1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,738
# I'm mad about the boy

2
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:25,838
# I know it's stupid to be
mad about the boy

3
00:00:27,557 --> 00:00:32,048
# I'm so ashamed of it,
but must admit

4
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:39,142
# The sleepless nights
I've had about the boy

5
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:46,099
# On the silver screen

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:52,272
# He melts my foolish heart
in every single scene

7
00:00:54,414 --> 00:00:57,198
# Although I'm quite aware

8
00:00:57,332 --> 00:01:05,699
# That here and there are traces...
of the cad about the boy

9
00:01:09,218 --> 00:01:14,125
# And Lord knows, I'm not a fool girl

10
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,923
# I really shouldn't care

11
00:01:23,022 --> 00:01:26,803
# Lord knows, I'm not a schoolgirl

12
00:01:26,943 --> 00:01:33,983
# In the flurry of her first affair

13
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:45,069
# Will it ever cloy, this odd diversity
of misery and joy?

14
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:51,831
# I'm feeling quite insane
and young again

15
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:59,253
# And all because I'm mad
about the boy

16
00:02:14,152 --> 00:02:18,525
# I'm feeling quite insane
and young again

17
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:23,562
# And all because I'm...

18
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:30,736
#... mad about the boy #

19
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:50,094
She's the first lady racer.
- But she didn't actually win.

20
00:02:50,226 --> 00:02:54,599
She crossed the line first.
It's so exciting.

21
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,100
Not nearly as exciting
as crossing your mother.

22
00:02:57,232 --> 00:02:59,721
I think we can all ignore that.

23
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:02,893
Oh, what is that man doing?

24
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:08,609
Jackson!

25
00:03:08,742 --> 00:03:10,899
Madam?
- What did I tell you?

26
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:15,244
Put the camellias by the front door
before the guests arrive!

27
00:03:15,374 --> 00:03:16,831
Furber.
- Madam?

28
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,620
Salvage any of Jackson's appalling
pruning and send it to Mrs Holborough

29
00:03:20,753 --> 00:03:25,624
who's kindly offered up a leg of mutton
for dinner, which you'll fetch, Marion.

30
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:28,756
But Reverend Burton has asked me
to drain the font.

31
00:03:28,886 --> 00:03:32,168
My hands are clearly full.
- I'll go.

32
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:35,588
Uncle George has posted
the most grizzly clippings

33
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:37,431
of the Valentine's Day Massacre!

34
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,803
Hilda.

35
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:43,511
Seven terrified men cut down
in a hail of automatic gun fire!

36
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:47,892
Made worse by the strays that
came to lap the curdled blood.

37
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:51,475
Hilda...
- The Devil Dogs! The Hounds of Hell!

38
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:54,364
The leg of lamb! Now.

39
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:04,115
Why we try and marry her off to gentry
when plainly she'd prefer an undertaker.

40
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:08,245
Seating. I'm putting Sarah on your left
and Philip on your right,

41
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,047
so please try and make an effort
to be civil.

42
00:04:11,174 --> 00:04:15,796
Right... I shall go and brush up
on my very small talk.

43
00:04:17,095 --> 00:04:19,335
It might be an awkward meal.

44
00:04:19,472 --> 00:04:23,253
For all we know Sarah's grazing
in greener pastures.

45
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:28,429
Whilst your brother sows his wild oats
in the South of France with his floozy?

46
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:33,720
No. We'll keep the home fires burning
until his highness wanders home.

47
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,649
Hmm. Like father did?

48
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:38,350
Yes. Like your father did.

49
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:50,912
I've got news, everybody!

50
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:55,158
You all right, sir?
- No. Are you?

51
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:58,080
Coping, sir.
- Hear, hear. Well done.

52
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:01,167
Well done? They look like
they're waiting for a firing squad.

53
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,674
Can't you make them more relaxed?
- Last meal and a cigarette, perhaps?

54
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:10,012
I can't believe it. You'll never guess.

55
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,007
Houdini escaped the Chinese water
torture only to die of a burst appendix.

56
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,477
How ghastly!
Oh, and Mother's got a telegram.

57
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:21,022
"Mr and Mrs Whittaker". Your mother.

58
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,479
What's it say, Father?

59
00:05:25,448 --> 00:05:27,735
Perhaps your mother
should read this first.

60
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:32,608
Oh! That stupid, stupid, stupid boy!

61
00:05:32,746 --> 00:05:35,661
What's happened?
Has there been an accident?

62
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,824
It's John, he's married that f-f-f...
- Francophile?

63
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,365
F-f-f...
- Photographer?

64
00:05:41,504 --> 00:05:44,207
Pharmacist?
- Why are you smirking?

65
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:47,504
Deploying a smile. One member
of this family may actually be happy.

66
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:51,332
Don't be absurd! We don't know
anything about this woman. Furber!

67
00:05:51,472 --> 00:05:53,178
Furber!

68
00:05:53,307 --> 00:05:55,878
Oh, not again!
- Madam.

69
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:58,092
Lord have mercy.

70
00:05:58,228 --> 00:06:01,843
Mister John is coming home with his...
with his wife.

71
00:06:01,981 --> 00:06:04,304
Yes. Their bags have just arrived.
Congratulations, Madam.

72
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:08,305
I'll be the judge of that. Clear up this
mess and get Cook to send up a ham.

73
00:06:08,446 --> 00:06:12,439
This is from Dover. They'll be half way.
- Yes, Furber. Dress the mutton as ham.

74
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:14,731
Very sharp,
don't cut yourself.

75
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:17,403
John married the floozy.
How exciting!

76
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:35,291
# A room with a view and you

77
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:38,342
# And no one to worry us

78
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:44,421
# No one to hurry us through
...this dream we found #

79
00:06:47,104 --> 00:06:50,684
There she blows.
Behold the country cottage.

80
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:52,891
Oh, Lord, it's enormous.

81
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:56,973
So, I lied about gingerbread hedges
and obese little children.

82
00:06:57,114 --> 00:07:00,645
How hard to swim is the moat?
- Smoke and mirrors, darling.

83
00:07:00,783 --> 00:07:02,691
Smoke and mirrors.

84
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:08,944
Oh, by the by, smoking... don't.
Apparently it wilts the azaleas.

85
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,745
That makes no sense. Speak English.
- All will be revealed, darling.

86
00:07:14,838 --> 00:07:19,460
Oh, give me back the wheel of my car.
I'm going back to Detroit!

87
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:26,713
How romantic!

88
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:30,013
Here they come! Oh, Furber!

89
00:07:30,144 --> 00:07:32,633
Mister John and his wife
are about to arrive.

90
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:35,639
I can't see them.
- Your tunnel vision.

91
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,771
Ooh!

92
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,238
Smile, Marion.
- I don't feel like smiling.

93
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:48,944
You're English, dear. Fake it.

94
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,076
The prodigal son returns
in a blaze of gravel.

95
00:08:02,213 --> 00:08:04,500
Father! You shaved.

96
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:09,837
Welcome, Madam.

97
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:12,720
You look gorgeous.

98
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:14,970
It's so lovely to see you.

99
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:22,100
Oh, darling. Sorry, sorry!

100
00:08:24,777 --> 00:08:27,265
This is my wife, Larita.

101
00:08:28,362 --> 00:08:31,644
Mrs Whittaker, the pleasure is all mine.

102
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:33,323
Oh, you're American.

103
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,199
And very welcome. Jim Whittaker.
- This is my father.

104
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:38,946
I fought alongside many
of your countrymen, Larita,

105
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,747
and I must say it's an honour
to have a comrade in the family.

106
00:08:41,874 --> 00:08:45,038
Thank you.
I do hope I'm not a disappointment.

107
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:47,622
Far from it.
- And my two little blisters.

108
00:08:47,755 --> 00:08:49,414
Hilda and Marion.

109
00:08:49,548 --> 00:08:52,215
Aren't you the woman
who won the Grand Prix?

110
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:54,000
First place, before disqualification.

111
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:58,129
Apparently you need chest hair
to change gears in Monaco.

112
00:08:58,265 --> 00:09:02,175
I saw you in the paper.
I cut your head out. I could just die!

113
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,965
Furber, that suitcase
to the drawing room, and do be careful.

114
00:09:08,106 --> 00:09:11,223
Marion... Golly, you're not a bit
like what we imagined.

115
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:14,274
Somewhat older, I expect.
Awfully sorry about that.

116
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:19,317
Before the frostbite sets in...

117
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:23,740
I'm looking forward to getting acquainted
with the mother of my "Panda".

118
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,904
You'll find me quite uncomplicated,
I'm afraid.

119
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,031
Oh! What are you doing?

120
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:31,323
Carrying you over the finish line.

121
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:38,463
Venus de Milo meet my Venus Detroit.

122
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:40,133
Oh, hello.

123
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:42,584
Mother's turned our old nursery
into a boudoir.

124
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:44,795
I wouldn't exactly call
it a boudoir, Hilda.

125
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,094
Marvellous. All those grubby memories
of Little Johnnie.

126
00:09:48,225 --> 00:09:50,299
We had no time
to raid the hothouse.

127
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:52,675
I only hope we can make you
comfortable.

128
00:09:52,814 --> 00:09:56,014
Don't go to any trouble.
We're only staying a few days.

129
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,517
Aren't we, Johnnie?
- Of course.

130
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:02,940
And for our next surprise...

131
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:09,736
What on earth is that?

132
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:13,574
His master's voice!
A wedding gift from us to you all.

133
00:10:13,707 --> 00:10:17,322
How divine! You should've
got married years ago!

134
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:24,416
#... another June,
another sunny honeymoon

135
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:30,665
# Another season, another reason
for making whoopee... #

136
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:35,171
Come on, little blister. Twirl for me.

137
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:46,102
Oh, a Continental education.
Not all of us have been so fortunate.

138
00:10:46,237 --> 00:10:49,400
An emotional depiction of the French
postal service, Mrs Whittaker.

139
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:52,364
Come now, not Mrs Whittaker.
It's "Mother" now.

140
00:10:52,492 --> 00:10:55,359
I don't think we're quite ready
for that yet.

141
00:10:55,495 --> 00:11:01,693
Since time is so clearly against us, why
don't you show Larita up to the nursery?

142
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,322
Dinner's at 8:00.

143
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:07,495
You didn't tell them?
- One bombshell at a time, darling.

144
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:12,169
That's not fair! Your poor mother.
How long are we staying?

145
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:14,208
A few days?

146
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:19,167
I shoulder the shortcomings of this family
and what do I get in return? A few days!

147
00:11:19,308 --> 00:11:22,010
Look at her. What am I supposed
to do with the bauble of a woman?

148
00:11:22,143 --> 00:11:24,300
Hang her?
- I think she's splendid.

149
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:28,017
Do you, Hilda? Well, we can all relax.
- She's not what I expected.

150
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:29,891
She's exactly
what I expected.

151
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:33,473
Surely not exactly? She wasn't drunk.
- Oh, very funny, Jim.

152
00:11:33,612 --> 00:11:37,227
Reduce this to the burlesque.
- She looks so expensive!

153
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:39,819
Very.
- Hmm. I like her.

154
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,652
Yes, Jim. We all know what you like.

155
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:44,161
Mother!

156
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,573
Oh, we have all been sent
to our "wombs".

157
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,999
And so toasty.
- Economics in action.

158
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,086
She keeps half the house closed
to save on heating.

159
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,840
That explains the frosty reception.

160
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,304
Well, darling. Let me warm you up.

161
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:33,704
Well?
- She's lovely, I'm very proud of you.

162
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,658
Thanks, Father.

163
00:12:35,793 --> 00:12:39,953
John? How long is a few days?

164
00:12:40,088 --> 00:12:43,169
Mother, Larita and I would like
to find a home in London.

165
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,997
But this is your home.
- A home of their own.

166
00:12:49,138 --> 00:12:51,424
But Panda, we need you here.

167
00:12:51,556 --> 00:12:55,929
Since you went off around the Riviera,
we've had to let go of six more people.

168
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,300
If you'd just listened to me
and taken on some machinery.

169
00:12:58,438 --> 00:13:01,851
Wouldn't that be a good idea? I could
run the entire estate single-handedly.

170
00:13:01,983 --> 00:13:05,680
Congratulations on your insight
and your spontaneity.

171
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,102
Sarah and Philip are coming to dinner
tonight, and I have got a table plan

172
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,563
that will take the League
of Nations to unravel.

173
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:16,654
Tonight? That's absolutely splendid!
- Don't be so fickle in your affections.

174
00:13:16,788 --> 00:13:19,075
Sarah might not be
as accommodating as you expect.

175
00:13:19,207 --> 00:13:21,162
Codswallop. She'll be delighted.

176
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:25,452
If mother was so desperate for her hand
in marriage, she should've asked herself!

177
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:27,744
Strange as it may seem,
I agree with your sister.

178
00:13:27,882 --> 00:13:29,623
I think you're wrong.

179
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:33,170
On certain things, yes. Call her.

180
00:13:33,302 --> 00:13:35,009
Really?
- Really.

181
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:39,381
Really! If Edgar were here,
he'd do the manly thing.

182
00:13:39,517 --> 00:13:42,006
What? Run away?

183
00:13:46,106 --> 00:13:47,931
Here they come!

184
00:14:02,371 --> 00:14:06,234
And the chequered flag goes to...
Fast work, John!

185
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:10,534
I should've written, but it happened
so fast, I didn't know where I was.

186
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,874
In Larita's arms, it seems.

187
00:14:13,005 --> 00:14:16,287
Please don't be disappointed.
- Of course I'm disappointed.

188
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:19,339
But tell me you're happy,
and I'll tell you you're forgiven.

189
00:14:19,469 --> 00:14:23,084
# You're the top,
you're Mahatma Gandhi! #

190
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:25,793
Panda, don't break out
the brandy just yet.

191
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:27,675
The hell we're not.

192
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:31,887
Have I missed something?
- Let sleeping cows stand.

193
00:14:32,022 --> 00:14:33,930
Oh, you plonker!

194
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:37,147
Rule one, push sleeping cow.

195
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,683
Rule two, get out of the way.

196
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,391
Rule three, remember rule two.

197
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:45,103
Sarah!
It's so lovely to see you.

198
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:47,529
I hear your poor father
is not having a good day.

199
00:14:47,662 --> 00:14:50,232
I'm afraid not. He sends his love.

200
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:53,785
You are a jolly good sport,
turning up like this, that's all I can say.

201
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:57,164
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Larita is such a pretty name.

202
00:14:57,295 --> 00:15:00,707
Yes. Excellent for musical comedy.
Hilda!

203
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,956
I hear the cow's in a terrible way.
- I've sent flowers.

204
00:15:04,093 --> 00:15:06,297
And did she eat them?
Touché!

205
00:15:06,428 --> 00:15:08,253
Good evening to you all.

206
00:15:09,097 --> 00:15:11,134
Nobody told me tonight
was fancy dress!

207
00:15:11,265 --> 00:15:14,299
Then why have you come
as the village idiot?

208
00:15:15,853 --> 00:15:18,258
I think I'm snagged.

209
00:15:18,398 --> 00:15:20,637
Let me help you with that.

210
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,102
Holy mother!

211
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,523
Panda? You're forgiven... tenfold.

212
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:43,029
Sarah Hurst, I'd like to introduce
my wife, Larita Whittaker.

213
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,203
Gosh, I do like the sound of that.

214
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:48,543
Sarah... finally.

215
00:15:48,674 --> 00:15:52,289
Johnnie talks about you constantly.
- How very annoying for you.

216
00:15:52,427 --> 00:15:57,464
I hope we can be friends.
- We already are. Congratulations.

217
00:15:57,599 --> 00:16:00,597
Er... I'd like to be friends, too.

218
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:04,389
Larita, my tiresome brother...
- The dishonourable Philip Hurst.

219
00:16:04,522 --> 00:16:06,927
Charmed, my dear lady.
Indeed.

220
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,472
Philip, won't you escort me in?

221
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,857
Of course,
my beautiful, little Sausage Fingers.

222
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:15,606
That's whet my appetite.
Shall we adjourn to the dining room?

223
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,731
And toast my beautiful bride.

224
00:16:17,866 --> 00:16:20,568
Had we known there was to be
a wedding reception,

225
00:16:20,703 --> 00:16:23,191
we could've lashed out on taffeta!

226
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:27,159
She's a lot like drowning:
quite pleasant once you stop struggling.

227
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:31,500
So, John, was Larita's
family able to attend the wedding?

228
00:16:38,343 --> 00:16:39,919
More cabbage, Madam?

229
00:16:40,054 --> 00:16:42,673
There's lots to do, Larita.
You ride, don't you?

230
00:16:42,806 --> 00:16:45,129
Boats, cars or planes?

231
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:48,715
No, horses, silly.
- Ah, yes, horses.

232
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:51,555
Faulty steering and unreliable brakes.

233
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:54,854
I'm stealing that for Stirrup Cup!

234
00:16:54,984 --> 00:16:57,022
Stirrup what?
- Cup.

235
00:16:57,152 --> 00:16:59,901
Every November, Philip and Sarah's
family host the hunt.

236
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:02,269
Wait until you meet their father,
Lord Hurst, he's terrific.

237
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:06,235
And Lady Hurst?
- Was terrific, until she... stopped.

238
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:10,154
Stopped what?
- Living.

239
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:13,577
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that.

240
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:19,414
Between father's polio
and Philip's mania for tipping cows...

241
00:17:19,548 --> 00:17:21,503
Can we please just drop the cows?

242
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:24,121
I think we'll give the fox a break
this year.

243
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,633
Oh, no hunt? Mrs Winston gave me
her saddle. I've had a wax.

244
00:17:30,391 --> 00:17:33,638
Your father and I conspired to make
John the Master of the Hunt.

245
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:37,015
People come from far and wide.
It's such a shame to disappoint them.

246
00:17:37,147 --> 00:17:38,889
Very thoughtful, Mother.

247
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:41,725
You do hunt,
I take it, Larita?

248
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,941
Hypocrites, gossips
or defenceless animals?

249
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,349
Bravo!

250
00:17:46,488 --> 00:17:48,525
You wouldn't get her to the start.

251
00:17:48,657 --> 00:17:52,272
We have another
conscientious objector, Father.

252
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,653
Company! Do you object to the circus
or the slaughter, Major?

253
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,195
I support Sheppard's position
on pacifism.

254
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:03,197
Good for you.
So, when does the carnage begin?

255
00:18:03,337 --> 00:18:06,999
After the War Widow's Revue,
but before the craft fair,

256
00:18:07,132 --> 00:18:09,004
in between the Dog Show and the shoot.

257
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:13,458
Don't forget the highlight. Mother's
Christmas dance is the hot ticket.

258
00:18:13,597 --> 00:18:16,760
She's ordered the most exquisite
Japanese lanterns.

259
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,461
From Japan?
- No, Fortnum & Mason's.

260
00:18:19,602 --> 00:18:23,263
Oh, yes.
Prepare for a whirlwind, Larita.

261
00:18:24,647 --> 00:18:26,354
I'm breathless already.

262
00:18:30,278 --> 00:18:33,441
I won't make it to Christmas.
You won't need to.

263
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:36,108
I won't make it to breakfast!
What were we just eating?

264
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,812
The lumpy grey and beige concoction?

265
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:43,076
Oh, yes. That's the word
I was looking for..."greige".

266
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,618
Absolutely no idea.
But it is the speciality of the house.

267
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:50,034
Incoming! Have you met my namesake?
He's very good in bed.

268
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,838
Shh! They'll hear you.
- I don't care.

269
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,588
I do.

270
00:18:55,842 --> 00:18:58,591
I know we need the heat,
but please don't smoke.

271
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,090
Mother's clairvoyant about these things.

272
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,676
She loathes me, Johnnie.

273
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,338
I'm a gold-digger, burrowing in
from the land of opportunists.

274
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:11,301
Your father's an interesting study,
though.

275
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:13,513
Quietly sardonic. I like that in a man.

276
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,932
That won't earn you many
brownie points under this roof.

277
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,150
After the Armistice,
Father didn't come straight home.

278
00:19:22,282 --> 00:19:25,694
He caroused around France and Italy,
drinking, having affairs...

279
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:29,276
A lot of men did similar...
couldn't settle down.

280
00:19:29,414 --> 00:19:32,780
Why didn't she go after him?
- A question of pride.

281
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:35,038
He finally just wandered home.

282
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:38,369
Still a bit of a sore point.
We try not to speak about it.

283
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:39,915
Except in public.

284
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:42,963
You see, she feels
she's missed out on something.

285
00:19:43,093 --> 00:19:45,664
Which means, of course,
she's missed out on everything.

286
00:19:45,803 --> 00:19:49,251
Exactly. The war robbed her
of all her expectations.

287
00:19:49,391 --> 00:19:52,093
She takes one look
at a woman like you...

288
00:19:52,226 --> 00:19:55,473
The harlot stealing into the nursery...

289
00:19:55,604 --> 00:19:57,760
The delicious concubine...

290
00:19:57,898 --> 00:19:59,889
...with the delectable ears...

291
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:02,184
...nose...

292
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,193
...neck.

293
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,523
I could just...

294
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,364
...eat you.

295
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:12,898
After that meal I'm not surprised.

296
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:26,081
# '... I'm mad about the boy! ' #

297
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,868
Dear Lord, thank you for bringing
John and his floozy home safely.

298
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:23,672
'Hmm... John! '

299
00:21:32,608 --> 00:21:36,305
Why is Larita always so late?
- You can't hurry perfection.

300
00:21:36,445 --> 00:21:40,818
Edgar was never late for a meal.
- He's missed a few lately.

301
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:44,527
Good morning.
How are we all on this glorious day?

302
00:21:44,661 --> 00:21:48,358
There she is! Morning, darling.

303
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,538
What would Madam like for breakfast?

304
00:21:54,294 --> 00:21:57,327
I think Madam will get more sustenance
from a kipper.

305
00:21:57,464 --> 00:22:00,710
But it won't be as much fun.
- Aren't you riding with us?

306
00:22:00,842 --> 00:22:03,165
Darling, I think it's about high time

307
00:22:03,302 --> 00:22:07,248
that your mother and I have
an intimate tête-à-tête.

308
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:10,836
Just us girls.
- Lovely.

309
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:13,381
What a frightening thought.

310
00:22:15,772 --> 00:22:22,977
Two hemispheres under one roof.
Papua New Guinea, India, the Argentine.

311
00:22:26,532 --> 00:22:29,446
I may not have travelled,
but the world has come to me.

312
00:22:29,576 --> 00:22:32,823
Are you coming down with something?

313
00:22:32,954 --> 00:22:36,154
Pollen.
But if I hold my breath long enough...

314
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,032
How peculiar.

315
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:40,453
Which is why we should
get to know one another.

316
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:43,499
Where does one start?
- Shall I make headway?

317
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:47,209
I was born in Detroit.
My father worked in the steel plant.

318
00:22:47,341 --> 00:22:50,008
He was one of the first
lured over to Henry Ford.

319
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:52,126
Ah, hence the love of motoring?

320
00:22:52,263 --> 00:22:54,716
Yes, but I also love animals.

321
00:22:54,848 --> 00:22:57,004
I am a city girl.
I take chickens to the vet.

322
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,765
Oh!

323
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:03,018
You can't be squeamish about livestock
now that you are living in the country.

324
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,222
Which was never my intention.

325
00:23:05,357 --> 00:23:08,225
I was happily carving out a niche
for myself on the race circuit

326
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,650
when I was unexpectedly flagged down
by someone irresistible.

327
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:18,313
Remarrying was the farthest thing
from my mind.

328
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,036
I see...

329
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,325
May I ask?

330
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:30,831
Oh, dead, unfortunately. No children.

331
00:23:30,964 --> 00:23:34,958
Oh...
How disappointing for you.

332
00:23:35,093 --> 00:23:37,463
Still, he provided well, though?

333
00:23:37,595 --> 00:23:42,383
Yes, but there were a lot of hidden costs
associated with his passing.

334
00:23:42,516 --> 00:23:47,506
Oh, that beautiful motor car... Surely,
you must have independent means?

335
00:23:47,646 --> 00:23:50,348
I'm more than happy
to discuss my means,

336
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:52,768
but I think you'll be a tad disappointed.

337
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:55,271
The car is my sole source of income.

338
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:58,567
Which makes living in London
an imperative.

339
00:23:58,697 --> 00:24:01,185
But what will John do in the city?

340
00:24:01,325 --> 00:24:03,695
Work. It's not uncommon.

341
00:24:03,827 --> 00:24:05,485
Oh!

342
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,661
John was brought up in the country,
Larita.

343
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,911
Where will he work?

344
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:15,953
Chalk Farm, perhaps?
Or St-Martin-In-The-Fields?

345
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:20,545
I know this is not perfect so that's
why I'm asking for your guidance.

346
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:23,957
So, please, how can I make this
pleasant for everybody?

347
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:28,918
Well, erm... wartime experience dictates
that you keep your head down

348
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:31,013
and you fit in as well as you can.

349
00:24:31,143 --> 00:24:35,884
Oh, there's a war on?
- Oh, no... not necessarily.

350
00:24:36,815 --> 00:24:39,979
Australian mimosa. Mmm... beautiful.

351
00:24:41,277 --> 00:24:43,564
Oh...

352
00:24:48,575 --> 00:24:52,783
And then the British troops opened fire...
How grizzly!

353
00:24:52,913 --> 00:24:56,408
How'd it go, Mother?
- Oh, marvellous!

354
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:57,784
Marvellous.

355
00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:05,955
Thanks for the invitation!

356
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,970
Thanks for the invitation!

357
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,635
Oh, it's Lord Hurst!

358
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:21,683
I fear storm clouds are gathering,
Mrs Whit.

359
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:23,934
Stop being maudlin, Father.

360
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:26,221
It's the future!
- Spanner!

361
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:30,815
Father, allow me to introduce
Panda's new chauffeuse.

362
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:34,609
Lovely La-La-Larita.
- Watch it, Philip.

363
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:38,107
My son is prone to fabrication,
but I can see on this occasion

364
00:25:38,244 --> 00:25:40,946
he has been perfectly frank,
Mrs Whittaker.

365
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:46,075
Yes, that's right.
There are two of us now.

366
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,912
No shortage of wits
around here any more.

367
00:25:49,046 --> 00:25:52,577
OK, stand back! I give you, the future!

368
00:25:57,096 --> 00:26:00,047
All right, John.
You can take my baby out for a spin.

369
00:26:01,766 --> 00:26:05,178
Ha-ha! Allergies.
She inflates like a puffer fish.

370
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:07,847
You just want to squeeze her
until she pops.

371
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,764
#... working at the car wash

372
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:17,683
# You might not ever strike it rich

373
00:26:19,324 --> 00:26:22,405
# But let me tell you,
it's better than digging a ditch

374
00:26:22,535 --> 00:26:25,948
# Working at the car wash!

375
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,782
# Working at the car wash, man

376
00:26:28,915 --> 00:26:31,664
# Come on, now, sing it to me

377
00:26:32,711 --> 00:26:35,330
# It's better than digging a ditch... #

378
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:50,139
The missus is a bit trigger-happy
this week.

379
00:26:50,268 --> 00:26:52,223
Bleeding tinnitus is killing me.

380
00:26:52,353 --> 00:26:56,643
I like the new Mrs Whit. Reminds me
of the old one before the war.

381
00:26:56,774 --> 00:26:59,974
Only more reasonable. You can tell
she's run her own household.

382
00:27:00,109 --> 00:27:01,816
Oh, be silent!

383
00:27:01,945 --> 00:27:05,725
Good morning,
Furber, Jackson, Millie, and?

384
00:27:05,865 --> 00:27:08,650
Cook, I can't call you a verb.
Your name?

385
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:10,951
Beatrice.

386
00:27:14,498 --> 00:27:18,538
All right, all right... it's Doris.
Sorry, Madam.

387
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:21,204
Always wanted to be called Beatrice.

388
00:27:21,337 --> 00:27:25,994
Well, Beatrice, would you mind
if I helped myself in the mornings?

389
00:27:26,134 --> 00:27:29,251
I fear I shall be rising later and later.

390
00:27:29,387 --> 00:27:31,875
Well... if it pleases, Mrs Whit.

391
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:35,971
The point of the bell?

392
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,300
When I ring it, you come to me,
not the other way round!

393
00:27:40,438 --> 00:27:42,559
Larita. May I have a word?

394
00:27:43,774 --> 00:27:45,480
Come along!

395
00:27:48,403 --> 00:27:51,318
Would you please refrain
from chatting to the staff?

396
00:27:51,447 --> 00:27:54,196
It's chore enough trying to keep
this motley crew together.

397
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:58,401
I had a brilliant French maid in Paris.
Perhaps I should send for her?

398
00:27:58,537 --> 00:28:00,943
Thank you, no... erm...

399
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:05,454
I'd prefer to keep English
the first language in this household.

400
00:28:05,585 --> 00:28:07,208
Ah, there you are.

401
00:28:07,337 --> 00:28:09,826
I say! Anyone for tennis?

402
00:28:09,964 --> 00:28:11,291
Yes. You!

403
00:28:11,424 --> 00:28:13,829
John, Shackleton wouldn't let
a dog out today!

404
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:16,041
The fog has lifted
and Whittakers don't do winter.

405
00:28:16,178 --> 00:28:19,425
You go ahead, darling.
I'll play with myself.

406
00:28:19,557 --> 00:28:22,674
No, really. I'm a lot of fun.
- Ooh...

407
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,512
John!
It's brass monkeys out here!

408
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:32,936
Day one of the Antarctic Open.
Mister Whittaker to serve.

409
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,484
Hole in one!
- Deuce.

410
00:28:38,615 --> 00:28:42,561
I see your pair of deuces
and I raise you a tenner.

411
00:28:42,702 --> 00:28:45,653
The Titanic could have hit that!

412
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:49,699
Sarah, you're an embarrassment to
the family name. I'll have you killed.

413
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:53,530
Good God! What's wrong with you?
No! Stop now!

414
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:56,870
Stop, everybody! Listen!
- Shoot the court jester!

415
00:28:57,007 --> 00:29:00,953
Nice backhand!
- Is that a backhand compliment?

416
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:04,294
# Mad dogs and Englishmen
go out in the midday sun!

417
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:07,926
# The Japanese don't care to,
the Chinese wouldn't dare to

418
00:29:08,058 --> 00:29:10,973
# Hindus and Argentines sleep firmly
from twelve to one

419
00:29:11,103 --> 00:29:14,433
# But Englishmen detest a siesta... #

420
00:29:14,563 --> 00:29:18,059
Laurel and Hardy step up
to the crease. The fillies are lining up.

421
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:21,973
Miss Hilda Whittaker looking most
fetching in her feed bag and bridle!

422
00:29:28,785 --> 00:29:30,941
One woman's heaven...

423
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,202
Oh, she's absolutely beautiful.

424
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:40,204
Broken, tarnished
and completely useless.

425
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:45,545
Things guaranteed
to keep my wife at bay.

426
00:29:45,675 --> 00:29:47,381
May I?

427
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,915
If you don't mind
getting your hands dirty.

428
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:53,882
In Detroit, what we lack in dirt,
we make up for in filth.

429
00:29:54,016 --> 00:29:57,132
Your first husband
from that neck of the woods?

430
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:59,757
Oh... well, word gets about.

431
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,850
So where is he now?
- Dead.

432
00:30:07,028 --> 00:30:08,900
Cancer.

433
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,353
He was a fair bit older than me.

434
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:15,235
I spent a while playing the unmerry
widow but the black wore thin.

435
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:19,815
You didn't care for him, I gather?
- I cared too much.

436
00:30:19,956 --> 00:30:23,784
Life was just such an unpleasant
experience for the man, I...

437
00:30:24,377 --> 00:30:27,659
I'd be a liar to say I wasn't glad
when he was relieved of it.

438
00:30:36,263 --> 00:30:39,629
When were you last in France?
- Just after the war?

439
00:30:39,766 --> 00:30:41,721
On a personal reconnaissance,

440
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:46,673
trying to ascertain what exactly
all those fine young men had died for.

441
00:30:48,315 --> 00:30:51,064
Apparently, I'm of the romantic
Lost Generation.

442
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:54,101
What did you lose?

443
00:30:55,113 --> 00:30:57,187
I'm not sure.

444
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:57,828
Oh, hello... hello.

445
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,789
Who was the tiny tank?
Who's a pretty, little, cheeky chorizo?

446
00:32:03,091 --> 00:32:06,538
On bended knees,
please come and play with me.

447
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:08,880
Johnnie dear,
you know how much I love you,

448
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:12,709
so please try to take this
in the best possible light.

449
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,926
I'm getting a machine gun
and mowing down your entire family.

450
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:20,676
That's fairly disappointing. I thought
you and Father were getting along.

451
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:23,434
Yes, I might spare the men folk.

452
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:27,264
But it's awfully dispiriting.
We have absolutely no privacy here.

453
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:29,892
I never needed any privacy before.
This is my home.

454
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:32,734
It's not mine.
And I very much want one.

455
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,232
# We're all alone,
no chaperone can get our number

456
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:43,496
# The world's aslumber,
let's misbehave

457
00:32:46,713 --> 00:32:49,415
Timing is everything, you little brute!

458
00:32:49,548 --> 00:32:52,830
Umpire at least.
Philip is pining for you.

459
00:32:52,969 --> 00:32:56,879
If I knew you played tennis, I never
would've signed the marriage certificate!

460
00:32:57,014 --> 00:32:58,755
Ow!

461
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:14,604
Not a bad day for it.

462
00:33:14,738 --> 00:33:16,528
Reading.

463
00:33:16,656 --> 00:33:19,524
My fiancé, Edgar,
was always hiding behind books.

464
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:24,151
Erm... you're needed on the tennis court.
John was just asking after you.

465
00:33:24,288 --> 00:33:27,488
Would you like to see
a photo of him... my Edgar?

466
00:33:27,624 --> 00:33:28,868
Poppy!

467
00:33:32,129 --> 00:33:35,292
That's Enrico Caruso.
- Who's dead, I know that...

468
00:33:35,423 --> 00:33:38,871
But if you ignore
the nose and the mouth...

469
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:42,422
...and the ears...
there's a striking resemblance.

470
00:33:44,348 --> 00:33:46,469
I don't actually have a picture of Edgar.

471
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:49,930
Well... mustn't keep you.

472
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:54,102
No, no. Of course. Looking forward
to getting stuck in to a good book.

473
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:56,269
Poppy!

474
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,103
You haven't seen the beast, have you?
- The dog?

475
00:33:59,235 --> 00:34:01,558
Nope. I haven't.

476
00:34:03,281 --> 00:34:04,738
Poppy!

477
00:34:10,662 --> 00:34:14,158
Oh, poor, poor Poppy. I'm so sorry.

478
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:15,998
Larita!

479
00:34:18,337 --> 00:34:22,876
I've been sent in to badger you.
Please help us make up doubles?

480
00:34:23,008 --> 00:34:27,665
Oh, Hilda, I can't. I'm only good
for the cocktails between sets.

481
00:34:27,804 --> 00:34:32,129
We're between sets now.
- You can't possibly want me on court.

482
00:34:33,434 --> 00:34:36,053
Philip! Go get him.

483
00:34:38,855 --> 00:34:40,810
Poppy!

484
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,392
Poppy!

485
00:34:44,527 --> 00:34:46,068
Poppy!

486
00:34:49,615 --> 00:34:51,440
What are you doing?
- Reading.

487
00:34:51,574 --> 00:34:54,607
"Sodom and Gomorrah:
A Biblical Story".

488
00:34:54,745 --> 00:34:57,280
Who gave you this filth?

489
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:04,075
Go and find the dog! Larita!

490
00:35:06,546 --> 00:35:10,492
Please refrain from giving my daughter
pornographic literature.

491
00:35:10,633 --> 00:35:12,126
Yes, yes, of course.

492
00:35:12,259 --> 00:35:14,926
Oh, and I've volunteered you and Hilda

493
00:35:15,054 --> 00:35:18,751
to perform the Dance of the Dying Swan
for the War Widows' Revue.

494
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:20,716
We're short on numbers.

495
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:23,304
Lovely. Anything to help.

496
00:35:23,437 --> 00:35:25,095
Have you seen the dog?

497
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,386
No. Not recently.

498
00:35:27,523 --> 00:35:31,387
Probably out seizing the sunshine
like everyone else.

499
00:35:35,281 --> 00:35:37,153
Poppy!

500
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,158
Furber!

501
00:35:45,415 --> 00:35:48,946
Oh, it's you, Madam. I'm sorry.
Can I get you anything?

502
00:35:49,085 --> 00:35:52,829
A shovel.
- Shovel. Of course.

503
00:35:53,547 --> 00:35:56,082
Go and get Philip a hot toddy.

504
00:35:56,216 --> 00:36:02,462
Philip. You look so... so... so...
- The suspense is killing me.

505
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:04,173
Poppy!

506
00:36:04,889 --> 00:36:07,460
Oh... sorry.
- It's fine.

507
00:36:16,026 --> 00:36:18,645
Your brother is such
a sharply honed twit.

508
00:36:21,322 --> 00:36:25,944
Where's our beautiful cougar hiding?
- Under a book, I expect.

509
00:36:26,077 --> 00:36:28,779
I wish she wouldn't slack indoors
so much.

510
00:36:28,912 --> 00:36:32,573
Some people would kill
to be indoors with Larita.

511
00:36:32,707 --> 00:36:34,781
She isn't built the same as us.

512
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:36,872
Still, it is annoying, though.

513
00:36:37,002 --> 00:36:39,835
You're such a sport,
always ready for anything.

514
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:45,913
I haven't got Lari's beauty
or charm or intelligence.

515
00:36:46,052 --> 00:36:48,754
She is clever, isn't she?
- Hmm...

516
00:36:48,888 --> 00:36:52,336
Clever... and bored.

517
00:36:52,475 --> 00:36:57,216
I don't understand it. I'm not bored,
you're not bored, nobody else is bored.

518
00:36:57,354 --> 00:36:59,973
Your father is, out of his mind.

519
00:37:00,106 --> 00:37:02,014
Father was born bored.

520
00:37:02,984 --> 00:37:05,437
If only she made an effort to play along.

521
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,141
Stop being so torturous, Panda.

522
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,816
You had her playing charades last night.
What more do you want?

523
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,983
John! John?

524
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,449
To tell the truth, I never really liked her.
Crabby, snappy, little bitch...

525
00:37:24,462 --> 00:37:27,579
I didn't like the dog much, either.

526
00:37:29,675 --> 00:37:33,088
Poor Poppy. Casualty of war.

527
00:37:36,222 --> 00:37:38,675
If I may be so bold, Madam?

528
00:37:38,808 --> 00:37:43,015
These people ride horses.
Lots of horses.

529
00:37:43,146 --> 00:37:46,061
It would be advantageous
to do the same.

530
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:51,230
And I thought Detroit was a tough town.

531
00:37:54,155 --> 00:38:01,230
# You do something to me

532
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:09,239
# Something that simply
mystifies me... #

533
00:38:12,922 --> 00:38:15,410
Oh, has your horse run out of gas?

534
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:26,838
Oh, John, don't hurt it.

535
00:38:26,977 --> 00:38:32,013
Far from it. We've got a hunt coming up.
Poor little mite needs a head start.

536
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,645
Go on... run!

537
00:38:38,695 --> 00:38:42,274
So much to learn about each other.

538
00:38:44,034 --> 00:38:48,857
My curriculum vitae. The brook
is the border of Sarah's property.

539
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:53,286
Mother always imagined
we'd join forces and invade Surrey.

540
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:59,117
Oh, and how about
those foot soldiers on high?

541
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:03,580
That's Davis, Lord Hurst's man.
And there's Lord Hurst...

542
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:05,957
Closely followed by my mother-in-law.

543
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:08,879
I wonder what the devil
they're surveying?

544
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:15,097
Are you disappointed
you didn't marry Sarah?

545
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:19,008
Of course not. We've seen each other
naked since we were one.

546
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:22,396
She's part of the... the... the...
scenery.

547
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,230
You can hack it a little while longer,
can't you?

548
00:39:26,363 --> 00:39:30,570
How long is a little?
And don't say two weeks again.

549
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,280
Well, there's the War Widows' Revue,
the craft fair...

550
00:39:34,412 --> 00:39:36,035
...the hunt.

551
00:39:36,164 --> 00:39:39,944
The memorial service...
- What memorial service?

552
00:39:41,835 --> 00:39:45,247
Friends, we are gathered here today

553
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,374
in remembrance
of our missing friend, Poppy.

554
00:39:49,508 --> 00:39:51,298
Oh, Poppy...

555
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:55,882
Wherever you have chosen
to sow your seeds,

556
00:39:56,015 --> 00:39:58,681
we pray that you are blooming.

557
00:39:58,808 --> 00:40:01,475
We pray that you have gone
to a better place.

558
00:40:01,603 --> 00:40:05,099
Shame we don't know
exactly where that place is...

559
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:08,762
Anyway, now for a eulogy
from Emily Dickinson, queen of mirth.

560
00:40:10,986 --> 00:40:15,809
"Because I could not stop for death,
he kindly stopped for me.

561
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:19,859
"The carriage held but just ourselves
and immortality."

562
00:40:19,994 --> 00:40:24,782
Or maybe the carriage didn't stop
and Poppy got squished.

563
00:40:24,915 --> 00:40:27,368
Scraped off the road
and put in a sausage...

564
00:40:27,502 --> 00:40:30,334
Oh, Hilda!

565
00:40:38,553 --> 00:40:40,840
Thank you, Mr Gribble.

566
00:40:41,596 --> 00:40:45,175
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

567
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:49,800
behold Reverend Burton
and Marion Whittaker

568
00:40:49,938 --> 00:40:55,093
as they reach for the scissors
in "Samson and Delilah".

569
00:41:06,745 --> 00:41:09,908
Hark! I hear my husband snore!

570
00:41:11,165 --> 00:41:15,538
What the hell happened to Delilah?
Looks like a sock full of oranges.

571
00:41:15,669 --> 00:41:21,951
I'll creep forth on padded foot
and relieve him of his ample follicles.

572
00:41:45,654 --> 00:41:48,985
How hilarious!
- It's meant to be a tragedy!

573
00:41:49,116 --> 00:41:51,521
Then you succeeded
beyond your wildest dreams.

574
00:41:51,661 --> 00:41:54,575
Your father seems
to have a fan.

575
00:41:54,704 --> 00:41:58,070
Don't read too much into it. She was
a godsend during mother's last months.

576
00:41:58,207 --> 00:42:00,956
Sometimes I wonder where they'd be
without each other.

577
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:03,574
My ample follicles are in dire need
of a trim.

578
00:42:05,964 --> 00:42:09,709
I wouldn't taunt the artistes,
my little dying swans. You're on next.

579
00:42:09,844 --> 00:42:13,672
I've encouraged my girls to undertake
something a little more contemporary.

580
00:42:13,805 --> 00:42:16,589
Hilda and I seem to have a talent
for the can-can.

581
00:42:16,724 --> 00:42:19,722
The traditional can-can,
performed without underwear?

582
00:42:19,853 --> 00:42:23,301
Oh, Philip!
- Anything for you, Philip.

583
00:42:23,438 --> 00:42:25,144
Yes, anything.

584
00:42:25,273 --> 00:42:28,141
That'll raise a bit more than money
for the war widows.

585
00:42:28,277 --> 00:42:31,725
I'm doubling my donation.
- Oh, Pinkie.

586
00:42:31,862 --> 00:42:34,148
Fans at the ready, gentlemen!

587
00:42:34,282 --> 00:42:37,398
All the way from gay Paris,

588
00:42:37,535 --> 00:42:40,449
I give you Miss Hilda Whittaker

589
00:42:40,578 --> 00:42:45,698
and, for her debut performance,
Mrs John Whittaker

590
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:48,997
doing 'The Can-Can'!

591
00:42:49,128 --> 00:42:51,084
Ooh!

592
00:42:55,592 --> 00:42:57,713
Ooh!

593
00:43:10,939 --> 00:43:13,345
Did... did you?

594
00:43:15,986 --> 00:43:20,976
Is it my imagination, or is your daughter
dancing without her scanties?

595
00:43:44,428 --> 00:43:45,802
Ow!

596
00:43:58,316 --> 00:44:00,105
Bravo!

597
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:22,322
It's not Lari's fault.
She said it was traditional!

598
00:44:22,462 --> 00:44:24,785
Philip said it, not Larita.
And it was a joke.

599
00:44:24,922 --> 00:44:27,209
Everyone understood that
except Nelly No Knickers here!

600
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:31,120
Hilda isn't as experienced
as your wife, John. No one is.

601
00:44:31,262 --> 00:44:34,462
If you're not prepared to have a straight
talk to her, then I certainly am.

602
00:44:34,597 --> 00:44:36,635
Don't be ridiculous.
You'll lose a finger.

603
00:44:36,767 --> 00:44:41,010
Lord Hurst will never speak to me.
- Rubbish. I saw you in the back fields.

604
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:43,894
Preparing the jumps for the hunt!

605
00:44:44,023 --> 00:44:47,768
I'm completely humiliated!
I'll never get a husband now!

606
00:44:47,901 --> 00:44:50,306
After tonight, I'd have thought
they'll be lining up round the block.

607
00:44:50,445 --> 00:44:53,609
I hate her! Hate, hate, hate her!

608
00:44:55,366 --> 00:44:58,731
The advance notices
are sensational, Mrs John.

609
00:45:09,171 --> 00:45:13,958
Is it my imagination or is the cutlery
particularly deafening this evening?

610
00:45:14,091 --> 00:45:17,955
I don't know how many times
I have to say this, Hilda. I am sorry.

611
00:45:18,094 --> 00:45:22,586
That's easy for you to say.
- It's surprisingly hard to be easy.

612
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:27,880
You're smiling, Jim.
- God forbid, the wind might change.

613
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:34,186
Hilda, if I had any inkling that you
were going to take me seriously...

614
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:36,558
You could have made an effort
to enjoy it less.

615
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:40,274
I had my underpants on.
I was having a grand time.

616
00:45:41,574 --> 00:45:46,776
It's not fair! You've got two husbands,
and I've had none.

617
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:49,827
Technically, I have one.
- But you've had two.

618
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,410
I've had two shoes
and it's a great deal more practical.

619
00:45:52,543 --> 00:45:56,074
I dare say you've worn down
more soles than that.

620
00:45:59,091 --> 00:46:01,081
John...

621
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:04,796
Marion, Larita's first husband died
of cancer. Stop being so callous.

622
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,595
Oh, I'm sure Marion
can appreciate the pain

623
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,507
of watching a loved one
slip through her fingers.

624
00:46:10,641 --> 00:46:12,632
She's scandalous!

625
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:16,847
You should hear what they're saying
about her in the village.

626
00:46:16,981 --> 00:46:19,221
Well, let's stop the wagging tongues,
shall we?

627
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:22,806
Is it true you've had
as many lovers as they say?

628
00:46:25,281 --> 00:46:28,481
Of course it's not true, Mrs Whittaker.

629
00:46:28,616 --> 00:46:31,567
Hardly any of them actually loved me.

630
00:46:34,247 --> 00:46:37,447
That was uncalled for.
I realise it was a joke, but still...

631
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:41,742
You threw me to the wolves in there.
- Marion hardly constitutes wolves.

632
00:46:41,878 --> 00:46:45,919
All right, you threw me to the voles.
Either way, you abandoned me.

633
00:46:46,049 --> 00:46:48,336
Your sisters need to be restrained.

634
00:46:48,468 --> 00:46:52,841
Restrained? Hilda breaks loose once
and she's almost institutionalised.

635
00:46:52,972 --> 00:46:55,756
And poor old Marion...
Edgar drops by for a cup of sugar,

636
00:46:55,891 --> 00:46:58,296
and mother has his name
engraved on the family crypt.

637
00:46:58,435 --> 00:47:01,102
I'm sorry but it really is very funny.
- Hilarious!

638
00:47:01,229 --> 00:47:03,469
Welcome to the petrified circus.

639
00:47:03,606 --> 00:47:07,019
Meet the resident contortionist
who can't bend any further.

640
00:47:07,151 --> 00:47:11,275
Then stop. Be yourself.
Let them live in your spell.

641
00:47:11,405 --> 00:47:16,358
# You do that voodoo
that you do so well... #

642
00:47:16,492 --> 00:47:20,818
You're right, of course. I'm a hypocrite,
pretending to be someone I'm not.

643
00:47:20,956 --> 00:47:23,788
Especially since it isn't working.

644
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:28,281
What the devil has that dog dug up?

645
00:47:31,297 --> 00:47:33,371
Pilot, what have you got there?

646
00:47:35,135 --> 00:47:37,505
How could you not tell us?

647
00:47:37,637 --> 00:47:41,085
Marion, it was an accident.
I am walking on eggshells here.

648
00:47:41,223 --> 00:47:45,845
And I believe I panicked.
And once again, I'm very, very sorry.

649
00:47:45,977 --> 00:47:49,308
How could you do it? How could you?

650
00:47:49,439 --> 00:47:54,262
I imagine she lowered her full weight
onto the Chihuahua beneath her.

651
00:47:56,154 --> 00:47:58,228
Marion, please.

652
00:47:58,365 --> 00:48:01,528
John, did you have anything
to do with this?

653
00:48:01,658 --> 00:48:05,569
No. No, I was the sole perpetrator
of Poppy's demise.

654
00:48:05,703 --> 00:48:08,654
And ever since
I have been wracked with guilt.

655
00:48:09,164 --> 00:48:13,158
Please, please, please
let me buy you a new dog.

656
00:48:14,378 --> 00:48:17,411
You might buy your loved ones
in the United States,

657
00:48:17,548 --> 00:48:19,834
but you can't in the United Kingdom.

658
00:48:19,966 --> 00:48:21,293
How unfortunate.

659
00:48:21,426 --> 00:48:25,206
You could at least show some remorse.

660
00:48:25,345 --> 00:48:29,837
I am full of remorse. I just refuse
to invest in amateur theatrics

661
00:48:29,976 --> 00:48:31,598
to convince you of my sincerity.

662
00:48:31,728 --> 00:48:34,928
That's not how I came off
the assembly line. I'm sorry.

663
00:48:35,064 --> 00:48:36,770
I can't change.

664
00:48:36,898 --> 00:48:41,223
Not for you...
not for anybody... any more.

665
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:47,900
And I wouldn't want her
any other way. So...

666
00:48:51,203 --> 00:48:56,026
Madam, the dog.
- Oh, stay back! Stay back!

667
00:48:57,417 --> 00:49:02,288
I knew it the second
I laid eyes on her. She's a killer.

668
00:49:02,422 --> 00:49:04,578
She sat on poor Poppy deliberately.

669
00:49:04,716 --> 00:49:07,418
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course she didn't.

670
00:49:07,551 --> 00:49:11,959
My brother has married a dog murderer.
She should be put down.

671
00:49:12,097 --> 00:49:14,004
Put through a divorce court.

672
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,012
The Lord does not
sanction divorce.

673
00:49:16,142 --> 00:49:19,508
The Lord is Almighty, Marion.
He can sanction anything he likes.

674
00:49:19,645 --> 00:49:21,553
The sooner they move out
the better.

675
00:49:21,689 --> 00:49:25,386
They move out?
John isn't going anywhere.

676
00:49:25,525 --> 00:49:27,350
Watch and learn.

677
00:49:32,865 --> 00:49:36,147
It's so unfair.
Why can't I have a room like this?

678
00:49:39,371 --> 00:49:42,701
I could die of envy!

679
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:45,286
Laying to rest this tragic incident,

680
00:49:45,419 --> 00:49:49,329
we've had this splendid set of rooms
made over for you, haven't we, Jim?

681
00:49:49,463 --> 00:49:52,663
Yes. My wife would like you
to rest in peace.

682
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,841
I even had an old friend of Johnnie's
brought down from the attic.

683
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:59,589
"Old Faithful Awaits
His Master's Return".

684
00:49:59,723 --> 00:50:02,638
I used to sleep under
that silly painting.

685
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:05,599
Very comforting, I'm sure,
but we're expected back in Mayfair.

686
00:50:05,728 --> 00:50:08,596
But these are the largest rooms
in the house.

687
00:50:08,731 --> 00:50:10,805
You'll find nothing like it in London.

688
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,014
She has a point.
- She always does.

689
00:50:13,151 --> 00:50:16,314
Sometimes I don't know
why you ever did wander home.

690
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:17,986
And miss all the fun?

691
00:50:18,614 --> 00:50:21,281
Cook would like to inform you,
Mrs Whittaker, the bird is stuffed.

692
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:23,199
Oh!

693
00:50:23,328 --> 00:50:25,402
What bird, hmm?

694
00:50:25,538 --> 00:50:28,453
Thursday is bubble and squeak.
I hadn't made any arrangements.

695
00:50:28,583 --> 00:50:30,620
Oh, but I have!

696
00:50:36,088 --> 00:50:40,212
In appreciation of your understanding
and for that delicious double bed.

697
00:50:40,342 --> 00:50:43,210
We'll think of you every time we use it.

698
00:50:50,435 --> 00:50:53,635
What exactly are we celebrating?
- Thanksgiving.

699
00:50:53,772 --> 00:50:55,809
Thanks for what, hmm?

700
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,519
The annihilation
of an entire indigenous people.

701
00:50:59,651 --> 00:51:02,566
A loving union of two great cultures.

702
00:51:02,696 --> 00:51:05,694
Just like us.
- How transcontinental.

703
00:51:05,824 --> 00:51:08,905
I can't believe you got into the kitchen.
- Beatrice did put up a fight.

704
00:51:09,034 --> 00:51:12,281
But technically I outrank her.
- Who's Beatrice?

705
00:51:12,413 --> 00:51:17,829
Your cook. Or now my undercook,
since I'm qualified cordon bleu.

706
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,116
That's a degree.

707
00:51:20,253 --> 00:51:24,827
Furber... take the vegetables down to
the kitchen and tell Cook to cook them.

708
00:51:24,966 --> 00:51:29,458
No, Furber, thank you.
I think I'll surprise my alimentary canal.

709
00:51:30,638 --> 00:51:34,134
Mother, if you don't mind, I'm going
to eat my meal before it gets cold.

710
00:51:34,266 --> 00:51:36,304
Furber, I've changed my mind,
bring it back!

711
00:51:36,435 --> 00:51:37,548
Me, too.

712
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,594
Gobble, gobble!

713
00:51:46,861 --> 00:51:48,318
Yes!

714
00:51:52,282 --> 00:51:53,905
Here's a tip, Hilda.

715
00:51:54,033 --> 00:51:57,481
A sure way to a man's heart is
through his stomach. Or his mother.

716
00:51:57,621 --> 00:52:01,994
Larita, look, I've found
another likeness of Edgar.

717
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:05,786
Marion, this is Fatty Arbuckle.
- Who's in jail, I know that.

718
00:52:05,919 --> 00:52:09,249
But if you cut out his cheeks
and give him a bald patch,

719
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,869
there's a striking resemblance...

720
00:52:12,008 --> 00:52:14,923
Edgar's away on a trip
across the pond,

721
00:52:15,053 --> 00:52:18,004
sewing his wild oats,
or something agricultural.

722
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,544
She's good, I'll give her that.
- I think you're over-reacting.

723
00:52:30,274 --> 00:52:32,845
Lari? Lari!

724
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:36,528
Not the vase! Not the vase!

725
00:52:36,655 --> 00:52:40,067
"Taking the corncockle buds
and bee-kissed roses

726
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,274
"roughly in his calloused hands,

727
00:52:42,411 --> 00:52:47,910
"his hot, moist tulip exploded
in her river of delights..."

728
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,005
Larita?

729
00:53:01,135 --> 00:53:03,256
Early Christmas present...

730
00:53:03,387 --> 00:53:06,634
For you, darling.
- Ooh, the mind boggles.

731
00:53:14,481 --> 00:53:15,938
Well, it's... it's...

732
00:53:16,065 --> 00:53:18,056
It's magnificent.
It's monstrous!

733
00:53:18,192 --> 00:53:22,731
It's me. I posed for a young Spaniard.
Don't you absolutely adore it?

734
00:53:22,863 --> 00:53:25,980
Very expressive, darling,
but I can't quite see you in it.

735
00:53:26,116 --> 00:53:27,657
You can see
everything else!

736
00:53:27,784 --> 00:53:30,533
You took your clothes off
in front of a total stranger?

737
00:53:30,662 --> 00:53:34,526
Of course she took her clothes off.
- I think it's unholy.

738
00:53:34,666 --> 00:53:40,165
I'm not sure I approve of you being nude.
You know, without... without me.

739
00:53:40,295 --> 00:53:41,752
Extraordinary.

740
00:53:42,923 --> 00:53:45,791
What exactly are you
hoping to achieve?

741
00:53:45,926 --> 00:53:48,711
Just trying to get into the swing
of things... Mother.

742
00:53:48,845 --> 00:53:54,675
Marvellous! Well, then, you'll be riding
in the hunt with us, won't you?

743
00:53:54,808 --> 00:53:57,842
I might be persuaded
if the painting stays.

744
00:53:57,978 --> 00:53:59,720
Hunt.
- Paint.

745
00:53:59,855 --> 00:54:01,597
Hunt.
- Paint.

746
00:54:01,731 --> 00:54:03,224
Hunt!

747
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:05,017
Very well.

748
00:54:06,986 --> 00:54:08,479
Hunt.

749
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:16,109
View, hello.

750
00:54:19,372 --> 00:54:23,069
Hello, everyone.
Good to see you. Richard.

751
00:54:23,209 --> 00:54:26,622
Morning, Jim!
After generations of false starts,

752
00:54:26,754 --> 00:54:29,373
we've finally managed
to combine our cavalry.

753
00:54:29,507 --> 00:54:32,209
Congratulations.
A marriage of minor convenience.

754
00:54:32,342 --> 00:54:34,167
You'll be fine, I promise.

755
00:54:34,303 --> 00:54:38,960
The second you have the Holborough
boy's eye, flirt outrageously.

756
00:54:39,098 --> 00:54:41,800
But Warwick Holborough has ears
like the Cambridge Cup!

757
00:54:41,935 --> 00:54:47,137
And Philip's the prize. Now, if you want
a man's attention... ignore him.

758
00:54:54,362 --> 00:54:57,609
Warwick the Wingnut
and Sausage Fingers?

759
00:54:57,741 --> 00:55:01,983
What a handsome couple.
They'll have puppies not children.

760
00:55:03,954 --> 00:55:07,818
Wait... there's something I need to say.

761
00:55:08,959 --> 00:55:12,325
I see you... you're wasted here.

762
00:55:12,462 --> 00:55:16,290
When the time comes... give me a ring.

763
00:55:16,424 --> 00:55:19,375
If I could find your neck, I'd wring it.

764
00:55:19,509 --> 00:55:23,420
Larita's making sheep's eyes at Philip.
- She's a Venus de Flytrap!

765
00:55:23,555 --> 00:55:27,679
She wants him all to herself.
- She's not interested in Philip.

766
00:55:27,809 --> 00:55:30,179
Nobody's interested in Philip.
- I am!

767
00:55:31,145 --> 00:55:32,887
Mount up, Larita.

768
00:55:33,021 --> 00:55:36,932
If you don't mind, I think
I might give the fox a head start.

769
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,982
Lari, get on the pony, please.

770
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,726
Oh, it's just as I thought...

771
00:55:42,864 --> 00:55:46,312
Oh, I said I'd ride,
and I'm always good for my word.

772
00:55:47,326 --> 00:55:48,570
Tally-ho!

773
00:56:04,508 --> 00:56:08,454
# Spy on me, baby, use satellite

774
00:56:08,596 --> 00:56:12,636
# Infrared to see me
move through the night

775
00:56:12,765 --> 00:56:16,261
# Aim, going to fire, shoot me right

776
00:56:16,393 --> 00:56:20,304
# I'm going to like the way you fight

777
00:56:20,439 --> 00:56:24,515
# Now you've found
the secret code I use

778
00:56:24,651 --> 00:56:28,479
# To wash away my lonely blues

779
00:56:28,613 --> 00:56:34,977
# So I can't deny or lie
cos you're the only one to make me fly

780
00:56:36,162 --> 00:56:40,452
# Sex bomb, sex bomb,
you're a sex bomb

781
00:56:40,582 --> 00:56:43,864
# You can give it to me
when I need to come along...

782
00:56:44,002 --> 00:56:46,408
What?

783
00:56:46,546 --> 00:56:48,833
# You're my sex bomb... #

784
00:56:48,965 --> 00:56:52,295
What is she doing?
- A victory lap, by the look of things.

785
00:56:53,344 --> 00:56:56,875
There's something wild about that child
that's so contagious.

786
00:57:00,308 --> 00:57:02,465
Whoo-hoo!

787
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:09,729
Well, she promised she'd ride.
Ha-ha!

788
00:57:18,991 --> 00:57:22,606
#... no chaperone
can get our number

789
00:57:22,744 --> 00:57:27,781
# The world's in a slumber,
let's misbehave!

790
00:57:27,917 --> 00:57:32,705
# There's something wild
about you, child, that's so contagious

791
00:57:32,838 --> 00:57:37,958
# Let's be outrageous,
let's misbehave!

792
00:57:38,092 --> 00:57:42,833
# When Adam won Eve's hand,
he wouldn't stand for teasin'

793
00:57:42,971 --> 00:57:47,794
# He didn't care about those apples
out of season

794
00:57:47,934 --> 00:57:52,840
# They say that Spring means
just one little thing to little lovebirds

795
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:58,562
# We're not above birds,
let's misbehave... #

796
00:58:04,867 --> 00:58:06,443
Whoo!

797
00:58:16,918 --> 00:58:19,585
Miss Hilda,
telephone from New York.

798
00:58:27,178 --> 00:58:28,670
Uncle George?

799
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:31,672
Oh, thank God, a friendly voice.

800
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:34,924
Yes, and she's a complete nightmare.

801
00:58:37,687 --> 00:58:39,678
Really?

802
00:58:39,814 --> 00:58:42,018
How salacious.

803
00:58:44,401 --> 00:58:46,273
Come in.

804
00:58:47,196 --> 00:58:48,653
Mother?

805
00:58:50,032 --> 00:58:53,279
I'd like to apologise
for today's schmozzle.

806
00:58:53,409 --> 00:58:55,696
That really won't be necessary.

807
00:58:55,828 --> 00:58:58,992
Larita made no secret
of her disapproval of blood sports.

808
00:58:59,123 --> 00:59:00,699
She did ride as promised.

809
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:06,284
Well, we should credit her with her
imaginative way of keeping her word.

810
00:59:06,422 --> 00:59:08,496
You must be very proud of her.

811
00:59:09,549 --> 00:59:12,120
Mother, I think...

812
00:59:12,259 --> 00:59:14,748
I think maybe Larita and I ought to go.

813
00:59:14,887 --> 00:59:17,091
Oh...

814
00:59:17,224 --> 00:59:19,842
Yes, I see. Very well.

815
00:59:19,976 --> 00:59:23,804
Feel free to drop in
whenever it takes your fancy.

816
00:59:23,937 --> 00:59:26,141
Off you go. Enjoy.
- Don't be like that.

817
00:59:26,272 --> 00:59:29,270
I'm sorry, dear,
wasn't Mummy being kind enough?

818
00:59:29,401 --> 00:59:31,889
Take these, they might get you
as far as Constantinople!

819
00:59:32,028 --> 00:59:34,694
And this... Casablanca.
- Mother, stop it!

820
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:36,694
No. You stop it!

821
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:40,149
Stop being so naïve!

822
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:49,529
The money's gone, John.

823
00:59:49,668 --> 00:59:51,623
Nothing left.

824
00:59:51,753 --> 00:59:54,953
The only thing standing
between this family and bankruptcy

825
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,579
are those surveyors in the back field.

826
00:59:59,344 --> 01:00:04,962
Lord Hurst is offering to buy 400 acres
to keep the bailiffs away.

827
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:11,016
It's your legacy, John Whittaker...
and I'm selling it.

828
01:00:15,609 --> 01:00:20,266
I had no idea.
- No... No, you don't.

829
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:29,366
You were supposed to take over
the estate, take your responsibilities.

830
01:00:29,496 --> 01:00:32,494
But you were unexpectedly
flagged down.

831
01:00:34,209 --> 01:00:37,290
I've been struggling for years
with a man who doesn't care,

832
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:39,624
waiting for you to step up to the mark.

833
01:00:42,133 --> 01:00:45,249
No. You just go.

834
01:00:45,385 --> 01:00:48,750
Go to Algiers
with your racing car driver.

835
01:00:48,889 --> 01:00:51,555
I'm too tired to care any more!

836
01:00:53,726 --> 01:00:57,423
It's not exactly surprising,
John. Look at the grounds.

837
01:00:57,563 --> 01:01:02,019
Your mother is being very practical.
- In what sense?

838
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:05,516
You're not coming back.
Your father moved out decades ago.

839
01:01:05,653 --> 01:01:09,647
Philip's not going to marry Hilda.
Nobody's going to marry Marion.

840
01:01:09,782 --> 01:01:13,823
Subdividing the land and selling
to a neighbour is an elegant solution.

841
01:01:13,953 --> 01:01:15,611
Somewhat harsh.

842
01:01:17,123 --> 01:01:19,825
I've had my fair share
of selling off my past,

843
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:24,082
and it is an auction of innocence
that's neither fun nor pretty,

844
01:01:24,212 --> 01:01:27,625
but it is realistic,
something your mother excels in.

845
01:01:27,756 --> 01:01:30,458
But it's my responsibility.

846
01:01:31,886 --> 01:01:35,049
Gracious, how can I have been so blind?

847
01:02:13,464 --> 01:02:16,877
Oh, winter hydrangeas!
How do you do it?

848
01:02:17,009 --> 01:02:21,797
It's a controlled mixture of passion,
persistence and horse manure.

849
01:02:24,516 --> 01:02:27,929
I was hoping to catch a glimpse
of the new bride.

850
01:02:28,061 --> 01:02:31,557
Ah! John's wife has
very fickle allergies.

851
01:02:31,689 --> 01:02:36,311
Allergies to what?
- Flowers, Emma. Can you believe it?

852
01:02:36,443 --> 01:02:39,607
That is a strange choice of bed fellow
for this neck of the woods.

853
01:02:39,738 --> 01:02:43,068
You'll just have to make do
with John and Sarah.

854
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,688
It'll be like old times.

855
01:02:45,826 --> 01:02:51,361
# When you're smiling,
the whole world smiles... #

856
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:55,364
Why the big Panda eyes?

857
01:02:57,213 --> 01:02:59,997
I've often meant to ask you something,
but I hadn't the courage.

858
01:03:00,131 --> 01:03:02,205
Well, don't then.

859
01:03:02,342 --> 01:03:06,631
Did you think I behaved like a cad,
marrying Larita without telling you?

860
01:03:06,761 --> 01:03:08,752
No, of course not.

861
01:03:08,889 --> 01:03:12,551
You took the opportunity and married
for love. I respect you for it.

862
01:03:12,684 --> 01:03:16,050
If we'd have married it would've been
for friendship and convenience.

863
01:03:16,187 --> 01:03:18,308
Would it?
- Yes!

864
01:03:18,439 --> 01:03:20,928
We knew one another far too well.

865
01:03:21,066 --> 01:03:27,015
I want my marriage to be thrilling,
romantic, with passionate love letters.

866
01:03:27,156 --> 01:03:30,817
I could've written you love letters.
- Well, you didn't, did you?

867
01:03:30,951 --> 01:03:33,025
I did love you all the same.

868
01:03:34,412 --> 01:03:35,821
John, stop it.

869
01:03:44,963 --> 01:03:47,961
He's very different
from the man I met in France.

870
01:03:49,342 --> 01:03:53,834
The boy. The same, sweet boy.

871
01:03:57,808 --> 01:04:02,347
Is it true what she says?
Are you really selling off the land?

872
01:04:03,938 --> 01:04:07,683
To be perfectly honest,
I haven't the faintest idea.

873
01:04:10,152 --> 01:04:12,936
But it's your home, it's your community.

874
01:04:14,156 --> 01:04:16,028
Doesn't that matter?

875
01:04:16,157 --> 01:04:17,733
No.

876
01:04:19,536 --> 01:04:21,657
You're a dark horse.

877
01:04:24,249 --> 01:04:29,155
Have you noticed how few men
of my age there are in this village?

878
01:04:29,295 --> 01:04:32,412
Fourteen years ago,
we all took the King's shilling.

879
01:04:32,547 --> 01:04:35,332
We all signed up together.

880
01:04:35,467 --> 01:04:40,420
My brother, friends, staff...

881
01:04:41,889 --> 01:04:46,630
All hunkered down in the front row
of The Great War.

882
01:04:47,978 --> 01:04:51,558
I thought they kept majors
safely behind desks?

883
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:53,976
Promotion for surviving.

884
01:04:55,818 --> 01:05:00,143
As captain, it was my job
to get them all out of the trenches.

885
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:04,440
Within the first four minutes
of our first charge...

886
01:05:06,578 --> 01:05:08,734
...20,000 men died.

887
01:05:14,127 --> 01:05:16,532
In Thorverton, down the road here...

888
01:05:17,672 --> 01:05:20,125
...they were stationed in Morocco.

889
01:05:21,049 --> 01:05:23,537
Their captain bought them all home.

890
01:05:29,473 --> 01:05:32,471
I didn't bring a single man back.

891
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:35,431
This whole village died.

892
01:05:36,396 --> 01:05:39,809
I think there's a glimmer
of life in you yet.

893
01:05:39,941 --> 01:05:44,764
Well, if there is, it has no time for
pet cemeteries and Japanese lanterns.

894
01:05:44,904 --> 01:05:48,352
Why did you come back?
- I had no choice.

895
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:56,028
Bonjour, Madame.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez?

896
01:06:04,922 --> 01:06:07,245
'She came for you? '

897
01:06:08,843 --> 01:06:10,252
Why the lie?

898
01:06:10,384 --> 01:06:13,916
She thought "wandering home"
sounded better.

899
01:06:16,558 --> 01:06:19,225
And to be perfectly frank,
I no longer cared.

900
01:06:24,774 --> 01:06:29,478
I hate new games. There are
too many balls, I can't sink anything.

901
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:33,686
Sink some gin, Sausage Fingers!
- I never, ever win.

902
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,814
Oh, well done!

903
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:45,570
Stop sucking it. Come and help.
Come on, Pops.

904
01:06:45,709 --> 01:06:49,039
All right, Missie,
hold your horses.

905
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:51,575
Right, clear the decks, puppies.

906
01:06:51,714 --> 01:06:53,539
May I?

907
01:07:00,889 --> 01:07:03,377
I was hoping to have a word.

908
01:07:03,516 --> 01:07:07,675
We're accentuating the positive today,
I don't have a mind for anything else.

909
01:07:07,811 --> 01:07:09,767
Of course... of course.

910
01:07:11,273 --> 01:07:13,939
I know you are
under considerable stress...

911
01:07:15,736 --> 01:07:17,608
Regarding what?

912
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,692
Lord Hurst's kind offer
to buy into your property.

913
01:07:22,825 --> 01:07:26,818
The realtor I'm dealing with in London
also specialises in subdivision.

914
01:07:26,955 --> 01:07:31,446
Perhaps he could help negotiate
a premium price.

915
01:07:31,583 --> 01:07:35,114
Thank you, but really this is
of no concern of yours.

916
01:07:35,253 --> 01:07:39,495
Of course it's a concern. I am a member
of this family now and I'd like to help.

917
01:07:39,633 --> 01:07:42,796
And this is your interpretation
of "help", is it?

918
01:07:42,927 --> 01:07:46,293
Carving up our heritage and selling
it off to the highest bidder?

919
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:49,000
Coming from a country no older
than the chair you are sitting in,

920
01:07:49,141 --> 01:07:51,178
it seems a very practical solution.

921
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:53,928
Just forget the seven
generations of people

922
01:07:54,062 --> 01:07:57,806
who have devoted their entire lives
to farming this land.

923
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:01,103
Get someone else to do it.
With a machine, no less.

924
01:08:02,152 --> 01:08:04,226
Who do you think you are?

925
01:08:05,447 --> 01:08:09,227
Swinging your wherewithal
like a cat on heat.

926
01:08:10,701 --> 01:08:14,197
If you really want to be
of assistance, Larita,

927
01:08:14,330 --> 01:08:16,901
I think you know what's required.

928
01:08:19,042 --> 01:08:21,080
Right...

929
01:08:21,211 --> 01:08:25,039
I think it's time an expert showed you
how this game is played.

930
01:08:25,173 --> 01:08:27,163
Watch it...

931
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,757
Bravo!

932
01:08:30,178 --> 01:08:34,124
What a sportswoman, I must say.
Can you imagine? Fantastic!

933
01:08:36,308 --> 01:08:38,382
'Lari, you're confusing me.'

934
01:08:38,518 --> 01:08:41,516
'I'm feeling trapped.'
- 'I don't understand.'

935
01:08:41,646 --> 01:08:44,810
It's this house!
It has an air of doom hanging over it.

936
01:08:44,941 --> 01:08:48,058
And I can barely stand the weight
much longer.

937
01:08:53,741 --> 01:08:56,608
The answer is to go abroad again.

938
01:08:56,743 --> 01:09:01,317
Not yet. This is my life for now,
you know that.

939
01:09:01,455 --> 01:09:04,702
And what part do I play in it?
- Do you have to be so loud?

940
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:07,618
Of course I do! I'm American.

941
01:09:13,383 --> 01:09:18,005
What is the use of bickering like this?
It doesn't lead anywhere.

942
01:09:18,137 --> 01:09:21,088
You never know.
It might lead to a natural end.

943
01:09:22,724 --> 01:09:24,844
Do you want it to?

944
01:09:25,977 --> 01:09:28,216
Do you?

945
01:09:28,355 --> 01:09:29,812
No!

946
01:09:30,648 --> 01:09:33,765
I just want some peace and quiet.

947
01:09:33,901 --> 01:09:36,686
You're far too young
to make a remark like that.

948
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:38,894
I can't help my age...

949
01:09:40,198 --> 01:09:42,106
...Grandma.

950
01:09:44,994 --> 01:09:50,529
Look, I'm sorry that I leave you alone
so much. Honestly, I'm sorry.

951
01:09:53,043 --> 01:09:56,539
Good. Then let's do something about it.

952
01:10:01,926 --> 01:10:04,379
Why are we driving so fast?

953
01:10:04,511 --> 01:10:06,585
The thrill of escape!

954
01:10:11,519 --> 01:10:14,931
You're looking very game today.
Fairest game in the land.

955
01:10:16,481 --> 01:10:18,139
A penny for your thoughts?

956
01:10:18,275 --> 01:10:20,977
It's more than pennies,
I'm afraid, Pinkie.

957
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:23,563
I don't think I can afford the party
this year.

958
01:10:23,695 --> 01:10:26,314
But the Japanese lanterns!
- No, cancelled.

959
01:10:26,449 --> 01:10:29,316
Had to choose,
Japanese lanterns or the maid.

960
01:10:29,451 --> 01:10:34,688
You're not getting out of it that easily.
My offer of cellar and staff still stands.

961
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:38,362
It wouldn't be Christmas
without your knees-up.

962
01:10:48,885 --> 01:10:54,384
Oh! This is the first piece of clarity
I've had since arriving. Whoo!

963
01:10:58,019 --> 01:11:01,680
Why can't we live in moments
like these forever?

964
01:11:01,813 --> 01:11:03,684
Why?

965
01:11:03,815 --> 01:11:07,180
Because you've stopped
loving me, my darling!

966
01:11:07,318 --> 01:11:09,355
How can you say that?

967
01:11:09,487 --> 01:11:12,485
Oh, I just open my mouth
and the words come out.

968
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,611
Then let's make a fresh start.

969
01:11:31,006 --> 01:11:35,912
There are so many things I need
to tell you about me. Hard things.

970
01:11:36,053 --> 01:11:37,842
I don't care.

971
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:39,842
I do.

972
01:11:39,972 --> 01:11:44,345
It doesn't matter.
I trust you absolutely.

973
01:11:44,811 --> 01:11:54,434
# I'll see you again
whenever Spring breaks through again...

974
01:11:54,569 --> 01:11:55,848
Come on.

975
01:11:56,696 --> 01:12:00,986
# Time may lie heavy between

976
01:12:01,826 --> 01:12:08,736
# But what has been
is past forgetting

977
01:12:08,874 --> 01:12:13,863
# This sweet memory

978
01:12:14,003 --> 01:12:20,450
# Throughout my life will come to me

979
01:12:20,592 --> 01:12:25,084
# Though the world may go awry... #

980
01:12:27,599 --> 01:12:28,842
Shot!

981
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,397
John!

982
01:12:42,069 --> 01:12:45,399
Top hole.
- Oh!

983
01:12:45,532 --> 01:12:48,778
I can't decide which is worse,
that you had to sneak outside

984
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:51,694
to get some privacy,
or that you were caught by Veronica.

985
01:12:51,828 --> 01:12:53,653
Who's Veronica?

986
01:12:53,789 --> 01:12:56,028
I am. It's my name.

987
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:02,706
I fail to see the humour in it!
- No, darling, you're quite right.

988
01:13:02,839 --> 01:13:06,204
I can certainly see the serious
implications. It's not a laughing matter.

989
01:13:06,342 --> 01:13:08,213
It's only a laughing matter.

990
01:13:08,344 --> 01:13:12,207
Indecent exposure is illegal.
Even in America.

991
01:13:12,347 --> 01:13:14,421
Yep, yep...

992
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:17,128
You're right.
And we're very, very sorry, aren't we?

993
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:21,557
No, I'm not. This is my husband.
- And this is my home!

994
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:24,178
Maybe it's time for them
to fly the nest?

995
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:28,180
Certainly not. They will stay put
and brazen this out.

996
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:31,317
And you can get that ghastly painting
out of my house!

997
01:13:31,448 --> 01:13:34,316
We do not need any more reminders
of your easy virtue!

998
01:13:44,626 --> 01:13:47,162
Excited, Furber?
- Overwhelmed, sir.

999
01:13:47,295 --> 01:13:51,869
Miss Hilda...
- Uncle George... How explosive!

1000
01:13:52,007 --> 01:13:54,710
Furber, I recognise that as asparagus.

1001
01:13:54,844 --> 01:13:56,716
Correct, Madam.

1002
01:13:56,846 --> 01:14:00,425
Ha! I pity poor Panda.
- Oh, what is it now?

1003
01:14:00,557 --> 01:14:05,713
Read! "The Detroit News".
Uncle George is a super sleuth!

1004
01:14:05,854 --> 01:14:09,267
Collecting old newspapers is
the last refuge of a truly boring man.

1005
01:14:09,398 --> 01:14:13,522
Boring? Far from it. It was a scandal!

1006
01:14:13,652 --> 01:14:16,354
Wasn't it... Mrs Morley?

1007
01:14:17,655 --> 01:14:20,772
Mrs Tom Morley of Detroit, Michigan.

1008
01:14:20,908 --> 01:14:23,112
Don't be grotesque, Hilda.

1009
01:14:23,244 --> 01:14:27,736
Well, I suppose I'd better finish
my meal before it wilts entirely.

1010
01:14:27,872 --> 01:14:30,326
Any dressing?
- Oh, I am genuinely shocked!

1011
01:14:30,459 --> 01:14:34,156
No thanks, I always end up wearing it.
- We've been hoodwinked!

1012
01:14:34,296 --> 01:14:36,702
Especially that runny vinaigrette.
- Fire and brimstone!

1013
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:38,794
Mayonnaise has more ballast.

1014
01:14:38,924 --> 01:14:42,290
Will you stop this insulting behaviour
immediately?

1015
01:14:48,058 --> 01:14:50,178
Oh, I always hated that photo of myself.

1016
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:54,386
Of everything I ever
expected, nothing prepared me for this.

1017
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:57,190
For what?
- She was charged with murder.

1018
01:14:57,316 --> 01:14:59,804
I was acquitted.
- And that's consolation?

1019
01:14:59,944 --> 01:15:03,392
I told you my husband died.
- But you didn't tell us how, did you?

1020
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:05,521
Does John know about this?

1021
01:15:05,657 --> 01:15:07,980
I see...
- It's no concern of ours.

1022
01:15:08,118 --> 01:15:10,736
Father! Really!

1023
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:13,737
Yes, and after Hilda went
to all that trouble digging it up.

1024
01:15:13,873 --> 01:15:16,326
I'm going outside for a cigarette.
Care to join me?

1025
01:15:16,459 --> 01:15:19,374
Thank you, Jim. Don't mind if I do.

1026
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:22,836
No concern?

1027
01:15:28,178 --> 01:15:30,252
The pack's closing.

1028
01:15:30,388 --> 01:15:33,552
This woman has taken advantage
of our son!

1029
01:15:33,683 --> 01:15:35,720
He'd never have married her
if he'd known.

1030
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:38,718
You know that, do you?
- You'd have preferred we had an affair?

1031
01:15:38,854 --> 01:15:41,935
It would've been more appropriate!
- Mother!

1032
01:15:42,065 --> 01:15:46,141
Unfortunately, I agree with you!
- It's easy to talk like this now.

1033
01:15:46,276 --> 01:15:50,352
It isn't easy, it's heartbreaking.
I love John, but it's not blind love.

1034
01:15:51,866 --> 01:15:54,817
Marion, does that sound
indicate contempt or asthma?

1035
01:15:54,951 --> 01:15:57,274
You can't palm us off like that,
Mrs Morley.

1036
01:15:57,412 --> 01:15:59,486
This is your doing.
You're a bigger fool than you look.

1037
01:15:59,623 --> 01:16:01,697
Larita is your type,
isn't she, Father?

1038
01:16:01,832 --> 01:16:04,368
That is the nicest thing
any of you have ever said.

1039
01:16:04,501 --> 01:16:07,036
Hello, are we having a picnic?

1040
01:16:08,713 --> 01:16:14,378
John... I think your wife better unveil
this one herself. Don't you, Larita?

1041
01:16:18,098 --> 01:16:19,638
Before we met...

1042
01:16:20,725 --> 01:16:24,849
...I was involved in a court case
over the death of my husband.

1043
01:16:24,979 --> 01:16:27,302
It was seedy and stressful,

1044
01:16:27,439 --> 01:16:30,354
but since I was found innocent

1045
01:16:30,483 --> 01:16:33,600
I didn't think it necessary
to burden you with the details.

1046
01:16:33,736 --> 01:16:35,015
Innocent?

1047
01:16:35,154 --> 01:16:38,068
She was responsible
for a man killing himself!

1048
01:16:38,198 --> 01:16:41,813
The verdict was suicide
but that's not where it started.

1049
01:16:41,951 --> 01:16:43,741
I thought it was cancer.

1050
01:16:44,412 --> 01:16:46,035
It was...

1051
01:16:46,164 --> 01:16:48,699
But he was so desperately sick.

1052
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:52,033
If you'd known him, you would've
understood how forgivable it was.

1053
01:16:52,169 --> 01:16:54,622
It's not as if she poisoned him.
- That's what everyone thinks.

1054
01:16:54,755 --> 01:16:57,161
She's a black widow.
- I pity you, Marion.

1055
01:16:57,298 --> 01:16:59,502
Really? Well, I won't let you!

1056
01:16:59,634 --> 01:17:04,007
Right, that's it! You have a dance
to organise, I suggest you all get to it!

1057
01:17:04,138 --> 01:17:05,797
Now!

1058
01:17:09,727 --> 01:17:12,298
Hilda! Come on, inside!

1059
01:17:14,648 --> 01:17:16,473
John...

1060
01:17:41,922 --> 01:17:45,039
Are you crying
because you're angry or ashamed?

1061
01:17:47,176 --> 01:17:48,669
Neither.

1062
01:17:50,347 --> 01:17:54,803
Coming here has been the most
demoralising experience of my life.

1063
01:18:00,022 --> 01:18:03,103
Why didn't you tell me?

1064
01:18:03,233 --> 01:18:05,769
I wanted to,
everything just happened so fast.

1065
01:18:05,902 --> 01:18:08,058
That's not good enough.

1066
01:18:09,405 --> 01:18:12,273
I tried to, several times.

1067
01:18:14,077 --> 01:18:17,987
But you trusted me..."absolutely".

1068
01:18:19,999 --> 01:18:23,945
And you saw the field day
those fatuous hypocrites made of it.

1069
01:18:24,086 --> 01:18:26,077
Please remember they're my family.

1070
01:18:26,212 --> 01:18:28,783
I shouldn't think of them at all
if they weren't.

1071
01:18:28,922 --> 01:18:33,248
Still... you should have told me.

1072
01:18:34,844 --> 01:18:36,918
You should have loved me more.

1073
01:18:39,015 --> 01:18:41,171
I couldn't love you any more.

1074
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:43,881
You should have loved me better.

1075
01:18:47,023 --> 01:18:49,310
I don't understand you, Larita.

1076
01:18:51,401 --> 01:18:53,937
I don't understand you at all.

1077
01:19:15,256 --> 01:19:19,712
1... 2... 3... Are you all left feet?

1078
01:19:19,843 --> 01:19:23,920
Dancing with you
is like trying to move a piano.

1079
01:19:24,056 --> 01:19:26,426
I wonder what the American
will be wearing.

1080
01:19:26,558 --> 01:19:28,798
Or who she'll be poisoning!

1081
01:19:31,604 --> 01:19:35,016
Do you like long, moonlit walks?

1082
01:19:35,149 --> 01:19:37,720
Only when taken by people
who annoy me.

1083
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:41,854
You've got me all to yourself.
Larita's upstairs with a headache.

1084
01:19:41,988 --> 01:19:45,318
And which little fool, pray tell,
gave her that?

1085
01:20:02,591 --> 01:20:06,170
You ought to see if Larita is coping.
- I already have. She's fine.

1086
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:09,917
It's been a very trying day
for her, John.

1087
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:13,053
Go and escort your wife down.
- No, I wouldn't worry.

1088
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:16,963
You know my wife, she'll make
an entrance when she's ready.

1089
01:20:22,066 --> 01:20:23,891
Come in.

1090
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:29,604
Quickly, you'll blow my cover.

1091
01:20:37,496 --> 01:20:40,115
Why are you sitting in the dark?

1092
01:20:40,249 --> 01:20:42,205
Watching.

1093
01:20:43,794 --> 01:20:46,958
People are so universally similar
when their guard is down.

1094
01:20:47,088 --> 01:20:50,370
Oh, hello! Ha-ha!

1095
01:20:53,512 --> 01:20:57,671
It seems they are universally similar
when their guard is up, as well.

1096
01:21:00,726 --> 01:21:02,183
May I?

1097
01:21:04,229 --> 01:21:08,519
Thank you for being gallant today.
- You are damn cool in a crisis.

1098
01:21:09,943 --> 01:21:13,143
The judge at my trial
said something similar.

1099
01:21:15,322 --> 01:21:17,478
Why did you do it?

1100
01:21:20,034 --> 01:21:22,487
Why did you marry John?

1101
01:21:24,038 --> 01:21:27,700
My first husband was older,
and his end was messy.

1102
01:21:29,752 --> 01:21:31,956
Long afterwards, this...

1103
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:34,915
...boy...

1104
01:21:35,048 --> 01:21:40,204
...this pure boy arrived
fresh and unblemished.

1105
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:46,843
I married him because
any other relationship seemed...

1106
01:21:47,726 --> 01:21:50,511
...cheap and squalid.

1107
01:21:52,314 --> 01:21:56,805
My first marriage cost me my youth,
and here I am stealing someone else's.

1108
01:21:58,861 --> 01:22:00,520
What will you do?

1109
01:22:02,615 --> 01:22:04,819
The best I can.

1110
01:22:10,873 --> 01:22:12,152
Oh, Davis, thank you.

1111
01:22:13,916 --> 01:22:17,080
And thank you, Pinkie.
- No, not at all, my dear.

1112
01:22:17,211 --> 01:22:19,830
Just look at this turnout.
- Hmm...

1113
01:22:19,963 --> 01:22:24,621
They've only come for a repeat
performance of the Cincinnati succubus.

1114
01:22:24,759 --> 01:22:27,129
May I have the pleasure?

1115
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:02,239
Oh, look!

1116
01:23:21,435 --> 01:23:24,848
Tango, please.
- Certainly. Tango...

1117
01:23:32,779 --> 01:23:35,528
Dance with me, John.

1118
01:23:37,033 --> 01:23:39,189
Lari, don't.

1119
01:23:39,326 --> 01:23:42,774
Please? Dance with me.

1120
01:24:24,742 --> 01:24:27,231
That was very gallant.

1121
01:25:18,457 --> 01:25:21,574
You've got to stop them, Mother.
- No, I don't.

1122
01:26:00,495 --> 01:26:03,612
Oh, marvellous! Marvellous!

1123
01:26:05,416 --> 01:26:08,698
Straight from the bordellos
of Buenos Aires

1124
01:26:08,835 --> 01:26:12,201
to the Hippodrome of London, Maestro,
take it away!

1125
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:17,171
Jim, this is the end.

1126
01:26:28,061 --> 01:26:29,968
Congratulations, Madam.

1127
01:26:30,104 --> 01:26:33,849
Have you been drinking, Furber?
- Yes, Madam. Prodigiously.

1128
01:26:33,983 --> 01:26:36,685
You are full of surprises.
- Oh, yes, Madam.

1129
01:26:36,819 --> 01:26:38,893
I was even arrested once.

1130
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:40,937
What for?
- Bigamy.

1131
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:52,369
Ah, there you are,
Pinkie, I've found you.

1132
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:05,297
Larita, where are you going?

1133
01:27:05,428 --> 01:27:08,296
Away, Sarah. For John's sake.

1134
01:27:08,431 --> 01:27:10,173
Far, far away.

1135
01:27:11,308 --> 01:27:13,429
Is there anything I can do?

1136
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,930
You can look after him.

1137
01:27:16,062 --> 01:27:19,724
Women like me are tiresome in love.
We expect too much.

1138
01:27:21,609 --> 01:27:25,389
Marry John. It's the way things
always should've been.

1139
01:27:25,529 --> 01:27:30,233
I'm just so sorry I got in the way.
- You love him that much?

1140
01:27:36,789 --> 01:27:39,242
Go. I'll cover for you.

1141
01:27:39,375 --> 01:27:41,082
Sweet Sarah.

1142
01:27:41,210 --> 01:27:44,457
So glad you've recovered
from your headache.

1143
01:27:44,588 --> 01:27:47,539
Please don't build any convenient
social lies on my behalf.

1144
01:27:47,673 --> 01:27:52,247
I say, Mother is only...
- Fighting to keep the charade alive?

1145
01:27:52,387 --> 01:27:55,752
You've shown tremendous fortitude
holding this family together, Veronica,

1146
01:27:55,890 --> 01:27:57,679
and I can respect that.

1147
01:27:57,808 --> 01:28:02,513
What I can't respect is the manipulative
road you've chosen to maintain control.

1148
01:28:02,645 --> 01:28:05,927
This war is over. Move on.

1149
01:28:06,066 --> 01:28:08,601
"Move on." Oh, how convenient.

1150
01:28:08,734 --> 01:28:13,107
Oh, wake up, Marion.
Edgar's not coming back.

1151
01:28:13,238 --> 01:28:15,359
And that ring isn't stuck, you are.

1152
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:20,112
And Hilda, you've got such promise,
yet you're squandering it on malice.

1153
01:28:20,245 --> 01:28:22,152
My advice to both you girls?

1154
01:28:23,081 --> 01:28:26,945
Run! Go see the world
through your own eyes.

1155
01:28:28,586 --> 01:28:32,165
So speaks the siren,
leading the sailors to their death.

1156
01:28:32,297 --> 01:28:35,544
At least I'm not Medusa,
turning them to stone.

1157
01:28:35,675 --> 01:28:39,800
Get out!
- Larita? Lari?

1158
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:43,631
Lari, don't go.
- John, I have to.

1159
01:28:43,766 --> 01:28:47,214
I can't live here. Nothing can.

1160
01:28:47,352 --> 01:28:50,884
But you're my wife, and I love you.

1161
01:28:52,274 --> 01:28:54,348
Oh, John, my darling...

1162
01:28:56,487 --> 01:28:59,105
You don't know what love is.

1163
01:28:59,239 --> 01:29:03,564
You have no idea what it means
to love someone so much

1164
01:29:03,701 --> 01:29:06,403
that you will do anything for them.

1165
01:29:10,249 --> 01:29:12,916
Even inject them with poison

1166
01:29:13,042 --> 01:29:16,573
when they were too feeble
to do it for themselves.

1167
01:29:22,258 --> 01:29:25,540
I don't believe that you could've
ever loved me like that.

1168
01:29:34,228 --> 01:29:36,053
Oh, John, let her go.

1169
01:29:38,858 --> 01:29:44,439
Let her go, off into the sunset
to inject another family with her poison!

1170
01:29:44,571 --> 01:29:46,562
Mother...
Off you go!

1171
01:29:46,697 --> 01:29:49,067
Before your past
catches up with you... again!

1172
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:50,905
Mother!

1173
01:29:53,453 --> 01:29:55,776
Oh, you evil...

1174
01:29:55,914 --> 01:29:58,070
Mother! Shut up!

1175
01:30:01,335 --> 01:30:03,824
They are predicting warmer weather,
Madam.

1176
01:30:03,962 --> 01:30:07,079
Yes, Furber, I believe they are.
Thank you.

1177
01:30:12,304 --> 01:30:13,761
Very generous.

1178
01:30:15,056 --> 01:30:18,303
There's something special in there
for Jackson. Make sure he gets it.

1179
01:30:18,434 --> 01:30:21,349
Of course.
Where will Madam be staying?

1180
01:30:22,396 --> 01:30:23,853
Who knows?

1181
01:30:24,606 --> 01:30:26,147
Good luck.

1182
01:30:27,401 --> 01:30:29,142
And you, Furber.

1183
01:30:30,111 --> 01:30:32,682
Would you forward the painting please,
Furber?

1184
01:30:32,822 --> 01:30:35,109
To where, sir?

1185
01:30:41,497 --> 01:30:44,448
I shall enjoy passing on
the good news, sir.

1186
01:30:48,462 --> 01:30:54,245
Well, my dear, when the going
gets tough, the tough get going.

1187
01:30:54,383 --> 01:30:58,626
# I've got something to tell you
Really?

1188
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:02,762
# I got something to say
I'm all ears.

1189
01:31:02,891 --> 01:31:07,678
# I'm going to put
these wheels in motion

1190
01:31:07,811 --> 01:31:11,426
# And let nothing stand in my way...

1191
01:31:13,108 --> 01:31:17,517
# Darling,
I'll climb any mountain

1192
01:31:17,654 --> 01:31:21,482
# Darling, I'll do anything

1193
01:31:21,616 --> 01:31:24,318
# When the going gets tough

1194
01:31:26,454 --> 01:31:29,238
# The tough get going

1195
01:31:30,791 --> 01:31:33,825
# When the going gets rough

1196
01:31:35,587 --> 01:31:38,122
# The tough get rough

1197
01:31:40,258 --> 01:31:43,505
# Gonna get myself across the river

1198
01:31:44,469 --> 01:31:48,333
# That's the price that I'm willing to pay

1199
01:31:48,473 --> 01:31:53,177
# I'm gonna make you stand and deliver

1200
01:31:53,312 --> 01:31:57,720
# And give me love
in that old-fashioned way

1201
01:31:57,857 --> 01:32:02,977
# Oh, darling,
I'll climb any mountain

1202
01:32:03,111 --> 01:32:06,892
# Darling, I'll do anything

1203
01:32:07,032 --> 01:32:09,734
# Cos when the going gets tough

1204
01:32:11,828 --> 01:32:14,577
# The tough get going

1205
01:32:15,914 --> 01:32:19,114
# When the going gets rough

1206
01:32:20,918 --> 01:32:23,407
# The tough get rough...

1207
01:32:46,735 --> 01:32:51,641
