1
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,130
Oh, I don't know.

2
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,050
Something.. - Then, this is the
one that we kept on one side.

3
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,930
I wonder, if he is
that absolutely.. - I mean

4
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,010
absolutely different, you know.
- This is the veil.

5
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,680
With the embroidery..
- Yes, I like it too.

6
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,300
How are you, darling?

7
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,880
Nice to meet you..
- My daughter's mother-in-law.

8
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,510
Go! One, two, three, four..

9
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,220
And turn and go!

10
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,050
Smile, mama.
Smile, mummy.

11
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,340
I think this
will go with this one.

12
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,130
Right..
- Okay, let's ask.

13
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,720
Come on, come on,
I'll get you the reflection.

14
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,680
Like it?
- That's nice.

15
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,800
I think that's beautiful.
- This is yours.

16
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,380
"The bride's anklets
are so pretty.."

17
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,970
"The bride's veil is so pretty."

18
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,800
"The bride's veil is so pretty."

19
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,180
"The bride's earrings
are so pretty."

20
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,630
Right. Do it properly.

21
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,090
Remove all the extra flowers.

22
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,680
Mister, cover them
with flowers.

23
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,340
Okay?

24
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,090
Like I told you earlier.

25
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,970
Bye!

26
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,930
Let's go..

27
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,430
What's the urgency?

28
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,220
We have the rest of our lives.

29
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,590
We've been asked not to meet
for a few days..

30
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
Let's go.

31
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,050
I think you should return.
No one has seen us yet.

32
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,930
Vinay, I want to breathe.
Wedding traditions..

33
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,510
Welcome! The costumes,
the jewelry, etcetera..

34
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,930
Please let's get
away for a while.

35
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,970
Just for an hour.
- An hour?

36
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,510
Start the car. - 15 minutes.
- Let's go.

37
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,760
15 minutes! That's it.
- Let's go.

38
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,430
Thank you.

39
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,930
Five minutes to go.

40
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,680
The time hasn't started yet.

41
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,590
Let's escape
these bright lights.

42
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,970
Out in the open.

43
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,050
To the highway?
- Without bodyguards?

44
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,010
Just a glimpse
of the highway. Okay? Promise.

45
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,510
Veera, you're being..
- Please.. Vinay, please.

46
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,930
Okay.

47
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,510
It's working.

48
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,050
All the knots in my brain
are untying.

49
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,760
Good. Let's head back.

50
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,050
Some untying left.
Little more.

51
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,970
A little longer
has become a lot longer.

52
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,720
So?
Little more.

53
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,760
Veera, it isn't safe here.

54
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,430
You're here.

55
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,430
Vinay..

56
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,380
Let's not go back.
Let's run away.

57
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,090
Very funny.
- Yes! Let's make a run for it.

58
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,720
And build a beautiful home
on some mountain top.

59
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,050
You can be a shepherd.
I can cook.

60
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,630
It'll be great fun.

61
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,090
Okay. I'm turning back.
- Okay.. No!

62
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,930
Sorry, sorry.
- Enough!

63
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,720
No, Vinay, little more.
Vinay, please.

64
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,090
We should've turned back
much earlier.

65
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,470
Is it closed?

66
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,680
Veera.. Veera, sit!

67
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,050
Veera, get back in the car.

68
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,840
See!

69
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,300
The air is so different here.
So fresh.

70
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,590
Veera, come back.

71
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,050
Breathing the city air
makes you restless.

72
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,760
Why can't it be like this?

73
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,630
If you've had your fun,
come back.

74
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,590
Come out for a second!
- Veera, hurry.

75
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,470
Just for one second, Vinay.
Please!

76
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
He's coming from behind.
Run!

77
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,550
Hey, you scum!

78
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,050
Stop! Stop, I say!

79
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,760
Stand right there.
- Hurry!

80
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,380
Constable!
- You..

81
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,840
Vinay.

82
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,510
Get in the car.
- Vinay!

83
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,930
I had told you..
I had told you. - Vinay!

84
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Get out! Open the door.

85
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,800
Take the car. Get in!

86
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,130
Don't you dare!
- Get in.

87
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,300
Stay there. Or I'll shoot!

88
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,720
Let's move!

89
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,090
Do you have a vehicle?
Where are you?

90
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,430
Where do we have to go?

91
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,090
Can you see the road
at the back?

92
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,130
Drive along that.
I'll tell you.

93
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,970
Tell me.
- 300.

94
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,590
Take the road
behind the mountain.

95
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,800
No! No..

96
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,470
Let go!
- No!

97
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,430
Let her go.

98
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,880
Open the back door.
Get in there.

99
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,630
Tie her hands.

100
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,130
Your name?

101
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,470
What's your name?

102
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,550
I want to go home. Please..

103
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,470
Name?
- Please..

104
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,970
Please.
- Stop!

105
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,550
Speak up!

106
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,180
Veera
- Veera what?

107
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,340
Tripathi.

108
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,630
Are you done?
Come on.

109
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,760
Manik Tripathi's daughter?

110
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,130
I told you a thousand times.
Stay away from the rich.

111
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,930
Don't mess with them.

112
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,840
They're linked to big shots.

113
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,840
They'll skin you alive
if you mess with them.

114
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,930
Now deal with it.

115
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,550
He didn't know who she is.

116
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,510
Who travels in a flashy Audi?
Tell me.

117
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,630
Tripathi's daughter.
- Yes!

118
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,130
Tripathi's daughter.

119
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,260
The police, the home guard.
BSF, the army..

120
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,760
They'll enter your behind
and exit through your mouth.

121
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,760
Now save your honor.

122
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,130
A man should know his place.

123
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,470
Why climb a mountain
if you don't have the guts?

124
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,880
What are you staring at?

125
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,220
What will you do? Eat me up?

126
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,050
You're scared witless.

127
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,430
Pair of eunuchs!

128
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,260
Bhaati!

129
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,130
You shouldn't have said that.

130
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,630
I won't forget this.

131
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,720
No, I won't, Bhaati.

132
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,510
Or should I fix you right now?

133
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,380
I swear..
Put that away! - Hello.

134
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,430
Easy.
- Don't stop me.

135
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,880
Stay away from the rich.

136
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,180
Fear them!
- Not a word more.

137
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,880
Why should we fear the rich?

138
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,180
Salute them.

139
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,550
Open doors for them. Why?

140
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,470
Because they can take your life
whenever they want.

141
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,090
They've got it all.
What's left?

142
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,510
We're used to licking
their soles.

143
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,510
Enjoy getting harassed now.

144
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,090
You mother..

145
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,630
Let's go.

146
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,220
Sit!

147
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,550
You're talking
about Manik Tripathi.

148
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,930
He owns factories
around the world.

149
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,970
Ministers and politicians are
his mates. Must we take them on?

150
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,300
What will you do?

151
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,880
What now?

152
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,760
Call him up.

153
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,090
Hello, Mr. Tripathi.

154
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,260
You know what? Your daughter
is in our custody.

155
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,760
I am messaging you an address.

156
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,840
Come there with the ransom,
please.

157
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,220
Yes.

158
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,550
That's just what I'll say.

159
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,220
And when the girl gets shot
in the leg

160
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,510
Tripathi will come running
with the cash.

161
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:08,970
Or I'll sell her off to a
brothel. In some shady street.

162
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,970
Vanished. India is too big.

163
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,090
A bad omen is shadowing him.

164
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,260
He'll land us in trouble too.

165
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,970
You'll die
a dog's death, Bhaati.

166
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:21,680
A dog always dies
a dog's death.

167
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,840
What'll they do to me?

168
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,880
Hang me four times?

169
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,840
I've murdered three men already.

170
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,720
I'll die as I lived.

171
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,430
But this will happen for sure.

172
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,590
I will do it.

173
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,720
Listen.

174
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,630
Wake up!

175
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,720
I am Gaurav.

176
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,880
Don't be scared.

177
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,380
They call me Goru.

178
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,590
I'll take care of you.

179
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,630
No.

180
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,930
I'll talk to you later.

181
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,630
We have to go now.
It's too risky here.

182
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,760
Get up. Now!

183
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,510
I don't trust
any of you anyway.

184
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,380
So, do what you have to do.

185
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,760
Let's go.

186
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,010
Switch off your phones.

187
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,630
Their woman is in our hands.

188
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,090
Today is our day.

189
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:54,130
Hail Kishan Das!
- Hail him!

190
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,050
Yes!

191
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,760
Hail Lord Lakkad!
- Hail him!

192
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,340
Yes!

193
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,680
Hail our villages.
- Hail our land!

194
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,590
Hail the Lord!

195
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,130
Any new 'qawali'
out in the market?

196
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,510
Listen.

197
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,970
People don't like listening
to new 'qawali'.

198
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,550
A special recitation.

199
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,380
In honor
of Khwaja Gharib Nawaz.

200
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,880
Is it old?
- Very old.

201
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,840
Then it's fine.

202
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,680
Hello.
- Hello.

203
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:01,220
Pal, you've outdone yourself!

204
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,880
Your name will spread
far and wide.

205
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,930
Couldn't you talk on the phone?

206
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,180
I heard today.
Tried calling you.

207
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,090
Where will you hide us?

208
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,680
Things have changed.

209
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,180
You're famous now.

210
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,470
Wherever you go with the girl,
all Ajmer Sharif will know

211
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,340
and we'll all become famous.
So, you can't stay here.

212
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,220
Is it on the news?

213
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,090
Not yet.

214
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,590
Everyone knows because
of the damn police.

215
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,630
My God!

216
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,760
You have M.K. Tripathi's
daughter. Imagine!

217
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,260
It's me.

218
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,010
Are you unwell?

219
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,590
Your lips must be numb.

220
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,760
I'm on your side.

221
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,380
Make sure you never talk
to anyone about me.

222
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,930
They're dangerous people.

223
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,970
Who knows
what they'll do to you?

224
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,840
You couldn't even imagine it.

225
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,430
But I am here.

226
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,550
I'll take care of you.

227
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,680
I'll take care of you.

228
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
I really will.

229
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,130
You want to go home, don't you?

230
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,760
You want to go home, don't you?

231
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,010
Back to your parents?

232
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,590
To your family?

233
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,300
You want to return, right?

234
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,180
I'll take you back.

235
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:34,180
You're back.
Let's give her some water.

236
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,470
We'll feed her later.

237
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,380
There's Aadoo.

238
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:43,050
We're over there. Okay.
- Sit down.

239
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,840
Out. Hey, Aadoo

240
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,470
Hurry up!

241
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,930
Check the corners.

242
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,590
All clear?
- All clear.

243
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,180
Come on.

244
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,970
Sorry! Sorry, please!

245
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,340
Please!

246
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,300
Please..

247
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,970
Please!

248
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,590
I'm sorry! Please..
- What is it?

249
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,630
She wants to run.
- So?

250
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,340
Run!

251
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,050
Well?

252
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,430
Run.

253
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,050
Hey!

254
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,630
"Where are You?"

255
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:42,090
"Where am I?"

256
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:48,800
"Where are You? Where am I?"

257
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:55,260
"Where are You? Where am I?"

258
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,630
"O Lord, show compassion to me."

259
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:06,180
"Countless sorrows surround me."

260
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:13,380
"I believe that You will restore
my world."

261
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:17,510
"Hear the one who has no one."

262
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:24,840
"Where are You? Where am I?"

263
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:30,220
"Where are You? Where am I?"

264
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,880
"Where are You? Where am I?"

265
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:43,050
"Where are You? Where am I?"

266
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:49,010
"How fearsome
is the path before me!"

267
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:54,050
"Why have You
turned away from me?"

268
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:09,550
"Where am I?"

269
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,340
"Where am I?"

270
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:16,130
"Darkness descends around me."

271
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,130
"No light to be seen."

272
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:25,050
"Body broken, soul defeated."

273
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,970
"The stars of good fortune
have faded."

274
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,050
"Show a ray of hope."

275
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:37,260
"There's nothingness
everywhere."

276
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,550
Get back!

277
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,470
She ran away of her own accord.
She'll return in the same way.

278
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,130
Move!

279
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,300
No tea for me?

280
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,300
I'm making cottage cheese curry.
Will you eat it?

281
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,220
We need SIM cards.

282
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:38,470
Take Tonk with you.

283
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,800
Send the stuff back with him.

284
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,630
We need other stuff too.
- Don't worry.

285
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,220
Excuse me!

286
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,180
Can you hear me?

287
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,840
What is it?

288
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:56,010
Can I come out
just for a little while?

289
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,260
Why?

290
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,680
Closed spaces

291
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,130
make my head spin.

292
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:10,260
I'm feeling ill.

293
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,380
Let her out.
- I won't try..

294
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,760
M.K. Tripathi.
- ...and run. Just for a while.

295
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,590
This is such an odd place.

296
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,430
I've never seen
a place like this.

297
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,630
We spend all our time in hotels
on our holidays.

298
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,010
No point travelling.

299
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,550
We may just as well
check into a hotel in Delhi.

300
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,720
Hotels are the same everywhere.

301
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,720
Why am I talking so much?

302
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,470
It feels so unreal.

303
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,010
Like I'm watching a movie.

304
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,380
I have no control. Words
pour out without my knowledge.

305
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,970
Actually, I haven't said a word
for almost two days.

306
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,680
Maybe, that's why. Sorry.
- Hey!

307
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:26,090
Here.

308
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:34,470
Anyway, it feels good
sitting out here. So, thank you.

309
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,050
You, come here.

310
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,010
I felt like throwing up inside.

311
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:44,720
That's why, I said..

312
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:49,720
Feels better out here.
It's the fresh air..

313
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:53,550
There's a lot to..
I'm still talking!

314
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,010
What's going on?

315
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,630
I should be tense right now.

316
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,760
I am tensed.

317
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,760
No more talking.

318
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,630
Is the tea good?
- It's different.

319
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,380
It's good. Is there sugar in it
or something else?

320
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,760
Hey! You made the tea.

321
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,970
I added sugar, but maybe
some salt fell in.

322
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,930
There's salt everywhere.

323
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,220
On my face, too.
- Right.

324
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,680
I thought it was only me.

325
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,680
Everyone has got salt on them.

326
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,380
Look at my arm.
Salt here too.

327
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,220
Why did you have
to run away like that?

328
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,970
I told you, I'd make some
arrangement.

329
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,930
Now listen carefully.

330
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,090
Has the salt gone?

331
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,430
No..

332
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:07,760
You better trust me.
How will it work otherwise?

333
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,300
Here's my plan.

334
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,220
Panicking won't help.

335
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,340
The plan is.. Look.
- No!

336
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,630
I know what
you must be thinking, Mahabir.

337
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:42,590
Maybe, you misunderstood
the whole thing.

338
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,090
That's possible, right?

339
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,930
I'll tell you what's going on.
You can..

340
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,010
You've it got wrong. Listen!

341
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,090
She's a consignment.
Not a girl.

342
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,050
I am not arguing..
- That's enough!

343
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:03,550
End of story.
- Okay.

344
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,880
You! Can't you dress decently?

345
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,800
Stop.
- What are you doing?

346
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,340
Let's go.

347
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,630
Are we going now?
- Yes.

348
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,470
Where to?
- No idea.

349
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,510
Will Goru tell everyone?

350
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,880
Shut her mouth!

351
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,510
Tie her hands.
Put her in the truck!

352
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,930
What about the truck papers?

353
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,630
And the state border police?

354
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,800
We need the license plate
registration.

355
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:38,010
Show these papers. They belong
to a junked old truck. Here.

356
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,840
Well done!

357
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,470
Now, what's the plan?

358
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:44,880
We talk to Tonk in Ajmer.
- Shall I switch the phone on?

359
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,930
Throw that SIM card away.

360
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,340
We'll call from a landline.

361
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,880
Stop!

362
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:28,340
Look away!

363
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,430
Where the hell were you?

364
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,010
Where were you?

365
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,050
Have you lost your mind?

366
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,590
How dare you ask?

367
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:53,930
You can go and relieve yourself.
Don't I have to go, too?

368
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,130
Think about it.

369
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:03,930
Come on.

370
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,300
What happened?
- Got through?

371
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:25,930
Yes. Tonk will call her parents
from her phone.

372
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,840
He'll meet us in two days.

373
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,340
Let's go.

374
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,800
I'll sit in the front.

375
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:36,380
I'll break your bones
if you talk nonsense.

376
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:38,220
Okay.

377
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,840
Break my bones.
Satisfy yourself.

378
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:44,050
But I will sit in the front.

379
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,630
No problem.

380
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,260
I'll sit next to her.

381
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:50,840
She'll be sitting
between us. Okay?

382
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:06,180
Sorry. I was very rude.

383
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:13,180
It's strange!
I'm never so rude to anyone.

384
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:14,630
Never!

385
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:18,760
I'm usually very well behaved.

386
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,510
I mean, I have good manners.

387
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,380
And with you..

388
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:26,930
Sorry.

389
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,760
I felt like throwing up..
- Shut up!

390
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,680
I am apologizing.
- Am I apologizing?

391
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,930
Are we here to show off
our good manners?

392
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:41,970
Show them off
in your father's house.

393
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,010
Hurry up!

394
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,720
Hi, Veera!

395
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,800
How are you?

396
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:18,630
How am I?

397
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,590
I'll think about it
and let you know.

398
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,470
Up!

399
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:45,010
What happened, sir?

400
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,260
What's inside?

401
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,510
Nothing, sir.

402
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,930
Nothing?

403
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,470
Driving an empty truck?

404
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:52,550
Just some household goods.

405
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,220
Or stolen goods from Rajasthan?

406
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,470
I swear on my mother, sir.

407
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,380
Get out!
Get down.

408
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,880
Open the back.
- Sir..

409
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:08,760
May I talk to you, sir?
- What is it?

410
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:11,760
We're in a hurry.
- So?

411
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,220
Can we work this out?

412
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:18,010
Bribing the police?
You little scumbag!

413
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:20,090
Do you have the means?
- No, sir.

414
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,840
Open up! Move.

415
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:24,680
Open it!

416
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,590
Open it.

417
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,090
Open up. Right now!

418
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:32,510
Want a caning?

419
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,930
Quick!

420
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:46,930
The other one.

421
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,630
Step aside!

422
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,720
You look dishonest.

423
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:22,470
So, you confused us.
Get going!

424
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,590
Are you offended?

425
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,010
Should I confiscate it?

426
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,550
No, sir.

427
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,260
Let them go.

428
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:09,180
What.. What happened?

429
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:13,630
Were you hiding?

430
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,590
Did you hide?

431
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:24,300
Yes.

432
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:26,380
Why?

433
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:29,340
This was your chance.

434
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,220
Why did you hide?

435
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,680
I don't know.

436
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:36,550
What do you mean?

437
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,260
That's what!
I don't know!

438
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,130
Maybe, I've lost my mind.

439
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:47,010
I could've escaped so easily.

440
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,760
What's wrong with me?

441
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,010
What's going on?

442
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,720
Eat quickly if you want to eat.

443
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,130
We'll not stop
for a long time now.

444
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,470
I was nine years old.

445
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,380
At home..

446
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:35,340
He used to bring
imported chocolates for me.

447
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,510
My uncle.

448
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,550
He made me sit on his lap

449
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,010
and loved me.

450
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,510
And then alone..

451
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,840
In the bathroom

452
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:08,550
he would make me
sit on his lap again

453
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:14,840
and love me.

454
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,970
I used to scream.

455
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,930
But he'd cover my mouth..

456
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:27,380
Like this.

457
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:29,430
Cover my mouth

458
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,090
so that my screams
could not come out.

459
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,050
It hurt so much.

460
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,470
It's all over.

461
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:47,430
We're done.

462
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,300
My doll.

463
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:55,180
You are the best girl
in the whole world.

464
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:00,630
"The most beautiful.."

465
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,970
He came home again.

466
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:10,840
Again and again.

467
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,760
Inside, I was screaming
my lungs out.

468
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:24,090
Don't tell anyone. Okay?

469
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:28,340
One day, I told mummy.

470
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,010
I explained to her.

471
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:38,470
Mummy said

472
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,800
Don't tell anyone.

473
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:49,180
Okay?

474
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:58,220
I didn't tell anyone.

475
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,680
Then one day, it all stopped.

476
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:11,800
But he still visited.

477
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,880
With chocolates for me.

478
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,430
He comes to the house
even now.

479
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:27,300
I sit on his lap.

480
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,680
He loves me.

481
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,300
I smile.

482
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:40,180
My doll.

483
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,630
The most beautiful of all..

484
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:03,880
The beasts!

485
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:09,340
Manners. Culture.

486
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,590
Greet them

487
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,680
touch their feet in respect.

488
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,380
They're all around you.

489
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:27,340
You have to survive among them

490
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,800
laugh with them

491
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,970
befriend them

492
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:37,720
love them.

493
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:26,180
The place you've got me from..

494
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,380
I don't want to go back there.

495
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:39,010
The place we're going to..
I don't want to get there.

496
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:46,630
But this road..

497
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:54,680
It's very good.

498
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:01,300
I want this road to never end.

499
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:17,130
Hello. Get in touch
with ACP Chaudhary.

500
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,260
Ask him to report to my office
urgently.

501
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:23,590
The case was filed at Dera Mandi
Police Station. - Sir.

502
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,220
All the details are in the file.
- Thank you, Vikram.

503
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:27,380
Thanks for everything.

504
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,720
This cannot go public.

505
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,470
The special cell is handling
the case.

506
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:37,760
Information will be shared
with caution.

507
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:40,760
His name is Mahabir Bhaati.
He's on the run.

508
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,760
They're not professional
kidnappers

509
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:45,220
just petty criminals.

510
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:48,010
Kids, run! - Land grabbing,
armed robbery, etcetera.

511
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:52,220
Call from the girl's phone.
Then remove the battery.

512
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,840
A call from Veera's phone.
- Take it.

513
01:00:56,010 --> 01:01:01,380
First let's find out
if you're worth trusting.

514
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:02,720
I'll call later.

515
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,970
The call's from Noida.
Near Delhi border.

516
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,340
DL registration.
Show us the papers.

517
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:24,180
I came of my own accord
to tell you.

518
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:26,050
Why would I lie now?

519
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:30,680
I have no clue
where Mahabir has taken her.

520
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:39,510
I've come from so far
to tell you everything.

521
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:42,010
I'll tell you everything.

522
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:44,010
Hiding information
is out of the question.

523
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:46,430
Just ask!

524
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:50,760
They left this place a week ago.

525
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:52,470
They could be anywhere.

526
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:55,090
I'll tell you when to hand over
the ransom money.

527
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:59,880
Just relax. And wait.
I'll let you know.

528
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:01,430
He called from Calcutta.

529
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:06,930
"The girl dances
and ensnares me.."

530
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:10,180
Move the barricade.
Let them pass.

531
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,300
Check the papers.
- Stop..

532
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:15,050
Get back.
- You have already checked..

533
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:18,010
They have nabbed a person
there. - In Shyambazaar..

534
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:22,550
Move from here.

535
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:27,430
Come out.
- Check the car.

536
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:33,430
Where are you coming from?
- Next state.

537
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:35,430
Let a few pass.
- Show the papers.

538
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:41,260
God knows where she is.

539
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,430
What they're doing to her.

540
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:57,800
"A bite of sweet betel quid."

541
01:02:57,930 --> 01:02:59,590
"A cotton Lahori suit."

542
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:05,630
"In high spirits,
the firefly soars.."

543
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:12,510
"The Lord is your gardener,
O green forest."

544
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:16,090
"Never mind the cuss words,
He watches your every step."

545
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:19,800
"Ignore what the world thinks."

546
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:23,840
"Take the name of God.
Take the name of Ali.."

547
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:27,630
"Take the name of God.
Take the name of Ali.."

548
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,760
"She has taken the path to Him."

549
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:34,430
"She has taken the path to Him."

550
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:38,130
"Ali.."

551
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:43,010
"Travelling on and on.."

552
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:50,550
"Ali.. On your path,
she walks. Ali.."

553
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:54,260
"On your path, she walks."

554
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:10,380
"Firefly, free spirit,
firecracker."

555
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:13,430
"Flying about intoxicated"

556
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:17,550
"all around. Free spirit,
firecracker."

557
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,510
"Flying about intoxicated"

558
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:24,260
"all around."

559
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:29,380
"The Lord is your gardener,
O green forest."

560
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:32,970
"Never mind the cuss words,
He watches your every step."

561
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:36,720
"Ignore what the world thinks."

562
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,760
"Take the name of God.
Take the name of Ali.."

563
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,680
"Take the name of God.
Take the name of Ali.."

564
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:01,720
"Throwing caution to the wind,
I am in Your hands."

565
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:05,380
"Throwing caution to the wind,
I am in Your hands."

566
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:16,300
"Throwing caution to the wind,
I am in Your hands."

567
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:20,180
"Throwing caution to the wind,
I am in Your hands."

568
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:28,130
"God's chosen one,
His most dear one.."

569
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,840
"God will take away
the suffering He inflicts."

570
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:37,380
"Take His name and dance.."

571
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:42,590
"Ali.. Take His name
and dance.."

572
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:47,880
"Ali.."

573
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:54,090
"Take the name of God.
Take the name of Ali.."

574
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:57,090
"Take the name of God.
Take the name of Ali.."

575
01:05:57,430 --> 01:06:01,050
"Growing wild like the fig tree,
worshipped by all."

576
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:04,430
"No one plants her.
No one can cage her."

577
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:08,260
"On this endless journey,
like rainwater falling"

578
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:11,930
"soiled if she
touches the ground."

579
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:15,840
"Just chant the name of Lord.
Give yourself up to Him."

580
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:19,430
"Just chant the name of Lord.
He is everywhere."

581
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:23,090
"Just chant the name of Lord.
Give yourself up to Him."

582
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:28,590
"Just chant the name of Lord.
He is everywhere. Lord.."

583
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:33,090
"Lord.."

584
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:36,930
"Throwing caution to the wind,
I am in Your hands."

585
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:40,630
"Throwing caution to the wind,
I am in Your hands."

586
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:44,380
"Throwing caution to the wind,
I am in Your hands."

587
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:51,430
"Throwing caution to the wind,
I am in Your hands.."

588
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:55,220
"Throwing caution to the wind,
I am in Your hands."

589
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:23,840
Wow!

590
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:28,180
Great!

591
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:32,800
There are such
unique places in this country.

592
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,340
Tell me.

593
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:38,840
Why are the rich fascinated
by dirty, run-down, old ruins?

594
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,880
Step to the side.
Step forward.

595
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:47,260
Hold this.

596
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:51,130
Hold it straight. We need
to show the date.

597
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:53,340
What language is it?
- Bengali.

598
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,760
So that they think
we're in Bengal. Smart!

599
01:07:57,130 --> 01:08:01,010
You've been abducted.
Look upset.

600
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:03,550
Who'd pay ransom for you?

601
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,050
Stop laughing.

602
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:07,130
Be serious.

603
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:10,090
How can I be serious,
looking at you?

604
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,010
Aadoo!

605
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,010
Okay. I'll turn around.

606
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,130
Higher.

607
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:24,880
This place is good.

608
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:27,220
The market is nearby.

609
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,220
Better buy her clothes.

610
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:33,470
She'll stand out like this.

611
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,380
Everything will be okay.

612
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,430
But I'd like to know..

613
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:42,840
If anything goes wrong..
The ransom, the calls.

614
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:46,130
By the way, are we still..

615
01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:50,130
Sticking to our plan?

616
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:53,380
Why?

617
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:55,010
Just asking.

618
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:57,760
We're selling the girl
to a brothel.

619
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:02,300
Okay.
- Don't get fond of her.

620
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:04,050
Nothing like that.

621
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:06,340
Is she the only respectable one?

622
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:10,050
What about the poor girls?

623
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:13,760
Women are taken away at night.

624
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,680
For some big shot
from the city.

625
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:19,010
A woman is required tonight.

626
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:21,550
And who takes her to him?

627
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,300
Let it be..
- Her own husband!

628
01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:25,720
Her man.

629
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:32,470
He sits outside while his wife
is inside with the big shot.

630
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:34,680
Then the door opens

631
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,970
and he brings his wife
back home.

632
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,680
And he takes out all his
frustrations on the woman.

633
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:50,550
Because the rich can exploit us
whenever they feel like.

634
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:54,050
To hell with them!

635
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:57,010
To hell with them!

636
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:16,220
Drop it.

637
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:18,340
He's not in the mood.

638
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:20,090
I'll fix his mood.

639
01:10:35,470 --> 01:10:36,550
Are you mad?

640
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:38,630
Never do that.

641
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:41,300
Got it.

642
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:46,050
What is it?

643
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:53,550
You asked him to buy
clothes for me.

644
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:56,010
Aadoo told me.

645
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:00,130
Stop acting. I look very nice.

646
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,720
What is this song?

647
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:14,470
Well?
- Why do you want to know?

648
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,590
I want to hear the song.

649
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:18,430
That's it.

650
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:21,720
Go now.

651
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:24,840
Mahabir Bhaati.

652
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:45,010
Where did you hear it?
- Why should I tell you?

653
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:48,220
Now, I have to know.

654
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:50,680
What song was that?

655
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:56,300
It's not a song.

656
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:58,340
Then?

657
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:00,880
So where did you hear it?

658
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:04,180
My mother used to sing it.

659
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:08,380
Really?
Wow!

660
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,470
For you?

661
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,260
Tell me. Please! - Yes,
she used to sing it for me.

662
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:22,510
When she went to work,
I went with her.

663
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:27,300
I'd cry, so she'd sing. Okay?

664
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:29,880
You used to cry!

665
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,590
Does your mother live with you?

666
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:43,590
Enough. Go inside!

667
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:45,050
Stand up!

668
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:49,340
You see,
I don't feel like going.

669
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:52,050
Too smart!
- Right!

670
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:55,180
I'm not scared anymore.

671
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:57,760
Don't get offended, but..

672
01:12:58,510 --> 01:13:00,880
I find you really cute now.

673
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:07,260
So, what made you cry?
Tell me.

674
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:09,090
Who troubled the little one?

675
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:13,180
Sorry! I won't ask again.
Listen..

676
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,010
"Sleep now."

677
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:40,630
"Do not cry."

678
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,260
Look down!

679
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:57,510
Where's your mind?
You burnt the food.

680
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:37,010
"My adored son, sleep now."

681
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:42,590
"Your dreams will carry you"

682
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:46,260
"to a field
of sweet delights."

683
01:14:46,430 --> 01:14:51,720
"The parrot on the tree"

684
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:56,970
"tells you"

685
01:14:57,380 --> 01:15:00,220
"to smile."

686
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:07,630
"The swan wants
to befriend you."

687
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:13,840
"My adored son."

688
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:21,300
"My adored son."

689
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:47,720
"The night is as dark as coal."

690
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:54,760
"Your eyes fill with sleep."

691
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:58,630
"With a blanket of stars
covering you."

692
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:02,340
"Sleep a sweet sleep."

693
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:17,130
"The night is as dark as coal."

694
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:23,760
"Your eyes fill with sleep."

695
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:28,470
"With a blanket of stars
covering you."

696
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:32,220
"Sleep a sweet sleep."

697
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:39,430
"If you toss and turn"

698
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:46,840
"the mynah bird
will steal you away."

699
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:04,970
"A falling star,
a little star."

700
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:08,590
"A falling star."

701
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:14,970
"It asks after you."

702
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:18,590
"Why don't you sleep?
Why do you cry?"

703
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:24,840
"Why did you get so lost?"

704
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:33,430
"What upset you?
Who upset you?"

705
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:38,430
"What did you leave behind
in the land you came from?"

706
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,010
Your mother..

707
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,470
What do you call her?

708
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,970
Mom.

709
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:17,470
So..

710
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:21,470
Is she well?

711
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,180
I mean..

712
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:31,300
Is she all right?

713
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:42,760
You have to promise me,
Mahabir.

714
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:46,180
Once we're done with all this

715
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:48,550
you'll see her.

716
01:18:51,090 --> 01:18:52,130
Where is she?

717
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:58,760
In the village.

718
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:03,180
So, you'll go to the village
and see her.

719
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:05,630
Okay?

720
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,300
Promise?

721
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:30,510
"Tell me what is in your heart."

722
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:37,970
"Share your thoughts with me."

723
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:45,010
"The parrot on the tree"

724
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:48,930
"tells you"

725
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:52,380
"to smile."

726
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:59,760
"The swan wants
to befriend you."

727
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:05,180
"Sleep now, my adored son."

728
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:13,300
"Sleep now, my adored son."

729
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:18,550
"Sleep now, my adored son."

730
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:27,470
"Sleep now, my adored son."

731
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,840
It's in English, right?
- Totally in English, sir.

732
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:43,510
This one.

733
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:58,470
"Let me dominate you.."

734
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:02,930
"Dominate your body.
Terminate this naughty."

735
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:08,760
"Let me dominate your..
Dominate your body."

736
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,380
"Terminate this naughty."

737
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:14,340
"I am a hot Tamale.
Red Chille me, finale."

738
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:18,380
"Fire like Bob Marley.
Do you wanna mash up, mash up."

739
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:22,220
"I am a hot Tamale.
Red chille me, finale."

740
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:26,550
"Fire like Bob Marley.
Do you wanna mash up, mash up."

741
01:21:27,010 --> 01:21:30,180
"Shout it out loud."

742
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:34,220
"Something about these streets.
The way my mind's on a spree."

743
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:36,340
"As I listen to this beat."

744
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:40,630
"listen, listen to this beat..
I got a feeling so real."

745
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:44,260
"Do you see what I see?
The way you make me feel."

746
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:48,260
"Makes my heart beat a mill.
This is the real deal"

747
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:52,470
"it's like the type of thrill
that I wanna be about."

748
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:56,220
"Wanna wanna be about.
Wanna shout it out loud."

749
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:58,300
"Shout it,
shout it out loud."

750
01:21:58,430 --> 01:22:02,180
"I am a hot Tamale.
Red chille me, finale."

751
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:06,470
"Fire like Bob Marley.
Do you wanna mash up, mash up."

752
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:10,180
"I am a hot Tamale.
Red chille me, finale."

753
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:14,470
"Fire like Bob Marley.
Do you wanna mash up, mash up."

754
01:22:14,590 --> 01:22:15,590
"Boy."

755
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:22,510
"You try to chain me,
slave me."

756
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:26,840
"Hate me, flame me..
Oh, you know you can't tame me."

757
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:32,720
"Boom like Bob Marley,
my swag is so gnarly."

758
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:36,880
"You be so dizzy izzy. Mash up
the beat, we'd be getting busy."

759
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:38,880
"Wake up in it,
now mash up with it."

760
01:22:39,010 --> 01:22:40,840
"Walk up in it,
gotta get it, get it."

761
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:48,300
"I am a hot Tamale.
Red Chille me, finale."

762
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:51,760
"Fire like Bob Marley.
Do you wanna.."

763
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:07,010
Come.

764
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,430
Take your stuff.

765
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:24,630
Chandigarh bus station?

766
01:23:25,470 --> 01:23:30,050
I'm proud of you. Okay, bye.

767
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:34,300
Are you leaving?
- Yes. I have to.

768
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,180
Take care of yourself.

769
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:40,050
We'll meet again.

770
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:43,760
Let's go.

771
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:36,340
Look there.

772
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:39,680
A police station. Go inside
and talk to the man in charge.

773
01:24:40,090 --> 01:24:41,840
Tell him your name
and your father's name.

774
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:44,840
Say that you're
the kidnapped girl.

775
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:46,130
You know that I won't go.

776
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:49,090
Take your phone.
Call your home first.

777
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:51,300
Can't you hear me?
I won't go.

778
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:55,090
You won't go? So what
will you do with me?

779
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,720
Marry me?

780
01:24:58,090 --> 01:24:59,430
Raise my kids?

781
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:00,930
What will you do?

782
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:02,760
What's come over you?

783
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:05,300
Why create a scene?

784
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:06,680
What will you do with me?

785
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:08,760
Well?

786
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:11,050
You know who I am.

787
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:12,630
That's just it.

788
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:14,880
I know who you really are.

789
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:16,880
I killed three people.

790
01:25:17,470 --> 01:25:18,760
I have..

791
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:22,010
With these very hands.

792
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,430
My life is over.
It'll never get fixed.

793
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:31,930
Never.

794
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:35,430
I will only die.
You should go back.

795
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:37,510
Go back to Delhi.

796
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,430
How will I, Mahabir?

797
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,840
Look. I'm telling you to go.

798
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:48,050
It'll be a disaster. Go away!

799
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:50,090
What's your story?

800
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:52,300
How did this happen?
- Shut up!

801
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,720
Go to the police station.

802
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:57,260
I won't go. What will you do?

803
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:01,550
What the hell! Let go!
Mahabir, let me go!

804
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:02,430
Quietly, come along.

805
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:05,090
Are you that strong?
I won't go.

806
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:06,590
Don't drive me crazy.

807
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,630
I won't go.
Kill me too!

808
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:13,840
Stop, Mahabir.

809
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:15,840
Don't be childish.
Are you crazy?

810
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:22,050
What's wrong?

811
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,340
Hello!

812
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:46,680
One minute.
I have to make a call.

813
01:26:56,090 --> 01:26:58,090
Hey!
- Hello..

814
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:05,010
Get up!

815
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:26,510
Where do I catch the bus
to Chandigarh?

816
01:27:26,630 --> 01:27:28,510
Reckong Peo bus stand.
- Reckong Peo.

817
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:31,760
Reckong Peo bus stand?
- Get in.

818
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,800
Shimla..

819
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,760
Get this straight.

820
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:39,880
Whatever happens, you don't
decide alone. Got it?

821
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:42,930
Move away. Stand there,
near the bench.

822
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:22,800
"I was bound to come this way."

823
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:30,340
"My path is somewhere here."

824
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:35,010
"I stand at the crossroads."

825
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:42,720
"The journey opens
its arms to me."

826
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:50,010
"Where am I?"

827
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:56,340
"Where am I?"

828
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:06,130
"Where am I?"

829
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:12,090
"Sighs, fear,
happiness, paths.."

830
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:20,220
"Brittle words,
true relations.."

831
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:24,840
"Among all these"

832
01:30:24,970 --> 01:30:30,510
"where am I?"

833
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:08,380
A 20 minute stop. Be quick!

834
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:31,760
There's no plan
of raising kids

835
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:39,720
or marrying.

836
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:43,680
There's no plan.

837
01:31:46,090 --> 01:31:48,590
All I want is a little more.

838
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:51,760
A little longer with you.

839
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,680
I never felt like this before.

840
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:00,090
The way I feel with you..

841
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:02,970
I can do anything.

842
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,260
Anything I feel like.

843
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:07,130
And you'll handle it.

844
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:11,630
I don't even have to think.

845
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,430
I've never felt like this.

846
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,720
But I'm being very selfish.

847
01:32:23,090 --> 01:32:24,630
You'll be in trouble.

848
01:32:25,220 --> 01:32:27,380
They thought
we were in Calcutta.

849
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,090
Now they'll know
that we're here.

850
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:35,130
Nothing can save us now, right?

851
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:41,510
Oh no! All ruined!

852
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:53,180
What now?

853
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,380
Let's sit on top.

854
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:01,590
What?
- On the roof.

855
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,430
Coming?

856
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:09,800
Let's decide the next move..
- You talk too much.

857
01:33:11,930 --> 01:33:12,930
Come on.

858
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:52,430
"Wrapped in clouds
of white wool"

859
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:59,470
"I am like the winter breeze."

860
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:04,430
"Not caring what's left behind."

861
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:07,590
"Not seeing what lies ahead."

862
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:14,130
"I ask myself.."

863
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:17,840
"Where am I?"

864
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:25,090
"Where am I?"

865
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:30,260
"Where am I, now?"

866
01:34:32,050 --> 01:34:35,510
"Where am I?"

867
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:40,880
"Where am I, now?"

868
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:51,720
"Finding myself
amidst lost desires.."

869
01:34:54,510 --> 01:35:01,930
"Firm desires, shaky pursuits."

870
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:10,510
"In all of this"

871
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:18,970
"where"

872
01:35:23,550 --> 01:35:27,630
"am I?"

873
01:35:58,130 --> 01:35:59,680
What are you staring at?

874
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:03,760
You like the mountains
or the sea?

875
01:36:05,550 --> 01:36:07,760
I've never seen the sea.

876
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:11,680
I like the mountains more, too.

877
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:14,380
Like that one.

878
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:17,090
It is calling out to me.

879
01:36:18,430 --> 01:36:19,930
I wish we could go there.

880
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:25,630
Then come along.

881
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:29,590
We'll go there!

882
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:31,590
Got other plans?

883
01:36:33,630 --> 01:36:36,470
Okay. Let's go.

884
01:36:57,510 --> 01:37:00,470
Please! For one second.

885
01:37:16,630 --> 01:37:18,510
Are you done? Give it back.

886
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:22,550
Enough. Give it here.

887
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:25,050
It has power, boss.

888
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:29,470
Hands up!
- I'll give you a tight slap.

889
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:36,970
It's not a toy. Give it to me.

890
01:37:38,590 --> 01:37:39,630
Tell me something.

891
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:43,590
One bullet and a man
is finished, right?

892
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:46,880
Two are finished.

893
01:37:50,010 --> 01:37:51,470
The one who gets shot

894
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:55,090
and the one who shoots.

895
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:00,130
It's a bad thing.
Give it to me.

896
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:02,720
So why don't you throw it away?

897
01:38:03,970 --> 01:38:04,930
Why keep it?

898
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:09,010
What the hell do you know?

899
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:11,590
I can see.

900
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:18,380
We won't fight.

901
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:20,510
No fighting.

902
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:25,300
Don't say such things.

903
01:38:28,090 --> 01:38:29,340
Again?

904
01:38:29,470 --> 01:38:31,090
Okay, sorry!

905
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:33,010
Let's go.

906
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:36,510
Let's race.

907
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:39,300
Ready, steady, go!

908
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:44,180
I wanted a home
on a mountain like this.

909
01:40:45,130 --> 01:40:46,510
Always wanted one.

910
01:40:48,180 --> 01:40:49,590
My home.

911
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:51,180
My dream.

912
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:53,470
Pick any mountain you like.

913
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:55,470
They're all ours.

914
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:57,090
Really?

915
01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:58,800
Yes, they belong to us.

916
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:01,220
They'll be here whenever
you come back.

917
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:04,510
I'm choosing one.
- Sure, go ahead.

918
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:05,970
I don't know why I'm..

919
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:52,630
Keep this.
- No..

920
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:54,130
This is my dream home.

921
01:43:55,090 --> 01:43:56,800
Exactly how I want it.

922
01:43:57,970 --> 01:43:59,430
We're saved so much work.

923
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:10,050
Okay?
- Okay.

924
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:13,970
Be comfortable. The owners
won't be back soon.

925
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:20,550
Hungry? Okay.
- Yes.

926
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:22,430
Ten minutes.
I'll make something.

927
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:25,090
Freshen up and just relax.

928
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,340
Leave it. I'll do it.

929
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:30,010
No. This is my home
Now out!

930
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:31,800
Who's denying it?
- Out.

931
01:44:32,010 --> 01:44:33,760
Let me clean up.
- Out.

932
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:50,760
Come on in!

933
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:04,220
What is it?
- One minute.

934
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:21,800
No..
- No way.

935
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:24,260
This can never be mine.

936
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:28,680
I've come so far away.

937
01:47:30,630 --> 01:47:32,430
20 years.

938
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:42,090
No, Mahabir.
Everything will be all right.

939
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:46,090
Mom!
Everything is over.

940
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:52,470
I was once my mother's
adored son.

941
01:47:53,630 --> 01:47:55,470
Mom..

942
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:37,010
Mahabir..
Mahabir, where's your gun?

943
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:38,180
Where's your gun?

944
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:40,050
I threw it away.
- Veera Tripathi?

945
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:42,550
Stay away!

946
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:44,840
Back off!

947
01:51:51,130 --> 01:51:53,930
Get back!

948
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:01,380
It's all right.
- Veera Tripathi?

949
01:52:01,590 --> 01:52:05,470
What did you shoot?
Rascal! Why shoot?

950
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:06,880
What was he doing?

951
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:12,300
Veera, listen.
- Move back.

952
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:15,630
I'll kill everyone.. - Veera,
he needs to be hospitalized.

953
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:17,130
Veera, there's no time.

954
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:19,260
He'll die. He needs
to be hospitalized.

955
01:52:19,380 --> 01:52:22,090
Nothing will happen to him.

956
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:24,510
We have to take him immediately.
Please! - Mahabir..

957
01:52:25,130 --> 01:52:29,430
Let's go. Mahabir..
Help him. - Stretcher.

958
01:52:34,130 --> 01:52:38,220
Listen to me. I'll take you
to your village.

959
01:52:38,470 --> 01:52:40,760
Okay? Promise!
To your mom.

960
01:52:41,090 --> 01:52:44,010
I said everything will be okay.
Didn't I?

961
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:46,180
Nothing has gone wrong.

962
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,760
I am telling you.
Nothing has changed.

963
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,510
See for yourself.

964
01:52:57,970 --> 01:52:59,300
Veera.

965
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:04,260
I know what you're thinking.

966
01:53:04,590 --> 01:53:06,760
But you know nothing.

967
01:53:07,590 --> 01:53:08,800
Okay. Anyway..

968
01:53:08,930 --> 01:53:10,720
The important thing is
that we save Mahabir.

969
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:12,720
Papa, please. We need
to save Mahabir.

970
01:53:13,930 --> 01:53:15,090
He kidnapped me.

971
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:18,130
But it's not what it seems.
Quite the opposite. - What..

972
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:19,430
What's happened, child?

973
01:53:19,550 --> 01:53:21,430
Nothing has happened.

974
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:23,010
I am fine.
- Veera.

975
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:24,840
Who is this man?
Who is this man?

976
01:53:24,970 --> 01:53:28,220
I am fine.
- Sit down.

977
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:31,380
Let go.
- Easy! Gently.

978
01:53:31,510 --> 01:53:34,840
Papa, please!
- Calm down.

979
01:53:35,050 --> 01:53:37,590
What's that for? This injection?

980
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:40,590
Papa, listen to me. Please.

981
01:53:41,010 --> 01:53:42,630
You don't understand.

982
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:47,340
Okay. Wait. One second.
Here's what.

983
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:49,340
There's something
I want to tell you.

984
01:53:49,550 --> 01:53:51,880
Stop.

985
01:53:54,380 --> 01:53:56,090
Quiet.

986
01:53:56,510 --> 01:53:58,220
Why don't you understand?

987
01:53:59,470 --> 01:54:04,300
What have you done?
You don't get it! - Veera..

988
01:54:04,550 --> 01:54:08,260
Sleep! You're exhausted.
You have to sleep. Okay?

989
01:54:08,630 --> 01:54:11,880
Sleep. Sleep..
- No..

990
01:54:28,930 --> 01:54:31,340
He died on the spot.
At around 9.30.

991
01:54:31,630 --> 01:54:33,510
Before we could get him
on the stretcher, he died.

992
01:54:33,970 --> 01:54:38,550
I see. - Can we take Veera
back to Delhi?

993
01:54:39,010 --> 01:54:40,630
Sure.
- Thank you.

994
01:54:43,380 --> 01:54:45,970
Where's the body?
- In the mortuary.

995
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:48,380
The post-mortem?
- Done, sir.

996
01:54:52,380 --> 01:54:55,430
Mahabir Bhaati.
- Right, sir.

997
01:55:08,430 --> 01:55:11,880
Navita, come here.
I'll prepare the injection.

998
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:46,340
Vinay's mom wants to see you.

999
01:55:47,470 --> 01:55:49,970
Be nice to her. Okay?

1000
01:55:51,010 --> 01:55:52,760
Be pleasant.

1001
01:55:53,510 --> 01:55:55,130
Like everything was normal.

1002
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:57,090
What do you think, Veera?

1003
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:59,340
In which city should we have
the wedding?

1004
01:56:01,930 --> 01:56:03,680
M.K. was saying New York.

1005
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:05,760
Convenient for everyone.

1006
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:08,180
Guess what, Veera.
We're engaged.

1007
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:10,340
You know, the other day,
I came back home from work

1008
01:56:10,470 --> 01:56:11,470
and he had done up

1009
01:56:11,590 --> 01:56:14,470
my entire room with flowers,
candles.. - She's not interested

1010
01:56:14,590 --> 01:56:18,880
in the story.
- Of course, she is.

1011
01:56:24,590 --> 01:56:27,050
Every winter they say
it's so cold.

1012
01:56:27,550 --> 01:56:30,220
Every summer that say
that it's too warm.

1013
01:56:30,470 --> 01:56:33,260
Absolutely.
- Why is it such a surprise?

1014
01:56:33,470 --> 01:56:35,930
Every year..
- What happened?

1015
01:56:41,050 --> 01:56:42,550
Why are you coming down?

1016
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:44,970
Where is the nurse?
- Let her come.

1017
01:56:45,550 --> 01:56:47,090
Come on, dear.

1018
01:56:47,930 --> 01:56:50,010
Slowly. Careful.

1019
01:56:51,590 --> 01:56:53,470
Come in.

1020
01:56:56,430 --> 01:56:57,680
Good.

1021
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:09,220
So, how are you
feeling now?

1022
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:12,130
Better.

1023
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:18,930
And you?

1024
01:57:19,260 --> 01:57:21,300
We're fine.

1025
01:57:21,970 --> 01:57:26,010
Just worried about you.
Hope you'll get better soon.

1026
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:30,880
She looks much better.

1027
01:57:38,430 --> 01:57:41,260
Hi, Vinay.
- Hi, Veera.

1028
01:57:46,010 --> 01:57:49,470
I found my home on a mountain.

1029
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:51,760
Really?

1030
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:53,380
I cooked food.

1031
01:57:55,180 --> 01:57:56,970
I cleaned my house too.

1032
01:58:00,130 --> 01:58:01,760
Then the bullet was fired.

1033
01:58:02,930 --> 01:58:04,840
Vinay loves the mountains,
right?

1034
01:58:05,130 --> 01:58:08,510
That Austrian resort? You know
Veera's favorite.. - The ski..

1035
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:11,130
The ski resort.
- I always said

1036
01:58:12,590 --> 01:58:14,470
that I would run away.

1037
01:58:15,590 --> 01:58:17,260
I don't want
to live in the city.

1038
01:58:19,470 --> 01:58:20,840
Doesn't everyone say that?

1039
01:58:21,970 --> 01:58:23,590
But who runs away?

1040
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:26,760
I wouldn't have either

1041
01:58:30,050 --> 01:58:33,050
if Mahabir hadn't kidnapped me
and taken me away.

1042
01:58:37,590 --> 01:58:39,300
But now..

1043
01:58:41,470 --> 01:58:43,180
I'm gone.

1044
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:48,380
I cannot come back.

1045
01:58:48,590 --> 01:58:52,090
Veera, I think you should rest.

1046
01:58:52,340 --> 01:58:53,760
We'll talk later.

1047
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:56,430
It's so strange.

1048
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:00,010
I was kidnapped

1049
01:59:02,510 --> 01:59:04,550
but I was free there.

1050
01:59:07,380 --> 01:59:09,220
I'm in prison here.

1051
01:59:09,340 --> 01:59:11,760
Hey.. Anyway.

1052
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:14,880
Pratima.
- Come on, Veera.

1053
01:59:16,130 --> 01:59:18,340
Is this my home?
- Come!

1054
01:59:23,010 --> 01:59:25,180
No chocolates today,
Mr. Shukla?

1055
01:59:25,550 --> 01:59:26,930
I'll order some now.

1056
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:29,630
Where?

1057
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:34,050
Where will you give them to me?

1058
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:37,220
Here? Or in the bathroom?

1059
01:59:37,380 --> 01:59:39,930
Quiet.
Enough of this.

1060
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:44,720
Yes, mummy? Is there
something you want to say?

1061
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:50,340
Stupid. I don't know
what she's talking about.

1062
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:52,970
Can't you remember?

1063
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:54,800
Let me remind you.

1064
01:59:56,010 --> 01:59:57,470
My princess.

1065
01:59:58,220 --> 02:00:01,470
You're the most beautiful girl
in the world. My doll.

1066
02:00:03,590 --> 02:00:05,050
Remember?

1067
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:06,760
With your hands

1068
02:00:07,340 --> 02:00:12,220
how you'd cover my mouth

1069
02:00:14,180 --> 02:00:17,590
so that my screams
could not be heard.

1070
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:20,720
Well?

1071
02:00:22,430 --> 02:00:24,340
All my screams..

1072
02:00:26,130 --> 02:00:28,930
My cries of pain..

1073
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:32,220
To keep my screams silent

1074
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:35,130
you forced my mouth shut. Hush!

1075
02:00:35,590 --> 02:00:37,180
Control her!

1076
02:00:38,010 --> 02:00:42,260
Priya. Hold her, please.
- In the bathroom..

1077
02:00:43,180 --> 02:00:44,760
Again and again.
- Veera.

1078
02:00:45,510 --> 02:00:46,630
The running tap..

1079
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:48,050
Where were you, nurse?

1080
02:00:48,380 --> 02:00:50,380
Take her away.
- She has really gone crazy.

1081
02:00:50,510 --> 02:00:51,720
They are right.

1082
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:56,590
I used to scream. I was nine!

1083
02:00:57,130 --> 02:00:59,260
That hand was over my mouth.

1084
02:01:00,090 --> 02:01:02,470
My cries were silenced.
No one heard me.

1085
02:01:02,590 --> 02:01:06,180
Mad! She has gone mad.
Ask her to shut up, Manu.

1086
02:01:06,340 --> 02:01:08,090
Ask her to shut..
- Shut up!

1087
02:01:43,930 --> 02:01:47,380
Yes. It happens.

1088
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:50,760
These things happen
all the time.

1089
02:01:53,130 --> 02:01:54,470
So you know what?

1090
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:57,180
I'm not okay with it.

1091
02:01:58,590 --> 02:01:59,930
This world

1092
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:02,720
where this happens..

1093
02:02:04,510 --> 02:02:07,430
Where you can't tell a lie

1094
02:02:08,550 --> 02:02:10,090
from the truth.

1095
02:02:11,930 --> 02:02:13,720
Everything is mixed up.

1096
02:02:15,510 --> 02:02:17,680
There's so much confusion.

1097
02:02:18,180 --> 02:02:20,470
Veera. Baby..

1098
02:02:23,260 --> 02:02:26,470
Okay. Let's be sensible.
- No!

1099
02:02:27,970 --> 02:02:32,260
I will not be sensible.
I'm stupid. I'll remain stupid.

1100
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:35,760
Relax.

1101
02:02:36,180 --> 02:02:37,630
Sensible?

1102
02:02:40,720 --> 02:02:44,720
Veera, be careful
when you go out.

1103
02:02:46,340 --> 02:02:48,220
Strangers are bad.

1104
02:02:50,010 --> 02:02:51,970
A girl should always be careful.

1105
02:02:56,550 --> 02:02:58,050
Why didn't you ever say

1106
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:01,720
that I should be careful
inside the house too?

1107
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:06,470
That I should also protect
myself from you.

1108
02:03:08,590 --> 02:03:10,220
Why didn't you ever tell me?

1109
02:03:12,470 --> 02:03:14,630
I was so exposed here.

1110
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:17,180
Inside my own house.

1111
02:03:20,010 --> 02:03:22,050
So, I don't want to be sensible.

1112
02:03:23,630 --> 02:03:26,130
I am foolish. I'm bad.

1113
02:03:27,180 --> 02:03:29,550
But I am not one of you.

1114
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:36,760
I will not come back.

1115
02:04:08,970 --> 02:04:12,970
"Admire the diamond"

1116
02:04:13,090 --> 02:04:16,880

Mahabir!

1128
02:05:20,550 --> 02:05:23,550
Mahabir!

1129

"Don't display a diamond
in the vegetable market."

1130

"Just tie it safely
and wait for your turn."

1131
02:05:42,130 --> 02:05:45,880
"Admire the diamond"

02:06:01,590 --> 02:06:05,800

1138
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:29,430
Done? Okay.

1139
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:36,220
Bye.
- Bye.

1140
