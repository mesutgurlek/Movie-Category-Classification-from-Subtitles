1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,760
Previously on 90210:

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,200
Come on,beverly hills is going
to be great r far ou Mily.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,670
we got the weather,we got the
palm trees with themore palm trees.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,340
- more palm trees.
- More palm trees.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,980
You had,like,a million friends.

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,030
Back home.

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,220
And they all knew about
the whole adoption story.

8
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,770
Ethan,this is annie,the
new principal's daughter.

9
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,230
Annie,my boyfriend,ethan.

10
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,110
Yeah,well,actually,yeah,we-we
know each other.

11
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:20,600
We met,like,two summers ago?

12
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,820
- Hey,ty.
- Yeah. You want to grab dinner tonight after rehearsal?

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,900
- ya
- You can spence anybody.

14
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,920
- Annie!
- Ty.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,330
I wanted to bring you these.

16
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,520
If you guys want to grab
some food,I can watch sammy.

17
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,630
You just got here.

18
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,820
Don't worry,I'll be here for a while.

19
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,750
I went to dad's office last night,and
I saw him there kissing another woman.

20
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,010
I'm gonna take you home,okay?

21
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,480
Okay. It's okay.

22
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,910
In eighth grade,my dad had an affair.

23
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,280
I had to tell someone,so I
told my best friend,naomi.

24
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,070
She promised me that
she wouldn't tell anyone.

25
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,980
So she told everyone.

26
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,310
Well,I got some bad news.

27
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,930
I just got off the phone
with your drama teacher.

28
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,330
Got a family emergency in atlanta and she
is taking an indefinite leave of absence.

29
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,620
So what does that mean?

30
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,020
You're not canceling
the musical,are you?

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,240
Well,if I can't find somebody Ise
I don't know that I have a choice.

32
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,620
Dad,no!

33
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,590
We've been rehearsing for
weeks and the show is amazing.

34
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,900
Can't you just find
someone to supervise us?

35
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,470
Harry,how hard could it be to
find an acting coach in L.A.?

36
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,580
I mean,I could throw a rock
out the window and hit an actor.

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,510
Fine. I'll do it.

38
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,470
- What?
- What?

39
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,330
I'll direct the musical.

40
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,460
Uh,but... but,grandma,uh...
you're so busy writing your memoir.

41
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,240
Sweetheart,when the theater is
in pain,I come to mend the wound.

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,780
O... okay.

43
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,510
Tabitha,that is a very nice offer.

44
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,520
Annie,you are very lucky.

45
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,070
I'm so excited.

46
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm excited,too.

47
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,110
I have to remember some of those
breathing exercises I used to do.

48
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,240
I had a director who'd say,

49
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,760
if you're not breathing from your
ass and reaching to the skies,

50
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,730
the back row won't hear you.

51
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,240
I slept with him.

52
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,830
now I know you don't love
it,but it's great,and,hon.

53
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,890
Mom,okay,stop?

54
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,700
I think that your
foundation's a little dark.

55
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,690
It's the same one I
use every single day.

56
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,560
Merry early christmas,everybody.

57
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,930
Both my girls look beautiful.

58
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,450
Why are we shooting the
christmas photo without jen?

59
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,530
We're gonna photoshop it in.

60
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,240
What?That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

61
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,400
Can we just shoot this,please?

62
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,270
All right,everyone get in real close.

63
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,390
Linda and bob are
gonna start renovating.

64
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,660
So I was gonna offer
them the beach house.

65
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,570
I've already offeredfor the same reason.

66
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,350
Charles,would you mind
turning towards tracy?

67
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,900
There's a big space right
here between you two.

68
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,570
I wish I could live at the beach house.

69
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,090
- What does that mean?
- Tracy,you're looking a little stiff.

70
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,740
Charles,can you put your arms
around both ladies,please?

71
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,220
Naomi,can I get a smile?

72
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,400
And,tracy and charles,can I get
a little kiss between you two?

73
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,300
could you hurry up,please?It's
really hot out here.

74
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,950
It's an out-of-town
emergency. Give me a second.

75
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,740
why do we even bother?

76
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,480
Naomi

77
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,290
- it'll be just a second.
- Okay.

78
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,890
Dixon,your mom is driving me to school.

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,270
You can take my car.

80
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,330
Sweet.

81
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,570
You call the realtor this morning?

82
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,400
Only one couple looked
at the house this month.

83
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,070
Not surprising.

84
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,610
Tough market.

85
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,810
What's going on?

86
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,400
We're having trouble
selling the house in kansas.

87
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,180
Is that a bad thing?

88
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,660
It's not a good thing.

89
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,900
We're paying a mortgage on
a house we're not living in.

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,860
It's not like we're paying rent here.

91
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,550
Yeah,but we still got expenses.

92
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,270
We got moving expenses,gas priceshey,

93
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,290
hey,don't worry about it.

94
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,950
We're fine.

95
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,980
hi,mom.

96
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,600
Where are we going for dinner tonight?

97
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,260
I made reservations at craft.

98
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,570
Is dad coming?

99
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,090
He has a meeting.

100
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,190
Is that code for "sleeping
with his girlfriend"?

101
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,890
- Naomi...
- mom,how can you live like this?

102
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,080
How can you just accept that
dad's with another woman?

103
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,960
How is that okay?Can you explain
that to me?'Cause I just don't get it.

104
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,650
It's just a casual fling,that's all.

105
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,710
She doesn't even live here.

106
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,560
So what,mom?

107
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,870
He's still cheating on you.

108
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,980
This is between me and your dad.

109
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,490
Stay out of it.

110
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,120
I'm not discussing this with you again.

111
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,700
Do you understand?

112
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,500
Perfectly.

113
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,440
I wish we could've done
breakfast at the peach pit.

114
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,870
I hate early morning meetings.

115
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,260
Don't worry about it.

116
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,760
I'm getting a kick out of being here.

117
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,650
I can almost still hear the chanting.

118
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,940
- Donna martin graduates.
- Donna martin graduates.

119
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,510
"That's crazy.

120
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,260
Oh,thank you very much. Now that's
gonna be stuck in my head all day.

121
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,940
Speaking of,have you seen donna?

122
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,790
Yes. And,oh,my god,her baby
is so cute,I can't stand it.

123
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,970
I know. How's the play?

124
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,200
It's good. I mean,the taper
just went through a renovation

125
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,360
so it's a really nice house to perform
in. You're gonna come see me,right?

126
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,590
Of course. I wouldn't miss it.

127
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,030
- So... dirt.
- What?

128
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,080
- Ryan.
- Ryan. Okay.

129
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,640
Um... he's nice.

130
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,730
I like him.

131
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,200
We work together,so it's awkward.

132
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,910
And he's ten years younger
than me,which makes it bizarre.

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,890
I asked him where he was when kurt cobain
died and he said he was watching cartoons.

134
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,280
Does he know about ryan?

135
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,930
Why would he need to know?

136
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,620
It's none of his business.

137
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,490
Well,it may be his business if
things get more serious with ryan.

138
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,720
You know,because of sammy.

139
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,620
Well,let me worry about that.

140
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,500
Fair enough.

141
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,460
Ethan,I'm a mess.

142
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,570
I'm freaking out.

143
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,120
My family is so fake.

144
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,980
I mean,my sister's being photoshopped
into the christmas card from paris.

145
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,640
My dad is kissing my mom
while having an affair.

146
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,120
Look,I don'T... I'm sorry
you're going through this.

147
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,330
Thank you.

148
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,710
- But,look,naomi...
- I know.

149
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,860
We're not together anymore.

150
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,520
But it's really good to talk to you.

151
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,140
oh,damn.

152
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,300
why were trying to fit that
tank into a compact space?

153
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,900
Uh... I thought I had room.

154
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,050
Do you know how much
parts cost on german cars?

155
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,150
A lot?

156
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,880
Just give me your insurance info.

157
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,900
Um... listen,uh... do you think there's
any way we can handle this between us?

158
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,350
Oh,you don't have insurance.

159
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,330
No,no,my dad does,but i
don't want him to find out.

160
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,270
You know,he won't let
me drive the car anymore.

161
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,950
I can get you the cash.

162
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,360
I'm good for it,I swear.

163
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,850
It's not like you don't
know what school I go to,man.

164
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,590
It's not like I'm gonna
disappear or anything.

165
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,890
Just please do me this solid,man,please.

166
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,200
My dad's away on business
for a couple weeks.

167
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,560
I just need the cash
before he gets back.

168
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,310
Hey,kelly.

169
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,690
Um,so about saturday.

170
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,060
There's a new pizza place in silverlake. And
apparently it's good,like new york good.

171
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,760
Oh,saturday,I can't do it because silver's
not going to be around to help me with sammy.

172
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,790
How about brenda?

173
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,550
She has a show that night.

174
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,840
Sammy's dad,does he ever take him?

175
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,060
What?

176
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,230
Sammy's dad. Did I... did
I say something wrong?

177
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,960
No. No,it's fine.

178
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,500
Um... he just... he doesn't live here.

179
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,420
Where does he live?

180
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,000
All over kind of.

181
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,980
Yeah,he's,uh,he's a do-gooder.

182
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,730
He's actually halfway across the
world right now doing charity work.

183
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,990
- Impressive.
- Yeah.

184
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,030
- Well,maybe we can do sunday,okay?
- Okay.

185
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,010
I'll see what I can do.
- Great.

186
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,520
Hey,annie,I haven't seen you around.

187
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,580
I've been around.

188
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,140
Busy with the play.

189
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,670
So how's naomi?

190
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,050
Uh,just a lot of really intense
stuff going on with her family.

191
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,250
Yeah. Yeah,it seemed like it.

192
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,780
So are you guys like...?

193
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,570
No,no,no. No,uh...

194
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,290
she was just flipping out and
I know how to deal with her.

195
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,090
- Right.
- What about you and ty?

196
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,340
What's up with that whole...?

197
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,460
Ah... nothing really.

198
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,140
Well,I had a lot of fun hanging
out with you the other night.

199
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,270
Me,too.

200
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,680
Well,good. Do you want
to maybe do that again?

201
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,070
Like thursday?

202
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:59,510
Uh,thursday night I
have nothing going on.

203
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,670
uh,cool.

204
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,915
Well,I'm with my brother
all afternoon,so you want

205
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,930
to just meet at the peach
pit like around 6:00?

206
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,640
Yeah. Cool. See you then.

207
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,060
Awesome.

208

211
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,550
So,the other night,I left
without saying good-bye.

212
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,970
I'm sorry about that.

213
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,410
Oh,no,it's no big deal.

214
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,570
Well,I think it's a big deal 'cause
I didn't get to hang out with you.

215
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,390
Anyway.

216
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,460
vampire weekend's playing
this secret show at

217
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:52,420
the avalon and my cousin
got me vip tickets.

218
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,770
It's thursday.

219
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,260
You want to go?

220
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,570
Oh,I can'T.

221
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,040
I have plans.

222
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,420
Okay.

223
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,950
Uh,is it like a group hang?

224
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,660
'Cause I don't have to go to the show.

225
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,330
My cousin's in the music biz
and hooks me up all the time.

226
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,450
Um,it's-it's not really a group hang.

227
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,590
It's more of a
one-on-one kind of thing.

228
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,060
Got it.

229
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,170
I'll see you around.

230
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,760
Silver... hey,hey,silver.

231
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,440
Can I talk to you?

232
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,170
Headphones.

233
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,960
You have a nanosecond.

234
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,850
Please don't blog about my dad's affair.

235
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,450
You thought my family
problems were gossip.

236
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,570
Why shouldn't I treat
yours the same way?

237
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,970
Look,I've said it before,but
I'll say it again- I'm so sorry.

238
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,290
I'm so sorry,okay?

239
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,420
Because I get it now.

240
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,070
I know what you were going through.

241
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,750
What I did was really messed up.

242
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,950
Yeah,it was really messed up.

243
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,040
no,stop.

244
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,760
My ears are bleeding.

245
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,460
You have no passion,girls.

246
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,170
You got to sing like
your privates are on fire.

247
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,910
For god's sake.

248
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:28,980
Just because you're a bunch of rich
brats doesn't mean you can't have angst.

249
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,720
Channel it.

250
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,330
This is a song about your mother.

251
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,560
She's been lying to you about
sex,and it pisses you off.

252
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,730
You're all teenagers,so I
know you hate your mothers.

253
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,220
I hated mine.

254
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,860
Use the anger.

255
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,180
I will show you how it's done.

256
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,310
- Grandma,maybe I...
- annie,I'm not your grandmother here.

257
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,450
I'm the director.

258
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,750
Everyone..

259
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,910
（这老太太的歌喉... orz！）

260
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,070
you've got to move from the
hips and claim the stage!

261
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:33,410
Dad,you know how very much I love
grandma,and it was a nice idea.

262
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,740
But you have to,have to find
a new director for the musical.

263
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,100
I cannot replace her.

264
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,520
You have to,okay?

265
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,910
Yes,you can. She...

266
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:47,030
she makes me do these crazy heavy
breathing exercises all the way to school.

267
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,530
And she's so embarrassing.

268
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,060
Sweetheart,just one more week.

269
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,830
There you are,harry.

270
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,020
Excuse me,darling.

271
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,080
When you have a moment,I need to
go over the theater budget with you.

272
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,590
The lights need new gels and
the costumes are not up to par.

273
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,670
Is that coffee on your tie?

274
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,470
What?

275
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,460
Great.

276
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,600
You're seriously arguing with me?

277
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,520
Uh,hello.

278
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,520
- My mother...
- saw the whole thing.

279
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,650
Hey,now you know how annie
feels having you here.

280
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,370
You know people in the
entertainmed inustry,right?

281
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,280
Anybody who might be
able to direct a musical?

282
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,930
I think I might know someone uh,here.

283
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,390
Thanks.

284
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,880
You caddied at a country club in
wichita,cut grass,shoveled snow...

285
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,090
And this would be your first real job?

286
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,550
Yes,sir.

287
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,030
- You go to west beverly?
- Yes,sir.

288
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,400
I once hired a kid from west beverly.

289
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,750
A long time ago.

290
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,200
He was a good,good egg.

291
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,890
Tell you what,I'll try you out.

292
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,530
You don't mess up,you got the job.

293
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,690
Thank you,sir.

294
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,620
Stop calling me sir. " The name is nat. "

295
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,280
Thanks,nat.

296
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,900
Mom?

297
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,660
Like to introduce you to somebody.

298
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,560
This is brenda walsh,a west beverly
alum and a very big fan of yours.

299
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,580
Really?

300
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,970
Well,it's nice to meet you.

301
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,190
It's an honor to meet you.

302
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,640
I've seen every one of your films.

303
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,090
Not every film.

304
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,940
There were some real
stinkers in the '80s.

305
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,630
Well,you were wonderful in all of them.

306
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,500
Also I saw your hedda
gabler at the ahmanson.

307
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,760
That's the greatest part
ever written for a woman.

308
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,890
I got to play her.

309
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,870
Not as well as you,of course.

310
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,870
Oh,you're an actor.

311
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,790
Yes.

312
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,690
Mom,opening night is around the corner.

313
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,970
There's a lot of work left.

314
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,380
So I thought you could use some
help,and brenda offered to assist.

315
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,320
I thought I was handling
this all rather well.

316
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,840
Oh,well,I've seen the original
production of spring awakening.

317
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,900
And I always think it helps
to have an extra pair of eyes.

318
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,500
Wonderful.

319
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,770
Fine.

320
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,310
Great.

321
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,390
all right,explain to me,why
didn't you say yes to ty?

322
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,910
I mean,it's vampire weekend.

323
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,280
It's a secret show.

324
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,300
It's ty collins.

325
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,650
Ethan asked me out.

326
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,070
No.

327
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,160
No ethan.

328
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,510
What is wrong with you. He's off limits.

329
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,420
Ethan and naomi are over.

330
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,510
They are never over.

331
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,270
Let me explain something to you.

332
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,890
Naomi and ethan have this thing,right?

333
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,730
It's like they're in this
bubble- this impenetrable bubble.

334
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,470
- A bubble?
- And no matter how hard you try

335
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,900
you can't get in and
you don't want to get in.

336
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,460
Trust me,I stand beside
the bubble and I'm scared.

337
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,420
Well,the bubble has popped.

338
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,840
No,no,you see,you just think it has.

339
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,210
Silver,I am going out with ethan
and you cannot talk me out of it.

340
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,900
And I'm not scared.

341
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,550
I'm going to buy you a box of tissues.

342
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,840
So... what can I get you ladies?

343
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,550
Wait,you're working here?

344
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,880
Yeah.

345
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,740
Are you trying to make me
look bad with mom and dad?

346
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,940
No,I'm trying to make me look good.

347
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,940
I've been messing up since
I got here,so,you know,

348
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,880
I'm trying to do something
a little more responsible.

349
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,000
kiss ass.

350
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,330
Hey,you shouldn't be talking.

351
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,410
So can I get you anything?

352
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,880
The digital proof is in.

353
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,790
Naomi!

354
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,590
Come take a look at this.

355
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,290
I think I'm going to order 500 more.

356
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,450
At least. I think you look beautiful.

357
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,740
Thank you.

358
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,220
Gross. I look terrible.

359
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,760
Well,you've been outvoted,kiddo,'cause
jen likes that one,too.

360
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,170
I think you look great,honey.

361
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,300
Great?I look high.

362
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,590
No,you don'T.Were you high?

363
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,670
oh,that's the office calling.

364
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:10,030
Give me a second. Yeah,I'll
be there at 8:00.

365
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,710
Outside's in control... that's funny.

366
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,660
You're home late.

367
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,700
Uh,yeah,I got a job at the peach pit.

368
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,940
What?W-when did that happen?

369
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,940
Just today.

370
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,210
They said they needed help.

371
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,560
And,dad,you know girls in beverly hills.

372
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,550
They like expensive stuff
and expensive places.

373
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,970
Yes,they do.

374
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,100
I want to roll in style.

375
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,510
Maybe one day get a nicer car.

376
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,830
No... no offense.

377
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,610
None taken. It is a piece of crap.

378
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,320
yeah.

379
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:54,270
Dixon... having a job,good thing,but I wish
you would've discussed it with us first.

380
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,530
You guys don't want me to take it?

381
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,370
No,you can. You can.

382
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:02,760
Uh,but I don't want it to interfere with
your schoolwork or lacrosse practice.

383
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:03,990
It won'T.

384
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,790
Mom,I'll be right down. I'm
just saying good-bye to dad.

385
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,600
Bon ami beverly hills,this is gail.

386
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,630
How can I help you?

387
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,160
Hello?Hello?

388
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,560
*********

389
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,730
again All right,all right,focus.

390
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,360
All right. Okay.

391
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,160
Which organ produces bile?

392
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,850
the pancreas.

393
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,340
Liver.

394
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,670
All right,name the three
classes of digestive enzymes.

395
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,000
I know this one. I know this one,um...

396
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:15,000
lipases,uh,amylases and... and,um...

397
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,040
and?

398
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,770
And I'll study again after work.

399
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,890
those dimples are not going
to get you into harvard.

400
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,420
I think mrs. Schwartz is
going to give us a pop quiz.

401
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,810
I'm gonna study after work.

402
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,960
I promise. I promise. I'm sorry.

403
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,950
Ethan,I'm freaking out.

404
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,200
Naomi,now is not a good time,okay?

405
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,430
Why?What's going on?

406
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,190
It's steven.

407
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,185
I told my mom that I'm
watching him so she could have

408
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:51,120
some time to herself and
he's just having a bad day.

409
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,510
That's all right. Let me help you.

410
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,730
We have a new cleaning
service and I forgot

411
00:20:03,731 --> 00:20:05,230
to tell him not to touch the furniture.

412
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,020
He's been rearranging it all afternoon.

413
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,715
I've tried everything that usually works

414
00:20:08,716 --> 00:20:10,290
to get him to change
his focus but nothing,

415
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,410
and I really need him to
stop before my mom gets home.

416
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:16,680
Hey,it's all right. I'm
here. Okay?I'll help.

417
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,780
Hey,steven.

418
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,380
Hey,man. Naomi came to see
you. How cool is that,huh?

419
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,650
The couch is in the wrong place.

420
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,640
Oh,I can see that. You
want me to help you out?

421
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,830
No.

422
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,420
- I got it.
- Okay.

423
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,545
Well,you know what?I
was actually hoping maybe

424
00:20:29,546 --> 00:20:31,530
we could pop some
popcorn and watch a movie.

425
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,860
What do you think about that?

426
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,960
I came all the way from
my house just for you.

427
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,200
Oh,it sounds
good,right?You love popcorn.

428
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,170
I like popcorn,with butter.

429
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,790
A stick of butter,two teaspoons
of salt and a pinch of pepper.

430
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,820
That's perfect.

431
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,635
That's exactly how I
like mine,but we need

432
00:20:45,636 --> 00:20:47,310
the couch to sit on to
watch the movie,okay?

433
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,840
So why don't you come with
me and we'll get some popcorn.

434
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,440
Hold my hand. Here we go. Okay.

435
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,070
annie,your posture is horrid!

436
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,730
Pull your shoulders back.

437
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,340
you're singing from the throat.

438
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,940
Annie,what is wrong with you today?

439
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,510
- Okay,guys,how about we take five?
- thank you

440
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,290
Hey,dixon.

441
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,310
Hey,what's up,man?

442
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,380
Uh,so look,my dad's trip
got cut short,which means,

443
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,650
I need the money by the end of
next week,and I got the estimate.

444
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,180
It's $500.

445
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,730
Are you serious?

446
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,770
We can still go through
insurance,if you want.

447
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,470
No,no,no,no,no,no.

448
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,980
Um... I'll get you the money,man.

449
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,750
I'll just pick up some
extra shifts,you know?

450
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,620
Okay.

451
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,600
Yeah,yeah. All right,cool,man.

452
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,260
Annie!

453
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,740
You're singing from the throat.

454
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,330
I need diaphragm.

455
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,580
Annie,what is wrong with you today?

456
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,500
I always learn a lot watching
my rehearsals on tape.

457
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,810
Helps me tweak things.

458
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,530
Like did you notice that jill
was off-key in the second verse?

459
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,950
And adriana,she needs some refocusing.

460
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,430
You know,brenda,that...
was very helpful.

461
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,510
Eye-opening.

462
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,120
I'm gonna go talk to
her. I know where she works.

463
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,280
You really want to do that?

464
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,770
It's my family. I can't just
sit back and do nothing.

465
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,560
I just think there
might be a better way.

466
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,120
And what way is that?

467
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,940
Did you like when your
parents got divorced?

468
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,470
You would have stopped it if
you could have,wouldn't you?

469
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,500
I mean,look what happened to silver and
her mom- their whole lives fell apart.

470
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,890
What are you gonna say to her?

471
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm gonna tell the bitch to stop sleeping
with my dad and back the hell off.

472
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,760
My dad's obviously going through a mid-life
crisis and she's probably just some slut.

473
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,280
If I can get her to leave him,then
everything will go back to the way it was.

474
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,740
But I need your help.

475
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,140
Will you please go with me?

476
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,550
yeah. I'll go.

477
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:21,420
well. That's your fourth dr. Pepper.

478
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,240
How late is ethan?

479
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,780
Half an hour.

480
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,220
Did you call him?

481
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,310
Not answering.

482
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,080
Maybe he forgot.

483
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,230
That really doesn't make me feel better.

484
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,820
oh,crap.

485
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,750
Hey,dixon,can I grab
a coffee to go,please?

486
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,930
- Yeah,yeah. Yeah,yeah.
- Thanks,man.

487
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,800
So... these were your plans?

488
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,440
I'm waiting for someone.

489
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,970
Right.

490
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,950
I wellhope you have a good time.

491
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,560
- coffee?
- Thanks,man.

492
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,930
Thank you.

493
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,360
I am such a ginormous idiot.

494
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,480
Yes,you are.

495
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,440
He's a pretty good tipper.

496
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,590
Ty is cool and sweet and
he really likes me and

497
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:22,290
I'm sitting here waiting
for a guy I might not get.

498
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,760
A guy in a bubble.

499
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,410
An impenetrable bubble.

500
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:28,890
Look,annie,you're holding on to a crush

501
00:24:28,891 --> 00:24:32,290
you had on ethan,what,like
two years ago.

502
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,920
You need to go for the guy who treats
you good,not the one who gives you grief.

503
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,970
Yo,willie!Burgers for
table five,man. Come on.

504
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,850
can't make it,so sorry explain later

505
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,070
yeah.

506
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,810
Lots of grief.

507
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,450
thanks for helping.

508
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,510
The kids can play it,but
they can't arrange.

509
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,730
Sure,sure. I would add a little
percussion to the bridge here.

510
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,040
That sounds great.

511
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,440
So... do you want to play with the band?

512
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,940
I was hoping for a fuller sound.

513
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,580
Yeah,I don't think so.

514
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:21,160
um... by the way,kelly asked me if I could
babysit on sunday and I don't think I can.

515
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,050
I have a lot of catch-up
work to do with this.

516
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,690
All right. No worries.

517
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,510
Do you know sammy's dad?

518
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,220
I do.

519
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,260
He sounds like a cool guy.

520
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,480
Traveling the world
and,uh... helping people.

521
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,510
You know,I don't really feel comfortable
talking about kelly's personal life.

522
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,550
If you have questions,you
should just ask her.

523
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,120
Yeah. No,you're... you're right.

524
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,560
Should I have questions?

525
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,770
There's just a long history there.

526
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,370
you want me to go in there with you?

527
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,810
no.

528
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,590
Just wait here.

529
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,660
I'll be here.

530
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,440
we're closing in ten minutes.

531
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,500
are you gail?

532
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,690
hi,naomi.

533
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,890
You know who I am.

534
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,500
Of course.

535
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,410
Why are you here?You're
supposed to be in denver.

536
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,920
Why aren't you in denver?

537
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,870
I just moved here.

538
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,230
- Naomi,I...
- you know what,stop. Just stop.

539
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,360
Leave us alone.

540
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,230
Leave my dad alone,leave
our family alone.

541
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,220
Go away- my dad
doesn't love you.

542
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,150
You're just a fling.

543
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,310
I'm gonna lock the door for a minute.

544
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,740
Do you want some water or something?

545
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,650
No,I don't want any water,and I don't
want to be locked in here with you.

546
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,960
I want you out of our lives.

547
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:13,150
Why don't you go after
someone who's single?Try that.

548
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:16,400
I've asked myself that
same question so many times.

549
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,140
There are some things that don't
make sense just because they don'T.

550
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,720
I guess somehow it's worth it to me.

551
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,500
Oh,really?

552
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,380
Why might that be?

553
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,640
Because I love him.

554
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,670
Oh,my god,I've heard enough!

555
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:38,430
That's the address to my beach house.

556
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,060
Your break's over in five minutes,dixon.

557
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,940
I don't care about the same stuff
kids in beverly hills care about.

558
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,570
Hip nightclubs.

559
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,580
Trendy purses.

560
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,340
I just like doing my own thing.

561
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:58,260
So,you're trying not to fit in?

562
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,130
I just like being different.

563
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,970
It's how I'm made,you know what I mean?

564
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,430
Do i know what you mean?

565
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,040
I'm a black kid living
with a white family.

566
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,150
Doesn't get more different than that.

567
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,770
Right.

568
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,560
Is that weird?

569
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,960
You know,they're my
family,and I love them.

570
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,150
They don't care that I'm black.

571
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,750
I don't care that they're white.

572
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,840
But,you know,sometimes,like,when
we're eating dinner

573
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,400
or if we're talking about
something or even laughing,

574
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,820
then just for a split second...
I feel like I don't fit in.

575
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,700
Then,just like that,the
feeling goes away,

576
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:43,470
- but...
- somehow,it's still there.

577
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,430
Yeah.

578
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:50,010
So,when are you gonna ask me out?

579
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,180
maybe I don't want to ask you out.

580
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,070
Yeah,you do.

581
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,550
Oh,you're so sure?

582
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,670
Uh-huh... I bet you that you do.

583
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,470
Wait... that means if I do ask
you out,then I'll lose the bet.

584
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:06,020
Oh,there's no losers here.

585
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,200
all right,I like the way you think.

586
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,260
Dad said you're quitting the play.

587
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,310
Oh,well,I couldn't work under
those conditions anymore.

588
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,790
The acoustics in that
auditorium are atrocious.

589
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:32,860
And the stage is literally falling apart

590
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:37,930
well... thank you so
much for all your help.

591
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,750
You're welcome,darling.

592
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,930
You're in good hands with brenda.

593
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,650
Annie?

594
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,010
You are doing a wonderful
job in the musical.

595
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,120
You are very talented.

596
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,990
Thank you,grandma.

597
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,750
Mom.

598
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,540
I went to see gail.

599
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,530
I talked to her.

600
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,240
Why would you do that?

601
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,890
Because I want her out of our lives.

602
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,980
You have no business getting involved.

603
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,490
Mom,it's not just a casual
fling with her and dad.

604
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,600
He's moving her into the beach house.

605
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,960
Dad lied.

606
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,410
What?

607
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,790
- Mom...
- no.

608
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,960
I'm sorry.

609
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,990
Oh,god.

610
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,380
No.

611
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,880
hey,teach.

612
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,050
you look tired.

613
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,230
up all night thinking about me?

614
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,910
Uh... yeah,I wish.

615
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,480
No,I was... up studying bio.

616
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:21,120
All right,everybody,let's
focus. We got tests coming out.

617
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,160
- Test?
- Yeah.

618
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,710
Bio's tomorrow.

619
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:29,140
Flannery o'connor short stories today.

620
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,310
no no no

621
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,360
Annie.

622
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,100
Hey,annie,listen,I am so
sorry about standing you up.

623
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,850
- This whole thing with my brother...
- don't worry about it.

624
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,020
It's not like it was a
date or anything,right?

625
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,640
I got to go.

626
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:02,200
So,do you think you could score some tickets
for the sea wolf concert this weekend?

627
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,600
I heard they're playing spaceland.

628
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,930
- Yeah,I have tickets for that show.
- Cool.

629
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,030
I'm already going with someone else.

630
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,090
later.

631
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,820
So,I can't do pizza on sunday.

632
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,980
I just can't get a
sitter- everybody's busy.

633
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,430
Okay.

634
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,860
What's the matter?

635
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,790
look,I don't know what the story
is with you and sammy's dad.

636
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:34,760
It just feels like there's
unfinished business.

637
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,900
And what would give you that idea?

638
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,510
Well,I was talking to brenda,and...

639
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,450
wait,wait- you were
talking to brenda about me?

640
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,860
I'm just trying to get to know you.

641
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,740
Look,kelly,I just want you to
feel like you can talk me,you know,

642
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:54,100
like you can tell me anything,and if there
is something going on with you and your ex,

643
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,860
then... I'm a big
boy... I can handle it.

644
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,160
there's nothing going
on with me and my ex.

645
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,240
Brenda.

646
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,610
Uh,what did you say to ryan?

647
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,850
- About what?
- About me.

648
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,140
Not much.

649
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,650
You shouldn't have said anything.

650
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,590
Okay,kelly,any guy that dates you
is gonna have questions about him.

651
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,580
You should just get your story straight.

652
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,770
My story is straight.

653
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,460
You know,you get really emotional
when you talk about this.

654
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,110
I wonder why that is.

655
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,320
What are you saying?

656
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,700
I'm saying that you still
have feelings for him.

657
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,620
Of course I still have feelings
for him- he's my son's father.

658
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,380
Kelly,come on,you know
there's more to it than that.

659
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,400
No,there isn'T.Because it can't be;

660
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,440
because he's not here,and I deserve
to be with somebody and be happy.

661
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,120
Oh,give me a break.

662
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,910
You are never gonna be
happy with somebody else,

663
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,270
because you're still in love
with dylan,and you know it.

664
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,710
dad,what are you doing here?

665
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,190
Hear they have great coffee.

666
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,460
Well,you came to the right spot.

667
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:23,070
Mr. Matthews told me that you got an
incomplete on the test you took today.

668
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,090
I'll make it up.

669
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,930
Look,dixon,I like
that you have this job,

670
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,910
b5ut I told you I didn't want it
to interfere with your schoolwork.

671
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,260
Dad,look,I-I need this
job right now,you know?

672
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,620
After next week,you know,I'll
cut down on a few shifts,but...

673
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,480
why next week?

674
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,090
Um... because I,uh...

675
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,900
accidentally knocked
off someone's side mirror

676
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,800
when I was parking the van and
wanted to pay for it myself.

677
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,160
You should've come to me.

678
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,750
But,dad...

679
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,550
your insurance would've went up,right?

680
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:58,200
And I heard you and mom
talking about money problems.

681
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,160
So I wanted to take care of this myself.

682
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,470
I don't know many other kids
who would've gotten a job.

683
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,440
I mean,hell,I never did.

684
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,310
You're already ahead of me.

685
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:13,600
Look,uh,I'll-I'll pay for it
now,and you can pay me back in time.

686
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,650
- How's that sound?
- Thanks,dad.

687
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,620
Leave a tip.

688
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,390
I got your tip: Don't
get any more bad grades.

689
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,730
Do you like it?

690
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,790
Oh,I love it.

691
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,000
I think I'm gonna wear it to school.

692
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,750
Oh,you would not. I dare you.

693
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:43,820
Come on,get into the video.

694
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,680
All right,all right,all right.

695
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,185
you look pretty good with
a monkey on your head.

696
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,810
Oh,yeah?Well,you look good
with a tiger on your head.

697
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,580
Thank you,thank you.

698
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,230
This is the best day ever.

699
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,690
I love you,ethan ward.

700
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,630
I love you.

701
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,100
You're not cotton candy.

702
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,750
yo,dix.

703
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,830
Here.

704
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,460
Thanks for helping me out,man.

705
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,680
No worries.

706
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,330
So,listen,my dad has a
hookup with the lakers.

707
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,100
We got courtside tickets,but
my buddy bailed on me.

708
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,390
So you interested?

709
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,520
- For real?
- Yeah.

710
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,930
Kobe?

711
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,400
Hell,yeah,I want to see the lakers,man!

712
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:34,950
you hit that guy's car,almost got him in
trouble,and then he asks you to a game?

713
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,950
It's nothing.

714
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,780
I've seen guys fistfight,and then
five minutes later,they're hanging out.

715
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,900
that's crazy.

716
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,830
Yeah,you know,guys aren't like girls.

717
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,370
We don't hold grudges.

718
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,500
Life is way too short.

719
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,820
Look...

720
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,950
I'm not gonna post anything
on my blog about you.

721
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,840
Okay.

722
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,370
Thank you.

723
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,440
Just thought you should know.

724
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,320
Okay.

725
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,690
So see you around?

726
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,280
Yeah. See you.

727
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,020
all right,man,so I'll
just catch you later.

728
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:27,970
What's this?

729
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,940
Snickerdoodles. They're apology cookies.

730
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,320
When I do something screwed up,I bake.

731
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,750
Uh,you know,just forget about it.

732
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,310
I can't forget about it.

733
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,900
I'm an idiot,ty.

734
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,960
I like you. I want to hang out with you.

735
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,440
Well,you really haven't
been acting like it.

736
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,400
I know. I know I messed up.

737
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:46,330
And-and I am so hoping that
I'm not too late to fix it.

738
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,850
Am I too late?

739
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:50,010
Look,I-I spent the whole
night making you these cookies.

740
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,110
So eat a snickerdoodle;
they're really good.

741
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,120
I really don't think
cookies are gonna do it.

742
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,850
You haven't tasted one yet.

743
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,050
Annie,I don't have to. I just...

744
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,170
That's way better than cookies.

745
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,970
I'm sorry. Really.

746
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,410
You know,if you weren't
so freakin' adorable,

747
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,670
I wouldn't even be having
this conversation right now.

748
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:25,060
- Can we start over?
- Okay Yeah.

749
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,100
So you want to go out this weekend?

750
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,350
Yes,I would.

751
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,600
I remember that hat.

752
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:43,810
L.A. Zoo.

753
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,400
Still cute.

754
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,490
How you doing?

755
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,240
I'm all right.

756
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,040
I realized,can't always get what I want.

757
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,640
no matter how bad I want it.

758
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,560
Can't fix my parents' marriage.

759
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,740
Can't make my dad love my mom.

760
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,480
I'm sorry.

761
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:09,130
You've been wonderful
through all this craziness.

762
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,550
Thank you.

763
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,270
Think we can start over?

764
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,960
What do you mean?

765
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:19,110
all I know is I miss those
two people who went to the zoo

766
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,470
and ate cotton candy and
were silly and happy together.

767
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,960
so you saying... you
want to get back together?

768
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:35,320
I'm saying take it day
by day,see what happens.

769
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,300
I can do that.

770
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,470
Come here.

771
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,630
- so cute.
- Yeah?Still cute?

772
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,180
Still cute.
