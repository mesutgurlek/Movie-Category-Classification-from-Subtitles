1
00:00:09,403 --> 00:00:12,967
You won't admit you love me,

2
00:00:12,968 --> 00:00:14,533
and so,

3
00:00:14,534 --> 00:00:17,240
how am I ever

4
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:18,918
to know?

5
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:21,811
You always tell me,

6
00:00:21,812 --> 00:00:25,812
"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps",

7
00:00:26,303 --> 00:00:30,303
"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps".

8
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:46,298
Hi, it's Steve.

9
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:50,299
Hi, Steve.

10
00:00:57,645 --> 00:01:00,999
- So what was the pause for?
- I don't know, I panicked.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,559
So what did you do after the pause?

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,005
Well, the pause got out of control.

13
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:10,006
- You kept pausing?
- It got away from me.

14
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:22,799
At first, it was just a normal pause.

15
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,960
- A collect your thoughts pause.
- Perfectly acceptable.

16
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:29,159
But then, then I
thought about the pause.

17
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,999
And now, the pause
is too long to ignore.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,520
The pause is like a whole third
person in the conversation.

19
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:35,944
- Exactly.
- Only not saying much.

20
00:01:35,945 --> 00:01:36,817
Right.

21
00:01:36,818 --> 00:01:40,818
Like Patrick.

22
00:01:55,169 --> 00:01:58,066
Now, I'm a rabbit in headlights.

23
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:01,094
This pause is just
expanding, and expanding,

24
00:02:01,095 --> 00:02:04,182
like this out of control thing.

25
00:02:04,183 --> 00:02:06,179
- Like in "The Blob".
- Yes, like in... what?

26
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,111
"The Blob", 50's horror movie.

27
00:02:08,112 --> 00:02:12,084
This blob comes from outer space,
and just keeps growing and growing.

28
00:02:12,085 --> 00:02:13,259
Right... thanks.

29
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,260
It eats people, and in the end
they kill it by electrocution.

30
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:22,830
But that bit doesn't really apply here.

31
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:23,704
Right. Anyway,

32
00:02:23,705 --> 00:02:26,424
I've got the phone in my
hand, and I'm saying nothing.

33
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:26,811
Right.

34
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:29,290
No, nothing. Nothing
is coming into my head.

35
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,279
I have forgotten, in one
moment of embarassment,

36
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,388
the entire English language.

37
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:37,389
- I hate it when that happens.
- I can feal my hair sweating.

38
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,730
Oh god yeah, and there's always this puppy
trapped in a car that you've got to rescue.

39
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:45,986
What?

40
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:49,633
Oh sorry, I'm back on the Blob there.

41
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:53,634
There's always this puppy
trapped in a car in those movies.

42
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,745
Ok, sorry.

43
00:02:54,746 --> 00:02:58,746
- So the Blob from space is the pause?
- Yeah.

44
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,679
What exactly is the puppy?

45
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:06,457
Love.

46
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,275
What?

47
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:08,816
Well, obviously the
puppy represents love.

48
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:11,198
You've got to rescue the puppy of love,

49
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,199
from the car of conversation.

50
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:20,713
That's right, isn't it Jeff?

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,626
Steve?

52
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:28,845
Hi, it's Steve.

53
00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:30,664
You said.

54
00:03:30,665 --> 00:03:34,665
Right, right, of course.

55
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:39,249
There seems to be a fault on this line.

56
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,215
- Brilliant!
- Very good.

57
00:03:42,216 --> 00:03:44,965
A fault?

58
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:47,186
You couldn't hear me
talking then, could you?

59
00:03:47,187 --> 00:03:50,745
I could hear you breathing.

60
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:52,519
That wasn't me.

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,052
Wasn't you?

62
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:58,053
No, no. Maybe there's
someone behind you.

63
00:04:00,996 --> 00:04:02,092
I'm alone.

64
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:04,746
Look...

65
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:07,145
...I was just wondering, would
you like to meet up some time,

66
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:10,320
or alternatively I could never
phone you again and emigrate.

67
00:04:10,321 --> 00:04:12,853
How about tomorrow night?

68
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:13,720
Great.

69
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:16,541
I suggest New Zealand.

70
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:18,645
Alright.

71
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:20,671
Kidding...

72
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:21,865
Right!

73
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:25,283
Why don't you come around
to my place, I'll cook.

74
00:04:25,284 --> 00:04:28,023
- You said what?
- I'll cook!

75
00:04:28,024 --> 00:04:30,612
It just came out of my mouth.

76
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:34,613
You know what "I'll cook"
says? It says, "let's have sex!"

77
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,799
No, that would be "come and
spend the night with me".

78
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,983
"Come and spend the night
with me" says "let's have sex".

79
00:04:40,984 --> 00:04:44,385
"I'll cook" says "let's
have sex, and I'll cater".

80
00:04:44,386 --> 00:04:48,199
Sally...

81
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,800
Susan, you are offering this man
food and sex in the same place.

82
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:54,303
If there's something to read
in the loo he may never leave.

83
00:04:54,304 --> 00:04:58,304
Men don't expect sex just
because you offer to cook.

84
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:02,651
Ok. Have you thought
through youre foreplay yet?

85
00:05:03,562 --> 00:05:06,747
They know about that?

86
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:08,512
What do you mean, foreplay?

87
00:05:08,513 --> 00:05:09,781
What do you think I mean?

88
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:13,782
I mean, when exactly do
you take your socks off?

89
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:17,431
My advice is to get them
off right after your shoes,

90
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:19,230
and before your trousers.

91
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,616
That's the sock gap.

92
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:24,617
Miss it, and suddenly
you're a naked man in socks.

93
00:05:27,046 --> 00:05:29,614
No self-respecting woman will ever let

94
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:33,615
a naked man in socks do
the squelchy with her.

95
00:05:34,731 --> 00:05:38,731
That's your foreplay tip? Socks?

96
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:44,271
Many men have fallen through
the sock gap, Patrick.

97
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:48,267
Under the sexual arena
of earthly delight,

98
00:05:48,268 --> 00:05:51,774
there lurks a deadly pit of socks.

99
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:55,775
Ok, foreplay tip number 2.

100
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,841
Whoever you normally
fantasize about during sex,

101
00:05:59,842 --> 00:06:02,498
start calling them Susan.

102
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:06,499
With you, it's always
Mariella Frostrup, right?

103
00:06:07,412 --> 00:06:09,999
Well, call her Susan Frostrup.

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,089
That way, when you're in bed with Susan,

105
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,991
you won't shout the wrong name
when you've got your eyes shut.

106
00:06:14,992 --> 00:06:17,119
Or you could call her God.

107
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,120
Yes, that will work.

108
00:06:23,185 --> 00:06:27,185
So, is it absolutely necessary
to think about somebody else?

109
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,998
Everybody does.

110
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:31,673
That's why there are so
many celebrity marriages.

111
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:33,907
I'm sorry?

112
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:37,908
If you fantasize about somebody else
during sex, and so does your partner,

113
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:41,146
and those two people that you're
fantasizing about happen to meet

114
00:06:41,147 --> 00:06:44,556
while you're still doing it, they're
bound to feel something, aren't they?

115
00:06:44,557 --> 00:06:48,252
Because they're connecting
on a virtual plane.

116
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:52,134
So, can you imagine what it was
like when Posh first met Beckham.

117
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:55,103
They were the epicenter of a non-stop,

118
00:06:55,104 --> 00:06:59,104
nation-wide virtual shag.

119
00:06:59,312 --> 00:07:01,918
There's no wonder she got pregnant.

120
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,714
When the van comes for
you Jeff, go quietly.

121
00:07:05,715 --> 00:07:07,845
Ok.

122
00:07:07,846 --> 00:07:11,846
So I just popped in for a drink with
Sal, before I get home and start cooking.

123
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:13,894
Wasn't expecting to see you.

124
00:07:13,895 --> 00:07:16,861
- Could I have a word, please?
- Sure.

125
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:18,399
You guys ok for drinks?

126
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,887
Yeah, sure.

127
00:07:20,888 --> 00:07:24,888
Can I just clarify, when I
say dinner, I mean dinner.

128
00:07:25,048 --> 00:07:27,567
I know that. Absolutely.

129
00:07:27,568 --> 00:07:29,288
Plain ordinary cooking.

130
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:33,289
I wasn't expecting a fish course.

131
00:07:35,698 --> 00:07:38,247
So you can stop worrying
about your socks.

132
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:42,056
I think they just melted.

133
00:07:42,057 --> 00:07:43,427
A motor show.

134
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:46,943
Yeah, I thought we could go
together. You like cars right?

135
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:50,932
Everybody likes cars.

136
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:54,812
- Would this be a date?
- I'm sorry?

137
00:07:54,813 --> 00:07:58,419
I'd love to go, Patrick,
but strictly as your friend.

138
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,287
What do you mean, friend, exactly?

139
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:03,661
I wouldn't be your date.

140
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:06,111
I'd be your friend.

141
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,997
No, sorry, still not with you.

142
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:10,842
Ok, let's take it slowly.

143
00:08:10,843 --> 00:08:12,672
What do you call people,

144
00:08:12,673 --> 00:08:16,297
you go out with, but you
don't try to sleep with?

145
00:08:16,298 --> 00:08:20,298
Men.

146
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:21,870
Right.

147
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:23,971
Now, since I'm only a friend date,

148
00:08:23,972 --> 00:08:25,932
do you want to take this ticket back,

149
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:26,805
and get an upgrade?

150
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,574
Hey, no, we can go
as the, friends thing.

151
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,975
I'm never gonna sleep with you, Patrick.

152
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:33,262
Ever, ever, ever.

153
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:37,263
- Ok, thanks.
- See you.

154
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,202
- Looked like a dumping conversation.
- It was.

155
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:44,203
- How did it go?
- She took it ok.

156
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:46,812
Would you consider a naked man in socks?

157
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:50,813
I would consider anything,
except animals and Tories.

158
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:53,993
- Maybe Angus Deayton.
- What?

159
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:56,857
I think Angus could
pull off naked in socks.

160
00:08:56,858 --> 00:09:00,213
Susan, you've got to get
past this Angus thing.

161
00:09:00,214 --> 00:09:03,479
I'm trying! So how's
the Patrick thing going?

162
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,240
- It isn't.
- I told you he wasn't your type.

163
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:07,201
I'm surprised he was ever yours.

164
00:09:07,202 --> 00:09:10,002
What did you see in him? He's so dull.

165
00:09:10,003 --> 00:09:14,003
I need personality, verve, humor.

166
00:09:14,707 --> 00:09:18,600
At least now I know why you
called him "donkey brain".

167
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,723
Actually, I called him "donkey".

168
00:09:20,724 --> 00:09:24,724
Yeah, but I got the point.

169
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:27,837
No, you didn't.

170
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:30,845
What?

171
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:34,846
- You mean, you mean...?
- Some men are born lucky.

172
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:38,266
Some men are born very lucky.

173
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:39,757
What was Patrick born?

174
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:43,502
A tripod.

175
00:09:43,503 --> 00:09:46,232
You let me dump a tripod! You bitch!

176
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:48,462
Oh, come on. You'd
have dumped him anyway.

177
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,079
There are different
levels of dumping, Susan.

178
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,897
There's dumping plain and simple,

179
00:09:52,898 --> 00:09:55,774
and there's dumping afterwards!

180
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:57,117
Excuse me, girls.

181
00:09:57,118 --> 00:10:01,118
Seem to have a bit of a balance problem.

182
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:06,836
- Ok, foreplay tip number 3.
- Please, Jeff. No more.

183
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:10,096
What, you don't think
you need help here?

184
00:10:10,097 --> 00:10:12,636
Susan is no ordinary woman.

185
00:10:12,637 --> 00:10:14,920
I don't think I need the advice
of a man who had a panic attack,

186
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:17,086
at the prospect of sex with her.

187
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:18,848
Listen, do yourself a favor.

188
00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:22,849
When you get to her flat,
check out her remote controls.

189
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,318
Her what?

190
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:27,052
Her remote controls,

191
00:10:27,053 --> 00:10:29,080
TV, video, sound system.

192
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:30,641
Check them out.

193
00:10:30,642 --> 00:10:31,066
Why?

194
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:34,042
- You're talking about Susan's remotes?
- Oh yeah.

195
00:10:34,043 --> 00:10:35,567
- Amazing, isn't it?
- Scary!

196
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,299
Scared me too, I didn't realize
a woman could be that shameless.

197
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,300
So, a motor show you say...

198
00:10:46,576 --> 00:10:50,123
I thought you didn't want to... go?

199
00:10:50,124 --> 00:10:54,124
I didn't realize it
was such a... big one.

200
00:10:56,218 --> 00:11:00,218
She'll be with you in a moment.

201
00:11:00,418 --> 00:11:02,671
What happened to
personality, verve and humor?

202
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:04,990
Sod them! After all the
men I've been out with,

203
00:11:04,991 --> 00:11:08,991
I deserve a full-sized one.

204
00:11:09,438 --> 00:11:13,438
Ok, but I'm not gonna stand here
and watch you humiliate yourself.

205
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,411
- Oh, and just one thing.
- What?

206
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:18,969
Patrick is a Tory.

207
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,251
What?

208
00:11:20,252 --> 00:11:21,909
Here we all are.

209
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,202
I thought I'd find you all here.

210
00:11:25,203 --> 00:11:28,747
- How's my favorite little ex, hmm?
- Fine.

211
00:11:28,748 --> 00:11:31,675
Such a good idea,
staying friends with exes.

212
00:11:31,676 --> 00:11:33,971
Take it from someone who knows.

213
00:11:33,972 --> 00:11:36,066
Friendships, more lasting than love,

214
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:40,067
and more legal than stalking.

215
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:43,230
Everybody, I want you to meet Howard.

216
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,841
- Hi.
- Hi.

217
00:11:45,842 --> 00:11:49,496
Does anyone know if that big ginger bloke
is still working behind the bar here?

218
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:51,542
- Sometimes.
- Excellent.

219
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:54,997
He's an ex of mine, I think
I still owe him a slap.

220
00:11:54,998 --> 00:11:58,685
I'll get the drinks then.

221
00:11:58,686 --> 00:12:01,338
Isn't he just perfect?

222
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:02,405
He's gorgeous!

223
00:12:02,406 --> 00:12:04,430
And tonight he's mine.

224
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:06,953
Jane, isn't he gay?

225
00:12:06,954 --> 00:12:08,159
Fascist!

226
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,160
No, I'm just saying he goes
out with men. Not women, men.

227
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,050
Tada, I'm bisexual. Howard?

228
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:22,753
Now I don't want you to get unduely
excited, but I'm off to cook.

229
00:12:22,754 --> 00:12:23,564
Great.

230
00:12:23,565 --> 00:12:27,565
You can come and watch. In that order.

231
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:31,671
Great.

232
00:12:36,817 --> 00:12:40,191
Susan, Susan...

233
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:43,132
How Tory?

234
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:47,133
Ok, how big?

235
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:53,366
I think we're almost ready.

236
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:56,153
Don't you just love oven timers.

237
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:59,199
You have got an oven. There's
a square thing in the kitchen,

238
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,240
I just put books in it,

239
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:04,241
'til there was a slight fire incident.

240
00:13:21,723 --> 00:13:25,723
Oh, yeah, yes!

241
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:28,053
I'm such a great cook.

242
00:13:28,054 --> 00:13:30,725
Oh, I see, right.

243
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,616
- You okay?
- Yeah, just, um...

244
00:13:33,617 --> 00:13:36,426
Oh, of course. A man, a television.

245
00:13:36,427 --> 00:13:38,167
Better leave you two alone.

246
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:40,746
- Is there anything I can do?
- Just relax.

247
00:13:40,747 --> 00:13:42,845
Shouldn't have gotten you here so early.

248
00:13:42,846 --> 00:13:44,580
But if Sally is going
to humiliate herself,

249
00:13:44,581 --> 00:13:47,670
I'd rather have she had a
smaller audience if possible.

250
00:13:47,671 --> 00:13:51,671
It's my fault, really. I told her
something about Patrick. I shouldn't.

251
00:13:53,368 --> 00:13:55,651
Probably the batteries have run out.

252
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:59,244
Yeah, yeah. I'll just, um...

253
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:01,658
They've also climbed out.

254
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:02,793
I'll have put them in something else.

255
00:14:02,794 --> 00:14:06,775
I'm always running out of batteries.

256
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:09,534
No, these are empty too.

257
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:13,535
Oh hang on, I think I
know where they ended up.

258
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:28,133
There you are.

259
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:31,078
Thanks.

260
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,079
What am I thinking? I've
just bought some new ones!

261
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:39,707
Tada!

262
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,436
You find your batteries
always run out very quickly.

263
00:14:42,437 --> 00:14:45,199
I've never had any complaints.

264
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,949
Sorry?

265
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,950
Nothing.

266
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:54,908
What was it you told Sally about
Patrick that you shouldn't have?

267
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:59,098
Oh, just that my ex is
a very big boy indeed.

268
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:03,099
I'd watch some TV, I'm
gonna jump in the shower.

269
00:15:07,914 --> 00:15:11,834
Think about Blair, think about Blair...

270
00:15:11,835 --> 00:15:14,401
Is this country ready for a president?

271
00:15:14,402 --> 00:15:16,481
- Yeah, I know what you mean.
- Exactly.

272
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:20,482
It worries me that man, the Tories have got
to find a way to save the country from him.

273
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:24,911
Yes, yes I see your point.

274
00:15:24,912 --> 00:15:28,912
You said all Tories should
be drowned in their own vomit.

275
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,983
Doesn't mean I can't
see their point of view.

276
00:15:31,984 --> 00:15:35,139
You know what we need
now? We need Maggie back.

277
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,049
- Oh, dear god.
- What's wrong with good old Maggie?

278
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,288
You can't be against her, can you?

279
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:41,262
Patrick, it'd better be enormous!

280
00:15:41,263 --> 00:15:45,263
What?

281
00:15:45,513 --> 00:15:47,375
The motor show.

282
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:50,090
It'd better be a REALLY BIG motor show.

283
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:52,331
What are you suddenly
bringing up the motor show for?

284
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:54,533
Because I have never

285
00:15:54,534 --> 00:15:58,027
been to a motor show with a Tory.

286
00:15:58,028 --> 00:15:59,360
So it better be a really big,

287
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:02,450
enormous, throbbing motor show.

288
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:06,451
That's all I'm saying.

289
00:16:07,448 --> 00:16:09,681
You know, you're a lot more
fun when you're relaxed.

290
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:12,099
Not as funny, but a lot more fun.

291
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,573
Thank you.

292
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:15,425
What is it about men?

293
00:16:15,426 --> 00:16:17,173
You're supposed to
be the confident ones.

294
00:16:17,174 --> 00:16:19,262
You're supposed to be chasing us.

295
00:16:19,263 --> 00:16:22,563
It takes some of the excitement away,
if we keep having to shout "hurry up!"

296
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,866
Hang on.

297
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:27,044
Yes, first dates are
more stressful for men.

298
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:29,091
For us, it's the unknown.

299
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:31,516
- For us too.
- No.

300
00:16:31,517 --> 00:16:33,786
You know one more thing than we do.

301
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:36,137
What?

302
00:16:36,138 --> 00:16:38,194
You know.

303
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:40,512
I don't.

304
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:42,704
Ok.

305
00:16:42,705 --> 00:16:44,859
On a date, any date,

306
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,672
I'm not saying this date in particular,

307
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,510
the guy is wondering
whether he'll get lucky.

308
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,747
- Or not, that's all he's thinking.
- True.

309
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:56,060
And the woman,

310
00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:58,266
she already knows.

311
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,660
- Also true.
- So you see.

312
00:17:00,661 --> 00:17:04,661
We're dealing with the unknown.

313
00:17:04,712 --> 00:17:08,712
I always thought it was because you
were worried about your equipment.

314
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:10,781
My what?

315
00:17:10,782 --> 00:17:12,623
You know.

316
00:17:12,624 --> 00:17:16,624
If he's gonna fire off
too soon or something.

317
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:21,337
You really are upfront, aren't you.

318
00:17:21,338 --> 00:17:22,569
I mean I, personally,

319
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,880
never had any,

320
00:17:23,881 --> 00:17:27,050
worries about premature,

321
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:28,763
firing.

322
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:32,367
- Just about the unknown.
- Exactly.

323
00:17:32,368 --> 00:17:33,362
Steve.

324
00:17:33,363 --> 00:17:34,381
Yes?

325
00:17:34,382 --> 00:17:38,382
You're definately getting lucky tonight.

326
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:44,953
Just to take the pressure off.

327
00:17:48,803 --> 00:17:52,783
Well, that's great!

328
00:17:52,784 --> 00:17:55,681
That's fantastic.

329
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:58,562
Thank you.

330
00:17:58,563 --> 00:18:00,186
You're welcome.

331
00:18:00,187 --> 00:18:02,611
See, now,

332
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:06,612
I can relax.

333
00:18:06,903 --> 00:18:10,903
Great.

334
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,900
Aren't you gonna swallow?

335
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:21,901
Oh yeah, I'm getting there.

336
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:24,980
Maggie Thatcher, in my opinion...

337
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:27,006
Now listen to this, Patrick,

338
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:31,007
this is the voice of
an oppressed minority.

339
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,556
Maggie Thatcher is
the best prime minister

340
00:18:34,557 --> 00:18:37,059
this country has ever had.

341
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,940
How dare you say that?

342
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:41,001
You're gay, you're on our side!

343
00:18:41,002 --> 00:18:44,201
Actually, Sally, Howard
doesn't think of himself as gay.

344
00:18:44,202 --> 00:18:46,055
Yes I do.

345
00:18:46,056 --> 00:18:47,879
No, there are no homosexuals,

346
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,589
there are just peoplesexuals.

347
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,443
No Jane, there are
definitively homosexuals.

348
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:55,009
Howard, do you want
gay men to be labelled?

349
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,908
Yes, that would be fantastic.

350
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:01,140
Must be a lot easier, being gay.

351
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:05,075
Sex must be a piece
of piss if you're gay.

352
00:19:05,076 --> 00:19:06,418
Why's that?

353
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:09,800
'Couse if you're gay,

354
00:19:09,801 --> 00:19:13,801
if you're gay, masturbation is practice.

355
00:19:17,094 --> 00:19:20,234
You can have a good old
practice on your own,

356
00:19:20,235 --> 00:19:22,707
and when you're ready, when
you've got the hang of it,

357
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,519
you have a go at someone elses.

358
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,109
Piece of piss.

359
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,421
It's a very good point, actually.

360
00:19:28,422 --> 00:19:31,356
No, it's not. It's
homophobic, you stupid queen.

361
00:19:31,357 --> 00:19:34,106
It is not in the least bit homophobic.

362
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:36,985
Hello, there's no such
thing as homophobia,

363
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:39,409
there's just peoplephobia.

364
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:43,410
It's different, it's different
if you're a straight bloke.

365
00:19:43,993 --> 00:19:46,273
When we finally get
our hands on the gear,

366
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:49,169
let me tell you, it's not a drill.

367
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,355
Gays, they've got
their own practice kit,

368
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,332
but you don't get any practice-women.

369
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:57,333
We're supposed to fly these babies
the first time we get in them.

370
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,854
That's not funny.

371
00:20:01,855 --> 00:20:04,030
"Get in them" is not funny.

372
00:20:04,031 --> 00:20:07,854
- Oh, don't be so political correct.
- Typical lefty puritan.

373
00:20:07,855 --> 00:20:09,199
Typical what?

374
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,393
Come the revolution.

375
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:14,394
What revolution? You guys are in
power. We're the revolution now.

376
00:20:14,482 --> 00:20:16,528
No. No, that can't be right.

377
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:19,631
- You're the evil empire.
- No.

378
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:23,632
Yes, like Star Wars, and Patrick
and me are the Rebel Alliance.

379
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:29,763
No.

380
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:32,280
You're not the goodies.
We're the goodies.

381
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:34,259
We're lefties, we're always goodies.

382
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,260
No Sally, you are the
established majority.

383
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,829
Don't say that, you bastard!

384
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,691
You can't call me bastard
anymore, that's oppressive.

385
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:46,692
Aah, you're oppressing me!

386
00:20:47,101 --> 00:20:48,442
You're going to the loo?

387
00:20:48,443 --> 00:20:49,052
Yeah.

388
00:20:49,053 --> 00:20:51,896
Wait and go with Patrick,
there's something I need to know.

389
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:52,894
What?

390
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:56,722
Just wait and go with Patrick!

391
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,806
So what about Jane?

392
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:01,101
- Jane?
- Your ex.

393
00:21:01,102 --> 00:21:03,618
I mean, she's very beautiful.
Hope I can measure up.

394
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:07,619
Hope I can measure up to your ex.

395
00:21:08,816 --> 00:21:11,605
Patrick, oh he's sweet.

396
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:15,413
It's always kind of difficult,
meeting your predecessors, isn't it?

397
00:21:15,414 --> 00:21:18,640
I used to go with this girl years ago,

398
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:21,211
her ex was like this big,

399
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:24,435
muscle-bound god.

400
00:21:24,436 --> 00:21:27,431
I was really intimidated
until she told me that

401
00:21:27,432 --> 00:21:29,665
every time they're in bed together,

402
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:33,666
and he was on his way in, so to speak,

403
00:21:34,387 --> 00:21:38,387
he used to go, "Jeronimo!".

404
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,300
She told me that it
wasn't really a problem.

405
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:45,181
Yes, I remember Patrick
doing something like that.

406
00:21:45,182 --> 00:21:47,661
Really, what?

407
00:21:47,662 --> 00:21:51,326
Every time he was making
an entrance as it were,

408
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:55,327
he'd say, "Just say when".

409
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:10,309
Anyway, that's enough chat.

410
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:13,214
About exes?

411
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:17,215
About anything.

412
00:22:29,602 --> 00:22:32,863
Jane, I hope you don't mind, there's
something I need to get straight.

413
00:22:32,864 --> 00:22:35,337
Not at all, this is much more romantic.

414
00:22:35,338 --> 00:22:37,042
Yeah.

415
00:22:37,043 --> 00:22:41,043
You see, I'm beginning to think
there's a bit of a misunderstanding.

416
00:22:41,274 --> 00:22:44,634
This is not a date.

417
00:22:44,635 --> 00:22:47,448
Oh god!

418
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,769
There has been a
misunderstanding, Howard.

419
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,902
This is a date.

420
00:22:53,903 --> 00:22:56,208
Jane, I'm gay.

421
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,133
No problem, so am I.

422
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:00,425
No, you're not.

423
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:02,212
Well, I'm a little bit gay.

424
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:05,202
- And if you were, that would be 2 problems.
- Homophobe!

425
00:23:05,203 --> 00:23:07,030
No, I'm homosexual.

426
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:09,616
Oh Howard, I know you're a homosexual.

427
00:23:09,617 --> 00:23:13,617
That doesn't mean you don't go out
with women, just like any other man.

428
00:23:15,285 --> 00:23:17,611
Look, look over there. two straight men.

429
00:23:17,612 --> 00:23:19,065
They go out with women.

430
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,043
You don't expect them to go
out with eachother, do you?

431
00:23:21,044 --> 00:23:24,353
Yes of course I do now and
then, if it's convenient.

432
00:23:24,354 --> 00:23:26,271
No, no you don't.

433
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:30,272
I expect they're always nipping
off together for a cuddle.

434
00:23:31,317 --> 00:23:33,739
It's just you that's narrow-minded.

435
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,374
Jane, I am gay.

436
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:39,417
And I've always, always been gay.

437
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,758
I was the sperm at the back, shouting,

438
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,759
"No, don't send me into
that big, scary cave!"

439
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:49,145
I was the only sperm that
had to be chased by the egg.

440
00:23:49,146 --> 00:23:52,279
Don't you get it? I'm gay!

441
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Wow, you certainly seem to
be under that impression.

442
00:23:58,112 --> 00:23:59,918
You like Portillo?

443
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,635
I nearly cried when he lost his suit.

444
00:24:02,636 --> 00:24:05,277
That's illegal.

445
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,606
Hang on.

446
00:24:08,607 --> 00:24:10,610
Don't go yet.

447
00:24:10,611 --> 00:24:14,045
You've got to go with Patrick.

448
00:24:14,046 --> 00:24:16,279
You're weird.

449
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,319
You're weird, you are.

450
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,635
Jeff Murdock, is there
a Jeff Murdock here?

451
00:24:20,636 --> 00:24:21,446
Yes.

452
00:24:21,447 --> 00:24:22,933
Phone call for you.

453
00:24:22,934 --> 00:24:26,934
- Listen.
- Keep away from me.

454
00:24:29,773 --> 00:24:30,601
Hello?

455
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,704
Jeff, it's Steve.

456
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,785
- Steve, how is it going?
- Fine, great.

457
00:24:35,786 --> 00:24:37,452
She's in the bathroom,
doing whatever they do.

458
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:39,878
Things are getting seriously weird here,

459
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,374
let me tell you.

460
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:44,183
That Sally is a really weird person.

461
00:24:44,184 --> 00:24:47,093
Yeah, whatever. Look, I need
you to do something for me.

462
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:47,677
What?

463
00:24:47,678 --> 00:24:51,678
When Patrick goes to the
loo, can you go with him?

464
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:56,801
Jeff? Jeff?

465
00:25:02,028 --> 00:25:04,835
- Can I sit here?
- Sure, no problem.

466
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:08,538
It would be nice to have
someone open-minded at the table.

467
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:12,171
- Someone flexible.
- It's really weird tonight.

468
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:15,052
People are behaving a
little oddly, I must say.

469
00:25:15,053 --> 00:25:17,434
Glad someone else has noticed.

470
00:25:17,435 --> 00:25:19,055
Oh look, Jeff,

471
00:25:19,056 --> 00:25:21,947
Patrick has gone to the loo,

472
00:25:21,948 --> 00:25:23,613
why don't you go with him,

473
00:25:23,614 --> 00:25:27,614
have a bit of a cuddle?

474
00:25:28,115 --> 00:25:32,115
I need you!

475
00:26:38,825 --> 00:26:42,825
- I was just...
- But can it mow the lawn?

476
00:26:44,492 --> 00:26:48,419
I think the next model up comes
with this trimmer attachment.

477
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,420
Do you really?

478
00:26:53,565 --> 00:26:55,937
I've got this feeling you're
getting unrelaxed again.

479
00:26:55,938 --> 00:26:59,259
No, no!

480
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:03,260
Don't worry, I know just the thing.

481
00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:24,255
Now, let's get squelching.

482
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,174
- Mariella!
- Angus!

483
00:27:52,175 --> 00:27:55,500
You look...

484
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:59,501
So do you.

485
00:28:00,883 --> 00:28:02,433
I'm terribly sorry.

486
00:28:02,434 --> 00:28:05,847
- Oh god, are you alright?
- It's ok, it's fine.

487
00:28:05,848 --> 00:28:09,251
So, so, so sorry.

488
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:13,252
Don't worry, it happens
to a lot of guys.

489
00:28:15,907 --> 00:28:19,907
Why did I say that?

490
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,865
If you can't make your mind up,

491
00:28:23,866 --> 00:28:26,055
we'll never

492
00:28:26,056 --> 00:28:29,468
get started.

493
00:28:29,469 --> 00:28:32,772
And I don't want to wind up

494
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:34,953
being parted,

495
00:28:34,954 --> 00:28:38,604
broken hearted.

496
00:28:38,605 --> 00:28:41,961
So if you really love me,

497
00:28:41,962 --> 00:28:43,783
say "Yes",

498
00:28:43,784 --> 00:28:46,389
and please don't tell me,

499
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,390
"Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps".
