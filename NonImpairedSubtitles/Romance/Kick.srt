It's a very easy language

22
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
When dad told me about you
No, it's not your fault

23
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The flight was early

24
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Everything has change

25
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The last time i seen you
You look very good

26
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500

30
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Came here for some job
Dad want's me to marry

31
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The train is perfect
If we were at home..should be a problem

32
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
They would have fuss untill
we both don't agree to marry

33
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Our situation is the same

34
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
We don't want to marry
And our people won't spare us alone

35
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Who is the guy?

36
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Who?

37
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Whom you are lost with

38
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
A policemen don't be wrong

39
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I get the truth easyily

40
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
A very strict officer

41
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The first time i met him

Worst day of my life!

He had every solution
to every problem

46
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500

Tie it on my neck

85
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Wedding is complte

86
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You gave me information about this marriage

87
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
And you conduct this marriage

88
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Did you tell about this marriage

89
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,730
Why?

90
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,860
For kick!

91
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,630
Do you've to come this far to marry?

92
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,140
Can't we tie the knot before
a God's photo a home?

93
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,970
If anyone asks in future
about your marriage,

94
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,640
Oh no don't ask about it,

95
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,970
it had running, chasing,
jumping, firing,

96
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,740
when you tell it had everything,
it'll be kick to you and the listener.

97
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,990
Don't tell your children stories
about crows and foxes.

98
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,090
Tell them your marriage story,
it'll give them kick.

99
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,490
Hey! Had we been caught
we would've lost lives.

100
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,090
Useless life! What if it's lost!

101
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,160
Can we get kick if we fear for that?

102
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,770
I can't take it anymore.

103
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:56,100
Brother, it's not important
why you did all this,

104
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,610
I was sad for eloping to marry
without my mother,

105
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,510
but now with your grace,
I don't have that worry too.

106
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,770
It's giving me terrible kick!

107
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,850
May God bless you with life long kick!

108
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:18,120
Even rogue elephant will
calm down on seeing me.

109
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:23,030
You made me run on streets
like a dog.

110
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,700
I'll not spare you,
I'll make you fall at my feet.

111
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,370
Don't taunt and make
a saint into roaring lion,

112
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,140
don't make me show my other face,

113
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,770
even if you think, it can't happen,

114
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,890
because I've only one face!

115
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,710
Did you expect punch dialogue, sister?
That's not my character. Bye sister.

116
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,220
Who is he?

117
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,930
Will he play with other's lives
for his kick?

118
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,230
Is he human?

119
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,900
You got this doubt if he's human now,

120
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
No, one new it's his first kick

121
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,900
This is his thrill

122
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
It was in his mother's stomache

123
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,900
It was a normal delivery
at the hospital

124
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
He was not normal
but born up side down

125
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,900
He was making the doctor smile

126
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
When kid's had bottle in there mouth
he was

127
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,900
He use to dive from the top into
his swimming pool

128
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
He use to do thing's upside down

129
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
He use to use both his hand
to play

130
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
He defeated everyone

131
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,900
He use to use laptop
and type upside down

132
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
He will do anything for kick?

133
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,900
Strange
What a character

134
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,400
No, total torture

135
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,900
Look at him with the bike and scooter

136
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Next meeting
How did you meet

137
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,900

00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Jhumki

142
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Pick up the phone

143
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
Every love story is a dream

144
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Love and with you

145
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
When it will happen you
will not see anything

146
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Think only of me

147
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
This is my love hangover

148
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Nothing like that to happen

149
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Ok i'll get my kick inside

They are misbehaving with the girl's
and you people just looking

151
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
Go to the gym and work out

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000

153

Do you no who i am?

154
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
You a bastard

155
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
Were you scared of him

156
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
They will come hit me from behind

157
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
Boss will come alone

158

In this group there is and innocent
man standing in the crowd

161
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
He is watching all the fun

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
To beat him is nessesarary

Don't fear son
Mother will take care for us

243
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,960
Is everyone in the famiIy a drunkard?

244
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,470
Very naughty.

245
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,650
My husband is getting
ruined because of him.

246
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,980
He not an idiot either.

247
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:43,660
He stood first in schooI,
Inter, Engineering coIIege.

248
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:47,390
First in everything.
He is not Iazy too.

249
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:51,160
One day, he came to me saying he
got a job with Rs.50000 saIary.

The next day he came and
said he Ieft the job.

252
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,840
I asked him why.

He said that he has
Iost kick in thatjob.

254
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,670
He keeps taking up jobs
and resigning next day.

255
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,280
Neither I understand him
nor his kick.

256
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,350
I thought he wiII change
if he marries.

257
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,180
PeopIe who know this idiot wiII
not give their daughter to him.

258
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,010
Even our reIatives have
stopped visiting us,

259
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,850
fearing that we might
seek an aIIiance.

His heart is very good

276
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,020
What is this kick?

277
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,520
Hope he don't kick me

278

After marriage you are going
to come and stay with us

287
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,520

Please don't show me your attitude

01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
The entire police force in search

337

It's difficult to run my home

338
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Stop talking rubbish
Go away

339
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,500
Do you see my condition
to have that kind of money

01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000

01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,500

Officer mind your langauge

353
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Why the anger on your face

354
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,500
I was thinking why you did not call

355
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Thank you for helping me?

356
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:25,380
Partner? Who is your partner?

357
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:27,050
You heIped me in robbing, right?

358
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:30,050
ActuaIIy I knew that Minister's
money is with the peon.

359
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:33,060
After I made you my partner in
the pIan and you caught him,

360
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:34,730
I came to know
where's the money,

361
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:37,530
it means I made you aIso
my partner in the crime, right?

362
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:40,030
Want me to send your share
of the booty, partner?

363
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:41,640
I Iike you...

364
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:46,070
You're making a grave mistake
by making me your partner.

365
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,370
You became my partner the day
you shot a buIIet into me.

366
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:54,610
If I had been your partner I wouId've
shot the buIIet into your heart.

367
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:06,110
You should be at the olympic's

368
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:08,610
Lottery

369
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:10,330
You Iike chaIIenges.

370
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,800
You can guess it from my
modus operandi, say something new.

371
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,900
Your body can bear anything.

372
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:18,770
You can say it Iooking at my body,
say something new.

373
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:21,340
You trust your sense of timing,

374
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,210
you're cocksure nobody
can catch you,

375
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:26,710
above aII you're good in
making caustic remarks.

376
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:32,320
You can judge it from my words,
say something new, partner.

377
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:37,390
If my guess is right, you're near by,
Iooking at me whiIe speaking to me.

378
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:44,490
Your guess is perfectIy right.

379
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:47,100
One more thing,
you're the best one to catch me,

380
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:52,080
but do remember one thing,
I'm aIways top and you're aIways down.

381
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:56,410
You can never catch me.

382
01:10:56,620 --> 01:11:01,450
You've hurt my ego unnecessariIy,
and chaIIenged me,

383
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:05,920
wherever you may hide,
I'II hunt you down.

384
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:09,420
How can you catch me, partner?
Do you know how do I Iook Iike?

385
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:10,590
You don't know.

386
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:13,330
Do you know where wouId I be?
You don't know.

387
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:16,230
Do you know who's next victim?
You don't know.

388
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,200
Do you know where
wouId I be tomorrow?

389
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:42,660
You don't want to meet the
character in your story,

390
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:46,220
but I want to meet the
character in my story,

391
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,720
He is nearby

392
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:55,220
This time he can't escape

393
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,720
I will get him

394
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:20,220

Devi

399
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,720
He ignored me

400
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:23,220
What is he doing here!

401
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,720
He came for a treatment

402
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:36,220
What problem he has

403
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,720
He can be better

404
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:03,220
Can i take him home

405
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,720

Someone no's me

412
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:47,220

413

414

Are you a patient

418
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,500

His the same kick guy

420

His memory is lost

421
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Why did you bring the memory card home

422
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,500
To gain his memory back

423
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000

Let's see who is the devil

441

India's health care is

01:43:22,670 --> 01:43:24,160
I've killed thousands..

461
01:43:26,030 --> 01:43:28,260
Because I don't have enough
medicines in my possession..

462
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:33,150
neither the latest technology..

463
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:35,160
Absolutely true..

01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:39,470
Who are you looking for?

473
01:44:39,470 --> 01:44:40,470
Nobody..

474
01:45:13,890 --> 01:45:17,920
Why did the world health standard
reject your medicines and machines?

475
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:21,090
We are here..
We will sort everything..

480

Shaina gave Devil the bracelet
as a gift..

481
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:02,430
What is the connection between
Shaina and Devil?

482
01:46:10,330 --> 01:46:12,360
My lifes biggest tragedy..

To protect her ex - boyfriend..

486
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:43,490
I don't know about Devil..
but Devi won't shoot Shaina..

487
01:47:43,490 --> 01:47:51,050
If you don't know, then look into
my eyes and tell me who is inside..

488
01:47:51,050 --> 01:47:56,040
Devi or Devil..

489
01:53:57,830 --> 01:53:59,210
I've had enough..

490
01:54:32,010 --> 01:54:35,070
I know that my son is the Devil..

491
01:55:04,810 --> 01:55:08,330
My name is Anil Singh..
and this is my wife Nandini..

494
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:19,890
Our little family
and our little dreams..

495
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:26,520
Everything was perfect..

496
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:32,430
One day Jhumki fell unconscious..
We rushed her to hospital..

497
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:36,040
The doctor said that
Jhumki had a tumor..

498
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:40,280
She didn't have much time and we needed
to get money urgent for the treatment..

499
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:44,340
We sold Nandini's jewelry
to get the money..

500
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:54,140
Jhumki was our life..

501
01:55:54,140 --> 01:55:58,070
and if we lost our life,
how were we to live?

502
01:55:59,910 --> 01:56:01,710
our strength was finished..

503
01:56:01,710 --> 01:56:04,870
Maybe in our death,
we would find new a life..

504
01:56:04,870 --> 01:56:09,540
She is in St Marys Home..
Please save her..

505
01:57:03,230 --> 01:57:07,440
Father, how much money
do we have in the bank?

506
01:57:30,790 --> 01:57:33,480
What if Jhumki dies?

507
01:57:33,490 --> 01:57:35,940
There is one thing
we can do..

508
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:40,770
We have a trust..
Angel health care..

509
01:57:47,470 --> 01:57:49,090
Hey make it fast..

510
01:57:49,090 --> 01:57:51,600
Yes Sir..
-Humans are not mannequins..

511
01:57:53,210 --> 01:57:55,220
How long must I hold
this titanic pose.. Quickly..

512
01:57:56,550 --> 01:57:58,230
Sir, I studied one case..

513
01:58:09,050 --> 01:58:10,080
Who's child is it?

514
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:13,350
Your relative..
-No sir, not my relative..

515
01:58:16,540 --> 01:58:18,290
Sir you have many charitable trusts..

516
01:59:32,620 --> 01:59:35,110
10 thousand.. Are you mad?

517
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:47,940
Remember I told you that you
would come begging at my feet one day..

518
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:12,900
Today who won?
Me or him..

519
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:46,870
At least give a smile..

520
02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:42,080
Look how happy they are..

521
02:02:52,490 --> 02:02:58,170
But think about it.. the whole city..
the whole state.. the whole country

522
02:02:58,170 --> 02:03:01,240
How  many kids suffer ?

523
02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:06,060
I will get all the childrens lists

524
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:24,820
Everywhere I'm asked..
What gives me this kick?

525
02:03:25,740 --> 02:03:28,680
Think, From where did I get that kick?

526
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:31,750
from a small childs smile..

527
02:03:33,220 --> 02:03:36,230
If 1 smile gives me such a kick..

528
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:42,360
How many kicks would I get
from a thousand smiles?

529
02:03:47,950 --> 02:03:50,420
Where are we going to get so much money?

530
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,030
from the same place this came..

531
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:13,750
But he was going to shoot me..
-No my child...

532
02:04:18,310 --> 02:04:21,040
He will never do that..

533
02:06:46,510 --> 02:06:53,140
I get my kicks from victory..
but losing kicks are not that bad..

534
02:07:58,530 --> 02:08:01,520
Don't be afraid..
they don't know who you are..

535
02:08:36,850 --> 02:08:38,790
its the answer to my childrens future..

536
02:08:42,500 --> 02:08:43,370
You will die..

537
02:08:43,370 --> 02:08:45,330
Then on the 14 November
I will die..

538
02:08:45,330 --> 02:08:49,570
but on the 15 of November,
I'll join you..

539
02:08:49,570 --> 02:08:52,020
and you won't be able
to do a thing about it.

540
02:08:54,440 --> 02:08:57,010
14 November

541
02:09:03,430 --> 02:09:06,680
Come on .. make it fast
quickly quickly..

542
02:09:13,370 --> 02:09:14,810
Are you mad?
can't you see?

543
02:09:25,070 --> 02:09:26,920
Don't fool around..
not today..

544
02:09:30,210 --> 02:09:32,580
I know..
He will come..

545
02:09:32,580 --> 02:09:33,580
He will definitely come..

546
02:10:15,250 --> 02:10:16,130
now watch the fun..

547
02:14:16,380 --> 02:14:17,960
I always win..

548
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:48,790
Who are you?

549
02:15:43,380 --> 02:15:44,890
hey kill him..

550
02:16:24,180 --> 02:16:25,600
As you sow..
so shall you reap..

551
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:28,820
All the treatments will be free..
absolutely free..

552
02:16:31,480 --> 02:16:35,390
All the money that comes..
will be spent on the children only..

553
02:17:21,310 --> 02:17:23,750
My king..
-Speak my king..

554
02:17:23,750 --> 02:17:31,690
You take the van and go..
while I take the police on a joyride..

555
02:19:00,270 --> 02:19:01,010
Whats happening here?

556
02:19:01,020 --> 02:19:03,330
Today is 14 November
Childrens day..

557
02:19:48,190 --> 02:19:56,770
Everything is over..
you used force.. you travelled abroad.. but

558
02:20:59,940 --> 02:21:01,120
He is going to handle the Devil case..

559
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:03,740
I know him..
-Hmm

560
02:21:05,180 --> 02:21:08,010
I'm sure I know you..
-I doubt it partner

561
02:21:08,010 --> 02:21:13,020
Because I don't forget
a case or a face..

562
02:21:14,920 --> 02:21:16,040
What is this new drama?

563
02:21:16,040 --> 02:21:18,460
Its not a drama..
Its a kick..

564
02:21:18,460 --> 02:21:20,000
Didn't I tell you..

565
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,160
14 November you will kill me..

566
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:26,870
on the 15th I'll join you,
and you won't be able to do a thing about it.

567
02:21:28,270 --> 02:21:29,140
What are your'll going on about?

568
02:21:33,330 --> 02:21:35,700
Devi has come..
I'm sure Devil won't be far behind..

569
02:21:42,740 --> 02:21:47,620
Partner, I was never against you..

570
02:21:49,190 --> 02:21:50,950
It was all about the children..

571
02:21:50,950 --> 02:21:53,980
Women and work..
You took both away..

572
02:21:53,980 --> 02:21:55,570
and you telling me
you not against me..

573
02:21:55,570 --> 02:21:56,570
Its not the first time..

574
02:21:59,850 --> 02:22:01,710
You will never understand
