1
00:02:14,512 --> 00:02:17,389
(man) Watch yourselves. Watch out there!

2
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:28,067
Hello, hello.
Either hurry up or let a man pass.

3
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,028
Partner, these people
have come a long way too,

4
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:34,281
so l know you won't mind
them going ahead. Ma'am.

5
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:41,455
Watch your step, ma'am. Excuse me.

6
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:43,499
l'm next.

7
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:52,132
Old people should go last
or get the hell out of the way.

8
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:56,345
l'm so sorry, Mr Quigley.
We seem to be holding that man up.

9
00:02:56,428 --> 00:03:00,933
No, ma'am. l just spoke to him
and he ain't in that big a hurry after all.

10
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:24,874
- Where are you from, mate?
- Wyoming.

11
00:03:24,957 --> 00:03:28,252
- That near Sydney?
- Bit further north.

12
00:03:29,253 --> 00:03:32,548
Hey. l can tell you're a bloke
who's looking for somebody.

13
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:35,301
- No? Something?
- l could use a good horse.

14
00:03:35,384 --> 00:03:39,471
lt's a gentleman from the land of the free
and the home of the brave. A drink?

15
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:42,474
A place to rest your bones?
A woman, perhaps?

16
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:44,560
(screams)

17
00:04:09,043 --> 00:04:12,922
l don't reckon the lady's
all that anxious to get in your wagon.

18
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:16,300
Roy? Oh, Roy, it's you!

19
00:04:16,383 --> 00:04:20,095
- l'm not Roy, lady.
- Every time there's a ship from America

20
00:04:20,179 --> 00:04:23,682
l come down here looking for you.
Thank God you've come for me!

21
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:26,977
l'm sorry, Roy. l'm sorry.
l'm sorry for everything.

22
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,397
Does Crazy Cora belong to you?

23
00:04:30,481 --> 00:04:34,485
Didn't say that. l said
she don't wanna get in your wagon.

24
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:40,991
The boss says we can take some white
tarts back, cos we're sick of black ladies.

25
00:04:41,075 --> 00:04:44,995
So tell Cora to come quiet,
and we'll feed her regular and everything.

26
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,540
Please take me home, Roy.

27
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:55,965
Bugger off, mate.

28
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,553
Excuse me.

29
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:10,437
l'm new here, so l ain't rightly certain.

30
00:05:12,022 --> 00:05:15,568
ls everybody in this country
as butt ugly as you three?

31
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,966
(Cora) Look out, Roy.

32
00:05:39,884 --> 00:05:41,302
Sorry, Roy!

33
00:06:05,534 --> 00:06:07,786
You stay out of this!

34
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:12,333
- Sorry, Roy.
- My name ain't Roy. lt's Matthew Quigley.

35
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,793
You?

36
00:06:15,336 --> 00:06:18,130
You're the fella Marston
sent us to bring back.

37
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:20,925
(Cora) We sure showed 'em.
Didn't we, Roy?

38
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:36,482
(Quigley) Got somethin' against
ridin' horses?

39
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:40,361
(man) We ride 'em when it suits us.
Bullocks eat and drink rougher.

40
00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:43,447
You can put your saddle
on one of them, if you like.

41
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:45,533
(laughter)

42
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:50,996
Riding in the back with the women.
Should have brought my own horse.

43
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,665
(giggles)

44
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:55,668
- l wasn't talking to you.
- Don't worry, Roy.

45
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:58,754
Everything's gonna turn out just fine.

46
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,338
- What you doing?
- l'm gonna bandage your head.

47
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:44,175
lt must hurt real bad.
l wanna help it get better.

48
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:45,926
Quit!

49
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:49,430
You've helped me enough already.

50
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,559
l'm much obliged.

51
00:07:59,523 --> 00:08:03,736
l don't know why you're being such
a big baby about this, Roy. Hold still.

52
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:06,488
Quit! Who the hell is this Roy, anyway?

53
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:09,241
Hey! Do you need a hand
with Crazy Cora?

54
00:08:09,325 --> 00:08:11,619
(laughter)

55
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:23,130
Here.

56
00:08:24,048 --> 00:08:26,050
Thank you.

57
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:33,224
Look, lady. l don't know no Roy,
so you just leave me alone.

58
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:45,194
Go on.

59
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,544
(Cora) Yoo-hoo.

60
00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:06,090
Good night, Roy.

61
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:11,011
Good night, lady.

62
00:09:58,142 --> 00:10:00,769
Way-hup. Way.

63
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:09,528
- What the bloody hell is it?
- Redcoats.

64
00:10:10,112 --> 00:10:12,698
Mr Ashley-Bloody-Pitt and his heroes.

65
00:10:16,452 --> 00:10:19,246
- Friends of yours?
- They're British.

66
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,651
- (driver) Get that away from my team!
- Why are you taking the body back?

67
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:52,363
We've got orders to bring in
all suspected cattle thieves.

68
00:10:52,446 --> 00:10:56,784
- Bugger's dead.
- The trial will not be lengthy.

69
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:59,995
- Carry on, Sergeant.
- We're looking for two deserters.

70
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,207
- (man) Can't say l blame 'em.
- Have you seen 'em?

71
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,460
No.

72
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:10,506
New distractions, eh?
Who's this chap on the back here?

73
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:14,677
- (man) The Yank Marston's brought out.
- Yank, eh?

74
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,640
Come to do for Marston what
these bog-lrish convicts obviously can't.

75
00:11:19,723 --> 00:11:23,018
You just do your job
and stay out of trouble.

76
00:11:23,102 --> 00:11:27,064
ln our experience,
Americans are uncouth misfits

77
00:11:27,147 --> 00:11:31,402
who have been run out
of their own barbaric country.

78
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:34,196
- Well, Lieutenant...
- Major!

79
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:40,119
Major, we already run
the misfits out of our country.

80
00:11:42,663 --> 00:11:45,249
We sent 'em back to England.

81
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:46,834
(sniggering)

82
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:19,783
(Cora) What are they, koala bears?

83
00:12:20,701 --> 00:12:22,661
Kangaroos, l reckon.

84
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,334
Whatever they are, Roy,
nature sure played an awful trick on 'em.

85
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:32,421
l am fed up with you.
And l am fed up with Roy, whoever he is.

86
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:34,798
My name is Matthew.

87
00:12:34,882 --> 00:12:39,887
Well, pardon the hell outta me. l can't
believe you'd talk to me like that, Roy.

88
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,348
l oughta wash your mouth out with soap.

89
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:46,477
You are half a bubble off the plumb,
and that's for sure and for certain.

90
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,565
Just because the road is rocky doesn't
mean your spirits should get rocky too.

91
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:56,362
When do we get to Marston's ranch?

92
00:12:56,445 --> 00:12:59,448
Been on his bloody land
for the last two days.

93
00:13:01,242 --> 00:13:02,660
Hey!

94
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:27,518
(bird call)

95
00:13:33,148 --> 00:13:35,860
Things seem different here.

96
00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:39,655
They say God made Australia last,
don't you know?

97
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:43,826
After he got tired of making
everything else the same.

98
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:47,413
l've seen some pretty country,
that's for certain.

99
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,669
What are you doing so far from home?

100
00:13:58,716 --> 00:14:02,553
There hasn't been anyone else but you.

101
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:04,847
You know that, don't you?

102
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:10,311
You can take me if you want to, Roy.

103
00:14:10,394 --> 00:14:13,397
God Almighty, lady. Go to sleep.

104
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:57,650
Whoo-hoo!

105
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:06,635
Wait till you see what we've got for you.

106
00:16:07,428 --> 00:16:09,430
Matthew Quigley.

107
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:13,058
Elliott Marston. Welcome to Australia.

108
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:15,978
Well, sir, your men already welcomed me.

109
00:16:18,063 --> 00:16:22,026
Coogan, Mr Quigley's luggage.
Take it to the lodge.

110
00:16:27,364 --> 00:16:31,202
Mr Marston, you said you'd pay me
$50 in gold coin just for showing up.

111
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:34,997
- You don't waste time.
- l spent three months just gettin' here.

112
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:40,127
You intrigued me, Mr Quigley.

113
00:16:41,337 --> 00:16:45,090
21 men answered my advertisement,
from all over the world.

114
00:16:45,174 --> 00:16:47,218
Canada, lndia, England.

115
00:16:48,636 --> 00:16:51,055
They just wrote letters.

116
00:16:51,138 --> 00:16:55,518
But you... had a way with words.

117
00:16:57,144 --> 00:17:02,399
My advertisement stated that l wanted
to hire the finest marksman in the world.

118
00:17:04,443 --> 00:17:06,445
Have l?

119
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,424
The legendary Sharp.

120
00:17:27,508 --> 00:17:31,929
You know your weapons.
lt's a lever-action breach loader.

121
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:36,225
Usual barrel length's 30 inches.
This one has an extra four.

122
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:40,938
lt's converted to use a special
.45-calibre, 1 10-grain metal cartridge

123
00:17:41,021 --> 00:17:43,816
with a 540-grain paper-patched bullet.

124
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:48,153
lt's fitted with double set triggers
and a vernier sight.

125
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:54,160
lt's marked up to 1200 yards.
This one shoots a mite further.

126
00:17:56,662 --> 00:18:01,250
An experimental weapon
with experimental ammunition.

127
00:18:02,126 --> 00:18:04,795
You could call it that.

128
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:06,881
Let's experiment.

129
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,803
Whitey, take that bucket
and ride out until l signal.

130
00:18:22,271 --> 00:18:25,149
Tell me when you want him to stop.

131
00:18:38,954 --> 00:18:42,958
Your man able to hit
something that far away?

132
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:46,045
l don't know him. l never saw him before.

133
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:53,177
He'd have to be a good shot all right.

134
00:18:58,724 --> 00:19:01,101
'Bout there'll do.

135
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:03,187
(gunshot)

136
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:08,651
Bullshit.

137
00:20:12,256 --> 00:20:18,888
Are you quite certain, Mr Quigley, that
you wouldn't like the bucket a bit closer?

138
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:28,105
(man) Yo! Jesus Christ!

139
00:20:29,481 --> 00:20:31,025
Quite certain.

140
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:49,335
Told you. Only my Roy could
hit a coyote from that distance.

141
00:20:59,386 --> 00:21:02,598
Very impressive. You're hired.

142
00:21:10,105 --> 00:21:15,402
Would you excuse me for a minute?
There's some business l have to attend to.

143
00:21:15,486 --> 00:21:17,821
You might find this interesting.

144
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:20,407
(Cora) Nice shootin', Roy.

145
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:23,160
Mr Marston?

146
00:21:24,161 --> 00:21:28,374
l think there's been a mistake.
The one they call Crazy Cora.

147
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:34,922
l'd appreciate it if your men leave her
alone till you and l have a chance to talk.

148
00:21:35,005 --> 00:21:37,007
Whatever you want.

149
00:21:42,346 --> 00:21:45,641
You are deserters from
Her Majesty's armed forces.

150
00:21:45,724 --> 00:21:50,813
The penalty is death. You were on my
land. l could shoot you for trespassing.

151
00:21:50,896 --> 00:21:54,692
Look, you let us stay here, guv'nor,
we'll serve you proper.

152
00:21:55,943 --> 00:21:58,904
Better than this convict scum you've got.

153
00:21:58,946 --> 00:22:04,034
Your commanding officer Major
Ashley-Pitt and l have an understanding,

154
00:22:04,118 --> 00:22:07,496
and so you'll be sent back
to face the firing party.

155
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,625
But l see no reason why you
should be trussed up like animals.

156
00:22:12,793 --> 00:22:14,253
Mr Dobkin.

157
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,595
This is my preferred weapon, Mr Quigley.

158
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:08,682
Do join me for dinner.

159
00:23:18,817 --> 00:23:21,487
The Yank's a damn good shot
with a long rifle.

160
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:26,450
Sure. But you give me a weapon like that
and l could beat him with my eyes shut.

161
00:23:26,534 --> 00:23:29,954
Easy to say, O'Flynn.
You've got a lot to learn.

162
00:23:30,037 --> 00:23:32,873
Look at you, Dobkin.
You've been here 12 years,

163
00:23:32,957 --> 00:23:37,962
and all you've got to show for it is cold
mutton. He's even getting a fancy dinner.

164
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:44,176
You were actually in Dodge City?

165
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:48,055
William Hickok must have been there.

166
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:51,934
Spent a night there once.
l was pretty tired.

167
00:23:52,017 --> 00:23:54,979
Dodge City's a nice place
to get some sleep.

168
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:02,528
Are you familiar with
the army revolver, Mr Quigley?

169
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:08,033
Well, sir, l never had much use for one.

170
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:13,122
lt's a recent invention of
your countryman Colonel Colt.

171
00:24:13,205 --> 00:24:17,751
God created all men. They say
Sam Colt made 'em equal. More or less.

172
00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:20,129
(chuckles)

173
00:24:20,212 --> 00:24:25,467
That's what l like about you Americans.
You're people of action, not words.

174
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:28,804
That mint jelly on your lamb.

175
00:24:29,847 --> 00:24:32,266
lt's my own creation.

176
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:36,854
No, l'm a student of your American West.
l've read a great deal about it.

177
00:24:37,938 --> 00:24:40,316
Tell me about dingoes.

178
00:24:41,942 --> 00:24:46,780
£10 a month for shooting wild dogs
seems like a whole lot for not much.

179
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:50,743
Besides, you got enough men
and guns outside

180
00:24:50,826 --> 00:24:53,913
to kill every dingo within ten miles of here.

181
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,292
Unless you're talking about deserters.

182
00:25:00,461 --> 00:25:06,467
Did you know that your American lndian
is a race that has no word for ''wheel''.

183
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:12,306
No concept of farming.
No understanding of land ownership.

184
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:16,310
- ls that a fact?
- Mm.

185
00:25:17,728 --> 00:25:21,732
From what l hear, you found a solution
to that problem in your country.

186
00:25:22,983 --> 00:25:26,445
l guess that depends on
whether you're an lndian or not.

187
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:34,620
You see, in many ways...
our two nations are quite similar.

188
00:25:36,121 --> 00:25:39,917
We both brought civilisation
to the Stone Age.

189
00:25:43,546 --> 00:25:47,508
Unfortunately, in this country
we have failed in one regard.

190
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:52,054
We have been unable to domesticate
the most backward people in the world -

191
00:25:53,222 --> 00:25:56,016
the Australian Aborigine.

192
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,561
Don't mind him. He's harmless.

193
00:26:05,943 --> 00:26:09,905
My parents were slaughtered
by Aborigines, Mr Quigley.

194
00:26:09,947 --> 00:26:14,451
They attacked so fast my mother
was found dead still holding her sewing.

195
00:26:16,036 --> 00:26:18,455
Nowadays they butcher sheep and cattle.

196
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:23,752
Her Majesty's government allows settlers
to deal with the matter their own way.

197
00:26:24,587 --> 00:26:29,341
lt's official policy.
lt's called ''pacification by force''.

198
00:26:32,303 --> 00:26:37,850
But the real issue...
is that, primitive as they are,

199
00:26:39,226 --> 00:26:42,730
the Aborigines have learned
to keep out of rifle range.

200
00:26:46,108 --> 00:26:50,446
Which brings us to you... Mr Quigley.

201
00:26:54,492 --> 00:26:56,660
What the hell?

202
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:03,834
No! Stay right where you are.

203
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:08,672
No man knocks me out of my own house.

204
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:17,223
(punch)

205
00:27:21,602 --> 00:27:24,605
Don't just stand there. Get him.

206
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:32,238
- Has he got the rifle with him?
- He keeps it right beside him.

207
00:27:32,321 --> 00:27:35,074
l said, get him!

208
00:27:54,301 --> 00:27:57,263
He's just sitting in there with that big gun.

209
00:28:14,363 --> 00:28:16,407
(Coogan) Keep down. Kelly, up there.

210
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,868
Carver, take the side.

211
00:28:21,412 --> 00:28:23,789
(Coogan) Brophy, round the back.

212
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:34,633
Fancy American shooter.

213
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,013
Eating real fancy, eh?

214
00:28:50,274 --> 00:28:54,862
(man) Go on, kick him in the back!
Give it him in the back. That's it.

215
00:28:55,863 --> 00:28:57,656
Leave Roy alone!

216
00:28:59,575 --> 00:29:01,702
Get her off me!

217
00:29:01,785 --> 00:29:03,787
(laughter)

218
00:29:13,964 --> 00:29:18,761
Throw him in the wagon. Haul him
two days from here and dump him.

219
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:21,222
Let Australia kill him.

220
00:29:23,265 --> 00:29:25,643
And that crazy woman, too.

221
00:30:46,056 --> 00:30:48,309
You forgot the gold.

222
00:30:49,643 --> 00:30:51,687
What'd he say?

223
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,856
(Quigley) You forgot the gold.

224
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,691
Marston.

225
00:30:56,775 --> 00:30:59,153
He paid him in gold.

226
00:31:00,738 --> 00:31:02,698
He's right.

227
00:31:21,258 --> 00:31:25,221
Give us some water
and you can have the gold.

228
00:31:26,096 --> 00:31:29,600
- l can have the gold anyway.
- That's what l thought you'd say.

229
00:31:39,652 --> 00:31:40,653
Yaah!

230
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:44,865
Yaah!

231
00:32:17,773 --> 00:32:19,775
Go on! Yaah!

232
00:32:44,884 --> 00:32:46,093
Yaah!

233
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:12,411
(Cora groans)

234
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:20,920
l wish people would quit
hitting me on the head.

235
00:33:21,003 --> 00:33:25,716
Don't worry. On a new job it's quite
common for things not to go well at first.

236
00:33:57,373 --> 00:34:00,209
- (Cora) We should...
- What?

237
00:34:02,294 --> 00:34:06,215
l remember, my granddaddy told me
how when you're lost in the desert

238
00:34:06,298 --> 00:34:09,468
you should sleep during the day
and walk at night.

239
00:34:09,552 --> 00:34:12,096
Your granddaddy tell you that?

240
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:16,267
He also tell you we'll die in the desert
without those horses?

241
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:19,687
What good are horses if we die first?

242
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,567
Once in a while she actually
makes a little sense.

243
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,363
- What did you say, Roy?
- Never mind.

244
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,342
Good morning, Major.

245
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:38,260
Marston.

246
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:43,557
What can l get for you?
Some refreshment?

247
00:37:43,641 --> 00:37:45,643
That's very kind, sir.

248
00:37:45,726 --> 00:37:50,731
l'd be obliged if you would
identify for me two dead bodies.

249
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:58,781
Two men absconded.

250
00:37:58,906 --> 00:38:03,661
But l imagine this is a couple of
newcomers who wandered off recently.

251
00:38:04,703 --> 00:38:07,498
- A man and a woman?
- Nah.

252
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:15,130
Two men. One has been stabbed
and one shot through the head.

253
00:38:15,214 --> 00:38:17,591
(Dobkin) Coogan and Miller.

254
00:38:20,553 --> 00:38:24,723
lt would appear that the man
and the woman are still missing.

255
00:38:27,226 --> 00:38:29,728
Yes, it would, wouldn't it?

256
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:32,690
Don't worry, Major.

257
00:38:33,816 --> 00:38:36,819
l have no doubt l'll find them.

258
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,744
(man speaking Aborigine)

259
00:38:55,129 --> 00:38:57,756
(men chant)

260
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:41,217
(echoing call)

261
00:39:49,225 --> 00:39:51,435
(echoing call)

262
00:39:56,148 --> 00:39:58,901
(echoing call)

263
00:40:02,905 --> 00:40:05,115
(echoing call)

264
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:07,493
( didgeridoo music)

265
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:12,623
(echoing call)

266
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:15,793
(hand clap)

267
00:40:17,127 --> 00:40:19,797
(echoing call)

268
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:28,848
Hey, lady.

269
00:40:30,724 --> 00:40:33,018
Are you OK?

270
00:40:33,143 --> 00:40:35,104
Think so.

271
00:40:41,777 --> 00:40:44,238
What are they gonna do to us?

272
00:40:45,281 --> 00:40:49,201
l reckon they already done it.
They gave us water.

273
00:40:52,496 --> 00:40:54,707
But that don't make sense.

274
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:59,670
They let me keep it when every white man
with a rifle's trying to kill 'em.

275
00:40:59,753 --> 00:41:02,756
- Except for you.
- They don't know that.

276
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,970
Don't they? Something tells me
you and l were on the shady side of dead.

277
00:41:08,053 --> 00:41:11,849
This is a special place.
Bet they used magic on us.

278
00:41:11,932 --> 00:41:16,145
That old man over there,
looks like he's... some kind of chief,

279
00:41:16,228 --> 00:41:18,981
or medicine man, or something.

280
00:41:19,106 --> 00:41:21,400
What's this? There.

281
00:41:25,237 --> 00:41:29,742
Likely something that came out of
the south end of a northbound kangaroo.

282
00:41:29,825 --> 00:41:32,578
You mean kangaroo shit?

283
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:53,933
Very kind.

284
00:41:54,016 --> 00:41:57,436
- Do you think they're safe to eat?
- You got a better idea?

285
00:42:11,492 --> 00:42:13,536
Much obliged.

286
00:42:16,705 --> 00:42:18,707
Go on.

287
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:22,878
l don't eat things that are still moving.

288
00:42:24,922 --> 00:42:27,383
(mumbles) Gonna shoot it first?

289
00:42:38,269 --> 00:42:39,687
Mm-hm.

290
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,523
(giggling)

291
00:42:47,153 --> 00:42:47,820
Hm.

292
00:42:49,155 --> 00:42:51,949
(man speaks in Aborigine)

293
00:42:52,032 --> 00:42:54,660
(Quigley) Yo? Yo?

294
00:42:54,743 --> 00:42:56,704
Yo? Yo!

295
00:42:57,037 --> 00:42:58,831
(men) Yo.

296
00:43:07,464 --> 00:43:11,844
After you cut this strip out
of this big piece of kangaroo...

297
00:43:13,012 --> 00:43:15,389
There we go. Take...

298
00:43:15,472 --> 00:43:18,475
(speaks Aborigine)

299
00:43:23,147 --> 00:43:26,108
(speaks Aborigine)

300
00:43:28,819 --> 00:43:30,613
Here.

301
00:43:42,374 --> 00:43:44,418
Swing your arm. Roll your wrist.

302
00:43:44,502 --> 00:43:48,088
You gotta keep that loop open.
See how that loop stays open?

303
00:43:48,547 --> 00:43:52,551
You look at what you're throwing at.
Swing the rope and throw right at it.

304
00:43:52,635 --> 00:43:54,637
(laughter)

305
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:56,931
Then you just pull 'em in.

306
00:44:06,732 --> 00:44:08,734
(Aborigines singing)

307
00:44:25,251 --> 00:44:27,253
(Cora laughs)

308
00:44:49,525 --> 00:44:52,736
You just wait till you try this.

309
00:44:52,862 --> 00:44:55,656
But you gotta guess what it is.

310
00:44:57,366 --> 00:45:00,661
That little girl is so darling.

311
00:45:03,706 --> 00:45:05,666
(Quigley) She sure is.

312
00:45:07,459 --> 00:45:10,713
Not as darling as Roy Junior.

313
00:45:10,796 --> 00:45:13,799
God Almighty, lady, not another Roy.

314
00:45:17,595 --> 00:45:21,932
l don't know about you, but my stomach
thinks my throat's been cut.

315
00:45:23,976 --> 00:45:27,438
Roy was hunting sage hens
when the Comanches came.

316
00:45:29,273 --> 00:45:34,028
l grabbed the baby and a pistol
and l hid in the root cellar out back.

317
00:45:34,111 --> 00:45:39,074
The lndians tore up our sod house. l was
real quiet but then the baby started crying.

318
00:45:39,158 --> 00:45:43,204
l tried to shush him and suckle him
but he just wouldn't stop.

319
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:47,958
One Comanche, l remember - he acted
real drunk and wore my green apron.

320
00:45:48,042 --> 00:45:52,296
He must have heard something.
He started hollering and coming closer.

321
00:45:52,379 --> 00:45:58,177
So l put my hand over my baby's mouth.
''Don't cry. Daddy'll be home soon.''

322
00:45:59,637 --> 00:46:02,723
The lndians found us
but they just laughed.

323
00:46:02,806 --> 00:46:07,811
They was drunk, didn't wanna
hurt anybody, and rode away.

324
00:46:09,563 --> 00:46:12,316
Sundown, Roy came home.

325
00:46:12,399 --> 00:46:15,319
l was still afraid to come out of the cellar.

326
00:46:15,402 --> 00:46:20,199
l was afraid of what he'd do
when he saw l'd smothered our son.

327
00:46:23,202 --> 00:46:27,665
l ought to find some way
to mend this petticoat. Look at that.

328
00:46:38,008 --> 00:46:39,802
Roy...

329
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:47,309
He just buried the baby,
put me in the wagon,

330
00:46:47,393 --> 00:46:51,397
and we went 70 miles
to Galveston without stopping.

331
00:46:52,731 --> 00:46:55,109
He never said a word.

332
00:46:57,153 --> 00:47:02,158
Put me on the first ship he found.
lt was headed to Australia.

333
00:47:05,536 --> 00:47:07,997
Then he said:

334
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,084
''Don't want no woman that would
kill my son to save herself.''

335
00:47:14,628 --> 00:47:18,424
And he turned and he walked away
and he never looked back.

336
00:47:20,426 --> 00:47:24,054
l know, cos l watched to see if he would.

337
00:47:28,851 --> 00:47:31,687
This thing is just falling apart.

338
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:36,192
lt's just...

339
00:48:00,049 --> 00:48:02,051
l'm tired.

340
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:48,556
Don't exactly talk your ear off
saying goodbye, do they?

341
00:48:50,558 --> 00:48:53,811
Johnsons were always like that.

342
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,897
What?

343
00:48:57,022 --> 00:48:58,816
Remember the church social?

344
00:48:58,899 --> 00:49:02,945
They ate everybody's jams and pies
and left without saying a word.

345
00:49:02,987 --> 00:49:07,283
lt's our own fault for
inviting 'em again this year.

346
00:49:07,366 --> 00:49:09,160
Why would they do that?

347
00:49:11,495 --> 00:49:13,789
(Quigley) That's why.

348
00:49:17,877 --> 00:49:19,503
Oh, no.

349
00:49:19,587 --> 00:49:21,839
No!

350
00:49:21,922 --> 00:49:24,300
No. Stay back!

351
00:49:38,105 --> 00:49:39,899
No!

352
00:49:53,746 --> 00:49:55,748
Over there!

353
00:50:06,175 --> 00:50:08,636
(screams) No!

354
00:50:11,055 --> 00:50:12,097
Shit.

355
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:54,014
Of all the damn fool things l ever did see!

356
00:50:54,098 --> 00:50:57,059
You trying to get your head blown off?

357
00:51:05,651 --> 00:51:09,738
Anyone who believes in magic... is crazy.

358
00:51:17,705 --> 00:51:20,166
Don't be running off like that.

359
00:51:21,876 --> 00:51:25,171
l could have used
some help up there, you know.

360
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:31,760
l got my rig back.

361
00:51:31,844 --> 00:51:36,056
But no saddlebags,
which means l can't make my reload.

362
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:39,685
We got one horse and two canteens.

363
00:51:42,605 --> 00:51:46,734
And a rider got away. Which means
Marston'll know where we are.

364
00:51:46,817 --> 00:51:49,278
Yeah. And we don't.

365
00:52:44,917 --> 00:52:46,961
l'm cold.

366
00:52:47,044 --> 00:52:49,547
You got the blanket.

367
00:52:53,801 --> 00:52:55,845
Maybe we could share it tonight.

368
00:52:56,846 --> 00:53:00,391
There's something
l wanna talk to you about.

369
00:53:00,474 --> 00:53:04,687
lf we do, there'll be something
l wanna talk to you about.

370
00:53:34,425 --> 00:53:40,014
When summer comes, let's drag up
some wood for a real cabin.

371
00:53:40,097 --> 00:53:41,807
Cos, Roy, sod walls...

372
00:53:41,891 --> 00:53:43,684
Matthew.

373
00:53:50,024 --> 00:53:51,984
Matthew Quigley.

374
00:53:52,818 --> 00:53:57,490
l ain't sharing my bed till l'm certain
you know who's in it. Now say it.

375
00:53:59,241 --> 00:54:02,703
lf we had a wood cabin
we could get glass windows.

376
00:54:09,168 --> 00:54:11,170
We'll see.

377
00:54:19,637 --> 00:54:22,515
(Cora) The sea's gotta be west.

378
00:54:22,598 --> 00:54:26,519
That's how we're headed,
but you sure wouldn't know it.

379
00:54:26,811 --> 00:54:28,020
Ow!

380
00:54:28,145 --> 00:54:29,772
Hell!

381
00:54:30,523 --> 00:54:32,274
D'you see that?

382
00:54:32,358 --> 00:54:35,361
Sure did. Biggest ant l ever did see.

383
00:54:40,366 --> 00:54:44,036
- What's my name today?
- Matthew Quigley, same as any other day.

384
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:48,582
How's about you and me taking off
all our clothes and going swimming?

385
00:54:50,584 --> 00:54:53,546
What are you? Crazy?
There ain't no water.

386
00:54:55,589 --> 00:54:58,133
Why, shame on you!

387
00:54:58,217 --> 00:55:00,594
Well, you... What about last night? You...

388
00:55:00,678 --> 00:55:03,055
l what?

389
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,561
Never mind.

390
00:55:17,987 --> 00:55:22,366
- How's that, then, Mr Marston?
- Pretty good, O'Flynn. You've improved.

391
00:55:22,449 --> 00:55:25,369
Wear your holster higher.
Grab your gun on the way up.

392
00:55:25,452 --> 00:55:27,496
- l'm faster, aren't l?
- Yeah.

393
00:55:28,622 --> 00:55:31,792
- Think l'll ever be as fast as you?
- lf you practised a lot?

394
00:55:31,876 --> 00:55:33,544
- Yeah.
- No.

395
00:55:33,586 --> 00:55:36,422
(laughter)

396
00:55:42,553 --> 00:55:44,555
Not again.

397
00:55:46,056 --> 00:55:48,601
Where are the others?

398
00:55:48,684 --> 00:55:51,437
Dead. All dead.

399
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,898
Quigley. He was everywhere.

400
00:55:55,232 --> 00:55:59,612
Four more. l don't believe this.
Did you see him?

401
00:56:01,197 --> 00:56:03,282
- lt was too far away.
- How far?

402
00:56:03,365 --> 00:56:06,785
- Three quarters of a mile maybe.
- That's impossible.

403
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:11,999
How long from the time the bullet struck
until you heard the report of the rifle?

404
00:56:12,082 --> 00:56:14,460
Two, maybe three seconds.

405
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:20,883
Matthew Quigley is really
beginning to annoy me.

406
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:26,222
Dobkin. How many men
can we send out there?

407
00:56:28,015 --> 00:56:31,811
These and two others.
Six men are still on a hunting party.

408
00:56:33,479 --> 00:56:35,314
All right.

409
00:56:35,397 --> 00:56:38,859
There's £50 in gold to the man
who brings Quigley in.

410
00:56:40,444 --> 00:56:42,404
So keep practising.

411
00:56:44,114 --> 00:56:47,326
- (Cora) lf we're lost, you can tell me.
- We're lost.

412
00:56:47,409 --> 00:56:51,539
- l can take bad news. Tell me straight.
- l don't know where the hell we are.

413
00:56:51,622 --> 00:56:56,293
- No sense makin' it sound better than it is.
- l reckon we're going in circles.

414
00:56:56,377 --> 00:57:01,340
Flower things up, l'll see right through it.
So just tell me honestly - are we lost?

415
00:57:03,425 --> 00:57:06,303
No. l know exactly where we are.

416
00:57:06,387 --> 00:57:10,391
That's good. Cos, frankly,
l was getting a little worried.

417
00:57:11,851 --> 00:57:15,855
Don't know where we're going,
but there's no use being late.

418
00:57:21,944 --> 00:57:24,321
(distant gunshots)

419
00:57:25,906 --> 00:57:27,700
Yaah!

420
00:57:38,419 --> 00:57:40,129
(horseman) Come on!

421
00:57:40,212 --> 00:57:42,131
(baby cries)

422
00:57:56,103 --> 00:57:57,563
(screaming)

423
00:58:35,142 --> 00:58:38,979
Get the bloody hell outta here!
Quick! Come on, hurry up!

424
00:59:58,267 --> 01:00:00,269
(man groans)

425
01:00:06,859 --> 01:00:08,819
My back's broke.

426
01:00:09,653 --> 01:00:13,115
Your gut's shot, Hobb.
There ain't nothing l can do for you.

427
01:00:14,158 --> 01:00:16,160
Kill me.

428
01:00:17,453 --> 01:00:20,456
Where's Marston's station from here?

429
01:00:21,248 --> 01:00:23,459
How far's the nearest town?

430
01:00:23,542 --> 01:00:25,753
Why should l tell you?

431
01:00:25,836 --> 01:00:28,589
Cos if you don't, l'll let you live.

432
01:00:37,765 --> 01:00:40,935
You know, l'm new here,
so l'm kinda curious.

433
01:00:42,061 --> 01:00:45,523
Do you think the dingoes
will get you first? Or the ants?

434
01:00:45,606 --> 01:00:47,608
(Hobb gasps)

435
01:00:49,026 --> 01:00:51,862
Quigley, don't leave me like this!

436
01:00:54,031 --> 01:00:57,952
Quigley! Marston's station's
two days' ride southwest.

437
01:00:59,161 --> 01:01:01,622
Meekathanga's 20 miles
past the billabong.

438
01:01:01,705 --> 01:01:05,626
Talk straight, goddamnit!
Or l'll get the ants myself.

439
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:10,548
lt's a town, a day's ride
past the dry riverbed.

440
01:01:12,591 --> 01:01:14,593
That way.

441
01:01:25,521 --> 01:01:27,523
Now finish me.

442
01:01:40,286 --> 01:01:43,289
You got one shot left in that shooter.

443
01:01:44,582 --> 01:01:46,709
Make the most of it.

444
01:01:58,387 --> 01:02:00,222
(gunshot)

445
01:02:09,899 --> 01:02:12,193
(baby whimpers)

446
01:02:12,276 --> 01:02:14,361
(baby cries)

447
01:02:29,752 --> 01:02:33,756
All right. All right. Sweet thing.

448
01:03:01,867 --> 01:03:04,829
l reckon we should keep moving
till we find some help.

449
01:03:04,912 --> 01:03:09,458
We should stop for the night. The baby's
hurt and weak. He needs shelter.

450
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:12,545
The kid's probably tougher than we are.

451
01:03:27,893 --> 01:03:33,149
That little fella ate like his bellybutton had
been rubbing a blister on his backbone.

452
01:03:33,232 --> 01:03:37,611
Yeah, he was eating,
but he needs some milk.

453
01:03:37,695 --> 01:03:42,158
l don't recall seeing a whole
lot of milking cows around here.

454
01:03:46,871 --> 01:03:49,874
Should be a town to the southwest.

455
01:03:53,544 --> 01:03:56,672
l reckon we could make it
in a hard day's ride.

456
01:03:56,755 --> 01:04:01,760
We can't make it. He should stay here
with me. You can ride faster without us.

457
01:04:10,978 --> 01:04:13,606
Just leave me the extra rifle and pistol.

458
01:04:13,689 --> 01:04:16,442
You know how to use a shooter?

459
01:04:16,525 --> 01:04:18,652
l am a native-born Texican.

460
01:04:21,906 --> 01:04:26,911
There's enough water for two days,
if l ain't here drinking it.

461
01:04:30,372 --> 01:04:32,500
What do you think?

462
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:34,543
(chuckles)

463
01:04:34,627 --> 01:04:37,546
What? What's the matter?

464
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,842
You.

465
01:04:41,926 --> 01:04:46,931
You're the only man on this continent
that would ask me what l think.

466
01:04:49,809 --> 01:04:52,812
- That ought to do you.
- Thanks for the lizards.

467
01:04:52,895 --> 01:04:57,733
You've checked the guns three times.
There's food and water. We're fine.

468
01:04:57,817 --> 01:05:00,027
- Get going.
- (baby gurgles)

469
01:05:10,329 --> 01:05:14,792
lf you run into any of his own people,
you'll give 'em Little Bit, won't you?

470
01:05:18,212 --> 01:05:20,422
You gotta promise me.

471
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,177
Sure could use something else to wear.

472
01:05:27,137 --> 01:05:29,682
He'd be better off with them.
You know that.

473
01:05:29,765 --> 01:05:34,812
lf you see any dresses that aren't costly,
red's my favourite colour. Red or pink.

474
01:05:34,895 --> 01:05:37,439
But red's my favourite.

475
01:05:42,778 --> 01:05:46,031
Should be back in two days.
lf l ain't back in three...

476
01:05:46,115 --> 01:05:47,783
You'll be back.

477
01:05:47,867 --> 01:05:49,952
You bet.

478
01:07:30,219 --> 01:07:33,180
Highly unusual calibration, Mr Quigley.

479
01:07:34,765 --> 01:07:37,059
This will take some time to duplicate.

480
01:07:37,143 --> 01:07:40,896
lt won't. You can substitute a 450,
number two British musket lead.

481
01:07:41,021 --> 01:07:42,982
Marston ain't gonna wait.

482
01:07:43,107 --> 01:07:45,609
Marston? He's a murderer.

483
01:07:45,693 --> 01:07:49,530
He mixes flour with poison
to kill the Aborigines.

484
01:07:49,613 --> 01:07:53,617
- Yes, this is a cruel, uncivilised...
- Sh, Papa. Let the man eat.

485
01:07:53,701 --> 01:07:56,412
He's got a long ride ahead of him tonight.

486
01:07:56,495 --> 01:08:01,959
l found some condensed milk for the baby
and tins of beef for you and your woman.

487
01:08:02,042 --> 01:08:06,714
- Ma'am, she ain't exactly my woman.
- Klaus, come over here.

488
01:08:06,797 --> 01:08:10,009
Mr Quigley,
l would like you to meet my son.

489
01:08:10,092 --> 01:08:11,844
Pleased to meet you.

490
01:08:11,927 --> 01:08:14,597
l know who you are. You're the American.

491
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,933
The one who's been
helping the Aborigines.

492
01:08:18,017 --> 01:08:21,395
ls that the rifle l've been hearing about?

493
01:08:22,771 --> 01:08:25,774
You can take a look at it, if you like, son.

494
01:08:30,488 --> 01:08:32,781
- lt's so heavy.
- You get used to it.

495
01:08:32,907 --> 01:08:37,244
Son, hid my horse in the gully out back.
l'd be much obliged if you'd bring it up.

496
01:08:37,328 --> 01:08:39,538
Yes, sir.

497
01:08:39,622 --> 01:08:44,376
Klaus, after you get Mr Quigley's horse,
saddle up ours as well.

498
01:08:44,502 --> 01:08:46,545
Yes, Papa.

499
01:08:48,172 --> 01:08:52,843
- He didn't get that from ''wanted'' posters.
- Everyone knows about you.

500
01:08:52,927 --> 01:08:58,557
The Aborigines who come to town to trade
with us talk about the ''spirit warrior''.

501
01:09:01,101 --> 01:09:05,064
l've been called a lot of things,
ma'am, but never that.

502
01:09:15,574 --> 01:09:17,368
(belches)

503
01:09:27,878 --> 01:09:29,588
Get the others.

504
01:09:29,672 --> 01:09:32,842
Young fella, where'd you get this saddle?

505
01:09:50,067 --> 01:09:51,986
(baby cries)

506
01:09:52,069 --> 01:09:55,072
Shh. Don't cry.

507
01:09:55,906 --> 01:09:58,325
Daddy'll be home soon.

508
01:10:00,828 --> 01:10:02,830
(cries)

509
01:10:09,587 --> 01:10:11,881
(dingoes growl)

510
01:10:13,048 --> 01:10:15,176
(baby cries)

511
01:10:27,188 --> 01:10:28,898
(cries loudly)

512
01:10:28,981 --> 01:10:30,691
Shh! Shh!

513
01:10:30,774 --> 01:10:34,069
Don't cry. Hush, baby.
Hush, baby. Hush, baby.

514
01:10:34,153 --> 01:10:37,198
Shh, shh, shh.

515
01:10:37,281 --> 01:10:40,284
Shh. Daddy'll be home soon. Shh.

516
01:10:42,161 --> 01:10:44,288
(dingoes growl)

517
01:10:44,371 --> 01:10:47,625
Daddy'll be home soon.
Daddy'll be home soon.

518
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:51,587
Shh, shh. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry.

519
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:54,215
Daddy'll be home soon.
Daddy'll be home...

520
01:10:54,298 --> 01:10:56,675
(cries loudly)

521
01:11:02,807 --> 01:11:05,893
You cry. You wanna cry?
You cry if you want to.

522
01:11:05,976 --> 01:11:08,437
Go on, darling, cry!

523
01:11:08,521 --> 01:11:12,733
Hell, let's both make some noise!

524
01:11:12,817 --> 01:11:16,570
Yes, we will gather at the river

525
01:11:16,654 --> 01:11:20,658
The beautiful, beautiful river

526
01:11:23,327 --> 01:11:26,789
Yes, we will gather at the river

527
01:11:36,131 --> 01:11:37,466
Git!

528
01:11:40,386 --> 01:11:44,557
Did you see that? l got the one
wearing my green apron!

529
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,769
Run, you damn cowards.
Get your yellow butts outta here!

530
01:11:52,064 --> 01:11:55,067
(dingoes snarl)

531
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:03,576
You'll be hot after this.

532
01:12:07,413 --> 01:12:08,747
(growls)

533
01:12:09,623 --> 01:12:15,087
When you return with the woman and
the baby, l will have your cartridges ready.

534
01:12:16,338 --> 01:12:18,299
Until then.

535
01:12:19,925 --> 01:12:23,387
Much obliged, but...
never had much use for one.

536
01:12:25,681 --> 01:12:28,851
l know l can't repay you
for what you've done, but...

537
01:12:28,934 --> 01:12:31,312
- No, please.
- No, you take it.

538
01:12:32,313 --> 01:12:35,232
- lt's Marston's.
- ln that case...

539
01:12:35,316 --> 01:12:38,402
Are you certain you won't stay the night?

540
01:12:38,486 --> 01:12:39,487
No.

541
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:42,573
Klaus should be here
with the horses by now.

542
01:12:43,657 --> 01:12:46,035
l'd best be getting back.

543
01:12:54,084 --> 01:12:55,628
- Get back inside.
- What?

544
01:12:55,711 --> 01:12:57,463
Now!

545
01:12:57,963 --> 01:13:00,257
(Mrs Grimmelman screams)

546
01:13:00,382 --> 01:13:01,926
- Get here!
- No!

547
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:06,972
Around the front. Oliver, with me.

548
01:13:19,026 --> 01:13:21,028
Check the lane.

549
01:13:29,537 --> 01:13:32,289
- What the hell's going on?
- He's out the front.

550
01:13:32,373 --> 01:13:34,291
Get out!

551
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,354
We got him. Watch the windows.

552
01:13:57,439 --> 01:13:59,024
Upstairs.

553
01:13:59,525 --> 01:14:01,735
Get round the back.

554
01:14:10,494 --> 01:14:12,288
(gunshots)

555
01:15:24,068 --> 01:15:25,903
Hm.

556
01:15:33,285 --> 01:15:35,496
Aw, shit!

557
01:15:54,265 --> 01:15:57,726
He's done for.
The bloody place is falling apart.

558
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:10,156
Quigley! Hey, get round here!

559
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:34,054
Nobody could live through that.

560
01:16:57,369 --> 01:17:00,581
- Did you see where he went?
- lt's pitch black there.

561
01:17:01,373 --> 01:17:04,376
- He couldn't have made it.
- Why not?

562
01:17:05,753 --> 01:17:10,132
- Go down and have a look.
- No, no. You go. l'll stay here.

563
01:17:10,716 --> 01:17:12,384
Excuse me.

564
01:17:19,099 --> 01:17:21,227
l give up! Quigley!

565
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:23,270
Hey, don't shoot.

566
01:17:24,438 --> 01:17:27,942
There. See? Look. Nothing.

567
01:17:28,067 --> 01:17:32,530
You might wanna try your luck with
that belly gun. Then again, you might not.

568
01:17:35,282 --> 01:17:37,660
That's what l figured.

569
01:17:47,336 --> 01:17:49,213
(Klaus) Mama.

570
01:17:49,296 --> 01:17:51,257
Mama.

571
01:17:51,382 --> 01:17:53,175
Mama!

572
01:17:54,385 --> 01:17:56,762
Klaus, my...

573
01:18:00,516 --> 01:18:02,518
(Klaus weeps)

574
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:10,568
Why?

575
01:18:16,991 --> 01:18:18,993
(sobs)

576
01:18:34,758 --> 01:18:37,344
Now, you take a good look.

577
01:18:38,971 --> 01:18:42,308
Even if you kill me,
Marston'll catch ya. He's coming for ya.

578
01:18:42,391 --> 01:18:47,062
l ain't gonna kill ya. Cos you're gonna
go tell Marston l'm coming after him.

579
01:18:48,606 --> 01:18:50,399
Now git.

580
01:19:04,038 --> 01:19:06,415
Get here. Get here quick!

581
01:19:13,964 --> 01:19:17,009
- Don't bother to knock, will you?
- Quigley's coming.

582
01:19:17,092 --> 01:19:18,886
He's killed Paddy and Oliver.

583
01:19:18,969 --> 01:19:22,515
Quigley said to tell you he's coming
for you. He'll get us all.

584
01:19:22,598 --> 01:19:25,059
Oh, shut up.

585
01:19:26,018 --> 01:19:29,146
One man and he's beaten all of you.

586
01:19:32,358 --> 01:19:35,361
Brophy, you and Mitchell
ride with me as far as the gap.

587
01:19:35,444 --> 01:19:39,657
Dobkin, get every available man.
l'll find Ashley-Pitt.

588
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:40,699
Yes, sir.

589
01:19:40,825 --> 01:19:44,578
And get him out of here.
He's bleeding all over the rug.

590
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:33,252
Lady?

591
01:20:34,044 --> 01:20:37,047
- (Cora gasps)
- No, no. lt's all right.

592
01:20:39,175 --> 01:20:40,885
What happened?

593
01:20:40,968 --> 01:20:42,970
(Cora groans)

594
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:46,474
Comanches came.

595
01:20:48,767 --> 01:20:51,437
But Little Bitty's just fine.

596
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,648
l killed the Comanches, and he's just...

597
01:20:54,732 --> 01:20:57,276
He's just fine, honey.

598
01:21:03,657 --> 01:21:06,035
You're quite a woman, Cora.

599
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:15,753
You get any sage hens?

600
01:21:19,632 --> 01:21:23,052
l got the next best thing.

601
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:29,725
They didn't have a red one.

602
01:21:29,809 --> 01:21:31,685
Oh.

603
01:21:31,894 --> 01:21:34,021
Oh.

604
01:21:34,146 --> 01:21:37,608
No matter. ls it pretty?

605
01:21:38,067 --> 01:21:40,694
Looks good on me.

606
01:21:46,283 --> 01:21:48,828
- (Cora) l missed you.
- You did?

607
01:21:51,705 --> 01:21:53,958
Who'd you miss?

608
01:21:54,041 --> 01:21:57,336
- You.
- Me? Not that other fella?

609
01:21:58,295 --> 01:22:00,089
You.

610
01:22:03,425 --> 01:22:05,845
l don't want you to go.

611
01:22:06,804 --> 01:22:09,181
You sure look pretty
in that new blue dress.

612
01:22:09,306 --> 01:22:12,184
lf you go after Marston, he'll kill you.

613
01:22:12,226 --> 01:22:17,231
Kid, next time she talks like that,
pee all over the dress.

614
01:23:11,952 --> 01:23:14,955
You have every right
to your happiness, Cora.

615
01:23:26,675 --> 01:23:28,636
(man talking Aborigine)

616
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:32,056
(speaks Aborigine)

617
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:12,721
(old man speaks Aborigine)

618
01:24:29,822 --> 01:24:31,782
(Cora sighs)

619
01:25:32,468 --> 01:25:35,137
l don't suppose l can convince you.

620
01:25:35,805 --> 01:25:37,765
No, sir.

621
01:25:37,848 --> 01:25:40,851
l will see to it that
she gets out of here safely.

622
01:25:53,989 --> 01:25:55,991
Thank you.

623
01:26:14,677 --> 01:26:18,848
You know something, lady?
l ain't figured you out yet.

624
01:26:18,931 --> 01:26:23,394
Good. Crazy people are blessed that way,
don't you know?

625
01:26:25,896 --> 01:26:28,691
l'll never see you again, will l?

626
01:26:40,744 --> 01:26:43,706
You sure look pretty in the morning sun.

627
01:27:32,463 --> 01:27:34,882
Bye.

628
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:09,583
Everything ready?

629
01:28:09,667 --> 01:28:14,463
There are two men at the front, one at the
back. Scotty's riding up to patrol the ridge.

630
01:28:14,547 --> 01:28:17,049
Mr Marston, the men were wondering

631
01:28:17,133 --> 01:28:21,262
if the man who kills Quigley
will get the £200 in gold.

632
01:28:21,387 --> 01:28:23,764
The reward you posted.

633
01:28:25,349 --> 01:28:27,977
Who asked you about it?

634
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:29,854
Cavanagh.

635
01:28:31,105 --> 01:28:34,150
Have Cavanagh guard the front porch.

636
01:28:35,109 --> 01:28:37,903
Tell him to wear my coat and hat.

637
01:28:54,503 --> 01:28:56,505
(gunshot)

638
01:28:56,589 --> 01:28:58,674
Marston. He's around the back.

639
01:28:58,757 --> 01:29:00,676
- What is he doing?
- (gunshot)

640
01:29:00,759 --> 01:29:04,889
Emptying his revolver.
He wants it freshly loaded for the night.

641
01:29:04,972 --> 01:29:08,434
- Do you think he's losing his cabbage?
- (distant gunshot)

642
01:29:14,148 --> 01:29:16,150
(distant gunshot)

643
01:29:23,657 --> 01:29:26,994
(distant rifle shot)

644
01:29:29,997 --> 01:29:32,458
Maybe Scotty's got Quigley.

645
01:30:17,586 --> 01:30:22,633
''Anyone can leave safely before dawn
except Marston. Most cordially, Quigley.''

646
01:30:22,716 --> 01:30:25,052
He must think l'm stupid.

647
01:30:25,136 --> 01:30:29,098
This means he's gonna try and spring
something on us during the night.

648
01:30:29,181 --> 01:30:31,725
All right. Nobody sleeps.

649
01:30:33,102 --> 01:30:35,062
Give me that.

650
01:30:52,204 --> 01:30:54,832
(imitates gunshots)

651
01:31:14,518 --> 01:31:16,979
Stay awake.

652
01:31:25,905 --> 01:31:27,865
Marston!

653
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:31,202
Mr Marston!

654
01:31:35,831 --> 01:31:38,375
- They're gone.
- What?

655
01:31:38,459 --> 01:31:42,254
- Three men ran off. Giniven, Kelly...
- Why didn't you stop them?

656
01:31:48,135 --> 01:31:50,179
Where is he?

657
01:31:50,304 --> 01:31:53,474
(Dobkin) He's gotta be way up there,
in the cutting.

658
01:31:56,685 --> 01:31:58,771
So much for Cavanagh's reward.

659
01:31:58,854 --> 01:32:04,318
That bastard's been sitting waiting
for two idiots to line up in his sights.

660
01:32:05,653 --> 01:32:07,655
All right.

661
01:32:07,738 --> 01:32:10,783
We'll do the last thing Quigley expects.

662
01:32:41,939 --> 01:32:44,066
Come on. Yaah!

663
01:33:02,126 --> 01:33:05,129
He's cleared off.
Let's get back to the station.

664
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:24,732
Get up there.

665
01:34:35,219 --> 01:34:37,721
l'm hurt, Quigley. l'll do you no harm.

666
01:34:37,805 --> 01:34:40,599
Throw that hogleg away. Easy.

667
01:34:52,570 --> 01:34:55,447
On your feet.

668
01:34:55,531 --> 01:34:57,533
(gunshot)

669
01:34:58,117 --> 01:35:00,119
(gunshots)

670
01:35:21,348 --> 01:35:23,350
Jesus!

671
01:35:32,109 --> 01:35:36,363
Brophy, get round to the side.
lt'll make it harder for him. l'll cover you.

672
01:35:36,447 --> 01:35:39,241
This rock's covering me fine.

673
01:35:40,576 --> 01:35:43,370
Move, you gutless bloody wonder.

674
01:36:10,022 --> 01:36:11,982
Close in on him.

675
01:36:40,928 --> 01:36:42,471
Brophy!

676
01:37:14,044 --> 01:37:17,506
l can bounce the next one
clean through ya. How brave are ya?

677
01:37:20,050 --> 01:37:22,052
l'm coming out.

678
01:37:24,889 --> 01:37:27,266
That ain't real brave but it is smart.

679
01:37:30,728 --> 01:37:32,354
(laughs)

680
01:37:41,197 --> 01:37:44,533
l got him! l got Quigley!

681
01:38:12,895 --> 01:38:15,940
Got a gift for you, Mr Marston.
Quigley, alive.

682
01:38:16,023 --> 01:38:19,318
- Half alive.
- Good work, you two.

683
01:38:28,452 --> 01:38:30,037
(groans)

684
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,251
Well, well, well.

685
01:38:35,334 --> 01:38:40,339
Mr Quigley... good of you to drop in again.

686
01:38:44,135 --> 01:38:47,138
What? Nothing clever to say?

687
01:38:51,642 --> 01:38:53,227
The great Quigley.

688
01:38:54,353 --> 01:38:57,022
This is what you were all afraid of.

689
01:38:58,524 --> 01:39:01,068
Bring him over here and stand him up.

690
01:39:10,661 --> 01:39:12,621
Stand up.

691
01:39:13,998 --> 01:39:16,000
Cut him loose.

692
01:39:25,259 --> 01:39:30,514
Now put his rifle...
on the ground in front of him.

693
01:39:41,108 --> 01:39:43,360
No.

694
01:39:44,278 --> 01:39:46,197
Throw it away.

695
01:39:49,909 --> 01:39:52,912
O'Flynn, go and get my second revolver.

696
01:39:54,038 --> 01:39:57,208
l know how much you would like
to have your rifle with you,

697
01:39:57,291 --> 01:40:01,253
but l think you'll find that
l've got a much better idea.

698
01:40:03,339 --> 01:40:05,758
Stick it in his belt.

699
01:40:05,841 --> 01:40:08,219
Go on!

700
01:40:14,266 --> 01:40:20,439
You're not too familiar with Colonel Colt's
revolver, so this will be your first lesson.

701
01:40:20,523 --> 01:40:25,694
Don't worry. Mr Dobkin and Mr O'Flynn
will ensure that it's a fair contest.

702
01:40:32,076 --> 01:40:35,246
l'll just back up a few paces.

703
01:40:38,415 --> 01:40:41,710
And to your left a bit. That's it.

704
01:40:42,253 --> 01:40:44,964
Now you're right in front
of my old pistol target.

705
01:40:49,301 --> 01:40:52,429
Some men are born in the wrong century.

706
01:40:55,099 --> 01:40:58,144
l think l was born on the wrong continent.

707
01:41:02,148 --> 01:41:04,650
By the way, you're fired.

708
01:41:20,875 --> 01:41:23,794
This ain't Dodge City.

709
01:41:23,878 --> 01:41:26,464
And you ain't Bill Hickok.

710
01:42:11,884 --> 01:42:16,388
l said l never had much use for one.
Never said l didn't know how to use it.

711
01:45:24,869 --> 01:45:28,205
(Ashley-Pitt)
Somewhat the worse for wear,

712
01:45:28,289 --> 01:45:31,375
this appears to be Quigley.

713
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:37,882
l think you have a lot to explain, sir.
Not that it will do you any good. Sergeant.

714
01:45:39,592 --> 01:45:43,387
ln pursuance of a warrant,
duly attested by a justice of the peace,

715
01:45:43,471 --> 01:45:48,392
you are hereby charged with numerous
and serious crimes, including murder...

716
01:45:48,476 --> 01:45:54,899
ln short, this paperwork
says we can hang you.

717
01:45:56,484 --> 01:45:59,653
l ain't gonna swing on no gallows.

718
01:46:00,529 --> 01:46:02,656
Well.

719
01:46:02,740 --> 01:46:06,952
You can always be shot...
on the way to your trial.

720
01:46:07,495 --> 01:46:10,873
While trying to escape, of course.

721
01:46:10,956 --> 01:46:15,961
Or you can die here, bearing arms against
the army of Her Majesty the Queen.

722
01:46:17,296 --> 01:46:19,131
The decision...

723
01:46:19,215 --> 01:46:21,217
(distant rumbling)

724
01:49:30,114 --> 01:49:34,118
- When's the next boat leaving?
- For Europe or the Americas?

725
01:49:35,369 --> 01:49:37,163
America.

726
01:49:39,248 --> 01:49:41,250
Let's see here.

727
01:49:43,335 --> 01:49:47,548
l've got one leaving
this afternoon for San Francisco.

728
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:52,344
Your name, sir?

729
01:50:08,110 --> 01:50:10,362
Name?

730
01:50:11,822 --> 01:50:13,782
Roy.

731
01:50:15,409 --> 01:50:17,620
Roy Cobb.

732
01:50:25,377 --> 01:50:27,338
How many?

733
01:50:28,464 --> 01:50:30,049
Two.

734
01:50:37,389 --> 01:50:39,558
l got something l wanna say to you.

735
01:50:39,642 --> 01:50:43,312
l got a couple of things
l wanna say to you, too.

736
01:50:43,395 --> 01:50:48,692
Remember once you told me before you'd
make love to me l had to say two words?

737
01:50:48,776 --> 01:50:50,569
What's that?

738
01:50:50,653 --> 01:50:52,655
Matthew Quigley.

739
01:54:34,168 --> 01:54:37,171
