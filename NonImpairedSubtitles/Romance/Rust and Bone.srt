1
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:54,750
I'm hungry.

2
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,292
I'm hungry.

3
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:37,167
You want some?

4
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,750
Don't.

5
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,750
Stop it.

6
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,125
Sam?

7
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:28,583
This one has better image quality.
Nikon is good.

8
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,958
These are professional cameras.
I'll show you something.

9
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:39,042
Sir!

10
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,333
Take one yourself.

11
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,708
Tired?
- No.

12
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,292
Are you Ali? Hop in.

13
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:26,583
Finally, I'd say.
- I drove around for an hour.

14
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,208
Slide through.
- I meant to call Anna already.

15
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:34,333
Nice van I have, huh?
You find it really nice, huh?

16
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,458
Because God forbid someone
doesn't like my van.

17
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,833
Do you want it?

18
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,292
Nice chap.

19
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:48,833
Eight drivers on the road.
After some conversations with Anna ...

20
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,458
I thought: I'm going on my own.

21
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,958
Then I bought this van.

22
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,125
What's that for?
- To eat outside when it's hot.

23
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:08,208
There is plenty of sun.
- I'm still holding.

24
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,667
Look, look.

25
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:20,125
You see the dogs?
Those are Aunt Anna's.

26
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:25,875
Whose car parts are those?
- Neighbor Che's

27
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:28,542
who moonlights with this.

28
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,625
Very handy.

29
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:43,792
Say when.
From this you become a big boy.

30
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,708
How long haven't you seen Anna?

31
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,708
A year, or five.

32
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,542
That long?

33
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:54,042
Where does she work?
- In a supermarket.

34
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:57,208
As a cashier?
- Yes, exactly.

35
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:05,125
No, from the top stack.
Those are the furthest past date.

36
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,000
They are on date,
from top to bottom.

37
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:11,833
I grab one here? You too?

38
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,125
Anna takes them home from work.

39
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:21,458
In the shop they are discarded.
But they are still good for a week.

40
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,417
Do you earn well?
- What can I say ...

41
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,458
We can get by.
- What exactly do you do?

42
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:35,458
I deliver frozen products.
Mainly fish, but also other things.

43
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,417
That depends on the offer.

44
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,917
More coffee?

45
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,167
Tasty, yes.

46
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,042
He looks like you.

47
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,458
Is that all?
Doesn't your brother get a kiss?

48
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,042
All is well?

49
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:26,667
Are those all his things?
She thought of his passport.

50
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,750
No, that was still in there accidentally.

51
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:34,000
In his bag they smuggled
dope back from Amsterdam.

52
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:36,708
She told me that.

53
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,708
How will you take care of him?
Because Richard and I don't have time.

54
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,208
Did he do well at school?

55
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,250
Don't you know that
your son went to school?

56
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:52,167
Sam, you went to school at your mom's?
- Yes.

57
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:58,000
I'll try to register him nearby.
He needs new clothes.

58
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,500
I'll just drop in on the neighbors.

59
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:07,917
Shall I wake you in an hour? Door closed?
- Don't.

60
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,958
Want some cake? Okay.

61
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,667
Here, help yourself.

62
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,125
You watch them? I'll be right back.
Careful with them.

63
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:33,292
He licked me.
- They can't run away.

64
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,625
Won't you eat?

65
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,208
They are beautiful, huh?

66
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,333
I got them from a breeder.

67
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,333
In a month he takes them.
So we earn a little.

68
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,375
Everything alright with you?
- I'm exhausted.

69
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,500
He doesn't remember.
- Wait.

70
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:09,125
Looks can be deceiving sometimes.
To go to your work.

71
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:12,500
Are you shitting me?
- No.

72
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,292
Che?

73
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:19,250
Where is the toolbox?
- In the garage.

74
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:21,708
Would you like some help?

75
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,000
Stop it, you idiot.

76
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,750
When is Mommy coming?
- Soon.

77
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:02,708
Soon ...

78
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,167
When is Mommy coming?
- Soon, I told you.

79
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,500
When is that?
- I don't know.

80
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:22,000
Where did you work last?
- In a slaughterhouse. That was closed down.

81
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:28,083
But never in security?
- Yes, half a year in a stadium.

82
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,292
As a night watchman.
And in a parking garage.

83
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:37,333
Have you done martial arts?
- Six years and two years Thai boxing.

84
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:43,708
Can you prove that?
With photos or a license?

85
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:47,417
I was regional champion in Belgium.

86
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,125
I have a belt.

87
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,625
Have you stopped?
- No, my trainer has stopped.

88
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,792
Why?
- He's dead.

89
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,167
You don't smoke?
- No.

90
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,750
And you don't drink?

91
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,583
I didn't hear anything.
- No, I don't drink.

92
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,625
Drugs?
- No.

93
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:11,125
Why should I hire you?

94
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,792
Trust me.

95
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,500
Right. And what is this?

96
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:22,250
Hello.

97
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,542
And?
- In a week he'll hear from me.

98
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,625
Is that his son?
- Yes.

99
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:33,167
You didn't say you had a child?
- I didn't ask either.

100
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,167
Did you hear from that customer yet?
- You have cold hands.

101
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,167
Good evening.

102
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:52,042
Okay, you win.
For four girls, I am no match.

103
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,250
Good night.

104
00:12:57,542 --> 00:13:01,375
It's that easy.
You just chat with them ...

105
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:08,875
If you're lucky, they are drunk or frustrated.
Then you say something nice ...

106
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:10,667
Does that work?
- You bet.

107
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:36,667
Get out, you guys. Buzz off.

108
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:46,542
Are you OK? Keep your head back.

109
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,958
Good. Breathe slowly.

110
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,583
The bastard.

111
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,208
Breathe slowly.

112
00:13:56,375 --> 00:14:00,000
I have to go home.
- Are there any of your friends inside?

113
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:03,375
No, and I'm here by car.

114
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:06,500
You can't drive like this.
I'll call you a cab.

115
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:10,750
No, I need my car.
Nice of you, thanks.

116
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:14,458
What a slut you are.
- What did you do?

117
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,000
Shut up.

118
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,708
Crap.

119
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:23,333
Still bleeding?
- Not anymore.

120
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,292
Damn

121
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:33,792
Did you hurt yourself?
- Yes, it is swollen. Look.

122
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:45,417
You come to the Annexe often?

123
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,583
Why do you come alone?

124
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,208
To dance?

125
00:14:57,042 --> 00:15:00,167
To pick up a guy?
- You think?

126
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:05,125
You don't dress like that
just to dance.

127
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:09,083
What am I dressed like?
- I don't know ...

128
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,125
You see ...
- What?

129
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,333
You look like a whore.

130
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:22,875
I'm sorry?

131
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,792
How do you call that?
- That's enough.

132
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,750
It doesn't surprise me that guys ...
- Shut up.

133
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,458
How do you get back?
- Will see.

134
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,958
Never mind.
- For a taxi.

135
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,583
Don't. Here ...

136
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,250
Goodbye.
- Do you have ice in the house?

137
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:50,833
Why?
- Ice cubes.

138
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,000
Wait here. I'll check.

139
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:57,250
I can come along.
- No.

140
00:15:57,417 --> 00:16:00,042
There is someone upstairs.
- So what?

141
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,042
Wait here. I'll be right back.

142
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,875
Alright.

143
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:11,042
Come in.

144
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,667
Steph?
- Here are ice cubes.

145
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,083
What happened to you?

146
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,375
There was a slugfest.
- Are you okay?

147
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:28,833
Hello.
- Who is that?

148
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,958
The bouncer at the Annexe.
He brought me home.

149
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,750
What did you do at the Annexe?
What are you doing?

150
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:38,625
I'm packing ice.
- He has a sore hand.

151
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,375
Can I talk to you for a moment?

152
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,875
No, you should see how you get home.

153
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,625
Mind your own business.

154
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,542
Is it better?
- Yes.

155
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,042
Is that you in the photos with the orcas?

156
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,500
Is that your work?

157
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:34,917
I wouldn't have thought that.
- Can't whores train orcas?

158
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,083
You're nuts.

159
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,792
Aren't you gone yet?

160
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,125
Are you talking to me?

161
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:49,875
Please go.

162
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,792
Here is my number, just in case.

163
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:10,333
Are you OK?
- Yes.

164
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,333
You are angry.

165
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,208
No.

166
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:24,500
I saw your face just now though.
- Just now?

167
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:27,833
With that guy from the Annexe.

168
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,417
I saw how small you were.
- I was small?

169
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,833
For sure.

170
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,458
You aren't commanding me anymore, Simon.

171
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:42,583
What do you mean?
- That you don't give me commands any more. Period.

172
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,917
Careful, Steph.

173
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:10,542
Sam, come away from that pen.

174
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,500
Come out, that's disgusting.

175
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,458
Come out.

176
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:37,125
Come out. Shit, you're filthy.

177
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:42,375
Do not touch me. Walk.
Anna?

178
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:46,042
Off those pants.

179
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:50,167
You smell like shit.
Up those arms.

180
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,542
Come here.

181
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,708
Stay like this.

182
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,000
What are you doing?
- Did you watch him?

183
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:09,333
Yeah, I just hung the laundry.
- Hold on.

184
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,458
Don't cry, you.
- Act normal.

185
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,917
Where is my sister?
- The van had a breakdown.

186
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:18,042
Look at that.
- Come, I'll wash you.

187
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,917
You stay out of that doghouse.

188
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,917
Is somebody there?

189
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,000
Steph ...

190
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,917
Wait ...

191
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:01,250
What happened to my legs?

192
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:05,625
What happened to my legs?

193
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:19,417
What happened to my legs?

194
00:27:50,292 --> 00:27:53,167
I had your brothers on the phone.

195
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:57,458
They wanted to talk to you,
but that seemed a little too early.

196
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:01,625
Hugo is coming the next holiday.

197
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:26,333
She is devastated.
They don't dare to come.

198
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:54,167
Give me that.

199
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,375
Let go.

200
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,833
Please.

201
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,000
What do you want with it?

202
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:02,208
I'll take you.
You need to get out of here.

203
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,667
No, there is no point.

204
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:17,083
Right.

205
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,167
Very good. Now left.

206
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,125
Left, right.

207
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:26,000
Stay in the middle. Not too much ...

208
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:28,875
Your cover.

209
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:43,125
You are too static.

210
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:45,958
How are you?
- And you, Foued?

211
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:48,000
Hello.
- Ali.

212
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:49,792
See you soon!

213
00:31:13,292 --> 00:31:15,292
Hi!

214
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:35,792
Wait a moment.

215
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:46,292
You forgot Sam.
- I'm still at the gym.

216
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:48,458
I'm going already.

217
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:52,250
I'm telling you I'm going.

218
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:13,625
Mister van Versch, can I talk to you for a moment?

219
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:18,000
Sorry, ma'am.
I was still at work.

220
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:21,250
This is the third time in two weeks.

221
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:24,875
The next time
I'll have to call the police.

222
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:26,750
Sam, come here.

223
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,792
Hop through, stupid beast.

224
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:44,167
Don't you like dogs?
- No.

225
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:49,333
Great, he does not like acorns.
- Move it. What is with that creature?

226
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,750
And it stinks too.

227
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:17,667
Am I speaking with Ali?
- Yes. Who is this?

228
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:19,917
Stephanie.

229
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:24,000
Do you remember?
The Annexe, the brawl, the ice ...

230
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:27,583
Yes, of course. How are you?

231
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:33,083
You know what happened?
- I saw it on TV, yes.

232
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:37,333
So how would I be, what do you think?

233
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,375
I don’t know.

234
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:45,875
And you, all good?
- Yes, the usual.

235
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:52,625
Are you still a bouncer?
- No, watchman, four times a week.

236
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:43,042
I'm here.

237
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:51,625
Come in.

238
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:59,833
Have you been here long?
- I just arrived.

239
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,167
Didn't you ring?
- No.

240
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,542
Sit down.

241
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:14,542
Want something to drink? Coffee?

242
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:19,875
I only got Nescafe.
- That's fine. Shall I help?

243
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:21,792
No.

244
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:31,417
Have you lived here long?
- Since ...

245
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:36,417
A month or two, three, four, I think.

246
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:38,333
Nice place.

247
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,250
It is temporary, because ...

248
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:43,750
Let me.

249
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:45,667
Give it to me.

250
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:49,042
The insurance pays.

251
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:52,542
Do you have anyone to help you?

252
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:55,583
With what? Walking?

253
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,875
No, the household and all that.

254
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:02,292
Yes, all kinds of people come along.

255
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,292
Are you OK?

256
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,042
Are you OK?

257
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:49,667
Do you think it stinks?
- A little bit.

258
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,667
I think I stink.

259
00:36:57,792 --> 00:37:00,042
Come outside.

260
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:07,792
Yes, put this on.
- No.

261
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:10,667
Yeah, let's go outside.
- No.

262
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:25,417
Be careful!

263
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:40,833
No, don't push. I feel sick.

264
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,292
I do it myself.

265
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:42,667
I feel like swimming.

266
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:46,417
Don't you?

267
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,333
Don't you have a bathing suit?

268
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:58,208
Do you realize what you're saying?
- There's nobody here.

269
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,792
I'm going in.

270
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,542
I'm going in too.

271
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,500
Can you give me that towel?

272
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,958
Ready.

273
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:15,875
And now?
- You have to carry me.

274
00:41:16,042 --> 00:41:18,167
Hold on.

275
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,500
Don't let me go suddenly.

276
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Are you OK?

277
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,792
Ho ...

278
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:23,458
Shit, that was nice.

279
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:30,250
Thank you.

280
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,917
I don't wear that any more.

281
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,750
Garbage.

282
00:45:13,792 --> 00:45:18,500
Garbage, garbage.
- You are throwing good things away.

283
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:22,292
You can wear that dress with pants just fine.

284
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,000
You find this so beautiful?

285
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:31,167
You find this dress so beautiful?

286
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:33,542
You can have it.

287
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:47,167
I like this one.

288
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:51,792
Holy shit. See those hulks?
- Fuck, I say.

289
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:57,333
Against him I fought matches.
Twice. He was not bad.

290
00:45:58,417 --> 00:46:02,333
Knee, right, right.
More right, like that ...

291
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:10,000
What do you want?
- To come inside.

292
00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:13,208
Who's this?

293
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:18,125
Are you Martial?
- I know him. He's a colleague.

294
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:48,250
He goes down.
- It's not over yet.

295
00:46:48,417 --> 00:46:52,958
Right, right. He is an executioner.
How much does he weigh? 80, 90 pounds?

296
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:57,000
No, not 90.
- Surely 85. Look ...

297
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:01,667
He's demolishing him!
Why don't they stop?

298
00:47:01,833 --> 00:47:07,208
He's coming back.
- Look, a knee thrust. And another one.

299
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:10,000
Do you like it?
- What?

300
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:12,458
Fighting.
- Yes.

301
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:17,458
Can you fight?
- Reasonably, yes.

302
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:22,542
Did you fight matches?
- Long ago, boxing and Thai boxing.

303
00:47:23,792 --> 00:47:27,000
Would you like to earn money?

304
00:47:27,167 --> 00:47:31,667
Are you shitting me?
- I know someone who organizes fights.

305
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:35,750
A gypsy. With gambling and everything.

306
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:38,208
How do you know him?

307
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:42,375
I had cameras installed
in a garage where he stole cars.

308
00:47:42,542 --> 00:47:45,542
He wanted the tapes from me.

309
00:47:50,458 --> 00:47:55,333
What kind of boxing?
Thai boxing with your legs?

310
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:00,000
No, you can use anything:
Elbows, knees.

311
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:03,333
You really finish each other.

312
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,958
Who remains last, wins.
You are almost choking me.

313
00:48:12,875 --> 00:48:15,708
Are you going first?
- Yes.

314
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,250
Aren't you afraid?
- Of what?

315
00:48:24,917 --> 00:48:28,208
How much does it pay?
- I don't know.

316
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:32,500
Five hundred, one thousand.
Depends on whether I win.

317
00:48:33,542 --> 00:48:36,500
Will you do it for 500 euros?
- Yes.

318
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:40,208
Put your health at risk
for 500 euros?

319
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,458
Don't exaggerate.

320
00:48:47,208 --> 00:48:52,417
You get 500 euros from me
tomorrow if you don't do it.

321
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:56,833
If you have too much money ...
But I have agreed already.

322
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,125
You don't do it for the money?
- I wouldn't say that.

323
00:49:02,292 --> 00:49:05,375
Well then.
- Don't bother.

324
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:08,250
I do it for the fighting, for fun.

325
00:49:08,417 --> 00:49:12,542
Just like you with your fish.
You did that for fun too.

326
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:15,333
And for the money.

327
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,458
You see how it ends.
- Stop it.

328
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:24,750
Where is your cart?

329
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:30,083
When you are fighting, can I come?

330
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,458
Yes, sure.

331
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:56,417
I make two prints for prosthetics
so at least you can walk.

332
00:49:56,583 --> 00:50:02,208
Later we will look at what you get as
knee joint, pneumatic or electronic.

333
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:07,125
What is an electronic hinge?
- It fixates itself.

334
00:50:07,292 --> 00:50:10,583
Can the feet move?
- No, not the feet.

335
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:14,458
They are flexible carbon fiber,
but not moving.

336
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:17,417
Then I walk like a robot.
- Of course not.

337
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:21,208
There are Swedish feet
that are not reimbursed ...

338
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:26,042
but with those you can wear
heels from 10 to 50 mm.

339
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:28,792
That is important for women.

340
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:38,042
Oh shoot

341
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:41,417
Stop. Good.

342
00:50:47,667 --> 00:50:50,542
Go. I'll take a cab.

343
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:51,792
Of course not.

344
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:27,000
Keep an eye on Sam.
The breeder is there.

345
00:51:32,542 --> 00:51:35,375
Hello? Watch your son?
- Yeah, yeah.

346
00:51:35,542 --> 00:51:38,125
He should not be in the garden.

347
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:46,000
Stay with Daddy.

348
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:50,333
Sit here.
- You have cold hands.

349
00:51:56,542 --> 00:51:58,750
Don't touch it.

350
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,917
Did you see that?

351
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:15,833
See how strong he is?
- Who?

352
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,458
The black pants.

353
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,708
Wait. Sit here.

354
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:30,292
What did he say?

355
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:36,667
Why, 'others'?

356
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:39,333
How many are there?

357
00:52:40,792 --> 00:52:43,000
That was not the intention.

358
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:46,542
Then you fight yourself.

359
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,500
Where do the dogs go?

360
00:52:57,667 --> 00:52:59,208
Go inside.

361
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:02,208
That I don't give a fuck about.

362
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,000
What did I ask you for?
- I'm on the phone.

363
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:10,542
Watch your fucking kid.
Come back here, you.

364
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,417
What is this shit?
I'll call you back.

365
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:18,042
Watch your fucking kid.

366
00:53:18,208 --> 00:53:20,417
Quiet, you.

367
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:24,708
Now you calm down.

368
00:53:24,875 --> 00:53:28,083
I hate you. Do you know that?

369
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:35,708
Come.

370
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:38,750
He has nothing.
- Get out, you.

371
00:53:38,917 --> 00:53:42,000
Hands off and get lost.
- He has nothing.

372
00:53:42,167 --> 00:53:46,500
Don't touch him and get lost.

373
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,333
It's over.

374
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:12,208
Martial, careful.
- Put her belt on then.

375
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:14,750
Fasten your belt.

376
00:54:26,292 --> 00:54:28,375
Who is she?
- His girlfriend.

377
00:54:28,542 --> 00:54:30,958
Okay. Go ahead.

378
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:45,250
That guy is imitating the TV.

379
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,792
Who are those guys?

380
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:51,875
Dealers, figures with money.

381
00:54:57,667 --> 00:55:00,708
Are you OK?
- Yes, fine.

382
00:55:06,792 --> 00:55:10,250
In case of problems lie down.
- How much are the bets?

383
00:55:10,417 --> 00:55:14,542
Over 2000. In the finale it gets more.

384
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:17,667
And what do I do?
- No women, you stay in the car.

385
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:20,917
Are you ready? Ali?

386
00:56:20,792 --> 00:56:23,042
That was quick.

387
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,500
Do you have to go again?
- What?

388
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,125
Yes, soon.

389
00:56:37,292 --> 00:56:38,792
I'll run a bit.

390
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:48,167
Damn ...

391
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:52,000
Stop right there. I want to tidy up.

392
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:14,792
What is that?
- For whom is that?

393
00:59:14,958 --> 00:59:17,375
For the little one.

394
00:59:18,417 --> 00:59:20,750
You have a child?
- Yes.

395
00:59:20,917 --> 00:59:23,000
So drive.

396
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:51,042
And if you're there, he gets hit.
- Don't exaggerate.

397
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:56,042
But you beat him lately?
- Accidentally. He's not dead.

398
00:59:56,208 --> 01:00:01,083
I don't understand why you have taken
him with you. He was better off there.

399
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,167
For you.

400
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:06,750
For what?
- For the past and the future.

401
01:00:06,917 --> 01:00:10,125
How did you get that?
- I won a fight.

402
01:00:10,292 --> 01:00:12,792
What fight?

403
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:18,125
Is that your work? Get beaten up?
- Do you take it or not?

404
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:21,042
Don't look like that, damn.

405
01:00:30,542 --> 01:00:32,792
I cheated.

406
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:37,000
Do you like it?

407
01:00:38,875 --> 01:00:42,042
Do you like it?
- Yes, Ali.

408
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:55,167
Shall we go swimming?
- Yes, Ali.

409
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:07,167
Give daddy a kiss.
- No point.

410
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:09,792
Give daddy a kiss.
- No.

411
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:14,125
No, I don't want to.

412
01:01:23,667 --> 01:01:25,708
Shut up.

413
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:28,917
Damn.

414
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:20,792
Put it there.

415
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:31,125
Yes, and now come back.

416
01:02:31,292 --> 01:02:33,333
Come.

417
01:02:36,167 --> 01:02:41,083
This is not for watching the customers,
but the staff.

418
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:45,917
As a manager of a supermarket ...

419
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:49,917
you have too many staff around.
What do you do?

420
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:53,917
I fire them.
- You need a reason for that.

421
01:02:54,083 --> 01:03:00,667
So find out who pauses or is on the toilet
too long or smokes in the corner.

422
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:06,750
When you know, build up pressure.
Those who don't quit on their own, you fire.

423
01:03:06,917 --> 01:03:10,208
That's what my cameras are for.

424
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:15,375
I work for the managers, for
bosses in their three-piece suits.

425
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:21,042
It's overwhelming. There is no big
supermarket without my cameras.

426
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:23,042
Is that legal?

427
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:26,208
Legal? Who determines that?

428
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:31,083
But if a manager gets caught,
he has a trial on his ass.

429
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:33,708
And I go to jail.

430
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:45,500
Left, on your left.

431
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:48,000
Wait, I'll wave.

432
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,708
Shit, that's brilliant.

433
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:04,417
How long?
- Two days.

434
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:15,292
Can I see it?

435
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:33,625
We go swimming?

436
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,250
I don't know.

437
01:04:37,417 --> 01:04:41,375
It's different now.
I don't know if I want to undress.

438
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,417
Do you have a girlfriend, a fiancée?
- No.

439
01:04:53,583 --> 01:04:58,542
No love life at all?
- Yes, but no fiancée.

440
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:02,500
Only girls to fuck?

441
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Do you have many flings?
- No.

442
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:17,375
Does it annoy you to talk about it?
- No, I don't care.

443
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,458
And did you have many lovers?

444
01:05:23,542 --> 01:05:25,333
Before?
- Yes.

445
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,167
I was with Simon.

446
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:31,042
Is that all?

447
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:35,208
No, there have been other men.
But not many.

448
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:38,417
I was very ...

449
01:05:39,542 --> 01:05:42,917
I liked it when men looked at me ...

450
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:46,208
when they found me tempting.

451
01:05:47,792 --> 01:05:50,792
That they got excited by me.

452
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:55,000
But I quickly became bored.

453
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,167
And now?

454
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:04,333
Nothing.

455
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:10,417
I can't imagine being together any more.

456
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:14,208
I'm not even sure if it still works.

457
01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:16,917
Don't you feel any more?

458
01:06:17,083 --> 01:06:20,458
I never said that.
Of course I still feel something.

459
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,000
Different subject.

460
01:06:26,917 --> 01:06:31,792
Never mind, I'll do it.
- I don't have my legs for nothing.

461
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,417
Do you want to fuck?

462
01:06:42,542 --> 01:06:44,625
Huh?

463
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:49,167
You want to know if it still works?
Then you fuck.

464
01:06:53,958 --> 01:06:56,458
Just like that?
- Yes.

465
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:05,750
I don't know if I can do it
just like that.

466
01:07:06,875 --> 01:07:09,292
I hear you.

467
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:15,042
Wait ...

468
01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:05,542
Come.

469
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:48,792
Don't you want to kiss me on the mouth?

470
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,292
Ok

471
01:08:51,458 --> 01:08:53,917
Your breasts too?

472
01:09:04,917 --> 01:09:08,458
Careful, you are heavy.
- Now no more talking.

473
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:10,417
Ok

474
01:09:15,042 --> 01:09:17,167
Gently.

475
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,208
Gently.

476
01:09:53,792 --> 01:09:55,875
Are you OK?

477
01:09:57,083 --> 01:09:59,292
Was it good?

478
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:03,333
Does it still work?

479
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:07,125
Yes. No. I don't know.

480
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:13,000
It's different. After a while ...
- I'm out of time. I have to go.

481
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:15,750
No, that's not what I mean.

482
01:10:16,792 --> 01:10:19,500
It's new.
- But was it good?

483
01:10:19,667 --> 01:10:22,125
Yes, it was good.

484
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:28,125
If you like, call me. If I'm OP, I'll come.

485
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:33,958
How do you mean 'OP'?
- Operational. When I can.

486
01:10:35,458 --> 01:10:38,333
So if you are OP ...
- Yes.

487
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,208
What?

488
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:46,833
Nothing. Awesome.

489
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,083
I'm going. Ciao.

490
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:42,875
Thank you. I had missed it.

491
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:51,333
OP?

492
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:30,250
Shit, get dressed.

493
01:15:30,417 --> 01:15:32,292
What is it?
- My sister.

494
01:15:34,292 --> 01:15:38,042
You scared me to death.
- I want to introduce you to a friend.

495
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:42,167
Do you take all girls back home?
- Stephanie, this is my sister.

496
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:45,542
It's the girl from Marineland.

497
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:53,333
The poor child.
- Anna ... Stephanie.

498
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:58,375
Four times.

499
01:15:58,542 --> 01:16:00,458
That's enough.

500
01:16:04,083 --> 01:16:06,542
Is it him?

501
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:11,083
Hello.

502
01:16:24,917 --> 01:16:27,583
How old is he?
- Five.

503
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:32,292
The grapefruit juice is out.
I've got multivitamine juice.

504
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:35,417
Pour some for you?
Or do you prefer tea?

505
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:38,583
I'll make tea.
- Really, you don't need to.

506
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:42,083
Anna, sit down.
- This is fine.

507
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:46,042
Shall we leave?
- Why?

508
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:49,417
That whining about tea.
- She's very nice.

509
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:51,667
Yes, very nice ...

510
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:57,458
She feels inferior as a cashier.
Please.

511
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,667
Thank you.

512
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:13,333
Do you sleep here?

513
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,792
Nice room.

514
01:17:21,125 --> 01:17:23,667
Why are you looking like that?

515
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:26,208
Do you find it scary?

516
01:17:27,667 --> 01:17:30,167
Want to see it?
- Yes.

517
01:17:41,667 --> 01:17:43,875
Does it hurt?

518
01:17:44,042 --> 01:17:45,958
No.

519
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,042
Feel it.

520
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:37,458
With this hand,
I try to disable your arm.

521
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:43,208
Same movement.

522
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:47,375
Good, yes.

523
01:19:46,667 --> 01:19:50,667
Are you OK?
- No, that guy will kill me.

524
01:19:53,167 --> 01:19:54,958
Ready?

525
01:22:50,083 --> 01:22:53,792
Do you want to move?
To dance?

526
01:22:58,208 --> 01:23:00,125
I'll go.

527
01:24:16,625 --> 01:24:19,667
I move along. I'll call you tomorrow, OK?
- What, are you leaving?

528
01:24:19,833 --> 01:24:21,542
Yes, I'm going.

529
01:24:24,792 --> 01:24:28,792
Guys, until next time.
Thank you.

530
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:31,000
See you soon!

531
01:24:52,417 --> 01:24:54,542
Want something to drink?

532
01:24:55,708 --> 01:24:58,250
Will you take a drink from me?

533
01:24:58,417 --> 01:25:00,583
Yes, champagne.

534
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:03,208
Two champagne Mika.

535
01:25:03,375 --> 01:25:08,208
My name is Pierre. And yours?
- My name is Marie.

536
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:10,917
Do you come here often?

537
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:13,167
Occasionally.

538
01:25:35,917 --> 01:25:39,292
Sorry, not tonight. I don't feel like it.

539
01:25:41,917 --> 01:25:45,000
I'm going. Thanks for the drink.

540
01:25:47,625 --> 01:25:50,625
Sorry, I ...
- Sorry for what?

541
01:25:50,792 --> 01:25:53,250
I didn't know ...
- What didn't you know?

542
01:25:53,417 --> 01:25:57,000
I didn't know you ...

543
01:25:57,167 --> 01:26:00,083
no ...
- Bastard.

544
01:27:05,958 --> 01:27:08,167
Everything alright?

545
01:27:15,833 --> 01:27:19,625
Did you guys stay long?
- No idea.

546
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:23,625
How was it?
- As usual.

547
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:33,583
You think this is a normal conversation?

548
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:39,000
I ask how it was with the girl
and you say 'as usual'.

549
01:27:39,167 --> 01:27:41,750
What should I say?

550
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:46,958
Nothing.

551
01:27:47,125 --> 01:27:50,958
Do think it's 'usual' to chat up
someone when I'm with you?

552
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:54,792
What would you say if I did that?
- Nothing.

553
01:27:56,250 --> 01:28:00,083
Would you be that cold?
- Stop it. What is your problem?

554
01:28:02,625 --> 01:28:04,958
What am I to you?

555
01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:08,083
A friend? A little girlfriend?

556
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:10,958
A pal, like the others?

557
01:28:11,125 --> 01:28:13,750
Do you fuck your pals?

558
01:28:22,375 --> 01:28:27,708
To continue, we should do it well.
Then we behave.

559
01:28:28,958 --> 01:28:31,333
I'm talking about tactfulness.

560
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:37,375
You know what that is.
You've always been very tactful with me.

561
01:28:42,792 --> 01:28:45,000
Do we call it off?

562
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:50,583
We go on, but not like animals.

563
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:00,833
What?

564
01:29:03,667 --> 01:29:06,125
I'm OP.

565
01:29:08,583 --> 01:29:11,375
Usually, I am OP.

566
01:29:11,542 --> 01:29:14,500
Why do you look at me like that?

567
01:29:14,667 --> 01:29:17,083
You feel it, yes?

568
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,583
Why not?

569
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:18,750
Calm down or I'll have the store evacuated.

570
01:30:18,917 --> 01:30:23,458
Don't bother.
- We'll call the police ourselves.

571
01:30:23,625 --> 01:30:27,875
Remove the stuff.
- You are spying on your own staff.

572
01:30:31,667 --> 01:30:36,625
Don't you dare even looking at us.
Don't touch me.

573
01:30:36,792 --> 01:30:40,542
He does a criminal offense
and calls the police himself. Bravo.

574
01:30:46,625 --> 01:30:50,542
What are you doing?
- I'm taking everything.

575
01:30:50,708 --> 01:30:53,333
Are these things yours?
- No.

576
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:56,375
No photos.
- Do you work for them?

577
01:30:56,542 --> 01:31:00,042
No pictures, I said.
- Did you film us yet?

578
01:31:00,208 --> 01:31:03,125
Want a blow to your head?

579
01:31:03,292 --> 01:31:05,500
Come on, now.

580
01:31:08,917 --> 01:31:13,417
We got you.
- Shut up.

581
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:19,042
I need a month away or three or four.

582
01:31:19,208 --> 01:31:23,833
Ali wants to continue fighting.
Would you like to replace me?

583
01:31:26,875 --> 01:31:30,917
But does he agree?
- He said it himself.

584
01:31:34,083 --> 01:31:38,000
Why me?
- He trusts you, I suppose.

585
01:31:38,167 --> 01:31:40,875
I don't know that world at all.

586
01:31:42,417 --> 01:31:46,208
Do you see me deal with those barbarians?
- Yes.

587
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:48,458
Really?

588
01:31:49,625 --> 01:31:53,917
Everything is in here.
If you have questions, let me know.

589
01:31:56,167 --> 01:32:00,708
And the bets?
- You have fingers to count.

590
01:32:00,875 --> 01:32:04,208
You mean this Clio? That one?

591
01:32:05,333 --> 01:32:08,667
I noticed that you have a problem ...

592
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:12,292
I want an automatic.
- This is an automatic.

593
01:32:12,458 --> 01:32:14,500
But it's ugly.

594
01:32:46,625 --> 01:32:48,875
RIGHT

595
01:33:36,958 --> 01:33:39,833
What's up, Robocop?
- A circus!

596
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,958
How much is it?
- 3400.

597
01:33:43,125 --> 01:33:45,333
Are you ready?

598
01:34:12,583 --> 01:34:14,667
I'm here.

599
01:34:17,083 --> 01:34:19,917
Don't look like that.
- What are you doing?

600
01:34:20,083 --> 01:34:22,167
I go pee.

601
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:26,792
Give me my T-shirt.
- What time is it?

602
01:34:26,958 --> 01:34:28,917
Six o'clock.

603
01:34:31,708 --> 01:34:34,375
Shit, I've fallen asleep.

604
01:34:35,417 --> 01:34:38,000
I don't want you to see me like this.

605
01:34:38,167 --> 01:34:40,875
Hold me. Come.

606
01:34:54,792 --> 01:34:57,000
Good like this?

607
01:35:09,167 --> 01:35:11,542
What's the matter?

608
01:35:25,542 --> 01:35:28,125
Do it now?

609
01:35:59,583 --> 01:36:02,750
You need to come to the supervisor.
The management.

610
01:36:05,167 --> 01:36:07,625
Wait here.
- Here?

611
01:36:08,708 --> 01:36:10,917
You too?

612
01:36:36,667 --> 01:36:38,583
And?

613
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:43,417
I got fired.
- Calm down. You should see something.

614
01:36:46,542 --> 01:36:52,250
Here he packs up the stuff.
And here he stands up to beat me.

615
01:36:53,542 --> 01:36:58,208
Then he takes off.
But beautiful that I've caught him.

616
01:37:35,958 --> 01:37:38,042
Hi

617
01:37:39,625 --> 01:37:42,125
What are you doing?
- I'm hungry.

618
01:37:42,292 --> 01:37:46,208
Close that refrigerator.
You don't eat here.

619
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:52,125
You don't eat here.
- What's the matter?

620
01:37:53,542 --> 01:37:56,167
I got fired this morning.

621
01:38:06,333 --> 01:38:09,167
What does that have to do with
whether I eat here?

622
01:38:11,917 --> 01:38:16,917
That has to do with the cameras
hanging in the warehouse.

623
01:38:17,083 --> 01:38:20,500
They know we took things
that were expired.

624
01:38:20,667 --> 01:38:23,458
Because of you, your sister was fired.

625
01:38:27,333 --> 01:38:29,667
What does that do with you?

626
01:38:32,083 --> 01:38:34,708
How much did it pay?

627
01:38:34,875 --> 01:38:38,083
Was it per camera or per job?

628
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:44,042
You don't say anything?

629
01:38:45,708 --> 01:38:51,250
I give you shelter and I care for
your child, but you say nothing.

630
01:38:51,417 --> 01:38:52,667
Great.

631
01:38:54,833 --> 01:38:59,208
I couldn't know.
- No. But I don't get you.

632
01:39:00,333 --> 01:39:03,042
How could you do something like that?

633
01:39:04,083 --> 01:39:09,375
Whose side are you on? On their side?
Do you have sawdust in your head?

634
01:39:09,542 --> 01:39:13,917
What didn't you know?
That you'd bring us into shit?

635
01:39:14,083 --> 01:39:16,750
Can't you think?

636
01:39:37,792 --> 01:39:39,917
Calm down, you.

637
01:39:40,083 --> 01:39:42,667
You calm down.

638
01:39:42,833 --> 01:39:45,833
Get your stuff and get out.

639
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,750
You can fuck off. Get out of here.

640
01:41:11,708 --> 01:41:14,667
This is the mess he left behind.

641
01:41:14,833 --> 01:41:17,958
He has recorded that he is in Strasbourg.

642
01:41:18,125 --> 01:41:22,458
Perhaps no longer. Didn't he call you?

643
01:41:22,625 --> 01:41:26,958
Have you been to the gym?
- They too know nothing.

644
01:41:27,125 --> 01:41:32,083
If I hear anything, I'll pass it on.
He will have pulled something stupid.

645
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:35,292
You believe me, do you?

646
01:41:35,458 --> 01:41:37,167
Yes.

647
01:41:37,333 --> 01:41:42,000
He just leaves his child here.
He has shit on everywhere.

648
01:41:42,167 --> 01:41:46,042
You don't know him.
- Oh, no? What did you expect from him?

649
01:41:46,208 --> 01:41:49,292
I don't know. But not this.

650
01:42:50,875 --> 01:42:53,375
Keep moving. Hands up.

651
01:43:04,208 --> 01:43:06,583
Is there any coffee left?

652
01:43:43,417 --> 01:43:45,667
Everything alright?
- Yes. And you?

653
01:43:45,833 --> 01:43:48,167
I don't want to get stuck.

654
01:43:48,333 --> 01:43:51,875
Got a new truck?
- A new boss.

655
01:43:52,042 --> 01:43:53,958
I'm going to get exploited.

656
01:43:56,125 --> 01:43:59,458
Put your jacket on, Sam.
- Everything okay at home?

657
01:43:59,625 --> 01:44:01,917
Yes.

658
01:44:02,083 --> 01:44:04,583
And Anna?
- Good.

659
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:09,542
She works part time in a school canteen.
She likes it.

660
01:44:13,667 --> 01:44:16,458
Does she know this?
- Of course.

661
01:44:17,583 --> 01:44:22,917
Are you saying that I cannot help?
But once I have money ...

662
01:44:23,083 --> 01:44:27,333
It's OK. When will you fight?
- Next month, the 9th.

663
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:30,208
Keep us informed?
- Yes.

664
01:44:30,375 --> 01:44:34,833
Come on, Sam. Here Mr. Sam.

665
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,333
My mittens.
- Kiss.

666
01:44:39,125 --> 01:44:41,542
Handover.

667
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:48,958
I will deliver in Colmar
and get him at 7 o'clock.

668
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,958
Ali, I count on that: Seven o'clock.
I have to get back before eleven.

669
01:44:55,125 --> 01:44:58,250
Alright.
- Have a nice day, you guys.

670
01:44:59,375 --> 01:45:02,458
Sam, listen, make a snowman.

671
01:45:02,625 --> 01:45:06,708
Have a good day.
- I'll bring fries for you.

672
01:45:14,917 --> 01:45:17,417
I also want to skate.

673
01:45:17,583 --> 01:45:20,333
That is called skiing.
- No, skating.

674
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:24,125
No really, skiing.
- Skating.

675
01:45:24,292 --> 01:45:27,542
Skiing.
- You are annoying.

676
01:45:34,833 --> 01:45:37,708
Faster?

677
01:45:37,875 --> 01:45:40,958
I'll let you go. Then you can do it yourself.

678
01:45:41,125 --> 01:45:44,208
Put it on.

679
01:45:44,375 --> 01:45:46,542
Crap.

680
01:46:25,125 --> 01:46:27,958
Careful. Grab the sled.

681
01:46:28,125 --> 01:46:30,208
Sit on it.

682
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:35,333
One, two, three ... departure.

683
01:46:48,417 --> 01:46:50,333
Crap.

684
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:52,625
Again.

685
01:47:00,208 --> 01:47:03,208
We are going back in ten minutes. Okay?

686
01:48:00,167 --> 01:48:01,333
Help

687
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,750
Now we look after you.

688
01:50:07,542 --> 01:50:09,583
Come.

689
01:51:05,375 --> 01:51:08,500
Can you do that?
- Yes, thank you.

690
01:51:30,375 --> 01:51:32,375
Hello?

691
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:37,292
Yes, it's better.

692
01:51:37,458 --> 01:51:40,458
Here he comes himself.

693
01:51:40,625 --> 01:51:42,625
She wants to talk to you.

694
01:51:42,792 --> 01:51:45,167
Anna?
- No.

695
01:51:48,792 --> 01:51:51,000
She's with me.

696
01:51:52,375 --> 01:51:54,833
Do you mind me calling?

697
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,792
No.

698
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:02,042
How is he?

699
01:52:02,208 --> 01:52:05,208
He came to an hour ago.

700
01:52:08,375 --> 01:52:12,125
Is he injured?
- No, I don't think so.

701
01:52:14,083 --> 01:52:16,667
And you?

702
01:52:16,833 --> 01:52:19,875
I got my hands broken
on the ice.

703
01:52:21,792 --> 01:52:24,083
Severely?

704
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:27,042
They are broken.

705
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:36,458
And how are you?

706
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:38,500
Good.

707
01:52:38,667 --> 01:52:43,542
What are you doing?
- At this moment? In life?

708
01:52:43,708 --> 01:52:46,375
Or in general?
- I wanted to say ...

709
01:52:46,542 --> 01:52:50,750
I ask for nothing. I'm hanging up.

710
01:52:50,917 --> 01:52:54,875
I'll call you to ask about Sam.
Give him a kiss.

711
01:52:55,042 --> 01:52:57,208
Don't hang up.

712
01:52:59,292 --> 01:53:02,500
Don't hang up.
- Okay.

713
01:53:10,958 --> 01:53:13,542
For three hours he's been ...

714
01:53:13,708 --> 01:53:16,667
in a coma.

715
01:53:16,833 --> 01:53:19,500
He was dead for three hours.

716
01:53:22,375 --> 01:53:25,333
I was so afraid I would lose him.

717
01:53:31,542 --> 01:53:35,208
Don't let me down.
- I won't.

718
01:53:43,333 --> 01:53:45,708
I love you.

719
01:54:10,958 --> 01:54:13,750
In a human hand there are 27 bones.

720
01:54:15,208 --> 01:54:20,500
Some apes have more.
A gorilla 32, five per finger.

721
01:54:20,667 --> 01:54:22,958
A human has 27.

722
01:54:23,125 --> 01:54:26,208
If you break an arm or a leg ...

723
01:54:26,375 --> 01:54:29,792
the bone grows back together
by calcification.

724
01:54:29,958 --> 01:54:33,792
Your arm or leg can therefore
become even stronger.

725
01:54:33,958 --> 01:54:38,542
But with a hand fracture
it will never get quite right.

726
01:54:41,292 --> 01:54:46,250
In every battle and with
each slap you will think of it.

727
01:54:46,417 --> 01:54:48,625
You'll be careful.

728
01:54:48,792 --> 01:54:52,292
But once in a while the pain will come back.

729
01:54:53,667 --> 01:54:56,042
Like needles.

730
01:54:56,208 --> 01:54:58,708
Like glass splinters.
