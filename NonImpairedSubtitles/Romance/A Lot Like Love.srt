1
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:46,982
Awesome.

2
00:00:52,032 --> 00:00:54,330
Hey, does Mom know you drive like that?

3
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:57,632
Whatever, OK.
Can you get your stuff? I'm missing <i>90210.</i>

4
00:00:57,704 --> 00:00:59,672
You know, you're lucky you have
all that gear in your mouth,

5
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,970
'cause they're gonna need your teeth
to identify your charred remains.

6
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:04,602
- Shut up! You're such a dick!
- Bye, Nicole.

7
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:10,382
- ... time apart. That's all.
- Where is this coming from?

8
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,418
You can come, all right?
It's not...

9
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:15,750
Never mind. You don't want me
to come, I'm not coming.

10
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:18,382
- Fine. Then I want you out. Bye!
- Am I a partner or am I not?

11
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,289
You don't support me.
You don't support me and my band.

12
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,624
I support the band.
I love the band.

13
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:24,994
Just get in the car.

14
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:27,761
Don't hurry back.

15
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:29,563
Come on!

16
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:36,576
You missed a spot right here.

17
00:02:27,694 --> 00:02:29,855
Can I clear these for you, sir?

18
00:02:30,764 --> 00:02:32,595
Will you be wanting any more peanuts?

19
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,066
I think they have another crate
in the galley.

20
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:37,126
Thanks.

21
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:44,343
Oh, dear. All right, then.
I'll just be getting you a towel.

22
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:45,969
Oh, dear, I'm...
Oh, I'm so sorry.

23
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:47,513
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:57,657 --> 00:02:59,852
I'm fine, thank you.

25
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:04,590
There's towels in here.
So I don't really need...

26
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:03,656
- Everything all right, sir?
- Every... Yeah.

27
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:06,021
Everything's good. Thanks.

28
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:23,102
<i>Your attention. Please.</i>

29
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:28,011
<i>There has been a luggage carousel</i>
<i>change for flight 640.</i>

30
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:30,572
<i>It will now be on carousel four.</i>

31
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:34,720
Don't.

32
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:37,449
I'm Oliver.

33
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:41,824
- I just thought we'd chat ab...
- Blah, blah, blah.

34
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:45,888
- See, it's ruined.
- What's ruined?

35
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,630
Our little secret.

36
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:54,600
Actually, I think the stewardess
was kind of onto us, so...

37
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:58,377
Well, she'll have to be killed.

38
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:03,783
- I'm Oliver.
- You keep saying that.

39
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:09,283
Wow.
You don't make it easy for a guy.

40
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:13,315
I think I made it
pretty easy for ya, Oliver.

41
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,185
So, what's Bon Jovi do?

42
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:44,418
- Who?
- The boyfriend.

43
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:47,085
Ex-boyfriend.

44
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,788
Yeah, I noticed that.

45
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:54,089
So, what happened there?

46
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:57,034
What, are we friends now?

47
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:01,472
I'd say we're a little bit
more than friends.

48
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:08,614
Bon Jovi get a big record contract
or somethin'?

49
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:10,239
His name's not Bon Jovi.

50
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,408
Oh.

51
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:15,512
He plays guitar.

52
00:06:16,556 --> 00:06:18,615
Everyone plays guitar.

53
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:21,217
You play guitar?

54
00:06:21,895 --> 00:06:23,760
No.

55
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:27,594
Strike two.

56
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:30,534
Strike two?

57
00:06:30,603 --> 00:06:32,662
What was strike one?

58
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:54,786
Would you like to sit
next to your girlfriend?

59
00:06:55,795 --> 00:06:58,696
Thank you very much.
I'd love to.

60
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:24,484
So, what's your deal, Oliver?
You in New York on business?

61
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:29,654
Me? Oh, uh...
Well, thank you for asking.

62
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:32,493
No, actually I'm here
visiting my brother.

63
00:07:32,565 --> 00:07:36,194
He's a lawyer. Well, he's going to be.
He's in law school, so...

64
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:42,736
Is that what you wanna do, too?

65
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:45,277
I don't know.

66
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:47,438
I just finished school.

67
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:50,244
Don't people usually graduate in June?

68
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,282
Yeah.

69
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:54,548
It's almost a year ago.
You still don't have a job?

70
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:56,555
What are you, my mom?

71
00:07:56,623 --> 00:08:00,684
I don't know, when you look at me,
do you see your mom?

72
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:18,775
- What sign are you?
- What sign am I?

73
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:24,142
Cancer.

74
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,582
Strike three.

75
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:31,752
Thanks.

76
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:33,588
It's Emily.

77
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:37,419
I'd have never guessed Emily.

78
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:40,727
Don't get mugged.

79
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:28,469
Nice to meet you too, Oliver.
I'm Carol. I've heard a lot about you.

80
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:31,312
I'm sorry, I thought you were...

81
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:35,614
Yeah.

82
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:35,446
Thank you very much.

83
00:10:51,898 --> 00:10:53,559
- Where'd it go?
- What?

84
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,294
My jacket.
It was right there.

85
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:57,836
What jacket?

86
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:04,840
I ain't seen no jacket.

87
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:07,503
What?

88
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,912
What can I get for 20?

89
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:11,278
20?

90
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:12,908
Dollars?

91
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:05,394
You know, kissing a smoker
is like licking an ashtray.

92
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:08,530
Really?
What's screwing one like?

93
00:12:10,643 --> 00:12:13,339
- You stalking me?
- Yes.

94
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:20,285
Oh, somebody stole my jacket.

95
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:23,413
What are you doing?
You wanna do something?

96
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:25,718
What, are we friends now?

97
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:27,453
Ah! Here she is.

98
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:30,985
- I thought you were using the ladies'.
- I was. But, um...

99
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:32,964
I just came out to get some air.

100
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:35,466
Hi, I'm Brent, Emily's father.

101
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:37,025
Hi, Oliver.

102
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:38,661
- Christine.
- My stepmother.

103
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:40,638
So, you ready for some Guggenheim?

104
00:12:40,706 --> 00:12:44,005
You know what? Can I... Would you mind
if I skipped the museum?

105
00:12:44,077 --> 00:12:48,707
- Oh, Em, Christine took off work.
- I know. I'm sorry, it's just...

106
00:12:50,349 --> 00:12:52,544
Would you mind if I tell them?

107
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:57,213
No, not at all.
Go ahead.

108
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:01,018
Oliver is getting
some test results back today,

109
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:05,030
and he was just wondering
if I could go with him.

110
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:07,623
It's a scary time.
It's OK.

111
00:13:09,702 --> 00:13:12,671
- So... It won't take long.
- Oh, don't you worry about that.

112
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:14,603
You take as long as you need.

113
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:18,369
I'm sure everything will turn out fine.

114
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:20,571
You'll see.

115
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:24,314
Good luck.

116
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:25,907
- I'll see ya later?
- OK.

117
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:27,849
Thanks.

118
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,554
You know,
stuff like that's not even funny.

119
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:36,117
You only get one chance
to make a first impression.

120
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:39,392
What do you care what my dad thinks?

121
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:43,231
What if we hit it off,
become a thing or something?

122
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:48,139
- What was that?
- You and I would never become a thing.

123
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:51,574
Oh! OK, you really think pretty
highly of yourself, don't you?

124
00:13:51,644 --> 00:13:54,442
First of all, why would I get mixed up
with a guy who I know firsthand

125
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:59,781
will jump into an airplane bathroom
with the first girl that comes a-knockin'?

126
00:13:59,886 --> 00:14:02,650
That was with you!

127
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:05,316
You don't wanna get mixed up with me
because I slept with you?

128
00:14:05,391 --> 00:14:09,885
Second of all, you're not even
close to being my type.

129
00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:12,726
Well, I'm not lookin' for
a girlfriend anyway, so...

130
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:16,734
And thirdly, it turns out
you might be gay.

131
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:19,270
I mean, I want a girlfriend.

132
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:24,142
Whatever.
Just first things first, you know?

133
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:27,008
- What things?
- I don't know.

134
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:32,141
Make a plan
and get all my ducks in line.

135
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:34,685
You mean ducks in a row?

136
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:38,588
- Yes, I mean ducks in a row.
- Well, what ducks are those?

137
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:45,188
Like the normal kinda ducks.
Like, job, career, house, future.

138
00:14:45,264 --> 00:14:49,667
And what? Then the girl of your dreams
will just come and find you?

139
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:51,293
Yep.

140
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:55,231
I'll find her.
We'll find each other.

141
00:14:57,176 --> 00:15:02,011
Don't worry about me and girls, OK?
I do all right.

142
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:04,072
Here.

143
00:15:10,022 --> 00:15:12,582
What's that?
Stop. Get outta here.

144
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:14,683
You're not unattractive.

145
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:23,731
You do realize it's the middle
of the afternoon, right?

146
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:25,794
Mm-hm.

147
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:37,275
Two more?

148
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:39,374
You know what?
I still got stuff to do today, so...

149
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:41,453
So do I.

150
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:45,779
You know what?
Make 'em doubles.

151
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:47,984
They are doubles.

152
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:00,170
26.

153
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,332
You know what?
I got it.

154
00:16:02,408 --> 00:16:05,309
- I know.
- You know.

155
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:09,237
You know what?
I don't mind paying,

156
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:12,317
but I hate the fact that
you assume that I'm paying.

157
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:14,852
That's just...
I mean, at least make a move.

158
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,980
Like, make the reach for it
or something.

159
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,931
What if you don't get
your ducks in a row?

160
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:32,596
I'll get my ducks in a row.
In a line.

161
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,338
What if it takes 20 years?

162
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:41,346
It's not gonna take 20 years.
It's gonna take five years.

163
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:44,872
Six, maybe. Max.

164
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:47,179
You don't even have a job.

165
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:50,585
- You don't even have an inkling of a job.
- See, that's not true.

166
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:54,387
I'm kinda interested in all the stuff
going on with the Internet.

167
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,894
Well, that's good.
I hear that's gonna be huge.

168
00:16:58,164 --> 00:17:00,359
- It will be.
- I'm sure.

169
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:05,837
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No!

170
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:09,341
I think you're gonna be beating away
chicks with a stick.

171
00:17:10,242 --> 00:17:12,506
Do you really think that
six years from now,

172
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:19,006
a guy like me, with a job, a house,
a car - a nice car - and a future,

173
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:22,110
you think I'm gonna have a problem
findin' somebody to fall in love with me?

174
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:24,485
Oh, I think you're gonna have
a big problem.

175
00:17:24,557 --> 00:17:26,787
You...

176
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:30,891
What are you doing?

177
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:35,457
All right. I am writing down
my parents' phone number.

178
00:17:35,534 --> 00:17:37,661
- You live with your parents?
- No.

179
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:39,602
Yes.
But not in six years, I won't.

180
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:41,196
What does six years have anything
to do with it?

181
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:45,004
Yeah, well, if you let me finish,
it's my whole... it's my whole point.

182
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:48,672
Six years from now,
you call this phone number,

183
00:17:48,748 --> 00:17:51,740
my parents will answer the phone.
You ask 'em how to reach me.

184
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:53,682
They'll give you the number.

185
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:58,019
Then you call my house, and when
my beautiful wife answers the phone,

186
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,558
then you can ask her
where to send the 20 bucks you owe me.

187
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:04,528
20 bucks? I thought you were gonna
be some hotshot business guy.

188
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:08,858
Fine. 50.

189
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:11,334
- 50 big ones.
- 50 it is.

190
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:17,406
Whoa.

191
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,520
Any time before Christmas.

192
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:38,286
- I'm saving my film.
- For what?

193
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:44,368
For your trip? This is your trip.
It's happening right now.

194
00:18:44,437 --> 00:18:48,737
Don't. Be careful. I got it
for Christmas, so don't...

195
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:53,475
Oh, no.
You're not shooting me.

196
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,076
Oh. All the places I've traveled.

197
00:18:57,183 --> 00:18:59,117
Nice.
Mom's gonna love that one.

198
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:04,088
Look alive. Look, act really
natural in your surrounding.

199
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:10,820
Look sexy.
Let's see Ollie being sexy.

200
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:14,231
Ooh, I like it.

201
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:17,060
There you go.
That's good.

202
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:18,660
Yeah!

203
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:22,571
Make love to the tree.
Yeah!

204
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:23,972
Now give it to me.

205
00:19:24,043 --> 00:19:26,068
- Give me the camera.
- "Please."

206
00:19:26,145 --> 00:19:28,340
Would you give me the camera?

207
00:19:28,414 --> 00:19:31,941
- Are you done?
- You're out of film.

208
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:33,678
No.

209
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:39,090
- How did you shoot a whole roll?
- You're very shootable.

210
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:41,149
Did I not just say I'm saving the film?

211
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:47,990
Hey.

212
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:50,561
- Did you get the right film?
- I don't know.

213
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:53,330
- 400 speed?
- I don't know, I just got film.

214
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:57,171
- Was there change?
- Shut up. Give me that.

215
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:16,291
I gotta go.

216
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:19,058
OK.

217
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:32,269
- So...
- Don't.

218
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:34,710
You'll ruin it.

219
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:18,050
That was, uh...

220
00:21:18,123 --> 00:21:20,557
That was pretty good.

221
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:23,720
Pretty good?

222
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:26,697
All right, awesome.

223
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:30,360
- Mm-hm.
- Mind-blowing.

224
00:21:30,436 --> 00:21:32,700
Out of this world.
Is that working for ya?

225
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:35,171
- Yeah.
- Yeah? All right.

226
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,870
- Where are you going?
- I gotta work. I'm sorry.

227
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:47,810
Oh, my God, are you serious?
I thought I was terrible.

228
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,855
OK, wait, let me just get a pen.
Hold on.

229
00:21:52,658 --> 00:21:54,785
Honey.

230
00:21:58,163 --> 00:22:00,324
OK, go ahead.

231
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:04,097
Uh-huh.
Is that the Valley?

232
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:07,730
OK.
No, am I gonna be late?

233
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:10,400
OK, OK. I will.

234
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:12,706
I will.
OK, thank you.

235
00:22:12,778 --> 00:22:14,712
OK. Bye.

236
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,839
I got it.
I got it!

237
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:18,712
You... what?
You got the part?

238
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:22,184
No, I got a callback.
But still!

239
00:22:22,254 --> 00:22:25,746
It's one of those low-budget
independent films, but who cares?

240
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:31,993
Sweetie, will you just run
my lines with me before I go?

241
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:43,433
OK, what do you think?

242
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:47,843
I don't wanna look too desperate,
even though I am.

243
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:49,972
What are you doing?

244
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:52,841
I'm going.

245
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:55,186
Honey, you don't have to go,
I'm going.

246
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:57,619
- You can have two whole hours here.
- No, Em.

247
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,117
I mean...

248
00:23:02,094 --> 00:23:04,119
I'm going.

249
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:06,187
I'm sorry.

250
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:18,536
- Martin, please, listen to me.
- Let go, Alexa.

251
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,170
It can't end this way, Martin,
not like this.

252
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:24,079
You should've thought of that
before, Alexa.

253
00:23:24,183 --> 00:23:27,152
Don't turn your back on me, Martin.
You owe me more than that.

254
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:32,316
I don't have anymore to give, Alexa.
You've taken it all.

255
00:23:32,391 --> 00:23:35,519
- I'm sorry, just... Look at me, Martin...
- OK, thank you.

256
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:38,028
Sorry, I just lost my place.
Sorry.

257
00:23:38,097 --> 00:23:40,759
Emily, Emily, it's...
It's very, very good.

258
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:44,394
Just try and keep in mind
how much you love him.

259
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,334
- Martin?
- Yeah.

260
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:46,894
- OK.
- He's the love of her life, OK?

261
00:23:46,972 --> 00:23:50,908
So how would that make her feel
if he was leaving her?

262
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:55,313
- Desperately unhappy?
- Exactly.

263
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,716
Just one more thing.
Try and keep in mind she's a vampire.

264
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:03,653
OK, here we go.
And action.

265
00:24:07,426 --> 00:24:09,792
You're better off.
That's what I think.

266
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:11,295
Of course she's better off.

267
00:24:11,363 --> 00:24:13,831
Dumps you right before New Year's.
It's awful.

268
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:15,958
I didn't want to say anything to you
while you were still seeing him...

269
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:18,901
- Here, Dallas.
...but it's always gotta be about him.

270
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:23,340
Well, I didn't see Peter that way at all.
He could be too nice.

271
00:24:23,408 --> 00:24:26,138
Yeah, I guess you're right.
But she's still better off.

272
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:28,111
- Oh, she is much better off.
- She's better off.

273
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,045
When it's over, it's over.

274
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:33,307
- You're coming tomorrow, aren't you, Em?
- She's coming.

275
00:24:33,418 --> 00:24:36,080
Hey, how about a blind date?
I know someone.

276
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:39,157
- You can't take a blind date to New Year's.
- Why?

277
00:24:39,224 --> 00:24:42,022
Why? Because it's a blind date.
You don't roll the dice on New Year's.

278
00:24:42,094 --> 00:24:43,618
Well, you don't go to
New Year's alone either.

279
00:24:43,695 --> 00:24:45,629
- Why not? I'm going alone.
- Well, that's you.

280
00:24:45,697 --> 00:24:48,131
- And what's that supposed to mean?
- I'm just sayin'.

281
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,160
The point is, is that it's New Year's.
And you know, date or no date,

282
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:56,036
you just don't spend New Year's alone.

283
00:24:56,775 --> 00:24:59,471
Don't.
She quit.

284
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:21,024
Hi, is David there?

285
00:25:22,267 --> 00:25:24,201
Hi, is Chris there?

286
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:27,170
Hi, I was looking for Frank.

287
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:36,470
Yeah. No, most people... most normal
people have plans, you know,

288
00:25:36,582 --> 00:25:38,709
being that it's New Year's and all,
but thanks anyway.

289
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:45,018
Do you happen to know if he...
if he'll be back later or?

290
00:25:45,824 --> 00:25:47,291
Oh.

291
00:25:49,828 --> 00:25:52,388
What's your name?

292
00:26:34,506 --> 00:26:36,701
Hello, Martin residence.

293
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,173
Hello?

294
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:41,812
Hello?

295
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,610
Hey... He-hello?
Hi.

296
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:46,479
Is Oliver there?

297
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:49,053
Yes, just a second.
Oliver!

298
00:26:49,121 --> 00:26:52,420
- Yeah?!
- Telephone!

299
00:26:55,227 --> 00:26:56,888
<i>Hello?</i>

300
00:26:56,962 --> 00:26:59,954
- Hello? Oliver?
- This is.

301
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,367
This is Emily.
I don't know if you remember me.

302
00:27:06,438 --> 00:27:09,771
- Emily, New York Emily?
- Yeah.

303
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:11,638
<i>- Hello?</i>
- I got it, Ellen.

304
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,177
<i>- Hello?</i>
- I got it, Ellen.

305
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:16,373
<i>OK. God. I didn't know.</i>
<i>Sorry.</i>

306
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:20,110
What a goofball, huh?
You still there?

307
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:21,685
Yeah, yeah. I'm here.

308
00:27:22,854 --> 00:27:24,481
So what's up?

309
00:27:24,556 --> 00:27:27,047
No, I was just...
I was just wondering...

310
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:29,855
I just came across
your number all of a sudden

311
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:32,897
and I was just thinking to myself...

312
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:35,263
You know, "Wow, I wonder what
Oliver's doing."

313
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:38,264
You know, I know that you're
probably busy tonight,

314
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:42,330
but I was just wondering if you
wanted to grab a coffee this afternoon.

315
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:46,410
- Sure.
- So, really?

316
00:27:46,478 --> 00:27:48,309
<i>- Oliver.</i>
- I'm on the phone, Ellen.

317
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,644
I know. When you gettin' off?
I'm expecting a call.

318
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:51,716
You got a pager, Ellen.

319
00:27:51,817 --> 00:27:54,377
<i>- I know. But I can't talk on a pager.</i>
- Ellen, get off the phone!

320
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:56,818
You are such a dick!

321
00:27:56,888 --> 00:28:00,016
Get off the phone, Ellen!
Mom, tell Ellen to get off the phone.

322
00:28:00,092 --> 00:28:02,720
- Ellen!
- Hello?

323
00:28:02,794 --> 00:28:05,888
Sorry about that.
You still there?

324
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:07,261
Yeah.

325
00:28:09,368 --> 00:28:11,996
Uh, where are you?
I'll come over.

326
00:28:12,771 --> 00:28:14,671
- Now?
- Yes.

327
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,334
Why don't I...
Why don't I come over?

328
00:28:31,556 --> 00:28:33,421
- Hello?
<i>- Hello. It's me.</i>

329
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:38,657
Hey. The gate's broken,
so just give it a jiggle and then just push.

330
00:28:46,638 --> 00:28:48,902
- Hi.
- Hi.

331
00:28:53,745 --> 00:28:56,646
- I'm Emily.
- I'm Oliver.

332
00:28:56,748 --> 00:28:59,308
You're not Oliver.

333
00:28:59,418 --> 00:29:00,385
Ahh!

334
00:29:02,154 --> 00:29:05,749
That's it? I thought you'd
at least invite him in.

335
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:07,587
You owe me ten dollars.

336
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:09,820
I knew he wasn't you.
You're not that good-looking.

337
00:29:15,367 --> 00:29:16,959
- She didn't say that.
- Wait, what did he say?

338
00:29:17,035 --> 00:29:19,367
What did he tell you I said?
I said you were good-looking.

339
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:21,269
- Told you.
- That's what I said.

340
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:23,000
You...

341
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,540
- He's a little...
- He's saying you're crazy.

342
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,550
Yeah, I got that.

343
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:39,015
Did she honk?

344
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:41,321
Why?

345
00:29:41,393 --> 00:29:43,918
My wife. I'm going.

346
00:29:43,995 --> 00:29:46,657
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

347
00:29:53,939 --> 00:29:55,907
- Hi.
- Hi.

348
00:29:58,076 --> 00:30:00,010
- You look different.
- So do you.

349
00:30:00,078 --> 00:30:03,047
- But, like, good different.
- You, too. I like your hair.

350
00:30:03,115 --> 00:30:04,742
Thank you.

351
00:30:05,484 --> 00:30:08,044
I'm still signing.

352
00:30:08,153 --> 00:30:11,816
Why? I don't know.
I'm stopping. OK.

353
00:30:13,358 --> 00:30:15,826
Your brother screen all your dates?

354
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:19,491
This is a date?

355
00:30:39,084 --> 00:30:41,644
Can I get you anything to drink?
A tea or a soda?

356
00:30:41,753 --> 00:30:45,189
- I'm good, thanks.
- Just gonna grab a beer.

357
00:30:52,797 --> 00:30:56,995
I can't believe you just assumed
that this was what this was about.

358
00:31:00,472 --> 00:31:05,239
You can't... You can't believe I assumed
that what was about the what?

359
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,778
Because I'm not the same girl
you met three years ago.

360
00:31:07,846 --> 00:31:12,647
I mean, I'm the same girl,
but it's not at all the same situation.

361
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:14,241
Right.
I understand.

362
00:31:14,352 --> 00:31:16,411
I'm not one of those girls
who needs to sleep with someone

363
00:31:16,521 --> 00:31:20,514
after every stupid breakup
just to prove she's still got it. I...

364
00:31:20,592 --> 00:31:22,856
Yeah.

365
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:24,919
What are you doing?

366
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:29,526
I am looking for your crazy pills.

367
00:31:30,202 --> 00:31:33,535
You know, they have to be around here
somewhere for moments like these, right?

368
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:36,834
That's not funny.

369
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:39,240
What if I really was crazy?

370
00:31:40,412 --> 00:31:42,437
Have you eaten today?

371
00:31:44,115 --> 00:31:47,107
How can you live in LA
and not have a car?

372
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:52,213
I had a car, then I sold it.
I needed the capital for my business.

373
00:31:52,324 --> 00:31:55,122
That's right.
The plan. The ducks.

374
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,884
It's all coming back to me now.

375
00:31:56,962 --> 00:32:00,625
Only two and a half more years
until you're rich.

376
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:01,631
That's right.

377
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,464
Is your beautiful wife gonna live in your
parents' basement with you?

378
00:32:04,536 --> 00:32:08,131
- I don't live with my parents.
- Just visiting?

379
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:12,006
No, I was just pickin'
some stuff up 'cause I'm moving.

380
00:32:12,077 --> 00:32:14,011
"Diaper-rush-dot-com"?

381
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,913
That's what it says.
We sell diapers on the Internet.

382
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:20,450
I thought the whole
Internet thing was done already.

383
00:32:20,518 --> 00:32:24,284
- Just need a good business plan.
- Diapers?

384
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:29,349
So, how's Bon Jovi?
Does he still rock?

385
00:32:29,427 --> 00:32:31,588
Who?

386
00:32:31,663 --> 00:32:35,155
Oh, him. He switched bands
and moved to Seattle.

387
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:39,192
Nice. Hope he knows how to steam milk
and make those little chocolate shavings.

388
00:32:39,271 --> 00:32:41,364
Big talk coming from a diaper salesman.

389
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:44,067
Oh, OK.

390
00:32:44,142 --> 00:32:46,042
And the latest breakup?
What's he do?

391
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:49,410
- Is he a baseball player or a cosmonaut?
- Who said I had a breakup?

392
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:53,918
You did. In your kitchen
during your hypoglycemic rant.

393
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,745
So?
Spill it. Who's the guy?

394
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,586
I'm not telling you.

395
00:33:01,593 --> 00:33:04,960
Did you dump him?
No. He dumped you.

396
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,624
- I'm not gonna talk about it.
- OK.

397
00:33:07,699 --> 00:33:10,099
Fine.
Then I'm not talkin' at all.

398
00:33:10,168 --> 00:33:12,432
- You're not talking?
- You ain't gettin' boo outta me.

399
00:33:12,504 --> 00:33:14,904
Fine, I'm not talking either.

400
00:35:11,222 --> 00:35:13,190
Are you OK?

401
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:47,849
OK, fine.
I'll tell you.

402
00:35:48,526 --> 00:35:51,654
Mmm. My brother's deaf, Em.

403
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:54,163
I can go days without talking.

404
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,567
Can we have the check, please?

405
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:05,571
- I met him in class.
- Yeah?

406
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:08,669
- You went back to school?
- Acting class.

407
00:36:08,746 --> 00:36:11,180
Ah, he's an actor.

408
00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:14,251
Wow, actors. That's like
one rung up from musicians.

409
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:15,910
He was a writer.
Is a writer.

410
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,456
Hm.
Hi. Could I get a coffee?

411
00:36:19,524 --> 00:36:21,355
- Mm-hm.
- Just very black.

412
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:22,984
- After you.
- Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

413
00:36:23,061 --> 00:36:26,360
- Frappuccino, please.
- All right.

414
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:31,328
I believe the question
was who dumped whom?

415
00:36:32,337 --> 00:36:34,430
He left me.

416
00:36:35,907 --> 00:36:39,104
- I got it.
- No, I got it.

417
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:41,907
No. But I appreciate the reach.

418
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,540
The acting classes are really
paying off, but I got it.

419
00:36:44,649 --> 00:36:46,844
Shut up, I got it.

420
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,688
So what are your plans?

421
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:57,518
- Plans for what?
- Tonight.

422
00:36:57,595 --> 00:36:59,358
It is New Year's.

423
00:37:00,298 --> 00:37:03,233
Yeah.
I'm not a really big New Year's guy.

424
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:07,761
- Bunch of amateurs getting drunk.
- Yeah. Yeah.

425
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,139
- Cringy people wearing those party hats.
- Ah! The hats.

426
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:15,341
Lame.

427
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:19,282
- I know of a party.
- Really?

428
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:20,681
Let's go.

429
00:37:26,357 --> 00:37:31,021
You got more clothes in your trunk
than I got in my whole closet.

430
00:37:31,095 --> 00:37:32,653
Try this.

431
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,494
Nice.
Is this Bon Jovi's?

432
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:39,901
Am I supposed to act like I'm some big
Hollywood-producer type or something?

433
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:42,030
Just be yourself.

434
00:37:42,273 --> 00:37:45,470
Except maybe don't mention
the whole diaper thing.

435
00:37:47,478 --> 00:37:50,106
Hey, Emily.
I gotta ask you somethin'.

436
00:37:50,181 --> 00:37:53,116
- Hey, do you mind?
- Sorry.

437
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:55,482
What?
What do you have to ask me?

438
00:37:55,553 --> 00:38:00,149
- Well, what was strike one?
- What?

439
00:38:00,224 --> 00:38:01,589
In New York.

440
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:04,321
Strike two was that
I didn't play guitar.

441
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:09,264
Strike three was that I was born
under the wrong star sign.

442
00:38:11,903 --> 00:38:13,768
What was strike one?

443
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:16,705
Strike one was that
I had to make the first move.

444
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:20,544
I got strike one before we even met?

445
00:38:20,612 --> 00:38:24,946
You can't get strike one
before you step up to the plate.

446
00:38:29,921 --> 00:38:33,322
You drive.

447
00:38:36,694 --> 00:38:39,185
- I introduced myself.
- What?

448
00:38:39,263 --> 00:38:42,790
In New York. I introduced myself.
That's not a move?

449
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:46,530
- Who called who today?
- I didn't have your number.

450
00:38:46,604 --> 00:38:49,402
You never asked.

451
00:38:49,474 --> 00:38:52,204
You came!

452
00:38:52,276 --> 00:38:54,836
And with a young man in tow.

453
00:38:54,912 --> 00:38:57,779
This is Michelle
and Michelle's fiancé, Michael.

454
00:38:57,882 --> 00:39:00,350
Hi. Oliver.

455
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:02,817
I sell diapers.

456
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:06,955
- Well, it's nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

457
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:12,354
- Hello, ladies.
- Oh, my God! Look at you.

458
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:19,166
- Get you a drink?
- I'm good, thanks.

459
00:39:19,937 --> 00:39:21,996
I think I'll get one.

460
00:39:26,444 --> 00:39:29,174
Uh-uh. You are not
getting off that easy.

461
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:30,839
He's an old friend.

462
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:33,883
I wish I had an old friend that looked
like that. He's gorgeous.

463
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:36,078
Come on, give it up.

464
00:39:42,126 --> 00:39:44,060
Uh-oh.

465
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:49,327
Very carefully, I want you to move
backwards in the direction of the bar.

466
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:01,176
Hello?

467
00:40:01,245 --> 00:40:02,735
Ellen, it's me.

468
00:40:02,814 --> 00:40:04,645
What do you want, Oliver?

469
00:40:04,749 --> 00:40:07,843
Listen, I'm at this big Hollywood party

470
00:40:07,952 --> 00:40:11,479
<i>and I just ran into that...</i>
<i>the white rapper guy you like.</i>

471
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:14,149
Eminem?
No way!

472
00:40:14,225 --> 00:40:17,490
So listen. So I'm sitting at the bar,
right? And we're talking.

473
00:40:17,562 --> 00:40:22,363
And outta nowhere he starts
running his hand up and down my leg.

474
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:26,496
Happy New Year, Ellen.

475
00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:28,664
You're such a dick, Oliver!

476
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:32,571
- Thank you.
- Eminem's here?

477
00:40:37,215 --> 00:40:39,683
Who's he talking to?
Her?

478
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:42,618
Some guy.

479
00:40:42,687 --> 00:40:45,884
- Now he's talking to her.
- She just kissed him.

480
00:40:45,957 --> 00:40:48,255
- Kissed who?
- Peter. She's kissing Peter.

481
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:50,419
Is he kissing her back?

482
00:41:06,244 --> 00:41:09,645
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
It sounded like you said you sell diapers.

483
00:41:09,714 --> 00:41:11,579
There you are!

484
00:41:11,682 --> 00:41:13,479
Come on.

485
00:41:34,772 --> 00:41:38,606
Put your hands on my ass.
That'll really get him.

486
00:41:46,217 --> 00:41:49,380
Do you want me to put my hands
on your ass?

487
00:41:54,926 --> 00:41:56,951
- You all right?
- Yeah.

488
00:41:57,028 --> 00:42:00,122
I'm gonna go...
I'm gonna go to the ladies' room.

489
00:42:00,198 --> 00:42:02,758
I'll be right back.

490
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:26,249
Come on in here, y'all!

491
00:42:26,324 --> 00:42:30,727
'Cause this is New Year's,
and y'all know how this goes.

492
00:43:07,732 --> 00:43:10,792
Here we go.
It's time for the countdown.

493
00:43:10,868 --> 00:43:12,096
10...

494
00:43:12,169 --> 00:43:17,903
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4...

495
00:43:17,975 --> 00:43:21,138
3, 2, 1!

496
00:43:21,212 --> 00:43:24,113
Happy New Year!

497
00:43:43,734 --> 00:43:47,966
- Clearly...
- Shh!

498
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:52,874
- Clearly, you're not a fan of...
- Shh!

499
00:43:52,944 --> 00:43:55,435
- You're cl...
- I'm serious.

500
00:43:55,513 --> 00:43:57,845
My neighbors are, like,
flip-out kind of people.

501
00:43:57,949 --> 00:43:59,678
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

502
00:43:59,784 --> 00:44:03,982
- OK, that's enough.
- Having a problem? Very serious.

503
00:44:04,956 --> 00:44:08,084
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

504
00:44:10,628 --> 00:44:12,926
Oliver.

505
00:44:12,997 --> 00:44:15,192
You've been robbed.

506
00:44:15,266 --> 00:44:17,996
- I'm moving.
- You are?

507
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,297
Yeah.
I told you.

508
00:44:21,372 --> 00:44:23,738
You did?

509
00:44:23,808 --> 00:44:26,276
It's official.
The power's off.

510
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:28,244
When did you tell me?

511
00:44:30,047 --> 00:44:32,379
Earlier.

512
00:44:32,483 --> 00:44:36,817
My business.
It's in San Francisco.

513
00:44:36,887 --> 00:44:39,117
When are you leaving?

514
00:44:41,092 --> 00:44:43,458
Tomorrow.

515
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:53,361
- Ollie.
- Yeah?

516
00:44:53,437 --> 00:44:56,406
Ah, nice. Thank you.

517
00:45:00,745 --> 00:45:03,236
Hey, I took this.

518
00:45:04,248 --> 00:45:06,375
Yeah, I know.

519
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:11,049
You framed it.

520
00:45:11,122 --> 00:45:15,024
- Yeah, I liked it.
- You framed my picture.

521
00:45:15,092 --> 00:45:17,253
It's a good picture.

522
00:45:18,262 --> 00:45:20,560
Wow.

523
00:45:22,233 --> 00:45:26,636
Just when I'm starting to like you,
you're moving away.

524
00:45:35,946 --> 00:45:38,380
- Can I tell you something?
- Mm-hm.

525
00:45:42,853 --> 00:45:46,914
I think that...
that it's time that...

526
00:45:50,161 --> 00:45:52,925
I think it's time that I stop...

527
00:45:55,132 --> 00:45:57,896
being somebody's...

528
00:45:57,968 --> 00:45:59,868
girlfriend.

529
00:45:59,937 --> 00:46:02,497
Hold on one second.
Just one sec.

530
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:05,170
Don't move.

531
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:14,400
Emily?

532
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:22,052
Emily?

533
00:47:35,733 --> 00:47:37,860
You OK?

534
00:47:43,774 --> 00:47:46,072
You gonna throw up?

535
00:49:25,643 --> 00:49:28,043
Hey, baby.

536
00:49:28,112 --> 00:49:29,773
I'm home.

537
00:49:29,847 --> 00:49:32,042
Sorry I'm late.
I got hung up at the office.

538
00:49:32,149 --> 00:49:34,743
On the phone with some
bean-counters from Huggies.

539
00:49:34,852 --> 00:49:37,412
- Did you remember the wine?
- The what?

540
00:49:37,521 --> 00:49:39,887
The wine.

541
00:49:41,525 --> 00:49:43,789
I forgot.
You know what?

542
00:49:43,861 --> 00:49:45,226
- I'll get it right now.
- Uh-uh.

543
00:49:45,296 --> 00:49:48,322
Don't bother, I already picked it up.

544
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:50,960
Why'd you ask me
if I got it in the first place?

545
00:49:51,035 --> 00:49:53,196
Because I knew you wouldn't
remember that I asked you.

546
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:56,000
I knew you'd forget it.

547
00:49:57,508 --> 00:50:01,342
Well, that's something of
a self-fulfilling prophecy then, huh?

548
00:50:01,412 --> 00:50:03,880
You know what, Oliver?
You're never here.

549
00:50:03,947 --> 00:50:07,474
And even when you are here,
you're still not here.

550
00:50:07,584 --> 00:50:09,916
I'm here right now.

551
00:50:09,987 --> 00:50:12,455
You seen my red shirt?

552
00:50:19,463 --> 00:50:23,399
- I can't do it anymore, Ollie.
- Can't do what?

553
00:50:24,601 --> 00:50:26,660
This.

554
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:31,164
What are you trying to say?

555
00:50:34,712 --> 00:50:39,206
I don't know, Ollie, I just...
I think we need to take a break.

556
00:51:04,241 --> 00:51:08,041
- Hi. Do you mind if I just?
- Oh, I'm sorry. I was...

557
00:51:08,112 --> 00:51:11,809
I was gonna get that.

558
00:51:11,915 --> 00:51:15,009
- Well, there's a bunch more.
- Right.

559
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:19,385
- You wanna trade?
- No, thanks, I'm gonna take this one.

560
00:51:19,456 --> 00:51:21,549
Aha. So I see you knew
it was the import.

561
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:26,028
- Very sneaky. Very sly.
- It's got the acoustic B-side.

562
00:51:26,096 --> 00:51:27,723
Yes, and a bonus track.
So you see my dilemma.

563
00:51:27,798 --> 00:51:30,665
I can't possibly allow you to walk out
of this store with the last copy.

564
00:51:30,734 --> 00:51:33,202
I'm not just gonna walk out.
I'm gonna pay for it first.

565
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:35,101
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you?

566
00:51:35,172 --> 00:51:37,572
Oh, jeez, spare me the pickup line.
Here.

567
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:39,632
No, it wasn't a pickup line.
I do know you.

568
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,177
Michelle's wedding.
Michelle Foster.

569
00:51:41,245 --> 00:51:45,204
- I went to school with her husband.
- Oh. Yeah, wait. Ben something.

570
00:51:45,315 --> 00:51:46,612
That's right.
Ben Miller. That's right.

571
00:51:46,717 --> 00:51:50,448
And you are...

572
00:51:50,521 --> 00:51:52,182
...Emily.

573
00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:56,088
- Here.
- No, I couldn't.

574
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,025
- Come on, just take it.
- Really, it's yours.

575
00:51:58,095 --> 00:52:00,495
No, just take it.
Seriously, I feel bad. Take it.

576
00:52:00,564 --> 00:52:02,964
- It's yours.
- You know you want it.

577
00:52:03,033 --> 00:52:05,900
- I do want it.
- Take it. Here.

578
00:52:05,969 --> 00:52:08,301
- Really?
- Yeah.

579
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:13,466
Can't believe you just took it.

580
00:52:31,762 --> 00:52:33,889
Airport. Yeah.

581
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,627
Dude.
Dude, this is what I want.

582
00:52:38,702 --> 00:52:40,966
Exactly like this.
All black like Batman.

583
00:52:41,038 --> 00:52:42,562
- Very cool.
- Yep.

584
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:44,607
- What are you doin'?
- Test-driving. Hop in the back, dude.

585
00:52:44,675 --> 00:52:46,939
Yo, you should get one, too,
like Batman and Robin.

586
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:49,444
Except without the tights.

587
00:52:49,513 --> 00:52:52,346
It's like...
Where you gonna park it?

588
00:52:52,449 --> 00:52:55,384
This thing?
Wherever I want.

589
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,418
We're not in the money yet.

590
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:04,018
You heard your brother, all right. I mean,
we wow 'em in New York, it's a lock.

591
00:53:04,094 --> 00:53:06,221
Come on, hop in.

592
00:53:08,065 --> 00:53:11,626
You know what? I'm gonna
stick around here and finish some stuff up.

593
00:53:11,702 --> 00:53:13,966
Would you relax, please?

594
00:53:14,171 --> 00:53:18,699
Dude, take a step back, man.
You're startin' to depress me.

595
00:53:18,775 --> 00:53:21,608
Go take a weekend off.
Do somethin' for yourself, all right?

596
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,451
Beautiful.

597
00:54:05,923 --> 00:54:08,050
- Gorgeous.
- Come on, Hailey.

598
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:10,491
Wait. Hailey!

599
00:54:10,561 --> 00:54:14,497
Hailey, hold on.
Sweetie.

600
00:54:16,366 --> 00:54:20,302
Oh, my God, are you guys kidding?
Get a room.

601
00:54:21,371 --> 00:54:23,635
Oh, I can't help it,
he's so hot.

602
00:54:23,707 --> 00:54:25,538
Hi. Emily.

603
00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:27,975
Oh, thank God you can't get pregnant
when you're pregnant.

604
00:54:28,045 --> 00:54:30,036
Hi.

605
00:54:30,113 --> 00:54:35,779
- So, you and Ben went on a little date?
- Yeah. We had lunch.

606
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,683
It was nice.

607
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:42,315
- That's all I'm gonna get outta you, isn't it?
- Yeah.

608
00:54:42,392 --> 00:54:44,792
Well, then I should probably
get back to work.

609
00:54:44,861 --> 00:54:46,556
- Bye, hon.
- Bye, sexy.

610
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:49,258
- See ya.
- Bye.

611
00:54:50,233 --> 00:54:52,963
Lunch? What's the matter?
You don't like him?

612
00:54:53,036 --> 00:54:55,834
Why do you say that? Just 'cause
we didn't jump right into the sack?

613
00:54:55,906 --> 00:54:59,034
What's jumpin' in the sack?

614
00:54:59,109 --> 00:55:02,704
It's a game people play
at picnics, honey.

615
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,724
Hey.

616
00:55:30,574 --> 00:55:35,910
I do weddings, head shots, baby showers -
you know, for the money.

617
00:55:35,979 --> 00:55:38,504
But I met a girl at a party,
she owns a gallery,

618
00:55:38,615 --> 00:55:41,550
and she said she might show
my work there, so...

619
00:55:41,618 --> 00:55:43,677
That's really cool.
How'd you do that?

620
00:55:43,787 --> 00:55:46,984
You leave the shutter open.
The hard part's staying still,

621
00:55:47,057 --> 00:55:50,754
otherwise you're just a blur
like the cars in the background.

622
00:55:52,396 --> 00:55:55,524
I'm gonna go splash
some water on my face.

623
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,432
So make yourself at home.

624
00:56:02,773 --> 00:56:06,402
Wait, he just landed on your doorstep?
Honey, that's perfect.

625
00:56:06,476 --> 00:56:09,274
Don't get excited,
he lives 400 miles away.

626
00:56:09,346 --> 00:56:11,314
<i>Emily. Let's not get picky.</i>

627
00:56:11,415 --> 00:56:13,246
And I couldn't look less sexy.

628
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:15,341
<i>Oh. Stop it. You're gorgeous.</i>

629
00:56:15,452 --> 00:56:18,216
- Has he put the moves on you yet?
- He's not the type.

630
00:56:18,288 --> 00:56:20,586
Someone's gonna have sex.

631
00:56:20,657 --> 00:56:23,490
Shh! Will you stop it!
I gotta go. Wish me luck.

632
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,892
<i>You don't need it.</i>
<i>Call me.</i>

633
00:56:29,132 --> 00:56:31,692
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

634
00:56:37,207 --> 00:56:39,437
I mean, she owned a business, right?

635
00:56:39,509 --> 00:56:43,775
Like, selling antiques. And she used to
work for the mayor's office as an advisor.

636
00:56:43,847 --> 00:56:46,782
- But she said she didn't like it. So...
- Wow, two careers already.

637
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:50,650
Yeah. So I thought that
she would understand,

638
00:56:50,721 --> 00:56:54,680
you know, the kinda work that you gotta
put in when you're first startin' out.

639
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:56,156
But...

640
00:56:58,795 --> 00:57:04,062
She said that she couldn't be
number three or number four

641
00:57:04,134 --> 00:57:06,932
on someone's list of priorities.

642
00:57:07,938 --> 00:57:11,635
She said she could be number two,
but not if number one was selling diapers.

643
00:57:14,044 --> 00:57:18,708
<i>Hi. It's</i>
<i>me calling to see how things are going.</i>

644
00:57:18,815 --> 00:57:20,715
This is... Hi. Hello?

645
00:57:20,784 --> 00:57:24,220
It's a work-related call.
I'll just be one second.

646
00:57:24,321 --> 00:57:27,484
Yes, can you get the?
Please figure out if the negatives

647
00:57:27,557 --> 00:57:31,084
are gonna be ready by tomorrow.

648
00:57:31,194 --> 00:57:33,822
- What?!
- How's it going?

649
00:57:33,897 --> 00:57:36,559
- It's not.
<i>- It'll be fine.</i>

650
00:57:36,633 --> 00:57:40,034
As long as you're not wearing
that orange sweatshirt.

651
00:57:40,103 --> 00:57:42,503
Don't call back here.

652
00:57:44,775 --> 00:57:47,869
Sorry about that, I just...

653
00:57:49,112 --> 00:57:53,845
- Where are you going?
- What's your stance on pancakes?

654
00:57:56,853 --> 00:57:59,549
I'm pro pancakes.

655
00:58:05,028 --> 00:58:06,859
Do you know
what you're gonna have yet?

656
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:09,364
I just can't...

657
00:58:12,269 --> 00:58:14,863
I can't decide what to get.

658
00:58:19,409 --> 00:58:22,572
Come on, Ollie,
you gotta just let it go.

659
00:58:22,646 --> 00:58:25,911
Smile.
You're here with me.

660
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:33,685
There it is.
That's the one.

661
00:58:33,757 --> 00:58:36,521
Hi.

662
00:58:37,661 --> 00:58:41,290
Oh, my God, Gina, hi!
How are you?

663
00:58:41,364 --> 00:58:43,924
- I'm good, how are you?
- I'm good. It's been such a long time.

664
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,331
Really long, yeah.

665
00:58:45,402 --> 00:58:47,563
- I've been meaning to call you.
- Me too.

666
00:58:47,637 --> 00:58:50,970
I was hoping that we could actually
get together and talk a bit.

667
00:58:51,508 --> 00:58:55,035
- Yeah, that would be great.
- It'd be good.

668
00:58:55,111 --> 00:58:58,308
Do you have a coupla bucks
for the waitress?

669
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:01,816
Emily. Hi.

670
00:59:01,918 --> 00:59:03,909
- Hey.
- Uh, it's...

671
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,988
- How's everything? How are you?
- I'm good.

672
00:59:06,056 --> 00:59:07,785
- Yeah? You're good?
- Yeah.

673
00:59:07,858 --> 00:59:09,348
Oh. Great.

674
00:59:09,426 --> 00:59:10,916
I was gonna sneak on by,
but then I thought,

675
00:59:10,994 --> 00:59:14,691
"I saw you,
so you probably saw me and..."

676
00:59:14,764 --> 00:59:18,564
Yeah, no, it's good that you
both said hi.

677
00:59:19,436 --> 00:59:23,395
I knew that she'd be fine with it.
I mean, it's been a long time.

678
00:59:23,473 --> 00:59:25,907
Yeah, no, I'm glad you sa...

679
00:59:28,178 --> 00:59:29,805
- Hi.
- Hey.

680
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,643
- Oliver.
- Peter.

681
00:59:31,748 --> 00:59:35,013
- Oh. Oliver.
- Hey. Good to see you again.

682
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,787
Um, you know, we should probably go
if we're gonna catch that...

683
00:59:38,855 --> 00:59:39,913
Oh. You're right.

684
00:59:40,023 --> 00:59:43,186
- Emily, take care.
- Yeah, take care. It was good to see you.

685
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:46,787
- Bye.
- Nice meeting you!

686
00:59:48,231 --> 00:59:51,200
Oh, I'm starvin'.

687
00:59:52,402 --> 00:59:55,496
- Let's get outta here.
- OK.

688
01:00:01,478 --> 01:00:05,938
All right.
Come on. Let it go.

689
01:00:06,049 --> 01:00:09,348
Smile.
You're with me.

690
01:00:09,419 --> 01:00:11,046
Shut up.

691
01:00:17,761 --> 01:00:19,956
Get off the road, grandma!

692
01:00:25,135 --> 01:00:27,365
Come on.

693
01:00:27,437 --> 01:00:31,066
Let it go.
Smile, you're with me.

694
01:00:31,141 --> 01:00:33,609
No.

695
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:39,078
Where we goin'?

696
01:00:39,182 --> 01:00:41,946
We're headin' north.

697
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:48,623
I've been killin' myself at work.
Nights, weekends.

698
01:00:48,692 --> 01:00:51,991
Even at home.
Well, Bridget's home.

699
01:00:52,062 --> 01:00:53,962
See, I moved in with her.

700
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:56,658
That was my big mistake right there.

701
01:00:56,733 --> 01:01:00,191
I shoulda stuck with the plan.
I mean, the plan was working.

702
01:01:00,303 --> 01:01:04,569
You know, the irony of it
is that Bridget actually loves plans.

703
01:01:04,641 --> 01:01:07,075
We used to go on these trips.

704
01:01:07,143 --> 01:01:11,512
She would plan everything
down to, like, the very last detail.

705
01:01:11,614 --> 01:01:15,778
I mean, like, including the gas station
that we were gonna stop at.

706
01:01:15,885 --> 01:01:19,446
I remember this one time...

707
01:01:19,556 --> 01:01:20,989
...we were in Ashland, right?

708
01:01:25,395 --> 01:01:29,092
We were at this B&B station, right?

709
01:01:29,165 --> 01:01:31,497
And it starts raining, right?

710
01:01:31,568 --> 01:01:35,129
And I'm not talkin' about regular rain.

711
01:01:35,205 --> 01:01:37,969
It was like torrential-downpour rain.

712
01:01:42,879 --> 01:01:46,474
So Bridget comes up
with this great idea, right?

713
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:50,485
Park the car in the car wash.

714
01:01:50,553 --> 01:01:53,989
Because who's gonna wash
their car when it's raining?

715
01:02:11,775 --> 01:02:13,003
Come on.

716
01:02:40,537 --> 01:02:42,903
Do you want something?

717
01:02:42,972 --> 01:02:45,702
Just... just pick something.

718
01:03:01,624 --> 01:03:03,854
Did you buy the whole store?

719
01:03:19,642 --> 01:03:21,667
Want some pie?

720
01:03:22,812 --> 01:03:24,803
You want some Cheetos?

721
01:03:33,223 --> 01:03:35,691
Oh, look at the moon.

722
01:03:41,965 --> 01:03:44,160
Let's pull over.

723
01:03:55,078 --> 01:03:57,740
- Did you love him?
- Peter?

724
01:03:57,814 --> 01:03:59,805
No.

725
01:03:59,883 --> 01:04:02,511
Maybe a little.

726
01:04:02,619 --> 01:04:04,917
Do you love Bridget?

727
01:04:05,989 --> 01:04:09,789
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Well, do you or don't you?

728
01:04:11,461 --> 01:04:13,656
I thought I did.

729
01:04:14,597 --> 01:04:17,623
Well, if it wasn't love,
it was a lot like it.

730
01:04:18,535 --> 01:04:23,768
OK, now I don't know.
Sounds stupid when I say it out loud.

731
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:29,278
Honestly, if you're not willing to sound
stupid, you don't deserve to be in love.

732
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:33,306
- Take this.
- What?

733
01:04:36,085 --> 01:04:38,576
What was that?

734
01:04:38,688 --> 01:04:41,589
- What?
- That.

735
01:04:41,658 --> 01:04:44,183
I didn't hear anything.

736
01:04:45,295 --> 01:04:47,627
Oh, my God!

737
01:04:47,697 --> 01:04:48,459
Oh!

738
01:04:48,531 --> 01:04:51,091
Oh, my God.
Are you OK? Ollie, are you all right?

739
01:04:53,002 --> 01:04:56,836
OK, I'm freezing...

740
01:05:04,314 --> 01:05:06,578
- Whoa, you just looked.
- No, I didn't.

741
01:05:06,683 --> 01:05:10,084
- You said you weren't gonna look.
- I didn't look. Go.

742
01:05:10,186 --> 01:05:12,177
I looked.

743
01:05:16,793 --> 01:05:19,523
- Ooh, looking good.
- Shut up.

744
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:22,122
Ooh, very nice.

745
01:05:22,198 --> 01:05:25,224
You're just taking advantage
of me right now. Come on.

746
01:05:25,902 --> 01:05:28,336
OK, the shutter's gonna stay open
for 40 seconds.

747
01:05:28,404 --> 01:05:31,635
- You have to keep very still, OK?
- OK.

748
01:05:34,277 --> 01:05:36,871
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

749
01:05:36,946 --> 01:05:40,939
Ooh! Ow! Ow!
Ooh, it's cold.

750
01:05:54,964 --> 01:05:57,728
- Hi.
- No moving.

751
01:06:07,076 --> 01:06:10,136
- You're moving.
- I can't help it.

752
01:07:10,773 --> 01:07:13,571
Folks, can I talk to you
out here for a second?

753
01:07:20,016 --> 01:07:21,881
Folks.

754
01:07:42,338 --> 01:07:44,829
Folks, this is a national park.

755
01:07:46,309 --> 01:07:49,301
Why don't you get back in your clothes,
back in your car

756
01:07:49,379 --> 01:07:52,507
and back on the highway.

757
01:07:52,615 --> 01:07:54,913
Have a nice day.

758
01:08:04,327 --> 01:08:06,454
I gotta go.

759
01:08:06,529 --> 01:08:07,621
OK.

760
01:08:19,709 --> 01:08:25,045
So anyway,
we got this big VC meeting in New York.

761
01:08:25,948 --> 01:08:28,610
Gotta put on this big
dog and pony show.

762
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:32,984
- You know what VC is, right?
- No.

763
01:08:33,055 --> 01:08:38,925
It's venture capital.
It's like a big influx of cash,

764
01:08:38,995 --> 01:08:41,862
to really help us grow our business.

765
01:08:41,931 --> 01:08:44,491
It sounds exciting.

766
01:09:04,821 --> 01:09:07,517
- I'll grab this.
- I got it, I got it.

767
01:09:15,465 --> 01:09:16,864
Well...

768
01:09:19,735 --> 01:09:22,602
You got my number.

769
01:09:22,672 --> 01:09:24,902
And you've got mine.

770
01:09:24,974 --> 01:09:27,033
Yes, I do.

771
01:09:29,745 --> 01:09:32,805
So I'll let you know how things go...
in New York.

772
01:09:32,915 --> 01:09:35,281
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Good.

773
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:42,487
I've still got some...

774
01:09:43,893 --> 01:09:46,293
some, like, feelings to sort through.

775
01:09:46,362 --> 01:09:49,763
- About...
- Bridget?

776
01:09:49,832 --> 01:09:51,390
Yeah.

777
01:09:51,467 --> 01:09:54,402
I didn't forget.
It's "Bridget."

778
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:57,496
- I... It's...
- It's OK.

779
01:09:59,175 --> 01:10:01,735
- Is it?
- Yeah.

780
01:10:03,246 --> 01:10:05,737
I met someone.

781
01:10:06,916 --> 01:10:08,315
You met someone?

782
01:10:08,384 --> 01:10:12,047
Yeah, I mean, it's not like we're
getting married or anything, but...

783
01:10:12,154 --> 01:10:14,486
Wait, I'm... I'm confused.

784
01:10:14,924 --> 01:10:17,916
This... this is someone different?
Not the writer guy?

785
01:10:17,994 --> 01:10:20,929
Yeah, no, a different guy.
A new guy.

786
01:10:20,997 --> 01:10:23,022
A different guy?

787
01:10:23,733 --> 01:10:25,724
What?

788
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:31,733
I don't...
You know, it's...

789
01:10:35,678 --> 01:10:37,475
Thank you.

790
01:10:40,983 --> 01:10:42,644
So...

791
01:10:54,997 --> 01:10:57,363
Don't.

792
01:10:57,433 --> 01:10:59,458
You'll ruin it.

793
01:11:12,114 --> 01:11:14,582
Get outta here, I'm sick of you.

794
01:11:29,565 --> 01:11:31,624
Pitch and go.
Pitch and go, keep up the pace.

795
01:11:31,701 --> 01:11:33,464
It's not a big deal.
I'm sorry.

796
01:11:33,536 --> 01:11:37,097
It actually is quite a big deal.
But don't go too fast.

797
01:11:37,173 --> 01:11:39,141
Ollie, you get really jittery
when you go too fast.

798
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:41,870
And I need to make sure that you don't
speed through the whole thing

799
01:11:41,944 --> 01:11:44,344
in such a way that nobody understands
exactly what you're saying.

800
01:11:44,413 --> 01:11:46,040
Because we invested a lot of time,
and everything that we're that we're do...

801
01:11:46,115 --> 01:11:48,606
Jeet-o, I need you to shut up.
All right?

802
01:11:48,718 --> 01:11:52,916
- This is exactly what I'm talkin' about.
- You're driving me crazy.

803
01:11:53,956 --> 01:11:55,423
So...

804
01:11:55,524 --> 01:11:59,392
...the baby...

805
01:11:59,462 --> 01:12:00,588
The...

806
01:12:03,165 --> 01:12:04,325
Client.

807
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:08,336
The client inputs the child's data

808
01:12:08,404 --> 01:12:11,271
and the baby actually tracks its growth.

809
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:15,743
So when it's time
to move up to a bigger size...

810
01:12:18,214 --> 01:12:21,513
There it is.
Bam. Just on your doorstep.

811
01:12:21,617 --> 01:12:23,551
No hassle, no fuss.

812
01:12:26,355 --> 01:12:28,755
Does the baby have a name?

813
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:34,886
Does the baby have a name?
Yes.

814
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:39,426
What were we saying
for the baby's name?

815
01:12:39,502 --> 01:12:40,560
Freddy.

816
01:12:40,636 --> 01:12:42,536
Freddy.

817
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:47,570
- Doesn't have to be Fred.
- Gabe...

818
01:12:47,643 --> 01:12:49,770
was another choice that we came up with.

819
01:12:51,147 --> 01:12:53,741
Gabe the babe.

820
01:12:54,684 --> 01:13:01,021
My point is, is that there are
10,000 babies born every hour.

821
01:13:01,123 --> 01:13:05,287
That's 254,000 babies a day.

822
01:13:05,361 --> 01:13:09,889
And somebody's gotta figure out
where to put all that shit.

823
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:12,834
I wanna be that guy.

824
01:13:15,604 --> 01:13:21,600
10,000 babies an hour.
Wouldn't that be 240,000 babies a day?

825
01:13:29,085 --> 01:13:30,677
Yes.

826
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,460
It was good, Ollie.
You were great.

827
01:13:39,528 --> 01:13:42,691
I mean, there was that one little thing,
but I don't think it was a big deal.

828
01:13:42,765 --> 01:13:43,732
How about you?
You think it was good?

829
01:13:43,799 --> 01:13:46,427
Great.

830
01:13:46,502 --> 01:13:48,993
It's mine.

831
01:13:49,071 --> 01:13:50,834
- Hey, I'm Jeeter. How ya doin'?
- Hi.

832
01:13:50,906 --> 01:13:53,374
- Hello?
<i>- Ollie?</i>

833
01:13:54,243 --> 01:13:57,337
- Hi.
<i>- Are you still in New York?</i>

834
01:13:57,413 --> 01:14:00,405
Yep. Can you hold on one second?
It's bad reception right here.

835
01:14:11,761 --> 01:14:13,752
Found it.

836
01:14:17,299 --> 01:14:19,597
How does it look?

837
01:14:21,337 --> 01:14:22,497
Looks good.

838
01:14:26,609 --> 01:14:30,568
- She was young, huh?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

839
01:14:32,481 --> 01:14:34,972
What kind of flowers did you get?

840
01:14:37,787 --> 01:14:39,345
Blue.

841
01:14:40,489 --> 01:14:43,151
That's perfect.

842
01:14:50,065 --> 01:14:52,329
Today's her birthday.

843
01:14:57,072 --> 01:14:58,471
Talk to me.

844
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:02,241
I don't know what to say.

845
01:15:02,311 --> 01:15:04,302
Doesn't matter.

846
01:15:09,084 --> 01:15:11,018
All right.

847
01:15:13,222 --> 01:15:15,349
There's...

848
01:15:16,425 --> 01:15:18,620
There's this kid, OK?

849
01:15:18,694 --> 01:15:22,721
<i>And he's in his backyard</i>
<i>and he's digging a hole.</i>

850
01:15:22,798 --> 01:15:30,227
And the neighbor lady
looks over the fence and says,

851
01:15:30,306 --> 01:15:32,467
"What you doing over
there, little Johnny?"

852
01:15:32,541 --> 01:15:35,533
And the kid looks really sad

853
01:15:35,611 --> 01:15:38,136
and he says, "Well, my goldfish died.

854
01:15:38,214 --> 01:15:41,672
<i>"And so I'm having a funeral for it."</i>

855
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:45,743
And the lady says,

856
01:15:45,855 --> 01:15:48,983
"Well, that's an awfully big hole
for a goldfish."

857
01:15:49,058 --> 01:15:51,492
<i>And little Johnny says</i>.

858
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:55,189
"Well, that's because he's
inside your stupid cat."

859
01:16:01,971 --> 01:16:03,802
You know, that's terrible.

860
01:16:10,012 --> 01:16:12,606
Thank you.

861
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:28,188
<i>Final call for Flight 701</i>
<i>to Los Angeles.</i>

862
01:16:28,264 --> 01:16:30,892
<i>This flight is now closing.</i>

863
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,240
Excuse me, are you traveling with us
to Los Angeles, sir?

864
01:17:02,598 --> 01:17:07,297
She lives in Los Angeles
and my work is in San Francisco.

865
01:17:07,369 --> 01:17:09,701
So, that's...

866
01:17:10,773 --> 01:17:16,405
And look, if this VC money comes in,
we're gonna be swamped anyway, so...

867
01:17:19,682 --> 01:17:23,413
But it's like, that's just...
How can I be there for her

868
01:17:23,519 --> 01:17:27,580
if I don't even have
my thing figured out? You know?

869
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:29,658
I can't.

870
01:17:31,126 --> 01:17:33,617
And I was clear with her
right from the top that...

871
01:17:33,696 --> 01:17:38,827
Like, the first day that we met
I told her that I had to have my things,

872
01:17:40,169 --> 01:17:42,967
my work and stuff that...

873
01:17:51,013 --> 01:17:55,347
So you won't be traveling with us
to Los Angeles then?

874
01:18:00,089 --> 01:18:01,579
No.

875
01:18:02,424 --> 01:18:04,119
OK.

876
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:23,878
- Hi.
- Hi.

877
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:29,342
- Hi.
- Hi.

878
01:18:29,451 --> 01:18:30,884
- I'm Jeeter.
- I'm Natalie.

879
01:18:30,953 --> 01:18:32,978
- Nice to meet you, Natalie.
- Good to meet you, too.

880
01:18:33,088 --> 01:18:36,023
You know, in about 24 hours
I'm gonna be rich.

881
01:18:36,258 --> 01:18:37,953
- Really?
- Yeah. You from New York?

882
01:18:38,027 --> 01:18:42,521
- No, I'm from LA.
- OK. Did I mention I was gonna be rich?

883
01:18:42,598 --> 01:18:43,724
- You did, actually.
- Yeah?

884
01:18:43,799 --> 01:18:44,629
- Yeah.
- You like that?

885
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,327
It's...
It's interesting.

886
01:18:46,402 --> 01:18:49,838
Natalie, what would you do with
6.2 million dollars, hypothetically?

887
01:18:58,947 --> 01:19:01,040
- Should we check it?
- Check it.

888
01:19:02,084 --> 01:19:04,279
Does it work?

889
01:19:04,386 --> 01:19:06,616
There's a dial tone.

890
01:19:06,688 --> 01:19:09,156
Maybe we should call them.

891
01:19:09,258 --> 01:19:13,422
No. They said Friday afternoon.
It's still Friday afternoon.

892
01:19:13,495 --> 01:19:15,827
But it's not Friday afternoon
in New York.

893
01:19:15,898 --> 01:19:19,265
- Seriously, we should just give 'em a call.
- They'll call.

894
01:19:19,334 --> 01:19:21,825
We don't wanna look desperate.

895
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:28,009
Hello? Diaper...

896
01:19:29,278 --> 01:19:30,575
It's not... Which?

897
01:19:30,646 --> 01:19:32,876
Hello?
There. Hello?

898
01:19:32,948 --> 01:19:35,712
Diaperush. This is Oliver speaking.

899
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:38,680
Yeah.

900
01:19:41,924 --> 01:19:43,858
Right.

901
01:19:46,195 --> 01:19:50,529
Right.
OK, so...

902
01:19:50,599 --> 01:19:52,567
We'll talk to you next week then.

903
01:19:56,038 --> 01:19:57,903
Thank you.

904
01:20:06,348 --> 01:20:08,942
- We got it.
- Oh! Oh! We got it, baby!

905
01:20:09,384 --> 01:20:10,942
We got it!

906
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:17,449
Oh, yes!

907
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:18,550
Yes!

908
01:20:18,627 --> 01:20:19,958
Yes!

909
01:20:20,028 --> 01:20:21,518
Yes!

910
01:20:35,544 --> 01:20:38,012
That is one special lady.

911
01:20:38,847 --> 01:20:40,838
I'm gonna miss her.

912
01:20:42,417 --> 01:20:45,545
Well, no one can say
we didn't try, right?

913
01:20:48,624 --> 01:20:51,889
- Just need the keys.
- Oh! Yeah.

914
01:20:52,761 --> 01:20:55,355
Hey, can I hang on to the key chain?

915
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:59,161
- They're, like, 25 bucks.
- You serious?

916
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:02,567
Yeah.
Aw, keep it.

917
01:21:03,205 --> 01:21:05,571
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

918
01:21:09,611 --> 01:21:11,602
You need a ride?

919
01:21:14,516 --> 01:21:18,043
Just gonna clear some stuff
outta my office.

920
01:21:21,123 --> 01:21:23,318
This was fun.

921
01:21:27,429 --> 01:21:29,659
Hey, you come to LA, give me a call.

922
01:21:29,731 --> 01:21:31,926
Yeah, definitely.

923
01:23:52,507 --> 01:23:54,771
Does the artist ever come in here?

924
01:23:54,843 --> 01:23:58,836
Most days.
You just missed her, actually.

925
01:24:36,451 --> 01:24:39,477
Hi.
Back again?

926
01:24:42,691 --> 01:24:43,658
Yep.

927
01:25:18,727 --> 01:25:20,456
Chris.

928
01:25:21,163 --> 01:25:24,655
Not so far.
Just come back. There you go.

929
01:26:40,909 --> 01:26:42,240
I...

930
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:46,178
Just don't say anything,
'cause I'll lose my nerve.

931
01:28:00,989 --> 01:28:03,321
You suck!

932
01:28:03,391 --> 01:28:05,791
I know ya like Bon Jovi, so...

933
01:28:07,128 --> 01:28:09,119
I don't.

934
01:28:10,565 --> 01:28:12,192
Emily...

935
01:28:13,668 --> 01:28:15,192
I'm flat broke.

936
01:28:16,771 --> 01:28:20,867
I don't have a job.
I don't have a plan.

937
01:28:22,544 --> 01:28:24,171
And I know I'm...

938
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:28,542
I know I'm probably six years too late...

939
01:28:30,251 --> 01:28:32,742
but will you give me strike one back?

940
01:28:39,527 --> 01:28:41,757
You're married.

941
01:28:47,068 --> 01:28:49,195
I'm engaged.

942
01:28:54,909 --> 01:28:57,309
Do you wanna come in?

943
01:29:00,081 --> 01:29:03,482
No.
I think I need the air.

944
01:29:06,154 --> 01:29:08,918
I'm... I have to get the baby.

945
01:29:08,990 --> 01:29:11,754
I'm sitting for Michelle.

946
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:16,253
You sound really good.

947
01:29:38,586 --> 01:29:41,384
Well...

948
01:29:41,456 --> 01:29:48,225
guess when I'm an old man,
I'll never have to wonder,

949
01:29:48,296 --> 01:29:50,526
"What if?"

950
01:30:43,585 --> 01:30:45,382
So how long have you
had this place, Ben?

951
01:30:45,453 --> 01:30:49,583
Going on four years,
but I still have a lot of plans for it.

952
01:30:49,657 --> 01:30:52,785
Oh, I'm sure Em would be happy
to help you with those plans.

953
01:30:52,861 --> 01:30:55,329
I'm sure she will.

954
01:31:54,889 --> 01:31:59,690
This is a phase that I am glad
you grew out of. I don't even recognize you.

955
01:31:59,761 --> 01:32:02,855
Ugh! That skirt.

956
01:32:02,931 --> 01:32:04,899
Oh, those are great boots.
Do you still have those?

957
01:32:04,966 --> 01:32:06,058
Not the boots.

958
01:32:06,167 --> 01:32:07,964
Well, what am I looking for here?
The guy?

959
01:32:08,036 --> 01:32:10,334
- No, not the guy.
- Whatever happened to that guy?

960
01:32:10,405 --> 01:32:13,568
The photos.
They're from before we met.

961
01:32:13,641 --> 01:32:16,769
- Before you and who met?
- Me and Oliver.

962
01:32:16,845 --> 01:32:20,474
- What are you talking about?
- He took them before I even saw him.

963
01:32:20,582 --> 01:32:23,278
So he did make the first move.

964
01:32:24,319 --> 01:32:26,617
Kind of.

965
01:32:26,688 --> 01:32:29,122
- You ready?
- I gotta go.

966
01:32:29,190 --> 01:32:31,124
I'm gonna stop by tomorrow, OK?
I'll help you move.

967
01:32:31,192 --> 01:32:33,956
- Where you going?
- Michael needs a new suit.

968
01:32:34,028 --> 01:32:35,962
I can't let him shop alone.

969
01:32:45,473 --> 01:32:47,771
Talk. Tell me.
Do I look fat?

970
01:32:47,842 --> 01:32:50,333
Seriously.
The pinstripes, they make me look fat?

971
01:32:50,411 --> 01:32:52,777
Michael, this is the seventh suit
you've tried on today.

972
01:32:52,847 --> 01:32:54,144
What do you want me to say?
It's a suit.

973
01:32:54,249 --> 01:32:56,843
Oh, I just need some, you know,
give in the shoulders.

974
01:32:56,951 --> 01:32:58,748
- I just need a little...
- Yeah, well, they do alterations.

975
01:32:58,820 --> 01:33:00,515
Move.

976
01:33:00,588 --> 01:33:02,419
- Yeah.
- Shirts, huh?

977
01:33:02,490 --> 01:33:04,890
That's a nice shirt.
Look at this one.

978
01:33:04,959 --> 01:33:06,586
Shirts.

979
01:33:06,661 --> 01:33:08,424
Those legs,
they go all the way to the floor.

980
01:33:08,496 --> 01:33:11,158
- Here.
- Socks. Yeah.

981
01:33:11,232 --> 01:33:14,463
- About done here?
- Hold on now.

982
01:33:14,535 --> 01:33:18,027
We don't want our pants falling down
in the middle of "I do."

983
01:33:18,106 --> 01:33:21,542
Nobody wants to see that.

984
01:33:29,817 --> 01:33:32,377
Thought you quit smoking.

985
01:33:33,855 --> 01:33:35,550
I did.

986
01:33:49,337 --> 01:33:51,362
What's goin' on, Em?

987
01:34:03,618 --> 01:34:04,642
Oh, all right, what are you doing?

988
01:34:05,954 --> 01:34:07,421
I don't care, you have to wait.

989
01:34:07,522 --> 01:34:08,887
- Mom!
- What?

990
01:34:08,957 --> 01:34:10,925
- Have you seen my tie?
- I don't... Did you look in your room?

991
01:34:10,992 --> 01:34:13,290
Yes. I don't know where it is.

992
01:34:13,361 --> 01:34:15,488
You better find it.

993
01:34:15,563 --> 01:34:17,292
Is that my tie?

994
01:34:17,365 --> 01:34:18,457
- Mom.
- What?

995
01:34:18,533 --> 01:34:20,524
- Graham took my tie.
- Why did he take your tie?

996
01:34:20,601 --> 01:34:23,627
I don't know.
Why? Give it to me.

997
01:34:24,439 --> 01:34:27,203
Hi, I've been trying this number
all morning and I was just wondering

998
01:34:27,275 --> 01:34:28,970
if you could find out
if there's something wrong with the line,

999
01:34:29,043 --> 01:34:30,567
or if it's been disconnected,

1000
01:34:30,645 --> 01:34:32,510
or if I can make an emergency
breakthrough.

1001
01:34:34,782 --> 01:34:37,376
- She's sleeping.
- OK. OK. Thanks anyway.

1002
01:34:37,485 --> 01:34:38,679
Is everything packed?
I brought the minivan.

1003
01:34:38,786 --> 01:34:43,086
- I'm not moving.
- What's going on?

1004
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:48,088
Ben and I broke up.

1005
01:34:48,162 --> 01:34:50,153
Honey.

1006
01:34:51,232 --> 01:34:54,998
Are you OK?
Why didn't you call me?

1007
01:34:55,069 --> 01:34:57,970
- What happened?
- I had to do this.

1008
01:34:59,574 --> 01:35:04,443
OK. We are gonna sit down
and we are going to take a deep breath.

1009
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:07,978
It's gonna be fine.

1010
01:35:08,249 --> 01:35:11,150
It is so natural to be nervous
before you get married.

1011
01:35:11,219 --> 01:35:13,517
Do you remember me?

1012
01:35:13,588 --> 01:35:15,818
Don't worry, Ben is gonna understand.

1013
01:35:15,890 --> 01:35:18,825
You just need to talk to him.
Just set a time to meet.

1014
01:35:18,893 --> 01:35:20,793
Tell him you need a day or two
to think things over.

1015
01:35:20,862 --> 01:35:23,956
- I have to call Oliver.
- Oliver?

1016
01:35:24,032 --> 01:35:26,830
- Who doesn't have call waiting?
- Sweetie.

1017
01:35:26,901 --> 01:35:28,960
I have to talk to him.
I have to tell him I'm not getting married.

1018
01:35:29,037 --> 01:35:31,164
Stop.
Give me the phone.

1019
01:35:31,806 --> 01:35:35,503
- I saw him.
- You saw who?

1020
01:35:36,511 --> 01:35:38,502
Oliver.

1021
01:35:40,048 --> 01:35:42,516
Emily...

1022
01:35:42,583 --> 01:35:45,074
he's getting married.

1023
01:35:47,922 --> 01:35:49,890
When?

1024
01:36:01,669 --> 01:36:03,261
Hi, I have a phone number
and I was wondering if

1025
01:36:03,337 --> 01:36:05,862
you could give me the address
that goes with that phone number.

1026
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:07,407
What are you gonna say?

1027
01:36:07,475 --> 01:36:10,137
I'm gonna say I broke it off with Ben.
I'm just gonna tell the truth.

1028
01:36:10,211 --> 01:36:12,907
Oh, no, no.
I wasn't speaking to you. Sorry.

1029
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:15,448
OK, you ready?
Here it is.

1030
01:36:15,516 --> 01:36:18,178
I forgot the number.
Find the number.

1031
01:36:18,286 --> 01:36:22,222
- Hold on, I'm looking, I'm looking.
- She's looking, she's looking.

1032
01:36:30,198 --> 01:36:32,223
Big day!

1033
01:36:33,201 --> 01:36:35,635
Are you ready, gentlemen?

1034
01:36:36,637 --> 01:36:39,037
Ready?
Yeah.

1035
01:36:39,107 --> 01:36:42,201
- All right.
- Let's get started.

1036
01:37:11,105 --> 01:37:12,367
Hello?

1037
01:37:40,535 --> 01:37:43,732
Honey, are you OK?
Shall I call a doctor?

1038
01:37:43,804 --> 01:37:46,898
I'll get somebody to help you.
Go get somebody to help her.

1039
01:37:46,974 --> 01:37:48,100
- Call 9-1-1.
- Just get her some ice...

1040
01:37:48,176 --> 01:37:49,973
Are you OK?

1041
01:37:50,344 --> 01:37:53,245
- I got it. I got her.
- I'm sure there's a doctor...

1042
01:37:53,347 --> 01:37:55,645
- I got her. It's fine.
- OK.

1043
01:37:56,317 --> 01:37:58,945
- You OK?
- Yeah.

1044
01:37:59,053 --> 01:38:02,420
- What are you doing here?
- I'm so sorry. I have to go.

1045
01:38:02,523 --> 01:38:04,684
Excuse me, are you here with the ice?

1046
01:38:06,427 --> 01:38:07,917
How did you find me?

1047
01:38:07,995 --> 01:38:11,260
I had your number and I just...
I called Information and got your address.

1048
01:38:11,332 --> 01:38:14,927
Wow. Information sure gives out
a lot of information.

1049
01:38:15,002 --> 01:38:16,697
- I got this.
- All right.

1050
01:38:16,771 --> 01:38:19,934
It's good, thanks.
Is your head OK?

1051
01:38:20,007 --> 01:38:22,032
Ollie!
We're waiting on you, son.

1052
01:38:22,109 --> 01:38:24,270
Yes.

1053
01:38:24,345 --> 01:38:27,644
You should go.
I'm gonna go.

1054
01:38:31,052 --> 01:38:33,316
Oliver.

1055
01:38:34,021 --> 01:38:35,579
OK.

1056
01:38:48,803 --> 01:38:50,236
Emily.

1057
01:38:55,009 --> 01:38:56,169
No.

1058
01:39:01,616 --> 01:39:04,312
It's too late.
I'm too...

1059
01:39:09,423 --> 01:39:11,152
Oliver!

1060
01:39:11,225 --> 01:39:13,716
What's going on?

1061
01:39:14,562 --> 01:39:16,826
You're not too late.

1062
01:39:18,266 --> 01:39:21,963
I'm not getting married,
my sister is.

1063
01:39:23,904 --> 01:39:26,168
You're such a dick!

1064
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,607
Let's go. Let's start without him,
you guys. Come on.

1065
01:39:34,715 --> 01:39:36,615
Let's go.

1066
01:39:36,684 --> 01:39:38,276
Don't.

1067
01:39:38,386 --> 01:39:40,013
You'll ruin it.
