1
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:38,631
I can't find the translation
for any of these hieroglyphs.

2
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,100
That's because you're focusing
on the Fourth Dynasty...

3
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:50,115
...while these particular glyphs are derived
from Third Dynasty regional variants.

4
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:56,015
"And so through these stones,
we summon down the powers of the gods. "

5
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,884
Slow down. Slow down.

6
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,390
A square on every level.

7
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:05,987
No more than. 01 percent error
in any of these walls.

8
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,960
As Napoleon himself exclaimed:

9
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,467
And for 4000 years,
until just 100 years ago...

10
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,475
...it stood as the tallest
structure on Earth.

11
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,219
Look at those support stones
along the edge.

12
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,015
If even one of these stones
was but an inch out of alignment...

13
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:36,222
...the entire Great Pyramid
would come crashing down.

14
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,458
How did they do it?

15
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:46,863
How did these primitives...

16
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,600
...unlock the majesty...

17
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,472
...the mystery of trigonometry...

18
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:55,273
...and calculus...

19
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,344
...engineering centuries ahead
of their time?

20
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,155
The answer?

21
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,221
They reached past themselves...

22
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,629
...and they touched the divine.

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,961
Summoned the muse.

24
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,765
Forged what is indeed
the greatest...

25
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:23,431
...of the original
Seven Wonders of the World!

26
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:30,839
Sorry. Somebody spill a mochaccino?

27
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,882
Yeah, right over there.

28
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,280
Thanks.

29
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:45,297
Hey, Flynn, you wanna stop fricking posing
and join the rest of the students?

30
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,303
Bravo!

31
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,276
Well done!

32
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,309
I want to thank...

33
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:08,886
I want to thank you all
for a great semester.

34
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:16,618
And despite what the naysayers
have been spouting...

35
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,993
Yes. We will show, for the first time...

36
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:25,535
...at perfect one-twentieth scale,
using real pyramid stones...

37
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,969
...exactly what
the Great Pyramid looked like...

38
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,666
...complete with its missing capstone.

39
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,411
Right. Right.

40
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:37,210
Let's go back to work, shall we?
Well done.

41
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,113
- Professor.
- Yes?

42
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,654
I've been doing some thinking.

43
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,816
I think I might be more useful
managing the translation team.

44
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,689
- Yes.
- They don't seem to grasp...

45
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,557
Alas, Flynn...

46
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,030
...you won't be continuing on
with the pyramid project.

47
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,691
Sorry.

48
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,666
But I'm your best student.

49
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,104
That's the problem.
You are my best student.

50
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,867
You are everyone's best student.

51
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,307
You've never been anything
but the best student.

52
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,642
Honestly, Flynn, I'd be doing you
a disservice to let you continue.

53
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,011
Well, that's unfair and confusing...

54
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:16,315
You already have, what,
four degrees in Egyptology?

55
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,322
Flynn, do you really need a fifth?

56
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,928
I'm weak on the Second Dynasty,
and I'm relatively useless on the Sixth.

57
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,532
How many degrees
do you have in total, Flynn?

58
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,167
- Not that many.
- I checked your transcript.

59
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,269
You have 22.

60
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,997
Professor, school is what I know.
It's what I'm good at.

61
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:37,370
It's where I feel most like myself.

62
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:40,569
You've been in this class
with these kids for three months now.

63
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,271
Do you even know their names?

64
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,915
- Of course I do.
- Oh, come on.

65
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,483
That's insulting.
Okay, I don't know anybody's name.

66
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,712
The reason is because
we all use nicknames.

67
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,446
Yes.

68
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,090
Hey.

69
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,987
Sweater guy.

70
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,985
Freak.

71
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,987
Right back at you.

72
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,134
You're a professional student, Flynn.

73
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,737
You're avoiding life.

74
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,430
This is a serious problem
that I will no longer enable.

75
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,372
Professor, I have a very full life...

76
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,375
Oh, come on, don't give me that.

77
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,138
Have you ever been out of the city?

78
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,148
When was the last time
you went dancing or to a ball game?

79
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,945
Okay, wait a second now!

80
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:24,146
- What is it exactly that you're doing...?
- You need to find a job, Flynn!

81
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,519
To get some real-life experiences.

82
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,992
Flynn, I've already spoken
with the administration.

83
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,654
- And I have signed off on your degree here.
- No, no.

84
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,959
Congratulations.

85
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,364
- It's the middle of the semester!
- Yes, it is.

86
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,529
- I can't sign up for a program for months.
- Exactly.

87
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,766
No, no. Please, no. Don't.

88
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,206
All I wanna do is learn.

89
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,176
We never stop learning, Flynn. Never.

90
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,646
It's only where we learn that changes.

91
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:56,153
And it's about time you started doing it
in the big, bad real world.

92
00:05:56,322 --> 00:06:00,156
- Professor...
- Sink or swim, Flynn.

93
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,817
- Professor...
- No, no, look ahead, that way.

94
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,553
Come on.

95
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,426
Good luck.

96
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,089
Off you go.

97
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:46,095
My brilliant boy has returned
from a long day of getting more brilliant.

98
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,796
Mom, please.

99
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,005
Not today.

100
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,480
Come in.

101
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,512
More books?

102
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,550
These aren't just books.

103
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,260
This is Aristotle. Voltaire. Jung.

104
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:15,897
These books are slices
of the ultimate truth...

105
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:19,595
...from the greatest thinkers of all time.

106
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,001
And they speak to me.

107
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,743
They speak to you?

108
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,579
Like nothing else.

109
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:33,082
Do they tell you to do bad things?

110
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,580
- I'm going out.
- Do they tell you to set fires?

111
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,783
Don't listen to the books
if they tell you to set fires...

112
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,590
...or to hurt small animals.

113
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,056
Wait. Wait.

114
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,666
Where are you going?

115
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,427
I'm going to the bookstore.

116
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,764
Oh, good, she's here.

117
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:56,039
- Who?
- She's a nice girl. You'll just say hello.

118
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,872
And one more thing,
don't do what you always do.

119
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,271
Come in. Come in.

120
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,082
Debra, Flynn.

121
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,812
Flynn, Debra.

122
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,014
You two look great together.

123
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,121
I'll leave you two kids alone.

124
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,292
Would you like to sit down?

125
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:37,273
- No, thanks. Carbs.
- No?

126
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,613
- How did my mom...?
- Friends with my mom.

127
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,915
They're so obsessed with
getting us into relationships.

128
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,523
Yes, exactly.

129
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:49,457
You'd think that we were just sitting
in our houses, locked in our rooms.

130
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,790
I know, right? It's...

131
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,428
So tell me, Debra, what do you do?

132
00:08:58,604 --> 00:08:59,832
I'm a social worker.

133
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,501
Really?

134
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,006
Oh, well, that's great.

135
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,974
Do you work with kids
or old people or...?

136
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,410
No, no. Convicted felons.

137
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,442
Killers, mainly. What do you do?

138
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:14,817
Actually...

139
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,279
...I'm a student.

140
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,792
You've been a college student
your entire...?

141
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,019
- I like to learn. Is that a crime?
- No.

142
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:26,722
I mean, so what? I've spent most,
if not all, of my adult life in school.

143
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,595
Maybe I've missed out on
some "extracurricular" activities.

144
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,294
- That doesn't make me a freak, does it?
- Of course not.

145
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,835
- I understand.
- You do?

146
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,998
Sure. You like to learn.

147
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,070
- Yes.
- And you're in your 30s and still in school.

148
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,215
- Exactly.
- And you live with your mother...

149
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:44,974
...and you're okay with that.
- Yes.

150
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,778
No. No.

151
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,352
Wait.

152
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,514
I have to change my life.

153
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,291
- I would.
- Anyone thirsty?

154
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:58,890
Yeah, I wish I could stay,
but I really have to get back to work.

155
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,657
You're going?

156
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,198
So soon?

157
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:06,361
It was nice meeting you all.
I hope things work out for you.

158
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,871
Thank you.

159
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:16,142
Mom, can you please
not do that anymore?

160
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,307
I just want my boy to find love.
Is that so terrible?

161
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,419
I will.

162
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,650
One day.

163
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,051
When it's right.

164
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,819
The things that make life worth living...

165
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:32,863
...you know, they can't be thought here.

166
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:38,027
They must be felt here.

167
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,207
Maybe you don't know so much.

168
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,718
"Assistant data processor. "

169
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,384
"Fry cook. "

170
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:53,243
<i>You have been selected to interview
for a prestigious position...</i>

171
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:57,075
<i>...with the Metropolitan Public Library.</i>

172
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:01,013
Now, how did you do that?

173
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,145
How may I help you, sir?

174
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,982
Next!

175
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,090
Next!

176
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,690
I've never been treated so badly
in my entire life.

177
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,885
This is ridiculous.

178
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,693
Next!

179
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,643
Next!

180
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,854
I'm not... I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna...

181
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,423
Where do you think you're going?

182
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,925
Yes, you. Get in here.

183
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:46,074
What makes you think
you could be the Librarian?

184
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,978
Well, I've read a lot of books.

185
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:51,821
Don't try to be funny.

186
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,390
I don't do funny.

187
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,823
I'm sorry.

188
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:04,199
What makes you think
you could be the Librarian?

189
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,804
I know the Dewey decimal system,
Library of Congress...

190
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:10,169
...research paper orthodoxy, web searching.
I can set up an RSS feed.

191
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:11,809
Everybody knows that.

192
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:14,104
They're librarians.

193
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:19,980
What makes you think
you're the Librarian?

194
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:24,719
I know other stuff?

195
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,551
Mr...

196
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,291
..."Flynn Carsen"...

197
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,430
...stop wasting my time.

198
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:37,501
Tell me something you know that nobody
else who has walked in here could tell me.

199
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,044
You have mononucleosis.

200
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,616
Your marriage broke up two months ago,
you broke your nose when you were 4...

201
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,879
...and you live with three cats.

202
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:59,391
Is that what you had in mind?

203
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,256
Swollen parajugular lymph nodes
and distended eyelids are clearly mono.

204
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,298
It takes three months for an indentation
on the ring finger to completely disappear.

205
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,264
Yours is approximately two-thirds gone.

206
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,870
Your surgeon gave you
a terminus paralateral scar...

207
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,370
...which is given to children
under the age of 6.

208
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,066
And I can clearly see three
distinct types of cat hair.

209
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:24,044
A white Himalayan, a tortoiseshell
and an orange-striped tabby.

210
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,852
I didn't break my nose till I was 5.

211
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,616
<i>What's more important than knowledge?</i>

212
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:39,089
- Where did that come from?
- Just answer the question.

213
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,425
More important than...

214
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:51,632
The things that make life worth living
can't be thought here...

215
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,246
...they must be felt here?

216
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,446
The interviews are over.
Send everyone home.

217
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,623
Not you.

218
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:11,923
There will be a six-month trial period.
If you don't screw up...

219
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,325
...then you will officially be the Librarian.

220
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:20,101
Until then, if you are one minute late,
I will dock your pay.

221
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,832
If you break anything,
I will dock your pay.

222
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,839
- Got it?
- Yeah. Tell me what I said...

223
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,639
...that was good so that I know
for the next time.

224
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,145
<i>Mr. Carsen.</i>

225
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,419
There isn't going to be a next time,
Mr. Carsen.

226
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,915
You are about to begin a wondrous
adventure, from which...

227
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,151
...you will never be the same.

228
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,963
Welcome to the Library.

229
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:50,297
I'll show you where you'll be working.

230
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:04,081
I've never worked in a library before, but
isn't this a lot of security for some books?

231
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,446
This is the most secure place in the world.

232
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,144
Soon you'll see why.

233
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,788
If we shadows have offended...

234
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,856
...think but this...

235
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,796
...and all is mended.

236
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,334
That we have but slumber'd here...

237
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,233
...whilst these visions did appear.

238
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,808
- Very good.
- Shakespeare.

239
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,743
<i>A Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

240
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:02,232
Isn't that what the Army does
with nuclear weapons?

241
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,376
Where do you think
the Army got the idea?

242
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:52,888
You're about to see something that
few men in the world have ever seen.

243
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,730
It's 2 and a half cubits in length.
Setim wood. Gold overlay.

244
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,229
That is an exact replica
of the Ark of the Covenant.

245
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,669
It's not a replica.

246
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,512
Don't touch it or you'll be electrocuted.

247
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,377
Or as they used to say, "smote down. "

248
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,516
Am I on TV?

249
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,855
Is this one of those
hidden-camera shows?

250
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:05,724
Trust me, Flynn, this...
This is your destiny.

251
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:10,498
You are now the guardian
of all these great treasures.

252
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,202
What's hanging in the Louvre?

253
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:21,609
Well, you don't really think we'd let
the real one hang in a public museum.

254
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,579
We are very careful...

255
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,208
...about who we allow
to be the Librarian.

256
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,822
There are those who would kill
for the treasure we have here.

257
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,508
This box once belonged to a girl
named Pandora.

258
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,081
She opened it one day...

259
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:03,947
...and evil controlled the land
for 1000 years.

260
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:08,024
So I think it's best not...
Not to repeat her mistake.

261
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:10,526
This is all impossible.

262
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,192
Cell phone?

263
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,831
You talk in here...

264
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,805
...and someone far away hears you.

265
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,742
No wires.

266
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,379
Impossible.

267
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,276
Even 20 years ago,
this would have belonged in the Library.

268
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,647
Three hundred years ago, you would've
been burned at the stake for it.

269
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:39,951
Some of the items in the Library violate
the known laws of science.

270
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,888
But that is only because
our brains are so small...

271
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:46,326
...we haven't come up with laws to...
To explain them.

272
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,904
This cannot actually be Excalibur.

273
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:02,740
Only the worthy can release
the sword from the stone.

274
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,280
- Try it.
- No, no, no.

275
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,480
Not worthy, trust me.

276
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,118
How do you know if you don't try it?

277
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:15,183
Because I'm still not exactly sure
why it is that you chose me.

278
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,657
We scour the educational system,
both public and private...

279
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,390
...from a hundred countries.

280
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:26,067
We read essays, doctoral theses.

281
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:30,675
We even read those accursed
online blogs.

282
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,207
So there's a system.

283
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:35,642
Oh, there's a system
for finding candidates.

284
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,442
When it comes to choosing the Librarian...

285
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:43,953
...well, that has an odd kind of way
of working itself out.

286
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,854
Flynn, you've been studying all your life.

287
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,793
This is why.

288
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,705
The apple from the Garden of Eden.

289
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:11,938
No, actually, this is an apple I left here
a couple days ago.

290
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:15,577
This is incredible!

291
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,518
Oh, my goodness,
I cannot wait to tell my mom about this.

292
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,352
I mean, she is going to...

293
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:25,223
You are now part
of a very special community.

294
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:29,431
The secret of the Library has been kept
for thousands of years.

295
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,968
The sword is floating.

296
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,435
Neck.

297
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,165
Help.

298
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:40,744
You cannot tell anyone
anything about this.

299
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:46,145
The Librarians are the only ones
who know that this even exists.

300
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,085
Give Flynn some time.

301
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,513
You'll like him.

302
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,869
I got it, I got it, I got it!

303
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:02,383
It usually takes a new Librarian
four hours to fire up the jetpack.

304
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,789
You did it in three.

305
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,430
Congratulations.

306
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,169
The Holy Grail.

307
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,872
I broke the Holy Grail?

308
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,841
I broke the Holy Grail on my first day?

309
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,570
Did you?

310
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:37,418
Yeah, it takes a bit more than a knock
to the floor to destroy a legend.

311
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:42,795
I believe in you, Flynn.

312
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:47,428
I think there's a possibility
that you could be a great Librarian.

313
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:52,509
As great as the...
As Eldred the Truly Wonderful.

314
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,546
Eldred the Truly Wonderful.

315
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,349
Well, I would settle for
Flynn the Not So Embarrassing.

316
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:06,354
Flynn the Rather Pleasant at Parties.

317
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,160
Edward Wilde.

318
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,354
He... Oh, he must've been
the last Librarian.

319
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,522
Yes. Yes, he was.

320
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,634
God rest his soul.

321
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,008
Hey.

322
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:39,683
My boy has a job! Let's celebrate!

323
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,849
Oh, I made your favorite cake.

324
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:45,558
- You shouldn't have done that.
- This is a big day.

325
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,894
Now tell me...
Tell me about your new job.

326
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:54,300
Sixteen years of college,
all those fancy degrees.

327
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:56,599
What are you doing?

328
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,642
Librarian.

329
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:02,874
Librarian?

330
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:07,712
Mom, I have finally found my place.

331
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:13,290
Sixteen years of college,
and you're putting books on shelves.

332
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:16,518
Well, there's a little bit
more to it than that.

333
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:21,130
In fact, I'm not exactly allowed to say
exactly how much more to it there is.

334
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,562
But if you knew...

335
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,527
...Mom...

336
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,538
...you would be so proud of me.

337
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,767
I am proud of you.

338
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,707
Now go get yourself
a big piece of cake.

339
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,078
Everything went exactly as you said.

340
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,324
After all that, you gonna tell us
what we stole?

341
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:35,499
The realization of a 5000-year-old dream.

342
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,006
7:01.

343
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,978
You're late. You're gonna have to
dock your own pay.

344
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,009
Coffee?

345
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,916
Oh, I hate a kiss-ass.

346
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,796
Why is this door open?

347
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,625
Oh, my...

348
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,436
- No.
- Are you all right?

349
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,988
I think he's up.

350
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,124
The surveillance tape.

351
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,870
They knew about the fail-safe.

352
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,709
They only had time to take one item.

353
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:59,617
They...

354
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,021
...took the Spear of Destiny.

355
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:06,153
Do you know about the Spear of Destiny?

356
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,765
It's the spear that...

357
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:11,993
...supposedly pierced the side
of Jesus on the cross.

358
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,534
An ancient talisman reported
to have mystical powers.

359
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,574
Whoever controls the Spear,
controls the fate of the...

360
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,507
...world.
- For thousands of years...

361
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,807
...whoever had the Spear,
from Charlemagne to Napoleon...

362
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:28,111
...became the greatest conqueror
in the world.

363
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:32,320
Well, that's just a fragment of the Spear.

364
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,159
The Spear was too powerful
to remain intact.

365
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,265
But since you can never
completely destroy the Spear...

366
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:45,766
...the Librarian hundreds of years ago
broke it into three pieces...

367
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:49,805
...and scattered the three pieces
in secret places around the world.

368
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:52,909
Well, with the Spear all broken up...

369
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,840
...it can't still be a threat, can it?

370
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,806
Hitler had only one piece.

371
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:02,942
One can only imagine how powerful
all three are.

372
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,027
The Serpent Brotherhood.

373
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,194
Serpent Brotherhood?

374
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:21,270
What, did these guys play a lot
of Dungeons & Dragons?

375
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,963
They were a splinter group...

376
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:26,508
...back when the Library was
in Alexandria in ancient times.

377
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:31,911
They were scholars too, but they wished
to use the powers of the artifacts to rule.

378
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:37,077
They got their name from the serpent
that brought knowledge to Adam and Eve.

379
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:40,884
Disagreement led to hatred,
hatred led to a secret war.

380
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:44,756
They incited the riot that led
to the destruction of the first Library.

381
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,397
Well, then we better call the police.

382
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,796
Oh, yeah, call the police.

383
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:56,236
Tell them about the Spear of Destiny,
the golden goose, the lost Ark.

384
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,170
Enjoy your stay in the psych ward.

385
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,834
I understand Thorazine
comes in vanilla now.

386
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,168
Right.

387
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:06,784
Nobody can understand the mysteries of the
Library tradition unless they experience it.

388
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:11,248
You are the only one who can
bring the Spear piece back.

389
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:17,891
No. No, no.

390
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:20,263
There's gotta be somebody
more qualified.

391
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:23,332
Flynn, you are the only one for the task.

392
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:27,460
You are the only one on Earth
for the task.

393
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,071
Look at it this way...

394
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,868
...if you come back, you'll be a hero.

395
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:35,276
Well, that sounds very...

396
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,913
- If I come back?
- Things aren't as bad as they look.

397
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:41,108
When she says, if I come back,
I'm hearing I'm not coming back.

398
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,219
I don't wanna go if I can't come back.

399
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:44,821
They didn't take the book.

400
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,958
If you ever wanna hide something,
hide it in plain sight.

401
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:53,664
This book contains all the clues you'll need
to locate the other two pieces of the Spear.

402
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:57,726
The only thing that I know
for certain is that...

403
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:02,566
...the second piece is somewhere
in the Amazon jungle.

404
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:07,677
Well, good, that narrows it down
to about 3 million square miles.

405
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,073
Okay.

406
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:12,045
Time is money. Come on.

407
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,083
- Is this the Language of the Birds?
- Yes.

408
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:19,382
Mankind's universal language.

409
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:23,789
That is, before God decided that man
should speak many tongues...

410
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:26,725
...after the Tower of Babel.

411
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,298
This has been a dead language
for thousands of years.

412
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,697
There's nobody alive that
knows how to read it.

413
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,134
So you better get cracking.

414
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:41,545
Even with the Rosetta stone, it took
hundreds of Egyptologists 17 years...

415
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:43,737
...to decipher the Egyptian hieroglyphics.

416
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,975
Well, you have considerably less time.

417
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:50,348
You know this is my first day,
and I don't even have a parking place.

418
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:54,514
You should have a parking place before
you get assigned to fight an evil conspiracy.

419
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:58,719
If the Serpent Brotherhood should ever
get their hands on the three pieces...

420
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,489
...trust me, it would be horrible.

421
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,863
But just remember one thing,
the most valuable object in the world...

422
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,163
...is not here in the Library.

423
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:10,364
It's right here.

424
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:27,654
The fate of the world is in my hands?

425
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,895
That is just so...

426
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,496
...sad.

427
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,600
Oh, God, help us all.

428
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,825
Excuse me. Can I help you, sir?

429
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,429
Your seat's back there.

430
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:08,690
Thanks.

431
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:16,268
- This way.
- Here, let me help you with that.

432
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:35,456
<i>Oh, one more thing I forgot to tell you.</i>

433
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,093
<i>Trust no one.</i>

434
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:41,461
<i>And guard the book with your life.</i>

435
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,232
Did anybody else...?

436
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,738
Nobody saw...?

437
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:59,713
The vowels are Akkadian, but the
consonants are both early Sumerian...

438
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,877
...and Indian and Hebrew.

439
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:08,217
The genders are Sanskrit,
the phonemes are Etruscan, with certain...

440
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,327
Certain semantic features of Víteliú.

441
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,520
Sorry, I was just...

442
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,689
...thinking out loud.

443
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:34,011
It was sweet of you to let me watch from
the cockpit, but I think I should take my...

444
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,617
I was hoping to have the aisle seat.

445
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,122
One sec.

446
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,230
I'll come visit later. I promise.

447
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,361
Any time.

448
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:03,143
Believe it or not,
this is actually my first plane flight.

449
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:06,943
Let's stop for a moment and consider.

450
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,485
I am way out of your league. Way out.

451
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,254
If your league were to explode...

452
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:17,019
...I wouldn't hear the sound
for another three days.

453
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:20,721
So for everybody's sakes,
let's just enjoy a companionable silence.

454
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,169
I did it.

455
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:12,078
I did it. I just learned the...
I just learned the Language of the Birds.

456
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:15,047
Didn't even have a Rosetta stone.
I just did it in...

457
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,852
...seven hours and 26 minutes.

458
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:24,120
Sorry, sorry.
Go back to being radiant.

459
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,360
The golden ratio.

460
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:37,564
- The golden ratio...
- You're about to say the ratio of 1.618-1...

461
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:41,610
...has been proven to be the key to
everything in nature that we find beautiful...

462
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:47,217
...and that my face is the most perfect
example you've ever seen of that ratio.

463
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,819
How could you possibly know that?

464
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,922
Because every geek I've ever met
has tried to hand me that line.

465
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,196
I'd love for you to join us in the cabin,
see the sunrise over the Amazon.

466
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,597
Of course you would.

467
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,229
I would...

468
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,466
"Of course you would. "

469
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,268
"Of course you would. "

470
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:16,903
<i>We're at 11,000 feet
and starting our descent.</i>

471
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:22,683
Excuse me. We have a problem.
Are you the air marshal?

472
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,115
Yes, I am.

473
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:35,996
That's the Librarian?

474
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,865
Don't underestimate him.

475
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:47,534
Sorry. I just need to get past you.
I need to use the bathroom.

476
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,303
Hey.

477
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,572
Hey.

478
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,018
Again, not impressed.

479
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,165
- Who are you?
- Would love to talk...

480
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,630
...but really don't have the time.

481
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,403
- Who are you?
- The woman who's trying to save your life.

482
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:21,977
Get him! Get him!

483
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,147
What are you doing?

484
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,046
We're going out.

485
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:36,024
Don't tell me you're afraid of heights!

486
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:39,651
It's just that I know that the odds...

487
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:44,961
...of an untrained guy like me
surviving a jump from 11,000 feet...

488
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:48,434
...is 7-2 against.

489
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,874
What are your odds now?

490
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:11,957
He brilliantly lowers our expectations
and then jumps without a chute.

491
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:15,188
Remarkable!

492
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,640
Don't look down.

493
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:26,173
I think I'm gonna be sick.

494
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:32,812
Who in the hell are you?

495
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:37,249
Don't get your knickers in a twist, Carsen.
Judson told me to look out for you.

496
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:40,213
Well, Judson told me to trust no one.

497
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:41,789
Oh, yeah?

498
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:44,826
Well, I'm Nicole Noone.

499
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,595
No one.

500
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,095
Didn't they tell you to expect me?

501
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:54,226
No. Nobody told me anything.

502
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,997
I have no idea what I'm doing.

503
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,239
Really?

504
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,444
No, no calls. They'll use the signal
to triangulate our location.

505
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,014
Well, that's against the law.

506
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:08,515
They tried to kill you. You think they care
about breaking phone-tapping regulations?

507
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,711
They didn't just try to kill me.

508
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:14,881
They just wanted to inject me with sodium
pentothal so I'd tell them where I hid...

509
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,892
...the book.
- Who'd have thunk it?

510
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:21,123
You know, if you really wanna
hide something...

511
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:22,890
...you do it in plain sight.

512
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:26,025
How did you get that on the airplane?

513
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:28,398
Me, they confiscate my nose-hair clipper.

514
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:31,439
Where the hell are we?

515
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:33,740
I have no idea.

516
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,539
Well, you're the brains
of the operation. Figure it out.

517
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,810
Oh, you think I can't?

518
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,744
I could just climb that tree right there.

519
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,819
In a matter of seconds, I can
tell us exactly where we are.

520
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:46,747
Well, I'm not stopping you.

521
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,560
That tree.

522
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,251
Do you need a hand?

523
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:27,495
I'm fine.

524
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,234
You go get them, monkey boy.

525
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:06,831
Let's hear it, genius.

526
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,797
All right.

527
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,072
Okay.

528
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:17,713
Well...

529
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:22,384
That...

530
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,817
...is an extremely rare blue condor.

531
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:29,220
Found only within a 100-mile radius
of the Amazon's Purus tributary.

532
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,691
The only mountain tall enough
to have a snowcap...

533
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:35,923
...this time of year in that radius
is Mount Pôrto Velho.

534
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:41,629
We are at minus 5.2 degrees latitude
and minus 64.6 degrees longitude.

535
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:43,033
English?

536
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,998
We need to go 24.7 miles...

537
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,235
...that way.

538
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,281
Isn't this...?

539
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:57,677
<i>So how'd you do that?</i>

540
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:04,584
Just your basic geography,
biology, botany.

541
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,629
That, and I memorized the Earth.

542
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:08,992
You're kidding, right?

543
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,363
You need to get out more.

544
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:13,769
Yeah, people keep telling me that.

545
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:21,542
- You always travel with a machete?
- I'm well-prepared.

546
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:25,671
- That, or maybe you're a violent sociopath.
- You say the sweetest things.

547
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:30,183
How many miles have we walked anyway?
Five? Ten?

548
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,515
- Maybe one.
- Hello.

549
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:36,022
Another person here.
A little consideration, please.

550
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:42,655
Hey.

551
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,466
Unknown plant phylum.

552
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,662
I can't believe it.

553
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,769
If you're nice, I'll name it after you.

554
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,375
Be still, my heart.

555
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:57,505
<i>Ficus narcissus.</i>

556
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,179
Hey.

557
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:03,615
You're supposed to be
the best tracker in the Amazon.

558
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:06,222
Get tracking.

559
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:22,164
See, anything is possible
in the world of books.

560
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,398
I guess that makes me a dreamer.

561
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:27,408
My mother said that my father
was a dreamer.

562
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:30,542
He died when I was little.

563
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:35,617
I guess I've subconsciously tried
to make up for his absence by...

564
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:36,810
Hey.

565
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:40,923
By behaving like him as
much as I possibly could.

566
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,983
I can't believe I never made
that realization before.

567
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,827
Sorry, did you say something, cupcake?

568
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:52,298
I figure that since we're gonna be spending
so much time together, we might as well...

569
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,528
...get to know each other a little bit.

570
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,431
You seem like the observant type.

571
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:58,836
I like to think so.

572
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:03,537
Then you must've observed that I'm not the
type who's suddenly gonna open up to you.

573
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,648
How long have you worked
for the Library?

574
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,148
And yet you keep trying.

575
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:11,913
I just want to get to know the Nicole
below the surface arrogance.

576
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:14,216
Peel back the layers.

577
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,383
What do you think's below
the surface arrogance?

578
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,926
More arrogance.

579
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:22,759
And then perhaps a few
delicious layers of flaky disdain...

580
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:26,664
...all around a creamy sweet
center of homicidal rage.

581
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:29,829
What do I have to do
to get you to shut up?

582
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,300
Okay, I won't ask you
any more questions.

583
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:39,142
So how long have you
worked for the Library?

584
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,681
- Five years.
- Well, do these...

585
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:46,949
...jumping-out-of-airplane-jungle-adventure
things happen to you often?

586
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:49,788
What happened to the last Librarian?

587
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:53,821
You don't need to know about me.
I don't need to know about you.

588
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:56,158
We just need to work together.

589
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,094
So...

590
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:01,966
...nothing good, then.

591
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,013
It's the only way across.

592
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,393
There is no way.

593
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:29,657
Look.

594
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:33,230
The support beams, they're decomposed.
This wood is completely rotted.

595
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:36,702
There is no way that this bridge
can structurally support our weight.

596
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,971
Nicole.

597
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:43,803
Nicole!

598
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,413
Take a chance, big boy.

599
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,757
Don't look down.

600
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:07,099
Why?

601
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,794
Why do I always do that?

602
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:11,941
Focus on something else.
You must have a girlfriend, right?

603
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:17,513
Big glasses, dirndl skirt? Makes you
watch a lot of subtitled documentaries.

604
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:22,642
- I'm between girlfriends at the moment.
- I had the feeling.

605
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:29,122
Have you figured out exactly
where the second piece is yet?

606
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:32,719
You know, most of the clues
are pretty self-explanatory.

607
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,322
Except for this one.

608
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:37,763
To get inside...

609
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:44,365
...you must know the time it takes
a bird to become a bird again.

610
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,838
Any idea what that means?

611
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:49,141
You, brains. Me, brawn.

612
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:53,245
I cannot believe that I was wrong
about this bridge.

613
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,481
I really didn't think that this
would support our...

614
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,854
Flynn!

615
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:02,316
Flynn! Flynn!

616
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,357
Take my hand!

617
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,962
Reach. Reach for my hand!

618
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,657
Come on, that's it.

619
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,328
Keep coming.

620
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,262
That's it, come on.

621
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:14,995
Keep reaching. There you go.

622
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,132
Well, I hope you're having fun.

623
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:19,207
Actually, I am.

624
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,272
That wasn't so bad, was it?

625
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:33,213
- Run!
- I told you!

626
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,722
I told you this bridge couldn't
support our weight!

627
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:38,292
Less talk! More running!

628
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:39,724
Jump!

629
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:56,302
So, what do you do for fun?

630
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:01,248
I can kill a man 57 different ways.

631
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:06,355
That's good. Let that out, that sensitive
soul inside of you that's yearning to be free.

632
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:11,517
You may know everything in the world, but
you have no idea what sets my soul free.

633
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:13,990
Really?

634
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,286
To get inside...

635
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:42,892
...you must know the time it takes
a bird to become a bird again.

636
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:49,121
Time it takes a bird to become a bird again.
Bird, bird, bird.

637
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:51,767
That's gotta be some kind of metaphor.

638
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:57,062
Usually the bird stands for reaching
some sort of unattainable height...

639
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,708
...like a mountain or...

640
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:07,811
I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Maybe I'm not as smart as I thought I was.

641
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:11,215
Nobody talks about the Librarian like that.
Not even the Librarian.

642
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:18,353
Okay.

643
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,761
Hey, you wouldn't happen to have
any toilet paper anywhere...

644
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:27,162
...on your body, would you?

645
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:30,063
Knock yourself out.

646
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,678
Nicole. Come here.

647
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:49,585
- Serpent Brotherhood.
- Do you think they saw us?

648
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,094
- No, but just to be safe...
- Should we go, or are we staying?

649
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,857
They wouldn't dare make
that climb till morning.

650
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:58,057
You can go to the bathroom.

651
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,166
Lost the urge.

652
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,245
Chilly without that fire.

653
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,276
Wind-chill factor.

654
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:19,413
Yeah.

655
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,615
We're gonna have to do something
pretty desperate to keep warm.

656
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:27,695
This is where you tell me the only way we'll
survive is if we huddle together for warmth.

657
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,225
Well, if you insist.

658
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,960
- Body warmth only. Got it?
- Got it.

659
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:42,444
That's Sheliak...

660
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,011
...and Terebellum, Cassiopeia.

661
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:49,716
Don't tell me you memorized
the universe.

662
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:51,979
Well, the known universe.

663
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,784
Nicole.

664
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:03,430
What happened to the last Librarian?

665
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:07,999
He died.

666
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:09,833
End of story.

667
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:13,703
- I'm no good at remembering details.
- You're the type that remembers everything.

668
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:15,601
You don't know anything about me.

669
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:18,475
You're the youngest of three siblings
and the only girl.

670
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:23,142
Your mother's English, your father's South
American, Argentinean, but you never...

671
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,818
You never bothered to learn Spanish.

672
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,154
You never had any pets.

673
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:32,928
Your favorite stone is jade.

674
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:40,868
And you wish more than anything that
you could forget half of what you've seen.

675
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:43,906
But you can't.

676
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:53,642
- Well, I could do the same thing about you.
- Be my guest.

677
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:58,782
Nerd.

678
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,490
Fair enough.

679
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,598
The last Librarian...

680
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,140
...Edward Wilde.

681
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:25,614
Edward was charming.

682
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:27,911
Handsome.

683
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:29,779
Absolutely brilliant.

684
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,716
We spent two years working together.

685
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:35,584
Two incredible years.

686
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,387
But he wasn't just smart.

687
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:46,162
He was generous, kind.

688
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:48,762
He could look into your eyes...

689
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:51,801
...and see right into your soul.

690
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:58,212
And I did the one thing I'm
not supposed to do on this job.

691
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:01,984
I fell in love with him.

692
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,312
And because of that, he's dead.

693
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:07,818
We were in the Antarctic.

694
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:10,716
We were sleeping in an igloo
that he built.

695
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:13,825
When I woke up in the morning,
he wasn't there.

696
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:18,458
And I ran outside just in time to
see the Serpent Brotherhood...

697
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:20,034
...cutting off his head.

698
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:23,469
I had one job...

699
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,575
...protect the Librarian, and I failed.

700
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,645
We're surrounded.

701
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:38,814
I don't see anybody.

702
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,151
Oh, them.

703
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:48,554
There have been rumors of headhunters
operating in this area.

704
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:51,894
Now is not the time to panic.

705
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:55,666
Tell that to him.

706
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:02,238
- Talk to them. What are they speaking?
- I can't quite make out their dialect.

707
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:04,676
It has elements of Kugapakori...

708
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:07,908
...the syntax of the Yanomamis,
maybe even the Amahuacas.

709
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,149
You push me one more time with that...

710
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,380
Don't piss them off.
That's not a good idea.

711
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:55,457
It was just Portuguese.
I was overthinking it.

712
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,274
Oh, they're doing a mongo dance.

713
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:16,418
I did a master's thesis
on native mating rituals.

714
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:19,716
This is a huge honor for us.

715
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:48,007
It appears that they think
that we're some kind of couple.

716
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:50,449
Well, we wouldn't want to offend them.

717
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,350
So...

718
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:00,725
- I'll sleep over there.
- Bingo.

719
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:11,037
- What? What does that look mean?
- Nothing.

720
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:15,167
It's not your fault.

721
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:18,405
The last Librarian.

722
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:21,748
I mean, we're human beings.

723
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:26,617
We can't control
who we fall in love with.

724
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:30,621
Look, you've done a great job
keeping me alive...

725
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,727
...and I know that that hasn't been easy.

726
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:35,923
I appreciate that.

727
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:46,334
What is that? Please tell me
you forgot to take your medication.

728
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:50,036
Come on, admit it,
it's getting you a little hot, isn't it?

729
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:53,944
No, hot's not exactly the word I'd use.

730
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:57,275
You know, these mating rituals,
they look a little ridiculous...

731
01:00:57,453 --> 01:00:59,614
...but these natives
really know their stuff.

732
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:02,189
Over there. Now. Go.

733
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:04,519
Pretend like it's not
getting to you a little.

734
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:06,685
Good night, Flynn.

735
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,590
Good night, Nicole.

736
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:17,295
Oh, yeah.

737
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:20,067
She wants me.

738
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:23,144
Good night.

739
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:44,763
Flynn?

740
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:49,261
Where's the funny guy I was with?

741
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,588
They are here.

742
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:25,665
Flynn!

743
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:29,977
Move. Come on.

744
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:37,015
Move! This way, through the hut.
The book!

745
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:39,518
I know, I know. I got it, I got it.

746
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:43,954
They're right behind us. Move.

747
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:53,028
Flynn, run.

748
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:01,401
They're right behind us.

749
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,572
- Flynn, come on, stop looking back. Move.
- Nicole, wait.

750
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:10,048
Bad guys chasing behind us.

751
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:20,418
Don't ever leave my sight again,
understand?

752
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:23,224
What is this, Slap the Librarian Day?

753
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:28,430
Oh, I get it, you're just being professional.
It isn't as if you genuinely care for me.

754
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:30,435
Shut up.

755
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:33,401
Why are you smiling?
I don't like it when you smile.

756
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:35,840
That means you're about
to do something dangerous.

757
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:38,276
Oh, you know me so well.
Don't look down.

758
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:48,880
Did you see that?

759
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:51,049
That Librarian is incredible.

760
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:55,858
Flynn.

761
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,130
Flynn, take my hand.

762
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,905
- Nicole!
- Come on!

763
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:06,063
Flynn!

764
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:15,714
Flynn!

765
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:22,050
- Nicole. Nicole.
- I got you.

766
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:31,760
According to the book, we take this river
and follow the sun until it ends.

767
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:41,737
And I do believe the sun has ended.

768
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:02,156
All right. Now we're close.

769
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,624
All we have to do...

770
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:07,765
...is walk the circumference
of the Earth...

771
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:11,031
...divided by the length
of the Fortress of Ollantaytambo.

772
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:15,075
Oh, yeah? And how the hell
are we gonna figure that out?

773
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,576
Seven hundred and ninety-two yards.

774
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,442
That way.

775
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:24,484
One, two, three, four.

776
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:27,020
Five, six.

777
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:32,686
Seven hundred and ninety, 791, 792.

778
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:38,762
Well, there's nothing.
You must have got something wrong.

779
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,597
I don't get facts wrong.

780
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:44,796
It's everything else I screw up.

781
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,812
When the Toltecs invaded Chichén Itzá...

782
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:56,713
...it was rumored
that a group of Mayan priests...

783
01:05:56,886 --> 01:05:59,878
...fled Mexico with their entire treasury.

784
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:01,887
As the story goes...

785
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:06,586
...they built a Mayan temple deep
in the Amazon jungle to hide the treasure...

786
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,266
...never to be heard from again.

787
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:21,504
So how do we get inside, genius?

788
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:24,108
Those are Mayan numbers.

789
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:29,547
Mayan priests were obsessed
with numbers.

790
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:32,950
- Oh, you'd fit right in.
- The time it takes a bird to become a bird.

791
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:37,422
To get inside you must know the time
it takes a bird to become a bird again.

792
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:43,226
- The procession.
- Yay! What is that?

793
01:06:43,399 --> 01:06:46,857
The time it takes the constellations,
what Mayans called "birds of heaven"...

794
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:51,598
...to make a complete revolution
around the galaxy, 25,765 years.

795
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:54,607
The Mayans were the first to discover it.

796
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:57,171
All right.

797
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:00,138
Twenty-five thousand.

798
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:07,521
Seven hundred.

799
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,951
Sixty-five.

800
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,795
Watch out!

801
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:51,856
Where are we?

802
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:54,928
I am not sure.

803
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:05,643
We are in a Mayan death chamber.

804
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:09,848
Escape is granted only to those
who can solve the secret of the room.

805
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,513
Yep.

806
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:16,848
The only way out...

807
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,921
...is that doorway on the other side.

808
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:24,294
Okay, so how do we get to that door?

809
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:28,135
That's the secret.

810
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:40,142
That's not good.

811
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:43,285
We have to find a way to get
to that doorway on the other side...

812
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:45,249
...before the wall pushes us
into the abyss.

813
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:46,649
- Oh, really?
- Yep.

814
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:49,552
- Any clues in that book of yours?
- No, no.

815
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:54,559
- Okay, we're on our own.
- So now what?

816
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:55,958
I'm not sure.

817
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:59,158
Now would be a damn good time
to come up with something brilliant.

818
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:02,498
"Sure, Flynn, just figure it out.
That's why you're on the mission. "

819
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:05,902
Focus. Big mission. Fate of the world.

820
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:11,510
- Nothing's coming to me.
- Great. Choking, just like I knew you would.

821
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,342
Hey. Oh, I get it, reverse psychology.

822
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:16,178
- Good.
- No, not reverse psychology.

823
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:18,752
- Anger, annoyance.
- Okay, I got it.

824
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:21,947
This is an exact replica
of their Great Temple of Teotihuacán.

825
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:24,888
<i>Three hundred quahuitls by 20 quahuitls.</i>

826
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:27,824
There is a place in this chamber
where all priests...

827
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:32,730
...could receive salvation no matter what,
and that place would be...

828
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:36,470
...there?

829
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,936
That's midair, Sherlock.

830
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,603
You trust me?

831
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:45,941
You only live once.

832
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:49,144
- Unless you believe in Buddhism or Sikhism.
- I hate you.

833
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:50,808
Well...

834
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:04,530
Optical illusion. Mirrors.

835
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:09,694
The Mayans were the first tribe
in the Americas to use them.

836
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:12,397
Good.

837
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,272
There it is.

838
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,844
- There's the second piece.
- No.

839
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:08,590
Well, it's an exact rhythm.

840
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:12,862
One, two, three. One, two, three.

841
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:17,096
- Why does that sound so familiar?
- It's called a waltz.

842
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,037
We have to dance our way
to the treasure.

843
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:25,306
I broke every toe of every girl
that I danced with at my high school prom.

844
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,973
Even my mother wouldn't dance with me.

845
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:32,143
- You took your mother to the high school...?
- All right, all right. Don't start.

846
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:36,189
Come on, we'll do it together.
It's easy. It's all in the hips and the butt.

847
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:40,988
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

848
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:42,391
- No, no.
- What?

849
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:45,260
- Not yet. Not ready yet.
- One, two, three. One, two, three.

850
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:48,631
- One, two, three. One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

851
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:52,069
- One, two, three. One, two, three.
- One, two, three. One, two, three.

852
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:10,056
- Shouldn't I be the one dipping you?
- Technically.

853
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:40,918
You better have a damn good reason
for doing that.

854
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:44,856
Yeah, well, these things
are always booby-trapped.

855
01:12:57,306 --> 01:13:01,140
- I'll do it.
- No, I can do it. I can do it.

856
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:03,801
I just forgot to factor in...

857
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:06,341
...the slope of the floor.

858
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:20,022
- So there.
- Okay.

859
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:40,878
This means that all biblical history
has to be reevaluated.

860
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:43,244
Why don't you get
the last piece of the Spear...

861
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:46,547
...and then you and Judson can have
a lovely long chat in Aramaic...

862
01:13:46,722 --> 01:13:50,681
...about all the history stuff
while I take a shower.

863
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,851
I believe the phrase is "hands up. "

864
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:58,797
Up.

865
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:10,339
I really admire your work.

866
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:34,902
I knew you'd bring me the piece, Nicole.

867
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:40,338
- Edward?
- You're the last Librarian.

868
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:42,507
Wait a minute.

869
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:46,170
- You're dead.
- And yet, here I stand.

870
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:50,250
- I saw you die.
- You saw an elaborate special effect.

871
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:54,345
Your tears were perfect.
I couldn't have planned it better myself.

872
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:57,053
So they really didn't cut off your head.

873
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:00,451
You're the Librarian?

874
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,221
But why?

875
01:15:03,398 --> 01:15:06,799
Absolute power
is the ultimate aphrodisiac.

876
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:12,134
You remember how I loved
a good aphrodisiac.

877
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:15,436
I'll kill you, you bastard.

878
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:23,314
Goodbye, Nicole.
It really was nice to see you again.

879
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:30,284
- You can't kill her.
- Why not?

880
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:33,690
Because you need me
to find the last piece.

881
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:37,389
And I won't do it without her.

882
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,496
I don't need you.

883
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:45,630
I have this.

884
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:56,540
The Language of the Birds.

885
01:15:57,953 --> 01:15:59,818
Nobody can read this.

886
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:02,252
Nobody except a real Librarian.

887
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:12,462
In the Language of the Birds,
that means you're up the creek...

888
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:14,101
...and I've got the only paddle.

889
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:19,003
Tell me where the piece is,
and I'll let her live.

890
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:21,108
- Don't tell him.
- It's in Shangri-la.

891
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:23,938
Don't screw with me. That's a legend.

892
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:26,740
Shangri-la is in Mount Kailas.

893
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:29,810
- In the Himalayas.
- Idiot.

894
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:32,954
Excuse me for trying
to save your life again.

895
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:36,022
The Spear is more important than my life.

896
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:39,285
He's not gonna get
anywhere near that spear.

897
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:43,196
Unless I interpret the clues in that book.

898
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:12,189
That's Mount Kailas.

899
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:14,056
Where's your Shangri-la?

900
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:17,357
We can't find it from the air.
All the clues are on the ground.

901
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:26,766
Lars, we're gonna have to climb.
Get ready to take her down.

902
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:30,309
At least you didn't fail at your job.

903
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:32,839
He's still alive.

904
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:37,176
No, he just faked his own death...

905
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:40,810
...and became head of the very
evil organization we've been fighting.

906
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:43,082
That's much better.

907
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:39,770
It's this way.

908
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:52,251
Flynn! No!

909
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,660
I got you.

910
01:18:57,999 --> 01:18:59,990
Hold on.

911
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:02,799
Nicole.

912
01:19:06,108 --> 01:19:07,837
Come on.

913
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:18,610
Not on my watch.

914
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:34,900
You're leading me on a wild-goose chase.

915
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:43,672
I should kill you myself.

916
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:51,706
Welcome.

917
01:20:52,247 --> 01:20:55,216
It's been long prophesied
that you would come today.

918
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:58,713
We want the Spear piece.

919
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:15,728
It is hidden inside.

920
01:21:15,904 --> 01:21:17,838
Open it.

921
01:21:18,006 --> 01:21:20,167
We are the mere keepers.

922
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:23,903
We have no idea how to open it.

923
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:27,679
Well, fortunately, he does.

924
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:39,519
Get the Spear piece,
or I blow her brains out.

925
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:55,708
- Oh, this can't be right.
- What?

926
01:21:55,877 --> 01:21:58,846
Well, it says that this
can only be opened...

927
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:01,676
...with the name of God.
- So?

928
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:05,479
So the name of God
is only the biggest secret in the world.

929
01:22:05,654 --> 01:22:09,351
For 4000 years people have tried to find it.
You want me to do it in 15 seconds?

930
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:31,643
M- E.

931
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:43,749
Me.

932
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,422
God is within us all.

933
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:05,805
Go ahead, take it.

934
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:14,949
No.

935
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:18,853
No.

936
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:21,052
You take it.

937
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:35,202
Problem?

938
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,339
No.

939
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:52,493
Lars, fly up here now.

940
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,321
Track my signal.

941
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:57,322
It's about time.

942
01:24:14,115 --> 01:24:15,742
I want the Spear piece, Nicole.

943
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:19,250
A man in hell wants ice water.
Doesn't mean he's gonna get it.

944
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:21,549
No.

945
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:25,352
Wait. Get back. Get the Spear.
Get the Spear.

946
01:24:27,595 --> 01:24:30,086
Hold on. We have to get the Spear piece.

947
01:24:30,265 --> 01:24:32,256
Wanna hide something,
do it in plain sight.

948
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:38,363
Guard it well. The Spear opens a door
that must be kept closed.

949
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:44,642
Hey.

950
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:50,249
Flynn, you have to fly this thing.

951
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:52,943
Okay.

952
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:55,554
No problem.

953
01:24:55,723 --> 01:24:57,520
The main principles are lift...

954
01:24:57,692 --> 01:24:59,819
...and thrust.

955
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:03,324
Easy as pie.

956
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:13,607
Horrible. Horrible.

957
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:16,471
High-velocity pie of death.

958
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:31,115
Well, I've seen worse.

959
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:48,775
<i>- Mr. Carsen.
- Hey.</i>

960
01:25:49,277 --> 01:25:50,505
Judson.

961
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:53,374
You and everyone at the Library
can completely relax.

962
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:57,484
We have the third piece of the Spear,
and it is right...

963
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:03,654
Right here. Completely safe.

964
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:08,728
<i>Good work. I still can't believe
that Wilde joined the Serpent Brotherhood.</i>

965
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:10,558
<i>He was a fine Librarian.</i>

966
01:26:10,732 --> 01:26:12,063
<i>Thank goodness we have a...</i>

967
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:14,299
<i>A better one now.</i>

968
01:26:15,603 --> 01:26:17,901
<i>You better get the door.</i>

969
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:25,139
Someday he's gonna have to tell me
how he does that.

970
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:41,653
Excuse me, but I didn't
order any champagne.

971
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:47,828
But I did.

972
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:54,933
You're not the incredible pansy
I thought you were.

973
01:26:56,511 --> 01:27:00,106
And you're not the raving psychopath
I originally thought that you were.

974
01:27:01,649 --> 01:27:03,207
Well, you are.

975
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:05,682
But in a good way.

976
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:14,626
What's wrong?

977
01:27:16,764 --> 01:27:18,163
You're smiling.

978
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,433
You must have read books
on how to make love.

979
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:22,831
Hundreds.

980
01:27:31,312 --> 01:27:33,872
Flynn's busy. He'll call you back.

981
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:41,884
A woman just answered
my son's telephone.

982
01:27:46,561 --> 01:27:49,724
A woman just answered
my son's telephone!

983
01:27:49,897 --> 01:27:52,422
- Yes! Yes!
- Yeah.

984
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:25,966
Nicole?

985
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:58,595
What's the matter? Haven't you guys
seen a naked guy in a sheet before?

986
01:28:58,766 --> 01:29:01,098
<i>Is something wrong, Flynn?</i>

987
01:29:01,903 --> 01:29:03,871
Nicole is missing,
and so is the Spear.

988
01:29:04,038 --> 01:29:06,268
Serpent Brotherhood
may have taken her, or...

989
01:29:06,441 --> 01:29:07,772
<i>Or...</i>

990
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:10,035
She may have been in cahoots
with Wilde all along.

991
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:12,412
Cahoots.

992
01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:14,578
I've been cahooted.

993
01:29:14,749 --> 01:29:16,808
<i>All right, all right, all is not lost.</i>

994
01:29:16,984 --> 01:29:19,282
<i>It took a great power
to sunder the Spear.</i>

995
01:29:19,454 --> 01:29:23,151
<i>It'll take even more
to fuse the pieces together again.</i>

996
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:25,220
How much?

997
01:29:25,693 --> 01:29:28,321
<i>Strip the mysticism aside,
and you'll need a...</i>

998
01:29:28,496 --> 01:29:33,832
<i>A local electromagnetic field
registering over 15 on the...</i>

999
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:35,559
<i>On the Schumm scale.</i>

1000
01:29:36,304 --> 01:29:38,829
Okay. Good.

1001
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:41,133
Only time energy like that's
been registered...

1002
01:29:41,309 --> 01:29:44,870
...was during a peak full moon at
the Great Pyramid when it had its capstone.

1003
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:48,140
And the Egyptian government
refuses to replace...

1004
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:51,017
...the capstone.

1005
01:29:53,187 --> 01:29:56,088
The next peak full moon
is tomorrow night.

1006
01:29:56,457 --> 01:29:58,789
Call the Marines, Judson.

1007
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,928
I'm coming home.

1008
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:10,264
Clothes. I need the clothes.

1009
01:30:27,155 --> 01:30:28,679
Flynn.

1010
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:31,381
We can get in
through the ventilation system.

1011
01:30:34,328 --> 01:30:35,955
Where are the Marines?

1012
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:37,793
Semper fi.

1013
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:40,965
You were a Marine?

1014
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:44,166
Good. Wonderful.

1015
01:30:44,338 --> 01:30:46,898
Well, now, let's...
Let's get that spear back.

1016
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:06,517
Well, well.

1017
01:31:06,694 --> 01:31:08,958
Professor Harris.

1018
01:31:09,397 --> 01:31:11,228
I should've known he was evil.

1019
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:13,629
He gave me an A-minus.

1020
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:29,509
Serpent Brothers,
our dream comes true tonight.

1021
01:31:32,753 --> 01:31:34,948
Doesn't that guy ever die?

1022
01:31:37,992 --> 01:31:39,823
There doesn't seem
to be much...

1023
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:42,394
...cahooting going on now.

1024
01:31:42,563 --> 01:31:46,124
We call down the power
of the gods.

1025
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:47,528
The ancient ones.

1026
01:32:13,794 --> 01:32:15,921
<i>Snake! Snake!</i>

1027
01:32:16,831 --> 01:32:18,662
<i>Snake! Snake!</i>

1028
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:20,465
Come on.

1029
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:34,873
This house...

1030
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:37,916
...a gateway to eternal life.

1031
01:32:38,185 --> 01:32:39,743
This weapon...

1032
01:32:39,921 --> 01:32:43,288
...with the blood of one
who defied death.

1033
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:49,128
I claim power of life and death.

1034
01:33:12,153 --> 01:33:13,518
I can't do this alone.

1035
01:33:13,688 --> 01:33:15,155
Well, you got me, you know?

1036
01:33:15,323 --> 01:33:18,258
Well, no offense, Judson, but you're...

1037
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:21,455
A bad mother.

1038
01:33:21,629 --> 01:33:24,564
Well, I was a Librarian too, you know.

1039
01:33:40,214 --> 01:33:42,239
Oh, yes.

1040
01:33:43,017 --> 01:33:45,110
I feel the power.

1041
01:33:46,153 --> 01:33:48,348
The power of life.

1042
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:51,322
And the power of death!

1043
01:34:41,208 --> 01:34:42,436
At last, Nicole...

1044
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:46,311
...we can be one.

1045
01:34:57,892 --> 01:34:59,587
Kill them.

1046
01:35:07,601 --> 01:35:10,001
Houdini, Prague, 1926.

1047
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:14,799
We have to get the Spear
back to the Library.

1048
01:35:25,352 --> 01:35:26,751
Get the Spear away from Wilde.

1049
01:35:26,921 --> 01:35:28,320
Before he gets too powerful.

1050
01:35:37,031 --> 01:35:39,693
There's no way I'm going
to let you...

1051
01:35:41,435 --> 01:35:43,266
You broke my nose.
How dare you, Flynn.

1052
01:35:43,437 --> 01:35:47,601
Yeah, I did what you said, learned a few
things in the big, bad real world.

1053
01:35:58,486 --> 01:36:00,010
It doesn't have to be this way.

1054
01:36:00,788 --> 01:36:02,756
We're gonna rule the world.

1055
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:04,288
We could be together.

1056
01:36:08,529 --> 01:36:10,759
Get your own geek.

1057
01:36:36,423 --> 01:36:38,414
Too late, Flynn.

1058
01:36:38,659 --> 01:36:41,059
The power of the Spear is mine.

1059
01:36:46,066 --> 01:36:49,467
You're the best
they could come up with?

1060
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:52,230
You're pathetic.

1061
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:16,527
You're too clumsy to even die properly.

1062
01:37:16,697 --> 01:37:18,858
You say that now,
but I danced with your girl.

1063
01:37:45,893 --> 01:37:49,556
Die assured that the Librarian
will be in far more capable hands.

1064
01:37:49,964 --> 01:37:51,431
Mine.

1065
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:11,409
You keep your grubby hands to yourself.

1066
01:38:15,489 --> 01:38:18,117
Anyone else want a piece of me?

1067
01:38:36,143 --> 01:38:37,610
Goodbye, Librarian.

1068
01:38:45,085 --> 01:38:48,714
If even one of the support stones
are off even by an inch...

1069
01:38:50,624 --> 01:38:52,216
...the whole pyramid collapses.

1070
01:38:54,194 --> 01:38:57,630
- I'd say this was out of alignment.
- I will destroy you.

1071
01:38:57,798 --> 01:38:59,163
You never will.

1072
01:38:59,333 --> 01:39:01,164
Know why?

1073
01:39:01,502 --> 01:39:05,563
Because the things that make life
worth living can't be thought here.

1074
01:39:05,739 --> 01:39:07,707
They must be felt here.

1075
01:39:42,309 --> 01:39:43,970
I believe...

1076
01:39:44,144 --> 01:39:47,170
...this belongs to the Library.

1077
01:40:48,742 --> 01:40:51,176
Left, left, left.

1078
01:40:51,345 --> 01:40:53,711
Small steps. Small steps.

1079
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:56,475
What are you guys doing?

1080
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:02,014
Okay. Okay.

1081
01:41:22,776 --> 01:41:24,334
I hope you saved receipts.

1082
01:41:51,205 --> 01:41:55,972
Flynn is a librarian now,
but he's capable of so much more.

1083
01:41:56,543 --> 01:42:01,003
He just needs the right woman
to push him.

1084
01:42:01,348 --> 01:42:02,576
Mom.

1085
01:42:02,749 --> 01:42:06,480
You don't understand. Being a Librarian
is actually a pretty cool job.

1086
01:42:07,454 --> 01:42:09,684
And you don't need to keep trying
to fix me up.

1087
01:42:09,857 --> 01:42:11,688
I told you that.

1088
01:42:11,892 --> 01:42:14,360
The mysterious Nicole.

1089
01:42:15,362 --> 01:42:18,092
She's never quite around
to meet the mother.

1090
01:42:18,999 --> 01:42:21,627
Well, it's complicated.

1091
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:38,684
Hey, handsome.

1092
01:42:43,557 --> 01:42:44,785
Nicole, this is my mother.

1093
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:47,790
A pleasure to meet you,
Mrs. Carsen.

1094
01:42:47,961 --> 01:42:51,021
No, no, the pleasure is mine.

1095
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:56,000
The Deadly Scorpion League
has found H.G. Wells' time machine.

1096
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:58,764
- Only we can get it back.
- Deadly Scorpion League.

1097
01:42:58,939 --> 01:43:01,703
What is it with bad guys
and insect names for their cults?

1098
01:43:03,110 --> 01:43:05,442
Mom, I gotta get going.

1099
01:43:06,046 --> 01:43:07,638
See you soon.

1100
01:43:09,416 --> 01:43:12,351
You're smiling. Why are you smiling?

1101
01:43:12,519 --> 01:43:15,317
There's a dozen time-traveling ninjas
out to kill us.

1102
01:43:15,956 --> 01:43:19,084
- Psychopath.
- Nerd.

1103
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:21,687
Hey, hey.
