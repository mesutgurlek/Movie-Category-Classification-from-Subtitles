(Upbeat rock 'n' roll music)

6
00:01:59,407 --> 00:02:01,238
I got chills

7
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:03,124
They're multiplyin'

8
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:07,402
And I'm losin' control

00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:11,721
'Ca.use the power you're supplyin'

It's electrifyin'

-You're the one tha.t I wa.nt
-You a.re the one I wa.nt

12
00:02:17,127 --> 00:02:19,197
Oo-oo-oo, honey

13
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:21,084
-The one tha.t I wa.nt
-You a.re the one I wa.nt

14
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:23,476
Oo-oo-oo, honey

(Upbeat dance music)

18
00:02:47,087 --> 00:02:50,124
-You can all dance like that.
-No. Impossible.

19
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:51,806
You can.

20
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:53,525
Dance is like love.

21
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:59,119
Just move your feet
to the beat of your heart.

22
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:07,122
Go, yes!

23
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:09,516
Come on, follow your inner beat!

24
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:18,723
RAMU: Come on, ladies.

25
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:22,240
Move your feet to the beat of your heart.

26

(Women giggle and laugh)

27

(Music stops)

28
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:30,879
I told you you could do it.

29
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:34,042
Ladies, I have an announcement.

30
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:37,001
I'm sad to say
that today will be my last day here...

31
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:38,884
at Shanti Dance and Modern Movement.

32
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:40,320
-What?
-No.

33
00:03:40,407 --> 00:03:44,366
Next week, my classes will be taken over
by Sister Munju Murthi, a nun from Kerala.

34
00:03:44,447 --> 00:03:47,644
-But why? Where are you going?
-To America.

35
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,639
-You're going to drive a cab there?
-A cab? No way.

36
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:52,080
I'm going to be a star.

37
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:54,362
-You can do that?
-Well, of course you can.

38
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:57,405
Anything's possible in America.
Look at my friend, Vijay Rao.

39
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,955
-The one with the red Mercedes?
-And the penthouse?

40
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:03,926
He went there with nothing.
No job, no money, no visa...

41
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:05,679
and he's a big success.

42
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:08,156
I don't want to dance with a nun.

43
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:13,442
(Slow lndian backbeat)

44
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,485
GIRL 1 : 'Bye, Ramu.

45
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:24,125
'Bye. Take care.

46
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:26,044
GIRL 2: 'Bye. We'll miss you.

47
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:32,925
(Upbeat instrumental lndian music)

48
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:36,998
(Engines and motors revving)

49
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:40,875
(Upbeat lndian song)

50
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,878
MRS. GUPTA: I wanted a spring wedding.

51
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,958
I was going to bake a mango cake.

52
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:04,845
-You'll end up working in some restaurant.
-With bad food.

53
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:07,316
Soon you'll be back,
begging me for a decent life.

54
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:10,001
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm better off staying here...

55
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:12,806
-and becoming a salaried man.
-Don't even say that.

56
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:16,357
But I tell my students,
"Move your feet to the beat of your heart."

57
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:19,200
And my heart is telling me to go to America.

58
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:21,522
I dreamt of it my whole life.

59
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:29,366
RAMU: Don't worry.

60
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,206
I'll be fine.

61
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:37,243
You'll not only be fine. You'll be famous.

62
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:39,039
Like Ricky Martin.

63
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:46,999
Mira, be careful!

64
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,160
Your bike!

65
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:32,675
Hey, man, can I get your autograph?

66
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:40,157
-So your flight was good?
-Yeah, it was good.

67
00:06:40,247 --> 00:06:42,715
-And your sister. How's your sister?
-Okay.

68
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:47,720
Is the Mercedes in the shop or something?

69
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:49,560
Or something.

70
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:54,005
This is the penthouse.

71
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:55,315
It's the top floor.

72
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:57,079
RAMU: It's the only floor.

73
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,965
RAMU: You're a real bastard, you know that?
VIJAY: Come on, ya.a.r.

74
00:07:00,047 --> 00:07:03,198
If I told you the truth,
you never would've come.

75
00:07:07,087 --> 00:07:08,202
Immigration!

76
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:09,722
Open up!

77
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:11,525
SANJIV: Oh, shit.
VIJAY: INS!

78
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:19,965
VIJAY: This is Amit. He's a nerd.
AMIT: What's up, ya.a.r?

79
00:07:20,047 --> 00:07:22,277
That's Sanjiv. He's illegal.

80
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:24,160
VIJAY: And an idiot!

81
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:28,197
Bhen ki lohdi! Yeah, I was reading, Vij.

82
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:31,925
Hey, Ramu.

83
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,603
Kya. ka.r ra.he ho, ba.ba.? Welcome.

84
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,962
SANJIV: Good to meet you.
Now the rent goes down.

85
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:39,845
Now welcome my boy Ram to America.

86
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,757
Peera.h! Peera.h!

87
00:07:47,527 --> 00:07:48,926
To America!

88
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:51,405
NEIGHBOUR: Shut the fuck up!

89
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:56,077
RAMU: I know it's been a while, but....
The penthouse is beautiful.

90
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:58,324
Vijay's doing really well.

91
00:07:58,407 --> 00:08:00,159
No, New York is great.

92
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,442
Cook says your samosas are getting cold.

93
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:04,916
That was the butler.
My samosas are getting cold.

94
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:07,077
I better go, Na.nima.. Na.ma.ste.

95
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:12,079
(Restaurant chatter)

96
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,766
(Slow sitar strumming)

97
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,600
PATRON: The guy's totally lame.

98
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:18,406
How long can that guy go
for the "working late" crap?

99
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:21,365
What is this?
I ordered the chicken tikka masala.

100
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:23,802
That is chicken tikka masala, sir.

101
00:08:23,887 --> 00:08:26,640
(Mimicking accent)
That is not chicken tikka masala, sir.

102
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,643
That is definitely chicken tikka masala.

103
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:32,719
Dude, I know chicken fucking tikka masala,
and that's not it.

104
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:36,482
So how about taking your skinny brown ass
back to the kitchen and get me some?

105
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:38,637
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, dude.

106
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:40,926
WOMAN: Oh, my God.

107
00:08:41,007 --> 00:08:42,599
(Shocked gasps from other patrons)

108
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:52,961
No chance.

109
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:56,198
I even told him you got 10 kids
and your wife's in a wheelchair.

110
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:58,847
I don't care.
I don't want that stupid job back.

111
00:08:58,927 --> 00:09:01,157
Come on, man.
You got a roof over your head...

112
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:03,442
and food in your belly.
What more do you want?

113
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:06,041
I want what you promised me in your letters.

114
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:07,481
So did you, Vij.

115
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:10,001
The penthouse, the Mercedes.

116
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:13,643
So what happened to your business empire?

117
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,604
RAMU: Huh?
VIJAY: It's not that easy.

118
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:18,520
I don't want it to be easy.
I just want my chance.

119
00:09:19,047 --> 00:09:21,003
Maybe I'm not good enough.

120
00:09:21,087 --> 00:09:25,126
Maybe all I can do is be a waiter,
but I want my chance to find out.

121
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:27,767
-Isn't that the American dream?
-You're a fool.

122
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:30,202
Do you know why they call it
the American dream?

123
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:33,120
Because it only happens
when you're asleep.

124
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:45,960
(Upbeat lndian instrumental music)

125
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:51,636
DWAIN: Next!

126
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:02,362
I'm here for the audition. Ramu Gupta.

127
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:04,922
Tell me something I don't know.

128
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:07,484
My mother comes from Hyderabad.

129
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:11,845
My father wanted to marry a Muslim girl,
but his family wouldn't let him.

130
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:14,958
Everybody's a comedian.

131
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:18,365
DWAIN: What'd you say your name was?
RAMU: Ram Chandra Gupta.

132
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:19,516
Actor.

133
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:21,041
Dancer.

134
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,479
Okay, Rammy, what would you say
your specialty is?

135
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:26,319
Well, I move smooth.

136
00:10:26,487 --> 00:10:29,638
I take instruction easily.
I'm not afraid to try new things.

137
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:31,479
Good. We like that.

138
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:33,598
How big are you hard?

139
00:10:33,927 --> 00:10:35,758
Yes, I work very hard.

140
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,838
No. Your johnson.

141
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:39,883
How big is your johnson?

142
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:42,083
RAMU: Johnson?
DWAIN: Your wand.

143
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:43,964
Your pork-sword. Your baloney pony.

144
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:46,038
Would you like to see my Macarena?

145
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:48,641
Is that what you call it
in your part of the world?

146
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:50,763
Let me see your Macarena.

147
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:56,879
(Ramu hums melody)

148
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:00,766
Hey, Ma.ca.rena.!

149
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:03,203
All right, you wanna lose the pants?

150
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,323
Is that part of the movie?

151
00:11:05,407 --> 00:11:06,681
Could be.

152
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:11,881
I get it.

153
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:14,635
Like Tom Cruise in Risky Business?

154
00:11:16,127 --> 00:11:20,006
(Piano rock 'n' roll intro)

155
00:11:21,687 --> 00:11:25,362
(Rock 'n' roll music in Hindi)

156
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,196
DWAIN: All right!

157
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:03,160
You know you could be big.

158
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:05,158
Oh, yes, sir, very big.

159
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,239
I can see that.

160
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:11,845
I must say, most guys come in here,
they wax the dolphin.

161
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:13,440
That's it. It's over.

162
00:12:13,527 --> 00:12:15,199
You dance. I like that.

163
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:16,515
Thank you.

164
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:22,004
Plus you got this really interesting look.
It's kind of an Oriental cabana boy thing.

165
00:12:22,647 --> 00:12:25,639
You're unique, Rammy.
You could be a big star.

166
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:27,479
Yes, sir. I know.

167
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:32,638
I'm telling you.
I'm the star, like John Travolta.

168
00:12:32,727 --> 00:12:35,446
"Pulp Fiction" Travolta
or "Urba.n Cowboy" Travolta?

169
00:12:35,527 --> 00:12:36,721
"Grea.se" Travolta.

170
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:39,719
-How many lines do you have?
-I haven't seen the script yet.

171
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,560
I know your lines,
just like your lines in the restaurant.

172
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:46,162
"Would you like chutney with your chapatis
or poppadums with your paneer?"

173
00:12:46,247 --> 00:12:49,683
-"Do you want nachos with your Big Gulp?"
-Piss off, man.

174
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:53,236
Oh, I'm sorry. Good for you, ya.a.r.

175
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:56,000
Come on, so tell us about it.
What role are you playing?

176
00:12:56,087 --> 00:12:58,123
SANJIV: Man in turban
working in gas station.

177
00:12:58,207 --> 00:13:02,041
You guys joke all you want,
but this is a real movie and I am the star.

178
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:04,718
(lndian sitar music)

179
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:12,124
CAMERAMAN: Clock's ticking. Come on.

180
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:14,960
DWAIN: Okey-dokey pokey.
Actors on the set.

181
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:18,282
DWAIN: Walk away. Okay? Grab that.

182
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:21,518
For a starring role,
I don't have a lot of lines.

183
00:13:23,447 --> 00:13:25,722
-What are you doing?
-Giving Mr. Happy a shine.

184
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:27,957
He gets more screen time
than your face does.

185
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:30,766
RAMU: What?
DWAIN: Any sign of our Mr. Rammy?

186
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:33,755
Okay, now, no time for nerves.

187
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:37,484
You gotta get out there.
Don't you want to be in the movie?

188
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,762
But a real movie, not...

189
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:44,004
-pornography.
-Sugar, please.

190
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:46,681
PEACHES:
Everybody has to start somewhere.

191
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:50,038
DWAIN: So it's one, two,
and the inserts and we're done.

192
00:13:51,527 --> 00:13:53,836
There's my Ja.ne. Now where's my Ta.rza.n?

193
00:13:55,927 --> 00:13:57,679
Hey, there's the Ra.m.

194
00:13:57,767 --> 00:13:59,485
Everyone meet Rammy.

195
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:02,204
DWAIN: Meet your co-star Sharrona.

196
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:04,516
Hello.

197
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:09,883
All right, let's rock. Come on.

198
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:12,643
DWAIN: Welcome to Fantasy lsland.

199
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:15,840
Okay, Rammy, you live
on this desert island, obviously.

200
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:19,397
And you've basically been in the bushes
beating your meat your whole life.

201
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:22,206
One day you're skipping along the beach,
you see this...

202
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:24,482
hot power-suited mama,
and you just wanna...

203
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:27,035
-teach her your native tongue.
-Hindi.

204
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,035
You're the junior senator from Wisconsin.

205
00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:35,359
You're investigating a nuclear dump site
that's contaminating the marine life.

206
00:14:35,447 --> 00:14:37,005
DWAIN: Okay, roll camera.

207
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:38,884
CAMERAMAN: We are rolling.

208
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:40,641
DWAIN: Action!

209
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:47,078
Hello, I'm Senator Snatch.

210
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:49,203
I'm here on official government business.

211
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:51,039
Are the natives here friendly?

212
00:14:51,127 --> 00:14:53,800
The natives here are restless, Senator.

213
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,398
You look hot in that power suit.

214
00:14:56,487 --> 00:14:59,320
I didn't realise
the tropics would be so warm.

215
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:07,724
RAMU: The temperature
isn't the only thing here that's up.

216
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:12,198
(Drums beating with increasing tempo)

217
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:14,276
DWAIN: Cut!

218
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:18,438
SOUNDMAN: Just tape it up. It'll be fine.

219
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:19,916
Brilliant.

220
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:24,166
Nice moment, Rammy,
but we're not doing this for Lifetime. Okay?

221
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:26,317
You see her, you screw her, we go home.

222
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:29,763
Also, you're happy
skipping along the beach. Life is good.

223
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:33,357
Skip. Screw. Happy. Got it.

224
00:15:34,407 --> 00:15:37,160
Guess Who's Coming a.t Dinner, take two.

225
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:41,919
Hello, I'm Senator Snatch.

226
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,486
I'm here on a--

227
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,876
(Wild drums beating)

228
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:47,366
Rough stuff.

229
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:53,321
DWAIN: Problem?
SHARRONA: We don't have wood.

230
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:55,477
Stand by. Holding on wood.

231
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:57,564
Standing by for wood.

232
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:00,918
(Shouting) We are holding on wood!

233
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:04,404
Do you have an erection problem?

234
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:07,604
-No, sir. Ask the makeup girl.
-She's a guy.

235
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:10,724
I'm more woman
than you'll ever have, pencil dick.

236
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:11,956
Sorry, dude.

237
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:13,878
DWAIN: Get hard or get going.

238
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:20,040
(Motivating himself in Hindi)

239
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:23,406
It's just sex, silly.

240
00:16:23,487 --> 00:16:25,364
CAMERAMAN: Where'd you find this guy?

241
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:26,846
DWAIN: He found me.

242
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:28,645
You know, we could've had Waldo.

243
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:31,400
No, Waldo's too hairy for this.

244
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,285
The natives don't have a lot of back hair.

245
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:38,680
It's just the idea of being naked
in front of all these people.

246
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,917
Well, the trick is not to be naked up here.

247
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,795
It's like other actors get costumes,
but we don't, or at least not for very long.

248
00:16:46,887 --> 00:16:50,004
So your naked body
is really just your costume.

249
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,515
I promise, in lndia I'm a real stud.

250
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:02,245
If you and I could just go somewhere
by ourselves...

251
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:04,445
without people watching.

252
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:07,636
There's always someone watching.

253
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,796
-Dwain?
-God, silly.

254
00:17:14,407 --> 00:17:17,683
-God is watching us?
-Yeah, but not for kicks.

255
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:21,437
I mean, the universe isn't run
by some big old perv.

256
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:24,445
What do you mean?

257
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:27,764
I mean, the same God
who made the rose and the ocean...

258
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:29,395
he made me.

259
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:32,001
And my body is made to have sex...

260
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:35,363
just like the rosebud is made to open.

261
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:39,356
Wow.

262
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,519
We're in. Places, please.

263
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:42,722
DWAIN: Short five. Sorry.

264
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:46,800
The most powerful sexual organ
God gave us is our brain.

265
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:49,760
Think about it.

266
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:51,241
Action!

267
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:56,083
Okey-dokey pokey.

268
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:58,158
(Sharrona moaning excitedly)

269
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:02,356
DWAIN: Cut!

270
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:03,955
Wha.t now?

271
00:18:04,047 --> 00:18:06,117
I can't stop thinking about God.

272
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,562
And therefore I cannot achieve wood.

273
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:09,523
DWAIN: I see.

274
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:12,201
Sharrona,
you gotta help me out here, please?

275
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:14,926
Forget it, Dwain.
If I'm late again meeting Rusty...

276
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:18,522
-he's gonna get suspicious.
-Doesn't this guy ever go to a video store?

277
00:18:20,247 --> 00:18:23,398
Hey, that's good.
This'd be a great character for you.

278
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:26,206
We haven't done a schoolteacher number
in a while. Not since...

279
00:18:26,247 --> 00:18:28,636
The Prime of Miss Jea.n's Booty.

280
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:30,365
SHARRONA: See you.
DWAIN: Please.

281
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:40,486
SHARRONA: Taxi! Taxi!

282
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:43,206
Broa.dwa.y a.nd 86th. I'm in a. hurry.

283
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:44,436
RAMU: Sharrona!

284
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:47,724
(Upbeat instrumental music)

285
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:06,559
RUSTY: Guys, you seen Miss Lynell around?
BOY: Who?

286
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:10,037
I'm telling you, bro, she's definitely
two-timing you with the librarian.

287
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:13,199
Why don't we go to O'Neill's?
We drown out your sorrows.

288
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:15,799
-Hey.
-Hey.

289
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:18,842
Thanks, guys.
I'll catch you in the a.m., Randy.

290
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:21,236
Not if I catch you first, firebug.

291
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:23,485
Where you been, princess?

292
00:19:23,807 --> 00:19:27,925
One of the foreign students had a problem
straightening out his grammar.

293
00:19:29,287 --> 00:19:30,515
'Bye, guys.

294
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:34,320
Not a very friendly group.

295
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,796
They're never nice to substitutes.

296
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:40,681
(Upbeat instrumental music)

297
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:47,041
GREETER: Nice to see you,
Mr. and Mrs. de Borman.

298
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:49,402
Service entrance is downstairs.

299
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:50,922
Okay.

300
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:55,964
EDWIN: Good evening, Lloyd.

301
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:59,399
EDWIN: Lars, your sister's locked herself
in the bathroom again.

302
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:01,239
Please, get her now.

303
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:05,206
(Upbeat instrumental music)

304
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,845
(Laughter and party chatter)

305
00:20:08,727 --> 00:20:12,515
(Conversing in Hindi)

306
00:20:12,607 --> 00:20:14,962
So, Swami, you really see the future?

307
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,242
A couple more of these and I do.

308
00:20:17,327 --> 00:20:20,160
As many of you know, our birthday girl...

309
00:20:20,247 --> 00:20:22,841
is on a little quest for spirituality.

310
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:27,966
Om.

311
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:33,158
Om.

312
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:39,963
LARS: Lex?

313
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:43,519
One more "Om"
and then you have to come to your party.

314
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:46,440
It always has to be what she wants,
even on my birthday.

315
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:49,963
I wanted a Tibetan gathering
with a Rinpoche...

316
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,835
but no, she does an lndian feast with a....

317
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,157
...world-famous swami.

318
00:20:56,727 --> 00:20:58,922
SWAMI BU: All those people care about
is sex and money.

319
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,043
If they have money, they care about sex.

320
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,163
SWAMI BU: lf they have sex,
they care about money.

321
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:06,444
If they have both, they feel guilty
and raise money for the opera.

322
00:21:06,527 --> 00:21:09,280
More tandoori in the library.
Swami, you're on.

323
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:16,686
CHANTAL: Alexandra searched
for so many years.

324
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:19,440
In the shoe department at Bergdorf's.

325
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:24,245
She has searched for the perfect diet,
the perfect rock star boyfriend.

326
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:29,677
It seems Lexi will search for anything
except steady employment.

327
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:34,801
So, dear Lexi, in honour of
your current fixation...

328
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:37,606
I give you Swami Bu.

329
00:21:38,127 --> 00:21:40,721
VIJAY: Swami Bu has gone
to another dimension.

330
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:43,318
I swear she was 16.

331
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:45,762
Mrs. Von Austerberg is going to kill me!

332
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,805
She paid a lot of money for a swami,
and now we have no swami.

333
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:51,481
We have jack shit!
Or we don't have jack shit.

334
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:53,080
I don't know which one it is!

335
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:56,204
What we do have is a drunk bastard. You....

336
00:21:56,807 --> 00:21:58,081
Didn't I fire you?

337
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:00,840
Rasphal, I was just wondering about my job.

338
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:04,364
You really want your job back?

339
00:22:04,447 --> 00:22:06,642
RASPHAL: Mr. Ramu "Tom Cruise" Gupta?

340
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:11,161
CHANTAL: Swami Bu!

341
00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:16,243
Swami Bu!

342
00:22:17,047 --> 00:22:18,924
I'm conjuring up a swami.

343
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:24,761
CHANTAL: Here he is.
Ladies and gentlemen, Swami Bu.

344
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,206
Not long ago...

345
00:22:37,207 --> 00:22:42,122
a wise man told me that
all people care about is sex and money...

346
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:44,166
and opera.

347
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:48,717
Now, myself, I don't have any money...

348
00:22:49,007 --> 00:22:51,840
well, because I'm a swami, and...

349
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:55,877
swamis don't like opera, because...

350
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:58,518
well, you can't dance to it.

351
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:02,917
So I will talk to you about sex.

352
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,963
What'd you pay for this?

353
00:23:06,047 --> 00:23:07,958
God, is it hot in here.

354
00:23:10,247 --> 00:23:11,316
God.

355
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:15,356
God wants us to have sex.

356
00:23:18,487 --> 00:23:21,923
And if God wants us to have sex,
then, well, it can't be bad...

357
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:25,525
because the universe
isn't run by a big old perv.

358
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:27,645
Glad he cleared that up.

359
00:23:27,887 --> 00:23:29,639
Your naked body...

360
00:23:30,207 --> 00:23:33,438
is like a costume that you wear
to be yourself.

361
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:36,039
Be comfortable...

362
00:23:37,407 --> 00:23:38,840
in your nakedness.

363
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:47,075
The most powerful sexual organ
God gave you...

364
00:23:47,647 --> 00:23:49,000
is your brain.

365
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:52,845
RAMU: Think about it.

366
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,405
Are you thinking?

367
00:23:56,647 --> 00:23:58,956
My whole body is about to think.

368
00:24:02,647 --> 00:24:06,720
And like roses are made to open,
so must you.

369
00:24:07,207 --> 00:24:10,836
You must open your rosebud.

370
00:24:18,527 --> 00:24:20,404
Dance is like love.

371
00:24:20,487 --> 00:24:22,364
(Electronic backbeat)

372
00:24:22,447 --> 00:24:23,675
Join me.

373
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:28,724
Follow your inner beat.

374
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:33,005
(Quickening electronic backbeat)

375
00:24:33,887 --> 00:24:36,720
-Is he doing the Macarena?
-Looks like it.

376
00:24:37,247 --> 00:24:39,283
Wait, isn't that the....

377
00:24:39,647 --> 00:24:43,276
I think it's one of those
dervish, spiritual, trance-dance things.

378
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:49,755
(Sings joyous Hindi song)

379
00:24:51,047 --> 00:24:54,926
(Upbeat Hindi dance music)

380
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:03,763
(Whistles of approval)

381
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:19,046
VIJAY: Excellent. Come on.

382
00:25:19,127 --> 00:25:22,597
(Sings joyous Hindi song)

383
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:35,717
I thought we were just going to do
some light chanting.

384
00:25:58,887 --> 00:26:01,560
(Whistles of approval)

385
00:26:16,087 --> 00:26:17,884
(Silence)

386
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:18,956
ALL: Bravo.

387
00:26:19,687 --> 00:26:21,359
The Macarena, man.

388
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:22,846
Shut up.

389
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:26,121
Swami Bu!

390
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:29,482
We're going clubbing. You want to come?

391
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:32,042
Unless it's against your religion
or something.

392
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:34,561
No, my religion believes in clubbing.

393
00:26:46,327 --> 00:26:48,238
LEXl: Swami Bu.
RAMU: Call me Ramu.

394
00:26:56,207 --> 00:26:58,357
Candles. We need candles.

395
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,365
You can't have spiritual sex
without candles.

396
00:27:07,647 --> 00:27:10,115
You must use a lot of candles in lndia.

397
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:12,437
When the electricity goes out.

398
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:19,565
Undress me slowly, spiritually...

399
00:27:20,287 --> 00:27:21,800
Iike a goddess.

400
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:24,681
Pretend I'm Vishnu.

401
00:27:25,847 --> 00:27:27,439
Vishnu is a man.

402
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:29,562
Kali?

403
00:27:29,927 --> 00:27:32,885
Kali is the goddess
of death and destruction.

404
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:35,046
LEXl: Okay. Death and destruction.

405
00:27:38,887 --> 00:27:40,036
Music.

406
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:42,286
LEXl: We need music.

407
00:27:43,967 --> 00:27:45,480
Not really, no.

408
00:27:47,247 --> 00:27:48,646
This is perfect.

409
00:27:49,047 --> 00:27:51,322
It's the Guatemalan Boys Choir.

410
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:53,200
They're deaf.

411
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:03,797
I'm having sex with a guru.

412
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:06,765
Cha.kh le.

413
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:09,725
It's so powerful.

414
00:28:09,807 --> 00:28:11,479
I can stand alone.

415
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:14,445
It feels like we're doing it. Right now.

416
00:28:14,887 --> 00:28:17,924
From there, it's like....
It feels like we're doing it.

417
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:21,716
Right now, from there,
it's like you're pulsating through me.

418
00:28:21,807 --> 00:28:24,037
It's better from here. Trust me.

419
00:28:25,927 --> 00:28:28,760
Oh, Guru, what is the most sacred position?

420
00:28:28,847 --> 00:28:30,439
(Chanting)

421
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:34,362
You may find this hard to believe,
but in lndia guru sex is very fast.

422
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:36,677
What about the slow chanting
200 position sex?

423
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:38,246
That's Tibet.

424
00:28:38,327 --> 00:28:42,036
Where I come from, we do it very fast.
Like wild monkeys at sundown.

425
00:28:42,127 --> 00:28:44,880
And if we don't,
the evil spirits might grab our tails...

426
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:47,162
and throw us into the next jungle.

427
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:49,636
(Drums beating slowly)

428
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:51,918
(Makes monkey sounds)

429
00:28:57,567 --> 00:28:59,956
You know what? Don't get me started.

430
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:02,004
You know what Father Flanagan says:

431
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:05,636
"How you gonna teach kids values
if you haven't lived them yourself?"

432
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:08,685
RUSTY: Will you hate me if I make you wait?
SHARRONA: No, I love you.

433
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:11,156
I'm proud to save myself for you.

434
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:14,636
You know what? You're the best.

435
00:29:17,247 --> 00:29:19,238
RUSTY: Honey, can I ask you a question?

436
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:21,437
How does a nice,
Catholic schoolgirl like you...

437
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:24,525
Iearn how to make
all those sexy little sounds?

438
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:27,600
Well, me and my friends
used to practice kissing.

439
00:29:27,687 --> 00:29:29,086
On our hands.

440
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:37,326
That's silly. The second half is starting.

441
00:29:38,207 --> 00:29:41,882

442

LEXl: Remember when I had that thing
with my African drumming teacher?

443
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:13,041
I don't know. He just got really needy.

444
00:30:13,607 --> 00:30:15,882
But this one is the real thing.

445
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:20,406
Not a lot of people know about him yet.
It's up to me to get his message out there.

446
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:23,126
LEXl: Anyway, he's gonna be
bigger than Deepak Chopra.

447
00:30:23,207 --> 00:30:25,482
Ramu is the guru of sex.

448
00:30:26,967 --> 00:30:30,437
(Sensual hip-hop music)

449
00:30:40,887 --> 00:30:42,559
VIJAY: The guru of sex.

450
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:46,079
She really thinks
you can be as famous as Deepak Chopra?

451
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:47,680
Who is he? Does he dance?

452
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:50,918
No, he tells Americans
how to get rich and be happy.

453
00:30:51,007 --> 00:30:52,759
I thought they knew.

454
00:30:53,447 --> 00:30:56,598
-Have you even tried the Kama Sutra?
-No, have you?

455
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:58,040
A little.

456
00:30:58,647 --> 00:30:59,966
By myself.

457
00:31:01,487 --> 00:31:05,162
But, Vijay, I don't want to be a guru.
I want to be an actor.

458
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:08,797
Then act like a guru.
It's better than acting like a waiter.

459
00:31:09,287 --> 00:31:11,721
So, who writes the lines for Deepak Chopra?

460
00:31:11,807 --> 00:31:15,004
They're not lines.
He has a philosophy and shit.

461
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:18,324
These guru-types don't just
put on turbans and screw chicks.

462
00:31:18,407 --> 00:31:21,604
They say profound things
they've been thinking about for centuries.

463
00:31:21,687 --> 00:31:24,804
The point is the guy's made
a gazillion dollars.

464
00:31:24,927 --> 00:31:26,679
A gazillion dollars?

465

What's that in rupees?

466
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:30,641
I don't think they have that many.

00:31:57,327 --> 00:31:58,760
Champagne?

476
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:01,355
I hope you don't mind.
I invited Amy to join us.

477
00:32:01,447 --> 00:32:02,846
She's a journalist.

478
00:32:02,927 --> 00:32:05,521
A journalist? No.

479
00:32:10,207 --> 00:32:14,485
So, as the son of the Maharajah,
when did you have your epiphany?

480
00:32:16,487 --> 00:32:18,045
When I was 15.

481
00:32:18,287 --> 00:32:19,800
Tell us everything.

482
00:32:19,887 --> 00:32:23,004
It was: I'll touch yours, you touch mine.

483
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:24,646
No big deal.

484
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:34,278
Do you know who or what you were
in any of your previous incarnations?

485
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:37,475
Dessert?

486
00:32:38,887 --> 00:32:40,366
AMY: That's me.

487
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:43,245
I wa.s hoping to schedule a. scrub.

488
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:46,239
It seems like you're holding back,
just a little.

489
00:32:46,327 --> 00:32:48,921
What you said at my party was
so much more powerful.

490
00:32:49,007 --> 00:32:51,282
God, rosebud, the naked costume,
and all that.

491
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:52,436
Right.

492
00:32:52,527 --> 00:32:55,087
You know, Lexi,
maybe I'm not the one to do all this.

493
00:32:56,287 --> 00:32:57,276
Wow.

494
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:02,639
Alexandra, hi.

495
00:33:03,487 --> 00:33:06,001
-How's your mother?
-Remarkably lifelike.

496
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:07,725
Guru Ramu, Kitty.

497
00:33:07,927 --> 00:33:09,042
Guru?

498
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:11,881
-Does he do privates?
-Does he ever.

499
00:33:11,967 --> 00:33:13,525
-Tuesday?
-Perfect.

500
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:15,165
-Heaven.
-Cia.o.

501
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:18,918
You do privates, right?

502
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:24,083
You'll get a call-back. Adios, Waldo.

503
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:25,919
-Great job today.
-Thanks.

504
00:33:28,447 --> 00:33:31,962
-Hi. It's me. Rammy.
-Hello.

505
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:35,319
I just wanted to apologise
for what happened on the set.

506
00:33:35,407 --> 00:33:36,806
I got paid.

507
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:38,839
RAMU: Excuse me, sir.
MAN: Watch it, pal.

508
00:33:38,927 --> 00:33:40,360
RAMU: I'm so sorry.

509
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,525
RAMU: I'm so sorry. Pardon me.

510
00:33:45,127 --> 00:33:46,845
Excuse me, ma'am.

511
00:33:47,927 --> 00:33:49,326
Hello, again.

512
00:33:49,647 --> 00:33:51,399
So now you're stalking me?

513
00:33:51,927 --> 00:33:54,839
No, I was hoping perhaps
I could buy you a cup of tea?

514
00:33:54,927 --> 00:33:56,599
I don't do that.

515
00:33:57,007 --> 00:33:58,281
Perhaps coffee then.

516
00:33:58,367 --> 00:34:01,325
Look, Rammy,
I'm engaged to a nice, normal guy.

517
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:05,122
Do you know how hard it is
to find a nice, normal guy in the city?

518
00:34:05,207 --> 00:34:06,196
Right?

519
00:34:06,287 --> 00:34:08,721
I just want your help
with a professional problem.

520
00:34:08,807 --> 00:34:12,243
Would you stop worrying about it?
A lot of guys can't get it up.

521
00:34:14,687 --> 00:34:16,006
You don't understand.

522
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,840
People are telling me
I could be the next Deepak Chopra.

523
00:34:18,927 --> 00:34:21,236
Well, I'm not familiar with Deep-Pack.

524
00:34:21,487 --> 00:34:24,718
I don't watch dirty movies
because my fiancé's kinda religious.

525
00:34:24,807 --> 00:34:27,924
No, I have an opportunity
to make a lot of money.

526
00:34:28,007 --> 00:34:31,477
Duh! Why do you think I got into
this business, 'cause it was interesting?

527
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:34,445
In three years I saved enough
to buy a house in Throg's Neck...

528
00:34:34,527 --> 00:34:36,802
and pay for my whole wedding.
Mulberry Street.

529
00:34:36,887 --> 00:34:39,117
Do you want to see the cake?

530
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:40,642
Gra.zie, cia.o.

531
00:34:40,727 --> 00:34:43,002
SHARRONA: Hi, I'm Sherri, I called earlier.
Are you Tony?

532
00:34:43,087 --> 00:34:44,805
Yeah, I got everything over there.

533
00:34:50,927 --> 00:34:52,360
SHARRONA: That's--
TONY: Expensive.

534
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:54,879
TONY: It's $800.

535
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:59,443
You see this one?
This is more in your price range.

536
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,362
-That's very nice, too.
-Yeah.

537
00:35:05,527 --> 00:35:07,722
Actually, sir, we will order this one.

538
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:10,685
-I want my lovely bride to be happy.
-Rammy, no.

539
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:13,918
TONY: Now, you two kids
discuss it amongst yourselves, okay?

540
00:35:14,007 --> 00:35:16,396
Rammy, $800 is too much.
I can't accept that.

541
00:35:16,487 --> 00:35:18,045
Look, it's not a gift.

542
00:35:18,127 --> 00:35:22,279
I want you to be my teacher
and I'm happy to pay for this privilege.

543
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:27,245
(Mandolin strumming wedding song)

544
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:28,922
Okay.

545
00:35:32,607 --> 00:35:36,486
(Upbeat instrumental music)

546
00:35:47,327 --> 00:35:48,806
(Doorbell rings)

547
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:55,165
Yeah, come on in.

548
00:35:55,967 --> 00:35:58,356
If this is a bad time I could come back later.

549
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,926
What am I doing here?

550
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:01,918
-Isn't this your apartment?
-What?

551
00:36:02,007 --> 00:36:03,360
Yes, this is my apartment.

552
00:36:03,447 --> 00:36:06,007
I mean, what am I doing
letting you into my apartment?

553
00:36:06,087 --> 00:36:08,043
-The other day--
-Rusty, my boyfriend...

554
00:36:08,127 --> 00:36:10,721
doesn't know about my X-rated job
in the real world.

555
00:36:10,807 --> 00:36:14,197
He thinks that I'm a PG-13 girl.
That I'm a nice, normal girl.

556
00:36:14,287 --> 00:36:15,879
-Well, you are.
-What?

557
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:17,719
A nice, normal girl.

558
00:36:18,287 --> 00:36:19,720
You think so?

559
00:36:22,127 --> 00:36:24,322
Wait a second. Do not flirt with me.

560
00:36:24,407 --> 00:36:26,796
Do not. That is rule number one.

561
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:29,557
Okay? And no little gifts either.

562
00:36:29,847 --> 00:36:30,996
SHARRONA: Rule number two:

563
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:34,079
You don't try to hit on me
or take advantage of any situation...

564
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:37,557
that you might find a turn-on.
Do you understand? This is just a lesson.

565
00:36:37,647 --> 00:36:40,207
-I am a teacher and you are the student.
-Of course.

566
00:36:40,287 --> 00:36:41,959
So, no touchy-feely.

567
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:44,117
If you touchy-feely me, I will hurt you.

568
00:36:44,207 --> 00:36:46,926
I will cause you pain.
I know the art of karate.

569
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:49,442
Okay.

570
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:53,920
Okay, rule number three: lf we're gonna
do this, you have to promise me...

571
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:57,317
that everything I say stays in this room.
You can't tell anyone.

572
00:36:57,407 --> 00:37:00,126
-Not a single soul.
-No, you see, you don't understand--

573
00:37:00,207 --> 00:37:01,799
Then you can leave right now.

574
00:37:08,207 --> 00:37:09,686
But of course.

575
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:12,723
Okay. Let's get started.

576
00:37:17,047 --> 00:37:20,278
So the other day, what happened?
Why did you lose it?

577
00:37:20,927 --> 00:37:22,360
I was afraid.

578
00:37:23,127 --> 00:37:26,722
There were 20 people around,
many drinking coffee, watching me.

579
00:37:26,807 --> 00:37:28,320
Exactly. Fear.

580
00:37:28,727 --> 00:37:30,877
Fear is cold. It freezes us up.

581
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:32,320
Fear of performance.

582
00:37:32,407 --> 00:37:35,479
Fear of doing something bad,
something dirty.

583
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:38,035
SHARRONA: What would our parents think?
What do we think?

584
00:37:38,127 --> 00:37:40,118
Do you know where we hold our fears?

585
00:37:40,207 --> 00:37:41,435
Up here.

586
00:37:41,647 --> 00:37:43,126
Further south.

587
00:37:43,247 --> 00:37:45,761
That's why sex is such a release.

588
00:37:50,047 --> 00:37:52,800
When we come, we let go of our fears.

589
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:56,163
And when we let go of our fears,
we touch our soul.

590
00:37:57,127 --> 00:37:58,958
So the way I look at it is...

591
00:37:59,407 --> 00:38:02,240
my pussy is the door to my soul.

592
00:38:04,287 --> 00:38:05,402
(Mystical sitar music)

593
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:08,883
Why are you afraid, Kitty?

594
00:38:09,327 --> 00:38:11,238
Well, what makes you think I'm afraid?

595
00:38:13,687 --> 00:38:15,006
I feel it.

596
00:38:16,447 --> 00:38:18,403
RAMU: Please, close your eyes.

597
00:38:21,687 --> 00:38:23,518
We have so many fears.

598
00:38:24,687 --> 00:38:26,484
"Fear of performance.

599
00:38:27,447 --> 00:38:29,597
"Fear of doing something bad."

600
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:33,076
Fear of what people will think.

601
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:34,846
Yes.

602
00:38:37,447 --> 00:38:40,405
Do you know where we hold our fears?

603
00:38:41,407 --> 00:38:45,241
Between our eyebrows
where we get those yucky little lines?

604
00:38:47,287 --> 00:38:48,879
In our genitals.

605
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:52,560
That is why sex is such a release.

606
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:55,801
When we come, we let go of our fears...

607
00:38:56,607 --> 00:38:59,997
and when you let go of your fears,
you touch your soul.

608
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:06,400
Your pussy is the door to your soul.

609
00:39:10,607 --> 00:39:13,599
KITTY: So, if I touch myself here...

610
00:39:14,367 --> 00:39:15,516
Kitty?

611
00:39:16,847 --> 00:39:18,644
...l won't be afraid?

612
00:39:24,847 --> 00:39:27,361
Excuse me. How much do I owe you?

613
00:39:27,887 --> 00:39:29,366
What you wish.

614
00:39:29,687 --> 00:39:33,680
I'm sorry. I need to be by myself.

615
00:39:36,527 --> 00:39:38,757
Lexi, he is beyond insightful.

616
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:40,880
KITTY: I have to go.

617
00:39:41,007 --> 00:39:43,999
KITTY: Thank you.
RAMU: You're welcome. Nice to meet you.

618
00:39:44,807 --> 00:39:46,638
RAMU: Wow. She paid me.

619
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,000
You're incredible.

620
00:39:50,247 --> 00:39:53,603
Kitty's such an unhappy person
and you helped her so much.

621
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:56,999
Just think, there are so many
unhappy people out there.

622
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:58,919
I know most of them.

623
00:39:59,327 --> 00:40:02,683
LEXl: But we can help them together.
I really want to do that. I've never...

624
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,678
really done anything, you know.

625
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:06,803
Can we do that? Can we...

626
00:40:07,487 --> 00:40:08,920
help mankind?

627
00:40:09,247 --> 00:40:11,238
I really want to help mankind.

628
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,482
Cool.

629
00:40:15,687 --> 00:40:17,405
VIJAY: $2,000!

630
00:40:19,847 --> 00:40:21,803
It's bloody incredible.

631
00:40:22,647 --> 00:40:25,366
But it's not my wisdom, it's Sharrona's.

632
00:40:25,447 --> 00:40:28,359
She thinks she gives me lessons
to be in porno movies...

633
00:40:28,447 --> 00:40:30,597
and she made me promise
not to tell anyone.

634
00:40:30,687 --> 00:40:32,484
-Great.
-Vij, be serious.

635
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:33,920
I am, ya.a.r.

636
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:36,917
Get her wisdom and use it.

637
00:40:37,687 --> 00:40:40,042
-Don't you want to be a star?
-Well, yes--

638
00:40:40,127 --> 00:40:43,483
How do you think that's going to happen
if you're not a guru?

639
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:45,876
Name one lndian star in America.

640
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:47,441
Name one.

641
00:40:47,887 --> 00:40:49,605
That guy from The Simpsons.

642
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:51,320
He's a cartoon.

643
00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:55,925
Don't you guys have to be at the restaurant?

644
00:40:56,207 --> 00:40:58,004
Ramu's got a new job.

645
00:40:58,487 --> 00:41:00,523
You gonna be a cab driver?

646
00:41:03,047 --> 00:41:06,005
No, I'm going to be a guru.

647
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:09,920
Cheers, Guruji.

648
00:41:10,007 --> 00:41:13,477
(Upbeat soul music)

649
00:41:18,527 --> 00:41:19,596
Vij!

650
00:41:24,127 --> 00:41:27,517
Come on, you want to get comfortable
in your naked costume, don't you?

651
00:41:27,607 --> 00:41:29,837
You need to be comfortable
with your own body.

652
00:41:29,927 --> 00:41:32,043
Okey-dokey pokey.

653
00:41:33,727 --> 00:41:34,796
Great.

654
00:41:35,687 --> 00:41:37,086
Your nakedness.

655
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:38,600
SHARRONA: Sa.y tha.t five times.

656
00:41:38,687 --> 00:41:40,359
I'm a good lover.

657
00:41:41,927 --> 00:41:44,725
-And again.
-I'm a good lover.

658
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,724
I deserve pleasure.

659
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:58,122
Budweiser: The Ma.ha.ra.j of beer.

660
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:04,602
Next.

661
00:42:07,127 --> 00:42:09,960
You two are gonna have
a wonderful weekend.

662
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:19,115
CLIENT: I'm a good lover.
RAMU: Thank you. That was very good.

663
00:42:19,207 --> 00:42:20,640
That was very good. Stop.

664
00:42:26,727 --> 00:42:31,039
Guru, my brother golfs
with the maharajah of Jaipur, Bubbles.

665
00:42:31,127 --> 00:42:33,641
And he says he's never heard of you.

666
00:42:34,447 --> 00:42:36,199
Well, it's a big country.

667
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:38,960
LEXl: Gurus shun the life of wealth
and materialism.

668
00:42:39,047 --> 00:42:41,561
Swami Muktananda said
everything in the universe...

669
00:42:41,647 --> 00:42:43,319
is made of divine consciousness...

670
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:46,843
and its innermost form dwells
in the centre of us all.

671
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:51,437
Wow, that's good.

672
00:42:58,927 --> 00:43:01,395
Lexi, can I see you in the kitchen?

673
00:43:02,767 --> 00:43:04,723
Do you know where it is?

674
00:43:12,407 --> 00:43:13,760
So, Guru...

675
00:43:14,287 --> 00:43:17,438
what would you tell a couple
that has hit a wall?

676
00:43:18,127 --> 00:43:19,799
"Are you all right?

677
00:43:19,887 --> 00:43:21,878
"Can I get you a doctor?"

678
00:43:27,207 --> 00:43:29,357
CHANTAL: What in heaven's name
are you doing?

679
00:43:29,447 --> 00:43:32,962
Being happy for a change.
Freely expressing my sexuality.

680
00:43:33,047 --> 00:43:36,403
You are sucking face
with your yoga instructor.

681
00:43:36,487 --> 00:43:39,047
He's not my yoga instructor.
And so what if I am?

682
00:43:39,127 --> 00:43:40,355
Darling...

683
00:43:40,447 --> 00:43:42,403
we don't date the help.

684
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:45,645
Remember what happened
with Aunt Eujanie and that U.P.S. man?

685
00:43:45,727 --> 00:43:48,764
News flash, Mother,
all people of colour aren't here to serve you.

686
00:43:48,847 --> 00:43:52,522
How dare you say that!
I have served meals to the homeless.

687
00:43:52,607 --> 00:43:55,804
Good meals. Things I'd eat myself,
if I still ate carbs.

688
00:43:55,887 --> 00:43:59,436
At any rate, you are making our guests
feel very uncomfortable.

689
00:43:59,527 --> 00:44:01,279
They'll get over it.

690
00:44:02,967 --> 00:44:05,003
MALE GUEST: You're drinking too much.

691
00:44:07,527 --> 00:44:09,483
Darling, come join.

692
00:44:10,207 --> 00:44:11,276
Hi.

693
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:13,956
MALE GUEST: Yes.
RAMU: Thank you very much.

694
00:44:15,047 --> 00:44:18,164
SHARRONA: Can you feel it in your mouth?
Can you taste it?

695
00:44:18,807 --> 00:44:20,525
The taste is sweet.

696
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:22,919
The taste is....

697
00:44:23,967 --> 00:44:25,719
Mint chocolate chip.

698
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,636
Okay, you can open your eyes now.

699
00:44:29,727 --> 00:44:33,481
I got that from an acting class.
It helps when you don't click with someone.

700
00:44:33,567 --> 00:44:35,558
Remember tha.t we ha.ve five senses...

701
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:38,286
and using them can make anything sexy.

702
00:44:39,727 --> 00:44:42,719
So, why do you do these movies?

703
00:44:45,607 --> 00:44:49,725
If you're having doubts about the business
then you should quit now. Trust me.

704
00:44:55,287 --> 00:44:56,925
You like to cook.

705
00:44:57,927 --> 00:45:00,521
In lndia, we call that a homely girl.

706
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:04,001
You know, a girl who likes
to do things in the home.

707
00:45:04,087 --> 00:45:06,317
Yeah, that's me, homely girl.

708
00:45:07,007 --> 00:45:08,406
Can I taste?

709
00:45:21,887 --> 00:45:24,765
Cinnamon? Hey, that's lamb stew.

710
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,917
Yeah, so? It has no flavour.

711
00:45:27,647 --> 00:45:29,000
Come on...

712
00:45:29,367 --> 00:45:30,516
taste.

713
00:45:37,967 --> 00:45:39,958
Are you flirting with me?

714
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,715
No. No.

715
00:45:44,207 --> 00:45:45,401
Got you.

716
00:45:46,287 --> 00:45:48,596
Don't take everything so seriously.

717
00:45:48,687 --> 00:45:51,326
-All right, that's it for today.
-Okay.

718
00:45:52,927 --> 00:45:54,519
And, Rammy...

719
00:45:54,687 --> 00:45:56,962
I use mint chocolate chip, too.

720
00:46:08,607 --> 00:46:10,325
Edwin, is that you?

721
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:15,924
What's wrong? You haven't been up here
since the Reagan administration.

722
00:46:22,007 --> 00:46:23,520
It's Bush time.

723
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,284
(Edwin growls)

724
00:46:34,207 --> 00:46:37,040
And tell Josh that a lot of agents
want to sign him.

725
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,242
Lexi.

726
00:46:38,887 --> 00:46:41,765
We met at Dr. Sid's retreat
for neurotic compulsives.

727
00:46:41,847 --> 00:46:43,803
I'm not supposed to say that.

728
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:46,959
Lexi who wouldn't go
to the Oscars with him. Don't say that.

729
00:46:47,047 --> 00:46:50,357
Just tell him Lexi, okay?
He'll know who I am. Cia.o.

730
00:46:52,607 --> 00:46:56,043
-Get up, we have the trainer at 10:00 a.m.
-10:00 a.m.?

731
00:46:57,127 --> 00:46:59,846
I have to go. I have an appointment.

732
00:46:59,927 --> 00:47:03,044
But I planned my day around you.
I was going to buy you sweaters.

733
00:47:03,127 --> 00:47:06,085
I'm sorry, Lexi, but I have my own life, too.

734
00:47:06,727 --> 00:47:10,766
You can't do this to me.
You can't just go and not tell me where.

735
00:47:12,727 --> 00:47:13,796
Guru!

736
00:47:14,807 --> 00:47:16,843
LEXI (Shouts): I have abandonment issues!

737
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:22,199
Okay, now I'm going to tell you something
I've never told anyone...

738
00:47:22,287 --> 00:47:24,323
but it's helped me more than anything.

739
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:26,523
I can't even believe I'm telling you this.

740
00:47:26,607 --> 00:47:29,997
-You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
-No, I want to.

741
00:47:30,087 --> 00:47:31,839
Okay, one of the biggest problems...

742
00:47:31,927 --> 00:47:34,919
is making something mechanical
look romantic.

743
00:47:35,007 --> 00:47:36,725
So music can help.

744
00:47:36,967 --> 00:47:38,923
-I love music.
-Me, too.

745
00:47:39,247 --> 00:47:43,399
What I do is, I hear and I feel the music...

746
00:47:43,887 --> 00:47:45,240
in my body.

747
00:47:46,567 --> 00:47:47,920
What music?

748
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:51,159
Songs, romantic songs. Like, I let it sing...

749
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:53,756
and then the rest of me follows.

750
00:47:55,007 --> 00:47:57,123
I'll show you. Name a song.

751
00:47:58,127 --> 00:47:59,401
La. Ba.mba..

752
00:48:01,487 --> 00:48:04,081
(Sharrona sings softly)

753
00:48:05,327 --> 00:48:10,196
That doesn't work. It has to be romantic.
It has to send love through your loins.

754
00:48:15,967 --> 00:48:18,800
Don't go cha.nging

755
00:48:19,127 --> 00:48:22,278
to try a.nd plea.se me

756
00:48:23,487 --> 00:48:28,038
You never let me down before

757
00:48:28,127 --> 00:48:32,006
(Sharrona humming melody and moaning)

758
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:34,522
Did you see what I was doing?

759
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,442
Yeah.

760
00:48:36,527 --> 00:48:40,042
It's like, on certain words
the passion comes through my body.

761
00:48:40,127 --> 00:48:43,642
It's like I can actually feel
Billy Joel between my legs.

762
00:48:43,727 --> 00:48:45,877
Not Billy Joel the person...

763
00:48:46,607 --> 00:48:50,282
but the romance, the sweetness,
the intention of his words.

764
00:48:50,647 --> 00:48:52,205
Now you try it.

765
00:48:57,047 --> 00:48:59,561
Don't go cha.nging

766
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:01,925
to try a.nd plea.se me

767
00:49:02,007 --> 00:49:04,441
Don't try to make a point,
try to touch your soul.

768
00:49:04,527 --> 00:49:06,279
I'll do it with you.

769
00:49:07,207 --> 00:49:12,327
You never let me down before

770
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:15,877
(Sing in unison)

771
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:19,281
I don't ima.gine

772
00:49:19,807 --> 00:49:22,241
you're too fa.milia.r

773
00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:25,759
Why don't you get on top of me?
It's the only way you'll learn.

774
00:49:25,847 --> 00:49:26,996
What?

775
00:49:27,087 --> 00:49:30,557
(Soft instrumental melody)

776
00:49:32,367 --> 00:49:33,516
Sorry.

777
00:49:38,207 --> 00:49:40,641
Don't go trying

778
00:49:41,127 --> 00:49:43,960
some new fa.shion

779
00:49:44,767 --> 00:49:49,682
Don't cha.nge the colour ofyour ha.ir

780
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:53,443
(Upbeat instrumental music)

781
00:49:57,767 --> 00:50:00,520
I don't wa.nt clever

782
00:50:02,487 --> 00:50:05,399
conversa.tion

783
00:50:06,167 --> 00:50:11,195
I never wa.nt to work tha.t ha.rd

784
00:50:16,367 --> 00:50:19,279
Ijust wa.nt someone

785
00:50:20,527 --> 00:50:22,961
I ca.n ta.Ik to

786
00:50:24,527 --> 00:50:29,317
I wa.nt youjust the wa.y you a.re

787
00:50:33,007 --> 00:50:35,475
(Upbeat instrumental music)

788
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,436
(Knock at the door)

789
00:50:37,527 --> 00:50:40,917
RUSTY: Shar?
SHARRONA: Oh, my God, that's Rusty. Hide.

790
00:50:43,527 --> 00:50:45,006
Shar, open up.

791
00:50:49,767 --> 00:50:50,882
Shit.

792
00:50:53,607 --> 00:50:54,926
-Hey.
-What a surprise.

793
00:50:55,007 --> 00:50:55,996
I got off early.

794
00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:59,602
Randy and I were going to the gym,
but he had O.T. I gotta take a leak.

795
00:50:59,687 --> 00:51:02,076
SHARRONA: Don't! I mean, are you sure?
RUSTY: Oh, God.

796
00:51:02,167 --> 00:51:04,806
Do you want something to eat, or a beer?

797
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:06,916
What the....

798
00:51:07,007 --> 00:51:09,999
Ma'am, that leak shouldn't cause
any more trouble.

799
00:51:10,087 --> 00:51:14,319
I've readjusted the pipe connection,
and hooked it up to the main artery.

800
00:51:14,407 --> 00:51:16,875
-I'm the plumber.
-I should hope so.

801
00:51:22,687 --> 00:51:25,838
You are the big, strong
American boyfriend, huh?

802
00:51:26,367 --> 00:51:27,686
I guess I am, yeah.

803
00:51:27,767 --> 00:51:31,282
But you couldn't fix
the pipe connection now, could you?

804
00:51:35,287 --> 00:51:39,075
-How come he didn't have any tools?
-He's a holistic plumber.

805
00:51:42,647 --> 00:51:46,117
SHARRONA: Ca.Iculus isn't my only
a.dva.nced skill, Professor Wa.nk.

806
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,837
How do you like them a.pples?

807
00:51:55,207 --> 00:51:58,199
-What are you watching?
-My Sha.rona..

808
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:03,360
-You bastards! Turn it off!
-What? You've seen Good Will Humping?

809
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:07,275
We also have Sta.r Whores.: Episode 69,
and Cha.rlie's Anus.

810
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:08,846
(Moaning from TV)

811
00:52:09,047 --> 00:52:10,719
SHARRONA: It's not my fa.ult.

812
00:52:11,687 --> 00:52:13,359
It's not my fa.ult.

813
00:52:13,447 --> 00:52:15,722
You couldn't get it up for her?

814
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:21,082
-You try having sex with 20 people around.
-I've never had sex without 20 people.

815
00:52:23,927 --> 00:52:26,600
Now, I don't want you to watch that again.

816
00:52:26,687 --> 00:52:30,646
She's a real person, and my friend,
and she's a lot smarter than you guys.

817
00:52:30,727 --> 00:52:33,799
Oh, I see a young man. He is in love.

818
00:52:34,207 --> 00:52:37,916
-He's in love with a buxom schoolgirl.
-Piss off, man!

819
00:52:39,687 --> 00:52:41,040
All right.

820
00:52:41,647 --> 00:52:44,639
All right, what's got your turban in a twist?

821
00:52:46,687 --> 00:52:48,120
I don't know.

822
00:52:49,647 --> 00:52:52,798
Desi Fantasy Hotline.

SHARRONA: ls Ra.mmy there? It's Sha.rrona..

824
00:52:57,687 --> 00:52:58,961
Sharrona.

825
00:53:00,087 --> 00:53:01,122
Hi.

826
00:53:01,927 --> 00:53:03,406
RAMU: Give it to me.

827
00:53:07,287 --> 00:53:09,721
I talked to a real live porn star.

828
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,523
I think she sounded naked.

829
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:16,000
RAMU: Hey, how's it going?
SHARRONA: I got you a.job.

830
00:53:16,767 --> 00:53:20,442
Dwain said that you could be an extra
on the gladiator movie tomorrow.

831
00:53:20,527 --> 00:53:23,280
What? I mean, what?

832
00:53:23,487 --> 00:53:25,318
SHARRONA: You wa.nt to be in films, right?

833
00:53:25,407 --> 00:53:26,806
I do.

834
00:53:27,767 --> 00:53:30,600
Well, this is what we've been working for.

835
00:53:30,767 --> 00:53:31,916
SHARRONA: Ra.mmy?

836
00:53:32,367 --> 00:53:35,803
RAMU: I don't have to do it, do l?
SANJIV: I'll do it.

837
00:53:36,887 --> 00:53:38,240
I'll do it!

838
00:53:38,767 --> 00:53:43,363
SHARRONA: You don't ha.ve to do a.nything.
It's extra. work. Remember, fea.r freezes.

839
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:46,041
See you.

840
00:53:46,447 --> 00:53:47,641
See you.

841
00:53:48,727 --> 00:53:51,799
SANJIV: Did you tell her I'll do it? Did you?

842
00:53:52,407 --> 00:53:54,557
DWAIN: All right, gladiator love slaves...

843
00:53:54,647 --> 00:53:57,286
a little more thrashing.
I want to feel your pain.

844
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,005
Gla.d He Ate Her...

845
00:53:59,087 --> 00:54:01,601
scene 21, take six.

846
00:54:02,207 --> 00:54:03,640
And, action.

847
00:54:05,447 --> 00:54:08,996
Which one of you worthless love slaves
will dare--

848
00:54:09,087 --> 00:54:10,202
DWAIN: Cut!

849
00:54:11,087 --> 00:54:14,363
Can we get some oil for these guys?
I'm seeing chalky legs here.

850
00:54:14,447 --> 00:54:17,757
-How are you hanging in there, Rammy?
-From a chain.

851
00:54:18,247 --> 00:54:19,726
(Cell phone ringing)

852
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,076
Hello.

853
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:28,159
Guru, where are you?
I'm here at Josh Goldstein's office.

854
00:54:28,247 --> 00:54:31,842
Right, the agent.
I've been detained out here.

855
00:54:32,047 --> 00:54:33,196
Where's "out here"?

856
00:54:33,287 --> 00:54:35,403
ANNOUNCER:
Puerto Rica.n Lea.ther Queens to sta.ge two.

857
00:54:35,487 --> 00:54:36,476
Queens.

858
00:54:37,687 --> 00:54:38,881
LEXl: Queens?

859
00:54:39,087 --> 00:54:41,965
Do you know how important this is?
The access Josh Goldstein has?

860
00:54:42,047 --> 00:54:44,163
He can help us get our message out there.

861
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:47,762
-I'll be right there, I promise. Don't worry.
-Hurry up!

862
00:54:51,487 --> 00:54:53,079
Lying to your girlfriend?

863
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:54,919
Who said that was my girlfriend?

864
00:54:55,007 --> 00:54:56,486
Is she pretty?

865
00:54:57,607 --> 00:54:59,279
CAMERAMAN: Places, please.

866
00:55:03,007 --> 00:55:06,079
-Your guy's not here?
-He's coming. He had a thing, got tied up.

867
00:55:06,167 --> 00:55:07,964
He got tied up? You--

868
00:55:10,487 --> 00:55:14,400
Which one of you worthless love slaves
will dare to enter my love ring?

869
00:55:14,487 --> 00:55:15,556
Cut!

870
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:17,841
All right, good work.

871
00:55:17,927 --> 00:55:20,236
Grea.t work.

872
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:25,679
-It was a lot to memorise.
-Yeah, well, not so much talk this time.

873
00:55:27,447 --> 00:55:29,403
Excuse me, I have to get my clothes and go.

874
00:55:29,687 --> 00:55:31,757
No one leaves till we wrap.

875
00:55:35,687 --> 00:55:37,040
What's up?

876
00:55:47,807 --> 00:55:51,356
-"Ramew Gouda."
-Hey, you made it. I'm so psyched for this.

877
00:55:51,447 --> 00:55:53,961
-Josh, Ramu.
-It's nice to meet you.

878
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,517
-May I take your coat?
-No, I'm fine.

879
00:55:56,607 --> 00:55:59,201
Oh, no, please, I'll just hang it....

880
00:56:02,687 --> 00:56:04,917
I was at a past life workshop.

881
00:56:06,127 --> 00:56:09,358
Really? Did you see me?
I worked in the mailroom.

882
00:56:09,447 --> 00:56:12,200
Just kidding. Why don't you have a seat?

883
00:56:19,207 --> 00:56:21,721
Lexi tells me you have quite the following.

884
00:56:21,807 --> 00:56:23,877
I'm just gonna jump right in, okay?

885
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:28,722
The goal here is to separate you
from all the other self-help spiritual types...

886
00:56:28,807 --> 00:56:32,766
so you're not just another lndian,
or, excuse me, Native American.

887
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:36,920
What you've got going for you is God.
And by the way, God is big.

888
00:56:37,007 --> 00:56:40,761
You mention God, people pay attention.
God demands attention, and....

889
00:56:40,847 --> 00:56:43,645
What can I say?
We want to be in bed with God.

890
00:56:43,727 --> 00:56:47,640
But what do people want to pay attention to
more than anything else?

891
00:56:47,727 --> 00:56:51,356
Sex. You let people think about both,
which is brilliant.

892
00:56:51,607 --> 00:56:53,757
Josh is one of the smartest agents in town.

893
00:56:53,847 --> 00:56:56,759
We can handle your book deals in London,
website in Munich...

894
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:59,077
-your television in New York.
-Television?

895
00:56:59,167 --> 00:57:01,761
-That's right. Movie deals in Hollywood.
-Hollywood?

896
00:57:01,847 --> 00:57:02,962
JOSH: Sure.

897
00:57:03,327 --> 00:57:06,797
Step one, you gotta expand
your core audience. How do we do that?

898
00:57:06,887 --> 00:57:09,799
I think we do a big show,
a couple thousand people.

899
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:12,720
-Maybe we book a Broadway house.
-Broadway?

900
00:57:12,807 --> 00:57:16,641
That's right:
"The Guru of Sex." One night only.

901
00:57:16,727 --> 00:57:19,116
You gotta keep them wanting more.

902
00:57:19,287 --> 00:57:21,562
Hey, Ari, get me the Playhouse.

903
00:57:21,687 --> 00:57:24,281
And, by the way,
I'm not into micromanaging...

904
00:57:24,367 --> 00:57:26,961
but you're not going to wear that....

905
00:57:28,087 --> 00:57:30,521
What is it you're wearing, anyway?

906
00:57:33,007 --> 00:57:35,237
-I really like Josh.
-What's going on?

907
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:37,887
-What do you mean?
-You run to secret appointments...

908
00:57:37,967 --> 00:57:41,039
-to past life workshops with costumes.
-I'm sorry--

909
00:57:41,127 --> 00:57:44,085
You don't invite me,
when you know how much I love that stuff.

910
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:45,122
I couldn't, l--

911
00:57:45,207 --> 00:57:49,325
You'll be the Mother Teresa of sex.
I want to help you, and you leave me out.

912
00:57:49,407 --> 00:57:50,840
I don't understand that.

913
00:57:50,927 --> 00:57:53,487
No one can give you what you want.
It's too much.

914
00:57:53,567 --> 00:57:54,761
What are you saying?

915
00:57:54,847 --> 00:57:57,520
I'm saying live your own life, not mine.

916
00:57:57,607 --> 00:57:59,757
Follow your own dreams, not mine.

917
00:57:59,847 --> 00:58:04,557
There are many different paths.
You can go this way, or that way.

918
00:58:04,767 --> 00:58:08,601
But you must choose your own path.
It's your own damn journey.

919
00:58:12,767 --> 00:58:15,042
I'm going to meditate on that!

920
00:58:17,767 --> 00:58:18,882
Yeah.

921
00:58:22,607 --> 00:58:26,077
(Upbeat pop music)

922
00:58:48,807 --> 00:58:50,763
SANJIV: Hello. Thank you.

923
00:58:52,047 --> 00:58:53,366
'Bye. Ramu.

924
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,722
What more could a swami ask for?

925
00:59:05,047 --> 00:59:06,116
RAMU: Hey!

926
00:59:21,887 --> 00:59:23,605
-Hey.
-Hey.

927
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:26,885
-I got an idea for today's lesson, but--
-No.

928
00:59:27,287 --> 00:59:30,324
It's such a beautiful day. Let's take a walk.

929
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:31,882
Okay.

930
00:59:36,567 --> 00:59:37,886
After you.

931
00:59:40,287 --> 00:59:44,405
-So, I miss my na.nima. the most.
-Does your family like it you're in America?

932
00:59:44,487 --> 00:59:47,524
No, they'd rather I be married off with kids...

933
00:59:47,727 --> 00:59:49,922
holding down a nine-to-five salary.

934
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:52,726
But they're getting used to it.
They want me to be happy.

935
00:59:52,807 --> 00:59:56,846
You're lucky, 'cause the only family
I have right now is Dwain and Peaches.

936
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,485
They're quite a family.

937
00:59:58,567 --> 01:00:00,637
No, really, they saved my life.

938
01:00:00,727 --> 01:00:04,276
I don't even want to tell you
what I was doing before I met them.

939
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:07,120
They treat me right. I'm safe with them.

940
01:00:07,727 --> 01:00:09,399
Look, Sharrona...

941
01:00:10,127 --> 01:00:12,322
I have to tell you something.

942
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:13,716
Go on.

943
01:00:16,927 --> 01:00:18,918
This is really difficult.

944
01:00:19,167 --> 01:00:21,522
Let me tell you something first.

945
01:00:23,247 --> 01:00:27,320
I really like teaching you.
It makes me feel good to help someone.

946
01:00:28,247 --> 01:00:33,116
But I don't think you should do it.
You don't know what it's like. It's porn....

947
01:00:33,567 --> 01:00:36,001
I just don't think you should do it.

948
01:00:36,087 --> 01:00:38,317
You're so pure and good and....

949
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:41,441
You don't know what it's really like.

950
01:00:41,607 --> 01:00:45,077
That's why I made up all those ways
to get through it.

951
01:00:45,287 --> 01:00:48,916
Because I wanted to make it seem
like I was doing something else.

952
01:00:49,007 --> 01:00:53,478
-Something important and respectable.
-You are respectable.

953
01:00:54,367 --> 01:00:57,837
How can you say that?
Rusty doesn't even know what I do.

954
01:00:57,927 --> 01:01:00,566
If he did, he wouldn't marry me.

955
01:01:01,927 --> 01:01:03,679
But I'd marry you...

956
01:01:03,767 --> 01:01:06,964
(Tender instrumental music)

957
01:01:07,047 --> 01:01:08,446
...for 50 cows.

958
01:01:09,887 --> 01:01:12,685
SHARRONA: Only 50?
RAMU: Well, they're sacred you know.

959
01:01:13,407 --> 01:01:16,479
Okay, 100 sacred cows, and...

960
01:01:17,647 --> 01:01:21,117
Iet's see, a field full of buffalos...

961
01:01:22,407 --> 01:01:24,159
a dozen peacocks...

962
01:01:26,247 --> 01:01:30,081
and a herd of the most beautiful creatures
in all the world:

963
01:01:31,207 --> 01:01:33,437
A herd full of blue elephants.

964
01:01:33,687 --> 01:01:34,802
Blue?

965
01:01:36,207 --> 01:01:37,356
Blue.

966
01:01:52,047 --> 01:01:55,084
-I have to go.
-No, you don't have to do anything.

967
01:01:55,167 --> 01:01:57,442
Of course I do, silly. See you.

968
01:01:58,927 --> 01:02:02,397
(Melancholy instrumental music)

969
01:02:32,847 --> 01:02:35,122
RUSTY: But, hey, that's Randy for you.

970
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,801
MRS. MCGEE: He's so funny.
RUSTY: You always say that.

971
01:02:39,687 --> 01:02:41,439
To Sherri and Rusty.

972
01:02:43,447 --> 01:02:47,360
Russell tells me
you'll help teach the catechism class.

973
01:02:48,887 --> 01:02:50,684
Catechism. Neat.

974
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:54,279
FATHER: It's a blessing to have
a professional in charge at last.

975
01:02:54,367 --> 01:02:55,402
Hi, baby.

976
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,318
MR. MCGEE:
Father feels you're an amateur.

977
01:02:57,407 --> 01:02:58,442
Leave Mum alone.

978
01:02:58,527 --> 01:03:00,006
MR. MCGEE: I said no such thing.

979
01:03:00,087 --> 01:03:04,842
Tuesdays is knitting circle, and you will be
the first member of the millennium.

980
01:03:04,927 --> 01:03:06,758
I had to use all my influence.

981
01:03:06,847 --> 01:03:09,600
If it doesn't interfere
with couples' bowling, right, honey?

982
01:03:09,687 --> 01:03:12,565
You ever bowl with Rusty? It's a good thing.

983
01:03:12,647 --> 01:03:14,797
Throws the ball like a ballet dancer.

984
01:03:14,887 --> 01:03:16,240
RUSTY: Don't start, Dad.

985
01:03:16,327 --> 01:03:19,160
Tell me, my dear, have we not met before?

986
01:03:21,487 --> 01:03:23,682
Sweetie, have you met
Father Flanagan before?

987
01:03:23,767 --> 01:03:26,520
No, Father, I would have
remembered meeting you.

988
01:03:26,607 --> 01:03:29,405
Your lovely face looks so familiar to me.

989
01:03:29,487 --> 01:03:32,365
You don't believe me?
Watch and learn, tough guy.

990
01:03:32,447 --> 01:03:35,757
You're the chick from Sta.r Whores, right?
Episode 69?

991
01:03:35,847 --> 01:03:37,678
-Excuse me?
-No, that's not me.

992
01:03:37,767 --> 01:03:41,157
DRUNK GUY: No, it's you.
I saw that forwards and backwards.

993
01:03:41,247 --> 01:03:44,000
You're out of line. Sit down.
You're making a mistake.

994
01:03:44,087 --> 01:03:46,476
DRUNK GUY: It's her. Baby.
MRS. MCGEE: What's he doing?

995
01:03:46,567 --> 01:03:48,558
You know what? I'm sick of this.

996
01:03:48,647 --> 01:03:53,163
There must be some cheap porn star
out there that looks just like Sherri.

997
01:03:55,407 --> 01:03:57,602
-I'm sorry, honey.
-I'm feeling a bit sick--

998
01:03:57,687 --> 01:04:00,326
-Sweetheart, wait--
-I have to go home.

999
01:04:00,487 --> 01:04:01,636
Honey?

1000
01:04:02,647 --> 01:04:05,286
RUSTY: What did I say?
MRS. MCGEE: Pre-wedding jitters.

1001
01:04:19,527 --> 01:04:21,916
SHARRONA: Hello, is Rammy there?
AMIT: Ra.mu? No.

1002
01:04:22,007 --> 01:04:25,079
SHARRONA: Can you tell me where he is?
AMIT: The Broa.dwa.y Pla.yhouse.

1003
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:26,486
Thank you.

1004
01:04:27,727 --> 01:04:30,878
Now that you have an agent,
I think you need a manager.

1005
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:32,639
What do managers do?

1006
01:04:32,727 --> 01:04:34,319
Take 15 percent.

1007
01:04:36,807 --> 01:04:39,480
LEXl: Guru Ramu and friend.

1008
01:04:40,007 --> 01:04:41,599
Hey, Lex.

1009
01:04:42,247 --> 01:04:45,523
Well, hello. Vijay Rao, manager.

1010
01:04:46,767 --> 01:04:49,565
Guru, I've been meditating
on what you said...

1011
01:04:49,647 --> 01:04:53,765
and I think I understand
why you pulled back from our relationship.

1012
01:04:53,847 --> 01:04:55,075
I don't.

1013
01:04:55,367 --> 01:04:58,359
The reason you ignited
my kundalini energy in the first place...

1014
01:04:58,447 --> 01:05:01,120
was so I could move that sex force
into other chakras...

1015
01:05:01,207 --> 01:05:04,756
my heart, my mind,
maybe even some day, my third eye.

1016
01:05:05,127 --> 01:05:06,355
Exactly.

1017
01:05:07,047 --> 01:05:10,801
Yes, I knew it. I knew giving up the stuff
would help me focus.

1018
01:05:10,887 --> 01:05:12,843
-What stuff?
-Everything.

1019
01:05:12,927 --> 01:05:16,761
I'm moving to a studio apartment in Queens.

1020
01:05:17,327 --> 01:05:19,363
Will you be subleasing your penthouse?

1021
01:05:28,527 --> 01:05:31,678
CROWD (Singing): Don't go cha.nging

RAMU: Feel Billy Joel between your legs.

1024
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:42,446
RAMU: And then,
feel your genita.Is come a.Iive.

Don't cha.nge the colour ofyour ha.ir

RAMU: Tha.t's right.

01:06:05,247 --> 01:06:07,715
Send tha.t love through your loins.

1036
01:06:14,407 --> 01:06:17,001
RAMU: Let them sing.
CROWD: Although I might not seem to ca.re

1037
01:06:17,087 --> 01:06:18,884
RAMU: Let go ofyour fea.rs.

1038
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:21,558
Fea.r is cold.

CROWD (Singing): I don't wa.nt clever

1047
01:06:48,527 --> 01:06:51,360
Carry on,
the Guru's just gone to the restroom.

1048
01:06:51,447 --> 01:06:53,915
CROWD: I need to know

CROWD: The sa.me old someone tha.t I knew

1051
01:06:58,887 --> 01:07:00,445
VIJAY: Love your loins.

1052
01:07:00,527 --> 01:07:03,997
-I meant to tell you.
-You certainly had a deal, didn't you?

1053
01:07:04,087 --> 01:07:07,124
You pay me, steal my private thoughts,
and sell them to the world.

1054
01:07:07,207 --> 01:07:11,359
-I told you things I have never told anyone.
-I tried to tell you, I did.

1055
01:07:11,447 --> 01:07:15,406
And then I wanted your philosophy,
and then I wanted to see you.

1056
01:07:15,647 --> 01:07:18,286
That is why. I just wanted to see you.

1057
01:07:18,407 --> 01:07:22,195
You're sick, you know. And mean.
How could you lie like that?

1058
01:07:22,887 --> 01:07:25,924
You tell me, Mrs. Schoolteacher.
What about Rusty?

1059
01:07:26,007 --> 01:07:28,965
-You're lying to him and to yourself.
-That's not true!

1060
01:07:29,047 --> 01:07:33,199
You think no one will love you for you,
so you pretend to be someone else.

1061
01:07:33,287 --> 01:07:35,596
Don't you see? That is not real.

1062
01:07:35,927 --> 01:07:38,566
-What is that? Guru-speak?
-It's true.

1063
01:07:39,047 --> 01:07:42,119
Maybe I'm a bad person
who deserves to be stabbed in the heart...

1064
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:44,118
but I know you deserve more.

1065
01:07:44,207 --> 01:07:47,483
You're just a stupid con man.
Go steal those people's money...

1066
01:07:47,567 --> 01:07:50,923
before they realise
that you're just a big dumb fake!

1067
01:07:52,407 --> 01:07:55,046
I'm a fake? Well, then you're a super fake.

1068
01:07:55,127 --> 01:07:58,164
A porno star saying you're a teacher,
for a house in Frog's Neck!

1069
01:07:58,247 --> 01:08:00,522
Throg's Neck. I plan to be very happy there.

1070
01:08:00,607 --> 01:08:04,486
You better go steal those people's money
before your visa expires!

1071
01:08:04,567 --> 01:08:06,046
-Okay, I will!
-Taxi!

1072
01:08:06,127 --> 01:08:09,483
I'll be rich, and famous,
and very, very happy!

1073
01:08:09,567 --> 01:08:10,966
-Fine!
-Fine!

1074
01:08:11,167 --> 01:08:12,282
SHARRONA: Taxi!

1075
01:08:24,007 --> 01:08:26,237
VIJAY: Hello, girls, come on.

1076
01:08:26,327 --> 01:08:28,283
Rea.dy for some fun?

1077
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:30,643
This is Amit and Sanjiv.

1078
01:08:31,967 --> 01:08:34,959
This is Candy, Mindy,
Sandy, Daisy and Tasha.

1079
01:08:35,167 --> 01:08:36,316
I just....

1080
01:08:36,607 --> 01:08:37,881
(Speaking in Hindi)

1081
01:08:41,207 --> 01:08:43,402
SANJIV: Beautiful jungle top.

1082
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,122
SANJIV: You are a heartbreaker, baby.

1083
01:08:47,847 --> 01:08:50,645
The great thing about this place is
we never have to move.

1084
01:08:50,727 --> 01:08:52,957
They can carry us out of here in a box.

1085
01:08:53,047 --> 01:08:56,323
WOMAN: Anthony, I'm waiting for you!

1086
01:08:58,967 --> 01:09:03,085
VIJAY: All right! We got it.
Ten cents for every Guru of Sex T-shirt sold.

1087
01:09:03,247 --> 01:09:05,715
Maybe we could donate the proceeds.

1088
01:09:06,407 --> 01:09:07,806
Maybe. Not.

1089
01:09:08,807 --> 01:09:12,163
You know,
I'm sick of your fucking materialism!

1090
01:09:12,247 --> 01:09:16,525
I'm sick of your fucking scented oils.
You smell like a Bombay hooker.

Ramu, we've got the Cher party tonight.
Sa.Ily Jessy Ra.pha.el tomorrow.

1092
01:09:21,727 --> 01:09:23,763
Hey, man, did you hear me?

1093
01:09:24,047 --> 01:09:26,402
Did it ever occur to you
he might be meditating?

1094
01:09:26,487 --> 01:09:27,522
No.

1095
01:09:28,047 --> 01:09:30,515

VIJAY: Vijay Rao, the Guru's manager.

1098
01:09:38,287 --> 01:09:41,677
Hello, girls, a.Il right there.
Ra.mu's coming in there.

1099
01:09:41,767 --> 01:09:45,442
All right, then. Vija.y Ra.o, ma.na.ger.

1100
01:09:47,367 --> 01:09:49,801
RAMU: Hey, man.
SANJIV: Tony called.

1101
01:09:49,887 --> 01:09:51,479
-Tony who?
-I don't know.

1102
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:53,762
I don't have all the answers like you, Guruji.

1103
01:09:53,847 --> 01:09:56,441
He said your wedding cake will be ready
tomorrow 9:00 a.m.

1104
01:09:56,527 --> 01:09:58,836
Are you getting married tomorrow?

1105
01:09:58,927 --> 01:10:01,077
No, I'm not getting married tomorrow.

1106
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:03,317
I never know with you, ya.a.r.

1129
01:12:20,847 --> 01:12:21,916
MRS. MCGEE: I'll get it.

1130
01:12:22,007 --> 01:12:25,363
No, you go get your things together.
I'm double-parked.

1131
01:12:32,647 --> 01:12:34,239
Why did they send the cake here?

1132
01:12:34,327 --> 01:12:36,795
It's supposed to go to the reception hall.

1133
01:12:36,887 --> 01:12:38,320
I'm so sorry.

1134
01:12:39,007 --> 01:12:41,043
Just leave it right there.

1135
01:12:42,247 --> 01:12:46,365
She's just a nervous bride.
I'll get my purse. I won't be a jiffy.

1136
01:12:47,047 --> 01:12:50,084
It's terrible what I did to you. I know that.

1137
01:12:50,167 --> 01:12:52,237
But what you're about to do....

1138
01:12:52,327 --> 01:12:55,319
Don't go through with this.
You don't have to.

1139
01:12:55,607 --> 01:12:58,679
-You and me--
-There is no you and me. You used me.

1140
01:12:58,767 --> 01:13:01,600
And I used you, too.
And I did it for the cake.

1141
01:13:03,927 --> 01:13:07,203
Here you are, sir. Good-bye. And thank you.

1142
01:13:11,287 --> 01:13:13,039
All righty, then.

1143
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:22,436
(Both doors slam shut)

1144
01:13:29,647 --> 01:13:33,276
-Vij, I can't go in there.
-What the fuck you talking about?

1145
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:35,756
I know you love it.
The clothes and everything...

1146
01:13:35,847 --> 01:13:38,520
but it's not real. I can't do this anymore.

1147
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:40,160
You're serious.

1148
01:13:40,527 --> 01:13:42,882
But, Ram, you've made it. You're a star.

1149
01:13:42,967 --> 01:13:45,276
-I don't care.
-Of course you do.

1150
01:13:45,607 --> 01:13:47,882
Remember, ya.a.r, we came here with nothing.

1151
01:13:47,967 --> 01:13:51,164
And look at us now.
You've made it for all of us.

1152
01:13:54,247 --> 01:13:57,717
Think about your family,
how proud they'll be.

1153
01:14:00,487 --> 01:14:01,966
Come on, ya.a.r.

MAN: Hey, is that him?

1155
01:14:10,687 --> 01:14:11,836
WOMAN 1 : Oh, it's him.

1156
01:14:13,647 --> 01:14:14,477
WOMAN 2: It's Guru.

1157
01:14:14,567 --> 01:14:15,602
VIJAY: Right this way.

1158
01:14:15,687 --> 01:14:17,405
Okay, I'm your cousin Kimberly.

1159
01:14:17,487 --> 01:14:21,560
I'm a librarian, and I have five children,
all boys. I like that part.

1160
01:14:21,647 --> 01:14:24,719
And, I live in Utica.

1161
01:14:25,047 --> 01:14:27,561
Ithaca. You live in lthaca.

1162
01:14:28,887 --> 01:14:32,038
-And you run a Head Start program there.
-Okay. Head.

1163
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:36,523
-Head, I can remember that.
-I'm cutting the cake, not jumping out of it.

1164
01:14:36,607 --> 01:14:37,722
Okay.

(Sharrona starts sobbing)

1166
01:14:40,887 --> 01:14:43,959
Honey, what's wrong? Why are you crying?

1167
01:14:44,047 --> 01:14:45,480
(Sobs) I don't know.

1168
01:14:46,567 --> 01:14:48,046
Oh, honey.

1169
01:14:48,807 --> 01:14:51,799
SHARRONA (Sobs): They're just tears
of joy or something.

1170
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:55,323
Honey, no. No, the makeup.

1171
01:14:55,727 --> 01:14:57,206
Waldo Hernandez.

1172
01:14:57,287 --> 01:14:59,278
Waldo. And what do you do?

1173
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:02,356
I'm in the meat-packing industry.

1174
01:15:04,407 --> 01:15:05,442
Hi.

1175
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:09,884
Pretend I'm not here.

1176
01:15:10,687 --> 01:15:11,881
Marsha!

1177
01:15:14,167 --> 01:15:17,842
And now I'm happy to introduce
a true phenomenon...

1178
01:15:18,327 --> 01:15:21,956
the Guru of Sex, Ramu Gupta.

1179
01:15:22,047 --> 01:15:24,925
(Applause)

1180
01:15:31,807 --> 01:15:35,766
Ramu Gupta will be taking calls,
and he will be talking about...

1181
01:15:36,007 --> 01:15:39,761
well, what he talks about,
sexual intercourse.

1182
01:15:40,087 --> 01:15:42,647
Mama! Ramu's on Sa.Ily Jessy Ra.pha.el.

1183
01:15:43,447 --> 01:15:45,802
Well, first I'djust like to sa.y hi to my fa.mily.

1184
01:15:45,887 --> 01:15:46,842
Hi, Nanima.

1185
01:15:46,927 --> 01:15:48,246
He said hi to me.

1186
01:15:48,327 --> 01:15:49,396
What's he doing?

1187
01:15:49,487 --> 01:15:51,443
He's talking about sexual intercourse.

1188
01:15:51,527 --> 01:15:52,642
What?

1189
01:15:53,047 --> 01:15:55,356
EDWIN: Candy, make sure everything
is in tiptop shape.

1190
01:15:55,527 --> 01:15:59,645
Oh, yes. Mrs. Von Austerberg
is very demanding.

1191
01:15:59,727 --> 01:16:02,366
Yes, I know. So am l.

1192
01:16:04,247 --> 01:16:06,807
SALLY: Welcome ba.ck. The Guru of Sex...

1193
01:16:06,887 --> 01:16:08,639
-Ra.mu Gupta..
-Look, it's our guru.

1194
01:16:10,847 --> 01:16:13,805
SALLY: Our next question is from....
MAN: John.

1195
01:16:15,327 --> 01:16:17,761
Guru, my problem is
that the only way I've been...

1196
01:16:17,847 --> 01:16:19,803
able to get a woman is on the computer.

1197
01:16:21,767 --> 01:16:24,520
Well, John, don't limit yourself.

1198
01:16:25,287 --> 01:16:28,040
Maybe sometimes on the computer,
other times on the bed.

1199
01:16:28,127 --> 01:16:30,641
Don't be afraid to try new things, huh?

1200
01:16:30,767 --> 01:16:34,999
Next, we have a caller from Alaska.
Go ahead, caller.

1201
01:16:35,647 --> 01:16:39,276
RUSTY:
Yes, hi. I'm supposed to get ma.rried.

1202
01:16:39,847 --> 01:16:41,439
Congratulations.

1203
01:16:41,647 --> 01:16:44,161
RUSTY: Yeah, but the problem is
the girl I'm marrying.

1204
01:16:44,247 --> 01:16:47,717
She's awesome, but I don't really love her.

1205
01:16:48,087 --> 01:16:50,123
Does your fia.ncée know how you feel?

1206
01:16:50,247 --> 01:16:53,523
No, she has no idea.
And I know it would kill her.

1207
01:16:54,367 --> 01:16:55,561
Well, Ala.ska....

1208
01:16:55,647 --> 01:16:56,602
MR. MCGEE: Come on!

1209
01:16:56,687 --> 01:16:59,360
...the best a.dvice I ca.n give you is...

1210
01:17:01,087 --> 01:17:03,396
to move your feet to the bea.t ofyour hea.rt.

1211
01:17:03,527 --> 01:17:06,963
But my heart beats
for the second hoseman on my truck.

1212
01:17:07,207 --> 01:17:10,085
Then you must go to the hoseman, Alaska.

1213
01:17:10,207 --> 01:17:11,925
You must go to the hoseman.

1214
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:13,326
He doesn't seem himself.

1215
01:17:13,447 --> 01:17:16,086
I feel sorry for the girl marrying the homo.

1216
01:17:16,327 --> 01:17:20,161
It's quite a responsibility
being a spiritual guru, isn't it?

1217
01:17:20,887 --> 01:17:22,286
Yeah, it is.

1218
01:17:27,607 --> 01:17:30,201
But there is something I have to say.

1219
01:17:34,327 --> 01:17:35,919
I am not a guru.

1220
01:17:36,367 --> 01:17:37,322
AUDIENCE: What?

1221
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,318
There goes the book deal.

1222
01:17:39,647 --> 01:17:41,603
All I've ever done is...

1223
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:43,965
is to teach dance.

1224
01:17:44,047 --> 01:17:45,002
SALLY: What?

1225
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:49,638
RAMU: I tried to act.
I came to America to be in movies...

1226
01:17:51,007 --> 01:17:52,759
well, to be on TV.

1227
01:17:54,087 --> 01:17:55,600
RAMU: But I'm a. fa.ke.

1228
01:17:55,687 --> 01:17:57,678
(Tender instrumental music)

1229
01:17:59,247 --> 01:18:02,922
I have betrayed you all and...

1230
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,759
I am sorry, l....

1231
01:18:06,287 --> 01:18:07,561
I have to go.

1232
01:18:11,807 --> 01:18:14,196
-All your wisdom....
-It was just an act.

1233
01:18:14,287 --> 01:18:17,040
But, I gave up all my stuff.

1234
01:18:17,807 --> 01:18:20,446
I am sorry. I'm a fake.

1235
01:18:20,527 --> 01:18:22,483
What does that make me?

1236
01:18:22,567 --> 01:18:25,081
I now have all these ideas,
and they came from me...

1237
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:27,362
not from Va.nity Fa.ir or my mother.

1238
01:18:27,447 --> 01:18:30,484
-How can you say that's fake?
-It's not.

1239
01:18:30,567 --> 01:18:32,523
No, I didn't change you.

1240
01:18:32,647 --> 01:18:35,480
The guru you saw in me
was the guru in you.

1241
01:18:36,847 --> 01:18:39,042
In your lie I found my truth.

1242
01:18:39,127 --> 01:18:43,006
(Tender instrumental music)

1243
01:18:54,047 --> 01:18:55,480
RAMU: Come on, Vij.

1244
01:18:55,567 --> 01:18:57,558
(Uplifting instrumental music)

1245
01:18:58,687 --> 01:19:00,405
That's our Lexi.

1246
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:05,275
(Studio audience applauds)

1247
01:19:06,407 --> 01:19:10,082
-What are we doing? Where are we going?
-To get the woman I love.

1248
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:12,158
(Adventurous instrumental music)

1249
01:19:13,527 --> 01:19:16,041
Hey, can you get to the Bronx
in 15 minutes?

1250
01:19:16,127 --> 01:19:19,403
I'm a cab driver.
I can get to Bombay in 15 minutes.

1251
01:19:21,887 --> 01:19:25,482
(Rock 'n' roll song)

1252
01:19:35,007 --> 01:19:38,477
(Organ plays wedding song)

1253
01:19:38,567 --> 01:19:40,364
I'm so proud of you.

1254
01:19:40,887 --> 01:19:44,721
This whole thing has made me
want to go back to documentaries.

1255
01:19:49,807 --> 01:19:52,799
(Rock 'n' roll song)

1256
01:19:55,487 --> 01:19:57,000
She's marrying someone else.

1257
01:19:57,087 --> 01:19:59,157
You can't interrupt a wedding and
take the bride.

1258
01:19:59,247 --> 01:20:01,681
Sure I can.
Haven't you seen any American movies?

1259
01:20:01,767 --> 01:20:03,962
It happens here all the time.

1260
01:20:08,407 --> 01:20:10,238
About fucking time, man.

1261
01:20:10,327 --> 01:20:12,158
Don't speak to me like that.

1262
01:20:12,247 --> 01:20:13,646
Come on.

1263
01:20:14,447 --> 01:20:16,836
Just don't forget,
I'm the one doing you a favour.

1264
01:20:16,927 --> 01:20:17,996
Right.

1265
01:20:18,087 --> 01:20:20,920
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
in the sight of God...

1266
01:20:21,007 --> 01:20:22,998
to witness the sacrament of marriage.

1267
01:20:23,087 --> 01:20:26,523
-It was your stupid idea.
-Vij, you're a real bastard.

1268
01:20:27,887 --> 01:20:29,036
Rammy.

1269
01:20:29,807 --> 01:20:31,604
Is that your plumber?

1270
01:20:34,327 --> 01:20:35,521
Carry on.

1271
01:20:35,607 --> 01:20:36,756
Thank you.

1272
01:20:45,247 --> 01:20:50,241
...should not be joined together
in holy matrimony speak now...

1273
01:20:50,527 --> 01:20:52,597
or forever hold your peace.

1274
01:20:53,447 --> 01:20:54,562
I do.

1275
01:20:56,167 --> 01:20:57,316
Randy.

1276
01:20:58,727 --> 01:21:01,321
Who are they? The new Village People?

1277
01:21:02,167 --> 01:21:04,078
-You first.
-You first.

1278
01:21:04,167 --> 01:21:05,839
-No, you first.
-No, you first.

1279
01:21:05,927 --> 01:21:07,201
I insist.

1280
01:21:07,527 --> 01:21:08,960
Come on, man.

1281
01:21:09,127 --> 01:21:12,961
If you please, I am trying to conduct
a wedding ceremony here.

1282
01:21:13,247 --> 01:21:15,442
But I thought you said we could speak now.

1283
01:21:15,607 --> 01:21:19,680
It was merely an expression
as in "get lost." Please leave.

1284
01:21:20,367 --> 01:21:21,846
I can't leave.

1285
01:21:22,447 --> 01:21:24,244
Because if I leave...

1286
01:21:25,167 --> 01:21:27,806
I leave everything that matters to me.

1287
01:21:29,047 --> 01:21:32,357
Sharrona, you have taught me
so much about so many things...

1288
01:21:33,647 --> 01:21:36,207
but right now I know something you don't.

1289
01:21:36,287 --> 01:21:38,881
(Tender instrumental music)

1290
01:21:38,967 --> 01:21:40,764
RAMU: This is just a dream.

1291
01:21:41,767 --> 01:21:44,964
Ma.ybe you've ha.d it for so long
you think it ha.s to become rea.I...

1292
01:21:45,047 --> 01:21:46,560
but it doesn't.

1293
01:21:46,647 --> 01:21:49,525
We live, and life brings us new dreams.

1294
01:21:50,967 --> 01:21:52,116
Better ones.

1295
01:21:54,767 --> 01:21:58,965
Ones that come from the heart,
and not from the mind.

1296
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:04,556
Dreams that you cannot predict...

1297
01:22:05,727 --> 01:22:07,046
Iike you.

1298
01:22:10,487 --> 01:22:12,682
That is why I cannot leave...

1299
01:22:13,607 --> 01:22:17,441
because my heart beats
for that lady up there.

1300
01:22:19,447 --> 01:22:24,362
And I am not leaving here until
I find out if her heart beats for me.

1301
01:22:28,007 --> 01:22:30,043
Well, Sherri?

1302
01:22:31,287 --> 01:22:34,836
Yes, my heart beats for you.

1303
01:22:47,367 --> 01:22:50,040
That's the lndian fella couldn't get it up.

1304
01:22:50,167 --> 01:22:52,317
I thought you said he was Native American.

1305
01:22:52,407 --> 01:22:53,362
Yeah.

1306
01:22:53,447 --> 01:22:55,165
And you, young man.

1307
01:22:55,567 --> 01:22:57,159
Why a.re you here?

1308
01:22:57,287 --> 01:22:58,925
I agree with him.

1309
01:23:00,287 --> 01:23:02,960
Well, proceed. I'm not paid by the hour.

1310
01:23:03,367 --> 01:23:04,516
Rusty.

1311
01:23:05,847 --> 01:23:08,077
My heart beats for Rusty.

1312
01:23:09,767 --> 01:23:11,166
(Mrs. McGee gasps)

1313
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:15,076
-That's good. Get that.
-I'm on it.

1314
01:23:15,567 --> 01:23:17,285
DWAIN: Good angle for her.

1315
01:23:17,687 --> 01:23:22,283
Russell, we always knew
you swam upstream.

1316
01:23:22,407 --> 01:23:23,522
Amen.

1317
01:23:25,847 --> 01:23:27,439
Come here, baby.

1318
01:23:27,527 --> 01:23:30,997
(Joyous instrumental music)

1319
01:23:35,127 --> 01:23:37,516
-There's a market for this.
-Yeah.

1320
01:23:37,927 --> 01:23:39,406
My little firebug.

1321
01:23:39,487 --> 01:23:41,239
GUEST: There you go, ma'am.

1322
01:23:41,727 --> 01:23:43,365
Peg, get over it.

1323
01:23:50,127 --> 01:23:52,766
Well, enough of this swapping of spit.

1324
01:23:54,527 --> 01:23:56,119
FATHER: Let's celebrate!

1325
01:23:56,207 --> 01:23:57,322
CONGREGATION: Yeah!
