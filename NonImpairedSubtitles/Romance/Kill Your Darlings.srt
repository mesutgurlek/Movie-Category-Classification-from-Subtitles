1
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,217
Some things,

2
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,883
once you've loved them,

3
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,655
become yours forever.

4
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,423
And if you try to let them go

5
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:59,937
they only circle back and return to you.

6
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,506
They become part of who you are.

7
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,880
"Or they destroy you."

8
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,551
You can't show this to anyone.

9
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,788
- Then tell the truth, Lu.
- You weren't even there.

10
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:25,864
It's your truth. It's fiction.

11
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:33,437
You wanted him gone, too.
You sent him to me.

12
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,432
Please. You'll kill me with that.

13
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:39,636
Allen!

14
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,544
No. Allen!

15
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,607
Don't. No!

16
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:46,707
Don't!

17
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,658
World News Today.

18
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:57,388
American daylight bombers
were busy again today.

19
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,261
Our Liberators with fighter escort
have continued the air offensive

20
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,301
with another sock at German
coastal installations in France.

21
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,927
Mud and slush are hampering
the Russian armies

22
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,597
from Estonia to the Black Sea,

23
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,972
bu! the Germans report a big
new Red Army push toward Romania.

24
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,737
A dispatch from Turkey says the Germans

25
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,973
have begun another general offensive
against the Yugoslav partisans,

26
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:19,573
and, in the Pacific, American troops
on Los Negros fought a...

27
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,827
Any mail come for me?

28
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,495
Why? Are you expecting something?

29
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:41,868
No. No.

30
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,376
I told you it wouldn't work.

31
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,678
Mom?

32
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,694
You gotta get me outta here.

33
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,731
He nailed the window shut
while I was in the bath.

34
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,458
Dad didn't do that, Mom.

35
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,058
I nailed the windows
because you're not right.

36
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:13,627
He can hear you. He got wires in the walls.

37
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,673
You have to rest, clear your head.

38
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:21,338
- Do you want to go back to Greystone'?
- You wouldn't dare put me back there.

39
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,903
Mom, Mom. Then listen to me.

40
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,539
He can hear you.

41
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,048
- Can he still hear me'?
- What did I just say?

42
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,897
It's all right.

43
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:40,987
Quiet down.

44
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,033
Don't ever leave me.

45
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,295
Were you gonna tell me that you applied?

46
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,134
I didn't want her to know.

47
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:40,724
"Love that is hoarded moulds at last

48
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,622
"Until we know, the only thing we have"

49
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:45,958
"ls what we give away"

50
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,895
"ls what we hand away"

51
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,562
Have, hand. It's consonance.

52
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,433
Give, is. Assonance.

53
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,268
Hey, I wrote the goddamn poem.

54
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,399
All right?

55
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,275
Why don't you go write your own?

56
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,476
Open it.

57
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,210
- I got in.
- You got in?

58
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,041
- To Columbia University.
- You got into Columbia.

59
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,307
Yes!

60
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,659
You don't wanna go down there.

61
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,388
It's the land of the fairies.

62
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,330
Head there, you never come back.

63
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,903
Luke Detweiler, Danville, Virginia.

64
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,096
Allen Ginsberg.

65
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,704
You're Jewish, right?

66
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,909
I'm getting good at telling.

67
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,113
The South Hall library is a church

68
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,080
and these are the sacraments,

69
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,618
original folios
of the most important texts in history.

70
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,954
<i>Beowulf.</i>

71
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:53,183
First Folio Hamlet.

72
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,353
The Gutenberg Bible.

73
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,254
These are among
the university's prized possessions.

74
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,898
Hands off the glass.

75
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,530
Let's hear a bit, shall we?

76
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,874
"On a Sunday afternoon,

77
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,773
"when the shutters are down

78
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:14,903
"and the proletariat possesses the street

79
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:18,973
"there are certain thoroughfares
which remind one of nothing less

80
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,108
"than a big

81
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,618
"cancerous

82
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,712
"cock."

83
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,956
- What is this nonsense?
- Henry Miller.

84
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,899
Get down immediately.

85
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,460
That book is restricted.

86
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,403
Which is why I committed it 10 memory.

87
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,964
Security.

88
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,003
What the hell are you doing?

89
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:51,742
Alert the press.
Tell them Lucien Carr is innocent.

90
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,346
That was highly unusual.

91
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,082
Campus is actually quite quiet.

92
00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,851
Moving on.

93
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,752
The Victorian sonnet
has the balance of three tenets,

94
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,629
rhyme, metre, conceit.

95
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,669
Without this balance, a poem becomes slack,

96
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,863
an untucked shirt.

97
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,770
Professor Steeves.

98
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,637
Then how do you explain Whitman?

99
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,944
Say more. Two more sentences.

100
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,348
Well, he hated rhyme and metre.

101
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,817
The whole point was untucking your shirt.

102
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,856
What's your name?

103
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,824
- Allen Ginsberg.
Ginsberg?

104
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:38,727
Your father, perhaps,
is the poet Louis Ginsberg?

105
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,191
He writes with rhyming metred verse.

106
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,290
Why do you think he chose that form?

107
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,299
Because it's easier.

108
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:54,707
This university exists
because of tradition and form.

109
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:57,645
Would you rather
this building be built by engineers

110
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,207
or Whitman and his boys at play?

111
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,752
There can be no creation

112
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,147
before imitation.

113
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,386
Reports from the front say the Nazis

114
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,226
are wheeling up fresh materiel and reserves.

115
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,424
Shut the books.

116
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,365
We're taking my brother with us to the social.

117
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:19,199
He ships out tomorrow.

118
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,933
I can't. You see how much I have to do.

119
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,838
He's Navy. It's catnip for the skins.

120
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,537
You hymies are really all about work, huh?

121
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,461
Brahms?

122
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,095
Finally.

123
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:31,808
An oasis in this wasteland.

124
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,309
So how come you're not at the social?

125
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,816
Only the most antisocial have to go
to an event actually called one.

126
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,979
- Libation?
- What, you drink in your room?

127
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:47,251
How does a horrible bottle of Chianti sound?

128
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,155
I don't drink.

129
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,162
Freshman?

130
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:56,166
- Yes.
- Excellent. I love first times.

131
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,827
I want my entire life to be composed of them.

132
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:01,701
Life is only interesting if life is wide.

133
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,511
To Walt Whitman.

134
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,477
You dirty bastard.

135
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,607
How's your Yeats?

136
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,846
Have you read A Vision?

137
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,387
Never heard of it.

138
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,320
It's completely brilliant.

139
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,222
And impossible.

140
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:24,784
He says that life is round.

141
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:30,624
That we're stuck on this wheel
of living and dying.

142
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,966
An endless circle.

143
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,369
Until

144
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,031
someone breaks it.

145
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,406
You walked in here.
You ruptured the pattern.

146
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,979
- Bang. The whole world gets wider.
- Gets wider.

147
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,975
- How did you...
-it's consonance.

148
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,147
A reiteration of themes.

149
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,153
Are you a writer?

150
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,586
'Cause I've got a job for a writer.

151
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,495
No, I'm not.

152
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,829
Well, you're not anything yet.

153
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:16,506
Ginsberg.

154
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,575
Isn't that you?

155
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,447
- Ginsberg!
What?

156
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,043
Phone call.

157
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,515
I'll be back.

158
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,056
Thank you.

159
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,620
- Hello.
- I found the wires.

160
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,257
He's trying to get inside my head.

161
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:39,929
Dad is not trying
to get inside your head, okay?

162
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,232
Put him on.

163
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,971
He's not here. He left.

164
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,607
Where'd he go?

165
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,409
Honey, I need you to come home now.

166
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,440
Mom, I can't come home.

167
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,985
Listen to me.

168
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,652
<i>You have to look after yourself</i>

169
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,248
I don't feel good.

170
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,958
- Are you going to the dance?
- Downtown.

171
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:08,089
- Now?
- Who are you talking to?

172
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,462
- No one.
- Is he there with you?

173
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,466
No, Mom, he's not here.

174
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,503
Look, I will be there as soon as I can.

175
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,095
I need you tonight.

176
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,567
I need you to promise me.

177
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,307
I promise. I love you.

178
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,472
Bye.

179
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,749
Coming?

180
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,293
Welcome to the edge of the world.

181
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,290
Allen in Wonderland.

182
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,537
- Do you know her?
- No, and I don't plan on it.

183
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:25,575
She tasted like imported sophistication
and domestic cigarettes.

184
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:32,381
Dave, where's the liquor'?

185
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,179
I'll be right back.

186
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,721
You are pinching.

187
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,425
- You are pinching.
- I'm sorry.

188
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,391
You okay?

189
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,672
What's that?

190
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,613
Nitrous oxide for narco analysis.

191
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:08,516
Know thyself and beshit thyself.

192
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,012
You ever done that?

193
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:23,466
No thanks. I don't do the cannabis.

194
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:28,403
Show me the man
who is both sober and happy,

195
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,931
and I will show you the crinkled anus

196
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:35,137
of a lying asshole.

197
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:42,209
Allen, Willy. Willy, Allen.

198
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,915
Lucien, reefer.

199
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:47,881
Nice meeting you.

200
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,951
- Is he a criminal?
- He wishes he were a criminal.

201
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,054
The Burroughs family is richer than God.

202
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,259
- Well, he looks like a criminal.
- He's a Harvard man.

203
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,802
He's going to be an amazing artist.

204
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,495
His current medium is himself.

205
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,238
- What's that?
-It's bunk for school.

206
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,509
Come on. I want you to meet our host.

207
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:16,413
What we have, darlings and demoiselles,
is a circle.

208
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,314
Life is round.

209
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:23,019
Patterns, routines,

210
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,528
a wheel of self-abuse.

211
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,360
Margaret, don't even deny it.

212
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:32,266
- He sounds like you.
- Because it was me first.

213
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:37,841
Until the disruption we long for comes along

214
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,171
and the circle is broken.

215
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:43,975
He used to be my guardian angel,
but he said I was too much work.

216
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:52,116
Take this unbloomed stalwart.

217
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,118
And you are?

218
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,127
Allen.

219
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,392
Allen.

220
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,629
Play nice, David.

221
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:13,141
- Who comes uninvited to my apartment.
- Actually, I invited him.

222
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,372
No one notices him.

223
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,506
Look at him. Why would we bother'?

224
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:25,880
So the pattern of our lives holds.

225
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,384
But who knows?

226
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:34,056
Under the right circumstances,
even he might change the world.

227
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:51,675
In the distance I heard a sound

228
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:56,712
<i>The sound of marching men</i>

229
00:17:56,842 --> 00:18:00,915
So you met Lucien in the lunch line,
and now he's all that you can see.

230
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,183
Why don't you like me?

231
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:07,789
Because David
was in the same godforsaken line.

232
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,368
And then

233
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,598
Some ear job at the bar just called me kid,

234
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,472
so I stole his drink.

235
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:22,979
That's Ogden Nash.

236
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:28,314
Who's Ogden Nash?
- The best-selling poet in the country.

237
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,750
Perhaps you've heard this one.

238
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:33,120
"The girl who is bespectacled
she may not get her nectacled

239
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,283
"But safety pins and bassinets..."

240
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,327
"Await the girl who fassinets."

241
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,796
And that's what he's selling? I'll kill him.

242
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,422
Aim for the throat.

243
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,071
No. We're not going to kill him.

244
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:54,639
Even better, we're going to make sure
nobody remembers him.

245
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,312
How many men started the Renaissance?

246
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,746
- Two.
- And the Romantics?

247
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,083
More, I suspect,
than this theory accommodates.

248
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:08,584
We're sending millions to Europe
to fight the fascists, but they're here.

249
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:13,589
- Metre and rhyme...
- And Professor Steeves.

250
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,428
Yes!

251
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,434
They're all guards in some prison.

252
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,699
Let's make the prisoners come out and play.

253
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,771
Let's come up with new words, new rhythms.

254
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,272
We need a name.

255
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,978
How did they come up with "Dada"?

256
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,682
Tristan Tzara jabbed a knife into a dictionary.

257
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,280
Shit. So that's been done.

258
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,358
A literary revolution without writing a word.

259
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,793
- Neat trick, Lu.
- Well, I'm listening.

260
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,456
What about Yeats?

261
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,494
The New Vision.

262
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,468
Harlem soldiers on the ground

263
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,141
Ginsy.

264
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,974
You're hired.

265
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:08,144
On parade

266
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,231
Keep it moving, gentlemen.

267
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,822
Stay in line.

268
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,492
Fucking perverts.

269
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:32,932
"In the dawn, armed with a burning patience

270
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:36,536
"we shall enter the splendid city."

271
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:40,407
- Shit.
-It's Rimbaud.

272
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,747
It's overwritten, I know. He's allowed.

273
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,378
No. My mother.

274
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,616
This is bad. This is very bad.

275
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,419
What is?

276
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,585
She's gonna be furious.

277
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:53,220
- Don't go then.
- You don't understand. I have to.

278
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:56,232
- Why?
-It's complicated.

279
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,701
Perfect.

280
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,535
I love complicated.

281
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,403
- Dad?
- Sign here. Greystone will alert you...

282
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,971
What's going on?

283
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,883
Your mother needs her rest.

284
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,415
Ma.

285
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,257
You can't do this.

286
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,324
Where were you?

287
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,406
I was outwith a friend.

288
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,135
- I called you.
- I know.

289
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,943
- It's time to go, Mrs Ginsberg.
- No, you're not leaving.

290
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,981
- He's already signed the papers.
- Dad, don't.

291
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,639
- It's for the best, son.
- Your best.

292
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:47,649
You know... it's for her best.

293
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,913
It's not for my best. It's for her best.
Look at her.

294
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,352
- No.
- Listen to her.

295
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,150
- He's not gonna...
- I know it's not. Don't...

296
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,452
Mom. Mom. Mom. Get off.

297
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,193
This is your fault.

298
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,169
Complicated enough?

299
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,645
At least you have her.

300
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,921
My father left me when I was four.

301
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,664
I've been thinking about what Yeats said.

302
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:22,042
To be reborn, you have to die first.

303
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,513
What do you suggest?

304
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:34,680
I spent my entire life
making other people happy.

305
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,125
It's time I find happiness
the only way I see possible.

306
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,923
Oh, please.

307
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:40,895
Die already.

308
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:43,957
Where's the verve? The brio?

309
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:49,033
If it be that I am indulging
my self-consciousness

310
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,597
in justifying myself or if it be...

311
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,870
- That's a run-on.
- Don't edit me.

312
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:22,631
- The New Vision declares...
-"Proclaims. " It's better.

313
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:25,299
Proclaims the death of morality.

314
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,399
The expression of self.

315
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,606
The true, uninhibited, uncensored
expression of the self.

316
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,081
Words, boys. Empty words.

317
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:37,280
- Well, what do you suggest?
- The derangement of the senses.

318
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:00,336
What do you hate from the pit of your gut?

319
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,605
- Institutions.
Paterson, New Jersey.

320
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,441
- My father.
- Bingo.

321
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,620
And the Shakespeare...

322
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,393
All right.

323
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:23,359
Extraordinary men propel society forward.

324
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,366
It is our duty to break the law.

325
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,368
- Really?
-It's how we make the world wider.

326
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,065
- You are an extraordinary man.
- Well, thank you.

327
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:32,472
Return of the Native.

328
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,310
Leviathan.

329
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:41,251
Tear 'em up, boys.
Destroy the old and build the new.

330
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,086
Chaucer. Gibbon.

331
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:11,101
Watch this.

332
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,301
Go.

333
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,113
What the hell is this?

334
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,488
Time slows down

335
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:07,190
as you drift deeper and deeper
into your cave.

336
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:11,359
We are exploring the avenues
of Allen's mind.

337
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:15,967
Dimly lit, I'm sure.
What have you done to my apartment?

338
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,304
Don't touch anything.
We need to write it all down.

339
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:22,036
Grab a pair of scissors.
Get this man a pair of scissors.

340
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,146
This is not your revolution. This is my life.

341
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,480
What kind of life is it, David?

342
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,577
It's mine.

343
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:31,712
Not everyone gets an allowance.

344
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,714
Leave.

345
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,925
Just get out.

346
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:42,359
I need to speak with you.

347
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,165
Alone.

348
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,382
It only has to be five pages.

349
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:09,426
You make me too smart,
they're gonna suspect somethings up.

350
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,960
And get you sent back to your mother again?

351
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,121
That would just be the end of you.

352
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:16,923
Fuck you.

353
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,772
Kill your darlings,

354
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,869
your crushes, your juvenile metaphysics.

355
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,642
None of them belong on the page.

356
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:36,611
It is the first principle of good creative work,

357
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:40,246
a work of fiction you will deliver
as your final exam.

358
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:43,454
Look.

359
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:46,927
Whitman Junior graced us
with his presence today.

360
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,560
"The New Vision.

361
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,300
"Extraordinary men propel us forward.

362
00:29:57,396 --> 00:30:00,673
"It is our duty to break the law."

363
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,643
Fantastic.

364
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,510
There's more life in those five pages

365
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:08,448
than in the dozens of bad sonnets
we've read in this class.

366
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:12,687
You want life?

367
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:14,689
You want the world on fire?

368
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,253
The war awaits.

369
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:23,425
What will it be?

370
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:30,498
"The rose that scents the summer air

371
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:33,269
"grows from my beloveds hair."

372
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:35,805
Keep going. That's my sonnet for Steeves.

373
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,608
We have the map.

374
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,512
We have the manifesto.

375
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:41,546
We need the work.

376
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,986
I was wrong.

377
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:53,456
Maybe you're not up for this after all.

378
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,665
- Show me your fucking map.
- Stop.

379
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:02,899
No, there's nothing here because
Davids not hereto write it for you.

380
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,634
- It's complicated.
- I love complicated.

381
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:16,015
He is a professor working as a janitor

382
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,418
so he can be near his precious Lu-Lu.

383
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,980
He is a goddamn fruit who won't let me go.

384
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,323
A fruit?

385
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,354
A queer.

386
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,336
Then...

387
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:49,584
You know, let's get rid of him.

388
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:05,029
Right now' I just need you
to write us something beautiful.

389
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,963
First thought, best thought.

390
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:55,013
Allen in Wonderland.

391
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:11,457
Pervitin.

392
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:16,465
The Germans called it the “Wunderdroge."

393
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:20,440
Prescribed for superhuman feats.

394
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,856
But beware of the side effects

395
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,791
which include sudden bouts of blindness,

396
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,693
diarrhea, heart palpitations

397
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:44,130
and a severe decline in moral standards.

398
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,577
Unbloomed stalwart.

399
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:58,913
Come out and play.

400
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:02,975
What the hell are you doing?

401
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:05,077
Writing.

402
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,013
But the words...

403
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:11,727
Oh, the words.

404
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:16,655
Yeah.

405
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,032
Lu, it's very rough.

406
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:28,174
The vision at last.

407
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,007
Can I see'?

408
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,075
- Where's Lu?
- He's out.

409
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:38,587
With a senior football player.

410
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,216
A writer.

411
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,259
And handsome, too.

412
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,255
James?

413
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:48,528
Jack. There it is.

414
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:49,888
Jack.

415
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,062
You're not allowed to be here.

416
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,238
That's odd since I'm the only thing
keeping him here.

417
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,066
Not any more.

418
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,407
Piece of advice.

419
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,443
You don't know Lu.

420
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:14,453
As soon as you think you do,
he'll find someone else.

421
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:17,623
Maybe he already has.

422
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:25,724
What, are you moving in?

423
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:32,306
Where have you been?

424
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,473
I found a real writer.

425
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:39,612
Already a million words
under his belt before Columbia.

426
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,448
You mean Jack?

427
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:44,920
Why didn't you tell me?

428
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,280
What, am I supposed to do newsreels?

429
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,255
What's that?

430
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,363
Oh, nothing.

431
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:02,270
If you're going to stay, don't hog the blanket.

432
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,457
Why is Jack a real writer?

433
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,721
Once you meet him, you'll see what I mean.

434
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,329
- Hey, Al.
- No.

435
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,869
- Come on.
- No.

436
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,227
No.

437
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:40,865
Fumble.

438
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:45,337
- Jack, what was that?
- The damn cat.

439
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,352
She painted it. Say nothing.

440
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,895
- Hey, when did this come?
- Today.

441
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,726
It's from Sammy. Where is he now'?

442
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:06,996
I don't know. Some battleship.

443
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,562
What do you think?

444
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,231
It's brilliant, no?

445
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,275
It's missing some periods and commas.

446
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,571
It's better than anything you've ever written.

447
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:18,238
- I use periods and commas.
- Both of you, quiet.

448
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:21,741
Kerouac. How are you, chum?

449
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,076
Sammy, you bastard.

450
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,354
Who's Sammy?

451
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:29,089
My best friend since I was 12. Off in the Navy.

452
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,751
We've just been through 20 days
of German shelling

453
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,887
every three hours, night and day.

454
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,596
This will be my last one for a while.

455
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:41,762
<i>Tomorrow</i> we're <i>headed our to the front,
some beach</i> near <i>Rome. Anzio?</i>

456
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,964
Go sit at the table.

457
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:45,302
It's supposed to be beautiful...

458
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,211
I didn't know we were having guests.

459
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,144
What's this?

460
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:01,380
I was aiming for stew.

461
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,322
Yeah? You missed.

462
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,259
Come on, guys.

463
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,593
- Where are you going?
- Out.

464
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,634
Out'? I have been cooking all day for you.

465
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,760
What? What do you want?
Want me to eat shoe leather?

466
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,964
I'm hungry, and what you do
in the kitchen's unholy.

467
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,598
That's funny. You talk like a Catholic,
but you fuck me and won't marry me.

468
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,302
- How does that work?
- Shut your mouth, Edie.

469
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,345
I thought you liked it wide open.

470
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,616
Scram.

471
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,358
Allen.

472
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,599
So, Al. Thought my novel was shit?

473
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:47,767
- Not exactly. It's not what I would choose...
-it's all true.

474
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,495
Jack sewed in the merchant marines.

475
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:52,541
I left school twice already.

476
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,337
Columbia's full of squares.

477
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,339
Not even sure why I bothered to come back.

478
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:00,509
Why don't you just ship out again?

479
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:04,018
Trust me, sometimes
when I fight with Edie, I want to.

480
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,018
Well, you two did just fight.

481
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,791
Carr, you're goddamn crazy.

482
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,403
"A new vision." Yeah.

483
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:24,871
Sounds phoney.

484
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:30,673
Movements are cooked up by people
who can't write about the people who can.

485
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,045
I don't think he gets what we're trying to do.

486
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,548
Listen to me.

487
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:38,479
This whole town's full of finks
on the 30th floor writing pure chintz.

488
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,886
Writers. A real writers gotta be in the beds,

489
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:46,589
down in the trenches
and all the broken places.

490
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:49,997
Where were your trenches, Al?

491
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,334
- Allen.
- Right.

492
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,265
First thought, best thought.

493
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:55,861
Fuck you. What does that even mean?

494
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:58,430
That's good. That's one. What else?

495
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,004
- Fuck your one million words.
- Yes, even better.

496
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,835
You don't know me.

497
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:05,507
You're right.

498
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,781
Who is "you"?

499
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,255
"Be careful.

500
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:25,726
"You are not in Wonderland.

501
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:32,366
"I've heard the strange madness
long growing in your soul.

502
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,574
"But you are fortunate in your ignorance,

503
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,879
"in your isolation.

504
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,314
"You who have suffered

505
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,224
"find where love hides.

506
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:54,263
"Give, share, lose,

507
00:40:57,722 --> 00:41:00,931
"lest we die unbloomed."

508
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,745
Al?

509
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,015
That was beautiful, kid.

510
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,254
You wrote that?

511
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,484
You asked me to.

512
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:29,629
Forget Columbia.

513
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,094
Forget Ogden Nash.

514
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:36,596
Here's the plan, boys.
We join the merchant marines,

515
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,665
sail the world until the war ends,

516
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:44,270
then jump ship and make it
to Paris for the liberation.

517
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,340
And you don't speak French.

518
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,940
Jack does.

519
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,554
It'll be us together at the beginning.

520
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,625
It'll be the perfect day.

521
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:07,396
- Jesus Christ.
- Get your hands in the air.

522
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:17,006
You have managed to matriculate
and drop out

523
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:21,380
of Tulane, Bowdoin
and the University of Chicago.

524
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:26,712
Your attendance record here is abominable.

525
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,181
You've ignored curfew.

526
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:32,226
Your papers,
when you bother to turn them in,

527
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:34,853
exceed the assigned page limit.

528
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,598
Can you explain why you're at Columbia?

529
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:44,836
- Well, the same reason you are.
- What is that?

530
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,505
Loose Barnard girls.

531
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:55,541
I know about your difficulties,
about what happened in Chicago.

532
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:05,225
- You told him?
- He's not the enemy.

533
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,928
You see, the university acts in loco parentis.

534
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:11,428
You are our responsibility.

535
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,401
We're trying to find some way
to make this all work for you.

536
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,903
Who said anybody could know
anything about anything?

537
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,274
Lucien, your temper.

538
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:24,471
Things were going fine

539
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:28,415
and you're just spreading rumours
to get me kicked out of here.

540
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:31,044
Allen. What the hell's going on?

541
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,753
Who's she?

542
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:36,817
Hi. I'm Edith Cohen.

543
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:39,720
What's she doing here?

544
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:42,088
I've been divorced for some time.

545
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,290
I'll go wait outside.

546
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:46,561
This is the kind of childish outburst...

547
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:51,571
So that's why you locked Mom up.

548
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:55,410
Get back here immediately.

549
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,968
Lucien. Lucien.

550
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:03,908
- Lucien!
- Did he put you up to this?

551
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:08,088
No.

552
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,319
I stole the boat.

553
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:14,919
And it was tremendous.

554
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,507
Where are you going?

555
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:35,942
You know me now.

556
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:40,449
I'm only good at beginnings.

557
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:42,352
What, you're dropping out?

558
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:48,494
Best of luck.

559
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:56,165
Okay-

560
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:59,970
My father showed up today
with some new woman

561
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:05,038
and in the middle of all
the "Allen's a screw-up" monologue,

562
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:08,481
all of a sudden, I realised I don't care.

563
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,582
I've never not cared.

564
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:17,323
So, I told them it was my idea

565
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,085
to steal the boat.

566
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:22,687
Why?

567
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:26,323
Because I don't want to be
the person they think I am.

568
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,570
I am on academic probation
and I could get kicked out.

569
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,505
You can't leave.

570
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:39,515
You started something and I have no idea
what I'm supposed to do next.

571
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,077
It's our turn.

572
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,951
Let's show them what we can do.

573
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,524
You in?

574
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,762
You mustn't drink while you're handling it,
and no writing in it.

575
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,602
It comes back exactly as you've got it.

576
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:06,868
Next.

577
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,971
Once you get the book,
treat it very, very well.

578
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:14,913
And you don't break the binding.
Now follow me.

579
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,710
All right.

580
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:22,887
Hey, no telling Edie.

581
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:32,064
Maybe you can help me with something.
You're checking out all these books.

582
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:35,229
I'm asking myself,
do you ever get checked out?

583
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,440
Twenty-five seconds.

584
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,334
Masterful.

585
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:42,342
- Hi.
- Hi.

586
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:46,908
Damn it. Shift's over.

587
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:49,110
See you tomorrow.

588
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:51,614
I'll go.

589
00:46:58,749 --> 00:46:59,750
Hi.

590
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:02,258
I wondered if you could help me.

591
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:04,122
Sure.

592
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,760
I'm looking for a book.

593
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:09,268
Okay-

594
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:13,100
- Does this book have a title?
- Yes. Yes.

595
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:18,839
<i>It's called The Day Amanda Came.</i>

596
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:30,852
Well, you'll have lo wait.

597
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,560
I can't leave the desk.

598
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,696
I really need it.

599
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:48,166
Okay-

600
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,175
Only for you.

601
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:06,920
Shit.

602
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,724
So working here must be a drag.

603
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,261
I like it. It's the only way I meet boys.

604
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,265
They're very, very strict at Barnard.

605
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,201
Oh, really? How strict?

606
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,833
Well, for example,
they would never let me do this.

607
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:22,043
Right. No.

608
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,838
Go.

609
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:28,343
Did you know I've never done it
with someone who was Jewish before?

610
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,784
I'm really excited to see what it looks like.

611
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,115
Well...

612
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,252
I'm sorry.

613
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:40,453
I thought you were saying something,
but not saying it.

614
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:42,462
Should we find your book?

615
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:43,554
The key.

616
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,192
There is no book.

617
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,899
- Take it off.
- Really?

618
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,308
- You. You take it off.
- Oh, okay.

619
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:04,878
I'm not a virgin.
I have done it with four guys already.

620
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:13,254
You're kind of a virgin though, huh?

621
00:49:13,651 --> 00:49:15,631
- No.
- Liar.

622
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:19,633
See, if you have done it before,
you'll last for 30 seconds.

623
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:21,225
Stan counting.

624
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,440
One,

625
00:49:27,765 --> 00:49:28,937
two...

626
00:49:31,936 --> 00:49:33,108
Three...

627
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,179
Four...

628
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:40,582
Five...

629
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:43,623
Six,

630
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,091
seven,

631
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:48,591
eight...

632
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:54,433
Nine...

633
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,280
I knew it.

634
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,479
I bet you don't even read.

635
00:50:15,279 --> 00:50:16,383
I do.

636
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:22,460
This is it, guys. This is our Bastille.

637
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:24,732
No chickening out.

638
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,270
Excuse me.

639
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:14,838
I think I saw some light
or movement in the library.

640
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:43,868
What just happened?

641
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,607
We know you're here!

642
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:54,481
Come on.

643
00:52:05,756 --> 00:52:06,928
Lu?

644
00:52:06,991 --> 00:52:08,971
Bill, what the hell? It's locked!

645
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:11,835
This way.

646
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:22,649
I think they're this way.

647
00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:27,116
We know you're here.

648
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,152
Come out!

649
00:52:46,764 --> 00:52:47,765
Hey!

650
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:54,108
Lu, that's enough!
What's wrong with you? Come on.

651
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:57,544
Not yet. We have to finish.

652
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:00,611
Enough now! It's over!

653
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:04,350
Let me go! Allen!

654
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:06,121
Let go! Let...

655
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,459
Allen! Get off of me.

656
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:10,897
- One prick.
- Allen.

657
00:53:10,988 --> 00:53:12,296
Allen!

658
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,139
Let's go!

659
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:26,375
You guys open this goddamn door right now.

660
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:34,353
Open this fucking door right now.

661
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:36,152
Open the fuck up. Open the...

662
00:53:41,919 --> 00:53:44,331
The South Hall library is a church

663
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:48,029
and these are the sacraments...

664
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:03,117
Oh, m)'

665
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:04,379
God.

666
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,521
- To literacy.
- To literacy indeed.

667
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:23,263
- Jack, that's you, isn't it?
- Yup. Last year.

668
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:27,565
They still won.

669
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:30,201
Look at them.

670
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:34,875
Souvenir history.

671
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:41,049
To make people think
they left some mark on the world.

672
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:46,217
Because otherwise,
nobody would ever know.

673
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:51,494
I never want to end up on that wall.

674
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:54,259
Have no fear. You never will.

675
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:00,065
What's he doing here?

676
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,912
Since you didn't stop by earlier,
I just hoped to give you this.

677
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,185
Maybe he didn't want to see you.

678
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:14,153
I think he can speak for himself.

679
00:55:17,114 --> 00:55:20,823
Yup. He says that we should
all have another round.

680
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:22,591
You've had plenty of time to celebrate.

681
00:55:23,187 --> 00:55:25,599
Your library high jinks
made the morning paper.

682
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:27,966
I'm sure you're all very proud.

683
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:33,004
How do you know it was us?

684
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:36,706
Did he use that Bastille line?
'Cause I gave it to him.

685
00:55:39,303 --> 00:55:41,943
I haven't seen you for days.

686
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:47,622
You left this at my place.

687
00:55:53,317 --> 00:55:56,628
You told the guards we were there.
Nobody else knew.

688
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:05,507
You wanted me to get kicked out.
You ratted on me.

689
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:09,237
Stop, Lu. You're losing control.
You know what comes next.

690
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:11,574
- I know what comes next.
-Yeah.

691
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:13,637
Cut him off.

692
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:21,554
Best of luck, Janitor.

693
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:26,257
- Excuse me?
- We are over.

694
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:29,191
Leave.

695
00:56:35,993 --> 00:56:37,495
Look at me, Lu.

696
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:43,774
You said I was everything to you.

697
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:50,749
You are everything to me.

698
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:54,720
Everything to me, do you hear me?

699
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,692
Let's go.

700
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,558
Please, Lu. Please?

701
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:06,627
David, time and place.

702
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:08,532
Shut up, traitor.

703
00:57:12,696 --> 00:57:14,471
You'd be dead if it weren't for me.

704
00:57:34,418 --> 00:57:37,456
You'd be boring if it weren't for me.

705
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:43,160
And go!

706
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,998
Oh. my God!

707
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:48,735
- Jack!
- Jack!

708
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:51,010
Jack!

709
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:58,147
He broke his fucking neck.
The warrior poet has passed on.

710
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:00,851
No!

711
00:58:01,178 --> 00:58:03,488
- He lives!
- Excellent!

712
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,821
Judges award a...

713
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:07,122
Nine!

714
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:11,362
- Oh, my God.
- Jack.

715
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:15,433
All right, Ginsy, your turn.

716
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,937
No, no, no, no.

717
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:26,173
This is just the beginning, you know.

718
00:58:30,474 --> 00:58:32,147
Your fault, Ginsy.

719
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,789
It's all your fault.

720
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:07,481
First thought, best thought.

721
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:36,177
I think I just puked on the inside.

722
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,915
Let's go, Jack.

723
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:51,288
- What?
- Wait. Al, are you coming?

724
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:53,299
No, Allen's got work to do.

725
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:58,703
Ten pages on Spengler's Decline of the West.
Due tomorrow.

726
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:00,739
Excuse me?

727
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,878
I'd be lost without you, Ginsy.

728
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:10,074
Come on, lion.

729
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:23,890
Fuck!

730
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:27,560
Allied fumes in Anzio...

731
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:30,237
Edie bird!

732
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,139
My Edie bird.

733
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:34,835
I'm just gonna use the loo.

734
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,973
Say hi to Gram.

735
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:42,107
...burrow and cover in
a honeycomb of trenches and foxholes.

736
01:00:42,172 --> 01:00:46,143
We invited her over for her birthday.
We made her a cake.

737
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:52,183
Well, then we should have a drink.
How about a drink, Grandma Frankie?

738
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:55,654
You want some red wine?

739
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,958
- Where the hell have you been?
- I was out.

740
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:03,463
I packed all your stuff. It's in your bag.
I'm gonna be at Gram's tonight.

741
01:01:03,527 --> 01:01:05,529
Hey, hey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

742
01:01:05,629 --> 01:01:07,040
- No, you just say that.
- I'm sorry.

743
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:10,668
It's one of your million words,
and they don't mean anything.

744
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:13,714
Just don't be here
when I come back in the morning.

745
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:51,414
I know this is crazy.

746
01:01:52,409 --> 01:01:57,518
I don't even know what I'm doing here,
but I just had to

747
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,494
tell you I'm sorry.

748
01:02:01,685 --> 01:02:03,687
Let me make it up to you.

749
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:08,027
Lu, where are you?

750
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:11,830
I'm going back to bed.

751
01:02:18,335 --> 01:02:20,838
Another word and I call the police.

752
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,356
What the hell?

753
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:54,606
Jesus Christ!

754
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:03,217
What kind of sick son of a bitch
would do something like this?

755
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:07,121
It was David.

756
01:03:07,217 --> 01:03:09,128
I'll wring his fucking neck.

757
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,322
It's okay. It's okay.

758
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:20,308
I have another idea.

759
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:02,215
Lu,

760
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:05,144
YOU!' paper.

761
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:14,451
Where are you going?

762
01:04:15,819 --> 01:04:17,230
Sailing out.

763
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:21,163
To Paris.

764
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:27,137
We're gonna make a ship
as merchant seamen.

765
01:04:29,132 --> 01:04:31,009
Jack knows the tricks.

766
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,572
You weren't gonna tell me?

767
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,983
We both know why you can't come.

768
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:50,524
Fuck you!

769
01:04:54,758 --> 01:04:56,328
You're a phoney.

770
01:04:57,994 --> 01:05:01,532
And you got me and Jack and Bill
making your vision come true

771
01:05:01,598 --> 01:05:03,168
because you can't do it yourself.

772
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,577
No, Allen.

773
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:07,238
You got what you wanted.

774
01:05:07,337 --> 01:05:09,908
You were ordinary,
just like every other freshman.

775
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:13,010
And I made your life extraordinary.

776
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:16,348
Go be you now, all by yourself.
Leave me alone.

777
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:19,750
You don't mean that.

778
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,692
- Allen!
- Please.

779
01:05:25,188 --> 01:05:26,360
Leave.

780
01:06:05,562 --> 01:06:07,269
Allen, have you seen him?

781
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,274
- He's not in his room.
- He left.

782
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:14,248
I did something wrong.

783
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:16,673
Really wrong.

784
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,587
You have no reason to help me. But...

785
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,914
But?

786
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,688
I know who you are.

787
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:32,163
We're the ones he needs but never wants.

788
01:06:36,259 --> 01:06:38,637
It hurts, doesn't it?

789
01:06:42,265 --> 01:06:45,303
All I'm asking is that you tell me where he is.

790
01:06:48,872 --> 01:06:50,215
Please.

791
01:07:03,553 --> 01:07:05,499
Let me see your papers.

792
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,400
Two seamen reporting for duty.

793
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,294
What's your name?

794
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:13,634
Arthur Rimbaud.

795
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:16,568
Go upstairs to get on the docket.

796
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:19,478
Let's go get on the docket.

797
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:24,552
Goddamn son of a bitch!

798
01:07:24,641 --> 01:07:26,416
Let me handle this.

799
01:07:30,847 --> 01:07:32,986
How did you know that I would be here?

800
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:39,360
Listen, I spoke to a guy upstairs.
I got us two passes.

801
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:42,833
I packed for both of us.

802
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:45,162
We can leave.

803
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:51,073
The reason I am leaving is you.

804
01:07:57,206 --> 01:08:00,710
Then you and Jack take them. I'll catch up.

805
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,228
Come with me.

806
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,892
We're taking a walk.

807
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:22,770
Can I have a whisky, please?

808
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,736
I'm sorry.

809
01:09:09,412 --> 01:09:10,413
Lu?

810
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:35,483
This came for you today.

811
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:43,647
Sam.

812
01:09:52,455 --> 01:09:53,957
Jack, old chum.

813
01:09:57,026 --> 01:10:00,337
I'm on a hospital ship now.
My gut's all tore up.

814
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,645
Anzio's gonna be the last place
I ever see with my eyes.

815
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:20,827
A mortar round came
and found me in my tent.

816
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:31,069
I can feel metal under my skin some places.

817
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,265
Some wen! clean through.

818
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:38,569
They're not even trying
to take it out no more.

819
01:10:59,522 --> 01:11:01,934
The nurses gave me the same morphine

820
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:05,096
I gave to dying boys when
I didn't know what else to do.

821
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:22,983
"Wake, melancholy Mother,

822
01:11:27,917 --> 01:11:29,555
“wake and weep!

823
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:40,096
"Quench within

824
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:49,410
“their burning bed,
Thy fiery tears,

825
01:11:54,577 --> 01:11:56,853
“and let thou loud heart keep..."

826
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:02,960
What was that?

827
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:07,627
Shelley's elegy for Keats.

828
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:11,434
What does that mean?

829
01:12:13,763 --> 01:12:15,470
It means he's dead.

830
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:29,984
He didn't come back here afterward.

831
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:31,992
Nobody on the floor saw.

832
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:38,332
We have two in custody.
Were still gathering evidence.

833
01:12:39,222 --> 01:12:41,463
So what else do we know about this guy?

834
01:12:46,329 --> 01:12:49,538
Edie. ls Jack there?

835
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:52,069
You don't know?

836
01:12:52,168 --> 01:12:53,511
Know what?

837
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:59,653
The police came and took him
down to the Tombs

838
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:01,811
as an accessory.

839
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,221
Bill, too.

840
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,482
What happened?

841
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:40,191
Allen.

842
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:43,894
Thank God.

843
01:13:48,024 --> 01:13:50,231
He wanted to hurt me.

844
01:13:50,293 --> 01:13:51,772
I had no choice.

845
01:13:51,861 --> 01:13:54,137
You could've run, called the police.

846
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:55,709
Listen.

847
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:59,071
Somehow he found me at the Marine Hall.

848
01:14:00,703 --> 01:14:04,480
He said that no matter where I went,
he would follow.

849
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:09,421
When I confronted him, he exploded.

850
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:14,561
I had to defend myself.

851
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:17,725
He wouldn't stop.

852
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:22,129
How did Jack and Bill get roped into this?

853
01:14:23,426 --> 01:14:25,235
I went to them after.

854
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:29,473
First, I went to Jack.

855
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:33,613
He told me to get rid of the knife

856
01:14:34,437 --> 01:14:36,678
and to forget the whole thing.

857
01:14:38,341 --> 01:14:40,321
But then I went to Bill.

858
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,250
He told me to get a lawyer.

859
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:48,952
To confess.

860
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:51,998
To say that it was an act of self-defence.

861
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:59,439
The DA is asking for my deposition

862
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,135
in writing.

863
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,045
I can! do it.

864
01:15:06,135 --> 01:15:08,376
I don't know what I'm going to do.

865
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:13,115
I'm gonna be stuck in here
for the rest of my life.

866
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:23,888
Please don't leave me here.

867
01:15:39,235 --> 01:15:40,509
I'll do it.

868
01:15:44,807 --> 01:15:47,913
We're going to say
that it was an honour slaying.

869
01:15:53,816 --> 01:15:57,320
“Relating to a lethal attack committed

870
01:15:57,386 --> 01:16:01,926
“when the accused is defending himself
against a known homosexual,

871
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:06,663
"If the accused is heterosexual,

872
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:08,606
"he shall be pardoned.

873
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:13,578
"But if the accused is homosexual,

874
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:16,249
"the charge of murder in the first degree..."

875
01:16:21,844 --> 01:16:23,118
Dad?

876
01:16:25,448 --> 01:16:27,189
It's $5,000 bail.

877
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,590
I know. I know it's a lot.

878
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:33,565
No Kerouac was ever
wrapped up in a murder.

879
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:35,033
Go to hell!

880
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:43,573
Would you all just shut the hell up!

881
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:47,546
You must understand that David
has been following him for years.

882
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:52,245
When Lu went to Bowdoin,
David appeared out of thin air.

883
01:16:52,308 --> 01:16:53,810
So I sent him to Chicago.

884
01:16:54,577 --> 01:16:55,647
Surprise.

885
01:16:56,479 --> 01:16:58,390
David turned up there, too.

886
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:01,087
Then when Lucien wanted to go to Mexico,

887
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:05,262
guess who had a car idling in the driveway?

888
01:17:06,589 --> 01:17:08,660
But he didn't have to go with him.

889
01:17:09,892 --> 01:17:12,236
He spun a web to ensnare my son.

890
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:17,604
That's why I brought him here.

891
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:21,571
Lot of good that did.

892
01:17:27,776 --> 01:17:29,483
What happened in Chicago?

893
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,091
Thank God Lu has you in his life.

894
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:45,098
You know what, Allen?

895
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:49,340
He calls you his guardian angel.

896
01:17:53,102 --> 01:17:54,604
That's what he called David.

897
01:17:59,942 --> 01:18:01,615
That man ruined my son.

898
01:18:04,647 --> 01:18:07,628
You're gonna help me
keep what's left of him.

899
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:11,365
Contrary to reports,

900
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:15,492
prison is not a tonic for the spirit.

901
01:18:16,959 --> 01:18:20,964
All the district attorney cared about
was that David was queer.

902
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:23,539
And what did you tell him?

903
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:25,134
I said yes.

904
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:31,746
Did David do something to Lu in Chicago?

905
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:35,246
Christ, Allen, please don't get involved.

906
01:18:35,344 --> 01:18:36,846
I have to be.

907
01:18:37,413 --> 01:18:39,859
I'm helping him write his defence.

908
01:18:45,354 --> 01:18:47,231
David was my friend.

909
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:51,527
And he's dead.

910
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:55,198
And did Lucien tell you how he died?

911
01:18:57,866 --> 01:19:00,779
He might not have wanted you
to know, Allen.

912
01:19:03,539 --> 01:19:05,610
He tied David up.

913
01:19:12,181 --> 01:19:14,787
Put stones in his pockets
to weigh him down,

914
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,586
and then dragged him into the Hudson.

915
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:18,926
What?

916
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:21,592
He was alive, Allen,

917
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:24,364
until Lucien made him drown.

918
01:19:27,196 --> 01:19:29,733
Who are you? Is he part of this business?

919
01:19:29,898 --> 01:19:31,468
Leave him alone, Dad.

920
01:19:31,567 --> 01:19:33,945
I paid your bail.

921
01:19:34,036 --> 01:19:36,141
Don't talk to me like that.

922
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:38,209
YES, sir.

923
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,750
The car leaves in five minutes.

924
01:19:52,421 --> 01:19:57,666
The libertine circle has come to an end.

925
01:20:03,232 --> 01:20:05,234
Go back to the beginning.

926
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:31,523
"Cook's County Hospital of Chicago."

927
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:48,214
"David Kammerer."

928
01:23:12,421 --> 01:23:14,458
He would leave me alone in the house.

929
01:23:15,257 --> 01:23:17,294
- I was gonna die there.
- No, you weren't.

930
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:20,272
- Yeah, I know it.
- No, Mom. Stop.

931
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:25,772
Hey. I'm okay now.

932
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:28,941
I'm your mother and I'm okay.

933
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:33,944
But you're not.

934
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,453
I'm in over my head.

935
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:44,722
Someone I know killed a man.

936
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:48,391
And...

937
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:51,403
I don't know what to do.

938
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:53,973
He wants my help
and I don't know if I should give it to him.

939
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:56,009
I don't know if ifs right.

940
01:23:58,834 --> 01:24:00,142
It's just a mess.

941
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:03,073
You let him go.

942
01:24:04,573 --> 01:24:06,211
- What?
- Don't help him.

943
01:24:06,308 --> 01:24:09,687
- I can't, Mom. He's my best friend.
- Listen to me.

944
01:24:11,513 --> 01:24:15,154
The most important thing
your father ever did was fail me.

945
01:24:16,485 --> 01:24:18,021
You understand?

946
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:52,888
He loved you.

947
01:24:53,956 --> 01:24:56,562
And the truth is, once,

948
01:24:57,626 --> 01:24:59,128
you loved him back.

949
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:05,610
- What about what I need?
- But the secret ate away at you.

950
01:25:05,901 --> 01:25:09,815
I was a kid, and you dragged me
into your perverted mess.

951
01:25:09,905 --> 01:25:12,442
<i>So in Chicago, you tried to kill yourself</i>

952
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:15,044
How can you say that?
You know that's not true.

953
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:16,555
He rescued you.

954
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:18,983
I will never give up on us.

955
01:25:19,381 --> 01:25:21,122
He saved your life.

956
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:23,388
You're pathetic.

957
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:37,069
You needed him as much as he needed you.

958
01:25:46,008 --> 01:25:47,988
Now I know how you felt.

959
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:51,252
When?

960
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:57,127
When you wanted to die.

961
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:05,932
Do it.

962
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:16,546
Do it.

963
01:26:55,811 --> 01:26:57,154
Some things,

964
01:26:59,514 --> 01:27:01,391
once you've loved them,

965
01:27:02,818 --> 01:27:04,923
become yours forever.

966
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:11,000
And if you try to let them go

967
01:27:13,862 --> 01:27:17,400
they only circle back and return to you.

968
01:27:18,834 --> 01:27:21,212
They become part of who you are.

969
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,120
"Or they destroy you."

970
01:27:37,352 --> 01:27:38,797
You can't show this to anyone.

971
01:27:38,887 --> 01:27:41,390
- Then tell the truth, Lu.
- You weren't even there.

972
01:27:41,456 --> 01:27:43,197
It's your truth. It's fiction.

973
01:27:48,196 --> 01:27:51,268
You wanted him gone, too.
You sent him to me.

974
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:56,779
Please. You'll kill me with that.

975
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:58,144
Allen. No.

976
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,720
Allen! Don't. No!

977
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:02,247
Don't!

978
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:21,938
Allen Ginsberg.

979
01:28:21,997 --> 01:28:24,739
He'll be with you in a minute.
Please have a seat.

980
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:37,472
Mr Ginsberg, he's ready for you.

981
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:41,343
Mr Ginsberg?

982
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:47,921
How did you expect us to react to this?

983
01:29:54,522 --> 01:29:56,502
No, please, tell me.

984
01:29:57,192 --> 01:30:01,004
Professor Steeves says that you
submitted it as your final.

985
01:30:03,865 --> 01:30:06,004
Well, then let me tell you.

986
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:09,514
It's smutty and it's absurd.

987
01:30:11,506 --> 01:30:13,008
But you finished it.

988
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:22,052
You have taken incompletes in two classes
and you are on academic probation.

989
01:30:22,117 --> 01:30:26,532
There are rules that you agreed to
upon acceptance into this university

990
01:30:26,588 --> 01:30:30,627
and you managed to break
and you just keep breaking them.

991
01:30:30,725 --> 01:30:34,468
You don't seem to have much respect
for this institution.

992
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:38,101
So, you may either

993
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:43,239
retract this fiction as your final
or you may choose to be expelled.

994
01:30:44,372 --> 01:30:45,578
What will it be?

995
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:56,220
Fine.

996
01:30:59,321 --> 01:31:00,925
Consider me expelled.

997
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:05,997
No, this remains with us.

998
01:31:30,585 --> 01:31:34,533
World News Today,
brought to you by Hasbro Corporation.

999
01:31:34,622 --> 01:31:35,657
This came for you.

1000
01:31:35,757 --> 01:31:40,001
“Exhibitors, dealers all over America
and in many foreign lands.

1001
01:31:40,095 --> 01:31:43,508
By shortwave broadcast
direct to important overseas stations

1002
01:31:43,598 --> 01:31:46,010
and leading newscasts of our own country,

1003
01:31:46,101 --> 01:31:51,949
CBS reporters witnessing firsthand news
of the world's political and...

1004
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:05,624
Survivors have assembled
in the streets in celebration.

1005
01:32:06,654 --> 01:32:09,658
This is the end of a long darkness.

1006
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:13,534
France and Europe are finally free.

1007
01:32:31,479 --> 01:32:34,323
Another lover hits the universe.

1008
01:32:38,686 --> 01:32:40,723
The circle is broken.

1009
01:32:43,691 --> 01:32:47,161
But with death comes rebirth.

1010
01:32:57,072 --> 01:33:01,020
And like all lovers and sad people,

1011
01:33:05,847 --> 01:33:07,349
I am a poet.
