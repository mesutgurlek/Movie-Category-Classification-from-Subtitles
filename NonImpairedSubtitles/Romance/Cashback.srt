1
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:03,067
it takes approximately 500
pounds to crush a human skull.

2
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:07,434
but the human emotion
is a much more delicate thing.

3
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:24,133
take suzy,
my first real girlfriend.

4
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,434
my first real breakup,

5
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:28,601
happening right in front of me.

6
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:32,334
i never thought it was going
to be similar to car crash.

7
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,133
i've slammed the brakes,

8
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,200
and i'm skidding towards
an emotional impact.

9
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:42,000
so is this all my fault?

10
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:45,801
me. ben willis.

11
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:53,467
it's funny what goes through
your mind at a time like this.

12
00:01:53,534 --> 00:01:57,033
the two-and-a-half years
we spent together.

13
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:01,100
the promises we made.

14
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:08,234
the holidays we took
with her parents.

15
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:13,200
the lamp we bought
at ikea together.

16
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:22,100
it was my final year
at art college.

17
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,767
and in the weeks that
followed the breakup,

18
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:26,501
i tried to figure out
what went wrong.

19
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:28,901
why did we break up?

20
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:33,334
it's funny, but when i think back now the reason seems so small.

21
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,734
one day she's with me,
and she's saying "i love you, "

22
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:40,033
and the next week
she's with someone else.

23
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,601
probably saying
the same thing.

24
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,501
so did she
really love me?

25
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:47,767
what is love anyway?

26
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,834
and is it really
that fleeting?

27
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:56,200
forget about her. you don't wanna waste your time

28
00:02:56,267 --> 00:03:00,000
thinking about a girl that dumped you for a loser like steve jenkins.

29
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:03,000
she didn't dump me.

30
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:05,367
why did she
chuck you anyway?

31
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:08,367
it ended

32
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:11,434
'cause suzy thinks the grass is always greener on the other side.

33
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:15,400
she's always worrying about there being a better party to go to.

34
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:19,000
or a better boyfriend
to be had.

35
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:21,901
i just felt i could
never make her happy.

36
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:28,601
and then steve jenkins
started texting her.

37
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,734
how did steve jenkins
get her number?

38
00:03:31,801 --> 00:03:33,667
it was a good point.

39
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:36,467
i only imagined the worst.

40
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:40,267
i don't want
to think about it.

41
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:42,934
you need to go out with a beautiful girl. a model or something.

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,667
why?

43
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:47,434
well, because if you've got
a beautiful girl on your arm,

44
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:49,200
then you must
be worth having.

45
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:51,367
women are in competition
with each other, you see.

46
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:54,100
suzy sees you with a sexy baby,
she'll think to herself

47
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,167
"if i can get ben back
from that beautiful girl,

48
00:03:56,234 --> 00:03:57,801
then i must be more
beautiful than her. "

49
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:01,934
sean's success with women
was pretty impressive.

50
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:09,501
it's true.
ask your mom.

51
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:15,734
the age-old question.
what is love?

52
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:18,968
excuse me.

53
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:29,167
that's good. that's perfect.

54
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:04,868
ben, mr. adams here
has given his time up for you.

55
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:08,801
don't you think we should show him a little bit of respect?

56
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,634
excuse me.

57
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:29,234
i live in student accommodation
not far from the college.

58
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,901
it's basically
a four-story concrete block

59
00:05:31,968 --> 00:05:36,033
housing some 120
hormone-crazed students.

60
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:45,734
this is the haunting period.

61
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:49,534
the time when the demons
of regret come for you.

62
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:53,701
she stood right there

63
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:56,734
when i said those words:

64
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:58,100
"i'm sorry.

65
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,868
"i don't think
i can make you happy.

66
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:02,834
maybe we should break up. "

67
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:06,734
and that's when
she got angry.

68
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:32,000
hello?

69
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:36,801
suzy, it's me, ben.

70
00:06:36,868 --> 00:06:40,734
ben! i was asleep.
what is it?

71
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,567
suzy, um...

72
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:48,667
i'm sorry.

73
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:50,868
i'm sorry too.

74
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:58,968
do you think there's any chance
we'll get back together?

75
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:01,968
i don't think so, ben.

76
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:05,734
i think it ran its course.

77
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,901
besides,
i'm with steve now.

78
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:13,968
have you
slept with him?

79
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,767
yes.

80
00:07:20,434 --> 00:07:23,067
was it good?
i mean, is it better than...

81
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:26,367
i don't wanna talk
about it with you, ben.

82
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:29,801
i've gotta go.
sorry, ben.

83
00:07:29,868 --> 00:07:32,367
- suzy?
-

84
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,234
to think about her now
with someone else,

85
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,234
it felt like all the oxygen
had been sucked from the room.

86
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:32,367
after my breakup with suzy, i just couldn't fall asleep anymore.

87
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:36,567
the more i tried to sleep,
the less tired i felt.

88
00:10:36,634 --> 00:10:39,234
i was wide awake.

89
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,934
i tried everything.

90
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,434
i'd just become
immune to sleep.

91
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:50,200
i suddenly found
i had eight extra hours.

92
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,334
my life had been
extended by a third.

93
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,000
i wanted time to pass quickly, but instead i was forced to witness

94
00:10:58,067 --> 00:11:01,000
the passing of every
second of every hour.

95
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:05,934
i wanted the hurt i felt
to go away.

96
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,534
but in some cruel trick
of events,

97
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,167
i now had even more time
on my hands.

98
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:14,767
more time
to think about suzy.

99
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:17,934
would you mind getting out?
just checking that wheel?

100
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,334
i took the bus
with no real place to go.

101
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,400
i watched the landscape slowly change as it clung to the last hours of sunlight,

102
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,667
before leaving me to get
another sleepless night.

103
00:11:57,701 --> 00:12:01,534
i started to read all the books
i wished i'd had time to read.

104
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:05,534
with the extra hours, i even had time to reread my favorite ones.

105
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:19,334
but she was never far
from my mind.

106
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:44,567
two pounds 75, please.

107
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:55,200
ah, how much is it
without these two?

108
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:03,701
one pound 70.

109
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:15,267
it was getting obvious that i
needed to trade some of my time.

110
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:24,000
yeah, yeah, yeah.

111
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:27,334
yeah, yeah.

112
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,000
yeah. yeah.

113
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:33,901
mmm, mmm, mmm.
it all looks fantastic, man.

114
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:37,434
i think you'll fit in
very well here.

115
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:42,567
it's a great
feeling inside, ben.

116
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:47,367
it's marvelous. we hope
you've enjoyed reading about

117
00:14:47,434 --> 00:14:49,767
what it's like to be part
of sainsbury's and listening.

118
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:51,567
i know, i've been
through this with you.

119
00:14:51,634 --> 00:14:56,234
there's so many opportunities, ben. it's a life thing.

120
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:05,934
i could feel a faint shift
in a faraway place.

121
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:11,701
a current of unknown
consequences was on its way

122
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:16,267
moving towards me like
an unstoppable wave of fate.

123
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:22,133
t-e-a-m-w-o-r-k. work.

124
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,234
teamwork, ben.

125
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,267
welcome aboard.

126
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:49,834
and so i started working
the night shift at sainsbury's.

127
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:54,334
during the hours most
normal people are sleeping,

128
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,901
i'm busy trading my time.

129
00:15:56,968 --> 00:16:01,167
i give them my extra eight hours, and they give me money. cash back.

130
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,701
- hi.
- oh, hi.

131
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:16,100
i'm late again. jenkins is gonna kill me. see you later.

132
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:17,767
yeah, see ya.

133
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:21,033
- sharon!
- yes, mr. jenkins?

134
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,200
- late again, sharon.
- i'm sorry, mr. jenkins.

135
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:25,701
- second time this week.
- i know, mr. jenkins.

136
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:28,467
i'm sorry,
it won't happen again.

137
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:29,267
okay.

138
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,634
my first year at art college
was boring to say the least.

139
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:46,701
but it helped me to appreciate
the fundamentals of still life.

140
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:49,567
i'd like to remind the customers
that there's a special

141
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:53,033
two for the price of one
offer on aisle ten.

142
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,868
fresh bread and cakes. that's aisle ten for a special two for the price of one offer.

143
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:03,934
well, don't just
stare at it, ben!

144
00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:06,767
clean it up.

145
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:17,267
you see, i've always
wanted to be a painter.

146
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:19,567
and like many artists
before me,

147
00:17:19,634 --> 00:17:22,534
the female form has always been
a great source of inspiration.

148
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:31,868
i've always been in awe of the power they unknowingly possess.

149
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,200
now, are you going
to clean them up or not?

150
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:50,601
there is an art to dealing with the boredom of an eight-hour shift.

151
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:54,334
an art to putting your mind somewhere else while the seconds slowly tick away.

152
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,167
i found that all
the people working here

153
00:17:57,234 --> 00:17:59,934
had perfected
their own individual art.

154
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,033
take sharon pintey.

155
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,667
sharon knows rule number one.
the clock is the enemy.

156
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:07,701
the basic rule is this:

157
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:11,968
the more you look at the clock,
the slower the time goes.

158
00:18:17,968 --> 00:18:19,901
it will uncover
the hiding place of your mind

159
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:22,701
and torture it
with every second.

160
00:18:28,033 --> 00:18:31,167
this is the basic art in dealing with the trade of your time.

161
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:37,801
any cash back?

162
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,200
this is barry brickman.

163
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:02,667
you see, barry thinks of himself as a bit of a daredevil stuntman.

164
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,901
for a start,
barry is quite well-known.

165
00:19:07,968 --> 00:19:10,234
when one of barry's
bike tricks went wrong,

166
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,367
the cameraman put it
on the internet.

167
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:16,267
barry has stuck
to his scooter ever since.

168
00:19:18,934 --> 00:19:20,934
matt stephens is also
a king scooterer.

169
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:29,100
and what was
the other thing?

170
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:36,868
and what was
the other thing?

171
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:40,634
- sausage!
- oh, yeah.

172
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:46,267
now barry and matt
are good friends.

173
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:48,334
there you go.
take care.

174
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,067
between them, they have come
up with a very different way

175
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:53,901
of dealing with
the trade of their time.

176
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:55,634
look. look.

177
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,834
theirs is an art to finding anything to do that isn't work.

178
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:13,734
a few days later,
barry and matt were reported

179
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:17,400
for what they called
"helping the ladies. "

180
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,300
it was these shampoo bottles
that sent them on their quest.

181
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:24,367
barry and matt knew
what they looked like.

182
00:20:24,434 --> 00:20:27,367
and they knew that the women in the supermarket knew what they looked like.

183
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,167
their theory was that even
though it was a sex toy

184
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:31,834
masquerading as
a bottle of shampoo,

185
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:34,000
women would like
to try it as a sex toy

186
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,501
but were embarrassed to buy it because they knew what it looked like.

187
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:42,601
the decision to buy it would be an easier one if they were already at the checkout.

188
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:45,067
if they didn't object,
then barry and matt knew

189
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:48,767
they'd helped a bottle
find a happy home.

190
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:54,934
barry had challenged matt
to a scooter race

191
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,434
in which they would sprint
down one aisle and up the next.

192
00:20:57,501 --> 00:21:00,400
they would do all 14 aisles, and then back to the starting line.

193
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,868
they had been waiting for the day the manager called in sick.

194
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:08,934
the art of doing something else other than the work you're supposed to do, is addictive.

195
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
the excitement of doing something that you shouldn't be doing,

196
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:13,234
along with the consequences
if you're caught doing it,

197
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,434
are so strong that it often pulls others away from their own art.

198
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:20,534
on your marks,
get set, go!

199
00:21:28,868 --> 00:21:30,501
we got winded!

200
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:43,400
i hadn't slept in two weeks.

201
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:52,601
my breakup with suzy had left me with a sense that time had become unhinged.

202
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:55,467
i drifted between
imagination and reality,

203
00:21:55,534 --> 00:21:58,100
between past and present
with increasing ease.

204
00:22:00,434 --> 00:22:03,300
i feel like a real man.
you like men.

205
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:04,767
you like real men,
don't you?

206
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:06,934
when i'm out there
in the kit,

207
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,968
on the pitch
with the boys,

208
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:13,501
i look like a god,
i'm an adonis.

209
00:22:26,534 --> 00:22:30,100
i keep myself
in good shape.

210
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:34,601
i see the looks.
i ignore them.

211
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:38,167
i feel the bolts of time slowly
coming away from the breakup.

212
00:22:38,234 --> 00:22:40,934
time manipulation
is not a precise science.

213
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,033
like any art,
it's personal to the individual.

214
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,567
so what is the art in making
my shift go so fast?

215
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:54,400
i imagine the opposite.

216
00:22:54,467 --> 00:22:57,334
that time is frozen.

217
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,701
i imagine the remote control
for life has been paused.

218
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:37,901
within this frozen world, i'm able to walk freely and unnoticed.

219
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,000
nobody would even know
that time had stopped.

220
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,100
and when it started
back up again,

221
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:56,501
the invisible join would be seamless except for a slight shudder.

222
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:01,000
not unlike the feeling of somebody walking over your grave.

223
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:16,934
that moment when you see someone
walking down the street

224
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,100
who is so beautiful
you just can't help but stare...

225
00:24:22,534 --> 00:24:25,501
well, imagine as i do,
that with the world on pause

226
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:28,434
it becomes very easy to understand the concept of beauty.

227
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:32,067
to have it frozen
in front of you.

228
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:33,334
captured.

229
00:24:35,868 --> 00:24:37,100
unaware.

230
00:24:48,334 --> 00:24:51,834
for me, this fascination with beauty started at a very young age.

231
00:24:51,901 --> 00:24:56,200
i was six or seven, and my mom and dad had taken on a foreign student.

232
00:24:56,267 --> 00:24:57,801
she was in her late teens,

233
00:24:57,868 --> 00:25:00,601
and was studying english
at a nearby school.

234
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:04,734
being swedish, the walk from the shower to her room didn't need to be a modest one.

235
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:11,834
it was at that moment that something very profound happened to me.

236
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:16,801
i was exposed to the female form in a way i had never experienced.

237
00:25:16,868 --> 00:25:21,334
i felt fascination and wonder
at the beauty of her nakedness.

238
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,868
and i wanted to freeze the world so that i could live in that moment for a week.

239
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:30,434
i have never had a feeling
of such completeness.

240
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:33,701
to this day i still think it was one of the most beautiful things i have ever seen.

241
00:25:51,234 --> 00:25:52,801
you dropped these.

242
00:26:12,534 --> 00:26:15,100
and would it be wrong?

243
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:17,868
would they hate me
for seeing them?

244
00:26:17,934 --> 00:26:20,100
i mean, really seeing them?

245
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:29,767
i read once about a woman whose secret fantasy was to have an affair with an artist.

246
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:34,667
she thought that he
would really see her.

247
00:26:34,734 --> 00:26:37,000
he would see every curve,

248
00:26:37,067 --> 00:26:40,667
every line,
every indentation,

249
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:44,200
and love them because they were part of the beauty that made her unique.

250
00:28:57,701 --> 00:29:00,734
and when i'm ready, all i have to do to start time again

251
00:29:00,801 --> 00:29:03,267
is crack my fingers.

252
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,534
you look like shit.

253
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:16,000
cheers.

254
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:25,467
- still not sleeping?
- no.

255
00:29:25,534 --> 00:29:27,701
- feeling any better about suzy? - no.

256
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,300
- wanna talk about it?
- no.

257
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:30,834
no? why?

258
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:32,701
because every morning
you come by,

259
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:35,367
and every morning i talk
about the same thing.

260
00:29:35,434 --> 00:29:38,968
and i'm bored of saying the same thing, and i'm bored of feeling shit about it.

261
00:29:39,033 --> 00:29:41,868
and most of all i'm bored of
being awake 24 hours a day.

262
00:29:41,934 --> 00:29:45,133
eew! look who didn't get out of bed on the wrong side this morning.

263
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,767
very funny.

264
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:50,701
but seriously, you're gonna feel like shit. it's gonna take time.

265
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:53,567
for instance, how long ago
did you think about her

266
00:29:53,634 --> 00:29:55,367
before we started having
this conversation?

267
00:29:55,434 --> 00:29:57,734
about ten minutes before
you knocked on the door.

268
00:29:57,801 --> 00:30:00,701
oh, yeah.
and what was the thought?

269
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:09,567
i thought about the dust.

270
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:13,501
the dust?
god, you're weird!

271
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:16,767
anyway, whatever. my point is, every day you think about her

272
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:19,501
and the things that you associate with her less and less.

273
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,834
before long, you'll go a whole day without thinking about her.

274
00:30:21,901 --> 00:30:23,834
you know what might help
speed up the process?

275
00:30:23,901 --> 00:30:25,167
what?

276
00:30:32,534 --> 00:30:35,901
me and sean had been friends
since we were five.

277
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:39,300
we lived across the street from one another, and grew up together.

278
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:41,534
for his 12th birthday,
sean's mom and dad

279
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:44,033
had bought him
a state-of the-art computer.

280
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,033
oh, mom!

281
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,400
come on, boys, it's a nice day.
why don't you play in the park?

282
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:53,801
no. we're okay
playing this.

283
00:30:57,067 --> 00:31:00,834
okay, i'm off shopping. you be all right by yourselves?

284
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,501
yes, mom. bye, mom.

285
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:05,634
bye, mrs. higgins.

286
00:31:05,701 --> 00:31:08,067
i won't be long.

287
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,934
- wanna see something?
- what?

288
00:31:26,434 --> 00:31:30,100
- what are they?
- girls with no clothes on.

289
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:34,567
sean had found the magazines under his mom and dad's bed.

290
00:31:34,634 --> 00:31:38,234
the swedish student was one thing, but this was something completely different.

291
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,667
the smiles on the girls' faces
and the total lack of shyness

292
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:45,234
about what they were showing the camera was so confusing for me.

293
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:50,000
i had never seen the female part
up close and in so much detail.

294
00:31:50,067 --> 00:31:52,801
i guess i imagined
something neater,

295
00:31:52,868 --> 00:31:56,167
like a smooth hole
drilled into a piece of wood.

296
00:31:56,234 --> 00:31:58,834
the sort of hole where
you might place a wooden peg.

297
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:02,501
but the reality was much more
sexually aggressive.

298
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:05,067
it was hard to imagine
that my teacher, mrs. booth,

299
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:08,701
had one under her skirt
that looked just like it.

300
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:10,734
- 
- mom!

301
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,968
forgot my purse.

302
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,567
hey, what have
you two been up to?

303
00:32:25,801 --> 00:32:28,367
after that, sean's mom
always thought we were gay.

304
00:32:30,801 --> 00:32:33,501
what will help speed up
the process?

305
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:36,200
you need to distract yourself
with a couple of natalies.

306
00:32:39,634 --> 00:32:43,601
a natalie was a term that sean had coined for any sexual encounter

307
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:46,400
that happened with a girl you
weren't in a relationship with.

308
00:32:55,801 --> 00:33:00,334
the term had come from a girl called natalie who lived across the street from sean.

309
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,367
- hello. is natalie in?
- yeah. natalie!

310
00:33:05,434 --> 00:33:07,400
- yeah?
- it's for you.

311
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:09,434
you see, sean had
worked out the connection

312
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:12,534
between the smiling faces
of the girls in the magazines

313
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:15,534
and the fact that
they were naked.

314
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:38,934
fifty p.

315
00:33:59,067 --> 00:34:00,868
that's it.

316
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:08,601
natalie became one of the most popular girls on the street.

317
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,000
croissants on special offer.

318
00:34:34,734 --> 00:34:36,801
she had
massive tits.

319
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:42,167
very funny.

320
00:34:42,234 --> 00:34:44,234
we were only
having a laugh.

321
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:47,868
who's that?

322
00:34:47,934 --> 00:34:50,100
that's a new kid.

323
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:53,400
apparently he's
a martial arts expert.

324
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,934
hey, mate!

325
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,367
come here.

326
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:07,100
what's your name?

327
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:09,300
brian.

328
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:11,701
ben says you know
kung fu.

329
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:14,133
yeah.

330
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,701
- so you reckon you can have me?
- yeah.

331
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:20,267
- oh, yeah?
- yeah.

332
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:23,234
show us your moves then.

333
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:39,601
grab my arm.

334
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:49,467
that's not funny.

335
00:35:53,868 --> 00:35:54,868
hi.

336
00:35:54,934 --> 00:35:56,434
hi, ben.

337
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,467
you're not
working tonight?

338
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:03,300
no, i swapped
two hours this week.

339
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,267
is that a pickle sandwich?

340
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:10,267
oh, ah, yeah.

341
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,968
could i have a bite?
i'm starving.

342
00:36:17,501 --> 00:36:20,534
mmm. thanks.

343
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:26,234
- what?
- you got some there.

344
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
- mmm.
- there.

345
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,567
let me.

346
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:42,367
thanks.

347
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:52,100
i wanted to freeze time.

348
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:01,133
i wanted to savor
that moment.

349
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:07,567
to live in that moment
for a week.

350
00:37:07,634 --> 00:37:09,868
but i couldn't stop it.

351
00:37:09,934 --> 00:37:12,601
only slow it.

352
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,734
and before i knew it,
she was gone.

353
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:23,734
after the door closed, i felt like the last person on earth.

354
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,334
what are you doing?

355
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,434
- jenkins wanted us to go and fill the shelves. - so here we are.

356
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:50,367
iiiieeee.

357
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,834
take no notice of him. he's love struck. he asked sharon out today.

358
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,000
you did?
what did she say?

359
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,601
she said "yes. "
he's taking her

360
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,367
to the pictures
tomorrow night.

361
00:38:02,434 --> 00:38:08,033
then it's back to mine. i'll need about half an hour to talk away me face.

362
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,901
and then, she's gonna
get some of this.

363
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,701
crush.

364
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:20,100
it's funny how the same word
for the feeling of attraction

365
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:22,501
can be used for the feeling
of disappointment.

366
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:26,434
the oxford english dictionary states one of the meanings for the word crushed

367
00:38:26,501 --> 00:38:30,467
as "a strong and unreasoning,
but transitory attachment. "

368
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:35,334
i had three crushes
when i was young.

369
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,601
the first was an athlete
called zola budd.

370
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:42,033
she was 18, and looked like a tomboy with a small, slender frame.

371
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,400
but it was the fact that zola budd defiantly ran barefoot

372
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:48,100
that made her so completely
attractive for me.

373
00:38:50,067 --> 00:38:54,067
it was the los angeles olympics
that would go down in history.

374
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:59,434
in the 3,000 meter race, zola budd clashed with the american, mary decker.

375
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:02,400
budd's heart for the race
was left where decker fell.

376
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,634
zola finished seventh.

377
00:39:06,701 --> 00:39:09,834
ben, it's time for bed now.
you've got school tomorrow.

378
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:12,267
well, well.
what an upset.

379
00:39:12,334 --> 00:39:16,601
can somebody tell me something about the white blood cells? tim?

380
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:20,767
uh, they help fight off bacteria
and germs in the body.

381
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:22,534
very well done.

382
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:24,067
types...

383
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:28,367
of cells.

384
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:32,701
the second crush was for
my biology teacher, mrs. booth.

385
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:36,634
okay, class, who can tell me
something about cells?

386
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:39,567
she was a confident woman
whose figure-hugging outfits

387
00:39:39,634 --> 00:39:42,133
hinted at the sexiness
that lay hidden beneath.

388
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,100
i imagined mrs. booth asking me
to stay behind after school

389
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:48,868
and showing me the same
thing under her skirt

390
00:39:48,934 --> 00:39:52,400
as the girls i'd seen
in the magazines with sean.

391
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:55,968
but the main crush i had was with a girl called tanya green.

392
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,267
when i looked at tanya, i didn't just see her, i felt her.

393
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:05,934
the white blood cells and
red blood cells work together.

394
00:40:20,234 --> 00:40:21,934
oy!

395
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,701
the next day, tanya caused a
lot of excitement in the class.

396
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:38,334
tanya had broken her arm
falling from a swing,

397
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,901
and her cast had caused much excitement amongst the other kids at the school.

398
00:40:40,968 --> 00:40:43,968
settle down now,
please, class.

399
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:46,200
that's enough.

400
00:40:46,267 --> 00:40:48,467
but i saw it
differently.

401
00:40:48,534 --> 00:40:50,534
it was the way
tanya dealt with it.

402
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:55,067
the way she
scratched an itch.

403
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:59,267
the way it restricted
her movements.

404
00:41:01,133 --> 00:41:05,133
the increasing amount of graffiti that appeared on it during its six-week life span.

405
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,701
would you like
to sign it?

406
00:41:14,634 --> 00:41:16,701
just here.

407
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:22,901
thanks.

408
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,501
go away!
stop it!

409
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,901
on the day the cast
finally came off,

410
00:41:36,968 --> 00:41:38,567
tanya's arm
was covered in hair.

411
00:41:38,634 --> 00:41:40,400
go on back to the jungle.

412
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:46,968
the six weeks without light had caused the hair to grow thick and black.

413
00:41:47,033 --> 00:41:50,000
but while the other kids joked
and called her "monkey, "

414
00:41:50,067 --> 00:41:52,734
it only heightened
my fascination for her.

415
00:41:58,033 --> 00:41:59,400
don't cry.

416
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:03,467
you don't have to
worry about them.

417
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:05,534
i think you're beautiful
the way you are.

418
00:42:09,868 --> 00:42:12,767
will you be
my girlfriend?

419
00:42:14,234 --> 00:42:15,167
yes.

420
00:42:18,901 --> 00:42:21,300
there was a place that
i often went to by myself.

421
00:42:22,634 --> 00:42:24,868
it was just
behind the school.

422
00:42:24,934 --> 00:42:28,934
it was close enough to still hear the screams and shouts of the kids playing their games.

423
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,634
but at the same time,
it felt hidden away from them.

424
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,767
i had arranged
to meet tanya there.

425
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,300
whatcha?

426
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:47,234
whatcha?

427
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,534
you wanna kiss me?

428
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:06,434
so this was to be
my first kiss.

429
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,501
yeah.

430
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,534
hey! where you going?

431
00:43:15,767 --> 00:43:18,567
i gotta go.
i'll kiss you tomorrow.

432
00:43:18,634 --> 00:43:23,000
- but tomorrow's saturday.
- meet me here at 11:00.

433
00:43:29,434 --> 00:43:32,934
i often came to play around the
school grounds on a saturday.

434
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,167
the familiar building,
so unfamiliar in its quietness.

435
00:43:37,234 --> 00:43:40,300
peaceful, as if time
had frozen still.

436
00:43:54,234 --> 00:43:57,467
it's like the walls
of this room.

437
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:59,767
it keeps the whole
building standing.

438
00:43:59,834 --> 00:44:04,501
tanya's parents had taken her on a surprise holiday to america.

439
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:07,300
they set up home there,
and never returned.

440
00:44:07,367 --> 00:44:11,734
it was the first time my heart felt the other meaning of crush.

441
00:44:20,467 --> 00:44:22,567
checkmate.

442
00:44:22,634 --> 00:44:26,300
what's wrong with you? you normally kick my arse at chess.

443
00:44:26,367 --> 00:44:28,868
have you met someone?

444
00:44:31,033 --> 00:44:33,100
well, come on.
give me the juice.

445
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:36,901
no, it's nothing really. just a girl at work i think is nice.

446
00:44:36,968 --> 00:44:40,300
nice? nice what?
nice rack?

447
00:44:40,367 --> 00:44:42,634
no.

448
00:44:42,701 --> 00:44:44,434
well, yeah,
but nothing like that.

449
00:44:44,501 --> 00:44:48,334
what?
girlfriend material?

450
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,734
she got small hands?

451
00:44:50,801 --> 00:44:53,801
- what's that got to do with anything? - makes your willy look big.

452
00:44:53,868 --> 00:44:56,067
you're such a loser.

453
00:44:56,133 --> 00:44:57,767
so have you asked her out?

454
00:44:57,834 --> 00:45:01,167
- no. someone already beat me to it. - ahh, she got a boyfriend.

455
00:45:01,234 --> 00:45:04,000
no, but one of the guys at work
asked her out. she said "yes. "

456
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:06,234
they're going
to the pictures tonight.

457
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,467
that doesn't mean
she fancies him.

458
00:45:08,534 --> 00:45:12,901
she might just like him, and want someone to go to pictures with.

459
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:17,734
how many girls have you taken to the pictures and then snogged?

460
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,601
- oh, yeah!
-

461
00:45:29,834 --> 00:45:33,334
- 
- what?

462
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:36,601
quite a few.

463
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,834
there you go.

464
00:45:43,968 --> 00:45:45,400
can i have that?

465
00:45:49,501 --> 00:45:52,634
yeah, yeah,
that's right, rory.

466
00:45:52,701 --> 00:45:57,167
well, of course i played professionally, before the injury.

467
00:45:57,234 --> 00:45:58,734
any day, rory.

468
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:03,067
you name the date,
me and my boys'll be there.

469
00:46:03,133 --> 00:46:06,300

474
00:46:25,467 --> 00:46:27,868
2,000 feet jump.

475
00:46:27,934 --> 00:46:31,133

3,000, kill ya.

476

00:46:53,501 --> 00:46:55,133

478
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,534

479
00:46:57,601 --> 00:47:00,234
of course i did.
she loved it.

480
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:05,467
couldn't get enough of it. she went like the toilet door on a bombay shrimp trawler.

481
00:47:05,534 --> 00:47:07,634
- rack?
- well, put it this way.

482
00:47:07,701 --> 00:47:10,133
at least you know your kids
will never go hungry.

483
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,467
and?

484
00:47:12,534 --> 00:47:14,667
like an artist's pocket.

485
00:47:18,367 --> 00:47:21,133
okay, champs.
rory brown.

486
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,267
manager of
sainsbury's, islington,

487
00:47:23,334 --> 00:47:26,801
has challenged us to a football match on sunday night.

488
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,868
finished?

489
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:32,601
good.

490
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:35,667
the reputation of
this supermarket is at stake.

491
00:47:35,734 --> 00:47:40,000
your reputations, as employees, are at stake.

492
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:43,501
this is not just
a game of football.

493
00:47:43,567 --> 00:47:47,033
this is what it means to
be a modern-day gladiator!

494
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:52,234
now, i want you to think of me
as russell crowe.

495
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,667
and you, you're all
the other slaves.

496
00:47:55,734 --> 00:48:00,167
and as slaves,
you will play to the death!

497
00:48:00,234 --> 00:48:04,901
for what happens on sunday night, will echo through eternity.

498
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:14,300
sunday. 8:00 p. m.
sunny sports center.

499
00:48:27,434 --> 00:48:30,601
you have got to got
to be joking, right?

500
00:48:33,033 --> 00:48:35,234
we're gonna get murdered.

501
00:48:38,601 --> 00:48:40,734
aaah!

502
00:48:46,267 --> 00:48:47,834
- hi.
-  all right.

503
00:48:48,834 --> 00:48:50,834

504
00:48:50,901 --> 00:48:54,400

505
00:48:54,467 --> 00:48:55,767

506
00:48:59,834 --> 00:49:03,033
gather round, whitechapel.
whitechapel, gather round.

507
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,467
okay, chaps, this is it!

508
00:49:06,534 --> 00:49:09,601
that is islington sainsbury's
over there.

509
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:14,434
all i can see are
a lot of pretty uniforms.

510
00:49:14,501 --> 00:49:16,801
take a good look
at one another.

511
00:49:16,868 --> 00:49:19,534
why?

512
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:22,634
natural-born killers!
every one of you!

513
00:49:22,701 --> 00:49:27,133
so let's get stuck in there
and settle this! huh? huh?

514
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,067

515
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,133
hey, barry, i've got
this really great game.

516
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,634
all right, rory.

517
00:49:44,701 --> 00:49:46,367
jenkins.

518
00:49:46,434 --> 00:49:49,567
there's some pretty
uniforms you boys got.

519
00:49:49,634 --> 00:49:53,267
see you've brought
your top team this time.

520
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,367
looks can be deceiving.

521
00:49:59,434 --> 00:50:03,534
- well, that's obvious.
- what?

522
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:06,968
right. call.

523
00:50:07,033 --> 00:50:09,334
heads.
no, tails.

524
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,901
tails it is.

525
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:16,000
come along!

526
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,634

531
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,434
come on, after it.

532
00:51:04,701 --> 00:51:10,467
i'm playing! i'm playing! the safe keys are hanging off, on the top shelf!

533
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:13,467
get it! get it!

534
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,634

00:51:33,634 --> 00:51:35,400
i'm all right!

539
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:38,868
i'm all right!
i'm all right!

540
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:42,601
what are you doing?

541
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:44,968
grow up.
forget about the money.

542
00:51:45,033 --> 00:51:47,234
what money?
what are you doing?

543
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:50,801
what am i doing? i'm talking to an empty phone is what i'm doing.

544
00:51:50,868 --> 00:51:52,868
'cause there's a dead man on the other end of this fucking line!

545
00:51:52,934 --> 00:51:57,734
- i love that film! - pachino. didn't you hear though?

546
00:51:57,801 --> 00:52:00,968
you oughta see the bank job shootout scene on me plasma screen!

547
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,400
come on, whitechapel,
we can still win this.

548
00:52:06,467 --> 00:52:09,734
-  come on, lads!
- shoot!

549
00:52:09,801 --> 00:52:12,801
- 
- aye! dipstick!

550
00:52:12,868 --> 00:52:13,801
sorry!

551
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,667
the ball, the ball,
the ball, the ball!

552
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:25,300
for the love of god!

553
00:52:30,901 --> 00:52:33,033
yeah! finally!

554
00:52:34,601 --> 00:52:37,834
oh, my lord!
get a life, dipstick!

555
00:52:40,901 --> 00:52:43,000
time out, ref.
time out.

556
00:52:46,567 --> 00:52:49,434
well, chaps,
could be worse.

557
00:52:51,033 --> 00:52:53,000
how could it be worse?
it's 26-nil.

558
00:52:53,067 --> 00:52:55,067
it doesn't matter.

559
00:52:55,133 --> 00:52:59,767
what matters is, there's less than a minute to play.

560
00:52:59,834 --> 00:53:03,634
and we are not leaving this pitch until we score a goal!

561
00:53:06,334 --> 00:53:09,767
matt, get the ball to ben.

562
00:53:11,467 --> 00:53:15,067
ben, this is your moment.

563
00:53:16,501 --> 00:53:18,868
i need you.

564
00:53:18,934 --> 00:53:20,901
get your little legs.

565
00:53:20,968 --> 00:53:25,200
run up that right flank
like the devil were after you.

566
00:53:25,267 --> 00:53:29,834
i'll be in the center
waiting for your cross.

567
00:53:29,901 --> 00:53:32,133
use barry if you need to.

568
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,601
matt, stay on my left flank.

569
00:53:36,367 --> 00:53:38,701
i need that cross.

570
00:53:38,767 --> 00:53:40,968
i need that ball

571
00:53:41,033 --> 00:53:43,300
here.

572
00:53:44,834 --> 00:53:46,667
i'll take the shot.

573
00:53:46,734 --> 00:53:51,634
and we, we will
share the glory.

574
00:53:52,734 --> 00:53:54,601
- got it?
- yeah.

575
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:56,767
now let's score a goal!

576
00:53:56,834 --> 00:54:00,534
come on! come on!
come on! come on!

577
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:03,801
come on, boys, come on!

578
00:55:05,767 --> 00:55:08,334
no!

579
00:55:24,334 --> 00:55:26,100
i often wonder
what it would be like

580
00:55:26,167 --> 00:55:28,801
to spend the rest of my life
with the world on pause.

581
00:55:28,868 --> 00:55:32,634
to live out the rest of my life between two fractions of a second.

582
00:55:32,701 --> 00:55:35,434
to die of old age,
and then have time continue.

583
00:55:35,501 --> 00:55:40,067
the young me gone,
and a dead old man in my place.

584
00:56:04,234 --> 00:56:07,534
was i spending too much time
in this frozen world?

585
00:56:08,834 --> 00:56:12,300
it felt safe, untouchable.

586
00:56:12,367 --> 00:56:16,100
but how safe
is anyone's world?

587
00:56:56,434 --> 00:56:58,834
hello?

588
00:57:02,601 --> 00:57:04,667
anyone there?

589
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,534
it's funny, but the
last thing i imagined

590
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:56,501
was that maybe i wasn't the
only one who could stop time.

591
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:09,734
oh, my god!

592
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,133
you all right?

593
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,200
don't just stand there!
drive me to the hospital!

594
00:58:22,067 --> 00:58:24,367
- can you make sure sharon gets home all right? - yeah.

595
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:25,501
cheers, mate.

596
00:58:29,901 --> 00:58:32,267
right, i'll see
you both tomorrow.

597
00:58:32,334 --> 00:58:34,467
- see ya.
- bye.

598
00:58:42,133 --> 00:58:43,968
- thanks.
- thank you.

599
00:58:45,501 --> 00:58:48,033
i felt that game was
never going to end.

600
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:51,300
- matt's face when the ball hit jenkins. - oh, i know.

601
00:58:51,367 --> 00:58:53,200
do you think
he'll be okay?

602
00:58:53,267 --> 00:58:56,234
it was ego more than
anything, i'd say.

603
00:59:01,567 --> 00:59:04,300
it's probably none
of my business, but,

604
00:59:04,367 --> 00:59:06,467
are you and matt
seeing each other?

605
00:59:06,534 --> 00:59:10,567
no. we went to the cinema the other night, but just as friends.

606
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:12,834
hmm.

607
00:59:12,901 --> 00:59:15,467
why? what
has matt said?

608
00:59:15,534 --> 00:59:18,467
he said he slept with you.

609
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,601
- so you didn't? - no, of course not! what do you take me for?

610
00:59:25,868 --> 00:59:27,701
sorry.

611
00:59:27,767 --> 00:59:30,300
did he say
if i was any good?

612
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:33,901
i think it was the best sex
he's never had.

613
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,734
so you don't have a boyfriend?

614
00:59:38,801 --> 00:59:41,334
no. we split
about six months ago.

615
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,434
he went off to university
in the states and

616
00:59:43,501 --> 00:59:45,734
it became impossible
to see each other.

617
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,567
and you?
do you have a girlfriend?

618
00:59:50,634 --> 00:59:52,868
we broke up
a few weeks ago.

619
00:59:52,934 --> 00:59:55,968
i'm sorry.
how are you doing?

620
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:59,167
better.

621
01:00:02,667 --> 01:00:05,868
so how long have you been
at the supermarket?

622
01:00:05,934 --> 01:00:07,734
'bout two years.

623
01:00:07,801 --> 01:00:11,767
- did you get to college? - i was doing p. t. therapy, but i dropped out.

624
01:00:11,834 --> 01:00:13,601
why?

625
01:00:13,667 --> 01:00:17,400
it wasn't me. and besides, i needed to start earning money.

626
01:00:17,467 --> 01:00:19,767
what are you saving for?

627
01:00:19,834 --> 01:00:21,834
putting myself
through evening classes.

628
01:00:21,901 --> 01:00:23,968
yeah? studying...

629
01:00:24,033 --> 01:00:25,400
spanish.

630
01:00:25,467 --> 01:00:26,968
spanish?

631
01:00:27,033 --> 01:00:29,000
yeah. what's wrong
with that?

632
01:00:29,067 --> 01:00:34,033
n-n-nothing. i just wasn't expecting it. so what can you say?

633
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:39,534
mmm...

634
01:00:39,601 --> 01:00:43,133
<i>tu equipo de futbol</i>
<i>es una puta mierda. </i>

635
01:00:44,334 --> 01:00:45,801
which means?

636
01:00:45,868 --> 01:00:49,334
it means your
football team is shit.

637
01:00:50,133 --> 01:00:52,234
26-nil.

638
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,667
so why spanish?

639
01:00:59,701 --> 01:01:02,000
i've lived here all my life.

640
01:01:02,067 --> 01:01:05,901
i've worked at the supermarket
for two years and,

641
01:01:05,968 --> 01:01:08,767
even though
it's happening slow,

642
01:01:08,834 --> 01:01:13,734
i just feel that my life's ticking away a second at a time.

643
01:01:13,801 --> 01:01:18,400
i thought that spanish would be one way that i'd be able to find a job that would involve travel.

644
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:23,534
like being an air hostess or teaching english at spanish-speaking schools.

645
01:01:23,601 --> 01:01:28,968
i've always dreamt of traveling to far-off places... like south america.

646
01:01:29,033 --> 01:01:32,100
to places where the sun
kisses every morning.

647
01:01:32,167 --> 01:01:34,167
but more than that,
i wanna be able

648
01:01:34,234 --> 01:01:38,000
to talk to people about their lives and about their dreams.

649
01:01:38,067 --> 01:01:39,968
silly, really.

650
01:01:40,033 --> 01:01:41,767
no, it's not.

651
01:01:41,834 --> 01:01:44,534
that's your dream.

652
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:46,968
knowing what you want
is half the battle.

653
01:01:47,033 --> 01:01:50,000
most people go through their whole lives not knowing what they want.

654
01:01:50,067 --> 01:01:53,701
it's easy to find if you know
what you're looking for.

655
01:01:53,767 --> 01:01:55,767
so what is it that
you're looking for?

656
01:01:55,834 --> 01:01:58,367
i've always wanted
to be a painter.

657
01:01:58,434 --> 01:02:01,501
maybe have my work hung
in a gallery one day.

658
01:02:01,567 --> 01:02:04,734
i've always wanted
to meet a painter.

659
01:02:05,968 --> 01:02:07,767
why?

660
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:10,901
don't know.

661
01:02:10,968 --> 01:02:16,200
i think it might be something to do with their ability to see beauty in everything.

662
01:02:16,267 --> 01:02:20,200
to then capture it, and hang it on a wall for all to see.

663
01:02:22,734 --> 01:02:24,801
i find it romantic.

664
01:02:36,567 --> 01:02:39,400
well, this is me.

665
01:02:39,467 --> 01:02:41,701
number 34.

666
01:02:41,767 --> 01:02:43,534
thirty-four.

667
01:02:43,601 --> 01:02:45,467
it's on the top floor.

668
01:02:45,534 --> 01:02:46,701
nice.

669
01:02:50,033 --> 01:02:51,067
<i>adios. </i>

670
01:02:52,334 --> 01:02:53,934
<i>hasta luego. </i>

671
01:03:02,801 --> 01:03:04,434
night, ben.

672
01:03:12,501 --> 01:03:14,868
that first kiss.

673
01:03:14,934 --> 01:03:18,467
i've always made
such a mess of it.

674
01:03:18,534 --> 01:03:20,133
<i></i>

675
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,334
come!

676
01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:28,400
hiya. i just wanted to know
whether you were all right.

677
01:03:28,467 --> 01:03:30,701
oh, yes, yes.
i'm fine.

678
01:03:30,767 --> 01:03:33,367
'cause it looked
really painful last night.

679
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:37,167
oh, no.
i've worse than this.

680
01:03:37,234 --> 01:03:40,334
and the hospital said
you'd be okay?

681
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,968
ah, you know.
they said i'd live.

682
01:03:43,033 --> 01:03:45,667
are you sure
you're all right?

683
01:03:45,734 --> 01:03:48,033
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

684
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:51,567
do you know?
i've almost forgot it happened.

685
01:03:51,634 --> 01:03:55,000
i really can't feel a thing!

686
01:03:55,067 --> 01:03:57,868
i'm thinking of having
a party on saturday.

687
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:01,701
you know,
cheer everybody up.

688
01:04:01,767 --> 01:04:05,267
sure you'll all be there.
won't you, sharon?

689
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,834
um, yeah.

690
01:04:09,667 --> 01:04:11,434
great.

691
01:04:20,334 --> 01:04:22,501
- hiya.
- whatcha?

692
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:25,167
thanks for walking me
home last night.

693
01:04:25,234 --> 01:04:29,701
that's all right. thanks for sharing your dream with me.

694
01:04:29,767 --> 01:04:32,267
so have you heard
the party rumor?

695
01:04:32,334 --> 01:04:34,133
no.

696
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,868
jenkins' birthday on saturday.
he's throwing a party.

697
01:04:36,934 --> 01:04:38,734
we've all got to
be there apparently.

698
01:04:38,801 --> 01:04:40,000
oh.

699
01:04:41,601 --> 01:04:43,734
will you be my date?

700
01:04:43,801 --> 01:04:45,767
sharon?

701
01:04:48,567 --> 01:04:51,634
it's my lunch break.
can you relieve me?

702
01:05:02,033 --> 01:05:04,634
so, will you
be my date?

703
01:05:04,701 --> 01:05:06,400
yeah.

704
01:05:07,467 --> 01:05:08,801
great.

705
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:13,300
shelf stacker to
aisle ten, please.

706
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:16,267
can we have a shelf stacker
to aisle ten?

707
01:05:16,334 --> 01:05:19,734
steven, if you're in the shop,
can you report to aisle ten?

708
01:05:22,767 --> 01:05:25,667
- it's your lunch break.
- no, it's not.

709
01:05:25,734 --> 01:05:28,701
- it is. it's your lunch break.
- i don't want one.

710
01:05:33,033 --> 01:05:35,200
hama-vama!

711
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:48,334
come.

712
01:05:56,734 --> 01:05:58,200
you wanted to see us?

713
01:05:58,267 --> 01:05:59,901
take a chair.

714
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,534
not there! here!

715
01:06:19,968 --> 01:06:24,033
now, we were a bit unlucky
last night, chaps.

716
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:27,868
but to lighten the mood
and to celebrate my birthday,

717
01:06:27,934 --> 01:06:30,901
i'm throwing a party at my house on saturday night,

718
01:06:30,968 --> 01:06:33,033
and you're all invited!

719
01:06:35,767 --> 01:06:37,734
good!

720
01:06:37,801 --> 01:06:42,234
now, no birthday party would be complete without a surprise stripper.

721
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:45,534
and i want one of you
to organize it. ben.

722
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:47,667
me?

723
01:06:47,734 --> 01:06:50,234
yes. here's 200 quid.

724
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:54,934
that should be plenty for some
top-shelf entertainment.

725
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,801
i'll put the details on the staff board this afternoon.

726
01:06:57,868 --> 01:07:00,601
well, get going then.

727
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:06,868
so, where are you
gonna find a stripper?

728
01:07:06,934 --> 01:07:10,400
i don't know.
but i know a man who will.

729
01:07:10,467 --> 01:07:15,767
so, your boss has given you 200 quid to get a surprise stripper for his own birthday.

730
01:07:15,834 --> 01:07:19,367
i like him! yeah, i'll help on one condition.

731
01:07:19,434 --> 01:07:21,400
- what's that?
- i can come to the party.

732
01:07:21,467 --> 01:07:24,300
- shouldn't be a problem. - cool. right, let's find you a stripper, eh?

733
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:52,467
two halves, please.

734
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:03,367
what was the other one?

735
01:08:03,434 --> 01:08:04,901
two halves.

736
01:08:04,968 --> 01:08:06,767
oh, yeah.

737
01:08:06,834 --> 01:08:09,634
i just found the world's
stupidest barman.

738
01:08:11,167 --> 01:08:13,968
- sean, i'm not sure about this.
- no, it's gonna be fine.

739
01:08:17,267 --> 01:08:20,133
that's
three quid, mate.

740
01:08:59,634 --> 01:09:00,634
yeah!

741
01:09:02,067 --> 01:09:04,701
- how much?
- a quid.

742
01:09:07,133 --> 01:09:09,200
each.

743
01:09:16,267 --> 01:09:18,701
i was, uh, wondering
if you could help us.

744
01:09:21,067 --> 01:09:25,033
um, it's his boss's
birthday on saturday,

745
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:29,701
and we were looking for someone who could come and do a surprise, uh, strip.

746
01:09:29,767 --> 01:09:32,100
i'm busy on saturday.

747
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:37,200
oh, um, well, do you know anyone
else who might be available?

748
01:09:37,267 --> 01:09:41,234
i know one.
but she's very expensive.

749
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:44,133
that's cool.
is she here?

750
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:47,534
no. she only does
private venues.

751
01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:50,334
she's gorgeous.
top of the line, you see.

752
01:09:51,901 --> 01:09:54,267
hiya, ben.

753
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:08,734
will you be my date?

754
01:10:29,701 --> 01:10:32,133
- ben!
- huh?

755
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,267
- 200.
- what?

756
01:10:34,334 --> 01:10:36,601
200 for the stripper.

757
01:10:36,667 --> 01:10:38,400
oh.

758
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:40,767
don't worry, love,
she's class.

759
01:10:41,801 --> 01:10:44,133
- okay.
- great.

760
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,234
two tickets
to pittsburgh!

761
01:10:51,534 --> 01:10:55,901
it was now my fourth
straight week without sleep.

762
01:10:55,968 --> 01:10:59,100
i had slowly stopped thinking about suzy and had dragged myself into the present.

763
01:11:01,367 --> 01:11:05,334
the extra eight hours of my life had done nothing to slow the effect of time.

764
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,634
the minutes flew into hours,
the hours into days.

765
01:11:08,701 --> 01:11:12,501
and the days joined
the fast rushing river of time.

766
01:11:13,734 --> 01:11:16,801
the bad news
is that time flies.

767
01:11:16,868 --> 01:11:20,367
the good news
is that you're the pilot.

768
01:11:20,434 --> 01:11:24,000
most of my shifts were now spent
thinking about sharon.

769
01:11:30,601 --> 01:11:33,834
i drew her endlessly.
over and over.

770
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:39,767
her pale, milky skin.
her delicate frame.

771
01:11:43,634 --> 01:11:46,434
in her eyes,
i could see the world.

772
01:11:48,801 --> 01:11:52,701
i thought about sharon escaping the life-sapping neons of the supermarket...

773
01:11:53,834 --> 01:11:56,567
traveling to south america,

774
01:11:56,634 --> 01:11:59,167
pursuing her dreams.

775
01:11:59,234 --> 01:12:02,200
i thought about her
asking me to go with her.

776
01:12:02,267 --> 01:12:05,067
both sharing in our dreams.

777
01:12:05,133 --> 01:12:08,701
her love of people,
and my love of painting them.

778
01:12:28,968 --> 01:12:31,701
- you off home?
- yeah.

779
01:12:31,767 --> 01:12:35,567
you still wanna be my date for
the party tomorrow night then?

780
01:12:35,634 --> 01:12:37,300
yeah, of course.

781
01:12:37,367 --> 01:12:39,400
will you come by
and pick me up?

782
01:12:39,467 --> 01:12:41,267
yeah.

783
01:12:41,334 --> 01:12:43,234
8:00?

784
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:46,601
- yeah, 8:00.
- okay. see you tomorrow.

785
01:12:58,634 --> 01:13:01,434
sharon had broken the spell.

786
01:13:01,501 --> 01:13:03,934
for the first time
in weeks, i slept.

787
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,267
i slept right through

842
01:18:35,968 --> 01:18:38,901

845
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,834

who's natalie?

852
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,167
it's a long story.

853
01:21:03,234 --> 01:21:06,234
well, your act's grown leaps and bounds since the garage.

854
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,767
- god, how long ago was that?
- uh...

855
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,467

01:21:16,534 --> 01:21:18,400
yeah, i'd love to.

857
01:21:27,367 --> 01:21:29,734
is this the queue
for the loo?

858
01:21:38,667 --> 01:21:40,434
sharon!

859
01:21:40,501 --> 01:21:42,501
thanks.

860
01:21:42,567 --> 01:21:44,334
thanks.

861
01:21:47,734 --> 01:21:51,167
so, you wanna
come up to my bedroom?

862
01:21:51,234 --> 01:21:53,767
eat some popcorn?
shag?

863
01:21:53,834 --> 01:21:55,634
no.

864
01:21:55,701 --> 01:21:58,300
why? what's the matter?
don't you like popcorn?

865
01:21:58,367 --> 01:22:00,133
barry's gonna do a stunt!

866
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:04,033
barry's gonna do a stunt! barry's gonna do a stunt! everyone!

867
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:05,601
no, but seriously
though, sharon.

868
01:22:05,667 --> 01:22:07,934
i always thought that one day
you and me might...

869
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,033
are you wearing
eyeliner?

870
01:22:20,734 --> 01:22:22,067
hey, ben.

871
01:22:23,067 --> 01:22:24,200
hey.

872
01:22:27,033 --> 01:22:29,801
we really made a mess
of things, didn't we?

873
01:22:29,868 --> 01:22:32,367
wasn't that bad.

874
01:22:32,434 --> 01:22:37,334
i just wanted to say that
i'm sorry about everything.

875
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,501
i know i never really gave you
a chance to make me happy.

876
01:22:40,567 --> 01:22:43,934
you can't rely on other people
to make you happy, suzy.

877
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,501
i know!

878
01:22:53,067 --> 01:22:54,467
is that you?

879
01:22:55,868 --> 01:22:59,834
yeah. jungle survival
course, mexico.

880
01:22:59,901 --> 01:23:01,567
but enough about me.

881
01:23:02,634 --> 01:23:04,067
you.

882
01:23:05,267 --> 01:23:06,267
you!

883
01:23:07,701 --> 01:23:10,133
you look

884
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,334
gorgeous tonight, sharon.

885
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,767
i still think about you
all the time, ben.

886
01:23:28,834 --> 01:23:30,934
why are you
telling me this?

887
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,501
have you seen ben?

888
01:23:34,567 --> 01:23:37,434
five! four!

889
01:23:37,501 --> 01:23:39,801
three! two!

890
01:23:39,868 --> 01:23:42,400
one! go!

891
01:23:43,501 --> 01:23:45,267
no.

892
01:24:19,634 --> 01:24:22,400
you can speed it up,
you can slow it down.

893
01:24:22,467 --> 01:24:24,868
you can even
freeze a moment.

894
01:24:24,934 --> 01:24:27,133
but you can't
be rewind time.

895
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,901
you can't undo
what is done.

896
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:35,534
i thought about
what she'd seen.

897
01:24:35,601 --> 01:24:37,834
i thought about
what she hadn't seen.

898
01:24:37,901 --> 01:24:39,901
i thought about
how i could explain.

899
01:24:39,968 --> 01:24:42,267
but the more i thought about it, the more i knew

900
01:24:42,334 --> 01:24:45,634
nothing i could say
would make her anger go away.

901
01:24:45,701 --> 01:24:48,067
how long could
i just wait there

902
01:24:48,133 --> 01:24:50,334
delaying
the inevitable?

903
01:24:53,133 --> 01:24:55,501
i had sat there with the world
on pause for two days

904
01:24:55,567 --> 01:24:58,267
and still
no solution had come.

905
01:24:58,334 --> 01:25:00,734
i thought about the night
at the sports center

906
01:25:00,801 --> 01:25:03,634
when i'd seen a person move
when time was frozen.

907
01:25:04,868 --> 01:25:07,234
if other people could move
within the frozen world,

908
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:10,067
then maybe it was something
i could bring sharon in on.

909
01:25:10,133 --> 01:25:12,868
it was the best
i could come up with.

910
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,300
sharon?

911
01:25:31,367 --> 01:25:33,033
i'm definitely winded.

912
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:36,467
i had forgotten how fast
everything was moving.

913
01:25:45,167 --> 01:25:46,734
hello?

914
01:25:46,801 --> 01:25:48,367
sharon, it's me.

915
01:25:51,267 --> 01:25:52,534
hello?

916
01:26:34,367 --> 01:26:36,601
this felt familiar.

917
01:26:41,567 --> 01:26:44,734
i tried to explain
that suzy was an ex.

918
01:26:44,801 --> 01:26:48,000
and she had attacked me
when my guard was down.

919
01:26:48,067 --> 01:26:51,234
sharon had seen the wrong second
of a two-second story.

920
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:53,567
but she wasn't listening.

921
01:27:59,667 --> 01:28:03,300
member of cleaning staff
to aisle three, please.

922
01:28:03,367 --> 01:28:05,834
cleaning staff
to aisle three quickly.

923
01:28:41,934 --> 01:28:45,267
- what language is that?
- russian.

924
01:28:45,334 --> 01:28:47,634
- do you speak russian?
- no.

925
01:28:47,701 --> 01:28:50,667
can i get it back
on to english?

926
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:54,133
yep? can i help you?

927
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:55,968
i've got an appointment
with alex prout.

928
01:28:56,033 --> 01:28:57,801

929
01:28:57,868 --> 01:29:00,100
hi. ben willis.

930
01:29:03,434 --> 01:29:05,634
you called me
about my work.

931
01:29:05,701 --> 01:29:09,367
there must be some mistake.
i've never heard of you.

932
01:29:11,133 --> 01:29:13,400
you didn't call me?

933
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,033
bastards.

934
01:29:27,367 --> 01:29:30,901

935

950
01:31:30,734 --> 01:31:33,267
i'd be interested to talk
to you about your next show.

951
01:31:33,334 --> 01:31:35,133
my next show?

952
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,434
yes. any ideas of what
you might like to do?

953
01:31:37,501 --> 01:31:39,234
um...

954
01:31:44,133 --> 01:31:46,868
i'd like to go and paint
in south america.

955
01:31:48,067 --> 01:31:50,634
well, that sounds
wonderfully romantic.

956
01:31:50,701 --> 01:31:54,200
here. take my card.

957
01:31:55,434 --> 01:31:56,501
call me.

958
01:31:57,601 --> 01:31:58,734
well done.

959
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:52,334
hey.

960
01:32:54,334 --> 01:32:55,267
hey.

961
01:32:55,334 --> 01:32:58,033
congratulations.
this is...

962
01:32:59,234 --> 01:33:01,400
so great.

963
01:33:01,467 --> 01:33:02,834
thanks.

964
01:33:02,901 --> 01:33:06,133
- how have you been?
- good.

965
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,634
i haven't seen you
at work.

966
01:33:08,701 --> 01:33:11,167
no, i've got a job
at a travel agent's.

967
01:33:12,834 --> 01:33:15,167
so you're one step closer
to your dream.

968
01:33:20,601 --> 01:33:24,000
listen, i'm sorry about
what happened at the party.

969
01:33:24,067 --> 01:33:27,701
whether you saw the second after or not, it doesn't matter.

970
01:33:27,767 --> 01:33:30,534
i've learned it's what you do with every single second that counts.

971
01:33:30,601 --> 01:33:32,267
shh. it's okay.

972
01:33:34,367 --> 01:33:37,801
this tells me so much more
than you could ever say.

973
01:33:46,067 --> 01:33:48,200
it's snowing outside.

974
01:33:55,133 --> 01:33:57,234
do you trust me?

975
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:58,667
why?

976
01:33:59,767 --> 01:34:01,801
i need to know.

977
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:23,634
what happened?

978
01:34:23,701 --> 01:34:26,367
i need to show
you something.

979
01:34:51,667 --> 01:34:55,968
once upon a time,
i wanted to know what love was.

980
01:34:56,033 --> 01:34:58,968
love is there
if you want it to be.

981
01:34:59,033 --> 01:35:01,501
you just have to see
that it's wrapped in beauty

982
01:35:01,567 --> 01:35:04,601
and hidden away between
the seconds of your life.

983
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,534
if you don't stop
for a minute,

984
01:35:10,601 --> 01:35:11,968
you might miss it.

985
01:38:05,234 --> 01:38:08,701
barry! barry! barry! barry!

986
01:38:08,767 --> 01:38:11,467
barry! ooh! oh!
