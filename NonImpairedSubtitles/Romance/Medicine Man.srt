1
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,278
Goodbye. Enjoy your stay.

2
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,352
The foundation for whom I work
supports a botanist...

3
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,671
named Robert Campbell, once of some note.

4
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,355
But on separating from his wife
and long-time research partner...

5
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,750
he'd withdrawn his station
deeper into the bush.

6
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,231
And until last month's message,
no one had heard from him in three years.

7
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,189
He asked for an assistant
and a gas chromatograph...

8
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,876
and pointedly refused to say why.

9
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,793
I'm surprised they sent a woman.

10
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,798
For Dr. Campbell.

11
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,597
please don't lose it.

12
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,919
Wait a minute. Aren't you coming with me?

13
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,039
I'm afraid he was adamant about that.
Tanaki will guide you from here.

14
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,915
Come on, you, go.

15
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,954
Come on.

16
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,389
Careful.

17
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,553
Are we here?

18
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,397
Okay, ready? Here you go.

19
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,673
Indian?

20
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,908
Oh, boy.

21
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,954
-Who are you?
-Who am I? Who are you?

22
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,912
I asked you first.

23
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,033
-You're Dr. Campbell, right?
-I know who the hell I am.

24
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,192
-I'm asking who you are.
-Crane.

25
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,192
No, toucan.

26
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,233
-No, that's my name.
-Toucan?

27
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,276
-How odd.
-Crane. Dr. Rae Crane.

28
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,870
I do wish you'd make up your mind.

29
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,793
Maybe it's best we talk
in the morning, Doctor.

30
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,632
This is from Ornega.

31
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,190
How about a place to sleep?

32
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,754
Ornega?

33
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,398
Are you from Aston?

34
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,349
-He sent you?
-I tell you. They sent a girl.

35
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,351
-They sent a girl?
-Yes.

36
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,868
-I'm not a girl.
-The hell you're not.

37
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,077
-I'm your research assistant.
-The hell you are.

38
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,313
-Where's your mask?
-I don't have one. I just got here.

39
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,551
No one comes in here
without a surgical mask.

40
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,396
God knows what bugs you're carrying.
Jahausa, get her a mask.

41
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,439
-Relax. This is as close as we get, Tonto!
-Not for me, you hussy!

42
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,158
-For the Indians.
-Hussy?

43
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,793
One outsider with a common cold
can decimate an entire tribe.

44
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,949
-And what about your shots?
-What about a place to sleep, God damn it?

45
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,678
To sleep?

46
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,509
sleep.

47
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,274
Yes, of course, please forgive me.

48
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,114
There's no need for you to leave
till tomorrow.

49
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,229
I must tell you how grateful I am.
I've been waiting for these.

50
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,590
They get Iost in the forest, you see?

51
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,436
The forest is so vast
and they're just so very small.

52
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,233
Dr. Campbell?

53
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,995
No, Palala. Back to the boat.

54
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,996
You had no right to unpack that equipment.
Where are you going?

55
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,435
-No.
-That's all right. He's Ioading the boat.

56
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,239
-No boat.
-Palala, only those boxes are staying.

57
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,719
Come on, up.

58
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,354
Luggage down. Come on, put it down.

59
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,435
Would you do me a favour
and ask him to put my Iuggage down?

60
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,952
Sorry, I forget women
like to carry their own now.

61
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,116
I think I should introduce myself.

62
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,078
You're the so-called research
assistant from Aston.

63
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,516
-You don't remember last night?
-Do I appear senile?

64
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,589
Drunk.

65
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,758
-Intoxicated, yes.
-There's a difference?

66
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,438
The Peach Palm Festival
is a religious ceremony.

67
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,158
Are those bags too heavy?
Shall I call Palala back?

68
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,789
No. I'm not getting on a boat. No boat.

69
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,952
It's the only available transport,
and you certainly can't remain here.

70
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,989
-Why? Because I'm not a man?
-Because you're not one of three men.

71
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,912
I requested Dr. Alan Sealove.
If he was unavailable, Dr. Gregory Hoffman.

72
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,037
I'm published more extensively
than Dr. Sealove.

73
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,874
I hold degrees from CCNY,
Berkeley, and Cambridge.

74
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,913
I'm the recipient...

75
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,510
of the Thurman Award in '82 and '86.

76
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,872
The first and only time it's ever been given
to the same person twice.

77
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,880
Is there anything else
you'd like to know about me?

78
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,793
-Do those boots come with a manual?
-No.

79
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,718
I thought of snakes.

80
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,313
When was the last time
you did field research?

81
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,152
Or when was the first time?

82
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,517
I did a month in La Salva.

83
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,914
A whole month?

84
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,272
You didn't need me.

85
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,510
-You needed a caddie.
-Palala will carry your bags to the boat.

86
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,189
You send me back on the basis of
my gender, that's called sex discrimination.

87
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,674
Look, I understand your reservations.
I heard about your wife.

88
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,110
My wife? Good God, she Ieft me.

89
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,312
I wish you'd follow her example.
Are we finished?

90
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,955
-You have a boat to catch.
-No boat.

91
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,078
-I want a meal and a bath.
-This isn't a hotel.

92
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,675
-I'll leave when I'm damn well ready.
-I know, after a meal and a bath.

93
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,275
I'm not a 19-year-old grad student
working up a resume.

94
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,637
And I don't expect to be treated as if I were.

95
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,550
I'm hungry, I'm tired...

96
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,836
and I've been in these clothes
for more than one dance.

97
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,235
Palala will see that you get some breakfast.

98
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,117
I said, and a bath.

99
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,632
Unbutton your shirt.

100
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,193
Excuse me?

101
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,393
Do you want to bathe in their water supply?
You'll take a medical first.

102
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,078
Sit down. Here.

103
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,797
-Is he gonna watch?
-Don't you want a nurse present?

104
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,791
-I'll risk it.
-I won't.

105
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,994
Deep breath.

106
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,752
Now I understand why you've been
so secretive about your research here.

107
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,438
You found the cure
for the common hangover.

108
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,509
Look up.

109
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,189
Left.

110
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,549
Right.

111
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,910
-Open your mouth.
-There's nothing wrong--

112
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,194
Say "ah."

113
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,392
Let me see your carnet.

114
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,715
-My what?
-It's in your passport.

115
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,958
Your vaccine card.

116
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,959
This is completely unnecessary.

117
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,552
The principal cause of death
among aboriginals is imported disease.

118
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,512
What do you see?

119
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,191
I thought we did the eye examination.

120
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,556
Come on, you won two Thurman Awards,
show off.

121
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,277
What am I analysing?

122
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,392
Did you run a base Iine?

123
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,069
No.

124
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,798
Next time run a base Iine
to calibrate the machine.

125
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,917
There's a glucose solution
specifically for that.

126
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,560
Is that the substance you're analysing?

127
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,789
Yes.

128
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,278
-What is it, a plant extract?
-Full marks. Continue.

129
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,389
Okay.

130
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,071
We're Iooking at...

131
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,879
49 compound.

132
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,313
Okay, what we've got here is....

133
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,672
Where was I? Okay, 49 compound.

134
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,229
No.

135
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,391
Nearly all of these are identifiable.
In short, nothing new.

136
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,598
Is this why you wanted the chromatograph?

137
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,037
You said "nearly all identifiable."

138
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,469
Yeah.

139
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,480
Just this one, Peak 37.

140
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,469
Looks like an acid derivative.
AIthough those side....

141
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,868
You must have thought
you were onto something.

142
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,349
-I'm sorry.
-Can it be synthesised?

143
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,831
This one's mother nature's kitchen.
End of story.

144
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,869
Why?

145
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,277
-What is it you think you've got?
-I don't think.

146
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,837
-I know.
-Share it.

147
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,832
What's the problem?

148
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,839
Even as a child, I didn't like to share.
It was deep-seated, I suppose.

149
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,993
What is it, a secret?
I'll cross my heart and spit on the floor.

150
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,588
You said breakfast and a bath.

151
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,754
You saving it for Sealove?
Don't, he's not coming.

152
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,350
Then I'll settle for Robinson.

153
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,910
You were Iucky you got me
and last year's chromatograph.

154
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,909
I give up.

155
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,359
I believe our deal was
bath, breakfast, and boat.

156
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,274
I didn't come here to make deals.

157
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,311
Then why did you come here?

158
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,874
I'll leave the chromatograph
for the time being.

159
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,473
I'm asking you a question.

160
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,835
You have no idea, have you?

161
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,954
Aston's considering pulling your funds
and shipping you out.

162
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,951
I'm your judge and jury.

163
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,032
-Winslow would never permit that.
-Winslow!

164
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,034
Winslow retired last year.

165
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,672
If you hadn't cut off incoming,
you would have known that.

166
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,433
-Who replaced him?
-Me.

167
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,154
You don't send progress reports.

168
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,995
You move your damn station
wherever and whenever you like.

169
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,159
You don't send in a record of expenses!

170
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,032
And you don't respond
to requests for information.

171
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,359
So here I am!

172
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,951
-Put this on. I want to show you something.
-I've seen it.

173
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,399
Put in on!

174
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,875
please.

175
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,595
Follow me.

176
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,598
This is Kalana...

177
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,637
wife of Jahausa, mother of Imana.

178
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,752
Palpate her throat.

179
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,318
I'm not a medic.

180
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,396
Good God, woman, must everything
be a full-scale debate with you? Just do it.

181
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,634
Feel anything?

182
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,394
Nothing.

183
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,995
Six months ago, she came to see me.
Couple of Iumps on her throat.

184
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,993
I sent her down river with
a Franciscan missionary to the hospital.

185
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,158
Then she made her own way back.
It took her a month.

186
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,029
And the nodes were almost double the size.

187
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,073
Two injections of that sample
you just tested...

188
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,308
and the Iumps disappeared within a week.

189
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,675
No boosters, no side effects.

190
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,312
That's just swell.

191
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,120
What am I supposed to report
to the Foundation?

192
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,760
Dr. Campbell showed me a cured patient...

193
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,789
who claims a history of undiagnosed,
undocumented Iumps in her throat?

194
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,800
-You're untiring.
-Here it is.

195
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,789
-You're untiring.
-Here it is.

196
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,752
Her scan report.
She brought it back from Manikovi.

197
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,239
That's delightful.

198
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,440
I'll bring it with me. If you'll contact--

199
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,830
Stage 2, anterior and posterior Iymphomas.

200
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,913
Here. Check her biopsy report.

201
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,753
What for? It could be anybody's.

202
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,669
-Okay.
-You think I'm Iying?

203
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,599
You're a man
who's allowed his personal problems...

204
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,150
to get in the way of his clinical judgment.
That's what I think.

205
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,389
Stay here.

206
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,948
Stay here.

207
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,354
He talks to me like a dog.
500,000 scientists in this world...

208
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,512
and I end up with Dr. Mengele
with a ponytail.

209
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,917
Now what? Good God!

210
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,549
Feel that?

211
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,035
What is it?

212
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,669
-A supraclavicular node. Malignant.
-How do you know?

213
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,638
I gave it to him.

214
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,280
Transplanted tissue, I gave it to them all.

215
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,636
You will biopsy the Iot. I insist.

216
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,270
That is your control group.

217
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,872
And this Iucky bugger
gets an injection by nightfall...

218
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,236
and tomorrow, in the morning,
you will examine him.

219
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,914
Come on, I'm not proposing marriage.

220
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,958
I'm asking you to biopsy a family of rodents.

221
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,474
Spend 12 hours in a perfectly
Iuxurious hammock.

222
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,757
You don't have to think about that, just nod.

223
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,629
No ball.

224
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,072
What was in the tin?

225
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,072
The boys, you were giving them
something from the tin.

226
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,913
Candy coated ants.

227
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,913
Do you want some?
The tin is inside on the table.

228
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,029
I'll pass.

229
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,874
What about you?

230
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,715
What is it?

231
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,319
-Freeze dried ice cream.
-I'll pass.

232
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,755
Come on, the astronauts eat it.

233
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,591
It doesn't taste like ice cream.

234
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,920
When was the last time
you had a double dip?

235
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,718
The palate remembers.

236
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,632
That woman, Kalana?

237
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,556
She called you something.

238
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,193
What's it mean?

239
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,759
Medicine Man, that's me.

240
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,753
-Don't they have one of their own?
-What?

241
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,033
Medicine Man.

242
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,157
I gave AIka-Seltzer to a kid with a bellyache.

243
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,558
You did what?

244
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,472
AIka-Seltzer. It cured him with one belch.

245
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,435
But it was the plop and the fizz
that really dazzled them.

246
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,309
The Medicine Man
was understandably pissed off.

247
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,073
I had taken his stick.

248
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,069
Stick?

249
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,672
Yeah, his self-respect. His place.

250
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,078
He just took off.

251
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,713
My intentions were well meant.

252
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,716
You take the hammock,
I'll sleep in the greenhouse.

253
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,073
-If I need anything, I'll let you know.
-You will?

254
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,875
Good. Thank you.

255
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,519
Dr. Campbell?

256
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,548
AIready?

257
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,754
My name is Dr. Crane, Rae Crane.

258
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,429
Just in case
you need to address me directly.

259
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,594
I thought I'd just call you Brooklyn.

260
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,873
I'm from the Bronx.

261
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,830
Oh, well, Bronx.

262
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,953
It doesn't quite roll off the tongue, does it?

263
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,754
Good night.

264
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,235
-What the hell are you doing?
-I'm covering my ass.

265
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,029
I don't want you accusing me of
playing switcheroo with your control group.

266
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,950
I get it, Peach Palm Festival, day two.

267
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,837
No festival, just a bedtime story.

268
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,353
You're staring at me.

269
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,349
Pyjamas.

270
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,830
I haven't seen pyjamas in...

271
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,993
a Iong time.

272
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,389
Jesus!

273
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,748
What is it now?

274
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,709
God.

275
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,873
It's all right. That's Henry.

276
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,557
He keeps the place free of rats.
Come on, old dear.

277
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,876
Look, I'll sleep with Iizards
and I'll sleep with guinea pigs--

278
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,236
I understand.
A girl has to draw the Iine somewhere.

279
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,399
Come on, old dear.

280
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,155
-Sweet dreams.
-Go to hell.

281
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,074
Probably.

282
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,309
No.

283
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,909
You?

284
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,398
Why do you think that?

285
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,038
-That's very funny.
-Dr. Campbell?

286
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,669
Imana.

287
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,272
Get stuffed, both of you.

288
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,273
Jesus, Campbell.

289
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,349
I know.

290
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,749
You know?

291
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,319
You've found a cure for cancer,
and all you can say is I know?

292
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,910
-What is it?
-Bromeliad. The flower.

293
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,719
How'd you find it?

294
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,354
Get dressed.

295
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,749
Okay.

296
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,828
I came here six years ago. Why?

297
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,959
A freak tribe, no cancer.

298
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,230
-What about the woman you showed me?
-No, Jahausa married outside the tribe.

299
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,678
Kalana is an Exoti.

300
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,758
-Then it's genetic.
-No. It's environmental.

301
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,635
The tribes have always inter-married.

302
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,512
But as far as I can tell...

303
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,390
the bromeliad doesn't grow anywhere
except here.

304
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,310
So the Exoti don't use it.

305
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,955
Kalana still doesn't put it in the food.
She says it tastes bad.

306
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,836
So they eat this flower?

307
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,633
They ingest it.

308
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,429
Snuff.

309
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,909
And sometimes chewing tobacco.
It's in most of their food.

310
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,233
It grows wild, 100 feet up in the canopy.

311
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,753
Ten storeys up?

312
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,711
On the top shelf
of the pharmacological superstore.

313
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,392
It Iives off a tree.

314
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,999
I've seen the old Medicine Man up there
gathering for his juju kit...

315
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,952
and there it was.

316
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,596
There's only one fly in the serum.

317
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,911
I can't reproduce it.

318
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,273
What do you mean?

319
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,270
None of the new samples work.

320
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,153
I have very Iittle of the original serum Ieft.

321
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,909
That's what I mean when I say
I can't reproduce it.

322
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,116
Wait a minute, I don't understand.

323
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,510
What don't you understand?

324
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,638
I found a cure for the fucking plague
of the 20th century and now I've Iost it!

325
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,154
Haven't you ever Iost anything, Dr. Bronx?

326
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,879
You purse, your car keys?
It's rather like that.

327
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,951
Now you have it, now you don't!

328
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,158
-Your notes are gone?
-I have my notes.

329
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,719
I followed my notes.

330
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,519
-Your notes must be wrong.
-They're not.

331
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,198
Then explain it.

332
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,592
I can't.

333
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,949
Okay.

334
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,591
The first thing I do when I get to LA
is I get Dr. Crouse.

335
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,832
-His people can set up a real lab here.
-There's nothing wrong with this lab.

336
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,315
-We've got everything we need.
-Look...

337
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,713
this is major Ieague.

338
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,474
You need help.

339
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,355
I promise you will get full credit.

340
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,508
Do you think I give a damn
about the immortal textbook quote?

341
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,389
Dare I insult you with a history Iesson?

342
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,917
Better still, how about subtraction?

343
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,989
Nine million Indians in the Amazon...

344
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,109
white men bring measles,
flu, polio, and chicken pox.

345
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,756
Now you've got 2,00,000 Indians.

346
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,037
Without using your fingers,
just how many did we shove in the hole?

347
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,669
It's not like they'll be unvaccinated.
These people would work for Aston.

348
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,230
All precautions would be taken.
You don't remember Mocara.

349
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,029
Do you?

350
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,519
You're too young.

351
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,352
Some overeager son of a bitch
found a great Iittle painkiller in the jungle.

352
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,280
Fifteen cents to make a $5 bottle.

353
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,314
Aston was on to it like a fly to dung.

354
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,438
All very scientific, all precautions taken.

355
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,551
Swine flu killed the entire village.

356
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,678
Much regret, so sorry.

357
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,995
The eager beaver still ended up
with his 10 cents on the dollar--

358
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,072
This isn't a painkiller.
This is the cure for cancer.

359
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,470
These people don't need
a cure for cancer, ask them!

360
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,710
There's a road coming into the area.

361
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,758
You're finished. Aston can stop that!

362
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,958
Aston will need the road. They'll ensure
that it Ieads right up to my palapa.

363
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,952
-How can I go--
-How can you go when I need you here?

364
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,509
What?

365
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,352
No.

366
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,038
I'm a damn good bio-chemist.
I'm not a field researcher.

367
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,271
I haven't done this work for years.
I'm not qualified.

368
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,432
I know, too many foundation fund raisers.

369
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,318
Too many sub-committees.

370
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,119
Take two guinea pigs
and call me in the morning.

371
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,192
When you're old and grey...

372
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,909
you'll put Iilies on my grave
and wish you could thank me.

373
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,072
Yeah, well, I'll thank you now,
but I'm still Ieaving.

374
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,269
How?

375
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,634
Campbell?

376
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,470
-I'm not your prisoner.
-No...

377
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,557
you're my research assistant.

378
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,592
You're not afraid of heights,
are you, Bronx?

379
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,393
Right foot up.

380
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,954
There we go.

381
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,234
You give the counterweight a good yank...

382
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,073
and up you go.

383
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,989
Come on.

384
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,753
I want you to see.

385
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,949
Come on.

386
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,709
All right.

387
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,799
Dr. Bronx?

388
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,953
Left Ieg first.

389
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,632
And now the right.

390
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,708
All right?

391
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,349
Come on.

392
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,709
Oh, God!

393
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,352
Think of Neil Armstrong.

394
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,879
All right.

395
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,232
I'll give you one week.

396
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,313
Did you hear me?

397
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,388
They're not in abundance.
If you find one, pop it in the bag.

398
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,995
-Are you gonna tell me what they Iook like?
-Yes.

399
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,671
Like this.

400
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,989
Whatever this flower needs to fertilise,
it gets it up here.

401
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,994
Whether it's an enzyme
being transported by...

402
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,832
an insect for the pollen...

403
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,548
or God knows what Ieaking out of a tree.

404
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,155
It could be anything. It could be everything.

405
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,437
That's the beauty of this system.
You can't beat it.

406
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,912
You can only wipe it out.

407
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,359
Is that the road?

408
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,599
You see the river?

409
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,348
No one can remember it ever being this Iow.

410
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,596
-What about all the rain?
-Every year it rains Iess.

411
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,429
Less rainforest means Iess rain.

412
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,154
The Indians have asked me
to pray for a deluge.

413
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,396
Do you pray, Bronx?

414
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,912
There's so much smoke.
I didn't know the road was so close.

415
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,992
Yes, well, death is inevitable, Dr. Bronx.

416
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,988
But it's considered bad form
to discuss it over a man's sickbed.

417
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,318
Yeah, well, closing your eyes
won't make it disappear.

418
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,199
Neither will talk. Let's go.

419
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,035
-You're a Iunatic.
-I'll show you a shortcut!

420
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,436
God!

421
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,870
-When was it made?
-What?

422
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,995
The eighth sample, when was it made?

423
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,759
Data sheets, green notebook, top Ieft.

424
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,636
-You don't smoke, do you?
-No, I quit.

425
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,317
Good God, why? They've been missing
from the last three shipments.

426
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,312
I suspect Jahausa's got something
to do with it.

427
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,232
Your other Ieft.

428
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,914
Last one.

429
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,430
Okay, Iook.

430
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,958
Here's the original extract,
the one that works.

431
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,350
Here's the eight subsequent ones
that don't work.

432
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,598
You notice anything?

433
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,878
I'll give you a hint.

434
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,633
It's missing from every failed sample.

435
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,269
Peak 37.

436
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,397
Did you vary the solution?

437
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,912
Do you think the bromeliad
changes chemistry during its Iife cycle?

438
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,233
It's not impossible.

439
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,349
But all these samples are dated
within two weeks of each other.

440
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,239
Maybe the first batch was contaminated.

441
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,670
Maybe Peak 37 is a fungus.

442
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,715
I screened every sample,
including the first one.

443
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,875
Yeah, maybe you used a dirty test tube.
Who knows?

444
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,277
There's gotta be 1,000 variations
on this plant extract.

445
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,432
And we've gotta make
and test every single one of them.

446
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,159
I tell you, we need help.

447
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,749
We're Iooking at too many possibilities.

448
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,799
Isn't that what science is all about?
EIiminating possibilities?

449
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,113
You said you needed help.

450
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,711
Jahausa, can you tell them
that I need them to break it from the root?

451
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,033
How are we doing?

452
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,432
Tell her if she breaks the leaves it's easier.

453
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,354
Imana, what are you doing?
You're in my way.

454
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,675
Are you breaking them from the roots?

455
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,718
It's Kalana.

456
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,950
I don't understand. I'm sorry.

457
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:17,557
He wants to know if you have a date
for the prom, euphemistically speaking.

458
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,598
Why are they staring at me?

459
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,070
They've never seen a virgin of your maturity.

460
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,115
I had to give them some excuse.

461
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,394
You should have said
she's engaged to be married.

462
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,119
Really? It's to be Mrs. Bronx?

463
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,557
-It will be, next winter.
-I don't approve of Iong engagements.

464
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,957
We would have married earlier,
but it wasn't convenient.

465
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,118
A marriage of convenience.

466
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,715
You probably know him,
or at Ieast his family.

467
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,199
Tom Falon?

468
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,359
Tommy Falon!

469
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,949
Good God, he's about 95 years old.

470
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,474
You'll inherit before the honeymoon's over.

471
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,835
I take my hat off to you, girl.

472
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,474
His son.

473
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,351
His son? No, I don't know the son,
but I can well imagine.

474
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,349
Good stock. Good contributor.

475
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,593
Met at a fundraiser, did we?

476
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,830
What's the difference where I met him?

477
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,480
Don't get your knickers in a twist,
Mrs. Bronx.

478
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:25,156
Just remember,
breeding is no substitute for intelligence.

479
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,797
It's often the death of it.

480
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,037
Do you have an unlimited supply
of that stuff?

481
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,076
The saliva speeds up
the fermentation process.

482
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,669
-Pass.
-You might as well.

483
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,479
We can't test this Iot for another 72 hours.

484
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,110
It'll go by just as fast
if we're testing the Iocal fungus.

485
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,033
I told you, I screened every sample.

486
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,671
-There is another possibility.
-Which is?

487
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,590
A six-pack of peach Pernod...

488
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,831
and you were drunker than a skunk
when you did the test.

489
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,354
Pernod. The "d" is silent.

490
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,110
If you're gonna hang around with
the Falons, you'd better get it right.

491
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,435
Pernod.

492
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,992
-Thank you, Doctor.
-Shall I write it down for you?

493
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,277
What if the missing step
isn't here in the lab?

494
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,552
Your Medicine Man, the first day
you saw him collect the bromeliads.

495
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,752
What if he did something?

496
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,714
Something you instinctively copied
that first time...

497
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,711
and haven't done since?

498
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,031
What if it's in the harvesting?

499
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,874
I counted at Ieast three what ifs.

500
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,109
You don't start an investigation
with "once upon a time"--

501
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,636
-What are you going to investigate?
-Not what, who!

502
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,476
Your merry men must know
where the Medicine Man is.

503
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,195
We should go and question him.

504
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,392
As you yourself pointed out,
you're scarcely a qualified field researcher.

505
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,396
And as you've pointed out,
research is a process of elimination!

506
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,199
Don't you presume to tell me
how to follow up.

507
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,953
Question the Medicine Man.

508
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,554
Don't you think
I questioned the son of a bitch?

509
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,919
PIay somewhere else!

510
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,509
Relax!

511
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,073
-They know not to urinate in the water.
-That's not my concern.

512
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,277
It should be.
Urine attracts the spiky canderoo.

513
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,832
It's a relatively tiny fish
that enters any available orifice.

514
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,993
Can't you blow a whistle?
Maybe they'd like to fetch some golf balls.

515
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,072
The spikes are angled backwards
and have to be surgically removed.

516
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,718
It's a hell of a procedure.

517
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,834
-I came to apologise.
-Are you serious?

518
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,475
-I Iost my temper.
-About the spikes?

519
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,352
No, about the Medicine Man.

520
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,399
-Damn it, Campbell, the spiky canderoo?
-Good God, where?

521
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,109
I must admit, I've never actually seen
one this far up river.

522
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,873
It's not a bad idea to keep your knickers on.

523
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,391
All gone. Satisfied?

524
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,916
I didn't mean to jump down your throat
this afternoon.

525
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,396
Then I accept your apology. Let's forget it.

526
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,431
The Medicine Man,
he wouldn't answer my questions.

527
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,230
Until I got up to leave,
and then he spoke one word:

528
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,392
-"Mocara."
-The swine flu epidemic?

529
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,948
You told me.

530
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,038
He was afraid, you see, because in Mocara...

531
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:10,432
their medicine man
had shared forbidden juju magic...

532
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,431
with the eager beaver...

533
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,357
and swine flu...

534
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,149
was the Gods' punishment
for that indiscretion.

535
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,629
All right, he wouldn't talk.

536
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,555
-He might talk to me.
-A woman?

537
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,757
Look, what do you wanna do?

538
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,310
Sit on your hands for three days
and pray for Peak 37?

539
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,997
We could take Jahausa. He could plead
our case. You could say you're sorry.

540
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,990
I don't think he knows it was me.

541
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,468
I meant sorry for the AIka-Seltzer.

542
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,550
I thought you meant Mocara.

543
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,518
Same story as Imana.

544
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,749
Supraclavicular node, non-tender.

545
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,109
Adherent to the surrounding tissues.

546
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,273
-How big would you say?
-One centimetre.

547
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,919
I'll give it to you.

548
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,916
You can't, and you know it.

549
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,629
It's so close to his windpipe,
he'll choke to death...

550
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,153
before the cancer kills him.

551
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:11,677
-It's not a weed, it's a tumour. It can wait.
-It's not a tumour, it's a child.

552
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,836
The child can wait, too.

553
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:18,193
You use up the last bit of
the working serum and we have nothing.

554
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:21,113
-You can't use the last of it.
-We know the molecule.

555
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,796
A picture. A ghost in a machine.
For Christ's sake, Campbell, use your head!

556
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,233
The boy won't die in the next 48 hours.

557
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,597
If one of those beakers sprouts Peak 37...

558
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,116
you can give samples away for Christmas,
I'll help you wrap.

559
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,670
Suppose the new serums don't work?

560
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,914
You said yourself you found the cure
for the plague of this century.

561
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,436
It belongs to the human race,
not to one sick kid.

562
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,273
Come on, give me that syringe.
It'll be my sleepless night.

563
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,709
Jahausa's taken his son
to the Medicine Man.

564
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,473
When she woke up this morning,
they were both gone.

565
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,393
-She wants me to bring them back.
-Medicine Man?

566
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,710
Kalana, where's the Medicine Man?

567
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,149
-What is she saying?
-That Jahausa's is a fool.

568
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,309
For taking him there.

569
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,755
Who can show us
where the Medicine Man is?

570
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,829
Palala.

571
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,952
-Palala can show us.
-Can't hear you.

572
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,513
Get out of there!

573
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,273
If we leave now,
we can catch up to Jahausa!

574
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,588
Can't hear you!

575
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:00,230
You got some history, fine. It's history.

576
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,591
Will you drag it around
for the rest of your Iife?

577
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,155
If that man has the answers, we need them.

578
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,993
-I can't hear--
-Can you hear me now?

579
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,278
-What is it?
-Headache.

580
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,149
Keep your eyes down,
the focus won't change...

581
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,719
you won't get a headache.

582
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,588
-You might have mentioned it earlier.
-I'm sorry, I thought I did.

583
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,591
No, I've got something better.

584
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,233
-No, give it.
-No.

585
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,351
-What is it?
-Yoco tree.

586
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,914
The bark is 3% pure caffeine.

587
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:30,238
Cures headaches, fatigue, aches, pains,
neuritis, neuralgia.

588
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:33,357
Drink it. It'll keep you on your feet
till dinnertime.

589
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,158
-Pass.
-Drink it.

590
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,753
-Pass!
-Drink it.

591
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:41,756
Or Palala will force you on your back,
while I pour it down your gullet.

592
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,794
-Isn't that right, Palala?
-Gullet.

593
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,909
Go ahead.

594
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,909
-What's the name of this bark?
-It's called Yoco.

595
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,988
Yoco. You know, this would knock
Maxwell House right off the shelf.

596
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,593
If the narcs wouldn't stop me at the border.

597
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,350
This isn't a hallucinogen, is it?

598
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,919
-Which peak is his?
-None of the above.

599
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,834
The old man Iives at the base of the gorge.

600
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,196
Downhill. Yeah.

601
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,194
We gotta talk about marketing this stuff.

602
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,154
Of course, you'd have to add sugar.

603
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,157
Your version tastes like shit.

604
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:52,915
Man, they don't spit in this one, do they?

605
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:56,710
-Spit, no. But--
-Okay, don't tell me.

606
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,353
Yocaf!

607
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,836
Yospresso!

608
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,470
Have you broken it down yet?

609
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,799
Look at that!

610
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,310
If I were the Medicine Man,
I would have taken that penthouse.

611
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,118
Why does he Iive at the bottom?

612
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,589
To get away from the constant gabbing,
most likely.

613
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,591
Sorry for disturbing you.

614
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,275
-You all right?
-I'm okay.

615
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,358
Go ahead, I'll catch up.

616
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,477
That Yocola sounds too much
like a kids' drink.

617
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,798
I'm more interested in the mass market in....

618
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,556
Okay, I'm more interested in the
mass marketing of this drink for the adults...

619
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,313
like a continental suave thing.

620
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,312
Is it difficult...

621
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,476
to process that Yoco bark?

622
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,309
Bronx?

623
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:19,074
-Where are you?
-I'm all right.

624
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:24,118
Don't play silly buggers. Where are you?

625
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,828
I'm all right.

626
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,674
I'm all right.

627
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,475
I'm okay.

628
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,798
Stay where you are.

629
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,396
I'm gonna Iower a harness.

630
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,758
You've been to the circus?

631
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,509
This is a piece of cake
compared to the triple.

632
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,716
You can tell your kids
you worked without a net.

633
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:58,349
Except, they're not gonna believe you.
All right, here we go.

634
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,197
Use your Ieft hand.
You can reach the harness.

635
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:08,675
Now, come on, reach back for the harness!

636
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:16,152
It's all right. Don't cry.

637
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:21,834
I promise you, when this is over,
you can cry all you want...

638
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,718
and I won't say a word.

639
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,234
Now come on. Reach for the harness.

640
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,311
No, I can't do it.

641
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,588
Change of plan.

642
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,030
Mohammed goes to the mountain.

643
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,038
The triple is easier.

644
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,952
All right, here I come.

645
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,714
-All right? Okay?
-No!

646
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,158
It's okay. Just let go.

647
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:11,319
-I can't do it, Campbell.
-You don't have to.

648
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,392
We'll both go down together.
It's a hell of a short cut.

649
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,149
God!

650
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,994
If I wanted to kill both of us,
I could have found easier ways, no?

651
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,589
Well, come on. Let go.

652
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,397
Come on! Let go!

653
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,598
Rae, let go!

654
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,075
Come on!

655
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,312
-Move!
-Okay.

656
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,033
You're okay. Just come down.

657
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,195
Come on.

658
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,194
There you go.

659
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,956
-Come on.
-I think I hate you.

660
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,270
Faster, let it go. Come on.

661
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,798
-I can't Iook.
-Come on.

662
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,077
-I can't Iook.
-Don't Iook. Work your hands.

663
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,196
-What happened?
-Nothing happened.

664
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,759
What happened?

665
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,836
-Just calm down.
-What're you doing?

666
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,273
What do we do now?

667
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,512
This is a rescue?

668
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,989
What's the matter with you?
What am I supposed to do, call 911?

669
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,354
You idiot!

670
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,832
-Calm down.
-Do something!

671
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,435
-Give me your hand.
-This isn't a rescue. This is a suicide pact.

672
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,397
-You idiot!
-Calm down!

673
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,791
Give me your hand.

674
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:43,559
What for? What, are you crazy?

675
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,155
Well done.

676
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:15,549
Don't cry. You were marvellous. Really.

677
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,671
The best I've ever seen.

678
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,593
And I've been to the circus
a great many times.

679
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,674
You were spectacular. Really.

680
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:26,909
Don't cry.

681
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,116
You promised I could cry all I want.

682
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:36,230
Yes, I did. Okay, go ahead.
Knock yourself out.

683
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,038
Fortunately, Palala salvaged your haversack.

684
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,190
Careful, that's Peach Pernod.

685
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,831
-I Iost it up there, I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

686
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,918
I'm trying to thank you.

687
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,550
That was a good job. Enough said.

688
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,719
Go easy on it.

689
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,395
Why? I'm not driving.

690
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,958
Or walking, apparently.

691
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,119
-Now I know why you like this stuff.
-What?

692
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,838
Don't make me Iaugh.

693
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,871
Don't make me Iaugh. It hurts.

694
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:39,829
Hold on.

695
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,433
That burns.

696
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,832
-I know.
-What is it?

697
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,429
It's magic.

698
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,795
Magic, yeah.

699
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,519
That old black magic

700
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,431
has got me in its spell

701
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:02,799
Old black magic that you weave so well

702
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,074
I know. Terrifying--

703
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,357
Icy fingers up and down your spine

704
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,112
Down my spine?

705
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:20,673
I'm in a spin, loving the spin I'm in

706
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:24,150
-All right, bed time.
-Come on, sing it, Campbell.

707
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,834
Really big finish. Come on, sing us a bar.

708
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,474
I should stay away, but what can I do?

709
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,269
I hear your name

710
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:40,352
I'm in a flame

711
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,197
Come on, sing it.

712
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,633
Get some sleep, Rae.

713
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,789
Don't!

714
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,349
What?

715
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,035
Don't call me by my given name.

716
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,273
Don't you like it?

717
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,559
Yeah, I like it.

718
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,234
Campbell?

719
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,636
Are you ready for visitors?

720
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,712
The Medicine Man?

721
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,036
He's in the neighbourhood.

722
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,358
How do you know?

723
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,518
Call it a hunch.

724
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:34,032
-We might be in the wrong gorge.
-Somehow, I doubt that.

725
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,951
I mean, are you sure
Palala knows where he Iives?

726
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,196
What if he doesn't? What do we do then?

727
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,316
I thought I was dreaming.

728
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,836
Campbell, I thought....

729
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,551
Okay, what's going on?

730
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,753
It seems there's going to be a fight.

731
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,877
Between you and him?

732
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,714
He's 3 feet tall, for Christ's sake.

733
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,588
-You wanted to pick his brains.
-Well, not off the sidewalk.

734
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:40,799
Ever mouth off to the Dean
and then need a grant?

735
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:46,871
-This is an eat crow, kiss ass contest?
-Exactly.

736
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,077
Remember what I told you
about taking his stick?

737
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:54,718
-I think this is about giving it back.
-So he's gotta win?

738
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:59,999
Okay. Bend over, take three whacks,
and let's cut to the info.

739
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,029
It doesn't quite work that way.

740
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,875
-The tricky part is....
-Is what?

741
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:10,272
Not getting my skull cracked in the process.

742
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,519
Tell him his mother eats army boots.

743
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:50,155
-This is what happens when cousins marry!
-For Christ's sake!

744
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,435
-I was helping.
-Well, don't!

745
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:03,473
-I don't need a bloody interpreter.
-I do.

746
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,439
-Don't push your Iuck, runt!
-Campbell.

747
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,918
Yeah, nice kiss.

748
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,753
What'd he say?

749
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,393
What'd he say?

750
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,472
Back to square one.

751
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:36,319
Where did I go wrong?
Eating crow, or the kissing ass department?

752
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,711
It wasn't a total Ioss.

753
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:55,116
My, my, isn't it all bright and shiny?

754
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:59,114
I cleaned up a Iittle, that's all.

755
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,559
These first four extracts
will be ready to test by 7:00.

756
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,474
I'll set my alarm clock for 6:30.

757
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,878
Incidentally, the blue doesn't come off.

758
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,471
Get drunk somewhere else.

759
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:23,271
Hey, I Iive here.
Get sanctimonious somewhere else.

760
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:28,195
I tried to get drunk at Jahausa's,
as a matter of fact.

761
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,952
But I soon tired
of hearing him pray over his only son.

762
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:36,158
So I said to myself,
"Why not visit Dr. Bronx...

763
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,152
"and her tabernacle of empirical evidence?"

764
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:45,111
-I'm not a monster, Campbell.
-No, you're not a monster.

765
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:49,830
And if I have, in any way,
labelled you monstrous...

766
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,758
by gesture or manner,
I sincerely beg your pardon.

767
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:00,079
I'd like to go to sleep now.
I have an early morning.

768
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,630
I wouldn't bother setting that alarm,
Monster Bronx.

769
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,794
He won't make it through the night.

770
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,917
You don't know that.

771
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,469
I picture you at Imana's age...

772
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:21,159
sitting in bed, awake,
arms crossed, whispering:

773
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,194
"I don't believe in ghosts."

774
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:31,351
Where was I, when you were 6 years of age
and armed against the dark?

775
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,908
Probably hiding, like you are now.

776
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:39,558
In the jungle, or in the bottle?
To which hideout are you referring?

777
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:42,638
Does it matter?

778
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:49,717
It's not as difficult as you might think,
watching someone die.

779
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:54,911
After 70 or 80 men, women, infants...

780
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,590
you begin to feel quite numb.

781
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:05,311
When I Ieft Jahausa's hut,
I was coming here to get the magic serum.

782
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,992
Save myself, of course, not the boy...

783
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,437
which makes me the monster.

784
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,028
You at Ieast would save the world.

785
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:22,590
And the world is not one choking boy,
in the middle of a disappearing forest.

786
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,629
Even though it seems that way,
here in the dark...

787
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,393
against which you are so well armed...

788
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,838
and I've only this.

789
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,235
Enough. Give me that bottle.

790
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,753
You're not a murderer.
That's not why she Ieft you.

791
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,879
What the hell do you know about it?
She Ieft me...

792
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:55,317
because I wouldn't allow her to forgive me.

793
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,949
She very much wanted to, you see.

794
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,355
But I couldn't forgive myself.

795
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,439
Until I do, no one...

796
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,472
no one's allowed.

797
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,551
We've been invited to a prayer meeting.
I'll make your excuses.

798
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,548
Kalana!

799
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:25,275
Yes, he's okay. He'll be fine.

800
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,158
What's going on? Why is everyone running?

801
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:58,993
Time's up.

802
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,712
A miracle without proof is only a miracle.

803
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:35,232
-It does not stop bulldozers.
-Look, Ornega, I injected him myself.

804
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:36,669
I'm not doubting it.

805
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:40,309
This bromeliad, I've never seen it
growing anywhere else.

806
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,630
We can't transplant it to the lab.

807
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:45,359
Christ, I couldn't bring it down
100 feet from origin.

808
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:48,113
Now you move your roads through here,
and we've Iost it.

809
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,430
Come on, Roberto, it's not my road.

810
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:53,512
We need time. We're testing new samples.

811
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:58,718
Seor Reyes has already been instructed
to move the villagers.

812
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:03,868
If a test is successful in, say,
the next 24 hours....

813
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,832
The bulldozers are running
night and day now.

814
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,112
I'm gonna retest.

815
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,714
It didn't work, Rae. It's not here.

816
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,758
You promised me a week,
you gave me a week.

817
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,912
Pack your bags, Rae,
before the road gets here.

818
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:58,674
You're always throwing me out.

819
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,076
It's for your own good.

820
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,638
-What do you know about it?
-Quite a bit.

821
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,791
You don't smoke, do you?

822
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:14,112
There's gotta be
a cigarette around here, somewhere.

823
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:28,510
Is this supposed to be me?

824
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:33,599
Supposed to be?
I think it's a very good likeness.

825
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,670
Well, take it if you want.

826
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,756
No, I'd rather you kept it.

827
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:47,278
Well, I certainly flattered you a bit
by idealising your forehead...

828
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:51,157
but a man in Iove
wouldn't notice the disparity.

829
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,633
A man in Iove?

830
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:58,876
Tommy Falon the younger. Give it to him.

831
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:04,435
I'm sure he sees your forehead
exactly as I've drawn it...

832
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,075
and he probably never noticed...

833
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:10,359
that your Ieft ear
is Iower than your right ear.

834
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:13,830
And when he's smitten,
those are the details that....

835
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,991
What are you running?

836
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,833
Base Iine.

837
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:23,516
-What are you using?
-Sugar solution.

838
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:28,678
The same solution you've used each time?

839
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:32,191
No, I ran out. Why?

840
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,470
Where'd you get the sugar?

841
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:08,156
Campbell? It's a damn poor time
for having an iron man contest!

842
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:59,880
Have you ever Iost anything, Ornega?

843
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,116
Your car keys, your wallet?

844
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:08,355
It wasn't the bromeliads, it was the ants.

845
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,318
You're certain?

846
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:14,911
I seem to have Ieft the evidence
in my other suit.

847
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:19,759
Campbell?

848
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:45,914
Roberto?

849
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,118
It's me, Miguel.

850
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:03,028
We can go, whenever you are ready.

851
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:05,959
No, I know what I'm Iooking for now.

852
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:10,109
If those Iittle orange bastards
exist somewhere else, I'll find them.

853
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,872
Look at yourself.

854
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:14,276
It's time out, my friend.

855
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:17,479
Six years and all your equipment.

856
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:21,637
-Aston isn't going to--
-Aston will replace all of it...

857
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:25,395
and provide him with a research assistant,
per his request.

858
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:30,632
Dr. Sealove, if I remember,
was your first choice.

859
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,153
Thank you.

860
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:39,198
You're welcome.

861
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,630
If you're ready, we should go.

862
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,473
Good Iuck.

863
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:05,232
Good Iuck to you.

864
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:13,998
You'll be in touch?

865
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:27,389
They won't relocate
where the government has indicated.

866
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,992
Sooner or Iater...

867
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:34,599
they'll have no place Ieft,
then they'll go where they're told.

868
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:38,870
He says the Medicine Man
has found a place upriver.

869
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:42,109
Medicine Man? You mean Campbell?

870
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,914
No, that small one, over by the trees.

871
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:52,238
Give me a minute.

872
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:36,869
All right.

873
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,519
I'll tell him.

874
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,679
He said this was your stick.

875
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:01,350
He said it's all right now,
he's found a good place.

876
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:05,551
And if you behave yourself,
you can go with them.

877
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:10,474
He said he'll teach you big magic.

878
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:17,877
He said he's never met
a man like you before.

879
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:23,229
And maybe, he never will again.

880
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,829
I'm gonna need an addition, too.

881
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:38,038
A new chromatograph,
more scopes, callipers....

882
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:41,032
I'll make sure you get everything you need.

883
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:44,830
When I reach the city,
I'll contact Dr. Sealove.

884
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:49,195
I've reconsidered.

885
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:53,518
Dr. Sealove is my second choice now.

886
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:00,478
Come on, Bronx.

887
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:02,790
You think Tom Falon's
gonna walk down the aisle...

888
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:06,839
with a woman who has something blue
as a tattoo on her forehead?

889
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:10,916
I want joint publication.

890
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:15,150
You can have whatever you want.

891
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:21,712
What do you want?

892
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:28,238
A meal and a bath.

893
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,392
Unbutton your shirt.

894
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:49,196
Dearest Tom, we're pushing upriver
in search of those ants.

895
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:54,158
And with some luck, we'll get to them
before the lumber companies do.

896
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,551
And about our marriage...

897
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:07,190
I'm not so sure I'm ready for it yet.

898
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:18,838
Life is strange.

899
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:22,558
But down here...

900
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:25,599
it seems...

901
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:29,072
so very precious.

902
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:32,239
I'm coming!
