1
00:01:05,464 --> 00:01:06,865
<i>Take a look at that view.</i>

2
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,502
<i>Spectacular, isn't it?</i>

3
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,237
But it was here
on the acropolis hill

4
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,440
that some believe
Theseus's father king Aegeus

5
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:19,443
looked out to sea, waiting
for his son to return.

6
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:21,479
See, Theseus had
promised his father

7
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,248
that if he defeated
the minotaur,

8
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:26,251
he'd hoist a white sail
on his ship as a tribute.

9
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,485
But he was so excited
to get back home,

10
00:01:28,486 --> 00:01:30,388
he forgot and he flew
the same black sail

11
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:31,656
that he set out with.

12
00:01:31,657 --> 00:01:33,690
Well, thinking his son was dead,

13
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:37,929
the heartbroken king flung
himself onto the rocks below.

14
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,933
Another victim of the cruel
tricks gods play on men.

15
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:45,170
Well, I hope you ladies
brought your handkerchiefs,

16
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,771
'cause the next thing
you're about to see

17
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:48,238
has been known to make some weep

18
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,642
at first sight.
Follow me.

19
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,511
<i>Completed in 438 B.C.,</i>

20
00:01:53,512 --> 00:01:55,246
the Parthenon.

21
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:57,549
From the Greek word<i> "parthenes,"</i>

22
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,920
meaning "virgins."

23
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,720
"The ancient Greeks
were masters of deception.

24
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,291
Even though the base
of the Parthenon appears

25
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,525
straight to the naked eye,

26
00:02:07,526 --> 00:02:09,394
<i>it is, in fact,
completely crooked.</i>

27
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,963
Indeed, if one were
to leave one's hat

28
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:13,965
on one side of the temple steps,

29
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:16,466
it would vanish altogether
when viewed from the other."

30
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:19,571
- You're making this up.
- Oh, only one way to find out.

31
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:20,738
- Oh.
- Wanna try it?

32
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:22,440
- All right.
- Come on.

33
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:24,442
All right.
You go on down there,

34
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:26,003
- I'll put the hat right here.
- Mm-hmm.

35
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:27,573
Off you go.

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,580
<i>Mmm-mmm-mmm!</i>

37
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:31,316
<i>I hear that.</i>

38
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,486
- Is this far enough?
- That's perfect.

39
00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:37,722
Oh my God, you're right.

40
00:02:37,723 --> 00:02:39,424
Really?

41
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,359
No.

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,460
Aw jeez.

43
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:46,566
Sucker born every minute.

44
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:49,723
- Come on, baby.
- I got you.

45
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,727
Oh well.

46
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:25,470
Gosh, it's so hot.

47
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:29,608
Yeah. Getting bored
of the Parthenon?

48
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:34,044
- No no no no.
- Come on, we have to finish the bottle.

49
00:03:34,045 --> 00:03:36,481
I was supposed to meet
my friends an hour ago.

50
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,693
Oh, you just tell 'em you got lost.
I'm a terrible tour guide.

51
00:03:41,052 --> 00:03:43,287
- Let me get this.
- No no no, I got it.

52
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:44,489
- I got it.
- Thank you.

53
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,691
My pleasure.

54
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:48,592
Actually, do you have any...

55
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:50,030
- Small bills?
- Oh, umm...

56
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,630
- Change?
- I think so.

57
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:55,433
- Shall I take a look?
- Yeah, actually, I'm not sure.

58
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:56,601
Okay. All right,

59
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:57,702
so it's four drachmas,

60
00:03:57,703 --> 00:04:01,072
so if I take five and $10,

61
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:03,740
I'll give you back 200 drachmas.

62
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:05,643
- Good?
- Okay.

63
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:07,812
Thank you.

64
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,620
True story.

65
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:19,724
She's very pretty, isn't she?

66
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:23,061
Oh no, I was... I was looking
at the guy that she was with.

67
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,797
He reminds me
of my father a little bit.

68
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:28,700
<i>It says we should go to
the flea market on Sunday.</i>

69
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,734
<i>Apparently it's less crowded.</i>

70
00:04:30,735 --> 00:04:33,770
Don't look now,
but there's a young guy

71
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:35,873
in a gray shirt
sitting with a girl

72
00:04:35,874 --> 00:04:37,559
in blue and white striped dress.

73
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:42,647
<i>He was at the Parthenon earlier,</i>

74
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:44,448
<i>staring at me.</i>

75
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:46,883
Staring at me now.

76
00:04:46,884 --> 00:04:49,892
Okay.

77
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,502
Now I'm curious.

78
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:18,583
Oh, I'm sorry,
I don't speak Greek.

79
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,119
- Somebody's in there.
- You're American?

80
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,153
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?

81
00:05:23,154 --> 00:05:25,556
- I'm from Trenton.
- New Jersey?

82
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:26,758
<i>Yeah.</i>

83
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,592
I thought you were Greek.

84
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:31,662
I thought you were Greek.

85
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:33,830
<i>What are you doing in Athens?</i>

86
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:36,569
Uh, I'm a tour guide.
Do you need one?

87
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,409
He's an American tour guide,
he's been here a year

88
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,643
<i>and before that he went to Yale.</i>

89
00:05:46,644 --> 00:05:49,147
- Do you believe him?
- You can ask him yourself.

90
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,675
He's gonna show us around
the flea market Sunday.

91
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,585
"Rydal."

92
00:05:55,586 --> 00:05:57,688
Fancy.

93
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:00,691
<i>So Colette tells me
you went to Yale.</i>

94
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:02,626
<i>- Yes sir.</i>
- What did you major in?

95
00:06:02,627 --> 00:06:05,496
- Economics.
- Hmm.

96
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:07,498
Good training for a tour guide.

97
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:09,900
Yeah, well, that wasn't
the plan initially.

98
00:06:09,901 --> 00:06:13,504
My father had a job lined up
at a friend's law firm and...

99
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:15,540
<i>and you ran away
as fast as you could.</i>

100
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,775
<i>Something like that. What do
you do for a living, sir?</i>

101
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:19,576
Call me Chester.

102
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:22,513
I look after people's savings,

103
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:24,614
mostly low-risk investments.
How much?

104
00:06:24,615 --> 00:06:26,220
20 drachmas.

105
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,956
There you go.

106
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:38,763
- A steal.
- You must be doing pretty well, though,

107
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:40,004
if you're staying at the grand.

108
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:42,532
Honey, look at this.

109
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:45,669
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- It sure is.

110
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,504
Actually, this is
a Cretan design.

111
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:50,508
You see how the snakes
come together and never end?

112
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:52,876
That represents immortality.

113
00:06:52,877 --> 00:06:55,479
People wear it
as a protection charm.

114
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,814
- Oh.
- You like it, hon?

115
00:06:57,815 --> 00:07:00,717
- I love it.
- Well, let's get it then.

116
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:03,221
How much is it?

117
00:07:05,723 --> 00:07:07,226
2,000 drachmas.

118
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:12,963
All right, so 1500,

119
00:07:12,964 --> 00:07:14,698
which is about $50.

120
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,566
- 50 bucks?
- Good deal.

121
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:18,636
Will he take dollars?

122
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:22,840
Well, you can give me dollars
and I'll give him drachmas.

123
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:26,779
Okay. Fair enough.

124
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,713
<i>Thank you, honey.</i>

125
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:31,849
- It looks great on you.
- It's gorgeous.

126
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,818
Say, why don't you
join us for dinner?

127
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:38,523
- Would you do that?
- Sure, yes, I'd love to.

128
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,857
But I'm... I'm meeting
a friend later.

129
00:07:40,858 --> 00:07:43,828
She can come too.

130
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:46,297
Honey,

131
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:48,032
<i>- that's embarrassing.
- No, it got so bad</i>

132
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:49,967
that we started counting
how many times a day

133
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:52,869
the Parisians would insult us.
We got up to 15 one night,

134
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,840
- nine in the same restaurant.
- Was it your first time there?

135
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:58,275
Mmm. Chester helped
liberate Paris.

136
00:07:58,276 --> 00:07:59,576
<i>- Oh, really?</i>
- All by myself.

137
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:01,546
You fought in the war?

138
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,580
Just the last part.

139
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:05,653
Whereabouts?

140
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,087
Normandy, the Ardennes,
a few other places.

141
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:13,992
Wow.

142
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:16,727
Heck of a joint you picked out.

143
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:19,729
It's modeled after
the old ottoman cafes.

144
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,665
Huh. Great guide,
isn't he?

145
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,301
<i>- Mmm, wonderful.</i>
- Knows everything.

146
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,570
Mm-hmm.
He's an even better writer.

147
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,737
Is that so?
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

148
00:08:27,738 --> 00:08:30,708
<i>What do you write? The
most beautiful poems.</i>

149
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:33,043
He's gonna be famous one day.

150
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:35,046
Happy or depressing poems?

151
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,915
- Unpublished poems, mostly.
- I'm sure you'll find...

152
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,789
- Sir.
- ...Plenty of inspiration in Greece.

153
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,359
And your first date
was yesterday?

154
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,697
- The day before.
- Oh, the day before.

155
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,634
That's the sound and light show.

156
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:59,395
I can get you tickets
if you're interested...

157
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:01,037
tomorrow night,
best seats in the house.

158
00:09:01,038 --> 00:09:03,773
Thanks,
but unfortunately, we're...

159
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:06,677
- we're leaving tomorrow.
- Oh, really?

160
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:08,812
Yeah, I wanted to show
Colette Rome and Venice

161
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:11,648
before we go back
to the states, so...

162
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:13,755
How about you?
Any plans to go home soon?

163
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:16,988
Uh, yeah, at some point,

164
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,955
when I run out of money.

165
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:20,556
Doesn't sound like
you're in a big hurry.

166
00:09:20,557 --> 00:09:23,127
Oh, thanks.
Well, Chester,

167
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:25,763
I gotta figure out
what I wanna do first.

168
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:27,697
Sure.

169
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:29,734
That's the best thing
about being your age.

170
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,369
There's a surprise
around every corner.

171
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,006
Yeah, I guess so.

172
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:37,374
Did you know
that she was a Van Buren?

173
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,812
- Who's that?
- Your friend Lauren.

174
00:09:41,812 --> 00:09:44,114
- I only just met her.
- Mm-hmm.

175
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:47,123
Was he the seventh
or the eighth president?

176
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,791
- He was the eighth.
- Yeah.

177
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:55,792
- No, I'm... I'm... I'm not...
- I know, I know.

178
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:58,995
Hey, listen,
I've been married twice,

179
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:02,667
both times to beautiful
women with no money.

180
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,935
I'm gonna say this
because I love Colette

181
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:06,870
and I'm a little tanked.

182
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:09,739
But... but they can
be a burden.

183
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,877
Yeah, well, I don't think
she's all that interested.

184
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,811
- Oh no? Hey, ladies.
- No, don't.

185
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:18,682
- What are you two gossiping about?
- None of your business.

186
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:20,951
- See?
- All right, all right.

187
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:24,220
- It was so nice to meet you.
- It was so nice to meet you.

188
00:10:24,221 --> 00:10:26,157
- Thank you for dinner.
- Bye.

189
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,426
Thanks for taking
such good care of us.

190
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,195
<i>Good luck with your studies.
</i>My pleasure.

191
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:34,065
Well, I hope
we meet again sometime.

192
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,168
Me too.

193
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:41,205
- Enjoy Rome.
- Oh. Well, we'll try.

194
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:43,974
Thank you very much.
Good night, son.

195
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:45,442
- Good night.
- Good night.

196
00:10:45,443 --> 00:10:46,982
Goodbye.

197
00:10:51,982 --> 00:10:54,819
<i>- What did you think?</i>
- She's very sweet.

198
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,821
Wouldn't trust him
to mow my lawn.

199
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,923
I thought he was...

200
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:02,792
- Very interesting.
- Oh yeah?

201
00:11:02,793 --> 00:11:04,195
Well, that's 'cause
he couldn't keep

202
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,997
- his eyes off you all night.
- No.

203
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:09,266
Does he still
remind you of your father?

204
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:14,071
He's a lot easier to talk to.

205
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:17,176
Where are you taking us
on our last day?

206
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:19,176
Sounion.

207
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:23,918
Wish we were staying longer.

208
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:30,956
Oh, she forgot her bracelet.

209
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,158
Everything all right in there?

210
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,996
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

211
00:11:38,996 --> 00:11:41,832
<i>Now we're talking.</i>

212
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:48,274
Oh yeah.

213
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:59,529
Come on. Get outta here.

214
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,835
No thank you!

215
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:22,306
Uh...<i> Parakalo.</i>

216
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:24,175
Fuck off.

217
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,578
Ah!

218
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:30,880
<i>Just put
the "do not disturb" on.</i>

219
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:32,115
No thank you.

220
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:33,187
Mr. Donlevy?

221
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:39,322
- No.
- Your name's not Donlevy?

222
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:41,639
No. No no. I think you've
got the wrong room.

223
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:46,038
How about Mr. McFarland?

224
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,205
- Yes.
- May I come in?

225
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:58,142
<i>Can I ask what this is about?</i>

226
00:12:58,143 --> 00:13:00,311
- Stock market.
- Canadian oil shares.

227
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,178
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

228
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:04,047
Hang on right here.
I'll just get

229
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:05,983
my coat and we'll go downstairs.

230
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:07,774
We can talk about it
right in here.

231
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:12,122
No, let's just go to the bar.

232
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:13,702
Right in there would be great.

233
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:20,196
Sorry to barge in
on your like this, ma'am.

234
00:13:20,197 --> 00:13:22,409
<i>Okay.</i>

235
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:34,411
Are you sure you don't
want me to wait?

236
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:36,980
It's fine. You get back
to the hotel, all right?

237
00:13:36,981 --> 00:13:38,508
I'll call you in the morning.

238
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:40,991
- Okay.
- Bye.

239
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:52,963
You ran a brokerage firm called
Donlevy & Walters back in New York.

240
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:54,130
That's right.

241
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:55,237
You with the embassy?

242
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:59,436
No.

243
00:13:59,437 --> 00:14:03,106
<i>I represent some
very unhappy clients</i>

244
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:05,981
who invested
their money with you.

245
00:14:10,581 --> 00:14:13,249
You ought to be more careful
who you do business with.

246
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,085
Listen, I'm sorry that
your clients are upset,

247
00:14:16,086 --> 00:14:18,122
but I can't help it
if the market crashes.

248
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,393
This is a nice hotel.

249
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:25,095
Just like all the other nice
hotels you've been staying at.

250
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:28,412
<i>I've been following your trail all
across Europe, Mr. McFarland.</i>

251
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,268
You've been throwing
a lot of cash around.

252
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:34,475
- How long is the trip to Mycenae?
- A whole day, madam.

253
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:39,979
<i>"Semper fi,"</i> huh?

254
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,148
<i>You a marine?</i>

255
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:47,383
No.
Infantry...

256
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:50,387
-<i> army.</i>
- Yeah.

257
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:52,455
It's funny, you know?

258
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:55,492
<i>All that time over here
during the war,</i>

259
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:58,128
I could give a shit
about Europe.

260
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:59,998
Yet here I am again.

261
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:05,004
Here's the deal:

262
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:08,320
I could care less about
your other investors.

263
00:15:10,107 --> 00:15:12,176
You reimburse my clients,

264
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,710
I'll go back home to my family

265
00:15:13,711 --> 00:15:16,080
and leave you
and your lovely wife alone.

266
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,481
My wife has nothing
to do with this.

267
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:22,720
Look, why don't
you and I go downstairs,

268
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,488
have a drink,

269
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:27,428
see if we can come
to an arrangement?

270
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:33,323
Unfortunately, I'm not authorized
to negotiate with you.

271
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:37,368
I'm just here for the money.

272
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,538
Yeah.

273
00:15:40,538 --> 00:15:42,373
Okay, well,

274
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,076
let me go and get it.

275
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:49,147
Chester?

276
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:56,355
-<i> Chester?</i>
- Don't come in!

277
00:15:57,355 --> 00:15:59,089
- Hello. Hi.
- Hello.

278
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,191
I need to return something
to some friends of mine,

279
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:03,460
- the McFarlands.
- They're in room 505.

280
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:05,495
505, okay.

281
00:16:05,496 --> 00:16:08,331
- Is there a phone I can use?
- The house phone is right over there.

282
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:09,400
Ah, thank you.

283
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:31,788
Don't answer it!
Don't answer it.

284
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:34,524
- What's happening?
- He's fine. He fell.

285
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:37,260
He hit his head pretty bad.
I've got to take him downstairs,

286
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:39,396
get him some help.

287
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:41,555
I thought you said
no one would follow us.

288
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,311
Open the door!

289
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:56,844
Get dressed, start packing. We've
gotta get out of here right away.

290
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,444
Oh God.

291
00:17:32,116 --> 00:17:33,484
No.

292
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:55,271
Can you, uh...
can you help me

293
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:57,517
<i>get this guy's door open?</i>

294
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:08,418
-<i> What happened?</i>
- He's hammered, that's what happened.

295
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:10,488
I found him in the lobby.

296
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:18,464
Good evening.

297
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:21,464
Evening.

298
00:18:24,202 --> 00:18:26,672
Easy, like this.

299
00:18:27,672 --> 00:18:28,939
Oh Christ.

300
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,606
- Is he okay?
- He'll be fine.

301
00:18:30,607 --> 00:18:34,210
He's gonna have an almighty
hangover tomorrow though.

302
00:18:34,211 --> 00:18:36,948
Who is he?

303
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,386
I haven't the foggiest idea.

304
00:18:42,386 --> 00:18:44,453
Some drunk.

305
00:18:44,454 --> 00:18:47,658
He tried to paw Colette in the elevator,
then followed us to our room,

306
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,265
<i>so I smacked him.</i>

307
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:55,687
Let's let him sleep it off.

308
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:04,644
Oh.

309
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:09,278
Your wife left it in the cab.

310
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,551
I was bringing it back.

311
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:16,423
The truth is...

312
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,225
I owe some people money.

313
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:24,329
They sent him to
threaten us with a gun.

314
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:27,532
Look.

315
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:29,967
I don't know what to do.

316
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,769
I mean, I...
I don't know...

317
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:35,538
if he's alone or there's
somebody else in the lobby.

318
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:37,803
All I know is we gotta
get out of this hotel

319
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:40,248
before that man wakes up.

320
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,758
Can you help us?

321
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:55,645
Thank you.

322
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,649
<i>Sorry, it's not the grand.</i>

323
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,488
It's perfect.
It feels like New York.

324
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,488
Oh, is that you?

325
00:20:26,023 --> 00:20:27,524
<i>Yeah, with my dad.</i>

326
00:20:27,525 --> 00:20:28,825
Is he back home?

327
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:30,458
Uh, he passed away a month ago.

328
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:34,740
I'm sorry.

329
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,048
<i>So, uh, have you</i>

330
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:53,749
<i>figured out who he is yet?</i>

331
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,453
Private detective.

332
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:57,621
<i>I got in trouble with a...</i>

333
00:20:57,622 --> 00:21:00,056
Gambling syndicate back home.

334
00:21:00,057 --> 00:21:02,459
<i>Made some investments for 'em</i>

335
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,095
that didn't work out.

336
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:07,065
Sent this guy after us.

337
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:10,633
God knows who else.

338
00:21:10,634 --> 00:21:13,502
Well, the airport opens up
in a few hours.

339
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:15,605
<i>You'll be gone
before the guy wakes up.</i>

340
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:19,375
Hotel took our passports
when we checked in.

341
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:21,846
- You don't have your passports?
-<i> Nope.</i>

342
00:21:22,503 --> 00:21:25,082
Well, I... I mean I can try
to go get 'em for you,

343
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,963
<i>but I don't think
they're gonna give 'em to me.</i>

344
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:28,785
Naw naw, it wouldn't
be safe anyway.

345
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:30,824
Might be more of 'em
waiting for us.

346
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,691
I don't know. I gotta
get Colette outta here.

347
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:39,531
<i>We need new passports,
new identities.</i>

348
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:44,633
I have a friend that I get
American cigarettes from.

349
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:47,574
He might know somebody
that could help you out.

350
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:13,396
You okay?

351
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:14,936
No.

352
00:22:19,936 --> 00:22:22,173
He's gonna help us.

353
00:22:23,173 --> 00:22:25,541
We'll fly outta here soon.

354
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:27,913
Where?

355
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:30,151
We'll see.

356
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,859
I'm sorry.

357
00:22:51,635 --> 00:22:53,906
<i>Chester?</i>

358
00:22:55,906 --> 00:22:57,980
<i>We should go.</i>

359
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:13,656
Okay, my friend

360
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:17,664
can arrange the new passports
for $1,000... each.

361
00:23:20,664 --> 00:23:22,531
So...

362
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:24,934
Half now,

363
00:23:24,935 --> 00:23:26,671
half on delivery or...?

364
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:33,943
- Niko...
- excuse me.

365
00:23:33,944 --> 00:23:36,813
When will the passports
be ready?

366
00:23:36,814 --> 00:23:38,781
Mmm, five days.

367
00:23:38,782 --> 00:23:40,483
- No no.
-<i> Maybe four.</i>

368
00:23:40,484 --> 00:23:42,487
We can't hang around
Athens that long.

369
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:55,632
For another $1,000...

370
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:57,701
He can deliver
the passports to Crete.

371
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,970
- Crete?
-<i> Yeah, no one's gonna look for you there.</i>

372
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,037
Well, that's...

373
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:04,841
I mean, I don't know Crete
from a hole in the ground.

374
00:24:04,842 --> 00:24:07,778
Where am I gonna...

375
00:24:09,513 --> 00:24:11,981
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
What did he say?

376
00:24:11,982 --> 00:24:13,062
What's the matter?
No no no.

377
00:24:13,063 --> 00:24:14,985
I should come with you.

378
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,920
- What?
-<i> I should come with you.</i>

379
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:19,556
- No no no.
- You're not gonna know your way around.

380
00:24:19,557 --> 00:24:20,594
I can go with you.

381
00:24:23,594 --> 00:24:24,830
You would do that?

382
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,632
Yes.

383
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,534
I'd certainly make it
worth your while.

384
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,568
It's okay, it's...
it's not about the money.

385
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:34,304
No, I know, but you deserve...

386
00:24:34,305 --> 00:24:36,674
<i>you have to pay him
another $500.</i>

387
00:24:37,674 --> 00:24:40,279
<i>500...
so 1500 more?</i>

388
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:43,297
Yeah.

389
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,455
Did you give him
any money for the drinks?

390
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:04,099
I offered.

391
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:06,835
Well, you should have insisted.

392
00:25:06,836 --> 00:25:08,837
He's probably
too proud to accept.

393
00:25:08,838 --> 00:25:12,911
Trust me, he's doing fine.

394
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:15,578
What's that supposed to mean?

395
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:17,780
It means he already
skimmed his commission.

396
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:19,729
Why else do you think
he's helping us?

397
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:21,884
I'm sure it's not
just the money.

398
00:25:21,885 --> 00:25:23,987
No?

399
00:25:23,988 --> 00:25:26,791
I think he's also
got a thing for you.

400
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:29,692
Either way, we need him...

401
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:32,095
At least for a few more days.

402
00:25:32,096 --> 00:25:34,931
- Hey, buddy.
- Coffee's cold and the beer's warm.

403
00:25:34,932 --> 00:25:36,836
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

404
00:25:39,436 --> 00:25:41,805
- Thanks.
- Anything interesting in the newspaper?

405
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,438
Greeks and Turks are at
each other's throats again.

406
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:04,393
Hey, honey, do you mind going in

407
00:26:04,394 --> 00:26:06,699
and seeing what's
taking him so long?

408
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:09,699
Please?

409
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,731
<i>What gives?</i> Well, we can't check
in without all three passports.

410
00:26:42,732 --> 00:26:44,701
- Why not?
- It's a legal requirement.

411
00:26:44,702 --> 00:26:46,702
Apparently, it's the same
everywhere in Iraklion.

412
00:26:46,703 --> 00:26:47,970
But if we go to a smaller town,

413
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:50,406
they might be more
relaxed about the rules.

414
00:26:50,407 --> 00:26:52,842
- Where'd you have in mind?
- Chania.

415
00:26:52,843 --> 00:26:54,743
It's up the coast
and there's a bus

416
00:26:54,744 --> 00:26:56,712
that leaves first thing
in the morning.

417
00:26:56,713 --> 00:26:57,815
- In the morning?
- Yeah.

418
00:26:58,015 --> 00:27:01,451
We could stay up.
It's warm enough.

419
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:03,400
And you can leave
your suitcases here.

420
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,922
Uh, no.

421
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:07,698
<i>I think I'll hang on to them.</i>

422
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:16,132
My father almost
had a heart attack

423
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:19,868
when I left home. He said, "New
York has turned its back on God."

424
00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:22,439
"And you should be
very careful, young lady."

425
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,443
Oh lord.

426
00:27:26,443 --> 00:27:29,112
Taverna Asterion...
what is "Asterion"?

427
00:27:29,113 --> 00:27:31,448
Asterius is a minotaur.

428
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,219
So Asterion would have been...

429
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:37,053
Grandfather.

430
00:27:37,054 --> 00:27:39,922
Actually, it's the same name.
Asterius, Asterion...

431
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:42,791
it's just a different pronunciation.
It means the same thing.

432
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:44,993
-<i> But it is confusing.</i>
- Mmm.

433
00:27:44,994 --> 00:27:46,098
Who knew?

434
00:27:48,098 --> 00:27:51,034
- Where did you live?
- On Hudson and 11th.

435
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:53,068
<i>I shared an apartment
with three Barnard...</i>

436
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:55,838
I'm fading. I don't know if
I can stay up much longer.

437
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:58,911
Well, order some coffee.

438
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:02,859
I think I'm gonna have
another scotch.

439
00:28:06,182 --> 00:28:07,814
So how did the two of you meet?

440
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:12,489
<i>I crashed one of his
parties with a girlfriend.</i>

441
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,223
It was like nothing
I'd ever seen.

442
00:28:14,224 --> 00:28:17,160
There was champagne and caviar

443
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:19,162
and millionaires everywhere.

444
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:20,865
Garcon!

445
00:28:21,634 --> 00:28:23,266
May I have a cigarette, please?

446
00:28:23,267 --> 00:28:24,770
Whiskey.

447
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,839
And a whiskey.

448
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:31,007
<i>Thank you.</i>

449
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:32,061
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

450
00:28:34,044 --> 00:28:35,314
You must be awfully...

451
00:28:37,314 --> 00:28:39,982
Good at languages to pick
up Greek so quickly.

452
00:28:39,983 --> 00:28:42,085
I had a head start.
My father

453
00:28:42,086 --> 00:28:44,220
made me and my sisters
learn different languages

454
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:46,055
since we could
practically speak,

455
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:48,324
so every month it would
be a different language...

456
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:50,093
French and then Italian,

457
00:28:50,094 --> 00:28:52,060
- then Russian.
- Russian?

458
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:54,530
Can I keep the bottle?

459
00:28:54,531 --> 00:28:57,133
<i>And the thing is when he'd
overhear us speaking English</i>

460
00:28:57,134 --> 00:29:00,103
we'd get demerits. There was
this chart in the hall.

461
00:29:00,104 --> 00:29:02,874
Even my poor mother would
get on it now and then.

462
00:29:03,874 --> 00:29:05,348
And what did your father do?

463
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:11,047
He was a Professor
of archeology at Harvard.

464
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:12,548
- Wow.
- Yeah.

465
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:14,217
He certainly thought so.

466
00:29:14,218 --> 00:29:15,288
And you don't?

467
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:21,257
Listen, my old man drove
a truck for a living.

468
00:29:21,258 --> 00:29:24,259
He didn't teach us very good
English, never mind French

469
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,998
<i>or Russian.</i>

470
00:29:27,998 --> 00:29:30,066
Impressive.

471
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:31,904
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

472
00:29:33,904 --> 00:29:35,238
It is.

473
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:36,239
I'd like to dance.

474
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:38,908
Okay, yeah, all right.

475
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:40,876
May I finish my scotch first?

476
00:29:40,877 --> 00:29:42,312
Rydal?

477
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:43,317
Uh...

478
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:47,317
Knock yourself out.

479
00:30:26,056 --> 00:30:28,091
Are you all right?

480
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,659
Yeah.

481
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,187
- Let me help you.
- I got it!

482
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:40,105
Honey... honey!

483
00:30:42,105 --> 00:30:44,207
I just want to sit here

484
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:47,242
- and finish my cigarette.
- Are you sure you're all right?

485
00:30:47,243 --> 00:30:49,916
Stop asking me that!

486
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:55,084
The bus leaves in a few hours.

487
00:30:55,085 --> 00:30:56,251
We'll just...

488
00:30:56,252 --> 00:30:58,354
Have to hang in there.

489
00:30:58,355 --> 00:31:00,038
Go ahead, I'll catch up.

490
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,139
- Hey, I hope that...
- you know what?

491
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,441
Just run along, Rydal.

492
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:20,250
<i>Run along.</i>

493
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:36,710
I bet you wish you never met us.

494
00:31:37,027 --> 00:31:39,295
No.

495
00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:40,296
No, I'm glad I did.

496
00:31:51,107 --> 00:31:52,711
<i>He's mad at himself.</i>

497
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,315
Not you.

498
00:32:06,323 --> 00:32:08,125
Shit.

499
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,242
Oh.

500
00:33:28,505 --> 00:33:30,806
Uh,<i> kafe parakalo.</i>

501
00:33:30,807 --> 00:33:32,374
Kafe?

502
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:33,811
And, uh...

503
00:33:34,811 --> 00:33:36,144
One of them.

504
00:33:36,145 --> 00:33:37,814
- Donut?
- Donut.

505
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,304
Yeah, donut.

506
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,175
Morning.

507
00:34:08,244 --> 00:34:11,550
I brought you a Greek donut.

508
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,126
Thanks.

509
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,365
It's good.

510
00:34:29,365 --> 00:34:31,399
<i>I heard the sea when I woke up</i>

511
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,558
<i>and I thought we were back at
the beach house on long island.</i>

512
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:40,642
Hey.

513
00:34:40,643 --> 00:34:42,678
When we get our new passports,

514
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,881
<i>I'll straighten things out
with those guys in New York.</i>

515
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:48,216
We'll be home soon.

516
00:34:48,217 --> 00:34:49,685
<i>Morning.</i>

517
00:34:49,686 --> 00:34:51,453
- Morning.
- Ahem.

518
00:34:51,454 --> 00:34:54,457
Oh whew.
We should get going

519
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:56,217
if we're gonna catch the bus.

520
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,399
- Thanks.
- Hey, Rydal?

521
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,334
How long are we stopping here?

522
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:42,546
I don't know. It depends how long
the bus driver takes to eat.

523
00:35:51,648 --> 00:35:54,317
Can I get you something?

524
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,588
Uh...

525
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:00,288
Yeah, a beer'd be nice.

526
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:01,756
Okay.
I got it.

527
00:36:01,757 --> 00:36:03,459
Hey, Rydal?

528
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,460
Uh...

529
00:36:07,364 --> 00:36:10,302
I want to apologize for last night.
I was out of line.

530
00:36:12,302 --> 00:36:15,706
Colette told me your dad passed
away recently. I didn't know.

531
00:36:16,706 --> 00:36:18,286
I'm sorry.

532
00:37:56,806 --> 00:37:59,442
<i>He died.
It's all over the news.</i>

533
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,511
You have to turn yourself in.
It was self-defense.

534
00:38:02,512 --> 00:38:04,516
They mention any suspects?

535
00:38:06,314 --> 00:38:08,683
No, but they have...
they have your passports.

536
00:38:08,684 --> 00:38:11,453
It's just a matter of time.
If you turn yourself in...

537
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:13,891
they'll arrest you
as an accomplice.

538
00:38:15,891 --> 00:38:19,562
Witnesses saw both of us with
the body in the hotel hallway.

539
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,763
You arranged
fake passports for us.

540
00:38:21,764 --> 00:38:23,866
- No no no.
- You accompanied us to Crete.

541
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:27,703
And now you're carrying what? An extra
$1,000 of my money in your pocket?

542
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:29,538
I'm trying to help you.

543
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:31,707
I know.

544
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:33,808
I know you are.

545
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:35,382
Did you know he was dead?

546
00:38:40,483 --> 00:38:42,118
Colette doesn't.

547
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,014
I'd prefer it
if she didn't find out.

548
00:39:12,748 --> 00:39:15,853
I'm finally in a good mood
and now you two are sulking.

549
00:39:16,853 --> 00:39:18,889
<i>What's the matter?</i>

550
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:23,197
- I'm just a little tired.
- I bet I can make you laugh.

551
00:39:36,654 --> 00:39:38,707
Oh, finish your O-Zo
and I'll try again.

552
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:40,176
It's "ouzo."

553
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:42,645
O-u-z-o.
Four letters.

554
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,916
Well, it tastes like
gasoline to me.

555
00:39:46,677 --> 00:39:48,783
Hey, you want to share
some oysters, hon?

556
00:39:48,784 --> 00:39:51,453
The guidebook says it's a bad
idea to eat shellfish here.

557
00:39:51,454 --> 00:39:53,855
The Greeks have only been doing
it for thousands of years,

558
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,792
but I'm sure your parochial
guidebook's probably right.

559
00:39:56,793 --> 00:40:00,663
Better to eat shellfish
from some dirty New York kitchen

560
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,797
than right here by the sea where
it's caught in front of your eyes.

561
00:40:02,798 --> 00:40:04,899
- I wish I was in New York right now.
- Oh, skip it.

562
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,803
Of course we can't
go back to New York.

563
00:40:07,003 --> 00:40:09,538
We can't go anywhere in the states
because Chester's business ventures

564
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:11,674
- have been such a huge success.
- There's three of us here at the table.

565
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:13,035
I'm sure Rydal doesn't
want to hear

566
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,509
you whine about
how homesick you are.

567
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,950
All right, why don't you
lay off her?

568
00:40:15,951 --> 00:40:18,848
Who, my wife?

569
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,018
- Don't rise to it.
- No, let him.

570
00:40:22,018 --> 00:40:23,597
Let's hear what's on his mind.

571
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,698
Don't you ever speak
to me like that again.

572
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:37,699
Or what?

573
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:49,245
Are we gonna talk about this?

574
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:52,987
We had an argument.
There's nothing to talk about.

575
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:58,989
Are you sure?

576
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:02,561
Is there gonna be another
black mark against me?

577
00:41:08,197 --> 00:41:10,799
Look, I got upset because
I don't like you discussing

578
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,067
my business in front of him.
He could use it against us.

579
00:41:13,068 --> 00:41:15,037
Oh.
That's ridiculous.

580
00:41:15,038 --> 00:41:18,943
Is it? He's done
nothing but lie to us.

581
00:41:19,893 --> 00:41:22,578
I mean do you believe any
of that Harvard Yale crap?

582
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:23,632
I don't really care.

583
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:26,717
It's not like we've been
straight with him.

584
00:41:27,449 --> 00:41:28,818
Why are you defending him?

585
00:41:29,018 --> 00:41:31,690
Because I like him.

586
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:36,297
And I appreciate
what he's doing for us.

587
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:42,699
You like him.

588
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:46,304
I didn't mean it like that.

589
00:42:28,844 --> 00:42:30,145
<i>Nai?</i>

590
00:42:30,146 --> 00:42:31,684
<i>It's me.</i>

591
00:42:34,684 --> 00:42:36,619
One second.

592
00:42:45,661 --> 00:42:47,629
- Hi.
- Hi.

593
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,098
Just thought I'd take a walk,

594
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,133
but I don't know what there is
to see in this town.

595
00:42:51,134 --> 00:42:53,702
Uh, ruins.

596
00:42:56,773 --> 00:42:58,707
Your room's smaller than ours.

597
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:00,235
Well, there's only one of me.

598
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,977
Anything interesting happening

599
00:43:02,978 --> 00:43:05,046
- in the outside world?
- Uh...

600
00:43:05,047 --> 00:43:07,783
Soccer.

601
00:43:07,784 --> 00:43:09,984
- Where's Chester?
-<i> Oh, he was up all night.</i>

602
00:43:09,985 --> 00:43:12,889
He's taken a sleeping pill.

603
00:43:13,889 --> 00:43:15,056
Hmm.

604
00:43:15,057 --> 00:43:17,725
You keep a diary?

605
00:43:17,726 --> 00:43:20,395
Yeah, it's just
notes for my work.

606
00:43:20,396 --> 00:43:22,967
Anything about me and Chester?

607
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:26,414
Maybe there's a line or two.

608
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,150
You coming with me?

609
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:45,888
For a walk.

610
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:48,226
Sure, yeah, I'll come with you.

611
00:43:51,226 --> 00:43:53,701
Good.

612
00:44:03,873 --> 00:44:05,719
Sweetie?

613
00:45:34,864 --> 00:45:37,799
Uh, excuse me.

614
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,567
I have no idea where I am.

615
00:45:39,568 --> 00:45:42,203
I, uh...
how do I get downtown?

616
00:45:42,204 --> 00:45:45,140
<i>Kentro... Citta?</i>

617
00:45:45,141 --> 00:45:47,181
You know,
where the people gather?

618
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:52,547
Whiskey?

619
00:45:52,548 --> 00:45:53,548
Whiskey.

620
00:46:01,157 --> 00:46:03,477
Tell the driver that
I just want to drive around.

621
00:46:03,478 --> 00:46:04,892
- I'm looking for my wife.
- Okay.

622
00:46:04,893 --> 00:46:06,227
Wife, sure, yes.

623
00:46:06,228 --> 00:46:08,163
- Go inside.
- Okay.

624
00:46:08,164 --> 00:46:09,897
Oh, my friend, you pay first.

625
00:46:09,898 --> 00:46:11,600
- Pay first?
- Yes!

626
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:13,868
- How much is it?
- I show you, I show you, I show you.

627
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:16,305
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

628
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,426
- I don't know where I'm going. Just tell him...
- 50.

629
00:46:18,427 --> 00:46:20,576
50 yeah, okay.
Thanks.

630
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:22,858
- Go inside.
- You understand I just want to drive around?

631
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:24,175
Good luck with your wife.

632
00:46:30,286 --> 00:46:32,321
Hang on, stop stop
stop stop stop.

633
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,322
Stop stop.

634
00:46:39,195 --> 00:46:42,064
Colette!

635
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:44,603
Colette!

636
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:49,104
Oh, I'm sorry.

637
00:46:49,105 --> 00:46:50,407
Hey!

638
00:46:52,407 --> 00:46:54,279
Son of a bitch!

639
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:03,186
He punched me, he punched me!

640
00:47:04,186 --> 00:47:06,622
Stop, stop stop,
the cops are here.

641
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,362
Go.
Get out of here!

642
00:47:16,274 --> 00:47:17,801
Ah, he just
sucker-punched me.

643
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,433
Shh, come on, shh, come on.

644
00:47:19,434 --> 00:47:21,314
- Where the hell were you, anyway?
- Be careful.

645
00:47:21,315 --> 00:47:23,638
- Where have you guys been?
- Shh, please please calm down.

646
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:25,339
- Did you sleep with him?
- Shh. No.

647
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,442
You see what he's doing?
He's trying to tear us apart

648
00:47:27,443 --> 00:47:29,444
- this whole trip!
- No! Calm down.

649
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:32,247
He told you, didn't he?
Did he tell you?

650
00:47:32,248 --> 00:47:34,316
- What are you talking about?
- He was...

651
00:47:34,317 --> 00:47:36,951
- told me what?
- The guy hit his head!

652
00:47:36,952 --> 00:47:39,690
All right? He had a gun,
what am I supposed to do?

653
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:43,638
I was trying to protect you.
I was trying to protect you.

654
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:47,664
Forget it.
Forget it.

655
00:48:11,186 --> 00:48:12,687
Why didn't you tell me?

656
00:48:12,688 --> 00:48:14,422
He asked me not to say anything.

657
00:48:14,423 --> 00:48:17,494
- He thought that you would panic.
- He killed someone!

658
00:48:18,494 --> 00:48:20,294
Why would you lie for him?

659
00:48:20,295 --> 00:48:22,268
I didn't do it for him.

660
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:27,744
You shouldn't have done it
for either of us.

661
00:48:34,744 --> 00:48:37,715
Those people that are after
him... what did he do?

662
00:48:39,715 --> 00:48:41,452
He swindled them.

663
00:48:43,452 --> 00:48:46,242
<i>He sold them shares in an oil
field that didn't exist.</i>

664
00:48:49,025 --> 00:48:51,728
<i>Them and hundreds
of other people.</i>

665
00:48:52,728 --> 00:48:54,199
How much did you know?

666
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,210
He's my husband.

667
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,210
I'll call my friend
in the morning,

668
00:49:09,211 --> 00:49:11,248
see if your passports are ready.

669
00:49:12,248 --> 00:49:13,751
<i>Then what?</i>

670
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:18,053
Hide some place else?
Change our names?

671
00:49:18,054 --> 00:49:20,190
I can't live like that anymore.

672
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:23,559
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

673
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,498
<i>I just wanna go home.</i>

674
00:49:40,809 --> 00:49:43,284
I didn't know.

675
00:49:49,284 --> 00:49:50,788
...Niko.

676
00:49:56,291 --> 00:49:58,259
I think it's better
if you and Colette

677
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,593
don't sit next to each other.

678
00:49:59,594 --> 00:50:02,129
Why don't you and I
sit together?

679
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:04,108
Do you mind, sweetie?

680
00:51:41,197 --> 00:51:43,666
- Oh shit.
- What?

681
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:45,666
Hey.

682
00:51:50,606 --> 00:51:52,481
Oh, for Pete's sake.

683
00:51:59,481 --> 00:52:00,515
Hey!

684
00:52:00,516 --> 00:52:02,716
Hey!

685
00:52:02,717 --> 00:52:05,520
- What the hell's going on?
- She thinks they recognized her.

686
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:07,355
Nobody recognized you.

687
00:52:07,356 --> 00:52:09,723
- She says they recognized her.
- Get back on the bus!

688
00:52:09,724 --> 00:52:12,928
- No! Get your hands off of me!
- Let's go! Get back on the fucking bus!

689
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:15,699
This is all your fault!
Don't blame me.

690
00:52:16,699 --> 00:52:18,536
- Listen here...
- okay.

691
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:41,423
- I'm sorry.
- Don't touch me.

692
00:53:49,557 --> 00:53:51,359
You should get some rest.

693
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,360
You get some rest.

694
00:53:54,063 --> 00:53:55,382
I'm fine.

695
00:54:14,382 --> 00:54:16,065
I'm gonna have a look around.

696
00:54:50,686 --> 00:54:52,887
Hey! Wake up.
Let's go.

697
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,526
Come on, wake up, sweetie.
Let's go.

698
00:54:59,527 --> 00:55:01,738
Let's get you out of the rain.
We gotta go.

699
00:55:31,726 --> 00:55:33,627
Thanks.

700
00:55:33,628 --> 00:55:35,629
I'm gonna go see if there's
somewhere we can rest.

701
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,894
I'll be right back.

702
00:56:05,894 --> 00:56:09,464
Colette.

703
00:56:09,465 --> 00:56:12,933
Chester?

704
00:56:12,934 --> 00:56:16,604
- Chester!
- I'm gonna go look for him, okay?

705
00:56:16,605 --> 00:56:19,195
Stay here.

706
00:56:40,195 --> 00:56:41,871
<i>Chester?</i>

707
00:56:49,871 --> 00:56:51,539
Chester?

708
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:46,864
Rydal?

709
00:57:52,867 --> 00:57:54,940
Did you find him?

710
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:01,743
- Where's Rydal?
- Forget about Rydal.

711
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:03,713
What have you done to him?

712
00:58:04,713 --> 00:58:06,281
Nothing.

713
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:07,681
Come on, let's go.

714
00:58:07,682 --> 00:58:10,285
- Tell me.
- He's fine!

715
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:12,854
- Where is he?
- We don't need him.

716
00:58:12,855 --> 00:58:15,290
Look, I'm sorry.
I know I screwed up.

717
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:17,792
I'll make it up to you.
We can start over.

718
00:58:17,793 --> 00:58:19,694
- It's too late.
- Don't say that!

719
00:58:19,695 --> 00:58:21,563
God!

720
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:24,032
Colette!

721
00:58:56,331 --> 00:58:58,732
Oh. Oh no.

722
00:58:58,733 --> 00:59:01,669
No. No. No.

723
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:04,372
No. No no! God, no!

724
00:59:04,373 --> 00:59:05,974
No! No! No!

725
00:59:09,677 --> 00:59:11,813
Oh no. No.

726
00:59:59,795 --> 01:00:00,795
Where's Rydal?

727
01:00:02,864 --> 01:00:04,668
He ran away with my wife.

728
01:00:06,668 --> 01:00:08,007
You got my passport?

729
01:00:16,844 --> 01:00:19,989
Another 2500, like we agreed.

730
01:00:33,195 --> 01:00:36,032
- You see the newspapers?
- Mm-hmm.

731
01:00:37,032 --> 01:00:39,067
Could be a problem for me.

732
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,068
Yeah.

733
01:00:43,038 --> 01:00:46,184
But a much bigger problem
if I get caught.

734
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:43,253
Oh God.

735
01:05:11,706 --> 01:05:14,308
The truth is
we're joined at the hip.

736
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:17,178
I get caught, I take you down.

737
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:20,180
You get caught, you turn me in.

738
01:05:20,181 --> 01:05:23,750
<i>Guess you must've thought of that
or you would've gone to the cops.</i>

739
01:05:23,751 --> 01:05:26,123
You have no idea
what I'm thinking.

740
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:29,923
I know you wouldn't be here
if you didn't have

741
01:05:29,924 --> 01:05:32,192
a little larceny in your veins.

742
01:05:32,193 --> 01:05:34,261
How much do you want?

743
01:05:34,262 --> 01:05:36,062
I don't know.
You were married to her.

744
01:05:36,063 --> 01:05:37,906
How much do you think
she was worth?

745
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:47,774
I'll give you $5,000.

746
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:51,757
Oh, I bet you have a lot more
than that in your suitcase.

747
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,061
10,000.
That's it.

748
01:06:06,061 --> 01:06:07,463
I don't want your money.

749
01:06:09,463 --> 01:06:11,367
I wanted your wife.

750
01:06:22,476 --> 01:06:27,119
Don't you ever mention
my wife again!

751
01:06:47,802 --> 01:06:49,570
Whoo.

752
01:08:44,485 --> 01:08:46,257
Hmm?

753
01:08:50,257 --> 01:08:52,529
Over there? Okay okay.

754
01:08:54,529 --> 01:08:56,431
Shit.

755
01:09:24,525 --> 01:09:25,525
Oh.

756
01:09:29,264 --> 01:09:31,369
Come on, come on, come on.

757
01:09:35,369 --> 01:09:36,636
You live in Crete?

758
01:09:36,637 --> 01:09:38,639
No, I'm an American.

759
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,711
Traveling alone?

760
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:45,782
Uh, no.
No no, I'm...

761
01:09:53,721 --> 01:09:55,689
<i>Hey!</i>

762
01:10:10,738 --> 01:10:13,506
- Yes?
- Is this your son?

763
01:10:13,507 --> 01:10:15,011
Uh, well...

764
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:18,414
Dad, he wants to know
if I'm traveling alone.

765
01:10:20,414 --> 01:10:22,416
Yes sir. I...

766
01:10:22,417 --> 01:10:25,391
we were just in separate lines.

767
01:10:30,391 --> 01:10:31,831
Is there a problem?

768
01:10:36,831 --> 01:10:38,666
No, you can go.

769
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:40,501
Thank you.

770
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:42,639
Thank you, sir.

771
01:10:44,639 --> 01:10:47,073
Don't do anything stupid.

772
01:10:47,074 --> 01:10:49,380
Get your hands off me.

773
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:54,047
Now what?

774
01:10:54,048 --> 01:10:56,720
- I'm going to the airport.
- Me too.

775
01:11:15,448 --> 01:11:16,870
<i>Are they talking about her?</i>

776
01:11:16,871 --> 01:11:18,578
- What are they saying?
- Shh!

777
01:11:23,578 --> 01:11:25,679
They think she was robbed.

778
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:28,782
They didn't find
anything on her.

779
01:11:28,783 --> 01:11:31,757
What else?

780
01:11:36,757 --> 01:11:38,547
Who are they describing,
you or me?

781
01:12:13,661 --> 01:12:15,466
- Do you speak English?
- Yes sir.

782
01:12:18,466 --> 01:12:20,134
- What's your name?
- Kynthia.

783
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:23,438
Kynthia?
Very nice.

784
01:12:25,472 --> 01:12:27,608
Bobby, Bobby Weidican.

785
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:29,410
We, uh...

786
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:31,879
we'd like two seats
on the Frankfurt flight.

787
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,480
Let me check, sir.

788
01:12:43,891 --> 01:12:46,260
Go sit down and I'll take
care of the tickets.

789
01:12:46,927 --> 01:12:48,170
Give me your passport.

790
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,679
Just a second, sir.

791
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,679
Frankfurt, huh?

792
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,854
Yeah, didn't your old man
teach you German?

793
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:48,988
You know, I saw a picture
of you with your father

794
01:13:48,989 --> 01:13:50,927
in your little poem book.

795
01:13:53,927 --> 01:13:55,996
Looked like he cared
a lot about you.

796
01:13:55,997 --> 01:13:57,801
Looks can be deceiving.

797
01:13:59,801 --> 01:14:03,939
Oh yeah.

798
01:14:05,939 --> 01:14:08,844
Why didn't you go
to his funeral?

799
01:14:09,844 --> 01:14:11,897
'Cause he wouldn't
have wanted me there.

800
01:14:15,015 --> 01:14:16,849
The problem is

801
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:19,719
we expect too much from them.

802
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:23,924
When I was a kid, I looked up
at my father like he was a God.

803
01:14:23,925 --> 01:14:25,027
Then you grow up...

804
01:14:26,027 --> 01:14:29,698
And they disappoint you
a little more every day.

805
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:37,603
Where are you going?

806
01:14:37,604 --> 01:14:41,541
I'm gonna get a drink.
You want something?

807
01:14:41,542 --> 01:14:43,761
- Coffee?
- No.

808
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:25,978
<i>Welcome aboard
flight OA 180 to Istanbul.</i>

809
01:16:25,979 --> 01:16:28,982
<i>Our captain has informed me
that our flight time will be</i>

810
01:16:28,983 --> 01:16:32,788
<i>approximately
one hour and 30 minutes.</i>

811
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:35,252
<i>Guess you should've killed me
when you had the chance?</i>

812
01:17:38,252 --> 01:17:41,455
- Where are you calling from?
-<i> Oh, right across the bridge.</i>

813
01:17:41,456 --> 01:17:43,756
How'd you find me?

814
01:17:43,757 --> 01:17:45,892
<i>I asked the girl
at the ticket counter.</i>

815
01:17:45,893 --> 01:17:49,496
<i>Kynthia, wasn't it?</i>

816
01:17:49,497 --> 01:17:53,037
<i>Then I called every hotel in town, Mr.
Weidican.</i>

817
01:17:56,037 --> 01:17:57,504
<i>I want the money...</i>

818
01:17:57,505 --> 01:17:59,773
<i>all of it...</i>

819
01:17:59,774 --> 01:18:01,907
<i>or I'm gonna give your new
identity to the feds.</i>

820
01:18:01,908 --> 01:18:03,809
Listen, why don't you come over

821
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:05,812
and we can have
a drink and talk about it.

822
01:18:06,012 --> 01:18:09,081
<i>I don't think so.
Café sultan,</i>

823
01:18:09,082 --> 01:18:11,240
<i>jewelry quarter,
grand bazaar, 20 minutes.</i>

824
01:18:12,019 --> 01:18:15,122
<i>You shouldn't have tried
to frame me for her murder.</i>

825
01:18:26,067 --> 01:18:27,752
We're gonna need a confession...

826
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:31,202
- Or the deal's off.
- Yeah, I know.

827
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:36,569
You want something to drink?

828
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:38,573
I'm afraid
they don't serve alcohol.

829
01:19:40,207 --> 01:19:43,377
I'll have whatever
you're having.

830
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:48,538
I see your old man
taught you Turkish too.

831
01:19:51,118 --> 01:19:53,053
You might find
this hard to believe,

832
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:54,423
but I missed your company.

833
01:19:54,836 --> 01:19:56,889
You're the only person
left in the world

834
01:19:56,890 --> 01:19:58,890
I can have an honest
conversation with.

835
01:20:01,194 --> 01:20:05,197
- You have it on you?
- Mm-hmm.

836
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:07,300
10,000.
It's all I have.

837
01:20:07,301 --> 01:20:08,354
No, 10,000 won't do.

838
01:20:12,873 --> 01:20:15,274
You should be paying me.
When we first met,

839
01:20:15,275 --> 01:20:17,376
you were shortchanging
college girls.

840
01:20:17,377 --> 01:20:21,081
Now look at you...
a real criminal.

841
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:22,661
There's something else I want.

842
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:28,408
I want a picture of Colette.

843
01:20:48,408 --> 01:20:50,645
Take your pick.

844
01:20:58,085 --> 01:20:59,954
Was that even her real name?

845
01:21:00,954 --> 01:21:01,954
Colette?

846
01:21:05,693 --> 01:21:08,127
Why'd you try and frame me?

847
01:21:08,128 --> 01:21:09,931
Do you really have to ask?

848
01:21:10,931 --> 01:21:12,469
Because she liked me?

849
01:21:15,469 --> 01:21:17,176
You know I slept with her.

850
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,247
She wanted me to.

851
01:21:27,247 --> 01:21:29,114
She wanted a way out.

852
01:21:29,115 --> 01:21:30,716
That's all you meant to her...

853
01:21:30,717 --> 01:21:32,285
some callow kid

854
01:21:32,286 --> 01:21:33,687
she would've forgotten
in a minute.

855
01:21:33,688 --> 01:21:35,354
Then why did you kill her?

856
01:21:35,355 --> 01:21:37,359
She was the one thing
I cared about.

857
01:21:38,359 --> 01:21:39,993
Now why would I kill her?

858
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:45,800
I don't expect you to
understand now, but one day

859
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,200
you're gonna wake up and you're
gonna look in the mirror

860
01:21:48,201 --> 01:21:51,623
and you're gonna see someone who's
not all that different from me.

861
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:55,709
And you're gonna realize
that every hope and dream

862
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:58,243
you ever had has slipped
through your fingers.

863
01:21:58,244 --> 01:22:01,180
And all you've got,
if you're lucky,

864
01:22:01,181 --> 01:22:03,183
is someone like her.

865
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:05,720
That's what you took from me.

866
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,721
That's what I took from you?

867
01:22:08,722 --> 01:22:11,326
You tried to kill me.

868
01:22:12,326 --> 01:22:14,193
And you killed her.

869
01:22:14,194 --> 01:22:15,194
Admit it.

870
01:22:20,134 --> 01:22:21,760
Admit it.

871
01:22:50,264 --> 01:22:54,555
Let's go for a walk. I don't
wanna give you the money here.

872
01:23:15,555 --> 01:23:18,127
Welcome, sir.

873
01:23:20,127 --> 01:23:21,262
Hello.

874
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:25,712
Oh shit.

875
01:26:55,609 --> 01:26:57,582
Oh shit.

876
01:27:01,582 --> 01:27:04,349
No, wait wait. No.
Let me talk to him.

877
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:06,386
Let me talk to him!

878
01:27:37,618 --> 01:27:40,524
You wearing a wire?

879
01:27:49,796 --> 01:27:51,399
<i>My name...</i>

880
01:27:52,399 --> 01:27:54,403
Is Chester McFarland.

881
01:27:56,403 --> 01:27:58,470
<i>I'm guilty of fraud,</i>

882
01:27:58,471 --> 01:28:02,644
<i>ruining the lives of many men.</i>

883
01:28:03,644 --> 01:28:05,847
I'm responsible...

884
01:28:07,847 --> 01:28:11,122
For the death
of a private detective...

885
01:28:16,122 --> 01:28:18,592
And the death of my wife.

886
01:28:22,128 --> 01:28:24,899
Rydal keener...

887
01:28:25,899 --> 01:28:27,505
Had nothing to do with it.

888
01:28:31,505 --> 01:28:32,505
I framed him.

889
01:28:44,118 --> 01:28:47,923
Sorry I disappointed you.

890
01:29:22,756 --> 01:29:26,194
Our embassy will arrange
for your repatriation.

891
01:29:28,194 --> 01:29:29,500
You're free to go home.

892
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,768
Where will he be buried?

893
01:29:35,769 --> 01:29:38,638
We haven't been able
to trace any next of kin,

894
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,540
so he'll be buried here.

895
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:41,778
Why?

896
01:29:44,778 --> 01:29:46,515
Thought I'd go to his funeral.
