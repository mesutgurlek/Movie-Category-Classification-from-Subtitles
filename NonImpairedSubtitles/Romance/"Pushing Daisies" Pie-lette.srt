<i>At this very moment
in the town of Couer d'Couers</i>

<i>Young Ned was 9 years, 27 weeks,
6 days and 3 minutes old.</i>

00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:32,992
<i>His dog Digby was 3 years, 2 weeks,
6 days, 5 hours, and 9 minutes old.</i>

4
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:38,615
<i>And not a minute older.</i>

5
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:25,099
<i>This was the moment young Ned realized
he wasn't like the other children.</i>

6
00:01:25,446 --> 00:01:28,120
<i>Nor was he like anyone
else for that matter.</i>

7
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,866
<i>Young Ned could touch dead things
and bring them back to life.</i>

10
00:01:45,682 --> 00:01:47,798
<i>This touch was a gift given to him,</i>

11
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,815
<i>but not by anyone in particular.</i>

12
00:01:55,474 --> 00:01:59,201
<i>There was no box, no instructions,
no manufactures warantee.</i>

13
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:01,649
<i>It just was.</i>

14
00:02:03,813 --> 00:02:06,237
<i>The terms of use weren't
immediately clear,</i>

15
00:02:06,362 --> 00:02:08,986
Nor were they of immediate concerned.

16
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,083
<i>Yound Ned was in love...</i>

17
00:02:11,225 --> 00:02:12,529
<i>Her name was Chuck.</i>

18
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,576
<i>At this very moment she was 8 years
42 weeks 3 hours and 2 minutes old.</i>

19
00:02:18,343 --> 00:02:22,815
<i>Young Ned did not think of her as being
born or hatched or conceived in anyway</i>

20
00:02:23,046 --> 00:02:26,983
<i>Chuck came ready-made
from the Play-Doh fun factory of life.</i>

21
00:02:28,203 --> 00:02:32,708
<i>In their imaginations, yound Ned and the
girl named Chuck conquered the world.</i>

22
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:54,622
<i>Long after their play date was over,
young Ned remained under Chuck spell.</i>

23
00:02:56,457 --> 00:03:00,792
<i>Until a blood vessel in his mother's
brain burst, killing her instantly.</i>

24
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:22,418
Must have slipped.

25
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:25,008
Clumsy. Did the timer go off?

26
00:03:32,658 --> 00:03:37,098
<i>Young Ned's random gift that was,
came with a caveator too.</i>

27
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:45,593
<i>It was a gift that not only gave...</i>

28
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:48,073
<i>...but took.</i>

29
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:51,431
<i>Young Ned discovered he could
only bring the dead back to life</i>

30
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:53,528
<i>for one minute without consequences.</i>

31
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,589
<i>Any longer and someone else had to die.</i>

32
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,859
<i>In the grand universal scheme of things,</i>

33
00:04:01,984 --> 00:04:05,326
<i>young Ned traded his mother's life
for Chuck's father.</i>

34
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:06,903
<i>Come on big Neddy, go to bed</i>

35
00:04:07,516 --> 00:04:09,671
<i>But there was one more thing
about touching</i>

36
00:04:09,705 --> 00:04:11,794
<i>dead things that young Ned didn't know.</i>

37
00:04:12,036 --> 00:04:15,295
<i>And he learned it
in the most unfortunate way.</i>

38
00:04:31,697 --> 00:04:33,419
<i>First touch : life.</i>

39
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:37,338
<i>Second touch : dead again, forever.</i>

40
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:42,894
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

41
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:46,712
<i>After a brief mourning period,</i>

42
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:50,205
<i>Young Ned's father would
hustle him off to boarding school.</i>

43
00:04:50,322 --> 00:04:51,994
<i>Never to be seen again.</i>

44
00:04:53,046 --> 00:04:55,921
<i>Chuck would be fostered
by aunts Lily and Vivian,</i>

45
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:58,260
<i>A renowned synchronized swimming duo</i>

46
00:04:58,461 --> 00:05:02,689
<i>They shared matching personality
disorders and a love for fine cheese.</i>

47
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:12,157
<i>At their respective parent's funerals</i>

48
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:16,062
<i>Dizzy with grief, curiosity and hormons</i>

49
00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:18,368
<i>Young Ned and the girl named Chuck,</i>

50
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,711
<i>had their first and only kiss.</i>

51
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:28,156
<i>After his mother's death,
Ned avoided social attachments,</i>

52
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:31,724
<i>fearing what he'd do if someone
else he loved died.</i>

53
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:36,077
<i>And he became obsessed with pies.</i>

54
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:40,710
<i>It's 19 years 34 weeks
1 day and 59 minutes later,</i>

55
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:43,618
<i>Hereto for known as now.</i>

56
00:05:44,972 --> 00:05:47,964
<i>Young Ned has become the pie-maker.</i>

57
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,471
<i>And this is where he makes his pies.</i>

58
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,291
<i>The peaches never brown,</i>

59
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:57,614
<i>the dead fruit in his hand becomes ripe</i>

60
00:05:57,672 --> 00:05:59,410
<i>with everlasting flavor</i>

61
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:02,352
<i>as long as he only touches it once.</i>

62
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:06,379
Every day I come in, I pick a pie,

63
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:08,547
I concentrate all my love on that pie,

64
00:06:08,563 --> 00:06:11,353
if I love it, someone else is gonna
love it, and you know what?

65
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,461
By the end of the day,

66
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:15,079
I've sold more of those pies
than any other pie in the bakery.

67
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,139
- Yeah? What pie do you love today?
- Rhubarb.

68
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:21,598
I'll stick with three plum, a la mode.

69
00:06:24,748 --> 00:06:28,165
<i>Emerson Cod was the sole keeper
of the pie-maker's secret</i>

70
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:32,498
<i>And this ishow he came to be the sole
keeper of the pie-maker's secret</i>

71
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,910
<i>A private investigator,
Mr. Cod met the pie-maker</i>

72
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:39,567
<i>when his Pie Hole was
on the verge of financial ruin.</i>

73
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:54,858
<i>Mr. Cod proposed a partnership.</i>

74
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:59,061
<i>Murders are much easier to solve when
you can ask the victim who killed them.</i>

75
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,386
<i>The pie-maker reluctantly agreed.</i>

76
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,753
I asked you not to use the word zombie,
it's disrespectful

77
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:11,335
Gamboling around, squawking for brain,
that's not how they do.

78
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,447
And undead, nobody
wants to be un-anything,

79
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,887
Why begin to stick with the negative?

80
00:07:14,888 --> 00:07:17,706
It's like saying : I don't disagree,
just to say you agree.

81
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:19,494
Are you confortable with living dead?

82
00:07:19,644 --> 00:07:21,148
You're either living or you're dead

83
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:23,142
When you're living your life when
you're dead,

84
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:26,536
that's what you are but when you're dead
and then you're not, you're alive again.

85
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:28,552
Can't we say alive again?

86
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:30,030
Didn't that sound nice?

87
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:31,907
It sounds like you are narcoleptic.

88
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:34,501
I suffer from sudden
uncontrolable attacks of deep sleep.

89
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,576
- What's the other?
- Necrophiliac?

90
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:39,974
Well, all these sounds are
mixed up in my head.

91
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:43,300
Me too. I used to think
masturbation meant chewing your food.

92
00:07:46,135 --> 00:07:47,494
I don't think that anymore.

93
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:50,498
Can you lock the door behind you?

94
00:07:55,988 --> 00:07:58,471
So you want in on
this opportunity or not?

95
00:07:58,891 --> 00:08:00,352
A dog is involved.

96
00:08:01,308 --> 00:08:03,892
- What kind of dog?
- He's gonna be a dead dog.

97
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:05,588
A dead dog named Cantaloupe.

98
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:07,659
They put her down in allegedly
killed her owner.

99
00:08:07,694 --> 00:08:10,077
- When you say allegedly...
- Cantaloupe was framed.

100
00:08:10,253 --> 00:08:12,397
Someone put a part of the victim
in her mouth.

101
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,011
Docile as a kitten, says the family.

102
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,015
Despite of being a Chow, the breed
most likely to turn on its owner.

103
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:21,229
That's racial profiling, look at you.

104
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:23,021
If the dog is innocent,
then it's murder.

105
00:08:23,077 --> 00:08:25,294
And if it's murder,
then there's a reward.

106
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,203
<i>The facts were these :
one Leonard Gaswint</i>

107
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,902
<i>39 years, 42 weeks, 5 days,
3 hours and 26 minutes old,</i>

108
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:35,604
<i>was found mauled to death
in his own office.</i>

109
00:08:35,939 --> 00:08:40,286
<i>His dog Cantaloupe was the sole witness
and only suspect in the murder.</i>

110
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,222
<i>Convinced of her innocence,
the Gaswint family</i>

111
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:46,243
<i>afford a significant reward
to find the real killer.</i>

112
00:08:46,864 --> 00:08:48,475
You're the dog expert?

113
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:50,338
Already had a dog expert.

114
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,754
I'm the other one.

115
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,679
Fine, but my threshold's pretty high,

116
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,282
so you have to takewhat I say
with a grain of salt.

117
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,928
That ain't a grain of salt.

118
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,008
that's what them blokes
they give cows to lick.

119
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:08,117
He can't help how he is.

120
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,694
That don't make any less dramatic.

121
00:09:09,795 --> 00:09:10,953
- For who?
- Me.

122
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:13,168
And I'm sure him, but mainly me.

123
00:09:14,494 --> 00:09:15,551
I'm gonna wait outside.

124
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,078
- Hello.
- Hi.

125
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,505
Sorry to disturb you Mr. Gaswint
or Leonard,

126
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:34,119
- do you prefer--
- Leo!

127
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,229
Your current condition...

128
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:39,806
Do I have something right here?

129
00:09:41,926 --> 00:09:43,083
There's nothing right there.

130
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:44,463
- Damn dog.
- Cantaloupe?

131
00:09:44,673 --> 00:09:47,026
No, Cantaloupe is docile as a kitten.

132
00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:50,158
It's that Rottweiler,
my secretary sicked her dog on me.

133
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:52,684
She's been upset
since last year's Christmas party.

134
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,630
You know, it's a funny story...

135
00:09:58,489 --> 00:09:59,500
Was it the Chow?

136
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:02,398
The secretary... with her Rottweiler.

137
00:10:12,805 --> 00:10:15,533
<i>Her good name cleared
and her execution stayed,</i>

138
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:17,503
<i>Cantaloupe was freed.</i>

139
00:10:18,003 --> 00:10:21,389
<i>And the secretary
and her Rottweiler were hold to justice.</i>

140
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:23,480
<i>An anonymous tip led
to solving the murder</i>

141
00:10:23,628 --> 00:10:26,977
<i>of a Michigan entrepreneur thought
to be mauled to death by a family pet.</i>

142
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:29,794
<i>The truth however is much more sinister.</i>

143
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,853
<i>Olive Snook enjoyed
her time with Digby.</i>

144
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,984
<i>He was a surrogate
for the human connection</i>

145
00:10:35,132 --> 00:10:36,640
<i>she wanted with the pie-maker.</i>

146
00:10:36,963 --> 00:10:38,432
<i>Her desperate attempts to connect</i>

147
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:41,271
<i>to someone
so disconnected terrified him.</i>

148
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:44,154
<i>But that didn't stop her from trying.</i>

149
00:10:44,346 --> 00:10:45,571
How was your convention?

150
00:10:46,054 --> 00:10:47,056
Conventional.

151
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:48,269
How is Digby?

152
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,779
Neurotic. He's a very nutty dog.

153
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:51,242
Do you pet him?

154
00:10:51,255 --> 00:10:53,903
Maybe if you pet him once in a while,
he wouldn't be so neurotic.

155
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,713
I pet him, I'm allergic so I can't
actually touch him but I pet him.

156
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:58,608
With a stick? How do you pet him?

157
00:10:58,793 --> 00:11:02,522
A stick is involved but it's more like
a handle to a... handing device.

158
00:11:02,785 --> 00:11:04,547
A dog needs to be touched.

159
00:11:05,648 --> 00:11:07,951
We all need to be touched.

160
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,326
You touch him. Other people touch him.

161
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:11,538
He's your dog.

162
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:13,056
Do you...

163
00:11:13,777 --> 00:11:14,859
... touch anything?

164
00:11:15,572 --> 00:11:16,916
Of course, I...

165
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,396
I touch lots of things.

166
00:11:19,577 --> 00:11:20,577
With affection.

167
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:24,551
When was the last time
someone touched you with affection?

168
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
I get touched...

169
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:31,427
Can you get Digby's leash now?

170
00:11:38,372 --> 00:11:40,408
You don't mind
that I don't touch you, do you?

171
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,911
<i>And then came the event
that changed everything.</i>

172
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:46,329
<i>... the body of a young woman
allegedly murdered</i>

173
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:48,880
<i>aboard a cruise ship
has been recovered from the sea.</i>

174
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:50,936
<i>The victim's identity
is being withheld...</i>

175
00:11:51,064 --> 00:11:53,104
<i>The pie-maker listened
intently to the news,</i>

176
00:11:53,224 --> 00:11:54,732
<i>unaware that he stopped breathing.</i>

177
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:58,841
<i>He was haunted by the name of this woman
who met her end on the high seas.</i>

178
00:11:59,661 --> 00:12:01,808
Oh, my... here's your leash.

179
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:03,665
<i>But he didn't know why...</i>

180
00:12:04,063 --> 00:12:06,699
<i>Her name is still withheld,
very little is known of the victim</i>

181
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:08,661
<i>who was reportedly traveling alone</i>

182
00:12:08,848 --> 00:12:11,574
<i>when murdered aboard
a passenger ship that was returning</i>

183
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:15,356
<i>from a tropical cruise sailing between
the United States and Tahiti.</i>

184
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:18,985
<i>The ship's captain initially
dismissed the death as an accident,</i>

185
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:22,315
<i>suggesting the victim likely
returned from a late night out...</i>

186
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:28,031
Been watching the news lately?

187
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:31,390
Doesn't seem like much going on in
the world besides a dead girl on a boat.

188
00:12:31,641 --> 00:12:33,038
I'd going on with that dead girl.

189
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:34,162
Is that so?

190
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:36,284
50 000 $ with the dead so...

191
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,656
- You're interested in a conversation?
- Yeah, I could be persuaded.

192
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,074
Well, you better be persuaded quick

193
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:41,855
as the dead girl's about
to go into ground.

194
00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:43,725
They just put her out of the water.

195
00:12:44,153 --> 00:12:45,153
Jewish.

196
00:12:45,253 --> 00:12:48,113
Christians leave them laying around,
Jews got to get them buried.

197
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,964
- Where’re we going?
- Couer d' Couers.

198
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:52,732
- You ever been there?
- I grew up there. Sort of...

199
00:12:53,478 --> 00:12:55,851
This dead girl from Couer d' Couers,
does she have a name?

200
00:12:55,964 --> 00:12:57,161
Charlotte Charles...

201
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,770
Chuck...

202
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:15,507
<i>The pie-maker
never returned to Couer d'Couers</i>

203
00:13:15,673 --> 00:13:17,330
<i>after being sent away to school.</i>

204
00:13:17,641 --> 00:13:19,609
<i>But he thought of Chuck everyday.</i>

205
00:13:20,505 --> 00:13:22,374
- You know this girl?
- I know of her.

206
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,812
Know of her in the biblical sense?

207
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:25,659
I haven't thought of her since I was 10.

208
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:27,336
Think of her a lot when you were 10?

209
00:13:28,288 --> 00:13:30,527
Don't remember anything when I was 10.

210
00:13:31,354 --> 00:13:33,544
<i>The pie-maker remembers everything.</i>

211
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:36,061
<i>The facts were these...</i>

212
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:41,209
<i>Charlotte Charles, 28 years, 24 weeks,
3 days, 11 hours and 51 minutes old</i>

213
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:46,169
<i>was found floating in the ocean moments
after her body was discarded there.</i>

214
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,516
<i>Discarded by whom
seemed to be a question</i>

215
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:55,818
<i>only Charlotte Charles could answer.</i>

216
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,480
<i>The funeral director,
always eager to supplement his income,</i>

217
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:10,302
Gentlemen.

218
00:14:10,336 --> 00:14:13,322
<i>was more than happy to grant
the deceased an audience.</i>

219
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:21,412
I just wanna... I wanna...
Can I do this one alone?

220
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:24,363
On account of... you know...
the whole historical context of...

221
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,224
You have something
personal you need to say?

222
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:27,267
No...

223
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,055
OK, maybe. But I've nothing
to gain but a small amount of closure

224
00:14:31,493 --> 00:14:33,342
What do you got so
open that needs closure?

225
00:14:34,422 --> 00:14:36,754
Just wanna say I'm sorry for something,

226
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:39,592
one of those stupid things kids do,
they don't know they're doing.

227
00:14:39,631 --> 00:14:41,859
Yeah, well,
you ask who killed her first.

228
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:43,320
- OK.
- You only got a minute.

229
00:14:43,452 --> 00:14:44,452
- I know.
- 60 seconds.

230
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:45,872
- I know.
- All right.

231
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:05,860
<i>Only Prince Charming could know</i>

232
00:15:05,982 --> 00:15:08,193
<i>how the pie-maker
felt upon looking at her.</i>

233
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,636
<i>Great thought was taken
as to where to touch her.</i>

234
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:14,902
<i>The lip's too forward</i>

235
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:17,123
<i>The cheek...</i>

236
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:18,816
<i>The cheek.</i>

237
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:26,870
- Chuck, wait!
- Who are you?

238
00:15:26,998 --> 00:15:30,134
You remember the little boy who lived
next door to you when your dad died?

239
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:33,721
Ned? Oh, my God! Hey, how are you?

240
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,902
Good, you look great.
You know what's happening right now?

241
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,387
I had the strangest dream, I was being
strangled to death with a plastic sack.

242
00:15:40,528 --> 00:15:42,496
You were strangled to death
with a plastic sack.

243
00:15:42,547 --> 00:15:46,649
That's probably an odd thing to hear but
I wasn't quite sure how to sugar-code it

244
00:15:48,099 --> 00:15:49,665
You only have a minute... less.

245
00:15:49,803 --> 00:15:51,367
What can I do in less than a minute?

246
00:15:51,445 --> 00:15:54,765
You could tell me who killed you,
so... you know, justice can be served.

247
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:56,933
Well, that's really sweet
but I don't know who killed me.

248
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:57,887
<i>I went to go to get ice</i>

249
00:15:57,888 --> 00:16:00,376
<i>and I dropped my room key
in the icemaker, as I was thinking,</i>

250
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:02,714
<i>... "That was dumb".</i>
<i>- She was thinking, "That was dumb",</i>

251
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:05,665
<i>Chuck was strangled
to death with a plastic sack.</i>

252
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:07,809
And then you touched my cheek.

253
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,537
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- Just a second!

254
00:16:11,112 --> 00:16:12,507
- Is my time up?
- I'm sorry.

255
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,682
Well... thanks for calling me Chuck.

256
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,917
Do you know, nobody's
called me Chuck since...

257
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:20,731
... since you.

258
00:16:21,443 --> 00:16:23,674
And I used to,
when I lived next door to you...

259
00:16:23,795 --> 00:16:25,317
I had a cr... I was in...

260
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:28,342
You were my first kiss.

261
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:30,105
Yeah?

262
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,111
You were my first kiss too.

263
00:16:34,045 --> 00:16:37,800
You wanna be my last kiss?
First and last? Is that weird?

264
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:40,668
That's not weird.

265
00:16:41,306 --> 00:16:42,320
It's magical.

266
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:46,154
<i>Chuck's minute of life was nearly over.</i>

267
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:53,502
<i>The pie-maker's lips went
as far as they would go.</i>

268
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:56,928
<i>He couldn't will them to go any further.</i>

269
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:03,486
<i>And as a consequence...</i>

270
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,531
<i>... the funeral director
would go no further.</i>

271
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,061
Hey, if you don't wanna kiss me,
it's OK. I just thought it may be...

272
00:17:20,134 --> 00:17:21,822
No, I want to, I do, I...

273
00:17:23,672 --> 00:17:26,238
What if you didn't have to... be dead.

274
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,382
Well, that would be preferable.

275
00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:32,627
Nobody can know.

276
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:34,590
Hop in !

277
00:17:35,578 --> 00:17:37,716
I got to think of a way
to get you out of here.

278
00:17:39,043 --> 00:17:41,569
Can you lie really still,
until I get back?

279
00:17:45,987 --> 00:17:47,259
Doesn't know. Didn't know.

280
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:49,541
So somebody just threw
her carcass over boat

281
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,907
- Why're you sweating?
- I'm... It's warm in there. What?

282
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:53,306
- Your eye's twitching.
- My eye?

283
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:55,279
You eye is twitching.

284
00:17:55,806 --> 00:17:57,990
When people aren't being honest,
their eye twitches.

285
00:17:58,103 --> 00:18:00,037
Right there. Like yours did just now.

286
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,962
It's nerves.
Aggravated by a stomach thing.

287
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:04,039
It's like acid reflux but in my eye.

288
00:18:04,592 --> 00:18:06,470
I think I'm gonna stay for the service.

289
00:18:06,748 --> 00:18:07,812
Is that so?

290
00:18:07,972 --> 00:18:11,098
Just feeling nostalgic. Do you remember
how get back to the station?

291
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:14,813
It's down the... I'll catch you
later boss.

292
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:02,537
<i>Lying in the dark, Chuck considered
how she came to be lying in the dark.</i>

293
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,694
<i>She considered the life
that was with aunts Lily and Vivian.</i>

294
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,945
<i>That personality disorders blossomed
into incapacitating social phobia.</i>

295
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,440
<i>Which made it difficult
for them to leave the house.</i>

296
00:19:19,484 --> 00:19:22,516
<i>Which in turn made it difficult
for Chuck to leave them.</i>

297
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:27,020
<i>She served her community
by harvesting honey for the homeless.</i>

298
00:19:27,702 --> 00:19:30,327
<i>She never strayed far from home.</i>

299
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,672
<i>She read about people
she could never be,</i>

300
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:35,096
<i>and adventures she would never have.</i>

301
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:39,033
<i>Life was good enough,
until one day, it wasn't.</i>

302
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:40,693
<i>Chuck wanted more.</i>

303
00:19:40,905 --> 00:19:45,300
<i>But at Boutique Travel Travel Boutique,
she got more than she bargained for.</i>

304
00:19:47,108 --> 00:19:49,366
Hey, I think somebody's truck's on fire.

305
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:51,613
Oh Jesus!

306
00:19:57,074 --> 00:19:58,083
Sorry I'm late.

307
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:02,155
<i>Only Sleeping Beauty could know
how she felt at this moment.</i>

308
00:20:06,802 --> 00:20:08,900
I can't even hug you,
what if you need a hug?

309
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:10,335
A hug can turn your day around.

310
00:20:10,336 --> 00:20:11,467
I'm not a fan of hug.

311
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,884
Then you haven't been hug properly,

312
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:15,508
it's like an emotional Heimlich
someone puts their arms around you

313
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:17,253
and they give you a squeeze and...

314
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,617
All your fear and anxiety
come shooting out of your mouth

315
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,334
and a big white light and
you can breath again.

316
00:20:21,347 --> 00:20:22,726
That's fine for someone else to do

317
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:24,906
if I'm chocking on something other
than emotion but

318
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:26,047
you can't touch me.

319
00:20:26,394 --> 00:20:27,785
So a kiss is out of the question?

320
00:20:31,276 --> 00:20:32,709
I've lost my train of thought.

321
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:38,461
How long have you been thinking
about this?

322
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:40,541
Like thinking thinking?
That was unpremeditaded,

323
00:20:40,618 --> 00:20:43,822
I wasn't lining in wait,
more like I was musing on the idea

324
00:20:43,907 --> 00:20:44,947
not you know,

325
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:46,908
dwelling,
there was time I did dwell on you

326
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:48,078
about you, a little.

327
00:20:48,156 --> 00:20:51,574
But I was't seriously considering
till the exact moment I did it

328
00:20:51,794 --> 00:20:53,354
or didn't do it...

329
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,282
I was wondering if you'd come back.

330
00:20:56,361 --> 00:20:58,217
I guess you came back
when I needed you most.

331
00:20:58,243 --> 00:21:00,756
Well that would have been
before I was killed,

332
00:21:01,557 --> 00:21:02,557
but this worked out.

333
00:21:02,805 --> 00:21:04,493
You understand you can't go back, right?

334
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,890
You can't see your aunts.

335
00:21:05,944 --> 00:21:07,890
they'll go off their rockers
without me besides

336
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,859
they're shut-in,
it's not like they talk to anybody.

337
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:11,369
People are used to this sort of thing.

338
00:21:11,382 --> 00:21:13,514
Issues of morality,
how come she's not dead anymore.

339
00:21:13,515 --> 00:21:14,606
It'd be a disaster.

340
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,365
I suppose dying is as good an excuse
as any to start living.

341
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:27,647
This is Digby.

342
00:21:28,242 --> 00:21:29,632
Wasn't your old dog named Digby?

343
00:21:29,987 --> 00:21:30,987
This is him.

344
00:21:32,469 --> 00:21:33,469
Did you...?

345
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:34,994
And now is here?

346
00:21:35,384 --> 00:21:36,384
Yeah.

347
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,937
You seem to do that a lot.

348
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:39,107
Why do you do that a lot?

349
00:21:39,178 --> 00:21:40,199
It's just the two of you.

350
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,213
I hate to be a bad host
but I'm sort of exhausted

351
00:21:44,214 --> 00:21:46,984
- from chasing your coffin.
- Oh yeah, of course.

352
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:50,034
I'm gonna sleep here,
you take the bed, I insist.

353
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,998
My eyes are rolling back into my head.

354
00:21:56,437 --> 00:21:57,785
I'm lying down now.

355
00:22:07,389 --> 00:22:08,864
I'd kiss you but it would kill me.

365

Ned?

366
00:22:42,977 --> 00:22:45,360
Would I be alive right now
if I knew who killed me?

367
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,105
Of course, don't be silly,

368
00:22:47,106 --> 00:22:49,000
that's something in the news
about the reward.

369
00:22:49,013 --> 00:22:51,743
You said you wanted to know who killed
me so that justice can be served.

370
00:22:51,755 --> 00:22:53,301
And I don't think
justice was on the menu,

371
00:22:53,314 --> 00:22:55,085
maybe is a side dish,
but not as an entree.

372
00:22:55,098 --> 00:22:56,353
It's most definitely an entree.

373

It was a special of the day.
Can we drop the metaphore?

When were you gonna tell me?

376
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:05,492
In the morning, or when it came up
which ever didn't come first.

377
00:23:05,513 --> 00:23:07,314
$50,000, that makes a lot of pie.

378
00:23:07,315 --> 00:23:09,073
25,000, I have a business partner.

379
00:23:09,442 --> 00:23:12,208
- What? It's a business?
- Not in the traditionnal sense.

380
00:23:12,605 --> 00:23:14,042
You touch murdered victims,

381
00:23:14,043 --> 00:23:15,936
you ask who killed them,
you touch them again,

382
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:17,873
they go back to being dead,
and then you...

383
00:23:18,057 --> 00:23:19,057
collect the reward ?

384
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,660
That's it in a nutshell.

385
00:23:20,745 --> 00:23:22,022
So you're after my reward?

386
00:23:22,164 --> 00:23:23,958
I'm not mad at you,
I just want to know...

387
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:25,746
I'll be mad at you
if you lie to me though.

388
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:26,766
I don't want your reward.

389
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:29,401
I'll be so mad if you're lying,
you have me scratching the drapes.

390
00:23:29,414 --> 00:23:30,579
I'm not lying.

391
00:23:30,795 --> 00:23:32,769
Please don't attack
the window treatments.

392

Okay, go back to sleep.

I'm a friend of Ned's.

394

Does he touch you?

395
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:42,150
-  So how was the service?
- You know, I just paid my respects.

396
00:24:42,675 --> 00:24:43,909
You are not going to get paid.

397
00:24:44,331 --> 00:24:46,452
Might see a dead woman
speaking to you in confidence

398
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:49,036
as an opportunity to make
a whole lot of money by you lonesome.

399
00:24:49,044 --> 00:24:52,675
- Regardless our prior arrangements.
- There's no opportunity here.

400
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,614
Are you the business partner?.

401
00:24:54,812 --> 00:24:56,670
- Yes, M'am.
- Found her upstairs.

402
00:24:56,897 --> 00:24:58,778
Doesn't she look a lot
like that dead girl?

403
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,697
She looks exactly like that dead girl.

404
00:25:00,724 --> 00:25:02,897
You should take that as a compliment,
she was pretty.

405
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,125
Pie time.

406
00:25:05,011 --> 00:25:06,011
Pie time?

407
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:11,278
I've been ruminating and by ruminating;
I mean pondering not chewing cud.

408
00:25:11,295 --> 00:25:13,435
How about we solve my murder
and collect the reward?

409
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,642
wouldn't that be poetic?

410
00:25:15,095 --> 00:25:16,180
Certainly an anecdote.

411
00:25:16,193 --> 00:25:17,600
She's supposed to be in the ground.

412
00:25:17,613 --> 00:25:19,002
I thought you didn't want the reward.

413
00:25:19,015 --> 00:25:22,453
No, I wanted you not to want
the reward. $50,000 is a lot of money.

414
00:25:23,235 --> 00:25:24,235
Three way split.

415
00:25:24,285 --> 00:25:25,334
30 - 30 - 40 ?

416
00:25:25,987 --> 00:25:27,824
It's only fair I get more;
I did die for it.

417
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,485
I'm not a detective, I make pies.

418
00:25:29,498 --> 00:25:31,799
You can't just touch somebody's life
and be done with it.

419
00:25:31,812 --> 00:25:33,132
Yes I can, that's how I roll.

420
00:25:33,277 --> 00:25:34,582
I could do 30 - 30 - 40.

421
00:25:34,682 --> 00:25:36,299
She's supposed to be dead.

422
00:25:36,653 --> 00:25:37,887
You're supposed to be dead.

423
00:25:38,526 --> 00:25:40,256
- This is pushing your luck.
- Yeah, well,

424
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,100
luck pushed me first.

425
00:25:48,137 --> 00:25:51,470
It's just so shockingly stupid,
I have a hard time believing you did it.

426
00:25:51,803 --> 00:25:53,304
You just agreed to be her partner.

427
00:25:53,305 --> 00:25:55,214
I did the profit from your stupidity.

428
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:56,495
Are you in love with her?

429
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:58,035
Cause if it's that level of stupid...

430
00:25:58,036 --> 00:26:00,220
I admit to be confused,
it's a very confusing time

431
00:26:00,221 --> 00:26:03,241
and childhood issues,
digging in the dirt, it's all coming up.

432
00:26:03,242 --> 00:26:05,490
You know what?
We all have childhood issues, okay?

433
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:07,731
Believe me,
I got the full subscription, okay?

434
00:26:07,944 --> 00:26:10,753
- Horror stories.
- I kinda kill her dad when I was 10.

435
00:26:11,334 --> 00:26:12,611
Maybe not horror stories.

436
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:14,567
She doesn't know.

437
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:17,609
But I wanted to make it better
or different in what it was because

438
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,184
what it was was her dead and
I didn't that to be my fault too.

439
00:26:20,304 --> 00:26:21,652
But who died instead?

440
00:26:23,943 --> 00:26:25,801
It's a random proximity thing.

441
00:26:25,802 --> 00:26:27,964
- Bitch! I was in proximity.
- I wasn't thinking.

442
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:30,971
I wonder what happened to him.

443
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:33,155
He was a very very bad man.

444
00:26:33,156 --> 00:26:36,120
He stole stuff off dead people
and sold it on the internet.

445
00:26:36,397 --> 00:26:38,164
- It's all on the obituary.
- That's nice.

446
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:40,397
The fact
that he was a very very bad man

447
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,096
makes you feel better
about what you did?

448
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:43,524
Yes, immensely.

449
00:26:43,851 --> 00:26:45,496
I would've felt horrible if it was...

450
00:26:46,219 --> 00:26:47,255
you for example.

451
00:26:47,948 --> 00:26:48,948
I'm not proud.

452
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,718
You know what? I'm glad you did it.

453
00:26:50,751 --> 00:26:52,880
Makes the worst thing I ever did
seem insignificant.

454
00:26:52,913 --> 00:26:54,742
Listen to you, all judgy judge.

455
00:26:54,856 --> 00:26:56,303
Judgy judge?
Look.

456
00:26:57,125 --> 00:27:00,684
You don't know anything about this girl
except she got herself killed.

457
00:27:03,505 --> 00:27:04,994
I'm not who you think I am.

458
00:27:05,746 --> 00:27:06,795
Who does he think you are?

459
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:09,394
The small town girl
who never saw the world,

460
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:11,209
only to have her first time out
be her last.

461
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:12,852
Well, that is who I am but

462
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:15,757
I was hoisted by my own petard.

463
00:27:15,783 --> 00:27:16,790
What's the petard?

464
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,781
In my case,
the petard is that Tahitian getaway

465
00:27:18,782 --> 00:27:19,844
was a devil's bargain.

466
00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:21,759
- Who's the devil?
- Deedee Dafield.

467
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:23,985
Manager Boutique Travel Travel Boutique.

468
00:27:23,986 --> 00:27:26,212
She offered me a high seas adventure
at no cost.

469
00:27:26,467 --> 00:27:28,056
What I had to do was pick up a package.

470
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:29,942
- Are you a drug mule?
- No.

471
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:32,751
I'm a monkey mule.

472
00:27:33,722 --> 00:27:36,120
<i>And these are the
monkeys on the question.

473
00:27:36,553 --> 00:27:38,184
You died for a pair of plaster monkeys.

474
00:27:38,364 --> 00:27:41,292
Deedee said they weren't worth much,
their only value was sentimental.

475
00:27:41,318 --> 00:27:43,130
Those must have been
some emotional monkeys.

476
00:27:43,181 --> 00:27:44,787
You should ask Deedee about all of this,

477
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,495
I'm very curious as what she has to say.

478
00:27:47,229 --> 00:27:50,492
<i>Boutique Travel Travel Boutique
manager Deedee Dafield</i>

479
00:27:50,493 --> 00:27:53,254
<i>hoped the $50,000 reward
would catch her killer</i>

480
00:27:53,306 --> 00:27:54,975
<i>before her killer caught her.</i>

481
00:27:57,555 --> 00:28:01,264
<i>The reward failed short
of achieving its desired goal.</i>

482
00:28:03,575 --> 00:28:05,150
I guess I can't be too mad at her.

483
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:07,604
Is that how they found me?
It's humiliating.

484
00:28:07,788 --> 00:28:09,164
How long she's been here?

485
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:10,900
Touch the poor bitch and ask her.

486
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:17,502
I'm sort of embarrassed to do it
in front of you.

487
00:28:30,129 --> 00:28:31,760
Hey, Charlotte.

488
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:33,249
Hey, Deedee.

489
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:36,512
How'd I know you'd be the first person
I'd see when I got to...

490
00:28:37,128 --> 00:28:38,128
Is this...

491
00:28:38,504 --> 00:28:39,504
Which one is this?

492
00:28:39,533 --> 00:28:41,173
This is neither.
Well, maybe it's both,

493
00:28:41,174 --> 00:28:42,398
but listen, this is the deal.

494
00:28:42,838 --> 00:28:44,852
You get to talk for like a minute,

495
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,291
we're gonna catch up
and then you're not talking anymore.

496
00:28:47,345 --> 00:28:48,512
Does everyone get to do this?

497
00:28:48,513 --> 00:28:50,214
Cause, girl, we got to break it down.

498
00:28:50,215 --> 00:28:51,675
Did you know I was gonna get killed?

499
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:53,739
I thought there might
be the possibility,

500
00:28:53,763 --> 00:28:56,784
yes, I'm really sorry about that,
I probably should've said something.

501
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,274
But to be honest, and...

502
00:28:58,275 --> 00:29:00,118
really why not at this point?

503
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,316
If it was safe,
I would've done it myself.

504
00:29:02,401 --> 00:29:03,848
God, this is fantastic.

505
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:05,124
Being honest is fun.

506
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,259
Ask her who killed her and you
and what's with the monkeys.

507
00:29:08,386 --> 00:29:09,396
Who are those peaople?

508
00:29:09,436 --> 00:29:11,283
That's Emerson,
I don't really know him,

509
00:29:11,603 --> 00:29:12,603
and this is Ned.

510
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:14,201
He was my first kiss.

511
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,491
You're adorable.

512
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:18,967
Look at...

513
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:23,194
You couldn't have...

514
00:29:23,314 --> 00:29:24,938
Scooted back a little.

515
00:29:24,939 --> 00:29:27,477
I didn't know she was gonna
touch my cheek, who does that?

516
00:29:27,478 --> 00:29:29,229
Actually, she does that a lot.

517
00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:31,434
All right, but why would
whoever killed you kill her

518
00:29:31,447 --> 00:29:32,732
when he already got his monkeys?

519
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:35,602
I dropped my key in the icemaker,
he couldn't get into my room.

520
00:29:37,816 --> 00:29:39,319
For christ's sake.

521
00:29:39,716 --> 00:29:41,007
This is a nightmare.

522
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:43,331
He doesn't have the monkeys.

523
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:46,219
When you get murdered on a boat,
where do they send your things?

524
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:47,539
Your next of kin.

525
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,750
You stay here.

526
00:30:13,928 --> 00:30:15,299
I just want to look in the window.

527
00:30:15,312 --> 00:30:17,372
You can't. You could have your pie
but you can't eat it,

528
00:30:17,391 --> 00:30:19,314
that's the way it works.
- You're making me hungry.

529
00:30:19,316 --> 00:30:21,128
I was supposed to keep them
sane and I left.

530
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:22,893
I'd just die if anything
happened to them,

531
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:25,259
I mean I'd die... again.

532
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,030
We'll make sure your aunts are safe
and then we'll call the police.

533
00:30:28,377 --> 00:30:30,359
I wish I could give you
an emotional Heimlich

534
00:30:30,387 --> 00:30:33,359
'cause you could cough up that
all your fear and anxiety but I can't.

535
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,410
Give her a hug.

536
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,480
That was from me.

537
00:30:55,638 --> 00:30:58,185
<i>Aunt Vivian and Aunt Lily were
all Chuck had</i>

538
00:30:58,214 --> 00:31:00,790
<i>and before Chuck
all they had was each other.</i>

539
00:31:03,054 --> 00:31:06,593
<i>While still in their teens they made
a name for themselves as the</i>

540
00:31:06,763 --> 00:31:08,886
<i>"Darling Mermaid Darlings".</i>

541
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:20,350
<i>Many, many, many years later</i>

542
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:24,880
<i>still holding on to their fading
glory as underwater artists</i>

543
00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:27,512
<i>their lifes were changed forever,</i>

544
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:31,617
<i>when Lily, while cleaning the litterbox,
got dirty cat sand in her eye.</i>

545
00:31:31,815 --> 00:31:34,422
<i>Not only did she lose her eye</i>

546
00:31:34,533 --> 00:31:38,014
<i>but the "Darling Mermaid Darlings"
lost their careers.</i>

547
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,336
<i>They retreated behind a fence</i>

548
00:31:40,449 --> 00:31:43,818
<i>and made sure the world
stayed on the other side.</i>

549
00:31:44,978 --> 00:31:46,014
Hello?

550
00:31:46,054 --> 00:31:47,781
Hi, my name is Ned.

551
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:49,932
I lived next door 20 years ago.

552
00:31:50,187 --> 00:31:52,452
I am... was a friend of Chuck's.

553
00:31:53,301 --> 00:31:54,716
Charlotte's, rather.

554
00:31:56,556 --> 00:31:58,056
Please, come in.

555
00:31:58,849 --> 00:31:59,849
Please.

556
00:32:08,332 --> 00:32:11,927
Charlotte was a firecracker, always
trying to get us out of the house,

557
00:32:11,956 --> 00:32:14,475
threatening to bake antidepressants
into our food.

558
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:16,955
It got to the point I was scared
to eat anything she cooked.

559
00:32:16,989 --> 00:32:19,514
She was a good cook and a nice girl.

560
00:32:20,137 --> 00:32:21,241
Do you like girls?

561
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
Yes, M'am.

562
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,609
Didn't want to assume...

563
00:32:25,006 --> 00:32:26,959
Charlotte was a nice girl.

564
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,345
With the exception of puberty...

565
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:31,151
Which was unfortunately when Lily
was going through a change of life.

566
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:34,630
Impolite to discuss a person's menopause
in mixed company.

567
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:36,470
It nearly killed me

568
00:32:38,508 --> 00:32:40,065
Horrible, the way Charlotte died.

569
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,877
On a cruise...

570
00:32:42,273 --> 00:32:45,103
Lasts days spent surrounded
by middle-aged overweight women

571
00:32:45,104 --> 00:32:47,539
who wear sweatshirts with things
sewed to them.

572
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,236
Usually kittens made a felt too.

573
00:32:49,237 --> 00:32:51,134
Food is perfectly atrocious.

574
00:32:51,162 --> 00:32:53,455
Unless she enjoyed
vomiting and diarrhea,

575
00:32:53,483 --> 00:32:55,833
I can't imagine
she had a good last meal.

576
00:32:55,889 --> 00:32:57,503
Good last meal van go a long way.

577
00:32:57,701 --> 00:32:59,286
Our penal systems makes a point of it.

578
00:32:59,343 --> 00:33:01,999
It's nice she had a little glimpse
of the world before she died.

579
00:33:02,117 --> 00:33:03,872
Nah, the world isn't that great.

580
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:06,194
Well, at least she had the good sense
not to fly.

581
00:33:06,307 --> 00:33:08,628
Airplanes fall out of
the sky every day.

582
00:33:14,403 --> 00:33:18,309
Cheese. I would recommend
the pure goat with blue ash...

583
00:33:18,338 --> 00:33:20,008
it has a grassy flavor.

584
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,461
It does, I have a grassy flavor.

585
00:33:23,546 --> 00:33:25,386
It's delicious with Charlotte's honey.

586
00:33:25,443 --> 00:33:27,962
You haven't lived
until you've tasted her honey.

587
00:33:28,585 --> 00:33:30,085
The homeless love it.

588
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:34,699
Not to change the subjects but,

589
00:33:34,926 --> 00:33:36,879
has the cruiseline returned
her belongings?

590
00:33:37,247 --> 00:33:39,795
Specifically a stainless
steel briefcase.

591
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:46,957
<i>Chuck couldn't remember why she was
so desperate to leave this life behind.</i>

592
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:50,184
<i>She missed her aunts,
she missed her bees.</i>

593
00:33:51,288 --> 00:33:53,269
<i>She missed everything she was.</i>

594
00:34:04,536 --> 00:34:05,583
Hello?

595
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:18,916
<i>Smuggling monkeys put
an end to her life.</i>

596
00:34:19,086 --> 00:34:22,568
<i>Chuck didn't want to be remembered
as the lonely tourist.</i>

597
00:34:23,304 --> 00:34:26,022
<i>She wanted to be remembered
as something sweeter.</i>

598
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:08,342
<i>Unaware of Lily's fate upstairs,</i>

599
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:11,116
<i>the pie-maker did his best
to comfort Vivian.</i>

600
00:35:11,371 --> 00:35:13,296
Charlotte always wanted to get away.

601
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:16,042
She got away further
than any of us thought.

602
00:35:17,146 --> 00:35:21,137
<i>In a rare moment of sensitivity,
he reached out and touched her.</i>

603
00:35:30,026 --> 00:35:32,970
<i>Not realizing she didn't like
being touched.</i>

604
00:35:35,857 --> 00:35:38,150
I go see if she needs
any help bringing it down.

605
00:35:59,211 --> 00:36:00,457
Didn't I kill you?

606
00:36:01,532 --> 00:36:04,108
I can hold my breath for a long time.

607
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:15,120
<i>The jig appeared to be up.</i>

608
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:17,866
<i>Aunt Lily was looking
directly at her niece.</i>

609
00:36:17,923 --> 00:36:20,357
<i>Her niece who wasn't supposed
to be alive.</i>

610
00:36:20,923 --> 00:36:22,509
<i>And if she possessed
two good eyes...</i>

611
00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:25,481
She would have seen her.

612
00:36:42,664 --> 00:36:45,551
<i>A rush of warmth
washed over the pie-maker.</i>

613
00:36:47,731 --> 00:36:50,675
<i>He would later describe
this feeling as "delight".</i>

614
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:55,091
<i>The girl he rescued from death
had returned the favor.</i>

615
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:05,961
<i>Former "Darling Mermaid Darlings"
Vivian and Lily Charles</i>

616

<i>defeated a deadly home invader
who may have some connection</i>

617
00:37:09,641 --> 00:37:11,566
<i>to the smuggling-related murder
of their niece</i>

618
00:37:11,623 --> 00:37:13,463
<i>lonely tourist
Charlotte Charles.</i>

619
00:37:13,661 --> 00:37:15,897
<i>When asked about a
"Darling Mermaid Darlings" reunion,</i>

620
00:37:15,954 --> 00:37:18,445
<i>the sisters mentioned
a benefit performance to support</i>

621
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,596
<i>"Honey for the Homeless"
was in the works.</i>

622
00:37:30,929 --> 00:37:32,684
Was this really an act of kindness?

623
00:37:32,825 --> 00:37:33,873
Me, here...

624
00:37:35,271 --> 00:37:37,043
Were you really trying
to do something good

625
00:37:37,072 --> 00:37:38,874
for no other reason than to help me?

626
00:37:39,818 --> 00:37:41,120
I was being selfish.

627
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,913
I'd love to tell myself
I was being unselfish

628
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:45,819
but I know deep down in
my premier sweet spot

629
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:47,970
I was being unselfish
for selfish reasons.

630
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,405
I just thought, my world would be
a better place if you were in it.

631
00:37:57,007 --> 00:37:58,858
Is there anything else I should know?

632
00:38:01,303 --> 00:38:03,030
<i>The pie-maker wanted to tell Chuck</i>

633
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,172
<i>about that fateful afternoon
when he inadvertently</i>

634
00:38:06,222 --> 00:38:09,201
<i>killed her father, but instead he said:</i>

635
00:38:11,098 --> 00:38:12,098
No.

636
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:20,265
Well I figure since they cost me my
life, I should get to keep at least one.

637
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:23,440
And seeing that I wouldn't be alive
if it wasn't for you...

638
00:38:23,836 --> 00:38:25,492
I want you to have the other one.

639
00:38:28,847 --> 00:38:30,945
It's like those
little half-heart pendants...

640
00:38:31,026 --> 00:38:32,076
except with monkeys.

641
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:38,983
Thank you for bringing me back to life.

642
00:38:39,094 --> 00:38:40,094
You're welcome.

643
00:38:54,154 --> 00:38:56,219
Oh, these are heavy...

644
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:09,978
<i>The monkeys value was significantly
more than sentimental...</i>

645
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:11,705
<i>They were golden.</i>

646
00:39:12,979 --> 00:39:15,894
<i>The man who killed Chuck
was killed by Aunt Lily.</i>

647
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:19,546
<i>After collecting the $50,000 reward,</i>

648
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:22,490
<i>Vivian and Lily had
a renewed interest in the world</i>

649
00:39:22,518 --> 00:39:23,962
<i>on the other side of their fence.</i>

650
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,000
<i>They retreated
from their retreat...</i>

651
00:39:27,642 --> 00:39:29,454
<i>and took the plunge.</i>

652
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,275
<i>Emerson Cod was plunged
into something else altogether...</i>

653
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:34,691
<i>A three-way split.</i>

654
00:39:34,848 --> 00:39:37,817
You know this whole thing is sorta like
reincarnation but more immediate.

655
00:39:37,899 --> 00:39:38,954
Sorta.

656
00:39:38,994 --> 00:39:40,352
Do you believe in reincarnation?

657
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:43,013
Hell no.
The planet's falling appart.

658
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,051
Right now, it's the children's problem.

659
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:47,486
We reincarnate, it's our problem.

660
00:39:47,543 --> 00:39:49,864
- Afternoon.
- You're the toxicologist?

661
00:39:50,572 --> 00:39:51,572
Yes.

662
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,591
Aren't you the dog expert?

663
00:39:56,658 --> 00:39:57,658
No.

664
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:04,046
The facts were these:

665
00:40:04,103 --> 00:40:08,434
<i>One Matthew Miltonburger, 37 years,
6 hours and 45 minutes old,</i>

666
00:40:08,547 --> 00:40:11,491
<i>was found stabbed to death
in a public restroom.</i>

667
00:40:14,888 --> 00:40:18,540
<i>Before Mr. Miltonburger could get
into the specifics of his demise...</i>

668
00:40:21,257 --> 00:40:23,522
<i>Chuck thought it would be nice to ask:</i>
- Hi

669
00:40:23,578 --> 00:40:26,239
Do you have any last words
or thoughts or requests?

670
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:32,354
- What?
- Just something I never thought to ask.

671
00:40:34,987 --> 00:40:39,289
<i>As he stared at her, he reached
around his back and held his own hand,</i>

672
00:40:40,478 --> 00:40:42,573
<i>pretending he was holding hers.</i>

673
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:47,640
<i>And at that very moment,
she was pretending to be holding his.</i>
