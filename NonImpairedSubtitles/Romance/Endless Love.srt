00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,838
DAVID: <i>There was a girl.</i>

2
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,692
<i>A beautiful girl
surrounded by people.</i>

3
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,427
<i>Yet utterly alone.</i>

4
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:55,156
<i>Her brother, Chris,
died sophomore year.</i>

5
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:58,951
<i>She spent all of her time
secluded with her family,</i>

6
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:02,663
<i>or in the comfort of books.</i>

7
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,816
<i>I watched her for
all of high school,</i>

8
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,069
<i>waiting for that perfect
moment to talk to her,</i>

9
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,237
<i>but that moment never came.</i>

10
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,923
(INAUDIBLE)

11
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,260
<i>I watched as people
gradually forgot about her.</i>

12
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,598
<i>And she seemed content
to disappear.</i>

13
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,267
<i>But not to me.</i>

14
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,395
<i>And although she didn't know it,</i>

15
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,482
<i>I saw the possibility of us.</i>

16
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,777
Jade Butterfield. Mmm.

17
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:36,012
Four years, and you
never talked to her.

18
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,889
Well, in my defense, no one did.

19
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,392
There is a reason for that.
She's an ice queen.

20
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:42,286
Girl can't be real.

21
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,271
You don't think she's real?

22
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,356
"You don't think..."

23
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:50,151
Girl looks like that, has that much
dough, can't be real, all right?

24
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,004
I know these things.

25
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,160
(CHUCKLES)

26
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,537
Ah, it's stupid, I know.

27
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:01,889
No, it's not.

28
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,209
Come on. Dad wants a photo
of the happy family.

29
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,711
Oh, whose family are we
taking a picture of?

30
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:09,063
Come on.

31
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,466
Jade, come take a picture.

32
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,385
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

33
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:16,529
Okay.

34
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,390
Thank you so much.
Will you take two?

35
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,034
Just to be safe.

36
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,578
Okay.

37
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,565
(SHUTTER CLICKING)

38
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,483
- There.
- Thank you.

39
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,069
- Congrats, honey.
- Thanks.

40
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,237
GIRL 1: That one's going online.

41
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:35,339
GIRL 2: Yeah.

42
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:39,743
I barely know those girls.

43
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,411
I didn't expect to
be in the picture.

44
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:42,787
Take a seat. Come on.

45
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:46,725
Mom and Dad's happy
family photo can wait.

46
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:48,018
(CHUCKLES)

47
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:51,897
Promise me you won't do in
college what you did here.

48
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,844
Chris was an amazing brother,
and we all miss him,

49
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,697
but you can't stop living.

50
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,993
He'd want us to live
more, not less.

51
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,771
How's anyone ever gonna know how
ridiculous and funny you are

52
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:09,647
if all you ever do is hang
out with Mom and Dad?

53
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,608
- I don't just hang out with Mom and Dad.
- Oh, really?

54
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:12,817
How many kids signed this?

55
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,527
And, uh, you can't
include teachers.

56
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,629
Don't.

57
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,075
Thanks, Dad.

58
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:21,719
You're welcome, son.
I'm proud of you.

59
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,788
Thank you. It means a lot.

60
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,706
Maybe you should buy
a blowtorch, huh?

61
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,517
- To melt the ice off your girl.
- Mace...

62
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:30,460
- Your son's got a crush.
- No, I don't.

63
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,212
- Does he?
- No, I don't.

64
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:33,296
- Is she here?
- Yeah.

65
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,339
Which one is it?

66
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,466
- Jade Butterfield. Mmm-hmm.
- HARRY: That blonde over there?

67
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,551
- Don't you dare. No.
- Hey, Jade!

68
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,803
Hey, Jade!

69
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:40,929
MACE: Jade!

70
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,971
Jade, I want you to meet my son!

71
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,074
- Come on! Come on!
- The greatest kid here!

72
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:46,601
DAVID: Hey, you guys. Come on, man!

73
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:49,872
Whoo-hoo. My son, the
high school graduate!

74
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,082
(GROANING)

75
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:59,030
Oh, wow. Mr. Schwartz,
thank you. This is too much.

76
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:02,593
Mrs. Schwartz. You guys take
care now, all right? Okay.

77
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,221
Ah. (CHUCKLES)

78

Balling!

79
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,499
Dude, you going to
Jenny's Saturday night?

80
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,769
Really? Again?

81
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,462
- Come on.
- Don't do this.

82
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,007
Do you have any idea how your
constant break-ups affect my life?

83
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,091
I'm so sorry.

84
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,801
The energy, man, it gets all
awkward and shit, all right?

85
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,594
Just get back together
with her so I can

86
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,304
go back to the life
I'm accustomed to.

87
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,658
Can you act like a
respectable human being?

88
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,018
You're the first
face the guests see.

89
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,912
And yet they keep coming back.
(CHUCKLES)

90
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,355
Welcome to the Inn.
How are you doing?

91
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:35,775
HUGH: Can you just, uh,
give me a nice spot?

92
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,587
MACE: Absolutely.
Will do, sir. Take care.

We go to school... I mean,

97
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,788
we went to school together.

98
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,057
David, right?

99
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,393
Yeah.

100
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,521
HUGH: Hey, Jade.

101
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,317
I should go.

102
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,611
Okay.

103
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:12,788
Would you sign this?

104
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:16,375
Sure.

HUGH: My wife will have a mixed salad
to start and your pasta special.

110
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:53,829
My daughter's gonna have the
steak, medium, and soup to start.

111
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,289
Good?

112
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,583
- Yeah.
- WAITER: And for you?

113
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:00,336
I think I can handle this myself.

114
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:03,697
I'm gonna go for the burger and
fries. Medium rare, please.

115
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,758
And a Crown and Coke. Better
make it a double, actually.

116
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,867
You're here from ASU
for two short months.

117
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,471
Let's just try and
keep it pleasant.

118
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,598
That's why I got the double, Dad.

Um...

120
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:23,383
We've been going back and forth over
what to get you for graduation.

122
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:27,470
We know we haven't done very
well with the holidays and so on

123
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,472
and that's not been
fair to you or Keith.

124
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,974
I don't need anything.

125
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:33,810
We could go shopping. We could
get a new wardrobe for Brown.

126
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:34,894
Yeah, you should
think of something,

127
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,146
or else you'll end up
with a photo of this guy.

(ALL CHUCKLE)

129
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,280
There is one thing.

130
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:46,924
What? Anything.

131
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,429
- A party.
- A party? Wow.

Out of all the things
you could ask for?

133
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:59,836
Well, I was looking at all
the kids at school today

134
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,797
and high school's where you're supposed
to make friends you'll keep forever.

135
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,674
I don't know any of them.

They don't know me.

137
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,721
A party. I think that
that is a great idea.

00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:11,031
Well...

139
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:13,117

Is it that hard to believe?

Uh, no. I've just
never seen you out.

can fix an old car.

Modern-day romantic. I see.

- Oh, no, Hugh.

Speaking as someone who's been
married for over two decades.

614
00:32:02,006 --> 00:32:06,986
I mean, love is wonderful,
but it's not all you need.

616
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:10,614
You also need things
like life insurance

617
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:14,326
and PPOs and unromantic
things, like mortgages.

618
00:32:14,852 --> 00:32:16,162
I get that.

619
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:18,688
I mean, I'm sure
I'll have all those things one day,

620
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:21,149
but I do think
that love comes first, you know?

00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,411

what's more important than that?

when it's there,

627
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:39,643
and I know what it's
like when it's not.

628
00:32:41,003 --> 00:32:42,605
So you've been in love before.

629
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,732
No, no. (CHUCKLES)

630
00:32:45,383 --> 00:32:46,716
But my parents were.

631
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:49,719
They met when they were in high
school, and it made sense.

632
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,656
That's what I wanna find.
True love.

633
00:32:52,723 --> 00:32:55,993
The kind that you fight for,
that you always put first.

634
00:32:56,435 --> 00:33:00,664
That makes you wanna
be good and do better.

635
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,376
And not just with any girl.

636
00:33:04,777 --> 00:33:06,212
But "the" girl.

637
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,673
And when I find that,

638
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:11,967
that's all I need.

639
00:33:13,536 --> 00:33:14,845

640
00:33:16,956 --> 00:33:18,557
Sounds great.

641
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,376
Maybe I should have said
I was going to college.

642
00:33:21,377 --> 00:33:22,978
- (CHUCKLING)
- Yeah.

643
00:33:23,129 --> 00:33:25,714
I hope that you find that, David.

644
00:33:25,715 --> 00:33:28,776
Thank you.
I mean, you and Hugh did.

going to the lake house.

the boat out for a little spin.

I'm gonna wait for Jade.

mosquitoes, but I just love it.

And you know, no matter what
was happening in our lives,

988
00:56:02,113 --> 00:56:06,008

nothing would seem as bad.

you ask me about last night.

00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:18,670
Last night?

993

I'd be very careful, David.

998

That's a serious accusation
you're about to make.

tell Jade, I'm not.

you brought me out here.

If she found out,
it would kill her.

1003

There's nothing to tell.

win, but for now...

For now, you're proposing.

1133

For now, I'm proposing.
And hopefully eloping.

1134
01:03:31,228 --> 01:03:34,748
You know, man,
I'm really glad you came.

1135
01:03:36,108 --> 01:03:37,209
Thank you.

And I'm glad you're with my sister.

- Shh.
- What's happened?

1167
01:05:01,027 --> 01:05:03,903
There was a reason I didn't
invite David on this trip.

1168
01:05:03,904 --> 01:05:07,716
I know, but it's because of David
that I'm not in jail, too.

01:05:07,783 --> 01:05:09,593
No, it's because of David
that you've changed.

01:05:09,618 --> 01:05:10,827
And not for the better.

1171

Hugh, are you not
gonna go and get him?

1172
01:05:13,497 --> 01:05:16,392
I've learned a few
things about David.

1173
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,107
It's not gonna be his
first night in jail.

1174
01:05:29,472 --> 01:05:31,492
We never really knew him
or what he's capable of.

1175
01:05:31,515 --> 01:05:33,576
You've been digging into his past?

1176
01:05:33,601 --> 01:05:36,301
Oh, rightfully so. He didn't think
to share this with you, did he?

1177
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,646
I'm sure there's a perfectly
good explanation.

1178
01:05:38,647 --> 01:05:39,856
Well, yeah, he's a criminal.

1179
01:05:39,857 --> 01:05:42,192
And that's why he's
behind bars as we speak.

1180
01:05:42,193 --> 01:05:43,985
This could cost him his
college, his future.

1181
01:05:43,986 --> 01:05:45,963
He doesn't have a future, Jade.

1182
01:05:45,988 --> 01:05:48,591
And he's gonna make sure that
you don't have one either.

1183
01:05:50,826 --> 01:05:52,911
This is the kind of guy you
really want to fight for?

1184
01:05:52,912 --> 01:05:55,473
Yes! I don't care about his past.

1185
01:05:55,539 --> 01:05:58,375
There's nothing you can say that will
change the way I feel about him.

She's at home.

1203

She just knew it would make
things harder if she came.

1204

I'm taking you to your car, David.

1205
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,600
You're not coming back to
the lake house with us.

1206
01:06:57,601 --> 01:06:58,935
Hey, hang on. What do you mean?

1207
01:06:58,936 --> 01:07:01,747
Your relationship with
my daughter is over.

1208

It's time to let her go. Let her
have the success she deserves.

Is that what she wants or
is that what you want?

She is not here to
pick you up, is she?

I'll ask her myself.

1212

She's taking the internship.

1213
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:20,724
Yeah, she decided this morning.

1214
01:07:21,834 --> 01:07:23,394
This is just a summer fling.

1215
01:07:23,461 --> 01:07:25,104
It's not real love.

(SCOFFS)

1217
01:07:26,297 --> 01:07:29,233
You're in no position to lecture
me on what real love is.

1218
01:07:29,425 --> 01:07:31,735
You have no idea what
goes on in my marriage.

No.

1220

No, I don't.

1221
01:07:35,097 --> 01:07:37,867
But I know you have
this incredible family.

1222
01:07:37,933 --> 01:07:40,852
I see how you treat them. I would
never treat Jade that way.

1223
01:07:40,853 --> 01:07:42,246
Oh. Oh.

1224
01:07:42,688 --> 01:07:44,540
Tell me, how would you
treat her, David?

1225
01:07:44,607 --> 01:07:46,625
Go ahead, tell me.

1226
01:07:46,984 --> 01:07:48,711
Like that kid in the police report?

1227
01:07:48,778 --> 01:07:50,212
I did a little research.

1228
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:52,256
Is that the kind of person you
think I want for my daughter?

1229
01:07:52,323 --> 01:07:54,717
That was a long time ago.
That's not me.

1230
01:07:56,744 --> 01:08:00,455
I would've thought you would have
learned more from your past.

1231
01:08:00,456 --> 01:08:02,683
I'm sure your father must have.

1232
01:08:04,502 --> 01:08:05,669
Don't you talk about my dad.

1233
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:07,837
No, I mean, everything I hear,
he sounds like a great guy.

1234
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:12,026
Works hard, puts a roof over
your head, does the best he can.

1235
01:08:12,843 --> 01:08:15,224
It was never quite enough for
your mother, though, was it?

1236
01:08:15,805 --> 01:08:17,114
You have nothing.

1237
01:08:17,556 --> 01:08:19,307
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1238
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:22,578
One day you get home early from
school, there's another man there.

1239
01:08:22,978 --> 01:08:24,705
And what do you do, David?

1240
01:08:25,189 --> 01:08:26,791
You beat him.

1241
01:08:26,857 --> 01:08:30,026
You beat him so badly he has to
be taken away in an ambulance.

1242
01:08:30,027 --> 01:08:33,964
So he goes to the hospital, you go
to juvie, and your mom takes off.

1244
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:37,534
You know that love that you
talked about at dinner?

1245
01:08:37,535 --> 01:08:39,515
You're never gonna have that.
It doesn't exist.

1246
01:08:39,537 --> 01:08:42,872
Your story isn't gonna end any
differently than your parents' did.

1247
01:08:42,873 --> 01:08:46,018
Jade will get bored with you.

1248
01:08:46,377 --> 01:08:48,086
Just like your mom got bored.

1249
01:08:48,087 --> 01:08:49,713
And how are you going
to handle yourself when

1250
01:08:49,714 --> 01:08:52,233
that happens again, David? Huh?

1251
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:53,967
Because it will.

1252
01:08:53,968 --> 01:08:55,719
It doesn't matter how hard you try.

1253
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,221
You're not gonna be
able to hang on to her.

1254
01:08:58,222 --> 01:09:00,390
She is gonna get to Brown.

1255
01:09:00,391 --> 01:09:04,829
She is gonna meet somebody like
her, smart, with a future,

1257
01:09:05,271 --> 01:09:07,248
and she's gonna leave.

1258
01:09:07,356 --> 01:09:09,375
And she won't look back.

1259
01:09:09,442 --> 01:09:10,835
You know why?

1260
01:09:14,905 --> 01:09:16,740
Because you're not good enough.

1261
01:09:16,741 --> 01:09:18,843
You're just like your father.

1268
01:09:46,103 --> 01:09:47,746
Never me.

1269
01:09:49,482 --> 01:09:51,459
This is the real you.

1270
01:09:52,068 --> 01:09:54,170

1273
01:10:14,465 --> 01:10:15,900
What happened?

1274
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:17,801
What do you think? David lost it.

1275
01:10:17,802 --> 01:10:19,302
I tried to fend him off, and he...

1276
01:10:19,303 --> 01:10:20,845
I don't believe you.

1277
01:10:20,846 --> 01:10:22,239
Look at me.

1278
01:10:23,265 --> 01:10:24,599
He completely lost control.

1279
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:25,684
I told him you were leaving...

1280
01:10:25,685 --> 01:10:27,477
You told him?
Why would you tell him that?

1281
01:10:27,478 --> 01:10:29,455
Because you wouldn't have.

1282
01:10:29,647 --> 01:10:31,415
And it's time he knows the truth.

1283
01:10:32,358 --> 01:10:34,084
Jade, what...

1284
01:10:35,361 --> 01:10:36,921
No.

1285
01:10:37,655 --> 01:10:40,824
He peppers him with a right,
he peppers him with a left.

1286
01:10:40,825 --> 01:10:43,034
He's got Hugh Butterfield
in the corner.

1287
01:10:43,035 --> 01:10:44,428
(CHUCKLING) What's he up to?

1288
01:10:45,037 --> 01:10:46,388
Damn, did you hit her dad?

1289
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,768
That's messed up, even for you.

us there last night.

come to pick you up?

It's true. You hit him.

That he deserved to be hit?

How? He told me what
happened with your mom.

Why would you keep that a secret?

I wouldn't have cared if
you had just told me.

I was ashamed.

I hate what my mom did to my dad.

his whole life ahead of him.

he knew the conditions.

just a kid with shit luck.

future all he wants...

word about my son

can't say another.

wanted to say goodbye

it away from him.

I got to protect my son now

and talking to you ain't
gonna do him any favors.

Can you at least tell
him that I love him?

I've been going to your
