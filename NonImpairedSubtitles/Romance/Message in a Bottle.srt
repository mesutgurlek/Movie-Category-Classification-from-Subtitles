1
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,620
Where are they?

2
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,140
They're probably just running late.
They'll be here.

3
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:38,700
I see them!

4
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,742
Daddy!

5
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:48,502
How are you, sweetie?

6
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,101
Good to see you.

7
00:02:52,142 --> 00:02:53,421
Hi.
Hi.

8
00:02:53,662 --> 00:02:55,222
Hi there.
How are you?

9
00:02:58,342 --> 00:03:00,222
He's cute. Great!
Thanks.

10
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,340
We got to go.

11
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,340
We should go.
I have my number.

12
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,980
I won't be in Chicago for a few days.
I'm going to the Cape....

13
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,060
Same B & B as last year?
I have the number.

14
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:15,421
Say bye to your mom.

15
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:16,981
Give me a kiss.
Bye, Mom.

16
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,660
I love you.

17
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:23,661
Call me. Anytime.

18
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:25,581
- Bye.
- Love you.

19
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:27,342
Bye.
Bye.

20
00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:36,782
Bye, Mom.

21
00:04:15,102 --> 00:04:17,062
Sorry to be so late, ladies.

22
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,622
Financial consultant.
Recently divorced.

23
00:04:28,103 --> 00:04:30,623
Did you notice the way
he ate his pancakes?

24
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:32,983
He took his time on every bite.

25
00:04:34,142 --> 00:04:35,183
Get a grip.

26
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:39,343
You know what they say about
tall, lanky men, don't you?

27
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:40,944
They have enormous feet.

28
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:43,144
Morning.

29
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:46,983
I happen to know he's going
to the theater today, a matinee.

30
00:04:47,462 --> 00:04:49,344
I think I'll take the harbor tour.

31
00:06:08,905 --> 00:06:10,226
"Dear Catherine:

32
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:13,226
I'm sorry I haven't talked to you
in so long.

33
00:06:13,585 --> 00:06:15,626
I feel I've been lost...

34
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:18,466
...no bearings, no compass.

35
00:06:18,706 --> 00:06:22,586
I kept crashing into things, a little
crazy, I guess.

36
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:26,505
I've never been lost before.

37
00:06:26,826 --> 00:06:28,867
You were my true north.

38
00:06:30,146 --> 00:06:33,587
I could always steer for home
when you were my home.

39
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,424
Forgive me for being so angry
when you left.

40
00:06:37,705 --> 00:06:40,265
I still think
some mistake's been made...

41
00:06:40,505 --> 00:06:43,145
...and I'm waiting for God
to take it back.

42
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,545
But I'm doing better now.

43
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:50,585
The work helps me.

44
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,306
Most of all, you help me.

45
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,507
You came into my dream last night
with that smile...

46
00:06:58,746 --> 00:07:01,026
...that always held me
like a lover...

47
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:03,306
...rocked me like a child.

48
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:07,227
All I remember from the dream...

49
00:07:07,506 --> 00:07:09,226
...is a feeling of peace.

50
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:16,708
I woke up with that feeling...

51
00:07:16,947 --> 00:07:19,907
...and tried to keep it alive
as long as I could.

52
00:07:20,626 --> 00:07:24,387
I'm writing to tell you that
I'm on a journey toward that peace.

53
00:07:25,107 --> 00:07:28,548
And to tell you I'm sorry
about so many things.

54
00:07:30,387 --> 00:07:33,348
I'm sorry I didn't take
better care of you...

55
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:37,627
...so you never spent a minute
being cold or scared or sick."

56
00:07:43,188 --> 00:07:45,629
"I'm sorry I didn't
try harder to find the words...

57
00:07:45,908 --> 00:07:47,546
...to tell you what I was feeling.

58
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:49,947
I'm sorry I never fixed
the screen door.

59
00:07:50,227 --> 00:07:51,427
I fixed it now.

60
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,467
I'm sorry I ever fought with you.

61
00:07:56,027 --> 00:07:58,306
I'm sorry I didn't apologize more.

62
00:07:58,547 --> 00:07:59,947
I was too proud.

63
00:08:00,187 --> 00:08:02,547
I'm sorry I didn't
bring you more compliments...

64
00:08:02,787 --> 00:08:05,908
...on everything you wore and
every way you fixed your hair.

65
00:08:06,226 --> 00:08:08,667
I'm sorry I didn't hold on to you
with so much strength...

66
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:11,108
...that even God
couldn't pull you away."

67
00:08:11,347 --> 00:08:13,228
Signed, "All my love, G."

68
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,708
That is so sad.

69
00:08:17,308 --> 00:08:19,108
It's not that. It's just...

70
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:20,668
...so honest.

71
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:24,348
This could be hundreds of years old.

72
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:26,388
It's typed, Alva.

73
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:32,309
Pretty good.

74
00:08:32,588 --> 00:08:34,228
Meaning you wish you'd written it.

75
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:36,389
I'd have e-mailed her.

76
00:08:36,748 --> 00:08:38,549
Anyway, I know what you wish.

77
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:41,109
You wish it had been addressed
"Dear Theresa."

78
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,149
Come on now, Charlie...

79
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,069
...any girl would want
to be loved like that.

80
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:49,550
To be somebody's "true north"?

81
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:51,191
Are you kidding?

82
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,750
Lonely women, particularly?

83
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,430
Is that how you see me?

84
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,388
Did you talk to anybody on your trip?
Tell any jokes?

85
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:01,469
I had a good time.

86
00:09:01,747 --> 00:09:02,788
Really?

87
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:03,988
Came back a day early.

88
00:09:05,388 --> 00:09:07,109
I happen to like my job.

89
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:10,349
You're in denial.
You should be writing.

90
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:12,990
You better hope I stick to research.

91
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:14,828
I don't think you could
do your column without me.

92
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:19,550
Ever notice that most people here refer
to me as Mr. Toschi, out of respect?

93
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:22,109
I knew you before
your teeth were capped.

94
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,389
I knew you when your step was swift
and your heart was high.

95
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:30,630
Al Giddons, "Lakefront Winter."
Harcourt-Brace, 1948.

96
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:33,229
Thought I made that up.

97
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:58,031
Hey, Jase! How are you?

98
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,152
Hi, Lina.

99
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,151
No, sorry.

100
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,592
I just was expecting him to call.

101
00:10:05,712 --> 00:10:08,432
No, I'm not worried. I just miss him.

102
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:10,189
I know.

103
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,269
What?

104
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:16,869
No, I just got it. Why?

105
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,230
What?

106
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,270
I can't believe he did this.

107
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,070
I can't believe it!

108
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,191
Why are you so annoyed?
It's wrong to print it.

109
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,071
It's private.
It's somebody's intimate thoughts.

110
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:39,991
It's not your letter!

111
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:42,911
I know it's not my letter.
I found it.

112
00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:45,551
Is this personal?
Is that why you're pissed off?

113
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:48,591
I'm not pissed off! I'm just...

114
00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:51,312
...a little pissed off.

115
00:11:12,553 --> 00:11:15,592
You had your chance
at the Christmas party.

116
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,593
Morning, doll.
Theresa?

117
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:21,191
Look at this.

118
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,112
Letters to the paper about
the message in the bottle.

119
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:26,192
What?

120
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:28,752
And two more boxes.
Take those to research.

121
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:31,352
I found him in the mailroom.
Nice ass.

122
00:11:31,632 --> 00:11:33,591
Charlie wants us to drop everything.

123
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:35,512
And do what?
Answer all of them?

124
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:38,073
Go through them and
count the pros and cons.

125
00:11:38,351 --> 00:11:39,672
Get rid of the nutso letters.

126
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:43,472
Then we'll do excerpts. The paper
wants us to milk it. This is big.

127
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:45,513
Bigger than
the low-fat muffin scandal.

128
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:47,712
Bigger than
the mayor and the teacher.

129
00:11:47,953 --> 00:11:49,272
It's amazing.

130
00:11:50,113 --> 00:11:51,912
"Your column sucks the big one."

131
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:53,473
Negative, I think.
Listen.

132
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,073
"If only more men would have
the sensitivity...

133
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:58,753
...to talk about how they feel,
instead of...

134
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:00,994
...hiding behind
the Sports Channel..."

135
00:12:01,273 --> 00:12:03,394
"My niece sent it to me.

136
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:05,674
It might be from the same person.

137
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:07,873
So I'm enclosing it here."

138
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:10,794
What?

139
00:12:12,313 --> 00:12:13,434
What?

140
00:12:14,515 --> 00:12:15,474
"Dear Catherine."

141
00:12:15,913 --> 00:12:18,273
No. Are you kidding? Really?

142
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:20,515
Out loud. Read it out loud.

143
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:26,875
"Dear Catherine:
There isn't an hour without you in it.

144
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:29,035
I mend the boats, test them...

145
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:32,433
...and all the while
the memories come in like the tide.

146
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:35,633
I thought today
of when we were young...

147
00:12:35,913 --> 00:12:38,553
...and you left our world
for a bigger world.

148
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:41,713
I was a lot more scared
than I would admit.

149
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:43,633
I fought my fear...

150
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:46,553
...by telling myself
you'd come back someday...

151
00:12:46,794 --> 00:12:50,553
...and trying to think of the first
thing I'd say when I saw you again.

152
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:53,874
I must have tried out
100 possibilities.

153
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,354
What did I finally say?

154
00:12:56,634 --> 00:12:57,754
Not much.

155
00:12:58,035 --> 00:13:01,154
My mouth wouldn't work,
except to kiss you.

156
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:04,234
When you said, 'I'm here to stay'...

157
00:13:04,474 --> 00:13:06,115
...that said it all.

158
00:13:07,034 --> 00:13:08,594
Well, I'm doing it again.

159
00:13:10,994 --> 00:13:14,274
I keep imagining what I'd say to you
if somehow you came back."

160
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:18,275
Bob. It's Theresa at the Tribune.

161
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,515
I know, it's been a while.

162
00:13:20,755 --> 00:13:22,315
I've got something for you.

163
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:23,715
It's two traces.

164
00:13:23,996 --> 00:13:26,714
A sheet of stationery
has an imprint on it.

165
00:13:26,995 --> 00:13:29,356
Also,
where do I go for a typewriter trace?

166
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,236
The typewriter you're looking for...

167
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:33,917
...is an Olympic Herzfogen 980.

168
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:35,755
German. And old.

169
00:13:35,997 --> 00:13:38,636
Would it have been sold commercially...

170
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:40,516
...in the last 30 years?

171
00:13:40,755 --> 00:13:42,316
Well, it's been re-keyed.

172
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:45,755
People who like manuals
buy these reconditioned.

173
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:49,235
This letter was probably typed
within the last 5 years.

174
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:50,875
So he's out there.

175
00:13:51,155 --> 00:13:52,715
And he could be young.

176
00:13:53,274 --> 00:13:54,075
You'll like this.

177
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:56,716
Remember the report I did?
Cork came back.

178
00:13:56,995 --> 00:13:59,954
It's been in the water
approximately two years.

179
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:01,675
That's it? Two years?

180
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:03,315
Thank you.

181
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:05,516
Don't look at me.

182
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:06,996
Aqua glass.

183
00:14:07,235 --> 00:14:08,196
89...

184
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:10,315
...looks like an "A."

185
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,355
I'm sending you Polaroids.

186
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,437
That sounds great.

187
00:14:25,276 --> 00:14:27,717
You like the baby, then?
Theresa?

188
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:29,677
Theresa!
You're always so busy.

189
00:14:29,957 --> 00:14:32,236
I never get a chance to talk to you.

190
00:14:32,757 --> 00:14:34,236
Hang up!
Hang on one second.

191
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:38,957
Remember the message
on the restaurant wall in Virginia?

192
00:14:39,197 --> 00:14:41,317
The stationery, the logo,
and the typewriter are there.

193
00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:44,318
Hit line five.
She's waiting for you.

194
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:47,038
I never get to talk to him.
Call him back.

195
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:48,397
Can she fax it?

196
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:51,278
Fax it? It's Virginia.
Ellie's House of Crabs.

197
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:53,158
How do I know if
she has a fax machine?

198
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:54,638
Have her fax it.

199
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:56,437
Fine.

200
00:14:57,876 --> 00:15:00,516
Right. Tell me about Bunker Hill.

201
00:15:07,117 --> 00:15:09,157
"To all the ships at sea
and all the ports of call.

202
00:15:09,436 --> 00:15:12,797
To my family and to all
friends and strangers."

203
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,917
No "Dear Catherine"?
Not this time.

204
00:15:15,157 --> 00:15:17,197
The stationery
and typewriter check out.

205
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:21,117
We think maybe this is
the first one or the final one.

206
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:24,197
"This is a message and a prayer.

207
00:15:24,438 --> 00:15:27,317
The message is that my travels
taught me a great truth.

208
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:30,277
I already had what
everyone is searching for...

209
00:15:30,558 --> 00:15:32,198
...and few ever find:

210
00:15:32,438 --> 00:15:35,478
The one person in the world
who I was born to love forever.

211
00:15:35,758 --> 00:15:37,798
A person like me, of the Outer Banks...

212
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:39,557
...and the blue Atlantic mystery."

213
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,439
Outer Banks.
That's North Carolina.

214
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:44,599
Right. But it's about a dozen towns.

215
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:48,038
Only four support a boat-building
and restoring company.

216
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,199
Then we got him.

217
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:52,319
We've got stringers there,
and a sister paper in Wilmington.

218
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:55,199
I bet we find this guy
before the week's out.

219
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,319
Any bets, girls?

220
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,640
What?

221
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:02,679
I want to go.

222
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:04,199
She wants to do it.

223
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:06,157
You find this guy, then what?

224
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:08,797
I don't know. I'm not sure.
But I want to go.

225
00:16:09,117 --> 00:16:11,478
Can't spare you. Need you here.

226
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:17,118
You're the one that sent me to India
for the column on smokestacks.

227
00:16:17,397 --> 00:16:20,518
You sent her to Texas for 3 days,
talking to Marines.

228
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:22,039
That was different.

229
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:24,158
Why do you have to
do this personally?

230
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:26,478
What do you mean?
I'm intrigued, so what?

231
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,519
Intrigued?

232
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,518
What if he's covered in tattoos...

233
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,759
...and has four serious convictions?

234
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:33,279
Tell her.

235
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:36,718
I'm only afraid that...

236
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,999
...your expectations are too high.

237
00:16:39,238 --> 00:16:41,359
I don't have any. This is research.

238
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,320
You're thinking Heathcliff.
You're thinking Hamlet.

239
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,800
This guy is probably Captain Ahab.

240
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,400
Are you saying that I can't go?

241
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,560
It's called a risk, Charlie, right?

242
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:58,160
Something you've been
telling me for two years.

243
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,881
"Take a risk."

244
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,520
Remember when you asked
me to call...

245
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,400
...all the stationery stores
in the Outer Banks area?

246
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,600
I've got other names for you.
I got it.

247
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,840
What? You got what?

248
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:11,561
I called one in Morehead City.

249
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:14,121
They remembered
the little sailboat logo.

250
00:17:14,361 --> 00:17:17,719
They said it was designed
by the customers.

251
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:20,439
It's them.

252
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:21,999
Don't tell Charlie.

253
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:24,399
He'll try and make you
do this over the phone.

254
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,879
You got him, Theresa.

255
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:28,400
Now go knock on his door.

256
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:53,682
Ma'am?

257
00:18:56,722 --> 00:18:58,123
Can I help you?

258
00:19:00,162 --> 00:19:03,603
Sorry, I just admire these
older homes.

259
00:19:03,882 --> 00:19:05,282
You're in real estate?

260
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:07,883
No.

261
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,802
Could I take
a photograph of the house...

262
00:19:13,043 --> 00:19:13,922
...for a publication?

263
00:19:14,164 --> 00:19:15,483
Jehovah's Witness?

264
00:19:15,844 --> 00:19:16,962
No.

265
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,643
Photograph.
Well, I never thought of that.

266
00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:22,323
Can't say yes or no.

267
00:19:22,642 --> 00:19:23,764
And why's that?

268
00:19:24,044 --> 00:19:25,323
That's my son's place.

269
00:19:26,724 --> 00:19:28,284
I live back down...

270
00:19:28,564 --> 00:19:29,523
...thataway.

271
00:19:29,884 --> 00:19:31,924
So you're going to have to ask him.

272
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:35,204
He'll be kicking around the harbor.
Garret Blake.

273
00:19:36,204 --> 00:19:37,683
Never wears a hat.

274
00:19:38,404 --> 00:19:40,362
Great. Thank you.

275
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:42,602
Is it Playboy?

276
00:19:44,402 --> 00:19:45,962
I always admired your covers.

277
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:48,083
Never bought the magazine, though.

278
00:19:51,843 --> 00:19:53,644
Well, there's always tomorrow.

279
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:21,004
Hi.

280
00:20:21,924 --> 00:20:23,404
Oh, hi.

281
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:24,525
Great day, isn't it?

282
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,885
It's a beauty.
Wish I was out on the water.

283
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,446
Yeah, I bet.

284
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,445
Great boat.
Are you restoring it?

285
00:20:33,724 --> 00:20:35,284
Yeah, doing the best I can.

286
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,325
Do you restore boats for a living?

287
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,805
No, I'm just a weekend warrior.

288
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,406
You got a boat that
needs some work done?

289
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:45,445
Actually...

290
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:49,365
I got a man here in town.
He's got a shop. Garret!

291
00:20:50,246 --> 00:20:51,805
He's working on the schooner there.

292
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:54,764
The 40-footer.
Sweet lines on that boat.

293
00:20:55,043 --> 00:20:56,844
You can't beat the old woodies.

294
00:20:57,084 --> 00:20:57,885
Great, thank you.

295
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,244
- You bet. You have a nice day.
- You too.

296
00:21:24,045 --> 00:21:25,006
Hi.

297
00:21:26,406 --> 00:21:29,686
I love the older, the wooden boats.

298
00:21:30,126 --> 00:21:33,486
It must be a 40-footer?
A schooner, right?

299
00:21:33,766 --> 00:21:35,246
It's an Alden Schooner.

300
00:21:36,206 --> 00:21:38,487
1922, out of Maine.

301
00:21:41,527 --> 00:21:42,326
Is she yours?

302
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,127
Nope.

303
00:21:45,447 --> 00:21:47,567
Just putting her back in shape.

304
00:21:49,126 --> 00:21:49,928
Sweet lines.

305
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:55,727
You want to step aboard?

306
00:21:56,807 --> 00:21:57,688
Yeah.

307
00:21:58,927 --> 00:22:01,366
There's some wet spots.

308
00:22:12,805 --> 00:22:13,766
She's a beauty.

309
00:22:15,846 --> 00:22:17,166
Was she in bad shape?

310
00:22:17,847 --> 00:22:18,887
Neglected.

311
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:20,206
Unappreciated.

312
00:22:21,686 --> 00:22:22,646
I know how she feels.

313
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:25,127
Doubt it.

314
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:28,847
You a tourist?

315
00:22:29,328 --> 00:22:32,126
I'm just getting acquainted
with the place, the people.

316
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:35,327
I'm Theresa...

317
00:22:35,568 --> 00:22:36,447
...Osborne.

318
00:22:38,287 --> 00:22:39,168
Garret Blake.

319
00:22:39,807 --> 00:22:41,688
You sound like up north.

320
00:22:42,088 --> 00:22:43,407
- Do I?
- Yup.

321
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:44,967
Chicago.

322
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,287
I'm in research.

323
00:22:48,008 --> 00:22:48,968
On what?

324
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:53,287
Just about everything.
For a newspaper.

325
00:22:54,688 --> 00:22:58,128
Is there anywhere I can do
some sailing while I'm here?

326
00:22:58,688 --> 00:23:00,648
You could rent
a boat on the other side.

327
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:03,489
Oh, no, I mean,
I'm not experienced...

328
00:23:03,728 --> 00:23:04,528
...at all.

329
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:07,448
I'd like to be. I just....

330
00:23:08,128 --> 00:23:10,488
I'm from the Prairie State, so....

331
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,687
I'm a dodo in the water.

332
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,407
Sorry to have interrupted your work.
Thank you.

333
00:23:25,288 --> 00:23:27,408
I'm taking her out tomorrow morning.

334
00:23:27,688 --> 00:23:30,328
Test sail.
Round the point and back.

335
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:32,049
Just about an hour.

336
00:23:33,488 --> 00:23:34,808
Do you want to come along?

337
00:23:37,928 --> 00:23:38,968
That'd be nice.

338
00:23:39,249 --> 00:23:40,568
About seven.

339
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:41,769
Great!

340
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:44,809
If you come earlier...

341
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,530
...I'll be in that diner over there.

342
00:23:46,808 --> 00:23:48,129
Earlier than seven?

343
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:51,729
Great. I'll see you here.

344
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,890
Or at the...

345
00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:55,008
...at the diner.

346
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:27,329
Hi, Chet.
How you doing?

347
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:29,289
Alrighty.
Jesus, Chet!

348
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:33,650
You always have the same
people in here every day.

349
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:38,729
All the tourists go
to the Pancake Palace.

350
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,330
Let them!

351
00:24:42,171 --> 00:24:44,890
And what do you got?
The same fishermen.

352
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,489
A would-be carpenter.

353
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,450
And a nearsighted mechanic.

354
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,130
And a thief who wants
to be a shipwright.

355
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,250
Now don't start any shit, Johnny.

356
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:59,211
A thief is somebody who keeps
property belongs to somebody else.

357
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,211
Am I right?

358
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:03,891
You ain't right if the courts
say you ain't right, right?

359
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,331
Loudmouth asshole.

360
00:25:06,891 --> 00:25:07,851
What'd you say?

361
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:11,891
How'd you know I was talking
to you, Johnny?

362
00:25:12,571 --> 00:25:14,771
I'm calling Pete right now.

363
00:25:15,011 --> 00:25:18,452
You two bust up this place again
and charges will be pressed...

364
00:25:18,732 --> 00:25:20,932
...arrests will be made,
and I ain't bluffing!

365
00:25:21,332 --> 00:25:24,292
Man who's a thief
deserves to be in jail.

366
00:25:25,252 --> 00:25:28,292
I never took a damn thing from you
or anybody in this town.

367
00:25:28,572 --> 00:25:31,292
I say different.
You're a liar, Johnny.

368
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,852
Don't ever call me a liar!

369
00:25:33,091 --> 00:25:34,973
Come on, grab hold of him!

370
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,251
Will you guys get ahold of them?

371
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,650
Will you separate them?

372
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,851
Garret, come here.
Now get off him.

373
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,452
Get over here!

374
00:25:54,371 --> 00:25:55,411
Now leave it alone.

375
00:25:55,692 --> 00:25:57,332
Just walk away for once.

376
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:00,051
He ain't worth it, Garret.

377
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:02,492
Go on.

378
00:26:02,731 --> 00:26:04,532
Didn't you see what he...?

379
00:26:06,412 --> 00:26:07,451
Come on, easy.

380
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:09,012
Settle down, John.
Go ahead, Garret.

381
00:26:09,292 --> 00:26:11,252
He ain't worth it.
Let me go!

382
00:26:11,812 --> 00:26:12,853
It's all over.

383
00:26:38,374 --> 00:26:39,853
Thought you wouldn't come.

384
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:42,934
I came to say I'm not coming.

385
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:48,212
I didn't want to not show,
because I hate people like that.

386
00:26:49,092 --> 00:26:50,732
I'm sorry you saw that.

387
00:26:51,532 --> 00:26:52,572
Does that happen a lot here?

388
00:26:52,853 --> 00:26:55,133
I mean, instead of bowling or....

389
00:27:00,572 --> 00:27:02,053
Maybe I'll see you around.

390
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:04,573
I'm still going to
run her out for a test.

391
00:27:07,012 --> 00:27:08,413
Just a short sail.

392
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:11,653
I don't know, you know.
What if you got mad at me?

393
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:13,574
It's a small boat.

394
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:16,333
I don't like fighting, Theresa.

395
00:27:17,734 --> 00:27:18,694
Bowling, either.

396
00:27:21,454 --> 00:27:23,014
Before you go, would you...

397
00:27:23,253 --> 00:27:25,294
...untie that, toss it in?

398
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:27,535
Appreciate it.

399
00:27:40,055 --> 00:27:41,176
Thanks.

400
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:55,576
Hi.

401
00:28:08,135 --> 00:28:09,454
Where am I not in your way?

402
00:28:10,334 --> 00:28:11,735
I'll get around you.

403
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,414
Should I just jump over?

404
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:27,975
I'm sorry, I...

405
00:28:29,135 --> 00:28:31,094
...I used to be better with people.

406
00:28:33,135 --> 00:28:34,695
So you used to be charming?

407
00:28:36,616 --> 00:28:38,095
Sorry I missed that.

408
00:29:03,137 --> 00:29:04,936
Who is that man in the diner?

409
00:29:06,617 --> 00:29:07,937
It's an old thing.

410
00:29:08,617 --> 00:29:10,494
I don't want to pry.

411
00:29:10,896 --> 00:29:12,175
How old?

412
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:19,016
So this is what you do?
Research?

413
00:29:20,815 --> 00:29:23,096
No, actually,
it's called conversation.

414
00:29:25,336 --> 00:29:27,776
I might be able to help you.
I have a degree.

415
00:29:30,296 --> 00:29:32,657
So you stole his girlfriend
in the eighth grade?

416
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:35,416
No.

417
00:29:36,697 --> 00:29:38,016
I married his sister.

418
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:42,537
So, your turn.

419
00:29:42,817 --> 00:29:43,617
Right?

420
00:29:44,257 --> 00:29:45,376
Okay.

421
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,058
Still married?

422
00:29:47,738 --> 00:29:48,617
No.

423
00:29:49,778 --> 00:29:50,577
You?

424
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:51,657
No.

425
00:29:53,178 --> 00:29:54,217
I have a son.

426
00:29:55,217 --> 00:29:56,338
A great son.

427
00:29:57,937 --> 00:29:58,737
Date much?

428
00:29:59,538 --> 00:30:00,498
No.

429
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:02,258
You?

430
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:05,858
You're getting the hang of this.

431
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:07,578
Watch your head with the boom.

432
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:51,419
Did you hear from your mama?

433
00:30:53,338 --> 00:30:54,658
Got a letter.

434
00:30:56,058 --> 00:30:57,458
Still doesn't like you.

435
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,299
No fooling.

436
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,979
Looks a little small for you.

437
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:12,460
What?

438
00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:13,859
The jacket.

439
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:15,259
What jac...

440
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,260
- It's hers.
- Whose?

441
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:21,819
Woman from today.

442
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:23,899
She left it on board.

443
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,660
Well, did you tell her?
Did you call her?

444
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,019
No.

445
00:31:29,261 --> 00:31:32,617
I thought maybe you'd drop it off
for me in town at the hotel.

446
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:36,139
I'm not going to do it.
Take her the jacket.

447
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:40,059
You don't want to see her again?

448
00:31:41,938 --> 00:31:42,739
Maybe.

449
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:44,139
So?

450
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:48,299
So, Dad, it's not an easy thing.

451
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:52,660
You be her.

452
00:31:53,219 --> 00:31:54,180
I'll be you.

453
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,660
Here's your jacket.

454
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,179
Jackets like that...

455
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,020
...don't come along
every week, you know.

456
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:17,261
One second.

457
00:32:24,621 --> 00:32:25,421
Hi.

458
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:26,462
You forgot this.

459
00:32:26,701 --> 00:32:27,982
Thank you.

460
00:32:28,661 --> 00:32:30,701
I stayed in.
I didn't even notice.

461
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:32,461
Thanks.

462
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:35,781
You want to come in?

463
00:32:37,061 --> 00:32:38,262
Yeah.

464
00:32:43,421 --> 00:32:44,699
Nice place.

465
00:32:46,061 --> 00:32:48,261
It's Victorian, 1911.

466
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:51,059
Made into an inn in 1944.

467
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,580
But...

468
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,700
...you probably knew all that stuff.

469
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,021
I've never been in here.

470
00:32:58,699 --> 00:32:59,501
Oh, well.

471
00:33:00,221 --> 00:33:02,581
Why would you be in here?
You're from here.

472
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:04,661
This is your hometown.

473
00:33:08,341 --> 00:33:10,301
I had a really good time today.

474
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:13,061
The boat did well.

475
00:33:13,582 --> 00:33:15,782
We didn't have to bail or anything.

476
00:33:21,821 --> 00:33:23,862
Thanks for bringing the jacket.

477
00:33:24,142 --> 00:33:25,462
You're welcome.

478
00:33:27,062 --> 00:33:29,341
I just said thank you
about eight times...

479
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:32,302
...because I have no idea
what to say.

480
00:33:32,903 --> 00:33:36,662
I wonder why you're here, because
you don't know what to say either.

481
00:33:36,903 --> 00:33:38,104
I'm wondering that too.

482
00:33:46,783 --> 00:33:47,982
You eat meat?

483
00:33:50,024 --> 00:33:51,143
Eat red meat?

484
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:53,223
Sometimes.

485
00:33:53,863 --> 00:33:56,222
I make a perfect steak.

486
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,383
It's the best thing I do.

487
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,622
- You're bragging.
- I know.

488
00:34:05,822 --> 00:34:07,222
But it's true.

489
00:34:08,222 --> 00:34:11,102
Well, that's very interesting.
Thanks for telling me.

490
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:15,702
I'd like to make you one...

491
00:34:16,102 --> 00:34:17,222
...tomorrow night.

492
00:34:17,503 --> 00:34:18,622
You would?

493
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:27,143
You know, on the boat today...

494
00:34:27,423 --> 00:34:29,223
...I had a good time too.

495
00:34:36,064 --> 00:34:37,343
What time?

496
00:34:38,824 --> 00:34:40,304
Six.

497
00:34:41,464 --> 00:34:43,503
It's 18 Foster Lane.

498
00:34:43,865 --> 00:34:44,824
I know.

499
00:34:45,904 --> 00:34:46,784
You do?

500
00:34:48,264 --> 00:34:49,585
I know...

501
00:34:49,824 --> 00:34:51,785
...it's got to be on the water.
Right?

502
00:34:52,903 --> 00:34:55,345
Right. Everything's on the water.

503
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,145
- Night.
- See you.

504
00:35:22,023 --> 00:35:23,824
Hi.
Hi.

505
00:35:24,785 --> 00:35:25,824
You found it.

506
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:30,624
Come in.

507
00:35:31,184 --> 00:35:33,144
I didn't know you were so close.

508
00:35:33,505 --> 00:35:34,825
You walked!

509
00:35:36,225 --> 00:35:37,345
I hope you like red.

510
00:35:37,825 --> 00:35:39,865
I do. I already have one opened.

511
00:35:42,864 --> 00:35:44,065
You need some help?

512
00:35:44,305 --> 00:35:45,105
No.

513
00:35:45,385 --> 00:35:46,344
Just...

514
00:35:46,586 --> 00:35:48,226
...make yourself welcome.

515
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:51,826
- Can I pour you a glass?
- Yeah, please.

516
00:35:57,026 --> 00:35:58,506
What a great house!

517
00:36:00,066 --> 00:36:01,466
The light in here...

518
00:36:14,987 --> 00:36:17,187
I love this boat painting.

519
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:19,866
It's incredible.
You can hear it, almost.

520
00:36:20,105 --> 00:36:21,225
The wind.

521
00:36:22,385 --> 00:36:24,265
Is it a local artist?

522
00:36:25,065 --> 00:36:26,626
It's my wife, Catherine.

523
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:30,146
She died two years ago.

524
00:36:34,065 --> 00:36:35,386
I'm sorry.

525
00:37:05,507 --> 00:37:06,548
Do you paint also?

526
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,628
No.

527
00:37:15,507 --> 00:37:18,228
My dad died when I was in college.

528
00:37:18,508 --> 00:37:21,467
I remember my mom kept
one of his shirts...

529
00:37:21,747 --> 00:37:24,708
...on the back of a chair
in my parents' bedroom.

530
00:37:25,028 --> 00:37:27,389
And she probably
left it there for....

531
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:31,786
Maybe it's still there,
I don't know.

532
00:38:07,388 --> 00:38:09,508
Hey, Garret....

533
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:12,029
Look, I was nervous...

534
00:38:12,268 --> 00:38:14,908
...so I drank too much wine.

535
00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:19,029
But listen, there's something
that I should tell you.

536
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:21,069
I was nervous too.

537
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:24,669
I just....

538
00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:29,470
What?

539
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,230
I didn't....

540
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:40,029
I don't do this.

541
00:38:40,347 --> 00:38:41,388
Thank God.

542
00:38:41,628 --> 00:38:43,187
I don't do this either.

543
00:38:43,428 --> 00:38:44,708
I'm not good at this.

544
00:38:49,749 --> 00:38:52,628
For two people that don't do it,
we do it pretty well.

545
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:01,469
Does it feel cold enough for a fire?

546
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:10,709
I thought we were still in love.

547
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,230
But maybe I didn't even
think about it...

548
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:18,189
...because I had my son,
my work, my husband.

549
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:21,190
I was on my way to becoming a writer.

550
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,189
And David and I...

551
00:39:23,471 --> 00:39:26,590
...were even talking about
having a second child.

552
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,190
Can you believe that?

553
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,991
Then one day I was just
driving along...

554
00:39:35,471 --> 00:39:36,670
...and I saw them.

555
00:39:38,551 --> 00:39:40,351
David and this woman...

556
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,510
...walking into the park.

557
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,711
And it was just a glimpse.
It was a second.

558
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:51,429
And I knew.

559
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:57,469
I sat there in my car. I didn't
shut off the engine. I just sat...

560
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,351
...for an hour and a half.

561
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,270
You're faced with the impossible...

562
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,270
...and it takes an hour and a half.

563
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:16,951
It was going on almost a year.

564
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,392
I can't believe I just
told you all that.

565
00:40:28,832 --> 00:40:32,032
I mean, this stuff
happens to everybody, right?

566
00:40:34,472 --> 00:40:36,753
But it happened to you, Theresa.

567
00:40:40,353 --> 00:40:41,752
And I'm sorry.

568
00:40:46,872 --> 00:40:49,753
That kind of stuff
happen in St. Claire?

569
00:40:50,793 --> 00:40:53,353
Everything happens in St. Claire...

570
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:56,032
...eventually.

571
00:41:03,631 --> 00:41:06,510
Tell me about Catherine.

572
00:41:11,191 --> 00:41:12,231
Well...

573
00:41:14,552 --> 00:41:16,431
...we grew up together.

574
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:18,592
She was kind of....

575
00:41:23,392 --> 00:41:26,752
People were drawn to her
by her smile...

576
00:41:27,192 --> 00:41:28,473
...her enthusiasm.

577
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:34,593
She could brighten up
a whole room...

578
00:41:34,873 --> 00:41:36,273
...whole town.

579
00:41:40,233 --> 00:41:42,753
I called her Saint Catherine.

580
00:41:47,874 --> 00:41:49,194
How did she die?

581
00:41:53,593 --> 00:41:54,793
She was ill.

582
00:41:57,313 --> 00:41:58,594
She was fragile.

583
00:42:00,073 --> 00:42:01,034
I'm sorry.

584
00:42:05,235 --> 00:42:06,114
It's all right.

585
00:42:06,475 --> 00:42:07,274
It's okay.

586
00:42:09,155 --> 00:42:10,635
Have you lived here
your whole life?

587
00:42:10,874 --> 00:42:11,753
Not yet.

588
00:42:14,793 --> 00:42:15,913
This place...

589
00:42:17,072 --> 00:42:19,353
...used to be all dirt roads
and marsh grass.

590
00:42:19,592 --> 00:42:20,473
Really?

591
00:42:21,112 --> 00:42:22,433
My mom hated it here.

592
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:25,553
She took me away to Virginia
when I was ten.

593
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:27,794
But I came back when I was 16...

594
00:42:29,473 --> 00:42:30,874
...and never left.

595
00:42:31,514 --> 00:42:33,794
I missed it.
I missed the smell of it...

596
00:42:34,073 --> 00:42:35,713
...working on the water...

597
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,874
...missed my dad.

598
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:41,434
The quiet.

599
00:42:43,634 --> 00:42:44,914
The wind.

600
00:42:45,474 --> 00:42:47,515
The wind?
You call that wind?

601
00:42:47,954 --> 00:42:48,995
The wind...

602
00:42:49,515 --> 00:42:51,554
...in Chicago in the wintertime...

603
00:42:52,635 --> 00:42:55,594
...you walk with your back to it
or it cuts your face.

604
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:56,836
Takes your breath away.

605
00:43:01,195 --> 00:43:03,155
We got the oldest oak tree...

606
00:43:03,435 --> 00:43:04,754
...in both Carolinas.

607
00:43:05,436 --> 00:43:07,715
You try and top that.

608
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:14,598
I just want to be close.

609
00:44:48,197 --> 00:44:49,516
Watch the dust.

610
00:44:53,716 --> 00:44:55,356
She took a look at my plans...

611
00:44:55,597 --> 00:44:57,316
...and never said a word.

612
00:44:58,437 --> 00:45:01,077
A week later she had it on canvas.

613
00:45:01,677 --> 00:45:03,877
This was going to be the first.

614
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:08,757
Designing and building
my own boats...

615
00:45:09,557 --> 00:45:10,957
...that was the plan.

616
00:45:12,678 --> 00:45:14,957
This was going to be
my signature boat...

617
00:45:15,198 --> 00:45:16,757
...the one we'd never sell.

618
00:45:18,998 --> 00:45:20,558
And when will you finish it?

619
00:45:24,758 --> 00:45:27,118
I haven't touched it in two years.

620
00:45:28,918 --> 00:45:30,038
Someday.

621
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:31,439
Right.

622
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:33,679
Someday.

623
00:45:35,479 --> 00:45:37,200
And you'll take me out
on that boat?

624
00:45:37,478 --> 00:45:40,599
Around the point, where the wind
will scare me to death?

625
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,959
There'll be no wind tonight.

626
00:45:49,518 --> 00:45:50,798
And you know that?

627
00:45:53,077 --> 00:45:54,877
I'm the son of a fisherman.

628
00:45:55,279 --> 00:45:56,997
You watch the Weather Channel.

629
00:45:58,198 --> 00:46:00,157
Will you sail with me tonight?

630
00:46:05,038 --> 00:46:06,838
I go back in a few days.

631
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:10,999
And I can't change that,
because my son's coming home.

632
00:46:11,598 --> 00:46:14,799
I don't know if this makes sense.
Maybe...

633
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,159
Okay.

634
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,159
Well, that's a mistake...

635
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:31,759
...letting her taste your coffee.

636
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:33,879
Well, she liked it last night.

637
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,880
She was just being polite.

638
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,801
Nobody likes it, take my word.

639
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,321
Be good.

640
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:44,641
Oh, Lord.

641
00:46:45,161 --> 00:46:46,041
Now what?

642
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:51,881
Go easy.

643
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:01,358
Hold it right there.

644
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,479
You stay out of our way!

645
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,039
You're not welcome here, Johnny.

646
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,599
You better stay out of our way!
Both of you!

647
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,519
Guess the courts
turned you down again?

648
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,560
It's not your business.
It's settled.

649
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,760
No, we just want the paintings.

650
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,359
They were part of our life here, Marta.

651
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,760
The only one who sees them is you.

652
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,680
People should see them.

653
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,560
Please, Garret.

654
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,840
It's all you left us of her.

655
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,120
That's the first time you
called me her killer, Hank...

656
00:47:26,361 --> 00:47:27,320
...at least to my face.

657
00:47:27,561 --> 00:47:28,840
Nobody killed her.

658
00:47:29,081 --> 00:47:31,880
He left her alone when
she was sick and weak.

659
00:47:32,161 --> 00:47:34,361
- She wanted to come home to us!
- This was her home!

660
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,761
Now he's killing her mother.

661
00:47:36,002 --> 00:47:37,961
I hear her heart break
every goddamn day.

662
00:47:38,201 --> 00:47:39,681
I gave you everything of hers.

663
00:47:39,921 --> 00:47:41,881
The paintings!
You got yourself another woman.

664
00:47:42,161 --> 00:47:44,761
What the hell do you care?
You son of a bitch.

665
00:47:45,001 --> 00:47:46,401
Just stay out of this.

666
00:47:46,641 --> 00:47:47,762
Step aside!

667
00:47:51,641 --> 00:47:52,681
She painted them here.

668
00:47:53,202 --> 00:47:54,241
She hung them here.

669
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:57,841
She was the last to touch them!
That's how it'll stay!

670
00:47:58,082 --> 00:47:59,802
All right! All right.

671
00:48:00,082 --> 00:48:02,122
This is what you want, isn't it?

672
00:48:02,642 --> 00:48:04,602
If I cut it up
you can all have a piece.

673
00:48:04,842 --> 00:48:06,042
You can all have a piece of her!

674
00:48:06,602 --> 00:48:07,882
Just set it down, Dad.

675
00:48:08,123 --> 00:48:09,840
Step aside!

676
00:48:12,722 --> 00:48:14,000
My God...

677
00:48:14,881 --> 00:48:17,001
...is this what she is to you?

678
00:48:19,042 --> 00:48:22,002
Something to fight over, pull apart?
Look at you.

679
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:24,642
All three of you
have blood in your eyes.

680
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:26,242
Is that for Catherine?

681
00:48:26,722 --> 00:48:30,762
Or is that so you can walk around and
beat your chest like a bunch of apes?

682
00:48:31,002 --> 00:48:32,402
Goddamn it, you're outside of this.

683
00:48:32,682 --> 00:48:34,161
Well, I loved her too.

684
00:48:34,482 --> 00:48:36,602
And I want something
to remember her by.

685
00:48:36,842 --> 00:48:38,402
Piece of this will do.

686
00:48:44,363 --> 00:48:45,483
She'd hate this!

687
00:48:45,883 --> 00:48:47,003
She'd hate it, Hank.

688
00:48:47,282 --> 00:48:48,604
Dodge is right.
She'd hate this...

689
00:48:48,882 --> 00:48:50,282
...worse than dying!

690
00:49:10,244 --> 00:49:11,364
Crazy people.

691
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,404
They're only half the war.

692
00:49:17,364 --> 00:49:20,004
You saw them.
You heard what they said.

693
00:49:21,482 --> 00:49:24,082
But you carry your half around
pretty good too.

694
00:51:48,566 --> 00:51:50,366
Are you okay with this?

695
00:51:58,206 --> 00:51:59,486
Until you...

696
00:52:04,407 --> 00:52:08,247
...I didn't even think about
being close to anybody else.

697
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,486
Sometimes...

698
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:19,168
...I still feel her. She's...

699
00:52:19,967 --> 00:52:21,087
...here.

700
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:24,928
And I don't want to
cheat you, Theresa.

701
00:53:23,849 --> 00:53:25,649
You're going to eat
that whole bag?

702
00:53:25,888 --> 00:53:27,689
Why do you have
two bags of marshmallows?

703
00:53:28,089 --> 00:53:29,209
Ammo.

704
00:54:07,968 --> 00:54:09,288
Wait.

705
00:54:12,089 --> 00:54:13,810
It's so great here.

706
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:34,570
Hi.

707
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:39,050
It was so nice outside.

708
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:42,251
I decided to set the table out there.
Is that okay?

709
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:46,331
You said to come in, right?

710
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:48,371
I know.

711
00:54:49,611 --> 00:54:51,971
We can eat
in the kitchen if you want.

712
00:54:52,211 --> 00:54:56,411
And I got angel food cake,
so I hope your dad likes cake.

713
00:55:04,572 --> 00:55:06,372
I was going to put that back.

714
00:55:10,092 --> 00:55:13,211
Look, I just didn't know
where the boundaries were.

715
00:55:19,131 --> 00:55:21,570
I didn't know where
the boundaries were either.

716
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,570
Let me get this
out of the way. I'm sorry.

717
00:55:24,851 --> 00:55:25,730
I really...

718
00:55:28,571 --> 00:55:29,370
Let me get it.

719
00:55:29,651 --> 00:55:31,132
Let me clean it up, okay?

720
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:35,131
- I'll get a rag. I can do it.
- I'll get it.

721
00:55:35,371 --> 00:55:36,412
I said, I'll get it!

722
00:55:40,331 --> 00:55:42,291
Just give me a minute.

723
00:56:03,533 --> 00:56:04,812
So you're the jacket.

724
00:56:06,413 --> 00:56:07,454
Yeah, that's me.

725
00:56:07,693 --> 00:56:10,213
You were looking around here
a couple days ago.

726
00:56:10,453 --> 00:56:11,733
Find what you wanted?

727
00:56:13,093 --> 00:56:14,133
I don't know.

728
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,854
I'm Theresa.

729
00:56:18,814 --> 00:56:19,934
Dodge.

730
00:56:20,853 --> 00:56:22,053
Like the pickup.

731
00:56:23,054 --> 00:56:25,774
He said you were pretty.
He should've said beautiful.

732
00:56:26,413 --> 00:56:28,134
Why didn't he inherit that charm?

733
00:56:29,212 --> 00:56:31,572
You had a fight.
That's a good sign.

734
00:56:32,372 --> 00:56:33,572
I made a mistake.

735
00:56:35,533 --> 00:56:38,052
I moved something
out of its place.

736
00:56:40,332 --> 00:56:42,293
Don't pay that any mind.

737
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:43,932
He's still not right about it.

738
00:56:44,253 --> 00:56:47,053
It's like a truck hit him.
Swear to God.

739
00:56:50,732 --> 00:56:54,413
Clams, better here than anywhere.
Come on inside.

740
00:56:55,493 --> 00:56:57,133
It's pretty crowded in there.

741
00:56:59,533 --> 00:57:01,013
You want to take a walk?

742
00:57:06,773 --> 00:57:08,095
He won't tell you much.

743
00:57:08,334 --> 00:57:10,855
The man talks
about as much as a fish.

744
00:57:11,414 --> 00:57:12,453
Anyway...

745
00:57:12,694 --> 00:57:15,254
...wasn't good
right from the beginning.

746
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:18,534
Her family thought
that she would be the one...

747
00:57:18,774 --> 00:57:21,894
...to bust out of here
and just shake the world.

748
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:24,055
Garret was too much like them.

749
00:57:24,295 --> 00:57:27,255
They thought, anyway,
that he would be...

750
00:57:28,735 --> 00:57:31,535
...an anchor around her,
keep her life small.

751
00:57:33,215 --> 00:57:34,254
How did she die?

752
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:39,535
Pregnancy just took
the stuffing right out of her.

753
00:57:41,414 --> 00:57:44,293
Keeled over at her parents' house
and they kept her there.

754
00:57:44,535 --> 00:57:48,135
So Garret went over
and kicked the door down.

755
00:57:48,414 --> 00:57:49,973
Carried her out.

756
00:57:50,334 --> 00:57:51,735
She was glad too.

757
00:57:53,295 --> 00:57:56,734
He took care of her
the best he could...

758
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:00,055
...for about a month, I guess.
And then....

759
00:58:01,055 --> 00:58:02,535
Well, she just...

760
00:58:02,774 --> 00:58:04,055
...gave out.

761
00:58:11,295 --> 00:58:14,096
Now you know why Garret
don't talk much.

762
00:58:15,416 --> 00:58:17,535
Because his old man never shuts up.

763
00:58:17,776 --> 00:58:19,415
Can we eat now?

764
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:28,176
You ought to
knock down some walls.

765
00:58:28,416 --> 00:58:30,137
It's getting too crowded in there.

766
00:58:30,697 --> 00:58:31,975
Can't afford it.

767
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,777
Do the work ourselves.

768
00:58:34,016 --> 00:58:36,137
Just end up looking like a boat.

769
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:37,616
Add a deck.

770
00:58:37,856 --> 00:58:38,977
A couple of rooms.

771
00:58:39,256 --> 00:58:42,138
Why? You thinking about moving in?

772
00:58:45,697 --> 00:58:48,497
Not in a million years.
You'd like that though, wouldn't you?

773
00:58:48,777 --> 00:58:49,817
Keep your eye on me.

774
00:58:50,097 --> 00:58:52,295
He's afraid I'm going to
go back to my old habit.

775
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:53,855
Anybody want any cake?

776
00:58:54,095 --> 00:58:55,415
I used to drink like a fish.

777
00:58:55,655 --> 00:58:57,855
It ruined my health.
It's no deep, dark secret.

778
00:58:58,135 --> 00:59:00,855
Well, it's no citizen award
either.

779
00:59:01,136 --> 00:59:03,096
Two beers a day, that's my limit.

780
00:59:03,336 --> 00:59:04,976
Change the subject?

781
00:59:06,496 --> 00:59:07,536
Yes.

782
00:59:10,456 --> 00:59:13,096
The subject is change.
People change.

783
00:59:13,336 --> 00:59:16,136
Even you.
That is the subject.

784
00:59:16,936 --> 00:59:18,336
Good dinner.

785
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:23,578
You were the best thing about it.

786
00:59:23,817 --> 00:59:27,936
If I was about 150 years younger,
you'd be in trouble, young lady.

787
00:59:30,017 --> 00:59:31,218
Where you going?

788
00:59:32,577 --> 00:59:34,777
Taking my dessert on the beach.

789
00:59:35,017 --> 00:59:36,137
Thanks.

790
00:59:42,657 --> 00:59:44,138
He likes me.

791
00:59:45,697 --> 00:59:46,577
Well, he's a...

792
00:59:46,939 --> 00:59:48,258
...good man.

793
00:59:50,618 --> 00:59:52,898
He said you were a pain in the ass.

794
00:59:57,098 --> 00:59:58,658
Kidding. That was me.

795
01:00:00,899 --> 01:00:02,298
Well, he's right.

796
01:00:04,577 --> 01:00:06,777
You are the best thing
about this dinner.

797
01:00:07,777 --> 01:00:09,817
And this day...

798
01:00:11,777 --> 01:00:13,898
...and this year.

799
01:00:18,377 --> 01:00:20,178
I wish it was simpler.

800
01:00:21,857 --> 01:00:23,498
I wish it was easier.

801
01:00:26,577 --> 01:00:28,058
And I'm sorry.

802
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:15,257
Well, I'm not expecting flowers, but...

803
01:01:15,499 --> 01:01:17,059
...will we call each other?

804
01:01:17,818 --> 01:01:18,779
Well...

805
01:01:19,417 --> 01:01:21,138
...look, I was kind of...

806
01:01:21,419 --> 01:01:22,899
...hoping for flowers.

807
01:01:30,459 --> 01:01:32,100
I could live here.

808
01:01:35,179 --> 01:01:36,660
I didn't say that to scare you.

809
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,020
I scared you, didn't I?

810
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:42,299
No.

811
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,060
So will you come and visit me?

812
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:47,821
You mean inland?

813
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,901
I don't go inland.

814
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:52,420
We have a lake.

815
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,901
A big lake.

816
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:58,660
Okay. I'll just go back to
my work and my son and...

817
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,460
...you'll just forget about me, right?

818
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,541
Every day.

819
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:12,142
I've got your number, sailor.

820
01:02:12,741 --> 01:02:14,622
And you've got mine. So....

821
01:02:27,301 --> 01:02:28,261
Bye.

822
01:03:54,182 --> 01:03:56,142
And then what happened?
Later, later.

823
01:03:57,543 --> 01:03:59,503
The wanderer returns.
How are you?

824
01:04:00,104 --> 01:04:02,062
Yeah? So, solve your mystery?

825
01:04:02,863 --> 01:04:04,583
There was no mystery.

826
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,743
He lost his wife, Catherine.

827
01:04:07,383 --> 01:04:08,702
She was an artist.

828
01:04:08,944 --> 01:04:11,222
And dead but not forgotten.

829
01:04:11,503 --> 01:04:14,383
Right. So that's it,
end of story?

830
01:04:14,664 --> 01:04:17,024
Basically, yeah.
There's no story.

831
01:04:17,543 --> 01:04:19,983
Kind of like...
Was it me that said that?

832
01:04:21,103 --> 01:04:22,063
So!

833
01:04:22,343 --> 01:04:24,384
Toodle-loo, on your way.
That's enough.

834
01:04:26,945 --> 01:04:27,903
Any regrets?

835
01:04:29,303 --> 01:04:30,105
Zip.

836
01:04:30,344 --> 01:04:31,824
No? Good.

837
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:37,664
So, what was she like?

838
01:04:41,065 --> 01:04:44,186
She's beautiful and wispy and...

839
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:46,266
...a great artist.

840
01:04:46,785 --> 01:04:48,183
And she's everywhere.

841
01:04:48,423 --> 01:04:49,823
She's in his house.

842
01:04:50,063 --> 01:04:52,183
She's in the shop.

843
01:04:52,863 --> 01:04:53,823
The whole town knew her.

844
01:04:54,104 --> 01:04:55,503
Is he still in love with her?

845
01:04:56,944 --> 01:04:58,064
She isn't gone.

846
01:05:38,465 --> 01:05:41,066
That's for you.
And that's very interesting.

847
01:05:59,145 --> 01:06:00,704
Research. This is Theresa.

848
01:06:01,264 --> 01:06:02,465
Hi.

849
01:06:02,945 --> 01:06:04,224
It's me.

850
01:06:05,824 --> 01:06:07,025
Garret.

851
01:06:07,665 --> 01:06:08,785
I know.

852
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:12,426
Sorry, I've been...

853
01:06:13,265 --> 01:06:15,146
I'm finishing the boat.

854
01:06:16,425 --> 01:06:17,305
My boat.

855
01:06:18,666 --> 01:06:20,386
I just wanted to tell you.

856
01:06:21,106 --> 01:06:22,506
How are you?

857
01:06:24,706 --> 01:06:26,746
It's been a quiet few weeks.

858
01:06:30,226 --> 01:06:31,506
I didn't know...

859
01:06:31,746 --> 01:06:33,067
...what to say.

860
01:06:34,546 --> 01:06:36,026
I still don't.

861
01:06:36,906 --> 01:06:38,307
Need some help?

862
01:06:39,506 --> 01:06:41,866
I was counting on it.

863
01:06:44,107 --> 01:06:45,148
Question:

864
01:06:45,387 --> 01:06:48,587
Were we just a casual thing
or something else?

865
01:06:49,067 --> 01:06:51,187
Possibly a beginning?

866
01:06:51,427 --> 01:06:53,468
Just answers, no pressure.

867
01:06:57,667 --> 01:07:00,267
Just a playboy?
Nail those tourist women.

868
01:07:00,507 --> 01:07:01,708
I've only...

869
01:07:02,628 --> 01:07:05,268
...cared about two women in my whole
life.

870
01:07:05,748 --> 01:07:07,067
Catherine and...?

871
01:07:07,309 --> 01:07:09,107
Some city girl.

872
01:07:09,509 --> 01:07:10,787
Big mouth.

873
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,226
Pushy.

874
01:07:14,067 --> 01:07:15,187
Thanks.

875
01:07:16,386 --> 01:07:18,667
You just called
to tell me about the boat?

876
01:07:18,906 --> 01:07:19,947
No.

877
01:07:20,627 --> 01:07:21,587
I miss you.

878
01:07:23,467 --> 01:07:25,266
I miss all of it.

879
01:07:29,826 --> 01:07:32,027
Why don't you come see me, Garret?

880
01:07:33,667 --> 01:07:36,387
It's just a visit.
It's not a promise.

881
01:07:38,028 --> 01:07:39,428
Is that enough?

882
01:07:40,547 --> 01:07:43,108
Listen, you think I'm betting on us,
but I'm not.

883
01:07:43,347 --> 01:07:45,388
I'm just as scared as you are.

884
01:07:46,389 --> 01:07:48,268
And I miss you too.

885
01:07:50,709 --> 01:07:52,428
Okay. When?

886
01:07:53,508 --> 01:07:55,949
When should I come?

887
01:07:57,348 --> 01:07:58,829
Yesterday.

888
01:07:59,948 --> 01:08:01,430
You're not coming by boat,
are you?

889
01:08:01,669 --> 01:08:02,548
No.

890
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:05,109
Jet Ski? Windsurfer?

891
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:16,830
So behave yourself.

892
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:18,630
You got your ticket?

893
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:22,747
Of course I have my ticket.

894
01:08:23,387 --> 01:08:24,789
Got my name on all my clothes.

895
01:08:25,069 --> 01:08:27,348
And I got a quarter for a phone call.

896
01:08:27,788 --> 01:08:29,668
You got a gift for that kid of hers?

897
01:08:30,668 --> 01:08:32,788
Get one at the airplane gift shop.

898
01:08:33,549 --> 01:08:36,429
Don't get into any fights
or anything.

899
01:08:37,109 --> 01:08:37,989
There it comes.

900
01:08:38,308 --> 01:08:40,108
Right on time,
just like your old man.

901
01:08:40,388 --> 01:08:41,669
Don't throw your back out.

902
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:43,629
Take your pills.

903
01:08:44,309 --> 01:08:48,829
By my count, there should be 2 beers
left in the fridge when I get back.

904
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:52,230
That's a sorry occupation,
counting other people's beers.

905
01:08:52,469 --> 01:08:55,029
If you get Kenny or
any tourist kids to score you beer...

906
01:08:55,269 --> 01:08:56,390
...I'll hear about it.

907
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:58,670
I got two counties covered.

908
01:09:02,229 --> 01:09:04,270
That lady sure got you gut-hooked.

909
01:09:06,191 --> 01:09:07,590
How'd you get to be so mean?

910
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:09,750
See you in a week.

911
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:14,030
The hell you say!

912
01:09:14,831 --> 01:09:17,270
Not with your
plane ticket on the seat here!

913
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:28,711
Good dog.

914
01:09:53,111 --> 01:09:54,751
I think he's here, Mom.

915
01:09:56,431 --> 01:09:57,471
Okay.

916
01:10:01,551 --> 01:10:02,751
You're kind of nervous.

917
01:10:03,031 --> 01:10:04,071
Really?

918
01:10:04,311 --> 01:10:05,711
I look great though, right?

919
01:10:06,192 --> 01:10:07,150
Okay.

920
01:10:07,392 --> 01:10:09,032
Okay, is what I meant.

921
01:10:15,152 --> 01:10:16,712
You made it.

922
01:10:18,471 --> 01:10:19,352
Come in.

923
01:10:22,432 --> 01:10:24,953
Jason?
- Hello.

924
01:10:25,192 --> 01:10:26,913
- Hi.
- Hi.

925
01:10:28,431 --> 01:10:31,392
I think he's disappointed that
you don't have a captain's hat on.

926
01:10:31,952 --> 01:10:34,072
That's what he was expecting.
Right?

927
01:10:34,312 --> 01:10:35,632
Come on in.

928
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:46,831
I don't know if it suits
a boy your age, but...

929
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:47,872
It's great.

930
01:10:48,590 --> 01:10:49,871
Thanks.

931
01:10:50,671 --> 01:10:51,871
Sweet, Garret.

932
01:10:57,712 --> 01:10:59,753
He's into this mayhem thing.

933
01:10:59,992 --> 01:11:01,712
I think it's a male deal.

934
01:11:05,872 --> 01:11:07,513
Garret, thank you.

935
01:11:08,231 --> 01:11:10,033
She hates chocolates.

936
01:11:10,352 --> 01:11:11,673
It's really weird.

937
01:11:11,912 --> 01:11:12,712
True?

938
01:11:15,953 --> 01:11:18,514
Yes, but it was very sweet of you.

939
01:11:18,953 --> 01:11:20,273
Jason?
Excuse me.

940
01:11:25,274 --> 01:11:27,234
Thank you.
That's what I really wanted.

941
01:11:36,593 --> 01:11:38,634
You got to be beat, no?

942
01:11:42,074 --> 01:11:43,194
I hope this is okay.

943
01:11:43,434 --> 01:11:45,154
This is fine.

944
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:47,474
I mean, this is perfect.

945
01:11:49,075 --> 01:11:53,034
Tomorrow night, Jason will be at
a friend's house. So....

946
01:11:53,835 --> 01:11:55,873
Meaning what?

947
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:58,312
Shut up.

948
01:11:59,832 --> 01:12:02,393
- I know this isn't very romantic.
- What?

949
01:12:02,633 --> 01:12:03,674
This is my life.

950
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:05,674
No, this is...

951
01:12:05,913 --> 01:12:07,393
...nice.

952
01:12:07,673 --> 01:12:08,794
It's nice.

953
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:11,072
I just want you to know me.

954
01:12:11,673 --> 01:12:14,394
Just the day-to-day, regular me.

955
01:12:16,594 --> 01:12:18,234
You think you know me?

956
01:12:38,715 --> 01:12:39,515
What?

957
01:12:40,194 --> 01:12:41,075
What?

958
01:12:43,395 --> 01:12:44,675
He's not coming.

959
01:12:47,956 --> 01:12:49,515
But I've come so far.

960
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:52,476
Theresa...

961
01:12:56,195 --> 01:12:58,236
I don't even know.

962
01:13:02,236 --> 01:13:03,797
I'm glad you're here.

963
01:13:05,317 --> 01:13:07,114
I'm glad I'm here too.

964
01:13:25,596 --> 01:13:27,075
We're almost there.

965
01:13:39,636 --> 01:13:41,036
Wait. Is that him?

966
01:13:41,596 --> 01:13:42,556
That's him.

967
01:13:45,357 --> 01:13:47,075
Oh, my God.
Don't say a word.

968
01:13:47,396 --> 01:13:48,517
Hey, buddy!

969
01:13:48,756 --> 01:13:49,716
What are you doing here?

970
01:13:51,797 --> 01:13:53,117
Train's pretty cool.

971
01:13:53,356 --> 01:13:54,677
- Can I use the computer?
- Yeah.

972
01:13:55,356 --> 01:13:56,237
Hi.

973
01:13:56,477 --> 01:13:57,436
Hi.

974
01:13:58,396 --> 01:13:59,878
Jason wanted to surprise you.

975
01:14:00,757 --> 01:14:02,077
- Hope it's okay.
- It's fine.

976
01:14:02,358 --> 01:14:05,317
It's only for a minute, then
we'll hop back on that train.

977
01:14:05,558 --> 01:14:06,958
He's scared of it, Mom.

978
01:14:08,758 --> 01:14:10,397
I'm not scared of it.

979
01:14:11,318 --> 01:14:12,198
Hello.

980
01:14:13,438 --> 01:14:15,238
Annie. Garret.

981
01:14:16,398 --> 01:14:17,358
Hi.

982
01:14:17,595 --> 01:14:20,037
This is where I work.

983
01:14:21,755 --> 01:14:23,316
Hi.
Hi.

984
01:14:25,556 --> 01:14:27,036
It was nice meeting you.

985
01:14:34,677 --> 01:14:37,876
Well, now I can
picture you on the job.

986
01:14:42,556 --> 01:14:44,437
So that's him. That's Ahab?

987
01:14:44,798 --> 01:14:46,598
That's him.
He's no Captain Ahab.

988
01:14:46,878 --> 01:14:48,437
Smile at him. Be friendly.

989
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,878
Friendly people.
I know.

990
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:54,037
He's smiling at her.
That's sweet.

991
01:14:54,278 --> 01:14:55,919
Oh, behave!

992
01:14:57,118 --> 01:15:00,558
You're so negative, Charlie.
Don't you want her to be happy?

993
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:04,397
She'll smell of haddock
for the rest of her life.

994
01:15:05,438 --> 01:15:07,238
I don't know what I was expecting.

995
01:15:07,478 --> 01:15:09,278
I mean, I didn't realize...

996
01:15:09,598 --> 01:15:10,718
...everybody's close.

997
01:15:11,879 --> 01:15:14,519
Theresa, this came as
a big surprise to me...

998
01:15:14,758 --> 01:15:18,280
...but apparently it is the poodle
that is the number one dog.

999
01:15:18,878 --> 01:15:20,919
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1000
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,719
- Hi, Lina.
- Hi, Jason.

1001
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:27,959
Jason is taking Garret
into town sailing now.

1002
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:29,118
Really? So soon?

1003
01:15:29,398 --> 01:15:31,198
If he doesn't get lost first.

1004
01:15:31,598 --> 01:15:33,318
I know there's a lake
around here somewhere.

1005
01:15:33,558 --> 01:15:34,597
He senses that.

1006
01:15:34,879 --> 01:15:37,677
Sensitive. If you
get into any trouble at all...

1007
01:15:37,919 --> 01:15:40,717
...certainly give me...
the paper a call.

1008
01:15:42,278 --> 01:15:44,317
You want to steer?
Sure.

1009
01:15:44,558 --> 01:15:45,758
You're the captain.

1010
01:15:46,278 --> 01:15:48,719
You got to keep us going straight.

1011
01:15:49,159 --> 01:15:50,558
Straight ahead.

1012
01:15:58,039 --> 01:15:59,839
Hi.
Hi.

1013
01:16:00,759 --> 01:16:01,720
Here you go.

1014
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,320
How you doing?
Good.

1015
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,080
The gang.
Hi, Lenny.

1016
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,279
Bye, Mom.
Have fun.

1017
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,080
Say bye to your mom.
See you!

1018
01:16:42,759 --> 01:16:44,759
I'm not used to having you here.

1019
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:50,199
It's okay, Garret.

1020
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,080
It's nice...

1021
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,079
...being among your things.

1022
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,840
Well, is it what you expected?

1023
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,720
It's comforting.

1024
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,161
You're making me self-conscious.

1025
01:17:30,041 --> 01:17:31,641
What are you looking at?

1026
01:17:32,441 --> 01:17:34,203
Theresa in her home.

1027
01:17:38,642 --> 01:17:40,522
The regular everyday...

1028
01:17:41,283 --> 01:17:42,602
...Theresa.

1029
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:00,602
Wait.

1030
01:18:02,201 --> 01:18:03,481
I really...

1031
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:05,801
...wanted to make this right.

1032
01:18:07,121 --> 01:18:10,801
I just wanted to straighten up
my room and light a candle and....

1033
01:18:13,642 --> 01:18:15,562
And I need to take a shower.

1034
01:18:23,041 --> 01:18:24,561
Garret, wait.

1035
01:20:03,046 --> 01:20:05,965
One, two, three...

1036
01:20:06,206 --> 01:20:08,965
...four, five, six.

1037
01:20:11,125 --> 01:20:12,645
That was a goodie.
So scared.

1038
01:20:12,886 --> 01:20:14,404
I'm so scared.

1039
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:16,163
That was big.

1040
01:20:18,605 --> 01:20:21,843
I'm going to take a shower. Finally.

1041
01:20:24,924 --> 01:20:26,365
Wait. Just...

1042
01:22:10,327 --> 01:22:12,327
You're not going to believe what...

1043
01:22:17,809 --> 01:22:19,889
Oh, God. Garret.

1044
01:22:20,208 --> 01:22:22,008
Where did you get this?

1045
01:22:25,889 --> 01:22:26,928
I found it.

1046
01:22:27,168 --> 01:22:28,889
What do you mean, you found it?

1047
01:22:29,128 --> 01:22:30,889
I found it on the shore.

1048
01:22:32,288 --> 01:22:33,649
Garret, wait.

1049
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:36,247
It came to me.

1050
01:22:36,688 --> 01:22:38,327
You have to trust me.

1051
01:22:38,767 --> 01:22:39,607
Trust you?

1052
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:44,087
I just had to meet the person
that wrote it. I had to meet you.

1053
01:22:44,407 --> 01:22:46,687
- I was going to tell you before.
- How could you find me?

1054
01:22:46,927 --> 01:22:51,287
Because I tracked all of the messages
and there were clues...

1055
01:22:51,767 --> 01:22:53,567
All of the messages?

1056
01:22:55,728 --> 01:22:58,728
They've all been found and people
saw it in the column and they wrote.

1057
01:22:58,969 --> 01:23:01,449
I swear to God, I was
going to tell you, Garret.

1058
01:23:01,688 --> 01:23:02,609
Garret, wait.

1059
01:23:02,848 --> 01:23:04,288
I got to get out of here.

1060
01:23:09,329 --> 01:23:10,329
Garret, wait!

1061
01:23:10,568 --> 01:23:12,249
Why did you do this?

1062
01:23:13,129 --> 01:23:14,329
Why?!

1063
01:23:16,329 --> 01:23:18,050
Were you curious?

1064
01:23:19,130 --> 01:23:22,089
It's goddamn research!
I'm falling in love with you!

1065
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,969
First in the letters
and then when I met you!

1066
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:27,129
And I'm sorry! I was afraid!

1067
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:30,050
I was afraid if I told you
that I would push you away!

1068
01:23:30,289 --> 01:23:31,890
Just like I'm doing now.

1069
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:34,489
Wait!

1070
01:23:34,731 --> 01:23:36,009
No matter what you think of me...

1071
01:23:36,251 --> 01:23:37,929
...and no matter what happens now,
I want you to know...

1072
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:39,451
...how much I care for you.

1073
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:41,971
And it shouldn't matter...

1074
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:44,611
...what brought us together, Garret.

1075
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:47,729
I sent those letters into the sea
to her. Not to you!

1076
01:23:48,169 --> 01:23:49,609
Not to all your friends at work!

1077
01:23:49,848 --> 01:23:50,809
I know.

1078
01:23:51,048 --> 01:23:52,930
They all knew about me, didn't they?

1079
01:23:53,648 --> 01:23:55,088
All about Catherine?

1080
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:58,808
My life was changed
by those three letters.

1081
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:01,049
- I didn't want it printed in the paper.
- Two letters.

1082
01:24:01,289 --> 01:24:04,090
- You've got to believe me.
- I sent two letters to Catherine.

1083
01:24:06,329 --> 01:24:07,370
What?

1084
01:24:07,970 --> 01:24:10,689
I have all of the letters.
I have all three.

1085
01:24:13,289 --> 01:24:14,809
Where's the third letter?

1086
01:24:16,329 --> 01:24:17,970
Is it in that drawer?

1087
01:24:26,611 --> 01:24:27,890
Catherine?

1088
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:31,891
Catherine?

1089
01:24:52,932 --> 01:24:54,932
To all the ships at sea...

1090
01:24:55,212 --> 01:24:57,252
...and all the ports of call.

1091
01:24:57,491 --> 01:24:58,810
To my family...

1092
01:24:59,050 --> 01:25:01,251
...and to all friends and strangers.

1093
01:25:01,891 --> 01:25:04,851
This is a message and a prayer.

1094
01:25:05,531 --> 01:25:09,091
The message is that my travels
taught me a great truth.

1095
01:25:10,811 --> 01:25:13,251
I already had what everyone
is searching for...

1096
01:25:13,490 --> 01:25:15,170
...and few ever find:

1097
01:25:15,811 --> 01:25:17,611
The one person in the world...

1098
01:25:17,851 --> 01:25:20,331
...who I was born to love forever.

1099
01:25:20,931 --> 01:25:24,572
A person like me, of the Outer Banks...

1100
01:25:24,811 --> 01:25:26,972
...and the blue Atlantic mystery.

1101
01:25:29,131 --> 01:25:31,692
A person rich in simple treasures...

1102
01:25:31,932 --> 01:25:34,812
...self-made, self-taught.

1103
01:25:36,492 --> 01:25:39,132
A harbor where I am forever home.

1104
01:25:39,371 --> 01:25:42,092
And no wind or trouble...

1105
01:25:42,532 --> 01:25:46,373
...or even a little death
can knock down this house.

1106
01:25:48,893 --> 01:25:53,814
The prayer is that everyone in the
world can know this kind of love...

1107
01:25:54,013 --> 01:25:56,093
...and be healed by it.

1108
01:25:56,453 --> 01:26:01,093
If my prayer is heard, then there
will be an erasing of all guilt...

1109
01:26:01,334 --> 01:26:03,294
...and all regret...

1110
01:26:03,574 --> 01:26:06,174
...and an end to all anger.

1111
01:26:07,053 --> 01:26:08,493
Please, God.

1112
01:26:09,413 --> 01:26:10,652
Amen.

1113
01:26:21,371 --> 01:26:23,492
I never knew what she wrote.

1114
01:26:26,172 --> 01:26:27,493
She...

1115
01:26:28,092 --> 01:26:30,172
...never came back from that day.

1116
01:26:32,932 --> 01:26:35,814
I dried her.
I tried to keep her warm.

1117
01:26:36,774 --> 01:26:38,693
Took her to the hospital.

1118
01:26:39,813 --> 01:26:41,254
She never....

1119
01:26:45,574 --> 01:26:48,014
She died three days later.

1120
01:26:50,534 --> 01:26:53,013
I keep thinking if she hadn't
gone out that day...

1121
01:26:53,254 --> 01:26:54,774
Garret, she knew.

1122
01:26:57,974 --> 01:26:59,494
She said it.

1123
01:27:00,695 --> 01:27:04,454
"Not even a little death can
knock down this house." She knew.

1124
01:27:10,214 --> 01:27:11,655
I want to...

1125
01:27:11,975 --> 01:27:13,455
...keep this.

1126
01:28:19,216 --> 01:28:21,137
Hi.
Hi.

1127
01:28:21,657 --> 01:28:24,536
I'm sorry.
Would you rather be alone?

1128
01:28:31,018 --> 01:28:32,536
Has he called?

1129
01:28:33,616 --> 01:28:34,535
No.

1130
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:37,455
I left him a message, though.

1131
01:28:39,455 --> 01:28:41,215
I said I was sorry.

1132
01:28:42,376 --> 01:28:44,296
And I asked him to call.

1133
01:28:45,816 --> 01:28:47,616
Well, then, he will.

1134
01:28:50,416 --> 01:28:52,176
Lina, do you remember...

1135
01:28:53,056 --> 01:28:55,495
...what I was always complaining about?

1136
01:28:56,297 --> 01:28:58,697
All those times you let me cry
on your shoulder about David.

1137
01:28:58,937 --> 01:29:00,136
Remember?

1138
01:29:01,296 --> 01:29:03,776
Honesty. Trust.

1139
01:29:08,257 --> 01:29:10,057
I was so scared.

1140
01:29:11,656 --> 01:29:12,857
I don't....

1141
01:29:13,897 --> 01:29:16,697
I was falling in love
with Garret and I....

1142
01:29:18,257 --> 01:29:19,897
Half of my mind was saying,
"Tell him"...

1143
01:29:20,137 --> 01:29:22,097
...and the other half was saying:

1144
01:29:24,378 --> 01:29:27,137
"Just wait. He's not
going to understand.

1145
01:29:27,499 --> 01:29:28,579
Wait till the right moment.

1146
01:29:28,818 --> 01:29:31,418
Just wait till you have the
right words." You know?

1147
01:29:32,538 --> 01:29:34,819
And I blew it. I just...

1148
01:29:35,058 --> 01:29:37,658
...killed it by being what I hate:

1149
01:29:37,899 --> 01:29:38,859
A liar.

1150
01:29:39,098 --> 01:29:40,618
You're not a liar.

1151
01:29:41,698 --> 01:29:43,539
But to him I am.

1152
01:29:45,456 --> 01:29:48,457
And I don't think he's ever
going to be able to trust me now.

1153
01:29:48,936 --> 01:29:51,418
Don't you understand we all
have our own little lies...

1154
01:29:51,657 --> 01:29:54,257
...and our little unspoken truths?

1155
01:29:54,497 --> 01:29:58,297
And you just have to have a little
faith that he'll understand that.

1156
01:30:00,377 --> 01:30:01,818
I don't know.

1157
01:30:03,818 --> 01:30:05,737
I don't know if he can.

1158
01:30:08,257 --> 01:30:12,778
I saw his pain. He was holding her
letter and he was reading it.

1159
01:30:13,058 --> 01:30:14,779
And there was just...

1160
01:30:16,418 --> 01:30:18,698
...so much pain and....

1161
01:30:19,658 --> 01:30:22,338
He has so much love for her,
you know?

1162
01:30:25,218 --> 01:30:26,458
I don't know.

1163
01:31:03,618 --> 01:31:04,858
Marta?

1164
01:31:13,659 --> 01:31:15,018
Marta!

1165
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:55,060
Yeah.

1166
01:31:55,381 --> 01:31:59,100
You said if I was ever thinking about
writing a piece for the paper....

1167
01:32:00,422 --> 01:32:01,341
No kidding.

1168
01:32:04,421 --> 01:32:05,861
Is he in here?

1169
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:07,340
No.

1170
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:09,539
Other stories.

1171
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:11,220
Good stories.

1172
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:13,340
It's about time.

1173
01:32:15,501 --> 01:32:17,740
People get hurt, they shut down.

1174
01:32:18,421 --> 01:32:20,181
Till the pain goes away?

1175
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:22,701
I don't know.

1176
01:32:23,381 --> 01:32:27,220
Maybe you just learn to take it in
like everything else.

1177
01:32:28,541 --> 01:32:31,421
Kind of like a few pieces of cork
in a great glass of wine.

1178
01:32:31,661 --> 01:32:33,340
You don't want to miss the wine.

1179
01:32:34,541 --> 01:32:36,541
Is that in here?

1180
01:32:36,782 --> 01:32:38,822
The cork in the wine thing?

1181
01:32:39,781 --> 01:32:40,582
No.

1182
01:32:40,822 --> 01:32:42,862
Good. I hate it.

1183
01:32:49,142 --> 01:32:52,582
It may be that most of us
write our own life story...

1184
01:32:52,822 --> 01:32:54,822
...making it up as we go along.

1185
01:32:55,701 --> 01:32:59,703
But others seem to have lives
that are already shaped and planned...

1186
01:33:00,302 --> 01:33:01,943
...inescapable...

1187
01:33:02,303 --> 01:33:04,542
...perfect as a circle.

1188
01:35:01,464 --> 01:35:02,745
Okay.

1189
01:35:04,226 --> 01:35:05,504
Open it.

1190
01:35:06,705 --> 01:35:08,065
Slowly.

1191
01:35:13,185 --> 01:35:15,105
- This is exciting.
- It is.

1192
01:35:20,985 --> 01:35:22,666
Front page of the section!
Great!

1193
01:35:23,546 --> 01:35:24,426
Thanks, bud.

1194
01:35:24,666 --> 01:35:25,826
Can I cut it out?

1195
01:35:26,306 --> 01:35:27,225
Sure.

1196
01:35:28,946 --> 01:35:30,866
Is this okay?
That is great.

1197
01:35:31,106 --> 01:35:33,066
That's perfect. Thank you.

1198
01:35:40,424 --> 01:35:41,465
Here's your mail, ma'am.

1199
01:35:41,704 --> 01:35:42,504
Thank you.

1200
01:35:42,745 --> 01:35:43,625
Sure.

1201
01:36:14,786 --> 01:36:16,267
Nice.

1202
01:36:16,866 --> 01:36:18,826
I love what you've done here.

1203
01:36:19,786 --> 01:36:21,787
- Very minimalist.
- Very nice of you to stop by, sir.

1204
01:36:22,027 --> 01:36:26,067
Yes, well, I come bearing a gift
for your new phone booth office.

1205
01:36:26,306 --> 01:36:27,907
- Can I hang it?
- That is so sweet.

1206
01:36:28,147 --> 01:36:29,587
I know.

1207
01:36:36,387 --> 01:36:38,267
You'll never guess who it is.

1208
01:36:43,147 --> 01:36:44,508
You seem happy.

1209
01:36:44,748 --> 01:36:46,708
Is anything all right?

1210
01:36:50,468 --> 01:36:51,866
Ahab.

1211
01:36:53,427 --> 01:36:54,507
May I?

1212
01:36:58,547 --> 01:37:01,547
If you decide to go do something
wild and ridiculous...

1213
01:37:01,786 --> 01:37:03,507
...it'll only prove one thing.

1214
01:37:03,746 --> 01:37:05,307
And what's that?

1215
01:37:07,188 --> 01:37:10,267
He's one lucky old son of the sea.

1216
01:37:15,666 --> 01:37:17,907
That's a Charlie Toschi quote.

1217
01:37:33,908 --> 01:37:37,428
You know, somebody's going to think
you're drying your skivvies up there.

1218
01:37:41,508 --> 01:37:42,909
You look nice.

1219
01:37:43,148 --> 01:37:45,069
Yeah, well, it hurts.

1220
01:38:12,308 --> 01:38:14,268
She's beautiful, Garret.

1221
01:38:15,428 --> 01:38:16,788
Thanks, Marta.

1222
01:38:18,708 --> 01:38:20,189
Go get them!

1223
01:38:25,749 --> 01:38:26,909
Nice job, Garret.

1224
01:38:54,709 --> 01:38:56,110
To Catherine.

1225
01:38:56,350 --> 01:38:57,471
To Catherine.

1226
01:38:58,630 --> 01:38:59,671
Wish to God...

1227
01:39:03,550 --> 01:39:05,471
Wish to God she was here today.

1228
01:39:10,712 --> 01:39:12,151
Every day.

1229
01:40:51,192 --> 01:40:53,313
My dad said you were there.

1230
01:40:53,712 --> 01:40:55,153
Wish I'd have known.

1231
01:40:56,473 --> 01:40:58,873
A surprise. Dumb idea.

1232
01:40:59,113 --> 01:41:00,393
No, it's....

1233
01:41:01,273 --> 01:41:02,872
It's great to see you.

1234
01:41:05,273 --> 01:41:07,394
- Glad you came.
- Me too.

1235
01:41:08,474 --> 01:41:11,074
I saw the boat. It's beautiful.

1236
01:41:11,313 --> 01:41:12,634
It's great.

1237
01:41:13,553 --> 01:41:15,154
I'm happy for you.

1238
01:41:15,833 --> 01:41:17,634
You want to come inside?

1239
01:41:23,354 --> 01:41:24,554
Theresa...

1240
01:41:37,913 --> 01:41:39,312
I'm sorry.

1241
01:41:40,792 --> 01:41:42,833
What I said must've hurt you.

1242
01:41:44,753 --> 01:41:45,952
No.

1243
01:41:47,673 --> 01:41:50,474
I just heard what
you couldn't tell me.

1244
01:41:52,353 --> 01:41:54,473
Or maybe what I couldn't hear.

1245
01:41:54,873 --> 01:41:56,953
And I understand now.

1246
01:41:58,073 --> 01:42:00,514
I think it's so beautiful
the way you love her.

1247
01:42:00,754 --> 01:42:02,754
No, you don't have to say anything.

1248
01:42:03,314 --> 01:42:05,914
It's what made me want to find you.

1249
01:42:11,195 --> 01:42:12,394
Then stay with me.

1250
01:42:12,635 --> 01:42:13,795
Come inside.

1251
01:42:14,074 --> 01:42:15,795
Just stay as long as you want.

1252
01:42:16,034 --> 01:42:19,594
I thought about it. I thought about
a lot of things sitting out here.

1253
01:42:20,595 --> 01:42:21,714
And I can't stay.

1254
01:42:22,035 --> 01:42:23,076
Why?

1255
01:42:23,315 --> 01:42:24,995
Because if you can,
you'll come to me...

1256
01:42:25,235 --> 01:42:28,756
...when it's right.
And if it's not right, it's okay.

1257
01:42:29,836 --> 01:42:31,435
Because I wouldn't...

1258
01:42:32,036 --> 01:42:33,755
...regret one minute.

1259
01:42:35,076 --> 01:42:36,035
Not one.

1260
01:42:39,236 --> 01:42:40,436
Bye.

1261
01:42:45,757 --> 01:42:46,676
Theresa....

1262
01:42:50,114 --> 01:42:52,034
I don't want to lose you.

1263
01:42:55,035 --> 01:42:56,355
Then don't.

1264
01:43:13,396 --> 01:43:16,116
Why do you always sit
in the same place?

1265
01:43:16,355 --> 01:43:17,836
What the hell you care where I sit?

1266
01:43:18,076 --> 01:43:21,676
I'm curious. You started
sitting here 10, 11 years ago.

1267
01:43:21,915 --> 01:43:22,915
For chrissake!

1268
01:43:23,155 --> 01:43:24,957
You used to sit over there.

1269
01:43:35,397 --> 01:43:37,236
- Okay?
- Okay.

1270
01:43:41,037 --> 01:43:43,038
Get the boy a cup of coffee.

1271
01:43:49,598 --> 01:43:51,118
You look like hell.

1272
01:43:53,438 --> 01:43:54,718
I'm okay.

1273
01:43:55,677 --> 01:43:57,318
Catch up to her?

1274
01:44:01,835 --> 01:44:03,036
You let her go.

1275
01:44:04,356 --> 01:44:05,876
I don't want to talk about it.

1276
01:44:06,116 --> 01:44:07,436
Listen, I was...
Go away.

1277
01:44:14,557 --> 01:44:16,197
She made up her mind.

1278
01:44:16,596 --> 01:44:18,597
- The hell you want?
- Persistence.

1279
01:44:18,837 --> 01:44:21,557
Get crazy. Go nuts.
A fight, for chrissake.

1280
01:44:21,837 --> 01:44:23,477
You spent one afternoon with her.

1281
01:44:24,676 --> 01:44:26,756
You don't even know who she is.

1282
01:44:28,958 --> 01:44:29,758
What's...?

1283
01:44:29,997 --> 01:44:31,437
Chicago.

1284
01:44:31,917 --> 01:44:33,958
Three minutes. Get on the phone.

1285
01:44:37,678 --> 01:44:39,558
It's your last chance.

1286
01:44:49,557 --> 01:44:51,358
Of course she walked away.

1287
01:44:51,678 --> 01:44:53,079
She ain't stupid.

1288
01:44:54,959 --> 01:44:56,398
Think she wants to try
to come between you and...

1289
01:44:56,638 --> 01:44:59,038
I don't have it figured out.
Who the hell does?

1290
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:02,239
Think it's easy for me to see
another woman in your house?

1291
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:03,919
Well, it ain't easy.

1292
01:45:04,479 --> 01:45:06,159
I'll tell you one thing...

1293
01:45:06,439 --> 01:45:08,560
...I'd give a million bucks
to see you grab her...

1294
01:45:08,799 --> 01:45:10,238
...and figure it out as you go along.

1295
01:45:10,477 --> 01:45:11,278
Just drop it!

1296
01:45:11,477 --> 01:45:12,758
- Drop it?
- Yeah. Drop it!

1297
01:45:12,997 --> 01:45:14,118
Just...

1298
01:45:17,318 --> 01:45:18,637
...forget about it.

1299
01:45:19,478 --> 01:45:20,478
I can't!

1300
01:45:25,159 --> 01:45:26,478
I can't forget about it.

1301
01:45:27,799 --> 01:45:29,238
Why the hell not?

1302
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:32,318
Because you're my boy.

1303
01:45:34,879 --> 01:45:36,758
- It's not your business.
- What?

1304
01:45:36,998 --> 01:45:39,639
I said it's not your business!

1305
01:45:40,519 --> 01:45:42,558
Turn around. Hey!

1306
01:45:43,319 --> 01:45:44,799
Turn around.

1307
01:45:46,158 --> 01:45:47,719
Make a fist.

1308
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:49,359
Make it!

1309
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,440
Now you hit me!

1310
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:54,080
Hit me in the face,
you son of a bitch.

1311
01:45:57,120 --> 01:45:58,480
Not my business?

1312
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:00,960
My son is not my business?

1313
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:03,719
What the hell else have I got...

1314
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:06,879
...that's close to me?

1315
01:46:07,841 --> 01:46:09,280
Who else ever...

1316
01:46:10,401 --> 01:46:11,961
...stuck up for me?

1317
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:14,001
Think I don't know your pain?
I do.

1318
01:46:14,881 --> 01:46:18,280
Some of it I put there.
Think I can forget that?

1319
01:46:20,601 --> 01:46:22,959
When she went to New York,
you could've gone with her...

1320
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:25,679
...and here I was, sick,
drunk, flat on my ass...

1321
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,519
...bringing you down.

1322
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:32,199
- Maybe it could've been different.
- Dad!

1323
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:37,759
I didn't stay for you.

1324
01:46:39,279 --> 01:46:40,599
This is who I am.

1325
01:46:40,961 --> 01:46:43,400
This place.
This is where I belong.

1326
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:47,120
She came back because she found out
she belonged here too.

1327
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:49,520
She chose for herself.

1328
01:46:51,921 --> 01:46:53,921
God, I loved her for that.

1329
01:46:55,961 --> 01:46:57,601
So did I.

1330
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:01,761
Now you choose. Choose...

1331
01:47:02,001 --> 01:47:05,442
...between yesterday and tomorrow.
Pick one.

1332
01:47:06,521 --> 01:47:07,841
Stick with it.

1333
01:47:08,442 --> 01:47:10,122
And I will shut up...

1334
01:47:10,681 --> 01:47:12,482
...and leave you alone.

1335
01:47:43,841 --> 01:47:46,722
"So you'll always know where you are...

1336
01:47:47,081 --> 01:47:48,922
...and where home is.

1337
01:47:51,002 --> 01:47:52,642
Love, Theresa."

1338
01:48:49,163 --> 01:48:50,123
Hey!

1339
01:48:51,523 --> 01:48:53,603
You heading for blue water?

1340
01:48:54,562 --> 01:48:55,602
Yes, sir.

1341
01:48:56,963 --> 01:48:59,003
Well, you know what you're doing.

1342
01:49:00,163 --> 01:49:02,323
Got it all figured out.

1343
01:50:08,364 --> 01:50:09,244
Hey, bud.

1344
01:50:10,125 --> 01:50:11,284
Time to get up.

1345
01:50:13,924 --> 01:50:15,405
Another day.

1346
01:54:02,011 --> 01:54:05,090
They call him the Mayor of 43rd.

1347
01:54:05,330 --> 01:54:08,890
He's so sweet. He knows everyone.
Helps people.

1348
01:54:09,450 --> 01:54:12,411
The point is, it's his
seventieth birthday.

1349
01:54:13,331 --> 01:54:16,090
Theresa, there's a phone call
for you.

1350
01:54:16,331 --> 01:54:17,491
Can you take a message?

1351
01:54:17,770 --> 01:54:18,891
It's urgent.

1352
01:54:21,172 --> 01:54:22,491
Excuse me.

1353
01:54:22,732 --> 01:54:24,332
You better take it in my office.

1354
01:54:24,571 --> 01:54:26,011
Is it Jase?

1355
01:54:29,972 --> 01:54:30,932
Hello?

1356
01:54:31,572 --> 01:54:32,852
Hey, girl.

1357
01:54:33,891 --> 01:54:35,052
Dodge?

1358
01:54:35,572 --> 01:54:37,172
I better...

1359
01:54:38,132 --> 01:54:41,850
...get this said
while I can still talk.

1360
01:54:42,891 --> 01:54:46,450
There was a boat, Theresa,
offshore in trouble.

1361
01:54:46,730 --> 01:54:48,451
A family, there was three of them.

1362
01:54:48,691 --> 01:54:50,251
Garret tried...

1363
01:54:51,331 --> 01:54:53,931
Well, he tried to help, and...

1364
01:54:55,531 --> 01:54:58,210
It's bad. He went down.

1365
01:55:00,210 --> 01:55:01,491
What do you mean?

1366
01:55:01,771 --> 01:55:03,092
He went in after them.

1367
01:55:03,331 --> 01:55:06,931
He got two of them.
But he went down, Theresa.

1368
01:55:08,092 --> 01:55:09,932
I am so sorry.

1369
01:55:12,691 --> 01:55:14,572
That's all I got now.

1370
01:55:16,372 --> 01:55:17,652
Bye.

1371
01:55:18,892 --> 01:55:19,853
Okay.

1372
01:55:22,813 --> 01:55:24,532
Oh, my God.

1373
01:57:19,014 --> 01:57:20,054
Hey.

1374
01:57:24,895 --> 01:57:26,455
Hard times.

1375
01:57:26,814 --> 01:57:28,255
Come on in.

1376
01:57:36,015 --> 01:57:37,695
I found it on the boat.

1377
01:57:38,335 --> 01:57:39,936
It was in his slicker.

1378
01:58:02,896 --> 01:58:04,376
Dear Catherine:

1379
01:58:04,896 --> 01:58:06,616
My life began when I found you...

1380
01:58:06,857 --> 01:58:09,776
...and I thought it had ended
when I failed to save you.

1381
01:58:10,216 --> 01:58:14,295
I thought that hanging on to your
memory was keeping us both alive.

1382
01:58:14,535 --> 01:58:15,855
But I was wrong.

1383
01:58:16,256 --> 01:58:18,055
A woman named Theresa
showed me that...

1384
01:58:18,295 --> 01:58:20,615
...if I was brave enough to
open my heart...

1385
01:58:20,856 --> 01:58:23,936
...I could love again,
no matter how terrible my grief.

1386
01:58:24,255 --> 01:58:27,215
She made me realize
I was only half-alive.

1387
01:58:27,455 --> 01:58:29,576
It scared me and it hurt.

1388
01:58:29,815 --> 01:58:34,336
I didn't know how much I needed her
till the night she flew away.

1389
01:58:35,615 --> 01:58:39,536
When that airplane took off, I felt
something inside me tear away.

1390
01:58:39,856 --> 01:58:40,976
And I knew.

1391
01:58:41,216 --> 01:58:42,657
I should have stopped her.

1392
01:58:42,896 --> 01:58:44,896
I should've followed her home.

1393
01:58:45,376 --> 01:58:47,936
And now tomorrow, I'm going to sail
to the windy point...

1394
01:58:48,217 --> 01:58:50,457
...and I'm going to say goodbye to you.

1395
01:58:51,457 --> 01:58:53,337
Then I'm going to go to this woman...

1396
01:58:53,578 --> 01:58:55,897
...and see if I can win her heart.

1397
02:00:04,418 --> 02:00:06,338
If I can, I know you'll bless me.

1398
02:00:06,579 --> 02:00:08,018
And bless us all.

1399
02:00:08,820 --> 02:00:09,899
If I can't...

1400
02:00:10,139 --> 02:00:12,779
...then I'm still blessed because
I've had the privilege of loving...

1401
02:00:13,018 --> 02:00:14,658
...twice in my life.

1402
02:00:15,098 --> 02:00:16,419
She gave me that.

1403
02:00:16,658 --> 02:00:20,019
And if I tell you I love her
as much as I loved you...

1404
02:00:20,299 --> 02:00:22,300
...then you'll know the whole story.

1405
02:00:24,380 --> 02:00:26,380
Rest in peace, my love.

1406
02:00:26,620 --> 02:00:27,619
Garret.

1407
02:00:55,420 --> 02:00:58,299
If some lives form a perfect circle...

1408
02:00:58,979 --> 02:01:03,900
...others take shape in ways we cannot
predict or always understand.

1409
02:01:04,860 --> 02:01:07,699
Loss has been a part of my journey.

1410
02:01:08,099 --> 02:01:11,299
But it has also shown me
what is precious.

1411
02:01:11,900 --> 02:01:16,100
So has a love for which
I can only be grateful.
