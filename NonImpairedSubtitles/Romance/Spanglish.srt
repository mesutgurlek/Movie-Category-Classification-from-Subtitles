00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,555
<i>To Dean of Admissions,
Princeton University.</i>

2
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,658
<i>The most influential person in my life...</i>

3
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:39,136
<i>... is Mother Teresa, whose example
helped me overcome the arrogance...</i>

4
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:43,232
<i>which threatened after my 1,600 SAT score
and National Merit Scholarship.</i>

5
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:46,540
<i>My influential person taught me
the most important word I've learned.</i>

6
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,444
<i>Aloha, which I...</i>

7
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:55,753
<i>To the Dean of Admissions,
Princeton University...</i>

8
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,284
<i>from Cristina Moreno.</i>

9
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:03,958
<i>Most influential person: My mother.
No contest.</i>

10
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:09,192
<i>I think I have been pointing
toward this essay...</i>

11
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,933
<i>ever since the day, 12 years ago in Mexico,
when my father left.</i>

12
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:22,145
<i>Such was my mother's need to protect me...</i>

13
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,344
<i>that she would not let me see her cry.</i>

14
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,015
<i>The trick was...</i>

15
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,685
<i>get over it as quickly
and privately as possible.</i>

16
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,600
<i>Such was my need to protect her...</i>

17
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,670
<i>that I never let on that I could hear her.</i>

18
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:08,084
<i>My mother kept us in Mexico
as long as possible...</i>

19
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,153
<i>to root me in all things Latin.</i>

20
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:15,725
<i>Finally, she sensed
our last opportunity for change.</i>

21
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,061
<i>We would leave for America.</i>

22
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,470
<i>"One tear."</i>

23
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,741
<i>"Just one."</i>

24
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:29,472
<i>"So make it a good one," she said.</i>

25
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,494
<i>She would be my Mexico.</i>

26
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,861
<i>Because this admissions essay
is open record...</i>

27
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:58,305
<i>let me just say that our transportation
into the United States was...</i>

28
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,335
<i>economy class.</i>

29
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,311
<i>In order to raise me properly...</i>

30
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,083
<i>my mother needed as much of the security
of her own culture as possible.</i>

31
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,115
<i>So we rolled through Texas...</i>

32
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,921
<i>just 34% Hispanic...</i>

33
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,364
<i>to Los Angeles...</i>

34
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,133
<i>48% Hispanic.</i>

35
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,899
...look at the Detroit Pistons.

36
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,873
And your mother's saying, "Get up!"
But, no, what of it?

37
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,467
You can't see them. Why?
'Cause you're being killed...

38
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,069
you're being strangled
by the psychotic Raider fans.

39
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:37,674
What do you have in Oakland?
You got a bunch of psychotic...

40
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,810
<i>A few minutes adrift
in an alien environment...</i>

41
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:45,891
<i>then we turned a corner,
and we were right back home.</i>

42
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,470
<i>My mother's favorite cousin,
Monica, gave us shelter.</i>

43
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,376
<i>For the next six years...</i>

44
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,777
<i>neither of us ventured outside
our new community.</i>

45
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:13,618
<i>Mom worked two jobs,
paying a total of $450 a week...</i>

46
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:20,290
<i>each of us doing everything we could
to make things work.</i>

47
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,994
<i>We were safe and happy.</i>

48
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,737
<i>If only I could have stayed six.</i>

49
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,006
<i>But I was blossoming.</i>

50
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,340
<i>And during my very first dance...</i>

51
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,441
<i>in the time it took a boy's hand...</i>

52
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:48,248
<i>to go from my back to my bottom...</i>

53
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,988
<i>it was evident that
she would have to leave her night job...</i>

54
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,185
<i>to keep a watchful eye on me.</i>

55
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:58,959
<i>Within days, she was
on her way to a job interview.</i>

56
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,430
<i>She needed $450 from one job.</i>

57
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:07,766
<i>And that meant,
after all her time in America...</i>

58
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:12,168
<i>finally entering a foreign land.</i>

59
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,310
<i>Hello?</i>

60
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:24,214
Yeah, hi. We're here for
the interview with Mrs. Clasky?

61
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,622
<i>Oh, great. You made it.</i>

62
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,956
<i>Come on in. The front door's open
and we're out back. Okay?</i>

63
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,793
<i>And call me Deborah.</i>

64
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,673
<i>Holding out had helped though.</i>

65
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,845
<i>She was no longer intimidated.</i>

66
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,613
<i>Working for Anglos
now posed no problems.</i>

67
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,916
<i>It would just be a job.</i>

68
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,956
<i>White America beckoned.</i>

69
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,757
<i>She stepped across the cultural divide.</i>

70
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,302
Gee whiz in heaven, are you okay?

71
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,341
No. Don't worry, I'm not mad.

72
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:19,902
I've been looking for decoration to put up
on the glass so people wouldn't walk into it.

73
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,471
Instead of taking what was in stock,
which was awful, I special ordered...

74
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,518
but I'll design something myself,
which I should've done...

75
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,884
What does that matter
when your nose is bleeding?

76
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,321
- Shut up, Deborah.
- Now you got it, Mom.

77
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,720
- There's no ice pack, Bern!
- So get anything frozen.

78
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,095
Pressure! Just pressure!

79
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,332
Take this.

80
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:57,342
Is it strange that I just gave you money?
I just felt really badly.

81
00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,615
It's okay.

82
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,354
Chum, knock it off!

83
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,187
I'm sorry about the way the place looks.

84
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,096
I'm hosting a fundraiser
for the school tonight.

85
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,657
It's just a mess. Come sit right here.

86
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,130
Here you go.

87
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,601
Yeah, just... That's great.

88
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,732
Just toss it.

89
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,141
She's my cousin.

90
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,982
She's been here for a while and
she understands some, but doesn't really...

91
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,920
speak English, but, anyway...

92
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,253
She lives in the apartment I manage and...

93
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,759
- So who am I interviewing?
- Her.

94
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,221
You're gorgeous.

95
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,239
She didn't mean it as a compliment.
It's more of an accusation.

96
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,208
- Mother!
- Go ahead.

97
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,208
I'm sorry. This is my daughter, Bernie...

98
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,478
- and my mother, Evelyn Wright.
- Evelyn.

99
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:12,347
- Do you want to come in out of the sun?
- No, we're fine.

100
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,893
You need some sunscreen? I got a 70 here.

101
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,123
She loves the sun.

102
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,132
Look, we're wearing the same sweater.
That's good booga-booga.

103
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,361
You want some lemonade, maybe?

104
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:28,136
Lemonade, please?
Would you like to take some? Both of you?

105
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,136
Okay, let's just talk.

106
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:39,308
I have two children. My husband is
a top chef. Like that makes me something.

107
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:43,082
- Anyway, he works nights, so...
- Do you work?

108
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,919
Yes. No. Not right now. Why?
How do you know to ask that?

109
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,017
It's okay. I can talk about it. I just...

110
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,688
I ran a commercial design company
until four months ago...

111
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:51,923
when it was downsized to zip.

112
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,933
- Now I'm a full-time mom. Gulp!
- Double gulp.

113
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:59,062
I have two children.
My son Georgie is nine, Bernie you know...

114
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,766
and I like the house to be like me,
you know...

115
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:05,333
I'm very loose and meticulous
at the same time.

116
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,743
It's all about first names
and closeness here.

117
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,646
Let her know, absolutely.
But I do care about the place.

118
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,617
I'm so sorry,
I'm not leaving you time to translate.

119
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,590
What's your name?

120
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,393
<i>Llamo. It's one of my five Spanish words.</i>

121
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,156
Flor Moreno.

122
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,028
Floor?

123
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,229
Flor.

124
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,830
- Floor?
- No, Flor.

125
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,305
Floor.

126
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,842
Flor.

127
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,010
- It means "flower," right?
- Flower, yes.

128
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:47,213
- Floor! What I walk on, right?
- Flor.

129
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,787
- Flor.
- Flor!

130
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,714
Is there some school of the ear
I'm flunking out off right now?

131
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,474
What'd she say?

132
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,445
She says if you curl your tongue,
then let it be loose, you'll get it...

133
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,708
and that it's really hard for Americans...

134
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,445
and that it's great you try so hard.
Because most people wouldn't bother.

135
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,620
She gets me.

136
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,053
Flor.

137
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,369
Dense, but stubborn, right?

138
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:43,367
Now, see what you just did for me?
That is just what the kids need.

139
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,672
Patience and encouragement.

140
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,114
All right, money.

141
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:52,309
- Goodbye. Look forward to seeing you.
- Love you.

142
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:56,321
The job is six days a week.
Seven, eight, 12 hours, it depends.

143
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,414
All the housekeeping, driving the kids.

144
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,322
How much a week do you want?

145
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,293
- Whatever you say.
- No!

146
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,525
No. This is a very important question...

147
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,127
because if you ask for too little,
it means you don't value yourself.

148
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:14,570
You ask for too much,
it means you're taking advantage. So?

149
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,471
$1,000.

150
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,117
She's kidding!

151
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,051
$650!

152
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,725
Welcome to the family.

153
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,036
Come on. I want to show you around.

154
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,705
Come on!

155
00:11:56,148 --> 00:12:00,278
<i>I had never known that my mother
had been chronically worried about money...</i>

156
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:05,051
<i>until the first glimpse of her
as financially unburdened.</i>

157
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,620
Can we have a table for two, please?

158
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,858
- We're celebrating.
- Okay, right this way.

159
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,134
Is this good?

160
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,440
<i>- Gracias.
- You're welcome.</i>

161
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,075
Here you go.

162
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,543
Enjoy.

163
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,348
<i>- Gracias.
- You're welcome.</i>

164
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,120
Whoa, expensive.

165
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,158
Excuse me.

166
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,898
Those men would like to buy you a drink.

167
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:04,980
Thank you.

168
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,816
<i>- No, gracias.
- Okay.</i>

169
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:14,752
Sorry.

170
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,770
This is so embarrassing.

171
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,877
My mother said to tell them,
"Who do you think you are?

172
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,918
"Can't you see I'm with my daughter,
for God's sake?"

173
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,478
Good.

174
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,421
She said, "Who do you think you are?"

175
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,930
She's with her daughter, for God's sake.
Her young daughter.

176
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,405
Passing on the left!

177
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,273
Left!

178
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,050
Morning, Flor. See you up there.

179
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,077
Hey! Will you try this?

180
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,913
Isn't that good?

181
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,293
Okay, think seriously about getting up.

182
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,596
You don't have to get up yet,
but are you thinking seriously about it?

183
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:03,999
- Yes.
- Okay.

184
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,976
My God. This is amazing!

185
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,943
A simple "it's good" will do.

186
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,771
I'm glad you like it.

187
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,883
But you could do without this.

188
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:26,984
No!

189
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:32,854
Flor, never do fetch to Chum! Never!

190
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:38,297
I'm not mad. I'm thinking of you.

191
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,628
This is me being nice.

192
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,866
Okay. It's just...

193
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,674
no taking the ball from the dog.
Just don't. No fetch.

194
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,274
No. Never do fetch with this dog.
Okay? Never.

195
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:57,278
Here, can you make us
some coffee, maybe? Yeah?

196
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,847
Okay. Right. Thank you.

197
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:13,137
- Now?
- Yes, actual up.

198
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:16,933
Hey, Dad!

199
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,674
Are you as mad at me as Mom
'cause of what happened?

200
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,485
No, Georgie, I'm not.

201
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,751
Are you mad at me?

202
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,454
- No.
- Good.

203
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,295
Let's hope.

204
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:43,927
When it comes to the kids, John,
we got to stay on the same page!

205
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:49,203
United. Doing consistent parenting.

206
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:52,903
Do you know how many books
on parenting I've read?

207
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:57,210
Deb, since high school we've been able
to read each other. Take advantage of it.

208
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:00,945
Word for word, what did you say
to Georgie exactly?

209
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,917
"No, I'm not mad."

210
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:11,927
Good guy...

211
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:13,961
bad guy.

212
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,092
Come on.

213
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,728
What the hell are you doing?
Everything's okay.

214
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,578
- John.
- Yes.

215
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,852
Do you really think that cupping my breast...

216
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,950
- is going to solve the issue here?
- It's worked before.

217
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,687
Now it's infuriating me.

218
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,793
- Wrong breast.
- Oh, my God!

219
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,492
No, I know what you mean.

220
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:53,533
Oh, my God. Don't do the calm thing.
Just don't go there. Don't do that thing.

221
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:57,032
This is very important to you. Us.

222
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:01,637
I just like to level with Georgie.
That's why I answered him this way.

223
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,072
This is not an argument, honey.

224
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,140
Yes, it is!

225
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:10,314
We're having a fight, John.
A big fight, at last.

226
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,858
So could you stop
being so stark raving calm?

227
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,098
Great God in heaven, save me.

228
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,198
Hi.

229
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:36,679
I didn't know Deb found somebody.
You work here?

230
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,376
You're gonna help out
with the house and kids?

231
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,814
You work here
and you don't speak any English at all?

232
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,722
All she has to do is dial 911
and press two for Spanish.

233
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:49,886
This is...

234
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:55,391
Flor, this is Georgie and this is John.
John, this is Flor.

235
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:57,762
Flor.

236
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,273
Great. I'll take Georgie to school.

237
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:06,072
No, I'm doing it.
I'm gonna show Flor the ropes.

238
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,574
Flor, will you come with me, please?

239
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,649
Come. Thank you.

240
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,917
- She's mad.
- You're fine. Deb?

241
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,093
- What?
- You love me.

242
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:50,649
- Not the best place to stand, fella.
- No, it's me. I'm bugged.

243
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,383
I'm sorry.

244
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,789
Not a problem.
You're the new helper, Alex, right?

245
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,055
Okay, welcome. First day.

246
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,257
John, I have something very important
to tell you.

247
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,338
- Damn.
- What?

248
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:14,846
Victor recognized a food critic
over the phone.

249
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,680
<i>- From?
- The Times.</i>

250
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:21,150
I'll bet they sent her
across the country just for us.

251
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:26,346
- Lf you're nervous, take a walk.
- I don't need a walk.

252
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,985
I'll walk with you. I know a breathing thing.

253
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,757
What do you think I'm worried about?
How I'm gonna cook?

254
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,492
That's not the thing. That's not the problem.

255
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,602
I worked at a restaurant in New York
that had four stars.

256
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,399
It was like a line formed
to become an asshole.

257
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,575
People's accents changed.

258
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,979
The heart went out of the place.
You understand?

259
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,817
- No.
- I agree with everything you just said.

260
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:59,346
I admire you for your feelings.
I hope to adopt them as my own.

261
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,766
Here we are, ladies.

262
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,136
I don't know what to root for.

263
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,434
The thought of one star gets me nauseous...

264
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:21,002
but with four, there's no place to go but,
"My God, they took away one of my stars!"

265
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,545
<i>- The Times liked the first course.
- You know what you want?</i>

266
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:30,182
Three and a quarter stars.
Yes, that would be perfect.

267
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:33,452
It'd mean you're good,
but not good enough to feel disappointed...

268
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,493
you just missed out on excellence.

269
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,529
You still get enough respect.
Good people wanna work with you.

270
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,258
Business is good, not crazy.

271
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:44,098
You're right below the radar,
where you get to mind your own business.

272
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,763
That's a good, solid life.

273
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,705
Big wipe.

274
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:06,923
I'm in the vitamin section
and this little hip-hop girl, what's her name?

275
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:11,062
Nice surprise, thank you. You want some?

276
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:17,133
This little hip-hop girl, what's her name?
Grammys.

277
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:21,830
She's famous. You kids know her. Oh, darn.

278
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:28,275
God bless the language barrier.
It keeps you from being bored with me.

279
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,874
Anyway, she said:

280
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:36,745
- "Aren't you Evelyn Wright?"
- Oh, my God!

281
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:40,019
First of all, that she remembered me
from the old covers.

282
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,617
- Yeah.
- And then she...

283
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:47,296
- Oh, please. Her name.
- Stop it.

284
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,758
- It makes the story so much better.
- It's still a good story.

285
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:54,969
She said:

286
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,502
"Whenever I think everything's"...

287
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:04,738
Pardon my French, pardon her French.
"A mother-hm-hm...

288
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,682
"I put on one of your records."

289
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:11,979
Oh, my God.

290
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,218
That is so sweet.

291
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:18,562
Well, you think your life is embarrassing,
and then...

292
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:22,532
somebody finds encouragement in it.

293
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,826
- You understand?
- I think I do.

294
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,676
Mom, it's not even noon.

295
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,942
- This is going to work.
- I don't know anything.

296
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,782
Free your mind.

297
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,652
"The president whose policies...

298
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:49,160
"many consider responsible
for the Great Depression."

299
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:50,558
I don't know.

300
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,859
- Name a vacuum cleaner.
- What?

301
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,492
- Okay, I got it.
- Hoover.

302
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,094
- I said I had it. You don't trust me?
- Okay.

303
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,037
I no longer know nothing.

304
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,372
And Hoover was followed in office by...

305
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,374
I'm just drawing blanks. I'm embarrassed.
It's my own fault.

306
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,044
I spent all my time on math,
which I'm lucky if I don't flunk, anyway.

307
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,450
Stop it.

308
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:19,213
The man you're looking for is not a ruse.

309
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,452
- What does "ruse" mean?
- Phony.

310
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,594
Roosevelt!

311
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:30,599
If I'd ever heard of that word before,
that would lock it in.

312
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,362
- Surprise! New clothes.
- What?

313
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:41,037
- What did I do right?
- It was a warehouse sale.

314
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,914
I went nuts. I got so much stuff.

315
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,386
Great! She needed a boost.

316
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:01,693
That came together.
I wouldn't wear it together, it's a little much.

317
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,239
Eight?

318
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,306
What?

319
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,282
- Eight.
- What?

320
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,685
- Bernie, come on. Listen.
- What's going on?

321
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,957
You're gonna do it,
and you're gonna look beautiful.

322
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:36,824
Honey, I just...
You are going to lose that weight, and...

323
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,624
You know...

324
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,462
I'm glad you didn't get here earlier,
because...

325
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,789
then I wouldn't be able to tell you that...

326
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,234
your gift to me...

327
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,335
is a ruse.

328
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:20,005
- Honey, I...
- Please, just excuse me.

329
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,746
- Hey, Bernie...
- I just...

330
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:27,348
I just need to be alone right now, okay?
I'm sorry. It's okay.

331
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,223
We have to be able to endure this, John,
if we're gonna help her.

332
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:38,023
I'll just gonna hang out here
and wait for you, okay?

333
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,930
Her pediatrician intervened on
his own daughter's weight, and she is an 8.

334
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,696
Dad, don't.
Didn't you ever just need a minute?

335
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:46,663
Yes.

336
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,104
This is the same page
that I'm talking about, John.

337
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:52,371
We gotta be on the same page.
That's the most important thing.

338
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,605
I don't know why it has to be so hard.

339
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,203
I need a minute.

340
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:07,451
She's right between the two sizes.
I thought about it.

341
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:11,154
What am I supposed to do?
Encourage her denial...

342
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,892
or motivate her to get herself in shape?
Flor?

343
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,128
Me go.

344
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,233
- Okay.
- I'll take you to the bus stop.

345
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,476
Sorry, I didn't even help you with the door.

346
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,609
No, what I meant was...

347
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,984
<i>My mother did not understand
her male boss.</i>

348
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:42,250
<i>He seemed as upset as she was
over what had been done to Bernice...</i>

349
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,352
Shit!

350
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,260
<i>... and yet had done nothing.</i>

351
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,673
I am running out of excuses
for the lady of the house!

352
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:02,145
But, man, Bernice's final is tomorrow.
She didn't need this one.

353
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:05,182
And just the look on her face
when she got the gifts!

354
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,047
Like for one second she thought...

355
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,951
all her problems with her mother
had been solved!

356
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:13,583
<i>He appeared to be a good man...</i>

357
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:17,253
<i>but to someone with first-hand knowledge
of Latin macho...</i>

358
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:21,826
<i>he seemed to have
the emotions of a Mexican woman.</i>

359
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:32,407
<i>She had no idea of how to react,
except to flee.</i>

360
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:41,013
What're you doing? We're still moving.

361
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,748
I'll take you all the way to the bus stop.

362
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:49,055
You got to let me take you all the way.

363
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,693
I'll take you.

364
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:02,773
All the way.

365
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,911
How weird was this ride?

366
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,580
Sorry. I'm sorry.

367
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,809
Yes, you are released. Yes.

368
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,590
Bye-bye.

369
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,484
<i>A simple request from my mother
startled me.</i>

370
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,749
<i>Her rules were bending.</i>

371
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:54,019
<i>She was losing her battle
to remain uninvolved with the Claskys.</i>

372
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,000
"Try it on."

373
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,201
Try...

374
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,127
Just. "Just try it on."

375
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,290
Just try on.

376
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,632
Just.

377
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,136
Just.

378
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,886
<i>There is one particular cultural difference...</i>

379
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:01,187
<i>which I wish to explore academically
at Princeton.</i>

380
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,755
<i>American women, I believe...</i>

381
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:08,526
<i>actually feel the same as Hispanic women
about weight.</i>

382
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,360
<i>A desire for the comfort of fullness.</i>

383
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:15,698
<i>And when that desire
is suppressed for style...</i>

384
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:18,503
<i>and deprivation allowed to rule...</i>

385
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,908
<i>dieting, exercising American women...</i>

386
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:21,877
Left!

387
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:25,609
<i>... become afraid of everything
associated with being curvaceous...</i>

388
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,186
<i>such as wantonness, lustfulness...</i>

389
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,243
Left!

390
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,916
<i>... sex, food...</i>

391
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:35,724
<i>motherhood.</i>

392
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,552
<i>All that is best in life.</i>

393
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,809
Wow!

394
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,924
Taste, she has.

395
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,587
Just try it on.

396
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:18,158
When did you learn to speak English?

397
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,432
Just try it on.

398
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,105
It's too tight. It doesn't fit.

399
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:31,977
Bernice, just try it on.

400
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,211
It's too small. I'm too big.

401
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,948
- Just try it on!
- Okay.

402
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,113
I'll show you.

403
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,656
Thanks.

404
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,660
Lovely way to start the day.

405
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:55,638
The world's most trim Mexican
learns her first sentence...

406
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:59,732
and uses it to watch me grunt my way...

407
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,074
into a...

408
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:18,357
- It fits!
- Okay.

409
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,002
No.

410
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:55,859
Thanks.

411
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:35,405
<i>Whatever happened to Frère Jacques
or Itsy-Bitsy Spider?</i>

412
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,168
- Make room.
- I know.

413
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,938
But every time he has a nightmare,
I teach him one of my old songs.

414
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,845
That way, his nightmares have a purpose.

415
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:47,207
But I don't have to sing it for anyone.

416
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,412
Right, you're clear on that.

417
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:53,549
How many did you sell of this song,
Grandma?

418
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,717
He likes to know that stuff.

419
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,260
She was huge.

420
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,060
Here goes.

421
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:06,394
76,000, which is great for a jazz album.

422
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,040
Jesus.

423
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,622
Fuck you.

424
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,625
Dad!

425
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,930
For Christ's sake, why are you screaming?

426
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,200
Why, crazy father,
why aren't you screaming?

427
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,909
I'm working on it.
The stunned thing has to get dealt with.

428

"John Clasky..."

Nice move.

We are so smooth. Right on.

00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,006
Ladies and gentlemen,
the mother of two children! Look at that.

You look good.

Go.

You don't even need me, do you?

463
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:00,469
Just go. Now she's on.

No.

It's John Clasky.

472
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:30,989
"I read your good review."

473
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,997
I read your good review.

474
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,664
They read me your good review.

475
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:44,140
- Nice.
- Not so far.

476
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,238
I'm sorry. How are you doing?

477
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,848
I do fine.

478
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,493
Be happy.

479
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,027
Be happy.

480
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,102
Yeah. Absolutely.

481
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:26,280
Congratulations. Good job.

482
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,978
- I need to talk to you.
- Oh, man. Okay.

483
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,114
- You deserved it.
- You were terrific.

484
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:37,493
Congratulations. You guys worked hard.
Way to go.

485
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,397
- Pietro, what's wrong?
- I got a fantastic offer for my own place.

486
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,562
Everyone wants to back me
since the paper came out.

487
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:55,712
I can't lose you
and keep the hours I'm keeping.

488
00:41:56,247 --> 00:42:00,479
I can't do my life unless I hold onto you.

489
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:07,746
I think I just gave you
an incredible bargaining position.

490
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:11,019
So you gave away 20% of the restaurant...

491
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,755
without even talking to me about it?

492
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:17,824
I had to, right then,
or I would have lost him.

493
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,871
Then I wouldn't have enough time
with the family.

494
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,573
- I don't exist.
- Sure you do.

495
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:39,786
I was all worried, just trying to
figure out the timing to talk to you...

496
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:42,587
about renting a place for the summer.

497
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,525
I think you have your timing.

498
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:49,899
- Mom, the realtor's here. You coming?
- Go on.

499
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,867
All right, I'll be back later.

500
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:01,972
- Hi.
- Hi there.

501
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:07,079
- I'm Mike.
- Deborah. Hi.

502
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:11,315
There's a great rental that just came
on the market, so we're starting at the top.

503
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:12,548
- Okay.
- Good.

504
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:29,431
I'm never gonna be one of those girls
whose hair...

505
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,939
flows perfectly in a convertible.

506
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,745
Move your seat forward.

507
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:38,403
I just...

508
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,382
A little more. Good.

509
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,660
You must be trouble.

510
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,175
Look at this.

511
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,740
Isn't it gorgeous?

512
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:18,584
It's beautiful. It's fabulous. Perfect.

513
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:21,747
What word is the same in Spanish?

514
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,891
Thank you.

515
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:28,561
So, this will be your room, okay?

516
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:32,598
Don't worry.
I'm gonna put lots of nice stuff in here, too.

517
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:36,936
Did you ask her if she could live in?

518
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:41,036
Come on.
There are no buses from her to here.

519
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:43,636
There's no question. Double come on.

520
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,005
The barrio, Carbon Beach.

521
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:50,053
What to do?

522
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:53,087
Come on, it's going to be so great.

523
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:56,456
I'm gonna get someone
to explain everything to you. Come on.

524
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:02,698
You must learn English.
Why won't she learn English?

525
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,063
Be careful.

526
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:09,099
I'm gonna have to learn
"you must learn English" in Spanish.

527
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,038
Excuse me.

528
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:18,072
- Excuse me, do you speak English?
- Yes, I do.

529
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:21,584
Would you please help me?
Will you translate for me with her?

530
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:24,379
Sure.

531
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,883
Sure. Forever.

532
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:28,891
He's gonna...

533
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:31,184
Give me a minute.

534
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:34,529
Okay. Hi.

535
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:36,723
I've rented a house for the summer...

536
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,429
and she needs to sleep at the house
because of the bus schedule.

537
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:49,809
No, sorry.

538
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,404
What? Why?

539
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:57,119
She can't, because her daughter.

540
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:00,619
You have a daughter?

541
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:04,055
A whole daughter you've never mentioned?

542
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:07,259
This is a little crazy that I don't know this.

543
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:09,932
No, don't translate asides.

544
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:19,999
She said she can't live here.

545
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:22,874
- Because her daughter...
- I got that.

546
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:33,545
Her daughter can also live here
for the summer. Go, tell her that.

547
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,218
Deborah, if she didn't tell us
about her child...

548
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,727
she has to have a deep sense of privacy.

549
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,266
We can figure out
how she can still live at home.

550
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,426
Hell, I don't mind driving her at night.

551
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:48,437
Let's spare the world
you on the roads, okay?

552
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,603
What am I gonna do?

553
00:46:57,548 --> 00:47:00,915
I'm sorry, my friend, but this is what I need.

554
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,220
It's just for the summer.

555
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:07,389
I don't want to lose you, but...

556
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,627
She said she live here with you.

557
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:52,558
Hey, Cristina!

558
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:55,696
Malibu. Malibu.

559
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:05,381
<i>The first time one sees natural beauty
which is privately owned...</i>

560
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:09,876
<i>oceans as people's backyards
confounds the senses.</i>

561
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:11,352
Oh, my gosh.

562
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,254
<i>I didn't know God had a toy store
for the rich.</i>

563
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:17,589
The beaches are so clean. It's beautiful.

564
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,435
Three months?

565
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:30,496
We're gonna be staying here
for three months.

566
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:36,669
We're gonna be staying at this beach
for three months! This is amazing!

567
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,617
You want to go swimming?

568
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,688
Look at this child.

569
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,760
Oh, God, you could make a fortune
at surrogate pregnancy.

570
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:01,464
How you doing? I'm John.

571
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:03,005
- Hello.
- Great.

572
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:05,232
Come on out and meet everybody.

573
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:09,677
I'm Deborah
and this is my daughter, Bernice.

574
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:13,342
Here's Georgie...

575
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:16,113
and my mother, Evelyn Wright.

576
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:17,551
So glad to meet you.

577
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,556
No comparisons, please.

578
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:24,022
I'm not even gonna respond to that.
Come here.

579
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:31,499
My mom says it's best if we go, get
out of your way, and put our things away.

580
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,626
Yes, go get settled.

581
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,070
Thank you so much. I'm thrilled to be here.

582
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,413
Okay, here's the idea.

583
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:53,923
I need to make a serving platter
for serving fish out of sea glass like this.

584
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:58,416
Just bits of broken glass
that the ocean sand...

585
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,360
blasts over the years.

586
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:03,924
So here's the deal.
You guys go hunting for it.

587
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:07,494
I'll give you 50 cents for any piece you find.

588
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:12,832
A dollar for any piece
that's bigger than that sucker right there.

589
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:18,004
All right, $5 for any piece
that isn't brown, clear, or green.

590
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:20,774
- Do we really have to do this?
- What?

591
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:24,412
- Come on.
- Let's go. Let's do this. Have fun.

592
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,281
- Come on, Chum.
- Go get them, kid.

593
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,950
- Me, too?
- Yes, of course.

594
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:32,959
Thank you.

595
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:42,828
Oh, my God, Georgie.

596
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:23,368
Cristina! Up here. Over here.

597
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,766
What's wrong?

598
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,705
She's wild-eyed over this.

599
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:02,151
Flor.

600
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,623
I'm sorry.

601
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:13,028
Very sorry.

602
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:17,422
Listen, she'll be back shortly.

603
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,834
No, you don't have to work. Give me that.

604
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:33,708
Here.

605
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:37,113
Thanks.

606
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,886
Deb made a mistake.

607
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,885
I understand how you feel.

608
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:49,564
Do you understand what I'm saying
right now, at all?

609
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:54,726
<i>- No.
- Good. Is simpático the word?</i>

610
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,981
<i>Uno momento. That's Italian.</i>

611
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:12,850
I really am sorry that this is happening.

612
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,358
I wanted you to know that.

613
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:18,785
I really. So sorry. Truly.

614
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,462
I didn't mean like...

615
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:28,734
I meant just a normal sorry.

616
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:33,309
So, I'm going to go to work.

617
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:45,050
Thank you so much.

618
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:49,384
- Thank you so much for taking me there.
- Stop thanking me.

619
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:52,150
I really enjoyed having the company.

620
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,526
The flea market was just...

621
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:57,565
I don't know what to say. It was just...

622
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,158
so many things.

623
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:02,733
And you.
You knew so much about all of them.

624
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:06,533
The way you made those people
lower the prices, though.

625
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,102
I just think that you're...

626
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:14,574
- Never mind.
- No, go ahead. I can take it.

627
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:17,376
I just think that you're...

628
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,785
the most amazing white woman
that I've ever met.

629
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:31,533
That is so nice to hear.

630
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:37,099
Absurd, but deeply appreciated, Cristina.

631
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:47,481
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you so much. That was so fun.

632
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,886
- This was the best day ever.
- What?

633
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,613
Did something bad happen?

634
00:54:56,926 --> 00:55:00,225
Cristina, tell your mother those wash
right out. It's no big deal.

635
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,787
Not right now.

636
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:07,333
What?

637
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:11,900
You can't just take someone else's kid
and then make them over.

638
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:15,638
Don't go there. Or I'll go there,
and you know where "there" is.

639
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:24,848
Can you believe what a big deal
Flor is making this into?

640
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:29,719
Please, shoot me
if I ever become that hard to deal with.

641
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,677
- What's this?
- For you.

642
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:51,707
From?

643
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,809
Look, you are not yourself.

644
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:58,320
This was written in anger. Will you hold on?

645
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:00,982
Sleep on it.
You still want me to have it, that's fine.

646
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,217
Take the letter.

647
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:05,693
I don't think that you will,
once calm and rational thought returns.

648
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:08,322
- Take the letter, Deborah.
- Just sleep on it.

649
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:13,864
She didn't even want us to know
she had a daughter...

650
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:17,668
and on the first day you take her kid away
without even asking?

651
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:20,573
- I think that's a little...
- What?

652
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:23,411
Insensitive? Elitist?

653
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,439
Narcissistic? Irresponsible? Perverse?
Dizzy? What?

654
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:28,878
Stupid.

655
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:33,946
When is anyone in this damn house...

656
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:36,958
in this damn life
gonna consider my feelings?

657
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,751
I tried to make a lovely kid feel welcome.

658
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:42,059
There is no reason to rake this over.

659
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:46,364
I let it go and gave Flor the room to let it go,
which I'm sure she has.

660
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,699
It's over, so just get on board, pal.

661
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:54,604
I slept.

662
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:13,791
Well, I'm broke.

663
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:19,232
No, please. Don't worry about it.
You really don't have to pay me.

664
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:22,100
- Please, don't worry about it.
- I'm just kidding.

665
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:28,444
- When you count it up, give me a holler.
- I did count.

666
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:32,441
Many times. I didn't sleep. I counted.

667
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:35,450
All right, what do I owe you? Give it to me.

668
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,386
$640.

669
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,754
- Really?
- Yes.

670
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:44,689
- I'm really sorry.
- No.

671
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,424
All right. I don't know.

672
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:52,900
How about
we figure this out tomorrow, okay?

673
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,961
You even told me, you said that $5...

674
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:58,467
I know, I promised.

675
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:04,212
It's all coming back to me now.
Let me just go deal with this.
