You know? I'm tracking her down.

621
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,791
''Who is the elusive Paris Hilton
and why is she so publicity shy?''

622
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,495
(LAUGHS )

623
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:27,568
'Cause...

624
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,564
Isn't it? It's good.

625
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,370
'Cause just changing it...

626
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,378
That's first room stuff, Sidney.

627
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:38,472
And call me Clay one more time,
see what happens.

628
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:46,351
(WHISPERING)
I thought that was quite good.

629
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:47,618
Sorry.

630
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,666
If I give you an interview,
will you Leave me the fuck alone?

631
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:03,332
-Bill Nathanson, nice to meet you.
-Sidney Young, Sharps magazine.

632
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:07,971
Huge fan. Lovely to meet you.
I've just seen the film

633
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:10,778
-Rap Rat.
-Good.

634
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,338
-Did you Like it?
-I did.

635
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:16,853
I did Like it. I did. I Liked
the hamster thing that you played.

636
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,013
-Actually, he's a chipmunk.
-Yeah.

637
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,750
Now, I've done a bit of research

638
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,588
and I can see
that you're quite a private man.

639
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,220
-Is that right?
-Well, I Like to keep a line...

640
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:29,460
I think that's great. That's brilliant,
but today, let's get behind the mask.

641
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,859
I don't think there really is a mask,
as such.

642
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,234
I don't mean to be a pain,
but what I really want to talk about today

643
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,398
is the new musical...

644
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,066
-Yeah.
-...and keep it about the work.

645
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:40,007
-Is that all right?
-Okay.

646
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,375
First question. Are you Jewish?

647
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:46,510
I don't see what the relevance of that is.

648
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:50,286
Okay. Well, fine. Second question.

649
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:52,948
The hamster thing that you play
in the film...

650
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,150
-It's a chipmunk.
-Whatever.

651
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,625
Is that gay?

652
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:01,661
-It's a chipmunk.
-I know, yeah, but is it a gay chipmunk?

653
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:05,631
Look, it's a kids' cartoon.
It's just a chipmunk, okay?

654
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,171
I mean,
I don't think chipmunks can be gay.

655
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,640
ALL right. So it's straight.
It's a straight chipmunk.

656
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:14,842
-Yeah, absolutely.
-Okay. Got that. So...

657
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,315
Are you gay?

658
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:25,582
I was...

659
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,951
I was trying to probe.

660
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:31,483
You want to probe,
become a proctologist.

661
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:32,586
(LAUGHS )

662
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:40,960
You can't ask a musical comedy star
whether he's Jewish or gay.

663
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:45,372
From now on, just assume
they are all Jewish and all gay.

664
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,000
-Okay?
-ALL right.

665
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,420
No, I'd Love  this, but I'm so fat I couldn't.

666
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:01,047
-Get out of here.
-You Look totally rexy.

667
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:02,648
That's so sweet.

668
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,017
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

669
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,802
I don't mean to be rude, Sidney,
but what the fuck do you want?

670
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,097
You know how things work here.

671
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,502
How am I going to get a piece
in the magazine?

672
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,837
I thought all this fluff was beneath you.

673
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:20,775
It is beneath me,
but things have changed.

674
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:22,577
What's changed?

675
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,012
Well, I know everybody thinks
I'm a bit of an idiot.

676
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:29,109
Okay, and maybe I didn't have
the best start here, but I want...

677
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,015
I want...

678
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:34,749
I want to have sex with Sophie Maes
before Maddox does.

679
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,396
You're loathsome, do you know that?

680
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:42,193
I know he's got a bit of a head start,
but I think I can win her back.

681
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:45,394
'Cause once I get my hooks into a girl,
she never gets free.

682
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,437
-Like ringworm.
-If you Like.

683
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,530
Where are you going?

684
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:59,942
You, buddy. You big corporate dick-lick.

685
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:10,087
Hello, I'd Like to apply
for a MasterCard, please.

686
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:14,126
Yeah. Hon Sidney Young.

687
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:20,265
Hon. H-O-N. It's short for ''Honorable.''
Yeah, it's a British title.

688
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:24,066
The Queen? Yeah, I know the Queen.

689
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,575
She used to be
in my break-dancing posse.

690
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,336
She's a body-popper
more than anything.

691
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,012
Fuck!

692
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,986
MADDOX: Well, Hello. Cuba !

693
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,578
(CHUCKLING)

694
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,317
He Likes you.

695
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:43,323
So, how's it feel to be a star?

696
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:47,227
No, don't, it's so embarrassing. God.
Those pictures are everywhere now,

697
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:50,096
and I had no idea that, that dress
was so see-through.

698
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:52,795
Plus, everybody's talking about it
Like it was some kind of stunt.

699
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,599
Such a cynical age.

700
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,800
Hello, Sidney.

701
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:04,810
Hi, I was just Looking for my, you know...

702
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:06,377
I didn't know you were coming in today.

703
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,509
Lawrence is taking us to lunch
at Cipriani.

704
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,547
That's nice.

705
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:13,780
Lawrence, can I Leave Cuba here?
He doesn't Like Italian food.

706
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:16,348
Of course you can.
He can stay in my office.

707
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:20,061
Sidney, fetch Cuba a bowl of water.

708
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,189
-Will you?
-Of course.

709
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,365
That is a Lovely ring.

710
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:35,843
-Where is that from?
-It was my mother's. She gave it to me.

711
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,041
You sweetie. That is very, very...

712
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:42,982
So, listen.

713
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:47,083
You've met Vincent Lepak,
haven't you, Sidney?

714
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:48,818
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

715
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:51,759
See, he has a new movie
coming out soon,

716
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:55,491
and Lawrence is overstretched as it is.

717
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,391
How would you Like
to do the feature on him?

718
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:04,500
Yeah, I would, actually.
Yes, I'd Like that very much.

719
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:06,008
Well, great.

720
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:10,341
Maybe we can get together
and discuss the angle.

721
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:11,438
Okay.

722
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:14,946
What do you mean, ''angle''?

723
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,647
Well, I'd need to know
how we're going to present Vincent.

724
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:20,917
You know, check the story and so on.

725
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:24,390
Are you saying you want copy approval?

726
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,395
Any stories written about my clients

727
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:30,194
need to be in their best interest,
that's all.

728
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,531
I mean, if things work out with Vincent,

729
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:36,963
maybe we can talk about
a follow-up story on Sophie.

730
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,103
What do you think?

731
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,371
I'm sorry, Eleanor, I don't work that way.

732
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:49,716
Sidney, dear...

733
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:54,049
Think of it Like this.
You write about one of my clients,

734
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:57,293
you are borrowing
some of their starlight

735
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,385
to help sell your magazine.

736
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:01,890
ALL I'm saying is quid pro quo.

737
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,227
Sorry. ''Starlight''?

00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:32,292
Hello, Cuba. Hello.

It's Uncle Sidney.
Come to see how you are. Yes.

You and me are going to be pals,
aren't we?

That's my bag.

760
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:51,974
Yeah, I was going to borrow it
for a second.

761
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:53,168
What are you talking about?

762
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:55,108
I'll bring it right back.
I was just going to put...

-Give me my bag.
-Just let me borrow it.

764

No. Give me my bag.

-What did you do?

When I met you,
I thought you were bit of a pain,

01:47:39,319 --> 01:47:44,222
D'you want my side,
my side of the story

1706
01:47:46,126 --> 01:47:51,063
D'you want my side,
my side of the story

1707
01:47:53,033 --> 01:47:58,198
Well, I want you,
want you like I'm eighteen

1708
01:47:59,272 --> 01:48:04,676
But I'm tied, tied to my baby

1709
01:48:04,744 --> 01:48:08,475
To my baby
Oh!

1710
01:48:09,549 --> 01:48:12,609
(ENOUGH LOVE PLAYING)

1711
01:48:21,962 --> 01:48:27,161
What hurts but feels so fine

1712
01:48:27,634 --> 01:48:32,765
What turns water into wine

1713
01:48:32,839 --> 01:48:37,333
lt runs so deep in you and me

1714
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:44,009
From a fountain to a river
to the seven seas

1715
01:48:44,084 --> 01:48:47,986
Too much push and shove

1716
01:48:48,054 --> 01:48:51,888
With not enough love to go round

1717
01:48:51,958 --> 01:48:55,359
l finally found

1718
01:48:55,428 --> 01:48:58,625
There must be enough love

1719
01:48:58,698 --> 01:49:00,689
To go round the world

1720
01:49:00,767 --> 01:49:04,464
There must be enough love

1721
01:49:04,538 --> 01:49:06,529
To go round the world

1722
01:49:06,606 --> 01:49:10,098
There must be enough love

1723
01:49:10,176 --> 01:49:12,007
To go round the world

1724
01:49:12,078 --> 01:49:18,881
There must be enough love, love, love

1725
01:49:28,261 --> 01:49:33,221
Woohoo
