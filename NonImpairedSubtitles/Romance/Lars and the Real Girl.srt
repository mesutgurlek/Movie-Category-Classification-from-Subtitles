1
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:18,671
I'm inviting you to breakfast.

2
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:25,383
I can not, I have to go to the church. 

3
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:32,158
Well, after the church then? 

4
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,866
Come on, we have not seen
you for so long.

5
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:40,806
Take this, I do not want 
Your little baby geat a sick. 

6
00:02:41,106 --> 00:02:43,740
It is so cold out. 

7
00:02:48,322 --> 00:02:50,136
Come on. 
-- OK. 

8
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,794
Will you come? 

9
00:02:57,954 --> 00:03:00,496
Oh yeah. 

10
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,147
Great. 

11
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:06,952
Could you put that whole thing on...? 
-- Oh yeah.

12
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,792
You owe me five dollars.

13
00:03:33,818 --> 00:03:37,049
Until I see him at the table appear, 
I owed nothing. 

14
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,988
There is something going on with him.
I am worried. 

15
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,560
You keep saying that, I ... 

16
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:49,452
Think that there are other things 
To contribute. 

17
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:57,443
<i> Across the world ...</ i> 

18
00:03:57,444 --> 00:04:02,382
<i> There are books on love. </ I> 

19
00:04:02,383 --> 00:04:07,536
<i> But in this world there is 
Really only one love. </ I> 

20
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:12,486
<i> We never have to ask: 
'Lord, what should I do'? </ I> 

21
00:04:12,487 --> 00:04:16,675
<i> Because the Lord has told us 
What we should do. </ I> 

22
00:04:16,676 --> 00:04:19,843
<i> Hou apart </ i>. 

23
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:24,887
<i> That my friends, is the only true law. </ I> 

24
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:29,492
<i> Love is God at work. </ I> 

25
00:04:29,493 --> 00:04:32,397
<i> The blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
The love of God ...</ i> 

26
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:36,656
<i> The fellowship of the Holy Ziel, 
Will now and forever with you. </ I> 

27
00:04:36,657 --> 00:04:39,133
<i> Amen. </ I> 

28
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:50,488
I think you can use some help. 
-- Thank you, dear. 

29
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:54,565
I moved it to the hospital. 

30
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,312
You are a great guy, Lars. 

31
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:02,073
Where is your girlfriend? 

32
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:05,278
That I did not. 
-- Are you a gay? -- No. 

33
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,223
My grandson is a gay. 
I know several gay. 

34
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,417
That, I know, but I am 
Not gay, so ... 

35
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:14,771
Let it not so long, 
That is not good for you. 

36
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:18,939
Here. 

37
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:23,845
Give this to begin, 
A nice person. 

38
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:29,926
Hello, Lars. 

39
00:05:44,783 --> 00:05:48,997
I see you tomorrow at work. 
-- Yeah, well. 

40
00:05:52,694 --> 00:05:55,839
My brother is twenty-seven, 
Maybe he wants to be left alone. 

41
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,452
That plan is not. 
-- Seriously ... 

42
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:00,527
Ga. 

43
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:03,186
How do you know that? 
-- Because ... 

44
00:06:03,187 --> 00:06:05,399
People are not. 

45
00:06:08,273 --> 00:06:10,348
That's what he says. 

46
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:17,716
Come on, you promised. 

47
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:27,804
Is this normal? 
-- Five dollar. 

48
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:14,035
Good morning. 
-- Good morning, Cindy. 

49
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:16,651
Do you have a nice weekend? 

50
00:07:17,546 --> 00:07:20,843
This new girl is fun, huh? 

51
00:07:20,844 --> 00:07:23,656
You and Margo? What do you think of it? 

52
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:38,073
Lars, you have to see this. 

53
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:40,371
I am not really this morning 
In the mood for porn. 

54
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:42,375
It is not porn. 

55
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:47,222
Well, that's it. 
But come take a look. 

56
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:50,519
Do you like this? 

57
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,397
This is a solid body. If they 
Weighs 125 pounds, it weighs 125 pounds. 

58
00:07:56,398 --> 00:07:59,979
You can be everything to your liking, 
You have all these different heads ... 

59
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,974
And parts. You can design your own wife. 

60
00:08:10,796 --> 00:08:13,567
They are anatomically correct. 

61
00:08:19,406 --> 00:08:21,479
It is not a buy? 

62
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,797
That I would. 

63
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:27,521
Look how much they cost. 
I have nothing more, after my new Xbox. 

64
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:31,633
Good morning. 

65
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:34,584
Good morning. 
-- Hello, good morning. 

66
00:08:34,585 --> 00:08:37,107
Everyone, Margo is here. Hooray. 

67
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:44,185
Can you do that thing to do? 

68
00:08:50,016 --> 00:08:54,614
I was thinking. We are the only ones in 
Come from the lake, we can car-pooling. 

69
00:08:57,195 --> 00:08:59,586
Lars, it's your day at coffee 
To retrieve, buddy. 

70
00:08:59,587 --> 00:09:01,721
Yes. 

71
00:09:05,772 --> 00:09:08,462
You know what your problem is, Margo? 
You are too aggressive. 

72
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:11,483
Put a little calmer. 

73
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,575
Keep your head. 

74
00:09:14,785 --> 00:09:17,676
<i> Mostly cloudy later in the evening 
Snow </ i>. 

75
00:09:17,677 --> 00:09:20,734
<i> There is chance of snow after midnight. </ I> 

76
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:24,651
Wait, stop. 

77
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:29,506
Karin, what? 

78
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,721
We wish that you will eat. 

79
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:36,882
Do you? 

80
00:09:44,081 --> 00:09:47,309
You have let me scared. 

81
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:50,718
Sweetheart, excuse me. 

82
00:09:51,287 --> 00:09:53,340
Wait. 

83
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:56,906
I can not. 
-- Why not? 

84
00:09:57,869 --> 00:10:01,572
Why not? 
Lars Come on, we miss you. 

85
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:08,270
I work back home, 
So I have to ... otherwise I come in difficulty. 

86
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:12,766
You did not. 
-- That is my phone, I think. 

87
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:15,677
Come on, wait. 
Lars, stop. 

88
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:22,582
Come on, please? 
-- I have other plans. 

89
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,999
I can not. 

90
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,431
There is salmon, and kersentaart. 

91
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:35,334
Would you please let me go? 
-- No. 

92
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:58,143
Is that all you can eat? 
-- Yes, it was delicious. Thank you. 

93
00:10:58,144 --> 00:11:01,336
No, you keep it. 
It's my turn. 

94
00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:04,589
And what talk, please. 

95
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:16,995
Karin is worried about you, 
They think you have a problem ... 

96
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:19,954
Because you spend so much time alone,. 

97
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,208
Everything is fine with me. 
-- That I said it. 

98
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:28,802
That is exactly what I said. 

99
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:33,945
Papa was also a bit so, so ... 

100
00:11:33,946 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes, but he wanted no one around them 
. So that's a difference. 

101
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:42,516
That is not true. 

102
00:11:45,676 --> 00:11:49,286
Yes, of course, maybe after 
Mum died, but ... 

103
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:52,003
That you knew him, so ... 

104
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,744
That could you not, but I 
Just say ... 

105
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:13,604
Karin and I would be very grateful, 
If you would come and live with us. 

106
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:19,821
That does not, thank you. 
-- The house is for half of you. 

107
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:23,106
Yes, I know. 
But everything is fine with me, thanks. 

108
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,255
I put only on the table. 

109
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:33,571
Good night. Sleep good. 
-- Good night. 

110
00:12:33,572 --> 00:12:36,919
Wait. Here are some leftovers for you. 

111
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,384
Do you have my blanket? 

112
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:42,898
Yes, that is ... 
-- I grab it, even like this. 

113
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,268
I am so back. 

114
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,837
It is a beautiful blanket. 

115
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:53,282
Gus says that your mother 
Made for you. 

116
00:12:53,283 --> 00:12:55,653
When she was pregnant. 

117
00:12:58,505 --> 00:13:00,957
They need a lot of your account. 

118
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,386
Just as we do. 

119
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,553
Are you angry with me? 
-- Does he have? 

120
00:13:12,554 --> 00:13:16,527
Please. Good night. 
-- Thanks. Good night. 

121
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:55,810
Six weeks later 

122
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:12,452
<i> Hello? 
-- Hello, Lars. You speak with Karin </ i>. 

123
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:15,787
<i> There is a large box just for you. 
It is in the garage. </ I> 

124
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:21,365
Okay, thanks. 

125
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:23,599
Thanks. 

126
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:25,276
This is a beautiful sweater. 

127
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:45,209
Come inside. 

128
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:51,984
It is good. Can Karin 
Even to the door? 

129
00:15:54,345 --> 00:15:56,817
Sweetheart, get even. 
Lars is there. 

130
00:15:56,818 --> 00:15:59,461
Really? 
-- Yes. 

131
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,798
It does ... 

132
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,352
Yoga for pregnant women. 

133
00:16:11,343 --> 00:16:13,786
This is good stuff. 

134
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:17,063
What is happening? 

135
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,633
I have a guest. 

136
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:26,155
You have a ...? 

137
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:29,668
A score? 

138
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:32,636
That's great. 

139
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,885
And she is not here in the neighborhood. 
-- They? 

140
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:45,394
What should you say to me. Where ... 

141
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:47,519
Where did you meet? 

142
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,810
On the Internet. 
-- Nowadays everybody does that. 

143
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,663
That's great. 

144
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:57,703
She speaks little English only. 

145
00:16:57,704 --> 00:17:03,218
That is not bad. That is the same as 
The people on my work. That is not bad. 

146
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:11,214
She is in a wheelchair, so I want 
Not that they are there rot by feel. 

147
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:19,052
And I want to ask you something, I know 
It is a very big favor. 

148
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:27,395
She is very religious, and because we 
Both still young ... 

149
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:32,508
And single. So it is not good for 
Us alone together in the garage. 

150
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,983
They may be in the pink room. 
-- They can sleep. 

151
00:17:34,984 --> 00:17:37,967
In the pink room? 
-- Yes, of course. 

152
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:40,886
And there are new towels. 

153
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:48,506
Give us half an hour, 
Something in the oven to stop ... 

154
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:51,393
Then we make the place ready. 

155
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:58,064
Let's begin. 

156
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:02,305
That is ... 

157
00:18:03,497 --> 00:18:06,626
You silent figures, 
You know what they say ... 

158
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,942
It's great. 

159
00:18:09,943 --> 00:18:12,580
I see you like this. 

160
00:18:36,178 --> 00:18:38,759
Bianca is a missionary. 

161
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,110
Was a missionary. I am sorry. 

162
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:43,721
Because they were growing up 
By nuns. 

163
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:47,389
But now she is on leave so that they 
The world can experience. Is that not too crazy? 

164
00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:56,528
She is shy. 

165
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:58,610
That is you. 

166
00:18:58,611 --> 00:19:02,305
Everything is still so new. 

167
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:05,068
For her, right? 

168
00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:13,627
Are you hungry? 
-- We are starved. 

169
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,414
Gus, do you want to help me even in the kitchen? 

170
00:19:24,485 --> 00:19:28,124
That was that. 
I know. 

171
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:39,829
He is crazy, right? 

172
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:45,416
What should we do? 
-- I do not know. 

173
00:19:49,115 --> 00:19:53,653
We need to call the hospital, 
I think. 

174
00:19:53,654 --> 00:19:56,044
The hospital I can not afford ... 

175
00:19:56,045 --> 00:20:00,096
I can not believe it. 
My little brother is certifiably crazy. 

176
00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:04,584
Control you. 
Gus, quietly. 

177
00:20:04,585 --> 00:20:07,661
He speaks with a pop. 

178
00:20:07,662 --> 00:20:10,285
We meet here on this or 
Or through other means, right? 

179
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:12,774
I do not know what I should do. 
-- I know it does not. 

180
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:15,202
You must remain calm. 

181
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:23,582
I am sorry. 
-- It is good. 

182
00:20:27,716 --> 00:20:30,200
Karin, she is not eating. 

183
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:01,340
You will never believe this ... 

184
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:03,657
It makes me so angry. 

185
00:21:03,658 --> 00:21:06,790
Bianca comes from the tropics ... 

186
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,403
It is a Brazilian ... 

187
00:21:09,404 --> 00:21:13,243
Half Brazilian, half Danish, that's right ... 

188
00:21:16,957 --> 00:21:19,330
Someone has stolen her luggage. 

189
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,773
Yes, and they have stolen her wheelchair. 

190
00:21:27,357 --> 00:21:29,870
That's terrible. 

191
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,776
Yes. Can you believe that, Gus? 

192
00:21:33,695 --> 00:21:36,237
Yes, I can believe it. 
-- Good. 

193
00:21:37,926 --> 00:21:40,488
It makes me angry. 

194
00:21:40,489 --> 00:21:43,624
Anyway ... 

195
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,648
I want you to ask a favor. 

196
00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:49,008
She believes that is not bad, I promise you. 

197
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:53,382
Karin, do you think it is not really for Bianca 
What clothes to borrow. She has nothing. 

198
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:06,951
Would you do that? 

199
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:09,627
I do not know whether we taste the same, Lars. 

200
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:13,249
That is not very Karin, because Bianca 
Not much does ...

201
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,746
For that kind of superficial things. 
So that's not a problem. 

202
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:28,000
Sure. 

203
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:30,154
See you. I told you al 

204
00:22:30,155 --> 00:22:32,257
Thanks. 

205
00:22:33,709 --> 00:22:37,589
This is the room of my mother. 

206
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,751
If you need something, Gus and Karin 
Are in the front hall. 

207
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:45,118
I am in the garage. 

208
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,631
But you know it. 
Even something else? 

209
00:22:48,632 --> 00:22:52,737
You have brand new towels, 
Karin thanks. 

210
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:59,308
Lars, I think we go to bed 
Should go. 

211
00:23:01,638 --> 00:23:03,211
Not quite even. 

212
00:23:03,212 --> 00:23:07,713
I just wanted to say that I am so happy, 
That you are finally here. 

213
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:12,250
Lars, I think we now ... 

214
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:15,463
Good night. 

215
00:23:25,272 --> 00:23:28,274
Wait, Gus had a good idea. 

216
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:32,737
He is concerned about Bianca's health. 

217
00:23:32,738 --> 00:23:37,643
Just with that travel, and 
Changing climate and everything ... 

218
00:23:37,644 --> 00:23:39,704
Stress, you know? 

219
00:23:39,705 --> 00:23:44,699
I make an appointment with Dr. Birnman 
For tomorrow. Tomorrow early. 

220
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,355
That we all. 
-- Yes, you reminds you Dagmar is there? 

221
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:55,163
Do you think it is a good idea. 
-- I think we should do. 

222
00:23:55,164 --> 00:24:01,542
Yes, that's a good idea. I would indeed 
Still go to a wheelchair. 

223
00:24:01,543 --> 00:24:04,793
Good night. 
-- Good night. 

224
00:24:04,794 --> 00:24:07,102
I can see you tomorrow. 

225
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:18,546
True pop. 

226
00:25:18,547 --> 00:25:20,633
<i> Natasha escaped from Moscow. </ I> 

227
00:25:20,634 --> 00:25:23,696
<i> Where they were forced to 
The Russian mafia to strip </ i>. 

228
00:25:23,697 --> 00:25:27,349
<i> Now she wants only one American man 
Worth Loving </ i>. 

229
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,068
<i> Nadori, a job well 
In Tokyo specified ...</ i> 

230
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:33,820
<i> Because as a woman she was dissatisfied </ i>. 

231
00:25:33,821 --> 00:25:37,554
<i> Tammy is gone from school, 
To the rodeo to come. </ I> 

232
00:25:37,555 --> 00:25:41,995
<i> Are you the right to cowboy 
This wild foal to tame </ i>. 

233
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:58,928
The doctor will tell us 
What we should do. 

234
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:02,434
But it is a huisdokter. 
We have a psychiatrist. 

235
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,557
No, that's it. 
She is also a psychologist. 

236
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:11,425
She says that they have to, 
Extent in the north. 

237
00:26:16,138 --> 00:26:18,781
What will the people think? 

238
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,572
Since we can not worry 
To make. 

239
00:26:26,566 --> 00:26:28,878
Right. 

240
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,526
Since my father worked. 

241
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:51,629
Our father. 

242
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,567
That is the library. I have a map, 
That you can borrow if you like. 

243
00:26:56,568 --> 00:27:01,185
I must actually address 
But you can tell which. 

244
00:27:03,648 --> 00:27:06,490
I really do not know, Gus ... 

245
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,469
What does dad really 
Always done? 

246
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,559
Water and energy. 

247
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:23,857
I work in education. 

248
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:29,947
I miss everybody, but there is at home 
So much to do. 

249
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:33,849
I will be back, as the old baby 
Enough and you ... 

250
00:27:50,818 --> 00:27:55,250
Yes, of course. 'Readers Digest'. 

251
00:27:57,254 --> 00:28:00,422
'West Living', or 'Country'. 

252
00:28:01,538 --> 00:28:04,141
That I should also say. 

253
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,804
She has low blood pressure. 

254
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,738
Is that serious? 
-- That could be. 

255
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,334
We must wait and see. 

256
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:38,812
It is good, mine 
Probably low. 

257
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:50,942
I want to see her every week you here 
Brings, for a special treatment. 

258
00:28:50,943 --> 00:28:54,119
Can you do that? 

259
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:01,470
Yes, you certainly know that it 
Necessary? 

260
00:29:02,528 --> 00:29:05,282
Yes. 
-- Good. 

261
00:29:07,508 --> 00:29:09,564
What do you think? 

262
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:13,378
If she says that we should do. 

263
00:29:15,876 --> 00:29:19,356
You can make an appointment by Jo-Anne, 
At the bar. 

264
00:29:20,804 --> 00:29:24,346
I would be delighted to see 
To teach you know, Bianca. 

265
00:29:27,845 --> 00:29:30,796
I tell you that he is in a hospital 
Belong. 

266
00:29:30,797 --> 00:29:35,401
No. My uncle Gart is, 
And he has never returned. 

267
00:29:35,402 --> 00:29:38,066
But he has more help than 
You and I can give him. 

268
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,787
I have told you that something is not 
OK, but you did not want to listen. 

269
00:29:39,788 --> 00:29:41,836
Do you mind? 

270
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:47,564
Does Lars? Is he to his work, 
Wash himself, dresses himself? 

271
00:29:47,565 --> 00:29:50,034
So far, yes. 

272
00:29:50,035 --> 00:29:55,001
Has he violent attacks? 
-- No, never. 

273
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,661
It is a dear. 
He never even raises his voice. 

274
00:29:59,128 --> 00:30:01,291
We need him back refurbishment. 
-- Can you refurbishment him? 

275
00:30:01,292 --> 00:30:03,459
I do not know, Gus. 

276
00:30:04,589 --> 00:30:08,098
I do not think that he is psychotic 
Or schizophrenic. 

277
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:12,672
I do not think that this is by genes 
Caused, or a short circuit in the brains. 

278
00:30:12,673 --> 00:30:14,841
What's damn then on? 

279
00:30:14,842 --> 00:30:18,217
He appears to have a waanvoorstelling. 
-- A waanvoorstelling? 

280
00:30:18,218 --> 00:30:21,662
What does he godsnaam 
With a waanvoorstelling. 

281
00:30:21,663 --> 00:30:23,972
We should look forward to search. 

282
00:30:23,973 --> 00:30:27,171
The probability is that he's been a while to 
The decompenseren. 

283
00:30:29,648 --> 00:30:32,201
I think we hear that 
Not achieved. 

284
00:30:34,737 --> 00:30:38,927
Are there changes the last year 
In the family? 

285
00:30:38,928 --> 00:30:43,919
No, everything is about the same, 
Except that Karin is pregnant and ... 

286
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,477
Lars that crazy. 

287
00:30:45,478 --> 00:30:48,790
You know, that does not necessarily 
Just something to be ... 

288
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:53,299
What we call disease of the mind, 
Is not always a disease ... 

289
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,519
It can be a way of communicating, 
A way of solving something. 

290
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,854
Fantastic. When will 
Taking? 

291
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,642
When he no longer needs. 

292
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:08,030
How can we help? 

293
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:14,270
Go there. 
-- No. 

294
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:21,740
Do or she really is? 
I can not, I do not. 

295
00:31:21,741 --> 00:31:23,022
It is real. 

296
00:31:23,803 --> 00:31:28,219
It is beyond. 
-- That I snap ... 

297
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,749
I do not. 

298
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,623
You will find him not mind 
Subject to change. 

299
00:31:33,624 --> 00:31:36,628
Bianca is in the city for a reason. 
-- But ... 

300
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:38,723
It is not really a choice. 

301
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,151
Then we do it. 
Everything but necessary. 

302
00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:49,400
Yes, and everyone will uitlachen him. 

303
00:31:49,401 --> 00:31:51,252
And you 

304
00:32:04,825 --> 00:32:07,233
She loves children. 

305
00:32:12,517 --> 00:32:15,567
Even as coffee, Lars? 
-- Yes, please. 

306
00:32:16,905 --> 00:32:19,436
May I see your funny face? 

307
00:32:21,421 --> 00:32:24,140
Wil Bianca also what? 

308
00:32:24,141 --> 00:32:26,140
Yes. 

309
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,845
Please. 
-- Thank you very much, Karin. 

310
00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:32,106
Gus not? 

311
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:34,283
Sure. 

312
00:32:40,034 --> 00:32:42,396
Do you not to your work today, Gus? 

313
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,695
I am not so good. 

314
00:32:50,155 --> 00:32:53,348
Maybe you can help Bianca, 
She has a verpleegstersopleiding. 

315
00:32:53,349 --> 00:32:57,774
No, she has not, she has 
No verpleegstersopleiding Lars, 

316
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,323
Because they are not human beings. 

317
00:32:59,823 --> 00:33:02,155
It is a big plastic thing. 

318
00:33:03,252 --> 00:33:05,628
Since I am struck by. 

319
00:33:07,095 --> 00:33:09,528
Have you heard? 

320
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:13,383
Bianca said that God made her why 
. In order to help people. 

321
00:33:21,367 --> 00:33:26,011
Are you not too late in your work? 

322
00:33:30,472 --> 00:33:32,904
I come too late. 

323
00:33:32,905 --> 00:33:34,930
Well, I have to go. 

324
00:33:37,176 --> 00:33:40,206
I will notify me. 

325
00:33:40,207 --> 00:33:43,374
You have reached the number of my work, Karin? 
-- Yes. 

326
00:33:49,502 --> 00:33:53,898
I wanted to tell you that you 
Look very nice today. 

327
00:33:58,184 --> 00:34:00,877
I hope that you feel more comfortable, Gus. 

328
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:05,638
I hope so too. 
-- Thanks for breakfast. 

329
00:34:06,437 --> 00:34:09,108
I must go. 
-- See you later. 

330
00:34:13,831 --> 00:34:16,014
I had to try. 

331
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,802
What? 

332
00:34:19,803 --> 00:34:23,254
It's just ... 
I do not know. 

333
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:28,980
It is true. We are very 
With ourselves busy, Gus. 

334
00:34:28,981 --> 00:34:31,213
That is not my fault. 

335
00:34:31,214 --> 00:34:33,289
It is not my fault. 

336
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:43,082
Come on, Bianca. 
We are going to consult some calls. 

337
00:34:58,962 --> 00:35:01,096
Good morning, Cindy. 
You look nice today. 

338
00:35:01,097 --> 00:35:03,733
Thank you, Hr. Heula ... 

339
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:11,957
It is well in advance, but you know how 
I am excited that things can be. 

340
00:35:18,844 --> 00:35:21,807
Where are they, I know that you have caught them. 
I did not. -- Yes. 

341
00:35:21,808 --> 00:35:25,227
This is revenge. -- What? 
-- The fake thing in your la. 

342
00:35:25,228 --> 00:35:29,038
That. 
-- Lars, I miss three of my action figures. 

343
00:35:30,784 --> 00:35:32,535
It's your turn to get coffee. 

344
00:35:32,536 --> 00:35:37,403
Listen Margo, who actiefiguren 
Are very important to me ... 

345
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:40,984
They are worth a lot of money, and if I do 
All that fast on my desk think ... 

346
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:45,200
Then you can go against your teddy bear 
Saying that he should. 

347
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:59,220
I will put them back, one by one. 

348
00:36:04,148 --> 00:36:05,981
Go thou to Cindy's party? 

349
00:36:05,982 --> 00:36:08,750
No. 

350
00:36:09,258 --> 00:36:13,407
I hoped that you would come. 
I would like you also came. 

351
00:36:15,745 --> 00:36:17,458
Maybe. 

352
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:19,865
That would be great. 

353
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:23,659
Do you think my girlfriend 
Can bring? 

354
00:36:25,923 --> 00:36:29,611
Yes, I am also someone. 

355
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:42,375
I did not know that there are such dolls existed. 
-- They call them liefdespoppen. 

356
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:48,796
I saw that special in 'People'. 
-- Really? Bianca has a ... 

357
00:36:51,582 --> 00:36:54,325
She is one of the girls. 

358
00:36:55,528 --> 00:36:57,362
I am sorry. 

359
00:37:06,227 --> 00:37:07,801
Really. 

360
00:37:09,707 --> 00:37:11,421
Have a sister? 

361
00:37:13,187 --> 00:37:15,777
I wish I had a wife 
Who could not talk. 

362
00:37:19,992 --> 00:37:21,531
That is not so funny. 

363
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:25,149
We want nothing to do with her 
. She is a 'golden calf'. 

364
00:37:26,172 --> 00:37:28,910
We all know what has happened thus. 
-- He does not worship her, 

365
00:37:28,911 --> 00:37:32,328
He is only with her? 
-- These young people have no willpower. 

366
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:34,850
He is sick. 

367
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:38,255
We were hoping if we came to you 
That you have been able to help ... 

368
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,906
Obsežnim the road a bit. 

369
00:37:40,907 --> 00:37:43,578
If you could try to understand. 

370
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:46,708
We can try. 

371
00:37:46,709 --> 00:37:49,785
In earth, which is now 
The high point. 

372
00:37:51,628 --> 00:37:55,528
Sally, your cousin draws his cats 
Dresses. 

373
00:37:56,386 --> 00:38:00,587
Hazel, your cousin gave all his money 
To a UFO club. 

374
00:38:00,588 --> 00:38:03,866
Ernie, everyone knows that you 
First wife was a kleptomaan. 

375
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:05,478
That she was not. 
-- Why is it then buried ... 

376
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:07,347
With a couple of my earrings. 

377
00:38:07,348 --> 00:38:09,625
It is enough. 

378
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:11,778
Those things happen. 

379
00:38:13,474 --> 00:38:15,478
Lars is a good boy. 

380
00:38:18,815 --> 00:38:21,156
You can count on me. 

381
00:38:21,157 --> 00:38:23,428
Thank you Mrs. Gruner. 

382
00:38:24,794 --> 00:38:27,738
He takes her not more 
To the church, or Reverend Bock? 

383
00:38:30,757 --> 00:38:34,166
The question is, as always ... 

384
00:38:36,771 --> 00:38:38,772
What would Jesus do? 

385
00:39:05,505 --> 00:39:07,882
<i> I would like to take this opportunity 
Like to take this ...</ i> 

386
00:39:07,883 --> 00:39:11,556
<i> To browse all the new visitors 
Today to welcome in our church. </ I> 

387
00:39:13,377 --> 00:39:17,064
Bianca, nice to see you. 
-- Lars, God bless you. 

388
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:20,358
Thank you, Reverend. 

389
00:39:28,245 --> 00:39:30,505
These are for you, Bianca. 

390
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,113
This is my girlfriend, Ga. Gruner. 

391
00:39:35,992 --> 00:39:38,305
She has a beautiful figure. 

392
00:39:42,901 --> 00:39:46,598
They are not really here, which 
Always remain. Fun, huh? 

393
00:39:52,696 --> 00:39:54,789
Come here. 

394
00:40:30,902 --> 00:40:33,910
Watch out. 

395
00:40:39,508 --> 00:40:41,651
I Remove the seat. 

396
00:40:41,652 --> 00:40:44,105
Can you her belt driving? 

397
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:47,598
Bianca, Gus makes your belt. 

398
00:40:48,444 --> 00:40:51,001
Can you do that on her legs, otherwise 
They get cold. Thank you. 

399
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:05,731
Thank you very much, Gus. 

400
00:41:07,594 --> 00:41:10,774
Where do you go?

401
00:41:14,202 --> 00:41:15,894
One moment. 

402
00:41:16,813 --> 00:41:20,331
They do not know, it's a secret. 
I can tell you however. 

403
00:41:20,332 --> 00:41:24,093
They always ask me anything, and they 
Wants to know anything from me, so ... 

404
00:41:24,094 --> 00:41:27,301
I thought I could take her 
To the lake. 

405
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,321
What we always played. 

406
00:41:29,322 --> 00:41:32,531
Remind you you know? 
-- Yes. 

407
00:41:33,473 --> 00:41:36,014
That sounds fun. 

408
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,714
I must go. 

409
00:41:39,715 --> 00:41:42,036
I come out. 
Why you cry? 

410
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:07,987
Gus and his friends came 
Here always. 

411
00:42:08,957 --> 00:42:10,671
They were here to fish. 

412
00:42:10,672 --> 00:42:14,412
Another time they went hockeyen. 

413
00:42:14,413 --> 00:42:19,930
Whether they built all 
The nice cabins. 

414
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:33,568
This is the tree, 
A rope to swing. 

415
00:42:34,476 --> 00:42:36,985
And the ladder. 

416
00:42:38,302 --> 00:42:41,012
Mental Illness waanvoorstelling 

417
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:49,726
You would have to see me chopping wood. 

418
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,540
I am really good at it. 

419
00:44:02,745 --> 00:44:05,040
I am sorry. 

420
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:08,588
I could no longer wait, I wanted 
See how it went with her. 

421
00:44:08,589 --> 00:44:12,806
After treatment they must rest. 
The work not, as they do not rust. 

422
00:44:15,785 --> 00:44:19,087
Keep me company, Lars. 

423
00:44:19,088 --> 00:44:21,477
Keep me company. 

424
00:44:31,448 --> 00:44:34,549
Do you know how many treatments 
They still need? 

425
00:44:37,322 --> 00:44:41,239
No, I do not know. 
It is a difficult disease, Lars. 

426
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:47,847
But what I can use 
A complete background of her. 

427
00:44:47,882 --> 00:44:51,332
As parents ... 
-- Die died when she was a baby. 

428
00:44:52,643 --> 00:44:55,972
That is not fair. 
-- Yes, but ... 

429
00:44:55,973 --> 00:44:59,694
They have no compassion for himself, 
They would just ... 

430
00:44:59,695 --> 00:45:02,554
That it is normal. 
That everyone treats her normal. 

431
00:45:04,982 --> 00:45:07,775
That's nice. 
That I admire. 

432
00:45:07,776 --> 00:45:10,807
Yes, I too. 
Is that your husband? 

433
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:14,332
Yes, he is deceased. 

434
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:18,423
No right? That I am sorry. 

435
00:45:20,822 --> 00:45:22,974
Do you have children? 
-- No. 

436
00:45:27,674 --> 00:45:29,676
You must feel very lonely. 

437
00:45:29,677 --> 00:45:34,143
Sometimes I am so lonely that I forget what 
Day it is, and how I should name games. 

438
00:45:40,273 --> 00:45:42,885
How about with you? 

439
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:47,515
You are funny. 

440
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:51,902
What is the difference between a waanvoor - 
Assertion in a hallucination? 

441
00:45:53,314 --> 00:45:56,493
It is a false perception, 
Compared with a false assumption. 

442
00:45:56,494 --> 00:45:58,687
So if Mous believe that the FBI 
Aanzit behind him ... 

443
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:00,275
The DEA. 
-- The INS. 

444
00:46:00,276 --> 00:46:04,390
The IRS, ATF, the AAA. 
-- That would be a waanvoorstelling. 

445
00:46:04,391 --> 00:46:07,358
Guy, who sit behind us. 

446
00:46:14,442 --> 00:46:17,223
That said I would like al .. 

447
00:46:17,224 --> 00:46:21,504
Already three times that wood warms you. 

448
00:46:21,505 --> 00:46:26,339
Therefore, I am in pieces heels. 

449
00:46:45,507 --> 00:46:48,363
What do we do? Why are we doing this for him? 
-- Come on. 

450
00:46:50,401 --> 00:46:53,112
This is funny. 

451
00:46:53,113 --> 00:46:55,026
Is that true? 

452
00:46:57,304 --> 00:47:00,607
I do not know. Maybe not. 

453
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,558
Tell me something about Karin. 

454
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,766
I know its not so good. 

455
00:47:11,767 --> 00:47:14,149
It's great. 

456
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:17,320
Gus and I are both happy with 
Women. It's great. 

457
00:47:19,693 --> 00:47:23,077
But they ... 

458
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:28,837
We do not need to talk. 
I am looking for something to read for you. 

459
00:47:28,838 --> 00:47:31,343
No, it's just ... 

460
00:47:32,101 --> 00:47:34,712
Between us. 
-- Sure. 

461
00:47:38,126 --> 00:47:40,635
I am concerned about her. 

462
00:47:40,636 --> 00:47:43,353
I think she has a small glitch. 

463
00:47:43,354 --> 00:47:47,378
Maybe you should not tell me. 
-- No, that's just fine. It is only ... 

464
00:47:51,245 --> 00:47:54,056
I think because it is uncertain, but ... 

465
00:47:54,057 --> 00:47:57,067
She always tries to embrace everyone. 

466
00:47:57,068 --> 00:48:01,075
Are you? Some people do not. 
Some people do not want to be embraced. 

467
00:48:01,076 --> 00:48:04,546
But realize that they are not. 
She draws it personally. 

468
00:48:04,547 --> 00:48:08,175
And things ... 
That hurt her. 

469
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:14,243
I do not know what I should do. 

470
00:48:16,031 --> 00:48:17,764
Do you know that? 

471
00:48:17,765 --> 00:48:20,253
But it is sometimes as a consolation. 

472
00:48:20,254 --> 00:48:23,429
Just someone his arms around you 
Having. Think you not? 

473
00:48:24,991 --> 00:48:28,246
No. 
-- Come on, it feels good. 

474
00:48:29,225 --> 00:48:31,946
That does not feel good. 
That hurts. 

475
00:48:35,886 --> 00:48:38,219
If a cut or a bruise? 

476
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:41,230
If a burn. 
As you go out, and ... 

477
00:48:41,231 --> 00:48:46,571
That your feet freeze and you go back 
Indoors and they thawing weather, something. 

478
00:48:46,572 --> 00:48:49,805
It is almost exactly true. 

479
00:48:49,806 --> 00:48:52,642
Feels that all true? 

480
00:48:54,912 --> 00:48:57,642
By Bianca not. 

481
00:49:00,818 --> 00:49:03,042
But everyone else does. 

482
00:49:03,043 --> 00:49:05,489
So you let the people you do not touch. 

483
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:08,484
Lars, it is not difficult to 
Since it away? 

484
00:49:09,914 --> 00:49:14,485
I am not like you, because 
I have all these layers. 

485
00:49:16,129 --> 00:49:18,780
That helps. 
-- Listen ... 

486
00:49:18,781 --> 00:49:21,291
Karin we can not change. 

487
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:25,756
But, I can help you. 

488
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,542
That is good. 

489
00:49:40,014 --> 00:49:42,889
Pain? 
-- Yes, but I can be uithouden. 

490
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:55,625
Is all well with you? 

491
00:49:58,651 --> 00:50:00,758
It is enough for today. 

492
00:50:00,858 --> 00:50:03,032
Yes, thanks. 

493
00:50:10,459 --> 00:50:12,206
Yes, good. 

494
00:50:24,764 --> 00:50:30,029
It has been scientifically proven that everyone 
His favourite word their own name is ... 

495
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,248
If you simply their name 
Says out loud, right? 

496
00:50:36,939 --> 00:50:40,140
You can see that it makes them happy. 

497
00:51:13,508 --> 00:51:19,903
Hr. Heula. And this should Bianca. 
Welcome, come inside. 

498
00:51:28,898 --> 00:51:31,149
I have my boots, I 
My shoes not included. 

499
00:51:31,249 --> 00:51:34,432
Make you do not worry. 
Baxter, dear ... 

500
00:51:34,433 --> 00:51:38,113
Boys, this is my man. 

501
00:51:46,355 --> 00:51:48,238
How is it with you? 

502
00:51:48,707 --> 00:51:52,567
Is that for me Bianca? 
Thank you. 

503
00:51:54,929 --> 00:51:59,197
Can Baxter something to drink for you 
Retrieve, from the kitchen? 

504
00:52:13,963 --> 00:52:15,984
Beer? 

505
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:18,837
And Bianca? 

506
00:52:20,211 --> 00:52:21,969
She does not drink. 

507
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:25,851
It is also not like if I drink. 
But I assume there is one. 

508
00:52:29,422 --> 00:52:31,825
I can help you with your jackets. 

509
00:52:34,115 --> 00:52:36,741
This is Margo, this is Bianca. 

510
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,269
Hello, Bianca. 

511
00:52:44,593 --> 00:52:47,410
I am glad that you have that memo 
Circulated. I would have gone out of my roof. 

512
00:52:48,224 --> 00:52:50,528
It's so bizarre. 

513
00:52:50,529 --> 00:52:53,734
It is a disease. 
-- What a rare snuiter. 

514
00:52:56,024 --> 00:53:00,834
Look well to him. He is in love 
That sletterige piece silicone. 

515
00:53:01,764 --> 00:53:04,246
That is Bianca. 
-- Has he sex with her? 

516
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:06,642
Since it is meant for, yes. 

517
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:11,224
I hear that you are going to marry. 
-- Yes. -- No. 

518
00:53:24,356 --> 00:53:26,655
I would do a murder, 
She has her as such. 

519
00:53:26,656 --> 00:53:30,890
I would like it a bit. 
Long and short front from behind. 

520
00:53:31,001 --> 00:53:34,919
Lars would never want it 
Afknipte. Boys and long hair. 

521
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:39,253
That makes me no difference. 

522
00:53:39,795 --> 00:53:42,690
Where they hold, since I also love. 

523
00:53:43,537 --> 00:53:46,218
This is a man to my taste. 

524
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:49,296
I have a glass of wine. 

525
00:53:50,896 --> 00:53:52,660
I recall it well. 

526
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,302
Someone something? 
-- No, thanks. 

527
00:54:18,377 --> 00:54:21,886
Lars, Bianca is really a baby. 

528
00:54:21,887 --> 00:54:23,888
Thanks. 

529
00:54:23,889 --> 00:54:27,425
The best is yet, they do not know 
How horny they are. 

530
00:54:27,426 --> 00:54:29,320
That does you a woman. 

531
00:54:29,321 --> 00:54:32,095
They remain with you because they do not know 
That she is someone who can get better. 

532
00:54:32,096 --> 00:54:35,193
How is that possible? 

533
00:54:35,194 --> 00:54:38,279
Is it flexible? 

534
00:54:51,184 --> 00:54:53,079
Yes. 

535
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:14,282
Do you like? 

536
00:56:28,982 --> 00:56:31,614
I am so happy. 
That is the only. 

537
00:56:40,216 --> 00:56:44,038
And as he saw us, when we 
Small meadow went past. 

538
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:46,760
And we wrote and kerfden 
In the bark of the trees. 

539
00:56:46,761 --> 00:56:49,710
In the fine sand of the various mass. 

540
00:56:49,711 --> 00:56:53,965
All in harmony with sadness 
And summoned by the prayer of Dulcinea. 

541
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:15,640
But what he most sad 
Made was ... 

542
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:18,764
That there was no other hermit, 
Biecht for him to take. 

543
00:57:46,288 --> 00:57:47,954
Pain? 

544
00:57:48,649 --> 00:57:50,532
It is OK. 

545
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:53,178
That is good, that can 
I do. 

546
00:57:55,661 --> 00:57:58,593
You must be excited, 
That there is a baby. 

547
00:58:02,066 --> 00:58:04,301
Do not you uncle? 

548
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:17,589
Do you want to be a mother? 
-- I do not know. 

549
00:58:27,566 --> 00:58:29,838
Yes. 

550
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,713
But I never have children 
Can get. 

551
00:58:52,186 --> 00:58:54,006
Bianca is also true. 

552
00:59:01,153 --> 00:59:03,725
Yes, it is also unable to have children. 

553
00:59:03,726 --> 00:59:05,891
That is a pity. 

554
00:59:05,892 --> 00:59:10,659
When she was a baby, 
Her mother died, so ... 

555
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,700
When she was born. 

556
00:59:12,701 --> 00:59:15,392
Like that of you. 

557
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:19,505
You have a lot in common. 

558
00:59:28,002 --> 00:59:31,377
Lars, you know that we have a hope 
Learned ... 

559
00:59:31,378 --> 00:59:34,882
Since then. Things are better. 

560
00:59:34,883 --> 00:59:38,554
Yes, but it can still happen. 
-- That is highly unlikely. 

561
00:59:38,555 --> 00:59:42,112
That is rare. 

562
00:59:42,113 --> 00:59:44,283
Yes, but it would still can. 

563
00:59:49,273 --> 00:59:51,716
Take a breath. 

564
00:59:56,751 --> 00:59:58,784
It is good. 

565
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,871
I am sorry. 

566
01:00:01,872 --> 01:00:05,304
I am sorry. It's just as dangerous. 

567
01:00:05,305 --> 01:00:08,399
It is so dangerous. 
-- Sit down. 

568
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,666
Put your head between your knees. 
Sit down. 

569
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:18,391
Stop just your head between 
Your knees. Bend forward. 

570
01:00:24,269 --> 01:00:26,472
I am sorry. 
-- It is good. 

571
01:00:26,473 --> 01:00:28,681
Take a breath. 

572
01:00:39,276 --> 01:00:43,095
I hope that they are soft. 
You would have to be soft. 

573
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:50,392
We can all do what we want. 
You do all your things, and I am at work. 

574
01:00:58,663 --> 01:01:03,009
What do you think about in the afternoon? 
On Monday and Wednesday ... 

575
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:05,367
And then all day Saturday. 

576
01:01:12,478 --> 01:01:15,531
Yes, you know sure? 

577
01:01:15,632 --> 01:01:19,019
Bianca, do you think that good? 

578
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:23,361
Bianca wants as a volunteer in 
The hospital on Thursday afternoon. 

579
01:01:24,164 --> 01:01:26,895
Me too. 

580
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:29,851
And your blood pressure? 

581
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:34,031
Think of all those children. 
Would that not great? 

582
01:01:35,715 --> 01:01:38,287
That is true. 
-- Learn what layers, and then structure it ... 

583
01:01:38,288 --> 01:01:42,975
I do not know what you 
There thinking, but ... 

584
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,814
I find that fun. 
That looks sweet. 

585
01:01:49,813 --> 01:01:52,861
Are you sure. 
It grows no more. 

586
01:01:56,849 --> 01:02:00,226
<i> What's that for a sound? 
By Veronica, and Charles </ i>. 

587
01:02:00,227 --> 01:02:02,916
<i> I hear the phone. </ I> 

588
01:02:50,091 --> 01:02:52,503
He is no better, do you? 

589
01:02:55,318 --> 01:02:58,053
No, probably not. 

590
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:05,576
He will his entire life 
That thing, and ... 

591
01:03:05,577 --> 01:03:09,128
That's all my fault. 

592
01:03:11,313 --> 01:03:14,255
No, that's not it, it's ... 

593
01:03:14,256 --> 01:03:16,707
I do not know. 

594
01:03:16,708 --> 01:03:21,666
I mean, I am as soon as possible 
The house assumed. 

595
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:29,165
I have never thought of him. 
And then we have two. 

596
01:03:29,166 --> 01:03:31,844
We went to here, 
Entirely happy. 

597
01:03:31,845 --> 01:03:36,287
And he goes to the garage, 
Just like the family dog. 

598
01:03:39,197 --> 01:03:41,108
And I did that. 

599
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:46,588
No wonder that he is a fiancée 
In a box orders. 

600
01:03:50,485 --> 01:03:52,658
Come here.

601
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,674
We are up. 

602
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:12,311
What's going on? 

603
01:05:12,312 --> 01:05:15,683
There is a feast volunteers 
Of the hospital. At the V & W. 

604
01:05:15,684 --> 01:05:19,023
Does it not nice? 
-- It looks good. 

605
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:28,331
We were going scrabbelen. 

606
01:05:28,332 --> 01:05:30,342
Are you sure? 

607
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:34,066
Her calendar hangs on the refrigerator. 
Have you looked there? 

608
01:05:35,602 --> 01:05:38,534
No, I did not. I think 
Forget that I am. 

609
01:05:42,797 --> 01:05:45,758
Can I do a lot even with her 
Only, please. 

610
01:05:49,842 --> 01:05:51,980
Thank you. 

611
01:05:52,493 --> 01:05:54,103
Thank you. 

612
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,568
<i> You are my girlfriend. This would 
I do not need to look to the calendar ...</ i> 

613
01:06:02,569 --> 01:06:04,600
<i> To see what kind of plan you have. </ I> 

614
01:06:04,601 --> 01:06:06,109
<i> You speak something. </ I> 

615
01:06:07,562 --> 01:06:09,230
<i> You always have ten people around you. </ I> 

616
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:11,568
<i> Can not even own the phone 
Recording, and let me know? </ I> 

617
01:06:11,569 --> 01:06:13,036
They never quarrel. 

618
01:06:13,037 --> 01:06:15,310
<i> I am prepared to go to 
Scrabbelen ...</ i> 

619
01:06:15,311 --> 01:06:17,334
His tone is not me. 

620
01:06:23,366 --> 01:06:27,046
Listen now look at me. 
Bianca has a life of its own. 

621
01:06:27,047 --> 01:06:30,222
Not a woman with self-esteem 
You need to call ... 

622
01:06:30,223 --> 01:06:32,822
And the sooner you learn that the better. 
Yes? -- Yes. 

623
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:35,702
You are the whole day on the job, 
What should they do? 

624
01:06:35,703 --> 01:06:38,384
On you wait? Would you that 
It do? 

625
01:06:38,385 --> 01:06:40,774
Would they even ask you? 

626
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:44,998
She is outside in the community, 
Doing things for others, which are less ... 

627
01:06:44,999 --> 01:06:46,958
Fortunately than we do. 
You should be proud of her. 

628
01:06:46,959 --> 01:06:50,360
And I then? 
-- Large baby. 

629
01:06:50,361 --> 01:06:52,774
He is like my husband. 

630
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:55,148
We are at eleven o'clock at home. 

631
01:07:12,423 --> 01:07:15,744
She is my girlfriend. I should its agenda 
Not having to look to see her. 

632
01:07:20,045 --> 01:07:22,159
Is all well with you? 

633
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,772
How would they feel if 
I just went her way? 

634
01:07:27,865 --> 01:07:30,774
Her so would leave. 

635
01:07:30,775 --> 01:07:33,399
She has not abandoned you, 
She comes back. 

636
01:07:34,691 --> 01:07:37,661
And how do I know that? 

637
01:07:38,588 --> 01:07:41,990
People do what they want. 

638
01:07:42,601 --> 01:07:45,733
It may be they do not care. 
-- It may be what we all care. 

639
01:07:45,734 --> 01:07:47,885
Lars, what can we do care. 

640
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:51,175
No, you do not. 

641
01:07:51,563 --> 01:07:55,434
That is not true. 

642
01:07:58,184 --> 01:08:04,149
Everybody in the city is doing its utmost, 
Bianca so that feels good. 

643
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:08,133
Why do you think that they 
Go can go, and ... 

644
01:08:08,134 --> 01:08:10,192
So much to do. 

645
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:14,592
I do not know. 
-- That is because of you. 

646
01:08:14,593 --> 01:08:18,725
Because all those people of yours. 

647
01:08:18,726 --> 01:08:20,988
We push her wheelchair. 

648
01:08:20,989 --> 01:08:23,973
We drive her to work, 
We drive her home. 

649
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:27,165
We wash her, we dress her. 

650
01:08:27,166 --> 01:08:30,455
We help her stand up. 
We put her in bed. 

651
01:08:30,456 --> 01:08:32,100
We help her. 

652
01:08:32,101 --> 01:08:37,333
It is not small, Lars. 
Bianca is a big girl. 

653
01:08:38,587 --> 01:08:42,967
None of this is easy for us, 
But we do it. 

654
01:08:42,968 --> 01:08:48,350
We do it for you. 

655
01:08:50,813 --> 01:08:54,893
Dare me not to tell, 
That we are not included. 

656
01:09:09,032 --> 01:09:12,925
I think that the person who is upset should 
Say that he is upset ... 

657
01:09:12,926 --> 01:09:15,673
Because I can not ... 

658
01:09:17,713 --> 01:09:19,637
How was the game? 

659
01:09:21,456 --> 01:09:23,903
The kaascontroleurs have us 
Us Thursday. 

660
01:09:23,904 --> 01:09:28,080
Is everything okay? 
I put Bianca usually in bed. 

661
01:09:32,848 --> 01:09:36,520
I will tell you. 
We wanted them to talk with you. 

662
01:09:41,108 --> 01:09:43,960
You need that no longer do. 
I do that. 

663
01:09:43,961 --> 01:09:47,626
Are you sure? I think not 
Bad, and I thought that you ... 

664
01:09:51,171 --> 01:09:55,968
It is such a day. 
-- It is good. 

665
01:09:57,055 --> 01:09:59,106
It is up to you, and ... 

666
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:04,817
But I will leave you alone. 

667
01:10:05,269 --> 01:10:07,870
What is happening? 
-- Thank you. 

668
01:10:08,987 --> 01:10:11,729
I have done nothing. 
-- Yes, you have a lot. 

669
01:10:19,544 --> 01:10:21,887
I am tired. 

670
01:10:28,212 --> 01:10:31,543
Have I missed something? 
-- We had a big quarrel. 

671
01:10:31,544 --> 01:10:33,400
Really? 
-- Yes. 

672
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:47,214
Have you no palèniki, 
It is not so warm. 

673
01:10:47,431 --> 01:10:49,765
I think what the cold outside. 

674
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:58,439
Lars, have you already discovered Erik? 
-- Not officially. 

675
01:10:59,016 --> 01:11:01,149
You are very famous here. 

676
01:11:04,585 --> 01:11:06,669
It also provides a solid basis, size. 

677
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:39,608
Yes? 

678
01:11:51,969 --> 01:11:54,331
In my office? 

679
01:11:55,027 --> 01:11:57,648
I think I stay. 

680
01:11:57,649 --> 01:12:00,482
She feels good krute today. 

681
01:12:02,429 --> 01:12:04,712
That leaves us both. 

682
01:12:12,397 --> 01:12:15,868
I asked last week 
Or she wants to marry me. 

683
01:12:20,123 --> 01:12:22,746
Congratulations. 

684
01:12:23,497 --> 01:12:26,179
Where is the happy day? 

685
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:28,492
She has said no. 

686
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:34,236
I know. I could not believe it. 

687
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:50,497
<i> Stop it. You have the right not 
So to me talking. Are you not? </ I> 

688
01:12:50,498 --> 01:12:53,914
<i> No, you do not know. 
I am also not talking to you. </ I> 

689
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,450
<i> Shut up now with screaming? </ I> 

690
01:13:49,898 --> 01:13:52,596
I was talking to Bianca, and ... 

691
01:13:52,597 --> 01:13:56,205
And she said that in her culture, 
Written passages ... 

692
01:13:56,206 --> 01:13:59,312
Rituals and ceremonies, and ... 

693
01:13:59,313 --> 01:14:01,918
An awful lot of things that 
If you do ... 

694
01:14:01,919 --> 01:14:05,093
Or if you handle it finished. 
If you have doorleeft, you mature. 

695
01:14:07,107 --> 01:14:09,439
Sounds not that great. 

696
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,636
Yes, that is true. 

697
01:14:11,637 --> 01:14:13,832
How do you know that? 

698
01:14:13,933 --> 01:14:15,971
What do I know? 

699
01:14:15,972 --> 01:14:18,001
That you are a man. 

700
01:14:19,918 --> 01:14:22,340
No, I can not tell you. 

701
01:14:27,303 --> 01:14:29,148
Was it sex? 

702
01:14:41,752 --> 01:14:44,563
It is a kind of sex, 
But it's not ... 

703
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:48,922
I do not know, it's ... 

704
01:14:48,923 --> 01:14:50,810
A good question. 

705
01:14:50,811 --> 01:14:53,127
Yes, but I need to know. 

706
01:14:53,899 --> 01:14:56,143
Hold that thought. 

707
01:15:07,121 --> 01:15:09,123
You would have to ask to Dagmar. 

708
01:15:09,124 --> 01:15:12,410
I am referring to Dagmaar asked. 
She said that I had to ask it to you. 

709
01:15:15,925 --> 01:15:19,453
I can give you only my opinion. 
-- That I would also just. 

710
01:15:19,454 --> 01:15:21,634
It is not that you or one of 
The other are ... 

711
01:15:21,635 --> 01:15:24,932
There is still a child inside. 
But you grew up ... 

712
01:15:24,933 --> 01:15:26,442
If you decide that this is best. 

713
01:15:26,443 --> 01:15:29,141
And not only what is good for you, 
But what is good for everyone. 

714
01:15:29,142 --> 01:15:31,945
Even if it hurts. 

715
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:36,122
What then? 

716
01:15:38,062 --> 01:15:40,567
Like ... 

717
01:15:40,568 --> 01:15:46,492
You take people not in the leg, 
Deceiving you and your wife. 

718
01:15:46,493 --> 01:15:49,958
And you ensure your family, 
And you admits that you are wrong. 

719
01:15:49,959 --> 01:15:52,307
That try anyway. 

720
01:15:53,771 --> 01:15:56,517
That is all I can think of. 

721
01:15:56,518 --> 01:15:58,885
It sounds simple, but 
One way or another is that it is not. 

722
01:15:58,985 --> 01:16:00,992
I know. Because nothing is easy. 

723
01:16:01,566 --> 01:16:04,844
It's like those old, he required 
Not only for two children, ... 

724
01:16:04,845 --> 01:16:07,908
He had us to an orphanage 
Can bring people do that. 

725
01:16:07,943 --> 01:16:10,055
But he loved us, and he 
Tried to do the right ... 

726
01:16:10,056 --> 01:16:11,862
Even though he knew not how it was. 

727
01:16:11,863 --> 01:16:14,480
Even though his heart was broken. 

728
01:16:24,032 --> 01:16:27,083
I had you not only have to be with him. 

729
01:16:27,084 --> 01:16:29,734
He had too much pain, which made 
Scared me ... 

730
01:16:29,735 --> 01:16:33,701
And I am just weggerend. 

731
01:16:36,896 --> 01:16:39,216
That was egoïstisch. 

732
01:16:40,553 --> 01:16:42,777
And that I am sorry. 

733
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:50,648
That is not bad. 

734
01:16:59,135 --> 01:17:01,499
You are transferred stripe. 

735
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:05,608
You remained gappen my action figures. 
-- I blocked them, I do not hang on. 

736
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:08,472
What therefore Margo, you are 
Indeed too old for that thing. 

737
01:17:09,607 --> 01:17:12,593
Get that there sling. -- No. 
-- Get it. 

738
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:16,866
See's face, the bear is dead. 
Good for you. 

739
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:26,208
I warned her. 

740
01:17:43,623 --> 01:17:46,216
It is not just a beer. 

741
01:17:46,217 --> 01:17:49,165
I have been with Erik. 

742
01:17:56,833 --> 01:17:58,744
That I am sorry to hear. 

743
01:18:00,415 --> 01:18:03,264
Yes, I had not even 
A good reason. 

744
01:18:03,265 --> 01:18:05,771
He was not as interest. 

745
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:18,582
Why was he your boyfriend? 

746
01:18:21,948 --> 01:18:24,191
Because I was lonely. 

747
01:18:46,858 --> 01:18:48,773
Thank you. 

748
01:18:49,051 --> 01:18:51,035
Please. 

749
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:56,941
What are you doing Friday? 

750
01:19:00,074 --> 01:19:02,602
I have an appointment at 
The schoolcommissie. 

751
01:19:04,098 --> 01:19:06,231
Bianca is chosen, then ... 

752
01:19:06,232 --> 01:19:09,965
That's great. 

753
01:19:16,906 --> 01:19:18,540
Why? 

754
01:19:19,659 --> 01:19:23,628
I thought we might all 
Even once could. 

755
01:19:25,962 --> 01:19:28,046
Let it. 

756
01:19:28,047 --> 01:19:30,503
When I have disposed of Bianca, 
I am free. 

757
01:19:30,504 --> 01:19:33,233
But then I just, so ... 

758
01:19:37,527 --> 01:19:39,682
That would be great, Lars. 

759
01:19:40,843 --> 01:19:42,638
Thank you. 

760
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:11,340
Good roll. 

761
01:20:36,216 --> 01:20:40,719
You run the ball too much. 
-- I know. 

762
01:20:46,936 --> 01:20:49,675
Sorry, we are full. 
There is a large damestoernooi. 

763
01:20:49,964 --> 01:20:52,371
We are all guys. 
Let the ladies. 

764
01:20:52,372 --> 01:20:54,955
Really Nelson. 
She cracks me to pieces. 

765
01:20:55,834 --> 01:20:57,714
Is that Lars? 

766
01:20:59,559 --> 01:21:02,631
Hey, buddy. 
-- We are full. 

767
01:21:08,269 --> 01:21:12,358
Margo, you get a pack on your Thursday. 
-- Let me give you a pack on your Thursday. 

768
01:21:16,429 --> 01:21:18,545
Congratulations. 

769
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:38,986
This, I just needed. 

770
01:22:38,987 --> 01:22:42,299
Things look so much better off. 

771
01:22:43,403 --> 01:22:46,475
Thank you that you are with me 
Go bowling, Lars. 

772
01:23:06,435 --> 01:23:09,629
I do not at the wrong idea 
Bring ... 

773
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:12,185
Talking about. 

774
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:19,871
Bianca, I would never be able to cheat. 

775
01:23:21,305 --> 01:23:26,749
No, I do not hope that you 
Have thought, Lars. 

776
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:29,059
That I would never do. 

777
01:23:38,547 --> 01:23:41,181
That I would never do. 

778
01:23:44,969 --> 01:23:46,694
Good. 

779
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,091
A man deceives his wife not, 
And so as that. 

780
01:23:52,092 --> 01:23:55,389
Absolutely, and not vice versa. 

781
01:23:55,852 --> 01:24:00,191
Besides, I need nobody 
Friend to steal. 

782
01:24:00,192 --> 01:24:03,114
I will be a man I find themselves, and ... 

783
01:24:05,204 --> 01:24:06,928
We will also happy. 

784
01:24:09,362 --> 01:24:12,495
Yes, I think that it works. 

785
01:24:29,695 --> 01:24:32,570
Thank you. 

786
01:24:35,307 --> 01:24:37,551
Snow. 

787
01:24:43,076 --> 01:24:46,348
I hoped that the winter was over. 

788
01:24:46,643 --> 01:24:51,144
No, it is still autumn. 
Winter lasts until Easter. 

789
01:24:58,324 --> 01:25:00,733
Thanks again. 

790
01:25:29,515 --> 01:25:32,320
Good night, Lars. 

791
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:53,274
I am not sure if all 
These operations may work. 

792
01:25:53,275 --> 01:25:55,793
No? 

793
01:25:59,447 --> 01:26:01,601
What do you think? 

794
01:26:02,838 --> 01:26:05,038
I do not know. 

795
01:26:11,471 --> 01:26:13,872
I am sorry. 

796
01:26:22,937 --> 01:26:26,378
I do not know, it's difficult because ... 

797
01:26:27,851 --> 01:26:33,447
I know that it takes me. But I ask 
Her to marry me, and said says no. 

798
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:39,079
She says, I do not know. 

799
01:26:41,414 --> 01:26:43,764
Or they say nothing. 

800
01:26:48,681 --> 01:26:50,810
Nothing? 

801
01:26:58,416 --> 01:27:02,234
<i> When I was a child, 
I am talking as a child. </ I> 

802
01:27:02,235 --> 01:27:05,394
<i> I understood as a child. </ I> 

803
01:27:29,089 --> 01:27:31,448
Feels that good? 

804
01:28:08,609 --> 01:28:12,488
Waking up. 

805
01:28:16,148 --> 01:28:18,113
They do not want to wake up. 

806
01:28:18,698 --> 01:28:22,713
I think she was unconscious. 
Are you sure? -- Look me up. 

807
01:28:25,852 --> 01:28:29,193
Bianca is unconscious. 
-- Can you hear me? 

808
01:28:32,668 --> 01:28:34,533
Waking up. 

809
01:28:34,534 --> 01:28:37,516
It seems to go well with her. 

810
01:28:37,574 --> 01:28:39,608
Call 911. 

811
01:28:44,848 --> 01:28:48,383
I do not know. Why you expect 
I know what I should do? 

812
01:28:57,663 --> 01:29:00,257
They are there, call Dr. Birnman. 

813
01:29:12,174 --> 01:29:14,438
I am sorry, you will have to wait here. 

814
01:29:17,123 --> 01:29:19,503
The doctor is now underway. 

815
01:29:35,614 --> 01:29:37,309
What? 

816
01:29:39,985 --> 01:29:41,991
What? 

817
01:29:42,614 --> 01:29:45,347
Bianca is very sick. 

818
01:29:46,617 --> 01:29:49,908
No, that's not it. 
Come on, she's not sick. 

819
01:29:49,909 --> 01:29:52,288
That it is not. 

820
01:29:54,823 --> 01:29:57,037
She is dead. 

821
01:29:59,886 --> 01:30:03,088
We keep her here until 
It is stable, but ... 

822
01:30:03,089 --> 01:30:05,965
Lars they want to bring home tonight. 

823
01:30:05,966 --> 01:30:09,012
Can I see her. 
-- Sure. 

824
01:30:32,275 --> 01:30:34,038
What? 

825
01:30:53,855 --> 01:30:56,924
I am sorry, but I just do not get the picture. 

826
01:30:56,925 --> 01:31:01,712
I mean, what will the impact on him. 
How can you let this happen? 

827
01:31:01,713 --> 01:31:06,086
I let this not happen, it's Lars. 
It is always Lars. 

828
01:31:07,196 --> 01:31:11,862
He makes the decisions. 
He found her unconscious. 

829
01:31:11,863 --> 01:31:14,363
He is the one who says that they are dead. 

830
01:31:27,087 --> 01:31:29,750
Is everything back there with you? 

831
01:31:29,751 --> 01:31:33,141
They have given her something, 
So she sleeps. 

832
01:31:34,249 --> 01:31:36,972
Is there something that you want, Lars? 

833
01:31:41,665 --> 01:31:45,396
I want her to continue tonight 
In the pink room. 

834
01:33:31,331 --> 01:33:36,546
Come down to the living room, Lars. 
Let Bianca rest. 

835
01:33:45,044 --> 01:33:48,204
We have to Gus and Karin 
The film. 

836
01:33:48,205 --> 01:33:51,693
They wanted not only you. 

837
01:33:56,661 --> 01:34:00,780
I am glad that they have done. 
I am pleased that they have gone away. 

838
01:34:00,781 --> 01:34:04,628
I feel terrible that this all 
Happen, just when the baby is already so soon. 

839
01:34:04,629 --> 01:34:08,315
It is life, Lars. 
Everything comes at a time. 

840
01:34:08,316 --> 01:34:11,157
We have a stoofschotel included. 

841
01:34:11,719 --> 01:34:13,583
Thank you. 

842
01:34:21,467 --> 01:34:25,433
Is there anything that I should do now? 
-- No, dear. 

843
01:34:25,434 --> 01:34:27,635
Ga but you eat. 

844
01:34:27,636 --> 01:34:30,165
We came here only to 
Trapped. 

845
01:34:30,166 --> 01:34:32,750
That is what people do when 
There is a tragedy strikes. 

846
01:34:32,751 --> 01:34:35,470
Then they go, and 
They are going to sit there. 

847
01:34:40,711 --> 01:34:43,264
Feel you you are not a little better? 

848
01:35:02,281 --> 01:35:06,607
I have the lentekoorts we go to the lake. 
Would you also coming? 

849
01:35:15,037 --> 01:35:17,978
Lars, why will you not be with us? 

850
01:35:17,979 --> 01:35:19,781
That will be all good. 

851
01:35:26,921 --> 01:35:32,045
Bianca, you want this beautiful day? 

852
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:48,951
Is there a storm is coming? 
-- The weather forecast said not. 

853
01:35:52,126 --> 01:35:55,448
It seems to me according to a storm. 

854
01:35:55,449 --> 01:35:58,814
I have even stretch my legs. 

855
01:35:58,815 --> 01:36:01,070
Let the gambling but car. 

856
01:36:11,358 --> 01:36:14,356
I think we have to the water 
Continue to watch. 

857
01:36:14,630 --> 01:36:16,400
We are not far away. 

858
01:36:16,805 --> 01:36:19,470
Call us if you need it. 

859
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:09,944
Think you that by driving? 

860
01:38:09,945 --> 01:38:11,932
I do not know? Is that 
Not in pregnant women? 

861
01:38:12,109 --> 01:38:16,466
I believe it. Make careful. 

862
01:38:28,432 --> 01:38:31,056
Not run. 

863
01:39:00,147 --> 01:39:03,958
Lars has asked us to 
Not to wear black today. 

864
01:39:03,959 --> 01:39:10,686
That he has done to us to 
Remember that this is no ordinary funeral. 

865
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:18,217
We are here to Bianca's 
Special live comfortably. 

866
01:39:19,866 --> 01:39:25,701
From her wheelchair, Bianca
reached out and touched us all. 

867
01:39:25,702 --> 01:39:30,282
In a way that we never had 
May propose. 

868
01:39:31,804 --> 01:39:34,206
She was a teacher. 

869
01:39:36,342 --> 01:39:40,040
It was a lesson in courage. 

870
01:39:44,664 --> 01:39:47,086
And Bianca loved us all. 

871
01:39:48,301 --> 01:39:50,920
Especially Lars. 

872
01:39:53,258 --> 01:39:55,512
Especially from him. 

873
01:40:42,355 --> 01:40:46,244
Is all well with you? 
-- Yes, I am sorry, I ... 

874
01:40:46,245 --> 01:40:51,314
It is ... Funerals, and mama and papa ... 

875
01:40:58,964 --> 01:41:03,612
He's incredible, huh? 
-- Yes. 

876
01:41:08,189 --> 01:41:13,091
I wanted to thank you for ... 

877
01:41:30,122 --> 01:41:33,810
Will I see you at our house? 
-- Sure. 

878
01:42:04,267 --> 01:42:08,178
They asked me not to be sad. 
But I can not do anything about it. 

879
01:42:11,638 --> 01:42:14,204
Yes, I do not. 

880
01:42:16,446 --> 01:42:19,616
But it will be over for a while 
Be better. 

881
01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:24,131
That tells everyone, so ... 

882
01:42:25,589 --> 01:42:29,388
I think it is in any way 
True. 

883
01:42:33,473 --> 01:42:36,956
But there will never be someone 
As they are. 

884
01:42:59,326 --> 01:43:02,894
I think I ... 

885
01:43:02,895 --> 01:43:06,170
To all the other should take. 

886
01:43:11,987 --> 01:43:15,148
Would you like a eindje walk? 

887
01:43:16,591 --> 01:43:18,345
Yes. 

888
01:43:32,442 --> 01:43:36,085
