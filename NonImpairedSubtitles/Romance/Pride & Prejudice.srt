My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard?

5
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:58,370
Netherfield Park is let at last. Do you
not want to know who has taken it?.

6
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:04,296
As you wish to tell me, my dear,
I doubt I have any choice in the matter.

7
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,891
Kitty, what have I told you
about listening at the door?.

8
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:15,776
There's a Mr Bingley
arrived from the North.

9
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,048
- Five thousand a year!
- Really?.

10
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,812
- He's single!
- Who's single?.

11
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:23,546
A Mr Bingley, apparently. Kitty!

12
00:03:23,777 --> 00:03:25,523
How can that possibly affect them?.

13
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:27,755
Mr Bennet,
how can you be so tiresome?.

14
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:30,188
You know he must marry one of them.

15
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:32,317
That is his design in settling here?.

16
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:34,632
You must go and visit him at once.

17
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:37,616
Good heavens. People.

18
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:43,857
For we may not visit if you do not,
as you well know, Mr Bennet.

19
00:03:44,135 --> 00:03:48,060
- Are you listening?. You never listen.
- You must, Papa! At once!

20
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:50,699
There's no need. I already have.

21
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:53,241
- You have?.
- When?.

22
00:03:53,454 --> 00:03:56,793
Oh, Mr Bennet,
how can you tease me so?.

23
00:03:57,094 --> 00:03:59,305
Have you no compassion
for my poor nerves?.

24
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,911
You mistake me, my dear.
I have the highest respect for them.

25
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:06,241
They've been my constant companions
these twenty years.

00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:07,420
Papa!

27
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:08,811
- Is he amiable?.
- Who?.

28
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:11,222
- Is he handsome?.
- He's sure to be.

29
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:14,443
With 5,000 a year,
it would not matter if he had warts.

30
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:15,972
Who's got warts?.

31
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:19,200
I will consent to
his marrying whichever girl he chooses.

32
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:23,415
- So will he come to the ball tomorrow?.
- I believe so.

33
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,301
- Mr Bennet!
- [Kitty] I have to have your muslin!

34
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:31,211
- I'll lend you my green slippers!
- They were mine.

35
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:34,943
- I'll do your mending for a week.
- I'll retrim your new bonnet.

00:04:35,248 --> 00:04:36,839
Two weeks I'll do it for.

If every man does not end the evening
in love with you,

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,148
then I'm no judge of beauty.

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,197
- Or men.
- No, they are far too easy to judge.

They're not all bad.

Humourless poppycocks,
in my limited experience.

One day,
someone will catch your eye,

00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,610
and then you'll have
to watch your tongue.

How good of you to come.

Which of the painted peacocks
is our Mr Bingley?.

He's on the right.
On the left is his sister.

00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:30,614
- The person with the quizzical brow?.
- That is his good friend, Mr Darcy.

52
00:06:30,954 --> 00:06:35,034
- He looks miserable, poor soul.
- He may be, but poor he is not.

Tell me.

54
00:06:36,473 --> 00:06:39,037
1 0,000 a year,
and he owns half of Derbyshire.

Mrs Bennet, Miss Jane Bennet,
Elizabeth and Miss Mary Bennet.

It is a pleasure. I have two others,
but they're already dancing.

I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.

And may I introduce Mr Darcy
of Pemberley in Derbyshire.

How do you like it
here in Hertfordshire?.

00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:14,445
Very much.

67
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,767
The library at Netherfield,
I've heard, is one of the finest.

68
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:22,177
It fills me with guilt. I'm not a good
reader. I prefer being out of doors.

69
00:08:22,498 --> 00:08:24,863
Oh, I mean, I can read, of course.

70
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:28,322
And I'm not suggesting
you can't read out of doors.

[Jane] I wish I read more, but there
seem to be so many other things to do.

[Bingley] That's exactly what I meant.

Mama, Mama! You will never, ever believe
what we're about to tell you.

- The regiment are coming!
- Officers?.

They're going to be stationed
the whole winter, right here.

00:08:49,856 --> 00:08:52,221
- Officers?.
- As far as the eye can see.

[Mrs Bennet] Oh, look.
Jane's dancing with Mr Bingley.

Mr Bennet.

- Do you dance, Mr Darcy?.
- Not if I can help it.

00:09:39,488 --> 00:09:42,362
I didn't know you were coming
to see me. What's the matter?.

We are a long way from Grosvenor Square,
are we not, Mr Darcy?.

00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:50,303
I've never seen so many pretty girls.

84
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:52,856
You were dancing
with the only handsome girl.

85
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:55,884
She is the most beautiful creature
I have ever beheld.

86
00:09:56,127 --> 00:10:00,207
- But her sister Elizabeth is agreeable.
- Perfectly tolerable.

87
00:10:00,486 --> 00:10:04,488
Not handsome enough to tempt me. Return
to your partner and enjoy her smiles.

[Darcy]
You're wasting your time with me.

Count your blessings, Lizzie. If he
liked you, you'd have to talk to him.

Precisely.

91
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:19,405
I wouldn't dance with him
for all of Derbyshire,

92

- I enjoyed that so much, Miss Lucas.
- How well you dance, Mr Bingley.

00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:47,206
[woman]
I've never enjoyed a dance so much.

97
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:50,114
My daughter Jane
is a splendid dancer, is she not?.

98
00:11:50,351 --> 00:11:52,175
She is indeed.

99
00:11:53,151 --> 00:11:56,180
Your friend Miss Lucas
is a most amusing young woman.

100
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:58,023
Oh, yes, I adore her.

101
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,110
- It is a pity she's not more handsome.
- Mama!

102
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,652
Oh, but Lizzie
would never admit that she's plain.

103
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,868
Of course, it's my Jane who's considered
the beauty of the county.

104
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,078
Mama, please!

105
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,184
When she was 1 5, a gentleman
was so much in love with her,

106
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:16,485
I was sure he would make her an offer.

107
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:20,047
However, he did write her
some very pretty verses.

108
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:21,467
And that put paid to it.

109
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:24,851
I wonder who discovered the power
of poetry in driving away love.

110
00:12:25,147 --> 00:12:28,254
- I thought poetry was the food of love.
- Of a fine, stout love.

111
00:12:28,507 --> 00:12:31,769
But if it is only a vague inclination,
one poor sonnet will kill it.

112
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:34,864
So, what do you recommend
to encourage affection?.

113
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:41,462
Dancing. Even if one's partner
is barely tolerable.

114
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:06,404
[hushed] Mr Bingley is just what
a young man ought to be.

115
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:09,924
- Sensible, good-humoured...
- Handsome, conveniently rich...

116
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:12,823
Marriage should not be driven
by thoughts of money.

117
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:15,117
Only deep love
will persuade me to marry.

118
00:13:15,381 --> 00:13:19,693
- Which is why I'll end up an old maid.
- Do you really believe he liked me?.

119
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,242
He danced with you most of the night,
and stared at you the rest.

120
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,297
I give you leave to like him.
You've liked many stupider.

121
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:29,608
You're a great deal too apt
to like people in general.

122
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:31,683
All the world
is good in your eyes.

123
00:13:31,938 --> 00:13:34,967
Not his friend. I still can't believe
what he said about you.

124
00:13:35,258 --> 00:13:37,469
Mr Darcy?.

125
00:13:37,698 --> 00:13:42,165
I'd more easily forgive his vanity
had he not wounded mine.

126
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:45,054
But no matter.
I doubt we shall ever speak again.

127
00:14:15,373 --> 00:14:17,351
[Mrs Bennet] He danced with Miss Lucas.

128
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:19,318
[Mr Bennet] We were all there, dear.

129
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:21,509
It is a shame she's not more handsome.

130
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:24,296
There's a spinster
in the making and no mistake.

131
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:27,019
The fourth with a Miss King
of little standing,

132
00:14:27,252 --> 00:14:29,230
and the fifth again with Jane.

133
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:32,520
If he had any compassion,
he would've sprained his ankle.

134
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:33,854
The way you carry on,

135
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,924
you'd think our girls look forward
to a grand inheritance.

136
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,303
When you die,
which may be very soon,

137
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:43,764
they will be left without a roof over
their head nor a penny to their name.

138
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,388
- Please, it's ten in the morning.
- A letter to Miss Bennet, ma'am.

139
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:50,911
From Netherfield Hall.

140
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,624
- Praise the Lord. We are saved!

[Mrs Bennet] Make haste, Jane,
make haste. Oh, happy day!

142
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:03,492
It is from Caroline Bingley.

143
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:08,155
She has invited me to dine with her.

144
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:11,321
- Her brother will be dining out.
- Dining out?.

145
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:13,390
- Can I take the carriage?.
- Let me see.

146
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:17,062
- It is too far to walk.
- This is unaccountable of him.

147
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:19,111
Mama, the carriage for Jane?.

148
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:24,544
Certainly not. She'll go on horseback.

149
00:15:25,364 --> 00:15:27,497
[Lizzie & Jane] Horseback!

Now she'll have to stay the night,
exactly as I predicted.

00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:50,552
Good grief, woman,
your skills in the art of matchmaking

154
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,546
are positively occult.

155
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,072
Though I don't think, Mama,
you can take credit for making it rain.

156
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,140
"My friends will not hear of me
returning home until I am better.

157
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:09,200
Excepting a sore throat, a fever and
a headache, nothing is wrong with me."

158
00:16:09,478 --> 00:16:14,331
If Jane does die it will be a comfort
to know it was in pursuit of Mr Bingley.

159
00:16:14,677 --> 00:16:16,810
People do not die of colds.

160
00:16:17,037 --> 00:16:20,221
[Lizzie] But she may perish with the
shame of having such a mother.

161
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,961
I must go to Netherfield at once.

162
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:41,293
Lady Bathurst is redecorating
her ballroom in the French style.

163
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,584
A little unpatriotic, don't you think?.

164
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:49,831
Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

165
00:17:03,071 --> 00:17:05,127
[Caroline] Good Lord, did you walk here?.

166
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:07,270
I did.

167
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:18,106
- I'm so sorry. How is my sister?.
- She's upstairs.

168
00:17:20,348 --> 00:17:22,172
Thank you.

169
00:17:31,347 --> 00:17:35,892
[Caroline] My goodness, did you
see her hem?. Six inches deep in mud.

170
00:17:36,227 --> 00:17:38,205
She looked positively mediaeval.

171
00:17:38,426 --> 00:17:42,661
I feel such a terrible imposition.
They're being so kind to me.

172
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:48,153
I don't know who is more pleased at your
being here, Mama or Mr Bingley.

173
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:55,549
Thank you for tending
to my sister so diligently.

174
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,957
She's in far better comfort
than at home.

175
00:17:58,183 --> 00:17:59,774
It's a pleasure.

176
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:03,594
I mean, it's not a pleasure
that she's ill. Of course not.

177
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,474
It's a pleasure that she's here,
being ill.

178
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,755
[Mr Bennet]
Not going to be famous, our pig.

179
00:18:12,982 --> 00:18:16,089
Black on the back, but not related
to the learned pig of Norwich.

180
00:18:16,382 --> 00:18:19,256
- Now that pig is...
- Mr Bennet.

181
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:22,608
It's all going to plan.
He's half in love with her already.

182
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,957
- Who is, blossom?.
- Mr Bingley.

183
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,353
He doesn't mind
that she hasn't a penny.

184
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,676
He has more than enough
for the two of them.

185
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:31,763
- How will we meet them?.
- Easy!

186
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:32,984
Wait for me!

187
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:38,231
[Lydia] You drop something. They
pick it up. And then you're introduced.

188
00:18:45,698 --> 00:18:46,703
Officers!

189
00:18:46,897 --> 00:18:49,417
[# military march]

190
00:19:17,693 --> 00:19:20,800
[Caroline]
You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.

191
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,993
You're mistaken. I write slowly.

192
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:26,591
How many letters you must have occasion
to write, Mr Darcy.

193
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:29,527
Letters of business.
How odious I should think them.

194
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:32,446
It is fortunate, then,
they fall to me and not you.

195
00:19:32,691 --> 00:19:35,056
Tell your sister I long to see her.

196
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:38,439
- I've already told her once.
- I do dote on her.

197
00:19:38,691 --> 00:19:41,720
I was quite in raptures
at her beautiful design for a table.

198
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,999
Perhaps you will give me leave
to defer your raptures.

199
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,228
I have not room enough
to do them justice.

200
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:50,131
[Bingley]
You young ladies are so accomplished.

201
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:53,631
- What do you mean?.
- You paint tables, play the piano

202
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:55,203
and embroider cushions.

203
00:19:55,408 --> 00:19:58,359
I never heard of a lady,
but people say she's accomplished.

204
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:00,704
[Darcy]
The word is applied too liberally.

205
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,945
I do not know more than
half a dozen women

206
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:05,764
- that are truly accomplished.
- [Caroline] Nor l.

207
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:08,958
Goodness, you must comprehend
a great deal in the idea.

208
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,720
- I do.
- Absolutely.

209
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:14,382
She must have a knowledge of music,
singing, drawing, dancing

210
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:17,752
and the modern languages
to deserve the word.

211
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:21,617
And something in her air
and manner of walking.

212
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:24,600
And she must improve her mind
by extensive reading.

213
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:28,339
I'm no longer surprised at your knowing
only six accomplished women.

214
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:31,711
- I wonder at you knowing any.
- Are you so severe on your own sex?.

215
00:20:32,003 --> 00:20:36,161
I never saw such a woman. She would
certainly be a fearsome thing to behold.

216
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:41,865
[Caroline] Miss Elizabeth,
let us take a turn about the room.

217
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:02,870
It's refreshing, is it not,
after sitting so long in one attitude?.

218
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,229
It is a small kind of accomplishment,
I suppose.

219
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:08,535
Will you not join us, Mr Darcy?.

220
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,061
You can only have two motives,
and I would interfere with either.

221
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:14,258
What can he mean?.

222
00:21:14,478 --> 00:21:17,507
The surest way to disappoint him
would be to ask him nothing.

223
00:21:17,797 --> 00:21:20,361
Do tell us, Mr Darcy.

224
00:21:22,437 --> 00:21:24,570
Either you are
in each other's confidence

225
00:21:24,796 --> 00:21:26,774
and you have
secret affairs to discuss,

226
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,092
or you are conscious
that your figures

227
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:32,307
appear to the greatest
advantage by walking.

228
00:21:33,796 --> 00:21:36,393
If the first,
I should get in your way.

229
00:21:36,635 --> 00:21:39,354
If the second,
I can admire you much better from here.

230
00:21:39,595 --> 00:21:41,806
How shall we punish him
for such a speech?.

231
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:45,805
- We could laugh at him.
- No. Mr Darcy is not to be teased.

232
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:50,463
Are you too proud, Mr Darcy?. And would
you consider pride a fault or a virtue?.

233
00:21:50,753 --> 00:21:53,550
- I couldn't say.
- We're trying to find a fault in you.

234
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,707
I find it hard to forgive
the follies and vices of others,

235
00:21:56,953 --> 00:21:58,622
or their offences against me.

236
00:21:58,873 --> 00:22:02,135
My good opinion,
once lost, is lost forever.

237
00:22:04,112 --> 00:22:07,063
Oh, dear.
I cannot tease you about that.

238
00:22:07,311 --> 00:22:09,289
What a shame,
for I dearly love to laugh.

239
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:11,607
[Caroline] A family trait, I think.

240
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:44,119
A Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet,
a Miss Bennet and a Miss Bennet, sir.

241
00:22:44,426 --> 00:22:47,223
Are we to receive every
Bennet in the country?.

242
00:22:49,906 --> 00:22:53,013
What an excellent room you have, sir.

243
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:56,681
Such expensive furnishings.

244
00:22:56,945 --> 00:22:59,742
[Mrs Bennet] I do hope
you intend to stay here, Mr Bingley.

245
00:23:00,024 --> 00:23:04,491
Absolutely, I find the country
very diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?.

246
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,374
I find it perfectly adequate.

247
00:23:06,623 --> 00:23:09,298
Even if society
is a little less varied than in town.

248
00:23:09,543 --> 00:23:11,289
Less varied?. Not at all.

249
00:23:11,543 --> 00:23:15,313
We dine with four and 20 families
of all shapes and sizes.

250
00:23:15,582 --> 00:23:19,740
Sir William Lucas, for instance,
is a very agreeable man.

251
00:23:20,062 --> 00:23:23,556
And a good deal less self-important
than some people half his rank.

252
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,277
[Lydia] Mr Bingley,
is it true you will hold a ball here?.

253
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:28,977
A ball?.

254
00:23:29,181 --> 00:23:33,570
It would be an excellent way to meet new
friends. You could invite the militia.

255
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,724
- Oh, do hold a ball!
- Kitty!

256
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:38,619
When your sister recovers,
you shall name the day.

257
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:43,094
I think a ball is an irrational way
to gain new acquaintance.

258
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:47,266
It would be better if conversation,
not dancing, were the order of the day.

259
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:51,386
Indeed, much more rational,
but rather less like a ball.

260
00:23:51,658 --> 00:23:53,171
Thank you, Mary.

261
00:23:54,258 --> 00:23:58,260
What a fine imposing place to be sure,
is it not, my dears?.

262
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:01,645
There's no house
to equal it in the county.

263
00:24:01,936 --> 00:24:03,527
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Bennet.

264
00:24:03,736 --> 00:24:06,378
- There she is.
- I don't know how to thank you.

265
00:24:06,616 --> 00:24:09,258
You're welcome any time
you feel the least bit poorly.

266
00:24:09,494 --> 00:24:12,445
Thank you for your stimulating company.
Most instructive.

267
00:24:12,695 --> 00:24:16,034
Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.

268
00:24:18,694 --> 00:24:20,518
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Elizabeth.

269
00:24:32,492 --> 00:24:37,114
And then there was one
with great long lashes, like a cow.

270
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,974
Ask Mrs Hill
to order us a sirloin, Betsy.

271
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:43,395
Just the one, mind.
We're not made of money.

272
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,590
[Mary practises scales]

273
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:49,498
I hope, my dear,
you've ordered a good dinner today.

274
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:53,381
I've reason to expect
an addition to our family party.

275
00:24:53,689 --> 00:24:56,253
[Lizzie] His name's Mr Collins,
the dreaded cousin.

276
00:24:56,489 --> 00:24:58,778
- [Charlotte] Who is to inherit?.
- Everything.

277
00:24:59,048 --> 00:25:01,690
Even my piano stool
belongs to Mr Collins.

278
00:25:01,928 --> 00:25:02,856
When?.

279
00:25:03,088 --> 00:25:05,885
He may turn us out of the house
as soon as he pleases.

280
00:25:06,168 --> 00:25:09,197
The estate passes directly to him
and not to us poor females.

281
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:16,543
Mr Collins, at your service.

282
00:25:25,605 --> 00:25:29,253
What a superbly featured room
and what excellent potatoes.

283
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:34,207
It's many years since
I've had such an exemplary vegetable.

284
00:25:34,483 --> 00:25:38,485
To which fair cousin should I compliment
the excellence of the cooking?.

285
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,092
We are perfectly able to keep a cook.

286
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:43,147
Excellent.

287
00:25:43,363 --> 00:25:46,547
I'm very pleased
the estate can afford such a living.

288
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:53,225
I'm honoured to have as my patroness
Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

289
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:55,923
You've heard of her, I presume?.

290
00:25:56,162 --> 00:25:59,888
My small rectory abuts her estate,

291
00:26:00,161 --> 00:26:02,648
Rosings Park,
and she often condescends

292
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,320
to drive by my humble dwelling
in her little phaeton and ponies.

293
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,153
Does she have any family?.

294
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:14,557
One daughter, the heiress of Rosings
and very extensive property.

295
00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:16,857
I've often observed to Lady Catherine

296
00:26:17,078 --> 00:26:19,952
that her daughter
seemed born to be a duchess,

297
00:26:20,238 --> 00:26:25,601
for she has all the superior graces
of elevated rank.

298
00:26:25,957 --> 00:26:29,451
These kind of compliments
are always acceptable to the ladies,

299
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:33,758
and which I conceive myself
particularly bound to pay.

300
00:26:34,036 --> 00:26:36,401
How happy for you, Mr Collins,

301
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,975
to possess the talent for flattering
with such delicacy.

302
00:26:42,075 --> 00:26:45,337
Do these attentions proceed
from the impulse of the moment

303
00:26:45,595 --> 00:26:47,884
or are they
the result of previous study?.

304
00:26:48,154 --> 00:26:50,519
They arise
from what is passing at the time.

305
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:54,873
And though I do sometimes amuse myself
with arranging such little compliments,

306
00:26:55,194 --> 00:26:58,533
I always wish to give them
as unstudied an air as possible.

307
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:02,635
Oh, believe me, no one would suspect
your manners to be rehearsed.

308
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,786
[Lydia laughs, coughs]

309
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:12,454
After dinner, I thought
I might read to you for an hour or two.

310
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,507
I have with me Fordyce's Sermons

311
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:19,909
which speak very eloquently
on all matters moral.

312
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:24,310
Are you familiar with Fordyce's Sermons,
Miss Bennet?.

313
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:33,811
Mrs Bennet, I have been bestowed by the
good grace of Lady Catherine de Bourgh

314
00:27:34,108 --> 00:27:36,397
a parsonage of no mean size.

315
00:27:36,628 --> 00:27:38,606
I have become aware of the fact.

316
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:42,516
It is my avowed hope
that soon I may find a mistress for it.

317
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:45,971
And I have to inform you
that the eldest Miss Bennet

318
00:27:46,227 --> 00:27:49,798
has captured my special attention.

319
00:27:50,106 --> 00:27:52,626
Oh, Mr Collins.

320
00:27:52,865 --> 00:27:56,712
Unfortunately, it is incumbent upon me

321
00:27:56,986 --> 00:28:02,813
to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet
is very soon to be engaged.

322
00:28:03,145 --> 00:28:04,383
Engaged.

323
00:28:04,585 --> 00:28:06,874
But Miss Lizzie,
next to her in age and beauty,

324
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:10,328
would make anyone an excellent partner.

325
00:28:10,584 --> 00:28:14,354
Do not you agree?. Mr Collins?.

326
00:28:14,624 --> 00:28:18,704
Indeed. Indeed.

327
00:28:19,023 --> 00:28:21,312
A very agreeable alternative.

328
00:28:36,701 --> 00:28:38,292
[fiddler plays]

329
00:28:42,499 --> 00:28:45,838
[Lizzie] Mr Collins is a man who
makes you despair at the entire sex.

330
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:50,101
- Yours, I believe.
- Oh, Mr Wickham, how perfect you are.

331
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:53,370
He picked up my handkerchief.
Did you drop yours on purpose?.

332
00:28:53,618 --> 00:28:54,977
Mr Wickham is a lieutenant.

333
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:57,821
- An enchanted lieutenant.
- What are you up to, Liddy?.

334
00:28:58,056 --> 00:29:00,930
- We happened to be looking for ribbon.
- White, for the ball.

335
00:29:01,217 --> 00:29:03,582
Shall we all look
for some ribbon together?.

336
00:29:06,656 --> 00:29:09,840
- Good afternoon, Mr James.
- Miss Lydia, Miss Bennet.

337
00:29:10,136 --> 00:29:11,528
I shan't even browse.

338
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:14,300
I can't be trusted.
I have poor taste in ribbons.

339
00:29:14,536 --> 00:29:16,901
Only a truly confident man
would admit that.

340
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:18,494
No, it's true.

341
00:29:18,695 --> 00:29:21,646
And buckles.
When it comes to buckles, I'm lost.

342
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:25,078
- You must be the shame of the regiment.
- The laughing stock.

343
00:29:25,374 --> 00:29:28,248
What do your superiors do with you?.

344
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:33,658
Ignore me. I'm of next to no importance,
so it's easily done.

345
00:29:34,893 --> 00:29:37,844
- Lizzie, lend me some money.
- You already owe me a fortune.

346
00:29:38,772 --> 00:29:42,111
- Allow me to oblige.
- No, Mr Wickham, please...

347
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,583
I insist.

348
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,564
- [Lizzie] I pity the French.
- [wickham] So do l.

349
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:58,296
- [Jane] Look, Mr Bingley.
- [Lydia] Mr Bingley!

350
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:00,585
[Bingley]
I was just on my way to your house.

351
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,724
How do you like
my ribbons for your ball?.

352
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:07,193
- Very beautiful.
- She is. Look, she's blooming.

353
00:30:07,448 --> 00:30:08,961
Oh, Lydia.

354
00:30:09,209 --> 00:30:12,548
Be sure to invite Mr Wickham.
He is a credit to his profession.

355
00:30:12,807 --> 00:30:15,914
[Jane] You can't invite people
to other people's balls.

356
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,623
Of course, you must come, Mr Wickham.

357
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:23,004
If you'll excuse me,
ladies, enjoy the day.

358
00:30:25,686 --> 00:30:28,715
[Lizzie] Do you plan to go
to the Netherfield ball, Mr Wickham?.

359
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:34,129
Perhaps. How long
has Mr Darcy been a guest there?.

360
00:30:34,444 --> 00:30:36,190
About a month.

361
00:30:36,404 --> 00:30:41,568
Forgive me, but are you
acquainted with him, with Mr Darcy?.

362
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:45,886
Indeed, I've been connected
with his family since infancy.

363
00:30:46,204 --> 00:30:50,749
You may well be surprised,
given our cold greeting this afternoon.

364
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:56,824
I hope your plans in favour
of Meryton will not be affected

365
00:30:57,082 --> 00:31:00,852
- by your relations with the gentleman.
- It is not for me to be driven away.

366
00:31:01,122 --> 00:31:05,744
If he wishes to avoid seeing me,
he must go, not l.

367
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,392
I must ask, what is the manner
of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?.

368
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,551
My father managed his estate.

369
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,791
We grew up together, Darcy and l.

370
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:25,635
His father treated me like a second son,
loved me like a son.

371
00:31:25,998 --> 00:31:28,287
We were both with him the day he died.

372
00:31:30,277 --> 00:31:32,023
With his last breath,

373
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:35,188
his father bequeathed me
the rectory in his estate.

374
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,815
He knew I had my heart set
on joining the Church.

375
00:31:39,076 --> 00:31:42,183
But Darcy ignored his wishes
and gave the living to another man.

376
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:45,072
- But why?.
- Jealousy.

377
00:31:47,076 --> 00:31:49,518
His father...

378
00:31:49,755 --> 00:31:52,629
Well, he loved me better
and Darcy couldn't stand it.

379
00:31:53,755 --> 00:31:56,242
- How cruel.
- So now I'm a poor foot-soldier.

380
00:31:56,474 --> 00:31:59,968
Too lowly even to be noticed.

381

[hums tune]

00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:15,313

- I can't anymore. You're hurting.

Betsy!

385
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:37,228
- There must've been a misunderstanding.
- Jane, you never think ill of anybody.

386
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:40,848
How could Mr Darcy do such a thing?.

387
00:32:41,107 --> 00:32:44,214
I will discover the truth
from Mr Bingley this evening.

388
00:32:44,508 --> 00:32:46,641
Let Mr Darcy contradict it himself.

389
00:32:46,868 --> 00:32:49,001
Till he does,
I hope never to encounter him.

390
00:32:49,227 --> 00:32:51,360
Poor, unfortunate, Mr Wickham.

391
00:32:51,627 --> 00:32:53,605
Wickham is twice the man Darcy is.

392
00:32:53,826 --> 00:32:57,320
And, let us hope,
a rather more willing dancer.

393

[man] There they are, look.

394

- [lady] Oh, yes.
- [man] Billy.

395
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,724
[man] Jane Martin is here.

396
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:44,841
May I say what an immense pleasure
it is to see you again.

397
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,040
- Mrs Bennet.
- Miss Bingley.

00:33:50,939 --> 00:33:52,763

So am l.

00:33:55,298 --> 00:33:59,920
And how are you?. Miss Elizabeth?.
Are you looking for someone?.

402
00:34:00,258 --> 00:34:04,416
No, not at all, I was just admiring
the general splendour.

403
00:34:04,697 --> 00:34:08,191
- It is breathtaking, Mr Bingley.
- Good.

404
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:20,285
[Mrs Bennet] You might have passed
a few pleasantries with Mr Bingley.

405
00:34:20,575 --> 00:34:24,069
[Mrs Bennet] I've never met a
more pleasant gentleman in all my years.

406
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:26,664
Did you see how he dotes on her?.

- No. Perhaps he's through here.

Apparently, he's been detained.

Detained where?. He must be here.

- There you are.
- Mr Collins.

414

Perhaps you will do me the honour,
Miss Elizabeth.

415
00:35:22,007 --> 00:35:25,809
Oh, I did not think you danced,
Mr Collins.

416
00:35:26,087 --> 00:35:30,322
I do not think it incompatible
with the office of a clergyman.

417
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:33,790
Several people, her Ladyship
included, have complimented me

on my lightness of foot.

419
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:05,590
[Jane] Apparently, your Mr Wickham has
been called on some business to town.

420
00:36:08,921 --> 00:36:12,691
Dancing is of little consequence
to me, but it does...

421
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:16,300
...but it does afford
the opportunity to lavish...

422

-... upon one's partner attentions...
- [Jane] My informer tells me...

423
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:29,298
...that he would be less inclined
to be engaged, were it not for...

424
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:31,695
...the presence
of a certain gentleman.

425
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:33,858
[Collins] Which is my primary object.

426
00:36:34,118 --> 00:36:36,715
[Lizzie]
That gentleman barely warrants the name.

427
00:36:36,957 --> 00:36:39,676
[Collins]
It is my intention, if I may be so bold,

428
00:36:39,918 --> 00:36:42,283
to remain close to you
throughout the evening.

429
00:36:56,235 --> 00:36:58,446
May I have the next dance,
Miss Elizabeth?.

430
00:36:58,715 --> 00:37:00,461
You may.

431
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:14,080
- Did I agree to dance with Mr Darcy?.
- I dare say you will find him amiable.

432
00:37:14,353 --> 00:37:19,052
It would be most inconvenient since I've
sworn to loathe him for all eternity.

- [Darcy] lndeed. Most invigorating.

435
00:37:41,189 --> 00:37:43,478
It is your turn to say something,
Mr Darcy.

436
00:37:44,989 --> 00:37:46,348
I talked about the dance.

437
00:37:46,548 --> 00:37:51,093
Now you ought to remark on the size
of the room or the number of couples.

438
00:37:51,388 --> 00:37:55,190
I'm perfectly happy to oblige.
What would you like most to hear?.

439
00:37:55,468 --> 00:37:57,601
That reply will do for present.

440
00:38:00,786 --> 00:38:02,764
[Lizzie]
Perhaps by and by I may observe

441
00:38:03,026 --> 00:38:05,977
that private balls
are much pleasanter than public ones.

442
00:38:08,545 --> 00:38:11,496
For now, we may remain silent.

443
00:38:18,984 --> 00:38:21,858
[Darcy]
Do you talk as a rule while dancing?.

444
00:38:22,143 --> 00:38:25,714
No. No, I prefer to be
unsociable and taciturn.

445
00:38:29,662 --> 00:38:32,846
Makes it all so much more enjoyable,
don't you think?.

446
00:38:35,222 --> 00:38:38,870
Tell me, do you and your sisters
very often walk to Meryton?.

447
00:38:41,581 --> 00:38:44,765
Yes, we often walk to Meryton.

448
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,773
It's a great opportunity
to meet new people.

449
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:53,307
When you met us, we'd just had the
pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.

450
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:59,144
Mr Wickham's blessed with such happy
manners, he's sure of making friends.

451
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:01,983
Whether he's capable
of retaining them is less so.

452
00:39:02,218 --> 00:39:07,581
He's been so unfortunate as to lose
your friendship. That is irreversible?.

453
00:39:07,938 --> 00:39:11,785
- It is. Why do you ask such a question?.
- To make out your character.

454
00:39:12,057 --> 00:39:14,346
- What have you discovered?.
- Very little.

455
00:39:14,657 --> 00:39:17,919
I hear such different accounts
of you as puzzle me exceedingly.

456
00:39:19,336 --> 00:39:21,701
I hope to afford you more clarity
in the future.

457
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,199
[chattering]

458
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:09,205
- Is that Mr Darcy of Pemberley?.
- I believe so.

459
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,119
I must make myself known to him.

460
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:14,048
He's a nephew of my patroness,
Lady Catherine.

461
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:17,041
He will consider it an impertinence.

462
00:40:17,288 --> 00:40:19,653
Mr Darcy.

463
00:40:19,888 --> 00:40:21,866
Mr Darcy.

464
00:40:22,968 --> 00:40:27,435
Mr Darcy. Good evening...

465
00:40:27,768 --> 00:40:30,487
What interesting relatives you have.

466
00:40:42,964 --> 00:40:44,864
[sings]

467
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:50,815
Mary, dear,
you've delighted us long enough.

468
00:40:51,123 --> 00:40:54,230
Let the other young ladies have a turn.

469
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,724
[Bingley]...since I was a child,
and then she died.

470
00:40:59,962 --> 00:41:01,553
I have a beautiful grey.

471
00:41:01,802 --> 00:41:05,373
Of course, Caroline's
a much better rider than l, of course.

472
00:41:09,282 --> 00:41:13,362
Oh, yes. We fully expect
a most advantageous marriage.

473
00:41:14,601 --> 00:41:18,448
And my Jane, marrying so grand,
must throw her sisters in the way.

474
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:44,497
Clearly my family are seeing who can
expose themselves to the most ridicule.

475
00:41:44,837 --> 00:41:48,485
- At least Bingley has not noticed.
- No.

476
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:52,018
- I think he likes her very much.
- But does she like him?.

477
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:56,123
Few of us are secure enough to be
in love without proper encouragement.

478
00:41:56,396 --> 00:41:58,607
Bingley likes her enormously,

479
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:01,395
but might not do more
if she does not help him on.

480
00:42:01,636 --> 00:42:05,130
She's just shy. If he cannot
perceive her regard, he is a fool.

481
00:42:05,395 --> 00:42:07,684
We are all fools in love.

482
00:42:07,915 --> 00:42:10,712
He does not know
her character as we do.

483
00:42:10,994 --> 00:42:13,205
She should move fast
and snap him up.

484
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:16,618
There is plenty of time
for us to get to know him afterwards.

485
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,523
[Caroline] I can't help feeling
that someone's going to produce a piglet

486
00:42:21,793 --> 00:42:23,617
and make us chase it.

487
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:33,621
- Oh, dear!
- I do apologise, sir.

488
00:42:33,911 --> 00:42:37,559
I'm awfully sorry. Do forgive me.

489
00:42:56,428 --> 00:42:58,484
[lady] Emily, please!

490
00:42:59,907 --> 00:43:04,065
Mary, my dear Mary.
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

491
00:43:04,347 --> 00:43:07,298
- I've been practising all week.
- I know, my dear.

492
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:09,798
[Mary] I hate balls.

493
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,197
Mr Bennet, wake up.

494
00:43:30,424 --> 00:43:34,813
[Mrs Bennet]
Oh, I've never had such a good time!

495
00:43:37,223 --> 00:43:39,434
Charles, you cannot be serious.

496
00:43:46,301 --> 00:43:51,432
We'll have a wedding here in less than
three months if you ask me, Mr Bennet.

497
00:43:54,221 --> 00:43:55,690
Mr Bennet!

498
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,740
Mary, please.

499
00:44:11,578 --> 00:44:13,711
[Mr Bennet] Thank you, Mr Hill.

500
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:33,609
Mrs Bennet, I was hoping,
if it would not trouble you,

501
00:44:33,896 --> 00:44:38,208
that I might solicit
a private audience with Miss Elizabeth.

502
00:44:38,534 --> 00:44:43,819
Oh, certainly,
Lizzie would be very happy indeed.

503
00:44:44,134 --> 00:44:48,214
Everyone, out. Mr Collins would like
a private audience with your sister.

504
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:52,613
Wait, Mr Collins can have nothing
to say to me that anybody need not hear.

505
00:44:52,932 --> 00:44:56,580
I desire you will stay where you are.
Everyone else to the drawing room.

506
00:44:56,852 --> 00:44:58,288
- Mr Bennet.
- But...

507
00:44:58,491 --> 00:45:00,702
Now.

508
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:06,199
- Jane. Jane, don't... Jane!
- Jane.

509
00:45:08,891 --> 00:45:11,765
Papa, stay.

510
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:38,799
Dear Miss Elizabeth,

511
00:45:39,048 --> 00:45:42,387
My attentions have been
too marked to be mistaken.

512
00:45:42,686 --> 00:45:44,897
Almost as soon
as I entered the house,

513
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:49,943
I singled you out
as the companion of my future life.

514
00:45:50,285 --> 00:45:52,772
But before I am run away
with my feelings,

515
00:45:53,004 --> 00:45:55,568
perhaps I may state
my reasons for marrying.

516
00:45:55,804 --> 00:45:58,093
Firstly, that it is
the duty of a clergyman

517
00:45:58,324 --> 00:46:00,811
to set the example
of matrimony in his parish.

518
00:46:01,044 --> 00:46:04,770
Secondly, I am convinced
it will add greatly to my happiness.

519
00:46:05,043 --> 00:46:07,762
And thirdly,
that it is at the urging

520
00:46:08,002 --> 00:46:11,341
of my esteemed patroness,
Lady Catherine,

521
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,814
that I select a wife.

522
00:46:14,082 --> 00:46:16,956
My object in coming to Longbourn
was to choose such a one

523
00:46:17,202 --> 00:46:19,102
from among Mr Bennet's daughters,

524
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:22,040
for I am to inherit the estate

525
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:25,232
and such an alliance will surely...

526
00:46:26,481 --> 00:46:28,227
...suit everyone.

527
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,595
And now nothing remains but for me to
assure you in the most animated language

528
00:46:34,878 --> 00:46:37,243
- of the violence of my affections.
- Mr Collins!

529
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:39,497
And no reproach
on the subject of fortune

530
00:46:39,759 --> 00:46:44,071
- will cross my lips once we're married.
- You forget I have given no answer.

531
00:46:44,357 --> 00:46:47,696
Lady Catherine will
thoroughly approve when I speak to her

532
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:52,734
of your modesty, economy
and other amiable qualities.

533
00:46:53,037 --> 00:46:57,426
Sir, I am honoured by your proposal,
but I regret that I must decline it.

534
00:46:58,676 --> 00:47:02,324
I know ladies
don't seek to seem too eager...

535
00:47:02,635 --> 00:47:06,051
Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious.
You could not make me happy.

536
00:47:06,315 --> 00:47:09,731
And I'm the last woman
in the world who could make you happy.

537
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:14,270
I flatter myself that your refusal
is merely a natural delicacy.

538
00:47:14,554 --> 00:47:17,196
Besides, despite manifold attractions,

539
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:21,436
it is by no means certain another offer
of marriage will ever be made to you.

540
00:47:21,753 --> 00:47:25,092
I must conclude that you simply seek
to increase my love by suspense,

541
00:47:25,393 --> 00:47:29,473
according to the usual practice
of elegant females.

542
00:47:29,752 --> 00:47:33,091
I am not the sort of female
to torment a respectable man.

543
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:35,717
Please understand me,
I cannot accept you.

544
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,791
[Lydia & Kitty laugh]

545
00:47:42,751 --> 00:47:45,702
Headstrong, foolish child.

546
00:47:53,429 --> 00:47:58,947
Don't worry, Mr Collins. We'll have this
little hiccup dealt with immediately.

547
00:48:00,188 --> 00:48:03,450
Lizzie. Lizzie!

548
00:48:07,508 --> 00:48:11,510
Mr Bennet, we're all in an uproar!

549
00:48:11,827 --> 00:48:15,243
You must come
and make Lizzie marry Mr Collins.

550
00:48:15,506 --> 00:48:17,795
Mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie,

551
00:48:18,066 --> 00:48:21,405
but she vowed she will not have him,
and now the danger is

552
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,307
Mr Collins may not have Lizzie.

553
00:48:24,544 --> 00:48:28,856
- What am I to do?.
- Well, come and talk to her.

554
00:48:29,145 --> 00:48:30,228
Now!

555
00:48:42,423 --> 00:48:45,297
- Tell her you insist they marry.
- Papa, please.

556
00:48:45,543 --> 00:48:49,345
[Mrs Bennet] You will have this house
and save your sisters from destitution.

557
00:48:49,621 --> 00:48:52,374
- I can't marry him.
- Go and say you've changed your mind.

558
00:48:52,621 --> 00:48:54,986
- Think of your family.
- You cannot make me.

559
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:57,585
Mr Bennet, say something.

560
00:49:01,419 --> 00:49:04,526
Your mother insists
upon you marrying Mr Collins.

561
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,340
Yes, or I shall never see her again.

562
00:49:07,579 --> 00:49:11,305
From this day onward, you must be
a stranger to one of your parents.

563
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:13,868
Who will maintain you
when your father is dead?.

564
00:49:14,138 --> 00:49:17,709
Your mother will never see you again
if you do not marry Mr Collins,

565
00:49:17,977 --> 00:49:20,928
and I will never see you again
if you do.

566
00:49:21,177 --> 00:49:22,690
Thank you, Papa.

567
00:49:26,337 --> 00:49:30,649
[Mrs Bennet] Ungrateful child!
I shall never speak to you again.

568
00:49:30,976 --> 00:49:33,463
Not that I take
much pleasure in talking.

569
00:49:34,496 --> 00:49:37,060
People who suffer as I do
from nervous complaints

570
00:49:37,295 --> 00:49:40,092
can have no pleasure
in talking to anybody.

571
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:41,966
Jane!

572
00:49:45,175 --> 00:49:49,022
What's the matter?. Jane?.

573
00:50:41,408 --> 00:50:44,592
I don't understand
what would take him from Netherfield.

574
00:50:44,846 --> 00:50:46,979
Why does he not know when he'll return?.

575
00:50:47,206 --> 00:50:48,289
Read it.

576
00:50:57,205 --> 00:51:01,517
"Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister
and we are scarcely less eager.

577
00:51:01,844 --> 00:51:04,563
I do not think Georgiana Darcy
has her equal for beauty,

578
00:51:04,803 --> 00:51:08,451
elegance and accomplishment.
I hope to call her hereafter my sister."

579
00:51:08,723 --> 00:51:11,243
Is that not clear enough?.

580
00:51:11,484 --> 00:51:14,004
Caroline sees her brother
in love with you

581
00:51:14,242 --> 00:51:16,729
and has taken him off
to persuade him otherwise.

582
00:51:16,962 --> 00:51:21,584
But I know her to be incapable
of wilfully deceiving anyone.

583
00:51:21,922 --> 00:51:26,234
- It's more likely he does not love me.
- He loves you. Do not give up.

584
00:51:28,482 --> 00:51:30,382
Go to our aunt and uncle's in London,

585
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,979
Iet it be known you are there
and I am sure he will come to you.

586
00:51:43,279 --> 00:51:47,591
Give my love to my sister
and try not to be a burden, dear.
