1
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:23,997
DAY FOR NIGHT

2
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:26,397
Let's all be quiet and play well.

3
00:00:34,287 --> 00:00:37,359
Slowly and relaxed, in my tempo...

4
00:00:40,527 --> 00:00:42,757
From the beginning...

5
00:00:43,847 --> 00:00:47,044
Strike up together...

6
00:00:50,647 --> 00:00:53,286
Here you can speed up...

7
00:00:57,847 --> 00:01:01,396
Don't leave any gaps...

8
00:01:04,047 --> 00:01:06,003
There, now all together...

9
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,442
Hold that last chord...

10
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:39,197
No sentimentality.

11
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:40,959
Just play the notes.

12
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:54,445
This film is dedicated
to Dorothy and Lillian Gish

13
00:02:57,687 --> 00:02:58,324
Cut!

14
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:03,678
Everyone over here, please!

15
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:06,957
We'll do it again, right away!

16
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:13,205
What happened
coming out of the subway?

17
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:15,881
Last time it was better.

18
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:17,805
The bus was 2 seconds late.

19
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:20,680
The background activity
was late, too.

20
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:23,281
By the beauty parlor,

21
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:26,564
a lady was supposed to come out.

22
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:29,560
I never saw the cyclist go by,
either.

23
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:31,805
We'll do it again.

24
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:35,359
What went wrong was the beginning,

25
00:03:35,607 --> 00:03:37,120
coming out of the subway.

26
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:41,684
Everyone came out together,
then there was no one.

27
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:45,038
Note start and end footages,
circle the good takes...

28
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:48,323
- Who do you give it to?
- Yourself!

29
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:50,159
You mean, I keep it?

30
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,205
Kill that arc!

31
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:55,677
Ladies and gentlemen,

32
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:59,203
here we are
at the Victorine Studios, in Nice,

33
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:02,399
where shooting starts today
on "Meet Pamela".

34
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:06,276
But today you won't meet Pamela!

35
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:10,480
The Hollywood star, Julie Baker
who plays Pamela

36
00:04:10,647 --> 00:04:13,320
is expected soon,
but hasn't arrived yet.

37
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,399
But the other stars are here,

38
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:19,161
and I hope
to interview them shortly.

39
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:22,280
The slap may make it swell.
I don't mind!

40
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:25,602
Meet our male lead.

41
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:27,876
Mr. Bertrand!

42
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,727
You're the producer,
come and talk to us!

43
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:33,082
A producer should stay out of sight.

44
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:34,561
It's the story

45
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:37,122
of an older man

46
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:41,075
whose son brings home
an English bride.

47
00:04:41,487 --> 00:04:44,957
It's the story of a young man
who marries an English girl.

48
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:49,484
3 months later he brings her
to his parents' Riviera home.

49
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:52,281
My character falls in love

50
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:54,358
with his daughter-in-law,
and she with him.

51
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:56,762
She falls in love
with her father-in-law.

52
00:04:56,967 --> 00:05:00,801
The movie tells the story
of their illicit love affair.

53
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:02,076
What happens?

54
00:05:02,247 --> 00:05:05,205
As in any tragedy, each character

55
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:06,959
must fulfill his destiny.

56
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:09,960
Excuse me,
they need me on the set.

57
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:11,361
Pamela 1, take 4!

58
00:05:16,647 --> 00:05:18,319
The bus!

59
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,118
Newsvendor, be livelier!

60
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:33,764
The lady with the dog, faster!

61
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:36,487
More activity around the subway!

62
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:38,559
Now the white car!

63
00:05:40,327 --> 00:05:42,557
Alphonse, get ready!

64
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:44,524
Come out of the subway!

65
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:49,960
Faster!

66
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:54,001
Cafe terrace, more activity!

67
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:58,602
Lady with the dog, keep going!

68
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:02,479
Red car!

69
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:05,123
Faster, red car!

70
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:07,364
Red car, drive off!

71
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:10,758
Ready, Walter?
Move in on Alexander.

72
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:13,803
Move in closer!

73
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:17,363
Cut!

74
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:19,245
We'll do it from another angle.

75
00:06:19,407 --> 00:06:20,157
Roll it!

76
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:22,516
Take 2.

77
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:25,804
Cut!

78
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:28,925
The last one was good.

79
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:33,720
Places, everyone! Once more!

80
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,886
Let's go!

81
00:07:07,247 --> 00:07:08,919
This is the Atlantic Hotel.

82
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:10,846
In Nice.
Hold on, please.

83
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:13,077
I have a bathroom,
I wanted a shower.

84
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:15,442
Can I change rooms?

85
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:19,361
- Mine's a shower, I want a tub!
- We can trade!

86
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:21,518
Come on, let's go up! Great!

87
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:35,922
Julie's pictures!

88
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:37,846
OK, Joelle.

89
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:45,479
Julie's pictures...
Thanks, Odile.

90
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:48,366
Walter, have a look.
The pictures of Julie.

91
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:52,076
I remember her in that movie
with the car-chase.

92
00:07:53,287 --> 00:07:55,198
Didn't she freak out once?

93
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:58,564
A minor depression. Over a year ago!

94
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:00,683
She walked out of a production!

95
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,725
Yes, but now she's married
to her doctor.

96
00:08:03,887 --> 00:08:06,276
She must be fine now.

97
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:07,721
Is Bertrand worried?

98
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,366
I don't think so.

99
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:11,483
That's a good likeness.
She's lovely.

100
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:13,126
Any with her hair short?

101
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:14,766
Here's the wig.

102
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,441
- It's too dark.
- Could be lighter...

103
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:20,361
She'll wear a wig in "Pamela".

104
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:22,165
She has lovely eyes.

105
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:25,160
Yes, they're light green.

106
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:27,085
Looks just like her mother!

107
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:29,715
Good face, nice shape to it.

108
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,083
So pleasant...

109
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:34,045
Here's a good one!
She looks sad, but sexy.

110
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,921
Excuse me, sir.
I'd like to show you the...

111
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:40,043
Sure, Bernard, show it to us.

112
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,836
The trick candle
for the costume party.

113
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,680
Plugging it in, turns it on.
Got a light?

114
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:49,362
If the actress keeps
it toward her face,

115
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:51,882
the light seems
to come from the candle!

116
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:54,277
She mustn't turn the candle

117
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:56,438
toward the camera,

118
00:08:56,607 --> 00:08:58,916
or it'll give away the trick.

119
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:00,995
OK?

120
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:03,200
OK, Bernard. Sold.

121
00:09:04,447 --> 00:09:05,641
And the wire goes?

122
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:08,685
In the sleeve and down the dress.

123
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:10,724
Look at this vase!

124
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:12,843
Not bad for a hotel vase.

125
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:15,358
I'd like to see it

126
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:17,882
in Severine's dining room
in the movie!

127
00:09:18,047 --> 00:09:20,515
- It's cracked!
- Just swipe it!

128
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:28,365
Hi, Liliane. Hi, Alphonse.

129
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:30,880
These are for you!

130
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:32,719
Thanks for the trainee job.

131
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:35,720
Think you'll like
being a script-girl?

132
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:39,038
It's hard to say,
after one day!

133
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:41,767
It's a terrific job, you'll see.

134
00:09:41,927 --> 00:09:43,326
I'll let you know in 2 months.

135
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,364
Right... So long, kids.

136
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:48,121
You didn't tell me!

137
00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:49,442
He's stone deaf!

138
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:53,566
So what? Happened in the army.
Artillery fire!

139
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,366
Do me a favor.

140
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:59,995
Walk ahead,
so I can watch your ass.

141
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:01,646
Like this?

142
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:04,045
Yes, like that!

143
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,078
- I saw you!
- Saw me what?

144
00:10:25,247 --> 00:10:27,522
- You're hot for the maid.
- I am?

145
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:28,836
Bastard!

146
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:32,397
She's your type.
A bouncy little duckling.

147
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,717
Don't tell me you're jealous!

148
00:10:34,887 --> 00:10:38,277
Absolutely not!
Jealousy is dumb.

149
00:10:38,487 --> 00:10:40,682
Or you have go all the way...

150
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:42,200
and commit murder!

151
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:44,119
You're the jealous type.

152
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:47,355
I can tell: your eyebrows meet.

153
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:49,641
My eyebrows meet?

154
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,919
No, they don't!

155
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:55,524
Those 2 beds look Ionely,
maybe they should meet.

156
00:10:57,127 --> 00:10:59,163
We have to move the table.

157
00:10:59,647 --> 00:11:02,480
You could've asked for a double bed!

158
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:06,477
It meant asking Lajoie,
the new production manager.

159
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:10,965
It's heavy!

160
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,237
There.

161
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:18,639
Now the second!

162
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:26,402
It's tougher than moving audiences!

163
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:29,885
What'll we do tonight?

164
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:33,244
Pierrot, the stills man,
gave me a list

165
00:11:33,487 --> 00:11:36,559
of great little restaurants
up in the hills.

166
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:39,281
"Great little restaurants"!

167
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,683
We have to eat, don't we?

168
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:43,759
You must be kidding!

169
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:46,725
This town has 37 movie theaters!

170
00:11:46,887 --> 00:11:49,117
We look in the papers, pick a movie,

171
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:52,643
go there and make sure
when it starts.

172
00:11:52,807 --> 00:11:56,516
And if there's time,
we grab a sandwich.

173
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:03,002
Your stills man can take his list

174
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,522
of cute little "bistros"

175
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:07,325
and shove it!

176
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:09,000
You're impossible!

177
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:11,279
Listen, tonight,

178
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:14,718
I'm not going to a movie
or eating in this hotel

179
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:16,366
You decide.

180
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,518
OK, we'll do what you want...

181
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:21,240
But on one condition!

182
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,886
Which is?

183
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,764
That you marry me.

184
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:46,924
Odile, try this on.
It's for your scene.

185
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:50,839
Hold that. Not bad, huh?

186
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:53,077
Let's see the apron.

187
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:55,803
- Sold?
- I buy it.

188
00:12:57,287 --> 00:13:00,597
Shooting a movie is like
a stagecoach ride in the Old West.

189
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,644
At first you hope for a nice trip.

190
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:05,480
Soon you just hope
to reach your destination!

191
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:07,797
Excuse me for bothering you, sir.

192
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,720
I'm the new production manager,
Lajoie.

193
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:14,479
About the car for Pamela's accident.

194
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:16,359
You have to choose one.

195
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:18,006
One of those two?

196
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:21,920
Can the white one be painted blue?

197
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:24,563
Sure for Franc650!

198
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:27,924
Just to paint it blue?
We'll use it as it is!

199
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:30,317
But it is very white...

200
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,998
What about that blue one?

201
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:36,204
It belongs to your assistant,
Jean-François!

202
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:38,881
Maybe he won't mind.

203
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:41,157
- I'll ask him.
- Yes, do that.

204
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:43,758
What is a film-director?

205
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:47,317
Someone who's asked questions
about everything.

206
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,922
Sometimes he knows the answers.

207
00:13:51,127 --> 00:13:54,563
- You liked this location?
- It was fine. You were right

208
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:56,877
We were lucky, too. Great weather!

209
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:59,720
- Want to see the bungalow?
- Sure, let's go!

210
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:02,481
It's not built yet.
Just the sketches.

211
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:06,122
The interior will be furnished.

212
00:14:06,287 --> 00:14:09,199
Bed, night tables,
chairs, table with...

213
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:12,804
Hold on!
The camera will never go inside.

214
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:15,726
We'll only shoot
through the window.

215
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:18,560
So all we'll ever see is the bed.

216
00:14:25,527 --> 00:14:27,643
Sorry to bother you, but...

217
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:30,919
The Americans insist
on the original schedule.

218
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:32,805
You only have 7 weeks.

219
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:37,556
- Think you can do it?
- It won't be easy.

220
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:41,119
If you need 3 or 4 days
for pick-up shots,

221
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:43,642
we'll use a skeleton crew.

222
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:46,685
But the actors
must be released by Oct. 31st.

223
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:50,678
I'll go over the schedule
with Jean-François.

224
00:14:52,487 --> 00:14:56,082
7 weeks.
Five days a week. 35 days!

225
00:14:56,247 --> 00:14:58,522
I can't shoot this script
in 35 days.

226
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,883
Can you look at this?

227
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:03,003
It's Severine's wig...

228
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,318
Isn't it a little too light?

229
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:10,002
Too light? I really don't know.

230
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,920
Tell Joelle to see Walter about it.

231
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:15,555
He's the cameraman, they can decide.

232
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:18,323
Props wants to see you.

233
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:26,205
Which gun do you like
for the final scene?

234
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:30,877
Alphonse has small hands.

235
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:34,357
But we won't take the smallest...
This one!

236
00:15:36,087 --> 00:15:39,079
"Pamela" crew
report to screening room.

237
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:41,560
Here they are!

238
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:46,164
Rank and file all present
and accounted for? Good!

239
00:15:46,327 --> 00:15:49,205
You'd be lost without
the rank and file!

240
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:51,643
What rushes are we seeing?

241
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:53,605
Severine and Alphonse...

242
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:56,884
- And the crowd scene?
- It didn't come in.

243
00:15:57,087 --> 00:16:00,397
That's strange.
The crowd scene's missing.

244
00:16:01,287 --> 00:16:04,279
Call and ask the lab in Paris.

245
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:05,402
It's Scene 1.

246
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:08,041
Go ahead...
Wait! Where's Severine?

247
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:10,685
She never comes to rushes.

248
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:18,245
- Where's Alexander?
- At the airport, as usual.

249
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:19,681
He goes every day!

250
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:22,315
He must be expecting someone.

251
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:24,443
I bet he has personal problems.

252
00:16:28,247 --> 00:16:31,080
Mother, I have to talk to you.

253
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:33,438
It's about them, do you mind?

254
00:16:33,687 --> 00:16:35,325
- Yes!
- I have to!

255
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:38,440
I've found out they're in Paris.

256
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:40,878
They're not even hiding.

257
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,517
Why torture yourself?

258
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:48,636
Be like me. Don't think about them.

259
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,445
That's all I think about.

260
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:54,882
Let's go away.
Just the two of us, far away.

261
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,356
We'll do whatever you want.

262
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:05,365
I've made up my mind
to go to Paris.

263
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:07,126
to kill them both!

264
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:28,842
Use the "Not even hiding"
from Take 3.

265
00:17:59,407 --> 00:18:01,238
We've got a big problem.

266
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:03,238
A power failure at the lab.

267
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:07,116
It ruined the crowd scene,
it has to be re-shot.

268
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:10,640
- When can you do it?
- Day after tomorrow...

269
00:18:10,807 --> 00:18:14,482
Not before Monday!
We have to round up 150 extras!

270
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:17,844
- The insurance?
- I presume we're covered.

271
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:21,636
The way to make money today
is in real estate, not movies!

272
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:24,321
I stay in it, because I love it...

273
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:32,799
If we have to re-shoot the scene,
we will.

274
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:37,964
How are you, Alexander?

275
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:40,641
- That's nice. Is it for me?
- No, it's not.

276
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:43,967
Lajoie, our production manager.

277
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,960
- What's that?
- A bouquet for Madame Severine.

278
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,039
Wrapped in newspaper?
Go wrap it properly!

279
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:53,485
Tell me...

280
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:57,001
Does Severine know
I play her husband?

281
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:58,998
Of course. She was delighted.

282
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:01,756
That's good.

283
00:19:01,927 --> 00:19:03,201
Go say hello to her.

284
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:05,119
Where's her dressing-room?

285
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:27,277
I'm so happy to see you!

286
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:29,005
Gorgeous as ever!

287
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:33,843
What about you?
How do you keep so young?

288
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:40,118
- I'm delighted to work with you.
- So am I!

289
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:44,003
Remember when we first met
in Hollywood?

290
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:48,999
No dates! Never mention numbers!

291
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,727
Or I'll tell everyone
you had a facelift!

292
00:19:51,887 --> 00:19:53,002
Not yet. It's coming!

293
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:56,205
You know what? For you...

294
00:19:56,447 --> 00:20:00,122
I might take up cooking again!

295
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:03,723
Remember how you loved
my risotto Milanese?

296
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:05,525
Well, I don't any more!

297
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:10,885
Just kidding!
I'll eat your risotto any time!

298
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:14,523
- Are we working together today?
- No, it's you and Alphonse.

299
00:20:14,687 --> 00:20:16,917
I'm going to the airport.
See you.

300
00:20:22,407 --> 00:20:24,363
Isn't he adorable?

301
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:27,676
When did I work with him... ?

302
00:20:28,647 --> 00:20:30,683
20 years ago, in Hollywood!

303
00:20:31,087 --> 00:20:33,476
We were there at the same time.

304
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:36,600
You know, he was a real ladies man.

305
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:39,883
In Hollywood, they called him...

306
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:43,923
- I loved him, too.
- Is he married?

307
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:45,879
I don't know if he is now.

308
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:49,637
He was married and divorced twice.

309
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:51,445
Maybe he lives with someone.

310
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:54,201
No one knows. He's very secretive.

311
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:57,525
He has a moustache in the movie.
I like it.

312
00:20:58,247 --> 00:21:01,762
Moustache or not,
he's still playing lovers!

313
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:06,478
And look at me...
I'm only cast as the neglected wife!

314
00:21:06,647 --> 00:21:10,037
Desperate... tragic... a real pain...

315
00:21:10,247 --> 00:21:12,283
- You're lovely!
- No way...

316
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:15,440
Cue me for my scene today.

317
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,438
I can't remember a line!

318
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:22,757
For some reason, lately...

319
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:25,680
my memory has gone to hell.

320
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:38,963
Excellent dressing-room.

321
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:42,961
Nice and spacious.
Only the flowers are missing.

322
00:21:43,127 --> 00:21:44,685
They've been ordered.

323
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:48,239
You know,
I admire Julie Baker as much as you.

324
00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:50,005
You wanted her, we got her!

325
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:52,920
But if she has a breakdown,
we've had it!

326
00:21:53,087 --> 00:21:53,997
What do you mean?

327
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:58,365
After the medical exam,
the doctor refused to insure her.

328
00:21:58,607 --> 00:22:02,043
Said she's still too nervous,
and we should postpone

329
00:22:02,207 --> 00:22:03,481
the shoot for a month!

330
00:22:03,647 --> 00:22:05,763
What did the Americans say?

331
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:08,997
They're more flexible
than the French.

332
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:11,283
They're gambling with us.

333
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:14,519
But if we lose,
no one'll take the blame.

334
00:22:14,687 --> 00:22:16,484
We'll all be in hot water!

335
00:22:17,007 --> 00:22:19,805
You have to trust
your luck sometimes...

336
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:21,639
You're right.

337
00:22:22,527 --> 00:22:24,199
Still, it's a gamble!

338
00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:28,676
- Seen Severine since the rushes?
- I went to say hello.

339
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,839
You know she had
an affair with Alexander?

340
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:34,680
- I heard...
- Very stormy.

341
00:22:34,847 --> 00:22:36,724
Lots of publicity!

342
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:38,525
It ended badly.

343
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:43,397
For 4 years, no producer
could get them to work together.

344
00:22:43,807 --> 00:22:45,479
They hated each other!

345
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:48,445
But time heals all wounds.

346
00:22:50,207 --> 00:22:52,277
- Hello, Alphonse!
- Got a minute?

347
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:55,001
- Remember my check!
- It's all I think of.

348
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,441
Me, too!

349
00:22:56,887 --> 00:22:58,320
This'll only take a minute.

350
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,880
Great dressing-room!
Nicer than mine!

351
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,526
It's Julie's...

352
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:05,757
I'm getting married to Liliane.

353
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:07,679
Fine. I'm glad to hear it.

354
00:23:07,847 --> 00:23:10,998
Here in Nice.
Before we finish shooting.

355
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:14,637
I wondered...
Would you mind being my best man?

356
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:17,719
Not at all! I'd be delighted.

357
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:20,162
You think this looks all right?

358
00:23:20,327 --> 00:23:22,887
- It's not bad...
- Nice blue.

359
00:23:25,847 --> 00:23:29,283
Hit the fireplace
with a Senior spot!

360
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:32,325
A little more.

361
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:34,160
That's good, hold it!

362
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:38,076
Now a barndoor on the fire,
or we won't see it.

363
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:44,198
I can't take my eyes off the fire.

364
00:23:46,127 --> 00:23:48,118
People used to stare at fires,

365
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,555
now they watch TV.

366
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:51,041
We need to see

367
00:23:51,247 --> 00:23:54,000
moving images,
especially after dinner.

368
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,441
I never thought of that.

369
00:23:57,407 --> 00:23:59,284
Alphonse told me.
I'm very happy for you.

370
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:01,597
Congratulations.

371
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:03,246
Congratulations?

372
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:08,000
Gilbert, light the 103.

373
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:09,242
Put out the fire!

374
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,278
It's smoking up the set.

375
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:19,484
I'd like you to meet
two German girls.

376
00:24:19,687 --> 00:24:21,882
They're sisters: Greta and Diana.

377
00:24:22,247 --> 00:24:24,363
She was in a big
German political film.

378
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:25,795
Do you do any?

379
00:24:26,327 --> 00:24:29,797
She was in an erotic film.
Why don't you do one?

380
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:31,520
I have a good script

381
00:24:31,727 --> 00:24:33,319
about pollution.

382
00:24:33,487 --> 00:24:36,001
Excuse me. We've got problem.

383
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:38,476
- What problem?
- I'm rescuing you!

384
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:41,357
Meet Mr. Giacometti.

385
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,396
Got a minute?

386
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:44,920
After this shot.

387
00:24:46,207 --> 00:24:49,517
- Who's that guy?
- The cop who OK'd us to shoot

388
00:24:49,727 --> 00:24:52,878
in the streets. So Bertrand
invited him to watch us work.

389
00:24:53,447 --> 00:24:56,041
That's nice! Do I watch him work?

390
00:24:56,207 --> 00:24:58,084
When he interrogates people?

391
00:24:59,927 --> 00:25:02,202
Severine, we're ready.

392
00:25:09,527 --> 00:25:11,040
You start here.

393
00:25:11,327 --> 00:25:14,319
Quiet! A full rehearsal.

394
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,043
Let's go Severine.

395
00:25:18,927 --> 00:25:21,282
"I don't understand you, Alexander!

396
00:25:21,807 --> 00:25:23,320
"You're..."

397
00:25:23,527 --> 00:25:24,960
"Peculiar."

398
00:25:25,327 --> 00:25:28,717
It's all right!
Take it from the top, right away.

399
00:25:32,087 --> 00:25:34,362
"I don't understand you, Alexander.

400
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:36,962
"You've been peculiar, lately.

401
00:25:37,127 --> 00:25:39,357
"Walking out on dinner last night!

402
00:25:39,527 --> 00:25:41,518
"That was an insult to Julie."

403
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:43,359
Damn! I said Julie for Pamela!

404
00:25:43,807 --> 00:25:44,956
Not to worry.

405
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,446
That's bad...

406
00:25:46,887 --> 00:25:48,764
Don't worry... Once more.

407
00:25:48,927 --> 00:25:50,042
I've got an idea!

408
00:25:50,407 --> 00:25:54,036
I'll use numbers,
the way I do with Fellini!

409
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:58,196
Instead of: "I don't
understand you, Alexander..."

410
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:01,757
I'll say: 22, 83, 16, 72...

411
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:05,199
5, 3, 18, 9, 14, 7, 9...

412
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:07,844
17, 10, 10, 4,

413
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:09,804
18, 69...

414
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:12,277
Impossible, Severine!

415
00:26:13,687 --> 00:26:15,917
In France,
we have to say the lines.

416
00:26:16,087 --> 00:26:18,396
See? We're recording direct sound.

417
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:20,717
We'll find another solution.

418
00:26:21,127 --> 00:26:24,597
You always give me the scene
at the last minute!

419
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:27,156
Then we'll use prompt-cards.

420
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:29,443
Joelle, come here, darling.

421
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,366
It's all your fault.

422
00:26:32,607 --> 00:26:33,596
"I don't understand you...

423
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:37,998
"You've been peculiar lately."

424
00:26:38,887 --> 00:26:42,004
- Cut lots, we'll need them!
- Who asked you?

425
00:26:42,487 --> 00:26:44,557
Are they placed right?

426
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:49,277
The last one's back there.

427
00:26:50,007 --> 00:26:52,646
- Shooting now!
- Wait! Sound's reloading.

428
00:26:52,807 --> 00:26:54,559
Sound's ready!

429
00:26:54,727 --> 00:26:56,445
Hurry, Bernard!

430
00:27:04,327 --> 00:27:06,682
"I don't understand you, Alexander.

431
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:09,961
"You've been peculiar

432
00:27:10,487 --> 00:27:12,000

"You seem...

437
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:28,155
"to hate her!
You never speak to her.

438

"What do you want?
We're talking. Go away!

439
00:27:35,327 --> 00:27:37,557
"And I won't tolerate that! "

440
00:27:40,247 --> 00:27:41,441
Cut!

441
00:27:43,207 --> 00:27:44,083
I did it!

442
00:27:44,727 --> 00:27:45,716
Wasn't it good?

443
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:51,243
- Yes, but that's not the door!
- I thought it was.

444
00:27:51,407 --> 00:27:54,444
That's the closet. There's the door.

445
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:56,404
Let's do it again.

446
00:27:57,087 --> 00:27:59,043
We'll do it again.

447
00:27:59,207 --> 00:28:02,756
- I thought it was the same door.
- It's all right. Ready!

448
00:28:02,927 --> 00:28:04,997
They do look alike.

449
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:16,283
"I don't understand you, Alexander.

450

"And I won't tolerate that! "

458
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:48,562
Darling, look...

459
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,038
I know the doors are alike, but...

460
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:54,638
Not that one. This one!

461
00:29:03,927 --> 00:29:06,236
You're my only friend!

462
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:08,638
Come to my dressing-room?

463
00:29:11,687 --> 00:29:14,121
Come see me. Be nice!

464
00:29:25,607 --> 00:29:27,962
"I don't understand you, Alexander.

465

"After all, she is Alphonse's wife! "

468
00:29:54,047 --> 00:29:55,082
She'll never do it.

469
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:56,726
It's not my fault!

470
00:29:56,887 --> 00:29:58,559
Cut! Once more.

471
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:02,964
It's not my fault if I'm confused!

472
00:30:03,127 --> 00:30:07,405
I don't know if she's Odile,
actress. Or Odile, make-up girl!

473
00:30:07,567 --> 00:30:10,923
In my day, acting was acting...

474
00:30:11,327 --> 00:30:13,079
And make-up was make-up!

475
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:15,483
No wonder I'm confused!

476
00:30:21,447 --> 00:30:24,007
Anyone who has no business
on the set,

477
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:26,806
please leave now! Thanks.

478
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:44,039
[Skipped item nr. 478]

479
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:46,596
That doesn't mean you have to go.

480
00:30:46,807 --> 00:30:49,196
I wanted to go to the movies,
anyway.

481
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:52,719
Make-up, give me my mirror.

482
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:56,598
It's her fault, she's been boozing.

483
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:59,486
Her son's dying of leukemia...
She's afraid:

484
00:30:59,647 --> 00:31:01,638
a phone call could come any time.

485
00:31:01,807 --> 00:31:04,082
She almost turned down the film.

486
00:31:33,207 --> 00:31:35,516
It'll be all right, Severine.

487
00:31:36,007 --> 00:31:38,043
We'll take a little break.

488
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:42,121
I'm sorry. Maybe the wig
is giving me a headache.

489
00:31:44,287 --> 00:31:45,879
This has never happened before...

490
00:31:46,647 --> 00:31:48,080
It's the first time...

491
00:31:48,247 --> 00:31:50,078
Don't worry, Severine.

492
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:52,126
Wrap it up for today!

493
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:53,402
Get some rest.

494
00:31:53,807 --> 00:31:56,116
Where's Odile? Not that Odile!

495
00:31:56,287 --> 00:31:58,755
Tell the make-up girl
I want my scarf.

496
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:10,478
Why don't you make
political films?

497
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:14,881
Why don't you make erotic films?

498
00:32:15,407 --> 00:32:18,797
You have to finish shooting
in 7 weeks.

499
00:32:36,687 --> 00:32:40,043
Miss Severine
needs Odile in make-up.

500
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:44,316
Who is that woman I keep seeing?

501
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:47,206
Lajoie's wife.
Follows him everywhere.

502
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:50,120
Shall I try to get rid of her?

503
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:52,358
No, I'm getting used to her.

504
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:56,646
I don't know why Ferrand cast me.

505
00:32:56,807 --> 00:32:59,605
- He can't stand me!
- Who told you that?

506
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:02,884
I know he thinks
I'm a lousy actress.

507
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:05,800
Just between us, maybe he's right.

508
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:10,276
No, he didn't cast me!
Was it the producer?

509
00:33:11,287 --> 00:33:13,482
Something's peculiar
about this film.

510
00:33:13,647 --> 00:33:15,922
He never considered anyone else.

511
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,716
- Really?
- I know it.

512
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:23,566
You never understand anything
anyway!

513
00:33:23,727 --> 00:33:27,515
Well, I don't understand this!
It destroys me!

514
00:33:27,727 --> 00:33:30,799
I'm sorry,
I was hired to play a secretary!

515
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,481
No one mentioned a swimsuit!

516
00:33:33,647 --> 00:33:36,480
If they had,
I'd have brought my own!

517
00:33:37,727 --> 00:33:41,163
It's not in the script,
but the scene plays better.

518
00:33:41,327 --> 00:33:44,922
It's a working vacation.
The secretary is a guest.

519
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:47,282
She's swimming,

520
00:33:47,447 --> 00:33:49,358
then he dictates a letter.

521
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:53,076
Sorry, it's impossible.
I'm not being difficult.

522
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:55,238
I even learned to type!

523
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:58,197
I wasn't told I had to swim.

524
00:33:58,367 --> 00:34:00,437
I won't go near the water!

525
00:34:03,287 --> 00:34:05,642
What can we shoot
until she calms down?

526
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:09,720
Until Julie Baker gets here,
the pool scene is all we have!

527
00:34:09,887 --> 00:34:12,321
Go talk to her,
try to convince her.

528
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:16,480
An actress who won't appear
in a bathing suit is ludicrous!

529
00:34:24,247 --> 00:34:26,602
"Darling! A telegram!

530
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:28,325
"The children are coming!

531
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:32,321
"Our son got married
and we haven't met his bride!

532
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,718
"No, wait!
Here, this is for you.

533
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:37,798
"- They're coming?
- Day after tomorrow.

534
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:39,605
"It's about time!

535
00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:41,001
"I'm delighted.

536
00:34:41,327 --> 00:34:43,921
"I'll write Stanley at once.

537
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:49,203
"I have to dictate a letter.
It must go out today.

538
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:50,846
"Coming, sir.

539
00:34:51,087 --> 00:34:53,840
"Don't worry,
Stanley will solve it.

540
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:57,966
"If we could just rent
the house across the way!

541
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:00,886
"Marvelous!
Then they'd be close to us.

542
00:35:01,047 --> 00:35:02,275
"Sorry to bother you now.

543
00:35:02,447 --> 00:35:04,915
"The letter's to Stanley.

544
00:35:05,087 --> 00:35:06,725
"Dear Stanley...

545
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:10,323
"I'm pleased to announce
the arrival of Alphonse.

546
00:35:10,487 --> 00:35:13,365
"and his young bride..."

547
00:35:14,247 --> 00:35:16,761
Now I see why she wouldn't
wear a swimsuit.

548
00:35:16,927 --> 00:35:18,246
Why? She's lovely!

549
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,318
Take another look...

550
00:35:20,927 --> 00:35:21,916
Good God!

551
00:35:23,447 --> 00:35:25,836
Stacey tricked us!
She's 3 months pregnant!

552
00:35:26,007 --> 00:35:30,000
She kept it secret,
so let's tear up her contract.

553
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:34,319
I don't agree.
Frankly, I don't think it shows.

554
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:36,125
Come over here.

555
00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:40,202
Look at our schedule.

556
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:42,518
She shoots one more day now,

557
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:45,247
and comes back in 6 weeks.

558
00:35:45,407 --> 00:35:47,762
By then, it'll show!

559
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:49,963
We have to replace her.

560
00:35:50,407 --> 00:35:53,479
It's not a problem!
We'll pick someone now...

561
00:35:53,647 --> 00:35:55,285
and call her agent.

562
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:57,438
Look, there's lots of girls.

563
00:35:58,487 --> 00:36:01,843
Stacey has an iron-clad contract.
Her agent knows it.

564
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:04,283
I'll lose!

565
00:36:04,607 --> 00:36:08,600
You know why?
Because in life, might makes right!

566
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:12,603
Mr Ferrand, a package for you.

567
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:14,439
The books I ordered.

568
00:36:19,087 --> 00:36:21,442
- Delerue, the composer.
- I'll take it.

569
00:36:23,407 --> 00:36:26,922
Here's the playback
for the costume party scene.

570
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:53,796
That's lovely, Georges,
thank you!

571
00:36:57,487 --> 00:37:00,843
Airport...
Julie's plane... press conference!

572
00:37:01,007 --> 00:37:02,486
I can't be late.

573
00:37:03,007 --> 00:37:05,919
Say! You like to improvise.

574
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:09,996
Why can't the secretary
be pregnant in the film?

575
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:12,159
Maybe she could...

576
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:15,239
No! They'd suspect Alexander.

577
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:18,240
It'll confuse the story-line.
We can't do it.

578
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:22,844
Come to think of it...

579
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,157
Stacey isn't married!

580
00:37:25,607 --> 00:37:28,121
I wonder who the father is?

581
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:11,758
Your questions, gentlemen.

582
00:38:12,847 --> 00:38:15,520
Can you tell us
about your new movie?

583
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:18,241
"Meet Pamela"
is the story of a British girl

584
00:38:18,407 --> 00:38:21,797
who falls in love
with her husband's father.

585
00:38:22,687 --> 00:38:25,918
I think it's based on a true story.

586
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:27,722
How does it end?

587
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:31,517
Since it's a tragedy,

588
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:33,680
it'll end unhappily.

589
00:38:33,887 --> 00:38:37,516
But I'd rather not reveal
all the details.

590
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:41,884
Do you think these days
people care if a girl

591
00:38:42,047 --> 00:38:44,607
sleeps with her husband's father?

592
00:38:51,967 --> 00:38:54,765
When I like a script enough
to do it,

593
00:38:54,927 --> 00:38:57,441
I think audiences will like it, too.

594
00:38:57,647 --> 00:38:58,716
You do?

595
00:38:58,887 --> 00:39:00,366
Yes, and I hope I'm right.

596
00:39:00,567 --> 00:39:04,799
Forgive me for intruding
into your private life,

597
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,925
but American papers reported

598
00:39:08,127 --> 00:39:11,324
that after being ill,
you married your doctor.

599
00:39:11,687 --> 00:39:15,885
No, I didn't marry my doctor.
I married a man who's a doctor!

600
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,840
Why isn't the lucky man among us?

601
00:39:19,047 --> 00:39:22,926
My husband came with me.
In fact he's here,

602
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:24,680
in this very room.

603
00:39:25,007 --> 00:39:26,235
Where is he?

604
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:29,279
Sorry, he hates publicity.

605
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:31,085
On that little note of mystery,

606
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:34,762
we'll end this,
and let Miss Baker go to her hotel.

607
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:46,836
Let the reporters leave first.

608
00:39:50,327 --> 00:39:53,125
This is my husband, Dr Nelson.

609
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:01,718
Could you move back, please?

610
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:03,963
You're in the shot, there.

611
00:40:04,807 --> 00:40:06,399
Thank you very much.

612
00:40:07,207 --> 00:40:08,765
She's always around!

613
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,797
- She's Lajoie's wife...
- She thinks she's a crew member?

614
00:40:12,967 --> 00:40:17,563
No, she thinks women are after him!
She makes his life hell.

615
00:40:17,727 --> 00:40:19,445
He's too weak to dump her.

616
00:40:19,607 --> 00:40:22,679
We call them
"The Sorrow and the Pity"!

617
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:26,283
Lajoie, we're ready to shoot.

618
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:28,801
What's going on there?

619
00:40:30,087 --> 00:40:31,645
I don't like that at all!

620
00:40:32,007 --> 00:40:33,838
You have "le trac"?

621
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:35,606
What does that mean?

622
00:40:38,807 --> 00:40:41,640
Liliane! Slate this one, please!

623
00:40:41,927 --> 00:40:43,804
Our stills man's very busy!

624
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:46,277
Roll it!

625
00:40:52,407 --> 00:40:53,999
The car!

626
00:41:11,967 --> 00:41:14,083
"Hello, children!

627
00:41:14,447 --> 00:41:15,926
"My parents...

628
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:18,598
"Meet Pamela! "

629
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:21,003
Pan over to the stairs!

630
00:41:21,487 --> 00:41:24,001
"I know you'll be happy here.

631
00:41:24,207 --> 00:41:26,675
"Too bad our house isn't larger.

632
00:41:26,847 --> 00:41:29,998
"From the balcony
you can see the sea! "

633
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:32,486
"She's charming..."

634
00:41:32,647 --> 00:41:34,444
"Do you like it? "

635
00:41:37,047 --> 00:41:39,322
"My son never tells me anything!

636
00:41:39,487 --> 00:41:41,921
"I don't even know how you met."

637
00:41:42,927 --> 00:41:46,158
"I was on vacation in Yorkshire
with my 2 cousins,

638
00:41:46,327 --> 00:41:47,965
"Dorothy and Elizabeth.

639
00:41:48,127 --> 00:41:50,118
"He had a date with Dorothy.

640
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:53,563
"She got chicken-pox,
so I went on the date.

641
00:41:54,487 --> 00:41:56,717
"I don't know Dorothy,

642
00:41:56,887 --> 00:41:59,560
"but I'm glad
you didn't get chicken-pox! "

643
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:01,206
"Who got chicken-pox? "

644
00:42:01,607 --> 00:42:02,357
"Guess! "

645
00:42:03,047 --> 00:42:04,082
Cut!

646
00:42:04,487 --> 00:42:05,636
How was it?

647
00:42:05,807 --> 00:42:07,763
Not bad,
but we'll try something else.

648
00:42:09,607 --> 00:42:11,165
We're doing it again?

649
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,840
Was I late?

650
00:42:13,007 --> 00:42:14,963
We'll try it differently.

651
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:18,887
- Take a break, Severine.
- Odile!

652
00:42:23,447 --> 00:42:26,962
I wanted you with me,
so I got you the job!

653
00:42:27,527 --> 00:42:29,916
I wanted us to be together.

654
00:42:30,087 --> 00:42:33,523
But learning to be a script-girl
is a waste of time.

655
00:42:33,687 --> 00:42:35,484
I want to learn film-editing.

656
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,796
Film-editing?

657
00:42:36,967 --> 00:42:40,562
You just had to say the word!
I'd have arranged it!

658
00:42:42,287 --> 00:42:45,324
You're here to take stills, right?

659
00:42:51,607 --> 00:42:54,280
Odile!
Get that bottle out of my sight!

660
00:42:56,247 --> 00:42:57,805
How's your mother?

661
00:42:57,967 --> 00:43:00,640
Fine! I told her
we were working together.

662
00:43:00,807 --> 00:43:02,445
She sends her love.

663
00:43:02,687 --> 00:43:05,804
Marvelous woman!
Everyone in Hollywood loved her.

664
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,164
Too bad she quit when she did.

665
00:43:08,327 --> 00:43:10,636
But she's still very busy.

666
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:13,641
She hated the way we shoot movies,

667
00:43:13,807 --> 00:43:15,479
in bits and pieces!

668
00:43:16,367 --> 00:43:19,279
I remember escorting her
to the premiere

669
00:43:19,447 --> 00:43:21,722
of her first big Hollywood movie.

670
00:43:21,887 --> 00:43:23,320
A fantastic evening!

671
00:43:23,487 --> 00:43:25,159
When the film ended

672
00:43:25,327 --> 00:43:28,239
she sat there,
then turned to me and said:

673
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:31,878
"I did all that?
All I remember is the waiting."

674
00:43:32,047 --> 00:43:33,002
It's so true!

675
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:36,802
I'm calm, not yelling.
But I say you're on the make!

676
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:40,164
- That's not true!
- Oh, no? I'm in agony!

677
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:44,366
I'm in agony all the time!
I can't wait to finish a scene,

678
00:43:44,527 --> 00:43:47,883
so I can go look for you!
I'm a complete wreck!

679
00:43:48,327 --> 00:43:49,919
I can't find Alphonse!

680
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:51,520
I know where he is.

681
00:43:56,847 --> 00:43:59,600
While I'm shooting, I'm in agony!

682
00:44:00,687 --> 00:44:03,440
Can I shoot a scene
when I'm like this?

683
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,878
I'm supposed to keep cool!

684
00:44:06,927 --> 00:44:09,441
If I'm no good, you're to blame!

685
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,761
I'm sorry to make you die again.

686
00:44:22,847 --> 00:44:26,123
I'm used to it.
In 80 movies, I've died 24 times.

687
00:44:26,407 --> 00:44:29,205
Electrocuted twice, hanged twice,

688
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:31,801
I've been knifed,
committed suicide,

689
00:44:32,567 --> 00:44:35,604
died in accidents,
but never a natural death.

690
00:44:35,767 --> 00:44:38,679
Anyway,
I don't think death is natural.

691
00:44:43,287 --> 00:44:46,245
Julie will be right out,
she's changing.

692
00:44:46,407 --> 00:44:48,967
- Did things go well?
- I'm very pleased.

693
00:44:49,127 --> 00:44:52,324
I've never used an actress
I hadn't met before.

694
00:44:52,487 --> 00:44:56,116
But Julie's just right,
determined, yet fragile.

695
00:44:56,367 --> 00:44:58,198
She's perfect for the role.

696
00:44:58,367 --> 00:44:59,800
It'll go fine.

697
00:45:38,967 --> 00:45:41,322
Sorry to keep you waiting, Stacey.

698
00:45:42,247 --> 00:45:44,238
It'll take 5 minutes, Bernard.

699
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,722
You won't miss your plane.

700
00:45:55,567 --> 00:45:57,797
Ready with the pool scene?

701
00:45:57,967 --> 00:45:59,525
Good, let's run it.

702
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:05,797
I need you.

703
00:46:05,967 --> 00:46:08,197
I have an urgent letter to dictate.

704
00:46:08,367 --> 00:46:09,846
Yes sir. Right away.

705
00:46:14,887 --> 00:46:17,640
- It doesn't show at all.
- You're sure? Good!

706
00:46:18,127 --> 00:46:20,357
- That's lovely.
- If you say so...

707
00:46:20,807 --> 00:46:22,001
It's not too... ?

708
00:46:28,967 --> 00:46:31,561
- So it's OK?
- You can leave, don't worry.

709
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,842
Have a nice trip.

710
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:40,836
Now run the rest...

711
00:47:02,367 --> 00:47:03,482
Know what?

712
00:47:03,647 --> 00:47:05,603
I want to touch you.

713
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:09,325
- What's that set?
- The love-nest.

714
00:47:09,847 --> 00:47:13,078
- It's in the script!
- I never read scripts.

715
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:16,637
It's when Alexander
runs off with Pamela.

716
00:47:17,527 --> 00:47:20,678
They stop at a shady motel...

717
00:47:20,847 --> 00:47:22,200
Get it?

718
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:24,996
It's morning,
they want to make love.

719
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:28,159
She puts the tray outside
to keep the maid out.

720
00:47:28,927 --> 00:47:31,885
I'll leave.
You're not in this scene.

721
00:47:32,847 --> 00:47:34,838
Don't worry, I'll be around.

722
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:38,318
Let me ask you...

723
00:47:38,487 --> 00:47:39,715
Are women magic?

724
00:47:39,887 --> 00:47:42,082
No, they're not.
Neither are men.

725
00:47:42,247 --> 00:47:44,636
If a woman says
she's known outstanding men,

726
00:47:44,807 --> 00:47:46,843
it means she's slept around...

727
00:47:51,887 --> 00:47:53,684
Excuse me, sir.

728
00:47:58,567 --> 00:48:01,559
I have to take 3 days off.

729
00:48:02,807 --> 00:48:04,126
You're leaving the crew?

730
00:48:04,287 --> 00:48:05,959
My mother just died.

731
00:48:06,127 --> 00:48:09,836
- I see. Was it sudden?
- No, she was in great pain.

732
00:48:10,007 --> 00:48:11,884
For her, it was a relief.

733
00:48:12,047 --> 00:48:16,086
- I see. Well, go ahead.
- But someone will fill in for me.

734
00:48:16,247 --> 00:48:18,363
Sure, I understand.

735
00:48:20,327 --> 00:48:22,795
I think we can start now.

736
00:48:25,207 --> 00:48:28,324
You're not in the way, doctor.

737
00:48:28,487 --> 00:48:31,001
Sit down. This shot should be fun.

738
00:48:33,527 --> 00:48:36,166
I came to say goodbye.
My plane leaves in an hour.

739
00:48:36,407 --> 00:48:38,841
If I'm through, I'll drive you.

740
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:41,678
What are we waiting for now?

741
00:48:41,847 --> 00:48:43,803
Bernard, as usual.

742
00:48:43,967 --> 00:48:45,480
I'm ready!

743
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:51,881
One cat's milk,
another cat's poison!

744
00:48:54,967 --> 00:48:57,162
All right, we can go.

745
00:48:57,327 --> 00:48:59,443
Ready, Alexander? Julie?

746
00:49:10,767 --> 00:49:12,803
Not too romantic, the kiss...

747
00:49:28,807 --> 00:49:29,637
The cat!

748
00:49:43,407 --> 00:49:47,798
The boom is scaring it!
We'll wild-track the sound.

749
00:49:48,047 --> 00:49:49,685
At the fish market!

750
00:50:00,447 --> 00:50:01,926
Cut! Once more!

751
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,805
Do it this time, or else!

752
00:50:11,207 --> 00:50:13,437
I swear,
it hasn't been fed in 3 days!

753
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:16,400
Throw it in!

754
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:23,805
We'll shoot the scene

755
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:25,923
when you find
a cat that can act!

756
00:50:26,127 --> 00:50:28,038
I told you to get 2 cats!

757
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,040
Miss Know-it-all!

758
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:52,676
But when we're through,

759
00:50:52,887 --> 00:50:55,560
I still have
to remove my make-up.

760
00:50:55,727 --> 00:50:58,161
Why did you let me down, puss?

761
00:50:58,367 --> 00:51:00,278
You got me in trouble!

762
00:51:00,487 --> 00:51:01,806
Now where's Joelle?

763
00:51:02,407 --> 00:51:04,967
I found one!
It's the studio cat.

764
00:51:05,127 --> 00:51:07,960
I can tell by looking at it,

765
00:51:08,127 --> 00:51:09,799
that it won't perform!

766
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:12,356
Don't fight.
We'll try the studio cat.

767
00:51:14,327 --> 00:51:15,806
Places, everybody!

768
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:17,156
The kiss...

769
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,763
The tray...

770
00:51:21,607 --> 00:51:22,676
The door...

771
00:51:26,127 --> 00:51:26,957
The cat!

772
00:51:37,847 --> 00:51:39,246
Focus!

773
00:51:57,127 --> 00:51:58,765
Focus on the cat!

774
00:52:24,567 --> 00:52:28,480
Excuse me...
Can I ask you something?

775
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:32,725
In your opinion, are women magic?

776
00:52:35,327 --> 00:52:36,806
Some are, yes.

777
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,761
Others, no!

778
00:52:55,087 --> 00:52:57,920
Don't worry.
Julie will be fine.

779
00:52:58,087 --> 00:53:00,920
Yes, she's very happy on this film.

780
00:53:01,087 --> 00:53:02,839
I'm sure she'll come through.

781
00:53:03,007 --> 00:53:06,317
- Actors are so vulnerable!
- Of course they are.

782
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:09,397
Everyone is afraid of being judged.

783
00:53:09,567 --> 00:53:11,239
But actors

784
00:53:11,687 --> 00:53:14,042
are always being judged.

785
00:53:14,247 --> 00:53:16,807
In your work, and in your life!

786
00:53:17,047 --> 00:53:20,357
We wonder what people think of us,
if they love us.

787
00:53:21,487 --> 00:53:23,478
It must be the same

788
00:53:23,687 --> 00:53:25,245
for all performers.

789
00:53:26,487 --> 00:53:29,877
As a child, when Mozart
was asked to play, he'd reply:

790
00:53:30,087 --> 00:53:33,363
"Gladly,
but first say you love me."

791
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:37,082
And in your job,
you're always kissing.

792
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:38,726
As you say...

793
00:53:39,127 --> 00:53:40,958
Yes, we do a lot of kissing.

794
00:53:41,847 --> 00:53:45,760
The handshake was invented
to show you're unarmed, friendly.

795
00:53:46,647 --> 00:53:48,365
We went one better:

796
00:53:48,607 --> 00:53:50,404
we show our love.

797
00:53:51,207 --> 00:53:54,119
"My darling, you're so wonderful..."

798
00:53:55,367 --> 00:53:56,959
We need all that!

799
00:54:36,447 --> 00:54:39,803
Meet Christian Fersen.
Our director, Mr Ferrand.

800
00:54:40,167 --> 00:54:42,886
Were you waiting outside?
You should've come in.

801
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,366
Do you see what I see?

802
00:54:47,447 --> 00:54:50,519
- Are women magic?
- Not women, their legs!

803
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:52,757
That's why they wear skirts.

804
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:55,282
Cut the crap! We going to a movie?

805
00:54:56,087 --> 00:54:58,521
- When does it start?
- We gotta leave.

806
00:54:58,687 --> 00:55:02,521
The kitchen scene must be shot
tomorrow night!

807
00:55:02,927 --> 00:55:06,363
The union contract
calls for a 12-hour break.

808
00:55:06,527 --> 00:55:09,485
Joelle, we must shoot
the kitchen tomorrow.

809
00:55:10,527 --> 00:55:12,438
- Can you work with me tonight?
- OK.

810
00:55:12,607 --> 00:55:14,518
So much for the movies!

811
00:55:15,407 --> 00:55:17,045
What's this I hear?

812
00:55:17,207 --> 00:55:19,277
Yes,
we do the kitchen scene tomorrow.

813
00:55:19,447 --> 00:55:22,917
- Can I have my lines?
- After dinner, tonight.

814
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:26,079
- That's not much time!
- It's not written yet.

815
00:55:26,247 --> 00:55:28,841
Read it once
and put it under your pillow.

816
00:55:29,007 --> 00:55:31,760
In the morning,
you'll know it by heart!

817
00:55:31,967 --> 00:55:33,525
You're an optimist!

818
00:55:36,687 --> 00:55:39,918
Reporters always ask
the same questions.

819
00:55:40,207 --> 00:55:42,084
"How does it feel to be famous?

820
00:55:42,247 --> 00:55:45,603
"To be recognized
and asked for autographs? "

821
00:55:45,767 --> 00:55:50,682
But no TV program I've seen
ever shows that a working movie-star

822
00:55:50,887 --> 00:55:55,438
gets up at 6AM
and gets home at 9PM!

823
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,239
A 15-hour work-day!

824
00:55:58,007 --> 00:55:59,486
Not quite 15 hours.

825
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:03,117
Say 13.
Or 14, if you go to the rushes.

826
00:56:04,207 --> 00:56:07,404
Miss Severine isn't in her room.

827
00:56:12,047 --> 00:56:15,119
"The Godfather"
is showing all over Nice.

828
00:56:15,287 --> 00:56:17,847
It's wiping out every other movie!

829
00:56:18,047 --> 00:56:21,278
Speaking of godfathers,
how about Alexander?

830
00:56:21,447 --> 00:56:24,519
He fooled everybody.
We all expected a Lolita,

831
00:56:24,687 --> 00:56:27,804
and a handsome Romeo
got off the plane!

832
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:32,438
Maybe he could do
Pamela's car-accident stunt.

833
00:56:32,607 --> 00:56:36,486
It's too dangerous!
We need a real stuntman!

834
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:38,877
Back to the kitchen scene!

835
00:56:39,447 --> 00:56:42,644
That night, Alexander
finds Pamela in the kitchen.

836
00:56:42,807 --> 00:56:44,001
Why the kitchen?

837
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:47,125
So as not to arouse any suspicions.

838
00:56:47,647 --> 00:56:50,161
I'm not happy with my first draft.

839
00:56:50,367 --> 00:56:52,881
He: "You know
what's happening to us? "

840
00:56:53,047 --> 00:56:55,003
She: "I think I do."
That's bad!

841
00:56:55,207 --> 00:56:59,359
Pamela must know,
or her character will seem weak.

842
00:56:59,527 --> 00:57:03,440
The scene needs a new idea.
Call your co-writer!

843
00:57:04,207 --> 00:57:07,085
I thought of it. He's in Japan.

844
00:57:07,807 --> 00:57:10,560
He's adapting
Turgenev's "First Love".

845
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:13,082
Set in modern Japan! Great idea!

846
00:57:13,247 --> 00:57:15,920
Better than "Pamela"!
I should've done it!

847
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:18,317
Want a story-line?

848
00:57:18,487 --> 00:57:21,240
How about:
Kissinger's Successful Mission?

849
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:24,160
Heart Transplant...
Jeweler Knifes Wife.

850
00:57:24,327 --> 00:57:26,841
Back to work!
You dictate, I'll type.

851
00:57:27,047 --> 00:57:29,436
We promised it to Julie tonight.

852
00:57:29,607 --> 00:57:31,723
OK, back to the kitchen...

853
00:57:31,887 --> 00:57:35,038
No more guilt
or sense of shame.

854
00:57:35,207 --> 00:57:39,439
They decide to run away
like thieves in the night.

855
00:57:39,607 --> 00:57:42,246
Pamela could actually say that!

856
00:57:42,407 --> 00:57:45,285
We must show
that she's completely lucid.

857
00:57:45,447 --> 00:57:48,598
She loved the son,
now she loves the father.

858
00:57:48,767 --> 00:57:52,555
- That must come across.
- Julie explained it very well.

859
00:57:52,727 --> 00:57:55,924
Here's her interview,
in the morning paper.

860
00:57:56,087 --> 00:57:59,124
"The girl realizes
the boy she married

861
00:57:59,287 --> 00:58:02,040
"is only a pale reflection
of his father."

862
00:58:02,207 --> 00:58:04,516
She understood the script! Why?

863
00:58:04,687 --> 00:58:08,475
Because her mother was an actress.
She knows Hollywood,

864
00:58:08,647 --> 00:58:12,003
where many kids try to live up
to famous parents.

865
00:58:12,207 --> 00:58:15,040
Fairbanks, Barrymore and others.

866
00:58:15,327 --> 00:58:16,646
Alexander:

867
00:58:17,647 --> 00:58:20,844
"You know what's happening to us? "
Damn, the phone!

868
00:58:25,367 --> 00:58:27,597
Miss Dominique is here,
should she come up?

869
00:58:27,807 --> 00:58:31,038
Sorry, I'm working.
I'll call tomorrow.

870
00:58:31,247 --> 00:58:32,760
I'll give her the message.

871
00:58:33,007 --> 00:58:35,965
He's sorry, he has to work tonight.

872
00:58:36,127 --> 00:58:38,243
He'll call you tomorrow.

873
00:58:38,607 --> 00:58:40,723
- Three guesses?
- Stacked!

874
00:58:40,887 --> 00:58:43,082
- Riviera beauty.
- Local call-girl.

875
00:58:43,367 --> 00:58:45,085
- The warrior's rest!
- Right!

876
00:58:45,247 --> 00:58:47,044
Hey, the movie quiz!

877
00:58:50,367 --> 00:58:52,756
In what movie
did Jeanne Moreau co-star

878
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:55,879
with Orson Welles,
in a Shakespeare film?

879
00:58:56,247 --> 00:58:57,236
"Falstaff"!

880
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,840
Correct.

881
00:58:59,047 --> 00:59:01,880
In what movie
was she Charles IX's sister

882
00:59:02,047 --> 00:59:03,605
and Henry IV's wife?

883
00:59:05,447 --> 00:59:06,357
"Queen Margot"!

884
00:59:06,527 --> 00:59:08,438
Right.
You know your stuff.

885
00:59:09,327 --> 00:59:11,477
Julie, here's tomorrow's scene.

886
00:59:26,967 --> 00:59:28,923
"Yes, I'm in love with you."

887
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:33,800
"We both knew it
at the costume party."

888
00:59:34,807 --> 00:59:37,719
"I can't stay here,
I'm leaving tomorrow."
