1
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,752
Mister foreman,
have you arrived at a verdict?

2
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,035
We have, your honour.

3
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,835
We find the defendant
guilty of all charges.

4
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,755
-He has no priors--
-That's misleading.

5
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,029
He has no convictions.

6
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,073
-ls he dangerous?
-No, but he's a slippery little shit.

7
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,316
Your honour,
request bail be continued--

8
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,035
He's already wasted the jury's time,
not to mention yours.

9
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,357
-He has no priors, your honour.
-Judge, lock him in now.

10
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,028
No, your honour.
He's a very decent family man.

11
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,475
But he has no priors.
He has no convictions.

12
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,915
I don't care about the pri--
Misleading?

13
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,509
-ls he violent?
-He wouldn't hurt a flea.

14
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,109
-I mean, a fly.
-You're very naive.

15
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,673
I'm not naive!

16
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,279
That's enough of this.

17
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,034
All right, I'm going with you.

18
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,433
I got your bail continued.

19
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,471
I don't want my bail continued.

20
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,830
Mr. LaPlante, they found you guilty.

21
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,433
Guilty? What do you mean?

22
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,631
The jury found you guilty.

23
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,791
I'm innocent, for chrissake!

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,437
Mr. LaPlante, I've been persuaded,
in view of your continued employment...

25
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,278
...and your lack of priors...

26
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,671
...to continue your bail
under the same conditions...

27
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,912
...pending sentencing six days from now.

28
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,476
In the meantime, make an appointment
with a probation officer...

29
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,951
...who will make a recommendation to me
regarding your sentence.

30
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,073
I urge you...

31
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,871
...to use those six days to get
your personal affairs in order...

32
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,078
...in anticipation of incarceration.

33
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,878
In anticipation of incarceration.

34
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,271
"ln anticipation of incarceration."

35
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,238
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.

36
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,876
I know what he means. I'm not
a prison kind of guy, Miss O'Day.

37
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,238
You're not doing your job. Last time
my lawyer got the charges dismissed.

38
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,438
That's why the district attorney
is so hard-nosed this time.

39
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,636
-An appeal?
-We don't have the grounds.

40
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,429
What we have to do is focus
on the probation officer's report.

41
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,671
He gives a good report and I walk?

42
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,236
I think a suspended sentence
is unlikely. Now....

43
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,229
You still have your job, right?

44
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,237
I've been calling in sick.

45
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,471
And a son by your ex-wife, Joseph?

46
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,551
A son? Yeah.
What about him? Joey.

47
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,631
Are you involved in his upbringing?

48
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,559
Involved?
She attached my paycheck, child support.

49
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,236
Why do you think I got a court-appointed
lawyer instead of an experienced one?

50
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,233
I understand.
How often do you see your son?

51
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,237
The kid? I don't know.

52
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,835
On his birthday. When was that?
May, I think.

53
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,753
She don't like for me to see him.
Thinks I'm a bad influence.

54
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,190
I think you should see your son.

55
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,674
Try to get your boss to write a note
about your performance on the job.

56
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,038
Create the impression of a decent
citizen with familial responsibilities...

57
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,317
...who happened to slip up once.

58
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,076
And I know that you're having
financial difficulties, Mr. LaPlante...

59
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,632
...but I was wondering if the money
that I loaned you last week....

60
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,033
Some of it.

61
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,033
I'll get you the rest as soon as I can.

62
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,279
If you're a little short, it's okay.
I don't want to take your last dime.

63
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,829
I'd better keep some of it,
if I'll see the kid.

64
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,837
For gas and stuff.

65
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,397
Look at that one.
If you were in there, he'd kill you.

66
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,828
Wouldn't he, Dad?

67
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,629
Yeah, yeah. Something like that.

68
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,680
You know this friend
that your mother's seeing?

69
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,433
What is he, a fireman?

70
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,553
Did he ever, you know, just kind of
spend the night? What's his name?

71
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,677
Sometimes. His name is Elliott.

72
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,150
He saved a guy's life
one time in a fire.

73
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,594
A hero?

74
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,959
Was he ever in the Nam,
this guy Elliott?

75
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,838
The "Nam"? What's that?

76
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,435
It was this war, Vietnam.

77
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,233
Doesn't matter.

78
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,036
Were you in it? In the war?

79
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,475
-You didn't see that picture?
-What picture?

80
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,229
Me in my uniform.
Used to be over the fireplace.

81
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,557
In public restrooms,
you're always standing in piss.

82
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,472
It don't matter to you.
You got sneakers.

83
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,280
But I'm standing in piss
in very expensive shoes.

84
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,829
I don't want piss on them.
I want to protect them.

85
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,235
It's a breakdown in custodial services.

86
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,436
Look, somebody lost their wallet.

87
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,834
What?

88
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,039
-Wait a minute.
-To give it to the manager.

89
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,475
He pockets the dough,
throws the wallet away.

90
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,276
We'll go out back. Most people who work
in supervisory positions are crooks.

91
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,430
You didn't pay.

92
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,790
The waiter knows me.
I got an account here.

93
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,555
Tomorrow, when I get to the office...

94
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,395
...my secretary will phone this guy up
from the name on his license.

95
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,910
Let the guy come and get his wallet.
Make sure you get a reward.

96
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,832
You deserve a reward.

97
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,433
Spare some change, sir?

98
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,278
No way, fella. Not a chance.

99
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,875
Resist the urge to be nice
to those people.

100
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,873
They're con artists.
Take advantage of the soft heart.

101
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,475
A lot of them are better off
than the rest of us.

102
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,075
Look out for number one.
It sounds harsh...

103
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,039
...but it's a goddamn jungle out there.

104
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,992
You got to keep a low profile.

105
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,189
Right?

106
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,636
A low profile.

107
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,636
Hey, Bernie. Where you been, pal?

108
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,030
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?

109
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,075
Spanish kind of guys?

110
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,238
Business thing.
Give me a seven and seven, will you?

111
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,558
Five days now, I don't see you?

112
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,351
It's because I'm up to my ass in shit.
I'm broke because I got legal problems.

113
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,397
Nobody was asking for me, huh?

114
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,514
Nope.

115
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,432
Legal problems?

116
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,557
You gotta have a good attorney.

117
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,036
She's just out of law school. A couple
years older than my kid, for chrissake.

118
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,275
You got a kid?

119
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,029
How old's your kid?

120
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,555
Nine, I think. Maybe 10.

121
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,950
Yeah, 10. Nice kid.

122
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,510
You got a 10-year-old attorney, Bernie?

123
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,752
I can't afford no better.

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,436
My ex, she attached my paycheck
for child support payments.

125
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,829
You looking for Bernie LaPlante
by any chance?

126
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,075
You have a kid?

127
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,073
Kids are so young.
They don't know nothing yet.

128
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,232
When you're a kid, you think
you'll grow up to be wonderful...

129
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,869
...instead of an asshole,
like everybody else.

130
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,919
We're all assholes?

131
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,751
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna
be this fantastic, heroic human being.

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,831
Are you Bernie LaPlanta?

133
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,829
LaPlante. Bernie LaPlante.

134
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,431
You the guys that Bunny called?

135
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,875
Three hours is old, man. Very old.

136
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,874
He might not have reported them
at all yet. He might not know.

137
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,111
What did you do? Pick his pocket?

138
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,750
More or less.

139
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,230
Trust me. These are very, very fresh.

140
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,473
To be honest with you, it doesn't
make sense to me either, Miss Gayley.

141
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,551
Things seem to be on the upswing.

142
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,315
Our difficulties with the SEC
have been favourably resolved.

143
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,837
In a business sense,
I think we've turned the corner.

144
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,152
Your wife and children are
on the way here. Don't you--

145
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,836
Thank you for coming out here
and letting me talk to you.

146
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,635
Oh, my God! Chucky, tilt down!

147
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,348
Did you get it?

148
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,955
Jesus! Did I say that?

149
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,238
Yeah, I got it!

150
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,034
Sports training.
Learn to follow the ball!

151
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,273
Listen, how about you do
your wrap-up from up here?

152
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,435
I'll pull back from that skyscraper,
find you here, then reveal the drop.

153
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,676
Suicide number 137 of this year,
in this city...

154
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,354
...was neither a destitute,
nor a lonely man...

155
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,433
...but a successful executive
with a loving family...

156
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,915
...and 40 million dollars in the bank.

157
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,634
If there's nameless despair
in executive offices...

158
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,634
...what can there be 60 stories below,
where the hungry and the homeless...

159
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,549
... the brutalized and the addicted,
fight their daily battle for survival?

160
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,030
From a ledge 60 stories
above the street...

161
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,754
...I'm Gale Gayley for Channel 4 News.

162
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,071
What'd you think of the fall shot?

163
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,471
The guy drops 20 stories
in perfect focus, centre frame...

164
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,830
...while I smoothly go
from F16 to F56.

165
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,152
Hell of a shot, Chucky.
It's beautiful. Parker!

166
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,960
Run this to Frazier.
Open with it at 6, 1 1 and 7 a.m.

167
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,079
Bet she pushed him just
for the great shot. Blind ambition.

168
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,073
Pushed him? Oh, my God.
Not really?

169
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,278
Conklin's jealous
because it wasn't his story.

170
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,829
It tore her up because
we couldn't save the guy.

171
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,792
She wanted to reach out.

172
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,876
Like the suicide?

173
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,633
-Never reach out.
-Mr. Wallace.

174
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,829
It's unprofessional.

175
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,832
You could get pulled over.

176
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,679
-What are we talking about?
-How we didn't save him.

177
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,555
Saving people is not our job.
It's wrong to step in and save someone.

178
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,835
You wouldn't push him?

179
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,632
I didn't say we should've saved him.

180
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,952
I said I wish it had occurred to me
to consider saving him.

181
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,668
-What good would that do?
-lt'd make me feel human.

182
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,474
It's not a bad story.
"Newswoman Saves Suicide."

183
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,393
-It's unprofessional.
-You can't bear good news.

184
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,876
-You're sitting on your ticket.
-Ticket? What's going on?

185
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,435
She's flying to N.Y.
for a Silver Mike Award.

186
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,632
Silver Mike?
You are covering us in glory.

187
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,836
Well, I haven't won yet.

188
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,749
You have me scheduled on a flight back
an hour after the ceremony.

189
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,959
For heaven's sake, let's give her
a night in N.Y.C. Listen.

190
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,639
We'll put her boyfriend--

191
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,671
She broke up with her boyfriend.

192
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,470
We need you back
to follow up on that jumper.

193
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,595
The human interest in the unending woe
pouring from the wounded metropolis.

194
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,876
-The dirt, you mean?
-That too.

195
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,150
Would you put me up
in a really good hotel?

196
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,276
Absolutely.

197
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,033
So long, babe.

198
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,759
Okay, the hell with it.

199
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,436
Party on. Is that what they say?

200
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,438
I'll figure something out.

201
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,675
She's pretending to be a person.
She's a reporter.

202
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,956
$50 says she'll be back
on the first flight.

203
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,755
I don't understand what you mean
by "technicality," Mr. LaPlante.

204
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,878
You were found guilty
by a jury of your peers.

205
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,511
The cops didn't follow
the correct procedure with the evidence.

206
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,598
That should have been
established by your attorney.

207
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,157
I'm broke. I got this court-appointed
lawyer. She don't know nothing.

208
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,679
Mr. LaPlante...

209
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,596
...my job is to make a recommendation
for sentencing, based on this interview.

210
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,631
I'm not a criminal.

211
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,348
Buying stolen goods?
It's a little technical thing.

212
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,273
Do I rob anybody? Do I hit anybody?

213
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,670
Don't clutter up prisons
with guys like me.

214
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,512
Prisons are for tough guys.

215
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,438
Prisons are for guys who like
to beat each other up.

216
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,151
I can't do that kind of time. I don't
belong in that kind of environment.

217
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,628
Give me a break.

218
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,034
Look.

219
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,829
I got this kid, 9, 10 years old.

220
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,554
I'm taking him to the movies
tonight after work.

221
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,279
He worships me.

222
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,830
If I go to the slammer,
what's this going to do to the kid?

223
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,232
I'm his goddamn role model,
for chrissake.

224
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,633
I don't have to explain how much my
cameraman, editor, assignment editor...

225
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,072
...and news director, to name a few,
did to get me this award.

226
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,438
This is an onion.

227
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,555
It's a metaphor for a news story.

228
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,634
A few hours ago, I was standing on
a ledge 60 stories above the street...

229
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,628
...interviewing a man who subsequently
jumped to his death.

230
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,038
Forty million dollars in the bank,
happily married, good health.

231
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,838
Great story.

232
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,950
But there's got to be more.
I mean, we're pros, right?

233
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,193
Some kind of extramarital
hanky-panky, maybe?

234
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,668
Another great story.

235
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,359
Maybe the guy's been accused
of child molesting.

236
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,238
A terrific story.

237
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,079
What? It turns out
the accusations were false?

238
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,436
Wonderful. More story.

239
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,833
Maybe the alleged mistress was lying.
Setting the guy up, huh?

240
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,031
Sensational story.

241
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,276
So we keep going.

242
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,078
Excuse me. Keep digging.

243
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,628
Keep investigating.

244
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,956
We expose the guy's whole life.
His family.

245
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,872
Why? Because we're pros.

246
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,230
Because we're looking for the truth.

247
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,439
But what if it turns out,
after all our digging...

248
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,558
...after all our
painstaking investigation....

249
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,473
What if it turns out
there wasn't any truth?

250
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,073
Just stories.

251
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,073
One story after another,
until there's nothing left.

252
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,959
And do we have any obligation
to stop at any point?

253
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,830
Or do we just keep going, digging,
peeling until we've peeled it all away?

254
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,436
Until we've destroyed what
we investigated in the first place.

255
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,159
I'll bet all of you, like me...

256
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,277
...yearn for just one story...

257
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,115
...that isn't about unveiling
layer after layer of human weakness.

258
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,753
A story that reveals,
with each layer of investigation...

259
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,629
...something finer and nobler.

260
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,439
Something even inspirational.

261
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,039
No, it's very nice, actually.

262
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,837
"For Excellence
in the Pursuit of Truth."

263
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,839
Listen, I got a seat back
on the early flight after all. So....

264
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,673
What? What do you mean
you gave it to Conklin?

265
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,673
He wasn't the one
the guy wanted to talk to!

266
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,871
You were gonna do the town, remember?

267
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,829
Fancy suite at the station's expense,
see a show, maybe get laid.

268
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,349
-What was I supposed to do?
-Cut the shit!

269
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,878
I'm not gonna hang around N. Y. while
you give away my stories to Conklin!

270
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,436
You get back tonight, doll.
I'll take Conklin off your suicide.

271
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,632
Fly carefully.
Congratulations on the award.

272
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,438
What did I tell you?
They're all alike, the good ones.

273
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,077
They're junkies for the story.
Can't let go.

274
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,149
First rule out here on the streets is,
watch out for number one.

275
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,076
If you go down, you break a bone,
you're gone. Nobody'll pick you up.

276
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,679
Shitty colour.

277
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,677
Look at the skin tones.

278
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,509
Chrissake. Homeless people are
supposed to have shitty skin tones.

279
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,555
There you go. Skin tones.

280
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,469
I wouldn't even do this
if I didn't have legal problems.

281
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,110
Ninety-five dollars, that's it.
I got to get out of here.

282
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,116
I gotta take my kid to the movies.

283
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,550
-I'm late. My kid's waiting.
-Fifty.

284
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,634
How about a watch? Wanna buy a watch?

285
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,398
Same kind I got, huh?

286
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,273
Tell you what. Give me $85
for the machine, the watch.

287
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,071
I'll throw in a couple of wheel covers,
a case of insect repellent. Here.

288
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,629
You need an air filter?

289
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,636
I could've predicted this.

290
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,474
It's raining because
my wipers are all fucked up.

291
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,430
If my wipers were okay, the fucking sun
would be shining at night.

292
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,714
Damn it!

293
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,514
Damn it!

294
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,752
We're experiencing a high reading
on one of our indicators.

295
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,992
Probably a malfunction in the gauge,
but as a precaution...

296
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,230
...fasten your seat belts while we
run you through some safety procedures.

297
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,439
First, make sure that your seat belts
are fastened securely.

298
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,473
When the captain gives the signal,
brace your arms...

299
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,638
...against the seat in front
of you like this.

300
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,075
You may use pillows and blankets...

301
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,998
...to protect your face...

302
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,873
...from flying glass and debris.

303
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,193
Before you do, remove
your eyeglasses and your shoes....

304
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,950
Remember, our biggest asset
in an emergency is calm, clear thinking.

305
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,156
All of us on the crew have been
carefully trained for emergencies....

306
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,993
Come on! Come on!

307
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,039
I'm late already. Don't quit on me now.

308
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,232
Come on! Come on!

309
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,315
Now what?

310
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,039
Somebody!

311
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,435
Is anybody out there?

312
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,756
Is anybody there?

313
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,116
What's the problem, pal?

314
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,355
Just stay calm everyone!
Everyone, please!

315
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,949
Stay calm! Please don't push!

316
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,155
Everyone, please!

317
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,233
Everything will be all right
if we just stay calm!

318
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,639
I can't move.

319
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,475
-I'm trapped.
-Get me out of here!

320
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,591
Mommy! Mommy!

321
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,472
Help! We're stuck!

322
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,154
Hold it. Hold it. Just a minute.

323
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,749
Please, Daddy!

324
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,672
Wake up, Daddy!

325
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,472
Please wake up.

326
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,432
Somebody's coming.

327
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,792
Hey, mister. Mister?
Can you give us a hand?

328
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,036
Hold on, buddy!

329
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,233
We're talking $100 shoes here.

330
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,636
Shit!

331
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,239
Shit!

332
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,033
Help us! Please!

333
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,277
The handle's jammed!

334
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,869
You've gotta push on the door!

335
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,276
-You've gotta push hard!
-What do you think I'm doing?

336
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,438
Harder! Again! Come on.

337
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,717
-Push!
-I'm pushing it.

338
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,793
-Harder!
-I'm pushing it, asshole!

339
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,870
Come on! One at a time!

340
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,071
Don't push!

341
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,030
When you get out, move as far away
from the plane as possible.

342
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,840
Please, one at a time.
One at a time, please.

343
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,793
Please, miss. My father can't move.
He can't move!

344
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,672
We'll try to help him.
Wait outside.

345
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,037
Move as far away from
the plane as you can.

346
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,040
One at a time. Let's go! Let's go!

347
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,549
There's a woman back there.
She's trapped!

348
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,073
You get as far away
from the plane as you can.

349
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,676
Daddy!

350
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,038
Where's my shoes?

351
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,831
Where are my shoes?

352
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,235
Daddy, please!

353
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,273
Sir, please!

354
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,033
My dad can't move!

355
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,468
Where? Where is he?

356
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,278
In there. He's hurt!

357
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,672
The cops are coming and the firemen.
They got equipment and stuff.

358
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,639
They're experts.
Where are my shoes?

359
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,837
Please, sir. Please.

360
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,630
It's on fire. He can't move.

361
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,433
Oh, for chrissake.

362
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,073
What's his name?

363
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,238
-Fletcher! Where are you?
-You can't come back in.

364
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,436
Where are you, fella?

365
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,633
Are you Fletcher?

366
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,309
Who are you?

367
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,399
Come on.

368
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,354
Hey! Somebody grab him, will you?

369
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,158
Help this guy, will you?

370
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,310
-Help him!
-Get him!

371
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,835
Get him away from the plane!

372
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,629
Get as far away from
the plane as you can!

373
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,633
Where are you? Hey, buddy.
Goddamn it!

374
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,711
Fletcher, speak up.
Don't be an asshole.

375
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,075
Oh, shit.

376
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,313
My leg is caught.

377
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,235
My leg is caught.

378
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,039
Can you get me out of here?

379
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,038
Oh, sure. Yeah, I think.

380
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,679
Let me help you there.

381
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,632
Give me a hand, lady.
I'm not a goddamn bodybuilder.

382
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,636
Get away from the plane quickly.
It may explode!

383
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,838
Give me a hand here, will you, honey?

384
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,436
Move this piece of shit
out of here now.

385
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,033
Come on!

386
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,032
Dad!

387
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,274
-Dad!
-Son.

388
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,238
Thank God!

389
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,512
Look out! It's ready to go!

390
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,235
-Put her on your shoulder.
-You better get out of here!

391
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,873
-You too, miss.
-Fletcher!

392
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,633
I've lost count.

393
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,236
-Right away!
-I think everybody's out.

394
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,835
Where are you?

395
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,357
Here! I'm over here. Help me.

396
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,874
-Where are you?
-Here.

397
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,032
-Where?
-My leg is broken. I need help.

398
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,235
-Fletcher, right?
-Smith.

399
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,870
-You're not Fletcher?
-I'm Smith. Please help me.

400
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,759
Fuck this!
I'm looking for Fletcher.

401
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,231
No, don't leave me!
Please don't leave me.

402
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,033
Oh, all right.

403
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,035
Come here.

404
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,636
-Hold on. Come on.
-Oh, thank God.

405
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,593
Don't count your chickens, Smith.
I can't see shit!

406
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,279
Come out!
It's ready to blow!

407
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,273
-There's another guy in there!
-Right goddamn now!

408
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,514
-Hey, you!
-Get out of there!

409
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,439
Hey, you! Give me a hand here.
Come here!

410
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,238
-I'll help him.
-I got this guy.

411
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,351
I'll help him. You run for it.

412
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,432
-There's a guy in there!
-She's gonna explode!

413
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,478
There's a guy--
You're supposed to be a fireman!

414
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,999
She's gonna go!

415
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,599
Come on!

416
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,634
Get back! It's gonna go!

417
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,319
Come on, you stupid shit!

418
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,636
I lost my other shoe.

419
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,839
Get back!

420
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,629
-I need a medic here!
-Yes. Yes. Angle on fireman.

421
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,029
Jonesy!

422
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,593
Heroic. Backlit.

423
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,035
Blazing inferno! Look at that.
Awesome!

424
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,474
Major awards.

425
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,837
He stands his ground,
capturing images of raging flames...

426
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,833
...with no regard for
his own personal safety.

427
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,833
Go, Chucky.

428
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,837
Go, baby.

429
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,838
Sorry, Fletcher.

430
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,236
What a way to go, pal.

431
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,436
I'm okay.

432
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,238
-You're not okay.
-I'm a reporter.

433
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,273
-She's got a broken arm.
-It's my leg. My leg hurts.

434
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,670
Chucky! Chucky!

435
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,195
Holy shit! It's Gayley. Gayley!

436
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,879
-Hold up.
-You were on the plane?

437
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,275
It's my story, Conk.
I did the research.

438
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,272
Get the attendant
who manned the door.

439
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,080
Also, some passenger pulled me out.
Talk to him!

440
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,748
-Then get to the hospital.
-She's a piece of work.

441
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,436
Unbelievable. "It's my story.
I did the research"?

442
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,438
You wouldn't believe the shot I got.
Major award.

443
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,279
I start in this fireman's face.
Fantastic!

444
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,078
You know, sad but excited.

445
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,836
Where's my car?

446
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,514
My car was right here.

447
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,836
-Where's my--?
-Where are you hurt?

448
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,232
Where are you hurt?
Why don't we go over to the ambulance?

449
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,638
I don't need an ambulance. I'm looking
for my car. It must've burnt up.

450
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,832
You weren't in your car.
You've been in a plane crash.

451
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,436
Please! My daughter needs
medical attention.

452
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,831
-He waited for hours.
-You won't believe it.

453
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,674
-I'm tired of your bullshit!
-It's not my fault.

454
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,275
It's never your fault! Never, ever!

455
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,670
You screwed up my life
and now your son's.

456
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,878
And you'll never accept
responsibility for anything!

457
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,758
Is your friend, the fireman, here?

458
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,117
He had an emergency call.
A real emergency!

459
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,233
Why don't you let me in, instead of
waking up the whole neighbourhood?

460
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,155
If you let me talk,
I'll tell you what happened.

461
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,238
What happened is the same thing
that always happens.

462
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,831
You blew it. Only this time, you broke
your son's heart instead of mine.

463
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,635
He was looking forward to
going to the movies with his father.

464
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,798
And you let him down
like you let everyone down, always.

465
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,199
Did you take a mud bath?

466
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,673
That's what I'm trying to--

467
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,313
Shut up, Bernie!

468
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,155
Forget it. Let me talk to Joey
to apologize.

469
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,837
He's in bed. And you won't wake him up
and make him crazy. Understand?

470
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,232
He comes home and wants to know
if Elliott's a war hero, like you.

471
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,433
-He wants to know how many you killed.
-Elliott? Elliott, the fireman.

472
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,154
I had to explain your tendency
to exaggerate.

473
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,837
How you killed as many people as
the other supply clerks in your outfit.

474
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,471
-I didn't say I killed anyone.
-Whatever! You let him believe it!

475
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,154
Then I had to explain
about the homeless.

476
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,358
How not all of them own
apartment complexes.

477
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,431
How not all of them
play the stock market.

478
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,433
How not all of them rent babies
when panhandling.

479
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,676
He's a young boy, Bernie.

480
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,876
Impressionable!

481
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,951
Listen, Ev, it's important.

482
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,077
-I gotta see him.
-Use the phone.

483
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,033
-I've got important reasons.
-He'd love to hear from you.

484
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,838
What happened to your shoe?

485
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,197
No, I don't wanna know.
Some fantastic adventure, right?

486
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,038
Something really crazy?

487
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,635
All I was doing was
giving him advice.

488
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,233
Preparing him for life.

489
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,228
You don't want him to grow up soft,
do you? It's tough out there.

490
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,839
It's a goddamn jungle.

491
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,071
Well, back to the jungle, Bernie.

492
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,912
Sorry, Ev, to bother you again.
This is for Joey.

493
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,039
A reward...

494
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,151
...for this wallet he found.

495
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,837
When I returned it, I told the guy
that he had to give my kid something...

496
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,433
...for finding it.

497
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:31,156
You know, for the honesty.
So the kid would learn how honesty pays.

498
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,678
Do you want to give it to him,
or should l?

499
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,514
Moron.

500
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,078
You actually went into
a burning aeroplane?

501
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,760
Into it? I was practically
living in the goddamn thing.

502
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,352
Into it? I was practically
living in the goddamn thing.

503
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,034
Every time I turned,
someone wants me to save them.

504
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,232
I couldn't see a foot in front of me.
Then suddenly...

505
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,670
...boom! It explodes.
I could be dead.

506
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,798
But you pulled people out.
You're a hero.

507
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,958
No, I fucked it up.
I was trying to impress this kid.

508
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,830
I was gonna rescue his old man but l
couldn't find him. He must've blew up.

509
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,756
I got out of there.
I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.

510
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,518
A lot of people wouldn't have tried.
It was a brave thing.

511
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,398
Yeah, try stupid.

512
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,230
Just toss them in the back, please.

513
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,072
A lot of people would say
that's what heroism is...

514
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,833
...stupidity.

515
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,958
Doing something that,
if you thought about it...

516
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,839
...you wouldn't do it.
It's not in your interest.

517
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,039
One more.

518
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,431
All right. Is everything all right?

519
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,676
I guess you kind of got
a drinking problem.

520
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,079
I sell them at the recycling centre.
It gives me a bit for gas and food.

521
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,032
Looks like you live in here.

522
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,508
I do in bad weather.

523
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,510
But mostly, I like
camping in the woods.

524
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,671
I thought you were
down on your luck too.

525
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,634
"Down on my luck"? I told you.
A goddamn plane fell on me...

526
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,917
...from out of the sky, in America,
for chrissake.

527
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,829
See these shoes? $100 pair
of shoes. One shoe.

528
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,876
-Give it to someone with one leg.
-One leg? Let me off. I'll take a bus.

529
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,078
I know a man who sells stuff
at the recycling centre.

530
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,437
He only has one leg.
I think it's the right foot.

531
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,229
Sell it to him. You get a couple bucks.
It pays for the gas.

532
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,436
He doesn't have any money.

533
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,359
It's very kind of you.

534
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,629
"Down on my luck."

535
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,117
I got some mud on me is all.
I got a nice apartment, stereo.

536
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,276
We could listen to you on the news.

537
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,436
Are you worried about
the stock market?

538
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,995
No, the plane crash.
Didn't they interview you?

539
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,468
I don't give no interviews.

540
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,029
That's a lot of shit.

541
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,831
Keep a low profile.

542
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,479
That's my motto.

543
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,238
I got legal problems. My attorneys
don't like me talking to the media.

544
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,876
Step on it. I'm supposed to be
in my office five minutes ago.

545
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,475
My secretary...

546
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,831
...has got appointments
booked for me, you know, all day.

547
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,916
I'm very late.

548
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,238
One word. One word, LaPlante,
and you're fired. You got that?

549
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,833
-Bill--
-Don't say "Bill"!

550
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,429
Didn't I say,
"One word and you're fired"?

551
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,470
Know why? Because it'll be an excuse.
"Bernie LaPlante, excuse number 4,106."

552
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,951
No, 4,1 12. That's how many
excuses you've given me.

553
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,475
I keep track of them electronically.

554
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,439
-I got legal problems.
-You talked! You're fired!

555
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,596
Out of here! Out of here!

556
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,028
Jesus Christ!

557
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,959
I got people waiting.
I got orders coming in.

558
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,270
And you, you're gonna
go out like that?

559
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,670
Meet the public in
stocking fucking feet?

560
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,830
I have problems.

561
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,474
I don't care about your problems.
I care about mine...

562
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,836
...and you're one of my problems.
Now get out!

563
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,473
I was driving my car--

564
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,551
I don't want to hear anymore.

565
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,712
-A plane fell on my head.
-Yeah, I'll be on your head.

566
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,468
I don't understand.
You can't find him?

567
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,956
There's a lot of confusion
around what took place, Gale.

568
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,953
But you said all the passengers
were accounted for.

569
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,111
The guy who pulled you out
wasn't a passenger.

570
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,629
A fireman, a paramedic?
He didn't have a uniform.

571
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,638
From what we could get,
there's a kind of...

572
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,038
...sort of, a mystery guy involved.

573
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,397
We're piecing together
different accounts.

574
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,233
A mystery guy.

575
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,474
Not a passenger. Who?

576
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,632
We don't know who he is. He....

577
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,074
He disappeared.

578
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,035
A non-passenger, non-rescue worker...

579
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,032
...went into a burning plane...

580
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,158
...and pulled me out and disappeared?

581
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,358
This guy's the one who
opened the emergency exit...

582
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,039
...from the outside.

583
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,590
Saved everyone on the plane.
Because of him, no fatalities.

584
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,473
I don't think you should be
moving around like that.

585
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,153
Chucky, where's your camera?

586
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,799
Get this thing.

587
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,479
-Bring that.
-Easy.

588
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,749
All of a sudden...

589
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,992
...this civilian
rushes into the plane.

590
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,119
What did he look like?

591
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,278
It was just this face, all dirty.

592
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,714
It just appeared.

593
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,592
He was asking for Mr. Fletcher.

594
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,633
My son and I got separated in...

595
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,075
...the confusion and smoke.

596
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,949
The very courageous stewardess
told me my boy had gotten out.

597
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,838
So I got out too.

598
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,632
But my son had already
told this man...

599
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,038
...that I was still in there.

600
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,916
I thought my dad was still...

601
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,034
...still in there. So I asked
the man to save my father.

602
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,596
What did the man say, Richie?

603
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,998
He said....

604
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,436
He said:

605
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,029
"I'll save him." He said,
"I'll save your father."

606
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,316
Thanks.

607
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,036
I need a medic here!

608
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,793
I need a medic!

609
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,991
Jonesy!

610
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,233
-Shit!
-Now freeze. Go back, you missed it.

611
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,992
Keep going, keep going.

612
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,156
Back.

613
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,593
Now, go forward again.
Missed it again.

614
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,594
There.

615
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,398
Right there.

616
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,956
That's him?

617
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,989
Who else? We've accounted
for everybody else.

618
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,391
-That's our hero.
-I didn't even notice him.

619
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,195
I was into the foreground drama.
Heroic fireman, looming in the frame.

620
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,715
Can we do some kind of
electronic enhancement?

621
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,235
Get a clear picture?
Identify him?

622
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,596
Far out.

623
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,872
Never saw him.

624
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,317
It's the camera.
It has a life of its own.

625
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,030
At times I feel as if we were one,
capturing little moments...

626
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,316
...of history in a kaleidoscope...

627
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,596
...of colours and drama.

628
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,235
There's no face.

629
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,198
There's nothing to work with.

630
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,994
Big dots. That's all
you're gonna get.

631
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,195
Look at that guy.

632
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,951
He just saved 54 people.

633
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,994
And now he's gonna disappear.

634
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,395
Who is he?

635
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,399
"I'll save him. "
He said, "I'll save your father. "

636
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,791
All of a sudden, this civilian...

637
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,232
...he rushed into the plane.

638
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,837
Leslie, the other flight attendant,
told me the guy dragged me...

639
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,035
... to the exit.

640
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,993
"Here, give this guy
a hand, " he said.

641
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,398
And the next thing I knew...

642
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,030
...he was going back in there.

643
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,793
Into all that smoke.

644
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,596
Out of the darkness.
Out of the smoke...

645
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,196
...and the fear,
came a man with no name.

646
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,799
No uniform...

647
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,036
...but an abundance of courage.

648
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,716
A man who was thinking not about
himself, but about others.

649
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,394
Risking his own life for ours.

650
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,594
He's out there now, somewhere...

651
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,312
...and whoever you are...

652
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,432
...I and the other survivors
of Flight 104 say...

653
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,195
... thank you. God bless you.

654
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:55,198
If you're gonna wear a cast, feature
it more. It's part of the story.

655
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,789
Network wants to feed off our 6:00...

656
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,031
...whether we find the guy or not.

657
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,038
It's a wonderful piece.
Emotional. I love it.

658
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,508
We'll feature Gale's cast.

659
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,399
My cast is only interesting until
the hero shows up.

660
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,919
Then whoever has him, has the story.

661
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,434
Good reason for you
to find him.

662
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,999
You should be out digging.

663
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,839
We could help her out.
How about offering a reward?

664
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,638
In return for
an exclusive interview.

665
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,916
Money and news. Dangerous waters.

666
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,469
He's right. We don't even
know what he looks like.

667
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,036
Of course you know what he looks like.
He saved you, right?

668
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,315
They found what?

669
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,028
A phone check with survivors has
confirmed that the shoe...

670
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,239
...does not belong to any of
the passengers or crew of Flight 104.

671
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,278
However, several witnesses recall
the mysterious man...

672
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,910
...who saved 54 people, referring
to his missing shoe.

673
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,434
The conclusion is...

674
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,832
... the unknown hero, known to many
as the Angel of Flight 104...

675
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,991
-...wears a size 10B.
-Joey!

676
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,800
Dinner, now!
Turn that thing off!

677
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,598
Mom! Mom!

678
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,593
He lost his shoe!
He lost his shoe!

679
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,198
-He lost his shoe.
-Who did?

680
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,230
The unknown hero.

681
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,038
Wash your hands.

682
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,510
They found his shoe right beside
the plane crash.

683
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,638
Superman, you mean? Lost his shoe?
What next?

684
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,792
Elliott, the man saved
hundreds of people.

685
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,115
Fifty-four.

686
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,396
I was there, remember?

687
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,512
You know why none of us
rushed in that plane?

688
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,796
Because we're trained firemen,
that's why.

689
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,395
Part of a team, a disciplined team.

690
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,909
We take chances all the time,
save people's lives.

691
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,798
But we don't do crazy things.

692
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,396
This guy does something
really dumb and he lucks out.

693
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,592
So the media go crazy over
his shoe, for God's sakes!

694
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,995
What message are they
giving to the youth?

695
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,191
What message are you
giving to the youth?

696
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,432
Sneering at someone
for sticking his neck out.

697
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,433
You sound like my ex,
for heaven's sake. Mr. Cynicism.

698
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,635
So what can I say?

699
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,913
Give your ex credit for being smart
enough not to do something stupid.

700
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,798
Maybe the guy's not all bad.

701
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,999
I'm gonna watch TV and hope it's not
all this "Superman" stuff.

702
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,194
My father only had one shoe on...

703
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,589
...when he came here.

704
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,997
You were in bed, weren't you?

705
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,789
I saw him out the window.

706
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,870
You think he would do
something like that?

707
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,991
Rescue people?

708
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,874
Your father is Bernie LaPlante.

709
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,631
It's against his religion
to stick his neck out.

710
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,877
Sit down.

711
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,192
The warden of a Montana prison
insists the unknown hero...

712
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,592
...is a child molester who escaped
from the institution in April.

713
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,230
In Scotland, the leader of
a religious sect claims...

714
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:48,190
... the mysterious hero is, in fact,
an angel anticipated in scripture.

715
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,793
Hey, Bernie!

716
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,797
-How's it going?
-You don't wanna know.

717
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,797
You don't wanna know.

718
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,716
Those guys been in yet?

719
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,155
You in business with
them guys or what?

720
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,998
I wouldn't want a
problem for the bar.

721
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,798
You couldn't have a problem...

722
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,039
...because I personally have got
them all. I cornered the whole market.

723
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,316
You wouldn't believe what
I've been through.

724
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,393
You know, I was taking my car
to get my kid--

725
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,516
How you doing?

726
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,593
-Brought some friends, okay?
-Yeah, sure.

727
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,793
Excuse me, Chick.

728
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,638
In addition, we bring you
a special announcement from...

729
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,233
...Channel 4, station manager...

730
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,198
...James Wallace.

731
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,513
Good evening.

732
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,398
We at Channel 4, like you,
have been...

733
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,636
...stirred by the courage
and the humanity....

734
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,030
Mi amigo. What do you got?
More plastic?

735
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,838
Yeah, plastic.

736
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,638
Premium stuff here. High limits.

737
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,711
Not reported.

738
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,393
How do you know?

739
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,392
Because I know. Trust me on this.

740
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,194
Hombre, he don't trust
his mother. Why you?

741
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,590
Because I'm not his mother.

742
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,755
Por aqui?

743
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,996
But then again, like you...

744
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,634
...we want to see what is best in us.

745
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,472
We want to examine it.

746
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,234
For that reason, we at
Channel 4 will offer...

747
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,069
... this unknown hero
a reward of $1 million.

748
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,436
How many of these you got?
Eight? Ten?

749
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,636
They're gonna give that
guy $1 million.

750
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,233
-Who?
-That plane crash guy.

751
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,833
-A million bucks?
-That's right.

752
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,600
-ls this all of them, 8?
-What plane crash guy?

753
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,234
The one-shoe dude.
The guy that saved those people.

754
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,948
Channel 4's gonna give
this guy $1 million...

755
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,713
...just for an interview!

756
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,391
A million bucks!

757
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,394
Hombre! We're trying to
do some business here.

758
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,393
-You got more of these?
-A million dollars?

759
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,192
I'm the guy.

760
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,239
I got an appointment.
I gotta--

761
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,436
Bullshit!

762
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,033
LaPlante, you're under arrest!

763
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,076
You have the right--

764
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,635
Don't you know who I am?
Where I got the plastic?

765
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,400
I got a million bucks
from the jet!

766
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,271
Bullshit! I got a million bucks!

767
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,274
One million dollars
to anonymous hero!

768
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,593
One million bucks to angel
who saved 50 people takes off!

769
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:22,436
Now, please! If your foot isn't a
size 10B, don't remain in line!

770
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,319
We're only looking for size 10B heroes!

771
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,709
Me, a liar?
I'll kick your ass!

772
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,791
It ain't just me saying you
ain't the hero!

773
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,230
Everybody in line
knows you're not the hero!

774
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,038
That's a racist perspective.

775
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,795
Assuming because something heroic
was done, a white man done it.

776
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,918
A man with mud on his face
could be a man of any colour.

777
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,435
Most likely was, which is true
in this case...

778
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,999
...because it was me!

779
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,838
With mud all over me!

780
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,229
Can you believe this?

781
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,233
There must be a thousand
phonies here after my reward!

782
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,040
Miss Gayley! It's me!
The guy who saved your life!

783
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,110
It's me, remember?

784
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,670
I'm only an 8 1/2, but I wear
a 10 for comfort, I swear!

785
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,110
A cop's here
for you from robbery detail.

786
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,839
Inspector Dayton.
He wants you to call.

787
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,234
-What about?
-I didn't ask.

788
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,199
Call back and find out, okay?
I'm really busy!

789
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,832
Bail in this matter will
remain at $5,000.

790
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,029
Next!

791
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,435
The Angel of Flight 104?
You're the angel--

792
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,511
Angel? I didn't say angel.

793
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,433
I gotta get over to the TV station
and get my million.

794
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,069
-Mr. LaPlante--
-The People vs. LaPlante.

795
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,992
That's me! I'm Mr. LaPlante!

796
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,033
The D.A. is asking that
your bail be set...

797
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,555
...at $25,000.
$25,000!

798
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,631
Because you were arrested again.

799
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,190
Twenty-five grand is peanuts! You
just gotta get me out to collect--

800
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,830
Your honour! The prosecutor
wants $25,000 for bail.

801
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,674
You will be silent until
the court recognizes you.

802
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,831
Fine by me.
I got no problem with that.

803
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,435
In fact, your honour, I'd be
proud to double it.

804
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,399
Fifty grand. For The People.
Like a tip.

805
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,839
-Mr. LaPlante--
-What do you say?

806
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:02,631
If you don't stop chattering
immediately, I will ask the bailiff--

807
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,038
I said I want...

808
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,353
...order!!

809
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,036
-Sorry, sir.
-We got carried away.

810
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,077
-They found him!
-Found who?

811
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,311
The Angel of Flight 104.

812
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,749
It was on the news, sir.
Just now.

813
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,798
He's gonna be on Channel 4 at noon.

814
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,997
We'll sustain the bail at $25,000.

815
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,798
That ought to keep you
out of trouble.

816
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,310
-Your honour, my client is--
-Your client is a pain in the ass!

817
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,869
Twelve noon, huh? Channel 4.

818
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,991
I was out in the woods...

819
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,795
...and I heard a huge crash.

820
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,036
And I saw...

821
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,639
...flames.

822
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,394
And I went over there
to take a look.

823
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,754
And everything there was...

824
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,598
...Iike a blur.

825
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,430
There was a lot of smoke...

826
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,989
...and screaming.

827
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,592
I was relieved that it was just
a plane crash, and I could help.

828
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,789
But I don't have a detailed
memory of it. It was too scary.

829
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,112
Tell us why you disappeared, John.

830
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,398
Well, that's--

831
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,797
At first, I didn't know
I was the hero. I thought...

832
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,318
... the boy's father hadn't survived...

833
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,597
...and I had failed him
and I couldn't....

834
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,394
I couldn't face the boy.
And then...

835
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,191
...after that...

836
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,715
...well, I've been....

837
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,793
I've been down on my luck lately.

838
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,669
I just didn't really feel
too presentable.

839
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,638
But finally, you did come forward.

840
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,993
Why?

841
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,998
The money.

842
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,798
I wouldn't have come forward
if it wasn't for...

843
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,590
-...if it wasn't for the money.
-Go back.

844
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:43,796
Cut!

845
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,439
Right there.

846
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,193
Right on that look.

847
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,033
You didn't tell me he
was so cute.

848
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,759
He saved my life.

849
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,034
The survivors were shocked to learn
that the hero who appeared...

850
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,032
...and pulled them to safety
was indigent...

851
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,317
...and hadn't slept in a bed
in more than three years.

852
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,791
John Bubber was living in his car
at the time of the crash.

853
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,759
Eking out a meagre existence
by collecting cans....

854
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,631
-He's a fake.
-You know him?

855
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,996
He's a goddamn fake.
He's a bum.

856
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,953
He's a goddamn homeless bum!

857
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,993
He ain't no hero.
You can trust me on that.

858
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,468
Trust you!

859
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,190
What do you mean,
cutting down the homeless?

860
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,954
What do you know about the homeless?

861
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,192
You know, I thought they'd all go,
"It's him!" and wanna hug the guy.

862
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,228
Relax. He had the shoe,
and the shoe checked out.

863
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,438
I can stop worrying?
Where are we putting him up?

864
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,035
Drake Hotel.
And never stop worrying.

865
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,431
We'll do a sidebar on going from
sleeping in your car...

866
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,511
...to sleeping in a posh suite.

867
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,593
Also, Gale's checking into
his background.

868
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,195
What's it gonna be?
Dirt or more poetry?

869
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,192
We know which one you'd prefer.

870
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,000
Inspector Dayton recovered
your credit cards--

871
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,038
-Who?
-lnspector Dayton, from robbery detail.

872
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,913
They caught the guy
who stole your credit cards--

873
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,196
Nobody stole them.
They were burned up.

874
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,000
You got my money?
What about the reservations?

875
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,794
Two at 8, at the Barcelona.

876
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:22,192
-Four hundred dollars for dinner?
-She's taking Mr. Bubber to dinner.

877
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,634
Bubber? To dinner?

878
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,632
That's a great idea! Chucky!

879
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,440
-Come in here.
-This is private and personal.

880
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,432
He's a news story, for Pete's sake.

881
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,398
He saved my life.
