1
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,522
Hi, everybody.
This is your cousin Brucie. Whoa!

2
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,661
Our summer romances are in full bloom,
and everybody's in love!

3
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:04,832
So cousins, here's a great song
from the Four Seasons.

4
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:14,912
That was the summer of 1963...

5
00:02:14,984 --> 00:02:18,545
when everybody called me ""Baby""
and it didn't occur to me to mind.

6
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:29,624
That was before
President Kennedy was shot...

7
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:31,667
before the Beatles came...

8
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,827
when I couldn't wait
to join the Peace Corps...

9
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:37,805
and I thought I'd never
find a guy as great as my dad.

10
00:02:47,283 --> 00:02:49,843
That was the summer
we went to Kellerman's.

11
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:12,064
Ping-Pong in the west arcade,
softball in the east diamond.

12
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:14,405
All you Sandy Koufaxes,
get out there!

13
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:16,945
Complimentary dance lessons
in the gazebo.

14
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:19,641
Oh, my God.
Look at that!

15
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:23,846
Mom, I should've brought the coral
shoes. You said I was taking too much.

16
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,548
Well, sweetheart,
you brought ten pairs.

17
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,114
But the coral shoes
matched that dress.

18
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:30,853
This is not a tragedy.

19
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:35,387
A tragedy is three men trapped in a mine
or police dogs used in Birmingham.

20
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,660
Monks burning themselves
in protest.

21
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:39,133
Butt out, Baby.

22
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:42,933
Okay, we got horseshoes
on the south lawn in 15 minutes!

23
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:45,975
We've got splish-splash
the water class down by the lake.

24
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:49,637
We have the still life art class.
We got volleyball and croquet.

25
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:52,272
And for you older folks,
we got sacks!

26
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:55,051
Doc!

27
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:56,382
Doc!

28
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,348
Max!

29
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:03,188
Doc, after all these years
I finally got you up on my mountain.

30
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,493
How's the blood pressure?

31
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:07,495
I want you girls to know...

32
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:10,964
if it were not for this man,
I'd be standing here dead.

33
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:14,235
- Billy, get the bags.
- Right away, Doc.

34
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:17,535
I kept the best cabin
for you and your beautiful girls.

35
00:04:21,277 --> 00:04:23,404
Hey, thanks a lot.

36
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:25,208
You want a job here?

37
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:28,409
There's a merengue class in
the gazebo in the next few minutes.

38
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:31,214
The greatest teacher.
Used to be a Rockette.

39
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:35,246
It's his first real vacation
in six years, Max. Take it easy.

40
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:38,226
Three weeks here,
it'll feel like a year.

41
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:41,855
One, two, three, four! Stomp
those grapes and stomp some more!

42
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:46,061
One, two, three, four!
Listen to the music!

43
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:47,568
Sorry.

44
00:04:47,637 --> 00:04:49,400
Move your caboose
and shake it loose!

45
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:53,272
One, two, three, four!
Start the train!

46
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,578
Come on, men!
Follow me into a round robin!

47
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:03,881
Ladies, the inner circle!

48
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,488
Come on, ladies!

49
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:20,025
God wouldn't have given you maracas
if he didn't want you to shake them!

50
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,104
Okay now, ladies,
when I say ""stop""...

51
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:30,168
you're gonna find
the man of your dreams.

52
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,509
Stop!

53
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:38,313
Remember, he's the boss on
the dance floor, if nowhere else.

54
00:05:47,196 --> 00:05:50,461
Mom, Dad, I'm going up
to the main house to look around.

55
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:30,801
There are two kinds of help here.

56
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:33,034
You waiters are
all college guys...

57
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:37,011
and I went to Harvard
and Yale to hire you.

58
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,049
And why did I do that? Why?

59
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,282
I shouldn't have to remind you.
This is a family place.

60
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:48,153
That means you keep your fingers out
of the water, hair out of the soup...

61
00:06:48,224 --> 00:06:50,385
and show the goddamn
daughters a good time.

62
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:52,660
All the daughters.

63
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,324
Even the dogs.

64
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,163
Schlepp 'em out to the terrace,
show 'em the stars.

65
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:01,533
- Romance 'em any way you want.
- Got that, guys?

66
00:07:01,604 --> 00:07:03,572
Hey, hold it!
Hold it.

67
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:09,104
Well, if it isn't
the entertainment staff.

68
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,510
Listen, wise ass,
you got your own rules.

69
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:13,742
Dance with the daughters.
Teach 'em the mambo...

70
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:16,478
the cha-cha,
anything they pay for.

71
00:07:16,552 --> 00:07:18,144
That's it.

72
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:20,382
That's where it ends.

73
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:24,119
No funny business, no conversations,
and keep you hands off!

74
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:30,726
It's the same at all these places. Some
ass in the woods, but no conversation.

75
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,734
Watch it, Rodriguez.

76
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:38,873
Can you keep that straight, Johnny?
What you can't lay your hands on?

77
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,079
Just put your pickle on everybody's
plate, and leave the hard stuff to me.

78
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:56,316
Sit down and I'll
get you some wine.

79
00:07:57,193 --> 00:07:58,717
Thank you, Max.

80
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:03,761
This is Dr. and Mrs. Houseman.

81
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:07,894
Baby, Lisa, this is your waiter,
Robbie Gould.

82
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,666
Yale medical school.

83
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,642
These people are my special guests.
Give them anything they want.

84
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,644
- Enjoy.
- Thanks, Max.

85
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,582
Look at all this leftover food. Are
there still starving children in Europe?

86
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:28,385
- Try Southeast Asia, Ma.
- Right.

87
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:31,051
Robbie, Baby wants to send
her leftover pot roast...

88
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:34,255
to Southeast Asia,
so anything you don't finish, wrap up.

89
00:08:35,164 --> 00:08:37,792
Max, our Baby's gonna
change the world.

90
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:41,234
- And what are you gonna do, Missy?
- Lisa's gonna decorate it.

91
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:43,397
She already does.

92
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:49,310
Doc, I want you to meet someone.
My grandson Neil.

93
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:51,812
Goes to the Cornell School
of Hotel Management.

94
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:54,145
Baby's starting
Mount Holyoke in the fall.

95
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:56,846
Oh, great.

96
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:07,120
Are you going to major in English?

97
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:10,654
No. Economics of
underdeveloped countries.

98
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:14,134
- I'm going into the Peace Corps.
- After the final show...

99
00:09:14,203 --> 00:09:18,003
I'm going to Mississippi with
a couple of busboys, freedom ride.

100
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:39,986
This is our own Tito Suarez.

101
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:29,677
Mambo!
Yeah! Come on!

102
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:39,046
Who's that?

103
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:41,555
Oh, them.
They're the dance people.

104
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:44,593
They're here to keep
the guests happy.

105
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:11,413
They shouldn't show off with each other.
That's not gonna sell lessons.

106
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:30,889
- Hi, kids. Having fun?
- Yeah.

107
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:34,834
Actually, I've gotta excuse myself.
I'm in charge of the games tonight.

108
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:37,634
Would you like to help me
get things started?

109
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:39,401
Sure she would.

110
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:50,845
This'll only hurt for a minute.
You've got Blue Cross, right?

111
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:02,697
Was that good for you?

112
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:06,394
And for being such a good sport,
here you go!

113
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:14,870
I finally met a girl
exactly like my mother.

114
00:13:14,944 --> 00:13:18,004
Dresses like her, acts like her.
So I brought her home.

115
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,014
My father doesn't like her!

116
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:23,615
Go figure.

117
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:15,196
- Hi.
- How'd you get here?

118
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,863
- I was taking a walk.
- Go back.

119
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,930
Let me help you.
What's up there?

120
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:20,942
No guests allowed.
House rules.

121
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:25,470
Why don't you go back to the playhouse?
I saw you dancing with little boss man.

122
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:32,253
Can you keep a secret?

123
00:14:34,557 --> 00:14:37,117
Your parents would kill you.

124
00:14:37,192 --> 00:14:39,126
Max would kill me.

125
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:34,546
Where'd they learn to do that?

126
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:36,482
Where?

127
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:39,544
I don't know. Kids are doing it
in their basements back home.

128
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,790
Wanna try it?

129
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:45,593
Come on, Baby.

130
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,692
Can you imagine dancing like this
on the main floor...

131
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:28,168
home of the family fox-trot?

132
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,762
Max would close
the place down first.

133
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:05,203
That's my cousin, Johnny Castle.

134
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:08,306
He got me the job here.

135
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:29,820
- They look great together.
- Yeah.

136
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:32,332
You'd think they were
a couple, wouldn't you?

137
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:36,167
- Aren't they?
- No, not since we were kids.

138
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:15,944
Do you love me?

139
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:17,809
Do you love me?

140
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,400
Yo, cousin, what's she doing here?

141
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:43,731
She came with me.
She's with me.

142
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:45,637
I carried a watermelon.

143
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,740
I carried a watermelon?

144
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:29,643
Bend your knees. Down.

145
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:35,847
Watch. Watch my eyes.

146
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:38,417
Good.

147
00:19:42,564 --> 00:19:44,122
That's better.

148
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:50,938
Good. Now roll this way.

149
00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:54,468
Now watch.

150
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,148
Look.

151
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:18,695
Love man!

152
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:57,827
Ladies, join our hair-raising
wig show.

153
00:20:57,906 --> 00:20:59,874
Try your Sandra Dee,
Jackie Kennedy...

154
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:02,638
or Elizabeth Taylor-Cleopatra wig.

155
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:06,203
- I'll knock with three.
- Look at that cute fella.

156
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:08,545
Look at these hands.
They're golden hands.

157
00:21:11,253 --> 00:21:14,222
My God, it's Cleopatra!
I feel like such an ""asp"".

158
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:16,553
You look ten years younger.

159
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,526
At 10:.15, by the pool,
we have calisthenics.

160
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:22,893
Then on the west porch, we have
a symposium by Rabbi Maurice Sherman...

161
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:25,900
on the psychology
of insult comedians.

162
00:21:27,636 --> 00:21:30,628
So I say, ""Ask not what your waiter
can do for you...

163
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,197
but what you can do
for your waiter.""

164
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:36,244
If tips keep up, I'll have enough
for my Alfa Romeo.

165
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:39,477
That's my favorite car.

166
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,914
Ladies, you look very lovely.

167
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:48,855
Baby, would you cover for me tonight?
Tell Mom and Dad I went to lie down.

168
00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:50,721
Where are you going?

169
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:54,751
To the golf course. There's
a pretty view from the first tee.

170
00:21:57,966 --> 00:22:00,298
Good. Thanks.

171
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,606
So you were really a Rockette?

172
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:12,738
I think you're a wonderful dancer.

173
00:22:12,814 --> 00:22:16,215
Yeah? Well, my mother kicked me out
when I was 16.

174
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:19,947
I've been dancing ever since. It's the
only thing I ever wanted to do anyway.

175
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:23,257
I envy you.

176
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:51,142
- Aren't you dancing, Doc?
- We're waiting for a waltz.

177
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:56,714
Hi, Max. Aren't my dance lessons
starting to pay off?

178
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,284
You look great, Vivian!
Terrific!

179
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:07,434
That's Vivian Pressman,
one of the bungalow bunnies.

180
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:12,072
That's what we call the women
who stay here all week.

181
00:23:12,908 --> 00:23:15,843
The husbands only come up
on weekends.

182
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:19,278
Moe Pressman's a big card player.
He'll join our game.

183
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:23,680
- Moe coming up on Friday?
- Friday.

184
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,019
He's away a lot. I know.

185
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,315
It's a hardship.

186
00:23:36,431 --> 00:23:40,026
Where's Penny?
Everybody's been asking for her.

187
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,439
What do you mean, where's Penny?
She's taking a break.

188
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,032
As long as it's not
an all-night break.

189
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,705
Come on, doll. Let's take a walk.

190
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,560
I love to watch your hair
blowing in the breeze.

191
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,396
Maybe my parents
are looking for me.

192
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:15,231
Baby, don't worry.

193
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:19,069
If they think you're with me, they'll be
the happiest parents at Kellerman's.

194
00:24:21,276 --> 00:24:23,210
I have to say it.

195
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:26,270
- I'm known as the catch of the county.
- I'm sure you are.

196
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:29,476
Last week I took a girl away
from Jamie, the lifeguard.

197
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:34,716
And he said to her,
""What does he have that I don't have?""

198
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:38,088
And she said, ""Two hotels.""

199
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:41,254
Robbie.

200
00:24:42,164 --> 00:24:44,189
I don't hear an apology.

201
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:49,465
Go back to Mommy and Daddy and listen.
Maybe you'll hear one in your dreams.

202
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,438
I'm sorry you had
to see that, Baby.

203
00:24:55,343 --> 00:24:57,834
Sometimes in this world...

204
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,438
you see things
you don't wanna see.

205
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,954
You hungry?

206
00:25:07,822 --> 00:25:09,449
Come on.

207
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:19,466
So, Baby, what do you want?
You can have anything you want.

208
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:23,263
A brownie, some milk...

209
00:25:23,338 --> 00:25:26,865
Ieftover rice pudding,
beets...

210
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,637
cabbage roll...

211
00:25:32,847 --> 00:25:35,179
fruit salad, sweet gherkins?

212
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:39,346
Neil, look, I'm sorry.
I better go check on Lisa.

213
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:41,150
Yeah.

214
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:13,888
- Why's she here?
- In case Neil comes back.

215
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:16,048
Penny just doesn't think.

216
00:26:16,124 --> 00:26:19,059
She wouldn't do anything
stupid, would she?

217
00:26:19,928 --> 00:26:23,625
So, what's wrong?
What's the matter with her?

218
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,191
- She's knocked up, Baby.
- Billy!

219
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,863
- What's he gonna do about it?
- ""What's he gonna do about it?""

220
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:35,166
It's mine, right?

221
00:26:35,243 --> 00:26:37,939
- Right away you think it's mine.
- But I thought...

222
00:26:55,563 --> 00:26:58,225
It's okay. Johnny's here.

223
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:05,239
I'm never gonna let anything
happen to you.

224
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:11,445
We got to go.

225
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:15,914
Just hold on. Just hold on.

226
00:27:15,984 --> 00:27:18,578
Good girl. Good girl.

227
00:27:23,191 --> 00:27:26,183
What do you think you're doing?
You're in trouble, you talk to me.

228
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:28,695
I'll take care of it.

229
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:32,290
You should've come to me
in the first place.

230
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:35,734
Forget it, Johnny. I'm not taking
what's left of your salary.

231
00:27:35,804 --> 00:27:39,763
- Penny, that's my business.
- Besides, it wouldn't be enough.

232
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,018
Oh, God, it's hopeless!

233
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,248
Don't say that.

234
00:27:54,322 --> 00:27:57,291
There's gotta be a way
to work it out.

235
00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:03,295
Baby? Is that your name?

236
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:05,928
You know what, Baby?

237
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:09,435
You don't know shit
about my problems.

238
00:28:10,638 --> 00:28:12,629
I told her.

239
00:28:12,707 --> 00:28:18,168
Jesus! She's gonna tell her management
boyfriend and then we'll all get fired.

240
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:22,546
Why not skywrite it? ""Penny got
knocked up by Robbie, the creep.""

241
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:25,245
- Look--
- No, Baby.

242
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:29,321
One of the counselors
knows a doctor, a real M.D....

243
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:32,383
just traveling through New Paltz
one day next week.

244
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,258
We can get an appointment,
but it costs $250.

245
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,959
But if it's Robbie, there's no problem.
I know he has the money.

246
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:41,467
- I'm sure if you tell him--
- He knows.

247
00:28:49,043 --> 00:28:53,104
Go back to your playpen, Baby.

248
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:03,091
- Why should you tell me what's right?
- You can't just leave her.

249
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:06,686
- Why should you tell me what's right?
- You can't just leave her.

250
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:10,253
I didn't blow a summer hauling bagels
just to bail out some chick...

251
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,629
who probably slept
with every guy here.

252
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,691
A little precision, please.

253
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:20,699
Some people count
and some people don't.

254
00:29:22,577 --> 00:29:23,509
Read it.

255
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:29,305
I think you'll enjoy it. But return it.
I have notes in there.

256
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:34,850
You make me sick.
Stay away from me.

257
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:39,189
Stay away from my sister
or I'll have you fired.

258
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:55,476
What am I doing wrong?

259
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,478
You're lining it up
a little wrong, Marge.

260
00:30:00,148 --> 00:30:02,878
If your mother ever leaves me,
it'll be for Arnold Palmer.

261
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:05,749
- Daddy, someone's in trouble.
- Besides your mother?

262
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,913
You're overcorrecting, Marge.

263
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,426
You always told me if someone
was in trouble, I should help.

264
00:30:12,494 --> 00:30:14,428
Could you lend me $250?

265
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,160
Are you all right?
Are you in trouble?

266
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,202
No, it's not me.
Could you loan it to me?

267
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:23,897
That's a lot of money.
What's it for?

268
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:26,065
Baby, stand up straight.

269
00:30:26,941 --> 00:30:29,034
I can't tell you.

270
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:32,341
It's hard for me to say that to you,
but I can't.

271
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,177
You always said you could
tell me anything.

272
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,616
I can't tell you this.

273
00:30:39,721 --> 00:30:42,121
It's not illegal, is it?

274
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,450
No, Daddy.

275
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:51,863
That was a stupid thing to ask.
Forgive me.

276
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:55,460
I'll have it for you before dinner.

277
00:30:55,537 --> 00:30:58,131
- Is everything all right?
- Fine.

278
00:30:58,206 --> 00:31:00,140
Thanks, Daddy.

279
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:02,198
Here's the money.

280
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:07,974
- You mean Robbie?
- No. You were right about him?

281
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:11,534
- Then where'd you get it?
- You said you needed it.

282
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:16,178
- Is this kid for real?
- Takes a real saint to ask Daddy.

283
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:23,855
Thanks, Baby, but I can't use it.

284
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:32,064
What? What's the matter with you?
You should take the money.

285
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:35,534
I can only get her an appointment
for Thursday.

286
00:32:35,603 --> 00:32:37,901
They do their act
at the Sheldrake Thursday.

287
00:32:37,972 --> 00:32:41,806
If they cancel, they lose this
season's salary and next year's gig.

288
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,468
What's the Sheldrake?

289
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:47,537
It's another hotel
where they do their mambo act.

290
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,311
Can't someone else fill in?

291
00:32:51,786 --> 00:32:54,254
No, ""Miss Fix-it.""
Somebody else can't.

292
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:57,416
Maria has to work all day.
She can't learn the routines.

293
00:32:57,492 --> 00:33:00,586
And Janet has to fill in for Penny.
Everybody works here.

294
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,263
You wanna do it?
Take time out from ""Simon Says""?

295
00:33:06,768 --> 00:33:08,702
It's not a bad idea.

296
00:33:09,671 --> 00:33:11,104
It was a 5oke.

297
00:33:12,206 --> 00:33:15,664
- She can move.
- It's the dumbest idea I ever heard of.

298
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,177
- I can't even do the merengue.
- See?

299
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,806
You're a strong partner.
You can lead anybody.

300
00:33:20,882 --> 00:33:24,579
She can't even do the merengue.
She cannot do it.

301
00:33:29,957 --> 00:33:32,255
- No!
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.

302
00:33:32,326 --> 00:33:34,851
You don't step on the one.

303
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:38,695
You gotta start on the two.
Find the two. Understand?

304
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:43,260
-I never did any of these dances before.
-It's one, two, three, four.

305
00:33:43,337 --> 00:33:47,068
When the music starts, you don't
dance until the two. Got it?

306
00:33:47,141 --> 00:33:49,166
Relax, relax.

307
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:50,972
Breathe.

308
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:53,305
Frame.

309
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:54,973
Nope.

310
00:34:01,723 --> 00:34:02,985
Again.

311
00:34:03,057 --> 00:34:05,048
Ow.

312
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,152
Two, three, four.
Two, three, four.

313
00:34:08,229 --> 00:34:10,891
Don't lean back. Lifting up.

314
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,331
Two, three, four.
Shoulders down.

315
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,632
Again. Concentrate. And...

316
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:05,317
Don't put your heel down.

317
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,213
- Don't put your heel down.
- I didn't--

318
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:10,689
Stay on the toe.
Just listen to me.

319
00:35:10,758 --> 00:35:13,090
The steps aren't enough.

320
00:35:13,161 --> 00:35:15,220
Feel the music.

321
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:37,652
It's not on the one.
It's not the mambo.

322
00:35:37,652 --> 00:35:40,280
It's not on the one.
It's not the mambo.

323
00:35:40,354 --> 00:35:43,414
It's a feeling, a heartbeat.

324
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,593
Don't try so hard.

325
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:58,905
Close your eyes.

326
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:08,147
Two, three, four.
Two, three, four.

327
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:12,777
Breathe.

328
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:28,391
Head up.
Lock your frame. Lock it.

329
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:30,403
Look, spaghetti arm.

330
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,537
This is my dance space.
This is your dance space.

331
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:38,101
I don't go into yours. You don't
go into mine. You gotta hold the frame.

332
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:39,976
Again.

333
00:36:40,047 --> 00:36:41,639
Frame.

334
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:36,190
Back. Easy.

335
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,181
Back. Easy.

336
00:39:39,827 --> 00:39:43,558
And turn, turn. Down.
And lift. You'll learn that later.

337
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,531
And come on.

338
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,567
Down. Twist.

339
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,262
And the bow.

340
00:39:49,336 --> 00:39:52,305
- Sorry. Sorry.
- You trying to kill me?

341
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:56,639
You gotta concentrate!
Is that your idea of fun?

342
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,974
As a matter of fact it is.

343
00:39:59,046 --> 00:40:02,914
We do the show in two days, you won't
show me lifts, I'm not sure of turns.

344
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:06,612
I'm doing all this to save your ass,
but I'd rather drop you on it!

345
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:09,920
Let's leave.

346
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,359
Shit!

347
00:40:20,634 --> 00:40:23,034
I locked the keys in the car!

348
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:47,890
You're getting wet, right?

349
00:41:00,508 --> 00:41:02,476
- You're wild.
- What?

350
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,738
You're wild!

351
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:38,244
Now, the most important thing
to remember in lifts is balance.

352
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,977
Whoa! Whoa!

353
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:48,748
I got it now.

354
00:41:48,822 --> 00:41:51,757
So where'd you learn
to be a dancer?

355
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,860
Well, this guy came into
this luncheonette one day and...

356
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,128
we were all sitting around
doing nothing.

357
00:42:00,201 --> 00:42:03,762
And he said that Arthur Murray
was giving a test for instructors.

358
00:42:03,837 --> 00:42:06,135
So, if you passed...

359
00:42:10,344 --> 00:42:15,145
they teach you different dances, show
you how to break them down, teach them.

360
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:20,150
What?

361
00:42:28,996 --> 00:42:30,759
Good.

362
00:42:31,532 --> 00:42:35,764
Don't look down.
Look here. Good.

363
00:42:35,836 --> 00:42:37,497
And...

364
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,705
Now, bend your knees
and go up. Go, go.

365
00:43:24,652 --> 00:43:28,748
Good try. Now, you'll hurt me
if you don't trust me, all right?

366
00:43:28,822 --> 00:43:30,756
Now, go, go. Go.

367
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,558
Good. Now, I'm gonna go up.

368
00:43:42,803 --> 00:43:46,102
You know, the best place
to practice lifts is in the water.

369
00:43:46,173 --> 00:43:48,664
Just bend your knees.
And... go.

370
00:43:49,576 --> 00:43:51,134
Good.

371
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,803
Good. Good.

372
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,973
Now hold the position. Hold it.

373
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,244
Good. Don't break! Don't break!

374
00:44:10,597 --> 00:44:12,531
Let's do it again.

375
00:44:15,336 --> 00:44:19,170
All right. One, two, three.

376
00:44:20,474 --> 00:44:22,271
Oh, sorry.

377
00:44:23,477 --> 00:44:25,775
Good. Keep-- No, don't.

378
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,290
It's not too bad.

379
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:48,601
- One more time.
- Okay. Over my head. Go.

380
00:44:50,337 --> 00:44:50,404
I can't believe it's tonight.

381
00:44:50,404 --> 00:44:52,702
I can't believe it's tonight.

382
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,970
Sheldrake's 20 minutes away.
We'll change in the car.

383
00:44:58,245 --> 00:45:01,703
Mrs. Schumacher.
Hey, wait, we'll help you.

384
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:06,481
Such junk. Such junk.

385
00:45:08,021 --> 00:45:12,981
Benny Bernstein's Dancing School,
that's where I went.

386
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,790
George Burns was a teacher.

387
00:45:17,164 --> 00:45:19,564
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

388
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:24,371
I'll just keep my shoulders down,
my head up...

389
00:45:24,371 --> 00:45:27,135
I'll just keep my shoulders down,
my head up...

390
00:45:27,207 --> 00:45:30,335
my frame locked,
stay on my toes...

391
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:32,436
What if I forget the steps?

392
00:45:32,513 --> 00:45:36,040
Pull up, watch the frame.
And remember, let him lead you.

393
00:45:36,116 --> 00:45:40,450
I'm afraid I'm gonna forget to spike,
get dizzy and fall on my face.

394
00:45:40,521 --> 00:45:45,424
No. Don't look at my feet,
keep my head up, my eyes open...

395
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:49,485
tension in my arms, my frame locked,
seat pulled up...

396
00:45:49,563 --> 00:45:51,497
Thanks, Baby.

397
00:45:54,034 --> 00:45:57,231
I just want you to know
that I don't sleep around...

398
00:45:57,304 --> 00:46:00,364
whatever Robbie might have told you.

399
00:46:00,441 --> 00:46:03,205
And I thought that he loved me.

400
00:46:04,077 --> 00:46:06,375
I thought it was something special.

401
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:10,381
Anyway, I just wanted you
to know that.

402
00:46:14,421 --> 00:46:16,719
So, how does it look?

403
00:46:24,465 --> 00:46:26,057
I'm scared.

404
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:30,901
I'm so scared, Baby.

405
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,806
Don't worry.

406
00:46:34,441 --> 00:46:36,375
You'll be fine.

407
00:46:41,482 --> 00:46:45,475
Bingo! Bingo! Bingo! That's right.
It's Thursday night at Kellerman's.

408
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,486
That's bingo night.

409
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:51,285
- Hey, how about a dance later?
- Could be. Who knows?

410
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:54,759
- Lisa, you have to do something for me.
- I don't have to.

411
00:46:54,828 --> 00:46:59,162
Just tell Mom and Dad I have a headache
and I'm in bed, okay?

412
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,259
Bye.

413
00:47:04,938 --> 00:47:05,005
The Sheldrake Hotel is proud to present
Johnny Castle and partner...

414
00:47:05,005 --> 00:47:09,408
The Sheldrake Hotel is proud to present
Johnny Castle and partner...

415
00:47:09,476 --> 00:47:11,774
in ""Mambo Magic.""

416
00:47:15,482 --> 00:47:16,949
Relax.

417
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:51,845
Now spot a lead.

418
00:48:20,881 --> 00:48:22,815
Wrong way!

419
00:48:31,058 --> 00:48:32,992
Over here.

420
00:48:40,567 --> 00:48:42,364
Ready for the lift?

421
00:48:44,771 --> 00:48:46,136
Come on.

422
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,947
Keep going. Keep going.

423
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:41,583
...because wherever you are now,
I want you to look at the sky.

424
00:49:41,662 --> 00:49:45,928
Look at those stars.
What a show. Here are The Drifters.

425
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,934
You did good. You worked hard.

426
00:49:49,002 --> 00:49:51,596
I saw that old couple from Kellerman's
and I thought that was it.

427
00:49:51,672 --> 00:49:53,663
Me too. Me too.

428
00:49:55,275 --> 00:49:58,005
You know, by the second turn
you really had it.

429
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,605
- But I didn't do the lift.
- You did real good.

430
00:51:03,744 --> 00:51:05,336
Thanks.

431
00:51:08,582 --> 00:51:10,174
Johnny!

432
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,014
Come on. It's Penny.

433
00:51:14,554 --> 00:51:17,421
- She wouldn't go until you returned.
- Did you call an ambulance?

434
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,187
She said the hospital would call
the police. She made me promise.

435
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:23,093
He didn't use no ether, nothing.

436
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:28,328
- I thought you said he was a real M.D.?
- He had a dirty knife and a table.

437
00:51:28,401 --> 00:51:30,699
I could hear her screaming
in the hallway.

438
00:51:30,771 --> 00:51:33,706
I swear to God,
I tried to get in.

439
00:51:35,809 --> 00:51:38,607
It's all right. Johnny's here.

440
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,353
What? What is it, Baby?

441
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,724
- Is it Lisa?
- No.

442
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:16,741
Excuse me. Excuse me!
Everybody clear out, please.

443
00:52:27,327 --> 00:52:30,524
Yes, I know that hurts.
We're gonna take care of that.

444
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,900
- Who's responsible for this girl?
- I am.

445
00:52:37,971 --> 00:52:40,303
Please, is she--

446
00:52:57,991 --> 00:52:59,925
Doc, thanks a lot.

447
00:52:59,993 --> 00:53:03,292
I don't know how to thank you.

448
00:53:13,306 --> 00:53:16,798
- Was that what my money paid for?
- I'm sorry. I never meant to lie.

449
00:53:16,877 --> 00:53:20,472
You're not the person I thought
you were. I'm not sure who you are.

450
00:53:20,547 --> 00:53:22,947
I don't want you to have anything
to do with those people.

451
00:53:23,016 --> 00:53:27,043
Nothing! You're to have nothing
to do with them ever again!

452
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,715
I won't tell your mother about this.
Right now I'm going to bed.

453
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:34,157
And take that stuff off your face
before your mother sees you!

454
00:53:38,398 --> 00:53:40,992
Is everything all right, Jake?

455
00:53:41,067 --> 00:53:44,503
It's all right, Marjorie.
Go back to sleep.

456
00:54:04,257 --> 00:54:06,191
Can I come in?

457
00:54:18,471 --> 00:54:22,339
I got a-- I guess it's not a great room.
You probably got a great room.

458
00:54:22,409 --> 00:54:24,877
No. It's a great room!

459
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,288
Leave it on.

460
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:42,423
I'm sorry about the way
my father treated you.

461
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,927
No. Your father was great.

462
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,663
He was great.
The way he took care of Penny.

463
00:54:50,737 --> 00:54:53,865
I mean the way he was with you.

464
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,408
It's really me it has to do with.

465
00:54:58,745 --> 00:55:01,737
Johnny, I came here
because my father--

466
00:55:01,815 --> 00:55:05,478
No. The way he saved her--
I could never do anything like that.

467
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:09,511
That was something. People treat me
like I'm nothing because I am nothing.

468
00:55:10,357 --> 00:55:13,417
That's not true!
You're everything!

469
00:55:15,195 --> 00:55:18,392
You don't understand the way it is
for somebody like me.

470
00:55:18,465 --> 00:55:20,660
Last month I'm eating candy
to stay alive.

471
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,726
This month, women are stuffing
diamonds in my pockets.

472
00:55:23,803 --> 00:55:26,033
I'm balancing on shit
and I can be down there again.

473
00:55:26,106 --> 00:55:29,701
No, it's not the way it is!
It doesn't have to be that way!

474
00:55:32,712 --> 00:55:35,704
I've never known anyone like you.
You think you can make the world better.

475
00:55:35,782 --> 00:55:37,875
Somebody's lost, you find them.
Somebody's bleeding--

476
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:41,819
I go get my daddy.
That's really brave, like you said.

477
00:55:41,888 --> 00:55:44,721
That took a lot of guts
to go to him!

478
00:55:44,791 --> 00:55:46,884
You are not scared of anything.

479
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,124
I'm scared of everything!
I'm scared of what I saw.

480
00:55:51,197 --> 00:55:54,826
I'm scared of what I did,
who I am.

481
00:55:54,901 --> 00:56:00,237
I'm scared of walking out of here and
never feeling for the rest of my life...

482
00:56:00,306 --> 00:56:02,536
the way I feel
when I'm with you!

483
00:56:24,264 --> 00:56:26,198
Dance with me.

484
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,098
What, here?

485
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:31,831
Here.

486
00:59:31,884 --> 00:59:35,081
Singers, dancers, actors,
this is your lucky day!

487
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:38,590
Auditions for the annual Kellerman
end-of-the-season talent show...

488
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,683
beginning in the playhouse.

489
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,333
- Everyone gonna be in the show?
- We're leaving tomorrow.

490
00:59:50,403 --> 00:59:52,564
Miss the weekend traffic.

491
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:54,504
But we're paid up 'til Sunday.

492
00:59:54,574 --> 00:59:57,566
- And miss the show?
- I said we're leaving tomorrow.

493
00:59:57,644 --> 01:00:00,636
- I was going to sing in the show.
- It's the big event.

494
01:00:00,713 --> 01:00:03,079
People bring their own arrangements.
You don't want to miss it.

495
01:00:03,149 --> 01:00:05,174
Baby, I need you for props.

496
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,849
Why would you want to leave early?

497
01:00:16,829 --> 01:00:19,662
It was just an idea.
We can stay if you want to.

498
01:00:23,403 --> 01:00:26,930
- So, what were you planning to sing?
- ""l Feel Pretty.""

499
01:00:27,006 --> 01:00:29,998
Or ""What Do the Simple Folk Do?""

500
01:00:30,076 --> 01:00:33,842
Or ""l Feel Pretty.""
What do you think, Daddy?

501
01:00:45,858 --> 01:00:47,291
You look much better.

502
01:00:49,996 --> 01:00:53,557
You just missed your father.
He's such a wonderful man.

503
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:57,961
I'm sorry. I didn't realize--

504
01:00:58,037 --> 01:01:00,369
You couldn't have. It's okay.

505
01:01:12,385 --> 01:01:15,183
- So, how you doin'?
- I'm okay.

506
01:01:16,789 --> 01:01:19,223
Dr. Houseman says
I'm going to be fine.

507
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:24,360
- I can still have children.
- Oh, Penny, that's really great.

508
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,697
So, how did it go last night?

509
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,737
Good.

510
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:37,533
Fine. I didn't do the lifts,
but it was good.

511
01:01:48,254 --> 01:01:52,953
Well, I guess I gonna go.

512
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,755
See ya.

513
01:02:04,837 --> 01:02:07,169
- So, he says you're going to be fine?
- What are you doing?

514
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:10,698
- I'll tell Max your grandmother died.
- How many times have you told me...

515
01:02:10,777 --> 01:02:13,541
never get mixed-up with them?

516
01:02:13,613 --> 01:02:15,547
I know what I'm doing.

517
01:02:16,616 --> 01:02:20,382
You listen to me.
You've got to stop it now.

518
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:39,566
Look, I gotta run.
I got a lesson with the Kramers.

519
01:02:39,639 --> 01:02:42,005
They'll kill each other
if I'm not there.

520
01:02:42,074 --> 01:02:44,508
Well, sure. You've gotta go.

521
01:02:47,313 --> 01:02:48,746
I'll see ya.

522
01:03:08,267 --> 01:03:11,168
It's rainy day game time.
Pin the tail on the guest.

523
01:03:11,237 --> 01:03:13,671
Win ten boxes of Kleenex
or a billy goat!

524
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:18,232
God, I am so sick of this rain.

525
01:03:18,311 --> 01:03:21,007
Remind me not to take my honeymoon
at Niagara Falls.

526
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,208
So, you go to Acapulco.
It'll be fine.

527
01:03:24,283 --> 01:03:27,946
Where is my beige
iridescent lipstick?

528
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:30,181
I know I put it in this drawer.

529
01:03:30,256 --> 01:03:32,486
Baby, where are you going
in this weather?

530
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:35,152
Uh, they're having charades
in the west lobby.

531
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:38,163
Quite the little joiner,
aren't we?

532
01:03:52,945 --> 01:03:56,312
- Have you had many women?
- What?

533
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:00,916
Baby, come on.

534
01:04:00,987 --> 01:04:02,921
Tell me. I want to know.

535
01:04:14,734 --> 01:04:16,861
You gotta understand
what it's like.

536
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:19,370
You come from the streets
and suddenly you're up here.

537
01:04:19,438 --> 01:04:23,340
Women are throwing themselves
at you and they smell so good.

538
01:04:23,409 --> 01:04:25,502
They really take care
of themselves.

539
01:04:25,578 --> 01:04:28,012
I never knew women
could be like that.

540
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:31,345
They're so goddamn rich you think
they must know about everything.

541
01:04:31,417 --> 01:04:34,113
They're slippin' their room keys
in my hand two and three times a day--

542
01:04:34,186 --> 01:04:38,384
different women--
so, I think I'm scorin' big, right?

543
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:42,894
You think, ""They wouldn't be doing this
if they didn't care about me, right?""

544
01:04:44,096 --> 01:04:47,065
That's all right. I understand.
You were just using them, that's all.

545
01:04:49,001 --> 01:04:50,468
No, that's not it.

546
01:04:51,404 --> 01:04:53,702
That's the thing.
It wasn't like that.

547
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:57,901
They were using me.

548
01:05:25,471 --> 01:05:27,405
What's your real name, Baby?

549
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:33,573
Frances, for the first woman
in the Cabinet.

550
01:05:35,781 --> 01:05:39,148
Frances.
That's a real grownup name.

551
01:05:52,331 --> 01:05:54,765
I've decided to go
all the way with Robbie.

552
01:05:57,336 --> 01:06:01,033
No, not with someone like him.

553
01:06:01,107 --> 01:06:05,476
Do you think if we came back for a
ten-year anniversary, it would be free?

554
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:09,071
It's just wrong this way.
It should be with someone--

555
01:06:09,148 --> 01:06:13,710
With someone that
you sort of love.

556
01:06:13,786 --> 01:06:18,018
Come on.
You don't care about me.

557
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:21,116
You wouldn't care if I humped
the entire army...

558
01:06:21,193 --> 01:06:24,356
as long as we were on the right side
of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

559
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:29,265
What you care about is that
you're not Daddy's girl anymore.

560
01:06:29,335 --> 01:06:31,769
He listens when I talk now.

561
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:34,338
You hate that.

562
01:06:51,524 --> 01:06:54,288
Two, three, cha-cha-cha.

563
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:57,227
My frame.
Where's my pleasing arc?

564
01:06:57,296 --> 01:07:00,857
Spaghetti arms! Would you
give me some tension, please?

565
01:07:02,735 --> 01:07:06,102
You're invading my dance space.
This is my dance space.

566
01:07:06,172 --> 01:07:08,572
That's yours. Let's cha-cha.

567
01:07:14,747 --> 01:07:17,409
Don't look down.
Look right here.

568
01:07:26,325 --> 01:07:31,092
- How you call your lover boy?
- Come here, lover boy.

569
01:07:31,163 --> 01:07:34,724
- And if he doesn't answer?
- Oh, lover boy.

570
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,167
- And if still doesn't answer?
- I simply say...

571
01:07:38,237 --> 01:07:41,001
Baby

572
01:07:41,073 --> 01:07:43,906
O-Oh, baby

573
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:47,810
My sweet baby

574
01:07:48,881 --> 01:07:50,815
You're the one

575
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:07,655
Takin' dance lessons?

576
01:08:08,734 --> 01:08:10,668
I could teach ya, kid.

577
01:08:15,374 --> 01:08:18,366
My grandfather put me in charge
of the final show.

578
01:08:18,444 --> 01:08:20,742
I want to talk to you
about the last dance.

579
01:08:20,813 --> 01:08:23,907
I'd like to shake things up a bit.

580
01:08:23,983 --> 01:08:26,611
You know, move with the times.

581
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:28,710
I've got a lot of ideas.

582
01:08:28,788 --> 01:08:30,847
I've been working
with the staff kids...

583
01:08:30,923 --> 01:08:34,450
on a cross between a Cuban rhythm
and soul dancing.

584
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,325
Whoa, boy.

585
01:08:37,396 --> 01:08:39,660
Way over your head here.

586
01:08:39,732 --> 01:08:43,725
You always do the mambo, huh?

587
01:08:43,803 --> 01:08:47,000
Why not dance this year's
final dance...

588
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,906
to the pachenga?

589
01:08:52,111 --> 01:08:53,237
Right.

590
01:08:55,414 --> 01:08:59,145
Well, you're free to do the same,
tired number as last year if you want...

591
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:02,153
but next year we'll find
another dance person...

592
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,621
- who'll only be too happy--
- Sure, Neil. No problem.

593
01:09:06,826 --> 01:09:08,987
We'll end the season
with the pachenga.

594
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:10,528
Great idea.

595
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:21,438
Sometimes he's hard to talk to,
but the ladies seem to like him.

596
01:09:21,507 --> 01:09:24,499
See that he gives you the full half-hour
you're paying him for, kid.

597
01:09:33,385 --> 01:09:36,445
That little wimp. He wouldn't know a
new idea if it hit him in the pachenga.

598
01:09:36,522 --> 01:09:38,820
I could have told him
some new ideas.

599
01:09:38,891 --> 01:09:40,882
Why did you let him
talk to you that way?

600
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,451
- What, fight the boss man?
- You tell him your ideas.

601
01:09:43,529 --> 01:09:46,327
- He's a person like everyone else.
- Look, I know these people.

602
01:09:46,398 --> 01:09:49,060
They are rich and they're mean.
They won't listen to me.

603
01:09:49,134 --> 01:09:51,568
Why not fight harder?
Make them listen.

604
01:09:51,637 --> 01:09:54,538
Because I need this goddamned job
lined up for next summer.

605
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,701
My dad calls me today.

606
01:09:57,776 --> 01:10:00,404
""Good news,"" he says. ""Uncle Paul
can finally get you in the union.""

607
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:01,741
What union?

608
01:10:02,915 --> 01:10:06,851
The House Painters and Plasterers
Local Number 179 at your service.

609
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,520
I've been thinking a lot
about the Domino Theory.

610
01:10:17,596 --> 01:10:19,928
Now, when Viet Nam falls,
is China Next?

611
01:10:22,768 --> 01:10:24,702
I don't think they saw us.

612
01:10:35,881 --> 01:10:37,314
Fight harder, huh?

613
01:10:38,384 --> 01:10:42,115
I don't see you fightin' so hard,
tellin' Daddy I'm your guy.

614
01:10:42,187 --> 01:10:44,382
I will. With my father,
it's complicated.

615
01:10:44,456 --> 01:10:46,890
- I will tell him.
- I don't believe you, Baby.

616
01:10:50,562 --> 01:10:51,995
I don't think...

617
01:10:53,532 --> 01:10:56,296
that you ever had
any intention of telling him.

618
01:10:57,369 --> 01:10:58,495
Ever.

619
01:11:09,548 --> 01:11:09,581
Well, Cousin, it's almost over.
Labor Day weekend is here.

620
01:11:09,581 --> 01:11:12,379
Well, Cousin, it's almost over.
Labor Day weekend is here.

621
01:11:12,451 --> 01:11:16,148
Soon it's back to the old books and
back to work. What a terrible thought!

622
01:11:25,931 --> 01:11:27,865
Have you seen Johnny?

623
01:11:43,682 --> 01:11:44,944
I'm sorry.

624
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:51,322
Looks like I picked
the wrong sister.

625
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:54,188
That's okay, Baby.
I went slummin' too.

626
01:12:12,044 --> 01:12:13,705
Hit me.

627
01:12:20,819 --> 01:12:22,753
Get out of here.
You're not worth it.

628
01:13:20,946 --> 01:13:23,141
Win big, Moe.

629
01:13:23,215 --> 01:13:24,477
As always.

630
01:13:42,034 --> 01:13:45,868
This is our last night together, lover.
I've got something worked out for us.

631
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:10,825
Excuse me, sir.
The pirate number's next.

632
01:14:10,896 --> 01:14:13,194
Oh, thanks.
Hey, kid.

633
01:14:13,265 --> 01:14:15,995
I've been playing cards all weekend
and I've got an all-night game tonight.

634
01:14:16,068 --> 01:14:19,595
Why don't you give my wife
some extra dance lessons?

635
01:14:28,614 --> 01:14:30,548
I'm sorry, Mr. Pressman...

636
01:14:30,616 --> 01:14:33,141
but I'm booked up for
the whole weekend with the show.

637
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:35,413
I won't have time
for anything else.

638
01:14:35,487 --> 01:14:38,684
I don't think it'd be fair
to take the money.

639
01:15:03,448 --> 01:15:06,281
I've decided tonight's the night
with Robbie.

640
01:15:06,351 --> 01:15:08,512
He doesn't even know yet.

641
01:15:44,189 --> 01:15:45,451
It's me.

642
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:51,960
Holy shit!

643
01:16:13,018 --> 01:16:15,111
You wanna hear somethin' crazy?

644
01:16:19,458 --> 01:16:20,891
Last night l--

645
01:16:22,094 --> 01:16:26,360
I dreamt we were walking along
and we met your father.

646
01:16:26,431 --> 01:16:29,093
He said, ""Come on,""
and he put his arm around me.

647
01:16:30,802 --> 01:16:32,895
Just like he did with Robbie.

648
01:17:20,185 --> 01:17:25,452
You know how you feel when you see a
patient and you think he's all right...

649
01:17:25,524 --> 01:17:28,459
then you look at the X rays
and it's nothing like you thought?

650
01:17:28,527 --> 01:17:29,789
What happened?

651
01:17:29,861 --> 01:17:33,297
It's exactly what it's like when you
find out one of your staff's a thief.

652
01:17:33,365 --> 01:17:37,028
Moe Pressman's wallet was stolen
when he was playing pinochle last night.

653
01:17:37,102 --> 01:17:40,128
It was in his jacket hanging
on the back of his chair.

654
01:17:40,205 --> 01:17:44,437
He had it at 1:30 and when he
checked again at quarter of 4::00...

655
01:17:44,509 --> 01:17:46,909
it was missing.

656
01:17:46,978 --> 01:17:51,506
Vivian thinks she remembers
this dance kid Johnny...

657
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:52,845
walking by.

658
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:57,787
So we ask him,
""You have an alibi for last night?""

659
01:17:57,856 --> 01:18:00,086
He says he was alone
in his room reading.

660
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:03,894
There are no books
in Johnny's room!

661
01:18:05,864 --> 01:18:07,923
There's been a mistake.
I know Johnny didn't do it.

662
01:18:07,999 --> 01:18:10,467
There's been similar thefts at the
Sheldrake. It's happened here before.

663
01:18:10,535 --> 01:18:12,901
- Three other wallets.
- I know he didn't do it.

664
01:18:12,971 --> 01:18:15,064
Stay out of it, Baby.

665
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:18,974
Wait. Don't put those
tables together. Come on.

666
01:18:21,246 --> 01:18:25,307
Daddy, I need your help.
I know Johnny didn't take Moe's wallet.

667
01:18:25,384 --> 01:18:27,750
- Oh? How do you know?
- I can't tell you.

668
01:18:27,819 --> 01:18:32,620
- Just please trust me, Daddy.
- I'm sorry, Baby. I can't.

669
01:18:32,691 --> 01:18:34,784
This Danish is pure protein.

670
01:18:37,629 --> 01:18:41,326
Maybe Johnny didn't do it.
Anyone could've taken it.

671
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,334
Maybe it was, uh--

672
01:18:43,402 --> 01:18:46,269
It could've been that little,
old couple, the Schumachers.

673
01:18:46,338 --> 01:18:49,569
- I saw her with a couple of wallets.
- Sylvia and Sidney?

674
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:52,701
Baby, you don't go around
accusing innocent people.

675
01:18:52,778 --> 01:18:57,238
I even saw them at the Sheldrake. You
said something was stolen from there.

676
01:18:57,315 --> 01:19:00,910
I got an eyewitness
and the kid has no alibi.

677
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:04,888
Come on, Neil. You'll learn
what it's like to fire an employee.

678
01:19:06,124 --> 01:19:09,616
Wait a minute. I know Johnny
didn't take the wallet.

679
01:19:09,694 --> 01:19:12,925
I know because he was
in his room all night.

680
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:17,458
And the reason I know
is because I was with him.

681
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,794
I told you I was
telling the truth.

682
01:19:48,667 --> 01:19:50,601
I'm sorry I lied to you.

683
01:19:53,505 --> 01:19:55,439
But you lied too.

684
01:19:57,676 --> 01:20:01,203
You told me everyone was alike
and deserved a fair break.

685
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:03,372
But you meant everyone
who is like you.

686
01:20:06,151 --> 01:20:09,382
You told me you wanted me to change
the world, to make it better.

687
01:20:10,455 --> 01:20:13,083
But you meant by becoming
a lawyer or an economist...

688
01:20:13,158 --> 01:20:15,319
and marrying someone
from Harvard.

689
01:20:17,996 --> 01:20:20,521
I'm not proud of myself.

690
01:20:20,599 --> 01:20:24,126
But I'm in this family too. You can't
keep giving me the silent treatment.

691
01:20:27,672 --> 01:20:30,470
There are a lot of things about me
that aren't what you thought.

692
01:20:31,543 --> 01:20:34,478
But if you love me, you have to love
all the things about me.

693
01:20:37,148 --> 01:20:39,082
And I love you.

694
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:43,746
I'm sorry I let you down.
I'm so sorry, Daddy.

695
01:20:44,623 --> 01:20:46,887
But you let me down too.

696
01:21:17,155 --> 01:21:19,385
I have been lookin'
for you all over.

697
01:21:20,358 --> 01:21:22,223
They found the Schumachers.

698
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:24,626
Fingerprinted their water glasses.

699
01:21:24,696 --> 01:21:27,563
Found out they were wanted
in Arizona and in Florida...

700
01:21:27,632 --> 01:21:30,032
and they made a fortune
here this summer.

701
01:21:30,101 --> 01:21:32,035
So then it's all right.

702
01:21:33,171 --> 01:21:35,196
I knew it would work out.

703
01:21:35,273 --> 01:21:37,537
- I knew they'd have to apologize.
- I'm out, Baby.

704
01:21:42,814 --> 01:21:44,748
They fired you anyway
because of me.

705
01:21:46,384 --> 01:21:49,751
And if I leave quietly,
I'll get my summer bonus.

706
01:21:52,724 --> 01:21:54,658
So I did it for nothing.

707
01:21:54,726 --> 01:21:58,753
I hurt my family, you lost your job
anyway-- I did it for nothing!

708
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:00,764
No, not for nothing.

709
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:04,165
Nobody has ever done anything
like that for me before.

710
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:08,167
You were right. You can't win
no matter what you do.

711
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:11,697
Listen to me. I don't want
to hear that from you. You can.

712
01:22:13,645 --> 01:22:15,738
I used to think so.

713
01:22:37,335 --> 01:22:39,428
Dr. Houseman, can l, uh--

714
01:22:40,905 --> 01:22:43,965
Look, I'm going anyway and I know
what you must be thinking.

715
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:47,011
You don't know
anything at all about me.

716
01:22:47,078 --> 01:22:49,774
I know you want Baby
to be like you.

717
01:22:49,848 --> 01:22:52,681
The kind of person
people look up to.

718
01:22:52,751 --> 01:22:54,946
Baby is like that.
If you could just see--

719
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,955
Don't you tell me what to see.

720
01:22:58,023 --> 01:23:00,617
I see someone in front of me
who got his partner in trouble...

721
01:23:00,692 --> 01:23:03,058
and sent her off
to some butcher...

722
01:23:03,128 --> 01:23:06,393
while he moved on to an innocent,
young girl like my daughter.

723
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:14,197
Yeah, I guess that's
what you would see.

724
01:23:29,721 --> 01:23:32,986
I can't imagine being here
without you even one day.

725
01:23:33,058 --> 01:23:36,789
Just think, you have more time
for horseshoes and croquet.

726
01:23:39,698 --> 01:23:42,462
Maybe they'll saw you
in seven pieces now.

727
01:23:44,869 --> 01:23:46,962
I guess we surprised everybody.

728
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:51,274
I guess we did.

729
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:01,218
Hardly would be sorry.

730
01:24:03,254 --> 01:24:04,687
Neither will l.

731
01:24:12,063 --> 01:24:13,496
I'll see ya.

732
01:25:09,687 --> 01:25:11,621
I'll do your hair.

733
01:25:13,758 --> 01:25:15,851
It could look pretty if--

734
01:25:21,766 --> 01:25:24,200
You're prettier your way.

735
01:25:24,269 --> 01:25:25,531
This way.

736
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:52,526
Kellermans, we come together

737
01:25:52,597 --> 01:25:56,590
Singing all as one

738
01:25:56,668 --> 01:26:00,798
We have shared another season's

739
01:26:00,872 --> 01:26:04,808
Talent, play and fun

740
01:26:04,876 --> 01:26:09,006
Summer days will soon be over

741
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:13,210
Soon the autumn starts

742
01:26:13,284 --> 01:26:17,220
And tonight the memories whisper

743
01:26:17,288 --> 01:26:20,655
Softly in our hearts

744
01:26:21,726 --> 01:26:25,594
Join hands and hearts and voices

745
01:26:25,663 --> 01:26:29,064
Voices, hearts and hands

746
01:26:29,133 --> 01:26:33,069
At Kellerman's
the friendships last

747
01:26:33,137 --> 01:26:37,665
Long as the mountain stands

748
01:26:37,742 --> 01:26:42,008
Daytime, nighttime, any hour

749
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:45,948
Weather rain or shine

750
01:26:46,017 --> 01:26:50,181
Games and lectures
Jokes and music

751
01:26:50,255 --> 01:26:54,316
Happily combine

752
01:27:07,705 --> 01:27:09,639
Good luck in medical school, son.

753
01:27:11,843 --> 01:27:14,368
And I wanted to thank you for your
help with the Penny situation.

754
01:27:14,445 --> 01:27:18,279
- I guess we've all gotten into messes.
- What?

755
01:27:19,984 --> 01:27:22,782
I thought Baby told you.
Look, I'm not sure.

756
01:27:22,854 --> 01:27:26,051
Penny said so, but you know with girls
like that. They're liable to pin it...

757
01:27:26,124 --> 01:27:28,058
on any guy around.

758
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:36,926
- What's the hot tip for the day?
- Finished.

759
01:27:38,002 --> 01:27:40,869
You and me, Tito.
We've seen it all, eh?

760
01:27:40,939 --> 01:27:46,036
Bubbah and Zeda serving the first
pasteurized milk to the boarders.

761
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:48,305
Through the war years
when we didn't have any meat.

762
01:27:48,379 --> 01:27:51,075
Through the Depression
when we didn't have anything.

763
01:27:51,149 --> 01:27:53,617
Lots of changes, though, Max.

764
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:57,177
It's not the changes
so much this time.

765
01:27:57,255 --> 01:27:59,815
It's that it all seems
to be ending.

766
01:27:59,891 --> 01:28:03,884
You think kids want to come with their
parents and take fox-trot lessons?

767
01:28:03,962 --> 01:28:07,125
Trips to Europe,
that's what the kids want.

768
01:28:08,199 --> 01:28:10,793
Twenty-two countries
in three days.

769
01:28:11,869 --> 01:28:14,133
It feels like
it's all slipping away.

770
01:28:15,306 --> 01:28:19,208
But the heartbeats of vacation

771
01:28:19,277 --> 01:28:23,179
There no cares are seen

772
01:28:23,247 --> 01:28:27,206
So let's join in
just one last chorus

773
01:28:27,285 --> 01:28:30,652
Visitors, staff and guests

774
01:28:30,722 --> 01:28:35,250
What we've shared
won't be forgotten

775
01:28:35,326 --> 01:28:38,386
Old friends are the best

776
01:29:13,931 --> 01:29:15,660
Nobody puts Baby in the corner.

777
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:18,834
Come on.

778
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:41,785
Sorry about
the disruption, folks...

779
01:29:41,859 --> 01:29:45,124
but I always do
the last dance of the season.

780
01:29:45,196 --> 01:29:48,188
This year somebody told me not to.

781
01:29:48,266 --> 01:29:52,066
So I'm gonna do my kind of dancin'
with a great partner...

782
01:29:52,904 --> 01:29:55,839
who's not only
a terrific dancer...

783
01:29:55,907 --> 01:29:58,375
but somebody who's taught me
that there are people...

784
01:29:58,443 --> 01:30:01,469
willing to stand up for other people
no matter what it costs them.

785
01:30:02,847 --> 01:30:05,372
Somebody who's taught me...

786
01:30:07,351 --> 01:30:09,444
about the kind of person
I want to be.

787
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:12,088
Miss Frances Houseman.

788
01:30:12,924 --> 01:30:14,357
Sit down, Jake.

789
01:31:38,142 --> 01:31:40,235
I think she gets this from me.

790
01:34:34,785 --> 01:34:37,583
Do you have sheet music
on this stuff?

791
01:34:45,663 --> 01:34:48,757
I know you weren't the one
who got Penny in trouble.

792
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:53,403
When I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong.

793
01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:01,878
You looked wonderful out there.

794
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:01,663
Now l

795
01:36:01,739 --> 01:36:05,698
Had the time of my life

796
01:36:05,776 --> 01:36:09,940
No, I never felt
this way before

797
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:12,414
Yes, I swear

798
01:36:12,483 --> 01:36:17,011
It's so true
And I owe it all to you

799
01:39:03,454 --> 01:39:06,855
Wow! What a groovy, boss summer
this has been, cousins.

800
01:39:06,924 --> 01:39:10,792
'63 will go down in history as
the best summer for me-- hope you too.

801
01:39:10,861 --> 01:39:14,262
And girls, please remember that you
promised to respect him in the morning.

802
01:40:05,182 --> 01:40:09,118
