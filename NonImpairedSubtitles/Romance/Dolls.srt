00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:39,799
a TAKESHI KITANO film

4
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,169
We re ready.

5
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,708
It's time. Here goes.

6
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:37,489
"I beg you. Calm thyself.
Rashness will come to no good."

7
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:43,362
"Thou hast become enslaved

8
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:56,104
to such a miserable state of mind."

9
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:11,457
"Who hast led thee to such a state?"

10
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:17,897
"God have mercy. It Is none other than I."

11
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:25,543
"I, Umekawa, is all to be blamed."

12
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:34,111
"Shall I be thankful to thee?"

13
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:42,293
"Or shall I pity thee?"

14
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:09,118
"Read thou my heart." She beguiled him.

15
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:19,662
The tears she shed
fell on the gold coins.

16
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:28,636
And her tears shone like globeflowers

17
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:31,303
covered by dew.

18
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:38,779
It was indeed a sight,
which drew forth

19
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:54,826
pity from one's heart.

20
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:19,049
All the gold Chubei spent

21
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:22,023
was not his to possess.

22
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:26,595
Thus, glory was ephemeral.

23
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,494
A way they fled

24
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:44,207
to yonder and beyond
where their feet guided them.

32
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,715
The leashed beggars.

33
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,168
Leashed beggars!

34
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,147
Well, hello.

35
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:13,980
Hi.

36
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:18,784
So, Matsumoto's bride isn't Sawako.

37
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:20,789
Evidently not.

38
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:26,158
When I got the invitation,
I thought they finally got hitched

39
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,830
but I was wrong.

40
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,870
He's marrying
our company president s daughter.

41
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:34,870
You're kidding.

42
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,502
The family seems to like him.

43
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,536
So, he's a Cinderella boy.

44
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,550
He's now a way ahead of us.

45
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,314
Whatever happened to Sawako?

46
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,388
Must have broken up nicely.

47
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,432
Never thought Matsumoto was such a guy.

48
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,199
Why not take the opportunity?

49
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,366
Yeah, the shortcut to success.

50
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:12,068
In 2 years, we'll have to
speak politely to him.

51
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,843
The president is kind enough to...

52
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,915
I'm already engaged.

53
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,710
Forget her. You re not married yet.

54
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,518
Think about your life.

55
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,417
Your father worked hard,

56
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,424
but with little success,
because he's not a college graduate.

57
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,459
Why do you think
he made you go to college?

58
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,130
Think it over.

59
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,924
It s about your life.

60
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,069
This is a great opportunity.

61
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,965
You must know that.

62
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,570
I can't leave her.

63
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,307
We II go and apologize to her.

64
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,137
We'll beg her... do anything.

65
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,282
What?

66
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,611
Congratulations.

67
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,215
I'm happy for you.

68
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,116
Excuse me, sir.

69
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,616
You have a visitor.
She says she's Sawako's friend.

70
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:40,864
Hey.

71
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:45,926
What's up?

72
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,470
An old friend's here.

73
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,803
Forgot to invite him.

74
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,340
I see.

75
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,364
So, you chose success?

76
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,901
Sawako chose suicide.

77
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,161
She died?

78
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,797
No, she survived, but not completely.

79
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,639
She lost her sanity.

80
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,741
Doesn't even recognize me.

81
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,577
She s as good as dead.

82
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,213
Where is she now?

83
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,418
Hospital.

84
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:37,544
Which one?

85
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,555
She won't recognize you.

86
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,183
Sawako chose suicide.

87
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,927
She won't recognize you.

88
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,543
It's delicious.

89
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,132
You can have more.

90
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:06,390
Whatever happened to him?

91
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,024
Heard he took off.

92
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,102
What about the wedding?

93
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,634
I guess it値l be cancelled.

94
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,997
Okay, collect the trash.

95
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:20,794
Put the trash in here. Okay.

96
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,373
Still some over there.

97
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,062
Why the hell did you
take off from the wedding?

98
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,711
The bride was in tears,
and the president was furious.

99
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,777
Can you lend me money?

100
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:32,481
What are you...

101
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,653
Whatever you have now.

102
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,165
What do you plan to do?

103
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,230
Better apologize quickly
or you'll be doomed.

104
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,098
Thanks a million.

105
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,972
I'll get in touch with you soon.

106
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,733
Hey, Matsumoto.

107
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,860
Where did you come from?

108
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,955
What s your name?

109
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:41,223
Sir... Your lady seems to be...

110
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,089
Don稚 leave the room by yourself.

111
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,892
You値l give trouble to the hotel.

112
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,074
I値l take care of everything.

113
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:20,656
Hello.

114
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:26,456
Yes... I understand...

115
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,693
Sorry, sorry.

116
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:05,661
Give them to me.

117
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:15,544
Yeah...

118
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,842
I know...

119
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,689
...But Sawako
isn't feeling so great.

120
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,286
I heard.

121
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,191
They say she's lost her mind.

122
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:34,298
Is it true?

123
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,472
Hello? . . Hello?

124
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,038
Hello?

125
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,342
Hey, Matsumoto.

126
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,216
Are you from around here?

127
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,262
Where do you live?

128
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,398
Is anything the matter?

129
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,223
You know her?

130
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,096
Yes.

131
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,770
Can you pay for them?

132
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,434
Let me...

133
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,337
Come on...

134
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:26,047
Let me see them.

135
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,025
Do you want to try that out?

136
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,429
Go ahead. Open it and try it.

137
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,543
Wait... Let me.

138
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,929
Like this.

139
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:41,681
Let me. You blow it... Like this.

140
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,860
It's cold. Let's go in.

141
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,135
You'll catch cold.

142
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:29,805
Here.

143
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:21,150
Watch out, you morons.
What s wrong with you?

144
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,602
I'll buy you a new one.

145
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:14,932
Forgive me.

146
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,403
Boss, it's done.

147
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,738
We've finished loading.

148
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:25,108
Thank you very much.

149
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,113
We appreciate it.

150
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,342
We II be off then.

151
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,944
It was his choice.

152
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:57,999
Boss.

153
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,600
He II be guarding you.

154
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:04,731
I m Ikeuchi, sir. I'm starting today.

155
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,087
Is your mother well?

156
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,025
Yeah.

157
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,357
I see.

158
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,703
Yeah... Hey.

159
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:43,936
Thank you.

160
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,944
- Say hello to her.
- Sure.

161
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:03,364
That's my (yakuza) brother's son.

162
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:42,331
What's with those guys? Some weirdos.

163
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:04,853
Excuse me.

164
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:19,768
Where did you say you came from?

165
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,603
The Takigawa Family, sir.

166
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:26,874
OH, yeah... In Hiroshima, right?

167
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,647
How long have you been with us?

168
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:32,413
2 years, sir.

169
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:33,920
Is that right?

170
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:37,785
Not easy, is it?

171
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:42,626
Why did you become a yakuza?

172
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:47,602
When I was a kid,
I used to fight all the time.

173
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:50,571
Became a yakuza, because I was bad.

174
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:54,904
Being strong in fights
doesn't mean anything nowadays.

175
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,409
Better use your head.

176
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:08,455
Being tough did mean something
...in the good ol' days.

177
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:58,840
After you ice him,
stay away from my place.

178
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:04,805
You have to kill even
your (yakuza) brother at times.

179
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,603
Go ahead.

180
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:19,212
Brother, you're killing me, too?

181
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,608
Sorry about it.

182
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,449
Do it.

183
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:37,361
Too bad... We were really close.

184
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,198
The doctor s here.

185
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,864
Oh, okay.

186
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:23,837
Damn quack. I can稚 tell
whether I'm getting better or worse.

187
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:28,377
He never says anything straight.

188
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:36,387
Maybe I haven't got
much time ahead of me.

189
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:41,461
Are you single?

190
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,027
No woman?

191
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:45,933
Not now.

192
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:47,036
How come?

193
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:50,638
Because women get in our way.

194
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:55,743
So you're an old fashioned chap, huh?

195
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,312
Am I?

196
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:01,080
I used to be like you.

197
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:05,885
It's me.

198
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,115
You surprised me.

199
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:09,817
Here. I made lunch for you, too.

200
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:16,325
Wow. This is terrific.

201
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:17,795
Will you eat it?

202
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:18,731
I will.

203
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:20,428
Here.

204
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:21,731
Thank you.

205
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:25,807
It certainly looks good.

206
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:33,313
How is it?

207
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,678
It's delicious.

208
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:35,943
I'm glad.

209
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:50,194
I'm going out...

210
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:51,196
Yes, sir.

211
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:52,928
Take me to Saitama.

212
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:53,932
Sir?

213
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,105
Today's Saturday, right?

214
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:57,671
Yes.

215
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:13,990
Brought them from the shop.

216
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:15,681
Won't they be angry?

217
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:17,793
No, these were left over.

218
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:20,895
Next Saturday, I値l make the lunches.

219
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:30,997
I might not be able to come next week.

220
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:33,066
Are you busy?

221
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:36,337
Yes... Well, no...

222
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,043
I'm thinking of quitting work.

223
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:49,090
Not much work at the factory
and it may go bankrupt.

224
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:55,661
I think I'll do the owner
a favor by quitting early.

225
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:59,428
He's a great guy,
and can稚 tell me to quit.

226
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:03,263
I see.

227
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:16,079
I'll find a more worthwhile job.

228
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:24,559
The way I am now,
I can't make you happy.

229
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:32,261
Being half-assed isn't good,
so it might be better

230
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:38,733
to be alone for a while.

231
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:45,874
So, don't care about me, Ryoko,
and go your own way.

232
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:03,231
I'll come see you when I'm ready.

233
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:07,966
When I come I'll be dressed well, too.

234
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:14,109
You'll be surprised that
I've made something of myself.

235
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:26,488
Well, I'll be going.

236
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,524
See you.

237
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:58,215
Hiro!

238
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:02,220
I'll wait for you.

239
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,787
I値l make lunch,
and be here every Saturday.

240
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:10,023
I値l make lunch and wait for you.

241
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:19,735
I値l make lunch,
and be here every Saturday.

242
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:23,742
I値l make lunch and wait for you.

243
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,100
Wait here.

244
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,203
Yes, sir.

245
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:00,815
What is this place?

246
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:04,552
Don't ask me such things.

247
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:05,686
Sorry.

248
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:15,744
The woman in question.

249
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:16,510
Who?

250
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,419
She comes here every Saturday
at noon with 2 box-lunches

251
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,758
and waits for her beau.

252
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:40,603
Excuse me. May we sit here?

253
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:48,383
I'm sorry. I promised to eat lunch
with my boyfriend here.

254
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:52,113
Can you keep it vacant?

255
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:47,702
Hey, there hasn't been any hit.

256
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:48,833
Sorry, sir.

257
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,675
How come there's no hit here?

258
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:53,713
Sorry, sir.

259
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:55,180
Forget the sorry, sir

260
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,446
Hey, did you put bait on my line?

261
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:00,219
Yes, tangerine.

262
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,220
Tangerine?

263
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:01,722
Yes, sir.

264
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:02,847
Tangerine as bait?

265
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:03,686
Yes, sir.

266
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:05,251
For fish?

267
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:06,019
Yes, sir.

268
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,529
How can you catch fish
with tangerine, you moron?

269
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:12,065
This is ridiculous. Let s go.
