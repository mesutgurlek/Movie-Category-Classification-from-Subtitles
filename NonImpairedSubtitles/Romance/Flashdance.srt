- As long as it´s on the menu.

Now, more important,
did you go to the repertory?

206
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,990
l meant to. l was going to go
yesterday, but l didn´t have time.

207
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,270
- You must make the time, child.
- l know.

208
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,637
Remember the first time
you took me to see them dance?

209
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,392
l have dreams about it.

210
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,997
Dreaming is wonderful, but it won´t
get you closer to what you want.

211
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,277
But l´ve saved money, so if they take me,
l can support myself.

212
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,595
But, child, they won´t take you
unless you apply and audition.

213
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,196
- l know, but sometimes...
- Alexandra, you are 18 years old.

214
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,193
Do it now! Do it!

the son and the holy spirit.

220

Help it, l mean.

Also, l told a lie.

226

Well, l didn´t have to, but...

227
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,159
All l wanted to do
is to make her happy.

228
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,788
Hanna wanted me
to get the application.

229
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,748
l couldn´t tell her that l didn´t have
the courage to go through with it.

230
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,434
lf you had seen all those dancers...

231
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,477
There is no way l belong there.

232

something out of my life.

233

00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,758
l´ll miss you.

633
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,396
Can´t forget my hat.

634
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,672
Good luck.

635
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,118
Give me a turkey sandwich
and a diet 7-U)p.

636
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,315
- l´ve got that.
- Save your money.

637
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,994
- l was buying you lunch.
- l don´t want you buying me anything.

638
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,118
- l don´t want you buying me, period.
- What´s the matter?

639
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,589
- l´ve got eyes.
- What are you talking about?

640
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,309
l didn´t know you were a ballet fan,
l thought you liked it private.

641
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,469
What?

642
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,552
How quickly they forget.
At the dance benefit.

643
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,598
The blonde in the white dress.
Who´s the goddamn blonde?

644
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,637
Blonde?

645
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,198
Blonde?

646
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,193
Wait a minute.
Will you wait a minute?

647
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,873
(Car honking)

648
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:44,318
Wait a minute! What´s going on?
ls everybody crazy?

649
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,948
Last night, some idiot throws
a rock through my window...

650
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,192
- l broke your fucking window!
- You what?

651
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,193
You heard me.
l smashed your stupid window.

652
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,558
Are you crazy?
Are you out of your mind?

653
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,948
Maybe.

654
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,588
lt cost me a $170.
l had to special order it.

655
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,990
You´ve got the money!
Go fuck the blonde!

656
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:07,277
She´s my ex-wife.
We have friends on the Arts Council.

657
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,910
l see her once a year
to take her to the stupid benefit!

658
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,435
Why am l explaining myself?

659
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,960
You didn´t have to break my window.

660
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,998
l did it because...you pissed me off.

661
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,238
(Cheering)

662
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,316
(Soft piano music)

663
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:54,433
When l was a kid all l wanted was
to afford to eat in restaurants like this.

664
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,113
Were you poor?

665
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,475
l was so poor
l had hand-me-down lunches.

666
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,790
lt was rough in the old days.

667
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,116
l used to steal
hubcaps with Johnny C.

668
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,478
You did?

669
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,110
How´s the lobster?

670
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,274
lt sucks.

671
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,790
Want some of mine?

672
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,471
l´m not hungry, thanks.

673
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,116
Whatever turns you on.

674
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,152
What turns you on?

675
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,072
You like phone booths?

676
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,591
Phone booths?

677
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,991
You probably just like
doing it in bed, right?

678
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:18,118
- You two look cosy.
- Alex, this is Katie.

679
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,477
Hello.
Nick has told me all about you.

680
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,789
Hi.

681
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,439
- You´re not really a welder, are you?
- Yes, l really am.

682
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,592
And you really take your
clothes off at night?

683
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:36,998
- l don´t really take them off.
- l was under the impression that you did.

684
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,479
You look great.

685
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,995
You didn´t look this good
when we were married.

686
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,232
- lt was the company l was keeping.
- That was good. That´s funny.

687
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,598
Has he taken you to the steel mill?
He likes to go there on his first date.

688
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,991
- That was your first date, wasn´t it?
- Yeah, it was.

689
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:57,314
As a matter of fact...
l fucked his brains out.

690
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,196
Obviously, you did.

691
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,999
Charmed, dear.

692
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,119
You loved her once, didn´t you?

693
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,672
l thought l did in the beginning.

694
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:21,714
She was different from anyone
l had gone out with before, she was...

695
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:25,031
Well educated.
Came from a real good family.

696
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,991
l figured that l had really made it.

697
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,792
And one day, l realised that...

698
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,831
l´d just taken the safe route.

699
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:46,916
When l realised that, it made it easier
for me to do what l had to do.

700
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,071
What was that?

701
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,514
Let go. Start over again.

702
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:57,630
Figure out what it was
l wanted to do and go after it.

703
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,430
You got it, didn´t you?

704
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,232
How did you do it?

705
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,879
l took a deep breath and jumped.

706
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,195
Hello.

707
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,072
l´d like to apply for admission
to the Repertory Company.

708
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,071
When you fill out this application,

709
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,118
write down all your years
of previous dance training.

710
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,510
Starting with the last school
you attended.

711
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,716
l know that part.

712
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,996
Auditions are by invitation only

713
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,310
and are performed
before the committee

714
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,870
and select members
of the Repertory Company.

715
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,075
Thank you.

716
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,117
You´re welcome.

717
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,959
Good morning.

718
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:21,154
Good morning.
May l help you?

719
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:26,075
Yes. There was a young woman here
a short time ago, wearing an army jacket.

720
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,629
She was here.
l was talking to her...

721
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,189
about admission
to the Repertory Company.

722
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,831
(Murmer of conversation)

723
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,118
Mr Bradley, please.

724
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,599
Nick Hurley.

725
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,075
Larry! Hey.

726
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,151
Great. Great.

727
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,194
Listen, are you still
on the Arts Council?

728
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,230
l need a favour for a special friend.

729
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,750
(lndistinct)

730
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,434
(# DONNA SU)MMER: ´´Romeo´´)

731
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,479
# My baby wears his heart on his sleeves

732
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:45,349
# He wears a look on his face
That says please, please, please, love it

733
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,034
# Everything he wants, love it,
Everything he wants

734
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,237
# l just can´t hesitate
When he wants what he wants

735
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,355
# Oh, chaka...#

736
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,351
He called.

737
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,716
# Oh chaka, oh chaka,
Oh chaka, oh chaka

738
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,235
# Last night he called on the telephone

739
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,470
# And though at two in the morning...#

740
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:11,031
- (Man shouts) Trick or treat?
- Hey, throw that bum out!

741
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,718
l told you they didn´t like
short people down there.

742
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,074
Richie!

743
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,599
Richie!

744
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,320
- Did you check out the clubs there?
- Yeah.

745
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,198
- Come on, what happened?
- One of them offered me a job.

746
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,479
That´s great.

747
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,438
As a waiter. l said,
´´Me, a waiter? You got to be crazy.

748
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,717
´´l can´t take a job as a waiter.
l´m a cook.´´

749
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,029
Hi, Richie.

750
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,628
Hi, Jeanie.

751
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,237
- l missed you.
- All those girls out there?

752
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,231
There were no girls out there.

753
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,153
That´s why you called me every night?

754
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,038
Hey, it´s the cook!

755
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,518
Or is it the comedian?
Nice suit, Richie.

756
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,231
- Let´s go, Jeanie.
- See you later, Richie.

757
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,550
See you around.

758
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,871
(Soft music)

759
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,635
(Screams)

760
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:22,679
The audition!
l got it! l got it!

761
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,037
Nick, wait up!

762
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,669
- Look! Wait!
- What´s going on?

763
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,398
- Read it.
- What?

764
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:36,950
l got the audition, look.
l applied for the Repertory Company.

765
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:40,795
You have to be invited before
you can audition and they invited me.

766
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,350
That´s wonderful.
We have to do something about it.

767
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,475
When?

768
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:48,029
- How about tonight?
- Yes.

769
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,275
Hanna?

770
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:57,153
Hanna?

771
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,159
Well... l did it.

772
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:06,757
l knew you would.
Congratulations.

773
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,956
l´m so excited l can´t stop shaking.

774
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,591
But what if l don´t make it?

775
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,911
You will.
l know you will.

776
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,755
What would l do without you?

777
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,397
l loved the dinner.

778
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,790
And l loved the way
they sat us right away.

779
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:36,279
l loved that there were 50 people
waiting and we just whizzed in.

780
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,750
l called the restaurant last night...

781
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,314
and told them it was
a very special occasion.

782
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,868
What do you mean
you called them last night?

783
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,758
- Stop the car.
- Why?

784
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,512
Stop the goddamn car!

785
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,238
You called them last night

786
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,358
but l didn´t tell you
l got the audition until this morning.

787
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,192
So how the hell did you know?

788
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,828
- Listen.
- Friends on the committee?

789
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,036
Asshole! Stop the car!

790
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,633
- Alex!
