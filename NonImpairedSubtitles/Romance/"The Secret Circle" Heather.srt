Is that why
she grabbed me?

00:10:16,795 --> 00:10:20,581
Because somehow she
knew I was related?

Why would she do
that to a friend?

We don't know
your mother did this.

No...I do know.

Where's your grandmother?

197
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:43,771
At the hospital.
Working the late shift.

198
00:10:43,822 --> 00:10:45,239
She's a nurse.

199
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,624

When I was 10,

200
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,543
she set my arm
when I broke it.

201

I found this.

Is that what I think it is?

203
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:10,314
My family's
Book of Shadows.

204
00:11:10,382 --> 00:11:12,316
I found it
when I first got here.

But how?

206

My mother left it for me.

Can I see it?

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,751
Each of the six families
has their own book,

211
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:33,704
but we've only
found Diana's.

212
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:36,156
Everything we know about who
we are, we got from her book.

213
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,343
But it's specific
to her family.

214
00:11:39,428 --> 00:11:42,996
Different spells,
different histories.

215
00:11:43,048 --> 00:11:46,267
This book is
completely different.

216
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:48,436
We could learn
so much from this.

The Sigil on Heather's arm...
I've seen it in here.

00:11:58,897 --> 00:12:00,698
Here.

219
00:12:01,616 --> 00:12:04,235
That's
my mother's handwriting.

220
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:07,688
She had to be the one
to put the spell on Heather.

221
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:09,540
I need to know why.

222
00:12:09,624 --> 00:12:11,992
It's a suppression
spell of some kind.

223
00:12:12,043 --> 00:12:13,794
Why would my mother do that?

224
00:12:13,862 --> 00:12:15,663
She would never hurt
someone like this.

If we can undo this spell, then
she can tell us what happened.

If it even works.

327
00:18:03,044 --> 00:18:04,428
and I can't find it.

328
00:18:04,512 --> 00:18:05,596
That's enough.

329
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,350
Oh, come on, don't
be like that.

330
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:12,820
I thought you needed help.

331
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:14,688
You're going to help me?

332
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:18,391
Sure. If you let me read
your book, why not?

333
00:18:18,443 --> 00:18:19,660
You need my help.

334
00:18:19,727 --> 00:18:21,612
And to be honest, I
have never understood

335
00:18:21,696 --> 00:18:24,448
why we're not
better friends.

336
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:52,579
Let's go.

337
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,317
You conveniently left out
the haunted house part.

338
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:14,968
Yes.

339
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,993
Come on.

340
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,733
This is really creepy.

341
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:37,240
Your mother did this?

342
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,177
Why?

343
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:42,963
I don't know. That's what
I'm hoping to find out.

344
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:44,748
I mean, seriously.

345
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,200
What could anyone
do to deserve...

346
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:49,686
Your mother must have been
one mean ass witch--

347
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:51,605
Faye. Please.

348
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:52,689
Can we just try
to help her?

349
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:54,024
I'm sorry.

350
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:56,426
Let's do this.

351
00:19:56,477 --> 00:19:58,562
I'm going to apply the stuff
that Adam and I made

352
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:00,314
and then we'll do
the chant together.

353
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:01,398
Will it work?

354
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:02,449
I have no idea.

355
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:03,450
I don't know what
the spell is,

356
00:20:03,534 --> 00:20:04,618
I don't know
what the words mean,

357
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:06,119
I don't even know how
to pronounce them.

358
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:07,738
Ok, we can do this.

359
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,773
You dragged me all
the way out here,

360
00:20:09,824 --> 00:20:12,942
so let's get
to the bottom of it.

"Rongaire balorum
eunarach vicit romnia."

"Rongaire balorum
eunarach vicit romnia."

363
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:51,948
Again?

364
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:57,537
Rongaire balorum
eunarach vicit romnia.

365
00:20:57,622 --> 00:21:00,874
Rongaire balorum
eunarach vicit romnia.

[Sighs]

367
00:21:11,335 --> 00:21:13,770
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:13,838 --> 00:21:15,389
I thought it would work.

369
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:17,391
[Door opens]

370
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:22,779
[Rustling]

371
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,853
Maybe we did it wrong?

372
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,020
Or I screwed
up the potion?

373
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,272
Can we talk about
this in the car?

374
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:06,857
Far away from here.

375
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,358
Thanks for trying.

376
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:11,778
I know I don't come across
like I care about much...

377
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,530
But my dad died that night.

378
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:15,916
I don't think my mom's
ever gotten over it.

379
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,784
And I want to know what
happened just as much as anyone.

380
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,536
I guess we're all
in the same boat.

381
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:22,038
Yep, a boat full of sad witches.

382
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:26,460
So how about we go back to your
place and check out the book?

383
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:27,844
Another time.

384
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:32,682
I'd say I've earned
a peek, wouldn't you?

385
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,267
Yes.

Oh, my God.

the hell's happening?

I came to apologize.

398
00:24:01,446 --> 00:24:03,897
I overreacted.

399
00:24:03,949 --> 00:24:06,400
You think?

400
00:24:06,451 --> 00:24:10,287
I saw you with that other
girl and I just went off.

401
00:24:10,372 --> 00:24:11,738
I'm sorry.

402
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,957
Yeah?

403
00:24:14,426 --> 00:24:17,845
Faye was saying some things and
I made the mistake of listening.

404
00:24:17,912 --> 00:24:19,463
Like what?

405
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:21,915
[Sighs] It doesn't matter.

406
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:23,517
Just stupid things.

407
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:25,936
It's not like you're my
boyfriend or anything,

408
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:29,440
so I don't have
the right to be jealous.

409
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,310
Ok.

410
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:40,067
So...We're good?

411
00:24:40,118 --> 00:24:44,321
Yeah. We're good.

412
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:51,879
I'm sorry for putting
you in the middle

413
00:24:51,947 --> 00:24:54,048
of this thing with Cassie.

414
00:24:54,115 --> 00:24:57,084
I understand why you
don't want to do this.

415
00:24:57,135 --> 00:24:59,953
I just know how badly Cassie
wants to find answers.

416
00:25:00,005 --> 00:25:00,888
You know.

417
00:25:00,955 --> 00:25:02,089
Well, I'm glad she didn't.

418
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,474
Because I went back
to my book.

419
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:06,260
I knew there was something about
that symbol that bugged me.

420
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:08,896
Look at this.

421
00:25:08,963 --> 00:25:11,732
These are all ubilaz markings.

422
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:15,402
Uh...really old, black magic.

[Inhales]

426
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:26,113
The notes here are all
about using snakes and insects

427
00:25:26,181 --> 00:25:27,981
as vessels for dark energy.

428
00:25:28,033 --> 00:25:30,084
Forcing them inside someone.

429
00:25:30,151 --> 00:25:32,536
I think the Sigils are meant
to keep it from coming back out.

This is way beyond witchcraft.

432
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:39,426
It's seriously dark magic.

433
00:25:39,494 --> 00:25:40,978
None of this was
in Cassie's book.

434
00:25:41,046 --> 00:25:43,847
If she'd known about this, she
never would have tried the spell.

That's kinda
the point I was making.

436

I've got to call her.

437
00:25:48,853 --> 00:25:51,105
Why? She didn't
do the spell.

438

But she still
needs to know.

439

I tried to help her
take you away.

461

She did.

462
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,745
She took me
far away from here.

463

She wanted you
to be safe.

She tried to
leave that night.

465
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,118
What night?

466
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:10,204
Do you mean
the night of the fire?

Can you tell me
what happened that night?

468
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,962
She was trying
to stop it.

469
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:19,931
She wanted to protect us.
