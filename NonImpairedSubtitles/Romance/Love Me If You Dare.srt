1
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,993
Love Me If You Dare

2
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I like this game very much.

3
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Housing game, when the the banker lost.

4
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,993
I like bead game, I win;
Jumping game is for fools.

5
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,993
Unless girls.

6
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,993
I don't play guessing game; the
house-jumping is quite good for two persons.

7
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hide-and-seek is
quite good too.

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But you can't play one game.

9
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I say, never.

10
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Even your best friend suggests.

11
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,993
It's a game that bury yourself
into a heap of concrete.

12
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,993
This game started
with a beautiful house.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,993
A bus without driver.

14
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
A beautiful box.

15
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,993
A beautiful friend.

16
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
In fact, I made a mistake.
This game started long long ago.

17
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,993
It started with a sick word.

18
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Like: Transfer.

19
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why not mammouth?

20
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This made mother crys.

21
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
In all, doctor, thay
don't like anything.

22
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Your situation is very
urgent...They all talk nonsense.

23
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Their trousers are too bad.

24
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,993
Look! Imagine that what
they know about mothers.

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,993
Also some unlovely word, Like Kowalsky.

26
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Don't search anymore. I
don't want to refer it.

27
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Kowalsky.

28
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Polish! And.

29
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't forget the disgusting faces.

30
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
All this is the same thing.

31
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That is "I don't feel well".

32
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,993
"No one feels so bad like
me on the Earth and Mars."

33
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You love her. Wei?

34
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,993
Me too. I think she is
very pretty. Give it to me.

35
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This is really cowry, right?

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh! I have never seen a beautiful
rounded playground like this.

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Never, never.

38
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No. I have seen it, but not on Earth.

39
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Me too.

40
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,993
Where? Is it real? Does it really exit?

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes. My angel, here.

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,991
And here.

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,991
And here.

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Julien, you go by bus tomorrow morning.

45
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I will stay with mother for some time.

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Let's go.

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,993
Go, go, My Juju, go.

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Mother! You forget your cowry. Keep it.

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,993
My only cowry is you.

50
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh...

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,991
Ok.

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Oh! Dirty Polish.

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh! Dirty Polish.

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Sophie? No. I am a dirty Polish.

55
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh! dirty Polish.

56
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
There isn't any precious
things that day with Sophie.

57
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,993
So I will share with her.

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Will you pay me back?

59
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If you really want it,
please prove it. Dare you?

60
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is the start.

61
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,993
All the things begin.

62
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,993
My bus! Oh, no.

63
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,991
Dare.

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What did you do? Please answer me.

65
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Nothing.

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't want to be hurt! Stop.

67
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Stop! Shut up!

68
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Julien! I don't want to be hurt.

69
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He will not. He dare not..

70
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Don't beat him.

71
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You don't have the right to beat him.

72
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Shut up! Think twice.

73
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Father doesn't like Sophie.

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He doesn't like her from the beginning.

75
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The game started successfully.

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If the box is in her hand,
she asks me to prove it.

77
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I do it to win the box back.

78
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,993
So I give Sophie a guaranty.
It is absurd, isn't it?

79
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Foolish game? Perhaps.

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,993
But this is our game.

81
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,991
1X7?

82
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,991
2X7?

83
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
3X7?

84
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,991
21.

85
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
4X7? 28.

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,991
5X7?

87
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
35. 6X7?

88
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,991
42.

89
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
7X7?

90
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,991
49.

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Please show me some common
nouns begin with "A".

92
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,991
One.

93
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
One.

94
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
"Animals".

95
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Any else? Sylvie?

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Abricot.Very good.

97
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Abricot.Very good.

98
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The common nouns begin with "B", Sophie?

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The common nouns begin with "B", Sophie?

100
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The common nouns begin with "B", Sophie?

101
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
"Brouter".

102
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
"Braguette", "Bistouquette".

103
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Shut up! "Bigleux".

104
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Go away.

105
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The short fat ugly girl.

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Do you feel interesting, miss?

107
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I signed you zero, zero begin eith Z.

108
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Go to the headmaster's office.

109
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll see weather you laugh or not.

110
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Julien, what are you
doing? Go with Sophie.

111
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Go to the headmaster's office.

112
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
"Bander".

113
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What? Bander begins with "B".

114
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,991
Discipline.

115
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Discipline is the basic of respect.

116
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Without respect, it's
the end of civilization.

117
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Most residents.

118
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Came down.

119
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Corrupt politics! Whose
contribution is it?

120
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,993
Miss Kowalsky and Mr. Janvier!

121
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Dare. Say it again, Mr. Janvier.

122
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let me share it.

123
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What do your poor brain think of?

124
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Dare you interrupt me?

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,993
Imagine it, sir.

126
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,993
It's really a great
game, but no one laughs.

127
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,991
Detach them.

128
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Detach them, miss.

129
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We are detached.

130
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,993
They never dare to do so.

131
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Mr. Janvier, please
meet with miss Kowalsky.

132
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Great spirits meets.

133
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Do you know what the
word "punish" means?

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You have comsidered.

135
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Is it the future prepared for her? Ok.

136
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I am not her mother.

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Vulgarity is not in the lessons.

138
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Miss Kowalsky!

139
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I will meet your parents.

140
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
They don't speak
French. "Bite" in Polish.

141
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,993
Called hammer. Anything else?

142
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Please wait, there must be your profits.

143
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Don't go out or watch TV.

144
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't eat sweets.

145
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
DOn't use light in the aisle.

146
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,993
Go to get your coat.

147
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
No. It's enough. Cool.

148
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,993
Did you do the same thing like me?

149
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Go to your room! Don't disturb mother.

150
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,991
Julien!

151
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,993
Julien...Mother!

152
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We have a good meal!
You are in bed that time.

153
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,991
You are lucky.

154
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,993
You know, My Julien...A
doctor came to see me.

155
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I made five mistakes. Do you know?

156
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Juju...I made ten
mistakes in the elocnte.

157
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,991
Do you want to lister?

158
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,993
I also did a very silly thing.

159
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Friends are like glasses.

160
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
it looks smart, but hard to disapeaer.

161
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,993
And it is fatiguesome. But
luckily, It is cool glasses!

162
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,993
I, I have Sophie.

163
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Now.

164
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Animals begin with "A". Anticot.

165
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Autruche, abruti.

166
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Altaire. Four...Dare or not?

167
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Dare. Zero.

168
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Zero. Go to the headmaster's office.

169
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Discipline.

170
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Forever discipline.

171
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I have told you early.

172
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,991
From now on.

173
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's an end, Eden.

174
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Things get serious.

175
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
My daughter, your
childbirth will be in misery.

176
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You must waer high-heel
shoe and bear banting.

177
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
desquamate operation, and
wrinkle-dispel operation.

178
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And.

179
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You will go kitchen.

180
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
it's not the end. You.

181
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
My son, I leave
something more grisliness.

182
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
crucifixion.

183
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,993
Disaster, dinosuar, atom-war.

184
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Oil tanker wrecking,
misfortune. BUt especially.

185
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Especially! The beautiful mother is ill.

186
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
"There lived a male hare."

187
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,993
"They are bedlamites.""I don't
want to go to see bedlamites."

188
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
"You have on choice."

189
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
"Here are all bedlamites."

190
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,993
mother, will you die?

191
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Do I read well? Will you die?

192
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I will, just like everyone.

193
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Because I do the silly things?

194
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,991
Give!

195
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
let me do some clever things.

196
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I will do it. Don't say it any more.

197
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Dare not.

198
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,993
Close your ears, close your ears hardly.

199
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Can you hear how I love you?

200
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's most important.

201
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
ok. What do you talk about?

202
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,993
Sophie writes with teeth.
It is important, isn't it?

203
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Now one can attract you like Sophie.

204
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,993
Alice can not, your mother can not.

205
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Ok. Use teeth.

206
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
How does she deal with ears?

207
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,993
Can you? Climb alone rops
with your eyes shut out?

208
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Cup on head.

209
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,991
I don't believe you.

210
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,993
Do you think you are the
first playing "Dare or not"?

211
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,991
Ok. Good night.

212
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Mother.

213
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What is the most crazy
thing you have done? Fly?

214
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Fly? How to fly?

215
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Fly in the sky.

216
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Let me see! Be quick.

217
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,993
Fly! Dare.

218
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Later. When?

219
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Soon.

220
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,991
I guarantee.

221
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Tell him the story. What a bad idea!

222
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's you should lie on bed in this case.

223
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Mother.

224
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Will I be punished seriously or lightly?

225
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I want to say.

226
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,993
Sophie invited me to
attend a wedding...No.

227
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,991
Silence.

228
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Her skirt is so ugly.

229
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So does her lover.

230
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
If I get married...You will
not tell the Abba, dare?

231
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,991
Dare, of course.

232
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What will you do when you grown up?

233
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Despot.

234
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Despot? All are enslaved by one?

235
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
yes. A own palace, and many slaves.

236
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I torture them every
Thursday, what about you?

237
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yes...I...No, it's idiotic.

238
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Say it! No.

239
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,991
Say it quickly!

240
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,993
I want to make a flan,a
flan with abricots.

241
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Or crude, a little
hot, in a bread-room.

242
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
flan like cakes?

243
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,993
Sure! Do you think something else?

244
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,993
flan...flan.

245
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Yes, a piece of flan.

246
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,993
Excellent! Dare or not?

247
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,993
Yes, dare.

248
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's ok.

249
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Is this why your pay is better?

250
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The best worker uses the best tool.

251
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's your turn! Look!

252
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
This is my guarantee!
You have no right to copy.

253
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,991
Dare or not?

254
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Dare.

255
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Only this? BUt I can't see anything.

256
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,993
Women are more finished than men.

257
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's easier to be friend like this.

258
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,993
Remove the spread! Dare.

259
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,993
It's your turn, try hard! Dare.

260
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Julien! I am looking for you everywhere.

261
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,993
The violin teacher is ill...We
will discuss it later. Please come.

262
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,991
Mother.

263
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Ny Julien.

264
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Good child...You can get better, yes?

265
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You can get better, dare or not?

266
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,993
You haven't box. It's not
you to give the guarantee.

267
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I will go and get it.

268
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,993
Hold your mother in the arm please.

269
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,993
I will go at once. Then
please show me how to fly.

270
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What will you do coming here?

271
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Julien, I...

272
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Please leave. Father doesn't like.

273
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,993
Sure, I am only a partner to play with.

274
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,993
Next is draging feet. Dare or not?

275
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,993
I do two, and mother will be ok.

276
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,993
I do three, and she will come
back home to celebrate my birthday.

277
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,991
Good!

278
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,993
I do four, and she will come
back home tonight healthily.

279
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,991
Mother.

280
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Mother.

281
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,991
Mother.

282
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,991
Mother.

283
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Mother.

284
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Mother.

285
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,991
Mother.

286
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,991
Mother.

287
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,993
"Auroral life."

288
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,993
I am Julien's father,
are you Sophie's mother?

289
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,991
Her sister.

290
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,991
I want...

291
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It is or not?

292
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,993
Can Sophie come my home tonight?

293
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,993
Are you sllep? Formally, yes.

294
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
there is some hearsay say
that you are pretending.

295
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I saw some slanderous gossip on .

296
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I will sleep for a while.

297
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Can I go to your house
and sleep tomorrow?

298
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
No. You should never come to
my home. Please guarantee it.

299
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Why?

300
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Guarantee it.

301
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Ok.

302
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,991
Good night.

303
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Bad habit is just tarined like this...

304
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I don't mean the broken cup.

305
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,991
But sleep.

306
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,993
Sophie and me, from this night on,
have slept together for ten years.

307
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,993
On the morning, something
serious happened.

308
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,993
Right! On the morning,
something serious happened.

309
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,993
Oh. blamed, blamed.

310
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
What's the time?

311
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
My examination!

312
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
What examination?

313
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Mathematic examination.

314
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,991
You need not to take the examination.

315
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I don't like that.

316
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,993
Ill, yes?

317
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,991
You are ill.

318
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,991
Julien!

319
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Julien!

320
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
What are these noisy things?

321
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Julien!

322
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Open the door.

323
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Blamed! blamed!

324
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,993
Julien! Open the door,
or I will barge in.

325
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,991
Julien!

326
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Give it back to me.

327
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Dare or not?

328
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
No. This morning can't. I am too whiny.

329
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,991
No, this morning.

330
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,993
This morning, Sophie will wear her bra.

331
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Game starts again.

332
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Miss Kowalsky.

333
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,993
Kowalsky, Sophie.Kowalsky.

334
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
The game's rule is silly.

335
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,993
Someone fooled before
changed opposite now.

336
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Do you know what is changing opposite?

337
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,993
Only something about taste.

338
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I am Julien. I am "Go away."

339
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Make my life significative.

340
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,993
Just like play Beethoven on
the blackboard by fingers.

341
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Miss Kowalsky.

342
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Function vectorielle...

343
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
V1xV2 gets the same result as 2 modules.

344
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,993
multiple by the cosine of
the angle which forms them

345
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,993
You seem good at Function vectorielle.

346
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Tell me weather I make a mistake or not.

347
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Miss Kowalsky.

348
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Tell me whether I was wrong.

349
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Your vector begins with a point,

350
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And defined by a fixed amount,

351
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,993
Which is more attractive than others.

352
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Do you think you can do some
research on this theory with me?

353
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
This will be an index number.

354
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Do you usually review
by yourself?    En¡­

355
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,991
This makes me deaf.

356
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
The answer to intrinsic function

357
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
The answer to intrinsic function

358
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Kowalsky

359
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
The square to 3¡­  En¡­

360
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,991
2m+1

361
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
2m+1

362
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I didn't allow you

363
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
To leave here.

364
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
f(x) has two different roots.

365
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
If m is between -1 and 1/3

366
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'll go, this is my
sister. What a pity man.

367
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,993
Be louder, I can't hear.

368
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It works, isn't it? I did it;
don't keep such a straight face.

369
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
What can you do except seduce women?

370
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
The chief examiner
didn't have a good name.

371
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
She thought you are Kawasaky

372
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It's the result to chew up

373
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
No result, you get no mark!

374
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I have faced those
executioners for 20 minutes.

375
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,993
See how comfortable you are!
I never know her that bitch.

376
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And she knows nothing about math.

377
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Aurelie Miller, a taint.

378
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,993
To her there's only two things: She
had had sex with the teacher of PE,

379
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And she had awful earrings.

380
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Do you envy her?

381
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Me? Yes.

382
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Go to get a whore, as you like.

383
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So¡­ you are envying.  Forgive me!

384
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
If you want to know my opinion of
Aurelie, OK, I wish you success.

385
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
You two seems like a pair to death.

386
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Stop. To give her up would be a fault.

387
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Bring me her earrings.

388
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,993
Miss Miller! Aurelie£®Miller

389
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Do you have boyfriend?  Yes.

390
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Now, you have two.

391
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And you? Is that really your sister?

392
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It's she who asked
me to come.   Get out!

393
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
If I scream, the school will be here.

394
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,993
No¡­ Oh!

395
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,991
What are you doing?

396
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You are so coquettish, just like my car.

397
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
That why I like you.

398
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Miller Aurelie

399
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Is she still not here?

400
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
When will we meet again?  
The third semester, partly.

401
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Give me your earrings.

402
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Reflect your golden hair on it.

403
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,993
Let your frozen stiff slave
wallow in your earrings.

404
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,993
You are crazy.

405
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You are crazy. Ok, let me go, Ok?

406
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,993
Forget about those
vectors and functions, OK?

407
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
-Do you believe love at first sight?
-En, yes.

408
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,991
Na?ve.

409
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,993
Aurelie£®Miller¡­ You failed the exam.

410
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Did my wage make you ill?

411
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,993
How is it?   I don't like blond woman.

412
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You did it! You this son of a bitch!

413
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Tyrant

414
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
That's enough! She has nothing at all!

415
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,993
You have forget that PE teacher;
the one with a strong biceps.

416
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I've had sex with him.

417
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
His leg? It's just like your QI.

418
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,993
-You like him, this snowman?
-As the second choice, yes.

419
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,993
What do you mean by ¡°as the second
choice¡±? What's the first one?

420
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,993
It's your turn! Hurry up!

421
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Go away!   Be calm!

422
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Do you know the Easter bet?

423
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
it seems he doesn't know it.

424
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,993
You are all crazy! No!Igor

425
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,991
Let's talk something else.

426
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,993
Kick his ass.

427
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,991
Say you regret!

428
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
That's funny.

429
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Say it!

430
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You should not go.

431
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Look at me carefully, jerk! I dare
do anything; beg me for forgiveness!

432
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
You would get nothing.

433
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,993
Bitch, give me the box.

434
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Kiss me, can you?

435
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,991
I can.

436
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,993
I said: kiss me.

437
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Anything wrong with
you? You are all crazy!

438
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Get off my car, and I'll tell you.

439
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Do you hear me? Get off and I tell you.

440
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Do you hear me?!

441
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Get off!!

442
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,993
You are both louts! Idiots!

443
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,991
Hold me

444
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,991
Love me

445
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,991
I can.

446
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,993
Is this a game to you?

447
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
No, I bet. You started it.

448
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
If I started it, you
would not hold it at once.

449
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,993
Poor taint! You are
going to miss the bus.

450
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
He must be older.

451
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
As a child, we think
it's a slow process.

452
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
But it beats you like a branch.

453
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,993
When someone comes to you,
or your father tells you that:

454
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It's all over! You have unified exam!

455
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Do you remember? Exam,
don't make yourself a loser.

456
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Or I'll announce your
comfortable life an end.

457
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Come on, Dad. It's not
so serious, be gentle.

458
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,991
Be gentle?

459
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You little lout, don't you
feel that I'm now gentle enough?

460
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I'll tell you that

461
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Your game killed my wife

462
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And your mother.

463
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You are so contemptible!   Yes, I am.

464
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm a contemptible
person, not a gentleman.

465
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I'm so contemptible that
bring you up alone! Shit!

466
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
You are rubbish!   Yes, I am.

467
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I can tear your face.

468
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,993
I can't believe that
Sophie poisoned you.

469
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Poisoned you that you
don't say a word to me.

470
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,993
Unless when your friends
take me as the wager.

471
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
You choose it.

472
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
She or me, how is it?

473
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Dare¡­

474
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,991
Or dare not?

475
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Sophie!

476
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,993
Hallo, do you want to see
Sophie? She is not here.

477
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
What are you doing here?
I told you don't come.

478
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You satisfied? You see
it? Is it interesting?

479
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
You promised me

480
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I don't care.   I care!

481
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I see nothing in my eyes,
sorry, I don't know.

482
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Sorry, everything has been changed!

483
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Come on, let's go.   Go where?

484
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Your teenager's room? I
don't need your compassion.

485
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,991
You go by yourself.

486
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Sophie, forgive me!

487
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Go!

488
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Dare or dare not?

489
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,991
You go!

490
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,993
Forgive me, I give a most
difficult bet to Sophie.

491
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
But Sophie never like easy.

492
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
This takes her a long
time, maybe it's too long.

493
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,993
During that time, my
father persuaded me.

494
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Hallo, sir.

495
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,993
Is Julien here?

496
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Excuse me, Mr. Janvier.

497
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I come here to see Julien.

498
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
He is here.

499
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,993
Julien£¬do you hear me?

500
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,993
Keep silent, let me say something.

501
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Do you miss me?

502
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Because I miss you, you this tyrant.

503
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Give you a straight face
is a difficult thing,

504
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
But I still feel that
it's not your illusion.

505
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I want to forget the game when
we are talking. Just one time.

506
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Do you like my skirt? I'm hesitating.

507
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I took it from my sister.
There was once a red one.

508
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Red like a nuclear bomb.

509
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I know this is what I need to wear.

510
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I must be sitting in front
of the mirror for 3 hours.

511
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
But I did it. See, I'm so beautiful.

512
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I hope you like it,
otherwise I'll beat you.

513
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,991
Wait

514
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
What did I say just now?

515
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
The problem is

516
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Even you say ¡°I like
it¡±, I'll not trust you.

517
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I don't know when you are in game,

518
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And when you are not.

519
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I've lost myself.

520
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,993
Wait¡­ I'm not finish.

521
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Say you love me.

522
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I can never say this out first.

523
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,993
I'm afraid you think it's a game.

524
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,993
Help me, please.

525
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,991
Thank you.

526
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,991
Hallo.

527
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Hallo.

528
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Julien

529
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Are you reviewing you courses?

530
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
It seems you are not.

531
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Not now.

532
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
When? Tomorrow?

533
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
One year later. I'm sorry.

534
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Don't say sorry to me.

535
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
¡° City plan¡±, do you really like this?

536
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,993
You are talking to a
expert, HLM, my speciality.

537
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
We had never talked about future.

538
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Us two.

539
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Our two futures.

540
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
¡°Our two futures¡±

541
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Spontaneously, I'd say our future.

542
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You need to believe that
present situation satisfied me.

543
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,993
I dream to see us keeping going
like we've been in these years.

544
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
You are a idiot.

545
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,993
OK, pass the exam, dare or dare not?

546
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I'm sorry.

547
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
¡°I'm sorry, Sophie¡±. Good!

548
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
In fact, wa have talked
about future, just once.

549
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Did I make a mistake,
in some place else?

550
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,993
You want to be a tyrant, to me , a flan

551
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Stop! No, I don't want to delay you.

552
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,993
Go ahead with your job, I have exam
too, I investigate human beings.

553
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
You learn Sociology. What I
refer to is not human beinngs.

554
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
But man.

555
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Male, man, and I have
difficult in review.

556
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Use this, you are in the library.

557
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
There is no better place for
review than here, isn't there?

558
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,991
Yes.

559
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Stop, you are doing something stupid.

560
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Stop. Why?

561
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
It's just a bet. Come
on, let me work over it.

562
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,993
See you one year later.

563
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,991
What happened?

564
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,991
Hmm

565
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You know what I am saying clearly.

566
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,993
Mo, I don't konw, tell me.

567
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
It is not easy to say that.

568
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,993
Can't you wait for one year.

569
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
There, in your study.

570
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Be careful.

571
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,993
You want to hurt me, don't
kidding me, you won't.

572
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Wait for me?

573
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
This is guaranty?

574
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
No.

575
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,993
Then you just go and see.

576
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,993
Sophie!Sophie, I love you.

577
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,993
I love you, I love you, come down.

578
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
What a fool.

579
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Look at the fool sitting on the chair.

580
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
He makes a strange face
because of his lung.

581
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
This is only an excuse.

582
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,993
Isn't it easyer to
hold her in your arms?

583
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Tell her I love her?

584
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,993
You feel your heart beating
when you think of this.

585
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Hey! I am talking to
you! Do you hear that?

586
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,993
Of course you have heard
that, what a snaky fool.

587
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,993
What is worse, your mess is not end.

588
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Do you want something?

589
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Do you have skirt for banquet?

590
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I don't have any banquet.
I will give you two pieces.

591
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I have something to ask you.

592
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
What do you like to drink?

593
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
A cup of coffee.

594
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
A cup of coffee, just this.

595
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Can I have a talk with you. No.

596
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,993
Sorry, but we have something that
we don't agree with each other.

597
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Stupid things... For
example, your shoes.

598
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
My shoes? Yes, it is funny.

599
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Your shoes fit your
trousers well, I swear.

600
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
It attracts my eyes that I
couldn't hear what you said.

601
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,991
Please.

602
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I won't take it off.

603
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
That is you, you want to talk.

604
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Monday, I will be off at
7pm, and I will come later.

605
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
OK. But, in fact,

606
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I have a singing lesson after that.

607
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
You sing?

608
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Yes, this is not my
life, it is only a job.

609
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Isn't it the way you make
the hero save you, is it?

610
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I am sorry, but this is the truth.

611
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I don't mean anything else.

612
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I am glad that you
take the singing lesson.

613
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,993
You want to be a singer? The
first thing is to earn money.

614
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
You pay 100 pounds

615
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
to become Terrisa's mother?

616
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Damn it, I said I wouldn't talk to you.

617
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,993
Your shoes, and your trousers, make
me distracted! Let me do my work.

618
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
How do you do. How do you do.

619
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
How are you? Fine, and you?

620
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,991
Very well.

621
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,993
Can I invite you now?

622
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,991
No.

623
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Where are you going? Don't
ask so many questions.

624
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Monday, you will be off at 7PM.

625
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Today is Tuesday.

626
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,991
Today is Tuesday.

627
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,991
Wait for me.

628
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,993
I want to invite you for dinner.

629
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,993
Go away! You too?

630
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
A serious traffic jam, a truck wants to

631
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Drive back... Have
you got a lover? What?

632
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,991
Have you got a lover?

633
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Why you ask me so? Nothing.

634
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
It's about the inside
contradition oratory

635
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,993
Contradition oratory! That
is conversation, isn't it?

636
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,993
So, do you have a lover?

637
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
You don't have to answer,
it is only a question.

638
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I don't have someone else
in bed, if you want to know.

639
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
He is a soccer player,
Sergei Nimov Nimovitch

640
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,993
Forget it, I've give
him up this morning.

641
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
How cant you go out
with such arrant person?

642
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I am tired of staying out for night.

643
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Is there nobody else since this morning?

644
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Except for Sergei? Greg, his
friend, Jerome and his father.

645
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
A French, two and three Kevin's

646
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Prince Cendrillon

647
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,993
They are not serious, just for fun.

648
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Very beautiful restaurant!
Champagne, please.

649
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,993
You did a good job. I
think you are tempting me.

650
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,993
Is this so impossible in your eyes?

651
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Have you seen the girl downstairs?

652
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Her skirt

653
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
is the same with the
one I dressed before.

654
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
How long ago? Four years?

655
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,991
I have seen it.

656
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
That doesn't fit her.
What a dress up person.

657
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Did I look so stupid before?

658
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Don't say that, you don't know her.

659
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
You didn't either.

660
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Does it matter?

661
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Hey, have you got the certificate?

662
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,993
My certificate is nothing remarkable.

663
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Cheers.

664
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,993
Cheers for this moment, and
the things I have done for you.

665
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I have waited for
years to tell you this.

666
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,993
Tell me what?

667
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Tell you myself.

668
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
But you have been talking about youself.

669
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,993
Then say something.

670
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,991
My heart,

671
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Sophie, I have got a lover.

672
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,993
You have got a lover...
Just this? No, not like this.

673
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,993
For years, keep silent for years.

674
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,991
I want to marry,

675
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,991
Do you agree?

676
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
You are asking me ?

677
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
You remember.

678
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Did I say I want to marry you?

679
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,993
Yes you did. What did you say?

680
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,993
You... you really want to marry?

681
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Because I need you.

682
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,993
Of course, marriage, is not
only one person's matter.

683
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,993
You keep them for the day you marry.

684
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Listen, this.

685
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,991
Do you agree?

686
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
You agree?

687
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
You agreed.

688
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,993
She agree! She agree.

689
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,993
You will be my chief
witness at wedding ceremony

690
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Thank you, Sophie, I will introduce you.

691
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
My fiancee, Christelle,
she is beautiful, isn't she?

692
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
No.

693
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
She is dressing the skirt
you dressed four years ago.

694
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,993
You tell me you will never hurt me.

695
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,991
Yes.

696
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Gift.

697
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,991
We get apart.

698
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Are you introducing for us?

699
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Christelle,Sophie

700
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
My future

701
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,991
My past

702
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Get up,my child.

703
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Now,tell each other that you'll

704
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Christelle

705
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
My child

706
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Christelle Louise Bouchard

707
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Do you want to tell each other,

708
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,991
in the god's house

709
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Christelle

710
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Will you marry

711
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Julien Antoine Janvier,love him

712
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
cherish him,until death take you apart

713
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I will

714
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I will

715
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And you

716
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
My son,Julien

717
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Antoine Janvier,will you marr

718
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Christelle Louise Bouchard

719
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Love her,cherish her

720
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,993
Until death take you apart

721
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Julien !

722
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Wake up,we are waiting for your promise

723
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Will you

724
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
marry

725
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Christelle?

726
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Yes,I will

727
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Good,so,my son,

728
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
if someone

729
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Me!Me! I don't agree

730
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
on this marriage

731
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Julien is already engaged to me.

732
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Get her out.

733
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Julien!

734
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Ask her to get out!

735
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Tell'em,do you dare
to?    Please go away.

736
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Julien!

737
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
You have problems,you've
never finished your oedipe

738
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
You can never fuck her.

739
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
You pray for your life,not control it.

740
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
No,dad.

741
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Stop!  Okay,i stop

742
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I stop everything.

743
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Look at me,Julien,look at me.

744
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
It's the last time  you look at me.

745
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
You've looked my face
enough,now it's over.

746
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,991
The game is over.

747
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
You don't exist anymore!

748
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,993
You are deleted in my life.

749
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
A girl's lies...

750
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,993
Don't do this,it's a game.  Let go of me

751
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
What a magnific bad woman.

752
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
This kind of friend,things
can only be in this way.

753
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Isn't she great? Be ready all the time.

754
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Be scrunched by a
train.That's just a joke.

755
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,991
A kid's bet

756
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,991
Julien!

757
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
What's marriage?
Beautiful suits,champagne

758
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Some cream dessert. That's enough

759
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,993
Okay,you can do it next week.

760
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Julien!

761
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,993
You love yourself,this is
the important thing,isn't it?

762
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Julien,do you hear me?

763
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I can be a real chief
witness at your wedding.

764
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I'll be serious,I swear.

765
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,991
I won't spit.

766
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
What's this?

767
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Julien!

768
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Julien,can I move?

769
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,993
Julien,don't joke.

770
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,991
Go to hell.

771
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,993
Okay,you go with me.

772
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
We haven't seen each other for 10 years.

773
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,991
Coming!

774
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Sophie!

775
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,993
Don't say anything,Sergei

776
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Hey?

777
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,991
Nothing.

778
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Where is it?The proposition
from the Club of D1?

779
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I don't know,i've not called them.

780
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Okay,we don't need to
see each other again.

781
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
If you want to cast me away for weeks

782
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Make a reservation. I've done
enough with small savings.

783
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I don't live with a "football player"

784
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Do you think you can hold
me by your poor salary?

785
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I will make some money.
 I want big money.

786
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,993
The big bingo,the super
cagnotte on Friday,13th.

787
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I'm good for that,right?

788
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,993
Yes.

789
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
And here,it's the worst.

790
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Nothing,it's nothing in 10 years

791
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
After 3652 days and 3653
nights,I got nothing.

792
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
The game is over,game!The
thrill of my existance.

793
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I'm wandering in my life,

794
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
just like wandering in
the tragedies of Racine.

795
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Hermione verion man

796
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Where am I? What have I
done? What should I do?

797
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
What kind of passion has catched me?

798
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
What kind of sorrow licks me up?

799
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
"Can't I know whether I love or I hate?"

800
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Sophie murdered me,
butchered me, killed me.

801
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Raped me.

802
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
There are also many crazy feet.

803
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
And, I feel it incomplete at last.

804
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Bring me to the happy that never
experience since I was born.

805
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,993
Love, family, work, paraboloid attenna.

806
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Racine, I said.

807
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
The final one.

808
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Julien! The dustbin.

809
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,993
Julien, rubbish.

810
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,993
Julien! Kiss.

811
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Go, Julien, children.

812
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,993
Clic,clac,patati,patata!

813
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
What can this gift do? Silence.

814
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Don't say anything.

815
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
For the celebration
of our marriage memory.

816
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Do you know keeping secret?
The secrets of dinosaur?

817
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,993
The secrets of espionage?

818
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
The secrets of little figure?
Ok, please keep secret.

819
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Please hide this. This is for mother.

820
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
We will give it to her tonight.

821
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Mother.

822
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,993
Don't look what we hide for you.

823
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Nearly 35 years old, I won everything.

824
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
A wife, two children, three
brothers, four savings.

825
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
In the same box.

826
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
stay 6 years.

827
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
8 times every quarter.

828
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Coition, round Earth 9 times.

829
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Using the packing which can't be untied.

830
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Ten years...

831
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Haven't see my father.

832
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Happy.

833
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,993
The perfect despot's
whole arm I imagine.

834
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Like this. As an adult.

835
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,993
Have a calculater can show
210, but only reach 60.

836
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,991
Hello!

837
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,991
Hello!

838
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,993
About 40 times failure with father.

839
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Deceive the boss 96 times.

840
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Yes, yes, Dorzac, I come.

841
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
No, I come, I will come
at 10 whip and spur.

842
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
You have the meet in
advance. Don't care me.

843
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Monday's jam.

844
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,993
Now 97 times. See you later.

845
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Hello, Sophie! Dare. 123
times nightmare in it...

846
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,993
I become a despot finally.

847
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,993
No, No, I listen, yes, yes.

848
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,993
Yes, I will come soon. ok.

849
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
The city changed.

850
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,991
so does death.

851
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Dawdle away 489 hours in the base.

852
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I hope she will sing the
"auroral life" for me again.

853
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,993
Should believe that I don't need her.

854
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
We can say.

855
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Mother can fly because of this game.

856
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,993
There is much distance
from the original think.

857
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Sorry. Please show your project.

858
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Wait...They are here! Come.

859
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
hello, I am sorry, I am late.

860
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
The project is here. It has
been prepared for ten years.

861
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
6 months. Divide 20.

862
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
What did I say? 10 years!

863
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Sorry! It has been prepared
for 10 months...6 months!

864
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Day by day pasts, 10 years.

865
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
The bet ends today.

866
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,000
No news about her, even a little.

867
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
She forgot me.

868
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I don't.

869
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Watch her husband the whole day.

870
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
How can I forget her?

871
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
he became the nation's hero.

872
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,993
"Sexy Sergei", was chosen
by three women magzines.

873
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I never hate football like that.

874
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Hello, I am Sergei, I
will be a little later.

875
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,993
But I will come. What a buzy day.

876
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,993
Sorry, but this is my personal life.

877
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
How?

878
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,993
Yes...Listen, I don't know.

879
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,993
Is it the final edition?

880
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I don't know...I...Do you like it?

881
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Yes.

882
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I can imagine Sophie's life.

883
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
It isn't like this...Stupid.

884
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,991
Stupid.

885
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Yes, stupid...This snippet is stupid.

886
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
This is the working
meeting. I can't bear it...

887
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
The arrange bargain
is stupid. It's enough!

888
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Do you know who directed this snippet?

889
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Steffie Daniel.

890
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,993
It's stupid even the
pontiffs sign together.

891
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
This is not a game, Sophie.

892
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Sergei! Yes?

893
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,993
I have the right to defuse,
haven't I? Haven't I?

894
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,991
Yes, you have.

895
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,993
Then, how can I decide?

896
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,993
You decide this snippet is stupid.

897
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Wait, there is something on my back.

898
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
What is it? Your little black bear?

899
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,993
A little black bear, in
principle, not the puzzle dom.

900
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,993
Do you say good morning
to your wife recently?

901
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Not from yestoday, what about you?

902
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Do you say "I love you" to your husband?

903
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Not, even 100 years.

904
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I never say "duckbill" to you.

905
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I am thinking that i
should make up this neglect.

906
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,991
duckbill.

907
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
duckbill.

908
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
She really forgot me.

909
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,993
Do you go out tonight?

910
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I hate football. Dad, dare you?

911
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
This?

912
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
This? This?

913
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
This? This?

914
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
This? This?

915
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
This? This? This?

916
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Dare you make a girl
crying in her wedding?

917
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Dare you smile in the
unfortunate moment?

918
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,993
Dare you maintain dumbness 10 years?

919
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I just hang up the phone with Margaret.

920
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
About his insurance story.

921
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I only want to serve him.

922
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I have my office.

923
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
But doesn't signed "Army of Salut".

924
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Are you listening?

925
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Yes? No, not in this ten years.

926
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,991
No...

927
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,993
Do you know life ehind office?

928
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Are you worried about Dorzac?

929
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Watch me.

930
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
It's too far, you should marry Dorzac.

931
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Look what he brought to you.

932
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,993
Why are the musters of goods
sent here instead of the office?

933
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I lived 10 years with
the breath pausing.

934
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I feel like a dog...

935
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Leak on the carpet and
wait someone clobber me.

936
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
A Monday evening, it happened.

937
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,993
It made me crazy.

938
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
There is Julien and the children.

939
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Nice to see you.

940
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Are the children here?

941
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Yes, everyone is here.

942
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Look at who is coming.

943
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Sophie.

944
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Hello, Julien.

945
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,993
Hello, Clo, I am so happy.

946
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,993
I come back...

947
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,993
Dare or not, Sophie?

948
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
e-mail? Send it here, please.

949
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,993
And Clo is here,
Julien, I want you stay.

950
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,991
Sophie?

951
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,991
Sophie?

952
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,991
Are you OK?

953
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
The Police? I'm Madame Nimov Nemovietch.

954
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
The strange man come again.

955
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,993
I have ever tested once,
they use only 1 min.

956
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Oh, no.

957
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
That's my grandma's hangover.

958
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,991
I beg you.

959
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,993
Haven't seen for long
time, about 10 years.

960
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
He escaped from here.

961
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Sophie! You are playing game again.

962
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Pure happiness.

963
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Great!

964
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
It can cut down everything.

965
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Better than anaesthetic,cocain,high
purity cocain,reefer

966
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Indian hemp,LSD,hallucinogen

967
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Better than sex,blowjob,rave
party,complex sexual relationship

968
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Better than the butter on the peanuts.

969
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Better than Lucas,end of 2001

970
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
The dance of Marylin,and Schtroumpfette

971
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Better than Lara Croft

972
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Better than Jimmy
Hendrix,than Armstrong.

973
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Better than the
walk-around by Santa Claus

974
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Better than Bill Gates,then
the trances of Dalai-Lama.

975
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,993
Better than the collagen on
the lips of Pamela Anderson

976
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Better than the drugs
of Rimbaud, Morrison.

977
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Better than freedom

978
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,991
Better than life

979
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Hellow? Yes.

980
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
It's Hospital Saint-Antoine,May
I speak to Madame Janvier

981
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,000
It's her speaking. Your
husband had an accident.

982
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,993
It's my best friend,we've known
each other since elementary school

983
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
And you have never introduced him to me?

984
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,993
Have you introduced everyone
to me?You see them everyday.

985
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
You see him every day?

986
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Who's that guy?

987
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
If he was same as I think,I'll kill him.

988
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,993
He doesn't need you.

989
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,993
Are you okay,Madame Janvier?

990
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Speaking the truth,this time,

991
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I'm really angry at her.

992
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I want her to have a rough
time, then, I would forgive her.

993
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
We are smiling at the end.

994
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
After all, it's a game.

995
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,991
Go!

996
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,991
Sophie!

997
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Where have you been, Julien?
We are all looking for you.

998
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I went to the toilet.

999
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,993
-Are you alright?  
-I'm fine.

1000
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Whole night in the first-aid room.

1001
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,993
Is this your pleasantly surprised?

1002
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Do you suffer much pain ?

1003
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,000
No, nothing, never mind.

1004
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
What did you do?

1005
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I'm sorry.

1006
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,993
I don't know what's the trouble with me.

1007
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
All will be better.

1008
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I'm here.

1009
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
I even don't care the stealing.

1010
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I feel sorry for you.

1011
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,993
Damn!

1012
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Prepare the Atarax for me.

1013
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,993
That's all. It's the
sequelae of the bump.

1014
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
What did I do?

1015
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,991
Sophie!

1016
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,991
Julien?

1017
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Sophie,forgive me.

1018
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,991
Julien!

1019
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Oh! Idiot you are.

1020
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,991
Take me back to the hospital.

1021
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Take me back to the hospital.

1022
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,991
Sophie!

1023
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,991
Sophie!

1024
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,991
Sophie!

1025
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,993
Take the umbrella.

1026
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,991
You will be wringing.

1027
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,993
Dare you?

1028
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Julien! Look at me.

1029
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Say it!

1030
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,993
When she hold me in her breast.

1031
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
She susurrating everything.

1032
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I see the rose colored life.

1033
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
She tells love with me.

1034
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Children.

1035
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,991
Sophie, come back.

1036
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,991
Shut up!

1037
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
It's important to me.

1038
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I didn't remember the words clearly.

1039
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
It's will there. The only
method could make me stop...

1040
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
is a strong fist.

1041
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
So silly you are.

1042
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,993
Really silly.

1043
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,991
Julien?

1044
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,991
Julien?

1045
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,991
It's enough, wake up.

1046
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Don't leave me alone.

1047
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,993
Wake up, wake, Prithee!

1048
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,993
Come back! Prithee! Back

1049
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,993
Don't leave me alone.

1050
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,993
No, it's too easy for you.

1051
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,991
Come, look for it.

1052
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,991
Dare you?

1053
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,991
Dare you?

1054
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Julien!

1055
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Do you hear me? I know you do.

1056
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Dare you come back?

1057
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,993
Julien, I do!

1058
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,991
Come on.

1059
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,991
The last game.

1060
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,993
We won't left each other, never.

1061
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,000
To win the game, we must
have a beautiful box.

1062
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
And a pretty friend.

1063
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,993
And any other never mind.

1064
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,000
There're somethings I would dare
to do, even if you didn't say.

1065
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
For example?

1066
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Eat ants.

1067
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Abuse the unemployed men of ANPE.

1068
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,993
Love you like a bedlamite.

1069
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Look! We win it like this.

1070
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Together, happy.

1071
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,993
Finally at the bottom of the concrete,
we share our dream in childhood.

1072
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,993
A love dream with no final.

1073
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
"B"

1074
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
"B"

1075
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Braquemart or bite.

1076
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Never mind.

1077
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Or bralder, what dou you write?

1078
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Write, I have never.

1079
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Anything else?

1080
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Bander, do you know it?

1081
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
What about you?

1082
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Take it back?

1083
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
How about your children?
Do you consider about them?

1084
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,993
Then what would they think about?

1085
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
You take an orange colored.

1086
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
I want an orange
colored, do you like blue?

1087
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Because there's only one blue colored.

1088
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Give you a blue, you are so cute.

1089
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
And give you another blue.

1090
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,991
OK?

1091
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,991
I love you.

1092
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,993
Sophie, my best friend.

1093
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,991
End.
