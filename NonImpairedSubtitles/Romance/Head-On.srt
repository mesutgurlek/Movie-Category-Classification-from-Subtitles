1
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:12,962
I go for a walk along the creek,

2
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:19,001
watch the fishes
in the bleak water.

3
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:23,247
I am sad because of you,

4
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:26,920
my dear Saniye
with the waving hair.

5
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:32,038
I am sad because there’s no
love in your eyes.

6
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,927
I am sad because of you,

7
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:40,526
my dear Saniye
with the waving hair.

8
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:45,798
I am sad because there’s no
love in your eyes.

9
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,646
Cahit, are you fine?

10
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,558
Do you want to drink something, Seref?

11
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:25,328
Yes, coke.

12
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:30,559
Give me another beer.

13
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:34,964
You are thirsty today, right?

14
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:41,681
Yes, pal.

15
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:44,282
Why don’t you drink water then?

16
00:02:45,369 --> 00:02:48,679
I’m not an animal.

17
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:26,961
How was the concert?

18
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:35,282
Piss off, Maren.

19
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:37,524
Asshole!

20
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:41,360
Fuck you!
- Motherfucker!

21
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:47,878
Hey you!

22
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:53,368
Hey tramp!
Hey, I'm talking to you!

23
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:55,487
Such a hot chick

24
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:57,726
and you drive her off?

25
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,040
Are you a queer?

26
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:04,760
Seems that you are gay- ...

27
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:23,518
Are you fucking insane?

28
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,084
Piss off Cahit! Go home!

29
00:04:26,489 --> 00:04:29,765
Stop that bullshit!
Go home!

30
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,000
Go home now!

31
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:50,684
My bitch brought me here.

32
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:53,847
She said to Schiller that
she was afraid of her husband.

33
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:57,406
What am I?

34
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:01,882
"I'm afraid of my husband!"
She's so false!

35
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:05,361
But I know the right people.
I will take it out of her.

36
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:09,119
What kind of people?
- Security guys.

37
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,598
I'll get her down.
She doesn't know what she's up to?

38
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,525
Last time I was here too.
- You were 13 too ...

39
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,641
Cahit Tomruk please.

40
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:48,809
There are thousands of ways to kill yourself?
Why do you drive against a wall?

41
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:55,080
Who said that I wanted to kill myself?

42
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,041
There's no skid mark.

43
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:07,129
You are not allowed to
smoke here, Mister Tomruk.

44
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:17,882
Where does the name Tomruk come from?
- From Turkey.

45
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:20,121
I mean what does it mean?

46
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:24,558
No idea...
- The names always have such a nice meaning.

47
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:26,004
Really?

48
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:30,561
Yes. Much more as our names here have .
At least for the first names I know it for sure.

49
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:40,479
If you want to bring your life to an end just do it.
But you don't have to die that for.

50
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:45,603
Bring you life to an end
and move away.

51
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:48,760
Do something useful.

52
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:50,926
Do something.

53
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:53,439
Go to Africa.
Help people.

54
00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:00,928
Do you know a band called "The The"?

55
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,843
Pardon?

56
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:08,527
They have a song
"If you can't change the world, change your world"

57
00:08:08,929 --> 00:08:12,808
You want me to bring you the record?
- Got it already.

58
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:20,605
Am I allowed to say something Doc?

59
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:24,320
You are nuts?

60
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,522
Are you Turk?
Would you marry me?

61
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:39,608
What?
Would you marry me?

62
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:42,727
Piss off!

63
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:50,239
Nice to meet you,
Cahit Tomruk.

64
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:55,005
Cahit Tomruk... Sibel Tomruk...

65
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:07,203
Excuse me,
are you looking for something?

66
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:10,567
A beer.

67
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:15,047
Sorry we don't have beer.
But you can have a coffee.

68
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:22,242
The shame that you have brought
on us is inexcusable.

69
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:26,724
The biggest gift
for a human being is life.

70
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:30,878
There is no bigger gift
then life.

71
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:36,887
Who do you think you are that
you throw this gift away so easily?

72
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:42,886
You can be glad,
that you are still alive.

73
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:51,720
Do you have the key, Yilmaz?

74
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:55,522
See you later...

75
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:04,157
Can't you see what you do to him?

76
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,247
He perishes.

77
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:10,322
Look at me!

78
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:12,278
Look at me!

79
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:16,321
If something happens to dad I kill you.

80
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:35,962
Give me one too.

81
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:43,961
There’s no sense in suicide.

82
00:10:45,489 --> 00:10:50,358
The only thing you achieve
is to make us and you sad.

83
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:51,917
Do not forget that.

84
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:54,365
I thought that they let me be!

85
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:59,160
Let you be? Couldn't I teach
you anything!

86
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:01,321
Don't say that mother.

87
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:05,921
Oh, Sibel...

88
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:10,766
How long are you going to stay here?
- I don't know.

89
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:15,357
Don't panic with all this
lunatics in here!

90
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:30,801
You don't die like this.
- How don't you die?

91
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:33,200
Perpendicular.
- What perpendicular?

92
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,042
You have to cut perpendicular.

93
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:40,767
Perpendicular sux.
- I see

94
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:49,486
Can you get me a beer?

95
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:51,686
If you marry me?

96
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:56,437
I only fuck men.
- Really?

97
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:05,284
You know what? I'll get you a beer.

98
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:08,524
Tonight at midnight in front
of the hospital. Ok?

99
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:37,800
Where's my beer?
- Follow me.

100
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:42,639
Where in Turkey do you come from?
- Mersin

101
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:46,285
I was told Mersin is beautiful.
- Yeah I know I'm born there.

102
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:50,005
We come from Zonguldak.
You know Zonguldak?

103
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:53,039
Why do you want to die?

104
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:00,805
I asked you something.

105
00:13:05,729 --> 00:13:07,208
Do you like my nose?

106
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:11,242
Touch it.

107
00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:24,759
My brother broke it because he
saw me holding someone's hand.

108
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:28,048
And now touch my tits.

109
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:33,524
Have you ever seen so hot tits?

110
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:37,528
I wanna live Cahit. I wanna live
I wanna dance I wanna fuck

111
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:40,568
not only with one guy.
Do you understand?

112
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,322
I'm not deaf!

113
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:46,367
Bullshit!

114
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:53,001
Do you marry me now Cahit?
- Forget it!

115
00:13:57,929 --> 00:13:58,805
Shit!

116
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:08,247
Are you fucking crazy girl?

117
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:12,397
That's not a game!
We pretend to be married.

118
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:14,447
Do you understand?
- No I don't!

119
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:19,244
That's just an excuse for my parents
so that I don't have to live at home.

120
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:23,005
Ok we live together but
I promise I'm a good roommate.

121
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:26,845
I go shopping, cook, tidy up
the rooms, clean the restroom.

122
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:31,447
We have separate rooms, we don't fuck, we don't have anything together.
- And your parents?

123
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:34,647
They are just your parents-in-law.
You don't have a close relationship.

124
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:37,643
Relationship? We don't have a relationship at all?

125
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:40,648
From time to time they come
to our place and we come to theirs.

126
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:45,685
And then we pretend to be wife and
husband or how did you imagine this?

127
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:48,126
Why me?

128
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:54,203
Because my parents would
accept you. You are Turk.

129
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:06,008
What's going on?

130
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:06,719
Get off!

131
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:08,157
Why?

132
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:09,322
l said: Get off!

133
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:10,724
Why?

134
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:13,080
Because in my bus.

135
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:17,163
There is no space for godless
dogs like you guys!

136
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:18,842
Get off, you too!

137
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:22,009
What's going on?

138
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:24,325
That's not even your bus.
It belongs to the city council.

139
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:25,479
Piss off!

140
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:33,361
Hey wait!

141
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:35,887
What’s your name?

142
00:15:53,609 --> 00:15:57,397
She has a window to the street.

143
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:05,197
Her admirers throw little
stones on her windows.

144
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:13,202
My dear is the one
with the most beautiful eyebrows.

145
00:16:16,969 --> 00:16:20,518
Look for a lover too

146
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:24,478
and sum up your bride money.

147
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,644
Tell me, are you completely insane?

148
00:18:01,889 --> 00:18:06,280
Are you an actrice?
Do you want an Oscar?

149
00:18:07,329 --> 00:18:11,561
You do not understand that:
She is in troubles.

150
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:13,488
That's non of your business

151
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:18,121
I don't know?
Otherwise she wants to kill herself.

152
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:21,726
Bullshit!
As if that would be so easy.

153
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:24,005
That's women!

154
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:27,446
In order to soft-soap you,
they tell stories.

155
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,487
Do you know what it means to get married?
- No, I don't know.

156
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:32,362
Problems!

157
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:34,327
Look at me. Am I married?

158
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:37,965
No. I don't owe anyone anything
and I live in peace.

159
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:40,484
You lie. You got married!

160
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:44,000
That's different.
That was in order to stay here.

161
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,008
Basically that's the same.

162
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:50,199
Then get married,
for gods sake!

163
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:54,488
God blesses you! I'll be at
the wedding and dance with you.

164
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:07,482
One more thing...
- What?

165
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:15,799
Birsen?
- What?

166
00:19:16,209 --> 00:19:20,680
Do you know this guy?
- No, but our daughter knows him.

167
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:22,761
She knows him then.

168
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:26,400
How can you give our daughter
to a foreigner?

169
00:19:27,689 --> 00:19:31,967
She made many mistakes.
Maybe it becomes better now.

170
00:19:32,449 --> 00:19:35,680
She made mistakes,
because you spoiled her like that.

171
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:37,920
Since she was a little child!

172
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:42,561
When do they come?
- Whether you want or not: Tomorrow.

173
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:45,481
Tomorrow already?

174
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:49,004
They are supposed to come,
for gods sake!

175
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:55,682
You only get us into trouble!

176
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,726
From which city
do we come once again?

177
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:01,925
From Mersin.

178
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:06,240
Not Malatya?
- No, man. It was Mersin.

179
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:08,081
Fuck your Mersin.

180
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:11,162
Friends, what's wrong with you?

181
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:14,238
That's not you fucking business!

182
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:19,001
Do you have to yell like this?
- Hurry, I'm queued too.

183
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:22,366
Just a second.
- How do you talk with me?

184
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:25,123
Sorry. Never mind.

185
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:26,683
Ok.

186
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:33,443
There is no alcohol
in the chocolates, right?

187
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:35,367
No.
- Sure?

188
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:37,845
Do you wanna bullshit me?

189
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:42,367
Really? - Holy shit,
there's no alcohol in there!

190
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:45,881
Fuck your alcohol!
With alcohol they are too expensive anyway.

191
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:49,081
Don't yell at me!
That was just a question!

192
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:53,004
You ask 100 times the same shit!

193
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:55,365
Which house number?
- 8.

194
00:20:55,609 --> 00:20:57,998
How does you hair look like?
- That's new fashion.

195
00:20:58,249 --> 00:21:01,525
That is a proposal and
you look like a fag!

196
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:04,727
They wont give you their daughter like this!

197
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:08,723
What was the name once again?
- Güner.

198
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:18,921
So you are the uncle of Cahit?

199
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:23,763
Yes... That means,
I'm his youngest uncle.

200
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:27,198
How many siblings are you then?

201
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:33,522
Ehm... just a second... we are a lot...

202
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:35,481
Seven.
- Yes, seven.

203
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:37,958
Respect!

204
00:21:38,889 --> 00:21:40,959
You are your nephew all over.

205
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:47,244
May be.

206
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:48,803
Where do your parents live?

207
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:54,521
My parents are... dead.

208
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:58,088
My condolence.

209
00:21:58,369 --> 00:21:59,688
Thanks.

210
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:03,681
Do you have any siblings?

211
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:08,485
Yes,
I have a sister in Frankfurt.

212
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:10,684
Don't you see each other?

213
00:22:11,489 --> 00:22:14,799
Yeah...once in a while.

214
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:17,443
You don't have a proper Turkish!
What happened?

215
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:20,243
I dumped it.

216
00:22:22,449 --> 00:22:24,679
That was a joke!

217
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:29,877
Is there any alcohol in
the chocolates?

218
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:32,768
No, no! Of course not.

219
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:40,608
Where do you come from?

220
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:43,439
From Malatya.

221
00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:45,328
From Mersin.

222
00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:49,801
That's because, a part of the family comes
from Mersin, the other part from Malatya.

223
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:53,527
They moved from Mersin
to Malatya...

224
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:56,363
What a scattered family!
- Yes, exactly!

225
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:06,127
Thank you.
- l hope it tasted good.

226
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:13,321
Where did you meet my sister?

227
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:19,078
I work in the hospital.

228
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:25,368
Cahit visits me there from time to time...
like two or three times a week...

229
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:29,086
Once he visited me and saw Sibel.

230
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:33,040
Well and then we decided to buy chocolate.

231
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:39,763
You are the manager of a factory?
- Yes.

232
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:44,685
Actually I'm the manager of 'the' factory.

233
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:47,685
That's an event and culture location in Altona.

234
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:51,047
I'm the boss there.
- I will come and visit you.

235
00:23:51,449 --> 00:23:52,484
Yes you are welcome.

236
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:56,402
Isn't he a little bit too old for you?

237
00:23:57,249 --> 00:23:58,921
I like him.

238
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,601
Couldn't you find a better one?

239
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:15,922
We ate and drank.
Thanks a lot. - You're welcome.

240
00:24:17,449 --> 00:24:19,007
Let's get to the main topic.

241
00:24:20,449 --> 00:24:21,768
We came,

242
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:26,922
with God's permission

243
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:30,441
for my nephew Cahit

244
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:34,089
to ask you for the hand of your daughter.

245
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:41,281
Sibel!

246
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,604
Yes, father...

247
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:48,967
Did you decide?

248
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:54,761
Yes, father.

249
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,887
What can we do?

250
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:09,805
When two young people agree

251
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:12,285
and like each other.

252
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:15,646
What shall we say?

253
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:21,646
God bless you.
- Thank you.

254
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:25,202
Cahit, kiss your father's hand.

255
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:32,319
Thanks.

256
00:25:50,969 --> 00:25:52,846
I'm coming already!

257
00:25:55,009 --> 00:25:58,479
Are you crazy?
- Hi Cahit.

258
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:13,920
Do you have coffee?

259
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:16,320
The coffee machine is gone.

260
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:22,121
Tell me, a Turkish mariage
costs a shitload of money, right?

261
00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:24,679
Who is going to pay that?
- I got the money.

262
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:29,605
Where from? - I always knew that one day I will
run away from home. So I saved money.

263
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:32,159
Damn, why didn't you do it?

264
00:26:33,249 --> 00:26:35,843
Because of my mother.
- Oh yea.

265
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:40,843
Is your sister going to come?
- No.

266
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:43,484
Why? - That's none of your fucking business.

267
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:49,086
Who is your witness to a marriage?
Your brother?

268
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:53,482
My cousin Selma from Istanbul.
She's hot you know ... - I don't fucking care

269
00:26:53,889 --> 00:26:56,323
And she brings a pack of Turks with her?

270
00:26:56,729 --> 00:26:58,765
No, she comes alone. She is divorced.

271
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:02,321
To get rid of me we could do the same thing.
- Good idea.

272
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:14,927
Here you are! - What's that?
- I guessed so I don't know if it fits.

273
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:19,724
You guessed right.

274
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:35,925
I missed you!
- How was your flight?

275
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:38,240
They searched me again for drugs.

276
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:41,128
Where is my brother-in-law?
- He's busy...

277
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:45,248
Let me have a look. Your ass became nice.

278
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:48,242
Where did you meet?

279
00:27:48,489 --> 00:27:51,083
That's a long story.
- Tell...

280
00:27:51,329 --> 00:27:53,638
Where should I begin?
- At the beginning.

281
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:16,607
Selma.
- Cahit.

282
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,882
Take care of them.

283
00:28:28,449 --> 00:28:31,441
Thanks. - What shall I do now?
Kiss you? - Later

284
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:32,964
What?
- Later.

285
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:40,479
Sibel Güner,
Born on June 16th in Hamburg,

286
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:43,488
marital status single, German citizenship.

287
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:45,965
Is that correct?
- Yes.

288
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:50,806
Cahit Tomruk, born on August 25th 1960 in Mersin
Turkey,

289
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:55,043
Marital status widowed, German citizenship.
Is that correct?

290
00:28:56,449 --> 00:28:59,361
Yes that is correct.
- Then you can go for the wedding ceremony.

291
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:01,122
How did you wife die?

292
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:04,568
Cahit!
- Shut the fuck up! Am I clear?

293
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:07,444
What's going on?
- I didn't understand.

294
00:29:07,689 --> 00:29:10,123
Don't you speak German?
- Yes I Do.

295
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:17,084
We meet here to celebrate the wedding

296
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:19,919
of Sibel and Cahit.

297
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:23,206
Welcome.
Let's ask the couple

298
00:29:23,449 --> 00:29:26,122
with your applause
to the dance floor!

299
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:36,041
Cahit we have to dance.
- I don't dance.

300
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:42,207
But we have to!
- No we don't, ok?

301
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:44,798
Please Cahit.

302
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:46,606
l beg you.

303
00:29:47,609 --> 00:29:50,203
Cahit the people are looking!

304
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:58,719
You German slut.
- Yes that's me.

305
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:38,557
What's that.
- That's your room.

306
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:44,082
You are going to eat here.
- Allright.

307
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:50,447
I pick you up in half an hour.
- Allright brother.

308
00:31:05,729 --> 00:31:07,208
You want as well?

309
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:09,558
Yes.

310
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:53,680
Don't you wanna carry me into the room?

311
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:56,568
Hoppaa!

313
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:15,527
May I ask you a question?
- yea sure.

314
00:32:19,889 --> 00:32:21,561
How was your wife called?

315
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:25,487
What's up?

316
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:29,479
Get lost!

317
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:33,086
Piss off now!

318
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:41,244
Katharina.

319
00:32:51,049 --> 00:32:54,280
Get me another one.
- Actually I wanted to close down now.

320
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:57,042
Already?

321
00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:00,003
Well everything has to come to an end?

322
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,964
Do you know where I can sleep tonight?

323
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:29,042
How about your husband?

324
00:33:29,449 --> 00:33:32,919
He drove me off.
- Super...

325
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:47,520
Well if you want...

326
00:33:48,649 --> 00:33:50,401
You can sleep at my place.

327
00:33:53,889 --> 00:33:55,083
But only if you want.

328
00:33:57,129 --> 00:33:59,359
Are you aware that you steal a bride?

329
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:22,919
You mustn't get married,
there are so many alternatives.

330
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:25,241
Tell me one.

331
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:29,406
You could have studied.
in of another city.

332
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:33,478
As if I would have school-leaving examination... - you would have
being able to marry someone else.

333
00:35:33,729 --> 00:35:35,526
Not such a tramp!

334
00:35:35,889 --> 00:35:40,201
I'm too young to become married
seriously and to become housewife!

335
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:42,768
Come to me.

336
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:45,688
To Istanbul.

337
00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:11,288
Oh my god that's a girlie room.

338
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:12,804
That's incredible.

339
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:15,325
I cut off your cock soon!

340
00:36:16,209 --> 00:36:18,359
What did all this cost?

341
00:36:19,529 --> 00:36:21,406
Enough to go bankrupt.

342
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:26,687
And who pays the rent?
- I don't know.

343
00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:29,598
I wont pay your part.

344
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:37,409
Could you finally stop moving?

345
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:43,208
Let, ...

346
00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:45,725
Do you want to make a model out of me.

347
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:00,519
Fine.

348
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:02,044
Done.

349
00:37:05,529 --> 00:37:06,678
Take a shower.

350
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:25,720
Can I help you, Maren?

351
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:42,680
Are you in a good or in a bad mood?

352
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:46,128
Both.

353
00:37:54,529 --> 00:37:55,723
Thanks.

354
00:37:56,089 --> 00:37:57,044
You're welcome.

355
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:51,641
Who cut them?

356
00:38:54,169 --> 00:38:56,046
My roommate.

357
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:58,764
Since when do you have a roommate?

358
00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:04,848
Since a couple of days.

359
00:39:05,249 --> 00:39:07,160
Do you fuck?
- No.

360
00:39:07,569 --> 00:39:09,878
What?
- No.

361
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:14,122
Is she nice?

362
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:21,166
she needs a job.

363
00:39:36,889 --> 00:39:38,766
Hi I'm Sibel.

364
00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:44,241
You're Cahit's flat mate right?
- Yes.

365
00:39:45,729 --> 00:39:48,960
You're looking for a job?
- Yes, I'm I a good hair stylist.

366
00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:51,243
Well then...

367
00:39:51,649 --> 00:39:55,483
Hello, I've got an appointment for 11 o'clock.
- yes, take a seat.

368
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:59,287
Do you want?
- Yes.

369
00:40:01,929 --> 00:40:05,399
Is it ok if she does it?
- Sure no problem.

370
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:07,925
Thanks. How do you like it?

371
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:11,008
Just cut the ends.
- Ok.

372
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:15,362
Shall I wash them?
- No, I just did and they are still wet.

373
00:40:42,249 --> 00:40:45,241
That looks hot right!
- Yeah, yeah!

374
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,840
Next thing is a tattoo!
Such a huge one!

375
00:40:49,249 --> 00:40:50,204
Yeah!

376
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:55,405
Maren is a hot chick!
- Yes!

377
00:40:55,809 --> 00:40:59,040
She has a hot ass?
- Yeah I think so too!

378
00:40:59,409 --> 00:41:01,923
She has a really hot ass.

379
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:10,487
Do you like my piercing?
- yes!

380
00:41:11,129 --> 00:41:13,484
Yes it is hot, really hot!

381
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:17,359
Do you want to go dancing with me.
- Yea sure.

382
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:19,566
I want to show off with you.

383
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:23,644
But I say at whom ok?

384
00:41:24,009 --> 00:41:25,488
Ok!

385
00:42:37,729 --> 00:42:39,481
Cahit, I go to fuck!

386
00:42:41,049 --> 00:42:42,880
Did you see the guy?

387
00:45:56,769 --> 00:45:59,806
How many heads did you wash
to afford this car?

388
00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:03,042
Yilmaz has connections. He gets it cheaper.

389
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:06,963
Do I really have to join you?
Bullshit!

390
00:46:07,329 --> 00:46:10,605
We are married for half a year now
and we have never been there.

391
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:14,757
I don't wanna, I don’t wanna!
- Oh please Cahit!

392
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:17,600
Fuck your 'oh please'.

393
00:46:17,529 --> 00:46:20,282
Your Turkish really improves!

394
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:27,165
It's your turn, play!

395
00:46:27,729 --> 00:46:30,527
Whether take this or this!

396
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:27,165
It's your turn
- Yea brother I play!

397
00:46:31,209 --> 00:46:34,724
How could you give your girl to him?

398
00:46:34,969 --> 00:46:38,041
Do not interfere in ours
family affairs!

399
00:46:38,649 --> 00:46:42,278
Hey guys. Last week I was at the "Pasha"
A very nice club. Everything available there.

400
00:46:42,649 --> 00:46:45,038
Scandinavian, African ...

401
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:48,202
Turkish? - My cellar is full of Turks.

402
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:52,439
Play brother.

403
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:55,522
You have to come with us!

404
00:46:53,129 --> 00:46:54,448
Brother-in-law!

405
00:46:57,129 --> 00:46:58,403
Where to?

406
00:46:58,809 --> 00:46:59,878
To a Brothel.

407
00:47:01,289 --> 00:47:02,324
What shall I do in a brothel?

408
00:47:03,569 --> 00:47:05,241
What a question!

409
00:47:05,729 --> 00:47:07,606
Do you know the brother
of Michael Jackson ?

410
00:47:09,249 --> 00:47:11,319
Siki Ceksin
(you will fuck)

411
00:47:15,129 --> 00:47:17,882
Why don't you fuck your own wives?

412
00:47:26,169 --> 00:47:27,727
What did you say?

413
00:47:30,649 --> 00:47:35,245
Why you don't fuck your own wives?
It's your turn.

414
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:42,527
Do not ever say the word 'fuck'
together with our wives again!

415
00:47:44,249 --> 00:47:46,399
Did you understand me?
- What?

416
00:47:46,769 --> 00:47:49,841
As much as you understood me?
- Calm down.

417
00:47:51,649 --> 00:47:55,085
Galatasaray becomes master.

418
00:48:09,369 --> 00:48:12,839
What the fuck?
I kick you in the ass!

419
00:48:13,209 --> 00:48:15,006
I fucking hit you!
- Calm down!

420
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:22,567
And how is your husband like?

421
00:48:23,489 --> 00:48:24,478
Very sweet.

422
00:48:25,249 --> 00:48:26,284
And in bed?

423
00:48:28,249 --> 00:48:29,204
Okay.

424
00:48:30,009 --> 00:48:31,283
Does he suck?

425
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:35,567
Like a cat.

426
00:48:35,929 --> 00:48:37,044
You can be glad!

427
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:42,483
Mine sux like an ox
and sometimes he moos.

428
00:48:50,169 --> 00:48:52,683
Hey wait a second.

429
00:48:55,129 --> 00:48:57,438
I was at the factory.

430
00:48:57,849 --> 00:49:01,159
You are not the manager there ...

431
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:04,208
you just clean the tables.

432
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:06,760
Why did you lie?

433
00:49:09,169 --> 00:49:11,763
Imagine if you were me.

434
00:49:12,689 --> 00:49:14,680
You clean the fucking tables.

435
00:49:17,529 --> 00:49:19,918
Would you have given me your sister?

436
00:49:23,969 --> 00:49:25,482
Do you love her?

437
00:49:28,529 --> 00:49:29,484
Yes.

438
00:49:31,089 --> 00:49:32,488
I love her.

439
00:49:47,729 --> 00:49:49,879
Can I get another beer please?

440
00:49:50,289 --> 00:49:54,077
Make it two.

441
00:49:54,489 --> 00:49:58,243
And I'm looking at him and
ask what’s going on

442
00:49:58,609 --> 00:50:02,568
because he has totally
cauterized eyebrows.

443
00:50:02,969 --> 00:50:07,042
he said he's lovesick

444
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:12,167
Do you want one more?
- No, thanks.

445
00:50:19,169 --> 00:50:22,127
I could tell you some nice stories.

446
00:50:22,489 --> 00:50:24,798
Really?
- Yes. - I'd love to.

447
00:50:25,209 --> 00:50:28,838
At my place...

448
00:50:29,209 --> 00:50:33,248
Do you live nearby?
-Yes around the corner.

449
00:50:43,329 --> 00:50:44,284
Hey!

450
00:51:15,849 --> 00:51:19,046
You do one mistake after another!

451
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,081
You are fine right.

452
00:51:23,769 --> 00:51:25,725
Why?

453
00:51:26,089 --> 00:51:27,807
You fuck better.

454
00:53:05,009 --> 00:53:07,364
It wasn't a bad idea to marry you.

455
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:10,800
I learned it from my mother.

456
00:53:20,089 --> 00:53:23,684
Ah... My mother asked me
about children today.

457
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:33,360
Let's make some.

458
00:53:36,089 --> 00:53:39,286
If it's getting too worse I tell
here you are infertile.

459
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:42,559
That's a good divorce reason.

460
00:53:45,209 --> 00:53:47,359
Do you want to go at the "Taksim" tonight?

461
00:54:31,529 --> 00:54:32,484
Hello.

462
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,600
A whiskey please.

463
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:50,808
What's that?

464
00:54:54,569 --> 00:54:55,524
Thanks.

465
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:08,561
Did you see her?
- whom?

466
00:55:08,929 --> 00:55:10,203
My wife.

467
00:55:12,569 --> 00:55:15,288
That little girl is your wife?
- Yes, and?

468
00:55:18,729 --> 00:55:20,048
Why do you look like this?

469
00:55:20,569 --> 00:55:22,161
I thought you don't fuck.

470
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:25,887
We don't fuck.

471
00:55:31,609 --> 00:55:34,362
Why don't you fuck
if you are married?

472
00:56:01,209 --> 00:56:03,848
I want to get in.

473
00:56:04,249 --> 00:56:08,800
Sorry but without girl you can't enter.
- My wife is in there.

474
00:56:09,169 --> 00:56:11,967
I don't give a fuck.
- You don't? - Yea.

475
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,759
Fuck you!
- Hey, fuck you. - No, no.

476
00:56:15,529 --> 00:56:16,803
Hold on.

477
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:18,443
That's my husband.

478
00:56:18,849 --> 00:56:21,761
Ok, that's your husband.

479
00:56:21,889 --> 00:56:24,084
But calm down.

480
00:56:24,449 --> 00:56:27,202
Don't make a riot in there.
- ok.

481
00:56:28,169 --> 00:56:30,160
It's ok guys.

482
00:56:30,569 --> 00:56:31,524
Peace!

483
00:56:40,209 --> 00:56:41,164
Sibel!

484
00:56:46,849 --> 00:56:50,683
I'm sorry that I ran away.

485
00:56:51,969 --> 00:56:53,721
It's ok.

486
00:56:54,129 --> 00:56:56,040
I've gone crazy?

487
00:56:56,969 --> 00:56:58,368
Everybody does.

488
00:57:31,569 --> 00:57:35,608
Hey babe. Are you all right?
