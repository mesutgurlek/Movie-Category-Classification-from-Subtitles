00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,365
You're serious about this?

317
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,171
I think sex is a serious matter.

318
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,800
It's one of the most persistent themes
in the Bible.

319
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,884
So...

320
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,646
...is it possible for me
to know a woman...

321
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,929
...in the Biblical sense, so to speak?

322
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,050
And...

323
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,442
And do I want to find out?

324
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,570
You want my opinion?

325
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,290
Please.

326
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,848
In my heart, I feel like he'll give you
a free pass on this one.

327
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,844
Go for it.
Huh?

328
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,161
Go for it.

329
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,129
Really?
Yes.

330
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,647
If you feel up to it. Do you feel up to it?

331
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,968
To tell you the truth...

332
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,800
...I'm scared.

333
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,246
Well, then, we should pray.

00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,010
...Mark and I sit at your feet...

336
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,451
...and pray that you bless
this little journey.

337
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,207
This one small step for a man.

338
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,361
I really feel proud of myself.

339

Imposing on someone I hardly know
to fornicate in their home.

340
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,206
Get over it.

341
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,488
It's perfectly normal.

The limit is six, but that gives us

Six.

would give anything for a natural erection?

What's it like to be a poet?

465

It's a way of living inside your own head,

some basic questions, okay?

470
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,803
Sure. Explain to me, so
that I really understand...

471
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,406
...exactly what the iron lung is for.

472

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,246
...but I work and sleep in the iron lung.

476
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,644
And how do you feel right now?

477
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,211
Out of my league.

478
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,486
(CHUCKLES)

479
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,201
I meant your breathing.
Oh, fine.

480
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,966
In fact, better than usual.
That's great.

481
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,366
Shall we get undressed?

482
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,046
Sure.

483
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,168
So it's good for me...
Be careful.

484
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,570
Did that hurt?

485
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,125
Not yet.

486
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,891
Do you have any areas
of unusual sensitivity?

487
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,566
Any parts of your body
you don't want me to touch?

488
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,405
I have normal sensitivity all over.

489
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,805
I'm not paralyzed exactly.
It's just my muscles don't work too good.

490
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,884
But you could touch me anywhere.

491
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,890
That's great.

492
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,247
Ow! Ow!

493
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,563
Stop! It hurts! It hurts! Holy Mother of God.
What...? What's wrong?

494
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,927
Ahh! My fingers are caught.
It's okay. It's okay.

495
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,766
I've got it. I've got you. Don't worry.
Be careful, please.

496
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:57,083
Mark, I'm gonna be really careful
with you.

497
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,164
I don't want to hurt you or injure you
in any way.

498
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,287
And it's really not sexy when
you yell at me. Okay?

499
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,890
I won't yell at you any more.

500
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,010
But you'll tell me, calmly...

501
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,248
...the minute something starts to hurt.

502
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,291
Yes.

503
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,124
Okay.

504
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,925
Here we go.

505
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,444
Piece of cake. Heh.

506
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,924
Nice shirt.
You already said that.

507
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,566
Did I?

508
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,651
Okay.

509
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,401
I'm gonna slide these down.
Be careful with my feet, okay? My feet.

510
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,210
Be careful.
Hold your breath.

511
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,771
Okay. Whoa. There you go.

512
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,325
Careful. Not so fast.

513
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,368
(WATER RUNNING)

514
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,204
You ready?

515
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,926
Whoa.

516
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,001
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

517
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,683
So the difference between me
and a prostitute...

518
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,047
...is a prostitute
wants your return business.

519
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,326
I don't.

520
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,211
I'm here to help you
learn about your sexual feelings...

521
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,522
...so you can share them
with a future partner.

522
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,328
Mark, I want you to tell me how it feels each
time I touch a different part of your body.

523
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,370
Okay?
You know, whenever I'm naked...

524
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,925
...everyone else in the room
is always dressed.

525
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,163
Now that I'm in bed with
another naked person, it's very confusing.

526
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,125
Why is it confusing?

527
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,802
I'd always expected that God
or my parents would intervene...

528
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,681
...to keep this moment from ever happening.
Not this time.

529
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,321
So if something feels good,
you tell me.

530
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,563
If something is ticklish or bothers you,
I want you to let me know.

531
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,929
I don't want you to tolerate anything.
Okay.

532
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,686
I'm gonna start with the top
of your head.

533
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,770
You have soft hair.

534
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,762
It's really nice to touch.

535
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,003
Does it feel good?
It does.

536
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,530
That feels weird.

537
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,611
Weird good or weird bad?

538
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,690
Just weird.

539
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,250
That's good.

540
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,243
Still good?
Everything good so far except the ear.

541
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,967
Are these the body awareness
exercises?

542
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,091
You're very clever to have worked that out.
People tell me I'm very perceptive.

543
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,968
Mark, would you like to
see what I feel like?

544
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,965
Sure.

545
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,042
You touch one, you have to touch the other.
It's sort of a rule.

546
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,165
That's a good rule.
Are you wearing cologne?

547
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,245
Yes.
I like it.

548
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,085
I don't usually like cologne,
but I like that.

549
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,528
So, Mark, I'm gonna move my hand
along your body...

550
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,567
...down to your penis, and
if you feel me... Ooh!

551
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,926
(MOANS)

552
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,041
Oh.
Nice job.

553
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,646
I thought there would be more to it.

554
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,247
Not that it was unpleasant.

555
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,961
After all, I was in bed with a naked woman.

556
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,011
She complimented me on my shirt,
my hair.

557
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,367
She held my penis.

558
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,487
I haven't even seen my penis
for over 30 years.

559
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,568
Am I sharing too much, Father?

560
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,121
No, no. I'm used to it.

561
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,890
So next week.

562
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,725
Friday the 20th, same time?

563
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,325
That's good for me.

564
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,687
Next time, we'll start to work
on intercourse.

565
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,245
Were you afraid at the thought of seeing me?
Oh, God, I was terrified.

566
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,887
You should be proud of yourself.
You did great. We've made real progress.

567
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,930
Can I ask you something?
Sure. What would you like to ask?

568
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,730
Anything, really.

569
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,360
Just tell me something about yourself.

570
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,086
Anything.
Okay.

571
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,847
Um... I'm a very private person.
I have a private life.

572
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,163
I need you to be aware of that.
But that's about it.

573
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,521
This therapy's about you.

574
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,286
VERA: Hello.
Welcome back.

575
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,290
CHERYL: Perfect timing.
I hope you guys kept the noise down.

576
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,525
See you then.

577
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,440
What was it like?
How do you feel?

578
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,763
Cleansed and victorious.

579
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,400
Doesn't get any better than that.

580
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,289
How about your first time?

581
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,683
Oh, let me think.
What was it like?

582
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,968
It wasn't all that pleasant.
Oh.

583
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,282
I mean, it was consensual
and everything...

584
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,768
...and I was in love with the guy,
but his dick seemed enormous to me.

585
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,322
I didn't think it would fit.
It was scary.

586
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,450
He was nice. I guess he couldn't help it.

587
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,967
Was he Chinese?
Are you kidding me?

588
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,130
I only dated white guys in high school.
Why is that?

589
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,408
Stick it to my mom and dad,
I suppose.

590
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,211
Are they happy now
you have a Chinese boyfriend?

591
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,488
They're happy. I'm happy.

592
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,571
What's his dick like?

593
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,765
Perfect size.

594
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,120
Why do you call it a
dick instead of a penis?

595
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,087
Dick...

596
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,811
Penis sounds like some vegetable
you don't want to eat.

597
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,327
Heh, heh.
Dick sounds like what it is.

598
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,683
The thing is...

599
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,609
...it was all over so damn quickly.

600
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,525
Yeah, tell me about it.

601
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,365
First session.

602
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,410
Mark O'Brien is the oldest
of four children...

603
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,642
...and raised Catholic.

604
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,042
He was extremely nervous.

605
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,728
He yelled a lot when I took off his shirt,
but I think more out of fear than pain.

606
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,363
He cannot masturbate, has had
only the occasional kissing experience.

607
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,048
He's capable of achieving an erection easily,
but the unusual curvature of his body...

608
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,329
...could be a serious
obstacle to intercourse.

609
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,964
I just started working with this gentleman
who spends almost his entire life...

610
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,442
...trapped in a big metal box.

611
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,048
Did you hear what I said?

612
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,770
Yes. Yes.

613
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,281
And you are a saint.

614
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,886
"Sometimes the head of the penis
may be too large...

615
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,203
...to penetrate the vaginal opening
smoothly...

616
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,961
...in which case the application
of lubricant is recommended...

617
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,522
...to avoid possible..."

618
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,808
Oh, my God.

619
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,722
So, what's on the menu
for today?

620
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,564
We're attempting intercourse.

621
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,848
Heh. The big one.

622
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,804
What do you think of it?

623
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,764
Intercourse.

624
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,331
Overrated but necessary.

625
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,324
Plenty of other ways
of achieving the same result.

626
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,007
Somehow you don't feel like you've done it
until you've gone all the way in.

627
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,843
I want you to look at me this time.

628
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,725
Come on, give it a try. Open your eyes.

629
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,690
Do you like watching me undress?

630
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,324
I do.

631
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,882
So from now on...

632
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,840
...you're gonna start to listen

00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,846
I don't understand.
I said I could feel like him.

792

Of course I can picture him.
From the outside.

795
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,763

...crew cut and his little face.

Yes.

And are you mad at him?

799
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:22,043

800
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,282

She either forgot to close the bathroom
door or didn't bother to close it.

803
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,323
I found the sound of her peeing
incredibly erotic.

804
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,244
And the sound of her tearing off
toilet paper incredibly intimate.

805
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,323
By the time she came back,
I had a terrific boner.

I did. I liked it.

My husband asked me to do it
before his grandmother dies.

The idea is, if it makes her

<i>...what do I have to show for myself?</i>

1269
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,370
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

1270
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,602
MARK:
<i>At the very least...</i>

1271
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:14,124
<i>...three beautiful women who all loved me.</i>

1272
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:17,410
<i>And who will all show up at my funeral.</i>

1273
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:23,642
His was a dynamic voice
in a paralyzed body.

1274
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:26,201
A life lived fully...

1275
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,801
...long after he should have been dead.

1276
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,328
And against all odds,
by Mark's own admission...

1277
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,767
...he knew love.

1278
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:36,968
Emotional and physical love.

1279
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,326
And in this way, Mark lived his life.

1280
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:44,245
Day by day by day...

1281
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:48,086
...breath by breath by breath.

1282
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:54,009
For 49 years,
he loved and he was loved.

1283
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:02,931
And now Susan Fernbach
will read one of Mark's favorite poems.

1284
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:12,966
This is called:

1285
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,922
"Love Poem for No One in Particular."

1286
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,644
<i>Let me touch you with my words</i>

1287
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,561
<i>For my hands</i>

1288
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:28,371
MARK:
<i>Lie limp as empty gloves.</i>

1289
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:31,485
<i>Let my words stroke your hair</i>

1290
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:36,202
<i>Slide down your back and tickle your belly.</i>

1291
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,250
<i>For my hands</i>

1292
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:41,961
<i>Light and free-flying as bricks</i>

1293
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:45,044
<i>Ignore my wishes and stubbornly refuse</i>

1294
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:48,886
<i>To carry out my quietest desires</i>

1295
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:52,965
<i>Let my words enter your mind</i>

1296
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:54,811
<i>Bearing torches</i>

1297
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:58,884
<i>Admit them willingly into your being</i>

1298
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:02,641
<i>So they may caress you gently within</i>

1299
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,211
<i>Within</i>
