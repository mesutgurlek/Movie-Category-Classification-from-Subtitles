1
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:57,439
<i>I never thought</i>
<i>That I could be so satisfied</i>

2
00:00:57,607 --> 00:01:01,134
<i>Every time that I look in your angel eyes</i>

3
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:06,010
<i>A shock inside me</i>
<i>That words just can't describe</i>

4
00:01:06,182 --> 00:01:08,776
<i>And there's no explaining</i>

5
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:12,683
<i>Something in the way you move</i>
<i>I can't deny</i>

6
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:16,348
<i>Every word from your lips is a lullaby</i>

7
00:01:16,526 --> 00:01:19,120
<i>A twist of fate makes life worthwhile</i>

8
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:21,889
<i>You are gold and silver</i>

9
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:26,793
<i>I said I wasn't gonna lose my head</i>

10
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,373
<i>- Nut then pop goes my heart</i>
<i>- Pop goes my heart</i>

11
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:34,374
<i>I wasn't gonna fall in love again</i>

12
00:01:34,544 --> 00:01:38,674
<i>- Nut then pop goes my heart</i>
<i>- Pop goes my heart</i>

13
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:43,808
<i>And I just can't let you go</i>

14
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:46,820
<i>I can't lose this feeling</i>

15
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,652
<i>These precious moments</i>
<i>We have so few</i>

16
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:54,422
<i>Let's go far away</i>
<i>Where there's nothing to do but play</i>

17
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:59,159
<i>You've shown to me</i>
<i>That my destiny's with you</i>

18
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:01,599
<i>And there's no explaining</i>

19
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,932
<i>I said I wasn't gonna lose my head</i>

20
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:09,772
<i>- Nut then pop goes my heart</i>
<i>- Pop goes my heart</i>

21
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:12,574
<i>I wasn't gonna fall in love again</i>

22
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:16,412
<i>- Nut then pop goes my heart</i>
<i>- Pop goes my heart</i>

23
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:21,785
<i>And I just can't let you go</i>

24
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:25,086
<i>I can't lose this feeling</i>

25
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:39,370
<i>A twist of fate makes life worthwhile</i>

26
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:43,979
<i>You are gold and silver</i>

27
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:46,980
<i>I said I wasn't gonna lose my head</i>

28
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,484
<i>- Nut then pop goes my heart</i>
<i>- Pop goes my heart</i>

29
00:02:51,654 --> 00:02:55,112
<i>I wasn't gonna fall in love again</i>

30
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,488
<i>- Nut then pop goes my heart</i>
<i>- Pop goes my heart</i>

31
00:02:58,661 --> 00:02:59,889
<i>And I just</i>

32
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:04,998
<i>Can't let you go</i>

33
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,636
<i>PoP was one of the biggest bands</i>
<i>of the '80s...</i>

34
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:12,400
<i>... but today they're known</i>
<i>as Colin Thompson's old group.</i>

35
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:15,567
<i>Colin, or as he's been dubbed</i>
<i>by the queen, "Sir Colin"...</i>

36
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:19,078
<i>... has gone on to sell millions of records,</i>
<i>star in blockbuster films...</i>

37
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:21,945
<i>... and create his own cologne,</i>
<i>"A Whiff of Colin."</i>

38
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,380
<i>Nut here's a question:</i>

39
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:26,920
<i>Can you remember the name</i>
<i>of the other guy in PoP?</i>

40
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,082
<i>Whatever happened to Alex Fletcher?</i>

41
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:34,686
<i>Tonight we find out</i>
<i>on</i> Battle of the '80s Has-Beens.

42
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,401
We think it's gonna be bigger
than <i>American Idol.</i>

43
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:41,036
So, what do you think, Alex?

44
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:42,330
Well, I love it.

45
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:46,441
It's brilliant on so many levels,
I don't even know where to start.

46
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:47,598
Good for you.

47
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:49,904
Because some of the people
we've approached...

48
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:53,947
...have had a little problem
with the term "has-been."

49
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:55,106
Have they? Have they?

50
00:03:55,285 --> 00:03:59,654
You see, I don't share that.
I am a happy has-been. Really.

51
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,052
It's a very clear statement:
"I live in the past.

52
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:04,125
Everything good I ever did
was long ago.

53
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:06,626
Don't expect anything
new or exciting from me now."

54
00:04:06,796 --> 00:04:09,663
Really takes the pressure off.
Especially on a first date.

55
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,197
Good for you.

56
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:14,401
So we've already taped several shows...

57
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,834
...and we're going to start
airing them this week.

58
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,668
And some of the performers
include REO Speedwagon...

59
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,673
- Speedwagon.
...Flock of Seagulls...

60
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,004
The Flock? Okay.

61
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,908
...Debbie Gibson, Tiffany...
- Debbie.

62
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:29,146
- History there.
...and Frankie Goes to Hollywood.

63
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:32,254
So "Relax."

64
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:34,689
Nice one.

65
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,417
Good. Okay. Worthy adversaries, all.

66
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:40,289
And how many songs
would I actually get to perform?

67
00:04:40,463 --> 00:04:42,090
I'd like to do two, you know?

68
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:44,495
A ballad and then maybe
a more up-tempo number...

69
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,158
...where I get to shake it a bit.

70
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:51,899
I can't promise any of the acts
that they'll be singing.

71
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:56,544
Sorry? Confused.
What would we be doing, then?

72
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,707
Boxing.

73
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:04,415
That's why the show is called
<i>Nattle of the '80s Has-Neens.</i>

74
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:08,614
Only the winner gets to sing.

75
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:18,127
Right, right, right. Got you.

76
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:25,970
- Afternoon, Mr. Fletcher.
- Hello, Willy.

77
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:27,131
Have a good day.

78
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,244
Yes, well, enjoyed it so far.

79
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:33,037
- All right. There he is.
- Oh, my manager.

80
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:35,912
All right, listen,
I had no idea they meant boxing.

81
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,882
Nobody said a word to me, I swear.

82
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:40,989
No, it's not a problem.
I can definitely take Flock of Seagulls.

83
00:05:41,157 --> 00:05:45,150
We did a tour with them in '89 and we beat
them severely. They cried like little girls.

84
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:48,923
All right, listen. It's my fault
and I hate myself for it, but I'm not upset.

85
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,759
And do you know why?

86
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,457
You've been at my liquor.

87
00:05:52,635 --> 00:05:53,932
Because of her.

88
00:05:55,638 --> 00:05:57,936
Cora Corman.
Biggest star in the world.

89
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,473
Bigger than Britney and Christina
put together.

90
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:03,908
And guess who she loves.

91
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,172
Her country?

92
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:11,351
You. She's a huge PoP fan
and she wants to meet you, Alex.

93
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:13,455
Hang on, hang on.

94
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,447
Khan, I've missed you.

95
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,651
<i>Alex, I have Sophie here for you.</i>

96
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:20,420
That sounds like fun. Who is she?

97
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:22,894
<i>She's here to do your plants.</i>

98
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:24,226
But Jane does my plants.

99
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,268
<i>She can be in and out in five minutes,</i>
<i>and this is really the best time for her.</i>

100
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:30,633
It seems she cannot be stopped.
Send her up.

101
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,434
So start again. Cora Corman...

102
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:36,635
Why do you have a plant lady?
Why do you even have plants?

103
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:39,113
Because from time to time...

104
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:41,409
...ladies accompany me
back to the apartment...

105
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:44,382
...and one once mentioned
that plants make women comfortable.

106
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:47,387
Is that true?
Plants make women comfortable?

107
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:50,390
Well, maybe if I had plants
I'd still be married.

108
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,221
Yes, I think that was the problem.

109
00:06:52,395 --> 00:06:54,386
Not Susan's affair
and raging nymphomania...

110
00:06:54,564 --> 00:06:56,498
...but your lack of vegetation.

111
00:06:58,101 --> 00:06:59,500
Hang on.

112
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:07,471
- Hi, I'm Sophie Fisher.
- I'm Alex Fletcher.

113
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:10,840
- You didn't get the message from Jane?
- No. I haven't listened to my...

114
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,573
She was supposed to let you know
I'd be doing plants.

115
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:16,278
Very nice. Lovely. Well, come on in.

116
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:17,510
Thank you.

117
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:21,623
I hope you have your own watering can.
Jane told me that everyone had their own.

118
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:25,921
But this last guy, Mr. Werther, about 80,
he didn't have his own watering can...

119
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:29,064
...so he starts yelling at me
and screaming at me in German:

120
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,668
I'm fluent enough
to know what he's saying.

121
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:35,770
You haven't been cursed at
till you've been cursed at in German.

122
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:38,099
I know what you mean.
I dated a fräulein once.

123
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:43,000
Plant stuff is in the kitchen under the sink.
And I have my own can.

124
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:45,443
Oh, well, <i>vielen Dank.</i>

125
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:48,577
Hi, I'm Chris Riley, Alex's manager.

126
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:51,720
Oh, Sophie Fisher. Nice to meet you.

127
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,387
So kitchen?

128
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,753
- Yeah.
- Great.

129
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:01,691
So Cora Corman, huh?
How great is that? Do you believe it?

130
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:05,391
All right, wait, wait, wait.
Is it even a good idea? Pros and cons.

131
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:10,267
Pros: She's a huge star,
great publicity, terrific money.

132
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:12,434
Cons?

133
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:15,236
No matter what you do,
in 40 years we'll both be dead.

134
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:19,074
Okay. Huge star, great publicity,
terrific money versus eventual death.

135
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,875
I think we have to think about it.

136
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,450
Okay, good, because Cora
is shooting a video tonight.

137
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:26,087
- She wants to meet both of us right after.
- Tonight?

138
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,449
- Tonight?
- Yes, tonight.

139
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,183
You all right?

140
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:34,826
Do you have a Band-Aid
and antibiotic cream?

141
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:38,831
No, no. And sadly,
I think I've lent out my iron lung.

142
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:40,093
Okay.

143
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,636
Well, then I'm gonna go because,
you know, this could get infected.

144
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:47,606
And it's not clotting yet, but, I mean,
I'm a little hypochondriacal.

145
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,405
You just... You can never be too careful.

146
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,775
Anyway, I'll come back and finish.

147
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,782
So come again. I mean, you live here.
I'll come again.

148
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,442
I'm gonna go get this looked at.

149
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,488
You should really have a first-aid kit.
Thank you. Have a good night. I'll see you.

150
00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:05,553
Weird.

151
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:08,356
- Don't give her a key.
- No.

152
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:10,260
So you said something about tonight.

153
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:12,424
Tonight we meet Cora.

154
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:20,237
<i>I've got to have my Nuddha's delight</i>

155
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:23,003
<i>Om shanti, shanti</i>

156
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:25,204
<i>I've got to have my Nuddha's delight</i>

157
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:28,179
<i>Om shanti, shanti</i>

158
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:30,881
<i>I want a revelation</i>

159
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,683
<i>And sweet salvation</i>

160
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:35,847
<i>And the eternal fire</i>

161
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:38,323
<i>Show me the eternal fire</i>

162
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:42,156
<i>Like sitting meditation</i>

163
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:44,928
<i>You give me elevation</i>
<i>Can you take me higher?</i>

164
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:47,535
She seems like a very spiritual kid.

165
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:50,900
Yeah. It's nice to see
a young woman exploring religion.

166
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,849
<i>I'm not satisfied if I don't get</i>

167
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,816
<i>My Nuddha's delight</i>

168
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:10,185
And cut.

169
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,286
Terrific.

170
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:16,922
- Hey, I'm Ray, Cora's manager.
- Chris Riley.

171
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:18,623
- Nice to meet you.
- Alex Fletcher.

172
00:10:18,801 --> 00:10:20,234
- Great to meet you.
- Hi, Ray...?

173
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:23,463
Just Ray. Cora's this way, come on.
Follow me.

174
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,844
C, this is Alex Fletcher
and his manager, Chris Riley.

175
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:32,105
- We loved the video. It was unbelievable.
- Yeah.

176
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:35,717
You know, I wish I brought my daughter.
She worships you.

177
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,013
I'm divorced. But that's another story.

178
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:44,518
Mr. Fletcher, it's a pleasure.

179
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:50,464
Your song "Dance With Me Tonight" got me
through my parents' divorce when I was 7.

180
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:51,759
Really? Wow.

181
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:54,903
Yeah, because I recorded that
when I was 9, so... Yeah.

182
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:59,371
I want my fans to know the same
spiritual uplift that your music gave me.

183
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:02,909
That would be lovely. I have a few tunes
it would be nice to update.

184
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,674
Oh, I don't live in the past, Mr. Fletcher.
It was so long ago.

185
00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:08,817
I want you to write a new song.

186
00:11:09,852 --> 00:11:11,114
- Okay.
- You see...

187
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:13,255
...I recently broke up with my boyfriend.

188
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,255
We had been together
for almost two months.

189
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:18,487
It was a terrible experience.

190
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:22,597
But then I read a book by Guru Mathashavi
called <i>A Way Nack Into Love</i>.

191
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:25,596
And that will be the title
of our new song.

192
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,703
And in two weeks when I open my tour
at Madison Square Garden...

193
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:30,395
...we'll perform it together.

194
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:31,767
Okay. Here's the snag...

195
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,909
We also wanna put the song
on her new CD...

196
00:11:34,076 --> 00:11:36,840
...which is pretty much finished,
so we need it by Friday.

197
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:39,344
- This Friday?
- Yeah, but don't feel any pressure.

198
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:43,007
We've got seven other retro artists
working on "Way Back Into Love"...

199
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:45,346
...so if you blow it, we're covered.

200
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:48,684
Mr. Fletcher,
don't look at this as a competition.

201
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:51,656
If it's meant to be, it will be.

202
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:53,294
It's destiny.

203
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,486
Yes.

204
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:56,187
Or not.

205
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,596
Okay.

206
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:06,037
I can't possibly write a song by Friday.
What could she be thinking of?

207
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,369
All right. Look, look,
can I be honest with you?

208
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:10,671
You're my manager.
I would have to fire you.

209
00:12:10,846 --> 00:12:12,438
We need this.

210
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:15,812
Let's not be desperate.
We have the state fairs, Knott's Berry Farm.

211
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:16,974
They've canceled.

212
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,316
Knott's Berry canceled?

213
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:25,193
Look. We're still on
for the Indiana State Fair, okay?

214
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:28,194
But Texas and Arkansas dropped us.

215
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:31,060
- The Apple Picking?
- The Apple Picking Festival is a go...

216
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:34,896
...but Great Adventure only wants
three nights instead of 10. All right?

217
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,096
My God. I had no idea.
Why didn't you tell me these things? Why...?

218
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:40,139
I'm telling... I'm telling you now.

219
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:43,210
Alex, it's been 15 years since PoP.

220
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:46,109
There's new old acts
coming up all the time.

221
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:50,116
Tears for Fears is going on tour.
There's talk of a Spice Girl reunion.

222
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:52,083
- That's not my audience.
- Ricky Martin.

223
00:12:52,254 --> 00:12:54,882
I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead.
I'm finished. I'm finished.

224
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:57,821
- No, you're not dead.
- I'm gonna wind up doing bar mitzvahs.

225
00:12:57,993 --> 00:13:01,827
No, you're not. Thirteen-year-old kids
have no idea who you are.

226
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:03,191
Well, that's good to know.

227
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,391
What about you? You might actually
have to take on another client.

228
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:10,630
Look, don't worry about me. What we gotta
concentrate on is refreshing your image.

229
00:13:10,806 --> 00:13:14,105
Then we'll get Knott's Berry
and Great Adventure. Who knows?

230
00:13:14,276 --> 00:13:17,609
- We might even get Disneyland.
- Don't tease me. I'm very vulnerable.

231
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,112
Tell you something, Alex.
You do a song for Cora...

232
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:23,376
...and there is a spot for you
in the Magic Kingdom, baby.

233
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,851
Writing a song. I thought I was done
with that whole nightmare.

234
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:29,547
Just one song.
That's all we need. One song.

235
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:31,754
But it's so...

236
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:34,285
...time-consuming, you know?

237
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:38,433
And I haven't written for 10 years.

238
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:42,037
And I need a lyricist. And it's never worked
with anyone except Colin.

239
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:45,105
Look, I know it's not easy
to get somebody good this fast...

240
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:48,334
...but there is this guy.
Supposedly he's very hip, very edgy.

241
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:50,672
He just worked with Avril.

242
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:58,645
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm just a bit blocked here.

243
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:01,187
If you don't like the lyrics,
be straight with me.

244
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,215
No, no, no, no.
The lyrics are very, very powerful.

245
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:08,256
Maybe you want something
more commercial? More PoP-y?

246
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:11,794
Just hold that thinly veiled insult
for one second.

247
00:14:17,473 --> 00:14:18,997
- Hello.
- Hey.

248
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:22,575
- Khan said I could just come up?
- They were able to save the whole hand.

249
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:25,805
I know. I made too big a deal out of it.

250
00:14:25,981 --> 00:14:29,246
It's just that I hate infections.
But then again, who likes them?

251
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:32,785
- Maybe the people who make penicillin.
- There's two sides to every story.

252
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:36,755
True. Except for the Nazis. I can't really see
the other side of that argument.

253
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:38,223
Excuse me?

254
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:41,329
I'm sorry. I didn't even see you there.
Hi. I'm Sophie Fisher.

255
00:14:41,497 --> 00:14:45,024
Yeah, Sophie, this is Greg Antonsky.
He's a noted lyricist.

256
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:50,800
Really? Well, I don't wanna get in your way.
And I can see that I already have.

257
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,636
So I'm off to the kitchen. Don't tell me.

258
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,334
She's kind of hot.

259
00:14:56,512 --> 00:14:59,037
Good. Yeah. I'm glad you enjoyed her.

260
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:01,710
She's coming back in here, right?

261
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:05,217
I would imagine so. Unless she goes
directly back to the mother ship.

262
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,652
How about:

263
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,957
<i>Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch</i>

264
00:15:11,126 --> 00:15:13,788
<i>I look real good, but I'm a nasty bitch</i>

265
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:17,023
<i>I can scream and claw</i>
<i>And curdle your blood</i>

266
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,636
<i>Nut you'll die on your way back into love</i>

267
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:25,630
No. Start on a minor third. Try that.

268
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:28,276
Right. So:

269
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:31,038
<i>Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch</i>

270
00:15:31,213 --> 00:15:32,908
<i>I look real good, but I'm a nasty...</i>

271
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:34,777
Come on. You're missing the point.

272
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,977
From the first line.
"Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch" is okay.

273
00:15:39,154 --> 00:15:40,451
But then it should be...

274
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:44,684
<i>Nut with some magic, I just might switch</i>

275
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:51,655
Sorry. What did you say?

276
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:55,893
I don't remember.

277
00:15:56,338 --> 00:16:00,206
I think it was,
"But with some magic, I just might switch."

278
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,072
- That is actually quite intriguing.
- That's not my lyric.

279
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:04,974
No, I know, but it's a lovely phrase.

280
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:07,911
Look, if you can't handle anything
except moon and June...

281
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,917
...why don't we just let
plant girl finish the lyrics?

282
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:13,349
Plant girl.

283
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:16,116
<i>Give it up, I'm a bad hot witch</i>

284
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,521
<i>Nut with some magic, I just might switch</i>

285
00:16:18,694 --> 00:16:22,494
- Finish it.
- I'm just here to cater to the plants.

286
00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:24,758
And you are doing a fine job,
if I may say so.

287
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:26,525
Although that one is plastic.

288
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:30,366
This is a waste of time.

289
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:34,299
<i>Let's fly my broom to the stars above</i>

290
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:38,310
<i>And we'll charm our way back into love</i>

291
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:46,783
What's the next line,
"Feelings, nothing more than feelings"?

292
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,417
You people disgust me.

293
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,094
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gotten involved.
I have no filtering system.

294
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,630
No. That's fine, that's fine.

295
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,200
He had to get back to his job
at Hallmark anyway.

296
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:02,803
Listen, have you ever done any writing?

297
00:17:02,971 --> 00:17:06,168
I mean, everybody's done some writing,
you know? Well, not everybody.

298
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:08,571
Illiteracy is a growing epidemic
in this country.

299
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:10,268
I write slogans for Weight-Not...

300
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,142
...this weight reduction company
that my sister runs.

301
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:15,647
Did you ever hear of the band PoP?

302
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:19,811
Yeah, of course, everybody has.
My sister Rhonda loved them.

303
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:23,014
They had that ridiculous hair
and those ridiculous outfits and...

304
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:24,682
Oh, my God, you're one of them.

305
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,959
That hair was very much in style then.

306
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,098
- I'm very sorry.
- Yeah, that's fine.

307
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:33,359
But I would love to talk to you
about maybe writing some lyrics.

308
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:34,929
But I don't write lyrics.

309
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:38,130
Well, we could just kick some ideas around,
repot the ficus.

310
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,605
I don't think so.
I appreciate the offer, though.

311
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:43,438
I have to go babysit for my sister now.
I mean, her kids.

312
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:47,241
She's 38 now, so... Thank you.

313
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,777
Okay, listen.
Do you know who Cora Corman is?

314
00:17:51,954 --> 00:17:53,581
Oh, yeah. My niece loves her.

315
00:17:53,756 --> 00:17:56,953
Okay, well, I'm writing a song for her,
so if you change your mind...

316
00:17:57,126 --> 00:18:01,062
...and the idea of working with me is
of any interest at all, please just call, okay?

317
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,666
Or if you just fancy a good laugh,
I am performing at the Hilton tonight.

318
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,200
Well, thank you.
I mean, but I can't, you know. I'm sorry.

319
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,362
"I just can't," she says mysteriously.
But I just can't.

320
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,974
- I'm sorry. Thank you for the offer.
- Yes.

321
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:20,807
Oh, my God.

322
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,577
Go to the next level, weirdo.

323
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:26,118
You have to go to the next level.

324
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,885
It's your parents. Go get into bed.
Get into bed. This is not a drill.

325
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:33,824
- But we haven't even brushed our teeth.
- Get in there. Get in there. Get into bed.

326
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:35,995
- Hey.
- Hi.

327
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:37,996
- How was the movie?
- I enjoyed it.

328
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:39,998
- He fell asleep.
- I enjoy sleeping.

329
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:41,898
- How was dinner?
- Really nice place.

330
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,130
It's really hard to enjoy dinner
when you run a weight-loss center.

331
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:48,276
- Lf I get fat, there goes my fiscal year.
- Honey, you're not fat.

332
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:51,469
You're not about to open a branch in Boca.
But thank you, sweetie.

333
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,911
- How'd everything go here?
- Oh, yeah. Good. Great.

334
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:56,516
The kids ate and went to sleep.

335
00:18:58,587 --> 00:19:01,750
Yeah, it... They're really bad children.

336
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:05,649
Okay, okay. Everybody goes to bed.
I'm sending your father in there.

337
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:10,026
Whoa, we're so scared.

338
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:12,565
And then I'm coming in.

339
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:16,730
I'll just go check
to make sure they're still breathing.

340
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,599
Hey, wanna do some stress eating?
Just a piece of diet cheesecake.

341
00:19:20,776 --> 00:19:24,041
This thing happened to me today...
I don't know. I'm just gonna go home.

342
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:25,407
You seem so jumpy tonight.

343
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,049
You know, I feel a little guilty
about something.

344
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:29,377
How unusual for you.

345
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:31,444
Okay, listen. I have to tell you.

346
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,647
I met that guy from that band
you used to like. Alex Fletcher from PoP?

347
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:36,882
Oh, my God.

348
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:40,586
Anyway, I do Jane's plant service.
I'm taking over for her while she's gone.

349
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,287
And anyway, she does his apartment,
so I was there.

350
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:44,989
Actually, it was the second time.

351
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:47,533
And he invited me
to come see him perform tonight.

352
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:49,500
Gary, I'm going out!

353
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:53,801
Oh, my God. I love him. I love him.
I love him. I love him.

354
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,075
- That really wasn't the end of the story.
- Come on. Help me dress.

355
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:00,579
Should I wear the red one?

356
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:26,199
<i>I saw you across the dance floor</i>

357
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,276
<i>Out of the corner of my eye</i>

358
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,836
<i>I felt a connection</i>

359
00:20:32,014 --> 00:20:35,643
<i>I don't know how, I don't know why</i>

360
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,809
<i>I shouldn't have stayed</i>
<i>When I saw you there</i>

361
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,182
<i>With another man</i>

362
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:44,655
<i>Nut as we slipped away</i>
<i>I thought I heard you say:</i>

363
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,954
<i>"This wasn't part of the plan"</i>

364
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:51,696
<i>Just a meaningless kiss</i>

365
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:55,829
<i>It wasn't supposed to end up like this</i>

366
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,699
<i>Just a meaningless kiss</i>

367
00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:04,243
<i>Just a meaningless kiss</i>

368
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:07,678
<i>We knew it was wrong</i>
<i>Nut we couldn't resist</i>

369
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,840
<i>Just a meaningless kiss</i>

370
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:14,512
<i>'Till I fell in love with you</i>

371
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,215
Girls, tell me the truth.
Are these pants too tight?

372
00:21:20,128 --> 00:21:21,823
Oh, my God, I gotta get up there.

373
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:23,692
<i>And here we are two years later</i>

374
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,265
<i>Too late to turn back now</i>

375
00:21:26,435 --> 00:21:29,370
<i>We've gotta finish</i>
<i>What we shouldn't have started</i>

376
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,564
<i>We gotta walk away somehow</i>

377
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:35,642
<i>Nut it's easier said than done</i>

378
00:21:35,811 --> 00:21:38,041
<i>When two hearts beat as one</i>

379
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:41,339
<i>And three hearts are one too many</i>

380
00:21:41,516 --> 00:21:43,916
<i>That's why we shouldn't have ever begun</i>

381
00:21:47,022 --> 00:21:48,853
<i>Just a meaningless kiss</i>

382
00:21:49,024 --> 00:21:52,755
<i>We knew it was wrong</i>
<i>Nut we couldn't resist</i>

383
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:54,589
<i>Just a meaningless kiss</i>

384
00:21:54,763 --> 00:21:59,427
<i>'Till I fell in love with you</i>

385
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:13,379
<i>We can't go on like this forever</i>

386
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:16,278
<i>When we're not meant to be together</i>

387
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:19,420
<i>So leave me here on my own</i>

388
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:23,422
<i>From now on I guess</i>
<i>I've gotta dance alone</i>

389
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,688
<i>It wasn't supposed to end up like this</i>

390
00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:44,474
- Alex!
- Alex!

391
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:46,170
- Hello, girls.
- Alex, I'm Barbara.

392
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:48,646
In Boston, in 1989,
I came back to your hotel...

393
00:22:48,817 --> 00:22:52,253
If you wanna see Alex again,
check his website for the tour schedule.

394
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:56,255
And the Knott's Berry Farm show
is temporarily postponed, okay?

395
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:59,622
Great show, huh? They love you.
They're hot for you.

396
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:03,128
Of course, they're also hot because
so many are going through menopause.

397
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:07,564
Wait a minute.
Barbara from Boston. From Boston.

398
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:10,671
I do remember that Barbara. I do.
I'm going back for one second.

399
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:13,831
No. That's how we wind up
getting chased by angry husbands.

400
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:16,068
- Not necessarily. She...
- Hi.

401
00:23:16,244 --> 00:23:17,609
Well, hi.

402
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:21,215
Hello. Hello, hello. Very good news. Yes.

403
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:22,714
Chris, you remember Sophie?

404
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:24,875
Planted in my memory.

405
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:29,549
I just wanted to apologize
for being so cryptic earlier.

406
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:32,386
- This is my sister, Rhonda.
- Hi.

407
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:37,998
I'm sorry. I've...
You were so great tonight.

408
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,101
We've met, haven't we? Right?
We were practically a duet there.

409
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:43,362
I know. Anyway,
could I get a quick autograph?

410
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:44,903
You may, Rhonda.

411
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:47,564
- Could I get a picture too?
- Only if you're single.

412
00:23:47,742 --> 00:23:50,472
I've been married 16 years,
but nothing's written in stone.

413
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:51,976
Could you scootch? Thanks.

414
00:23:52,147 --> 00:23:54,547
Also, I really wanted to thank you
for your offer.

415
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:57,184
- What offer?
- While Greg, the rhyming psychopath...

416
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,410
Thanks again for him.

417
00:23:58,587 --> 00:24:01,852
- Was in my apartment, Sophie spouted
some really interesting lyrics.

418
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,513
I thought she was doing plants.

419
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,989
I'm holding a pose here.

420
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,321
- I appreciate it...
- I need a song by Friday...

421
00:24:07,496 --> 00:24:10,329
...and it is amazingly difficult
to find a sane lyricist.

422
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:12,592
Why don't you just
write the lyrics yourself?

423
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:15,702
- That's really not a strength of his.
- That's absolutely right.

424
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,896
I once rhymed "you and me"
with "autopsy."

425
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:19,734
Well, that's not necessarily bad.

426
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:21,967
You could do something with that.
You know?

427
00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:26,911
<i>Figuring out you and me</i>
<i>Is like doing a love autopsy</i>

428
00:24:27,082 --> 00:24:30,245
- You see, you see. That's quite good.
- That's not bad.

429
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:34,479
- Go on. More. How does it go?
- I have no idea.

430
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:36,954
Someone could have sculpted us
in this time.

431
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:38,490
You know what? Let me take it.

432
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,857
<i>They could operate all day long</i>
<i>And never figure out what went wrong</i>

433
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,897
My God, you are...
You are Cole Porter in panties.

434
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:48,558
Of course, having said that,
Cole Porter probably did wear panties.

435
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,228
Anyway, thank you for inviting us.

436
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:55,638
Okay, I'm just gonna take a real quick one.
Let me take it. Let me take it, Sophie.

437
00:24:56,144 --> 00:24:58,578
- Thank you so much. That was great.
- Hang on.

438
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,874
Nice to meet you guys. Bye-bye.

439
00:25:06,454 --> 00:25:08,513
So this is where Sophie works, eh?

440
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,658
Yeah. She is gonna be right out.

441
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:13,055
Excellent. Excellent.
Thank you very much.

442
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:16,759
So how much do you weigh?

443
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,664
I fluctuate. Yeah.

444
00:25:22,337 --> 00:25:24,897
Okay, look, I am terribly sorry
to barge in like this...

445
00:25:25,073 --> 00:25:27,803
...but I have decided
I cannot take no for an answer.

446
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:29,807
- I told you that...
- You're not a writer.

447
00:25:29,978 --> 00:25:32,446
Except when you are writing poems
and short stories...

448
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,411
...in the New School literary magazine.

449
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,244
I Googled you. And you were good.

450
00:25:36,418 --> 00:25:38,010
Look, I'm flattered.

451
00:25:38,186 --> 00:25:42,145
I mean, you're one of six people
in the world who's actually read those...

452
00:25:42,324 --> 00:25:44,690
...but that doesn't mean
I can write a song.

453
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,221
You already did.
Five minutes, that's all I ask.

454
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:53,592
Please, step in. You'll enjoy this.
This is a treat.

455
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:55,903
Mr. Fletcher. Nice to see you.

456
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:58,471
- Very nice to see you, Mia, how are you?
- Wonderful.

457
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,108
I just want to get...
Can I try the new Mason & Hamlin?

458
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:04,939
- Sure, absolutely. Be my guest.
- Thank you very much. Thanks. Please.

459
00:26:05,113 --> 00:26:09,379
This is... It's just a little something
that you might possibly recognize.

460
00:26:10,885 --> 00:26:14,082
<i>Figuring out you and me</i>

461
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:18,886
<i>Is like doing a love autopsy</i>

462
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,029
<i>They could operate all day long</i>

463
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:25,758
<i>And never figure out what went wrong</i>

464
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,232
<i>Love autopsy</i>

465
00:26:30,872 --> 00:26:32,999
<i>Love autopsy</i>

466
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:44,080
<i>What went wrong?</i>

467
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:52,984
God. That melody is so beautiful.

468
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:55,152
But I've never written a song.

469
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,730
A song. I know, I know.
And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

470
00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:01,926
I just don't think I am.
I think you may be a born lyricist.

471
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,736
We don't have very long,
but what I'd like to do, in an ideal world...

472
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:09,501
...is continue the "Autopsy" song.

473
00:27:09,678 --> 00:27:12,476
But I think it's gonna be very hard
to get back from there...

474
00:27:12,647 --> 00:27:15,707
...into "Way Back Into Love,"
which is the title that Cora demands.

475
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:19,650
What we could do is continue
with Greg "the Angel of Death's" version.

476
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:21,186
That's plagiarism.

477
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:23,449
Yes. Yes, yes. Good. Excellent.

478
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:26,219
I would never in a million years
use someone else's work.

479
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,588
I'm very glad you agree.

480
00:27:27,762 --> 00:27:33,359
So, what we need,
we need something brand-new.

481
00:27:34,469 --> 00:27:37,870
- So let's see. A song for Cora.
- Yes.

482
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:41,839
- Has to be called "A Way Back Into Love."
- Correct.

483
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,308
And it has to be something
Cora would sing about.

484
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:45,741
Good.

485
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,075
And it has to be something
you would sing about.

486
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,409
Good, yeah.

487
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,747
- What would you sing about?
- Whatever gets me the job, really.

488
00:27:53,321 --> 00:27:55,687
Oh, that's inspiring.

489
00:28:01,062 --> 00:28:05,499
Okay. Two people
searching for love, for salvation.

490
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:06,964
Good, good, I love that.

491
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:10,502
Love lost, love found.

492
00:28:11,139 --> 00:28:12,470
Love lost again.

493
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,269
Yes, this is starting to sound
a little bit like luggage, but good.

494
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,521
Thanks. That's really helpful.

495
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,464
It doesn't have to be perfect.
Just spit it out.

496
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,034
- They're just lyrics.
- "Just lyrics"?

497
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:46,666
Lyrics are important.
They're just not as important as melody.

498
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:49,670
I really don't think you get it.

499
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,010
Oh, you look angry. Click your pen.

500
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,115
A melody is like seeing someone
for the first time.

501
00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:57,148
The physical attraction. Sex.

502
00:28:57,752 --> 00:28:59,617
I so get that.

503
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:02,916
But then, as you get to know the person,
that's the lyrics.

504
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:05,719
Their story. Who they are underneath.

505
00:29:06,394 --> 00:29:10,660
It's the combination of the two
that makes it magic.

506
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,424
Let's go for a walk.

507
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,569
- A walk? What, now?
- Yeah.

508
00:29:15,737 --> 00:29:20,071
Out on the streets you see things
and, you know, hear things and eat things.

509
00:29:20,241 --> 00:29:22,732
It all sort of unlocks your mind.

510
00:29:27,449 --> 00:29:29,110
This is good. This is good.

511
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:31,548
When you hit a wall,
you gotta change the subject.

512
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:33,016
So why did PoP break up?

513
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,986
I mean, Rhonda told me
that you guys were friends growing up?

514
00:29:36,157 --> 00:29:38,489
We were, yes,
and then Colin met a new manager...

515
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,890
...who convinced him
he was the star of the band.

516
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:44,554
Shortly after, he left, taking the last
three songs we'd written together...

517
00:29:44,732 --> 00:29:48,498
...and putting them on his solo album
which went on to sell eight million records.

518
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,332
But how did you deal with that?

519
00:29:51,506 --> 00:29:53,440
Oh, with drugs, alcohol...

520
00:29:53,608 --> 00:29:57,635
...and ultimately, my own solo album.

521
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,578
Cool.

522
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:06,311
This copy has been in the racks
for six years.

523
00:30:06,488 --> 00:30:08,217
- Come on.
- No, no. I check every week.

524
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,857
You see, I made a little mark,
there on the back. See?

525
00:30:11,025 --> 00:30:13,858
It sold only 50,000 copies,
most of those to my mother.

526
00:30:14,028 --> 00:30:16,588
<i>Rolling Stone</i> called it
"a crass, contrived effort...

527
00:30:16,764 --> 00:30:19,289
...not even good enough
for a dentist chair."

528
00:30:20,768 --> 00:30:22,963
Well, I'm sure there were other reviews.

529
00:30:23,137 --> 00:30:25,537
There were, there were.
But none as good as that one.

530
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:27,641
And they were right, by the way. Yeah.

531
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:32,636
To cut a long story short,
I gave up trying to write...

532
00:30:32,814 --> 00:30:35,578
...lost an incredible amount of money
and then my apartment.

533
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,776
Chris stuck by me, booked me
an '80s reunion night on Long Island.

534
00:30:38,953 --> 00:30:41,046
And suddenly, they liked me again.

535
00:30:41,222 --> 00:30:43,452
It was weird.
It was like I'd never been away.

536
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:45,525
The audience was a tad older, as was I...

537
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:48,958
...but we were very, very profoundly happy
to see each other again.

538
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,963
And it went on from there.

539
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:55,660
Cruises. Reunions. Knott's Berry Farm,
which I'm sure you're familiar with.

540
00:30:55,837 --> 00:30:59,534
Busch Gardens,
that's one of my big fixtures of the year.

541
00:30:59,707 --> 00:31:01,038
What else can I tell you?

542
00:31:01,209 --> 00:31:04,736
I really appreciate
you opening up to me like this.

543
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,308
I know what it's like
to live with a shadow overhead.

544
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:14,249
What?

545
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,818
Shadow.

546
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:23,123
<i>I've been living with a shadow overhead</i>

547
00:31:24,065 --> 00:31:26,295
Now, that's a nice melody, isn't it?

548
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,264
- It's good.
- Thank you. Thank you.

549
00:31:28,436 --> 00:31:30,961
Mind you, what do you know?
You don't even like melody.

550
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,800
I never said that.

551
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,874
You prefer the lyrics.

552
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:36,101
I don't trust you.

553
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:37,642
Your turn, what's next?

554
00:31:38,613 --> 00:31:40,945
I think that we should get
some breakfast.

555
00:31:41,115 --> 00:31:43,913
Please, come on, we're finally
on a roll here. Listen again.

556
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:47,851
<i>I've been living with a shadow overhead</i>

557
00:31:48,022 --> 00:31:51,185
<i>There'll be no more rhymes until I'm fed</i>

558
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,883
Please, seriously, seriously.

559
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:55,154
<i>I've been living with a shadow overhead</i>

560
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,163
<i>I could be inspired</i>
<i>With just a piece of bread</i>

561
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,959
- I have the perfect place.
- Wait a minute.

562
00:32:01,135 --> 00:32:02,466
It's just on the next corner.

563
00:32:02,637 --> 00:32:04,537
- Keep moving and keep writing.
- All right.

564
00:32:04,706 --> 00:32:08,267
<i>I've been looking</i>
<i>For someone to shed some light</i>

565
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,607
- That's good. That's good.
- Yeah?

566
00:32:10,778 --> 00:32:12,643
Shadows and light. You're deep.

567
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:15,647
Okay, we need two more lines
of Cora verse. What's next?

568
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:17,148
Soph?

569
00:32:20,054 --> 00:32:21,043
Sophie?

570
00:32:22,557 --> 00:32:24,149
What are you doing?

571
00:32:24,325 --> 00:32:25,724
Nothing.

572
00:32:25,893 --> 00:32:29,886
I thought I saw someone,
but it wasn't him. So it's fine.

573
00:32:30,064 --> 00:32:33,465
- Oh, there he is.
- What?

574
00:32:33,635 --> 00:32:36,604
A very nice picture, though.
That's funny.

575
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,705
Interestingly enough, I mean...
Well, it is a bookstore.

576
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,036
- So, you know, that does happen.
- What?

577
00:32:44,612 --> 00:32:46,603
Gosh, where were we? Okay.

578
00:32:46,781 --> 00:32:48,078
<i>Shadow overhead</i>

579
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:52,083
Okay, can I just say, with all due respect,
that you are clearly...

580
00:32:52,253 --> 00:32:54,221
What is the word?
- Insane at this moment.

581
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,222
And because, according to Chris,
we have less than 36 hours...

582
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,520
...before Cora goes to do <i>Leno</i>,
at which point my career is over...

583
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:06,099
...it would be infinitely better for me
if you were sane. So how can I help?

584
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,130
Do you know this book?

585
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:16,272
<i>Sally Michaels?</i> Yes, yes.
Big bestseller. Yes.

586
00:33:16,444 --> 00:33:18,537
- Have you read it?
- No, of course not.

587
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:22,774
Last book I read was <i>The Alex Fletcher Story</i>
by the editors of <i>Teen Dream Magazine.</i>

588
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:26,286
Why?

589
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:33,919
I'm Sally Michaels.

590
00:33:36,497 --> 00:33:40,024
<i>I saw that they were giving these courses</i>
<i>on writing at the New School...</i>

591
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:42,192
<i>... so I signed up.</i>

592
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:45,771
<i>And my teacher was Sloan Cates.</i>

593
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,931
<i>Nrilliant, handsome.</i>

594
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:51,340
The truth is, I was in love with him.

595
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,138
And we began spending
every minute together.

596
00:33:54,315 --> 00:33:58,115
Which is why I was sort of surprised
when his fiancée showed up.

597
00:33:59,387 --> 00:34:02,914
Yeah, he never mentioned that
he was engaged to a history professor...

598
00:34:03,091 --> 00:34:05,525
...who was on a year-long sabbatical
in Spain.

599
00:34:05,693 --> 00:34:08,184
And when she popped in
for an unexpected visit...

600
00:34:08,362 --> 00:34:11,957
...it sort of turned into a reenactment
of the Inquisition.

601
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,925
And that... And that was that?
That was the end of that?

602
00:34:15,103 --> 00:34:17,196
Yeah. We never saw each other again.

603
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:20,602
I dropped the class and a year later,
his new novel showed up.

604
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:22,839
The Sally What's-it novel.

605
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,740
"The tale of a student
with exalted literary aspirations...

606
00:34:25,913 --> 00:34:30,213
...who lures a brilliant writer into an affair
so she can take advantage of his connections.

607
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:35,052
But when he tries to break it off,
she devotes herself to ruining his life."

608
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:37,721
Well, I mean, that obviously wasn't you.

609
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:44,662
Well, she's a lit major from Long Island,
5'4", my color hair, all my habits.

610
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,858
You know, talks to herself
and asks too many questions.

611
00:34:48,035 --> 00:34:50,469
Her parents founded
a weight reduction company...

612
00:34:50,638 --> 00:34:52,401
...that now her sister runs.

613
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:54,741
Well, anyway, I...

614
00:34:55,476 --> 00:34:58,172
Since then, every time I pick up a pen...

615
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,747
...l'm haunted by those words
that he wrote, you know?

616
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:04,942
"She was a brilliant mimic." You know.

617
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,917
"She could ape Dorothy Parker
or Emily Dickinson...

618
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:11,252
...but stripped of someone else's
literary clothes...

619
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:15,828
...she was a vacant,
empty imitation of a writer."

620
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:19,723
First of all, you can't listen to some jerk.

621
00:35:20,234 --> 00:35:23,601
He's not a jerk.
He's a National Book Award winner.

622
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:27,172
Well, then, get the best revenge,
write a hit song.

623
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:31,272
Honestly, I don't think a pop song
is gonna impress Sloan Cates.

624
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:34,477
Oh, no, of course not.
Pop is just for morons. Forgot that.

625
00:35:34,649 --> 00:35:37,914
- I didn't mean anything by it.
- Brain-dead, or taken too many drugs.

626
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:40,110
You know what I'd say
to you and Sloan Cates?

627
00:35:40,288 --> 00:35:42,449
You can take all the novels
in the world...

628
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:45,854
...and not one of them
will make you feel as good as fast as:

629
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,701
That is real poetry. Those are real poets.

630
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:58,896
Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder,
Bob Dylan, the Beatles.

631
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:03,032
Okay. What if one of your heroes
came up to you and said...

632
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:05,771
You know, Smokey, what if he said:

633
00:36:05,947 --> 00:36:09,747
"Alex Fletcher,
you are a horrible songwriter"?

634
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:10,906
How would you react?

635
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:14,748
I know Smokey a little bit. He's too nice
a gentleman ever to say such a thing.

636
00:36:15,823 --> 00:36:19,088
Dylan might. Dylan would, actually.
In fact, Dylan did.

637
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,129
Okay, Dylan walks up to you and he says,
"You are a horrible songwriter."

638
00:36:25,499 --> 00:36:27,797
- How do you react?
- I would be horribly depressed.

639
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:30,597
Yes. I would. I would.

640
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:34,434
But then, after, you know,
months of brooding...

641
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,442
...I would find a lyricist...

642
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:41,707
...and write a song
about how horribly depressed I was.

643
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:45,512
And it would be a big hit, everyone
would love me, and I'd make lots of money.

644
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:48,382
Suddenly I'd be less depressed
than if I just sat around...

645
00:36:48,556 --> 00:36:51,923
...being a little bit self-indulgent,
letting my misery eat away at me...

646
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:56,996
...until I'd become an emotional wreck
and creatively completely moribund.

647
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:01,096
Yes, moribund.

648
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,134
- Okay, let's go. Come on.
- All right.

649
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:11,541
<i>I've been living with a shadow overhead</i>

650
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:15,648
<i>I've been sleeping</i>
<i>With a clown above my bed</i>

651
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:18,376
- "Clown" is not right. What is that word?
- It's "cloud."

652
00:37:18,552 --> 00:37:22,079
- Write more clearly. How can l...?
- Why would you have a clown in your bed?

653
00:37:22,256 --> 00:37:24,918
- It would not be the first time.
- Yeah, I'm not surprised.

654
00:37:25,092 --> 00:37:27,492
- Write in capital letters.
- Why don't you write it?

655
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,096
I'm sorry, Khan.
We're gonna come back in one second.

656
00:37:30,264 --> 00:37:32,994
You dictate, I'll write.
And I will write like a human...

657
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,226
...and not like a small Pekingese dog.

658
00:37:35,403 --> 00:37:38,531
What are you doing, you madwoman?
You're destroying my apartment.

659
00:37:38,706 --> 00:37:40,970
I can't write from across the room.

660
00:37:41,142 --> 00:37:43,940
Well, you're not writing here.
Get back to your corner.

661
00:37:44,111 --> 00:37:45,100
I can't have you here.

662
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:48,737
- I'll be blocked. I'll be completely stuck.
- So go out the other side.

663
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:50,975
I've never been the other side.

664
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:55,151
Push, push. Push, push.

665
00:38:00,461 --> 00:38:02,588
Good. Better.

666
00:38:02,763 --> 00:38:05,891
You're still a fraction close.
Just... Just back off, just one...

667
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:07,557
Just... Just...

668
00:38:07,735 --> 00:38:09,202
There, fine, good.

669
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,860
Okay.

670
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,887
And I don't think those chords are right.

671
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,924
It has to sound different than the verse.

672
00:38:33,327 --> 00:38:35,318
What kind of different
did you have in mind?

673
00:38:35,496 --> 00:38:38,260
I don't know.
Something sadder, you know?

674
00:38:38,432 --> 00:38:41,663
And I still don't like my line
about "places in my mind."

675
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:45,033
- It's fine.
- Fine isn't good.

676
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:46,730
We only have time for fine.

677
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,341
I tell you what.
We'll change "places in my mind"...

678
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,910
...if I can keep the chord sequence
into the bridge.

679
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,512
This isn't a negotiation.

680
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:56,809
It's either right or wrong,
inspired or insipid.

681
00:38:56,984 --> 00:39:00,920
It's 4 in the morning. We're not writing the
last movement of the "Jupiter Symphony."

682
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:04,114
It's a song for someone who's last hit
was "Welcome to Bootytown."

683
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:05,588
Please, get back to work.

684
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,456
I still don't like it.

685
00:39:08,629 --> 00:39:11,291
And it's "Entering Bootytown."

686
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:15,134
And another thing,
the whole top section...

687
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:17,834
I mean, it's so close.
We're just not there yet.

688
00:39:18,005 --> 00:39:20,405
We just... We have to focus
and stay, you know...

689
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:23,168
...completely understanding
of what we're trying to say.

690
00:39:23,344 --> 00:39:26,404
Okay, you may now
start killing the next one.

691
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:34,316
<i>All I wanna do</i>
<i>Is find a way back into love</i>

692
00:39:37,892 --> 00:39:43,762
<i>I can't make it through</i>
<i>Without a way back into love</i>

693
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:51,665
You know, I'm tone-deaf.

694
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,758
Hey, what do you think of this?

695
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:19,297
Just keep writing.
Cora is leaving in an hour.

696
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:49,490
Listen, I was thinking that "corners"
was such a better word than "spaces."

697
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:52,860
For "in the mind." "The corners
of my mind," rather than "the spaces."

698
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:56,332
It just seems to have a better boundary
to it, you know?

699
00:40:56,504 --> 00:40:59,701
Should I speak to you
about this later? Okay.

700
00:41:09,016 --> 00:41:12,247
It sounds so good. I can't believe it.

701
00:41:12,419 --> 00:41:14,182
And now...

702
00:41:14,355 --> 00:41:15,822
...vocals.

703
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:19,619
No, you see, you have to sing
into the microphone. It won't follow you.

704
00:41:19,793 --> 00:41:22,057
- But I can't.
- It's a duet for a man and a woman.

705
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,753
We are as close as we've got.

706
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:27,594
Your headphones and a level. You look nice.
You should wear them all the time.

707
00:41:27,768 --> 00:41:30,066
How is that?

708
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,295
- Yes?
- Okay!

709
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,400
It's okay.

710
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,770
And...

711
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:41,414
..."Way Back Into Love." Take one.

712
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,846
Oh, God. I'm getting really nervous.

713
00:41:44,018 --> 00:41:46,282
You'll be fine.
Just use your normal nice voice...

714
00:41:46,453 --> 00:41:48,853
...that I've heard so much of
in the last three days.

715
00:41:49,023 --> 00:41:52,151
It's like my throat's closing up.
It's like anaphylactic.

716
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:54,590
It's fine. It's just a three-minute song.

717
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:03,800
<i>I've been living with a shadow overhead</i>

718
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:05,461
<i>I've been sleeping with a...</i>

719
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:08,437
Just a little bit louder.
This song is intended for humans.

720
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,339
"Way Back Into Love." Take two.

721
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:19,011
<i>I've been living with a shadow overhead</i>

722
00:42:19,186 --> 00:42:23,816
<i>I've been sleeping</i>
<i>With a cloud above my bed</i>

723
00:42:23,991 --> 00:42:27,188
<i>I've been lonely for so long</i>

724
00:42:28,229 --> 00:42:33,098
<i>Trapped in the past</i>
<i>I just can't seem to move on</i>

725
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:38,230
<i>I've been hiding all my hopes</i>
<i>And dreams away</i>

726
00:42:38,405 --> 00:42:43,308
<i>Just in case I ever need 'em</i>
<i>Again someday</i>

727
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,378
<i>I've been setting aside time</i>

728
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:52,380
<i>To clear a little space</i>
<i>In the corners of my mind</i>

729
00:42:53,454 --> 00:43:00,053
<i>All I wanna do</i>
<i>Is find a way back into love</i>

730
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:09,869
<i>I can't make it through</i>
<i>Without a way back into love</i>

731
00:43:10,371 --> 00:43:13,135
Hey, hey! Taxi! She's gonna have a baby!

732
00:43:13,307 --> 00:43:15,434
Hey, what if that were true?

733
00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:16,598
Another one.

734
00:43:44,738 --> 00:43:47,263
- Oh, my God. It's Cora.
- Okay, stay calm.

735
00:43:47,441 --> 00:43:49,909
- C, you remember Alex Fletcher.
- How are you, C?

736
00:43:50,077 --> 00:43:51,874
- Hi, Alex.
- Sophie Fisher, my lyricist.

737
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,014
Hi. Aspiring lyricist, actually.

738
00:43:54,181 --> 00:43:55,876
So Ray tells me you have a song.

739
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,853
We do. A little ditty. It's just a rough...

740
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,012
Yeah, go ahead, take it. Help yourself.

741
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,748
Oh, we're gonna do it now?

742
00:44:04,925 --> 00:44:08,452
Great, great. No time like the present.

743
00:44:08,629 --> 00:44:12,963
Very rough. Just put together
in my little studio. Both of us singing.

744
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:15,226
She's gonna hear my voice,
it's gonna ruin it.

745
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,391
It's gonna be fine.

746
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:24,369
Anyone see <i>Nattle of the '80s Has-Neens</i>
the other night?

747
00:44:24,545 --> 00:44:26,536
That Debbie Gibson,
she can take a punch.

748
00:44:32,386 --> 00:44:34,286
I didn't see it.

749
00:45:22,836 --> 00:45:25,896
This is the song I've been looking for.
I can't wait to work on it.

750
00:45:26,073 --> 00:45:27,870
Congratulations, guys. We gotta book.

751
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:30,874
Thank you so much.
Looking forward to working with you guys.

752
00:45:31,044 --> 00:45:32,170
Congratulations.

753
00:45:32,346 --> 00:45:33,745
- D Money!
- Let's go home.

754
00:45:33,914 --> 00:45:35,176
This way, folks.

755
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:38,011
It's unbelievable. We got the job.

756
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,049
I thank you. Thank you.

757
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,083
I thank you, I thank you...

758
00:45:48,195 --> 00:45:51,062
Yes? Chris, she loved it.

759
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,994
Unbelievable!

760
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,158
Definitely. Where are you?

761
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,098
Okay, got it. Got it.

762
00:45:57,271 --> 00:45:59,501
We're going to dinner. Come on.

763
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:05,911
To Sophie Fisher, the woman who paved
my way back to Knott's Berry Farm.

764
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,808
Gloria, I love your dress.

765
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:10,973
Oh, thank you.
It's nice to clean up after a day of work.

766
00:46:11,151 --> 00:46:12,277
Where do you work?

767
00:46:12,453 --> 00:46:14,819
I'm a therapist at Columbia-Presbyterian.

768
00:46:14,988 --> 00:46:17,388
I'm working on a study
examining the relationship...

769
00:46:17,558 --> 00:46:18,582
Oh, my God.

770
00:46:18,759 --> 00:46:21,250
That's a strike against us, right?
I mean...

771
00:46:21,428 --> 00:46:24,556
What is it? What?

772
00:46:24,731 --> 00:46:26,995
- Sloan.
- Sloan?

773
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:32,538
Mr. Cates, good evening.
How are you? Nice to see you.

774
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,537
I'd say about two minutes.

775
00:46:36,944 --> 00:46:39,606
- Hi, how you doing?
- Here it comes.

776
00:46:41,248 --> 00:46:42,909
Here's the thing...

777
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,130
Is she all right?

778
00:47:00,868 --> 00:47:04,099
Yeah, she always does this.
It's her way of working up an appetite.

779
00:47:04,271 --> 00:47:05,260
Hang on.

780
00:47:11,845 --> 00:47:13,813
Hello? Sophie?

781
00:47:13,981 --> 00:47:15,448
He's at the bar.

782
00:47:15,616 --> 00:47:18,380
I know. I know. I know.
I saw him. I saw him.

783
00:47:18,552 --> 00:47:21,680
He's not that great, you know.
I saw the beginnings of a bald patch.

784
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:25,188
- Why, come and have a look.
- Oh, he has a great head of hair.

785
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:26,656
Oh, God.

786
00:47:26,827 --> 00:47:28,988
I think I'll just stay in here
until he leaves.

787
00:47:29,162 --> 00:47:31,687
Maybe you could send in a salad
and an iced tea?

788
00:47:31,865 --> 00:47:35,096
Right. I'll get the waiter.
Would you like the dessert cart as well?

789
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,169
Look, this is ridiculous.

790
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:40,366
I've been dreaming
about confronting him too.

791
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:43,510
I had a speech prepared for over a year.

792
00:47:44,545 --> 00:47:46,604
Would you like to hear it?

793
00:47:47,414 --> 00:47:49,279
Very, very much.

794
00:47:50,551 --> 00:47:52,781
Hello there. Good evening.

795
00:47:55,822 --> 00:48:00,452
Sloan, even though Sally Michaels
only lives on paper...

796
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,060
...I live in the world.

797
00:48:02,229 --> 00:48:05,426
And I can never forgive you
for using me as raw material...

798
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,624
...to create a fictional monster.

799
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:10,167
Sally Michaels
is my own personal ghost...

800
00:48:10,337 --> 00:48:13,795
...a shadow hanging over each phone call
and cup of iced tea.

801
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:18,138
And one cold day, when age
has robbed your mind of its fertile phrases...

802
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:22,078
...and your hand of its dexterity, all
the success won't be able to shield you...

803
00:48:22,249 --> 00:48:24,843
...from the pain you've caused
and the shame you deserve.

804
00:48:25,018 --> 00:48:26,918
Or something like that.

805
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:29,921
But now I know
I could never actually say it to him.

806
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:33,355
No. You have to say that. You have
to say that. You have to say it now.

807
00:48:33,527 --> 00:48:35,927
Now is the perfect time.
You're on top of the world.

808
00:48:36,096 --> 00:48:38,496
You wrote a song
for the biggest act in the universe.

809
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:39,962
- But I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

810
00:48:40,133 --> 00:48:42,795
People wait to see an ex-lover
when things are going well.

811
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:45,734
It never happens.
You can make relationship history here.

812
00:48:45,906 --> 00:48:49,239
But I can't. I mean, look at me.
I haven't showered in days.

813
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:52,674
I'm covered in songwriting grime.
The helicopter flew bugs in my teeth.

814
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,940
Yes, yes, yes. You are a little mangy.

815
00:48:57,784 --> 00:49:00,514
Wait. Wait. Stay.

816
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:08,728
Sorry, Gloria.
Can I ask you a great favor?

817
00:49:08,895 --> 00:49:12,387
Could you accompany me
to the ladies' room?

818
00:49:14,334 --> 00:49:16,859
He's a good guy. Go ahead.

819
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:20,165
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Sure. Be right back.

820
00:49:28,649 --> 00:49:31,482
- That's fantastic.
- You look great.

821
00:49:31,652 --> 00:49:34,849
Eleven years of therapy and I finally
help someone. Good luck, honey.

822
00:49:35,022 --> 00:49:36,011
Thank you so much.

823
00:49:36,189 --> 00:49:38,680
Yes, thank you. Thank you, doctor.

824
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:40,348
It doesn't really fit.

825
00:49:40,527 --> 00:49:42,927
- No, on the contrary. It fits you perfectly.
- Really?

826
00:49:43,096 --> 00:49:45,656
I'm not saying you should go
to confession like that...

827
00:49:45,832 --> 00:49:48,232
...but for what you're about to do,
it's perfect.

828
00:49:49,703 --> 00:49:51,261
Okay. Are you ready?

829
00:49:51,972 --> 00:49:54,805
I think I'm developing
a sudden coronary blockage.

830
00:49:54,975 --> 00:49:56,374
Those pass very quickly, okay?

831
00:49:56,543 --> 00:49:58,272
Shortness of breath. Blurred vision.

832
00:49:58,445 --> 00:49:59,912
- You're fine.
- Scurvy?

833
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:02,706
You're beautiful. No, it's fine.

834
00:50:02,883 --> 00:50:05,579
"I don't write bestsellers
because I despise humanity."

835
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:10,451
And I said, "No, John, you don't write
bestsellers because the feeling is mutual."

836
00:50:11,658 --> 00:50:14,991
Should I have stopped? Should
I have stopped right there? Was it over?

837
00:50:15,162 --> 00:50:19,565
Hi. Sophie. My God, Sophie.

838
00:50:20,701 --> 00:50:22,896
How are you?

839
00:50:25,372 --> 00:50:27,033
I'm fine, yeah.

840
00:50:27,207 --> 00:50:29,732
Good, it's great to see you.

841
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:34,244
- Alex Fletcher. Hi, how are you?
- Hey, Alex. Sloan Cates. How are you?

842
00:50:34,414 --> 00:50:38,612
Well, it's been an eternity.
You look incredible.

843
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,881
Then you were always
mysteriously seductive, weren't you?

844
00:50:43,657 --> 00:50:46,490
She is writing a song for Cora Corman.

845
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:51,363
What? No. Wait. You're a songwriter?

846
00:50:51,531 --> 00:50:54,091
L... I wrote...

847
00:50:54,267 --> 00:50:56,292
Brilliant lyrics. Fantastic lyrics.

848
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,132
A lot of people
are talking about them, actually.

849
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,866
I had a pen, a paper and wrote...

850
00:51:04,444 --> 00:51:08,847
Sloan, the thing is, even though
Sally Michaels only lives on paper...

851
00:51:09,015 --> 00:51:10,642
...Sophie lives in the real world.

852
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,045
She can never forgive you...

853
00:51:12,219 --> 00:51:14,744
- Mr. Cates, your table's ready.
- Great, thanks, Stefan.

854
00:51:14,921 --> 00:51:18,152
Listen, I'll be right there, guys. I'm sorry.

855
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:21,055
They're throwing
this little dinner thing for me.

856
00:51:21,228 --> 00:51:24,197
It's crazy how lavish people get
no matter how cheap they are...

857
00:51:24,364 --> 00:51:26,389
...when Hollywood comes calling.
- Hollywood.

858
00:51:26,566 --> 00:51:29,262
I've sold out. They're making a film
out of <i>Sally Michaels.</i>

859
00:51:29,436 --> 00:51:30,425
- Really?
- Yeah.

860
00:51:30,604 --> 00:51:32,799
It's been crazy. I wrote the script.

861
00:51:32,973 --> 00:51:35,373
We're seeing actresses.
It's been... You know.

862
00:51:36,276 --> 00:51:39,643
But listen, it's great seeing you.
Let's get together, okay?

863
00:51:42,115 --> 00:51:43,912
Take care of yourself.

864
00:51:46,253 --> 00:51:48,084
Take care, Allen.

865
00:51:52,893 --> 00:51:54,360
Well...

866
00:51:54,995 --> 00:51:57,589
...must feel good to get that over with.

867
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,032
I just wanna go home.

868
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,763
Okay. Okay. Okay.

869
00:52:05,939 --> 00:52:09,102
Hang on. Just hang on one second.
One second.

870
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:12,105
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry to bother you.

871
00:52:12,279 --> 00:52:15,612
It would mean the world if you'd
just let her say what she came to say.

872
00:52:15,782 --> 00:52:17,579
I know what she came here to say, okay?

873
00:52:17,751 --> 00:52:20,584
Some sad little story
about how I ruined her life...

874
00:52:20,754 --> 00:52:22,221
...while the truth is...

875
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:28,026
...that she seduced me
so that I'd help get her published, okay?

876
00:52:28,195 --> 00:52:31,187
Come on. You were engaged
and you never even told her.

877
00:52:31,698 --> 00:52:33,962
I'd say we're done talking.

878
00:52:34,134 --> 00:52:35,567
Bye-bye.

879
00:52:38,772 --> 00:52:41,138
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

880
00:52:41,308 --> 00:52:43,208
<i>Wait.</i>

881
00:52:45,011 --> 00:52:48,037
Do me a favor.
Why don't you just shove off?

882
00:52:48,215 --> 00:52:51,707
I appreciate your request,
but why don't you just shove off?

883
00:52:51,885 --> 00:52:55,082
- Take it easy, my friend.
- I don't believe I will take it easy.

884
00:52:56,122 --> 00:52:57,885
All right. All right!

885
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:02,822
Don't hurt his hair.
He's working Adventureland this weekend.

886
00:53:02,996 --> 00:53:05,556
I'm giving up. My face is in the butter.

887
00:53:09,469 --> 00:53:11,027
Thank you.

888
00:53:11,805 --> 00:53:13,466
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

889
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,235
It's just my PoP hip. It comes from years
of doing our patented dance move.

890
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:19,503
My God, I've suffered for my art.

891
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:21,874
No, the thing that really hurts
is my upper gum.

892
00:53:22,048 --> 00:53:24,380
I think I may have impaled myself
on a dinner roll.

893
00:53:24,551 --> 00:53:27,486
Good thing they didn't have breadsticks.
I could've lost an eye.

894
00:53:27,654 --> 00:53:29,679
Well, you should get some ice on that.

895
00:53:29,856 --> 00:53:32,017
Only if it's attached to some whiskey.

896
00:53:32,192 --> 00:53:35,355
Oh, God. I can't believe
you convinced me to do that.

897
00:53:35,528 --> 00:53:38,622
Now I'm more of a joke to him than ever.

898
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:39,787
And to top it off...

899
00:53:40,233 --> 00:53:43,600
...l'll have my own personal nightmare
playing on 3000 screens.

900
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:46,500
And you know what the worst part is?

901
00:53:46,673 --> 00:53:48,368
You stole some poor woman's dress?

902
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:53,171
The worst part is that
he still has some kind of power over me.

903
00:53:53,346 --> 00:53:55,371
I still care what he thinks.

904
00:53:55,548 --> 00:53:57,914
I'm sorry, but how?

905
00:53:58,084 --> 00:54:02,544
How can that possibly be?
The guy is a jerk.

906
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,620
Well, that's easy for you to say, but...

907
00:54:05,792 --> 00:54:08,852
No. He is a jerk. He is a jerk.
It's not a question. He is a jerk.

908
00:54:09,029 --> 00:54:12,157
No, he is, he's a jerk. He's a jerk.
Okay, here's what I think.

909
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:15,859
I think that the truth is that you are terrified
of losing Sally Michaels...

910
00:54:16,036 --> 00:54:20,473
...because you'd have nothing to hide behind
and you'd have to stand on your own feet.

911
00:54:23,243 --> 00:54:27,236
Wow. I didn't see that coming.

912
00:54:27,647 --> 00:54:29,239
No. Well...

913
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:31,316
...I have amazing insight.

914
00:54:31,484 --> 00:54:34,248
I would use it on myself,
only I don't have any problems.

915
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,520
And I will tell you my other insight.

916
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:41,525
I think you are way too talented
and gifted...

917
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:45,995
...and unusual to let anyone
keep you from standing.

918
00:54:50,403 --> 00:54:53,133
That's wonderfully sensitive, Alex.

919
00:54:53,306 --> 00:54:56,036
Especially from a man
who wears such tight pants.

920
00:54:56,576 --> 00:54:59,067
It forces all the blood to my heart.

921
00:55:08,151 --> 00:55:09,743
Listen.

922
00:55:10,287 --> 00:55:13,188
You were amazing tonight.

923
00:55:13,991 --> 00:55:15,356
As were you.

924
00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:18,187
The few syllables you got out
were absolutely devastating.

925
00:55:23,934 --> 00:55:25,629
Does this feel any better?

926
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:28,264
It would if it was on the right side.

927
00:55:41,118 --> 00:55:42,779
And that...

928
00:55:44,287 --> 00:55:46,255
...felt much better.

929
00:56:44,014 --> 00:56:46,778
- Hello? Hello?
<i>- Hey, buddy.</i>

930
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:48,542
How's my hit songwriter?

931
00:56:49,186 --> 00:56:50,551
Hang on. Just... Just hang on.

932
00:56:51,955 --> 00:56:55,118
You don't sound right.
Maybe it's the connect... Hello?

933
00:56:55,859 --> 00:56:57,690
I have a strange situation here.

934
00:56:57,861 --> 00:57:00,091
Oh, you've got a strange situation?

935
00:57:00,263 --> 00:57:04,563
I'm at Beth's soccer game with my ex-wife
who's here with my ex-gardener.

936
00:57:04,734 --> 00:57:06,827
They came on a riding mower.

937
00:57:07,003 --> 00:57:08,470
I slept with Sophie.

938
00:57:08,638 --> 00:57:11,402
You slept with Sophie?

939
00:57:11,575 --> 00:57:15,011
Remember your blood pressure.
You're a tall man. You need all you can get.

940
00:57:15,178 --> 00:57:18,238
Are you out of your mind?
Alex, this is terrible.

941
00:57:18,415 --> 00:57:22,476
Unless, of course, you're happy about it,
and then I couldn't be more pleased for you.

942
00:57:22,652 --> 00:57:24,643
- Should we do pros and cons?
<i>- Not necessary.</i>

943
00:57:26,256 --> 00:57:28,656
- I think she's up. I gotta go.
<i>- We got a show today.</i>

944
00:57:28,825 --> 00:57:31,225
Two o'clock. I'm gonna pick you up
in a little while.

945
00:57:31,394 --> 00:57:34,989
<i>I want you to wear the white shirt</i>
<i>with the fan-friendly pants.</i>

946
00:57:35,165 --> 00:57:37,690
Too much. Too much.
Hanging up on you. Hanging up.

947
00:57:38,568 --> 00:57:39,557
Good morning.

948
00:57:40,837 --> 00:57:43,533
- Hi.
- That was Chris just checking in.

949
00:57:44,341 --> 00:57:48,038
So I'm gonna help clean up a little bit...

950
00:57:48,211 --> 00:57:50,543
...seeing as we don't
have any work today.

951
00:57:50,714 --> 00:57:52,909
Right. Fine. Thank you. Very nice of you.

952
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:56,519
I would obviously invite you to stay,
it's just that I have a show today.

953
00:57:57,187 --> 00:57:59,348
- Oh, really?
- Oh, yes. A big one.

954
00:57:59,523 --> 00:58:01,923
I'm headlining
at Adventureland Amusement Park:

955
00:58:02,092 --> 00:58:04,117
Long Island's family fun center.

956
00:58:04,294 --> 00:58:06,762
Biggest outdoor amusement center
east of Rye Playland.

957
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:09,956
- You have my permission to be impressed.
- Sounds great.

958
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:12,658
- Okay.
- Yeah.

959
00:58:12,836 --> 00:58:14,963
- So.
- So.

960
00:58:16,806 --> 00:58:18,296
I mean, you...

961
00:58:20,377 --> 00:58:22,242
You could come.

962
00:58:30,921 --> 00:58:33,822
<i>I said I wasn't gonna lose my head</i>

963
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:38,654
<i>- Nut then pop goes my heart</i>
<i>- Pop goes my heart</i>

964
00:58:38,828 --> 00:58:41,353
<i>I wasn't gonna fall in love again</i>

965
00:58:41,531 --> 00:58:45,433
<i>- Nut then pop goes my heart</i>
<i>- Pop goes my heart</i>

966
00:58:45,602 --> 00:58:50,801
<i>And I just can't let you go</i>

967
00:58:50,974 --> 00:58:53,966
<i>I can't lose this feeling</i>

968
00:58:56,346 --> 00:58:58,143
Okay. Let's hear everyone clapping.

969
00:58:59,849 --> 00:59:04,081
Hey, come on. These guys over here on line
at the Little Dipper, let's hear you clapping.

970
00:59:06,923 --> 00:59:08,788
Don't... Don't if you don't want to.

971
00:59:08,959 --> 00:59:11,985
<i>A twist of fate makes life worthwhile</i>

972
00:59:12,162 --> 00:59:17,122
<i>You are gold and silver</i>

973
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,564
<i>I said I wasn't gonna lose my head</i>

974
00:59:19,736 --> 00:59:23,263
<i>- Nut then pop goes my heart</i>
<i>- Pop goes my heart</i>

975
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:29,276
<i>And I just can't let you go</i>

976
00:59:34,184 --> 00:59:38,416
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Adventureland. Thank you.

977
00:59:39,556 --> 00:59:41,547
Thank you.

978
00:59:42,759 --> 00:59:45,193
That was great. That was great.

979
00:59:45,362 --> 00:59:47,421
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

980
00:59:47,597 --> 00:59:49,997
Good show.
All right, you gotta do the encore.

981
00:59:50,867 --> 00:59:54,030
- Do I really have to?
- It's in the contract.

982
00:59:54,204 --> 00:59:56,798
Wanna do "Meaningless Kiss"
or "Dance With Me Tonight"?

983
00:59:57,574 --> 00:59:59,508
This is embarrassing. They don't want it.

984
00:59:59,676 --> 01:00:02,474
No, it's not.
These songs, they're fantastic.

985
01:00:03,179 --> 01:00:05,306
I mean, I've never heard
most of them before...

986
01:00:05,482 --> 01:00:09,384
...but they're full of wonderful
melodic surprises and they're catchy...

987
01:00:09,552 --> 01:00:12,146
...and they're making people happy
and they're just good.

988
01:00:12,322 --> 01:00:14,688
So you should be incredibly proud
to sing them.

989
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:19,528
You're not just saying that
because you've been on the wave ride?

990
01:00:19,696 --> 01:00:22,665
They're good, really good.

991
01:00:26,703 --> 01:00:30,070
Okay, then.
"Dance With Me Tonight," please.

992
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,368
It's not often one man
gets to say that to another with such joy.

993
01:00:38,815 --> 01:00:40,442
Thank you.

994
01:00:42,619 --> 01:00:45,247
Okay. PoP face.

995
01:00:55,999 --> 01:00:57,899
<i>Thank you.</i>

996
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:08,177
<i>It's been so long</i>

997
01:01:08,345 --> 01:01:11,143
<i>Since I've known right from wrong</i>

998
01:01:11,314 --> 01:01:13,111
<i>Got no job</i>

999
01:01:13,283 --> 01:01:16,719
<i>Sometimes I just sit down and sob</i>

1000
01:01:16,886 --> 01:01:21,949
<i>Wondering if anything will go right</i>

1001
01:01:23,526 --> 01:01:27,394
<i>Or will you dance with me tonight</i>

1002
01:01:27,564 --> 01:01:29,498
<i>When the sun departs</i>

1003
01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:32,829
<i>I feel a hole down in my heart</i>

1004
01:01:33,002 --> 01:01:34,435
<i>Put on some shoes</i>

1005
01:01:34,604 --> 01:01:38,563
<i>Come down here and listen to the blues</i>

1006
01:01:38,742 --> 01:01:44,078
<i>Wondering if anything will go right</i>

1007
01:01:45,348 --> 01:01:48,909
<i>Or will you dance with me tonight</i>

1008
01:01:49,085 --> 01:01:51,519
<i>I'm looking at you</i>

1009
01:01:51,688 --> 01:01:53,986
<i>You're looking at me</i>

1010
01:01:54,157 --> 01:01:57,388
<i>We're the only two off the dance floor</i>

1011
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,790
<i>Do you see what I see?</i>

1012
01:01:59,963 --> 01:02:02,454
<i>Two broken lives</i>

1013
01:02:02,632 --> 01:02:04,896
<i>Working in harmony</i>

1014
01:02:05,068 --> 01:02:07,764
<i>Might make for a decent time</i>

1015
01:02:07,937 --> 01:02:10,030
<i>So get up and dance with me</i>

1016
01:02:12,041 --> 01:02:14,339
It was a great show.
You should be very pleased.

1017
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:16,103
How much money did we make?

1018
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:19,271
I don't talk business in front of a non-client.
You know that.

1019
01:02:19,449 --> 01:02:22,009
Actually, I'm thinking
about signing with you.

1020
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:26,282
Well, well, thank you, Sophie.
That's... That's terrific.

1021
01:02:26,456 --> 01:02:30,392
In that case, I don't think it's right
to talk about one client's business affairs...

1022
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,154
...in front of another client.
I'm discreet that way.

1023
01:02:33,329 --> 01:02:36,389
You don't know how much money
we made, do you?

1024
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,365
I have a ballpark figure.

1025
01:02:38,535 --> 01:02:40,059
Is it enough for a nice dinner?

1026
01:02:40,236 --> 01:02:43,069
Dinner. I'm supposed to go
to Rhonda's for dinner. I'm late.

1027
01:02:43,239 --> 01:02:45,070
Oh, God, help.

1028
01:02:45,241 --> 01:02:49,041
You know, she wouldn't yell at me
if you came.

1029
01:02:51,714 --> 01:02:53,477
Oh, very well.

1030
01:02:56,619 --> 01:02:58,450
I can't go.

1031
01:03:03,693 --> 01:03:06,594
I'm losing my mind.
You've got me frazzled.

1032
01:03:07,997 --> 01:03:11,694
- Oh, there you go. You're gonna love these.
- Thank you. That's plenty. Honestly.

1033
01:03:11,868 --> 01:03:14,564
Trust me, you're gonna want
even more than that. Say when.

1034
01:03:14,737 --> 01:03:18,002
When, when, when. Thank you.
Thank you. That's plenty. Thank you.

1035
01:03:18,174 --> 01:03:19,573
- One more. Trust me.
- No.

1036
01:03:19,742 --> 01:03:22,108
Listen, now, I don't wanna be
presumptuous...

1037
01:03:22,278 --> 01:03:25,145
...but I'm about to open
a new Weight-Not in Boca...

1038
01:03:25,315 --> 01:03:27,783
...and I was wondering
if maybe you'd like to perform.

1039
01:03:27,951 --> 01:03:31,011
Sounds wonderful. I performed
at a fat farm once. They loved me.

1040
01:03:31,187 --> 01:03:33,587
I threw out treats from the stage.
They went crazy.

1041
01:03:33,756 --> 01:03:35,223
It was like a dietetic Altamont.

1042
01:03:37,393 --> 01:03:38,382
That's funny.

1043
01:03:38,561 --> 01:03:41,894
- Honey, no cell phones at the table.
- Could be Jessie about the meeting.

1044
01:03:42,065 --> 01:03:45,626
If we break the rules, what'll the kids think?
Don't. Sorry, Alex. Very rude.

1045
01:03:45,802 --> 01:03:48,794
Weirdo, is there a way
we could go to the Cora show?

1046
01:03:48,972 --> 01:03:51,167
- That would be so cool.
- We could work that out.

1047
01:03:51,341 --> 01:03:53,866
I believe we can.
I believe we've become close friends.

1048
01:03:54,043 --> 01:03:55,738
Don't bug him with stuff like that.

1049
01:03:55,912 --> 01:03:59,245
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Apologies.
I know the rules. Turn it off.

1050
01:03:59,415 --> 01:04:02,077
Oh, no, honey. You go right ahead.
You're a guest.

1051
01:04:02,252 --> 01:04:05,153
You sure? You want me
to call Jessie back while I'm...?

1052
01:04:05,655 --> 01:04:06,952
I'll be very quick.

1053
01:04:07,123 --> 01:04:09,887
Chris, yes? Say that again.
Cora's people what?

1054
01:04:10,059 --> 01:04:11,754
What? Is it about the song?

1055
01:04:12,128 --> 01:04:13,220
Really?

1056
01:04:13,396 --> 01:04:14,829
- What does he say?
- It's Sophie.

1057
01:04:15,565 --> 01:04:17,055
Really?

1058
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,964
Okay. Okay, got it.

1059
01:04:20,503 --> 01:04:21,970
Cora is back in town tomorrow...

1060
01:04:22,138 --> 01:04:25,630
...and wants to meet us at her studio
to work on the song.

1061
01:04:25,808 --> 01:04:28,902
And she wants to know
if we like wheatgrass.

1062
01:04:29,078 --> 01:04:31,012
- Sounds ominous.
- Are you worried?

1063
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:34,672
- Well, I don't... You know, yeah.
- Lf you're not worried, I'm not worried.

1064
01:04:34,851 --> 01:04:38,309
You've got your worried eyes.
You look like a little worried doggy.

1065
01:04:48,831 --> 01:04:51,800
Sophie, bring those dishes in here, hon.

1066
01:04:56,806 --> 01:04:59,934
Okay, honey. You lead, I'll follow.

1067
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,475
- There you go. There you go.
- What?

1068
01:05:07,016 --> 01:05:08,608
Nothing. Just looking.

1069
01:05:10,353 --> 01:05:12,617
What? What? What, what, what?

1070
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:16,384
- Well, look. As your older sister...
- Seven years older.

1071
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:17,924
Now, that's just uncalled for.

1072
01:05:18,094 --> 01:05:20,688
Why do you do that?
It just... It hurts, you know?

1073
01:05:20,863 --> 01:05:24,924
Look. I like Alex, you know.
I mean, he's Alex Fletcher. So hot.

1074
01:05:25,101 --> 01:05:26,500
And he ate my mashed potatoes.

1075
01:05:26,669 --> 01:05:28,261
Yes. It was a magical evening.

1076
01:05:28,438 --> 01:05:30,633
But look, hon, you don't fall a lot.

1077
01:05:30,807 --> 01:05:34,334
And I've seen the way you look at him,
so if you are falling for him...

1078
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:38,002
...just please, please make sure
he's passionate about you.

1079
01:05:38,181 --> 01:05:42,515
Well, you know, I mean, I'm not falling.
We're just working together, you know?

1080
01:05:42,685 --> 01:05:46,382
And besides, the one time we slept
together, it's been totally professional.

1081
01:05:46,556 --> 01:05:48,023
- You did not.
- I did.

1082
01:05:48,191 --> 01:05:50,091
You slept with Alex Fletcher?

1083
01:05:50,259 --> 01:05:51,487
Oh, my God.

1084
01:05:52,662 --> 01:05:54,323
Don't worry about it, all right?

1085
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:01,830
Besides, you know,
how do you know who's passionate?

1086
01:06:03,373 --> 01:06:07,139
You know, I think you...
I think you just see it in their eyes.

1087
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:09,904
And you feel it in their touch.

1088
01:06:10,313 --> 01:06:13,874
In Gary's case, it was when he said
to his mother, "I'm marrying her anyway."

1089
01:06:14,584 --> 01:06:16,211
God, I hate her.

1090
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:20,787
I don't know. I think it's just
when they do something extraordinary.

1091
01:06:21,724 --> 01:06:24,249
Soph, just be careful, okay?

1092
01:06:24,427 --> 01:06:25,894
Okay.

1093
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:35,393
And bigger. And bigger. And bigger.

1094
01:06:37,273 --> 01:06:39,104
With claps, and:

1095
01:06:41,177 --> 01:06:44,078
Ready to spin. And:

1096
01:06:50,186 --> 01:06:52,746
Well, that was fun.

1097
01:06:52,922 --> 01:06:55,186
It was, it was, it was.
Except for those potatoes.

1098
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:57,724
What I imagine eating insulation
would taste like.

1099
01:06:59,095 --> 01:07:01,791
So Cora tomorrow?

1100
01:07:01,964 --> 01:07:05,297
Yes, tomorrow, 10:00,
her studio, 19th Street.

1101
01:07:06,235 --> 01:07:09,227
- Should I meet you there?
- That would be fine.

1102
01:07:09,405 --> 01:07:11,168
Although I was gonna take a cab.

1103
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:13,535
And seeing as I live
further uptown than you...

1104
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:15,974
...I could, theoretically, pick you up.

1105
01:07:16,579 --> 01:07:20,071
You could if I was on the street
at, say, like, 9:40.

1106
01:07:20,249 --> 01:07:23,275
I would probably see you, depending
how brightly you were dressed.

1107
01:07:23,453 --> 01:07:25,353
I'd wear orange so you couldn't miss me.

1108
01:07:25,521 --> 01:07:27,785
You could get some road work done
while you wait.

1109
01:07:33,696 --> 01:07:37,223
Well, goodbye and thank you.
Thank you very much for this. I enjoyed it.

1110
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:41,029
- And thank you for your support today.
- Thank you. Today was great.

1111
01:07:42,105 --> 01:07:44,164
- It was.
- Okay. Bye.

1112
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:45,898
Goodbye.

1113
01:07:53,583 --> 01:07:54,607
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1114
01:08:26,983 --> 01:08:30,441
I want you to hear the new intro
to "Way Back Into Love."

1115
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:31,848
So imagine this:

1116
01:08:32,021 --> 01:08:34,489
Instead of just starting the song
with the piano...

1117
01:08:34,657 --> 01:08:39,094
...we get this heavy Indian thing going,
very rhythmic.

1118
01:08:42,532 --> 01:08:46,525
Derek, give me a beat:
Steamy and sticky.

1119
01:08:53,176 --> 01:08:56,737
<i>Way back into love</i>

1120
01:08:56,913 --> 01:09:01,145
<i>She's been living</i>
<i>With a shadow overhead</i>

1121
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:09,350
<i>She's been sleeping</i>
<i>With a cloud above her bed</i>

1122
01:09:12,762 --> 01:09:15,322
<i>Go Cora, go Cora</i>

1123
01:09:16,666 --> 01:09:22,104
<i>Cora Corman and Alex Fletcher</i>
<i>Got a new song that's gonna getcha</i>

1124
01:09:22,271 --> 01:09:25,832
<i>Way back into love</i>

1125
01:09:26,008 --> 01:09:29,774
<i>Way back into love</i>

1126
01:09:31,147 --> 01:09:34,742
<i>Way back into love</i>

1127
01:09:37,787 --> 01:09:41,382
You know, I think that I will get
some wheatgrass after all.

1128
01:09:43,659 --> 01:09:46,355
- You don't like it?
- No. No, no, no, it's not that.

1129
01:09:46,529 --> 01:09:48,963
She had her eye on that wheatgrass
since we came in.

1130
01:09:49,131 --> 01:09:51,224
What you're doing,
that thing there, is great.

1131
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,699
It's steamy and it's sticky, you know.

1132
01:09:54,871 --> 01:09:57,897
Which is... One is normally enough,
but the combo's just amazing.

1133
01:09:58,074 --> 01:09:59,507
C, time for the press shoot.

1134
01:10:00,009 --> 01:10:01,806
I really like what we came up with.

1135
01:10:02,511 --> 01:10:05,810
Oh, and add another verse.
It doesn't feel like the song ends yet.

1136
01:10:05,982 --> 01:10:08,143
Another verse? Right.
That would be an honor, C.

1137
01:10:08,317 --> 01:10:11,081
I'm having a little pre-recording session
party at my place.

1138
01:10:11,254 --> 01:10:13,279
I want you both to come.

1139
01:10:13,856 --> 01:10:14,982
Great.

1140
01:10:15,157 --> 01:10:18,058
I think though, that...
That there... But wait...

1141
01:10:18,261 --> 01:10:20,161
Cheers. Thanks a lot, Ray.

1142
01:10:20,329 --> 01:10:22,797
Thanks, Derek. Nice one.

1143
01:10:22,965 --> 01:10:25,525
Don't speak. Don't say anything.

1144
01:10:27,536 --> 01:10:31,370
You didn't actually like that orgasm
set to the <i>Gandhi</i> soundtrack, did you?

1145
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:34,566
Well, I thought it was,
you know, horrible.

1146
01:10:34,744 --> 01:10:38,805
I mean, it simultaneously destroyed
two musical cultures in under a minute.

1147
01:10:38,981 --> 01:10:40,107
We have to tell her.

1148
01:10:40,283 --> 01:10:41,773
No, no. I don't think we do.

1149
01:10:41,951 --> 01:10:44,181
Honestly, if she wants to dance,
let her dance.

1150
01:10:44,353 --> 01:10:47,413
I don't understand. Wait. I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

1151
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:51,890
Your heroes, the Beatles, Smokey,
they would never let this happen.

1152
01:10:52,061 --> 01:10:54,621
That's a completely different thing.
They were geniuses.

1153
01:10:54,797 --> 01:10:57,391
They wrote dinner. I write dessert.

1154
01:10:57,566 --> 01:10:59,397
No. You're better than dessert.

1155
01:10:59,568 --> 01:11:02,128
That's why I'm gonna tell her
what I think at the party.

1156
01:11:02,305 --> 01:11:04,068
- You are not gonna do that.
- Yes, I am.

1157
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:05,537
- No, you are not.
- Yes, I am.

1158
01:11:05,708 --> 01:11:07,801
In that case, you are no longer invited.

1159
01:11:07,977 --> 01:11:10,275
What? She invited me.

1160
01:11:10,446 --> 01:11:11,936
She invited us, as a team.

1161
01:11:12,114 --> 01:11:14,878
Now that we disagree,
we no longer present a united front...

1162
01:11:15,051 --> 01:11:17,849
...and are thus un-teamed
for the purposes of the invitation.

1163
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:19,009
So are you going?

1164
01:11:19,188 --> 01:11:22,089
- I might. I don't wanna be rude.
- I don't wanna be rude either.

1165
01:11:22,258 --> 01:11:24,317
You don't think that telling the hostess...

1166
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:27,121
...that she's destroyed
two musical cultures is rude?

1167
01:11:27,296 --> 01:11:28,888
I'm enrolling you in charm school.

1168
01:11:29,065 --> 01:11:31,693
I have to say what I think.
I can't work this way.

1169
01:11:31,867 --> 01:11:34,768
You can't work this way?
You've been a songwriter for six days.

1170
01:11:34,937 --> 01:11:36,700
God created the universe in six days.

1171
01:11:36,872 --> 01:11:41,104
And he never had a hit. Okay, he did.
He had "He's Got the Whole World in..."

1172
01:11:41,277 --> 01:11:42,767
I'm going to the party.

1173
01:11:42,945 --> 01:11:46,005
You are not going to the party.
You, young lady, are grounded.

1174
01:11:46,182 --> 01:11:48,412
You're grounded. Come back here.

1175
01:11:48,584 --> 01:11:51,917
- Please. I'm a little bit desperate. Please.
- I'll see you there.

1176
01:11:52,088 --> 01:11:55,956
You won't. You won't because
you're not invited. They won't let you in.

1177
01:12:10,373 --> 01:12:12,534
- Hey, Ray.
- Alex, my man.

1178
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:14,972
- How are you?
- I'm good, man. How you doing?

1179
01:12:15,144 --> 01:12:16,406
So is Sophie here?

1180
01:12:16,579 --> 01:12:19,173
You know what?
I haven't seen her. Yeah.

1181
01:12:19,348 --> 01:12:20,713
- Chris?
- Who?

1182
01:12:20,883 --> 01:12:23,113
- You know, my manager.
- I'm sorry. Have fun.

1183
01:12:23,285 --> 01:12:26,413
- Yeah.
- Hey, Michelle. Good to see you, babe.

1184
01:12:26,589 --> 01:12:27,578
Hey, how's it going?

1185
01:12:32,528 --> 01:12:34,393
Hey, Ray, what's up, man?

1186
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:36,557
How's it going?

1187
01:13:02,024 --> 01:13:03,013
Hey.

1188
01:13:03,192 --> 01:13:04,523
- Where's Sophie?
- Hang on.

1189
01:13:05,127 --> 01:13:08,790
Hang on. God, she's here. Please
don't let her through. Don't let her through.

1190
01:13:08,964 --> 01:13:11,728
We cannot let her talk to Cora.
She's gonna ruin everything.

1191
01:13:11,901 --> 01:13:13,630
- Who?
- Sophie. She hates the song.

1192
01:13:13,803 --> 01:13:16,294
- She hates the song you wrote?
- Yes. She hates it.

1193
01:13:16,472 --> 01:13:19,669
But she wrote the song.
Why does she hate it?

1194
01:13:19,842 --> 01:13:22,276
We had a little disagreement.

1195
01:13:22,445 --> 01:13:24,037
Hi there, Soph, how are you?

1196
01:13:24,213 --> 01:13:26,443
- Hey, Sophie.
- Good evening.

1197
01:13:26,615 --> 01:13:29,448
So you brought something,
did you, Sophie?

1198
01:13:29,618 --> 01:13:32,416
Yes. My mother told me,
"Never go to a party empty-handed"...

1199
01:13:32,588 --> 01:13:37,048
...so I went to the Zen Eatery and got
a selection of cookies. No, thank you.

1200
01:13:37,226 --> 01:13:38,887
Nirvana Nougat.

1201
01:13:43,666 --> 01:13:45,827
Hey. It's my favorite writers.

1202
01:13:46,001 --> 01:13:47,332
Hi, C. How are you?

1203
01:13:47,503 --> 01:13:49,494
We brought you some cookies,
from all of us.

1204
01:13:50,072 --> 01:13:52,336
Thank you. Derek.

1205
01:13:52,508 --> 01:13:54,271
Cora, I really wanted to talk to you...

1206
01:13:54,443 --> 01:13:56,911
About the fact that
we're gonna have to leave early...

1207
01:13:57,079 --> 01:13:59,741
...to finish this song
which has become important to us...

1208
01:13:59,915 --> 01:14:01,906
...in both an artistic and spiritual sense.

1209
01:14:02,084 --> 01:14:04,314
You can't leave yet. Come see the house.

1210
01:14:04,487 --> 01:14:07,615
I wanna show you the roof. It's upstairs.

1211
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:09,985
Do you know...? Well...

1212
01:14:12,728 --> 01:14:17,165
Cora, I definitely see how much
you've thought about the song and...

1213
01:14:17,333 --> 01:14:20,666
Great roof. In a very interesting place
as well, right at the top...

1214
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:24,294
- Sophie was about to say something.
- Was she? I don't think she was. No.

1215
01:14:24,473 --> 01:14:27,499
She looks like she's about
to say something, then just... clams up.

1216
01:14:27,676 --> 01:14:32,079
What I wanted to say is that I appreciate
that you're bringing thought to the music...

1217
01:14:32,248 --> 01:14:36,082
...but I really and honestly feel
that we're pandering.

1218
01:14:38,454 --> 01:14:42,185
Which means trying to make others like you,
which I think is a really nice thing.

1219
01:14:42,358 --> 01:14:45,054
I do a lot of it.
"Just going out pandering, be back soon."

1220
01:14:45,227 --> 01:14:49,630
The song is about the struggle, you know,
to show your true feelings.

1221
01:14:49,798 --> 01:14:52,733
And your very confident sexual display...

1222
01:14:52,902 --> 01:14:56,895
...is, you know, a total contradiction
of the fear and insecurity.

1223
01:14:57,072 --> 01:15:00,235
No, I don't think so.
And my fans really love it when I dance.

1224
01:15:00,409 --> 01:15:02,707
- You're a wonderful dancer.
- That's a fair point.

1225
01:15:02,878 --> 01:15:06,245
- My last CD only went to number two.
- But in this case, if you trust us...

1226
01:15:06,415 --> 01:15:10,044
And Shakira is breathing down my neck.
So I wanna dance.

1227
01:15:12,087 --> 01:15:14,351
You shall dance.

1228
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:19,290
But thank you for your honesty, Sophie.
Cherish your passion.

1229
01:15:19,461 --> 01:15:23,329
- Well, thank you.
- Cora, Timberlake's here. Wants to say hi.

1230
01:15:23,599 --> 01:15:25,396
Nice to see you, C. Talk to you later.

1231
01:15:25,568 --> 01:15:27,832
And I'm looking forward
to the new last verse.

1232
01:15:28,003 --> 01:15:29,197
- Cora, wait.
- It's over.

1233
01:15:29,371 --> 01:15:31,965
It was a very nice try,
but you have hit the karmic wall.

1234
01:15:32,141 --> 01:15:36,202
With no help from you.
You just stood there. Talk about pandering.

1235
01:15:36,378 --> 01:15:39,040
I did not pander. I just told her
what she wanted to hear.

1236
01:15:39,215 --> 01:15:41,615
- I'm gonna go tell her the truth.
- You just did.

1237
01:15:41,784 --> 01:15:44,378
Are you gonna use flash cards this time?
You're stubborn.

1238
01:15:44,553 --> 01:15:47,522
And you're not stubborn enough
to stand up for what's good.

1239
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:50,921
I mean, I just don't wanna see you
do what you did on your solo album.

1240
01:15:51,093 --> 01:15:52,424
Yes, yes, yes.

1241
01:15:53,896 --> 01:15:56,364
I bought it. The last copy.

1242
01:15:57,266 --> 01:15:59,860
All right, well, I insist
on paying you back immediately.

1243
01:16:00,035 --> 01:16:01,468
9.99, right? Do you have a penny?

1244
01:16:01,637 --> 01:16:04,299
You were trying so hard to get a hit
that it wasn't you.

1245
01:16:04,473 --> 01:16:06,566
The songs were soulless.

1246
01:16:06,742 --> 01:16:09,370
I agree. But ours has soul, so...

1247
01:16:09,545 --> 01:16:12,878
But not if we ruin it. And you know that.
Why are you so scared to care?

1248
01:16:13,048 --> 01:16:15,141
Because it won't matter.

1249
01:16:15,317 --> 01:16:19,219
Because behind
all her Buddhism-in-a-thong philosophy...

1250
01:16:19,388 --> 01:16:22,653
...what she cares about
is seats filled and units sold.

1251
01:16:22,825 --> 01:16:24,486
Nothing's gonna make her your pal...

1252
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:26,958
...any more than years with Colin
made him mine.

1253
01:16:27,129 --> 01:16:29,563
Because in the end, it's all just business.

1254
01:16:29,732 --> 01:16:31,632
- What is?
- All of it. Everything.

1255
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,768
That's why they call it
the music business.

1256
01:16:33,936 --> 01:16:36,700
It's a good thing.
I wish everything in life was that clear.

1257
01:16:36,872 --> 01:16:39,340
I want something from you,
you want something from me.

1258
01:16:39,508 --> 01:16:41,032
No false promises or expectations.

1259
01:16:44,647 --> 01:16:46,114
Well.

1260
01:16:46,282 --> 01:16:48,512
Congratulations on your feel-good song.

1261
01:16:51,353 --> 01:16:52,877
Can I get you a drink?

1262
01:17:20,382 --> 01:17:23,351
There's plenty of time.
We have the night, part of the morning...

1263
01:17:23,519 --> 01:17:25,419
...teeniest little bit of the afternoon.

1264
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:57,441
I can't read it.
What does that...? What does that say?

1265
01:17:58,187 --> 01:18:00,087
"Sorry, I can't do this."

1266
01:18:05,194 --> 01:18:09,130
<i>Sorry, I can't do this</i>

1267
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:14,102
Not sure about the scansion.
What...? What, are you leaving?

1268
01:18:14,269 --> 01:18:18,467
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Maybe I'll think of something later.

1269
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,302
There is no later.
She needs the song tomorrow.

1270
01:18:21,477 --> 01:18:24,412
If we don't give it to her,
she's gonna go to someone else.

1271
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:25,945
I will have lost the job.

1272
01:18:26,115 --> 01:18:28,242
I'm sorry.

1273
01:18:29,051 --> 01:18:31,781
- Okay, look.
- No, I want to help. I do.

1274
01:18:31,954 --> 01:18:34,252
I wanna help you finish, but I can't.

1275
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:38,723
I can't write when I feel like this.
I'm not inspired.

1276
01:18:38,894 --> 01:18:43,263
I don't care. I don't care if you're inspired.
Inspiration's for amateurs.

1277
01:18:43,432 --> 01:18:46,924
I just want four lines. Please.
I just want four lines.

1278
01:18:47,102 --> 01:18:49,969
- I can't.
- Oh, but you can and you won't.

1279
01:18:50,139 --> 01:18:53,506
- Are you saying I wanted this to happen?
- I'm saying that's what you do.

1280
01:18:53,675 --> 01:18:56,007
You push and push
and move the furniture around...

1281
01:18:56,178 --> 01:18:57,873
...and talk all the time...

1282
01:18:58,046 --> 01:19:00,480
...and screw everything up
just like he said.

1283
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:03,611
Who's he? What are you talking about?
What are you saying?

1284
01:19:03,786 --> 01:19:06,550
I read the book because I wanted
to come to you and say:

1285
01:19:06,722 --> 01:19:10,453
"You're not at all like Sally Michaels."
But actually, he's got you spot on.

1286
01:19:10,626 --> 01:19:14,187
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying Sloan Cates was right.

1287
01:19:15,264 --> 01:19:19,257
Oh, my God. Please take that back.

1288
01:19:19,435 --> 01:19:22,893
The poor, innocent, helpless
"'I can't write,' she says to herself" girl...

1289
01:19:23,071 --> 01:19:25,096
...has co-authored
three-quarters of a hit...

1290
01:19:25,274 --> 01:19:28,402
...and is holding it ransom
because she can't get what she wants.

1291
01:19:28,577 --> 01:19:32,035
You think life is this fairy tale.

1292
01:19:32,214 --> 01:19:35,843
When it turns out that everything
doesn't end happily, you can't deal with it.

1293
01:19:57,105 --> 01:20:02,407
<i>Mama says I can't, Daddy says I can</i>
<i>Nut now my body just wants to slam</i>

1294
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:05,203
<i>Slam</i>

1295
01:20:06,181 --> 01:20:09,548
- C, Alex Fletcher is here.
- Hey, Alex.

1296
01:20:10,018 --> 01:20:13,249
C, could l...? Could I have a quick word?
Thanks a lot.

1297
01:20:13,622 --> 01:20:16,022
- Derek, how are you? Good to see you.
- Alex Fletcher.

1298
01:20:19,061 --> 01:20:21,154
Yo, so how's my girl Sophie, man?

1299
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:23,958
Yeah, no, she's keeping it pretty real.

1300
01:20:24,132 --> 01:20:25,827
Yeah, what a girl.

1301
01:20:26,001 --> 01:20:30,062
C, hi. Listen, it's about
the new last verse.

1302
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:33,299
It's not completely formed
in the classical sense yet.

1303
01:20:33,475 --> 01:20:36,933
It's more a kind of string of words
that you can connect in almost any way.

1304
01:20:37,112 --> 01:20:39,376
- I think it's quite innovative.
- I got the lyrics.

1305
01:20:39,548 --> 01:20:43,279
Sophie faxed them over this morning.
They are so beautiful.

1306
01:20:43,452 --> 01:20:45,716
It's what I always wanted to say
to my boyfriend.

1307
01:20:45,888 --> 01:20:48,721
It's the perfect end to the song.

1308
01:20:49,091 --> 01:20:53,721
<i>There are moments</i>
<i>When I don't know if it's real</i>

1309
01:20:53,896 --> 01:20:58,731
<i>Or if anybody feels the way I feel</i>

1310
01:20:58,901 --> 01:21:01,961
<i>I need inspiration</i>

1311
01:21:02,738 --> 01:21:08,472
<i>Not just another negotiation</i>

1312
01:21:10,112 --> 01:21:15,448
<i>All I wanna do</i>
<i>Is find a way back into...</i>

1313
01:21:16,618 --> 01:21:19,178
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Sorry, sorry.

1314
01:21:19,354 --> 01:21:22,448
I just... I just completely,
I don't know, spaced out.

1315
01:21:22,624 --> 01:21:25,354
That's okay. Let's take it from the top
with the new intro.

1316
01:21:25,527 --> 01:21:27,324
Yep. Great.

1317
01:21:29,231 --> 01:21:33,327
<i>Yeah, Cora Corman and Alex Fletcher</i>

1318
01:21:33,502 --> 01:21:35,493
<i>Way back into love</i>

1319
01:21:41,143 --> 01:21:42,132
Hi.

1320
01:21:42,778 --> 01:21:44,336
Hello.

1321
01:21:45,047 --> 01:21:48,949
I bought these for your children because
one should never show up empty-handed.

1322
01:21:49,518 --> 01:21:53,887
They're aliens.
Clearly, I have no children. Here.

1323
01:21:54,056 --> 01:21:56,854
- Here, let me get that for you.
- Thank you.

1324
01:21:59,995 --> 01:22:03,487
I am gonna go to the office.

1325
01:22:04,099 --> 01:22:06,863
- I am too. Have fun with those.
- Bye.

1326
01:22:13,175 --> 01:22:15,439
Put them there, thanks.

1327
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:19,208
You coming to the concert tomorrow?

1328
01:22:19,648 --> 01:22:21,707
Can't disappoint Lucy.

1329
01:22:21,883 --> 01:22:24,078
Yes, yes, very important.

1330
01:22:24,987 --> 01:22:29,651
Chris is bringing his daughter as well,
so should be fun.

1331
01:22:29,992 --> 01:22:32,927
I just wanted to say
I thought your last verse was fantastic.

1332
01:22:33,362 --> 01:22:34,351
Thank you, Alex.

1333
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:37,662
And I'm very sorry about what I said.

1334
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:41,462
Well, you know, life isn't a fairy tale
and I have to grow up...

1335
01:22:41,637 --> 01:22:43,502
...and I'm gonna do that in Florida.

1336
01:22:44,172 --> 01:22:46,140
Well, that's just ridiculous.

1337
01:22:46,308 --> 01:22:49,573
No one grows up in Florida.
Unless they're an orange.

1338
01:22:49,745 --> 01:22:52,543
Well, I'm managing
the new Weight-Not branch in Boca Raton.

1339
01:22:52,714 --> 01:22:55,376
You should be writing,
not fighting cellulite.

1340
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:58,110
Well, I can do both.
We need a new marketing campaign.

1341
01:22:58,286 --> 01:23:00,049
Swimsuit season is coming up.

1342
01:23:01,623 --> 01:23:03,215
Thing is...

1343
01:23:04,626 --> 01:23:06,719
...I can't...

1344
01:23:10,298 --> 01:23:12,596
...compose without you.

1345
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:15,635
Thanks, but I don't think
it's a good idea.

1346
01:23:20,509 --> 01:23:22,374
All right. You're obviously very busy.

1347
01:23:27,816 --> 01:23:29,408
Good luck.

1348
01:23:30,252 --> 01:23:31,549
You too.

1349
01:25:18,827 --> 01:25:20,488
Cora!

1350
01:25:24,966 --> 01:25:27,696
- Gracie, aren't you excited?
- Let's go.

1351
01:25:29,404 --> 01:25:33,397
You know what? You guys, just go.
I think I'm gonna skip it.

1352
01:25:33,575 --> 01:25:36,043
- No, come on. You can't skip it.
- You know what, kids?

1353
01:25:36,211 --> 01:25:38,679
I'm gonna talk to your aunt, okay?
Gary, take them in.

1354
01:25:38,847 --> 01:25:40,872
- Should I meet you...?
- Do it. How hard is it?

1355
01:25:41,049 --> 01:25:42,539
- Go, walk, sit.
- Find your seats.

1356
01:25:42,717 --> 01:25:45,652
Honey, I need a second. Thank you.
Love you. You're a good man.

1357
01:25:45,821 --> 01:25:47,015
Now, listen to me.

1358
01:25:47,189 --> 01:25:51,751
Those kids have told all of their friends
that their aunt wrote Cora's new hit song.

1359
01:25:51,927 --> 01:25:54,521
And they wanna share this with you.
You gotta go in.

1360
01:25:54,696 --> 01:25:57,631
Yeah. No, I know. I know. I just...

1361
01:25:57,799 --> 01:26:01,530
I don't know how I'm gonna go in there
and look at him.

1362
01:26:02,737 --> 01:26:05,934
I know. It's just one night, though,
and I really think you need this.

1363
01:26:06,107 --> 01:26:10,635
And then he'll go his way
and you'll go yours. Okay?

1364
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:17,480
Do you have her autograph?

1365
01:26:17,652 --> 01:26:18,914
- Isn't this exciting?
- Yeah.

1366
01:26:19,521 --> 01:26:20,545
This is so cool.

1367
01:26:21,356 --> 01:26:24,223
- Yeah, weirdo. This is so cool.
- It's great.

1368
01:26:24,392 --> 01:26:26,724
We're in the Cora fan club.
Can we? Please, Mom?

1369
01:26:26,895 --> 01:26:29,591
- Okay.
- Cora!

1370
01:26:51,453 --> 01:26:53,387
Cora!

1371
01:26:53,555 --> 01:26:54,783
Cora!

1372
01:27:05,333 --> 01:27:06,994
Cora!

1373
01:27:31,593 --> 01:27:34,824
- Look, there she is!
- Is that Cora?

1374
01:27:51,346 --> 01:27:52,745
<i>I'm starting to believe, boy</i>

1375
01:27:53,915 --> 01:27:55,348
<i>That this was meant to be, boy</i>

1376
01:27:55,517 --> 01:27:58,179
<i>'Cause I believe in karma</i>

1377
01:27:58,353 --> 01:28:00,821
<i>Noy, do you believe in karma?</i>

1378
01:28:03,692 --> 01:28:07,651
<i>Each time you put your lips to mine</i>
<i>It's like a taste of Nuddha's delight</i>

1379
01:28:07,829 --> 01:28:13,563
- Hey, Gary.
- Come on. I'm just watching.

1380
01:28:14,703 --> 01:28:17,695
<i>Tell me all your fantasies tonight</i>

1381
01:28:17,872 --> 01:28:19,464
<i>And I will make them happen 'cause</i>

1382
01:28:19,641 --> 01:28:24,169
<i>I'm not satisfied if I don't get</i>

1383
01:28:24,346 --> 01:28:26,712
<i>My Nuddha's delight</i>

1384
01:28:27,449 --> 01:28:30,179
<i>Om shanti, shanti</i>

1385
01:28:32,287 --> 01:28:37,782
<i>This Tuesday on The CW,</i>
<i>it's</i> Battle of the '80s Has-Beens...

1386
01:28:37,959 --> 01:28:41,190
<i>... featuring Tiffany battling</i>
<i>reigning champion Debbie Gibson...</i>

1387
01:28:41,363 --> 01:28:44,025
<i>... followed by a bout</i>
<i>between Adam Ant and Nilly Idol.</i>

1388
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,766
<i>Tuesday night on The CW.</i>

1389
01:28:49,170 --> 01:28:51,502
Five minutes, Mr. Fletcher.

1390
01:28:54,142 --> 01:28:58,738
<i>Entering Nootytown</i>
<i>So shake my booty now</i>

1391

<i>'Cause your booty</i>
<i>Is the way into his heart</i>

1392
01:29:18,833 --> 01:29:20,994
New York, I love you!

1393
01:29:23,238 --> 01:29:24,500
Shanti, shanti.

1394
01:29:24,672 --> 01:29:25,866
What's that mean?

1395
01:29:26,041 --> 01:29:28,976
And now I'd like you to hear
something very special.

1396
01:29:29,144 --> 01:29:32,170
- Oh, Soph.
- Something very different.

1397
01:29:32,347 --> 01:29:33,814
It's a new song.

1398
01:29:33,982 --> 01:29:35,973
This is it, weirdo, your song.

1399
01:29:37,218 --> 01:29:40,619
- I don't think I can listen to this.
- A song no one has heard before...

1400
01:29:40,789 --> 01:29:44,418
...written by Mr. Alex Fletcher.

1401
01:29:44,592 --> 01:29:45,581
Wait.

1402
01:29:51,599 --> 01:29:54,727
What? Alex Fletcher and my sister.

1403
01:29:54,903 --> 01:29:56,302
How quickly they forget.

1404
01:29:57,505 --> 01:30:00,338
Let's just go and come back
when the song's over. You and me.

1405
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:04,441
- Actually, I'm gonna go.
- No. What?

1406
01:30:04,612 --> 01:30:06,637
- Yeah, no. I'm fine. Just...
- Are you sure?

1407
01:30:06,815 --> 01:30:10,046
Yeah, I'm fine. I just wanna be alone.
Just take care of the kids.

1408

<i>It's never been easy for me</i>

1409

1410
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:46,919

<i>Something on my mind</i>

1411
01:30:48,957 --> 01:30:53,553

<i>These few brief awkward lines</i>

1412
01:30:55,730 --> 01:30:59,723
<i>Since I met you</i>
<i>My whole life has changed</i>

1413
01:31:02,137 --> 01:31:06,665
<i>It's not just my furniture</i>
<i>You've rearranged</i>

1414
01:31:08,843 --> 01:31:14,543
<i>I was living in the past</i>
<i>Nut somehow you've brought me back</i>

1415
01:31:15,049 --> 01:31:20,544
<i>And I haven't felt like this</i>
<i>Since before Frankie said, "Relax"</i>

1416
01:31:20,722 --> 01:31:23,213
<i>And though I know</i>

1417
01:31:23,391 --> 01:31:26,360
<i>Nased on my track record</i>

1418

<i>I might not seem like the safest bet</i>

1419

<i>All I'm asking you</i>

1420
01:31:35,803 --> 01:31:39,705
<i>Is don't write me off just yet</i>

1421
01:31:51,219 --> 01:31:55,212
<i>For years I've been telling myself</i>
<i>The same old story</i>

1422
01:31:57,425 --> 01:32:01,987
<i>That I'm happy to live off</i>
<i>My so-called former glories</i>

1423
01:32:03,865 --> 01:32:09,804
<i>Nut you've given me a reason</i>
<i>To take another chance</i>

1424
01:32:10,305 --> 01:32:15,766
<i>Now I need you despite the fact</i>
<i>That you've killed all my plants</i>

1425
01:32:16,110 --> 01:32:18,169
<i>And though I know</i>

1426
01:32:18,346 --> 01:32:21,372
<i>I've already blown more chances</i>

1427
01:32:21,549 --> 01:32:24,575
<i>Than anyone should ever get</i>

1428
01:32:28,489 --> 01:32:30,980
<i>All I'm asking you</i>

1429
01:32:31,159 --> 01:32:34,925

1430
01:32:38,199 --> 01:32:42,761
<i>Don't write me off just yet</i>

1431
01:33:00,355 --> 01:33:01,982
Alex!

1432
01:33:24,012 --> 01:33:26,572
- Nobody backstage.
- I have to get up there. I know Cora.

1433
01:33:26,748 --> 01:33:29,546
- I don't care what you want.
- I know Cora. I wrote this song.

1434
01:33:29,717 --> 01:33:30,706
She's okay.

1435
01:33:30,885 --> 01:33:33,319
- There's nobody backstage.
- I said she's okay, right?

1436
01:33:33,488 --> 01:33:35,479
- Well, you vouch for her, then.
- Thank you.

1437
01:33:35,657 --> 01:33:36,749
What's wrong with you?

1438
01:33:36,924 --> 01:33:39,449
As soon as Cora's done "Slam,"
we'll need you on-stage.

1439
01:33:39,627 --> 01:33:42,061
Okay, got it. Got it.
Thanks very much. Cheers.

1440
01:33:43,698 --> 01:33:45,723
<i>Slam</i>

1441
01:33:46,334 --> 01:33:51,738
<i>Mama says I can't, Daddy says I can</i>
<i>Nut now my body just wants to slam</i>

1442
01:33:53,041 --> 01:33:54,201
<i>Slam</i>

1443
01:33:56,144 --> 01:33:58,009
Come to a concert, don't bring anything?

1444
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:01,674
Alex, that song.

1445
01:34:01,849 --> 01:34:05,114
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
It's the best I could do. You could fix it.

1446
01:34:05,286 --> 01:34:08,380
No. That song was dinner.

1447
01:34:11,859 --> 01:34:14,123
<i>Mama says I can't, Daddy says I can</i>

1448
01:34:17,632 --> 01:34:18,758
Thank you!

1449
01:34:22,303 --> 01:34:25,363
I want you to hear my new single.

1450
01:34:26,207 --> 01:34:27,936
Thank you!

"Way Back Into Love," music and lyrics
by Sophie Fisher and Alex Fletcher.

1452
01:34:33,047 --> 01:34:35,515
What happened to steamy and sticky?

1453
01:34:35,683 --> 01:34:38,709
I explained to Cora that it violated
the very core of the lyric...

1454
01:34:38,886 --> 01:34:40,751
...and corrupted the purity of the song.

1455
01:34:40,922 --> 01:34:43,857
When that didn't work, I told her
it would help me win you back.

1456
01:34:44,025 --> 01:34:45,287
And that did it.

1457
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:49,794
Turns out that although she thought
the Dalai Lama was, incredibly, a llama...

1458
01:34:49,964 --> 01:34:52,159
...she is, in fact, quite the romantic.

1459
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:54,800
- Go. Go. Go.
- Okay, Mr. Fletcher.

1460
01:34:54,969 --> 01:34:56,436
Thank you.

<i>And dreams away</i>

<i>Just in case I ever need 'em</i>
<i>Again someday</i>

1464
01:35:11,652 --> 01:35:14,644
<i>I've been setting aside time</i>

<i>To clear a little space</i>

<i>Without a way back into love</i>

<i>I've been watching</i>
<i>Nut the stars refuse to shine</i>

1469
01:35:49,791 --> 01:35:54,626
<i>I've been searching</i>
<i>Nut I just don't see the signs</i>

1470
01:35:54,796 --> 01:35:58,527

<i>I've been looking for someone</i>
<i>To shed some light</i>

1473
01:36:08,509 --> 01:36:12,809
<i>Not somebody just to get me</i>
<i>Through the night</i>

1474
01:36:13,181 --> 01:36:16,207
<i>I could use some direction</i>

1475
01:36:18,019 --> 01:36:22,115
<i>And I'm open to your suggestions</i>

1476

<i>And if I open my heart to you</i>

1479
01:36:44,545 --> 01:36:48,948
<i>I'm hoping you'll show me what to do</i>

1480
01:36:49,116 --> 01:36:53,280
<i>And if you help me to start again</i>

1481
01:36:54,388 --> 01:37:01,294
<i>You know that I'll be there</i>
<i>For you in the end</i>
