00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,820
COLIN: That's not my fault. (CHUCKLES)

478
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,795
I told you not to put it there.

479
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,500
Under the bed.

480
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,494
Hi.

481
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,436
Morning, 6-C.

482
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,770
Hey, I see that you have company,

483
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,709
but I just want to ask you
a really quick question.

484
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,871
Remember how you said
you were good at digging up dirt?

485
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:06,417
Do you think that maybe I could pay you
to find some people for me?

486
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:10,116
Sweetheart, if I'm gonna help you,
you got to give me more info than that.

487
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:12,155
Just some guys that I've dated.

488
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,886
Oh, you have herpes.
That's not a fun call to make.

489
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,659
No, I...

490
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:17,785
I don't know. I just...

491
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:21,627
I think that one of these guys
might be worth a second look.

492
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:33,574
No. I refuse to be
a part of this type of crazy.

493
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:36,408
I don't know why these guys broke up
with you, and I need to protect them.

494
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,307
Wait. Why do you assume
they all broke up with me?

495
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,849
Because you seem like the type of girl
who tries to make a bad thing work.

496
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:44,844
Some people call that optimism.

497
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,014
I call it crazy.

498
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,355
I'm sorry I asked. I knew you'd be a jerk.

499
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,157
Don't be mad.
It doesn't mean I won't sleep with you.

500
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,797
Ugh! Gross.

501
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:12,912
Colin! Colin, open up! Colin!

502
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,618
Colin, we got to go!
Mom fell in the shower.

503
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,085
- What?
- Yeah, she fell in the shower!

504
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,282
Hi.

505
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:24,327
She's at the hospital. She's all wet.

506
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,892
We got to get out of here!

507
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,592
They're drying her off right now,
as we speak.

508
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,568
I'm so sorry.
You seem like a really awesome person.

509
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,470
I'm sure he's gonna call you,
but we got to go!

510
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,666
Come on! She's hurt!

511
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,144
(CHUCKLES) Very impressive.

512
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,476
Hmm.

513
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,877
You help me track down my exes,
I'll help you escape yours.

514
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,278
What happened to protecting your sisters?

515
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:54,186
If those girls can't see you coming,
they deserve what they get.

516
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,782
Wow. Jesus.

517
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,128
This place really goes
on and on, doesn't it?

518
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,023
And you can use my apartment to hide in.

519
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,697
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

520
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,171
Thanks, Diana. Okay.

521
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,333
So, here's all the info I have on the guys.

522
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,239
Names, most recent phone numbers...

523
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,676
Hey! Addresses.

524
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,682
Find out who's alive, single,
and still on the East Coast, okay?

525
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:21,979
I'll take a car or a
train, but not a plane.

526
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,546
I prioritized the list,
so start at the top.

527
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,182
Jake Adams. Is that the one that got away?

528
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,261
Well, something like that.

529
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:33,455
His dad's name is also Jake Adams
and he owns, like, half of Boston.

530
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,261
- So, he should be pretty easy to find.
- The Jake Adams?

531
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:37,993
Well, he may not be hard to find,

532
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,433
but I guarantee
he's gonna be hard to get to.

533
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,838
You don't have a phone number or address
or anything like that?

534
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,066
If I had that, I wouldn't need you.

535
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,372
I do know that Tom Piper
is on the fast track to becoming a senator.

536
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,810
Oh, and move John Kimble
up to number three.

537
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:53,042
He probably still works at Starbucks,
but he's the best sex I've ever had.

538
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,448
You haven't had sex with me.

539
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,783
No, but I have had sex with other
overly confident struggling musicians.

540
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,254
So, I'm good.

541
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,984
What makes you think I'm a musician?

542
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,118
Guitar in your apartment,
you dress like a horny teenager,

543
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,163
I paid for that sandwich.
Struggling musician.

544
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,121
So, I don't get it.
Why go through all this trouble?

545
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,359
Why not just find a new guy?

546
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,697
No. No new guys.

547
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,498
New is always better than old.

548
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:14,867
Of course you'd say that.

549
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,942
I bet the longest relationship
you've ever had is with that sandwich.

She's not gonna 69.

No, because he's still a bartender.

No, there's a lot of reasons
why I won't sleep with you.

No, there's not.

about their number anyway.

You guys all have this ideal girl
in your minds

we can't be that girl.

You know,
you can take her home to the family,

00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:48,551
she's smart, but not smarter than you,
and she bakes apple pies with your mom

and plays catch
with your handicapped sister,

she's takes off her glasses

and puts on a vinyl cat suit
and fucks you sideways!

That girl doesn't exist.
If she did, I'd be sleeping with her.

many people you've slept with anyway?

00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,334
You hooked up with someone last night
after I left you?

631
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,370
Hooking up sounds so crass.

632
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,769
We shared a romantic experience.

633
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,571
And then I told her
I had an early dentist appointment,

634
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:48,440
and I'm hiding on your
couch till she leaves.

635
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:52,983
Well, maybe you could use this downtime
to do some actual work.

636
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:56,212
I am working.
I set up a Facebook account for you.

637
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,812
(SIGHS) I don't want to be on Facebook.
What picture did you use?

638
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,391
The one I just took of you sleeping.

639
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,087
I think this is gonna be better.

640
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,923
While you're looking for them,
they can be looking for you.

641
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,462
Fine, but I refuse to tweet.

642
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:07,588
Ooh!

643
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:10,997
Number 14, Evan Slater,
has friend-requested you.

644
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,831
He's tagged you in a photo

645
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:16,202
and he's suggested
you become a fan of Tito's Tacos.

646
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,274
Ooh. I liked Evan.

647
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,310
Yeah, and who doesn't like tacos?

648
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,913
(GASPS) He's adorable.

649
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,608
And so are his wife and kids.

650
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,415
Well, he clearly doesn't understand
what Facebook is for.

651
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,547
You know, if you don't start
taking this job more seriously,

652
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:36,183
you're fired from using my apartment.

653
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,188
Where's my coffee pot?

654
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,661
I broke it.

655
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,056
If you were on Twitter,
you'd know that already.

656
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,864
You owe me $19.95.

657
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,907
How about I pay you back in Chinese food?

658
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,498
I ordered Charlie Chiang.

659
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,407
Did you get the itty-bitty spare ribs?

660
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,011
Okay, I'll be there in five minutes.

661
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,508
Hey.

662
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,375
Hey, come on in.

663
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,452
(EXHALES IN AWE)

664
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,656
- Wow.
- Yeah.

665
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,791
Dad didn't take me to too many ball games,

666
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,388
but we did go on a lot of stakeouts.

667
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:16,932
It's impressive.

668
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,798
COLIN: Okay, so Mike Miller
and Eric Hamilton are married.

669
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,270
So is Valerio, the guy from Italy.

670
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:26,806
- Ew.
- Plum sauce?

671
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,401
Yes, please, but no mustard.

672
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,742
No mustard? Mustard's the best part.

673
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,110
Not if you hate mustard.

674
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,746
Anything on Jake Adams yet?

675
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,410
No. I'm sorry.

676
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,852
I told you, rich people are very good
at protecting their privacy,

677
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,150
but just be patient, we'll find him.

678
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,722
What about Simon Forester?

679
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,795
He's separated
and his house just went on the market,

680
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,523
so I'm guessing a divorce
is right around the corner.

681
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:50,496
Huh. Okay. Let's try Simon.

682
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,932
Simon.

683
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:55,800
Okay, so what's my plan?
Guy getting a divorce.

684
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,531
Divorce...

685
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,769
I could find out who his lawyer is
and get a job there as his assistant.

686
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:07,580
Or we keep it simple
and you just go look at his open house.

687
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,354
Huh.

688
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,582
The challenge with a newly divorced guy
is that he's just looking to have fun.

689
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,556
What you got to do
is give him the best sex of his life.

690
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,629
He can't realize that he's falling
in love with you until it's too late.

691
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:22,324
So, I'm covering up the fact that
I'm marriage material with amazing sex?

692
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:26,030
- Yeah. How's your blowjob?
- What?

693
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,537
Relax. This is business.
I'm trying to help you.

694
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,664
Well, if you must know, it's pretty good.

695
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,936
It's the hand job
I haven't quite figured out yet.

696
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,808
Well, I guarantee you he has, so skip it.

697
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:38,606
All right, I guess this is it.

698
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,047
- Ready?
- Yeah.

699
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:45,045
This is nice. Simon's doing well.

700
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:48,016
I wonder where the realtor is.

701
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,456
Hello?

702
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,821
Is that...

703
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,225
(EX CLAIMS)

704
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,700
What the...

705
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,268
- Donald!
- Ally!

706
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,168
What the fuck are you doing in my home?

707
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:03,931
Uh...

708
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:08,546
The door was open, so I just assumed
this was the open house.

709
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,775
No. No. This is my house.
You're in my home.

710
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:14,314
Oh, well...

711
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,621
My fiancé, Pierre,
and I are looking to buy a place

712
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,487
when he gets back from the North Pole.

713
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:27,030
Hey, Ally, can I go ahead
and get that picture back from you?

714
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:31,194
(LAUGHS) Oh, I'm sorry. Oops.

715
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,609
(TOILET FLUSHING)

716
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,618
That was Disgusting Donald.

717
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,811
He didn't look disgusting.

718
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,684
He was disgusting when I dated him, okay?

719
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,488
Oh, my God, there's Simon.

720
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:01,656
He looks good for a guy
going through a divorce.

721
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:10,901
(WITH ENGLISH ACCENT)
Before you take my order,

722
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:15,377
I do feel compelled to explain
why a single, straight man

723
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,811
is having high tea by himself
on Beacon Hill.

724
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,678
Well,

725
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:23,618
I'm just so homesick
that I'd kill for anything English.

726
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:33,058
Okay, so go. I can take it from here.

727
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,563
- Don't shove me.
- Get out of here.

728
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,030
Don't shove me.

729
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,500
- Get out of here!
- Hey! I said don't shove me!

730
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,436

731
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:42,937
Is that you?

732
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,436
(WITH ENGLISH ACCENT)
Simon, I can't believe it.

733
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,176
What are the chances?

734
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:53,414
It's brilliant to see you.

735
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,644
It is brilliant.

736
00:40:55,753 --> 00:41:00,588
Simon, this is my neighbor, Colin.
But he has to go now.

737
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,158
No, I don't.

- No, no, the pleasure's all mine.

Wow.

Wow. It's great to see...

Did you look this good
when we were dating?

742
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,204
Oh, well, I had a fringe back then.

That's bangs. "Fringe" is "bangs."

so I've got to disappear for an hour or so,

(SIGHS) My British accent was a little
rusty, and halfway through darts

753
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,330
I started sounding like Eliza Doolittle.

754

Don't take your eye off the board.

755

You were saying you got sacked.

758
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,955
Yep. Losing me job
wasn't the end of the world.

759

Still got me mates and a roof over me 'ead.

760
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,954
I don't need much, just a room somewhere,

far away from the cold night air.

762
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,230
And then when I tried to pull out of it,

763
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:27,469
for some reason I panicked
and went full Borat.

(SIGHS) Okay. Who else we got?

I wrote that memo.

and my band and I practice up here.

00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:46,086
I know it's not geographically desirable,
but he is a doctor now.

788
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,021
Don't care. I hate Miami.

789
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,490
I think too much sun makes people stupid.

790
00:43:50,986 --> 00:43:52,783
Okay. How do you feel about Denver?

791
00:43:52,888 --> 00:43:56,449
I found the mountain man, and that guy
has got a caboose worth relocating for.

792
00:43:56,558 --> 00:43:59,254
Pass! He always wanted
to breathe fresh air.

793
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:01,659
Do you know how exhausting it was
to pretend to enjoy the outdoors

794
00:44:01,763 --> 00:44:02,957
with that kind of enthusiasm?

795
00:44:03,064 --> 00:44:04,998
More exhausting
than pretending to be British?

796
00:44:05,133 --> 00:44:07,795
I never had to wipe myself with a leaf
when I was pretending to be British.

797
00:44:07,903 --> 00:44:11,839
Touché. What about Gerry Perry?
He's a puppeteer, so he's single.

Where's Jake Adams?

801
00:44:17,412 --> 00:44:20,074
- In Noyaradougou.
- What? Where the hell's that?

802

Africa.

803
00:44:21,883 --> 00:44:23,851
He runs
his family's philanthropic foundation

804
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:27,388
and he's overseeing the construction
of a school there.

805
00:44:30,492 --> 00:44:31,550
Is he ever coming back?

806
00:44:32,561 --> 00:44:35,587
Eventually. In the meantime,
I've got Gerry Perry.

All right, so the puppet show starts at
2:00, and I'll meet you at the park.

810
00:44:42,037 --> 00:44:43,629
(SIGHING) Okay.

811

- Hey, Colin.
- Yeah?

812
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:48,841
Thank you for all your hard work,
by the way.

813
00:44:48,944 --> 00:44:51,003
I really appreciate it.

You do?

815
00:44:52,347 --> 00:44:54,406
Because sometimes, it's hard to tell.

816
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:56,380
Really?

817
00:44:57,252 --> 00:44:58,310

You really can't hang out with a girl
without sleeping with her, can you?

823
00:45:16,738 --> 00:45:19,502
Well, I can, it's just not that much fun.

- Whose kid is this?
- He's my nephew.

If I'd shown up to the puppet show
without a child, it might be creepy.

Great. Huh.

00:51:49,247 --> 00:51:52,341
is more important
than helping me plan my wedding?

947
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,748
I know it sounds stupid to you,
but it is important.

948
00:51:54,852 --> 00:51:57,787
I feel like everyone else
is moving on with their lives but me.

949
00:51:57,922 --> 00:52:00,982
Ally, I'm all for moving on, I really am,

950
00:52:01,092 --> 00:52:04,926
but it just feels like
this quest you're on is a little nuts.

951
00:52:05,029 --> 00:52:07,862
(SIGHS) You know what? If you hadn't given
your ex-boyfriend a second chance,

952
00:52:07,966 --> 00:52:09,593
you wouldn't even be having a wedding.

953
00:52:09,701 --> 00:52:13,364
Besides, I need a Pap smear
and he takes my insurance.

954
00:52:13,471 --> 00:52:14,961
I'm late for my spray tan.

955
00:52:33,591 --> 00:52:35,081
Hello, Allison.

956
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:39,223
Barrett?

957
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:42,356
Oh, my God, is that you?

958
00:52:43,935 --> 00:52:45,266
Hi.

959
00:52:46,237 --> 00:52:49,229
It's Ally. Ally Darling.

960
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,740
Oh. Yeah, from spinning.

961
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:53,536
No.

962
00:52:53,644 --> 00:52:55,168
From... Oh, Greg's birthday party.

963
00:52:55,913 --> 00:52:58,040
We went to college together.

964
00:53:00,018 --> 00:53:01,383
- We dated.
- Oh.

965
00:53:03,154 --> 00:53:04,314
How about that?

966
00:53:04,422 --> 00:53:06,720
Well, that was a long time ago.

967
00:53:06,824 --> 00:53:10,260
So, let's see how things are going now.
Can you scooch?

968
00:53:11,195 --> 00:53:12,355
Very good.

969
00:53:12,463 --> 00:53:13,589
(HUMMING)

970
00:53:21,572 --> 00:53:24,268
Ally! Of course.

971
00:53:27,712 --> 00:53:30,476
He recognized my vagina!

972
00:53:30,615 --> 00:53:34,608
What's going on down there?
I got to say, I'm a little freaked out.

973
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:36,311
Well, I'd be happy to take a look for you.

974
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,787
(GROANS) I used all my miles for that!

975
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:40,983
Cross Barrett off the list!

976
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,117
You know what? Cross the list off the list!

977
00:53:43,227 --> 00:53:44,387
What am I doing?

978
00:53:44,495 --> 00:53:49,228
Unemployed, spending every last dime
trying to track down these assholes

979
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:51,801
who already broke up with me once.

980
00:53:51,903 --> 00:53:54,337
Maybe I should just quit.

981
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:57,465
Well, that's too bad,
'cause I found Tom Piper.

982
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,641
Keep talking.

983
00:53:59,744 --> 00:54:01,143
He's in D.C., like you said.

984
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,439
He's working as an aide
for Senator Mitchell.

985
00:54:07,652 --> 00:54:08,914
I don't have anything
a politician's wife would wear.

986
00:54:09,053 --> 00:54:10,111
Ooh!

987
00:54:10,221 --> 00:54:12,917
I do have a store credit
for Ann Taylor. Ha!

988

and I have to poo.</i>

Okay, let yourself in,
I'll be home in 10 minutes.

991
00:54:22,967 --> 00:54:24,400
Hi.

992
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:27,196
Hey.

993
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,567
Oh, Jesus.

994
00:54:28,673 --> 00:54:30,470
Tell me you're not naked on my couch
next to my sister.

995
00:54:31,776 --> 00:54:34,472
Thankfully, he doesn't like to play
without his underwear.

996
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:36,774
The guitar gets cold against his penis.

997
00:54:36,881 --> 00:54:39,543
So, you two have met.

998
00:54:39,951 --> 00:54:42,283
Hey, remember Tom Piper?

999
00:54:42,386 --> 00:54:45,378
Colin found him in D.C.,
so I'm going there tomorrow,

1000
00:54:46,457 --> 00:54:48,118
wearing this!

1001
00:54:48,226 --> 00:54:49,625
I'm so excited.

1002
00:54:49,727 --> 00:54:51,354
Then why would you wear a pantsuit?

1003
00:54:51,462 --> 00:54:53,692
Don't you have your interview
at Sheffield and Bloom tomorrow?

1004
00:54:53,798 --> 00:54:55,663
That's the beauty of a pantsuit, you know.

1005
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,961
It works for both a super-boring interview

1006
00:54:58,069 --> 00:55:01,835
and for an accidental, on-purpose
encounter with my future husband.

1007
00:55:01,939 --> 00:55:04,601
Hey, did you ever try and sell
those freaky little sculptures you make?

1008
00:55:04,709 --> 00:55:07,940
- No, she needs a real job.
- Oh, yeah, those are just a hobby.

1009
00:55:08,045 --> 00:55:09,137
COLIN: I think they're amazing.

1010
00:55:09,247 --> 00:55:11,181
You should try.
Not everyone can do that, you know.

1011
00:55:12,483 --> 00:55:13,950
Excuse me,
would you mind giving me and Ally

1012
00:55:14,051 --> 00:55:15,018
a little bit of privacy, please?

1013
00:55:16,669 --> 00:55:18,933
- She has to poo.
- Ally!

1014
00:55:20,005 --> 00:55:22,030
Hey, hasn't your lady friend left yet?

1015
00:55:22,174 --> 00:55:24,574
No, I guess this one's a late sleeper.

1016
00:55:24,677 --> 00:55:25,666
Wait. Are you...

1017
00:55:25,778 --> 00:55:29,270
Is he hiding out here
because there's a woman in his apartment?

1018
00:55:29,381 --> 00:55:30,848
He is.

1019
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:33,350
That's it. I'm going
to Anthony's Bakery. Excuse me.

1020
00:55:33,452 --> 00:55:36,717
Do you want to grab me a cannoli? No?

Okay. Keys.

- Who the hell are you?
- Andrea.

1024
00:55:58,878 --> 00:56:01,278
He didn't tell you he was engaged?

1025
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:04,213
No. I am so sorry.

1026
00:56:04,316 --> 00:56:07,513
When I told him I was engaged,
he didn't say anything.

(DOOR CLOSING)

Hey, wouldn't it be easier

1035
00:56:36,382 --> 00:56:38,543
if you just spent the night
at their apartments

1036
00:56:38,651 --> 00:56:41,017
and left in the morning, like a normal guy?

1037
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,849
No.

1038
00:56:42,955 --> 00:56:44,388
I once stayed in a relationship with a girl

1039
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:46,890
because of a picture she had
on her bedside table.

1040
00:56:46,992 --> 00:56:50,450
It was her dressed as Cinderella
on her fifth birthday.

1041
00:56:52,164 --> 00:56:53,222
Grab that.

1042
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:54,896
So?

1043
00:56:55,668 --> 00:56:59,832
So, every time I tried to split with her, I'd
picture that little girl in the blue dress.

1044
00:56:59,939 --> 00:57:03,602
Happy. Excited about Monty,
her new gerbil,

1045
00:57:03,709 --> 00:57:07,042
who she would later kill
by accidentally putting him in the dryer.

(SIGHS)

1047

Just couldn't break that
little girl's heart.

1048
00:57:19,525 --> 00:57:22,323
So you're saying it's easier to sleep
with girls and never call them again

1049
00:57:22,428 --> 00:57:25,022
if you don't know anything about them?

1050
00:57:26,932 --> 00:57:28,559
Kind of like a serial killer.

1051
00:57:30,836 --> 00:57:32,428
Yeah, I guess so.

1052
00:57:32,938 --> 00:57:34,030
