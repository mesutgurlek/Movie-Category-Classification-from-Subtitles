1
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:09,896
Pimmi, please bring the phone.

2
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:15,465
<i>Darling, you want something else?
Tea? Nimbu pani?</i>

3
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:17,874
No, no. That bloody bastard Dubey
hasn't come yet.

4
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:37,596
Alice?

5
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:44,568
Pimmi, I'm sorry to say,
but Lalit takes on too much tension.

6
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:46,299
It’s not good.

7
00:03:46,373 --> 00:03:49,467
<i>You see all these young men
getting heart attacks these days.</i>

8
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:54,442
<i>And Lalit is doing everything
single-handedly.</i>

9
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,414
Left, left, you idiot!
You want to spoil-

10
00:04:39,492 --> 00:04:41,187
Stop the car!

11
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:42,888
You'll spoil the decorations also.

12
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:45,557
Don't you even know how to drive?
I've only got one hand to drive with.

13
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:48,965
Who told you to break your hand
at this time, idiot? Where were you?

14
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:50,730
I went to the airport to get
your sister and her husband.

15
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:53,170
Where are they?
I didn't see them.

16
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:56,840
What do you mean, you didn't see them?

17
00:04:58,411 --> 00:05:01,471
Hold up a placard:
"Mr. and Mrs. Tej Puri from USA."

18
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:03,846
<i>They could have seen you.</i>

19
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:06,249
<i>Why are you yawning so much?
I've hardly slept.</i>

20
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,549
Not to mention I got back
from Australia just yesterday.

21
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:10,988
You young people!

22
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:13,651
What do you need
to sleep so much for?

23
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:15,888
What time is the flight coming?
About 9:00.

24
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:18,795
Make sure you're there on time.
And take this car, okay?

25
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:22,266
And only run the AC
when you've received them.

26
00:05:22,335 --> 00:05:24,963
And park this car somewhere else!
Chill.

27
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:27,097
<i>And take off that stupid topi.</i>

28
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:31,808
Where the hell
are those girls?

29
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:37,845
Oh, God, Varun,
what are you doing with that?

30
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:40,215
Why haven't you got ready?
Didn't you hear Papa?

31
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:45,417
<i>- He's getting so angry.
- It’s the last step. Coconut curry, Ma.</i>

32
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:49,121
No, no. Now, hurry up.
Don't give me a hard time.

33
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:51,857
And this TV. I'm so sick of it!
Take this off. Hurry up.

34
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:54,399
Ma, what are you doing?
I'll do it myself.

35
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,458
What "wear it yourself"?
I'll wear it myself.

36
00:05:56,536 --> 00:05:58,697
The guests are on their way.

37
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:00,933
Did you change your underwear?
Ma!

38
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:03,168
What "Ma"? Did you?

39
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:05,643
Out with the truth! Are you wearing
dirty ones from yesterday?

40
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:10,115
- I just hope they're not smelling.
You're such a silly little boy.

41
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:12,947
"Little"?
Oh, God!

42
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:22,085
Just because India has gone global...

43
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:23,823
should we embrace everything?

44
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:25,990
<i>What about our ancient culture?</i>

45
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:28,899
<i>Our tradition? Our values?</i>

46
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:31,334
<i>You are saying
censorship is unnecessary.</i>

47
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:34,498
- Absolutely unnecessary.
- What is your response, Mr. Bhatt?

48
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:37,236
Let's take the example of America.

49
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,801
<i>This is not America.
This is India.</i>

50
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:49,485
You think just because you wear
handloom and speak in Hindi...

51
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:51,956
<i>that you represent the common man?</i>

52
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:53,253
Well, you don't.

53
00:06:53,326 --> 00:06:55,521
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome...

54
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:59,463
one of our top dubbists in Delhi,
Shivani Tanakiya.

55
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,976
- This is what the common man hears.
- So, somebody enjoying sex.

56
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:55,316
So what's the problem?

57
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:57,413
We have to take a short break,
ladies and gentlemen,

58
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,755
<i>but please stay tuned to Delhi dot com.</i>

59
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:19,007
Hi.
Hi.

60
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:28,579
How have you been?
Fine.

61
00:08:31,124 --> 00:08:33,183
Are you happy?

62
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,291
Yeah.

63
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,231
I miss you.

64
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:49,571
Oh, hi, Aditi. I'm sorry.

65
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:52,907
- We're starting in 20 seconds.
- I'll be right there.

66
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:54,674
Sorry.

67
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,611
I have to go.

68
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:09,690
Call me.

69
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:18,103
<i>Aditi, why are you doing this?
What? What am I doing?</i>

70
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:20,105
I don't think
you're ready for marriage.

71
00:09:20,173 --> 00:09:22,641
<i>I just want to settle down.
So what do you do?</i>

72
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,973
Get married to some guy
selected by Mummy and Daddy?

73
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:26,841
<i>You've known him
for a couple of weeks!</i>

74
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:29,473
You are so mature, Aditi.

75
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:33,178
I can't wait around to see if Vikram's
wife will agree to divorce him.

76
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:37,019
I've read too many magazines, Ria.
I know it may never happen.

77
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,684
<i>Do you get all your life directions
from fucking Cosmopolitan?</i>

78
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,283
Don't get superior with me.

79
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:44,421
We're family, and I can tell you
what I think, and I will.

80
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:46,192
That's right.

81
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:48,257
My older, unmarried cousin Ria.

82
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:51,829
What would she know about passion?

83
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:58,367
I didn't mean that, Didi.

84
00:09:58,444 --> 00:10:02,540
For all this talk of passion,
how about marrying for love, Aditi?

85
00:11:04,844 --> 00:11:07,938
There's a Tempo in the middle
of the driveway.

86
00:11:10,116 --> 00:11:13,517
We had to go to the tailor and then-

87
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:16,419
But people are about to arrive
and you're not dressed yet!

88
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:19,356
Come on, hurry up.
You're looking very handsome today.

89
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:22,788
Hurry up and get ready.

90
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:27,856
Take it easy.

91
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:29,902
What are you doing here?
Just chillin'.

92
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:31,903
Just chilling.
Idiot.

93
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:35,834
Hi, Mom. I'm back.

94
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:37,188
Aliya? God, what are you doing here?

95
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:45,062
You're so disgusting.
Get out now! Out!

96
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:50,508
Out!
What does this word mean?

97
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:53,374
- How come you're so irritating?
- How come you're still unmarried?

98
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:15,196
Hello, sweetie.

99
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,103
What does this word mean?

100
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:27,208
It’s "uxorious. "

101
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,010
It’s "uxorious. "
Uxorious?

102
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,633
So you are facing this way as barman?

103
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,905
I'm the barman, facing this way,
and this acts as a roof.

104
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:00,912
No need to be happy
about being the barman.

105
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,710
You're not supposed to touch
one drop of the stuff. Understand?

106
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:05,774
A barman should be absolutely sober.

107
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:09,116
Keep this list, and make sure
the servants don't swipe anything...

108
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:12,851
and make small drinks for everybody,
not too large.

109
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:15,792
The whiskey hasn't come yet!
Uday was supposed to bring it.

110
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:19,319
<i>Here he comes.
My unpunctual brother.</i>

111
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,162
<i>Good morning.</i>

112
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:25,602
<i>What do you think?</i>

113
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:27,969
We got real scotch from Uday's client.

114
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,702
- Thank you, Sona.
- Hi, Lalo Uncle.

115
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:33,142
<i>- Why aren't you staying with us?
- I have to study for my exams.</i>

116
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:35,646
I hope my little Aliya
didn't trouble you.

117
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:37,615
<i>No, she's such a little delight.</i>

118
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:46,049
<i>Pick it up and take it in.</i>

119
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,593
This is no time
for family members to arrive.

120
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:51,960
It’s only 4:00.

121
00:15:52,031 --> 00:15:54,158
<i>Just relax!</i>

122
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:57,259
Ayesha, this is C.L. Uncle
and Shashi Auntie's son Rahul.

123
00:15:57,336 --> 00:15:59,497
They live in Dubai.
Muscat, actually.

124
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:01,062
Yeah, Muscat, okay.

125
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,702
You have a tattoo.
Yeah.

126
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:26,061
Okay, bye.

127
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:40,374
I think your cousin Rahul
would really like it.

128
00:16:41,614 --> 00:16:43,275
You have to know this.

129
00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:46,284
I heard your mother tell him and sister
your bra size was 36C.

130
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:49,719
<i>- Why would she do that?
- Sorry, but it's 32A.</i>

131
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:52,121
I know that,
but we can't tell them.

132
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,094
<i>Pimmi, come on!</i>

133
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,930
The groom's here!

134
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:04,863
Oh, shit.

135
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:10,374
Welcome, welcome.

136
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:16,080
Thank you, thank you.

137
00:17:18,884 --> 00:17:21,614
This is Pimmi's brother from Muscat.

138
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:23,450
Rahul, come here!

139
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:30,788
It’s okay, it's okay.

140
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,661
Hello, young man. How are you?

141
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,970
Have you got the blue box?

142
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:53,545
So, excited?
Soon to be in family way!

143
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:01,091
So, you like India?
Yeah.

144
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:04,219
Better than Houston, no?

145
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:06,958
Good, good, good.
India needs young men like you.

146
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:12,595
<i>Yes, computer engineers
are India's biggest export.</i>

147
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:16,666
Am I a coolie or what?

148
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:20,670
<i>Bhai-sahab,
what would you like to drink?</i>

149
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:22,907
Scotch, please on the "rockiolis. "

150
00:18:22,982 --> 00:18:25,974
"Rockiolis" means ice?
Two lumps, exactly.

151
00:18:26,051 --> 00:18:27,712
Exactly.

152
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:29,652
I'll have the same, thanks.

153
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:31,747
Uh "rockioli. "

154
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:34,726
Rahul, two whiskies here.

155
00:18:34,794 --> 00:18:37,228
<i>Two cubes of ice exactly.</i>

156
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:40,459
Oh, my goodness. Look at you!

157
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:45,301
How lovely you look.

158
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:49,870
Rockioli, rockioli.
Mrs. Rai over there.

159
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:59,012
Hi. Congratulations.
Hi.

160
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:25,743
Hi.
Hi. How are you?

161
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:27,574
Fine.

162
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:41,292
I must have another drink.

163
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:51,429
<i>Rahul, idiot, come here.</i>

164
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:53,404
<i>Come here and hold
the camera. Listen.</i>

165
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:55,406
Look at them.
How handsome Hemant is.

166
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:02,345
Come on, put it on.
Camera on!

167
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,980
On the ring!

168
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,931
Thank you.

169
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,433
Just in time!

170
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,777
This is Varun?
He's almost a young man.

171
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:40,809
How did you manage? I sent Rahul
to airport, told me flight was late.

172
00:20:40,886 --> 00:20:44,686
No, it was not late. Nobody was there
at the airport, so we took a cab.

173
00:20:44,757 --> 00:20:47,555
- You had to take a cab?
- It’s okay.

174
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:49,821
Rahul, you idiot, I sent you
to the airport to receive them.

175
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:51,863
<i>You come back and tell me
the flight was late?</i>

176
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:57,435
He's been working day and night.
He doesn't know India.

177
00:20:57,503 --> 00:20:59,801
But he's number one
most stupid duffer.

178
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:02,170
I'm sorry to say,
but I don't like this!

179
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,383
<i>Bhai-sahab, this is Mr. Tej Puri,
married to my sister Vijaya.</i>

180
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:17,320
<i>After my older brother
Surinder bhai-sahab passed away...</i>

181
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:20,415
<i>Tej bhai has been
the hero of the family.</i>

182
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:24,155
He has really looked after us.
Come and meet Hemant.

183
00:21:24,229 --> 00:21:26,424
Yes. Excuse me.

184
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:28,329
Excuse me.

185
00:21:34,306 --> 00:21:36,934
You know how difficult it was
to get tickets at this time of the year?

186
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:39,773
Difficult or not, we would have brought
you here first-class if we had to.

187
00:21:39,845 --> 00:21:42,643
<i>We couldn't have had the shadi
without you, my darling sister.</i>

188
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:46,242
Nothing would have stopped us.

189
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:54,025
Ria!

190
00:21:54,093 --> 00:21:56,653
<i>Is that you? Come here.</i>

191
00:21:57,763 --> 00:22:00,425
<i>Come here, come here.</i>

192
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:08,605
God bless. Very good.

193
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,794
<i>- Paaji, would you like a cigar?
- I quit.</i>

194
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:27,335
<i>Tej bhai-sahab, I wanted
to talk to you about Ria's plans.</i>

195
00:24:27,412 --> 00:24:30,904
Ria, come here a minute, please.

196
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:34,886
<i>- Ria wants to study in America.
- Is that so?</i>

197
00:24:34,953 --> 00:24:36,682
<i>We're hoping you could give us
some advice.</i>

198
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:37,881
What do you want to do?

199
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:40,424
I'm applying
for creative writing programs.

200
00:24:40,492 --> 00:24:42,551
- She wants to be a writer.
- Very good.

201
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:45,529
Have you thought of the budget?
Where will the money will come from?

202
00:24:45,597 --> 00:24:48,760
<i>My teacher's salary?</i>

203
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:51,632
<i>Why can't she be like Aditi and do
the right thing at the right time?</i>

204
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:04,271
Absolutely! Just one book.
Who knows? It might happen.

205
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:05,714
<i>You must go to the States.</i>

206
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:08,446
<i>You know saada Umang
is also there.</i>

207
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,648
- You must give us his phone number.
- He's coming here tonight.

208
00:25:11,723 --> 00:25:14,021
We're hoping Ria and Umang
will like each other.

209
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:18,258
What are the chances
of getting hooked?

210
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,730
Bad.

211
00:25:26,672 --> 00:25:29,800
<i>Save the jokes for the sangeet.
He'll be the MC at the sangeet.</i>

212
00:26:32,037 --> 00:26:35,006
Varun, out!

213
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:37,705
What's your problem anyway?

214
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:49,479
Varun, what happened to you?

215
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:52,114
Mrs. Mehta speaking. Who's this?

216
00:26:53,225 --> 00:26:57,389
<i>Okay, okay, I have
an announcement to make.</i>

217
00:26:57,462 --> 00:27:01,193
I'm thinking that if Ria wants
to study in America...

218
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:03,359
I will fund her entire education.

219
00:27:04,736 --> 00:27:07,170
<i>No, no arguments.</i>

220
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:09,571
This is my family.

221
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:15,572
You see, Lalit,
Ria is a sensible girl.

222
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:18,673
<i>If she wants to write,
we must encourage her.</i>

223
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,015
I can still work.

224
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:25,750
This is final!
We'll talk about it later, okay?

225
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,849
Now you tell us what needs
to be done for the wedding.

226
00:27:27,926 --> 00:27:31,089
<i>Absolutely. Now you don't have
to worry about anything.</i>

227
00:27:32,931 --> 00:27:35,764
Anything.

228
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:43,738
My God, I don't know what to say.

229
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:48,041
This is enough for me
that we are all here together.

230
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:51,241
My God! Pimmi, it's wonderful, no?
After so many years.

231
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:54,046
<i>After Surinder bhai-sahab passed away...</i>

232
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:59,557
<i>I think this is the first time
the whole family's here together.</i>

233
00:28:00,592 --> 00:28:04,551
Ria, Ria, Ria.

234
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:10,091
Don't cry.
I know you are missing him.

235
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:12,864
<i>We are all missing your father.</i>

236
00:28:26,852 --> 00:28:30,049
Dubey!

237
00:28:38,397 --> 00:28:40,797
<i>Rahul, go start the generator.</i>

238
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:43,232
- I don't even know where it is.
- Behind the house, idiot!

239
00:28:43,301 --> 00:28:44,893
Come, I'll show you.

240
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:48,064
Umang?
Yeah, just hold on a sec.

241
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,904
It’s very unclear.
Hello?

242
00:28:50,976 --> 00:28:54,275
When are you arriving?

243
00:28:57,916 --> 00:29:00,180
Hello, hello?

244
00:30:32,777 --> 00:30:35,245
Think you can handle it?
Yeah, sure.

245
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:51,440
- Hi.
- Hi.

246
00:32:53,285 --> 00:32:55,310
<i>I'm glad I got some exercise.</i>

247
00:32:55,387 --> 00:32:58,322
All I've been doing is
eating and eating and eating.

248
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:02,725
I'm sorry I had to
wake you up this early...

249
00:33:02,794 --> 00:33:07,254
but this is the only time
we're gonna have on our own.

250
00:33:07,332 --> 00:33:09,892
<i>There's just so many ceremonies.</i>

251
00:33:09,968 --> 00:33:12,562
<i>And I don't even know
who's who half the time.</i>

252
00:33:12,637 --> 00:33:14,298
I know what you mean.

253
00:33:14,372 --> 00:33:17,466
I wanted to talk to you about our-
Here's the coffee, ma'am.

254
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:20,602
Thank you.
Do you want something?

255
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:23,648
<i>I'll have a salt lassi, please.
Sure, I'll get it.</i>

256
00:33:29,654 --> 00:33:32,054
<i>I want to know what's on your mind.</i>

257
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:35,718
Sleep! That's all
that's on my mind right now.

258
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,191
I saw you with your family yesterday.

259
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,763
<i>You guys are so close.</i>

260
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:48,067
<i>Sometimes...</i>

261
00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:51,939
<i>I worry about how it will be
for you in America.</i>

262
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,410
You might just feel so alone.

263
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:56,242
I'm sure I can handle it.

264
00:33:56,314 --> 00:33:59,442
It'll be really nice to get away
from this damned place.

265
00:33:59,517 --> 00:34:01,280
Why? You don't like Delhi?

266
00:34:01,353 --> 00:34:03,685
No, I love India.

267
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:07,384
<i>I mean, I don't care. America's
gonna be new for me anyway.</i>

268
00:34:07,459 --> 00:34:10,053
My fiancée.

269
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:13,359
<i>Sorry, I'm just not a morning person.</i>

270
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,465
Vicky, is it okay
if I join the four-ball today?

271
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:22,196
No, no, I'll be there 100%.

272
00:34:22,273 --> 00:34:25,333
I'll be there. Don't worry. Okay, bye.

273
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:29,208
Pimmi.

274
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:33,381
<i>Pimmi.</i>

275
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:36,477
<i>What are you doing inside?
Nothing.</i>

276
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:38,920
Nothing.
I know very well what you're doing.

277
00:34:39,524 --> 00:34:42,322
<i>Open up. I have to get ready.
Just a minute.</i>

278
00:34:47,232 --> 00:34:51,134
If you must hide and smoke,
at least use a better air freshener.

279
00:34:51,202 --> 00:34:52,760
I was a little tense.

280
00:34:52,837 --> 00:34:56,273
<i>Tense? You're going shopping!
I'm the one who should be tense.</i>

281
00:34:56,341 --> 00:35:00,107
I'm doing it for our darling daughter.
You saw how much they gave us.

282
00:35:00,178 --> 00:35:02,271
We can't look bad
in front of our in-laws.

283
00:35:02,347 --> 00:35:04,315
We'll look good with you
smoking in front of them.

284
00:35:04,382 --> 00:35:07,408
Well, doesn't Saroj drink?

285
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:09,783
Anyway, just let me go
and do it, okay?

286
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:12,379
<i>Well, Pimmi goes shopping again.</i>

287
00:35:12,457 --> 00:35:14,948
And I'm telling you,
it's gonna cost us.

288
00:35:15,026 --> 00:35:17,824
<i>So what? I'll arrange the money like
I've been organizing everything else.</i>

289
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:23,056
<i>You've organized everything else?</i>

290
00:35:23,134 --> 00:35:26,592
Who's been nonstop on her toes
for days? Just tell me that.

291
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,843
Thank you so much
for working so hard.

292
00:35:35,914 --> 00:35:38,348
<i>Take off your curlers at least!</i>

293
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:26,695
Alice.
Alice.

294
00:37:21,553 --> 00:37:23,077
Email?

295
00:39:44,762 --> 00:39:47,458
Shit! Dubey!

296
00:39:53,638 --> 00:39:54,730
Yes, sir?

297
00:39:57,341 --> 00:40:00,833
<i>Yes, sir?
Dubey.</i>

298
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,643
Yes sir.
What's this "yes sir"?

299
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:24,927
Okay.

300
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:49,618
Advance? What for?

301
00:40:49,694 --> 00:40:51,559
Waterproofing, meaning more money.

302
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:23,852
Five thousand dollars.
Exactly and approximately.

303
00:41:58,696 --> 00:42:02,097
Thank God it's air-conditioned.

304
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:04,031
<i>Mom, I'm just going to have a chuski.</i>

305
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:08,663
Just one.

306
00:42:30,595 --> 00:42:32,392
By God, it's fabulous!

307
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:47,576
Aditi.

308
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,573
What are you doing? They're
waiting for your approval inside.

309
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:57,748
I don't really know how Hemant thinks,
what he expects of me.

310
00:42:57,822 --> 00:42:59,653
So call him instead of Vikram.

311
00:42:59,724 --> 00:43:03,182
Now go inside before those aunties come
and dance on our head.

312
00:43:04,428 --> 00:43:06,225
Thank you.

313
00:43:11,903 --> 00:43:14,770
Hey, you want a lift, baby?

314
00:43:29,787 --> 00:43:31,812
Aliya, go and sit.

315
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:40,956
<i>We can try the sitting step,
and then the chunri khenchna step.</i>

316
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,815
Hi, sexy.

317
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:08,152
So, Sydney boy, can you move to this?

318
00:44:17,702 --> 00:44:19,567
What's going on, guys?

319
00:44:24,408 --> 00:44:26,069
<i>Come on, didi. That's enough.</i>

320
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,072
God.

321
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:35,444
Not more interruptions!
We'll never get this right.

322
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:38,886
<i>What is it, Rahul? We're rehearsing
for the sangeet. What do you want?</i>

323
00:47:32,396 --> 00:47:35,593
Lalit and Sam are partners,
and Vicky and me.

324
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:37,600
<i>Let's take them on, partner.</i>

325
00:47:39,503 --> 00:47:41,971
<i>That's a great shot, partner.</i>

326
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:45,372
<i>Thanks, Rajeev.
Great shot there. Good shooting.</i>

327
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:47,706
Thank God we're partners.

328
00:47:47,778 --> 00:47:49,973
I have to talk to you
about something, Rajeev.

329
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,217
Rajeev, I was wondering if-
How's Pimmi?

330
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,383
She's fine.
How are the preparations going?

331
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:03,585
Preparations? First-class.

332
00:48:03,661 --> 00:48:08,689
<i>But, Sam, I'm having
a cash-flow problem.</i>

333
00:48:08,766 --> 00:48:12,167
I was hoping to borrow some money
just to tide over this wedding expense.

334
00:48:15,806 --> 00:48:17,740
When do you think you'll be able
to return it, partner?

335
00:48:17,808 --> 00:48:21,141
Next month. I have a huge shipment
going to Macy's next month.

336
00:48:21,212 --> 00:48:26,115
Hey, guys, Mr. Verma here has got
some serious cash-flow problems.

337
00:48:28,686 --> 00:48:31,678
Thank God I don't have any
daughters

338
00:48:31,755 --> 00:48:35,885
<i>- You've got a high-maintenance wife.
- But she's a self-financed Maharani.</i>

339
00:48:39,263 --> 00:48:41,823
<i>O women of the house</i>

340
00:48:41,899 --> 00:48:43,867
Decorate me with henna

341
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:46,888
Hey, idiot, come on!
Let's enter the harem!

342
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,654
<i>Arre, ladies!</i>

343
00:50:54,665 --> 00:50:59,728
C.L. has an item which is
most suitable for ladies. Please!

344
00:51:09,747 --> 00:51:13,649
So, Varun, enjoying yourself
among all the women?

345
00:51:26,997 --> 00:51:30,592
<i>Be a good girl. Don't say no.</i>

346
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:33,966
<i>Open your mouth.
Do you like it?</i>

347
00:51:35,072 --> 00:51:36,972
<i>Be a good girl
and open your mouth.</i>

348
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,974
<i>There's only this much left.</i>

349
00:51:40,878 --> 00:51:42,869
Hi.
Hi. What?

350
00:51:42,946 --> 00:51:45,141
<i>Hi. Nice mehndi, Ria.</i>

351
00:51:49,286 --> 00:51:51,311
She's angry, eh?

352
00:51:54,258 --> 00:51:57,455
<i>Okay. Ria didi will give you
samosa, okay?</i>

353
00:52:01,532 --> 00:52:03,591
<i>- What were you doing here?
- Eating a big samosa.</i>

354
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:05,157
<i>Why?
Because I'm hungry.</i>

355
00:52:05,235 --> 00:52:08,329
<i>- No, why are you eating it here?
- Because the samosas were in here.</i>

356
00:52:08,405 --> 00:52:10,270
<i>Why was he with you, Aliya?
Who?</i>

357
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,500
<i>Tej Uncle.</i>

358
00:52:11,575 --> 00:52:14,544
<i>Alice said the samosas
were on the top shelf...</i>

359
00:52:14,611 --> 00:52:18,377
and Tej Uncle came
to get the box down for me.

360
00:52:20,484 --> 00:52:23,419
<i>Okay, let's do a nakkushi.</i>

361
00:52:23,487 --> 00:52:27,218
<i>I love you, Ria didi.
I love you too, my baby.</i>

362
00:52:49,947 --> 00:52:50,936
Alice.

363
00:52:57,688 --> 00:52:58,677
Alice.

364
00:54:59,843 --> 00:55:02,334
You know, Pimmi...

365
00:55:02,412 --> 00:55:05,074
sometimes when I look at them...

366
00:55:07,317 --> 00:55:13,222
I feel love which I almost cannot bear.

367
00:55:25,902 --> 00:55:29,133
And when did we grow old?

368
00:55:59,169 --> 00:56:01,865
If only their lives are happy.

369
00:56:06,176 --> 00:56:11,170
For that I'm willing to take on every
trouble, every sorrow, in the world.

370
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:42,140
<i>- Need anything, beta?
- I'm all right, thanks.</i>

371
00:56:42,212 --> 00:56:44,203
Good night.

372
00:56:45,348 --> 00:56:47,009
Good night, idiot.

373
00:56:54,257 --> 00:56:56,589
I thought you weren't staying here.

374
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,493
I changed my mind.

375
00:56:59,563 --> 00:57:01,463
Really?

376
00:57:01,498 --> 00:57:04,228
How come you're not asleep as yet?

377
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:08,162
Just thinking.

378
00:57:08,238 --> 00:57:10,729
About what?

379
00:57:10,774 --> 00:57:12,969
About good Indian girls.

380
00:57:27,858 --> 00:57:31,191
Is this a scorpion?
Yeah. It’s my sign.

381
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:47,569
I should go.
It’s okay.

382
00:58:18,141 --> 00:58:20,701
I should really go.
Don't go.

383
00:58:20,777 --> 00:58:22,711
Please don't.

384
00:58:38,662 --> 00:58:40,323
Idiot.

385
00:59:06,756 --> 00:59:08,747
Where would you like to go?

386
00:59:09,726 --> 00:59:13,753
I just want to drive
and drive and drive.

387
00:59:50,867 --> 00:59:52,801
Why did you come to see me?

388
00:59:54,037 --> 00:59:56,096
I...

389
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:01,208
wanted to be reminded
why I broke up with you.

390
01:00:26,569 --> 01:00:29,367
Somehow...

391
01:00:29,439 --> 01:00:31,373
I can't remember.

392
01:00:46,423 --> 01:00:49,688
<i>What is it?</i>

393
01:00:51,528 --> 01:00:54,019
What is it?

394
01:01:02,205 --> 01:01:04,673
Take me to the police station?
On what basis?

395
01:01:04,741 --> 01:01:08,973
Indecent exposure.
Obscenity.

396
01:01:11,581 --> 01:01:14,209
<i>Don't be ridiculous!
Do we look like terrorists?</i>

397
01:01:34,471 --> 01:01:36,496
Hello, darling.

398
01:01:41,311 --> 01:01:43,506
Yes, I know that.
I'll be home soon.

399
01:01:48,918 --> 01:01:52,513
There was an emergency. Yes.

400
01:01:52,589 --> 01:01:55,649
No, don't worry. That's just
a television show in the background.

401
01:01:55,725 --> 01:01:58,057
Vikram, don't leave me with them.

402
01:02:16,446 --> 01:02:19,415
What are you doing?

403
01:02:58,455 --> 01:03:00,184
Lalit.

404
01:03:06,796 --> 01:03:08,991
Let me sleep, will you?

405
01:04:39,622 --> 01:04:41,385
So what are you
going to say to Hemant?

406
01:04:41,457 --> 01:04:44,187
- Everything.
- Oh, God. Then?

407
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:47,354
He's gonna tell me I'm a slut
and that I should get lost.

408
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:49,557
<i>Adu.</i>

409
01:04:49,632 --> 01:04:51,896
How could I have been so stupid?

410
01:04:51,968 --> 01:04:54,027
Are you sure you want
to tell Hemant everything?

411
01:04:54,103 --> 01:04:56,571
<i>Everything's over
between you and Vikram now.</i>

412
01:04:57,707 --> 01:05:01,302
Ria, I don't want to lie.

413
01:05:01,377 --> 01:05:05,746
I don't want to start something new
based on lies and deceit.

414
01:05:05,815 --> 01:05:09,012
It’s just so wrong.

415
01:05:09,085 --> 01:05:12,680
You liked Hemant, no?
Yeah.

416
01:05:12,755 --> 01:05:14,586
He's nice.

417
01:05:14,657 --> 01:05:16,921
He's good for you.

418
01:05:16,993 --> 01:05:19,587
I can't do this to him.

419
01:05:21,664 --> 01:05:24,565
I'm going mad!
What is this music?

420
01:05:24,634 --> 01:05:27,535
<i>It’s Ayesha practicing
for the sangeet tonight.</i>

421
01:05:28,538 --> 01:05:31,098
Maybe she shouldn't bother.
What?

422
01:05:31,174 --> 01:05:34,871
<i>- Maybe she shouldn't bother.
- Adu!</i>

423
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:45,282
I'm really glad you called...

424
01:05:45,355 --> 01:05:47,152
because I was gonna
call you myself this morning.

425
01:05:47,223 --> 01:05:49,953
Why? What happened?
Nothing happened.

426
01:05:50,026 --> 01:05:52,494
It was great
to see you alone yesterday...

427
01:05:52,562 --> 01:05:55,156
so I thought I'd try my luck again.

428
01:05:56,232 --> 01:05:59,133
You look really nice when you laugh.
Oh, yeah?

429
01:06:03,072 --> 01:06:05,404
I need to tell you something.

430
01:06:05,475 --> 01:06:07,568
You'll probably hate me
by the end of it...

431
01:06:11,581 --> 01:06:13,412
but I really need you to know.

432
01:06:13,483 --> 01:06:17,249
It’s okay.
I'm not gonna hate you.

433
01:06:20,857 --> 01:06:23,587
This used to be my favorite haunt
during my IIT days.

434
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:25,594
<i>Best chai in the world.</i>

435
01:06:25,662 --> 01:06:28,722
It’s nice.
Yeah? I was hoping you'd like it.

436
01:07:01,998 --> 01:07:05,764
So, what was so important?

437
01:07:05,835 --> 01:07:08,030
You don't want to marry me anymore?

438
01:07:12,809 --> 01:07:14,276
Just look at these.

439
01:07:14,344 --> 01:07:16,209
Mama gave these to me
when I got married.

440
01:07:16,279 --> 01:07:19,009
Still so shiny and beautiful.

441
01:07:19,082 --> 01:07:21,642
I never used them once.

442
01:07:21,718 --> 01:07:23,652
I just hope Aditi will use them.

443
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,813
<i>Pimmi, what have you spread all over?</i>

444
01:07:25,888 --> 01:07:28,288
I have to do my accounts
and I can't even find my papers.

445
01:07:28,358 --> 01:07:31,225
- Please don't keep this stuff here.
- Then get a computer.

446
01:07:31,294 --> 01:07:32,989
You won't need any paper.

447
01:07:33,062 --> 01:07:35,053
Computers can do everything
for you these days.

448
01:07:35,131 --> 01:07:37,395
I'm too old to learn
all this computer nonsense.

449
01:07:37,467 --> 01:07:40,595
<i>And you know how much money
has already got spent?</i>

450
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:42,900
You know how long it will take me
to repay all this?

451
01:07:42,972 --> 01:07:44,872
Don't worry so much, Lalit.

452
01:07:44,941 --> 01:07:47,000
Our only daughter's getting married.

453
01:07:47,076 --> 01:07:49,340
<i>Nothing's a waste.</i>

454
01:07:50,346 --> 01:07:52,177
Look at these saris.

455
01:07:52,248 --> 01:07:55,274
You know I bought this one
in Madras 22 years ago?

456
01:07:56,219 --> 01:07:59,450
I've been collecting these
since the day Aditi was born.

457
01:08:00,957 --> 01:08:03,585
This one is lovely.

458
01:08:06,696 --> 01:08:10,097
And tomorrow she'll be gone.

459
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:12,760
Just like that, in one day.

460
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,075
I'm sorry.

461
01:08:31,421 --> 01:08:34,322
Yeah, I'm sorry too.

462
01:09:41,591 --> 01:09:44,287
Couldn't help yourself, huh?

463
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:47,761
You had to drag me into your mess
as well. What am I supposed to do now?

464
01:09:49,499 --> 01:09:52,900
Mr. Verma, your daughter's
such a rosebud.

465
01:09:52,969 --> 01:09:55,437
We'll have a wonderful family
in Houston, Texas...

466
01:09:55,505 --> 01:09:57,905
<i>be friends,
take our kids to Disneyland...</i>

467
01:09:57,974 --> 01:09:59,771
<i>send you tickets every year.</i>

468
01:09:59,842 --> 01:10:01,469
It'll be lovely!

469
01:10:01,544 --> 01:10:03,102
But, hey, wait a minute.

470
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:05,545
You didn't tell me she's still
screwing her ex-boyfriend...

471
01:10:05,615 --> 01:10:08,709
while you were fixing
her marriage.

472
01:10:08,784 --> 01:10:12,151
But that shouldn't be a problem.
I'm from America. We'll fit right in.

473
01:10:15,124 --> 01:10:17,558
I've been thinking, Lalit.

474
01:10:17,627 --> 01:10:20,061
I don't want to send Varun
to boarding school.

475
01:10:20,129 --> 01:10:22,825
- Don't start again.
- I don't want to lose both my children.

476
01:10:22,899 --> 01:10:25,390
Don't start over again, huh?
We've been through all this.

477
01:10:25,468 --> 01:10:28,096
He's going to boarding school,
and that's final.

478
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:30,832
He's wasting his life, staying here
watching TV the whole day.

479
01:10:31,641 --> 01:10:33,506
<i>There's no one here to discipline him.</i>

480
01:10:33,576 --> 01:10:36,374
I don't know what to do.

481
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:39,175
He also needs love and affection.

482
01:10:39,248 --> 01:10:41,682
He's such a sensitive boy...

483
01:10:41,751 --> 01:10:45,084
and he's so wonderful
with all these creative things.

484
01:10:45,688 --> 01:10:48,418
Creative things like
singing and dancing.

485
01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:50,721
cooking sesame chicken.

486
01:10:52,495 --> 01:10:55,760
Don't say that. Why do you always
look at everything like that?

487
01:10:55,831 --> 01:10:58,698
<i>You know what he told Tej bhai-sahab
he wants to be when he grows up?</i>

488
01:10:58,768 --> 01:11:01,202
What?
He said he wants to be a chef.

489
01:11:02,204 --> 01:11:05,367
I tell you.

490
01:11:07,843 --> 01:11:09,401
<i>A cook!</i>

491
01:11:09,478 --> 01:11:12,936
It doesn't mean anything.

492
01:11:13,015 --> 01:11:14,448
He's a fool.

493
01:11:14,517 --> 01:11:16,485
My son will be a man
when he grows up, understand?

494
01:11:16,552 --> 01:11:19,112
He'll be an educated professional.

495
01:11:19,188 --> 01:11:21,247
<i>He won't be singing and dancing
in people's shadis.</i>

496
01:11:21,324 --> 01:11:23,952
Mama.

497
01:11:24,026 --> 01:11:26,620
<i>Can you do this for me?
Make a mucchi and on my eyes?</i>

498
01:11:26,696 --> 01:11:29,256
<i>Why, beta?
For my dance with Ayesha tonight.</i>

499
01:11:29,332 --> 01:11:30,924
<i>Okay.</i>

500
01:11:33,069 --> 01:11:35,629
<i>Why can't you do something useful?</i>

501
01:11:35,705 --> 01:11:39,402
Like some exercise or reading
your schoolbooks for a change.

502
01:11:39,475 --> 01:11:41,136
Look at you, a big huge hulk.

503
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:43,337
<i>Can't spend your whole life
singing and dancing.</i>

504
01:11:43,412 --> 01:11:46,472
- Why not?
- What do you mean, why not?

505
01:11:49,118 --> 01:11:51,552
You don't do any exercise.
You don't even play cricket.

506
01:11:51,621 --> 01:11:54,283
You don't read a book. Just sleeping
all day and watching TV...

507
01:11:54,357 --> 01:11:56,257
and now this new nonsense, dancing!

508
01:11:56,325 --> 01:11:59,817
<i>Why? You also took Mama's dupatta
and danced the night.</i>

509
01:11:59,895 --> 01:12:01,658
Don't compare yourself with me.
You're just a kid.

510
01:12:01,731 --> 01:12:03,631
But right now
you said I'm big now.

511
01:12:04,767 --> 01:12:07,258
That's it. You're going
to boarding school. Decided!

512
01:12:07,336 --> 01:12:08,360
Since when?

513
01:12:08,437 --> 01:12:10,667
<i>Beta, Papa and I
are only talking about it.</i>

514
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:13,106
No, I have made up my mind.
We are not-

515
01:12:13,175 --> 01:12:14,972
Let me talk to him.

516
01:12:15,044 --> 01:12:16,602
<i>It’s going to be good for you.</i>

517
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:20,171
Soon Aditi's going away.
You'll be so lonely at home.

518
01:12:20,249 --> 01:12:23,650
So we thought you'd go to boarding
school. You'll have so much fun.

519
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:26,483
You also have been trying
to send me away to boarding school.

520
01:12:26,555 --> 01:12:28,682
<i>No, beta.</i>

521
01:12:31,527 --> 01:12:33,654
That school is much better
than this school.

522
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:35,856
We thought you'll go there and
there'll be so many boys your age.

523
01:12:35,931 --> 01:12:38,195
- You'll really enjoy yourself.
- No, I don't want to go.

524
01:12:38,267 --> 01:12:40,360
I won't go.
You do what you want.

525
01:12:40,436 --> 01:12:42,404
<i>We're just doing this
for your own good.</i>

526
01:12:42,471 --> 01:12:45,201
It'll make you a bit tougher.
It'll be good for you.

527
01:12:45,274 --> 01:12:47,606
I hate you!
I hate you both!

528
01:12:47,677 --> 01:12:49,804
You don't even understand
one thing about me.

529
01:12:49,879 --> 01:12:51,847
Don't you talk to me like that!

530
01:12:51,914 --> 01:12:54,144
Fine! I just won't talk to you at all.

531
01:12:54,216 --> 01:12:55,843
Varun.
No.

532
01:12:55,918 --> 01:12:59,251
<i>Please, son,
Leave me alone.</i>

533
01:13:02,925 --> 01:13:05,553
Happy now?
Happy with what you've done?

534
01:13:05,628 --> 01:13:08,062
I didn't mean
to upset him like that.

535
01:13:09,365 --> 01:13:11,731
Why couldn't you say something?

536
01:13:11,801 --> 01:13:15,032
Don't talk to me, okay?
Just don't talk to me.

537
01:14:21,137 --> 01:14:23,196
Aditi.

538
01:14:25,975 --> 01:14:27,909
I'm sorry I lost it out there.

539
01:14:27,977 --> 01:14:30,969
I didn't have any right
to talk to you like that.

540
01:14:31,046 --> 01:14:33,640
You had every reason to be angry.

541
01:14:34,984 --> 01:14:37,475
Someone broke my heart too
a few years ago.

542
01:14:37,553 --> 01:14:42,422
I know how hard
and confusing it can be.

543
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:47,788
I really appreciate
your telling me about Vikram.

544
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:50,923
You didn't have to but you did.

545
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,764
That honesty means a lot to me.

546
01:14:53,836 --> 01:14:57,397
I know it's a risk,
but what marriage isn't a risk?

547
01:14:57,473 --> 01:14:59,839
Whether our parents introduce us
or we meet in a club...

548
01:14:59,909 --> 01:15:02,434
what difference does it make?

549
01:15:13,189 --> 01:15:15,180
I know we can put this behind us.

550
01:15:16,592 --> 01:15:18,355
I really do.

551
01:15:19,795 --> 01:15:22,423
I believe this can work.

552
01:15:23,766 --> 01:15:26,360
I believe we can be happy.

553
01:15:26,435 --> 01:15:29,836
As for the question of whether
we should get married or not...

554
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,704
it's really for you to answer.

555
01:18:55,644 --> 01:18:58,670
Here's yours.
Especially my mom.

556
01:19:00,249 --> 01:19:02,046
Yeah, exactly. Sure.

557
01:19:02,117 --> 01:19:04,847
How are you?
Very well. How are you doing?

558
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:10,119
Ladies and gentlemen,
attention, please.

559
01:19:10,192 --> 01:19:12,092
Welcome...

560
01:19:12,161 --> 01:19:15,597
beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful ladies...

561
01:19:15,664 --> 01:19:17,188
and gentlemen...

562
01:19:17,266 --> 01:19:20,827
and, of course, lovely children.

563
01:19:20,903 --> 01:19:25,135
<i>Today's sangeet
for our beloved Aditi...</i>

564
01:19:25,207 --> 01:19:29,644
<i>and our dear son.
Son-in-law!</i>

565
01:19:31,246 --> 01:19:34,079
and marriage will
take place tomorrow.

566
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:38,085
Rahul, Rahul.

567
01:19:38,153 --> 01:19:40,121
Are you the only bartender here?

568
01:19:40,189 --> 01:19:42,248
I ordered a Bacardi Coke
20 minutes ago.

569
01:19:42,324 --> 01:19:44,155
- Just a second.
- Rahul.

570
01:19:44,226 --> 01:19:47,923
<i>- Gin and tonic, no ice, lots of gin.
- Make that two.</i>

571
01:19:47,996 --> 01:19:49,122
Sure.

572
01:19:59,808 --> 01:20:04,438
Move, man.
Sorry. Chill.

573
01:20:07,349 --> 01:20:11,251
Welcome.

574
01:20:18,193 --> 01:20:20,286
Who's that clown?

575
01:20:20,362 --> 01:20:22,262
That's my dad.

576
01:20:22,331 --> 01:20:25,823
Varun, you can't say no now.
Please, Varun!

577
01:20:25,901 --> 01:20:29,598
Listen,

578
01:20:29,671 --> 01:20:31,332
Varun, please.

579
01:20:31,406 --> 01:20:33,840
I told you, I don't care
about anything anymore.

580
01:20:33,909 --> 01:20:37,106
I don't care, and that's decided.

581
01:20:45,521 --> 01:20:49,218
In my opinion, you Punjabis
are way too ostentatious.

582
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:52,886
In my opinion, you Bengalis
are way too pretentious.

583
01:20:52,961 --> 01:20:55,521
Touche, Ria.
This is Jibesh, Vandana.

584
01:20:55,597 --> 01:20:58,225
This is Mrs. Rai,
Aditi's ma-in-law to be.

585
01:21:05,774 --> 01:21:08,743
- Ria, get me a rum and Coke.
- Please go get it yourself.

586
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:12,871
Please. I would, but I know
so many people who know my parents.

587
01:21:12,948 --> 01:21:15,508
<i>Please, just get it.</i>

588
01:21:15,584 --> 01:21:18,644
<i>- We will start this evening...
- Okay.</i>

589
01:21:20,789 --> 01:21:22,916
with a spectacular item...

590
01:21:22,991 --> 01:21:27,428
by our own beloved Ayesha.

591
01:21:30,098 --> 01:21:32,658
What's the matter?
Varun won't do the dance anymore.

592
01:21:32,734 --> 01:21:37,103
Shit. I'm so sorry to hear that.
I don't know what to do-

593
01:21:37,172 --> 01:21:40,539
Rahul, you can do it. You've seen us
rehearse the steps so many times.

594
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:42,941
- You're crazy!
- You can make up the steps as we go.

595
01:21:43,011 --> 01:21:44,501
You said you love to dance.

596
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:46,548
Please, I'm begging you.
I need your help.

597
01:21:46,615 --> 01:21:49,550
I can dance, but it's not
a nightclub in Melbourne, you know.

598
01:21:49,618 --> 01:21:51,882
I can't dance to this music.

599
01:21:51,954 --> 01:21:54,081
You're such a

600
01:21:57,659 --> 01:21:59,251
I just fell from grace.

601
01:21:59,328 --> 01:22:02,195
Darling, you have to be standing up
in order to be able to fall.

602
01:22:02,264 --> 01:22:06,223
If you keep sitting on your ass,
nothing's gonna happen.

603
01:22:17,379 --> 01:22:20,610
Meaning, sweetheart,
the main thing is...

604
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:23,147
you have to fight the battle.

605
01:23:29,518 --> 01:23:31,816
Come on, girl, that's it!

606
01:25:24,366 --> 01:25:27,767
Nobody is to sit.
Everybody come and dance!

607
01:26:06,775 --> 01:26:08,800
Come on.

608
01:27:31,693 --> 01:27:33,684
Let's stay up all night together.

609
01:27:36,164 --> 01:27:39,497
Really. Let's talk.

610
01:27:39,568 --> 01:27:42,731
Talk?
Why would you want to talk?

611
01:28:18,707 --> 01:28:20,675
Alice.

612
01:28:59,414 --> 01:29:01,678
<i>Here comes my kissing cousin, Aditi.</i>

613
01:29:04,019 --> 01:29:06,715
<i>Hi, lovebirds.
Okay, okay.</i>

614
01:29:06,788 --> 01:29:09,313
I can only handle
one woman at a time.

615
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:10,858
Oh, really?

616
01:29:12,327 --> 01:29:14,989
<i>Don't tire yourself out.
Tomorrow's the big night.</i>

617
01:29:15,063 --> 01:29:17,691
And don't corrupt
my elder sister, huh?

618
01:29:32,947 --> 01:29:35,245
I don't like kissing.

619
01:29:35,316 --> 01:29:39,047
Typical man.

620
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,419
No, I get so confused about what to do.
Does your tongue go right in?

621
01:29:42,490 --> 01:29:44,685
<i>Does it move around?
Does it stay still?</i>

622
01:29:44,759 --> 01:29:48,752
<i>- Makes me too nervous.
- Don't think. Just go with the flow.</i>

623
01:29:50,565 --> 01:29:53,090
<i>Don't think?
I wish I could do that.</i>

624
01:29:53,168 --> 01:29:55,227
<i>Kissing could be great...</i>

625
01:29:55,303 --> 01:29:57,771
but my mind starts whizzing
with the weirdest thoughts...

626
01:29:57,839 --> 01:30:02,242
<i>and suddenly I'm thinking of some banal,
practical thing to take care of.</i>

627
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:05,370
I don't know what the big deal is.
I know all about kissing.

628
01:30:05,447 --> 01:30:08,245
<i>- Really, baby?
- Accha. Everything?</i>

629
01:30:08,316 --> 01:30:10,181
Yeah, what's the big deal?

630
01:30:10,251 --> 01:30:11,445
No big deal.
It’s gross.

631
01:30:11,519 --> 01:30:14,386
You open your mouth
and he sticks his tongue in.

632
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:18,949
Don't you know?
That's how older people kiss.

633
01:30:23,898 --> 01:30:25,957
<i>Let's go. I feel exhausted.</i>

634
01:30:29,738 --> 01:30:32,366
Bye.
See you, Varun.

635
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:51,425
Mama, I want to sleep.

636
01:31:04,539 --> 01:31:06,268
Yeah, Mr. Culkin, one moment.

637
01:31:14,649 --> 01:31:16,480
I'll go help, huh?

638
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:24,515
She's so sleepy.

639
01:31:24,592 --> 01:31:27,459
I'll take her out for a drive, okay?

640
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:33,800
<i>I don't want ice cream.</i>

641
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:40,835
<i>Strawberry ice cream?</i>

642
01:31:42,243 --> 01:31:45,235
She's tired and cranky.
I thought I'd take her out for a drive.

643
01:31:47,348 --> 01:31:49,282
Yeah, sorry.

644
01:31:50,585 --> 01:31:53,748
Ria?
Ria, what's happening?

645
01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:13,799
- What's the matter, Ria?
- Just let her go.

646
01:32:17,712 --> 01:32:20,476
Let her go from what?
From you, you bastard!

647
01:32:20,548 --> 01:32:24,746
- Ria, have you gone mad?
- Maybe she's had too much to drink.

648
01:32:26,387 --> 01:32:28,446
What happened?

649
01:32:28,523 --> 01:32:31,890
It wasn't enough that he touched me
when I was a girl?

650
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,655
You had to teach Aliya
how older people kiss?

651
01:32:33,728 --> 01:32:36,196
- Ria, stop this nonsense.
- What did you get out of it?

652
01:32:36,264 --> 01:32:39,165
I didn't even have breasts,
you sick man!

653
01:32:42,237 --> 01:32:44,034
Seven afternoons.

654
01:32:44,105 --> 01:32:46,835
Seven afternoons
of how older people kiss?

655
01:32:46,908 --> 01:32:48,739
<i>Ria.
You took my clothes off.</i>

656
01:32:48,810 --> 01:32:50,437
Ria stop!
Open your mouth Ria.

657
01:32:50,511 --> 01:32:52,274
Will you stop it?
Don't touch me!

658
01:32:52,347 --> 01:32:54,440
Don't touch me!

659
01:32:55,516 --> 01:32:57,245
Now he's doing it
all over again to Aliya.

660
01:32:57,318 --> 01:32:59,218
She's lying, Lalit. She's lying.

661
01:33:00,822 --> 01:33:02,687
<i>You don't want to believe me?</i>

662
01:33:02,757 --> 01:33:05,851
Then fine.
I'm not a part of this.

663
01:33:08,096 --> 01:33:10,030
I'm not a part of you.

664
01:33:11,599 --> 01:33:15,296
<i>Say something, Lalit.
She's lying!</i>

665
01:33:15,370 --> 01:33:17,099
<i>You know I don't lie, chachu.</i>

666
01:33:17,171 --> 01:33:20,299
<i>You know it!
You know I don't lie!</i>

667
01:33:21,609 --> 01:33:23,338
<i>She's lying, Lalit.</i>

668
01:33:23,411 --> 01:33:25,971
Unmarried girls like Ria,
they make up all these fantasies.

669
01:33:26,047 --> 01:33:27,776
Ria, Ria.

670
01:33:27,849 --> 01:33:29,612
Ria.

671
01:33:29,684 --> 01:33:32,209
Ria, you can't go away like this.
Please.

672
01:33:39,661 --> 01:33:42,255
She's mad!

673
01:33:46,367 --> 01:33:48,392
The girl's going crazy!

674
01:33:53,508 --> 01:33:55,442
Lalit.

675
01:34:24,772 --> 01:34:27,639
Please, Mama.

676
01:37:13,107 --> 01:37:15,041
Ria?

677
01:37:18,045 --> 01:37:19,876
Ria?

678
01:37:24,118 --> 01:37:26,177
<i>Ria.</i>

679
01:37:34,695 --> 01:37:37,061
<i>Come. I want you to come home
with me just now...</i>

680
01:37:37,131 --> 01:37:39,622
<i>and I don't want to listen
to anything, please.</i>

681
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:41,634
Just change your clothes
and come home with me.

682
01:37:41,702 --> 01:37:45,399
- I'll wait for you in the other room.
- Don't pretend like nothing happened.

683
01:37:45,473 --> 01:37:47,338
Ria, I'm not pretending.
You are, you are!

684
01:37:47,408 --> 01:37:49,968
I don't even know how to console you.

685
01:37:52,013 --> 01:37:54,379
What you have gone through,
I can't even imagine it.

686
01:38:01,322 --> 01:38:03,483
Ria, if you don't come home...

687
01:38:08,829 --> 01:38:10,660
<i>Come home, Ria.</i>

688
01:38:11,732 --> 01:38:14,997
I don't even know what to do.

689
01:38:16,771 --> 01:38:19,331
I don't know what to do, Ria.

690
01:38:19,407 --> 01:38:21,341
My hands are tied.

691
01:38:21,409 --> 01:38:25,607
<i>Tej bhai-sahab and our family
goes back a very long way.</i>

692
01:38:33,921 --> 01:38:35,718
Then why are you punishing me?

693
01:38:35,790 --> 01:38:39,157
<i>I'm not.
And your sister and your mother?</i>

694
01:38:39,227 --> 01:38:43,254
<i>Listen to me.
I cannot break up my family.</i>

695
01:38:44,332 --> 01:38:46,129
<i>I cannot.</i>

696
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,691
<i>Please don't ask me
to make that choice.</i>

697
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:55,037
<i>I don't know what Surinder bhai-sahab
would have done in my position.</i>

698
01:38:55,109 --> 01:38:57,600
I know I can never
replace your father...

699
01:38:57,678 --> 01:39:00,078
but you're my child now.

700
01:39:04,518 --> 01:39:07,510
My family means everything to me.

701
01:39:09,156 --> 01:39:10,987
Please don't leave us.

702
01:39:13,294 --> 01:39:14,886
Please.

703
01:39:17,698 --> 01:39:19,689
Ria, if you go...

704
01:39:47,395 --> 01:39:49,955
- What's your name, little girl?
- Aliya.

705
01:39:54,335 --> 01:39:57,600
<i>Very nice.
Look up. Smile.</i>

706
01:39:57,672 --> 01:39:59,663
Okay, smile.

707
01:40:00,708 --> 01:40:04,007
<i>Very nice. Beautiful.
What a lovely family.</i>

708
01:40:05,079 --> 01:40:07,547
<i>What's your name, please?</i>

709
01:40:07,615 --> 01:40:10,345
Ria.

710
01:40:10,418 --> 01:40:12,784
Come in front.

711
01:40:25,633 --> 01:40:27,225
Hold it.

712
01:40:27,301 --> 01:40:29,098
<i>Eyes wide open...</i>

713
01:40:29,170 --> 01:40:31,195
<i>and one, two-</i>

714
01:40:31,272 --> 01:40:34,366
Everybody now, smile together,
and watch the birdie.

715
01:40:36,277 --> 01:40:38,745
<i>And three. Very good.</i>

716
01:40:38,813 --> 01:40:41,577
<i>Okay, last picture.
Big smile, please.</i>

717
01:40:43,184 --> 01:40:45,015
Okay, thank you.

718
01:41:00,101 --> 01:41:02,501
I miss you so much, Papa.

719
01:42:20,414 --> 01:42:22,314
<i>I'll go out and receive the guests.
No.</i>

720
01:42:29,223 --> 01:42:31,589
I can't do this.

721
01:42:31,659 --> 01:42:33,354
I can't. I'm sorry.

722
01:42:33,427 --> 01:42:37,864
Lalit.
I don't even want you here. Please.

723
01:42:37,932 --> 01:42:41,993
<i>I cannot allow this, bhai.</i>

724
01:42:42,069 --> 01:42:43,866
I cannot.

725
01:42:44,872 --> 01:42:48,672
Both of you just leave my home
and my family and go.

726
01:42:48,742 --> 01:42:51,768
- Lalit, what are you say-
- I don't want to say any more.

727
01:42:51,846 --> 01:42:53,541
<i>Please don't make it worse.</i>

728
01:42:53,614 --> 01:42:58,347
No, I don't want to say anything.
Please don't make it worse.

729
01:43:01,388 --> 01:43:03,049
<i>These are my children, raji...</i>

730
01:43:04,058 --> 01:43:07,027
and I will protect them
from myself even if I have to.

731
01:43:07,094 --> 01:43:08,823
Please go.
