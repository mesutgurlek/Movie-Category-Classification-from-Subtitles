1
00:02:05,773 --> 00:02:07,817
My name is Don Juan DeMarco...

2
00:02:08,192 --> 00:02:12,154
...son of the great swordsman
Antonio Garibaldi DeMarco...

3
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,826
...tragically killed defending
the honor of my mother...

4
00:02:16,118 --> 00:02:19,871
the beautiful Dona Ines
Santiago y San Martine.

5
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:23,959
I am the world's greatest lover.

6
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:45,481
I have made love
to over a thousand women.

7
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,318
I was 21 last Tuesday.

8
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:57,494
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Nicholas.

9
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:05,002
No woman has ever
left my arms unsatisfied.

10
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:07,129
Only one has rejected me...

11
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,507
and as fortune would have it...

12
00:03:09,674 --> 00:03:12,927
she's the only one who
has ever mattered.

13
00:03:13,178 --> 00:03:14,387
This is why...

14
00:03:14,596 --> 00:03:15,764
at 21...

15
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:18,683
I have determined to end
my life.

16
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:20,894
But first...

17
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:24,022
one final conquest.

18
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:52,385
May I?

19
00:03:52,636 --> 00:03:53,887
Actually...

20
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:56,807
I'm expecting a friend.
He should be here soon.

21
00:03:58,225 --> 00:03:59,518
I will not linger.

22
00:04:02,146 --> 00:04:03,189
I am Don Juan.

23
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:07,485
That's very funny.

24
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:09,487
Is there
a costume party at the hotel?

25
00:04:09,737 --> 00:04:11,906
No, I am Don Juan...

26
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:15,159
directly descended from
the noble Spanish family.

27
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:17,870
And you seduce women.

28
00:04:18,162 --> 00:04:20,666
No, I never take advantage
of a woman.

29
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,293
I give women pleasure...

30
00:04:24,086 --> 00:04:25,295
if they desire it.

31
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:30,801
It is of coursethe greatest pleasure
they will ever experience.

32
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:39,519
There are some women...

33
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:42,105
fine-featured...

34
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:43,857
a certain...

35
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:46,025
texture to the hair,

36
00:04:46,276 --> 00:04:48,445
a curve to the ears, that ....

37
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:51,072
that sweeps like the turn
of a shell.

38
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:53,950
these women...

39
00:04:56,203 --> 00:04:57,705
have fingers...

40
00:04:58,414 --> 00:05:01,584
with the same sensitivities
as their legs.

41
00:05:02,376 --> 00:05:06,297
The fingertips have
the same feelings as their feet.

42
00:05:06,964 --> 00:05:09,216
When you touch their knuckles,

43
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:13,972
it is like passing your hands
along their knees...

44
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,433
and this...

45
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:20,145
tender, fleshy part
of their finger...

46
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,901
is the same as brushing your hands
around their thighs...

47
00:05:30,822 --> 00:05:31,783
and...

48
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,160
finally...

49
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:47,006
Every woman is a mystery
to be solved...

50
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,011
but a woman hides nothing
from a true lover.

51
00:05:51,762 --> 00:05:55,224
Her skin color can tell us
how to proceed.

52
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:59,937
A hue like the blush of a rose,
pink and pale...

53
00:06:00,187 --> 00:06:02,731
and she must be coaxed
to open her petals...

54
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:04,942
with a warmth like the sun.

55
00:06:05,442 --> 00:06:07,320
The pale and dappled skin

56
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:10,198
of the redhead
calls for the lust of a wave...

57
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:11,866
crashing to shore...

58
00:06:12,117 --> 00:06:14,285
so we may stir up what lies beneath...

59
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:17,789
and bring the foamy delight
of love to the surface.

60
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:19,165
Although there is...

61
00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:23,545
no metaphor truly describes
making love to a woman,

62
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:27,133
the closest is playing
a rare musical instrument.

63
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:28,968
I wonder:

64
00:06:29,218 --> 00:06:32,138
Does a Stradivarius violin feel...

65
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:34,807
the same rapture
as enraptured as the violinist...

66
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:38,686
when he coaxes a single,
perfect note from its heart?

67
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,085
Muchas gracias, senorita.

68
00:07:01,836 --> 00:07:05,506
Every true lover knows that
the moment of greatest satisfaction...

69
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:08,718
comes when ecstasy is long over...

70
00:07:09,093 --> 00:07:11,095
and he beholds before him...

71
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:14,474
the flowers which has blossomed
beneath his touch.

72
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:21,190
Sorry I'm late, it was unavoidable.

73
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,445
Hope you went ahead
without me.

74
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:36,498
Oh well.

75
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,458
Now I must die.

76
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,092
THE BEACHES OF
CANARY ISLANDS

77
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,220
Unmask the Mysteries.

78
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:16,832
- Hey.
- Evening, Jack.

79
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:18,500
How you doing, man?

80
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:22,337
You're putting on
a little weight here.

81
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:26,508
You know..., you and me been
going to the same bakery.

82
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:28,802
Sorry to do this to you, Jack.

83
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:32,265
but this is a job, that
only Super-shrink can handle.

84
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:36,769
He's a jumper to be
reckoned with, I'm telling you.

85
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,729
What's the costume?

86
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:40,606
He's Don Juan.

87
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:43,734
"He wishes to end his life...

88
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:46,946
gloriously".
He wants us...

89
00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:49,950
to send our finest swordsman...

90
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,953
to do battle with him,
preferably...

91
00:08:53,954 --> 00:08:56,248
"Don Francisco de Silva".

92
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,584
Did he actually say this?

93
00:08:59,668 --> 00:09:01,295
I was up there.

94
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:07,802
How do you get in this?

95
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,679
Over here.

96
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:18,897
You sure this is how
Freud started?

97
00:09:19,147 --> 00:09:21,566
What do I know?
I'm just a dumb cop.

98
00:09:21,816 --> 00:09:23,235
You're the shrink.

99
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:39,794
Where is
Don Francisco de Silva?

100
00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:41,671
I will fight none other.

101
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:43,256
Where is he?

102
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,675
Don Francisco de Silva...

103
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:49,596
Left for Mallorca...

104
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:53,433
on this weekend
but I am his uncle...

105
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:56,436
Don Octavio de Flores.

106
00:09:56,853 --> 00:10:00,691
This will not do. I must die
at the hands of Don Francisco.

107
00:10:00,942 --> 00:10:02,485
I am Don Juan DeMarco.

108
00:10:03,111 --> 00:10:05,571
You are the Don Juan?

109
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,698
This is correct.

110
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:11,869
Why, with so many successes,

111
00:10:12,203 --> 00:10:15,039
does the great Don Juan
wish to end his life?

112
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:17,918
Because there is nothing left
to live for.

113
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,047
Do you mean to say
there is nothing at all?

114
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,968
Not when...

115
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:27,719
my Dona Ana is everything.

116
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:31,223
Her name is Dona Ana.

117
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:35,228
Now you understand
why I must die.

118
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:40,650
I ask only that it be at the hands
of Don Francisco...

119
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:44,446
so it may be said I died in glory
from a worthy opponent.

120
00:10:44,737 --> 00:10:47,449
Don Juan, this young woman...

121
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:50,577
Dona Ana, must be very special.

122
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:53,914
I would like so much to hear
about her.

123
00:10:57,334 --> 00:11:01,255
Have you never met a woman
who inspires you to love...

124
00:11:02,131 --> 00:11:05,551
until your every sense
is filled with her?

125
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,845
You inhale her...

126
00:11:08,512 --> 00:11:09,765
you taste her...

127
00:11:10,932 --> 00:11:14,436
you see your unborn children
in her eyes...

128
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,147
and you know that your heart
has at last found a home.

129
00:11:19,024 --> 00:11:20,942
Your life begins with her...

130
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:25,447
and without her
it must surely end.

131
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:31,287
I have no doubt losing a love like this...

132
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:34,457
can be very painful, ....

133
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:37,710
but why lose hope
along with life?

134
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,669
Why lose everything?

135
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:42,298
You must not forget, my friend...

136
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:45,385
that the power of your love...

137
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:49,139
the power of the love of Don Juan
is eternal...

138
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:51,433
and will not be denied.

139
00:11:56,313 --> 00:11:57,815
I apologize...

140
00:11:58,565 --> 00:12:01,485
for this unmanly display,
Don Octavio.

141
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:11,079
Please.

142
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:14,749
I accept.

143
00:12:18,795 --> 00:12:20,088
Bravo.

144
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:22,424
Bravo.

145
00:12:41,236 --> 00:12:42,821
Good Morning, Doc!

146
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:52,664
White male, age 21,
brought in on a ten-day paper...

147
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:55,375
after suicidal gesture...

148
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:59,297
apparently precipitated by a...

149
00:12:59,881 --> 00:13:01,716
break-up of a relationship.

150
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,968
And the patient...

151
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:07,472
indicates no previous history
of suicides,

152
00:13:07,638 --> 00:13:10,266
no record of prior hospitalization.

153
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:15,189
There's no record of anything,
school, jail...

154
00:13:15,481 --> 00:13:17,399
mother, father, parents, nothing.

155
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,235
And this kid is...

156
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:22,529
"bizzako"...

157
00:13:23,322 --> 00:13:24,364
and is...

158
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:26,450
severely delusional....

159
00:13:27,242 --> 00:13:28,952
and believes he's somebody else.

160
00:13:29,244 --> 00:13:30,162
Anybody we know?

161
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,247
Name is Don Juan.

162
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,376
- I'm working nights again.

163
00:13:35,502 --> 00:13:36,669
All right, okay.

164
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,087
I'm not kidding.

165
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:41,132
Let's settle down and...

166
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:43,259
I'm always the bad boy.

167
00:13:45,261 --> 00:13:46,346
Who wants him?

168
00:13:52,228 --> 00:13:53,270
I do.

169
00:13:53,687 --> 00:13:55,523
- Wait.
- Don't be exasperated.

170
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,149
Wait a minute.

171
00:13:57,525 --> 00:13:58,818
Are you not retiring?

172
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,363
Of course I'm retiring, but I think
it make a hell of a swan song.

173
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,033
This sound like a long term case to me,
the way you described it.

174
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:08,829
I'm ganna give it to Bill.
Do you have the time?

175
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:19,297
Wait. Hold on one second.

176
00:14:19,464 --> 00:14:22,801
No offense. I'd like to
discuss this in some detail.

177
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:24,761
Can you talk about it later?

178
00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:26,973
- Is that alright?
- I look forward to it.

179
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,475
I want this kid.

180
00:14:30,393 --> 00:14:32,145
Be reasonable. Jack...

181
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:34,480
You're leaving in ten days.

182
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,149
So is the kid.

183
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,695
A delusional patient does not
get cured in a week and a half.

184
00:14:40,903 --> 00:14:43,991
The instant his 10-day paper
expires, he'll be committed...

185
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:45,909
Then we'll have to transfer
him to Bill anyway.

186
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,786
If this was a year ago...

187
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:51,665
and I said I'd get this kid out of here
in 10 days, there'd be no doubt.

188
00:14:51,832 --> 00:14:53,333
That's probably true.

189
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:55,752
So that's not the real reason
you're giving him to Bill.

190
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:03,678
You've been doing it by the numbers
for months now. You know it.

191
00:15:04,262 --> 00:15:05,555
You're burnt out.

192
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:07,515
That's why you asked
for early retirement.

193
00:15:07,765 --> 00:15:10,435
You don't need more time
to travel with Marilyn.

194
00:15:11,186 --> 00:15:13,313
Don't make my life harder for me
than it has to be.

195
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:16,816
How long have I known you?
For 25 years we've been going around like this?

196
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:20,404
Yes, and during that time you're the
best damn clinician this place has seen.

197
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:23,657
The best, everybody knows that.
But now it's time...

198
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:26,619
You know, it's time to get away.
Where are you going?

199
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:29,413
The pyramids? Oh, it's wonderful.
All that sand...

200
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:32,708
that sky, those vistas,
you'll have a wonderful time.

201
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,085
I wish you could see your face.

202
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:38,298
I'm giving him to Bill.

203
00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:42,886
This kid is gonna do

204
00:15:43,136 --> 00:15:47,140
a flamenco number on Bill's head
until it looks like a tortilla...

205
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,142
and it's gonna be on your watch.

206
00:15:58,903 --> 00:16:00,321
Would you...

207
00:16:00,571 --> 00:16:03,241
Would you like to talk about
why you attempted to kill yourself?

208
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:09,288
You want Don Juan DeMarco,
the world's greatest lover...

209
00:16:09,497 --> 00:16:11,040
to talk to you?

210
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,336
What do you know of great love?

211
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,342
Have you ever loved a woman...

212
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:23,428
until milk leaked from her

213
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:26,932
as though she had just
given birth to love itself...

214
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:29,476
and now must feed it or burst?

215
00:16:33,356 --> 00:16:35,608
Have you ever tasted a woman...

216
00:16:36,526 --> 00:16:39,696
until she believed that
she could be satisfied...

217
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:43,491
only by consuming the tongue
that had devoured her?

218
00:16:44,284 --> 00:16:47,787
Have you ever loved
a woman so completely...

219
00:16:48,622 --> 00:16:51,208
that the sound
of your voice in her ear...

220
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:53,461
could cause
her body to shudder

221
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:56,881
and explode with
such intense pleasure...

222
00:16:57,798 --> 00:17:00,801
that only weeping could
bring her full release?

223
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:06,056
Where is Don Octavio De Flores?

224
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:08,393
Who? Who?

225
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:10,228
My host at this villa.

226
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:13,190
Villa?

227
00:17:18,195 --> 00:17:19,654
Villa?

228
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:20,989
Si, villa.

229
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,664
Where is Don Octavio?

230
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,085
You mean Dr. Mickler?

231
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,046
Who?

232
00:17:39,175 --> 00:17:42,429
Why do you think that
Dr. Mickler is...

233
00:17:42,763 --> 00:17:45,265
Don Octavio de Flores?

234
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:48,936
Why do you think Don Octavio
de Flores is Dr. Mickler?

235
00:17:57,402 --> 00:17:58,904
Hello there, Willy.

236
00:17:59,863 --> 00:18:00,990
How are you?

237
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:03,034
- Don Octavio de Flores?

238
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:06,454
- I just said...
- You told him that you were
Don Octavio de Flores?

239
00:18:06,704 --> 00:18:07,580
Oh, Jesus.

240
00:18:07,872 --> 00:18:10,041
You told a delusional patient...

241
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,418
you were a 17th century
Spanish nobleman.

242
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,921
The idea
was to get him in the bucket, right?

243
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,092
Well, he's all yours, Don.

244
00:18:19,218 --> 00:18:21,887
Wait a minute,
did you tell Paul?

245
00:18:22,138 --> 00:18:23,722
You bet i did.

246
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:25,432
And what did he say?

247
00:18:26,392 --> 00:18:27,810
His exact words were,

248
00:18:28,144 --> 00:18:30,688
"Jack broke it,
let him fix it".

249
00:18:38,488 --> 00:18:41,283
This is very kind of you
to show me the way.

250
00:18:49,082 --> 00:18:49,958
Yeah, come on in.

251
00:18:51,168 --> 00:18:52,085
Dr. Mickler.....

252
00:18:52,335 --> 00:18:54,464
Dr. Mickler...., I've brought...

253
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,260
Mr. Juan here for his appointment.

254
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,179
Thank you, Gloria.

255
00:19:01,512 --> 00:19:03,973
I can return at the end
of the hour and see him back.

256
00:19:04,182 --> 00:19:06,976
- No, it's okay, I'll do it.
- It's really no trouble.

257
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:10,813
I'll be passing by this door
in exactly one hour.

258
00:19:11,022 --> 00:19:13,066
- Gloria. Thank you.
- I have a break coming up.

259
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:15,402
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem.

260
00:19:16,778 --> 00:19:19,156
What are you doing
to these girls?

261
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:21,658
Gosh almighty.

262
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:26,538
Your people took my mask,
Don Octavio.

263
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,083
They had no right to do that.

264
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,336
I never remove
my mask in public.

265
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:35,131
Do you understand
the consequences of this?

266
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:37,300
Not fully, but...

267
00:19:38,968 --> 00:19:40,637
Well, I will be cursed.

268
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:45,517
I can certainly understand
how that could be upsetting.

269
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:47,937
Think how you would feel...

270
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,438
if you were made to take off
this mask that you are wearing.

271
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,777
Our masks really
get us in Dutch, don't they?

272
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,112
How long you been wearing yours?

273
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,573
Since I was 16.

274
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,955
I placed the mask on my face

275
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,959
and vowed never to remove it,
on the day I left my mother,

276
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,920
the dark beauty, Dona Ines.

277
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:16,299
I have some pills here.
I'd like you

278
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,386
and I'd like you to take them,
I think they'll help.

279
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,263
Pills to stop delusions?

280
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:24,892
Then I am afraid we must take
these pills together...

281
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:26,227
because...

282
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,980
you are severely deluded.

283
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:33,734
What delusions have I got?

284
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:37,613
This fantasy that you are some...

285
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:39,323
Dr. Mickler.

286
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:42,995
I'm very disappointed in you,
Don Octavio.

287
00:20:43,203 --> 00:20:45,164
Very disappointed.

288
00:20:46,081 --> 00:20:47,666
Here's the drill.

289
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:51,336
They can make you take the medication.
That's State law.

290
00:20:52,713 --> 00:20:55,174
You're on what they call
a 10-day paper.

291
00:20:55,382 --> 00:20:57,634
For those 10 days
they can do...

292
00:20:57,926 --> 00:21:00,930
- whatever they think is appropriate.
- I am not deluded.

293
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,807
I am Don Juan.

294
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:07,896
If you will not medicate me
for these 10 days, I'll prove it to you.

295
00:21:08,146 --> 00:21:11,941
Alright. What if I don't believe
you're Don Juan?

296
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:21,452
Then I will take your medication...

297
00:21:22,745 --> 00:21:25,831
and you may commit me
for as long as you like.

298
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:30,127
Do we have an agreement?

299
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,965
Do I have these 10 days
to tell you my story?

300
00:21:41,473 --> 00:21:42,641
Very well.

301
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,227
I was born in Mexico.

302
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,546
It became evident from
a very early age...

303
00:22:11,046 --> 00:22:13,382
that there was something
different about me.

304
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:31,901
I, myself...

305
00:22:32,235 --> 00:22:33,987
slowly began to realize
that my play

306
00:22:34,237 --> 00:22:38,283
was not like that
of the other boys.

307
00:22:39,242 --> 00:22:43,163
By the time I was 10,
the attraction that females had for me

308
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:45,499
was becoming of some concern
to my mother.

309
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,835
She presented me to God...

310
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,255
and asked the Lord to save me
before it was too late.

311
00:22:52,006 --> 00:22:53,424
Apparently...

312
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:55,301
it was too late.

313
00:22:59,763 --> 00:23:04,186
The lessons I learned in church
were not without value, however.

314
00:23:05,103 --> 00:23:07,230
By the time I was 12,

315
00:23:07,439 --> 00:23:10,233
I understood the obligation
the Lord spoke of

316
00:23:10,442 --> 00:23:13,403
to share one's blessings
with those less fortunate.

317
00:23:27,877 --> 00:23:28,836
Vayanse ya de aqui!

318
00:23:29,086 --> 00:23:30,630
Se acabo lo bueno!

319
00:23:35,218 --> 00:23:36,302
One night...

320
00:23:36,552 --> 00:23:39,890
I watched Dona Querida
at the window in her slip.

321
00:23:40,808 --> 00:23:43,727
and noticed, for the first time
how a woman's underclothing...

322
00:23:43,977 --> 00:23:45,646
barely touches her skin...

323
00:23:46,188 --> 00:23:50,567
how it rides on
a cushion of air as she moves...

324
00:23:50,818 --> 00:23:54,071
how the silk floats about
her body, brushing her flesh...

325
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:56,323
like an angel's wings...

326
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:01,287
and I understood how a woman
must be touched.

327
00:24:03,748 --> 00:24:05,625
Are you Italian,

328
00:24:05,834 --> 00:24:08,127
Mexican or Spanish?

329
00:24:08,336 --> 00:24:11,130
That is all you have to say?
What is my nationality?

330
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:14,927
No. Your name is DeMarco.
That's Italian.

331
00:24:15,177 --> 00:24:19,640
You were brought up in Mexico
and whwn you speak English,

332
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:22,059
you speak it
with a Castilian accent.

333
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:27,064
My accent has been colored
by my many travels.

334
00:24:28,941 --> 00:24:32,153
Very well, I will answer your question.
I was raised in Mexico.

335
00:24:32,696 --> 00:24:35,031
My father was born in Queens.

336
00:24:35,282 --> 00:24:39,035
His name was Tony DeMarco.
He was Italian. The Dance King of Astoria.

337
00:24:39,286 --> 00:24:40,245
Excuse me.

338
00:24:40,453 --> 00:24:42,873
Your father was a dance king...

339
00:24:43,123 --> 00:24:45,667
here in New York City,
in Astoria?

340
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:46,960
Si

341
00:24:49,212 --> 00:24:52,800
My father had come to Mexico to work
for a pharmaceutical company.

342
00:24:53,134 --> 00:24:55,595
He had just gotten off the bus
and was walking...

343
00:24:55,803 --> 00:24:58,764
to a nearby hacienda
to inquire about renting a room...

344
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:00,850
when he first saw my mother.

345
00:25:01,476 --> 00:25:04,103
Both her parents were killed
by a sickness.

346
00:25:04,312 --> 00:25:05,771
My mother was younger and stronger.

347
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,276
and survived.
She took over their plantation.

348
00:25:10,652 --> 00:25:11,945
Sitting in the sunlight
on the veranda...

349
00:25:13,489 --> 00:25:17,326
the bright rays lighting her hair,
she was a vision so beautiful...

350
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,164
that, at first, my father
could not believe his eyes.

351
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:25,125
It was love at first sight.

352
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:05,585
They held each other in
the moonlight, kissing and touching

353
00:26:05,794 --> 00:26:07,212
dancing until morning.

354
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:11,132
I thought you said that your mother
was standing in the sunlight.

355
00:26:11,383 --> 00:26:14,261
That's my father's story.
My mother says it was at night.

356
00:26:18,723 --> 00:26:20,852
They were married
the next week.

357
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,396
My father took
the name Don Antonio...

358
00:26:23,646 --> 00:26:27,400
and became "el patron",
running the coffee plantation.

359
00:26:28,317 --> 00:26:31,362
Their love was like
a perfect prayer.

360
00:26:31,904 --> 00:26:34,073
Even God could not deny it.

361
00:26:34,323 --> 00:26:37,286
I was born exactly
nine months later.

362
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:42,040
So I said to him "Let me just
see if I understand this".

363
00:26:42,124 --> 00:26:46,211
"You have been exploring
our car for six days now...

364
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:48,839
"and you still have absolutely no idea
what's wrong with it..."

365
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:51,383
"why the radiator keeps
running out of fluid?"

366
00:26:52,134 --> 00:26:54,511
"So this means
we get the car back..."

367
00:26:54,136 --> 00:26:55,471
"just as broken as when
we brought it in..."

368
00:26:56,097 --> 00:26:59,851
"Except now you want us to pay
you $430 for the time it took you..."

369
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:02,479
"not to figure out what's wrong"

370
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:03,855
Know what he said to me?

371
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,776
"We can keep looking if you want,
Mrs. Mickler...

372
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:12,322
...but it's $65 an hour".

373
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:24,126
Well, I don't know, pay the guy.

374
00:27:24,627 --> 00:27:25,586
Pay it?

375
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:31,885
Where were you just now?

376
00:27:34,137 --> 00:27:35,430
Down in Mexico.

377
00:28:00,164 --> 00:28:02,500
- Jack, I was looking for you.
- A little springtime.

378
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:04,877
- Excuse me, Nurse.
- You're giving me tulips?

379
00:28:05,086 --> 00:28:06,338
- Grace, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

380
00:28:06,672 --> 00:28:09,007
- Jack, why are you giving me tulips?
- I want to talk to you about the kid.

381
00:28:09,258 --> 00:28:12,010
- What's the occasion for tulips?
- Listen, the hell of it.

382
00:28:12,344 --> 00:28:14,054
This kid is fantastico.

383
00:28:14,263 --> 00:28:16,390
I'm glad he's meeting
your expectations.

384
00:28:16,598 --> 00:28:19,393
- Jack, there's something I want to discuss.
- I know you do.

385
00:28:19,601 --> 00:28:23,063
- Let me tell you what he did this morning.
- Please, wait! Jack!

386
00:28:23,272 --> 00:28:26,067
When do you intend to start
Don Juan on medication?

387
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:27,569
He's been here 2 days.

388
00:28:28,444 --> 00:28:30,405
You do intend to
give him medication?

389
00:28:30,697 --> 00:28:31,781
Well, I don't know.

390
00:28:32,031 --> 00:28:34,117
Wait.
He's a delusional patient.

391
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:35,285
Meds?

392
00:28:35,952 --> 00:28:37,579
If I give him medication...

393
00:28:37,787 --> 00:28:39,747
I'll never get into this world...

394
00:28:39,956 --> 00:28:42,835
that he's in and it's a wonderful world.

395
00:28:44,628 --> 00:28:45,588
- No meds.
- Ok.

396
00:28:45,796 --> 00:28:46,881
- Temporarily.
- Thank you.

397
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:49,216
- If you do one thing for me.
- What's that?

398
00:28:49,466 --> 00:28:50,718
Well, right now...

399
00:28:52,219 --> 00:28:56,807
Don Juan is having a distracting
influence on the female staff up in his unit..

400
00:28:57,516 --> 00:28:58,934
I mean, officially, in his hacienda...

401
00:28:59,393 --> 00:29:00,729
there are more nurses
on Valium than patients.

402
00:29:01,229 --> 00:29:02,689
- Right.
- Could you do something about that?

403
00:29:02,898 --> 00:29:05,567
I took care of it, my dear man.
Don't worry about it.

404
00:29:06,651 --> 00:29:08,028
Hey, man,
it's time for your shrink.

405
00:29:08,987 --> 00:29:11,865
- Who are you?
- I'm your new nurse, Mr. Compton...

406
00:29:12,157 --> 00:29:14,201
but you can call me "Rocco",
Casanova.

407
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,078
I am not Casanova.

408
00:29:17,496 --> 00:29:18,664
I am Don Juan.

409
00:29:18,915 --> 00:29:20,500
Yeah, right. Come on, man.

410
00:29:38,268 --> 00:29:39,144
Come in.

411
00:29:40,687 --> 00:29:42,231
Doc, Don Juan.

412
00:29:42,523 --> 00:29:43,732
Hi, Rocco.

413
00:29:43,941 --> 00:29:45,150
Thank you.

414
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:49,321
Well, got a real treat
for you today.

415
00:29:50,364 --> 00:29:52,074
Here are her nipples...

416
00:29:52,282 --> 00:29:53,660
and here's her pubis.

417
00:29:54,869 --> 00:29:58,039
Her lover is kissing the contours
of her bottom...

418
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,292
just where it folds
onto her upper thighs.

419
00:30:09,884 --> 00:30:11,637
Why don't we move on
to something else?

420
00:30:12,221 --> 00:30:13,806
What do you have in mind,
Don Octavio?

421
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:15,850
Why don't we talk about...

422
00:30:16,225 --> 00:30:17,518
who I am?

423
00:30:17,726 --> 00:30:19,270
Yes, i know who you are.

424
00:30:19,562 --> 00:30:20,521
Who am I?

425
00:30:20,729 --> 00:30:24,233
You're Don Octavio de Flores
the uncle of Don Francisco de Silva.

426
00:30:25,818 --> 00:30:27,778
And where are we, here?

427
00:30:27,987 --> 00:30:31,158
I haven't seen a deed,
but assume the villa is yours.

428
00:30:31,741 --> 00:30:34,411
What would you say to someone

429
00:30:34,911 --> 00:30:38,832
that said to you this is a
psychiatric hospital and that

430
00:30:39,082 --> 00:30:40,750
you're a patient here

431
00:30:41,001 --> 00:30:43,461
and that I am your psychiatrist?

432
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,506
I would say that he has a rather
limited, uncreative way of looking

433
00:30:46,924 --> 00:30:48,176
at the situation.

434
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:53,014
You want to know if I understand
that this is a mental hospital.

435
00:30:53,264 --> 00:30:55,016
Yes, i understand that.

436
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,811
But then how can I say
that you are Don Octavio...

437
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,397
and I am a guest
at your villa, correct?

438
00:31:02,523 --> 00:31:05,402
By seeing beyond
what is visible to the eye.

439
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:10,407
Now, there are those, of course, who
do not share my perceptions, it's true.

440
00:31:10,699 --> 00:31:12,743
When I say
that all my women are..

441
00:31:12,951 --> 00:31:16,121
dazzling beauties,
they object.

442
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:19,458
The nose of this one is too large...

443
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:23,588
The hips of another, are too wide,
perhaps the breasts...

444
00:31:23,796 --> 00:31:25,590
of a third, they are too small.

445
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:29,052
But I see these women
for how they truly are:

446
00:31:29,969 --> 00:31:31,054
Glorious...

447
00:31:31,387 --> 00:31:33,264
radiant, spectacular...

448
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:38,102
and perfect because
I am not limited by my eyesight.

449
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:42,024
Women react to me the way
that they do, Don Octavio...

450
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:46,654
because they sense that I search out
the beauty that dwells within them

451
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,657
until it overwhelms
everything else.

452
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,827
And then, they cannot avoid
their desire...

453
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,539
to release that beauty
and envelop me in it.

454
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,625
To answer your question...

455
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,878
I see as clear as day that this...

456
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,172
that this great edifice
in which we find ourselves...

457
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:07,133
is your villa,
it is your home...

458
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:11,012
and as far for you,
Don Octavio de Flores,

459
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,974
you are a great lover
like myself...

460
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,186
even though you may
have lost your way...

461
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:19,355
and your accent.

462
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,191
Shall I continue?

463
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:25,862
Very well.

464
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,613
Back to Mexico.

465
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:32,160
My mother, God bless her,

466
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:34,204
does not give up easily.

467
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:36,582
When i was 16,

468
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:40,210
she made one last attempt
to instill Christian values in me...

469
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,379
by finding me a tutor.

470
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:46,675
My mother's judgement
left something to be desired.

471
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:50,554
Dona Julia was 23 and married,

472
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:54,517
the faithful and devoted wife
of Don Alfonso...

473
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:56,394
a man of 50.

474
00:32:57,312 --> 00:33:00,732
It was no secret that Dona Julia,
would have been much better served by...

475
00:33:00,982 --> 00:33:03,067
two men of 25.

476
00:33:03,234 --> 00:33:06,863
"Glorify God in your body
and your spirit...

477
00:33:08,406 --> 00:33:10,618
which are God's"

478
00:33:14,497 --> 00:33:17,500
My feelings consumed me
day and night.

479
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,251
I felt within me...

480
00:33:19,502 --> 00:33:20,920
a torment...

481
00:33:21,253 --> 00:33:23,839
a burning wound...
a yearning...

482
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:27,385
combined with the most
indescribable bliss...

483
00:33:28,178 --> 00:33:29,804
but what was it?

484
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:32,432
And you had no idea what it was?

485
00:33:32,682 --> 00:33:34,893
Well, I had an idea, but...

486
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,104
nothing definite.

487
00:33:39,189 --> 00:33:40,398
My father,

488
00:33:40,607 --> 00:33:43,527
understanding that manhood
was nearly upon me,

489
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,531
began to teach me how
to use my sword.

490
00:33:46,864 --> 00:33:50,576
So a lot of sword fighting
went on when you were growing up?

491
00:33:50,785 --> 00:33:55,373
It was a small and isolated town
that resisted modern technology.

492
00:33:56,374 --> 00:33:57,500
Advance.

493
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:58,960
Lunge.

494
00:34:13,392 --> 00:34:15,394
I notice that the smile...

495
00:34:15,644 --> 00:34:17,563
on Dona Julia's face was gone.

496
00:34:18,313 --> 00:34:22,151
It had been replaced by a sadness
even sweeter than the smile.

497
00:34:22,402 --> 00:34:25,530
I sensed that Dona Julia was
having a struggle within her....

498
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,951
and my own situation was becoming
no less difficult.

499
00:34:33,163 --> 00:34:35,373
I could only think of
Dona Julia.

500
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:39,086
To keep myself from going mad...

501
00:34:39,336 --> 00:34:41,630
I turned into a metaphysician.

502
00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:45,593
I considered the meaning
of the truth...

503
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,553
of being...

504
00:34:48,095 --> 00:34:49,471
and God.

505
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:54,935
I thought of the timetable
for the sun's demise...

506
00:34:55,936 --> 00:34:59,441
and then I thought
of Dona Julia's eyes.

507
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:25,051
I never will consent.

508
00:35:28,554 --> 00:35:30,264
I never will consent.

509
00:35:32,142 --> 00:35:33,810
I never will consent.

510
00:35:34,978 --> 00:35:37,105
But somehow,
she consented.

511
00:35:37,314 --> 00:35:38,482
She did.

512
00:35:56,584 --> 00:35:59,796
Then suddenly i was hit
with a revelation:

513
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:02,048
The way a woman's body is made,

514
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,133
the way a man's body responds to it,

515
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,719
the fire burning in my loins,

516
00:36:07,847 --> 00:36:10,683
the intense desire
to merge as one...

517
00:36:11,183 --> 00:36:12,434
it all came together...

518
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,272
in one brilliant flash.

519
00:36:38,044 --> 00:36:42,007
There are only four questions
of value in life, Don Octavio.

520
00:36:43,718 --> 00:36:45,219
What is sacred?

521
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,264
Of what is the spirit made?

522
00:36:49,557 --> 00:36:51,392
What is worth living for?

523
00:36:52,268 --> 00:36:54,103
And what is worth dying for?

524
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,482
The answer to each is the same.

525
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:01,486
Only love.

526
00:37:06,074 --> 00:37:07,409
Dona Julia...

527
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:09,661
was my first love.

528
00:37:13,582 --> 00:37:14,583
Well,

529
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:18,712
I see our time is up.

530
00:37:21,966 --> 00:37:23,384
The mask?

531
00:37:28,014 --> 00:37:30,517
Obsessive compulsive disorder...

532
00:37:31,017 --> 00:37:33,228
with eroto-manic features.

533
00:37:35,271 --> 00:37:36,314
Confirm...

534
00:37:37,191 --> 00:37:39,109
delusional disorder.

535
00:37:42,613 --> 00:37:44,156
Confirm depression with...

536
00:37:44,406 --> 00:37:46,492
obsessional features.

537
00:38:09,683 --> 00:38:12,310
Possible hysterical personality.

538
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:42,426
I take it you want to go upstairs.

539
00:38:43,177 --> 00:38:44,845
What gave you that idea?

540
00:38:47,514 --> 00:38:49,601
Why are you listening
to opera?

541
00:38:50,101 --> 00:38:51,352
You hate opera.

542
00:38:51,603 --> 00:38:52,896
You have very...

543
00:38:53,229 --> 00:38:55,190
very beautiful eyes.

544
00:38:56,608 --> 00:38:57,525
Come here.

545
00:38:59,986 --> 00:39:02,697
You know, I have to go upstairs and...

546
00:39:03,531 --> 00:39:06,952
take my calcium so my bones don't
break into little pieces...

547
00:39:07,203 --> 00:39:09,914
my aspirin, so my heart
doesn't clog up...

548
00:39:10,122 --> 00:39:13,334
my Metamucil, so I don't get
colon cancer...

549
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:16,712
and, of course, my estrogen
to convince my body...

550
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,797
that I'm still 23.

551
00:39:21,634 --> 00:39:22,676
Come here.

552
00:39:51,624 --> 00:39:53,543
What the hell are you doing in there?

553
00:40:16,775 --> 00:40:17,944
Rain check?

554
00:40:20,947 --> 00:40:22,031
No, no.

555
00:40:22,282 --> 00:40:24,826
I was thinking about
our adolescence.

556
00:40:24,993 --> 00:40:26,828
There isn't any

557
00:40:27,203 --> 00:40:30,498
transitional battleground left
for us anymore.

558
00:40:30,874 --> 00:40:34,419
I just feel as thought
we've surrendered our lives to

559
00:40:35,296 --> 00:40:38,257
the momentum of mediocrity.

560
00:40:39,592 --> 00:40:42,678
What happened
to all the celestial fire...

561
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:44,889
that used to light our way?

562
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:47,308
Oh, Jack, no. Listen, honey.

563
00:40:47,933 --> 00:40:51,187
You know all those fires
are a lot of trouble.

564
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:55,525
They caused a lot of trouble,
are hard to control, they flare up

565
00:40:55,734 --> 00:40:57,944
they burn a lot of energy...

566
00:40:58,904 --> 00:41:00,572
and then they suddenly die.

567
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:03,617
I want to tell you something.
That's bullshit because...

568
00:41:03,825 --> 00:41:05,911
No, it's not bullshit.

569
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:09,164
A good, steady, warm, glow...

570
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,753
you know, that does the trick
over the long run.

571
00:41:14,337 --> 00:41:15,755
No fire...

572
00:41:16,005 --> 00:41:17,131
No heat.

573
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,467
No heat, No life.

574
00:41:19,759 --> 00:41:22,553
- That's the equation.
- No, no Jack.

575
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:26,933
May I assume that...

576
00:41:27,183 --> 00:41:31,188
the upshot of all this is that you will not
be easing gracefully into retirement?

577
00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:34,900
Goddamn right, baby.
What am I going to retire from?

578
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:36,151
Life?

579
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,612
Listen. We haven't started yet.

580
00:41:38,153 --> 00:41:40,489
This is a 12-rounder,
and this is the third round...

581
00:41:41,073 --> 00:41:43,492
and you and I are going to go
out of here like Halley's comet.

582
00:41:46,078 --> 00:41:49,123
Listen to me. What is going on?

583
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:51,417
You've been funny lately.

584
00:41:53,336 --> 00:41:54,170
I don't know.

585
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:56,631
Come on, you gotta me, Jack.

586
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:59,842
It's no secret.
I don't know.

587
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:01,344
I've been feeling...

588
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,349
I've been treating this
kid lately.

589
00:42:05,558 --> 00:42:09,019
He thinks he's Don Juan
and he's got a costume.

590
00:42:09,645 --> 00:42:12,022
He's got a sword and a mask and...

591
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:14,233
And so who is he really?

592
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:18,279
I don't know.

593
00:42:19,488 --> 00:42:21,198
But he's...

594
00:42:22,534 --> 00:42:24,369
he's getting to me.

595
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:42,722
Goddamn. you're a great broad,
really.

596
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,603
I know.

597
00:42:49,645 --> 00:42:51,814
This is going to be a good one.

598
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:03,535
- Oh, Jesus, not there, honey.
- Wait, I'm sorry.

599
00:43:04,203 --> 00:43:06,580
Damn, What is that?
Your hair comb?

600
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:10,792
- I'm on my hair clasp. It's got teeth!
- I don't want to be injured here.

601
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:15,464
At every instant we fell into
each other's arms.

602
00:43:15,965 --> 00:43:18,760
Time stopped
for those four months.

603
00:43:19,135 --> 00:43:23,014
There was neither day or night,
just my love and hers.

604
00:43:23,973 --> 00:43:25,558
As for Don Alfonso...

605
00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:29,854
he spent so much time away handling
the details of his trading business,

606
00:43:30,063 --> 00:43:33,776
that I was practically able
to live in Dona Julia's house.

607
00:43:34,068 --> 00:43:37,613
I truly believed I had found
everlasting paradise...

608
00:43:37,821 --> 00:43:39,532
until one night...

609
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,908
Dona Julia...

610
00:43:41,158 --> 00:43:43,160
my sweet bird!

611
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:50,167
Where is he?

612
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:53,755
- Where have you hidden him?
- For God sakes, Don Alfonso...

613
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,674
What sort of drunken fit
has seized you?

614
00:43:56,174 --> 00:43:58,385
How dare you suspect me!
Me, who the thought

615
00:43:58,593 --> 00:44:00,136
of infidelity would surely kill.

616
00:44:00,428 --> 00:44:01,638
Yes, search...

617
00:44:01,888 --> 00:44:04,641
and search and search.
Heap insult on insult.

618
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:08,061
You ungrateful, purgerous,
barbarous man.

619
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:10,523
Are you quite satisfied now?

620
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,359
I will kill this man.

621
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:16,863
My sword.

622
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:19,532
Where is my sword?

623
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,830
He's going to kill me.

624
00:44:27,624 --> 00:44:28,750
He's going to kill me.

625
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:34,715
Quick. Go out the garden gate.

626
00:44:46,644 --> 00:44:48,313
I will kill you!

627
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:01,367
It was the last I was ever to see
of my tutor...

628
00:45:02,368 --> 00:45:04,371
the lovely Dona Julia.

629
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:10,461
In great remorse, she left that night
and was never to be heard of again.

630
00:45:12,004 --> 00:45:14,048
Don Alfonso
was humiliated

631
00:45:14,298 --> 00:45:16,967
that he had been cuckolded
by a 16-year old boy...

632
00:45:17,218 --> 00:45:20,554
so to retaliate,
he announced publicly...

633
00:45:20,764 --> 00:45:24,559
that he and my mother had been
having an affair for many years.

634
00:45:26,603 --> 00:45:29,648
It was, of course,
a bold-faced and terrible lie.

635
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:34,736
My father was quick
to defend my mother's virtue.

636
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:41,202
I have no doubt...

637
00:45:41,536 --> 00:45:43,663
my father would've prevailed...

638
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:45,831
were it not
for one fatal mistake.

639
00:45:48,793 --> 00:45:50,795
He looked up
at my mother's eyes...

640
00:45:51,963 --> 00:45:54,090
and it was too late.

641
00:46:03,642 --> 00:46:04,977
Antonio...

642
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:17,574
No, Juan!

643
00:46:18,157 --> 00:46:21,119
I will lose them both!

644
00:46:21,494 --> 00:46:23,162
You have killed my father.

645
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,706
Now you must kill me.

646
00:47:17,803 --> 00:47:19,096
Forgive me, father.

647
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:23,309
Of course i forgive you.

648
00:47:29,566 --> 00:47:30,859
You are my son.

649
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,225
And so it was that my father...

650
00:48:01,433 --> 00:48:04,144
the great swordsman
Don Antonio...

651
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,730
died in my mother's arms...

652
00:48:07,022 --> 00:48:09,817
as our tears fell upon him.

653
00:48:13,696 --> 00:48:17,408
That evening,
to hide my shame forever,

654
00:48:17,783 --> 00:48:20,203
I placed a mask
upon my face...

655
00:48:22,873 --> 00:48:26,209
and vowed never to remove it
in the presence of another.

656
00:48:35,802 --> 00:48:39,056
My father left me too soon.
Don Octavio.

657
00:48:40,725 --> 00:48:42,351
I never had the chance...

658
00:49:56,555 --> 00:49:57,806
Oh, great.

659
00:49:59,307 --> 00:50:01,393
- Are you Dr. Mickler?
- That's right.

660
00:50:01,643 --> 00:50:02,644
Sign here.

661
00:50:03,144 --> 00:50:05,480
Would you just hold that for a sec?

662
00:50:13,739 --> 00:50:14,865
Hello, dear.

663
00:50:26,336 --> 00:50:27,713
So, Jack,

664
00:50:28,422 --> 00:50:29,423
what's the occasion?

665
00:50:31,842 --> 00:50:33,135
Excuse me, madam.

666
00:50:33,927 --> 00:50:35,721
You're the occasion.

667
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:49,402
No, really. Are you sure...

668
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:50,862
there's no...

669
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,128
Beautiful.

670
00:51:07,463 --> 00:51:08,464
Excuse me, ma'am.

671
00:51:39,038 --> 00:51:40,998
Buenos dias, El capitan.

672
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:44,669
Where's Rocco?

673
00:51:46,921 --> 00:51:48,256
He has moved to Madrid.

674
00:51:48,589 --> 00:51:50,299
- Madrid?
- Si.

675
00:51:51,092 --> 00:51:52,385
- Spain?
- Si

676
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,392
Then he feels so guilty,
he feels so overcome with shame...

677
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,561
that he puts on this mask...

678
00:52:00,769 --> 00:52:02,646
and he vows never...

679
00:52:03,105 --> 00:52:06,191
to take his mask off again
as long as he lives.

680
00:52:06,441 --> 00:52:08,569
Now, is that
a perfect myth or not?

681
00:52:08,777 --> 00:52:11,781
It's wonderful.
It's a wonderful story.

682
00:52:12,031 --> 00:52:15,118
You know, Jack, this kid is remarkable.
You're right.

683
00:52:15,368 --> 00:52:16,744
You're right.
It's like a Greek myth.

684
00:52:17,036 --> 00:52:18,329
It's exactly like a Greek myth.

685
00:52:18,538 --> 00:52:20,540
The son becomes potent...

686
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:22,292
sexually active...

687
00:52:22,542 --> 00:52:26,421
Leads to the destruction of his father,
who he replaces. As, of course, he must...

688
00:52:26,629 --> 00:52:29,300
He must some day, to become a man
but the guilt...

689
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:33,512
of replacing the man who loves him
and gave him life is too great.

690
00:52:33,721 --> 00:52:37,975
It's enormous. So he must
hide it by wearing a mask.

691
00:52:38,642 --> 00:52:40,769
It's time to put the kid on meds, Jack.

692
00:52:42,479 --> 00:52:45,190
You want to drive this kid nuts?

693
00:52:45,649 --> 00:52:47,736
Fill him full of...

694
00:52:47,986 --> 00:52:50,447
anti-psychotic chemicals...

695
00:52:50,655 --> 00:52:53,575
and in 48 hours
you'll have a nut case

696
00:52:53,825 --> 00:52:57,037
you are not ever going to forget
for the rest of your life.

697
00:52:57,245 --> 00:53:01,416
Jack, he is a schizophrenic.
He is not Don Juan.

698
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:03,710
How do you know
he's not Don Juan?

699
00:53:03,919 --> 00:53:05,838
I've been with the kid. I know.

700
00:53:06,088 --> 00:53:09,467
Has he ever told you, Jack,
in any of his sessions...

701
00:53:09,606 --> 00:53:11,358
- I haven't...
- Has he mentioned it?

702
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,968
that he's been living
with his grandmother

703
00:53:11,177 --> 00:53:12,470
in Queens?
Has he ever told you?

704
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,599
....any details like that.

705
00:53:19,435 --> 00:53:21,812
I got a call about an hour ago
from the department.

706
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:24,775
Now, please, Jack...

707
00:53:25,525 --> 00:53:27,236
put the boy on medication.

708
00:53:28,111 --> 00:53:30,113
- Paul, you don't understand...
- Jack!

709
00:53:30,364 --> 00:53:31,531
Please!

710
00:53:31,782 --> 00:53:34,076
Take it easy. He is your patient.

711
00:53:34,284 --> 00:53:35,661
You got five days.

712
00:53:36,078 --> 00:53:38,455
You got five days.

713
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:41,751
I am pissed off at you.

714
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:45,255
And don't forget
we're barbecuing Saturday.

715
00:53:46,047 --> 00:53:47,548
Really pissed off.

716
00:54:01,313 --> 00:54:02,565
Mrs. DeMarco?

717
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:07,236
Yes. This is Dr. Mickler. Remember?
We spoke on the phone

718
00:54:07,486 --> 00:54:09,697
about your grandson.
I want to have a...

719
00:54:11,407 --> 00:54:14,577
Dona Ana.
she's all he talks about.

720
00:54:15,327 --> 00:54:17,706
He waits for the mailman every day
like he's delivering cannoli.

721
00:54:19,249 --> 00:54:23,211
The boy's convinced
he's found his one true love.

722
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,340
He's worse than his father,

723
00:54:27,674 --> 00:54:28,758
Tony

724
00:54:29,509 --> 00:54:30,468
Tony,

725
00:54:30,677 --> 00:54:33,472
the Dance King of Astoria.

726
00:54:35,766 --> 00:54:37,560
This is his father?

727
00:54:39,687 --> 00:54:41,564
He won a prize for dancing?

728
00:54:41,856 --> 00:54:43,566
You never heard of him?

729
00:54:45,526 --> 00:54:48,279
Did his father sell pharmaceuticals?

730
00:54:50,448 --> 00:54:54,036
Tony couldn't sell a boat
to a drowning man.

731
00:54:54,286 --> 00:54:56,955
He worked
for a dry cleaning concern.

732
00:54:57,372 --> 00:55:00,208
He did drapes and sofas.

733
00:55:00,459 --> 00:55:02,461
Is his father still alive?

734
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:07,049
Didn't Johnny tell you anything?

735
00:55:07,299 --> 00:55:08,717
Tony died...

736
00:55:09,051 --> 00:55:11,596
in a terrible car crash.

737
00:55:11,888 --> 00:55:13,264
It was five years ago.

738
00:55:13,473 --> 00:55:14,557
In Mexico.

739
00:55:14,807 --> 00:55:16,517
In Phoenix.

740
00:55:18,728 --> 00:55:20,230
They never lived in Mexico?

741
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,356
Never.

742
00:55:21,564 --> 00:55:24,400
- Where is his mother?
- I couldn't tell you.

743
00:55:25,068 --> 00:55:27,780
We were never what
you might call close.

744
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:33,118
Mrs. DeMarco, How often did
you see your grandson...

745
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:35,246
when he was growing up?

746
00:55:35,746 --> 00:55:37,331
Only once.

747
00:55:37,665 --> 00:55:39,375
Johnny was six.

748
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:42,002
Do you mean that
that's the only time...

749
00:55:42,253 --> 00:55:45,006
you saw Johnny
in your entire life?

750
00:55:45,257 --> 00:55:47,842
Until three months ago.

751
00:55:50,262 --> 00:55:51,513
I open the door...

752
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:54,808
and there was Zorro.

753
00:55:55,433 --> 00:55:56,935
Chelsea Stoker.

754
00:55:57,352 --> 00:56:00,564
I just seen your grandmother and
she's got the bizarre impression

755
00:56:00,772 --> 00:56:04,110
that your name is
John Arnold DeMarco...

756
00:56:04,443 --> 00:56:06,862
that you grew up
in Phoenix, Arizona...

757
00:56:07,196 --> 00:56:09,657
and that your father
died in a car crash.

758
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,952
Interesting fantasy.

759
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,581
But I suppose
if it makes her happy...

760
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,874
it is harmless enough.

761
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:21,753
She told me your father
worked in....

762
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:24,172
a dry cleaning establishment.

763
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:28,885
You want me to tell you some story like my
grandmother's so you will think I am sane.

764
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:32,764
If that is what it takes to get out of
this place. I will be happy to do it.

765
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:36,810
But there is a rumor that you are
supposed to be a psychiatrist.

766
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,480
I've heard that rumor, too.

767
00:56:39,898 --> 00:56:42,775
Can you not tell when you meet
a woman who's completely insane?

768
00:56:42,984 --> 00:56:46,738
Are you saying that your grandmother
made this all up?

769
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:48,907
In so many words, yes.

770
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:51,117
She hated my mother.

771
00:56:51,326 --> 00:56:54,704
It's not unusual because my
grandmother hated everybody.

772
00:56:55,246 --> 00:56:58,083
So we stayed as far away from her
as possible.

773
00:56:58,751 --> 00:57:01,670
- In Phoenix, Arizona.
- In Mexico.

774
00:57:02,087 --> 00:57:04,590
You mean you never lived
in Phoenix, Arizona?

775
00:57:05,007 --> 00:57:07,176
No, I never lived
in Phoenix, Arizona.

776
00:57:07,593 --> 00:57:09,595
What about
your father's death?

777
00:57:09,845 --> 00:57:12,890
I have told you how my father died,
Don Octavio.

778
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:21,233
Her name is Chel--
I'm not going to take it away.

779
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:24,653
I just want to point out
her name is Chelsea Stoker.

780
00:57:24,861 --> 00:57:27,155
They never use
their real names.

781
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:29,824
She is really my Dona Ana.

782
00:57:32,787 --> 00:57:34,664
She is trying to teach me a lesson.

783
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,416
You know, I...

784
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:42,004
I once treated a young man,
about your age...

785
00:57:44,131 --> 00:57:48,594
and he fell in love oddly enough,
with a girl on a poster.

786
00:57:49,638 --> 00:57:51,974
He was very insecure about women...

787
00:57:53,016 --> 00:57:54,393
And..

788
00:57:55,477 --> 00:57:57,646
and he tried
to contact her.

789
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:59,731
He must have called...

790
00:57:59,982 --> 00:58:01,858
the magazine 100 times...

791
00:58:02,651 --> 00:58:04,820
till finally somebody
at the magazine...

792
00:58:05,654 --> 00:58:08,199
took pity on him
and gave him her number.

793
00:58:08,658 --> 00:58:09,617
So he called her.

794
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,747
They had a one-minute conversation
and she let him know...

795
00:58:16,082 --> 00:58:18,793
she never wanted to speak
to him again.

796
00:58:23,506 --> 00:58:24,674
And then what happened?

797
00:58:24,924 --> 00:58:28,429
He tried to kill himself
is what happened.

798
00:58:33,183 --> 00:58:35,644
Dona Ana is real, Don Octavio.

799
00:58:38,689 --> 00:58:40,649
Want to hear about her?

800
00:58:41,275 --> 00:58:42,985
I suppose so.

801
00:58:45,864 --> 00:58:48,575
Shortly after
the death of my father...

802
00:58:48,783 --> 00:58:53,330
my mother decided that it would be
the best to send me to Cadiz...

803
00:58:53,538 --> 00:58:56,541
as though a voyage at sea
would purify me.

804
00:58:57,125 --> 00:59:00,462
She herself had determined
to take her vows...

805
00:59:00,712 --> 00:59:04,550
at the convent of Santa Maria,
where she is a nun to this day.

806
00:59:05,635 --> 00:59:07,553
I was being sent forth...

807
00:59:07,803 --> 00:59:09,889
Like a dove of promise.

808
00:59:11,223 --> 00:59:13,935
Of course, what my mother never
knew was that the ship...

809
00:59:14,143 --> 00:59:16,979
was run by scoundrels.

810
00:59:17,146 --> 00:59:19,066
Instead of Cadiz...

811
00:59:19,316 --> 00:59:20,817
they set sail...

812
00:59:21,151 --> 00:59:23,820
for an obscure
Arabian Sultanate,

813
00:59:24,071 --> 00:59:27,783
where the passengers were
immediately sold into slavery.

814
00:59:29,993 --> 00:59:31,703
You were sold
into slavery in a...

815
00:59:31,912 --> 00:59:35,249
- sultan's kingdom?
- That's correct.

816
00:59:35,582 --> 00:59:37,085
I was purchased...

817
00:59:37,335 --> 00:59:39,045
by one of four wives of a sultan

818
00:59:39,254 --> 00:59:41,256
and led off by her eunuch.

819
00:59:58,023 --> 01:00:01,694
I had no idea why I was made
to dress as a female.

820
01:00:02,111 --> 01:00:05,656
my mask had been replaced
by a mask of another sort...

821
01:00:05,864 --> 01:00:09,743
and so I supposed I was keeping
the vow I made to hide my face.

822
01:00:12,204 --> 01:00:13,873
The Sultan had a harem...

823
01:00:14,124 --> 01:00:16,418
of fifteen hundred young women...

824
01:00:17,043 --> 01:00:20,922
so the demands he placed on
his wives were relatively minor.

825
01:00:42,153 --> 01:00:44,697
I was presented to the Sultana.

826
01:00:45,072 --> 01:00:48,660
I still did not understand why
I was required to be in drag.

827
01:01:15,521 --> 01:01:16,981
You may rise.

828
01:01:19,692 --> 01:01:21,319
And you my go.

829
01:01:24,865 --> 01:01:26,408
You may stay.

830
01:01:31,288 --> 01:01:32,331
Slowly...

831
01:01:32,539 --> 01:01:34,416
I began to develop a theory...

832
01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:36,710
why I was brought
to the Sultana...

833
01:01:37,878 --> 01:01:39,880
But, i still loved Dona Julia.

834
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,844
I am sorry.

835
01:01:45,303 --> 01:01:46,471
I love another.

836
01:01:49,975 --> 01:01:50,934
Undress!

837
01:01:51,726 --> 01:01:53,520
Kill me if you must.

838
01:01:55,146 --> 01:01:58,525
I am prepared to die,
for I cannot go on living...

839
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:01,862
knowing that I defiled
the memory of the woman...

840
01:02:02,655 --> 01:02:05,700
who brought my manhood alive
and made it sing.

841
01:02:10,913 --> 01:02:12,081
It sings?

842
01:02:13,666 --> 01:02:15,793
I was prepared
to lose my life...

843
01:02:16,002 --> 01:02:18,213
rather than debase
my love.

844
01:02:18,672 --> 01:02:22,426
How could I be unfaithful
to my dear Dona Julia...

845
01:02:22,676 --> 01:02:25,804
who had nearly given up
her life to love me?

846
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:29,016
How could I sleep
with another woman...

847
01:02:29,266 --> 01:02:31,435
after giving
myself, body and soul...

848
01:02:31,685 --> 01:02:33,812
to sweet Dona Julia?

849
01:02:34,605 --> 01:02:37,900
How could I forsake
the purity of love...

850
01:02:38,109 --> 01:02:40,320
I had with my flower,

851
01:02:40,528 --> 01:02:42,030
Dona Julia?

852
01:02:44,449 --> 01:02:48,536
Actually, I was surprised at how
easy the past can be overcome.

853
01:02:52,624 --> 01:02:57,004
You know, my friend, until this afternoon
I have always believed that a man

854
01:02:57,212 --> 01:02:59,131
could love only one woman.

855
01:02:59,798 --> 01:03:03,510
I've been badly misled.
It's absolutely incredible...

856
01:03:03,719 --> 01:03:07,806
to me just a few hours ago Dona Julia
was the only woman who existed...

857
01:03:08,057 --> 01:03:09,141
and now...

858
01:03:09,391 --> 01:03:13,647
there is the magnificent
Sultana Gulbeyaz.

859
01:03:13,813 --> 01:03:15,899
- What a glorious body, breast...

860
01:03:16,149 --> 01:03:17,817
Will you please shut up?

861
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:21,988
Suddenly...

862
01:03:22,238 --> 01:03:25,158
I was truck by the danger
of my situation.

863
01:03:25,659 --> 01:03:28,453
I prayed they'd found
a place to hide me...

864
01:03:28,663 --> 01:03:30,414
where I wouldn't be discovered
by the sultan.

865
01:03:30,665 --> 01:03:32,250
As fortune would have it...

866
01:03:33,167 --> 01:03:36,337
their solution was a
brilliant one.

867
01:03:36,921 --> 01:03:39,048
It was God's canvas...

868
01:03:39,257 --> 01:03:41,717
in all its natural beauty.

869
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,977
For the next 2 years...

870
01:03:50,185 --> 01:03:52,771
my days were
spent with the Sultana

871
01:03:53,522 --> 01:03:54,690
And yours nights?

872
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:58,694
My nights were spent with the 1500
young women of the Sultan's harem.

873
01:04:05,785 --> 01:04:06,786
Come.

874
01:04:07,954 --> 01:04:10,623
Come to me, my little cockatoo.

875
01:04:13,793 --> 01:04:16,129
At the end of 2 years,
I noticed...

876
01:04:16,379 --> 01:04:19,591
I didn't have the same
enthusiasm as before.

877
01:04:25,472 --> 01:04:27,516
This could be a problem.

878
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:51,249
You may rise,
my little dove.

879
01:05:12,438 --> 01:05:13,522
Oh, well...

880
01:05:13,773 --> 01:05:16,276
all good things
must come to an end.

881
01:05:17,361 --> 01:05:18,570
Gulbeyaz,

882
01:05:18,779 --> 01:05:20,739
sensing the danger
to us both,

883
01:05:21,198 --> 01:05:23,784
arranged for me
to depart within the hour.

884
01:05:24,952 --> 01:05:27,829
I had learned to love
in 1000 ways,

885
01:05:28,372 --> 01:05:31,041
each one is a lesson
in the soul of a woman.

886
01:05:33,461 --> 01:05:36,047
I knew i would miss
every one of them.

887
01:05:36,965 --> 01:05:38,633
They'd stolen my spirit...

888
01:05:38,883 --> 01:05:42,553
and infused me with joy,
like a May day breaking.

889
01:05:47,308 --> 01:05:48,768
I would...

890
01:05:49,477 --> 01:05:52,064
I would like to hear this in
complete detail...

891
01:05:52,314 --> 01:05:55,234
but there's something that
i must do now...

892
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:59,363
so I wonder if we could
continue this tomorrow.

893
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:01,407
Of course.

894
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:04,285
Thank you.

895
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:06,954
Hasta manana.

896
01:06:17,424 --> 01:06:18,633
You're home early.

897
01:06:20,427 --> 01:06:24,306
How would you feel
about coming upstairs?

898
01:06:28,269 --> 01:06:29,270
Ok. Go!

899
01:06:32,356 --> 01:06:34,150
Ok. Wait a sec.

900
01:06:36,777 --> 01:06:37,987
Over here now.

901
01:06:41,866 --> 01:06:43,159
What happened?

902
01:06:43,618 --> 01:06:47,039
- You're no good at all.
- I am too good. I've got 3. Look.

903
01:06:47,289 --> 01:06:49,041
- I got three.
- Well...

904
01:06:49,291 --> 01:06:51,209
- When is my turn?
- I got five.

905
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:53,337
I know. You're better than me.

906
01:06:55,964 --> 01:06:57,966
- Did you get it?
- Yes!

907
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:20,281
Last but not least, the moment
we've all been waiting for....

908
01:07:20,491 --> 01:07:21,784
Don Juan DeMarco.

909
01:07:26,997 --> 01:07:30,125
In respect to that,
I want to say that...

910
01:07:31,335 --> 01:07:33,837
I've got a meeting with the kid...

911
01:07:34,171 --> 01:07:39,010
later on today and I think it might
very well be the definitive meeting.

912
01:07:40,095 --> 01:07:42,347
Jack, this isn't a treatment conference.

913
01:07:42,597 --> 01:07:44,391
This is a disposition conference.

914
01:07:44,599 --> 01:07:48,770
We have to know what to do with this kid
on Monday when his 10-day paper expires.

915
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,438
Do we ask the judge
to commit him?

916
01:07:50,689 --> 01:07:52,148
Do we let him go?

917
01:07:52,607 --> 01:07:53,692
What?

918
01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:01,075
I won't know until I have
the meeting with the kid.

919
01:08:01,284 --> 01:08:02,827
He's a suicidal patient.

920
01:08:03,035 --> 01:08:04,578
He's not suicidal.

921
01:08:04,787 --> 01:08:06,789
It was a call for help.

922
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,292
You're not suggesting
that we let him go, are you?

923
01:08:11,377 --> 01:08:13,170
- No, I'm not suggesting that.
- Alright.

924
01:08:13,379 --> 01:08:16,758
First thing Monday we have to get
the judge over here for a hearing.

925
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:19,928
Also on Monday we'll have to
transfer him to another therapist

926
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:22,306
because that's your last day, Jack.

927
01:08:22,764 --> 01:08:25,142
Bill?
You think you're up to it?

928
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:27,144
If he's on medication, I could.

929
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:31,649
He'll be on medication.

930
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:36,696
Alright. I'll give him...

931
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:40,950
I don't know., A hundred milligrams
of Mellzac, Q.I.D

932
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:44,454
And Bill can begin to decrease it

933
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:46,789
once his anxiety lessens about
being attacked...

934
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:50,294
- by his patients.
- Could you tell him to stop?

935
01:08:50,753 --> 01:08:52,046
And if he refuses?

936
01:08:52,254 --> 01:08:54,131
Do we restrain him
and give it by injection?

937
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:56,967
I'll get him to take the medication,
for Christ's sake.

938
01:08:57,176 --> 01:08:59,219
What's the big concern here?

939
01:08:59,595 --> 01:09:02,181
He hasn't been assaultive.
Anyway, I've got to go.

940
01:09:02,431 --> 01:09:05,100
No, no. There's one other
piece of business.

941
01:09:05,351 --> 01:09:07,227
Okay, we're ready.

942
01:09:08,438 --> 01:09:10,941
For he's
A jolly good fellow...

943
01:09:11,191 --> 01:09:13,610
For he's
A jolly good fellow...

944
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:17,864
For he's
A jolly good fellow...

945
01:09:18,281 --> 01:09:21,576
Which nobody can deny!

946
01:09:26,207 --> 01:09:29,877
"Today is the first day
of the rest of your life".

947
01:09:31,379 --> 01:09:32,213
Come in.

948
01:09:35,633 --> 01:09:37,301
I am Dona Ines,

949
01:09:37,551 --> 01:09:39,303
the mother of
Don Juan DeMarco..

950
01:09:39,971 --> 01:09:42,014
May I come in, Don Octavio?

951
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:45,978
Ah, Please.

952
01:09:59,658 --> 01:10:02,537
I came as soon as the
archdiocese de Mexico City

953
01:10:02,745 --> 01:10:05,415
told me that my son had called them.

954
01:10:05,581 --> 01:10:06,874
What exactly is wrong with him?

955
01:10:10,837 --> 01:10:13,881
I'm very grateful, Sister,
that you've come...

956
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:16,342
at this strange moment in time...

957
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:20,180
because there is so much
crucial information

958
01:10:20,431 --> 01:10:22,474
that I need in order to help
your son.

959
01:10:22,683 --> 01:10:23,892
How can I be of help?

960
01:10:24,351 --> 01:10:28,147
For instance, is it a fact
that your son grew up...

961
01:10:28,522 --> 01:10:31,775
with you and your husband
in Mexico in a small town?

962
01:10:32,026 --> 01:10:33,944
San Luis Coatzalcoalcos.

963
01:10:34,194 --> 01:10:37,324
It's not very far from "Izucar de Matamoros"..
Have you heard of it?

964
01:10:39,451 --> 01:10:41,286
Well, not many have.
It's very small

965
01:10:44,122 --> 01:10:48,543
You know, In order to help your son
I have to have some information.

966
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:51,296
I need to know about
Don Alfonso,

967
01:10:51,546 --> 01:10:54,675
about his father, Don Antonio,

968
01:10:55,885 --> 01:10:58,679
and about your relationship
with both of them.

969
01:10:58,971 --> 01:11:03,225
I think it would be best if you would
discuss these matters directly with my son.

970
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,979
My vows to God
do not allow me to talk...

971
01:11:07,313 --> 01:11:09,148
about certain aspects
of my past.

972
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:11,901
I don't think, Sister...

973
01:11:12,152 --> 01:11:14,279
I'm making myself clear.

974
01:11:14,446 --> 01:11:16,239
I've been to see

975
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:17,783
your son's grandmother.

976
01:11:19,493 --> 01:11:22,329
and she tells me that
neither you nor your son...

977
01:11:22,496 --> 01:11:24,122
have ever lived in Mexico.

978
01:11:25,916 --> 01:11:27,209
She said that you met Tony

979
01:11:27,459 --> 01:11:29,419
in Queens, New York,

980
01:11:30,088 --> 01:11:32,006
and until recently

981
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:36,094
she said she only saw her
grandson once in her life,

982
01:11:36,344 --> 01:11:38,137
when she was in Phoenix, Arizona.

983
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:42,016
She also said that 5 years ago...

984
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:45,937
that your husband died in a car crash.

985
01:11:46,604 --> 01:11:47,856
Now, in addition...

986
01:11:55,614 --> 01:11:56,699
I'm sorry,

987
01:11:57,533 --> 01:12:02,329
but you must understand, Sister,
that i need to know the truth.

988
01:12:03,455 --> 01:12:06,751
The truth is inside you,
Don Octavio.

989
01:12:07,627 --> 01:12:09,838
I cannot help you find that.

990
01:12:23,059 --> 01:12:26,272
Isn't she exactly
as I described her, Don Octavio?

991
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,443
Yeah.

992
01:12:31,569 --> 01:12:33,029
Exactly.

993
01:12:37,867 --> 01:12:40,828
Dona Julia has become
a nun at the same convent.

994
01:12:42,414 --> 01:12:43,790
So it seems.

995
01:12:45,417 --> 01:12:49,171
I told my mother could go back today,
but I'll miss her.

996
01:12:49,379 --> 01:12:52,674
She really has a way of putting
me in touch with what's real.

997
01:12:57,137 --> 01:12:59,265
Why are you so certain...

998
01:12:59,515 --> 01:13:02,852
that your mother was not having
an affair with Don Alfonso?

999
01:13:06,773 --> 01:13:09,734
My mother was not
having an affair.

1000
01:13:10,693 --> 01:13:14,864
Well, I think you can understand how
the thought might have occurred to me,

1001
01:13:15,406 --> 01:13:17,660
when you told me
how your father died.

1002
01:13:18,035 --> 01:13:20,955
It's never been clear
to me what...

1003
01:13:21,372 --> 01:13:25,334
what your mother meant when she
cried out: "I'll lose both of them!"

1004
01:13:25,542 --> 01:13:28,295
Did she mean
both her husband and her son?...

1005
01:13:28,963 --> 01:13:31,340
Or both of her lovers?

1006
01:13:37,472 --> 01:13:38,640
My mother...

1007
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:40,934
was not having an affair.

1008
01:13:41,977 --> 01:13:44,688
Do you understand why
it's necessary...

1009
01:13:44,896 --> 01:13:45,897
Stop!

1010
01:13:47,315 --> 01:13:51,820
You don't think I know what's going on
with you, Don Octavio? but I do. You need me...

1011
01:13:52,279 --> 01:13:55,157
for a transfusion because your
own blood has become dust

1012
01:13:55,366 --> 01:13:56,617
and clogged your heart.

1013
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,453
Your need for reality...

1014
01:13:59,662 --> 01:14:02,039
Your need for a world
where love is flawed...

1015
01:14:02,248 --> 01:14:05,418
will continue to choke your veins
until all the life is gone.

1016
01:14:07,169 --> 01:14:11,091
My perfect world is no less real
than yours, Don Octavio.

1017
01:14:11,341 --> 01:14:13,302
It is only in my world

1018
01:14:13,593 --> 01:14:15,095
that you can breathe.

1019
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,680
Isn't it?

1020
01:14:18,515 --> 01:14:19,558
Isn't it?

1021
01:14:21,435 --> 01:14:22,436
Yeah

1022
01:14:25,022 --> 01:14:26,815
You're right. My...

1023
01:14:27,399 --> 01:14:28,943
world is...

1024
01:14:31,029 --> 01:14:32,614
not perfect.

1025
01:14:45,877 --> 01:14:48,464
What is this thing
that happens with age?

1026
01:14:49,256 --> 01:14:51,800
Why does everyone
want to pervert love

1027
01:14:52,051 --> 01:14:54,678
and suck it bone-dry
of all its glory?

1028
01:14:55,888 --> 01:14:57,723
Why do you bother
to call it love anymore?

1029
01:15:03,854 --> 01:15:05,732
This will be our...

1030
01:15:06,983 --> 01:15:08,735
last session.

1031
01:15:09,819 --> 01:15:12,197
I'm retiring on Monday.

1032
01:15:22,124 --> 01:15:24,418
Then I'll tell you about Dona Ana.

1033
01:15:26,295 --> 01:15:28,631
and you will decide
if I should be set free.

1034
01:15:35,262 --> 01:15:36,931
On the second day,

1035
01:15:37,181 --> 01:15:39,225
after i left the Sultana,

1036
01:15:40,352 --> 01:15:42,604
our ship was caught
in a typhoon.

1037
01:15:44,272 --> 01:15:46,566
I alone survived.

1038
01:15:47,192 --> 01:15:49,528
After days drifting at sea,

1039
01:15:50,028 --> 01:15:52,572
I found myself
on the island of Eros.

1040
01:15:56,368 --> 01:15:58,037
She was 17...

1041
01:15:58,371 --> 01:16:00,248
and Nature's bride,

1042
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,875
fresh and fair,

1043
01:16:03,209 --> 01:16:06,504
and unacquainted with
the miracle of physical love.

1044
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:10,800
Her beauty was not made
of shapes and forms,

1045
01:16:11,134 --> 01:16:14,971
but shined from within,
like a star.

1046
01:16:27,151 --> 01:16:29,862
There are those who do not believe
that a single soul...

1047
01:16:29,987 --> 01:16:31,322
born in heaven...

1048
01:16:31,989 --> 01:16:34,534
can split into twin spirits
and shoot,

1049
01:16:34,826 --> 01:16:37,412
like falling stars to earth,

1050
01:16:38,496 --> 01:16:41,041
where over oceans
and continents

1051
01:16:41,249 --> 01:16:43,335
their magnetic forces
will finally

1052
01:16:43,543 --> 01:16:45,879
unite them back into one.

1053
01:16:46,171 --> 01:16:49,090
But how else to explain
love at first sight?

1054
01:16:50,675 --> 01:16:52,053
We were convinced

1055
01:16:52,303 --> 01:16:56,223
that there was no other life
beneath the sky but ours.

1056
01:16:56,932 --> 01:16:58,184
We believed...

1057
01:16:58,517 --> 01:17:00,603
that we would never die.

1058
01:17:02,521 --> 01:17:04,398
You must promise me

1059
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:07,443
that we'll be together
for all time,

1060
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:13,450
that we'll live here on this beach...

1061
01:17:13,867 --> 01:17:15,243
always...

1062
01:17:17,037 --> 01:17:20,207
and that should circumstance
ever separate us,

1063
01:17:22,542 --> 01:17:24,628
it is here we will come...

1064
01:17:25,796 --> 01:17:28,466
to wait all eternity...

1065
01:17:29,342 --> 01:17:31,386
for the other to return.

1066
01:17:36,224 --> 01:17:37,642
I love you.

1067
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:40,853
Promise me.

1068
01:17:42,313 --> 01:17:43,690
I promise.

1069
01:18:06,089 --> 01:18:07,215
One day,

1070
01:18:07,507 --> 01:18:09,092
I asked her to be mine.

1071
01:18:11,428 --> 01:18:13,179
I love you too much,

1072
01:18:16,099 --> 01:18:18,268
but i cannot love you any less.

1073
01:18:22,481 --> 01:18:25,568
It's of no great consequence, but...

1074
01:18:26,277 --> 01:18:29,864
will you be wearing your mask
throughout our lives together?

1075
01:18:33,868 --> 01:18:35,453
I have sworn to do so.

1076
01:18:36,871 --> 01:18:42,169
Then I ask only that you tell me
what led you to make such a vow.

1077
01:18:45,797 --> 01:18:49,134
I related the sad tale
of my Dona Julia...

1078
01:18:49,301 --> 01:18:51,053
never guessing for a moment...

1079
01:18:51,303 --> 01:18:54,514
that my sweet Dona Ana believed
I had saved myself for her...

1080
01:18:54,723 --> 01:18:56,351
as she had for me.

1081
01:19:01,397 --> 01:19:03,441
Very well, my love.

1082
01:19:06,152 --> 01:19:08,696
I will accept that I am not the first...
if you'll tell me,

1083
01:19:08,905 --> 01:19:10,948
with the same honesty,

1084
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:12,784
how many others

1085
01:19:13,994 --> 01:19:15,204
there have been.

1086
01:19:15,996 --> 01:19:20,459
This would have been a very good time
for me to lie, but truth...

1087
01:19:20,751 --> 01:19:22,920
is a terrible habit.

1088
01:19:25,422 --> 01:19:26,882
Including you,

1089
01:19:29,009 --> 01:19:30,427
there have been

1090
01:19:34,599 --> 01:19:35,976
exactly ...

1091
01:19:42,107 --> 01:19:43,274
one...

1092
01:19:44,609 --> 01:19:46,569
thousand five hundred and two.

1093
01:19:49,197 --> 01:19:50,533
I could see...

1094
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:53,452
that this was a sum
substantially greater...

1095
01:19:53,703 --> 01:19:55,913
that the one she had in mind,

1096
01:19:56,122 --> 01:19:58,624
and not easy for her to assimilate,

1097
01:19:58,791 --> 01:20:00,626
try as she might.

1098
01:20:02,086 --> 01:20:04,922
As her pain struck at my heart
like a dagger,

1099
01:20:05,214 --> 01:20:06,882
I begged to be forgiven.

1100
01:20:07,968 --> 01:20:09,219
I removed my mask

1101
01:20:09,428 --> 01:20:13,307
as a gesture of remorse
but my it was to no avail.

1102
01:20:13,557 --> 01:20:15,434
To hide her humiliation,

1103
01:20:15,684 --> 01:20:17,019
she took off the mask

1104
01:20:17,269 --> 01:20:19,396
and left me forever.

1105
01:20:20,981 --> 01:20:23,191
So my adventures came to an end,

1106
01:20:23,483 --> 01:20:26,988
and with them the chance that
one day, like my father,

1107
01:20:27,405 --> 01:20:31,326
I would die in the arms
of the woman I loved.

1108
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:45,257
Who am i?

1109
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:49,511
Sit down.

1110
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:55,684
You...

1111
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:57,978
are Don...

1112
01:20:58,604 --> 01:20:59,730
Juan...

1113
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:01,566
DeMarco,

1114
01:21:02,692 --> 01:21:04,819
the greatest lover
the world has ever known.

1115
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:10,283
And you, my friend,...

1116
01:21:11,284 --> 01:21:12,285
who are you?

1117
01:21:14,788 --> 01:21:16,122
Who am i?

1118
01:21:23,422 --> 01:21:26,050
I am Don Octavio de Flores,

1119
01:21:27,385 --> 01:21:29,470
married to the beautiful

1120
01:21:30,137 --> 01:21:31,806
Dona Lucita,

1121
01:21:32,473 --> 01:21:34,433
the light of my life.

1122
01:21:39,398 --> 01:21:41,358
And you, my friend...

1123
01:21:43,902 --> 01:21:47,114
you have seen through
all of my masks.

1124
01:21:53,829 --> 01:21:55,540
Here's your water, Doctor.

1125
01:21:55,873 --> 01:21:57,166
Thank you.

1126
01:22:09,512 --> 01:22:12,266
You said that you believed,
Don Octavio.

1127
01:22:14,435 --> 01:22:17,855
I believe that you are Don Juan,

1128
01:22:18,939 --> 01:22:21,108
but there are
a lot of people that don't.

1129
01:22:32,037 --> 01:22:33,913
Then I'll do as you ask,

1130
01:22:34,205 --> 01:22:35,623
my friend.

1131
01:22:57,855 --> 01:22:59,899
Vamos!

1132
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:21,755
You're retiring on Monday.

1133
01:23:22,005 --> 01:23:23,758
So, what are we going to do?

1134
01:23:23,925 --> 01:23:25,927
We're going to get airborne.
kid, I'll tell you that.

1135
01:23:26,094 --> 01:23:28,846
I'm trying to tell you something:
I like it here.

1136
01:23:29,097 --> 01:23:32,642
- I like my garden.
- We need to be a flight of eagles.

1137
01:23:37,021 --> 01:23:39,190
I don't see myself
in that picture.

1138
01:23:39,857 --> 01:23:42,611
What's the matter with you?
What are you talking about?

1139
01:23:42,861 --> 01:23:47,199
- I don't know.
- I need to find out who you are.

1140
01:23:48,283 --> 01:23:50,411
Jack, you know who I am.

1141
01:23:52,287 --> 01:23:55,749
Who's brought you coffee
for the last 32 years?

1142
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:59,671
Listen, I know a lot about dirty coffee
cups and I know a lot of facts,

1143
01:23:59,879 --> 01:24:02,841
but I need to know all
about you.

1144
01:24:07,303 --> 01:24:08,221
What do you wanna know?

1145
01:24:09,973 --> 01:24:11,349
I want to know...

1146
01:24:11,808 --> 01:24:13,685
What your hopes

1147
01:24:14,936 --> 01:24:16,771
and your dreams are

1148
01:24:17,148 --> 01:24:19,984
that got lost along the way

1149
01:24:20,192 --> 01:24:22,236
while I was thinking
about myself.

1150
01:24:24,739 --> 01:24:26,032
What's so funny?

1151
01:24:35,292 --> 01:24:37,377
Thought you'd never ask.

1152
01:24:44,593 --> 01:24:45,802
- Hey, Doc.
- Good morning.

1153
01:25:06,949 --> 01:25:09,077
Do you understand
why you're here, young man?

1154
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:13,957
Okay, then.

1155
01:25:14,124 --> 01:25:18,253
I'd like for you to tell me a little about
yourself, where you grew up?...

1156
01:25:18,629 --> 01:25:22,341
what made you want
to kill yourself? how you feel now?

1157
01:25:30,308 --> 01:25:31,476
I was born in...

1158
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:35,563
in Queens.

1159
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:39,067
Me and my parents

1160
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:42,237
moved to Phoenix
when I was a kid.

1161
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:44,698
I hated it.

1162
01:25:45,991 --> 01:25:47,410
When I was sixteen,

1163
01:25:48,244 --> 01:25:50,287
my father was killed in a...

1164
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:52,748
car accident just outside of town.

1165
01:25:53,749 --> 01:25:55,084
My mother...

1166
01:25:55,543 --> 01:25:58,921
she'd been having these affairs
and my father knew.

1167
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,553
Anyway, she felt so guilty,
she decided to become a nun.

1168
01:26:08,432 --> 01:26:12,352
So, within three weeks
of my father's death,

1169
01:26:13,186 --> 01:26:15,522
she was in a convent
somewhere in Mexico.

1170
01:26:17,107 --> 01:26:18,483
And there I was.

1171
01:26:23,531 --> 01:26:26,868
I had nowhere to go.
I didn't know what to do.

1172
01:26:33,875 --> 01:26:36,044
So, one day, I was...

1173
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,924
looking at this magazine,

1174
01:26:42,968 --> 01:26:44,553
and there was a centerfold,

1175
01:26:45,596 --> 01:26:47,973
And I knew she wouldn't
go for me,

1176
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:50,559
the way that I was,
you know, so I...

1177
01:26:52,144 --> 01:26:54,646
I'd been reading a book,

1178
01:26:54,897 --> 01:26:56,190
this book,

1179
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:58,610
and...

1180
01:27:00,737 --> 01:27:03,114
I decided to become Don Juan.

1181
01:27:04,949 --> 01:27:05,909
So,

1182
01:27:06,242 --> 01:27:07,994
I called up the magazine.

1183
01:27:08,411 --> 01:27:12,123
They wouldn't help me.
They wouldn't give me any information, so...

1184
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:16,587
So, I was about to give up and...

1185
01:27:16,837 --> 01:27:19,423
one day I reached this woman
who worked there.

1186
01:27:19,674 --> 01:27:21,509
I think she was a temp,

1187
01:27:21,759 --> 01:27:23,052
or something....

1188
01:27:25,096 --> 01:27:29,100
The woman took pity on me
and she gave me the girl's number.

1189
01:27:29,266 --> 01:27:30,518
So I called her up.

1190
01:27:31,352 --> 01:27:34,231
I said that we were
meant to be together and...

1191
01:27:35,190 --> 01:27:37,984
she called me a creep
and then she hung up.

1192
01:27:42,364 --> 01:27:45,033
I just decided
that my life was over, so I...

1193
01:27:45,283 --> 01:27:47,119
was going to kill myself.

1194
01:27:47,285 --> 01:27:50,414
Or at least I was going to make
people believe that I would kill myself

1195
01:27:50,706 --> 01:27:52,959
kill myself so I could get some
attention, or something.

1196
01:27:53,292 --> 01:27:55,712
I never really had any intention

1197
01:27:56,462 --> 01:27:57,880
of killing myself.

1198
01:28:03,136 --> 01:28:04,095
Thank you.

1199
01:28:04,387 --> 01:28:05,805
This has been very helpful.

1200
01:28:07,807 --> 01:28:09,560
Someone will show you
back to your room now.

1201
01:28:18,986 --> 01:28:19,903
Doctors,

1202
01:28:20,821 --> 01:28:23,866
this seems like
a perfectly normal kid to me.

1203
01:28:24,658 --> 01:28:26,118
I've had a couple of...

1204
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:28,913
centerfold fantasies myself...
and I'm certainly not going to...

1205
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:30,874
commit him to a mental institution
for his.

1206
01:28:31,166 --> 01:28:33,376
Your Honor,
I.... I think his behavior...

1207
01:28:33,585 --> 01:28:34,669
Let him go.

1208
01:28:35,712 --> 01:28:36,254
Thank you.

1209
01:28:36,921 --> 01:28:38,173
Thank you very much.

1210
01:28:38,423 --> 01:28:41,176
As his doctor,
I concur with your views.

1211
01:28:41,593 --> 01:28:42,635
I've spent more time
with him than you have!

1212
01:28:42,844 --> 01:28:46,307
I will call you later
and thank God for medication.

1213
01:28:46,766 --> 01:28:48,976
Have a wonderful vacation.

1214
01:28:52,396 --> 01:28:55,483
Bill, Nurse. As head of
the hospital, let me speak.

1215
01:28:58,444 --> 01:28:59,487
My name...

1216
01:28:59,695 --> 01:29:02,949
is Don Octavio de Flores.

1217
01:29:04,117 --> 01:29:07,621
I am the world's greatest
psychiatrist.

1218
01:29:08,705 --> 01:29:12,751
I have cured
over a thousand patients.

1219
01:29:12,959 --> 01:29:15,796
Their faces linger in my memory

1220
01:29:16,046 --> 01:29:17,839
like summer days.

1221
01:29:18,715 --> 01:29:22,011
But none more so than
Don Juan DeMarco.

1222
01:29:29,644 --> 01:29:32,855
So it was not so insane
that we all found ourselves...

1223
01:29:33,064 --> 01:29:36,901
on an airplane,
flying to the island of Eros.

1224
01:29:41,156 --> 01:29:42,449
It was like...

1225
01:29:42,658 --> 01:29:44,868
the Garden before the Fall.

1226
01:29:47,830 --> 01:29:49,540
Everything seemed possible.

1227
01:30:00,927 --> 01:30:03,722
How does our fable end?

1228
01:30:04,514 --> 01:30:05,890
His Dona Ana,

1229
01:30:06,099 --> 01:30:07,892
his centerfold,...

1230
01:30:08,518 --> 01:30:09,561
was she...

1231
01:30:09,769 --> 01:30:13,314
waiting all eternity on the beach
for him to return,

1232
01:30:13,524 --> 01:30:15,526
as they'd promised each other?

1233
01:30:17,528 --> 01:30:18,821
Why not?

1234
01:30:50,897 --> 01:30:53,399
Sadly, I must report...

1235
01:30:53,649 --> 01:30:56,194
that the last patient I ever treated,

1236
01:30:57,153 --> 01:30:58,404
the great lover,

1237
01:30:58,654 --> 01:31:00,323
Don Juan DeMarco,

1238
01:31:00,615 --> 01:31:02,784
suffered from a romanticism...

1239
01:31:03,159 --> 01:31:06,245
which was completely incurable.

1240
01:31:07,831 --> 01:31:09,249
And even worse...

1241
01:31:09,416 --> 01:31:10,668
highly

1242
01:31:10,918 --> 01:31:12,419
contagious.
