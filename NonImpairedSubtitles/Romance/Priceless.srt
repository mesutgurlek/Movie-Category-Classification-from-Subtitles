1
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,280
Excuse me...

2
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,960
Come here, honey.

3
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
So how did it go?

4
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,720
Very well. We went towards
the dam, and then...

5
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,680
How did it go?

6
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,480
Very well. We went towards the dam,
and then to the old town.

7
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,360
You don't like
the old town, do you?

8
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,960
So did you have fun
with your friends?

9
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,840
Did you have fun
with your friends?

10
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,480
And were you a good boy?

11
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,520
You were a good boy.

12
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,400
You were mommy's good boy.

13
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,840
So... how did it go?

14
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,960
Very well.
Impeccably.

15
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,320
We went towards the dam...

16
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,240
But did he feel good?

17
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,280
Excuse me?

18
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,800
Did he feel good?
Fulfilled?

19
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,400
He's somewhat of a loner.
He's anxious.

20
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He doesn't like the
company of other animals.

21
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,400
No...
It went impeccably.

22
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,600
He was with other dogs.

23
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,480
They ran.

24
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,040
And...

25
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,840
they talked to each other.

26
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,800
That's good.

27
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,120
Very good.
Wonderful.

28
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,080
Thank you.

29
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,320
Thank you, madam.

30
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,080
PRICELESS

31
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,880
Honey?

32
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,360
Honey?

33
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,600
Honey?

34
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,240
Jacques, I can't believe it.

35
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,800
Get up.

36
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,840
Come on.

37
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,600
Get on the bed.

38
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,120
Do you feel well?

39
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,680
Very well.

40
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,160
And you?

41
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,480
You're completely drunk.

42
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,160
It took you 3 hours to get ready.

43
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,600
Look how much you've drunk.

44
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
Don't worry.

45
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,200
These are little bottles.

46
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,880
You could have made an effort today.

47
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,160
Don't argue with me, honey.

48
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,120
I hate it when people
tell me the truth.

49
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,440
Right.

50
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,240
Don't move.

51
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,560
I'll give you a second pillow.

52
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,160
Thank you.

53
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,680
In 2 minutes I'll
be at your disposal.

54
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,600
Dammit.

55
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,280
Jean?

56
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,040
You look awful.

58
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,800
- Did you walk the dogs again?
- Yes.

59
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,400
And today morning
I took care of supplies.

60
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,080
Why do you accept this work?

61
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,320
They're so used to me accepting,
that I don't dare refuse.

62
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,080
Besides, I have the time.

63
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,720
Do as you like.
It's not my problem.

64
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,680
But don't fall asleep in the bar.

65
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Sure.
Of course.

66
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,720
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

67
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,960
I'm leaving now.

68
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,680
- Can you close up?
- Yes, of course.

69
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,000
He'll leave if
you turn down the lights.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Excuse me.

71
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
I'd like another one.

72
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,440
It's good you turned
down the lights.

73
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,520
It's nicer this way.

74
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,640
Thank you, sir.

75
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,120
Can you turn on the TV?
There's a live broadcast on Eurosport.

76
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,040
Yes, sir.

77
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,600
Sit down.

78
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,520
I'm not allowed to
leave the bar, sir.

79
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,360
Really?

80
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,560
Really. Except to serve drinks and...

81
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,520
in case of a fire.

82
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,520
Yes, sir.

83
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,760
Sit down.

84
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,240
Have a cigar.

85
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,400
Have a cigar.

86
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,880
The leaves grow in
the middle of cocoa fields.

87
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,880
That's what gives them
their particular aroma.

88
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,000
Do you smell it?

89
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,280
Yes, sir.

90
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,440
Because of the embargo against Cuba,
I fly them in by private jet.

91
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,600
One cigar costs about...

92
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,760
120 euros.

93
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,360
Good evening.

94
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,360
I'm sorry.

95
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,520
This is the first time
I've fallen asleep like this.

96
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,400
Considering the mood here,
I don't see anything better to do.

97
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,480
This place is dead.

98
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,800
No. It was brimming with life earlier.

99
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,480
But now it's a bit late.

100
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,080
It's not normal, that there isn't
anyone at the bar at this hour.

101
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,200
Normally, they aren't
allowed to leave before 3 a.m.

102
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,560
It's forbidden.

103
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,200
Unless there isn't anyone.

104
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,240
But you're here.

105
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,800
Yes.

106
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,840
And I'm here, right?

107
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,240
Indeed.

108
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,240
Something like this wouldn't
happen at the Carlton.

109
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,560
You know, the Carlton...

110
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,840
Do you think their
service has worsened as well?

111
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,400
Do you think he'll come back?

112
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,760
Who?

113
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,720
The barman.

114
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,240
I don't know.

115
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,040
Will you wait with me for him?

116
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,560
Yes.
Of course, miss.

117
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,000
That's nice of you.

118
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,600
Your cigar smells nice.

119
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,400
Normally I can't stand the smell,
but in this case...

120
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,400
Yes...

121
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
It's because of the leaves,

122
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,840
which grow in the
middle of cocoa fields.

123
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,440
Really?

124
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,040
They're flown in from Cuba
by private jet because of the...

125
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,760
Because of the embargo?

126
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,480
That's it.

127
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,880
Are you alright?

128
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,120
Today is my birthday.

129
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,280
Happy birthday, miss.

130
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,200
It's off to a bad start.

131
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,520
I wanted so much
to have fun tonight.

132
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,760
I'd give anything for
a cocktail and some music.

133
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,440
What are you doing?

134
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,480
Cocktails are my specialty.

135
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,200
Isn't this too risky?

136
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,280
In the worst case,
I'll just say I work here.

137
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,000
So what would you like?

138
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,200
I don't know.

139
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,480
Something that gives a feeling of joy.

140
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,560
For your birthday I suggest
something with champagne.

141
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,680
And that gets you drunk fast.

142
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,200
Gets you drunk fast...
Then...

143
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,160
A cocktail with champagne.

144
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,240
Excellent.
Wonderful.

145
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,240
I love to watch someone work.

146
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,680
I'm always impressed by
people who can do something.

147
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,720
I can't do anything.

148
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,480
Actually I can.

149
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,200
I can make conversation.

150
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,680
And you?

151
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,680
Right.

152
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,880
I'll have another one.

153
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,480
Which floor are you staying at?

154
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,400
Me?

155
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,760
Yes, you.

156
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,480
The fifth...

157
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,280
The fifth floor.

158
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,920
The imperial suite.

159
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,760
I only know the royal one.

160
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,000
- Will you give me a tour?
- Sure.

161
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,720
The dressing room.

162
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Here we have the living room.

163
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,720
The living room.

164
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,720
The first bathroom.

165
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,360
Here we have the study, with
a wireless internet connection.

166
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
And a fax.

167
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,400
The bedroom.

168
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,760
This way, please.

169
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,320
You must be very rich.

170
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,000
Why do you say that?

171
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,120
Must I do everything for you?

172
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,280
What?

173
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,840
Happy... birthday... to... you...

174
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,160
Happy... birthday... to... you...

175
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,960
Did they leave the royal suite?

176
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,920
They left this morning.

177
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,120
They stole a bathrobe.

178
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:08,680
ONE YEAR LATER...

179
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,960
The coffee, ladies and gentlemen.

180
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,280
Who'll be having the decaf?

181
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,920
Excuse me.

182
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,480
Excuse me.

183
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,400
Is everything alright?

184
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,280
Jean, but...

185
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,440
What are you doing?

186
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,520
Jean, are you alright?

187
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,640
Thank you very much, sir.

188
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,600
I'm not hungry.

189
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,920
What will you have?

190
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,120
What you picked.
Good idea.

191
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,520
With pleasure.

192
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,600
- Irene?
- Yes?

193
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,760
Happy birthday.

194
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,120
Thank you, Jacques.

195
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Are you alone?

196
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,280
For the moment.

197
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,960
And your...

198
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
uncle?

199
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,320
You're talking about my great-uncle?

200
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,600
He's growing old.

201
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,160
Will you have a cocktail?

202
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,040
Just one?

203
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,200
What the...

204
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,640
Older people get up early.

205
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,080
You should know that by now.

206
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,800
I couldn't sleep at all.

207
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,520
I went to the beach
to get some fresh air.

208
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,520
I also couldn't sleep.

209
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,960
And I saw you at the bar
with that guy.

210
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,480
You were tenderly getting
some fresh air on the sofa.

211
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,840
I'm sorry, Jacques.

212
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,800
I don't know what came over me.

213
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,360
That was the first time.
I swear.

214
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,000
In a few months I'll see
you at the same place

215
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,120
where I picked you up.

216
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,440
At the hotel bar,
wearing a mini,

217
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,800
with the same fake
expression of indifference.

218
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,480
I'm not worried.

219
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,000
You'll be so drunk
you'll ask me my name.

220
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,360
You'll offer me a drink.

221
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,240
Dammit.
I can't believe it.

222
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,360
I'm so stupid.

223
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,320
Dammit.

224
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,160
Dammit.

225
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,240
I left him.
I left it all for you.

226
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,640
Did you forget something?

227
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,880
I forgot you.

228
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,920
Excuse me?

229
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,600
But... weren't you supposed
to leave today?

230
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,920
Jean?

231
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,080
Yes?

232
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,440
I left him.

233
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,840
I left it all for you.

234
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,600
Really?

235
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,640
Yes.

236
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,040
Tell me I did the right thing.

237
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,800
You did the right thing.

238
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,720
I want to spend every
hour with you.

239
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,600
- Do you know what would make me happy?
- I don't.

240
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,920
A trip to the Maldives.

241
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:58,920
Where?

242
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,400
The Maldive Islands.
You don't know them?

243
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,360
I do.
But not all of them.

244
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,040
But first we'll order
a big breakfast.

245
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,880
When I'm happy
I'm also very hungry.

246
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,400
And this time we'll
spend the morning in bed.

247
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,040
You're not the type of person
who works all the time?

248
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,880
That depends.

249
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,920
Do something.

250
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,640
Damn, what are you doing here?
Everyone downstairs is looking for you.

251
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,960
Dammit.
I can't believe it.

252
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,560
Get out of here.

253
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,520
In 2 minutes I'm sending
Martine to clean the room.

254
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,680
Damn, I can't believe it.

255
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,080
I can't believe it's you.

256
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,000
You've arrived in Nice.

257
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,520
This is the last stop.

258
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,760
We ask all passengers to
get off the train.

259
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,680
We ask that you make sure you
haven't left anything on the train.

260
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,600
The next train will
arrive at 2 o'clock.

261
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,080
Henri?

262
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,160
It's Irene.

263
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,600
Irene Mercier.

264
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
We met at that social gathering.

265
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,320
At the casino in Cannes.

266
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,440
Last year.

267
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,400
I'm sorry.

268
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,960
Yes, of course.

269
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,240
Maybe some other time?

270
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,840
My number is...
Bye.

271
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,280
Asshole.

272
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,440
Dominique?

273
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,440
It's Irene.

274
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,080
We met at the VIP club last year.

275
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
You spilled your
glass on my dress.

276
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,160
Irene.
That's right.

277
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,200
Very well.

278
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,680
For how long?

279
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,760
Too bad.

280
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,720
Baire?

281
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,720
It's Irene.

282
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,440
Ivan?

283
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,360
It's Irene.

284
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,040
Single, small but well-proportioned.

285
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,800
Yes, Irene, that's right.

286
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,960
Benoit?

287
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,640
Asshole.

288
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,520
Philippe?

289
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,440
It's Irene.

290
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,320
Don't you remember the meeting
in Dauville last year?

291
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,560
I'm sorry.

292
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,280
My condolences.

293
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,840
Are you his son?

294
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,640
Grandson?

295
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,160
So we must be the same age.

296
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,840
What are you doing here?

297
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,280
Reception told me you asked for
the schedule of trains to Nice.

298
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,480
I'm going around from
one bar to the next.

299
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,000
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

300
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,680
Fine, alright.

301
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,600
Good bye.

302
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,280
I didn't get the chance this morning.

303
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,560
So I came by train.

304
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,760
No kidding?
You didn't fly in by jet?

305
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,720
I really wanted to say I'm sorry.

306
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,600
I wanted to say it to you.

307
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
I'm sorry for what I did.

308
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,280
Fine.
You've said it now.

309
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,480
So good bye.

310
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,640
I thought we could go
have dinner together.

311
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,280
Are you nuts?
I won't eat dinner with you.

312
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,440
I want you to go away.

313
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,000
I feel bad...

314
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,360
I don't care how you feel.

315
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,600
Do you understand? I don't care.
I have a date.

316
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,480
So good bye.

317
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,080
How about tomorrow?

318
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,360
Do you know who that
was back at the hotel?

319
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,160
We were going to get
married in 3 months.

320
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,240
3 months.

321
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,240
He adored me.
I even had an engagement ring.

322
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,560
I'd be done with the bars,
the mini and the smiles.

323
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,360
Do you understand?

324
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,040
I'd be set until the end of my life.

325
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,720
I'm sorry.

326
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,000
So am I.
You don't know how badly.

327
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,200
And now I have to start all over.

328
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,920
So if you want to do me a favor,

329
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,800
then just leave me alone.

330
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,080
You don't have the
time for a drink?

331
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,960
Dammit.

332
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,600
It's probably the second to your left.

333
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,200
You go out and it's
the second to your left.

334
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,240
Going out, the second to your left.

335
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,800
Going out.

336
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,240
François?

337
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,760
Yes.

338
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,440
- Irene?
- Yes.

339
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,200
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

340
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,320
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

341
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,440
I love Italian food,
because it's never pretentious.

342
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,960
And we never expect
anything out of the ordinary,

343
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,160
so we're never disappointed.

344
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,720
Right?

345
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,720
Indeed.

346
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,400
It depends.

347
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,160
But when in Italy, I don't like
to eat in the local restaurants.

348
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,000
It's less amusing.

349
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,600
Maybe because they don't make
the effort to act like Italians.

350
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,120
Maybe.

351
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,480
Listen...

352
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,320
That guy next to the
cars is watching us.

353
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,880
And I feel funny.

354
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,840
But I don't know him.

355
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,880
He was with you at
the bar when I arrived.

356
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,440
And now he's here and
I think he's waiting for us.

357
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,760
And I feel uneasy.

358
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:45,880
I'm sorry.

359
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,560
This is ridiculous, François.

360
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,400
You seem to love pasta,
so you can eat mine.

361
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,720
Can I leave you my number?

362
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,200
Is your invitation to
dinner still open?

363
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,960
Yes, of course.

364
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,200
I found a really nice pizza
shop in the old town.

365
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,600
No. I don't eat at nice pizza shops.

366
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,960
Alright.
As you wish.

367
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,720
120 EUROS
115 EUROS

368
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,240
230 EUROS
180 EUROS

369
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,840
I'd like some caviar.

370
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,880
The crawfish.

371
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,040
And some champagne.

372
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,080
And you?

373
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,120
What will you have?

374
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,280
I don't know.
I need to think it over.

375
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,160
Available at next delivery.

376
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,760
What?

377
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,920
The crawfish. It will be
available at next delivery.

378
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,720
The delivery has just arrived.

379
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,280
Good.

380
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,080
I feel relieved.

381
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,240
So?

382
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,040
I need to leave you for a moment.

383
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,000
Good evening, Mr. Molluquet.

384
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,240
This is a message from Mr. Simon.

385
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,200
Can you wire my bonus
to my current account?

386
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,840
My whole bonus.

387
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,760
Tomorrow morning.
I'd appreciate it.

388
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,200
I'll confirm it later in writing.

389
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,160
Thank you.

390
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,640
Good bye, Mr. Molluquet.

391
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,440
We'll order a second one.

392
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,960
It's sad with just one bottle.

393
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,400
It's boring.

394
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,640
I didn't want to lie
to you at the Biarritz.

395
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,200
I just didn't want to oppose you.

396
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,520
You seemed so happy.

397
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,200
And I was in heaven.

398
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,480
I don't really like caviar.

399
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,200
I force myself to eat it.

400
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,120
And with time I'll
start to like it.

401
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,840
I'm sure that when
I start to like it,

402
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,280
it will taste great.

403
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,720
It's nice here, isn't it?

404
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,760
I like this place a lot
because it's not pretentious.

405
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,720
It's calm and grand
at the same time.

406
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,320
We have the impression
that we're unique.

407
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,840
The handle is made from shark bone.

408
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,040
Amazing, isn't it?

409
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,920
The bones are dried for 2 years.

410
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,400
It takes one shark to
make one set of cutlery.

411
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,840
Here you go.

412
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,080
I'm bushed.

413
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
I want to go to bed.

414
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,480
At which hotel are you staying?

415
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,040
I found a small, very nice
hotel in the town's suburbs.

416
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,800
Very good.

417
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,200
So go get your stuff
and we'll meet back here.

418
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,720
Here?

419
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,640
It's more simple that way, right?

420
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,080
Yes.

421
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,560
- Is there a problem?
- No.

422
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,480
No. Not at all.

423
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,280
See you later.

424
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,520
Mr. Simon?

425
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,560
Yes, that's right.

426
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,400
Ms. Mercier is waiting
for you in room 304.

427
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,360
Thank you.

428
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,320
Did you enjoy your dinner?

429
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,600
Yes, very much.

430
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,320
May I ask for your credit card?

431
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,600
Excuse me?

432
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,480
Your credit card.
To cover the bill.

433
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,840
Right.
Of course.

434
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,480
Thank you.

435
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,320
Please take Mrs. Pontini's
baggage to her room.

436
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,200
- We're sorry.
- It's alright.

437
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,880
I have exactly the same.

438
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,360
They're the same color?

439
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,160
That's right.

440
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,960
Yes?

441
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,840
Mr. Molluquet.

442
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,480
How are you?

443
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,520
Excuse me?

444
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,240
No.

445
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,280
No one stole my card.

446
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,120
That much?

447
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,920
Please wire the money from my
PEL account to my current account.

448
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,560
And my PEP account?

449
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,440
And my PEA account?

450
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
Go ahead.
No problem.

451
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,640
Please do tell me.

452
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,880
Do I have the right to the CEL?

453
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,760
Well that too then.

454
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,960
How much money is in it?

455
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,960
I assumed there's more.

456
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,280
160 EUROS

457
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,200
Well?

458
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,520
Do you really want to go to town?

459
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,200
Yes.

460
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,840
Are you sure?

461
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,960
Yes, why do you ask?

462
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:23,920
620 EUROS

463
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,440
Why do you ask?

464
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,760
What do you think?

465
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,440
300 EUROS

466
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,920
What's wrong?

467
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,400
Nothing.

468
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,000
Good.

469
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,400
Can we go?

470
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,640
You can't continue doing this.

471
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,680
This is my business.
I'm paying, right?

472
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,520
Indeed.

473
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,680
And that's what counts, right?

474
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,600
Indeed.

475
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,440
So what's wrong?

476
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,240
Nothing.

477
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,120
So let's go for a walk.

478
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,240
I don't want to go for a walk.

479
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,080
What do you want?

480
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,920
I want a handbag.

481
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,520
What is it?

482
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,480
I feel good, because I'm
not working this afternoon.

483
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,640
I feel like I'm skipping class.

484
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,600
Me too.

485
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,920
On top of that I'm drunk.

486
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,480
Better to be drunk in the
afternoon than in the evening.

487
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,920
It's much better this way.

488
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,600
We have the impression
we're keeping a secret.

489
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,880
Would you like anything else?
Maybe some ice cream?

490
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,320
I want a dress.

491
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,360
Have mercy.

492
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,600
OPERATION CAN'T BE PERFORMED

493
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,320
THANK YOU FOR YOUR VISIT

494
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,880
This one is gorgeous.

495
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,400
Castelles cake!
I love it!

496
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,760
Here you go.

497
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,880
I got you a place in first class.

498
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,760
Thank you.

499
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,080
So, good bye.

500
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,480
Good bye.

501
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,680
Wait.

502
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,520
Another 10 seconds.

503
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,600
The 10 seconds are up.

504
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,160
Fine.

505
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,280
Fine.

506
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,520
Fine, thank you.

507
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,120
Ask Jeff to come here.

508
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,320
You're not looking for a barman?

509
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,400
I have very good credentials.

510
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,560
No, sir.

511
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,480
I'm sorry sir, but I'm
forced to call the police.

512
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,240
Can't we work something out?

513
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,680
Pool man, room service,
porter, driver?

514
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,440
No, sir.

515
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,720
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

516
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,880
Can someone give me
a hand with my bag?

517
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,400
I'll send over Benoit.

518
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,160
Don't trouble yourself.

519
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,000
My friend will be delighted
to give me a hand.

520
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,640
You were very eager to
help me last time.

521
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,120
Add the bill of room 304
to the account of room 429.

522
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,960
- Shall we get out?
- Yes, of course.

523
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,080
And?

524
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,800
Will you close the door?

525
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,680
Yes.

526
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,000
Good evening.

527
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,480
Which floor?

528
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,760
The third floor.

529
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,200
Good morning, sir.

530
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,360
Good morning.

531
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,320
Is everything alright?

532
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,680
Impossible.
You'll never go away.

533
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,600
This isn't about you.

534
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,040
Yesterday I had a
problem with paying...

535
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,720
You have to leave me alone,
do you understand?

536
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,920
I have to work, Jean.

537
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:39,880
Calm down.

538
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,720
Do you think you can
go around having a crush?

539
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,560
It's not about that.

540
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,960
I met this woman and
she made me an offer...

541
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,840
Stop it.

542
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,880
I know why you're here.

543
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,120
I'm telling the truth.

544
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,560
You think I don't know
what's going on?

545
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,720
That I don't know that look?

546
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,600
Since I was 12 I've seen that look.

547
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,080
Good morning, Madeleine.

548
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,160
Did you sleep well?

549
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,560
Very well, thank you.

550
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,360
Have you picked something?

551
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,160
Excuse me?

552
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,600
Have you been served?

553
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,440
No, but everything is fine.

554
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,040
Won't you sit down?

555
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,360
Excuse me.

556
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,320
Shall I bring you something?

557
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,800
Not now.
That's nice of you, thank you.

558
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,080
What's going on?

559
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,960
You had a bad dream.

560
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,880
But that's good because
now you're awake.

561
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,040
I know what your color is.

562
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,280
You need something that's blue.

563
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,200
We'll keep the indigo shirt
and the lavender one,

564
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,800
the blue one and
the navy-blue one.

565
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,800
But certainly not those
two remaining ones.

566
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:53,360
Gilles?

567
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,320
Can you bring me that pink dress?

568
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,080
Yes.

569
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,120
And this one, Jean?

570
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,120
Yes.

571
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,240
It's gorgeous, isn't it?

572
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,640
Yes, I'm trying it on.

573
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,560
So... doing a little shopping?

574
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,120
A little.

575
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:20,760
And?

576
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,440
It's very nice.

577
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,760
She's the friend I told you about.

578
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,560
She's accepted to help
me for a while.

579
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,120
You don't call me miss anymore?

580
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,440
We have to pick something.

581
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,640
We can't buy 36 shirts.

582
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:34,760
And I've had enough.

583
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,120
I have to go.

584
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,280
My friend is in a hurry.

585
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,440
Can you spare me 10 seconds?

586
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,120
You look very nice in that shirt.

587
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:00,800
Thank you.

588
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:09,680
I'm coming.

589
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,920
I took two. I didn't know
which one you want.

590
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:13,840
Both.

591
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:14,960
Of course.

592
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,920
Finally you're smiling.

593
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,280
It's nice to be
well-dressed, isn't it?

594
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:28,920
Yes.

595
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,160
We're leaving.

596
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,480
Come in, the door is open.

597
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,400
4 days.

598
00:50:58,920 --> 00:50:59,880
What did you get?

599
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,120
Shirts.

600
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,800
Those 4 shirts?

601
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,360
And a pair of jeans.

602
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,920
That's it?

603
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,920
Today morning I had
a wonderful breakfast,

604
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,200
with room service.

605
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,200
And an extra serving of pancakes.

606
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,920
Jean, I can't believe it.

607
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,440
We haven't gone out much.

608
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,760
She's shafted you.

609
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,160
I'll wait a bit.

610
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,640
Wait for what?
That she'll marry you?

611
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,360
Take. Take as much as you can.

612
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,520
A new suit, glasses, shoes.
Take, Jean.

613
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,880
Otherwise what's it for?

614
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,600
Do you have 5 minutes?
I'm free until noon.

615
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,520
No, in half an hour I'm
going to a garden party.

616
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,440
I love such parties.

617
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,800
I'll look around and
maybe pick someone up.

618
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,600
The guy you're with now is no good?

619
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,080
I'm with him for the time being.

620
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:43,800
Why is that?

621
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,320
He's been divorced 4 times
and pays 4 ex-wives alimony.

622
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,280
He doesn't have much left.

623
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,040
Believe me, you can
find someone better.

624
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,080
- Is she married?
- She's a widow.

625
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,840
You're lucky.

626
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,520
When will you be back?

627
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:56,800
I don't know.

628
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,280
Will we see each other later?

629
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,040
Of course.

630
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,280
- We're neighbors, aren't we?
- Indeed.

631
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,440
Wombats and other koala bears,
who don't know what fear is,

632
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,960
always find out too late that
they can't defend themselves.

633
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,200
Are you alright?

634
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,440
I'm fine.

635
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,240
How was it?

636
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,640
Very good.

637
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,880
I have a gift for you.

638
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,080
What is it?

639
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:32,960
Guess.

640
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,160
Excellent, thank you.

641
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,000
I don't know...

642
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,080
A suit?

643
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,040
Glasses?

644
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,000
Shoes?

645
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:46,640
A bar of gold?

646
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,440
They're beautiful, aren't they?

647
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,200
Yes.
Very beautiful.

648
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,240
She can't treat you like that.

649
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,360
This can't go on.

650
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,320
She has the money.

651
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:25,960
So what?

652
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,080
You have a soul.

653
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,480
Youth.

654
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,520
Charm.

655
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,880
Make use of it.

656
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,760
Do you think I have charm?

657
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,040
You say that to someone
you don't find attractive.

658
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,480
But charm is more
valuable than beauty.

659
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,240
You can resist beauty,
but you can't resist charm.

660
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,600
Show me how you...

661
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,320
seduce someone.

662
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,040
How I seduce someone?

663
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,320
You must have a trick you practiced
in front of the mirror when you were 15.

664
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,520
No, I don't.

665
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,040
Improvise something.

666
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,800
Come on, start seducing me.

667
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,680
No...

668
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,280
Come on, do it by staring at me.

669
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,160
I can't do it just like that.

670
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:10,920
Go ahead.

671
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,720
Come on.

672
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,360
I just started.

673
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,600
I'm sorry.

674
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,640
Show me how you do it.

675
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,320
- Show me.
- Alright.

676
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,000
What's wrong Irene?

677
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,400
Nothing.
I...

678
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,480
I had...

679
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,480
I want to...

680
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,120
I'd like to...

681
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,280
What do you want?
What would you like?

682
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,960
This is what makes the
other person go crazy.

683
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,040
Not finishing your sentences.

684
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,680
As if the rest is too painful to say.

685
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,760
Not finishing your sentences
is very effective.

686
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,800
That and looking ahead and afar.

687
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,560
That'll get her.

688
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,640
Look.

689
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,040
I'm here...

690
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,960
and I'm gone.

691
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,080
And you have nice arms.

692
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,240
You should show them.

693
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,200
And you have nice hands.

694
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,280
What is that?

695
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,320
Damn... my watch's alarm.
She finished her meeting.

696
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,560
She set an alarm?

697
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,200
I have to go.

698
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,960
I can't believe it!
You aren't listening to me!

699
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:37,360
I am.

700
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,000
And?

701
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,040
I can't change everything right away.

702
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,360
I have to go slowly.

703
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:42,600
Dammit...

704
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,320
Give me that.
I know what to do.

705
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,080
You have to press...

706
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:47,920
There we go.

707
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,440
Why did you do that?

708
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,400
Because.

709
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,360
That was the end of our lesson
about the secret of womanhood.

710
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,440
Go.

711
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,280
Go or you'll be late.

712
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,520
PLASTIC SURGEON

713
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,560
This is ridiculous.

714
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,760
You don't need this.

715
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,240
You look very good.
You have no business being here.

716
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,880
Thank you, Jean.
That's nice of you.

717
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,160
I have no business being here,
because I come here regularly.

718
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,400
Hello.

719
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,320
Is everything alright
since your last visit?

720
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,200
Better and better.

721
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,040
Thanks.

722
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,280
Thank you.

723
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,320
I'm really happy with the result.

724
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,320
Me too.

725
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,240
Good.

726
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,360
So what's the matter with that ear?

727
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,760
That guy is the best.

728
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,480
Do you know what I had to do
to set up this appointment?

729
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,520
Do you know how long you have
to wait sometimes for breast surgery?

730
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,480
No. Is that the next procedure
you're planning for me?

731
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,080
Oh come on.

732
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,360
That was nothing.
A single stitch and 20 minutes.

733
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,920
Do you know what you
have to go through sometimes?

734
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,040
I can imagine.

735
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Jean, stop it.

736
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,760
Say something.
This silence makes me anxious.

737
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,840
I want to...

738
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,240
I'd like to...

739
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,200
What do you want?
What?

740
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,200
What would you like?

741
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,080
What do you want?

742
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,080
It's...
It's just...

743
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,840
Jean, look at your watch.

744
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,880
It's broken.

745
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,240
Driver take us to number 63.

746
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,160
The handle is made from shark bone.

747
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,120
Amazing, isn't it?

748
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,080
The bones are dried for 2 years.

749
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,720
It takes one shark to
make one set of cutlery.

750
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,520
Once I'm dead I'll donate
my body to them.

751
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,880
Excuse me.

752
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,160
- Do you have a light?
- Yes.

753
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,080
Thank you.

754
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,760
Do you think they sell it
at the hotel's boutique?

755
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,920
The watch?

756
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,880
No.
The cutlery.

757
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,160
Yes.
Of course.

758
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,520
I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.

759
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:58,520
Show me it.

760
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,080
Oh my goodness.
A Jaeger-LeCoultre watch.

761
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,120
Do know how much it's worth?

762
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,200
I can't even pronounce
such an amount.

763
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,280
You had a slow start,
but now you're rolling.

764
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,400
All this is white gold.

765
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,520
With diamonds all around.

766
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,240
And there's a diamond
on each number.

767
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,440
And inside there are rubies
and other stuff.

768
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,400
This isn't a watch.
It's a treasure chest.

769
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,880
What did you do to her?

770
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:18,720
I gave her the silent treatment.

771
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,000
You look nice.

772
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,400
Every rich guy looks nice to you.

773
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,080
You're not rich.
You've barely begun to be rich.

774
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,600
I never could have
expected any of this.

775
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,640
Go first.
I'll follow you.

776
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,000
- Jean?
- Yes?

777
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,960
What time is it?

778
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,280
A quarter to 9.

779
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:00,480
- It's nice here, isn't it?
- Yes.

780
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,120
I like this place because
it's not pretentious.

781
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,560
It's calm and grand
at the same time.

782
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,280
We have the impression
we're unique, don't we?

783
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,320
Yes.

784
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,640
The handle is made from shark bone.

785
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,800
Amazing, isn't it?

786
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,520
The bones are dried for 2 years.

787
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,400
It takes one shark to
make one set of cutlery.

788
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,960
Good evening, sir.
This is François from room service.

789
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,040
I'm sorry to disturb you.

790
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,200
We're unsure of something.

791
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,520
I need to clarify something
concerning your breakfast.

792
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,920
The juice that you ordered.

793
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,560
Should it be orange
or grapefruit?

794
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,520
Orange.

795
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:46,920
- Orange?
- Yes.

796
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,960
Maltaise, Navelle or Sanguine?

797
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:50,680
What?

798
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,000
Do you prefer a certain brand?

799
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,000
A what?

800
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,560
The brand of the juice.

801
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,040
- Maltaise.
- Excellent choice, sir.

802
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,240
We also have apple juice.

803
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,600
A very popular apple juice.
It's very much in demand.

804
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,640
It has a delicate flavor,
but has character.

805
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,200
Thank you very much.

806
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,800
Very well.

807
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,520
Sir, this is François again
from room service.

808
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,080
I'm sorry to be bothering you again.

809
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,160
Regarding the eggs.

810
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,880
Should they be soft-cooked, hard-cooked,
fried or boiled?

811
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:27,280
Soft-cooked.

812
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,320
Very well.

813
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,800
A very good choice.

814
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,760
- Anything else?
- No.

815
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,720
Are you sure, sir?

816
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,120
Fine.

817
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,040
Starting from a certain age,
a little ginseng added to your tea

818
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,680
improves blood circulation.

819
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,680
And I've also heard of
spectacular erections.

820
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,120
Is this room service?

821
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,280
Yes, this is room service.

822
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,080
Is this a joke?

823
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:52,840
Yes.. I mean, no.

824
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,240
No, this is not a joke, sir.

825
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,400
This is room service.

826
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,400
Have you been told about
the food for seniors?

827
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,040
No.

828
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,880
The food for seniors
is specially prepared

829
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,080
for our older clients.

830
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:14,600
There's nothing to chew.

831
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:20,440
The food is mechanically
chewed prior to serving,

832
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:25,000
so that you may enjoy
every kind of food,

833
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,720
in spite of a disability
of the jaw.

834
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,240
I can offer you soup,
purée and yogurt.

835
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,440
And stewed fruit for dessert.

836
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,240
Where were you?

837
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,600
I went to the bathroom.

838
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,360
Two visits to the bathroom
during a meal at your age?

839
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,600
I'm sorry... I...

840
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,320
What were you doing?

841
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,760
Were you talking to someone?

842
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,160
No.

843
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:04,520
You can tell me.

844
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:05,840
No.

845
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,640
You weren't talking to anyone
or you don't want to tell me?

846
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,440
I'm not jealous just curious.

847
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,560
I...

848
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,200
What's wrong, Jean?

849
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,640
Nothing... I...

850
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,720
I want to...

851
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,920
I'd like to...

852
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:33,840
Enough of this.

853
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,080
What do you think you're doing?

854
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,800
That you can play games with me

855
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,200
like with a young virgin?

856
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,840
Listen to me carefully, my boy.

857
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,200
If I want to I can
throw you out of here

858
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,760
with one snap of my fingers.

859
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,960
So if you want to continue
to enjoy the pool and the boutiques,

860
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,240
then you better show
some more concentration.

861
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,200
Do you understand?

862
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,520
I'm sorry I'm late.

863
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,200
We visited the boutiques.

864
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,920
- She bought you a scooter?
- Yes.

865
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,400
It has a luggage box.

866
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,040
And a full tank.

867
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,760
We can go for a swim.

868
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,880
I know this nice place by the sea.

869
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,680
I've been wanting to go
there since arriving here.

870
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:25,840
We'll go there now.

871
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,880
Order me a glass and
I'll be right back.

872
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,840
We made a good choice
by picking this suit.

873
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:46,680
It's very nice.

874
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,080
- Good night.
- Good night.

875
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,200
You were right.

876
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,760
It's good to go to bed early.

877
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,880
It was nice of you to cancel
our dinner at the restaurant.

878
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:39,840
Really?

879
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:43,120
Yes. It's as if you gave me a gift.

880
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,200
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

881
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,640
You're really not hungry this evening?

882
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:57,680
No I'm not.

883
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,240
That's something rare, isn't it?

884
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:00,920
That's true.

885
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,840
Do you want some candy?

886
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,880
No, thank you.

887
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,320
I own some of the producer's stock.
It makes me good money.

888
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:30,600
Where are you from?

889
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,200
Excuse me?

890
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:34,640
Where are you from?

891
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:35,720
I'm from Saint-Brieux.

892
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:36,840
Saint-Brieux?

893
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,120
Is it nice there?

894
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,040
It rains all the time.

895
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:53,080
Do you know that I haven't
seen the rain in 4 years?

896
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,000
It's always summer here.

897
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,120
I miss the smell of rain.

898
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,040
Do you have any siblings?

899
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:20,480
No.

900
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,600
I have 2 brothers and 3 sisters.

901
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,320
And my oldest sister
would always tease me.

902
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:28,840
I mean that...

903
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,440
You haven't said anything.

904
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,600
It's very nice here.

905
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,120
I lack the words to describe it.

906
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,440
Behind us is an abandoned vineyard.

907
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,120
I find grapes there in September.

908
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,160
And up there, to your left...

909
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,280
There's an old sheep house.

910
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,240
Do you see it?

911
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,080
I can barely see my sandwich.

912
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,240
Dammit.
Impossible.

913
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:55,760
Jean, excuse me.

914
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,640
It would be lovely if you could
bring me my book from our room.

915
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,440
Irene?

916
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,480
Is everything alright?

917
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,320
I wanted to tell you that
I spent a wonderful night.

918
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:20,680
Me too.

919
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,040
When can we do it again?

920
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,200
I didn't want to
fall asleep, you know.

921
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,680
So that I could savor each minute.

922
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,960
What's wrong?

923
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,360
I'm leaving.

924
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:44,880
I came to say good bye.

925
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:48,600
Where to?

926
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,360
I'm going to Venice.

927
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,440
With Gilles.

928
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,400
And then to the Maldives.

929
01:14:58,880 --> 01:14:59,720
When?

930
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:02,840
This evening.

931
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,400
When are you coming back?

932
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:11,160
I'm not coming back.

933
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,800
When I was a kid I went to
Venice once with my parents.

934
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,080
I remember the bread rolls
they had there. I adored them.

935
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:26,920
I don't remember their name.

936
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:30,960
Do you know which ones?

937
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,080
Yes.

938
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,640
I also don't remember their name.

939
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,000
And I also adore them.

940
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,600
So... good bye.

941
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,120
Jean, are you here?

942
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:51,520
Here you are.

943
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,280
Is everything alright?

944
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:54,320
Yes.

945
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,160
The book was here.

946
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:57,480
Thank you.

947
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:03,840
Madeleine, what's the name of
those Italian bread rolls?

948
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:15,200
Oh no...

949
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,480
Oh no, this can't be true...

950
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,080
That bastard...
Not again...

951
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:25,800
Dammit...

952
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,680
The bread rolls are called panettones.

953
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,400
That idiot dumped me.

954
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:55,960
He dumped you?

955
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:57,920
He left me here.

956
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,280
And took everything.

957
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:00,000
But why?

958
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,320
And what do you think?

959
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:02,800
Do you think he saw us?

960
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,000
Of course he saw us.

961
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,040
I can't believe it.
I'm so stupid.

962
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:09,760
You have to go to the train station.

963
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,760
I keep my things there
in a luggage box.

964
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,480
Dammit... I have nothing.

965
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:18,480
I only have this cover
and the swimming suit.

966
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:40,920
Miss?

967
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:42,640
This is for you.

968
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,880
The room has been paid
for the whole week.

969
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,320
Are you alright?

970
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,200
Yes.
I'm fine.

971
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,240
You look a little nervous.

972
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:04,240
No, I'm not nervous.

973
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:07,720
What will you have?

974
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,160
I'll have a vodka.

975
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,480
We'll have a scotch
whisky and a vodka.

976
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:13,800
Where's your watch?

977
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:16,800
I sold it.

978
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,560
That's not true.
It's in our room.

979
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,760
No, I sold it at the same boutique.

980
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:25,480
But...

981
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,640
It was mine, wasn't it?

982
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:29,520
Yes.

983
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,040
I wanted to believe
you're a little different.

984
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,640
Not like the others.

985
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,320
But you're only more
clever than they are.

986
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,200
I don't know what came over me.

987
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,440
I wanted to buy you a gift,
but I had no money.

988
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,920
So... here you go.

989
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,480
They're gorgeous.

990
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,240
This is charming, Jean.

991
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,800
That watch was the
only thing you had.

992
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,480
I'm sure I gave you the invitation.

993
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:36,000
No. The invitation was
on your nightstand.

994
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,240
Most likely the cleaning
lady took it.

995
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:40,640
It doesn't matter.

996
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:29,800
Excuse me.

997
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:31,680
Do you have a light?

998
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,720
Can I bring you some champagne?

999
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:13,920
That would be charming.

1000
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,480
5 glasses, please.

1001
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:24,400
Thank you.

1002
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,200
You're a prince.

1003
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,840
I will be needing your help, Jean.

1004
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,160
Of course. How can I help?

1005
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,200
I saw Jacques.

1006
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:20,640
You need to help me.

1007
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:21,600
In what way?

1008
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:23,920
I want you to help me...

1009
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:26,640
seduce him.

1010
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:32,680
Things can't go on like this, Jean.

1011
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,480
That situation at the
pool was just too hard.

1012
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,440
I don't want to find myself
without anything again.

1013
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:39,520
I prefer to...

1014
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:40,720
What do you want me to do?

1015
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:44,280
Tell me.

1016
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,000
Excuse me.

1017
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:03,440
A glass of champagne, please.

1018
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:06,840
One for you?

1019
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:07,920
Yes.

1020
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:09,480
One more glass, please.

1021
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,040
Thank you.

1022
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,840
Getting some champagne is real madness.

1023
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:14,960
When did you arrive?

1024
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:16,520
About 10 minutes ago.

1025
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:17,600
Are you alone?

1026
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:19,360
Yes, for now.

1027
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,480
- And you?
- No.

1028
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,240
Here's to our health.

1029
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,280
- Irene.
- Agnes.

1030
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:33,000
Impossible...

1031
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:33,920
What?

1032
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,200
This is my lucky day.

1033
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:37,280
What is it?

1034
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,560
- The Prince von Hoffenberg.
- Who?

1035
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:42,280
The Prince von Hoffenberg.
There, near the roses.

1036
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:43,760
Who is he?

1037
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,600
A mover and shaker of this world.

1038
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,520
He's a Dutch nobleman.

1039
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,800
And he's an industrial tycoon.

1040
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:53,520
He must have just arrived.

1041
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
He's very rich

1042
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:57,640
and very lonely.

1043
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,000
He lost his wife in
a car accident 2 years ago.

1044
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,400
And since then he's
in such a poor shape.

1045
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,520
I'll go to him
and take my chances.

1046
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,040
Excuse me.

1047
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:17,880
Is it at her you're looking?

1048
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,200
Yes.

1049
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:21,960
Is she looking at you?

1050
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,880
Yes. She's taking shy
glances at me.

1051
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:26,560
She wants to get married.

1052
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,240
Here you go.

1053
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:29,880
I noticed you hadn't any left.

1054
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:31,880
Thank you.

1055
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,040
Good evening.

1056
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:35,560
This is Agnes, my friend.

1057
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:38,600
- Prince Michel...
- ...von Hoffenberg.

1058
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:39,520
Of course.

1059
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,760
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1060
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:43,480
I'm rarely recognized.

1061
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,040
But you have a face
that's impossible to forget.

1062
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:48,920
Have you just arrived?

1063
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,280
I don't intend to
stay here too long.

1064
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,440
- I think this is a little...
- Yes, that's true.

1065
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:53,240
You think the same?

1066
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,200
I couldn't help myself from
looking at you all evening.

1067
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:00,880
I'm sorry.

1068
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:02,720
No need to be sorry.

1069
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,360
You remind me of someone.

1070
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,400
The Princess of Edinburgh.

1071
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:10,840
- Excuse me, Ines.
- Irene.

1072
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,360
I'm sorry.

1073
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,520
Don't mention it.
Maybe we can see each other later?

1074
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:19,520
I have her portrait, painted by
Rembrandt, at my country house.

1075
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,560
I hung it in the guest room.

1076
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:25,600
I'd like to show it to you.

1077
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,200
The resemblance is striking.

1078
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:30,840
She was executed during the revolution.

1079
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,760
Oh my God...
I'm so sorry.

1080
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,400
The pain has passed.

1081
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,920
Excuse me for a moment.

1082
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,880
You're behaving like a rude bastard.

1083
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:48,320
For the past hour you've been
going from one woman to the next.

1084
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,600
What are you doing?
Who do you think you are?

1085
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,600
Do you think a little
jewel is enough?

1086
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:53,520
I'm sorry, Madeleine.

1087
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,040
I don't give a damn
that you're sorry.

1088
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,520
You told my friends you'll
bring us some champagne, so do it.

1089
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:58,800
You have 2 minutes to bring it.

1090
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,760
I'd be happy to help, but I can't.

1091
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,440
What do you mean you can't?

1092
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,560
I need to go to the hotel and
spend a few hours with this girl.

1093
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:09,440
What are you talking about?

1094
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:11,240
I need to do a favor.
I can't do otherwise.

1095
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:12,720
Are you kidding me?

1096
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:13,360
I'm warning you.

1097
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,960
If you leave with that girl,
don't count on me, understand?

1098
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:19,400
I'll leave the scooter at the
parking lot and the keys at reception.

1099
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,000
There's nothing I can
do to stop you?

1100
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:27,840
No.

1101
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:31,400
I'm sorry.

1102
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,320
Stop being so nice.
It's unbearable.

1103
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,720
It seems that a man
like you can't be bought.

1104
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:38,800
Even by me.

1105
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,920
I'll be fine, don't worry.
You're not the first.

1106
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,480
Thank you for approaching
things this way.

1107
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:47,960
Do I have a choice?

1108
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,160
You can keep the scooter.

1109
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,680
You deserve it.

1110
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:07,440
I'm sorry...

1111
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:09,520
That was my ex mother-in-law.

1112
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,400
The Baroness von Bosten.

1113
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,560
She can't stand that
I talk to other women since...

1114
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:14,280
Yes.

1115
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:15,240
I know.

1116
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:20,360
Don't hold it against her.

1117
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,520
She's suffering because of it.

1118
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,440
But I have to live on, right?

1119
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:25,920
Yes, of course.
One must live on.

1120
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:27,600
Life goes on.

1121
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,040
Are you alright?

1122
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,320
No...
Yes.

1123
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:37,680
I want to...

1124
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:39,400
I'd like to...

1125
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:21,360
Well well.

1126
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:22,800
Good evening, Jacques.

1127
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,240
Good evening, Irene.

1128
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,760
You see. I still
remember your name.

1129
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:28,800
Are you alone?

1130
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:30,040
As you can see.

1131
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,920
What have you been doing?

1132
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,320
I've been signing checks.

1133
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:50,320
When did you arrive?

1134
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:54,720
I arrived this morning.
I was dumped this evening.

1135
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:57,120
Not all is lost.

1136
01:31:58,720 --> 01:31:59,480
It seems so.

1137
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,680
I think I've already
forgotten her name.

1138
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,000
Excuse me.
What did you say?

1139
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,680
That I've already
forgotten her name.

1140
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:17,000
Agnes.

1141
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,520
You know her?

1142
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:21,760
Small world.

1143
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:24,760
Are you alright?

1144
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,800
Yes. I'm fine.

1145
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:31,960
Do you have any plans
for the coming days?

1146
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:35,480
Do you have any plans?

1147
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:37,520
Excuse me?

1148
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,800
I have this impression
your thoughts are elsewhere.

1149
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:43,960
And I don't like it.

1150
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:46,640
Excuse me.

1151
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:47,720
Pardon me.

1152
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,840
It's the alcohol and the fatigue.

1153
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,320
I'm falling asleep.

1154
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:54,400
What were you saying?

1155
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:56,840
I asked if you had any plans.

1156
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:01,600
What are you plans
for the coming days?

1157
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:08,760
Love.

1158
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,000
I plan to make love.

1159
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:16,840
Excuse me.

1160
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:18,520
Excuse me, Jacques.

1161
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:19,720
I'm sorry.

1162
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,040
Excuse me.

1163
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,680
I'm really sorry.

1164
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,840
Prince?
What's going on?

1165
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:25,360
What are you doing here?

1166
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:26,360
I'm doing you a favor.

1167
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,240
He's not a prince.

1168
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:38,160
I can't believe it.

1169
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:40,040
Excuse me.

1170
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:42,880
Well...

1171
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,640
It took you a while.

1172
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:47,080
