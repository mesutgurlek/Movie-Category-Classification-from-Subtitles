1
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,134
- Run for it!
- Come on, Lisa! Go, go, go!

2
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:36,332
Go for second!

3
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,350
It's gonna be close.

4
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:47,583
Yeah, Lisa!

5
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:49,312
United States wins gold!

6
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:53,556
You did it!

7
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,329
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

8
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:59,362
Yeah, Lisa!

9
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,796
So basically we're down to
three choices for the last slot.

10
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,029
Lisa's here to see you.
I'm glad you're meeting with her...

11
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:09,903
...because when it comes to this girl,
the intangibles are everything.

12
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:12,203
She's been the heartbeat
of this program.

13
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:14,074
Just let me think for a second.

14
00:02:14,247 --> 00:02:17,375
She did the Olympics and
two championships without an error.

15
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,883
- She practices, what?
- Three hours every day.

16
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:22,521
She makes everyone better. Coach?

17
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:25,624
I have the benefit of being new here.

18
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:28,018
Lisa is 31.

19
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:30,925
She's 0.3 seconds slower
moving towards first.

20
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:35,693
I'm tired of justifying myself because
you're hung up on her as a role model.

21
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:38,895
Nobody's gonna change his mind.
It's over.

22
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:41,336
- What's that?
- It's your call.

23
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,471
Hooray! Thank you. Thank you.

24
00:02:43,643 --> 00:02:46,874
At least let her know today.
She'll have to redirect her life.

25
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:50,210
Everyone finds out when
I post it online. No exceptions.

26
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:52,180
Because we field women athletes...

27
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:55,287
...doesn't mean we get girly
when someone's time is up.

28
00:02:55,455 --> 00:02:56,479
Holy crap.

29
00:02:57,357 --> 00:02:58,517
I beg your pardon?

30
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:01,354
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:03,795
Oh, my Lord.
What is to become of me?

32
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:07,229
I've lost my ability
to smile at bastards.

33
00:03:11,104 --> 00:03:12,799
Still got it.

34
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:15,365
Can we?

35
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:20,002
- I can't see her. Tell her I'm too busy.
- How's it going?

36
00:03:21,915 --> 00:03:23,177
Three, three, three!

37
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:29,755
Let's go, people!

38
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:33,051
- Faster!
- Good stretch, Smalls!

39
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:36,661
- Go, baby! Attaway!
- Right here!

40
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,388
Faster!

41
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:43,034
- Hey, whose phone?
- AI right, look up.

42
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:45,361
Oh, man.

43
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:47,632
- Smalls, are you okay?
- Yeah.

44
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:49,998
This better be worth it.

45
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:52,644
- You gotta watch out.
- Yeah.

46
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,145
- Hello?
- Hi.

47
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:57,306
This is George Madison.

48
00:03:57,484 --> 00:04:01,716
I think you might know that Riva
gave me your phone number.

49
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:04,686
No.

50
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:07,622
She thought it might be a good idea
if we had dinner.

51
00:04:07,794 --> 00:04:09,955
I'll call her.
When did you have in mind?

52
00:04:10,263 --> 00:04:12,823
No, I wasn't calling to set a time.

53
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:15,490
She didn't know that
I was seeing someone.

54
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:19,168
Well, she didn't know
that it had escalated a bit.

55
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,432
At least on my part.

56
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:24,273
It just added up for me suddenly.

57
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:26,746
So you're calling me to break up?

58
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:30,641
- You can't just walk in there.
- No, I just didn't think...

59
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:32,041
George Madison.

60
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:35,085
I'm sorry. I got distracted.
What was I saying?

61
00:04:35,422 --> 00:04:37,913
You were saying
you just didn't think.

62
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:40,857
Right, right. Thank you.

63
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:43,254
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

64
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:45,691
Thank you for holding.

65
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:49,163
I just didn't think it was right
not to phone you...

66
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:53,668
...once I took your number, in case you
had talked and were expecting my call.

67
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,106
Okay. Well, it was nice of you to call,
in a way, I guess.

68
00:04:58,345 --> 00:04:59,778
Right.

69
00:05:01,014 --> 00:05:02,982
Sorry for interrupting your day.

70
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:04,446
- Yeah.
- Goodbye.

71
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:05,676
Bye.

72
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:08,787
Weirdo. I'm gonna kill Riva. Let's go.

73
00:05:08,955 --> 00:05:11,082
All right, ladies, let's go!

74
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,524
Oh, my God.

75
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:27,063
- So you gave my number to a guy?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,732
I hardly know him, but he went
to business school with my brother.

77
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,673
So why did you give him
my number?

78
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:35,043
You don't remember
Wednesday night?

79
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:39,179
You said you had never dated
a non-athlete.

80
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:42,014
"I should date a non-athlete,
right, Riva?"

81
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:43,416
That's what you said.

82
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,058
Don't listen to me when
I'm drinking Guinness.

83
00:05:46,426 --> 00:05:48,656
It's the only time you really say stuff.

84
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:50,955
I hope that's not true.

85
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:55,761
This exercise is for next time, okay?
Thank you.

86
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:00,873
George.

87
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:03,800
Didn't I say I was crashing
on my book?

88
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:06,343
Yeah, you did. I'm not gonna stay.

89
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:08,447
Maybe that's better for tonight.

90
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:15,077
Look, if you're concerned about us
now that we've intensified...

91
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:17,246
...we're okay. I am busy...

92
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:21,459
...so I can't demonstrate to you
we're okay in the little ways...

93
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:24,256
...like paying attention to you...

94
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:29,368
...but if you could take my word for it
until work lets up, that would help me.

95
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:30,594
And us.

96
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:34,636
I think I like that word better.

97
00:06:36,276 --> 00:06:37,368
Us.

98
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:39,941
T... Today I...

99
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:46,545
It was nice just to see your face
for a minute. It settles me down.

100
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:50,045
Great game last night, Matty.
Who's your date?

101
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:51,485
You're the best pitcher.

102
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:53,626
- Can I get your autograph?
- Got a pen?

103
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:56,819
- He's the cutest pitcher in baseball.
- Rocking that mound!

104
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:59,590
Hold on, hold on.
You guys ready? Okay.

105
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:02,166
- Here, one more over here.
- Lisa!

106
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:06,328
- To the right!
- The right.

107
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,442
- Thanks for everything.
- You're awesome!

108
00:07:16,116 --> 00:07:18,846
The night is so great.
You look so good.

109
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:22,112
Just needed to grab you.
We're here.

110
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:24,347
- Good evening, Mr. Reynolds.
- Tom.

111
00:07:24,524 --> 00:07:27,459
Matty, I might have to
go back on what I said...

112
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:29,857
...about finally seeing
your place tonight.

113
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:31,860
I just have a lot on my mind.

114
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:33,457
Okay, are you sure?

115
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,528
Well...

116
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:37,027
...no.

117
00:07:37,203 --> 00:07:39,637
There's no pressure.
It should feel right.

118
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:40,864
That's nice.

119
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:43,106
Thanks.

120
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,702
Why are you moving away?

121
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:48,510
I wanna give you room
to think and decide.

122
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:07,689
You have all the signs of a handful.

123
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:09,732
I hope so.

124
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:12,634
You better hang on to that energy.

125
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,081
Wait till you try this.
Blender wake you?

126
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:35,125
It's worth it. Because these things
are gonna blow your mind.

127
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,658
Amazing sex.

128
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,765
Female jocks are amazing.

129
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:51,070
Thanks, but maybe could you
personalize it a little?

130
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:55,211
Oh, yeah. Right, right, right.
That's what I'm saying to you, Lisa.

131
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:58,541
It's like, come on, that was...
That was unbelievable.

132
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:01,184
Yeah.

133
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:03,413
Are you fishing
for a compliment or...?

134
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,185
I'm fishing for a celebration!
Come on!

135
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,328
It was good.

136
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:13,264
Here, come on.

137
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,138
- It's good.
- It's great.

138
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:26,110
- It's great.
- There you go.

139
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,247
- Yeah.
- Good.

140
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:32,946
I have to get going.
Which way is the bathroom?

141
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:35,519
- It's just right over there.
- Okay.

142
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:38,219
But I'm gonna drink the rest of this...

143
00:09:38,391 --> 00:09:41,326
...because it was really sweet of you
to make it.

144
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:43,253
It's great.

145
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:46,131
So you know that many
female athletes?

146
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:47,323
Yeah, I do.

147
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,992
I mean, you gotta count cheerleaders,
but yeah.

148
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:58,805
Toothbrushes are in that drawer
on the right there.

149
00:09:58,978 --> 00:10:00,843
Oh, okay.

150
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:10,214
No.

151
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:12,990
No. You don't have to
wear that dress home.

152
00:10:13,826 --> 00:10:16,090
- What?
- Come here.

153
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:19,258
What size? Small or extra small?

154
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:21,700
Wait, what is that?

155
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,665
- What?
- That. Behind you.

156
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:31,770
That is repulsive. The stack.

157
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:33,207
- No.
- No?

158
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:36,871
No, no. No, it's me being classy.
It's me being a good host.

159
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,280
No. No. No.

160
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:43,482
I feel like I'm on an assembly line
that's just spitting out girls.

161
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:46,352
That's just negative. That's like...

162
00:10:46,526 --> 00:10:49,495
Though if you think about it,
and I never did till now...

163
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:54,725
...we're all on kind of an assembly line,
just going through each other's lives.

164
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:57,529
Until one day,
you close the factory down...

165
00:10:57,704 --> 00:11:02,698
...take one product home and use it
monogamously for the rest of your life.

166
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:05,969
- My mistake, Matty. Forget it.
- No, I'm not...

167
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:08,705
It's not a mistake.
I'm just saying that...

168
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:11,907
If I'd given you one and hid the rest,
I'd be a great guy?

169
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:15,077
- But because I was open with you...
- I said, forget it!

170
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:34,036
Matty, what am I doing?

171
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:35,731
I caught myself.

172
00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:38,172
Don't judge others
till you check yourself.

173
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:42,041
You're lucky if it's your fault,
you can correct the situation.

174
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,444
I'm nervous over something
that's going on with me.

175
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,054
I'm with an attractive guy
you'd be an idiot...

176
00:11:50,223 --> 00:11:53,590
...to mistake for anything more
than just a fun friendship.

177
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,160
And, yes, amazing sex.

178
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,892
Instead, I give that guy a hard time
for just being who he is.

179
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:06,268
Totally my fault.

180
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:08,335
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:11,142
Please forgive me.

182
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:15,305
- Are you apologizing?
- Yeah.

183
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:20,175
If you're really apologizing,
you may be my dream girl.

184
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:22,184
I heard footsteps and I'm like:

185
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:25,256
"Okay, somebody nuts is coming back
to be more nuts."

186
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:29,657
And now, an apology?
You may be my dream girl.

187
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:31,853
Yeah.

188
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:18,743
They said you'd be in here.

189
00:13:20,146 --> 00:13:21,977
How bad is this?

190
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:30,980
The Justice Department is investigating
the company for security fraud.

191
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:34,325
- Based on what? Why are they...?
- They don't have to say.

192
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:36,792
They've subpoenaed
everything from abroad.

193
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:40,455
- You didn't tell your father? The worst...
- Of course I told him.

194
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:42,294
- No.
- Yes.

195
00:13:42,468 --> 00:13:44,663
He's gonna meet us in my office
right now.

196
00:13:45,204 --> 00:13:48,230
- Your concern is?
- I don't have one.

197
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:51,240
Well, we better go.

198
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:53,472
I agree.

199
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:57,848
- Morning.
- Morning, Dad.

200
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:06,350
We need the company lawyer for
whatever this is? What's going on?

201
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:14,032
- You want a kiss too?
- Not today.

202
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:16,562
- You haven't read this yet?
- Just once.

203
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:18,226
They are investigating us...

204
00:14:18,404 --> 00:14:21,430
...for misstatement of receivables
to inflate earnings.

205
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:23,734
- Stock fraud.
- What do you know about it?

206
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:26,438
Nothing. But I'm responsible.

207
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:28,312
What, are you being noble?

208
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:30,813
I'm telling you what
recent legislation says.

209
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:33,451
If it's true and I didn't know,
I should have.

210
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:38,119
Can you ask your assistant to come in?
We have to respond immediately.

211
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:45,687
Annie, could you please come on in?
And bring your laptop.

212
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,161
All these items mentioned...

213
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:54,773
...you must have checked whether we
had funds before talking to the analyst.

214
00:14:55,274 --> 00:15:00,211
No. Most of them came from
Dad's office, so I assumed that...

215
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:03,212
...with everyone working...
- You do not assume.

216
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:05,282
- Excuse me.
- You do not trust anyone.

217
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:06,577
Not him, not me.

218
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:08,886
Cynicism is sanity.

219
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,886
Good guidelines, I'm afraid.

220
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:14,993
I assumed that with everyone
working creatively on the new line...

221
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:16,924
"Creatively."

222
00:15:17,096 --> 00:15:18,256
Just a second, Dad.

223
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:19,926
- Now...
- Let me finish.

224
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:25,236
No! Drivel does not get to finish.
Drivel gets interrupted.

225
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:27,095
Is it possible to get the...?

226
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:30,333
So shaping the corporate culture
might not bring results...

227
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:33,034
You are a fucking moron!

228
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:34,679
- Too rough.
- Much too rough.

229
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:39,580
- Don't talk like that in front of Annie.
- Okay! Okay. I caught myself.

230
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,354
Now may I get back to the...

231
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,823
Sorry, Annie. The fucking...

232
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:51,619
Sorry again, Annie.

233
00:15:51,797 --> 00:15:53,355
Point.

234
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:58,401
I have overlooked every limitation
I know you to have.

235
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:01,802
Why? Because you are my son.

236
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:06,444
And you're a good guy,
as every prick with half a brain...

237
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:09,638
...who ever took advantage of you
knows absolutely.

238
00:16:09,815 --> 00:16:13,046
But, Gidge,
there is a bottom line here...

239
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:17,553
...which is, because of your
notions of trust and creativity...

240
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:23,457
...we may be inevitably forced to crawl
on by some assistant U.S. Attorney.

241
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:26,325
And if this "almost made
the law review" creature...

242
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:29,059
...pins me between
a choice of saving you...

243
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:32,170
...or the company that I founded
and you preside over...

244
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:35,199
...I may be forced
to choose the company...

245
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:40,038
...even though doing so may break my
life forever, which is finally my fault...

246
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:43,409
...for handing you a job
where your pathetic assumptions...

247
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:46,949
...or notions of trust
can cause such calamity!

248
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:48,177
Annie!

249
00:16:48,354 --> 00:16:51,084
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
Excuse me.

250
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:54,359
What? Darling, are you crying?
What's wrong?

251
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,586
I'm fine. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

252
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:01,660
- Charles, Annie just...
- Ron.

253
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:05,663
Why don't you have Annie take down
everything you need, okay?

254
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:11,100
- Okay?
- All right.

255
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:16,103
You should go home now
and think about interviewing attorneys.

256
00:17:16,282 --> 00:17:18,944
I don't know if the company
will be allowed to pay.

257
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:20,842
The company will pay.

258
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,923
To the Justice Department:

259
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:28,723
The individual's name is on here.

260
00:17:28,894 --> 00:17:32,193
All documents relating
to loan applications.

261
00:17:32,365 --> 00:17:36,734
All financial statements, including
general ledgers, income statements...

262
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:46,442
Oh, God.

263
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:51,572
The term "document" includes,
but is not limited to, all personal files...

264
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:53,616
...telephone messages, and...

265
00:17:57,323 --> 00:17:58,790
Just a minute.

266
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:10,163
Hello?

267
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:13,772
George. I have been
through things like this...

268
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:18,774
...and I'd like to give you some difficult
advice, if you would like to hear it.

269
00:18:19,378 --> 00:18:20,402
Okay.

270
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:23,982
Accept the enormity.

271
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,914
Give up illusions of containment.
The hardest fact...

272
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:30,419
...is that,
no matter what the outcome...

273
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:36,550
...it is unlikely you can ever again be
the person you have been until now.

274
00:18:38,697 --> 00:18:42,463
Okay, thanks.
Look, can I call you later?

275
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:46,469
Any further contact between us
would be inappropriate.

276
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:49,433
Good luck, George.

277
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:58,745
Is Bryant there yet?
Yeah, it's George.

278
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:01,409
Look, I need to speak with him.

279
00:19:01,787 --> 00:19:04,813
Yeah, well,
reach him as soon as you can.

280
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,514
Thank you.

281
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:13,130
Hi, this is George.
I've left you four messages, all urgent.

282
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:16,962
You know I underplay, so I don't
understand your failure to call back.

283
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,237
Thank you.

284
00:19:19,705 --> 00:19:22,139
Well? Tell me.
You must have some reaction.

285
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:24,734
No, I have one.

286
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,878
I'm just not proud of it.

287
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,744
It's just me being analytical.

288
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:33,481
I was thinking about my work.

289
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:35,142
Let me explain the thought.

290
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:47,455
This is for us, I swear it.

291
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:53,203
We are not well-matched
for this interval in your life.

292
00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:56,671
Not with me against this deadline
and you being investigated.

293
00:19:56,842 --> 00:20:00,073
I don't want our relationship
to become cannon fodder...

294
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:03,044
...for this apparition
in your working life.

295
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:06,346
I will be here for you at the end.

296
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,850
You can count on that.

297
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:12,686
You wanna split up
until I'm problem-free?

298
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:14,120
Please, I'd appreciate...

299
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:18,354
You're breaking up with...? Oh, my...
You're breaking up with...?

300
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:21,056
I'm hitting the pause button.

301
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:24,930
So that we don't waste
our precious energies on stuff.

302
00:21:23,095 --> 00:21:24,722
No.

303
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:27,127
No. No.

304
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:30,292
Nope. No, thank you.

305
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,708
Tonight I'm in

306
00:21:37,276 --> 00:21:41,212
A romantic mood, yeah

307
00:21:41,847 --> 00:21:44,145
Let's take a shower

308
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:47,582
Shower together

309
00:21:49,254 --> 00:21:51,484
I'll wash your body

310
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:54,717
You wash mine, yeah

311
00:21:56,462 --> 00:22:01,593
Rub me down
With some hot oils, baby

312
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:02,901
Yeah

313
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,706
Hello. Hello?

314
00:22:12,978 --> 00:22:14,002
Hello?

315
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:15,840
- Hi, boss.
- Hi.

316
00:22:16,015 --> 00:22:18,040
- How are you? It's not too late...
- No.

317
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:21,115
I'm fine. It's fine.
Hold on just a second.

318
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:22,344
Okay.

319
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:30,993
Hey. Thanks so much for calling.

320
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,756
I can't sleep. I don't know
what got into me this morning.

321
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:37,401
I have never taken a swat
at anybody.

322
00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:39,560
Well, I do know. I'm pregnant.

323
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:41,929
You're preg... You're pregnant!

324
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:46,042
Yeah. Secret's out.

325
00:22:46,445 --> 00:22:48,504
You're pregnant!

326
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:50,410
I had a hunch.

327
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:00,691
That guy that picks you up
sometimes, Al?

328
00:23:01,226 --> 00:23:02,750
Oh, you noticed Al.

329
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:05,225
He lights up every time
he sees you.

330
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:06,930
So good, huh?

331
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:09,693
He's great. He's just
been out of work lately.

332
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:12,530
So we've just been
marathon worrying.

333
00:23:12,705 --> 00:23:15,697
So I'm not myself lately.
So when your father...

334
00:23:15,874 --> 00:23:17,364
Oh, don't worry about it.

335
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:22,076
So did you tell Terry
about what happened to you?

336
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:24,373
I'd rather not get into that.

337
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,144
She bailed? You should go call...

338
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:31,119
...another girl. Distract yourself.
Right?

339
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:33,482
Forward motion.

340
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:36,421
They can't stop girls
from talking to you.

341
00:23:36,895 --> 00:23:39,329
My God, is that it?
They're directing people...

342
00:23:39,498 --> 00:23:41,489
...not to talk to me?

343
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:50,739
I had to sign a confidentiality statement
where I'm liable financially if I...

344
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:53,241
With this new situation...
You know what?

345
00:23:53,412 --> 00:23:56,006
The hell with everything!
So I lose my job.

346
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:59,378
Wait, honey, I can't. "Honey." Sorry.
My medical would lapse.

347
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:02,520
I've gotta care for my baby.
Al still hasn't proposed...

348
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:06,681
You won't lose your job, Annie, okay?
All right? Don't tell me anything.

349
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:09,017
Sorry, boss.

350
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,793
Thanks a lot.

351
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:14,622
You have a good night, Annie.

352
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:17,929
I am just dying for you.

353
00:24:18,137 --> 00:24:20,503
That's a little extreme.

354
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:22,605
Just be nauseous for me.

355
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:26,567
Yeah. A little morning sick for me.

356
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:28,440
Not a problem.

357
00:24:51,303 --> 00:24:55,137
- Hello?
- Hi. Lisa. This is George.

358
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:57,233
George Madison.

359
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:03,648
I... I'm not sure how to
further identify myself.

360
00:25:04,316 --> 00:25:06,216
Your voice sounds a little familiar.

361
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:09,684
I made this incredibly stupid
phone call to you a few days ago.

362
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:13,222
Oh, right. How you doing, George?

363
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:15,655
Would you like to have dinner?

364
00:25:16,228 --> 00:25:18,822
- But aren't you?
- No, I am not.

365
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:22,362
- You see...
- You don't have to explain.

366
00:25:22,534 --> 00:25:25,332
I'm sort of seeing somebody,
but we can have a meal.

367
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:28,034
- When?
- Anytime.

368
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:29,231
Tomorrow's clear.

369
00:25:29,408 --> 00:25:31,205
- Triplo Due?
- I'll meet you there.

370
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:35,244
- It's Triple Two in English.
- It's gotta be early, 6:00. I'm in training.

371
00:25:36,181 --> 00:25:39,082
Okay. So it's a d... It's a date.

372
00:25:39,251 --> 00:25:41,219
- Okay.
- All right.

373
00:25:41,386 --> 00:25:43,581
- I have made a date.
- Bye.

374
00:25:43,755 --> 00:25:45,313
Good night.

375
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,153
Come on, come on.

376
00:28:19,144 --> 00:28:21,977
Georgie. George.

377
00:28:22,247 --> 00:28:24,306
- Let's go inside.
- I have a date.

378
00:28:24,483 --> 00:28:28,351
Date? Son, we are in
a rapidly evolving situation here.

379
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,853
I must tell you, I was afraid
to use the telephone.

380
00:28:32,024 --> 00:28:33,218
Because?

381
00:28:33,392 --> 00:28:35,758
No. No, no. Don't tell me.

382
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:39,363
I'm not ready to take on
anything that I can't handle.

383
00:28:39,531 --> 00:28:42,295
No, you know what?
I know exactly how to handle this.

384
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:44,731
I'll treat myself
like a company in trouble.

385
00:28:44,903 --> 00:28:49,067
What I think is you are just indulging
in a lot of neuroses.

386
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:52,176
You take on too much,
it becomes about how much...

387
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:55,211
...instead of how well you handle it.
That applies now.

388
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,574
- Stand still!
- No.

389
00:28:56,748 --> 00:28:59,308
You do not have the luxury
of not hearing this.

390
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:01,918
Are you making me literally run
from bad news?

391
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:04,817
The chickenshit board has dec...

392
00:29:10,695 --> 00:29:12,128
I gotta go. I have a date.

393
00:29:12,297 --> 00:29:14,231
What happened to you was horrific.

394
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:17,160
- Stop acting tough.
- It's the worst move!

395
00:29:17,335 --> 00:29:18,632
Look at the time.

396
00:29:18,804 --> 00:29:21,932
Hey, everybody, I have to leave.
I have a date.

397
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:23,699
- What?
- Now, Lise?

398
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,604
- Yeah.
- Lisa?

399
00:29:25,911 --> 00:29:27,037
Nobody's buying this.

400
00:29:27,212 --> 00:29:30,079
- We should protest!
- We should.

401
00:29:30,449 --> 00:29:32,440
Smalls, what do you want us to do?

402
00:29:32,617 --> 00:29:36,144
- Lisa.
- Okay. There is one thing.

403
00:29:36,321 --> 00:29:40,382
When I come to visit you at training
camp when you're getting ready...

404
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,153
...just don't feel funny talking to me.

405
00:29:43,328 --> 00:29:46,786
Okay? Don't feel sad for me.

406
00:29:46,965 --> 00:29:50,765
Because my biggest fear is that
you won't be yourselves around me.

407
00:29:50,936 --> 00:29:54,770
I've seen that, and if that happened,
it would just make me feel like l...

408
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,067
Like I didn't know you anymore.

409
00:29:57,242 --> 00:29:59,574
And I want to.

410
00:29:59,744 --> 00:30:01,871
I need to.

411
00:30:03,348 --> 00:30:05,009
Just say, "Okay, Lisa."

412
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,477
Okay, Lisa.

413
00:30:07,986 --> 00:30:10,284
God. L...

414
00:30:10,455 --> 00:30:14,983
I gotta go. I gotta go.
He's waiting for me.

415
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,094
- I love you.
- Love you. Love you.

416
00:30:17,262 --> 00:30:19,321
- Love you too.
- Go, Lise.

417
00:30:19,498 --> 00:30:21,557
- Go, Lise.
- Lise!

418
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:35,346
- Hi.
- Name, please.

419
00:30:35,514 --> 00:30:37,209
I'm meeting George...

420
00:30:37,382 --> 00:30:40,943
- Madison?
- I'm not sure. I forget.

421
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:49,316
Could that be him over there?

422
00:30:50,762 --> 00:30:52,491
I'll bet that is him.

423
00:30:53,031 --> 00:30:55,329
That's the sort of day I'm having.

424
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:59,231
You don't have to take me.
Thank you, though.

425
00:31:06,077 --> 00:31:07,544
George?

426
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:10,080
Are you George?

427
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:12,774
I'm Lisa.

428
00:31:12,951 --> 00:31:15,749
- Very good of you to join me.
- Yeah.

429
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:18,845
How you doing?

430
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:21,786
How are you doing?

431
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:24,219
I'm great.

432
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:25,988
- Yeah?
- Yep.

433
00:31:26,164 --> 00:31:28,598
Well, treasure it.

434
00:31:31,403 --> 00:31:32,461
You okay?

435
00:31:32,637 --> 00:31:35,936
No. I'm sorry,
I'm not even aware that...

436
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:41,070
I have to apologize. This might not
be the best first impression.

437
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:43,476
I... I had...

438
00:31:45,183 --> 00:31:47,674
...an unusual 24 hours.

439
00:31:47,852 --> 00:31:51,413
Okay. Well, the bad days
make the good ones better.

440
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,114
So don't worry about it.

441
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,057
Is this an Italian restaurant?

442
00:31:57,229 --> 00:31:58,958
Yes, it's a very good one.

443
00:31:59,364 --> 00:32:00,626
Oh, yeah, it looks good.

444
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:03,490
- Let's get a drink.
- None for me.

445
00:32:03,668 --> 00:32:07,195
You know what? You're right.
Yeah. I shouldn't drink.

446
00:32:07,372 --> 00:32:09,272
- Don't let me stop you.
- No, no, no.

447
00:32:09,441 --> 00:32:13,400
Believe me, drinking too much
two nights in a row could be a mistake.

448
00:32:15,814 --> 00:32:19,272
I haven't had anything since
lunch yesterday, so I'm starving.

449
00:32:20,452 --> 00:32:21,680
You don't drink at all?

450
00:32:21,853 --> 00:32:24,788
- I follow my father's rule on drinking.
- Which is?

451
00:32:24,956 --> 00:32:28,323
Never drink to feel better.
Only drink to feel even better.

452
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:30,922
That's fantastic.

453
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:32,920
Yep. It's a good one.

454
00:32:33,098 --> 00:32:36,124
That's great.
But sometimes I think that...

455
00:32:36,301 --> 00:32:39,361
...one drink can give you
a little better perspective.

456
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:42,671
Not for me.
I guess it depends on the person.

457
00:32:42,841 --> 00:32:47,244
Look, if you wanna have a drink,
have a drink. Keeping talking about it...

458
00:32:47,412 --> 00:32:50,973
I don't need permission to drink.
If I want a drink, I'll order one.

459
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:53,982
Jesus! Do you know
I don't know you?

460
00:32:54,252 --> 00:32:57,187
I'm sorry. I'm not good today.

461
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:02,220
Maybe I should say what's going on.
I never talk about myself. I should.

462
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:05,691
No! Don't do that.

463
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:10,334
George, this is what I'm suggesting.
That we eat.

464
00:33:11,102 --> 00:33:14,299
And that we don't work
at this conversation.

465
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:16,633
- Let's just cut ourselves a break...
- Yes.

466
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:20,300
...and give ourselves permission
to be quiet.

467
00:33:20,478 --> 00:33:24,039
For the whole dinner.
Completely quiet.

468
00:33:26,418 --> 00:33:28,147
Can I talk to the waiter?

469
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:32,815
As long as you don't tell him
about your day.

470
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:36,545
I mean, that...

471
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:41,052
That was just what I needed.

472
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:44,986
You take care of yourself.

473
00:34:50,368 --> 00:34:53,098
I'm just leaving my place
to go to dinner.

474
00:34:53,271 --> 00:34:56,468
- Good evening, Mr. Madison. Taxi?
- Yes, thank you, Tom.

475
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:59,804
Okay, Dad, I'm ready.
What happened?

476
00:34:59,978 --> 00:35:02,674
What if I come by later?
The phone isn't...

477
00:35:03,415 --> 00:35:07,511
Just tell me. I'd rather use the rest of
the night processing the information.

478
00:35:10,355 --> 00:35:16,021
I'm sorry, this is private.
There's still some privacy left.

479
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:20,860
The board is refusing to pay...

480
00:35:21,032 --> 00:35:23,865
...your legal bills. Now...
- Hey.

481
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:27,933
I think I met a great girl.

482
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,776
Oh, good. There is a God.

483
00:35:50,028 --> 00:35:52,997
The girls needed to tell you
how they felt.

484
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:54,495
It's something, isn't it?

485
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:57,925
Last time I saw that was
when a kid died in high school...

486
00:35:58,102 --> 00:36:00,297
...and they left this stuff by the road.

487
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:01,734
How about straight talk?

488
00:36:01,906 --> 00:36:04,807
I am very sensitive
to what you're going through.

489
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:07,303
You know what you need most
right now?

490
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:09,171
- Yes.
- What?

491
00:36:09,547 --> 00:36:11,344
Insensitivity.

492
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:15,843
Yeah?

493
00:36:16,955 --> 00:36:19,549
- Who is it?
- It's Lisa.

494
00:36:19,724 --> 00:36:21,385
Could you narrow it down?

495
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:23,860
I'm not kidding right now.

496
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:28,088
A good Lisa. Come here. Get in.

497
00:36:32,136 --> 00:36:34,331
- You're alone, right?
- Yeah.

498
00:36:34,606 --> 00:36:37,074
I was just working up the night.

499
00:36:37,942 --> 00:36:39,307
Do you want me to be here?

500
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:43,008
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

501
00:36:43,181 --> 00:36:45,206
Then this is what I need.

502
00:36:45,383 --> 00:36:48,682
If in the middle of the night
I start crying or...

503
00:36:48,853 --> 00:36:53,586
...shaking or acting enormously upset,
I don't want you to ask what's wrong.

504
00:36:53,758 --> 00:36:56,955
I want you to just ignore it.
Is that okay with you?

505
00:36:57,962 --> 00:37:00,556
- Actually, that's my preference.
- Okay, good.

506
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:05,532
Have a seat. My game's coming up.

507
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:17,413
Matty Reynolds gets him.
The Nationals win.

508
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:19,846
- Good mechanics.
- Yeah.

509
00:37:29,193 --> 00:37:31,957
Okay. Let's go, I got it.

510
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:47,008
Can you afford me?

511
00:37:47,946 --> 00:37:52,781
The firm is refusing to pay my legal
bills, but my father is willing to help.

512
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:56,409
You can't take money from him,
not with his position on the board.

513
00:37:56,888 --> 00:37:58,515
What would your retainer be?

514
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:04,328
Three hundred thousand, and another
three in escrow in case it goes to trial.

515
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:11,597
- I suppose I could sell...
- Everything you can.

516
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,528
Okay.

517
00:38:19,243 --> 00:38:21,370
- Sit down.
- I don't wanna lie down.

518
00:38:21,846 --> 00:38:24,144
- I said, "Sit down."
- I don't think you did.

519
00:38:24,315 --> 00:38:27,648
Yes, I did. I never ask someone
to lie down on a first visit.

520
00:38:28,786 --> 00:38:30,720
- Sorry.
- Okay.

521
00:38:37,328 --> 00:38:38,795
So...

522
00:38:40,465 --> 00:38:41,693
...why are you here?

523
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:46,125
I have a month left on my insurance
and they pay up to six visits.

524
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:49,532
I meant, is there a difficulty?

525
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:52,733
Well...

526
00:38:55,113 --> 00:38:58,640
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go
because this is just stupid.

527
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,841
Not that this is stupid. But I mean...

528
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:04,682
Thank you for your time. Just for me,
you know. I mean, not this.

529
00:39:04,856 --> 00:39:07,188
- But thank you for understanding.
- All right.

530
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:09,349
- Okay.
- Okay.

531
00:39:10,428 --> 00:39:13,420
You know, can I ask you
just one stupid question?

532
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:15,589
No such thing.

533
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:19,134
Because I'm leaving
and I'm not gonna do this again.

534
00:39:19,804 --> 00:39:23,968
I was wondering if there's one general
thing you've found over the years...

535
00:39:24,142 --> 00:39:26,372
...to be generally true...

536
00:39:26,544 --> 00:39:30,446
...in a general way
that would help anyone...

537
00:39:31,149 --> 00:39:32,776
...with any situation?

538
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,975
That's a great question.

539
00:39:35,653 --> 00:39:37,211
Yes.

540
00:39:37,388 --> 00:39:41,848
I'd say, figure out what you want
and learn how to ask for it.

541
00:39:43,394 --> 00:39:44,986
Okay.

542
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:53,530
Those are both really hard.

543
00:39:55,073 --> 00:39:59,271
Yes, but you came here,
which was hard for you.

544
00:39:59,444 --> 00:40:01,776
And you're leaving right away,
also hard.

545
00:40:01,946 --> 00:40:06,042
So you're tougher than
you think you are right now.

546
00:40:07,518 --> 00:40:09,008
Thanks.

547
00:40:09,454 --> 00:40:10,648
I appreciate that.

548
00:40:11,055 --> 00:40:13,615
- Good luck.
- Okay.

549
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:18,757
- I can see why people do this.
- Thanks.

550
00:40:41,552 --> 00:40:44,680
I'm sorry. I thought some of them
were bringing their wives.

551
00:40:44,856 --> 00:40:48,690
That usually changes
the behavior considerably.

552
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,956
The rookie who lives here had this,
maybe the best barbecue anywhere...

553
00:40:53,131 --> 00:40:54,689
...flown in from Houston.

554
00:40:54,866 --> 00:40:58,131
He bought a first-class seat
so his friend could fly it in.

555
00:40:58,302 --> 00:41:01,760
Wait till you taste it. Try the sauce
first. That's how you judge.

556
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:05,272
- This place nails it. And you know...
- No hard feelings.

557
00:41:06,477 --> 00:41:10,038
You can stay, I just...
I can't do this right now.

558
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,017
There's Christian athletes inside.
We'll eat with them.

559
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,115
Do you ever wonder what's going on
in my life? Because you never ask.

560
00:41:19,624 --> 00:41:22,957
I thought I wasn't supposed to.
Is that just at night?

561
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:27,422
This is... You know what?
What I think I mean is...

562
00:41:27,598 --> 00:41:29,998
...I should tell you
what's going on with me.

563
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:37,499
I got...

564
00:41:39,076 --> 00:41:41,169
Oh, God.

565
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:43,046
I got cut.

566
00:41:43,681 --> 00:41:45,114
Sorry.

567
00:41:45,283 --> 00:41:49,276
Let's have some barbecue
and we'll talk about it. That's...

568
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:52,052
I don't wanna eat now.

569
00:41:53,024 --> 00:41:54,753
I can't.

570
00:41:56,127 --> 00:41:57,992
You don't wanna eat anything?

571
00:41:58,162 --> 00:41:59,390
I just can't.

572
00:42:00,331 --> 00:42:01,923
Well...

573
00:42:04,836 --> 00:42:06,303
Okay.

574
00:42:07,238 --> 00:42:08,262
I'll go with you.

575
00:42:09,207 --> 00:42:10,231
Okay.

576
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:27,758
So I'm gonna go
to grad school at night.

577
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:31,793
I'll have to work a few jobs, but
I've got the private coaching thing...

578
00:42:31,963 --> 00:42:34,397
...and I lined up
this part-time retail thing.

579
00:42:34,565 --> 00:42:37,090
- That's great.
- That's good. I got that covered.

580
00:42:37,268 --> 00:42:39,532
I just have this problem
with my attitude.

581
00:42:39,704 --> 00:42:44,903
It's like I have to get to the place where
I appreciate what the game gave me.

582
00:42:45,076 --> 00:42:49,479
And accept and even embrace
the obvious...

583
00:42:49,647 --> 00:42:52,343
...that the time comes
for every athlete when they...

584
00:42:52,516 --> 00:42:54,245
It's never gonna come for me.

585
00:42:57,121 --> 00:42:59,112
You know what?
Maybe we shouldn't talk.

586
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:01,258
Maybe we should watch TV
or something.

587
00:43:01,425 --> 00:43:04,986
No, no, no. Hold on, come here.

588
00:43:07,365 --> 00:43:09,094
I hear everything you're saying.

589
00:43:09,267 --> 00:43:14,330
Come sit over here. I'm gonna set you
down and make you something to eat.

590
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:18,134
We get a little food in your stomach,
we'll both think better.

591
00:43:18,609 --> 00:43:21,373
You like inspirational stories?

592
00:43:21,545 --> 00:43:23,740
Okay, I got one for you.

593
00:43:23,915 --> 00:43:26,975
I knew a really good player once,
and the coach cut him.

594
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:30,744
And the guy just felt...
He felt impotent.

595
00:43:30,922 --> 00:43:35,655
Now you're probably feeling whatever
the female version of that word is.

596
00:43:35,826 --> 00:43:36,850
It's the same word.

597
00:43:38,596 --> 00:43:41,929
Don't let what's going on with you
make you give me a hard time.

598
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:43,896
Because that's not productive.

599
00:43:44,068 --> 00:43:46,332
I'm not.
It's the same word for women.

600
00:43:46,504 --> 00:43:48,404
"Impotent"?

601
00:43:51,842 --> 00:43:54,242
Okay. Tie goes to the pretty one.

602
00:43:54,412 --> 00:43:58,041
Same word. He was feeling impotent,
just like you may be feeling.

603
00:43:58,215 --> 00:44:00,274
I don't think that's how I feel...

604
00:44:00,451 --> 00:44:01,816
Can I finish my thought?

605
00:44:01,986 --> 00:44:05,888
Maybe it'll help, maybe it won't,
but I'm trying.

606
00:44:07,058 --> 00:44:08,286
I'm sorry.

607
00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:10,188
- That's all right.
- Go ahead.

608
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:15,230
Okay. So his girlfriend had a cat
and he started to save the cat's shit...

609
00:44:15,766 --> 00:44:18,428
- A little trust.
- Okay.

610
00:44:19,537 --> 00:44:24,167
He started to save all the cat's shit,
and every few days or so...

611
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:29,209
...he'd take a little amount and wrap it
in a different package, like a gift...

612
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,178
...or a magazine roll
or something you order online.

613
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:34,318
Every few days for eight months...

614
00:44:34,485 --> 00:44:37,682
...he would send these cat turds
to the guy who cut him.

615
00:44:44,095 --> 00:44:45,653
Is that it?

616
00:44:47,064 --> 00:44:49,191
Yeah, that's it. It's a great story.

617
00:44:49,367 --> 00:44:51,995
Did you understand it was the coach
he sent it to?

618
00:44:52,169 --> 00:44:56,299
To the guy who cut him?
He felt impotent, and then he...

619
00:44:56,474 --> 00:44:58,601
File it away. It worked for this guy.

620
00:45:01,278 --> 00:45:04,213
No, so he stopped
when his anger went away...

621
00:45:04,382 --> 00:45:05,815
Yeah. Yeah.

622
00:45:05,983 --> 00:45:07,541
Well, the cat died.

623
00:45:09,887 --> 00:45:11,354
Oh, God.

624
00:45:11,522 --> 00:45:14,252
There, a smile.

625
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:19,028
That's horrible.
I didn't know the cat was gonna die.

626
00:45:19,196 --> 00:45:20,390
You feel better.

627
00:45:20,564 --> 00:45:24,830
Great. I hated seeing you
touch bottom.

628
00:45:30,307 --> 00:45:31,535
That was sweet.

629
00:45:34,879 --> 00:45:36,904
Yeah, you're right.

630
00:45:39,884 --> 00:45:41,613
It's okay.

631
00:45:52,797 --> 00:45:55,960
- You are amazing.
- You were great.

632
00:45:56,133 --> 00:45:59,364
- It takes two, you know?
- At least.

633
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,001
Creep.

634
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:05,634
Oh, boy.

635
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,373
You clap to bring on the lights
the minute we finish?

636
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:11,344
Why? What's the matter?

637
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:16,076
Just clapping your hands and
those dumb lights makes me feel like...

638
00:46:16,253 --> 00:46:19,780
Wait, wait, let me guess.
I think I can get it.

639
00:46:20,091 --> 00:46:22,457
Like I'm not thinking about you.

640
00:46:23,094 --> 00:46:24,721
Look who got it.

641
00:46:24,895 --> 00:46:27,921
- Yeah, look who read your mind.
- God.

642
00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:30,067
Yeah. What should I do?

643
00:46:31,135 --> 00:46:33,501
God. Turn them off!

644
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:37,673
You wanna do it? Come on.
Oh, it's fun.

645
00:46:38,876 --> 00:46:40,639
Grow up.

646
00:46:41,112 --> 00:46:42,511
No.

647
00:46:47,518 --> 00:46:50,282
It was kind of fun, wasn't it?

648
00:46:51,155 --> 00:46:53,851
I'm gonna teach you
how to have fun.

649
00:47:12,877 --> 00:47:14,401
- You didn't see that?
- What?

650
00:47:15,513 --> 00:47:18,744
Let me ask you something.
How do you know when you're in love?

651
00:47:20,217 --> 00:47:22,981
- Intriguing.
- Ryan. Get loose.

652
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,687
Well...

653
00:47:27,191 --> 00:47:29,853
- What?
- I got a way.

654
00:47:30,027 --> 00:47:33,190
Whenever this one thing happens,
I know I'm done.

655
00:47:34,665 --> 00:47:37,361
It's personal. I don't want
anyone making fun of me.

656
00:47:37,535 --> 00:47:39,560
No, no one's... Go!

657
00:47:42,773 --> 00:47:46,675
I'm in love with somebody when
I wear a condom with the other girls.

658
00:47:49,547 --> 00:47:52,243
Holy shit, I'm in love.

659
00:48:06,197 --> 00:48:07,221
Hello?

660
00:48:07,565 --> 00:48:09,465
You up for a crazy idea?

661
00:48:09,633 --> 00:48:10,793
Yes.

662
00:48:10,968 --> 00:48:13,493
Maybe it'd be fun if you
kind of move in with me.

663
00:48:15,372 --> 00:48:16,703
Hello? Are you there?

664
00:48:16,874 --> 00:48:18,535
Barely.

665
00:48:19,743 --> 00:48:22,075
- Are you serious?
- I know.

666
00:48:22,546 --> 00:48:24,605
I told you it was crazy.

667
00:48:24,782 --> 00:48:27,114
Can you give me a minute
to form a thought?

668
00:48:27,284 --> 00:48:30,082
- Yeah, yeah. Take your time.
- Okay. Thanks.

669
00:48:30,254 --> 00:48:31,585
Okay, I'll call you back.

670
00:48:43,801 --> 00:48:45,132
That was quick.

671
00:48:45,302 --> 00:48:49,204
I know, but, Lisa, listen.
Today I caught myself...

672
00:48:49,373 --> 00:48:50,431
Thanks, Bobby.

673
00:48:51,842 --> 00:48:55,300
Today I caught myself wishing
you were in the bullpen with me.

674
00:48:55,479 --> 00:48:59,074
Literally having a daydream.
I mean, that's serious.

675
00:49:01,085 --> 00:49:02,848
Li... Are you there?

676
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,318
Hello? What are you doing?

677
00:49:05,723 --> 00:49:06,815
I think I'm thinking.

678
00:49:06,991 --> 00:49:10,256
Don't! You shouldn't have to think
about a great idea.

679
00:49:10,427 --> 00:49:12,361
You said this was a crazy idea.

680
00:49:12,529 --> 00:49:16,932
I know, I think it's both. I think part of
the greatness is how crazy it is.

681
00:49:17,101 --> 00:49:18,830
What first popped into your mind?

682
00:49:19,903 --> 00:49:23,031
That I don't know what to say
and it makes me feel stupid.

683
00:49:23,207 --> 00:49:24,333
Second thing.

684
00:49:24,508 --> 00:49:26,635
That I've never lived
with anyone before.

685
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:29,540
Great. No one's had a chance
to ruin you.

686
00:49:31,315 --> 00:49:33,044
Have you ever lived with anybody?

687
00:49:33,217 --> 00:49:36,618
With me you get into what does
"living together" mean...

688
00:49:36,787 --> 00:49:38,379
...and duration is a factor.

689
00:49:38,555 --> 00:49:40,716
But listen, is...? Do you think...

690
00:49:40,891 --> 00:49:43,951
...this is something?
Do you wanna do this?

691
00:49:46,196 --> 00:49:48,494
- Hello?
- I honestly...

692
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:51,066
- Yeah?
- I don't know how to figure this out.

693
00:49:51,635 --> 00:49:53,899
Is there tingling?
Do you have goose bumps?

694
00:49:54,071 --> 00:49:57,302
Maybe I need to work my voice
a little bit until you get them.

695
00:49:59,143 --> 00:50:00,405
I think I just got them.

696
00:50:02,046 --> 00:50:03,343
What?

697
00:50:03,614 --> 00:50:06,242
- I think I just got them.
- Yeah.

698
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:08,044
I really like you, Matty.

699
00:50:08,252 --> 00:50:09,844
Okay.

700
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:13,546
- Good phone call.
- Good phone call.

701
00:50:13,724 --> 00:50:15,817
- Right? Yeah.
- Thank you.

702
00:50:22,232 --> 00:50:24,223
This is such a mistake.

703
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:27,700
- Overstepping alert.
- You sublet your apartment.

704
00:50:27,871 --> 00:50:32,109
You told me don't do anything halfway
unless you're willing to be half happy.

705
00:50:32,176 --> 00:50:36,044
Don't make important life decisions
when you are mush. It's too dangerous.

706
00:50:36,213 --> 00:50:38,773
Fight low self-esteem,
don't give it the wheel.

707
00:50:38,949 --> 00:50:42,282
I am packed here. I am doing this.

708
00:50:42,453 --> 00:50:47,015
So back off, or do what you always do
for me, pull out some damn positives.

709
00:50:52,696 --> 00:50:54,254
I'm sorry, honey.

710
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:57,099
Positives.

711
00:50:57,267 --> 00:51:00,703
Hell, the guy has
a 94-mile-an-hour fastball.

712
00:51:00,871 --> 00:51:03,704
He makes 14 million a year.
Go get him.

713
00:51:05,576 --> 00:51:08,374
- Got your bag? I cleared some space.
- Yeah, I just...

714
00:51:11,215 --> 00:51:13,150
- Yeah, come on in.
- Okay.

715
00:51:17,187 --> 00:51:20,122
Okay, I can get rid of
both of these things right here.

716
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:23,589
I'll talk to the guys downstairs.
They have storage space.

717
00:51:23,761 --> 00:51:25,285
It's okay.

718
00:51:25,729 --> 00:51:27,356
We'll make it work.

719
00:51:34,071 --> 00:51:35,504
Hey, boss, it's me.

720
00:51:44,081 --> 00:51:46,242
- Annie.
- Hi. Did you call that girl?

721
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:51,753
No. You don't have to bring me food.
It's enough that you found this place.

722
00:51:51,922 --> 00:51:55,323
That was selfish. You dress up
my neighborhood. Love your window?

723
00:51:55,492 --> 00:51:56,652
It's great.

724
00:51:57,194 --> 00:51:58,218
This is...

725
00:51:58,395 --> 00:52:01,728
Cooking relaxes me when I can't
sleep. So why not just call her?

726
00:52:01,899 --> 00:52:04,561
Honestly? Because my
first impression wasn't great.

727
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:07,135
I'd rather be more myself
when I see her next.

728
00:52:07,304 --> 00:52:09,795
What if someone beats you to her?

729
00:52:09,973 --> 00:52:12,874
Optimism is sanity for me right now.

730
00:52:14,044 --> 00:52:16,444
Please, sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

731
00:52:16,613 --> 00:52:18,205
Relax.

732
00:52:20,918 --> 00:52:21,942
Look.

733
00:52:26,323 --> 00:52:27,847
I'm in a funny position...

734
00:52:28,025 --> 00:52:31,620
...but I know stuff about
what happened at work.

735
00:52:31,795 --> 00:52:34,525
I can't tell you
because of that thing I signed...

736
00:52:34,698 --> 00:52:39,897
...but if you start guessing, I can't help
it if this face is an open book. Look!

737
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:44,302
Stop. You'd get in trouble, and just
listening could be wrongdoing for me.

738
00:52:44,475 --> 00:52:46,170
This information is killing me!

739
00:52:46,343 --> 00:52:49,642
It's like I know someone is gonna
shoot you and I can't scream:

740
00:52:49,813 --> 00:52:53,977
"Watch out! That man's gonna
blow your frigging head off!"

741
00:52:54,151 --> 00:52:57,052
Please play this game with me,
or I'll just tell you!

742
00:52:57,221 --> 00:52:59,189
- No!
- For God's sake, let me unburden!

743
00:52:59,356 --> 00:53:03,190
Stop! Stop!
Annie, sit down, please. Sit down.

744
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,421
Careful. You have to understand
what this is like for me right now.

745
00:53:07,931 --> 00:53:12,868
Picture a very angry ocean. A storm.
And I'm on this little tiny boat.

746
00:53:13,036 --> 00:53:16,096
And miraculously,
this boat is still afloat.

747
00:53:16,273 --> 00:53:19,140
And that boat is that
I haven't done anything wrong.

748
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:23,177
Like letting you say something you're
legally constrained from revealing.

749
00:53:23,347 --> 00:53:27,249
Not doing anything wrong is
what's keeping me afloat. All right?

750
00:53:27,417 --> 00:53:29,612
If I lose that, I'm gone.

751
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:34,216
Don't rock the boat.

752
00:53:34,391 --> 00:53:36,359
- I know about the boat.
- Stop!

753
00:53:36,527 --> 00:53:40,190
- It's a terrible boat! Get out of the boat!
- Respect me on this!

754
00:53:40,497 --> 00:53:42,590
For what it's worth, it doesn't matter.

755
00:53:44,635 --> 00:53:47,763
I think I've guessed
the same stuff you know.

756
00:53:48,605 --> 00:53:50,095
I think I know what you do.

757
00:54:06,924 --> 00:54:08,448
Nope.

758
00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:12,428
You couldn't function if you knew
what I'm talking about.

759
00:54:12,596 --> 00:54:14,689
Oh, I think I could.

760
00:54:15,866 --> 00:54:17,060
I think I am.

761
00:54:18,502 --> 00:54:20,493
- Leave it.
- What if I give you a hint?

762
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:24,971
No, don't! Don't make me
leave my own apartment. Please.

763
00:54:32,716 --> 00:54:34,809
Okay. Eat something.

764
00:54:36,286 --> 00:54:37,776
Thank you.

765
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:41,280
The lasagna looks amazing,
by the way.

766
00:54:48,332 --> 00:54:51,199
- Hello, Dad.
- Are you coming to my place?

767
00:54:51,668 --> 00:54:53,568
- Almost there.
- Good.

768
00:54:53,737 --> 00:54:57,002
I have some disturbing news.

769
00:54:57,174 --> 00:54:59,335
- What?
- I'll wait till you get here.

770
00:54:59,509 --> 00:55:02,444
Tell me. It'd be nice to get
one piece of bad news...

771
00:55:02,613 --> 00:55:05,309
...without someone studying me
to see how I take it.

772
00:55:05,582 --> 00:55:08,346
Anger can be useful.
Watch out for the bitterness.

773
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:09,845
What's the news, Dad?

774
00:55:13,557 --> 00:55:17,357
There are strong indications
that they are going to indict you.

775
00:55:17,794 --> 00:55:20,354
I have canceled
everything I've got...

776
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:23,658
...and I am dedicating myself
completely to this.

777
00:55:26,036 --> 00:55:27,435
George?

778
00:55:54,931 --> 00:55:56,489
George?

779
00:55:59,636 --> 00:56:01,263
Oh, God, please don't kid me.

780
00:56:01,772 --> 00:56:02,830
How are you?

781
00:56:04,408 --> 00:56:06,137
Really...

782
00:56:08,045 --> 00:56:10,513
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

783
00:56:11,248 --> 00:56:13,239
That's so funny.

784
00:56:19,256 --> 00:56:20,848
Thanks.

785
00:56:21,024 --> 00:56:23,185
- You didn't have to do that.
- Yeah, I did.

786
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,590
So do you live in this building?

787
00:56:27,297 --> 00:56:29,128
Did you leave?

788
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,397
Are you still here?

789
00:56:31,568 --> 00:56:32,626
Yeah. Absolutely.

790
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:36,061
- Here I am.
- Okay.

791
00:56:36,606 --> 00:56:39,097
Sorry I'm not more hospitable.
I'm in a hurry.

792
00:56:39,276 --> 00:56:42,609
Can I go first?
I want to explain why I haven't called.

793
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:45,878
I don't understand.

794
00:56:46,416 --> 00:56:50,978
I think I've made a bad assumption that
we've been on the same wavelength.

795
00:56:51,154 --> 00:56:54,055
That didn't come out right at all.
I didn't mean...

796
00:56:56,193 --> 00:56:58,559
I didn't quite mean to say that either.

797
00:56:58,929 --> 00:57:02,695
You ever wanna delete every sentence
you say, even as you say them?

798
00:57:02,866 --> 00:57:04,561
- No.
- No?

799
00:57:05,302 --> 00:57:09,005
You're funny. You know,
I'm really glad I ran into you.

800
00:57:09,072 --> 00:57:10,699
I bit your head off at dinner.

801
00:57:10,874 --> 00:57:14,742
I have this thing about rudeness,
so I'm glad I could say I'm sorry.

802
00:57:16,113 --> 00:57:17,137
- No...
- Lisa!

803
00:57:17,314 --> 00:57:20,112
Yeah! I'm in the kitchen!

804
00:57:21,585 --> 00:57:23,143
Hey, babe.

805
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,988
George, this is my boyfriend, Matty.

806
00:57:28,291 --> 00:57:29,952
Nice to meet you.

807
00:57:31,695 --> 00:57:33,925
- Who is he?
- You didn't even say hello.

808
00:57:34,097 --> 00:57:37,533
I think you should check with me
before inviting some guy over...

809
00:57:37,701 --> 00:57:40,898
...so I'm a little too pissed off
to just say hello.

810
00:57:43,206 --> 00:57:44,833
Can I talk to you?

811
00:57:54,017 --> 00:57:57,077
- Why would I check with you?
- Want me to state the obvious?

812
00:57:57,254 --> 00:58:01,588
I have to check with you before inviting
someone up who carried our groceries?

813
00:58:01,758 --> 00:58:05,216
I didn't know about the groceries.
Maybe that changes things.

814
00:58:05,462 --> 00:58:06,895
I think it does.

815
00:58:07,063 --> 00:58:08,655
- Good talk.
- Wait. No.

816
00:58:08,832 --> 00:58:10,800
What's this obvious thing
I'm missing?

817
00:58:10,967 --> 00:58:15,165
Let's forget it. Otherwise, you want
me to put my foot in the trap? Okay.

818
00:58:15,338 --> 00:58:18,865
There's no trap. But let's show up
here. What am I missing?

819
00:58:19,176 --> 00:58:21,508
Okay. That this is my place.

820
00:58:24,047 --> 00:58:26,515
This is my place.

821
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:29,147
Oh, boy.

822
00:58:32,722 --> 00:58:33,814
So long, Matty.

823
00:58:39,229 --> 00:58:40,890
Lisa, what are you doing?

824
00:58:41,064 --> 00:58:43,498
Congratulations,
you get your sock drawer back.

825
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:47,034
Lisa, you can't do this.
We have a guest.

826
00:58:48,338 --> 00:58:51,501
Okay, you can have people over.
Without asking.

827
00:58:51,675 --> 00:58:53,870
You won't abuse the privilege. Right?

828
00:58:54,044 --> 00:58:57,571
There's also the safety issue,
which everyone's ignoring.

829
00:58:57,747 --> 00:58:58,873
Can you get the door?

830
00:59:11,695 --> 00:59:13,287
I think I screwed up.

831
00:59:13,463 --> 00:59:14,760
Not from my perspective.

832
00:59:14,931 --> 00:59:16,523
Yeah, thanks, buddy.

833
00:59:28,678 --> 00:59:30,111
Thanks.

834
00:59:31,882 --> 00:59:33,975
- Taxi?
- No, thanks, Tom.

835
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:38,780
I just have to figure out
where I'm going.

836
00:59:46,496 --> 00:59:48,464
- Hey.
- Hey.

837
00:59:48,632 --> 00:59:51,328
Do you live around here?
I need to charge my phone.

838
00:59:51,501 --> 00:59:53,230
Yeah, I live pretty close.

839
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:56,132
About an hour. By bus.

840
00:59:56,306 --> 00:59:57,671
I don't wanna mislead you.

841
00:59:58,208 --> 01:00:01,143
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.

842
01:00:02,045 --> 01:00:04,605
- Here.
- Thanks.

843
01:00:04,781 --> 01:00:06,749
- I'll take it. I got it.
- Thanks.

844
01:00:08,251 --> 01:00:10,583
It's an hour 10, maybe.

845
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,193
Hello, sir.

846
01:00:18,361 --> 01:00:20,591
Yes, she just came down.

847
01:00:20,764 --> 01:00:22,595
Okay, I'll try.

848
01:00:39,182 --> 01:00:42,549
Sorry, sir, I just wasn't able
to contact her for you.

849
01:00:59,035 --> 01:01:01,833
Man, so dead.

850
01:01:02,005 --> 01:01:05,202
It's a new place.
I haven't totally unpacked yet.

851
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:08,469
- Are you hungry?
- Lately? Always.

852
01:01:08,645 --> 01:01:10,510
Why are you asking?
You got nibbles?

853
01:01:10,714 --> 01:01:13,979
Oh, yes. Do you wanna hear a list?

854
01:01:17,287 --> 01:01:18,686
Lisa?

855
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:23,653
I'm sorry, did you say something?
I was distracted.

856
01:01:23,827 --> 01:01:27,228
So was I. You wanna hear
a list of what I've got?

857
01:01:28,064 --> 01:01:31,090
- I'm not gonna be great company.
- Are you kidding me?

858
01:01:31,267 --> 01:01:35,499
This is the best conversation I've had
since the night we didn't talk.

859
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:39,568
- Well, that's sort of funny.
- Flying start.

860
01:01:39,943 --> 01:01:42,173
Hey, what can I do to help?

861
01:01:48,118 --> 01:01:49,517
You make your own pot pie?

862
01:01:49,686 --> 01:01:54,180
A friend. Plates and silverware
are over here.

863
01:02:06,036 --> 01:02:07,867
Hello?

864
01:02:08,038 --> 01:02:10,529
It doesn't matter where I am.

865
01:02:11,574 --> 01:02:12,871
You're gonna yell at me?

866
01:02:13,043 --> 01:02:16,171
That's it? That's why you called?
You know what I thin...

867
01:02:16,346 --> 01:02:17,779
Wait.

868
01:02:18,415 --> 01:02:20,576
You're gonna lose me.

869
01:02:24,254 --> 01:02:28,122
Just as well. It wasn't gonna
go well from there anyway.

870
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:30,384
I think we both need
some time to think.

871
01:02:33,196 --> 01:02:35,960
- Do you have any Guinness?
- I will get Guinness.

872
01:02:36,132 --> 01:02:38,032
- Don't go out of your way.
- No, no.

873
01:02:38,201 --> 01:02:42,160
I make a great drink, if you wanna
try it. It's not an idle remark, I do.

874
01:02:42,338 --> 01:02:45,796
Okay. I'll try something.
Just not too strong.

875
01:02:46,476 --> 01:02:47,909
What am I doing?

876
01:02:48,078 --> 01:02:53,038
Stay honest with yourself when making
a mistake, there might be a takeaway.

877
01:02:53,917 --> 01:02:57,512
I'm gonna get drunk because
I'm too lame to stand how I feel.

878
01:02:57,787 --> 01:02:59,084
Great choice.

879
01:02:59,255 --> 01:03:01,223
- Could you do me a favor?
- Absolutely.

880
01:03:01,391 --> 01:03:03,689
And thank you for the opportunity.

881
01:03:04,494 --> 01:03:07,827
Could you not?
I have a boyfriend, so could we just?

882
01:03:08,531 --> 01:03:10,158
- Yes.
- Really?

883
01:03:10,467 --> 01:03:12,025
Yes.

884
01:03:12,502 --> 01:03:15,096
I have a teammate,
or an ex-teammate...

885
01:03:15,271 --> 01:03:19,674
...who says the only time I say anything
is when I drink Guinness, so watch out.

886
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:26,947
Well, I think you've been saying a lot
without drinking.

887
01:03:27,117 --> 01:03:29,415
You are truly something.

888
01:03:29,886 --> 01:03:34,255
Which means my thinking about you
isn't just an aspect of the trouble I'm in.

889
01:03:34,424 --> 01:03:36,016
I don't follow you.

890
01:03:36,726 --> 01:03:38,694
- You're in some sort of trouble?
- No...

891
01:03:38,862 --> 01:03:42,161
First things first. I'll be right back.
Make yourself at home.

892
01:03:42,332 --> 01:03:43,765
Okay.

893
01:04:06,689 --> 01:04:08,054
Sorry.

894
01:04:11,394 --> 01:04:12,986
I got it!

895
01:04:13,897 --> 01:04:17,765
Okay, Lisa, if you're not back
in an hour, forget it. That's it.

896
01:04:17,934 --> 01:04:21,597
Okay, I'm removing the deadline.
Any time's good.

897
01:04:21,905 --> 01:04:23,167
L...

898
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:26,706
I may have contributed
to the misunderstanding.

899
01:04:26,876 --> 01:04:30,710
I mean, if you could see my face,
you'd see how upset I am.

900
01:04:31,214 --> 01:04:32,943
Hold on, I'm gonna...

901
01:04:43,059 --> 01:04:45,027
No, let me...

902
01:04:48,431 --> 01:04:50,865
Turn off the lights

903
01:04:52,302 --> 01:04:53,870
And light a candle

904
01:05:05,548 --> 01:05:07,709
Let's take a shower

905
01:05:08,985 --> 01:05:11,249
Shower together

906
01:05:12,889 --> 01:05:15,380
I'll wash your body

907
01:05:15,592 --> 01:05:18,152
You wash mine, yeah

908
01:05:19,362 --> 01:05:23,958
Rub me down
With some hot oils, baby

909
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,809
All right. I hope I haven't
built this up too much.

910
01:05:37,513 --> 01:05:40,846
- Okay. Tell me what you think.
- Oh, good.

911
01:05:45,588 --> 01:05:46,612
It's good, right?

912
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:49,121
- It's delicious.
- Thanks. My own creation.

913
01:05:49,292 --> 01:05:53,752
I used to be a bartender, when I was
working my way through bartending.

914
01:05:56,599 --> 01:05:58,590
Oh, here. Please.

915
01:05:59,102 --> 01:06:02,094
Come here.
To people who make toasts.

916
01:06:03,606 --> 01:06:05,437
I just touched your leg.

917
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:07,300
I know.

918
01:06:08,678 --> 01:06:11,169
So my father would rather
I was more...

919
01:06:12,715 --> 01:06:14,512
...dynamic. Okay?

920
01:06:15,285 --> 01:06:19,619
He raised me since I was 7 because...
And wait till you hear this.

921
01:06:19,822 --> 01:06:21,790
People go crazy over it.

922
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:24,791
I'm serious, be prepared
to see me through new eyes.

923
01:06:25,061 --> 01:06:26,722
- Okay.
- I become...

924
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:29,727
...dangerously appealing.

925
01:06:29,899 --> 01:06:32,060
Yeah. You'll wanna sit up
for this one.

926
01:06:32,235 --> 01:06:34,703
- Okay.
- Here I go. Okay.

927
01:06:39,075 --> 01:06:40,406
My mother left us...

928
01:06:40,576 --> 01:06:44,034
...after seeing Kramer vs. Kramer
at the movies one afternoon.

929
01:06:46,282 --> 01:06:48,477
- Do you know the picture?
- No.

930
01:06:48,951 --> 01:06:52,478
It's a movie about a woman who
leaves Dustin Hoffman and her son...

931
01:06:52,655 --> 01:06:54,919
...because she had to
find out who she was.

932
01:06:55,258 --> 01:06:56,657
That's strange.

933
01:06:56,826 --> 01:06:59,590
She came back. In the movie.

934
01:07:02,498 --> 01:07:05,956
I have to make those old "sucking
it up" lessons work for me now.

935
01:07:06,135 --> 01:07:09,002
Like when we lost
the NCAA championship by one run.

936
01:07:09,172 --> 01:07:13,302
And instead of having some
self-pitying, self-indulgent...

937
01:07:13,476 --> 01:07:18,140
...Kleenex party, we did a little good.
There were these kids there, and...

938
01:07:18,348 --> 01:07:20,748
- Are you bored?
- Transfixed.

939
01:07:21,584 --> 01:07:24,678
Cut it out.
I don't understand what you're doing.

940
01:07:24,854 --> 01:07:26,754
These cannot be moves.

941
01:07:28,257 --> 01:07:30,725
Do I sound like
I'm feeling sorry for myself?

942
01:07:30,893 --> 01:07:33,384
Go ahead. No, come on.
You were saying?

943
01:07:36,332 --> 01:07:39,699
Most of the girls I play with,
when they're done playing...

944
01:07:39,869 --> 01:07:44,329
...their plan is meet a guy,
love, have a baby...

945
01:07:45,141 --> 01:07:49,202
...go to grad school and get a job.
I mean, I'm doing those things...

946
01:07:49,379 --> 01:07:53,008
...but my problem,
my challenge is...

947
01:07:53,683 --> 01:07:55,674
- Oh, God, shut me up.
- No, no, no!

948
01:07:55,852 --> 01:07:58,184
You're saying exactly what
you need to say.

949
01:07:58,354 --> 01:08:00,982
Just let it out. Talk.
Otherwise, disease starts...

950
01:08:01,157 --> 01:08:02,818
Why don't you shut up too?

951
01:08:02,992 --> 01:08:05,961
What do you know, except
looking at me like you're Bambi?

952
01:08:06,129 --> 01:08:08,324
Have you ever seen that movie?

953
01:08:08,865 --> 01:08:11,629
Yeah. It's a wonderful film. I own it.

954
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:17,298
- Oh, jeez. I'm sorry.
- No.

955
01:08:17,473 --> 01:08:19,270
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

956
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:23,841
I bet you're glad you fed me
all those drinks.

957
01:08:26,449 --> 01:08:29,282
Your problem? Your challenge?

958
01:08:35,792 --> 01:08:39,592
I don't know if I have what it takes...

959
01:08:40,263 --> 01:08:42,959
...for everybody's regular plan.

960
01:08:46,436 --> 01:08:49,234
I've never felt, like, that love...

961
01:08:49,405 --> 01:08:53,603
...like the guy is
the whole deal, like... Like...

962
01:08:53,776 --> 01:08:57,576
To be honest, the baby thing?
Never. Never.

963
01:08:59,449 --> 01:09:01,815
I'm just good at this one thing,
you know?

964
01:09:01,984 --> 01:09:06,011
And when I hear girls talking about
how in love they are...

965
01:09:06,189 --> 01:09:09,124
...or how the baby is everything...

966
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,126
...I think they're pretending.

967
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:39,149
What sort of trouble are you in?

968
01:09:42,325 --> 01:09:45,852
Simply put,
I'm currently unemployed.

969
01:09:46,028 --> 01:09:48,496
My girlfriend recently
broke up with me.

970
01:09:48,664 --> 01:09:50,564
I'll soon run out of money.

971
01:09:50,733 --> 01:09:53,224
And I'm the target
of a federal investigation.

972
01:09:57,306 --> 01:09:59,900
Wow, you're a real chick magnet,
aren't you?

973
01:10:11,153 --> 01:10:12,950
I'm sorry.

974
01:10:13,122 --> 01:10:14,612
Well, we'll see.

975
01:10:15,758 --> 01:10:17,817
- What impresses me about...
- Know what...

976
01:10:17,994 --> 01:10:19,689
I'm sorry. Did I interrupt you?

977
01:10:19,862 --> 01:10:23,855
No, no. Please, go ahead. I didn't
mean to interrupt your train of thought.

978
01:10:24,033 --> 01:10:27,196
You... Pl... Go ahead.
What impresses you about me?

979
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:29,968
You haven't let anything
take your spirit.

980
01:10:30,139 --> 01:10:33,267
No. Not tonight.

981
01:10:35,044 --> 01:10:39,105
Tonight you've done me a great turn.
You've given me temporary amnesia.

982
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:42,106
- Get out of here.
- You have.

983
01:10:42,985 --> 01:10:47,422
I can't believe you tell me
all you just did, and then flirt with me.

984
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:49,382
Amazing.

985
01:10:53,396 --> 01:10:55,762
Why is the government?

986
01:10:56,566 --> 01:10:59,535
I don't know. Truly.

987
01:10:59,702 --> 01:11:01,067
I'm...

988
01:11:02,071 --> 01:11:03,339
...honest.

989
01:11:13,716 --> 01:11:14,740
Hey, Matty.

990
01:11:14,917 --> 01:11:18,114
Lisa. First of all, I'm not gonna
ask you where you've been.

991
01:11:18,287 --> 01:11:20,278
But I get points for that, right?

992
01:11:20,456 --> 01:11:22,185
Not when you put it like that.

993
01:11:22,358 --> 01:11:25,691
Okay, I screw up.
That's why I wrote something out...

994
01:11:25,861 --> 01:11:29,228
...that I wanna say to you. Okay.

995
01:11:29,498 --> 01:11:31,796
Okay, this will be good.

996
01:11:31,968 --> 01:11:33,333
Is it bad I wrote it out?

997
01:11:33,502 --> 01:11:37,097
It's unusual, not bad. Stop asking me
things like that. It's weird.

998
01:11:37,273 --> 01:11:40,538
Sorry. I went nuts when you left.
I broke a lamp.

999
01:11:41,811 --> 01:11:44,279
Okay, read me the thing.

1000
01:11:44,614 --> 01:11:46,104
That was the thing.

1001
01:11:50,019 --> 01:11:52,487
Well, then I'm deeply touched.

1002
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:54,117
You really broke a lamp?

1003
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:57,123
Yeah, I mean, I just smashed it.

1004
01:11:57,293 --> 01:11:59,227
It's destroyed. You should see it.

1005
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:05,360
Okay, what else do I do here?
Please come back!

1006
01:12:05,534 --> 01:12:08,662
That's... You know,
that's giant for me to say.

1007
01:12:08,838 --> 01:12:12,296
I don't know that I'll do great,
but I know I can do better.

1008
01:12:13,442 --> 01:12:16,138
Whoa, this is breakthrough stuff
for me here!

1009
01:12:17,213 --> 01:12:19,807
- Okay.
- Great. Okay.

1010
01:12:19,982 --> 01:12:22,007
- I'll see you soon.
- Bye. I'll see you.

1011
01:12:22,184 --> 01:12:23,776
All right. Bye.

1012
01:12:30,359 --> 01:12:32,259
I'll help you get a cab.

1013
01:12:33,062 --> 01:12:34,620
Thanks.

1014
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:43,067
Hey, George.

1015
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,506
Thanks for being
such a great listener.

1016
01:12:48,711 --> 01:12:52,010
And no matter what,
I get to have friends.

1017
01:13:01,123 --> 01:13:02,852
I will take you up on that.

1018
01:13:05,461 --> 01:13:07,053
Okay.

1019
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:25,071
- Thanks.
- Thanks. Yeah.

1020
01:13:27,917 --> 01:13:32,445
Slump city can be murder,
so call me whenever.

1021
01:13:43,899 --> 01:13:47,335
Of every thought I had about you,
and there were millions...

1022
01:13:47,503 --> 01:13:52,668
...the one that never occurred to me
is that my mind wasn't exaggerating.

1023
01:13:52,942 --> 01:13:57,140
Cut it out. I go boyfriend.

1024
01:14:01,784 --> 01:14:03,615
Fifteenth and I.

1025
01:14:17,466 --> 01:14:20,924
- I'm not saying she was reaching out.
- Okay.

1026
01:14:21,103 --> 01:14:25,301
I'm not saying she was coming on.
But she was definitely talking to me.

1027
01:14:29,612 --> 01:14:31,773
You have to see your father.

1028
01:14:31,947 --> 01:14:33,574
Why?

1029
01:14:34,617 --> 01:14:38,519
He's one of the few people
willing to talk to you.

1030
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:43,483
Tell him...

1031
01:14:43,759 --> 01:14:45,693
Oh, God.

1032
01:14:49,365 --> 01:14:51,993
Your son is here to see you,
Mr. Madison.

1033
01:14:56,672 --> 01:14:58,299
Finally.

1034
01:14:59,975 --> 01:15:02,500
Have you been avoiding me?

1035
01:15:03,813 --> 01:15:05,508
Yes.

1036
01:15:05,915 --> 01:15:07,041
Absolutely.

1037
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:09,242
Why?

1038
01:15:13,756 --> 01:15:15,348
Did you do it?

1039
01:15:17,259 --> 01:15:18,351
Did I?

1040
01:15:19,762 --> 01:15:21,286
Do it.

1041
01:15:22,198 --> 01:15:25,725
My gosh. You're not asking if...

1042
01:15:25,901 --> 01:15:28,028
No. What I'm asking...

1043
01:15:28,671 --> 01:15:30,434
...is did you...

1044
01:15:30,606 --> 01:15:34,007
...fabricate earnings for the analysts
and either knowingly...

1045
01:15:34,343 --> 01:15:37,073
...or accidentally,
put me in this spot?

1046
01:15:37,246 --> 01:15:39,737
Did you do that? And if you did...

1047
01:15:39,915 --> 01:15:42,782
...are you still looking,
even at this moment...

1048
01:15:42,952 --> 01:15:44,852
...for a way to handle it, and me...

1049
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:47,784
...without telling me
you committed a criminal act?

1050
01:15:47,957 --> 01:15:50,653
Now, wait. Just, easy.

1051
01:15:51,026 --> 01:15:55,360
This ground we're stepping on here
is wall-to-wall minefields.

1052
01:15:57,099 --> 01:16:01,092
Oh, for God's sakes. You're a crook.

1053
01:16:02,204 --> 01:16:05,139
What exactly did you do?

1054
01:16:06,308 --> 01:16:07,741
I did...

1055
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:10,970
...what everybody who does business
in the Mideast does...

1056
01:16:11,313 --> 01:16:14,373
...who is not Microsoft
or selling something indispensable.

1057
01:16:15,451 --> 01:16:20,252
You pay a toll in the Mideast,
no matter what the country is!

1058
01:16:20,422 --> 01:16:24,654
If you want to sell in Egypt,
you go there! You rent an office...

1059
01:16:24,827 --> 01:16:28,820
Stop shouting. I don't hear you
when you do that, ever.

1060
01:16:33,435 --> 01:16:35,630
- Never?
- Ever.

1061
01:16:47,516 --> 01:16:49,245
You go there...

1062
01:16:50,386 --> 01:16:52,513
...you rent an office...

1063
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:56,349
It's hard not to yell.

1064
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,487
You go there
and you bribe an Egyptian.

1065
01:17:01,664 --> 01:17:03,564
That is what I did.

1066
01:17:03,732 --> 01:17:06,565
Like everybody does.

1067
01:17:06,735 --> 01:17:09,499
I bribed an Egyptian.

1068
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:13,440
We know pissing in the street
is against the law.

1069
01:17:13,609 --> 01:17:16,169
This is spitting in the street.

1070
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:18,142
This is:

1071
01:17:21,283 --> 01:17:24,116
I didn't think that
it would ever touch you.

1072
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:29,981
And I wish I could somehow express
how what is happening to you...

1073
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:33,356
...is the most wrenching experience
of my life.

1074
01:17:33,796 --> 01:17:35,661
And it's not just emotional.

1075
01:17:35,831 --> 01:17:37,423
It's physical.

1076
01:17:37,599 --> 01:17:41,194
It hurts in a profound, deep way.

1077
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:43,668
My muscles. My skin.

1078
01:17:44,173 --> 01:17:46,835
Like those side effects
I got from Lipitor.

1079
01:17:48,544 --> 01:17:50,171
I am anguishing...

1080
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:56,712
...in every way because of
what you are going through.

1081
01:17:56,885 --> 01:17:57,909
And I just...

1082
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:59,585
Oh, stop.

1083
01:17:59,755 --> 01:18:02,417
You damn narcissist, no, you don't.

1084
01:18:02,591 --> 01:18:05,185
You can't cry! You...

1085
01:18:05,361 --> 01:18:06,919
...ethical mutant!

1086
01:18:09,665 --> 01:18:12,429
Better pace yourself, son.

1087
01:18:13,068 --> 01:18:14,433
It gets worse.

1088
01:18:15,671 --> 01:18:17,434
I'm gonna miss you, babe.

1089
01:18:17,606 --> 01:18:19,471
Echo that.

1090
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:22,407
What are you gonna
do with yourself?

1091
01:18:22,578 --> 01:18:25,706
Well, I'll be teaching these great kids
at this clinic.

1092
01:18:25,881 --> 01:18:30,284
Then I'm gonna register for classes.
And the team is playing close by...

1093
01:18:30,452 --> 01:18:33,444
...so I was thinking about stopping by,
but anyway...

1094
01:18:36,658 --> 01:18:38,148
Yeah.

1095
01:18:40,362 --> 01:18:43,763
- We need to talk a second.
- Okay. I will call you from the car.

1096
01:18:45,034 --> 01:18:47,025
Are we monogamous?

1097
01:18:48,237 --> 01:18:50,501
You feel this way
because of the road trip.

1098
01:18:50,672 --> 01:18:52,367
But we don't have time for this.

1099
01:18:52,541 --> 01:18:54,509
How long does it take to answer?

1100
01:18:54,676 --> 01:18:56,576
Well, the answer is yes, of course.

1101
01:18:57,246 --> 01:18:59,771
- Essentially.
- What is "essentially"?

1102
01:19:00,349 --> 01:19:03,978
Let's talk about it. "Essentially."
Here we go.

1103
01:19:06,522 --> 01:19:09,685
Look, I am nothing like
the wild man I used to be.

1104
01:19:09,858 --> 01:19:13,453
If it bothers you, I can attempt to
cut out even the anonymous sex...

1105
01:19:13,629 --> 01:19:16,792
...because I think we're heading
for the biggest result...

1106
01:19:16,965 --> 01:19:21,299
...that can happen for a dating couple,
and I'm thrilled about that.

1107
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:23,404
Anonymous sex?

1108
01:19:23,572 --> 01:19:27,167
A guy's willing to go 1000 miles
for you, and you criticize him...

1109
01:19:27,342 --> 01:19:32,405
...because he admittedly hasn't
covered that last yard yet?

1110
01:19:35,751 --> 01:19:38,914
But damn it, you know he's trying.
Your heart goes out a...

1111
01:19:40,522 --> 01:19:41,921
Lisa?

1112
01:19:42,091 --> 01:19:43,683
Lisa.

1113
01:19:45,027 --> 01:19:46,187
Lisa?

1114
01:19:47,196 --> 01:19:50,757
You have to get the team bus!
You never miss the team bus!

1115
01:19:51,133 --> 01:19:52,225
Okay.

1116
01:19:53,735 --> 01:19:56,033
- We'll talk.
- Okay.

1117
01:19:56,271 --> 01:19:59,138
Okay, I'll catch the...
I'm gonna be on time.

1118
01:19:59,308 --> 01:20:01,299
- But we'll talk, okay?
- We'll talk.

1119
01:20:01,477 --> 01:20:03,240
I'm moving out, but we'll talk.

1120
01:20:03,412 --> 01:20:07,439
No, no, no! You can't...
Don't break up with me.

1121
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:12,042
See, that's the thing. I don't know
if what we have is even breakable.

1122
01:20:12,221 --> 01:20:16,180
Of course it is, and you're doing it.
Where are you gonna go?

1123
01:20:17,326 --> 01:20:21,524
My tenants hate my place and want to
get out. Just don't miss the team bus.

1124
01:20:21,964 --> 01:20:26,196
Okay. I'm gonna be monogamous.
I'm gonna be. But you too, right?

1125
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:29,132
You can still move out,
but you'll be monogamous too?

1126
01:20:29,304 --> 01:20:30,328
- Sure.
- Okay?

1127
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:32,968
Give me a real yes.

1128
01:20:34,143 --> 01:20:35,201
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1129
01:20:35,377 --> 01:20:38,471
I think it's gonna be okay.
I know it's gonna be okay.

1130
01:20:38,647 --> 01:20:40,512
- Go.
- All right.

1131
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:47,279
Why do girls always look so pretty
the minute they're not sure about you?

1132
01:20:47,456 --> 01:20:49,890
Just get out of here.

1133
01:20:50,559 --> 01:20:53,027
Okay, no not answering the phone!

1134
01:20:53,962 --> 01:20:55,987
Monogamy!

1135
01:21:02,371 --> 01:21:04,032
Take my advice.

1136
01:21:04,206 --> 01:21:06,504
I think you should
get away from me.

1137
01:21:06,675 --> 01:21:08,165
- What?
- Cut me off.

1138
01:21:08,343 --> 01:21:11,437
I have just been trying
to avoid an inevitable here.

1139
01:21:11,613 --> 01:21:14,582
I work better with facts. Tell me.

1140
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:16,610
How does it get worse?

1141
01:21:24,826 --> 01:21:26,589
George.

1142
01:21:27,329 --> 01:21:31,891
I worked for a boiler stock operation
when I was 19.

1143
01:21:32,067 --> 01:21:34,558
There was a violation.

1144
01:21:36,104 --> 01:21:38,971
I got one year's probation.

1145
01:21:39,141 --> 01:21:41,974
Okay, and you're bringing this up
now because?

1146
01:21:43,812 --> 01:21:45,302
Go.

1147
01:21:45,647 --> 01:21:47,512
Because of that...

1148
01:21:47,683 --> 01:21:51,380
...if they find me at all responsible
for the current problems...

1149
01:21:51,553 --> 01:21:55,990
...I would be classified
as a repeat offender.

1150
01:21:56,692 --> 01:21:58,489
And your sentence would be?

1151
01:22:00,395 --> 01:22:03,387
Twenty-five years to dead.

1152
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:07,294
That's why I didn't come forward.

1153
01:22:12,207 --> 01:22:13,765
Dad...

1154
01:22:15,611 --> 01:22:16,976
...what are we gonna do?

1155
01:22:18,413 --> 01:22:22,975
I need you to go because I am in
a wrestling match with myself here.

1156
01:22:23,151 --> 01:22:26,609
I can't trust myself
not to manipulate you.

1157
01:22:26,788 --> 01:22:29,951
I don't know if I'm doing it now.

1158
01:22:31,827 --> 01:22:32,953
I think I am.

1159
01:22:33,795 --> 01:22:35,786
Why? Is there something else?

1160
01:22:37,466 --> 01:22:40,993
Oh, God! Has it occurred to you,
even as a possibility...

1161
01:22:41,169 --> 01:22:45,367
...that you can say what the situation is
without trying to control the outcome?

1162
01:22:45,907 --> 01:22:48,137
- No.
- Try!

1163
01:22:56,918 --> 01:23:00,945
If you were to plead out,
the sentence would be three years...

1164
01:23:01,123 --> 01:23:04,183
...with a chance of getting it down
to less than two.

1165
01:23:07,562 --> 01:23:09,223
And you'd?

1166
01:23:09,464 --> 01:23:12,627
Get off. Maybe.

1167
01:23:13,568 --> 01:23:14,660
Probably.

1168
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:22,834
Is that everything?

1169
01:23:24,046 --> 01:23:25,513
Yeah.

1170
01:23:30,619 --> 01:23:32,553
So it's either...

1171
01:23:38,994 --> 01:23:40,427
l...

1172
01:23:52,607 --> 01:23:54,165
U.S. A!

1173
01:23:55,544 --> 01:23:57,876
Good game, coach. All right.

1174
01:24:01,249 --> 01:24:03,240
- Good game.
- Good game.

1175
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:51,528
- Hello? Hello?
- Hello?

1176
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:53,691
Hello? Can you hear me?

1177
01:24:53,869 --> 01:24:55,598
- Hello?
- George?

1178
01:24:56,405 --> 01:24:59,033
- Hi.
- Hi.

1179
01:24:59,608 --> 01:25:00,939
How are you doing?

1180
01:25:01,143 --> 01:25:03,475
Good. You okay?

1181
01:25:04,513 --> 01:25:07,073
- Yeah. Are you home?
- Yeah.

1182
01:25:07,249 --> 01:25:08,910
Good.

1183
01:25:09,084 --> 01:25:11,484
- You okay?
- Yeah. Sure am.

1184
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:13,348
I just...

1185
01:25:13,955 --> 01:25:15,820
I hope it's not too late to call.

1186
01:25:17,392 --> 01:25:18,450
No. No.

1187
01:25:19,227 --> 01:25:22,458
Not at all. What...? What's going on?

1188
01:25:22,631 --> 01:25:26,658
Oh, good. Nothing. I just...

1189
01:25:26,835 --> 01:25:28,962
We made an indefinite plan
to hang out...

1190
01:25:29,137 --> 01:25:32,231
...so I just thought I'd nail it down.

1191
01:25:32,407 --> 01:25:34,375
Schedule my week.

1192
01:25:35,076 --> 01:25:38,170
Well, anytime.

1193
01:25:38,713 --> 01:25:41,614
Though soon would be advisable.

1194
01:25:41,783 --> 01:25:45,514
I mean, I guess
it's too late for tonight.

1195
01:25:45,687 --> 01:25:48,588
- No, not at all.
- Okay.

1196
01:25:48,757 --> 01:25:52,887
I'm waiting for a call from my friend,
in case she has her baby tonight...

1197
01:25:53,061 --> 01:25:55,291
...but we can deal with that
if it happens.

1198
01:25:55,464 --> 01:25:57,523
Yeah, yeah, we can deal
with that or...

1199
01:25:58,233 --> 01:26:01,225
What the heck?
Let's just give it a shot.

1200
01:26:02,103 --> 01:26:05,004
So I could be there in...

1201
01:26:06,441 --> 01:26:08,875
...less than 30 minutes.
- Good.

1202
01:26:09,277 --> 01:26:12,644
Although, you know, this time
of night, it could be sooner.

1203
01:26:12,814 --> 01:26:13,838
Great.

1204
01:26:14,015 --> 01:26:15,505
Good. I hope so.

1205
01:26:16,818 --> 01:26:20,914
Okay. So I'll see you soon...

1206
01:26:21,823 --> 01:26:24,087
...and we'll just hang out.

1207
01:26:24,926 --> 01:26:27,087
I mean, do you feel like
hanging out or...?

1208
01:26:27,596 --> 01:26:29,120
Yes.

1209
01:26:30,966 --> 01:26:32,058
Okay.

1210
01:26:32,234 --> 01:26:33,701
Okay.

1211
01:26:34,302 --> 01:26:35,667
Okay.

1212
01:26:37,939 --> 01:26:39,201
Bye.

1213
01:26:39,508 --> 01:26:41,032
Bye.

1214
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:09,594
Hi.

1215
01:27:09,771 --> 01:27:11,432
I think I should go.

1216
01:27:12,707 --> 01:27:14,038
Yeah. Yeah.

1217
01:27:15,710 --> 01:27:17,575
I was downstairs when I called you.

1218
01:27:18,313 --> 01:27:21,282
- I know.
- You weren't gonna say anything?

1219
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:23,313
- No.
- Why not?

1220
01:27:24,219 --> 01:27:26,949
- I didn't want to...
- Embarrass me.

1221
01:27:27,122 --> 01:27:30,250
- Some cousin of that.
- Oh, God.

1222
01:27:36,998 --> 01:27:39,398
You look good. You look rested.

1223
01:27:39,568 --> 01:27:42,765
Although everyone I know looks
rested. George, help me out.

1224
01:27:43,505 --> 01:27:44,938
- With?
- You said it.

1225
01:27:45,106 --> 01:27:49,338
"Ever wish you could delete everything
you said as soon as you'd said it?"

1226
01:27:49,511 --> 01:27:52,947
I thought it was strange,
but lately all I do is hear myself...

1227
01:27:53,114 --> 01:27:57,073
...being so weak and whiny and needy
that I wish I could delete every...

1228
01:27:58,253 --> 01:28:00,687
I think the answer to that
is to stop talking.

1229
01:28:00,855 --> 01:28:03,153
Deny a voice to what's falling apart.

1230
01:28:03,325 --> 01:28:07,887
No lip service, that's my advice to you.
Which I think I got from you.

1231
01:28:08,063 --> 01:28:11,089
Now, I'm sorry to handle you
and the situation like this.

1232
01:28:11,266 --> 01:28:13,598
It was just an impulse.
I'm gonna let go now.

1233
01:28:14,603 --> 01:28:16,400
Please don't hit me.

1234
01:28:31,987 --> 01:28:33,147
Hey.

1235
01:28:33,555 --> 01:28:35,113
Yeah?

1236
01:28:35,790 --> 01:28:37,451
How much?

1237
01:28:37,626 --> 01:28:39,423
How do you feel?

1238
01:28:43,131 --> 01:28:45,691
Yeah, sure. Now.

1239
01:28:47,068 --> 01:28:49,229
Can I bring a friend?

1240
01:28:49,504 --> 01:28:51,870
All right. See you soon.

1241
01:28:53,975 --> 01:28:55,875
She had the baby.

1242
01:28:57,345 --> 01:28:59,313
I'm gonna head over there.

1243
01:29:00,815 --> 01:29:01,873
You wanna come?

1244
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:07,754
No, no. I'll just...

1245
01:29:08,690 --> 01:29:12,786
I don't wanna be in the way.
And then I'd just feel like...

1246
01:29:13,695 --> 01:29:15,830
Sure, okay, thanks.

1247
01:29:16,498 --> 01:29:18,193
Sweetie.

1248
01:29:25,206 --> 01:29:27,731
- Hi, boss.
- Hey.

1249
01:29:28,443 --> 01:29:30,468
You are?

1250
01:29:30,912 --> 01:29:33,005
This is Lisa.

1251
01:29:33,181 --> 01:29:35,206
Annie's told us about you both.

1252
01:29:37,619 --> 01:29:40,144
- I'm George Madison.
- Good to see you, George.

1253
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:41,879
- Hi, George.
- Congratulations.

1254
01:29:42,057 --> 01:29:44,252
Lisa. Lisa Jorgenson.
Nice to meet you.

1255
01:29:44,492 --> 01:29:46,756
Thanks, you guys. Dad.

1256
01:29:46,928 --> 01:29:51,797
Remember, there are a lot of TV shows
with single-mom heroines. Okay?

1257
01:29:51,966 --> 01:29:54,901
I'm fine. It's fine.
Everybody's healthy.

1258
01:29:55,070 --> 01:29:57,538
That's it. That's it, right?

1259
01:29:58,306 --> 01:29:59,898
Modern times.

1260
01:30:00,075 --> 01:30:01,406
I'm very happy.

1261
01:30:01,576 --> 01:30:03,567
I know.

1262
01:30:04,512 --> 01:30:05,604
It's killing him.

1263
01:30:09,217 --> 01:30:11,981
So glad to meet you finally.

1264
01:30:12,153 --> 01:30:13,814
Oh, yeah.

1265
01:30:15,156 --> 01:30:17,317
- Gee whiz!
- Yeah.

1266
01:30:17,659 --> 01:30:18,921
Big boy.

1267
01:30:19,427 --> 01:30:21,691
Ten pounds 10.

1268
01:30:22,163 --> 01:30:23,494
And I'm three days early.

1269
01:30:24,799 --> 01:30:25,891
Are you exhausted?

1270
01:30:27,068 --> 01:30:28,467
I'm slaphappy.

1271
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:34,608
World's luckiest baby.

1272
01:30:37,579 --> 01:30:40,514
Leave it to boss
to say the great thing.

1273
01:30:41,416 --> 01:30:43,077
Excuse me.

1274
01:30:44,486 --> 01:30:45,510
Hello?

1275
01:30:46,454 --> 01:30:48,422
Oh, hi.

1276
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:51,354
You're here.
You're just a couple of doors down.

1277
01:30:51,526 --> 01:30:55,257
Ask for Double Digit's room,
that's what we're calling him for now.

1278
01:30:55,430 --> 01:30:56,692
Okay.

1279
01:30:57,899 --> 01:30:59,833
Bubba!

1280
01:31:01,469 --> 01:31:02,629
Yeah, that's him.

1281
01:31:02,804 --> 01:31:04,863
Okay, I'll see you soon.

1282
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:06,904
Hey, buddy.

1283
01:31:07,308 --> 01:31:09,105
Get ready to meet your daddy.

1284
01:31:11,379 --> 01:31:13,540
We'll grab some coffee.
You want anything?

1285
01:31:13,882 --> 01:31:15,941
Oh, thank you, no.

1286
01:31:22,257 --> 01:31:24,987
No. No.

1287
01:31:27,395 --> 01:31:30,330
You wore your suit!

1288
01:31:33,868 --> 01:31:35,096
- AI.
- Oh, hey.

1289
01:31:35,270 --> 01:31:39,001
Congratulations on
the birth of your baby.

1290
01:31:41,776 --> 01:31:43,744
It's good of you to come,
Mr. Madison.

1291
01:31:44,646 --> 01:31:47,638
- Boy or a girl?
- Boy.

1292
01:31:50,752 --> 01:31:53,516
Maybe he'll meet somebody
in the nursery.

1293
01:31:55,223 --> 01:31:58,158
I just wanted to drop this off...

1294
01:31:58,326 --> 01:32:02,820
...and tell you not to worry
about your job. In any way.

1295
01:32:02,997 --> 01:32:05,864
Oh, my God, that's great to hear.
Thank you.

1296
01:32:09,537 --> 01:32:11,562
- You okay?
- Tops.

1297
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:14,538
I thought you might be here.

1298
01:32:15,076 --> 01:32:16,737
Would you...

1299
01:32:17,245 --> 01:32:20,408
...like to talk? Go over anything?
Any new thoughts?

1300
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:23,517
No, not yet.

1301
01:32:24,285 --> 01:32:25,843
You're thinking things out.

1302
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:30,514
Not at this precise moment.
I'm on a break.

1303
01:32:30,925 --> 01:32:34,190
Okay, Gidge. Fine.

1304
01:32:43,571 --> 01:32:47,098
- You a relative of Annie's?
- Oh, no, I'm a friend of...

1305
01:32:47,275 --> 01:32:50,472
How you doing? I'm Al.
I'm the baby's father.

1306
01:32:50,645 --> 01:32:52,135
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1307
01:32:52,580 --> 01:32:56,914
Okay, Al, let me tell you all there is
to know about raising a kid.

1308
01:32:57,619 --> 01:32:59,587
Do not beat yourself
over the head...

1309
01:32:59,754 --> 01:33:03,622
...with any notions that
someone else is doing it right.

1310
01:33:03,791 --> 01:33:07,056
Yeah, well, actually, my mom
and pop, they did it right.

1311
01:33:07,228 --> 01:33:09,128
Yours too, right, Annie?

1312
01:33:09,797 --> 01:33:10,821
Yeah.

1313
01:33:13,167 --> 01:33:15,294
Mine too. Sorry.

1314
01:33:19,507 --> 01:33:22,067
Okay. Nice visit.

1315
01:33:22,644 --> 01:33:25,545
Bye, all. Love you, son.

1316
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:27,140
Good night.

1317
01:33:27,315 --> 01:33:31,411
Awfully glad I came by,
and happy parenting.

1318
01:33:34,589 --> 01:33:37,149
Awfully glad I came by.

1319
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:40,387
Boss?

1320
01:33:40,561 --> 01:33:43,121
When he walked in,
you didn't think that?

1321
01:33:43,298 --> 01:33:46,267
Oh, you poor guy!

1322
01:33:47,568 --> 01:33:49,729
Oh, my God.

1323
01:33:51,873 --> 01:33:54,000
I'm gonna do something...

1324
01:33:54,542 --> 01:33:57,943
...so you just record it.
It's the red button.

1325
01:33:58,613 --> 01:34:01,104
I gotta say something to you.

1326
01:34:01,282 --> 01:34:02,476
To the two of you.

1327
01:34:05,586 --> 01:34:07,451
Okay.

1328
01:34:09,557 --> 01:34:12,856
I don't want you to think that
the reason we're not married...

1329
01:34:13,027 --> 01:34:16,190
...is because I think anything
of anyone else.

1330
01:34:16,798 --> 01:34:19,562
It's because I'm 40 years old
and I'm a failure.

1331
01:34:19,734 --> 01:34:21,861
I will kill you, you talk like that.

1332
01:34:22,036 --> 01:34:26,336
I'll get work again, I know. I won't have
seniority because of what happened.

1333
01:34:26,507 --> 01:34:28,099
I don't wanna get sidetracked.

1334
01:34:28,276 --> 01:34:32,508
The reason that I never
talked marriage to you...

1335
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:37,911
...is because I couldn't stand
to see you, the princess of worry...

1336
01:34:38,086 --> 01:34:41,681
...weighted down by me
and my limited prospects.

1337
01:34:41,856 --> 01:34:43,585
Because I get your worry, Annie.

1338
01:34:44,158 --> 01:34:47,924
I know a lot of people think that's
a bad thing about you. But I know...

1339
01:34:48,196 --> 01:34:51,927
...that it's because you have a great
big heart, and I love you for it!

1340
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:53,795
You know? And then...

1341
01:34:53,968 --> 01:34:58,496
...I started to worry, all right?
About what would happen to you...

1342
01:35:00,141 --> 01:35:02,166
...and this little hulk...

1343
01:35:03,544 --> 01:35:06,377
...if you guys wound up
with someone who...

1344
01:35:07,248 --> 01:35:09,682
Who thought that your worry was...

1345
01:35:10,785 --> 01:35:12,150
...you know...
- Neurotic?

1346
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,845
Right, yeah.
Somebody who didn't get you.

1347
01:35:15,023 --> 01:35:17,457
Who wanted you to feel bad
about yourself.

1348
01:35:17,625 --> 01:35:21,391
Wanted to make you be more normal
or wanted you to change...

1349
01:35:21,562 --> 01:35:25,931
...or like yourself more.
Who didn't love all of it, Annie.

1350
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:28,864
Who didn't wanna
leave great enough alone.

1351
01:35:30,471 --> 01:35:33,406
And I thought that I...

1352
01:35:34,375 --> 01:35:36,206
I could do that for you.

1353
01:35:36,911 --> 01:35:39,311
That could be a legitimate...

1354
01:35:39,914 --> 01:35:42,781
...function for me in your life.

1355
01:35:46,788 --> 01:35:48,016
So that allows me...

1356
01:35:48,356 --> 01:35:51,052
- Oh, my God.
...to propose to you...

1357
01:35:52,193 --> 01:35:54,354
...that we get married.
I wanna marry you.

1358
01:35:56,497 --> 01:35:58,260
Oh, Al!

1359
01:36:02,336 --> 01:36:03,826
Wait.

1360
01:36:04,572 --> 01:36:07,564
- Be careful.
- I'm crushing him.

1361
01:36:09,610 --> 01:36:11,271
Did you get it?

1362
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:15,008
- Oh, my God. I got so caught...
- You didn't get it?

1363
01:36:15,349 --> 01:36:16,373
No...

1364
01:36:16,551 --> 01:36:18,178
- He didn't get it.
- He didn't...?

1365
01:36:18,352 --> 01:36:20,047
You didn't get it?!

1366
01:36:20,221 --> 01:36:21,518
Oh, my God!

1367
01:36:21,789 --> 01:36:22,915
You didn't get it?!

1368
01:36:23,458 --> 01:36:25,949
I'm so sorry! Oh, my God!
I can't tell you how...

1369
01:36:26,127 --> 01:36:28,823
- Oh, no!
- I don't know what to say.

1370
01:36:28,996 --> 01:36:32,295
- Okay, come on, we'll do it again.
- I can't do it again!

1371
01:36:32,467 --> 01:36:33,627
- What's your name?
- AI.

1372
01:36:33,801 --> 01:36:35,666
Al. Okay. You'll record it.

1373
01:36:35,837 --> 01:36:37,828
I don't know what I said!
Who knows?

1374
01:36:38,005 --> 01:36:41,907
We just have to think and we'll piece
this thing together. Right away.

1375
01:36:42,076 --> 01:36:43,703
You were sitting. So sit down.

1376
01:36:44,345 --> 01:36:48,179
Okay. You told her that
you didn't want her to think that...

1377
01:36:48,349 --> 01:36:51,341
I don't want you to think
the reason we're not married...

1378
01:36:51,519 --> 01:36:54,044
...is because I feel anything
for anybody else.

1379
01:36:54,388 --> 01:36:55,412
Exactly! Yes, yes!

1380
01:36:55,590 --> 01:36:58,650
You said you had no prospects.
You used the word "failure."

1381
01:36:58,826 --> 01:37:01,226
I won't saddle you with
a 40-year-old failure.

1382
01:37:01,395 --> 01:37:03,522
Annie, you said, "I'll kill you..."

1383
01:37:03,698 --> 01:37:06,292
I'll kill...
I'll kill you if you talk like that!

1384
01:37:06,467 --> 01:37:08,264
I remember that.

1385
01:37:08,436 --> 01:37:10,904
You said you didn't want her
to end up with...

1386
01:37:11,072 --> 01:37:13,802
Someone who wanted her
to change what she couldn't.

1387
01:37:13,975 --> 01:37:16,341
- Yes.
- Someone who didn't get me.

1388
01:37:16,511 --> 01:37:19,412
- There was that whole list.
- He was worried about you.

1389
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:23,311
Worried you'd be with somebody
who made you feel bad about yourself.

1390
01:37:23,484 --> 01:37:26,920
Who wanted you to like yourself
in a different way.

1391
01:37:28,556 --> 01:37:30,751
Who didn't love you the right way.

1392
01:37:31,626 --> 01:37:33,093
Protecting her from that...

1393
01:37:33,261 --> 01:37:37,061
...appreciating her the way you do
was a legitimate function for you.

1394
01:37:37,231 --> 01:37:38,721
Wow, I said that?

1395
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:40,959
I feel like you're all proposing to me.

1396
01:37:41,135 --> 01:37:43,160
Then I asked you to marry me.

1397
01:37:43,337 --> 01:37:47,034
No! No. What you said was:

1398
01:37:47,208 --> 01:37:50,177
"I propose to you
that we get married."

1399
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:54,843
- I propose to you that we get married.
- That's it.

1400
01:37:55,016 --> 01:37:58,452
- And then you called him "little hulk."
- Yes.

1401
01:37:58,619 --> 01:38:01,213
Which, for some reason,
is my favorite thing.

1402
01:38:01,389 --> 01:38:03,653
Look at this guy.

1403
01:38:08,329 --> 01:38:10,229
I love you so much, Al.

1404
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:35,989
I'm just gonna wait here
for my bus.

1405
01:38:36,157 --> 01:38:38,182
I'll wait with you.

1406
01:38:38,359 --> 01:38:41,385
Okay, good. Thanks.

1407
01:38:47,635 --> 01:38:49,432
Don't you miss them already?

1408
01:38:51,038 --> 01:38:52,938
I'm okay.

1409
01:38:54,308 --> 01:38:57,675
Don't you think that what he said
applies to so many...?

1410
01:39:05,286 --> 01:39:08,278
Well, take care.

1411
01:39:08,456 --> 01:39:11,152
Yeah. You too.

1412
01:39:11,659 --> 01:39:12,683
You too.

1413
01:39:16,631 --> 01:39:18,622
Can't catch a break!

1414
01:39:40,221 --> 01:39:41,848
George!

1415
01:39:42,556 --> 01:39:43,614
George!

1416
01:39:44,158 --> 01:39:46,388
What is wrong with you?

1417
01:39:47,061 --> 01:39:48,585
What?

1418
01:39:49,530 --> 01:39:53,899
What? I saw you.
You were shouting and all crazy.

1419
01:39:54,068 --> 01:39:56,059
No, l...

1420
01:39:56,704 --> 01:39:59,867
I just... It was weird
that you were off so fast.

1421
01:40:00,041 --> 01:40:03,704
Well, I can wait for the next bus.

1422
01:40:04,178 --> 01:40:05,645
You just charged off.

1423
01:40:06,881 --> 01:40:09,850
Okay. Well, good.

1424
01:40:10,017 --> 01:40:14,954
Well, you know, that's...
We should have plenty of time now.

1425
01:40:15,589 --> 01:40:17,420
Well...

1426
01:40:18,893 --> 01:40:20,520
What is this?

1427
01:40:20,695 --> 01:40:23,664
I think this is the opposite
of a bus strike.

1428
01:40:28,002 --> 01:40:30,197
So won't Matty be worried?

1429
01:40:34,108 --> 01:40:36,941
I didn't tell you we're
not living together right now?

1430
01:40:37,478 --> 01:40:38,945
No, I would have remembered.

1431
01:40:39,513 --> 01:40:41,913
Can you give us two seconds?
It's important.

1432
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:44,313
- No problem, pal.
- Okay.

1433
01:40:44,685 --> 01:40:45,947
What?

1434
01:40:46,954 --> 01:40:50,720
We're still working on things,
but from a different slant.

1435
01:40:50,891 --> 01:40:54,918
He's back tomorrow. He's throwing me
a belated birthday party tomorrow night.

1436
01:40:55,096 --> 01:40:56,120
He's going all out.

1437
01:40:56,364 --> 01:40:58,025
Not my choice.

1438
01:40:58,199 --> 01:41:00,895
But when you're in something,
you...

1439
01:41:01,402 --> 01:41:04,997
You gotta give it everything you have.
Else, what are you doing?

1440
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:07,200
Right.

1441
01:41:09,677 --> 01:41:11,577
Oh, man.

1442
01:41:16,851 --> 01:41:19,046
Can I come to your party?

1443
01:41:19,387 --> 01:41:20,752
Can I come to your party?

1444
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:24,480
Sure.

1445
01:41:25,126 --> 01:41:26,889
Of course.

1446
01:41:28,729 --> 01:41:29,923
When was your birthday?

1447
01:41:31,866 --> 01:41:33,299
It was tonight.

1448
01:41:35,603 --> 01:41:36,968
Of course it is.

1449
01:41:40,941 --> 01:41:42,533
Happy birthday.

1450
01:41:42,710 --> 01:41:44,234
Thank you.

1451
01:42:00,528 --> 01:42:01,961
Father.

1452
01:42:08,502 --> 01:42:09,969
George.

1453
01:42:10,137 --> 01:42:12,662
I think I figured it out.
I don't wanna talk now.

1454
01:42:13,707 --> 01:42:16,972
Well, could you give me
some indication?

1455
01:42:17,144 --> 01:42:18,702
Tomorrow.

1456
01:42:21,582 --> 01:42:22,981
I...

1457
01:42:23,384 --> 01:42:25,944
I love you too. Tomorrow.

1458
01:42:45,239 --> 01:42:47,503
- Going to the party, George?
- Not yet.

1459
01:42:49,977 --> 01:42:55,210
Just a minute, son. The lawyers are
taking a break. Leave your stuff.

1460
01:42:55,382 --> 01:42:57,373
Try the coffee shop on the corner.

1461
01:42:57,551 --> 01:43:00,418
Get me that list
of non-extradition countries.

1462
01:43:00,588 --> 01:43:02,579
The fruit salad's very good there.

1463
01:43:09,697 --> 01:43:13,497
- Please sit.
- No, I can't. I have to get someplace.

1464
01:43:14,068 --> 01:43:15,262
You look...

1465
01:43:15,436 --> 01:43:17,700
Great? I'm shooting for great tonight.

1466
01:43:19,306 --> 01:43:20,500
You look great.

1467
01:43:21,108 --> 01:43:25,704
I know you want the bottom line, but
are you interested in my reasoning?

1468
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:28,542
Yes. Of course.

1469
01:43:29,149 --> 01:43:32,016
First thing, and it was
an all-nighter getting there...

1470
01:43:32,186 --> 01:43:36,020
...but same as in anything, the answer
starts with the right question.

1471
01:43:36,190 --> 01:43:39,387
And the question here wasn't
whether I go to jail or you do.

1472
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:41,323
That was not the question.

1473
01:43:41,495 --> 01:43:42,757
- It wasn't?
- No.

1474
01:43:42,930 --> 01:43:46,331
No. The question was,
will I go to jail for three years...

1475
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:51,199
...or will I live for 25 years feeling
awful because of your being in jail?

1476
01:43:51,972 --> 01:43:53,564
Very good.

1477
01:43:53,741 --> 01:43:57,575
So I went over different scenarios
to get varying perspectives.

1478
01:43:57,745 --> 01:44:00,714
If I had children,
I wouldn't consider going to jail.

1479
01:44:01,115 --> 01:44:02,878
- But you don't.
- Right.

1480
01:44:03,050 --> 01:44:04,074
Right.

1481
01:44:04,251 --> 01:44:08,551
Or if I had someone crucial
to the life I want for myself...

1482
01:44:08,722 --> 01:44:10,815
...it would be perverse...

1483
01:44:10,991 --> 01:44:15,928
...some denunciation of the experience
of life itself if I gave that up.

1484
01:44:16,397 --> 01:44:20,265
Well, that is an extreme
point of view.

1485
01:44:20,901 --> 01:44:22,459
Do you have such a person?

1486
01:44:22,636 --> 01:44:27,300
I don't know. But I'm going upstairs
to somehow find out.

1487
01:44:27,474 --> 01:44:31,308
There's a party. She's up there.

1488
01:44:31,512 --> 01:44:32,706
There's another guy.

1489
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:36,338
You mean she may be unavailable.

1490
01:44:36,517 --> 01:44:38,417
I can't think that way right now.

1491
01:44:38,586 --> 01:44:41,953
I'm going up there
and I'm taking my shot.

1492
01:44:42,389 --> 01:44:44,653
If I don't have a chance with her...

1493
01:44:44,825 --> 01:44:46,690
...I will go to jail for you, Dad.

1494
01:44:49,763 --> 01:44:53,699
But if I have any chance at all,
I can't.

1495
01:44:56,704 --> 01:44:58,399
Wish me luck.

1496
01:45:01,809 --> 01:45:03,510
Good luck.

1497
01:45:13,454 --> 01:45:15,319
No unattached women
allowed tonight.

1498
01:45:15,489 --> 01:45:19,619
One guy's bringing his sister.
A couple guys are bringing their moms.

1499
01:45:20,027 --> 01:45:22,730
- How are you?
- I'm great.

1500
01:45:22,796 --> 01:45:25,594
Okay, here we go. I want you to...

1501
01:45:25,766 --> 01:45:28,200
Okay, we'll start right here.

1502
01:45:29,136 --> 01:45:33,129
- Here, have a seat. Go on.
- Okay.

1503
01:45:34,308 --> 01:45:36,538
- Here you go.
- Okay.

1504
01:45:37,244 --> 01:45:39,109
It's not a ring!

1505
01:45:39,647 --> 01:45:42,639
- You don't have to look so relieved.
- No, no, I just...

1506
01:45:42,816 --> 01:45:44,215
Okay.

1507
01:45:44,385 --> 01:45:47,843
Now, maybe I don't
get on a knee for this, but...

1508
01:45:49,256 --> 01:45:50,553
What are you doing?

1509
01:45:51,025 --> 01:45:52,049
Go.

1510
01:45:52,893 --> 01:45:55,259
The wrapping is lovely.

1511
01:45:55,629 --> 01:45:58,029
- Hurry. No, you just...
- It's so nice.

1512
01:45:58,198 --> 01:46:01,656
No, but you can just rip it open.

1513
01:46:06,407 --> 01:46:08,568
It's gorgeous.

1514
01:46:08,809 --> 01:46:11,471
But... I mean, it's gorgeous.

1515
01:46:11,645 --> 01:46:12,669
But what?

1516
01:46:14,248 --> 01:46:17,081
I was thinking, when would I
wear something like this?

1517
01:46:17,251 --> 01:46:20,618
I'll take you places.
Do you not get what this means?

1518
01:46:21,221 --> 01:46:23,689
- You get the mean...
- That time is...

1519
01:46:23,857 --> 01:46:25,290
No, it means we're engaged!

1520
01:46:25,726 --> 01:46:27,557
- What?
- To be engaged.

1521
01:46:28,529 --> 01:46:33,626
My father gave my mother a watch and
seven years later they were engaged.

1522
01:46:37,071 --> 01:46:40,802
It's beautiful. I mean, gorgeous.

1523
01:46:42,876 --> 01:46:44,741
I don't know what to say. L...

1524
01:46:44,912 --> 01:46:46,937
- You're blown away.
- I'm blown away.

1525
01:46:47,114 --> 01:46:49,048
- Come on.
- I'm blown away!

1526
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:52,583
Yes! Come on. Now you're talking.

1527
01:46:52,753 --> 01:46:54,721
Yes! Look at it.

1528
01:46:55,255 --> 01:46:56,813
Sorry.

1529
01:46:57,424 --> 01:46:59,085
Hi.

1530
01:46:59,927 --> 01:47:00,951
You showed.

1531
01:47:01,261 --> 01:47:04,389
Definitely. I'll wait out there.

1532
01:47:04,631 --> 01:47:06,599
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

1533
01:47:06,767 --> 01:47:09,235
Thank you. And you.

1534
01:47:09,970 --> 01:47:12,165
- Okay, we better get going.
- Okay.

1535
01:47:12,339 --> 01:47:14,466
This is our first party as a couple.

1536
01:47:14,641 --> 01:47:16,768
What were we all those other times?

1537
01:47:16,944 --> 01:47:19,071
That's so cute.

1538
01:47:19,346 --> 01:47:20,677
Right?

1539
01:47:20,848 --> 01:47:23,612
Hey, Richie, what's going on?
Hey, Mrs. Hayes.

1540
01:47:23,784 --> 01:47:26,412
I should find George.
He doesn't know anybody.

1541
01:47:26,587 --> 01:47:27,611
I'll go with you.

1542
01:47:27,788 --> 01:47:29,949
- Tori's mom wants to meet you.
- Right now?

1543
01:47:30,124 --> 01:47:31,751
She's a fan.

1544
01:47:34,328 --> 01:47:36,853
- I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

1545
01:47:41,435 --> 01:47:43,130
Here, sit down.

1546
01:47:45,939 --> 01:47:48,533
I got you a gift.

1547
01:47:48,709 --> 01:47:50,370
Thanks.

1548
01:48:18,705 --> 01:48:20,070
Thanks for not rushing me.

1549
01:48:22,476 --> 01:48:23,909
Yeah.

1550
01:48:35,422 --> 01:48:38,289
- This is only half the gift.
- Yeah?

1551
01:48:38,458 --> 01:48:41,859
- It doesn't work without the story.
- Okay.

1552
01:48:42,796 --> 01:48:47,460
This stuff was invented
by this man in central Ohio...

1553
01:48:47,634 --> 01:48:51,001
...as a white goo,
and he used it to...

1554
01:48:51,738 --> 01:48:55,834
...remove soot off of wallpaper
from old-fashioned heating.

1555
01:48:56,009 --> 01:49:00,742
So as gas and electric heating
came in, there was...

1556
01:49:00,914 --> 01:49:04,145
...no longer a need
for the cleaning goo.

1557
01:49:05,986 --> 01:49:07,681
So the guy was going under.

1558
01:49:07,955 --> 01:49:10,651
But his sister-in-law was
a nursery school teacher...

1559
01:49:10,824 --> 01:49:12,018
Is this a true story?

1560
01:49:12,192 --> 01:49:16,424
The man's name was Joe McVicker.
His sister-in-law was Kay Zufall.

1561
01:49:17,698 --> 01:49:19,063
Okay, I believe you.

1562
01:49:19,867 --> 01:49:22,199
So Kay Zufall discovered...

1563
01:49:22,369 --> 01:49:24,963
...that her little kids
liked squeezing the goo...

1564
01:49:25,138 --> 01:49:28,904
...a lot more than hard modeling clay.
So she suggested to Joe...

1565
01:49:29,176 --> 01:49:32,942
...that they color the stuff
and call it Play-Doh.

1566
01:49:33,780 --> 01:49:35,338
Hey.

1567
01:49:35,515 --> 01:49:37,244
Nice.

1568
01:49:37,651 --> 01:49:39,414
So...

1569
01:49:42,256 --> 01:49:45,692
...I have kept this for a long time...

1570
01:49:45,859 --> 01:49:47,827
...as proof...

1571
01:49:48,228 --> 01:49:51,595
...that we're all just
one small adjustment away...

1572
01:49:51,765 --> 01:49:54,700
...from making our lives work.

1573
01:50:03,877 --> 01:50:06,869
You can see why
I thought of this for you...

1574
01:50:08,749 --> 01:50:10,580
...can't you?

1575
01:50:14,187 --> 01:50:15,916
Yeah.

1576
01:50:20,761 --> 01:50:21,785
Thanks.

1577
01:50:25,165 --> 01:50:27,463
I'm gonna put it away because...

1578
01:50:28,669 --> 01:50:32,867
...if anybody asks what it is, I could
never tell that story as well as you do.

1579
01:50:47,988 --> 01:50:50,183
- Let us see the watch.
- Yeah.

1580
01:50:50,357 --> 01:50:51,585
Oh, it's beautiful.

1581
01:50:51,758 --> 01:50:53,350
- Matty gave you that?
- Yeah.

1582
01:50:59,466 --> 01:51:01,593
Thank you for having me.

1583
01:51:04,304 --> 01:51:05,931
Excuse me.

1584
01:51:06,873 --> 01:51:09,034
I need to talk to you. Really.

1585
01:51:09,209 --> 01:51:12,770
And that means I need to
get you out of this party.

1586
01:51:12,946 --> 01:51:18,350
If that feels out of the question to you,
there's probably nothing to talk about.

1587
01:51:19,586 --> 01:51:21,884
Good night. Good night.

1588
01:51:23,323 --> 01:51:27,054
I'm gonna go wait
out at the bus stop for the next...

1589
01:51:27,527 --> 01:51:29,222
...10 to 15 hours.

1590
01:51:30,464 --> 01:51:31,488
I'm kidding.

1591
01:51:32,866 --> 01:51:35,096
I'll be out there for a while.

1592
01:51:53,453 --> 01:51:54,852
- Hey.
- Hey.

1593
01:51:55,022 --> 01:51:57,013
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah, come here.

1594
01:51:57,190 --> 01:51:58,521
Okay.

1595
01:52:16,777 --> 01:52:22,272
Matty, I just think things
are moving a little too quickly.

1596
01:52:24,217 --> 01:52:29,314
I almost got you this white silk
bathrobe that had, like, a thing that...

1597
01:52:29,489 --> 01:52:31,389
I saw the watch and I got excited.

1598
01:52:31,558 --> 01:52:34,925
I thought it was maybe
four or five months too early...

1599
01:52:35,095 --> 01:52:38,189
...but if it was a mistake,
it was a mistake of enthusiasm.

1600
01:52:38,365 --> 01:52:41,129
I'm gonna go hang out with George
for a little bit.

1601
01:52:41,735 --> 01:52:44,602
- He wants to talk and l...
- Okay. Go ahead.

1602
01:52:47,607 --> 01:52:49,575
Okay.

1603
01:52:49,843 --> 01:52:53,677
But take into account that
I have the confidence to say that.

1604
01:52:53,847 --> 01:52:55,678
Which is kind of a big deal.

1605
01:52:56,950 --> 01:52:58,315
Okay.

1606
01:52:58,485 --> 01:53:01,977
You understand? I'm saying yes, go,
but recognize the confidence.

1607
01:53:02,155 --> 01:53:05,283
I get afraid you're missing
my confidence here.

1608
01:53:05,625 --> 01:53:07,684
No, I get it.

1609
01:53:08,095 --> 01:53:09,187
Good.

1610
01:53:10,197 --> 01:53:12,961
Do you...? But... I don't mean
to keep harping on it...

1611
01:53:13,133 --> 01:53:16,625
...but I think that that's key
to any decision you make.

1612
01:53:16,803 --> 01:53:19,237
That you're gonna have to...

1613
01:53:29,416 --> 01:53:30,678
What did I do wrong?

1614
01:53:31,118 --> 01:53:32,983
Nothing.

1615
01:53:33,887 --> 01:53:37,345
You're great.
You're sweet, you're fun.

1616
01:53:37,657 --> 01:53:38,851
You are.

1617
01:53:42,629 --> 01:53:45,120
All the hot words.

1618
01:53:55,175 --> 01:53:57,075
Talk to you later.

1619
01:54:44,624 --> 01:54:45,750
You hungry?

1620
01:54:46,126 --> 01:54:47,593
Always.

1621
01:54:47,961 --> 01:54:50,759
- I have Annie's stuff.
- Okay.

1622
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:15,322
I just had a thought.

1623
01:55:17,891 --> 01:55:21,486
Did you come down here
to tell me not to bother waiting?

1624
01:55:27,467 --> 01:55:29,196
No.

1625
01:55:39,846 --> 01:55:41,108
George.

1626
01:55:43,350 --> 01:55:46,786
I thought you were this silly guy.

1627
01:55:46,953 --> 01:55:49,444
Now it's like...

1628
01:55:50,090 --> 01:55:52,991
...everything but you seems silly.

1629
01:55:53,593 --> 01:55:56,153
- Who knows what I'm saying?
- I think I know.

1630
01:55:56,429 --> 01:55:57,453
What?

1631
01:55:58,064 --> 01:56:00,760
It's just a thought l... I might not be...

1632
01:56:00,934 --> 01:56:03,300
- What?
- You love me too.

1633
01:56:31,698 --> 01:56:34,098
Stop looking at me.

1634
02:00:35,875 --> 02:00:38,309
Tonight I'm in

1635
02:00:38,478 --> 02:00:42,812
A romantic mood, yeah
