1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,600
"There she is.
That's the one."

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,000
"What have you done with
Spock's brain?

3
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:05,000
"What have you..."

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,165
When you're twelve years old,

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,800
you've got a lot of strange
new territory to explore.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,400
For Paul and me,
that meant the basement

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,200
with Carla Healey
and Becky Slater.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,165
Paul and I weren't the world's
greatest make-out experts,

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,400
but I figured all I had to do
was wait for the sign from Becky.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,000
That was the sign.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,800
Hi, Mom.
So, you're doing laundry!

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,000
Yeah, I thought I would.

13
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,500
You're folding, Kevin.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Kevin, what's that on you're neck?

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,765
Mom, be cool.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,700
- Oh this?
It's-it's a bug bite.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,100
It was embarrassing
for everyone.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,500
Almost everyone.

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,665
I don't know, Mom.

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,900
Looks to me as though it just
might be...

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,900
...a monstro-hickey,
a love bite...

22
00:01:14,935 --> 00:01:17,300
...a big juicy lip burn.

23
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,800
But that's just a guess.

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,600
Take this upstairs.

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,700
Why don't you kids come
upstairs and watch TV?

26
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,800
Star Trek's almost over.

27
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,000
- As soon as it is.
- Ok.

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,365
A bug bite?

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,900
Well, what did you
want me to say?

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,500
I'll give you a bug bite.

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,665
- Wait. Get off! Becky!
- No, no!

32
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,600
And so the days passed,
carefree and lighthearted.

33
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,000
Paul and I seemed to have found a
truce in the war of the sexes.

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,300
Everything was simple and fun.

35
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,200
In other words,
it had to end.

36
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,900
- Hey, Kevin.
Come here for a second.

37
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:07,100
I want to ask you something.

38
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,000
I want to ask you a favor.

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,765
Kirk McCray
wanted to ask me a favor?

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,400
Kirk McCray who had stolen
Winnie away from me?

41
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,200
Who had humiliated me?
Defeated me?

42
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:18,500
Ruined my life?

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,600
Eh, but I was over that.
I had Becky and...

44
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,900
I need you to talk to
Winnie for me.

45
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,700
What?
What?

46
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,600
I need you to talk to Winnie for me.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,650
I mean, well,
I understand if you don't want to.

48
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:32,892
No, Kirk, I want to talk to
Winnie Cooper for you

49
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:35,213
almost as much as
I want to be stabbed through

50
00:02:35,248 --> 00:02:37,500
the heart fifty times
with a dull butter knife.

51
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,100
But, I mean, she'll take it
better coming from you.

52
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:41,817
She really likes you.

53
00:02:41,852 --> 00:02:43,500
She does?
She does?

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,600
Well, yeah. I mean, you guys are
really good friends, aren't you?

55
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,100
Yeah, I guess so.

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,500
So, do you think you can just ask
her if-if she still likes me?

57
00:02:54,535 --> 00:02:56,000
I thought you guys
were going steady.

58
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh, man.
I don't know what's goin' on.

59
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,400
I mean, she didn't say anything,
but it's just the way she says it.

60
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,800
You know what I mean?
She's gonna dump me, I know it.

61
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:10,600
Really?
Really?

62
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,800
I don't know.

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,000
She didn't say
anything to you, did she?

64
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,400
Me? No. I mean, I hardly ever
talk to her any more.

65
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,100
Do you think you can
just ask her for me?

66
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,500
Kirk, I don't think
it'll be such a great idea.

67
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:29,800
Please. I mean, I don't
know what else to do.

68
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,000
You know, I mean,
I've liked girls before and all,

69
00:03:33,035 --> 00:03:34,900
but not like I like her.

70
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,000
There's just something about her.
You know what I mean?

71
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,065
Yeah.

72
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,765
Yeah. But I just don't think

73
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,900
If it's a hassle, you know,
forget it.

74
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,265
Wait a minute.
I could do this.

75
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,600
What's the big deal?
Winnie Cooper's yesterday's news.

76
00:03:56,635 --> 00:03:58,600
Anyway,
I had what's-her-name...

77
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,500
...uh, Becky.
Yeah, I had Becky.

78
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:03,300
Kirk, wait a minute.

79
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,200
You'll do it?

80
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes, I'll do it.

81
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,800
Thanks, Kev-bo.

82
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,200
"Kev-bo"?

83
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,200
- You're gonna what?

84
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,600
He just wants me to ask
Winnie if she still,

85
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:23,200
you know, still likes him?

86
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,565
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can.

87
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,500
Kevin, we're talking about
Winnie Cooper here.

88
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,865
I mean, get real.

89
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,965
Well, what's your point?

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,065
Look, I just know that
if Carla dumped me,

91
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,765
I could never go
and talk to her about liking...

92
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,100
- ...the guy she dumped me for.
- She didn't dump me, Paul.

93
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,900
Especially for somebody
like Kirk McCray.

94
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:42,265
It doesn't bother me, okay?

95
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,400
- Somebody older who's,
like, twice my size.

96
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,200
What difference
does that make?

97
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,300
Who's got muscles out to here and a
dark tan in the middle of the winter.

98
00:04:50,335 --> 00:04:52,700
Well, maybe
I'm not like you, Paul.

99
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,400
Maybe I'm just a little more
secure than that, okay?

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,800
Yeah, sure.

101
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,700
There's no way that
I can't talk to Winnie.

102
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:03,765
We're still friends.

103
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,600
All I have to do is go up to
her and say, "Winnie..."

104
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,600
Hi, Kevin.

105
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,100
Grab her. Squeeze her.
Kiss her on the lips.

106
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:23,100
No!

107
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,400
- What?
- Nothing.

108
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,400
I ran into Kirk McCray
this afternoon.

109
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,100
- Oh?
- Yeah.

110
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,900
I didn't see him today.

111
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,700
Really?

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,500
Yeah.

113
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,000
- He's a pretty nice guy.
- Yeah.

114
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,600
Kirk wants to know
if you still like him.

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Kirk wants to know
if you still like him.

116
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,100
Why doesn't he ask me himself?

117
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,800
Because he's a coward
and a fool, not worthy of your...

118
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:12,900
Uh, because...

119
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,765
I guess,

120
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,700
he really likes you, and he doesn't
want to make you feel weird.

121
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,000
He just wants to make
me feel weird.

122
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,365
I don't know.

123
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Do you mean do I "like him" like him,
or do I just like him?

124
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:27,400
- The first one, I guess.
- Well, I like Kirk.

125
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:29,300
But I'm not sure
I "like him" like him.

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,950
- Are you mad at him?
- Not really mad at him.

127
00:06:32,985 --> 00:06:35,900
- Oh, so you like him.
- I didn't say I liked him.

128
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:36,865
I said I liked him.

129
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,100
- Let me have that
one more time...

130
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,065
...slowly.

131
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,865
She's not mad at you.
She likes you.

132
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,200
She's not sure if she "likes you"
likes you, but she likes you.

133
00:06:46,235 --> 00:06:48,600
When she first liked you she
"liked you" liked you,

134
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,900
unless she just thought she liked
you when she really just liked you.

135
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,465
But she likes you.

136
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,265
I knew it.
I'm a dead man.

137
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,700
- Not necessari...
- Come on, you heard her.

138
00:06:57,735 --> 00:06:59,265
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know.

139
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,200
She's waiting for me to
make the right move, isn't she?

140
00:07:01,235 --> 00:07:02,265
Maybe.

141
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,400
- What's the right move?
- I don't know.

142
00:07:04,435 --> 00:07:05,917
Should I give her something?

143
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:07,400
I don't know. You could try.

144
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:08,617
Yeah? Like what?

145
00:07:08,652 --> 00:07:09,765
I don't know!

146
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,100
Well, what would you give her?

147
00:07:11,135 --> 00:07:12,365
Look, Kirk!

148
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,100
Maybe you should just try
and figure this out by yourself.

149
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:18,300
I'm not the best guy to be
giving advice about this.

150
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,100
Wait!

151
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,900
Look, I've got to get to class.

152
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,150
How about this?

153
00:07:24,185 --> 00:07:25,265
What is it?

154
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,700
My all-star patch.

155
00:07:26,735 --> 00:07:28,065
Your all-star patch?

156
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,200
Yeah, she could, you know,
sew it on her sweater or jacket.

157
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:32,767
- Girls do that, don't they?

158
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:34,300
How am I supposed to know?

159
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,800
Kev-bo.

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,200
Yeah?

161
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,900
Will you give this to
Winnie for me?

162
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,465
Kirk, come on.

163
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,200
Please? This is the last
time I'll ask, I swear.

164
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:44,165
I can't.

165
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,800
Look, if it was you and you really
liked Winnie Cooper,

166
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:49,200
I'd do it for you.

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,165
- What am I supposed to
do with this?

168
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,900
You could sew it on your
jacket or sweater.

169
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,250
I don't know.

170
00:07:57,285 --> 00:07:59,200
I can't do that.

171
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,900
It's just a way of
showing friendship.

172
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:04,200
Come on, Kevin.
You know what it means.

173
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
Yeah.

174
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,000
Kevin?

175
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,400
Yeah?

176
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,800
I think I have to break up with him.

177
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,200
Really?

178
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,100
I think so.

179
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,650
This may be none
of my business, Winnie,

180
00:08:20,685 --> 00:08:22,900
but I think you're
doing the right thing.

181
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,900
I mean, there's no use
dragging it out.

182
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,900
You are so right.

183
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
We can still be friends.

184
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,700
Absolutely.

185
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,800
You know, I really tried.

186
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,900
Hey, when it's over...

187
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:38,300
It's over?

188
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,065
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,350
I knew it.
She likes someone else.

190
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:44,600
I don't think
she likes someone else.

191
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,700
Did she say she didn't
like someone else?

192
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,600
Well, she didn't say she didn't.

193
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,900
Look, she said she still
wanted to be friends.

194
00:08:51,935 --> 00:08:54,000
- She said that?!
- Yeah.

195
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,900
I know, I know.

196
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,000
Kirk, get a grip on yourself.

197
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,700
Now, Kirk raises an
interesting question.

198
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What if she does
like someone else?

199
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,400
Maybe that's what this
whole thing is about.

200
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,300
But how can you find out without...

201
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,667
Paul-bo!

202
00:09:19,702 --> 00:09:21,000
"Paul-bo"?

203
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,100
I need you to ask Winnie
something for me.

204
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,300
Things were falling into place.

205
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,400
Kirk and Winnie had broken up.
And why?

206
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,700
Because she'd never
really forgotten me,

207
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,800
all those golden moments
we shared,

208
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,600
our first kiss.

209
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,600
I still remember the way she looked.

210
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,900
She looked...

211
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,200
...just like that.

212
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,600
- What's goin' on, McCray?

213
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
What do you mean?

214
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,200
I thought you and Winnie broke up.
Didn't I make that clear?

215
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,365
You did.

216
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,100
Then I saw you guys making out.

217
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,100
I know.
Isn't that weird?

218
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,900
Then what's going on?

219
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,600
I don't know.
I can't figure it out myself.

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,900
I asked Eric Antonio
to ask her for me.

221
00:10:07,935 --> 00:10:09,200
Eric Antonio?

222
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,600
- Yeah, I hope you don't mind.
- I can't believe this.

223
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
Kevin!

224
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,800
Come here for a second.

225
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,100
Did you ask Winnie for me?

226
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,450
Why would he talk to Winnie?

227
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,665
I couldn't talk to Winnie.

228
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,100
She was with Eric
Antonio all afternoon.

229
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
I think he likes her.

230
00:10:24,635 --> 00:10:25,665
What?!

231
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,300
- I told you,
all we did was talk about you.

232
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,465
"You" who?

233
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,065
- Both of you.
- Both of who?

234
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,365
Look, will you just
answer the question?

235
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,500
- Do you like her or not?
- Well, sure I like her.

236
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:35,900
Well, do you "like her"
like her?

237
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,200
Not like you like her.

238
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,900
- You like her?
- I thought everybody knew that.

239
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:40,965
- You mean you
"like her" like her?

240
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,100
Yeah, I like her.
I liked before you liked her.

241
00:10:43,135 --> 00:10:44,500
You mean you went to
talk to her for me

242
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:45,800
when all this time
you liked her?

243
00:10:45,835 --> 00:10:47,100
Now you like her?

244
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,800
Is there anybody else
that likes Winnie Cooper

245
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:51,465
I should know about?
Paul?

246
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Well, she does have those tiny
little freckles on her nose.

247
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,800
A joke! A joke!

248
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,265
Well, who does she like?

249
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,300
I don't know.
She likes you both.

250
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,300
You mean she
"likes us" likes us?

251
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,665
Well, who does she like better?

252
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,300
- Yeah, who does she like better?
- Yeah, who does she like better?

253
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,265
I don't know.

254
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,800
I'll ask her tonight,
we're going skating.

255
00:11:11,835 --> 00:11:13,000
What?

256
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,300
- Hey, Kevin.

257
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,200
Becky Slater wants to know
if you're mad at her.

258
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:19,865
Becky. Poor little Becky.

259
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,600
In all this confusion,
I'd forgotten all about her.

260
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,000
But now there was
only one thing to do.

261
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,665
I had to tell her the truth,

262
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,200
and not through any go-between
but face-to-face, like a man.

263
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,900
Oh, God, look at her.

264
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,400
Poor sweet flower of a girl.

265
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,600
God, I hated to hurt her.

266
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,200
Well, just get it over with.

267
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,800
Becky, we have to break up.

268
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
I still like Winnie Cooper.

269
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,500
We can still be friends, though.

270
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,900
I know, I know.

271
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,900
Oh yeah, "friends"!?

272
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,500
I'll give you "friends."

273
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,100
I guess that was when it first
occurred to me:

274
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,700
I really
didn't understand girls.

275
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,800
I mean, and let me be absolutely
clear about what I mean,

276
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,900
I really didn't understand girls.

277
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
- Interesting specimens.

278
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,600
Spock, where are we?

279
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,100
It appears, Captain,
that we are on an alien planet,

280
00:13:12,135 --> 00:13:15,500
inhabited by strange beings
with long hair

281
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:18,100
and very short skirts.

282
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,200
Well, hey, since I was having
the fantasy anyway,

283
00:13:20,235 --> 00:13:21,900
I figured I might
as well do it right.

284
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,400
Who are you?
What do want from us?

285
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,950
Highly illogical question, Captain.
These are alien beings.

286
00:13:30,985 --> 00:13:34,300
They think and act in ways you
cannot hope to understand.

287
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,865
Well, what can we do?

288
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,700
There must be some way of
fighting back.

289
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,200
Bones? Scotty?

290
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm afraid we have no choice
but to submit to their every whim.

291
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,000
- We are their captives.
They control us completely.

292
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,400
No, this can't be.

293
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,600
We're human beings.
Can't you understand that?

294
00:13:52,635 --> 00:13:54,000
We're men!

295
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,600
We're men! Men!

296
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,900
- Hey, Kev you're okay?

297
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,500
You okay?

298
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,300
Well, that night
I caught up on something

299
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:24,200
I'd been needing
to do for a long time.

300
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,100
I just shut the door
and lay down on the bed

301
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,300
and put in two hours of good
solid, adolescent self-pity...

302
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,500
...until Winnie got home.

303
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
- Where are you goin'?

304
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,000
Just over to Winnie's
for a minute.

305
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,600
It's a little late, Kevin.

306
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,500
- Just for a minute.
- Can't this wait til tomorrow?

307
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,400
A reasonable question,
but at the moment

308
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,000
I was not a reasonable man.

309
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:06,400
No, it can't

310
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,800
Okay.

311
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,900
Kev-bo.

312
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,265
Eric-bo.

313
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,200
Were you at the skating rink tonight?
I didn't see you.

314
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:34,400
I wasn't there.

315
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,100
Hey, you want to hear what
Winnie said about you?

316
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:38,265
No.

317
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,000
Okay.
Well, I guess I'll see you in school.

318
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,000
See ya.

319
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

320
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,700
Hi.

321
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,700
It's cold. It almost feels
like it might snow.

322
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,100
Yeah. Look, Winnie,
what are you doing?

323
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,665
What do you mean?

324
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,165
What are you doing with Eric?

325
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,500
We went skating.
He's nice to talk to.

326
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,000
He's just a friend.

327
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,600
Yeah, what about Kirk?

328
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,065
I broke up with Kirk.

329
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,200
Yeah, I saw the way
you broke up with him.

330
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,000
In the hallway?

331
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:26,100
Oh. I don't know. I guess that
wasn't such a good idea.

332
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:27,500
You guess?

333
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,200
Well, what business is it
of yours anyway?

334
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm your friend, that's what.

335
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,900
Well, if you're my friend,
then why are you being like this?

336
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,800
- Like what?
- Like...

337
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,400
...oh, I don't know...

338
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,600
Look, don't get all upset.

339
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,500
I have to ask you something.

340
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,300
What?

341
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I just have to know if
you like me or not.

342
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,600
And don't give any of that
"like me" like me stuff.

343
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,265
Well, that was it:

344
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,600
a straightforward,
face-to-face, yes-or-no question.

345
00:17:20,635 --> 00:17:23,900
And I was going to stand there
until I got my answer.

346
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,300
I don't know.

347
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,265
"I don't know"!

348
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,565
What do you mean
you don't know?

349
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,100
I mean I don't know.
I really don't know.

350
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,400
I wish everyone would
just leave me alone.

351
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,000
I don't know what I'm doing.

352
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:41,865
This was something new.

353
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,600
I mean, I always figured girls
knew exactly what they wanted.

354
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,000
They knew, they had a plan.
Or maybe they didn't.

355
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,600
Maybe they were just
as confused as we were.

356
00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:53,800
Isn't that great?

357
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,900
It-it's horrible.

358
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,000
They don't know either.

359
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,000
That means nobody knows.

360
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,200
You mean you really don't know?

361
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
No.

362
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,800
- Well, I'm sorry.
- What for?

363
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,200
I don't know.

364
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,200
As I stood there that cold night,

365
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,700
I realized for the first time
in a long time

366
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,500
that Winnie and I
were feeling the same thing.

367
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,400
We were both
completely miserable.

368
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,200
Kevin.

369
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,500
What?

370
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,500
Knock, knock.

371
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,200
Who's there.

372
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,400
Sam and Janet.

373
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Sam and Janet who?

374
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,100
Sam and Janet Evening.

375
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,400
You're supposed to laugh.

376
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,700
I am.

377
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,200
You are?

378
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,700
Well, maybe
I'm not "laughing" laughing.

379
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,300
But I'm laughing.

380
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,100
Okay, Winnie.
Some enchanted evening.

381
00:19:51,135 --> 00:19:52,700
We'll see.

382
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:17,600
