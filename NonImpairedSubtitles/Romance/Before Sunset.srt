1
00:01:47,557 --> 00:01:50,151
Do you consider the book
to be autobiographical?

2
00:01:51,594 --> 00:01:53,653
Well, I mean...

3
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,663
...isn't everything autobiographical?

4
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:01,293
I mean, we all see the world
through our own tiny keyhole, right?

5
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:03,404
I mean, I always think
of Thomas Wolfe.

6
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:06,871
Have you ever seen that little
one-page "Note to Reader"...

7
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,170
<i>... in the front
of Look Homeward, Angel?</i>

8
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:14,883
Anyway, he says that we are the sum
of all the moments of our lives...

9
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:18,851
...and anybody who sits down to write
will use the clay of their own life...

10
00:02:19,022 --> 00:02:20,546
...that you can't avoid that.

11
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:25,626
So when I look at my own life,
I have to admit, right, that I...

12
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:30,423
I've never been around a bunch of guns
or violence, you know, not really.

13
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:34,569
No political intrigue
or a helicopter crash, right?

14
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:39,266
But my life, from my own point of view,
has been full of drama, right?

15
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,377
And so I thought,
if I could write a book...

16
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:46,982
...that could capture what it's like
to really meet somebody...

17
00:02:47,217 --> 00:02:49,879
One of the most exciting things
that's happened to me...

18
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:52,351
...is to meet somebody,
make that connection.

19
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:56,582
And if I could make that valuable,
you know, to capture that...

20
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,559
...that would be the attempt, or...

21
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,588
Did I answer your question?

22
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:06,601
I'll try to be more specific.

23
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,766
Was there ever a French young woman
on a train you met...

24
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,271
...and spent an evening with?

25
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:19,080
See, to me, that... I mean...

26
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:22,685
...that's not important, you know?
- So that's a yes?

27
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,613
All right, since I'm in France and this
is the last stop of my book tour, yes.

28
00:03:28,424 --> 00:03:30,255
Thank you.

29
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:33,827
Mr. Wallace, the book ends
on an ambiguous note.

30
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:35,328
We don't know.

31
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:38,125
Do you think they get back together
in six months...

32
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:41,768
...like they promise each other?

33
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:44,305
Like they promised?

34
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:48,605
I think how you answer that,
you know, is...

35
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:52,710
It's a good test, right,
if you're a romantic or a cynic.

36
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:56,942
Right? I mean, you think
they get back together, right?

37
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,644
- You don't, for sure.
- No.

38
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,812
And you hope they do,
but you're not sure.

39
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:04,687
- That's why you're asking the question.
- Do you think they get back together?

40
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:07,021
I mean, did you in real life?

41
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,329
Did I in real...?

42
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,294
Look, in the words
of my grandfather, okay:

43
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:16,563
"To answer that would take
the piss out of the whole thing."

44
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:20,965
We just have the time
for one last question.

45
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,872
What is your next book?

46
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:27,972
I don't know, man. I don't know.

47
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:31,675
I've been...
I've been thinking about this...

48
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,550
well, I always kind of wanted
to write a book...

49
00:04:34,724 --> 00:04:38,387
...that all took place
within the space of a pop song.

50
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:41,722
Like three or four minutes long,
the whole thing.

51
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:45,457
The story, the idea,
is that there's this guy, right...

52
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:48,364
...and he's totally depressed.

53
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:52,735
His great dream was to be a lover,
an adventurer, you know...

54
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:55,673
...riding motorcycles
through South America.

55
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,608
And instead he's sitting
at a marble table eating lobster.

56
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:01,875
He's got a good job and
a beautiful wife, right, but that...

57
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,418
Everything that he needs.
But that doesn't matter...

58
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:08,590
...because what he wants
is to fight for meaning.

59
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:11,088
You know? Happiness
is in the doing, right?

60
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:13,592
Not in the getting what you want.

61
00:05:13,796 --> 00:05:17,288
So he's sitting there,
and just that second...

62
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,732
...his little 5-year-old daughter
hops up on the table.

63
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:25,203
And he knows that she should
get down, because she could get hurt.

64
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:30,107
But she's dancing to this pop song
in a summer dress.

65
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,738
And he looks down...

66
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:35,440
...and all of a sudden, he's 16.

67
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:41,746
And his high-school sweetheart
is dropping him off at home.

68
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,485
And they just lost their virginity,
and she loves him...

69
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:49,620
...and the same song is playing
on the car radio.

70
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:52,834
And she climbs up and starts dancing
on the roof of the car.

71
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:54,593
And now he's worried about her.

72
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:59,071
And she's beautiful, with a facial
expression just like his daughter's.

73
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:01,570
In fact, maybe that's why
he even likes her.

74
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,679
You see, he knows he's not
remembering this dance...

75
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:08,611
...he's there. He's there,
in both moments, simultaneously.

76
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:12,254
And just for an instant,
all his life is just folding in on itself.

77
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,151
And it's obvious to him
that time is a lie.

78
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,928
That it's all happening all the time...

79
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:23,657
...and inside every moment
is another moment...

80
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:25,764
...all happening simultaneously.

81
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:29,062
Anyway, that's kind of the idea.
Anyway.

82
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:32,773
Our author has to be going
to the airport soon...

83
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,876
...so thank you all very much
for coming over this afternoon.

84
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:39,343
And a special thanks to Mr. Wallace
for being with us.

85
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:40,981
Thank you. Thank you.

86
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,846
We hope to see you here again
with your next book.

87
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,827
Thank you all. How much longer
before I have to go to the airport?

88
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,623
Oh, you should leave at 7:30...

89
00:06:55,865 --> 00:06:58,390
- Seven-thirty at the very latest.
- Okay.

90
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:06,639
- Hi.
- Hello.

91
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:11,975
- How are you?
- Good, and you?

92
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:16,547
I'm good, yeah, I'm great. I'm...

93
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,685
Do you wanna, maybe,
get a cup of coffee?

94
00:07:20,423 --> 00:07:22,891
Didn't he just say
you have a plane to catch?

95
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:26,861
Yeah. But, I mean, I have a little time.

96
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,529
- Okay.
- Yeah? All right, well, let me...

97
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,826
I'll meet you outside. Okay.

98
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,936
Excuse me. I'm just gonna go
get a cup of coffee.

99
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:39,403
- I'll be back at 7:15.
- Did you sign all these?

100
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:42,203
- Yeah, I sure did.
- Get your driver Philippe's card...

101
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:44,902
...so you can call his cell
if you're running late.

102
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:47,708
We'll put your bags in the car
so you're not late.

103
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:50,442
- All right, thanks for everything.
- Thank you.

104
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:54,756
Which one's Philippe?

105
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:16,041
- I can't believe you're here.
- I live here in Paris.

106
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:20,779
Are you sure you don't have to stay?
You're not supposed to talk more?

107
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:23,042
They're sick of me.
I spent the night here.

108
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,585
- You did?
- Yeah, they got a loft upstairs.

109
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:29,322
- How are you? This is so weird.
- I'm fine.

110
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:33,256
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

111
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:38,065
- So you want to go to a café?
- Yeah.

112
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,633
Okay. There's one a little further
that I like.

113
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:44,705
I thought I was gonna totally lose it
in there when I first saw you.

114
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:46,636
How did you know
I was gonna be here?

115
00:08:46,842 --> 00:08:51,245
It's my favorite bookstore in Paris.
You can sit down for hours and read.

116
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:53,405
I love it. There's fleas,
but, you know...

117
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,949
I know. I think a cat slept
on my head last night.

118
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,746
I saw your picture on the calendar
about a month ago...

119
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,786
...and that you were going
to be here.

120
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:04,125
It's funny, because I read an article
on your book...

121
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:08,286
...and it sounded vaguely familiar.
- Vaguely? Yeah.

122
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:12,498
But I didn't put it all together
until I saw your photo. So...

123
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:14,829
Did you have a chance to read it?

124
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:16,470
Yes, I...

125
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,107
I was really, really surprised,
as you can imagine.

126
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,936
I mean, I had to read it twice, actually.

127
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,169
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

128
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:28,209
No, I liked it. It's very romantic.

129
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:31,046
I usually don't like that,
but it's really well-written.

130
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:34,279
- It's well-written. Congratulations.
- All right. Thank you.

131
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,555
- Wait.
- What?

132
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:40,751
Before we go anywhere,
I have to ask you...

133
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,721
Sure. What?

134
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:45,890
Did you show up in Vienna
that December?

135
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:52,139
- Did you?
- No, I couldn't. But did you?

136
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:55,675
- I need to know. It's important to me.
- Why, if you didn't?

137
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:58,036
Well, did you?

138
00:09:58,214 --> 00:09:59,704
No.

139
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,840
Thank God you didn't.

140
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:04,849
- Oh, my God.
- Thank God you didn't.

141
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:08,546
Thank God I didn't and you didn't.
If one of us had showed up alone...

142
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:11,158
...that would have sucked.
- I was so concerned.

143
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,195
I felt horrible about not being there,
but I couldn't. My grandma died...

144
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:17,662
...and she was buried that day,
December 16th.

145
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,427
- The one in Budapest?
- Yes. You remember that?

146
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,434
- I remember everything.
- Of course, it was in your book.

147
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:26,905
But anyway, I was about to
fly to Vienna, you know...

148
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:31,170
...and we heard the news about her,
and of course I had to go to the funeral.

149
00:10:31,347 --> 00:10:33,076
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.

150
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:37,015
I know. But you weren't there anyway.

151
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,710
Wait. Why weren't you there?

152
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:43,255
I would have been there
if I could have. I made plans...

153
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:45,689
You better have a good reason.

154
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,226
What?

155
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:50,765
Oh, no.

156
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:53,459
No, you were there, weren't you?

157
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:56,365
Oh, no, that's terrible!

158
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,267
I'm laughing, but I don't mean it.

159
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:00,306
Did you hate me?
You must've hated me.

160
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:02,740
- Have you been hating me all this time?
- No.

161
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,243
- Yes, you have.
- No.

162
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:06,278
But you can't hate me now, right?

163
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:09,610
- I mean, my grandma...
- I don't hate you. It's no big deal.

164
00:11:09,852 --> 00:11:12,377
I flew all the way over there,
you blew the thing off.

165
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,648
My life's been a big nosedive since,
but it's not a problem.

166
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:18,724
- No, I'm kidding.
- Don't say that. I can't believe it.

167
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,396
You must have been so angry
with me. I'm so sorry.

168
00:11:21,564 --> 00:11:24,089
I wanted to be there,
more than anything in the world.

169
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,996
- Honestly, I swear...
- You can't be angry, my grandmother...

170
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:30,832
I know. I honestly thought that something
like that might have happened.

171
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:33,099
I was definitely bummed, but...

172
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,972
Mostly I was mad we hadn't exchanged
any phone numbers or any information.

173
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:39,137
That was so stupid.
No way to get in touch.

174
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:41,647
- Nothing to go on.
- I didn't know your last name.

175
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:45,014
Remember, we were both afraid
if we started writing and calling...

176
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:48,748
...that it would slowly fade out.
- It definitely wasn't a slow fade.

177
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:50,152
No, it sure wasn't.

178
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:52,157
We wanted to pick up
where we left off.

179
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:55,695
Which would have been fine
if it had worked. Oh, well.

180
00:11:57,032 --> 00:11:58,590
So...

181
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:02,399
- How long were you in Vienna, then?
- Just a couple days.

182
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:06,100
Did you meet another girl?

183
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,902
Yeah, her name was Gretchen
and she was amazing.

184
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:11,807
The book's really a composite
of the two of you.

185
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:15,814
No, I'm kidding. You wouldn't believe...
I even went back to the train station.

186
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:20,114
I put up signs of my number
in the hotel in case you'd been delayed.

187
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:22,951
- I was a total dork.
- Let's go this way. Did you get any calls?

188
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:26,351
Just a couple hookers
looking for a gig.

189
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:29,122
No, it was awful, I mean,
what do you want me to say?

190
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:30,697
It's so sad. I'm so sorry.

191
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:33,993
I walked around for a couple days.
Eventually, I flew home.

192
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:36,467
I owed my dad 2000 bucks...

193
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,663
...who had warned me
about French chicks.

194
00:12:38,874 --> 00:12:40,739
What did he tell you
about French women?

195
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:43,035
Nothing. He's never met
any French women.

196
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:45,509
He's never been
east of the Mississippi.

197
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:49,913
Why didn't you put, "Six months later,
the French bitch didn't show up"?

198
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:51,677
No, but I did, I did.

199
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:54,822
- You did?
- Yeah. No. I made it more hopeful.

200
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,549
I wrote this fictional version
where you do show up.

201
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,228
- Oh, what happens?
- Well...

202
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,157
what?

203
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:06,558
We make love for about 10 days straight,
that's one part of it.

204
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:09,533
- Interesting. So the French slut, right?
- Yeah, exactly.

205
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:12,229
It's just then they get
to know each other better...

206
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:14,399
...and realize they don't
get along at all.

207
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,909
- I like that. It's more real.
- My editor didn't think that way.

208
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,207
Everyone wants to believe in love.
It sells.

209
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,373
Yeah, exactly, so...

210
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:25,679
So things are going well for you,
right? I mean...

211
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,085
- Your book is a bestseller in the U.S.
- It's a tiny bestseller.

212
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,282
- Oh, come on.
- All right. Officially, yes.

213
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:34,621
<i>Most people haven't read Moby Dick.
Why should they read my book?</i>

214
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:37,061
<i>I haven't read Moby Dick
and I liked your book.</i>

215
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,531
- Thanks.
- Even though...

216
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,499
...I thought you idealized
the night of it.

217
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:44,400
Come on, it's fiction, right?

218
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,234
- I'm supposed to...
- I know, I know.

219
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:49,639
I know. I thought there were times
where you made me...

220
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:54,248
well, I mean, her, right?
No, me. Okay, whatever.

221
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,510
- A little bit neurotic.
- You are a bit like that, aren't you?

222
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,951
- You think I'm neurotic?
- No, no, no. Come on, I'm kidding.

223
00:14:01,123 --> 00:14:02,988
Where did I do that? I didn't do that.

224
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:05,888
Oh, maybe it's just me, you know...

225
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:09,087
Reading something, knowing
the character is based on you...

226
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:11,960
...it's both flattering and disturbing
at the same time.

227
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:13,657
How is it disturbing?

228
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:18,101
I don't know. Just being part
of someone else's memory.

229
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,902
Seeing myself through your eyes.

230
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:23,476
How long did it take you to write it?

231
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,243
Three or four years, on and off.

232
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,611
Wow, that's a really long time
to be writing about one night.

233
00:14:29,818 --> 00:14:32,480
Yeah, I know. Tell me about it.

234
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,256
I always assumed
you had forgotten me.

235
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:38,422
No, I had a pretty clear picture
of you in my mind.

236
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,027
- I have to tell you something. I just...
- what?

237
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:44,996
I've wanted to talk to you for so long
that now... It's just surreal, you know?

238
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,963
I feel like everything should be...

239
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,570
How long do we have?
Twenty minutes and 30 seconds?

240
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:52,070
We got more than that.
I wanna know about you.

241
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:54,868
Tell me, what are you doing?
What are you up to?

242
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:59,706
Where to start? I work for Green cross.
It's an environmental organization.

243
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:01,280
What are they all about?

244
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,043
We basically work on different
environment issues...

245
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:06,847
...from clean water to
disarmament of chemical weapons.

246
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:09,490
International laws that deal
with the environment.

247
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,024
- What do you do for them?
- We're going this way.

248
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:13,792
Different things.

249
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,864
Like, last year I was in India for a while,
working on a water-treatment plant.

250
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:22,000
Well, the cotton industry there
is a major source of pollution, so...

251
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,106
I mean, it sounds like you're actually
doing something.

252
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:28,743
Most people, myself included,
just sit around and bitch.

253
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:33,575
You know, how America's consuming
all the world's resources, SUVs suck...

254
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:35,148
...global warming is real...

255
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,718
I'm relieved to hear you're not one
of those "freedom fries" Americans.

256
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:41,321
Hey, you know...
But how'd you get into that?

257
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,755
I came out of political science,
hoping to work for the government.

258
00:15:44,994 --> 00:15:47,690
- And I did for a little while. Terrible.
- Not good?

259
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:51,525
Yeah, no. Anyway, I got really tired...
Let's go this way.

260
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:54,032
Having this endless conversation
with friends...

261
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,433
...about how the world
was falling to pieces.

262
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:59,072
So I decided what I really
wanted to do was...

263
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:02,641
...to find things that could be fixed
and try to fix them, you know?

264
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:06,576
You know, I always thought you'd be
doing something cool like that. I did.

265
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:11,719
Thanks. I just feel really, really lucky
to be doing a job I like, you know?

266
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,387
Yeah.

267
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:18,288
I actually alternate in between thinking
everything is irrevocably screwed up...

268
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,758
...and things might be
getting better in ways.

269
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:23,397
Better? How could you
possibly say that?

270
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,362
Well, I just mean, you know, like...

271
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:29,197
I know it sounds weird, but there are
things to be optimistic about.

272
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:34,104
Okay... I know your book is selling,
which is great, I'm very happy for you.

273
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:37,574
But let me break the news to you:
The world is a mess right now.

274
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,271
From a western view,
things are getting a bit better.

275
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:44,077
We're moving industry to developing
nations where we can get cheap labor...

276
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:47,551
...free of any environmental laws.
The weapon industry is booming.

277
00:16:47,723 --> 00:16:50,692
Five million people die a year
from preventable water disease.

278
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:53,885
How is the world getting better?
I'm not angry, I'm not angry.

279
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,189
But come on, I want to know.
I'm interested.

280
00:16:56,398 --> 00:16:59,890
I realize that there are a lot
of serious problems in the world.

281
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,332
- Okay. Thank you.
- I mean, I don't even have...

282
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:05,938
...one publisher in the Asian market.
- Okay. All right.

283
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,577
- Say stop.
- What? Stop.

284
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:13,647
Look, all I'm saying is there's more
awareness. People are gonna fight back.

285
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:16,808
The world might be getting better
because people like you...

286
00:17:16,985 --> 00:17:18,612
...are educated and speaking out.

287
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:22,421
Even the very notion of conservation,
environmental issues...

288
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,990
...weren't in the vocabulary
till fairly recently.

289
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,256
And they're becoming the norm and
eventually might be what's expected.

290
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,434
I agree with what you're saying,
but at the same time it's dangerous.

291
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,262
An imperialist country can use
that kind of thinking...

292
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:37,598
...to justify their economic greed.

293
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:43,102
Is there any particular imperialist country
you have in mind, there, Frenchie?

294
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:45,473
- No, not really.
- No?

295
00:17:50,886 --> 00:17:54,378
- So you wanna sit over there?
- Yeah, this is perfect.

296
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,520
Oh, wow. Maybe what I'm saying is...

297
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,661
...the world might be evolving
the way a person evolves.

298
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,855
Like, I mean, me, for example.
Am I getting worse?

299
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:08,230
Am I improving? I don't know.
When I was younger, I was healthier...

300
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:10,894
...but I was wracked with insecurity,
you know?

301
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,633
Now I'm older and my problems
are deeper...

302
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:15,674
...but I'm more equipped
to handle them.

303
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:18,572
So, what are your problems?

304
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:24,643
Right now I don't have any.
I don't, you know? I'm just...

305
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,549
...damn happy to be here.

306
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:28,547
Me too.

307
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,824
So how long have you been in Paris?

308
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,430
I got in last night.
I've done 10 cities in 12 days.

309
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,998
I'm wrecked. I'm so glad it's over,
you know?

310
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,669
I'm tired of being a huckster.

311
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:43,727
- Hi.
- Hello.

312
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:45,429
What do you want?

313
00:18:45,674 --> 00:18:47,608
A cup of coffee.

314
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,111
God, I love this café. I wish they had
places like this in the U.S.

315
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,042
Yeah, I missed cafés
when I was living over there.

316
00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:01,120
I mean, I find a few places
I really liked, but there was...

317
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:05,349
- You were living in the U.S.?
- Yes, from '96 to '99.

318
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,119
I was studying at NYU.

319
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:10,123
Oh, God, don't tell me that, Celine.

320
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:12,390
- What?
- No, it's just...

321
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:14,296
- Nothing, I mean, I...
- what?

322
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:17,870
I've been living in New York since '98.
We were there at the same time.

323
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,598
- In New York?
- Yeah.

324
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:24,474
That's weird. It actually crossed my mind
a few times that I might run into you...

325
00:19:24,646 --> 00:19:26,978
...but the odds are so slim, right? So...

326
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,483
I didn't even know
what city you were in.

327
00:19:29,651 --> 00:19:33,143
- Weren't you somewhere in Texas?
- Yeah, yeah, definitely. I just...

328
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:36,880
I was for a long time. I just,
you know, wanted to try New York.

329
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,588
What brought you back here?

330
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:42,787
I had finished my master's, for one...

331
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:45,228
...and no visa, no more visa.

332
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:49,803
And I was starting to get paranoid.
All the violence in the medias:

333
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:53,237
Gang violence, murders,
especially serial killers...

334
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:56,504
But the final straw was...

335
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:59,612
...one night I heard some noise
on my fire escape...

336
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:02,375
...so I called 911,
and the cops came eventually.

337
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:06,076
- Like three hours later.
- Yeah, after I had been raped and killed.

338
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:09,179
No, but it was a man
and a woman officer.

339
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:11,415
I was explaining what I had heard...

340
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,925
...when the woman had
to go move the police car.

341
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:15,791
I was left alone with the male cop.

342
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:20,424
Right away he asked me if I had a gun,
and I said, "No, of course not."

343
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,503
And he told me, "well, you better
think about getting one.

344
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:27,038
This is America, not France. Okay?"

345
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:30,337
And I said to him, "I have no idea
how to shoot a gun...

346
00:20:30,545 --> 00:20:33,036
...and I have no interest
in firearms whatsoever."

347
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:37,048
And that's when he pulled out his gun,
like this, and he went:

348
00:20:37,286 --> 00:20:42,724
"Well, one day, you're gonna have
something like this in your face...

349
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,323
...and if you wanna have a long life...

350
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:49,694
...you're gonna have to choose
between you or them."

351
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,168
And then they left. And the next morning
I called for an application to get a gun.

352
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,861
Me with a gun.
I mean, that's really scary.

353
00:20:58,073 --> 00:21:00,200
But then I realized
something was wrong.

354
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:03,969
The way that cop had pulled his gun out,
and everything, right?

355
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,010
So I canceled my demand
for the gun...

356
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,309
...and I called the police and tried
to complain about that cop.

357
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:12,044
- What happened with that?
- It was so much paperwork...

358
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,053
...and then I got scared,
with my shitty student visa...

359
00:21:15,223 --> 00:21:17,657
- Thought you'd get deported?
- Exactly. I gave up...

360
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:19,589
...and forgot about the whole thing.

361
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:23,389
- Well, I guess I never forgot.
- Obviously.

362
00:21:23,598 --> 00:21:26,158
But still, you know,
I really enjoyed being there.

363
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,496
- There's lots of things I miss in the U.S.
- Yeah? Like what?

364
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:33,031
Well...

365
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:35,732
The overall good mood
people have there.

366
00:21:35,978 --> 00:21:38,037
Like, even if it can be
bullshit sometimes.

367
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,011
Like, "How you doing?" "Great."
"How you doing?" "Great!"

368
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,543
"Have a great day!"

369
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:47,581
I don't know. Parisians can be
so grumpy. Have you noticed?

370
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:50,417
No, everybody seems
pretty happy to me.

371
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:54,061
- They're not happy. No.
- They're not happy?

372
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:57,596
No, they are. I don't know. I just
mean French men. They drive me nuts.

373
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:59,198
What is it? What about them?

374
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:02,526
Well, they're very nice.
They're great, you know, to be around.

375
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,729
They love food, wine,
they're great cooks.

376
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,897
But I've had really bad luck with them.

377
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,702
Why? What do you mean?

378
00:22:09,544 --> 00:22:12,536
- Well, I guess they're not as...
- what?

379
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,306
What's the word?

380
00:22:15,384 --> 00:22:18,649
- Horny? They're not as horny.
- Horny?

381
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:23,153
Wait, listen to me on this one. In that
regard, I am proud to be an American.

382
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:25,259
And you should be.
In that regard only.

383
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,419
Have you ever spent time
in Eastern Europe?

384
00:22:28,897 --> 00:22:31,388
Eastern... No, I don't.
Thank you.

385
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,994
I remember as a teenager
I went to Warsaw...

386
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,730
...when it was still
a strict communist regime.

387
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,305
- Which I don't approve of at all.
- Sure you don't.

388
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:42,510
- No, I don't.
- I'm just kidding.

389
00:22:42,677 --> 00:22:45,612
But anyway, something about
being there was very interesting.

390
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,012
After a couple of weeks,
something changed in me.

391
00:22:49,184 --> 00:22:52,347
The city was quite gloomy and gray...

392
00:22:52,554 --> 00:22:55,284
...but after a while,
my brain seemed clearer.

393
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,118
I was writing more
in my journal...

394
00:22:57,325 --> 00:23:00,488
...ideas I'd never thought of before...
- communist ideas?

395
00:23:00,695 --> 00:23:02,856
- Listen, I'm not...
- I'm sorry, I...

396
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:04,827
- Okay.
- Go on.

397
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:07,627
Okay. I'll send you to a gulag later.

398
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,261
No. But it took me a while to figure out
why I felt so different.

399
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,102
One day, as I was walking
through the Jewish cemetery...

400
00:23:14,276 --> 00:23:16,176
...I don't know why,
but it occurred to me there...

401
00:23:16,344 --> 00:23:20,212
...I realized that I had spent the last
two weeks away from most of my habits.

402
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:22,373
TV was in a language
I didn't understand...

403
00:23:22,584 --> 00:23:25,314
...there was nothing to buy,
no advertisements anywhere...

404
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,114
...so all I'd been doing was...

405
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:32,022
...walk around, think, and write.
My brain felt like it was at rest...

406
00:23:32,227 --> 00:23:35,822
...free from the consuming frenzy.
It was almost like a natural high.

407
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:40,593
I felt so peaceful inside.
No strange urge to be somewhere else...

408
00:23:40,802 --> 00:23:42,133
...to shop...

409
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,464
It could have seemed
like boredom at first...

410
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:46,402
...but it became very, very soulful.

411
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:48,967
It was interesting, you know?

412
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:52,477
Can you believe it was nine years ago
we were walking around Vienna?

413
00:23:52,981 --> 00:23:56,678
- Nine years? No, that's impossible.
- No, it was. It feels like two months.

414
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:58,819
But it was summer '94.

415
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,320
Do I look any different?

416
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:06,622
I do?

417
00:24:07,395 --> 00:24:08,657
I'd have to see you naked.

418
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,998
- What?
- I know, I'm sorry.

419
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,565
Your hair was different back then.
It was like...

420
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:16,169
- It's the same... Oh, down.
- Yeah, take it down.

421
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:18,067
Down. Okay, it was down. Okay.

422
00:24:18,273 --> 00:24:20,434
Well? Voilà.

423
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,199
So?

424
00:24:24,246 --> 00:24:26,407
Okay, come on. Tell me.

425
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,278
Skinnier, I think. A little thinner.

426
00:24:33,355 --> 00:24:34,879
Did you think I was fat before?

427
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,025
- No...
- Yeah, you thought I was a fatty.

428
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:42,253
No, you thought I was a fatty. You
wrote a book about a fat French girl.

429
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,364
- No, listen.
- Oh, no.

430
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,693
Seriously, all right? You look beautiful.

431
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,893
Do I look any different?

432
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:52,764
No. Not at all.
Actually, you have this line.

433
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:55,408
- I know.
- It's like a scar.

434
00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:00,047
- A scar? Like a gunshot wound?
- No, no, no. I like it. I'm sorry.

435
00:25:01,383 --> 00:25:06,184
I had this funny...
well, horrible dream the other day.

436
00:25:07,222 --> 00:25:11,249
I was having this awful nightmare
that I was 32.

437
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,623
And then I woke up,
and I was 23. So relieved.

438
00:25:14,829 --> 00:25:17,423
And then I woke up for real,
and I was 32.

439
00:25:17,632 --> 00:25:20,100
- Shit, man. It happens.
- Scary.

440
00:25:20,302 --> 00:25:22,964
Time goes faster and faster.
Apparently, it's because...

441
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:26,596
...we don't renew synapses after
our 20s, so it's downhill from then on.

442
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,768
I like getting older, you know?
Life feels...

443
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:34,606
I don't know, it feels more immediate.
Like I can appreciate things more.

444
00:25:35,483 --> 00:25:38,077
No, me too, actually. I really love it.

445
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,317
I was once...

446
00:25:40,522 --> 00:25:41,921
...a drummer in a band.

447
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,717
- You were?
- Yeah. We were pretty good, actually.

448
00:25:44,926 --> 00:25:49,124
But the lead-singer guy, he was just so
obsessed with us getting a record deal.

449
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:52,266
It's all we talked about, thought about,
getting bigger shows.

450
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:55,959
Everything was just focused on
the future all the time. And now...

451
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,002
...the band doesn't even exist anymore.

452
00:25:58,173 --> 00:26:00,539
And looking back
at the shows we did play...

453
00:26:00,742 --> 00:26:03,643
...even rehearsing, it was just
so much fun.

454
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:08,010
I just... Now I'd enjoy every minute of it.
Could I have a drag of that?

455
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:11,309
Well, your book has been published.
That's a pretty big deal.

456
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:14,784
You've been all around Europe.
Are you enjoying every minute of it?

457
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,355
- Not really.
- Not really?

458
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:18,958
No.

459
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,156
- Do you have another one of those?
- Yes, of course.

460
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:25,790
Here.

461
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,796
In my field, I see these people that...
Oh, sorry.

462
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,530
Come into it with big,
idealist visions...

463
00:26:32,707 --> 00:26:35,471
...of becoming the leader
that will create a better world.

464
00:26:35,644 --> 00:26:37,839
They enjoy the goal,
but not the process.

465
00:26:38,046 --> 00:26:39,911
- Right.
- But the reality of it is...

466
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:43,517
...the true work of improving things
is in the little achievements.

467
00:26:43,718 --> 00:26:46,687
- That's what you need to enjoy.
- What do you mean, exactly?

468
00:26:46,888 --> 00:26:50,483
I was working for this organization
that helped villages in Mexico.

469
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:53,650
And their concerns was how
to get the pencils...

470
00:26:53,828 --> 00:26:56,228
...sent to the kid
in those little country schools.

471
00:26:56,398 --> 00:27:00,232
It was not about big,
revolutionary ideas. It was about pencils.

472
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:04,060
I see the people that do the real work,
and what's really sad is that...

473
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:06,999
...the people that are
the most giving, hardworking...

474
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:09,370
...and capable of making
this world better...

475
00:27:09,577 --> 00:27:12,705
...usually don't have the ego
and ambition to be a leader.

476
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:15,542
They don't see any interest
in superficial rewards.

477
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,810
They don't care if their name
ever appear in the press.

478
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,818
They actually enjoy the process
of helping others.

479
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:24,719
- They're in the moment.
- Yeah, but that's so hard...

480
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,794
...you know, to be in the moment.
I mean, I feel like I'm...

481
00:27:27,962 --> 00:27:31,955
...designed to be slightly dissatisfied
with everything, you know?

482
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:34,624
It's like always trying
to better my situation.

483
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:38,305
I satisfy one desire,
and it just agitates another.

484
00:27:38,473 --> 00:27:42,034
And then I think, to hell with it, right?
Desire's the fuel of life.

485
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:45,043
You know? Do you think it's true...

486
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:48,147
...that if we never wanted anything,
we'd never be unhappy?

487
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:53,411
I don't know. Not wanting anything,
isn't that a symptom of depression?

488
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:57,217
Yeah, that is, right?
I mean, it's healthy to desire, right?

489
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:01,054
Yeah. I don't know. It's what all
those Buddhist guys say, right?

490
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,628
Liberate yourself from desire,
and you'll find...

491
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:06,995
...you already have everything you need.
- But I feel alive...

492
00:28:07,235 --> 00:28:09,999
...when I want something more
than basic survival needs.

493
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:13,004
Wanting, whether it's intimacy
with another person...

494
00:28:13,241 --> 00:28:14,970
...or a pair of shoes, is beautiful.

495
00:28:15,176 --> 00:28:18,737
I like that we have those
ever-renewing desires, you know?

496
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,642
Maybe it's this sense
of entitlement.

497
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:24,613
You know, like whenever you feel like
you deserve that new pair of shoes?

498
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:28,687
It's okay to want things, as long as you
aren't pissed off if you don't get them.

499
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,755
Life's hard. It's supposed to be.

500
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,951
If we didn't suffer, we wouldn't
learn a thing, you know?

501
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,264
So, what, are you Buddhist,
or something?

502
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,961
- No.
- No? Why not?

503
00:28:41,403 --> 00:28:46,136
I don't know. The same reason I don't
really consider myself anything, really.

504
00:28:46,508 --> 00:28:49,944
I decided a long time ago that
I was gonna be open to everything...

505
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,636
...but not buy into any one
and only belief system.

506
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:57,410
I went to this Trappist monastery
a couple years ago.

507
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:01,854
- Trappist?
- Yeah, they're catholic. Cistercian.

508
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:05,718
- Why did you do that?
- Why? I'd been doing some reading.

509
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,794
Thought it'd be cool. Have you ever
spent any time with monks or nuns?

510
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:13,464
- No. It's not really my style.
- No?

511
00:29:14,235 --> 00:29:18,296
Well, I expected them to be all
glowering and stern, but they weren't.

512
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:21,066
They were quick to laugh,
really easy to be around.

513
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:24,301
Seriously, very attuned to everything,
they were just...

514
00:29:24,546 --> 00:29:26,980
You know, they weren't trying
to hustle anybody.

515
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,673
They're trying to live and die
in peace with God...

516
00:29:29,884 --> 00:29:32,375
...or whatever part of them
they feel is eternal.

517
00:29:32,587 --> 00:29:34,555
It was just so refreshing to be around.

518
00:29:34,722 --> 00:29:37,213
You realize that most
of the people that you meet...

519
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:39,189
...are trying
to get somewhere better.

520
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,557
They're trying to make more cash,
get a little more respect...

521
00:29:42,764 --> 00:29:45,198
...have more people admire them.
It's exhausting.

522
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,528
- No kidding.
- And it's exhausting to be one yourself.

523
00:29:48,736 --> 00:29:52,103
There I am, right, you know,
all greedy to be more spiritual.

524
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:55,868
"I want to be a better person,"
you know? You can't escape.

525
00:29:56,044 --> 00:30:02,210
I had this boyfriend of mine many years
ago that wanted to be a Buddhist.

526
00:30:02,584 --> 00:30:05,109
So he went to Asia to visit some
of those monasteries.

527
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:09,050
- I've thought about doing that too.
- Yeah, you should. I'll tell you why.

528
00:30:09,257 --> 00:30:12,624
He was good-looking, and each time
he went to one of the monasteries...

529
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:15,422
...a monk offered to suck his cock.

530
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,359
True story.

531
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:20,734
It all comes down to that, doesn't it?

532
00:30:20,935 --> 00:30:23,096
That's why I really admire
what you're doing.

533
00:30:23,304 --> 00:30:25,431
- You know?
- What do you mean? Sucking cock?

534
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,803
- No.
- No? Wrong answer.

535
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:32,776
No, I was gonna say
you're not detached from life.

536
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:35,414
You're putting your passion into action.

537
00:30:35,617 --> 00:30:38,279
Well, I try.

538
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,287
You know something?
I'm gonna be on planes...

539
00:30:42,457 --> 00:30:44,789
...and in an airport
for the next eight hours...

540
00:30:45,026 --> 00:30:47,392
I'd just love to see
a little bit more of Paris.

541
00:30:47,662 --> 00:30:49,129
- Would you walk with me?
- Yeah.

542
00:30:49,297 --> 00:30:50,628
- Do you mind?
- That's great.

543
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:52,766
- Do you want to?
- Let's do that. Yeah.

544
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:54,798
What do we owe here?
Four-fifty?

545
00:30:55,036 --> 00:30:57,561
No, I got it, I got a little
per diem going on here.

546
00:30:57,739 --> 00:30:59,969
- This good, for a tip?
- Yeah, that's fine.

547
00:31:00,174 --> 00:31:02,540
- That's more than enough.
- Throw that in too.

548
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:06,269
- Is there anywhere to go around here?
- It's sales day today.

549
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:09,416
- What's that?
- It's when everything's on sale in Paris.

550
00:31:09,918 --> 00:31:11,317
It's twice a year.

551
00:31:13,821 --> 00:31:15,482
All right, let's go shopping.

552
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:18,785
No, no, no. That's a bad idea.
I don't wanna inflict that on you.

553
00:31:18,993 --> 00:31:22,929
It's madness. Let's just go
to this garden path. It's really nice.

554
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:25,665
All right. That sounds
better than shopping, actually.

555
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:27,960
Not that I wouldn't do
whatever you wanted.

556
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,128
Sometimes I don't even need
to buy anything. I just get high...

557
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,103
...on trying on
and looking at things.

558
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:35,037
Is this where we're going?

559
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:37,473
- Yeah.
- A therapist will tell you that's good.

560
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,011
- Really? Are you ever in therapy?
- Oh, no.

561
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:43,274
- Do I seem like I'm in therapy?
- I'm kidding.

562
00:31:43,685 --> 00:31:47,519
- Does it help your sex problems?
- My sex problems?

563
00:31:47,689 --> 00:31:49,213
- I'm kidding.
- Tell me the truth.

564
00:31:49,457 --> 00:31:51,687
- We didn't have any problems.
- No, I'm kidding.

565
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:54,361
- We didn't even have sex.
- That's a joke, right?

566
00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:57,224
No, we didn't.
I mean, that was the whole thing.

567
00:31:57,398 --> 00:31:59,457
- Of course we did.
- No, no, no, we didn't.

568
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,465
You didn't have a condom
and I never have sex without one.

569
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,535
I'm extremely paranoid.
There's no way...

570
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:07,299
I find it scary that you don't
remember what happened.

571
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:08,840
No, listen...

572
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,706
...I didn't write an entire book,
but I kept a journal...

573
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:15,872
...and I wrote the whole night in it.
That's what I meant, you idealizing it.

574
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,315
All right, listen, I even remember
what brand of condom we used.

575
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:21,387
That's disgusting.
I don't wanna hear it.

576
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:24,116
- That's not disgusting.
- No.

577
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:28,853
Okay, when I get home I'll check my
journal from '94, but I know I'm right.

578
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:33,667
- Wait a minute.
- What?

579
00:32:33,835 --> 00:32:36,565
- Was it in the cemetery?
- No.

580
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:39,171
No, we went to the cemetery
in the afternoon.

581
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,241
It was in the park, very late at night.

582
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:44,771
- In the park?
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

583
00:32:44,946 --> 00:32:46,777
I can't... I can't...

584
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:51,014
Is it that forgettable? You really
don't remember? In the park?

585
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,052
Okay. Wait a minute,
I think you might be right...

586
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:55,586
You're messing with me now.

587
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,189
- No.
- Are you messing with me?

588
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,555
Okay. No, I'm sorry. I think...
I mean, you're right, okay?

589
00:33:00,762 --> 00:33:04,220
Sometimes I put things in drawers
inside my head and forget about it.

590
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:07,094
It's less painful to put things
away than live with it.

591
00:33:07,301 --> 00:33:10,031
What, so that night was, like,
a sad memory for you?

592
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,069
I didn't mean that night
in particular.

593
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,299
I meant certain things
are better forgotten.

594
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:17,033
I remember that night
better than I do entire years.

595
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,042
- Me too.
- Really?

596
00:33:19,213 --> 00:33:21,374
Well, I thought I did.

597
00:33:23,985 --> 00:33:27,648
But maybe I... Maybe I put it away
because of the fact that...

598
00:33:27,822 --> 00:33:30,950
...my grandmother's funeral was
the day we were supposed to meet.

599
00:33:31,192 --> 00:33:34,127
It was a tough day for me,
but it must've been worse for you.

600
00:33:34,328 --> 00:33:38,924
It was unreal. I remember looking
at her dead body in the coffin...

601
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,469
...at her beautiful hands, so warm,
so sweet, that used to hold me...

602
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:47,270
...but nothing in that coffin resembled
what I remembered of her.

603
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,000
All the warmth was gone.

604
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,075
And then I was crying,
so confused if I was crying...

605
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:57,809
...because I was never gonna see her
again or never gonna see you again...

606
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:01,853
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to go on like this.
I've been a little down this week.

607
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:05,082
- Why?
- I don't know. Nothing bad, just...

608
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,261
Reading your book, maybe?

609
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:11,296
No, but... Thinking of how hopeful
I was that summer and fall...

610
00:34:11,499 --> 00:34:13,729
...and since then it's been kind of a...

611
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,701
I don't know.

612
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:20,034
Memory is a wonderful thing if
you don't have to deal with the past.

613
00:34:22,777 --> 00:34:25,610
"Memory is wonderful if you don't
have to deal with the past."

614
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,441
Can I put that
on a bumper sticker?

615
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:30,311
If you wrote a book about our night,
that's a good title.

616
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,353
- And it could be a total different book.
- Yeah, there'd be no sex scenes.

617
00:34:34,956 --> 00:34:36,287
- But you know what?
- What?

618
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,856
Now that we've met again...

619
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:40,687
...we can change our memory
of that December 16.

620
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:44,298
It no longer has that sad ending
of us never seeing each other again.

621
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:48,959
Right. I mean, I guess a memory's
never finished as long as you're alive.

622
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,765
Yeah, I know. I have this memory
from my childhood...

623
00:34:52,974 --> 00:34:55,534
...I realized recently never happened.
- What?

624
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,679
Well, when I was 8 or 9,
my mom was so paranoid...

625
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,713
...when I was walking home
from my piano lesson at night...

626
00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:04,579
...she'd warn me about dirty old men
giving me candies...

627
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:06,583
...and then showing me
their pee-pees.

628
00:35:06,788 --> 00:35:09,848
She was so obsessed with it that,
later in life, you know...

629
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:13,425
...I had this image in my head
that this really happened.

630
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:17,155
To the point that I even associated sex
with that walk home.

631
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:21,028
I mean, and sometimes,
even now, when I'm...

632
00:35:21,903 --> 00:35:25,862
when I'm having sex, I see myself
walking down that street.

633
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,940
I swear. It's so weird, right?

634
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:32,341
- Is that street nearby? I mean, could...?
- Could we? No.

635
00:35:32,513 --> 00:35:34,708
Very far.

636
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,408
Did you ever keep a journal
when you were a kid?

637
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:41,919
Yeah. On and off, I guess.

638
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:44,250
It's funny, I read one of mine...

639
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:46,325
...from '83 the other day.
- Yeah?

640
00:35:46,627 --> 00:35:48,288
And what really surprised me is...

641
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:51,397
...that I was dealing with life
the same way I am now.

642
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,590
I was much more hopeful and naive...

643
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:58,068
...but the core, and the way I was
feeling things, is exactly the same.

644
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,571
It made me realize
I haven't changed much at all.

645
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,231
I don't think anybody does.

646
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,210
People don't want to admit it, but it's
like we have these innate set points...

647
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,975
...and nothing much that happens to us
changes our disposition.

648
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:11,618
- You believe that?
- I think so.

649
00:36:11,786 --> 00:36:15,119
I read this study where they followed
people who'd won the lottery...

650
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:17,154
...and people who'd become paraplegics.

651
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,488
You'd think one extreme is gonna make
you euphoric and the other suicidal.

652
00:36:21,662 --> 00:36:24,392
But the study shows that,
after about six months...

653
00:36:24,565 --> 00:36:27,830
...as soon as people had gotten used to
their new situation...

654
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:30,334
...they were, more or less, the same.
- The same?

655
00:36:30,504 --> 00:36:33,735
Yeah. Like, if they were basically
an optimistic, jovial person...

656
00:36:33,908 --> 00:36:36,741
...they're now an optimistic, jovial
person in a wheelchair.

657
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,912
If they're a petty, miserable asshole...

658
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,016
...they're a petty, miserable asshole
with a new Cadillac, a house and a boat.

659
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:46,517
So I'll be forever depressed
no matter what great things happen?

660
00:36:46,687 --> 00:36:48,086
- Definitely.
- Great.

661
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,951
No, come on, are you depressed now?

662
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,422
No, no, I'm not depressed.

663
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:55,255
But sometimes I worry
I'll get to the end of my life...

664
00:36:55,429 --> 00:36:58,956
...feeling I haven't done all I wanted to.
- Well, what do you want to do?

665
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,828
I...

666
00:37:01,002 --> 00:37:04,028
I want to paint more,
I want to play my guitar every day.

667
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:07,436
I want to learn Chinese.
I want to write more songs.

668
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:11,942
There's so many things I want to do,
and I end up doing not much.

669
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:18,683
All right, well, let me ask you this:
Do you believe in ghosts or spirits?

670
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:20,218
No.

671
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:21,718
- No?
- No.

672
00:37:21,923 --> 00:37:25,654
- Okay, what about reincarnation?
- Not at all.

673
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,794
- God?
- No.

674
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:30,453
- All right.
- That sounds terrible. No, no, no.

675
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:34,533
But I don't want to be one of those
people that don't believe in any magic.

676
00:37:34,702 --> 00:37:36,636
- So then, astrology?
- Yes, of course!

677
00:37:36,804 --> 00:37:38,635
- There we go.
- That makes sense, right?

678
00:37:38,806 --> 00:37:42,207
You're a Scorpio,
I'm a Sag, we get along.

679
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:44,975
No, no, no.

680
00:37:45,146 --> 00:37:48,172
There's an Einstein quote
I really, really like.

681
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,841
He said, "If you don't believe
in any kind of magic or mystery...

682
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,852
...you're basically as good as dead."
- Yeah, I like that.

683
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:58,355
I've always felt there was some kind of
mystical core to the universe.

684
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:03,725
But, more recently, I've started to think
that, me, my personality, whatever...

685
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:06,992
That I don't have any permanent
place here, you know.

686
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:08,829
In eternity or whatever, you know.

687
00:38:09,003 --> 00:38:12,837
And the more I think that, I can't go
through life saying this is no big deal.

688
00:38:13,007 --> 00:38:16,499
This is it. This is actually happening.
What do you think is interesting?

689
00:38:16,677 --> 00:38:18,838
What do you think is funny?
What is important?

690
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,344
You know, every day's our last.

691
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:25,208
When I feel that way, I usually
call my mom to tell her I love her.

692
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,013
- Yeah?
- And she's always:

693
00:38:27,188 --> 00:38:31,284
"Are you okay? Do you have cancer?
Are you gonna commit suicide?"

694
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:34,086
It's almost not worth it.

695
00:38:35,296 --> 00:38:38,094
So, what about us?

696
00:38:38,265 --> 00:38:40,790
- What about us?
- No, what I mean is...

697
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:44,563
...if we were both going to die tonight...
- Like the apocalypse was coming?

698
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:48,869
No, that's too dramatic... But what if
just the two of us were going to die?

699
00:38:49,043 --> 00:38:50,977
I mean, would we talk
about your book?

700
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:53,909
- The environment? Or...
- If today was our last day?

701
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,709
Yeah, what would we talk about?
What would you tell me?

702
00:38:56,884 --> 00:38:58,408
- Well...
- That's hard, huh?

703
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,917
- No, no, I'll do it.
- Okay.

704
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,555
I definitely would
stop talking about my book.

705
00:39:02,723 --> 00:39:05,385
- I would probably drop the environment.
- Okay.

706
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:09,495
But I would still want to talk about,
you know, the magic in the universe.

707
00:39:09,663 --> 00:39:12,894
- I'd just want to do it from a...
- what?

708
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:14,659
...a hotel room, you know...

709
00:39:14,835 --> 00:39:18,635
...in between sessions of us
wildly fucking until we die.

710
00:39:18,806 --> 00:39:21,639
Wow. Well, why waste time
with an hotel room?

711
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:25,245
Why not do it right there on a bench?

712
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,346
Come here, come here, come here.

713
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:30,949
Okay. We're not gonna die tonight.

714
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,143
All right. Too bad. I'm sorry.

715
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,844
That was an extreme example.

716
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:37,490
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

717
00:39:37,658 --> 00:39:39,319
What I... My point was, you know...

718
00:39:39,493 --> 00:39:42,326
...to truly communicate with
people is very hard to do.

719
00:39:42,496 --> 00:39:45,294
No, I know, most of our
day-to-day exchanges...

720
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,990
Yeah, no, I mean...

721
00:39:47,168 --> 00:39:49,796
...not to bring everything back to sex...
- But why not?

722
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,098
No, this example, this friend of mine,
she was talking about...

723
00:39:53,274 --> 00:39:56,300
- She and her boyfriend... Problems in bed.
- Right.

724
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:00,002
And how when they had been dating
for a year she started telling him...

725
00:40:00,181 --> 00:40:03,173
...what he could do to please her more,
and it freaked him out.

726
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,681
- Why?
- Totally.

727
00:40:04,885 --> 00:40:06,876
He thought it meant
he was a bad lover...

728
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:08,953
Maybe she shouldn't have
waited so long.

729
00:40:09,123 --> 00:40:11,489
- After a year...
- But men are so easily offended.

730
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,150
- What, more than women?
- Definitely on that subject.

731
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,693
- You think so?
- Yeah, yeah.

732
00:40:16,464 --> 00:40:18,557
Well, maybe it's because, you know...

733
00:40:18,732 --> 00:40:22,793
...men are easier to... To please.
- To please?

734
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,995
- Well, I don't know.
- Yeah, they are. They're definitely.

735
00:40:26,207 --> 00:40:28,334
Anyway, this friend,
she was telling me...

736
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:32,172
...next time she dates a man,
she's gonna make a little questionnaire...

737
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:35,804
...about what they like and dislike...
- what, written down, or out loud?

738
00:40:35,983 --> 00:40:37,712
Yeah, mostly written down.

739
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:41,548
But it wouldn't be just yes or no.
It would be a bit more complex than that.

740
00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:45,214
Like, for example, if the question is:
"Are you into S & M?"

741
00:40:45,392 --> 00:40:50,227
The answer could be: "No, but a good
spanking once in a while doesn't hurt."

742
00:40:50,397 --> 00:40:54,094
Right, or like:
"Do you like talking dirty in bed?"

743
00:40:54,268 --> 00:40:57,726
- That kind of thing?
- Yeah, but not just like any dirty talk.

744
00:40:57,905 --> 00:41:00,271
Just "what specific word
would you like to hear?"

745
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:01,772
- What, me?
- Well, yeah.

746
00:41:01,942 --> 00:41:04,604
For example what specific word
would you like to hear?

747
00:41:04,778 --> 00:41:06,405
I don't know.

748
00:41:07,915 --> 00:41:10,440
What do you feel about the word
"pussy"?

749
00:41:10,651 --> 00:41:13,415
I love it.

750
00:41:13,787 --> 00:41:15,448
Good.

751
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:18,625
It's amazing what perverts we've
become in the past nine years.

752
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:22,091
At least now we don't have to pretend
each new sexual experience...

753
00:41:22,263 --> 00:41:23,958
...is, like, a life-altering event.

754
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:27,623
I know. By now, you've stuck it in
so many places it's about to fall off.

755
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:31,532
And I can't realistically expect you've
become anything but a total ho.

756
00:41:31,705 --> 00:41:35,106
- Yeah, thank you.
- No, I'm s...

757
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:38,701
- That's true. What can you do?
- What can you do?

758
00:41:38,879 --> 00:41:42,645
So, what kind of songs do you write?
I didn't know you did that.

759
00:41:42,816 --> 00:41:44,044
- What kind?
- Yeah, sure.

760
00:41:44,218 --> 00:41:45,879
- I don't know, just songs.
- Like?

761
00:41:46,053 --> 00:41:48,715
Like, some are about,
you know, people.

762
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:50,550
Relationships. One's about my cat.

763
00:41:50,724 --> 00:41:53,215
- Sing one.
- No, I can't. I don't have a guitar.

764
00:41:53,394 --> 00:41:54,952
- Come on. A cappella.
- No, no, no.

765
00:41:55,129 --> 00:41:58,292
I'm not singing a song without a guitar.
You're nuts.

766
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:00,733
Why not?

767
00:42:00,901 --> 00:42:03,335
- No, okay. Not now. No.
- One.

768
00:42:03,504 --> 00:42:06,769
If not now, when? You want to meet
here in six months with a guitar?

769
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,431
I'll fly all the way over here.

770
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,601
- You may or may not make the Métro.
- Okay, that's funny.

771
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:14,072
- We've got to get back.
- We'll be all right.

772
00:42:14,248 --> 00:42:16,239
- You're gonna miss your flight.
- All right.

773
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:18,248
<i>We can walk down La Seine.
It's nice.</i>

774
00:42:18,419 --> 00:42:19,977
Okay.

775
00:42:20,588 --> 00:42:24,285
- So you're flying back to New York?
- Yeah, yeah.

776
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,119
So I read in that article that
you're married with a kid. That's great.

777
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,788
Yeah, he's... He's 4.

778
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,162
- What's his name?
- Henry. Little Hank.

779
00:42:35,336 --> 00:42:38,134
- He's so much fun.
- Oh, wow, I'm sure.

780
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:41,274
- Your wife, what does she do?
- She teaches elementary school.

781
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,369
- Do you have kids?
- Yes, two... Shit!

782
00:42:44,545 --> 00:42:46,012
- What?
- I left them in the car!

783
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,842
With the windows up, six months ago!
Think they're okay?

784
00:42:49,016 --> 00:42:51,644
No, I'm kidding.
No, but I want to have kids someday.

785
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,684
- I'm just not ready yet.
- No?

786
00:42:53,854 --> 00:42:57,017
- I'm in a good relationship, though.
- Oh yeah? That's good.

787
00:42:57,191 --> 00:42:59,284
- What's he do?
- He's a photojournalist.

788
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,291
He does war coverage.

789
00:43:01,462 --> 00:43:04,022
He's away a lot, which is good
because I'm so busy.

790
00:43:04,198 --> 00:43:08,294
But isn't that dangerous? Aren't a lot of
those guys getting killed these days?

791
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:11,700
He promises me he doesn't take risks,
but I often worry.

792
00:43:11,872 --> 00:43:14,397
He goes in this trance when
he photographs something.

793
00:43:14,575 --> 00:43:17,908
- What do you mean?
- Well, once we were in New Delhi...

794
00:43:18,078 --> 00:43:19,568
...and we passed a bum on the...

795
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,010
- A bomb?
- A bum. A homeless.

796
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,513
All right, right.

797
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:27,518
He looked like he needed help, but his
first reaction was to photograph him.

798
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,521
He went really close to his face,
fixing his collar...

799
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,420
...totally detached from the person.

800
00:43:32,593 --> 00:43:35,357
But don't you have to be like that
to be good at that job?

801
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:36,860
Yeah, I mean, I'm not...

802
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:40,159
I'm not judging him.
What he does is essential and incredible.

803
00:43:40,334 --> 00:43:42,427
All I'm saying is that
I could never do it.

804
00:43:42,603 --> 00:43:44,366
Let's get on that boat. Come on.

805
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,869
- No!
- Come on, it'll be fun.

806
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,372
- You don't have time!
- They're about to take off.

807
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,942
I've got 15 more minutes.
Do you have a cell phone?

808
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:53,443
- Yeah.
- All right, I've got that driver's number.

809
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:55,775
I can call him to pick us up
at the next stop.

810
00:43:55,949 --> 00:43:59,851
I've never been on those boats.
It's for tourists, it's embarrassing.

811
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,351
Okay. All right.

812
00:44:04,758 --> 00:44:06,385
No, I'll get it, I'll get it.

813
00:44:07,194 --> 00:44:09,754
All right. All right, all right.

814
00:44:13,267 --> 00:44:14,598
Thank you.

815
00:44:14,768 --> 00:44:16,929
- So are you in love with that guy?
- What guy?

816
00:44:17,104 --> 00:44:20,437
- The war photographer.
- Yes, of course.

817
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,439
So do you have that cell phone?

818
00:44:26,613 --> 00:44:28,376
Oh, yeah.

819
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:30,380
- Okay, let's see...
- Okay.

820
00:44:30,551 --> 00:44:31,882
What do I tell him?

821
00:44:32,052 --> 00:44:34,247
<i>Tell him to pick you up at
Quai Henri Quatre.</i>

822
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:37,219
<i>Oh, shit. Quai...?</i>

823
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:40,155
<i>Henri Quatre. Quai Henri Quatre.</i>

824
00:44:40,361 --> 00:44:42,386
<i>Henri Quatre.</i>

825
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:45,555
<i>What's wrong with you? No, do you
want me to...? Henri Quatre.</i>

826
00:44:45,733 --> 00:44:47,098
- Henry Four?
- Yes!

827
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:50,259
- Come on, why didn't you say so?
- I'm sorry. Okay.

828
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:04,316
Yeah, is this Philippe?

829
00:45:04,485 --> 00:45:07,147
Yeah. Philippe, this is Jesse Wallace.

830
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:08,686
Yeah.

831
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:13,121
Well, listen, I'm on
one of those boats, right?

832
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:16,194
And we're gonna arrive at Henry Four.

833
00:45:16,397 --> 00:45:19,764
At Port Henry Four.
You know what that is?

834
00:45:19,933 --> 00:45:22,424
All right, great.
And you have my bags, right?

835
00:45:22,603 --> 00:45:25,538
Yeah, so we'll be there in...
I don't know, it's the next stop.

836
00:45:25,706 --> 00:45:28,106
Okay. Au revoir.

837
00:45:29,176 --> 00:45:31,644
- It's okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

838
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,780
Oh, wow.

839
00:45:33,947 --> 00:45:36,643
- Notre Dame, man. Check that out.
- Oh, wow.

840
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:40,810
I heard this story once about when
the Germans were occupying Paris...

841
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,615
...and they had to retreat back.

842
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,724
They wired Notre Dame to blow...

843
00:45:44,925 --> 00:45:49,157
...but they had to leave one guy
in charge of hitting the switch.

844
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:52,389
And the guy, the soldier,
he couldn't do it.

845
00:45:52,566 --> 00:45:56,297
He just sat there, knocked out
by how beautiful the place was.

846
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,335
Then, when the Allied troops
came in...

847
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,997
...they found all the explosives
lying there and the switch unturned...

848
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,839
...and they found the same thing
at the Sacré-Coeur, Eiffel Tower...

849
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,311
...couple other places, I think.

850
00:46:08,482 --> 00:46:10,416
Is that true?

851
00:46:10,584 --> 00:46:13,678
I don't know.
I always liked the story, though.

852
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,219
Yeah, that's a great story.

853
00:46:15,456 --> 00:46:18,323
But you have to think that Notre Dame
will be gone one day.

854
00:46:18,492 --> 00:46:21,655
There used to be another church
at the Seine, right there.

855
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:24,662
- What, right in the same spot?
- Yeah.

856
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:28,567
You know, this is great.
I've never done this.

857
00:46:28,735 --> 00:46:31,363
- Yeah.
- I forget about how beautiful Paris is.

858
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,165
It's not so bad, being a tourist.

859
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,831
- Thanks for getting me on the boat.
- You're welcome.

860
00:46:36,009 --> 00:46:38,910
I think that book that I wrote
was like building something...

861
00:46:39,413 --> 00:46:43,577
...so that I wouldn't forget the details
of the time that we spent together.

862
00:46:43,784 --> 00:46:47,550
You know, like, just as a reminder,
that once, we really did meet.

863
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,690
You know, that this was real,
this happened.

864
00:46:50,858 --> 00:46:52,849
I'm happy you're saying that,
because...

865
00:46:53,026 --> 00:46:57,292
I mean, I always feel like a freak because
I'm never able to move on like this:

866
00:46:58,432 --> 00:47:01,731
People just have an affair,
or even entire relationships...

867
00:47:01,935 --> 00:47:04,301
...they break up and they forget.

868
00:47:04,505 --> 00:47:08,373
They move on like they would have
changed brand of cereals.

869
00:47:09,009 --> 00:47:12,240
I feel I was never able to forget
anyone I've been with...

870
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:17,975
...because each person had their own
specific qualities.

871
00:47:18,151 --> 00:47:23,020
You can never replace anyone.
What is lost is lost.

872
00:47:24,157 --> 00:47:28,321
Each relationship, when it ends,
really damages me. I never fully recover.

873
00:47:28,529 --> 00:47:31,657
That's why I'm very careful
with getting involved...

874
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:33,891
...because it hurts too much.

875
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:37,230
Even getting laid,
I actually don't do that...

876
00:47:37,404 --> 00:47:40,305
...because I will miss of the person
the most mundane things.

877
00:47:40,474 --> 00:47:43,170
Like I'm obsessed with little things.

878
00:47:43,544 --> 00:47:45,842
Maybe I'm crazy,
but when I was a little girl...

879
00:47:46,046 --> 00:47:48,947
...my mom told me
that I was always late to school.

880
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,482
One day she followed me to see why.

881
00:47:51,685 --> 00:47:55,985
I was looking at chestnuts falling from
the trees, rolling on the sidewalk...

882
00:47:56,156 --> 00:48:01,924
...or ants crossing the road, the way
a leaf casts a shadow on a tree trunk.

883
00:48:02,095 --> 00:48:04,120
Little things.

884
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,462
I think it's the same with people.

885
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,868
I see in them little details,
so specific to each of them...

886
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:14,166
...that move me and that I miss
and will always miss.

887
00:48:14,341 --> 00:48:15,831
You can never replace anyone...

888
00:48:16,009 --> 00:48:19,968
...because everyone is made of such
beautiful, specific details.

889
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:26,715
Like, I remember the way your beard
has a bit of red in it...

890
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,149
...and how the sun
was making it glow...

891
00:48:30,357 --> 00:48:33,155
...that morning right before you left.

892
00:48:34,094 --> 00:48:37,996
I remembered that, and I missed it.

893
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,496
Really crazy, right?

894
00:48:40,133 --> 00:48:44,035
Now I know for sure. You wanna
know why I wrote that stupid book?

895
00:48:44,237 --> 00:48:47,172
- Why?
- So you'd come to a reading in Paris...

896
00:48:47,374 --> 00:48:51,538
...and I could walk up to you and ask,
"where the fuck were you?"

897
00:48:51,979 --> 00:48:54,174
No... You think I'd be here today?

898
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:58,876
I'm serious. I think I wrote it,
in a way, to try to find you.

899
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,178
Okay, that's... I know that's not true...

900
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,687
...but that's sweet of you.
- I think it is true.

901
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:06,358
What were the chances
of us ever meeting again?

902
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,357
After that December,
I'd say almost zero.

903
00:49:10,764 --> 00:49:12,823
But we're not real anyway, right?

904
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,197
We're just characters
in that old lady's dream.

905
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,770
She's on her deathbed,
fantasizing about her youth.

906
00:49:18,939 --> 00:49:21,032
So of course we had to meet again.

907
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:25,144
Oh, God. Why weren't you there
in Vienna?

908
00:49:26,279 --> 00:49:30,045
- I told you why.
- I know why, I just...

909
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,447
I wish you would have been.

910
00:49:32,653 --> 00:49:34,883
Our lives might have been
so much different.

911
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,250
You think so?

912
00:49:37,424 --> 00:49:39,051
I actually do.

913
00:49:39,259 --> 00:49:42,387
Maybe not. Maybe we would have
hated each other eventually.

914
00:49:42,596 --> 00:49:45,463
What, like we hate each other now?

915
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,894
You know, maybe we're...
we're only good at brief encounters...

916
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:55,269
...walking around in European cities,
in warm climate.

917
00:49:55,776 --> 00:49:58,904
Oh, God. Why didn't we
exchange phone numbers and stuff?

918
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,240
Why didn't we do that?

919
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,781
Because we were young and stupid.

920
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:06,248
Do you think we still are?

921
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,547
I guess when you're young
you just believe...

922
00:50:08,722 --> 00:50:11,247
...there'll be many people
you'll connect with.

923
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,553
Later in life you realize
it only happens a few times.

924
00:50:14,728 --> 00:50:18,323
And you can screw it up, you know.
Misconnect.

925
00:50:18,565 --> 00:50:20,965
The past is the past.
It was meant to be that way.

926
00:50:21,134 --> 00:50:23,796
You really believe that?
That everything's fated?

927
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:27,963
Well, you know, the world might be
less free than we think.

928
00:50:28,141 --> 00:50:29,836
Yeah?

929
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:34,012
When given these exact circumstances,
that's what will happen every time.

930
00:50:34,214 --> 00:50:37,240
Two part hydrogen, one part oxygen,
you'll get water every time.

931
00:50:37,417 --> 00:50:40,818
No, I mean, what if your grandmother
had lived a week longer, you know?

932
00:50:40,987 --> 00:50:43,615
Or passed away a week earlier?
Days, even?

933
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,348
Things might have been different.

934
00:50:45,525 --> 00:50:49,757
- You can't think like that, it's...
- You shouldn't on most things, but...

935
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:55,129
It's just, on this one, it seemed like
something was off, you know.

936
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:59,366
In the months leading up to my wedding,
I was thinking about you all the time.

937
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:03,373
Even on my way there, I'm in the car, a
buddy of mine is driving me downtown...

938
00:51:03,543 --> 00:51:06,307
...and I'm staring out the window
and I think I see you...

939
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,641
...not far from the church, right...

940
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,306
...folding up an umbrella
and walking into a deli...

941
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:15,114
...on the corner of 13th and Broadway.

942
00:51:15,288 --> 00:51:18,815
And I thought I was going crazy.
But now I think it probably was you.

943
00:51:19,626 --> 00:51:22,254
I lived on 11th and Broadway.

944
00:51:23,029 --> 00:51:24,894
You see?

945
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:29,965
So, what is it like to be married?
You haven't talked much about that.

946
00:51:30,871 --> 00:51:34,398
I haven't? How weird.

947
00:51:34,908 --> 00:51:38,867
I don't know. We met, you know,
when I was in college.

948
00:51:39,045 --> 00:51:45,416
And we broke up and got back together
for a period of years, and then...

949
00:51:46,052 --> 00:51:50,284
what? We were sort of back together
and she was pregnant...

950
00:51:50,924 --> 00:51:52,516
...so marriage.

951
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:54,717
What is she like?

952
00:51:54,895 --> 00:51:57,921
She's a great teacher, a good mom.

953
00:51:58,098 --> 00:52:01,158
She's smart, pretty, you know.

954
00:52:01,334 --> 00:52:03,393
I remember thinking at the time...

955
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:05,936
...that so many of the men
that I admired most...

956
00:52:06,106 --> 00:52:10,941
...that their lives were dedicated to
something greater than themselves.

957
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:14,407
So you got married because
men you admired were married?

958
00:52:14,581 --> 00:52:20,850
No, no. It's more like I had this...
This idea of my best self, you know?

959
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:22,750
And I wanted to pursue that...

960
00:52:22,923 --> 00:52:25,687
...even if it might have been
overriding my honest self.

961
00:52:25,859 --> 00:52:27,258
You know what I'm saying?

962
00:52:27,427 --> 00:52:31,955
In the moment, I remember thinking
it didn't much matter, the who of it all.

963
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:34,690
I mean, that nobody is gonna be
everything to you...

964
00:52:34,868 --> 00:52:37,735
...and that it's just the action
of committing yourself...

965
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:41,396
...you know, meeting
your responsibilities, that matters.

966
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:45,204
I mean, what is love, right,
if it's not respect, trust, admiration?

967
00:52:45,378 --> 00:52:48,438
And I... I felt all those things.

968
00:52:48,615 --> 00:52:51,482
Cut to the present,
and I feel like I'm running a nursery...

969
00:52:51,651 --> 00:52:54,313
...with somebody I used to date,
you know.

970
00:52:54,487 --> 00:52:56,318
I mean, I'm like a monk, you know.

971
00:52:56,489 --> 00:53:01,392
I mean, I've had sex less than 10 times
in the last four years.

972
00:53:01,895 --> 00:53:04,455
- What, what? You laughing at me?
- No.

973
00:53:04,631 --> 00:53:07,464
- It sounds pathetic?
- What monastery do monks have sex...?

974
00:53:07,634 --> 00:53:10,967
Okay, you're right, I'm doing better
than most monks.

975
00:53:11,137 --> 00:53:13,628
But I do, I feel like if somebody
were to touch me...

976
00:53:13,807 --> 00:53:16,002
...I would dissolve into molecules.

977
00:53:16,176 --> 00:53:18,940
Well, we're here. We've gotta go.
Come on.

978
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,977
Shit.

979
00:53:33,493 --> 00:53:36,462
- I'm sorry to hear that, you know.
- What?

980
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,690
You're not that happy
with your marriage.

981
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,528
- This friend of mine, she's a shrink...
- How's she doing?

982
00:53:42,702 --> 00:53:44,294
She's a mess, but...

983
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:47,702
No, she said she's been dealing
with couples that are breaking up...

984
00:53:47,908 --> 00:53:50,035
...for the same reason.
- What reason is that?

985
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:52,974
They all expected, after a few
years of living together...

986
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:55,478
...for the passion, that desire,
to be the same.

987
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,116
- Yeah, right.
- It's impossible.

988
00:53:57,284 --> 00:53:58,615
And thank God...

989
00:53:58,785 --> 00:54:02,516
...we'd end up with aneurysms in that
constant state of excitement, right?

990
00:54:02,689 --> 00:54:04,486
We'd do nothing at all
with our lives.

991
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:08,150
Would you have finished your book
if you were fucking every five minutes?

992
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,922
I might have welcomed the challenge,
I mean...

993
00:54:11,131 --> 00:54:13,861
It's natural for your wife
after the birth of your son...

994
00:54:14,034 --> 00:54:16,662
...to give all her love to the little one.
- Of course.

995
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:19,999
If she was obsessed with sex,
riding you like a wildcat...

996
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,902
That wouldn't make any sense, right?

997
00:54:22,075 --> 00:54:25,670
Everything you're saying makes sense.
It's not about sex.

998
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:28,040
No, I know. It's obvious.

999
00:54:28,214 --> 00:54:29,806
I...

1000
00:54:30,951 --> 00:54:34,148
You know, couples
are so confused lately.

1001
00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:36,585
I think it must be that...

1002
00:54:36,756 --> 00:54:40,715
...men need to feel essential
and they don't anymore.

1003
00:54:40,894 --> 00:54:43,419
It's been imprinted in their head
for so many years...

1004
00:54:43,596 --> 00:54:45,325
...that they had to be the provider.

1005
00:54:45,498 --> 00:54:49,161
Like, I'm a strong, independent woman
in my professional life.

1006
00:54:49,336 --> 00:54:50,860
I don't need a man to feed me...

1007
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:54,370
...but I still need a man to love me
and that I could love.

1008
00:54:55,742 --> 00:54:58,404
- So your driver's here.
- Yeah.

1009
00:54:58,611 --> 00:55:00,272
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

1010
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,107
- You better give me your...
- No, no.

1011
00:55:02,282 --> 00:55:04,512
Why don't we just
give you a ride home?

1012
00:55:04,684 --> 00:55:07,016
- Well, I can take the Métro. I'm fine.
- No, I...

1013
00:55:07,187 --> 00:55:10,122
My flight's not until 10.
I'll be arriving two hours early.

1014
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:11,723
This way we can keep talking.

1015
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:14,018
- Monsieur, can...?
- It's not on the way.

1016
00:55:28,775 --> 00:55:30,709
You told him where you are
and all that?

1017
00:55:30,877 --> 00:55:32,504
Yeah.

1018
00:55:35,815 --> 00:55:38,283
- He knows where he's going?
- Yes.

1019
00:55:38,451 --> 00:55:40,316
Glad somebody does.

1020
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,616
- But this is better than the Métro, right?
- Definitely.

1021
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:51,463
I was thinking, for me it's better I don't
romanticize things as much anymore.

1022
00:55:51,631 --> 00:55:53,496
I was suffering so much all the time.

1023
00:55:53,666 --> 00:55:57,158
I still have lots of dreams,
but they're not in regard to my love life.

1024
00:55:57,404 --> 00:55:59,770
It doesn't make me sad,
it's just the way it is.

1025
00:55:59,973 --> 00:56:04,103
Is that why you're in a relationship
with somebody who's never around?

1026
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:08,179
Yes, obviously I can't deal with
the day-to-day life of a relationship.

1027
00:56:08,348 --> 00:56:10,441
Yeah, we have this
exciting time together...

1028
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,984
...and he leaves and I miss him,
but at least I'm not dying inside.

1029
00:56:14,154 --> 00:56:16,588
When someone's always around me,
I'm suffocating.

1030
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,657
No, wait, you just said
that you need to love and be loved.

1031
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:22,692
Yeah, but when I do,
it quickly makes me nauseous.

1032
00:56:22,862 --> 00:56:24,329
It's a disaster.

1033
00:56:24,497 --> 00:56:27,159
I mean, I'm really happy
only when I'm on my own.

1034
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:32,202
Even being alone, it's better than sitting
next to a lover and feeling lonely.

1035
00:56:32,872 --> 00:56:34,806
It's not so easy for me
to be a romantic.

1036
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:38,466
You start off that way, and after
you've been screwed over a few times...

1037
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:42,979
...you forget about your delusional ideas
and you take what comes into your life.

1038
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,141
That's not even true.
I haven't been screwed over...

1039
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,719
...I've just had too many
blah relationships.

1040
00:56:48,888 --> 00:56:50,719
They weren't mean,
they cared for me...

1041
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:54,382
...but there were no real connection
or excitement.

1042
00:56:54,594 --> 00:56:56,721
At least, not from my side.

1043
00:56:56,896 --> 00:56:59,558
God, I'm sorry, is it really that bad?

1044
00:56:59,732 --> 00:57:01,791
It's not, right?

1045
00:57:03,036 --> 00:57:05,800
You know, it's not even that.
I was...

1046
00:57:05,972 --> 00:57:09,135
I was fine until I read
your fucking book.

1047
00:57:09,642 --> 00:57:11,303
It stirred shit up, you know?

1048
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,306
It reminded me how
genuinely romantic I was...

1049
00:57:14,481 --> 00:57:16,642
...how I had so much hope in things...

1050
00:57:16,816 --> 00:57:20,343
...and now it's like I don't believe
in anything that relates to love.

1051
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,511
I don't feel things for people anymore.

1052
00:57:23,656 --> 00:57:27,319
In a way, I put all my romanticism
into that one night...

1053
00:57:27,494 --> 00:57:29,985
...and I was never able to feel
all this again.

1054
00:57:30,163 --> 00:57:32,688
Like, somehow this night
took things away from me...

1055
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,266
...and I expressed them to you,
and you took them with you.

1056
00:57:35,435 --> 00:57:37,335
It made me feel cold,
like love wasn't for me.

1057
00:57:37,504 --> 00:57:40,234
I don't believe that.
I don't believe that.

1058
00:57:41,508 --> 00:57:45,740
You know what? Reality and love
are almost contradictory for me.

1059
00:57:45,912 --> 00:57:50,212
It's funny, every single of my exes,
they're now married.

1060
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:53,284
Men go out with me, we break up,
and then they get married.

1061
00:57:53,453 --> 00:57:56,945
And later they call me to thank me
for teaching them what love is...

1062
00:57:57,157 --> 00:57:59,625
...and that I taught them to care
and respect women.

1063
00:57:59,792 --> 00:58:02,192
- I think I'm one of those.
- I want to kill them!

1064
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:06,024
Why didn't they ask me? I would have
said no, but they could have asked!

1065
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:09,965
I know it's my fault because
I never felt it was the right man.

1066
00:58:10,203 --> 00:58:13,400
Never. But what does it mean,
the right man, the love of your life?

1067
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:16,906
The concept is absurd. We can only be
complete with another person.

1068
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:19,476
- It's evil, right?
- Can I talk?

1069
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:23,080
I guess I've been heartbroken
too many times and then I recovered.

1070
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,877
So now, you know, from the starts,
I make no effort.

1071
00:58:26,052 --> 00:58:28,816
- I know it's not gonna work out.
- You can't do that.

1072
00:58:29,055 --> 00:58:30,920
You can't live trying to avoid pain...

1073
00:58:31,124 --> 00:58:32,921
...at the expense...
- Those are words.

1074
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,559
I've gotta get away from you.

1075
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,888
- Stop the car, I wanna get out.
- No, don't...

1076
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:38,961
- Keep talking.
- It's being around you.

1077
00:58:39,132 --> 00:58:41,498
Don't touch me, you know.
I want to get on a cab.

1078
00:58:44,237 --> 00:58:46,637
No, don't. No, no, keep going.

1079
00:58:46,806 --> 00:58:50,401
Listen, I'm just so happy...
Thank you, just keep going.

1080
00:58:50,577 --> 00:58:52,272
All right.

1081
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:57,344
Look, I'm just so happy,
all right, to be with you.

1082
00:58:57,517 --> 00:59:00,918
I am. I'm so glad you didn't
forget about me, okay?

1083
00:59:01,087 --> 00:59:03,783
No, I didn't.
And it pisses me off, okay?

1084
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:07,653
You come here to Paris,
all romantic, and married.

1085
00:59:07,827 --> 00:59:09,294
Okay? Screw you.

1086
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:12,495
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not trying to get you.

1087
00:59:12,665 --> 00:59:15,133
I mean, all I need is a married man.

1088
00:59:15,768 --> 00:59:19,101
There's been so much water under
the bridge, it's not even about you.

1089
00:59:19,272 --> 00:59:21,740
It's about that moment in time
that's forever gone.

1090
00:59:21,941 --> 00:59:24,842
You say that, but you didn't
even remember having sex, so...

1091
00:59:25,011 --> 00:59:27,878
Of course I remembered.

1092
00:59:29,015 --> 00:59:31,449
- You did?
- Yes.

1093
00:59:31,618 --> 00:59:34,985
- Women pretend things like that.
- They do?

1094
00:59:35,188 --> 00:59:39,147
What was I supposed to say?
That I remember the wine in the park...

1095
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:42,817
...and us looking up at the stars fading
away as the sun came up?

1096
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:46,363
We had sex twice, you idiot!

1097
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:51,533
All right, you know what,
I'm just happy to see you.

1098
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:55,172
Even if you've become an angry,
manic-depressive activist...

1099
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:58,833
...I still like you,
I still enjoy being around you.

1100
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:03,881
And I feel the same. I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened, I just...

1101
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:06,518
- I had to let it all out.
- Don't worry about it.

1102
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,314
I'm so miserable in my love life,
in my relationship.

1103
01:00:09,489 --> 01:00:12,652
I always act as...
Like, you know, I'm detached.

1104
01:00:12,825 --> 01:00:15,988
But I'm dying inside.
I'm dying because I'm so numb.

1105
01:00:16,162 --> 01:00:19,893
I don't feel pain or excitement,
I'm not even bitter, I'm just...

1106
01:00:20,066 --> 01:00:22,728
You think you're the one
dying inside?

1107
01:00:22,902 --> 01:00:27,100
My life is 24/7 bad.

1108
01:00:27,307 --> 01:00:28,604
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

1109
01:00:28,808 --> 01:00:31,709
I mean, the only happiness I get
is when I'm out with my son.

1110
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,539
I've been to marriage counseling...

1111
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,341
...I've done things I never thought
I would have to do.

1112
01:00:36,516 --> 01:00:39,451
I've lit candles,
bought self-help books, lingerie.

1113
01:00:39,619 --> 01:00:42,019
- Did the candles help?
- Hell, no.

1114
01:00:42,188 --> 01:00:44,679
I don't love her the way
she needs to be loved...

1115
01:00:44,857 --> 01:00:49,294
...and I don't even see a future for us,
but then I look at my little boy...

1116
01:00:49,462 --> 01:00:52,863
...sitting across from me,
and I think I'd suffer any torture...

1117
01:00:53,032 --> 01:00:55,398
...to be with him for
all the minutes of his life.

1118
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:57,433
I don't want to miss out on one.

1119
01:00:57,603 --> 01:01:01,937
But then, there's no joy or laughter
in my home, you know?

1120
01:01:02,108 --> 01:01:05,805
- I don't want him growing up in that.
- No laughter? That's terrible.

1121
01:01:05,978 --> 01:01:07,912
My parents have been
together 35 years...

1122
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,413
...and even when they fight
they end up laughing.

1123
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:14,383
I don't want to be one of those people
who are getting divorced at 52...

1124
01:01:14,554 --> 01:01:18,957
...and falling down into tears, admitting
they never really loved their spouse...

1125
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:24,153
...and they feel their life has been
sucked up into a vacuum cleaner.

1126
01:01:24,397 --> 01:01:27,958
You know, I want a great life.
I want her to have a great life...

1127
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:30,362
...she deserves that.

1128
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:33,903
But we're just living in the pretense
of a marriage, responsibility...

1129
01:01:34,073 --> 01:01:38,066
...you know, all these ideas
of how people are supposed to live.

1130
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:43,647
But then I... I have these dreams...

1131
01:01:45,151 --> 01:01:46,516
what dreams?

1132
01:01:46,686 --> 01:01:50,178
I have these dreams,
you know, that...

1133
01:01:50,656 --> 01:01:52,647
...I'm standing on a platform...

1134
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,088
...and you keep going by on a train...

1135
01:01:57,263 --> 01:02:01,666
...and you go by, and you go by,
and you go by, you go by.

1136
01:02:01,834 --> 01:02:03,699
And I wake up with
the fucking sweats.

1137
01:02:03,903 --> 01:02:06,167
And then I have this other dream...

1138
01:02:06,406 --> 01:02:10,206
...where you're pregnant in bed
beside me naked...

1139
01:02:10,443 --> 01:02:14,209
...and I want so badly to touch you, but
you tell me not to and you look away.

1140
01:02:14,414 --> 01:02:18,874
And I... And I touch you anyway...

1141
01:02:19,051 --> 01:02:23,511
...right on your ankle, and your skin is
so soft that I wake up in sobs, all right?

1142
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:27,726
My wife is there looking at me,
and I feel I'm a million miles from her.

1143
01:02:27,927 --> 01:02:31,954
And I know that there's
something wrong, that I...

1144
01:02:32,131 --> 01:02:34,122
God, that I can't keep living like this...

1145
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:36,825
...that there's gotta be more to love
than commitment.

1146
01:02:37,036 --> 01:02:39,834
But then I think that
I might have given up...

1147
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,906
...on the whole idea of romantic love.

1148
01:02:42,074 --> 01:02:45,373
That I might have put it
to bed that...

1149
01:02:45,545 --> 01:02:48,309
That day when you weren't there.

1150
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:51,211
You know, I think I might
have done that.

1151
01:02:52,485 --> 01:02:54,680
Why are you telling me all this?

1152
01:02:55,555 --> 01:02:59,753
I'm sorry. I don't know.
I'm... I should...

1153
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,894
I shouldn't have.

1154
01:03:03,062 --> 01:03:04,654
You know, it's so weird.

1155
01:03:04,831 --> 01:03:08,858
People think they are the only one
going through tough times.

1156
01:03:09,068 --> 01:03:13,368
I mean, when I read the article,
I thought your life was perfect.

1157
01:03:13,673 --> 01:03:17,575
A wife, a kid, published author.

1158
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:21,578
But your personal life
is more of a mess than mine.

1159
01:03:21,747 --> 01:03:24,079
I'm sorry.

1160
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:27,378
Well, I'm glad it's good for something.

1161
01:03:30,089 --> 01:03:33,354
- This is where you live?
- Yeah.

1162
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:38,424
So you're just relieved that I'm
in even more deep shit than you are?

1163
01:03:38,598 --> 01:03:40,463
Yes, you've made me feel better.

1164
01:03:40,633 --> 01:03:42,794
Oh, good, I'm glad.

1165
01:03:43,002 --> 01:03:45,436
No, I really wish you the best.

1166
01:03:45,605 --> 01:03:49,268
It's not because I'm incapable of having
a good relationship or a family...

1167
01:03:49,442 --> 01:03:51,569
...that I wish everyone to be
doomed like me.

1168
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:54,110
I'm sure you'd make... Be
a great mom someday.

1169
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,770
- Really? You think so?
- Yeah...

1170
01:03:55,948 --> 01:03:59,076
...a few antidepressants, you know,
you'll do great.

1171
01:03:59,886 --> 01:04:02,719
- Okay, say stop.
- Stop.

1172
01:04:03,155 --> 01:04:05,885
- Okay.
- You ready? Okay.

1173
01:04:16,035 --> 01:04:20,233
- So I want to try something.
- What?

1174
01:04:22,675 --> 01:04:27,044
I want to see if you stay together
or if you dissolve into molecules.

1175
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,014
How am I doing?

1176
01:04:30,182 --> 01:04:32,116
Still here.

1177
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,446
Good. I like being here.

1178
01:04:38,324 --> 01:04:39,916
Is this your apartment?

1179
01:04:40,092 --> 01:04:41,787
No, I live down there.

1180
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:44,191
- Down there?
- Yeah.

1181
01:04:44,363 --> 01:04:46,854
Monsieur, I'm gonna walk her
to her door.

1182
01:04:55,942 --> 01:04:57,273
This is incredible.

1183
01:04:57,443 --> 01:05:00,139
- This is where you live?
- Yeah.

1184
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:03,510
- How long have you been here?
- Four years.

1185
01:05:05,084 --> 01:05:07,211
- So tell me...
- what?

1186
01:05:07,386 --> 01:05:09,047
Is it all true about your dreams...

1187
01:05:09,221 --> 01:05:11,985
...or did you say that to hopefully
get in my pants?

1188
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:13,716
I said that to get in your pants.

1189
01:05:13,893 --> 01:05:16,384
- I use that all the time.
- Oh, okay. Does it work?

1190
01:05:16,629 --> 01:05:19,496
You know. Sometimes.

1191
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:24,158
Here's my kitty. Oh, so cute.
Look at him.

1192
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,168
You know what I love
about this cat?

1193
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,637
Every morning I bring him
to the courtyard...

1194
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:33,540
...and every single morning he looks
at everything like it was the first time.

1195
01:05:33,713 --> 01:05:37,809
Every corner, every tree, every plant.

1196
01:05:37,984 --> 01:05:40,418
Smells everything
with his little cute nose.

1197
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:44,681
Oh, I love my kitty. I love my kitty.

1198
01:05:45,925 --> 01:05:47,825
- What's his name?
- Che.

1199
01:05:48,494 --> 01:05:50,359
Che?

1200
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,431
- What?
- Commie.

1201
01:05:55,901 --> 01:05:58,893
No, "che" in Argentina means "hey."

1202
01:05:59,071 --> 01:06:01,505
- Okay.
- Yes.

1203
01:06:01,674 --> 01:06:05,405
Oh, baby. Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1204
01:06:08,748 --> 01:06:12,582
We're having a little party.
It's so much fun.

1205
01:06:22,762 --> 01:06:24,593
- So...
- So.

1206
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:45,240
You know what? I was thinking,
would you play me one of your songs?

1207
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,579
- You're gonna miss your flight.
- I won't.

1208
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:50,654
I'm gonna be in the airport for
over an hour, reading...

1209
01:06:50,823 --> 01:06:53,758
...wishing you'd played me
one of your songs.

1210
01:06:53,959 --> 01:06:56,154
One song? Okay, but quickly.

1211
01:06:56,328 --> 01:06:58,125
Okay.

1212
01:07:03,469 --> 01:07:06,700
God, I love these old staircases.

1213
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:47,275
- Hold this.
- What, for me?

1214
01:07:47,446 --> 01:07:49,471
Hey there, buddy.

1215
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:52,642
Che.

1216
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:07,896
- Would you like some tea?
- Yeah, sure.

1217
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,027
Wow.

1218
01:08:11,036 --> 01:08:14,528
- Is chamomile okay?
- Yeah. Great.

1219
01:08:14,707 --> 01:08:16,971
<i>- Merci.
- Messy?</i>

1220
01:08:17,143 --> 01:08:20,874
<i>- You think my apartment is messy?
- No, no. Merci.</i>

1221
01:08:21,046 --> 01:08:24,573
<i>- Merci beaucoup.
- Ah, merci.</i>

1222
01:08:24,784 --> 01:08:28,515
I meant to tell you,
your French has improved a lot.

1223
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:30,018
- Really?
- Yeah.

1224
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:32,783
Yeah, you've really
mastered the language.

1225
01:08:33,559 --> 01:08:36,687
All right, all right, what song
are you gonna play me?

1226
01:08:38,898 --> 01:08:41,833
No, I can't. It's too embarrassing.
It's been...

1227
01:08:42,001 --> 01:08:45,698
whoa. No way. No way. I came up here,
you cannot crap out on me now.

1228
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:47,896
One song. Anything will be great.

1229
01:08:48,107 --> 01:08:49,904
But listen, you're gonna laugh at me.

1230
01:08:50,075 --> 01:08:51,565
- You think so?
- Yes.

1231
01:08:51,811 --> 01:08:53,802
I doubt it.

1232
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:57,948
Okay.

1233
01:08:58,117 --> 01:09:00,517
What do you want to hear? I have...

1234
01:09:00,686 --> 01:09:03,018
I have three songs in English.

1235
01:09:03,189 --> 01:09:04,554
One's about my cat...

1236
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:08,784
...one's about my ex-boyfriend...
well, ex-ex-boyfriend...

1237
01:09:08,961 --> 01:09:11,452
...and there's one about...

1238
01:09:11,864 --> 01:09:15,231
well, it's just a little waltz.

1239
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,528
A waltz? Yeah.

1240
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:19,863
- Play the waltz.
- Right.

1241
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:22,472
I haven't played it in a while.
You sure?

1242
01:09:25,845 --> 01:09:27,369
Okay.

1243
01:09:28,113 --> 01:09:30,411
All right, the waltz.

1244
01:09:42,628 --> 01:09:47,122
<i>Let me sing you a waltz</i>

1245
01:09:47,299 --> 01:09:52,066
<i>Out of nowhere, out of my thoughts</i>

1246
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:56,766
<i>Let me sing you a waltz</i>

1247
01:09:56,942 --> 01:10:00,810
<i>About this one-night stand</i>

1248
01:10:01,914 --> 01:10:07,614
<i>You were, for me, that night</i>

1249
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:13,691
<i>Everything I always dreamt of in life</i>

1250
01:10:13,893 --> 01:10:17,420
<i>But now you're gone</i>

1251
01:10:17,596 --> 01:10:21,828
<i>You are far-gone</i>

1252
01:10:22,835 --> 01:10:27,499
<i>All the way to your island of rain</i>

1253
01:10:27,673 --> 01:10:33,543
<i>It was, for you, just a one-night thing</i>

1254
01:10:33,712 --> 01:10:36,681
<i>But you were much more to me</i>

1255
01:10:36,916 --> 01:10:39,612
<i>Just so you know</i>

1256
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:43,645
<i>I don't care what they say</i>

1257
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:48,782
<i>I know what you meant
For me that day</i>

1258
01:10:48,961 --> 01:10:53,796
<i>I just want another try</i>

1259
01:10:53,966 --> 01:10:58,960
<i>I just want another night</i>

1260
01:11:00,205 --> 01:11:06,166
<i>Even if it doesn't seem quite right</i>

1261
01:11:06,378 --> 01:11:10,371
<i>You meant, for me, much more</i>

1262
01:11:10,549 --> 01:11:14,883
<i>Than anyone I've met before</i>

1263
01:11:15,054 --> 01:11:21,391
<i>One single night with you, little Jesse</i>

1264
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:26,691
<i>Is worth a thousand with anybody</i>

1265
01:11:27,733 --> 01:11:31,100
<i>I have no bitterness, my sweet</i>

1266
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:36,533
<i>I'll never forget this one-night thing</i>

1267
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:42,841
<i>Even tomorrow, in other arms</i>

1268
01:11:43,015 --> 01:11:49,045
<i>My heart will stay yours until I die</i>

1269
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:58,026
<i>Let me sing you a waltz</i>

1270
01:11:58,197 --> 01:12:03,225
<i>Out of nowhere, out of my blues</i>

1271
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:08,362
<i>Let me sing you a waltz</i>

1272
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:13,739
<i>About this lovely one-night stand</i>

1273
01:12:30,829 --> 01:12:34,458
- No, one more! Please, please.
- No! It was our deal.

1274
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:37,134
One... One song. No, no, no.

1275
01:12:37,336 --> 01:12:39,896
You can have your tea and then...

1276
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:47,676
- All right, let me ask you one question.
- What?

1277
01:12:47,846 --> 01:12:51,145
Do you just plug that name in
for every guy that comes up here?

1278
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:53,081
Yes, of course.

1279
01:12:53,252 --> 01:12:57,313
What do you think, that I wrote
the song about you? Are you nuts?

1280
01:13:01,693 --> 01:13:04,093
Is this you? Little cross-eyed Celine?

1281
01:13:04,263 --> 01:13:06,823
- Yes. That's funny.
- Cute.

1282
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,636
- Is that your grandmother?
- Yeah.

1283
01:13:13,372 --> 01:13:15,465
Oh, wow.

1284
01:13:15,841 --> 01:13:18,935
- You want some honey?
- Yeah, sure.

1285
01:14:08,627 --> 01:14:10,925
Did you ever see Nina Simone
in concert?

1286
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:13,655
No, I never did.
I can't believe she's gone.

1287
01:14:13,999 --> 01:14:15,489
I know, it's so sad.

1288
01:14:16,635 --> 01:14:18,068
Thanks.

1289
01:14:18,237 --> 01:14:20,228
It's hot.

1290
01:14:22,341 --> 01:14:25,174
I saw her twice in concert.

1291
01:14:25,777 --> 01:14:28,075
She was so great.

1292
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:31,272
That's one of my favorite songs of hers.

1293
01:14:47,166 --> 01:14:48,463
She was so great.

1294
01:14:50,402 --> 01:14:52,700
She was so funny in concert too.

1295
01:14:52,871 --> 01:14:57,035
She would... She would be
right in the middle of a song and then...

1296
01:14:57,209 --> 01:14:59,074
...you know, stop...

1297
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:03,305
...and walk from the piano all the way
to the edge of the stage.

1298
01:15:03,482 --> 01:15:05,814
Like, really slowly.

1299
01:15:08,787 --> 01:15:12,086
And she'd start talking to someone
in the audience.

1300
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:15,624
"Oh, yeah, baby. Oh, yeah.

1301
01:15:16,395 --> 01:15:18,625
I love you too."

1302
01:15:19,064 --> 01:15:23,501
And then she'd walk back.
Take her time, no hurry, you know.

1303
01:15:23,702 --> 01:15:27,160
She had that big, cute ass.

1304
01:15:27,339 --> 01:15:28,897
She would move.

1305
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:35,444
And then she would go back to the piano
and play some more, you know.

1306
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,610
And then she would, I don't know...

1307
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:41,275
...just start another song
in the middle of another.

1308
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:45,253
You know, like,
stop again, and be like:

1309
01:15:45,424 --> 01:15:49,417
"You over there,
can you move that fan.

1310
01:15:50,329 --> 01:15:52,456
You're cute.

1311
01:16:13,485 --> 01:16:15,476
Oh, yeah."

1312
01:16:19,024 --> 01:16:23,324
Baby, you are gonna miss that plane.

1313
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:26,530
I know.
