It just stole my damn quarter, sweetheart.

00:29:03,562 --> 00:29:07,274
Don't worry about it. I think she got
the flu or somethin', you know?

313
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:09,443
She'll be in tomorrow.

314
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,458
Hey. Here you go now. Merry Christmas.

315
00:29:25,793 --> 00:29:29,255
- And what would you like for Christmas?
- A dollhouse.

316
00:29:31,632 --> 00:29:35,094
We'll see you Christmas Day.
Merry Christmas.

317
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:36,971
What would you like?

318
00:30:17,428 --> 00:30:19,472
OK, I'll see you later.

319
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:23,934
Michael, don't forget. Pick me up at two.

320
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:26,979
- Two? AM?
- Yeah.

321
00:30:27,104 --> 00:30:29,148
I have to get up for school in the morning.

322
00:30:29,273 --> 00:30:34,236
You wanted the car tonight. Don't make
me wake up Daddy, because I'll kill you!

323
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,864
<i>(tyres screech)</i>

324
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:50,044
Hey, Caroline.

325
00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:52,213
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

326
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:56,050
Hi, Caroline. Where you been?

327
00:30:56,175 --> 00:30:58,219
Been all over.

328
00:31:16,487 --> 00:31:19,740
Hey, you missed all the action
in here last night.

329
00:31:19,865 --> 00:31:20,866
What did I miss?

330
00:31:20,991 --> 00:31:24,286
Well, you remember
Bobby Las Vegas, don't you?

331
00:31:24,411 --> 00:31:28,040
- With the motorcycle?
- He don't ride the motorcycle no more.

332
00:31:28,165 --> 00:31:29,291
Yeah? What happened?

333
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:32,920
He slid on a dead squirrel
goin' around a turn over by Frogtown.

334
00:31:33,045 --> 00:31:35,256
- Demolished the bike.
- Jesus!

335
00:31:36,465 --> 00:31:40,136
- He was in here last night.
- He got drunk as a dog down the street.

336
00:31:40,261 --> 00:31:44,640
He tried to run through the Lowry Hill
Tunnel, but passed out cos of the fumes.

337
00:31:44,765 --> 00:31:49,895
So they brought him in here. He was
in the bathroom throwin' up all night.

338
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,941
- Gee, I'm really sorry I missed that.
- Yeah, only Bobby, huh?

339
00:31:57,361 --> 00:31:59,488
So, Caroline, those two guys, you know,

340
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:03,451
the ones that were bothering with
the machine the other night last week?

341
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:07,079
- Yeah?
- Jim seen one of 'em over at St Vincent's.

342
00:32:07,204 --> 00:32:11,333
I went down there to see my cousin Lucy.
She had that thing with her wrist.

343
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:14,670
Yeah, they had to operate.
Anyway, I see him out in the hallway.

344
00:32:14,795 --> 00:32:18,632
Man, was he worked!
His face was a mess.

345
00:32:18,757 --> 00:32:23,596
Black eyes, bumps, bruises.
Looked like he was hit by a dump truck.

346
00:32:23,721 --> 00:32:26,307
I gotta pick up Lucy on Tuesday.

347
00:32:26,432 --> 00:32:28,225
Come here.

348
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,853
You've been following me home?

349
00:32:30,978 --> 00:32:32,938
How do you know where I live?

350
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:35,691
Huh? Have you?

351
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:38,611
Well? Have you?

352
00:32:43,282 --> 00:32:45,326
How's your hand?

353
00:32:49,205 --> 00:32:51,248
Thank you.

354
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:54,043
I know.

355
00:32:57,129 --> 00:32:59,924
That's the scaredest
I've ever been in my whole life.

356
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:03,552
I just get squirrels in my stomach
thinking about it.

357
00:33:07,098 --> 00:33:10,810
I guess I don't have to worry
about you telling anybody, huh?

358
00:33:12,103 --> 00:33:14,980
It's kind of a real awkward thing
for a girl.

359
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:20,945
Well...

360
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,114
Don't take this the wrong way,

361
00:33:24,365 --> 00:33:26,408
but thank you.

362
00:33:33,415 --> 00:33:36,043
I follow you home.

363
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:39,839
You follow me home?

364
00:33:39,964 --> 00:33:41,966
I...

365
00:33:42,091 --> 00:33:44,009
What?

366
00:33:45,302 --> 00:33:47,388
I wasn't finished.

367
00:33:48,556 --> 00:33:50,599
Finish.

368
00:33:53,185 --> 00:33:56,063
I follow you home when you walk

369
00:33:56,188 --> 00:34:01,527
to... make sure you're... safe.

370
00:34:02,778 --> 00:34:05,281
I've never seen you.

371
00:34:06,657 --> 00:34:08,701
Well, I stay pretty far behind.

372
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:13,873
- I'm sorry.
- Well...

373
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:17,793
I mean, don't be sorry. I just...

374
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,712
I wasn't finished.

375
00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:23,549
Finish.

376
00:34:25,968 --> 00:34:29,555
I'm sorry that... I was late...

377
00:34:32,057 --> 00:34:34,226
that night.

378
00:34:36,061 --> 00:34:38,856
I don't think I ever heard you speak,
and when you do,

379
00:34:38,981 --> 00:34:42,610
you apologise to me
for saving me against...

380
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:45,446
God knows what could have happened.

381
00:34:45,571 --> 00:34:49,617
Why should I be surprised? My life is like
watching the Three Stooges in Spanish.

382
00:34:49,742 --> 00:34:52,953
- Either I'm being dumped or attacked.
<i>- (banging)</i>

383
00:34:53,078 --> 00:34:55,122
Don't hit the machine!

384
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:01,670
I'm sorry. I don't even know
what I'm saying any more.

385
00:35:01,796 --> 00:35:04,507
I'll talk to you about this later.

386
00:35:04,632 --> 00:35:06,675
And I brought your coat back.

00:35:45,172 --> 00:35:47,758
Been looking a little puffy these days.

You sure it was the flu

I'm all right.

What do you think about Adam?

I think he's very weird.

403
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:06,777
I wonder what he thinks about.

404
00:36:07,862 --> 00:36:13,033
I don't think Adam actually thinks. We're
talkin' about a man who hasn't spoken.

00:36:13,868 --> 00:36:18,164
- So?
- So? You don't find that a little weird?

00:36:19,832 --> 00:36:21,876
Look at him.

407
00:36:24,837 --> 00:36:28,424
He looks like a tumour sitting over there.
And his hair. Oh, God!

408
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:31,010
It just bothers me so much.

409
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:35,723
You know, Lottie says
that he has ape parts in him,

410
00:36:35,848 --> 00:36:38,100

Oh, my God. Lottie.

Too bad, though.

414
00:36:49,862 --> 00:36:51,906
He is kinda cute.

415
00:36:54,241 --> 00:36:57,745
I'd do him. If he just wasn't so dumb.

416
00:37:05,002 --> 00:37:07,671
So what are you doin' for Christmas?

417
00:37:08,547 --> 00:37:10,508
Uh...

418
00:37:10,633 --> 00:37:14,095
The usual. Grandparents coming over,

419
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,432
sitting in front of the TV,
looking at the stupid tree,

420
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:23,979
giving me ten dollars,
asking me where my boyfriend is.

Oh, hon.

422
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:32,238
You know, it's all right to feel shitty
this time of year. Everybody does.

It's, like, this is life, and when
you go through it long enough,

429
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:58,222
"What's wrong with Caroline?
She misses us or what? Or she hates us."

430
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,934
We'll see.

431
00:38:03,102 --> 00:38:07,231
We'll see, huh? We'll see. You know,
I knew you were gonna say that.

432
00:38:07,356 --> 00:38:10,818
Just forget the whole thing.
You know, just forget it.

433
00:38:12,278 --> 00:38:17,199
You got a problem. You really gotta learn
to follow through with things.

434
00:38:17,324 --> 00:38:20,161
I mean, you never finish
anything you start.

435
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:24,206
- I finish.
- Oh, yeah?

436
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:26,375
Did you finish beauty school?

437
00:38:27,585 --> 00:38:30,463
We got our practical exam in two weeks.

438
00:38:30,588 --> 00:38:34,717
Yeah, and what about the flower shop?
What happened to the opening?

439
00:38:34,842 --> 00:38:36,886
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

440
00:38:37,845 --> 00:38:41,474
You know what, Caroline?
I'm gonna give you your first lesson.

441

Come 3am, I see empty sugar jars,

- Hm?

00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:14,775
- Ever been to a game?
- No.

455
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,320
Maybe we could go to a game sometime.

456
00:40:20,823 --> 00:40:22,867
You took my bandage off.

457

It's OK.

00:42:23,779 --> 00:42:26,449
There's the Big Dipper.

469
00:42:26,574 --> 00:42:28,617
There's the North Star.

470
00:42:30,286 --> 00:42:33,581
- Come on, I wanna show you something.
- <i>(Caroline)</i> All right.

471
00:42:37,084 --> 00:42:39,128
What's this?

472
00:42:47,052 --> 00:42:50,014
It's OK. This is where I live.

473
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:53,434
Oh.

474
00:42:58,773 --> 00:43:00,816
- Ooh!
- This is my dog.

475
00:43:02,526 --> 00:43:04,570
Hi. Hi.

476
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,283
Good dog. What's her name?

477
00:43:09,408 --> 00:43:11,869
I don't know. He never told me.

478
00:43:14,622 --> 00:43:17,541
I don't mean to be rude to you
in your own place or anything,

479
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:20,336
but you are a little strange sometimes.

480
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:24,548
- Would you like some ice cream?
- Ice cream?

481
00:43:27,009 --> 00:43:29,053
No, I... No.

482
00:43:32,098 --> 00:43:34,141
You read all these books?

483
00:43:35,851 --> 00:43:37,895
I don't sleep very well.

484
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:44,318
Got a... cosy little apartment.

485
00:43:53,828 --> 00:43:55,663
You...

486
00:43:57,832 --> 00:44:03,003
This is from New Year's Eve. Did you take
this from behind the counter at work?

487
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:11,554
I better get going.

488
00:44:13,722 --> 00:44:15,766
Thanks for everything.

489
00:44:20,604 --> 00:44:22,022
Uh...

490
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:29,321
Well, tomorrow's Christmas Eve,
and I don't work the day after that, so...

491
00:44:30,823 --> 00:44:33,033
Merry Christmas.

492
00:45:13,866 --> 00:45:15,826

00:45:15,951 --> 00:45:17,995

I brought you some cookies. I made them.

521
00:47:37,927 --> 00:47:40,763
Did you have a nice Christmas yesterday?

522
00:47:44,058 --> 00:47:46,102
Can I come in?

523
00:47:56,779 --> 00:48:01,283
- Great weather. What do you think?
- Would you like some ice cream?

524
00:48:01,408 --> 00:48:03,661
Big on the ice cream, aren't you?

525
00:48:03,786 --> 00:48:05,830
No, thanks.

526
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:17,550
Well, I guess the cookies
are a little on the sugary side.

527
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:25,141
So, you were all alone for Christmas.

528
00:48:25,266 --> 00:48:30,062
I should have stopped over yesterday.
I should have invited you over.

529
00:48:30,187 --> 00:48:34,191
But... I guess you were already there.

530
00:48:36,569 --> 00:48:40,197
Thank you for the tree. It's so beautiful.

531
00:48:40,656 --> 00:48:43,451
It really made my day
that you remembered.

532
00:48:47,413 --> 00:48:50,082
Did I come at a bad time?
Do you want me to go?

533
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:53,502
- No.
- OK, then I'll stay.

534
00:48:56,672 --> 00:49:00,134
I'm not even gonna ask
how you got into our house.

535
00:49:10,686 --> 00:49:13,647
- Do you like music, Caroline?
- Mm-hm.

536
00:49:21,113 --> 00:49:24,325
I never heard you say my name before.
It sounded nice.

537
00:49:27,203 --> 00:49:30,790
Would you like to see my records,
Caroline? Caroline?

538
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:33,417
Sure.

539
00:49:48,182 --> 00:49:50,226
Wow.

540
00:49:53,354 --> 00:49:55,397
They look really old.

541
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,484
They're magic.

542
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:02,488
They're not magic!
What kind of magic do they do?

543
00:50:04,406 --> 00:50:08,244
In the orphanage
Mother Camilla used to play them for me.

544
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:12,915
I used to sit in the sunlight
near the window in her office,

545
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,084
and I'd fall asleep to them.

546
00:50:16,168 --> 00:50:18,629
She gave them to me when I left.

547
00:50:21,132 --> 00:50:27,513
Whenever my life doesn't agree with me,
I lie down and I play these records and...

548
00:50:27,638 --> 00:50:29,682
the rain stops falling.

549
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,895
Would you like to hear one?

550
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,355
Mm-hm.

<i>(# piano music)</i>

552
00:51:11,557 --> 00:51:16,604
You must have loved her a lot...
Mother Camilla.

553
00:51:20,858 --> 00:51:22,735
She...

554
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,821
She's the one
who told me about my heart.

555
00:51:26,864 --> 00:51:28,908
What about your heart?

556
00:51:31,118 --> 00:51:34,330
I was... I was a very sick baby.

557
00:51:35,581 --> 00:51:37,625
My heart was very weak.

558
00:51:40,044 --> 00:51:42,505
My mother, she died when I was born.

559
00:51:44,715 --> 00:51:47,885
She died in the jungle,
where she and my father were living.

560
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:50,221
In the jungle?

561
00:51:50,346 --> 00:51:52,807
My father was a great adventurer.

562
00:51:59,271 --> 00:52:04,318
One day the great king
of the silver baboons

563
00:52:04,443 --> 00:52:09,198
came down from his peak
high on the mountaintops of Kilimanjaro

564
00:52:09,323 --> 00:52:14,662
and caught my father stealing his treasure
from a deep, dark cave at the very bottom,

565
00:52:14,787 --> 00:52:18,916
where magic rubies trickled down
from the top of the mountain.

566
00:52:22,002 --> 00:52:25,089
After a terrible battle
with the baboon king,

567
00:52:26,424 --> 00:52:29,093
my father was wounded and left to die.

568
00:52:31,429 --> 00:52:35,433
When the great king later learned that
my father needed the enchanted rubies

569
00:52:35,558 --> 00:52:38,018
to heal his son with the dying heart,

570
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,691
he was so overwhelmed with guilt
and shame at what he had done

571
00:52:43,816 --> 00:52:49,655
that he took his own beating heart
right from his mighty baboon chest

572
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:52,533
and placed it in mine.

573
00:52:54,994 --> 00:52:57,496
Mother Camilla told you all this?

574
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:02,835
You believe her?

575
00:53:06,756 --> 00:53:08,799
And you tell this to people?

576
00:53:13,095 --> 00:53:16,766
Oh, no. It's a nice story.

577
00:53:22,646 --> 00:53:24,690
It's stopped raining.

578
00:53:39,705 --> 00:53:43,459
Magic records and a baboon heart.

579
00:53:45,169 --> 00:53:47,463
You almost got <i>me</i> believin' in it.

580
00:53:52,802 --> 00:53:54,845
How'd you like me to cut your hair?

581
00:54:18,077 --> 00:54:20,121
It's OK. No one's home.

582
00:54:25,292 --> 00:54:27,753
Mind if I ask who cuts this thing?

583
00:54:28,671 --> 00:54:31,549
- I do.
- I see.

584
00:54:32,716 --> 00:54:36,053
- Mind if I ask something else?
- Ouch.

585
00:54:36,178 --> 00:54:38,222
Sorry.

586
00:54:41,225 --> 00:54:46,522
Did you ever think of doing anything else
with your life besides bus boy?

587
00:54:46,647 --> 00:54:50,359
I mean, you must have had
an education at the orphanage.

588
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:55,197
I'm not very good with people.

589
00:54:55,322 --> 00:54:57,658
Don't let people stand in your way.

590
00:54:57,783 --> 00:55:00,661
They're only people, just like you and me.

591
00:55:01,912 --> 00:55:04,540
Well, maybe not like you.

592
00:55:04,665 --> 00:55:07,918
I don't know
if I've ever met anyone like you.

593
00:55:15,134 --> 00:55:18,679
The first I can remember,
I was four years old.

594
00:55:20,306 --> 00:55:22,308
And?

595
00:55:22,433 --> 00:55:28,981
I wasn't allowed any physical contact or...
even allowed to go out in public.

596
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,110
Why?

597
00:55:33,235 --> 00:55:35,738
My health was still poor.

598
00:55:35,863 --> 00:55:38,908
Cos of the risk of infection.

599
00:55:42,244 --> 00:55:46,874
People were so used to staying away
from me that they always stayed away.

600
00:55:49,752 --> 00:55:51,796
I never got close to people.

601
00:55:54,632 --> 00:55:58,135
Jeez. That's gotta be hard on a kid.

602
00:55:59,261 --> 00:56:03,641
Not being held
or being allowed to hold anyone.

603
00:56:10,022 --> 00:56:12,066
What does your father do?

604
00:56:15,069 --> 00:56:16,987
Uh...

605
00:56:17,113 --> 00:56:19,782
Actually, my stepdad.

606
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:25,162
Step to the rear.

607
00:56:25,788 --> 00:56:27,957
He's a bus driver.

608
00:56:28,082 --> 00:56:31,210
MTC between Minneapolis and St Paul.

609
00:56:31,377 --> 00:56:35,214
He's a real good guy.
You should meet him sometime.

610
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:39,802
He was on <i>Candid Camera.</i> They locked
him in a closet. He was great about it.

611
00:56:41,512 --> 00:56:46,225
My real dad is like
oil and vinegar with everybody.

612
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:48,394
He just don't mix.

613
00:56:51,188 --> 00:56:53,232
Cindy says screw him.

614
00:56:55,526 --> 00:57:00,197
Well, first guy to walk out of my life,
certainly not the last.

615
00:57:01,991 --> 00:57:03,284
Weird, huh?

616

He's got some kind of heart problem.

It's been left untreated for far too long.

787
01:14:15,733 --> 01:14:20,321
He should remain stable
until a proper donor is available.

788
01:14:20,446 --> 01:14:22,406
And how long can that take?

789
01:14:22,531 --> 01:14:24,575
That we don't know.

790
01:14:26,744 --> 01:14:30,873
He's sedated now,
but he became very upset before,

791
01:14:30,998 --> 01:14:34,585
when we were talking about going in
to relieve the pressure on his heart.

792
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:38,923
It took two orderlies, two nurses
and myself just to hold him down.

793
01:14:39,048 --> 01:14:41,759
We were surprised
that didn't kill him right there,

794
01:14:41,884 --> 01:14:44,428
what with all the trauma he's experienced.

795
01:14:44,553 --> 01:14:47,723
However, that's also
a very good sign of hope,

796
01:14:47,848 --> 01:14:50,226
that he's more than strong enough

797
01:14:50,351 --> 01:14:54,855
and he can go on living for quite some
time with treatment for what he's got.

798
01:14:56,690 --> 01:14:59,902
Good evening.
Are you with the lady in there?

799
01:15:00,027 --> 01:15:02,404
- Yes. Yes, she's my best friend.
- OK.

800
01:15:04,323 --> 01:15:07,326
- Number five and number seven.
- You positive?

801
01:15:08,202 --> 01:15:10,496
- Number five and number seven.
- Thank you.

802
01:15:10,621 --> 01:15:14,542
Just step over here and we'll get
the paperwork out of the way.

803
01:16:13,267 --> 01:16:15,478
You're not taking off too much, are you?

804
01:16:15,603 --> 01:16:17,396
No.

805
01:16:17,521 --> 01:16:21,317
I only want a trim.
Did you hear me, young lady?

806
01:16:21,442 --> 01:16:23,486
Yeah, I heard you. You told me.

807
01:16:29,158 --> 01:16:33,370
I can't believe I gotta do this today.
I can't take this freakin' lady.

808
01:16:33,496 --> 01:16:36,082
I know. Just try to calm down.

809
01:16:36,207 --> 01:16:39,794
You can't work a miracle,
so just do what you can. Hang tough.

810
01:16:39,919 --> 01:16:45,591
I know you're being tested today. I hope
you're not trying to impress anybody.

811
01:16:45,716 --> 01:16:51,222
All I want is a trim.
It's too cold out yet for short hair.

812
01:16:51,972 --> 01:16:54,100
Mm-hm. Just keep your head still.

813
01:16:55,226 --> 01:16:58,270
Should we maybe involve
your instructor in this,

814
01:16:58,395 --> 01:17:04,193
and she could make sure you don't
make a disaster area out of my hair, hm?

815
01:17:06,195 --> 01:17:08,239
Why'd you stop?

816
01:17:12,243 --> 01:17:16,414
You're not butchering it, are you? I
wouldn't like to have you butcher my hair.

817
01:17:16,539 --> 01:17:19,166
I'm not butchering your hair.
It's a free haircut.

818
01:17:19,291 --> 01:17:23,045
So stop your bitchin'
before I cut it all off, you fat cow!

819
01:17:24,088 --> 01:17:26,132
Thanks!

820
01:17:30,136 --> 01:17:32,179
<i>(phone rings)</i>

821
01:17:41,063 --> 01:17:44,316
- <i>(Cindy)</i> What?
- Can you drive me over to the hospital?

822
01:17:44,442 --> 01:17:48,362
I don't have a car, nobody's home,
and I really wanna see Adam.

823
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:51,323
When do they open?

824
01:17:51,991 --> 01:17:54,243
I don't know.

825
01:17:58,539 --> 01:17:59,915
Never mind. He's here.

826
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:02,084
Adam!

827
01:18:05,546 --> 01:18:07,757
What are you doin' here?

828
01:18:07,882 --> 01:18:10,968
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to upset you, Caroline.

829
01:18:11,844 --> 01:18:14,263
I was so scared.

830
01:18:14,388 --> 01:18:17,725
Are you OK? Are you OK?
You wanna come inside?

831
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:22,229
You want me to get you something to eat?
You want some breakfast?

832
01:18:22,354 --> 01:18:25,149
The stitches, your stitches.

833
01:18:25,274 --> 01:18:27,318
I bet you're sore.

834
01:18:29,945 --> 01:18:32,615
I'm supposed to be giving you flowers.

835
01:18:33,824 --> 01:18:35,868
They're beautiful.

836
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:41,123
What'd the doctor say?

837
01:18:41,957 --> 01:18:45,211
I'm not allowed to stick
knives in my stomach.

838
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,173
Very funny. You could have been killed.

839
01:18:49,298 --> 01:18:51,759
They caught the guys who did it to you.

840
01:18:52,802 --> 01:18:55,387
Do the police know what they did to you?

841
01:18:55,513 --> 01:18:57,556
Yeah. I told them.

842
01:18:58,557 --> 01:19:01,227
We'll probably both have to go to court.

843
01:19:04,105 --> 01:19:07,358
Did you have your beauty exam today?

844
01:19:09,985 --> 01:19:12,238
Yeah, but...

845
01:19:12,363 --> 01:19:14,406
it just...

846
01:19:14,532 --> 01:19:19,078
Forget it. It was just a stupid licence.
I was no good at it anyway.

847
01:19:19,203 --> 01:19:21,247
Don't say that.

848
01:19:24,708 --> 01:19:29,463
So... the doctor told you
you're gonna have to have a transplant?

849
01:19:35,594 --> 01:19:38,431
- Adam.
- No. They're wrong.

850
01:19:38,556 --> 01:19:40,766
Adam, the heart you have is diseased.

851
01:19:40,891 --> 01:19:42,935
No one is taking away my heart.

852
01:19:43,936 --> 01:19:46,188
You were just a kid. It was just a story.

853
01:19:46,313 --> 01:19:50,568
You're gonna die someday
if you don't do something about it.

854
01:19:50,693 --> 01:19:52,653
But this is my heart.

855
01:19:54,488 --> 01:19:57,992
I don't want you to die. I love you.

856
01:20:02,037 --> 01:20:04,081
I was...

857
01:20:04,999 --> 01:20:07,877
I was wondering if you think about me.

858
01:20:08,669 --> 01:20:10,880
Of course I think about you.

859
01:20:12,631 --> 01:20:14,717
I wasn't finished.

860
01:20:16,302 --> 01:20:17,803
Finish.

861
01:20:19,847 --> 01:20:22,725
I was wondering if you think about me...

862
01:20:25,269 --> 01:20:27,646
half as much as I think about you.

863
01:20:48,626 --> 01:20:52,421
I, uh... have to tell you something.

864
01:20:57,218 --> 01:20:59,261
It might make you angry.

865
01:21:00,262 --> 01:21:02,306
Look at me.

866
01:21:06,519 --> 01:21:08,979
I watch you sleep sometimes.

867
01:21:10,981 --> 01:21:14,777
The tree - it wasn't the first time
I was in your room.

868
01:21:17,446 --> 01:21:19,490
Or the last.

869
01:21:21,867 --> 01:21:24,245
You come into my room?

870
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:29,458
The basement under the porch.

871
01:21:32,294 --> 01:21:34,338
To watch me sleep?

872
01:21:35,965 --> 01:21:37,341
Why?

873
01:21:39,927 --> 01:21:41,971
You have peace.

874
01:21:43,305 --> 01:21:45,349
I don't.

875
01:21:46,892 --> 01:21:49,562
My sleep, it's always the same dream.

876
01:21:50,771 --> 01:21:53,357
The jungle.

877
01:21:53,482 --> 01:21:58,154
Dreary, twisted limbs. Strangling vines.

878
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:02,283
And rain.

879
01:22:03,033 --> 01:22:05,077
Always the rain.

880
01:22:08,998 --> 01:22:11,876
I feel suffocated.

881
01:22:14,211 --> 01:22:16,255
Despair.

882
01:22:16,964 --> 01:22:19,425
Despair of just trying to survive.

883
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:23,304
Despair and no peace.

884
01:22:25,806 --> 01:22:29,351
I'm... afraid if they take away my heart,

885
01:22:31,687 --> 01:22:34,148
I won't be able to love you the same.

886
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,444
You are my peace.

887
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:43,574
Oh, my God.

888
01:22:44,366 --> 01:22:50,122
You love with your mind and your soul,
not actually with your heart.

889
01:22:50,247 --> 01:22:52,083
It's just a saying.

890
01:22:57,254 --> 01:23:02,259
Why does it hurt so much here when...
you're not with me?

Come here. You're so beautiful.

930
01:25:44,255 --> 01:25:46,298
You get this.

931
01:25:47,425 --> 01:25:49,468
You get this.

932
01:25:58,477 --> 01:26:00,521
And you get this.

933
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,364
Go get your coat.

934
01:26:11,407 --> 01:26:14,410
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

935
01:26:18,914 --> 01:26:22,126
- What's that?
- It's a present for you.

936
01:26:23,586 --> 01:26:26,547
- For me?
- Don't open it.

937
01:26:26,672 --> 01:26:29,759
It's a surprise.
We can open it later together.

938
01:26:30,384 --> 01:26:33,679
You got... you got me
a present on your birthday?

939
01:26:43,105 --> 01:26:45,983
- I have fallen...
- Did you hurt yourself?

940
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:49,653
I wasn't finished.

941
01:26:50,571 --> 01:26:53,824
I have fallen so in love with you.

942
01:26:55,576 --> 01:26:58,037
So much more than I told you I would.

943
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:06,504
All right.

944
01:27:13,844 --> 01:27:15,888
OK.

945
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:25,815
Come on.

946
01:28:04,728 --> 01:28:07,273
Clear it out! Clear it out!

947
01:28:07,398 --> 01:28:09,442
Clear it out!

948
01:28:13,154 --> 01:28:14,321
- Yeah!
- Oh!

949
01:29:32,608 --> 01:29:36,445
North Stars! North Stars! Yeah!

950
01:29:40,282 --> 01:29:45,996
I can't believe you caught a puck.
That's, like... It's, like, never happened.

951
01:29:46,122 --> 01:29:48,165
Amazing.

952
01:29:50,459 --> 01:29:52,503
You're amazing.

953
01:29:55,881 --> 01:29:58,926
Thank you for taking me, Caroline.

954
01:29:59,051 --> 01:30:01,178
I didn't know if you'd like it.

955
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:03,764
You know what I like.

956
01:30:06,684 --> 01:30:08,769
I'm glad you like it as much as me.

957
01:30:10,146 --> 01:30:12,189
- I love hockey.
<i>- (laughs)</i>

958
01:30:14,066 --> 01:30:16,986
You didn't even know
what a power play was.

959
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:22,450
I know, but the next time we go
you can tell me,

960
01:30:22,575 --> 01:30:25,661
and I'll catch another one of these for you.

961
01:30:30,666 --> 01:30:33,127
It was a good game, huh?

962
01:30:34,086 --> 01:30:37,047
Yeah. A good game.

963
01:31:30,768 --> 01:31:32,103
Hey.

964
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:35,815
Baby. Wake up.

965
01:31:36,732 --> 01:31:38,567
We're home.

966
01:31:38,692 --> 01:31:40,528
Hey.

967
01:31:40,653 --> 01:31:43,280
Wake up. Wake up.

968
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:48,369
Sweetie. We're home.

969
01:31:51,497 --> 01:31:53,541
Hey!

970
01:31:56,043 --> 01:31:58,087
Hey.

971
01:32:13,018 --> 01:32:15,062
<i>(dog barks)</i>

972
01:32:31,829 --> 01:32:33,873
<i>(sobs)</i>

973
01:32:55,770 --> 01:33:00,566
<i>(priest)</i> If I give away all my possessions,
if I hand over my body so I may boast,

974
01:33:00,691 --> 01:33:03,319
but do not have love, I gain nothing.

975
01:33:03,444 --> 01:33:05,738
Love is patient, love is kind.

976
01:33:05,863 --> 01:33:09,450
Love is not envious or boastful
or arrogant or rude.

977
01:33:09,575 --> 01:33:11,869
It does not insist on its own way.

978
01:33:11,994 --> 01:33:14,038
It is not irritable or resentful.

979
01:33:14,163 --> 01:33:18,375
It does not rejoice in wrongdoing,
but rejoices in the truth.

980
01:33:18,501 --> 01:33:21,420
It bears all things, believes all things,

981
01:33:21,545 --> 01:33:24,131
hopes all things, endures all things.

982
01:33:24,256 --> 01:33:26,300
Love never ends.

983
01:33:26,425 --> 01:33:29,095
But as for prophecies,
they will come to an end.

984
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:32,807
As for tongues, they will cease.
As for knowledge, it will come to an end.

985
01:33:32,932 --> 01:33:36,727
For we only know in part,
and we prophecy only in part.

986
01:33:36,852 --> 01:33:40,773
But when the complete comes,
the partial will come to an end.

987
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:55,579
I love you.

988
01:33:57,873 --> 01:34:00,292
You're family.

989
01:34:00,418 --> 01:34:02,461
Good.

990
01:34:03,587 --> 01:34:05,631
You're lucky. I love you too.

991
01:34:09,135 --> 01:34:11,178
Luck has nothing to do with it.

992
01:34:14,390 --> 01:34:16,434
He was like an angel, you know?

993
01:34:18,269 --> 01:34:20,729
I never knew life could be like that.

994
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:27,862
He was the one thing I followed through
with, the one thing I didn't give up on.

995
01:34:29,697 --> 01:34:31,741
And I was good at loving him.

996
