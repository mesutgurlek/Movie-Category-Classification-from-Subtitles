Aah!

174
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:44,770
Watch out!

175
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,531
Well, I guess you
don't want the baby.

176
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,629
Sir, your car will be
ready in a minute.

177
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,130
You're lucky

178
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:14,132
the engine's
in the back.

179
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,634
[Samuel]
Yeah. Right.

180
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,640
Hi.

181
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,642
Ready in a minute.

182
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,143
Good.

183
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,145
So, um...

184
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:30,649
we are absolutely certain
about this, right?

185
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,151
Well, my period's
10 days late.

186
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,319
Right.

187
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:37,823
And there's no way
you could have had it

188
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,283
and just not noticed?

189
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:43,161
Sorry. Ridiculous.
That was stupid. Stupid.

190
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,664
Could you be a little
more positive about this,

191
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,666
more supportive?

192
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,418
I'm trying to
be positive.

193
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,338
Killing us in a head-on
collision is not positive.

194
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:55,174
It must have been shock.

195
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:57,759
Out of the blue,
you sayyou're pregnant.

196
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:00,304
It was just
a little bit unexpected

197
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,806
was probably the reason
for the crash.

198
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,309
I thought you were
using birth control.

199
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,310
I was.

200
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,520
Your car's ready now,
sir.

201
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:09,813
Great.

202
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:15,819
Oh...

203
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,821
you don't believe me!

204
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,156
No?

205
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:22,201
You think I got pregnant
behind your back.

206
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,620
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

207
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,163
Do you think
I planned this?

208
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:29,166
I'm as flipped out
as you are.

209
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,667
I suppose
I just thought

210
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,169
that birth control

211
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:35,506
had a little teeny element
of control about it.

212
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,509
Thought it was supposed
to be foolproof .

213
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,677
Nothing is foolproof .
It's only 97% effective.

214
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,221
It says so on the box.

215
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,181
Yeah. Right.
97% effective.

216
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:46,683
So 3% completely
bloody ineffective.

217
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,895
They should put that
on the box.

218
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,396
Here you are.

No idea.

about you guys.

What happened to Christine?

A long story.

So this is where
you two are going to stay.

think of  her?

What,
you mean the blonde?

Very attractive.

She's 25 years old.

Her skin
is like ribbon candy.

like sponge cake.

Her calves
are like calzone.

highly edible.

247

Highly edible.

about sex.

She said she wanted--

She, uh...
Christine wanted a baby.

267
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,799
She was hungry
for seed,

268
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,302
so I closed
the iron door,

269
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:47,179
denied her
my essence.

270

You know,
I'm not ready

271
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,142
to be biologically
extraneous.

272
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:54,186
She would have
devoured me

and gobbled me up

Not for me.

What do you mean,

with her mate,

wasn't pregnant

or anything
like that?

No. What do you mean?
Like on the sly?

It's nonsense.

No, what I'm saying is

378
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:29,294
I think it's such baloney
and such a cliche

379
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:32,297
that the artist
has to be messed up

380
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,883
and have a life
of deprivation,

You could be
the toughest guy,

but when your child
looks into your eyes

and that child knows
you're their dad...

Is being excited a reason

Right.

I can't be a father.

I can't.
I ca...I...I...

504
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:46,612
Why would I want to
have a child?

505
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:51,617
Just so he can call me a bastard
in 10 years' time?

506
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,619
We'd have to move out.

507
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:57,164
We don't have space
for a child.

we're wonderful together.

to spoil it.

That's how it should be.

511

This baby is not
a good idea.

No. Wait.

522
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:28,779
Wait. This pregnancy
was an accident.

523
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,281
It took us
completely by surprise.

524
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:32,324
Right.

We've been doing
really great together,

526
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:37,287
and a baby
would change everything.

527
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:38,789
I suppose it could.

528
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:41,792
Our apartment's
not ready for a baby.

529

No.

530
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:44,294
We'd have to
redecorate.

531

Yep.

532
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:47,798
I'd have to
quit myjob.

533

Nobody wants
a pregnant dance teacher.

534

We're not ready
for a child.

535
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:56,306
There's not one good reason
to keep this baby.

536
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:02,271
But I still want to.

537
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:06,859
Right.

538
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,360
Maybe it's crazy,

539
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:11,363
but I feel it
living inside me.

540

feel on that one?

What?

664
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:01,713
Oh, my God.

665
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:04,216
On March 17th,
I was away

666
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:08,345
at a child psychiatry conference
in Boston, remember?

667
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:09,972
What are you
saying?

668
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:12,015
I'll leave you two alone.

669
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:13,058
That's fine.
I'm going.

670
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,561
No! Wait!
Come back! Sit down!

671
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:17,062
Samuel, sit down!

672
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:18,564
Checkyour computer
again!

673
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:21,567
It is--the computer
is very accurate.

674
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,484
Check the goddamn
computer.

675
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:23,527
Check it!

676
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:26,071
Don't yell at me!
Please don't do this.

677
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:27,823
I spent a year
in Afghanistan.

678
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:30,826
I have sometimes
very low tolerance for pressure.

679
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:31,869
Come on!

680
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:34,872
O.K. What is wrong
with the thing?

681
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:37,374
Oh, fuck me!
It's not working.

682
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:38,876
[Cursing In Russian]

683
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:41,378
Hold on. O.K.
What is wrong?

684
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:43,255
Oh, O.K. O.K.
Excuse me.

685
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:45,716
This is the problem.

686
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,594
It is feces
flying into the fan.

687
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:51,096
There are function keys
for humans and simians,

688
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:52,639
and you're not a simian.

689
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:54,099
No, I'm not.

690
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:56,560
I had you as a baboon.

691
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:58,604
Sorry. I didn't...

692
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:02,274
There you go.
Were you here March 23rd?

693
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:03,317
Yeah.

694
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:04,693
With her?

695
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:05,944
- Yes.
- Yes.

696
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:08,489
O.K., um,
everything is fine now.

697
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,450
We're all back on-line,
and your baby...

698
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:14,786
your baby will be born
on December 15th.

699
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:18,040
O.K. Now it is time
for the physical examination.

700
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:21,543
Let's take a look
at your Volvo, O.K.?

701
00:33:21,627 --> 00:33:25,339
Come with me into here.
I'll warm my hands for you.

702
00:33:27,132 --> 00:33:28,717
Please come in.

703
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:32,262
All right, madam.

704
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:35,641
if you would get undressed,
we'll begin, O.K.?

705
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:38,894
And you may stay,
sir, if you like.

706
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:40,395
That's fine.
I'll wait--

707
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:41,897
Don't you dare.

708
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,649
I'd like to
stay.

709
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:46,693
Very good.
Let me get ready for you.

710
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,456
O.K.

711
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,500
We've worked out
all the insects.

712
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:04,169
Giddy up.

713
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:09,049
[Whispers]
Run.

714
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:13,512
That lunatic
is not delivering me.

715
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:15,556
That's fine.
He's just a replacement.

716
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:17,432
Dr. Green will be there.

717
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:20,185
Let me help you, honey.
Just be gentle!

718
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:22,187
Honey, listen,
I was thinking,

719
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:23,689
about the baby--

720
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,692
Let's just keep it
to ourselves, huh?

721
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,694
Um, um,
yeah, all right.

722
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,195
Talking about it

723
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:32,531
before the third month
is bad luck.

724
00:34:32,614 --> 00:34:34,575
Marty, look who's here!

725
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:36,618
[Marty]
Hey, look who's here!

726
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:39,079
Hey, guys,
what the hell?

727
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:41,790
Good to see you!
How you doing?

728
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:42,791
Hi.

729
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,293
When
are you due?

730
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:45,794
Oh, I'm not
pregnant.

731
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:47,796
You're not pregnant?
Yeah, right.

732
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,797
Huh?

733
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:50,549
What are you
doing

734
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:52,467
on the maternity
floor?

735
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:54,970
Are we on
the maternity floor?

736
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:56,805
Good grief.
We're completely lost.

737
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,182
Poor old Beck.

738
00:34:58,265 --> 00:34:59,641
She had
some bad Chinese.

739
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:02,394
We're here to see
the gastrointestinal specialist.

740
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:03,645
What's his name?

741
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:05,189
His name?

742
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:06,523
Yeah.

743
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:08,525
I can probably
tell you

744
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,027
what floor he's on.

745
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:12,362
She volunteers here. I've sold
cars to almost every doctor.

746
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:13,864
Beck, what's his name?

747
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:15,866
It's Dr. something,
isn't it?

748
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,326
It's Doctor...

749
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:18,827
Ridiculous.

750
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:20,329
Excuse me.

751
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:21,830
Oh, gosh.
Thanks.

752
00:35:21,914 --> 00:35:24,333
I didn't realize
I'd left it.

753
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:25,834
thank you
very much.

You have
a small pussy.

00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:29,004
What?

756
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:32,090
I found the little hairs
on the bag.

757
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:33,091
What?

758
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:34,635
You know, the...meow...

759
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:36,470
Oh, cat!

760
00:35:36,512 --> 00:35:38,931
Yes, we have a cat.

761
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:41,975
Well, you must
get rid of  it.

762
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:42,976
What?

763
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,436
Cats spread the disease.

764
00:35:44,478 --> 00:35:46,939
Oh, yeah. Where
the small worms...

765
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,440
Yes.
Small worms.

766
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:50,025
In the poop.

thank you both
very much,

00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,157
but Skippy
is old and clean

771
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,159
and won't cause
any problem.

772
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:01,620
O.K. Well,
it is your choice--

773
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:04,665
the cat or the baby.

that news.

Oh, congratulations,
guys.

I'm so excited!

Congratulations,
you guys.

779
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:16,552
Congratulations.

780
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:19,054
Wow. That's great.
Oh, your first.

781
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:20,055
Thanks.

782
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:21,014
Sorry about--

783
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:22,516
That's all right.

784
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,518
I've been
lied to before.

785
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:26,019
You're good at it.

786
00:36:26,103 --> 00:36:28,897
We could use you
at the car lot.

787
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:30,440
[Gail]
It's so exciting!

788
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:32,568
[Marty]
We're happy for you.

789
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:34,069
How are you feeling?

790
00:36:34,153 --> 00:36:36,071
I'm O.K.
A little tired.

791
00:36:36,155 --> 00:36:37,573
Everybody
gets tired,

792
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:40,075
but the whole
thing is just

793
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,577
a life-changing
event.

794
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,579
I'll give
you my number.

795
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:45,581
We can go
baby shopping.

796
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:48,083
You've got to
get that book,

797
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:50,586
What To Expect
When You're Expecting.

798
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:54,047
And we've got videos of
all her births.

799
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:56,508
You've got to
film your first.

800
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,011
That's the best.
It's the bloodiest--

801
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:01,013
blood everywhere,
things shooting out,

802
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:04,016
people screaming, stuff getting
torn and sewed together.

803
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:07,269
It's like a good
World War I I movie.

804
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,021
Will you keep
the car?

805
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:10,522
Yeah. It's fine now.

806
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:12,774
Cost a bit of  money.

807
00:37:12,858 --> 00:37:15,360
But it only seats
two people.

808
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:16,904
It always did.

809
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:19,364
But you're going to
have a baby.

810
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:22,868
You could never fit
a car seat in there.

811
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,370
Listen, stop down
by the lot.

812
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:27,915
I'll make you
a good deal.

813
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:29,500
All right?

814
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,210
Great.

815
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:33,587
Honey, we got to go.
Bad Chinese...

816
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:35,047
Buddy!

817
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:37,049
Come on, baby.
Let's roll.

818
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,550
See you guys.

819
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:39,927
O.K.

820
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,429
I hate him.
I loathe him.

821
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:44,723
He tried to
sell me a new car.

822
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:47,726
Can you believe that?
Tacky or what?

823
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:49,228
Yeah,
but he's right.

824
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:51,730
We're going to need
something bigger.

825
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:54,566
But you know how much
I love my car.

826
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:56,443
I've worked
hard for it.

827
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:57,945
What do you
suggest?

828
00:37:58,028 --> 00:38:01,448
Tie the baby
to the hood like a deer?

829
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:04,743
Well, no, but maybe
you could get a car.

830
00:38:04,827 --> 00:38:06,745
On my salary?
Come on.

831
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:08,747
Well, put it this way.

832
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:11,667
I'm not getting rid
of the car.

833
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,418
What about the cat?

834
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:15,003
Huh?

835
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:18,006
What, you believe
Dr. Zhivago in there?

836
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,800
The monkey doctor?

837
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:22,261
He's right.
I've read about it.

838
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:25,138
Cats can be dangerous
for a baby.

839
00:38:25,222 --> 00:38:28,141
They can suffocate
the baby, claw the baby.

840
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:31,144
Skippy is 16.
He can barely move.

841
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:32,646
He's half-blind.

842
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:34,898
He's too weak
to suffocate anyone.

843
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:37,401
What about hygiene
in the kitchen?

844
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:40,737
You get cat hair
and cat saliva.

845
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:43,532
You said that this baby
wouldn't change our lives.

846
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:47,703
Now I have to sell my car
and get rid of  my cat.

847
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,705
This is the second month,

848
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:52,207
and our lives
are practically unrecognizable!

849
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:12,436
I really appreciate
your asking us along.

850
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:15,439
I'm hoping this
will get Samuel excited

851
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:16,940
about having a baby.

852
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:18,442
Oh, yeah. Sure.

853
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:19,943
Yeah, 'cause, um,

854
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:21,445
ifthings
don't change,

855
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:23,947
I'm thinking
about leaving him.

856
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:25,949
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Sure you are.

857
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:28,952
I thought about leaving
Marty all the time,

858
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:31,455
but this
is his first time.

859
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:34,458
You've got to
give him a chance.

860
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:35,959
He's completely
uninvolved.

861
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:38,962
This whole baby thing
really scares him.

862
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:41,465
He's probably having
trouble facing it.

863
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:43,467
if you have a baby,

864
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,470
that means
he's got to grow up.

865
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:49,473
The baby's the fun part.
That's fun.

866
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:52,684
You know.
Look at all this stuff.

867
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:54,186
Ah, yeah! Whoo!

868
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:56,188
He's going to
love this.

869
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:59,483
You know you're
having a boy, right?

870
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:01,151
Yeah.

871
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:06,156
Gail took one of those
amnio tests, I suppose.

872
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,157
No.

873
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:08,659
How do you know?

874
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:11,161
I can tell
it's a boy

875
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:14,665
by the way she's
carrying it all in front.

876
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:17,668
They don't of ten
carry them at the back.

877
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:19,169
If it's a boy,

878
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:21,672
they carry them low
like this.

879
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:24,675
If it's a girl,
it's up like this.

880
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:26,677
Plus, there are
special ways

881
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,680
to ensure that it
will be a boy.

882
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:32,182
What do you mean,
special ways?

883
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,184
Well,
when we made love...

884
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:35,686
Yeah?

885
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:37,521
we used
special positions.

886
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:39,022
Oh, please.

887
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:42,025
That's an old wives' tale,
that stuff.

888
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:43,360
You'll see.

889
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:47,614
Sometimes I'm not sure
I want this baby.

890
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:50,117
Oh, Missy,
of course you do.

891
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:52,119
It's just
such a privilege.

892
00:40:52,161 --> 00:40:53,620
There's hundreds
of women

893
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:56,540
who spend thousands
of dollars every day

894
00:40:56,623 --> 00:40:58,959
trying to
get pregnant.

895
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:01,336
It's like our prof ound
biological right.

896
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:03,589
It's something men
can never experience.

897
00:41:03,672 --> 00:41:06,508
It has to be
at the right time for you,

898
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,843
but really,
it's a miracle.

899
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:10,345
And then
when the baby comes,

900
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:14,516
there's moments
of sheer happiness.

901
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,644
Even if you're alone?

902
00:41:20,022 --> 00:41:22,983
I know it's fashionable,
PC, all that,

903
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,986
to be a strong,
independent single mother,

904
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:28,489
and, uh,
I'm prepared for that.

905
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:30,532
I can do that,

906
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:33,535
but, um, I would
love this baby

907
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:37,039
to have a mother
and a father.

908
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,042
I would love to
have a family,

909
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:43,212
and I would love to
marry Samuel.

910
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:45,756
Um...

911
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,759
all he has to do is ask.

912
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:53,055
Oh, Missy.

913
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:02,481
Okey-dokey.
Huh huh huh.

914
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:05,484
O.K. Tell your mommy
if she loves you,

915
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:08,487
she'll buyyou
the whole Arnie collection!

916
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,489
thank you,
Arnie.

917
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:11,990
Who loves you,
girls?

918
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:13,951
- Arnie.
- Arnie.

919
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:15,494
Hey, fellas.

920
00:42:15,577 --> 00:42:16,995
How about taking home

921
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:19,998
a new Arnie doll
for the kiddies?

922
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:21,500
No, thank you,
buddy.

923
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,001
Mister,
you'd look great

924
00:42:23,085 --> 00:42:26,004
in my "Arnie Loves You"
t-shirt.

925
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:29,007
They come in
extra-extra-extra large.

926
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:30,509
No, thank you.

927
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:33,512
How about a new
"Arnie Loves You" video?

928
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:36,390
§ Love is for
you and me §

929
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:38,016
No, thanks. O.K.?

930
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,686
§ We are one
big family §§

931
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:43,021
I'm not going to
buy your damn video!

932
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:45,357
But the kids
will love it.

933
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,276
My kids think
your show sucks.

934
00:42:50,112 --> 00:42:51,446
Oh.

935
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,448
But thanks,
anyway.

936
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:56,451
Hey, no hard feelings,
O.K.?

937
00:42:56,535 --> 00:42:58,453
All right. Sorry.

938
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:00,455
That's O.K.
Huh huh huh.

939
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:01,957
So long.

940
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:03,959
[Man's Voice]
Eh, you cheap shit.

941
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:05,460
What did you say?

942
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:06,962
[Arnie Voice]
Huh?

943
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:09,965
Oh, gee. I didn't say
nothing, mister.

944
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:12,009
He didn't say
anything, Marty.

945
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:14,094
Bye-bye.
Arnie loves you.

946
00:43:14,178 --> 00:43:16,221
[Man's Voice]
You penis-head.

947
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:17,723
I heard that!

948
00:43:17,806 --> 00:43:19,099
[Arnie Voice]
Heard what?

949
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:21,768
I heard what you said!

950
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:23,687
He's pathetic.
Come on.

951
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:27,274
There's children around here,
for God's sake!

952
00:43:27,357 --> 00:43:28,484
So long...

953
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:30,444
[Man's Voice]
you fat-ass pussy!

954
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:31,445
That's it!

955
00:43:31,528 --> 00:43:32,613
No.

956
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:33,614
Yes!

957
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:34,656
[Arnie Voice]
Uh-oh.

958
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,492
[Samuel]
No. No. Arnie.

959
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,076
Come on,
you wiener.

960
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:41,371
Come on,
you bitch.

961
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:43,165
Here's one
for the queen.

962
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:45,792
Oh!

963
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:46,960
I'll get him, Sammy.

964
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:48,295
Hey, cut it out.

965
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:50,506
Oh, you hit
like a girl,

966
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:51,840
you flatulent
butt-head.

967
00:43:51,924 --> 00:43:54,343
I'll take both
you wieners on.

968

You and that
pussy boyfriend!

Right, you bastard!

970

Who's the fat pussy
now, buddy?

971
00:44:01,141 --> 00:44:04,561
Tell your sister
to let go of  my tail,

you weak-wristed
Nancy boy!

Get off me,
you fat bastard!

974
00:44:10,108 --> 00:44:13,987
I'll shove an "Arnie Loves You"
lunch box up your ass!

Oh, you--
Hi, honey.

such a jerk!

We're in trouble.

980

[Arnie Voice]
Run to Mommy.

981
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:26,625
I'll wipe the floor
with you.

00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:28,502
Oh...

983

Wow! That's, uh...

that's quite a breakfast
you've got there.

Mm-hmm!

01:01:30,399 --> 01:01:32,359
No, no, no.
Don't scoff.

01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:33,819
Listen--
Forget about Rebecca.

1317
01:01:33,902 --> 01:01:35,320
How could you

1318
01:01:35,404 --> 01:01:36,864
say that to me?

1319
01:01:36,947 --> 01:01:38,365
You reminded me

1320
01:01:38,407 --> 01:01:39,867
she's the most important

1321
01:01:39,908 --> 01:01:41,660
thing in my life

1322
01:01:41,743 --> 01:01:43,328
just weeks ago.

1323
01:01:43,412 --> 01:01:45,330
I never said that.

1324
01:01:45,414 --> 01:01:47,374
I never--
I never said that.

1325
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:48,876
You said it

1326
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:50,377
at the tennis court.

1327
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,172
Oh, yeah.

1328
01:01:53,255 --> 01:01:54,840
So what if I did?

1329
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:56,884
That was then,
but it's over,

new clothes.

1334
01:02:04,183 --> 01:02:05,851
we'll learn
a new sport,

1335
01:02:05,934 --> 01:02:07,394
I'll throw a party,

you're incredibly

You're taking
care of  her?

1434
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:47,985
Gail's taking
her shopping,

1435
01:07:48,068 --> 01:07:49,319
and they're
exercising.

1436
01:07:49,361 --> 01:07:51,822
Then I make them
dinner every night.

1437
01:07:51,905 --> 01:07:53,323
Right.
And she's O.K.?

1438
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:55,826
Yeah. The first month,
she cried a lot,

1439
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:58,328
but she hasn't
mentioned you in two weeks.

1440
01:07:58,412 --> 01:08:00,330
I think she's
getting over you.

1441
01:08:01,748 --> 01:08:03,834
This is
the car for you.

1442
01:08:03,917 --> 01:08:06,378
Listen, Marty,
I need to see her.

1443
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,338
She doesn't
want to see you.

1444
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:11,008
I really have to
speak to her, O.K.?

1445
01:08:11,091 --> 01:08:12,634
I want her back.

1446
01:08:12,718 --> 01:08:14,970
That's going to take
a lot of convincing.

1447
01:08:15,053 --> 01:08:16,513
Do something for me.

1448
01:08:16,597 --> 01:08:19,016
Just, um...organize
a chance meeting.

1449
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:21,059
Bring her
to a grocery store

1450
01:08:21,101 --> 01:08:23,145
or a restaurant,
and I'm there.

1451
01:08:23,228 --> 01:08:25,314
I don't know.

1452
01:08:25,397 --> 01:08:28,025
Ask Gail if I could
baby-sit your kids Saturday.

1453
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:30,068
You want to baby-sit
my kids?

1454
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:31,320
Yes! It's brilliant.

1455
01:08:31,361 --> 01:08:33,530
It will convince Rebecca
that I like children.

1456
01:08:33,614 --> 01:08:36,325
That will get me
in trouble with Gail,

1457
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:39,369
and you know
how mad she gets.

1458
01:08:39,453 --> 01:08:41,872
Marty, please
do this for me!

1459
01:08:41,914 --> 01:08:43,832
O.K., O.K.,
I will.

01:09:22,913 --> 01:09:24,122
Higher!

1475
01:09:24,206 --> 01:09:25,374
Yes. Higher.

1476
01:09:25,457 --> 01:09:28,210
Now, Patsy, no.
That's not funny, my love.

1477
01:09:28,293 --> 01:09:29,962
Don't strangle
the little boy.

1478
01:09:30,045 --> 01:09:31,463
But he likes it!

1479
01:09:31,547 --> 01:09:33,090
Say uncle!

1480
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:34,466
Just...
Yes, that's it.

1481
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:36,385
Hey, Sam! Sam!

1482
01:09:36,468 --> 01:09:37,719
Oof !.

1483
01:09:37,803 --> 01:09:40,973
Shit.
Sam, are you O.K.?

1484
01:09:41,056 --> 01:09:42,724
Great. Fine.

1485
01:09:42,808 --> 01:09:44,309
Are you all right?

1486
01:09:44,393 --> 01:09:45,644
Yeah, yeah. Good.

1487
01:09:45,727 --> 01:09:47,479
We're getting on
well here.

1488
01:09:47,563 --> 01:09:48,939
Is Rebecca coming?

1489
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:50,315
No.

1490
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,901
No? Marty,
we had an agreement.

1491
01:09:52,943 --> 01:09:54,611
She's
in the hospital, Sam.

1492
01:09:54,695 --> 01:09:55,988
The hospital?

1493
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:57,990
Why? What's wrong?

1494
01:09:58,073 --> 01:10:00,659
There might be a problem
with the pregnancy.

1495
01:10:00,742 --> 01:10:02,327
What are you
talking about?

1496
01:10:02,411 --> 01:10:05,330
The doctors don't know,
but she's with them.

1497
01:10:05,414 --> 01:10:06,498
Jesus Christ.

1498
01:10:06,582 --> 01:10:08,542
Be careful, Sam!

1499
01:10:14,423 --> 01:10:17,176
Hi. Which room is
Rebecca Taylor in, please?

1500
01:10:17,259 --> 01:10:18,343
61 5.

1501
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:19,511
Where's that?

1502
01:10:19,595 --> 01:10:20,846
Just around
the corner.

1503
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:25,517
Gail!

1504
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:26,727
So?

1505
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:28,270
Will she be
all right?

1506
01:10:28,312 --> 01:10:29,855
Yeah, she's
going to be fine.

1507
01:10:29,938 --> 01:10:31,315
Oh!

1508
01:10:31,356 --> 01:10:34,109
Shejust started
having some contractions,

1509
01:10:34,151 --> 01:10:35,652
and she started dilating.

1510
01:10:35,694 --> 01:10:37,654
They'll keep her overnight,
restrict her movement.

1511
01:10:37,696 --> 01:10:40,782
It just sometimes happens
in the seventh month.

1512
01:10:40,866 --> 01:10:42,493
And the baby's O.K.?

1513
01:10:42,576 --> 01:10:44,828
Yeah. Baby's great.

1514
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:50,250
So...can I see her?

1515
01:10:51,877 --> 01:10:53,629
Don't upset her.

1516
01:10:53,712 --> 01:10:55,339
I won't.

1517
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:56,840
Promise?

1518
01:10:56,882 --> 01:10:58,133
Yep. Promise.

1519
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:01,345
O.K.

1520
01:11:01,386 --> 01:11:02,888
Thanks.

1521
01:11:12,564 --> 01:11:13,649
Hi.

1522
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:15,025
Hi.

1523
01:11:19,905 --> 01:11:22,199
What are you
doing here?

1524
01:11:22,282 --> 01:11:25,369
Well, you know I was
worried about...

1525
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:27,704
about you
and the baby.

1526
01:11:29,373 --> 01:11:31,834
We're going to be fine.

1527
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:33,961
Yeah. That's
what Gail said.

1528
01:11:37,756 --> 01:11:40,509
[Beeping]

1529
01:11:42,219 --> 01:11:44,680
Is this...
is this noise--

1530
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:48,308
Is that the baby's
heartbeat?

1531
01:11:48,392 --> 01:11:50,519
Yeah.

1532
01:11:50,561 --> 01:11:52,354
Strong.

1533
01:11:52,437 --> 01:11:53,814
Yeah.

1534
01:11:58,902 --> 01:12:00,779
Beck, I'm sorry.

1535
01:12:02,406 --> 01:12:04,616
I'm so sorry.

1536
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:09,454
I was, um...
a disgrace.

1537
01:12:09,538 --> 01:12:12,332
I mean,
I know now exactly

1538
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:14,334
what a bastard
I was.

1539
01:12:14,418 --> 01:12:16,336
I was...I was...
completely selfish,

1540
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:17,838
and you had
absolutely

1541
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:19,339
every right

1542
01:12:19,423 --> 01:12:21,341
to walk out on me.

1543
01:12:22,926 --> 01:12:25,804
But I just want
you to reconsider.

1544
01:12:25,888 --> 01:12:28,265
Sam, please, no--

1545
01:12:28,307 --> 01:12:29,808
Let mejust explain.

1546
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:31,310
I think--

1547
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:33,228
I know
that I've changed.

1548
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:35,772
You don't believe
in change.

1549
01:12:35,814 --> 01:12:37,774
I do now.
Change is great.

1550
01:12:37,858 --> 01:12:39,818
Change is what
it's all about.

1551
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:42,279
Anyone who doesn't believe
in change is a coward,

1552
01:12:42,362 --> 01:12:44,114
which is what I was.

1553
01:12:44,156 --> 01:12:47,159
I was scared.
I was scared of ...

1554
01:12:47,201 --> 01:12:48,785
of  losing control

1555
01:12:48,869 --> 01:12:50,829
and of  losing,
you know,

1556
01:12:50,871 --> 01:12:53,790
you or what
we had together

1557
01:12:53,874 --> 01:12:56,293
and losing myyouth.

1558
01:12:56,376 --> 01:12:58,921
Aren't you now?

1559
01:12:59,004 --> 01:13:01,465
No. No, especially
not myyouth.

1560
01:13:01,548 --> 01:13:03,091
My youth is here,

1561
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:05,302
doing well.

1562
01:13:05,385 --> 01:13:07,805
I'd really love
to believe this.

1563
01:13:07,888 --> 01:13:09,306
Listen, I've seen

1564
01:13:09,389 --> 01:13:10,849
the second
ultrasound--

1565
01:13:10,891 --> 01:13:13,310
The one you left
at Dr. Thatcher's

1566
01:13:13,393 --> 01:13:15,312
the day I was late.

1567
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:17,815
The point is,
I don't care

1568
01:13:17,898 --> 01:13:20,359
what I think or
don't think anymore.

1569
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,820
I don't give
a damn about me.

1570
01:13:24,404 --> 01:13:26,615
I'm in love
with my child.

1571
01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:28,700
You are?

1572
01:13:30,369 --> 01:13:34,081
And I'm completely in love
with you for having it.

1573
01:13:35,499 --> 01:13:38,293
Samuel, you almost
ruined everything, and--

1574
01:13:38,377 --> 01:13:40,337
Shh. Please.

1575
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:42,297
It's
the seventh month.

1576
01:13:42,339 --> 01:13:44,341
The baby
can hearyou.

1577
01:13:44,383 --> 01:13:46,969
How do you know that?

1578
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:48,804
I've been
reading up--

1579
01:13:48,887 --> 01:13:50,305
Dr. Brazelton,

1580
01:13:50,389 --> 01:13:52,307
What To Expect When
You're Expecting.

1581
01:13:52,349 --> 01:13:54,309
I've been
to a Lamaze class.

1582
01:13:54,351 --> 01:13:56,770
I was the only
single father there.

1583
01:13:56,854 --> 01:13:57,980
Really?

1584
01:13:58,021 --> 01:13:59,648
And I sold
the Porsche.

1585
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:01,441
Oh, I don't believe that.

1586
01:14:01,525 --> 01:14:03,819
Yep. Marty gave me
a terrible deal

1587
01:14:03,861 --> 01:14:05,654
on a big family car.

1588
01:14:05,737 --> 01:14:06,822
He did?

1589
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:08,323
Yes.
It's parked outside.

1590
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:10,325
Car seat,
family extras.

1591
01:14:11,702 --> 01:14:13,829
It just needs
a family.

1592
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:19,418
And, um...

1593
01:14:22,379 --> 01:14:23,797
there's this.

1594
01:14:33,724 --> 01:14:35,476
Open it.

1595
01:14:45,903 --> 01:14:48,864
Would you be my wife?

1596
01:14:51,408 --> 01:14:52,701
Yes.

1597
01:15:01,585 --> 01:15:03,337
Yes!

1598
01:15:06,548 --> 01:15:08,467
On one condition.

1599
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:10,677
O.K.

1600
01:15:10,761 --> 01:15:12,429

01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,152
thank you.

1621
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:09,653
I've always wanted

1622
01:16:09,736 --> 01:16:11,655
to be carried
over a threshold.

1623
01:16:11,738 --> 01:16:12,823
Unh.

1624
01:16:12,906 --> 01:16:14,324
Are you all right?

1625
01:16:14,408 --> 01:16:16,827
Yeah. I've got
something to show you.

1626
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:17,995
Yeah?

1627
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:29,006
Oh, Samuel.

1628
01:16:32,843 --> 01:16:34,803
It's...

1629
01:16:34,845 --> 01:16:37,264
It's beautiful.

1630
01:16:37,347 --> 01:16:40,309
You did this
all byyourself?

1631
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:42,478
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

1632
01:16:44,354 --> 01:16:45,814
thank you.

1633
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:51,320
It's perfect.

1634
01:17:05,876 --> 01:17:07,836
How are you feeling,
love?

1635
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,338
Oh, O.K.

1636
01:17:09,379 --> 01:17:11,340
My feet are
really swollen.

1637
01:17:11,381 --> 01:17:13,342
My back's killing me.

1638
01:17:13,383 --> 01:17:14,843
Well, look.

Leave this to me.

I'm going to pull
a few strings.

All right.

Hi. Look, I'm sorry
to bother you.

1643
01:17:25,354 --> 01:17:27,981
My wife's pregnant,
she's due in two weeks,

1644
01:17:28,065 --> 01:17:29,775
and I was wondering...

1645

Lili.

1646
01:17:32,653 --> 01:17:34,613
Samuel. Oh.

1647
01:17:34,696 --> 01:17:36,281
Hi. What a coincidence.

1648
01:17:36,365 --> 01:17:37,950
How-- How long-- How long--

1649
01:17:38,033 --> 01:17:40,285
How long have you
been working here?

1650
01:17:40,369 --> 01:17:41,787
Three weeks.

1651
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:43,789

01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:45,290
How are things?

1654
01:17:51,505 --> 01:17:53,298
Obviously.

1655
01:17:53,382 --> 01:17:54,800
So listen, Lili,

1656
01:17:54,883 --> 01:17:58,303
how long is the wait
for a table going to be?

1657
01:17:58,387 --> 01:17:59,972
Give me
a few minutes.

1658
01:18:00,055 --> 01:18:01,765
I'll seat you
right away.

1659

Well, succes.

1662
01:18:08,897 --> 01:18:10,983
She's just setting
the table now.

1663
01:18:11,066 --> 01:18:12,317
You know her?

1664
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:13,527
Who?

1665
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:14,945
The hostess.

1666
01:18:15,028 --> 01:18:16,822
The hostess?

1667
01:18:16,905 --> 01:18:19,575
I've never seen her
before in my life.

1668

Samuel!

1669
01:18:26,123 --> 01:18:27,916
She called you Samuel.

1670
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,251
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1671
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:30,794
That's my name.

1672
01:18:30,878 --> 01:18:33,297
Yeah, but you're
on a first-name basis

1673
01:18:33,338 --> 01:18:35,549
with a woman you've
never seen before?

1674
01:18:35,632 --> 01:18:37,926
Well, she took
my first name. See?

1675
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:39,761
Some places take
the first name.

1676
01:18:39,845 --> 01:18:41,680
Some places,
they use last names.

1677
01:18:41,763 --> 01:18:43,432
Here, they use
first names.

1678
01:18:43,515 --> 01:18:44,475
Oh.

1679
01:18:44,516 --> 01:18:45,601
You're silly.

1680
01:18:45,684 --> 01:18:46,768
You're paranoid.

Hang on.
This is quite serious.

01:19:05,537 --> 01:19:06,788
That needs stitches.

No. My water broke.

Yeah.

That's right.

01:19:31,021 --> 01:19:32,815
at some bloody

You slept with her,
didn't you,

01:19:44,201 --> 01:19:46,286
while we were apart?

1713
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:47,788
It was completely
innocent.

Nothing happened.

completely faithful?

If it was innocent,

1720
01:19:57,339 --> 01:19:59,466
why did you lie
about knowing her?

1721
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:03,262
Because you were
in a fragile state.

01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:30,219
I'll get the doctor.

1807
01:23:30,302 --> 01:23:31,470
How are you?

1808
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:32,721
The baby's ready.

1809
01:23:32,805 --> 01:23:34,389
What do you mean,
ready?

1810
01:23:34,473 --> 01:23:35,724
To come out!

1811
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:37,267
Jesus Christ almighty,

1812
01:23:37,309 --> 01:23:38,977
where is
the bloody doctor?

1813
01:23:39,061 --> 01:23:40,938
Here I am.

1814
01:23:40,979 --> 01:23:42,231
- Aah!
- Aah!

1815
01:23:42,314 --> 01:23:43,690
Please don't do that.

1816
01:23:43,774 --> 01:23:45,234
No. No.

1817
01:23:45,317 --> 01:23:46,777
Hi. Where's Dr. Green?

1818
01:23:46,819 --> 01:23:48,487
Where's our doctor?

1819
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:49,780
Miami.

1820
01:23:49,822 --> 01:23:52,574
He's on vacation.
You are two weeks early.

1821
01:23:52,658 --> 01:23:55,244
You're not the replacement
doctor, are you?

1822
01:23:55,327 --> 01:23:56,453
Yes, I am.

1823
01:23:56,537 --> 01:23:58,664
No. No.

1824
01:23:58,747 --> 01:24:00,207
I want
someone else.

1825
01:24:00,249 --> 01:24:01,625
There is nobody else.

1826
01:24:01,667 --> 01:24:03,919
There must be!
Find me another doctor!

1827
01:24:04,002 --> 01:24:06,338
There's no one else!
All right?

1828
01:24:06,421 --> 01:24:07,923
It is a full moon.

1829
01:24:08,006 --> 01:24:10,384
Everybody has gone into labor.
Look around!

1830
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:13,095
There are not enough
doctors and nurses.

1831
01:24:13,178 --> 01:24:15,055
There are not
enough delivery rooms.

1832
01:24:15,139 --> 01:24:17,766
Unless you want to deliver
this baby yourself,

1833
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:19,560
follow me!

1834
01:24:19,643 --> 01:24:21,228
Ow!

1835
01:24:21,311 --> 01:24:23,272
Oh, God! I'm O.K.

1836
01:24:23,355 --> 01:24:25,315
I'm a little nervous,
O.K.?

1837
01:24:25,357 --> 01:24:27,317
It's my first delivery.

1838
01:24:29,736 --> 01:24:31,405
Ifthere aren't
any rooms,

1839
01:24:31,488 --> 01:24:33,407
where is she
having the baby?

1840
01:24:33,490 --> 01:24:35,409
I'll put her
with another patient.

1841
01:24:35,492 --> 01:24:36,743
We're sharing a room?

1842
01:24:36,827 --> 01:24:39,454
I'm sorry. We're a little
overbooked, O.K.?

1843
01:24:39,538 --> 01:24:40,789
Let's go. Let's go.

1844
01:24:40,873 --> 01:24:42,082
Get this woman

1845
01:24:42,166 --> 01:24:43,750
on the delivery table
immediately,

1846
01:24:43,834 --> 01:24:44,960
if not later.

1847
01:24:45,043 --> 01:24:46,253
Come on. Let's go.

1848
01:24:46,336 --> 01:24:47,963
Where are you taking me?

1849
01:24:48,046 --> 01:24:50,132
You're looking good.

1850
01:24:50,215 --> 01:24:51,925
You're dilated
to 7 centimeters.

1851
01:24:52,009 --> 01:24:53,343
How much is that?

1852
01:24:53,427 --> 01:24:54,845
O.K.? Got it?

1853
01:24:54,887 --> 01:24:56,597
She's very good, O.K.?

1854
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,056
You look uncomfortable.

1855
01:24:58,098 --> 01:25:00,100
I'm going
to raise you down.

1856
01:25:00,184 --> 01:25:01,852
No! Don't touch
anything!

1857
01:25:01,894 --> 01:25:03,937
All right.
Get somebody over here!

1858
01:25:04,021 --> 01:25:05,105
Hey, buddy.

1859
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:06,273
No!

1860
01:25:06,356 --> 01:25:07,941
What are you doing here?

1861
01:25:08,025 --> 01:25:09,276
I'm cruising
for chicks.

1862
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:10,819
I'm having a baby!

1863
01:25:10,903 --> 01:25:12,696
Hi. Hi!

1864
01:25:12,738 --> 01:25:14,781
How you feeling?

1865
01:25:14,865 --> 01:25:16,950
Isn't this terrible,
just terrible?

1866
01:25:17,034 --> 01:25:18,285
Sounds very good.

1867
01:25:18,368 --> 01:25:19,620
Where's my husband?

1868
01:25:19,703 --> 01:25:21,663
It's a full moon!

1869
01:25:21,747 --> 01:25:23,332
Women are
spouting them out!

1870
01:25:23,415 --> 01:25:24,791
Good.
Everybody's old friends.

1871
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:26,126
Back to work!

1872
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:27,336
Smile, Doc.

1873
01:25:27,419 --> 01:25:28,545
How's she doing?

1874
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:30,297
Great.
God bless America, O.K.?

1875
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:31,757
Ooh...

1876
01:25:31,799 --> 01:25:33,258
Honey, smile for me.

1877
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,886
I love you. Smile.
You're so beautiful.

1878
01:25:35,969 --> 01:25:38,680
It's not bad, is it?
It doesn't hurt.

1879
01:25:38,764 --> 01:25:40,724
I want something
for the pain.

1880
01:25:40,808 --> 01:25:42,768
O.K. I'll get you
something.

1881
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:44,269
Knock me out!

1882
01:25:44,311 --> 01:25:47,898
Knock me ow-ow-ow...

1883
01:25:47,981 --> 01:25:49,900
Give her something
for the pain!

1884
01:25:49,983 --> 01:25:51,735
You don't want
natural childbirth?

1885
01:25:51,819 --> 01:25:52,986
No!

1886
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:55,072
O.K.
You want Anastasia?

1887
01:25:55,155 --> 01:25:56,073
What?

1888
01:25:56,156 --> 01:25:57,241
Drugs, yes?

1889
01:25:57,324 --> 01:25:58,242
Yes!

1890
01:25:58,325 --> 01:26:00,202
Give me a moment.
I'm thinking.

1891
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:01,912
You mean
you don't know?

1892
01:26:01,995 --> 01:26:02,955
Kind of .

1893
01:26:02,996 --> 01:26:04,456
Think,
you Commie bastard!

1894
01:26:04,498 --> 01:26:06,250
Shut up,
you Limey prick!

1895
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:07,584
Sorry.

1896
01:26:07,668 --> 01:26:09,253
I can't take
the pressure.

1897
01:26:09,336 --> 01:26:10,671
Don't yell at me.

1898
01:26:10,754 --> 01:26:12,756
Yes. Yes. It's fine.

1899
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:13,924
Oh...

1900
01:26:14,007 --> 01:26:15,467
Valium.

1901
01:26:15,509 --> 01:26:17,177
Valium's
no good for her!

1902
01:26:17,261 --> 01:26:18,428
No, for me!

1903
01:26:18,512 --> 01:26:19,429
No!

1904
01:26:19,513 --> 01:26:20,597
I've got it!

1905
01:26:20,681 --> 01:26:21,932
Oh, thank God!

1906
01:26:22,015 --> 01:26:24,309
Nurse,
call the anesthesiologist.

1907
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:26,270
This woman needs an enema.

1908
01:26:26,353 --> 01:26:27,271
An enema?

1909
01:26:27,354 --> 01:26:28,355
- Enema?
- Enema?

1910
01:26:28,438 --> 01:26:30,816
No. Uh...
she needs a pedicure!

1911
01:26:30,858 --> 01:26:32,860
This ain't
no beauty parlor.

1912
01:26:32,943 --> 01:26:34,069
Epitaph.

1913
01:26:34,153 --> 01:26:36,238
She's not dead,
you moron!

1914
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,115
Epidermis?
What is it, Epilady?

1915
01:26:38,157 --> 01:26:39,867
Epidural, asshole!

1916
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:42,619
That's right! Yes!
That's what I mean.

1917
01:26:42,703 --> 01:26:44,788
Epidural.
Epidural.

1918
01:26:44,830 --> 01:26:46,415
I always
get those confused--

1919
01:26:46,498 --> 01:26:47,916
enema, pedicure, epidermal.

1920
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,793
I should buy myself
a clitoris.

1921
01:26:49,877 --> 01:26:51,086
A thesaurus.

1922
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:53,297
You don't know
what a clitoris is.

1923
01:26:53,338 --> 01:26:55,924
What are you doing?
Go away from here.

1924
01:26:56,008 --> 01:26:58,135
I'm proud of you.
I love you.

1925
01:26:58,177 --> 01:27:00,137
I hate you!

1926
01:27:00,179 --> 01:27:02,764
You did this to me,

1927
01:27:02,848 --> 01:27:05,767
you miserable piece of
dick-brained horseshit

1928
01:27:05,809 --> 01:27:09,938
slime-sucking
son of a whore bitch!

1929
01:27:10,022 --> 01:27:11,440
That's perfect,
sweetheart.

1930
01:27:11,523 --> 01:27:14,109
The kids will love it.
I'll put it--

1931
01:27:14,193 --> 01:27:15,277
Ooh!

1932
01:27:15,319 --> 01:27:18,280
Get out! Get out!
You're the one!

1933
01:27:18,363 --> 01:27:19,615
You are the one!

1934
01:27:19,698 --> 01:27:21,283
Hi, everyone.
I'm Dr. Newsoe.

1935
01:27:21,366 --> 01:27:23,285
I'm here to administer
the epidural.

1936
01:27:23,368 --> 01:27:25,287
[Rebecca]
Oh, yes! Thank God!

1937
01:27:25,329 --> 01:27:27,789
You inject that thing
into my wife?

1938
01:27:27,873 --> 01:27:30,501
Mm-hmm.
Right into her spine.

1939
01:27:30,584 --> 01:27:33,045
Mm-hmm. Good. Excellent.

1940
01:27:33,086 --> 01:27:35,214
[Rebecca]
Whoa...hey!

1941
01:27:35,297 --> 01:27:37,257
[Dr. Kosevich]
Look, you see?

1942
01:27:37,341 --> 01:27:39,718
That is why women
have the babies--

1943
01:27:39,802 --> 01:27:42,513
because men
can't handle the pa-aa--

1944
01:27:42,554 --> 01:27:44,389
Hey, you guys!

1945
01:27:44,431 --> 01:27:45,724
Get some smelling salts

1946
01:27:45,808 --> 01:27:48,393
and get these men up
of fthe floor!

1947
01:27:48,477 --> 01:27:50,729
[Rebecca]
Help me! Help me!

1948
01:27:52,314 --> 01:27:55,234
I need some help.
I need some help.

1949
01:27:55,317 --> 01:27:56,735
Oh!

1950
01:27:56,819 --> 01:27:58,237
- Aah!
- Aah!

1951
01:27:58,278 --> 01:27:59,863
No time
for an epidural.

1952
01:27:59,947 --> 01:28:00,948
Why?

1953
01:28:01,031 --> 01:28:02,241
No time, Doctor.

1954
01:28:02,324 --> 01:28:05,035
I checked her cervix.
She's dilated to 10.

1955
01:28:05,118 --> 01:28:08,580
Doctor, this woman
is also dilated to 10.

1956
01:28:08,664 --> 01:28:09,957
Hi, everybody.
Smile big!

1957
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,583
Give me a smile.

1958
01:28:11,667 --> 01:28:13,043
What are you doing?

1959
01:28:13,126 --> 01:28:15,671
I'm making you a souvenir.
Isn't it great?

1960
01:28:15,754 --> 01:28:17,631
Get that thing
off her face!

1961
01:28:17,714 --> 01:28:19,258
Give it to me!

1962
01:28:19,341 --> 01:28:22,302
No! I got a great shot
of the head!

1963
01:28:22,386 --> 01:28:24,346
Asshole.

1964
01:28:24,429 --> 01:28:26,014
You broke my camera.

1965
01:28:26,098 --> 01:28:27,724
Ooh!

1966
01:28:27,766 --> 01:28:29,560
Oh, Sam, I'm sorry.

1967
01:28:29,601 --> 01:28:31,061
