1
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,299
One hundred girls.

2
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,387
And one of them
is my true love.

3
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,973
My forever soul mate.

4
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,475
The Betty to my Barney.

5
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,561
My cosmetic destiny.

6
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,022
The problem is...

7
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,858
I don't know who she is.

8
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,530
I was leaving a highball bash
in the girl's dorm.

9
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,123
Can you hit the
basement button, please?

10
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:09,046
My back was to her when
that auspicious blackout hit.

11
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,965
I never got a chance
to see her.

12
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:20,599
It must've been the cloak of darkness
concealing my usual romantic block.

13
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:25,103
Because that night I was smart,
I was funny, I was invincible

14
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,440
Did you ever notice in the movie "Willy
Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"...

15
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,109
that the 0ompa Loompas
never wore hairnets?

16
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,821
Do you know what I really hate?
Those stickers they put on apples.

17
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,866
By the time you peel it off,
you don't want the apple anymore.

18
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:41,203
I sometimes wish I could
just crawl up with a girl.

19
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:45,082
Just hold each other. Like that picture
of John Lennon and Yoko 0no.

20
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,835
That is so sweet.

21
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,170
And that's when it happened.

22
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,928
Our tongues tangled.

23
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:02,182
And our hands began displaying
their in credible night vision.

24
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,605
Her little breasts were
just the right size to fill...

25
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,024
a champagne glass.

26
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:29,710
My impressive man hood in my pants
expanded like popcorn.

27
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,220
We never knew
each other's names.

28
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:45,225
Maybe it was the mystery of if all
that made it so exciting.

29
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,568
in the morning...

30
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,242
she was gone.

31
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,123
I had to find her.

32
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:11,627
I didn't get much support
from my roommate Rod.

33
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,880
What you're getting so bad
out of shape for, man?

34
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:20,552
- I mean, it's just a girl.
- I should've expected you to say that.

35
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,514
- What do you mean?
- I mean you're the kind of guy...

36
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,808
who likes those silhouettes of naked
women on the mud flaps of trucks.

37
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:30,479
You play video games watching a porn
movie on the picture and picture.

38
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,149
- You revel in the size of your dumps.
- Hey, Matt!

39
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,068
You gotta check this out!

40
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,820
Yeah, I do all those things.

41
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:43,158
This isn't just another girl, Rod.
I connected with her.

42
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:47,621
The last intimate encounter I had
with a woman was when I was five.

43
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,500
Id pulled down my pants, and
Vickie poured sand on my winky.

44
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,003
This is better than playing
with you shovel, man.

45
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,048
Ever since then, I've had this
burning need for a woman.

46
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,676
When I was 10 years old,
I liked getting a boner so much...

47
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:04,555
I started taping my pecker so that
it would stay up all the time.

48
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,599
I did the same thing,
but I used duct tape, man.

49
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,310
Shut up, I'm trying
to make a point here.

50
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,855
I've never had this kind of
success with a woman before.

51
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:16,108
When I was 16, I tried talking to girls.
I had to write myself cheat notes...

52
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,486
on my hands so I had a list of topics
I could talk to the girls about.

53
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,989
- What's that on your hand?
- Nothing.

54
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:27,119
My romantic IQ must've mashed me,
because I showed the girl my list.

55
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,163
It's all sorts of things
I can talk to you about.

56
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,209
I thought I was the
biggest loser of all time.

57
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,379
It wasn't as bad as senior prom,
when I spent US$ 150 on Emily...

58
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,882
and didn't even get
a kiss of good night.

59
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,510
So you can imagine how impassioned
I feel now I've actually met this girl.

60
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,847
You're pathetic, man!
I mean, you lose your virginity...

61
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,850
and you don't even get
the girl's name!

62
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,854
- What the hell is that?
- It's penile power, man.

63
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,940
I got it out of an ad
in a magazine, you know?

64
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:01,570
It's gonna help me increase length
and girth by hanging weights, man!

65
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,867
- Check it out, I'm up to 5 pounds.
- It's the stroker, not the poker.

66
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,995
Man, I'm doing this for me.
Like I always say...

67
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:13,290
"The angle of the dangle
equals the cubic of the pubic".

68
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:18,253
- What's that have to do with anything?
- I don't know. I just like to say it.

69
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:22,925
This penile power thing is gonna
help me increase my libido...

70
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,469
help me maintain
a full firm erection...

71
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,805
and it's gonna help me
control my ejaculation, baby.

72
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:33,060
- So I'm gonna do it all night long!
- When do you start junior high?

73
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:36,230
No, man, look here. I'm serious.
It works. Check this out.

74
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,483
This is Kung Chang, right?
Master of penile power.

75
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:43,362
Look. He's lifting 500 pounds
with his penis, man!

76
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,615
Great, that's useful! is he gonna
enter himself in a tractor pull?

77
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,784
Whatever, man.

78
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,453
So what are you gonna
do about this girl?

79
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,666
- She left this.
- Hey, man, let me see that!

80
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,922
No...

81
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,884
...I don't recognize this one.
- Hey, give them back!

82
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:12,474
What are you gonna do? You're
gonna boil them and make soup?

83
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,144
You don't want
a girlfriend. Jesus.

84
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:21,608
And then there's the other thing.
You'd spend every Friday night...

85
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:26,488
watching movies adapted from
the latest Jane Austen book.

86
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,783
- You don't want that, man!
- It's pretty cold, Rod.

87
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:33,704
Listen, when it comes to men
and women, men get a raw deal.

88
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:37,958
For centuries, we've been killing
over 15 years before our wives...

89
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:42,129
and all because of all the stress
in the work place, right?

90
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,631
But not once have they
apologized, man...

91
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:48,427
for all the millions of years
of life we've lost working...

92
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,096
while women stayed home.

93
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,850
I couldn't understand why
Rod hated women so much.

94
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:59,646
I suspected there was some past
horror that made him this way.

95
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:06,403
Man, all you gotta do is find the
matching bra to those panties.

96
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:11,325
- Mystery solved!
- That's not a half bad idea.

97
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,413
You're never gonna get
in the Virgin Vault, man.

98
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:19,333
They don't let boys in
the girls' side, alright?

99
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,085
- No, this will work.
- You're high, man.

100
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:26,715
0n my own testosterone, maybe.
Come with me.

101
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:34,389
What are you doing, man?

102
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,351
Rod, I focused all my
great cerebral powers...

103
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,479
to come up with this bold plan
to penetrate the Vault.

104
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:46,068
What are you?
Coyote super genius or something?

105
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,153
Something like that.

106
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,865
Wait! The Coyote never
caught the Roadrunner, man!

107
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,093
Got you!

108
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,932
Hi, I'm Matt, the new
maintenance man.

109
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,810
Had a call about some rats.

110
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,235
Man in the hall!

111
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,196
Getting my female suspects
just about off their rooms...

112
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:35,075
was as easy as giving away
free hair-care products to girls.

113
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,828
It was as if I was a perverted
Prince Charming.

114
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,582
instead of Cinderella's glass
slippers, I had her panties

115
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:36,970
I miss you. What you mean,
you just wanna be friends?

116
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:40,474
- Get off me!
- Put that away and give me some.

117
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:44,520
- It's gonna be okay. Come on, baby.
- Jesus, can't you see I'm busy?!

118
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,898
- Put that stupid shit away, alright?
- Crick, get off!

119
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,652
It's time to give
me some, alright?

120
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,862
Just relax, alright?

121
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,864
You stapled my ass!

122
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,158
- What are you doing?
- Stop it!

123
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,203
He was gonna kill me.
I just hoped to get in...

124
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,872
a few verbal punches before
he went Mike Tyson on me.

125
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:07,376
- Who are you?
- I'm Matthew. Your name's Crick.

126
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:10,838
As in "Crick without a paddle".
I've seen you around.

127
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,841
- You're a natural born hipster.
- Natural born hipster?

128
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:17,010
The next evolution of a jock.
You traded in your letterman jacket...

129
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:20,055
for a manicured goatee
and an Euro trash ponytail.

130
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:23,225
You're the worst kind of cool,
the kind who wears male make-up.

131
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,394
A real fashion plate.

132
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:29,857
You're living proof of those boy-toy
do of uses in those men's magazines!

133
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:33,110
I was a goner.
But better me than her.

134
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,321
What was the worse? Crick was
hopped upon nicotine gum.

135
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,616
A chain-chewer. And he chewed
his gum with his mouth open.

136
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:42,369
I hated that noise.
It was my kryptonite

137
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:46,373
What the hell are
you doing here?

138
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,750
- I'm here so save her.
- Save her?

139
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,837
How are you gonna do that?

140
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:56,008
Crick wasn't wearing a shirt.
His nipples stood out like knobs...

141
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:59,845
on an old TV.
I don't know what possessed me.

142
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:03,265
Probably his incessant
nicotine-gum chewing.

143
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,020
But my hands reached out like
they were drawing twin guns.

144
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,608
I grabbed his nipples
and did a double twist.

145
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:26,997
But, somehow, through his blur
of pain, Crick fought back.

146
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,751
He grabbed my nipples
and twisted.

147
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,712
It was tit for tat.

148
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:38,175
So we faced each other.
Locked in a nipple combat.

149
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,428
Each trying to endure the
retching pains the longest.

150
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,973
Each of us waiting
for the other to blink.

151
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,486
And... I cracked.

152
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:07,454
I'll be back for your ass!
And I'll deal with you later!

153
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,631
Here, have some Midol.

154
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,802
It does the trick when my nipples
get sore during my period.

155
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,804
Thanks.

156
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:28,058
Let me see.

157
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,646
They're all bruised.

158
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,108
They are two black eyes.

159
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,986
We should put
something cold on them.

160
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:44,992
- You're bruised too.
- Don't worry, I'm used to it.

161
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:50,539
You're Patty, huh? You do that
comic in the school newspaper.

162
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,918
- That's me.
- An art- school girl, huh?

163
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,714
- Is that what you call me?
- No, I wasn't calling you anything.

164
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,633
in high school,
you would have called me a slut.

165
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,219
Now in college,
you call me a good time.

166
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,229
You like my skirt,
but you're thinking:

167
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:18,317
"lf her skirt were any shorter,
she'd have other cheeks to powder...

168
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,861
and would have to put gloss
on another pair of lips".

169
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:25,949
I wasn't thinking any of that.
I think you're a nice girl.

170
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,286
I was lying.
I did think all those things.

171
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:34,583
She may not be perfect, but she oozed
sex more than a sponge contraceptive.

172
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:40,214
She had a cuteness that set off
my hair-trigger response.

173
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:43,675
She got my pecker to strain
like a dog on a leash.

174
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:01,443
What?
What's wrong?

175
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,780
- Nothing, I'm sorry.
- I'm trying to make it all better.

176
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,449
No. I'm all better.

177
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:13,413
- You don't like me.
- No. I like you just fine.

178
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,333
You're worried about
what people say about me.

179
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,002
I've never heard anything.

180
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:23,632
Sure you have. "lf she still has a
cherry, it must be pushed so back...

181
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:27,594
...she can use it as a taillight".
- I've never heard that.

182
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:31,390
Yes, you have.
My reputation precedes me.

183
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:36,603
It's okay. You know,
I'm all for experimentation.

184
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:43,485
What are these?
Are these stress balls?

185
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:48,782
To relieve tension, like Humphrey
Bogart did in that old movie.

186
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,785
"There's three ways to do
things aboard my vessel.

187
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,954
The right way, the wrong way
and my way.

188
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,498
If you do things my way,
we'll get along just fine".

189
00:15:56,957 --> 00:16:00,335
- Those are my pinball balls.
- What?

190
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:05,799
Pinball balls. I put them inside of me,
I rock my legs and I get off.

191
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,594
Really?

192
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:12,973
0kay, I'm sorry,
I have to go.

193
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:26,320
- Hey, Matt.
- What's the matter with you?

194
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,447
Penile power.

195
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:33,827
It seems to be causing a little pain,
if you know what I mean.

196
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:38,498
- So what's plan B, Mr. Coyote?
- I'm gonna continue searching.

197
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,337
Everyday, between classes and
homework, I'll create a problem.

198
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,005
So they let me into fixit.

199
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,549
Man in the hall!

200
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:00,812
Once inside, I just figure out
a way to get in the girls' rooms.

201
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:06,068
Hello. This is Phil Gambone
calling from KR0K radio.

202
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,321
You won the morning prize.
A new car.

203
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:12,241
You should've been there the day
I turned the air-conditioner off.

204
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,910
It was a feast for the eyes!

205
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:24,461
And there was Cynthia Dessert,
the "crème" of womanhood.

206
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:29,383
She loomed as a titan in
my masturbatory dreams.

207
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:33,554
She's the perfect example of
the power women holdover men.

208
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:37,933
We're paralyzed by their beauty.
We're rendered speechless by it.

209
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,270
If we're lucky to say anything to
them, it all sounds like gibberish.

210
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:44,231
You're Matt,
the maintenance guy, right?

211
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,903
I need some help in my room.

212
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:54,575
How can a guy have a real
conversation with a girl like this...

213
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,743
when we're made so helpless?

214
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,330
In the animal kingdom, when
2members stare at each other...

215
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,624
it is a test of dominance.

216
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,253
The first one to look away
is considered the weaker.

217
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:12,134
Between a man and a woman,
cards are stacked against the man.

218
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:16,013
Because, let's face it,
every time a guy meets a girl...

219
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:18,849
he wants to check out
her breasts.

220
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:23,854
A man must summon all his will not
to lookdown at those golden orbs...

221
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:27,733
whose wondrous tips are upturned,
aimed right at his eyes.

222
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,705
Once a man loses
this test of nerves...

223
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:45,000
the woman knows she has
a great secret power over him...

224
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,461
and she can get him
to do anything she wants.

225
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:51,465
Like a sexual sorceress, Cynthia
had several men under her spell.

226
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,301
You can use my desk-top PC
anytime you want, all semester.

227
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,845
I have an extra pizza.
I thought you might want it.

228
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:00,599
When you're done, I just need
some help moving some furniture.

229
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,480
Thanks for getting this
masterpiece theater!

230
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:10,484
- Strange, it was getting only ESPN.
- Yeah, it's weird.

231
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,862
- Anybody for a game of foosball?
- No, thanks.

232
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:16,240
Come on, you guys!

233
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:19,326
What about you,
maintenance boy?

234
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:23,622
You wanna play? Just one game!
I'm talking one game here.

235
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,625
It's a bad sign when you meet
a girl who wears no make-up.

236
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,503
Unfortunately,
I didn't heed the warnings.

237
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:33,423
Arlene suckered me into
a game of strip foosball.

238
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:37,678
The loser of each goal will have
to remove one article of clothing.

239
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,639
Prepare to get naked.

240
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,327
Beat Matt!

241
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:12,254
I don't know why you girls get such
fiendish delight in defeating men.

242
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:16,341
- We've been emasculated all life.
- You're just trying to distract me.

243
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,429
I'm serious. My mom taught me who
was boss when I was 5 years old.

244
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,640
She started spanking me
with a wooden spoon.

245
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:26,727
We've been forced into
submissive roles all our lives.

246
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:31,064
You might as well be wearing
those little French maid outfits.

247
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:35,402
Your dumb stories will not
throw me off my game.

248
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:39,531
I'm trying to make a point here.
Let me tell you.

249
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,327
I've never felt more manly then the
day my mother broke her spoon...

250
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,913
on my hard buttocks.

251
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:51,043
The tyranny of the spoon was over,
and my ass was liberated.

252
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,253
Until today.
I'm kicking your hole.

253
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,100
My greatest fear
was being realized.

254
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,811
What if one of these girls
was my elevator Aphrodite?

255
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:12,731
What if she saw me
getting beaten by a girl?

256
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:14,733
It's goal time.

257
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:38,674
Score!

258
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,178
Now I wanna see my trophy.

259
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:09,204
Thank God I turned the
thermostat up that day...

260
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:14,084
otherwise my man hood would've
recoiled like a turtlehead...

261
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:18,213
instead of hanging out like
an anaconda waiting for a match.

262
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:34,188
Man, you lost to a girl?

263
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:38,025
Yeah, and my pride shrank
like my scrotum on a snow day.

264
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:41,236
Speaking of scrotum,
I think I can...

265
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,864
add a little weight.

266
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,746
I'm up to 10 pounds, baby.

267
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:59,087
I wonder why God equipped women
with all the weapons for seduction?

268
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:02,716
What do you mean?

269
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:05,260
Take the breasts, for example.

270
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:08,597
You've the bosom...

271
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,517
the aureole... the nipple.

272
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,810
Three concentric circles.

273
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:16,438
in other words,
it's the bull's eye.

274
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:21,693
Its no wonder the breast
is the target for all men.

275
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:26,031
- That's profound.
- And men are grotesque.

276
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,618
I'm not just talking about
the little habits we have...

277
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:32,246
like cleaning our ears
with our car keys.

278
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:35,916
We're grotesque to the core.
Look at the penis.

279
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:39,127
It looks like God had some left-over
skin when he was making elbow...

280
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:44,424
...and he slapped in our groin.
- Man, it freaks me out.

281
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,927
The penis is the first
to shrivel when it's cold...

282
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:49,555
and it's the first
to shrink in fear.

283
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:53,809
The penis is a cowardly flap
of left-over elbow flesh.

284
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:58,814
You wouldn't think that way if you
had a little of my penile power.

285
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:06,488
I screwed up the air-conditioning
in the Virgin Vault again today.

286
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:11,451
This time is too hot, so that girls
will strip down to next to nothing.

287
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:16,248
I should be getting a call
anytime now to fix it.

288
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,172
- Do you have any suspects yet?
- No, there's too many choices.

289
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:25,883
Their dorm is a Whitman
sampler of women!

290
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:29,261
A virtual pot-pourri of pussy.

291
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:34,224
It's more than sex. Those women
have distinct personalities.

292
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:37,394
Look over there.
You see that girl?

293
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:39,646
I call her Ever Tan Barbara.

294
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:42,316
Who's the girl with the
magic markers up there?

295
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:45,986
It's René. She writes
cheat notes on her breasts.

296
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:51,742
See next door? That's Sasha.
She's totally into purple.

297
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:54,870
Have you seen that girl at
the front desk, Rhonda?

298
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:58,665
She can be really cute, but she has
this habit of picking her eyebrows.

299
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:02,002
Yeah, nice from afar,
but far from nice!

300
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:06,673
And you're right. Some girls watch
Jane Austen movies every Friday.

301
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:11,220
The literary world has a term
for those fanatics. "Janeites".

302
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:14,723
My God, let's watch it tonight.
I'll make the popcorn!

303
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:17,476
There's this girl Penny.
Ever seen her?

304
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:20,521
She's always on the phone crying
with her long-distance boyfriend.

305
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:24,024
He wants to break up with her. She
is on the same floor as Maureen...

306
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:28,278
...who has a new hair-style everyday!
- I've seen her around.

307
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,282
Who's that girl with
the green slime, man?

308
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:36,245
You've found Dana.
She's on a all-algae diet.

309
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,957
- And who's the hummer on three?
- That's Michelle.

310
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,876
She sounds like some kind of
Buddhist monk, don't you think?

311
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:46,713
So, have you got any more
suspicious suspects yet?

312
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:49,424
I have that one girl who
never comes out of her room.

313
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:53,428
So I stake out her room.
I just hear a little bit of rustling.

314
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:57,933
I bet you that she's
your mystery woman.

315
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:02,771
- Hurry up, the movie is at 7:30.
- I can't lock the door.

316
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,233
Forget about it. We're gonna miss
the trailer for "North anger Abbey".

317
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,612
Saturday nights were the best
for sneaking into girls' rooms.

318
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:15,450
They went out on dates or home for
the weekend. The dorm was empty.

319
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,497
Except for Dora. She never had
anywhere to go on Saturday night.

320
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:25,002
I did have to admit l've seen cuter
girls in "National Geographic".

321
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,671
She's the kind of girl about
whom Rod would say...

322
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,841
I wouldn't even screw
her with your dick, man.

323
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:33,552
But I felt for her.

324
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:38,432
When you're not good-looking,
you become a failure by default.

325
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,560
People treat you like
you have the Ebola virus.

326
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:45,689
They don't wanna get near, because
what you have might be contagious.

327
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:48,400
It's cruel.

328
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:53,071
This Women Studies class
is gonna be a breeze.

329
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:57,284
We get to check out
all the pretty girls.

330
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:01,496
I think we made
a really big mistake.

331
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:05,375
Today we are gonna study
patriarchal infrastructures...

332
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:08,003
that exercise gender-based
discrimination.

333
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:10,714
Who can give me examples?

334
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:12,966
The pope won't
allow women priests.

335
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:17,888
Why can a man be promiscuous,
but a woman is called a slut?

336
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:21,808
Why is it called "his story",
instead of "her story"?

337
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:24,019
Why women shoes are
always so uncomfortable?

338
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:27,940
An older man can go out with a
young woman, but an older woman...

339
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:30,526
...can't go out with a young man.
- Very good.

340
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:35,030
The boys in the back,
would you care to contribute?

341
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:40,577
You enrolled in my class
to meet girls, didn't you?

342
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:43,497
There's a couple of you
every semester.

343
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:46,124
None of you ever last.

344
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,626
Great

345
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:52,130
I need to maintain at least 3.75
GPA to keep my scholar ship.

346
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:56,593
Now Elsa, of the SS,
is gonna make me lose it.

347
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:59,721
I'll enjoy teaching
you boys a lesson.

348
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:10,023
One Saturday, I got careless.

349
00:28:17,823 --> 00:28:21,994
Disasters truck moments after
I had to drain my main vein.

350
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:36,758
Women have a sixth sense.
They know when something is a miss.

351
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:40,220
They see things that go
undetected to a man's eye.

352
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:49,021
From the slightest detail, she knew
there had been a male presence.

353
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:53,775
And I was such a fool.

354
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:56,945
I had left behind the most
damning piece of evidence.

355
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:30,479
But this girl was a pro. She could
have been trained by my mother

356
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:36,693
My eyes!

357
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:40,030
Matthew?

358
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,451
It's me, Wendy,
from eleventh grade Trig!

359
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,330
We all sat in the back because
Mr. Perialas had such a bad breath.

360
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:58,799
I'm looking for this girl. lf you don't
believe me, check my right pocket.

361
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:01,218
- I have her panties in there.
- I believe you.

362
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:05,430
- So you're gonna check every girl?
- lf I can ever see again!

363
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:10,978
This is so romantic!
Hey, I'll help you!

364
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:13,272
I'm a sucker for matchmaking!

365
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:23,031
I wanna let you know, we're gonna
be doing the lights today, okay?

366
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,006
I just want to let you know that
you're hair looks really cute.

367
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:41,925
And that's all.
0kay, thank you. Bye-bye.

368
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:49,850
With the help of my faithful
companion Wendy, I found a match.

369
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:55,689
I waited impatiently for my mystery
maiden to return. It was hours.

370
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:02,446
Finally my romantic quest was
rewarded. She was a goddess.

371
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:06,283
More than I could ever
possibly have hoped for.

372
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:10,078
I was corrupt with happiness.

373
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:14,082
immediately declared
all the feelings I had had for her.

374
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,710
I think even the word
"love" was used.

375
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,795
I love you.

376
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:22,966
She kept me frozen in suspense,
as awaited for her response.

377
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:32,184
Needless to say, my spirits
crashed like a karmic Kinden berg.

378
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:48,283
Stop soaking, man.

379
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:51,161
Don't you get it?
Women are nothing but trouble!

380
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,038
Great. Here we go again.

381
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:56,625
Hear me out, man. Women
complain that all men want...

382
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:59,962
their girls to look like models,
and it makes them angry...

383
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:04,967
that they have to live up to this
expectation. But what about us?

384
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:09,263
We live with the disappointment
that our women won't look like it.

385
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:11,557
They ever take that
in consideration? No.

386
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:15,519
We've been conditioned to expect
something that we'll never get!

387
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:18,814
And what's worse!
Men age better than women.

388
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:23,986
While we get better over time, we
get with women with saggy tits...

389
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:27,155
who start wearing those bathing
suits that cover the belly-buttons!

390
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:31,118
Then, they get those short asexual
haircuts, and their thunder thighs!

391
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:34,288
Making love to a woman turns
a man into a cellulite surfer!

392
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:36,290
Who gets the better
in the deal?

393
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:40,043
I wonder what prom-night succubus
or second-date siren...

394
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:43,755
had in stilled him
such zealous misogyny.

395
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:49,595
Can you believe? I've gained a half
an inch since I started using this!

396
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:54,099
Where do you start when you
measure your dick, man?

397
00:32:56,476 --> 00:33:01,690
Alright, admit it. l've measured
my dick. Weal have.

398
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:05,652
But the evolved man that I was,
I didn't wanna give Rodman answer.

399
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:10,282
- In your case, from the neck up.
- Screw you, man!

400
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,951
So, hey, what are you reading?

401
00:33:13,202 --> 00:33:15,662
I was just checking to make
sure the paper printed my ad.

402
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:19,124
I've no clue anymore how
to find my black-out knock-out...

403
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:22,461
so every week I take up a personal
ad in the school newspaper...

404
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:25,172
telling my mystery girl that I'll be
waiting every Thursday night...

405
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,674
in the basement
of the Virgin Vault.

406
00:33:27,883 --> 00:33:31,053
So, in complete darkness,
we can renew our relationship...

407
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:33,764
until both of us decide
to reveal our identities.

408
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:36,850
You sit in the dark
every Thursday night?

409
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:41,813
You're a sick man.
You're a freak!

410
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:46,902
- That's it. I'm outta here.
- Alright, man. Take it easy.

411
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,905
And if she's easy,
take her twice.

412
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:53,742
My whole operation was
a romantic bay of pigs.

413
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:56,662
Id already spent several
Thursday nights in the dark...

414
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,081
and she'd yet to show up.

415
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,756
It's me. Wendy.

416
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:14,054
- She didn't come, did she?
- No.

417
00:34:14,263 --> 00:34:17,891
- How did you know I was down here?
- I read your personal ad.

418
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:21,478
It's after midnight.
She's probably not gonna show.

419
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:24,940
But I thought you might want
some dinner. Come for a food.

420
00:34:25,691 --> 00:34:28,026
Wendy was the
über-girl next door.

421
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:30,946
A testament to why women in
our society are cheer-leaders.

422
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:33,949
Everything she did
was perfect.

423
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:38,912
She was arousing in that virginal
MaryAnn, not Ginger sort of way.

424
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:41,415
This kind of girl is scary.

425
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:44,168
She's the kind of girl
you take home to mom.

426
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:49,131
And even scarier, she's the kind
you marry and she becomes your mom.

427
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:50,924
She dresses you, feeds you...

428
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:54,511
leaves notes on toilettes telling you
what chores need to be done.

429
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,265
She's scary because you could
see yourself falling for her.

430
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:01,727
But, at the same time,
you feel that if you fall for her...

431
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:04,605
you're settling for
just the average.

432
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:06,940
What?

433
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:09,359
You're just so perfect.

434
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:12,821
I hate when people say that.
I don't wanna be perfect.

435
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:21,747
So my dad had polio
when he was a kid...

436
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:25,834
and he had this
really bad leg.

437
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:28,086
And whenever he walked...

438
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:31,715
he made this creepy...

439
00:35:31,924 --> 00:35:34,843
thumping noise.

440
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:36,803
And just super creepy.

441
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:40,557
I remember him coming
home from work and...

442
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:44,186
walking down the long hallway
to kiss me good night.

443
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:50,943
I was scared because all I could
hear was the thumping, you know?

444
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:54,154
So I hid under my covers.

445
00:35:54,363 --> 00:35:57,324
is it not sad to be
so afraid of your father?

446
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:02,538
I was really scared of the Wizard
of 0z. That Margaret Hamilton...

447
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:06,834
who does the wicked witch
was so hair-raising, you know?

448
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:10,170
And that music...

449
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:12,965
it scared me so much.

450
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:16,426
I'd get so scared I couldn't sleep,
`cause it'd get stuck in my head.

451
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:19,513
Sometimes, do you know
what I did to calm myself?

452
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:23,725
I remembered that Dorothy killed
the witch by putting water on her.

453
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:28,772
So I'd lie in bed and I'd
work up this big water spit.

454
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:36,196
And I knew that if the witch came
to get me I'd just spit on her...

455
00:36:36,405 --> 00:36:37,990
and she'd melt.

456
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:43,662
I just told you a sad story about my
family, and that's all you can say?

457
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:48,125
I'm sorry.
I'm tragically glib.

458
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:51,336
Men have this anti-intimacy
force field a round them...

459
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:55,090
that is powered by sarcasm,
humor and a version.

460
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:57,551
Why is that?

461
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:01,346
The force is strong
with this one.

462
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:05,684
Maybe it's because a man can fall in
love with a different girl everyday.

463
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:08,937
Maybe it's just nature's way
of protecting a man from himself.

464
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:17,446
How do you feel about
the name "Francesca"?

465
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:21,074
Do you know that Muslim men
shave their pubic hairs?

466
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,203
No wonder so many of them
become terrorists!

467
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:26,997
I can't breathe!

468
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,042
I can't see!

469
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:32,503
Fascinating!

470
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:35,631
Can you blame guys for being
so horny? Look at the dress.

471
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,509
It's one big symbol
for easy access.

472
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:44,765
Have you ever calculated how
many hours' women have wasted...

473
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:46,934
deciding on what
kind of shoes to wear?

474
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:55,108
Foxy lady!

475
00:37:55,776 --> 00:37:59,196
Trust me. They will get drunk,
they do it every Thursday night.

476
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:01,782
And they talk about everything
once they're plastered.

477
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,952
So, as Francesca,
try to make one of them...

478
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:08,121
reveal that she had sex
on an elevator in a black-out.

479
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:16,338
Did I ever tell you about when I got
a bloody nose while giving head?

480
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:23,345
0nce I got my gum stuck in the
guy's pubis while giving a blow job.

481
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:26,598
I've got you all beaten.

482
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:32,187
When I was about to swallow it,
I laughed and it came out my nose.

483
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:36,149
Girls are way
grosser than guys!

484
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,280
A friend had sex in an elevator.
Have any of you ever tried that?

485
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:46,493
I have it. I had a boyfriend who
liked to rub it between my toes.

486
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:50,205
Then he blamed when he got
athlete's foot on his dong!

487
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,342
Francesca's night was
a major bust. That stunk!

488
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:06,972
Well, maybe you just need to try
something different, you know?

489
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:10,893
instead of hoping for hard evidence
on your romantic suspect...

490
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:13,687
maybe you should just
get to know these girls.

491
00:39:13,896 --> 00:39:16,356
You might get a vibe
as to which one she is.

492
00:39:16,565 --> 00:39:19,193
You're right. I do need to do
something I've been avoiding.

493
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:21,904
I need to lower my
anti-intimacy shield.

494
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:26,033
If you had a choice, would
you rather be warm or smart?

495
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,370
So, why is it purple?

496
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:33,290
Isn't "American cheese"
appropriately named?

497
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:35,918
It's fake and processed,
just like America.

498
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:38,378
Tell me something...

499
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:43,550
who's the idiot who invented
the buttoned-down fly?

500
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:48,263
There are dogs who sniff melanoma
in humans before it's diagnosed.

501
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:51,225
Have you ever noticed, they only
give hurricanes wasp names...

502
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:56,104
like hurricane Andrew? You never
hear Giuseppe or Mohammed.

503
00:39:57,147 --> 00:40:00,526
Why older people pull their
pants up over their belly-buttons?

504
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:03,570
Why in golf is it good
to shoot under par...

505
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:06,573
but a sub-par performance
in anything else is bad?

506
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:10,619
Do you know what the best phrase is?
"I'm ready for anything".

507
00:40:14,623 --> 00:40:18,418
I can't speak to Cynthia as Matt.
I start speaking gibberish.

508
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,423
But I have a silver tongue
with her when I am Francesca!

509
00:40:23,674 --> 00:40:27,761
These things are supposed to
get rid of cellulite. Come on.

510
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:31,849
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

511
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,893
How often do you bikini wax?

512
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:38,480
- Everyday.
- I thought I was a fanatic!

513
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:45,279
God, that's Sam! He cannot see me
with these pants and no make-up!

514
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:48,657
Wait, wait a second!
I got your term paper!

515
00:40:48,824 --> 00:40:51,368
I even got one of those plastic
covers! You don't have to...

516
00:40:51,577 --> 00:40:53,537
Hold on a second!
I'll come to you!

517
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:56,415
- Come on!
- I'm coming, Cynthia!

518
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:05,174
- So what's the big deal?
- I'm not stupid. I get things easy.

519
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:08,844
The guys will do anything for me
because of the way I look.

520
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:10,429
I know that.

521
00:41:10,637 --> 00:41:13,056
And if Sam saw me in these...

522
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:16,018
I might lose my edge with him.

523
00:41:16,685 --> 00:41:18,812
Like at "Green Legend",
they lost the power ring.

524
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:22,316
- Who?
- Never mind. You're lucky.

525
00:41:22,524 --> 00:41:23,817
No, I'm not.

526
00:41:24,026 --> 00:41:26,153
It'd be great if guys always
wanted to do things for me.

527
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:29,406
No, it's a curse.
You see...

528
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:33,410
nothing is a challenge for me.
Everything is made easy.

529
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:35,996
And if I ever actually do
something on my own...

530
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:40,667
everyone assumes that I got there
because of my looks. It sucks.

531
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:44,129
So ready to go again?

532
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:53,805
It's just easier to talk to
Cynthia as a girl than as a guy.

533
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:56,683
- There's nothing at stake.
- How do you mean?

534
00:41:56,892 --> 00:42:00,854
When you're a guy talking to a girl like
her, you're going for all the marbles.

535
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:03,690
She's a Super Bowl of women.

536
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:10,280
And you know, if you screw up
and she rejects you...

537
00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:13,200
then every other girl after Cynthia
is gonna seem like a compromise.

538
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:22,000
And you just know you aren't good
enough to get a girl like her.

539
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:30,801
That's why I don't talk
to girls in her league.

540
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:33,387
I just don't wanna know
that I've crashed and burned.

541
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:37,474
I won't ever get the opportunity to
put her ring around my 11th finger.

542
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,276
What are you reading?

543
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:50,863
- Nothing.
- It's gotta be something.

544
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:53,657
Why are you talking to me?

545
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:56,618
I don't know. It's quiet
around here. I'm Matthew.

546
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:59,413
- What's your name?
- Ghost face.

547
00:43:00,163 --> 00:43:01,415
What?

548
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:04,710
- They called me so in high school.
- I'm sorry.

549
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,797
It's okay. I kind of like it.
It's better than being called...

550
00:43:08,964 --> 00:43:12,593
"The Poster Child for Abortion" or
"The Girl with the Vertical Smile".

551
00:43:12,885 --> 00:43:15,137
I was trying to be friendly.

552
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:20,267
Maybe she could tell still
thought she was contagious.

553
00:43:20,475 --> 00:43:23,103
Men wanna be quarantined
from unattractive girls.

554
00:43:23,312 --> 00:43:26,106
We place so much emphasis
on physical beauty...

555
00:43:26,315 --> 00:43:29,943
we're afraid to be infected by
one of these girls' inner beauty.

556
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:34,573
Let's not have a pity party.
Please, you're blocking my light.

557
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,374
Thanks for getting us the
Lifetime channel, Matthew.

558
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:48,837
No problem. Just don't tell
anybody I pirated. It's a felony.

559
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:55,344
Anybody up for a game? How about
you, Matt? 0r are you chicken?

560
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:02,809
Our grudge match escalated
into a cold war of words.

561
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:05,938
Girls are just users. Look at the
praying mantis, for instance.

562
00:44:06,146 --> 00:44:08,524
After they're finished doing the nasty,
the female eats the head...

563
00:44:08,732 --> 00:44:11,318
...of her male mate.
- I should expect a remark like that...

564
00:44:11,527 --> 00:44:14,029
from someone who thinks a car
is an extension of his penis.

565
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:16,698
And a person is an extension
of a woman's vagina?

566
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:18,033
Score!

567
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:24,831
We aren't filthy pigs like men.
We're always picking after you.

568
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:29,044
Why are you so worked up? PMS and
quitting smoking at the same time?

569
00:44:29,253 --> 00:44:34,258
A woman can't get mad, unless it's
her period! You're so close-minded!

570
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:37,845
Yeah, but about
all the right things.

571
00:44:38,512 --> 00:44:40,973
Goal! Two - zip.
Time to strip.

572
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:47,271
America is so one-sided. Wedding
gifts are a demonstration of that.

573
00:44:47,646 --> 00:44:50,691
What all the newly-weds get?
Kitchen stuff. Girlie crap.

574
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:53,527
Small trade-off for having
to cook for some lazy ass man!

575
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:57,698
Lazy? Then answer me this:
When you're walking with a girl...

576
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:01,702
why does the guy have to slow
down, instead of her speeding up?

577
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:05,789
Who said going slower is better?
It's not. Going faster is better.

578
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:08,458
And more exercise.
How about that?

579
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,210
Goal.

580
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,548
At least, we don't start wars.

581
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:18,010
Maybe if we got laid a little bit
more often, we wouldn't be so.

582
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:21,096
Maybe you'd get laid more often, if
you knew what you're doing in bed.

583
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:25,058
You've got it easy. You touch
a guy anywhere and it feels good.

584
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:28,020
With a woman, it's like
finding a needle in a haystack.

585
00:45:28,312 --> 00:45:31,690
While we're on the subject, you
find it gross to go down on a guy...

586
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:34,193
and, when you do it,
it's like a really big deal!

587
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:37,237
But guys are willing to go diving
for oysters anytime, anywhere.

588
00:45:37,738 --> 00:45:40,699
We're more willing to give
pleasure, we're less selfish.

589
00:45:40,908 --> 00:45:44,161
At this remark, I thought Arlene
would spontaneously combust.

590
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:47,998
- You're so sexist!
- You know what? I am.

591
00:45:48,207 --> 00:45:49,750
- So are you.
- I am not!

592
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,295
You sound like Louis Farrakhan
saying only white men are racist.

593
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:58,509
But we all have prejudices.
Black, white, male, female.

594
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:04,515
- Goal.
- You cheated!

595
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:08,644
How can you do that?
I wasn't even looking!

596
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:10,979
My God, you cheated!

597
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:14,775
This was bad. This wasn't
my glorious wrestling fancy.

598
00:46:14,983 --> 00:46:19,446
- You cheated, admit it!
- We didn't lay down any rules!

599
00:46:19,655 --> 00:46:21,240
Maybe that was the problem.

600
00:46:22,783 --> 00:46:26,119
There were no rules
between men and women.

601
00:46:27,371 --> 00:46:31,250
And this lack of rules
made girls...

602
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:34,920
and specially us guys like
these foosball players.

603
00:46:35,254 --> 00:46:39,424
We had giant steels takes for a heart
and we're spinning out of control.

604
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:43,136
I was just as bad as Rod.
But I finally had something to say...

605
00:46:43,345 --> 00:46:46,640
when I was called on in
my Woman Studies class.

606
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:49,351
There's no clear defined rules
between men and women.

607
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,021
Each side thinks they're playing
fair and they're being cheated.

608
00:46:53,355 --> 00:46:58,485
Maybe this is why men and women
bring out the poison in one another.

609
00:46:58,777 --> 00:47:01,947
Rubbish!
We all know there are rules!

610
00:47:02,281 --> 00:47:06,493
Rules that are enforced and imposed
by the contemporary patriarchy...

611
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:09,037
of western civilization!

612
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:16,587
Saturday after midterms seemed
like an ordinary Saturday night.

613
00:47:17,421 --> 00:47:20,883
I checked on the girl who
never came out of her room.

614
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:24,845
Then I noticed that Dora
wasn't in her usual spot.

615
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:26,221
Dora!

616
00:47:53,582 --> 00:47:56,084
Have you girls seen Dora?

617
00:47:58,879 --> 00:48:00,756
Have you guys seen Dora?

618
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:02,799
She's up there.

619
00:48:05,928 --> 00:48:09,139
- Why aren't you doing anything?
- She does this every semester.

620
00:48:09,348 --> 00:48:14,353
Id break the VCRs o those girls
couldn't watch Jane Austen movies.

621
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:16,730
Let's play West.

622
00:48:28,742 --> 00:48:31,537
0ne more flight.

623
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:49,513
Don't do it!

624
00:48:50,806 --> 00:48:53,475
The first time I did this,
nobody noticed.

625
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:56,603
- Now nobody cares.
- I care.

626
00:48:56,979 --> 00:48:58,689
Why are you doing this?

627
00:48:58,897 --> 00:49:03,318
- I was born with the greatest curse.
- What's that?

628
00:49:03,527 --> 00:49:06,780
I'm ugly and I'm
also very smart.

629
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:10,909
- You're not ugly.
- I know what's in store for me.

630
00:49:11,952 --> 00:49:14,496
No one will ever
have passion for me.

631
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:19,751
People all around me will be
falling in love and making love...

632
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,796
and getting married
and having kids.

633
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:25,007
The closest thing
I'll ever have to that...

634
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,968
is someone inviting me
to their Christmas dinner...

635
00:49:28,177 --> 00:49:32,139
because they feel guilty, I might
be spending the holiday alone.

636
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:35,142
0r, if I'm lucky,
my male counterpart...

637
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:40,689
an obese man or a guy with a
harelip, will invite me to coffee...

638
00:49:40,898 --> 00:49:44,359
and we'll pretend to love
each other and tighten up...

639
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:49,990
because we're so desperately
afraid of growing old alone.

640
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:52,659
I had a bad feeling this girl
might jump this time.

641
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,372
I felt terrible that I had treated her
like she had the Ebola virus.

642
00:49:57,581 --> 00:50:01,543
There was something inside this
girl I wanted to expose myself to.

643
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:05,255
She was so self-aware,
so sensitive.

644
00:50:05,506 --> 00:50:07,508
Maybe she noticed
the change in me.

645
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:09,801
Come on,
let's go back inside.

646
00:50:11,136 --> 00:50:13,388
0nly if you admit
that I'm right.

647
00:50:15,557 --> 00:50:18,268
You're probably right.

648
00:50:18,477 --> 00:50:20,896
You didn't have to worry.

649
00:50:21,146 --> 00:50:25,275
I just like to come up here sometimes
and see what it might be like.

650
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,200
I found out what Dora was reading
all those Saturday nights.

651
00:50:33,408 --> 00:50:36,286
D.H. Lawrence, Colette
and Henry Miller.

652
00:50:36,495 --> 00:50:40,290
"Sylvester, yes, he knows
how to build a fire.

653
00:50:40,582 --> 00:50:43,293
But I know how
to inflame your cunt.

654
00:50:44,044 --> 00:50:47,214
I shoot hot bolts
into you, Tania.

655
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:51,009
I make your ovaries
incandescent".

656
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:55,681
Can you imagine someone
being that passionate for you?

657
00:50:57,808 --> 00:50:59,726
Your turn.

658
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:04,940
"Your Sylvester is
a little jealous now.

659
00:51:05,357 --> 00:51:10,070
He feels something, doesn't he?
The reminiscence of my big prick.

660
00:51:10,279 --> 00:51:14,616
I set the shores a little wider.
I ironed out the wrinkles.

661
00:51:14,825 --> 00:51:18,412
After me, you can take
on stallions, bulls, rams...

662
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,955
saint bernards".

663
00:51:22,124 --> 00:51:25,085
Being Francesca has
its disadvantages.

664
00:51:25,294 --> 00:51:26,920
What happened?

665
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:29,840
Last night, my roommate,
Rod, came to find me.

666
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:31,884
He didn't recognize me
as Francesca.

667
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:33,969
God!

668
00:51:40,475 --> 00:51:42,269
Jesus Christ!

669
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:45,147
So he starts looking
at my dress.

670
00:51:45,814 --> 00:51:49,985
I know exactly what he's doing.
Because I do it when I can too.

671
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:55,407
Whenever men look at a girl,
they imagine her naked.

672
00:51:57,993 --> 00:52:00,537
So that's what he's doing
to me right there.

673
00:52:01,246 --> 00:52:03,332
I felt...

674
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:06,376
...violated.
- I know the feeling.

675
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:09,129
It's no wonder that women have
to be the gatekeepers of sex.

676
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:13,800
With the way men are, women
could initiate the sexual battle...

677
00:52:14,009 --> 00:52:15,636
whenever they wanted.

678
00:52:15,844 --> 00:52:19,556
Guys are just simply always
willing to volunteer for sex.

679
00:52:19,848 --> 00:52:22,726
Their attitude towards it, it's like
putting jam into a jelly donut.

680
00:52:23,936 --> 00:52:26,355
I tested the concept with Rod.

681
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,125
So what do you
wanna do about it?

682
00:52:48,377 --> 00:52:51,171
What are you talking about?

683
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:54,299
You just said "I love you".

684
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:58,971
No, you got me wrong.
I said "olive soup".

685
00:52:59,596 --> 00:53:03,684
- What?
- 0live soup.

686
00:53:09,606 --> 00:53:12,526
So he was all ready
to do it with you?

687
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:16,613
It proves men are irresponsible when
it comes to genital gymnastics.

688
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:24,288
I have this theory that
has to do with shopping.

689
00:53:24,496 --> 00:53:27,916
- Shopping?
- Women have more practice at it.

690
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:32,337
They can go into a store, circle
something and they won't buy it!

691
00:53:32,546 --> 00:53:34,381
They're learning self-restraint.

692
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:38,093
Men only go shopping when we
know exactly what we're gonna get.

693
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:40,220
Men and women treat sex
the exact same way.

694
00:53:40,554 --> 00:53:44,099
- Your theory has some validity.
- It's not only sex.

695
00:53:44,308 --> 00:53:47,769
Women are more responsible
about everything!

696
00:53:48,187 --> 00:53:51,106
The fact of the matter is,
women really rule the world.

697
00:53:51,273 --> 00:53:52,608
Thank you.

698
00:53:52,816 --> 00:53:57,404
The irony is that women are not
pointed to recognizable positions.

699
00:53:57,654 --> 00:54:00,073
They have to carry out their
work at the underground.

700
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:03,744
Men are afraid of putting women to
the work place, because they know...

701
00:54:03,952 --> 00:54:06,830
women will rise to their
proper levels on top.

702
00:54:07,372 --> 00:54:11,627
- I think you're right.
- I've got a cookie for you here.

703
00:54:12,294 --> 00:54:14,254
Thank you.

704
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:24,181
Care to come in and share
a bowl of Captain Crunch?

705
00:54:24,765 --> 00:54:29,228
Patty had a way of even making
"Captain Crunch" sound sexy.

706
00:54:29,686 --> 00:54:32,231
No, I have work to do.

707
00:54:32,606 --> 00:54:37,694
Look, don't be afraid. I know you
like some other girl than me.

708
00:54:37,903 --> 00:54:41,448
Here, have some.
It's the original.

709
00:54:43,825 --> 00:54:47,955
There's some syrup to put on it.
That's how I like it.

710
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:50,040
How do you know I like
some other girl?

711
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:55,963
- By the way that you look at me.
- And how is that?

712
00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:00,968
There's a certain way a man
stares at the woman he loves.

713
00:55:01,635 --> 00:55:05,138
The man looks like
a boy on his birthday.

714
00:55:05,347 --> 00:55:08,308
And he treats the woman
as if she were a gift...

715
00:55:08,517 --> 00:55:11,228
that he's waited
so long to open...

716
00:55:11,436 --> 00:55:15,399
and now he can't wait to see
what the treasure is inside.

717
00:55:17,526 --> 00:55:20,320
You don't give me that look.

718
00:55:21,697 --> 00:55:24,700
You know how Captain Hook
could always hear the crocodile...

719
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:27,703
from the tic-tac of his
clock in the crock's belly?

720
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:32,499
That's the way it was for me
with Crick and his nicotine gum.

721
00:55:36,879 --> 00:55:41,216
- I knew I'd find you two together.
- He was all high on nicotine gum.

722
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:43,385
I had to get Patty
out of there.

723
00:55:43,594 --> 00:55:47,681
The best way to do that was to
focus his testosterone on me.

724
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,976
You know something, Crick,
I was wondering.

725
00:55:51,185 --> 00:55:53,353
The bad guys of the world really
know they're being bad...

726
00:55:53,604 --> 00:55:57,649
or they think they're good guys
when they act like sphincters?

727
00:55:57,983 --> 00:56:00,027
I don't know.
You tell me, smart guy.

728
00:56:00,485 --> 00:56:03,530
- So you think you're a good guy?
- I know I am.

729
00:56:03,739 --> 00:56:07,659
You're the one who's trying to
steal my chick. I'm the cool one.

730
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:10,329
Cool? That's another thing
that bothers me.

731
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:12,873
I was just reading that one in
six people think they're cool.

732
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:17,461
What is that like? A billion people
are cool? That just can't be right!

733
00:56:17,669 --> 00:56:20,631
If everybody is cool,
then really nobody is cool.

734
00:56:21,006 --> 00:56:24,009
You don't know what
you're talking about.

735
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:28,472
Look at you. The modern-day media,
the magazines, the TV...

736
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,725
they show us what coolness is,
so that you pony-tale pretenders...

737
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:36,438
can go out there and buy coolness,
thus fooling the weak-minded.

738
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:38,607
I had enough of you, buddy!

739
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:45,489
Get off me!

740
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:49,618
We'd never win this fight with Crick.
lonely had one desperate chance.

741
00:56:52,955 --> 00:56:54,957
Bastard!

742
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:57,709
Get the hell off me!

743
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:05,926
Bastard!
What the fuck!

744
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:12,099
I think we ditched him.

745
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,193
Patty!

746
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:43,797
- What was that?
- My pinball balls.

747
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:49,678
- You had them in while eating?
- Yeah, it's incredible.

748
00:58:05,444 --> 00:58:06,987
There you are!

749
00:58:09,656 --> 00:58:13,702
I was a dead man.
But then fate intervened.

750
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:46,568
After Crick hobbled away in pain,
we were still drunk with laughter.

751
00:58:46,777 --> 00:58:49,154
I guess that's what
made me do it.

752
00:58:49,404 --> 00:58:53,742
Patty came on to me again,
and succumbed.

753
00:58:55,661 --> 00:58:58,872
I tried to rationalize. I thought
maybe I could learn from her...

754
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:01,542
maybe this is why God
made women like this...

755
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:05,587
so that sexually impaired like me
would've someone to practice on.

756
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:09,466
At this moment,
she wasn't a slut.

757
00:59:09,883 --> 00:59:12,719
She was a luscious
voice of experience.

758
00:59:18,225 --> 00:59:20,894
Sweet leaping Jesus!

759
00:59:21,562 --> 00:59:24,940
I figured that nobody on their
deathbed looks back and says:

760
00:59:25,148 --> 00:59:28,026
"l wish I had made love less".

761
00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:30,571
We didn't make love the way
they do it in the movies...

762
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:34,741
where the guy slides in between her
legs like a hot knife through butter.

763
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:37,035
No, this was like real life.

764
00:59:38,203 --> 00:59:41,039
No, not that hole.

765
00:59:41,248 --> 00:59:44,334
I can't get in. You're sure
there's not another ball in there?

766
00:59:44,585 --> 00:59:47,254
No, here.
Let me help you.

767
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:56,221
No, we didn't
make cinema love.

768
00:59:57,139 --> 01:00:00,184
We made the kind of love
where you just laugh together...

769
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:04,855
when bodies make that noise when
air gets trapped in between you.

770
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:09,359
Patty taught me things.

771
01:00:12,738 --> 01:00:14,990
You don't have to kiss me
the whole time.

772
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:18,160
Seems like you're kissing me
just to avoid looking at me.

773
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:22,956
Look into my eyes.
Concentrate on me.

774
01:00:23,165 --> 01:00:25,083
Concentrate on us.

775
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:31,215
Id only done it twice, but now I
knew why men love sex so much.

776
01:00:31,423 --> 01:00:34,551
Because while you're doing it,
you feel like you're as good...

777
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,638
if not better than
every other man.

778
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:43,101
The feeling of that grease makes
you sure you're in the correct path.

779
01:00:43,894 --> 01:00:45,771
Madonna mia!

780
01:00:46,021 --> 01:00:48,899
That everything is right
in the world.

781
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:28,522
Our transcendent fusion was not
the romantic type, it was just fun.

782
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:34,653
My experience with her was not
serious and nothing cosmic.

783
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:42,327
I used her.

784
01:01:42,619 --> 01:01:46,957
- I feel terrible.
- Don't worry about it.

785
01:01:47,165 --> 01:01:49,710
Did I tell you I'm up to
15 pounds over here?

786
01:01:50,085 --> 01:01:52,921
I treated her like she was
my sexual training wheels...

787
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:56,925
something I'd use to learn and I'd
discard when I no longer need them.

788
01:01:57,176 --> 01:02:01,680
And what if the elevator girl finds
out? She's gonna think I'm a dick.

789
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:06,476
Man, it's your manifest
destiny to nail her.

790
01:02:06,727 --> 01:02:11,690
in every species, it's the male
function to perpetuate its line.

791
01:02:11,899 --> 01:02:14,026
Why should it be
any different for you?

792
01:02:14,276 --> 01:02:17,196
You should embrace
your destiny, not deny it.

793
01:02:17,529 --> 01:02:20,115
How are you gonna get by with
this attitude towards women, Rod?

794
01:02:20,324 --> 01:02:24,786
I'm gonna get rich. I'll give me
one of those low-life whores...

795
01:02:24,995 --> 01:02:29,041
give her a nice car, a bunch
of credit cards, lots of cash.

796
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:33,712
in return, she'll take care of the
kids and give me sex on demand.

797
01:02:34,004 --> 01:02:38,008
What's your problem? What happened
to make you hate women so much?

798
01:02:38,217 --> 01:02:42,513
- There's no problem.
- Something had happened. I knew it.

799
01:02:42,846 --> 01:02:45,265
There was definitely
a horror in Rod's past.

800
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:50,062
And it was the encounter with the
monster that Rod called "woman".

801
01:02:50,354 --> 01:02:54,024
- What's your horror story?
- There's no story, man.

802
01:02:54,233 --> 01:02:57,277
You're the one that's got
a problem with women, not me.

803
01:02:57,486 --> 01:03:01,406
Maybe if you tried this thing, you
wouldn't be so nervous all the time.

804
01:03:01,615 --> 01:03:06,703
Not only have my length and girth
increased, but so has my virility, baby.

805
01:03:07,579 --> 01:03:10,958
Just the other day,
I boned this girl all night long.

806
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:13,836
Yeah? What girl?

807
01:03:14,294 --> 01:03:16,421
Francesca.

808
01:03:17,256 --> 01:03:21,260
- Yeah, right!
- Yeah, man. She's doable.

809
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:25,973
- In your dreams!
- She is, man. I'm telling you!

810
01:03:26,306 --> 01:03:31,019
We had sex all night long. She may
be ugly, but I ain't complaining.

811
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,981
I'm shepherd happy.

812
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:36,358
God, I hate guys

813
01:03:40,279 --> 01:03:41,530
Dick!

814
01:03:43,448 --> 01:03:46,535
More than half of the semester had
passed, my debutante of the dark...

815
01:03:46,743 --> 01:03:50,247
my doll of destiny,
hadn't presented herself.

816
01:03:50,455 --> 01:03:53,709
I had almost lost all hope
when something happened.

817
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:58,338
- Matthew?
- You're here!

818
01:03:58,547 --> 01:04:02,801
My God, you know my name!
That's wonderful!

819
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:06,513
- Stop trying to find me.
- What?

820
01:04:06,722 --> 01:04:09,433
I don't want you to find me.

821
01:04:09,641 --> 01:04:13,520
- Can we talk about this for a second?
- There's nothing to talk about.

822
01:04:13,729 --> 01:04:16,106
I don't like you.

823
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:20,319
Wait, can you...
Wait, hey, wait!

824
01:04:24,198 --> 01:04:27,534
I chased her like I was Popeye
Doyle chasing that train.

825
01:04:37,336 --> 01:04:39,254
Got you!

826
01:04:48,514 --> 01:04:50,682
I lost her.

827
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:04,863
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- No, I'm okay.

828
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:08,408
My anti-intimacy force field
was on the autopilot.

829
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:11,453
Come on, might make you
feel better.

830
01:05:11,787 --> 01:05:16,333
I was feeling so bad, I decided to
put the anti-intimacy on manual.

831
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:19,169
- I lowered it.
- Tell me about it.

832
01:05:26,176 --> 01:05:28,220
I figured she had
a boyfriend...

833
01:05:28,428 --> 01:05:32,558
or she was drunk that night
and she didn't remember.

834
01:05:32,808 --> 01:05:36,270
0r I deluded myself into thinking
she thought I was some pre-med...

835
01:05:36,478 --> 01:05:40,649
or pre-law Adonis, and that
wouldn't care when I found her.

836
01:05:40,858 --> 01:05:43,610
I never thought it was
because she didn't like me.

837
01:05:44,236 --> 01:05:48,574
- Maybe there's another reason.
- I don't think so.

838
01:05:48,824 --> 01:05:51,743
I should've figured it had
something to do with me.

839
01:05:51,952 --> 01:05:54,788
Testosterone must really
fill the ego, because...

840
01:05:54,997 --> 01:05:59,918
I've stored plenty of both.
I'm just a big steaming pile of loser.

841
01:06:00,836 --> 01:06:04,798
What do you think I am? It's midnight
and I'm cleaning my room.

842
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:08,635
- Is your mom coming tomorrow?
- Yeah, you guessed it.

843
01:06:10,012 --> 01:06:13,098
How do you get along
with your folks?

844
01:06:13,307 --> 01:06:16,310
in 9th grade, I wanted to read
these James Bond novels.

845
01:06:16,602 --> 01:06:20,439
My mom wouldn't allow it, unless
my father cut out the sex scenes.

846
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:24,818
She said, "That doesn't happen in
real life". And certainly not to me.

847
01:06:25,235 --> 01:06:29,156
I had to get glasses. I begged my
mom to let me get contact lenses.

848
01:06:29,364 --> 01:06:33,285
"lf I get glasses, mom, I couldn't
be handsome like James Bond".

849
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:37,372
She just never let me feel like
I could be sexy.

850
01:06:37,956 --> 01:06:40,542
- I still feel that way.
- God!

851
01:06:42,753 --> 01:06:46,590
Parents always try to turn us into
something we don't wanna be!

852
01:06:46,882 --> 01:06:51,136
I wish I could be more than
my parents' perfect little girl.

853
01:06:57,726 --> 01:06:59,645
That looks like fun.

854
01:06:59,853 --> 01:07:03,190
Wait. 0nly I'm allowed to.

855
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,235
- Now we're even.
- Really?

856
01:08:08,547 --> 01:08:10,507
Hi, mom.

857
01:08:12,009 --> 01:08:13,635
This is Matt.

858
01:08:15,637 --> 01:08:18,432
Finals were nearing, and so was
the end of the school year .

859
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,559
I was running out of time.

860
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:24,521
Look what it did to my
"Pride and Prejudice" tape.

861
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:26,690
This is a catastrophe!

862
01:08:27,232 --> 01:08:30,569
I had one last chance,
one last strategy.

863
01:08:30,777 --> 01:08:36,200
If I improved myself, doing more
than keeping my nails clean...

864
01:08:36,909 --> 01:08:40,370
maybe my cosmetic destiny
might change her opinion of me.

865
01:08:40,579 --> 01:08:42,748
She was out there
somewhere watching me.

866
01:08:42,956 --> 01:08:47,211
I decided, the first step in my
taking a scouring to my soul...

867
01:08:47,419 --> 01:08:50,506
...was peace in the gender war.
- Another point, pussies?

868
01:08:50,714 --> 01:08:54,009
- Forget it. I'm outta here.
- Come on, just one more game!

869
01:08:54,176 --> 01:08:55,886
I'll play.

870
01:08:56,094 --> 01:08:59,014
I was a maze by how well Arlene
and I complemented each other.

871
01:08:59,223 --> 01:09:02,351
Arlene had a soft touch,
knowing just where to set me up.

872
01:09:02,643 --> 01:09:05,270
She let my power game
do its magic.

873
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:09,858
She was an excellent
cheer-leader.

874
01:09:10,025 --> 01:09:12,694
She never got pissed
when I blew a point.

875
01:09:13,028 --> 01:09:15,948
It's okay, you're doing good.
You get it next time.

876
01:09:16,156 --> 01:09:19,451
My balls and her energy drove us
to new performance heights.

877
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:21,787
Come on, Arlene, smoke them!

878
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:30,671
Our masculine and feminine sides
brought up the best in each other.

879
01:09:32,047 --> 01:09:34,174
We went together,
like yinandyang.

880
01:09:34,383 --> 01:09:38,011
Potato chips and soda.
Men and women.

881
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:42,516
Because Crick and his buddy had
the same styles, they often collided.

882
01:09:42,766 --> 01:09:46,395
They were missing something. They
had the power, but no strategy.

883
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:52,150
There was too much ego. They spent
more time fighting each other.

884
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:55,904
You keep your arm
on your side!

885
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:02,953
- That's game, guys.
- End match. Now drop them.

886
01:10:03,203 --> 01:10:05,163
You cheated!

887
01:10:07,249 --> 01:10:11,545
Let's see those trophies, boys.
Let's see them.

888
01:10:11,795 --> 01:10:16,175
Girls, it's just because it's cold
in here. It's freezing, I swear.

889
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:22,055
I know sometimes you think
guys like me can be pigs.

890
01:10:22,264 --> 01:10:26,393
I get sensitive sometimes. Comes
from growing up with 6 brothers.

891
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,729
I know, but I wanna
tell you something.

892
01:10:28,937 --> 01:10:31,815
It's hard for me sometimes to
figure out how to be a man.

893
01:10:32,024 --> 01:10:33,901
What do you mean?

894
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:37,154
I can blame my father a little bit.
My male role model.

895
01:10:37,362 --> 01:10:40,532
My dad loves ice-cream so much,
he'd do anything to get it.

896
01:10:40,741 --> 01:10:43,577
More than once, ld watch him running
out in the middle of the street...

897
01:10:43,785 --> 01:10:46,914
in his underwear,
after the ice-cream truck.

898
01:10:47,122 --> 01:10:50,751
How is that supposed to
teach me to be a man, right?

899
01:10:50,959 --> 01:10:54,546
Back in the day, boys would go
out with their fathers to work...

900
01:10:54,755 --> 01:10:56,965
or they'd take the
weekend and go hunting.

901
01:10:57,174 --> 01:10:59,676
At their fathers' sides,
boys learn to be men.

902
01:10:59,927 --> 01:11:04,348
in the computer age, boys are at
home and fathers, at the offices.

903
01:11:04,556 --> 01:11:06,225
There's no more
apprenticeships left.

904
01:11:06,558 --> 01:11:10,562
It leaves me in the street,
looking at my father...

905
01:11:10,771 --> 01:11:13,148
is his under weareating
ice-cream sandwich.

906
01:11:13,357 --> 01:11:15,484
- Some role model.
- Right!

907
01:11:15,692 --> 01:11:20,239
If I can't grasp what a man is,
how am I gonna understand women?

908
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:24,034
I wouldn't say that. You understand
women better than most men.

909
01:11:24,451 --> 01:11:26,370
Thank you.

910
01:11:29,414 --> 01:11:30,707
I love women.

911
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:34,086
I love those emerald pools
masquerading as eyes.

912
01:11:34,419 --> 01:11:36,964
Lips.
I love smiles...

913
01:11:37,214 --> 01:11:40,259
and the yawns.
The eating.

914
01:11:41,385 --> 01:11:45,389
With skin so soft,
women are head to toe cashmere.

915
01:11:48,267 --> 01:11:53,188
A woman skin inspires a man's fingers
to have Magellan's love of exploration.

916
01:11:57,651 --> 01:12:00,529
It's women's bellies
that drive me wild.

917
01:12:03,907 --> 01:12:09,663
It's more than the only part of
the body you easily see naked.

918
01:12:11,331 --> 01:12:14,793
The belly hints at
the pleasures beyond.

919
01:12:15,878 --> 01:12:20,340
You're so near and yet so far.

920
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:26,388
Everything about a woman
draws you to her sexuality.

921
01:12:31,059 --> 01:12:34,354
The small triangle between her legs
is like the head o fan arrow...

922
01:12:34,521 --> 01:12:36,899
which points, "Go here!"

923
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:41,111
Or if you follow the graceful
line of the pectoral is major...

924
01:12:41,361 --> 01:12:44,740
it inevitably draws your
eyes to the golden orbs...

925
01:12:44,948 --> 01:12:47,326
climaxed by the nipple.

926
01:12:47,659 --> 01:12:53,040
God is in the details. And the
nipple is His greatest detail.

927
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:57,211
Dora loved the video
I made of her.

928
01:12:57,419 --> 01:13:02,549
But I couldn't take the credit.
I said 95% of directing is casting.

929
01:13:03,425 --> 01:13:06,053
See?
You're beautiful.

930
01:13:20,067 --> 01:13:23,320
So, Cynthia, why aren't you out
on a Saturday night?

931
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:28,659
Because my face got flattened like
road kill after the couch fell on me.

932
01:13:29,284 --> 01:13:30,869
Sorry.

933
01:13:31,495 --> 01:13:33,956
It was weird that I felt comfortable
talking to her now...

934
01:13:34,122 --> 01:13:36,542
that her looks
didn't distract me.

935
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,836
She was the same girl, really.

936
01:13:39,044 --> 01:13:41,338
- So what are you reading?
- "World Religion and Us".

937
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:45,676
This guy was supposed to give me
his notes, but he never called me.

938
01:13:46,176 --> 01:13:50,389
I was reading about these religious
scholars who found out that...

939
01:13:50,639 --> 01:13:54,393
the phrase "walking in the water"
meant "walking by the water".

940
01:13:54,726 --> 01:13:59,064
isn't that interesting? Perhaps
Jesus didn't perform any miracle.

941
01:13:59,273 --> 01:14:02,109
We thought he did, because we
made a mistake in the translations.

942
01:14:02,317 --> 01:14:05,445
I hear you. But you know
what's really messed up?

943
01:14:05,654 --> 01:14:07,990
God loves us, right?

944
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:10,742
Then why does he let bad things
happen to good people?

945
01:14:12,035 --> 01:14:14,997
I don't know. I guess God has
a plan for everybody, right?

946
01:14:17,624 --> 01:14:19,793
His plan for me sucks!

947
01:14:27,676 --> 01:14:29,803
You've got strong legs.

948
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:34,516
Id been avoiding Patty for a while.
I didn't know how to handle it.

949
01:14:34,725 --> 01:14:38,353
But I was thinking about her. So
Francesca went to hangout with her.

950
01:14:38,562 --> 01:14:41,607
So what do you think about
that maintenance guy Matt?

951
01:14:41,815 --> 01:14:45,152
- He's not my type really.
- Why is that?

952
01:14:45,319 --> 01:14:49,323
I don't know. He just sort
of seems distracted to me.

953
01:14:49,573 --> 01:14:54,703
It was then that I heard the
cracking of Crick's nicotine gum.

954
01:14:56,288 --> 01:14:59,291
Patty, I just heard of what you've
been doing with Mr. Fix-it.

955
01:14:59,499 --> 01:15:02,377
- Can we talk about this later?
- No, we'll talk about it right now!

956
01:15:02,544 --> 01:15:05,589
- Please, just let go off me!
- Let her go!

957
01:15:05,797 --> 01:15:10,552
You want to some of me too?
It looks like it's just the two of us.

958
01:15:10,886 --> 01:15:13,972
Relax, and we'll
get along just fine.

959
01:15:14,181 --> 01:15:18,602
Are you a slut too? Everything
will be fine. Just relax.

960
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:21,438
Crick was chewing
his nicotine gum in year.

961
01:15:21,647 --> 01:15:25,901
Like kryptonite, it drained any
superpowers I had left in my body.

962
01:15:26,109 --> 01:15:30,322
All that went through my mind was
what Crick had in store for me.

963
01:15:31,448 --> 01:15:34,618
Do you like it?
I'm gonna give it to you good.

964
01:15:36,078 --> 01:15:38,205
Now give us a kiss.

965
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:42,960
I had to do something.

966
01:15:43,168 --> 01:15:46,839
This was not the night that little girl
Francesca was to become a woman.

967
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:59,935
I read later that four thousand women
a year are murdered by their men.

968
01:16:00,519 --> 01:16:03,272
I don't understand women.
But, for a moment...

969
01:16:03,522 --> 01:16:05,566
I had an inkling about their
feelings towards men.

970
01:16:06,525 --> 01:16:10,445
I didn't tell anyone about what
happened. I was too ashamed.

971
01:16:10,654 --> 01:16:12,406
And if that wasn't
bad enough...

972
01:16:12,614 --> 01:16:16,368
I discovered Rod choking the
chicken to the video I made of Dora.

973
01:16:18,036 --> 01:16:20,664
What happened to your dick?

974
01:16:24,751 --> 01:16:29,339
It's called hypospadias.
The hole in your dick is...

975
01:16:29,548 --> 01:16:32,301
it's not on the tip,
it's underneath.

976
01:16:32,593 --> 01:16:36,597
Spooky! It's kind of like having
your mouth below your chin.

977
01:16:36,889 --> 01:16:38,849
Sort of.

978
01:16:39,057 --> 01:16:41,977
Don't tell anyone, alright?

979
01:16:42,186 --> 01:16:45,105
Specially those girls you've
been hanging out with.

980
01:16:45,314 --> 01:16:48,567
I showed it to a girl once,
and she freaked out.

981
01:16:48,775 --> 01:16:53,030
It was then I realized
this was Rod's horror.

982
01:17:00,329 --> 01:17:03,457
I haven't taken it out in front
of a chick ever since.

983
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:08,086
So how do you pee?

984
01:17:09,713 --> 01:17:12,925
I either, you know,
lift it up real high or...

985
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:17,262
if I'm lazy, I just give it
a twist or something.

986
01:17:17,471 --> 01:17:19,681
So this was what
it was all about.

987
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:22,643
The penile power was a way
to prove his manhood.

988
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:26,688
And to build himself up,
Rod had to run down women.

989
01:17:26,855 --> 01:17:29,399
Men are so insecure
about their masculinity.

990
01:17:29,608 --> 01:17:32,152
What pathetic
creatures we are.

991
01:17:32,528 --> 01:17:37,115
- You must think I'm a total faggot.
- No. Not at all.

992
01:17:37,324 --> 01:17:39,743
Did you ever see the James Bond flick
"The Man with the Golden Gun"?

993
01:17:39,952 --> 01:17:43,539
- Yeah, what about it?
- Remember Scaramaga's 3rd nipple?

994
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:46,750
- Yeah, so?
- It was the "superfluous papilla".

995
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,588
And Bond made a fake one so he can
get in the Scaramaga's hide-out.

996
01:17:51,797 --> 01:17:55,717
You're missing the point. The 3rd
nipple was a sign of sexual virility.

997
01:17:56,468 --> 01:17:59,388
So maybe your penis doesn't
make you an elephant man.

998
01:17:59,555 --> 01:18:01,723
Maybe it makes you
a superman.

999
01:18:02,683 --> 01:18:03,892
Cool.

1000
01:18:04,101 --> 01:18:06,854
I had learned something
from Rod's groinular fixation.

1001
01:18:07,354 --> 01:18:11,692
His horror was my horror too.
It was everymen's horror.

1002
01:18:11,984 --> 01:18:15,195
Deny we may, but we're all
afraid of women.

1003
01:18:15,571 --> 01:18:19,283
Every single one of them.
Time had run out.

1004
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:23,954
Finals were in a week. Soon,
everyone would be leaving the dorms.

1005
01:18:24,246 --> 01:18:27,374
The next semester, some would
relocate to off-campus housing.

1006
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:31,003
If I had any hope for finding
my cosmetic destiny...

1007
01:18:31,211 --> 01:18:33,338
I had to face
my greatest fear.

1008
01:18:34,464 --> 01:18:39,595
I went to the Vault and declared
my love in front of 1OOgirls.

1009
01:18:41,305 --> 01:18:42,764
I'm Matt.

1010
01:18:42,973 --> 01:18:46,393
I explained everything done
for my cosmetic destiny.

1011
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,229
My speech must be
my Sistine Chapel...

1012
01:18:49,438 --> 01:18:52,065
my Ninth Symphony,
my "Citizen Kane".

1013
01:18:52,316 --> 01:18:54,860
My words needed to be
more inspirational...

1014
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:57,362
than Martin Luther King's
"l Have a Dream" speech.

1015
01:18:57,571 --> 01:19:00,741
They had to be more miraculous than
Mark McGuire's 7th home run.

1016
01:19:01,033 --> 01:19:06,246
I used impressive words like
"destiny", "soul mate", "yearnings".

1017
01:19:06,455 --> 01:19:10,542
It takes a big man to yearn.
I put my heart out.

1018
01:19:10,751 --> 01:19:16,757
Without you, I'm as lonely as an
abandoned dog in the highway!

1019
01:19:17,007 --> 01:19:21,303
I have gift anxiety. Even though I
don't know when your birthday is!

1020
01:19:21,762 --> 01:19:25,599
We can spend perfect days
shopping and cooking together.

1021
01:19:25,807 --> 01:19:27,809
I'll never make wise cracks...

1022
01:19:28,018 --> 01:19:31,271
when you scrape your tires against
the curb or parallel parking.

1023
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,233
If you concede to live with me,
I'll clean the toilette every week.

1024
01:19:34,441 --> 01:19:36,568
I'll do it with my tongue
if you ask.

1025
01:19:36,777 --> 01:19:40,739
I'll strike the words "hooters" and
"love rockets" from my vocabulary.

1026
01:19:40,989 --> 01:19:45,452
I'll love you even if you are Mimi
and you want me to say "May-May".

1027
01:19:45,661 --> 01:19:51,041
I'll only pass gas underneath the
covers in the direst circumstances.

1028
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:53,418
I'll go on a low-cholesterol diet.

1029
01:19:53,752 --> 01:19:57,172
And I won't buy a red sports car
when I have my mid-life crisis.

1030
01:19:57,422 --> 01:19:59,967
Your parents can come
visit us every week.

1031
01:20:00,175 --> 01:20:02,678
Even if your mom is a
big witch with a capital B.

1032
01:20:02,886 --> 01:20:05,138
Your folks don't have to
go to a retirement home.

1033
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:10,853
They can live with us. I declare, I'll
separate the whites from the colors...

1034
01:20:11,103 --> 01:20:13,981
I'll learn the mysteries of hot
water and cold water washes.

1035
01:20:14,231 --> 01:20:17,067
I'll never huff and puff waiting
for you to put on your make-up.

1036
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:22,656
If you're a cat person, I'll never
say that a dog can save your life.

1037
01:20:23,949 --> 01:20:27,953
I'll happily go see flicks with you,
like "Pride and Prejudice".

1038
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:31,790
I'll make a point to try new foods,
like okra gumbo.

1039
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:34,918
I won't turn my nose at vegetables
whose awful taste...

1040
01:20:35,127 --> 01:20:37,004
is disguised by having
cheese put on it.

1041
01:20:37,421 --> 01:20:42,759
I pledge to always say "yes" when
you ask, "is my hair looking okay?"

1042
01:20:42,968 --> 01:20:45,470
I'm gonna bring a whole new
meaning to the word "cuddle".

1043
01:20:45,804 --> 01:20:48,682
I'll be thoughtful enough to
read you horoscope everyday.

1044
01:20:49,016 --> 01:20:51,810
I'm gonna save every
birthday card you send me.

1045
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:54,438
And I'll actually write you
real letters when we're apart.

1046
01:20:54,771 --> 01:20:57,524
I'm never gonna expect you to
know where I left my car keys...

1047
01:20:57,691 --> 01:21:00,360
and I'll never leave
my socks on the floor.

1048
01:21:00,569 --> 01:21:04,448
With me, you'll find the cap's
always on the toothpaste.

1049
01:21:05,073 --> 01:21:08,285
I'll start wearing those male
bikini underwear if you like.

1050
01:21:08,535 --> 01:21:11,205
My belly-button will
always be free.

1051
01:21:12,581 --> 01:21:14,791
I wanna kiss your clitoris.

1052
01:21:16,043 --> 01:21:20,088
It will be the most passionate,
intimate experience you ever had.

1053
01:21:20,589 --> 01:21:24,176
I declare now,
I'll give my life for you.

1054
01:21:24,426 --> 01:21:26,512
If you fail to come to me...

1055
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:29,765
I know some part of me
will surely die.

1056
01:21:45,447 --> 01:21:47,533
I'm the one, Matt!

1057
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:49,910
No, I'm the one!

1058
01:21:50,827 --> 01:21:53,038
No, I'm the girl
from the elevator!

1059
01:21:53,288 --> 01:21:55,666
Shut up!
I'm the one!

1060
01:21:55,999 --> 01:21:59,253
I'm not the one,
but I'll go out with you!

1061
01:21:59,545 --> 01:22:01,630
My God.

1062
01:22:01,839 --> 01:22:04,550
I could have my choice
of any girl.

1063
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,469
Whoever wanted
could be the mystery girl.

1064
01:22:10,931 --> 01:22:15,060
It' eat me up inside if didn't
find my true cosmetic destiny.

1065
01:22:15,269 --> 01:22:17,938
I would always wonder
who it might have been.

1066
01:22:20,566 --> 01:22:23,735
It was here
I knew it!

1067
01:22:26,822 --> 01:22:31,577
I raced to the door of the girl
who never came out of her room.

1068
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:40,627
There she was.
My once and future love.

1069
01:22:41,879 --> 01:22:44,131
I'm not the girl.

1070
01:22:46,425 --> 01:22:48,385
She's a couple of doors down.

1071
01:22:55,475 --> 01:22:58,020
Patty, I know it's you.

1072
01:23:03,025 --> 01:23:06,028
- Go away.
- Patty...

1073
01:23:06,778 --> 01:23:10,490
You fell in love with
another girl in that elevator.

1074
01:23:10,824 --> 01:23:12,743
I'm not that girl.

1075
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,205
- I fell in love with you.
- No, you didn't.

1076
01:23:16,955 --> 01:23:21,668
I tried to make you love me,
but you were in love with her.

1077
01:23:21,877 --> 01:23:24,463
Why do you think that?

1078
01:23:24,922 --> 01:23:27,674
By the way you look at me.

1079
01:23:32,137 --> 01:23:33,639
Go away.

1080
01:23:34,139 --> 01:23:36,350
is that what you really want?

1081
01:23:37,226 --> 01:23:40,229
Yeah, that's what I want.

1082
01:23:53,408 --> 01:23:59,248
Buck up, man. It looks like you got
weights dangling from your dangler.

1083
01:24:00,207 --> 01:24:02,709
- Smile.
- It wasn't my dangler...

1084
01:24:02,918 --> 01:24:06,463
that had weights on it.
It was my heart.

1085
01:24:18,141 --> 01:24:21,103
Check it out.
The bust got busted.

1086
01:24:21,311 --> 01:24:24,106
It was only my first time.
I swear.

1087
01:24:24,314 --> 01:24:28,819
I told her not to use water-soluble
link. Her cheat note sweat through.

1088
01:24:30,028 --> 01:24:34,616
Cynthia's having a good semester.
She found something she's good at.

1089
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:38,745
Those heavy ant cellulite pants
built up the strength in her legs.

1090
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:41,623
For an actual attacker...

1091
01:24:45,377 --> 01:24:48,297
...you do something like that.
- She can kick some ass!

1092
01:24:49,548 --> 01:24:52,676
The coach says, he's never
seen anything like it.

1093
01:24:52,885 --> 01:24:57,556
And that concludes the martial
arts demonstration for the night.

1094
01:25:02,019 --> 01:25:06,648
The last day of class, I dropped the
bomb on Elsa, she-wolf of the SS.

1095
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:09,985
Ms. Stern, I'm sick of coming into
your class three days a week...

1096
01:25:10,194 --> 01:25:13,363
and hearing my sex is responsible
for all the problems in the world.

1097
01:25:13,739 --> 01:25:15,908
You don't give us any
room for questioning.

1098
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:20,287
Part of the problem is feminist.
There's just too many "ist".

1099
01:25:20,495 --> 01:25:24,875
Feminist, chauvinist, capitalist,
communist, racist, sexist.

1100
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:29,213
They fight one another, instead of
trying to understand one another.

1101
01:25:29,588 --> 01:25:32,299
The only "ist" that
should be are humanists.

1102
01:25:32,508 --> 01:25:36,303
- I agree with Matt!
- I applaud him!

1103
01:25:44,561 --> 01:25:47,314
Elsa couldn't respond.
She just stood there...

1104
01:25:47,523 --> 01:25:49,900
as if she heard the distant
roar of the allied bombers...

1105
01:25:50,108 --> 01:25:52,611
coming to destroy her
propaganda machine.

1106
01:26:04,206 --> 01:26:07,668
Without his tongue, Crick sounded
like he was mentally challenged.

1107
01:26:07,876 --> 01:26:10,212
And although Crick would
never sweet-talk a girl again...

1108
01:26:10,462 --> 01:26:13,257
he still needed to be
accounted for his actions.

1109
01:26:13,465 --> 01:26:17,177
I made the ultimate sacrifice a man
can make to get rid of him forever.

1110
01:26:17,386 --> 01:26:19,304
You're not gonna
bother her again.

1111
01:26:19,513 --> 01:26:22,057
- You go to hell!
- I'm turning you in.

1112
01:26:22,558 --> 01:26:25,644
- What for?
- I fought through the shame.

1113
01:26:25,853 --> 01:26:28,981
I'm going to the police.
You sexually assaulted me.

1114
01:26:33,777 --> 01:26:37,573
- You'll never prove it.
- My bravery inspired others.

1115
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:41,285
- He did it to me too!
- Me too.

1116
01:26:41,535 --> 01:26:45,789
- And me.
- Together, we put Crick away.

1117
01:26:51,253 --> 01:26:53,839
Wendy had a big confession.

1118
01:26:54,423 --> 01:26:57,092
I'm a lesbian.

1119
01:26:57,926 --> 01:27:00,512
Why didn't you tell me?

1120
01:27:01,096 --> 01:27:06,143
I was afraid of what people might
think. Specially my parents.

1121
01:27:06,351 --> 01:27:08,854
Why are you telling me now?

1122
01:27:09,104 --> 01:27:11,899
I think I can deal
with it now.

1123
01:27:12,107 --> 01:27:15,652
That's why I initially helped you
with your search.

1124
01:27:15,903 --> 01:27:20,073
I was hoping that while you
were out finding your girl...

1125
01:27:20,282 --> 01:27:22,534
you might find one for me.

1126
01:27:23,785 --> 01:27:25,746
So I fixed her up
with Arlene...

1127
01:27:25,954 --> 01:27:30,584
who I discovered practiced
an alternative life-style too.

1128
01:27:35,339 --> 01:27:39,510
It was a big week. also found
time to fix Dora and Rod up.

1129
01:27:49,311 --> 01:27:53,941
Their night was electrifying, and
they've been to get her ever since.

1130
01:28:05,452 --> 01:28:07,538
I don't know what it was.

1131
01:28:07,746 --> 01:28:10,916
Maybe it was the romantic
power of candlelight...

1132
01:28:11,124 --> 01:28:14,795
but I decided to
give it one last try.

1133
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:31,687
I've been watching you
And all you do

1134
01:28:31,937 --> 01:28:35,858
For quite some time

1135
01:28:39,903 --> 01:28:44,032
Knowing all the ins
And outs of you

1136
01:28:44,283 --> 01:28:48,662
Is would've known
What was on your mind

1137
01:28:52,457 --> 01:28:57,004
But all the world is
Spinning round and round

1138
01:28:57,212 --> 01:29:00,757
Inside my head tonight

1139
01:29:06,555 --> 01:29:09,141
I remembered what
Patty talked about.

1140
01:29:09,349 --> 01:29:13,312
There's a certain way a man
stares at the woman he loves.

1141
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,231
The man looks like
a boy on his birthday.

1142
01:29:22,237 --> 01:29:26,909
He treats the woman as if she were
a gift he's waited so long to open...

1143
01:29:27,159 --> 01:29:29,870
and now he can't wait to
see what treasure is inside.

1144
01:29:30,078 --> 01:29:35,375
Don't let this end tonight

1145
01:29:36,418 --> 01:29:42,633
Because lm starting to fall

1146
01:29:45,427 --> 01:29:49,097
So let me in

1147
01:29:50,766 --> 01:29:55,312
All that I wanted from you

1148
01:29:56,522 --> 01:30:01,610
Was something you'd never do

1149
01:30:02,277 --> 01:30:07,574
So let me in
Please tonight

1150
01:30:07,741 --> 01:30:13,497
Because lm starting to fall

1151
01:30:13,705 --> 01:30:15,999
They got together.
That's nice.

1152
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:19,837
Sweet leaping Jesus!
