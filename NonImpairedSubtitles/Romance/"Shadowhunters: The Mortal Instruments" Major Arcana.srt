163
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,205
Suit yourself.

164
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:38,721
Camera.

165
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,387
Luke, what is going on?

166
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,030
I think I'm about to be
the prime suspect
in a murder investigation.

167
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,487
[sighs] What do we do?
Get the cards.

168
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:49,685
In my desk, bottom drawer.

169
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,196
All right.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

170
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,528
You can't glamour yourselves.

171
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,033
I'm not the only Downworlder
on the force,

172
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,304
and we don't know
who's working for Valentine.

173
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,473
If anybody spots you--

174
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:58,701
We'd be leading them
right to the Mortal Cup.

175
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,665
Exactly. Better to assume
that everybody has the Sight

176
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,505
than gamble that they don't.
[door lock clicks]

177
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,310
Luke--
I can handle myself.

178
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,949
Hey, what happened
to the camera?

179
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,788
I've asked
the same thing for years.

180
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,062
Slept at Magnus' place?

181
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,433
Didn't do much sleeping.

182
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,931
I was helping
treat Luke's wounds.
That's all.

183
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,004
Really?

184
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,740
What?

185
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,966
[sighs] Nothing.
I believe you.

186
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:41,284
Okay, Magnus made cocktails.
I'm telling you,
nothing else happened.

187
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,411
When you're
ready to talk about

188
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,016
whatever you
need to talk about,

189
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,077
I'm here.

190
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,785
Hey, I talk to you.

191
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,747
About everything
but your personal life.

192
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:49,955
You know, and it's
kind of not fair,

193
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:52,857
because I talk
to you about mine
all the time.

194
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,289
For example,
I broke up with Meliorn.

195
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,855
Really?
Turning over a new leaf?

196
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,904
[scoffs] He was a bit much.

197
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,601
Apparently, I need someone
more Shadowhunter-ish.

198
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,404
Izzy, I realize
that you're trying

199
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,105
to take some of
the family heat,

200
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,137
and I appreciate it,

201
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,812
but you can't
change who you are.

202
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:11,881
Really?

203
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:14,646
And you can?
I know who I am.

204
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,248
I'm a guy who's
about to be disowned

205
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,919
when Dad finds out
that Jace and Clary

206
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,548
are still out
doing God knows what.

207
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,553
I think Dad's
used to that by now.

208
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:23,145
This is Jace
you're talking about.

209
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,386
He said he'd be an hour.
It's been three.

210
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,832
You don't think
he and Clary are...

211
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,698
At a time like this?
Not possible.

212
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,826
[Jace] <i> Really? In here?</i>

213
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,604
[Clary] Why not?
[Jace] There's got
to be a better place.

214
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,673
[Clary] No, here's good.
[Jace] Ow!

215
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,642
[Jace] All right.
[clattering]

216
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,346
[energy pulsating]

217
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,577
You need help with that?

218
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:50,652
[Clary] I can
deglamourize myself, Jace.

219
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,151
[clattering]
[energy pulsating]

220
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,322
It's "deglamour."
[Clary] Whatever.

221
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,716
The cards?
Right.

222
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,989
How exactly are
we gonna get them?

223
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,534
I doubt we can make
it out of this closet
without drawing attention,

224
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,100
let alone Luke's desk
and you are covered in runes.

225
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,600
Don't worry.
I've got a plan.

226
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:11,172
A good plan this time?
90%.

227
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,841
Just follow my lead.

228
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,469
Oh, and I apologize.

229
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:15,974
Apologize for what?

230
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:17,506
The other 10%.

231
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,523
[sighs] You son of a bitch!

232
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,749
Oh!

233
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,187
Stop following me!

234
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,821
[whispering] Hey,
what happened to
being discreet?

235
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,657
Hmm?
Wait, what did you say?

236
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,862
You cheated on me?
I... Huh?

237
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,402
I did not. Whoa.

238
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,930
You will never see me
at your crappy
apartment again.

239
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,497
That girl means nothing
to me. Nothing.
[Clary sighs]

240
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,636
Is that the boyfriend
that I heard so much about?

241
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:49,872
[Clary] Nope, not anymore.
Hi.

242
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,176
I'm dumping him.

243
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,878
Where is all of
Luke's stuff?

244
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,049
IA took everything.
What are you looking for?

245
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,849
I, uh... [stutters]
I lost a house key

246
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,551
and Luke normally keeps
a spare in his desk,

247
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,723
so is there any
way I can get it?

248
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,052
Uh, not till he's cleared.

249
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:06,057
Cleared?
Of... of what?

250
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,729
Oh, don't worry about it.
We'll get it handled.

251
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:09,889
Oh.

252
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,996
[Jace] Clary, I'm sorry.

253
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,098
I apologize.
I just want you to know
it only happened, like...

254
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,701
two or...
It just happened
a couple of times

255
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,572
and I am totally--
[both] Shut up.

256
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,941
Babe, come on.

257
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:21,409
Listen, you don't get
to call her "babe," okay?

258
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,608
In fact, you don't
get to call her at all.

259
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,779
Clary's done with you.
You got it?

260
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,908
Take him out.
[Jace] I have rights.

261
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,008
Perhaps it's for the best?

262
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,245
[sighs]

263
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,250
Oh, matching tattoos.
That's... Big red flag.

264
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,924
Oh. [chuckles] This...
[stutters] It's nothing.

265
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,463
Don't worry about it.
I get it.

266
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,818
You always fall for
the bad boys, right?

267
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,634
Oh, is that just me?

268
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,700
Uh, right, right.
[chuckles] Uh...

269
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:47,926
I really need that key.

270
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,744
I'm sorry, Clary, but IA
has all of Luke's things

271
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,767
in the evidence
vault upstairs.

272
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,113
Oh.

273
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,007
Maybe I can help you
find the one you lost.

274
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,037
Did you check your bag?

275
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,210
Oh, my God!

276
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,884
You're totally right.

277
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:05,183
Thank you so much.
[chuckles]

278
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,546
Bye.

279
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:11,564
I'm going to lunch.
This job is gonna
be the death of me.

280
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,318
French press.

281
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:50,625
And a garlic bagel.

282
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,000
Extra garlic.

283
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,633
Oh, uh... um...

284
00:13:56,636 --> 00:14:00,666
I'm doing research
for a graphic novel
I'm writing about vampires.

285
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,584
I don't think I'm
actually becoming one,
'cause that would be crazy.

286
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:07,014
Where's what's-her-face?
Latte-and-no-whip-cream girl?

287
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,613
Clary, uh...

288
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,583
I don't know.
She's not...
answering my texts.

289
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,286
Can't imagine why.
[chuckles]

290
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:18,894
You all right?

291
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:23,357
Yeah, it's just, uh...
[sighs] Just think
I need some caffeine.

292
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,003
Okay.

293
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,598
You might want to
let that brew...
Never mind.

294
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,151
[exhales] Okay.

295
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,452
[sighs]

296
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,243
Not again.

297
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,514
[bubbling]

298
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,493
[sighs]

299
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:27,363
[sniffs]

300
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,134
Can I do something
for you?

301
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:36,595
I need a list of
everything seized

302
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,043
from Detective
Garroway's desk.

303
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,498
And I need
a slice of pizza.

304
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:44,614
The list. Now.
Full inventory.

305
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,805
Bring it up
with my office.

306
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,380
I'm sorry I couldn't be
more helpful, but, uh, I...

307
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,545
I'm hungry.
[dog barking]

308
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,218
Apparently,
I'm not the only one.

309
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,291
[dog growling]

310
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,762
She must smell a rat.
An IA rat.

311
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,161
[scoffs]

312
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,528
[barking]

313
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,808
You know what?
I'm gonna bring Alec
with me next time.

314
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,007
I don't think he's ever
slapped me in the face.

315
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,638
[sighs] I'm sorry,
I panicked.

316
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,943
Someone call for backup?
Yeah. What took
you guys so long?

317
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,445
Funny, I was gonna ask
you the same thing.

318
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:21,577
It's complicated.

319
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,645
We found the Cup.
The Cup?

320
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,481
Yeah, but then we lost it.

321
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,986
We have to sneak back
in the precinct to get it.

322
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,918
This is a disaster.

323
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:32,323
Hey, demon pox is a disaster.
This is an inconvenience.

324
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,655
We just need a plan.
That's all.

325
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,830
What about a glamour?
We tried that.

326
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,299
Anyone working with Valentine
will see right through it.

327
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:39,958
Can we ask Magnus Bane
to portal us inside?

328
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,066
No.
That'd be awkward.

329
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:43,896
[gasps]

330
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,365
Magnus can only portal us
to places he's been to before.

331
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:48,944
[cell phone ringing]

332
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,676
Not again.
Just give me a second.

333
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,479
Simon, this is
really not a good time.

334
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,651
Clary, where are you?
This is an emergency.

335
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,319
Simon, are you okay?

336
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,178
I'm not sure.
I haven't been
kidnapped yet today.

337
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,586
Simon, seriously,
what's going on?

338
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,093
I think I'm sick.
Like, really sick.

339
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,689
Simon, remember that time
you thought you
had the bird flu?

340
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,185
Okay, just stay
off the Internet
and you'll be fine.

341
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,926
[stutters] Yeah, I know.
But this time it's different.

342
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,102
Hey--
This time I'm really--

343
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:16,831
Oh, my God.
She hung up on me.

344
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,796
Simon's little
problem can wait.
I've got a great plan.

345
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,165
Oh, there's a first.

346
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:23,043
[laughs sarcastically]
Just follow my lead.

347
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,483
Oh, and don't worry,
in my plan,
no one gets slapped.

348
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,178
Thanks, Jerry.
I appreciate it.

349
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,253
We're done for today.

350
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,751
But don't go too far.
You'll be hearing from me.

351
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,253
I wouldn't dream of it.

352
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:40,289
Listen, Garroway, do you
think I'm trying to be
a pain in your ass?

353
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,461
Well, the thought
had occurred to me.

354
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,100
Dude, we've got
your car wrapped
around a street light,

355
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:49,831
drenched in blood,
carrying a GPS

356
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,436
that puts you at
the scene of the crime.

357
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:54,468
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm just not stupid.

358
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,080
[knocks on door]

359
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:15,687
[sniffs]

360
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,852
[groans]

361
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:53,968
Vargas was a good cop.

362
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,134
She was my friend.

363
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,137
One of the few.

364
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:02,409
Your friends
seem to have a habit
of turning up dead.

365
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,238
I can't even imagine
what your
Facebook page looks like.

366
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:06,205
You think I killed her?

367
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,977
[inhales] No.

368
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,746
In fact,
I think I'm your alibi.

369
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,551
Well, I'd appreciate that.

370
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,554
Don't thank me just yet.

371
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,390
I still haven't
figured out your deal.

372
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,660
Even a blind guy can tell
something weird is going on.

373
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,933
You want to do
right by Vargas?

374
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:26,902
Help me out here.

375
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,228
You wouldn't
believe me
if I told you.

376
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,074
Try me.

377
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,835
[Alaric] Fisk.

378
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,242
Think about it.

379
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,545
[Fisk] Yeah.

380
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,320
[Alaric] I checked her wrist.
There's no defensive wounds.

381
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,719
[Fisk] Another demonic murder?

382
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,820
[Alaric]
I don't think so.
Similar MO,

383
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,222
but she wasn't
drained of blood.

384
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,885
The ME have
a time of death?

385
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,233
[Alaric] We're
waiting on forensics,

386
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:57,628
but early guess
is she's been dead
a couple of hours.

387
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,060
[Fisk] A couple hours?

388
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:02,295
No way. I just
talked to the captain
45 minutes ago.

389
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,142
You guys are killing me.

390
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,813
Check the body
for venom.

391
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,981
If it's a demon,
I need to know exactly
what I'm looking for.

392
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:16,051
Okay.

393
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,462
[knock on door]

394
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,333
Simon...

395
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,395
can we have a talk?

396
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,597
"We"?

397
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,302
You, me and your sister.

398
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,185
Do I have a choice?

399
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,970
Well, I've already ducked out
of the office early, so...

400
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:44,836
no.

401
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:46,978
Okay.

402
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,914
[sighs]

403
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,316
I stayed out last
night at Maureen's. I...

404
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,319
I should have called.
[stutters] It slipped my mind.

405
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,186
So, what are you gonna do?
Ground me?

406
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:03,088
Maureen called us
this morning and
she was very upset.

407
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,796
Actually,
Maureen called me...

408
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:09,068
and she said that
you were spazzing out,
like more than normal.

409
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,528
She said...
She did what?

410
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:13,096
Well, I just tried
to say that's kind of
how you are with girls,

411
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,836
but, uh, she was
very upset, so...

412
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:19,777
I told Mom.
You did what?

413
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,953
Simon, Maureen thinks that...
that you might be on drugs.

414
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:26,778
[stammering]

415
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,586
And listen,
if I thought it
was just marijuana

416
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,518
I wouldn't be so worried,
but, honey...

417
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:32,624
you look like you're dying.

418
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,785
[scoffs] Would dying get me
out of this conversation?

419
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,834
I know that I'm not
usually the sentimental
one here, but...

420
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,896
we're here for you.
[Elaine] It's all right.

421
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:44,641
You can tell us,
whatever it is.

422
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,712
Okay, okay, um...

423
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,610
I think I have a disease.

424
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:58,776
[Elaine] A disease?
Like, a bad one.

425
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,645
[gasps] Do you have an STD?

426
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,493
Okay, let's let him
finish talking.

427
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,258
Look, Simon,
it's really not as
bad as you think.

428
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:05,287
These things happen,
all right?

429
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,821
When I was in law school,
I experimented--

430
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,656
We're really off track here.
I think we really
need to focus on Simon.

431
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,162
[Elaine] Rebecca,
it's 2016, all right?

432
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,604
Mom, I'm more than happy--
I had a life.

433
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:14,868
Hey, hey, guys...
[both arguing]

434
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,927
I'm still right here.
[Rebecca] Do not
make this about you.

435
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,366
I'm still right here.

436
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,671
[arguing continues]

437
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:21,936
Excuse me?

438
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,211
[arguing continues]

439
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:24,509
Shut up!

440
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:36,792
Simon?

441
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:45,125
So, I was promised
a great plan.

442
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:47,231
We'll head up
towards the vault.

443
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:49,503
Alec and Izzy are
handling the rest.

444
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:51,172
All we have to do
is wait for their signal...

445
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,800
[sighs]
...and grab the Cup.

446
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,550
He's on our side.

447
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,721
You sure?

448
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,049
Isn't that the line he used
when he kidnapped you?

449
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,115
Good point.

450
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,901
What now? We're supposed
to climb the elevator shaft

451
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,557
and waltz in
the vault unnoticed?

452
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,227
Now, why didn't
I think of that?

453
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:24,566
[laughs]

454
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:27,809
Wait, you're kidding, right?

455
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,638
Remember the binoculars?
Yeah.

456
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:36,052
This one's a Nyx rune.
It's like night vision.

457
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:37,248
You can copy mine.

458
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,020
You got it?
Yeah.

459
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:40,892
Why do I need night vision?

460
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:41,987
You'll see.

461
00:23:44,357 --> 00:23:45,857
[sighs]

462
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,658
[inhales deeply]

463
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:50,488
[winces]

464
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:52,801
Um...

465
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,929
Feel free to ask for help.

466
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:01,166
[flesh searing]

467
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,938
I, um... I think I can
take it from here.

468
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:07,875
Where's the fun in that?

469
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,154
[Alec] Okay, I'm guessing
you're the distraction?

470
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,222
Nope.

471
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,450
I've decided to
grow up, remember?

472
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,116
No more distracting for me.

473
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,288
Besides, I don't think
I'm her type.

474
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:23,825
Oh, crap.

475
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,560
Don't worry,
it's good practice.
Huh?

476
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:28,696
You know,
for asking out Magnus.

477
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:30,865
[chuckles]

478
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:32,971
What are you...
what are you doing?

479
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,242
Unbuttoning your shirt.
What's it look like I'm doing?

480
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:37,241
Izzy, this is not
really my department.
[sighs] Come on.

481
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:38,513
You do this sort of
stuff all the time.

482
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:40,681
You do, I don't.
It's easy.

483
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:44,646
Come on.

484
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,224
Hey.

485
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,259
Can I help you?

486
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:53,017
Yeah, um...

487
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:54,325
[stutters] You
come here often?

488
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,091
I work here.
What can I help you with?

489
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,626
Right, um...

490
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:00,401
Right, right, right,
yeah, um...

491
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,169
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm looking for
some information.

492
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,795
Oh, look...
Oh, wow.

493
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:05,974
I'm so sorry.

494
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:07,202
Let me just get that.

495
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:09,474
That's not... I'm so sorry.

496
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:12,175
That's such a mess.
Let me clean that up.

497
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,508
Uh, it's not working. Okay.
Here, let me.

498
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:15,353
No, I got it.
I got it. Just go. Go.

499
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:16,508
You sure?
Go.

500
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:17,916
Thank you so much.

501
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,432
[sizzling]

502
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,466
[groans]

503
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:44,208
I think you
messed something up.

504
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,010
Really?

505
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:47,342
No, I didn't.

506
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,646
Then why
isn't it working?

507
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:49,878
It is.

508
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,252
[alarm blaring]
That's the signal.

509
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:54,986
Whoa.

510
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,447
Right?

511
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:01,292
Going up.

512
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,730
[alarm continues]
[Luke] What's going on?

513
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:09,172
Some sort of power surge.
Whole building's fried.

514
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:10,898
No lights,
no camera, no nothing.

515
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,073
Get anything
on our killer?

516
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,201
Yeah, you were right.

517
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:15,405
Huge amounts
of demon venom
in Vargas' blood.

518
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,168
It's a shapeshifter.
All right.

519
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:19,176
I'm going after it.
Alert the pack.

520
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:20,778
Anyone sees Vargas,
kill her.

521
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,680
You were trapped in
the precinct all day.

522
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:25,022
If that demon wanted you dead,
it certainly had
the opportunity.

523
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,677
It's not after me.
It's after Clary.

524
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:28,086
Otherwise, I wouldn't be
asking for your help.

525
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,517
You're pack leader now.
You don't need to ask.

526
00:26:30,523 --> 00:26:31,923
Thanks, bud.

527
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:43,134
What is all this crap?

528
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:45,536
Lunch receipts?

529
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:12,197
[Clary exhales]

530
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,300
[softly] You're
getting pretty good
with your stele.

531
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,142
Well, at least we know
he's not a Downworlder.

532
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,397
Lucky for us.

533
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:21,865
Give me a heads up
next time
you're gonna do that.

534
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,179
In here.

535
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:56,013
This will take all day.

536
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,179
[sighs]

537
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,916
Or you could just do that.

538
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:21,534
That looks exactly
like the Mortal Cup.

539
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,974
This is it.
It has to be.

540
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,275
What's wrong?

541
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,454
[stutters]
I'm not sure. I...

542
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:39,223
You're not sure
what's wrong

543
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,448
or you're not sure
where your mom hid the Cup?

544
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:47,458
[sighs]

545
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:55,432
Did you get it?
Theoretically.

546
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:57,234
Theoretically?
Yeah. [sighs]

547
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,736
I found the card.
I just have to figure out

548
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,738
how I reached into
my notebook before.
It's...

549
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,710
It's not an exact science.
Can't you just
pull the Cup out?

550
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,578
I can, theoretically.
I just...

551
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:05,937
It's not as easy
as it looks, Alec.

552
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:07,505
Listen, you two can
discuss theories

553
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:09,083
as much as you want
when we get back
to the Institute.

554
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,911
But right now,
considering we just stole

555
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,176
from the cops,
I suggest we get home.

556
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,754
Guys...
[necklace pulsing]

557
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:16,593
I think the mundanes
might be
the least of our worries.

558
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:17,789
Well, at least we know
the demon necklace works.

559
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,990
Never a dull day. Let's go.

560
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,664
Guys, slow down.

561
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:29,973
[gasps] Oh, I am so sorry.

562
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:31,936
[roars]

563
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,443
[growling]

564
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,541
Grandma.

565
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:38,983
[grunts]
[demon screeches]

566
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,649
What the hell?

567
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:45,082
Language.
Not in front of Grandma.

568
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:46,984
How did it find us?

569
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:49,994
[Jace] I don't know...

570
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:52,559
but she brought friends.
How can you tell?

571
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:53,958
It's like seeing
through a glamour.

572
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,289
You just got to
pay attention
to the details.

573
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,555
But I can't see anything.

574
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:58,633
Behind us.

575
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,073
I... I still can't see them.

576
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:08,269
Okay, there's
too many people.

577
00:30:08,274 --> 00:30:10,814
I don't say this often,
but I agree with Clary.

578
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,680
We gotta get out of here.
Hey, this way!

579
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:24,023
[panting] What's
the Unlock rune again?

580
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,062
Open sesame.

581
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:30,889
[Jace] Go.

582
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:39,867
Hey, what are you doing?

583
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,442
Holding them off.
Take Clary back
to the Institute.

584
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,541
No, if you're staying,
I'm staying.
We fight together.

585
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:47,613
Don't be stupid.
If the demons get the Cup,
we're dead anyways.

586
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:50,113
I'm not leaving
anyone behind.
You don't have a choice.

587
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,715
I know you guys are
having a moment, okay?
But we really have to go.

588
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:54,688
[Isabelle] Don't worry.
It's not like this
is the first time

589
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:56,717
Alec has saved your life.
[sighs]

590
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:58,062
I doubt it'd be the last.

591
00:30:58,057 --> 00:30:59,417
Go.

592
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,534
[dialing]

593
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:12,196
[line ringing]

594
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,344
[Clary] <i> Hello.</i>
Clary?

595
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:15,539
I need you--
<i>You've reached Clary's phone.</i>

596
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,341
<i> I'm not here,</i>
<i> but you know the deal.</i>

597
00:31:17,343 --> 00:31:19,013
<i> Leave one at the beep.</i>
[line beeps]

598
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:20,481
Um, Clary...

599
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,279
[shuddering] I
need to talk to you.

600
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:24,505
I think I need to
talk to you more

601
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:26,616
than I've ever needed
to talk to you in my life.

602
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,853
I know... [inhales deeply]

603
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:32,115
I know you're busy
saving your mom, but...

604
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,633
I think I'm
becoming a vampire.

605
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:39,157
[phone beeps]

606
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:41,474
Darling, you don't
know the half of it.

607
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,443
Blood is stronger than will.

608
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,568
[shuddering] Shut up.

609
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:51,584
Stronger than desire.

610
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,537
Shut up! [grunts]

611
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:56,305
[Camille echoing]
<i> Even stronger than love.</i>

612
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,294
[breathing heavily]

613
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:11,629
[gasps]

614
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:16,473
[shuddering]

615
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:17,868
Come to me.

616
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,511
What you really want is--
[yells]

617
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:25,179
[gasping]

618
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,147
[sobbing]

619
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:45,299
[panting] Hold on.

620
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:48,797
I'm sorry, Jace.
It's okay.
We can take a breather.

621
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,531
[Clary] No, it's not that.
I, um...

622
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,074
I'll scout ahead.

623
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:58,078
I'm sorry for
all the trouble
I've put you through.

624
00:32:58,077 --> 00:32:59,637
You don't have to
apologize to me, Clary.

625
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,235
Unfortunately,
you can't stop me.

626
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:03,476
[chuckles] Well, yeah,
I'm starting to see that.

627
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:07,153
Just... I've been so focused
on trying to find my mom,

628
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,852
I don't think I
realized how much
you've actually done for me.

629
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,886
So, thank you.

630
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,121
Clary, I'm a Shadowhunter.

631
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:16,126
It's kinda my job.

632
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:17,488
