1
00:00:56,236 --> 00:00:58,727
You have very beautiful toes.

2
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:01,231
Did I ever tell you that?
Yes, you have.

3
00:01:01,308 --> 00:01:04,471
I'm not even...
I'm not even a foot guy.

4
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:07,104
They're not even webbed. Are
you concentrating on the game,

5
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:10,775
or are you just lusting after
the feet of your soon-to-be wife?

6
00:01:11,084 --> 00:01:12,551
I'm concentrating.

7
00:01:15,956 --> 00:01:18,322
Carl, it's Neil.
Are you there?

8
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:19,949
No, we're not.

9
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:23,325
Carl. It's Neil.
There's a problem.

10
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,857
There's
a wedding-related problem.

11
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:27,796
All right, go. Get it.

12
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:30,296
Hey.

13
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:33,498
I hear you whispering
about not answering me.

14
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:36,801
Just remember,
when this is all over

15
00:01:37,844 --> 00:01:39,744
it's just you and me.

16
00:01:43,016 --> 00:01:46,076
Carl, if you're humping,
stop, 'cause I'm coming in.

17
00:01:46,686 --> 00:01:48,449
Dude, it's Dupree.

18
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,455
How the hell did Dupree
end up on the wrong island?

19
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,694
Dupree was born
on the wrong island.

20
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,931
Gentlemen, move this out of the
way, please! We're coming through.

21
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,135
Thank you very much.
Right this way, please.

22
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,302
Careful with the boxes.

23
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:12,868
Ten minutes ago
those were supposed to be out.

24
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:14,844
Where's Mr. Thompson?

25
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:27,518
Dad, this is incredible.

26
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:29,290
We really didn't
need all this.

27
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:31,421
I know. But I did.

28
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:40,772
Dupree!

29
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:43,969
There he is.

30
00:02:44,044 --> 00:02:46,342
Did other people land
on the wrong island?

31
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:49,041
Guys, I know I'm in the
doghouse, but come on.

32
00:02:49,149 --> 00:02:52,949
These islands, Maui, Cowee,
Lenowi, very easy to get mixed up.

33
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:54,384
Don't worry, you're here.
Don't worry.

34
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:56,251
I got my head turned around. I'm sorry.

35
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:59,351
Come here, you big lug.
All right.

36
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:02,927
Thank you.

37
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:05,862
Folks, this is
a bittersweet time for me.

38
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:09,868
A day that Molly's mother, rest
her soul, and I used to dream about.

39
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:13,167
On one hand, I'm inheriting
a new son-in-law,

40
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:16,665
but on the other,

41
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:19,077
Daddy's losing
his only little girl.

42
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:23,705
Now, when Molly told me
that she was gonna marry Carl,

43
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:26,375
I said, "Who?"

44
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,847
And Molly said,
"Daddy, he works for you."

45
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:32,016
I said, "Honey, I've got
1, 200 employees nationwide."

46
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:33,889
But then I started to worry.

47
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,293
Maybe he was some young buck
trying to push me aside,

48
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:39,662
grab the reins of my company.

49
00:03:42,302 --> 00:03:46,068
And then I met Carl,
sitting in cubicle 26.

50
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,006
And I said,
"You know, I like my chances."

51
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,513
So, ladies and gentlemen,
will you raise your glass

52
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:57,641
to Molly and Carl, to health
and happiness. He's funny.

53
00:03:57,751 --> 00:03:58,877
Cheers.

54
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:00,044
Hear! Hear!

55
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:11,529
One! Two! Three! Carl!

56
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:16,925
Hey, everybody,
listen up.

57
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:18,903
Now, wait.
Just wait.

58
00:04:19,272 --> 00:04:22,764
In honor of your
impending nuptials,

59
00:04:22,842 --> 00:04:27,609
I want to perform a feat that I've
used to mark every special occasion

60
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:29,911
in our lives since
at least high school.

61
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:32,577
Ladies and gentlemen,
birds and bees,

62
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:36,179
I present to you
the Flaming Tornado!

63
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:43,188
Honey, look who's here!
Hi!

64
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:46,021
This is just
a safety precaution.

65
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:49,630
Okay. Little room here.
Need to focus.

66
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:53,201
Barkeep, your finest Kentucky
bourbon, low-grade tequila...

67
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:54,763
I've got a mai tai.

68
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:58,470
Don't let him start till I get
back...lemon slices, a funnel,

69
00:04:58,545 --> 00:04:59,876
and an open flame.

70
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,379
Yeah!

71
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:05,580
Okay. Funnel.

72
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:08,718
Tornado! Tornado!

73
00:05:08,822 --> 00:05:11,052
Open flames.
Carl will have the honor.

74
00:05:11,124 --> 00:05:14,025
Will the groom
please light the liquid?

75
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:17,325
Carl, grab this. Carl,
you got... Where...

76
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,494
What are you doing?
Do the Tornado.

77
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:26,130
Maybe later.
No!

78
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:27,833
No.
What are you doing, man?

79
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:29,534
No, we'll do it later.

80
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:30,769
Do it now!

81
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:32,606
Carl has to be here.
Now!

82
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:34,942
Let Carl come and do it.
Dude.

83
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:37,815
I'm doing the Tornado, bitch!

84
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:40,045
Do that Tornado!

85
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:44,886
Neil! Neil! Neil!

86
00:05:50,563 --> 00:05:51,587
Oh, my God!

87
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:01,070
Yo, Tornado Man.

88
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,537
This one is for you,
my brother.

89
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:05,942
Nice one.

90
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:12,042
Well, I guess this is where
the road ends for you and me.

91
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:14,211
We had a good run,
though, didn't we?

92
00:06:14,287 --> 00:06:17,779
Hey, Dupree, I'm not dying.
I'm just getting married.

93
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:21,583
Yeah, I know. Hey, listen.

94
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:26,189
I feel bad about, you know, earlier
when I was laughing like a hyena

95
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,427
when Mr. Thompson was making
all those jokes at your expense.

96
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:30,799
Well, they weren't really at my
expense. No, no, no, they were.

97
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,929
It was a shot across
your bow. Yeah? You think?

98
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:34,940
It wasn't that funny.
I mean, it was,

99
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:37,772
but I shouldn't have been
laughing, 'cause I'm your best man,

100
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:40,438
and I don't want this guy
getting in your head, okay?

101
00:06:40,513 --> 00:06:41,946
'Cause he's in my head
a little bit.

102
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:44,381
It just... It's... I don't
know. I don't want you to forget

103
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:46,783
that you're bringing something
to the table, too, okay?

104
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:49,788
You've got that...
That Carlness.

105
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:51,448
That little
twinkle in your eye.

106
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:52,752
And you're giving it
to me right now.

107
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:55,294
That little glint that says
they're never gonna beat you.

108
00:06:55,361 --> 00:06:57,693
They can't lay
a glove on you.

109
00:06:58,031 --> 00:07:00,693
And don't forget that, because
you can't put a price tag on it.

110
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:01,791
End of sermon.

111
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:04,268
Well, thanks, buddy,
I appreciate it.

112
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:07,637
But, you know, I really think
he was kidding around.

113
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:10,608
Yeah. Guy's got a kind
of a weird sense of humor.

114
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:14,374
Besides, it's not like I'm gonna be
working for him for the rest of my life.

115
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:16,881
You know,
I got plans of my own.

116
00:07:18,118 --> 00:07:20,678
There it is.
There's that Carlness.

117
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:23,180
They can't lay a glove on you, can they?

118
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:26,156
God, I admire you.
I really do.

119
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:28,121
That's no secret.

120
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,325
Thanks, buddy. Thanks.

121
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:38,031
Oh, I wanted to give you this.

122
00:07:38,738 --> 00:07:41,832
You know,
for being my best man.

123
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,604
You got to be shitting me.
It's a flask!

124
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:50,205
You like it?
I love this.

125
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:52,911
Good. Hey, you know, that reminds
me of the groomsmen outfits.

126
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:54,146
I really like them,
but I'm wondering,

127
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,586
should mine be a little
different since I'm the best man?

128
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:57,917
What did you have in mind?

129
00:07:57,991 --> 00:07:59,720
Just like a little
insignia or a patch.

130
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:01,192
I don't want
people to be confused.

131
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:02,558
I'm talking
something understated,

132
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:04,096
like a lightning bolt.
Nothing big.

133
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:06,028
Lightning bolt?
Something.

134
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:10,431
Could be cool.
Yeah. I like it.

135
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:16,170
Although, it is going to be listed in
the program that you're the best man.

136
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:18,271
Really?
Uh-huh.

137
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:21,004
That's pretty good. Okay.

138
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,605
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That should be enough.

139
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,554
Now, is Neil gonna be
okay over there?

140
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:32,785
I'm seeing him, and it looks
like the tide's coming up.

141
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,360
Neil's gonna be fine.

142
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:51,709
Bingo!

143
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:29,574
Oh, wow! How many thank-you notes
do you think we have to write?

144
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:31,913
Well, I counted 111.

145
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:34,515
Honey, I'm gonna do
half of them.

146
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:37,980
Oh, come on. Really?
No, no, no. Really.

147
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:41,687
Dear whoever gave us
this platter, I love it!

148
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:45,423
Finally a platter. Just what I always
wanted ever since I was a little boy.

149
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:48,797
And now you've made
my platter dreams come true.

150
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:52,804
That's perfect. And then you
write 55 more just like that,

151
00:09:52,872 --> 00:09:54,635
and you're done.
Yeah.

152
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:57,967
MOLL Y.. Hi, this is Carl.

153
00:09:58,478 --> 00:10:00,446
And this is Molly.
Molly.

154
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:03,141
We can't get to the phone right
now. You've reached the Petersons.

155
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:05,343
So, if you leave a
message... Wait for the beep.

156
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:07,180
...we'll get back to you as
soon as we can. All right...

157
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:09,414
Have a beautiful day.

158
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,324
All right, let's do it again.
No. That was really cute.

159
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:15,884
I called you Carl. It was really
funny. Molly, it was cheesy.

160
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:18,055
No, it wasn't cheesy.

161
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:19,995
Give it to me.
It's totally cheesy.

162
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:22,091
Give me the machine.
No! It's good cheesy!

163
00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:23,931
Give me the machine.
No!

164
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,467
ID? Hey, married guy, how you doing?

165
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:30,668
Good morning, Reese.

166
00:10:30,743 --> 00:10:33,007
ID?
Top of the morning, Paco.

167
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:51,419
So, we're back
from the honeymoon.

168
00:10:51,497 --> 00:10:52,930
Oh, yeah, we...

169
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:55,194
We had a great time, sir.
It was just...

170
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:57,634
It was really wonderful.

171
00:10:57,704 --> 00:11:00,901
So I took a look at your
proposal while you were gone.

172
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:05,034
The Oaks at Mesa Vista.
You like it?

173
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:07,443
Did I like it?
I loved it!

174
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:09,645
It's perfect for lot 208.

175
00:11:11,617 --> 00:11:13,881
208? It's huge.

176
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:18,553
If I may, Mr. Thompson, it...

177
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:25,094
Mesa Vista is really more of a
smaller, 40-unit eco-community.

178
00:11:25,164 --> 00:11:28,292
Not anymore, Carl. You got to
think big, you got to think bold.

179
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:31,269
You're a married man now.
You're married to my little girl.

180
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:34,067
I'm fast-tracking this
project. And you, sir,

181
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,971
you're the lead designer
on it.

182
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:37,906
Excuse me, sir?
That's right.

183
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:40,104
You are the lead designer.

184
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:45,149
Wow, that's... Wow,
that's... That's great.

185
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:48,184
What happened to Harrison?

186
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:49,915
I had to let him go
while you were gone.

187
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:51,786
I had a little problem
with Rancho del Mar.

188
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:55,453
But, Carl,
I believe in you.

189
00:11:56,195 --> 00:12:00,859
You've got it.
It's here and it's here.

190
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:06,327
Release it.
Okay. I'll do that, sir.

191
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:14,545
Release it.

192
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:24,178
Wow! I can't believe it.
He made you lead designer.

193
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,952
Yeah. Apparently,
he just loved my proposal.

194
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:29,927
And it's a little bit bigger
than I initially planned,

195
00:12:29,996 --> 00:12:31,691
but you know, hey,
maybe that's a good thing.

196
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:32,890
So, what does this mean?

197
00:12:32,965 --> 00:12:35,058
Well, it means
I've got my own office.

198
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:37,636
Which is really great.
Oh, and it's got a view.

199
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:41,605
A view of trees and some cars.
It's just terrific, and...

200
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:43,767
Living the dream, honey.
Living the dream.

201
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:46,334
MOLL Y.. Wow.
Maybe we can celebrate

202
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:49,347
a little when you get
home tonight from guys' night.

203
00:12:49,415 --> 00:12:50,939
Are you trying to seduce me?

204
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:53,918
CARL.. All
right, I'll see you tonight.

205
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:02,025
What's up, guys?
Carl, you made it!

206
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:06,524
Intense matches going on.
Guys' night, man!

207
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:10,468
Hey, there he is!
Guys' night!

208
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:13,403
Can you feel the fun
for the guys' night?

209
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:14,770
I can just feel it,
you know?

210
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:17,241
Shit balls!

211
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:19,267
What's that?

212
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:22,840
It's my alarm. My hour's up.
That's it for me.

213
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:24,280
What, are you kidding me?
Bullshit.

214
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,612
Where are you going?

215
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:27,452
I've got to go
meet my wife

216
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,082
and watch Sisterhood of
the Traveling Ya-Ya Pants.

217
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:34,956
I don't... How late do you get to
stay out? I used to have midnight.

218
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:37,359
Do you get midnight?
'Cause I was late once, and...

219
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,558
I'm a grown man, Neil.
I don't have a curfew.

220
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:42,366
Not yet you don't.

221
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:46,064
But in all seriousness, you
got to tell me something, okay?

222
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:49,699
Do I smell like beer?
Yeah.

223
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:52,403
Good. Because you know what
I don't smell like, then?

224
00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:56,209
Cigarettes and weed.
That one's free.

225
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:58,243
Yeah!

226
00:13:59,752 --> 00:14:03,518
The dream continues!
Still undefeated!

227
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:05,113
Yes! Nice.

228
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,991
Will you look at this guy?
Look at you.

229
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,584
Is this what it looks like
to be married?

230
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:11,562
Come here, man.
It's still early on.

231
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:13,758
To fidelity, commitment,
the whole shebang.

232
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,631
Yeah, and I also
got a promotion today.

233
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:21,295
Add it to the list. Forever
blessed as the dream continues.

234
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:24,274
How are you doing, buddy?
How am I doing?

235
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:26,004
Good question.

236
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:28,774
Turns out I got fired for taking
that week off to go to the wedding.

237
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:30,839
Wait a minute.
You got fired?

238
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,611
Apparently,
I never had authorization.

239
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:35,017
My boss claims
he never received my e-mail.

240
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:37,112
Then I had a little bit
of a cash flow situation,

241
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,750
so I ended up
losing my apartment.

242
00:14:40,092 --> 00:14:42,322
You're not living
out of your car?

243
00:14:42,428 --> 00:14:44,453
Carl, I'm not an animal.

244
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:48,961
Plus, it was a company car.
So when I lost the job...

245
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:50,764
It's okay.
I picked up a ten-speed.

246
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:52,929
Dave's letting me crash
at the bar after hours.

247
00:14:53,005 --> 00:14:56,270
Dupree, you can't sleep in a
bar. We're not in our 20s anymore.

248
00:14:56,342 --> 00:14:58,105
Sure you can. I got
a cot set up in the back.

249
00:14:58,177 --> 00:14:59,371
This is ridiculous.

250
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:01,639
Look, you're gonna come home
and you're going to stay with us.

251
00:15:01,714 --> 00:15:04,114
That's sweet of you to say,
but I can't impose, and I won't.

252
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:06,481
Dupree will land
on his feet as always.

253
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:08,986
Can I have a toast, please?
Thank you.

254
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,523
Listen, Dupree, we've
got to get rid of the cot.

255
00:15:11,624 --> 00:15:14,491
Some of the regulars
are starting to complain.

256
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,690
They don't think it's fair that you
get to sleep here and they don't.

257
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:21,228
Curley said that, didn't he?

258
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:24,233
Curley? Curley!
What?

259
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:26,362
What? You got a problem
with me sleeping on the cot?

260
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:29,134
We all have a problem
with you sleeping on the cot.

261
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,699
We took a vote.
The ayes have it.

262
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,577
Dupree? Live with us?
Not live.

263
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:38,814
Just stay for a couple of days

264
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:40,249
until he gets back
on his feet.

265
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:42,082
Molly, he's been
sleeping in a bar.

266
00:15:42,188 --> 00:15:44,748
How does that happen?
Who knows? It's Dupree.

267
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:47,657
I mean, I told you. His mother moved
to Florida with that yoga idiot,

268
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:50,093
and all of his friends are
married, including myself.

269
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:53,256
He's got nowhere to go.
He's like an orphan.

270
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,690
Wait a second.

271
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,167
What's all this?

272
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:01,638
This is that celebration
we were supposed to have

273
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:04,335
about your promotion.
Oh, that's right.

274
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:06,369
I'm sorry, hon.

275
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:09,276
Look, Molly,
let me go outside

276
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:10,781
and tell Dupree
to bring his bags in...

277
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,341
What? Dupree's here?

278
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:15,720
Carl! Carl.

279
00:16:16,622 --> 00:16:17,782
Carl.

280
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,718
Okay, look, you're right.

281
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:25,694
I screwed up. I did this
all wrong, and I'm sorry.

282
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,794
I should have called first.

283
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:34,038
You know what? Maybe I should just
give him some money for a motel.

284
00:16:34,106 --> 00:16:36,199
Carl. Carl.

285
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:41,574
He's your best friend.
He's here.

286
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:43,612
He can stay.
That's great, Molly.

287
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:46,150
Look, it's only gonna
be for a couple days.

288
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:48,220
Well, a week at the most.
Okay.

289
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:50,221
After that,
he's out of here.

290
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:53,885
Keep those candles burning.
I'll be right back.

291
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:55,119
Okay.

292
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:03,399
Hey, Molly.

293
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:06,438
I want you to know I really,
really appreciate this, okay?

294
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:09,269
Yeah. No. It's really no
problem, Dupree. Thanks.

295
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:11,003
Nice moose.
Oh, yeah.

296
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:13,409
Murphy,
say hello to the missus.

297
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:14,810
Hi, Murphy.

298
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,542
Come on in, buddy. Make
yourself at home. Great.

299
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:19,413
I hope the couch
is okay 'cause

300
00:17:19,485 --> 00:17:21,749
we're working on everything
upstairs. Oh, yeah. I'm fine anyplace.

301
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:23,686
And you know where
everything is. Thank you.

302
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:25,479
Great.
Thanks.

303
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:28,618
Thank you. And, hey, listen,
just to put your minds at ease,

304
00:17:28,694 --> 00:17:30,787
this is not a permanent
situation. Okay?

305
00:17:30,863 --> 00:17:34,162
I'm hitting the job trail,
I'm gonna hit it hard tomorrow.

306
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:36,667
Wheels of change
are in motion.

307
00:17:36,736 --> 00:17:38,829
Good. Good.
That's a good attitude.

308
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:42,396
Despite what my ex-boss said,
I'm not unhirable.

309
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:44,807
Those copiers didn't exactly
sell themselves.

310
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:46,742
And frankly, I think
we had an inferior product,

311
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:48,871
and I'd tell people that
if they asked.

312
00:17:48,981 --> 00:17:51,313
I wasn't going to lie
for that son of...

313
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:53,511
I don't want to get
started on him, but...

314
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:56,419
Okay, great.
Well, make yourself at home,

315
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:58,581
and Molly and I are...

316
00:17:58,691 --> 00:18:01,421
Well, we're going to go upstairs
and take care of some stuff.

317
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:05,361
Well, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Listen, we're all adults here.

318
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:07,524
You're newlyweds. Making
love's a big part of that.

319
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,160
You're supposed to explore
each other. I get it.

320
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:11,396
Come on.

321
00:18:11,504 --> 00:18:12,732
If this situation's
gonna work,

322
00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:14,466
we've got to be honest
with each other.

323
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,839
Now, go on. Enjoy yourselves.
I'm not gonna listen.

324
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:19,867
Hump away. Go on, get
out of here. Good night.

325
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:21,105
Okay.

326
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:25,248
Good night.

327
00:18:43,035 --> 00:18:45,595
I'm kind of dreading
the talk with his parents.

328
00:18:45,704 --> 00:18:49,470
He hasn't really been treating
anybody very nicely at...

329
00:18:56,982 --> 00:19:00,076
That's not good.
No. Not for us

330
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,310
or our couch.

331
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:33,012
Computer skills. Not really.

332
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,441
The Oaks at Mesa Vista.

333
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:05,477
This is exciting, isn't it?

334
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:08,813
Stunning. Just stunning.

335
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:12,623
You know, sir, if we're
not gonna have any trees,

336
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:14,750
maybe we should consider
changing the name.

337
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:17,625
No. No, no,
I love the name.

338
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,927
Names are important, Carl.

339
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:24,134
Are you gonna
answer that phone?

340
00:20:24,203 --> 00:20:25,898
Give me a second.

341
00:20:27,006 --> 00:20:28,769
What do you want?
DUPREE.. Carl, hey.

342
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:30,775
Real quick, where
do you keep the plungers?

343
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:32,674
A plunger? What do you need
a plunger for?

344
00:20:32,745 --> 00:20:36,408
No reason. Just want
to stay on top of stuff.

345
00:20:36,482 --> 00:20:38,074
What do you mean "no reason"?
What happened?

346
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,142
No reason. I just want to know where
things are in case there's an emergency,

347
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,482
which there probably
never will be.

348
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:44,716
I don't have time for this.
I'm...

349
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:47,483
I don't have time for this.
I'm at work. I got to go.

350
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,993
You better
make some time for it

351
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:50,358
'cause we got
a little bit of a situation.

352
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:52,795
I didn't want to have to
say anything, but...

353
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:54,860
Carl?

354
00:20:57,236 --> 00:20:58,726
Just stopped.

355
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:00,164
Where were we?

356
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:04,039
We were talking about names,
Carl. How important they are.

357
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:08,343
Would you ever consider letting
Molly keep her last name?

358
00:21:09,014 --> 00:21:12,506
I mean, I know it's a strange
request coming from a father-in-law,

359
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:16,544
but a man's name
is his legacy,

360
00:21:16,622 --> 00:21:18,749
and if Molly takes yours,

361
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:22,122
then the Thompson name
dies with me.

362
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:25,620
Well, there's lots of
Thompsons around, aren't there?

363
00:21:25,731 --> 00:21:29,098
Not in a direct line, Carl.
No, no, not in a direct line.

364
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:32,529
Well, what about our kids?

365
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:38,709
Children should have the last name
of the father, don't you think?

366
00:21:38,777 --> 00:21:40,904
You're having kids?

367
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,472
Well, not right now,
but eventually.

368
00:21:48,153 --> 00:21:50,678
You know, in certain
Asian cultures, Carl,

369
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:52,986
the husband
takes the wife's name.

370
00:21:53,092 --> 00:21:55,720
Wait a minute. You just said
a man's legacy is his name.

371
00:21:55,794 --> 00:21:57,625
All right.
What about a hyphen?

372
00:21:58,063 --> 00:21:59,724
A hyphen?
Yeah.

373
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:02,824
I could ask Molly,
but I don't think she...

374
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:06,469
Wait a minute. You mean me.

375
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:08,570
You mean
I'm supposed to hyphenate.

376
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:12,372
Well, then you can still use your own name,
only you'll be hyphenating it. It's win-win.

377
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:14,776
With all due respect,
not for me it isn't, sir.

378
00:22:14,847 --> 00:22:17,782
All right, forget it. You're
obviously upset about it.

379
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,785
You know what, I'm sorry
I even brought it up.

380
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,816
Let's keep focused
on your project.

381
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:38,297
Come on! Come on! Toshi, what are
you doing? You gave him a meatball!

382
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,462
Watch the car!

383
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:43,000
Throw it, throw it.
We got him.

384
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:45,202
Throw it, throw it!

385
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:48,474
Did he touch the plate? He...
Oh, here we go.

386
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:51,311
The game just turned. Yes!

387
00:22:51,383 --> 00:22:54,147
Carl Peterson,
third team honorable mention.

388
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:57,450
All-district, 1984.
We get Carl.

389
00:22:57,523 --> 00:22:59,115
No, we get him.
Hey, what's going on?

390
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:01,091
There he is.
Hey, sweet heat.

391
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,752
Time to dust off
the old jockstrap.

392
00:23:02,828 --> 00:23:05,456
This kid Dougie's been
killing us all afternoon.

393
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:07,328
We need your arm out there.
Let's go.

394
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:11,335
Dupree, I'd love to, but I
can't. I kind of had a rough day.

395
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:14,094
And I better go in
and see Molly.

396
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:19,075
I like it.
Family first. Priorities.

397
00:23:20,045 --> 00:23:22,343
Okay, he can't play. We're
gonna have to do it ourselves.

398
00:23:22,414 --> 00:23:25,645
Now listen, I want you to brush him
back here, okay? What's a brushback?

399
00:23:25,718 --> 00:23:27,879
It's where you throw it really
close to him. Scare him a little bit,

400
00:23:27,953 --> 00:23:29,443
but don't hit him 'cause
he's bigger than you.

401
00:23:29,555 --> 00:23:31,420
But, Mr. Dupree,
I don't even play baseball.

402
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,514
I'm in the orchestra,
remember?

403
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:34,684
First of all, call me Dupree
'cause I'm your team-mate.

404
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,921
Second of all, so what
if you're in the orchestra.

405
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:38,394
So was Catfish Hunter.

406
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:41,365
Let's go. Let's go. Here we go!
Here we go! Hey, batter, batter...

407
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:43,401
Hi! How was work?

408
00:23:44,069 --> 00:23:45,536
It was fine.

409
00:23:46,205 --> 00:23:48,696
Good fine? Bad fine?
Fine, fine.

410
00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:53,302
You wouldn't believe the response
I'm getting for my Career Day program.

411
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:55,710
And I saved a spot for you on
the 15th if you're interested.

412
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:57,214
Yeah, of course.

413
00:23:57,282 --> 00:24:01,048
I'll bring in some blueprints
and maybe even some models.

414
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,178
It'll be fun.
TOSHl: No. Get away.

415
00:24:02,254 --> 00:24:04,745
You hit me! You hit me on purpose!
The kids'll really love it.

416
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:06,085
No more fighting.
Thank you, that's it!

417
00:24:06,158 --> 00:24:08,718
Hey! Hey! Come on now!
Break it up. That's it!

418
00:24:09,995 --> 00:24:11,792
DUPREE.. Hola,
you've reached Dupree.

419
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:13,388
If this is in regards
to employment,

420
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:16,798
please be aware that my Class
Four driver's license has expired,

421
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:20,099
and I am no longer willing to
work with asbestos. I won't do it.

422
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:22,106
Can you believe that?
A little chin music

423
00:24:22,174 --> 00:24:24,074
and the whole neighborhood
goes crazy.

424
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:26,509
It was like... Oh, and for
Carl and Molly, press two.

425
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:29,172
Oh, I meant
to tell you about that.

426
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:32,114
I changed the answering machine
in case somebody calls about a job.

427
00:24:32,184 --> 00:24:34,277
I'm staying on top
of this job thing.

428
00:24:35,687 --> 00:24:37,951
You guys are okay with that,
right?

429
00:24:38,023 --> 00:24:40,082
We got to put the job first.

430
00:24:41,527 --> 00:24:44,325
Well, Carl,
are we okay with that?

431
00:24:45,464 --> 00:24:47,989
Molly. Molly, come on.

432
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:51,800
Nice.

433
00:24:52,171 --> 00:24:54,935
MAN ON TV..
HBO. Simply the best.

434
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:57,942
When did we get HBO?
Yeah, you saw that.

435
00:24:58,177 --> 00:25:01,044
I upgraded us, and I'm
going to go halfsies on it

436
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:03,137
'cause I love it also.

437
00:25:03,782 --> 00:25:05,545
You get it upstairs,
too.

438
00:25:05,984 --> 00:25:07,884
I think you get
the Oxygen channel, too.

439
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:13,122
What? What are you doing?
What?

440
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:15,319
What do you want? Cinemax?

441
00:25:16,795 --> 00:25:19,525
What do you hear?
What do you say?

442
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:24,460
So, let me get this straight. I mean,
he hijacks our answering machine.

443
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:27,027
"Carl and Molly, press two."
Okay?

444
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:28,800
And then he decides, "Hey,
I'm sleeping on the couch,

445
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:30,364
"and I'm gonna order HBO."

446
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:33,569
I mean, I don't know, Carl.
Am I wrong here?

447
00:25:35,414 --> 00:25:36,506
Carl!

448
00:25:36,582 --> 00:25:39,847
Molly, what do you want
me to do, whack the guy?

449
00:25:41,587 --> 00:25:45,387
Look, I told Dupree not to
change anything without asking,

450
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,549
and I gave him
a pair of pajamas.

451
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:49,320
Dupree's gonna
get the hang of this.

452
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:53,558
He's never truly been domesticated.
He's like the ape-man of Borneo.

453
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:56,759
Oh, so we're the lucky ones
who get to housebreak him?

454
00:25:56,869 --> 00:25:59,269
No, you know what I mean,
honey.

455
00:25:59,738 --> 00:26:01,205
I'm over it.

456
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:04,569
I finished
my thank-you notes today.

457
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:08,445
Do you need help with
your half? No, no, no, I...

458
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:14,584
Candlesticks, bread maker,
Crock-Pot. I got them covered.

459
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:16,611
It's my final offer.

460
00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:18,713
No, I got them covered.

461
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:25,888
Sorry to interrupt. Oh!

462
00:26:25,964 --> 00:26:28,296
Damn it, Dupree! What is
this? This is an emergency.

463
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:30,835
I'm sorry. The downstairs
crapper, it's on the fritz again.

464
00:26:30,903 --> 00:26:32,097
What do you mean,
"It's on the fritz"?

465
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,604
I don't know.
It's on the fritz.

466
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:38,003
Please tell me he's joking.

467
00:26:38,377 --> 00:26:40,538
We might need some matches.

468
00:26:42,581 --> 00:26:44,742
Does that
answer your question?

469
00:26:47,052 --> 00:26:49,020
Oh, God!

470
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:52,947
Dupree! Oh, my God. I don't...

471
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,219
Carl! Carl!

472
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,758
Dupree! Dupree?

473
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,392
Yo!

474
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:05,925
Dupree, what you did in our
bathroom last night was disgusting.

475
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:07,631
Molly nearly passed out.

476
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:08,933
I know, I know.

477
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:11,475
Believe me. I'm never
eating Buffalo wings again.

478
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:14,010
I don't care how much
I love them. I'm off them.

479
00:27:14,112 --> 00:27:17,673
It's weird. I used to have a stomach
like a billy goat, but not anymore.

480
00:27:17,783 --> 00:27:20,411
Now, I made a little breakfast
for... Molly, great.

481
00:27:20,485 --> 00:27:21,747
Come here.
Morning.

482
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,185
Good morning.

483
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:25,916
Right here. Let me get
this chair for you here.

484
00:27:25,991 --> 00:27:29,449
Have a seat. Breakfast is served. Yes.

485
00:27:29,528 --> 00:27:32,122
I believe Carl told me
you're a fan of

486
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:35,291
the banana pancake
and the soy macchiato.

487
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:36,959
One second.

488
00:27:37,469 --> 00:27:38,834
I want
this to be perfect.

489
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:41,030
Did you tell him all this?

490
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:42,996
Here you go.

491
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:44,835
Soy macchiato.

492
00:27:44,943 --> 00:27:48,106
Dupree, you really didn't have to do
all this. Yes, I did have to do this.

493
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,273
Look, I know I got off
on the wrong foot,

494
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:54,285
and I just want you both to know
that I really appreciate this.

495
00:27:54,353 --> 00:27:56,480
And I'm grateful.

496
00:27:56,822 --> 00:27:58,881
I don't know what to say,
but... Don't say anything.

497
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:01,755
Just accept my apology
and enjoy this feast.

498
00:28:01,827 --> 00:28:04,261
I'm off to a very promising
job interview

499
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:07,457
which explains my natty
attire. Wish me luck. Goodbye.

500
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:10,262
Good luck. Go get them,
tiger! I will. Thank you.

501
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:13,060
Off like a prom dress.

502
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,909
So, why don't you
describe yourself, Mr. Dupree.

503
00:28:17,976 --> 00:28:21,002
I'm a people person.
Very personable.

504
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:23,809
I absolutely insist
on enjoying life.

505
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:28,909
Not so task-oriented.
I'm not a workhorse.

506
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:32,821
If you're looking for a Clydesdale,
I'm probably not your man.

507
00:28:32,891 --> 00:28:34,825
Like, I don't live to work.

508
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:36,690
It's more the other way
around. I work to live.

509
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:40,323
Incidentally, what's
your policy on Columbus Day?

510
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,334
Yeah, we work.
Really?

511
00:28:43,402 --> 00:28:45,563
The guy discovered
the New World.

512
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:49,197
I'm afraid to even ask
about Victory over Japan Day.

513
00:28:52,577 --> 00:28:55,512
LADY OVER SPEAKER.. Eddie. You
have a call waiting on line...

514
00:28:56,681 --> 00:28:58,615
Hey, we tried. Right?

515
00:29:00,585 --> 00:29:02,712
Thanks a lot. Yeah.

516
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:07,087
I'm gonna keep my résumé.
Excuse me.

517
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:12,522
You've got to lean into it
and commit to it.

518
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:14,895
That's the way.
You get hurt if you're afraid.

519
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:17,457
And if you time it
just right, then you both...

520
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:20,595
There he goes. Come down. You
guys got to get a rhythm going.

521
00:29:20,672 --> 00:29:21,969
Come on.

522
00:29:22,941 --> 00:29:25,409
Here, watch me. See, I'm just
running down the ramp.

523
00:29:25,477 --> 00:29:27,172
It's actually harder
than on a skateboard.

524
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,146
There we go.
Speed's your friend. Hold on.

525
00:29:30,248 --> 00:29:32,113
Yeah, come down. Go.

526
00:29:32,184 --> 00:29:34,516
You see how he's timing it?
And then he pops it up? Go!

527
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:36,849
Yes! Go! One more time.

528
00:29:36,955 --> 00:29:38,320
So,
what's going on over here?

529
00:29:38,423 --> 00:29:41,824
Carl, check out this badass skate
ramp I had Aaron's dad build for us.

530
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:45,328
Hey, man, I was just telling these guys
how we used to tear it up back in the day.

531
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,523
Yep! Pretty good.

532
00:29:47,632 --> 00:29:48,724
Hey, I got an idea.

533
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,768
What do you say we put on
a little show for these guys?

534
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:54,169
Throw down some one-wheelers.
Make it rain out here.

535
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:55,500
Come on. For a second.

536
00:29:55,607 --> 00:29:56,733
Yeah,
let's see what you got.

537
00:29:56,808 --> 00:29:58,275
Yeah,
show us something.

538
00:29:58,343 --> 00:30:00,641
Okay, give me a board.
Yes! Carl!

539
00:30:00,712 --> 00:30:02,304
Step aside, guys.

540
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,007
Honey, I need some help.

541
00:30:04,116 --> 00:30:06,880
Yep,
just like back in the day.

542
00:30:07,552 --> 00:30:08,814
Nice!

543
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:10,320
Let's show them
how we used to do it.

544
00:30:10,388 --> 00:30:12,379
Step aside.
Step aside.

545
00:30:15,727 --> 00:30:19,219
Well, no one ever said
we were gonna live forever.

546
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:21,126
Let's go.

547
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:23,531
Carl! Carl,
what are you doing?

548
00:30:23,635 --> 00:30:26,433
What's it look like he's doing?
He's getting ready to rip it up.

549
00:30:26,505 --> 00:30:29,838
Relax, Molly. This is
only gonna take a second.

550
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:32,375
Come on, Dupree!
Say when.

551
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:36,206
When!
Yeah!

552
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:44,481
Oh, I'm racked!

553
00:30:44,556 --> 00:30:45,750
Carl!

554
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:48,757
Oh, I racked
my little Duprees.

555
00:30:50,395 --> 00:30:52,693
When was the last time
you were even on a skateboard?

556
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:54,823
1987.
Oh.

557
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:58,768
For a second there
we almost had it back.

558
00:30:59,204 --> 00:31:00,364
Yeah.

559
00:31:05,877 --> 00:31:07,367
What is this?

560
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,876
Are you kidding me?

561
00:31:10,615 --> 00:31:12,412
Are you kidding me?

562
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:15,116
Is this some kind of a joke?

563
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,950
Carl,
Thompson wanted more units.

564
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:21,086
Thought it would work better
as a wraparound.

565
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:22,592
Wraparound.

566
00:31:22,794 --> 00:31:25,627
Mesa Vista
is not a wraparound.

567
00:31:26,898 --> 00:31:29,696
Hasta mañana, Paco.
Good night, boss.

568
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:34,700
Look, Mr. Thompson. Hey.
You see the preliminaries?

569
00:31:34,773 --> 00:31:38,607
Yeah, I did, and it's completely
different than my original proposal.

570
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,736
God damn it, Carl.
Will you stop fighting this?

571
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:44,976
People buy homes. Let the
government pay for the parks.

572
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:47,210
That's why we have taxes.

573
00:31:52,657 --> 00:31:57,117
The Oaks at Mesa Vista
is a money train.

574
00:31:58,897 --> 00:32:00,762
You wanna be on it?

575
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:10,264
Yeah, I'm on it.

576
00:32:19,684 --> 00:32:22,619
Money train.
I'll give you a money train.

577
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,457
Right there! Right there!
You gotta throw it now!

578
00:32:33,531 --> 00:32:34,623
Please, please, please!

579
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:36,291
No, he didn't go over!
No! No! Why?

580
00:32:36,368 --> 00:32:39,826
He didn't make it, man.
Carl! Welcome home!

581
00:32:39,938 --> 00:32:41,963
Come here, buddy!
We got one for you.

582
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,769
Get a beer for him.
What are you guys doing?

583
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:45,969
We're watching the game.
Yeah, I can see that.

584
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:48,672
Hey, guys! Please, shut
the hell up for two seconds

585
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,645
'cause it's fourth and
inches. Please, just shut up.

586
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:52,080
You shut up!
It's fourth and inches!

587
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,310
Why don't you watch it
in your house?

588
00:32:53,385 --> 00:32:55,580
I can't have friends over on
weeknights and you know that.

589
00:32:55,654 --> 00:32:57,246
Grow a sac.
It's not my problem, Neil.

590
00:32:57,322 --> 00:32:59,222
Take it up with Annie.

591
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:03,822
Time for the lion tamer. Yeah,
well, I can't talk to him like this.

592
00:33:04,829 --> 00:33:06,797
What's going on?
You all right?

593
00:33:06,865 --> 00:33:09,095
Yeah. I'm fine.

594
00:33:09,901 --> 00:33:11,960
God, I've been
watching you lately, man,

595
00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:15,871
and you're really putting in the
hours, but you got to find some balance.

596
00:33:15,974 --> 00:33:19,239
Find a little Carl time. You
know what I'm saying? Carl time.

597
00:33:19,344 --> 00:33:21,972
MAN ON TV.. First down,
Cougars. Now Washington State...

598
00:33:22,047 --> 00:33:23,537
You're right.

599
00:33:23,648 --> 00:33:25,548
Carl time.
Come here.

600
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,914
Molly's got the Back
to School thing tonight.

601
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:31,648
We got the house to ourselves
for a while. Let's watch the game.

602
00:33:31,723 --> 00:33:33,486
Let your hair down. Let
your hair down. I mean...

603
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:35,150
You think I've been overdoing
it with the work thing?

604
00:33:35,226 --> 00:33:37,421
I know you've been
overdoing it.

605
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:41,727
Yeah. Shake it loose, huh? Just live
a little, man. Just live a little.

606
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:45,860
Yeah. You know, maybe I
ought to make my nachos.

607
00:33:45,937 --> 00:33:47,837
Nice!
Yes!

608
00:33:47,906 --> 00:33:50,841
Carl time! Nachos, Carl
nachos are in my belly.

609
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:53,377
Hey, Neil, turn up the
volume. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

610
00:33:53,445 --> 00:33:55,436
You know who else loves
Carl's nachos is Eddie.

611
00:33:55,547 --> 00:33:57,208
Give him a call.
I already did.

612
00:33:57,282 --> 00:33:59,842
Carl, soup them up, man!
Make them spicy!

613
00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:04,355
Okay, guys.
This is it. This is it.

614
00:34:04,422 --> 00:34:07,050
Come on. Just come on.
Please. Please, God!

615
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:08,956
Send everybody!
Send everybody!

616
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,460
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Damn!

617
00:34:11,563 --> 00:34:13,861
No, no.
No, no.

618
00:34:13,932 --> 00:34:14,956
No!

619
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:18,365
No, no!
No! No!

620
00:34:18,803 --> 00:34:20,794
No!
Yes!

621
00:34:20,872 --> 00:34:23,773
What did I tell you?
That's what I'm saying!

622
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:27,903
Congratulations, idiots.
Congratulations, guys. Very good.

623
00:34:27,979 --> 00:34:29,412
Fifty pushups, faggot.
Fifty pushups.

624
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:30,914
I'm not giving you
any pushups.

625
00:34:30,982 --> 00:34:33,416
That was the deal.
Fine. Okay? Enjoy it.

626
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:35,817
One, two...
He has a condition.

627
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,889
...three, four. That's
right! I have a condition.

628
00:34:38,957 --> 00:34:40,151
I should not keep doing this.
Come on!

629
00:34:40,258 --> 00:34:41,919
I have a gamey colon, and
it gets spastic and spasms.

630
00:34:41,993 --> 00:34:43,290
You don't have a condition.

631
00:34:43,395 --> 00:34:45,795
Carl. Carl! Neil, shut up!
Carl. I didn't read that.

632
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:48,161
Mark, what? What is it, Mark?

633
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:49,927
Molly.

634
00:34:53,805 --> 00:34:54,931
Hi.

635
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,137
Oh, hey, Molly.

636
00:34:58,676 --> 00:35:00,109
You're home early.
Really?

637
00:35:00,178 --> 00:35:03,011
I just invited
some of the guys over

638
00:35:03,848 --> 00:35:05,645
to watch a little football.

639
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:10,119
Figured it was just a little time
to loosen up. A little Carl time.

640
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:14,087
Me gusta margarita!

641
00:35:17,462 --> 00:35:18,952
Hola, Dupree.

642
00:35:19,464 --> 00:35:20,897
Hola, Molly.

643
00:35:21,966 --> 00:35:23,627
Charlie.
Brilliant.

644
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:26,997
Sorry.
We should go.

645
00:35:27,071 --> 00:35:28,800
You guys want to go?
Yeah, let's get out of here.

646
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:30,397
That's a good idea.
Let's go to Larry's.

647
00:35:30,508 --> 00:35:32,066
Let's get out of here.
Let it go. Let it go.

648
00:35:32,177 --> 00:35:33,701
What'd I do with my tie? Let's go.

649
00:35:33,812 --> 00:35:36,406
Bye.
Sorry, I ashed on your floor.

650
00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:38,539
Great.
Take that tie off your head.

651
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,642
I'll bring this back tomorrow.
I'll give it to Carl at the office.

652
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,710
So, don't tell Annie I was
here. And if you do, don't...

653
00:35:43,822 --> 00:35:45,756
Just don't tell her that I asked
you not to... Get out, Neil.

654
00:35:45,824 --> 00:35:47,792
Out!
Okay. I'll just go.

655
00:35:50,695 --> 00:35:52,925
I know what you're thinking,
Molly.

656
00:35:53,031 --> 00:35:56,228
But we were gonna have this
rug shampooed. I promise you.

657
00:35:56,334 --> 00:35:58,825
Oh, and look. Look at that.

658
00:35:59,537 --> 00:36:02,199
It's my grandmother's
silver cheese platter.

659
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:04,671
You used it to serve nachos.

660
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:07,567
Well,
nachos have cheese in them.

661
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:17,117
Let me just start cleaning up
some of... Dupree, please stop.

662
00:36:21,392 --> 00:36:23,622
Somebody arriving late for the
party. Don't worry about it.

663
00:36:23,728 --> 00:36:25,719
The party... Game's over!

664
00:36:25,797 --> 00:36:27,890
Go away! The party's over!

665
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:32,127
Party... Molly,
for the love of God! Please!

666
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:37,307
We heard there were
some bad boys in here.

667
00:36:39,777 --> 00:36:41,938
There were, but they left.

668
00:37:16,014 --> 00:37:17,845
You know, Carl, I...

669
00:37:18,249 --> 00:37:20,740
I really think I've been pretty
cool about this whole situation,

670
00:37:20,818 --> 00:37:23,309
and I hate having
this conversation with you.

671
00:37:23,421 --> 00:37:26,254
But this is not exactly how
I pictured us getting started.

672
00:37:26,324 --> 00:37:27,621
I know.

673
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:29,918
Look, Dupree's got to go.

674
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:32,792
No. It's not about
kicking Dupree out.

675
00:37:33,364 --> 00:37:36,629
It's just that you said it
was gonna be a couple of days.

676
00:37:36,701 --> 00:37:39,192
Look, Molly.
He's my best friend.

677
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:42,265
Somehow I feel
responsible for him.

678
00:37:43,341 --> 00:37:47,505
Then maybe it's time to start
prioritizing your responsibilities.

679
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:50,804
You're right.

680
00:37:52,684 --> 00:37:55,653
What if he had a girlfriend? Good idea.

681
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,781
But how is a guy with no job, no
car, living on somebody's couch

682
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:03,520
gonna find any kind of
girlfriend? Our new librarian.

683
00:38:03,628 --> 00:38:05,220
She seems really nice.

684
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:08,857
You want to fix Dupree up
with a really nice librarian?

685
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:11,800
Listen, I know the guy
for 25 years.

686
00:38:11,869 --> 00:38:16,670
I think he's more into the young,
foreign, non-librarian type.

687
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:20,177
Well, it wouldn't hurt to ask.
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

688
00:38:20,645 --> 00:38:21,839
I'll do it.

689
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,077
Oh, that's great. Do you want
to know anything about her?

690
00:38:26,184 --> 00:38:29,347
No. Well, does she have a car?

691
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,012
Yeah. She does.

692
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:35,317
Good. See if she can swing by and
get me around 8:00. Or quarter to.

693
00:38:35,393 --> 00:38:36,826
Tonight?
Please.

694
00:38:36,894 --> 00:38:38,486
Okay.
Candy?

695
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,858
Mandy.
Mandy. That's even better.

696
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,735
Librarian.

697
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:52,335
No. No.

698
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,975
I thought you were
really brave.

699
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:56,036
I mean, I have a whole new
respect for you, Carl.

700
00:38:56,114 --> 00:38:58,844
Well, the rice was okay,
but just for the record,

701
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:01,214
octopus does not
taste like chicken.

702
00:39:01,953 --> 00:39:03,545
But you ate it.

703
00:39:05,323 --> 00:39:06,813
What is that?

704
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:09,225
Funky Cold Medina?

705
00:39:09,293 --> 00:39:11,284
It looks like Dupree
brought his date home.

706
00:39:11,396 --> 00:39:14,194
Honey, what is a tie
doing on our door?

707
00:39:14,365 --> 00:39:18,859
Molly, I think we ought to drive
around the block a couple times.

708
00:39:18,936 --> 00:39:21,370
Wait a minute. No way.
Mandy's a Mormon.

709
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:22,804
She's not the kind of girl...
A Mormon?

710
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:24,306
...who would get busy
on the first date.

711
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:26,877
You fixed Dupree up
with a Mormon librarian.

712
00:39:28,746 --> 00:39:30,043
Molly, wait!

713
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:39,450
Oh, my God.
What?

714
00:39:39,524 --> 00:39:41,253
Let's drive
around the block.

715
00:39:41,492 --> 00:39:42,789
Carl!

716
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:45,426
That butter dish
was our wedding gift.

717
00:39:45,496 --> 00:39:48,124
Guys, guys! Hold it! Let me explain.
What was he doing with butter?

718
00:39:48,232 --> 00:39:51,133
Dupree, no need to explain.
It's not what it looks like.

719
00:39:51,235 --> 00:39:52,964
Dupree, no explanation
necessary. I know.

720
00:39:53,071 --> 00:39:54,163
Go back in the house!

721
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:56,263
Not before I thank Molly
for the best night of my life.

722
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,137
Mol, Mol. Thank you.

723
00:39:58,209 --> 00:40:00,700
What happened in there, it
was so natural. So beautiful.

724
00:40:00,778 --> 00:40:03,178
Go back inside. Listen, I've
got neighbors. I know you do.

725
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:04,441
But listen to me.
I'm in love.

726
00:40:04,515 --> 00:40:07,177
Dupree. Dupree, I'm not going
to do this with you tonight!

727
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:10,083
Jesus! Molly, call the
fire department! Oh, my...

728
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:12,749
Carl!
Mandy!

729
00:40:12,824 --> 00:40:14,519
Mandy! Mandy!

730
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:17,458
Fire in our house!
It's fire!

731
00:40:17,528 --> 00:40:19,428
My couch!
Roll!

732
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:36,704
God, I loved this couch.

733
00:40:39,117 --> 00:40:40,880
WOMAN ON PA.. Rescue 115...

734
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,956
You know, when I saw you
on fire, my heart stopped.

735
00:40:46,023 --> 00:40:49,481
I had so much adrenaline pumping
through me, I probably could have...

736
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,462
Could have picked up this car
and just hurled it 10 blocks.

737
00:40:54,398 --> 00:40:57,492
Are you gonna do this,
or am I gonna have to?

738
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:01,399
I'll take care of it.
Tonight, Carl.

739
00:41:02,974 --> 00:41:04,532
Go on, get out of here.

740
00:41:04,642 --> 00:41:07,543
Or I'm not responsible for what
these hands are gonna do. Go!

741
00:41:14,218 --> 00:41:15,344
Bye.

742
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,883
You okay?
Yeah.

743
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:24,456
Yeah, just a little
smoke inhalation.

744
00:41:30,134 --> 00:41:33,103
Wow. Unbelievable.

745
00:41:33,871 --> 00:41:35,702
Mandy was
completely unharmed.

746
00:41:35,773 --> 00:41:39,573
Fire chief said that the
butter probably saved her life.

747
00:41:39,644 --> 00:41:43,239
You talk about a miracle. You
just got to thank the big man.

748
00:41:43,314 --> 00:41:45,145
It's all you can...

749
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:50,720
What is wrong with you? Why did
you have to use so many candles?

750
00:41:50,788 --> 00:41:53,222
I was just trying
to set a mood.

751
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:55,288
You know how I am, Carl.

752
00:41:55,393 --> 00:41:57,224
Yeah. I do.

753
00:42:00,731 --> 00:42:01,959
Look...

754
00:42:04,135 --> 00:42:06,763
It's about time
you got on the road.

755
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,680
You guys need any help?
No, we're good. Relax.

756
00:42:30,795 --> 00:42:33,491
Well,
I had a lovely stay.

757
00:42:34,098 --> 00:42:36,658
Thank you both
for your generosity.

758
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:41,463
Sorry about last night,
and no hard feelings.

759
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:44,201
I hope. At least,
there are none on my part.

760
00:42:44,308 --> 00:42:49,336
Okay. Are you sure you got a place
to go? Yeah. I got a place to go.

761
00:42:49,447 --> 00:42:51,142
Going to Mandy's.

762
00:42:51,515 --> 00:42:52,982
The librarian?

763
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,484
Don't you think that's kind of
moving a little quickly, Dupree?

764
00:42:55,553 --> 00:42:57,111
Maybe it is, but so what?

765
00:42:57,188 --> 00:43:01,352
Something special is happening
there. I'm not gonna fight it.

766
00:43:01,459 --> 00:43:04,223
Hey, take care of this
big mook for me.

767
00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:07,292
Bye. See you guys.

768
00:43:07,732 --> 00:43:09,461
Tosh, listen.

769
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:12,127
You got the heart
of a damn lion.

770
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:16,863
I respect you. You took a beating,
but you took it like a man.

771
00:43:17,642 --> 00:43:19,507
God bless all of you.

772
00:43:26,717 --> 00:43:28,048
Goodbye!

773
00:43:29,353 --> 00:43:30,911
Off to Mandy's!

774
00:43:33,057 --> 00:43:35,525
Oh, my God! Carl.

775
00:43:41,332 --> 00:43:43,664
Okay! Sir, are you sure you're okay?

776
00:43:43,734 --> 00:43:45,565
My helmet saved me.

777
00:43:49,373 --> 00:43:52,706
You see that?
He's gonna be fine.

778
00:43:52,777 --> 00:43:55,211
Here's your bag.
Thank you.

779
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,079
Bye!

780
00:44:04,789 --> 00:44:05,949
Bye.

781
00:44:08,592 --> 00:44:09,786
Carl.

782
00:44:11,395 --> 00:44:12,589
Carl?

783
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:16,961
We've been staring at this for over
two hours. Let's go get some dinner.

784
00:44:17,068 --> 00:44:21,095
Or margaritas.
Celebrate our emancipation.

785
00:44:21,939 --> 00:44:26,069
The insurance adjuster
recommended that we sue Dupree.

786
00:44:26,711 --> 00:44:30,147
For a moose head?

787
00:44:32,149 --> 00:44:33,639
Just curious.

788
00:44:40,324 --> 00:44:43,452
It was the margarita
that did it, wasn't it?

789
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:48,257
It was the emancipation
that did it.

790
00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:51,264
I like this song.

791
00:44:51,335 --> 00:44:54,099
Smooth ta-ta-ria

792
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,265
She makes a smooth margarita

793
00:44:59,343 --> 00:45:02,608
We had some good margaritas

794
00:45:05,816 --> 00:45:08,080
Oh, my God.
What?

795
00:45:15,526 --> 00:45:18,654
Are you kidding me?
What the hell is he doing?

796
00:45:18,763 --> 00:45:21,095
I thought
he was going to Mandy's.

797
00:45:21,165 --> 00:45:23,759
Honey, I don't think
he can see us.

798
00:45:24,101 --> 00:45:26,592
Maybe we should
just keep going.

799
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:28,661
It's pouring rain outside.

800
00:45:28,773 --> 00:45:31,867
Not that bad.
Honey, look at him.

801
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:41,511
What?

802
00:45:42,553 --> 00:45:43,986
Damn it.

803
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:45,955
Molly. Molly!

804
00:45:47,124 --> 00:45:48,386
Dupree!

805
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:54,695
Dupree.

806
00:45:54,799 --> 00:45:58,394
Dupree, what are you doing?
It's pouring rain outside.

807
00:45:58,636 --> 00:46:01,127
I don't know
what I'm doing anymore.

808
00:46:01,205 --> 00:46:04,732
Yeah, well, what about Mandy? Don't ask.

809
00:46:14,685 --> 00:46:17,051
Carl, can you get his bike?

810
00:46:18,722 --> 00:46:21,589
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go home.

811
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,889
Carl, honey, bike.

812
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:35,761
Carl!
I'm coming!

813
00:46:41,011 --> 00:46:43,377
I really appreciate this,
guys.

814
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:49,249
Trust me, no more open flames.
I've learned my lesson.

815
00:46:49,353 --> 00:46:52,049
All right, well,
it's been a long night.

816
00:46:52,123 --> 00:46:54,284
So, I'm gonna go to bed.

817
00:46:55,126 --> 00:46:58,220
Dupree, try not to go to sleep
with that head wet. Okay?

818
00:46:58,295 --> 00:47:00,092
Good night, Molly.

819
00:47:02,366 --> 00:47:06,132
Dupree. I don't mean
to come down on you,

820
00:47:06,737 --> 00:47:08,967
but you need to start
getting your life together.

821
00:47:09,073 --> 00:47:10,563
We're grown-ups now.
Yeah.

822
00:47:10,641 --> 00:47:13,576
You know what I mean? I
know. I know. You're right.

823
00:47:13,644 --> 00:47:17,273
And if you're going to stay here, things
are gonna be different from now on.

824
00:47:17,348 --> 00:47:18,508
No more naked stuff.

825
00:47:18,616 --> 00:47:21,176
Well, it felt natural to
be naked. I... I don't care!

826
00:47:21,285 --> 00:47:23,185
Okay.
I do not care.

827
00:47:23,354 --> 00:47:26,118
Clean up after yourself,
watch the noise,

828
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:28,852
try to help out
around the house, please?

829
00:47:28,959 --> 00:47:31,018
It's not too much to ask.

830
00:47:31,328 --> 00:47:32,818
You're right.

831
00:47:35,766 --> 00:47:40,032
Carl? I can be really helpful
when I set my mind to it.

832
00:47:40,371 --> 00:47:42,703
And that's what I'm gonna do.

833
00:47:43,507 --> 00:47:44,872
Oh, and...

834
00:47:50,314 --> 00:47:51,975
Another thing.

835
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:55,485
Would you mind writing
some thank-you notes for me?

836
00:47:56,987 --> 00:47:58,215
Okay.

837
00:47:58,322 --> 00:48:00,483
Yeah. That'd be great.

838
00:48:01,892 --> 00:48:03,860
Try to get some sleep.

839
00:48:08,566 --> 00:48:10,466
Gut-check time, Dupree.

840
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,194
"Dear Aunt Kathy.

841
00:49:11,262 --> 00:49:16,825
"Thank you so much
for the wine glasses."

842
00:49:47,498 --> 00:49:49,398
MAN ON TV.. And this, of
course, is the point of the race

843
00:49:49,466 --> 00:49:51,627
where speed will play
a major factor,

844
00:49:51,735 --> 00:49:54,966
where long months of training
certainly pay off.

845
00:49:55,272 --> 00:49:56,398
Hello?

846
00:49:56,473 --> 00:49:58,737
Yeah, Dupree. I'm gonna
need you to do me a solid.

847
00:49:58,809 --> 00:49:59,969
Yeah, no problem.
What do you got?

848
00:50:00,077 --> 00:50:04,639
I promised Molly I would give this
Career Day presentation today at 1:00.

849
00:50:04,748 --> 00:50:06,807
But her father just dropped
a big one on me,

850
00:50:06,917 --> 00:50:10,182
so I'm gonna need you
to step in and fill in for me.

851
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:11,447
Can you do that?

852
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:12,682
I don't know, Carl.

853
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:15,315
I don't know the first thing
about the development business.

854
00:50:15,426 --> 00:50:18,020
I really think Mr. Thompson
might find me in over my head.

855
00:50:18,128 --> 00:50:20,995
No, not the development
business. School, Dupree.

856
00:50:21,098 --> 00:50:23,259
CARL.. I'm gonna need you to
fill in for me at Molly's school.

857
00:50:23,334 --> 00:50:24,665
No, no, no. Not this time.

858
00:50:24,768 --> 00:50:27,134
What? No, no, I'm talking
to Lance Armstrong.

859
00:50:27,204 --> 00:50:29,297
He's trying to break away from
the pack. I got him, though.

860
00:50:29,373 --> 00:50:33,207
Will you quit dicking around with your
little Huffy bike and listen to me?
