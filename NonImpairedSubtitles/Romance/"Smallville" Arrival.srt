00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,765
<i>Previously on Smallville ...</i>

2
00:00:03,021 --> 00:00:04,230
Tell me what you've got

3
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:09,137
Jor-El: I've warned you that the elements
could not fall into the hands of a human.

4
00:00:09,138 --> 00:00:11,589
The three must become one.

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,906
No!

6
00:00:26,847 --> 00:00:31,608
In approximately 3 hours,
a meteor shower will hit Smallville.

7
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:35,766
I want you to have this.
I somehow know that it's meant for you.

8
00:00:35,914 --> 00:00:40,016
Your curiousity always land you in
dangerous positions.

9
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:43,830
Lex: Where is it?
- You just want the stone, don't you?

10
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:45,969
I don't have the stone.

11
00:00:46,804 --> 00:00:50,981
Lex: Who did this? You know more than
you're telling me, Chloe.

12
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:52,048
Who took the element?!

13
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:54,800
Lana, you're talking like we're never
going to see each other again.

14
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:56,742
I love you.

15
00:00:57,003 --> 00:00:58,450
I love you too.

16
00:01:27,528 --> 00:01:30,663
<i>And now, the Season Premiere of
Smallville.</i>

17
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,352
Jor-El: Kal-El, you have travelled far.

18
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:49,221
One journey has ended.
A new journey is about to begin.

19
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:57,701
Welcome home, my son.

Police: Open fire!

00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:40,801
Where's the girl?

33
00:06:41,136 --> 00:06:46,136
She's irrelavent. We must find Kal-El.

Oh my god!

00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:32,643
Sweetheart!

37
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,500
Martha?

38
00:07:37,468 --> 00:07:40,468
Mr. Kent? Are you OK?

39
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,000
Mrs. Kent? Clark?

40
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,383
Clark wasn't here. He's alright.
Martha?

41
00:07:49,314 --> 00:07:50,814
Mrs. Kent?

42
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,000
Martha?

43
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,700
Here! She's here.

44
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,500
Oh god!

45
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,100
Sweetheart? I'm going to
get you out of here.

46
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:32,132
She's barely breathing.

47
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,500
She's going to be fine.

48
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,640
We're going to get you out of here.

49
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,500
Can you help me?

50
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,000
Come on.

51
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Chloe?

52
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,100
Chloe?

53
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,600
Where did you go, Chloe?

54
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:29,317
<i>That's a Palm Treo 650!!! Cool!!! :-)</i>

55
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,000
Where'd you go, Chloe?

56
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,300
Everthing's under control here, officers.
I'm sure you're needed elsewhere.

57
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,500
He has the key.

58
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,699
Who are you?

59
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,999
Are you Kal-El?

60
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Who wants to know?

61
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,500
This is not him.
Kal-El would not bleed.

62
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,100
Clark?

63
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,500
Clark!

64
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,499
I thought Krypton was destroyed.

65
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,500
<i>Jor-El: It was. But here,
in your fortress of solitude,</i>

66
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:47,999
<i>the geography of our planet has been
replicated for your training.</i>

67
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I know there's a lot I can learn from you.
But I have to go home.

68
00:11:52,026 --> 00:11:53,526
I'm needed there.

69
00:11:53,527 --> 00:11:57,527
<i>The meteor shower
is only the start.</i>

70
00:11:57,528 --> 00:12:02,028
<i>A dark force from Krypton
has been awakened, Kal-El.</i>

71
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:06,181
<i>And it is coming to earth.</i>

72
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,414
What do you want me to do?

73
00:12:11,576 --> 00:12:14,576
<i>You must do as I tell you.</i>

74
00:12:14,577 --> 00:12:16,577
<i>Study this.</i>

75
00:12:16,578 --> 00:12:22,578
<i>That is the only way
to save this planet</i>

76
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Clark!

77
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Chloe: Clark, can you hear me?
Help!

78
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,000
Clark!

79
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,600
Chloe!

80
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,600
<i>Kal-El!</i>

81
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:26,601
<i>You must continue your education.
You cannot stop.</i>

82
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,866
She's my friend! She needs help!

83
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:34,667
<i>Your destiny is far greater than
saving one human life.</i>

84
00:14:34,668 --> 00:14:36,968
No! I won't let her die!

85
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:40,969
<i>Each time you let human emotions guide you,</i>

86
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:44,970
<i>you put the fate of
the entire planet at risk.</i>

87
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:47,471
<i>That is your weakness, Kal-El.</i>

88
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:50,472
Please! I'm begging you!

89
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,700
<i>Very well.</i>

90
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:58,201
<i>Under one condition.</i>

91
00:14:58,202 --> 00:15:03,402
<i>You must return to me
before the sun sets.</i>

92
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,403
I'll be back. I promise.

93
00:15:06,404 --> 00:15:12,404
<i>Do not fail, Kal-El!
Or the consequences will be grave.</i>

94
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:15,581
You have my word.

95
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:18,682
Chloe: Hey.

96
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,700
I think it's time you switch into
Super-Clark mode now.

97
00:15:24,568 --> 00:15:27,068
Super-Clark?

98
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:31,275
I know you run faster than
a speeding bullet, Clark.

99
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:35,692
Take me along for the ride.

100
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,023
Go Clark!

101
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,000
Lana! What happened?

102
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:05,801
They're still out there!
They'll kill us if they find us.

103
00:16:05,802 --> 00:16:07,631
It's OK. You're safe now.

104
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:09,867
Lana, I'll call a doctor.

105
00:16:10,058 --> 00:16:13,217
You don't understand.
We're not safe!

106
00:16:13,218 --> 00:16:15,718
Don't touch me!
- Lana!

107
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:19,135
You're in shock. It's over!

108
00:16:19,136 --> 00:16:24,136
The meteor shower stopped.
It's over.

109
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,311
There's a man and a woman.
They're right behind us!

110
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:33,632
They came out of a...

111
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:37,133
What did they come out of?

112
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,250
A space ship.

113
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,700
Where?

114
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:46,051
Lander's Field.

115
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:50,275
Lana, after what you've been through,

116
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,799
it's normal that your mind
is playing tricks on you.

117
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,587
No! Lex, you trust me.
I know what I saw.

118
00:16:58,588 --> 00:17:02,588
We have to get as far away as possible.

119
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,900
Thank you.

120
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,800
I wonder who's more freaked out right now.

121
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:33,597
Me, knowing that I'm in a hospital where
they get their medicine by dog sled...

122
00:17:33,598 --> 00:17:39,598
or you, finally finding out
that I know your secret.

123
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
How long have you known?

124
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:48,501
I guess I've always suspected. The quick
exits, the miraculous recoveries...

125
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:50,002
the lame excuses...

126
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:55,920
but when I saw you catch a car
like it was a beach ball...

127
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:59,031
that confirmed everything.

128
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,673
Why didn't you say anything?

129
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:15,674
I figured that you would,
when you were ready.

130
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:19,932
on your terms, not on mine.

131
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,433
You're a good friend, Chloe.

132
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Obviously not good enough.

133
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:33,861
There were so many times
I wanted to tell you.

134
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:38,377
Clark, I don't blame you.

135
00:18:42,894 --> 00:18:46,361
What about Lana? Does she know?

136
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:54,913
No.

137
00:18:55,624 --> 00:18:59,229
Well, I want you to know that
I will never tell anyone.

138
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I will keep your secret safe.
No matter what.

139
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,500
I appreciate that.

140
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,199
I still have a few questions, though.

141
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Like, how did we get transported from
the cave to the North Pole?

142
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:25,201
And what was going on in that ice cave?

143
00:19:25,202 --> 00:19:31,202
Chloe, there are a lot of things that
even I don't understand.

144
00:19:32,803 --> 00:19:36,590
The meteor rocks...

145
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:40,728
they didn't make me who I am.

146
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:44,729
So you were born this way?

147
00:19:46,364 --> 00:19:52,228
I wasn't born anywhere near Smallville.

148
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:58,229
In fact, I wasn't born in this galaxy.

149
00:19:58,606 --> 00:20:02,173
Okay...

150
00:20:02,174 --> 00:20:05,672
So that would make you like an...

151
00:20:05,673 --> 00:20:07,218
Yeah.

152
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:16,115
Uh, but you look so...

153
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:19,286
human?

154
00:20:22,162 --> 00:20:25,662
I'm still the same person.

155
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:32,006
Clark, I...

156
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,507
I think you're so amazing.

157
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:39,601
You save people's lives and
take no credit for it.

158
00:20:39,602 --> 00:20:42,552
To me, you're more than just a hero.

159
00:20:42,553 --> 00:20:44,887
You're a Super hero.

160
00:20:44,888 --> 00:20:45,888
Chloe...

161
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:51,889
I'm serious, Clark. If more humans were
like you, the world would be a better place.

162
00:21:15,216 --> 00:21:21,216
<i>News: ... Smallville was hit by the
second meteor shower in 16 years...</i>

163
00:21:21,216 --> 00:21:25,093
<i>killing 23 people and injuring many others.</i>

164
00:21:25,094 --> 00:21:28,094
They didn't get out.
My parents didn't get out.

165
00:21:28,095 --> 00:21:30,118
Smallville needs you more than I do, Clark.

166
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,619
Go.

167
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,042
Go!

168
00:21:39,336 --> 00:21:41,836
Whoa.

169
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:55,069
<i>Scratching sound</i>

170
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:12,800
<i>Scratching sound continues</i>

171
00:22:46,563 --> 00:22:49,173
Mr. Luthor.

172
00:22:54,345 --> 00:22:56,345
Are you okay?

173
00:22:57,239 --> 00:23:01,339
They are desciples of Zard.

174
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:06,835
They must be stopped.

175
00:23:06,836 --> 00:23:10,836
You're talking about the
people from the ship!

176
00:23:13,857 --> 00:23:17,338
Their home is their only poison.

177
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:31,970
Their home is their only poison.

178
00:23:44,554 --> 00:23:47,211
Where are they?

179
00:24:09,998 --> 00:24:14,748
Oh, Martha Kent. If you're trying to scare
me, you're doing a very good job!

180
00:24:14,749 --> 00:24:17,949
For a minute I thought I lost you.

181
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:22,950
I guess I've found my way back.

182
00:24:22,951 --> 00:24:26,451
Has Clark come home?

183
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:33,400
Sweetheart, please. You need to rest.
Don't worry about Clark.

184
00:24:33,401 --> 00:24:37,901
Our son can handle anything
that is thrown his way.

185
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,632
Mrs. Kent! I must say,
you look much better...

186
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:51,134
without a cabinet on your back!

187
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,000
Hi Lois. It's good to see you.

188
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:55,609
Lois was quite a hero out there.

189
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:59,693
You guys are very kind to me.
I'm glad I could help.

190
00:25:22,095 --> 00:25:24,095
Where is Kal-El?

191
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:26,096
Who are you?

192
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,849
You know where he is.

193
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,850
I'm sorry, lady. I don't know
who you're talking about.

194
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,305
Hey! Everyone needs to calm down, OK?

195
00:25:39,306 --> 00:25:42,006
So put the nice man down.

196
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:50,791
Look, super freak. You want to find Kal-El?

197
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:54,992
Then you better start working on
your communication skills.

198
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:01,886
I know where Kal-El is.

199
00:26:02,692 --> 00:26:07,692
He's hiding at the Luthor mansion.
I can take you to him.

200
00:26:26,663 --> 00:26:28,209
Mum!

201
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,710
Dad?

202
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,181
Clark!

203
00:26:41,438 --> 00:26:44,938
Thank god you're okay.
- Where's my mum and dad?

204
00:26:44,939 --> 00:26:49,847
At the hospital. Your mum has a head
injury and a broken leg, but she'll be okay.

205
00:26:49,848 --> 00:26:51,382
She's out of danger now.

206
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:52,833
What about Lana?

207
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:54,834
Lana's safe.

208
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
It's Chloe I'm worried about.

209
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,600
Why?

210
00:27:01,601 --> 00:27:06,101
Clark, she was down in the cave with me
when the meteors hit.

211
00:27:06,102 --> 00:27:10,602
I was knocked out. But
when I woke up she was gone.

212
00:27:10,603 --> 00:27:15,603
She must have escaped while
you were unconcious.

213
00:27:16,404 --> 00:27:19,904
Or someone helped her.

214
00:27:20,699 --> 00:27:24,199
What? You think I did?
Lex, how could I...

215
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Before I fainted, there was a light
brighter than anything I've ever seen.

216
00:27:31,014 --> 00:27:35,514
I swear, I saw you standing right there,
in the middle of the light.

217
00:27:36,883 --> 00:27:39,383
I was not at the caves.

218
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,200
If you weren't with your parents when the
meteors hit, where have you been?

219
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:47,501
They insisted that I must get out of
Smallville. I got a ride on a military van.

220
00:27:47,502 --> 00:27:50,802
Then why do I feel that you are not
being honest with me?

221
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:52,219
I have no idea.

222
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,420
I'm beginning to think that
you have a habit of lying, Clark.

223
00:27:55,421 --> 00:27:56,921
I don't have to listen to this.

224
00:27:56,922 --> 00:27:59,922
Then tell me the truth.

225
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,199
If you're my friend, just tell me the truth.

226
00:28:11,603 --> 00:28:14,072
Were you in the cave when the meteors hit?

227
00:28:15,175 --> 00:28:16,675
No.

228
00:28:33,949 --> 00:28:39,949
I understand that the police have their
hands full, but Mr. and Mrs. "Universe"...

229
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,450
they're killing people!

230
00:28:41,451 --> 00:28:42,751
Lois!

231
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,500
Clark! You're okay?

232
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:46,901
Yeah, you?

233
00:28:46,902 --> 00:28:47,902
Yeah, I'm fine.

234
00:28:47,903 --> 00:28:49,603
Have you seen my parents?

235
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:51,104
They're going to be fine.

236
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:53,105
Where are they?

237
00:28:55,415 --> 00:28:57,215
Actually, umm...

238
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,895
we have another problem...

239
00:28:58,896 --> 00:29:01,096
kind of a big problem, really.

240
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:06,297
A happy loving couple came in here with
Super powers and really bad attitude.

241
00:29:06,298 --> 00:29:08,798
It got pretty ugly.

242
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,590
What did they want?

243
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:16,129
They were looking for some guy named Kal-El.
Have you heard of him?

244
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:21,729
Where did they go?

245
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Kal-El is in there.

246
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It's a trap!

247
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,400
Get the door! Seal it!

248
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,250
Lying is their way.

249
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,551
Not for long.

250
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,900
I heard you were looking for me.

251
00:30:17,678 --> 00:30:19,478
I'm Kal-El.

252
00:30:20,615 --> 00:30:21,915
At last!

253
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,100
Who are you?

254
00:30:26,462 --> 00:30:28,462
The last survivors of Krypton.

255
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,600
What do you want?

256
00:30:31,752 --> 00:30:34,587
We want you to join us, Kal-El.

257
00:30:34,588 --> 00:30:37,588
And help us make this savage land
our utopia.

258
00:30:37,782 --> 00:30:40,855
I saw what you did at the hospital.
It's not utopia... it's murder!

259
00:30:40,856 --> 00:30:43,756
The few must be sacrificed for
the sake of the many.

260
00:30:43,757 --> 00:30:45,757
Then sacrifice me.

261
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,300
Because I'm not going to
let you kill anyone else.

262
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:54,726
If that is your decision, so be it, Kal-El.

263
00:31:16,572 --> 00:31:19,319
We cannot destroy you, Kal-El.

264
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,603
But we can lock you in a place where
you will never be able to stop us.

265
00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:42,732
It is done.

266
00:32:38,295 --> 00:32:39,995
Oh, Clark!

267
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,300
Are you okay?

268
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:47,009
Where are they?

269
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,210
They're gone.

270
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,600
Do you know who they were?

271
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:02,710
<i>Mel, remember Jor-El asked Clark to go back to him before the sun set?</i>

272
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,520
We need to get you to a hospital.

273
00:33:09,795 --> 00:33:11,295
Ah!

274
00:33:11,296 --> 00:33:16,796
<i>Jor-El took Clark's powers away bcs he disoboyed.</i>

275
00:33:49,325 --> 00:33:51,474
Oh my god!

276
00:33:51,475 --> 00:33:53,975
Our home!

277
00:33:57,412 --> 00:34:00,192
It's just wood and plaster, Martha.

278
00:34:00,193 --> 00:34:04,383
Our family is still standing.
We might be a little bruised...

279
00:34:04,384 --> 00:34:07,239
but I think we're stronger because of it.

280
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:11,958
You're right. A house can always be rebuilt.

281
00:34:12,658 --> 00:34:15,658
It doesn't hurt to have a one-man
construction team as a son.

282
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,659
Hi!

283
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,100
Hi.

284
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:25,224
Don't worry, Clark. Things are going to
get back to normal soon enough.

285
00:34:25,225 --> 00:34:30,225
Actually, things will be a lot more
normal around here than you think.

286
00:34:32,956 --> 00:34:35,456
My powers are gone.

287
00:34:36,988 --> 00:34:37,988
How?

288
00:34:39,266 --> 00:34:41,766
Jor-El took them.

289
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:44,833
But I think it's not a bad thing.

290
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:49,334
All I ever wanted was to be normal.
And now, finally...

291
00:34:49,335 --> 00:34:50,335
I am.

292
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I don't think that this adjustment
is going to be easy, Clark.

293
00:34:57,001 --> 00:34:59,956
That's why I'm lucky to
have parents like you.

294
00:34:59,957 --> 00:35:04,311
Everytime I discovered a new ability,
you were always there to help me adjust.

295
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:05,375
This time is not different.

296
00:35:05,376 --> 00:35:07,060
It is different!

297
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:09,207
You can get hurt now.

298
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:12,008
You're vulnerable!

299
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:15,182
Isn't that what it means to be human?

300
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:19,983
No. I can't imagine Jor-El
giving up on you that easily.

301
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:23,759
I took care of the danger
he warned me about.

302
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,760
I think the consequence of that is
losing my abilities.

303
00:35:31,939 --> 00:35:36,439
Look, it's all in the past now.

304
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,750
I'm ready to take a step to the future.

305
00:35:42,025 --> 00:35:47,025
Let's start by rebuilding this house.
One board at a time.

306
00:36:16,963 --> 00:36:18,963
Clark?

307
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:23,058
Now, how could Clark possibly be here?

308
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:25,960
We're in the middle of the Yukon.

309
00:36:25,961 --> 00:36:27,943
I don't know...

310
00:36:27,944 --> 00:36:31,444
I must have been dreaming.

311
00:36:32,573 --> 00:36:34,430
What's going on, Lex?

312
00:36:34,431 --> 00:36:36,931
I came to take you home.

313
00:36:44,432 --> 00:36:45,575
Clark!

314
00:36:45,576 --> 00:36:46,672
Really, you shouldn't have.

315
00:36:46,673 --> 00:36:47,673
Actually, I didn't.

316
00:36:47,674 --> 00:36:48,674
You're too sweet for words.

317
00:36:48,675 --> 00:36:50,675
What happened to your voice?

318
00:36:50,676 --> 00:36:55,176
That's what happened when you get a neck
massage from Barbie the barbarian.

319
00:36:55,177 --> 00:36:57,977
The doctor said I shouldn't talk too much.

320
00:36:57,978 --> 00:36:59,478
Gee, that's too bad.

321
00:36:59,479 --> 00:37:02,328
Don't be too happy, Clark.
It's not permanent.

322
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:06,867
I have to get to the airport.
My dad will kill me if I'm late.

323
00:37:06,868 --> 00:37:09,595
I wanted to say thank you.

324
00:37:11,016 --> 00:37:13,603
You were there for my parents.
It means a lot to me.

325
00:37:15,338 --> 00:37:18,136
I'm sure it does.

326
00:37:18,137 --> 00:37:19,337
But...

327
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:24,350
not enough to give me these flowers.

328
00:37:25,405 --> 00:37:28,305
She's in room 258.

329
00:37:57,736 --> 00:38:00,736
I hope irises are still your
favourite flowers.

330
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,446
Some things stay number 1 forever.

331
00:38:04,447 --> 00:38:05,639
Thank you.

332
00:38:12,403 --> 00:38:16,403
Lana, before the meteor shower,
when you came by the barn...

333
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:20,404
you said some things...

334
00:38:20,405 --> 00:38:24,772
and 3 words sort of stood out.

335
00:38:26,527 --> 00:38:30,360
Clark, this guy was just about
to fall down on us...

336
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:33,861
I never knew if I'd
ever to see you again.

337
00:38:33,862 --> 00:38:35,062
Right...

338
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:37,397
We were in the middle of a crisis.

339
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:41,198
Sometimes people say things they don't mean.

340
00:38:44,511 --> 00:38:46,811
Clark...

341
00:38:52,948 --> 00:38:56,448
I meant every word.

342
00:39:07,522 --> 00:39:11,244
The question is...

343
00:39:11,245 --> 00:39:14,745
did you?

344
00:39:27,055 --> 00:39:30,055
No more secrets.

345
00:39:30,556 --> 00:39:33,556
No more lies.

346
00:39:37,284 --> 00:39:41,284
Clark, I want to ask you something...

347
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:48,510
Do you believe in life on other planets?

348
00:39:51,732 --> 00:39:55,732
Actually, I do.

349
00:39:56,941 --> 00:39:59,441
I saw something in that crator.

350
00:39:59,442 --> 00:40:03,442
It was a space ship, Clark!

351
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:07,443
It was unbelievable.
