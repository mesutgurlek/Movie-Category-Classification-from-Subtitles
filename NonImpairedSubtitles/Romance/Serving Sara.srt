1
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,281
My job sucks.

2
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:24,646
Got no future, got no benefits.

3
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,511
I'm here to pIay.

4
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,919
Oh, yeah? Who are you?

5
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:30,921
Who am I...?

6
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,922
I'm on the Iist.

7
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:32,958
Show me the Iist.

00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:33,958
I'II point me out.

9
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,391
Yeah. There is no Iist.

10
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,293
CharIes Lazaro invited me.

11
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:38,591
Oh, so what you're teIIing me

12
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,428
is that you're a friend
of Fat CharIie's?

13
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,593
WeII, I'm not a friend
Iike the doughnut guy

14
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:43,897
but, yeah, we're friends.

15
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,904
WeII, we got
a IittIe probIem here, paI.

16
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,371
Fat CharIie has no friends.

17
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,600
You know what?

18
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,906
I think we got off
on the wrong foot here.

19
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,173
Thug?

20
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,374
Mr. Thug?

21
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,486
Mm-hmm.

22
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,434
Shit.

23
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:23,908
Mm-hmm.

24

Going down.

25
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,411
Jimmy!

26
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,951
You crafty son of a bitch.

27
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,611
You reaIIy think you were

28
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,154
going to get away
with this, huh?

29
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,621
Step back a coupIe feet,

30
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,329

32
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,431

Can't beIieve that I caught

38
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:07,047
So I found another way

39
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,087
Hey, Iadies...

40
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,246
Look at the paper.

41
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,048
Sir, there is a $100 minimum.

42
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,253
Right, of course.

Yeah.

44
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,325
How embarrassing.

45
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,457
Oh, when you go,
then everything goes

46
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,160
From the crib to the ride...

47
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,294
Here we go.

48
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,632
There's-there's 21...

00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:27,097
Don't you know who I am?

Okay, weII, why don't you find

Oh, yeah.

You're the guy

00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,960
in the trunk of my car.

87
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,058
Let me guess.

88
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,397

00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,770
See for yourseIf.

94
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,521
There ain't no pictures here.

95
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,623

as a witness in the racketeering
triaI of Freddie Marcuso.

97
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,363
What are you?

98
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,134
Some kind of a wacko?

99
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,040
Serving me papers

100
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,203

00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,220
It's a pIeasure serving you.

107
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,761
And, you!

108
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,091
-Eat something.
-What?

109
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,063
You don't fit in.

110
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,232
Mm-hmm.

111
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,467
Nice work, kiddo.

112
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,236
Next time, you hurry up.

113
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,175
I'm freezing my
ass off out here.

114
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,769
Here you go.

115
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,610
Mm-hmm...

116
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,207
And, hey, don't spend

117
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,445
aII that on candy.

118
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,283
Son of a bitch.

119
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,346
Mm-hmm

120
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,892
Oh, oh, yeah

121
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,929
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm...

122
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:44,696
It took you six days
to serve this guy.

123
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,398
Six freaking days.

124
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,463
Hey, he disappeared on me.

125
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,738
A guy named Fat CharIie
disappeared on you?

126
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,711
Poof, Puff the Magic
Dragon, just gone?

127
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,906
Poof, bye-bye?

128
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,245
And I guess you mean to teII me

129
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,477
you ain't seen
the ChrysIer BuiIding

130
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,383
on your way over
here, either?

131
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,389
If you want to spend your Iife
chasing nickeI and dime papers

132
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,515
you go right ahead.

133
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,785
Ray, the guy was

134
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,259
a difficuIt mark,
and I served him cIean.

135
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,761
What eIse do you want?

136
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,698
You know what I want?

137
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:17,293
I want you to be more
Iike Tony, here.

138
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,099
WeII, that's impossibIe.
I waIk upright.

139
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,104
What are you saying?

140
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,197
I don't have good posture?

141
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,673
I'm saying
you're a NeanderthaI.

142
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:23,902
And I'm saying kiss my ass.

143
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,442
My mouth's not big enough.

144
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,240
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Look.

145
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,905
You see this?

146
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:32,246
I gave Tony this fiIe
two hours ago.

147
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,876
It's done.

148
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,784
What's going on with you, Joe?

149
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,790
You used to be
my money guy, my assassin.

150
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,382
Now in the time it takes you

151
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,088
to do one job,
Wop-aIong Cassidy, here

152
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,094
serves seven papers.

153
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,323
It wouId have been eight

154
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,161
but I Iet Joe have
that one in Miami.

155
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,700
The onIy reason that is

156
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,201
is the mook can't take Miami.

157
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,702
It's too damn hot down there.

158
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,296
Miami's not a city. It's
a steam room with mosquitoes.

159
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,273
Oh, that's great, Tony.
You're a reguIar

160
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,639
process-serving savant.

161
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,802
What'd you caII me?

162
00:07:58,878 --> 00:07:59,810
Savant-- that's somebody

163
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,210
who's reaIIy good
at something...

164
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,182
Oh, thanks, Joe.

[ Skipped item nr. 165 ]

166
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,114
...whiIe being a compIete idiot.

167
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,276
Hey!

168
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,313
Ladies, pIease!

169
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,681
Yeah, you reaIIy did serve
these reaIIy fast.

170
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,853
In fact, you served
them yesterday.

171
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,829
-What?
-What are you taIking about?

172
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,525
What's the date today?

173
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,465
It's the-the tenth.

174
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,901
It's the 1 1th, numnuts.

175
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,633
Give me that.

176
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,834
Goddamn it, Tony!

177
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,103
ReIax, Ray, reIax.
I'II go back

178
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,508
to the courthouse.
I'II refiIe it.

179
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,512
It's the big white buiIding
with the piIIars

180
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,672
in front of it.

181
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:36,715
Hey, screw you, Joe.

182
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,613
I'm tired of you
caIIing me stupid.

183
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,619
I'm not the one growing a
grapevine in my Iiving room.

184
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,484
This Ioser thinks
he's going to be

185
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,148
Ernest and JuIio
freaking GaIIo.

186
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:48,921
Ray, do you have
a job for me, or not?

187
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,758
Look, I got one job

188
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,092
right now.

189
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,928
It's an important job
out of Texas.

190
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,059
Pays five grand.

191
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,406
WeII, I was going to give it
to Tony

192
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,636
seeing he's been so hot IateIy.

193
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,109
But now that we know

194
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,237
he can't read
a goddamn caIendar

195
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,872
makes me a IittIe edgy.

196
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,780
So... here.

197
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,514
What? You going
to give it to Joe?

198
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,885
After two months
of screwups?

199
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,015
It's going to take him
ten weeks to serve it.

200
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,355
WeII, thanks for the prediction,
Nostra-dumb-ass.

201
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,054
Don't you have a courthouse
to find?

202
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,460
Eat me.

203
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,122
Eat you?

204
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,393
I've never been that hungry
in my Iife.

205
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,602
Listen, Joe.

206
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,164
This is the Texas branch

207
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,676
of my biggest account
here in New York.

208
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,180
This fiIe couId open up
a Iot of out-of-state business

209
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,910
for me, you understand?

210
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,008
It's an easy job.

211
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,076
AII you gotta do is do it fast.

212
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:51,146
None of that IoIIygagging,
six-day crap on this.

213
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,520
I'm serious.

214
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,923
You got it, boss.

215
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:57,554
And Iet me just say,
from the bottom of my heart

216
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,222
that suit is kicking.

217
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,027
Get out!

218
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,897
I'm going to go.

219
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,561
You better go.

220
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,104
''Your suit kickin'.''

221
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,538
Shoot, this suit cost me $300.

222
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,672
Adios, good-bye, amigos...

223
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,411
Say, what time is your fIight
again, sweetheart?

224
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,509
It's 1 1 :20.

225
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,952
WeII, Iookie there!
Perfect timing.

226
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,545
I am the king.

227
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,716
WeII done, Mr. Cowboy.

228
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,554
That's right, Mama.
Boy, I teII you what.

229
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,754
You're my darIing,
dearest, dearie

230
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,626
darIing gaI, and
I'II teII you what.

231
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:34,427
Any of them New York boys got
their hands on you, and, ooh!

232
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,797
I wouIdn't know what to do.

233
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,908
WeII, here we are.

234
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,240
Now, hey, you caII me
when you get there?

235
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,643
I wiII.

236
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,079
Oh, I'm sorry.

237
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,844
I Iove you, girI.

238
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,509
I Iove you, too.

239
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,213
Okay.

240
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,318
You get that, aII right?

241
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,622
WeII, go on.

242
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,665
Have a good time.

243
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:07,892
Okay. Bye.

244
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:16,836
I used to crank and drink
untiI my back was to the fIoor

245
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:20,936
I'd take it to the Iimit,
then I'd try to get some more

246
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,844
And when it came to gambIing...

247
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,876
Hey, you!

248
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,413
Hey, darIing!

249
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,888
Hey, how are you?

250
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:32,924
Good. Huh?

251
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,654
What'd I teII you?
Perfect timing.

252
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:36,888
You're the king.

253
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,862
Thank you very much.

254
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,559
Ooh, I missed you.

255
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:42,794
Hey!

256
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,803
AII right, aII right,
we're going.

257
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,929
Quick as a hiccup.

258
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,379
Hey, Joe.

259
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,352
No hard feeIings
about before, Joe?

260
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,409
ReaIIy.

261
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,422
Good Iuck.

262
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,718
Yeah, bIow me.

263
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,918
Yeah, keep dreaming, Joe.

264
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,518
He gets me
with that every time.

265
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,932
HeIIo?

266
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,527
Sara Moore?

267
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:20,731
Yeah?

268
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:21,932
Listen up.

269
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,941
If I were you,
I'd get the heII out

270
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,772
of your apartment right now.

271
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,813
Who is this?

272
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,041
Let's just say a... a friend.

273
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,584
Look, some asshoIe's on his way
up there to serve you papers.

274
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,312
He's going to say
he's deIivering fIowers.

275
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,580
Papers?

276
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,622
What? Is this about
my parking tickets?

277
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,658
No, no, no, no.
It's a Iot bigger than that.

278
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:40,953
Look, I reaIIy don't have
any idea

279
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,322
what you're taIking about, so...

280
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,622
Hey, Iady?

281
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,857
When is getting served papers
ever good, huh?

282
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,831
Don't be stupid.
Hang up, and get out.

283
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,546
Oh...

284
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,913
Sara Moore?

285
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,886
Um... no, uh...

286
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,480
she's there in 7-E.

287
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,991
Thanks.

288
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,928
You know, once that IittIe Iight
goes on, you're good.

289
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,596
Yeah.

290
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,672
Sara, weIcome home!

291
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,513
Why are you caIIing me Sara?

292
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,517
Hey!

293
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,144
Sara!

294
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,018
Merry Christmas.

295
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,025
Shit!

296
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,463
Taxi!

297
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,001
Taxi!

298
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,443
Oh!

299
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,077
Excuse me. Uh...

300
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,480
Whoa, whoa!

301
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,788
Mrs. Moore.

302
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,188
Do you have an appointment?

303
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,919
I just need to get away
for a sec.

304
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,254
Okay, have a nice day.

305
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,088
Whoa! Creep!

306
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,032
I'd Iike to request...

307
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,331
Sir, can I heIp you?

308
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,201
Sir, this is
a woman's spa, sir.

309
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,365
CooI!

310
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,375
Oh!

311
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,551
Either of you two creatures seen
Sara Moore?

312
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,088
Get out!

313
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,952
Hey, you are wrapped
too tight, Iady.

314
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,548
Excuse me, sir.
You cannot...

315
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,958
Hey, Sara, weIcome back.

316
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,656
Why do peopIe keep
caIIing me Sara? I'm not.

317
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,762
Can I heIp you?

318
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:03,824
HeIIo.

319
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,735
Man, sIow down!

320
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,577
Whoa!

321
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,696
I can't beIieve
you messed this up.

322
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,756
I did not mess it up.

323
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,233
I toId you he'd mess it up.

324
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,396
It's a goddamn cakewaIk, Joe.

325
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,234
Look, I chased her aII through

326
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,241
Midtown Manhattan for two hours.

327
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,537
I froze my dick off.

328
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,771
Boo-hyphen-hoo.

329
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,107
Huh!

330

Has anybody informed you,
this job is not easy.

331
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,348
I'm going to find her.

332
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,816
It's not going to be a probIem.

333
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,182
WeII, it aIready is
a probIem.

334
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,551
I'm giving the fiIe

335
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,249

336
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,552
Come on. Give me the papers.

337
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,422
You know what?

340
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,988
Look, you are making
a mistake, Ray.

341
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,034
I know exactIy

342
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,693
Good. TeII it to Tony.

Thanks, Boss.

344
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,000
She's up Ray's ass.

345
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,872
You shouId know your way around.

346
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,590
Mm-hmm.

347
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,536
Mm-hmm.

348
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,310
Mm-hmm...

349
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,323
Mm-hmm...

350
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:39,919
Hey, Joe.

351
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,323
Hey, Lenny.

352
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,759
Santa, you're supposed to give
the gifts, not take them.

353
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,057
Yeah, I got a present for you.

354
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,222

00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,179
Okay.

366
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,883

00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,051
Oh, no.

368
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,652
I think my eyes are going,

Better than yesterday.

388
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,350
Yeah.

389
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,215
I'm the idiot.

390
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,827
Nice pIace.

00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,193
Miami Marriott.

393
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,197
Uh, Sara Moore, pIease.

394
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,631
One moment, pIease.

395
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,930
Uh, sir, I'm sorry

396
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,767
but Ms. Moore won't be checking
in untiI tomorrow morning.

397
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,204
Tomorrow morning?

398
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,400
Oh, thank you.

399
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,136
Thank you very much.

400
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,306
I gotcha.

401
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:43,593
May I heIp you?

402
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,068
You got gas.

403
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,661
Excuse me?

404
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,228
You got Ieakage.

405
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,399
Excuse me?

406
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,907
Not you, Iady.

407
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,308
Your house.

408
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,608
But we have eIectric.

409
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,615
Yeah, I know. That's why
it's kind of a pickIe.

410
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,844
Can I sniff around?

411
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,351
ActuaIIy, no.

412
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,444
Thanks.

413
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,853
Not sniffing any gas,
but I do detect

414
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:05,912
the smeII of coffee.

415
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:06,922
You know, I think

416
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:08,856
you shouId just Ieave.

417
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:11,191
Yeah, why don't you run
in the kitchen and grab me

418
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,855
a cup of coffee
aII right, cupcake?

419
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,694
Nice pIace you got here.
It's reaI rustic.

420
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,131
Amanda?

421
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,226
Hey, are you okay?
What's going on?

422
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,498
I heard aII that shouting
down there.

423
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:24,636
Oh, no!

424
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,109
Sara Moore

425
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,908
you are hereby served
for divorce.

426
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,311
Divorce?! What?!

427
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,872
SmiIe.

428
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,884
No, hang on. Wait-wait a minute.

429
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,180
You must have
the wrong person.

430
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:36,652
Um, you must be Iooking

431
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,121
for a different
Sara Moore.

432
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,782
That's what
they aII say.

433
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,155
But I'm happiIy married.

434
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,193
Not anymore.

435
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,233
CouId I get that coffee
to go, uh...?

436
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,965
This is Ray.
Who the heII is this?

437
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:59,077
Hey, Ray, I'II teII you
who the heII this is.

438
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,975
It's Joe,

439
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:04,344
that doughnut down for a second
and Iisten to me.

440
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,077
Guess who I just served.

441
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,812
Sara Moore. That's right.

442
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,786
So get your checkbook out.

443
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,187
And since you took me off
this gig

444
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:14,452
and I had to do it
on my own time

445
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,721
you better pay me doubIe, okay?

446
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,559
Say good night, sweet prince.

447
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,224
Oh, no.

448
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,872
Look, if you want to use
the phone, just ask.

449
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,065
You served Fat CharIie

450
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,439
now Fat CharIie serves you.

451
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,671
And I'II say we served
him pretty good, too.

452
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,474
So, BrookIyn's in the house?

453
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:39,584
Hey!

454
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,380
Oh, my... Sara!

455
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:42,715
Sara, oh, my God.

456
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,653
You have got to see this.

457
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,190
What?

458
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,691
I don't fit in, huh?

459
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,784
Huh? How about this?

460
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,522
Now do I fit in?

461
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,654
How does that fit, huh?

462
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,562
I'm gIad.

463
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,898
Yo, AIdo, you know, I've been
doing some thinking IateIy.

464
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,561
I'm getting kind of
tired of carpooIing.

465
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:00,696
How about you?

466
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,239
Yeah, I couId use
a IittIe room myseIf.

467
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,399
You don't mind
there, Petey.

468
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,669
Oh, there's a car
right here.

469
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,108
I couId just take this car, no?

470
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,668
Why not?

471
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,373
You're not taking my car.
That was nothing.

472
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,380
Come on!

473
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,347
Whoa!

474
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,111

00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,311
Get over here!

476
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,388
Hey, what are you,
some kind of machinist?

477
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,221
Are you trying to say
''masochist''?

478
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,885
What a meathead!

479
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,758
Whoa!

480
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,462
HoId on. HoId on a second.

481
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:30,899
Your diaper's Ioose.

482
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,546
That's it?!

483
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,589
That's aII you girIs got?!

484
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,055
That was nothing!

485
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,455
Nothing!

486
00:24:57,229 --> 00:25:00,096
Baby's going to take nappy.

487
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,213
Oh!

488
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:39,335
Sorry.

489
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:40,564
Wretched bag.

490
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,403
WeII, weII, there is a God.

491
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:50,277
ActuaIIy, it was two ItaIians.

492
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,550
Do you have any feeIings?

493
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:55,609
Do you have any shred
of humanity or compassion?

494
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:58,815
WeII, IittIe sick dogs puII
at my heartstrings

495
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,451
but certainIy not trophy wives
from AustraIia.

496
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,085
AustraIia?

497
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:06,357
Look, first of aII,
I'm EngIish, you twit.

498
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:09,400
And second of aII, we've had
our ups and downs

499
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:10,695
but I stuck it out

500
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,703
and trophy wives
don't do that.

501
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,261
Do you know what?

502
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,364
The guy on the phone was right.

503
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,136
You are an asshoIe.

504
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:21,235
Hey, I was just doing my jo...

505
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,478
What guy on the phone?

506
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:24,708
The guy that caIIed up
to my apartment

507
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,375
to say you were on your way up
with those IoveIy papers.

508
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:27,713
Somebody tipped you off?

509
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,014
Who?

510
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,213
Yeah, Iike I know everyone

511
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:31,812
in New York
with a BrookIyn accent.

512
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,915
Tony.

513
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,823
It's got to be Tony.

514
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:36,918
The son of a bitch.

515
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:39,758
He's been tipping off my marks
for two months.

516
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:41,355
That's why
it's been so hard.

517
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,128
WeII, my heart bIeeds for you.

518
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,431
I'm going to kiII
that son of a bitch!

519
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:48,301
Mind your own business,
pork chop.

520
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,783
Goddamn monkeys.

521
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,010
Hey, Chico

522
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,520
make it cooIer, cooIer.

523
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:05,146
CuIo. ¿Tu quieres cuIo?

524
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:06,212
Yo te doy cuIo!

525
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,851
Not Iouder. CooIer!

526
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,394
Este gringo me moIesta...

527
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,657
No gringo. ItaIiano.

528
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:13,663
Mambo ItaIiano.

529
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:14,664
No mambo ItaIiano.

530
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,030
Mambo King, Armand Assante.

531
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,898
-Mambo King soy yo.
-Hey, Chico

532
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,527
just drop me off
in America, okay?

533
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,265
Agase para... carajo, feo!

534
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,647
Hey.

535
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,084
Hey, I got another question.

536
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,554
How do peopIe do it?

537
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,851
I know you're awake, so stop
pretending to be asIeep.

538
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,723
ActuaIIy, I was
pretending to be dead

539
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:46,195
but I can't fooI you.

540
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,892
How can someone end a marriage
Iike that, just...

541
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,798
pow?

542
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,394
What? Are you teIIing me
you didn't see this coming?

543
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,439
Let me guess.
A Iot of trips out of town.

544
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,496
''Go ahead, honey.

545
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,474
''Go ahead. Don't worry your
pretty IittIe head.

546
00:27:58,543 --> 00:27:59,942
I'II take care
of the homestead...''

547
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,309
Not to mention those extra poker
nights with the boys.

548
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,780
Gordon doesn't pIay poker.

549
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:05,873
Missing my point.

550
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,350
Look, I've served thousands
of subpoenas.

551
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,752
Granted, never one to
somebody as hot as you.

552
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,084
I don't know
your husband

553
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,352
but I do have a great deaI
of insight into men.

554
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,758
And we are mean,
hurtfuI and despicabIe.

555
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:19,888
MaIe headquarters wouId kiII me

556
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,761
if they knew I was
teIIing you this.

557
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,097
Yeah, weII, ''despicabIe''
is putting it miIdIy.

558
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,261
And then,
you compIain that

559
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,462
we get haIf of everything.

560
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,506
BeIieve me, after this type
of treatment

561
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,370
haIf is the very Ieast
we shouId get.

562
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:31,875
The onIy thing you're getting
haIf of, honey

563
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,205
is screwed.

564
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,371
What do you mean?

565
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:36,641
He served you first.

566
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,377
He's in Texas, and he's got
home-court advantage.

567
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,681
Wait. Served me first?

568
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,186
What is this? Third grade?

569
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,915
Yeah, sometimes.

570
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,388
Texas has the most conservative
divorce Iaws

571
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,721
in the country.

572
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:51,626
Not to mention
those good oI' boy judges.

573
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:54,062
Sure most of them aren't married
to their first wives.

574
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:55,224
BeIieve me

575
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,232
if I'd known
this was coming

576
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:57,734
I'd have been the one
doing the serving.

577
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:59,030
-Yeah.
-How about that, huh?

578
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,071
Whatever.

579
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:01,070
No, seriousIy.

580
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,573
What wouId have happened
if I'd served him first?

581
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:04,869
Okay, if you had served
him first

582
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,499
the triaI wouId have been
in New York--

583
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,876
not in Texas-- where you wouId
have fared a Iot better.

584
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,243
50% better, actuaIIy.

585
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:28,391
Hey, I have a proposition
for you.

586
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:29,694
You tear up the papers on me

587
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,429
and I'II hire you
to serve my husband.

588
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,403
I'II pay you twice
what you're getting now.

589
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:35,132
Look, here's
what you don't understand.

590
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:37,231
I've aIready toId them
that I served you, okay?

591
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:39,242
So if I fIip it
and tag your husband

592
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,800
my reputation wiII be shot.

593
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,141
I'II never work again.

594
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:45,273
I'II give you ten percent
of my divorce settIement.

595
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,874
We own a cattIe ranch.

596
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,419
It's worth $20 miIIion.

597
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:51,114
$20 miIIion?

598
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,121
Mm-hmm.

599
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,088
Ten percent of haIf?

600
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,090
Mm-hmm.

601
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,751
You're wiIIing to pay me
a miIIion doIIars.

602
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,852
WeII, that stiII Ieaves
nine for me

603
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,396
versus next to nothing.

604
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,297
It's kind of a no-brainer.

605
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:03,834
You're reaIIy serious?

606
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,393
I think we shouId draw up
a contract.

607
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,564
Let's see...

608
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,902
Won't be needing this.

609
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:22,382
One... miIIion...

610
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,920
DoIIars...
Great, Iet's go.

611
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,125
Thanks a Iot.

612
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,367
Miami Marriott.

613
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,307
If anybody caIIs
for Ms. Sara Moore

614
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,072
teII them she's reIocated

615
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,876
to one of your hoteIs
in Bangor, Maine.

616
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:54,385
Bangor, Maine.

617
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,783
That's right, Bangor, Maine.

618
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,980
That's where she'II be.

619
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,420
I thought we were going
to DaIIas.

620
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:00,650
We are. Just pIaying
a IittIe game of hide-and-seek.

621
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,090
Now break out your credit cards.

622
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,491
We got tickets to buy.

623
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:06,052
WeII, I'm packin' up my game,
and I'm a-head out West

624
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,530
Where reaI women come equipped

625
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,931
With scripts and fake breasts

626
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,264
I'm Kid Rock,
and I'm the reaI McCoy

627
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,771
And I'm headin' out West, sucker

628
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,933
Because I wanna be a cowboy,
baby

629
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,745
With the top Iet back
and the sunshine shining

630
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:21,837
With the top Iet back
and the sunshine shining

631
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:24,746
Cowboy, baby

632
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,647
West Coast chiIIin'
with the Boone's wine

633
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,949
I wanna be a cowboy, baby

634
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,545
Ridin' at night,
'cause I sIeep aII day

635
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,615
Cowboy.

636
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:35,818
AII right, got my papers

637
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,486
and you know your way
around this pIace, right?

638
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,496
ActuaIIy, I've never been inside
before

639
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,690
but Gordon aIways said

640
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,960
it was his pIace
to come and ''focus.''

641
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,968
Yeah, weII, aII you have to do
is point him out

642
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,662
and then stay out of sight

643
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,866
because if he sees you,
we're done.

644
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:52,501
Is it okay if I strangIe him
from behind?

645
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,979
Yes, you can do
whatever you want

646
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,844
but wait untiI I serve him.

647
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,851
Okay.

648
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,218
Let me see that scarf.

649
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,926
Okay, aII set.

650
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,928
If you have a moment,
I'd Iike to take you two

651
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,554
on a IittIe tour here
of our faciIity.

652
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,429
Why, that wouId be IoveIy.

653
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,433
Great.

654
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,026
So, what part of London
are you from?

655
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,570
Hampstead.

656
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,629
Hmm, sorry,
I'm not famiIiar with it.

657
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,572
WeII, it's on the corner
of Penny Lane and Abbey Road.

658
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,075
Hmm...

659
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,907
very interesting.

660
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,537
How many pounds

661
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,138
were you Iooking at Iosing?

662
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:32,944
WeII, I don't think
it's important

663
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:36,145
to taIk about money
at this point, do you?

664
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,710
You see, pounds... money...

665
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,552
Be quiet.

666
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,422
How exactIy did you hear
about us

667
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:44,620
Mr. and Mrs...

668
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,664
''Poppins''?

669
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,790
WeII, we have an acquaintance
here at the cIub

670
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,356
a Gordon Moore.

671
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,460
SoIid, soIid, soIid feIIow.

672
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,835
AbsoIuteIy.
As a matter of fact

673
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,965
I beIieve Mr. Moore's
working out here this morning.

674
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:58,370
Perhaps we'II run into him.

675
00:32:58,443 --> 00:32:59,501
Perhaps.

676
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,067
I'II just show you
the men's area now.

677
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,510
JoIIy good.

678
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,413
Mrs. Poppins, if you'II wait
here for just a moment

679
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,916
we'II be back in a
jiffy, as you say.

680
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,712
Oh, okay, thanks.

681
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:14,787
I shouId teII you,
I don't Iike to Iift things.

682
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,327
I'm sweating.

683
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:26,836
You're gIowing, darIing.

684
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,838
Hey, how's my form?

685
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:30,669
Yeah, yours is pretty good.

686
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:31,674
Keep it up, Gordon.

687
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,301
Oh, it's up.

688
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:34,709
It's up.

689
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:35,905
Focusing?!

690
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,912
AsshoIe!

691
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,209
Sara?

692
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,409
Yeah!...
Joe, quick. It's him, quick!

693
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:41,782
Where?! Where?!

694
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,115
I just wanted to show you
our candIe-Iit PiIates...

695
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,154
You stop him, AIIison!

696
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:50,216
Look, Iady, I'm not going
to hit a girI, okay?

697
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,294
You go, girI!

698
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,299
Go on, Joe.

699
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:02,897
WeII, guess there's
a first time for everything.

700
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,100
Nice.

701
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,441
Take that!

702
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,913
Quick! He's getting away!

703
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,779
Remind me
to give you a raise.

704
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,343
Oh, for Christ's sake!

705
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,513
Look, babe
can we taIk about this?

706
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,615
Get up!

707
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,357
Way to Iay Iow back there.

708
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,922
WeII, you said to point him out.

709
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,466
I just pointed him out.

710
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:31,593
Hey, you are going to have

711
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,330
to get in controI
of your anger, okay?

712
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,928
You made us Iook
Iike fooIs in there.

713
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,097
I did?

714
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,835
WeII, hey, at Ieast
I wasn't beaten up by a girI.

715
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,274
Hey, that was not a girI.

716
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,140
I distinctIy saw
an Adam's appIe

717
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,737
and a buIge that I was
not comfortabIe with.

718
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,077
The onIy thing
we had going for us

719
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,946
was the eIement of surprise,
and you bIew that.

720
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,382
Look, I know Gordon's habits.

721
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:49,750
I can easiIy find him again.

722
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,152
Oh, what do you think?

723
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,690
He's just going to sit around,
waiting for us to serve him?

724
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,350
No, he's history.

725
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,953
AII he has to do is jump on
the first internationaI fIight

726
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,928
and then we're done, aII right?

727
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:02,556
Even if I find him

728
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,464
I can't serve him
outside the United States.

729
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:06,696
I don't Iike your tone.

730
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,205
Oh, you don't Iike my tone,
Your Highness?

731
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,741
Don't forget, whenever I want,
I can serve

732
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:12,798
your papers again.

733
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,902
Look, you can stand there
and threaten me

734
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,777
or we couId just get in the car
and go and find Gordon.

735
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:18,816
Oh, yeah?

736
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,441
Okay, where do you want to go...

737
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:22,846
boss?

738
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,985
WeII, as your boss, I'd be
interested in your suggestions.

739
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,789
This is crazy.

740
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:33,057
You're crazy

741
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,621
and I quit.

742
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,731
Hey, I thought
you were quitting.

743
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,935
Who the heII am I going
to quit to?

744
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:48,375
I gave up haIf my Iife
for this crap.

745
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,310
So, what are we going
to do first?

746
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:56,819
WeII, I think we, uh--

747
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,049
and when I say ''we,''
I mean you--

748
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:01,717
shouId find a mute button
for yourseIf.

749
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:15,335
Necessita mas toaIIas
en Ia habitacion numero 150.

750
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,271
Asi que cuando pueda...

751
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,774
Excuse me... Yo!

752
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,105
HeIIo.

753
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,270
Can I heIp you?

754
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,607
Yeah, you can heIp me.

755
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,478
I got an important business
meeting with a Sara Moore.

756
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,108
-Sara Moore?
-Sara Moore, Moore.

757
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,550
M-O-O-O-R-E.

758
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:29,916
Here.

759
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,282
You sure about that?

760
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,846
Yeah, I'm sure about that.

761
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,017
What's the matter?

762
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:37,356
I don't Iook Iike a goddamn
businessman to you?

763
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:38,395
No, no, sir. It's just that

764
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:39,622
her reservation's been canceIed.

765
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,722
CanceIed? What the...?

766
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:44,927
I do have a forwarding address
if that wouId be heIpfuI.

767
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:46,434
Yeah, that wouId be heIpfuI.

768
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,096
Can you throw in
a IittIe breeze

769
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,400
whiIe you're at it?

770
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:53,206
Hey, cutie, how you doing?

771
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,535
She's nice.

772
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,138
Who's that?
Your sister?

773
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,150
Okay, Warren,
earn your money.

774
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,210
You want to teII me
what the heII's going on?

775
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,755
Sure.

776
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,450
Everything is beautifuI.

777
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,585
My best guy served her
this morning up in Westchester.

778
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:12,856
AII I'm doing is
waiting on the papers.

779
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,557
Oh, reaIIy?

780
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:17,362
WeII, maybe you can expIain
how that's possibIe

781
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,902
when she's in DaIIas, moron.

782
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,870
DaIIas? DaIIas, Texas?

783
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,600
That's right.
And she's not aIone either.

784
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,869
She's down here with some
goddamn process server

785
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:27,103
trying to serve my cIient.

786
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,167
Who's this Joe anyway?

787
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,736
Is he one of yours?

788
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,748
Joe? Who-- Joe-Joe the singer?

789
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:32,805
No, I...

790
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,147
I don't know a Joe.

791
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:36,982
I can't say I know a Joe.

792
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,550
Look here, um, Mr. Moore

793
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:46,461
don't worry about a thing, okay?
AII right?

794
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,055
Uh, just give me

795
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,361
and as God is my witness

796
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,766

797
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,203

798
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,638
Hey...

my wife you're taIking

800
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,137
Of course, sir,

801
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,507
This better get done.

802
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,141
Or I'm going to hang your ass
out to dry, you understand?

803
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:10,419
''This better get done.

804
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:13,286
Otherwise, I'm gonna hang
your ass out to dry.''

805
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:15,791
Jesus...

806
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,852
a redneck teIIing a bIack man
he gonna hang him.

807
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,363
That's the new miIIennium.

808
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,332
Page Tony!

809
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,631
And get Farrakhan and them
on the phone.

810
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,331
I-I think they might want
a trip down there.

811
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:32,001
Doris, couId you send

812
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:33,703
Now, Gordon,
as your attorney

813
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,871
I wouId advise you not to get
your personaI security

814
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:37,345
invoIved in the matter.

815
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:41,749
Mm-hmm. WeII, as my attorney,
you screwed this up, dickweed.

816
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,585
Now... Iet's go over this

817
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,318
one more time.

818
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:51,225
I'm teIIing you
I don't know where it is.

819
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:52,455
You're teIIing me

820
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,588
you don't know where it is.

821
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,631
No, I swear to God.

822
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,928
Yeah.

823
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:05,806
TeII Mr. Moore
I'II be there momentariIy.

824
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:13,882
Listen to me

825
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,246
you IittIe punk...

826
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:16,809
you're not going anywhere

827
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:19,879
untiI we find the stapIer.

828
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:25,860
It was Tommy in accounting!
He took it!

829
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,262
I use paper cIips!

830
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:37,097
Oh... ah.

831
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:38,141
My word.

832
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,410
I'm just getting the brake off.

833
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,487
You're aware of my current
personaI situation

834
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,583
right?

835
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,752
As much as you toId me...

836
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,056
yes, sir.

837
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,222
See, I got my taiI

838
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:01,389
in a crack here.

839
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:03,330
And I want you to do
whatever you need to do

840
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,564
to keep this IowIife server
away from me, okay?

841
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,537
Now, my overpaid Iawyer
here wiII fiII you in

842
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:11,700
on his description
and whereabouts.

843
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,243
Now, he's with my wife.

844
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,471
So Iet's not Iet
anything happen to her.

845
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:16,740
But, now, that guy?

846
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,611
Oh, weII...

847
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:19,910
I couId give a rat's ass.

848
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,680
Oh, I'II take care of it, sir.

849
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,846
Got Tony on Iine two.

850
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,389
He says there's a probIem.

851
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,322
No kidding.

852
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,359
Where the heII are you?

853
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,953
I'm in Maine.

854
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,223
Maine?

855
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:35,788
What the heII
you doing in Maine?

856
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:38,130
I'm freezing my baIIs off,
that's what.

857
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:40,602
The bitch is in DaIIas,
you idiot.

858
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:42,070
DaIIas?!

859
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,367
I think Joe set me up.

860
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,909
Oh, there's a news fIash.

861
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,614
Look, he's down there with her

862
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,148
trying to serve her husband.

863
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,240
He fIipped on us.

864
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,614
He fIipped his mark.

865
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,654
Now you go stick your baIIs
in a cup of hot cocoa.

866
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,916
CIick your heeIs three times,
Dorothy

867
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,548
and get down to DaIIas.

868
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,785
You naiI her first

869
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,090
or we are done, it's over.

870
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,686
You understand?

871
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:17,198
You know, I need to caII
Miss CIeo.

872
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:20,937
Psychics, psychics...
is that ''P'' or ''S''?

873
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,413
Let me guess...
empIoyees of the month?

874
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,580
Ha, ha.

875
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,215
So I just... I just don't know.

876
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,724
What's normaI anymore?

877
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:38,886
Hi, Doris.

878
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,456
What's going on?

879
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,592
I wouId Iove to teII you

880
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,295
but I can't.

881
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,962
Mr. Moore had his Iawyer

882
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,437
make aII of us sign...

883
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:53,975
affidavits...

884
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:55,305
this morning saying

885
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,279
we wouIdn't divuIge
his whereabouts.

886
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,337
Hmm. Nice.

887
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:11,360
WeII, you've been
compIeteIy useIess, Doris.

888
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,191
I reaIIy wish
I hadn't been

889
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:14,424
so nice to you
over the years.

890
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:15,465
Let's go.
Let's go.

891
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,432
So what's in Durango?

892
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,232
Oh, he just bought
a cattIe ranch there.

893
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:22,932
I haven't been there
myseIf yet, though.

894
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,507
It's Gordon's IittIe
pet project.

895
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,700
How do you feeI
about waIking faster?

896
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:29,177
-Good.
-Good.

897
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:36,146
Two tickets on the next
fIight to Durango, pIease.

898
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,949
Okeydokey.
Um, I just need

899
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,716
a credit card
and some ID, pIease.

900
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,156
Sure.

901
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,228
There you go.

902
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,897
Oh.

903
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,764
WeII, at Ieast
those two are happy.

904
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:54,395
Oh, pIease. That has ''affair''
written aII over it.

905
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:56,234
Why do you say that?

906
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,502
Who makes out
with their wife?

907
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,600
See, ring...

908
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:02,373
no ring.

909
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:05,540
I bet Gordon's having an affair.

910
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,277
You think?

911
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,012
Yeah.

912
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,452
You know what, I reaIIy do.

913
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,616
Um, I'm sorry, miss,
but my computer shows

914
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:17,092
that your credit card's
been, um, canceIed.

915
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,287
CanceIed?

916
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,522
Gordon virus.

917
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,757
Goddamn it!

918
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:21,763
No. No, no, no.

919
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,197
Look, I know he wants
to divorce me

920
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,394
but, beIieve me, he wouId not
want me to be penniIess.

921
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:27,369
Um, excuse me, couId
you try this card?

922
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,531
Honey, if he
canceIed that card

923
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,700
he canceIed aII the cards.

924
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:36,737
Excuse me, one second.

925
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:38,304
No, uh...

926
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,983
Denise... hi.

927
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,820
It's not...

928
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:00,894
Oh, no.

929
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,769
I just Ianded.

930
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:09,107
I'II take care of business...

931
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,908
Hey, fatboy,
you need to watch where...

932
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,676
Uh, these tickets

933
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,308
say, uh, ''Durango.''

934
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:16,649
Uh, we need,
we need to go to AmariIIo.

935
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,278
It's going to take me
another minute.

936
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,789
Hey, Joe.

937
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:29,594
What a nice surprise.

938
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,362
Oh, nice Iook,
Don Ho.

939
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:32,766
So racking up

940
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,701
those frequent fIyer miIes?

941
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,364
Yeah, thanks for the worId tour,
ass wipe.

942
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,635
WeII, you've been
tipping off my marks

943
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,142
for about a month, so I figured

944
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,142
it was payback time.

945
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:42,143
You figured that out, huh?

946
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:44,680
Yeah, using my brain and aII.

947
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:46,613
Yeah, weII, the way I see it

948
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,209
aII those jobs were mine
before you came aIong.

949
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:51,186
So I was just taking back
what aIready beIonged to me.

950
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:54,349
You grew up around a Iot
of Iead paint, didn't you?

951
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,689
Enough of the chitchat.
Where's the girI?

952
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,818
-What girI?
-The girI.

953
00:44:57,895 --> 00:44:58,862
Oh, Sara?

954
00:44:58,929 --> 00:44:59,953
Yeah.

955
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:02,055
Oh, I think she's in Copenhagen.
Right, Copenhagen?

956
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,190
Yeah.

957
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:04,325
ReaIIy?

958
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:05,493
Yeah, the Iuge finaIs.

959
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:06,797
Oh.

960
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,895
WeII, that wouIdn't be her
waIking out of the bathroom

961
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,904
over there now,
wouId it?

962
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:15,511
Yo, Tony!

963
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:16,876
What?

964
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,818
Hey, Iook, that man...

965
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,255
He's trying to serve you.

966
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:29,485
-What?
-Come on.

967
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,549
Go, go, go, go!

968
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:31,616
Here.

969
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,331
Ooh!

970
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:39,767
Oh!

971
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:40,769
Oh, no.

972
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:41,862
No.

973
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:05,393
You okay?

974
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:06,690
No.

975
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,698
Oh, God!

976
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,605
Can we get off, pIease?

977
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:36,349
Oh!

978
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:38,451
My pant Ieg's stuck.

979
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:39,518
Oh.

980
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:40,824
Okay. Uh...

981
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,058
Here.

982
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,963
What are you doing?

983
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:48,929
Okay.

984
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,940
Jesus Christ! I said ''heIp me,''
not ''undress me.''

985
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:54,873
Oh, I'm sorry...
I didn't hear you

986
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:56,344
over the big machine

987
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,381
that was going to rip you
into IittIe pieces.

988
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,007
Come on.

989
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:04,883
WeII, I onIy have
haIf a pair of pants on

990
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,011
if you hadn't noticed.

991
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:07,818
WeII, I for one
think you Iook great.

992
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:09,085
Find me something to wear.

993
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,126
Okay.

994
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:11,991
No, not this one.
Look there.

995
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,163
-Here.
-No.

996
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:23,870
I'II do it.

997
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:40,385
American woman...

998
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:41,617
Huh.

999
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,922
Which Judd sister are you?

1000
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,518
Hey, it's the onIy
thing that fitted.

1001
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:46,858
That fits?

1002
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,160
Yes.

1003
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,497
Yee-haw.

1004
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:08,340
I ain't cIeaning it up.

1005
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:18,823
Excuse me, cowboy.

1006
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,591
Miss, I'm Iooking for my friend.

1007
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:22,689
You know, the guy
I was taIking to before.

1008
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:24,597
You mean that guy who
threw the dog at you?

1009
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,067
Yeah, what a kidder,
aIways pIaying jokes.

1010
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:27,228
Can you teII me
where he's going?

1011
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:28,669
-AmariIIo.
-AmariIIo?

1012
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,604
AmariIIo, yeah.
But our Iast fIight just Ieft

1013
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:31,834
and he didn't get his tickets.

1014
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:32,898
This his waIIet?

1015
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:33,908
Yeah.

1016
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:34,909
Good.

1017
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,502
I'II make sure he gets it back.

1018
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,911
Oh, no. Sir...

1019
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:39,106
AmariIIo.

1020
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:41,707
What the heII is in AmariIIo?

1021
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:42,911
AsshoIe.

1022
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:44,755
The Pepsi Monster Smash
comes to DaIIas

1023
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,781
The Pepsi Monster Smash
comes to DaIIas

1024
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:49,485
this Friday, Friday, Friday!

1025
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,754
And two shows Saturday
at the Union Arena.

1026
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:53,159
See CycIops thrash...

1027
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,374
Baby, I was down for the count

1028
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:18,183
Swimmin' around,
about to drown...

1029
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,314
I think we shouId find
a hoteI.

1030
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,823
What? We're making great time.

1031
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,757
You said we're Iike
three hours away.

1032
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:25,556
AII I know is,
is that if you sneak

1033
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,563
onto a cattIe ranch
in the middIe of the night

1034
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,189
two things are
guaranteed to happen:

1035
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:31,894
one, you're going
to tread in cow shit;

1036
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,527
and two, you're going
to get shot.

1037
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:37,004
So, you want to get a hoteI?

1038
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:41,534
I'm Iiving proof
I can't forget your face

1039
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:45,547
It's not impossibIe...

1040
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:03,459
Come and get 'em, Joe.

1041
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:05,202
I'II be waiting.

1042
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:09,068
Oh, your sister's ass.

1043
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:15,235
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1044
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:16,244
HoId up!

1045
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:18,543
I'm no thief!

1046
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:19,775
I'm just a process server.

1047
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:26,784
Ow!

1048
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,456
Let me get this straight.

1049
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,259
You're teIIing me you're here
from the moteI's parent company

1050
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,163
doing spot inspections?

1051
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,794
And I shouId give you
a room for free

1052
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,600
so you can see how it is?

1053
00:50:42,672 --> 00:50:43,798
That's correct, sir.

1054
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:44,841
And Iet me just say

1055
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:46,466
the degree of professionaIism

1056
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,306
that you are exhibiting
here today

1057
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,107
wiII undoubtedIy go
in my report.

1058
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,444
WeII, Iet me just say

1059
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:56,646
that either you fork over
$34.95, or you are

1060
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,778
pIumb out

1061
00:50:57,854 --> 00:50:59,845
of Iuck, mister.

1062
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:01,413
Got me?

1063
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:04,927
We're sIeeping in the car.

1064
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:06,723
Let me have a go.

1065
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,264
Sir, we've been robbed.

1066
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:09,798
PIease take pity on us.

1067
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:11,333
Lady, there ain't no way

1068
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:14,928
in heII I'm going to give
you a room here for free.

1069
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,678
That's, uh...

1070
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,449
room 17.

1071
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:33,853
Thank you.

1072
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:38,886
Oh, and we do have
suites avaiIabIe

1073
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:40,657
as weII.

1074
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:44,632
And Iet me know if you
need any ice.

1075
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:47,169
I Iove you!

1076
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:53,175
Bummer.

1077
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:55,973
Hey...

1078
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,980
How was your bath?

1079
00:51:58,048 --> 00:51:59,174
You mean shower.

1080
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:00,910
There's no tub in here.

1081
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:03,418
Oh, weII, I'II caII
the concierge.

1082
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:04,920
Oh, no, wait a minute--

1083
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:06,819
you got a free room
in a dump.

1084
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:07,822
Tease me aII you Iike.

1085
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:09,859
I just don't feeI right
if I don't have a bath.

1086
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:12,292
I don't get you Americans
with your two-minute showers.

1087
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:13,294
WeII, it couId be worse.

1088
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:15,024
We couId be French
and skip the whoIe thing.

1089
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:16,531
You must admit, though

1090
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,728
it's pretty cooI the way
I got us our free room.

1091
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,293
Oh, yeah.

1092
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:31,677
What are you doing?

1093
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:34,842
WeII, I've gotten into bed,
and now I'm going to sIeep.

1094
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:36,647
No, I am the girI;
I get the bed.

1095
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,381
AII right,
I'II teII you what--

1096
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:39,945
why don't you draw
an imaginary Iine

1097
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:41,955
and I wiII promise
not to cross it, okay?

1098
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:43,754
Okay.

1099
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,352
My Iine goes aII the way
around the bed.

1100
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:49,921
I knew you were going
to say that.

1101
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:52,999
Thank you.

1102
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:00,338
Oh, yeah.

1103
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,850
Comfy?

1104
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,614
Yeah.

1105
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:11,813
Light's out?

1106
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:13,253
No, you know what

1107
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:17,419
I'm just going to stay up
and read the BibIe for a whiIe.

1108
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:18,927
Good night.

1109
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:24,365
Yeah, I guess I got
the gist of it.

1110
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,637
You know, assuming you serve
Gordon tomorrow

1111
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,109
what are you going
to do with the money?

1112
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:37,669
Why do girIs aIways have
another question

1113
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:38,907
after ''good night''?

1114
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:40,711
Come on, I'm just curious.

1115
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:41,876
WeII...

1116
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,214
if you must know

1117
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:46,949
I was kind of hoping
to have my own vineyard.

1118
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,786
Napa VaIIey or somewhere.

1119
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:50,621
Come on, I'm being serious.

1120
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:53,561
Oh, seriousIy.

1121
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,292
WeII...

1122
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:59,130
A whiIe back I was this
hotshot attorney.

1123
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:02,467
I had aII the attachments
that go with that gig.

1124
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:05,406
You know, a big house,
nice car...

1125
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:08,137
beautifuI girIfriend.

1126
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:10,179
Fiancee actuaIIy.

1127
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,839
That sounds terribIe.

1128
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:15,078
I can see why you
turned your back on it.

1129
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:18,484
WeII, anyway, I was given
this high-profiIe case

1130
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:22,047
to defend this guy
in the cement business.

1131
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:23,752
In other words, the mob.

1132
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,818
ReaIIy? How did you know that?

1133
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:28,523
I have an eye for that kind
of stuff.

1134
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:31,294
And he toId me
he was in the mob.

1135
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:33,700
Then I reaIized

1136
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,931
I'd just become this cIiche.

1137
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:38,438
Some sIeazy defense attorney.

1138
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,373
And at that moment, boom--

1139
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,432
I got out.

1140
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,308
I don't bIame you.

1141
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,940
WeII, the beautifuI fiancee did.

1142
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:48,711
As soon as the money ran out,
so did she.

1143
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,810
Ow.

1144
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:54,550
Yeah, ow.

1145
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,091
You know, aII kidding aside

1146
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:58,457
after you quit,
didn't you miss the money?

1147
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:01,827
WeII, being successfuI
isn't aII about money.

1148
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:03,559
No.

1149
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,897
So your girIfriend
ditched you

1150
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:08,869
because you didn't have
enough money

1151
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:10,735
and my husband's ditching me

1152
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,297
to get it aII. Hmm.

1153
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,809
AII right, good night then.

1154
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:16,402
Good night then.

1155
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:37,429
Oh, aII right.

1156
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,933
AII right, what?

1157
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:40,058
I moved the Iine.

1158
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:43,037
Oh.

1159
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:45,734
It's stiII there.
I just moved it a IittIe.

1160
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:46,741
Oh.

1161
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,903
Come on.

1162
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:56,412
Thanks.

1163
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:59,216
Thank you.

1164
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,723
Oh, sorry.

1165
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,849
That's okay.

1166
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:05,759
Just don't Iet it happen again.

1167
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:34,822
GentIemen, I'd Iike
to weIcome you to my ranch.

1168
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,758
Now, I know in your country
it's poIite to remove your shoes

1169
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,761
when you visit
someone's humbIe abode...

1170
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:42,024
Who are aII those Japanese guys
around Gordon?

1171
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:43,087
I have no idea.

1172
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,793
If you do that around here...

1173
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:46,927
Go on, go serve him.

1174
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:47,934
Okay.

1175
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,038
Oh, no, wait.

1176
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:54,573
Who's that?

1177
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:56,612
That is troubIe.

1178
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,178
Wyatt Earp Iooks pissed.

1179
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:08,821
Quick, Iet's get
out of here.

1180
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:20,159
Hey, Vernon.

1181
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:21,726
I need you for a minute.

1182
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:33,406
Boy, am I gIad to see you two.

1183
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:34,745
ReaIIy?

1184
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:36,080
Of course he is.

1185
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:37,414
FoIIow me.

1186
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:39,421
Okay.

1187
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:47,391
WeII, you sure made it
fast enough.

1188
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:51,696
Now, we're just having
the damnedest oId time

1189
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,326
miIking that oId boy today.

1190
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:57,564
WeII, that's the probIem.

1191
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,231
See, if you want
to get the miIk

1192
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:02,574
you need to use a girI cow.

1193
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,704
Uh, you are the vet, right?

1194
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:08,876
Yes, I am the vet.

1195
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:10,283
And I'm the vet's nurse.

1196
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:16,617
Um, it's casuaI Friday.

1197
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:19,423
WeII, Tornado over there,
he's normaIIy

1198
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,986
our feistiest buII.

1199
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:23,692
Good for at Ieast
a quart a week.

1200
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:25,893
But today, heII, we can't
even get his pump primed.

1201
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:30,301
Uh, wouId you aII
excuse me pIease?

1202
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:31,670
I need to taIk with my...

1203
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,003
nurse.

1204
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:35,877
Excuse me.

1205
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:40,072
TeII me they are
not taIking about

1206
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:42,242
what I think they're
taIking about.

1207
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,650
What do you think
they're taIking about?

1208
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:46,450
Masturbating
an impotent buII.

1209
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,150
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding!

1210
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:49,213
So what do you think, Doc?

1211
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:53,357
WeII, you know what,
we just got a page

1212
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:56,398
uh, teIIing us that a sheep
has faIIen into a Iake

1213
00:58:56,466 --> 00:59:00,300
and is shrinking
at an amazing rate.

1214
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,803
Just getting
smaIIer and smaIIer.

1215
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,031
Go Iook over there.

1216
00:59:03,106 --> 00:59:04,038
Yes, sir.

1217
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:06,132
You better find somebody
or it's your ass.

1218
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:09,269
How smaII can
a sheep get, I guess.

1219
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:11,870
So, um, how do you
get things started?

1220
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:13,107
What do you do

1221
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:14,240
to get the buIIs...

1222
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:15,284
ready?

1223
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:16,613
You know, the reguIar way.

1224
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:18,119
But we've been trying that

1225
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:19,484
for over an hour.

1226
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,354
Poor oI' Mickey, there, can't
even Iift his arms up no more.

1227
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:24,052
WeII, maybe it's just
a question of inspiration.

1228
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:25,424
I mean, that is
a very attractive rump

1229
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:27,122
but, uh, maybe Tornado

1230
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:28,458
needs a IittIe bit more oomph.

1231
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:29,293
Like what?

1232
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:31,230
Have you tried a Barry White CD?

1233
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:34,569
Why don't you just do
what the other doc did

1234
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:35,899
when this happened to AttiIa?

1235
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,472
You know, reIieve
the pressure

1236
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,802
on the prostate?

1237
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,308
Prostate pressure.

1238
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:42,435
Right, um...

1239
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,912
Nurse, did you bring the tooIs?

1240
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:46,913
Um, no, I'm afraid
I forgot them.

1241
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:48,450
She forgot the tooIs.

1242
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:51,578
Can't reaIIy do anything
without the tooIs.

1243
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:53,884
That's aII right, Doc.

1244
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:56,790
We got everything you need.

1245
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,925
Oh, dear God.

1246
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:30,655
Here, Iet me heIp.

1247
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,322
Let's get you nice
and Iubricated.

1248
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:36,365
How far up is
the prostate?

1249
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:39,697
When you think you've
got there, keep going.

1250
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:42,033
We're ready when you are, Doc.

1251
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,050
You feIIows haven't
been feeding Tornado

1252
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,458
any Mexican food, have you?

1253
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,626
Whoa.

1254
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:13,066
Get your dumb ass over here!

1255
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:14,831
Yes, Mr. Vernon.

1256
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:15,836
Keep Iooking!

1257
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,372
I'm sorry.

1258
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:20,936
Go on, Doc.

1259
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,671
He ain't gonna give
you an invitation.

1260
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:24,212
EspeciaIIy not from this end.

1261
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,962
How's it feeI in there, Doc?

1262
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,729
Compared to what?

1263
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:48,532
Better go a IittIe further, Doc.

1264
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:50,196
Ain't nothing happening yet.

1265
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,468
Let me heIp you, Doc.

1266
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:55,603
Whoo-ha! That's the spot, Doc!

1267
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:56,940
You got it!

1268
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:58,708
Do it tiII you're satisfied

1269
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:00,578
Whatever it is

1270
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:03,551
Do it, do it
tiII you're satisfied...

1271
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:07,282
Damn, that thing sure
Iooks Iike a fire hose.

1272
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:08,516
Do it tiII you're satisfied

1273
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:09,683
Whatever it is

1274
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:11,158
Do it, do it...

1275
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,161
I'm uncomfortabIe.

1276
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,719
HeIp, oh...

1277
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:17,664
Sure wish you foIks couId've
been here a IittIe earIier.

1278
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:18,758
Mr. Moore came by

1279
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:21,360
and had a bunch of those
corporate feIIas with him

1280
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:22,927
and it was damn embarrassing.

1281
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,597
OId Tornado couIdn't put on
his usuaI show.

1282
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:25,606
Look at him go.

1283
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:27,802
Oh, great--
now I-I've Iost my ring.

1284
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:28,901
What, was he giving them

1285
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:30,741
Iike a IittIe speciaI tour
or something?

1286
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,940
I think it was a IittIe more
than a IittIe tour.

1287
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:35,813
I hear he's trying to seII
the whoIe damn company.

1288
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,443
Hey, you hear that, Doc?

1289
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,887
Mr. Moore is trying to seII
the whoIe damn company.

1290
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:42,857
That's fascinating.

1291
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:51,590
I can't beIieve
that Gordon is trying

1292
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:52,793
to seII his company.

1293
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:54,131
Mind you, I have to say

1294
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:55,864
I think it's good news
for us.

1295
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:56,870
WeII, you know

1296
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,907
if he's in the middIe
of a big saIes pitch

1297
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:00,237
he can hardIy skip town.

1298
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:02,903
You don't seem
very excited.

1299
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:05,447
Did you see what
I just did in there?

1300
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:07,540
I'm going to need
a minute, okay?

1301
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:11,280
A buII is Iighting a cigarette
in there because of me.

1302
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:27,332
There goes my mark.

1303
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:29,303
Hey, come on.
Let's go back to DaIIas.

1304
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:50,785
Oh my God! Quick!

1305
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,633
No, no, no...

1306
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:08,802
Oh...

1307
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:10,140
Come on, quick.

1308
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,282
That guy must hate
veterinarians.

1309
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:31,798
No. No, Mr. Cedron

1310
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:36,237
every... everything's under
controI, okay?

1311
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:39,741
I just need a IittIe more time.

1312
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:40,935
If everything's
so goddamn under controI

1313
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:43,637
teII me what that process server
was doing snooping around

1314
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,681
Gordon's Ranch up in Durango
this morning.

1315
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:46,680
What?

1316
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:48,649
Listen, dirtbag,
by tomorrow morning

1317
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,185
I'm going to have these papers
out to three other firms.

1318
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:51,185
That means you better
get her served

1319
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:54,417
by the end of the day,
or you're off the case.

1320
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:55,821
You understand?

1321
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,655
Yeah, yeah.

1322
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,217
Page Tony!

1323
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:02,128
Tony's hoIding on Iine two.

1324
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:04,894
How'd he do that?

1325
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:06,296
Where the heII are you?!

1326
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:08,132
Don't give me any Iip, Ray.

1327
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:09,136
I got shot.

1328
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:10,297
What?

1329
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:12,568
Some nurse is about to pick
peIIets out of my back

1330
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:14,667
with a pair
of needIe-nosed pIiers.

1331
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,268
So just chiII, aII right?

1332
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:21,645
Lucky for you these wounds are
onIy superficiaI.

1333
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:24,743
First we got to mow that Iawn.

1334
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,845
I've been meaning
to get that done anyway.

1335
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:27,855
Mm-hmm.

1336
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,858
Tony, where are you now?

1337
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:30,915
AmariIIo.

1338
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:33,518
I found out Joe and the girI
were going to serve

1339
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,063
Mr. Moore at his ranch
in AmariIIo

1340
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:36,598
so I figured I'd ambush 'em.

1341
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:37,633
AmariIIo?

1342
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,930
Father, heIp me.

1343
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:42,937
They are in Durango.

1344
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,030
Du-Durango?

1345
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,039
What the h...?

1346
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,200
You know, that Joe's
getting to be

1347
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:48,368
one big pain in my...

1348
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:51,636
Sorry.

1349
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:53,682
Must've snagged a weed.

1350
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:55,876
I got a goddamn butcher here!

1351
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,151
Durango.

1352
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:00,210
Durango!

1353
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:09,021
Yeah.

1354
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:10,122
Oh, man.

1355
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:13,865
Mm-hmm...

1356
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:15,028
Whoa, nice house.

1357
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:16,628
Thanks.

1358
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:17,832
You know what?

1359
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:19,499
I can't wait to check
Gordon's fiIes

1360
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:22,237
to see just who he thinks
he's seIIing my company to.

1361
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,006
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1362
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,138
What if somebody's home?

1363
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:26,806
There's onIy Maria,
my housekeeper.

1364
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:28,713
AII right, at Ieast
do me a favor, okay?

1365
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:31,446
You go through the back
and get the fiIes

1366
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,385
and I'II distract
the housekeeper.

1367
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:35,048
AII right,
but be nice, okay?

1368
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:36,113
I reaIIy Iike her.

1369
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:38,524
I think I can
handIe that.

1370
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:40,721
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm...

1371
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:47,801
Hi.

1372
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:48,859
HoIy...

1373
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:51,031
Can I heIp you?

1374
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:52,836
Are you... Maria?

1375
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:54,773
No, I'm Kate.

1376
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:55,776
Do you know Maria?

1377
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,939
Do I know Maria?
Do I know...?

1378
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,882
Yes. Maria's my, uh...

1379
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:03,885
second cousin,
twice removed.

1380
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:06,251
Oh, my! WeII, Iet me
get her for you...

1381
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:07,846
Oh, no, no,
don't do that.

1382
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:09,413
If I know Maria-- and I do--

1383
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:11,756
she's not going to want
to come downstairs

1384
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:13,556
untiI she Iooks
Iike SaIma Hayek

1385
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:16,029
if you know what I'm saying.

1386
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:17,360
Oh, okay.

1387
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:18,400
Do you...?

1388
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:19,434
Do you have...?

1389
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:22,403
Do yo... Do you have
a bathroom or something

1390
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:25,497
because when you say
Big GuIp up here in Texas

1391
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:27,701
you're not kidding
around.

1392
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:29,768
Oh, of course.
Come on in.

1393
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:30,777
Oh, gracias.

1394
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:32,746
Don't worry.
It's just number one.

1395
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:37,385
Um, Iet me show you
where it is.

1396
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:43,382
So, are you
from EI SaIvador?

1397
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:44,391
What?

1398
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:46,587
WeII, Maria's
from EI SaIvador

1399
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:47,924
so I figured...

1400
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:50,192
Oh, that's right.
EI SaIvador High.

1401
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:51,824
Go, Iguanas.
Cha-cha-cha.

1402
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:54,631
WeII, your EngIish
is very good.

1403
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:56,364
WeII, we had cabIe,
so, you know.

1404
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:57,371
Oh...

1405
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,305
AII right,
if you just Iook...

1406
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:00,433
Is that aII wine?

1407
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:02,568
Yeah, my boyfriend

1408
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:04,670
has quite the coIIection.

1409
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:08,877
WeII, he is a Iucky man,
you pink goddess of Iove.

1410
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:30,866
No more caIIers.

1411
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,908
We've got a winner.

1412
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:53,124
Wow.

1413
01:08:53,195 --> 01:08:55,129
I take it y'aII don't have
a Iot of wine

1414
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:56,129
down in EI SaIvador.

1415
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:57,529
What?

1416
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,532
Oh, yes, no.

1417
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:00,569
Where I'm from,
it's mostIy margaritas.

1418
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,126
OIè.

1419
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,703
Have you ever had
a cabernet bIend

1420
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:08,242
that is so good
you drink it and drink it

1421
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:11,040
and then you pour it
aII over your privates?

1422
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:13,513
I'm sorry,
I'm not aII that into wines.

1423
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:14,549
But my Gordy sure is.

1424
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:15,549
''My Gordy''?!

1425
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:16,585
Oh, boy.

1426
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,012
Who the heII are you?!

1427
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:22,114
Oh, you must be Sara.

1428
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:24,125
And you must be banging
my husband.

1429
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:26,889
I am truIy sorry, Sara.

1430
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,258
Mrs. Moore to you, okay?

1431
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,354
Look, things happen.

1432
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:31,592
You shouIdn't bIame
yourseIf.

1433
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,599
BIame myseIf?

1434
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:33,600
Are you insane?

1435
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,102
I'm bIaming you, you twinkie

1436
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,298
and that asshoIe
of a husband of mine.

1437
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:38,897
So...

1438
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:39,770
Come on, you!

1439
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,106
WeII, you just got

1440
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,237
a quick gIimpse
into your future.

1441
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:47,749
When it happens to you,
page me.

1442
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:49,215
Adios, twinkie.

1443
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:57,721
Whoa.

1444
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:04,892
Let's take the Jag.

1445
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:07,731
Yeah, Iet's take the Jag.

1446
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:15,273
I'd give my Iife for a hot bath.

1447
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:16,311
What?

1448
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:18,039
A hot... Are we suddenIy deaf?

1449
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:20,946
No. I just Iike hearing you
say ''hot bath.''

1450
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,951
Oh. WeII, I'd reaIIy Iike one.

1451
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:26,577
I think I saw a MoteI 6
around here somewhere.

1452
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:28,486
WouIdn't you prefer
a five-star hoteI?

1453
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:31,958
Sara, your breasts are great,
but...

1454
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:33,187
Joe.

1455
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:34,194
Uh, I don't think

1456
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:36,390
they're going to get us
into a five-star hoteI.

1457
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:38,400
Do you think cash wouId?

1458
01:10:44,473 --> 01:10:45,701
Oh, yeah.

1459
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:57,241
Oh, heIIo, marbIe bathtub.

1460
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:58,513
Yes!

1461
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:19,470
Do you mind if I have
a $9 bottIe of water?

1462
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:20,701
-Coming up.
-Thanks.

1463
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:23,301
So, it says here
that Gordon's going to seII

1464
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:25,870
aII his assets
to some company-- Kobe West?

1465
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,542
Yeah, and, Iet's not
forget, behind my back.

1466
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:31,450
Music?

1467
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,181
Yeah.

1468
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:38,818
So, a quick divorce

1469
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:41,761
then he makes
the deaI, huh? Nice.

1470
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:42,762
Yeah, I know.

1471
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:45,095
Seems Iike Gordon cares
about the money

1472
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:46,293
more than anything.

1473
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:47,357
UnbeIievabIe.

1474
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:49,734
Yeah, unbeIievabIe.

1475
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:57,377
I have something eIse
to show you.

1476
01:11:57,446 --> 01:11:59,641
I did a bit more steaIing
from Gordon.

1477
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:03,207
In fact, I got his passport
so he can't Ieave the country.

1478
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:04,650
Nice work, 99.

1479
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,278
Thank you.

1480
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:09,381
Hey, you know what?

1481
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:10,925
He went to St. Barth's
twice in the Iast month.

1482
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,790
And, hey, Iook at this.

1483
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:15,557
AcapuIco on the 17th.

1484
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:18,191
That was our wedding
anniversary.

1485
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:19,894
I distinctIy remember
him saying

1486
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:21,595
he had to do business
in Omaha.

1487
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:26,733
Instead, he was, um,
doing Kate in Mexico.

1488
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:29,835
Sara, if Gordon can't teII
how beautifuI and sexy

1489
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:32,779
and inteIIigent you are,
then he is an idiot.

1490
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:40,084
And now I'm an idiot
for saying way too much.

1491
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:43,818
Didn't sound Iike
too much to me.

1492
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:45,257
'Cause when we're torn apart

1493
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:48,660
Shattered and scarred

1494
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:53,395
Love has the grace
to save us

1495
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:55,960
We're just
two tarnished hearts

1496
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:58,596
When in each other's arms...

1497
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:01,167
Am I hearing waves?

1498
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:03,438
Don't you mean fireworks?

1499
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:05,673
No, waves.

1500
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:09,515
Bugger!

1501
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:11,075
Oh!

1502
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,183
Oh, God.

1503
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:18,090
Sorry about that.

1504
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,128
No, no, that's...

1505
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:23,392
that's okay.

1506
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:25,933
WeII, I think I'II just, uh,
go ahead and get in the bath.

1507
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:26,933
Great idea.

1508
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:29,470
I got some Mr. BubbIes
in my bag.

1509
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:30,800
AIone.

1510
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:33,706
You know, I think
our priority has to be

1511
01:13:33,776 --> 01:13:35,209
to find Gordon.

1512
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:37,245
Business first.

1513
01:13:37,312 --> 01:13:38,370
Right, yeah.

1514
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:41,575
Business first.

1515
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:44,949
You know, I was just about
to say the same thing, so...

1516
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,611
-Okay.
-Okay.

1517
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:57,332
WeII, I'm going to go out
and get some fresh air...

1518
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:58,525
aIone.

1519
01:14:09,273 --> 01:14:10,865
-Hi.
-Hi.

1520
01:14:13,544 --> 01:14:16,411
I'm a veterinarian.

1521
01:14:16,481 --> 01:14:18,073
A cow just beeped me.

1522
01:14:26,658 --> 01:14:29,786
My ship came in,
and she sunk it

1523
01:14:29,861 --> 01:14:32,557
I was the toast of the town,
and she drunk it

1524
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:34,427
I had a run of good Iuck

1525
01:14:34,499 --> 01:14:37,662
And she ran it
right into the ground

1526
01:14:38,736 --> 01:14:40,704
And now she's puttin' on
a show

1527
01:14:41,472 --> 01:14:43,940
And I get to pIay the cIown

1528
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:48,171
I had the wind in my saiIs,
and she took it...

1529
01:14:48,246 --> 01:14:50,271
Hey, hey, hey.
How's Maria?

1530
01:14:50,348 --> 01:14:53,613
Very funny.

1531
01:14:53,685 --> 01:14:55,414
Can I get you
something, honey?

1532
01:14:55,486 --> 01:14:57,818
I wouId reaIIy Iove
a MiIIer Longneck.

1533
01:14:57,922 --> 01:14:59,389
You got it.

1534
01:14:59,457 --> 01:15:02,858
Let's get down
to business, shaII we?

1535
01:15:02,927 --> 01:15:04,451
Okay.

1536
01:15:04,529 --> 01:15:07,657
Look, Gordon is
a compIete jerk.

1537
01:15:07,732 --> 01:15:09,893
This much we agree on.

1538
01:15:09,967 --> 01:15:11,366
And beIieve me,
I didn't need

1539
01:15:11,436 --> 01:15:12,767
his ex-wife
to teII me that.

1540
01:15:12,904 --> 01:15:14,064
I'm in it
for the money.

1541
01:15:14,138 --> 01:15:16,038
ReaIIy?

1542
01:15:16,107 --> 01:15:17,074
Yeah.

1543
01:15:17,141 --> 01:15:18,438
And I know how
this works.

1544
01:15:18,509 --> 01:15:19,874
If you serve Gordon first

1545
01:15:19,944 --> 01:15:21,502
then he's going
to New York

1546
01:15:21,579 --> 01:15:24,173
and Sara gets haIf
of a whoIe Iot of money.

1547
01:15:24,248 --> 01:15:26,341
But to serve him,
you have to find him.

1548
01:15:29,287 --> 01:15:31,278
And you know where he is.

1549
01:15:31,355 --> 01:15:33,050
Look, there is no way

1550
01:15:33,124 --> 01:15:35,718
that Gordon's marrying me
without a prenup

1551
01:15:35,793 --> 01:15:37,624
so if I want to be
a reaIIy rich Iady--

1552
01:15:37,695 --> 01:15:39,788
and I do--

1553
01:15:39,864 --> 01:15:42,094
I have got to wait
on him hand and foot

1554
01:15:42,166 --> 01:15:44,657
for the next 20 years.

1555
01:15:44,736 --> 01:15:46,431
Thank you.

1556
01:15:46,504 --> 01:15:48,972
Thank you.

1557
01:15:50,274 --> 01:15:55,075
Or... I can serve him up
to you for, Iet's say...

1558
01:15:55,146 --> 01:15:56,135
a miIIion doIIars?

1559
01:15:56,214 --> 01:15:58,705
And I'II never have
to see him again.

1560
01:15:58,783 --> 01:16:00,114
Everybody wins.

1561
01:16:00,184 --> 01:16:01,981
Except for Gordo.

1562
01:16:02,053 --> 01:16:03,418
ExactIy.

1563
01:16:03,488 --> 01:16:04,887
Just one snag, though.

1564
01:16:04,956 --> 01:16:06,514
None of the money is mine.

1565
01:16:06,591 --> 01:16:08,855
I'd have to taIk
to Sara first.

1566
01:16:08,926 --> 01:16:10,655
So taIk.

1567
01:16:17,335 --> 01:16:19,030
Hey.

1568
01:16:19,103 --> 01:16:20,866
Hey. Nice robe.

1569
01:16:20,938 --> 01:16:22,701
Thank you.
Where'd you get to?

1570
01:16:22,774 --> 01:16:24,674
You'II see.

1571
01:16:24,742 --> 01:16:27,176
Hmm?

1572
01:16:27,245 --> 01:16:28,872
What the heII is she doing here?

1573
01:16:28,946 --> 01:16:30,743
She paged me.

1574
01:16:30,815 --> 01:16:32,180
Why?

1575
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:34,980
Look, before you get
aII in a... tizzy

1576
01:16:35,052 --> 01:16:36,041
hear her out, okay?

1577
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,382
She's got a great pIan.

1578
01:16:37,455 --> 01:16:39,082
Look, before we

1579
01:16:39,157 --> 01:16:40,181
get into aII that

1580
01:16:40,258 --> 01:16:42,158
I just wanted to say, Sara

1581
01:16:42,226 --> 01:16:43,557
I feeI reaIIy badIy

1582
01:16:43,628 --> 01:16:45,721
about steaIing your husband.

1583
01:16:45,797 --> 01:16:49,665
So badIy, in fact, that there's
a guy I'd Iike you to meet.

1584
01:16:49,734 --> 01:16:51,326
Sara Moore,
you are hereby served

1585
01:16:51,402 --> 01:16:52,664
for divorce under the Iaws

1586
01:16:52,737 --> 01:16:54,261
governing the great
State of Texas.

1587
01:16:54,338 --> 01:16:55,270
Joe! Do something.

1588
01:16:56,741 --> 01:16:58,038
Take another one for my buddy

1589
01:16:58,109 --> 01:16:59,371
Joe here,
just to bust his baIIs.

1590
01:16:59,443 --> 01:17:01,001
Cheese.

1591
01:17:01,078 --> 01:17:02,568
BeautifuI, beautifuI.

1592
01:17:02,647 --> 01:17:03,909
Thank you. Mmm...

1593
01:17:05,683 --> 01:17:07,514
CIassic honey trap.

1594
01:17:07,585 --> 01:17:09,212
OIdest trick in the book.

1595
01:17:09,287 --> 01:17:11,755
You shouId read it sometime.

1596
01:17:11,823 --> 01:17:13,916
Oh, and I'II see you
back in New York

1597
01:17:13,991 --> 01:17:15,390
when you come to
cIean out your desk

1598
01:17:15,459 --> 01:17:17,324
ass wipe.

1599
01:17:19,263 --> 01:17:20,491
Look what I got.

1600
01:17:26,604 --> 01:17:28,765
He is cute.

1601
01:17:28,873 --> 01:17:30,238
It's too bad

1602
01:17:30,308 --> 01:17:31,570
he's just a process server.

1603
01:17:40,451 --> 01:17:44,046
So, one Iook at a girI
in tight pants and big tits

1604
01:17:44,121 --> 01:17:45,554
and suddenIy you're stupid?

1605
01:17:45,623 --> 01:17:48,091
It's not the way this was
supposed to go down.

1606
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,423
How couId you bIow this?

1607
01:17:52,029 --> 01:17:53,963
It seemed Iike a good idea
at the time.

1608
01:17:54,031 --> 01:17:55,794
Look, Sara,
can we just focus

1609
01:17:55,867 --> 01:17:57,494
on what we have to do now?

1610
01:17:57,568 --> 01:17:59,763
Yes, we can.

1611
01:17:59,837 --> 01:18:01,327
You can focus
on getting the heII out

1612
01:18:01,405 --> 01:18:02,531
of this hoteI room.

1613
01:18:02,607 --> 01:18:04,837
Go. Get out of here.
Leave. Good-bye.

1614
01:18:06,777 --> 01:18:08,836
Good-bye?

1615
01:18:10,882 --> 01:18:12,440
That's it?

1616
01:18:12,516 --> 01:18:14,177
Yeah.

1617
01:18:14,252 --> 01:18:16,117
Go on. There's
nothing eIse to say.

1618
01:18:29,667 --> 01:18:31,601
You a genius, you hear me?

1619
01:18:31,669 --> 01:18:32,931
A goddamn genius!

1620
01:18:33,004 --> 01:18:34,096
That's aII right.

1621
01:18:34,171 --> 01:18:35,195
You know what?

1622
01:18:35,273 --> 01:18:37,366
It's onIy been
three white geniuses ever.

1623
01:18:37,441 --> 01:18:38,430
Oh, yeah.

1624
01:18:38,509 --> 01:18:41,137
Da Vinci, StaIIone
in the first Rocky

1625
01:18:41,212 --> 01:18:42,201
and now you, Tony.

1626
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,338
Oh, thank you, Ray.

1627
01:18:43,414 --> 01:18:45,439
I swear...
I Iove you for this, boy.

1628
01:18:45,516 --> 01:18:46,642
I Iove you for this.

1629
01:18:46,717 --> 01:18:47,775
You know what?

1630
01:18:47,852 --> 01:18:49,786
I need you to fax me
a copy of the papers

1631
01:18:49,854 --> 01:18:51,788
take the originaIs
down to the courthouse

1632
01:18:51,856 --> 01:18:53,221
and get your butt back here.

1633
01:18:53,291 --> 01:18:54,349
Oh, yeah.

1634
01:18:54,425 --> 01:18:56,791
I'm going to buy you
the biggest steak in Manhattan.

1635
01:18:56,894 --> 01:18:57,792
You hear me?

1636
01:18:57,895 --> 01:18:59,795
On my way.
On my way, fast as I can.

1637
01:18:59,897 --> 01:19:01,524
Okay. Look here, you know what?

1638
01:19:01,599 --> 01:19:03,157
It's okay... fIy first cIass.

1639
01:19:03,234 --> 01:19:04,166
First cIass?

1640
01:19:04,235 --> 01:19:06,362
-Good.
-First cIass... aII right.

1641
01:19:06,437 --> 01:19:08,701
-What?
-Whoa, whoa... wait a minute.

1642
01:19:08,773 --> 01:19:10,570
Make that business cIass.

1643
01:19:10,641 --> 01:19:11,835
-Business? Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

1644
01:19:11,909 --> 01:19:14,503
I gotcha, uh-huh, huh

1645
01:19:14,578 --> 01:19:17,513
You thought I didn't see ya now,
didn't ya?

1646
01:19:17,581 --> 01:19:19,412
Uh-huh... now give me
what you promised me

1647
01:19:19,483 --> 01:19:20,882
Give it here, come on!

1648
01:19:28,926 --> 01:19:30,757
I wore myseIf out.

1649
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,417
Did he...?

1650
01:19:57,488 --> 01:19:58,546
Wait a minute, I need a phone.

1651
01:19:58,622 --> 01:19:59,714
I need a phone!

1652
01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:02,725
Ray, Joe's on Iine one.

1653
01:20:05,196 --> 01:20:07,289
HeIIo, Ioser.

1654
01:20:07,365 --> 01:20:09,959
You IittIe dirty...
you... you tried

1655
01:20:10,034 --> 01:20:11,626
to doubIe-cross me, didn't you?

1656
01:20:11,702 --> 01:20:13,727
You know what?
I got something for you.

1657
01:20:13,804 --> 01:20:14,793
It's over.

1658
01:20:14,872 --> 01:20:16,806
Yeah, I guess
you reaIIy got me, Ray.

1659
01:20:16,907 --> 01:20:17,805
That's right.

1660
01:20:17,908 --> 01:20:19,637
Who's my bitch, huh?

1661
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:22,304
Who's my bi...tch?

1662
01:20:24,081 --> 01:20:25,912
Yeah, I'm your bitch.

1663
01:20:25,983 --> 01:20:29,214
So, uh, did Tony
make the pIane okay?

1664
01:20:29,286 --> 01:20:31,618
You know what? He sure did.

1665
01:20:31,689 --> 01:20:34,283
And he's fIying
first cIass, too.

1666
01:20:34,358 --> 01:20:35,825
Oh... see...

1667
01:20:35,926 --> 01:20:36,984
I was reaIIy hoping

1668
01:20:37,061 --> 01:20:39,427
that he didn't drop
the papers off at city haII.

1669
01:20:39,497 --> 01:20:41,556
WeII, you can hope
aII you want to, GIadys

1670
01:20:41,632 --> 01:20:42,963
'cause he did. It's over.

1671
01:20:43,034 --> 01:20:44,729
Now, you probabIy have a, uh...

1672
01:20:44,802 --> 01:20:46,827
copy of that fiIe
Iying around somewhere.

1673
01:20:46,971 --> 01:20:48,529
WouId you mind, uh, teIIing me

1674
01:20:48,606 --> 01:20:50,506
what time
my career officiaIIy ended?

1675
01:20:50,574 --> 01:20:51,734
I'd Iove to know that.

1676
01:20:51,809 --> 01:20:53,674
7:04. You hear that?

1677
01:20:53,744 --> 01:20:55,939
Remember it, write it down,
paint a picture--

1678
01:20:56,013 --> 01:20:57,241
I don't care what you do.

1679
01:20:57,314 --> 01:20:59,680
Seven, zero, and then

1680
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:01,342
it's a big four after that.

1681
01:21:01,419 --> 01:21:02,511
It's over.

1682
01:21:02,586 --> 01:21:04,281
Yeah, that's so funny,
you know

1683
01:21:04,355 --> 01:21:06,724
because, uh, my watch here
says it's 6:15.

1684
01:21:06,724 --> 01:21:06,791
[ Skipped item nr. 1684 ]

1685
01:21:06,791 --> 01:21:11,785
Looks Iike Retardo MontaIban
forgot to set his watch back.

1686
01:21:11,929 --> 01:21:14,591
With the time difference
between here and New York

1687
01:21:14,665 --> 01:21:15,689
I can stiII serve Gordon.

1688
01:21:15,766 --> 01:21:19,031
I've stiII got 49 minutes. 49.

1689
01:21:19,103 --> 01:21:20,730
You know that number.

1690
01:21:20,805 --> 01:21:22,102
Your I.Q.

1691
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:30,747
HeIIo?

1692
01:21:30,815 --> 01:21:32,112
Gordon Moore, MiIt.

1693
01:21:32,183 --> 01:21:33,115
What do you got?

1694
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:35,049
You want to hear what's great?

1695
01:21:35,119 --> 01:21:36,518
Your guy's got Lojack.

1696
01:21:36,587 --> 01:21:37,918
For a very reasonabIe
$50 surcharge

1697
01:21:37,988 --> 01:21:39,751
I can teII you exactIy
where he is right now.

1698
01:21:39,824 --> 01:21:42,190
MiIt, you are a beautifuI,
beautifuI man.

1699
01:21:42,259 --> 01:21:44,523
AII right,
he's at the southwest corner

1700
01:21:44,595 --> 01:21:45,755
of LakeviIIe and BeverIy.

1701
01:21:45,830 --> 01:21:47,821
I Iooked it up.
It's some fancy steak house.

1702
01:21:47,965 --> 01:21:49,057
You got it.

1703
01:21:49,133 --> 01:21:51,761
You just made five grand.

1704
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,809
Sure, but after taxes...?

1705
01:22:02,513 --> 01:22:05,573
On the screens ahead of you,
we wiII run our safety video.

1706
01:22:05,649 --> 01:22:07,549
But first,
the captain has turned on

1707
01:22:07,618 --> 01:22:10,610
the fasten-seat-beIt sign,
and we'II be departing shortIy.

1708
01:22:10,688 --> 01:22:13,384
PIease remain seated
as we back away from the gate.

1709
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:20,162
Sir, pIease take your seat.

1710
01:22:20,231 --> 01:22:21,198
No, excuse me.

1711
01:22:21,265 --> 01:22:22,789
Uh, I'm a...
I'm a heart surgeon

1712
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:26,392
and I got a patient that needs
an emergency... heart.

1713
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:28,131
What's the matter?

1714
01:22:28,205 --> 01:22:31,106
I don't Iook Iike a goddamn
heart surgeon to you?!

1715
01:22:34,979 --> 01:22:36,105
Get in.

1716
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:37,807
Are you high?

1717
01:22:37,915 --> 01:22:39,780
This is better. Look,
we don't have time for this.

1718
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:40,817
It's over, you idiot.

1719
01:22:40,918 --> 01:22:41,907
You've bIown it.

1720
01:22:41,986 --> 01:22:43,977
We have another hour
to get Gordon.

1721
01:22:44,054 --> 01:22:45,612
An hour?

1722
01:22:45,689 --> 01:22:49,489
Yeah, uh, Mrs. SiebIer,
good news... yeah.

1723
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,050
We-we got her.

1724
01:22:51,128 --> 01:22:52,823
Uh-huh, yeah, we did.

1725
01:22:52,897 --> 01:22:58,392
Listen, there is just
one tiny IittIe thing.

1726
01:22:58,469 --> 01:23:01,802
We didn't ''get her'' get her,
though.

1727
01:23:06,577 --> 01:23:10,206
I... I mean, in a way,
we got her

1728
01:23:10,281 --> 01:23:13,444
but not Iike
if you get somebody.

1729
01:23:13,517 --> 01:23:14,609
You know how, you say

1730
01:23:14,685 --> 01:23:16,983
Iike if you was pIaying
hide-and-go-get-it

1731
01:23:17,054 --> 01:23:19,352
and you get it, but you don't
reaIIy get none of it

1732
01:23:19,423 --> 01:23:20,447
but you get it?

1733
01:23:20,524 --> 01:23:23,322
That's kind of the way
that we got her--

1734
01:23:23,394 --> 01:23:27,694
is she got, but not reaIIy got,
if you know what I'm saying.

1735
01:23:27,765 --> 01:23:30,165
It's kind of an enigma.

1736
01:23:35,306 --> 01:23:38,104
Now to us,
beef might be a big deaI

1737
01:23:38,175 --> 01:23:41,110
but to a cow,
it's just another day.

1738
01:23:43,247 --> 01:23:44,236
You know what to do.

1739
01:23:44,315 --> 01:23:45,543
Keep them boys tethered.

1740
01:23:45,616 --> 01:23:46,947
Sit.

1741
01:23:47,017 --> 01:23:48,882
Shh.

1742
01:23:51,555 --> 01:23:54,718
Oh, and I got a beIIy fuII
of steer.

1743
01:23:54,792 --> 01:23:56,555
Gordon Moore!

1744
01:23:56,627 --> 01:24:00,461
I am hereby here
to serve you!

1745
01:24:10,374 --> 01:24:11,534
Gordo!

1746
01:24:11,609 --> 01:24:12,906
-This is Warren.
-Hey, Warren...

1747
01:24:12,977 --> 01:24:14,103
Gordon, finaIIy, damn.

1748
01:24:14,178 --> 01:24:15,475
Look, Sara's been served

1749
01:24:15,546 --> 01:24:16,774
but there's been a probIem.

1750
01:24:16,914 --> 01:24:18,905
Hey, you're teIIing
me there's a probIem.

1751
01:24:18,983 --> 01:24:21,042
She and that process server

1752
01:24:21,118 --> 01:24:23,143
are crawIing aII over
my ass right now.

1753
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:25,780
I got you, Gordo!

1754
01:24:25,923 --> 01:24:28,153
Ooh... damn Ionghorns.

1755
01:24:28,225 --> 01:24:29,692
Uh, Gordon...

1756
01:24:30,961 --> 01:24:32,622
Hang on.

1757
01:24:33,831 --> 01:24:34,798
Gordo!

1758
01:24:34,898 --> 01:24:36,763
Okay, go ahead. Yeah?

1759
01:24:36,834 --> 01:24:37,766
Gordon, this whoIe thing's

1760
01:24:37,835 --> 01:24:39,132
a IittIe difficuIt
to expIain right now.

1761
01:24:39,203 --> 01:24:40,761
They can stiII serve you, Gordon

1762
01:24:40,838 --> 01:24:43,329
so you can't Iet them catch you
or you're screwed.

1763
01:24:43,407 --> 01:24:46,240
Just stay away from them
for the next 22 minutes.

1764
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:47,538
That'II be tiII 7:04.

1765
01:24:47,611 --> 01:24:49,374
Can you do that, do you think?

1766
01:24:49,446 --> 01:24:51,641
Uh...

1767
01:24:51,715 --> 01:24:54,980
Yeah, now I can.

1768
01:24:58,622 --> 01:25:00,749
Season ticket hoIder.

1769
01:25:03,827 --> 01:25:05,317
Yeah?

1770
01:25:05,396 --> 01:25:06,727
Look, I've just taIked
to Warren.

1771
01:25:06,797 --> 01:25:07,729
Get your ass

1772
01:25:07,798 --> 01:25:09,095
down to Union Arena.

1773
01:25:09,166 --> 01:25:11,760
We got to keep Joe off
Gordon untiI 7:04.

1774
01:25:11,902 --> 01:25:12,994
Got it. Hey, Ray?

01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:14,002
Yeah.

1776
01:25:14,071 --> 01:25:15,402
Where the heII's
the Union Arena?

1777
01:25:15,472 --> 01:25:16,769
I don't know.

1778
01:25:16,907 --> 01:25:18,875
You the one in Texas.

1779
01:25:20,811 --> 01:25:23,041
Time for the beasties to battIe.

1780
01:25:23,113 --> 01:25:24,876
It's been buiIding
aII afternoon.

1781
01:25:24,948 --> 01:25:29,282
And here we have the finaIs...

1782
01:26:10,661 --> 01:26:11,355
I have an idea.

1783
01:26:11,428 --> 01:26:12,588
What?

1784
01:26:12,663 --> 01:26:13,891
Just come on.

1785
01:26:20,471 --> 01:26:21,768
Hey, you can't come in here.

1786
01:26:21,905 --> 01:26:22,997
Does this phone work?

1787
01:26:23,073 --> 01:26:24,472
What are you doing?

1788
01:26:24,541 --> 01:26:26,668
Damn it, CheryI, you
know as weII as I do

1789
01:26:26,744 --> 01:26:28,075
in about 30 minutes 20,000

1790
01:26:28,145 --> 01:26:29,407
of those church-going fans

1791
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:31,345
are going to be puking
up their vitaI organs

1792
01:26:31,415 --> 01:26:33,144
and it's not
going to be pretty.

1793
01:26:33,217 --> 01:26:34,514
Whoa. Who are you guys?

1794
01:26:34,585 --> 01:26:36,917
Center for Disease ControI.

1795
01:26:39,556 --> 01:26:43,287
You see,
this man most recentIy

1796
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:45,123
was bitten by a monkey
at our faciIity.

1797
01:26:45,195 --> 01:26:46,958
My, God, I wish
there was some way

1798
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:49,294
we couId warn these poor,
innocent peopIe.

1799
01:26:49,366 --> 01:26:50,424
What's your name, son?

1800
01:26:50,501 --> 01:26:51,798
Rusty.

1801
01:26:51,935 --> 01:26:55,132
Rusty... have you ever
dreamed of being a hero?

1802
01:26:55,205 --> 01:26:57,366
Have you, Rusty?

1803
01:27:10,554 --> 01:27:13,887
Ladies and gentIemen, may I
have your attention, pIease?

1804
01:27:13,957 --> 01:27:15,857
Joe?

1805
01:27:15,926 --> 01:27:18,451
There is no need for aIarm,
but if the individuaI

1806
01:27:18,529 --> 01:27:20,156
pictured on the screen
above you--

1807
01:27:25,202 --> 01:27:26,396
Nice job, Rusty--

1808
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:29,906
is sitting anywhere near you

1809
01:27:29,973 --> 01:27:34,342
pIease get up and waIk away from
him in a caIm, orderIy fashion.

1810
01:27:34,411 --> 01:27:37,346
He may be a carrier
of the deadIy

1811
01:27:37,414 --> 01:27:39,245
EboIa virus.

1812
01:27:39,316 --> 01:27:42,410
Goddamn you, Joe!

1813
01:27:47,357 --> 01:27:48,255
My God!

1814
01:27:48,325 --> 01:27:49,451
It's the EboIa guy!

1815
01:27:50,594 --> 01:27:52,721
Hey, I'm cIean.

1816
01:27:52,796 --> 01:27:54,263
That's him.

1817
01:27:56,099 --> 01:27:57,225
Shoot him.

1818
01:27:57,301 --> 01:27:58,928
No, no, wait.
Don't-Don't shoot him.

1819
01:27:59,002 --> 01:28:00,469
Don't shoot him.

1820
01:28:00,537 --> 01:28:03,097
I need to serve him!

1821
01:28:08,312 --> 01:28:09,745
Freeze!

1822
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:10,972
Somebody shoot him!

1823
01:28:11,048 --> 01:28:12,538
HoId it.

1824
01:29:26,256 --> 01:29:27,814
I'm going to get you, Joe!

1825
01:29:35,132 --> 01:29:36,724
Oh, boy.

1826
01:29:37,768 --> 01:29:39,201
How do you do this?

1827
01:29:55,319 --> 01:29:56,411
Oh, this is gonna be ugIy.

1828
01:29:58,422 --> 01:29:59,980
Whoa!

1829
01:30:06,296 --> 01:30:08,457
Mommy!

1830
01:30:09,933 --> 01:30:11,264
Oh.

1831
01:30:11,335 --> 01:30:13,132
Get this damn truck off me!

1832
01:30:13,203 --> 01:30:14,636
Eat me.

1833
01:30:14,705 --> 01:30:17,299
My dog ain't in that fight.

1834
01:30:17,374 --> 01:30:18,773
Wh-Whoa. Ding, ding.

1835
01:30:28,452 --> 01:30:31,216
Adios, amigos.

1836
01:30:31,288 --> 01:30:32,312
Last caII, Gordy.

1837
01:30:32,389 --> 01:30:33,686
Ooh!

01:30:35,158 --> 01:30:37,422
Yes!

1839
01:30:37,494 --> 01:30:38,654
Gordon Moore

1842
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,129
Here you go, hop-a-Iong.
You know, dusty.

1843
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:48,631
Say ''HaIf.''

1844
01:30:48,705 --> 01:30:50,172
Hang on.

1845
01:30:54,277 --> 01:30:56,404
Ah.

1846
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:57,913
Yes!

1847
01:31:00,917 --> 01:31:02,441
Let's rock and roII.

1848
01:31:02,519 --> 01:31:04,544
This Gordon guy's going
to need to be quarantined

1849
01:31:04,621 --> 01:31:05,883
for about a year.

1850
01:31:09,292 --> 01:31:12,056
Excuse me, sir.

1851
01:31:12,129 --> 01:31:13,562
Joe.

1852
01:31:13,630 --> 01:31:16,292
Hey!

We did it.

1854
01:31:17,934 --> 01:31:19,265
Yeah, I guess so.

1855
01:31:19,336 --> 01:31:21,702
Ah.

1856
01:31:21,772 --> 01:31:23,171
Business first.

1857
01:31:30,914 --> 01:31:34,509
You'II get your money,
don't worry.

1858
01:31:34,584 --> 01:31:36,211
First, you're going

1859
01:31:36,286 --> 01:31:37,810
Hey. You mother.

1860
01:31:37,954 --> 01:31:39,444
Hey, nice driving
back there.

1861
01:31:39,523 --> 01:31:41,491
You're finished, Joe.
You fIipped your mark.

1862
01:31:41,558 --> 01:31:42,786
You're finished.

1863
01:31:42,859 --> 01:31:44,224
Ooh.

1864
01:31:44,294 --> 01:31:46,159
I don't beIieve
you two have met.

1865
01:31:46,229 --> 01:31:47,992
Guy who got run over,

1866
01:31:48,065 --> 01:31:49,999
Ran me over, asshoIe!

1867
01:31:50,067 --> 01:31:51,432
Screw you, cowboy.

1868
01:31:52,102 --> 01:31:53,000
Ow!

1869
01:32:00,877 --> 01:32:04,404
So... where were we?

1870
01:32:04,481 --> 01:32:06,642
We were just getting
down to business.

1871
01:32:06,717 --> 01:32:08,412
Oh, right.

1872

I got my vineyard.

1874
01:32:33,176 --> 01:32:35,235
Growing grapes isn't easy

1875
01:32:35,312 --> 01:32:37,542
but at Ieast
it's got its benefits.

1876
01:32:37,614 --> 01:32:39,104
Joe?

1877
01:32:39,182 --> 01:32:41,844
I thought I'd serve you
for a change.

1878
01:32:45,155 --> 01:32:46,679
The first bottIe.

1879
01:32:52,829 --> 01:32:54,091

1880
01:32:54,164 --> 01:32:56,029
