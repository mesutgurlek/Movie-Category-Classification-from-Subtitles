it's to give you people what you want.

Mmm. My daddy.

259
00:19:55,444 --> 00:20:00,365
He had this old Washburn steel-string.

260
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,450
He couldn't play a lick on it.

261
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,494
I, you know, picked it up,
started fooling' with it.

262
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,789
- Guess that's how.
- Right. And what were you listening' to?

263
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,667
Bunch of people

Georgia Wildcats. You ever hear of them?

266
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,969
Uh, no, I never heard the Georgia
Wildcats. Nah, I didn't figure you did.

267
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,138
How about Hank Williams?

268
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,390
Mmm. Gene Autry?
You know, Waylon and them boys?

269
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,475
Right. Lefty Frizzell?

- You want a drink?
- No, thank you.

271
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,612
So, you said-

272
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:42,574
You feel like your music is also
influenced by the blues? Oh, yeah.

Son House, Big Bill Bronzy.

274
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,496
We all owe our existence
to them Delta boys.

275
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,790
You ever want to do anything else?

276
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,920
Play baseball.

277
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:59,090
I was pretty good, too,
you know, for a while there.

278
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,427
I couldn't hit the curveball.

279
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:06,181
Well, I just figured
I'd stick with the guitar, you know?

280
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,975
Son of a bitch stayed
where he was supposed to.

281
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:18,777
How about you?
You always want to be a writer?

282
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,740
I didn't know
what I wanted for a long time.

283
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,450
But now you do?

284
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,161
Well, now I know what
I don't want to do again.

285
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,789
Yeah. Amen.

- I was.

287
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,713
One of those things
you don't want to do again?

288
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,759
Not unless it's right. Yeah.
How the hell do you know?

289
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,220
Well, you tell me.
You've been married five times.

290
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,931
Jesus Christ. Four times.

291
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,558
Come on. Four times.

292
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,686
You going to make another album
with Tommy Sweet?

293
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,480
Two things I don't want to talk about-
multiple marriages and Tommy.

294
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,566
Right. What's your real name?

295
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:02,153
I'm Bad Blake.

296
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,948
I wasn't born Bad.

297
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:08,576
When I die, my tombstone
will have my real name on it.

298
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,788
Until then, I'm just going to stay Bad.

299
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,166
It's an awful long time
for people to have to wait to find out.

300
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,377
Mmm. Maybe, maybe not.

301
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,381
You a daddy? You got any kids?

302
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,389
Sweetie, I'm going to have
to start getting' going' here.

303
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:35,770
All right. Can you give me
just another half an hour after the show?

304
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,897
Well, let's see how it goes, huh?

305
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,569
I appreciate you having to do
your work. I understand that.

306

I taught him country, you know?

00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:20,388
He won't admit it. He's got to compete
with what's coming out of Nashville today.

00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,098
But, yeah, he's real country.

00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,783
Hey, I just called to tell you you're out
of the Red Bison Lounge...

- You're opening for Tommy.

No, no. No. No goddamn way.

00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:05,219
I haven't been able to convince him
about doing the record yet.

414
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,764
But at least I got him to agree to
this. No, I'm not going to do it, Jack.

415
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:12,226
I'm not going to open for Tommy.
I'll open for somebody else, but not Tommy.

416
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,438
Who else are you going to open for? You're going
to open for Madonna? You want me to call her?

417
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,566
The dream of every sideman
is that someday the front man,

whose ass he's been staring' at for years,
is going to open for him.

I don't owe him a fucking' thing.

We both know Tommy owes you big.

But we also both know
how much this is worth.

422
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:32,914
I'm going to call you back this
afternoon. There is no time, Bad.

Yes or no? I've got to have time
to think about this. Come on.

Now don't fuck it up, all right?

429
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,598
Hey, let me ask you something.

430
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,352
Am I going to actually get to go backstage
and meet Tommy and everything?

00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:38,013
Yeah, that's what they tell me.
Too damn sweet for me.

611
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:41,016
Hell, I never liked it either.
But when you're one of Bad's Boys,

612
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,185
you got to be able
to put away the whiskey.

613
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,395
I'm sorry. I-I hate to interrupt.

614
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,565
Can I get an autograph,
Tommy? Thanks.
Sure.

615
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:52,569
You're my favourite.
I-I got all your records.
Thank you.

616
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:57,115
But this is the, uh-
This is the autograph you need.

That's Bad Blake.

618
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,331
Taught me
everything I know.
Cool.

619
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:09,670
Great. Thanks.
I'll be at your show tonight.

620
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:13,340
I may even make it
to San Diego.
Appreciate your support.

621
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:17,928
I was thinking' about-
about our tours together.

They were
some good times, boy.

00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:26,770
Look, I'm really glad
you agreed to do this, Bad.

625

Oh, God. Are you kidding'?

626
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,775
I need the money.

627
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,070
Wasn't for this,
I'd be playing some saloon
in Benson, Arizona.

00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,163
we broke down on the desert

Just you and me

Isn’t remembering wonderful?

00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:03,390
How's the tour going?
It's a grind.

636
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,892
Fifty dates
in two months.
Oh.

637
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:08,729
How about yours?
I'm out for a month.
Six states.

00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,897
Pickup bands?
Yeah.

639
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,066
That's a ball buster.

640
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,277
Hell, we should've gotten together earlier,
done the whole tour.

641
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:18,030
{ Coughing }
We tried that.

642
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,575
There was just too much going' on, Bad.

643
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,119
That damn movie shoot down in Mexico.

644
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:27,247
Jill was on my ass
all the time.
Yeah.

645
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:30,751
Would've been
a hell of a tour though.
Oh, yeah. Hell of a tour.

646
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,381
Aw, shit.
I'm sorry, Bad, it didn't work out.

647
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,926
I was trying' to keep
my marriage together.

648
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:42,888
Don't hold that
against me.
I got a career too.

649
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:45,766
And a marriage or two
I wanted to hold together.

650
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:48,935
I know. I know.
{ Sighs }

651
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,646
You gave me my start, Bad.

652
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:54,066
Don't think I don't remember that.

653
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,152
But I got a life too.

654
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,571
Well, well.

655
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,992
Those are the ugliest
goddamn boots
l've ever seen in my life.

656
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:06,620

to shoot your dog?

Oh.
{ Coughs }
{ Laughing }

658
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:13,502
Hey. How come
we're not doing' another album?

659
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:17,631
Why won't you do it?
Hold up now.
I never said I wouldn't.

660
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,966
DMZ just doesn't think
it's the right thing to do. That's all.

661
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:23,303
Mmm, I think it is.
Well, you may be right.

662
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:25,680
They want a couple more solos first.
Then we do a duet.

663
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:29,017
And you got first shot.
I already told them.

664
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:31,812
You know, I need money now.

665
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:35,982
I'm 57 years old.
Career's going' nowhere.

666
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:38,276
I need something
to get it jump-started.

667
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:42,489
They won't give me
a damn solo album.

668
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,699
I need this, goddamn it.
I really do.

669
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:47,327
I swear, Bad. I can't get them
to budge on this one.

670
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:53,125
But there is a way you can make
some money if you want to.

671
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:00,340
Enlighten me.
Songs.

672
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:02,092
I isn’t got no new material.

673
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,718
Everything I'm hearing is straight crap.

674
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:05,720
You write me five new songs,
I'll give you back end.

675
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:08,473
I ship two million albums
every time I release one.

I haven't written a new song
in three years.

677
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,728
Too many goddamn songs.

678
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:15,897
You write some of the best
material out there, Bad. I want some.

679
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:18,316
Wrote. Wrote. Not write.

680
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,365

you still got old Bessie.

The problem isn't your ankle.
It will heal cleanly.

But I, you know-
I didn't, uh-

01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:50,433
Never taught him how to ride a bike or
watched him play baseball. None of that.

01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:53,144
Why not?

I wasn't there, even when I was.

Hello?

1066
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:04,212
Uh, hi. Uh, is this Steven Reynolds?

1067
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:06,339
Yeah, this is he. Who's calling?

1068
01:13:06,424 --> 01:13:08,842
Uh- Uh- Well, actually,

1069
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:11,470
I'm on a bit of a hunting trip here, buddy.

1070
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:14,514
I'm trying to track down a Mary Jo Reynolds.

1071
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:19,561
She lived in, uh, Nashville
from 1980 to 1985.

1072
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:23,482
She was born in Lima, Ohio.

1073
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:26,359
You wouldn't be related
by any chance, would you?

1074
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:29,071
She was my mother.

1075
01:13:29,197 --> 01:13:31,490
{ Sighs }
Hey, buddy,
I can't hear you.

1076
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:34,409
Who-Who is this?

1077
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:38,872
Your father.
Who?

1078
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:43,043
{ Sighs }
I'm Bad Blake, uh, here in Houston.

1079
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:45,170
I'm your father.

1080
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,969
How are ya?
What do you want?

1081
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:57,891
{ Chuckles }
I'm kind of shocked hearing' your voice.

1082
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:00,477
You said "was."

1083
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:07,192
Mary Jo's dead?
Two years
come this October.

1084
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:13,657
What happened?
Everything.

1085
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:17,828
I'm sorry, Steven.
Yeah, well, listen.
What do you want?

1086
01:14:19,664 --> 01:14:22,249
I want to see you.

1087
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:24,459
I don't think so.

1088
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:29,923
Well, will you-
Will you think about it?

1089
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:33,301
I'm sorry, sir.
I probably won't be able to help you.

1090
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:36,471
You know,
take down my number so-

1091
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:38,557
I got your number.

1092
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:45,105
Uh-huh. Well-
{ Sighs }

1093
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:49,734
You know, sleep on it,
think about it, and, uh-

1094
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:52,404
Really would like to talk.

1095
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,699
Imagine that.

{ Beeps }
{ Buddy }
I made the cars go real fast.

1098
01:15:56,928 --> 01:16:00,096
Real fast! Then the Jeep
went around the corner,

1099
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:03,308
and it went boom!
Oh, you got
the cars, huh?

1100
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:07,187
I can make them
go faster than anybody!
Then they crash!

1101
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:09,981
What he's trying to say is thank you.

1102
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:12,192
But, you know, you've got to stop.

1103
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:14,861
You got to stop sending him things.
He thinks you're Santa Claus.

1104
01:16:14,946 --> 01:16:17,155
{ Buddy }
I do think he's Santa Claus.

1105
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:20,033
Well, I just- I wanted him to know
I'm thinking' about him, darling'.

1106
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:24,454
You thinking' about me?
{ Jean }
Yes, I am.

1107
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:29,125
You all right?
Called my son
last night, Jeannie.

1108
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:31,878
And?

1109
01:16:31,963 --> 01:16:36,341
Well, he wouldn't talk to me.

1110
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:39,052
Oh, I'm sorry.

1111
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:41,304
I don't blame him.

Jeannie.

1113

Hey!
{ Groans Loudly }

We're going' fishing', all right?

1122
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:37,277
Let's go. You forget?
Let's go. Come on. Get dressed.

1123
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:39,404
I'm waiting' on ya.

1124
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:48,621
Toss me another one
of those barley pops, would ya?

1125
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:51,499
Okay. Yeah.
{ Coughs }

{ Blows, Groans }

1130
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:09,517
I just sent what might be
my best song ever to Tommy.

1131
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:11,853
What, to record?
Yeah.

1132
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:15,482
It's one of those
you hate to give up.
Why'd you do it?

1133
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:18,526
Oh, he's paying' me awful good.

1134
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:20,945
He's in L.A. now recording' it.

1135
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:24,324
Well, I hope he don't fuck it up.

1136
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:26,743
Oh, he can't fuck it up. It's that good.

{ Chuckles, Coughs }

So, your boy-
Your boy don't want to talk to you?

No.

1140
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:41,674
I don't blame him.
I was wrong.
I had no right to call him.

1141
01:18:41,759 --> 01:18:45,512
Wait. Hold on.
You was wrong 25 years ago
and you've been wrong since.

1142
01:18:45,596 --> 01:18:49,516
But you called him.
Now you're not wrong.
You're right. He's wrong.

1143
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,020
Wayne, I went 24 years
without trying' to find him.

1144
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:56,815
He's right.
Too little, too late.
No.

1145
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:59,401
Never too late, son. Never too late.

1146
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:02,445
You called, and it's done.
All right? It's complete.

1147
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:04,531
Now, you're on the right track.

1148
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:08,660
You just-just keep going',
'cause he's your son. Right?

1149
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:12,622
Well, he's all I got.
Well, you keep after him.

1150
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:15,375
Do what you got to do.

1151
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:18,044
It's like, you know, you reminded me.

1152
01:19:18,129 --> 01:19:20,547
That song by Billy Joe Shaver.

1153
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:23,675
I'm going to live forever. I'm going to cross
that river when I catch tomorrow now.

1154
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:28,263
Oh, yeah.
Goes something' like-

¶¶ Nobody here will ever find me ¶¶ 

1156

Hello?
Hi.

1166
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:06,801
Hey!
You all right?

1167
01:20:06,886 --> 01:20:10,597
- Yeah, I'm fine. Why?
- You didn't sound like
you were all right yesterday.

1168
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:12,849
You sounded like
you were dying a slow death.

1169
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:17,770
Oh. Think it must've- I don't know-
been food poisoning or something.

1170
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:22,025
Well, I'm calling because
I got four days off at the end of this month,

1171
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:24,235
and I thought we might come.

1172
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:28,615
Oh.
But I'm not sure it'd be
such a good idea.

1173
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:32,035
What are you talking about?
It's a great idea. Why would you say that?

1174
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:34,412
You sure you're okay?

1175
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:36,581
I'm worried about you.

1176
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:39,125
Don't waste a minute worrying about me.

1177
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:42,754
There's nothing' wrong
that a visit wouldn't cure.
How's Buddy boy doing'?

1178
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,881
He's fine.

{ Jean }

Go through the tunnel there.

Well, I think he's had it.

You all right, Bud?
He's eating'-
He's eating' in his sleep.

{ Bad } What do you think of these
big buildings, huh, Bud?

I bet Superman couldn't even
leap over these things.

Right here in this town...

1187
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:55,910
is where Sam Houston and his boys
beat Santa Ana and his Mexicans.

we'd all be speaking' Mexican.

got its star, right there.

Where's that big turtle?

1194
01:22:15,306 --> 01:22:17,974
What do you see there?
Where'd he go?

1195
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:22,103
I think there's
a lobster that was in here.

You getting' tired?
Oh.

1197
01:22:24,315 --> 01:22:28,359
He's got so much energy,
he wears me out sometimes.

Why don't you go back to that park?
Take a Load off.

Huh? Here's the spot.

1203

Here.

1204
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:51,257
Pick one. Pick some.
You can have a bunch.

1205
01:22:51,342 --> 01:22:54,927
There you go. That's good.
