1
00:01:09,397 --> 00:01:13,151
- Hi.
- Who, me? Him?

2
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:18,239
- Not you.
- Don't worry about it.

3
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:30,250
Hey!

4
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:57,275
- How are you doing?
- Oh, fuck off.

5
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,155
- What's up?
- Feel good. All right.

6
00:02:03,364 --> 00:02:08,243
Excuse me.

7
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:15,291
- Yeah. Score.
- Very nice.

8
00:02:23,424 --> 00:02:28,261
All right. Let's talk
to this little lady called Night.

9
00:02:38,354 --> 00:02:41,148
I broke the window again.

10
00:02:41,357 --> 00:02:45,152
- Dad's gonna be pissed.
- I'll just tell him you did it.

11
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,240
But I didn't do it.
I'm driving. Don't do that.

12
00:02:56,412 --> 00:03:00,166
So anyways, I'm standing there,
waiting to use the pay phone ...

13
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:05,337
And this guy on the phone turns
around and tips his hat like this.

14
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:10,133
And who do you think that guy was?

15
00:03:10,383 --> 00:03:15,304
- Emilio Estevez.
- 'The Mighty Duck'. I was there!

16
00:03:15,388 --> 00:03:20,267
Of course you were. You yelled
the "Breakfast Clubber's" name.

17
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:29,276
So, anyway.
You guys wanna make out or what?

18
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:05,142
Oh, man. lt was perfect that time.

19
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,230
Four months of work for nothing.

20
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:15,109
- What's up?
- Did you know you were doing 50?

21
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,281
Hottie cop likes you. Think she pulls
over just anybody? Make a move.

22
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:28,163
- What's up?
- Just giving you an $80 ticket.

23
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:33,293
She is so into you.

24
00:04:35,378 --> 00:04:40,257
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Whatever you say, 'T.J. Hooker".

25
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:48,265
Please obey all posted speed limits.
Have a good night.

26
00:04:48,348 --> 00:04:53,269
It's already been good, now
that you've served and protected me.

27
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:11,328
- What was the point of that?
- Sorry.

28
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:22,254
Come next week. I'm gonna
take care of you. All right, man.

29
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:25,132
This is the Roxbury. We have a list.

30
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:29,135
- We're on the list. Doug Butabi.
- Steve Butabi.

31
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:32,138
- You're brothers?
- No.

32
00:05:32,347 --> 00:05:37,310
- Yes. Man!
- That's quite a joke.

33
00:05:37,393 --> 00:05:40,146
- Doug is hilarious.
- Check this out.

34
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:45,317
You ever heard of this one?
You're not on the list. Get in line.

35
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:55,284
- ls that ..?
- It's the king of "21 Jump Street".

36
00:05:55,368 --> 00:06:00,247
Richard Grieco.

37
00:06:02,374 --> 00:06:06,128
- Excuse me.
- See you later. We'll go wait in line.

38
00:06:06,378 --> 00:06:09,130
- Maybe we'll hang out later?
- No chance.

39
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:14,260
- Sounds good.
- Know what's wrong with this place?

40
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:20,224
- They don't evaluate the clientele.
- I thought we just weren't cool enough.

41
00:06:21,392 --> 00:06:26,271
You are a beautiful man. Know what
we're gonna do when we get our club?

42
00:06:27,397 --> 00:06:32,277
We're gonna treat all wannabes just
as well as any legendary tv-star.

43
00:06:33,403 --> 00:06:38,241
- That's pretty Roosevelt of you.
- It's just what I believe in.

44
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:44,121
- Wanna dance?
- We're not in the club yet.

45
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:48,125
So, maybe when we get in?

46
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:53,338
So I'm waiting to use the pay phone,
and this guy tips his hat like this.

47
00:06:56,382 --> 00:07:01,303
- And who do you think that guy was?
- Emilio Estevez!

48
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:06,266
'The Mighty Duck', man. I swear
to God. I was, like, "Emilio!"

49
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:13,314
"Emilio .. !"

50
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:18,235
The club is closed, folks. Sorry.

51
00:07:44,384 --> 00:07:49,306
- Nozzled you, my friend.
- Totally got me.

52
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:54,269
That was in my nose.

53
00:07:56,395 --> 00:08:01,275
- You're an idiot.
- Oh yeah? You like it.

54
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:07,280
Get off ... Watch it!

55
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:15,329
Where's Mom? And who's this
gorgeous young hottie in the kitchen?

56
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:20,292
- Why is she wearing Mom's bathrobe?
- What do you think of my new chin?

57
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,171
ls it better than last year's?

58
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:29,301
Behave yourselves. Look who's
gracing us with their presence.

59
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,220
- Who?
- Here, Dad.

60
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:37,308
It's a health shake.
lt helps me hit my physical peak.

61
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:41,103
Get the camera.
He's gonna hit his peak.

62
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:46,233
- Honey, do it in your room.
- Oh, Mom, you're so funny.

63
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:51,279
Steve? In the store in a haIf hour.
Wear something nice. Emily's back.

64
00:08:52,363 --> 00:08:56,117
As if he gives a flying rat's ass.

65
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:59,161
"Flying rat's ass ..."
That would be wild to see.

66
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:04,291
Steve, at the store in a haIf hour.
Bring your dancing monkey brother.

67
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:06,223
Hey, are you from out of town?
You have a local number?

68
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:16,232
Are you all right? Sure?

69
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:30,287
Finally. An hour and a haIf late.
Steve, go dust the roses.

70
00:10:32,413 --> 00:10:36,167
ldiot boy,
go cover the cash register.

71
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:41,297
ldiot boy,
go cover the cash register.

72
00:10:46,343 --> 00:10:51,264
Hi. How are you paying for these?
Cash, check or charge?

73
00:10:53,349 --> 00:10:55,184
- Charge.
- Okay.

74
00:10:55,393 --> 00:11:00,272
- ls this a Visa or a Mastercard?
- Move your thumb.

75
00:11:00,397 --> 00:11:04,151
Good one. Okay.

76
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:09,322
Sure this is your card? It's not
processing. I have to call it in.

77
00:11:20,374 --> 00:11:24,169
- Operator 238, please.
- Authorisation. Card number?

78
00:11:24,378 --> 00:11:28,131
- What's up?
- I told you not to call anymore.

79
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,135
- I need an approval.
- Card number?

80
00:11:32,385 --> 00:11:37,265
- Not the card, sweetness, me.
- Shut up and swipe it.

81
00:11:38,391 --> 00:11:42,144
I can go for that.

82
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:47,315
You like that? Does that feel good?
'Cause I can swipe it all night.

83
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,321
- The card's fine. Bye, Doug.
- Bye, 238.

84
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:59,160
Hi. Can I help you?

85
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,289
Hi, Doug. Your nightclub's so cool.
Can my model friends come in?

86
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:08,168
- No. Yes.
- You're so funny and cute and tall.

87
00:12:08,376 --> 00:12:10,170
Let's shake it.

88
00:12:10,337 --> 00:12:15,299
What are you doing? You have to cut up
my plants and make toys of them?

89
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:20,137
- It's a club with a jungle theme.
- You're a jungle theme.

90
00:12:20,387 --> 00:12:25,309
Go find your brother and load
the trucks. ldiot ... Useless!

91
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:39,155
- Steve ..?
- Don't look.

92
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:44,284
- Hi, Steve. Hey, Doug.
- Whatever.

93
00:12:54,377 --> 00:12:57,129
Now I'm back,
so we can get together.

94
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,133
- You wanna go see a movie?
- Sure.

95
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:06,263
Or we could just drive around
and make out. I love making out.

96
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:13,311
- And I'm really good at it.
- Sounds good.

97
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:18,274
Back off, Chicklett. My brother and
I, we live life in the fast lane.

98
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,153
That means no stop signs,
no pulling over to take pictures.

99
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:28,283
See this man? He's my co-pilot
on this magic carpet ride.

100
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:33,246
- You're just way too much luggage.
- Shut up, Doug.

101
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:39,293
Emily?
I see you've picked the right son.

102
00:13:40,377 --> 00:13:44,131
You know, Steve likes you very much.

103
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:49,302
Mr. Butabi. ls Steve asking Emily
to marry him again?

104
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:54,140
You know something?
If they have enough children, -

105
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,143
- we won't have to hire salesmen.

106
00:13:57,393 --> 00:14:02,273
- Oh, Kamehl, you kill me.
- No, you kill me, Mr. Sanderson.

107
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:08,278
- Can you please leave Steve alone?
- He likes the girl ... Yes, you do!

108
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:15,284
You see this wall? After they
get married, we'll combine stores -

109
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:19,163
- and have the first plant-lamp
shop. Steve and Emily will run it.

110
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:24,251
- Maybe you can clean the toilets.
- You're living on "Fantasy lsland".

111
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:31,132
- God, that was a sweet show.
- I have a fantasy.

112
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:36,262
That I have two capable sons.
Not one with his head up his ass!

113
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:41,308
ls this how you load trucks?
Disgusting. Get out of here.

114
00:14:45,395 --> 00:14:49,149
- So we're on a break?
- I guess.

115
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:54,320
- You wanna crunch it?
- Sure. Let's crunch.

116
00:14:58,366 --> 00:15:03,287
- Can the rest of us use the mirror?
- Appreciate it.

117
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,124
- Everyone's got an attitude here.
- Gentlemen! Looking large.

118
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:12,253
Want my power bar?
How about an energy bar?

119
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:17,300
- I got a muscle triplicator bar.
- Supplements aside ...

120
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:22,137
- How long have we been friends?
- All seven years of high school.

121
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:27,309
That's why I'm not gonna sugar coat
it. I'm worried about your triceps.

122
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:34,315
You aren't going all the way down.
I'm not seeing full extension.

123
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,320
We had a long talk about that
the other night.

124
00:15:39,362 --> 00:15:44,241
You just shouldn't cheat yourselves.
Sorry to come down on you like this.

125
00:15:46,368 --> 00:15:50,121
That's why we love you and hate you.

126
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:53,124
- Still friends?
- You know it.

127
00:15:53,374 --> 00:15:58,254
I'm glad we had this talk.

128
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:15,144
I had a great idea for the store ...

129
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:20,274
The store? You're supposed to be
thinking about ... Hey, what's up?

130
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:26,280
- Can we call you sometime?
- Want some of this?

131
00:16:26,363 --> 00:16:30,158
- Think about our future.
- You're Mount St. Helensing on me.

132
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:33,119
Why are you forgetting our plans?

133
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:38,249
The plans about you and I opening up
only the coolest club a la the Roxbury.

134
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:43,295
- How? We can't even get in.
- We're letting them not let us in.

135
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:49,301
But no more. It's time we step up
into that sweet-ass world.

136
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:55,348
From now on, the only club
we're going to is the Roxbury.

137
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,184
- We can't ...
- We can. You know why?

138
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:03,313
- We're good looking?
- Very good looking. You especially.

139
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:08,276
Repeat after me:
We can get into the Roxbury.

140
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,155
We can get into the Roxbury.

141
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:17,285
Roxbury .. !

142
00:17:21,372 --> 00:17:26,251
Hey, what's up? You want some
of this? How about a little of that?

143
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:32,257
She starts to smell them.
She thought they were real plants!

144
00:17:35,426 --> 00:17:39,180
- Hello?
- What's up?

145
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:44,268
The Sandersons are here to see
your mother's new chin. Get dressed.

146
00:17:44,393 --> 00:17:49,314
- Sorry, we're a bit busy tonight.
- Steve? I'll be right back.

147
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:55,278
I like your bathing suit. You have
really good muscle definition.

148
00:17:55,361 --> 00:18:00,241
Most Americans don't wear revealing
bathing suits. Very European of you.

149
00:18:00,366 --> 00:18:05,287
It's really sexy and I have
a really good taste in what's sexy.

150
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:11,292
- Steve!
- Whatever, Emily.

151
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:27,182
Good.

152
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:31,144
What's going on ..?

153
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:36,274
Are you from out of town ..?

154
00:19:07,386 --> 00:19:12,265
When I tell you to do something,
I mean it. Never come in half-naked.

155
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:19,271
- Put some clothes on and come down.
- lsn't on our things-to-do-list.

156
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:24,234
- We have something to do tonight.
- Yes. To get downstairs.

157
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:28,113
I don't want to!

158
00:19:28,363 --> 00:19:32,158
How do I get through
to this individual?

159
00:19:32,408 --> 00:19:35,161
Doug is like a fax machine.

160
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:40,291
Without a cover page, people don't
know where it's coming from.

161
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:46,296
And sometimes you get a busy signal.
That's why you got a redial button.

162
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:51,301
- Actually, I always screw it up ...
- Don't bother. He'll never understand.

163
00:19:51,384 --> 00:19:56,264
I understand very well. You're going
to a new, hot club tonight, right?

164
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:04,271
- But how are you gonna get there?
- What are you doing?

165
00:20:30,378 --> 00:20:34,132
You can take away our phones
and our keys, but not our dreams.

166
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:39,303
'Cos we're, like, sleeping
when we have them.

167
00:20:39,387 --> 00:20:44,266
Later much!

168
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:49,271
Boys, wait. I don't like you leaving
without a phone.

169
00:20:50,355 --> 00:20:53,149
How old are these? How embarrassing.

170
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:58,237
You know, in case of emergency.
Have fun.

171
00:20:58,404 --> 00:21:03,325
- Did Mom get lipstick on me?
- lt looks like you were making out.

172
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:19,298
- How's my hair? Roxbury-good?
- You know it.

173
00:21:19,382 --> 00:21:24,261
I've got to tell you, Steve,
tonight, I can taste it.

174
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:30,267
I can't taste it. I'm so scared right now.
I don't know what to do.

175
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:35,313
- You're mad-cowing on me. Relax.
- I'm nervous.

176
00:21:35,396 --> 00:21:40,276
- It's this pressure to get in.
- You must take control of yourself.

177
00:21:41,402 --> 00:21:46,281
No, you take control.
I'm barely hanging on here.

178
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:52,245
Come on, relax. Think puppies
and candy canes, all right?

179
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:57,291
- Hey, hotlegs. What's going on?
- We'll clean it up later. Don't worry.

180
00:22:00,377 --> 00:22:05,299
I see your Roxbury balloon
and I hate to burst it, -

181
00:22:06,383 --> 00:22:11,304
- but I don't think
our names are on that list.

182
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:13,223
Perfect. "Rites of Passage".

183
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:18,269
Remember? A boy in the jungle
with only a spear to hunt the lion.

184
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:23,148
This van is our spear.
That Roxbury is our lion.

185
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:27,152
- Does the bouncer know about this?
- He's about to find out.

186
00:22:27,402 --> 00:22:29,196
See you next week.

187
00:22:29,404 --> 00:22:34,242
- My good hombre. Remember us?
- Doug and Steve Butabi.

188
00:22:35,368 --> 00:22:39,121
- You're brothers?
- No ... Yes.

189
00:22:39,372 --> 00:22:42,124
- Man!
- Works every time.

190
00:22:42,374 --> 00:22:47,295
Now I remember. You can't come in.

191
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:52,258
What's up, partner?
How are you doing tonight?

192
00:22:52,383 --> 00:22:56,179
Time to play a little softball.

193
00:22:56,387 --> 00:23:01,308
- Hey, good man. How's it going?
- Good. You stilI can't come in.

194
00:23:02,393 --> 00:23:07,314
That's not what my friend told me.
His name is Abraham.

195
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,153
- You don't know him?
- What about his two friends?

196
00:23:14,404 --> 00:23:19,283
George Washington
and George Washington?

197
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:26,248
And George Washington is a little
lonely. Wants to join his buddies.

198
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:33,296
And look who else we've got.
Roosevelt, Roosevelt and Jefferson.

199
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:42,262
Thanks ... Great.

200
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:47,309
- ls that an ATM?
- That's where we drop off videos.

201
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:50,145
- Hello, that's it.
- That was a card store.

202
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:55,316
- That's just Weight Watchers ...
- ATM. That's it.

203
00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:06,118
- Shit. The car.
- What about me?

204
00:24:06,368 --> 00:24:11,289
This racing car is illegal.
All I need is a police report.

205
00:24:12,415 --> 00:24:16,169
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, let me see.

206
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:21,340
Great. They're starting
with the neck injuries. I'm screwed.

207
00:24:23,384 --> 00:24:26,178
Jesus, man.

208
00:24:26,386 --> 00:24:31,307
- Sorry about your van.
- No way. Richard Grieco!

209
00:24:32,392 --> 00:24:37,313
- We saw you at the Roxbury.
- Right. So what do you want to do?

210
00:24:38,397 --> 00:24:43,277
- Go to the Roxbury again.
- We couldn't get in.

211
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,240
You want me to get you
into the Roxbury? Great. Follow me.

212
00:24:51,368 --> 00:24:54,162
- Amazing.
- lt all comes from within.

213
00:24:54,412 --> 00:24:58,165
He felt it because he's an actor.

214
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:03,337
We gotta make a stop at the Roxbury.
I just don't want a lawsuit.

215
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:22,229
Oh, my God, this is the most
amazing place I've ever been.

216
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:28,235
This is the coatroom.
The club's in there.

217
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:34,240
What's up ..?

218
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:40,287
- Get a hold of yourself.
- It's hottie overload in here.

219
00:25:40,412 --> 00:25:45,334
- Just pace yourself.
- What's up? Two, three, four.

220
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:50,297
What's up? Two, three, four ...

221
00:25:52,382 --> 00:25:55,176
- Sweet!
- Sweet!

222
00:25:55,385 --> 00:25:58,137
Richie, good to see you. Get over here.

223
00:25:58,387 --> 00:26:03,267
- The place is kicking.
- Jumping like "21 Jump Street".

224
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:09,272
Who are your friends?

225
00:26:17,363 --> 00:26:20,157
- The owner.
- The man we want to be.

226
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:25,329
- I thought we wanted to be Grieco.
- Professionally, it's this guy.

227
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:33,336
Dooey, my main man. I love
this man. Meet the Butabi brothers.

228
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:39,300
These are good boys.
Did you grab my ass?

229
00:26:40,384 --> 00:26:43,137
- No, sir. I did not grab your ass.
- It's okay if you did.

230
00:26:43,387 --> 00:26:48,225
I understand. It's just that
you're barking up the wrong tree.

231
00:26:51,394 --> 00:26:54,147
- You guys come here a lot?
- All the time.

232
00:26:54,397 --> 00:26:58,150
- But we've never been inside.
- Watch what you're saying.

233
00:26:58,401 --> 00:27:03,322
So, is Johnny Depp meeting you here?

234
00:27:04,406 --> 00:27:08,160
No.

235
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:13,331
All right ... Listen, Bennie,
see you later. See you, guys.

236
00:27:14,374 --> 00:27:19,295
- See you, Richard Grieco.
- See you, Grieco's lady.

237
00:27:20,379 --> 00:27:25,300
I'm honoured to shoot the shit with
the owner of the club of all clubs.

238
00:27:26,343 --> 00:27:31,264
- And we're proficient club hoppers.
- We usually go to the Mudd Club.

239
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:36,144
- That place is rank.
- They let any asswad in the door.

240
00:27:36,394 --> 00:27:40,147
- I own that place also.
- It's a really good location, though.

241
00:27:40,397 --> 00:27:45,319
No, you're right. One day
you're hot, the next day you're not.

242
00:27:49,406 --> 00:27:53,159
Actually, I had an idea for a club.

243
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:57,163
- Wait. Did you grab my ass?
- No.

244
00:27:57,371 --> 00:28:02,293
- Do you want to?
- No. Should I?

245
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:08,089
Okay. Continue.

246
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:13,261
People waiting outside are bummed,
'cos they're trying to get in.

247
00:28:14,345 --> 00:28:18,140
What if the outside of the club
looked like the inside?

248
00:28:18,391 --> 00:28:23,312
With couches and music and all that.
But then on the inside ...

249
00:28:24,396 --> 00:28:28,150
... it looks like the street.
You know, cars and signs.

250
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,321
The outside is the inside
and the inside is the outside.

251
00:28:33,404 --> 00:28:36,157
Doesn't that blow your mind?

252
00:28:36,407 --> 00:28:41,328
- What about that guy?
- Owns a restaurant. One.

253
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:46,249
- Boy, has this place gone downhill.
- No one over six figures. Let's go.

254
00:28:47,376 --> 00:28:51,129
- Wait. That's that Zadir guy.
- Who are those guys with him?

255
00:28:51,337 --> 00:28:56,259
If they're with Zadir,
they've got to be worth something.

256
00:28:56,384 --> 00:28:59,136
Great. Let's work.

257
00:28:59,387 --> 00:29:03,140
- Tell him about the vampire idea.
- That's a dumb idea.

258
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,143
I have to say hello to Jim Carrey.

259
00:29:06,393 --> 00:29:09,145
Come here,
you pet detective bastard.

260
00:29:09,396 --> 00:29:14,275
"Smoking", you crazy son of a bitch.

261
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,321
- Was I too pushy? Did I speak well?
- You were totally articulate.

262
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:24,284
It's hard to pitch in a nightclub.
The music is way too loud in here.

263
00:29:24,368 --> 00:29:29,289
We have to get a meeting. Steve ..?

264
00:29:41,383 --> 00:29:44,136
- You want to dance?
- Yes.

265
00:29:44,386 --> 00:29:48,140
- All right. Take it easy.
- She said yes.

266
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:53,311
Hotties wanna shake it. Come on.

267
00:31:55,381 --> 00:32:00,261
That's some good ass-grabbing
going on there.

268
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:09,144
1 980. Good year.

269
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:13,189
Excellent year. Devo had a huge hit.

270
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:18,277
- And "Joanie Loves Chachi" started.
- Chachi gives a fuck about Joanie.

271
00:32:21,363 --> 00:32:26,243
Cambi makes a good point.
But tonight we have some fun.

272
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:31,289
- Sweet suds, Mr. Zadir.
- But you know what makes a party?

273
00:32:31,372 --> 00:32:35,126
- Fluffy whip.
- But not putting it on stuff.

274
00:32:35,376 --> 00:32:40,256
You press the little white nozzle
and you suck on it. It's fun.

275
00:32:41,382 --> 00:32:46,261
- You mean, like, nitrous oxide?
- No. What is that?

276
00:32:47,387 --> 00:32:51,141
Dooey, we have to stop and get
some fluffy whip for the party.

277
00:32:51,391 --> 00:32:55,144
- Yes, sir.
- lt has to be in a can.

278
00:32:55,395 --> 00:32:57,230
He can't hear you.

279
00:32:57,438 --> 00:33:02,276
Hey, Dooey, tell your mom
I had a nice time last night.

280
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:06,154
- And your dad.
- What?

281
00:33:06,363 --> 00:33:10,158
- I mean, your sister.
- Good one!

282
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:14,120
- Only in a Limo.
- We nailed him.

283
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:19,291
Disco-dicks.

284
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:24,254
- And that alien was Robin Williams.
- I'll be right back.

285
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:29,301
- It's my boss's card.
- I'll take care of that.

286
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:36,307
- Operator 238, please.
- Hello, Doug.

287
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:41,312
- Guess where we went tonight.
- The One-Stop Market on Ventura?

288
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:47,150
No, I mean before that,
you sly, little credit vixen.

289
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:52,238
I give up, you nasty card-swiper.

290
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:57,285
- The Roxbury. Come out some time.
- I would.

291
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,121
But then who would approve
all the money you spend?

292
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:05,292
- You're always thinking of me.
- The card's good. Bye, Doug.

293
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:14,258
She approved. Approved.

294
00:34:17,428 --> 00:34:22,266
- Sweet-ass dwelling, Mr. Zadir.
- It's a place to hang my hat.

295
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,239
Look. A hundred thousand dollar
sound system, and nobody's dancing.

296
00:34:39,365 --> 00:34:44,244
If I may congest, the pool is taking
up the prime dancing real estate.

297
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:49,291
If you put glass over the pool,
it would be like dancing on water.

298
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:55,171
- And people love to do that.
- Let's not talk business now.

299
00:34:55,421 --> 00:34:58,174
Let's set up a meeting.

300
00:34:58,424 --> 00:35:03,345
Anna Nicole? Put something on.
You're making us sick.

301
00:35:03,387 --> 00:35:06,139
Meeting!

302
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,142
- Let's mingle.
- Right.

303
00:35:09,392 --> 00:35:14,272
This ltalian food tastes so good.
It's, like, Mexican.

304
00:35:14,355 --> 00:35:17,149
- Could you pass me a towel, please?
- Good. How are you?

305
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:22,237
- They're right behind you.
- BMW ... Vanilla, mostly.

306
00:35:23,363 --> 00:35:26,116
- There you are.
- We got scared.

307
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:30,120
- Of who? We'll kick his ass.
- No.

308
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:34,123
We got scared
somebody stole you away from us.

309
00:35:34,374 --> 00:35:37,168
Oh, okay.

310
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:41,171
Like some other girls
would steal us away ...

311
00:35:41,422 --> 00:35:46,259
Oh, right. Oh!

312
00:35:48,386 --> 00:35:53,308
So, do you guys wanna go some place
we can be alone?

313
00:35:53,391 --> 00:35:57,144
No ... Yes! Oh, man.

314
00:35:57,353 --> 00:36:02,232
- Why does it taste so sweet?
- 'Cos it's like candy.

315
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,240
These are real.
They'll be dead in a week.

316
00:36:11,366 --> 00:36:16,287
You know what I always thought
would make a cool 'Twilight Zone"?

317
00:36:17,413 --> 00:36:20,166
Like, we see a picture
of this lady, -

318
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:25,337
- but to this lady, are we just
a picture of us? Ever think of that?

319
00:36:26,421 --> 00:36:29,132
No.

320
00:36:29,382 --> 00:36:32,135
Why don't you come over here?

321
00:36:32,385 --> 00:36:37,306
Vivica, you know what I heard
when I first met you?

322
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:42,269
What?

323
00:36:46,356 --> 00:36:49,150
- What are you doing?
- That's an ambulance.

324
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:54,238
Coming to take me away.
The sight of you stopped my heart.

325
00:36:55,364 --> 00:37:00,286
Cambi, do you like blueberries
or strawberries?

326
00:37:02,413 --> 00:37:07,334
I wanna know what kind of pancakes
to order you in the morning.

327
00:37:09,377 --> 00:37:14,257
Steve!

328
00:37:16,384 --> 00:37:20,137
- I was wondering ...
- What are you doing?

329
00:37:20,387 --> 00:37:25,309
Checking your label.
Just as I thought. Made in heaven.

330
00:37:26,351 --> 00:37:29,187
Doug. You've gotten past
the opening lines.

331
00:37:29,396 --> 00:37:34,233
- ls that a mirror in your pocket?
- What?

332
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:39,155
I could see myseIf in your pants.

333
00:37:39,405 --> 00:37:44,284
If I said you had a nice body,
would you hold it against me?

334
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:53,293
I was there. I was, like, "Emilio!"
And Doug was going cra ...

335
00:37:54,377 --> 00:37:59,298
And Steve was, like, "Emilio!"
Oh, God, if you were only there.

336
00:38:00,382 --> 00:38:05,304
I feel like a selfish pig, going on
about myself. What about you?

337
00:38:05,387 --> 00:38:09,140
Where are you from?
Any brothers or sisters? Any family?

338
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:12,143
- Pets, what about pets?
- I got a cat.

339
00:38:12,352 --> 00:38:15,146
Really? A cat? lnteresting.

340
00:38:15,396 --> 00:38:20,276
I think of you more as a dog person.
Maybe a Pomeranian. Lhasa Apso.

341
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:25,322
Something small, warm, fuzzy ...

342
00:38:26,406 --> 00:38:28,200
ls this your first time?

343
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:33,288
Yes. lsn't it yours?

344
00:38:34,372 --> 00:38:37,124
- ls this your first time?
- What?

345
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:42,254
Are you serious?
Oh, you're hilarious.

346
00:38:42,379 --> 00:38:47,300
Oh, man. You're funny.
Hey, Steve? You're a funny girl.

347
00:38:50,387 --> 00:38:55,266
All right. Hey, where are you going?

348
00:38:59,395 --> 00:39:04,274
- Oh, my God.
- Did you just? 'Cos I just ...

349
00:39:10,405 --> 00:39:15,284
Not that it hasn't happened before.
lt was okay.

350
00:39:15,368 --> 00:39:20,247
I'm gonna go back in and ...

351
00:39:22,374 --> 00:39:27,295
- Hey, Steve?
- Yeah, Doug?

352
00:39:31,382 --> 00:39:36,262
- You got a number.
- We got a number.

353
00:39:44,394 --> 00:39:49,316
I got some great office supplies
for our new nightclub business.

354
00:39:49,399 --> 00:39:53,152
Post-lt notes to annotate important
documents.

355
00:39:53,403 --> 00:39:57,114
Little ones. You write smaller than
me. Mugs with our names on them.

356
00:39:57,365 --> 00:40:01,118
Yours say Doug.
Did you call Mr. Zadir?

357
00:40:01,368 --> 00:40:06,248
Before you talk to a man like Mr. Zadir,
you have to have a plan of attack.

358
00:40:07,374 --> 00:40:12,253
I'd like to schedule a meeting.
Can you do ... 1 2:30?

359
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:17,300
Let me see.

360
00:40:20,386 --> 00:40:22,221
- I'm clear.
- You know what?

361
00:40:22,388 --> 00:40:26,141
Let's have a pre-meeting
to brainstorm before our meeting.

362
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:31,312
Yeah, that way we don't
look like idiots at our meeting.

363
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:38,235
- I'm sorry. Register's closed.
- Sorry.

364
00:40:40,362 --> 00:40:45,284
Mr. Butabi,
where's the other cash register?

365
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:52,248
Steve? I was just thinking. Dad
would be really proud of us right now.

366
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:58,254
What are you idiots doing? I pay you
to take money and push a button.

367
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,175
Are your delicate fingers injured?

368
00:41:03,383 --> 00:41:07,179
- We're working our asses off.
- Our weeks filling up quick.

369
00:41:07,387 --> 00:41:11,141
We've made
important business contacts.

370
00:41:11,391 --> 00:41:14,143
Dancing the Macarena
with Donald Trump?

371
00:41:14,394 --> 00:41:18,105
You're always telling us
to do something with our lives.

372
00:41:18,356 --> 00:41:23,277
You never support us or care about
what's important to us, right?

373
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,240
- Yeah ... for the most part.
- Even your brother isn't convinced.

374
00:41:29,407 --> 00:41:34,245
Why? He uses his brain, unlike you.
You're a loser! New policy.

375
00:41:35,413 --> 00:41:40,292
No more clubs.
Yes! Your life is retail.

376
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:44,171
- Go clean the stockroom.
- You know what?

377
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:49,301
Not only will we not clean out
the stockroom, we're out of here!

378
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:55,306
What about the stockroom?

379
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:58,142
We don't need you.
We made huge-ass contacts last night.

380
00:41:58,392 --> 00:42:02,104
Plus we met these girls, Dad.

381
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:06,108
We'll make it without you.
You'lI see.

382
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:11,279
I'lI see when you come home, begging
for food and shelter. Morons!

383
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:16,284
Steve? You're an ass, Doug.
You want to go to the beach later?

384
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:22,164
I know a beach where you don't have
to wear a bathing suit.

385
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:27,335
- Plus with my milky white skin ...
- This is a major family crisis.

386
00:42:38,387 --> 00:42:43,267
Just give me a call if you wanna
go out. Or just call me anyway.

387
00:43:21,385 --> 00:43:25,097
You notice we forgot to ask her
something. That's weird.

388
00:43:25,347 --> 00:43:30,226
We're in serious relationships right
now, and our ladies can trust us.

389
00:43:30,352 --> 00:43:35,273
Why go out for burgers,
when you got steak at home?

390
00:43:44,406 --> 00:43:48,160
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, fine.

391
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:52,163
- Doug and Steve Butabi.
- You're brothers?

392
00:43:52,413 --> 00:43:57,293
- We can't get into that right now.
- Your names are not on the list.

393
00:43:58,377 --> 00:44:00,212
We have a meeting.

394
00:44:00,379 --> 00:44:05,259
- Doug, Mr. Zadir!
- Security.

395
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:12,140
- Dooey ... Yeah. Up top.
- Main man.

396
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:17,311
- Raging party last night.
- ls that what my mother told you?

397
00:44:17,395 --> 00:44:21,148
- What?
- The fluffy whip was a big hit.

398
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:26,278
- I was sent out looking for more.
- You, sir, are a party animal.

399
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:31,324
It's been great spending quality
time, but we're meeting Mr. Zadir.

400
00:44:31,408 --> 00:44:35,161
Zadir was drunk last night.
He doesn't even remember you.

401
00:44:35,411 --> 00:44:40,291
You think you're the first losers
I've had to get rid of on a Monday?

402
00:44:40,374 --> 00:44:45,295
- Are we being blown off?
- Actually, you're being kicked out.

403
00:44:55,346 --> 00:45:00,267
That doesn't feel good at all ...

404
00:45:00,392 --> 00:45:04,146
- What's going on?
- Just some trespassers.

405
00:45:04,396 --> 00:45:09,317
- And the boys from last night?
- I haven't located them yet.

406
00:45:10,402 --> 00:45:13,154
Dooey, did you just grab my ass?

407
00:45:13,404 --> 00:45:18,284
From where I'm standing,
that's a physical impossibility.

408
00:45:18,409 --> 00:45:23,288
I know your tricks, Dooey.

409
00:45:33,381 --> 00:45:37,134
Maybe we should just go back to work.

410
00:45:37,385 --> 00:45:42,264
Maybe we should go to college, not
put gel in our hair and wear jeans!

411
00:45:42,389 --> 00:45:47,310
- Let's do that, Steve!
- Sorry.

412
00:45:51,397 --> 00:45:55,151
Cambi's number.

413
00:45:55,401 --> 00:46:00,281
- We had a pretty sweet time, right?
- Sweet-ass time.

414
00:46:16,379 --> 00:46:20,132
So you do travel to places
other than Japan.

415
00:46:20,382 --> 00:46:25,304
- These hotties are sweet.
- Sweet ass sweet.

416
00:46:25,387 --> 00:46:29,140
- Who is it?
- Just a bunch of pound signs.

417
00:46:29,391 --> 00:46:34,270
- Are you doing it right?
- You have to hit the pound sign.

418
00:46:36,397 --> 00:46:41,318
You have to put in our number
and then hit the pound sign.

419
00:46:43,404 --> 00:46:46,156
Excuse me, Bill Nye, the science guy.

420
00:46:46,406 --> 00:46:51,286
That's a sweet show, too.

421
00:46:52,328 --> 00:46:57,291
Cambi, it's your boyfriend.
Look, I need to see you.

422
00:46:58,376 --> 00:47:02,129
- I'm at the Skybar.
- We'll be rig there.

423
00:47:02,379 --> 00:47:07,300
- Nice.
- I was focused the whole time.

424
00:47:07,384 --> 00:47:11,137
Did you have a good time last night?

425
00:47:11,387 --> 00:47:15,141
I had a great time.
I think we've reached a point -

426
00:47:15,391 --> 00:47:19,145
- where I can call you Viv
and leave out the "ica".

427
00:47:19,395 --> 00:47:24,274
You wanna hang out
or do what we did last night?

428
00:47:24,399 --> 00:47:29,321
- Or eat, then do what we did?
- Sounds good.

429
00:47:30,363 --> 00:47:35,243
- Have your boarding passes ready.
- You'lI have to check your bag.

430
00:47:36,369 --> 00:47:41,290
The movie on this flight will be ...
I can't think of any more.

431
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:48,255
- Where's your car?
- Our dad got mad, took it away.

432
00:47:49,381 --> 00:47:54,260
We used to work for him, but we quit
today. Actually, we're unemployed.

433
00:47:55,386 --> 00:48:00,266
- You don't work with Mr. Zadir?
- We just met him last night.

434
00:48:00,391 --> 00:48:05,312
- We will be. So no, but yes.
- If we ever get to see him again.

435
00:48:11,443 --> 00:48:16,280
- You don't need boarding passes.
- Get away from us.

436
00:48:16,364 --> 00:48:20,159
- You guys are a big waste of time.
- Como what?

437
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:25,289
- Steve, you're a jerkoff.
- I'm glad you shared that with me.

438
00:48:25,372 --> 00:48:30,251
- It's a big step for both of us.
- Consider last night a favor.

439
00:48:30,377 --> 00:48:34,130
Now do us a favor.
Never talk to us again!

440
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,133
- What did we do? We'll change.
- You can't change.

441
00:48:37,383 --> 00:48:41,136
You are ugly, pathetic losers.

442
00:48:41,387 --> 00:48:46,266
I can't believe we actually had sex
with these asswads!

443
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:51,312
That's the problem. Poor schmucks
look just the same as rich schmucks.

444
00:49:04,366 --> 00:49:09,287
- No ... Yes ...
- This is the worst day of my life.

445
00:49:09,371 --> 00:49:13,124
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't talk to me right now.

446
00:49:13,374 --> 00:49:16,127
I don't know how to respond to that.

447
00:49:16,377 --> 00:49:21,298
Big surprise. You don't know how to
work the clubs, talk to the ladies.

448
00:49:23,383 --> 00:49:28,263
You only know how to ask me
how to do everything!

449
00:49:28,388 --> 00:49:32,142
That's why everything has gone
wrong. You're holding me back.

450
00:49:32,392 --> 00:49:37,355
You're like this thing tied to my
leg, this dragging thing on a chain.

451
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:45,153
- A lead weight?
- Yes, thank you. But not anymore!

452
00:49:45,362 --> 00:49:48,156
Nothing. That's all. Nothing.

453
00:49:48,365 --> 00:49:53,286
You can't blame me. Today was just
a series of random events gone awry.

454
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:59,291
Maybe they wouldn't go awry
if I had someone next to me with a brain!

455
00:50:00,376 --> 00:50:05,297
You know what? Dad was right.
You are a loser.

456
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:11,302
You know what, Steve?
I lied. You're not good looking.

457
00:50:12,387 --> 00:50:16,182
Did you say something? I can't hear
things from that low to the ground.

458
00:50:16,432 --> 00:50:21,312
- Consider me your ex-brother.
- I don't care.

459
00:50:21,395 --> 00:50:25,148
Care about this?
You want the real thing?

460
00:50:25,357 --> 00:50:27,192
- Do you want ..?
- Stop talking to me.

461
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:32,238
Fine. My pleasure.

462
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:17,280
Little Post-lts, you little idiot.

463
00:51:18,364 --> 00:51:23,285
Get out, 'cos I hate you.

464
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:35,296
- You should take a lesson from it.
- Grieco.

465
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:04,239
- You'll be very happy with these.
- How long do they last?

466
00:52:05,365 --> 00:52:09,119
They last forever. They're silk.
They'll always be in bloom.

467
00:52:09,369 --> 00:52:14,290
They'll never die, never change.
Never say you're not good looking.

468
00:52:16,417 --> 00:52:21,338
They'll always be in your room, not
suddenly move to the guest house.

469
00:52:22,423 --> 00:52:27,302
Something has come up. Excuse me.

470
00:52:27,385 --> 00:52:32,265
- All the customers are depressed.
- It's just that I miss Doug.

471
00:52:33,391 --> 00:52:37,144
- He's in the guest house. It's a mansion.
- There's no cable.

472
00:52:37,353 --> 00:52:42,232
- Yes, there is. They have Cinemax.
- But there's no HBO. God!

473
00:52:46,361 --> 00:52:50,115
- Feel it right here. Squeeze.
- Hey, Steve.

474
00:52:50,365 --> 00:52:54,160
I heard about your brother.

475
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:59,331
- So when are we gonna go out?
- I know a place with spinach wraps.

476
00:52:59,415 --> 00:53:04,294
I know you've had you heart set on
this, but the truth is, I'm a rebel.

477
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:09,132
You're like this
sweet-girl-from-next-door type.

478
00:53:09,382 --> 00:53:14,262
I go to college. Translation: Drunken
orgies with occasional Cliff notes.

479
00:53:16,389 --> 00:53:21,268
lt sounds good, but I just got out
of this very serious relationship.

480
00:53:21,352 --> 00:53:25,147
I have to nurse my emotional wounds.

481
00:53:25,355 --> 00:53:29,150
That could take till ... Saturday.

482
00:53:29,401 --> 00:53:34,238
That's perfect. Your dad got us tickets
for David Copperfield this Saturday.

483
00:53:34,405 --> 00:53:39,326
It's gonna be so much fun
to see things appear and disappear.

484
00:53:44,414 --> 00:53:49,294
I'lI see you.

485
00:53:51,379 --> 00:53:56,259
- Oh, man. Great glutes.
- I don't care.

486
00:54:22,408 --> 00:54:27,329
- That's expensive.
- Gotta go.

487
00:54:28,413 --> 00:54:33,293
Who decorates like this?
Steve, come on.

488
00:55:03,403 --> 00:55:08,283
"Business. Human Relationships
in Management."

489
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:13,121
"Covers the development of ..."

490
00:55:13,371 --> 00:55:17,124
Here's one. "Business Computer
Systems." That's a good one.

491
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:22,254
Machines are Doug's thing.
I'm more of a people person.

492
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:28,260
A business man must have knowledge
of computers. Come on.

493
00:55:29,344 --> 00:55:34,265
Here's another one.
"Venture Management."

494
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:39,311
Gosh, Emily, school?
I'lI have to read, and homework ...

495
00:55:40,396 --> 00:55:44,149
Teachers saying: "Would you share
that with the rest of the class?"

496
00:55:44,399 --> 00:55:47,152
Do you want me to be less horny?

497
00:55:47,402 --> 00:55:52,282
- No, that wouldn't be good.
- Look, here's what we do.

498
00:55:52,407 --> 00:55:57,286
First, we combine the stores, okay?
Then we can add the furniture.

499
00:55:59,371 --> 00:56:02,124
Recliners and sofa beds ...

500
00:56:02,374 --> 00:56:06,128
- And end tables and ...
- Chairs.

501
00:56:06,378 --> 00:56:11,299
- Oh, yes, chairs.
- Ottomans.

502
00:56:11,382 --> 00:56:16,262
Yes, ottomans. We're gonna be bigger
than lkea ... Home Depot.

503
00:56:21,392 --> 00:56:26,271
lkea!

504
00:56:34,404 --> 00:56:39,283
I think we're moving way too fast.
You're talking like we're married.

505
00:56:41,368 --> 00:56:46,248
Oh, Steve.
You just made me so happy.

506
00:56:46,373 --> 00:56:50,126
What? No, I don't mean that.

507
00:56:50,377 --> 00:56:55,339
It's just that I don't ...

508
00:56:58,384 --> 00:57:03,305
Okay.

509
00:57:12,397 --> 00:57:17,276
Doug, if I'm not mistaken,
this place has got it going on!

510
00:57:18,361 --> 00:57:22,114
I owe you big time for inviting me.

511
00:57:22,364 --> 00:57:27,285
Who wants to dance?
I call this one the sprinkler.

512
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:34,250
You think it would be okay to wear
this to your brother's wedding?

513
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:39,338
Your brother's wedding, man.
What are you gonna wear?

514
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:44,259
You have to hand it to Steve.
That Emily is the perfect woman.

515
00:57:44,384 --> 00:57:49,306
Strong legs, tight stomach,
positive mental attitude ...

516
00:57:49,389 --> 00:57:54,268
- She can really keep you on track.
- Shut up .. ! ldiot.

517
00:57:57,396 --> 00:58:01,108
Just because you and your brother
are having problems, -

518
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:06,238
- that's no reason to refer to my
intellect in a diminutive manner.

519
00:58:07,364 --> 00:58:12,285
I'm sorry. It's just ...

520
00:58:12,368 --> 00:58:16,164
Can we not talk
about my brother for a second?

521
00:58:16,414 --> 00:58:21,335
- 1 0-4. Boundary set.
- Thank you.

522
00:58:21,377 --> 00:58:26,256
I'm having a hell of a time.

523
00:58:32,387 --> 00:58:37,308
At this moment, I want to make
a toast to Steve and Emily, -

524
00:58:37,391 --> 00:58:42,229
- who after tomorrow
will be Mr. and Mrs. Steven Butabi.

525
00:58:42,354 --> 00:58:46,108
- Emily Sanderson-Butabi.
- Whoever.

526
00:58:46,358 --> 00:58:51,279
I would like to thank my parents,
who came in all the way from Maine.

527
00:58:54,407 --> 00:58:59,328
- Despite Mom's sciatica.
- Terrific, sir.

528
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:05,334
And the Butabis, who came in
all the way from Yayman.

529
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:10,255
- Yemen.
- And that's not the only union.

530
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:15,301
- We got a new lamp-plant store.
- Plant-lamp store. Much better.

531
00:59:16,385 --> 00:59:20,139
- Seriously, it sounds better.
- Steve?

532
00:59:20,389 --> 00:59:23,100
You want to make a toast?

533
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:28,230
I think you should make a toast.
All the men are making toasts.

534
00:59:31,399 --> 00:59:36,237
Okay, I just want to say,
"What's up, Grandma, Grandpa?"

535
00:59:37,405 --> 00:59:42,284
And to the other two old people,
"What's up?"

536
00:59:42,409 --> 00:59:46,163
- Yeah, you.
- Very nice.

537
00:59:46,413 --> 00:59:51,334
Steve is thrilled
that this family's coming together.

538
00:59:51,376 --> 00:59:56,255
I'd like to show you some of our
business plans for after the merger.

539
01:00:01,385 --> 01:00:06,223
Dad? ls there any way
we can cancel this whole thing?

540
01:00:06,348 --> 01:00:11,269
- Yes ... No!
- That is so funny.

541
01:00:12,395 --> 01:00:17,316
But it's like Emily turned out to be
this whole different other person.

542
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,152
Let me explain something.

543
01:00:20,402 --> 01:00:25,324
The caterer has been paid.
Your grandparents came.

544
01:00:25,407 --> 01:00:29,160
All men are nervous
the night before their wedding.

545
01:00:29,411 --> 01:00:34,290
All guys are nervous and kind of
hope she eats a can of botulism?

546
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:41,297
She could hang out with a deer and
accidentally be shot by a hunter.

547
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:45,133
You know, when she's sleeping she
makes that nose whistle sound, -

548
01:00:45,342 --> 01:00:50,221
- and you want to ram her toothbrush
up her nostril into her skull.

549
01:00:53,391 --> 01:00:58,270
These are perfectly normal feelings.

550
01:01:04,401 --> 01:01:09,322
Doug, are you there? It's Steve.

551
01:01:18,372 --> 01:01:23,293
Hi, you've reached Doug Butabi.
I'm outside living it up.

552
01:01:23,377 --> 01:01:26,129
Unlike my pussywhipped brother -

553
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:31,301
- who's too busy throwing his life away
for Emily. Beep.

554
01:01:31,342 --> 01:01:36,264
Doug? Sorry I missed you.
I guess I'm getting married -

555
01:01:36,389 --> 01:01:41,310
- and I'm just wondering
if you wanted to be my best man.

556
01:01:42,394 --> 01:01:44,188
Give me a call or page me.

557
01:01:44,396 --> 01:01:49,317
I'm in our room still
across from the pool.

558
01:01:49,401 --> 01:01:54,280
See you.

559
01:01:58,409 --> 01:02:03,288
- Let's go over this one more time.
- I know my duties as best man.

560
01:02:03,372 --> 01:02:08,251
I walk down the aisle.
I stand next to you.

561
01:02:08,376 --> 01:02:12,088
- I settle interwedding skirmishes.
- No, no ...

562
01:02:12,338 --> 01:02:17,301
You're the best man. Not the wedding
bouncer. You just back me up.

563
01:02:18,386 --> 01:02:23,307
Like, if things get too heavy,
I step in like a spotter.

564
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:26,143
- Yeah, right.
- Thanks, man.

565
01:02:26,393 --> 01:02:31,314
Let's go. We're ready, let's go.

566
01:02:32,398 --> 01:02:37,320
Do you want your kid blessed or not?

567
01:02:38,404 --> 01:02:43,325
- Richard Grieco. You know Steve?
- I just don't want to be sued.

568
01:02:44,368 --> 01:02:49,289
No, listen to me. You can't get your
kid confirmed for less than $1 50.

569
01:02:49,372 --> 01:02:53,084
You want your kid blessed,
you call me.

570
01:02:53,334 --> 01:02:58,255
Dad, I didn't have a bachelor party.
That's a major part of a wedding.

571
01:03:00,382 --> 01:03:05,304
So could we delay a couple of hours
so that we could go to a strip club?

572
01:03:05,387 --> 01:03:10,266
I have to go. Leave me a message.

573
01:03:11,392 --> 01:03:15,146
Hey ... Steve getting married.
You're the man!

574
01:03:15,396 --> 01:03:20,276
Shut up, Craig. I'm walking
down the aisle, you dick!

575
01:03:21,402 --> 01:03:26,281
I told you to wear white.
Grandma, get off the phone.

576
01:03:40,377 --> 01:03:43,130
Dearly beloved. We're gathered
here today to join ...

577
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:48,260
Did we already start? Oh.

578
01:03:48,385 --> 01:03:53,306
I thought there was supposed
to be a buzzer or a whistle or something.

579
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:57,143
... to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony.

580
01:03:57,393 --> 01:04:02,272
But first I understand the bride and
groom have each prepared something.

581
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:10,321
"Dear Steve. They say if you set
something free and it comes back -

582
01:04:11,406 --> 01:04:15,159
- you should love it forever.
Like one of your silk plants, -

583
01:04:15,368 --> 01:04:20,247
- I'll try to stay beautiful. I know
our lives together will be great."

584
01:04:20,372 --> 01:04:24,126
"Just like when we saw David
Copperfield on our first date."

585
01:04:24,376 --> 01:04:29,297
"Love Emily."

586
01:04:35,386 --> 01:04:39,140
"I used to see you outside
my father's store -

587
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:44,269
- and then we went on some dates
and you let me have sex with you."

588
01:04:52,402 --> 01:04:55,154
Oh, I'm done.

589
01:04:55,363 --> 01:05:00,242
If anyone has reason to believe
that this man or woman -

590
01:05:00,367 --> 01:05:05,289
- should not be married, speak now
or forever hold your peace.

591
01:05:05,372 --> 01:05:10,251
- What's up? From out of town?
- Don't hit on the bridesmaid.

592
01:05:11,377 --> 01:05:16,257
- It's your wedding.
- Wait till after the ceremony.

593
01:05:18,384 --> 01:05:23,305
Do you promise to love Emily for
as long as you both shall live?

594
01:05:23,388 --> 01:05:28,268
My dad already paid the caterer.

595
01:05:29,436 --> 01:05:34,273
Do you promise to love Steven for
as long as you both shall live?

596
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:39,278
- Steven, repeat after me.
- After me.

597
01:05:44,366 --> 01:05:49,287
- With this ring, I thee wed.
- With this ring, I thee wed.

598
01:05:52,373 --> 01:05:55,126
Now, Emily.

599
01:05:55,376 --> 01:06:00,256
With this ring ...

600
01:06:06,386 --> 01:06:11,349
Doug!

601
01:06:13,434 --> 01:06:17,188
- What the hell's he doing here?
- Make him stop.

602
01:06:17,438 --> 01:06:20,149
Turn that music off!

603
01:06:20,357 --> 01:06:25,279
You know
what I paid for this wedding?

604
01:06:25,362 --> 01:06:30,241
Don't do that with your head.
That's so dumb!

605
01:06:30,367 --> 01:06:34,120
- Mr. Butabi, I can't ...
- Keep going. You want to get paid?

606
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:39,291
- You're out of my will!
- I told you he was a jerk!

607
01:06:51,427 --> 01:06:56,307
Emily ... Sorry. I'm not ready yet.

608
01:06:56,432 --> 01:07:01,312
- Steve, stop!
- Nice poem, though. Sorry, Dad.

609
01:07:01,395 --> 01:07:06,274
Steve, come back here!
Don't you leave me. I'm not kidding.

610
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:12,238
Mr. Butabi, as an actor and observer
of human nature, I can tell you -

611
01:07:12,363 --> 01:07:17,285
- that your son is not ready
for this sort of commitment.

612
01:07:20,371 --> 01:07:25,292
- Hello.
- Hey.

613
01:07:30,422 --> 01:07:34,175
- Go ahead, Father.
- What are you doing?

614
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:39,346
Emily, Steve's discipline is lacking
as is his appreciation for you.

615
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:45,310
Now, I can bench press 305 pound,
and my body fat is less than 2%.

616
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:54,235
I am a professional trainer. I also
hope to market my own protein bar.

617
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:59,281
Plus, I've always loved you.

618
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:05,120
Okay. But we should
look into infomercials.

619
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:10,291
- This is a completely new fee. Cool?
- Yeah.

620
01:08:12,418 --> 01:08:17,340
Okay. Dearly beloved,
we're gathered here again today ...

621
01:08:19,425 --> 01:08:24,263
Also, I took Craig clubbing.

622
01:08:24,388 --> 01:08:27,140
That was all right.

623
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:32,270
Plus I rented a lot of videos.
I didn't do much else.

624
01:08:36,357 --> 01:08:41,278
Look, Steve ...

625
01:08:42,363 --> 01:08:47,284
I'm sorry.
I said a lot of bad things before.

626
01:08:49,369 --> 01:08:54,290
I've been thinking ...
You're my brother.

627
01:08:55,416 --> 01:09:00,296
We're brothers,
and when we're together ...

628
01:09:02,423 --> 01:09:07,302
I just ...

629
01:09:07,385 --> 01:09:11,139
You don't drag me down.

630
01:09:11,389 --> 01:09:16,269
I drag me down.

631
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:20,147
And you ...

632
01:09:20,356 --> 01:09:23,150
You complete me.

633
01:09:23,358 --> 01:09:27,112
- Shut up.
- What?

634
01:09:27,362 --> 01:09:32,283
Just shut up.
You had me at "hello".

635
01:09:46,421 --> 01:09:51,301
lt seems to me, you're a bit harder
on Doug than you are on Steve.

636
01:09:54,387 --> 01:09:59,308
It's true. It's just that Doug is
so rebellious. I can't control him.

637
01:10:00,351 --> 01:10:02,186
But rebellious, scrappy, dreamer ...

638
01:10:02,353 --> 01:10:07,274
What other young man
does that remind you of?

639
01:10:08,358 --> 01:10:13,279
- MyseIf as a kid.
- So who are you really fighting with?

640
01:10:15,406 --> 01:10:20,286
Mr. Grieco ...
You see right through me.

641
01:10:34,382 --> 01:10:38,135
I missed this car.
I look good in it.

642
01:10:38,386 --> 01:10:40,179
And you look good also.

643
01:10:40,346 --> 01:10:45,267
Thanks.
Glad you moved back into the room.

644
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:49,145
Dad was cool about the wedding
after his chat with Grieco.

645
01:10:49,354 --> 01:10:54,275
And it really improved
your relationship with him.

646
01:10:58,404 --> 01:11:02,157
- ls that an outside nightclub?
- That's your idea.

647
01:11:02,408 --> 01:11:07,329
Pull over. Let's check it out.

648
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:17,296
- We only let people in on the list.
- We're on the list.

649
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:22,259
- Steve and Doug Butabi.
- Step right in.

650
01:11:24,344 --> 01:11:29,266
- Go right in.
- I guess we should go in then.

651
01:11:32,393 --> 01:11:37,315
- We're gonna go in.
- We're going in.

652
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:43,320
I can't believe we got in.
Sure it wasn't a mistake?

653
01:11:43,403 --> 01:11:48,283
- It's weird to be in here.
- But they stole your idea.

654
01:11:53,371 --> 01:11:58,250
Butabis? I've been looking
all over for you. Come here!

655
01:11:58,376 --> 01:12:02,129
- Mr. Zadir!
- How do you like our club?

656
01:12:02,379 --> 01:12:06,133
- Our club?
- I cut you in. lt was your idea.

657
01:12:06,383 --> 01:12:11,262
- Sweet ass sweet.
- Running a club is hard work.

658
01:12:11,387 --> 01:12:14,140
- Don't worry about it.
- We're workaholics.

659
01:12:14,348 --> 01:12:19,311
Dooey just called from Pismo Beach.
He says he didn't grab your ass.

660
01:12:19,395 --> 01:12:21,188
What is he up to now?

661
01:12:21,397 --> 01:12:26,276
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

662
01:12:26,401 --> 01:12:31,322
- Let's do some business.
- All right.

663
01:12:33,366 --> 01:12:37,119
- Put some cherries on that.
- Nice call.

664
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:42,249
- Mr. Butabi, can you approve this?
- That looks fine and all that.

665
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:46,128
- Hi, Mr. Barntabi.
- It's Butabi, but that's okay.

666
01:12:46,378 --> 01:12:51,299
How's the hair?
Successful-club-owner good?

667
01:12:51,341 --> 01:12:56,262
That voice sounds so familiar.

668
01:12:58,389 --> 01:13:02,142
- Are you ..?
- Doug?

669
01:13:02,393 --> 01:13:07,314
- Credit vixen?
- My God, I can't believe this.

670
01:13:07,397 --> 01:13:10,150
You're even more beautiful
than you sound.

671
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:15,279
- You stopped calling.
- Not because I didn't want to.

672
01:13:16,364 --> 01:13:21,285
Am I what you expected?

673
01:13:21,368 --> 01:13:25,122
I totally approve.

674
01:13:25,372 --> 01:13:30,251
- You're not here with anyone?
- Just my friend.

675
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:34,213
Hottie police officer?

676
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:39,301
I was really looking forward
to meeting you in court on June 6th.

677
01:13:40,386 --> 01:13:45,307
- So, do you guys wanna dance?
- No.

678
01:13:46,391 --> 01:13:50,145
- Yes.
- Yes.

679
01:13:50,395 --> 01:13:55,316
- Oh, I love this song.
- I'm getting kind of sick of it.

680
01:14:37,396 --> 01:14:42,234
I broke the window again.
