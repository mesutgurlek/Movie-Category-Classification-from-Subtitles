that Milly is...

305
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,737
She's at a crossroads
in her life.

306
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,283
Another hard left
and I really...

307
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:37,254
She's like this person
who's too sensitive.
You know what I mean?

308
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,724
She's an innocent.
She's a pushover.

309
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,953
I'm usually not this
in-the-muck-of-it.

310
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,465
I mean, actually,
I consider myself
a reasonably sane mother.

311
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,001
Well, yeah,
it is a crazy love, though.

312
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,869
I mean, who's to say
I wouldn't do the same
for my own kid?

313
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:55,796
Mmm.

314
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:59,274
Excuse me. I'm Jason Grant.
I don't mean to interrupt.

315
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:00,402
I've been waiting
over by the bar,

316
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,937
but I only have so much time
before I have to
get back to work.

317
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,320
DAPHNE: I just wanted to
ask you about your family.

318
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:14,621
Yeah, well, my dad is an
engineer who was always
a closet architect.

319
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,794
And I grew up
with a love of old buildings.
I know what you mean.

320
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:22,726
So I suppose I became
the architect that he always
dreamed of being.

321
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,235
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

322
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,336
Oh, thank you, dear Lord.

323
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,003
Can I order you something?

324
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:34,443
You know, actually it turns
out I'm so not hungry at all.

325
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:38,472
Let me get you the <i>funghi</i>
<i>chitarrina misto.</i> It's the
best-kept secret in the city.

326
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,812
Can we have two orders
of that, please?

327
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,877
And a bottle of the
Castellare Chianti Poggiale.

328
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,151
If you insist, huh?
No, I do, I do.

329
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:52,263
Do you mind my asking why
a man like you hasn't found
a woman already?

330
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,161
Well, I'll admit
I'm a bit of a workaholic.

331
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,293
It's a very important time
in my career right now.

332
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,429
I've found women
but just not the right one.

333
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,440
A lot of great "almosts"
out there.

334
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,738
Oh, yeah, a lot of "almosts."

335
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:06,703
Yeah.

337
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,340
You speak Italian, huh?

338
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,408
No, I fake Italian.

339
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,646
I'd really love to learn it.

340
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,951
You know, Milly happens to be
a phenomenal cook.

341
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,082
She's always wanted to take
a cooking tour of Italy.

342
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,855
Oh, wow, I was gonna
go there this fall.
Really?

343
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,418
But it's a crazy time
for me right now.

344
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,693
My company is celebrating
their tenth anniversary.

345
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:28,755
Oh.

346
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,967
You're gonna need
a caterer then.

347
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:34,164
I mean, those kinds of
occasions should be marked,
don't you think?

348
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,966
You are good. So James Bond.
Yes.

349
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,174
Well, it was a pleasure
to meet you, Daphne Wilder.

350
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:46,240
Well, Jason, my pleasure.

351
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,445
Gotta love a woman
in polka dots.

352
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,387
Not everyone can pull it off.
Thank you.

353
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,449

355
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,822
Oh, my God.

356
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,266
Oh, yes.

357
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,630
And the winner is?

358
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,375
Duh. Hands down,
bachelor number 17.

359
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,932
Him?
Yes.

360
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,901
Oh, I don't trust that guy.

361
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,913
That guy was playing you
like a slide guitar.

362
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,448
He was not.

363
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,314
He's a very stable,
responsible, mature young man.

364
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,750
He has empty eyes.

365
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,914
They were not empty.
And who am I supposed to
choose anyway, huh?

366
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,982
Who do you think is better?
Me.

367
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,553
What?

368
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,153
I like you.

369
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,723
And I have an odd instinct
that I'd like her too.
Maybe I should meet her.

370
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,964
Let me be perfectly honest
with you, okay?

371
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,766
You're a very charming guy,
irresistible, in fact.

372
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,207
And that's why I know
you would be
a horrendous choice

373
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,576
because I'm not looking for
a great affair
for my daughter.

374
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,047
You know, like,
gorgeous musician
who's gonna break her heart.

375
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,549
I'm looking for
a life partner.

376
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:53,812
That's great. Thanks.

377
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:57,878
Yeah, no, I love being reduced
to a cultural cliché.
That's just terrific.

378
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,221
Because only musicians
break people's hearts. Wow.

379
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:02,816
Uh...

380
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,326
It's not the only place
I have them.

381
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,835
Well, look,
you're a great guy.

382
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,963
I hope you have a great life.

383
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,440
But I have to do
what's best for my daughter.

384
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,874
Yeah, of course you do,

385
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,412
but maybe you don't know
what's best for your daughter.

386
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,175
I beg your pardon?

387
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,274
Maybe you do.

388
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,210
Maybe I do.

389
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,978
Nice to meet you, Daphne.

390
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,851
Pleasure. Pleasure.

391
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:49,869
Here we are.

392
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,706
Almost here.

393
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:55,178
Yeah, we've landed.
We're in heaven.
Oh, my God.

394
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,580
Oh, my God. Look. Oh, God.
Mil, look at this.

395
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:03,314
Mom, it's polka dots. It's so
Minnie Mouse. I don't even
know if I like it. Do I?

396
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,753
I'm hearing you hate it.

397
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,257
Me, too.
Oh, please, just try it on.

398
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,725
Why?

399
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,523
Because I said so.

400
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,426
Honey, look,
it might surprise you.

401
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,227
Anyway, you look beautiful
in dresses. In fact,
you know what I think?

402
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,461
I think that you should
wear it to that catered affair
on Sunday.

403
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,902
To work? Mom,
I spill things all the time.

404
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,405
Oh, come on, just try it on.
All right.

405
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,909
Okay. That's incredible.

406
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,843
It's not really me at all.

407
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,075
What are you talking about?
It is totally you.

408
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,014
Well, it's sort of
more you in a way.

409
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:36,077
You know what it is,
it's kind of Aunt Jemima
meets Betty Crocker.

410
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,952
You know, that's ridiculous.

411
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,253
Come on, sweetie,
you know what I'm going to do?

412
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,453
I made up my mind.
I'm going to get it for you.

413
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,189
No, no, no. You're not
getting me this dress.

414
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,754
I don't even like it
and it's absurd for work.

are my mom's recipe.

Fantastic, I recommend
everybody try some.

420
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,232
I love that shade of orchid.

Let's just go ahead
and just shift everything over

00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,726
so it frames the temple doors.

Yeah. That's the perfect spot.

it's a little cold.

00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:10,802
Hello, Jason, this is Bond.

458
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:15,171
James Bond. Call me.
I'm hearing rave reviews.

459
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:30,090
All right, I just pulled up.
I'm walking in.

460
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,459
It's okay. Don't worry.
I'm here, I'm here.

461
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,925
(CAR HONKING)
Sorry, sorry.

462
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,764
No, no, they're not angry.

463
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,667
They're not... Hold on. Sorry.

464
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:43,037
They're just... They're
probably hungry or something.

465
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:47,807
Feed them the spring rolls
from the Adams wedding

466
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,974
and the sauce
from the Levy wedding.

467
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,680
All right, I'm walking in.
Okay, bye.

468
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,681
There's a lot of static
out there.

469
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,444
You can say that again.

470
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,509
There's a lot of static
out there.

471
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,681
You know it's caused
by a lack of humidity
in the air

472
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,782
that causes an imbalance
of the positive and negative
charges.

473
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:39,796
You know, ice cream is known
to cut the static cling
in 98% of most cases.

474
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:42,332
I love ice cream,
but I'm really late to work.

475
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,369
And I'm so sorry.
Nice tattoo, though.

476
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,871
What flavor?

477
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,173
Why don't you get me
your favorite?

478
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,473
Why don't I get your favorite?

479
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:00,877
Okay.

480
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,421
I'll have the Fudgsicle.

481
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,856
Oh, no, no. The Dreamsicle.

482
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,291
Wait. Is that
the tall rainbow one

483
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:12,489
that's really
embarrassing to eat,
but it's really, really good?

484
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:13,755
Okay. Never mind.

485
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:16,596
I will have the Dreamsicly one
that has the green wrapper

486
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,829
with the Japanese writing
on it.

487
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,234
Thank you.

488
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,906
I'm really beginning to feel
like I'm never going to
meet anyone

489
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,077
and it's making me
feel hopeless.

490
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:40,356
Well, as I've said before,
Stuart, Sheila was a huge
loss, but that was 1993.

491
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,222
Oh, it's still so fresh.

492
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,125
This makes me feel like
when I was in the 2nd grade,

493
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:48,097
and I walked around
with a booger in my nose
all day and nobody told me.

494
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,190
Why didn't they tell me?

495
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:52,065
Well, more to the point,
why didn't Sheila tell you
she was unhappy?

496
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,695
Oh, God, this is making me
feel nauseous.

497
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,296
Maybe I should change
my appointment time

498
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:56,897
from Thursdays at 3:00
to Mondays at 1:00.

499
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,533
No, Stuart,
we've tried that before.

500
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,407
You had Fridays at 1:00
and Tuesdays at 11:00.

501
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,343
It really didn't help
your hypoglycemia.

502
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,609
Now let's focus
on where we ended last time.

503
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,275
Meeting new people,

504
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,218
joining an adult-education
class or a book club.

505
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,414
I did go to an
Internet dating service.

506
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,821
Good for you.
That's very brave.

507
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,757
It was a nightmare,
Dr. Wilder-Decker.

508
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:20,127
It made me
want to kill myself,
even more than the last time.

509
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:24,294
Wow. Well, what triggered
those feelings, Stuart?

510
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,426
(GROANS)

511
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:29,769
This mother put an ad out
looking for a mate for her
daughter and I answered it.

512
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,435
A mate for her daughter?

513
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,444
Stuart, some people
really shouldn't have kids.

514
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:37,743
I guess I didn't pass the test
because she made me
feel about this big.

515
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,283
Well, I wouldn't worry
about that, Stuart.

516
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,545
Imagine how screwed up
any daughter of hers would be.

517
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:44,281
And then when I pressed her
as to why I couldn't
meet her precious daughter,

518
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,255
do you know what she said?
I really hear
it didn't go well.

519
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:48,690
"Because I said so.
That's why."

520
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,226
Mother, how could you?
When are you planning
on telling her?

521
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,287
Well, why does
she need to know?

522
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,856
I mean as long as she's happy,
that's all that's important.

523
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,028
And, my goodness, who knows?

524
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,365
This architect could be
the real magilla.

525
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,633

and that is why
he made mothers."

What? That was on
a Hallmark card we gave you,

528
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,212
and Milly thought
it was too corny.

529

Don't you dare tell her,
Maggie, or you and I are gonna
have some serious issues.

you look so beautiful.

wear that dress, though?

the first time.
I know,

00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,012
but don't you think
you ought to mix it up
a little bit?

Well, okay, you know,

00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,066
And to this day...
Okay, okay.

913
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,226
You know what?

914
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:55,135
To be fair, you're reading
a lot into a guy that you've
met for ten minutes.

915
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:59,437
Truth be told,
that Johnny has heartbreak
written all over his face.

916
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:02,967
No, no, no. Truth be told,
you know absolutely
nothing about him.

917
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,207
And know what, Mom? I gotta go
'cause I'm getting
my bangs cut.

918
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,909
What?
No, no, you go ahead.

919
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:08,110
No, that's okay, you go ahead.

920
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,174
Yes.
Fine.

921
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:11,118
Cut your bangs and quit
hiding your incredible eyes.

922
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:13,986
To be truthful, you know
nothing about him.
He's actually a good parent.

923
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,082
Hiding your incredible eyes.
I can't do this.

924
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:20,027
Milly, I love you
and you may be brilliant,
but you're not smart.

925
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:22,395
I just want you to
have a full, beautiful life.

926
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:25,094
Do I not have a life, Mom?
Because I thought
I had a life.

927
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,261
No. No, you have a career,
you have a car

928
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:29,669
and you have a loft
you pay way too much rent for.

929
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,764
That's not a life.

930
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:35,039
Milly, I'm your mother.
I love you enough
to tell you the truth.

931
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:37,910
Your version
of the truth, Mom.
No. No.

932
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:41,508
The truth is, happiness
is a series of choices.

933
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,348
It's not something
that just sort of happens.

934
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,514
One wrong decision
can change your whole life.

935
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,490
There's still time, Mom.

936
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,585
Not if you waste
another minute of it.

937
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:54,961
I mean for you.

938
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:01,994
And I don't say
"great" too much.

939
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,770
MILLY: This is great.
This is great.

940
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:11,341
The view is great.
The night is just so great.

941
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,110
You warm enough?
You wanna go inside?

942
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,515
No, no, no, I'm fine.
I'm nice and toasty.

943
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:16,609
Okay, all right.

944
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:21,624
And don't you just love
my mom's orange blossom
cheesecake? So good.

945
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:23,557
Get a big bite.
Wow.

946
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,086
It's great, right?

947
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:32,193
It's superb, which is
a synonym for great, if you're
ever looking for one.

948
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:37,505
You know, you're cold.
Let's go inside.

949
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:38,939
You get the candle,
I'll get the rest.

950
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,374
Let me grab that.

951
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:42,937
Be careful with that.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

952
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,071
I'm so sorry.

953
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,411
Oh, my gosh, please tell me
where I can get you
another one...

954
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,247
You can't.
It's my great-grandmother's.

955
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,544
Oh, my God. Jason.

956
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:54,555
I don't know
what to say. I'm sorry.

957
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:56,216
Please, I'm just,
I've been so out of it lately.

958
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:59,262
My alarm clock
didn't go off today
and that's why I was late

959
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,593
and I've just been
so stressed with
the Greenberg Bar Mitzvah,

960
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,189
but that's a whole...

961
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:07,765
You just seem really angry.

962
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,101
Nope.

963
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,339
I'm great.

964
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,808
Okay.

965
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:25,446
MILLY: I promise you
they're the best
chocolate soufflés ever.

966
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,149
Well, they better be.
They're worth it.

967
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:28,657
Touchdown.

968
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:31,958
Oh, my gosh, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

969
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,327
Hey, it's all right.
That's all right.

970
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,692
I'm sorry. I bumped
into, like, a parking
meter yesterday

971
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:39,463
and I'm always breaking stuff.

972
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,403
Why are you apologizing?
It isn't even your fault.

973
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:46,169
Lionel, put some shoes on
before you come back
in here, all right?

974
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:50,637
Look, I know he can be a lot
and it gets a little crazy
around here sometimes.

975
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:54,047
But here you are making us
chocolate soufflés
and you're apologizing.

976
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:57,746
Sometimes, I think you let
people make you feel bad
about yourself.

977
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,153
Yeah, like you are right now?

978
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,389
(GRUNTING)

979
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:05,187
What is going on
with us today?

980
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:07,287
We're having an off day,
that's all.

981
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:13,027
What are you doing?
I'm leaving.

982
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:14,798
I'm leaving because
you're miserable

983
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:16,862
and we're having a bad day.
You just admitted it.

984
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,305
No, I said "off day."

985
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,967
And, yes,
we've had better days,

986
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:22,068
and I'm sure we'll have
a few hundred more weird ones

987
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:24,045
if we stay together. So what?

988
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:27,710
Johnny.
Give me your hand.

989
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:30,150
What?
I'm going to
try something here.

990
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:33,948
What are you doing?
Just a little something.

991
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:42,655
Oh.

992
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,859
The soufflés are done.
No, the timer didn't go off.

993
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,098
No, no. I feel it.
I feel it. Watch.

994
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:00,108
Those look beautiful.
Thank you.

995
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:02,913
The one thing I can
actually do right.

996
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:07,688
You have perfect timing.
Thank you.

997
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:09,856
Come here.

998
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,124
Don't apologize.

999
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,999
He has this way
of calming me down.

1000
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,436
A huge plus.
Yeah.

1001
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:24,767
But then the whole
Lionel thing.

1002
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:29,039
I just worry and wonder,
would I be a good mother
to him?

1003
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:31,103
Don't worry.
It's not genetic.

1004
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:36,277
They've been through
so much, though,

1005
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:40,847
with Lionel's mom, like,
freaking out and splitting
when he was so young.

1006
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,791
I don't know, not that we're
anywhere near talking
about any of this yet.

1007
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:48,228
Just the fact
that you're wondering,
though. God.

1008
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:52,659
I mean the fact is
you don't know either
of these guys that well.

1009
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,427
Who knows if Jason
even wants to have kids?

1010
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:56,836
JASON: Absolutely.

1011
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:58,973
Four kids.

1012
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:00,976
And I wanna name the first
one Charlie after my father

1013
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:02,705
and that works
if it's a boy or a girl.

1014
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:06,613
Then I want to design
a huge Craftsman house
for the whole brood.

1015
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:07,741
The exhibit's in here.

1016
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:11,082
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't let me in the museum.
Too many breakables.

1017
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:13,418
Don't worry. They're insured.

1018
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,024
Hey, listen.

1019
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,054
I'm sorry I lost my temper
with you the other day.

1020
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,223
You felt bad enough already.

1021
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:25,932
I can be a real ass
and I hate that about myself.

1022
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,176
Another family heirloom.

1023
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,645
He buys jewelry.
Well, it's a no-brainer.
He's the one.

1024
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,385
He felt remorse, Mae.
DAPHNE: Well,
that's a lovely quality.

1025
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:52,019
No, he knew
he should feel remorse.
Oh, my God, Milly.

1026
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:53,153
Those empanadas are amazing.

1027
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,960
They're gonna be perfect
for Mom's party.
Oh, my party.

1028
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:59,263
Mom, what about these
for your party?
Oh, shoes, please.

1029
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:02,134
Why are you making
such a big deal
over this dreaded event?

1030
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:04,139
Why are we celebrating
my descent into oblivion?

1031
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,675
Come on, Mom.
It's not that bad.
Snap out of it.

1032
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:11,009
Well, I mean, it is
a milestone, and actually,
I am taking stock of my life

1033
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,743
and trying to find
some peace and quiet
in my old age,

1034
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:17,150
so, Milly, will you please
bring Jason to the party?

1035
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,787
I would just love to meet him.
That's all I'm asking.

1036
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:23,189
I understand,
but isn't it my choice
who I bring?

1037
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,057
I think it is.
Thank you.

1038
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:26,889
All right.

1039
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,424
Okay.

1040
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,492
Oh.

1041
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,729
(DAPHNE MOANING)

1042
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,338
Oh, my God.

1043
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:43,038
Mom, Eli says
that's what I say
right before I...

1044
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,740
No kidding? Me, too.

1045
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:46,111
And, you know, it was funny,

1046
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:48,480
the other night,
we hadn't had sex
in so long, by the third one,

1047
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:50,815
I was setting off
the car alarms
in the neighborhood,

1048
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:52,115
and dogs were barking...

1049
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:54,418
Three? Is that normal?

1050
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,959
Please. Everyone knows
I hold the record
in this family.

1051
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:03,962
Why are you so quiet?

1052
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,663
'Cause she's doing
the Oompa-Loompa
with two guys, Mom.

1053
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:09,728
Stop it.
What?

1054
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:11,270
DAPHNE: Wait a minute.

1055
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:14,138
At this point,
are you doing it
with both of them at once?

1056
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:16,542
No. I'm not. Absolutely not.

1057
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:30,019
Honey, I've been thinking
about your situation
with Jason.

1058
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:33,826
Mom, I didn't ask for this.
It happened to me.

so out of hand
I broke my first bundt cake.

1063
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:13,066
Has anybody seen my G.I. Joe?

1064

Believe me, it's not in here.

1065
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:16,705
I left it on the bed.

1066
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:18,138
...that it happened to you.

1067

We made it.

made it.
MAE: We helped, okay?

1074
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,183
It's really yummy.
I tried some.
All right.

00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:01,583
I'd like to propose a toast.

To the incredibly unique
Daphne Wilder,

1081
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:09,956
the fearless leader of
the Wilder women, who I hope
to someday call family.

1082
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:12,322
You've created
a wonderful family,

1083
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,863
and I hope when my folks
stop through town,

1084
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,695
that Milly'll charm them
as much as she's charmed me.

Thank you so much.

Thank you, thank you.

1090
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,709
What was that exactly?
Did you know
he was gonna do that?

1091
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,709
Did he just propose?
Because I think
he just proposed.

1092
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,048
I think he did.
The question is, to who?

1093
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,714
Maggie, stop being a killjoy.
All right, girls,
what do you think?

1094
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,689
He seems well-read.
He's tall.

1095
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:44,022
Okay, you guys
don't like him at all.
Don't listen to your sisters.

1096
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:46,254
For God's sake, sweetie,
do not listen to them.

1097
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:47,353
Here's what I'm thinking.

1098
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:49,625
I'm thinking his parents
are from Connecticut.

1099
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:50,996
They're a little conservative,

1100
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:53,365
so maybe you should
just wear your pleated skirt.

1101
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:55,870
Just this once, honey?
Stop.

1102
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:58,373
It's just a gesture,
just make them
more comfortable.

1103
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:01,877
I understand it's a gesture
but, Mom,
this is moving very quickly.

1104
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:04,971
He just said
all of this. It's...
Milly, don't fight it.

1105
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:06,208
This is the way
it's supposed to be.

1106
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:07,977
You're just not used
to feeling pursued and adored.

1107
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,318
I hate pleated skirts.

1108
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:13,551
Isn't this about the time
we were going to sing?

1109
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:15,887
That's a great idea.
Come on, Mils.
Yes, yes.

Not bad. What do you
got going, Mom?

Milly? Will you take
the soprano?

1118
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:07,906
You know, that's it.
That's it.

1119
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:10,138
No, no. You're so
out of control.

1120
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,305
What'd I do this time?

1121
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,281
You're forcing me.
Jason's here.
You're making me...

1122
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:15,840
So, Jason, can I get you
another one of these?

1123
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:16,908
Will I need one?

No, no, no.
No, no, no.

1127

You're not gonna go.
You're out of control.
Milly's right.

1128
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:27,061
I don't know how
she can take it.
I can't.
I can't take it anymore.

1129
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:32,124
Well, excuse me for just
one moment here. I thought
that this was my birthday.

1130
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:34,829
My very big, special birthday.

1131
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,531
Yes, Mom. It's your big,
special birthday.

1132
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:37,630
That's how you should remember

1133
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:38,867
you're too old...
Old?

1134
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:41,809
Not too old, but too old
to be doing this to Milly.

1135
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:43,778
You're pushing her
like you pushed her
into Girl Scouts.

1136
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:45,575
Thank you very much.
I'm not ten years old anymore.

00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:46,706
You have to stop.
Yeah.

1138
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:47,977
You have to change
at some point.

1139
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:52,681
Fine. But I just want you
girls to understand something
about motherhood, okay?

1140
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:53,915
Mom.

1141
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,048
Okay?
MAGGIE: Yeah, okay.

1142
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:57,854
I mean, it is the most
impossible love.

1143
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,419
You tell me when it ends.
You tell me when it stops.

1144
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:06,764
All I know is, it's absolutely
fine for me to teach you
how to walk and talk,

1145
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:11,000
and then you grow up and you
head off in the wrong
direction toward a cliff.

1146
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:13,975
And I'm supposed to just
stand there and wave and go,

1147
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:18,537
"Well, kids, good luck.
It's Mom. I'm here."
Well, I can't do that.

1148
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:21,579
What am I supposed to do, huh?

1149
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:26,748
Am I supposed to just put my
feet up at the end of the day
and say to myself,

1150
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:32,693
"Well, you know,
they're on their own
and she says she's fine."

1151
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:33,854
Well, you won't be.

1152
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,591
Just stop it. God damn it.

and you're never gonna change

when you're doing it.

JASON'S MOTHER:
Jason's finally met
such a wonderful girl.

1360
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:13,571
She's so sweet.
She has the loveliest spirit
about her.

1361
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:18,136
But I still can't believe
he found her on the Internet.

1362
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:20,147
Not like in our day.

1363
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:21,580
That somehow reminds me

1364

a phone number
on the bathroom wall.

1365

we should...
Are you dating somebody else?

01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:36,052
What?

1367
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:38,629
I just heard your mom
on the phone talk about

1368
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,964
how you're dating some girl
you met on the Internet.

1369
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:43,402
Oh, it's nothing
like that at all.

1370
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:47,101
I'm surprised
and I don't even know
if I have the right to be,

1371
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:48,904
'cause to be honest,
I feel like I need to tell you

1372
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:52,105
that I'm also dating
somebody else.

1373
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:58,983
Well, first of all, to be
honest, you didn't need to
be so honest.

1374
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:01,886
I'm not seeing anyone but you.

1375
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:06,961
But since we're being honest,
this is something
that I was saving for later.

1376
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:13,427

You sounded just like her
there.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1381

Hey, hey, hey.
What does it matter
how we met?

1382
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,579
You and my mom have been
totally scheming

1383
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:35,850
and now I know exactly
why she pushed me on you.

1384
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,222
Because she was voting
for you. She found you.

1385
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:40,318
Yeah, and it doesn't
take anything away from us.

1386
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:44,024
What matters is that
we did meet and how good
this is between us.

1387
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,157
And the truth of that...

1388

The truth? Where's the truth?
Where's the truth?

1389
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:50,298
Because you've been living
a lie and I've been
lying to you, Jason.

1390
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:51,737
And it doesn't
change anything.

1391
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:53,604
How does that not
change everything?

1392
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:58,009
Because you're here.
I think you already
made your choice.

1393
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,911
But if it helps, I'll say it.

1394
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:03,213
Stop seeing him.
Then you and I can get closer.

1395
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:07,487
Close enough to spend
the rest of our lives
together.

1396
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:09,787
I knew I had you
the day I met you.

1397
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:11,450
How could you know
something like that?

1398
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:12,788
'Cause you were so nervous,

1399
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:16,353
you laughed like a hyena
in that beautiful polka dot
dress of yours.

1400
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:17,591
Really?

Mmm-hmm.

1402

I'll tell you one thing,
though.

1403
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,500
You did not have me
the moment that we met

1404
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:30,169
because I wasn't even sure
that I liked the fact

1405
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:33,578
that your staff talked
about you behind your back
at the dessert table.

1406
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,480
And, excuse me,
but, truth be told,

1407
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:37,108
I didn't like anything
that you ordered for me

1408
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:38,948
on our first date,
except the calamari.

1409
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:41,956
And okay, fine, yes,
it was nice to not have
to think for a change,

1410
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:44,822
but who wants someone
who doesn't think?

1411
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:49,353
Look, and sometimes you laugh
when I cry and say, "Huh?"
when I make perfect sense.

1412
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:54,061
And never, ever, in my life
have I burned a chocolate
soufflé until now

1413
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:55,569
and that, in and of itself,

1414
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:59,164
oh, my God, should have
told me I don't feel
like myself around you.

1415
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:02,699
And I would have decided that
a long time ago
if it weren't for my mother.

1416
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:05,713
Because who wants someone
who laughs like a hyena

1417
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:09,808
in a polka dot dress
that my mother made me buy?

1418
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:14,182
I love that dress.

1419
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:17,714

Well, should I wait?

But I'm suicidal.

1423

feel like when I was
the last pick in kickball...

where we'll begin next week.

after Willie Matthews,

01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:51,926
you would never
lie to me again.

Oh, Milly Woo, Milly Boo.
Stop.

1428
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:57,029
Well, I'm sorry.
Mommy made me promise
not to say anything

1429
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:58,828
or she'd be furious.
Mommy?

1430

I'm feeling rejected by you.
Okay.

1434
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:14,010
And it's bringing up memories
of summer camp

1435
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:17,518
when Jimmy Feldon and
Eric Fishman both transferred
out of my bunk.

1436
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,349
I totally understand, Stuart.

1437
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,618
Come back today
and we'll do a two-hour
session at 3:00 p.m.

1438
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:25,318
Listen, you're right.

1439
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:28,191
I didn't handle this well
and I understand
you feel betrayed.

1440
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:30,857
But, really,
isn't some of this anger
a little misplaced?

1441
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:33,560
No, no, Maggie.
It's placed exactly
where it should be.

1442
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:36,399
And there is plenty to
go around, so don't worry,
Mom will be getting hers.

to empower yourself and leave.

This could be a huge day
for you, Stuart.

1446

I was 13 and no one came
to my bar mitzvah.

I don't get it.

the fact that both of these
guys went along with it.

what you guys
are talking about

very much out of the loop,

<i>Leave me a message.</i>

1503
01:23:11,953 --> 01:23:15,616
<i>Milly? It's your mother,</i>
<i>Daphne Wilder.</i>

1504
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:17,950
<i>Please pick up.</i>

1505
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:20,924
<i>It's been four days.</i>

1506
01:23:23,898 --> 01:23:25,024
<i>Okay.</i>

1507
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:32,363
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

1508
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:33,930
What are... Nothing.

1509
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:36,403
Just do nothing.

1510
01:23:44,419 --> 01:23:45,613
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

1511
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:48,247
<i>Hey, it's Milly.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

1512
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:50,223
<i>Hi, Milly.</i>
<i>This is your mother.</i>

1513
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:54,125
Hopefully, you still have
a mental picture of me.

1514
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:57,323
We have the same hands
and earlobes

1515
01:23:57,432 --> 01:24:00,424
and love of Bauer pottery.

1516
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:04,029
<i>I know that you asked me</i>
<i>not to call you</i>

1517
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:05,728
and I respect that.

1518
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:08,640
<i>I just thought that</i>
<i>you might like to know</i>

1519
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:12,407
that I found Grandma's recipe
for your favorite
Lady Baltimore cake.

1520
01:24:12,847 --> 01:24:14,712
The one from my
third birthday.

1521
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:17,081
The one from
your third birthday.

1522
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:19,277
<i>You know what, Milly?</i>
<i>Okay, you were right</i>
<i>about Johnny.</i>

1523
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:21,151
Obviously,
he has more character.

1524
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:23,554
I mean,
he's really a good guy.

1525
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:28,422
<i>And you should know</i>
<i>that he never saw that ad,</i>

1526
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:30,623
<i>and, in fact,</i>
<i>we met by chance.</i>

1527
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:33,826
He was just an
innocent bystander.

1528
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:41,133
I know that I'm
saying too much.
I've learned my lesson.

1529
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:42,333
Good.

1530
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:46,480
Because, Milly,
it's your life.

1531
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:51,212
Yup, that's right.
That's absolutely right.

1532
01:24:53,488 --> 01:24:56,013
<i>Hey, it's Milly.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

1533
01:24:56,091 --> 01:25:01,085
<i>DAPHNE: I know you're in there</i>
<i>and it's fine with me that</i>
<i>you've chosen not to pick up.</i>

1534
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:06,662
But, Milly,
if you're in any way
still pulled to Johnny,

1535
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:10,500
then please don't let
your pride or our differences

1536
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:12,631
come between you
and getting what you want

1537
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:17,201
otherwise, honey,
you're gonna end up
like some pathetic character

1538
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:19,473
<i>in a Tennessee Williams play.</i>

1539
01:25:20,582 --> 01:25:23,449
Believe me,
I know what I'm talking about.

1540
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:26,946
Okay.

1541
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:49,804
Milly...

1542
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:51,805
<i>Milly?</i>

1543
01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:56,607
I never meant to
hurt you, sweetie.

1544
01:25:57,685 --> 01:26:03,453
And I promise I will never
ever interfere ever again.

1545
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:10,493
<i>I was, I was only, I mean...</i>

1546
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:17,334
I guess
what I'm trying to say is

1547
01:26:21,643 --> 01:26:25,306
that I was just
trying to protect you
from becoming me.

1548
01:26:27,148 --> 01:26:28,672
My sweet girl.

1549
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:34,681
Mom?

1550
01:26:38,426 --> 01:26:39,757
Hi, honey.

1551
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:45,664
I miss you.

1552
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:49,029
I miss you, too.

1553
01:26:58,613 --> 01:27:00,410
Solo on the four chord.

1554
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,854
Alternate the bass line,
will you?

1555
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:15,391
Too late for spring sign-up.

1556
01:27:15,463 --> 01:27:16,953
I've actually been here
before.

1557
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:21,161
I came once on a Tuesday
when it was closed,
and I just wanted to...

1558
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:23,796
You know, I can't hear you.
I'm sorry.

1559
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:26,100
Please.

1560
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:34,413
I miss you.

1561
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:37,916
I miss us

1562
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:40,881
and I'm not seeing anybody.

1563
01:27:40,955 --> 01:27:42,183
That doesn't change
anything for us, Milly.

1564
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:45,658
Yeah, but Johnny, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry,
I'm so deeply sorry,

1565
01:27:45,727 --> 01:27:49,254
and I wish I could find
a less cliché word
for sorry, but...

1566
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:55,703
It was an aberration.
It's not who I am,

1567
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:59,365
and I know
we can't start over,
but maybe we could...

1568
01:28:01,542 --> 01:28:03,976
Maybe we could try this again.

1569
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:09,776
I need to get back up there.

1570
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:28,935
LIONEL: Okay, you're driving
a bus. Seven hundred
and fifty people get on.

1571
01:28:29,003 --> 01:28:30,402
Two get off.

1572
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:32,739
Thirty thousand
seventy-one get on.

1573
01:28:32,807 --> 01:28:34,468
Four hundred and five
get off.

1574
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:37,010
A thousand get on
and nine hundred
and ninety-nine get off.

1575
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:38,602
Get off.

1576
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:41,205
What color are
the bus driver's eyes?

1577
01:28:41,549 --> 01:28:42,675
I don't know.

1578
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:45,742
I said you're driving the bus.
Get it, dummy?

1579
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:47,920
You dummy.

1580
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:49,347
Dummy.

1581
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:52,621
You did say that, Lionel.
That's right. That's so good.

1582
01:28:52,694 --> 01:28:55,288
He did.
That is so great.
That is so great.

1583
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:56,387
Want to hear it again?

1584
01:28:56,464 --> 01:28:57,692
Well, I mean, I don't know.

1585
01:28:57,765 --> 01:29:00,598
Actually, I thought
you really nailed it
that last time, so...

1586
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:03,193
Didn't he?
Just one more time. Please?

1587
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:04,260
Okay.

1588
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:05,704
Okay, you're driving a bus.

1589
01:29:05,773 --> 01:29:08,333
Five people get off.
Six people get on.
Really?

1590
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:11,139
Seven hundred
and seventy-five thousand
get on.

1591
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:12,907
Seven hundred
and thirty-five million
and one...

1592
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:14,447
Oh, no.
Hey, guys.

1593
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:18,248
You know, I forgot
a few things at the market.

1594
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:19,411
I'm just gonna...
I'll be right back.

1595
01:29:19,487 --> 01:29:21,011
Dad, Dad, you got to
hear this punch line.

1596
01:29:21,089 --> 01:29:23,523
Yeah, yeah. You really,
really... You have to
stick around for this.

1597
01:29:23,591 --> 01:29:25,650
Think you got to, Johnny.

1598
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:28,154
LIONEL: Okay, now.
What is it?

1599
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:29,924
You are driving a bus.
Yeah.

1600
01:29:29,997 --> 01:29:32,363
A billon million catrillion
get on.

1601
01:29:32,433 --> 01:29:34,196
I cannot believe
you are here.
You are truly insane.

1602
01:29:34,268 --> 01:29:35,826
Two hundred billion million
get off.

1603
01:29:35,903 --> 01:29:37,200
Well, I... This is
a surprise to you?

1604
01:29:37,271 --> 01:29:38,533
Daphne, you're not listening.

1605
01:29:38,606 --> 01:29:41,769
Honey, oh, no, no.
I swear, of course,
I'm listening.

1606
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:45,335
Okay. Dad and Daphne.
You're driving a bus.

1607
01:29:45,413 --> 01:29:49,349
Five hundred catrillion
cazillion get on.

1608
01:29:49,417 --> 01:29:51,681
But zero...
Lionel, look.

1609
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:53,220
A blimp.
Where?

1610
01:29:53,287 --> 01:29:54,914
Right there.
I can't see it.

1611
01:29:54,989 --> 01:29:57,014
Right there. Look harder.
Where? Show me.

1612
01:29:57,091 --> 01:29:59,525
I can't see it.
Up, up. Look harder.

1613
01:30:02,764 --> 01:30:06,757
I've wanted to talk to you
for the past few days
and I haven't had the nerve.

1614
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:08,995
That I find hard to believe.

1615
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:11,699
Johnny, you have
too much pride.

1616
01:30:11,773 --> 01:30:13,263
I prefer to call it
common sense.

1617
01:30:13,341 --> 01:30:16,674
It's pride,
and it's a quality
you and I share.

1618
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:19,838
It's an admirable one,
until it becomes a wall.

1619
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:22,513
"Well, yes, I am alone,

1620
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:25,711
"but at least
I have my righteous anger
to keep me company at night."

1621
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:27,778
Come on, that's not a life,
and you know it.

1622
01:30:27,855 --> 01:30:30,346
And let's face it.
I mean, if it wasn't for me,

1623
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:33,656
obviously Milly
never would have betrayed you
in the first place.

1624
01:30:33,728 --> 01:30:35,559
So what are you doing, Johnny?
What are you doing?

1625
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:38,360
Why waste one more minute
of your life?

1626
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:41,259
And I'm right.

1627
01:30:41,335 --> 01:30:43,633
I'm so right.

1628
01:30:44,338 --> 01:30:45,805
Damn it.

1629
01:30:45,873 --> 01:30:47,568
For once, she is.

1630
01:30:50,912 --> 01:30:53,176
Jeez, you guys,
no one's listening.

1631
01:30:53,247 --> 01:30:55,909
If Milly was here,
she would get my joke.

1632
01:30:55,983 --> 01:30:59,783
You're driving a bus.
Ten people get on.
Ten people get off.

1633
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:03,187
Thirty thousand get on.
Thirty thousand get off.
A million get on...

1634
01:31:03,858 --> 01:31:05,621
See, that's the fun
of the tuna pasta toss,

1635
01:31:05,693 --> 01:31:07,854
'cause it's delicious
and it's easy,

1636
01:31:07,929 --> 01:31:09,521
because when
you're cooking for one,

1637
01:31:09,597 --> 01:31:12,191
it's really important
to look forward to
the end result. You know?

1638
01:31:12,266 --> 01:31:14,826
JOHNNY: What if you want to
make it for two?

1639
01:31:20,341 --> 01:31:25,574
It's a little bit
more complicated,
but I think it can be done.

1640
01:31:31,519 --> 01:31:33,077
I see some of you
have gone ahead

1641
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:36,487
and already
added your carrots
and your pickled relish.

1642
01:31:36,557 --> 01:31:38,616
And remember
that some people like dill.

1643
01:31:38,693 --> 01:31:42,060
Even before I met you,
I had an instinct about you.

1644
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:46,194
And once I saw
you were a woman
with profound static cling,

1645
01:31:46,267 --> 01:31:48,861
I wanted to be
that force around you.

1646
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:53,034
Personally, I love dill.
I think it's not used enough

1647
01:31:53,107 --> 01:31:55,405
and very underrated,
sort of, like, mayonnaise,

1648
01:31:55,476 --> 01:31:58,741
and I also really love
olive oil for tuna.

1649
01:31:58,813 --> 01:32:02,408
I love that
when I breathe you in,
you smell of cake batter.

1650
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:07,585
And I love that
you have this insane way

1651
01:32:07,655 --> 01:32:10,920
of talking in circles
that makes perfect sense.

1652
01:32:12,193 --> 01:32:13,251
I do?

1653
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:17,591
'Cause sometimes
I feel like
nobody understands me but...

1654
01:32:17,665 --> 01:32:18,723
Me.

1655
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:20,831
I get you.

1656
01:32:23,771 --> 01:32:28,435
That's wonderful.
But, you know,
my bladder is about to pop.

1657
01:32:28,509 --> 01:32:30,739
Can you hold it for a minute?

1658
01:32:34,782 --> 01:32:37,478
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, guys.
Where were we?

1659
01:32:38,619 --> 01:32:41,611
With the tuna pasta
and the tuna noodle doodles,

1660
01:32:41,689 --> 01:32:42,951
tuna sandwiches, tuna...

1661
01:32:43,024 --> 01:32:45,322
I love your eyes.

1662
01:32:47,094 --> 01:32:48,925
I even love

1663
01:32:51,165 --> 01:32:52,632
your mother.

get this show on the road.
MAGGIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1665
01:33:34,308 --> 01:33:36,367
Where is she?
Well, it should have started
20 minutes ago.

1666
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,503
That's not like her.
I mean, the ceremony
has to start soon.

I don't know
where she is, though.

I'm worried.
I hope she's okay.

Just call her.
All right. I'm calling.

1673
01:33:47,855 --> 01:33:49,755
It's her own wedding.

Hi, Mom. Where are you?

Honey, I just have to
talk to you a little
bit later, okay? Mil...

1679
01:34:05,172 --> 01:34:08,972
Oh, my God. I kind of think
she's having sex
with Joe right now.

01:34:09,043 --> 01:34:10,169
Great.
Awesome.

1681
01:34:10,244 --> 01:34:13,145
Would she like us to explain
that to all the guests,
or just the preacher?

1682
01:34:13,214 --> 01:34:14,704
She is a woman after
my own heart.

1683
01:34:14,782 --> 01:34:17,512
All right, Mom?
We are gonna give you
five more minutes.

1684
01:34:17,585 --> 01:34:19,109
Ten. Ten.

1685

Open up
the champagne, sweetie.
