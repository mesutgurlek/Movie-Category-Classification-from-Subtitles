Have our lookouts been
given Octavian's insignia ?

2
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:07,366
A golden eagle.
We've had it in sight since sunrise--

3
00:00:07,468 --> 00:00:09,800
By sunset we'll have
those gold feathers.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,631
Let Octavian know
we are coming !

5
00:00:14,742 --> 00:00:19,441
Let the enemy hear the voice
of Antony's legions !

00:00:44,105 --> 00:00:48,940
He's on his way.
Signal my Lord Caesar's ship.
Does it fly his insignia ?

9
00:00:49,043 --> 00:00:51,603
My orders are to be followed
exactly as issued.

10
00:00:56,917 --> 00:01:01,377
And may the gods grant that Antony
has not changed his plan of battle.

11
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:09,561
There he goes,

12
00:01:09,663 --> 00:01:13,827
as he's done a hundred times on land--
straight for the center.

13
00:01:13,934 --> 00:01:18,462
If only it were on land, and we
were there to protect his flanks.

14
00:01:18,572 --> 00:01:20,472
But we're not.

15
00:01:24,278 --> 00:01:27,145
This and all other dispositions are
to be signaled to Admiral Euphranor...

16
00:01:27,248 --> 00:01:29,307
aboard
Queen Cleopatra's barge.

17
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:31,317
Euphranor ! But surely
he's in command of--

18
00:01:31,419 --> 00:01:35,719
In command of moving toy ships
on a painted ocean...

19
00:01:35,823 --> 00:01:39,884
so that Egypt's queen can more
clearly follow her war upon water...

20
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:43,361
to which she has committed
Marc Antony and 20,000 Romans.

21
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:56,068
Just as he said he would.

22
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:59,977
Lord Antony and his escorts have moved
out by themselves after Octavian.

23
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:02,982
- He's already broken
through their center.
- They let him through.

24
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:05,109
The Roman line
will close behind him.

25
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,119
Not if we engage and hold them,
as Antony said.

26
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:12,181
They won't engage. Agrippa will
pull them back and back, behind Antony,

27
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:14,193
as Antony
chases Octavian.

28
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,630
What reports
do you have ?

29
00:02:18,732 --> 00:02:22,634
Lord Antony is already through the
center of the Roman line, Your Majesty.

30
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:30,241
He is now deep within the Roman fleet,
in pursuit of Octavian.

31
00:02:41,822 --> 00:02:43,722
Faster ! Faster !

32
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:59,130
They've increased their own speed,
my lord. We're too heavy to catch them.

33
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,765
Then we'll slow them down.

34
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:05,039
Start the ballistas.
Javelin throwers.

35
00:03:05,146 --> 00:03:07,944
Aim high.
Overshoot rather than under.

36
00:03:12,553 --> 00:03:14,680
Ballistas. Javelins.

37
00:03:19,593 --> 00:03:21,493
Ballistas !

38
00:03:32,072 --> 00:03:37,135
Octavian's ships are so much faster
than our Egyptian tubs.

39
00:03:37,244 --> 00:03:40,213
Why doesn't Agrippa keep him away
from Antony's ballistas ?

40
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:56,696
[ Ramos ]

My lord !
My lord !

44
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:35,392
A direct hit on the enemy.
One bank of oars has been destroyed.

45
00:04:38,973 --> 00:04:41,874
He's coming around
broadside.

46
00:04:41,976 --> 00:04:44,410
We've got him.
Collision course.

47
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:47,776
We'll ram him,
board and destroy him.

48
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:44,636
Octavian !

49
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:50,940
O<i>c</i>tavian! No<i>w</i> is
your time to be a Caesar.

50
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:20,467
- Where is he hiding ?
- My Lord Octavian is not on board.

51
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:26,645
And now we close the trap.

52
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:30,205
Now we hit my Lord Antony
with everything we have.

53
00:06:52,506 --> 00:06:56,237
No word of Lord Antony ?
By now he must have Octavian.

54
00:06:56,343 --> 00:06:58,243
You, yourself, said
he rammed Octavian's ship.

55
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:02,247
It may be Lord Antony rammed a ship
flying Octavian's insignia, huh ?

56
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:05,682
But if it is Octavian's ship--
If Octavian is on board--

57
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:08,311
And if Lord Antony
fiinds and kills Octavian,

58
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:10,720
he is still surrounded
by half the Roman fleet.

59
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:13,384
- Then send him help.
- I've none to send.

60

They're pulling
our ships apart now.

61
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,225
They've got Antony alone
and cut off,

62
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:26,432
closing in on him like a pack of dogs
on a wounded bear.

63
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:50,814
- Lord Antony's ship ?
- Gone.

64
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:55,862
- And Octavian's ship ?
- Burning, helpless.

65
00:09:04,838 --> 00:09:07,602
Would you say, Admiral,

66
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,973
that Lord Antony is dead ?

that he no longer has a quarrel
with Cleopatra of Egypt.

Then let him take his armies
out of here and go home.

He has charged me to say that the choice
of war or peace now rests with Egypt.

And that for himself,
he desires only pea<i>c</i>e.

And what are his terms for
this unconditional peace ?

135
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,806
A small token.
A demonstration.

The, uh,
head of Marc Antony ?

Take this to him
as my answer.

Egyptian generosity.

142
00:20:24,117 --> 00:20:27,917
Octavian may have two heads
for the price of one.

143
00:20:28,021 --> 00:20:31,855
Either two... or none.

144

a part of your being drunk.

Your time would be better spent, it
seems to me, negotiating with Octavian.

00:22:05,485 --> 00:22:07,385
Dying the second time
is painless, they say,

157
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:09,512
and possibly
a great advantage to you,

158
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:12,318
the basis, perhaps,
of a great new alliance with Rome.

159
00:22:12,425 --> 00:22:16,725
- I do not want a great
new alliance with Rome.
- Then what do you want ?

160
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:21,028
I have come for Marc Antony.

161
00:22:21,134 --> 00:22:24,069
What is left of his army,
Rufiio, my son and I,

162
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:27,469
all of Egypt
are waiting for him.

163
00:22:27,573 --> 00:22:30,269
There is little time.

164
00:22:30,376 --> 00:22:33,243
Marc Antony ?

165
00:22:33,346 --> 00:22:38,340
There is no one here
by that name... alive.

166
00:22:57,603 --> 00:22:59,537
Time for <i>w</i>hat ?

167
00:23:01,007 --> 00:23:03,805
For Marc Antony
to appear in shiny armor,

168
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,037
swords flashing
in both hands ?

169
00:23:06,145 --> 00:23:08,306
Pfft, Agrippa.
Pfft, Octavian.

170
00:23:08,414 --> 00:23:12,714
Stand back ! Rejoice !
Marc Antony will save the day !

171
00:23:19,425 --> 00:23:21,518
Antony, you say ?

172
00:23:21,627 --> 00:23:26,360
He died at Actium,
running away.

173
00:23:26,466 --> 00:23:30,334
He tried to run on the water,
the story goes, but you were
not there to hold his hand.

174
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:40,969
Rufiio, my legions,
waiting.

175
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,980
For what ?

176
00:23:43,082 --> 00:23:46,984
To ask of me what they carry
in their eyes, in their hearts,
in their sleep at night...

177
00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:48,986
as I have in mine.

178
00:23:49,088 --> 00:23:51,852
Why are you not dead ?

179
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,858
Why do you live ?
How can you live ?

180
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,191
Why do you not lie
in the deepest hole of the sea,

181
00:23:57,296 --> 00:24:01,130
bloodless and bloated and
at peace with honorable death ?

182
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:13,803
You... begged forgiveness
from me for running away.

183
00:24:13,913 --> 00:24:17,781
You wept and gave your reason. A mother
to her child, a queen to her country.

184
00:24:17,884 --> 00:24:20,910
Where and how can I weep
and beg ? From whom ?

185
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,512
The thousands and thousands
who can no longer hear me ?

186
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,728
Shall I give my reason ?

187
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:32,730
Shall I say simply...
I loved ?

188
00:24:34,634 --> 00:24:39,230
When <i>I</i> sa<i>w</i> you go, <i>I</i> sa<i>w</i>
nothing-- felt, heard, thought
nothing ex<i>c</i>ept your going.

189
00:24:39,338 --> 00:24:42,171
Not the dying and dead,
not Rome, not Egypt,

190
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:45,369
not victory or defeat, honor or
disgrace, friend, enemy, future or past,

191
00:24:45,478 --> 00:24:48,606
only that my love was going
and that I must be with her.

192
00:24:48,714 --> 00:24:51,239
That my love,
my master called.

193
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,545
And <i>I</i> follo<i>w</i>ed.

194
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:56,281
And that only then,

195
00:24:56,389 --> 00:24:59,324
I looked back...

196
00:24:59,425 --> 00:25:01,325
and I saw.

197
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:15,473
How right you were.

198
00:25:15,575 --> 00:25:21,377
'' Have as your master
anyone, anything...

199
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:23,506
but never love.''

200
00:25:23,616 --> 00:25:26,847
How wrong--

201
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:30,116
How wrong I was.

202
00:25:30,223 --> 00:25:34,023
Antony, the love
you followed is here.

203
00:25:34,126 --> 00:25:37,357
To be had
upon payment of an empire.

204
00:25:37,463 --> 00:25:40,125
Without you, Antony,

205
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:42,861
this is not a world
I want to live in,

206
00:25:42,969 --> 00:25:46,837
mu<i>c</i>h less <i>c</i>on<i>q</i>uer.

207
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:50,136
Because for me...

208
00:25:50,243 --> 00:25:53,474
there would be
no love anywhere.

209
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:59,039
Do you want me to die
with you ? I will.

210
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,182
Or do you <i>w</i>ant me
to live <i>w</i>ith you ?

211
00:26:05,424 --> 00:26:07,324
Whatever you choose.

212
00:26:21,474 --> 00:26:25,706
Are we too late, do you think,
if we choose to live ?

213
00:26:25,811 --> 00:26:28,439
Better too late...

214
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:30,778
than never.

215
00:27:29,976 --> 00:27:33,275
[ Apollodorus ] <i>M</i>y lady, there is
disturbing ne<i>w</i>s from the <i>c</i>ity.

216
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:37,679
The people are frightened. Some are
beginning to leave their homes.

217
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:41,651
During the night, hundreds of notices
were secretly posted everywhere.

218
00:27:41,754 --> 00:27:44,552
They were found this morning
stuck up in the marketplace,

219
00:27:44,657 --> 00:27:47,820
even painted on the walls of temples
and other holy places.

220
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:53,229
Signed by Octavian Caius
Julius Caesar Augustus,

221
00:27:53,332 --> 00:27:57,428
promising the Egyptian people
peace if they surrender to him...

222
00:27:57,536 --> 00:27:59,436
and destruction
if they do not.

223
00:27:59,538 --> 00:28:01,938
I've had all
of the notices removed...

224
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:05,169
and I've ordered the death penalty for
anyone who spreads the false rumors...

225
00:28:05,277 --> 00:28:07,677
that Lord Antony's men
might desert him.

226
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:12,683
And what penalty if the rumors
might come true ?

227
00:28:14,286 --> 00:28:16,186
How do you know ?

228
00:28:16,288 --> 00:28:18,381
I know the Romans.

229
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:21,858
There is only one commander
they will never desert.

230
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:24,486
His name... is Victory.

231
00:28:24,597 --> 00:28:28,727
But yet,just now, you let
Lord Antony go as if--

232
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:37,875
If you could have seen him,
how proud he was,

233
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:39,877
unafraid,

234
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,142
as he used to be.

235
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,150
All of my attendants--

236
00:28:46,252 --> 00:28:48,914
Have they been given their freedom ?
Have they gone ?

237
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:52,081
Yes. They wanted
once more to tidy up.

238
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:55,126
Octavian can do
his own housecleaning.

239
00:28:55,227 --> 00:28:59,288
The captain of the guards
and three of his best men
are to report to me at once,

240
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:01,423
disguised as merchants.

241
00:29:01,534 --> 00:29:05,595
They are to escort
Caesarion out of Egypt,

242
00:29:05,705 --> 00:29:08,333
for the time being.

243
00:29:08,441 --> 00:29:12,537
And you ?
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

244
00:29:12,645 --> 00:29:15,978
There are two of Euphranor's ships,
very fast, in the East Harbor.

245
00:29:16,082 --> 00:29:19,916
And would you roll me
on board in a carpet ?

246
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:21,919
No.

247
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:26,583
There are no more Caesars to go to,
at least not for me.

248
00:29:26,692 --> 00:29:31,220
- Then it is still your intention to--
- To remain in Alexandria.

249
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:35,391
In the last possible place
anyone would look.

250
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:39,597
Literally,
the last possible place.

251
00:29:39,705 --> 00:29:44,938
- Your Majesty, I have never
questioned your decisions.
- This is not the time to begin.

252
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:49,708
- Let me stay with you.
- Charmian and Eiras will look after me.

253
00:29:49,815 --> 00:29:51,715
If Lord Antony should--

254
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:57,016
When Lord Antony returns,

255
00:29:57,123 --> 00:30:00,286
you will be here to tell him
where to fiind me...

256
00:30:00,392 --> 00:30:03,020
<i>w</i>aiting for him.

257
00:30:03,129 --> 00:30:07,691
Together, we will then do...
what he thinks best.

258
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,700
Is that clear ?

259
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:16,641
- Yes, my lady.
- Was there anything more ?

260
00:30:18,477 --> 00:30:20,377
I have always
loved you.

261
00:30:21,981 --> 00:30:24,074
And I have always known.

262
00:30:36,695 --> 00:30:39,061
Rome has never known
such an army.

263
00:30:39,165 --> 00:30:41,599
We should be taking on
the combined powers of Asia.

264
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,965
It seems almost a waste
of time to slaughter what's
left of Antony's army...

265
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,595
- and what's left of Antony.
- There will be no slaughter.

266
00:30:47,706 --> 00:30:50,174
I doubt there will
be even bloodshed.

267
00:30:50,276 --> 00:30:55,043
Has a battle ever been won without
a blow being struck ? I wonder.

268
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:58,480
At any rate, let me
make it clear once more.

269
00:30:58,584 --> 00:31:02,384
I want Antony alive,
and I want her alive.

270
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:05,184
She must be taken alive.

271
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:13,926
Queen Cleopatra's second procession
into Rome will surpass her fiirst.

272
00:31:26,478 --> 00:31:30,005
The ring
your father gave you,

273
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:34,347
it is yours now...
to keep.

274
00:31:34,453 --> 00:31:38,822
Wear it with pride
and with honor.

275
00:31:38,924 --> 00:31:42,883
I'm afraid.
I know I shouldn't be.

276
00:31:42,995 --> 00:31:45,327
Who told you that ?

277
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:50,528
All kings and
especially queens are afraid.

278
00:31:50,636 --> 00:31:53,764
They just manage
not to show it,

279
00:31:53,873 --> 00:31:56,865
something ordinary people
cannot do.

280
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,732
Hail... Antony !

281
00:33:20,926 --> 00:33:24,362
- How near is Octavian ?
- Very near. Over that low ridge.

282
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:28,058
As it grows darker, the glow from
his campfiires will light up the sky.

283
00:33:33,572 --> 00:33:36,939
Our troops must fiind it
attractive to watch.

284
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:39,442
Inviting, even.

285
00:33:39,545 --> 00:33:42,742
Antony's legions warm themselves
at their own fiires.

286
00:33:42,848 --> 00:33:47,717
Yes. I could feel
the warmth as I rode by.

287
00:33:49,555 --> 00:33:51,489
- How many legions has he ?
- Twenty.

288
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:54,525
- And we ?
- Two. The 1 2th and one made up from--

289
00:33:54,626 --> 00:33:57,254
Made up from what was left
of the others.

290
00:33:57,363 --> 00:34:02,198
As I remember it, Caesar
held Alexandria with two.

291
00:34:05,637 --> 00:34:07,832
How are they deployed ?
Rufiio.

292
00:34:11,477 --> 00:34:16,244
Cavalry to the left, cavalry
to the right, infantry to the center.

293
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:21,308
Three elephants deployed
to stamp out a fly.

294
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,753
My lords Octavian and Agrippa have
all the strategic brilliance...

295
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:28,418
of two vestal virgins.

296
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:29,962
We <i>c</i>an dra<i>w</i> ba<i>c</i>k here to softer ground,
too soft for <i>c</i>avalry,

297
00:34:29,962 --> 00:34:31,293
We <i>c</i>an dra<i>w</i> ba<i>c</i>k here to softer ground,
too soft for <i>c</i>avalry,

298
00:34:31,397 --> 00:34:33,297
and make our stand
against their infantry.

299
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:37,859
Stand ? And let them stamp on us ?
No. Let the elephants stand.

300
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:41,133
We flies will bite
and buzz and tickle.

301
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,731
At the <i>fiir</i>st light
of day...

302
00:34:43,842 --> 00:34:47,403
while Octavian's glow
still lights up the sky,

303
00:34:47,513 --> 00:34:49,413
we will attack.

304
00:34:52,618 --> 00:34:55,678
By sunset both our loyal legions
will have grown larger...

305
00:34:55,788 --> 00:34:57,983
and even more loyal,
I promise you.

306
00:35:00,025 --> 00:35:01,925
Good night.

307
00:35:10,936 --> 00:35:13,905
Rufiio,
tell the guards, please,

308
00:35:14,006 --> 00:35:17,703
- I am to be awakened just before dawn.
- Of course.

309

And, Rufiio,

00:35:19,812 --> 00:35:25,546
if, for whatever reason, the guards
should forget or misjudge the time,

00:35:25,651 --> 00:35:27,710
will you, yourself,
wake me ?

312
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,618
The guards will wake you.

313
00:35:32,491 --> 00:35:35,517
- But if they don't ?
- Then I will. Never fear.

314
00:35:35,627 --> 00:35:37,959
I never fear.

00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:45,669
Not anymore.

Why don't you fiight ?

Is there no one who would grant Antony
an honorable way to die ?

Before me,

this was carried by another Roman
killed by Rome.

Where is she ?

Where is she ?

possible place anyone would look.

Once more, it seems,

341

- Help me to die, Apollodorus !
- I want to ! But I can't.

350

Else how could I have missed what
I must have aimed for all my life ?

Will you fiinish me now ?

Where is my sword ?
I beg you to fiinish me.

357
00:46:03,254 --> 00:46:05,916
I lied to you.
I let you think the queen is dead.

But she's alive in her tomb,
waiting for you.

Perhaps, my lady, if we were
to bind his wounds tightly--

364
00:47:24,235 --> 00:47:28,695
It would only give him pain.

They will always meet.

Be lonely for me.

But not for very long,
I promise.

I would die...

I expected too much
of me in death,

prove death...

388

- Lord Antony is dead.

how one says it ?

''Antony is living.

Shake with terror when
such words pass your lips,

for fear they be untrue and
Antony cut out your tongue for the lie.

- Look at me !

to see my dead body
dragged through the Forum ?

would you permit
my son to rule Egypt ?

And his sons ?
And theirs ?

- When will you require me to go ?
- As soon as possible.

like to rest. If you will leave me now.

to sustain me on my way.

00:56:37,621 --> 00:56:40,988
- Some fruit perhaps ?
- Bring it to me.

00:56:48,632 --> 00:56:51,260
You then, Eiras.

476
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:56,671
You have never been without us.
You cannot leave us behind.

477
00:56:58,275 --> 00:57:00,539
Perhaps...

478
00:57:00,644 --> 00:57:04,011
there may be enough
for us all.

479
00:57:04,115 --> 00:57:06,413
Bring me a tablet
to write on.

480
00:57:06,517 --> 00:57:08,644
I shall want a message
brought to Octavian.

481
00:57:08,753 --> 00:57:11,586
Words are wasted
on such a man.

482
00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:15,455
I've wasted so many
on so many men.

483
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:18,722
A few more,
one last request.

484
00:57:18,829 --> 00:57:21,354
Will he grant it,
do you think ?

485
00:57:21,465 --> 00:57:23,365
I may never know.

486
00:57:26,404 --> 00:57:29,339
But in this case,

487
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,340
I think I shall.

488
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:42,685
I will serve Her Majesty
as always.

489
00:57:42,787 --> 00:57:44,687
It is I who have
always served her.

490
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:47,087
You will both wait...

491
00:57:47,191 --> 00:57:50,627
to dress me
for my travels.

492
00:57:50,728 --> 00:57:53,856
I will wear--

I want to be
as Antony fiirst saw me.

00:57:57,001 --> 00:58:01,438
- The dress of gold.
- He must know at once,

495
00:58:01,539 --> 00:58:04,997
even from a great distance,

496
00:58:05,109 --> 00:58:07,407
that it is I.

497
00:58:07,511 --> 00:58:10,480
This will be
the last thing you do.

498
00:58:10,581 --> 00:58:14,039
Drop this to one
of the guards outside for Octavian.

499
00:58:15,619 --> 00:58:17,519
But be sure to wait.

500
00:58:37,408 --> 00:58:41,310
Now let me see if the fiigs
are as they should be.

How strangely awake I feel,

as if living had been
just a long dream.

Someone else's dream,

now fiinished at last.

But now...

00:59:42,673 --> 00:59:45,574
will begin...

510
00:59:45,676 --> 00:59:48,270
a dream of my own...

511
00:59:50,014 --> 00:59:52,278
which will never end.

512
00:59:55,619 --> 00:59:57,519

From the Egyptian queen, my lord.
A message for Caesar.

517
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:23,679
Read it, Agrippa.
Whatever she wants will be granted
upon her arrival in Rome.

518
01:00:23,781 --> 01:00:27,911
We will discuss it
as she walks beside my chariot.
