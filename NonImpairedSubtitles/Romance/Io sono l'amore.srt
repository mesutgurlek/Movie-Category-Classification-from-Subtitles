1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,465
I AM LOVE

2
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:59,148
Madam, your son told me
he is bringing a guest.

3
00:03:00,153 --> 00:03:02,644
- A guest?
- Yes. A girl...

4
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,500
So, we have Gratieni
and his wife here,

5
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:22,768
Betta and Gregorio...

6
00:03:26,012 --> 00:03:27,707
probably... here.

7
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:32,340
- Between Edo and Delfina.
- Yes.

8
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:35,650
She should sit next to Edoardo.

9
00:03:35,688 --> 00:03:37,781
She doesn't know anyone.

10
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:46,025
- Is Edo back?
- Not yet.

11
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:51,637
- Any news on the race?
- He came in second.

12
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:53,298
Second?

13
00:03:53,339 --> 00:03:56,797
The snow, Grandpa's birthday,
Edo losing a race...

14
00:03:58,144 --> 00:04:00,339
Three events in just one day!

15
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:09,654
Maybe this year we'll be spared
Edo's dish.

16
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:11,850
What do you say, Betta?

17
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:14,382
Your sister's in a bad mood today.

18
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:19,023
- What's for breakfast?
- Thanks, Ida.

19
00:04:31,544 --> 00:04:36,004
He's never this late.
He must really like this girl!

20
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:38,142
Hi, Anita.

21
00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:41,517
- Good morning, Ida.
- Good morning, Edoardo.

22
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:44,352
- Good morning, Liliana.
- Good morning, Mr. Edoardo.

23
00:04:55,902 --> 00:04:59,269
Here you are, my love.

24
00:04:59,305 --> 00:05:03,742
- Thanks for the soup, Mamma.
- I have to add some saffron.

25
00:05:03,776 --> 00:05:06,244
- Who is she?
- Be nice to her, she's really shy.

26
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,407
Her name is Eva.

27
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:11,610
Ida is a little jealous.

28
00:05:39,178 --> 00:05:41,874
Edo lost the race today.

29
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:44,884
He'll have more time
to concentrate on work.

30
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:47,443
Good morning, Madam.
Good morning, Sir.

31
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:51,150
- How are you, Ida?
- Very well, thank you. And you?

32
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,852
- You look well.
- Thank you.

33
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,922
Happy birthday.

34
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:03,835
- Good morning.
- How are you?

35
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,839
Very well, Madam.
And you?

36
00:06:06,873 --> 00:06:09,307
We've been through happier times.

37
00:06:17,317 --> 00:06:19,547
Look how they've grown.

38
00:06:23,022 --> 00:06:24,990
Grandpa!

39
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:28,118
Elisabetta, how are you?

40
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:29,458
Fine.

41
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:31,986
- Nothing for me?
- Happy birthday, Grandpa.

42
00:06:38,638 --> 00:06:40,629
They are here.

43
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:04,626
When did you get back?

44
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:06,393
I was a little late.

45
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:08,491
Who did you lose to today?
Gregorio?

46
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:12,493
No, to a guy I don't know.
I didn't lose, we tied.

47
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:16,838
Why didn't you challenge
the judge's ruling?

48
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:19,174
He deserved the victory.

49
00:07:21,547 --> 00:07:25,415
I spoke to your brother this morning.
It's a pity you weren't there.

50
00:07:30,456 --> 00:07:33,357
Your grandfather's
in an excellent mood today.

51
00:07:33,393 --> 00:07:36,829
- Is this Eva from the Ugolini family?
- Yes, the poor side.

52
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:41,266
Gianluca, you're even more of a snob
than your father.

53
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,427
More than your grandmother!

54
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,037
Hello, Grandpa. Happy birthday.

55
00:07:49,742 --> 00:07:51,903
It surprises me

56
00:07:51,944 --> 00:07:56,779
that Tancredi gave it to Emma
as a wedding gift.

57
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:03,512
Tell me, how did you manage
to lose today's race?

58
00:08:03,556 --> 00:08:08,357
It was fixed.
They wanted him out of the running.

59
00:08:08,394 --> 00:08:10,885
I don't think so...

60
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,194
- I was up against someone stronger.
- Impossible!

61
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:15,325
- The Recchis are unbeatable.
- That's right.

62
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:25,536
The doctor said we shouldn't worry.

63
00:08:25,578 --> 00:08:28,308
He is fighting with all his strength

64
00:08:28,347 --> 00:08:31,145
and his heart is responding well.

65
00:08:36,522 --> 00:08:38,581
He has decided.

66
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:45,457
I'm glad you lost the race.

67
00:08:46,966 --> 00:08:51,096
From now on you won't have
any further distractions.

68
00:08:51,137 --> 00:08:53,901
I want to go to London
to see Herzog and De Meuron.

69
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,841
- Who?
- They designed the new Tate Gallery.

70
00:08:56,876 --> 00:08:58,844
The Tate Gallery?

71
00:08:58,878 --> 00:09:01,506
I want to give them the scaffolding
covers for the next project.

72
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:05,608
- It'd guarantee years of work.
- Are you sure?

73
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,981
- Madam, you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

74
00:10:40,146 --> 00:10:42,376
- How are we doing here?
- Well.

75
00:10:55,595 --> 00:10:58,063
Is everything all right?

76
00:11:02,468 --> 00:11:07,405
Betta, Eva works in Atellani's,
the bookshop on Corso Magenta.

77
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,773
The one below Grandpa's house?
I've never seen you there.

78
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,610
I've not been there long.
I'm in the art department.

79
00:11:24,357 --> 00:11:26,325
- Where is Pierluigi?
- He's coming.

80
00:11:30,863 --> 00:11:32,296
Thank you.

81
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,306
Not Edo's <i>ukha</i> dish again!
Enough!

82
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:51,841
No, it's fabulous!
"Ton sur ton".

83
00:11:51,884 --> 00:11:53,647
You're right, Andrea.

84
00:11:53,686 --> 00:11:57,520
"Ton sur ton"
is better than "con sur con"!

85
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:04,823
Eva, how did the race go?
You were there, right?

86
00:12:04,864 --> 00:12:07,594
The guy who beat Edo is a chef.

87
00:12:07,633 --> 00:12:09,828
- Do you know him?
- No.

88
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:12,360
But his restaurant is in a building
owned by my family.

89
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:17,169
- Beaten by a chef?
- It wasn't fair.

90
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:20,178
- Edo won.
- If you say so...

91
00:14:16,128 --> 00:14:17,527
Shall we go?

92
00:14:19,432 --> 00:14:22,595
- Can I see it?
- Together with the others.

93
00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:23,966
Thanks.

94
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:28,103
Let's go.

95
00:14:44,523 --> 00:14:48,084
May I have your attention?

96
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:52,757
I have all of my granddaughter's
drawings on a wall.

97
00:14:52,798 --> 00:14:57,531
When she becomes a famous painter,
I'll have people pay to see them.

98
00:15:11,016 --> 00:15:12,711
What is this?

99
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:18,312
I took it at the Hanbury Gardens.
You took me there.

100
00:15:19,592 --> 00:15:21,924
I want to move into photography now.

101
00:15:24,663 --> 00:15:26,528
I like it. It's beautiful.

102
00:15:28,534 --> 00:15:32,493
Yes, I like it too.

103
00:15:34,206 --> 00:15:37,004
I'm just thrown by novelties.

104
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:39,704
I don't think he likes it.

105
00:15:41,213 --> 00:15:44,979
You still owe me a drawing.

106
00:15:45,017 --> 00:15:46,746
Come here.

107
00:15:52,391 --> 00:15:54,382
I like it. It's wonderful.

108
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:57,224
Really.

109
00:16:24,056 --> 00:16:25,148
Thank you.

110
00:16:27,726 --> 00:16:29,216
For you.

111
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,322
Thank you.

112
00:16:46,111 --> 00:16:48,102
My dear friends,

113
00:16:49,148 --> 00:16:50,945
I don't want to die

114
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,011
and I won't

115
00:16:56,288 --> 00:16:59,257
as long as the business
carries on

116
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,782
in the same spirit

117
00:17:01,827 --> 00:17:05,661
in which I created it.

118
00:17:09,535 --> 00:17:13,995
Our family's fortune
is built on the factory.

119
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:17,475
Every brick, every man,

120
00:17:17,509 --> 00:17:19,807
every piece of material

121
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:22,973
is living proof

122
00:17:23,015 --> 00:17:27,008
of what we have been.

123
00:17:27,052 --> 00:17:31,989
We engraved our name
in our country's history

124
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:35,255
when, both during the war
and after,

125
00:17:35,294 --> 00:17:38,286
we were able to tend to its needs

126
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,323
with our factory's constant,
busy activity.

127
00:17:43,335 --> 00:17:47,863
The company was born Recchi,
and Recchi it must remain forever.

128
00:17:52,311 --> 00:17:55,109
The time has come

129
00:17:55,147 --> 00:17:58,981
for me to retire

130
00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:02,510
and name my successor.

131
00:18:07,893 --> 00:18:11,021
My son has always lived up

132
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:13,531
to my expectations.

133
00:18:13,565 --> 00:18:17,057
I knew he would from the moment
I first held him in my arms.

134
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:20,864
Thank you, Tancredi,

135
00:18:20,906 --> 00:18:23,898
for having been
the son I always wanted

136
00:18:23,942 --> 00:18:28,436
and for having created
such a marvelous family.

137
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:33,746
I see qualities in your children...

138
00:18:33,786 --> 00:18:37,813
that will lead them
to live intense

139
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:41,451
and fruitful lives, as I have.

140
00:18:43,262 --> 00:18:46,595
Of course, my grandson
had to choose this day

141
00:18:46,632 --> 00:18:51,035
of all days to interrupt
our family's athletic tradition!

142
00:19:01,313 --> 00:19:03,543
Therefore...

143
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:09,479
I have decided to leave

144
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:14,924
everything in your hands, Tancredi.

145
00:19:24,603 --> 00:19:27,766
And in your son Edoardo's.

146
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:40,445
It will take two men
to replace me!

147
00:19:43,355 --> 00:19:47,951
Here's to Tancredi and Edoardo!

148
00:19:47,993 --> 00:19:49,858
To the Recchis!

149
00:19:56,135 --> 00:19:57,830
Come here, you winner!

150
00:20:03,976 --> 00:20:05,910
Go to the cellar.

151
00:20:05,944 --> 00:20:08,435
Bring two bottles of '49.

152
00:20:26,498 --> 00:20:28,830
Yes?

153
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:31,802
It's for Edoardo Recchi.

154
00:20:31,837 --> 00:20:34,670
- Can I take it?
- I'd prefer to deliver it myself.

155
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:37,038
- Who are you?
- Antonio Biscaglia.

156
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:38,906
One moment.

157
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:45,016
This way.

158
00:20:46,318 --> 00:20:49,719
Follow the path. It'll take you
to the entrance of the villa.

159
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,343
Ida, leave it.

160
00:21:27,025 --> 00:21:28,754
What are you doing here?

161
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:33,858
That's the chef...
the one who beat Edo.

162
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:35,526
Come in!

163
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,339
I wanted to bring you a gift.

164
00:21:41,373 --> 00:21:44,001
A gift?

165
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:47,534
For me? I get it. You're no longer
certain of your victory today.

166
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:51,276
- You put up a good fight.
- Come in.

167
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:52,943
It's a special night for my family.

168
00:21:52,985 --> 00:21:57,217
I'd rather not, thanks.

169
00:21:57,256 --> 00:21:58,416
As you wish.

170
00:21:58,457 --> 00:22:02,985
I made you a cake.
I'm a chef.

171
00:22:05,264 --> 00:22:07,255
Mamma!

172
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:09,995
I want to show you something.

173
00:22:13,906 --> 00:22:17,603
- This is Antonio.
- Good evening.

174
00:22:17,643 --> 00:22:19,508
Look what he made for me.

175
00:22:20,512 --> 00:22:22,912
Isn't it a work of art? He made it.

176
00:22:22,948 --> 00:22:26,406
He's the guy that beat me today.
That's why he doesn't want to stay.

177
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:29,910
- Please stay.
- It doesn't matter, thanks.

178
00:22:30,923 --> 00:22:33,483
- Are you going to bed, Mamma?
- Yes, my love.

179
00:22:42,134 --> 00:22:43,624
Ida!

180
00:22:46,772 --> 00:22:50,003
I have to take this bottle
to Grandpa - don't let him leave!

181
00:22:52,177 --> 00:22:54,805
- Should the cake go in the fridge?
- No.

182
00:22:54,846 --> 00:22:56,609
Please, come in.

183
00:23:39,324 --> 00:23:42,885
SOME MONTHS LATER

184
00:24:15,127 --> 00:24:17,186
Good morning, Madam.

185
00:24:17,229 --> 00:24:20,323
- How is your son, Edo?
- Fine, thank you.

186
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:23,232
- Just the blazer?
- Yes, only the blazer.

187
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:34,945
I've managed to get rid
of those nasty stains.

188
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,641
- It's fine.
- Yes.

189
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,190
This is for you.

190
00:24:47,225 --> 00:24:51,286
Wait, Mrs. Recchi, I found this.

191
00:24:52,831 --> 00:24:57,359
I saved it from the washing machine.
I made it just in time.

192
00:24:57,402 --> 00:25:00,098
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

193
00:25:20,826 --> 00:25:24,489
<i>Being part of a couple is as nice</i>
<i>as being alone.</i>

194
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:26,690
<i>We need to be brave.</i>

195
00:25:27,766 --> 00:25:31,133
They are the words of a song
that a friend made me listen to.

196
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:34,366
She's the one in the photo.
Her name is Angaharad.

197
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:41,676
<i>Edo, you're the only one</i>
<i>who loves me how I am.</i>

198
00:25:43,882 --> 00:25:46,146
<i>I have been with a girl.</i>

199
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:56,522
<i>Gregorio keeps on phoning.</i>
<i>He pretends not to understand.</i>

200
00:25:56,561 --> 00:25:58,290
<i>Maybe he doesn't understand.</i>

201
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,794
<i>I don't know if I'll see her again,</i>
<i>it was very beautiful.</i>

202
00:26:08,173 --> 00:26:11,506
<i>But I'm in love with another girl.</i>
<i>I love Angaharad.</i>

203
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,941
<i>I don't know what she thinks of me,</i>
<i>or if she likes girls.</i>

204
00:26:18,984 --> 00:26:22,579
<i>Does it matter?</i>
<i>Today I managed to make her laugh.</i>

205
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:02,726
Antonio!

206
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:07,355
Antonio?

207
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:10,926
- Hi, Tom!
- You finally made it!

208
00:27:19,044 --> 00:27:21,569
You told me
there were spectacular views,

209
00:27:23,248 --> 00:27:25,239
but I can't see anything!

210
00:27:49,307 --> 00:27:53,300
You're right, it's lovely here.

211
00:27:54,446 --> 00:27:57,472
- Isn't it a bit too remote?
- Two hours by car.

212
00:27:58,516 --> 00:28:00,108
You're right.

213
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,388
I'm having a party at my house,

214
00:28:07,425 --> 00:28:09,416
for Eva's birthday.

215
00:28:09,461 --> 00:28:11,691
I want to ask her to marry me.

216
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:18,561
Don't you have anything to say?

217
00:28:18,603 --> 00:28:22,164
- Congratulations.
- A little enthusiasm would be good!

218
00:28:22,207 --> 00:28:24,937
Honestly, I'm happy.
Let's drink to it.

219
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:28,442
Best wishes!

220
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,584
Try this.

221
00:28:37,622 --> 00:28:40,352
It's eggplant and elderflower,

222
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:43,088
I extracted the essence from here.

223
00:28:43,128 --> 00:28:46,188
If I did this at the restaurant,
my father'd be mad.

224
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:48,756
He doesn't understand what I do.

225
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,701
He just thinks of the money.

226
00:28:55,073 --> 00:28:57,701
Imagine a restaurant here.

227
00:28:57,742 --> 00:29:00,472
People would have to climb up
to try my dishes.

228
00:29:00,512 --> 00:29:03,447
The essence of flavors.
As simple as this place.

229
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:04,709
Do it.

230
00:29:04,749 --> 00:29:08,310
- This is all his, he'd never let me.
- Have you asked him?

231
00:29:09,421 --> 00:29:12,982
He thinks it's madness,
biting off more than I can chew.

232
00:29:13,024 --> 00:29:15,049
He says nobody would come.

233
00:29:15,093 --> 00:29:19,086
- I'll convince him.
- It's not that easy.

234
00:29:20,699 --> 00:29:24,829
Come on, give me a hand.
You've become a real wimp.

235
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:27,429
Did you invite me here to work?

236
00:29:41,953 --> 00:29:45,184
- Oh, how are you today?
- Doing well, thank you!

237
00:29:58,903 --> 00:30:01,428
- Good morning! How are you?
- Fine, Rachele.

238
00:30:01,473 --> 00:30:06,342
- I'm so glad you've stayed with us.
- Me too, Madam.

239
00:30:06,378 --> 00:30:09,939
She is in a terrible mood,
despite having won the lottery.

240
00:30:09,981 --> 00:30:13,007
Four straight numbers...
I should've listened to her!

241
00:30:13,051 --> 00:30:15,611
- You too?
- I keep her company.

242
00:30:17,255 --> 00:30:20,747
As if coming to my husband's funeral
wasn't enough for her.

243
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:24,387
She wrote that she shares my sorrow
over Edoardo's death.

244
00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:28,388
Shares what?
My husband was mine alone,

245
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:31,561
and anything that happened
without me is of no importance!

246
00:30:31,603 --> 00:30:34,333
- Emma!
- Andrea!

247
00:30:36,574 --> 00:30:39,270
She's in a terrible rage!
I have to go.

248
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:42,438
- Conference call with your husband.
- Goodbye.

249
00:30:45,116 --> 00:30:47,311
Thanks, Emma.

250
00:30:47,352 --> 00:30:50,549
Tancredi called me
from London yesterday.

251
00:30:50,588 --> 00:30:53,250
He is making important decisions.

252
00:30:54,325 --> 00:30:57,294
It was like listening to his father.

253
00:30:57,328 --> 00:30:59,762
He gets more like him every day.

254
00:31:01,699 --> 00:31:03,792
Elisabetta?

255
00:31:03,835 --> 00:31:08,499
She never calls. What is she up to?

256
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,509
She likes the school she has chosen.

257
00:31:12,844 --> 00:31:15,176
She's very busy studying.

258
00:31:15,213 --> 00:31:19,809
- She wanted to come back today...
- Do you like her?

259
00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:21,182
Sorry?

260
00:31:21,219 --> 00:31:24,154
Edo's girlfriend, the Ugolini girl.

261
00:31:24,189 --> 00:31:27,249
Eva? She's very nice.

262
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:30,591
He seems happy with her.

263
00:31:30,628 --> 00:31:33,688
I wouldn't be surprised

264
00:31:33,731 --> 00:31:36,791
if they made
an important announcement soon.

265
00:31:36,835 --> 00:31:40,202
The perfect wedding for her
and her family.

266
00:31:42,373 --> 00:31:46,969
Marriage: Number 36 on the Lotto.

267
00:31:47,011 --> 00:31:48,478
That should be lucky!

268
00:31:53,885 --> 00:31:57,218
Let's carry on the family tradition.

269
00:31:57,255 --> 00:31:58,552
Give it to her from me.

270
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,148
Thank you.

271
00:32:28,786 --> 00:32:31,220
Ida, it's bustling!

272
00:32:31,256 --> 00:32:34,953
We're almost done, Madam.
The chef's been cooking for two hours.

273
00:33:08,426 --> 00:33:09,620
Mamma!

274
00:33:11,296 --> 00:33:13,059
Why are you here?

275
00:33:14,632 --> 00:33:17,829
Remember Antonio?
You met on Grandpa's birthday.

276
00:33:19,003 --> 00:33:20,766
Yes.

277
00:33:26,578 --> 00:33:28,546
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Madam.

278
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,241
Excuse me.

279
00:33:31,516 --> 00:33:34,952
Since I tried his cooking,
I fell in love with him.

280
00:33:34,986 --> 00:33:37,477
Did you prepare all this
on your own?

281
00:33:37,522 --> 00:33:39,319
No, Franco helped me.

282
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:42,521
Russian salad...

283
00:33:44,696 --> 00:33:48,427
- Why don't you try?
- I don't know how...

284
00:33:48,466 --> 00:33:52,800
- She's a great cook. Go on, Mamma!
- Give it a go. It's not difficult.

285
00:33:57,675 --> 00:34:00,371
- It looks dangerous.
- It isn't.

286
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,948
Be brave.

287
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,481
I'll help you.

288
00:34:10,955 --> 00:34:14,322
- Hi, Franco.
- Good evening.

289
00:34:25,536 --> 00:34:28,300
- Perfect, isn't it?
- Perfect!

290
00:35:20,591 --> 00:35:22,218
Mamma...

291
00:35:23,294 --> 00:35:25,057
Mamma...

292
00:35:25,096 --> 00:35:27,087
Were you sleeping?

293
00:35:32,236 --> 00:35:34,101
Good idea.

294
00:35:34,138 --> 00:35:36,072
You won't get any peace tonight.

295
00:35:43,815 --> 00:35:46,511
Do you miss Russia?

296
00:35:46,551 --> 00:35:48,109
Sometimes.

297
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:57,283
You know...

298
00:35:57,328 --> 00:36:00,195
great things are happening there.

299
00:36:00,231 --> 00:36:02,461
Sweetheart...

300
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,559
Bye.

301
00:37:23,214 --> 00:37:26,513
- How is the party going?
- Very well, Madam.

302
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:33,648
Are you tired, Ida?

303
00:37:34,892 --> 00:37:38,988
No, we've had tougher ones.
Anyway, Edo is so happy.

304
00:37:40,097 --> 00:37:44,329
Please sit with me.
Tell me what's going on.

305
00:37:44,368 --> 00:37:46,632
Edo has spent all evening with Eva.

306
00:37:46,671 --> 00:37:49,231
He left her only to try and take

307
00:37:49,273 --> 00:37:51,833
his chef friend away from the kitchen.

308
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:53,867
He thinks very highly of him.

309
00:37:53,911 --> 00:37:56,846
Luckily, Mr. Tancredi is in London.

310
00:37:56,881 --> 00:38:00,783
He doesn't really like evenings
like these.

311
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:27,107
- Shall I close the curtains?
- Yes, thanks.

312
00:38:41,225 --> 00:38:44,126
Did you see the wonderful dish
your son's friend sent you?

313
00:38:55,072 --> 00:38:58,041
The party cost more than we'd agreed.

314
00:38:58,075 --> 00:39:01,067
It was a lovely evening.

315
00:39:01,112 --> 00:39:03,205
Edo was so happy.

316
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:05,477
A shame you weren't there.

317
00:39:05,516 --> 00:39:08,110
Do you think he wants to marry her?

318
00:39:08,152 --> 00:39:12,111
Your mother is convinced.

319
00:39:12,156 --> 00:39:14,021
Elisabetta thinks so too.

320
00:39:15,626 --> 00:39:17,753
How is Betta?

321
00:39:17,795 --> 00:39:20,764
I thought she looked well;
maybe a bit sad.

322
00:39:20,798 --> 00:39:23,164
I think she wants to get back
with Gregorio.

323
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,328
She told me
you're picking her up tomorrow.

324
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:29,066
Yes, after lunch with Rori.

325
00:39:29,106 --> 00:39:33,338
I have to admit I was wrong. Going to
London was the right thing for her.

326
00:39:33,377 --> 00:39:36,938
She likes it there.
She seems more motivated.

327
00:39:38,783 --> 00:39:42,514
I don't think she will go back
to Gregorio.

328
00:39:42,553 --> 00:39:45,021
She doesn't love him.

329
00:39:45,056 --> 00:39:46,353
Ida?

330
00:39:48,526 --> 00:39:50,460
Here.

331
00:39:52,296 --> 00:39:54,321
What does that mean?

332
00:39:59,203 --> 00:40:01,831
What does Edo think of selling?

333
00:40:01,872 --> 00:40:04,670
He is slowly coming to terms with it.

334
00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:07,610
He can't remain anchored to the past.

335
00:40:07,645 --> 00:40:11,376
Gianluca thinks that selling
is the only sensible option.

336
00:40:11,415 --> 00:40:14,873
And what do you think
about his restaurant idea?

337
00:40:14,919 --> 00:40:16,318
It's his money!

338
00:40:19,857 --> 00:40:23,452
You know what I think
about my father's decision?

339
00:40:23,494 --> 00:40:25,985
Edo isn't at all ready

340
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,726
to make decisions
about the company.

341
00:40:28,766 --> 00:40:31,997
He still needs a lot of guidance.

342
00:40:41,779 --> 00:40:45,374
Edoardo's mother has confirmed
three people for one o'clock.

343
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:47,247
Yes, I know.

344
00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:49,377
- What's she like?
- Who?

345
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,082
Mrs. Recchi.
Is she a nice person?

346
00:40:53,424 --> 00:40:55,119
She's nice.

347
00:40:58,129 --> 00:40:59,926
Can I have the press?

348
00:41:02,433 --> 00:41:03,559
Thanks.

349
00:41:17,148 --> 00:41:20,015
What are you charging Edo
for the party?

350
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:22,451
It was my gift to him.

351
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:33,191
Leghorn-style cod.
This goes onto the menu.

352
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,061
We did it!

353
00:41:43,307 --> 00:41:48,108
1995 Bergheim Riesling Altenberg.

354
00:41:48,145 --> 00:41:49,737
Excellent.

355
00:41:50,915 --> 00:41:54,612
The first time my son mentioned Emma

356
00:41:54,652 --> 00:41:57,587
was when we were at La Scala,
on St. Ambrose's feast day.

357
00:41:57,621 --> 00:41:59,919
You were still in Russia.

358
00:41:59,957 --> 00:42:04,656
Tancredi said, "Mamma, I'm marrying
a woman more beautiful than you."

359
00:42:04,695 --> 00:42:06,993
Naturally, I didn't believe him.

360
00:42:11,035 --> 00:42:13,128
To the Recchi wives!

361
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,172
Coming here today was a great idea.

362
00:42:22,213 --> 00:42:25,444
Edo is right to believe
in his friend.

363
00:42:25,483 --> 00:42:27,246
He's a real talent.

364
00:42:27,284 --> 00:42:29,013
I'm worried they're pushing it a bit.

365
00:42:30,988 --> 00:42:34,480
The idea of the restaurant
was rather rushed.

366
00:42:34,525 --> 00:42:39,121
Too much enthusiasm
can cause one not to think straight.

367
00:42:39,163 --> 00:42:42,257
Edoardo is an intelligent man.

368
00:42:42,299 --> 00:42:44,130
He knows what he's doing.

369
00:42:45,402 --> 00:42:49,532
Marinated egg yolk, pea cream
and zucchini flowers;

370
00:42:49,573 --> 00:42:54,374
prawns with ratatouille
and sweet-and-sour sauce;

371
00:42:54,411 --> 00:42:56,811
and mixed fish
with crunchy vegetables.

372
00:42:56,847 --> 00:42:58,747
Enjoy your meal.

373
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,545
Where would you like to live?

374
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:08,149
I wouldn't mind London.

375
00:43:08,192 --> 00:43:11,821
I know a law firm
where I could be an apprentice.

376
00:43:11,862 --> 00:43:13,853
I love the city...

377
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,707
Welcome, ladies.

378
00:44:04,748 --> 00:44:08,377
Antonio, this is Edo's grandmother.
You already know Emma.

379
00:44:08,419 --> 00:44:11,684
- How do you do?
- An excellent meal.

380
00:44:11,722 --> 00:44:14,748
I heard of your project
with my grandson.

381
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:18,592
I'd be happy to give my opinion
regarding the furnishing.

382
00:44:18,629 --> 00:44:21,564
Thank you.
And thanks for coming.

383
00:44:28,072 --> 00:44:30,905
They seemed happy.

384
00:44:30,941 --> 00:44:33,432
I think so.

385
00:44:33,477 --> 00:44:35,741
I made prawns for your mother.

386
00:44:40,417 --> 00:44:43,545
I know my father
only listens to you,

387
00:44:43,587 --> 00:44:45,487
but I'll try and tell him.

388
00:44:50,628 --> 00:44:52,687
Rori, excuse me a moment.

389
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:01,930
Am I interrupting?

390
00:45:01,972 --> 00:45:05,931
- I'd like to thank you. You are great.
- Thanks.

391
00:45:05,976 --> 00:45:09,002
The risotto, the prawns,
the vegetables...

392
00:45:09,046 --> 00:45:10,775
they were exquisite.

393
00:45:10,814 --> 00:45:13,749
- I grow the vegetables myself.
- Really? Where?

394
00:45:13,784 --> 00:45:16,344
Near Sanremo, in the countryside,

395
00:45:16,387 --> 00:45:19,356
where your son and I plan
to set up our restaurant.

396
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:22,325
How will you manage not being here?

397
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:26,625
Hey, Franco, let me do that.

398
00:45:26,664 --> 00:45:27,961
Good evening, Madam.

399
00:45:27,998 --> 00:45:29,989
I'll go on Thursdays
when we are closed here,

400
00:45:30,034 --> 00:45:32,662
and between shifts whenever I can.

401
00:45:34,471 --> 00:45:37,702
- See you soon.
- With pleasure.

402
00:45:37,741 --> 00:45:39,208
Here I am!

403
00:46:51,048 --> 00:46:53,448
Mamma! Grandma!

404
00:46:54,985 --> 00:46:57,112
How wonderful to see you.

405
00:47:02,393 --> 00:47:04,827
- How was the trip?
- Fine.

406
00:47:08,265 --> 00:47:10,460
- How are you?
- Very well.

407
00:47:12,736 --> 00:47:14,670
Betta!

408
00:47:22,746 --> 00:47:25,647
Why did you come?

409
00:47:25,682 --> 00:47:28,913
What do you mean, why?
What have you done?

410
00:47:28,952 --> 00:47:31,284
- Goodbye.
- What?

411
00:47:31,321 --> 00:47:32,913
Shall we go?

412
00:48:05,289 --> 00:48:09,020
I'm sorry I missed Eva's party.

413
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:13,621
Edo's crazy about Antonio, right?
They want to open a restaurant.

414
00:48:13,664 --> 00:48:16,428
He wants me to stop off
on my way to Nice.

415
00:48:16,467 --> 00:48:18,628
- For your exhibition?
- Yes.

416
00:48:23,073 --> 00:48:26,236
- Can I tell you something?
- Of course.

417
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,711
I left Gregorio for her.

418
00:48:39,923 --> 00:48:42,483
It's not a passing thing, I'm sure.

419
00:48:48,031 --> 00:48:50,022
Do you like her?

420
00:48:50,067 --> 00:48:52,797
She's beautiful.

421
00:48:52,836 --> 00:48:54,565
Very beautiful.

422
00:48:55,706 --> 00:48:58,698
I don't want to tell dad,
or Gianluca.

423
00:48:58,742 --> 00:49:00,607
They wouldn't understand.

424
00:49:04,448 --> 00:49:07,747
Here, she looks amazing.

425
00:49:07,784 --> 00:49:09,217
Why don't you come to Nice with me?

426
00:49:14,525 --> 00:49:18,518
- I might.
- We can be together.

427
00:49:47,324 --> 00:49:50,418
<i>Can I offer you something to drink?</i>

428
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,690
<i>Why don't you come with me?</i>

429
00:49:52,729 --> 00:49:55,527
<i>We can look for a space</i>
<i>for my exhibition.</i>

430
00:49:55,566 --> 00:49:59,468
<i>We'll leave on Tuesday,</i>
<i>Sanremo to Nice.</i>

431
00:49:59,503 --> 00:50:01,733
<i>What will you do</i>
<i>when we're all in London?</i>

432
00:50:01,772 --> 00:50:06,072
<i>I grow the vegetables myself,</i>
<i>near Sanremo.</i>

433
00:50:06,109 --> 00:50:08,600
<i>Her name's Angaharad,</i>
<i>she's my teacher.</i>

434
00:50:08,645 --> 00:50:11,842
<i>Edo can't stay anchored</i>
<i>to the past, things change.</i>

435
00:50:43,046 --> 00:50:45,173
Edo, darling...

436
00:50:45,215 --> 00:50:47,080
I'm out of town.

437
00:50:47,117 --> 00:50:49,711
I've decided
to go to see Betta in Nice.

438
00:50:51,722 --> 00:50:52,984
But don't tell her.

439
00:50:56,693 --> 00:50:58,490
I'll call you later.

440
00:53:14,765 --> 00:53:17,461
- I'll be right with you, Madam.
- Thank you.

441
00:54:01,244 --> 00:54:03,804
Mrs. Recchi!

442
00:54:03,847 --> 00:54:05,815
How come you're here?

443
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:09,182
I'm going to visit Betta.

444
00:54:09,219 --> 00:54:10,982
Oh, the exhibition in Nice.
Edo told me about it.

445
00:54:12,856 --> 00:54:16,223
- How about you?
- The restaurant is closed today.

446
00:54:16,259 --> 00:54:18,454
Right, it's Thursday...

447
00:54:18,495 --> 00:54:20,395
the countryside... the vegetables.

448
00:54:21,398 --> 00:54:24,196
If you aren't too busy,
why don't you come with me?

449
00:54:25,435 --> 00:54:27,835
It's just a slight detour.

450
00:54:27,871 --> 00:54:30,635
I'll show you where Edo and I
will open the restaurant.

451
00:54:30,674 --> 00:54:32,403
He's already been there a few times.

452
00:54:33,443 --> 00:54:35,104
Okay.

453
00:54:36,112 --> 00:54:37,943
My truck's there.

454
00:55:14,284 --> 00:55:17,811
- Were you born here?
- No, my father's from here.

455
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:23,623
The land is my grandfather's.
I started cooking here as a child.

456
00:55:25,061 --> 00:55:26,858
I love cooking,

457
00:55:26,897 --> 00:55:29,388
but I'm not as good as you.

458
00:55:29,432 --> 00:55:32,629
Edo tells me the opposite.
He always talks about you.

459
00:55:32,669 --> 00:55:34,102
And he talks to me about you.

460
00:55:35,472 --> 00:55:39,636
He'll be happy you came.
