1
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,491
"You cannot walk
away from love."

2
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,864
That was the advertisement
in a Baltimore newspaper.

3
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,774
And that is how he found her.

4
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:37,774
She was a young woman
in need of a husband.

5
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,083
He was a man who wanted a wife.

6
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:03,039
Too late to talk
sense to him now.

7
00:02:03,107 --> 00:02:05,440
You can't marry her.
You've never met her.

8
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:09,503
I meet her today. The boat from America
comes at 6:00, we marry at 9:00...

9
00:02:09,647 --> 00:02:11,171
...by 10:00,
I'm back at work.

10
00:02:11,616 --> 00:02:14,083
Ridiculous.
This is ridiculous.

11
00:02:14,152 --> 00:02:18,679
A man needs a wife, isn't that what
you've been telling me? I sent for one.

12
00:02:18,756 --> 00:02:19,745
From America.

13
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:21,383
What does she look like?

14
00:02:22,993 --> 00:02:26,190
Comes a day in every man's life
when a band is playing...

15
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:30,701
...and he's the only one who can hear it.
Today is your day.

16
00:02:31,202 --> 00:02:32,863
I love you,
woman.

17
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:35,094
She is not beautiful.

18
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:37,534
She is not meant
to be beautiful...

19
00:02:37,608 --> 00:02:40,839
...just kind, true and young enough
to bear children.

20
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,814
Go on. The sun will be up any minute.
The boat will be coming in.

21
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,983
But what about love, Luis?
Doesn't love come into this at all?

22
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:55,552
Love is not for me,
Alan.

23
00:02:55,726 --> 00:02:57,957
Love is for those
people who believe in it.

24
00:02:59,431 --> 00:03:00,522
Let's go.

25
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:05,098
Why are you laughing at me?
You've been laughing at me all morning.

26
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,695
Never mind.
You go! Go on!

27
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:28,083
No,
this is not a love story.

28
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:33,417
Butitis a story aboutlove,
and the powerit has over ourlife.

29
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:37,192
The power to heal or destroy.

30
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:48,929
and this is where
the story begins.

31
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,448
Mr. Vargas?

32
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:10,216
Luis Vargas?

33
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:13,886
You don't recognize me,
do you?

34
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,335
Miss Russell?

35
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:21,732
Yes.

36
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,574
Julia Russell?

37
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:30,408
But this,
this picture--

38
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:34,542
I've deceived you.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.

39
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,980
I was unsure.
You see...

40
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,389
...l didn't want you interested in me
just because I owned a pretty face.

41
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:47,761
So I sent another woman's photograph
and not my own.

42
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,266
I see.

43
00:05:52,537 --> 00:05:56,199
I hope you forgive me.
I meant to write many times. I tried.

44
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:58,932
But my courage failed me.
So l....

45
00:06:05,716 --> 00:06:07,047
And....

46
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:14,881
Now I stand before you as I am,
and you know the worst.

47
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:16,386
No, no.

48
00:06:17,562 --> 00:06:19,052
Not the worst at all.

49
00:06:20,732 --> 00:06:23,894
Only,
not what I was expecting.

50
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:28,066
If my deception has altered
your intentions...

51
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:29,900
...
if you're not satisfied--

52
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,235
No,
it isn't that.

53
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:34,574
...l am determined to make my way back
to my home in Delaware.

54
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:37,011
-If you say so, I will.
-Miss Russell....

55
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:40,081
Miss Russell...

56
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:45,586
...
you have been honest with me.

57
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:48,588
I will be honest with you,
too.

58
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:52,996
I will admit to a
deception of my own.

59
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:58,961
You are exactly the image
of your photograph.

60
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:00,696
Yes, I am.

61
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:04,201
But I wrote to you
that I am a clerk...

62
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:07,266
...in a coffee export house.
I am not.

63
00:07:10,482 --> 00:07:11,915
I own the house.

64
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:14,377
The business is my own.

65
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:22,285
You did not want me
to be interested in you...

66
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,124
...just because you owned
a pretty bank account.

67
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:27,655
Yes.

68
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:33,497
Then we have
something in common.

69
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:37,100
We are both not to be trusted.

70
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:46,343
Of course, if my deception
has altered your intentions...

71
00:07:48,987 --> 00:07:52,650
...if you are not interested
in marrying a wealthy man....

72
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,855
No,
I think I could manage.

73
00:07:58,362 --> 00:08:01,297
If you could manage
a somewhat prettier wife.

74
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:05,766
I'll make the effort.

75
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:22,415
Miss Russell.

76
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:25,653
Mr. Vargas.

77
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:30,389
Now we have all the time in the world
to get to know each other.

78
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:33,162
No,
not all the time.

79
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,900
We are going to
be married at 9:00.

80
00:08:39,804 --> 00:08:42,136
Then we'd better hurry.

81
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:55,474
"Take this ring...

82
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:58,184
"...
as a sign of my love...

83
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,723
"...
and fidelity...

84
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:03,457
"...to you."

85
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:29,317
Music!

86
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:30,718
Music!

87
00:09:39,863 --> 00:09:42,354
Ladies and gentlemen,
a toast!

88
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,497
To our groom and
his beautiful...

89
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:49,171
...
enchanting bride!

90
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,939
Will you dance with me?

91
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:57,578
Dance?

92
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,074
I don't dance.

93
00:10:01,652 --> 00:10:03,415
I say you do.

94
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,561
May their life together be like this dance,
harmonious, smooth.

95
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:15,597
Dance for life
never ending and--

96
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,564
Alan,
enough is enough.

97
00:10:17,635 --> 00:10:18,931
I'm almost through.

98
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:21,835
You're through now.
Sit down.

99
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:13,851
-Good luck to you.
-Thank you.

100
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:47,986
Would you like to see the house?

101
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:50,891
Oh, no.
I can see it tomorrow.

102
00:11:54,832 --> 00:11:57,824
You must give me a few moments.
I'm shy of these things.

103
00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:03,598
I will give you as many moments,
days, nights as you need.

104
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,875
When you want me
to come to you...

105
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:10,044
...l will.

106
00:12:11,248 --> 00:12:12,579
Not before.

107
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,478
You would do that for me?

108
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:23,152
If you say so,
yes.

109
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:31,598
Then...

110
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,166
...
l will say good night.

111
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,377
The room is there,
to the right.

112
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:44,337
I think I'll find it.

113
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,252
Awake at last.

114
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,953
The day is half-gone.

115
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,627
I'm sorry.
I'm not dressed.

116
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:10,496
I could wait outside,
but the coffee would get cold.

117
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:12,267
No,
it's all right.

118
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,261
If someone brought me my coffee
every morning before I dressed...

119
00:14:16,373 --> 00:14:18,399
...
l would be very happy.

120
00:14:18,976 --> 00:14:20,466
It would change the day.

121
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:21,670
But...

122
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,348
...
you only drink tea.

123
00:14:24,415 --> 00:14:26,075
I do? No.

124
00:14:26,851 --> 00:14:30,684
When I wrote I worked in a coffee
company, you wrote back--

125
00:14:30,755 --> 00:14:32,415
That was my sister.

126
00:14:33,223 --> 00:14:37,752
She believed coffee to be a sinful
pleasure so I pretended to agree.

127
00:14:37,828 --> 00:14:42,059
She read all my letters to you,
so I could not always be truthful.

128
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:49,795
All the more reason to forget them.
That's all behind you.

129
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:53,637
What do you think?

130
00:14:55,313 --> 00:14:56,803
About what?

131
00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:02,147
Do you believe as
my sister does...

132
00:15:02,886 --> 00:15:06,219
...that pleasure
could ever be sinful?

133
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:07,140
Why did you choose
an American wife?

134
00:16:09,286 --> 00:16:11,516
Here,
we are the past.

135
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:14,920
There,
you are the future.

136
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:20,454
Why did you choose to leave it?

137
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:23,626
To escape the future.

138
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:27,993
To become someone else,
I think.

139
00:16:31,175 --> 00:16:34,007
I am someone else with you.

140
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,040
Someone more like...

141
00:16:38,882 --> 00:16:40,213
...myself.

142
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:00,664
There,
in his arms...

143
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,096
...
she became someone else.

144
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,866
Someone more like herself.

145
00:19:20,453 --> 00:19:23,080
I'm telling you,
I've never been happier.

146
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,223
There's no such thing
as happily married.

147
00:19:26,326 --> 00:19:29,158
It's an oxymoron,
like "happily dead".

148
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,325
I thought you'd be finding your way
back to the whores by now.

149
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:36,231
Seeing a little "Creole" time.

150
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:37,394
Not anymore.

151
00:19:37,537 --> 00:19:39,868
You've had her for
yourself long enough.

152
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:41,803
When do we get to see her again?

153
00:19:41,874 --> 00:19:43,808
We're going to the
theatre next week.

154
00:19:43,876 --> 00:19:46,037
An American touring company
she wants to see.

155
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:47,374
Join us.

156
00:19:55,253 --> 00:19:59,246
Soon comes the morning
when the knell is rung...

157
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:01,787
...
to take my living breath.

158
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,125
Come, come,
the night is almost done.

159
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:10,426
Satan is near!

160
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,203
The shrieking,
grim and...

161
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:16,537
...hideous brim
of hell to uncover.

162
00:20:16,775 --> 00:20:19,608
Come, or you will
share her wretched end.

163
00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:22,607
Hellhound!
Abominable monster!

164
00:20:22,948 --> 00:20:25,109
Would that I had
never been born!

165
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:31,617
Wonderful.

166
00:20:31,957 --> 00:20:33,289
Disgusting.

167
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,450
Cheap melodrama.

168
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:41,726
Was it we who forced our way to you?
Who was it sent her to her ruin?

169
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:43,398
I...

170
00:20:44,636 --> 00:20:45,967
...or you?

171
00:20:46,806 --> 00:20:50,298
What evil thing has
risen from the ground?

172
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:54,802
Father, let angels now
have charge of me...

173
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:57,880
...encamped around
heavenly company.

174
00:20:58,251 --> 00:21:00,048
She is condemned to die.

175
00:21:01,486 --> 00:21:04,080
She is redeemed on high!

176
00:21:04,322 --> 00:21:06,154
Hither, to me!

177
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:20,499
Julia, my dear,
you look flushed.

178
00:21:21,107 --> 00:21:24,098
-Are you all right?
-Yes, it's the theatre.

179
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,741
I love it...

180
00:21:26,011 --> 00:21:27,673
...
even the cheap melodrama.

181
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:31,710
Will you excuse me?

182
00:21:38,191 --> 00:21:40,283
Does she suffer from fevers?

183
00:21:40,893 --> 00:21:43,555
She suffers from a
little too much rouge.

184
00:21:43,796 --> 00:21:47,288
Nonsense.
A lady does not wear rouge.

185
00:21:47,633 --> 00:21:49,293
No,
a lady doesn't.

186
00:21:49,635 --> 00:21:53,298
And a lady does not wander through
the theater alone, either.

187
00:21:55,308 --> 00:21:56,638
Excuse me.

188
00:22:01,246 --> 00:22:04,409
Perhaps you will find the second act
more appealing.

189
00:22:58,337 --> 00:23:01,363
Excuse me, sir!
The public is not allowed backstage.

190
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,407
Don't touch me,
sir.

191
00:23:03,475 --> 00:23:05,409
That is my wife,
damn it!

192
00:23:05,478 --> 00:23:07,638
Luis,
you've come to my rescue...

193
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,912
...
just like a play....

194
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:13,749
What are you doing here?

195
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,878
Isn't it exciting?
Look at all these mysterious contraptions.

196
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:21,820
-Who was that man?
-What man? I was lost, that's all.

197
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,021
You made my heart stop.

198
00:23:24,163 --> 00:23:27,155
Feel my heart.
Feel how fast it's beating?

199
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:33,092
Christ.

200
00:23:33,905 --> 00:23:35,635
You'll be the death of me.

201
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:40,938
I hope so.

202
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:46,139
Places, please.

203
00:23:46,284 --> 00:23:48,775
Ladies and gentlemen,
places for act two.

204
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:58,655
Take me home now.

205
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:11,502
My own dearestsister.

206
00:24:11,644 --> 00:24:16,877
I can't understand why you treat me thus.
Itis many weeks now since you left.

207
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,579
In all that time, no word from you
to tell me ofyoursafe arrival...

208
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,813
...whetheryou met Mr. Vargas,
whether the marriage has taken place.

209
00:24:26,157 --> 00:24:27,886
What am I to think?

210
00:24:28,394 --> 00:24:31,157
I have contacted the
embassy in Havana...

211
00:24:31,364 --> 00:24:33,730
...and the authorities
there in Santiago.

212
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:36,597
I know how you feel about her,
but...

213
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:38,635
...
you have to write.

214
00:24:41,107 --> 00:24:43,769
You have to,
before she has the police on us.

215
00:24:44,175 --> 00:24:46,508
You're right.
I've been unkind to her.

216
00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:50,142
Although she has
never been kind to me.

217
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,076
Just do it.

218
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,885
Do it,
and then it's done.

219
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:59,947
No, no, no!

220
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:05,627
It's all right.
It's me, Luis.

221
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:08,163
You were dreaming.

222
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:11,433
Are you all right?

223
00:25:15,808 --> 00:25:18,139
That's it.

224
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:21,138
You were just dreaming.

225
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:25,313
It's all right.

226
00:25:27,118 --> 00:25:28,950
It was just a dream.

227
00:25:29,288 --> 00:25:32,552
A bad one,
that's all.

228
00:25:40,933 --> 00:25:42,127
It was just a dream.

229
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:44,695
You okay?
You need something?

230
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:45,759
You.

231
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:47,903
I'm sorry.

232
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,400
You are here with me.
Secure.

233
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:52,473
You're all right.

234
00:25:52,912 --> 00:25:54,435
Will you stay?

235
00:25:54,613 --> 00:25:55,944
Of course.

236
00:25:57,148 --> 00:25:58,480
Of course.

237
00:26:00,286 --> 00:26:01,946
It's all right.

238
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:35,579
Luis, don't go.

239
00:26:37,923 --> 00:26:40,585
How is the queen of the house
this morning?

240
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,992
Look. See?
I've done it.

241
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:52,495
This is for the best.
Thank you.

242
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:56,571
-I'll have Sara post it this morning.
-No need. I can do it myself.

243
00:26:56,642 --> 00:26:58,633
I haven't addressed it.

244
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:02,703
I have the address at the office.
Then it's on its way.

245
00:27:11,424 --> 00:27:13,186
What will you do today?

246
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:16,625
I'm going to an English dressmaker
at the Plaza Vieja.

247
00:27:19,697 --> 00:27:20,857
You'll need money.

248
00:27:22,635 --> 00:27:25,330
Sign here,
Señora.

249
00:27:26,972 --> 00:27:30,271
Is this for both your personal
and business account?

250
00:27:30,341 --> 00:27:31,899
Yes, thank you.

251
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:35,270
I want my wife to have free use
of all my accounts.

252
00:27:35,681 --> 00:27:36,739
There you are.

253
00:27:36,816 --> 00:27:39,079
Should I sign using
my Christian name?

254
00:27:39,518 --> 00:27:40,984
No,
your married name.

255
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:44,687
You must remember to repeat
the signature exactly...

256
00:27:45,023 --> 00:27:46,855
...
each time you draw a check.

257
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:48,919
I will try.

258
00:27:59,771 --> 00:28:01,433
Oh, man!

259
00:28:10,415 --> 00:28:12,781
So, Luis,
is it love after all...

260
00:28:13,018 --> 00:28:14,985
...
or is it just lust?

261
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:17,453
Is there a difference?

262
00:28:17,755 --> 00:28:18,950
Oh, yes.

263
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:22,787
To love someone is to give
and then want to give more.

264
00:28:23,428 --> 00:28:24,953
And lust?

265
00:28:25,431 --> 00:28:26,728
What is lust,
Alan?

266
00:28:27,532 --> 00:28:30,695
Lust is to take
and then take more.

267
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:33,800
To devour, to consume.
No logic, no reason.

268
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:37,005
So...give,
take.

269
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:39,175
Which is it?

270
00:28:39,645 --> 00:28:40,975
Both.

271
00:28:43,948 --> 00:28:45,940
I want to give her everything.

272
00:28:47,552 --> 00:28:49,817
And I want to take
everything from her.

273
00:28:51,056 --> 00:28:54,320
Oh, Luis.
You are a lost man.

274
00:28:54,894 --> 00:28:56,224
No, no.

275
00:28:58,263 --> 00:29:00,493
She is the one who
seems to be lost.

276
00:29:01,099 --> 00:29:04,762
How, why, I don't know.
But that will change.

277
00:29:06,004 --> 00:29:07,836
I can change that.

278
00:29:14,746 --> 00:29:15,805
Mr. Vargas?

279
00:29:18,283 --> 00:29:20,548
Walter Downs.
I didn't mean to startle you.

280
00:29:20,853 --> 00:29:23,446
-That's okay.
-I was told I could find you upstairs.

281
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:25,046
-How can I help?
-Small matter.

282
00:29:25,124 --> 00:29:28,059
Hardly worth your trouble.
I've been engaged by Miss Russell.

283
00:29:28,127 --> 00:29:29,252
You mean,
Julia?

284
00:29:29,595 --> 00:29:31,926
No, Emily.
Julia's sister.

285
00:29:32,196 --> 00:29:33,322
In Delaware.

286
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:35,263
I'm a private investigator.

287
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:37,568
I just arrived from Wilmington.

288
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:42,665
I understand.
I know Miss Russell was distressed.

289
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:45,710
But we wrote to her
several weeks ago.

290
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:50,605
I'm sure when she receives the letter,
she will be much relieved.

291
00:29:50,683 --> 00:29:52,707
Then Miss Julia is all right?

292
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:56,213
More than all right.
And more than Miss Julia.

293
00:29:56,621 --> 00:29:58,317
She's Señora Vargas,
my wife.

294
00:29:58,389 --> 00:29:59,879
So you are married?

295
00:30:02,627 --> 00:30:04,754
-That's good news.
-Happily married.

296
00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:06,387
I can see that.

297
00:30:06,498 --> 00:30:09,661
What a mystery a
happy marriage is.

298
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:12,703
The bloom in the cheek,
the spark in the eye.

299
00:30:13,571 --> 00:30:15,937
-It shows, I guess.
-Yes, indeed.

300
00:30:16,008 --> 00:30:18,203
Miss Russell will be
pleased to hear of it.

301
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,779
I'd appreciate
if you'd tell her.

302
00:30:20,846 --> 00:30:22,143
I will indeed.

303
00:30:23,848 --> 00:30:27,511
And I'll be even more convincing
when I've met your wife.

304
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,149
Yes, yes.

305
00:30:33,024 --> 00:30:33,956
Why not?

306
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:39,188
We will be home
Sunday afternoon.

307
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:41,796
You want to come
by for a coffee?

308
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:43,155
Yes, I will.

309
00:30:43,234 --> 00:30:46,636
Convey to your wife
how much I look forward to seeing her.

310
00:30:58,384 --> 00:31:00,544
Outside, please.
On the terrace.

311
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,150
Do as she says.

312
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,455
Just in time.

313
00:31:09,261 --> 00:31:12,424
This is for Sunday paseo,
and this one for weekdays.

314
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:15,022
Fine, fine.

315
00:31:16,201 --> 00:31:17,792
And the rest?

316
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:19,867
This one I like.

317
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:23,540
What do you mean?
There are seven days in a week.

318
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:26,667
Is there nothing in your trunk?

319
00:31:26,744 --> 00:31:30,511
Nothing good. Anyway,
I've lost the key.

320
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:34,176
We'll get a locksmith.
It's an easy job. Actually...

321
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:36,319
...
l'll do it myself.

322
00:31:37,723 --> 00:31:40,556
No, I want to show
you something. Come.

323
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:44,521
You must leave now.
I'm going to kiss my husband.

324
00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:47,098
Then we're going to take a bath.

325
00:32:04,183 --> 00:32:05,844
What do I smell?

326
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:07,951
My perfume.

327
00:32:08,252 --> 00:32:09,413
No.

328
00:32:11,322 --> 00:32:12,654
A cigar.

329
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:15,782
I tried one.

330
00:32:18,097 --> 00:32:19,587
One of my cigars?

331
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:22,731
I wanted the taste
of you in my mouth.

332
00:32:26,605 --> 00:32:28,596
You have no shame at all.

333
00:32:29,742 --> 00:32:32,040
There is no shame
in loving each other.

334
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:34,769
Do you love me?
Julia?

335
00:32:35,446 --> 00:32:37,107
Do you love me?

336
00:32:38,015 --> 00:32:40,245
Or are you not the loving kind?

337
00:33:20,325 --> 00:33:22,155
I forgot to tell you.

338
00:33:23,995 --> 00:33:26,486
We have a visitor
coming on Sunday.

339
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:29,165
We do?

340
00:33:30,202 --> 00:33:31,463
Yes...

341
00:33:31,603 --> 00:33:33,763
...a genuine private
investigator...

342
00:33:35,374 --> 00:33:37,534
...
all the way from Delaware.

343
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:41,475
So,
Emily sent him.

344
00:33:41,746 --> 00:33:44,511
Yeah.
Detective Downs.

345
00:33:44,817 --> 00:33:46,978
Detective Downs,
did you say?

346
00:33:47,085 --> 00:33:49,883
Don't worry,
he only needs to see that you're well...

347
00:33:50,588 --> 00:33:53,251
...
and happy and truly my wife.

348
00:33:54,358 --> 00:33:58,693
-Then this nonsense is over.
-When will that damn bird stop screaming?

349
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,992
Julia.

350
00:34:08,072 --> 00:34:10,735
Careful,
it's coming.

351
00:34:25,056 --> 00:34:26,717
Oh, no.

352
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:34,489
Don Luis, look.
He's dead.

353
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:37,324
He was just singing.

354
00:34:37,436 --> 00:34:39,768
He's not singing now,
is he?

355
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:43,802
Looks like he got his
little neck broken.

356
00:34:44,842 --> 00:34:48,677
Take him away.
I don't want Julia to see him.

357
00:35:41,565 --> 00:35:44,000
How does a person die
on this instrument?

358
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,402
I believe that...

359
00:35:50,174 --> 00:35:53,041
...the turning of the wheel
breaks one's neck.

360
00:35:54,212 --> 00:35:55,873
And if it doesn't?

361
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:58,779
Does one then strangle?

362
00:36:00,819 --> 00:36:02,081
Are you afraid?

363
00:36:05,556 --> 00:36:06,545
No.

364
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:09,282
Julia is not afraid.

365
00:36:11,262 --> 00:36:12,730
But Bonny is.

366
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:18,425
I don't understand.
Who is Bonny?

367
00:36:23,407 --> 00:36:24,875
Who is Bonny?

368
00:36:27,244 --> 00:36:28,905
I'm looking for Mr.
Vargas.

369
00:36:29,047 --> 00:36:31,344
Thatis a question
Luis would soon be asking.

370
00:36:37,355 --> 00:36:38,686
Mr. Vargas?

371
00:36:39,623 --> 00:36:40,954
My name is Russell.

372
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:43,226
Emily Russell.

373
00:36:43,527 --> 00:36:45,358
I am Julia's sister.

374
00:36:46,797 --> 00:36:51,791
So you understand how upset I was
to receive this letter.

375
00:36:52,237 --> 00:36:53,396
Upset?

376
00:36:53,704 --> 00:36:57,869
But...l thought you would be pleased
to receive it.

377
00:36:59,378 --> 00:37:01,208
This letter,
sir...

378
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,043
...written in answer to
the one I last sent...

379
00:37:05,384 --> 00:37:07,715
...and which is
signed in her name...

380
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:10,210
...
is not from Julia.

381
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:14,416
Of course it is.

382
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:16,253
I mailed it myself.

383
00:37:16,395 --> 00:37:18,420
It was not written by my sister.

384
00:37:18,496 --> 00:37:19,929
Miss Russell.

385
00:37:25,237 --> 00:37:27,728
I'm sorry.

386
00:37:27,905 --> 00:37:30,773
Don't be upset.
I swear to you--

387
00:37:30,842 --> 00:37:33,003
Swear as much as you like.

388
00:37:36,681 --> 00:37:40,172
That is not Julia's handwriting.

389
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:43,085
That is the handwriting
of a stranger.

390
00:37:43,688 --> 00:37:45,518
A person unknown.

391
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:48,014
At least to me.

392
00:38:17,121 --> 00:38:19,954
-Where is she?
-I was going to send for you.

393
00:38:20,025 --> 00:38:21,355
Where is she?

394
00:38:22,393 --> 00:38:24,224
Go away.
Get out!

395
00:38:35,306 --> 00:38:36,467
Where did she go?

396
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:40,534
I don't know. She sent me to
the post office. When I come back--

397
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:23,746
She's not coming back,
is she, Sara?

398
00:39:24,021 --> 00:39:25,489
She never was here.

399
00:39:27,592 --> 00:39:29,583
You've been married to a dream.

400
00:39:30,561 --> 00:39:32,826
A dream that stole your soul.

401
00:39:58,556 --> 00:40:00,889
Luis!
What is it?

402
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:10,898
Your wife appeared at five minutes to
three for a last-minute withdrawal.

403
00:40:11,235 --> 00:40:15,570
As you instructed,
I gave her full access to your accounts.

404
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:18,699
Your balance at closing was...

405
00:40:19,177 --> 00:40:22,340
...51 American dollars and 40 cents
in one account...

406
00:40:22,514 --> 00:40:24,344
...
ten dollars in the other.

407
00:40:29,887 --> 00:40:33,152
As I explained to your wife,
to close both out completely...

408
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:35,887
...your signature
would have been necessary.

409
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:42,896
I'm sorry.

410
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,561
Don Luis?

411
00:41:45,563 --> 00:41:47,895
God must have been angry with you
that day...

412
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,391
...he let you look
in that woman's face.

413
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:07,511
I want her back.
Sara...

414
00:42:10,087 --> 00:42:11,748
...
l want her back.

415
00:42:14,692 --> 00:42:18,219
No, cariño.
What for?

416
00:42:19,831 --> 00:42:22,322
What for you want
her back again?

417
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:00,132
No,
this is not a love story.

418
00:44:01,976 --> 00:44:04,137
Butitis a story aboutlove.

419
00:44:06,648 --> 00:44:10,378
about those who give in to it,
and the price they pay.

420
00:44:13,922 --> 00:44:17,152
and those who run away from it
because they are afraid...

421
00:44:18,726 --> 00:44:22,058
...or because they do not believe
they are worthy ofit.

422
00:44:24,766 --> 00:44:26,427
She ran away.

423
00:44:27,434 --> 00:44:28,766
He gave in.

424
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,500
Mr. Vargas?

425
00:44:32,473 --> 00:44:34,134
Walter Downs.

426
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:39,505
What a happy coincidence.

427
00:44:40,614 --> 00:44:41,945
Oh, yeah.

428
00:44:43,483 --> 00:44:45,145
I remember you.

429
00:44:51,058 --> 00:44:54,721
And the authorities
here could do nothing?

430
00:44:57,898 --> 00:44:59,559
After all...

431
00:45:01,402 --> 00:45:03,063
...
there was no crime.

432
00:45:04,438 --> 00:45:09,273
She was my wife.
She just took what I had given her.

433
00:45:12,012 --> 00:45:13,344
Your money.

434
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:16,849
And your love.

435
00:45:19,654 --> 00:45:21,382
And you did not suspect?

436
00:45:26,527 --> 00:45:31,362
It seems that I know a lot less
about women than I thought I did.

437
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:33,628
And I know too much.

438
00:45:34,034 --> 00:45:36,525
Consequently,
I've not much use for them...

439
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:38,862
...
apart from the necessities.

440
00:45:39,306 --> 00:45:42,469
For real intercourse,
I prefer the company of men.

441
00:45:43,844 --> 00:45:45,175
Listen to me.

442
00:45:47,014 --> 00:45:48,675
Could you find her?

443
00:45:52,552 --> 00:45:53,884
Perhaps.

444
00:45:55,723 --> 00:45:58,556
But I am,
at the moment...

445
00:45:58,659 --> 00:46:02,652
...engaged to find the real Julia,
the one you were meant to marry.

446
00:46:05,233 --> 00:46:06,893
Have you found her?

447
00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:10,059
Have you found her?

448
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:13,536
Not yet.

449
00:46:13,608 --> 00:46:15,802
If you do...
if you do...

450
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:19,409
...she might lead you
to the Julia I married.

451
00:46:20,848 --> 00:46:22,145
Perhaps.

452
00:46:23,284 --> 00:46:24,614
And vice versa.

453
00:46:27,487 --> 00:46:31,753
As much as you want I will pay,
if you can find her for me.

454
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,190
That's all I want.

455
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:37,788
Then I assume you have made up
your losses.

456
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:41,666
As much as you want,
I will pay, I said it.

457
00:46:42,036 --> 00:46:43,366
I will pay.

458
00:46:43,538 --> 00:46:45,869
Yes,
I believe you would.

459
00:46:46,708 --> 00:46:48,699
And if I did find your Julia?

460
00:46:49,043 --> 00:46:51,511
If I brought her to you...

461
00:46:52,313 --> 00:46:54,076
...
or you to her...

462
00:46:55,483 --> 00:46:58,145
...what good would
it possibly do you?

463
00:46:58,853 --> 00:46:59,911
Money's gone.

464
00:47:01,822 --> 00:47:03,154
The love...

465
00:47:03,924 --> 00:47:05,221
...ruined.

466
00:47:06,627 --> 00:47:08,857
What could you
possibly want with her?

467
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:12,829
What could you possibly want?

468
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:20,835
I want to kill her.

469
00:47:42,462 --> 00:47:44,931
Yes,
I do recall this lady.

470
00:47:45,366 --> 00:47:47,697
Slim and dark and very.
...

471
00:47:48,536 --> 00:47:52,733
I remember, coming along the deck
and the breeze catching her skirt.

472
00:47:53,206 --> 00:47:54,697
She was coming towards me.

473
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:59,574
She quickly held it down with her hand
and as she passed, she smiled.

474
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,813
I believe she was traveling
with a troupe of American actors...

475
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:05,079
...
touring the island.

476
00:48:05,353 --> 00:48:07,514
Oh, yes,
I remember.

477
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:10,983
She rolled up some
lettuce in her napkin.

478
00:48:11,726 --> 00:48:15,786
I thoughtit was strange.
She explained it was for her bird.

479
00:48:16,063 --> 00:48:18,054
She was traveling with a bird.

480
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:21,500
Oh, yes.
I remember her.

481
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:24,371
A lady with a birdcage...

482
00:48:25,306 --> 00:48:27,364
...but this
doesn'tlook like her.

483
00:48:27,942 --> 00:48:30,239
She was young and very pretty.

484
00:48:31,779 --> 00:48:33,302
Yes,
that's her.

485
00:48:35,049 --> 00:48:37,813
and the real Julia never appears,
because...

486
00:48:38,518 --> 00:48:39,679
...she is dead.

487
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:45,224
-You mean murder.
-Yes.

488
00:48:46,828 --> 00:48:49,023
She could have
had an accomplice.

489
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:51,460
These women often
have an accomplice.

490
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:54,462
Someone she might
use and then discard.

491
00:48:54,936 --> 00:48:59,270
Someone who might even now be
in pursuit of her, just as you and I are.

492
00:49:01,442 --> 00:49:03,034
This is where it happened.

493
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,701
Here in Havana.

494
00:50:06,273 --> 00:50:08,605
This way, gentlemen.
Welcome to Havana.

495
00:50:08,976 --> 00:50:11,444
Mr.
Downs will be in room 37...

496
00:50:11,512 --> 00:50:16,174
...and Mr. Vargas will be just down the hall
in room 42.
