00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,040

00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,076
(Low chatter)

20
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,909
- (Chuckles) Yeah.
- I know you're a good person.

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,036
(Chuckling)

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,392
So how long are you staying in Rome?

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,516
I fly back to Moscow tomorrow.

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,116
What a coincidence! So do I.

25
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,989
- You fly to Moscow?
- Back to Spain.

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,116
(Laughs)

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,829
- This is my hotel.
- Mine is down there on the left.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,151
- So, this is closer.
- For you, yes.

29
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,834
- For you too.
- No.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,869
Come on. Please, just a little stop,
to drink the last one.

31
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,156
We drank plenty in the bar.

32
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,950
Mm, yes, but we only talked
about Russia and Spain, not about us.

33
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,190
I prefer not to talk about us.

34
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,276
It's a deal.

35
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,237
- What is?
- We don't talk.

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,995
We can stay without talking,
you know? And even better.

37
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,799
See, that's my room.
It's got two flags.

38
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,916
Must be a reason, no?

39
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,834
Yes, one for Europe and one for Rome.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,639
I'm talking
about what's in the middle.

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,553
- The middle flag is missing.
- Uh-huh, exactly.

42
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,269
That's because of you. You have
to come up and hang it there.

43
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,591
- And what do I hang there?
- I don't know.

44
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,548
Your clothes, for example.
You are long enough.

45
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,951
Hm. Come on.

46
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,795
(Chuckles) I've never gone
up to a woman's room.

47
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,235
It's just a hotel room in Rome.

48
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,032
(Grunts)

49
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,191
(Chuckles)

50
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,310
If you keep pulling, you'll win
and we'll end up in your hotel.

51
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,632
- You choose.
- (Both chuckle)

52
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,789
(Key in lock)

53
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,794
- (Door creaks)
- (Chuckles)

54
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,190
(Keys jangle)

55
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,313
- Drink?
- Wine.

56
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,232
Wine.

57
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,635
Sorry, what was your name?

58
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,388
I told you twice already.

59
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,677
Maybe at the third time I get it.

60
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,990
Natasha.

61
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,630
Natasha.
Was that the name you said before?

62
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,558
But you are not saying it right.
It's Nata-sha.

63
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,073
Sha.

64
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,878
- Sha.
- Sha.

65
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,076
- Sha.
- Sha.

66
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,277
Mm. And you are Alba,
which is Spanish for dawn.

67
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,955
That's my big moment. You'll see.

68
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,320
(Clock chiming)

69
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,710
Tonight is the first night
of the summer.

70
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,117
Ah, yes, that's right, in Europe.

71
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,114
In Russia, summer has already begun,
the first of June.

72
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,352
Really? Do you have summer in Russia?

73
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,948
Of course. Well, it's Russian summer.

74
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,031
Mm-hm.

75
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,431
And this is my last night in Rome.

76
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,151
Mine too.

77
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,956
You're not on your own, little Russian.

78
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,795
You know for sure this is
the shortest night of the year,

79
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,669
here and in Russia,
so we have to make the most of it.

80
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,874
I'm not...

81
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,270
- I'm not a...
- What?

82
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,228
Come on, you're a woman,
and... and I'm a woman

83
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,914
and we were drinking alone at a bar

84
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,390
and we exchanged looks
and felt attracted to one another.

85
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,278
Isn't that how it works?

86
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,671
It's the first time in my life
I look like this at a woman.

87
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,955
Uh-huh.

88
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,475
Never before a woman
looked at me this way.

89
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,159
(Sighs)

90
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,709
It's not the first time
you look at a woman like this.

91
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,111
- But every woman is different.
- (Metal clinking)

92
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,757
(Clinking)

93
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,551
(Clinking)

94
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,796
(Clinking)

95
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,872
Would you like to see me naked?

96
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,596
Mm-hm, <i>si.</i>
I would love to.

97
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,234
(Car pulls up outside)

98
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,676
- (Car door opens)
- (Low chatter)

99
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,434
Here?

100
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,751
Wherever you like.
Do you prefer inside?

101
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,468
- Yes.
- OK, let's go inside then.

102
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,992
I think it'll work better
if you undress me.

103
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,597
- (Gasps)
- Shh.

104
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,830
(Whispers) It's OK.

105
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,108
Shh. It's OK.

106
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,431
It's OK.

107
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:25,399
We'll stay like this, close
but not touching, while you relax.

108
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,391
Yes?

109
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,388
(Speaks Russian) It's better
if you're asleep.

110
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,198
That way we don't have
to say goodbye.

111
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,556
(Laughs)

112
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,199
(Sighs)

113
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,154
You're right.

114
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,799
I'll say a few words.

115
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,558
Goodbye, Alba.

116
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,033
(Snorts)

117
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,794
I don't want to imagine
what might have happened.

118
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,279
This secret will stay there,
sleeping with you.

119
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,838
Thank you, Alba.

120
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,595
Goodbye.

121
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,076
(Mobile ringing)

122
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,034
(Ringing)

123
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,910
(Ringing)

124
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,830
(Sound off)

125
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,230
(Speaks Spanish) Who changed
my ring tone?

126
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,320
(Sighing)

127
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,836
(Ringing)

128
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,472
(Grunts)

129
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,196
(Sighs)

130
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,150
(Ringing)

131
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,554
What the hell happened?

132
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,156
(Knocking at door)

133
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,153
(Knocking)

134
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,675
- (Speaks English) Who is it?
- 'Natasha.'

135
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,308
(Sighs)

136
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,673
(Speaks Spanish) Natasha, right.

137
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,990
(Sighing)

138
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,914
I think I've left my mobile
in your room.

139
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,152
- Did you hear it ringing?
- Yes, it woke me up, actually.

140
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,992
Sorry.

141
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,674
It must have fallen out of my bag.

142
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,638
I'm very tired
and I want to go to my hotel.

143
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,429
Come in and take it.
It's waiting for you under the bed.

144
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,670
I'd rather not come in again.

145
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,751
Why? What happened?

146
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,912
Nothing. Nothing, actually.
Nothing we have to regret.

147
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,710
- Why did you chew up my panties?
- I didn't chew anything.

148
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,677
See the state you left them in.

149
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,310
(Man singing Italian opera
and wheeling trolley)

150
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,713
(Speaks Italian) Good evening.

151
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,473
Good evening.

152
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,512
How thoughtful, Natasha!
I wasn't expecting this.

153
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,557
Hey, come in
and leave it in the terrace.

154
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,234
Sorry, madam. It's for this room.

155
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,393
But if you want, I can come
afterwards and take your order.

156
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,120
- Feeling hungry?
- No, no.

157
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,114
- You heard. What's your name?
- Max.

158
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,875
Max, we are not hungry right now
but in a couple of hours we will.

159
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,032
You just call me. I'm free all night.

160
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,555
I mean I'm on duty the whole night.

161
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,231
It's there.

162
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,470
Where is your hotel?

163
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,432
- This is Tevere...
- Mm-hm.

164
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,797
...and you get to my hotel

165
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,030
this way.

166
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,074
This is the Rome of the Caesars.

167
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,232
Yes. It's a map to lose yourself.

168
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,472
Where should we lose ourselves?
Choose.

169
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,710
We have, um... the gardens.

170
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,598
Tempio della Fortuna,
Tempio della Ninfa.

171
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,320
My hotel is called "Ninfa".

172
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,153
- And yours?
- Pompeo.

173
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,276
Look, it's this way.

174
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,311
You pass through the gardens,

175
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,517
and... and here we are,
we are on top of the theatre.

176
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:34,357
No, we are... we are inside
of Teatro di Pompeo.

177
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,272
Wow!

178
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,432
- History's looking at us.
- Mm-hm.

179
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,398
We are surrounded.

180
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,551
- Can you feel it?
- How could I not?

181
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,950
- I think you like history.
- Yes.

182
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,031
That's good.

183
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,549
(Gasping)

184
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,231
(Gasping)

185
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,360
(Gasping)

186
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,673
(Gasping)

187
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,311
(Moans)

188
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,116
(Moaning)

189
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,674
(Moans)

190
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,434
(Gasping)

191
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,154
(Groans)

192
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,157
(Panting)

193
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,597
(Gasping)

194
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,870
(Moaning)

195
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,190
- (Moaning)
- (Smooching)

196
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,749
(Gasping and moaning)

197
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,959
(Moaning)

198
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,229
(Moaning)

199
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,556
(Sighing)

200
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,391
(Clock chiming)

201
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,512
- Alba.
- Hm?

202
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,478
This stays here, OK? In this room.

203
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,551
In Rome.

204
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,757
- Within these four walls.
- Mm-hm.

205
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,954
But since we're here,
let's have some fun, no?

206
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,076
All I ask is that
this doesn't affect my life.

207
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:37,588
- And how do you do that?
- By agreeing, the two of us.

208
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,876
You also have a life
outside of all this

209
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,600
that you want to protect, don't you?

210
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,354
Hm.

211
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,153
Very far from yours.

212
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,394
But tomorrow Rome will send each
of us to an opposite end of Europe.

213
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,472
- What if I'm not Russian?
- Come on, you have to be Russian.

214
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,473
- I love that.
- (Snorts)

215
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,871
Well, then I am.

216
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,396
What's great is not knowing
each other's name.

217
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,516
But don't we?

218
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,079
Don't tell me you gave me
your real name.

219
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,271
So your name isn't Natasha?
I knew it.

220
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,351
(Laughs)

221
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,910
Alba is the name
I was going to call my daughter.

222
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,236
What happened to her?

223
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,669
Alba never saw the dawn.

224
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,631
I'm sorry.

225
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,234
That put an end
to the worst time of my life,

226
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,312
when my Alba died inside of me.

227
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,835
My mother took me to Marbella
one summer when I was 16.

228
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,233
She was almost broke

229
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,110
and what little money she had left
she spent on fortune-hunting,

230
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,838
and she was lucky.

231
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,560
An Arab sheik, Hamir Osemin,

232
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,395
he... he bumped into us one day
when we were shopping

233
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,473
and we spent the rest
of the summer in his yacht.

234
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,837
That winter he invited us
to Saudi Arabia.

235
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,235
He has a palace.

236
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,995
Even if I describe it to you,
you could never imagine the luxury.

237
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,037
He bought my mother everything.

238
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,270
So she left there

239
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,116
with bracelets, necklaces and rings
worth a small fortune.

240
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,396
She left?

241
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,433
- What about you?
- I stayed.

242
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,556
Hamir persuaded my mother
to leave me there

243
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,156
in exchange for a monthly allowance
for four years.

244
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,950
That was the deal.
I was all he was interested in.

245
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,236
So you accepted?

246
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,630
You can't imagine
how easy it was for me,

247
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,439
falling into that type of lifestyle.

248
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,272
I had everything I wanted.

249
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,558
Hamir bought me a purebred horse
that only I was allowed to ride.

250
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,597
I began to love him like a child.

251
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,679
Everyone around me was very nice.

252
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,470
Also, Hamir's other wives
treated me like a real princess.

253
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,517
And he got you pregnant?

254
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,830
That was at the end.

255
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,437
Hamir started to get annoyed with me
because I didn't get pregnant.

256
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,388
That was when I wanted to leave.
But I couldn't.

257
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,870
I'd married him so I was
his property, like my horse.

258
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,873
He sold him to punish me.

259
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,079
Hamir got his way, because shortly
afterwards he got me pregnant.

260
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,356
He was over the moon.

261
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,274
He began treating me royally again,
this time like a queen.

262
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,752
Then I realised that
as soon as my child was born...

263
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,948
well, I'd be shut up
with the rest of his harem.

264
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,913
The day the doctor told me
I was expecting a girl,

265
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,356
an Egyptian nurse
who I'd told the story to

266
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,080
helped me escape in a Greek ship.

267
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,234
I arrived in Athens at dawn
so I decided to call her Alba.

268
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,039
How did you lose her?

269
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,954
I'd found out that Hamir
had gone to the authorities.

270
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,079
There was a warrant out for my arrest
in Saudi Arabia.

271
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,754
I knew that if I'd had Alba, he...

272
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,549
he couldn't have rested
until I was caught.

273
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,559
I was only 18 so I got an abortion.

274
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,952
I sold my necklace and managed
to start a new life in Spain.

275
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,954
What about your mother?

276
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,429
I've never seen her again.

277
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,191
And is that how you became a lesbian?

278
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,918
This is how I became a woman.

279
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,913
(Snorts)

280
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,436
What about you?
How did you become a woman?

281
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,712
I don't feel
like talking about my life.

282
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,871
You owe me.

283
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,229
What do I owe to you?

284
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,311
The truth or a lie?

285
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,076
Whatever you prefer.
Why? Do you think I lied to you?

286
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,834
(Door creaks)

287
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,515
It's the Agora in Athens.

288
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,796
Did you know that?

289
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,798
Which came first, the picture
or your story? Who inspired who?

290
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,916
Hm, good question.

291
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,831
This picture has been hanging here
since before you were born.

292
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,754
Long before, and it's been
waiting for me all this time.

293
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,108
Let's make a deal. No stories.

294
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,999
Just tell me where you live,
your area and everything,

295
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,039
so I can get an idea
of your surroundings.

296
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,071
- Hm?
- First go to Moscow.

297
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,516
(Alba) You have
the biggest map in the world.

298
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,229
Now go to the Volga, further east.

299
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,358
Ala! Even further east.

300
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,670
From there towards Ostrov Nekrasov.

301
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,469
- (Chuckles) Where?
- Ostrov Nekrasov.

302
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,313
- Ostrov Nekrasov.
- (Chuckles)

303
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,436
(Alba) You write it, please.

304
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,354
What is that there?

305
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,636
Ostrov means island.

306
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,549
Tell me this is your house
and I'll have to spank your ass.

307
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,435
(Laughs) Wow!

308
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,795
It's as hard as a rock.

309
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,069
Hey, tell me,
what are you doing here in Rome?

310
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,114
Auditioning. I'm an actress.

311
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,430
A Russian film actress.

312
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:06,072
Are you a good one, a very famous
one, or just married to a mafioso?

313
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,118
- I'm single.
- So, you must be a very good one.

314
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,555
Congratulations.

315
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,359
Show me your Arabian palace.

316
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,837
It's not mine. Hm.

317
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,676
Aren't you going to show it to me?

318
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,072
The thing is, if Hamir finds out that
we are sniffing over his house...

319
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,798
- What?
- He's capable of...

320
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,758
- Anything could happen to us.
- (Laughs)

321
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,628
Look, if you don't show it to me,

322
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,315
I'll think you are the one
who owes me a story.

323
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,198
A true one.

324
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,874
I want to know where you live.

325
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,871
Look.

326
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,711
- (Alba) Do you like it?
- (Natasha) Is it a village?

327
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,838
(Alba) No, it's a city.
It's called San Sebasti¨¢n.

328
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,231
- Looks a bit small.
- It depends what you compare it to.

329
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,753
Rome.

330
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,278
I'd say about, um... 20 times smaller.

331
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,513
Ha. Moscow is three times
the size of Rome.

332
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,990
Well, I like it, and you look a lot
like your city. Small, pretty face.

333
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,798
It's not my city.

334
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,873
I'm from Valladollid,
which is like three times bigger.

335
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,756
- (Natasha) Show me your house.
- (Alba) It's here.

336
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,037
- (Alba) They left the chairs out.
- (Natasha) So?

337
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,395
I wasn't expecting this.

338
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,519
- (Natasha) What? A child?
- (Alba) A boy and a girl.

339
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,113
- You have children.
- What? Can't I be a mother?

340
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,596
Of course.

341
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,033
What's up, Alba?

342
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,988
The father of your children
know you like women?

343
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,197
It's not that.
It's the picture. It's...

344
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,517
it's quite old.

345
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,717
Look at the beach.
It's full of people.

346
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,838
- I'm sure we were there.
- (Beach-goers chattering)

347
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,355
(Alba) Or on the island.

348
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,238
We used to love spending Sundays
on the island.

349
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,598
This picture is from the summer
I started living in San Sebasti¨¢n.

350
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,274
Two years ago.

351
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,956
- What's wrong?
- (Sighing)

352
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,796
Alba, is there something
you need to tell me?

353
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,192
(Sighs)

354
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,396
(Speaks Russian) Poor thing.

355
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,713
(Speaks Spanish)
Where did you come from?

356
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,477
How could you just show up like this,
without warning?

357
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,158
(ln Russian) I can't believe
I'm doing this.

358
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,995
(ln Spanish)
What are you doing to me?

359
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,277
You're scaring me, little Russian.

360
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,279
(ln Russian) Is this me?

361
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,317
I can't recognize myself.

362
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,350
(ln Spanish)
Russian sounds so beautiful.

363
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,953
(ln Russian) Only for you.

364
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,915
(ln Spanish)
I'm trembling with fear too.

365
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,317
(Speaks English) I'm going to give you
the best orgasm of your life.

366
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,232
Are you ready?

367
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,628
Yes.

368
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,232
- You know what I'd love?
- Tell me, anything you like.

369
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,869
Do you have a vibrator?

370
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,835
I'll come better
if you put something inside me.

371
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,956
- I don't use vibrators.
- (Gasping)

372
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,270
And you're not going
to need one either.

373
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,000
- (Smooching)
- I know myself.

374
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,759
- What about a little wine bottle?
- Hm.

375
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,913
I don't really fancy the idea of
anything masculine coming between us.

376
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,633
(Smacks lips) It's from "La Toscana".
Sounds very feminine.

377
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,634
Mm, I'm not sticking anything
inside of you, Natasha.

378
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,916
Alba, don't forget I like men.

379
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,196
But you like me as well.

380
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,591
Yes, but I like men more.

381
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,398
You know, I know plenty

382
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,950
who, once they've tried it with a
woman, never want to go back to men.

383
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,669
Well, I won't let that happen to me.

384
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,358
In fact, I prefer the opposite.

385
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,750
So after me
you expect to like men more?

386
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,037
- That would be terrific.
- (Gasps)

387
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,668
It's not very nice
telling me this now.

388
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,395
Oh!

389
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,917
I don't want us to argue,
and even less over a bottle of wine.

390
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,074
An empty one too.

391
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,558
I'm going to order you something.

392
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,834
(Laughs) What are you doing?

393
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,879
Spaniards and Italians,
we understand each other's language.

394
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,634
(Max speaking Italian) 'Good evening.'
(Speaks Spanish) Yes, it is.

395
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,755
(ln Italian) 'Hungry yet? '

396
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,354
(ln Spanish) The lady needs a vibrator.

397
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,631
(ln Italian) 'I'm sorry, we don't have any.

398
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,349
'But I can bring something else.
We have fruit.'

399
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,513
(ln Spanish) That's not good enough.

400
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,318
(ln Italian) 'Something else might work... '

401
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,119
(ln Spanish) No, forget it. Thanks, Max.

402
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,316
You are out of your mind.
You know that?

403
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,277
I did it for you.

404
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,479
What if Max takes it as an invitation
and comes up himself?

405
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:17,509
Well, then you'll be able to choose
between Max or a bottle of wine.

406
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,511
(Chuckling)

407
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,952
Well, Max comes from Maximus.

408
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,953
It is also the diminutive of Maximus.

409
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,350
(Grunts)

410
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,036
(Sighs)

411
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,320
(Moaning and sighing)

412
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,355
(Panting)

413
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,158
(Moaning and sighing)

414
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,875
(Moaning)

415
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,190
- (Knock at door)
- (Gasps)

416
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,238
- Maximo.
- (Bottle clinks)

417
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,039
Max.

418
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,358
(Speaks Spanish) We're fine, Max.
We don't need anything.

419
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,317
(Speaks Italian) I brought
a hot cucumber.

420
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,595
(Spanish) What?

421
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,194
(ltalian) I boiled it for two minutes.

422
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,510
It's sterile.

423
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,678
(Spanish) My friend would rather use
the wine bottle.

424
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,873
It's Tuscan.

425
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,268
(ltalian) What about you?

426
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,193
(Spanish) Me?

427
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,430
I'm a virgin.

428
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,668
(ltalian) Congratulations.

429
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,434
Spain beat Italy. Fair and square.

430
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,115
(Spanish) What's that?
(ltalian) The Eurocup. Soccer.

431
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,633
(Spanish) Soccer bores me.

432
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,358
(ltalian) What about your friend?

433
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,035
Her as well.
She's a Russian tennis player.

434
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,158
(Laughing)

435
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,554
What?
I love Russian tennis players.

436
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,109
(Laughing)

437
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,872
Though I'm starting to wonder.

438
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,355
(ltalian) Check her arm.
(Spanish) What?

439
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,637
(ltalian) One arm should be stronger
than the other.

440
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,553
(Laughing)

441
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,793
(Speaks English) Yes, you are
a tennis player. Look at your right arm!

442
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,713
(Laughs) I'm left-handed!

443
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,998
I mean left, sorry. And you've got
calluses. This is the proof!

444
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,835
- (Knocking and shouting)
- Shh! Shh.

445
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,431
(Speaks Italian)
You two wanna have a trio?

446
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,510
Uh-oh.

447
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,552
Wanna see it first?

448
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,434
(Speaks Italian) No, Max.

449
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,511
It's nice of you to offer, but no.

450
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,875
(Speaks English) You speak Italian?

451
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,393
(Continues in Italian)
It's a beautiful language.

452
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,595
Please, go. Leave us alone.

453
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,676
I got my hopes up.

454
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,033
I thought it's what you wanted.

455
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,031
I'm sorry, it was a misunderstanding.

456
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,156
We shouldn't have called you.

457
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,678
(Singing Italian opera)

458
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,675
Good night.

459
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,718
I was only joking
about the cucumber.

460
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,599
(Continues singing opera)

461
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,749
(Speaks English) Well, thanks to Max,

462
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,038
I've discovered a Russian
tennis player who speaks Italian.

463
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,998
- I like football too.
- You lied to me.

464
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,197
That mansion on the island couldn't
be yours. There is no tennis court.

465
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,833
(Urinating)

466
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,197
So you understood me before?

467
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,920
- When?
- When I spoke to you in Spanish.

468
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,514
Yes, and I was thrilled.

469
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,240
Thrilled?

470
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,834
- To hear that you scare me?
- Yes.

471
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,434
Come here.

472
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,877
I'm beginning to realise
that everything about you scares me.

473
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,316
Your eyes. Your mouth.

474
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,074
Your smile.

475
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,789
The way you speak.
The tone of your voice.

476
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,633
Your smell. Your scent.

477
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,677
Your breath.

478
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,479
Your stunning body.

479
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,676
Your skin.

480
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,400
Your skin is incredible.

481
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,750
I'm more scared
by the colour of yours.

482
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,196
(Alba) Your skin
is like the Russian steppe.

483
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,351
That's very scary.

484
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,997
A question.

485
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,479
Mm-hm?

486
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,191
If I had a twin sister,
identical in every way,

487
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,557
with the same eyes,
same mouth, voice...

488
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,631
And the same skin?

489
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,039
Yes, especially the skin.

490
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,753
- Would you be that scared?
- (Snorts) Do you have a twin sister?

491
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,911
It's just hypothetical.

492
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:44,359
I don't know.
Maybe I would, maybe I wouldn't.

493
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,875
What do you prefer?

494
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,512
I just feel very fortunate that
it's me here, and not my twin sister.

495
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,035
OK, you have to explain me this.

496
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,395
I have a twin sister
with a degree in history of art.

497
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,348
She just finished her thesis
on the Italian Renaissance.

498
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,238
I came here with her.

499
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,277
- What's her name?
- Dasha.

500
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,432
Like you. Because you told me
your name was Natasha.

501
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,637
I don't know your name either.

502
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,431
(Sighs) Now I know
why your Italian is so good.

503
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,876
I also studied history of art.

504
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,510
But in our third year,
we both auditioned for a film

505
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,591
and they chose me.

506
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,149
Since then,
my sister and I drifted apart.

507
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,959
Can you prove it?

508
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,951
Prove?

509
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,512
(Snorts)

510
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,471
(Clicks and whirs)

511
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,430
(Typing)

512
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,390
- What does that say?
- Sasha Ver¨®nina.

513
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:05,680
Sasha? Natasha, Dasha, and now
Sasha? You're triplets or what?

514
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,191
(Alba) So what's with the tennis?

515
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,193
My sister Dasha and I
have played since we were kids.

516
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,033
But she was always better than me.

517
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,191
When do you get to play tennis?

518
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:23,273
You can't have much time between
filming, parties and premieres.

519
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,396
(Chuckles)

520
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,913
(Typing)

521
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,671
(Snorts)

522
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,589
Can you show me your sister?

523
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,233
(Natasha) Dasha is number ten
female tennis player in Russia.

524
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,032
- And she's left-handed like you.
- Yes, I am left-handed too.

525
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,351
There is no reason why twins
should both be left-handed,

526
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,988
even though they're identical
in every other way.

527
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,355
But we are.

528
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,314
Is there not anything different
between you two?

529
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,039
Eh?

530
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,877
I was the first one
to become a woman.

531
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,315
(Sighs) Though not like you.

532
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,471
What do you mean?

533
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,713
My mother died when we were 13.

534
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,794
From that time, my father
started to treat me like a woman.

535
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,110
He used to only touch me.

536
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,675
And your sister?

537
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,149
No, just me.

538
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,551
- Why?
- I don't know.

539
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,998
But I felt like I should keep it
secret from my sister,

540
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,116
until one night...

541
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,077
Dasha saw us.

542
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,038
- How did she react?
- Badly.

543
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,919
She felt rejected and...

544
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,598
that's how
her inferiority complex began.

545
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,072
She got a complex because
your father didn't touch her up?

546
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,708
She should have been grateful.

547
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,394
That didn't last long,
less than a year.

548
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,279
(Sighing)

549
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,519
- Are you crying?
- (Tuts)

550
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,396
You can cry if you want.

551
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,351
The thing is I don't cry.

552
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,796
- You don't?
- Well, I haven't in a long time.

553
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,155
Crying is good for you.

554
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,197
I know.

555
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,279
So cry like an actress.
Come on, please.

556
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,558
- Act for me.
- That's what I am doing.

557
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:32,556
I will love to see you cry. Then
I'll have the chance to comfort you.

558
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,756
(Whispers) Come on.

559
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,354
Cry, cry.

560
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,158
Sorry, Alba. I'm not a good actress.

561
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,193
Ha.

562
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,319
Do I sing well?

563
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,948
(Singing in Spanish)

564
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,634
* Y es que yo s¨®lo tengo rumba pa ti

565
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,588
* Ay, mi rumba, mi rumba es pa ti... *

566
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,990
(Music playing)

567
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,673
(Laughter)

568
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,915
(Singing in Russian)

569
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,155
(Screams)

570
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,356
(Knocking)

571
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,998
(Music off)

572
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,310
Shh.

573
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,114
(Gasps)

574
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,236
(Gasping)

575
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,876
(Gasping)

576
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,955
(Gasping)

577
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:44,271
(Moaning)

578
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,155
(Moaning and gasping)

579
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,994
(Moaning and sighing)

580
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,672
(Sighing)

581
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,558
(Panting)

582
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,552
(Sighing)

583
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,672
(Panting)

584
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,400
I imagine in that Arabian harem,

585
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,154
you had all kinds of relations
with women.

586
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,999
- Or was it forbidden?
- I never lived in Saudi Arabia.

587
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,190
- Shame. I liked that story.
- So did I.

588
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:45,559
It was my mother who fled away
from Saudi Arabia in a Greek ship.

589
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,156
She was pregnant with me,
running away from my father.

590
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:54,269
I'm Hamir's daughter,
and I was born in Athens.

591
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,557
- I'm glad Alba exists.
- Hm, thanks.

592
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,518
So, you are Greek not Spanish?

593
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:06,152
No, few months after I was born
my mother brought me back to Spain.

594
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,436
Did your mother
also become a lesbian?

595
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,875
Hm, come on!

596
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,555
My mother had several men
and several problems,

597
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,234
but she always took care of me
and I took care of her.

598
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,676
And you,
have you ever been with a man?

599
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:25,038
I'm a lesbian from birth,
like you are a twin from birth.

600
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,359
Look, Alba, I... I haven't been
completely honest with you.

601
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:43,033
- I'm getting married next Sunday.
- Who?

602
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,919
- The actress or the tennis player?
- The tennis player.

603
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,116
Dasha?

604
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,319
So you are not the actress,
you are the twin.

605
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,914
My sister's also a twin.

606
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,753
Yeah, but I mean
the... the Renaissance one.

607
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,751
You are the Renaissance one.

608
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,956
Uh-huh.

609
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:10,079
Mm-hm, OK, in...
in one way I prefer it,

610
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,198
but I... I don't like the idea
of you getting married so soon.

611
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:17,114
(Snorts) We've been planning it
for almost a year.

612
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,477
- Who with?
- The tutor supervising my thesis.

613
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,916
- Is he Italian?
- No, he's from Moscow.

614
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:28,278
We've bought a small apartment.
We'll move in after our honeymoon.

615
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,991
- In one of those Russian beehives?
- Yes, very different from my sister.

616
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,515
I'm glad you are middle class.

617
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,274
But especially happy
that your father didn't touch you up.

618
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,318
So, then, you are the one
with the inferiority complex?

619
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,516
I don't get it.

620
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,310
One night I woke up and saw
my sister's bed was empty.

621
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,433
I decided to get up
and go to my father's room.

622
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,509
I remember his huge hands
with long and strong fingers...

623
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:22,919
...caressing Sasha's naked body,
identical to mine.

624
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:29,189
I stayed there hidden for a while,
watching.

625
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,830
It was the first time in my life
I experienced sexual pleasure.

626
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:42,159
Every time I woke up
and my sister wasn't there,

627
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:48,030
I undressed and touched myself.

628
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,796
I understand you, little Russian.

629
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,673
That put an immense distance
between Sasha and me.

630
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,877
But now I like my life
so much more than my sister's.

631
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,076
That's good.

632
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,390
Now you can have your own family.

633
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,991
(Sighs)

634
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,431
(Children scream and shout)

635
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,433
(Speaks Basque) 'Please, hold still.'

636
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,310
'Alba, you said it wrong.'

637
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,191
'Then teach me how to say it! '

638
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,318
'We'll hold still
when you say it right.'

639
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,910
What are they speaking in?

640
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:30,198
Basque. It's a very, very ancient
language. It's quite difficult.

641
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,588
I'm trying to learn it,

642
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,799
but every time I make mistakes,
the kids make fun of me.

643
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,554
I want to have children too.

644
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,436
(Alba) They're Edurne's kids.

645
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,229
- How long have you been with her?
- Two years.

646
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:04,429
She had just separated and I had just
come out of a stormy relationship.

647
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,433
One weekend she passed
through Madrid and we hooked up,

648
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:12,310
and a month later I moved
to San Sebasti¨¢n to live with her.

649
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,594
(Basque) 'Mommy.'

650
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,073
'Give me a kiss.'

651
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,120
(Sobs)

652
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,557
What's wrong?

653
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,154
Come on, Alba, please tell me.

654
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,354
The little boy, he died last winter.

655
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,432
It was in a stupid accident
in the house.

656
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,957
I haven't watched this video
since it happened.

657
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,998
Edurne hasn't... hasn't got over it.

658
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,435
(Sighing)

659
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,836
(Sighing)

660
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:10,032
The boy died with me at home.
We were both alone.

661
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,553
Edurne doesn't blame me,

662
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:17,238
but I wish she could have been there
that afternoon with him

663
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,197
and not me.

664
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:23,035
Who knows? Maybe the accident
wouldn't have happened.

665
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,352
How do you run with these legs?

666
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,869
What a wonderful sense of speed!

667
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,955
I bet you sprint like a gazelle.

668
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,632
How long have you been with him?

669
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,995
- With Vadim?
- Mm-hm.

670
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,230
Four years. Intense years.

671
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:04,520
- And you love him?
- Actually, I do deeply.

672
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:08,150
I learn a lot being with him.
He is very cultured.

673
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,595
And he always knows what to do.

674
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,513
Had you ever been unfaithful to him?

675
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,073
No.

676
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,754
Had you to Edurne?

677
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,631
Me neither.

678
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,874
It hurts us both equally, right?

679
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,158
Mm.

680
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,592
Would you like to give me
a wedding present?

681
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,432
Sure.

682
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,350
(Snorts)

683
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,159
These are the ones left.

684
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,039
I don't know. What do you prefer?

685
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,236
Whatever you choose.

686
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:38,111
And what do I put? From Alba,
the Spanish girl in Rome? Mm?

687
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,989
Well, if you were a man
it might look suspicious.

688
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:47,518
I'll say that while I was in Rome
I met a very sweet Spanish girl.

689
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,638
- And cute.
- Gorgeous.

690
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,756
Vale.

691
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,920
Why are you here in Rome?

692
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:01,993
It's a wedding present
from my sister, a week in Italy,

693
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,515
an attempt to bring us together.

694
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:08,639
But tonight we had a fight
and I went off on my own.

695
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,234
So, I met you thanks to an argument?

696
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,111
- Is your sister a good actress?
- Yes, very good.

697
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:19,272
And she can cry wonderfully.

698
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,476
But it's also true
that her boyfriend is...

699
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,518
Mafioso?

700
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,995
What about you?
What are you doing here?

701
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:34,152
- Here?
- Yes, in Rome.

702
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,152
I'm here for the Alternative
Locomotion Energy Fair.

703
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,833
Future means of transport.

704
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,039
Ecological, clean vehicles
with low energy consumption.

705
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,475
Huh. Nice.

706
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:08,309
- What is it?
- It's called Aspasia.

707
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,516
It's perfect
for getting around in the city.

708
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:14,593
Maximum speed,
70 kilometers per hour. 40 miles.

709
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,115
- It works like a bike. You pedal it.
- Mm.

710
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,157
But if you need help
getting up a slope,

711
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,515
you connect a silent,
compressed air motor,

712
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,398
and if it rains, you don't get wet.

713
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,596
Who invented this thing?

714
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,479
- Me.
- (Laughs)

715
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,675
(Speaks Spanish) What?

716
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,875
What?

717
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,077
- Don't I look like an inventor?
- Actually, no.

718
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,196
I am a mechanical engineer.

719
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,909
- (Laughs)
- Came top in my year.

720
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,830
- It makes sense.
- Why?

721
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,436
Because you are the best woman
I've ever met.

722
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,719
Thanks, love.

723
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,713
- Don't call me love.
- Why?

724
01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:00,271
- Love is something else.
- It is also for me.

725
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,874
That which I'm feeling right now
is very similar to love.

726
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,508
Almost identical.

727
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:09,798
Any love there might be here
right now is pure fantasy.

728
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,035
Like anywhere else.

729
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,398
Now I know what you can
give me as a present.

730
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,959
Hm, it's not in your wedding list.

731
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:33,477
I'm adding it now, and if you don't
get it for me, someone else will.

732
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,518
OK, I'll leave it here.

733
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:39,797
It's in the fair, for whoever
wants to come and pick it up.

734
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,555
- Was it a success?
- Ha, you bet.

735
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,950
I love it.

736
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:50,318
I'm sure it won't be long
before they ban all cars from cities

737
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,516
and introduce your Aspasias.

738
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,638
At the moment,
this is the only prototype.

739
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,189
One is enough for me in Moscow.

740
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:02,516
Be sure that if you get
my Aspasia as a present,

741
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,033
it comes with me inside.

742
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,839
We are inseparable.

743
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,434
Even better.

744
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:15,034
I also know who Aspasia was.

745
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,512
She lived there in that painting.

746
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,515
As soon as I walked into this room
a week ago, I noticed the picture

747
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,194
and I thought that was
a good sign for my Aspasia.

748
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,670
But just today I was told there is...

749
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,400
there is no chance
of it being manufactured.

750
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,357
Hm.

751
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,318
So you went out and got drunk?

752
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,835
The truth is,

753
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,231
since last winter,
after what happened to the boy,

754
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:55,234
there is not one night
I go to bed without drinking.

755
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,356
It helps me sleep.

756
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,195
Except tonight, you woke me up.

757
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,400
I should get going.

758
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,308
Can I have a shower first?

759
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,994
Yeah.

760
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:42,357
(Speaks Russian) I'm sorry, Vadim,
but I can never tell you about this.

761
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,070
Now I have a secret too.

762
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,636
But it's much further away
than yours.

763
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:56,718
(Speaks Spanish) Maybe I missed
the sign in the painting.

764
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,233
It's you, my little Russian.

765
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,356
The good thing I was expecting.

766
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:04,718
(Speaks Russian) You'll always
have that... my reflection.

767
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,273
This...

768
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,393
is mine alone.

769
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,596

802
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:38,599
* Loving strangers

803
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,398
* Loving strangers

804
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,551
* Loving strangers

805
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,711
* Oh

806
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:53,754
* I've got a hole in my pocket

807
01:10:53,920 --> 01:11:00,632
* Where all the money has gone

808
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:11,636
* I've got a whole lot of work
To do with your heart

809
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,998
* 'Cause it's so easy

810
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,276
* Mine's not

811
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,357
* Loving strangers

812
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,239
* Loving strangers

813
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,958
* Loving strangers

814
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,156
* Oh, oh

815
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,470
* Loving strangers

816
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,995
* Loving strangers...

817
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,755
- I want to tell you something.
- Whatever you like.

818
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,789
Tonight before I met you,

819
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,110
my sister told me something at dinner

820
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:49,876
that deep down I imagined
but never had the courage to ask.

821
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:55,034
We had drunk a lot of wine
and we were having a very good time,

822
01:11:55,200 --> 01:12:00,035
until she told me
that Vadim was with her before me.

823
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:06,638
He was also my sister's teacher
but we were in different classes.

824
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,075
When she got the part
we auditioned for

825
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,038
and stopped coming to the university,

826
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:16,796
he called her
and they were together for a while.

827
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,430
It was her who left him.

828
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:26,992
I imagine between them
they decided not to tell me anything,

829
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,594
until tonight my sister let it slip.

830
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:35,038
Don't tell anyone, but I like you
much more than your sister.

831
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,668
(Laughs)

832
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,879
And white suits you much better.

833
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,439
Mm.

834
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,076
The guests are waiting.

835
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:57,638
My sister was thinking of inviting
several friends of her boyfriend.

836
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,279
- Dodgy people.
- Hm.

837
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,034
Actually, that was why we argued.

838
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:06,870
Well done.
We don't want mafiosos here.

839
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,871
If anyone has anything to say,

840
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,669
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

841
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,512
Me.

842
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,909
We are all listening, bride.

843
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:26,954
The weird thing is,
I'm worried about Vadim now.

844
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,396
In case my sister's boyfriend
finds out. He's an animal.

845
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,915
And you? What about you?

846
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,678
Me?

847
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,950
I know Vadim is in love with me.

848
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:43,357
I love the way you are.
You're such a good person.

849
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,114
The best of all of us.

850
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:50,068
And I'm sure you're right,
Vadim loves you.

851
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,117
You above all.

852
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,037
Another strange thing.

853
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:02,193
Vadim has always reminded me
of someone from the Renaissance.

854
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,555
One person in particular.

855
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,915
Who?

856
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:12,278
That guy,
the one speaking over your bed.

857
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:18,478
It's Leon Battista Alberti,
one of my favourite humanists.

858
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,876
He said that
you can't pull the string

859
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,713
without having a dartboard to aim at.

860
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,911
What does that mean?

861
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:34,235
The idea is that the artist must know
at all times what he's representing.

862
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:43,989
The picture shows a symposium
in the Medici Palace.

863
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,909
I'm sure he was talking
about the Greeks.

864
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,991
He was fascinated by them.

865
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,477
That painting speaks of the other.

866
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:59,195
There are 20 centuries
between these two pictures.

867
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,715
In our case, only one room.

868
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,191
We look like we're at a tennis match.

869
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,237
(Laughs)

870
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,756
(Birdsong outside)

871
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,319
(Sighs) Conclusion.

872
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:02,836
Here beneath the city of my birth,
do you love me?

873
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,672
(Snorts)

874
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,957
Well, I don't know why,

875
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,714
but right now...

876
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,714
...yes, I am loving you.

877
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,115
With fantasies or without?

878
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,236
(Birdsong outside)

879
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,754
- With both.
- (Vehicles passing outside)

880
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,798
I look good in white too, don't I?

881
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:37,195
(Natasha) A new day is coming.

882
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,591
(Alba) Dawn is my moment.

883
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:43,228
(Natasha) I'll stay
and watch the dawn with you

884
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,755
and then we say goodbye.

885
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,509
* Loving strangers

886
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:54,035
* Loving strangers

887
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:57,909
* Loving strangers, oh, oh

888
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,548
* Loving strangers

889
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,392
* Loving strangers

890
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,472
* Loving strangers, oh

891
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:15,509
* I've got a hole in my pocket

892
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:22,153
* Where all the money has gone

893
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,870
* Loving strangers

894
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,395
* Loving strangers

895
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,358
* Loving strangers, oh, oh

896
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,117
* Loving strangers

897
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,236
* Loving strangers

898
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,517
* Loving strangers, oh

899
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:49,991
* It's just a start of the winter
and I'm all alone...

(Bell chiming)

903
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,994
I'm going to order breakfast for two.

- (Click and beeping)
- (Chuckles)

905
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,632
- I'll call my sister, then.
- Very well, little Russian.

906
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,550
(Max speaking Italian) 'Can I help you? '
(Speaks Spanish) Yes.

907
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,597
We want to be the first
to have breakfast.

908
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:42,478
(ltalian) 'Glad to hear it.

909
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,915
'What would you like?
Something light, heavy? '

910
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:47,196
(Spanish) As heavy as it gets.

911
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,590
(ltalian) 'You want it to last? '
(Spanish) Yes, please.

912
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,796
(ltalian) 'A nice big breakfast then.'
(Spanish) Thanks, Max.

913
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:55,798
(Speaks Russian) Don't worry.

914
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,349
Can I hear your sister's voice?

915
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,472
(Natasha's sister speaking Russian)
'I hardly slept because of you.

916
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,358
'And I don't like flying
when I'm tired.'

917
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,192
It's like they split
your voice in two.

918

(Russian) 'Who is that? '

919
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:15,034
Room service.

920
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,428
She brought breakfast.

921
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:17,953
'You're having breakfast? '

922
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,634
Yes. I'm hungry.

923
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,552
I'll see you at the hotel after.

924
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:28,313
Are you never going to tell her?

925
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:34,112
So, then, what's the plan?
Pass through here without a trace?

926
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:37,317
Without...
without ever telling anyone?

927
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:40,995
- That's up to each of us.
- Hm.

928
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:45,119
But there has to be something of us,
of both of us,

929
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,191
to remind us of this night.

930
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,430
Like what?

931
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,916

When it blows,
they'll take the photo.

01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:50,229
- (Birdsong)
- You'll see. They owe it to us.

938
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:55,235
(Gasps) What a beautiful thing
you've just said, little Russian.

939
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:58,756
- Your idea was the best of all.
- We make a good team.

Oh, wow. You're inspired.

943
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:11,113

Our breakfast.

951
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,269
(Speaks Spanish) Hi.

952
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,352
(Speaks Italian) Good morning.
(Spanish) It certainly is.

953

We're outside, on the terrace.

There you go.

01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,751
This time it was easy.

957
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:14,276
You wanted two large breakfasts
and here they are.

958

* Libiamo, libiamo ne' lieti calici

964
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,995
* Che la bellezza infiora

965
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:45,109
* E la fuggevol, fuggevol ora

966

(Door closes)

975
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:18,109
Well, now we have a best man.

976
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:21,352
- Couldn't be better.

(Sighs)

978
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,996
I think the daylight
will be good for us.

979
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,310
I'm sure. It usually is.

980
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:50,190
Hey, the sun looks
fantastic on your face.

981
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:54,239
In your eyes. On your lips.

982
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:58,473
Well, look at your skin.
The steppe is turning gold. Scary.

983
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,875
- I'm even more scared.
- Why?

984
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:08,396
Because I know
what I'm seeing and feeling.

985
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:09,913
(Sighs)

986
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,230
(Vehicle sounds horn)

987
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:16,553
Shall we play at being brave?

988
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,952
Hm?

989
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:24,830
If we didn't have partners,
what would we do, you and me?

990
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,629
I don't know. It's all so new to me.

991
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:32,592
- Shall we stay and live in Rome?
- I'm in love with Rome.

992
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:36,150
We'll stay and live in Rome, then.

993
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:40,552
Would you do it?
Would you leave Edurne and her kids?

994
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:43,393
Sorry. Her daughter.

995
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,437
To live with me here in Rome?

996
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:48,674
(Horns sound)

997
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:51,115
This is real, Natasha, not a fantasy.

998
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:55,757
I feel it with absolute clarity.

999
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:00,630
The gates are opening for us.
Can't you hear them?

1000
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,836
Huh?

1001
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,275
Close your eyes.

1002
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:14,636
If our hands meet in the middle of
the table, we enter together, deal?

1003
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,360
Deal.

1004
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:24,679
* Love me just a little bit

1005
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:30,676
* I am about to like you anyway

1006
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,354
* Love me

1007
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,476
* Well, I am 23

1008
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:41,670

1010

(Speaks Spanish) You gave me a shock!

1011
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,318
(Speaks Russian) You're the one
who shocked me!

1012
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,469
(Spanish) What, my love?

1013
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:56,789
(Russian) Electricity.

1014
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:58,839
Electricity.

1015
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,072
This is because we are
very sure about this, no?

1016
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:07,473
I don't know, but right now it's
what I most desire in this world.

1017
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:12,033
(Spanish) Yes.

1018
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,269
(Russian) Yes.

1019
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,954
- Yes?
- Yes.

1020
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,915
(Laughs)

1021
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:30,589
(Speaks English) And how do you
want me to call you? Dasha or Natasha?

1022
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,396
Natasha.

1023
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:34,754
(Speaks Spanish) What?

1024
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:37,229
- Natasha.
- Shh.

1025
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,197
- Sha.
- Sha.

1026
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,191
This is the name I invented for you.

1027
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,998
(Sighs)

1028
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:48,598
* Love me just a little bit

1029
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:52,673
* I am about to like you anyway

1030
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,596
* Love me...

1031
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,672
- And I get to see you run.
- (Laughs)

1032
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,515
I can't wait to go outside and... and
watch you sprint with your long legs.

1033
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,353
- I promise you will.
- Mm.

1034
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,677
Mm-mm.

1035

(Natasha's sister)
'Dasha, what's going on? '

1044
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:55,230
Nothing, I'll get dressed
and come right over.

1045
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:58,437
- 'You're not dressed? '
- No, I'm wearing white.

1046
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,636
'You're ahead of the wedding.'

1047
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:01,869
Yeah, way ahead.

1048
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,110
'I don't understand you, Dasha.'

1049
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:05,633
Good.

1050
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,674
Get into the bath with me, please.

1051
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,188
No.

1052
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:59,909
Just a bath together
in each other's arms.

1053
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,640
Without doing anything.

1054
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:07,271
We will suffer more and it will
make it harder to say goodbye.

1055
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,510
Harder?

1056
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:12,669
Natasha.

1057
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:17,675
Never before in my whole life
have I known a love like this.

1058
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,559
Not this way.

1059
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:23,598
And it can't all be nothing.

1060
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:30,232
Are you sure
you want to part forever?

1061
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,709
Yes.

1062
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,791

1063
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:53,992
(Sighs)

1064
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,516
Don't lower yourself.

1065
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:07,352
Fight!

1066
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,637
(Sighs) That's what I'm doing.

1067
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,631
I'm fighting for you.

1068
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:18,079
Do you think
it's not the same for me?

1069
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:21,836
Let's hold each other.

1070
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,079
No!

1071
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:40,957
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't know what's happening to me.

1072
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:43,395
I'm sorry. You're right.

1073
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,710
I will stay here.

1074
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:47,996
I will stay here. I prefer it.

1075
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,398
(Gasps)

1076
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:55,755
What is it, Alba?

1077
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:58,309
Don't suffer like this! Please!

1078

(Sighing)

1079
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,635
Alba.

1080
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:38,678
You are right.
I understand you perfectly.

1081
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:46,476
Never before I had loved as
intensely as I do tonight with you.

1082
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:49,200
Really?

1083
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:57,111
From now on, we can think that for
once in our lives we experienced it.

1084
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:59,953
The best thing is to leave it here.

1085
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:03,999
Keep it forever between the two of us
so it never fades.

1086
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:07,874
- In the bathtub?
- (Laughs) Sure.

One last turn?

1091
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:37,151
Where?

1092
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:39,754
In our bathtub.

1093
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,275
To leave everything here.

1094
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:44,873
Mm?

1095
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,758
Mm.
