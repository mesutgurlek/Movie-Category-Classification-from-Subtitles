1
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,639
...it's good but
Penn is the place to be.

2
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,477
I like Northwestern.

3
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,149
We shall be arriving
at Altoona in about 15 minutes.

4
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,431
On your right
is Rockview Correctional Institution,

5
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,074
one of the largest prisons
in Pennsylvania.

6
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,396
...today you need
a BA and a Masters degree.

7
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,717
Altoona, Pennsylvania.

8
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,672
Get out your baggage checks
for Altoona.

9
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,508
...the obligation of placing
in his home the Holy Scriptures

10
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,633
and provide him with instructions
in the Christian faith.

11
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,355
As Thomas grows in years,
do you Frankie, as godmother,

12
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,916
and you, William, as godfather,
promise to fulfil these obligations?

13
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,235
Then, by the power vested in me,
I baptise you Thomas.

14
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,637
In the name of the Father, the Son...

15
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,992
Michael! Stop shooting,
you're making the minister crazy.

16
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,031
I'm outta here!

17
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,754
By the power vested in me
by this state,

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,075
I declare you released from custody.

19
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,908
- You're a free man.
- Thank you, Master Lincoln.

20
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,589
Try to stay out at least a year.
Good luck, Johnny.

21
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,076
- Thank you, Mr Rosen.
- You're the best cook here.

22
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,998
I sincerely pray
I'll never see you again.

23
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,828
- I'll miss your omelettes!
- I'll send you the recipe.

24
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,149
New York City can be
a real dangerous, hostile place.

25
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,191
It'll be a nice change.

26
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,391
New beginning for you men,
make the most of it.

27
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,829
Come back and cook for us, Johnny!

28
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,308
Delaney! I'm in, I'm out
I'm out! Out!

29
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,435
Nice thought, Lester!

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,070
Fresh air.

31
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,190
We're really free.

32
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,877
It was a beautiful christening.
Thanks for letting us use your house.

33
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,549
I love babies. Now, I don't have
any grandchildren...

34
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,477
Don't start, Mum.

35
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,876
Would you stop cleaning and sit down?
Come on.

36
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,153
This is the way people live, Frances.
Real people.

37
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,235
- What time's your bus?
- Late.

38
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,078
I want to spend some time with her.

39
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,237
- Now it's my fault!
- Nothing's your fault.

40
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,350
It was a lovely ceremony.

41
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,439
- You wanna try it again?
- One more time.

42
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,517
- No!
- Please! Yes, one more time.

43
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,348
- Great christening, honey.
- Gotta go. Bye, Frankie.

44
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,231
I better get going.

45
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,077
Baby, I worry about you in New York.

46
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,270
I'm fine, Mum.

47
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,433
Maybe I'm not the happiest person
who ever lived...

48
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,516
but that's not your fault.

49
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,115
Welcome to New York, you sinners.

50
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,675
This city is filled with sinners,
we don't need any more,

51
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,235
but you could be saved if
you follow the word of the Lord.

52
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,353
Will you follow? The Lord
can save you. Do you wanna be saved?

53
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,951
Do you? You must choose your way
today, brothers and sisters.

54
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,389
Do you hear me? You must choose...

55
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,910
Leo! Meet me at the corner.
Thank you.

56
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,396
VCR Special

57
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,714
Sale

58
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,671
Cabbie! Taxi!

59
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,116
- What are you doing?
- Helen's sick.

60
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,550
They're sending her home.
I don't know what's the matter.

61
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,237
Do you want water?
Nedda, get me some water, please.

62
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,271
You're going to be OK.

63
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,914
- I'm fine.
- I'll tell you when you're fine.

64
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,428
- What's wrong?
- He's sending me home.

65
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,835
Twice in one week?
Dizzy spells, not good.

66
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,632
It's my medication.

67
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,035
- Nick, I got a cab.
- Good.

68
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,913
Here's $10 for the cab,
you take Helen home.

69
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,554
- What about me?
- You take the bus.

70
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,716
I'll call you this afternoon.

71
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,877
That woman at table five
stiffed me last week.

72
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,515
OK, thanks for telling me.
I'll burn her toast.

73
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,109
I tell her to stop working so hard,
now she tells me that she's fine.

74
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,151
She doesn't look so fine to me.

75
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,479
She's been waiting on me
for ten years.

76
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,034
No wonder she's sick.

77
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,517
What are you talking about?
You know that nice dress...

78
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,437
Not so much butter!

79
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,075
I say this much, why you use
that much? Get off the phone.

80
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,874
In a minute, Tino.
Listen, baby, as soon I...

81
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,038
- Don't tie that thing up all day.
- Luther, who's gonna call you?

82
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,435
Scrambled with sausage, home fries

83
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,040
and a gun
to shoot that bitch on three.

84
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,995
- How was your weekend?
- It was great. I saw my mum...

85
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,917
Where's my bacon?

86
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,350
I'm backed up. Help me
and get lover boy off the phone.

87
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,791
...that underwear I bought you.
- Jorge, hi! Lmmigration!

88
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,355
No, I was just kidding!

89
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,474
OK, here we go.

90
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,071
Good morning, Frankie.

91
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,557
There you go. Sorry it took so long
but Tino's real backed up.

92
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,592
Walt learned to juggle oranges,
he thinks it gives him vitamin C.

93
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,111
Hi, we have two specials today. We
have a feta cheese omelette for 3.95

94
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,594
and a western omelette for 2.95.

95
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,395
- I'll take the pancake special.
- No, there are no special pancakes.

96
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,908
There's the feta and the western.

97
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,748
I'll have the French toast special
with double syrup.

98
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,713
- My goodness! Did you see that?
- Yeah, I saw it.

99
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,830
I'm all right, don't worry.

100
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,795
Look what you did! My father
had to work very hard for this car.

101
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,798
- Get her off!
- Poke him in the eye!

102
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,958
...when you give them change,
they say, "No, I give you 20."

103
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,310
I bring you from Greece
to teach you business.

104
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,397
- I try, Uncle Nick.
- You can sit anywhere.

105
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,635
Go on, take any table. Once again.

106
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,389
No, it says you looking
for a short-order cook.

107
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,637
We're always looking for cooks
but they come and they go.

108
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,150
I'm not a come-and-go guy.
I'll stick with you if you hire me.

109
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,191
I like your hair like that.

110
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,710
- You don't think it's too young?
- No, it's perfect.

111
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,671
- See the guy on two?
- The cop?

112
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,518
Wants chopsticks. Where's my bacon?

113
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,154
My references,
signed by the governor.

114
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,198
- More like a diploma.
- Excuse me.

115
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,470
- Sorry.
- Peter, phone call.

116
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,195
This chopstick has tape on it,
you can't be that cheap.

117
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,630
- The other one is good.
- One chopstick?

118
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,558
You want me to sharpen it
and have him stab the food?

119
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,833
Good idea. So, what do you think,
pookie? You think I should hire him?

120
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,351
- Yes.
- Why?

121
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,518
- I like his face.
- Me, too. You're hired.

122
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,468
Thank you, sir. Really, thank you.

123
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,671
- OK. You wanna know why? Ask me why.
- Why?

124
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,554
I believe in giving men
another chance. Close your ears.

125
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,038
Until he fucks up.
This country gave me another chance.

126
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,277
Close your ears, pookie.
I didn't fuck up.

127
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,754
- This is between us.
- Thank you.

128
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,439
I won't... Could you close your ears?

129
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,795
I won't fuck up.

130
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,753
Here. Fill this out,
you bring back tomorrow, all right?

131
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,274
- You start tomorrow, 6am.
- I can start now.

132
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,835
Tomorrow's good.
I'm Nick, you're Johnny?

133
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,952
- How'd you hurt your hand?
- Soccer. You play soccer?

134
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,833
- No. I play handball, though.
- OK, tomorrow.

135
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,872
Nice you meeting, pookie.
I'll see you at six.

136
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,958
- Got a job today!
- Who gives a shit?

137
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,556
The head is ten points.

138
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,750
How much for the belly button?

139
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,070
Man! Winner! One more.
You know what I'm saying.

140
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,839
Stop playing and get out of here.
Come on.

141
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,555
You took away our playgrounds
now you take away our stiffs.

142
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,116
Guy comes out of the garage,
gets in his car and gets shot.

143
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,955
Hello? How are my shelves?

144
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,555
- I'm a friend of Tim's. I'm Bobby.
- Where's Tim?

145
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,478
He's in his place.
You were out of beer.

146
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,239
- Nice elephant collection.
- Thanks.

147
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,398
He asked me to help
with your shelves. You like 'em?

148
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,510
A little crooked but... yeah.

149
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,279
The shelves aren't crooked.
It's your floor.

150
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,751
There she is! There's the
little godmother. Welcome home.

151
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,791
Have you met Bobby?

152
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,190
We met at a Dr Pepper audition.

153
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,471
He was the big pepper,
I was the little pepper.

154
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,317
Hands on buzzers.

155
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,318
Acrophobia is the fear
of high places,

156
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,828
agoraphobia is the fear
of open spaces,

157
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,156
but what are you afraid of
if you're xenophobic?

158
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,792
Foreigners.

159
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,037
- Foreigners.
- Foreigners or strangers. Correct!

160
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,595
Lucy, this is Bobby.
He'll be taking you for your walk.

161
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,950
She likes to chase Limos.
She has delusions of grandeur.

162
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,595
I know how to walk a dog.
We do have these things in Kentucky.

163
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,790
Kentucky! I'm dating Huck Finn!

164
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,196
- Nice to meet you, Frankie.
- You too, Big Pepper.

165
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,828
So, have I found Shangri-La?

166
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,838
- He's nice.
- That's a rotten thing to say.

167
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,159
He's very nice!
What do you want me to say?

168
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,998
I leave you alone for two seconds...

169
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,510
I know. I said I'd never
fall in love again.

170
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,552
- Where did that get me?
- Don't get dramatic.

171
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,670
It's an occupational hazard.

172
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,790
I love watching TV with you,

173
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,832
I hope we'll best friends
the rest of our lives

174
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,112
but there's a whole world out there,
it's no use pretending there's not

175
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,550
just because our feelings got hurt
or there's some virus.

176
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,591
I know.

177
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,031
But I'm going for a VCR.

178
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,475
A VCR. I hope it comes
with a lot of attachments.

179
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,990
- Is that a life?
- Send out for a pizza, rent a film.

180
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,837
That's dinner and a movie

181
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,271
and I don't have to deal with some
schmuck putting his tongue in my ear.

182
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,599
What is the topic of discussion
when lepidopterists get together?

183
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,232
Butterflies.

184
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,034
- Gems?
- No, ma'am. Butterflies or moths.

185
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,959
You've been to college,
you should know that.

186
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,871
I'm fine.

187
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,991
I'm fine.

188
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,552
Give her a kiss.
Give her a nice kiss.

189
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,231
Want some bran?

190
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,670
May as well just eat rope
and yank it through.

191
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,870
Come on!

192
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,398
You have feet, you have shoes! Run!

193
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,438
Papa! Are you OK?

194
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,358
- What's happening?
- Don't poke! Please.

195
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,588
Hi, are you buying? I'm on sale.
I'll pay you Thursday.

196
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,757
How you doing?

197
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,950
Hi. Looking for company?

198
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,993
- I don't know. What's the rate now?
- $100. Cash.

199
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,271
I appreciate the offer
but that's a little out of my...

200
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,914
Listen, it's slow tonight.
We can talk.

201
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,589
- You wanna talk? OK, let's...
- So, what do you like?

202
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,438
What about the spoon position?

203
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,313
What you gonna do to me
in the spoon position?

204
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,396
Party time.

205
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,432
- Celeste, no...
- Christine.

206
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,717
Yeah, well, clothes on.
You know what I mean?

207
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,634
Clothes on, spoon position.

208
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,830
I will go on with dynamite.

209
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,678
People got to be able to see
as well as hear.

210
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,075
Watch this, I'll do Bette Davis...

211
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,309
You all right, man.
That's like a move, ain't it?

212
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,917
All right! Chop that celery!

213
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,555
- That's a good way to lose a finger.
- Do it, baby.

214
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,797
I had a cousin, he lost two fingers
at his last job.

215
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,638
- He can't even tie his own shoes.
- Come on!

216
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,717
- I wear loafers anyway.
- Frankie, come here.

217
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,679
Look at this guy, he's a hot dog.

218
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,757
He's cute, though.
He's got a cute little ass.

219
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,349
- Why don't you tell him?
- I think I will. Hey, Zorro!

220
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,033
Anybody ever tell you
you got a cute ass?

221
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,469
- Last job I had.
- Are you blushing?

222
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,071
Stop bothering the new guy.
Everybody get to work for a change.

223
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,716
Scrambled with bacon, two easy-overs
with sausage and a Belgian waffle.

224
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,275
I'm Johnny. Who are you?

225
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,790
These eggs aren't runny.
Mr DeLeon likes them runny.

226
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,513
They look runny to me.
They're pretty runny.

227
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,638
- He's a regular.
- Who can argue with that?

228
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,716
And who can argue with you?

229
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,072
"Thy head is full of quarrel
like an egg is full of meat."

230
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,873
Romeo and Juliet. I'm reading it now.

231
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,431
Act three, scene one.
I can't find it now.

232
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,471
OK, raw eggs coming up.

233
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,435
Not raw, runny.

234
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,355
Wait a minute. Stop!

235
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,634
Nick, the pie machine's gone berserk.

236
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,317
Look, if he jumps, he jumps
but they never do.

237
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,079
I gotta go, I'll call you later.
Yeah, bye.

238
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,590
- What do you think of him?
- Who?

239
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,757
- The guy. The new guy.
- He just started, Cora.

240
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,156
I've been checking him out.
Something about him I don't like.

241
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,316
I know what you mean. Some wise guy.

242
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,316
No, it's the headband.

243
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,238
- He is cute.
- You always see something cute.

244
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,192
- I'm lucky like that.
- Is Helen still out?

245
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,037
She'll be back tomorrow.

246
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,356
You know what your problem is?
You're too picky.

247
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,393
Women like that always have
opinions about women like us.

248
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,032
- How do those look?
- Perfect!

249
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,278
You girls take such good care of me.
I know, I should have said ladies!

250
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,156
No, you should have said women.

251
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,033
Frankie, you're looking at
a very old dog.

252
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,470
In my time I've said tootsies,
dolls, gals, chicks, babes,

253
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,637
sometimes even broads -
that's when I was a young man.

254
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,958
When I was a young man,
the wonder-drug was Mercurochrome.

255
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,913
Did I tell you my daughter-in-law
wants me to call her Ms?

256
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,918
I put up with her
because of my grandchildren.

257
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,951
Have I shown you pictures of them?

258
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,879
Want to see them again?
Some of them are out of focus.

259
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,516
Peter, telephone.

260
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,996
How can VCRs be so complicated?

261
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,072
- What's his story?
- Ask Cora.

262
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,430
She after him already? She's fast!

263
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,119
Like a bullet!

264
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,151
Maybe Jorge knows about VCRs.

265
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,760
That boy?
All he got on his mind is pussy.

266
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,389
You open his head,
you'll find little hairy triangles.

267
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,830
Frankie, come here.

268
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,077
The professor from the college just
stuck his hand up my skirt again.

269
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,315
OK. You pour, I'll bump.

270
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,275
- Let me freshen that up for you.
- I always like more.

271
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,311
It's very cold.

272
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,591
I am so sorry! Are you all right?

273
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,631
I'm so sorry.

274
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,551
Helen's in the hospital.

275
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,309
Her neighbour just called.
She thinks this is it.

276
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,432
15 years she works here.
It's a long time.

277
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,152
Do you think she knows we're here?

278
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,351
I don't know.

279
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,951
It's a hospital.

280
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,791
Helen, honey, it's Cora.
Can you hear me?

281
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,150
Excuse me. Could you leave now?
Helen has another visitor.

282
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,191
We're leaving.

283
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,793
We're gonna go now.
We'll be back tomorrow.

284
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,678
Do you think we're gonna
end up like this? Alone.

285
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,111
She's not alone.

286
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,511
She's alone.

287
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,073
Easy. We'll need something under
his head. Let me have your jacket.

288
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,235
Back off, OK? Give him a little room.

289
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,511
- It's not like your father's...
- What's going on?

290
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,835
- Where's Nick?
- At the hospital.

291
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,394
- What's wrong?
- He's having a fit.

292
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,237
Call an ambulance.

293
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,555
- I love...
- What is wrong with you?

294
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,272
That's my girlfriend!

295
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,393
He's just sitting there,
then he falls like a ton of bricks.

296
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,396
Stand back.

297
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,116
We need an ambulance, please. The
Apollo restaurant, 23rd and Ninth.

298
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,879
Is there a doctor here?

299
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,150
Is anybody a doctor here?

300
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,113
- You're dressed like a nurse.
- I'm a dental technician.

301
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,436
- We're gonna need an ambulance.
- They're on the way.

302
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,314
You gotta get him on his side
so he can breathe right.

303
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,351
Where did you learn that?

304
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,710
Campfire Girl...
I don't remember. Is he epileptic?

305
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,313
- Yeah, I think...
- Sure? It could be drugs.

306
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,955
Drugs? He don't look like
an addict to me. What is it?

307
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,797
Epilepsy!

308
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,197
Yeah, he's epileptic.
Go back to your tables, he's fine.

309
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,629
The ambulance is coming. Thank you.

310
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,150
Thanks for cooperating.
Free coffee for everyone.

311
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,192
- Give everyone...
- Nick'll kill you.

312
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,629
You can make that call now, Jorge.

313
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,956
Your name is Frankie, right?

314
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,991
- I'm Johnny.
- I know.

315
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,076
Frankie And Johnny, the song.

316
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,476
Yeah, I've heard of it.
Is he breathing all right?

317
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,637
Yeah. Frankie and Johnny
were sweethearts...

318
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,229
- I don't think he's breathing right.
- He's breathing.

319
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,635
- Why not go out with me tonight?
- What?

320
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,033
I'm asking you out with me tonight,
on a date.

321
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,790
He just asked her out.

322
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,912
- I don't believe this.
- What's not to believe?

323
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,270
No. Keep him company.
I'll wait for the ambulance.

324
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,351
- Welcome to the world.
- What happened?

325
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,313
Nothing much. I just got
turned down by some woman.

326
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,351
You're gonna be fine.

327
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,431
Hey, Lucy.

328
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,072
I'm actually in Rego Park.

329
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,595
Look who's here.

330
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,558
What's he doing here?
He didn't know her.

331
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,876
Sure he did. His first day
was her last... I think.

332
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,514
Helen can use all the mourners
she can get.

333
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,869
- Nedda!
- I didn't mean it unkindly,

334
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,559
I'm just glad
we didn't book St Patrick's.

335
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,115
Tino and Luther were here earlier,
Nick got the flowers.

336
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,435
- They're nice.
- I gotta go.

337
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,075
I'm gonna go with you.
Funerals give me the willies.

338
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,554
- You gonna come?
- We just got here.

339
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,990
- It's the thought.
- I don't wanna leave her alone.

340
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,991
Yeah, sure.

341
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,799
Come on, Nedda, we don't need
a brick wall to fall on us.

342
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,195
Shut up, don't be ridiculous.

343
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,074
You're picking up a guy
in a funeral parlour

344
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,998
in front of a freakin' stiff!

345
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,555
In my wildest dreams
I didn't do anything like that.

346
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,795
Blow it out your ass.

347
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,037
Charming.

348
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,876
Sorry, Helen.

349
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,715
Who do I have to fuck
to get a waffle?

350
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,357
Forget about the waffle.

351
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,512
Thank you, Tino,
Oscar's a lot better.

352
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,917
Hot plates, look out. Here's another
present for you, Luther.

353
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,910
Can I ask you something?

354
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,155
Yeah, shoot.

355
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,398
Tino, give me a moment here.
Thank you.

356
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,357
- I'll clean that later.
- Did you know Helen?

357
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,109
- It looked like you were crying.
- Death is very sad.

358
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,671
But you didn't even know her.

359
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,191
You don't have to know someone to
feel sad for them. It's empathy.

360
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,310
Yeah. Empathy, yeah.

361
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,148
Empathy. The sympathetic vibrations
of two human beings.

362
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,760
- I know what it means.
- No, you don't.

363
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,519
I didn't know either
till I looked it up.

364
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,348
You see, every day when I'm shaving,
I look up a new word.

365
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,398
It's a little piece of turkey,
that's all.

366
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,750
How can you have empathy
with someone you've never met?

367
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:31,113
I didn't have to meet her. I just
looked at her picture and I knew.

368
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,510
I knew she lived alone,
I knew she had these dreams

369
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,870
that weren't quite enough
to keep her heart beating

370
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,469
so she kept it going by
putting a bottle of Four Roses

371
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,114
under her pillow - nobody knew about.

372
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,035
Vodka.

373
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,631
You should get a crystal ball and a
turban, you'd make a lot more money.

374
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,435
I'm no fortune teller.
I just tell it the way I see it.

375
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,395
She had that look. My mother
had that look her whole life.

376
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,112
Disappointed.

377
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,311
I need a blood sausage
and hash browns.

378
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,669
Nedda! She's just asking me out!

379
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,598
I am not! I am not asking you out.

380
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,751
- I'm sorry I'm interrupting.
- You're slicing the turkey too thin!

381
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,270
That's OK, I'll wait.

382
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,838
Baby, you know
how I feel about you, right?

383
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,950
Don't monopolise the phone.

384
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,711
Thank you, Cora.

385
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,030
Did you come?

386
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,356
Yes. I usually
can hold it longer than that.

387
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,510
- Sorry.
- But it didn't seem like you came.

388
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,195
I came. I did. That was terrific.

389
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,956
Are you sure?

390
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,878
Are you kidding? Of course I did.

391
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,993
Yeah, but usually a guy will moan
and yell or something,

392
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,554
you didn't even clear your throat.

393
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,955
I trained myself to do it quietly.

394
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:22,915
- Why?
- Let's just say I've been in places

395
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,670
where full-throated orgasm
would be highly inappropriate.

396
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,508
- You mean like a monastery?
- Yeah, sort of.

397
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,070
I'm dizzy.

398
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,550
Maybe the shoes
was too much for you.

399
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,591
It could have been.

400
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,108
- Or position maybe.
- Position! Yes!

401
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,470
I like that position.
Woman astride. Yes.

402
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,399
Why didn't you say something?
I would have done it.

403
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,796
You did it.
That's what this is, astride.

404
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,512
- What, on top?
- Yeah, on top. Like this.

405
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,075
Though my lips were sealed,

406
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,113
my mind and my body
were just shooting off fireworks.

407
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,434
So, it wasn't exactly perfect.

408
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,711
Don't worry about it.

409
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:36,998
I wasn't exactly 100% - these shoes
are cute but they kill my feet.

410
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,231
Can I stay over?

411
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,711
Why not?

412
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,753
Because if you stay over, the two
of us will lay here all night, awake,

413
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,509
pretending to be asleep but
wondering why we didn't hit it off.

414
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,156
Johnny, you're just lonely.
I'm just lonely.

415
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,874
We don't have to be Romeo and Juliet.

416
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,191
Lonely.

417
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,955
You got a boyfriend, you said.

418
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,392
I got two boyfriends.
I'm looking for one Mr Right.

419
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,356
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- See you at the salt mines.

420
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,470
- Bye.
- Good night.

421
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,157
- It's not the end of the world.
- I know.

422
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,589
I seen the end of the world.

423
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,999
"But look, the morn,
in russet mantle clad

424
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,431
"Walks o'er the dew
of yon high eastward hill."

425
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,836
- The morn?
- What the hell does it mean?

426
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,950
It means the sun is up.

427
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,197
Why doesn't he just say so
instead of this bullshit?

428
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,516
Because he's Shakespeare.
The greatest poet ever.

429
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,754
Are you saying
you don't respect me any more?

430
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,110
- I could care less!
- I don't respect you any more.

431
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,435
I think you're both a pair of tramps.

432
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,677
Look, I did you both a favour,
I tried him out.

433
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,991
Did he really...?

434
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,159
Two minutes tops!

435
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,590
- I hate that!
- And so quiet. Like a mouse.

436
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,518
Marcel Marceau
comes louder than this guy.

437
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,030
Maybe you scared him.
That isn't out of the question.

438
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,913
Well, maybe so
but I don't read poetry.

439
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,077
As I see it, you need two words
to make it in this town -

440
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,111
"fuck" and "you".

441
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,278
- Someone didn't get laid last night.
- I get laid every night.

442
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,276
I bet you do.

443
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,876
- No, not the wig!
- No! I knew not to use the wig.

444
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,993
Do you know those gold pumps I got?
The stilettos? I put 'em on,

445
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,713
things are looking good,
but then I...

446
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,830
I know what you two
are talking about.

447
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,677
- You do?
- Of course I do.

448
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,314
What are we talking about?
Say the word.

449
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,432
- Leave her alone.
- Just one time. Just for me.

450
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,553
- Copulate. Say it.
- Cora, leave her alone.

451
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,273
- Once in your life.
- You are so mean!

452
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,199
You can do it! On the count of three.
One, two, three!

453
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,231
I watch Dr Ruth.

454
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,511
Peter, telephone.

455
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,835
Yeah. How much?

456
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,077
What's with you?

457
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,875
Ladies and gentlemen, staff,
I have an announcement.

458
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,833
- Crazy busboy.
- I sold my first script.

459
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,077
Right! They're flying me
first class to sunny LA

460
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,680
to begin shooting Bloods On The Moon!

461
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,518
I'll give you one last day
and I'm off to Hollywood.

462
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,075
Son of a bitch! Pardon my French.

463
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,910
Nice shot.

464
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,758
OK, serving for the game,
this is it.

465
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,036
I got you now! Go, Joe!

466
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,719
Shit! Pardon my French.

467
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,313
- Out!
- There it is, good game. Good game.

468
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,716
- Good one, Joe.
- I gotta go catch criminals.

469
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,790
Why won't you go to
Peter's going-away party with me?

470
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,833
- I don't want to.
- I'll pick you up at seven.

471
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,555
- Sometimes you're really obnoxious.
- I'm not obnoxious.

472
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,434
I'm just eager to go out with you.
That's a big difference.

473
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,869
545 West 54th Street, right?

474
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,712
- How do you know that?
- Come on, it's on your punchcard.

475
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,878
What are you doing looking at
my punchcard? You stay away from it.

476
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,036
What's your apartment number?

477
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,874
- 6A.
- No, I don't believe you.

478
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,472
6B? 3F? Am I close?

479
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,717
- Am I talking to myself over here?
- Just a minute.

480
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,799
What can I do to make you respond
to me? Can I write little notes?

481
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,910
I don't respond to little notes.

482
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,509
- What about if I give you presents?
- You can afford that?

483
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,269
- I'm saying little.
- I don't like presents and things.

484
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,518
I know, I gonna back off
but I gotta tell you something.

485
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,996
- I got a crush on you.
- Burger Deluxe, pick up.

486
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,511
Why do you want to go out with me?

487
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,358
Because the heart does things
for reasons

488
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,789
that reason cannot understand.

489
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,877
Does Nick know about this?
I'm gonna tell Nick.

490
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,390
You got her jealous, you see?
You got her all riled up.

491
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,398
I want to know why
you want to go out with me.

492
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,955
We're gonna go to the party
and walk in alone?

493
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,389
Our whole life
we spend alone at parties.

494
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,115
So we walk in together,
it's not so bad. So bad?

495
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,000
No, it's not. We can do it.

496
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,555
- What? Do what?
- What's the matter?

497
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,319
I don't even remember
what my order was!

498
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:03,433
One meatloaf platter
and two chef's salads.

499
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,471
See? I never forget an order.

500
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,559
Cancel the tuna melt, the customer
just died of malnutrition.

501
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,319
I'm giving his lawyer
your number, OK?

502
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,436
Try something a little more festive.
You need these?

503
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,957
No, not yet.

504
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,553
I'm too old for this shit.

505
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,477
Come on.

506
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,637
- You look like an Italian widow.
- I wish you'd just come with me.

507
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,559
I can't. I've cancelled this dinner
three times already.

508
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,670
I hate going to parties alone.

509
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,712
I always feel like
everybody's staring at me.

510
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,912
Dressed in that they probably are.
What time is the bullfight?

511
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,110
Let me weave my magic spell.

512
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,069
The land of lost dresses.
And the winner is...!

513
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,192
There. Now that is a party dress.
I feel prettier already.

514
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,835
If you don't want to go
to parties alone, start dating again.

515
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,509
She hasn't had a date in three years.
Not since Phillip...

516
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,711
- I said the "Ph" word.
- It's not true.

517
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,991
What about that Welshman?
I dated him that whole summer.

518
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,031
Please! I don't count him.

519
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,674
What? He asked me to marry him.

520
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,872
That's why I didn't like him.
I knew he wouldn't leave his wife.

521
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,275
What do you know about those things?

522
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,471
- More than you do obviously.
- She doesn't have to date.

523
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,590
I don't date by choice.

524
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,029
Too bad because I love your choices.

525
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,640
We went from Mr Abuse You
to Mr Use You,

526
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,798
plus a fling with a cross dresser
that I blew the whistle on.

527
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,030
Yes! Mama, the pumps. Definitely
the pumps. Bobby, what do you think?

528
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,755
- Leave me out of it.
- I'm giving us six weeks.

529
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,790
Are you expecting someone?

530
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,471
Hello, who is it?

531
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,230
I just got goosebumps.
Do you know that song?

532
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,758
Four weeks.

533
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,271
It says your name but it doesn't
say the apartment number.

534
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,199
- 6A. What?
- It's the new guy at work. The cook.

535
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,595
- Is he cute?
- Yeah, sort of.

536
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,757
Do you have a date with him
or did you order sandwiches?

537
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,872
No, he asked me to go out with him
and I told him no

538
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,390
then he asked me to Peter's party
and I said no, I think.

539
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,476
What did I say?

540
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,115
How should I know? Who cares?
It's a gentleman caller.

541
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,317
What did he do? Run up?
This guy means business.

542
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,351
- Should I get it?
- Wait!

543
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,957
Who are you gonna say you are?

544
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,516
The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance!
What's wrong with you? How do I look?

545
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,996
- I'm supposed to say that!
- Yeah, but you never do.

546
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,594
My God! I look like the Breck girl.

547
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,470
- This is 6A, right?
- 6A.

548
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,715
- Welcome.
- Hello.

549
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,389
- Are you OK?
- My God!

550
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,988
- Can I get you something?
- I'm fine.

551
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,950
I just ran up five flights.

552
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,789
I don't know what got into me,
I just had to run up.

553
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,116
- Wanted to get here.
- You didn't have to do that.

554
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,310
No, it was my pleasure.

555
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,391
- So, you ready?
- Almost.

556
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,998
Yeah? Good.

557
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,600
Nice apartment. Big for a studio.

558
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,436
OK, sit. I guess there's
not an empty chair in the house.

559
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,836
Man, I couldn't figure out
what to wear either.

560
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,439
This is Tim and Bobby,
they're hooking up my VCR.

561
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,277
Right.

562
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,233
I'm Tim, he's Bobby.
I live across the hall

563
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,272
and Bobby lives with
the Von Trapp family.

564
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,750
So, this is your first date?

565
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,675
We just started dating ourselves.

566
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,029
Each other?

567
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,717
That's interesting.
You'd never know it.

568
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,438
This is really nice and homey.
Elephants!

569
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,074
She's collected those
since she was kid.

570
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,192
When the trunks are up,
it means good luck.

571
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,310
But they gotta face the window.

572
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,837
Otherwise it's bad luck.
I read that somewhere.

573
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,269
That explains a lot.

574
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,240
I think I could help you
with that wire.

575
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,876
I think I got it if I could just...
Sure you know what you're doing?

576
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,957
Last time I worked on one of these...

577
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,230
OK, I think
that one goes right there.

578
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,352
- I'm sure.
- No, it goes over here.

579
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,754
You gotta take the plug...

580
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,951
- Are you an electrician?
- No, I'm a cook.

581
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,357
This is so exciting.
I feel like your big sister.

582
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,551
- What do you think?
- He's nice.

583
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,994
That's a rotten thing to say!

584
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,271
He's very nice.
Look, we've both done worse.

585
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,630
Of course, he could be
a mass murderer or a psycho.

586
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,955
Thank you for sharing that with me.

587
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,037
Come on,
hurry up before he changes his mind.

588
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,275
It's better the way I had it.

589
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,311
Yeah, I think you're right.

590
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,955
Maybe I should just learn to leave
well enough alone.

591
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,196
Let me help you. Here. Try this.

592
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,599
I have a cousin who's gay,
by the way.

593
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,800
- Most people do.
- Ready?

594
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,434
- He's a really great guy.
- I'm sure.

595
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,393
He just found out he was gay
a couple of months ago.

596
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,910
I'll look him up in the directory.
Under the new listings.

597
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,394
- Let's go.
- Good one.

598
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,115
Nice meeting you. Nice meeting you,
Bobby. Sorry about the TV.

599
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,913
- Don't worry about.
- Nice meeting you.

600
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,191
- Sure you don't wanna come?
- Next week we'll double.

601
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,351
I hope it works out.

602
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,679
There's lots of reasons. At work, the
little things you do that I watch.

603
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,595
I love the way you swig.

604
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,149
You don't think we'd fit, do you?

605
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:51,070
We fit, Frankie. We fit like...

606
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,636
peas in a pod, like a lock and a key.

607
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,757
I'm not so sure I like
where your key's been.

608
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:10,750
You mean Cora, right?
You think that was something?

609
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,315
Come on, you know what that was.

610
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,040
It's a Band-Aid on loneliness.

611
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,794
So, how old are you?

612
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:36,118
None of your business.
How old are you?

613
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,151
What do you think?

614
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,551
Late forties.

615
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,229
- What? Then don't ask.
- Don't ask!

616
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,271
...but before I go any further,

617
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,630
I'd like to introduce you all
to my heart, Cheryl.

618
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,878
And the man this couldn't have
happened without, Mutzie Calish.

619
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,637
Finally, to all of you
who helped me when I was a nobody,

620
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,671
I'd like to thank you all now

621
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,429
because I'm sure I will forget you
when I'm big and in Hollywood!

622
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,835
I have something to say.

623
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,078
I wish to make salute to Peter.
He worked for me at the Apollo Cafe.

624
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,796
For Peter, my cousins
will play some Greek music.

625
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,356
Let's break some plates!

626
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,516
Would you like some cake?

627
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,755
So, wanna dance?

628
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,752
No. Ask Nedda, that's her thing.

629
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,239
If something happens between us,
I hope you can handle it.

630
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,196
- Nedda?
- What?

631
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,119
- Would you like to go Greek with me?
- Yeah! Hang on, my bra snapped.

632
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,031
For old times' sake.

633
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,157
Me and three of the guys
tightened that up.

634
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,997
Johnny's teaching me
how to be a cook. This is Maria.

635
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,508
- Great party.
- Confession time.

636
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,509
On my first day,
I stole some of your tips.

637
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,753
I know.
But you put it back the next day.

638
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,789
I was broke. I was really broke.

639
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,317
I'm really glad things
are working out for you, you know.

640
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,794
- I wish you all the best.
- Thanks.

641
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,512
See you Johnny.

642
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,950
- Hey, baby. Let's cut a rug.
- Are you bra-less?

643
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,431
Let's go, Nick!

644
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,151
When do we break the plates?

645
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,311
That's good. Go.

646
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,555
Nedda, come on!

647
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:32,275
- It's not Greek but it's good.
- Party!

648
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,154
Let's go, Johnny!

649
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,191
That's right. All right.

650
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,597
Bravo!

651
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,157
- Come on, there must be a reason.
- Dumbo.

652
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,192
- Dumbo? The movie?
- Yeah.

653
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,756
No deep hidden meaning.
Plain Dumbo the elephant.

654
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,156
Just before my father left,
he took me to see Dumbo

655
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,270
and I liked it so I save elephants.

656
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,436
I like that movie Dumbo.

657
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,958
The flower market. My secret place.

658
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,992
Only me and 3,000 florists
know about it.

659
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,319
How about a lovely corsage
for the lady?

660
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,952
Good.

661
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,958
- Which one?
- On the bottom, third one in.

662
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,592
This one?

663
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,631
OK, I got it.

664
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,235
You want me to do it?

665
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,235
You never went to the prom, did you?

666
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,999
No. Did you?

667
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,554
I wish you'd stop looking at me
like that.

668
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,875
Like what?

669
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,911
Like that. It's too intense.

670
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,713
You don't look, you stare.
It makes me nervous.

671
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,593
Thank God! You finally got here.

672
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,154
Sorry I'm late. Get off my back.

673
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,438
I think we should go to your place.

674
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,311
I think so.

675
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,958
I really like you
but does it have to be tonight?

676
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,991
Who says?

677
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,031
- I'm OK.
- Are you OK?

678
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,075
You got something?

679
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,429
- You mean rubbers?
- Yeah.

680
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,988
- Talk about a mood changer.
- Well, do you?

681
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:01,191
The truth is I didn't think this
was going to happen on a first date.

682
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,629
I just didn't think this...

683
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,155
The truth is, it's not going to.

684
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,191
- No.
- It's OK.

685
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,436
I don't know, I just...

686
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,995
If I'd brought something,
what would that look like?

687
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:19,953
It would look like I was planning
to do it with you.

688
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,709
No, it's OK. Maybe this
is just not such a good idea anyway.

689
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,594
Come on. I'm being penalised
for respecting you.

690
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:31,633
You're not being penalised,
you're just not getting laid.

691
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,877
Wait a minute now.
Is this about getting laid?

692
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:41,594
- Let's talk about...
- No. How about I make us a sandwich?

693
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,995
- You want a sandwich?
- A sandwich?

694
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,717
I hate wearing goddamn rubbers,
pardon my French. I know you have to.

695
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,638
I never thought I'd contemplate
sleeping with a man

696
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,638
who said "Pardon my French"
all the time.

697
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,274
Done.
I'll never say those words again.

698
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,517
Where do you pick up
an expression like that?

699
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,917
- This is good. You made this?
- No, my mum.

700
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,190
- Shit.
- Let me see that.

701
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,549
- It's all right.
- I'll get you something.

702
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,878
Just keep pressure on it. Don't
let any blood spill on the meatloaf.

703
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,275
I don't think this is gonna work out.

704
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,356
I can't hear what you're saying.

705
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,154
I'm a BLT-down sort of person,

706
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,829
I think you're looking for
someone a little more

707
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,075
pheasant-under-glass.

708
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:38,799
- What are you doing in there?
- I'm just looking for Band-Aids.

709
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,639
- What are you doing?
- Come on in. Sit down.

710
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,671
I know first aid.

711
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,948
Give me your finger.

712
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,991
Give me your thumb.

713
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,435
I'm 42.

714
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,677
- I'm 32.
- Really? You don't look it.

715
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,838
- I'm 44.
- Honest?

716
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,314
I'm gonna be 46 this year.

717
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,031
What do you want for your birthday?

718
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:35,595
I want to stop bullshitting
about things like my age.

719
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,792
I'll be 35 on the 11th of November.

720
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,876
You're a Scorpio?

721
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,670
Look in the medicine cabinet.
I have some.

722
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,837
I didn't want you
to get the wrong impression.

723
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,353
- They're behind the blue...
- I got 'em.

724
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,870
Is it on?

725
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,955
Not yet. You can't just
put it on until it's...

726
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,791
No, I know.

727
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:19,314
You know, I wouldn't have gotten
the wrong impression.

728
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:36,038
Let me hear you. I wanna hear you.

729
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,876
Come on, baby, let it go. Let it go.

730
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,309
Come on. Let it go. Come on.

731
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,438
I need eggs over-easy
and a roast chicken.

732
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,790
- Here you go.
- You wear bandanna, I wear bandanna.

733
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:04,991
So, the baby's coming soon?
Know what is it yet?

734
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:08,953
- Twin boys.
- Twins you got?!

735
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,434
- Can I touch?
- Yeah, be my guest.

736
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,634
This one just kicked the other one!

737
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,716
Cora, I never see you like this.

738
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,991
People think I'm a tough bitch
but it ain't true.

739
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,508
Shit like this chokes me up.

740
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,234
Frankie, come here, touch the baby.

741
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:32,158
No, that's OK.
My hands are dirty. Next time.

742
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,476
This is your last chance.
I am never getting pregnant again.

743
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:39,195
You said last time!
Flora, the blue, remember?

744
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:42,994
Blue is for the morning.
The red one is for the evening.

745
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,749
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Two eggs over-easy.

746
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,711
Hello to you, too.

747
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,034
I see you made it home all right.

748
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:58,517
Yes, I made it here this morning,
had time enough to put this together.

749
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:01,199
- Nice.
- I slept like a babe.

750
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,840
So, I saw you over there,
you like kids?

751
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,832
- They're OK.
- You look someone who likes kids.

752
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,836
Yeah? So did my father.

753
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:15,111
What does somebody
who likes kids look like?

754
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,793
I need an order
of liver and onions... Captain Ahab.

755
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,398
Thanks for loaning me the car, Nick.

756
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,031
He's lending me his car,
I got an errand to run.

757
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,470
- He's lending you his car?
- He likes my cooking.

758
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,755
How about we talk a walk?
I think we should.

759
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,270
- No. I gotta eat.
- We all gotta eat.

760
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:49,437
We'll eat. How about
I make a little picnic for us?

761
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,471
What's the menu?

762
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:57,269
Whatever you like.
You like tuna fish?

763
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,191
Tino tells me you like tuna.

764
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:03,391
- I'll make a tuna casserole.
- No! Not casserole.

765
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:08,149
- Tuna fish sandwich.
- I am defined by my tuna sandwich.

766
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,430
I take the tuna out of the can

767
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,712
and I work it between my fingers
till it's real soft.

768
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,955
I'm back.

769
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:31,315
It is kinda scary, you got to admit.
Two people coming together is scary.

770
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:33,749
You can't deny that it's happening.

771
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:38,396
I'll tell you how I really feel.
I feel like you're too needy for me.

772
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,318
I just feel like you want
everything that I am.

773
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,157
I do.

774
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,193
Nick tells me guys ask you
out and you keep saying no. Why?

775
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,070
I'm retired from dating.

776
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:54,398
What does that mean? Something
happened when you were a kid?

777
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:57,830
Why is it that any time
a women doesn't want to get involved,

778
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:02,032
men think it's because
they were messed with as a kid?

779
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,116
They were messed with as a woman.

780
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,310
I'm not gonna mess with you.

781
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,999
Do you like my tuna?

782
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,270
Yeah, it's good.

783
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:16,835
You didn't graduate high school,
so what? You can go back.

784
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:21,158
Go back? I don't think so. I had one
highlight in high school, one.

785
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,236
What was that?

786
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:27,273
I played Sister Sarah
in our production of Guys And Dolls.

787
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:29,436
No kidding.

788
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,756
- Frankie and Johnny.
- I've heard the song.

789
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:36,236
- We were a couple before we met.
- Didn't they kill each other?

790
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:39,750
No. She killed him.
You got the edge there.

791
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,153
Come on.

792
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,790
What are you doing tonight?

793
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,912
- It's my bowling night.
- Great! I love bowling.

794
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,316
No. It's a league and besides,
you have your errand.

795
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:14,353
- After my errand.
- No. I need a night to get over you.

796
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,639
OK, I'm on Meadow Brook. 14...

797
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,599
Meadow Brook.

798
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,710
111? What is 111?

799
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:52,478
So, am I close? There it is.

800
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,592
Let's bowl.

801
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,431
Now, concentrate, Cora.

802
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:52,029
Here we go, Frankie.
Need this spare, honey. Go!

803
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,675
Watch this. Watch! Beautiful!

804
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,631
- Hell.
- Great, Nedda.

805
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:11,240
- It was two.
- It was better than last time.

806
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,312
- You see that?
- Where'd you learn to bowl so good?

807
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,828
Altoona, PA.
That's about all I learned.

808
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,556
You're from Altoona?

809
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:36,596
I think I'm going to have
some kind of fit.

810
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,312
I was born in Altoona.

811
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,432
- Very funny.
- No! Are you kidding?

812
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:48,632
I was born in St Stephen's Hospital.
We lived on Martell Street.

813
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:51,353
I suppose you went
to Moody High School?

814
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,868
No, because we left when I was eight.

815
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:57,196
I went to
Park Lane Elementary, though.

816
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,231
Are you really from Altoona?

817
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,748
Why would anyone pretend
to be from Altoona?

818
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:05,634
To keep up this silly coincidence
theory. Don't encourage him.

819
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,956
My mother ran off with a guy
she met at an AA meeting,

820
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,356
my father took us to Baltimore,
to his sister.

821
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,437
- Cora, it's your turn.
- No, this is better. Go on.

822
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:18,836
She couldn't cope with us
so they put us in foster homes.

823
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,357
Now, I'm 18 years old
and I'm with the carnival.

824
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:27,473
This guy, Mr Memory, he's 85
years old, he's got a memory...

825
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,832
Instant recall, he's got things
in his head - entire books,

826
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,792
- palindromes, speeches...
- What's that?

827
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,992
Something you can spell backwards
and forwards the same way.

828
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,837
- Madam.
- Otto.

829
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,075
Boob, b-o-o-b.

830
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,918
- Puppy!
- Close enough.

831
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,633
Anyway, the old guy says to me...

832
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,989
Are we bowling or what?

833
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:55,716
Sorry. Shall we bowl?

834
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,228
That's why he has such a good memory.

835
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:01,477
He can't bowl in those shoes.
What is wrong with him?

836
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,034
I'm gonna use my own little ball.

837
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:28,478
Come on, Frankie, pull another one!

838
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,636
- How you doin'?
- OK.

839
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:53,114
You all right?

840
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:57,199
I know I wasn't supposed to come.
I don't know how you feel about it.

841
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:59,800
- It's OK.
- It's OK?

842
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,831
Really?

843
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,754
Frankie, you're up.

844
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,633
We need a strike.
They're ahead by four.

845
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:13,275
What are you talking about?
Let me look at this.

846
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:17,711
- There, see?
- 92 and eight is 100, not 96.

847
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,035
No, that was a happy face I drew.

848
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,594
If you're gonna doctor a score,
doctor mine.

849
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:28,554
I'm going all over the place
with you.

850
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,955
I don't know
what you're talking about.

851
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,309
I'm in love with you. I love you.

852
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:37,717
I am totally, completely mad for you.
My heart stops every time I see you.

853
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,035
I think we should be married.

854
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:43,038
I definitely want kids.
Four or five if possible.

855
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,640
There, I said it.
It wasn't so difficult.

856
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:49,593
You don't have to say anything,
I just wanted to get it out.

857
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,953
- Talk about a load off.
- Talk about a load off?

858
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,560
Talk about a crock of shit.

859
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:01,639
Don't say that, that's vulgar talk.
You don't talk like that.

860
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,830
Fuck you how I talk.

861
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,314
I'll talk any fucking way
I feel like.

862
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:11,069
This is my fucking bowling night.
Who the fuck are to spoil it

863
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,111
by telling me you love me?

864
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,077
She really likes this guy.

865
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,917
That makes me unloveable?

866
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:21,509
No, it makes you a creep.
No, you're sincere, that's worse.

867
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:25,155
I mean, are you nuts?
Kids, for Christ's sake!

868
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,236
So, what's wrong with kids?

869
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,669
- I hate kids.
- I don't believe that.

870
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:32,712
- OK, I'm too old to have kids.
- No, you're not.

871
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:36,275
I can't have any. Are you happy now?

872
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,314
We'll adopt.

873
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:47,955
You don't just decide
to go falling in love with people.

874
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,275
- Why not?
- They don't like it.

875
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,912
Do you need help?

876
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:56,670
How would you like it if Nedda said
she loved you and wanted your baby?

877
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:01,633
Nedda, I really like you,
you're nice but I love Frankie.

878
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,319
- I'm getting help.
- You don't know me.

879
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,514
I can't do anything,
I slept with the guy.

880
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:12,677
- You slept with him?!
- Frankie didn't tell you?

881
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,950
She said you slept
with everybody else.

882
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,197
- She didn't mention the gold pumps?
- He wore gold pumps?

883
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,231
You just wanna believe that.

884
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,635
It makes it easier for you
to run away.

885
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,750
"You don't know me."

886
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,473
I don't know you? I know you.

887
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,318
What do you want, Frankie?
What do you want?

888
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,476
What do you want from a guy?

889
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:37,398
I want a guy who will love me
no matter what.

890
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,317
You got him. Here. Me.

891
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,920
This is worse than
Looking For Mr Goodbar.

892
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,953
I am trying to improve my life
and I'm running out of time.

893
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,151
Find someone else
who is double-parked like you.

894
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,237
It could happen.
I could meet somebody tomorrow.

895
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:57,636
- Get laid, think I was in love.
- Don't let me stop you.

896
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:01,195
You're not stopping me,
I'm stopping me. I love you.

897
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:05,153
But I'm so scared.
So scared you are gonna retreat back.

898
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,272
You know, that place
you're so comfortable with,

899
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,392
that place where nobody can find you.

900
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,635
That's why I'm coming on so strong.

901
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,591
What's going on here?

902
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:24,038
Frankie, chances like this
don't come along often.

903
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:28,119
You gotta take 'em because
if you don't, they're gone forever.

904
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:32,152
And you may wind up not only -

905
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:35,033
and pardon my French
for the very last time -

906
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:37,548
screwing some other person you meet,

907
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:41,673
thinking you're in love with
this person and marrying them.

908
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:44,188
- It happens.
- OK, you're making her cry.

909
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:46,913
Boy, are you barking up
the wrong tree!

910
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,520
I never thought
I could fall for a woman

911
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,949
who said "barking up the wrong tree".

912
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,878
- Let's go.
- You've driven me to it!

913
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:00,516
All right, let's calm down, shall we?
Wait outside. Are you all right?

914
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,394
I've never used
that expression. Ever!

915
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,237
If I wanted a man in my life,

916
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:09,192
I wouldn't have bought a VCR
I can't even work.

917
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,790
Excuse me...

918
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:52,308
I live in the building
across from you and...

919
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,989
I've seen how he beats you.

920
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,189
Is there anything I can do?

921
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:07,277
I don't know
what you're talking about.

922
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,111
Shit!

923
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,753
Excuse me.
Don't be afraid, let me help.

924
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,791
Thanks, mister.

925
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:28,751
I can't take it any more. You're not
giving up your job because of him.

926
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,519
You were there first.
I'll handle him.

927
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,509
Now, what's the problem?

928
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:39,269
He says he's in love with me.
He wants to marry me.

929
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:42,153
- Bastard!
- He's talking about a family.

930
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:46,079
You can pick 'em. Love, a home,
marriage? Screw that shit.

931
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,714
- Can I answer this?
- Tell him to go to hell.

932
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,310
Frankie just said something
very derogatory about you

933
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,635
but I know at least a dozen women

934
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:00,309
and quite a few men
I can put you in touch with.

935
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,352
Johnny, give it a rest.
She doesn't want to talk.

936
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,470
He wants to know about tonight.

937
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:09,876
Saturday night,
the loneliest night of the week.

938
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:14,158
I'm busy, call me in a few years.

939
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,590
He's singing.

940
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:25,078
I got to go, we're expecting
another call from you any minute.

941
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:33,110
Remember, you're new here
so you're easy to fire.

942
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:37,472
OK, keep things clean. Over here,
we have the ice for the drinks.

943
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,830
Remember that. Here's the telephone,
don't use it.

944
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:46,034
I like your ponytail. You don't
write scripts? All dishes go here.

945
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,277
Over here, all waitresses
put dirty dishes here.

946
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,912
You keep clean.

947
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,951
- You're going to kill me.
- Why?

948
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,471
Many people changing shifts. It makes
me dizzy. It's not my fault, OK?

949
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:05,236
- You had tonight off.
- So did you.

950
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,430
Yeah, well, something came up.

951
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,755
Something came up for me too.

952
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:15,078
Look, I don't wanna hurt
your feelings, OK?

953
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:19,671
I really don't but Nick doesn't like
the help messing around.

954
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:24,271
So please, don't make this difficult,
I really need this job.

955
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:27,198
You think I would
jeopardise your job?

956
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:30,630
I'd quit before I'd do that,
I mean that. And I need this job.

957
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:34,036
OK, let's just both
go about our business.

958
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:40,393
A chicken sand' and
it's birthday time at table eight.

959
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:43,477
This is new cashier
and she's my grandmother.

960
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:47,149
You give her check when you finished.
Come.

961
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,395
Good, have good time.

962
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:58,197
- Happy birthday, Uncle Lou.
- You look great!

963
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:00,231
Lou, blow it out.

964
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:07,716
- Thank you.
- Grilled cheese and skins.

965
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:11,070
I got a little carried away
at the bowling alley.

966
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:16,274
My errand didn't turn out too good,
so I'm sorry, I apologise.

967
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,754
You certainly made an impression.

968
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,551
You want something to drink?

969
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:32,873
I'm on a break too, so...
talk, don't talk, it's up to you.

970
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,634
Are you keeping
some big secret from me?

971
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:59,990
- Like what?
- Like I don't know, you tell me.

972
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,875
- I'm not married.
- Were you?

973
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,911
Yes.

974
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:11,550
- How many times?
- Once. That it?

975
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,591
Were you in jail?

976
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:20,354
- I served 18 months in the slammer.
- What for?

977
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:23,995
Signing somebody else's name
to somebody else's cheque.

978
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:28,795
- A forger?
- I'd call it a failed forger.

979
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,831
I just did it once, I was...

980
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,794
Is that where you
did all your reading?

981
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,637
Yeah, most of it.

982
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:40,274
I got most of my books
from Henry Hank Hill.

983
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,272
- Don't know him.
- Nobody did.

984
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:49,348
He was executed two months ago.
I cooked him his last meal.

985
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,714
- This lettuce is limp.
- I'm sorry, you're right.

986
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:58,910
I'm going to the john.

987
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,554
How about you?
Were you ever married?

988
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,830
No. Chef's salad, chicken salad
and a side of 'slaw.

989
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,189
- Anyone serious?
- Try terminal.

990
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:11,152
Who's this serious person?

991
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:16,235
He got more serious with
who I thought was my best friend.

992
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:21,070
- Really? How long ago was that?
- Three years.

993
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:28,238
I was divorced three years ago.
Now, is that a coincidence?

994
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:31,397
- Really?
- I cross my heart and hope to die.

995
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,352
- Waitress!
- I'll be right with you, ma'am.

996
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,630
- You got any kids?
- Two.

997
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,750
I thought so. You see 'em?

998
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,837
- Yesterday. First time in two years.
- Yeah?

999
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,916
That's what the errand was.

1000
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,758
My wife remarried,
she lives in the suburbs.

1001
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:55,270
- I hate the suburbs.
- It's not bad. Beautiful house.

1002
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:59,438
Nice. I could never have provided
them with anything like that.

1003
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:02,916
I got there, there were my kids,
playing on the lawn.

1004
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:05,155
I bet they were glad to see you.

1005
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:13,149
I didn't get out of the car,
you know. I just couldn't...

1006
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:23,470
They looked so happy and all.
They got so big.

1007
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,268
Looked like somebody else's kids.

1008
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:31,231
I just drove away.

1009
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:38,836
It's like I lost them, you know?
That's how I feel.

1010
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:42,634
- Waitress!
- Hello? Can we get some service?

1011
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:46,070
You haven't lost them,
you're just not ready.

1012
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:52,871
Finally! What's safe to eat here?

1013
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:55,388
I'm sorry, we're closed.

1014
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:58,631
What kind of a place is this?

1015
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,670
Hurry up, let's go.

1016
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:09,474
- Night, Frankie.
- Night, Andreas.

1017
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:12,114
Here's yours, Frankie.

1018
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:15,550
- You come back any Saturday night.
- Thanks, Maxine.

1019
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,591
- Night, Maxine.
- Night.

1020
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:21,712
Was she home? Did you talk to her?

1021
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:25,196
- What she say?
- I'm seeing the kids next weekend.

1022
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:29,151
- Good.
- Thank you.

1023
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:34,431
What is that?

1024
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:37,471
It's a rose.

1025
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,471
Grew in the kitchen.

1026
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,311
Good night, closing up.

1027
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:50,353
Everything finished. It's good.

1028
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,197
What's that?

1029
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:56,038
- It's potato.
- It's a rose.

1030
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,514
- Johnny made it.
- On my break.

1031
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:01,391
It's nice.

1032
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,829
Red potato, it's very romantic.

1033
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,431
Frankie, you want lift home?

1034
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,516
It's OK. Thanks.

1035
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,276
OK, you know how to close up.
Bring back fork.

1036
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,155
- Good night.
- Night, Nick.

1037
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:27,351
Come on, Grandma,
we go home and watch wrestling.

1038
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:32,758
Come on, I'll walk you home.

1039
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:37,438
So, how about you? Do you ever
want to kill yourself sometimes?

1040
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:41,797
Yeah, everybody wants
to kill themself sometime.

1041
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,115
Can we change the subject?

1042
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,549
- You want me to buy you that?
- Yeah.

1043
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:55,717
If you had any wish,
what you wish to be?

1044
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:58,069
You won't laugh?

1045
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:02,033
- Teacher. Teaching little kids.
- That's good.

1046
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:05,436
What about you?
Did you always dream of being a cook?

1047
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:08,278
No, prison did it.

1048
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:12,711
When I went in and I heard
that "clank", you know, I died.

1049
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:17,714
Then they put me in the kitchen
with food and, I don't know,

1050
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,796
suddenly I was born again.

1051
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:24,038
I started to feel
like I could breathe again.

1052
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:27,356
You know,
it was like I had aspirations.

1053
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:30,597
Aspiration?
Have you been shaving again?

1054
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,950
So what about this
terminal relationship you had?

1055
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,959
What was it? A guy who left you
for your best friend?

1056
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,834
Phillip? You know what
the main thing I felt was? Dumb.

1057
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:47,759
I even introduced them.
I lent them money.

1058
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,791
I gave her my old television.

1059
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:53,559
They're probably watching it
right now.

1060
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,558
I hope it explodes and blows
their faces off.

1061
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:02,155
What about before Phillip?
Anybody else?

1062
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,919
I don't wanna talk about that.

1063
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:18,920
OK, but you can't spend the night.

1064
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,679
There's gotta be
something in this world

1065
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:30,077
better than watching you do that
but I'm damned if I know what it is.

1066
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:31,712
Yeah, sure.

1067
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,912
No, I'd put it up there.
It's a vision, inspired spectacle.

1068
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:39,316
I'd put it up there with
the Grand Canyon,

1069
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,909
mother nursing her child,
triumphant facts of nature.

1070
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:46,669
- You been to the Grand Canyon?
- I have not, no.

1071
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:50,474
Me either. I'd like to go there
some day. Hawaii, too.

1072
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:55,711
Open your robe.

1073
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,795
No, I don't wanna open my robe.

1074
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,837
Why?

1075
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,348
I don't know,
I just wanna look at you.

1076
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,196
15 seconds, that's all.

1077
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:17,597
- I just wanna look at it.
- Look at what? Why?

1078
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:22,829
I don't know, I just...
To know that I can.

1079
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:25,917
That I can look at the woman I love
and just see her.

1080
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:29,350
Her eyes, her breasts,
her stomach, her...

1081
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:32,631
- Don't say it! I hate that word.
- I wasn't going to.

1082
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:35,148
I hate both of them!

1083
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:38,317
I'll look up some new ones
in my thesaurus.

1084
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:45,556
I never know when you're
playing games or being serious.

1085
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,990
It's both. Serious games.
Why do we have to name everything?

1086
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:53,556
Say you had a pet parakeet. If it was
beautiful, I'd want to look at it.

1087
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,717
You'd let me look at it
and we'd move on.

1088
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:00,150
I had a parakeet, I hated it.
I was glad when it died.

1089
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:18,958
15 seconds. I'm timing this.
Turn that light out.

1090
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:47,272
I told my cousin I didn't want a
bird. She swore I'd love a parakeet.

1091
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,788
What's to love?
They don't do anything

1092
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:53,469
except not sing when you want them to
and sing when you don't

1093
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,909
and make that awful scratching noise.

1094
01:32:55,960 --> 01:33:00,397
If I ever get another pet,
it'll be a dog.

1095
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,470
Something you can hold.

1096
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:08,308
The only time I got my hands on
that parakeet was the day it died

1097
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:12,148
and I had to pick it up
and throw it away. That's enough.

1098
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:15,397
That's got to be 15 seconds.
Happy now?

1099
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:29,510
That music is nice.

1100
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:35,751
It makes me think of grace.

1101
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:39,430
This is Midnight With Marlon.

1102
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:43,109
For information on becoming
a member of the WNYL family,

1103
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:46,709
why not give me a call? 555-1111.

1104
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:52,475
Why do you want to kill
yourself sometimes?

1105
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:56,718
I want to kill myself when I think
I'm the only person in the world

1106
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:01,834
and that part of me that feels
that way is trapped inside this body

1107
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:04,110
that only bumps into other bodies

1108
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:09,109
without connecting to another person
in the world trapped inside of them.

1109
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:13,550
We have to connect.

1110
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,551
We just have to.

1111
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:22,470
I feel... very...

1112
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:24,431
Say it.

1113
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:27,835
- I don't know what.
- Say it anyway.

1114
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:30,952
- Protective.
- Good. That's very nice.

1115
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,754
I'm looking for somebody
to take care of me this time.

1116
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,836
Aren't we all?

1117
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:42,599
Why do we keep going from one subject
I don't like to another?

1118
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,959
What is this?
Suddenly the armour's up?

1119
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,718
What about your armour?

1120
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:53,390
Besides, I wasn't talking about you.
Not everyone thinks life is a picnic.

1121
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:58,398
Some of us have problems.
Some of us have sorrows.

1122
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:01,432
People like you
are so busy telling us what you want

1123
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:03,471
you don't notice the rest of us

1124
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,353
who aren't exactly singing
Yankee Doodle Dandy.

1125
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:09,278
Hold it, how we getting
into this now?

1126
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:11,470
I've done nothing but notice you.

1127
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,397
You don't, you smother me.

1128
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:16,955
I'm not giving up everything
for someone I don't know.

1129
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,230
I can't repeat the same stupidity.

1130
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:23,239
Who says you have to give up
anything? We're talking about love.

1131
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:26,192
- We're not in love.
- That's what you think.

1132
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:30,074
I think we are. Just because
you've given up on that possibility

1133
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:32,873
there's no need to drag me down
to that level.

1134
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:36,553
I think you better leave now.

1135
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:40,275
You know, I'm sorry.
I thought you were a kindred spirit.

1136
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:44,630
Kindred means two of a kind
sharing a great affinity.

1137
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:48,878
- I know what kindred means.
- Shall we go for affinity?

1138
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:55,995
You know, that is the first really
rotten thing you've said to me.

1139
01:35:56,040 --> 01:36:02,479
To make fun of somebody else's
intelligence or education or lack of,

1140
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:05,318
that is somebody
I'd be very glad not to know.

1141
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:07,396
I thought you were sad, weird.

1142
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:10,113
- I didn't know you were cruel.
- I'm sorry.

1143
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:14,517
It's just a cruelty waiting
to happen again. I want you to go.

1144
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,915
Why do you want me to go? Really.

1145
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,679
I want to be alone,
I want to watch my VCR,

1146
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:21,915
eat ice cream, I want to go to sleep.

1147
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:27,557
Come on, alone? Sooner or later
you're gonna have to deal with us.

1148
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:29,830
There's just no two ways about it.

1149
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:34,235
So why don't we just get it
over with? You're in the mood.

1150
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:38,034
Tomorrow's Sunday, day off.
We'll sleep in. Let's talk.

1151
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:40,071
- Right, I'm calling Tim.
- Tim?

1152
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:42,634
No, Bobby.
He'll beat the shit out of you.

1153
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:45,877
- Not yet.
- I'll open that window and scream.

1154
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:49,959
In this city? Everybody's doing
the same thing, who'll hear you?

1155
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:53,515
Get out!

1156
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:04,072
I promise I will go
only I wanna make a call.

1157
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:14,238
You know, this all should be so easy.
Why is it always so damn hard?

1158
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:23,559
Hello? Midnight With Marlon?
Hello, Marlon. My name is Johnny

1159
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:28,720
and I would like to know the name
of that piece of piano music

1160
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,751
you were playing a minute ago

1161
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:33,314
so I can buy the record
for my lady love,

1162
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:37,478
whose name is Frankie, is that
a coincidence? Frankie and Johnny.

1163
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:43,716
Debussy, Claude Debussy, right.
Clair de Lune, you got that?

1164
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:46,950
Why are you doing this?

1165
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,673
Everything I want is in this room.

1166
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:56,631
Hello, Marlon?

1167
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:02,157
I know you don't take requests
but could you just listen to me?

1168
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:05,237
Now, there's a man and a woman.

1169
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,748
He's a cook, she's a waitress.

1170
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:11,833
Now, they meet
and they don't connect,

1171
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:17,432
only she noticed him,
he could feel it, and he noticed her

1172
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:20,199
and they both knew
it was gonna happen.

1173
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:25,155
They made love
and for maybe one whole night,

1174
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:27,430
they forgot the 10 million things

1175
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:31,109
that make people think
"I don't love this person,

1176
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:34,152
"I don't like this person,
I don't know this..."

1177
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:37,749
Instead, it was perfect
and they were perfect

1178
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,473
and that's all there was
to know about it.

1179
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:43,318
Only now, she's beginning
to forget all that

1180
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,430
and maybe he'll forget it, too.

1181
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:48,517
So could you play an encore
for Frankie and Johnny

1182
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:53,350
in the hope of something that ought
to last and not self-destruct?

1183
01:38:57,160 --> 01:39:00,914
Why don't you just
think about it? Thank you.

1184
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:12,069
I want to show you something.

1185
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,788
That guy I didn't want to talk about,

1186
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:31,400
he did this with a belt buckle.

1187
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:42,951
It's gone.

1188
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,436
It'll never go.

1189
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:49,313
It's gone. I made it go.

1190
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:52,909
No, Johnny, you can't make it
go away. Nobody can.

1191
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:58,870
He's the reason I can't have...

1192
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:03,271
kids.

1193
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,275
He knocked me around

1194
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:19,194
when I was pregnant and...

1195
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,829
I lost the baby.

1196
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,789
There were complications.

1197
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:37,871
He's gone now.

1198
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:42,517
I would never hit you. Never.

1199
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:47,509
You don't have to be afraid any more.

1200
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:49,676
I am. I'm afraid.

1201
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:55,274
I'm afraid to be alone,
I'm afraid not to be alone.

1202
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:59,233
I'm afraid of what I am,
what I'm not,

1203
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:02,477
what I might become,
what I might never become.

1204
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,790
I don't wanna stay at my job
for the rest of my life but I...

1205
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:17,720
I'm afraid to leave.

1206
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:22,709
And I'm just tired, you know,
I'm just so tired of being afraid.

1207
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:32,030
Honey, listen.

1208
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:39,674
I know I can't make the bad go away.
You're right, I can't.

1209
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:45,035
But when the bad comes again...

1210
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:49,155
I'm gonna be next to you.

1211
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:55,951
I can't, Johnny.

1212
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,797
I'm sorry.

1213
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:36,917
This is WNYL in New York

1214
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:40,157
and you're listening to
Midnight With Marlon.

1215
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:43,476
As you know, it's not my policy
to take requests

1216
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:46,592
but there's always
an exception to the rule.

1217
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:51,760
I don't know if this is the most
beautiful song, Frankie and Johnny.

1218
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:54,189
I wish they
really were your names

1219
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:56,879
but I know when
my leg's being pulled.

1220
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:00,559
God, how I wish you two
really existed.

1221
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:04,195
Maybe I'm crazy, but I'd still
like to believe in love.

1222
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:06,231
Why the hell do you think
I work these hours?

1223
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:14,756
Anyway, you two moonbeams,
whoever, wherever you are,

1224
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,916
whatever you're doing,

1225
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:19,269
this one's for you.

1226
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:21,470
Here's an encore.

1227
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:43,155
You wanna brush?

1228
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:48,395
That means you want me to brush?

1229
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:54,879
Take the blue one,
it's never been used.

1230
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,835
I'm not gonna ask whose robe this is.

1231
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:10,671
Good.

1232
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:22,837
You should get toothpaste
with fluoride.

1233
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:24,871
Listen.

1234
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:35,591
No matter what?

1235
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:51,156
I'm 36.
