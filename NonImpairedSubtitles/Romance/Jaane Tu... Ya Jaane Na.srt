1
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:32,432
Sorry.

2
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,907
This is a very special
song for our group.

3
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:38,673
True. That's why you people are
singing it with full strength.

4
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,615
- What lies? We started it for church.
- Right.

5
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:49,689
Sings in the local trains like
this, "you know or don't know".

6
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,281
She is so funny. Isn't it?

7
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:54,988
Hi mons...

8
00:04:56,396 --> 00:05:00,733
- <your love with me>
- no... no... no...

9
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,803
- <stays like same>
- no... no... no...

10
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:10,367
<or sings like same,
you know, or don't know>

11
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,743
where are you going?

12
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,243
- Very sad.
- Hi mala.

13
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:33,364
- Jagi my piggy.
- Yes shaali my kaali.

14
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:38,004
- What's the matter?
- When your flight will take off?

15
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,506
- Means?
- When you'll tell mala?

16
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,939
- What?
- You know...

17
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,835
come... come... i'm your love...

18
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,783
50 times i asked her for
friendship then i came for a date.

19
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:54,887
- If i'll say l word then i'll get gpl.
- Jignesh...

20
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:59,415
you are a stud. You bring
airhostess on a date at airport.

21
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,720
- You.
- Let's go.

22
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,287
There they are...

23
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,235
why are you standing outside? Go inside.

24
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,371
- In ac.
- Entry is banned.

25
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,431
- Banned, why?
- Some matter of bomb.

26
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:18,741
Means, have to stand over here
in heat. I don't believe this.

27
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:24,480
Let's go mala, our group is very
fun loving. We'll enjoy a lot.

28
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:29,422
Tell me one thing didi, what i'm
doing at airport on my off day?

29
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,291
Oh sorry mala! It's like this our special
friends are coming back today and you know...

30
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,461
- then have to brought flowers and sweets...
- that i haven't brought.

31
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:40,694
Why you bring me? I don't know them
and i came like an idiot to receive them.

32
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,363
I hate airports.

33
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,500
I love airports.

34
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:53,646
After a long time when people meet
so every meeting has a new story.

35
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:57,383
I know stories but i
hate stories too much.

36
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:00,250
Specially those stories
which ends on airports.

37
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,723
Why? Is it a joke to get
inside, stop the plane? Try to

38
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:07,226
shout them down with bullet
by considering as terrorist.

39
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:10,855
- Aren't you too much romantic?
- No. I hate romance.

40
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:15,256
I mean, seriously guys. Sad
couples all around, before marriage

41
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:19,572
they doubt and fight and just
after marriage, 'we are bored'.

42
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:20,504
Not at all.

43
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,642
- If he find the right person.
- Made for each other, bullshit.

44
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,313
It happens in dreams not in real life.

45
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,837
It happens, swear.

46
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,719
Tell me where it happens?
I'm curious tell me.

47
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:37,951
For that have to hear a story
and you don't like stories.

48
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,382
What kind of story? Love story.

49
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:45,596
- In which heroes, heroines an villains.
- Villains are a bit less.

50
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:50,837
- But fights, songs and misunderstandings.
- Err full on!

51
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,406
- And climax at airport.
- Absolutely right.

52
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:58,708
- Sounds horrible, no thank you.
- Listen, by the way flight is late.

53
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,483
- I'll feel bore then i'll tell you clearly.
- Okay.

54
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,848
- Okay.
- Okay.

55
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,520
- Have to.
- Mala, it's like...

56
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,318
once upon a time girl and a boy...

57
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,750
story starts from a dream.

58
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:22,426
In dream a man having sword in his hand in
full drama costume is ridding a horse.

59
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,880
Hold it... hold it... hold it.

60
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,282
- Is this your dream.
- No.

61
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:39,418
- Then how you know?
- Because jai saw those kind of dreams.

62
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,255
- And who is jai?
- That, who is watching this dream now listen.

63
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:42,846
Listen.

64
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:19,721
Hello.

65
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:24,454
I just be back.

66
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,208
- Jai.
- Emergency mom.

67
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,268
- But your exams.
- Its aditi.

68
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,839
She needs me.

69
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:18,341
I'm sorry, we tried completely
but we aren't able to save her.

70
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,280
I want to say something.

71
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,616
Radha isn't among us today.

72
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:04,354
I remember that day till today,
when we saw her first time.

73
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:11,869
Big black eyes, innocence on
face but too much mischievous.

74
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:22,874
She stayed with for a while, touched our
life. We'll never forget radha, aditi.

75
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:25,242
Come.

76
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:31,757
Together we pray, wherever
radha go, stay happy,

77
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:36,751
remember us and at least
learn to catch the rats.

78
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,334
- Was radha a cat?
- Yes.

79
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,704
- Cat's funeral.
- Yes.

80
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,305
Even her funeral was done properly.

81
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,274
- Are you all mad?
- We all aren't, aditi.

82
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:53,579
She picked radha from college and
since then she was like her daughter.

83
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,377
Everything is on extreme for aditi.

84
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,318
Love, hate, attachment.

85
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,387
She hadn't do anything by weighing.

86
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,723
But how come you guys
took all this seriously?

87
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,352
No... no... actually
we also felt it silly...

88
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,360
...but not jai.

89
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,365
Jai only knew one thing.

90
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,228
Aditi was depressed.

91
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,204
Only aditi's smile was necessary for him.

92
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,291
- Did you like aditi too much?
- Yes too much.

93
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:14,769
And booms like jai but if jai could
see anything except aditi then.

94
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,871
- Mom.
- Yeah.

95
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:25,869
I'm over here.

96
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,407
Pumi aunty.

97
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:31,406
Thanks.

98
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,708
Yes pumi speak.

99
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:35,853
What?

100
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,187
Again.

101
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:42,222
This is the limit. That son of bitch.

102
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,397
No... no... no... it's useless.

103
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,667
Police complaints are enough.
Okay if you want to write

104
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:52,262
letter to police commissioner.
I'm going to talk to newspaper.

105
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:56,406
Yeah... yeah... till the time we haven't
suspend him he'll not learn the lesson.

106
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,238
Yes... yes, i'll see you in the office.

107
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:04,416
- This is the limit.
- Your old friend inspector vagmari.

108
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,420
Who else would be? He bang a 14
years old boy in police lockup.

109
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,657
Can you believe it? That man...

110
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:14,182
- he needs his own bamboo.
- Mom... mom... mom... mom.

111
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:20,222
Calm... take the breath
inside and release it slowly.

112
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,830
- Really.
- What do you wana have in breakfast?

113
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,230
- Is it your turn?
- Yes.

114
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,665
Your turn but it's my mood.

115
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,371
- Mom.
- Yes.

116
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,843
Yesterday night, again
i dreamt that dream.

117
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,353
Which dream?

118
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:45,414
Same, that somebody is having a
sword in hand and ridding a horse.

119
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,692
You haven't put pepper on it.

120
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,560
I'm not sure but i felt it before...

121
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,257
i think he's dad.

122
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,263
Dad... your dad.

123
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,776
- My husband.
- I think so.

124
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:09,304
Ridding a horse and
sword in hand. Oh come on!

125
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,247
How could you?

126
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,685
How could you think such like that jai?

127
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:18,322
- I just...
- you know that how much he hates uproar.

128
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,193
It's far for him to fight but he
can't even see somebody fighting.

129
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,222
He lost his life in it.

130
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:32,334
He went to stop somebody's
fight and never came back.

131
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:41,339
Mom... mom... mom... i'm sorry.

132
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,880
It's dream what can i do?

133
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:54,258
This is depressing jai that you
are dreaming that kind of dreams.

134
00:19:55,327 --> 00:20:01,300
Jai singh rathore aka rats was
world's most non-violent person.

135
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:06,338
Seriously if ghandi-ji is alive
then he must cry after seeing jai.

136
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,307
And he suffers from
acidity after seeing aditi.

137
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:15,247
Fatu you, your mother... your father...
your whole family, son of swine's.

138
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,348
What the hell is going on?

139
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,917
Jai, i'm going to give him a lesson.

140
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:22,888
- Come dog i'll show you.
- Aditi are you mad?

141
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,880
- You called aditi fatu.
- Not her, you.

142
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,289
Me.

143
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,629
- What's the problem?
- Lets go from here.

144
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,298
- Vivak it's enough now.
- Keep your cat collared...

145
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,334
...otherwise she'll come
under my car, understand?

146
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,970
From same place your mom picked you up.

147
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,633
Jai if she isn't stop shouting
then i'll bang you out.

148
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,373
Is jai afraid of you?

149
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,339
- Yeah.
- Isn't it?

150
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,048
Go jai and bang his face.

151
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:53,352
- Who? Me.
- Come swine... come.

152
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,388
Nileash leave my hand
otherwise i'll bang your face.

153
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,880
Leave... leave... leave...

154
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:06,260
aditi what are you doing? Look
at his face he'll kill you.

155
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:22,414
I didn't want to fight but you
haven't leave me any choice.

156
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,815
I'll not spare anything, you'll
take everything in your hand.

157
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,988
Let's go, today will
have to teach you lesson.

158
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,582
Okay, yours...

159
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,737
- what?
- Your dad is college trusty.

160
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,407
- Yes, so?
- If i'll bang you then i'll be expelled.

161
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:52,344
- You'll be banged, understand.
- And nothing will happen to you?

162
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,572
Because it's your father's college.

163
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:59,518
You don't know my father, my band
will be struck more than yours.

164
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,348
What?

165
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,756
- He'll say, it isn't right to act like this, next time.
- Next time don't do it, end.

166
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:08,256
Leave it, my father is hitler... hitler.

167
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:13,765
- What'll he do?
- First of all he'll stop my pocket money.

168
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,733
Every time old-man do the same.

169
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,962
What are you talking about? Then...

170
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,366
...you aren't able to
eat anything in canteen.

171
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:28,780
I have so many friends. This neleash
i fed him too much. Why neleash?

172
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,375
- Off course, dude.
- So sweet, dude.

173
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,820
You are good friends, superb.

174
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:41,248
Okay listen vivak, after all that will
any problem stays between us. Fight finish.

175
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,595
Finish, dude.

176
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:46,587
Is there any gang war
is going on at college?

177
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,591
Will you offer me a drink
in friendship bond?

178
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,959
- Will you offer me?
- Off course.

179
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,562
Nando give two cokes.

180
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,342
- Cheers.
- Hay pay the money.

181
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:09,388
Vivak face was worth
watching after you left.

182
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,324
He stared at coke for two minutes.

183
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,994
And thinking and nobody dared to laugh.

184
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:19,998
But rats you had to gave him one punch.

185
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,367
Aren't your mom wash
your face with soap?

186
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,503
- You use too much abusive language.
- Leave it dude.

187
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,239
I haven't watch your
kind of coward in my life.

188
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,367
It's not about cowardness miyaoon,
i don't like fighting you know that.

189
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,444
Not even to save friend?

190
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:37,541
Vivak isn't my friend and it's much
more necessary to save him from you.

191
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:38,814
Smart.

192
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,249
Fatu. (fatu=coward).

193
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:47,658
- Aditi you are insulting rats.
- Don't call him rats.

194
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,795
Only i can call him rats, okay.

195
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,956
- Rats... rats... rats...
- shut up booms.

196
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:54,689
What happen to you?

197
00:23:56,001 --> 00:24:01,234
I was... i mean... she was fighting
without any reason with aditi so...

198
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:07,312
look friends; i can't do this fighting.
Dad made only one promise with mom...

199
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,439
that i'll never raise
my hand on anybody.

200
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,380
So you can call me coward,
fatu whatever you want to say.

201
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,909
Makes no difference.

202
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:17,713
Hold on... hold on.

203
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,926
If somebody misbehave with me makes
no difference to you, isn't it?

204
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:28,427
If somebody rise hand on me then also
it doesn't makes any difference to you.

205
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:32,861
You'll never rise your
hand on anybody, right?

206
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:35,463
Right.

207
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:39,868
Miyaoon.

208
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,610
- Poor guy.
- I know.

209
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:49,354
- He's only fulfilling his dad's, what's the word?
- Dreams...

210
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,379
following his dad's words.

211
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:53,246
What?

212
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:59,693
Actually savitry aunty
modified truth a little bit.

213
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:04,603
She described jai's dad a
combination of mahatma gandhi and

214
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:09,233
gotham budh but in reality amar
singh rathore was bit different.

215
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:14,745
Amar last time i'm telling you
to stop coming in amar's dreams.

216
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,348
You stop making him coward.

217
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:29,928
I feel shame after seeing him.
He's rathore. Rathore of ranjhor.

218
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:36,299
If i want to make him rathore of
ranjhor then i never quit ranjhore.

219
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:41,907
You and your whole family is mad.

220
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:47,311
Mad, crazy, foolish male.

221
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:52,284
Jai is calm and simple boy
who don't rise hand on anybody.

222
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,343
Will you hide him under your
feathers throughout the life?

223
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:05,423
What do you feel savitri that he'll not carry
his customs after living away from his customs?

224
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:13,861
You can take the rathore out of ranjhor but
you can't take the ranjhor out of the rathore?

225
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:20,946
You'll see savitri, one day he'll
brighten the name of ranjhore,

226
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:27,283
rathore family and whole rajhistan
and you won't able to do anything.

227
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:36,589
Exactly, rathore family of ranjhore
village was very serious due to its manhood.

228
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:41,460
That's why, after amar singh's death
savitri aunty runaway from there.

229
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,269
Then jai was only five years old.

230
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:50,508
It was ranjhore village custom that boy have
to fulfill three conditions to become a man.

231
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:52,669
- What?
- Not now jiggi.

232
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:55,313
Why? She has to know those
three conditions otherwise

233
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,549
how come she understand
the story. Isn't it correct?

234
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,317
I'm not good in storytelling.

235
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,286
Everything has its
right time to come out.

236
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,688
Oh really! Then when
right time will come?

237
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:05,349
- After the end of the story.
- Stop it you two.

238
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,452
Then what happened?

239
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:12,631
Now straight jump on the last day of the college
and our farewell party were at aditi's home.

240
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,901
Where aditi's dad offered
jai a cheque of one million.

241
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,837
To forget aditi.

242
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,930
Oh shit! Really! I don't know.

243
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,535
She's pulling his leg
why are you slipping?

244
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,245
Okay don't do that again.

245
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,803
- Seriously.
- Sorry.

246
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,577
But piji and pumpkin are
the world's coolest parents.

247
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,172
Okay... okay... wait for me...

248
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,244
where are you?

249
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,957
We were talking about that day fight.

250
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,619
Look scratch is still on vivak's face.

251
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,862
Aditi lets dance.

252
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,399
Dance.

253
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,869
- And me.
- A little bit. One dance.

254
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:32,366
Rotu my lovely rotu if i'll dance then
rest of the party will be at garden.

255
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:49,817
Let's go.

256
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,297
- Jai let's dance.
- Sure one second.

257
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,738
Let's go miyaoon your attitude is enough.

258
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,906
You'll not dance today then
you'll never dance in life.

259
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,343
Jai breaking news i can't dance.

260
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:07,573
I know only papoo can't dance.

261
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:11,179
- I forgot.
- Go to dance floor then i'll show you.

262
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,982
- What we have to talk?
- May be he don't want to marry right now.

263
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:49,224
So it's alright, we only
talk about engagement.

264
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:53,855
Aditi is 20 years old. She is
with along with jai for five years.

265
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:59,502
Before that different kind of questions
rise up in the family, we do the announcement.

266
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:00,794
What do you think?

267
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,609
- Otherwise so many proposals will come.
- Absolutely.

268
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,539
So shall i talk to jai's mother?

269
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,343
First talk to jai. It'll be better.

270
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:21,189
Coca-cola on the rocks.

271
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:31,197
- Once more.
- Be careful friend.

272
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:32,531
Make it strong.

273
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:44,770
What happen routlu? Say it.

274
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:52,356
Nothing dude. Sometimes i
feel... i wish there is somebody.

275
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:55,655
- Who?
- Anybody.

276
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:01,623
To whom i'm visible and i can see her.

277
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,862
And then rest of the world go to hell.

278
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,906
Like jai and aditi.

279
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,350
- Rautlu... rautlu...
- enough.

280
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:36,289
Cheeky tell me, if you'll fall
in love then which song you sing?

281
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:37,484
Me?

282
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,354
Just a second.

283
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,377
Jai which song you'll sing?

284
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,212
Sorry a secret.

285
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:08,887
- That i'll sing only for her.
- Rats will you sing or have a slap?

286
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,896
Are paying mercy?

287
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,290
What a demo is it?

288
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:22,301
Madam.

289
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,232
Amit you son of a bitch.

290
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:55,606
Amit once you haven't looks
nice. Second you are poor. Third

291
00:37:55,606 --> 00:38:00,311
if you sing like this then
which girl gone like you, jai?

292
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:04,915
Some poor or simple girl will be
found. Who sings much worse than me?

293
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:08,919
Sad. Aditi isn't poor otherwise
you can marry with her.

294
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:12,890
Amit don't be an ass. Go to your
room otherwise you gona have a slap.

295
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:18,362
I was in my room. I was studding
peacefully when you frogs disturbed. And

296
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:23,857
this is my home too, understand. Tell
all of them to go home. Let's go. Come.

297
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,311
Amit... amit.

298
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,481
Pijay and pumpkin are also worried.

299
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,916
Don't know what they do
in their room all day?

300
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,954
- Not working nor studying.
- But he paints.

301
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:58,269
What he paints? In my opinion
he just need a physiatrist.

302
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:01,136
Hello! Your brother is
sharper then all of us.

303
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:05,607
Are you mad? He insults you
more than anybody in the world.

304
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,547
Yes so he can get some reaction.

305
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:14,348
- What kind of reaction?
- Your anger.

306
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:23,350
Let's go goodnight. I pick you
up for college tomorrow morning.

307
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:25,354
Alright.

308
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,600
- Hi savitri aunty.
- Hi.

309
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:37,340
- What happen?
- Suddenly she realizes that college is over.

310
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,799
Sit, i bring water.

311
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:41,174
Sit.

312
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,548
Poor baby.

313
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,277
So now what's next?

314
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,387
- Further studies or...
- i haven't think on it till now aunty.

315
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,912
Don't know where college
five years has gone?

316
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,357
On phone beta. One
phone. (beta=daughter).

317
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:01,332
But you know jai was telling me that
you are thinking to join film school.

318
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:04,267
Yes, but dad is saying to do mba.

319
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:10,239
He has a point but now these days we
badly need intelligent film makers.

320
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:15,513
I mean for how long this silly movies will be
on? All this violence, gore, mixture and nonsense.

321
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:18,311
Don't waste your time mom because aditi
also going to make these mixture movies.

322
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:22,382
- You don't say.
- Whom you are listening aunty?

323
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:26,419
- Piji wants to meet you tomorrow morning.
- Why?

324
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:31,385
Do you forget his promise? College
finish welcome to the family.

325
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:44,608
- The jai singh rathore.
- Suite belongs to your father or it was rented.

326
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:47,344
Now everybody can't follow your style.

327
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:53,818
Dude tell me one thing, all the time that much
sweet and polite, can't you bore of yourself?

328
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,445
Amit shut up.

329
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,886
Here comes your watch-women.

330
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:03,794
Don't say anything to your
jai, he'll feel so hurt.

331
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:08,399
Amit i'm warning you. Yesterday
night i wasn't say anything.

332
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,765
Nothing, come on are you jerk?

333
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,396
Open the door i'll teach you a lesson.

334
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:15,363
God damn.

335
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:24,415
- Aditi.
- Listen.

336
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,507
Amit stop it.

337
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,288
- He started.
- Quite... quite...

338
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:32,623
i don't want to hear anything.

339
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:36,855
Err guest come at home. Go
and set yourselves properly.

340
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,461
Come son, we'll talk differently.

341
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:50,040
- Wow nice! Somebody is looking handsome.
- Somebody is looking gorgeous.

342
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,530
Okay, thank you.

343
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,002
- Sit... sit... sit...
- thank you.

344
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,751
So both of you will
together take my interview?

345
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:01,775
Interview.

346
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:10,192
Do you know why we call you over here?

347
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:14,594
- I think yes.
- So you are ready?

348
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:22,840
Yes. I means i was thinking first i do
mba but it can be done later on. Isn't it?

349
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,276
Yes... why not but son are you sure?

350
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:30,339
Yes absolutely, have to
do something for money.

351
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:32,917
For money?

352
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:42,560
Not only for money, status, respect,
success. Everything starts from here.

353
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,963
But jai, is money that much necessary?

354
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,665
If that is only about money
that i can't be that much happy.

355
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:53,393
I love you guys.

356
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:57,397
If i stay with you guys then
i feel that i'm at my home.

357
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,709
But your mother?

358
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:07,217
She'll be very happy and
she was waiting for that day.

359
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,652
How is it going guys?

360
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:14,725
Beta jai is frankly saying that
he's doing all this for money.

361
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:16,260
Obviously. So...

362
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,458
and after marriage he wants to stay
with us like a housemaster son-in-law.

363
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:27,398
- Excuse me.
- Wedding

364
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,400
who's wedding? Housemaster
son-in-law means what?

365
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:36,274
Jai are you willing to marry me?

366
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:42,252
- Oh shit!
- When did i talk about wedding?

367
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:44,588
Means what we were
talking about till now?

368
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,790
I was talking about job.

369
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,848
What job?

370
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:51,362
You said that when your
college is over so i join you.

371
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:52,886
I felt that you called
me for that purpose.

372
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:59,536
- What about wedding? You want to marry me.
- How dare you think such like that?

373
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:01,472
Ask your parents.

374
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,607
- Jesus.
- Christ.

375
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:07,544
They didn't want to
marry but that's crazy.

376
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:12,916
You said that from the first day of the college love
and always stay together and made for each other.

377
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:16,387
Like all of us aditi's
parents were confused.

378
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:17,354
Yeah.

379
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:20,380
The matter was that jai
and aditi were not in love.

380
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,493
Not in love.

381
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,827
Of course not.

382
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,557
- How could you think about it?
- What is the need to think in it?

383
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:32,336
Always you stay together or on phone. We haven't
saw you separated for five years so we think...

384
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,600
mom at least had to asked me once?

385
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,608
God this is so embarrassing.

386
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,439
- Shit...
- it's okay.

387
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:45,883
Alright. If you felt like this so thanks
you tried but nothing is such like this.

388
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:49,375
- Confirm you don't want to marry.
- Mom please.

389
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:55,921
We are sorry. We both are sorry.
We are too much ashamed off.

390
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:11,372
Enough! That's enough,
we'll finish this topic here.

391
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,246
But seriously there's one thing,
no matter what you don't want to

392
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:20,215
each other, but you wants to marry.
Yeah, definitely.

393
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:25,217
When we like someone, from that way.
Someone?

394
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:28,514
And how would you find that someone?
Why?

395
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,887
It will be found when time will come.
Allright.

396
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:36,860
From last five years how many guys
you have been noticed?

397
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:43,339
And that someone, your mr. Right will
sit next to you,

398
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,404
and you both will be laugh on him.

399
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:51,505
And if you found that someone, then
what do you think?

400
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:54,648
He wouldn't have problem with this
kind of friendship,

401
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:58,519
look! It's your life and you have to
think about this.

402
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:03,189
We all want that we found someone
special but how?

403
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,363
You both are meant to be special
for each other.

404
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,226
You tell me if you are in love with
aditi, then would you have

405
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:14,166
any problem?

406
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:16,269
Me?

407
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:20,674
I wouldn't tell you because i thought

408
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:26,315
that you and aditi are...
it's true we'll never find in life.

409
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,851
Nonsense!
We will find that special person.

410
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:34,280
And definitely we will find, wherever
he is hidden.

411
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:42,361
You looking for a guy?
Yeah! For you.

412
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,798
Idiot!

413
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:51,665
Hey! Correct, you both know each
other very well,

414
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:54,443
you have to find love for each other.

415
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:01,276
Jignesh patel!
Perfect plan.

416
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:03,816
It's completely makes sense,
look! Jai!

417
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,051
If aditi found a girl for you,
he let you meet her.

418
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:12,186
Either she supports your romance,
then why she have a problem with aditi

419
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,298
guys!
That's brilliant.

420
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:21,496
Jai! Sit!

421
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:26,269
Jai! I'll find you a stupid, silly,
romantic girl.

422
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,676
And you find a tough guy for me.

423
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:31,710
What do you say?
Superb!

424
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,943
Are you with us?
Ofcourse!

425
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,717
It's our time too.

426
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:43,591
Who knows? May be we'll find a
special person like crying bombs.

427
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:15,256
All these are with me.

428
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,160
I told you, today will be cover
charge, i can't come.

429
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:25,294
Come on boms, let's go somewhere else,

430
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,600
it's your old habit,
jigi, you pay for it.

431
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,236
Make it fast, our love is calling us,
come on, come on.

432
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:36,309
Don't worry,
i'll pay you when i'll get a job.

433
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:39,545
It's an account,
mine too.

434
00:48:56,233 --> 00:49:00,829
Listen! Park it carefully,
sorry sir, we don't park horses,

435
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,336
take it, and listen!
Drink him some water.

436
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:19,781
Did i saw two guys came to disco
on horses?

437
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:24,155
I love this city,
anything could happen here.

438
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:06,968
They will never find someone else
in life.

439
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:11,341
I don't understand that why they
don't love each other?

440
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:52,846
Go, and take out the car,
what?

441
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,713
Go fast, start the car, i'm coming, \

442
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,232
you want me to hit you?
One minute,

443
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:18,798
please get away from it,
it's our personal matter.

444
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,674
I went to doctor,
why?

445
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,872
My reports has come,
you knew it, you knew it.

446
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:30,251
You knew it, and that night you
did with me.

447
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,758
Why nalini?
Don't be dramatic,

448
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:40,320
i have seen your scarface behind this
innocent face.

449
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:42,956
How many people you want to
give this sickness?

450
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:47,494
How many people you will drink them
death wine of your lust?

451
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:51,940
What they both have done wrong with
you?

452
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:57,337
Why you are behind these youth?

453
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:01,249
Look!

454
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:05,219
I am taking her to hospital,
do you have any problem?

455
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:08,290
No!
Thanks!

456
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:14,261
Don't be scare, this sickness
don't effect from touch.

457
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:18,264
Come on! Nalini!
No!

458

00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:32,272

461
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,270
Meghna! Right?

462
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,344

me, aditi, jai's best friend.

464
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,413
Just friends? Aren't you?

465
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:19,319
Before they thought there's something
between me and jai, but it wasn't.

466
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:22,664
Guys! There was something like that?
No!

467
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:34,937
Guys! Do we have a coffee?
Coffee! Coffee!

468
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,916
I am getting late, i should leave.

469
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,792
One coffee,
i am really getting late.

470
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:57,932
I'll carry you on,
i'll drop you.

471
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,198
Ok!

472
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:05,172
Guys! Guys!

473
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:11,280
Jai!

474
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:18,685
Shall we?
Ah!

475
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:21,857
Let's rock!

476
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:02,223
Jai singh rathore,
isn't it heavy name?

477
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:06,630
I've heard my garndpa wanted to
suggets my name zoravar singh rathore

478
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:10,232
that means zorro,
then?

479
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:12,541
Mom said that she fly jump from
third from.

480
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:16,276
But grandpa forgot that there was
two floors in our palace.

481
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:21,406
You lived in palace that actually
your name

482
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:26,314
should be his royal highness raj kumar
jai singh rathore.

483
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:30,218
Well! Your friends thinks you
are a prince.

484
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:32,422
They were talking about you all the
way.

485
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:39,234
I think that all was for you,
for me?

486
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:41,928
Why?

487
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:57,377
Why did you refused to marry with
jai?

488
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:00,219
What's the reason? He is poor
or ugly?

489
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,318
I am not in the mood of fighting.

490
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:16,671
May i sit for two minutes?

491
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,948
We were friends before?
What happen?

492
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:38,786
Why did you go so far away from me?
I went so far?

493
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:40,295
Really?

494
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,428
I was thinking today,

495
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,300
when any new factory has started
then why dad has gone to start it,

496
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:57,277
why not grandpa or uncle?
So?

497
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:02,375
Change your home, school,
are you mad?

498
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,884
I loved it, new place, new school,
new friends,

499
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:14,359
and that chinki, who came everyday
to play with you.

500
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:17,758
Shiya!
Shiya! Cute girl.

501
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:21,830
And in banglore,
that guy.

502
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:26,333
I teased you, your boy friend,
rana!

503
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:28,902
Rana!
He was just punk.

504
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:34,640
And that miss. Coaching, rag
laxmi ayer

505
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,446
poor! She did my entire home work,

506
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,412
do you remember any friend of mine?

507
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:47,594
Shit!

508
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:50,833
Even not any single.

509
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:54,703
Because i always had a friend.

510
00:57:57,006 --> 00:58:00,840
I went to dehli and other people
came near to you.

511
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:20,321
I had other friends too,
so what?

512
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:23,461
What does it matter in our friendship?

513
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:25,858
Really?

514
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,197
And if tomorrow,
what's his name?

515
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:33,205
Yes! Jai!
Then if tomorrow jai,

516
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:37,878
didn't stay with you everytime,
and someone else nearby him,

517
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:40,340
that you won't care,
ofcourse not,

518
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,286
like today, i found a girlfriend
for jai,

519
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:48,347
but me and jai are...
what you've done?

520
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:51,317
Found a girlfriend for jai.

521
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,171
You found a girlfriend for jai.

522
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:18,215
Jai!
What's this?

523
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:26,888
He's a giant who ate fairy's mischief
son,

524
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,298
and he's dancing in his stomach.

525
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:34,236
Fairy's mischief son?

526
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:38,939
Meghna always played,
world is not like it's shown.

527
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,436
There is magic hidden is everything.

528
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,611
And she called this game what's this,

529
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:46,881
for example, what's this?

530
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:49,678
A trolly with full of luggages.

531
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:57,217
This is a giant cake with chocolate,
blueberry and strawberry icing.

532
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:08,331
So!

533

01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,768
don't call her that,

616
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:39,673
like you don't know she loves you,
mom, she's a rotlu's girlfriend.

617
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:43,300
Who loves aditi,
nice group.

618
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:46,473
Mom!
Good night.

619
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:48,682
Stop!

620
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:52,254
What's her name?

621
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:55,881
Meghna!

622
01:09:57,626 --> 01:09:58,388
Tell me the whole story,

623
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:03,487
perfect timing,

624
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:09,365
hello!

625
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:21,310
Mother! Mother! Come mother!

626
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:24,742
Long time no see,

627
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:31,923
i've never seen a unjustice, cruel
police officer like you.

628
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:36,891
No! There are lot of guys in
force like me.

629
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:40,829
You're making me a mock,
don't you regret for anything?

630
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:44,369
That boy's hand has broken, he got
a fracture,

631
01:10:44,369 --> 01:10:44,704
that boy's hand has broken, he got
a fracture,

632
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:47,408
that was fine, from which hand he
stole, that hand has fractured.

633
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:51,311
If he stole, suppose he's a thief,

634
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,941
then find a proof, submit in court.

635
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:57,250
What's the meaning to hit him?

636
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:01,381
You have much time,

637
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:05,285
i investigate this matter just for
the transistor of rs. 1280.

638
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:09,557
Get some proof, take him to court
and send him to majestrate.

639
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:14,200
Give him two slaps and case finish.

640
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:20,638
You wants me to slap but it's natural,

641
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:25,205
if i didn't make you suspence then
my name is not savitri longer.

642
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:27,647
Allright!

643
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:31,352
How do you like champa?

644
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:44,924
Say it again,

645
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:48,963
what?

646
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:51,965
Say it again,

647
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:02,348
let's go from here,
for my sake let's go from here,

648
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:08,514
come here, you're showing your
eyes to a police officer.

649
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:11,588
I say it again,
champa!

650
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:13,652
Chameli!

651
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:16,455
Charulata!

652
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:20,933
What?
I forgot,

653
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:23,494
jai! What you suppose to do there?

654
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,373
You were suppose to hit him?

655
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:31,872
To a police officer?
He was misbehaving with you,

656
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,812
that's my problem.

657
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:40,254
And to fought with him you proved
him right.

658
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:43,357
Then what would be the difference
remains between my son and him?

659
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:21,354
What wrong my son did?

660
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:25,365
Somebody misbehave with his mother,
and he shouldn't say something,

661
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,268
amar! Don't start it again, please!

662
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,303
What do you mean? Do not
start it again.

663
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:30,597
I mean, enough.

664
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:34,332
I don't want to discuss ten times a
day,

665
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:40,940
if you wanted to made jai like you
then you should thought before death,

666
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:45,285
you want to make him coward,

667
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:49,713
he's the son of amar singh rathore,

668
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:51,883
that's what i am afraid of,

669
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:54,552
and i am afraid of this thing since

670
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:57,799
you went on horse to fight with some
family

671
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,800
and never come back alive,
so what i died in fight,

672
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:05,330
i was alone, i slap ten people before
death,

673
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:07,739
that eleven one attacked me from
behind.

674
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:12,843
If you came back alive to get ten
slaps then i would be happy,

675
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:17,582
you are a widow of a martyr.

676
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:20,347
You should be proud,
amar!

677
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:23,319
I'll kill you to enter in painting.

678
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:28,258
Why i am listening this?
Good night,

679
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:30,762

680

One day jai will be complete three
conditions of ranjhor's man.

681
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:41,832

01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:43,642

01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:54,312

685
01:14:56,258 --> 01:14:57,987

rathore man, lmpossible.

687
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:07,367
Jai wouldn't did it ever.

688
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:09,464
Did he?
Does he?

689
01:15:10,772 --> 01:15:13,206
Whom he will kill?
That inspector.

690
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:17,403
And he'll really go to jail?
