00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:10,414
All those men are so old,
it'd be like playing snooker with a rope.

[Chuckling]

311
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,683
You know, those people are sad.

312
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,413
-You're sad.
-No.

313
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,287
I'm depressed. There's a difference.

314
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,752
I wish you'd get a life.

315
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:25,418
I wish you would.

316
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:28,760
Yes, I know you do.

317
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,236
Toby, I'm telling you, that's the number.
You've gotta believe me.

318
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,933
Oh, come on, Toby, don't be like that.
We're friends. Aren't we friends?

319
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:41,206
Well, I like you. Look,
would you believe it if Heck told you?

320
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,713
You would? Thank you very much.

321
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,106
Hey, Toby.

322
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,913
Yeah, I know.
Weird, but believe him, okay?

323
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,322
Okay. Speak to you soon.

324
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,852
All good.

325
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:59,889
-You see, the truth never fails.
-Yeah, except we were lying.

326
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,157
Hmm.

327
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,869
Sorry I'm late, beautiful person.

328
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,707
-You look spectacular.
-How was work?

329
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,310
Shite. Quitting.

330
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,006
You always say that.

331
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,481
[Sighing] Just watch me. One day, I'll do it.

332
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:24,648
Tell them I don't like them or their cash.
Although I do like their cash.

333
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,086
Whatever. I'll think of something
and then walk out.

334

[Toilet flushing]

335
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,921
I'll be waiting with champagne.

336
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,559
How much do I wish it was just us tonight.

337
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,725
He'll definitely be into her, right?

338
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,998
-Coop? He'll fancy Luce?
-She's got a pulse, hasn't she?

339
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:44,041
No, but, I mean.... You do. You would?

340
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:48,169
Well, she's not really my bag of chips,
darling, but, yeah, I suppose.

341
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:53,148
-Oh, what do you think?
-Of her? I haven't really--

00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,947
Oh, no, no. The shirt?

343

Oh, uh....

-It's gorgeous. You're gorgeous.
-Yeah?

-Thank you.

-Hey.
-Hi.

-So, come check out our new sofa.
-Our expensive new sofa.

-You can't put a price on comfort.
-You see, a woman after my own heart.

Listen, do you believe in reincarnation?

357
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,988
It's just that Rach thought
you guys had met before.

-That's not quite what l--
-I'd have remembered, I think.

359
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,760
Well, let's hang these flowers
and get that jacket in some water.

-I'll do it.

-Thanks.
-Thank you, darling.

00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,408
HECK: Well, so, basically,
the book I've wanted to write is...

363
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:57,141
a guide to wherever is the coolest place
on the planet at the time.

364
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,376
If it's February, it's the Rio Carnival.

365
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:03,420
And if it's, I don't know, May,
it's bulls in Pamplona.

366
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,149
So, if you...

367
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:09,751
want a holiday/party, then,
you know, you open the book...

ever gonna be married?

It's been three weeks now.

Let's have it.
How much better is sex after marriage?

-Please.
-Because, when I've had sex...

with people after they were married,
they have said that it's fantastic.

-Rach?
-Get wed and find out yourself.

Come on, Cooper couldn't make
that commitment.

We're talking about two or three years
of his life.

Well, not a one-person person.

You really don't think
your other half's out there?

-Or, you know, in here?
-Actually, Rach--

399

What, there's some
gorgeous women around.

400
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:38,114
Yes, there are, and I'm trying to
sleep with as many as I can.

401
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,649
And you never fail, do you?

402
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,776
You know, they teach the birds
and the bees about me.

It'll all change when you meet Miss Right.

405
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,188
And how am I supposed to know
when I do that?

406
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,989
You don't know, not straight away.
It just feels...

407
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,191
warm and comfortable...

408
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,430
and you hang in there and give it a chance,
before you know it, you're like...

00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,302
"Yeah, this is it. Must be love."

-Yeah, I'm with her.
-I'm with her, too. Give me that.

412
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,308
I think you know immediately.
You know, as soon as your eyes....

413
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,344
Then everything that happens
from then on, just proves...

414
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,820
that you had been right
in that first moment.

415
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:21,120
When you suddenly realized you had
been incomplete and now you are whole.

416
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,062
-Actually, I'm with her, I'd say.
-I'm with her, too.

417
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,530
Sorted. So, who's for pudding?

418
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,930
-Yes.
-No.

419
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,127
-No?
-No.

420
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:34,728
If you think that, you think that
everyone that doesn't have all that...

421
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,037
business is settling for less.

422
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,237
-That's not what I'm saying.
-That kind of is what you're saying.

423
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,472
I think she said it a bit nicer.

424
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,275

-Shite. I'm quitting.
-Did you check out flower girl back there?

427
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:53,786
Made that speech for me.

-It's going very well.

She's a lesbian.

Is that right? Cool.

432
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,271
You don't think that slightly impedes
your plans for seduction?

433
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:13,303
Anyone can change teams.

434
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,745
Not anyone. I wouldn't....
'Cause, you know.... But anyone, I mean....

435
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,854
What are you doing?

00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,295
-It's gorgeous.
-It's raining.

437
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,532
Heck won't come up here.

438
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,002
They say it's subconscious fear
you'll throw yourself off...

439
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:48,978
but he freaks when I go near the edge, too.

440
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,206
Sorry about dinner.

441
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,777
I've eaten worse.

442
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,226
-Kind of went off.
-You didn't go off.

443
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,762
You went a little way off.

444
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,460
-You're wet.
-I'm fine.

445
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,264
-And you're cold.
-I'm fine!

446
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,770
-You can have it. Really, you can have it.
-I'm so fine.

447
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,204
-It's fine. Well--
-Okay, now you're cold.

448
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,969
Hey, what are you guys up to?

449
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,202
Nothing.

450
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,142
Well, Coop wants to play
strip poker or strip Cooper...

451
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,148
and I really want him to go home.

452
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,647
-Good night.
-See you soon.

453
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,947
-Two.
-Thanks for dinner.

454
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:31,489
Bye.

455
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,282
Cheers, Coop.

LUCE: Next left.
COOP: It's one option, yes.

457
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,233
COOP: How about instead, we just go
straight back to my place?

458
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,862
LUCE: Coop, take the next left.

459
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:52,640
-You all right, Luce?
-Why, 'cause I don't want to shag you?

460
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:58,206
You're welcome not to shag me,
just don't sit in my car all bored like that.

461
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,549
