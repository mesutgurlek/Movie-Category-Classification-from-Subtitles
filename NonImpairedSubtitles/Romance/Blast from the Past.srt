1
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,700
Calvin, where do you get these?

2
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,900
They're so funny.

3
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,800
Just remember
don't mention the communists.

4
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Calvin's a great guy,
but he's a little--you know.

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
-Nutty.
-What's his wife like?

6
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,000
You know...housewife.

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,800
Likes to cook, pregnant.

8
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,200
Normal, then.

9
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,200
I wouldn't go that far.

10
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,600
-Helen!
-Oh, hi, Betty. Hi, Dave.

11
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,700
Just look at you.

12
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,100
Any day now.

13
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,400
Say hi to my sister
Ruth and her husband.

14
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,500
Tell me
if you've heard this one.

15
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,700
A duck walks into a drugstore.

16
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,200
He says,
"I'd like some lip gloss."

17
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,400
The clerk says, "Certainly, sir.
Will this be cash or check?"

18
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,200
The duck says,
"Put it on my bill."

19
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,600
Oh, brother.

20
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,100
He was the golden boy
professor at Cal Tech...

21
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,700
but then he started
inventing things.

22
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,700
He suddenly became very rich.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,500
And that was it.
He quit teaching.

24
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,700
-How's that?
-Just what the doctor ordered.

25
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,400
Calvin spends
all of his time out there...

26
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,700
tinkering around
in the workshop.

27
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,300
If you ask me,
it's all very strange.

28
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,500
Same is true of batteries.

29
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,500
I could take
a simple yacht battery...

30
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,300
and rig it
to last a decade, easily.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Say, Helen,
what does Calvin think...

32
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,100
about this trouble down in Cuba?

33
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,700
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
please don't bring that up.

34
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,300
I'd say my baseball card
collection is as complete...

35
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,100
as any one I've ever seen.

36
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,700
Calvin! Kennedy is going
toe-to-toe with Khruschev...

37
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,500
on television right now.

38
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,900
Ooh, boy.

39
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,800
On the island of Cuba.

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,300
Unmistakable evidence
has established the fact...

41
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,800
that a series
of offensive missile sites...

42
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,200
is now in preparation
on that imprisoned island.

43
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,400
Tower, this is Wolf One. I got
five miles to the overhead.

44
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,100
Wolf One, Tower.
Report the numbers.

45
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,800
You're number one
for the overhead.

46
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,500
Tower, this is Wolf One.
I got a problem here.

47
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,800
State your problem, Wolf One.
Are you declaring an emergency?

48
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,700
Stand by, One.

49
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,600
Additional sites
appear to be designed...

50
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,400
for intermediate-range
ballistic missiles...

51
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,800
and thus capable of striking
most of the major cities...

52
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,700
in the western hemisphere.

53
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,500
Folks.

54
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,800
Given this extraordinary
turn of events...

55
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,700
I think it's prudent
we cut this evening short.

56
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,700
I'm sure this Cuban thing
will resolve itself...

57
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,500
but in the meantime,
I suggest we take...

58
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,000
a prayerful
watch and wait stance.

59
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,600
OK, folks, let's go.

60
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,800
-My coat.
-Oh, here you go.

61
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
I'll call you, then.

62
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,700
What did I tell you?

63
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,900
Well, I'm certainly not gonna
let this pot roast go to waste.

64
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,700
Oh, Calvin, would you
put that seat cushion...

65
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,300
back on the lawn chair, honey?

66
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Shouldn't we at least
turn off the phonograph?

67
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,300
It shuts off automatically.

68
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh. Did you make it to do that?

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,200
They all do.

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,200
I never know anymore.

71
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,100
I bet that's a fighter jet
on its way to Key West.

72
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,500
Good luck, amigo.

73
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,000
An emergency has been declared.

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,300
I repeat,
an emergency has been declared.

75
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,500
You hear that?

76
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,700
I'll come back for the radio.

77
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,000
I wish you would have
at least let me do the dishes.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,100
It's not gonna be that easy...

79
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,600
to get all that dried-on food
off my nice plates.

80
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,600
I just hope those plates are not
radioactive by tomorrow.

81
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,900
Cheese
is particularly troublesome.

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I've got secondaries
of an engine fire.

83
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,100
I'm gonna need to find
a clear area to eject.

84
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,400
Roger, Wolf One.
Can you make it to the ocean?

85
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,100
Roger that, Tower.

86
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,700
I'm marking the one-eight-zero
radio for five...

87
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,600
and ejecting, Tower.

88
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,100
Roger, Wolf One.

89
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,900
How long will we have
to stay down here?

90
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,400
For this thing to blow over
could take days.

91
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,600
Days?

92
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,500
What if I go into labor?

93
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,800
That could happen any time now.

94
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,000
I've read up on it.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,900
If I have to,
I'll deliver the baby myself.

96
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,000
Home, sweet home.

97
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,500
To you, maybe.

98
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,600
Are you all right?

99
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,100
I think so.

100
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,500
It's happened!

101
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,800
Look at that heat!

102
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
All my surface indicators...

103
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,700
knocked out! Oh, Lord!

104
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,300
It's happened!

105
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,500
What was that noise?

106
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,400
- The locks.
- The locks?

107
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,800
To keep us from trying to leave.

108
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,700
There's a radiation half-life
after an atomic blast.

109
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,500
-It lasts thirty-five years.- Thirty-five years?

110
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,400
Then after that,
it's safe to go up.

111
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,200
According to Cal Tech...

112
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,200
this Webber guy
was a bona fide genius...

113
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,600
but a borderline nut case.

114
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,800
He and Mrs. Nut Case...

115
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,500
must have been out here
when the plane hit.

116
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,300
Unless we get a postcard or
something, that'd be my guess.

117
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,400
What about relatives?

118
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,900
They're all back east.

119
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,300
Neighbors said the guy
spent day and night out here.

120
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,000
She'd bring him sandwiches
and hot Dr. Pepper.

121
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,400
He drank it hot?

122
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,400
Good God.

123
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,200
Hi, hon.

124
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,300
Feeling better?

125
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,600
We have to be strong.

126
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,000
If not for ourselves...

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,500
for the child.

128
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,900
All our friends.

129
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,200
Burnt to a crisp.

130
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,800
I'm not hungry.

131
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,100
Hot Dr. Pepper--your favorite.

132
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,100
No, Calvin. Your favorite.

133
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,800
Really?

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Chilly? You shouldn't be.

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,600
Temperature's
a nice seventy-three degrees.

136
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
Maybe I've just got the creeps.

137
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,200
How could you?
This is just like home.

138
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,400
This is different.

139
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,000
Believe me.

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,800
Would you like a tranquilizer?

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,600
You've got tranquilizers?

142
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,500
I told you I have everything.

143
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,400
What?

144
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,900
Oh, hon.

145
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,700
Just breathe.

146
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,300
I'll get my stuff.

147
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,700
Is there a problem?

148
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,700
No, Calvin. Babies cry.

149
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,700
I've noticed.

150
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,200
What shall we call him?

151
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,200
I don't know.

152
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
Well, I was thinking,
in light of the situation...

153
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,300
we should call him Adam.

154
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,900
That's not sacrilegious, is it?

155
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,500
No. I think it's just right.

156
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,000
And I was wondering if...if...

157
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,500
Whatever you want, Helen.

158
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,100
I want a bedroom ceiling.

159
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,100
You got it.

160
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
See, I flick this switch...

161
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,100
and the image is projected
onto a mirror...

162
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
and the picture
comes out here...

163
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,600
and it's perfect.

164
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,800
Well, almost perfect.

165
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,300
You know something?

166
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,400
People will never get tired
of watching these.

167
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,800
Lord, bless this food...

168
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,100
this family...

169
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
and make us ever mindful...

170
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,200
of the needs of others. Amen.

171
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,200
Let's eat.

172
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,100
Out here, hon.

173
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,900
Oh, there you are.

174
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,100
Looked all over for you.

175
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,200
What are you doing back here?

176
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,600
I was just examining
this rear hatchway.

177
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,800
Why?

178
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,200
It's pretty clear
that when the bomb went off...

179
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,700
the front entrance caved in,
so, you know...

180
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,400
we'll have to return
to the surface...

181
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,000
using this back entrance,
which is very nice...

182
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
because it has
the service elevator.

183
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Unless it's caved in, too.

184
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,900
Well, yes.

185
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,200
You wanted to see me?

186
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,000
Yes. You ready, Adam?

187
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,400
Watch this.

188
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,900
He can stand up all by himself.

189
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,200
Show Daddy.

190
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,800
All by himself.

191
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,200
That's my guy.

192
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,400
Stand up.

193
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,000
My son.

194
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,600
Up, Adam...

195
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,100
to the moon.

196
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,400
Hey, boss,
what do you make of this?

197
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,600
Damn if I know.

198
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,000
Bet it's some kind
of septic tank.

199
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,000
I never seen a septic tank
that looked like that.

200
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,200
Well, don't fool with it.

201
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,600
If it is a septic tank, I sure
as hell don't want to open it.

202
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,600
We'll just lay
the foundation over it.

203
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,400
"In won-der-land."

204
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,200
I'd like to see the public
school system match that.

205
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
I don't care how terrific it is.

206
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,500
But, honey, don't you think
he's a little young for school?

207
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,600
People have no idea what
the human mind is capable of.

208
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,800
Look, Daddy.

209
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,600
Alice went down the hole...

210
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,700
just like us.

211
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,400
Will I ever get to go up on top?

212
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,300
Yes. You certainly will.

213
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,300
And you'll find a nice girl...

214
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,900
rebuild America
just the way it used to be.

215
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,700
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure
we should be making promises...

216
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,000
that perhaps can't be kept.

217
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,900
I'm convinced
there'll be other survivors.

218
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,600
In fact, I'm guessing there's
life on the surface even now.

219
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,200
Not life worth living,
perhaps...

220
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,800
but believe me...

221
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
something is moving around
up there.

222
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,600
I'm gonna need two more
banana splits and a Cherry Coke.

223
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,500
You bet, Mom. Comin' up.

224
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,100
Oh, by the way, Mom,
thanks for the job.

225
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,200
Buck fifteen an hour.

226
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,200
Your husband is crazy.

227
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,800
All right. What's the big news?

228
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,900
Oh, you're a riot.

229
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,700
Oh, what a riot you are!

230
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,800
Watch this.

231
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,000
You're funny!

232
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,900
You're a real riot.

233
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
They're comin' now
to put you on the stage.

234
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
There's been complaints
about me on the bus.

235
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,400
He's sending me
to the company psychiatrist.

236
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,000
Psychiatrist?

237
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,100
Yeah, a psychiatrist,
and that means I'm crazy.

238
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,800
Oh, don't be silly, Ralph.

239
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,200
Sending you to a psychiatrist
doesn't mean you're crazy.

240
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Stick it. That's right.

241
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,700
Hook off the jab.

242
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,000
That's right.

243
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,800
Excuse me, boys, but I believe
it's my turn now.

244
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,600
Four, five.

245
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,400
Five, six.

246
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,800
And six, spin.

247
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,400
May I cut in?

248
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,000
You certainly may.

249
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,600
Thank you, son.

250
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
I miss those nice
flower-power kids.

251
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,700
How 'bout you?

252
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,800
What the hell
kind of music is that?

253
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,700
Oh, man.

254
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,300
I'm not sure I like that.

255
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,300
These are stock certificates.

256
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,300
Your Mom and I bought them,
for you.

257
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,600
Of course,
they're worthless now...

258
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,500
but at one time
they were quite valuable.

259
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,300
They're pretty.
Could I have them?

260
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,900
Sure.

261
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,200
Now let's move on
to our French exam.

262
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,300
Latin exam, Dad. It's Tuesday.

263
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,800
Gosh, it is Tuesday.

264
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,900
Time flies, doesn't it?

265
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,500
Tempus fugit.

266
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,200
You have a wonderful
sense of humor, son, I must say.

267
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,000
The acorn does not fall
very far from the tree.

268
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,500
Gotcha, I gotcha.

269
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,900
This is wonderful.

270
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,000
That's my baseball card
collection.

271
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,300
It's yours now.

272
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,400
What's baseball?

273
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,600
It's a game, son.

274
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,500
I can explain it pretty easily.

275
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,000
You see, there's a pitcher.

276
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,400
Oh, like a painting?

277
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,000
No. A pit-cher.

278
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,400
Like one of Mom's?

279
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,300
No. There's a man
who throws the ball...

280
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,500
to a man who has a bat.

281
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,500
Oh, the nocturnal flying mammal.

282
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,500
I'm sellin' this place.

283
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,800
I want out of this hellhole.

284
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,100
Could I, uh...

285
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,600
If you sell, uh...

286
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,700
Me, could I, uh...

287
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,400
Buy it from me?

288
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,000
Yeah! Yeah, that's it!

289
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,000
I'll give it to you.
No money down.

290
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,200
Cool!

291
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,900
This neighborhood's
gone to hell anyway.

292
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,100
At last...

293
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,000
I am master of all I survey!

294
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,100
No, no. Listen...

295
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,600
I'm only gonna explain
this one more time.

296
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,400
The runner on second
goes to third.

297
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
It's--He's out there.

298
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,600
Why?

299
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,900
Because he's forced out.
It's--it's a force.

300
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,100
Then why go there?

301
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,200
Because...he must.

302
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,000
Coming.

303
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,500
Yes, dear?

304
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
You get the presents,
I'll get the lights.

305
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,000
You bet.

306
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,300
Happy birthday to you

307
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,100
And many more

308
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,000
Thanks, Mom. Thank you, Dad.

309
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
-Blow out the candles.
-Make a wish.

310
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,200
Here.

311
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Oh, boy! A jacket!

312
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
Your mom made that
all by herself.

313
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,000
No kidding?

314
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,400
Who else could have done it?

315
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,100
I made these.

316
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,100
Holy cow.

317
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,100
What the heck are these?

318
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,800
It's your roller skates. Yup.

319
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,600
I redesigned them.

320
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,600
These are really swell.
I mean swell.

321
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,600
What did you wish for, son?

322
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,800
If he tells,
it won't come true.

323
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,900
Oh, that's a bunch of baloney.
My family never believed that.

324
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,700
Well, we did in my family.

325
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,700
I wished that I could
meet a girl.

326
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,300
I hope a nice one?

327
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,700
Yes, ma'am.

328
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,600
One that doesn't
glow in the dark, I hope.

329
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,300
Calvin Webber,
what a thing to say.

330

Well, we'll be going up
in two years.

We'll know then.

I'm gonna miss this place.

it seems to be OK.

Well, it's archaic French.

361
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,700
It's a 16th century
colloquialism...

meaning roughly "Good."

while I was up there and all...

477
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,400
I was thinking,
well, you know...

478
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,100
I was wondering
if maybe I could...

479
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,700
meet a girl.

I've been thinking about that
a little.

comes from Pasadena.

Nothing against valley girls,
but in my day anyhow...

486
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,100

seemed a little bit nicer.

487
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,000
Oh, and, son, there's also
something called a liquor store.

488
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,200
Write that down.

00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,700
Poison gas.

495
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,800
Invisible.

496
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,300
Don't forget.

497
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,200
I promise. Is that all?

498
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,500
One more thing.

499
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,200
If you find
a healthy young woman...

500
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,600
bring her on down.

501
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,400
Yes, sir.

502
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,500
Are you all right?

503
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,400
O Lord, yes.

504
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,300
Are you the one
who came last night...

505
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,100
all in yellow?

506
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,300
Oh, that was my father.

507
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,200
Oh! Of course. The father.

508
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,600
Forgive me.

509
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Can you forgive me
for my wasted life?

510
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
Everything has been so awful.

511
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,700
I know. It has been terrible...

512
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,300
but it's not your fault.

513
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,000
And now that
all the decay is over with...

514
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,700
things are going to get better.

515
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,200
You understand?

516
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,600
Well, I have to go now.

517
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,700
Of course! Of course you do.

518
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,400
I'll stay here and pray.

519
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
Say, that's always a good idea.

520
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,200
How do I leave this place?

521
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,500
The front door is open.

522
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,800
Will you be back?

523
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,000
I promise.

524
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,400
What?

525
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,600
What is it?

526
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,700
The sky.

527
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,500
The sky? Where?

528
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,700
Up there.

529
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,000
I don't see anything.

530
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,200
Just look!

531
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,500
What is it?

532
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,600
He says he sees something.

533
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,600
What is it?

534
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,100
I see it, Mommy!

535
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,600
I have never in my life
seen anything like it before.

536
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,600
Or like you.

537
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,500
What are you lookin' at?

538
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,000
Oh, my lucky stars, a Negro.

539
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,200
Say what?

540
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,600
How do you do, ma'am?

541
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,300
I do all right.

542
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,600
Good.

543
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,800
What is it?

544
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,000
What do you see?

545
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,600
We were just looking at the--

546
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,100
-Oh, no!
-What?

547
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Poisonous gas!
Run for your life!

548
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,000
Run! Run for your life!
lnvisible poisonous gas!

549
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,300
You know--

550
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,500
I just want to say...

551
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,400
I think he's going to be fine.

552
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,900
Thank you, Calvin.

553
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,400
Thank you very much.

554
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,900
He's smart.

555
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,300
Yes, dear, I know...

556
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,500
but he's still such a baby.

557
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,400
He's a man.

558
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,200
Oh, he's a baby man.

559
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,700
I tried to give
the driver this...

560
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,200
but he wouldn't take it.

561
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,300
He seems kind of angry.

562
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,100
A lot of people do.

563
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,600
Oh, boy. Here we go.

564
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,000
Hold on, everyone! Hold on!

565
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,400
Wow!

566
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,600
So this is
public transportation.

567
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
My father says it becomes
more and more important...

568
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,100
because of pollution,
which is more and more...

569
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,100
carbon dioxide and other
hazardous gases in the air.

570
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,600
Do you have a gun, by the way?

571
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,800
Oh. Well, thank you
for not waving it around.

572
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,600
And for not vomiting,
for that matter.

573
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,300
Say, do you know where
I could find a grocery store?

574
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,100
I have to find that.
That and a hardware store...

575
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,100
a liquor store,
and a standing Holiday lnn.

576
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,100
There's a grocery store
up the street.

577
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,300
-Where?
-Up there!

578
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,000
Oh. Thank you. Driver,
please stop the bus immediately!

579
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,300
I wish to get off!

580
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,700
Please stop the bus, sir!

581
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,100
-Paper or plastic?
-Paper, please.

582
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,300
Do you have a club card?

583
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,500
I need a price check
on register four...

584
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,900
Diet Dr. Pepper, six-pack.

585
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,700
Don't talk to strangers.

586
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,300
Manager to the front for
check approval, register one.

587
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,500
Can I help you?

588
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,000
Oh, yes. I'd like to get
some all-beef patties.

589
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,200
Fresh or frozen?

590
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,100
Come on. Frozen.

591
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,600
How much are they?

592
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,600
Frozen? Six-thirty a dozen
in a three-pound box.

593
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
Twelve into nine hundred
is seventy-five.

594
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,600
That's almost five hundred
dollars just for the hamburger.

595
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,200
My mother only gave me three
thousand dollars for everything.

596
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,200
The yacht batteries,
the pipe tobacco...

597
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
the diesel oil, the bleach...

598
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,700
the floss,
the birthday candles--

599
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,200
You could get a meat order
that big delivered to your home.

600
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,600
Really?

601
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,900
Sure.

602
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,900
Oh, that's terrific.

603
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,900
Except it just occurred to me
that I don't know where home is.

604
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,400
I'm lost.

605
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,600
Do you know where I live?

606
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,000
Will you please excuse me?

607
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,300
Gladly.

608
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,300
Thank you.

609
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Driver, please stop the bus!

610
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,700
The name's Adam Webber...

611
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,300
and I see that you buy
baseball cards.

612
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,200
Although these are a lot older
than the ones in the window...

613
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,300
I was hoping that you still
might be interested.

614
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,300
How much you want for this
Mickey Mantle rookie season?

615
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,500
Well, I was hoping
to sell all of the cards.

616
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,900
Really? No kidding?

617
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,400
All I have
are hundred-dollar bills...

618
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,000
and I need something smaller.

619
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,700
Ones, tens, fives.

620
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,200
I see what you mean.
Tell you what.

621
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,700
How about I give you
five hundred in small bills...

622
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,000
for the whole box?

623
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,900
That would be wonderful.

624
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,400
Aw, shit.

625
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,000
I'm working here, Evie-poo.
Don't screw me up.

626
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,500
Yeah, I can see you're working,
all right.

627
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,100
Bon soir, mademoiselle.

628
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,700
Oh, you're French?

629
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,400
I'm from out of town.

630
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,600
I'm here on business.

631
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,700
Well, your business must not be
sports memorabilia...

632
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,900
because this one
Mantle card right here--

633
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,500
worth six thousand dollars
all by its itty-bitty self.

634
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,100
Get out of here!

635
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,600
No, you get out of here.

636
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,400
Terrific. You're fired.

637
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,100
-I quit.
-No, no, no. I fired you.

638
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,800
Just like the hair salon guy
and the Chevy dealer.

639
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,700
You know why you can't keep
a goddamn job?

640
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,400
'Cause you can't keep
your goddamn mouth shut!

641
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,900
Excuse me, sir,
but I'd really appreciate it...

642
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,300
if you wouldn't take
the Lord's name in vain again.

643
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
You got a problem with that,
partner?

644
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,100
Yes.
I have a big problem with that.

645
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,900
Come on, Heathcliff.
I'll walk you out.

646
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,100
Yes, ma'am, but my name's Adam.

647
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,200
Adam and Eve, the perfect match.

648
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,500
I hope the two of you
will be very happy together.

649
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,200
Mazel-fucking-tov.

650
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,100
And don't come back, neither,
miss big shot.

651
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,300
I'm serious this time.

652
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,000
You're finished
in the hobby business.

653
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,200
Where are we going?

654
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,100
We? I'm going home.
Judging by that coat...

655
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,000
you have to get back
to the barber college.

656
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,600
No. I'm lost.

657
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,700
You're lost?

658
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,900
Did you just lose your job
back there because of me?

659
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,600
Forget it. I'm sick of working
for that dickhead.

660
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,700
Dickhead?

661
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,900
A walking penis
capable of intelligent speech.

662
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,400
A dickhead.

663
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,900
What is wrong with you?

664
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,600
I just had
this mental picture--

665
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,900
Help me pick these up.

666
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Oh, thank you.

667
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,000
Where are you parked?

668
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,800
I came on a bus.

669
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,400
Why does that not surprise me?

670
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,400
Don't know.
Why doesn't it surprise you?

671
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,300
Well, I guess because
I'm a little psychic.

672
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,600
I have this thing.

673
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,600
Oh, that's nice.

674
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,100
Yeah. Let me guess.

675
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,400
This is your first visit
to la-la land.

676
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,100
You're staying in Hollywood,
because like an idiot...

677
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,000
you thought that would be
an exciting place to stay.

678
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
-Am I right so far?
-So far.

679
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
-Yes, I'm right?
-Right.

680
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,300
I knew it.

681
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,200
So you get on a bus
and before you know it...

682
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,300
you're stuck in the San Fernando
Valley without a clue...

683
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,100
which brings us to here.
Correct again?

684
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,300
Again.

685
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,200
Where are you staying?

686
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,600
The Holiday lnn.

687
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,400
That's exactly right.

688
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,400
See? I'm psychic.
Not completely, but pretty much.

689
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,800
Pretty good, huh?

690
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,700
No, it was amazing.

691
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,100
I know. Thanks. I'm gonna
predict a bus for you.

692
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,200
-You go down here--
-Do you own a car?

693
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,500
Oh, no, sweetie.

694
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,300
Rule number one
in North America.

695
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,200
No strangers in the car.

696
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,700
If it'll make you feel
any better...

697
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,200
I don't have a gun.

698
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,300
Oh. Well,
that changes everything.

699
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,600
Get away from me!

700
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,600
I said something wrong.
Please forgive me.

701
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,000
-Get away from me!
-I'll make you a deal!

702
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,200
I will give you a Rogers Hornsby
if you take me to the hotel!

703
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,100
Rogers Hornsby?

704
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,700
He's yours.
I was holding him back.

705
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,900
Rogers Hornsby's worth
four thousand dollars.

706
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,700
So what? I got two of them !

707
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,900
And this many
Larry "Yogi" Berras...

708
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,700
and...

709
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,100
For four thousand dollars,
all I have to do...

710
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,300
is drive you to your hotel?

711
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,100
-Uh-huh.
-That's it?

712
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,100
I don't have to take
a physical on your spaceship?

713
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,400
No, ma'am.

714
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,100
What?

715
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,100
So, Mr. Andretti,
first time on the freeway?

716
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,500
It's Webber. Adam Webber.

717
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,500
Mind if I change the station?
Better traffic reports on A.M.

718
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,500
Sure. Wait!

719
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,700
What? What is it?

720
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,600
Go back. You had him.
It's Perry.

721
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,100
Perry Como.

722
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,100
You had him. Go back.

723
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:52,900
OK. Just--

724
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,900
-That's it.
-There.

725
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,100
I could die right now.

726
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,400
Over this?

727
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,600
Listen to this part.

728
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,300
This is where it really
takes off.

729
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,300
Wait for it. There!

730
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,300
You are one scary
son of a gun.

731
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,800
You better slow down.

732
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,900
I can't help it. Perry Como
always does this to me.

733
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,300
I just get so cranked.

734
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,400
Card, please. End of service.

735
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,900
That was wonderful.

736
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,500
I've never felt anything
like that before in my life.

737
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,400
Yeah, same here.
Don't forget your suitcase.

738
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,200
Thanks. You know--

739
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,700
I would like to stay
at this hotel.

740
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,700
Fill this out, please,
and I'll need to see a card.

741
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,200
A card?

742
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,800
Yes, sir.

743
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,800
Oh. Of course.

744
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,700
OK, then.

745
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,000
Bathroom's there...

746
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
TV's there--remote is on top.

747
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,000
Room service menu on the table.

748
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,500
Wow.

749
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,100
Oh, you dial nine to get out.

750
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,100
Of what?

751
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,300
The hotel.

752
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,100
I see.

753
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,500
Thank you.
You've been very, very helpful.

754
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,800
I managed to get some change
downstairs...

755
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,500
and my father taught me
in situations like this...

756
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,200
it's customary to give a tip.

757
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,700
Your father's a smart guy.

758
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,100
My father's a genius.

759
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,800
All right, here's your key,
and good night, sir.

760
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,500
Good night. Sleep tight.

761
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,600
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
That's what my mom always says.

762
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,500
Who I'm really beginning
to miss, by the way.

763
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:45,000
Sorry. It's my first night
away from home.

764
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,400
How old are you?

765
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,300
Thirty-five.

766
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,300
You don't look thirty-five.

767
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,900
How old do I look?

768
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,700
Oh, twenty-five, around there.

769
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,400
I guess living up here
makes people look older.

770
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Up here
on the eighteenth floor?

771
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,900
Yes, up here
on the eighteenth floor.

772
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,500
Good night.

773
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,800
What the hell am I doing here?

774
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,400
That's what I'd like to know.
Somebody tell me that.

775
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,500
Natural oils, tropical fruits...

776
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,500
flora, nuts,
and protective sunscreens...

777
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,100
a complete sun-care line...

778
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,400
Hi. This is the woman
from the baseball card store.

779
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,600
Remember me?

780
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,300
Hot-diggety-dog!

781
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,000
Thanks for calling me
on the telephone.

782
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,200
I'm so glad to see you.

783
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,400
I thought
I'd never see you again.

784
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,300
OK, down, boy.

785
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,400
Listen, I can't take this
for driving you home.

786
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,500
I wish I could, but I can't,
so, here, take it back.

787
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,200
I would have left it
at the front desk...

788
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,500
but it's very valuable.
Take it.

789
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,100
I can't take that. It's yours.

790
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,600
Take it, damn it!

791
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,600
Why are you doing that?

792
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,300
Because I haven't brushed yet.

793
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,700
Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.

794
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,500
Wait. Eve, please wait.

795
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,300
Please, do not follow me.
Don't do it.

796
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,200
I knew this would happen.
You're like a lost puppy.

797
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,400
Can't you talk to me
for just one little second?

798
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,600
Damn, I should have
taken the money and run.

799
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,300
That's what Troy told me to do,
but did I listen? No.

800
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,100
Will you put your hand down?

801
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,900
Who's Troy? Is he your husband?

802
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,800
Or a boyfriend?

803
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,300
Thank you!

804
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,000
Stop that! Don't do that!

805
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:10,000
Listen, I know you like me, OK?
I can tell.

806
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,200
But, you know what?
A lot of guys like me.

807
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,100
Not me exactly. It's my legs
or my butt or my hair...

808
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,400
or some combination
of the above.

809
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,400
I think it's the eyes.

810
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,800
The eyes?

811
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,200
Great. An eye man.
Anyhow, it never works out.

812
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,600
OK? Not that you even
need to know that.

813
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,200
You look like crap.
What have you been doing?

814
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:33,000
Watching television in color.

815
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,300
In color? No kidding.

816
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,800
Cross my heart and hope to die.

817
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,600
Yeah. See ya.

818
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,800
Why doesn't it ever work out?

819
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,900
What?

820
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,800
Why doesn't it ever work out,
you and men?

821
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,800
Why? Who the hell knows?

822
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,400
If you promise to leave me
alone, I'll tell you why.

823
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,400
It never works out...

824
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,400
because I am into legs
and hair and butts myself.

825
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,200
So I wind up with guys
who are very good-looking...

826
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,100
but even more shallow than I am,
if you can picture that.

827
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,600
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go find...

828
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,100
another low-paying,
demeaning job...

829
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,200
where some guy named Jerry
keeps telling me...

830
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,900
how lousy his marriage is.

831
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,200
-Why not go to work for me?
-Doing what?

832
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,800
Helping me sell
all my baseball cards...

833
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,000
and buying enough
food and supplies...

834
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,100
to fill several large trucks.

835
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,800
Food and supplies?

836
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,300
Who for, starving people?

837
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,900
They're not starving yet,
but they do need help.

838
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,600
How long would you need me for?

839
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,200
Two weeks.

840
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,400
What's the pay?

841
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,800
What's fair?

842
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:32,200
I gotta make at least
a thousand dollars a week.

843
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,500
You got it.

844
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,200
-Wait here while I get changed.
-Sure.

845
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,300
Here you go.

846
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,800
Why would someone need...

847
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:59,400
twenty-six yacht batteries?

848
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,000
I don't know.
I just work for the guy.

849
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,300
And who does he work for,
the CIA?

850
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,000
Pipe tobacco.

851
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,100
I'm going to need all of this.

852
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,600
Toilet paper.

853
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:16,900
Is there a sale?

854
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,300
Well, another day,
another dollar.

855
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,100
Will you stop staring at me?

856
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,300
Sorry.

857
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,600
I'll pick you up
at 8:00 in the morning.

858
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,000
You know, Eve, I was thinking--

859
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,200
Good night.

860
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,500
We'll need to rent
a refrigerated truck...

861
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,500
for the beef and poultry.

862
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,500
Well, it's your life.

863
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,500
And by the way, it's a dandy.

864
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,700
Think we're also going to have
to get another locker.

865
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,800
It's no problem. We'll just
sell another baseball card.

866
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,700
Coming down.

867
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,000
You know, Eve...

868
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,900
And--and don't get mad,
OK, but...

869
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,100
I would just be lost
without you.

870
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,700
Thanks.

871
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,300
And I guess...

872
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,700
I guess that...

873
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,900
I think that you and l--

874
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,900
Adam,
don't even think about it, OK?

875
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,400
I'm sorry.
I know that sounds mean...

876
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,900
but it would be a lot meaner
if I didn't say it, OK?

877
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,500
Let's take this truck back,
and I'm hungry.

878
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,700
Are you getting in?

879
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,900
There's something else
I'd like you to help me with.

880
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,100
Name it.

881
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,900
I'm afraid this is going
to sound a little bit crazy.

882
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,900
I'm sure it will.

883
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,100
Then forget it.

884
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,900
No, no. I'm sorry.

885
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,100
What is it?

886
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,300
Eve,
I want you to help me find...

887
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,200
a wife.

888
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,800
-A wife?
-Yes.

889
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,000
What for?

890
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Because I want to get married.

891
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,800
Why?

892
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,500
Because I don't want
to be alone.

893
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,500
Well, you can be single
and not alone.

894
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,000
Marriage bites.

895
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,300
-Bites what?
-The big one.

896
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,700
It does?

897
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,800
Sure.

898
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,000
Oh. I didn't know that.

899
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,800
Everybody knows that.

900
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,500
I mean,
ask my divorced brothers...

901
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,500
or my divorced mom and dad.

902
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,600
Everybody knows that.

903
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,000
They're all divorced?

904
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Everybody's divorced.

905
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,700
What kind of wife
you looking for?

906
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,500
Oh, um, well...

907
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,100
one who's not a mutant.

908
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,300
No dogs, huh?

909
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,000
OK. Cool.

910
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,800
And if it's possible...

911
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,200
I'd like to marry
someone from Pasadena.

912
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,200
Um, when do you need her by?

913
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,200
Two weeks?

914
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,000
Well, I can probably
get you laid in two weeks...

915
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
but to locate a non-mutant wife
from Pasadena...

916
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,300
will take some time.

917
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,200
That's what I was afraid of.

918
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,700
What do you mean,
you can get me laid?

919
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,700
Uh, can we talk about that
a little later?

920
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,400
-Of course.
-Great.

921
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,800
Lord, bless this food
we are about to receive...

922
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,700
and make us ever mindful
of the needs of others.

923
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,200
And bless my mom...

924
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,300
and bless my dad...

925
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,400
and bless my new friend Eve.

926
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,800
Amen.

927
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,600
Get out.

928
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,000
-The engine is still running.
-Now! Get out!

929
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,100
Yes, ma'am.

930
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,700
-Stop the "Ma'am" crap.
-Sorry.

931
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,900
You almost got us killed.

932
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,700
I told you,
I've never driven before.

933
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,300
Well, never drive again.

934
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,400
You said it would be easy.

935
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,000
Well, I was wrong!

936
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,000
-Say, is this your house?
-Yes.

937
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,100
I like it.

938
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,100
What are you
bitching about now?

939
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,100
What are you doing here?

940
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,800
I forgot some of my stuff.

941
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,800
-Your stuff?
-Yeah.

942
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,100
Let me see that.

943
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Oh, you came back
for your underwear.

944
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,100
Excuse me.
These are Ralph Laurens.

945
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,400
How'd you get in?

946
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,000
Thanks.

947
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,300
And who's this
interesting looking fellow?

948
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,400
This is Adam.

949
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,000
Adam, this is Cliff.

950
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,700
How do you do?

951
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,200
I do fine, Adam.

952
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,600
How about yourself?
You, uh...

953
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,300
doing any good lately?

954
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,800
Go home, Cliff,
wherever that might be.

955
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,400
Sheena Gilroy's apartment.

956
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,900
You remember her. She's
the model who went to Harvard.

957
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,300
Well, I'd better be going.

958
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,600
Bye, Adam.

959
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,700
-Nice coat.
-Thank you, Cliff.

960
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,200
It was very nice to meet you.

961
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,900
That's a nice parking job, too.

962
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,300
May I ask you a question?

963
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,500
He's a former boyfriend.

964
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,000
We lived together
for about six months...

965
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,400
and, yes, I still have
sort of a thing for him.

966
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,700
That's what you wanted to know,
isn't it?

967
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,400
No. I was going to ask you...

968
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,100
why Cliff likes to wear
another man's underpants.

969
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,300
What?

970
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,900
This guy is unbelievable.

971
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,100
I knew you'd like him.

972
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,400
I know. It's like he's from
"X Files" or something.

973
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,600
He's got all these easily
negotiable properties, right?

974
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,000
And he's obviously
setting up something big--

975
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,900
maybe a self-sustaining island
off the coast of South America.

976
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,000
Or maybe he's the leader
of some cult...

977
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:37,500
that's into practices involving
poultry and pipe tobacco.

978
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,200
You have very nice ceilings.

979
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,900
-Do l?
-Mm-hmm.

980
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,800
Well...

981
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,600
you like ceilings?

982
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:53,900
Not particularly.

983
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,500
Ah. Well, I hope you like this.

984
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,200
It's fresh sea urchin
wrapped in seaweed.

985
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,400
I love sushi.

986
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,500
I love Lucy.

987
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,300
Who doesn't? She's hilarious.

988
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,500
Here you go--
one champagne cocktail.

989
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,700
Oh, thank you.

990
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,700
I thought only hookers
drank those things.

991
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,300
Well, I know Mom
sure likes them.

992
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,300
Well, dinner's in fifteen.
Why don't we sit down and chat?

993
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,600
So, Troy, what do you do
for a living?

994
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,600
Oh, I design web sites.

995
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,400
And, Adam...

996
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,000
where on Earth are you from?

997
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,500
Out of town.
That's all he'll say.

998
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,500
It's a very small place.

999
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,200
People don't even know
it's there.

1000
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,400
And it's called?

1001
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,800
Maybe Eve can guess.

1002
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,000
She's psychic.

1003
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,600
Is she?

1004
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,800
Since when?

1005
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,300
Since I got rear-ended
in Palm Springs.

1006
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,600
Well, then,
Miss Dionne Warwick...

1007
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,200
why don't you tell us
what town he's from?

1008
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,200
All right. Give me your hand.

1009
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,300
Oh, Lord.

1010
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,300
I'm not promising anything.

1011
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,600
-Are you OK?
-Mm-hmm.

1012
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,900
I see snow--

1013
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,200
Iots of snow...

1014
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,900
way up north.

1015
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,100
Are we getting hot?

1016
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,100
Yes...

1017
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,900
You live in Alaska...

1018
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,800
and the only way in and out
of your place is by plane.

1019
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
And you definitely came here
for food and supplies...

1020
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,500
and to find a wife.

1021
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,300
That was right?

1022
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,300
Got goosebumps all over me.

1023
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,100
I'm clairvoyant, butthead.

1024
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,600
Why wouldn't you just go
to Nome...

1025
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,000
to get supplies and a wife?

1026
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,400
Isn't that a lot closer?

1027
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,600
Yeah, right. That's where
you'd go to find girls--

1028
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,100
Nome.

1029
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,700
He's gay, by the way.

1030
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,700
Well, good for you.

1031
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Well, we try.

1032
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:03,600
Can I ask you some questions?

1033
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,500
When did Alaska become a state?

1034
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,700
1959.

1035
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,200
And who owned it before we did?

1036
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,700
Russia.

1037
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,200
And when did we get it
from them?

1038
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,100
1867--Seward's folly.

1039
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:19,100
We purchased it for seven
point two million dollars--

1040
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,900
a tidy sum then as well as now.

1041
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,800
I'm quoting my father,
of course.

1042
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,600
All right,
what's the state capital?

1043
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,800
Juneau.

1044
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,200
Hello? It's Anchorage. Gotcha.

1045
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,400
Sorry. That's the largest city.

1046
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:38,900
Where's he going?

1047
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,600
He's going to check
your answers on his computer.

1048
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,100
He has a computer?

1049
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,200
-Sure.
-In the house?

1050
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,300
No, actually,
it's in the backyard.

1051
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,200
Of course it's in the house.
It's in there.

1052
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,300
May I be excused, please?

1053
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,400
Thank you.

1054
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,300
Who are you?

1055
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,400
I'm the mother.

1056
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,000
It's the mother!

1057
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,200
Troy, I suppose
those tall buildings...

1058
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,000
we saw this morning are new?

1059
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,500
Yeah.
Almost all of them, anyway.

1060
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,100
The recovery's impressive.

1061
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,300
Recovery?

1062
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:22,000
Oh, yeah. They rebuilt
the freeway in only six months.

1063
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,800
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

1064
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,900
That's amazing.
I'm very impressed.

1065
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
-Oh, well, that's impressive.
-Are you sure I look OK?

1066
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:30,000
Oh, trust me, you look fabulous.

1067
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,200
Thank you, Troy.

1068
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,800
So, what do you think?

1069
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,000
It works.

1070
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Maybe I should show you
the entire trousseau--

1071
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,100
shirts, sweaters, socks,
the whole thing.

1072
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,700
No. First, let's show her these.

1073
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,300
Eve, can I skate
around your block?

1074
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,800
How about it, Eve?

1075
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,800
Can he skate around your block?

1076
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,100
Just a few laps.

1077
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,300
It won't take long.

1078
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,000
Look.

1079
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:37,200
Adam, will you go skate
on the bike path?

1080
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,700
-Where?
-The bike path. It's over there.

1081
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,400
God, I wish I could wear
those pants.

1082
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:46,000
All right, girl, hit that ball.

1083
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,000
I get it.

1084
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I finally get it.

1085
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,900
You have to see it
to understand it.

1086
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,500
Because he must.

1087
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,300
Haven't you ever heard
the saying...

1088
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,800
"He hasn't got enough sense
to come in out of the rain"?

1089
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,200
You know...

1090
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:28,500
my father, who is a scientist...

1091
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,100
says that everything
is a miracle.

1092
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:33,400
Everything.

1093
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,600
Until recently, I wasn't sure
what he meant by that.

1094
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,200
No kidding. Listen...

1095
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:40,200
you still want to go
girl hunting tonight?

1096
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,600
Oh, yes, I certainly do.

1097
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:45,300
But, I mean, you know...

1098
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,700
this whole business
of finding you a wife...

1099
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,300
it's pretty ridiculous,
don't you think?

1100
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,400
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is.

1101
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,700
A girlfriend, maybe,
but a wife, it's...

1102
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,300
Well, then help me
find a girlfriend.

1103
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:56,700
That's all I ask.

1104
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,000
I'll tell you what. I'll give
you every single card I've got.

1105
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:02,700
Screw you. You think I'm just
somebody you can buy off?

1106
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,100
I didn't mean that at all.

1107
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,100
Eve, you're my best friend.

1108
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,900
Would you do it because
you're my very best friend?

1109
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,000
Thank you, Eve.

1110
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,300
Well, why did we park
way back there?

1111
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,700
She doesn't allow total
strangers to drive her car.

1112
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,700
-What?
-Ladies first, Troy.

1113
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,500
-That was close.
-Uh-huh.

1114
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,800
My goodness gracious,
this place is something.

1115
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:47,100
Look unimpressed.

1116
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,600
Yeah, bored, even.

1117
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:53,000
Try vaguely bored.

1118
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,400
Unimpressed,
but still interested.

1119
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,700
Not crazy.

1120
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,200
-Do I look crazy?
-Yes.

1121
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,700
Just, uh, be loose.

1122
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,000
-Just be yourself.
-That's always good advice.

1123
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,600
Well, for him. It doesn't work
with the rest of us.

1124
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:16,400
Of all the clubs in all
the towns in all the world...

1125
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,800
you walk into mine.

1126
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:19,700
So welcome to Club 40's...

1127
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:22,200
where the party never stops.

1128
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,400
Ah, Jason, Jonathan...

1129
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,100
this is Adam.
Adam, that's them.

1130
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,500
Hi. How do you do?

1131
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,900
It's very nice to meet you,
Jason and Jonathan.

1132
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:31,100
My mother always said...

1133
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,800
that when you meet someone
for the first time...

1134
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,900
it's always easier
to remember their names...

1135
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,200
if you use those names
right away, Jason and Jonathan.

1136
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,100
He's from Alaska.

1137
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,400
Hi there, Eve.

1138
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,700
Who's the hunk?

1139
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,100
Get lost, Sophie.

1140
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,700
Hi. I'm Sophie.

1141
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:51,500
Hi. How do you do?
I'm Adam Webber.

1142
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,800
Adam lives in Alaska.

1143
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:54,100
No shit?

1144
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:56,700
-Vous parlez franais?
-Oui.

1145
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:58,300
Moi, je parle un peu franais.

1146
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,100
Oh, you speak beautiful French.

1147
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,000
J'ai habite  paris un an.

1148
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,700
Paris--
c'est la vie des lumieres...

1149
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,100
-n'est-ce pas?
-Oui.

1150
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,600
-C'est le pays d'amour.
-Bien sur.

1151
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,100
C'est bien que
je vous aie rencontree...

1152
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,100
parce que je n'ai pas
eu la chance de pratiquer.

1153
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,800
Si tu veux,
nous pouvons pratiquer...

1154
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,500
beaucoup de choses ensemble.

1155
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,300
Tais-toi.

1156
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:22,000
Au revoir.

1157
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,300
Je m'appelle Adam Webber.

1158
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:26,400
Quit showing off.
We're here on business.

1159
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,800
I thought we were here
to meet women.

1160
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,800
-Not that one.
-I like her.

1161
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,400
Now, Sophie,
when you fly to Paris...

1162
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,500
do you check these,
or are they carry-on?

1163
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,900
They're carry-on.

1164
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,800
Excuse me.

1165
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:49,400
What are you drinking?

1166
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,900
Oh, this is a Rob Roy.

1167
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,500
It's a very popular drink
I'm told.

1168
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,100
How about her?

1169
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,200
No way.

1170
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,800
Why not? l--I think
she's very attractive.

1171
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:05,700
She's got "bitch"
written all over her.

1172
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:09,100
You do know what "bitch" means,
don't you?

1173
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:11,100
Well, yes, I do.
I do have a dictionary...

1174
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,800
but I can't understand
for the life of me...

1175
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,800
why you would say that
about her...

1176
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,100
or why Cliff would say that
about you.

1177
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I think for you
we should aim for...

1178
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,500
sweet.

1179
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,800
OK. I like that.

1180
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,400
Yeah, sweet.

1181
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,400
That's a lovely way
of putting it.

1182
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,100
There's Miss Sweet over there
by the hors d'oeuvres table.

1183
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,500
Look.

1184
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,500
Oh, yeah, yeah. Could be.

1185
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:41,100
Yeah, go on, Romeo. Say hello.

1186
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,000
She looks
like a non-mutant to me.

1187
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,500
OK. All right.

1188
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,600
What do I say to her?

1189
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:49,300
Oh, say something surprising...

1190
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,600
something funny--

1191
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,100
Lie, if need be.

1192
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,500
-Lie?
-Oh, yeah.

1193
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:58,000
Lying can be
a very effective dating tool.

1194
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,800
All right.

1195
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,200
Here I go.

1196
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,300
I don't think
I want to watch this.

1197
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,300
Surprising and funny.

1198
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,400
Well, I know "the duck
who bought some lip balm."

1199
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,100
Lie.

1200
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,700
I was wondering
if you could help me.

1201
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,700
I, um, seem to have lost...

1202
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,300
my Congressional Medal
of Honor...

1203
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:30,100
around here somewhere.

1204
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:33,800
Now, that's a great one.

1205
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:38,700
This is my new friend.

1206
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,500
Hi. I'm Heather.

1207
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:47,700
I don't believe I've ever
heard that name before.

1208
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,500
Yeah, do you dance?

1209
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,600
Why, I took a dance lesson
every day of my life...

1210
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,700
up until a couple of days ago.

1211
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,700
-You're kidding.
-No, no, I did.

1212
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,800
Shall we dance?

1213
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,100
-Sure.
-Yeah?

1214
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,500
Wait for me.

1215
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,100
Is that your girlfriend?

1216
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,700
No, no.
Will you please excuse me?

1217
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,500
You -- you go to the bathroom.

1218
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:28,700
What, right here?

1219
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:32,300
I thought I should check.
You're being so bossy.

1220
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,700
Thank you both very much
for the dance.

1221
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:34,900
Thank you.

1222
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,500
I have to go to the bathroom.

1223
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:49,600
-You wanted to see me?
-You're not from Alaska.

1224
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,200
Where the hell did you learn
to dance like that?

1225
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:54,200
And there are
no starving people, are there?

1226
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,600
Why are you so angry with me?

1227
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,900
What, you think
I'm some kind of sap?

1228
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,700
No, I don't.

1229
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:00,800
I admire you.

1230
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,600
I fell in love with you
the very moment I saw you.

1231
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,500
I want you to stop lying to me.

1232
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,400
All right.

1233
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,600
I'll tell you everything.

1234
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,100
In 1962--

1235
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,100
Well, well, well.

1236
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,700
Don't we clean up nice?

1237
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:17,900
Well, hello, Cliff.

1238
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,200
How are you this evening?

1239
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:22,000
Not bad...

1240
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,800
though I do miss
that green sport coat of yours.

1241
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:26,200
Oh, why, thank you, Cliff...

1242
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,900
but that's my seat,
and I was just about--

1243
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:29,800
Come have a drink up at the bar.

1244
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,400
Sure.

1245
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,700
Excuse us.

1246
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,200
It's all yours.

1247
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:15,600
Please excuse this interruption.

1248
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:16,700
Oh, brother.

1249
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,400
Eve, I don't mean to be rude,
and, Cliff, please excuse me...

1250
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:22,500
but, Eve, isn't Cliff
just a butt with hair?

1251
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:23,700
What?

1252
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:27,100
I'm sorry. And legs--
Legs, butt, and hair.

1253
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,300
And shallow as well.

1254
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,500
Shallow?

1255
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,400
Adam, why don't you go home?

1256
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:32,700
Go back to the hotel.

1257
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,500
Yeah, before I kick your ass.

1258
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:38,800
I must warn you, Cliff,
I do know how to defend myself.

1259
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,500
Oh, do you?

1260
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,800
Stop it, you two.

1261
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,700
Nice move.

1262
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:47,200
Yeah, he's right. Maybe
we shouldn't fight in here.

1263
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,300
I agree.

1264
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,000
I'm sorry. He was going to...

1265
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:59,100
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all.
I mean...

1266
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:00,800
fighting's pretty immature
when you think about it.

1267
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,300
It certainly is.

1268
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,600
I'm leaving.

1269
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,000
That's probably a good idea.

1270
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,500
I'm sorry.

1271
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,400
Well...

1272
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:14,600
good night, everyone.

1273
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,400
I'm leaving, too, OK?

1274
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,600
And you know what?
lf you want help...

1275
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,500
you can ask Troy,
because I quit.

1276
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,100
This is ridiculous.

1277
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,900
You're ridiculous,
and I'm ridiculous.

1278
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,500
I'll buy you another
Rob Roy, huh, champ?

1279
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,300
Rob Roy for the gentleman.

1280
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:43,700
Well?

1281
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,200
He go back to the hotel?

1282
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,800
He might have.

1283
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:49,100
What does that mean?

1284
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,500
That means
that we did not leave together.

1285
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,100
Well, who did he leave with?

1286
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:56,100
-What's that to you?
-I'm his pimp!

1287
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
He left with those dancers,
didn't he?

1288
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:02,000
You're the psychic.

1289
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:04,100
Eve the psychic pimp.

1290
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,500
You tell me.

1291
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,400
Those sluts.

1292
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,600
Then again, who isn't a slut
these days, huh?

1293
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:14,000
Where are you going?

1294
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,400
-To bed.
-To bed?

1295
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,200
Sure. To bed.

1296
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,100
I'm not the one
that's in love with the guy.

1297
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:22,200
What?!

1298
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,500
Now hold on!

1299
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,500
Hold on just a minute.

1300
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,000
In the first place...

1301
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
I do not fall in love
with weirdoes...

1302
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:32,100
who I've only known
for four or five days.

1303
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,300
Yes, you do.

1304
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,000
And I don't fall in love
with grown men...

1305
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,500
who collect baseball cards!

1306
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:37,600
Yes, you do.

1307
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,200
Or pee in their pants
when they see the ocean.

1308
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:41,400
Yes, you do.

1309
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,200
Or have perfect table manners.

1310
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,700
You know,
I asked him about that.

1311
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,600
He said good manners...

1312
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,100
are just a way
of showing other people...

1313
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:50,600
that we have respect for them.

1314
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,900
I didn't know that. I thought
it was a way of acting superior.

1315
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:55,400
Oh, and you know
what else he told me?

1316
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,800
What?

1317
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:59,600
He thinks I'm a gentleman,
and you're a lady.

1318
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:05,100
Well, consider the source.

1319
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:07,700
I don't even know
what a lady is.

1320
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:10,700
I know. I thought a gentleman
was somebody that owned horses.

1321
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:12,200
But it turns out...

1322
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,700
the short, simple definition
of a lady or a gentleman...

1323
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,500
is someone who always tries
to make sure...

1324
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,200
that the people
around him or her...

1325
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:20,300
are as comfortable as possible.

1326
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,600
Where do you think
he got all that information?

1327
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,500
Oh, from the oddest place.

1328
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,400
His parents.

1329
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,900
I don't think
I got that memo from mine.

1330
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:33,200
And now, I suppose, he's trying
to make those dancers...

1331
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,700
feel as comfortable as possible.

1332
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,700
He didn't go home with them.

1333
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,400
Well...

1334
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,900
He went home with Sophie.

1335
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,200
She swept him out of the room...

1336
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:56,600
whispering little French
sweet-nothings into his ear.

1337
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:59,100
No, not Sophie. Not Sophie.
Don't tell me that.

1338
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:01,600
So whatcha gonna do, go to
her place and kick the door in?

1339
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,400
You're goddamn right I am.

1340
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,500
You coming?

1341
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,500
You kidding? Sophie'd kill me.

1342
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,100
Coward.

1343
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,700
Gentleman coward.

1344
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:36,200
So just scare me, why don't you,
you stupid son of a bitch!

1345
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,800
I'm really sorry.

1346
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,000
What are you doing here?

1347
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
You're supposed to be
on San Vicente Boulevard...

1348
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:44,700
having unsafe sex
with that slut Sophie.

1349
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:46,700
I know, and I'm really sorry.

1350
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:48,200
I'm limping!

1351
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,700
How attractive is that?!

1352
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,400
What if this is for life?

1353
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,400
-I--I was just gonna say--
-I know.

1354
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,900
-And then she--
-I know, I know.

1355
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
-And I didn't mean to scare her.
-Of course you didn't.

1356
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:02,700
Nothing I do with her
ever seems to be right.

1357
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,200
Used to be right up here
with the coffee.

1358
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,400
Why don't people
ever fucking...

1359
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:07,000
That's because...

1360
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,700
you're a nice boy...

1361
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:11,300
but what Eve needs
is a nice man.

1362
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,200
Understand, champ?

1363
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,400
Good night.

1364
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:16,700
Good night, Troy.

1365
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:19,000
You still here?

1366
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:21,100
-Let me help you.
-No. I can do it myself.

1367
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:23,300
I know more about first aid than
you know about baseball cards.

1368
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,300
Now give me the stuff
and sit down.

1369
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,400
Sit!

1370
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,400
Let me see.

1371
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,600
Give me your knee.

1372
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,200
These pants are ruined, right?

1373
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,400
I'd say so.

1374
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,600
There.

1375
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:45,200
Steady.

1376
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,400
Ouch!

1377
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,700
There.

1378
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:48,900
Don't be such a baby.

1379
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,900
Oh, I'm the baby?

1380
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:02,200
Did, um...

1381
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Did you go to Sophie's?

1382
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:08,800
Of course.

1383
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:11,400
And?

1384
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:14,000
She was hospitable.

1385
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,500
Hospitable?

1386
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,000
But...

1387
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
it just wasn't
where I wanted to be...

1388
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:27,200
so...

1389
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,500
I left as politely
as I could...

1390
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,500
and I found a taxi...

1391
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,200
and I told the driver
to bring me here...

1392
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,200
instead of back to the hotel.

1393
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:42,200
There's a song
that Mr. Como sings...

1394
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,000
called
"On the Street Where You Live."

1395
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:45,300
Do you know it?

1396
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:48,600
Sing it to me.

1397
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:55,900
I have often walked

1398
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:57,500
Down this street before

1399
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,600
But the pavement always stayed

1400
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,600
Beneath my feet before

1401
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:05,700
All at once am I

1402
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,300
Several stories high

1403
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:12,200
Knowing I'm on the street

1404
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,000
Where you live

1405
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
It's a song
about a young man...

1406
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,100
who's overjoyed...

1407
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:25,300
just to be standing
in front of the house...

1408
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:27,900
of the person...

1409
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,000
that he loves.

1410
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,200
You know, l--

1411
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:59,400
Adam, I know this is stupid...

1412
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,300
but humor me.

1413
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Have you ever had sex before?

1414
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,400
No...

1415
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,900
How is that possible?

1416
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,800
You better sit back down.

1417
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,600
In 1962, when the bomb
was dropped on Los Angeles...

1418
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,200
my parents
were in our fallout shelter.

1419
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,600
That's where I was born.

1420
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:34,700
We only survived because
it's a huge shelter...

1421
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:36,700
as far as fallout shelters go.

1422
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:41,000
My father worked on it secretly
for years.

1423
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,100
When he had to...

1424
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,700
he used contractors...

1425
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:45,200
but always from out of state...

1426
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,000
and always for only
a portion of the job.

1427
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:49,700
He told them it was a secret
government experiment...

1428
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:51,100
done through Cal Tech.

1429
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:52,700
Now, my dad's not a liar...

1430
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:55,700
but in this case,
he felt he had no choice.

1431
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:57,700
Of course,
it had to be kept a secret.

1432
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:59,100
We only had enough supplies...

1433
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:01,900
to last three people
for thirty-five years.

1434
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:04,600
The really tricky part
was the air-vent system...

1435
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:07,100
but we were able to cut into
the flood-control sewer.

1436
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:09,100
We...

1437
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,800
What I would like to do...

1438
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:18,600
is to take you with me
into the fallout shelter.

1439
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,500
We could live there
with my mom and dad.

1440
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:25,200
My dad said that if I found
a healthy young girl...

1441
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:28,200
that...that I should
bring her on down.

1442
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:29,800
Why, Eve...

1443
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,500
you look plenty healthy to me.

1444
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:46,200
I think it's time to call a cab.

1445
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,800
Oh. Of course.
You're absolutely right.

1446
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:53,300
I really shouldn't be over here
at this late hour.

1447
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:03,800
Good night, Adam.

1448
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,500
Thank you.

1449
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:31,200
God damn, Adam !

1450
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:32,500
Wait a minute.

1451
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,200
Oh, look, I'm sorry.

1452
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:39,200
I know. I took the Lord's
name in vain again. I--

1453
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:42,000
No. There's an adult bookstore
back there.

1454
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,700
I'll be right back.

1455
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,100
Give us a sign!

1456
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:00,200
-Amen!
-Yes!

1457
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,600
That's all we ask.

1458
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:04,800
Just give us some sort of sign!

1459
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:08,400
Just show us
that we're not alone!

1460
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,500
This is, uh...

1461
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:38,900
Hi, Adam. I'm Nina Aron.

1462
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:41,900
-Hello. How do you do?
-Very well, thank you.

1463
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,600
I'm with the County
Family Services Department.

1464
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:48,300
Eve tells me you've been
living in a bomb shelter...

1465
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:49,500
most of your life.

1466
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:52,100
Fallout shelter.

1467
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:54,100
There is a difference.

1468
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:57,700
Adam, I'd like to introduce you
to my associate Mr. Brown.

1469
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:03,900
We want you to come with us...

1470
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:05,900
so we can talk some more
about your experiences.

1471
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:07,200
Come where?

1472
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:09,000
My office.

1473
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:10,200
For how long?

1474
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:13,100
Well, that depends.

1475
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:15,500
Well, I thank you very much
for the invitation...

1476
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,200
but I'm very busy today.

1477
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:18,500
Perhaps
I could see you tomorrow.

1478
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:21,600
I think you should go
with Dr. Aron.

1479
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:24,300
I think it's the best thing.

1480
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:28,400
I think it's best for you.
I--I do.

1481
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:35,800
All right, Eve. If you say so.

1482
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:38,400
I do.

1483
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:43,200
Could I please just go home?

1484
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:45,700
I was lost,
but I found home this morning.

1485
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:48,100
And if I can just go home...

1486
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:50,100
I promise I'll never bother
any of you ever again.

1487
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:53,800
Let's go talk first.

1488
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Yes Ma'am.

1489
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:03,500
Bye Adam.

1490
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:07,300
Bye Troy.

1491
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:16,200
You'll be hearing from me.

1492
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:22,500
What?!

1493
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:24,200
What was I supposed to do?

1494
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:26,200
He told me he wanted
to take me underground.

1495
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:27,600
That's like
"Silence of the Lambs."

1496
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,100
It's crazy!

1497
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:32,700
Yeah. You did the right thing.

1498
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:40,100
Where you going?

1499
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,100
Oh, my God.

1500
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,400
All right, don't worry.
He'll catch him.

1501
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,000
Yes, this is Nina Aron.

1502
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,500
I've got a runaway, and I'm
going to need police assistance.

1503
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:52,500
-No, you cannot call them.
-Honey, I have to.

1504
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,900
If a complaint is made
and the person resists--

1505
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:56,300
No! I cannot have that!

1506
01:31:56,400 --> 01:32:00,200
They'll come with their cars
and their guns and--

1507
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:01,300
All right. Calm down.

1508
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:02,700
Now, that young man
needs help...

1509
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:04,400
and you need protection
from him.

1510
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,700
I was frightened!

1511
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:08,800
I didn't know what to think,
but, you know...

1512
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:10,300
I believe him.

1513
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:11,800
I think he just--

1514
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:14,600
I really think
he wants to go home--

1515
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:16,100
wherever that might be.

1516
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:17,700
Everybody has to calm down.

1517
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:19,200
That's the most important thing.

1518
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:22,200
You can have
all my baseball cards...

1519
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:23,400
and don't forget
to pay my bills.

1520
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,100
Young man, you stop right there!

1521
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:27,500
Stop! Don't get in that truck!

1522
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:30,000
You gotta stop trying
to drive this truck.

1523
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,100
Thanks for always being happy.

1524
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:35,100
-What?
-Gay.

1525
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:43,000
That's my car,
you son of a bitch!

1526
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:45,200
Where the hell have you been?

1527
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:46,400
I fell down.

1528
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,400
You guys get the license number
on that truck?

1529
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,500
What are you asking them for?
They're as screwed up as he is!

1530
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,900
Hey, everybody keep calm.
That's the important thing.

1531
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:55,700
Who you talking to,
you stupid...

1532
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:07,900
Mom, Dad...

1533
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:10,400
I'm home.

1534
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,800
I've got almost everything
we need.

1535
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:21,400
And this nice man...

1536
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:22,900
Archbishop Melker.

1537
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:24,400
We've met previously.

1538
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:25,900
...and his church group

1539
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,300
have volunteered
to help bring it down...

1540
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:28,800
but we've gotta hurry.

1541
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:30,500
Are you in trouble, son?

1542
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,500
I think I'm being chased
by a psychiatrist.

1543
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,000
A psychiatrist?

1544
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:35,200
It happens.

1545
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,700
Oh, my goodness.

1546
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,700
How bad is it up there?

1547
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Horrible.

1548
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,900
There's something
on your forehead.

1549
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:47,200
I know.

1550
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:25,600
Is this it?

1551
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:32,500
Well, what are we gonna do
with it?

1552
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,000
Give it back to him.

1553
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,700
And what if we can't find him?

1554
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:37,200
We'll find him.

1555
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:38,400
Well...

1556
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,900
Eve, look what I found
in the suitcase.

1557
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:06,400
It's stock certificates.

1558
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,000
I mean, it's got, like--

1559
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,800
It's got, like,
IBM and AT&T and Polaroid and...

1560
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:13,700
"Ipana"?

1561
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:15,700
I remember this brand.

1562
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:17,700
I didn't know
they still made this.

1563
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,800
Oh. Look at this.

1564
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:25,400
It says "Trademark 1961."

1565
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:32,200
Hurry, my friends!
We have no time to waste!

1566
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:33,600
The son has spoken!

1567
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,100
Let's step it up!

1568
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:39,200
Leave my elevator alone

1569
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:42,000
We're losing a ride!

1570
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Purchased in 1958 and '59...

1571
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:46,600
ten thousand shares of each?

1572
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:48,100
They'd be worth millions.

1573
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:49,200
Hell, I don't know.

1574
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:51,200
Millions upon millions...

1575
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:52,600
Upon millions.

1576
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,200
The stocks,
the baseball cards...

1577
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,900
the clothes...

1578
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:58,600
the toothpaste.

1579
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:01,000
The guy's on the level.

1580
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:06,100
Eve,
a man walks into your life...

1581
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:08,200
who's the kindest,
most polite...

1582
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,200
most incredibly rich guy
you've ever met.

1583
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:12,000
And I have him committed.

1584
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,700
Yes, you did.

1585
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,800
Well...

1586
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,800
at least I fell for him
before I found out he was rich.

1587
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,200
That's new.

1588
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:29,300
He said today
he knew where home was.

1589
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,000
Where'd you guys go
this morning?

1590
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:34,700
Just to pick up frozen poultry.

1591
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:35,800
Then?

1592
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:37,700
Then back to the house.

1593
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:39,200
You didn't stop anywhere?

1594
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,200
We did.
We stopped at a porn shop.

1595
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,700
Yeah, we stopped
at this adult bookstore.

1596
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,200
Adam was very excited to see it.

1597
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:51,200
Adam was very excited
to see porn?

1598
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:57,000
Eve, do you think
maybe his home is underneath...

1599
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:58,800
a dirty book store
in the valley?

1600
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:05,800
This is it?

1601
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:07,700
Yeah. Yeah, this is the place.

1602
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:35,200
Do you have a basement?

1603
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:39,500
Believe me, all the really
good stuff is right up front.

1604
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:43,200
Is there a back entrance
or something?

1605
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,200
Are you kidding? Of course.

1606
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:47,200
Nice kid. Nice kid.

1607
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:53,200
What are we looking for?
This is ridiculous.

1608
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:56,200
Why would they put a fallout
shelter under a porn shop?

1609
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:57,600
None of this was here
back in '62.

1610
01:37:57,700 --> 01:38:00,200
Back then this was all,
like, cute little homes...

1611
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:03,100
and, you know, fruit orchards.

1612
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:05,200
We've come a long way,
haven't we?

1613
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:08,800
I wanna go home.

1614
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,800
Yeah. Maybe he'll call, huh?

1615
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:15,700
This is Adam.

1616
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,100
Look, I just wanted to thank you
for everything you did for me.

1617
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:21,700
And...

1618
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:23,400
I wanted to tell you that l...

1619
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:26,200
that, uh...

1620
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:29,500
that I--that I wish
so many good things for you.

1621
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:33,200
I wish so hard that
all of your dreams come true.

1622
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,700
And...

1623
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:37,200
and that--
and that's all I...

1624
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,700
And that's all.

1625
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:06,300
Your ride stinks!

1626
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:12,500
Stay outta here, you drunk!

1627
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,900
Adam..?

1628
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:20,700
How long you gonna set it for
this time?

1629
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:22,600
I thought ten years.

1630
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:25,200
Well, it's...

1631
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:28,200
considerably shorter
than before, but...

1632
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:31,700
I was wondering, Calvin,
I mean...

1633
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:33,200
why set the locks at all?

1634
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:35,000
I mean, the radiation's gone.

1635
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:37,600
To keep what's up there
from getting down here.

1636
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:40,100
It's not radiation
I'm worried about.

1637
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:54,100
I would like for you to meet...

1638
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:55,900
Miss Eve Vrustikov.

1639
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,800
Adam's told me
such wonderful things about you.

1640
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:05,500
Oh, honey...

1641
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:07,200
excuse us, please.

1642
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,200
We haven't entertained
a guest...

1643
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:10,700
In quite some time.

1644
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:13,800
Oh, Eve, what--
what can I offer you?

1645
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:15,600
Mom, Eve and I have to go.

1646
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,300
Oh, Adam, you just got here.

1647
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:18,800
I can't explain right now...

1648
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,800
but I want you to set the locks
for two months.

1649
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,500
You've got more than enough
of everything...

1650
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:24,500
and then we'll be right back
to get you.

1651
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:26,100
But I don't understand.

1652
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:28,100
And I'm asking you
to trust me...

1653
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:29,500
without understanding why.

1654
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,200
In that case, of course.

1655
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:33,200
Oh, of course, son.

1656
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:35,700
They really are
wonderful parents.

1657
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:40,200
Oh, Adam, could you at least
stay for dinner?

1658
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:41,900
Well...she...

1659
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,100
You must.

1660
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,200
Perfect.

1661
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:49,300
Now tell me
if you heard this one.

1662
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,500
Duck walks into a drugstore.

1663
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:53,700
This gravy
is an old favorite of Calvin's.

1664
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:57,100
Now, Eve,
the platter's down here.

1665
01:41:57,100 --> 01:41:59,000
Would you get that, honey?

1666
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:02,200
The sperm swims toward the egg.

1667
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:04,300
Into the egg.

1668
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,700
-Why?
-Because it must.

1669
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:08,000
But why?

1670
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,700
Because it's out there.

1671
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,500
I don't mean to be nosy,
but are you and Adam dating?

1672
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:17,000
Yeah, we are.

1673
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:21,200
And I'm from Pasadena.

1674
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:28,200
And you thought
your parents were weird.

1675
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,300
It's truly amazing
what you can get done...

1676
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:33,700
when you have unlimited funds.

1677
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:36,400
Do you know you can have
whole houses built...

1678
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,400
in just a matter of months?

1679
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,700
It's like the Garden of Eden,
don't you think?

1680
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:42,300
All you have to say is this...

1681
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:43,900
"I don't care what it costs."

1682
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:45,100
And then, of course,
you've got to really mean it...

1683
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:46,800
which no one ever does.

1684
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:50,200
It took a while to convince
Archbishop Melker...

1685
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:51,700
that Adam wasn't God...

1686
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:54,100
and he was pretty broken up
about it, too...

1687
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:55,600
until I showed him my plans...

1688
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:58,200
for Los Angeles' hottest
and most original night spot.

1689
01:42:58,200 --> 01:42:59,700
It's my goddamned malt shop.

1690
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:02,200
Now let's just figure out
what's gonna happen here.

1691
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:04,200
Now I want
the whole ownership...

1692
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:06,200
of everything downstairs, right?

1693
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,800
I want one of my guys
at the door.

1694
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:13,700
Our idea
was to bring Adam's parents...

1695
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:16,500
up to the surface very slowly...

1696
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:18,000
make them very comfortable...

1697
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
and then break
the bad news to them...

1698
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:22,500
that there was
no nuclear holocaust.

1699
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:52,900
Oh, son.

1700
01:43:58,300 --> 01:44:00,800
And here you go. Oh, careful.

1701
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,800
It's hot.

1702
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:11,900
Careful.

1703
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:16,500
Have you ever in your life...

1704
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:19,200
seen a son who did more
for his parents?

1705
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:22,200
This is beautiful.

1706
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:26,200
It's absolutely beautiful.

1707
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:28,500
Well, uh...

1708
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:30,500
we seem to have everything...

1709
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:32,400
but, you know...

1710
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,500
it's not much different...

1711
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,000
from a fallout shelter.

1712
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:39,800
No, Calvin.

1713
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:41,000
This is different.

1714
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:42,600
Believe me.

1715
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:48,700
This is great...

1716
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:50,200
son.

1717
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:54,200
By the way...

1718
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:57,700
Eve. Her last name.

1719
01:44:57,700 --> 01:44:59,200
Vrustikov.

1720
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:00,800
That's not Russian, is it?

1721
01:45:00,900 --> 01:45:02,300
No, it's Ukrainian.

1722
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:05,000
Her grandparents immigrated.

1723
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:09,700
Dad, I don't know
how to tell you this...

1724
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:13,300
and I was gonna wait
for a while to do it, but...

1725
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:17,700
Dad, there was no bomb.

1726
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:19,700
A plane crashed
in our backyard.

1727
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:22,200
I looked it up
in old newspapers.

1728
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:25,700
-You sure?
-Positive.

1729
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:28,700
The Soviet Union collapsed
without a shot being fired.

1730
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:30,400
The cold war's over.

1731
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:36,800
That's what everyone believes.

1732
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:38,300
Oh, yes, sir.

1733
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:40,300
Mm-hmm. It's true.

1734
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:43,900
What, the politburo...

1735
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:45,100
one day said...

1736
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:47,600
"we give up"?

1737
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,000
Yes, just...

1738
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:52,600
That's kinda how it went.

1739
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:54,100
By gosh!

1740
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:56,000
These commies are brilliant.

1741
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:58,000
You have to hand it to them.

1742
01:45:58,100 --> 01:46:00,600
No, we didn't drop any bombs.

1743
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:05,100
Oh, yeah. Our evil empire
has collapsed. Poor us.

1744
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:07,000
I'll bet...

1745
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,500
they even asked the West
for aid.

1746
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:11,000
Right?

1747
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,700
Um, I think they did.

1748
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:14,900
Oh, boys.

1749
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:16,900
Dinnertime!

1750
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:18,400
Pot roast.

1751
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:25,000
I tell ya.

1752
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,800
Funny guy.

1753
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,800
-Don't tell your mother.
-No.

1754
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:36,200
Adam says that
this is simply how things work.

1755
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:38,700
First the parents
take care of the children...

1756
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:41,700
and then the children
take care of the parents.

1757
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:44,800
He says, historically,
that's how it works.

1758
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:46,900
Damn commies.

1759
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,100
Whenever Adam gives me...

1760
01:46:52,100 --> 01:46:54,700
such obviously
incorrect information...

1761
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:58,500
I just smile,
slap him on the knee...

1762
01:46:58,500 --> 01:46:59,700
and look out the window.

1763
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:02,800
Why spoil his dreams?

1764
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:05,200
They're such wonderful dreams.
