1
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,606  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:529
Excuse me, miss.
There seems to be a mistake.

2
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:15,317  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:500 Y2:535
I ordered the large cappuccino.

3
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,400  X1:318 X2:397 Y1:500 Y2:529
Hello!

4
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:20,527  X1:190 X2:524 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Look at the size of this.
-It's a bowl.

5
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:22,999  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:500 Y2:535
It's like Campbell's cup-o-ccino.

6
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:27,208  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:500 Y2:535
My sides. Please. Aidez-moi.

7
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:31,802  X1:288 X2:427 Y1:500 Y2:535
So Tony...

8
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:34,526  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:500 Y2:535
...what's with your clothes?

9
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:36,722  X1:314 X2:401 Y1:500 Y2:529
What?

10
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:39,722  X1:201 X2:512 Y1:452 Y2:535
You look like you're in
Starsky and Hutch.

11
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,437  X1:277 X2:437 Y1:452 Y2:534
-I look hip.
-No, no, no.

12
00:03:42,649 --> 00:03:45,322  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:535
More like an undercover cop
trying to be.

13
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:49,678  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:535
-I am a cop trying to look hip.
-Can you do me a favour?

14
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:53,888  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:452 Y2:535
When you go to my parents'
don't dress like a 1 970s pimp.

15
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:56,802  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:500 Y2:535
My parents are a little eccentric.

16
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:01,960  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:529
This poem is called, "An Apology
To The Aliens Who Abducted Me...

17
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,564  X1:204 X2:512 Y1:452 Y2:535
...and Whom I lnflicted
Destruction Upon...

18
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,602  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:452 Y2:535
...While Having a Panic Attack
Aboard the Ship."

19
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:09,606  X1:234 X2:480 Y1:500 Y2:535
Autobiographical.

20
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,206  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:529
-What are you gonna do tonight?
-Well...

21
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:18,408  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:500 Y2:535
...l'm gonna do a poem about Sherri.

22
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:24,002  X1:064 X2:651 Y1:452 Y2:529
-The "Woman, Woe Man, Whoa Man" poem.
-Yeah.

23
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:29,682  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:452 Y2:535
Tell me again.
Why did you break up with Sherri?

24
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:32,648  X1:190 X2:524 Y1:452 Y2:529
Tony, I told you already,
she's a thief.

25
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:36,444  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:452 Y2:535
-You don't honestly believe that?
-Tony, she's a klepto.

26
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:40,204  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:535
To this day I still don't know
where my cat is.

27
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:44,080  X1:206 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:535
Charlie, every time
you meet a nice girl...

28
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:47,605  X1:124 X2:590 Y1:452 Y2:529
-...you get paranoid and break up.
-That's not true.

29
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:50,283  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:452 Y2:535
-I broke up for good reasons.
-Really?

30
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:52,997  X1:241 X2:475 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Yes.
-What about Jill?

31
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:55,328  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:500 Y2:529
She was in the Mafia.

32
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:59,726  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:452 Y2:534
-She was in the Mafia?
-Yes, the Cosa Nostra.

33
00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:04,008  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:452 Y2:535
-I never knew how she made a living.
-She was unemployed.

34
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:07,042  X1:197 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:535
-She didn't work.
-That's a perfect cover.

35
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:10,560  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:500 Y2:535
All right. What about Pam?

36
00:05:13,489 --> 00:05:15,400  X1:201 X2:513 Y1:500 Y2:535
She smelled like soup.

37
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:21,285  X1:175 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:535
-What does that mean?
-Like beef-vegetable soup.

38
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,599  X1:227 X2:488 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Paranoid.
-You weren't there.

39
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:25,401  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:500 Y2:535
It's all in your head.

40
00:05:25,609 --> 00:05:27,008  X1:327 X2:388 Y1:500 Y2:529
It is.

41
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:33,323  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:452 Y2:529
-I'm up. Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

42
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:44,048  X1:114 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:529
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it
for our own Mr. Charlie MacKenzie.

43
00:05:58,089 --> 00:05:59,488  X1:310 X2:409 Y1:500 Y2:529
Woman

44
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:01,242  X1:297 X2:421 Y1:500 Y2:529
Woe man

45
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:04,009  X1:289 X2:430 Y1:500 Y2:529
Whoa man

46
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:07,801  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:452 Y2:535
She was a thief
You gotta believe

47
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:11,001  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:500 Y2:535
She stole my heart and my cat

48
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:13,208  X1:321 X2:396 Y1:500 Y2:535
Betty

49
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:14,843  X1:324 X2:393 Y1:500 Y2:535
Judy

50
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:18,246  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:500 Y2:535
Josie and those hot Pussycats

51
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:21,805  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:452 Y2:535
They make me horny
Saturday morny

52
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,280  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:529
Girls of cartoons
Won't leave me in ruins

53
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:28,401  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:500 Y2:535
I want to be Betty's Barney

54
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,962  X1:212 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:535
Hey, Jane, get me off
This crazy thing...

55
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:35,605  X1:269 X2:448 Y1:500 Y2:529
... called love

56
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:35,798  X1:333 X2:381 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Hi.
-Hi.

57
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:37,408  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:500 Y2:535
Can I help you?

58
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:43,128  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:452 Y2:534
-Yes, do you have haggis?
-Yes, we do. One?

59
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:44,842  X1:272 X2:441 Y1:500 Y2:535
Yes, please.

60
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,205  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:500 Y2:535
My parents are Scottish.

61
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:54,488  X1:224 X2:490 Y1:498 Y2:532
That will be $1 9.75.

62
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,801  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:500 Y2:535
Here you go.

63
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:01,002  X1:282 X2:433 Y1:500 Y2:535
Thank you.

64
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:05,321  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:452 Y2:534
-Will there be anything else?
-No, thanks.

65
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:09,242  X1:303 X2:411 Y1:500 Y2:529
Thanks.

66
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:49,400  X1:243 X2:472 Y1:500 Y2:535
May, get in here!

67
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:12,606  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:452 Y2:535
All right, May, turn off
the Bay City rollers!

68
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:15,403  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:500 Y2:535
The soccer game's about to begin!

69
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:23,798  X1:312 X2:402 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Hello.
-Hi!

70
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:27,401  X1:226 X2:486 Y1:500 Y2:534
We're in here, son!

71
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:29,765  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Charlie.
-How's it going, William?

72
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:33,564  X1:188 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:535
Give your mother a kiss,
or I'll kick your teeth in.

73
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:35,601  X1:299 X2:415 Y1:500 Y2:535
Hi. Hey!

74
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:41,560  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:500 Y2:535
May. Shut it!

75
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:45,286  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:529
-How you doing, Dad?
-Fine.

76
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:49,078  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Come on, Charlie.
-Away you go with your mother.

77
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:52,401  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:535
Why don't you try one
of her bras on, wee girl?

78
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:54,725  X1:201 X2:513 Y1:500 Y2:535
Flaunt away, you fairy!

79
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:55,998  X1:287 X2:429 Y1:500 Y2:535
Hey, Mom.

80
00:09:56,569 --> 00:09:58,799  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:500 Y2:535
I brought you guys a haggis.

81
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:02,645  X1:185 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:535
That's sweet of you, son.
Thank you.

82
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:06,404  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:500 Y2:535
I haven't seen one of these for years.

83
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:09,806  X1:210 X2:504 Y1:452 Y2:535
Actually, I hate them.
But your father will--

84
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:15,968  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:452 Y2:535
Look. He's giving Tony all that
Lyndon H. LaRouche rubbish again.

85
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:20,278  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:535
It's a known fact, Sonny Jim,
that a secret society...

86
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:24,317  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:529
...of the five wealthiest people,
known as the Pentavirate...

87
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:28,442  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:535
...run everything in the world,
including the newspapers...

88
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:32,841  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:529
...and meet tri-annually at a secret
mansion in Colorado known as...

89
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:36,485  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:452 Y2:529
-..."The Meadows."
-Who's in the Pentavirate?

90
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,159  X1:155 X2:558 Y1:452 Y2:535
The Queen, the Vatican,
the Gettys, the Rothschilds...

91
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:43,327  X1:197 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:535
...and Colonel Sanders,
before he went tits-up.

92
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:47,525  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:452 Y2:535
I hated the Colonel,
with his wee beady eyes...

93
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:52,763  X1:107 X2:606 Y1:452 Y2:535
...and that smug look on his face.
"You're gonna buy my chicken. Oh!"

94
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:56,002  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:500 Y2:535
Dad, how can you hate the Colonel?

95
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:58,922  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:529
He puts addictive chemicals
in chicken...

96
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:01,927  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:452 Y2:529
...making you crave it fortnightly,
smart-ass!

97
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:04,399  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:500 Y2:535
Interesting. Cuckoo.

98
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:08,405  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:500 Y2:535
Charlie, would you like a juice?

99
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:13,998  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:535
Look at what I've bought myself,
a Juice Tiger.

100
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:17,599  X1:161 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:535
-A Juice Tiger?
-Yes, I juice everything now.

101
00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:19,202  X1:237 X2:478 Y1:500 Y2:529
I'm on a new diet.

102
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:22,845  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:529
I'm on a Weekly World News
Garth Brooks Juice Diet.

103
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:24,488  X1:304 X2:409 Y1:500 Y2:529
Scores!

104
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:27,965  X1:244 X2:470 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Margin, one-nil!
-Magic goal!

105
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:30,524  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:500 Y2:535
Let's have a look at the replay.

106
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:33,084  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:500 Y2:535
William, move your head.

107
00:11:34,849 --> 00:11:37,238  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:500 Y2:535
Look at the size of that boy's head.

108
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:39,883  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:500 Y2:535
It's like an orange on a toothpick.

109
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:43,405  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:452 Y2:535
-You'll give him a complex.
-That's a huge noggin.

110
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:47,602  X1:161 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:535
It's a virtual planetoid.
Has its own weather system!

111
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,603  X1:269 X2:446 Y1:500 Y2:529
Head! Move!

112
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:55,605  X1:226 X2:488 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Your Sherri's late.
-Mom...

113
00:11:55,809 --> 00:11:57,800  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:500 Y2:535
...Sherri and I broke up.

114
00:11:58,609 --> 00:12:00,406  X1:279 X2:437 Y1:500 Y2:529
Not Sherri?

115
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:03,406  X1:264 X2:451 Y1:500 Y2:529
I liked Sherri.

116
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,840  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:535
I didn't like the other girls
you brought home.

117
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:11,605  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Don't make it any harder for me.
-Why should I make it easier, son?

118
00:12:11,849 --> 00:12:15,478  X1:188 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:535
You were good together,
you and Sherri.

119
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:19,847  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:452 Y2:535
-I thought you'd marry.
-You know I'm terrified of marriage.

120
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:23,009  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:500 Y2:534
I know that, son. I know that.

121
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:28,043  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:452 Y2:535
Maybe it's better not to marry.
Did you read the paper?

122
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:30,843  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:452 Y2:535
-No.
-No? Where did I put it?

123
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:33,887  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:500 Y2:535
Stuart! Bring in the paper!

124
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:35,722  X1:261 X2:452 Y1:500 Y2:535
All right, hon!

125
00:12:35,969 --> 00:12:38,483  X1:222 X2:493 Y1:500 Y2:535
Head! Paper! Now!

126
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:41,402  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:452 Y2:535
Move that melon of yours
if you can.

127
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:44,800  X1:085 X2:630 Y1:500 Y2:535
Hauling that gargantuan cranium about.

128
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:47,517  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:500 Y2:535
No kidding. His head's like Sputnik.

129
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:50,004  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:500 Y2:535
Spherical, but pointy in parts.

130
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:52,720  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:500 Y2:534
That was offside, wasn't it?

131
00:12:52,969 --> 00:12:56,882  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:535
He'll be crying himself to sleep
tonight on his huge pillow.

132
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:01,406  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:535
Mom, why do you refer to
Weekly World News...

133
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:05,488  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:452 Y2:535
...as "the paper"?
The paper contains facts.

134
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:08,598  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:500 Y2:535
This paper contains facts.

135
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:14,003  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:452 Y2:529
And this paper has the eighth-highest
circulation in the whole wide world.

136
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:17,963  X1:162 X2:551 Y1:042 Y2:124
Plenty of facts.
" Pregnant Man Gives Birth."

137
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:20,000  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:042 Y2:070
That's a fact.

138
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:23,643  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:500 Y2:534
Here it is, look. Read this.

139
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:27,804  X1:105 X2:608 Y1:500 Y2:535
" Mrs. X. The honeymoon murderer."

140
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:34,048  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:452 Y2:529
She marries men under fake identities
and then she murders them.

141
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:39,843  X1:080 X2:633 Y1:452 Y2:535
She's murdered three men already.
Victim number one was a lounge singer.

142
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:44,605  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:452 Y2:535
Victim number two,
a Russian martial arts expert.

143
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:50,120  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:452 Y2:535
And she's also killed a plumber
named Ralph Elliot.

144
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:55,799  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:500 Y2:529
And her whereabouts are unknown.

145
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:29,004  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:535
Give us a kiss, Tony,
and cheer me up. Good night.

146
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:38,728  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:452 Y2:529
Wow, you've turned into a sexy
wee bastard. You know that?

147
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:40,442  X1:186 X2:528 Y1:500 Y2:534
Thanks, Mrs. MacKenzie.

148
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:42,685  X1:279 X2:436 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Hasn't he?
-I think so.

149
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:45,643  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Good night, Mom.
-Good night, Charlie.

150
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:50,599  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Good night, Dad.
-Fine, go. You've stayed your hour.

151
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:01,602  X1:292 X2:422 Y1:500 Y2:535
Ooh, yes.

152
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:43,998  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Morning, Charles.
-Morning, sir.

153
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:49,727  X1:152 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:529
Are you working on the forms
for the vendor--?

154
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:51,163  X1:267 X2:447 Y1:500 Y2:535
Yes, captain.

155
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:54,008  X1:264 X2:451 Y1:500 Y2:535
Tony? Tony?

156
00:15:58,049 --> 00:16:01,485  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:535
I don't want to intrude,
but you seem a little down.

157
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:06,004  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:500 Y2:535
Well, captain, it's about my job.

158
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:10,278  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:500 Y2:535
I'm having doubts about being a cop.

159
00:16:10,849 --> 00:16:13,647  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:500 Y2:529
It's not like how it is on TV.

160
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:17,165  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:452 Y2:535
I fill out forms and paperwork
all day.

161
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:22,403  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:535
Point well taken, but even though
it's not exciting...

162
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,002  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:500 Y2:535
...it's very important.

163
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,605  X1:118 X2:594 Y1:452 Y2:529
Yeah, but of all my times as a cop,
I've never....

164
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:30,846  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:535
I never chased a guy
across a crowded square.

165
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:35,765  X1:109 X2:605 Y1:452 Y2:535
I've never hung onto that part of
the helicopter. You know that part?

166
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:37,607  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:452 Y2:529
-You know?
-I know it.

167
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:41,728  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:452 Y2:529
I've never hung onto that
or even commandeered a vehicle.

168
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:45,922  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:452 Y2:535
-That sounds like a lot of fun.
-That's the other thing.

169
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:47,522  X1:247 X2:466 Y1:500 Y2:529
You're too nice.

170
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,769  X1:210 X2:504 Y1:452 Y2:535
-I'm too nice?
-Yes, you're too nice.

171
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,881  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:452 Y2:535
Why not be like a
Starsky and Hutch captain?

172
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:58,638  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:452 Y2:529
Where you haul me in your office
and bawl me out...

173
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:03,041  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:452 Y2:529
...because you're tired of defending
me from the commissioner.

174
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:06,804  X1:107 X2:607 Y1:500 Y2:535
The truth is, I report to a committee.

175
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:10,718  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:535
Some are appointed, elected,
or co-opted biannually.

176
00:17:10,969 --> 00:17:14,006  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:452 Y2:535
-It's a quorum, so to speak.
-A quorum?

177
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:17,605  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:500 Y2:535
I thought I was gonna be Serpico...

178
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:21,404  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:452 Y2:535
...but instead I'm like Fish
from Barney Miller.

179
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:23,805  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:500 Y2:535
Hey, somebody needs a hug.

180
00:17:25,249 --> 00:17:26,125  X1:301 X2:414 Y1:500 Y2:535
Captain.

181
00:17:32,489 --> 00:17:34,400  X1:238 X2:477 Y1:500 Y2:535
Okay, coming up.

182
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:48,448  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Hi.
-Haggis, right?

183
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:51,408  X1:190 X2:524 Y1:452 Y2:535
Yeah, I'm the guy
who ordered the haggis.

184
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:54,319  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

185
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:57,527  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Do you like haggis?
-No, it's repellent.

186
00:17:57,729 --> 00:18:00,801  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:452 Y2:529
I think Scottish cuisine
is based on a dare.

187
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:03,085  X1:269 X2:445 Y1:452 Y2:529
-I'm next.
-You're next.

188
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:04,603  X1:216 X2:498 Y1:500 Y2:535
Yes, can I help you?

189
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:09,644  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:529
I'll tell you how you can help me.
All I want is one New York steak...

190
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:13,404  X1:159 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:534
...a quarter-inch thick.
That's all. No more, no less.

191
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:17,522  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Get it and let me out.
-I'm really busy. Be right back.

192
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:23,408  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:535
-It's busy, hey?
-It's insane today.

193
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:28,006  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:452 Y2:535
My dad's a butcher,
and I used to work at his shop.

194
00:18:28,249 --> 00:18:31,127  X1:222 X2:492 Y1:452 Y2:535
-I can help you.
-I'd love some help.

195
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:33,678  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Great, what's your name?
-Charlie.

196
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,487  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:452 Y2:534
-Harriet.
-Hi, Harriet.

197
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:38,402  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Could you get four porterhouses?
-Okay.

198
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:32,447  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:500 Y2:535
Just kidding.

199
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:34,002  X1:339 X2:376 Y1:500 Y2:529
Hi.

200
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,719  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:500 Y2:535
So do you live in New York?

201
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:54,204  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:500 Y2:535
Really?

202
00:19:54,649 --> 00:19:59,439  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:452 Y2:535
Just tell me if that's too tense.
You guide me. You guide me.

203
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:07,401  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:500 Y2:535
Mom, can you get the school nurse?

204
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:09,719  X1:139 X2:574 Y1:500 Y2:535
Get the school nurse! Help me!

205
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:12,722  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:500 Y2:535
It was an accident in shop.

206
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:17,199  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:535
Get me a tourniquet?
Anything.

207
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:30,646  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:452 Y2:535
Thanks for helping me out
at the butcher shop.

208
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:33,642  X1:207 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:534
-You were really nice.
-Oh, I was nice?

209
00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:37,928  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:529
" Nice." Evidently you think of me
as a woman friend.

210
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:41,206  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:452 Y2:535
-And what is wrong with being nice?
-Nothing.

211
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:42,685  X1:294 X2:421 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Charlie?
-Yes?

212
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:46,365  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Name a bad thing you've done.
-I've done bad things.

213
00:20:46,569 --> 00:20:50,562  X1:117 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:529
Tell me one bad thing you've done,
and it better be evil.

214
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:55,398  X1:275 X2:439 Y1:452 Y2:535
-How evil?
-Really evil.

215
00:20:55,609 --> 00:20:59,318  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:452 Y2:535
So evil that you would
say it was "e-vil."

216
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:03,118  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:452 Y2:529
Like it's "the fruits of the De-vil."
" E-vil."

217
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:08,317  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:535
For example, how many people
have you brutally murdered?

218
00:21:10,489 --> 00:21:12,844  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:500 Y2:535
" Brutal" is a very subjective word.

219
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:18,288  X1:087 X2:627 Y1:452 Y2:535
What's brutal to one person
might be reasonable to somebody else.

220
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:38,206  X1:279 X2:436 Y1:500 Y2:529
Excuse me.

221
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:54,600  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:500 Y2:535
Do you know Russian?

222
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:57,802  X1:318 X2:396 Y1:500 Y2:529
Yeah.

223
00:21:58,209 --> 00:22:01,918  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:500 Y2:534
Oh, this hurts. No, this is hard.

224
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:05,286  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:535
Not only are you
extremely good-looking...

225
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:09,204  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:529
...but you're also very smart
and that's no fair.

226
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:12,242  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:535
-That's hard.
-Bright women intimidate you?

227
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:14,798  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:500 Y2:534
No, no. Not at all.

228
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:18,719  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:452 Y2:535
But it's a shame I'm going
to have to destroy you.

229
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:27,723  X1:217 X2:496 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Charlie, come here!
-Nadia...

230
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,408  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:500 Y2:535
...l am coming.

231
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:37,566  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:500 Y2:535
Expand, contract, expand.

232
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:41,167  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:452 Y2:535
What do you look for
in a woman you date?

233
00:22:42,689 --> 00:22:46,318  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:529
I know everyone always says
sense of humour...

234
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:49,242  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:500 Y2:535
...but I have to go with breast size.

235
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:51,803  X1:273 X2:442 Y1:500 Y2:535
Oh, my God.

236
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:55,286  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:452 Y2:535
Come! Let us dance like
children of the night.

237
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:07,804  X1:174 X2:540 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Here we are.
-Wow! What a great place.

238
00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:10,605  X1:280 X2:435 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Some tea?
-Sure.

239
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:12,999  X1:164 X2:549 Y1:500 Y2:535
Well, show yourself around.

240
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:22,688  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:535
You know what this place needs?
A large poster of Atlantic City.

241
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:26,444  X1:205 X2:509 Y1:500 Y2:535
Oh, look, you got one!

242
00:23:26,689 --> 00:23:29,442  X1:224 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:529
I used to live there.
I have herbal teas:

243
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:31,964  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:500 Y2:535
Cubby Wubby Womb Room tea...

244
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:35,525  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:535
-...and Morning Thunder.
-I'll go with Cubby Wubby.

245
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:37,807  X1:241 X2:473 Y1:500 Y2:535
All right, thanks.

246
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,805  X1:271 X2:443 Y1:500 Y2:529
What's this?

247
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:49,001  X1:333 X2:380 Y1:500 Y2:529
Oh!

248
00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:57,723  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:535
I had a friend who was
a martial arts expert and....

249
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:01,405  X1:190 X2:524 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Oh, you had a friend?
-It's a martial arts thing.

250
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,288  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:535
I thought it would
look good on the wall.

251
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:06,440  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:500 Y2:529
It does.

252
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:09,607  X1:191 X2:522 Y1:452 Y2:529
You know, Scotland has
its own martial arts.

253
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:11,362  X1:203 X2:511 Y1:500 Y2:529
It's called " Fuck You!"

254
00:24:13,489 --> 00:24:17,402  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:452 Y2:535
It's mostly head-butting
and kicking people on the ground.

255
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:32,201  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:452 Y2:529
-It's late.
-Not for me.

256
00:24:32,689 --> 00:24:35,999  X1:210 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:534
-Who for, then?
-Who for, then, what?

257
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:39,406  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:452 Y2:529
If not for you,
I wonder who it is late for.

258
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:43,204  X1:232 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:535
Not me, no.
I like the nightlife.

259
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:44,763  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:500 Y2:535
I like to boogie.

260
00:24:46,689 --> 00:24:48,327  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:500 Y2:534
I'll make the tea, then.

261
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:02,802  X1:276 X2:437 Y1:500 Y2:529
You know...

262
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:08,161  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:500 Y2:535
...maybe it is late.

263
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:12,198  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:452 Y2:535
I'll be honest with you.
I had a great time tonight...

264
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:16,001  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:500 Y2:535
...and I'd really love to kiss you.

265
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:21,408  X1:113 X2:600 Y1:452 Y2:535
But if I kiss you, we'll end up on
the couch, and if we end up there...

266
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:25,397  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:529
...chances are we'll kiss
in the bedroom...

267
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:28,646  X1:219 X2:498 Y1:452 Y2:535
...and that's the part
I always rush into.

268
00:25:28,849 --> 00:25:32,967  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:535
It's not a good idea to rush
into spending the night together.

269
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:34,927  X1:295 X2:421 Y1:500 Y2:529
I want to.

270
00:25:35,489 --> 00:25:37,605  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:500 Y2:535
I have no problem with that.

271
00:25:39,569 --> 00:25:40,922  X1:293 X2:420 Y1:500 Y2:529
You're it.

272
00:25:42,969 --> 00:25:43,845  X1:280 X2:435 Y1:500 Y2:529
Come here!

273
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:45,807  X1:238 X2:476 Y1:500 Y2:534
Oh, no! Oh, God!

274
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,005  X1:326 X2:387 Y1:500 Y2:529
Yes.

275
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:01,399  X1:326 X2:387 Y1:500 Y2:529
Yes.

276
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:06,403  X1:314 X2:401 Y1:500 Y2:535
Ralph!

277
00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:10,728  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:500 Y2:529
I will. I will.

278
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:13,759  X1:189 X2:524 Y1:500 Y2:534
Wait, not now! Not now!

279
00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:16,404  X1:260 X2:454 Y1:500 Y2:535
Ralph! Ralph!

280
00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:19,398  X1:306 X2:409 Y1:500 Y2:529
Harriet.

281
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:23,007  X1:178 X2:535 Y1:500 Y2:535
You were having a dream.

282
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:28,008  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:452 Y2:535
And you kept saying the name
" Ralph."

283
00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:36,404  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Ralph?
-Yeah, you kept saying " Ralph."

284
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:44,405  X1:245 X2:469 Y1:500 Y2:535
She's my friend.

285
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:49,598  X1:181 X2:533 Y1:500 Y2:535
She's your friend. Ralph.

286
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:54,641  X1:162 X2:552 Y1:500 Y2:535
"She" is your friend. Ralph.

287
00:26:54,889 --> 00:26:56,561  X1:275 X2:441 Y1:500 Y2:535
Ralph. She.

288
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:33,327  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:535
I'm sorry!
I thought you were somebody else!

289
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:52,400  X1:339 X2:376 Y1:500 Y2:529
Hi.

290
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:54,398  X1:339 X2:376 Y1:500 Y2:529
Hi.

291
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:59,644  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:452 Y2:535
I'm Harriet's friend, Charlie.
You must be Ralph?

292
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:02,080  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:500 Y2:534
I'm Harriet's sister, Rose.

293
00:28:02,689 --> 00:28:06,204  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:452 Y2:529
-She gave me a note to give to you.
-Great.

294
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:09,765  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:535
" Dear Charlie,
I didn't want to wake you.

295
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:14,002  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:452 Y2:529
Make yourself at home
and thanks for the...

296
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:16,448  X1:220 X2:494 Y1:500 Y2:535
...hot dog. Harriet."

297
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,798  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:500 Y2:535
That's a very nice note.

298
00:28:21,489 --> 00:28:26,404  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Let me make you some breakfast.
-I'd love to, but I'm running late.

299
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:29,083  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:500 Y2:535
How do silver-dollar pancakes...

300
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:33,362  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:529
...fresh orange juice, bacon
and Kona coffee sound?

301
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:34,928  X1:250 X2:466 Y1:500 Y2:535
It sounds great.

302
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:43,320  X1:221 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:535
Sorry. I didn't have
those other things.

303
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:47,045  X1:162 X2:552 Y1:452 Y2:535
That's fine.
That other stuff will kill you.

304
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:52,204  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:535
Whereas Froot Loops are light
and reasonably high in fibre.

305
00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:56,405  X1:110 X2:604 Y1:452 Y2:529
-I care for Apple Jacks a great deal.
-Got them.

306
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:57,838  X1:317 X2:398 Y1:500 Y2:529
Good.

307
00:28:58,969 --> 00:29:02,598  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:500 Y2:535
So, is this your place?

308
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:06,524  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:529
No, this is our place.
Harriet's and mine.

309
00:29:06,769 --> 00:29:10,478  X1:165 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:535
She sort of comes and goes
but always ends up here.

310
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:13,367  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:500 Y2:535
She didn't speak of me?

311
00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:17,207  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:500 Y2:535
No, she didn't "speak of you."

312
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:22,045  X1:086 X2:629 Y1:452 Y2:535
She mentioned a martial arts guy,
and there was discussion about Ralph?

313
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,961  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:500 Y2:535
Oh, really? She spoke about them?

314
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:31,723  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:452 Y2:535
She talked about the martial arts guy
and kind of shouted Ralph.

315
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:44,641  X1:192 X2:522 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Well, you know Harriet.
-Actually, I don't.

316
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:48,399  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:529
-But you did have sex with her.
-Hello!

317
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:50,968  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:500 Y2:535
I'm gonna go now.

318
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:57,201  X1:190 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:535
I won't tell Harriet
that anything happened.

319
00:29:57,649 --> 00:30:00,004  X1:279 X2:435 Y1:500 Y2:534
Well, Rose.

320
00:30:02,289 --> 00:30:04,598  X1:220 X2:496 Y1:500 Y2:535
Nothing did happen.

321
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:08,678  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:452 Y2:529
Don't worry, Charlie.
Just be careful.

322
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:16,605  X1:236 X2:478 Y1:500 Y2:529
"Just be careful."

323
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:23,520  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:452 Y2:535
I had the greatest night of my life
last night.

324
00:30:48,489 --> 00:30:52,801  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Sounds like you really like her.
-I'm smitten. I'm in deep smit.

325
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:56,524  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:452 Y2:529
She is wonderful.
But we shouldn't talk about it.

326
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,607  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:452 Y2:535
I'll start analysing it,
and that's no good.

327
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:03,438  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:452 Y2:535
That is good. You should
just let it happen. Relax.

328
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:07,598  X1:147 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:535
I am a park ranger,
and I will lead you on the tour.

329
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:11,882  X1:112 X2:602 Y1:452 Y2:535
All the rangers at Alcatraz
were once guards, myself included.

330
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:15,644  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:452 Y2:535
My name is John Johnson,
but everyone calls me Vickie.

331
00:31:15,889 --> 00:31:17,242  X1:237 X2:478 Y1:500 Y2:529
Please follow me.

332
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:21,320  X1:179 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:529
-I love Vickie. He's great.
-He's the best.

333
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:25,042  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:500 Y2:529
This is the main cellblock area.

334
00:31:25,249 --> 00:31:28,161  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:452 Y2:535
Home to such famous criminals
as AI Capone...

335
00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:31,242  X1:181 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:535
...Mickey Cohen,
Joseph " Dutch" Cretzer...

336
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:35,880  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:529
...and Robert Stroud,
the famous Birdman of Alcatraz.

337
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:41,117  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:452 Y2:535
This time will be different.
If something happens, I'll let it go.

338
00:31:41,329 --> 00:31:44,241  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:452 Y2:535
It's not my business.
For example, " Ralph."

339
00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:46,639  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:452 Y2:529
She says " Ralph" in her sleep.
So what?

340
00:31:46,849 --> 00:31:47,918  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:500 Y2:535
Ralph?

341
00:31:48,129 --> 00:31:50,404  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:452 Y2:535
This cell's for
solitary confinement...

342
00:31:50,649 --> 00:31:53,561  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:452 Y2:535
...that's come to be known
as "Times Square."

343
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:56,118  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:500 Y2:535
Make sure everyone gets a look.

344
00:31:58,369 --> 00:31:59,518  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:500 Y2:535
So who's Ralph?

345
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:03,318  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:529
I don't know. More importantly,
I don't want to know.

346
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:05,326  X1:272 X2:442 Y1:500 Y2:535
That's good.

347
00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:09,162  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:452 Y2:535
Did you and Harriet,
you know, last night?

348
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:10,728  X1:260 X2:454 Y1:500 Y2:535
Okay, dirtbag.

349
00:32:10,969 --> 00:32:15,167  X1:101 X2:613 Y1:452 Y2:535
All you have to know is that Harriet's
a sweet and loving person.

350
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:18,128  X1:147 X2:566 Y1:500 Y2:535
Well, that's good. That's nice.

351
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,929  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:452 Y2:535
-And yes, we did.
-All right!

352
00:32:21,569 --> 00:32:24,527  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:500 Y2:535
Close it up, close it up, close it up.

353
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:31,519  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:452 Y2:535
This is something the other
tour guides won't tell you.

354
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:34,568  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:535
In this cellblock,
Machine Gun Kelly...

355
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:39,325  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:452 Y2:535
...had what we call
in the prison system, a " bitch."

356
00:32:39,569 --> 00:32:44,723  X1:119 X2:594 Y1:452 Y2:534
One night, in a jealous rage, Kelly
took a makeshift knife, or "shiv" ...

357
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:48,805  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:500 Y2:535
...and cut out the bitch's eyes.

358
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:52,526  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:452 Y2:534
-Another thing about Harriet I love--
-No, no.

359
00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:03,759  X1:161 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:535
And as if this wasn't enough
retribution for Kelly...

360
00:33:04,009 --> 00:33:09,129  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:535
...the next day he and four
other inmates took turns pissing...

361
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:13,117  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:500 Y2:529
...into the bitch's ocular cavities.

362
00:33:16,689 --> 00:33:19,123  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:500 Y2:535
This way to the cafeteria.

363
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:22,604  X1:200 X2:514 Y1:500 Y2:535
Tony, I'm really happy.

364
00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:25,761  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:452 Y2:535
Please, don't let me screw
this one up.

365
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:28,125  X1:293 X2:422 Y1:452 Y2:535
-I'll try.
-Alrighty.

366
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:32,806  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:535
-That ocular cavity thing was--
-When he mentioned pissing into....

367
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:34,119  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:529
Okay, I got another one.
What's worse?

368
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:38,408  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:535
The cable goes out and you're left
with synchronized swimming...

369
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:40,321  X1:320 X2:396 Y1:506 Y2:529
...or--

370
00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:41,678  X1:318 X2:396 Y1:500 Y2:535
Okay.

371
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:44,562  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:529
You're stuck on the Bay Bridge
in traffic...

372
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:49,758  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:452 Y2:529
...and you've just had two strong cups
of coffee and three bran muffins.

373
00:34:52,249 --> 00:34:55,924  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:452 Y2:529
-No, wait. I have a good one.
-Hello! Hello!

374
00:34:56,169 --> 00:34:59,320  X1:100 X2:614 Y1:452 Y2:535
What's worse?
You go to your favourite restaurant...

375
00:34:59,569 --> 00:35:01,958  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:452 Y2:529
...order your favourite meal,
take a bite...

376
00:35:02,169 --> 00:35:06,048  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:452 Y2:535
...and under the steak
is a scabby Band-Aid.

377
00:35:06,249 --> 00:35:07,238  X1:323 X2:392 Y1:500 Y2:529
Or....

378
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:13,925  X1:203 X2:511 Y1:500 Y2:535
Or being electrocuted.

379
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:19,527  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:500 Y2:529
And?

380
00:35:19,729 --> 00:35:24,678  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:529
That's it. I was electrocuted once.
It was horrible.

381
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,722  X1:196 X2:518 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Oh, well, that's....
-That's a crying shame.

382
00:35:30,049 --> 00:35:33,325  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:529
Can we get our check, please?
Thanks a lot.

383
00:35:33,929 --> 00:35:35,681  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:500 Y2:529
Electrocuted.

384
00:35:35,889 --> 00:35:36,924  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:500 Y2:535
That was funny.

385
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:38,921  X1:273 X2:441 Y1:452 Y2:535
-I'll get that.
-No, I got it.

386
00:35:39,129 --> 00:35:42,883  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:534
-I'll get it. Charlie.
-No, it's mine. No, no, no.

387
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:46,923  X1:242 X2:473 Y1:452 Y2:534
-I got it. I insist.
-No, no, no.

388
00:35:47,169 --> 00:35:48,568  X1:262 X2:452 Y1:452 Y2:529
-" No" infinity.
-Come on.

389
00:35:48,809 --> 00:35:53,929  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Negatory, good buddy.
-You're embarrassing me.

390
00:35:54,129 --> 00:35:56,279  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:452 Y2:535
-I'll pick up the check.
-Okay.

391
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:01,967  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:500 Y2:529
You want to catch a cab?

392
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:05,167  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:452 Y2:535
-I'd like to walk.
-Come on, it's raining.

393
00:36:05,409 --> 00:36:08,128  X1:248 X2:467 Y1:452 Y2:529
-I'd like to walk.
-Me too.

394
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:10,724  X1:187 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:535
-All right. See you later.
-Bye.

395
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:12,925  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:500 Y2:535
Nice meeting you.

396
00:36:18,129 --> 00:36:21,565  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Well, it's officially raining.
-It's just a drizzle.

397
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:26,929  X1:129 X2:584 Y1:452 Y2:529
You know, I love that you wanted
to walk in the rain.

398
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:30,327  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:452 Y2:535
I'm glad you're meeting
my parents tomorrow.

399
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:32,161  X1:186 X2:528 Y1:500 Y2:534
You know what, Charlie?

400
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:35,845  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:452 Y2:535
It's strange,
but I feel really safe with you.

401
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:39,525  X1:118 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:535
Like in old movies
when people never left each other.

402
00:36:39,729 --> 00:36:42,527  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:500 Y2:535
I mean, they stayed together forever.

403
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,602  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:500 Y2:535
It's a great house.

404
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:02,363  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:535
They moved in
the day they were married.

405
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:06,045  X1:123 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:535
I'm throwing them
a 30th wedding anniversary party.

406
00:37:13,729 --> 00:37:15,526  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:042 Y2:075
Mom, Dad, we're here.

407
00:37:15,729 --> 00:37:17,526  X1:310 X2:403 Y1:500 Y2:529
Stuart!

408
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,440  X1:304 X2:411 Y1:500 Y2:529
Charlie!

409
00:37:25,689 --> 00:37:30,444  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:535
Is this the wee Harriet?
She's absolutely beautiful.

410
00:37:30,689 --> 00:37:33,522  X1:140 X2:574 Y1:500 Y2:535
And you're very, very welcome.

411
00:37:33,729 --> 00:37:35,720  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:500 Y2:535
I hope you hold on to this one.

412
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:39,319  X1:125 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:535
You have the face of a wee angel,
do you know that?

413
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:43,686  X1:222 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:529
I give! I give!
I'm Charlie's father.

414
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:47,958  X1:155 X2:558 Y1:452 Y2:535
Sorry. I'm sorry.
You surprised me. I'm sorry.

415
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:52,327  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:452 Y2:535
I like this one, Charlie.
She's quite a filly.

416
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:55,129  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:500 Y2:535
Charlie tells me you're a butcher.

417
00:37:55,369 --> 00:37:57,246  X1:219 X2:495 Y1:500 Y2:534
Yes, I am a butcher.

418
00:37:57,489 --> 00:37:59,525  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:500 Y2:535
Do you link your own sausage?

419
00:38:00,369 --> 00:38:01,358  X1:328 X2:388 Y1:500 Y2:529
I do.

420
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:05,124  X1:100 X2:615 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Why don't you put your trousers on?
-Hold your horses.

421
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:08,526  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:500 Y2:529
Head! Pants! Now!

422
00:38:10,529 --> 00:38:12,326  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:500 Y2:535
Why don't you come with me?

423
00:38:12,569 --> 00:38:16,084  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:452 Y2:535
I have wonderful photos
of when he was a wee baby.

424
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:19,679  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:452 Y2:535
Like one of him shitting
his pants at Niagara Falls.

425
00:38:19,889 --> 00:38:22,119  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:500 Y2:535
Come on, don't show her the pictures.

426
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:27,323  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:452 Y2:535
Lighten up, Charlie. You've got
a pickle up your ass again.

427
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:34,159  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:500 Y2:535
I'm going to the washroom, okay?

428
00:38:34,409 --> 00:38:37,526  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:500 Y2:535
Evidently, I have a pickle up my ass.

429
00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:41,927  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:535
-You'll be okay if I leave you?
-Fine. Don't worry about me.

430
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:45,925  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:500 Y2:535
Make sure there's enough paper.

431
00:38:46,129 --> 00:38:49,565  X1:172 X2:541 Y1:500 Y2:535
And Charlie, light a match!

432
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:52,727  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:500 Y2:535
Are you away to crap, again?

433
00:38:58,489 --> 00:39:01,526  X1:148 X2:564 Y1:500 Y2:535
What a cute baby Charlie was!

434
00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:04,880  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:535
You okay in there?
You didn't fall in there, did you?

435
00:39:47,689 --> 00:39:51,238  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:535
I can't believe the resemblance
between you and Charlie.

436
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:52,524  X1:282 X2:433 Y1:500 Y2:535
Thank you.

437
00:39:52,729 --> 00:39:57,405  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:452 Y2:535
That's enough about us.
Tell me something about yourself.

438
00:39:57,649 --> 00:40:00,402  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:452 Y2:529
Have you always lived
in San Francisco?

439
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:05,124  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:452 Y2:535
No, actually I moved around
quite a bit.

440
00:40:18,889 --> 00:40:22,279  X1:188 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:535
I had a really great time
with your family tonight.

441
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:28,127  X1:289 X2:425 Y1:500 Y2:535
Oh, great.

442
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:34,328  X1:175 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:535
You know that martial arts
expert friend you had?

443
00:40:40,049 --> 00:40:42,609  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:500 Y2:529
Was that here in San Francisco?

444
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:46,925  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:500 Y2:535
No, actually it was Miami.

445
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:50,323  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:500 Y2:535
Your family's really great, Charlie.

446
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:55,324  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:452 Y2:535
-When your mother took out--
-Was that before Atlantic City?

447
00:40:55,569 --> 00:40:59,721  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:535
It's a period in my life that
I really don't like talking about.

448
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:03,321  X1:304 X2:411 Y1:500 Y2:529
Charlie.

449
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:07,359  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:500 Y2:535
I hated Atlantic City, Charlie.

450
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:11,124  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:535
It's a town full of gamblers
and lounge singers.

451
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:25,528  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:500 Y2:535
Ralph?

452
00:41:25,729 --> 00:41:28,118  X1:303 X2:412 Y1:500 Y2:529
No. No.

453
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:31,124  X1:285 X2:429 Y1:500 Y2:535
Oh, Ralph.

454
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:39,484  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:042 Y2:076
Have you heard of this? Mrs. X.

455
00:41:39,689 --> 00:41:44,160  X1:071 X2:644 Y1:452 Y2:535
She murders her husbands, then changes
her identity and marries again.

456
00:41:44,409 --> 00:41:46,923  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:500 Y2:529
I never heard of it. So what?

457
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:51,728  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:500 Y2:535
I think I'm dating Mrs. X.

458
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:55,041  X1:304 X2:411 Y1:500 Y2:529
Charlie.

459
00:41:57,209 --> 00:42:00,599  X1:210 X2:504 Y1:500 Y2:535
Two words. Therapy.

460
00:42:03,009 --> 00:42:05,728  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:452 Y2:535
She told me she dated
a martial arts expert.

461
00:42:05,969 --> 00:42:09,962  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:452 Y2:535
It says that one of the victims
was a martial arts expert.

462
00:42:10,209 --> 00:42:14,327  X1:092 X2:622 Y1:452 Y2:535
Last night, she put a move
on my dad and tried to break his neck.

463
00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:17,999  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:452 Y2:529
About 1 000 people
have tried to break his neck.

464
00:42:18,249 --> 00:42:22,447  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:535
If they also say " Ralph" in their
sleep, it's a good start.

465
00:42:22,689 --> 00:42:24,407  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:500 Y2:535
Look here, " Ralph Elliot.

466
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:29,125  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:452 Y2:535
Plumber from Dallas.
Missing since his honeymoon."

467
00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:32,361  X1:112 X2:602 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Charlie, you're just getting scared.
-Yes.

468
00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:34,520  X1:181 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Harriet could be the one.
-Yes.

469
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:38,364  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:452 Y2:535
You suspect her, because
you're scared you'll marry her.

470
00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:40,167  X1:192 X2:522 Y1:500 Y2:535
And to you that's death.

471
00:42:40,969 --> 00:42:43,119  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:500 Y2:535
Come on, just read it, okay?

472
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:46,924  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:500 Y2:535
Read it. For me, just read it?

473
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:55,723  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:452 Y2:529
-" Larry Leonard, the croner..."
-Crooner.

474
00:42:55,929 --> 00:42:57,647  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:500 Y2:529
" ...made a name for himself...

475
00:42:57,889 --> 00:43:01,564  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:535
...being able to sing, in six
languages, 'Only You."'

476
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:04,642  X1:181 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:535
Does Harriet know
the words to "Only You"?

477
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:07,644  X1:124 X2:589 Y1:500 Y2:529
We haven't reached that critical...

478
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:10,642  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:452 Y2:535
..." Do you know the words
to 'Only You"' phase.

479
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:14,040  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:529
-So I'm afraid I'm not much help.
-Charlie!

480
00:43:14,289 --> 00:43:16,325  X1:180 X2:533 Y1:500 Y2:535
You gotta move past this!

481
00:43:16,529 --> 00:43:20,647  X1:101 X2:612 Y1:452 Y2:535
I'm worried. You're living
according to the Weekly World News.

482
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:26,088  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:452 Y2:535
It's the 8th highest circulating paper
in the world, I'll have you know.

483
00:43:26,489 --> 00:43:28,366  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:500 Y2:535
Look, Tony, Mrs. X.

484
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:31,043  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:500 Y2:535
Please, look it up, okay?

485
00:43:31,289 --> 00:43:34,042  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:500 Y2:535
For me? lndulge me?

486
00:43:35,169 --> 00:43:37,125  X1:162 X2:552 Y1:500 Y2:529
There's no record of deaths.

487
00:43:37,329 --> 00:43:41,925  X1:134 X2:578 Y1:452 Y2:529
All three were reported missing,
but so were their wives.

488
00:43:42,169 --> 00:43:46,526  X1:089 X2:627 Y1:452 Y2:535
No picture of any brides.
For all we know, they just moved away.

489
00:43:46,729 --> 00:43:49,926  X1:124 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:535
That's true.
You're gonna have to realize that.

490
00:43:50,129 --> 00:43:54,805  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:535
I would lie to you,
but Kathy always tells the truth.

491
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,528  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:500 Y2:529
Understood.

492
00:43:56,769 --> 00:43:58,122  X1:214 X2:500 Y1:500 Y2:529
You feel better now?

493
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:01,605  X1:195 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:535
-I guess so.
-Good, good. Come on.

494
00:44:06,569 --> 00:44:10,039  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:529
I'm Maureen O'Boyle.
Welcome to A Current Affair.

495
00:44:10,249 --> 00:44:13,366  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:500 Y2:535
Tonight.: Amy, did she or didn't she?

496
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:16,641  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:535
Then, the reptile
that took Hollywood by storm.

497
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:19,005  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:042 Y2:076
"Iguana be in pictures. "

498
00:44:19,209 --> 00:44:23,248  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:535
But first, the Justice Department
reports an alarming rise...

499
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:26,606  X1:206 X2:508 Y1:452 Y2:535
... in the number
of poisoning murders.

500
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:31,121  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:535
And that 87%%% of the murders
occur within the family...

501
00:44:31,329 --> 00:44:35,527  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:535
...a scourge which seems to be
reaching into every home.

502
00:44:35,769 --> 00:44:39,159  X1:170 X2:542 Y1:452 Y2:535
Steve Dunleavy examines
poisoning murders. Steve.

503
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:42,560  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:535
The most common poisonings
occur between couples.

504
00:44:42,769 --> 00:44:46,239  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:452 Y2:535
For reasons as varied
as insurance fraud, jealousy...

505
00:44:46,489 --> 00:44:49,322  X1:109 X2:604 Y1:500 Y2:535
...and pure psychopathic behaviour.

506
00:44:54,209 --> 00:44:56,359  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:500 Y2:535
I have a surprise for you.

507
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:57,684  X1:283 X2:432 Y1:500 Y2:529
What is it?

508
00:44:57,889 --> 00:44:59,845  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:500 Y2:529
It's a health shake.

509
00:45:01,009 --> 00:45:03,239  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:500 Y2:535
I made it especially for you.

510
00:45:03,449 --> 00:45:04,768  X1:316 X2:398 Y1:500 Y2:535
Try it.

511
00:45:07,769 --> 00:45:09,805  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:500 Y2:535
Thank you, no. Thanks.

512
00:45:10,769 --> 00:45:13,841  X1:210 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:535
You'll like it, Charlie.
Just take a sip.

513
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:18,128  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:452 Y2:535
I have kitten breath.
I'm just gonna go brush my teeth.

514
00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:20,445  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:500 Y2:535
Why don't you just taste it?

515
00:45:20,689 --> 00:45:22,884  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:529
It's got strawberries.
Taste it.

516
00:45:23,089 --> 00:45:24,841  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:500 Y2:535
I spent 20 minutes making it.

517
00:45:25,049 --> 00:45:29,122  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:452 Y2:535
-One little sip. It wouldn't hurt--
-I'm just gonna go.

518
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:39,123  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:500 Y2:535
Fine. Forget it. Forget it.

519
00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:22,126  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:500 Y2:535
I'm sorry.

520
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:24,327  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:500 Y2:535
That's okay.

521
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:28,359  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:500 Y2:535
I'm just sensitive.

522
00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:33,000  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:452 Y2:535
I mean, you didn't drink my shake.
So what? Right?

523
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:37,487  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:529
Look, you spent a half an hour on it.
I understand.

524
00:46:37,689 --> 00:46:39,327  X1:245 X2:469 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Let's scratch.
-It's depressing.

525
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:40,848  X1:291 X2:425 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Scratch.
-Scratch?

526
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:41,965  X1:300 X2:415 Y1:500 Y2:529
Scratch.

527
00:46:42,169 --> 00:46:45,002  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:535
Come on.
Let's do a little scratching.

528
00:46:45,729 --> 00:46:47,765  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:500 Y2:535
There you go. Scratching.

529
00:46:47,969 --> 00:46:49,925  X1:213 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Golden Gate Bridge.
-Golden.

530
00:46:50,129 --> 00:46:52,927  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Presidio. Union Square.
-Got it.

531
00:46:53,169 --> 00:46:54,648  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Little Japan.
-Got it.

532
00:46:54,889 --> 00:46:56,561  X1:261 X2:455 Y1:500 Y2:535
Union Square.

533
00:46:56,809 --> 00:47:00,358  X1:222 X2:492 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Oakland. Oakland.
-Oakland.

534
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,328  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:535
Can you reach around
and get Coit Tower?

535
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,485  X1:221 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:529
-San Andreas Fault.
-Charlie.

536
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:08,249  X1:100 X2:615 Y1:500 Y2:535
You know what I like best about you?

537
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:12,038  X1:192 X2:522 Y1:452 Y2:535
I can tell you anything,
and you don't judge me.

538
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:17,361  X1:205 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:535
Have you ever stood
at the edge of a cliff...

539
00:47:17,569 --> 00:47:20,641  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:500 Y2:535
...or subway platform with someone...

540
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:24,325  X1:199 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:535
...and you thought
just for a split second:

541
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,320  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:500 Y2:535
What if I pushed him?

542
00:47:27,529 --> 00:47:31,602  X1:157 X2:556 Y1:452 Y2:529
I follow the Judeo-Christian
ethic of "Thou shalt not kill."

543
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,444  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:535
-But that's just me.
-I'm just making a point...

544
00:47:35,649 --> 00:47:39,119  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:452 Y2:535
...of how many times we trust
people with our lives.

545
00:47:39,329 --> 00:47:40,648  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:500 Y2:534
I mean, look at us.

546
00:47:40,889 --> 00:47:43,722  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:500 Y2:535
Look how vulnerable we are, sleeping.

547
00:47:43,969 --> 00:47:47,359  X1:214 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:535
I could do anything
to you in your sleep.

548
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:48,928  X1:284 X2:432 Y1:500 Y2:529
Like what?

549
00:47:49,129 --> 00:47:50,847  X1:290 X2:423 Y1:500 Y2:535
Anything.

550
00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:54,559  X1:217 X2:496 Y1:452 Y2:535
You're on your side,
asleep, I could...

551
00:47:54,809 --> 00:47:57,926  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:500 Y2:535
...stick a needle in your--

552
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:03,921  X1:249 X2:465 Y1:500 Y2:529
Charlie! Jesus!

553
00:48:04,169 --> 00:48:07,559  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:452 Y2:535
I'm showing you we have
a good relationship!

554
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:10,562  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:500 Y2:535
I'm sorry, but I have an ear thing.

555
00:48:10,809 --> 00:48:14,722  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:452 Y2:535
In an episode of Night Gallery,
this guy gets an earwig.

556
00:48:14,929 --> 00:48:17,966  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:452 Y2:535
They said the good news
is, we got the earwig...

557
00:48:18,209 --> 00:48:21,121  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:452 Y2:534
...but the bad news
is, it was a female.

558
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:22,848  X1:272 X2:442 Y1:452 Y2:535
-I'm sorry.
-Good night.

559
00:48:23,049 --> 00:48:24,926  X1:219 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:535
-I have an ear thing.
-Good night.

560
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:27,444  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:500 Y2:535
I'm sorry.

561
00:48:27,689 --> 00:48:32,126  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:535
-I'm a human blanket.
-Get off. Just, good night.

562
00:48:35,729 --> 00:48:37,321  X1:240 X2:474 Y1:500 Y2:535
Well, good night.

563
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:01,202  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:500 Y2:535
Can I help you?

564
00:49:01,449 --> 00:49:03,599  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:500 Y2:535
I'd like to place an announcement.

565
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:06,443  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:500 Y2:535
It's my parents' 30th anniversary.

566
00:49:06,689 --> 00:49:08,725  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:498 Y2:535
That's $4.50 per word...

567
00:49:08,929 --> 00:49:12,239  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:529
...and you've got a choice
of standard or bold.

568
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:14,764  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:500 Y2:535
You having a busy week, Frank?

569
00:49:15,009 --> 00:49:19,127  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:452 Y2:529
No, just these two.
It's been dead around here.

570
00:49:20,609 --> 00:49:24,238  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:452 Y2:529
I got this tourist,
heart attack on a cable car.

571
00:49:24,489 --> 00:49:27,322  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:500 Y2:535
Guy left his heart in San Francisco.

572
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:34,084  X1:214 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:535
That's a real person
you're talking about.

573
00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:36,359  X1:225 X2:488 Y1:500 Y2:535
All right, I'm sorry.

574
00:49:36,609 --> 00:49:40,966  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:452 Y2:535
There's another one.
San Francisco plumber: Elliot, Ralph.

575
00:49:42,369 --> 00:49:44,519  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:500 Y2:535
Disappeared four months ago.

576
00:49:44,729 --> 00:49:47,368  X1:140 X2:574 Y1:500 Y2:535
The body was found in a sewer.

577
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:51,397  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:452 Y2:535
Guy takes his job too seriously,
life goes down the drain.

578
00:49:55,089 --> 00:49:57,319  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:500 Y2:535
Did they mention his wife?

579
00:49:57,529 --> 00:50:02,125  X1:106 X2:608 Y1:452 Y2:535
I know that we're talking
about real people here, so I'm sorry.

580
00:50:02,329 --> 00:50:04,718  X1:101 X2:615 Y1:500 Y2:535
Seriously, did they mention the wife?

581
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:09,326  X1:121 X2:592 Y1:452 Y2:535
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to joke about other people's lives.

582
00:50:09,529 --> 00:50:11,918  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:500 Y2:535
I'm serious. Did they mention--?

583
00:50:12,169 --> 00:50:15,320  X1:124 X2:590 Y1:500 Y2:535
You win, okay? I'm a bad person.

584
00:50:15,569 --> 00:50:18,447  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Take it easy.
-No, he's saying I'm a shit.

585
00:50:18,689 --> 00:50:20,122  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:500 Y2:535
Did they mention the wife?

586
00:50:20,329 --> 00:50:21,921  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:500 Y2:535
Did they mention the wife!

587
00:50:22,129 --> 00:50:26,327  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:452 Y2:535
No! They didn't mention the wife!
You happy?

588
00:50:26,569 --> 00:50:30,118  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:452 Y2:535
Yes, I'm insensitive!
I'm a very insensitive man!

589
00:50:30,369 --> 00:50:35,523  X1:117 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:535
Stop! Look at the insensitive man!
That's why they pay you!

590
00:50:38,289 --> 00:50:39,881  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:500 Y2:535
He was my ride home.

591
00:50:42,049 --> 00:50:43,721  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:500 Y2:529
Understood.

592
00:50:46,769 --> 00:50:49,966  X1:217 X2:498 Y1:452 Y2:535
Why did you have to
see me so urgently?

593
00:50:50,209 --> 00:50:52,040  X1:136 X2:578 Y1:500 Y2:535
You couldn't come to my place?

594
00:50:52,289 --> 00:50:54,325  X1:227 X2:488 Y1:500 Y2:535
It's just safer here.

595
00:50:54,609 --> 00:50:56,918  X1:251 X2:463 Y1:500 Y2:529
What? Charlie.

596
00:50:59,649 --> 00:51:01,321  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:500 Y2:535
I'm sorry.

597
00:51:01,769 --> 00:51:04,329  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:500 Y2:535
I think you're a terrific woman.

598
00:51:05,609 --> 00:51:08,840  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:452 Y2:529
I just don't think we should
see each other.

599
00:51:11,729 --> 00:51:14,607  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:500 Y2:535
Why? And tell me the truth.

600
00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:19,841  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:529
I'm afraid that you're gonna k--
Leave me.

601
00:51:20,529 --> 00:51:22,724  X1:204 X2:512 Y1:500 Y2:535
I'm gonna cleave you?

602
00:51:23,209 --> 00:51:25,962  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:534
-What does that mean?
-No, leave me.

603
00:51:26,169 --> 00:51:27,921  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:500 Y2:535
That you'll reject me.

604
00:51:28,129 --> 00:51:32,042  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:452 Y2:535
So I just thought
I'd do a preemptive strike.

605
00:51:32,249 --> 00:51:34,968  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:500 Y2:535
So you're rejecting me?

606
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:38,118  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:500 Y2:535
I didn't mean to hurt you.

607
00:51:38,889 --> 00:51:41,119  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:500 Y2:535
I never wanted to hurt you.

608
00:51:43,529 --> 00:51:45,565  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:500 Y2:535
Don't worry, you haven't.

609
00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:47,925  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:500 Y2:535
At least you left early on.

610
00:51:51,529 --> 00:51:54,919  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:500 Y2:534
So that's it, then?

611
00:51:59,129 --> 00:52:01,723  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:500 Y2:535
Because I gotta get back to work.

612
00:52:43,129 --> 00:52:46,326  X1:297 X2:421 Y1:452 Y2:529
Woman
Woe man

613
00:52:46,529 --> 00:52:49,168  X1:289 X2:430 Y1:500 Y2:529
Whoa man

614
00:52:49,409 --> 00:52:52,799  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:529
We had love not just sex
ls she Mrs. X?

615
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:56,718  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:500 Y2:535
I had to run for my life

616
00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:09,322  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:500 Y2:535
Jane, get me off of this crazy thing

617
00:53:09,529 --> 00:53:11,326  X1:281 X2:436 Y1:500 Y2:529
Called love

618
00:53:46,449 --> 00:53:47,245  X1:318 X2:397 Y1:500 Y2:529
Hello!

619
00:53:47,449 --> 00:53:51,522  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:452 Y2:535
Not that it matters,
but I thought you'd like to know...

620
00:53:51,769 --> 00:53:54,078  X1:087 X2:628 Y1:500 Y2:535
...somebody admitted murdering Ralph.

621
00:53:54,289 --> 00:53:56,325  X1:196 X2:518 Y1:500 Y2:529
What about the others?

622
00:53:56,529 --> 00:53:58,645  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:500 Y2:535
She just confessed to the one.

623
00:53:58,889 --> 00:54:02,564  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:535
Anyway, crime to stop. Gotta go.
Catch you later.

624
00:54:22,689 --> 00:54:24,805  X1:243 X2:471 Y1:452 Y2:535
-It's me, Charlie.
-Go away.

625
00:54:25,049 --> 00:54:29,565  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:452 Y2:529
I gotta talk to you. I made a big
mistake. I'm an idiot.

626
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:31,720  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:500 Y2:535
I'll go into therapy, okay?

627
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:36,918  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:534
I'll go twice a week. I don't know
if insurance will cover it, but....

628
00:54:39,729 --> 00:54:40,957  X1:283 X2:432 Y1:500 Y2:529
What is it?

629
00:54:41,609 --> 00:54:43,327  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:500 Y2:534
Hi, Charlie.

630
00:54:53,529 --> 00:54:55,121  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:500 Y2:535
I don't want to lose you.

631
00:54:55,849 --> 00:54:57,567  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:500 Y2:535
You didn't. You rejected me.

632
00:54:57,769 --> 00:55:01,364  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:500 Y2:535
Okay, I'm un-rejecting you.

633
00:55:03,689 --> 00:55:07,238  X1:176 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:535
You'll do it again, Charlie.
You'll do it again.

634
00:55:07,609 --> 00:55:10,521  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:500 Y2:535
No, I'm not gonna do it again.

635
00:55:12,689 --> 00:55:15,157  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:500 Y2:535
Look, I got scared, okay?

636
00:55:15,409 --> 00:55:20,119  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:452 Y2:535
Things were going really good
and then I just got scared.

637
00:55:25,809 --> 00:55:27,401  X1:286 X2:429 Y1:500 Y2:535
I love you.

638
00:55:28,969 --> 00:55:31,119  X1:260 X2:456 Y1:500 Y2:535
I love you too.

639
00:55:36,209 --> 00:55:39,519  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:529
But you blew it, Charlie.
You blew it.

640
00:56:01,489 --> 00:56:04,242  X1:253 X2:464 Y1:500 Y2:534
Harriet, Harriet

641
00:56:04,449 --> 00:56:08,158  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:500 Y2:535
Hard-hearted harbinger of haggis

642
00:56:08,409 --> 00:56:11,640  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:500 Y2:534
Beautiful, bemusd

643
00:56:11,849 --> 00:56:14,761  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:500 Y2:529
Bellicose butcher

644
00:56:15,009 --> 00:56:17,921  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:500 Y2:535
Untrusting

645
00:56:18,329 --> 00:56:20,923  X1:283 X2:436 Y1:500 Y2:535
Unknowing

646
00:56:21,409 --> 00:56:24,367  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:500 Y2:529
Unlovd

647
00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:34,047  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:535
He wants you back
He screams into the night air

648
00:56:34,289 --> 00:56:38,328  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:452 Y2:529
Like a fireman going to a window
That has no fire

649
00:56:42,489 --> 00:56:45,686  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:500 Y2:535
Except the passion of his heart

650
00:56:46,209 --> 00:56:48,325  X1:282 X2:436 Y1:500 Y2:535
I am lonely

651
00:56:49,289 --> 00:56:51,723  X1:257 X2:462 Y1:500 Y2:535
It's really hard

652
00:56:52,769 --> 00:56:55,044  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:500 Y2:535
This poem sucks

653
00:57:34,609 --> 00:57:36,725  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:500 Y2:535
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.

654
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:41,520  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:452 Y2:535
Harriet, somebody's downstairs
to see you.

655
00:57:42,849 --> 00:57:47,525  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:452 Y2:535
She'll be down in a moment.
And could you bring the car around?

656
00:57:47,769 --> 00:57:49,680  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:500 Y2:535
Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

657
00:57:49,889 --> 00:57:53,359  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:535
Charlie, come here.
I want you to meet a friend.

658
00:57:53,569 --> 00:57:55,287  X1:262 X2:452 Y1:500 Y2:535
This is Ralph.

659
00:57:56,209 --> 00:57:59,724  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:500 Y2:535
Ralph? Ralph? This is Ralph?

660
00:58:00,049 --> 00:58:01,721  X1:258 X2:457 Y1:500 Y2:535
This is Ralph?

661
00:58:06,569 --> 00:58:07,888  X1:252 X2:462 Y1:500 Y2:529
This is Charlie.

662
00:58:08,369 --> 00:58:11,520  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Great to meet you.
-No, it's great to meet you.

663
00:58:11,729 --> 00:58:14,368  X1:187 X2:526 Y1:500 Y2:535
Yes, I love you so much.

664
00:58:14,569 --> 00:58:15,843  X1:297 X2:417 Y1:500 Y2:534
Oh, God!

665
00:58:19,409 --> 00:58:20,888  X1:226 X2:490 Y1:500 Y2:534
I'm naked, aren't l?

666
00:58:21,089 --> 00:58:25,207  X1:181 X2:532 Y1:500 Y2:535
Yes. Yes, you are naked.

667
00:58:34,249 --> 00:58:37,559  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:452 Y2:535
I was just naked then.
Very nude.

668
00:58:40,209 --> 00:58:43,645  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:500 Y2:535
Nice to meet you and call me?

669
00:58:43,849 --> 00:58:45,521  X1:321 X2:395 Y1:500 Y2:529
I will.

670
00:59:14,089 --> 00:59:15,158  X1:307 X2:407 Y1:500 Y2:529
Shut it!

671
00:59:19,209 --> 00:59:22,326  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:500 Y2:535
I'd like to propose a toast.

672
00:59:23,329 --> 00:59:25,524  X1:242 X2:472 Y1:500 Y2:535
To my wife, May.

673
00:59:27,129 --> 00:59:31,327  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:452 Y2:535
Thirty years ago today,
May and I were married.

674
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:35,084  X1:190 X2:524 Y1:452 Y2:529
Some of you were there.
Some weren't born.

675
00:59:35,289 --> 00:59:37,439  X1:140 X2:573 Y1:500 Y2:535
And some of you are now dead!

676
00:59:37,689 --> 00:59:42,763  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:535
But we both said, " I do," and we
haven't agreed on a thing since.

677
00:59:44,089 --> 00:59:45,920  X1:279 X2:436 Y1:500 Y2:529
That's true.

678
00:59:46,129 --> 00:59:48,359  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:500 Y2:535
But I'm glad I married you...

679
00:59:48,609 --> 00:59:51,806  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:500 Y2:529
...because it could have been worse.

680
00:59:54,729 --> 00:59:56,720  X1:258 X2:456 Y1:500 Y2:529
And besides...

681
00:59:57,569 --> 00:59:59,287  X1:242 X2:474 Y1:500 Y2:535
...l still love you.

682
01:00:07,449 --> 01:00:08,438  X1:282 X2:433 Y1:500 Y2:535
Thank you.

683
01:00:14,769 --> 01:00:17,920  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:500 Y2:535
Tony, would you like to dance?

684
01:00:21,169 --> 01:00:22,921  X1:275 X2:441 Y1:500 Y2:529
Let's dance.

685
01:00:29,929 --> 01:00:32,523  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:500 Y2:535
It must be a great feeling to have....

686
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:35,238  X1:284 X2:430 Y1:500 Y2:535
You okay?

687
01:00:35,489 --> 01:00:36,842  X1:279 X2:436 Y1:500 Y2:534
No, I'm not.

688
01:00:40,609 --> 01:00:42,167  X1:290 X2:426 Y1:500 Y2:535
Marry me.

689
01:00:43,929 --> 01:00:44,998  X1:335 X2:380 Y1:500 Y2:529
No.

690
01:00:47,329 --> 01:00:48,523  X1:304 X2:413 Y1:500 Y2:529
Please?

691
01:00:50,089 --> 01:00:51,841  X1:170 X2:544 Y1:500 Y2:535
Why not just live together?

692
01:00:52,089 --> 01:00:55,764  X1:164 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:535
We could live together first.
Let's just live together.

693
01:00:55,969 --> 01:00:59,166  X1:188 X2:526 Y1:452 Y2:535
Because I love you.
We should get married...

694
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:03,118  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:535
...and spend the next 30 years
of our life together.

695
01:01:03,329 --> 01:01:08,528  X1:098 X2:615 Y1:452 Y2:535
I want you to have my children.
And I want you to have your children.

696
01:01:08,729 --> 01:01:12,438  X1:181 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:534
That sounds like an awful
lot of children, but....

697
01:01:14,489 --> 01:01:15,808  X1:286 X2:429 Y1:500 Y2:535
I love you.

698
01:01:17,169 --> 01:01:18,921  X1:282 X2:433 Y1:500 Y2:535
I need you.

699
01:01:20,049 --> 01:01:22,722  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:500 Y2:535
Let's just get married. Okay?

700
01:01:23,169 --> 01:01:24,727  X1:297 X2:418 Y1:500 Y2:529
Harriet...

701
01:01:25,569 --> 01:01:26,763  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:500 Y2:535
...be my wife.

702
01:01:27,009 --> 01:01:30,285  X1:216 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:535
All right, everyone,
shut your cake hole!

703
01:01:30,889 --> 01:01:35,246  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:535
I'd like to make a toast
to my son, Charlie.

704
01:01:35,809 --> 01:01:38,403  X1:104 X2:610 Y1:500 Y2:535
Thanks for throwing this great party.

705
01:01:38,889 --> 01:01:42,768  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:452 Y2:535
I hope you have the same
great 30 years that we've had.

706
01:01:43,009 --> 01:01:45,125  X1:281 X2:432 Y1:500 Y2:529
To Charlie!

707
01:01:50,649 --> 01:01:52,128  X1:326 X2:387 Y1:500 Y2:529
Yes.

708
01:01:52,329 --> 01:01:53,318  X1:293 X2:422 Y1:500 Y2:529
You will?

709
01:01:53,569 --> 01:01:55,719  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:500 Y2:535
Let's get married, Charlie.

710
01:02:02,729 --> 01:02:06,961  X1:124 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:535
Now, Mr. MacKenzie, if you will
take this woman to be your wife...

711
01:02:07,209 --> 01:02:11,680  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:529
...through thick and thin,
for better or for worse...

712
01:02:11,889 --> 01:02:13,527  X1:222 X2:492 Y1:500 Y2:535
...please say " I do."

713
01:02:14,249 --> 01:02:15,318  X1:328 X2:388 Y1:500 Y2:529
I do.

714
01:02:15,569 --> 01:02:20,199  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:535
Now, Harriet, if you will take this
man through good times and bad...

715
01:02:20,449 --> 01:02:25,318  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:452 Y2:535
...forever and ever as your
husband, please say " I do."

716
01:02:39,049 --> 01:02:40,323  X1:328 X2:388 Y1:500 Y2:529
I do.

717
01:02:41,969 --> 01:02:45,405  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:529
Now, Charlie,
kiss the beautiful bride.

718
01:03:09,169 --> 01:03:12,127  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:500 Y2:535
Let's get pissed!

719
01:03:49,289 --> 01:03:51,120  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:500 Y2:535
Hang a solo!

720
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:15,325  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:452 Y2:535
We have a piper who's down.
It's all right, he's just pissed.

721
01:04:15,529 --> 01:04:19,761  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:535
We have a piper down.
I repeat, a piper is down.

722
01:04:24,009 --> 01:04:26,079  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:500 Y2:535
This is such a great party.

723
01:04:26,409 --> 01:04:28,240  X1:161 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:535
-It is.
-The marriage was beautiful.

724
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:29,638  X1:267 X2:447 Y1:452 Y2:535
-It was.
-It was great.

725
01:04:29,889 --> 01:04:32,164  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:500 Y2:535
Yeah. She's great, isn't she?

726
01:04:32,409 --> 01:04:34,604  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:500 Y2:529
She's the best. She's incredible.

727
01:04:34,849 --> 01:04:38,524  X1:160 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:535
You've been such a chicken,
and finally, you met the one.

728
01:04:38,769 --> 01:04:40,964  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:452 Y2:529
How could you think
she was a killer?

729
01:04:58,009 --> 01:05:02,525  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:535
Come here, Charlie.
Come stand by me, Charlie.

730
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:16,764  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:452 Y2:529
Wait till you see this place.
It's called Poets' Corner.

731
01:06:17,009 --> 01:06:19,477  X1:197 X2:516 Y1:452 Y2:535
A lot of the Beat
poets used to go there.

732
01:06:27,329 --> 01:06:28,728  X1:225 X2:489 Y1:500 Y2:535
You're really quiet.

733
01:06:29,769 --> 01:06:32,203  X1:213 X2:501 Y1:500 Y2:535
Oh, I'm just thinking.

734
01:06:32,449 --> 01:06:34,280  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:500 Y2:535
Oh, okay. Well....

735
01:06:34,689 --> 01:06:38,477  X1:180 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:535
Why don't I do the talking
for you, all right?

736
01:06:38,689 --> 01:06:40,566  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:500 Y2:535
Hi, my name is Harriet.

737
01:06:40,809 --> 01:06:44,722  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:535
Hi, Harriet. How's it going?
Good, good, I suppose.

738
01:06:44,929 --> 01:06:48,365  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:535
I think you're great, Charlie.
Everything you do is art.

739
01:06:48,609 --> 01:06:53,000  X1:087 X2:627 Y1:452 Y2:529
You're a sex machine.
Get on the scene with the sex machine.

740
01:06:53,249 --> 01:06:57,800  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:452 Y2:529
Thank you very much.
You're the best husband I ever had--

741
01:06:58,049 --> 01:07:00,199  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:500 Y2:535
Why did you just say that?

742
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:02,208  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:500 Y2:535
It was a joke.

743
01:07:02,449 --> 01:07:04,565  X1:221 X2:494 Y1:500 Y2:535
Why did you say it?

744
01:07:04,809 --> 01:07:06,527  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:500 Y2:535
I thought it might be funny.

745
01:07:06,729 --> 01:07:10,324  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:452 Y2:535
Nothing, I just think you're
a great person. That's all.

746
01:07:11,369 --> 01:07:12,643  X1:314 X2:401 Y1:500 Y2:529
What?

747
01:07:13,209 --> 01:07:17,088  X1:194 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:534
-You're the best.
-No, no, no! Watch out!

748
01:07:25,729 --> 01:07:28,641  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:535
I hear you've been working
the Ralph Elliot case.

749
01:07:29,209 --> 01:07:31,359  X1:245 X2:470 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Yes, captain.
-Don't "yes" me.

750
01:07:31,729 --> 01:07:33,526  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:500 Y2:535
This is strictly homicide.

751
01:07:33,929 --> 01:07:35,123  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:500 Y2:535
I got a friend--

752
01:07:35,329 --> 01:07:38,401  X1:188 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:535
We all got these friends.
I'm warning you.

753
01:07:38,809 --> 01:07:42,722  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:452 Y2:535
Back off, ltalian boy. Keep
away from this. It's too big.

754
01:07:43,689 --> 01:07:44,963  X1:258 X2:455 Y1:500 Y2:529
Wait a minute.

755
01:07:45,369 --> 01:07:49,328  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:452 Y2:535
Trust me. I know what I'm
talking about. What's the news?

756
01:07:49,529 --> 01:07:52,248  X1:192 X2:522 Y1:452 Y2:529
You want to hear news?
Here's the news.

757
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:55,606  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:452 Y2:529
The lady that confessed
to Elliot's murder has...

758
01:07:55,849 --> 01:07:57,328  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:500 Y2:529
...confessed to other crimes.

759
01:07:57,569 --> 01:07:58,718  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:500 Y2:529
I knew she would.

760
01:07:58,969 --> 01:08:01,324  X1:100 X2:614 Y1:500 Y2:529
To the murders of Abraham Lincoln...

761
01:08:01,569 --> 01:08:05,562  X1:106 X2:608 Y1:452 Y2:529
...Warren G. Harding,
and Julius Caesar. She's a nutcase.

762
01:08:05,809 --> 01:08:08,004  X1:193 X2:521 Y1:500 Y2:535
Oh, my God! I gotta go.

763
01:08:10,009 --> 01:08:14,844  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:452 Y2:535
Screw this up, and you'll
be writing parking tickets forever.

764
01:08:15,849 --> 01:08:19,285  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:500 Y2:535
Captain, I won't let you down.

765
01:08:24,569 --> 01:08:26,719  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:500 Y2:535
Good for you. That was better.

766
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:28,721  X1:243 X2:472 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Yeah?
-It was fantastic.

767
01:08:28,969 --> 01:08:31,358  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:452 Y2:535
-The beginning felt good.
-It was great.

768
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:32,962  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:500 Y2:529
Too much in the end.

769
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:34,528  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:500 Y2:534
No, it was terrific.

770
01:08:34,769 --> 01:08:37,647  X1:212 X2:502 Y1:452 Y2:529
-I need to save a life.
-I'll work on it.

771
01:08:37,889 --> 01:08:39,607  X1:180 X2:533 Y1:500 Y2:534
Work on it, it was terrific.

772
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:41,601  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:500 Y2:535
It was a big improvement.

773
01:08:41,849 --> 01:08:43,077  X1:303 X2:411 Y1:500 Y2:529
Thanks.

774
01:09:02,329 --> 01:09:04,479  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:500 Y2:535
That is Ralph Elliot's wife.

775
01:09:04,689 --> 01:09:07,999  X1:195 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:529
Of course her hair
was much shorter then.

776
01:09:09,609 --> 01:09:12,123  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:500 Y2:535
She's gained weight since then...

777
01:09:12,329 --> 01:09:14,968  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:500 Y2:535
...but it's definitely her.

778
01:09:15,169 --> 01:09:18,844  X1:185 X2:528 Y1:452 Y2:535
Yeah, that's her. He was
really in love with her...

779
01:09:19,089 --> 01:09:22,877  X1:162 X2:552 Y1:452 Y2:529
...but I tell you, she was fun,
and smart. Doll-face too.

780
01:09:38,009 --> 01:09:39,840  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:500 Y2:535
Thank you very much.

781
01:09:43,609 --> 01:09:45,201  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:500 Y2:535
This is really cool.

782
01:09:46,729 --> 01:09:47,923  X1:339 X2:376 Y1:500 Y2:529
Hi.

783
01:09:48,569 --> 01:09:51,129  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:535
Mr. and Mrs. MacKenzie,
enjoy your honeymoon.

784
01:09:51,369 --> 01:09:54,008  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:529
When you leave, it'll be
far too soon.

785
01:09:54,289 --> 01:09:55,517  X1:271 X2:444 Y1:500 Y2:535
That's great.

786
01:09:56,369 --> 01:09:59,998  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:529
Four nights. Your dinner
reservations are at 9:00.

787
01:10:00,249 --> 01:10:01,125  X1:261 X2:453 Y1:500 Y2:535
Sounds great.

788
01:10:01,369 --> 01:10:04,759  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:452 Y2:535
Put candles by the bed.
With a storm, we lose power.

789
01:10:05,009 --> 01:10:07,603  X1:215 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:529
That's cool. Did you
hear that? A storm.

790
01:10:07,849 --> 01:10:10,568  X1:217 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:535
A storm. We'll be
snugly inside and....

791
01:10:11,729 --> 01:10:12,798  X1:284 X2:430 Y1:500 Y2:535
You okay?

792
01:10:14,889 --> 01:10:19,758  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:452 Y2:535
I have a headache.
Excuse me, do you have a drugstore?

793
01:10:19,969 --> 01:10:23,757  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:452 Y2:535
-I need aspirin.
-Up the stairs, Mrs. MacKenzie.

794
01:10:25,809 --> 01:10:27,527  X1:277 X2:439 Y1:500 Y2:529
Don't move.

795
01:10:31,729 --> 01:10:33,924  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:452 Y2:529
-You think she has a headache?
-What?

796
01:10:34,169 --> 01:10:37,605  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:529
Nothing. Here's your key.
The Robbie Burns room.

797
01:10:37,849 --> 01:10:39,840  X1:194 X2:520 Y1:500 Y2:535
Oh, thanks. Thank you.

798
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:49,446  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:452 Y2:535
-The circuits are down.
-Keep on trying.

799
01:10:49,689 --> 01:10:52,806  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:500 Y2:535
Tell the chief I chartered a plane.

800
01:10:54,969 --> 01:10:57,039  X1:267 X2:447 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Hey, paisan!
-What?

801
01:10:57,289 --> 01:11:00,964  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:452 Y2:535
Screw up, I'll kick your
spaghetti butt back to Milan.

802
01:11:01,209 --> 01:11:02,642  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:500 Y2:529
Not now. Not now.

803
01:11:02,889 --> 01:11:06,598  X1:169 X2:544 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Too many ethnic slurs?
-It's not paisan, it's paisan.

804
01:11:08,609 --> 01:11:10,167  X1:267 X2:447 Y1:500 Y2:535
Hey! Paisan.

805
01:11:41,289 --> 01:11:44,599  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:535
How long is it gonna
take us to get there?

806
01:11:44,849 --> 01:11:47,841  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:500 Y2:535
It shouldn't take very long.

807
01:11:49,289 --> 01:11:51,928  X1:112 X2:601 Y1:500 Y2:535
Actually, I have no concept of time.

808
01:11:53,689 --> 01:11:55,327  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:500 Y2:535
Jesus, is this dangerous?

809
01:11:55,529 --> 01:11:59,841  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:452 Y2:535
No. Well, there's
chance in everything.

810
01:12:01,409 --> 01:12:03,798  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:500 Y2:535
You've done this before, right?

811
01:12:04,049 --> 01:12:07,928  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:452 Y2:529
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I do this all the time.

812
01:12:08,129 --> 01:12:10,802  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:500 Y2:535
I've never done it at night.

813
01:12:25,489 --> 01:12:27,844  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:535
Mr. and Mrs. MacKenzie,
glad to see you.

814
01:12:29,009 --> 01:12:29,998  X1:284 X2:431 Y1:500 Y2:529
Follow me.

815
01:12:41,409 --> 01:12:43,525  X1:216 X2:498 Y1:452 Y2:535
How do you know
where you're going?

816
01:12:43,729 --> 01:12:45,560  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:500 Y2:529
Instruments. Instruments.

817
01:12:45,809 --> 01:12:48,164  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:500 Y2:535
Oh, yeah? Yeah? What's that?

818
01:12:48,889 --> 01:12:53,599  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:529
That's the artificial horizon, which
is better than the actual horizon.

819
01:12:55,689 --> 01:13:00,319  X1:099 X2:614 Y1:452 Y2:535
You know, I'm gonna wash my hands.
All right? I love you.

820
01:13:24,209 --> 01:13:25,403  X1:258 X2:456 Y1:500 Y2:535
Good evening.

821
01:13:46,209 --> 01:13:47,801  X1:293 X2:419 Y1:500 Y2:535
Wake up!

822
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:51,803  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:535
Oh, man, I was having
an amazing dream.

823
01:13:52,049 --> 01:13:54,768  X1:158 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:535
I don't care about
your dream! Land the plane!

824
01:13:57,329 --> 01:14:01,925  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:535
I was just born, and I was
eight-and-a-half months premature.

825
01:14:02,169 --> 01:14:04,763  X1:141 X2:572 Y1:452 Y2:535
-The doctors were freaking out.
-Shut up.

826
01:14:05,009 --> 01:14:07,125  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:500 Y2:535
Did I already tell you this dream?

827
01:14:09,409 --> 01:14:13,197  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:452 Y2:529
Can I have your attention?
I have a few announcements.

828
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:16,168  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:535
Celebrating their 25th
anniversary tonight...

829
01:14:16,449 --> 01:14:18,838  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:500 Y2:535
...Mr. and Mrs. Seymour Levenstein.

830
01:14:19,089 --> 01:14:21,205  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:500 Y2:529
How about a hand for them?

831
01:14:22,009 --> 01:14:23,408  X1:205 X2:509 Y1:500 Y2:535
Thank you, thank you.

832
01:14:23,689 --> 01:14:26,442  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:452 Y2:535
Twenty-five years ago,
they were here.

833
01:14:26,689 --> 01:14:30,728  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:529
Speaking of new couples,
Charlie and Harriet MacKenzie.

834
01:14:30,969 --> 01:14:34,405  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:452 Y2:535
-They look great.
-There's a phone call for you.

835
01:14:34,769 --> 01:14:36,043  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:500 Y2:535
It is quite urgent.

836
01:14:36,289 --> 01:14:40,521  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:500 Y2:535
Oh, thank you. Sorry. Hello.

837
01:14:40,769 --> 01:14:44,364  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Charlie, you okay?
-Couldn't be better.

838
01:14:44,609 --> 01:14:47,806  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:529
Charlie, listen to me.
Harriet is Mrs. X.

839
01:14:48,209 --> 01:14:50,928  X1:209 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:535
She killed those men.
I got a picture.

840
01:14:51,209 --> 01:14:54,167  X1:221 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:529
It's her, Charlie.
She's the murderer.

841
01:14:54,369 --> 01:14:56,644  X1:230 X2:484 Y1:452 Y2:529
I called the police.
It'll take a while.

842
01:14:57,169 --> 01:14:58,921  X1:188 X2:525 Y1:500 Y2:535
Just stay where you are.

843
01:15:00,689 --> 01:15:01,917  X1:300 X2:416 Y1:500 Y2:529
Charlie?

844
01:15:02,129 --> 01:15:04,962  X1:084 X2:632 Y1:500 Y2:529
Hold on one second. What should I do?

845
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:07,245  X1:205 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:535
When the time comes,
you'll know.

846
01:15:07,489 --> 01:15:09,559  X1:227 X2:488 Y1:500 Y2:535
Thanks, thank you.

847
01:15:12,289 --> 01:15:14,007  X1:223 X2:491 Y1:500 Y2:534
Hello, hello, hello?!

848
01:15:15,209 --> 01:15:18,281  X1:228 X2:486 Y1:500 Y2:529
Charlie? Charlie?!

849
01:15:18,529 --> 01:15:20,087  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Hello!
-What happened?

850
01:15:20,329 --> 01:15:22,843  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:535
The phone died!
I was talking, and it died.

851
01:15:23,129 --> 01:15:26,804  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:452 Y2:529
It's common.
It will be out until tomorrow.

852
01:15:27,369 --> 01:15:28,597  X1:243 X2:472 Y1:500 Y2:535
What happened?

853
01:15:28,849 --> 01:15:31,363  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:500 Y2:535
Nothing. The phone lines went dead.

854
01:15:31,609 --> 01:15:33,759  X1:127 X2:586 Y1:500 Y2:535
We wish a long and beautiful life.

855
01:15:34,009 --> 01:15:37,684  X1:184 X2:530 Y1:452 Y2:535
We want to play
The Platters, "Only You."

856
01:15:39,769 --> 01:15:43,808  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:535
You can't go. You have
to wait for the wedding dance.

857
01:15:44,049 --> 01:15:46,404  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:500 Y2:535
We got a lot of traditions here.

858
01:15:53,409 --> 01:15:57,925  X1:123 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:535
Stop! Excuse me. I'm with the
San Francisco Police Department.

859
01:15:58,169 --> 01:16:01,127  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:500 Y2:529
I need to commandeer this vehicle.

860
01:16:03,169 --> 01:16:04,158  X1:335 X2:380 Y1:500 Y2:529
No.

861
01:16:04,409 --> 01:16:05,728  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:500 Y2:535
What do you mean, " No"?

862
01:16:05,929 --> 01:16:10,445  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:535
I know you don't have the right
to commandeer my vehicle.

863
01:16:11,089 --> 01:16:13,364  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:500 Y2:534
Please, can I commandeer this vehicle?

864
01:16:15,089 --> 01:16:16,078  X1:335 X2:380 Y1:500 Y2:529
No.

865
01:16:17,169 --> 01:16:20,002  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:452 Y2:535
You're not gonna bend
on this thing, are you?

866
01:16:21,689 --> 01:16:22,678  X1:335 X2:380 Y1:500 Y2:529
No.

867
01:16:26,809 --> 01:16:28,367  X1:283 X2:431 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Please.
-Go ahead.

868
01:16:28,609 --> 01:16:30,759  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:500 Y2:534
No, I don't want to. Charlie.

869
01:16:44,369 --> 01:16:46,200  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:500 Y2:535
Help me! I've married a...

870
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:51,808  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:452 Y2:529
...wonderful person who I love
and adore. Who I want--

871
01:16:52,049 --> 01:16:54,165  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:500 Y2:535
They've had enough of this crowd.

872
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:56,400  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:500 Y2:535
They have better things to do.

873
01:16:56,609 --> 01:16:59,248  X1:089 X2:626 Y1:500 Y2:535
Let's put them in the honeymoon chair.

874
01:17:04,009 --> 01:17:07,126  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:452 Y2:535
-We did it on our honeymoon.
-It's just fun.

875
01:17:09,329 --> 01:17:11,763  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:500 Y2:535
No, I haven't had my dessert yet.

876
01:17:14,249 --> 01:17:16,763  X1:173 X2:540 Y1:500 Y2:529
To the room! To the room!

877
01:17:30,289 --> 01:17:31,847  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:500 Y2:535
Have a good night.

878
01:17:33,609 --> 01:17:35,167  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:500 Y2:535
Stay for a nightcap?

879
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:37,406  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:500 Y2:529
No. You two want to be alone.

880
01:17:37,609 --> 01:17:40,328  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:500 Y2:535
No, really. Stay for a nightcap.

881
01:17:40,569 --> 01:17:42,161  X1:237 X2:478 Y1:500 Y2:535
I really shouldn't.

882
01:17:44,169 --> 01:17:46,285  X1:221 X2:492 Y1:500 Y2:535
Stay for a nightcap!

883
01:17:55,089 --> 01:17:59,640  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:452 Y2:535
Charlie, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

884
01:18:00,529 --> 01:18:01,678  X1:266 X2:450 Y1:500 Y2:534
Harriet, l, l....

885
01:18:02,409 --> 01:18:06,766  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:500 Y2:534
Charlie, I've been married before.

886
01:18:07,089 --> 01:18:11,128  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Harriet, I already know that.
-You know about my husbands?

887
01:18:11,369 --> 01:18:12,927  X1:326 X2:387 Y1:500 Y2:529
Yes.

888
01:18:13,729 --> 01:18:16,038  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Stay away from me!
-What are you doing?

889
01:18:16,249 --> 01:18:18,126  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:500 Y2:535
Come on. Stay away from me.

890
01:18:18,369 --> 01:18:21,167  X1:204 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:529
You don't understand.
Give me the axe!

891
01:18:22,409 --> 01:18:24,081  X1:276 X2:437 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Don't go!
-Get off me!

892
01:18:24,689 --> 01:18:26,759  X1:226 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Charlie! Don't go!
-Get off!

893
01:18:38,409 --> 01:18:41,003  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:500 Y2:535
Would you mind not doing that?

894
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:42,648  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:500 Y2:535
This bothers you?

895
01:18:42,889 --> 01:18:46,802  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:500 Y2:535
No, it's one of my favourite things.

896
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:54,245  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:500 Y2:535
Don't go! Charlie! Charlie!

897
01:18:58,809 --> 01:19:00,925  X1:256 X2:458 Y1:500 Y2:529
Hello? Hello?!

898
01:19:06,729 --> 01:19:10,244  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:452 Y2:529
" Dear Harriet. I just can't
handle the commitment.

899
01:19:11,409 --> 01:19:15,004  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:500 Y2:535
It's too hard. I'm leaving you.

900
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:18,326  X1:237 X2:479 Y1:452 Y2:529
Love, Charlie"?
I didn't write this.

901
01:19:19,449 --> 01:19:21,121  X1:249 X2:464 Y1:500 Y2:529
What the fuck?!

902
01:19:21,409 --> 01:19:22,728  X1:319 X2:396 Y1:500 Y2:529
Rose!

903
01:19:22,929 --> 01:19:25,238  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:535
What's happening?!
Charlie, open the door!

904
01:19:25,489 --> 01:19:27,480  X1:208 X2:506 Y1:452 Y2:529
-Rose tried to kill me.
-What?

905
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:30,448  X1:173 X2:540 Y1:500 Y2:535
Shut up! I wrote this note!

906
01:19:30,689 --> 01:19:32,725  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:500 Y2:529
You're not to be here when...

907
01:19:32,929 --> 01:19:35,966  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:452 Y2:535
...this note has been
placed on the desk!

908
01:19:36,209 --> 01:19:40,122  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:535
Do you understand me? You
took her away from me, Charlie.

909
01:19:40,329 --> 01:19:41,523  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:500 Y2:529
Like all the rest.

910
01:19:41,809 --> 01:19:43,322  X1:268 X2:446 Y1:500 Y2:529
I have had it!

911
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:48,966  X1:212 X2:501 Y1:500 Y2:535
You are going to die.

912
01:19:52,209 --> 01:19:53,722  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:500 Y2:535
Would you mind waiting?

913
01:19:53,969 --> 01:19:56,722  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:535
I may need you to
help if I make an arrest.

914
01:19:57,129 --> 01:19:58,528  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:500 Y2:529
I'll need a ride--

915
01:19:58,729 --> 01:20:00,799  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:500 Y2:535
Shucks. Thank you.

916
01:20:02,689 --> 01:20:06,648  X1:210 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:534
What are you doing?!
Charlie, be careful.

917
01:20:14,529 --> 01:20:16,087  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:500 Y2:534
Run, Charlie!

918
01:20:16,689 --> 01:20:20,443  X1:187 X2:526 Y1:452 Y2:535
Stop it! Stop this, Rose!
Help!

919
01:20:20,929 --> 01:20:22,965  X1:236 X2:478 Y1:500 Y2:535
Somebody! Help!

920
01:20:25,809 --> 01:20:27,128  X1:304 X2:411 Y1:500 Y2:529
Charlie!

921
01:20:31,169 --> 01:20:34,639  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:500 Y2:535
Is that you? Help! Hurry.

922
01:20:46,889 --> 01:20:49,847  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:529
Hurry! I'm in here!
Who is it?!

923
01:20:50,409 --> 01:20:53,003  X1:218 X2:496 Y1:452 Y2:529
Help! Who's there?!
Charlie?!

924
01:20:55,089 --> 01:20:58,968  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:535
I'm in the closet. Come here.
Tony! Open the closet.

925
01:21:01,329 --> 01:21:03,240  X1:304 X2:411 Y1:500 Y2:529
Charlie!

926
01:21:10,209 --> 01:21:11,528  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:500 Y2:535
Where are you going?

927
01:21:11,769 --> 01:21:15,159  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:452 Y2:529
We gotta go on the roof.
Charlie and Rose are on the roof.

928
01:21:15,369 --> 01:21:16,518  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:500 Y2:529
Charlie's on the roof!

929
01:21:16,769 --> 01:21:18,646  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:452 Y2:535
-What're you doing?
-Shut up!

930
01:21:59,609 --> 01:22:01,918  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:500 Y2:535
Let's just take this down a notch.

931
01:22:03,929 --> 01:22:07,717  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:452 Y2:535
What you're saying is that
Rose killed your husbands...

932
01:22:07,969 --> 01:22:10,802  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:452 Y2:535
...forged notes to make you
think they left?

933
01:22:11,049 --> 01:22:15,804  X1:189 X2:524 Y1:452 Y2:535
Yes. Listen, that's them
up on the roof. Listen!

934
01:22:17,009 --> 01:22:19,079  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:500 Y2:535
You don't get it, do you?

935
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:25,248  X1:166 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:529
We can talk here, or we can
talk about it downtown.

936
01:23:22,689 --> 01:23:25,044  X1:192 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:535
-Charlie, I'm coming up!
-Hang on!

937
01:23:26,929 --> 01:23:28,442  X1:304 X2:411 Y1:500 Y2:529
Charlie.

938
01:23:39,969 --> 01:23:41,766  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:500 Y2:534
Charlie, be careful!

939
01:24:13,689 --> 01:24:14,678  X1:319 X2:396 Y1:500 Y2:529
Rose!

940
01:24:29,529 --> 01:24:30,723  X1:207 X2:506 Y1:500 Y2:535
San Francisco police!

941
01:24:33,129 --> 01:24:35,199  X1:165 X2:549 Y1:500 Y2:535
I got her, Charlie. I got her!

942
01:24:37,169 --> 01:24:39,125  X1:244 X2:470 Y1:500 Y2:529
Don't let me fall!

943
01:24:39,929 --> 01:24:40,918  X1:288 X2:426 Y1:500 Y2:535
Oh, sorry.

944
01:25:00,809 --> 01:25:03,118  X1:265 X2:454 Y1:500 Y2:535
rose, jailbird

945
01:25:04,889 --> 01:25:08,598  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:452 Y2:535
Happy in her cage
No longer full of rage

946
01:25:08,849 --> 01:25:10,248  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:500 Y2:529
She roosts

947
01:25:16,009 --> 01:25:19,524  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:500 Y2:534
Harriet, sweet Harriet

948
01:25:20,009 --> 01:25:21,442  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:500 Y2:529
You acted cuckoo

949
01:25:21,689 --> 01:25:25,318  X1:103 X2:617 Y1:452 Y2:529
'Cause you thought I would leave you
Sweet bird

950
01:25:31,609 --> 01:25:34,362  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:500 Y2:534
Harriet, sweet Harriet

951
01:25:35,929 --> 01:25:40,525  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:500 Y2:535
So knowing, so trusting

952
01:25:41,329 --> 01:25:43,638  X1:297 X2:421 Y1:500 Y2:529
So lovd

953
01:25:48,609 --> 01:25:52,488  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:500 Y2:534
Harriet, sweet Harriet
