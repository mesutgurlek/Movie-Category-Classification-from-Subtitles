I can't really read music.

can't read the sign that says "toilet"...

Oh, snap.
Now you can see me?

01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:24,913
Look, I panicked.

984
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,332

all that crap about...

985

that started the fight," and I just—

01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:33,421
Devon, I'm— I'm sorry.

987
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:36,383
It ain't about your parents.

You left me hanging.

01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:46,476
No? Let me show you.

01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:54,150
Dr. Lee? Dr. Lee.

992
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:56,152
I just wanted to catch
you before rehearsal.

993
01:16:56,237 --> 01:16:59,739
I was thinkin' that instead of promoting
a P2 to replace Devon...

994
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:02,826
we might just keep
the snare line at nine.

995
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:05,912
And how long have you
been thinking that?

996
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:08,164
Just this mornin'.

997
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:10,750
Are you sure?

998
01:17:10,835 --> 01:17:13,920
I thought maybe it was the day
you showed us all he couldn't read...

999
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:17,006
or maybe it was the night
he took your solo.

1000
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:19,509
I don't know.

1001
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:21,636
But since you heard him play...

1002
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:26,683
you decided that the line,
or perhaps maybe just you...

1003
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,977
would be better off without him.

1004
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:35,150
Remember when I first
made you section leader?

1005
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:40,238
You were sweatin' bullets
wondering how you could lead...

1006
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:44,075
this loud, passionate group
of your peers...

1007
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,745
and I said you would be fine.

1008
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:49,456
Remember why?

1009
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,624
You said I loved
the sound of the line...

1010
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,668
more than the sound
of my own drum.

1011
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:58,006
Yes. And you've lost
sight of that...

1012
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,633
and that's okay because...

1013
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:04,763
we all lose sight
of things sometimes.

1014
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:07,766
But if you don't get it together,
Mr. Taylor...

1015
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:10,143
you're gonna have
a difficult time leading the senate...

1016
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:13,730
