1
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,677
- "Nigel"?
- No.

2
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,711
"Leonard." That's cute.

3
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:33,583
That's so cute! We have a little fat kid
that likes internet porn.

4
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,350
Let's come up with our own name.
We don't need the book.

5
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,017
Like "Apple"
or "Destiny's Child."

6
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:42,221
I'll tell you what...

7
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,230
Honey, will you run in the kitchen
and get me my toast?

8
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,822
- Yes.
- Thank you.

9
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,427
The book says it's important
to have a name for the child

10
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,936
<i>before the child is born.</i>

11
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,530
Oh, that book.
You've got to relax with that book.

12
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,665
You're obsessed.

13
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,197
Honey, you know
doing research

14
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,039
makes me feel
more comfortable.

15
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:01,103
Speaking of which,
I've decided not to do an epidural.

16
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,546
- What?
- <i>Yep.</i>

17
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,210
Apparently, natural childbirth's
better for the baby.

18
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,687
But everybody says
the pain is unbearable.

19
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,814
I'm a tough girl.
I can handle it.

20
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,325
Whatever is best
for baby Big Nose.

21
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,849
Big Nose?

22
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,260
Oh, sorry, that's just the name
that popped into my head

23
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,855
when I was looking
at you.

24
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:22,265
Oh, that's very funny.
That's very funny.

25
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,770
Honey, please!

26
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,772
You're going
to make me pee!

27
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:30,367
Whoa, whoa.
Look at the time. I gotta go.

28
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,005
- Promotion day.
- Good luck, sweetheart.

29
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,107
- Hey. I love you.
- I love you more.

30
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:45,150
Tom! Tom!
Tom Reilly.

31
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,625
How the hell are you, man?
What's going on?

32
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,184
Good, Forrest.
How are you?

33
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,323
The last time I saw you,
you were with Sofia Kowalski.

34
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,560
Yeah, we got married actually.

35
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,898
Way to go, man.

36
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,994
You know, I was never one
of the people that said

37
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,198
she was out of your league.
In their face, right?

38
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,208
Yeah.

39
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,733
- We're about to have a baby.
- Congratulations. That's fantastic.

40
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,871
Yeah, good stuff. My wife and I
just did that deal in December.

41
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,905
Kids are expensive
as hell, though.

42
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,849
I just made SVP
at Armstrong.

43
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,717
Making 500 grand a year
and we're barely making ends meet.

44
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,450
We just got a beach house
in the Hamptons.

45
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,788
- Oh.
- Piece of advice--

46
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,192
you want
the most blowjobs ever?

47
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,095
- Please.
- Get your wife a beach house.

48
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:28,692
- Oh.
- I'm serious. I can't keep her off my junk.

49
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,396
I'll have
to remember that.

50
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,768
Hey, come out to the Hamptons sometime.
We'll go sailing.

51
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,399
- I'll bring my yacht!
- Even better.

52
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:39,172
$500,000 a year.
Can you believe that?

53
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,975
I went to school
with this idiot.

54
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,778
He's one of the stupidest
people I ever met.

55
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,374
Where did I go wrong?

56
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,046
- Dude, you're a cook.
- I know.

57
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,021
I should have become
a hedge-fund guy.

58
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:53,389
I'd be getting BJs
out in East Hampton.

59
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:57,294
Okay, people!
A lot of hungry stockbrokers up there.

60
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,423
They're counting on you.

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,195
What's wrong?

62
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,227
Somebody left a bunch
of salmon out overnight.

63
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,102
Leon's docking
everybody's pay.

64
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,132
- That's ridiculous.
- You gotta talk to him, Tom.

65
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:13,475
No, no, no, no, no,
not me this time, guys. Sorry.

66
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,811
Tommy, you're the only
guy that can stand up to him.

67
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,214
Paco, my wife's about
to have a baby. I need this promotion.

68
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,151
This guy's going
to dock our pay, man.

69
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,518
Let's go, ladies!

70
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,080
I don't pay you
to stand around all day.

71
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,092
Hey, Summers, I need you
to work on Sunday, okay?

72
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,356
Leon, my sister's getting married
on Sunday, remember?

73
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,727
Well, you know what? You gotta tell me
that when I'm making out the schedule.

74
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,289
- I can't keep track of everyone's social life.
- I did tell you.

75
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,894
- I'll sub for him, Leon.
- Paco, <i>silencio</i>.

76
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:39,769
Summers, I'm sorry.
You got to be here Sunday.

77
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,502
That's it.
I don't make the rules.

78
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,533
Oh, wait.
Yes, I do.

79
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,939
You got something to say, Reilly?
I'd love to hear it.

80
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,576
Leon,
you're an asshole.

81
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,518
And you're fired.

82
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,522
- What?
- <i>Adios, mijo.</i>

83
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,354
You heard me, Banderas.
Hit the road.

84
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,225
Go on back to your 10-family shack
and watch Telemundo all day.

85
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,956
I don't give a shit,
all right?

86
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,395
Okay, we both got
a little carried away.

87
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,405
I admit it.
You admit it.

88
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,839
Let's just have a cool-down period, okay?
Do you want to use my apron?

89
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,309
I can get most
of that off.

90
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,873
Are you kidding me? You don't
hit a guy with a pork chop!

91
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,988
- Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
- Come on!

92
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:36,586
- We're sorry. We're sorry. We're sorry.
- You're fired too.

93
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,002
Uh-huh!

94
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,339
Forrest, here's some pork,
on the house.

95
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,046
How's the ahi?

96
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,818
<i>Oh, I'm so fat.</i>

97
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:15,325
<i>Don't give me that crazy look, Kimmy.</i>
<i>I see you.</i>

98
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,859
I have too much to do
before I gotta get out of here.

99
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,599
<i>Hey, Sof',</i>
<i>can I ask you something?</i>

100
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,437
Do you really think you can
raise a kid on Tom's salary?

101
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,739
He's getting promoted
to head lunch-chef.

102
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,506
We're gonna be fine.

103
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,071
I have to say, I have a hard time
seeing you as a housewife.

104
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,912
I am not going to
be a housewife.

105
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,941
I'm going to be
a full-time mom.

106
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,044
Of course, yeah.

107
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,053
What?

108
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,858
Don't worry about it, man.

109
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,296
Hello.

110
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:49,096
Now?

111
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,263
It's a setback, baby,
but we're gonna get through this.

112
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,671
The important thing
is that we have

113
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,540
a beautiful, perfect,
handsome baby boy, right?

114
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,344
And we love each other.

115
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:04,906
<i>Right?</i>

116
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,218
Do you remember how we decided
that I was gonna stay home with our baby

117
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,224
and you were gonna
support us?

118
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,988
Sofia, it was the principle of the thing.
You should have seen this guy.

119
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,790
It's always
"the principle of the thing."

120
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,797
<i>First, it was</i>
<i>the museum job,</i>

121
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,493
<i>but then you didn't want to turn into</i>
<i>a pretentious social climber.</i>

122
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,899
Then you become
a magazine writer,

123
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,800
which lasts until you tell
your editor he's a whore.

124
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,000
Not an actual whore, Sofia.
A whore to the entertainment industry.

125
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,975
You speak your mind and you can
smell bullshit a mile away,

126
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,841
and that's what
I love about you,

127
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,847
but sooner or later,
people make compromises.

128
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,179
<i>They don't like what they do.</i>
<i>They hate their boss.</i>

129
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,741
They're bored most of the time.
It's what having a job is.

130
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,912
Mm-hmm.

131
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:45,185
Okay, well,
what if this whole thing

132
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,317
was a message from God?

133
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,056
What do you think God's
trying to tell us?

134
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,326
Maybe he's trying to tell us
that it's time for us

135
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,596
to move out
of New York City.

136
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:59,298
I could finally take your dad
up on his job offer.

137
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,863
I think Ohio will be the best place
to raise a baby.

138
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,274
We have your parents
to help us out.

139
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,541
You always said you didn't want
to work in an office.

140
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,947
But now all I care about
is taking care of you and him.

141
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,974
Okay?

142
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,611
Besides,
I think advertising

143
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,554
will be a pretty great job
to have, right?

144
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,682
Think up ideas all day long,
get paid for it?

145
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,996
We could have a house and a car.

146
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,656
- It would be a lot quieter.
- Yes.

147
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,371
We could have a yard.

148
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,897
That's what
I'm talking about, baby--

149
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,035
you, me, Ollie,

150
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,671
chillin' in our yard

151
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,511
- with our cows.
- I could bake pies every day.

152
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:47,713
You know how to bake a pie?
How come you never made me a pie?

153
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,348
Whoo-hoo, Ohio!
Look, Oliver!

154
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,515
<i>Yes!</i>

155
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,965
Lot of white people
in this neighborhood.

156
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,178
Kids, welcome!

157
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,018
Great!
It's your parents.

158
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,024
They're in
our house already.

159
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:02,494
- Look at that baby!
- I'm gonna eat you!

160
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:06,487
- I'm gonna eat you up!
- Baby!

161
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,557
Your stuff got here
safe and sound,

162
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,001
not that you
had very much.

163
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,437
Dad, our apartment in New York
was about the size of this porch.

164
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:14,700
I love it.
Go ahead.

165
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,140
Whose furniture is this?

166
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,673
- Surprise!
- <i>Got you a little housewarming gift.</i>

167
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,619
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah, you shouldn't have.

168
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,122
They threw in the bassinet
for half price.

169
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,455
Mom, what's with all
the Spanish?

170
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,122
This is your mother's
new crusade.

171
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:41,292
Oh, it's not a crusade,
Mr. Cynical.

172
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,166
Nancy Hodgekiss told me
about this family

173
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,795
that just moved here
from Argentina.

174
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,739
<i>So I thought there must be</i>
<i>something I could do to help.</i>

175
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,572
So I'm teaching
them English.

176
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,946
You know, having a job
completely changes a man, Tom.

177
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,882
It's not just
about the money.

178
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,045
It's about having
a purpose.

179
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,282
It's about feeling
proud of yourself.

180
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:06,052
- Dad.
- I've been employed before, Bob.

181
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,060
No, I'm not talking
about a cook.

182
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,221
I'm talking about
a <i>real</i> job.

183
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:13,095
- Dad, Tom was a chef.
- A chef's a cook, right?

184
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:16,295
Personally, I think being
a cook is a real job.

185
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,964
You want a tip on how to succeed,
you take a look at this girl here.

186
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:23,133
Did you know that your wife
was Phi Beta Kappa?

187
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,235
That she got 170
on the LSAT?

188
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,905
I know that, Bob.

189
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,245
If you remember,
we've been dating since college.

190
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:33,479
<i>Me Ilamo el pollo...</i>

191
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,011
<i>Don't eat me!</i>
<i>I'm for grownups!</i>

192
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,616
You know who I'm putting
in charge of training Tom?

193
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,491
- Chip Sanders.
- Oh, great.

194
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,995
Who's Chip Sanders?

195
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,792
<i>Sofia never told you about Chip?</i>

196
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,129
He's just this guy
I went to high school with.

197
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,795
Eat up, Tom. You got 20 more
chickens in there.

198
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,335
So what's this
Chip guy like?

199
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,068
I haven't seen him
for years.

200
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,440
We were
in cheerleading together.

201
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,344
Which reminds me,

202
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,042
When are you gonna dig out
one of your cheerleading outfits

203
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,641
and do a little
routine for me?

204
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,517
I don't know. Are you gonna
score a touchdown for me?

205
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:12,012
Oh, I will score
a touchdown.

206
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,457
I will.

207
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,961
Tom, don't.

208
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,097
It's just...

209
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,932
Oliver eats from there.
It just seems kind of weird.

210
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,597
I'm sorry. Maybe it's just
a little too early.

211
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,405
- Is that okay?
- Of course it's okay. Of course.

212
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,619
- It's totally fine.
- Okay.

213
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,252
Wish me luck, family members.

214
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,291
- Give 'em hell.
- I'll miss you guys.

215
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,862
Tom, hi.

216
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,528
- Welcome to Sunburst.
- Thank you.

217
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,367
I should've told you,
suit and tie is not required.

218
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,838
Casual Friday
every day?

219
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,672
No, it's not business casual.
We tried that.

220
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,008
It's business appropriate.

221
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,981
It's about being yourself,
but in an appropriate way.

222
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,075
It's kind of special.

223
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:49,645
You know, I've been here
longer than anybody, 30 years.

224
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,883
<i>Last year</i>
<i>a visionary took over.</i>

225
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,688
His name-- Don Wollebin.

226
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,696
<i>Guys! Guys,</i>
<i>I want you to meet Tom Reilly,</i>

227
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,630
Our new assistant
associate-creative.

228
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,758
- Hey, Tom.
- Hey, guys.

229
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,290
- This is Manny.
- This is Doug.

230
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:06,429
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

231
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,440
- What's that?
- What are you trying to do?

232
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,272
- You got something in your hand there?
- Hey, Tom, catch!

233
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,904
- Whoops!
- Yes!

234
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,470
Nice, Manny!

235
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,142
- Can't let my man down.
- You got to catch it, Tom.

236
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:21,152
The "yes" ball gets thrown around
the office all day long.

237
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:24,678
It's a way of showing
that we're all in sync.

238
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:27,317
- Oh.
- Don Wollebin taught us

239
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:30,453
that every company
is a multi-mind organism.

240
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,327
Do you know what
an organism is, Tom?

241
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,797
Sure.

242
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:36,892
An organism is a living thing.

243
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,836
Is it, Tom?

244
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,736
What about a person?

245
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,934
A person's a living thing.

246
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:46,809
Forgive me, Tom, but that's a pretty
old-fashioned way of looking at things.

247
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:50,008
See, here at Sunburst,
we treat people like people,

248
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:53,018
- not like things.
- Oh.

249
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,850
Don't worry about it. It took me
a while to get my mind around it as well.

250
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,719
Once you start thinking
about stuff in a new way,

251
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,951
it'll turn your whole
world upside down.

252
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,926
Come on.

253
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:08,260
People just aren't eating
as much fried fish anymore.

254
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,825
So Don says,
"Let's shift the paradigm.

255
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:12,837
Forget fried fish.

256
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,135
Let's re-invent
the tartar sauce

257
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,267
As a hamburger spread.

258
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,436
Call it 'Pickle Whip'

259
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,378
and sell it to teenagers!"

260
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:25,281
- That's classic Wollebin.
- <i>No question.</i>

261
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,114
<i>Now last but not least,</i>

262
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,120
I want to introduce
all of you

263
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,418
To our new assistant
associate-creative--

264
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,550
Tom Reilly.

265
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:39,393
Thank you all. I'm sure
that this experience will--

266
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,126
- Sit down, Tom. It's all right.
- Okay.

267
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,135
- Hey, Tom.
- Uh-oh.

268
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:48,071
Nice catch!

269
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:51,406
- Throw it!
- Nice!

270
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,644
Here we go!

271
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,583
<i>Yes, throw it around!</i>
<i>Throw it around!</i>

272
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,883
Oh, I don't want to do it, either.
Or do I?

273
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:05,856
Go long!

274
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,618
Come on, buddy.
You got to jump for those.

275
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,059
Unfortunately,
I can't.

276
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,501
And I haven't been
able to, Tom,

277
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,437
Since I was five.

278
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,740
It's great to meet you, though.
My name's Chip Sanders.

279
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:29,509
This is the guy you're
gonna be working under.

280
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,578
Hey, Chip, I'm really sorry
about what just happened.

281
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,089
I feel like an idiot.

282
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:41,854
Hold it right there, Tom.
We don't apologize at Sunburst.

283
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,125
The Japanese have a term
called <i>moushiwake</i>.

284
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,564
It's a way of saying
you're sorry

285
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,760
and taking responsibility.

286
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,532
At Sunburst, if you feel
you've fallen short,

287
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,438
you write a <i>moushiwake</i>

288
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,465
on one of these
little yellow pads.

289
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,841
Here. Here you go.

290
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,812
<i>Just go ahead,</i>
<i>write it down.</i>

291
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:05,544
"Chip, I'm sorry I threw
the imaginary ball"--

292
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,211
It's supposed
to be silent.

293
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,416
Tom, don't you
worry about it.

294
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,894
If I got depressed every time
somebody made a joke at my expense,

295
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,557
- I'd never get out of bed.
- I wasn't making a joke. I didn't--

296
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,863
Tom, you'll be working
under the best here.

297
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,199
- Oh, sticky.
- I'm sorry.

298
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:29,799
Chip just won Ohio
Advertiser of the Year.

299
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,208
- Congratulations.
- I don't do it for the awards.

300
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,576
He created
Señor Tomato

301
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,344
for the Ketchup Kaliente campaign.

302
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,544
<i>Ay, caliente!</i>

303
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,713
<i>Arriba.</i>

304
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,745
- I love this guy.
- Yeah, I'm pretty proud of him.

305
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,418
There's not a lot of Latino characters
in advertising.

306
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,860
He seems like
a really nice role model.

307
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,591
Well, it's nice to do well,

308
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,824
but also to do good.

309
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,563
<i>Ay, caliente!</i>

310
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,398
Look who's awake!

311
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,938
It's Mr. Stinky-winky!

312
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,773
It's Mr. Stinky-winky's pinkies.

313
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:12,409
You made mommy
a nice little poo, a stinky poo.

314
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,078
Yes, you did.

315
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,555
A binky drinky.
A pinky dinky.

316
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:21,423
"He backed away. His hand
holding the purple crayon shook."

317
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,791
You don't understand
a word I'm saying, do you?

318
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,594
"Johnson told the senate
subcommittee

319
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,363
he was satisfied
with the president's budget,

320
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:33,064
even though it represented
a 6% decrease

321
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,630
from last year."

322
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,911
So...

323
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,087
You married Sofia Kowalski.

324
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,817
- You are one lucky man.
- Thanks.

325
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,087
- Do you love her, Tom?
- Oh, yeah.

326
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,957
Do you earn her love
every single day?

327
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,655
I believe I do, Chip.

328
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,459
That's all I need to hear.

329
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,899
So, listen, I want you to know
that I don't care

330
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,100
Whether you got this job
through family connections

331
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,665
or had to earn it
like the rest of us.

332
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,075
What's important is that you're here,
and that's awesome.

333
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:16,137
Okay, well, I'm just
excited to jump in.

334
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,944
Whatever you got for me,
just let me know.

335
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,713
Hang on there, killer. We're gonna
walk before we run, okay?

336
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,448
- Did you see "Karate Kid"?
- Yeah.

337
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:26,457
Miyagi. Macchio.
Okay?

338
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:30,154
And right now we're in the
"Wax on, wax off" period.

339
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,028
Advertising here.

340
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,227
Advertising never here.

341
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,939
She and my mom got in a heated argument
and my mom took her to the ground

342
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,705
and started hitting her,

343
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,712
while my dad stood
over top, laughing.

344
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,873
<i>Did you later find out</i>
<i>that that wasn't true?</i>

345
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,213
- Hearsay.
- <i>Your honor, hearsay.</i>

346
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,152
<i>Did you ever hear your sister say</i>

347
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,849
- <i>that she hated your mother?</i>
- <i>Constantly.</i>

348
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,684
- Hi.
- Hi.

349
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,857
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

350
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,798
- Are those snaps?
- Yeah.

351
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,029
- That's pretty cool.
- <i>It's pretty stupid.</i>

352
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,128
My dad won't let me
watch TV anymore.

353
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,004
- That's bullshit, dude.
- Yeah.

354
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,565
This is all I can do.

355
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,475
Want to trade?

356
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:24,004
Just kidding.

357
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,017
Like, that one was a dud.

358
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,042
It happens.

359
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:31,544
So during the school year
I live with my mom in New Jersey.

360
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,785
And I spend the summer
here with my dad.

361
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,690
But he's at work
all the time,

362
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,854
<i>and all my friends</i>
<i>live back in Parsippany,</i>

363
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:41,024
so it's pretty gay.

364
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,173
Hey, think fast.

365
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,040
I'm just messing with you.

366
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,409
- I'm Carol, by the way.
- Tom.

367
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,346
- Hey, Tom, can I give you some advice?
- Yeah.

368
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,373
Get out of here. Run.
Run as fast as you can.

369
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,443
Walk out that door
and don't look back.

370
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:06,048
I'm just kidding.

371
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:09,288
But not really.

372
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,229
This is gonna be awesome.
Somebody's eating Chip's yogurt.

373
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,927
Watch your legs.
No brakes! Thank you.

374
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,663
How we doing, gang, huh?

375
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:27,741
Uh-oh. Either one
of you two guys seen--

376
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:38,416
- Is this your yogurt?
- Uh-huh.

377
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,687
Oh, because Bob had said
something about, like,

378
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,660
free snacks
in the kitchen.

379
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,491
Muffins.

380
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,520
<i>Muffins are for everyone.</i>
<i>Yogurt's mine.</i>

381
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,557
Everyone knows that.
Listen, my fault.

382
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,832
- You're new.
- I'll just go buy you another one.

383
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,169
No, no, I'm your mentor.
I should have told you.

384
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,402
I'll go hungry today.
That'll be my punishment.

385
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:59,910
No, no, please.
At least finish the rest of this.

386
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:03,176
No, you've already done about two-thirds
of that. Why don't you finish it off?

387
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,184
Okay, enjoy. It's peach.
My favorite.

388
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,612
I give you one week.

389
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:15,422
<i>Who is that? Who is that?</i>

390
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,893
Hi, Dad!

391
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,764
Dad, I pooped today.
What did you do?

392
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,428
Hey, please change
my diaper, Dad.

393
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:27,802
My dad loves Chip.
He's like the son he never had.

394
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,399
- What about me?
- It's completely different.

395
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,933
You're his son-in-law.

396
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:36,414
Chip's a great guy, babe.
He just--

397
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,609
I don't know. He seems a little
angry or something.

398
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,311
Well, maybe you'd be
a little angry too

399
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,013
if you'd lost
the use of your legs.

400
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,748
It's not that.
I don't know.

401
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,121
He just-- he's nice.

402
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,683
I just-- I think he might
have a dark side.

403
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:51,457
Tom, this is your
first week on the job.

404
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,521
I really hope you're
not picking a fight.

405
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,533
I'm not saying anything
bad about him.

406
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,195
Everybody has a dark side.
I have a dark side.

407
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,431
I'm very dangerous.

408
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,737
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

409
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,869
Come here.

410
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:13,582
What's up?

411
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,981
- Who is that person?
- That's Wesley.

412
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,081
His dad doesn't let
him watch TV.

413
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:24,455
I don't see the wisdom

414
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,987
of selling directly
to consumers.

415
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:30,263
Do you remember we spoke about
Smith & Hawken, sir? 2,000% sales growth?

416
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,963
We've got
a three-pronged strategy--

417
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:35,905
web advertising,
product partnerships and print ads.

418
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:39,001
Actually, it's a four-pronged strategy.
You forgot about direct mailing.

419
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,909
Direct mailing
is not part of this strategy.

420
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,538
- Actually, it is.
- No, it's not.

421
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:46,449
It is, Chip. If you took the time
to read the report like I did,

422
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,886
pages 23 through 29,
direct mailing.

423
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,253
I specifically said,
"No junk mail."

424
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:56,226
Now "no junk mail" means
"no direct mailing."

425
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,025
<i>Did my son say</i>
<i>you could do this?</i>

426
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:02,727
This meeting is over.
Goodbye.

427
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:08,033
I'm really sorry.

428
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,973
I guess I shouldn't
have said that.

429
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,409
That report was for internal
distribution only.

430
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:16,573
That's what "for internal
distribution only" means.

431
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:20,517
Mr. Nordhaus' son asked us
not to tell his father

432
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,144
about the direct mailing.

433
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,849
Because in five years,
when direct mailing takes effect,

434
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,984
- Mr. Nordhaus'll be dead.
- <i>I can still hear you.</i>

435
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,894
I guess we can kiss that account goodbye.

436
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,228
Bob, I'm really sorry.

437
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,790
I mean, <i>moushiwake</i>.

438
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,325
I'll write
a <i>moushiwake, Bob.</i>

439
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,361
Bob, if anybody should be
writing a <i>moushiwake, it's me.</i>

440
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:43,306
- Tom is my responsibility.
- <i>Chip, please.</i>

441
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,741
He's the one
who screwed up.

442
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,211
Wollebin gets back
from Nepal tomorrow.

443
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:52,080
I don't want to tell him you blew
a major account on your second day.

444
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,607
I'm gonna say it was me.

445
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,018
Oh, no, no, I can't let you
take the rap for that.

446
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,852
- Let me do it.
- Absolutely not, Chipper.

447
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,915
It's my family.

448
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,154
I'll clean up the mess.

449
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:05,788
Well, thank you, Bob.
I appreciate that.

450
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,060
Let's go back to work.

451
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,573
Hey, Tom, it's probably
none of my business,

452
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,578
but I doubt I'd ever
let my father-in-law

453
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,079
take a bullet
for me like that.

454
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:25,105
- Chip, it is none of your business.
- Sofia.

455
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,651
We are the Tigers!

456
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:31,212
And we're not cocky.

457
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,554
But we'll run you over...

458
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,651
Like a Kawasaki.

459
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,184
Vroom-vroom!

460
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,662
- Hey, baby.
- Sofia, hey! Let me see the baby.

461
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,996
- This is him.
- Oh my gosh,

462
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,830
look what you've made!

463
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:46,632
Who's the father?
Have you found him?

464
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,367
Sofia, ready, okay!

465
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,568
Remember this?

466
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,510
Let me tell you what we are:

467
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:56,981
W-i-n-n-e-r!

468
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,074
That's it!
Second half, second half.

469
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,347
Let me tell you
what you are:

470
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:04,321
L-o-s-e-r!

471
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,654
- That's great.
- <i>And...</i>

472
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,921
Riverside Tigers,
out of sight!

473
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,588
Riverside Tigers,
dyn-o-mite!

474
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,996
- I want to show you my--
- Hang on. Hang on.

475
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,762
- Explode.
- Explode!

476
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:20,032
Explode!

477
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,265
Explode?

478
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,274
Come on, you remember
how strong Chips Ahoy is.

479
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,334
- Come on, I got you. Ready? Ha!
- Okay.

480
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,312
Explode!

481
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:34,477
Oh, yeah.

482
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,213
I can't believe he remembered
all the moves.

483
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:41,089
Oh, yeah,
he's a real champ.

484
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,617
I bet he had a huge crush
on you in high school, didn't he?

485
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,596
Well...

486
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,793
we did sort of
have sex once.

487
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,631
What?

488
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,900
I thought you said he was
paralyzed from the waist down.

489
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:57,135
Well, not completely.

490
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,609
So you just, like,
forgot to tell me about it?

491
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,077
It was a long time ago.

492
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:03,808
I didn't want you thinking
about that when you met the guy.

493
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,408
It's gross. I think you showed
really bad judgment.

494
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:10,046
- Why?
- Because, no offense to Chip...

495
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,612
but he's a dick.

496
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,851
You're not really jealous,
are you?

497
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:18,756
Don't you know I'm saving
my special cheer for you?

498
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,497
- You have a special cheer?
- Yeah.

499
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,498
Can I see it?

500
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,597
Show me upstairs.

501
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:34,333
- Hi.
- Hello, Wesley.

502
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,310
Can I get you anything?

503
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,475
No, I'm all right.

504
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:42,179
Got my Twizzler.

505
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,718
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

506
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,921
So you spend any time at your
own house there, Wesley?

507
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,986
Wesley's mom
lives in New Jersey,

508
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,260
and his dad works late.

509
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,028
Oh...

510
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,535
well, I'm glad
we could help out.

511
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,470
Welcome to the family, Wesley.

512
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:04,168
Thanks, Tom.
Hey, guys,

513
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,700
You wanna see
something really cool?

514
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,144
Sure.

515
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,980
Wesley, you're gonna
hurt yourself.

516
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,547
That was awesome.

517
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,891
Wait a second.
This is it.

518
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,328
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- <i>The Pickle Whip campaign.</i>

519
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,332
<i>This is how I'm gonna</i>
<i>redeem myself.</i>

520
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:31,665
You gotta promise me
you're never gonna do that again.

521
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:34,035
Do that again.

522
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:37,041
- I don't feel so good.
- Oh, come on, buddy. I need this for work.

523
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,134
- I don't know.
- I'll give you 20 bucks.

524
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,543
- Tom!
- Done and done.

525
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,048
Ow!

526
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:57,524
You hit my face.

527
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,460
If you want to feel
your insignificance

528
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:04,264
in the vastness of the universe,
I mean really feel it,

529
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,894
try boarding
in the Himalayas.

530
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,938
You, inspire me.

531
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,838
Sorry about your face.

532
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,478
That's Don Wollebin.

533
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:19,076
The rollercoaster
comes down the hill.

534
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,846
Right?

535
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,479
<i>Smash cut to this guy.</i>

536
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:26,854
"I am going so fast!
Wow!"

537
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,689
<i>And a brief shot of his buddies.</i>
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

538
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,388
This can only
go one direction--

539
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,454
"Whoaaaa!"

540
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,661
Rolls right into
a pile of Pickle Whip.

541
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,328
Tagline:

542
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,927
"Get whipped!"

543
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,065
I think that's really neat.

544
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,841
Hmm.

545
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,084
- That feels like a commercial.
- Exactly.

546
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,586
Who here
likes commercials?

547
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,887
Really, you like commercials?

548
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,593
Nobody likes commercials.

549
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,565
You know, that's true too.

550
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,099
We need a new slogan
around here--

551
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,336
"No commercials."

552
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,775
Definitely food for thought.

553
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,743
Chipper, did you--

554
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,271
Yes, I will give it a go.

555
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,978
Uh, Don, I've been thinking
along the same lines.

556
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,352
I don't see these as commercials,
I see them more like 30-second movies.

557
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,790
Having said that...

558
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:38,023
Power Pickle.
He's Señor Tomato,

559
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,893
only less Mexican,
and more attitude.

560
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:43,332
Power Pickle
loves extreme skating.

561
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,233
He loves
extreme snowboarding.

562
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,330
Also enjoys
extreme skydiving.

563
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:52,241
Most of all,
he enjoys extreme lunching.

564
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,438
Ha!
"Extreme lunching."

565
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,276
I think you have
something there.

566
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:00,974
Power... Pickle.

567
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,816
"Power Pickle."

568
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,955
It's phallic.

569
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,888
- <i>Phallic.</i>
- Oops.

570
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,931
Anyone else?

571
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,595
- Well, I have something.
- Who's this?

572
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:21,662
This is Tom Reilly. He's our
new assistant associate-creative.

573
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,607
Tom, it's generally
the creatives

574
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,303
or the associate-
creatives

575
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:29,507
who make these proposals.

576
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:32,277
It is better to listen
to a wise beggar

577
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,717
than a rich fool.

578
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:36,515
I want to hear the beggar.

579
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,181
Okay, thank you.

580
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,486
I saw this kid do this

581
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,857
kind of funny trick
the other day.

582
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,521
And I don't know,

583
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,725
I think it would make a hilarious ad.
Tell me what you guys think.

584
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:59,637
No way!

585
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,235
That's funny.

586
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,407
Congratulations, Tom.
You did it.

587
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,822
Tom, I want you going down
to Lion's Pride tomorrow

588
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,587
to show this thing
to Jack Connor.

589
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:16,888
- Chip.
- Boss.

590
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,486
You're Tom's wingman
on this thing.

591
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,588
Wingman, his.

592
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,997
How about that?

593
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,525
Do you mountain bike?

594
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:29,336
Yeah, whenever I get
the chance.

595
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:32,036
There's some amazing trails
around here, especially at dawn.

596
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:35,375
It's awe-inspiring.
We should go sometime.

597
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,514
Yeah.

598
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,108
- All right.
- Yeah, it's great, yeah.

599
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,620
I got to get a bike.

600
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,684
Hey, I hope there's
no hard feelings,

601
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:51,854
'cause I thought your whole
extreme pickle thing was really cool,

602
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,387
- when he was skydiving and stuff--
- Tom.

603
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:58,300
Let me tell you something:
if you think I care about Power Pickle,

604
00:33:58,336 --> 00:33:59,769
you're sorely mistaken, okay?

605
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,068
I can think up ideas
like that in my sleep.

606
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:05,075
And someday, when I'm
kicking ass in Barcelona,

607
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,634
I'm gonna look back
on this whole campaign

608
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:10,078
as some sad, pathetic,

609
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:13,550
little joke.

610
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,142
He said that?

611
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,983
I have no idea what
he was talking about.

612
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:19,854
There's this ad agency
in Barcelona called Idea.

613
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,553
They're, like, cutting-edge
euro-geniuses.

614
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:25,926
Chip applied for a job there.
Nobody's supposed to know about it,

615
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:28,329
but I saw him
mailing off a bunch

616
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,459
of Señor Tomato figurines.

617
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:33,959
- That guy is out of his mind.
- Tell me about it.

618
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,973
He is great
in the sack, though.

619
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:39,067
- How do you know?
- Nancy slept with him last Christmas.

620
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,568
She said it was
the best sex she ever had.

621
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:45,912
Apparently, he can, like,
balance on his arms

622
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,850
and then the angle
makes it intense

623
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:50,718
- because you're sitting--
- I don't want to hear about it, okay?

624
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:56,154
- What the hell?
- What?

625
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:01,454
Someone stole the picture of my wife.

626
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:06,863
- Sofia Kowalski!
- Abby March, wow!

627
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,929
Hey, it is so good
to see you.

628
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:12,306
- And who is this little guy?
- This is Oliver.

629
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,334
Petey--

630
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,437
Petey,

631
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,745
Do you want
to give Oliver a hug?

632
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,512
Hmm? Yeah?

633
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,382
Oh, that's a big yes.

634
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,287
Oh, yes.

635
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,551
Loves.

636
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,151
Oh. Loves.

637
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:31,661
Loves for your new friend, oh.

638
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:37,728
"Apana" is the sanskrit word
for "waste."

639
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:41,329
The <i>apana asana</i>
aids in digestion

640
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,397
And helps with gas
and constipation.

641
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,966
<i>Shall we get permission?</i>

642
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,178
Do you want to do <i>apana</i>?

643
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,641
Good? Thank you.

644
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,676
<i>Sofia...</i>

645
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,884
I noticed that you didn't
ask Oliver's permission.

646
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:03,155
In our class,
we use the RIE method.

647
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,389
You must ask
your baby's permission

648
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:08,193
- before you do anything.
- Oh, okay.

649
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,929
Isn't that right, Petey?

650
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,440
Did you need some?

651
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,734
I don't know.
What is it?

652
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,609
It's bag balm.

653
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,548
Dairy farmers use it
as a moisturizer for cow udders.

654
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,518
It is the best thing
in the world for sore nipples.

655
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:31,113
I have a ton at home.
You are welcome to have this.

656
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,919
Thanks. Yeah, breastfeeding's
been hell for me.

657
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,448
As soon as Oliver
hits six months,

658
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:37,085
I'm switching
to formula, big time.

659
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:42,929
Sofia, please no formula.

660
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:47,631
If you don't want to do it,
I'll breastfeed Oliver myself.

661
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:54,842
Wollebin just gave this to me
to thank me for hiring you.

662
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,904
- Wow.
- You know,

663
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,439
it hasn't been exactly
smooth for me

664
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,178
since he took over.

665
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,313
Anyway, I just want
to tell you that

666
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,620
I think you're
doing a great job, son.

667
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:10,786
Well, thank you...

668
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,956
- Dad.
- Have you seen my whales?

669
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:15,727
What?

670
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:18,098
Have I showed you
my whales?

671
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,069
No.

672
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:23,471
Sometimes I just sit
in here and stare at them.

673
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:26,203
<i>It's so peaceful.</i>

674
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,338
I even give them names.

675
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,507
That one-- ow, fuck!

676
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:34,780
- Are you okay?
- That lamp is hotter than shit!

677
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,494
Shh, come on, buddy.

678
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,303
- After you.
- Hi.

679
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:05,247
Hello, wife.

680
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,774
Hello, child.

681
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:10,343
- Daddy's home.
- He's been like this all day.

682
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:14,290
Oh, no!
What's wrong, cranky bear?

683
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,488
Hey, little bear.

684
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:20,019
Hi.

685
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,498
Gotta be kidding me.

686
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,501
- What's with the bike?
- <i>Hot, right?</i>

687
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,129
<i>Wollebin asked me to go</i>
<i>mountain biking with him.</i>

688
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,264
He asked me right after
he put me in charge

689
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,673
of the Pickle Whip
campaign.

690
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:35,668
- $1,200?
- Babe, a bike like that should cost $1,500.

691
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,510
<i>Try and bend those rims.</i>

692
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:39,175
Try. Kick 'em.
You can't bend those rims.

693
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,548
They're called
high-performance rims.

694
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:43,849
Honey, you've never been
mountain biking in your life.

695
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,356
Look, if you want me to return the bike,
I'll return the bike.

696
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,518
- I want you to return the bike.
- No, I'm not going to return the bike,

697
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,256
Because I think
physical fitness is important,

698
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,355
and I think it's good
for my career.

699
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,662
My day was terrible.

700
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,862
This girl I hated
in high school came over

701
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,564
and made me go
to her baby group

702
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,196
and everyone called me
a bad mommy.

703
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,366
You're an amazing mommy.

704
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:07,468
Daddy gets to go mountain
biking with Wollebin.

705
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,240
Chip can't go
mountain biking.

706
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,239
- Tom.
- It was a joke.

707
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,684
I don't think making fun
of peoples' handicap is funny.

708
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,950
It was a joke.

709
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,392
Asleep in under
five minutes.

710
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,760
Daddy's got
the magic touch.

711
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,891
So what does Wesley get out
of this whole Pickle Whip thing?

712
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,902
I already got him
to sign a release.

713
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:35,030
He gets $1,000
if the ad airs.

714
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,733
What are you doing?

715
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:39,607
It's bag balm, Tom.
They use it for cow's udders.

716
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:43,443
"Rub on udders." Wow.

717
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,108
I don't know, sweetie.
It just feels like the whole thing's

718
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,014
a little exploitative
of Wesley.

719
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,916
Oh, I get it.

720
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:51,251
I think I see what's happening.

721
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:53,688
Somebody's a little jealous.

722
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,749
- What?
- Oh, come on.

723
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,158
You're used
to being the star,

724
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:58,991
And now I'm in
the limelight a little bit.

725
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:01,224
It's probably driving
you crazy. Admit it.

726
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,761
Admit it.

727
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:18,038
- Score a touchdown.
- Not gonna happen, Tom.

728
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:26,651
Use the bag balm.

729
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:30,483
Jack, good to see you again.
How are you?

730
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,826
Please meet Tom Reilly.
He's been helping me out on the campaign.

731
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,455
Reilly, is it?

732
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:36,591
Do you have Irish blood
in you by any chance?

733
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:39,262
Me father's father was an Irishman,

734
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:42,329
so I have a wee bit
of the leprechaun in me.

735
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:45,501
Are you making fun of me?

736
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:51,014
No, I'm sorry. I-- I--

737
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,051
I thought that was
a fake accent.

738
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,645
- Why?
- I don't know.

739
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,713
I don't know.

740
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,521
That was unfortunate.

741
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,085
Jack, you're gonna love
the new campaign. Let's jump right in.

742
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,875
I mean,
is that something?

743
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,570
Is that incredible
or what?

744
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:24,172
When I saw that kid,
I said, "that's it."

745
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,046
We've all just said hello
to the new face of Pickle Whip.

746
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:29,109
- Well done, Chip.
- Thanks so much, Jack.

747
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,850
So sorry, but you're gonna
all have to excuse me.

748
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:37,526
Jack.

749
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:40,189
- Oh, certainly, of course.
- Great.

750
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,324
<i>And, Tom, do us a favor, please,</i>

751
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:45,699
and present the market-
penetration strategy.

752
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,299
Market-penetration
strategy.

753
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,572
Something that's very important
to today's youth market...

754
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,910
Penetration.

755
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,607
Let's stick
with long-range,

756
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:04,610
Because that way we know
we're gonna maximize "p"--

757
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,486
Profit.

758
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,355
Isn't "p" price?

759
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,087
You're thinking
of uppercase.

760
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,857
This is a lowercase "p".

761
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:14,865
Write that down.
Here we go.

762
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:18,232
Next slide.

763
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,965
That's just "J" and "Q".

764
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:23,030
There they are.
Next slide.

765
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:26,509
Have you talked to Chris
about the penetration strategy?

766
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,411
- Chris?
- Chris Caldwell.

767
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,937
<i>Your director of market research.</i>

768
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:34,450
Oh, "Chris" Chris.

769
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,510
"Chris" Chris. Yes.

770
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,387
I talked to him this morning.
He loves it.

771
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:42,358
Chris Caldwell
is a woman.

772
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,953
Yes.

773
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,895
Why did you say "he"?

774
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:50,128
It's a little joke we have.

775
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,534
Everybody calls Chris
a "he" because...

776
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:57,096
she looks like a man.

777
00:42:57,141 --> 00:43:00,633
<i>She had</i>
<i>a little mustache.</i>

778
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,339
But it's gone.

779
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:04,847
She waxed it.

780
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,513
Tom, sorry I had
to duck out.

781
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,491
How'd the rest
of the meeting go?

782
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:18,393
How do you think it went?
You left me high and dry in there.

783
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,897
I'm sorry.
I had a medical emergency.

784
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,694
Yeah, right.
What kind of emergency?

785
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:25,759
Well, I don't really enjoy talking about it
in front of other people,

786
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:29,364
but if you must know, I sometimes
have a bladder control problem, okay?

787
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:32,500
<i>It's very embarrassing, but it is one</i>
<i>of the things that you have to deal with</i>

788
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:34,738
when you're paralyzed
from the waist down.

789
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,303
Really, Chip?!
Because my wife informs me

790
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:39,441
that you're not completely
paralyzed down there.

791
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:45,772
<i>Don't get your undies in a bunch.</i>

792
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:48,182
You're not
gonna get fired.

793
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:50,209
Look, first of all,
word on the street

794
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:52,245
is that Jack Connor
is like a total alcoholic.

795
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:54,689
- He's not gonna remember he met you.
- I can't lose this job.

796
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,421
- I promised my wife.
- You can't drive yourself crazy

797
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:01,295
trying to please your wife.
You gotta relax.

798
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:05,159
- Yeah, I do.
- Right.

799
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,602
And the thing is, I don't give
a shit about tartar sauce.

800
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:09,970
Who cares about
tartar sauce, you know?

801
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,975
I mean, I don't want
to be one of those people

802
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,477
obsessing about things
that don't matter.

803
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:17,275
Yes!
When you get fired...

804
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:19,373
you're gonna be able
to start from scratch.

805
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:22,442
- You said I wasn't gonna get fired.
- Whatever.

806
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:23,885
<i>A toast!</i>

807
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:26,116
You know, Tom,
to be honest,

808
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,683
for a long time,
Amelia and I have been wondering

809
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,093
how long it's gonna take you
to get your act together.

810
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,791
- Bob!
- Amelia, please!

811
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:38,467
It's taken you a while,

812
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:41,130
but you finally realized
who you are.

813
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:42,638
You're an ad man.

814
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,735
Tom Reilly.

815
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,539
Ad man.

816
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,643
You look up to me now, buddy.

817
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:57,551
When you get a little bit older,

818
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,455
You're gonna realize
that your dad

819
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:03,551
has absolutely no idea
what he's doing.

820
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:10,323
I don't want
to go back out there.

821
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:15,435
I don't want to go back out there,
so how about you and me,

822
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:18,930
we're just gonna sit in here
until you crap your pants again.

823
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,967
Okay?

824
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:23,536
Are you okay?

825
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,048
Yeah, why?

826
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,483
I know starting a job
can be really stressful,

827
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,316
but you know you can
talk to me about it.

828
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,459
Chip said you blew up
at him today.

829
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,524
- What?
- He was worried about you.

830
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:42,225
He said you were
acting kind of hostile.

831
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:43,790
<i>I'm acting hostile?</i>

832
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:45,752
Yeah!

833
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,076
Jack Connor tore me
a new asshole this morning.

834
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,088
What the hell
is the matter with you?

835
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:14,989
Bob, <i>moushiwake, okay?</i>
<i>But Chip hung me out to dry.</i>

836
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:18,256
Jack said that you made fun
of his mother for having a mustache!

837
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:20,456
That's not true.
I said Chris Caldwell had a mustache.

838
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,761
Chris Caldwell doesn't
have a mustache!

839
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:26,166
I thought Chris Caldwell was a man
because Chris is often a man's name.

840
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:30,306
Three creatives came
to me this morning

841
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,673
and said that you were
humiliating Chip about his disability.

842
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:36,474
- Chip is trying to sabotage me.
- Chip is trying to mentor you!

843
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,640
He came to me and said,
"How can I help him?"

844
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,843
Oh, don't you see?
That's part of his plan.

845
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:43,717
He's like a mind-game genius,
that guy.

846
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,951
You know, you may not
care that I put my job on the line

847
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:50,551
to get you hired, but you moved
your family 1,000 miles for this.

848
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,859
You've got to pull
yourself together.

849
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:56,866
We're just
washing our hands.

850
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,562
I just put him down for a nap.
I'm desperate for a little grownup talk.

851
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,970
- Did DePalma come back to you?
- Yeah, we got a court date.

852
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:04,496
No, no, no, the other file.

853
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,941
<i>Honey, I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>It's crazy here.</i>

854
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:09,138
- <i>Can I call you later?</i>
- <i>Sure.</i>

855
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:22,087
Tom, wait up.
Sorry about that back there.

856
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,854
- Rough times, huh?
- Yeah.

857
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:26,624
Hey, looks like someone could use
a good listener, buddy, huh?

858
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:29,427
I just don't think I fit
into this place, Manny.

859
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,991
- I've been there, man.
- You?

860
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:34,162
You are Sunburst.
What are you talking about?

861
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:36,035
You think so, huh?

862
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:45,236
The second I bought this little guy,
it made me feel a whole lot more hip.

863
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:46,943
- Want to try it on?
- No, no,

864
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,077
why don't you keep it?
Because that's yours.

865
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,417
It's not really a hipness thing.
I just...

866
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:53,252
I'm not getting along
with Chip at all

867
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:56,589
and that's really starting to mess up
my relationship with my wife.

868
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:59,254
Well, I think today's
your lucky day.

869
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:02,026
- I'm studying to be a marriage counselor.
- Really?

870
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,144
Sofia, remember that the laughter

871
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,873
starts deep within

872
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:20,440
and then just comes
ro-ho-ho-ho-olling out.

873
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:22,247
Ha-ha-ha!

874
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,185
Yeah, I really only laugh

875
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:27,486
when something
funny happens.

876
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:31,085
I've noticed that Oliver
isn't very happy.

877
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:34,393
- <i>He never smiles.</i>
- He smiles all the time.

878
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:37,400
He just isn't smiling right now.

879
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:40,198
Now you're not gonna
like this, Sofia,

880
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:43,001
but you are
a very unhappy person,

881
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,668
and I don't think
it's good for Oliver.

882
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,576
You're not going to like this either,
Abby, but you're an idiot.

883
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:51,706
And your son Petey is a dipshit.

884
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:54,774
It's okay.

885
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:57,787
I know, sweetie. Here.

886
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:15,430
Let's start by taking

887
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:17,440
a nice deep breath.

888
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:20,500
<i>Just relax, okay?</i>

889
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:24,341
Mom!

890
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:27,111
Mom, answer the phone!

891
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:30,608
So sorry. Mom!

892
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:33,589
Answer the phone and don't
come down here. I'm having a session.

893
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:39,423
Many of the exercises I'm studying
are a little new age-y,

894
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:42,626
so I hope you guys'll
just trust me and roll with it.

895
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,258
- Sure.
- Sure, Manny.

896
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,667
Great.
Let's start by...

897
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:48,466
holding each
other's genitals.

898
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:49,995
- Okay, I'm leaving.
- What?!

899
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,372
- No, not holding, poking.
- You're not poking anything.

900
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:54,240
Baby, he's kidding.
Tell me you're kidding.

901
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,269
I'm kidding. Just want to lighten
the mood, that's all.

902
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:59,282
- Lightening the mood. Come on.
- That's all it is.

903
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:02,547
Okay, you know what?
Don't sit down. I've got an exercise.

904
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:05,714
This is called
"I'm upset that..."

905
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:08,519
It's a great way to get to the root
of hurt feelings.

906
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:12,153
You'll each complete the sentence,
"I'm upset that..."

907
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:15,892
and then tap each other
with the bat, okay?

908
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:17,524
Sofia, you go first.

909
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:23,837
I'm upset that you bought
that mountain bike.

910
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:26,342
Now tap him.
Boom.

911
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:27,673
Good. Tom.

912
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:30,680
I'm upset that...

913
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:34,150
we haven't had sex
in a long time.

914
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:39,284
I'm upset that you didn't get the chance
to have an 8-Ib. baby

915
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:42,120
shoot out of your vagina.
Maybe then you'd understand.

916
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,956
Good.
That's great.

917
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,962
I'm upset that
you banged Chip!

918
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,226
- You banged Chip?
- No.

919
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:51,166
- Yes.
- I'm upset that you told him I banged Chip.

920
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:52,668
Ow!

921
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,170
You're not supposed
to hit people in the face.

922
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:59,465
I'm upset that you talked me
into coming here!

923
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:02,069
Don't hit me anymore please.

924
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:05,104
Please don't hit me anymore.

925
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:21,356
No, that was helpful.

926
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:23,423
Look what I grabbed
on the way out.

927
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:27,334
I love you so much.

928
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:30,703
- I love you too.
- But are you happy?

929
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:34,401
You can tell me.

930
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:37,345
I--

931
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,348
Wait, that might
be the babysitter.

932
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,747
Hello.

933
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:43,378
So I'm looking through
the 1989 "Tiger's Paw"

934
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:47,186
<i>and I see a picture of a very</i>
<i>pretty girl in a Yaz t-shirt.</i>

935
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:50,352
Yeah, you know what? I can't really talk
right now. Can I call you back later?

936
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,883
"Chipwich,

937
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:54,761
thanks for making the last
four years so awesome.

938
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:58,564
<i>2 cool 2B 4-gotten."</i>

939
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:01,799
<i>Boy, those words have gotten me</i>
<i>through some pretty tough times.</i>

940
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,053
I got you.

941
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:29,958
Got you now, you freak.

942
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:45,314
Oh my God.

943
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:49,307
Tom-- Tom is a man with vision,
and I want him in that meeting.

944
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:53,081
Take this down to video tech
first thing in the morning.

945
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,057
- Yes.
- I want them to put the tag on it

946
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:56,820
- <i>and then make dubs.</i>
- <i>Dubs.</i>

947
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:00,023
Okay, all right.

948
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,238
Careful.

949
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,303
Hey, hey, buddy!

950
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,813
Just the man
I wanted to see!

951
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:53,577
We're going to do that cool
hamburger trick again, buddy.

952
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:56,517
- I can't.
- What are you talking about? Sure you can.

953
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:58,578
- I don't eat meat anymore.
- What?

954
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:01,021
I saw this show yesterday
about how they made meat.

955
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,752
It's all about killing animals.

956
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:06,193
- You became a vegetarian yesterday?
- Yeah. So what?

957
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:08,493
All right, cool, whatever.
We'll get you a veggie burger.

958
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:12,399
- Nah.
- Wesley, you'll get to be famous.

959
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:15,734
Like Harry Potter
or Urkel.

960
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:18,832
Tom, it's not gonna happen.
End of discussion.

961
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:22,333
- Don't be an idiot, Wesley. Give it to me.
- It's mine!

962
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,904
Now you'll get it back
when you eat a hamburger.

963
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:27,917
- Hey, come here!
- Help!

964
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:30,886
Wesley.
Wesley!

965
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:36,755
Wesley, I'm not
done talking to you!

966
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:39,626
Can I help you?

967
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:41,721
<i>Hey...</i>

968
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:44,996
I just moved in next door.

969
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,799
Nice to meet you.
Just talking to Wesley. He's great.

970
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:59,972
- <i>Tom.</i>
- Yeah.

971
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,441
Were you just yelling
at Wesley?

972
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:04,783
I need you to talk to that kid.

973
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,812
His priorities are out of line.

974
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:09,381
- What are you talking about?
- I accidentally taped over

975
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,758
the video of Wesley. We got
to get him to eat another burger.

976
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:14,491
Honey, if he doesn't want to
do it, find somebody else.

977
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:17,432
Sure, honey. I'll just get
one of the other kids on the block

978
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:19,162
who can swallow
a hamburger in one bite.

979
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,727
I'm sure there's not
a gag reflex on the block.

980
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:24,569
Okay, you gotta calm down.
You're acting crazy.

981
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:27,906
I'm acting crazy? That little twerp--

982
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:31,141
Could you get that?

983
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:36,148
Hi.
I believe your husband

984
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:38,347
has my son's
skateboard.

985
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:44,758
And now they're gonna
make me out to be the bad guy.

986
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:48,921
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

987
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,747
<i>Let's open up</i>
<i>some windows over there.</i>

988
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,551
Tom, you are not
going to believe this.

989
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:12,146
Bob left the Wesley tape
on his desk and we lost it.

990
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:14,247
Ah-ah! No shoes
on the prayer mat.

991
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:15,917
We found the culprit.

992
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:18,655
Somebody left the bulb
touching a stack of paper.

993
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:20,458
<i>Damn it!</i>

994
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,556
Jesus Christ, Bob.

995
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:25,067
- It was just an accident.
- No, no, no, no.

996
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:26,898
<i>It's been a series</i>
<i>of mistakes, Tom.</i>

997
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:29,268
Earlier this week,
he cost us a major account.

998
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:31,034
Could have been
the next Smith & Hawken.

999
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,440
Don, I can fix this.

1000
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:37,173
I can fix it. All I got to do
is get Wesley on tape again.

1001
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:39,841
Trust me. I can fix it.

1002
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:47,215
Go for help now. Go!

1003
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,953
<i>I'm not gonna</i>
<i>hurt you, Wesley.</i>

1004
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:52,427
I just want
to talk to you.

1005
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:54,089
Look what I got.

1006
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:58,032
$1,000 from my very
own bank account, huh?

1007
00:58:58,067 --> 00:58:59,762
For you!
What do you say?

1008
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:02,600
My lawyer said I can't
talk to you, dude.

1009
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,732
- Your lawyer?
- Hey, get away from the kids!

1010
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:06,799
- Get away from the kids!
- I'm just talking to him!

1011
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:08,606
Get away from the kids!

1012
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:12,038
- Come on, pick 'em up!
- What, are you crazy?!

1013
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:20,519
I know.
I can't believe it either.

1014
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,548
I will.

1015
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:25,493
Wait, Mom. Tom just got home.
Let me call you right back.

1016
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:27,860
My dad got fired.

1017
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,832
What?

1018
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:33,358
I told him to wait.
I was going to fix everything.

1019
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,769
He got blamed
for some kind of fire.

1020
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:38,501
Oh my God.
It's not about that.

1021
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:40,600
You see, the Wesley video
got destroyed in the fire, so--

1022
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:43,043
The Wesley video?

1023
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,979
What?

1024
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:48,074
You told me you taped over
the Wesley video.

1025
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,680
I know, and what I'm trying
to explain to you

1026
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,689
is that
it wasn't one thing.

1027
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:56,851
But Wollebin knows that the tape thing
wasn't my dad's fault, right?

1028
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:59,259
Sofia, it's a very
complicated situation.

1029
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:01,092
Did you tell him or not?
Yes or no?

1030
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:04,566
- It wouldn't have made a difference!
- I don't believe you.

1031
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,296
You know what, Sofia?

1032
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:09,169
If you'd helped me get Wesley to redo
the video instead of taking his side,

1033
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,503
- none of this would have happened.
- Are you insane?

1034
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,099
Your dad was gonna
get fired anyway!

1035
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:16,407
Do you want me to volunteer
to get fired too? I tried to fix it.

1036
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,073
It didn't work.
I'm sorry.

1037
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:21,345
I'm doing all of this
for you, Sofia.

1038
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:23,011
Everything.
You have it so easy.

1039
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:24,349
You get to hang out
with Oliver all day

1040
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:25,877
You think I like
what I'm doing?

1041
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:28,152
You think I like
that stupid job? I hate it!

1042
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:30,182
I am completely miserable!

1043
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:37,165
- Sofia.
- I'm going to my parents'.

1044
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,498
Call me when
you calm down.

1045
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:17,395
Sweet ride, Tom. And I thought
this thing was a poon magnet.

1046
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,737
What the hell are
you doing here, Chip?

1047
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:20,140
I was just
in the neighborhood.

1048
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,235
Did I see Sofia leaving
with a suitcase?

1049
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:24,508
- Don't worry about it.
- Is it work, Tom?

1050
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:27,243
'Cause I have heard that you've blown
your way through quite a few jobs,

1051
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:30,309
and the one thing about women
is that they can smell failure a mile away.

1052
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:33,049
- It's not work, okay?
- Is it sexual?

1053
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:35,614
Is there a midget
living in the basement?

1054
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:37,922
If there is, they are selling
the pump on the internet,

1055
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,053
- but I do not know if it works.
- I don't need a pump.

1056
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:44,294
The thought of Sofia
alone and vulnerable-- I don't like it.

1057
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:47,234
I swear to God, Chip, if you go
anywhere near my wife, I will--

1058
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:50,171
What are you gonna do, Tom? You gonna
catch us on your hidden camera?

1059
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,106
How do you know
about that?

1060
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:55,133
Let's drag.

1061
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:57,510
How do you know
about that?!

1062
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,309
Chip.

1063
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:04,546
I could not make it
up the steps.

1064
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:06,487
Hope, I'm not imposing.

1065
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,121
Son of a bitch.

1066
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:16,062
<i>Chip.</i>

1067
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:18,124
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

1068
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,133
you know, Bob,

1069
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:23,331
<i>I have to tell you...</i>

1070
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:27,041
That when I first heard the news,
I couldn't help it.

1071
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,805
I cried.

1072
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:32,142
Bless you, Chip.

1073
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,613
I've been going
to that place for so long,

1074
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:40,645
I'll probably go back
tomorrow out of instinct.

1075
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:44,023
Chip, you should stay
for dinner.

1076
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,961
- Wouldn't want to intrude.
- <i>You wouldn't be intruding.</i>

1077
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:51,599
Sofia. Didn't know
you were here.

1078
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:53,932
Yeah.

1079
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:34,272
Absolutely incredible, Chipper.

1080
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,972
Well, it's not easy swimming
with just your arms,

1081
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:39,345
Especially when
the water's just 38°.

1082
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:41,179
I can't believe
you're still alive.

1083
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:42,946
Always been
a risk taker, Sofia.

1084
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,919
I do like
to test the limits.

1085
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:47,445
<i>Chip, you fill</i>
<i>this house with warmth,</i>

1086
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,185
<i>and believe me,</i>
<i>we need that right now.</i>

1087
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:51,056
It isn't just that
Bob got fired,

1088
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:52,924
but Tom and Sofia
are having a really--

1089
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:56,762
- Mom. Mom!
- Well, you have.

1090
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,893
- Food was delicious.
- <i>It was.</i>

1091
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:01,927
Wasn't it?

1092
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:15,279
- Anyway.
- Anyway, I rented a movie.

1093
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:17,286
I've got it
in my saddlebag.

1094
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,947
I was gonna go home,
watch it alone.

1095
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:21,456
Love to share it,
if you guys are up to it.

1096
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,924
- <i>You want to see a movie?</i>
- Sure, Chip.

1097
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:27,756
Make yourself comfortable.

1098
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:30,095
<i>I have some things to do</i>
<i>in the bathroom.</i>

1099
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:32,157
Okay.

1100
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:42,735
<i>I want you.</i>

1101
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:46,509
- <i>What do I do?</i>
- <i>Everything.</i>

1102
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:55,390
That's me.

1103
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:02,053
Sofia, I need to talk to you.

1104
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:04,999
Listen, you have every right
to be upset with me.

1105
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:07,969
- Sweetie, I'm not angry.
- Let me finish. Let me finish, okay?

1106
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:09,631
I finally figured it out.

1107
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:11,731
I didn't put the wrong tape
in the camera.

1108
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:13,605
- Chip switched it.
- What?

1109
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:16,373
I was right all along, baby. He's been
trying to sabotage me since day one

1110
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,380
and now I have proof.
You can see his face

1111
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,678
- in the reflection of my computer monitor.
- Hi, Tom.

1112
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:23,617
What's he doing here?
What are you doing with my son?

1113
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:26,019
- Get the baby away from him!
- Tom, cool it!

1114
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:27,784
Why don't you take the baby?

1115
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:29,654
Did you come over here
to get with my wife, Hot Wheels?

1116
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,455
- Tom!
- Hot Wheels?

1117
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:33,462
Chip came over
'cause he heard Dad got fired.

1118
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:36,556
And how did that happen?
The same way my chair got shorter?

1119
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:40,035
The same way gay porn
got put on my computer?

1120
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,037
You had everybody fooled,
didn't you,

1121
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:43,629
- you "cripple"?
- Tom!

1122
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:45,937
- That's enough.
- "Poor me! I'm in a wheelchair!

1123
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:49,274
Everybody feel sorry for me and have
sex with me 'cause I can't use my legs."

1124
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:50,779
Or can he?

1125
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:53,213
He can walk.
I have proof.

1126
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:54,807
What's that?

1127
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:56,340
Get up, you faker.

1128
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:59,513
You can walk.
Let's show them how you walk.

1129
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:01,785
Tom, stop it!
What are you doing?

1130
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:03,985
- <i>Tom, what are you doing?</i>
- He plays tennis.

1131
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:05,584
Tom, you're gonna hurt him!

1132
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,323
- Dad, do something!
- Come on!

1133
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:09,228
Tom, have you lost your mind?

1134
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:11,961
- Tom, what are you doing?
- Tom, the man can't walk!

1135
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:14,401
- Oh, yeah? Let's find out!
- Oh, no!

1136
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:21,371
- He's dead!
- I'm okay.

1137
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:25,138
This isn't Chip.
It's Danny.

1138
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:28,378
- Danny?
- He's Chip's twin brother!

1139
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:31,784
He died in an accident
about five years ago.

1140
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,721
He was my hero.

1141
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:35,314
Tom, get down here!
Out of the house!

1142
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:38,259
- Out of the house! Out!
- Tom!

1143
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:40,228
I found--
I found it!

1144
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:41,923
- I saw his--
- Tom, out!

1145
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:44,023
I saw his reflection
in my computer monitor.

1146
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:45,931
- Out!
- Out!

1147
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:49,529
God's sakes, Tom, what the hell is
the matter with you?

1148
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:52,439
You just threw a disabled man
down a flight of stairs.

1149
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:54,272
<i>Moushiwake, Bob.</i>

1150
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,278
Obviously I was wrong
about the cripple thing.

1151
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:58,439
But he's the one responsible
for you getting fired.

1152
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:02,277
What the hell is wrong with you?

1153
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,583
You could have just killed him.

1154
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:07,680
Sofia.

1155
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:10,055
I think you should go.

1156
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:24,072
Ow!

1157
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:28,239
Stupid--

1158
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:43,122
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

1159
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:48,694
What I'm really
worried about is you.

1160
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:54,335
I can tell that
you're not happy,

1161
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:56,770
and I think
that it might be

1162
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:59,741
because you're
on the wrong track.

1163
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:02,801
I don't--
I don't know.

1164
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:06,645
Maybe it's because
you're still looking

1165
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:09,583
for something that
you haven't found yet.

1166
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:11,586
You know, I mean...

1167
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:15,382
I know that I am.

1168
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:18,587
You know, I mean, everybody thinks
that I've got everything, you know?

1169
01:08:18,627 --> 01:08:21,391
The Ohio
Advertiser of the Year

1170
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:24,399
and probably be hired
to go to Barcelona soon,

1171
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:28,267
But I don't have anybody
I can share that with, you know?

1172
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:30,465
And the one person

1173
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:32,667
that really does it for me

1174
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:36,371
is a girl that I met
back in high school.

1175
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:39,313
We are the Tigers

1176
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:41,475
and we're not cocky.

1177
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:45,009
We'll run you... Kawasaki.
You know what I mean?

1178
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:48,353
I've still got your panties
from that time that--

1179
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,984
Okay, Chip.
It's time to go.

1180
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:53,392
Okay, it's tough to hear.
I get it.

1181
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,405
Stay the hell away
from my wife, Chip.

1182
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:11,512
I got a news flash
for you, sparky:

1183
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:14,209
Your wife's gone.
She's way out of your league,

1184
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,411
and she's finally realized it, okay?
It's over.

1185
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:18,750
Easy! Huh?

1186
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:21,517
You think I can't defend myself
just 'cause I'm in a wheelchair?

1187
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:24,424
No, I know hapkido!

1188
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:29,252
That's for stealing
my yogurt, douche.

1189
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:32,866
See you at school tomorrow!

1190
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,900
Don't cry, Mom.

1191
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:40,272
I don't even know how
to take care of my own family.

1192
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:42,937
What are you talking about?
Of course you do.

1193
01:09:42,978 --> 01:09:44,969
No, I don't.

1194
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,710
You always knew
what to do.

1195
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:49,513
<i>You made it look so easy.</i>

1196
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:51,349
<i>I thought I could just copy you.</i>

1197
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,252
But I just--
I can't figure it out.

1198
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:54,688
I don't know
what I'm doing.

1199
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:58,682
No-- honey, nobody knows
what they're doing.

1200
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:00,820
There's nothing
to figure out.

1201
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:03,588
Right.

1202
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:09,601
It's okay, honey.

1203
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:12,072
Mommy's here.

1204
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:15,901
<i>Mamá está aquí.</i>

1205
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:23,246
Hello.

1206
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:25,515
- <i>Is this señor Chip Sanders?</i>
- What?

1207
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:28,955
<i>My name is Juan Castaneda</i>
<i>de los Cojones del Mono.</i>

1208
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:31,425
<i>I am the executive</i>
<i>vice president of Idea,</i>

1209
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,758

1210
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,559
<i>You sent to us your résumé.</i>

1211
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:38,999
Yes! Hello.
<i>Hola. Como esta?</i>

1212
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:41,093
<i>Very good. Thank you very much.</i>
<i>Will you indulge me,</i>

1213
01:10:41,136 --> 01:10:43,104
<i>please, sir, for one moment</i>
<i>and allow me to say</i>

1214
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:45,265
<i>to you that your work</i>
<i>is absolutely genius?</i>

1215
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:48,572
<i>Señor tomato is,</i>
<i>in a word, spectacular.</i>

1216
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:51,478
Yes, yes. Thank you.
<i>Gracias.</i>

1217
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:54,243
<i>You are very welcome.</i>
<i>I come to the point.</i>

1218
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:56,581
<i>You, sir, are being chosen</i>
<i>for the position</i>

1219
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:58,246
<i>of Director Creativo.</i>

1220
01:10:58,287 --> 01:11:01,586
<i>Can you fly to Barcelona</i>
<i>immediamente, please?</i>

1221
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:04,184
Sure!
<i>Sí, gracias.</i>

1222
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:07,161
Super.
<i>Definitivamente.</i>

1223
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:12,524
<i>Tom, Wollebin here.</i>

1224
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:14,536
<i>We set up a meeting</i>
<i>with that Wesley kid,</i>

1225
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:18,028
<i>but you probably know all about it,</i>
<i>seeing as your wife is his lawyer.</i>

1226
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:20,541
<i>Screw it.</i>
<i>I'm gonna send Chip.</i>

1227
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:22,771
Shit!

1228
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:34,112
Bob.

1229
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,693
- Have you seen Sofia?
- No, I went to Best Buy.

1230
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:43,164
When I got back, she was gone.
You all right?

1231
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:45,826
Bob, there's something
I have to tell you.

1232
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:49,201
The Wesley tape wasn't
destroyed in the fire.

1233
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:51,502
I accidentally taped over it.

1234
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,633
Sofia told me last night.

1235
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:55,576
I told her the same thing
I'll say to you:

1236
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:57,841
The only person responsible

1237
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,008
for me losing my job is me.

1238
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,678
I also started the fire.

1239
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:05,653
It was an accident.

1240
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,324
I wasn't aware.

1241
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:11,849
Are you okay?

1242
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:15,022
I bent over backwards
to sell Wollebin's vision,

1243
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:17,191
and I, you know...

1244
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:20,429
I knew in the back
of my mind it was bullshit.

1245
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:22,232
- It is bullshit, Bob.
- It is.

1246
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,761
- Screw him.
- Screw him!

1247
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:25,273
Screw him!

1248
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:30,202
You're all right, kid.

1249
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:32,179
You're all right.

1250
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:34,580
Sofia's getting
ice cream with Chip

1251
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:37,744
- at Eddie's Sweets.
- Thank you, Bob.

1252
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,361
- Oh, Jesus, Tom! You gotta take a shower.
- I'm sorry.

1253
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:53,626
<i>Go get her, son!</i>

1254
01:12:56,705 --> 01:13:00,505
<i>Hey, five bucks to whoever</i>
<i>can knock that tool off his bike!</i>

1255
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:23,021
These rims aren't
supposed to bend.

1256
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:35,571
Okay, Wesley.

1257
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:37,545
You just sign there
at the bottom of the paper.

1258
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:40,742
You're about to be a very
rich young man, okay?

1259
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:44,014
Try not to get the fudge
on the contract.

1260
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:46,646
- Don't do it, Wesley.
- Oh, good. Tom's here.

1261
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:48,986
Tom, what happened to you?

1262
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:50,889
Will everyone just please
listen to me for one second?

1263
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:53,326
Okay, Sofia, Wesley,

1264
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:55,728
Wesley's dad.

1265
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:58,700
<i>Sofia...</i>

1266
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:01,294
I know on paper
I'm not the most ideal husband.

1267
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:03,361
I'm selfish,
I can't hold down a job,

1268
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:06,841
And I think I may have turned
your father into a problem drinker.

1269
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:08,706
<i>Still, one thing you</i>
<i>said you loved about me</i>

1270
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:11,076
is that I could smell
bullshit a mile away.

1271
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:14,105
Well, this guy, Sofia,
is stuffed full of bullshit.

1272
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:17,778
And what he wants more than anything
in the world is to break us up.

1273
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:20,050
<i>You have to believe me.</i>

1274
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:22,283
What I realize now is
that you and Oliver

1275
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:25,521
are the only things
in this entire world that matter to me.

1276
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:28,189
Am I the only one hearing violins?

1277
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:32,132
- Baby, I can't lose you.
- <i>Tom--</i>

1278
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:34,135
Hello.

1279
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:37,002
<i>Hola, señor.</i>
<i>Uno momento, por favor.</i>

1280
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:40,133
This is my dream job
in Spain, okay?

1281
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:42,336
<i>They're calling to make</i>
<i>the final travel arrangements.</i>

1282
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:43,901
<i>It's the actual reason</i>
<i>that I came.</i>

1283
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:46,414
I don't really care
much about Wesley.

1284
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:47,881
Hey, uncool.

1285
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:49,907
Less words.

1286
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:53,217
I have one question.
Sofia-- Sese--

1287
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:56,816
<i>do I have them buy me</i>
<i>one plane ticket to Spain...</i>

1288
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:59,919
or <i>dos?</i>

1289
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:02,988
You know what, Chip?
I think you're weird and creepy,

1290
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:05,829
<i>And if you think I'd ever choose you</i>
<i>over the love of my life,</i>

1291
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:07,927
you're the most delusional man
on the face of the earth.

1292
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:09,835
That'd be <i>uno</i>.
<i>Gracias</i>.

1293
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:11,669
Thank you.

1294
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:15,108
Sweetie, you couldn't
lose me if you tried.

1295
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:17,577
And you've been trying
pretty hard lately.

1296
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:22,147
Great. <i>Momento.</i>

1297
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,345
I guess this is <i>adiós</i>.

1298
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:27,947
Sofia, you should know the night
that we made love, I faked my orgasm.

1299
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:31,624
Tom, you are never
gonna beat me,

1300
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:34,788
and I'm gonna send you a great
little thong shot from Barcelona.

1301
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:37,025
<i>Señor, if it's all</i>
<i>the same with you,</i>

1302
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:38,794
I'd like to travel today.

1303
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:42,167
Of course, señor Chip.
Yes, absolutely.

1304
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:45,298
I will have Barcelona's longest
limousine awaiting your arrival.

1305
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,638
<i>Fantástico.</i>

1306
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:50,167
- Everything worked out.
- Sure did.

1307
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:55,810
<i>Moushiwake,</i> Chip.

1308
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:01,686
- For what?
- I just wanted to say it one last time.

1309
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:08,226
Little help?

1310
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:21,634
<i>I know you consider yourself</i>
<i>more of a mango man, buddy,</i>

1311
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:24,339
but I switched it up today.
Could you tell?

1312
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:26,438
What flavor is that?
What flavor is that?

1313
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:28,676
It's chutney.

1314
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:31,151
I'm just kidding.
It's banana.

1315
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:32,915
Also, you know what
you'd probably like?

1316
01:16:32,955 --> 01:16:34,582
I mixed in a little
of this new formula

1317
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:36,614
<i>which I found in Hoboken.</i>

1318
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:38,421
<i>They say it's good stuff.</i>

1319
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,951
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, fatso.

1320
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,498
What are the men folk
up to today?

1321
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:46,797
The men--
we men...

1322
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:48,928
are gonna go
to Coney Island with Paco.

1323
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:50,962
'Cause I think
it's important

1324
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:53,702
that he be exposed
to carnies at a young age.

1325
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:55,175
- Hey, babe?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

1326
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,678
I got breakfast in the oven.
Be ready in 15 minutes.

1327
01:16:57,713 --> 01:17:00,045
- I really can't be late.
- Chocolate croissant.

1328
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,718
What's 15 minutes?

1329
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:06,550
I know how we can spend
six of those minutes.

1330
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:10,183
Six minutes-- you really think
you can last that long?

1331
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:12,125
<i>If I think about</i>
<i>Rosie O'Donnell,</i>

1332
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,651
I could last seven
and a half.

1333
01:17:14,696 --> 01:17:16,823
What do you think
of that?

1334
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,617
So make sure that you understand,
when you're chopping things up

1335
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:16,123
in the way that those people
to the north of Italy...

1336
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:19,457
<i>...that they don't mind chopping...</i>

1337
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:22,258
That's the kid.
Let's go.

1338
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:31,602
People are out of their minds.

1339
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:35,274
Hey, Tom! You gotta
come see this guy.

1340
01:18:37,579 --> 01:18:40,309
- What?
- <i>You missed it.</i>

1341
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:42,578
Let's go, man.
