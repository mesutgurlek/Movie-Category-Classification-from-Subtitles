1
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,597
Uther!

2
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:36,190
Merlin!

3
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:40,901
Merlin, I am the strongest.

4
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:42,265
I am the one.

5
00:02:56,687 --> 00:02:59,212
The sword! You promised me the sword!

6
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:03,558
And you shall have it,
but to heal, not to hack.

7
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:05,820
Tomorrow...

8
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:08,160
...a truce. We meet at the river.

9
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:11,166
Talk! Talk is for lovers, Merlin.

10
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:14,002
I need a sword to be king.

11
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,532
Show the sword.

12
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:02,244
Behold the sword of power.

13
00:04:03,153 --> 00:04:04,211
Excalibur.

14
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,188
Forged when the world was young...

15
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:13,421
...and bird, and beast, and flower...

16
00:04:13,497 --> 00:04:15,089
...were one with man...

17
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:17,929
...and death was but a dream.

18
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,232
Speak the words.

19
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,830
One land, one king!

20
00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:27,205
That is my peace, Cornwall.

21
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:35,208
Lord Uther,
if I yield to the sword of power...

22
00:04:36,186 --> 00:04:37,517
...what will you yield?

23
00:04:37,587 --> 00:04:38,781
Me, yield?

24
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:41,215
He has given. Now you must.

25
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:47,495
The land from here to the sea
shall be yours...

26
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:50,399
...if you enforce the king's will.

27
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:56,127
Done!

28
00:04:58,341 --> 00:04:59,399
Good.

29
00:04:59,843 --> 00:05:03,108
King Uther, let's feast together.
To my castle.

30
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:13,353
My wife will dance for us.

31
00:05:14,758 --> 00:05:17,056
Igrayne, dance!

32
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:28,595
You may be king, Uther...

33
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:32,165
...but no queen of yours
could ever match her.

34
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:36,697
I must have her.

35
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:38,832
Are you mad? The alliance.

36
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:50,548
I must have her.

37
00:06:51,187 --> 00:06:53,018
And risk everything you've won?

38
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:17,746
King Uther, huh?

39
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,866
You'll never battle this down...

40
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:51,005
...and you'll never have Igrayne!
Never!

41
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:52,277
Never!

42
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:54,510
Merlin! Where are you?

43
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:58,610
- Have you found him?
- I haven't.

44
00:08:01,124 --> 00:08:02,751
He's here, all right.

45
00:08:03,593 --> 00:08:05,424
He won't show himself.

46
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:12,728
Where have you been?

47
00:08:13,503 --> 00:08:15,937
I have walked my way
since the beginning of time.

48
00:08:16,006 --> 00:08:17,940
Sometimes I give, sometimes I take.

49
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:19,942
It is mine to know which and when.

50
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,978
- You must help me, Merlin!
- Must I?

51
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:23,478
I am your king.

52
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:27,444
So you need me again,
now that my truce is wrecked.

53
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:31,144
Years to build and moments to ruin,
and all for lust.

54
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:32,879
For Igrayne.

55
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,482
One night with her.

56
00:08:36,926 --> 00:08:39,417
You don't understand. You're not a man.

57
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,894
Use the magic! Do it!

58
00:08:46,302 --> 00:08:47,792
Igrayne.

59
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:54,136
You will swear by your true kingship...

60
00:08:55,111 --> 00:08:57,807
...to grant me what I wish.

61
00:08:58,314 --> 00:08:59,645
Then you shall have it.

62
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,809
By Excalibur, I swear it.

63
00:09:03,153 --> 00:09:06,680
What issues from your lust shall be mine.

64
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:09,017
Swear it again.

65
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:10,616
I swear it!

66
00:09:20,637 --> 00:09:22,798
They have given up. It's over.

67
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,472
Not quite.

68
00:09:24,707 --> 00:09:27,733
When night falls,
we'll follow them and finish them.

69
00:10:46,523 --> 00:10:47,854
I dreamt of the Dragon.

70
00:10:48,324 --> 00:10:50,258
I have awoken him.

71
00:10:51,294 --> 00:10:54,855
Can't you see all around you
the Dragon's breath?

72
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:17,216
We have drawn him out.

73
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:20,648
The duke is off to pursue your men.

74
00:11:24,427 --> 00:11:26,418
There he goes.

75
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,919
Good.

76
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:29,896
Mount your horse.

77
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:34,394
I will transform you
into the semblance of the duke.

78
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:38,502
Igrayne will think her husband
has returned.

79
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,141
But the cliff, the sea?

80
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:44,903
Your lust will hold you up.

81
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:47,613
You will float on the Dragon's breath.

82
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:49,609
Ride!

83
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:52,885
Ride!

84
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:16,034
Take on the outer shape of the duke.

85
00:12:18,181 --> 00:12:19,409
Change!

86
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:21,640
Transform!

87
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:23,951
Now!

88
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:36,523
That's it.

89
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,125
That's it.

90
00:12:47,343 --> 00:12:48,571
It's the duke.

91
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:52,778
The duke has returned. Open the gates.

92
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:56,279
Have the horse ready.
I ride out before sunrise.

93
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:06,654
Uther!

94
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,157
Find the king. Find Uther.

95
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:18,638
Uther, come out and fight.

96
00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:22,335
We're under attack. It's Cornwall.

97
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:33,349
My father is dead.

98
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:46,092
Hush, Morgana, hush.

99
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,936
My father, my father is dead.

100
00:14:02,018 --> 00:14:03,076
Look.

101
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:04,585
Here's your father.

102
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:07,145
It was just a dream, little one.

103
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,220
Come, Igrayne.

104
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:13,925
Go to sleep.

105
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:25,931
My lord.

106
00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:28,894
The future has taken root in the present.

107
00:15:30,206 --> 00:15:31,230
It is done.

108
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:44,146
When? Where?

109
00:15:44,454 --> 00:15:46,581
In the camp of Uther, my lady...

110
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:48,584
...just after nightfall.

111
00:15:49,826 --> 00:15:51,225
It can't be.

112
00:15:51,761 --> 00:15:53,092
He came to me...

113
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:54,828
...to his bed, last night.

114
00:15:56,232 --> 00:15:57,722
What shall become of us?

115
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,525
Lord Uther, my lady.

116
00:16:01,637 --> 00:16:03,332
It will be for him to say.

117
00:16:06,342 --> 00:16:07,741
Oh, Morgana.

118
00:16:18,454 --> 00:16:19,978
The king. The king.

119
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:21,313
Wait!

120
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:29,954
Out!

121
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:32,765
- What is it, Lady?
- A boy, sir.

122
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:35,571
- Send the girl away.
- She's only a child.

123
00:16:35,638 --> 00:16:37,105
- Out!
- Go, Morgana.

124
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:42,342
She watches me with her father's eyes.

125
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:48,812
Is it mine or his?

126
00:16:50,953 --> 00:16:52,420
A man came to me...

127
00:16:53,356 --> 00:16:54,721
...and loved me...

128
00:16:57,593 --> 00:16:59,220
...and made this child.

129
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:03,627
I thought it was my husband...

130
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:06,665
...but he was already dead.

131
00:17:19,115 --> 00:17:21,345
All I know is how to butcher men.

132
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:25,215
From now on, I shall learn to love them...

133
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,187
...for I am weary of battle.

134
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:35,027
I shall stay by his side...

135
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:38,427
...and his mother's.

136
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,165
He's hungry.

137
00:17:57,653 --> 00:18:00,383
Merlin, you come when you're not asked...

138
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:02,487
...and pay no heed when I call you.

139
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:05,857
Oh, I have slept for nine moons.

140
00:18:06,963 --> 00:18:08,954
What I did for you wasn't easy.

141
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,156
Now you must pay me.

142
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:15,669
The child is mine.

143
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,532
You made an oath.

144
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:22,911
They were hasty words, Merlin.

145
00:18:23,813 --> 00:18:25,508
This is flesh and blood.

146
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,477
Uther, is this true?

147
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:31,719
Don't let him take the child.

148
00:18:31,854 --> 00:18:33,685
I swore an oath, Igrayne.

149
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:35,515
I made a pact with Merlin.

150
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:39,920
It was you!

151
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,027
You came to me that night.

152
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:45,093
You are the father!

153
00:18:46,102 --> 00:18:48,070
It's not for you, Uther...

154
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:51,200
...hearth and home, wife and child.

155
00:18:55,745 --> 00:18:58,714
To kill and be king, is that all?

156
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:00,439
Perhaps not even that.

157
00:19:02,218 --> 00:19:04,709
You strike me with words as hard as steel.

158
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:07,781
You betrayed the duke, you stole his wife...

159
00:19:07,957 --> 00:19:10,949
...you took his castle,
now no one trusts you.

160
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:14,291
You're not the one, Uther.

161
00:19:15,665 --> 00:19:17,064
Give me the child.

162
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:19,529
I will protect him.

163
00:19:28,044 --> 00:19:29,068
No!

164
00:19:30,246 --> 00:19:31,577
Why?

165
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,781
Take him.

166
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:37,113
Take the devil child.

167
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,378
No!

168
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:41,612
Why the baby?

169
00:19:44,794 --> 00:19:47,957
No! Go after him!

170
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:51,165
That's it.

171
00:19:51,934 --> 00:19:53,026
Sleep now.

172
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,267
Go after him!

173
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:56,900
Get him back!

174
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,976
Are you the mother and the father
of the baby now, Merlin?

175
00:20:19,462 --> 00:20:21,123
Where are you?

176
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:28,298
I want my son.

177
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:34,066
Attack!

178
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:37,871
Ambush!

179
00:20:38,214 --> 00:20:40,045
Help me, Ulfius.

180
00:20:48,824 --> 00:20:50,792
The king's bodyguard! Look out!

181
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,919
The king! The king is ambushed!

182
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:14,140
Excalibur.

183
00:21:39,975 --> 00:21:40,942
The sword!

184
00:21:41,377 --> 00:21:42,708
The king's sword.

185
00:21:55,925 --> 00:21:58,485
Merlin, where are you?

186
00:22:00,496 --> 00:22:01,929
Call your Dragon...

187
00:22:02,665 --> 00:22:04,155
...to weave a mist...

188
00:22:05,301 --> 00:22:06,632
...to hide us.

189
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,630
Merlin, where are you?

190
00:22:13,776 --> 00:22:15,607
Nobody shall have the sword.

191
00:22:18,614 --> 00:22:21,481
Nobody shall wield Excalibur...

192
00:22:21,584 --> 00:22:22,710
...but me.

193
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:41,693
Uther!

194
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:47,298
He who draws the sword from the stone,
he shall be king.

195
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:52,236
Arthur...

196
00:22:52,948 --> 00:22:54,313
...you're the one.

197
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:39,653
Now remember, my sons,
what I've told you.

198
00:23:39,728 --> 00:23:42,094
Pay no heed to these robber knights.

199
00:23:42,164 --> 00:23:45,395
You, Kay, be brave and honest
and merciful...

200
00:23:45,868 --> 00:23:47,495
...as a knight should be.

201
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:50,663
And you, Arthur, be modest and true...

202
00:23:51,573 --> 00:23:54,906
...and help your brother
to uphold the good name of Morven.

203
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:31,246
I remember my first joust.

204
00:24:31,313 --> 00:24:33,804
It looks far worse than it feels.

205
00:24:47,329 --> 00:24:50,298
Camolyarde! Camolyarde!

206
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:06,977
God, send us a true king.

207
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:08,615
We are unworthy...

208
00:25:08,784 --> 00:25:11,685
...but the land bleeds, the people suffer.

209
00:25:11,954 --> 00:25:15,014
We have sinned, but on this Easter Day...

210
00:25:15,157 --> 00:25:18,183
...when Christ rose from the dead,
may one knight here...

211
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,423
...through victory in arms find the grace...

212
00:25:21,597 --> 00:25:25,033
...to draw the sword and be king.

213
00:25:27,403 --> 00:25:30,133
By my right of victory...

214
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,371
...by my blood...

215
00:25:34,843 --> 00:25:36,333
...give me the power.

216
00:26:10,846 --> 00:26:14,145
All knights prepare and be ready...

217
00:26:14,716 --> 00:26:18,243
...who would joust for the right
to draw the sword...

218
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,283
...from the stone.

219
00:26:23,459 --> 00:26:26,394
Arthur, where is Kay's sword?

220
00:26:33,202 --> 00:26:36,103
A good squire doesn't forget
his knight's sword.

221
00:26:37,272 --> 00:26:38,534
I left it in the tent, Father.

222
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:40,404
Well hurry then, and get it.

223
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,948
It's stolen.

224
00:27:18,647 --> 00:27:20,137
I'll see what's keeping him.

225
00:27:20,215 --> 00:27:22,615
Well hurry, you'll miss your chance.

226
00:27:51,513 --> 00:27:54,209
Your sword was stolen,
but here is Excalibur.

227
00:27:57,286 --> 00:27:58,310
Kay?

228
00:27:58,854 --> 00:28:01,652
Did you free Excalibur from the stone?

229
00:28:02,424 --> 00:28:03,448
Yes.

230
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:07,092
No, I didn't. Arthur did.

231
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:09,493
The sword! The sword!

232
00:28:09,998 --> 00:28:11,522
You freed it, Arthur?

233
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,000
I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.

234
00:28:17,272 --> 00:28:18,796
You must put it back.

235
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:33,619
Now try to draw it again, Arthur.

236
00:28:35,123 --> 00:28:37,717
Wait! I, Uryens, will try.

237
00:28:38,727 --> 00:28:40,160
Stand back.

238
00:28:48,837 --> 00:28:50,532
Let the boy try.

239
00:28:52,474 --> 00:28:54,374
Let the boy try.

240
00:28:58,714 --> 00:29:01,342
Come on, Arthur. Don't be afraid.

241
00:29:10,192 --> 00:29:13,787
We have our king! Thanks be to God!

242
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,860
Rise, Father, please.

243
00:29:22,938 --> 00:29:25,463
I was your son before I became your king...

244
00:29:25,707 --> 00:29:26,799
...if I am king.

245
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,365
You are king...

246
00:29:29,177 --> 00:29:32,146
...the more so,
because you are not my son...

247
00:29:33,548 --> 00:29:35,516
...and I am not your father.

248
00:29:35,717 --> 00:29:37,275
Not my father?

249
00:29:37,452 --> 00:29:39,215
Then Kay is not my brother?

250
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:43,918
Merlin the magician brought you to me
when you were newly born...

251
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:47,223
...and bade me raise you as my own.

252
00:29:48,196 --> 00:29:51,359
At first I did so because I feared Merlin,
but later...

253
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,792
...because I loved you.

254
00:29:54,069 --> 00:29:55,627
Who is my true father?

255
00:29:56,138 --> 00:29:58,106
Only Merlin can tell you that.

256
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,605
And who is Merlin?

257
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:03,068
I am Merlin.

258
00:30:04,112 --> 00:30:05,579
Whose son am I?

259
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:10,209
You are the son of Uther and Igrayne...

260
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,212
...you are King Arthur.

261
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:17,654
We haven't forgotten you.
What trickery is this?

262
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,699
He's trying to foist
a fatherless boy upon us.

263
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,398
Do you want a bastard as a king?

264
00:30:27,803 --> 00:30:30,135
Lord Leondegrance,
join us against the boy.

265
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:32,036
I saw what I saw.

266
00:30:32,841 --> 00:30:34,832
The boy drew the sword.

267
00:30:35,777 --> 00:30:38,575
If a boy has been chosen...

268
00:30:39,181 --> 00:30:41,240
...a boy shall be king.

269
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:43,476
No, I challenge that.

270
00:30:43,618 --> 00:30:45,552
The sword has been drawn.

271
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:49,786
Are you with us or against us?

272
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:52,784
Against you.

273
00:31:32,067 --> 00:31:33,125
Why have you done this to me?

274
00:31:33,201 --> 00:31:35,101
Because you were born to be king.

275
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,432
What does it mean to be king?

276
00:31:36,505 --> 00:31:38,996
You will be the land,
and the land will be you.

277
00:31:39,074 --> 00:31:41,508
If you fail, the land will perish.

278
00:31:41,576 --> 00:31:43,840
As you thrive, the land will blossom.

279
00:31:43,912 --> 00:31:45,812
- Why?
- Because you are king.

280
00:31:45,981 --> 00:31:46,970
No!

281
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,504
- What are you afraid of?
- I don't know.

282
00:33:20,609 --> 00:33:23,407
- Shall I tell you what's out there?
- Yes, please.

283
00:33:23,512 --> 00:33:24,604
The Dragon.

284
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,711
A beast of such power...

285
00:33:26,982 --> 00:33:31,316
...that if you were to see it whole
and complete in a single glance...

286
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:33,320
...it would burn you to cinders.

287
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:35,652
- Where is it?
- It is everywhere.

288
00:33:35,957 --> 00:33:37,584
It is everything.

289
00:33:37,692 --> 00:33:40,490
Its scales glisten in the bark of trees.

290
00:33:40,595 --> 00:33:43,029
Its roar is heard in the wind.

291
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:45,123
And its forked tongue strikes like....

292
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:50,162
Like lightning. Yes, that's it.

293
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:52,806
How can I...?

294
00:33:52,874 --> 00:33:54,671
What shall I...? Must I...?

295
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:56,005
Do nothing.

296
00:33:56,678 --> 00:33:58,168
Be still. Sleep.

297
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:02,049
Rest in the arms of the Dragon.

298
00:34:03,685 --> 00:34:05,209
Dream.

299
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,836
Excalibur. It's part of the Dragon, too.

300
00:34:25,407 --> 00:34:26,601
Oh, yes.

301
00:34:27,509 --> 00:34:29,101
Oh, you learn quickly.

302
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:30,578
That's good.

303
00:34:30,812 --> 00:34:31,938
I like that.

304
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:36,250
What kind of man was my father?

305
00:34:37,018 --> 00:34:39,885
Oh, he was brave, he was strong.

306
00:34:40,088 --> 00:34:41,419
He was a great knight.

307
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:42,956
Was he a great king?

308
00:34:43,758 --> 00:34:45,953
Well, he was rash.

309
00:34:46,061 --> 00:34:48,894
He never learned
how to look into men's hearts.

310
00:34:49,097 --> 00:34:50,621
Least of all his own.

311
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:51,893
You loved him?

312
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:55,300
Well, it is easy to love folly in a child.

313
00:34:57,172 --> 00:35:00,505
Merlin, will you help me to be wise,
not to be rash?

314
00:35:02,844 --> 00:35:04,175
Where are you going?

315
00:35:04,245 --> 00:35:07,339
Where do you think?
You have a kingdom to rule.

316
00:35:07,415 --> 00:35:09,883
But how? I don't know how.

317
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:12,811
You knew how to draw the sword
from the stone.

318
00:35:12,887 --> 00:35:14,479
- That was easy.
- Was it?

319
00:35:14,556 --> 00:35:15,955
I couldn't have done it.

320
00:35:16,024 --> 00:35:16,991
You couldn't?

321
00:35:17,058 --> 00:35:18,685
You're the king, not I.

322
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,954
But where to start?

323
00:35:20,028 --> 00:35:23,020
Well, what do you think has happened
since you ran off?

324
00:35:23,098 --> 00:35:26,556
Sir Ector and Kay.
They must be waiting all this time.

325
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:31,400
Most of the great knights were against me.
Except Leondegrance of Camelyarde.

326
00:35:31,606 --> 00:35:34,166
But if he supports me,
the others will turn against him.

327
00:35:34,242 --> 00:35:36,676
Even now they lay siege to his castle.

328
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:38,437
I need him. We must help him.

329
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:39,639
There you are.

330
00:35:39,714 --> 00:35:41,614
That was easy, too, wasn't it?

331
00:35:41,683 --> 00:35:43,378
We have to get back.

332
00:35:43,451 --> 00:35:44,645
That's it.

333
00:35:45,053 --> 00:35:46,111
Now....

334
00:35:46,755 --> 00:35:47,779
There they are.

335
00:35:52,394 --> 00:35:54,328
Well, you go and show them.

336
00:35:56,798 --> 00:35:59,995
Arthur, I knew you wouldn't fail us.

337
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:01,035
Go on.

338
00:36:01,469 --> 00:36:03,699
I picked out a horse for you.

339
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:07,631
All these men are loyal.
Now what do you want us to do?

340
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,108
We waited here for you.

341
00:36:09,177 --> 00:36:11,645
Any man who would be a knight...

342
00:36:12,947 --> 00:36:15,313
...and follow a king, follow me.

343
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,078
Where to? Where are we going?

344
00:36:17,152 --> 00:36:19,211
Leondegrance, his castle is under siege.

345
00:36:19,754 --> 00:36:21,119
Guenevere, get back.

346
00:36:21,189 --> 00:36:23,316
You're beaten, Leondegrance.

347
00:36:54,155 --> 00:36:55,281
Get the hook.

348
00:37:02,597 --> 00:37:03,757
Throw the rope.

349
00:37:36,998 --> 00:37:38,124
That's good.

350
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:04,121
That's it.

351
00:38:04,192 --> 00:38:06,888
Now round the other side.
Uryens is attacking.

352
00:38:17,105 --> 00:38:18,470
Go on!

353
00:38:18,573 --> 00:38:19,870
Go on!

354
00:38:27,749 --> 00:38:28,681
Father!

355
00:38:30,118 --> 00:38:32,211
Hold on! Hold on!

356
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:49,034
Take the knights in the moat.
Hold them off. Hold them off.

357
00:38:49,804 --> 00:38:51,499
I'm going for the ladder.

358
00:39:14,796 --> 00:39:16,161
Father, look.

359
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:20,432
It's the boy king.

360
00:40:08,483 --> 00:40:10,178
Behind you.

361
00:40:20,728 --> 00:40:24,095
Swear faith to me
and you shall have mercy.

362
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:26,759
I need battle lords such as you.

363
00:40:26,901 --> 00:40:30,598
A noble knight swear faith to a squire?

364
00:40:31,406 --> 00:40:33,340
Never, never!

365
00:40:40,615 --> 00:40:43,140
You are right. I'm not yet a knight.

366
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,083
You, Uryens, will knight me.

367
00:40:50,591 --> 00:40:53,651
Then, as knight to knight,
I can offer you mercy.

368
00:40:57,065 --> 00:40:58,362
What's this?

369
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,431
What's this?

370
00:41:09,577 --> 00:41:11,738
Keep it, Uryens.

371
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:25,618
In the name of God,
Saint Michael and Saint George...

372
00:41:25,793 --> 00:41:29,524
...I give you the right to bear arms
and the power to meet justice.

373
00:41:30,064 --> 00:41:32,328
That duty I will solemnly obey...

374
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:34,467
...as knight and king.

375
00:41:35,136 --> 00:41:36,967
I never saw this.

376
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:40,071
Rise, King Arthur.

377
00:41:42,877 --> 00:41:44,674
I am your humble knight...

378
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,679
...and I swear allegiance
to the courage in your veins...

379
00:41:49,017 --> 00:41:50,814
...so strong it is...

380
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,247
...its source must be Uther Pendgragon.

381
00:41:54,956 --> 00:41:56,947
I doubt you no more.

382
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,852
- It didn't hurt too much, did it?
- No.

383
00:42:28,523 --> 00:42:31,048
I've sewn my father's wounds
more than once.

384
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,658
Careful! You'll tear them open.

385
00:42:40,868 --> 00:42:42,699
You'll have to stay still and rest.

386
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:43,896
How long?

387
00:42:45,473 --> 00:42:46,872
A few days.

388
00:43:07,929 --> 00:43:09,829
- Oh, no!
- What is it?

389
00:43:09,897 --> 00:43:11,262
The stitches.

390
00:43:11,966 --> 00:43:13,331
It's all right.

391
00:43:14,435 --> 00:43:16,995
Come on, come on. Dance.

392
00:43:30,451 --> 00:43:32,442
A king must marry, after all.

393
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,349
So it seems.

394
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,856
I love her. If only she'd be my queen....

395
00:43:46,934 --> 00:43:49,266
Merlin, can you make her love me?

396
00:43:50,138 --> 00:43:51,332
Now, look.

397
00:43:51,506 --> 00:43:53,565
I once stood exposed
to the Dragon's breath...

398
00:43:53,641 --> 00:43:55,506
...so a man could lie one night
with a woman.

399
00:43:55,576 --> 00:43:58,272
It took me nine moons to recover...

400
00:43:58,346 --> 00:44:00,507
...and all for this lunacy called love...

401
00:44:00,581 --> 00:44:03,846
...this mad distemper,
that strikes down both beggar and king.

402
00:44:03,918 --> 00:44:05,385
Never again!

403
00:44:06,387 --> 00:44:07,411
Never!

404
00:44:14,629 --> 00:44:17,621
Who will I marry then?
You can tell me that at least.

405
00:44:17,965 --> 00:44:19,296
What do you see?

406
00:44:25,873 --> 00:44:28,103
Oh, Guenevere.

407
00:44:30,878 --> 00:44:33,711
And a beloved friend who will betray you.

408
00:44:35,883 --> 00:44:39,375
You're not listening. Your heart is not.
Love is deaf as well as blind.

409
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:47,354
You have a land to quell before you can...

410
00:44:47,428 --> 00:44:50,192
...start all this hair pulling
and jumping about.

411
00:44:57,738 --> 00:44:59,603
I've made these only for you.

412
00:45:00,141 --> 00:45:03,633
I've mixed into them things
that will heal you, but not too quickly...

413
00:45:03,711 --> 00:45:07,044
...and they'll make you a little sleepy
so you can't escape.

414
00:45:07,448 --> 00:45:08,540
What's in them?

415
00:45:08,616 --> 00:45:10,447
It is an ancient mixture...

416
00:45:10,685 --> 00:45:12,550
...soft, unborn grains...

417
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,820
...flavored with rose petals.

418
00:45:16,157 --> 00:45:17,317
The rest is secret.

419
00:45:25,766 --> 00:45:28,599
Looking at the cake is like
looking at the future.

420
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,570
Until you have tasted it,
what do you really know?

421
00:45:31,672 --> 00:45:34,368
And then, of course, it's too late.

422
00:45:37,745 --> 00:45:38,769
Too late.

423
00:45:55,429 --> 00:45:58,057
We have won battles. Against armies.

424
00:45:58,466 --> 00:46:01,264
And now one man defeats all my knights.

425
00:46:04,038 --> 00:46:06,666
He's a mighty opponent.

426
00:46:11,646 --> 00:46:12,908
A hard man.

427
00:46:13,514 --> 00:46:14,572
I'll go myself.

428
00:46:14,649 --> 00:46:17,880
The king must not engage
in single combat. I'll go again.

429
00:46:18,019 --> 00:46:19,247
No, I will.

430
00:46:32,433 --> 00:46:34,628
Merlin, who is this knight?

431
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:37,168
Look at him.

432
00:46:37,505 --> 00:46:38,767
So beautiful.

433
00:46:39,073 --> 00:46:39,835
So quick.

434
00:46:54,255 --> 00:46:55,415
Remember...

435
00:46:55,556 --> 00:46:58,047
...there's always someone cleverer
than yourself.

436
00:47:10,004 --> 00:47:12,438
Move aside. This is the king's road...

437
00:47:12,506 --> 00:47:15,373
...and the knights you joined arms against
were his very own.

438
00:47:15,443 --> 00:47:16,876
I await the king himself.

439
00:47:17,211 --> 00:47:19,076
His knights are in need of training.

440
00:47:19,146 --> 00:47:21,512
I am king, and this...

441
00:47:23,184 --> 00:47:24,776
...is Excalibur...

442
00:47:25,052 --> 00:47:27,486
...sword of kings from the dawn of time.

443
00:47:27,555 --> 00:47:28,954
Who are you? What do you seek?

444
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:32,618
I am Lancelot of the Lake,
from across the sea.

445
00:47:32,993 --> 00:47:35,518
And I have yet to find a king
worthy of my sword.

446
00:47:36,163 --> 00:47:39,326
That is a wild boast.
You lack a knight's humility.

447
00:47:40,034 --> 00:47:42,400
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.

448
00:47:43,704 --> 00:47:46,468
For I have never met my match
in joust or duel.

449
00:47:47,842 --> 00:47:48,934
Move aside!

450
00:47:49,577 --> 00:47:50,544
I will not.

451
00:47:50,945 --> 00:47:52,378
You must retreat...

452
00:47:52,646 --> 00:47:55,809
...or prove your worth in the test of arms
under the eyes of God.

453
00:47:56,417 --> 00:47:59,011
Then may He give me the strength
to unhorse you...

454
00:47:59,086 --> 00:48:01,884
...and send you with one blow
back across the sea.

455
00:48:02,056 --> 00:48:03,387
Then come across, sir.

456
00:48:37,591 --> 00:48:40,116
You joust well, sir.
I offer you another lance.

457
00:48:40,594 --> 00:48:42,562
Yes. Yes. Another lance.

458
00:49:10,825 --> 00:49:11,814
Sword!

459
00:49:18,732 --> 00:49:19,664
Yield, sir.

460
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,061
- I have the advantage.
- I will not.

461
00:49:22,269 --> 00:49:26,672
Fight me, on your horse or on foot,
but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.

462
00:49:27,842 --> 00:49:30,276
I sought only not to harm you.

463
00:49:53,434 --> 00:49:55,527
Your rage has unbalanced you.

464
00:49:58,205 --> 00:50:02,335
You, sir, would fight to the death
against a knight who is not your enemy.

465
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:05,602
For a stretch of road
you could easily ride around.

466
00:50:05,713 --> 00:50:08,238
So be it, to the death.

467
00:51:15,716 --> 00:51:17,206
Excalibur...

468
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:19,952
...I call...

469
00:51:20,154 --> 00:51:21,883
...on your power.

470
00:51:41,542 --> 00:51:43,203
Merlin, what have I done?

471
00:51:46,046 --> 00:51:47,570
You have broken...

472
00:51:48,749 --> 00:51:50,376
...what could not be broken.

473
00:51:53,587 --> 00:51:57,079
Hope is broken.

474
00:51:58,892 --> 00:52:00,757
My pride broke it.

475
00:52:01,261 --> 00:52:03,229
My rage broke it.

476
00:52:07,234 --> 00:52:09,134
This excellent knight...

477
00:52:09,203 --> 00:52:12,297
...who fought with fairness and grace
was meant to win.

478
00:52:13,273 --> 00:52:15,901
I used Excalibur to change that verdict.

479
00:52:17,011 --> 00:52:21,243
I have lost for all time
the ancient sword of my father...

480
00:52:21,415 --> 00:52:24,748
...whose power was meant
to unite all men...

481
00:52:25,152 --> 00:52:28,212
...not to serve the vanity of a single man.

482
00:52:30,257 --> 00:52:32,555
I am nothing.

483
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:50,875
The Lady of the Lake.

484
00:52:53,213 --> 00:52:54,544
Take it!

485
00:53:02,556 --> 00:53:03,614
Excalibur.

486
00:53:04,692 --> 00:53:05,818
Is it true?

487
00:53:05,926 --> 00:53:07,587
Take it! Quickly!

488
00:54:02,649 --> 00:54:04,947
Thanks be to God, you're alive.

489
00:54:05,919 --> 00:54:09,252
I, the best knight in the world, bested!

490
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:11,580
This is a great day.

491
00:54:12,493 --> 00:54:15,587
For my search is over, my king.

492
00:54:17,431 --> 00:54:18,796
Make me your champion.

493
00:54:18,866 --> 00:54:21,027
But your life and lands are far from here.

494
00:54:21,101 --> 00:54:23,160
I give up my castles and my lands.

495
00:54:23,237 --> 00:54:25,034
Here is my domain...

496
00:54:25,806 --> 00:54:27,706
...within this metal skin.

497
00:54:27,875 --> 00:54:30,275
And I pledge all that I still own:

498
00:54:30,744 --> 00:54:35,044
Muscle, bone, blood,
and the heart that pumps it.

499
00:54:35,482 --> 00:54:37,143
And a great heart it is.

500
00:54:37,451 --> 00:54:39,976
Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.

501
00:55:08,448 --> 00:55:11,144
We killed every one of them!
Burnt their ships!

502
00:55:11,351 --> 00:55:13,251
Lancelot, how'd you fare in the North?

503
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,551
We spared a few to tell what fate they met
at the hands of Arthur.

504
00:55:16,623 --> 00:55:18,420
- And you, Uryens?
- Victory!

505
00:55:18,492 --> 00:55:19,356
Lot, and you?

506
00:55:19,426 --> 00:55:21,326
We drove the invaders back into the sea.

507
00:55:21,395 --> 00:55:22,362
Gawain, you?

508
00:55:22,429 --> 00:55:23,862
The East is ours again.

509
00:55:23,931 --> 00:55:26,092
The West is free and with us.

510
00:55:28,101 --> 00:55:30,035
The wars are over!

511
00:55:30,103 --> 00:55:32,298
One land, one king!

512
00:55:32,739 --> 00:55:33,831
Peace!

513
00:55:37,544 --> 00:55:39,171
Stand back!

514
00:55:40,514 --> 00:55:41,742
Be silent.

515
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,042
Be still.

516
00:55:52,192 --> 00:55:53,250
That's it.

517
00:55:54,628 --> 00:55:56,323
And look upon this moment.

518
00:55:56,997 --> 00:55:58,225
Savor it.

519
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:01,029
Rejoice with great gladness.

520
00:56:01,935 --> 00:56:03,197
Great gladness.

521
00:56:03,971 --> 00:56:05,802
Remember it, always...

522
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,371
...for you are joined by it.

523
00:56:09,009 --> 00:56:12,035
You are one, under the stars.

524
00:56:15,048 --> 00:56:18,245
Remember it well then, this night...

525
00:56:19,219 --> 00:56:21,312
...this great victory...

526
00:56:22,289 --> 00:56:25,224
...so that in the years ahead you can say:

527
00:56:25,893 --> 00:56:29,260
'"I was there that night,
with Arthur, the king.'"

528
00:56:34,968 --> 00:56:38,096
For it is the doom of men that they forget.

529
00:56:44,177 --> 00:56:46,645
Your wisdom has forged this ring.

530
00:56:48,315 --> 00:56:51,807
Hereafter,
so that we remember our bonds...

531
00:56:52,653 --> 00:56:55,144
...we shall always come together
in a circle...

532
00:56:55,222 --> 00:56:58,658
...to hear and tell of deeds good and brave.

533
00:57:00,961 --> 00:57:03,395
I will build a round table...

534
00:57:03,463 --> 00:57:05,727
...where this fellowship shall meet.

535
00:57:05,832 --> 00:57:07,891
And a hall about the table.

536
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:10,635
And a castle about the hall.

537
00:57:11,571 --> 00:57:13,129
And I will marry.

538
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:20,076
And the land will have an heir
to wield Excalibur.

539
00:57:24,051 --> 00:57:26,952
Knights of the Round Table.

540
00:57:39,866 --> 00:57:41,731
It's Sir Lancelot.

541
00:57:51,478 --> 00:57:53,469
Lancelot, welcome.

542
00:57:54,314 --> 00:57:55,838
This is a great day.

543
00:57:56,683 --> 00:57:59,584
Everything is prepared.
We'll leave at dawn.

544
00:58:02,055 --> 00:58:03,317
Guenevere...

545
00:58:05,192 --> 00:58:08,889
...here is Arthur's greatest knight
come to escort you to the king.

546
00:59:06,953 --> 00:59:08,887
They want me to ask you if...

547
00:59:09,056 --> 00:59:11,422
...any one of them could win your heart.

548
00:59:11,792 --> 00:59:13,316
I'm a fighting man.

549
00:59:13,627 --> 00:59:15,288
I'm sworn to the Quest.

550
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:20,757
But surely there must be some lady
somewhere in the world who inspires you?

551
00:59:21,401 --> 00:59:22,595
There is one.

552
00:59:24,404 --> 00:59:25,598
Who is she?

553
00:59:26,206 --> 00:59:27,639
Oh, go on, tell me.

554
00:59:29,042 --> 00:59:30,009
You.

555
00:59:31,578 --> 00:59:33,068
You're teasing me.

556
00:59:33,447 --> 00:59:35,142
I will love you always.

557
00:59:35,849 --> 00:59:37,646
I will love you as my queen...

558
00:59:37,717 --> 00:59:40,117
...and as the wife of my best friend...

559
00:59:40,487 --> 00:59:42,182
...and while you live...

560
00:59:43,123 --> 00:59:45,148
...I will love no other.

561
01:00:21,728 --> 01:00:23,719
By the blood of Jesus Christ...

562
01:00:24,931 --> 01:00:26,660
...I join you in marriage.

563
01:00:29,803 --> 01:00:32,237
Man to woman.

564
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:36,468
King to queen.

565
01:00:39,746 --> 01:00:42,442
Arthur to Guenevere.

566
01:01:01,701 --> 01:01:03,692
Don't you know me, Lord Merlin?

567
01:01:04,538 --> 01:01:06,403
Morgana of Cornwall.

568
01:01:08,475 --> 01:01:10,306
You have your father's eyes.

569
01:01:11,411 --> 01:01:12,673
I remember you.

570
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,647
When my brother, Arthur, was born
you came and took him away.

571
01:01:17,884 --> 01:01:19,852
And now you leave his wedding.

572
01:01:20,887 --> 01:01:22,946
Because I am a creature like you.

573
01:01:25,992 --> 01:01:27,653
What is the stone that burns?

574
01:01:27,727 --> 01:01:29,991
Sulphur. To mix with mercury.

575
01:01:30,864 --> 01:01:32,354
What is that root?

576
01:01:39,406 --> 01:01:40,430
Mandrake.

577
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:45,906
The essence of it
can prolong the act of love.

578
01:01:46,313 --> 01:01:48,008
And if too much is taken?

579
01:01:48,248 --> 01:01:49,374
Pain and death.

580
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:51,008
That's it.

581
01:01:51,851 --> 01:01:54,411
Oh, you do know something of the Art.

582
01:01:55,755 --> 01:01:57,052
Do you have the sight?

583
01:01:57,290 --> 01:01:58,552
Do you see the future?

584
01:01:58,625 --> 01:02:01,219
Sometimes, I dream of things
that come to pass.

585
01:02:01,661 --> 01:02:02,787
Look now.

586
01:02:02,862 --> 01:02:04,056
What do you see?

587
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:05,495
What will be?

588
01:02:06,766 --> 01:02:08,927
I see a castle of silver and gold.

589
01:02:09,169 --> 01:02:10,101
Up there.

590
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:13,003
No, that plan is well-known.

591
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,968
You'll have to do better than that.

592
01:02:26,853 --> 01:02:28,844
It is a lonely way, you know.

593
01:02:29,155 --> 01:02:30,952
The way of the Necromancer.

594
01:02:31,091 --> 01:02:33,787
Yes, to know too much...

595
01:02:34,361 --> 01:02:35,988
<i>...lacrimae mundae...</i>

596
01:02:36,263 --> 01:02:37,958
...the tears of the world.

597
01:02:38,031 --> 01:02:40,397
But the power? The joy?

598
01:02:40,467 --> 01:02:42,435
Moments. Fleeting moments.

599
01:02:42,936 --> 01:02:44,767
I can ease your loneliness.

600
01:02:45,038 --> 01:02:46,903
Let me help you. Teach me.

601
01:02:48,642 --> 01:02:51,133
The days of our kind are numbered.

602
01:02:52,846 --> 01:02:56,441
The one God comes to drive out
the many gods.

603
01:02:57,183 --> 01:02:59,549
The spirits of wood and stream...

604
01:03:00,053 --> 01:03:01,315
...grow silent.

605
01:03:02,489 --> 01:03:04,787
It's the way of things. Yes.

606
01:03:06,926 --> 01:03:09,724
It's a time for men and their ways.

607
01:04:12,192 --> 01:04:14,057
Run home to your mother, boy.

608
01:05:05,245 --> 01:05:06,940
Take me with you.

609
01:05:08,148 --> 01:05:09,740
I want to be a knight.

610
01:05:11,484 --> 01:05:13,111
I'll find food for you.

611
01:05:14,154 --> 01:05:15,985
Did you like the rabbit?

612
01:05:17,857 --> 01:05:21,315
Do you know what it means
to serve a knight who serves a king?

613
01:05:22,328 --> 01:05:23,158
Jump up.

614
01:05:23,863 --> 01:05:25,023
I'll run.

615
01:05:26,533 --> 01:05:27,761
Listen boy...

616
01:05:27,867 --> 01:05:29,767
...it's more than 20 days from here.

617
01:05:30,003 --> 01:05:32,301
Twenty days! The world's not that big.

618
01:05:39,479 --> 01:05:40,776
What's that?

619
01:05:40,847 --> 01:05:42,906
Camelot, the king's castle.

620
01:05:52,091 --> 01:05:52,819
Cavalry!

621
01:05:52,892 --> 01:05:54,257
Lancelot, welcome.

622
01:05:54,327 --> 01:05:55,658
Hey, Lot.

623
01:05:55,728 --> 01:05:58,959
Hey, Lancelot. Great to see you.

624
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,021
Will you train this lad to be my squire?

625
01:06:29,095 --> 01:06:30,892
Who'll give me my armor and sword?

626
01:06:32,332 --> 01:06:35,597
Kitchen knives and greasy spits
shall be your weapons, boy.

627
01:06:35,702 --> 01:06:37,033
To the kitchens.

628
01:06:43,142 --> 01:06:44,200
Look!

629
01:06:48,581 --> 01:06:49,479
Staying?

630
01:06:50,216 --> 01:06:52,480
There's a meeting of the Round Table.

631
01:07:01,227 --> 01:07:02,558
No. I can't.

632
01:07:26,953 --> 01:07:28,113
Sorry, old fellow.

633
01:07:28,187 --> 01:07:30,655
What're you doing here?
This is no place for an old man.

634
01:07:30,723 --> 01:07:32,384
I built it, dullard.

635
01:07:32,592 --> 01:07:35,925
- All on your own?
- Yes, and for the likes of you, it seems.

636
01:07:35,995 --> 01:07:39,021
Oh, well, then you can tell me
the way to the kitchen.

637
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:41,530
Follow your nose.

638
01:08:07,393 --> 01:08:08,724
I'm dreaming.

639
01:08:10,096 --> 01:08:11,620
I must be dreaming.

640
01:08:11,764 --> 01:08:13,459
Get away from there, boy.
