[Girl]
I wanna be the best surfer
in the world.

00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,645
[Child Giggles]

4
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,526
[Child]
I'm gonna be the best surfer
in the world, not you.

5
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,931
[Man]
She's just slotted in there.
Look at that wave.

6
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,034
Anne Marie Chadwick getting
the best wave of the day.

7
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,616
[Man]
Anne Marie...

00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,693

12
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:04,574
[Man's Voice] Hey, howzit,
wave riders. It's hump day,
Wednesday, February 3.

13
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,176
Waves are averaging 14 feet
in 18 seconds.

14
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:11,485
So there's definitely some
size out there in the water,
and it's moving our way.

15
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,583
There's a little bit of morning
sickness out right now,

16
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,855
but it should clean up
as the winds pick up...

17
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,866
[Dialing]

[Phone Ringing]

19
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,255
[Man] It's flat.
Yeah, right.
I'm looking at it.

20
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,951
Anne Marie?
What's up,J.J.?

21
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:49,256
Tell Eden she's a hottie.
Hook me up.

22
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,162
Tell her yourself.
How's Pipe looking?

23
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,929
Ho! It's going off.
It's at least double overhead.

24
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,300
- You better get down here.
- Okay. Thanks, J.J.

25
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,534
Pen. Pen, come on.
Get up.

26
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:05,942
Pen. Get up.
It's double overhead.

27
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:09,971
# Could you be loved #

28
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,210
# And be loved #
Lena. Hey, Lena.

29
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,379
What?
It's double overhead.

30
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,947
- What?
- # Could you be loved #

31
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,721
# And be loved #

32
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:25,821
##[Continues]
How's it coming?

33
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,924
I can't get the rails right.
They're too pinched.

34
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,733
You wanna get wet?
I got to glass before work.

35
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,501
It's perfect Pipe.

36
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,567
For real?
For real.

37
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,375
- Move it.
- Yeah, move it.

38
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,746
- Move. Let's go.
- Let's do it.

39
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,546
Okay, got my noodles.
Let's go.

40
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,417
##[Continues]

41
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,522
[Woman]
Turn it up.

42
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,229
# Could you be loved #

43
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,936
- Whoo!
- # And be loved #

44
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,032
[Lena]
It's going off!

45
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:13,545
# Could you be loved #

46
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,313
# And be loved #

##[Continues]

48
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,280
What's up, bro?

49
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,624
Great.
The Rat Pack's here.

50
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,633
Hey, what's up, guys?

51
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,965
Hey, Rico, what's up?
Hey, girls.

52
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,061
We should have
been here an hour ago.

53
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:42,107
If you would have gotten
moving, we would have been.
We're all right.

54
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,167
What's up, Tamayo?
Hey, how's it, girls?

55
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:49,806
How is it out there?
Oh, it's pretty nuts.
Broke my board.

56
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:55,314
It's pretty heavy out there.
Your girl got her head
on straight this time?

57
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,822
Does she?
You know it.

58
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,759
[Shouting, Whooping]

59
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,275
- Oh, look who's here.
- What are you girls doing here?

60
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:29,151
We came to surf Pipe.
Why don't you check out
girlie bowls?

61
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,656
Why don't you crawl back
into the cave you came from?

62
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,591
Why don't I knock you
in the head, drag you
in there with me? Huh?

63
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,754
I like girls that
are rough and soft inside.

64
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,196
I'm gonna have
to marry you, girl.
Let her go.

65
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,257
Seriously, let her go.
We're out of here.
Okay.

66
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,769
What's this I hear about
you surfing the Pipe Masters?

67
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,771
It's a surfing contest,
not a drowning contest.

68
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,502
Hey, stop hassling my girl.
She's gonna dominate.
Let's see it.

69
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,510
I don't mind girls
that can charge Pipe.

70
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,512
Chick thinks she can
charge Pipe. That's cool.

71
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,878
You think you can
surf it for real?

72
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,112
I dated you, Drew.
I guess I can do anything, huh?

73
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,678
I'll get my boys out there.
We'll block every wave you want.

74
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,657
No matter how big it is,
we want you on it.
Let's see what's gonna happen.

75
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:10,958
- Let's do it.
- Don't talk bubbles to me.
Lets see it.

76
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,865
##[Rock]

77
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,172
So meet us
at the shower at 7:45?
Okay.

78
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:25,210
And stay on the inside.
Be careful, Pen.
Okay. All right.

79
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,406
[Shouting, Whooping]

80
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,989
[Anne Marie]
Oh. Looks like the reef's
breaking down.

81
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,026
Oh, he got shut down.

82
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:00,100
It's heavy out there.
It's fierce.

83
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:09,050
Ohh.!
[Lena]
Oh, he hit the reef.

84
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,449
That's gotta hurt.

85
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,963
I think we should
start at the sandbar
and work our way over.

86
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,021
I won't
argue with that.

87
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,872

# So we're walking
across the beach
Bumpin' MBug tunes #

101
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:10,413
# When we spot three lovely

102
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:13,281
# They looked at me
with sad faces
Every day they'd say to me #

103
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:17,482
# Hot summer streets
and the pavements are burning #

Whatcha thinking #

106
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:27,325
# Trying to smile, but the air
is so heavy and dry #

107
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,027
# I don't give a f...
Need a new rush #

# Let me get a hold

with the new stuff #

# Strange voices are saying #
# Strange voices #

110
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:39,200
# What did they say
Things I can't understand #
# What did I say #

111
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,508
# Tough luck #
# It's too close for comfort #

# This heat has got

116
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:01,593
I want to get a boat so we can
go around the island and get
some killer secret spots.

117
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,862
Guaranteed.
There's so many.
Oh, God, I know.

118
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,565
Hey!
What's this horseshit
on the sandbar crap?

119
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,336
You're not gonna
win the Masters
surfing the sandbar.

120
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,242
Talking this crap on the beach.
"I dated you, Drew.
I can do anything."

121
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:17,009
This isn't Pipe.
Pipe's over there.
Let's go.

122
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,517
The Pipe's over there.
The boys are gonna
block for you.

123
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,247
Let's do this.
Let's go.

124
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,312
Come on.

125
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,857
Whoo! Yeah!

126
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,968
Let's go, man.

127
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,175
Actions speak
louder than words.

128
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,748
Oh, that's the view
I remember.
What, the one of me leaving?

129
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,583
It's my favorite too.

130
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,386
[Drew]
Come on, pick it up.

131
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,930
Like that wave, huh?
Next one's yours.

132
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,783
Welcome to the arena, girl.
Let's get you
into something big.

133
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,322
[Man] What's up, Anne Marie?
Where you been?
Thought you were behind us.

134
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,688
Today's your big day.
Let's do it.

135
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,956
[Drew] Hey, everybody,
this is my girl, Anne Marie.
She's with the boys.

136
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,261
She's gonna get some waves.
Any of you get in her way,
you're gonna deal with me.

137
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:45,326
Here we go.
Paddle.! Paddle.!
Come on.! Move.!

138
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:48,567
Watch out.! Watch out.!
Spring girl's wave.
Hit it.!

139
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,571
Come on! Paddle in!

140
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,513
- Come on!
- Paddle.! Paddle.! Paddle.!

141
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,486
What the hell is that?

142
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,593
- God.! You ain't even paddling.
- Girls can't surf Pipe.

143
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:16,658
What the hell was that?
What the hell is she afraid of?

144
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,500
[Chattering]

145
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:25,767
- This ain't a beauty pageant.
- Oh, if you do that again,
you're barred.

146
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,609
Come on, Anne Marie,
you got to do it this time.
No fooling around.

147
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,672
Let's do it.

148
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,990
This one's yours right here.
Don't blow it. Or I ain't
gonna help you anymore.

149
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,960
Come on. Paddle, paddle.!
This one's yours, Anne Marie.!
Go.! Go.!

150
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,864
[Man]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.!

151
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,598
Ohh!

152
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,580
[Eden] You were in the perfect
spot. You were right where
you needed to be.

153
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,751
[Lena] Whatever.
That thing was a beast.
Just dropped out.

154
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,761
[Penny]
How big was it?

155
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:20,321
[Lena]
It was solid. It was,
like, triple overhead.

156
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,994
She totally had it.
Yeah. She just needed
to paddle a little harder.

157
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,230
[Lena]
I don't know.

158
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,433
[Eden]
It's all in your head.
It's all up here.

159
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,944
If you just
would have committed,
you could have made that wave.

160
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,173
Whatever.
At least she went.
That wave was huge.

161
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,182
- I would have never gone.
- [Eden]
She was perfectly positioned.

162
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,616
If she had the balls to charge...
[Penny] Why does the sun
rise in the east?

163
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,587
What?
Why does the sun
rise in the east?

164
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,783
Because it sets
in the west.

165
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,792
Because that's the way
the Earth rotates.

166
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,488
Do you remember
that Superman episode...

167
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:54,363
where he was, like, spinning
around the Earth backwards...

168
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,027
trying to rotate it
in the other direction?

169
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,297
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
To bring back time?

170
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:02,238
- I thought you finished.
- I did. I'm just checking it.

171
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,742
- It doesn't look like
you're finished.
- Geez. Stop picking on her.

172
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,710
She's getting it done now.

173
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,942
[Anne Marie]
We're on our way to school.
She should have it done.

174
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,644
- She's just checking it.
- I did it last night.
I'm checking it.

175
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,286
[Anne Marie]
Penny.! Penny.!
What?

176
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,918
Flippers.

177
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,985
- No ditching.
- Okay.

178
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,158
- It sucks to be you.
- Yeah, it does.

179
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,828
Someone's got to go
to college, honey.
Not me.

180
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,996
Oh, shoot!
It's Mr. Pakui.

181
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,199
[Eden]
Remember how he had
pee stains all the time?

182
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,139
[Lena]
Looks like he learned
how to shake right.

183
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,404
Hi, Mr. Pakui.
Anne Marie,
This is the eighth time...

184
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,912
your sister's been tardy
in the last month.

185
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,575
I know. Traffic...
If you think surfing is
more important than school,

186
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,618
we got to make
other arrangements.

187
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:51,349
You know what, Mr. Pakui,
The only other arrangement
I can think of is my mother.

188
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:54,017
And she just so happens to be
with her latest meal ticket
in Vegas...

189
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:57,859
who apparently isn't so cool
with the kid's menu,
you know what I mean?

190
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,364
So right now,
this is the best
arrangement I can do.

191
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,299
You know,
Penny's a smart girl.
Yeah, she is.

192
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,031
Just like her sister was.

193
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:10,769
Is. Present tense.
I learned that much
while I was here.

194
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,777
You better watch it, girl.

195
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,042
I'm doing the best I can do.
That's all I can say.

196
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,583
You can do better.
All right.

197
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,819
God!

198
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:25,687
Like, he's so ripping
in that aloha shirt anyway.
I thought he was hot.

199
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,921
You did kind of peak
in seventh grade.
Shut up, Lena.

200
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:34,557
Sexually, she means.
What is this, like,
bag on Anne Marie?

201
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,624
Whoo!

202
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,966
[Beeping]

203
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,871
Seventeen fifty-three.
That's kama'aina price?

204
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,670
No kama'aina for candy.
Ohh.

205
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,505
Come on, Leilani,
it's breakfast.
Yeah.

206
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,978
Breakfast? Right.
Sorry, girls. $17.53.
This has corn syrup in it.

207
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,175
It's a vegetable.
It's nutritional.

208
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,981
No. It has sugar.
It turns into fat. And fat
comes out like me. Okay?

209
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:59,218
So, $17.53.
All right,
I've got five.

210
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,589
- How much do you have?
- I got some cash.

211
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,460
- Hold on, I got, like...
- What is this?

212
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,762
I don't know, like 70, 60...

213
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,893
That's pathetic.
What is that?

214
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,370
I didn't say I had a lot.
I said I had some.

215
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,498
[Anne Marie]
What happened to the five bucks
I gave you yesterday?

216
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,872
I bought food for Sammi.
It's not even our dog.

217
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,934
Dog's gotta eat.
So do I. I'm hungry.

218
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,742
- Eat the rest of this Twinkie.
- I don't want it.
I want breakfast.

219
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,875
- Twinkie is breakfast.
- ##[Rap]

Let's get on it.
It's gonna be a busy day.

224
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:40,529
She's with her Billabong
sponsor. Introduce yourself.
No.

225
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,760
Why not?
It's not weird.
Because it's weird.

Yes.
No.

- Hi. Can we have
your autograph?
- Yeah, sure.

228
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,098
I'll get you a pen.
Thanks.

229

Hey, I remember this shot.
[Lena]
What a life.

230
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,907
She gets a grand every time
she's in a magazine.

231
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,742
Five grand every time
she's on the cover.

232
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,406
- You surf?
- Yeah.

233
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:01,180
She gets free clothes,
boards, watches, sunglasses.

234
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,653
The girl doesn't have
to open her wallet.

235
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:06,213
[Eden]
You score one good wave
at Pipe Masters...

236
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,225
and you'll get sponsored
just like her.

237
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,261
You'll get flown
all around the world.

238
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,765
Surf Indo, Australia, Tahiti,
you name it.

239
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:17,791
Surf the world, baby.
And you'll get paid to surf
uncrowded, perfect waves.

240
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,430
We'll see you
at the contest.
Okay. Thanks a lot.

241
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:24,767
[Eden]
All you need to do
is get noticed.

242
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,243
- Surfer girls.
- Local girls.

243
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,110
You know you're
just as good as her.

What happened to all the clothes
that was on the floor?

We fold them up
and put them on the bed.

307
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:03,490
I left the clothes on the floor
so that you would know
they need to be dry-cleaned.

308
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:08,192
That's actually why
we had the dry-cleaning bags
for that specific purpose.

309
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,098
Then why don't you
put them in the bag?

That's a cute top.

00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,278
- Same thing you did.
- What?

440
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,017
Cut body
and a nice cutback.

441
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:31,251
Oh, great.
She got a bad attitude.

442
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,320
It's not who she is.

443
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:50,077
Inside.! Got it.!
I'm on it.! Get off!

444
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,949
Hey, beat it.!

445
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,487
Hey, hey, hey.!
Got it.!

446
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:06,721
Hey.!
Hey, where you been?

447
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,596
I'm on it.! Get off!

448
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:15,096
[Anne Marie]
Drew, I got it.!

449
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,170
Hey!

450
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,469
- I had the section.
What's your problem?
- You need to grow up.

451
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,700
It's not my fault you broke
your board, you stupid kook.
You're a kook.

452
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:53,210
Don't drop in on me again.
That's right, go home.
Beat it.

453
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,269
Donkey.

454
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:13,625
Can you glue it
back together?
No.

455
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:17,862
Yeah, I was
just driving by.
Okay.

456
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,099
Well, actually,
the guy at the hotel told me
where I could find you.

457
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,441
So that was pretty awesome,
you know, surfng.

458
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,444
Right.

459
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:32,916
Hey, listen.
I wanted to apologize for
my friend back at the hotel.

460
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:36,613
Leslie's kind of messy,
but when your ass is
hanging out in the pocket,

461
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,020
he's the guy you want
protecting your backside.

462
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:44,153
So next time your ass is
hanging back in the pocket,
he's your guy.

463
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,458
I'll remember that.

464
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,624
- What's up, Anne Marie?
- Hey, Ben.

465
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,033
You broke your board.
That sucks. I bet
you were charging.

466
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,537
Something like that.
Hey, don't I know you?

467
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,699
- I don't know, maybe.
- Yeah. You're that
quarterback, right?

468
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:01,074
- Yeah, I play some football.
- That's right, huh?

469
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,511
Nice shoes, bro.

470
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:10,181
Thanks.
I was wondering if, maybe,
you've taught anybody?

471
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,518
Taught anybody?
Yeah. How to surf.

472
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:16,287
No.
Well, you know,
I've got some free time.

473
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,922
That's nice.
Look, I'd...
I'd love to learn.

474
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,592
It's not easy.
I know. But it looks
really fun out there.

475
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,568
- You can get hurt.
- I'm sure I could
handle myself.

476
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:30,039
This guy Rick, he'll set
you up with a spongeboard
and some baby waves.

477
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,474
- He's gentle.
- And you are?

478
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:35,876
Not.
Right.

479
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:39,280
- Check it out.
- Who's GQ jock?

480
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,716
Ho ho ho.

481
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,612
[Horn Honks]

482
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,818
What was that all about?
I don't know. He wanted
lessons or something.

483
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:51,726
Anne Marie! Lessons?
Money? We're broke?
What?

484
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:55,323
He didn't say
anything about paying.
Well, did you ask?

485
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,836
- You guys going tonight?
No. What time?
- Go, go, go!

486
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,336
- I don't know. I'm kinda lost.
- Go get him.

487
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:06,241
Hey! Hey!
How much?
What? What?

488
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,108
- How much?
- [Honk Honking]
- I got to call you back.

489
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,943
Oh, shit!

490
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,179
Hey! Watch where you're going!

491
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:23,660
Hurry up! Go get him.
Come on.

492
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,822
- Okay, hurry, hurry, hurry.
- Hey. Hey, listen.

493
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,867
- How much?
- I don't know.
What's the going rate?

494
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,969
- Twenty bucks an hour.
- Twenty?

495
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,638
Too much?

496
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:44,147
- Fifteen?
- The hotel charges $150.

497
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,775
I'll pay that.

498
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,944
Whoa!
One hundred and fifty bucks.

499
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,011
For surf lessons?
That's it, right?

500
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,320
What else
are we talking about?
Got any friends?

501
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:58,055
- Sure I do.
- Whoo! Yeah!

502
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:02,031
##[Radio, Fading]

503
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,706
- What's with the face, Pen?
- What face?

504
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,708
Don't worry, honey.
It's just one afternoon.

505
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,301
You'll have time to get
pregnant and go on welfare.

506
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,039
Good idea.
It'll be fun.

507
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,083
- We'll play rip off the tourist.
- We're not ripping anyone off.

508
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:24,144
Anyone who pays
$1,000 a night for a room is
just begging to be ripped off.

509
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,680
[Lena] I saw those guys walk
into Tommy Bahama yesterday and
drop four G's on silk boxers.

510
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:30,192
[Anne Marie]
How is that possible?
It's underwear.

511
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,923
[Lena]
Those guys got money to burn.
They play in the NFL.

512
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,989
[Penny]
I don't care about the money.
Anything is better than this.

513
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,194
[Singing]
Oh, my God!

514
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,737
Yeah, right.
[Penny]
Let me out here, you guys.

515
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,796
Penny!
Who unloaded the mothership?

516
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,865
I thought his friends
would be hot at least.

517
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:47,206
[Penny]
This is so embarrassing
to be seen with you.

518
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,145
You gonna teach us how to surf?
You gonna teach us how to surf?

519
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,341
Guys.

520
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,509
Busted.

521
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:57,418
- Come on, it's 150 each.
- [Penny] What if we see
people we know? God.

522
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,513
Whatever.
It's surf lessons.
This is what jocks look like?

523
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,423
- A hundred and fifty bucks.
- Let's go surfing, big daddy.

524
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,893
What's up, girls?

525
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,301
This is Lena and Eden.
I'm Anne Marie.

526
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,065
- Hey.
- We gonna surf today?

527
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,402
Watch out.
I'll make sure
you drown out there.

528
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,500
How's it going? Matt.
Nice to meet you.

529
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:22,705
- This is my
little sister, Penny.
- What's up, little mama?

530
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,807
Little surf baby.
You're gonna surf in that?

531
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:30,786
- Hell, no. I'm gonna surf
in my da-da-da-da's.
- In your what?

532
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:34,484
My da-da-da-da's!

533
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,051
- Da-da-da-da!
- [Laughing]

534
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,393
You're wearing
nut huggers.

535
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:43,797
Some might call them that.
I call them nut containers.
You're gonna teach me to surf.

536
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,393
One, two, three.

537
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,404
Snap up!

538
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:55,001
- No duck butt.
- Oh. Oh, yeah.

# Somebody tell me

Yeah, totally.

Let's go out and catch
one of those big ones.

Well, sure you can handle it?
- Yeah. Definitely.

Don't worry about me.
I got this mastered.

584
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:24,393
I am a football player.
Oh, shit.!

585
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:27,022
Ohh!

586
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,760
A couple more, you've got it.
Just a couple more waves.

587
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:43,510
Dig.! Turtle.!
Get under your board.!
Turn it over.!

588
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:53,953
- [Gasping]
- Don't give up.
Come on. Paddle.

589
00:39:56,527 --> 00:40:00,019
Got to make it over this wave.
Here we go. Paddle, paddle.
Hey! Hey!

590
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:01,997
Get out of the way.!
Harder!
There you go.

591
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,103
You okay?
Oh, man,
that was intense.

592
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,666
It's getting big out here.
Sure you don't want to go in?

593
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,338
No. I mean,
are we safe out here?

594
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:20,077
That depends what you think
is safe, but, yeah, pretty much.
Oh, man.

595
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,748
[Matt]
How about this one here?
No, this one's not a wave.

596
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:31,727
Oh, almost.
We'll get you one, Matt,
I promise. Come on back.

597
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:35,061
Oh, man.
Just be patient, Matt.
We'll get you one.

598
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:38,624
Anne Marie,
we're leaving!

599
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:43,264
Hey, sweetie,
why don't you come over here
and help me out a little bit?

600
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,706
Gonna need two of us
to carry this thing.

601
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,677
We should go. It's getting late.
I'm not leaving
until I catch one.

602
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,340
- How about this one?
- Turn around, quick. Quick.
Eggbeat. Eggbeat.

603
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,444
There you go, Matt.
This is it.

604
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,546
Paddling. Start paddling.
Go! Paddle! Paddle!

605
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,690
Stand up. Stand up.

606
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,328
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo! Yeah! Yeah!

607
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,867
There you go.! Yeah.!

608
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,170
- Whoo.!
- Yeah!

609
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,913
- Yes!
- There you go.!
Goodjob, Matt.!

610
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,916
- [Yelling]
- Yeah.

611
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,418
- Good job.
- Yes!

612
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,554
Hi. Welcome to the Lanakai.
That's all right.
I'm just dropping him off.

613
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:39,494
Why don't you come in
for a drink?
[Laughs]

614
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:43,897
Um, yeah. No, I'd
love to, but l, um...
But what?

615
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,768
I have to get back
to my side of the island.
You know what I mean?

616
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,434
Uh, no. Why?
'Cause I'm in training.

617
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,911
Pipe, uh, line.
Pipeline.

618
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,244
Master. Pipe Masters.
Right.
Pipe Masters. Right.

619
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:03,648
[Sighs]
Well, uh,
I tell you what. Uh...

620
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,816
I've only got 40 bucks.
For what?

621
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:10,327
For you.
For the lesson.

622
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,589
Oh, right.
But if you want
to come up to my room,

623
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:15,655
I'll give you the rest of it,
the money.

624
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:22,405
l-I would
really like to do that,
but see those guys over there?

625
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,997
They see us
heading up to your room,

626
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:26,668
half the island's gonna have us
sleeping together by tomorrow.

627
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,678
Really?
It's the coconut wireless.

628
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:31,237
That's very serious.
It's great. Yeah.

629
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:34,842
In that case, you wait here,
I'll come right back
with your money.

630
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:36,910
All right. Well, wait.

631
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,488
I'll come up.
You sure?

632
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,051
Okay. I don't want to ruin
your reputation or anything.

633
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:47,188
Thanks.
I'll worry about that.

634
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:51,132
All right.
Okay. You go up the elevator,
I'll go up the back way.

635
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:55,035
It's so sneaky.
It's likeJames Bond.
Just shut up.

636
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,347
Excuse me.

637
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,064
# I lie awake #

638
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,073
# I've gone to ground #

639
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:34,474
# I'm watching porn #

640
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:38,413
# In my hotel dressing gown #

641
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:41,713
- [Sighs]
- # Now I dream of you #

642
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,310
- What the hell is she doing?
- # But I still believe #

643
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:47,721
- Hey. Where you going?
- Hey.

644
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:51,090
I just... I didn't...
I didn't know if that
was your room or not.

645
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:53,493
It's my room.
Yeah.
[Chuckles]

646
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,555
Come in.
Okay. Thanks.

647
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,193
[Clears Throat]

648
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:01,237
# And it feels so bad #
Oh.

649
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:05,469
- Looks different at night.
- Yeah. It's pretty nice.

650
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,978
I'm gonna...
I'm just gonna go...
Yeah. It's right there.

651
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,141
Yeah, I know where it is.
Thanks.

652
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:21,581
# I'm nearly with you #

653
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:26,722
# When I'm weak
I draw strength from you #

654
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:29,425
# And when you're lost #

655
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,096
# I know how
to change your mood #

656
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,105
# And when I'm down #

657
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:41,509
# You breathe life over me #

658
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:43,512
What are you doing?

659
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,778
Uh, I'm just trying to
find the money that I hid.

660
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,445
- What, from the maid?
- Yeah, right.

661
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:54,017
Uh, let's see.

662
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:57,925
- One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine...
- Whoa, wait.

663
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:02,591
That's... That's way,
way just...
That's... That's a $1,000.

664
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,499
I'll be here a week.
That's $150 a day.

665
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:10,165
So I gave myself a $50 discount
for paying up front.

666
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,674
Are you trying
to buy me?
No.

667
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:15,769
No. I just don't
want to lose you.

668

# When I'm weak #

#I know how to change
your mood #

672
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,492
Can I ask you
a really weird question?
[Chuckles]

673
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,431
Yeah.
Are you wearing my cologne?

674
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,128
Yes. Uh-huh.

675
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,606
It, uh,
it smells good on you.

676
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:46,643
[Phone Ringing]

677
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:50,880
[Ringing]

678
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:54,349
You should
probably get that.
Yeah. Right.

679
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,946
Hey, you.
[Ringing]

680
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:02,685
Yeah?
Hey. Hey, sweetheart.

681
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,320
Are you feeling better?
Yeah, I know.

682
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:08,125
I tried to call earlier,
but, uh, no one was there.

683
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:11,497
Yeah, I miss you too.
I miss you too.

684
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,729
It's been hectic.
Matt, I'm gonna...

685
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:18,166
Listen, let me call you back,
all right? All right.

686
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:23,146
I love you too.
All right, bye-bye.
[Hangs Up Phone]

687
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:28,241
- Sorry.
- Guess that's why they have
that no fraternization rule.

688
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:30,513
What do you mean?

689
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:32,555
Management gets
call from irate wife...

690
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,558
wondering why maid
is in husband's room
at 2:00 in the morning.

691
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,392
That's not my wife.
Wife, girlfriend, boyfriend.

692
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,829
No, really.
It's not my wife.
Look, it's my niece.

693
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:46,199
Actually, my...
my sister's daughter, Rebecca.
There she is.

694
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,505
So.

695
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:51,564
I swear.

696
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,101
She's beautiful.
Yeah, she is.
She's a sweetheart.

697
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:00,378
Sorry about that.
It's just, uh, kinda strange
with the time difference.

698
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,782
I should probably go.
It's getting late.

699
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:06,118
All right. Do we have
a surf lesson tomorrow?

700
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:09,057
Definitely.
All right.

701
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:11,253
Okay.

702
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:15,463
Bye.
Bye.

703
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:18,091
Bye.

704
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:47,393
I thought you were
just giving him lessons.

705
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:49,455
I did.
Huh. Yeah, in what?

706
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,501
Penny didn't finish
her homework.

707
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:54,469
- You weren't here to help me.
- She's got to do her homework.

708
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,597
Don't give us shit 'cause
you were out there working it.

709
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:59,301
Shut up.
Don't deny it.

710
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:04,905
You were working it
like a rib without sauce.
Shut up... Ow!

711
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:07,314
Well, what happened?
Oh, my God. Nothing.

712
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,579
Oh, sure.
Tell me what happened.

713
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,814
No.
Did you get some play? Huh?

714
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:15,620
- Did you? Did you?
- We kissed for two seconds.
It wasn't a big deal.

715
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:18,286
I'm sure you did.
How much am I supposed
to buy that for?

716
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:20,626
What do you take me for?
I don't know.

717
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:22,995
Seriously.
What else? Come on.

718
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,057
Here, this will
pay the bills.

719
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,366
There's, like, $1,000 here.
I feel like your pimp.

720
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:33,205
You must know how to kiss.
Or you must know how to
do something else.

721
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:36,178
Good night, Penny.
You're going to bed now.

722
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:43,442
Hey.
What's up?

723
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:52,558
Look, I hate
to be the buzzkill here,
but the contest is in a week.

724
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:55,120
And I just don't think
that it's time for...

725
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:58,827
I know.
But I did promise him
another lesson tomorrow.

726
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:03,337
- Can't you just
blow him off?
- No.

727
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,637
- Why not?
- Because he already paid me.

728
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:08,303
Exactly.
Eden.

729
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,907
I wanted to rent

- A little spot the hotel does
not tell the tourists about.

Because I'm scared

See how I can't
extend my finger?
Yes.

758
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:07,353
Because my sister Dana
broke it when I was eight...

759
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:09,331
just because I wouldn't
get out of her room.

760
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,264
Because it's broken that way,

when I throw the football,
it gives it a nice little zip.

[Announcer]
Looks like she's
goin'on this one.

1166
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:45,486
[Excited Chatter]
[Announcer Continues,
Indistinct]

1167
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,585
Hey. Hey, Anne Marie.
Look what I found.

1168
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:51,599
[Announcer]
Next heat, Keala Kennelly.
Hey. Just driving by.

1169
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,635
What's up,
surfer girl?

1170
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:56,136
- Do the damn thing.
- [Both Laughing]

1171
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:59,640
- Shit.
- [Announcer]
Twenty-foot swell on the rise.

1172
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:03,302
[Anne Marie]
Pretty weird out there.

1173
01:18:03,378 --> 01:18:07,678
It's a super-clean,
west-northwest swell.

1174
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:10,843
Pipe and back door
are both open.

1175
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:13,820
[Lena]
Yeah. Just be patient.
Don't get too anxious.

1176
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:17,825
It's four-wave sets
with 20-second intervals.
Take your time.

1177
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:20,657
[Penny]
Don't take the first wave
of the set.

1178
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:22,492
Third wave
looks the best.

1179
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:26,432
[Announcer]
Here comes Kennelly
taking off. Steep drop.

1180
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:29,026
She makes the bottom turn.
She's fierce, man.

1181
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:31,504
Gets covered up.

1182
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:35,707
Oh.! She makes it out.

1183
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:38,940
Let's give her a warm
round of applause.
I'm way out of my league.

1184
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:41,847
Hey. No worries.

1185
01:18:41,917 --> 01:18:45,978
Just go out there
and have fun.
[Laughs] "Fun."

1186
01:18:49,357 --> 01:18:53,123
[Announcer] Up next,
from Australia, we have
Kate Skarratt in red.

1187
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:56,164
[Sighs]
She's a goofy foot, which
favors her at Pipeline.

1188
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:59,462
Loves charging big waves
and has taken first place
at Teahupoo,

1189
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:02,094
another barreling
left-hander in Tahiti.

1190
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:05,606
Surfng against her,
we have wild card entry,
Anne Marie Chadwick,

1191
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:09,440
a formerJunior NSSA champion
who dropped out of
the competitive circuit...

1192
01:19:09,511 --> 01:19:14,471
after a near-drowning incident
at this very spot
just three years ago.

1193
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:19,043
Five, four, three,
two, one.

1194
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:21,112
[Air Horn Blasts]

1195
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:48,348
[Chattering]

1196
01:19:49,818 --> 01:19:52,309
[Panting]

1197
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:58,454
We've got 20-minute heats
today with the top
four waves scoring.

1198
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:01,052
Wave selection is critical.

1199
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:03,962
If you pick the wrong wave,
wipe out, get caught inside...

1200
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:08,196
You could spend the rest
of your heatjust trying
to get back to the lineup.

1201
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:10,261
How's it goin'?
Good.

1202
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:13,705
Nice set approaching.
Got good sets out the back.

1203
01:20:13,775 --> 01:20:17,176
We have really good
consistency with swell.
It's on the rise.

1204
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:19,645
Probably gonna get up
to about 15 to 20 feet.

1205
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:23,707
Kate Skarratt's goin'
on this one. She's paddling,
gets to her feet.

1206
01:20:23,785 --> 01:20:26,777
Makes the drop.
Solid bottom turn.

1207
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:31,216
[Clicking]
Look at that pit.!

1208
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:34,694
She's setting her line,
racing to make it out.

1209
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:37,254
Trying to get
to the shoulder.

1210
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:42,065
Traveling...
Oh.! She didn't quite
get around that last turn.

1211
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:46,504
She'll get some kind
of score for it.

1212
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:50,511
Looks like it's a 4. 1
that came in on the board.

1213
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:53,514
Water patrol's
checking on her.
Looks like she's okay.

1214
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:57,143
If she doesn't need a ride,
she can paddle back out.

1215
01:20:57,219 --> 01:21:01,656
So Chadwick all alone
by herself out there,
yet to even score a ride.

1216
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:06,323
Go, go! Paddle!
Headed for her first ride.

1217
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:10,324
[Announcer Continues,
Indistinct]

1218
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:16,361
[Announcer]
Backs out.
Shit!

1219
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:24,043
- Beautiful wave. She's not
gonna get any more like that.
- What a waste of wave.

1220
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:26,444
She should've gone.
That would have opened up
perfectly.

1221
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:28,505
Shit!

1222
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:33,020
When you're out there all alone,
you can psyche yourself out.
You can do it, girl.

1223
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:35,181
- Chadwick will have to wait
for the next set.
- What are you doin'?

1224
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:38,385
Kate Skarratt's paddling
into one of the best
waves of the day.

1225
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:41,861
0h.! Look at this wave.
It is a bomb.

1226
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:46,629
Oh.!
She's a little overextended
and goes down.

1227
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,240
[Gasps]

1228
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:06,715
- Hope she's okay out there.
Kate Skarratt down.
- Ooh.

1229
01:22:06,788 --> 01:22:10,690
[Announcer Continues,
Indistinct]

1230
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:14,388
Great pickup.
Gets her on the sled,
out ofharm's way.

1231
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:16,453
Hang on.

1232
01:22:18,466 --> 01:22:22,664
Okay, everybody, as the ski
comes up on the beach,
please give them some room.

1233
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:24,728
The water patrol
needs some space to work.

1234
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:28,333
Skate Skarratt has gone
down on that last wave.

1235
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:30,640
They're carrying
the backboard down.
This isn't good.

1236
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:33,408
We need Dr. Leland Dao
to report to the medical tent.

1237
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:35,574
Leland Dao, please report
to the medical tent.

1238
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:38,210
We need you down here
immediately.

1239
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:40,311
[Sighs]

1240
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:43,853
Come on. Come on.

1241
01:22:50,365 --> 01:22:52,765
Charge it!

1242
01:22:54,836 --> 01:22:57,737
Go, go, go!
Go! Go!

1243
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:00,331
Go! Go!
Go!

1244
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:09,775
[Announcer]
She sets her rail.

1245
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:12,319
Makes the drop.
Textbook. Oh.!

1246
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:14,378
It's setting up perfectly.

1247
01:23:14,456 --> 01:23:17,323
Look at that.
Beautiful wave.

1248
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:23,828
She should get
a nice score for this one,
Yes!

1249
01:23:23,898 --> 01:23:26,264
high enough to take her
into the next round.

1250
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:40,138
- [Announcer]
Oh.!
- [All Groan]

1251
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:48,485
- Oh, she got so worked.
- [People Groaning]

1252
01:24:24,759 --> 01:24:27,353
[Crying]

1253
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:29,795
[Announcer, Indistinct]
[Woman] I don't see her.
Where is she?

1254
01:24:29,864 --> 01:24:32,992
Man, is she all right?
Where is she?

1255
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:54,053
[Gasping]

1256
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:02,556
Oh!

1257
01:25:31,826 --> 01:25:34,624
[Announcer]
Anne Marie's taking
a heavy beating out there.

1258
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:42,932
[Gasping]

1259
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:46,940
[Coughs]

1260
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:48,942
Grab my hand.

1261
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:53,103
I got you.
Hang on.

1262
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:03,179
[Announcer] Not that she cares
right now, but thejudges'
scores havejust come in...

1263
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:05,726
and they've awarded her a 4.6
for the last ride,

1264
01:26:05,793 --> 01:26:09,456
which will move her
into the next round
over Skarratt.

1265
01:26:10,732 --> 01:26:12,962
- Anne Marie!
- Are you okay?

1266

[Announcer Continues,

[Overlapping Voices]

1267
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:17,905
- [Lena]
Is she gonna be all right?
- Is she gonna be all right?

1268
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:20,736
She'll be okay.
Just give her some room.
[Coughing]

1269
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:23,072
Is she
gonna be okay?

1270
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:25,169
I think so.

1271

[Announcer Continues,

[Neck Cracks]

1272
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:33,744
I'm gonna put
some ice on it.

1273
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:35,812
Lift your head.

1274
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,951
Just lay there
and relax for a minute.

1275
01:26:46,267 --> 01:26:48,258
Hey.

1276
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:51,828
If you tell me to be the girl
on the beach right now,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1277
01:26:51,906 --> 01:26:54,136
[Laughing]
Oh.

1278
01:26:56,177 --> 01:26:59,044
So how are you feelin'?
I've been better.

1279
01:26:59,113 --> 01:27:01,980
Yeah.

1280
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:06,145
My, uh,
my first NFL game,

1281
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,486
I got blindsided
by Warren Sapp.

1282
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:12,048
I tell you,
I've never been hit
so hard in my life.

1283
01:27:12,126 --> 01:27:16,495
I lay there praying something
was broken so I wouldn't have
to get up and finish the game.

1284
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:21,160
You think I'm faking?
No. I know
you got rocked out there.

1285
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:24,637
Just like I did.
But Leslie sat me down,

1286
01:27:24,706 --> 01:27:29,439
said that was the hardest
I'd ever be hit and that I would
regret not going back in.

1287
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:32,308
So l... I went back in.

1288
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,814
And you won the game.

1289
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:37,248
No. Actually, we lost.

1290
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:41,550
[Laughing]
And I got my ass kicked.

1291
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:46,757
But there's this one
beautiful pass...

1292
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:51,231
one perfect spiral
right into Omar's fingertips...

1293
01:27:51,299 --> 01:27:53,358
and a touchdown.

1294
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:59,364
[Sighs]
Look, I can't talk you
into goin'back out there.

1295
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,738
It's... It seems crazy.

1296
01:28:04,078 --> 01:28:09,038
But I know how good you are,
and I know how much
this means to you.

1297
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:13,213
I just don't want you
to spend your life wondering
what could have been.

1298
01:28:20,828 --> 01:28:23,524
[Announcer]
Heads up on the beach, people.
Big set approaching.

1299
01:28:23,598 --> 01:28:26,192
Hey, everybody, we have
a set out the back.

1300
01:28:26,267 --> 01:28:28,701
Watch your kids.
Watch your belongings.

1301
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:31,864
The water is coming
over the berm.
It's dangerous out there.

1302
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:34,703
The water patrol already
has their hands full,

1303
01:28:34,776 --> 01:28:37,244
so we'd appreciate it
if you'djust back up.

1304
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:40,110
Here today we have
a rising swell,

1305
01:28:40,181 --> 01:28:43,241
so I wanna give
a little word of warning
to everybody to watch out.

1306
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:46,253
Guys, look, this is really
not a good time.
Can I get a picture?

1307
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,755
What?
Can we get a picture?
We're working these chicks here.

1308
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:51,291
They think you're some kind
of great hockey player
or something.

1309
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:55,955
You're kidding.
No joke. We wanna
get this thing done.

1310
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:59,557
Sorry my pits stink.
That's just the way it goes.
Let's go. Right here.

1311
01:28:59,634 --> 01:29:01,829
Smile.
You're on vacation.
This way, this way.

1312
01:29:01,903 --> 01:29:04,235
Fluff your bangs
a little bit.
A little more attitude.

1313
01:29:04,305 --> 01:29:07,069
Beautiful.
One more.
All right, great.

1314
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:09,132
Hey.
Hey.

1315
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:11,508
You goin'
back out there?
Yup.

1316
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:13,774
It's just a stupid contest.
It's not worth
getting hurt over.

1317
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:15,839
I'll be fine.
Hey.

1318
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:19,751
- What?
- Be careful.

1319
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:22,483
[Laughing]
Yeah.

1320
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:26,255
- [Blasts]
- [Announcer] That sounds
the start of the next heat.

1321
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:29,421
Chadwick's pretty much
got her hands full
this next round.

1322
01:29:29,497 --> 01:29:31,988
Keala Kennelly from Hawaii.
She's a charger.

1323
01:29:32,066 --> 01:29:35,058
She'll go on anything.
She goes like a man out here.

1324
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:43,708
Bit of a paddle battle
going on out there.

1325
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:47,305
Looks like Chadwick
and Kennelly are
paddling for the peak.

1326
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:49,441
Chadwick's got
the inside position.

1327
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:52,008
- Lf a big set approaches,
she's gonna get the first wave.
- Come on, come on.

1328
01:29:52,086 --> 01:29:54,554
This paddle battle
is really about who's
gonna get the first wave.

1329
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:57,386
Chadwick in position,
heading for the first wave.

1330
01:29:57,458 --> 01:29:59,449
Starts to paddle.
She's goin'for it.

1331
01:30:01,462 --> 01:30:06,058
Oh.! She... She pulls back.
Kennelly's wide open.
She catches a wave.

1332
01:30:07,135 --> 01:30:08,329
[Sighs]

1333
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:13,563
Time and time again,
man.

1334
01:30:31,392 --> 01:30:34,225
She's out,
making it look so easy.

1335
01:30:34,295 --> 01:30:36,991
But, folks,
it's not easy out there.

1336
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:41,091
Chadwick starts to paddle.
She paddles for it.

1337
01:30:41,169 --> 01:30:43,160
Doesn't quite get it.

1338
01:30:45,673 --> 01:30:47,607
[All Groan]
What a waste of wave.

1339
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:55,445
[Announcer]
That's gotta hurt when
you know you need a score,

1340
01:30:55,516 --> 01:30:58,679
and you're going up against
one of the best surfers
in this event,

1341
01:30:58,753 --> 01:31:01,119
and you don't go.

1342
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:04,181
Plenty of time being
allowed here for Kennelly
to get back in position,

1343
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:06,886
and she's paddled
right inside of Chadwick,

1344
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:08,952
and she's looking
to catch her next wave.

1345
01:31:30,184 --> 01:31:32,812
Keala Kennelly.
Hands together,
ladies and gentlemen.

1346
01:31:32,887 --> 01:31:35,651
Keala Kennelly.
A great two-ride out here
at the Pipeline.

1347
01:31:35,723 --> 01:31:39,921
[Crowd Cheering]
Keala's got sack.
She goes like the men out here.

1348
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:43,259
For some reason, Chadwick
has yet to even ride a wave.
I don't know what's going on.

1349
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:46,892
I don't know if she's just
psyching herself out or if
Keala's putting it to her.

1350
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:55,773
What are you doin'?
What?

1351
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:57,674
You gonna take a wave
or just sit there
like a buoy?

1352
01:31:57,745 --> 01:32:01,943
Look, you're never gonna
catch a wave sitting
all the way over here.

1353
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:06,646
Follow me. I'll get you
into one. Give the crowd
something to cheer about.

1354
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:08,746
Let's get you a wave.
Come on.

1355
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:14,621
Follow me into the lineup,
and I'm gonna tell you
to go on a wave.

1356
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:16,754
And when I tell you to go,
you gotta go.

1357
01:32:16,831 --> 01:32:19,959
Paddle your little heart out.
You can't hesitate.
You can't pull back.

1358
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:22,332
You can't hold back.
No fear, all right?

1359
01:32:22,403 --> 01:32:25,497
'Cause if you hold back
for a second,
you're gonna eat shit.

1360
01:32:25,573 --> 01:32:27,564
Come on. Follow me.

1361
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:35,671
[Announcer]
It looks like the next set's
approaching.

1362
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:38,947
This is the one. Go.

1363
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:42,114
Paddle! Paddle!
Go, girl!
Paddle! Paddle!

1364
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:44,714
Paddle.!

1365
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:46,692
Ah!

1366
01:32:46,761 --> 01:32:48,752
Go.!

1367
01:32:51,866 --> 01:32:53,458
Oh!

1368
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:06,240
[Crowd Groans]

1369
01:33:31,739 --> 01:33:35,106
[Man]
You all right?
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1370
01:33:35,176 --> 01:33:37,508
Get back out there then.

1371
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:44,842
- [Blasts]
- [Announcer] With only
two minutes left in her heat,

1372
01:33:44,919 --> 01:33:46,944
Chadwick struggles
to get back into the lineup...

1373
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:49,854
so she can catch
a scoring wave.

1374
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:52,893
Chadwick has yet to even
score a good ride,
a scoring ride.

1375
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:57,021
She needs to redeem herself.
Keala is absolutely
dominating this heat,

1376
01:33:57,098 --> 01:33:59,293
and Chadwick needs to put
a scoring ride on the board.

1377
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:09,006
[Gasping]

1378
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:14,046
Ouch.
Are you all right?

1379
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:16,583
That was nasty.
It's okay.
I want another one.

1380
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:18,949
- You want another one?
That's the spirit.
- Yup.

1381
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:20,749
Shake off that last wave,
and let's do this.

1382
01:34:20,821 --> 01:34:23,619
Less than 20 seconds left.
Feel that adrenaline.
Use it. Come on.

1383
01:34:23,691 --> 01:34:26,421
Anne Marie Chadwick
only has one more chance.

1384
01:34:28,629 --> 01:34:32,258
On the outside. Here comes
one of the best sets
of the whole day.

1385
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:34,995
We have lines
stacked to the horizon.

1386

Here comes a set.
This is the one.

- Waiting for

1403
01:36:30,184 --> 01:36:34,120
They're coming in.
Looks like unanimous tens
across the board,

1404
01:36:34,188 --> 01:36:36,884
but not enough
to overtake Kennelly
and move into the next round.

1405
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:42,486
- But she is a hero
with the crowd here today.
- That's my sister! Whoo!

01:36:42,563 --> 01:36:44,190
That's my sister!

Just words
don't explain it.

1408
01:36:46,367 --> 01:36:49,530
For Anne Marie Chadwick
to get a ride like that...

1409
01:36:49,603 --> 01:36:52,800
with the entire North Shore
surfng community watching...
[All Whooping]

# Runnin'with the summer

1456
01:39:28,095 --> 01:39:30,859
# Sunny beach, pumpin'Bananarama
The bangingest bodies
have bikinis on #

1457
01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:33,331
# I'm grabbin' 'em,
unravelin' the straps when I
bring her back to the cabin #

1458
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:35,163
# Summer sucks without
this, that and those #

1459
01:39:35,235 --> 01:39:39,035
# It's a cruel, cruel summer #
# It's a cruel #

1460
01:39:41,342 --> 01:39:43,810
# Leavin' me here
on my own #

1461

# It's a cruel, cruel summer #
# It's a cruel #

# Now you've gone #

1463
01:39:54,021 --> 01:39:58,321
# So tell me to ease out
Better to move or doubt #

# Which one you'll play about
Find a chick to get out #

1465
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:05,029
# So I'm walkin'
across the street
to the public pools #

1466
01:40:05,099 --> 01:40:08,660
# When I spot this lovely jewel
A sweet cutie, never met her
but yet she knew me #

1467
01:40:08,736 --> 01:40:10,670
# She said #
# Ain't you that kid
from that rap group #

1468
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:14,071
# Please, darlin', may I have
the honors of remaining
anonymous for the time bein' #

1469
01:40:14,141 --> 01:40:15,472
# Later, I'll bust a rhyme
for you #

1470
01:40:15,542 --> 01:40:17,203
# What's the matter
Havin'a bad day #

1471
01:40:17,277 --> 01:40:20,178
# She looked at me with sad face
and began to say to me #

1472
01:40:20,247 --> 01:40:24,081
# Hot summer streets and
the pavements are burnin' #

1473
01:40:24,151 --> 01:40:27,314
# I sit around #
# I said, you gotta
be kiddin', baby #

1474
01:40:27,388 --> 01:40:28,912
# Summer is the joint
What you thinkin' #

1475
01:40:28,989 --> 01:40:33,756
# Tryin'to smile
but the air
is so heavy and dry #

1476
01:40:33,827 --> 01:40:38,321
# Aw, sweetie, don't be sad
Possibly where you are
It'll ease that #

1477
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:42,495
# Strange voices are sayin'
Uh, what did they say #

1478
01:40:42,569 --> 01:40:45,766
# Shh #
# Things I can't understand #

1479
01:40:45,839 --> 01:40:48,273
# Uh-uh #
# It's too close for comfort #

1480
01:40:48,342 --> 01:40:51,209
# This heat has got
right out ofhand #

1481
01:40:51,278 --> 01:40:53,746
# So I grabbed her by the hand
dragged her to the pool #

1482
01:40:53,814 --> 01:40:55,372
# Splashed her in
and that's it #
