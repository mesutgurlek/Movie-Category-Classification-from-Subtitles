1
00:01:59,394 --> 00:02:00,520
Good morning.

2
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:02,127
Good morning.

3
00:03:14,635 --> 00:03:16,068
Wave those flags, son!

4
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,532
Get out of there!

5
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:19,472
Hit them again!

6
00:03:19,674 --> 00:03:20,766
Get out of here!

7
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:23,375
Get out of them trees, damn it!

8
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:26,305
Get them!

9
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:27,811
Migrate south, will you?

10
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,071
Mama!

11
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,639
Mama!

12
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:35,778
-Three more radios for you, Shelby.
-Not now, Tommy. Mama!

13
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,220
This nail polish is drying
way too dark.

14
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:42,522
''Practically Pink,'' my foot. Looks like
a stuck pig bled all over my hand.

15
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,789
l'm sure l have something
that will do.

16
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:46,864
Oh, no!

17
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:49,033
lt has to be delicate.

18
00:03:49,237 --> 00:03:53,936
lf l don't have something, your brother
will go get some ''delicate'' pink polish.

19
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:55,666
-Mom--
-Jonathan, just a minute.

20
00:03:55,877 --> 00:03:58,675
Great. l'd love to see
what the boys would pick out.

21
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:02,571
Delivery man! Someone stop
that truck! Stop that--

22
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:05,950
Don't put ice down my back!

23
00:04:06,154 --> 00:04:07,917
You should've drowned them at birth.

24
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,282
Shelby.

25
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,191
-See if you can get this.
-My nails are wet.

26
00:04:12,393 --> 00:04:13,519
Shelby!

27
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:16,227
Ma'am?

28
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,489
Would you look at those, please?

29
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:21,259
Dad, over here! Behind the tent!
Come on!

30
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,993
Myrtle, hi.

31
00:04:24,338 --> 00:04:25,703
Hold on, please.

32
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:26,999
l'm gonna get you!

33
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:29,439
Drum!

34
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,135
Sweetheart, l'm on the phone.

35
00:04:33,047 --> 00:04:36,312
Stop that now!
l can't hear myself think!

36
00:04:36,784 --> 00:04:39,719
Myrtle, the champagne glasses,
they're all broken.

37
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:40,910
Help!

38
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:53,088
Spud!

39
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:07,673
Spud, turn off that stupid television.

40
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,379
Get in here and finish dyeing
these Easter eggs.

41
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:12,848
l ran out of stuff.

42
00:05:13,054 --> 00:05:15,522
Well, that's why God
invented the A&P.

43
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:18,920
-Gotta work on the truck.
-No, you gotta get the lead out.

44
00:05:19,126 --> 00:05:21,424
Yes, ma'am. l live to serve.

45
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:25,156
lf those eggs are not at the church
by noon, they don't get hidden.

46
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:29,126
Are you listening to me, Spud?

47
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,200
Mrs. Jones?

48
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:35,572
Are you Annelle?

49
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:38,074
You sweet thing, come on.

50
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,607
Excuse me.

51
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,441
Pick up my green dress
at the cleaners!

52
00:05:44,318 --> 00:05:46,309
Am l interrupting something?

53
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,355
No, l'm just screaming at my
husband. l can do that anytime.

54
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:54,056
Please, call me Truvy.

55
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:55,753
Thank you.

56
00:05:56,764 --> 00:05:59,562
Mama, look at this.
This was in the hall closet.

57
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,098
What is it?

58
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,896
Rubbers.

59
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:07,038
Tommy says Jonathan's planning to cover
the honeymoon car with these.

60
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:10,637
-Please stop him!
-Keep your voice down.

61
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:11,903
Jonathan!

62
00:06:12,146 --> 00:06:14,011
Boys, l wanna talk to you.

63
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:16,274
Tommy! Jonathan! Tommy!

64
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:20,644
Jonathan, don't you decorate
your sister's car with condoms!

65
00:06:20,855 --> 00:06:22,186
lt's tacky!

66
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,893
lt's like talking to a brick wall.

67
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:29,585
lf he's trying to drive me crazy,
it's too late.

68
00:06:29,797 --> 00:06:32,493
There must be a better way
to get rid of those birds.

69
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,463
We could cut down all our trees...

70
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:38,435
...or change the migratory patterns
of the birds. Take your pick.

71
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,698
You told him to get rid of them.

72
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:44,400
l had no idea he would alienate
the entire neighborhood.

73
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,307
lt'd be a lot more alienated...

74
00:06:46,514 --> 00:06:49,142
...if they got covered
in bird shit at my reception.

75
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,317
Pretty talk!

76
00:06:51,152 --> 00:06:53,382
Do you have to be so crude?

77
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:05,988
There.

78
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:08,963
l see a hole.

79
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,967
l was hoping you'd catch that.

80
00:07:12,106 --> 00:07:16,440
lt's a little bit pouffier than l
would normally do, but l'm nervous.

81
00:07:16,877 --> 00:07:18,208
l'm not worried about that.

82
00:07:18,412 --> 00:07:21,904
l usually wrap my entire head
in toilet paper when l go to bed...

83
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:25,711
...so it usually gets pretty shmushed
down in that process anyway.

84
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,789
At the trade school, l was number one
when it came to frosting and streaking.

85
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,516
l did my own.

86
00:07:32,727 --> 00:07:33,716
Really?

87
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:35,285
That's good.

88
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:39,432
And l can usually spot a bottle job
at 20 paces.

89
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:42,758
-Your technique is really good.
-Thanks.

90
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,770
l think your form and content
will improve with time.

91
00:07:46,974 --> 00:07:51,343
So, best l can tell, young lady,
you've just landed yourself a job.

92
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:52,807
Oh, God!

93
00:07:53,447 --> 00:07:54,436
Thank you!

94
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:55,979
Thank you, Miss Truvy.

95
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:59,846
No time for thanks. We'll be busier
than a one-armed paperhanger.

96
00:08:00,054 --> 00:08:01,282
Here, let me help you.

97
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:02,786
lt's all right. l got it.

98
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,550
You got tiny little hairs
and fuzzies all over you.

99
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,126
There's so much static electricity
in this room...

100
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:11,025
...l pick up everything
but boys and money.

101
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:16,425
Louie!

102
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,361
Louie, hold up!

103
00:08:18,572 --> 00:08:19,937
l want you to meet Annelle.

104
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:22,866
She's taking Judy's place.

105
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,366
Swell.

106
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:27,780
Louie, take out the garbage!

107
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:29,271
Can't.

108
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,706
Late.

109
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:34,254
What'd you hire her for?

110
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,987
Our son.

111
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,490
We're so proud of him.

112
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,726
Annelle, honey, what do you say
we talk some trash?

113
00:08:48,602 --> 00:08:51,366
l'm so excited.
l can't believe it's happening.

114
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,631
l'm a beautician!

115
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:56,035
''Glamour technician.''

116
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:57,938
Glamour technician.

117
00:08:58,145 --> 00:09:01,478
l'll have you know, you are
working in the most successful shop...

118
00:09:01,682 --> 00:09:03,013
...in this town.

119
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:07,278
Because l have a strict philosophy
that l have stuck to for 1 5 years.

120
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:10,480
There is no such thing
as natural beauty.

121
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:13,225
''There is no such thing
as natural beauty.''

122
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,895
You remember that,
or we're all out of a job.

123
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,328
Just look at me. lt takes
some effort to look like this.

124
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:21,592
l can see that.

125
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:24,304
So how long have you been in town?

126
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:25,665
A few weeks.

127
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:26,965
New in town.

128
00:09:27,174 --> 00:09:29,734
lt must be exciting
being in a new place.

129
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:33,107
l wouldn't know.
l've lived here all my life.

130
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:36,343
Well, tell me things about yourself.

131
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:38,045
There's nothing to tell.

132
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:41,813
l live here. l've got a job now.
That's it.

133
00:09:42,022 --> 00:09:44,456
How about a few of these issues
of Southern Hair?.

134
00:09:44,658 --> 00:09:45,750
Sure, take them.

135
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,396
lt is essential to stay abreast
of the latest styles.

136
00:09:49,597 --> 00:09:51,929
And l'm glad to see your interest.

137
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:57,868
You must live close by. At least in
walking distance. l didn't see a car.

138
00:10:00,574 --> 00:10:02,667
l don't have a car.

139
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:06,535
l been staying across the river
at Robeline's boarding house.

140
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,710
That's quite a walk.

141
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,750
Ruth Robeline.

142
00:10:11,952 --> 00:10:13,817
Now, there is a story for you.

143
00:10:14,755 --> 00:10:16,950
She is a troubled, twisted soul.

144
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,355
Her whole life has been
an experiment in terror.

145
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,186
Her husband got killed
in World War ll.

146
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:25,797
Then her son got killed in Vietnam.

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,300
When it comes to suffering, she is
right up there with Elizabeth Taylor.

148
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:32,870
l had no idea.

149
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:36,341
Hello!

150
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:38,705
-Clairee!
-Good morning. Good morning!

151
00:10:38,913 --> 00:10:42,349
l'd like to introduce you to
the former first lady of Chinquapin...

152
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,485
-...Miss Belcher.
-l'd like you to meet Annelle.

153
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,551
l'm a little embarrassed.
l'm windblown.

154
00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:50,485
l've just been to the dedication
of the children's park.

155
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:52,490
How did that go?

156
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,785
Beautifully.

157
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:55,291
Except....

158
00:10:55,663 --> 00:10:59,292
Janice van Meter got hit
with a baseball. lt was fabulous.

159
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,432
Was she hurt?

160
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:03,262
l doubt it. She got hit in the head.

161
00:11:03,604 --> 00:11:07,005
Janice van Meter is the current
mayor's wife. We hate her.

162
00:11:07,308 --> 00:11:09,936
They named the new park
after Clairee's late husband.

163
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:12,305
This town is so proud of her.

164
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,147
That's nice.

165
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:16,975
What's your family name, dear?

166
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:20,043
My married name is Dupuy...

167
00:11:20,254 --> 00:11:22,347
...but l'm originally from Zwolle.

168
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,052
How nice.

169
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:27,785
There's towels in the dryer.
Would you fold them and bring them in?

170
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:29,929
-Sure.
-Thank you.

171
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,064
Sweet gal. Where'd you find her?

172
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:33,699
Yesterday, when Judy quit...

173
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:37,598
...l called up the trade school
and told them to send me a warm body.

174
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:41,605
And Annelle was the valedictorian
of the hairdo class.

175
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,810
And l think there's a story there.

176
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,713
What makes you say that?

177
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,711
For starters, she's married...

178
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:53,046
...but she's living over
at Ruth Robeline's alone.

179
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,779
l'd get to the bottom of this
if l were you.

180
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,117
You have some silverware
you'd like to keep.

181
00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:01,761
l'm not worried about that.
She's just as sweet as she can be.

182
00:12:02,062 --> 00:12:05,998
And besides, l kind of like the idea
of hiring somebody with a past.

183
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:10,329
She can't be more than 1 8.
She hasn't had time to have a past.

184
00:12:10,537 --> 00:12:11,731
Get with it, Clairee.

185
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:16,399
This is the '80s. lf you can achieve
puberty, you can achieve a past.

186
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:19,735
That man!

187
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:23,314
l swear, l don't know how M'Lynn
puts up with that.

188
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,249
Go on, get out of here!

189
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:03,119
Jackson, please.

190
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,224
l'm gonna talk some sense into you.

191
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:08,452
lt's bad luck to see me
before the wedding.

192
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,926
So you are gonna marry me.

193
00:13:12,566 --> 00:13:16,434
Come on, now, we can work this out.
Shelby, please.

194
00:13:16,804 --> 00:13:18,999
You know you won't go
through with this.

195
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:21,936
You don't have to give back
all the wedding presents.

196
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:25,503
That VCR alone is worth
getting married for.

197
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:28,174
And l love you.

198
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:32,442
lf my daddy catches you here...

199
00:13:32,653 --> 00:13:36,111
...the question of whether or not
l can have your children won't matter.

200
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:37,790
He will cut your thing off.

201
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:39,856
Say you're gonna marry me.

202
00:13:40,728 --> 00:13:42,787
l hate suspense.

203
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:50,429
You meet me 2:00,
Presbyterian Church.

204
00:13:50,637 --> 00:13:53,105
l'll be the one in the veil
down front.

205
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,174
l'm gonna make you very happy.

206
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,121
We'll see.

207
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,254
Give me the sports.

208
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:25,894
Boys...

209
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,367
...we're off to Truvy's. Jonathan,
keep your eye on your brother Tommy.

210
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:33,705
-Am l my brother's keeper?
-You're your brother's warden.

211
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,975
And that horrible woman's coming by to
deliver the groom's cake in about an--

212
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,616
Where's your father?

213
00:14:42,823 --> 00:14:44,723
His coffee kicked in.

214
00:14:48,162 --> 00:14:49,322
Shelby, let's go.

215
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,124
l'm coming, Mama.
l said l'd be right there.

216
00:14:56,537 --> 00:14:59,005
You're gonna be late
for your own wedding.

217
00:14:59,206 --> 00:15:02,334
l'm wearing my hair down
because Jackson likes my hair down.

218
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:04,841
The veil would be prettier
with your hair up.

219
00:15:05,045 --> 00:15:07,036
Get over it, Mama.

220
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,017
Oh, God! Come here! Stop it, Rhett!

221
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,448
Oh, shit!

222
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:17,454
-lt's Miss Ouiser.
-Back door.

223
00:15:21,495 --> 00:15:22,484
Drum!

224
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:23,793
Come here.

225
00:15:23,997 --> 00:15:25,328
M'Lynn!

226
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:27,591
Open the door!
l know you're in there!

227
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:31,604
l think there's somebody at the door.

228
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,568
l think it's for Daddy.

229
00:15:34,074 --> 00:15:36,042
l know you're in there!

230
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:40,307
Say, ''Please.''

231
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,076
Thank you.

232
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:45,543
Get over there, Rhett!

233
00:15:46,086 --> 00:15:47,144
Stop pulling!

234
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:49,048
Sit! Rhett!

235
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:51,483
Sit! Sit!

236
00:15:53,427 --> 00:15:55,861
Ouiser, you look like hammered shit.

237
00:15:56,063 --> 00:15:57,553
Don't you talk to me like that!

238
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,459
l'm sorry.
You look like regular shit.

239
00:16:00,868 --> 00:16:03,063
l have such a bone to pick with you.

240
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,368
Stop egging him on.

241
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:09,405
Come here.

242
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:12,471
l have just come from the vet.

243
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:14,541
Come here, Rhett.

244
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:17,913
Whitey Black says that
all this noise...

245
00:16:18,118 --> 00:16:21,144
...you've been making around here
for the last few days...

246
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,324
...has been causing a nervous
condition in my dog.

247
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,085
Look at this.
All his hair's falling out.

248
00:16:28,996 --> 00:16:30,896
l gotta give this animal
tranquilizers.

249
00:16:31,098 --> 00:16:35,660
Whitey Black is a moron. l'm not
even sure he has opposable thumbs.

250
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:39,236
lf you'll excuse me, l've got
a little work out in the back yard.

251
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,736
Hi, Miss Ouiser.

252
00:16:42,943 --> 00:16:44,410
Leave me alone.

253
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:48,146
Now, you listen to me.
l don't know if l'm coming or going.

254
00:16:48,348 --> 00:16:51,977
l heard you got so screwed up,
you cut your dog out of your will...

255
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:54,745
...and had an ungrateful nephew
put to sleep.

256
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:57,423
l'm about at the end of my rope.

257
00:16:57,624 --> 00:17:00,388
Well, tie a noose in it
and slip it over your head.

258
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,224
Damn it, Ouiser.

259
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,297
l don't wanna kill you.

260
00:17:09,002 --> 00:17:10,401
Boys, bring me my gun!

261
00:17:10,604 --> 00:17:14,700
Don't you threaten me, Drum Eatenton,
or l will call the police.

262
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:19,345
l gotta scare away about 5 zillion
birds before Shelby's reception.

263
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:21,639
lf l don't, l'll have to deal
with my wife.

264
00:17:21,848 --> 00:17:24,043
l make it a point never
to deal with my wife.

265
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,084
That dog is on his last legs.
What'll l do with him?

266
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:29,255
Serve him on toast.

267
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,784
Did you get those magnolias
out of my tree?

268
00:17:34,995 --> 00:17:37,862
The judge has not decided
whose tree that is exactly.

269
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:39,396
lt is mine.

270
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:43,064
l will speak to M'Lynn about this.

271
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:48,431
Now, are these chocolate
chips semisweet or milk?

272
00:17:48,642 --> 00:17:49,666
They're milk.

273
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:51,673
ls the Karo syrup light or dark?

274
00:17:51,878 --> 00:17:53,539
lt's a matter of taste.

275
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:57,012
Where's the other one you were
talking about? ''Cuppa, Cuppa, Cuppa.''

276
00:17:57,217 --> 00:17:59,412
That's simple. You don't need
to write it down.

277
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,522
That's a cup of flour, a cup of sugar,
a cup of fruit cocktail with the juice.

278
00:18:03,724 --> 00:18:07,285
Then you mix and bake at 350
until gold and bubbly.

279
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:09,291
-Sounds awfully rich.
-lt is.

280
00:18:09,496 --> 00:18:12,897
lt is. So l serve it over ice cream
to cut the sweetness.

281
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:14,962
l'll be right back, honey.

282
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:18,160
M'Lynn, it looks like
you're ready to roll.

283
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:21,000
And l think we can trust
Annelle here to do that.

284
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,836
Her coiffure card's
in a little box on the counter.

285
00:18:24,044 --> 00:18:26,410
l don't know.
Today is a very special day.

286
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:28,774
My work is too pouffy
when l'm nervous.

287
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,847
Stop that!
You're a professional now.

288
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:34,043
So just get over there
and bang some hair.

289
00:18:37,524 --> 00:18:39,549
Does your dress have to go
over your head?

290
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:42,017
No.

291
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:43,818
Good.

292
00:18:45,232 --> 00:18:47,097
-l'm sorry.
-Relax.

293
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,597
You can't screw up her hair.

294
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:51,703
Just tease it and make it look
like a brown football helmet.

295
00:18:51,905 --> 00:18:54,533
l must have missed the passage
in Emily Post that said:

296
00:18:54,741 --> 00:18:57,972
''All abuse is heaped
on the mother of the bride.''

297
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,237
Hush, girls.

298
00:19:00,447 --> 00:19:03,610
Your mama never tells us much.
What's Jackson like?

299
00:19:03,817 --> 00:19:04,909
He's really cute.

300
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:09,179
l thought he was a pest at first, but
he kind of grew on me. Now l love him.

301
00:19:09,623 --> 00:19:11,887
You made a very good catch, Shelby.

302
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:15,027
Louisiana lawyers do well,
whether they want to or not.

303
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:16,525
l don't really care.

304
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,494
Don't get me wrong.
The money is real nice and all.

305
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,329
But l just like the idea
of growing old with somebody.

306
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:27,973
My dream is to sit on the porch,
covered with grandchildren, saying:

307
00:19:28,175 --> 00:19:30,439
''No!'' and ''Stop that!''

308
00:19:30,911 --> 00:19:32,572
Will you quit your nursing job?

309
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:34,110
Never! l love it.

310
00:19:34,314 --> 00:19:36,839
l love being around all those babies.

311
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,918
Drum and l both feel that she should
not work after she gets married.

312
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:45,080
l'm so anxious to discuss this topic
for the 900th time this week.

313
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:49,388
You shouldn't be on your feet all day.
Be kind to your circulatory system.

314
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,955
You know what you need in here, Truvy?

315
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:53,461
You need a radio.

316
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,862
Music is a wonderful thing
in the background.

317
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,800
lt takes the pressure off everybody
feeling they have to talk so much.

318
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:02,941
l used to have one, but l
slammed it against the wall...

319
00:20:03,143 --> 00:20:05,771
...when l couldn't figure out
where the batteries went.

320
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:10,439
Of course, l know now l was suffering
from premenstrual syndrome.

321
00:20:11,518 --> 00:20:13,645
Radio? What did l just hear--?

322
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,114
Oh, yes.

323
00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:19,216
The Antilley family is selling KPPD.

324
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:22,524
l wonder how much radio stations
sell for.

325
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:23,889
Miss Clairee.

326
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:27,032
You should buy KPPD.
You got plenty of money.

327
00:20:27,234 --> 00:20:29,225
What would l do with a radio station?

328
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:33,270
Business never interested me.
Lloyd took care of that stuff.

329
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:38,008
l hope you and Jackson will be
as happy as Lloyd and l were.

330
00:20:38,211 --> 00:20:40,805
We had such a good time.

331
00:20:41,314 --> 00:20:42,906
Until November.

332
00:20:45,018 --> 00:20:47,612
At least he hung on through
the state playoffs.

333
00:20:47,821 --> 00:20:50,813
Miss Clairee, there are still
good times to be had.

334
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,553
l really do love football.

335
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:59,421
But it's hard to parlay that
into a reason to live.

336
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:02,324
What are your colors, Shelby?

337
00:21:02,536 --> 00:21:04,902
They're ''blush'' and ''bashful.''

338
00:21:05,205 --> 00:21:07,469
Her colors are ''pink'' and ''pink.''

339
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:10,802
My colors are blush and bashful, Mama.

340
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:13,673
How precious is this wedding
gonna get, l ask you?

341
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,316
My colors are blush and bashful.
l have chosen two shades of pink.

342
00:21:17,517 --> 00:21:19,246
One is much deeper than the other.

343
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:22,979
But the bridesmaids' dresses,
they are really beautiful.

344
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,656
Ceremony will be too.

345
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:29,155
The walls are banked with sprays
of flowers in my two shades...

346
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:30,954
...of blush and bashful.

347
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:35,760
Pink carpets specially laid out for
my service, and pink silk bunting...

348
00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:38,301
...draped over anything
that would stand still.

349
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,440
lt looks like it's been
hosed down with Pepto-Bismol.

350
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:45,133
l like pink. Pink is
my signature color.

351
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,570
How many bridesmaids?

352
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,411
-Nine.
-Nine? Good Lord.

353
00:21:50,617 --> 00:21:54,451
Exactly. Mama made me have my cousins
and Margie St. Maurice.

354
00:21:54,654 --> 00:21:58,283
Let's not go into this now.
You know there was no way around it.

355
00:21:58,491 --> 00:21:59,822
lt will be pretentious.

356
00:22:00,293 --> 00:22:03,729
Daddy says, ''An ounce of pretension
is worth a pound of manure.''

357
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,228
The poet laureate of Dogwood Lane.

358
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:08,492
Mama, l wish you'd get off
Daddy's back.

359
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,535
-l don't wanna get into--
-Fill us in on the reception.

360
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:15,140
My reception! My reception!

361
00:22:15,342 --> 00:22:20,279
Ferns, dancing, tons of people! Every
pink flower west of the Mississippi.

362
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,608
Wedding cake in the dining room
and the groom's cake....

363
00:22:24,117 --> 00:22:25,982
Hidden in the carport?

364
00:22:26,686 --> 00:22:28,950
Shelby and l, we agree on one thing.

365
00:22:29,155 --> 00:22:30,645
The groom's cake.

366
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,257
lt's awful.

367
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:36,355
lt's in the shape
of a giant armadillo.

368
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:39,589
An armadillo? You're joking, right?

369
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:44,259
No. Jackson wanted a cake in the shape
of an armadillo. His aunt makes them.

370
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:45,631
lt's unusual.

371
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,101
lt's repulsive.

372
00:22:47,307 --> 00:22:49,207
lt's got gray icing.

373
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,310
l can't even begin to think
how you'd make gray icing.

374
00:22:52,512 --> 00:22:56,676
Worse, the cake part is
red velvet cake. Blood red.

375
00:22:56,883 --> 00:23:01,217
People will hack into this poor animal
that looks like it's bleeding to death.

376
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,548
The rehearsal supper was
a real experience.

377
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,850
Mama, it wasn't that bad.

378
00:23:06,226 --> 00:23:08,751
lt was out at Jackson's
uncle's place on the river.

379
00:23:08,962 --> 00:23:10,953
He comes from the good
old Southern family...

380
00:23:11,164 --> 00:23:14,600
...with good old Southern values.
You shoot it, stuff it or marry it.

381
00:23:15,702 --> 00:23:17,727
They're simply outdoorsy, that's all.

382
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:21,032
Did y'all do anything
especially romantic?

383
00:23:21,241 --> 00:23:24,506
We drove down to Frenchmen's Point
and went parking.

384
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:28,179
Oh, Shelby. Really!

385
00:23:28,882 --> 00:23:31,749
M'Lynn, leave her alone.
This is my favorite part.

386
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:35,752
This is the romantic part. See,
that's what really melts my butter.

387
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:40,552
Then we went skinny dipping, and we did
things that frightened the fish.

388
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,923
lt's been a long time since we've had
a youngster in this place.

389
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,155
We talked and talked and talked....

390
00:23:46,366 --> 00:23:50,769
l love those kind of talks
in the arms of the man you love.

391
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:53,264
Actually, we fought most of the time.

392
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,940
You fought?

393
00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:57,173
l told him l wouldn't marry him.

394
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:58,808
What?

395
00:23:59,446 --> 00:24:01,209
Why'd you go do a thing like that?

396
00:24:01,414 --> 00:24:03,939
lt's okay now. We worked it all out.

397
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:08,346
lt's probably just one of those
last-minute jitter things.

398
00:24:08,555 --> 00:24:10,386
No, but the wedding's still on.

399
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,989
Well, thank goodness.

400
00:24:12,192 --> 00:24:16,253
Because this is going
in the Hairdo Hall of Fame.

401
00:24:16,463 --> 00:24:20,092
Shelby, you scared us. That wasn't
a nice thing to do to your mama.

402
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,293
Never say that to a woman who's
marinating 50 pounds of crab claws.

403
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:28,334
But the making up can be so romantic.

404
00:24:30,076 --> 00:24:32,044
l miss romance so much.

405
00:24:32,245 --> 00:24:34,770
Truvy, it can't be that bad.

406
00:24:34,981 --> 00:24:35,970
Oh, really, now?

407
00:24:36,182 --> 00:24:40,243
The last romantic thing my husband
did for me was back in 1 972.

408
00:24:40,453 --> 00:24:43,547
He enclosed this carport
so l could support him.

409
00:24:43,757 --> 00:24:46,749
l think l have something
that could cheer you up.

410
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,726
Drum and l plan to talk to your husband
about adding on to our house.

411
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,158
M'Lynn, are you serious?

412
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:55,198
lf you give Spud a job,
l'll give you hot oil treatments...

413
00:24:55,402 --> 00:24:57,427
...for the rest of your life!

414
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:02,364
Annelle, this looks pretty good.
l think you know what you're doing.

415
00:25:02,575 --> 00:25:03,906
Thank you.

416
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,408
Mrs. Eatenton, you have great hair.

417
00:25:06,613 --> 00:25:09,514
-Your scalp's as clean as a whistle.
-l try.

418
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,013
lt must run in the family.

419
00:25:11,217 --> 00:25:15,677
This young'un's got the prettiest hair
l've ever had my hands in. So thick.

420
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:19,347
Just because l'm bragging on you
don't mean you can get lazy on me.

421
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,423
Stop it.

422
00:25:20,627 --> 00:25:21,457
Shelby?

423
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:24,162
Shelby! M'Lynn!

424
00:25:26,032 --> 00:25:27,897
l'll get some juice.

425
00:25:29,469 --> 00:25:31,096
There's some candy in my purse.

426
00:25:31,304 --> 00:25:33,295
l have some right here.

427
00:25:34,674 --> 00:25:36,232
Shelby. Shelby.

428
00:25:36,443 --> 00:25:38,968
Hold on. Clairee's
getting you some juice.

429
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,710
-Should l get her a cookie?
-No.

430
00:25:41,981 --> 00:25:42,811
Juice is better.

431
00:25:44,284 --> 00:25:45,410
Here's the juice.

432
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:49,120
You need some juice.
You need some juice.

433
00:25:49,322 --> 00:25:51,290
-Stop it, Mama.
-Drink the juice.

434
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:53,459
-Please drink the juice.
-No!

435
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,992
Stop it! l have
some candy in my purse.

436
00:25:56,196 --> 00:25:57,823
You didn't bring your purse.

437
00:25:58,031 --> 00:26:00,022
You didn't bring your purse.
No, you didn't.

438
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:02,326
No, here you go. There you go.

439
00:26:02,535 --> 00:26:04,093
Drink some of this.

440
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,239
lt's not any wonder...

441
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,068
...with all this running around
and wedding nonsense.

442
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:14,141
Excuse me. Should l call
the doctor or something?

443
00:26:14,347 --> 00:26:15,405
She's a diabetic.

444
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:18,209
She just has a little too much
insulin, that's all.

445
00:26:18,418 --> 00:26:21,080
We'll get a little more in her.
She'll be all right.

446
00:26:21,521 --> 00:26:24,183
lf you don't leave me alone,
l'm gonna leave.

447
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,655
l'd love to see you try.
Cooperate, please.

448
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:29,658
Honey, drink. Please.

449
00:26:29,863 --> 00:26:31,524
Come on, now. Thattagirl.

450
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:33,323
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

451
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,761
There you go. There you go.

452
00:26:36,002 --> 00:26:38,095
There, there. That's a start.

453
00:26:38,338 --> 00:26:40,499
This one hit her fast.

454
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,206
She's been so upset lately.

455
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:47,077
Dr. Mitchell told her
on her last appointment...

456
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:50,180
...children aren't possible.

457
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:55,278
Don't talk about me like l'm not here.

458
00:26:57,624 --> 00:27:00,650
She's making some sense now.
Yes, she is.

459
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,691
This one was not bad at all.
lt was not bad at all.

460
00:27:04,898 --> 00:27:07,366
l think we need
a little more juice.

461
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:09,432
Could l do something to help?

462
00:27:09,636 --> 00:27:10,728
No, no.

463
00:27:10,937 --> 00:27:12,928
She'll be fine.
Don't fuss over her.

464
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:15,004
Normality's very important to Shelby.

465
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:16,698
-Here, M'Lynn.
-Thanks.

466
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:20,245
l'm really sorry about
the children part, M'Lynn.

467
00:27:20,446 --> 00:27:21,572
l know.

468
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:25,510
She's afraid Jackson will be throwing
away his chance to have children.

469
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,420
Jackson said:

470
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,291
''Shelby, don't be stupid.

471
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,758
There's plenty of kids out there
need good homes.''

472
00:27:36,963 --> 00:27:38,191
Drink some.

473
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:45,096
''We'll adopt 1 0 of them.
We'll buy them if we have to.''

474
00:27:45,438 --> 00:27:47,838
Jackson sounds like good people to me.

475
00:27:56,816 --> 00:28:00,047
-Mama, l'm sorry.
-That's all right, honey.

476
00:28:00,253 --> 00:28:03,051
lt's all right.
lt's all over now. lt's all--

477
00:28:03,256 --> 00:28:04,883
You hold your juice.

478
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,092
lt's all over.

479
00:28:07,293 --> 00:28:09,523
Hold your juice, all right?

480
00:28:11,497 --> 00:28:12,725
You all right?

481
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:15,767
-Truvy, l'm sorry.
-l'll fix it.

482
00:28:16,436 --> 00:28:18,267
We'll fix it.

483
00:28:27,614 --> 00:28:30,082
-What did l do with my gun?
-Where'd you leave it?

484
00:28:30,283 --> 00:28:32,012
How the hell do l know?

485
00:28:33,953 --> 00:28:36,581
Come on, we have work to do.
Daylight's burning.

486
00:28:37,023 --> 00:28:38,923
We're gonna get rid of some birds!

487
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,495
-Got the arrows, Daddy.
-All right.

488
00:28:48,368 --> 00:28:50,233
Look here. Look here.

489
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:55,836
-l got the targets.
-We're not going target shooting.

490
00:28:57,577 --> 00:29:00,011
Miss Clairee, what cute shoes!

491
00:29:00,213 --> 00:29:01,407
You think so?

492
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:03,605
l'm not so sure myself.

493
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,141
They seem a little too racy for me.

494
00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:07,649
l'll probably give them away.

495
00:29:07,854 --> 00:29:09,981
They're just too ''cha-cha'' for words.

496
00:29:10,189 --> 00:29:12,453
lf you decide to get rid of them,
l'll buy them.

497
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:13,648
What size you wear?

498
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,456
ln a good shoe, l wear a size 6.
But a 7 feels so good, l buy a size 8.

499
00:29:18,665 --> 00:29:20,860
-They're 8 1/2.
-Perfect.

500
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:22,959
Lord, give us strength!

501
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,302
Come here, Rhett!

502
00:29:27,573 --> 00:29:30,474
That is one ugly dog.
What kind of dog is that?

503
00:29:30,677 --> 00:29:33,043
lf it had hair,
it'd be a Saint Bernard.

504
00:29:34,013 --> 00:29:36,607
This is it. l have found it.
l am in hell.

505
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,041
Good morning, Ouiser.

506
00:29:38,351 --> 00:29:41,650
Don't try to get on my good side,
Truvy. l no longer have one.

507
00:29:41,854 --> 00:29:44,186
-Come here, Rhett.
-You're a little early.

508
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,724
That is precisely why l'm here. l've
gotta talk to M'Lynn about her husband.

509
00:29:49,362 --> 00:29:52,126
He is a boil on the butt of humanity.

510
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,199
l'm sorry. This whole thing
has gotten out of hand.

511
00:29:55,401 --> 00:29:57,198
lt's not your fault, M'Lynn.

512
00:29:57,804 --> 00:30:00,364
l used to think you were crazy
for marrying that man.

513
00:30:00,573 --> 00:30:03,406
Then l thought you
were a glutton for punishment.

514
00:30:03,876 --> 00:30:07,334
Now l realize you must be
on some mission from God.

515
00:30:07,547 --> 00:30:12,484
Daddy isn't trying to drive you crazy.
He's trying to make my reception nice.

516
00:30:12,752 --> 00:30:14,743
His heart's in the right place.

517
00:30:14,954 --> 00:30:18,720
Ouiser, l know for a fact there
will be no more gunshots.

518
00:30:18,925 --> 00:30:21,052
But he was gonna fire a gun at me.

519
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,253
They're blanks. Drum would never,
ever point a gun at a lady.

520
00:30:26,265 --> 00:30:27,391
He's a real gentleman.

521
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,728
l bet he takes the dishes out
of the sink before he pees in it.

522
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:41,373
Who the hell are you?

523
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:46,748
-Ouiser, this is my new--
-Fine.

524
00:30:46,953 --> 00:30:49,012
Now, l know everybody in this town.

525
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,055
And l don't recall
having seen you before.

526
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,383
l just moved into town
not too long ago.

527
00:30:55,595 --> 00:30:57,153
With your family?

528
00:30:58,164 --> 00:30:59,688
l don't have any family.

529
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,560
Your husband?

530
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,267
My husband?

531
00:31:05,471 --> 00:31:06,460
Yes.

532
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,436
That's kind of hard to say.

533
00:31:12,545 --> 00:31:13,534
l don't know.

534
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,077
You don't know?

535
00:31:16,015 --> 00:31:17,312
Well, l'm not sure.

536
00:31:18,184 --> 00:31:19,378
You're not sure?

537
00:31:19,585 --> 00:31:24,249
l'm intrigued. Are you married or not?
These are not difficult questions.

538
00:31:32,331 --> 00:31:33,628
l can't talk about it.

539
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:35,164
Of course you can.

540
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,797
Well, l'm not sure if l'm married
or not. He's gone.

541
00:31:42,175 --> 00:31:46,475
Men are the most horrible creatures,
honey. They will ruin your life.

542
00:31:47,013 --> 00:31:48,571
Everything is horrible.

543
00:31:49,348 --> 00:31:52,749
Bunkie, that's my husband,
he just vanished last week.

544
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,785
He took all the money,
my jewelry, the car.

545
00:31:55,988 --> 00:31:58,013
Most of my clothes were in the trunk.

546
00:31:58,224 --> 00:32:00,192
He's in big trouble with the law.

547
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,928
Drugs or something.

548
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:07,823
The police keep questioning me,
but l don't know anything.

549
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:10,863
They say that our marriage
may not be legal.

550
00:32:11,737 --> 00:32:14,297
l wish you'd have said something.

551
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:18,474
l was scared to.
l need a job in the worst way.

552
00:32:18,678 --> 00:32:22,273
l didn't know if you'd hire someone
who may or may not be married...

553
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,417
...to someone who might be
a dangerous criminal.

554
00:32:25,618 --> 00:32:28,985
But, Miss Truvy, l swear to you
that my personal tragedy...

555
00:32:29,188 --> 00:32:32,021
...will not interfere with
my ability to do good hair.

556
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,190
Of course it won't.

557
00:32:35,695 --> 00:32:37,788
l don't think things
could get any worse.

558
00:32:38,297 --> 00:32:39,559
Of course they can.

559
00:32:39,765 --> 00:32:41,289
We are awful.

560
00:32:41,634 --> 00:32:44,034
We are all hateful, awful people.

561
00:32:44,237 --> 00:32:48,173
Here, all we've been talking about
is weddings and psychotic animals.

562
00:32:48,374 --> 00:32:50,205
What can we do to help?

563
00:32:50,443 --> 00:32:51,705
l know one thing l can do.

564
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:55,739
Today you'll drop by my house
and have some bleeding armadillo cake.

565
00:32:55,948 --> 00:32:56,972
Oh, yes, you must.

566
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,377
l couldn't.

567
00:32:58,584 --> 00:33:01,075
l still get real emotional sometimes.

568
00:33:01,287 --> 00:33:04,484
Not today, you won't. lt is going
to be a great party.

569
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,650
l don't have anything to wear.

570
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:11,690
No problem. l bet l have something
that'll do. l'll call the house.

571
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:14,057
Thanks.

572
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,734
All right.

573
00:33:18,938 --> 00:33:20,269
Load me up.

574
00:33:23,643 --> 00:33:24,473
Ready?

575
00:33:24,677 --> 00:33:25,769
All right.

576
00:33:25,978 --> 00:33:27,070
Ready.

577
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,842
All right.

578
00:33:29,148 --> 00:33:31,514
Are you ready?
Stand back. Here we go!

579
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,794
What the hell is that?

580
00:33:50,303 --> 00:33:52,168
Got them right between the legs!

581
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:54,236
All right, you nailed them!

582
00:33:57,843 --> 00:34:01,142
l hope no one was hurt.
Shelby, get my things.

583
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,982
Miss Ouiser, that dog
will eat Daddy alive!

584
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,594
Ouiser, talk to your dog!
He'll listen to you!

585
00:34:16,796 --> 00:34:19,424
-lt's my wedding day!
-Say something to your dog!

586
00:34:19,632 --> 00:34:21,463
Kill, Rhett! Kill!

587
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:23,601
Daddy, what happened?

588
00:34:23,803 --> 00:34:25,634
Bite him in the balls!

589
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,404
Sorry.

590
00:35:27,633 --> 00:35:28,725
l'm sorry.

591
00:35:33,105 --> 00:35:34,094
Now.

592
00:35:35,408 --> 00:35:36,397
Shelby.

593
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,403
Shelby, it's time.

594
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,047
Daddy.

595
00:35:42,248 --> 00:35:43,647
lt's time.

596
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,341
Daddy, it's time.

597
00:35:46,886 --> 00:35:49,184
-lt's time!
-lt's time?

598
00:36:56,622 --> 00:36:59,216
Who gives this woman in marriage?

599
00:37:00,926 --> 00:37:02,951
Her mother and l do.

600
00:37:09,668 --> 00:37:11,363
Dearly beloved....

601
00:37:25,184 --> 00:37:27,618
This has been the happiest day
of my life, Daddy.

602
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,754
l'm glad, sugar.

603
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:31,581
l'm not talking too loud, am l?

604
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,224
No, you're fine.

605
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,990
Shelby loves you very much.

606
00:37:37,997 --> 00:37:39,487
l hope so.

607
00:37:39,765 --> 00:37:42,256
Cost me 60 bucks to rent this sucker.

608
00:37:43,068 --> 00:37:44,933
l'm being serious.

609
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,263
So am l.

610
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,406
l got the receipt right here.

611
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:52,274
Could l say this, please?

612
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:56,842
Shelby is so happy.

613
00:37:59,051 --> 00:38:01,042
l know when you're young...

614
00:38:01,453 --> 00:38:05,082
...it seems like everything will always
be perfect. Maybe it will be.

615
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,329
Promise to think about it before you
make any big decisions about family.

616
00:38:12,531 --> 00:38:14,158
l know what you're saying.

617
00:38:16,235 --> 00:38:17,361
Good.

618
00:38:49,602 --> 00:38:51,092
What can l get you?

619
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,901
Nothing. No, thanks.

620
00:38:53,105 --> 00:38:54,970
You sure? lt's free.

621
00:38:56,942 --> 00:38:58,534
Come on, what'll it be?

622
00:38:59,311 --> 00:39:00,801
A cherry Coke.

623
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,669
Sure.

624
00:39:06,285 --> 00:39:09,049
So are you a friend of the bride
or the groom?

625
00:39:09,255 --> 00:39:10,085
Neither.

626
00:39:11,156 --> 00:39:13,283
Shelby invited me.

627
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,591
l don't know why l'm here.

628
00:39:15,794 --> 00:39:17,193
l'm Sammy.

629
00:39:17,963 --> 00:39:21,126
This is the best cherry Coke
in the history of the world.

630
00:39:32,811 --> 00:39:34,301
Can l help you, sir?

631
00:39:41,153 --> 00:39:42,586
That Jackson...

632
00:39:42,788 --> 00:39:44,619
...he is one big hanging man.

633
00:39:44,823 --> 00:39:46,154
Yes, l know.

634
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:48,451
Nancy Beth, come along.

635
00:39:49,128 --> 00:39:50,493
Calories, calories.

636
00:39:50,696 --> 00:39:52,527
Calories, calories.

637
00:39:52,998 --> 00:39:54,761
l don't like Belle Marmillion.

638
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:58,596
l don't trust anybody that does
their own hair. That's not normal.

639
00:39:58,804 --> 00:40:01,329
She's our best volunteer
at the Mental Guidance Center.

640
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,440
She's so good with troubled children.

641
00:40:03,642 --> 00:40:06,202
Wish l had taken Louie there
when he was little.

642
00:40:06,412 --> 00:40:08,073
l should've known he had problems...

643
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,771
...when his imaginary playmates
wouldn't play with him.

644
00:40:10,983 --> 00:40:13,918
Your boy grew up fine.
He's just a little scary, that's all.

645
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:18,613
l think it'd be fun to have access to
all that secret, personal information.

646
00:40:18,824 --> 00:40:22,920
Come on, M'Lynn. Won't you tell me
some of your most bizarre cases?

647
00:40:23,128 --> 00:40:25,653
Let me see if l can
figure out who they are.

648
00:40:25,864 --> 00:40:28,196
There's some pretty sick tickets
in this town.

649
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,163
l'll do no such thing.
Cut that out.

650
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:31,597
You old fuddy-duddy.

651
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:46,612
l'm not speaking to you.

652
00:40:47,553 --> 00:40:49,180
What a shame.

653
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,978
l mean it, Drum.

654
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,989
Can we call a truce long enough
for me to get a piece of cake?

655
00:41:03,602 --> 00:41:04,728
Thanks.

656
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,568
Nothing like a good piece of ass.

657
00:41:10,943 --> 00:41:15,004
l'd rather walk on my lips
than to criticize anybody.

658
00:41:15,814 --> 00:41:16,803
But...

659
00:41:17,316 --> 00:41:18,613
...Janice van Meter....

660
00:41:18,817 --> 00:41:19,806
l know.

661
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,079
l'll bet you money she paid $500
for that dress...

662
00:41:23,288 --> 00:41:25,313
...and don't even bother
to wear a girdle.

663
00:41:25,657 --> 00:41:29,058
Looks like two pigs fighting
under a blanket.

664
00:41:31,897 --> 00:41:36,391
l haven't left the house without Lycra
on these thighs since l was 14.

665
00:41:36,602 --> 00:41:38,160
You were brought up right.

666
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,203
Congratulations, Drum.
Fantastic party.

667
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,872
Ouiser, there's someone
l'd like you to meet.

668
00:41:48,414 --> 00:41:49,972
That looks like an autopsy.

669
00:41:50,182 --> 00:41:53,345
This is Jackson's
Aunt Fern Thornton...

670
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:55,616
...from Alexandria.

671
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,647
She made the cake.

672
00:41:58,524 --> 00:41:59,718
You did this?

673
00:41:59,925 --> 00:42:00,914
Guilty.

674
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:05,493
But it's very simple, really.
lt just takes patience.

675
00:42:05,964 --> 00:42:07,591
You only do armadillos?

676
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,495
No, l can do anything.

677
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:10,963
Except snakes.

678
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:13,297
l don't have the counter space.

679
00:43:39,424 --> 00:43:40,413
Mama.

680
00:43:41,627 --> 00:43:42,855
Help me.

681
00:43:54,373 --> 00:43:55,601
Well, this is it.

682
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:57,570
You're finally rid of me.

683
00:43:59,711 --> 00:44:02,179
l think you'll be back
every now and then.

684
00:44:04,316 --> 00:44:07,547
Corsages are pretty stupid
when you think about it, aren't they?

685
00:44:08,086 --> 00:44:10,782
You make Jackson Latcherie
take good care of you.

686
00:44:12,224 --> 00:44:14,590
Mama, Jackson will take care of me.

687
00:44:14,993 --> 00:44:16,893
And l'll take care of him.

688
00:44:18,263 --> 00:44:20,163
And l'm not stupid.

689
00:44:22,234 --> 00:44:24,031
l'll get my bags.

690
00:44:53,098 --> 00:44:55,862
Well, the boys just brought
the car around.

691
00:44:56,201 --> 00:44:57,964
What did they do to it?

692
00:45:00,272 --> 00:45:02,365
Let me put it this way.

693
00:45:03,141 --> 00:45:05,837
lf you and Jackson want
to practice safe sex...

694
00:45:06,044 --> 00:45:07,238
...you're all set.

695
00:45:53,859 --> 00:45:55,918
Truvy, are you leaving so early?

696
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,722
l'll have some sweet dreams
with this under my pillow.

697
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,864
Tell your husband l hope
he feels better.

698
00:46:01,066 --> 00:46:02,124
He's gonna be fine.

699
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:04,029
-Say hello to Spud.
-l'll do it.

700
00:46:04,236 --> 00:46:07,569
l'm sure he's sorry he missed all this.
lt was a beautiful wedding.

701
00:46:07,773 --> 00:46:09,798
-Thanks, Truvy.
-Thanks a lot. Bye.

702
00:46:10,075 --> 00:46:11,508
You leaving so soon?

703
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:35,397
Hi.

704
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:36,856
Hello.

705
00:46:40,105 --> 00:46:42,630
Would you like a ride?

706
00:46:46,912 --> 00:46:48,812
l have new shoes.

707
00:46:49,214 --> 00:46:50,977
l have to break them in.

708
00:46:56,288 --> 00:46:58,586
-Good night.
-Keep her away from me.

709
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:00,155
Stop it.

710
00:47:00,892 --> 00:47:03,019
Walk me home, Clairee.

711
00:47:03,228 --> 00:47:04,593
You just live over there.

712
00:47:04,796 --> 00:47:07,196
l don't wanna walk
in that house by myself.

713
00:47:07,399 --> 00:47:11,597
You watch the evening news. You know
what kind of world we're living in.

714
00:47:11,803 --> 00:47:14,670
-Walk me home.
-Who's gonna walk me home?

715
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,363
You've got the flashlight.

716
00:47:16,575 --> 00:47:18,873
-My car's parked over there.
-Come on, l wanna--

717
00:47:19,077 --> 00:47:22,274
This is ridiculous! You're only
a few feet away from here.

718
00:47:22,481 --> 00:47:23,505
Follow me.

719
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:27,378
You're acting like a child. The older
you get, the sillier you get.

720
00:47:27,586 --> 00:47:30,419
And the older you get,
the uglier you get.

721
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:56,138
And last, but never least,
Santa's most beautiful helper...

722
00:47:56,348 --> 00:48:01,081
...this year's Miss Merry Christmas,
Nancy Beth Marmillion!

723
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:11,426
Get it while the getting's good!
Best food in Louisiana!

724
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:16,567
Blood, sweat and tears go in every
little bowlful. Right, boys?

725
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:18,235
That's right, Truvy.

726
00:48:20,071 --> 00:48:21,732
One, two, three, four.

727
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,134
Shelby!

728
00:48:23,475 --> 00:48:26,069
Get your little country
butt over here.

729
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:30,408
Were you trying to sneak by us without
buying some of our jumbo shrimp?

730
00:48:30,615 --> 00:48:32,947
They're hot and spicy,
just like Annelle.

731
00:48:33,151 --> 00:48:34,140
Stop!

732
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:37,613
Try one. We've already pulled
their little heads off them.

733
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:42,856
l'm just killing time. Jackson's found
a firearm. We may never see him again.

734
00:48:43,061 --> 00:48:45,757
How about some iced tea?
lt's the house wine of the South.

735
00:48:46,198 --> 00:48:48,359
-Perfect.
-Oh, coming up.

736
00:48:48,567 --> 00:48:51,263
Your mama's happy you got
home in time for the festival.

737
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,667
l wouldn't miss the festival for
the world. How's your family?

738
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,300
Fine. Spud's as outgoing as ever.

739
00:48:58,777 --> 00:49:02,543
Louie brought his girlfriend home.
The nicest thing l can say about her is...

740
00:49:02,747 --> 00:49:05,113
...all her tattoos
are spelled correctly.

741
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,284
Truvy!

742
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,453
-Put your money away.
-Thanks.

743
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:14,952
My hair's not the only thing that's
changed. So much has happened.

744
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,426
After they finally put Bunkie Dupuy
behind bars and l was rid of him...

745
00:49:19,631 --> 00:49:23,624
...l went wild. l was running around,
drinking, smoking--

746
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:25,097
Jezebel!

747
00:49:25,604 --> 00:49:29,700
Truvy helped me see the error of my
ways. She gave me a place to live.

748
00:49:29,908 --> 00:49:34,572
l go to church. l've done guest
lectures on beauty at the trade school.

749
00:49:34,779 --> 00:49:38,681
Our little Annelle here has become
one of the hottest tickets in town.

750
00:49:38,884 --> 00:49:40,146
lt's true.

751
00:49:40,685 --> 00:49:45,315
l am enjoying the city more, and l'm so
excited about this Christmas festival.

752
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,788
There's a Messiah sing-along tomorrow.

753
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:51,452
-What's the matter?
-Nobody move! Nobody move!

754
00:49:51,663 --> 00:49:53,153
My contact!

755
00:49:53,999 --> 00:49:56,160
-Stay back. Stay back.
-Don't move!

756
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,665
Can you back up, please?

757
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,336
Hello, darlings!

758
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,233
When did you get into town?

759
00:50:01,439 --> 00:50:02,872
This afternoon.

760
00:50:03,241 --> 00:50:04,708
Here. Merry Christmas.

761
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:08,346
l'm showing Jackson everything.
He's never been to the festival.

762
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,947
Make sure you listen
to the football game tonight.

763
00:50:11,149 --> 00:50:12,514
What are we listening for?

764
00:50:12,717 --> 00:50:15,379
Me. l'm a working gal now.
Didn't your mama tell you?

765
00:50:15,587 --> 00:50:17,680
Mama never tells anyone anything.

766
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,619
l'm the color announcer
for the Devils. l'm fabulous.

767
00:50:20,825 --> 00:50:23,259
l'm just too colorful for words.

768
00:50:23,461 --> 00:50:25,122
Nice of them to let you
on the radio.

769
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:29,130
Nice, nothing.
l own the radio station.

770
00:50:29,334 --> 00:50:30,596
-You bought it?
-Yes.

771
00:50:30,802 --> 00:50:32,167
KPPD...

772
00:50:32,504 --> 00:50:35,598
...the station of choice
in Chinquapin Parish.

773
00:50:35,807 --> 00:50:37,104
Mrs. Belcher, we've gotta go!

774
00:50:37,309 --> 00:50:39,140
-Bye!
-Kickoff!

775
00:50:53,959 --> 00:50:55,153
Well?

776
00:50:58,463 --> 00:51:00,658
Rolly Bassett got the contract.

777
00:51:01,166 --> 00:51:03,100
His bid was 6000 under mine.

778
00:51:03,301 --> 00:51:04,768
Six thousand?

779
00:51:06,538 --> 00:51:09,632
He owns all his own equipment
and l don't.

780
00:51:12,711 --> 00:51:15,179
lt's hell to be poor and hired out.

781
00:51:16,648 --> 00:51:20,812
l have got some fried chicken here,
prepared by Christian women...

782
00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:22,418
...a bottle of cheap wine...

783
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:26,352
...and l've arranged for some
pretty incredible fireworks.

784
00:51:28,326 --> 00:51:29,657
Come on, Spud.

785
00:51:29,861 --> 00:51:34,423
l don't wanna miss the Nativity made
entirely out of sparklers.

786
00:51:35,867 --> 00:51:40,065
-l don't feel much like it.
-You will once we get there.

787
00:51:41,272 --> 00:51:43,365
l'm happy where l am.

788
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:50,338
We always watch the fireworks.

789
00:51:52,917 --> 00:51:55,442
This is KPPD radio...

790
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:58,521
...station of choice
in Chinquapin Parish...

791
00:51:58,723 --> 00:52:02,215
...coming to you live
from the Devils' locker room.

792
00:52:02,427 --> 00:52:06,989
This is Bark Boone
with color announcer Clairee Belcher.

793
00:52:07,198 --> 00:52:08,790
Thank you, Bark.

794
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,128
You know, it's a shame
our listeners can't be here...

795
00:52:12,537 --> 00:52:15,665
...to see the gorgeous
new Devil uniform.

796
00:52:16,841 --> 00:52:18,001
They're lovely.

797
00:52:18,209 --> 00:52:21,178
l myself would never have chosen
those white pants.

798
00:52:21,379 --> 00:52:24,610
l would've gone with a darker color.
White shows everything.

799
00:52:24,816 --> 00:52:27,979
Just look at those grass stains.
lmpossible to get out.

800
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:31,087
lt's hard to keep white clean
when you're tackled.

801
00:52:31,289 --> 00:52:32,881
But l love the tops.

802
00:52:33,091 --> 00:52:34,183
Such a vibrant purple.

803
00:52:34,392 --> 00:52:37,327
Bark, would you call this color
grape or aubergine?

804
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,826
Shut up!

805
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,027
What?

806
00:52:40,231 --> 00:52:42,722
You're making a fool out of yourself.

807
00:52:42,934 --> 00:52:43,923
l am not!

808
00:52:44,135 --> 00:52:45,432
This is football.

809
00:52:45,637 --> 00:52:48,731
All people wanna hear about
is touchdowns and injuries.

810
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:51,568
They don't give a damn
about that grape shit.

811
00:52:52,177 --> 00:52:55,237
We have a new psychiatrist
that comes in two days a week.

812
00:52:55,447 --> 00:52:58,314
Of course, l pick her name
out of the grab bag.

813
00:52:58,516 --> 00:53:02,350
l've gotta get something for her.
Would you put that on the list?

814
00:53:02,587 --> 00:53:06,455
l have no idea
what to get your father.

815
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:09,219
What's Jackson giving you?
Do you know?

816
00:53:10,795 --> 00:53:11,625
Furniture.

817
00:53:12,964 --> 00:53:14,693
Furniture? Well, my!

818
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,833
Must be nice to be married
to a rich lawyer.

819
00:53:19,671 --> 00:53:20,933
For the living room?

820
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,802
No, for the nursery.

821
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:33,210
We wanted to tell you when you and
Daddy were together, but you never are.

822
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:35,079
lt's every man for himself.

823
00:53:37,322 --> 00:53:38,448
l'm pregnant.

824
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,484
l realize that.

825
00:53:46,998 --> 00:53:48,465
ls that it?

826
00:53:49,534 --> 00:53:50,967
ls that all you're gonna say?

827
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:54,438
What do you want me to say?

828
00:53:55,707 --> 00:53:58,175
Something along the lines of
''Congratulations.''

829
00:54:01,246 --> 00:54:02,474
Congratulations.

830
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:17,193
Would it be too much to ask...

831
00:54:18,997 --> 00:54:20,624
...for a little excitement?

832
00:54:20,832 --> 00:54:24,268
Not too much. l wouldn't want you
to break a sweat or anything.

833
00:54:29,607 --> 00:54:31,097
lt's in July.

834
00:54:37,982 --> 00:54:40,041
You have to help me plan.

835
00:54:42,086 --> 00:54:43,678
We're gonna get a new house.

836
00:54:43,888 --> 00:54:46,550
Jackson and l are going
house hunting next week.

837
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,955
He loves to hunt for anything.

838
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:52,987
-What does Jackson say about all this?
-He's so excited.

839
00:54:54,365 --> 00:54:57,425
He says he doesn't care
whether it's a boy or a girl...

840
00:54:57,635 --> 00:55:00,934
...but l know he really wants
a son so bad he can taste it.

841
00:55:02,273 --> 00:55:04,707
He's cute about it.
lt's all he talks about.

842
00:55:04,909 --> 00:55:06,342
''Jackson Latcherie, Jr.''

843
00:55:06,544 --> 00:55:07,841
Does he ever listen?

844
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:11,209
When doctors and specialists
give you advice...

845
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:12,811
...does he listen?

846
00:55:13,017 --> 00:55:14,746
l know you never do. Does he?

847
00:55:20,258 --> 00:55:21,088
What?

848
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:28,996
l guess since he doesn't have to carry
the baby, it isn't any of his concern.

849
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,861
l want a child.

850
00:55:34,439 --> 00:55:36,999
What about adoption?
You filled out applications.

851
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:41,645
No judge is going to give a baby
to someone with my medical record.

852
00:55:44,415 --> 00:55:46,508
Jackson put out feelers
about buying one.

853
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,379
People do it all the time.

854
00:55:51,155 --> 00:55:52,622
Listen to me.

855
00:55:54,826 --> 00:55:56,760
l want a child of my own.

856
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,726
l think it would help things a lot.

857
00:56:13,511 --> 00:56:14,910
l see.

858
00:56:27,992 --> 00:56:30,085
You worry too much.

859
00:56:31,663 --> 00:56:36,191
l never worry, because l always know
you're worried enough for both of us.

860
00:56:41,873 --> 00:56:44,307
Jackson and l gave this
a lot of thought.

861
00:56:44,509 --> 00:56:48,411
-There's a first time for everything.
-Don't start on Jackson.

862
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:52,709
Your body has been through so much.
Why would you do this to yourself?

863
00:56:52,917 --> 00:56:57,183
-Diabetics have healthy babies.
-You are special, Shelby.

864
00:56:57,889 --> 00:57:00,551
There are limits to what you can do.

865
00:57:07,832 --> 00:57:09,697
l am going to be...

866
00:57:10,368 --> 00:57:12,199
...very, very careful.

867
00:57:13,404 --> 00:57:16,339
Nobody's gonna be hurt
or disappointed...

868
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:18,099
...or even inconvenienced.

869
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,673
Least of all Jackson, l'm sure.

870
00:57:25,583 --> 00:57:26,777
You're jealous.

871
00:57:27,952 --> 00:57:30,546
You no longer have
a say-so in what l do...

872
00:57:30,755 --> 00:57:32,950
...and that drives you up the wall.

873
00:57:34,092 --> 00:57:37,960
You're ready to spit nails
because you can't call the shots.

874
00:57:39,197 --> 00:57:42,598
l did not raise my daughter
to talk to me like this.

875
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,566
-Yes, you did.
-No, l didn't.

876
00:57:47,972 --> 00:57:52,136
Whenever we asked what you wanted
for us when we grew up, what'd you say?

877
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,038
l'm not in the mood to play games.

878
00:57:54,245 --> 00:57:56,770
Just tell me what you said.
What did you say?

879
00:57:56,981 --> 00:58:00,815
The only thing l have ever said to you
is that l want you to be happy.

880
00:58:02,286 --> 00:58:05,813
The one thing that would make me happy
is to have a baby.

881
00:58:06,891 --> 00:58:09,860
lf l could adopt one, l would,
but l can't.

882
00:58:12,196 --> 00:58:16,155
l'm going to have a baby,
and l wish you'd be happy too.

883
00:58:17,135 --> 00:58:19,103
l'll tell you what l wish.

884
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,904
l don't know what l wish.

885
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:29,403
l don't know why you have to make
everything so difficult.

886
00:58:32,417 --> 00:58:36,478
l look at having this baby
as the opportunity of a lifetime.

887
00:58:36,821 --> 00:58:40,450
Sure, there may be risk involved,
but that's true for anybody.

888
00:58:41,426 --> 00:58:43,986
But you get through it
and life goes on.

889
00:58:44,429 --> 00:58:47,557
When all's said and done,
there'll be a piece of immortality...

890
00:58:47,765 --> 00:58:51,030
...with Jackson's good looks
and my sense of style, l hope.

891
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:53,202
Please.

892
00:58:53,638 --> 00:58:54,935
Please.

893
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:58,238
l need your support.

894
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:03,805
l would rather have 30 minutes
of wonderful...

895
00:59:04,015 --> 00:59:06,540
...than a lifetime of nothing special.

896
00:59:25,069 --> 00:59:27,560
l'll hand it to you.
l don't wanna hit you.

897
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:30,673
-Okay, l got one hole left.
-Right.

898
00:59:31,042 --> 00:59:34,307
Put the cords so they don't show.
lt'll look tacky.

899
00:59:34,512 --> 00:59:36,480
You told me about 40 times.

900
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:41,650
Did you do all this?

901
00:59:42,053 --> 00:59:43,247
Guilty.

902
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:47,083
Truvy just turned over
the decoration responsibility to me.

903
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:51,690
l went to the fire sale at the Baptist
Bookstore in Shreveport last week.

904
00:59:51,896 --> 00:59:55,127
They had mismatched manger scenes
at incredibly low prices.

905
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:59,360
l cleaned them out of baby Jesuses,
which l made into ornaments.

906
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:00,434
Ready to roll.

907
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,299
Shelby, would you do the honors?

908
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:09,179
-Here you are, Mrs. Latcherie.
-Thanks, Sammy.

909
01:00:09,881 --> 01:00:10,905
Ready?

910
01:00:16,254 --> 01:00:18,279
Annelle, it's wonderful!

911
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:19,751
lt works!

912
01:00:20,024 --> 01:00:22,049
How cute!

913
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,458
l think your elves have gone berserk.

914
01:00:25,963 --> 01:00:28,761
Shelby! l wasn't expecting
to see you here today.

915
01:00:28,966 --> 01:00:32,663
l'm running a special.
lt's called a ''Christmas quickie.''

916
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:36,931
l'm beyond help. l've discovered
the early stages of crow's feet.

917
01:00:37,141 --> 01:00:41,601
Time marches on, and eventually you
realize it's marching across your face.

918
01:00:41,812 --> 01:00:43,746
-Stop it.
-Oh, no.

919
01:00:44,248 --> 01:00:45,374
lt's Miss Ouiser.

920
01:00:49,787 --> 01:00:52,847
l'm supposed to give her
a pedicure today.

921
01:00:53,057 --> 01:00:54,922
l hate working on her feet.

922
01:00:55,126 --> 01:00:58,823
lt could've been worse.
She could've wanted a bikini waxing.

923
01:00:59,463 --> 01:01:02,227
-Let's not get graphic.
-Why not?

924
01:01:02,433 --> 01:01:05,061
Miss Ouiser, l met
an old friend of yours.

925
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:07,601
Owen Jenkins.

926
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:12,405
Owen! Now, there's a blast
from the past.

927
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:14,305
You remember him?
He remembers you.

928
01:01:14,512 --> 01:01:17,709
Of course. He had the longest
nose hair in the free world.

929
01:01:17,915 --> 01:01:20,941
He doesn't now.
He hardly has any hair anywhere.

930
01:01:21,152 --> 01:01:23,950
Owen's been gone from Chinquapin
since God was a boy.

931
01:01:24,155 --> 01:01:25,383
l forgot he existed.

932
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:28,258
He lives in Monroe
and goes to First Presbyterian.

933
01:01:28,659 --> 01:01:31,560
He found out where l was from
and asked if l knew you.

934
01:01:32,129 --> 01:01:33,790
He used to live in Ohio.

935
01:01:33,998 --> 01:01:37,024
His wife just died recently,
and he's moved back down here.

936
01:01:38,803 --> 01:01:40,464
Does this story have a point?

937
01:01:40,671 --> 01:01:44,402
No, not really. He just
remembers you fondly, l think.

938
01:01:44,609 --> 01:01:45,906
l can't imagine why.

939
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:49,509
He was not a bad fellow.
But l managed to run him off...

940
01:01:49,714 --> 01:01:51,944
...and marry the first
of two deadbeats.

941
01:01:52,149 --> 01:01:55,084
Maybe l could arrange for us all
to get together.

942
01:01:55,553 --> 01:01:57,612
-Maybe not.
-Why not?

943
01:01:59,023 --> 01:02:03,289
ln a few decades, l married the two
most worthless men in the universe...

944
01:02:03,494 --> 01:02:07,988
...and proceeded to have the three most
ungrateful children ever conceived.

945
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:10,393
The only reason people are
nice to me...

946
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:12,899
...is because l have
more money than God.

947
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:15,629
l'm not about to open
a new can of worms.

948
01:02:17,441 --> 01:02:18,271
What?

949
01:02:18,909 --> 01:02:21,309
lf this is how you feel,
it isn't healthy.

950
01:02:21,879 --> 01:02:25,838
Maybe you should come down to the
Guidance Center and talk to someone.

951
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:28,577
l'm not crazy, M'Lynn.

952
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:32,153
l've just been in a very bad mood
for 40 years.

953
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,426
Merry Christmas.

954
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,461
Look at you. ls that new?

955
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:44,430
l made the dress
with my own two hands.

956
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:46,762
l just threw the rest of it together.

957
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:49,769
The only thing that separates us
from the animals...

958
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:52,499
...is our ability to accessorize.

959
01:02:53,477 --> 01:02:55,240
Annelle, why are you so late?

960
01:02:55,446 --> 01:02:58,813
Did you and Sammy get tangled up
in the tinsel?

961
01:02:59,016 --> 01:03:01,348
Truvy, you kill me.

962
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:03,314
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.

963
01:03:03,521 --> 01:03:05,546
-Merry Christmas to you.
-Oh, darling.

964
01:03:05,756 --> 01:03:10,022
Your nephew Marshall is a little piece
of heaven right here on earth.

965
01:03:10,227 --> 01:03:12,923
They're family and l love them,
but they do look like...

966
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:15,564
...they've all been carved
out of cream cheese.

967
01:03:18,636 --> 01:03:22,470
Clairee, l'm surprised at you
talking about your kin that way.

968
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:24,368
As somebody always said:

969
01:03:24,575 --> 01:03:28,671
''lf you can't say anything nice
about anybody, come sit by me.''

970
01:03:28,879 --> 01:03:29,811
That's a good one.

971
01:03:35,486 --> 01:03:38,148
-Somebody wants to see you.
-Who?

972
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:40,756
l've opened the can of worms for you.

973
01:03:44,095 --> 01:03:45,323
Hell.

974
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:46,822
Owen Jenkins.

975
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:49,261
Hello, Louisa. Remember me?

976
01:03:50,434 --> 01:03:53,335
My God, you look different.
Have you shrunk?

977
01:03:55,506 --> 01:03:58,907
You look terrific.
You've hardly changed at all.

978
01:03:59,744 --> 01:04:02,235
l'm not as sweet as l used to be.

979
01:04:12,823 --> 01:04:14,950
l cannot believe Shelby did that.

980
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:16,251
Owen.

981
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,189
After all these years.

982
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,921
l'm not sure l can be
gracious under pressure.

983
01:04:21,132 --> 01:04:23,794
Shelby does a lot of things
l can't believe.

984
01:04:24,668 --> 01:04:28,399
What's wrong with you these days?
You got a reindeer up your butt?

985
01:04:28,606 --> 01:04:30,005
Everybody!

986
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:32,698
Tommy, get all these people outside.

987
01:04:36,514 --> 01:04:40,041
Quiet down. l just want
a moment of your time, folks.

988
01:04:42,353 --> 01:04:44,287
Today, my daughter...

989
01:04:44,822 --> 01:04:46,983
...told me a big secret.

990
01:04:47,558 --> 01:04:51,460
Now, don't worry, honey, l'm not
gonna tell them your pregnant.

991
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,931
l'm just gonna tell them
l'm gonna be a granddaddy.

992
01:04:57,835 --> 01:04:59,666
That's wonderful!

993
01:05:07,478 --> 01:05:09,412
-Grandma!
-Congratulations!

994
01:05:10,314 --> 01:05:11,713
Ain't you excited?

995
01:05:11,916 --> 01:05:14,851
Smile. lt increases your face value.

996
01:05:15,052 --> 01:05:17,452
The doctors said
Shelby couldn't have children.

997
01:05:17,655 --> 01:05:19,850
What do they know?
She showed them.

998
01:05:20,057 --> 01:05:23,652
The doctors said she shouldn't have
children. There's a difference.

999
01:05:24,829 --> 01:05:27,696
This baby is not exactly great news.

1000
01:05:27,898 --> 01:05:30,492
To Jackson and Shelby.

1001
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:40,471
l really wish l had some
words of wisdom, but l don't.

1002
01:05:40,678 --> 01:05:44,307
So why don't we just focus
on the joy of the situation?

1003
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:46,313
lt'll be fine.

1004
01:05:46,884 --> 01:05:48,511
Absolutely.

1005
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,115
You know what they say:

1006
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:55,554
''That which does not kill us
makes us stronger.''

1007
01:06:03,767 --> 01:06:07,259
Nothing pleases Shelby more
than proving me wrong.

1008
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:17,840
And to my new grandbaby.

1009
01:06:18,415 --> 01:06:21,509
May he be as good looking as l am.

1010
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,886
Born on the third ofJu/y

1011
01:06:33,597 --> 01:06:37,055
He's a Yankee Dood/e sweetheart

1012
01:06:37,334 --> 01:06:40,599
He's a Yankee Dood/e boy

1013
01:06:40,804 --> 01:06:43,500
Yankee Dood/e went to London
Just to ride a pony

1014
01:06:43,707 --> 01:06:46,301
He is a Yankee Dood/e boy

1015
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:48,842
Go ahead, blow it out.

1016
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:50,513
Go ahead, blow it out.

1017
01:06:52,016 --> 01:06:55,042
-This is boring.
-You only have a first birthday once.

1018
01:06:55,252 --> 01:06:58,415
-He's making a wish.
-l wish he'd blow out the candle.

1019
01:06:58,622 --> 01:07:00,146
l can't stand this.

1020
01:07:00,491 --> 01:07:02,721
Don't you dare!

1021
01:07:04,428 --> 01:07:05,793
Come on, here we go.

1022
01:07:05,996 --> 01:07:07,224
One, two, three.

1023
01:07:11,802 --> 01:07:13,429
Happy birthday!

1024
01:07:16,106 --> 01:07:19,701
l'll be back from Truvy's in about
an hour. Anything you want?

1025
01:07:20,544 --> 01:07:22,205
l think l'll come with you.

1026
01:07:22,546 --> 01:07:25,037
l wanna get my hair cut. Short.

1027
01:07:25,749 --> 01:07:27,341
And l want Truvy to do it.

1028
01:07:27,551 --> 01:07:29,018
lt's easy to take care of.

1029
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:32,052
l'd love to be able to
run my fingers through it and go.

1030
01:07:33,757 --> 01:07:35,748
l think that would be precious.

1031
01:07:37,227 --> 01:07:40,355
l feel the need to make things
as simple as possible.

1032
01:07:40,564 --> 01:07:42,156
Let me go tell Jackson.

1033
01:07:53,410 --> 01:07:55,605
l just can't seem to find the wipes.

1034
01:07:55,813 --> 01:07:57,906
They're in my bag. ls he wet?

1035
01:07:58,649 --> 01:07:59,673
He's muddy.

1036
01:07:59,883 --> 01:08:02,909
Clairee, finish about your nephew.
Get to the good stuff.

1037
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,452
Well, l have to admit...

1038
01:08:05,656 --> 01:08:08,147
...Marshall did go about it
the wrong way.

1039
01:08:08,892 --> 01:08:10,484
He marched in...

1040
01:08:10,794 --> 01:08:13,092
...and without so much
as a hello, he said:

1041
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:15,891
''Mama and Daddy, l have
something to tell you.

1042
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,900
l have a brain tumor.
l have three months to live.''

1043
01:08:20,104 --> 01:08:23,198
Naturally, Drew and Belle
became hysterical.

1044
01:08:23,407 --> 01:08:24,635
Then he said:

1045
01:08:24,842 --> 01:08:27,743
''Hey, folks, l'm only kidding.

1046
01:08:27,945 --> 01:08:29,242
l'm just gay.''

1047
01:08:29,546 --> 01:08:32,014
That was his idea
of breaking the news gently?

1048
01:08:32,216 --> 01:08:34,514
Marshall was always very theatrical.

1049
01:08:34,718 --> 01:08:37,846
l wonder what Drew and Belle must be
feeling about this.

1050
01:08:38,055 --> 01:08:40,615
l don't know.
They've considered themselves...

1051
01:08:40,824 --> 01:08:43,088
...a model family for so long.

1052
01:08:43,293 --> 01:08:47,195
First Nancy Beth dethroned
from her Miss Merry Christmas title...

1053
01:08:47,398 --> 01:08:50,333
...because of that unfortunate
motel thing.

1054
01:08:50,534 --> 01:08:53,935
What motel thing?
l don't live here anymore, remember?

1055
01:08:54,138 --> 01:08:59,007
Nancy Beth was discovered in a local
motel with a high political official.

1056
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:03,039
They were both high. They'd been
smoking everything but their shoes.

1057
01:09:03,247 --> 01:09:05,875
She's the first Miss Merry Christmas
to be caught...

1058
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:09,052
...with her tinsel
down around her knees.

1059
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,583
Speaking of drawers, hang on to yours!

1060
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:29,135
Oh, gosh.

1061
01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:31,102
You don't like it.

1062
01:09:31,608 --> 01:09:33,371
l did what you asked me, didn't l?

1063
01:09:33,577 --> 01:09:35,704
Yes, you really did a beautiful job.

1064
01:09:37,481 --> 01:09:38,778
lt's just that....

1065
01:09:40,684 --> 01:09:42,208
Sweetheart, don't.

1066
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:44,282
Please don't cry or l will too.

1067
01:09:44,488 --> 01:09:48,754
l have a strict policy that nobody
cries alone in my presence.

1068
01:09:49,693 --> 01:09:50,717
l love it.

1069
01:10:05,809 --> 01:10:07,401
Let's do my nails.

1070
01:10:07,678 --> 01:10:11,307
This is a treat! Nobody around here
ever wants a manicure.

1071
01:10:11,515 --> 01:10:15,315
l don't think l'd even know what
to charge for a full day's beauty.

1072
01:10:15,519 --> 01:10:17,214
l'm gonna need one too.

1073
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:22,358
l am gonna paint my front door red
and change my name to Elizabeth Arden.

1074
01:10:24,161 --> 01:10:25,526
Amen.

1075
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,197
Amen.

1076
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:31,628
l'm gonna need some more
cuticle oil.

1077
01:10:31,835 --> 01:10:34,133
-ls it still next to--?
-Second shelf.

1078
01:10:35,839 --> 01:10:37,602
-Was she praying?
-Yes.

1079
01:10:37,808 --> 01:10:39,332
-Why?
-Got me.

1080
01:10:39,543 --> 01:10:42,273
Maybe she was praying for Marshall
and Drew and Belle.

1081
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:44,743
Maybe she was praying
because we were gossiping.

1082
01:10:44,948 --> 01:10:48,315
Maybe she was praying because
the elastic is shot in her pantyhose.

1083
01:10:48,519 --> 01:10:51,147
Who knows? She prays at
the drop of a hat these days.

1084
01:10:51,355 --> 01:10:52,686
How long has she been this way?

1085
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:53,857
Since Mardi Gras.

1086
01:10:54,057 --> 01:10:57,823
She had a choice of going to a
Bible weekend with her Sunday school...

1087
01:10:58,028 --> 01:11:00,758
...or to New Orleans with me
and two other sinners.

1088
01:11:00,964 --> 01:11:02,431
What's her boyfriend say?

1089
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:03,930
Sammy's so confused...

1090
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:06,864
...he don't know to
scratch his watch or wind his butt.

1091
01:11:07,704 --> 01:11:10,605
He could deal with another man,
but he's having trouble...

1092
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:13,834
...with the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

1093
01:11:17,714 --> 01:11:21,115
Well, does Marshall have,
you know, friends?

1094
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:23,013
We discussed that.

1095
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:25,313
l asked him how he...

1096
01:11:25,522 --> 01:11:27,012
...met people.

1097
01:11:27,457 --> 01:11:31,757
ln my day, a man's demeanor told
which side his bread was buttered on.

1098
01:11:31,962 --> 01:11:34,430
But in this day and age, who knows?

1099
01:11:34,631 --> 01:11:37,964
l asked Marshall, ''How can you tell?''

1100
01:11:38,202 --> 01:11:42,036
And he said, ''All gay men
have track lighting.

1101
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:45,868
And all gay men are named
Mark, Rick or Steve.''

1102
01:11:46,376 --> 01:11:48,936
Be a soft-spoken dog!

1103
01:11:49,279 --> 01:11:50,507
Morning.

1104
01:11:51,114 --> 01:11:52,240
What's so funny?

1105
01:11:52,449 --> 01:11:56,442
Clairee's just been telling us
this true story of track lighting.

1106
01:11:56,653 --> 01:11:57,984
l love mine.

1107
01:11:59,122 --> 01:12:01,352
Highlights my new artwork.

1108
01:12:01,725 --> 01:12:04,216
Since when do you have track lighting?

1109
01:12:05,028 --> 01:12:08,657
About three weeks. lt's in
the foyer up the staircase.

1110
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:10,891
My grandson's idea.

1111
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:13,233
l haven't seen him in ages.

1112
01:12:13,437 --> 01:12:14,563
How is he?

1113
01:12:14,771 --> 01:12:15,738
Steve's fine.

1114
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:21,368
Oh, God.

1115
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:23,577
Your hair is so short.

1116
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:26,647
You're almost chipper.
Why are you in such a good mood?

1117
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:28,909
Did you run over a small child?

1118
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:29,949
Tomatoes.

1119
01:12:30,153 --> 01:12:31,745
Don't give all these to me.

1120
01:12:31,955 --> 01:12:33,513
Somebody's gotta take them.

1121
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:37,421
l try not to eat healthy food
if l can possibly help it.

1122
01:12:37,628 --> 01:12:40,722
The sooner my body gives out,
the better off l'll be.

1123
01:12:41,098 --> 01:12:43,328
l can't get enough grease
into my diet.

1124
01:12:43,533 --> 01:12:45,364
Then why do you grow them?

1125
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:47,662
Southern women are supposed to wear...

1126
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:51,830
...funny-looking hats and ugly clothes
and grow vegetables in the dirt.

1127
01:12:54,811 --> 01:12:57,541
Don't ask me those questions.
l don't know why.

1128
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:59,613
l don't make the rules.

1129
01:13:03,287 --> 01:13:05,118
Now, that's attractive, Ouiser.

1130
01:13:12,562 --> 01:13:14,962
Honey, what have you done to yourself?

1131
01:13:15,165 --> 01:13:16,792
lt doesn't hurt.

1132
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,730
M'Lynn, have you seen this?

1133
01:13:22,039 --> 01:13:23,870
Yes, l have.

1134
01:13:24,808 --> 01:13:28,539
The doctor's strengthening my veins.
They're in terrible shape.

1135
01:13:28,745 --> 01:13:29,905
My God!

1136
01:13:30,113 --> 01:13:33,605
lt looks like you been
driving nails up your arms.

1137
01:13:34,217 --> 01:13:35,809
What is going on?

1138
01:13:36,987 --> 01:13:38,284
Shall we tell them?

1139
01:13:43,193 --> 01:13:46,162
l guess we can't keep it
a secret any longer.

1140
01:13:47,364 --> 01:13:49,764
Shelby has been driving nails
up her arm.

1141
01:13:51,902 --> 01:13:55,099
lt's my dialysis. lt's no big thing.

1142
01:13:57,908 --> 01:14:01,674
Don't look at me like that.
Having Jack, Jr., strained my kidneys...

1143
01:14:01,878 --> 01:14:03,846
...and now they're kaput, that's all.

1144
01:14:04,047 --> 01:14:06,777
The doctor said this would
probably happen.

1145
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:08,451
''That's all''?

1146
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:10,643
''That's all,'' she says.

1147
01:14:10,854 --> 01:14:13,652
Do you do this dialysis forever?

1148
01:14:13,857 --> 01:14:15,654
Well, l could, l suppose.

1149
01:14:16,059 --> 01:14:18,892
But it's not convenient
when keeping up with Jack, Jr.

1150
01:14:19,096 --> 01:14:21,462
So l'll have a kidney transplant.
l'll be fine.

1151
01:14:21,865 --> 01:14:23,799
-ls it that easy?
-Sure.

1152
01:14:24,067 --> 01:14:26,695
They do them all the time
in Shreveport.

1153
01:14:26,903 --> 01:14:31,067
They do. Our Sunday school class was
just praying for one the other day.

1154
01:14:31,274 --> 01:14:34,300
But the hard part is
finding a kidney, isn't it?

1155
01:14:34,544 --> 01:14:38,412
l saw something about it on TV.
Very dramatic.

1156
01:14:38,615 --> 01:14:42,312
Medical teams fly all over the place
taking hearts and kidneys...

1157
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:43,918
...and who knows what else.

1158
01:14:44,121 --> 01:14:45,679
You know what impressed me?

1159
01:14:45,889 --> 01:14:49,450
-They carry the organs in beer coolers.
-Stop it!

1160
01:14:49,659 --> 01:14:51,923
Those doctors take out
their six-packs...

1161
01:14:52,129 --> 01:14:55,257
...throw in some dry ice
and a heart and get on a plane.

1162
01:14:55,665 --> 01:14:57,826
How long do you have to wait for one?

1163
01:14:58,335 --> 01:15:01,327
There are people on dialysis
that have waited for years.

1164
01:15:02,472 --> 01:15:04,099
That must be agony.

1165
01:15:04,508 --> 01:15:06,271
l suppose, but...

1166
01:15:06,643 --> 01:15:08,770
...l'm lucky.
l don't have to wait anymore.

1167
01:15:11,148 --> 01:15:13,173
Mama's gonna give me
one of her kidneys.

1168
01:15:15,919 --> 01:15:16,908
When?

1169
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,020
We check in tomorrow morning.

1170
01:15:28,632 --> 01:15:30,862
So you better get going on my nails.

1171
01:15:31,635 --> 01:15:34,069
-Annelle, l'm dripping.
-l'm sorry.

1172
01:15:36,506 --> 01:15:38,269
l shouldn't have said that.

1173
01:15:38,542 --> 01:15:39,941
Said what?

1174
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:41,875
Back at Truvy's.

1175
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:45,446
l said l'd be better off
when my body wears out.

1176
01:15:45,849 --> 01:15:48,443
l shouldn't have said that
in front of Shelby.

1177
01:15:48,652 --> 01:15:50,210
And l didn't mean that.

1178
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:53,355
Ouiser, nobody pays
any attention to you.

1179
01:15:54,825 --> 01:15:56,884
But l feel bad, Clairee.

1180
01:15:57,627 --> 01:15:59,561
l'm a terrible person.

1181
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:01,394
No, you're not.

1182
01:16:02,365 --> 01:16:05,334
You'd give your dog a kidney
if he needed one.

1183
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:18,706
This is just a gesture.

1184
01:16:18,915 --> 01:16:21,247
We're not feeding Drum
till the end of time.

1185
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:24,614
Drum loves pork and beans.
He eats them with everything.

1186
01:16:25,856 --> 01:16:27,790
That explains a lot.

1187
01:16:28,758 --> 01:16:32,125
You're supposed to soak
the red beans overnight.

1188
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:34,927
But we don't have overnight.

1189
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:38,260
l wanna take it to them before
they leave for the hospital.

1190
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:40,333
Let's cook something else.

1191
01:16:40,537 --> 01:16:41,868
l already bought the stuff.

1192
01:16:42,072 --> 01:16:44,540
lt's in the ''Freezes Beautifully''
section of my cookbook.

1193
01:16:44,741 --> 01:16:47,301
l wanna take something
that freezes beautifully.

1194
01:16:47,511 --> 01:16:49,979
Then we'll make red beans and rice.

1195
01:16:54,217 --> 01:16:57,709
Sammy Dwayne Desoto,
what is this in my Frigidaire?

1196
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:00,581
Beer.

1197
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,560
l don't care what you do
in your refrigerator...

1198
01:17:05,762 --> 01:17:07,787
...but you won't keep liquor in mine.

1199
01:17:10,734 --> 01:17:13,362
Annelle, for Christ's sakes.

1200
01:17:14,104 --> 01:17:15,230
Who?

1201
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:17,337
Christ.

1202
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:19,967
Who did you say?

1203
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:22,077
Christ, Christ, Christ.

1204
01:17:22,345 --> 01:17:26,145
Are you speaking of our Lord? ls that
whose name you're taking in vain?

1205
01:17:26,349 --> 01:17:27,782
That's the one.

1206
01:17:28,818 --> 01:17:32,754
l am sorry, Sammy, but l won't
spend the next 50 years of my life...

1207
01:17:32,956 --> 01:17:35,789
...with someone who l won't
run into in the hereafter.

1208
01:17:35,992 --> 01:17:37,857
Annelle, goddamn it.

1209
01:17:38,228 --> 01:17:40,093
l think we should pray.

1210
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:43,124
l'd rather eat dirt.

1211
01:17:45,335 --> 01:17:48,202
Shelby says her half
of the operation's easy.

1212
01:17:48,405 --> 01:17:50,032
l guess M'Lynn's is terrible.

1213
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,440
They basically have to saw her in half
to get the kidney out.

1214
01:17:54,744 --> 01:17:57,679
They do it on Circus of the Stars
all the time.

1215
01:17:57,881 --> 01:18:00,611
Don't joke about it, Spud.

1216
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:02,841
l feel awful for them.

1217
01:18:07,557 --> 01:18:09,582
l guess the Eatenton's are lucky.

1218
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,688
They all know how much they mean
to each other.

1219
01:18:14,397 --> 01:18:15,796
Maybe l'm jealous.

1220
01:18:15,999 --> 01:18:18,229
Hand me that socket wrench, would you?

1221
01:18:18,435 --> 01:18:21,598
-Which one's a socket wrench?
-The socket wrench.

1222
01:18:21,805 --> 01:18:23,636
This funny-looking thing?

1223
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:25,271
Thank you.

1224
01:18:33,984 --> 01:18:35,246
That's not funny.

1225
01:18:35,452 --> 01:18:38,615
Okay, no more transplant jokes.
Daddy doesn't like them.

1226
01:18:38,822 --> 01:18:40,449
Whose turn is it?

1227
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:43,657
Mama, give me all your...

1228
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:45,691
...internal organs.

1229
01:18:46,696 --> 01:18:48,186
l mean aces.

1230
01:18:49,299 --> 01:18:50,994
Dad, l'm sorry.

1231
01:18:51,201 --> 01:18:52,327
lt just slipped out.

1232
01:18:52,535 --> 01:18:54,025
Go fish.

1233
01:18:55,038 --> 01:18:56,665
l'll put this little one to bed.

1234
01:18:56,873 --> 01:18:59,501
-Mama, l'll do it.
-No, no, let me.

1235
01:18:59,776 --> 01:19:02,973
After tomorrow, it'll be a long time
before l can pick him up.

1236
01:19:03,179 --> 01:19:04,806
So much for the card game.

1237
01:19:05,015 --> 01:19:06,277
Movie!

1238
01:19:06,583 --> 01:19:08,278
Yes! Old and black-and-white.

1239
01:19:08,485 --> 01:19:09,452
Nothing dirty there.

1240
01:19:09,653 --> 01:19:10,984
l got it. A classic.

1241
01:19:11,187 --> 01:19:13,155
''A Tale of Two Kidneys.''

1242
01:19:16,059 --> 01:19:17,617
You think that's funny?

1243
01:19:18,928 --> 01:19:20,418
That's not funny.

1244
01:19:22,365 --> 01:19:25,300
l overslept because l was
up late cooking.

1245
01:19:25,502 --> 01:19:27,936
l've gotta get these beans
to the Eatenton's...

1246
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:30,572
...and it's my Sunday
to count the offering...

1247
01:19:30,774 --> 01:19:33,038
...and l just know
l'm gonna miss church.

1248
01:19:33,243 --> 01:19:36,303
Cool down. l'm gonna have to
turn the hose on you.

1249
01:19:36,513 --> 01:19:38,208
l just don't know what l'll do.

1250
01:19:38,415 --> 01:19:40,042
l know what you're gonna do.

1251
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:42,184
You are gonna get in this car...

1252
01:19:42,385 --> 01:19:46,082
...and we're gonna drop that pot
of beans off at the Eatenton house.

1253
01:19:46,756 --> 01:19:48,781
Then you are going to church with me.

1254
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:50,857
l don't know.

1255
01:19:51,061 --> 01:19:54,929
Honey, God don't care which church
you go to, as long as you show up.

1256
01:20:37,807 --> 01:20:41,299
-Ouiser, what brings you here?
-Shut up.

1257
01:20:41,511 --> 01:20:45,038
l was just wondering how things were
with you and Owen.

1258
01:20:46,049 --> 01:20:49,485
l can report that the Sherwood Florist
delivery truck...

1259
01:20:49,686 --> 01:20:52,519
...stops by her house
at least twice a week.

1260
01:20:52,989 --> 01:20:54,786
He knows l like fresh flowers.

1261
01:20:54,991 --> 01:20:57,721
And l can report that a strange car...

1262
01:20:57,927 --> 01:21:01,260
...is parked in her garage
at least once a week.

1263
01:21:02,432 --> 01:21:03,330
There.

1264
01:21:03,533 --> 01:21:05,023
My secret is out.

1265
01:21:05,235 --> 01:21:08,602
l am having an affair
with a Mercedes-Benz.

1266
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:12,037
We are in the house of the Lord.

1267
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:13,607
Oh, like she cares.

1268
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:16,973
Ouiser's never done
a religious thing in her life.

1269
01:21:17,847 --> 01:21:19,371
Now, that is not true.

1270
01:21:19,582 --> 01:21:22,346
When l was in school,
a bunch of my friends and l...

1271
01:21:22,552 --> 01:21:25,453
...would dress up as nuns
and go bar-hopping.

1272
01:21:27,524 --> 01:21:30,857
Ouiser, forgive me, but l just been
dying to ask you this.

1273
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:33,119
Are you and Owen, you know...?

1274
01:21:34,097 --> 01:21:37,624
Wait, wait. l have to get
a mental picture of this.

1275
01:21:38,668 --> 01:21:41,865
A dirty mind is a terrible thing
to waste.

1276
01:21:42,806 --> 01:21:45,775
Not that this is any
of anyone else's business...

1277
01:21:45,975 --> 01:21:47,943
...but no. We're friends.

1278
01:21:48,144 --> 01:21:50,942
He would like more,
and l am dealing with that.

1279
01:21:51,147 --> 01:21:52,978
But l am old and set in my ways.

1280
01:21:53,183 --> 01:21:55,344
You are playing hard to get.

1281
01:21:55,552 --> 01:21:58,419
At her age, she should be playing
beat the clock.

1282
01:21:59,823 --> 01:22:03,259
-Miss DeLord, is 240 on telemetry?
-Yes, he is.

1283
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:04,484
Thank you.

1284
01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:08,764
May l help you?

1285
01:22:08,965 --> 01:22:11,058
Cou/d somebody fix my /V, p/ease?

1286
01:22:11,267 --> 01:22:13,292
Someone'll be there in a minute.

1287
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:16,868
Wendy, will you check 240's lV?

1288
01:22:58,381 --> 01:23:02,818
l think that despite everything,
we have a very good result.

1289
01:23:07,757 --> 01:23:11,090
Looks good. Looks real, real good.

1290
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:15,759
Thanks.

1291
01:23:35,919 --> 01:23:37,409
Surprise!

1292
01:23:40,089 --> 01:23:41,283
l can't believe this!

1293
01:23:41,491 --> 01:23:45,222
l have always wanted to give
a wedding shower with a monster motif.

1294
01:23:45,428 --> 01:23:48,295
That's what you get
for getting married on Halloween.

1295
01:23:49,299 --> 01:23:50,197
My heart!

1296
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,129
Come on, let's open the gifts.

1297
01:23:52,535 --> 01:23:53,934
You're welcome. Next.

1298
01:23:54,137 --> 01:23:56,833
M'Lynn, appliqu....

1299
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,873
With some little fringe on them
and some appliqu.

1300
01:24:00,076 --> 01:24:01,509
Quiet down. Quiet down.

1301
01:24:01,711 --> 01:24:04,578
lt says, ''Better late than never.''

1302
01:24:06,182 --> 01:24:08,047
Look out, Sammy!

1303
01:24:09,152 --> 01:24:11,017
-Who's that from?
-lt's not signed.

1304
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:12,448
Here, let me see.

1305
01:24:15,491 --> 01:24:16,549
What?

1306
01:24:16,993 --> 01:24:19,518
l'd recognize
this penmanship anywhere.

1307
01:24:19,729 --> 01:24:22,220
You have the handwriting
of a serial killer.

1308
01:24:22,899 --> 01:24:26,335
l just thought Sammy wouldn't mind
you reading the Bible in bed...

1309
01:24:26,536 --> 01:24:29,061
...if you were wearing
something inspirational.

1310
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:30,170
Yuck, yuck.

1311
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,701
Put down ''split crotch.''

1312
01:24:32,909 --> 01:24:35,343
-This is from Shelby.
-That's disgusting.

1313
01:24:35,545 --> 01:24:38,309
She's sorry she couldn't be here.
She's on duty.

1314
01:24:38,514 --> 01:24:40,414
-How is she?
-Fine.

1315
01:24:40,683 --> 01:24:43,618
l fed baby Renz,
but l haven't fed Alex, okay?

1316
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:46,721
-Gotta get home for Halloween.
-Have a good evening.

1317
01:24:48,091 --> 01:24:50,992
This is too cute.
Now, where did you find it?

1318
01:24:51,194 --> 01:24:54,527
Aunt Fern made it. l can't wait
to get home and try it on Jack.

1319
01:24:54,731 --> 01:24:57,928
l even taught him to say,
''trick or treat,'' or something--

1320
01:24:59,502 --> 01:25:01,367
Something kind of like it.

1321
01:25:02,271 --> 01:25:04,364
Could you hand me that bag, Pam?

1322
01:25:08,678 --> 01:25:09,736
-Thanks.
-Good night.

1323
01:25:09,946 --> 01:25:11,004
Good night.

1324
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:15,974
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1325
01:25:16,185 --> 01:25:18,346
lf this don't work on my husband,
come back.

1326
01:25:18,554 --> 01:25:20,579
-Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
-See you.

1327
01:25:21,758 --> 01:25:24,625
Looks like somebody's husband's
coming home tonight.

1328
01:25:24,827 --> 01:25:27,762
When you work a seven-day stretch
on an oil rig...

1329
01:25:27,964 --> 01:25:30,330
...all you wanna do
on your day off is sleep.

1330
01:25:30,533 --> 01:25:33,866
But l'm gonna do everything l can
to keep him up.

1331
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:36,504
Anne Boleyn had six fingers.

1332
01:25:36,906 --> 01:25:38,203
Who's Anne Berlin?

1333
01:25:38,908 --> 01:25:42,742
Anne Boleyn. She was one
of the six wives of Henry Vlll.

1334
01:25:43,546 --> 01:25:45,673
l never watch public television.

1335
01:25:45,882 --> 01:25:48,350
She had six fingers.

1336
01:25:48,751 --> 01:25:50,844
What happened to the other four?

1337
01:25:51,054 --> 01:25:53,887
She had 1 1 total.

1338
01:25:54,090 --> 01:25:56,251
Are you trying to confuse me?

1339
01:25:56,459 --> 01:25:59,656
No. l just want to expose us...

1340
01:25:59,862 --> 01:26:01,659
...to a little more culture.

1341
01:26:01,864 --> 01:26:05,356
And that's not easy to come by
in this neck of the woods.

1342
01:26:07,003 --> 01:26:10,495
How about taking a theater trip
to New York?

1343
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:13,140
l don't wanna expose myself
to anything.

1344
01:26:13,342 --> 01:26:14,866
Broaden your horizons.

1345
01:26:15,078 --> 01:26:19,481
You broaden your horizons your way,
and l will broaden my horizons mine.

1346
01:26:19,682 --> 01:26:21,912
l'm gonna support the arts
in this area.

1347
01:26:22,118 --> 01:26:25,212
l'll write a check. l support art.
l don't have to see it.

1348
01:26:25,421 --> 01:26:27,446
lt wouldn't harelip you.

1349
01:26:27,957 --> 01:26:30,755
Can l get one thing straight with you?

1350
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:35,192
l do not see plays,
because l can nap at home for free.

1351
01:26:35,665 --> 01:26:39,965
l don't see movies, because they're
trash and got naked people in them.

1352
01:26:40,169 --> 01:26:43,730
l don't read books, because
they'll make them into a miniseries.

1353
01:26:44,173 --> 01:26:48,473
You would be a much more contented,
pleasant person...

1354
01:26:48,678 --> 01:26:51,806
...if you would find ways
to occupy your time.

1355
01:26:52,014 --> 01:26:53,538
l am pleasant!

1356
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:56,913
Damn it! l just saw Drum Eatenton
at the Piggly-Wiggly...

1357
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:01,181
...and l smiled at the son of a bitch
before l could help myself!

1358
01:27:06,395 --> 01:27:07,726
l'm sorry, Miss Ouiser.

1359
01:27:07,930 --> 01:27:11,627
You take your Bible and shove it
where the sun doesn't shine.

1360
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:16,265
Put it in Mommy's pocket.

1361
01:27:16,472 --> 01:27:17,803
There we go.

1362
01:27:18,141 --> 01:27:21,872
We'll zip you up, and we'll go
trick-or-treating right after dinner.

1363
01:27:22,078 --> 01:27:24,239
Let's go in and make some spaghetti.

1364
01:27:41,497 --> 01:27:44,057
Let's go call Daddy, okay?

1365
01:27:50,072 --> 01:27:51,596
Darling, l'm home.

1366
01:27:58,948 --> 01:28:00,609
What's the matter, pal?

1367
01:28:01,717 --> 01:28:02,741
What?

1368
01:28:05,087 --> 01:28:06,554
What's the matter?

1369
01:28:13,863 --> 01:28:15,888
Okay, buddy.

1370
01:28:18,935 --> 01:28:19,765
Oh, my God.

1371
01:28:19,969 --> 01:28:22,028
Okay, baby, just wait right here.

1372
01:28:23,539 --> 01:28:24,938
Shelby? Baby?

1373
01:28:51,834 --> 01:28:53,802
--rejection of the kidney....

1374
01:29:05,114 --> 01:29:07,275
The coma may be irreversible.

1375
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:46,847
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Gladys.

1376
01:29:47,156 --> 01:29:48,919
We're doing our Jane Fonda.

1377
01:29:49,125 --> 01:29:51,525
The exercises are good for her.

1378
01:29:53,796 --> 01:29:56,060
Here's the one where
you're holding him.

1379
01:29:56,832 --> 01:29:58,891
You're looking at him,
he's looking at you...

1380
01:29:59,101 --> 01:30:01,626
...and then you all looked over at me.
Remember?

1381
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:05,934
Open your eyes, Shelby.
Open your eyes. Look at him.

1382
01:30:06,642 --> 01:30:11,102
He wants you to open your eyes, Shelby.
He wants you to open your eyes.

1383
01:30:57,593 --> 01:30:59,083
''Lesson Three:

1384
01:30:59,962 --> 01:31:01,793
Never be afraid...

1385
01:31:02,064 --> 01:31:04,658
...to try a brave new look.

1386
01:31:05,501 --> 01:31:07,799
Now, that could mean wearing...

1387
01:31:08,237 --> 01:31:09,898
...daring to wear...

1388
01:31:11,707 --> 01:31:15,575
...a sexy slip of a dress
that bares--''

1389
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:23,812
Honey, it'll do you good
to get out for a while.

1390
01:31:24,453 --> 01:31:26,011
Eat a real dinner.

1391
01:31:30,893 --> 01:31:33,862
What if she wakes up for two minutes
and l'm not here?

1392
01:31:38,267 --> 01:31:39,894
''For example...

1393
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:43,864
...we know where you can get
a top-of-the-line hairstyle--''

1394
01:33:58,908 --> 01:34:00,535
Call Clairee.

1395
01:34:02,545 --> 01:34:05,480
Call Connolly's Funeral Home.
lt's the nicest.

1396
01:34:15,724 --> 01:34:18,022
You're gonna have to get
her pink suit.

1397
01:34:19,562 --> 01:34:22,554
The one with the little red cherries
on the lapel.

1398
01:34:25,901 --> 01:34:27,493
Where's Jack, Jr.?

1399
01:34:28,237 --> 01:34:29,704
Aunt Fern's.

1400
01:35:15,684 --> 01:35:16,708
There's your grandma.

1401
01:35:30,399 --> 01:35:31,627
Pumpkin.

1402
01:36:02,298 --> 01:36:04,823
Does this tie go?

1403
01:36:11,874 --> 01:36:13,705
You look real nice.

1404
01:36:14,943 --> 01:36:17,605
Thought l'd come to the funeral,
if you don't mind.

1405
01:36:18,981 --> 01:36:20,312
l don't mind.

l feel sorry for them, you know?

1407
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:39,700
l mean, especially Jackson.

1408
01:36:42,104 --> 01:36:44,265
Losing Shelby like that.

1409
01:36:49,144 --> 01:36:51,009
lf that ever happened to me...

1410
01:36:53,949 --> 01:36:55,712
...l don't know what l'd do.

1411
01:37:01,890 --> 01:37:05,417
A thing like this just
doesn't make any sense.

1412
01:37:06,595 --> 01:37:08,392
No sense at all.

1413
01:37:09,598 --> 01:37:11,828
l just think about what Annelle says:

1414
01:37:12,301 --> 01:37:15,327
''The Lord works in mysterious ways.''

1415
01:37:16,905 --> 01:37:18,566
What the hell's this for?

1416
01:37:20,676 --> 01:37:21,836
lt makes you pretty.

1417
01:39:20,429 --> 01:39:22,192
Come on home, honey.

1418
01:39:39,414 --> 01:39:41,439
How you holding up, honey?

1419
01:39:44,386 --> 01:39:45,683
l'm fine.

1420
01:39:47,222 --> 01:39:49,782
lt was a beautiful service.

1421
01:39:49,992 --> 01:39:54,224
The flowers were the most
beautiful flowers l have ever seen.

1422
01:39:54,897 --> 01:39:56,387
They were beautiful.

1423
01:40:02,404 --> 01:40:06,500
lt should make you feel a lot better
that Shelby is with her King.

1424
01:40:09,077 --> 01:40:11,068
Yes, Annelle, l guess it should.

1425
01:40:12,214 --> 01:40:15,411
-We should all be rejoicing.
-Well, you go on ahead.

1426
01:40:15,684 --> 01:40:18,585
l'm sorry if l don't feel like it.
l guess l'm selfish.

1427
01:40:18,787 --> 01:40:20,652
l'd rather have her here.

1428
01:40:26,495 --> 01:40:29,589
l don't mean to upset you
by saying that.

1429
01:40:31,366 --> 01:40:32,924
lt's just that...

1430
01:40:34,403 --> 01:40:37,133
...when something like this happens...

1431
01:40:37,639 --> 01:40:41,268
...l pray very hard to make
heads or tails of it.

1432
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:44,504
And l think that in Shelby's case...

1433
01:40:44,713 --> 01:40:48,171
...she just wanted to take care
of that little baby...

1434
01:40:48,383 --> 01:40:51,784
...and of you, of everybody she knew.

1435
01:40:52,287 --> 01:40:55,279
And her poor little body was
just worn out.

1436
01:40:56,091 --> 01:41:00,289
lt just wouldn't let her do
all the things she wanted to.

1437
01:41:00,829 --> 01:41:04,128
So she went on to a place
where she could be...

1438
01:41:04,333 --> 01:41:06,392
...a guardian angel.

1439
01:41:07,369 --> 01:41:09,462
She will always be young.

1440
01:41:09,671 --> 01:41:12,003
She will always be beautiful.

1441
01:41:12,741 --> 01:41:17,440
And l personally feel much safer
knowing that she's up there on my side.

1442
01:41:20,082 --> 01:41:23,574
lt may sound real simple
and stupid and....

1443
01:41:24,553 --> 01:41:25,918
Well, maybe l am...

1444
01:41:26,121 --> 01:41:29,022
...but that's how l get through
things like this.

1445
01:41:33,462 --> 01:41:35,054
Thank you, Annelle.

1446
01:41:40,002 --> 01:41:41,560
l appreciate that.

1447
01:41:43,472 --> 01:41:45,667
And it's a real good idea.

1448
01:41:46,842 --> 01:41:50,835
Shelby wouldn't want us
to get mired down and wallow in this.

1449
01:41:51,046 --> 01:41:54,140
We should handle it
the way best way we know how...

1450
01:41:54,349 --> 01:41:55,782
...and get on with it.

1451
01:41:56,952 --> 01:41:59,011
That's what my mind says.

1452
01:42:01,089 --> 01:42:03,250
l wish somebody'd explain it
to my heart.

1453
01:42:04,426 --> 01:42:07,020
Drum says you never left her side
for a second.

1454
01:42:10,065 --> 01:42:12,260
l couldn't leave my Shelby.

1455
01:42:13,068 --> 01:42:14,365
l just sat there...

1456
01:42:14,569 --> 01:42:18,767
...and kept on pushing the way l always
have where Shelby was concerned.

1457
01:42:20,375 --> 01:42:23,003
l was hoping she'd sit up
and argue with me.

1458
01:42:25,347 --> 01:42:28,214
And finally we realized
there was no hope.

1459
01:42:31,019 --> 01:42:32,486
We turned off the machines.

1460
01:42:34,556 --> 01:42:36,786
Drum left. He couldn't take it.

1461
01:42:37,659 --> 01:42:39,058
Jackson left.

1462
01:42:42,464 --> 01:42:44,193
l find it amusing.

1463
01:42:45,033 --> 01:42:48,025
Men are supposed to be made out of
steel or something.

1464
01:42:51,239 --> 01:42:52,968
But l just sat there.

1465
01:42:55,177 --> 01:42:57,372
l just held Shelby's hand.

1466
01:43:00,515 --> 01:43:02,244
There was no noise.

1467
01:43:03,552 --> 01:43:04,917
No tremble.

1468
01:43:06,021 --> 01:43:08,114
Just peace.

1469
01:43:11,293 --> 01:43:12,817
Oh, God.

1470
01:43:13,929 --> 01:43:15,191
l realize...

1471
01:43:15,697 --> 01:43:18,188
...as a woman, how lucky l am.

1472
01:43:19,568 --> 01:43:24,505
l was there when that wonderful
creature drifted into my life.

1473
01:43:25,273 --> 01:43:27,764
And l was there when she drifted out.

1474
01:43:27,976 --> 01:43:31,139
lt was the most precious moment
of my life.

1475
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:40,051
l gotta get back.

1476
01:43:40,789 --> 01:43:42,313
Has anybody got a mirror?

1477
01:43:42,524 --> 01:43:44,617
Does anybody have a mirror?

1478
01:43:45,961 --> 01:43:48,623
l don't know how you're doing
on the inside...

1479
01:43:48,830 --> 01:43:51,298
...but your hair's just
holding up beautiful.

1480
01:43:55,737 --> 01:43:57,568
Shelby was right.

1481
01:44:00,142 --> 01:44:02,269
This is a brown football helmet.

1482
01:44:03,178 --> 01:44:04,372
Honey, are you okay?

1483
01:44:04,579 --> 01:44:05,705
l'm fine.

1484
01:44:05,914 --> 01:44:08,075
l'm fine. l'm fine.

1485
01:44:08,383 --> 01:44:09,873
l'm fine!

1486
01:44:12,354 --> 01:44:14,845
l could jog all the way
to Texas and back...

1487
01:44:15,390 --> 01:44:17,858
...but my daughter can't.

1488
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:20,089
She never could.

1489
01:44:20,295 --> 01:44:23,423
God! l'm so mad,
l don't know what to do!

1490
01:44:23,632 --> 01:44:24,656
l wanna know why.

1491
01:44:24,866 --> 01:44:27,699
l wanna know why
Shelby's life is over.

1492
01:44:27,903 --> 01:44:32,237
l wanna know how that baby will ever
know how wonderful his mother was.

1493
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:35,841
Will he ever know what she
went through for him?

1494
01:44:36,044 --> 01:44:38,842
Oh, God, l wanna know why!

1495
01:44:39,047 --> 01:44:40,514
Why?!

1496
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:44,083
Lord, l wish l could understand.

1497
01:44:47,389 --> 01:44:49,016
lt's not supposed to happen this way.

1498
01:44:49,224 --> 01:44:52,216
l'm supposed to go first.
l've always been ready to go.

1499
01:44:53,628 --> 01:44:55,289
l don't think l can take this.

1500
01:44:55,497 --> 01:44:57,260
l don't think l can take this.

1501
01:44:57,465 --> 01:45:00,457
l just wanna hit somebody
till they feel as bad as l do.

1502
01:45:00,669 --> 01:45:03,729
l just wanna hit something.
l wanna hit it hard!

1503
01:45:05,173 --> 01:45:06,140
Here.

1504
01:45:06,775 --> 01:45:07,969
Hit this.

1505
01:45:08,577 --> 01:45:10,477
Go ahead. Slap her!

1506
01:45:10,745 --> 01:45:12,542
-Are you crazy?
-Hit her!

1507
01:45:12,747 --> 01:45:15,773
-Are you high, Clairee?
-Have you lost your mind?

1508
01:45:15,984 --> 01:45:19,886
We'll sell T-shirts saying,
''l Slapped Ouiser Boudreaux''!

1509
01:45:20,088 --> 01:45:20,986
Hit her!

1510
01:45:21,189 --> 01:45:22,622
Miss Clairee, enough.

1511
01:45:22,924 --> 01:45:27,384
Ouiser, this is your chance to do
something for your fellow man.

1512
01:45:27,696 --> 01:45:28,890
Knock her lights out!

1513
01:45:29,097 --> 01:45:30,826
Let go of me!

1514
01:45:31,166 --> 01:45:34,897
You missed the chance of a lifetime.
Half of Chinquapin would give...

1515
01:45:35,103 --> 01:45:37,628
...their eyeteeth
to take a whack at Ouiser.

1516
01:45:47,616 --> 01:45:49,641
You are a pig from hell!

1517
01:45:54,256 --> 01:45:55,951
Ouiser, don't leave!

1518
01:45:56,725 --> 01:45:58,818
l was just kidding. Come back!

1519
01:46:03,598 --> 01:46:05,862
That was not a very
Christian thing to do.

1520
01:46:06,067 --> 01:46:08,399
Annelle, you gotta lighten up.

1521
01:46:46,274 --> 01:46:47,366
Go away.

1522
01:46:47,575 --> 01:46:50,840
Okay, all right. Hit me, then.
l deserve it.

1523
01:46:51,046 --> 01:46:53,310
You are evil,
and you must be destroyed.

1524
01:46:53,515 --> 01:46:56,712
Mother Nature's taking care of that
faster than you could.

1525
01:46:56,918 --> 01:46:59,853
Things were getting entirely
too serious for a moment.

1526
01:47:00,055 --> 01:47:01,522
We needed to laugh.

1527
01:47:03,458 --> 01:47:06,086
l bet Lloyd got a kick out of it.

1528
01:47:06,761 --> 01:47:11,255
Lloyd got a great deal of enjoyment
at my expense when he was alive.

1529
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:15,663
You know l love you
more than my luggage.

1530
01:47:28,416 --> 01:47:30,281
This is my bench.

1531
01:47:30,652 --> 01:47:32,643
Get off my bench!

1532
01:47:33,388 --> 01:47:35,822
Get off my--!
Good. Now, sit.

1533
01:47:36,024 --> 01:47:39,118
You are too twisted for color TV.

1534
01:47:40,395 --> 01:47:42,226
Have your roots done.

1535
01:47:47,969 --> 01:47:51,632
l shouldn't have gone on
the way l did. l made everybody cry.

1536
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:55,332
Don't be silly. Laughter through
tears is my favorite emotion.

1537
01:47:55,543 --> 01:47:56,908
Thanks, Annelle.

1538
01:47:57,112 --> 01:48:00,309
Maybe l should have
an emotional outburst more often.

1539
01:48:00,515 --> 01:48:02,676
Maybe l should start
having them at home.

1540
01:48:02,884 --> 01:48:04,613
Drum would be so pleased.

1541
01:48:08,523 --> 01:48:11,856
Well, l'm glad to see
the two of you made up.

1542
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:14,358
Ouiser can never stay mad at me.

1543
01:48:14,562 --> 01:48:17,554
She worships the quicksand l walk on.

1544
01:48:23,171 --> 01:48:24,297
You're in my prayers.

1545
01:48:31,312 --> 01:48:33,610
Yes, Annelle, l pray.

1546
01:48:35,683 --> 01:48:38,914
Well, l do. There, l said it.
l hope you're satisfied.

1547
01:48:39,287 --> 01:48:41,346
l have suspected this all along.

1548
01:48:41,723 --> 01:48:45,352
Don't you expect me to come
to one of your churches.

1549
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:49,394
Those tent revivals with those
Bible-beaters doing God-knows-what.

1550
01:48:49,597 --> 01:48:52,361
They'd probably make me eat
a live chicken.

1551
01:48:52,767 --> 01:48:54,291
Not on your first visit.

1552
01:48:55,570 --> 01:48:57,435
Very good, Annelle.

1553
01:48:57,639 --> 01:49:00,199
Spoken like a true smart-ass.

1554
01:49:05,213 --> 01:49:08,205
What are you doing?
Are you eating my picture?

1555
01:49:19,594 --> 01:49:20,993
Let's get in the swing.

1556
01:49:21,563 --> 01:49:23,121
Get our feets in here.

1557
01:49:23,331 --> 01:49:24,161
There we go.

1558
01:49:24,799 --> 01:49:26,323
Hold on.

1559
01:49:35,310 --> 01:49:38,609
l don't know if this is
the right time or place...

1560
01:49:38,813 --> 01:49:40,440
...but l wanted to tell you...

1561
01:49:40,648 --> 01:49:43,640
...that Sammy and l have decided
if this baby's a girl...

1562
01:49:43,852 --> 01:49:45,820
...we'd like to name it Shelby...

1563
01:49:46,254 --> 01:49:49,485
...since she was the reason we met
in the first place.

1564
01:49:49,691 --> 01:49:50,919
lf you don't mind.

1565
01:49:51,126 --> 01:49:52,354
Shelby would love that.

1566
01:49:54,496 --> 01:49:56,157
l'm tickled pink.

1567
01:49:59,234 --> 01:50:00,223
Pink.

1568
01:50:00,802 --> 01:50:04,238
What are you gonna name it
if it happens to be a boy?

1569
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:07,271
Shelby, l guess.

1570
01:50:08,143 --> 01:50:09,974
That's how it should be.

1571
01:50:10,378 --> 01:50:11,970
Life goes on.

1572
01:50:50,985 --> 01:50:53,749
l've never been so uncomfortable
in all my life.

1573
01:50:53,955 --> 01:50:57,755
We'll talk about ''uncomfortable''
when you're nine months pregnant.

1574
01:51:00,428 --> 01:51:03,363
Keep those eyes closed,
or l'll staple them shut.

1575
01:51:03,565 --> 01:51:05,726
-They're closed!
-Keep them closed.

1576
01:51:06,534 --> 01:51:07,967
-Now?
-Ready?

1577
01:51:10,805 --> 01:51:12,033
Keep them shut.

1578
01:51:12,574 --> 01:51:14,269
-Open them up.
-All right.

1579
01:51:16,811 --> 01:51:18,335
l don't believe it!

1580
01:51:18,546 --> 01:51:20,104
l'm a chain!

1581
01:51:24,652 --> 01:51:26,643
-Jesus!
-Lighten up.

1582
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:29,956
Now, you just burst through
those bushes...

1583
01:51:30,158 --> 01:51:32,558
...and hop over to
where the kids are, okay?

1584
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:35,058
What bushes? l can't see shit!

1585
01:51:35,263 --> 01:51:36,491
Over there.

1586
01:51:37,031 --> 01:51:38,430
''Over there.''

1587
01:51:38,633 --> 01:51:40,931
l'm an adult.
l'm not a 5-year-old!

1588
01:51:41,135 --> 01:51:44,298
On your mark. Get set. Go!

1589
01:51:45,073 --> 01:51:48,873
Okay, Jack, Jr.
l'm gonna tell you a story.

1590
01:51:51,012 --> 01:51:54,812
Once upon a time, there was
a beautiful young gal...

1591
01:51:55,016 --> 01:51:56,643
...named Shelby.

1592
01:51:57,252 --> 01:52:00,153
And Shelby had a lovely, kind...

1593
01:52:00,355 --> 01:52:04,189
...and wonderful good fairy named...

1594
01:52:04,392 --> 01:52:05,882
...Clairee.

1595
01:52:06,828 --> 01:52:09,319
But there was also a horrible...

1596
01:52:09,530 --> 01:52:12,499
...evil, ugly witch named...

1597
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:13,894
...Ouiser.

1598
01:52:14,102 --> 01:52:16,570
l hate these stupid
neighborhood things.

1599
01:52:16,771 --> 01:52:19,262
No one's twisting your arm
to keep you here.

1600
01:52:19,474 --> 01:52:21,465
Well, l have to be sociable.

1601
01:52:23,544 --> 01:52:25,205
Rhett's here.

1602
01:52:27,582 --> 01:52:29,573
Let's connect the bald spots.

1603
01:52:31,486 --> 01:52:33,181
Eat shit and die.

1604
01:52:33,388 --> 01:52:34,218
Hello, M'Lynn.

1605
01:52:36,424 --> 01:52:38,790
Good to see you too, Ouiser, Owen.

1606
01:52:40,995 --> 01:52:42,758
Come on, Rhett! Kill, kill!

1607
01:52:42,964 --> 01:52:43,931
Quit it, Drum.

1608
01:52:44,132 --> 01:52:45,997
Stop egging him on.

1609
01:52:49,437 --> 01:52:52,736
And everyone lived happily ever after.

1610
01:52:53,741 --> 01:52:57,302
And the nasty, wicked,
evil, wretched...

1611
01:52:57,512 --> 01:53:00,276
...horrible, mean Ouiser...

1612
01:53:00,715 --> 01:53:03,013
...was never heard from again.

1613
01:53:03,751 --> 01:53:06,879
Now, it's almost time
for the Easter Bunny.

1614
01:53:07,088 --> 01:53:08,680
Run on down.

1615
01:53:24,605 --> 01:53:26,470
Hi, Jack! You remember me?

1616
01:53:26,841 --> 01:53:28,138
lt's your old pal Ouiser.

1617
01:53:33,281 --> 01:53:34,873
Just a second. lt's Jackson.

1618
01:53:35,383 --> 01:53:37,112
Jack, come here!

1619
01:53:46,961 --> 01:53:48,519
ls he all right?

1620
01:53:48,730 --> 01:53:50,493
Yes, he's all right.

1621
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:04,778
Honey, it's okay. lt's okay.

1622
01:54:04,979 --> 01:54:07,607
Women have babies every day.

1623
01:54:07,815 --> 01:54:10,807
Jonathan, quick!
Get that Easter Bunny over here now.

1624
01:54:11,018 --> 01:54:12,952
-Tommy, where's Sammy?
-Over there.

1625
01:54:13,154 --> 01:54:15,179
-Excuse me.
-Why? What's going on?

1626
01:54:15,390 --> 01:54:18,848
Oh, my God! She's gonna have a baby.
Go get a doctor!

1627
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:21,085
Help! A doctor!

1628
01:54:21,295 --> 01:54:22,785
This way, this way.

1629
01:54:26,167 --> 01:54:27,293
Get her in.

1630
01:54:29,237 --> 01:54:30,795
We'll find Sammy.

1631
01:54:32,073 --> 01:54:34,564
lt's all right, honey.
We'll get Sammy.

1632
01:54:49,557 --> 01:54:51,081
Come on, Sammy!

1633
01:54:52,427 --> 01:54:53,985
Get your tail hopping!
