163
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:06,802
From the moment I set eyes on you, I just
knew I could trust you. I can, can't I?

164
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,074
Yes, you can.
- Thank you.

165
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:11,247
Thank you.
You've saved my life.

166
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:12,579
Have I?
- Hmm.

167
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:15,150
A two-pronged attack
should do it. Let's go.

168
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:20,048
Though I don't think you
should mention about Nick.

169
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:24,221
Or Michael.
- Michael?

170
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:26,857
Is he your son?
- My son? Lord, no.

171
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:28,662
Michael wants
to marry me.

172
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:29,826

You don't have to wake
the neighbors about it.

00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:34,432
Besides, that's only three.

176
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:38,269
Phil's rather free
about where he undresses.

177
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:41,336
He's a theater producer.
Well, his father is.

178
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:44,383
Phil's got his first show on at
the Ambassador. I've got the lead.

179
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,678
Well...

180
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:48,113

182
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:57,394
Hello again.

183
00:11:57,463 --> 00:11:59,454
Awfully sorry about earlier. I
thought you were someone else.

184
00:11:59,532 --> 00:12:01,500
That is some relief,
I suppose.

185
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:04,559
Jolly nice to meet you, dear
lady, but who the devil are you?

186
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:06,662
Who is she, gorgeous?

187
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:07,865
She's, um...

188
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:12,168
(LAUGHS) You know, I'm not
altogether sure.

189

Guinevere Pettigrew.

00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:18,616
Guinevere. Wow.

192
00:12:18,684 --> 00:12:20,618
Yes, but who is she?

193
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:23,417
What in the world is she doing
in this particular bedroom

194
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:25,252
when you are
so obviously starkers

195
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:27,121
beneath that delightful
gown, don't you know?

196
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:28,717
We have...

197
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:30,453
An engagement.
- A meeting.

198
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,088
Meeting. Important meeting.
- Indeed we do. In 20.

199
00:12:32,165 --> 00:12:33,189
Two...
- Twenty-two.

200

Not 22, Guinevere,
dearest. Two minutes.

201
00:12:37,537 --> 00:12:38,936
What the dickens
can be as important

202
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:41,735
as another hour in bed
with young Philip-me-lad?

203
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:43,241
You don't mind,
do you, Guinevere?

204
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:45,368
It's all a bit new to me,
and it's devilish good fun.

205
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:47,936
Besides, I have
nothing till lunch.

206

Baby, baby, I'd
love to, but I can't.

211
00:12:58,257 --> 00:13:02,284
Come on, it's an awfully good
cure for a hangover, I'm told.

212
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:04,022
Edythe's lingerie
show is at 11:00.

213
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:06,156
Anyway, haven't you
got to get ready?

214
00:13:06,232 --> 00:13:08,860
Who are you lunching?
- Nobody, really.

Why? She run out of carrots?
- Sweetie-pops...

But you said the lead was mine.
Phil, honey, you promised!

218
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:18,643
It is. It is. I'm sure it
is. You're the one, baby.

219
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:20,508
I just have to
clear it with Daddy,

being the bounder with
the checkbook and all.

You know, he wants me to meet
her. Amazing voice, apparently.

If you like
air-raid sirens.

223

It's just lunch, darling.
Come on, Delysia.

224
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,720
Remind your producer why you're
right for such a passionate part.

225
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:39,956
Charlotte Warren
the actress?

226
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:41,056
Know her, what?

227
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:43,796
I did happen to see her last
night on Shaftesbury Avenue.

228
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,428
With who?
- Who with?

229
00:13:45,505 --> 00:13:47,530
A man.
PHIL:-  Producer?

230
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:48,767
Mmm.
- Spivvy fellow?

231
00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:50,604
Mmm.
- Nasty side-parting?

232
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,734
Mmm.

233
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:53,073
I knew it!

dash it all. On the poach.

235

Well, we'll see
about that.

236
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:03,115
Oh, Phil, you can't think that
Charlotte Warren is right for Hortensia?

237
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:05,817
Not with that
damp little nose.

238
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:22,964
Jacket?
- Behind you.

239
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:28,045
A quick egg
and I'm off.

240
00:14:28,114 --> 00:14:30,173
I regret
we're out of eggs.

241
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:31,910

- I'm afraid I do.

- So sorry, no.

- If only.

- Definitely not.

deliver a loaf yesterday.

Allow me.

248
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:52,265
Guinevere, you've got to get him
out of here. We're on a deadline.

Toast is only
two minutes.

I realize it is not
my place, but

251
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:00,536
isn't it possible simply not to
answer the door to this Nick fellow?

00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:02,547
Oh, I can't do that.
- Why?

It's his flat.
- Oh.

You think so?

293
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:30,956
it has been a most exciting, one might
say exhilarating experience, meeting you,

294
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:36,026
though I can't help feeling one
fraught with moral complexity.

averted, I simply must take my leave.

don't go. The crisis is ongoing.

I don't know what I'd do
if you went. I beg you.

It's Nick.

- Saving?

302
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:55,879
Mmm-hmm. Have you ever been
hypnotized by a snake, Guinevere?

303
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:57,013
I don't believe so, no.

304
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:59,523
Well, it's what they do
to small furry animals.

305
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:03,084
The snake fixes the animal with
its eyes, so it has no will.

306
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:04,959
It stays when it
should be running.

307
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,555
It wants to stay,
even if it means death.

308
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:10,568
And I am that
small furry animal.

309
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:15,073
And Nick Calderelli, coming up the
stairs this very minute, is that snake.

310
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:18,736
When he's here, I just... I can't
resist him. And he's bad for me.

311
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:22,110
So bad. And when I waver,
and I will waver,

312
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:23,705
I need you
to be strong for me.

313
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:31,518
Please. Stay.

00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:37,459
I can see I have no choice.
You're clearly in danger.

Oh, thank you!

But I'm afraid it is you
who must be strong.

to break it off.

319
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:53,941
And with you beside me,
I feel strong,

320
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:55,139
confident, firm.

321
00:18:55,981 --> 00:19:00,509
There is something so sensual about fur
next to the skin, don't you think? Mmm!

322
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:03,214
Miss Lafosse,
you're slipping already.

323
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:05,882
Strong, confident, firm.

324
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:08,622
I know! But I can't help it.

325
00:19:10,162 --> 00:19:11,424
But I must.

326
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,588
(DOOR OPENING)

327
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:13,757
(GASPS) Nick!

328
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,666
I feel like I've just climbed bloody
Everest. The lift's on the blink.

329
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:18,327
(DELYSIA EXCLAIMING)

330
00:19:19,238 --> 00:19:20,603
Darling.

331
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:23,236
It's you!

332
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:25,004
That wasn't you, was it?
- Me?

333
00:19:25,077 --> 00:19:27,136
In the lift?
- The lift?

334
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:31,177
Lift? Oh, you mean elevator.
- That's exactly what I...

335
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:34,651
I didn't know
you had company.

336
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,518
But, Nick, I get so
lonely when you're away.

337
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,506
This is...

338
00:19:38,507 --> 00:19:41,253
Pettigrew.
Guinevere Pettigrew.

339
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:43,989
A pleasure, Miss
Pettigrew, I'm sure.

340
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:46,089
And you are,
what, a friend?

341
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:48,656
I am Miss Lafosse's new
governess... Social secretary.

342
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:50,361
Social secretary.

343
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:51,801
Really?

344
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:55,369
Isn't it a little early
for camouflage?

345
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:57,341
(CHUCKLING)
I beg your pardon?

346
00:19:57,409 --> 00:19:58,706
I haven't had
the opportunity...

347
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:00,176
It's nice to meet you,
Miss Pettigrew,

348
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:02,305
but D and I haven't seen
each other for three weeks.

349
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:04,474
Got a lot of
catching up to do.

350
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,711
So if you
wouldn't mind.

351
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:10,148
But of course.
Good day.

352
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:15,751
(DELYSIA EXCLAIMING)

353
00:20:15,828 --> 00:20:17,489
But, Nick, darling!
- What?

354
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:19,793
Well, I've got a fashion show
to get to. Haven't I, Guinevere?

355
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:24,529
Fashion show be damned. Who
needs clothes, eh, gorgeous?

356
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:28,504
Damned or not, I'm afraid Miss
Lafosse has accepted the invitation.

357
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:30,235
Well, cancel.

358
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:31,469
Come on, darling.

359
00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:32,568
Close the door
on your way out.

360
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:34,613
I'm sure that we can schedule
something for later in the week.

361
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,234
I beg your pardon?

362
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:36,341
I think that Miss
Lafosse has an hour

363
00:20:36,415 --> 00:20:38,950
Wednesday at 9:30.
Shall I pencil it in?

364
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:40,249
No. I'm penciling now.

365
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,412
Nick, darling, I'm afraid
that Guinevere's right.

366
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:44,922
I'm terribly busy
this morning.

367
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:47,814
Oh.

368
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:05,336
You haven't...

369
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:09,413
You haven't had any
other guests, have you?

370
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:12,314
No, darling.
Just us girls together.

371
00:21:12,785 --> 00:21:15,652
I thought I saw Phil
Goldman's car outside.

372
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:17,052
Phil?
- Goldman.

373
00:21:17,122 --> 00:21:18,680
Do we know him?

374
00:21:19,124 --> 00:21:21,251
Andy Goldman's
idiot boy.

375
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:26,022
Pouring Daddy's millions away at the
Ambassador on some stupid musical.

376
00:21:26,098 --> 00:21:28,328
<i>Pile on the Piffle.
- Pepper.</i>

377
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:31,292
Pepper?
- I'm told.

378
00:21:41,213 --> 00:21:44,910
Since when did girls together
smoke cigars? Hmm? Answer me that.

379
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:05,901
If I want to smoke cigars,
I'll damned well smoke cigars,

380
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:08,166
thank you very much.
And to hell with your opinion.

381
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,174
What, they're yours?

382
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:13,572
You betcha, baby.

383
00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:15,341
(COUGHING)

384
00:22:15,714 --> 00:22:16,806
Oh!

385
00:22:17,116 --> 00:22:18,481
And you thought
that I...

386
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,245
What?
- Nick...

387
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,152
You, of all people?
How could you?

388
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:25,588
I'm wounded,
Nicholas, I am wounded.

389
00:22:26,191 --> 00:22:28,056
Darling, sweetheart.

390
00:22:28,494 --> 00:22:31,122
Please forgive me.
It's been a long night. I'm...

391
00:22:31,196 --> 00:22:32,857
No.
- I'm sorry.

392
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:35,993
No. It's...
It's no good.

393
00:22:41,674 --> 00:22:42,971
All right,
I forgive you!

394
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:44,441
Fashion show.

395
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,568
Come again?

396
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:47,168
Fashion show.

397
00:22:47,246 --> 00:22:49,612
Fashion...
Fashion show is right.

398
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:52,708
And that will be your punishment, man
of little faith. You will have to wait.

399
00:22:52,785 --> 00:22:56,312
What? So I'm being thrown out
of my own flat, am I?

400
00:22:56,388 --> 00:22:58,117
I'm sorry, darling.

401
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,789
Very well.

402
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,560
Tonight then.
At the club.

403
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:10,331
Miss Pettigrew.

404
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:11,767
Good day.

405
00:23:12,337 --> 00:23:14,134
Tonight is booked.

406
00:23:27,152 --> 00:23:29,086
You were magnificent!

407
00:23:29,988 --> 00:23:31,285
Are you all right?

408
00:23:31,356 --> 00:23:34,689
I have never sworn
before in my life.

409
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:37,625
Not even in my mind.

410
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:40,130
Well, I didn't hear you swear.
- Yes, I did.

411
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:42,827
I said damned and hell.
And I meant them.

412
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:44,334
Oh, that's not swearing.

413
00:23:44,403 --> 00:23:47,065
They came out of the
sinful category an age ago.

414
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:49,903
Desperation.
That's what it's come to.

415
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:52,944
A little desperation and life can
make of us whatever it chooses.

416
00:23:53,011 --> 00:23:58,916
In my case, a smoking, swearing accomplice
to misdeeds in a den of iniquity.

417
00:23:58,984 --> 00:24:00,815
No! Really?

418
00:24:04,156 --> 00:24:05,623
Oh, you mean here.

419
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:06,680
(LAUGHS)

420
00:24:06,892 --> 00:24:09,360
But I was the desperate one.
I'm always desperate.

421
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:11,794
Think of what would have
happened if you hadn't been here.

422
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:14,958
I shudder to think what
goes on when I'm not here.

423
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:16,796
Morals are very important
to me, Miss Lafosse.

424
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:19,429
I am the daughter
of a clergyman.

425
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:20,802
Poor you.

426
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:24,172
No. It was a perfectly
good upbringing, thank you.

427
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:27,804
But I am beginning to think
perhaps a little sheltered.

428
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,314
But it's not
always like this.

429
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:33,583
Occasionally
it's not like this.

430
00:24:36,688 --> 00:24:38,679
All right, it's always like
this. Is that so very awful?

431
00:24:38,757 --> 00:24:39,849
Please don't go.
You just can't go.

432
00:24:39,925 --> 00:24:43,156
This is the most important
day in my whole life.

433
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:46,189
I'll phone up that Holt lady right
now and I'll double your salary.

434
00:24:46,265 --> 00:24:48,358
Oh, no, no, no! Thank you.
That won't be necessary.

435
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,335
I don't even know
what a social secretary does.

436
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:57,398
I only got one because

437
00:24:57,776 --> 00:25:02,475
<i>Charlotte " Rabbit" Warren's got one,
so I figured I'd better get one, too.</i>

438
00:25:02,548 --> 00:25:04,778
Now that I see you in
action, you're just amazing.

439
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:07,944
Am I? That's very
kind of you to say so.

440
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:13,117
Phil, gone. Nick, gone. And that
cigar. But that was fast thinking.

441
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:15,456
I'm only happy to have
been of assistance.

442
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:17,358
Miss Pettigrew,

443
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:18,919
I love you.

444
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:30,568
Well, come on!

445
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:44,715
DELYSIA: Why don't you slip
something else on, Guinevere?

446
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,384
I mean, nobody died,
did they?

447
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,291
Or did Carole make you wear that
sackcloth and ashes for contrast?

448
00:25:51,363 --> 00:25:53,729
Make herself look
even more amazing.

449
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,061
Carole?

450
00:25:55,734 --> 00:25:57,964
That's not a game I play,
Guinevere, I can assure you.

451
00:25:58,036 --> 00:26:00,368
So, let's lose the
blackout curtain, shall we?

452
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:03,431
These clothes appear to be
the only ones I possess.

453
00:26:03,508 --> 00:26:05,032
You're kidding.

454
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:08,276
Shoes?

455
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:10,107
I'm afraid not.

456
00:26:10,182 --> 00:26:12,776
Oh. So, let's go buy some!

457
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:14,876
I'm not in a position to.

458
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,420
Out of cash?

459
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:19,184
None at all?
- None at all.

460
00:26:19,258 --> 00:26:22,455
Wow. You social secretaries
sure can spend.

461
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:26,354
Roulette, was it? Blackjack?
- Certainly not.

462
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:28,422
Well. Whatever,
it's on me.

463
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,968
No, no, no, I couldn't possibly...
- You sure could possibly.

464
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:33,561
I, for one, am not running around
town with Oliver Twist's mom.

465
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:36,472
After the lingerie show,
we go shopping.

466
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:07,835
It's so frightening.

467
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:13,206
Yeah. Cap sleeves.
It's a horror show.

468
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:17,846
It's a nice color, though.
- Yes, very nice color.

469
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:22,080
Are you cold?

470
00:27:22,154 --> 00:27:24,782
Well, perhaps a little.
- Here.

471
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:28,586
Oh, no, I couldn't.
- No, you must.

472
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,527
It's a little thank-you
for this morning.

473
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:36,092
It's beautiful.

474

Guinevere! Don't
dawdle, we're late!

DELYSIA: Today is the day that
Phil announces to the world

476
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:16,063
<i>who's going to play the lead
in Pile on the Pepper.</i>

And with the lingerie
that I'm about to pick up,

478
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:19,237
it's no contest, honey.

<i>" Delysia Lafosse

How exciting! Is it
to be a West End show?

481
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:27,849
It is to be a West End smash, Guinevere,
and it's going to make me a star.

482
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,386
PETTIGREW: I thought
you were a singer.

483
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:32,480
Well, I've got a voice. But that's
not how you become famous. No.

484
00:28:32,557 --> 00:28:35,025
First stop, West End.
Next stop, Hollywood.

485
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:36,560
Have you done much
of that sort of thing?

486
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:38,095
<i>Didn't you catch
Every Day's a Holiday?</i>

487

One of mine.
- Mae West!

488
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:42,586
Oh, you did see it?

489
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:44,531
Oh, yes! Which part were you?

490
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,101
I was in the restaurant scene.

491
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:49,265
In the back.
- Really?

492
00:28:49,341 --> 00:28:51,275
Behind the palm tree
drinking a margarita.

493
00:28:51,343 --> 00:28:51,509
I...

494
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,334
I think they cut that
for the European print.

495

<i>A little de trop for you
English, if you know what I mean?</i>

496

<i>Of course. Of course
there's Four's a Crowd,</i>

497
00:28:57,215 --> 00:29:00,378
with Errol Flynn and...
- Olivia de Havilland!

498
00:29:00,452 --> 00:29:01,527
<i>Seen that as well?</i>

499
00:29:01,528 --> 00:29:03,421
Four's a Crowd is
a wonderful picture.

500
00:29:03,488 --> 00:29:04,682
Who were you?
- The crowd.

501
00:29:04,756 --> 00:29:06,815
Here we are.
Quick, quick.

502
00:29:35,353 --> 00:29:38,015
Guinevere. Come on.
Don't be shy.

503
00:29:44,963 --> 00:29:46,294
She's naked!

504
00:29:46,364 --> 00:29:50,926
Well, hardly. There's so much whalebone on
her, I'm looking for a tail and flippers.

- I recognize her.

Edythe? She owns the

All the latest gossip.

Oh. Oh,
that's just Joe.

00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,507
He designs underwear.

520
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:35,739
And not these walking
air-raid shelters.

521

Beautiful things.

- Margery!

So, what can you do to prop
up this ancient monument?

546
00:31:57,395 --> 00:31:58,885
If you must talk
of ancient monuments,

547
00:31:58,964 --> 00:32:01,762
did you know that the Elgin
Marbles were once painted?

548
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:04,996
No, I can't say that I did.
Bright, garish colors. Awful.

549
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:08,062
Now aren't they
better just marble,

550
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:12,041
worn a little into something
wise, as well as beautiful?

551

Joe Blomfield, you are
the world's best flatterer.

Or maybe I'm saying
you belong in a museum.

You don't tamper with
a masterpiece, Margery.

554
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:27,251
You allow it to be.

555
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:29,293
That's my advice to you.

looks perfect on you.

558
00:32:42,674 --> 00:32:45,165
Well, thank you.
It was a present.

559

You know, I think it's the most
beautiful thing I've ever worn.

Sorry?
- It's one of mine.

You really didn't know.

answer the telephone.

- I was in the bathroom.

Having a bath?

574
00:33:50,391 --> 00:33:51,969
No, I just didn't
answer the telephone,

575
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:53,476
and now Joe says
the engagement's off.

576
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:56,878
Just because of one stupid
little misunderstanding.

Edythe, Miss Pettigrew.
Edythe Dubarry.

Miss Pettigrew is my
new social secretary.

Really?

580
00:34:06,057 --> 00:34:07,615
How intriguing.

581
00:34:07,692 --> 00:34:10,183
I know. Lost her shirt
playing poker or something.

582

I never forget a face.

You really shouldn't wear
those muddy browns, you know.

Come with us!

We can do Guinevere, and
you can tell me all about Joe

and I can tell you about
my amazing morning.

Hang it all, the bone structure's
there. Why the devil not?

Beatrice, cancel my appointments.
I'm suddenly inconvenienced.

Perfect!
Come on, now!

DELYSIA: She didn't like him.

604
00:35:07,352 --> 00:35:10,515
Good heavens! He let her?
- He was no match for her.

605

My dear, the woman can
do anything. Anything.

606
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:16,725
No. Definitely not. It's too pink,
it's too passé. Not that one, either.

607
00:35:16,795 --> 00:35:19,127
And she's coming to the party?
- Well, of course.

<i>She's going to clinch the lead

Oh, no, not the red. Not
with her hair, I think.

610
00:35:24,302 --> 00:35:26,736
But I thought you'd secured
that deal last night.

611
00:35:26,805 --> 00:35:28,170
Well, I thought so, too.

612
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:31,675
And I played it magnificently,
if I do say so myself.

613
00:35:33,178 --> 00:35:35,646
But then Phil announced that he was
going to have lunch with the Rabbit.

614
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:36,839
Charlotte Warren?
- Mmm.

Oh, my dear.
- Exactly.

616
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:41,247
So you can see why I
need Guinevere's powers.

617
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:42,718
I do indeed.

618
00:35:43,822 --> 00:35:45,187
I wonder...

619
00:35:46,024 --> 00:35:47,082
Yes?

620
00:35:48,693 --> 00:35:50,092
Oh, nothing.

621
00:35:51,796 --> 00:35:52,785
That one!
- That one!

00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,960
Miss Lafosse? Oh!

623
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,400
Oh!

624
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:06,968
Thank you. Very nice.

625
00:36:23,495 --> 00:36:26,020
Guinevere,
I think we're ready.

626
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:35,570
And you're sure that's all
it was, Edythe, my dear?

627
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,938
Just a late train?
No Gerry involved?

628
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:39,499
You're as bad as Joe.

629
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:42,705
Gerry and I are finished.
Absolutely finished.

630
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:49,383
So Tabitha and I bumped into him
at Hat Day at the races. What of it?

631
00:36:49,454 --> 00:36:52,321
We got the last train in to Victoria
and that was absolutely that.

632
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,382
My fruit fedora was much
admired, thank you for asking.

633
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,190
Joe can check with the station
if he's so damnably suspicious.

634
00:36:58,263 --> 00:37:01,596
Arrived at 11:30 and took
a taxi straight home. Alone.

635
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:02,758
The whole thing
is ridiculous.

636
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:05,564
One late train and the
whole marriage is off.

637
00:37:05,637 --> 00:37:08,538
Men are so untrusting.
I can't think why.

638
00:37:11,543 --> 00:37:13,135
Are you all right?

639
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:18,380
Sorry, I was just
remembering something.

640
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:23,281
Everything all right,
Guinevere?

641
00:37:23,354 --> 00:37:25,788
PETTIGREW:
Oh, yes. Just a moment.

642
00:37:32,797 --> 00:37:33,786
(GIGGLES)

643
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:37,232
This is me?

644
00:37:37,802 --> 00:37:39,292
All you.

645
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,099
As nature intended.

646
00:37:43,908 --> 00:37:46,240
Guinevere, control
yourself, for heaven's sake!

647
00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:47,301
The mascara!

648
00:37:47,302 --> 00:37:49,280
No, of course.
Of course.

649
00:37:49,614 --> 00:37:50,945
That was close.

650
00:37:51,015 --> 00:37:53,483
Well, I'm just gonna put this, and a
few other things, on Nick's account.

651
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:55,348
I'll be right back.

652
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:03,152
Well, what
a transformation.

653
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:07,260
I suppose I've never felt
I really deserved it.

654
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:10,991
A social secretary
such as yourself?

655
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:14,163
Carole Lombard's social
secretary, no less.

656
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:16,535
Eyeliner.

657
00:38:26,751 --> 00:38:29,413
As you're such
a wow with the men,

658
00:38:29,487 --> 00:38:32,581
I was wondering whether you
could have a word with Joe for me.

659
00:38:32,657 --> 00:38:35,524
Smooth this little
misunderstanding over.

660
00:38:36,427 --> 00:38:39,555
We're getting married,
you know. Were.

661
00:38:39,631 --> 00:38:41,724
It would mean
such a lot to me.

662
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:44,029
I'm afraid
I couldn't do that.

663
00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:46,263
Really?

664
00:38:48,006 --> 00:38:52,534
You and I, Guinevere, we don't have
what the Delysias of this world have.

665
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:55,776
We have to work at it,
improvise a touch,

666
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:57,280
act a little to get
what we want.

667
00:38:57,348 --> 00:38:59,714
You know what I mean,
don't you?

668
00:39:00,385 --> 00:39:01,511
There.

669
00:39:01,586 --> 00:39:03,019
I'm sure Delysia
wouldn't mind.

670
00:39:03,087 --> 00:39:05,988
DELYSIA: Well, that should put a
few more gray hairs on Nick's head.

671
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:08,582
My, you do look ravishing.
- Wonderful news!

672
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,221
Guinevere has very kindly offered
to sort things out with Joe for me.

673
00:39:12,296 --> 00:39:15,823
But that's a marvelous idea. If anybody
can make Joe see sense, Guinevere can.

674
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,595
Isn't that right?

675
00:39:17,669 --> 00:39:19,364
Okay. Come on.

676
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,541
(PIANO PLAYING)

677
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,614
Listen.

678
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:38,981
Nick?

679
00:39:40,224 --> 00:39:42,021
Fingers like bananas.

680
00:39:42,427 --> 00:39:43,519
Philip?

681
00:39:44,629 --> 00:39:46,893
Oh, yes.
Charlotte Warren.

682
00:39:46,964 --> 00:39:48,295
Permit me.

683
00:39:56,774 --> 00:39:58,605
Thief. Burglar.

684
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,806
I've had some reactions to my
playing, but never quite that.

685
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:04,109
I saw you at the jail.
I saw you.

686
00:40:05,049 --> 00:40:06,880
Oh, it's you!

687
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:09,482
I say, I'm awfully
sorry about that.

688
00:40:09,554 --> 00:40:10,851
Michael!

689
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:16,153
It's so good to see you.
However did you get in?

690
00:40:16,227 --> 00:40:17,956
One picks up a few tricks
in prison, you know?

691
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:21,089
Breaking and entering
being one of them.

692
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:22,189
So.

693
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:25,567
What have you got
to say for yourself?

694
00:40:25,636 --> 00:40:26,660
Oh, well...

695
00:40:26,738 --> 00:40:29,434
I think I must have gotten the
days mixed up. Or was it the place?

696
00:40:29,507 --> 00:40:31,441
I'm awfully sorry, Michael.

697
00:40:31,509 --> 00:40:33,534
Can you ever forgive me?

698
00:40:34,746 --> 00:40:36,509
(DELYSIA EXCLAIMING)

699
00:40:37,014 --> 00:40:38,504
Now what do you say?

700
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:42,781
Part of me says if you do that again,
I'll heave you through the goddamn window.

701
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:45,379
And another part
of me says that

702
00:40:46,057 --> 00:40:49,322
I deserve it. Every bit.

703
00:40:49,393 --> 00:40:53,124
Oh, no. Don't play that game
with me. Not this time, Delysia.

704
00:40:53,197 --> 00:40:54,824
What do you mean?

705
00:40:54,899 --> 00:40:57,732
You've made a fool out
of me for the last time.

706
00:40:57,835 --> 00:41:00,099
Oh, don't say that, Michael.

707
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:02,162
You can do anything
you like to me. Anything.

708
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,438
Shake me again... No, better not
stand too close to the window.

709
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:08,035
Or maybe,

710
00:41:09,547 --> 00:41:11,208
maybe kiss me?

711
00:41:19,991 --> 00:41:21,481
Not a chance.

712
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:23,924
Why, you...
- I'm crazy about you.

713
00:41:23,995 --> 00:41:26,725
You know that. But even I've
got my limit and I've reached it.

714
00:41:26,798 --> 00:41:29,096
No more games,
no more lies.

715
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:33,160
No more Phil, no more Nick.
It's me, just me, or that's it.

716
00:41:33,971 --> 00:41:35,063
I'll never
see you again.

717
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:36,766
You wouldn't.

718
00:41:36,841 --> 00:41:38,968
<i>See this? The Queen Mary.</i>

719
00:41:39,043 --> 00:41:41,238
Two tickets. Sails for
New York tomorrow morning.

720
00:41:41,312 --> 00:41:45,874
I'm playing the Upper Deck Cocktail
Bar, with an as-yet-unannounced singer.

721
00:41:46,517 --> 00:41:48,485
Now tell me I wouldn't.

722
00:41:49,854 --> 00:41:50,912
But what about
the cabaret?

723
00:41:50,988 --> 00:41:54,082
You and me together,
we're the best in London.

724
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:56,824
So we'll be the best
in New York.

725
00:42:04,502 --> 00:42:05,696
Or not.

726
00:42:10,074 --> 00:42:12,042
Isn't there a decent drink
in this hellhole?

727
00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:14,100
Yes. What would you like?

728
00:42:15,046 --> 00:42:16,604
It's me who should
be offering you a drink.

729
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:20,811
After our unfortunate meeting
yesterday, I am definitely in your debt.

730
00:42:20,885 --> 00:42:22,785
How do you take
your whiskey?

731
00:42:22,854 --> 00:42:25,220
He does seem to be a little
agitated about something.

732
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:26,483
Yes.

733
00:42:27,225 --> 00:42:29,716
Well, I'm afraid that might be my fault.
- Indeed?

734
00:42:29,794 --> 00:42:32,024
Ice pick?
- It's in the drawer.

735
00:42:32,129 --> 00:42:34,563
Somewhere.
Ice in the Fridgidaire?

736
00:42:34,632 --> 00:42:36,259
I want the pick
for murder, not ice.

737
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:37,323
(CHUCKLES)

738
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:39,335
See? He's such
a hothead.

739
00:42:39,403 --> 00:42:40,836
He takes love
so seriously.

740
00:42:40,905 --> 00:42:42,270
Is that a problem?

741
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,331
Of course
it's a problem!

742
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:46,000
Michael Pardew.

743
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:49,771
Pettigrew.
Guinevere Pettigrew.

744
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:52,077
About time we had
a formal introduction.

745
00:42:52,149 --> 00:42:53,173
It's certainly a problem

746
00:42:53,251 --> 00:42:55,742
when the girl doesn't
pitch up for the proposal.

747
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,551
Oh, Michael.

748
00:42:56,552 --> 00:42:58,380
Not a word from you.
Thank you.

749
00:42:58,456 --> 00:43:00,549
What do think of this?
Private boat on the Thames,

750
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:02,149
last of the
season's strawberries,

751
00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:04,319
Dom Pérignon champagne.
Everything.

752
00:43:04,395 --> 00:43:07,262
Strawberries.
And you didn't appear?

753
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:08,958
I was scared.

754
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:10,500
You were scared?

755
00:43:10,568 --> 00:43:12,900
How do you think a pianist without
two shillings to rub together

756
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:16,736
feels proposing to the most
beautiful woman in the world?

757
00:43:16,807 --> 00:43:18,206
Dare I ask
what happened?

758
00:43:18,276 --> 00:43:20,574
Well, after an hour and a half
bobbing around on my own,

759
00:43:20,645 --> 00:43:22,636
I opened the champagne.

760
00:43:22,713 --> 00:43:25,978
One glass didn't seem enough.
One thing led to another.

761
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,813
Then I had a bit
of a brainwave,

762
00:43:27,885 --> 00:43:29,764
as we floated pastthe
Tower of London.

763
00:43:29,765 --> 00:43:30,149
Oh, dear.

764
00:43:30,221 --> 00:43:33,122
Decided the ring I had
wasn't good enough for her.

765
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,714
Well, when a fellow
needs a diamond,

766
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:38,284
what better place to get one
than the Tower of London?

767
00:43:38,729 --> 00:43:41,163
The rest is all
a bit hazy, but

768
00:43:41,232 --> 00:43:43,996
there appears to have been an
altercation with the yeoman of the guard.

769
00:43:44,068 --> 00:43:45,797
(GASPS) You didn't.

770
00:43:46,804 --> 00:43:48,965
Thirty days
bread and water.

771
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:53,572
But you know what?

772
00:43:53,644 --> 00:43:56,078
Prison certainly
clears the head.

773
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,210
Pure and simple,
I want you to marry me.

774
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:03,486
And it's a one-word
conversation, Delysia.

775
00:44:08,392 --> 00:44:12,852
Don't you think that on
such a momentous occasion

776
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:14,420
a little time
should be allowed?

777
00:44:14,498 --> 00:44:16,261
Oh, stalling tactic.

778
00:44:17,468 --> 00:44:19,285
Is it because I'm not
rich enough for her?

779
00:44:19,286 --> 00:44:19,834
Certainly not.

780
00:44:19,904 --> 00:44:23,135
Well, it's true. I'm wearing
most of my worldly possessions.

781
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:26,134
I could never offer
this kind of blackmail.

782
00:44:26,135 --> 00:44:26,267
Oh.

783
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:28,505
And who pays you
for playing the piano, huh?

784
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:30,706
You telling me you give Nick
his money back after every show?

785
00:44:30,781 --> 00:44:34,114
No! And every damned shilling
I take hurts me to the bone.

786
00:44:34,185 --> 00:44:37,211
Which is why it's got
to change, Delysia.

787
00:44:37,288 --> 00:44:40,780
Money or love? That's the
question I'm asking, D.

788
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:46,187
With you singing and me playing,
we could knock the world flat.

789
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:51,062
Yes or no, Delysia?

790
00:44:52,903 --> 00:44:56,771
You are a most uncommonly
persuasive man, Mr. Pardew.

791
00:44:59,577 --> 00:45:01,340
But surely a lady
should have a moment or two

792
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:03,937
to consider the most
important decision of her life?

793
00:45:04,015 --> 00:45:05,642
A moment?
She's had a whole year.

794
00:45:05,716 --> 00:45:06,944
You did say you
were in my debt.

795
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,545
Damn it, I did, too.
Fair enough.

796
00:45:13,724 --> 00:45:15,589
Okay, here's the deal.

797
00:45:15,926 --> 00:45:18,588
I'll play for you today,
Delysia,

798
00:45:18,662 --> 00:45:21,859
and for the rest of your
life, if you'll marry me.

799
00:45:22,733 --> 00:45:24,724
Never again
if you don't.

800
00:45:29,407 --> 00:45:31,898
See you later, Miss Pettigrew.
- Later?

801
00:45:31,976 --> 00:45:34,342
In my professional
capacity.

802
00:45:38,282 --> 00:45:39,749
As for you,

803
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:41,808
it's now or never.

804
00:45:41,886 --> 00:45:44,218
The ship sails
tomorrow morning.

805
00:45:47,024 --> 00:45:48,321
He is...

806
00:45:49,293 --> 00:45:51,318
Impossible.
- Magnificent.

807
00:45:53,998 --> 00:45:55,761
So you marry him.

808
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:07,509
Guinevere?
- Mmm-hmm?

809
00:46:08,279 --> 00:46:11,806
Tell me the honest truth.
It's a darned fix, isn't it?

810
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:16,579
Nothing that can't be unfixed
with some good common sense.

811
00:46:17,188 --> 00:46:19,053
But take a look
at the headlines.

812
00:46:19,123 --> 00:46:22,991
With Nick, I get this magnificent
flat and my job at the Peacock.

813
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:24,856
And with Phil,

814
00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:28,660
I get the best part on the West End
stage and my chance to be a star.

815
00:46:28,732 --> 00:46:30,427
And with Michael?

816
00:46:31,669 --> 00:46:33,296
With Michael...

817
00:46:34,405 --> 00:46:36,566
I get the best friend
I ever had.

818
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,574
Is that all Michael is?

819
00:46:38,909 --> 00:46:40,206
Well,

820
00:46:43,414 --> 00:46:45,541
he's rather passionate, too.

821
00:46:52,823 --> 00:46:54,984
I know what
you're thinking.

822
00:46:55,693 --> 00:46:57,524
Michael's the one.

823
00:47:02,633 --> 00:47:04,396
But what about
everything else?

824
00:47:04,468 --> 00:47:06,265
And who says I'm looking
for a darned husband

825
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:07,770
this very minute, anyway?

826
00:47:09,106 --> 00:47:12,371
Not everything comes along
just when we want it.

827
00:47:14,578 --> 00:47:17,308
There are times when
choices just have to be made,

828
00:47:17,381 --> 00:47:19,747
or you certainly
will miss out.

829
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:21,346
No.

830
00:47:21,752 --> 00:47:24,243
No, I won't accept that.
I won't.

831
00:47:24,321 --> 00:47:28,451
<i>This " all of you or none of
you" stuff that Michael's pulling.</i>

832
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,187
It's too much.

833
00:47:31,262 --> 00:47:33,321
But he is in love
with you, Delysia.

834
00:47:33,397 --> 00:47:35,888
Can you say that
about anyone else?

835
00:47:37,768 --> 00:47:39,201
Guinevere,

836
00:47:40,538 --> 00:47:43,803
haven't you ever been torn between
more than one person at the same time?

837
00:47:43,874 --> 00:47:48,004
(CHUCKLES) No, I can't say I've had
that particular problem.

838
00:47:51,248 --> 00:47:53,011
You are beautiful, Delysia.

839
00:47:54,818 --> 00:47:58,413
Well, it's not a bad figure,
if I do say so myself.

840
00:48:02,193 --> 00:48:05,128
Have you ever been
in love at all, Guinevere?

841
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:08,464
Once.
- And was it this

842
00:48:08,933 --> 00:48:10,992
<i>" all of you
or none of you" stuff?</i>

843
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:12,296
Oh, yes.

844
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:14,269
From him or from you?

845
00:48:15,072 --> 00:48:16,096
Both.

846
00:48:16,173 --> 00:48:18,403
Really? Do tell.

847
00:48:19,877 --> 00:48:21,037
No.

848
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:23,513
All a long time ago.

849
00:48:23,581 --> 00:48:26,414
You'll catch your death.
Put this on.

850
00:48:31,488 --> 00:48:32,887
(DOORBELL RINGING)

851
00:48:33,257 --> 00:48:34,690
Allow me.

852
00:48:39,396 --> 00:48:41,057
Excuse me, madam.

853
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:44,991
Excuse me.

854
00:48:47,771 --> 00:48:49,136
Excuse me?

855
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,135
Take that through
to the kitchen, please.

856
00:48:52,209 --> 00:48:55,303
And you do the same as well.
And tell John to pull the rug up.

857
00:48:55,379 --> 00:48:57,609
Party about to start
soon, so chop-chop.

858
00:48:57,681 --> 00:48:59,774
Party? There's a party?

859
00:49:01,151 --> 00:49:02,743
Miss Lafosse?
- Hmm?

860
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,812
There's a troop of people downstairs who
appear to be under the misapprehension

861
00:49:05,889 --> 00:49:07,550
there is to be
a party here.

862
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:08,853
Yes.

863
00:49:08,926 --> 00:49:10,086
Today?

864
00:49:10,761 --> 00:49:12,820
Yes. Didn't I say?
- No.

865
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:13,919
Oh.

866
00:49:14,398 --> 00:49:15,729
Silly me.

867
00:49:16,734 --> 00:49:18,827
Will there be many people?

868
00:49:18,902 --> 00:49:20,836
I should say so,
Guinevere.

869
00:49:20,904 --> 00:49:21,996
It's the big one.

870
00:49:22,072 --> 00:49:23,903
<i>The big one?
- Pile on the Pepper.</i>

871
00:49:23,974 --> 00:49:26,238
Phil's going to make
the announcement.

872
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:27,470
What do you think?

873
00:49:27,544 --> 00:49:29,603
Do I get the part? Hmm?

874
00:49:30,214 --> 00:49:31,476
Oh, yes.

875
00:49:51,669 --> 00:49:55,036
My dear, you look as if you've never
been to a cocktail party in your life.

876
00:49:55,105 --> 00:49:56,766
Why, thank you,
but I don't drink.

877
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,536
Oh, it's not a drink,
really. It's a cocktail.

878
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:01,373
Good luck, darlings.

879
00:50:01,879 --> 00:50:04,177
Joe's the old one
over there.

880
00:50:07,718 --> 00:50:09,413
Work your magic.

881
00:50:16,093 --> 00:50:17,355
(DOOR OPENING)

882
00:50:19,196 --> 00:50:20,390
(DOOR CLOSING)

883
00:50:21,865 --> 00:50:23,127
(DELYSIA GASPS)

884
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:25,701
Of all the nerve.

885
00:50:25,769 --> 00:50:28,863
Well. Time to make
the Rabbit run.

886
00:50:28,939 --> 00:50:30,497
Are you sure
that's wise?

887
00:50:30,574 --> 00:50:31,666
Mmm.

888
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,209
Phil, darling.

889
00:50:34,278 --> 00:50:37,475
Delysia, sweetheart.
Lovely to see you.

890
00:50:37,548 --> 00:50:40,016
This is Charlotte Warren.

891
00:50:41,552 --> 00:50:43,520
PHIL: Do you know
each other?

892
00:50:43,587 --> 00:50:44,918
A pleasure.

893
00:50:44,988 --> 00:50:46,785
How nice
to see you again.

894
00:50:46,857 --> 00:50:50,293
Phil and I had such a lovely lunch
together today, didn't we, darling?

895
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:53,125
Well, I thought he'd have a
big appetite, after last night.

896
00:50:53,197 --> 00:50:55,222
May I suggest retiring
to a safe distance?

897
00:50:55,299 --> 00:50:57,130
I think you're
absolutely right.

898
00:50:57,201 --> 00:50:58,668
Tin hat on.

899
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:04,129
I'm sorry,
it's Phil Goldman.

900
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:05,766
How do you do?
- We've met before, actually.

901
00:51:05,843 --> 00:51:08,038
You were entirely
naked at the time.

902
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:10,112
Guinevere?

903
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,205
Is that you?
My goodness!

904
00:51:12,516 --> 00:51:13,608
You look marvelous.

905
00:51:13,684 --> 00:51:17,017
Charlotte, I just wanted to let
you know there are no hard feelings.

906
00:51:17,087 --> 00:51:19,282
That is so
gracious of you.

907
00:51:19,757 --> 00:51:22,988
To the victor the spoils, to the
vanquished two comps for Press Night.

908
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,527
And so wise.

909
00:51:24,595 --> 00:51:27,063
I hope I can be
like that one day.

910
00:51:27,831 --> 00:51:30,561
Wisdom requires more than
the passing of years, I fear.

911
00:51:30,634 --> 00:51:34,195
Though a little bird tells me that the
part of the crippled mother is still open.

912
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,705
You'd look ravishing
with a stick.

913
00:51:36,907 --> 00:51:39,068
(BOTH LAUGH)

914
00:51:39,877 --> 00:51:44,780
And I won't forget about those
tickets. Is it two, three, four...

915
00:51:44,848 --> 00:51:48,443
Silly me, I've forgotten how
many boyfriends you've got.

916
00:51:51,922 --> 00:51:53,082
Now, Philip,

917
00:51:53,157 --> 00:51:55,921
<i>how are your deliberations over
Pile on the Pepper proceeding?</i>

918
00:51:55,993 --> 00:51:58,018
Well, between
you and me,

919
00:51:58,395 --> 00:52:00,488
Charlotte has the most
alluring singing voice.

920
00:52:00,564 --> 00:52:04,432
And I have to say, Daddy's quite
keen. In fact, more than keen.

921
00:52:04,501 --> 00:52:07,231
So you're going to give
Miss Warren the part?

922
00:52:07,337 --> 00:52:11,296
Delysia's going to be a bit
off-color about it all, I'm afraid.

923
00:52:14,311 --> 00:52:16,609
Hey ho.
- Just one question.

924
00:52:17,414 --> 00:52:20,975
Does Charlotte have quite the
same attachment to you as Delysia?

925
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:23,849
No. No, no,
she certainly doesn't.

926
00:52:25,322 --> 00:52:27,552
Do you think that was more
than a passing attraction?

927
00:52:27,624 --> 00:52:30,218
I mean, we both
know actresses, Guinevere.

928
00:52:30,294 --> 00:52:33,195
It did occur to me
that it might be, you know,

929
00:52:33,263 --> 00:52:35,288
purely to secure the part?

930
00:52:35,632 --> 00:52:39,591
I have no doubt that Miss Lafosse
believes that you are one of the most...

931
00:52:41,705 --> 00:52:44,936
Unquestionably, the most
important man in that room.

932
00:52:45,008 --> 00:52:47,408
My dear woman,
do you really think so?

933
00:52:47,478 --> 00:52:48,604
I do.

934
00:52:49,213 --> 00:52:51,875
The scales have fallen
from my doubting eyes.

935
00:52:51,949 --> 00:52:53,814
So pleased to have helped.
- Helped?

936
00:52:53,884 --> 00:52:57,115
You've just made me
the happiest man in the world.

937
00:52:58,255 --> 00:53:00,189
You seem to have made
quite an impression on him.

938
00:53:00,257 --> 00:53:03,192
Oh. Yes.
I do, don't I?

939
00:53:04,862 --> 00:53:06,159
Joe Blomfield.

940
00:53:07,664 --> 00:53:09,325
A great pleasure.

941
00:53:09,399 --> 00:53:12,960
Have we met before? I feel sure
I recognize you from somewhere.

942
00:53:13,036 --> 00:53:14,663
I don't think so,

943
00:53:14,738 --> 00:53:17,673
but I'm delighted
to make your acquaintance.

944
00:53:23,914 --> 00:53:26,474
I have met your fiancée,
I believe.

945
00:53:27,217 --> 00:53:28,445
Edythe? Um...

946
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,483
No longer my fiancée,
I'm afraid.

947
00:53:31,555 --> 00:53:34,922
Really? I'm so sorry.
Not a permanent rift, I hope?

948
00:53:35,692 --> 00:53:38,525
It would be ungentlemanly
of me to go into the details.

949
00:53:38,595 --> 00:53:39,994
Of course.

950
00:53:43,734 --> 00:53:45,827
You know, these things
are amazing, aren't they?

951
00:53:45,903 --> 00:53:47,063
May I?

952
00:53:47,404 --> 00:53:49,463
Why not?
- Excuse me.

953
00:53:55,379 --> 00:53:56,676
Progress?

954
00:53:57,014 --> 00:53:58,572
I'm afraid not.

955
00:53:58,916 --> 00:54:00,144
Nor is there likely to be.

956
00:54:00,217 --> 00:54:02,913
Transformations work
both ways, Guinevere.

957
00:54:02,986 --> 00:54:07,320
It would take me 30 seconds to put
you back in the soup kitchen queue.

958
00:54:08,425 --> 00:54:11,189
I told you,
I never forget a face.

960
00:54:13,363 --> 00:54:17,094
Nor have I forgotten with whom
you shared a taxi last night.

961
00:54:18,769 --> 00:54:20,236
Oh, you have.

962
00:54:20,304 --> 00:54:23,330
If you want to continue
working for Delysia, you have.

963
00:54:23,407 --> 00:54:26,865
Now we all of us need things in
our life. I need Joe for his...

964
00:54:26,944 --> 00:54:30,402
Well, he's a man of
connections. And you need...

965
00:54:31,815 --> 00:54:34,978
You need to stay off of
the streets, I imagine.

966
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:46,852
I see Edythe
has told you all.

967
00:54:48,432 --> 00:54:53,028
If it weren't to commit another
indiscretion, I might disclose Edythe is...

968
00:54:55,372 --> 00:54:58,273
As Miss Lafosse would say,
crazy about you.

969
00:54:59,109 --> 00:55:00,940
To be indiscreet back,

970
00:55:01,011 --> 00:55:05,846
she's rather more crazy about my position
in the fashion world than she is about me.

971
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:08,680
A woman scorned
is a dangerous thing.

972
00:55:08,752 --> 00:55:11,812
And a bruised heart will often
speak harshly, Mr. Blomfield.

973
00:55:11,888 --> 00:55:15,824
Oh, I sometimes wonder where
Edythe's heart has got to.

974
00:55:16,627 --> 00:55:20,222
A woman with an absent heart
would not shed such tears, I think.

975
00:55:20,297 --> 00:55:21,491
Edythe?

976
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:24,156
Shed tears?

parties and your subterfuges.

979
00:55:33,377 --> 00:55:35,675
You're all playing at love.

980
00:55:35,746 --> 00:55:38,579
One minute her, the next minute
someone else. Flit, flit, flit.

Well, if Miss P said it,
you can bet your shirt on it.

01:17:12,374 --> 01:17:14,103
She said no.

1251
01:17:14,176 --> 01:17:15,234
What, and she does
what you say?

1252
01:17:15,311 --> 01:17:17,142
Never once, as a matter of
fact, but that's not the point.

1253
01:17:17,212 --> 01:17:19,407
The point is she doesn't
want to sing. End of story.

1254
01:17:19,481 --> 01:17:21,176
Let's go, Delysia.

1255
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:22,675
No.

1256
01:17:23,786 --> 01:17:26,016
I'm warning you,
Calderelli.

1257
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,747
You, warning me?

1258
01:17:27,823 --> 01:17:28,983
(CHUCKLES)

1259
01:17:30,025 --> 01:17:31,822
After you, Delysia.

1260
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,229
PETTIGREW:
Sock him in the jaw!

1261
01:17:40,302 --> 01:17:41,428
ALL: What?

1262
01:17:45,107 --> 01:17:47,507
I'm a pianist, damn it.
It could ruin me.

1263
01:17:47,576 --> 01:17:49,669
Why, you pathetic...

1264
01:17:51,947 --> 01:17:53,209
Darling.

1265
01:17:53,315 --> 01:17:54,646
This is your fault.

1266
01:17:54,717 --> 01:17:56,116
Is the offer still open?

1267
01:17:56,185 --> 01:17:57,379
Get up!

1268
01:18:00,689 --> 01:18:03,419
Well? Is it a yes
or is it a no?

1269
01:18:03,726 --> 01:18:04,750
What?

1270
01:18:04,827 --> 01:18:08,126
Will you doggone marry me
or will you doggone not?

1271
01:18:24,179 --> 01:18:26,875
Yes. God help me. Yes.

1272
01:19:42,157 --> 01:19:44,625
PETTIGREW: I don't think
I can bear it again.

1273
01:19:47,162 --> 01:19:48,629
Did you lose many?

1274
01:19:48,697 --> 01:19:50,597
Just one. You?

1275
01:19:52,267 --> 01:19:54,792
Almost every
school friend I had.

1276
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:02,139
One tries to forget.

1277
01:20:02,611 --> 01:20:04,511
If only one could.

1278
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:11,713
You know, I distracted
myself with ridiculous things,

1279
01:20:11,787 --> 01:20:13,880
youth, parties,
lingerie.

1280
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:17,721
I mean, I trained in
socks, for goodness sake.

1281
01:20:17,793 --> 01:20:19,158
Socks?

1282
01:20:20,929 --> 01:20:25,263
There's a great deal of engineering in
a gentleman's sock, I'll have you know.

1283
01:20:25,334 --> 01:20:27,393
Stitching of the heel...

1284
01:20:27,469 --> 01:20:30,495
By comparison, designing a
brassiere is a piece of cake.

1285
01:20:30,572 --> 01:20:34,702
Not that there
aren't compensations.

1286
01:20:34,776 --> 01:20:37,142
None of them
over 20, I imagine.

1287
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:41,679
And all very easy
on the eye.

1288
01:20:42,985 --> 01:20:44,748
But you know what?

1289
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:47,711
I'm done with it.

1290
01:20:47,789 --> 01:20:50,485
I'm going back
to gentlemen's hosiery.

1291
01:20:50,559 --> 01:20:53,392
You know who you are
with an honest pair of socks.

1292
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:56,060
You certainly do.

1293
01:21:03,872 --> 01:21:06,170
Told you about Gerry,
has she?

1294
01:21:06,775 --> 01:21:09,335
Didn't take you long
to move on, hmm?

1295
01:21:09,411 --> 01:21:10,503
Joe?

1296
01:21:11,446 --> 01:21:13,141
Hello, Edythe.

1297
01:21:13,215 --> 01:21:17,049
Did she also tell you that she hangs
around the soup kitchen at the station?

1298
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:21,681
A tramp masquerading as some
sort of social secretary, my God.

1299
01:21:27,396 --> 01:21:29,330
Goodbye,
Mr. Blomfield.

1300
01:21:40,976 --> 01:21:43,171
No, actually,
she didn't.

1301
01:21:43,946 --> 01:21:47,746
Neither about that,
nor about you and Gerry.

1302
01:21:48,817 --> 01:21:51,911
But I'm grateful for
the truth, for a change.

1303
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:30,819
Hello?

1304
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,157
Delysia?

1305
01:22:42,638 --> 01:22:44,128
Miss Lafosse?

1306
01:22:50,312 --> 01:22:52,507
MICHAEL: Come on, come on,
the taxi's waiting.

1307
01:22:53,348 --> 01:22:55,248
DELYSIA: Michael,
don't rush me!

1308
01:22:55,984 --> 01:22:59,078
Guinevere! Are you all
right? We've been so worried.

1309
01:22:59,154 --> 01:23:00,815
Perfectly well,
thank you.

1310
01:23:00,889 --> 01:23:02,426
We've been scouring London for you.

1311
01:23:02,427 --> 01:23:03,084
Miss Lafosse...

1312
01:23:03,158 --> 01:23:05,149
You have not been at the roulette
wheel all night, have you?

1313
01:23:05,227 --> 01:23:08,162
Please, Delysia,
I'm trying to apologize.

1314
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:11,825
I expect you've heard that I am
not a social secretary at all.

1315
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:14,596
I'm afraid I found
myself pretending.

1316
01:23:15,437 --> 01:23:19,806
Miss Pettigrew, if that's you
pretending, then you're jolly good at it.

1317
01:23:20,942 --> 01:23:22,068
Guinevere,

1318
01:23:22,144 --> 01:23:25,705
Sarah Grubb is not going to
judge anybody for pretending.

1319
01:23:25,781 --> 01:23:29,512
MICHAEL: Come on, Grubb! This is
us, I'm afraid, Miss Pettigrew.

1320
01:23:29,584 --> 01:23:31,518
Boat won't wait.

1321
01:23:31,586 --> 01:23:33,486
Are you really going?
- Mmm-hmm!

1322
01:23:34,356 --> 01:23:36,324
To New York?
- Yep.

1323
01:23:36,892 --> 01:23:38,382
How wonderful.

1324
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:41,224
But, Guinevere,
what will you do?

1325
01:23:41,963 --> 01:23:43,931
Don't you worry
about me, petal.

1326
01:23:43,999 --> 01:23:48,163
Why, Miss Holt is holding a job
for me this very morning, I expect.

1327
01:23:57,479 --> 01:24:00,607
I will never forget the day
we spent together.

1328
01:24:01,516 --> 01:24:02,915
Not ever.

1329
01:24:04,553 --> 01:24:05,952
Nor I.

1330
01:24:06,922 --> 01:24:08,048

1331
01:24:08,123 --> 01:24:09,385
(LAUGHING)

1332
01:24:11,893 --> 01:24:14,191
Oh, goodbye, Guinevere.
I love you.

1333
01:24:14,262 --> 01:24:16,025
Off with you. Away.

1334
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:22,434
Oh, come and visit!
New York's bopping!

1335
01:24:54,102 --> 01:24:58,334
(BELL TOLLING)

1336
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:34,774
Forgive the intrusion.

1337
01:25:37,813 --> 01:25:39,337
I'm glad to see
you're safe.

1338
01:25:39,414 --> 01:25:41,075
Oh, yes. Quite safe.

1339
01:25:47,255 --> 01:25:51,282
Am I right in thinking you're no
longer employed, Miss Pettigrew?

1340
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:52,883
Quite correct.

1341
01:25:52,961 --> 01:25:55,259
So you're free?
- Quite free.

1342
01:25:56,097 --> 01:25:59,157
Might you be looking
for a social secretary?

1343
01:25:59,234 --> 01:26:00,758
No. Absolutely not.

1344
01:26:00,969 --> 01:26:01,958
Oh.

1345
01:26:04,773 --> 01:26:06,570
I'm looking for you.

1346
01:26:08,143 --> 01:26:09,201
Me?

1347
01:26:10,212 --> 01:26:14,171
I've been looking for you
all night, and, I believe

1348
01:26:15,217 --> 01:26:16,980
all of my life.

1349
01:26:18,854 --> 01:26:20,651
If you'll have me.

1350
01:26:26,027 --> 01:26:28,860
A nod of the head
will do me fine.

1351
01:26:34,836 --> 01:26:38,203
And I am, at a stroke,
the happiest man in London.

1352
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:57,488
What a night.
- What a morning.

1353
01:26:58,627 --> 01:27:00,975
Have you eaten,
my dear Guinevere?

1354
01:27:00,976 --> 01:27:01,528
Oh, Joe,

1355
01:27:01,596 --> 01:27:05,032
I have not eaten for
a very, very long time.
