1
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,800
The hills are alive

2
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,500
With the sound of music

3
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,200
With songs they have sung

4
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,300
For a thousand years

5
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,800
The hills fill my heart

6
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,600
With the sound of music

7
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:14,000
My heart wants to sing
Every song it hears

8
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,300
My heart wants to beat like the wings
Of the birds that rise

9
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,700
From the lake to the trees

10
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,200
My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies

11
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,400
From a church on a breeze

12
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,200
To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls

13
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,900
Over stones on its way

14
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,000
To sing through the night

15
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,100
Like a lark who is learning to pray

16
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,000
I go to the hills

17
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:59,400
When my heart is lonely

18
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,600
I know I will hear

19
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,300
What I've heard before

20
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,300
My heart will be blessed

21
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:21,300
With the sound of music

22
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,500
And I'll sing...

23
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:36,700
...once more

24
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,700
Hallelujah, hallelujah

25
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,600
Hallelujah, hallelujah

26
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
-Reverend Mother.
-Sister Bernice.

27
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,800
-I simply cannot find her.
-Maria?

28
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,200
She's missing again.

29
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,500
We should've put a cowbell
around her neck.

30
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Have you tried the barn? You know
how much she adores the animals.

31
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,800
I have looked everywhere.
In all of the usual places.

32
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,300
Sister, considering it's Maria. . .

33
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,200
. . .I suggest you look in someplace
unusual.

34
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,700
Well, Reverend Mother. . .

35
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,600
. . .I hope this new infraction ends
whatever doubts. . .

36
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,100
. . .you may still have
about Maria's future here.

37
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,300
I always try to keep faith
in my doubts, Sister Berthe.

38
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,500
After all, the wool of a black sheep
is just as warm.

39
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,000
We are not talking about sheep,
black or white, Sister Margaretta.

40
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,700
Of all the candidates for
the novitiate, Maria is the least--

41
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,500
Children, children.

42
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,900
We were speculating about
the qualifications of our postulants.

43
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,500
The Mistress of Novices
and the Mistress of Postulants. . .

44
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,100
. . .were trying to help me
by expressing opposite points of view.

45
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,400
Tell me, Sister Catherine,
what do you think of Maria?

46
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,700
She's a wonderful girl,
some of the time.

47
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,700
-Sister Agatha?
-It's very easy to like Maria. . .

48
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,500
. . .except when it's difficult.

49
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,300
-And you, Sister Sophia?
-Oh, I love her very dearly.

50
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,500
But she always seems to be
in trouble, doesn't she?

51
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,500
Exactly what I say.

52
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,300
She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee

53
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,200
Her dress has got a tear

54
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,000
She waltzes on her way to Mass
And whistles on the stair

55
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,100
And underneath her wimple
She has curlers in her hair

56
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,000
I've even heard her singing
ln the abbey

57
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,300
She's always late for chapel

58
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,800
But her penitence is real

59
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,400
She's always late for everything

60
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Except for every meal

61
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,700
I hate to have to say it
But I very firmly feel

62
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,400
Maria 's not an asset to the abbey

63
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,400
I'd like to say a word in her behalf

64
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,000
Say it, Sister Margaretta.

65
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,800
Maria makes me laugh

66
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,600
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

67
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,700
How do you catch a cloud
And pin it down?

68
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,300
How do you find a word
That means Maria?

69
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,000
A flibbertigibbet

70
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,500
-A will-o '-the-wisp
-A clown

71
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,900
Many a thing you know
You'd like to tell her

72
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,600
Many a thing she ought to understand

73
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,800
But how do you make her stay
And listen to all you say?

74
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,800
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

75
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,100
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

76
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:34,200
How do you hold a moonbeam...

77
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,900
...in your hand?

78
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,500
When I'm with her I'm confused
Out of focus and bemused

79
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,200
And I never know exactly where I am

80
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,700
-Unpredictable as weather
-She's as flighty as a feather

81
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,900
-She's a darling
-She's a demon

82
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,500
She's a lamb

83
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,500
She'll out pester any pest
Drive a hornet from its nest

84
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,000
She can throw a whirling dervish
Out of whirl

85
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,100
-She is gentle, she is wild
-She's a riddle, she's a child

86
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,300
-She's a headache
-She's an angel

87
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,400
She's a girl

88
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,000
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

89
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,000
How do you catch a cloud
And pin it down?

90
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,800
How do you find a word
That means Maria?

91
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
-A flibbertigibbet
-A will-o '-the-wisp

92
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,900
A clown

93
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,100
Many a thing you know
You'd like to tell her

94
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,800
Many a thing she ought to understand

95
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,400
-But how do you make her stay
-And listen to all you say?

96
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,800
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

97
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,800
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

98
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:16,500
How do you hold a moonbeam...

99
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:23,800
...in your hand?

100
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
You may go in now, Maria.

101
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,900
Come here, my child.

102
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,800
Now sit down.

103
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,300
Reverend Mother, I'm sorry.
I couldn't help myself.

104
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,400
-The hills were beckoning and before--
-Dear.

105
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,900
I haven't summoned you for apologies.

106
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,300
Please let me ask for forgiveness.

107
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,200
If you'll feel better.

108
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,500
Yes, you see,
the sky was so blue today. . .

109
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,600
. . .and everything was so green and
fragrant, I had to be a part of it.

110
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,300
The Untersberg led me higher like
it wanted me to go through the clouds.

111
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,600
Suppose darkness had come
and you were lost?

112
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,100
Mother, I could never be lost
up there.

113
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,200
That's my mountain.
I was brought up on it.

114
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,700
It was the mountain that led me
to you.

115
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,400
When I was a child,
I would come down and climb a tree. . .

116
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,500
. . .and look in your garden.

117
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,600
I'd see the sisters at work
and hear them sing.

118
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,600
Which brings me to another
transgression, Reverend Mother.

119
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,000
I was singing out there today.

120
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Only in the abbey do we have rules
about postulants singing.

121
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,900
I can't stop wherever I am.

122
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,400
Worse, I can't seem to stop
saying things.

123
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,900
Everything I think and feel.

124
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,700
Some call that "honesty. "

125
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,200
Oh, but it's terrible,
Reverend Mother!

126
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,400
You know how Sister Berthe makes me
kiss the floor after a disagreement?

127
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,300
Lately, I kiss the floor
when I see her coming to save time.

128
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,100
Maria. . .

129
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,100
. . .when you saw us over the wall
and longed to be with us. . .

130
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,100
. . .that didn't mean you were prepared
for the way we live here, did it?

131
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,800
No, Mother, but I pray and I try.

132
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,700
And I am learning. I really am.

133
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,600
What is the most important lesson
you have learned here?

134
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,100
To find out what is the will of God
and do it wholeheartedly.

135
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,100
Maria. . .

136
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,400
. . .it seems to be God's will
that you leave us.

137
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,100
-Leave?
-Only for a while.

138
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,000
No, Mother!
Please don't send me away!

139
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,500
This is where I belong. It's my home,
my family. It's my life.

140
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,100
-Are you truly ready for it?
-Yes, I am.

141
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:09,300
If you go out into the world for a
time, knowing what we expect of you. . .

142
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,300
. . .you will find out
if you can expect it of yourself.

143
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,800
I know what you expect, Mother,
and I can do it! I promise I can!

144
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,600
Yes, Mother.

145
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,300
If it is God's will.

146
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,700
There is a family near Salzburg that
needs a governess until September.

147
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,100
-September?
-For seven children.

148
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,800
Seven children?!

149
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,300
Do you like children?

150
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,900
Well, yes, but seven!

151
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,200
I will tell Captain von Trapp
to expect you tomorrow.

152
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,100
Captain?

153
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,700
A retired officer of the lmperial
Navy. A fine man and a brave one.

154
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,600
His wife died,
and he is alone with the children.

155
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,100
I understand he has had a difficult
time keeping a governess there.

156
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,200
Why difficult, Reverend Mother?

157
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,500
The Lord will show you
in His own good time.

158
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,900
When the Lord closes a door. . .

159
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,600
. . .somewhere He opens a window.

160
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,900
What will this day be like?

161
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,400
I wonder

162
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,000
What will my future be?

163
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,100
I wonder

164
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,700
It could be so exciting

165
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,100
To be out in the world
To be free

166
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,400
My heart should be wildly rejoicing

167
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,900
Oh, what's the matter with me?

168
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,200
I've always longed for adventure

169
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,100
To do the things I've never dared

170
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,500
Now here I'm facing adventure

171
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:47,900
Then why am I so scared?

172
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,300
A captain with seven children

173
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,300
What's so fearsome about that?

174
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,500
I must stop these doubts and worries

175
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,600
If I don 't ljust know I'll turn back

176
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,000
I must dream of the things
I am seeking

177
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:15,100
I am seeking the courage I lack

178
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,900
The courage to serve them
With reliance

179
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,000
Face my mistakes without defiance

180
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,000
Show them I'm worthy

181
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,900
And while I show them

182
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,000
I'll show me

183
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,600
So let them bring on
All their problems

184
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,100
I'll do better than my best

185
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,400
I have confidence
They'll put me to the test

186
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,100
But I'll make them see
I have confidence in me

187
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,600
Somehow I will impress them

188
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,100
I will be firm but kind

189
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,700
And all those children
Heaven bless them

190
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,200
They will look up to me
And mind me

191
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,600
With each step I am more certain

192
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,100
Everything will turn out fine

193
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,400
I have confidence
The world can all be mine

194
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:18,100
They'll have to agree
I have confidence in me

195
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,400
I have confidence in sunshine

196
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,800
I have confidence in rain

197
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,900
I have confidence
That spring will come again

198
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,200
Besides which you see
I have confidence in me

199
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,600
Strength doesn 't lie in numbers

200
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,900
Strength doesn 't lie in wealth

201
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,400
Strength lies in nights
Ofpeaceful slumbers

202
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,600
When you wake up, wake up
It's healthy

203
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,900
All I trust I leave my heart to

204
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,000
All I trust becomes my own

205
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:57,000
I have confidence in confidence alone

206
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,300
Oh, help.

207
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:32,200
I have confidence in confidence alone

208
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,800
Besides which you see
I have confidence...

209
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,800
...in me

210
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,800
Hello. Here I am.

211
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,400
I'm from the convent.
I'm the new governess, captain.

212
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,400
And I'm the old butler, fräulein.

213
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,100
Well, how do you do?

214
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,700
You'll wait here, please.

215
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,200
In future, remember certain rooms
in this house are not to be disturbed.

216
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,800
Yes, captain, sir.

217
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,900
-Why do you stare at me that way?
-You don't look like a sea captain.

218
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,200
I'm afraid you don't look
very much like a governess.

219
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,000
-Turn around.
-What?

220
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,600
Turn.

221
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,000
Hat off.

222
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,800
Put on another dress
before meeting the children.

223
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,700
But I don't have another.

224
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,800
When we enter the abbey,
our worldly clothes go to the poor.

225
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,300
What about this one?

226
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,800
The poor didn't want it.

227
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,200
There wasn't time to make a new dress.
I can make clothes.

228
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,700
I'll see that you get some material.

229
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,000
Today, if possible.

230
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,700
-Now, fräulein. . . .
-Maria.

231
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,700
I don't know how much
the abbess told you.

232
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,500
You are the twelfth governess. . .

233
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,200
. . .to look after my children
since their mother died.

234
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,600
I trust you will be an improvement
on the last one.

235
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,700
She stayed only two hours.

236
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,000
What's wrong with the children, sir?

237
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,800
Nothing is wrong with the children,
only the governesses.

238
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,100
They could not maintain discipline,
without which the house cannot be run.

239
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,800
Drill them in their studies.

240
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,600
I will not permit them to dream
away their summer holidays.

241
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,500
Each afternoon,
they march, breathing deeply.

242
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,400
Bedtime is to be strictly observed.

243
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,600
When do they play?

244
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,800
You will see to it that they conduct
themselves with the utmost decorum.

245
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,000
-I am placing you in command.
-Yes, sir.

246
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,800
Now. . .

247
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,400
. . .this is your new governess,
Fräulein Maria.

248
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Give your name at your signal.

249
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,500
Fräulein, listen carefully. Learn
their signals so you can call them.

250
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,200
Liesl.

251
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,200
Friedrich.

252
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,000
Louisa.

253
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,500
Kurt.

254
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
Brigitta.

255
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,300
Marta.

256
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,100
Gretl.

257
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,100
Now, let's see how well you listened.

258
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,700
I won't need to whistle for them,
Reverend Captain.

259
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,400
I mean, I'll use their names.
Such lovely names.

260
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,800
Fräulein, this is a large house.
The grounds are extensive.

261
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,800
And I will not have anyone shouting.

262
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,800
You will take this, please.
Learn to use it.

263
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,700
The children will help you.

264
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,700
Now, when I want you,
this is what you will hear.

265
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,400
Oh, no, sir. I'm sorry, sir!

266
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,800
I could never answer to a whistle.

267
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,600
Whistles are for animals,
not for children.

268
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,900
And definitely not for me.

269
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,900
It would be too humiliating.

270
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,900
Fräulein, were you this much trouble
at the abbey?

271
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,300
Oh, much more, sir.

272
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,000
I don't know your signal.

273
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,000
You may call me "captain. "

274
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,400
At ease.

275
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,800
Now that there's just us. . .

276
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,200
. . .would you please tell me all your
names again and how old you are.

277
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,700
I'm Liesl. I'm 1 6 years old,
and I don't need a governess.

278
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,500
I'm glad you told me, Liesl.
We'll just be good friends.

279
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,500
I'm Friedrich. I'm 1 4.
I'm impossible.

280
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,500
Really? Who told you that, Friedrich?

281
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,200
Fräulein Josephine.
Four governesses ago.

282
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,100
I'm Brigitta.

283
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,900
You didn't tell me how old you are,
Louisa.

284
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,900
I'm Brigitta. She's Louisa.

285
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,900
She's 1 3 years old, and you're smart.

286
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,900
I'm 1 0, and I think your dress
is the ugliest one I ever saw.

287
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,900
-Brigitta, you shouldn't say that.
-Why not?

288
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,400
-Don't you think it's ugly?
-Of course.

289
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,300
But Fräulein Helga's was ugliest.

290
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,200
I'm Kurt. I'm 1 1 .
I'm incorrigible.

291
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,600
-Congratulations.
-What's "incorrigible"?

292
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,700
I think it means you want
to be treated like a boy.

293
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,200
I'm Marta, and I'm going to be
seven on Tuesday.

294
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,800
I'd like a pink parasol.

295
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,500
Pink's my favorite color too.

296
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,100
Yes, you're Gretl.

297
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,700
And you're five years old?

298
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,100
My, you're practically a lady.

299
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,700
I have to tell you a secret.
I've never been a governess.

300
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,900
You don't know anything
about being a governess?

301
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,500
Nothing. I'll need lots of advice.

302
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:31,000
The best way to start is to tell
Father to mind his own business.

303
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,000
Never come to dinner on time.

304
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,500
Never eat your soup quietly.

305
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,300
During dessert, always blow your nose.

306
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,300
Don't you believe a word they say,
Fräulein Maria.

307
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,900
-Oh, why not?
-Because I like you.

308
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,700
Children, outside for your walk.

309
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,800
Father's orders. Hurry up.

310
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,300
Quick, quick, quick.

311
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,800
Fräulein Maria, I'm Frau Schmidt,
the housekeeper.

312
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
How do you do.

313
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,100
I'll show you to your room.
Follow me.

314
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,000
Poor little dears.

315
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:29,000
You're very lucky. With
Fräulein Helga it was a snake.

316
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,300
Good evening.

317
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,300
-Good evening, children.
-Good evening, Fräulein Maria.

318
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,100
Enchanting little ritual.

319
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,000
Something you learned at the abbey?

320
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,500
No.

321
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,500
Rheumatism.

322
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,400
Excuse me, captain. Haven't we
forgotten to thank the Lord?

323
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,700
For what we receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

324
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,100
-Amen.
-Amen.

325
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,600
I'd like to thank you all. . .

326
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,800
. . .for the precious gift
you left in my pocket today.

327
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,100
What gift?

328
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,400
It's a secret between
the children and me.

329
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,300
Then I suggest you keep it,
and let us eat.

330
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,600
Knowing how nervous
I must have been. . .

331
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,300
. . .a stranger in a new household. . .

332
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,600
. . .knowing how important it was
for me to feel accepted. . .

333
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,000
. . .it was so kind and thoughtful of
you to make my first moments here. . .

334
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,400
. . .so warm and happy. . .

335
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,400
. . .and pleasant.

336
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,700
-What is the matter, Marta?
-Nothing.

337
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,200
Fräulein. . .

338
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,300
. . .is it to be at every meal
or merely at dinnertime. . .

339
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:49,100
. . .that you intend leading us through
this rare and wonderful new world. . .

340
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,900
. . .of indigestion?

341
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,300
They're all right, captain.
They're just happy.

342
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,800
-Rolf, good evening.
-Good evening, Franz.

343
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,800
-I trust everything is under control?
-Yes, yes.

344
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,800
-Are there any developments?
-Perhaps.

345
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,200
-Is the captain home?
-He's at dinner.

346
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,800
-With the family?
-Yes.

347
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,800
Give him this telegram at once.

348
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,600
Certainly.

349
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,100
A telegram for you, sir.

350
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,700
Franz? Who delivered it?

351
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,100
That young lad Rolf, of course.

352
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,200
Father, may I be excused?

353
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,600
Children, in the morning I shall
be going to Vienna.

354
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,300
Not again, Father!

355
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,300
How long will you be gone this time?

356
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,400
I'm not sure, Gretl.

357
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,200
-To visit Baroness Schraeder again?
-Mind your own business!

358
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,100
As a matter of fact, yes, Louisa.

359
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,700
-Why can't we ever see the baroness?
-Why would she want to see you?

360
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,900
You are going to see the baroness.
I'm bringing her back with me to visit.

361
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,100
And Uncle Max.

362
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,800
Uncle Max!

363
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,200
Rolf!

364
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,300
Oh, Rolf!

365
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,800
-No, Liesl. We mustn't!
-Why not, silly?

366
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,700
-I don't know--
-Isn't this why you're waiting?

367
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,800
Yes, of course.

368
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,800
-I've missed you, Liesl.
-You have? How much?

369
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,900
I even thought of sending a telegram,
so I'd be able to deliver it here.

370
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,000
Oh, that's a lovely thought!
Why don't you, right now?

371
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,500
-But I'm here!
-Please, Rolf. Send me a telegram.

372
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,200
I'll start it for you.
"Dear Liesl. . . . "

373
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,500
"Dear Liesl: I'd like to be able
to tell you. . .

374
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,900
. . .how I feel about you. Stop.

375
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:39,700
Unfortunately, this wire
is already too expensive.

376
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,300
Sincerely, Rolf. "

377
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,300
-"Sincerely"?
-Cordially.

378
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,200
-"Cordially"?
-Affectionately?

379
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
Will there be any reply?

380
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,000
"Dear Rolf: Stop.

381
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,100
Don't stop! Your Liesl. "

382
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,700
If only we didn't have to wait
for someone to send Father a telegram.

383
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,300
How do I know when I'll see you again?

384
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,500
Well, let's see. . . .

385
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,400
I could come here by mistake.

386
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,100
With a telegram for Colonel Schneider!
He's here from Berlin staying with--

387
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,300
No one knows he's here.
Don't tell your father.

388
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,700
-Why not?
-Your father's so Austrian.

389
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,200
We're all Austrian.

390
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,800
Some think we ought to be German, and
they're very mad at those who don't.

391
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,800
They're getting ready to--

392
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,900
Let's hope your father
doesn't get into trouble.

393
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:45,100
Don't worry. He's a big naval hero.
He was even decorated by the emperor.

394
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,600
I don't worry about him.
I worry about his daughter.

395
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,600
Me? Why?

396
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,500
-Well, you're so--
-What?

397
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,400
You're such a baby!

398
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,700
I'm 1 6.
What's such a baby about that?

399
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,500
You wait, little girl
On an empty stage

400
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,100
For fate to turn the light on

401
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,000
Your life, little girl
ls an empty page

402
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,300
That men will want to write on

403
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,500
To write on

404
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,400
You are 16 going on 17

405
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,400
Baby, it's time to think

406
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,300
Better beware
Be canny and careful

407
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,100
Baby, you're on the brink

408
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,300
You are 16 going on 17

409
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,100
Fellows will fall in line

410
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,800
Eager young lads
And roués and cads

411
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,900
Will offer you food and wine

412
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,000
Totally unprepared are you

413
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,000
To face a world of men

414
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,700
Timid and shy and scared are you

415
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,500
Of things beyond your ken

416
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,600
You need someone older and wiser

417
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,700
Telling you what to do

418
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,400
I am 17 going on 18

419
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:28,600
I'll take care of you

420
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,400
I am 16 going on 17

421
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,000
I know that I'm naive

422
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,500
Fellows I meet
May tell me I'm sweet

423
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,500
And willingly I believe

424
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,100
I am 16 going on 17

425
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,100
Innocent as a rose

426
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,700
Bachelor dandies
Drinkers of brandies

427
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,300
What do I know of those?

428
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,100
Totally unprepared am I

429
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,800
To face a world of men

430
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,600
Timid and shy and scared am I

431
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,600
Of things beyond my ken

432
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,600
I need someone older and wiser

433
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,100
Telling me what to do

434
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,200
You are 17 going on 18

435
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:03,100
I'll depend on you

436
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,500
Come in.

437
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,200
Frau Schmidt.

438
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,300
For your new dresses.

439
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,600
-The captain had these sent from town.
-Oh, how lovely!

440
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,300
These will make the prettiest
clothes I've ever had.

441
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,100
Do you think he would
get me more material if I asked?

442
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,000
-How many dresses do you need?
-Not for me, for the children.

443
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,300
I want to make them some play clothes.

444
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,100
The von Trapp children don't play.
They march.

445
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,000
Surely you don't approve of that.

446
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,400
Ever since the captain
lost his poor wife. . .

447
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,400
. . .he runs this house as if on
one of his ships.

448
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,600
Whistles, orders.

449
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,700
No more music, no more laughing.

450
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,400
Nothing that reminds him of her.
Even the children.

451
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,100
But that's so wrong.

452
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,400
Oh, well.

453
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,300
How do you like your room?
There'll be new drapes at the windows.

454
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,800
Bu these are fine.

455
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,700
New ones have been ordered.

456
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,200
-But I really don't need them.
-Good night, now.

457
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,500
Frau Schmidt, if I asked
the captain about the material. . .?

458
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,200
-He's leaving in the morning.
-Of course. How long will he be gone?

459
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,400
It depends. The last time he visited
the baroness, he stayed for a month.

460
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:18,200
I shouldn't be saying this to you.
I don't know you that well.

461
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,400
But if you ask me,
the captain's thinking seriously. . .

462
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,800
. . .of marrying her before
summer's over.

463
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,300
Wonderful! The children will
have a mother again.

464
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,000
Yes.

465
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,000
Well, good night.

466
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,700
Good night.

467
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,900
Dear Father, now I know
why You sent me here.

468
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,000
To help these children
prepare for a new mother.

469
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,600
And I pray this will become
a happy family in Thy sight.

470
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,900
God bless the captain.
God bless Liesl and Friedrich.

471
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:09,300
God bless Louisa, Brigitta,
Marta and little Gretl.

472
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,400
And I forgot the other boy.
What's his name?

473
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,000
Well, God bless what's-his-name.

474
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,200
God bless the Reverend Mother
and Sister Margaretta. . .

475
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,200
. . .and everybody at the abbey.

476
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,000
And now, dear God, about Liesl.

477
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,300
Help her know that I'm her friend. . .

478
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,100
. . .and help her tell me
what she's been up to.

479
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,000
Are you going to tell on me?

480
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,700
Help me to be understanding
so I may guide her footsteps.

481
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,600
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

482
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,800
I was out walking
and somebody locked the doors early.

483
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,700
I didn't want to wake everybody,
so when I saw your window open. . . .

484
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,400
You're not going to tell Father,
are you?

485
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,800
How did you climb up?

486
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:01,400
It's how we always got in
to play tricks on the governess.

487
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,600
Louisa can make it with
a whole jar of spiders in her hand.

488
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,300
Spiders?

489
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,600
Were you out walking all by yourself?

490
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:24,800
If we wash that dress tonight,
nobody would notice it tomorrow.

491
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,300
You could put this on.

492
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,700
Take your dress and put it
to soak in the bathtub.

493
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,400
Come back here and sit on the bed,
and we'll have a talk.

494
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,800
I told you today
I didn't need a governess.

495
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,100
Well, maybe I do.

496
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,100
Gretl, are you scared?

497
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,900
You're not frightened
of a storm, are you?

498
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,400
You just stay right here with me.

499
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,800
-Where are the others?
-They're asleep. They're not scared.

500
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,000
Oh, no? Look.

501
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,600
All right, up here on the bed.

502
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,600
-Really?
-Well, just this once. Come on.

503
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:47,000
-Now we'll wait for the boys.
-You won't see them. Boys are brave.

504
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,900
You weren't scared, were you?

505
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,600
Oh, no. We just wanted
to be sure that you weren't.

506
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,700
-That's very thoughtful of you.
-It wasn't my idea.

507
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,800
It was Kurt's!

508
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,700
Kurt! That's the one I left out!
God bless Kurt.

509
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,300
Why does it do that?

510
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:16,300
The lightning talks to the thunder,
and the thunder answers.

511
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,100
-But lightning must be nasty.
-Not really.

512
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,600
Why does the thunder get so angry?

513
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,100
It makes me want to cry.

514
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:30,100
Whenever I'm feeling unhappy,
I just try to think of nice things.

515
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,100
What kind of things?

516
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,900
Well, let me see. Nice things. . . .

517
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,100
Daffodils.

518
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,900
Green meadows.

519
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,500
Skies full of stars.

520
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,900
Raindrops on roses
and whiskers on kittens

521
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,300
Bright copper kettles
And warm woolen mittens

522
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,700
Brown paper packages
Tied up with strings

523
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,900
These are a few of my favorite things

524
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,300
Cream-colored ponies
And crisp apple strudels

525
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,800
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And schnitzel with noodles

526
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,900
Wild geese that fly
With the moon on their wings

527
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,000
These are a few of my favorite things

528
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,000
Girls in white dresses
With blue satin sashes

529
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,500
Snowflakes that stay
On my nose and eyelashes

530
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,800
Silver white winters
That melt into springs

531
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,400
These are a few of my favorite things

532
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,300
When the dog bites

533
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,200
When the bee stings

534
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,700
When I'm feeling sad

535
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,400
I simply remember my favorite things

536
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:43,500
And then I don 't feel so bad

537
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,900
-Does it work?
-Of course.

538
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,100
-What do you like?
-Pussy willow!

539
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,100
-Christmas!
-Bunny rabbits!

540
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,900
Snakes!

541
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,400
-Chocolate icing!
-No school!

542
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,800
Pillow fights!

543
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,100
-Telegrams!
-Birthday presents!

544
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,800
-Any presents!
-Ladybugs!

545
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,700
A good sneeze!

546
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,700
Gesundheit!

547
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,200
See what fun it is?

548
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,400
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

549
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,500
Bright copper kettles
And warm woolen mittens

550
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,800
Brown paper packages
Tied up with strings

551
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,900
These are a few of my favorite things

552
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,100
Cream-colored ponies
And crisp apple strudels

553
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,300
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And schnitzel with noodles

554
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,400
Wild geese that fly
With the moon on their wings

555
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:37,200
These are a few of my favorite things

556
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,600
Together.

557
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,700
Girls in white dresses
With blue satin sashes

558
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,800
Snowflakes that stay
On my nose and eyelashes

559
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,100
Silver white winters
That melt into springs

560
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,600
These are a few of my favorite things

561
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,000
When the dog bi--

562
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,200
Dog bites.

563
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,100
Hello.

564
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:09,500
Fräulein, did I not tell you that
bedtime is to be strictly observed?

565
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,500
The children were upset
by the storm, so l--

566
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,800
You did, sir.

567
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:19,300
Do you, or do you not, have difficulty
remembering such simple instructions?

568
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,200
Only during thunderstorms.

569
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,200
Liesl?

570
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,700
I don't recall seeing you
after dinner.

571
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,000
Really? As a matter of fact--

572
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,400
Yes?

573
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,400
Well, I was--

574
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,800
What she would like to say. . .

575
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,800
. . .is that she and I have
been getting acquainted tonight.

576
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:44,900
It's too late to go into that. You
heard your father. Go back to bed.

577
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,000
Fräulein. . .

578
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,300
. . .you have managed to remember
I'm leaving in the morning?

579
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,000
Is it also possible you remember the
first rule in this house is discipline?

580
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,100
Then I trust that before I return. . .

581
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,400
. . .you'll have acquired some?

582
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,200
Captain?

583
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:15,000
Could I talk to you about clothes
for the children for when they play?

584
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,000
-If I could have some material.
-You are many things.

585
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,400
Not the least of which is repetitious.

586
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,800
-But they're children!
-Yes.

587
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,800
And I'm their father.

588
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,600
Good night.

589
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:56,700
Girls in white dresses
With blue satin sashes

590
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,700
When the dog bites
When the bee stings

591
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,400
When I'm feeling sad

592
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:18,000
I simply remember my favorite things

593
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,300
And then I don 't feel...

594
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:27,500
...so bad

595
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,200
Children, over here. See!

596
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,200
Come on.

597
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,500
Fräulein Maria?

598
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,700
Can we do this every day?

599
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:29,100
-Don't you think you'd get tired of it?
-I suppose so.

600
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,800
Every other day?

601
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,600
I haven't had so much fun since we put
glue on Fräulein Josephine's toothbrush.

602
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,700
I can't understand how children
as nice as you can play such tricks.

603
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,800
-It's easy.
-But why do it?

604
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,400
How else can we get
Father's attention?

605
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,800
Oh, I see.

606
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,400
We'll have to think about that one.

607
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,200
All right, over here.

608
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,800
What are we going to do?

609
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Think of a song for the baroness.

610
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,200
Father doesn't like us to sing.

611
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,200
Perhaps we can change his mind.
Now, what songs do you know?

612
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:03,300
END OF CD1
