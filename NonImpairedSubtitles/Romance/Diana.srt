He doesn't treat me like a princess.

178

you improvise.

197

You look at someone for a clue
as how to start the conversation

198
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,768

You improvise all the time.

And if you can improvise,
you'll like jazz.

Why?

904
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:52,121
Because if I marry you, I have to
marry the whole world as well.

905
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,802
We can't simply be
a man and a woman.

But you must have known
that from the start.

When you fall in love, you just
keep going despite warning lights.

01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,249
That's not true.

how I could marry the most
famous woman in the world.

911
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,922
But I'd be giving up the very
thing that defines me.

912
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:19,090
I want to make it work.
I can't stop loving you.

913

when they're saying goodbye.

I'll give him that.

- Why not? You belong with him now.

You're on the list labelled
"the past". Aren't you?

01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,485
I don't want to see it like that.

919
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:43,084
Then why call me in the middle of
the night to this godforsaken park

920
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:46,130
- to give me my marching orders?
- That's a bit dramatic.

921
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:51,121
Dramatic? Dramatic.
My whole life has been dramatic.

922
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,571
It's been full of the sound
of people shutting doors on me.
