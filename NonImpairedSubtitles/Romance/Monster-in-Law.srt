1
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:37,968
You thought you had
found a good girl

2
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:41,633
One to love you
and give you the world

3
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:45,701
Now you find
that you´ve been misused

4
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,612
Talk to me,
l´ll do what you choose

5
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,206
l want you to

6
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,115
Tell Mama

7
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,279
All about it

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,481
Tell Mama

9
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,286
What you need

10
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,121
Tell Mama

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,628
What you want

12
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:06,029
And l´ll make everything
all right

13
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,331
That girl you had
didn´t have no sense

14
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:13,999
She wasn´t worth
all the time that you spent

15
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,840
She had another man
throw you outdoors

16
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,971
Now the same man
is wearing your clothes

17
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,983
l want you
to tell Mama

18
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,042
Tell Mama

19
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,213
What you want

20
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,122
And l´ll make everything
all right...

21
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,258
Hi, it´s Charlie.
Leave a message.

22
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,596
Hi, Charlie. lt´s Carol

00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:48,865
Good morning, neighbor.

26
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,638
Hey.
Help yourself.

27
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,202
Oh, thanks.
l was out of everything.

28
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,804
Aw, why do l even bother?

29
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,476
You know, Remy, l gave you
that key for emergencies.

30
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,212
Extreme emergencies.

31
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,085
lt was.
l needed caffeine.

32
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,148
l don´t know.
This is good. l´d even wear it.

33
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,751
Good, ´cause l´ve got to go.
l´m late for my first client.

34
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,785
But you stay,
have breakfast, take a shower.

35
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,820
Go through my drawers.

36
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,833
Tell Mama

37
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,835
All about it

38
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,030
Tell Mama

39
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,096
What you want

40
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,472
Tell Mama...

41
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,342
- Hey, Charlie.
- Morning.

42
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,347
- Are the boys ready?
- Dragon! Zorro!

43
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,946
Hey!
There are my boys.

44
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,510
Come on. Yay.

45
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,579
- See you later!
- Bye!

46
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,990
- Be good, boys!
- Whoa! Slow down!

47
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,051
Tell Mama
all about it

48
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:46,862
Tell Mama
what you need...

49
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,199
´´Romance is in the air today.

50
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,534
No one can resist
your obvious charms.´´

51
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:58,838
Well, Otis, your horoscope
seems accurate.

52
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,675
Stop it.
Come on.

53
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,806
Let´s read mine.
Okay.

54
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,250
´´Do not leave your house today.´´
Too late.

55
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:10,017
´´And stop looking so hard.
Love is right in front of you.´´

56
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,353
Hey.
What´s wrong?

57
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,610
l ordered a nonfat latte.
l can taste the fat.

58
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,384
l would be happy
to change it for you, sir.

59
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,654
Can´t you even make a friggin´ cup
of coffee? l can taste the fat.

60
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,287
How hard it is to make
a friggin´ cup of coffee?

61
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,160
l can make another one
for you if you´d like. l´d be happy

62
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,256
- to exchange it for you, sir.
- Hello? lt´s okay.

63
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,291
- You´ve done enough, thanks.
- l´m sorry.

64
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,201
Karma.

65
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,072
- Have a good one.
- Thanks, girl!

66
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:09,343
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, l´m sorry.

67
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,949
Hi.

68
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,478
Hi.

69
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,655
l don´t know how
to read tarot cards.

70
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,028
- Why am l in the cards?
- Come on, just try.

71
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:29,034
Okay, well, this crazy old lady
keeps coming up.

72
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,832
The knight
in shining armor.

73
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,998
- Mmm! That´s mine.
- No no no. What?

74
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,668
- l saw this guy twice today.
- That guy?

75
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,768
Two times in one day.
That´s got to be a sign, right?

76
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,711
Mm, a sign.

77
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,807
Yeah, okay. What did he say
when you talked to him?

78
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,250
l didn´t talk to him.

79
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,488
Well, are you sure
he saw you?

80
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,891
Yeah!
l mean, l think so.

81
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,895
Okay, honey,
we´re worried about you

82
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,897
because you´re turning
into a little bit of a freak.

83
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,456
Yeah, we think
it´s from not having sex.

84
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,197
- Exactly.
- Look, just because...

85
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,205
l haven´t been in
a relationship in a while

86
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,104
doesn´t mean
l´m miserable.

87
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,769
l just want a sweet guy,

88
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,712
you know, a guy
who´s strong but still...

89
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:17,215
...opens a door
once in a while.

90
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,219
and who notices
things and...

91
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,814
you know, maybe
makes a difference.

92
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:28,350
Maybe he completes you.

93
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:30,753
Oh.

94
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,061
You complete me.

95
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,365
Oh, sorry.

96
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:40,701
Dr. Batel´s office.
Hi, Mrs. Reynolds.

97
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,708
- Go to Grandma´s, tell her
l´ll be home late.

98
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,302
- l still have stitches to do...
- Yeah, can you please hold?

99
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,903
l´ll see you
at home.

100
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,039
You know what? You go ahead.
l can do that for you.

101
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,176
- Oh thank you, Charlie. You´re a doll.
- No problem.

102
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,243
Hey, George.

103
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,346
- How´re you doing, Charlie?
- Good.

104
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,323
- What do you got there?
- The doctor asked me

105
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,189
to bring it from home.

106
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,795
Whew! Okay!

107
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,822
All right. The doctor
will be right with you.

108
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:22,071
l said ´´Leap into
my arms, babe´´

109
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,879
- Thank you.
-  Come on, dive into the stove...

110
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,545
We´re here!

111
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,179
Thank God
you guys are here.

112
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,019
l am down two girls
tonight. Here.

113
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,025
- Sorry, that´s all l got left.
- Sweet.

114
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,756
Wow. You know, l love that l am
now comfortable enough with my sexuality

115
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,991
- to wear something like this, you know?
- Looks good on you.

116
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,658
- Hey, what´s up?
- Take off the apron now.

117
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,497
- Sorry.
- Where do we start?

118
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,333
Okay, uh, hand out
these shrimp balls.

119
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,498
There has got to be
a better name for those.

120
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,270
- l don´t think it´s that bad of a name.
- What´s wrong with the name?

121
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:55,076
l said, l say,
sometimes we look back...

122
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,412
- Oh my God, that´s him.
- Whoa! Who? Who?

123
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,815
The guy l ran into.
He´s here.

124
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,751
- Where?
- What?

125
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,812
That is three times in two days.
What are the chances of that?

126
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,517
- Um, like, none.
- That´s Dr. Fields.

127
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,890
This is his party. He just moved
back from San Francisco.

128
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,394
- Really?
- Yeah.

129
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,262
Well, you´re right.
He is hot.

130
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:16,291
Flirting
with disaster

131
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:20,704
You´re the one
l´m after

132
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,507
l think l´ve found
my destiny

133
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,380
l can fly

134
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,907
On the wings
of my heart

135
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,647
Deep inside

136
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,882
l´ve been falling apart

137
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,447
L-l-love

138
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,085
There´s a magic in you

139
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,527
And l´ll be

140
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,191
-  Under your spell...
- Here´s the best part.

141
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,132
The guy then goes
into cardiac arrest,

142
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,795
Kevin performs CPR
on the guy,

143
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,305
saves his life again.

144
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,001
God.
Disgusting, isn´t he?

145
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:00,035
No, you are amazing.

146
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,104
Yeah.

147
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,681
Excuse me?

148
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,780
W-wait wait wait.
What do we have there?

149
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,088
Oh, um, balls.

150
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,287
Uh, shrimp balls.

151
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,593
Um, shrimp in...

152
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,099
...balls.

153
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,930
l´m sorry,

154
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,063
but we´re not really
into fish genitalia.

155
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,575
Yeah, okay.

156
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,372
Was she really listening
to our conversation?

157
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,638
Excuse me.

158
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,782
Wait a second.

159
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,752
Um, so l know two things
about you-- you work in catering,

160
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:42,720
and you have a lot of dogs.

161
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,916
Oh, that-- no.

162
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,549
Uh, l´m a dog walker.

163
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,584
l´m not some crazy dog-lady
with 1 2,000 dogs.

164
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,257
- That´s why.
- And l´m sorry about before.

165
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,266
l didn´t mean
to be eavesdropping.

166
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,927
Well, you´re right.
You shouldn´t have.

167
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:59,062
You should have stayed
and talked to me.

168
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,630
Well, your girlfriend
seemed pretty offended.

169
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,108
Oh no, that´s--
that´s not my girlfriend.

170
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,111
l-l don´t have a--
l´m sing--

171
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,272
l don´t have
a girlfriend.

172
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,248
What?

173
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,274
Nothing.

174
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,685
Nothing. Um, l´m Charlie.
Charlotte, but Charlie.

175
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,951
Well, l´m-- l´m Kevin.

176
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,652
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

177
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,253
Uh-oh.

178
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:27,232
What? What does
´´uh-oh´´ mean?

179
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,530
lt looks like someone else
is mowing your lawn, Fiona.

180
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,059
l´m gonna go
destroy these.

181
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,970
Excuse me.
l´ll see you guys.

182
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:46,082
Oh, my shoes
are killing me

183
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:49,212
which means
they must look fabulous.

184
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,951
Can l get you anything?

185
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,858
One of him on a platter.

186
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,691
Such a waste.

187
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,663
What´s a waste?

188
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,292
Oh, you didn´t know?

189
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,303
Kevin´s gay.

190
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,431
- What?
- Yeah.

191
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,236
That´s Kit, the groom.

192
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,766
Or maybe he´s the bride.
l can´t remember

193
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,609
which one´s the top
and which one´s the bottom.

194
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,445
Yeah, they´re getting married
next Christmas in Maui.

195
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,384
l didn´t get that vibe.

196
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,286
Trust me.

197
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,188
Thanks.

198
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,293
Look at
that dude´s arms!

199
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,029
l used to have
such good gaydar.

200
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,555
Oh, you´re home.
Thank God.

201
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,997
- l´m exhausted.
- What did you do today?

202
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,934
- Hi, it´s Charlie. Leave a message.
- Went to the post office.

203
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,834
Uh, hi, Charlie.

204
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,702
- This is Kevin Fields.
- That´s him.

205
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,640
l don´t know if you remember me
from the party the other night,

206
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,339
but l was just calling,
uh, to see if, um,

207
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:23,576
maybe... maybe you wanted
to walk my dog.

208
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,174
What? No!

209
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,980
Hang up the phone.

210
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,011
No, actually, you can´t,
because l don´t have a dog.

211
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,923
So maybe you could
walk me.

212
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,194
Hang it up.

213
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,198
All right, you know,
l´m-l´m gonna go now.

214
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:44,362
Call me at 555-0118
and ask for Dr. Fields.

215
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,371
Okay, thanks. Bye.

216
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,771
Oh man, that was--
that was horrible.

217
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,538
Yeah, l wouldn´t hold your breath
for a callback on that.

218
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,068
Yeah, she´ll call me back
if she wants to walk an idiot.

219
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,808
Yeah, l´m not going
to disagree with you.

220
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,320
So takeout
or raid your fridge?

221
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,254
Here we go.

222
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,526
Take it easy, Lilly.

223
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,192
Easy.

224
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,141
Hi.

225
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,542
You never called me back so l figured
l would bring the coffee to you.

226
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,843
Thanks.

227
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:32,442
Um, look, l think you´re
a really nice guy and everything,

228
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,817
but l don´t know why
you called me.

229
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,685
- Hmm?
- l´m a woman.

230
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,952
Yeah, l love that fact.

231
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,052
Have you ever been
with a woman?

232
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,587
Excuse me?

233
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,066
l mean, have you only
ever been with men?

234
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,659
Men?
What are you talking--

235
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,728
whoa whoa whoa.
Wait a minute, l´m not gay.

236
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,070
- You´re not?
- No.

237
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,201
No, l like women.
Lots of-- no, not lots of women,

238
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,905
but you know what l mean.

239
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,913
Why did you think
l was gay?

240
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,743
Awkward.

241
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,309
Okay, l got to go now.

242
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,378
Wait wait.
Wait wait wait.

243
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,548
Okay, l´ll prove to you
that l´m not gay.

244
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,491
Let me take you out on Friday night.
We´ll watch the playoffs,

245
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,825
l´ll order a pizza,
l´ll completely ignore you.

246
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,491
Give me one good reason.

247
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,663
´Cause l´m different.

248
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,364
Really?

249
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,270
Okay, what color
are my eyes?

250
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,745
Well, at first glance,
your eyes are brown.

251
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:37,408
But when the light hits them
they change to amber.

252
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:41,078
And if you look really closely around the
iris the color is pure honey.

253
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,416
But when you look
into the sun

254
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,857
they almost look green.

255
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,884
That´s my favorite.

256
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,267
How did l do?

257
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,000
l would´ve settled
for brown.

258
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,669
- Okay!
- Peanut, let go!

259
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,836
Off! Off!

260
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,540
l´m sorry he bit you.

261
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,049
l mean, they all have their shots
so it should be fine.

262
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,813
Seriously, don´t worry about it.
lt barely broke the skin.

263
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,912
- Outside.
- Did you just move in or something?

264
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,389
No, l´ve been here
a year and a half.

265
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,119
Oh, nice place.

266
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,560
l should have some hydrogen peroxide
around here somewhere.

267
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,223
What is all this stuff?

268
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,357
Oh, l´m a yoga instructor.

269
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,697
- This?
- And a Little League coach.

270
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,396
And a dog walker
and a caterer.

271
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,405
l told you l´m a temp.

272
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,964
That is not true.
She is an incredibly talented artist.

273
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,340
- Remy! Remy!
- l mean, look at her sketchbook.

274
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,969
- She hides it right under there.
- Remy!

275
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,139
What?

276
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,172
He´s not...

277
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,151
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

278
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,425
Found it!

279
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,760
So you´re an artist, too?

280
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:02,995
Uh, l like to dabble
in a lot of different things.

281
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:06,027
l mean, life´s too short
to live the same day twice, right?

282
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,096
Yeah. That´s a good
philosophy to live by.

283
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,404
My dad always used
to say that. Come on.

284
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,104
- Used to?
- Oh, yeah,

285
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,613
- my parents died when l was little.
- Oh, l´m sorry.

286
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:18,082
That´s okay.
lt was a really long time ago.

287
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,176
- You ready?
- Yeah-- l mean,

288
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,210
it´s a little embarrassing.
l´m the doctor.

289
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,484
l´m the one who´s supposed
to look at the-- ah! Ow!

290
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,718
- Oh my God. l´m sorry!
- l´m just kidding.

291
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,283
l never get to do that.

292
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,219
Okay, because the cut is,
like, three inches higher.

293
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,291
Sorry.

294
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,802
- Do you need my phone?
- Oh, no thanks.

295
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:41,135
lt´s just my mom. And it´s only
her second page of the day.

296
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,970
She´s just getting started.

297
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,476
- Well, you´re all set.
- Thank you.

298
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,614
So, do you think, uh...

299
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:53,015
we could do this again sometime,
maybe without the biting?

300
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,486
Yeah, that would be nice.

301
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,019
- Heard from Kevin yet?
- Not yet. l´ve paged him.

302
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,551
Would you page
him again?

303
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,426
- Good morning, Stan.
- Good morning.

304
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,365
- You´re in a good mood.
- The last time the network executives

305
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,994
came to my dressing room
l got my own show and a big fat raise.

306
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:14,733
- Yeah and l had to start kissing your--
- Viola Fields? Oh my God!

307
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:17,674
lt is such an honor
to meet you.

308
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,268
Oh thank you, darling.

309
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,438
Would you mind
just signing this autograph?

310
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,472
For my grandmother.

311
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,079
l´d love to.

312
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,088
You know what else
l´d love?

313
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,818
l´d love you to get me a latte.
Do you mind?

314
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,088
- Okay.
- Thanks, hon.

315
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,391
Hi, guys.
How are you?

316
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,793
That woman is a legend.

317
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,269
Shouldn´t you be
getting the latte?

318
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,795
l just can´t believe
they picked me to replace her.

319
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,473
Oh, shit!

320
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,539

321
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,211
l´m so sorry, Viola.

322
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,880
Psst!

323
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:06,015
l mean, you´ve had
an amazing career, Viola.

324
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:12,122
lt´s just that we´re trying to appeal
to a younger demographic.

325
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,995
l´m fine.

326
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,194

331
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,105

Am l kinky or sweet?

335
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:42,156

lf you wanna love me

337
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,464
How good or bad

338
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,762
- Are you okay?
- l´m great.

339
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,826
Hey, l´ve had
a great run.

00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,365
four sitting presidents--

343
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,172
three of them hit on me.

00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,202
Five Emmys!

345
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,941
Now l´m being replaced
by a young thing

346
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,678
whose grandmother
loves me.

347
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,686
You know what

348
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,449
l´m gonna finish out
my contract

349
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,458
and l´m gonna leave this show
with my dignity intact.

350
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,357
Okay, coming back

Four, three, two...

356
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,608
Well, that was
very nice.

357
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:34,874
My goodness, you have a big voice
for such a tiny girl.

358
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,540
You´re gonna miss
Viola Fields.

359
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,140
Have you always
been a singer?

360
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,151
Ever since l was
a child.

361
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,119
l would sing
in school plays, choirs.

362
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,590
- How old are you?
- l´ll be 17 next month.

363
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,156
W-what do you do for fun?

364
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,721
l love watching
really old movies.

365
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,290
- They´re my favorite.
- Really? Really, which ones?

366
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,270
Well, ´´Grease´´

371
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,210
- Oh.
- Yeah-- oh, l know.

372
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,652
You ever read
a newspaper?

373
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,248
Newspaper?

374
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,817
Viola, the girl
has stars on her nipples.

375
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,591
l don´t have
much time for that.

376
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:30,068
So basically, you have absolutely
no idea what´s going on in the world?

377
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,161
- Oh, l--
- And yet, you´ve sold

378
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:35,867
over five million albums-- CDs,
to millions of kids

379
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:39,207
- who listen to your insipid lyrics.
- What is she doing?

380
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,838
´´You want to know me,
look in my makeup bag.´´

381
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,544
You´re influencing
an entire generation of kids

382
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,552
who won´t know how
to think straight,

383
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,554
or vote for a president,

384
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,421
or remember the significance
of Roe versus Wade.

385
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:56,052
Oh! l don´t support
boxing as a sport.

386
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,892
l think
it´s too violent.

387
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,831
Y´all better get that
little girl out of there.

388
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,867
- Holy crap!
- Get us off the air!

389
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:10,068
- Quick!
- Go to commercial! Go to commercial!

390
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,076
Crazy bitch!
Get off me!

391
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,340
- Cut! Cut! Put in the Bow Flex tape!
- Get her off!

392
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,971
Juice Man, something!

393
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,450
Oh, l don´t support
boxing as a sport.

394
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,920
l think
it´s too violent.

395
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,426
Oh.

396
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:35,661
l wanted you to take one last look
at the old Viola.

397
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,829
Oh, thank God
l´ve changed.

398
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,735
Yes.

399
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,603
Well, just remember

400
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,269
the breakdown was
only a few months ago

401
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,108
so take it nice
and slow out there.

402
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,977
No stress.

403
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,040
Absolutely.

404
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,917
ln fact, l´m going
to take a vacation.

405
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,421
l´ve been promising my son
we´d go to Africa

406
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,287
since he was a little boy.

407
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,758
And l finally have
the time.

408
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,420
That´s wonderful.

409
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,293
Not to worry,

410
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,230
l´m in complete control.

411
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,698
Ruby! Ruby,
my dear old friend.

412
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,934
Oh, l´m so happy
to see you.

413
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,134
Well, good,
they still have you medicated.

414
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,473
Ruby, l figured it out.

415
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,105
- Life, l mean.
- Oh, this ought to be good.

416
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:26,083
lt´s not about how many celebrities
l interview or what my ratings are.

417
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:30,077
- lt´s about relationships and family.
- Oh!

418
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,453
Me and my son.

419
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,720
Oh, l just spoke to Kevin.

420
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,217
- Did you get the tickets?
- Sure did. Right here.

421
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,526
He´s going
to be so surprised.

422
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,032
Yeah, the three of you
should have a good time.

423
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:45,002
- Three?
- Yeah, uh, you, Kevin

424
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:48,495
- and his new girlfriend.
- New girlfriend?

425
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,940
That´s a lovely surprise.

426
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,534
ls it?

427
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:55,546
Well, l mean,
it can´t be too serious.

428
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,548
l´ve only been away
a few months.

429
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,163
Well, that´s
the end of it.

430
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,360
Where do you want me
to put this?

431
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,369
Oh, under the bed.

432
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:21,429
Uh, you sure you don´t want me
to put it by the door so you can

433
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:24,636
make a quick escape to the apartment you
still have for some reason?

434
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,042
Now come on. You agreed to me
subletting my apartment.

435
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,105
l would have agreed to anything
to get you to move in here.

436
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,708
Oh, these are great.
Are they new?

437
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,379
Oh, no!
You can´t look at those!

438
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,445
- ´Cause they´re not finished yet.
- Oh, sorry.

439
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,320
- Okay? Please?
- Okay.

440
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,087
Here, l´ll put them back.

441
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:44,425
l forgot to tell you, we´re having lunch
with my mom tomorrow.

442
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,897
Oh!

443
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,196
lt´ll be fine.
l promise.

444
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,132
You want
to take a shower?

445
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,472
Hmm.

446
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,272
Yeah! Okay!

447
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,976
lt´s just a ride,
it´s just a ride

448
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,075
No need to run,
no need to hide

449
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,111
lt´ll take you
round and round.

450
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,952
All right, so tell me
about your dad.

451
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,821
Well, he died
when l was two.

452
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,656
But that was just
her first husband.

453
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,060
At the time she was
a freelance journalist

454
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:21,429
and then she married this guy
who was a network exec

455
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,434
and got her her first
on-air break,

456
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,493
but divorced him
for Alec Wrigley.

457
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,368
Wait, the actor?
l thought he was--

458
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,374
Oh, he was.
lt lasted about two years

459
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,775
till she threw him out for sleeping
with her second husband.

460
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,779
Wait, how many times
has she been married?

461
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,440
- Well, four.
- Wow.

462
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,109
But, you know, her career
was always the main thing.

463
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:42,314
She just lived for it.
Well, her career and me, of course.

464
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,618
And, basically,
now l´m all she´s got.

465
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,295
Here we are.

466
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,854
Oh, no.

467
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:03,440
Oh, playing dress-up,
are we?

468
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:11,344
- Shut up. ls that the Dalai Lama?
- Yeah.

469
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,977
- Oh my God, That can´t be real.
- lt is.

470
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:18,478
Did you know
all these people?

471
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,491
- Some of them.
- Kevin!

472
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:23,494
- Look at you, all handsome.
- Ruby!

473
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,462
Good to see you.

474
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,226
Yeah, you too.

475
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,823
Now, forget about
my mother.

476
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:32,030
This is the woman you need
to get through. Charlie, this is Ruby.

477
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,164
- Well, it´s a pleasure to meet you.
- Oh, the pleasure´s mine.

478
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:38,904
Uh, excuse us.
l´ve got to talk to him about a rash.

479
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:46,006
You´re bringing a girl home
to meet your mother now?

480
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,814
Yeah, Ruby, l am.

481
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,219
The women is fresh off
the funny farm.

482
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,691
l mean, why don´t you
come back, let´s say... next spring?

483
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,750
Oh, the trees
will be blooming.

484
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,422
- lt´ll be so beautiful. She´ll love it.
- How is she?

485
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:01,227
She´s good.
The first thing she did

486
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,757
when she got home was make me
lock up all the booze.

487
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,770
lt´s Oprah!

488
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,204
Oprah!

489
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,935
Yeah, Oprah.

490
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:13,035
There´s one in there
with the cast from ´´Good Times´´ too.

491
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:15,635
So how big is this place?

492
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,148
About four acres.
There´s a tennis court,

493
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,209
two swimming pools,
indoor and outdoor-- it´s kind of crazy.

494
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,813
What?
No helicopter pad?

495
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,220
Oh, no.
There´s one out back.

496
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,884
l´m kidding.

497
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,392
Kevin!

498
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:31,327
Oh, l´ve missed you
so much!

499
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,297
l promise l´ll never
leave you again.

500
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,133
Oh my God, Mom.
Look at you. You look fantastic.

501
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:40,934
- lt´s just something l threw together.
- Come here.

502
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,532
- What?
- l want to introduce you to someone.

503
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,372
- Charlie. Mom.
- Kevin.

504
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,072
Charlie, this is Mom.

505
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,740
Mom, Charlie.

506
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,908
Oh, hi.

507
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:56,253
Oh, l´d love to just be able
to think of it and make it.

508
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,722
l must have spent
the last 30 years

509
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:00,657
looking for the perfect
little black--

510
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,660
- Cocktail dress.
- ...cocktail dress. Yes.

511
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,355
l know.

512
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,593
Well, it doesn´t matter. You could
wear anything with your figure.

513
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,964
- l mean, you look amazing.
- Oh, honey, thanks.

514
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:13,664
Listen, when you´re my age,
if ain´t broke, you fix it before it is.

515
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,588
Why the question mark?

516
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,253
Oh, ´cause
l just don´t know.

517
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,855
l love your jewelry.

518
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,866
- Oh, yes. Yes, thank you.
- l love that.

519
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,494
- l like it-- the earth tones.
- lt´s fantastic.

520
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,731
- Where did you get this from?
- My first husband.

521
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,501
That´s Kevin´s father. He gave it to me
when we were in Peru.

522
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,509
- lt´s very earthy.
- lt´s like the dress,

523
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,908
very earthy.

524
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:03,014
l just think it´s wonderful
that you´ve tried so many temp jobs.

525
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,045
Think of all
the experiences you have.

526
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,556
You´ve been
so quiet, Kevin.

527
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:12,620
Oh, well, it´s kind of hard to get
a word in edgewise with you two.

528
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:15,326
Oh, is he great,
or what?

529
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,335
l tell you too,
that´s a little scary.

530
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,462
Enjoy it while you can.

531
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,165
Here you go,
some more coffee.

532
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,834
Actually, l was a little nervous
about the two of you meeting.

533
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,342
- Really?
- Why?

534
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,174
Well, ´cause it´s
important to me.

535
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,703
Mom, you´re the most
amazing woman l´ve ever known.

536
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,749
And, Charlie,
l´ve never met anyone like you.

537
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,083
You´re real,
you´re honest.

538
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,715
And although we´ve only
known each other a few months,

539
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:41,055
l-l feel like
l´ve known you forever.

540
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:45,085
l guess what l´m
trying to say here...

541
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,999
is what are you doing
for the rest of your life?

542
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,231
What?

543
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,608
Oh my God!

544
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,114
Charlie, will you
marry me?

545
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:08,882
lt´s...
it´s too sudden.

546
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,285
- She´s in shock.
- No!

547
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,881
- l mean, l am, but...
- Yes!

548
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,258
Seriously?

549
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,228
Seriously.

550
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,026
No no. Say ´´no.´´

551
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,397
Yes. Yes!

552
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,732
Yeah!

553
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:26,327
Oh, gee-- oh!

554
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,104
Oh, l´m so happy for you.

555
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:37,114
- Congratulations!
- Oh my God. l can´t believe this.

556
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:38,638
l am so happy for you.

557
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:41,447
Congratulations!
l´m so pleased

558
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,683
that you´re going to be
my daughter-in-law.

559
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,192
Oh, congratulations.

560
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,717
- l can´t believe this.
- l´m so happy for you.

561
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:54,129
- Thank you!
- You´re going to need a moment alone.

562
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,565
- Excuse me, l´ll be right back.
- Okay.

563
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:57,898
Oh!

564
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:58,994
Shit!

565
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,968
Medicine.

566
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,979
Let´s see.

567
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,640
No.

568
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,843
What´s-- ah!

569
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,511
14% alcohol!

570
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,117
- You are so crazy! Oh my God!
- l almost forgot.

571
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,619
l´ve been carrying this around for two
weeks waiting for the perfect moment.

572
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:28,655
l can´t believe this
turned out to be it.

573
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,394
- Kevin.
- Try it on.

574
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,603
lt is the perfect moment.

575
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,776
Maybe you should go
check on your mom.

576
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,754
Oh, she´s fine. She´s probably
calling all of our relatives.

577
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,724
Oh, Holy Spirit...

578
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:56,056
surround me with light.

579
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,355
Please rid me
of my negative karma

580
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,263
and my wickedness.

581
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,463
Please help me be
a better person.

582
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:11,507
l could just kill
that dog-walking slut!

583
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,081
Of course.

584
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:20,175
She´s pregnant.

585
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:25,485
So, goodness.
That was a lot to take in at teatime.

586
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:28,083
- Oh, you´re telling me.
- l had no idea

587
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,026
that you guys
were so serious.

588
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:32,086
Kevin, you never
mentioned anything.

589
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,621
- Mom.
- Here´s what l want to say.

590
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,691
lt´s wonderful
being in love.

591
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:41,330
But l don´t think marriage is
the best solution to a thing like this.

592
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:46,510
Well, you know nowadays
a girl has so many alternatives

593
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,978
to getting married--
there´s adoption, abortion,

594
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,311
- lesbianism-- Hmm?
- Whoa, Mom!

595
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,375
- What are you talking about?
- Well, l mean, it´s so sudden

596
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,649
l have to assume
there´s a pressing reason.

597
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,747
Oh oh, no.

598
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,348
Charlie´s not pregnant.

599
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,219
Call me old-fashioned,

600
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,697
marriage is a sacred union

601
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:11,190
that should only be entered into
with the utmost care.

602
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,227
Weren´t you married
four times?

603
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,669
Yes, dear.

604
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,339
Which would make me an expert,
don´t you think?

605
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,346
Excuse me.

606
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,075
lt´s the hospital.
l´ll be right back.

607
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:28,881
Okay.

608
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,888
You want me to go
with you?

609
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,913
No, stay right there.

610
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:47,767
You know, this is as sudden
for me as it is for you.

611
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,773
lt´s too sudden, right?

612
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,604
You think?

613
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,110
Yeah.

614
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,736
Really?

615
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,111
l mean, what´s the rush?
lt´s not like the old days

616
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,055
where you had to get married
and have kids,

617
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,251
and have it all figured out
by the time you were 21.

618
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,318
- Exactly.
- We have options now.

619
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,454
And l´ve always liked
having my options, you know?

620
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:13,862
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

621
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:17,265
This is so... big.

622
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,664
What am l--
what am l doing?

623
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,345
l love Kevin.

624
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,648
l want to spend the rest
of my life with him.

625
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,517
Oh my God!
l´m getting married!

626
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,148
Ruby!

627
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:44,059
Ruby, l need a bottle of champagne.
We´re going to celebrate.

628
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:46,723
May l have the key
to the liquor cabinet please?

629
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,026
What key?

630
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,702
The key, Ruby.

631
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,261
Key?
There´s no key.

632
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,274
Ruby, give me the key.

633
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,742
You want to take this
outside?

634
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,376
Bring me the key.

635
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,118
And fix your hair.

636
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,090
You look like
a damned cockatoo.

637
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:21,228
She is such
a fabulous assistant.

638
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,472
Hey, do you think
your mother liked me?

639
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,738
Of course. Why?

640
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:36,178
l don´t know, because she called me
a pregnant lesbian?

641
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,216
l´m sure she meant that
as a compliment.

642
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,685
Trust me.
She loved you.

643
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,245
Oh, they´re gone?

644
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,951
l´ll just put this baby
back to bed, okay?

645
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:51,758
My son
the brilliant surgeon

646
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:56,495
is gonna marry a temp.

647
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:08,542
Gonna need something
stronger than this.

648
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:10,979
Where´s that martini?

649
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:13,711
Hooch will not solve
your problems.

650
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:16,982
She´s going to destroy him.

651
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:19,046
lt is so clear.

652
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,684
She´s got no money,
no career goals.

653
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,627
She was just waiting
for a rich innocent

654
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,254
to step right
in her path.

655
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,731
Oh, Kevin´s
smarter than that.

656
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,700
Come on,
you raised him well.

657
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,362
He´s a good boy.

658
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,496
But he´s a man.
That´s the problem.

659
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:37,599
The only time they think straight
is when they have an erection,

660
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,770
and it´s usually pointed
right at the trampiest woman.

661
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:44,111
You talking about
her or you?

662
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:47,276
Look, there´s nothing
you can do.

663
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,751
Just let it go.

664
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,254
You know what you need?
A project.

665
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:52,916
Or another husband.

666
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:55,289
You know, why don´t you
marry another gay guy?

667
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:56,953
That was fun.

668
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:59,053
You know, you´re right.

669
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,997
l do need a project.

670
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,796
And l have
the perfect one.

671
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,962
l am going
to save my son.

672
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,130
Here.

673
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,367
- What?
- You go use those old contacts of yours

674
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:13,206
to get all the information you can
about that little pimp.

675
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,735
And exactly what do you
expect to find?

676
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,943
Everybody´s got
a past, honey.

677
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,110
Find something.

678
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,416
And l´m going to open up
the Montecito house

679
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,149
and get a party planner.

680
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:28,181
l´m going to give them
an engagement party.

681
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,490
And then what?
Lock her in the basement?

682
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,758
When he sees how out of place
she is in his world,

683
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,197
it´s gonna be over.

684
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,861
This will end badly.

685
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,767
Get me another one
of those.

686
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,739
Ooh-ohh

687
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:45,537
l just want to
get down with you

688
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,203
Eh!

689
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:50,214
l just want
to get close to you

690
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,375
Ooh-ohh

691
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,316
l just need to go
farther...

692
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:57,446
ls it me, or is each house
you take me to bigger than the last?

693
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,396
But l thought your mom
said this was a barbecue.

694
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:10,832
Oh my God. lt looks like she´s invited
everyone l´ve ever known.

695
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,195
And they´re all
in black tie.

696
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,207
Oh, there´s my mom.
Mom!

697
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:20,574
Darlings!
How was the trip?

698
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,772
- Welcome.
- l´m sorry.

699
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:25,008
- l didn´t know this was a formal party.
- Well, that´s because

700
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,244
l have something for you.
l bought you a new dress.

701
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,116
Oh, see?
There´s a dress upstairs.

702
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,417
- Thank you.
- Besides, you look great in anything.

703
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:34,390
Exactly. You always look
so clean and shiny.

704
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:38,054
Oh, Kevin, your tuxedo
is upstairs in your room.

705
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,689
But first l want you to meet
some friends. Come.

706
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,562
- Prince Amir.
- Can l change first?

707
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:48,464
- This is Sarah. Kevin.
- You know Kevin.

708
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:51,134
And this is Charlie.
She´s a temp.

709
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:56,071
Charlie, this is the man that introduced the
euro to the global market.

710
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:57,876
- Mr. Prime Minister.
- Viola.

711
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:00,611
Oh, Marie. You know my son,
but this is Charlie.

712
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:03,586
- Very good to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

713
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,885
- She´s a temp.
- Yeah.

714
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:08,448
l worked in a bank once.

715
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,687
Oh, look! There´s
the Poet Laureate and--

716
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:14,129
oh, Charlie, first l want you to meet
the Secretary of Commerce.

717
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,826
Viola, please let me
change first.

718
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,993
l don´t want to meet her
in my flip-flops.

719
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:21,436
Of course, of course. Ruby, would
you show Charlie to the guest room?

720
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,838
- Come on, Charlie.
- Thank you. Thank you.

721
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,449
Wow!

722
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:34,212
Oh my--

723
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,379
it´s vintage.

724
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:40,016
Oh, Fiona.

725
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:43,083
- You look stunning.
- Thank you. So do you.

726
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,152
My goodness.

727
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,426
Kevin just went up
to his old room.

728
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:50,093
- Why don´t you go say hello to him?
- l´d love to.

729
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:52,034
Good girl.

730
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,744
Fiona, what are you doing here?
l´m dressing.

731
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,311
Why don´t you let me give you
a hand with that?

732
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,846
Give it up, Fiona.

733
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:19,323
You know, you and l had
a very strong bond once.

734
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:22,662
No, you and l had
very strong drinks once.

735
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,258
That´s not true.

736
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,430
Kiss me. l´ll remind you
how good it was.

737
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,836
What are you doing?

738
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,636
l´m engaged.
l´m happy.

739
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,973
lt´s gonna fit!

740
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,841
Why did she get me
such a small dress?

741
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,312
l have two asses.

742
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:45,515
lt´ll fit.
There we go.

743
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,183
Okay.

744
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:49,715
Okay! Okay!

745
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,664
What is it about her
that´s so special?

746
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,692
l don´t know but l plan on spending
the rest of my life finding out.

747
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,666
Kevin!

748
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:08,008
God! Men in love
are really hot.

749
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,639
Fiona!

750
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,649
Oops! Um...

751
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,278
l was just giving Kevin
a congratulatory kiss.

752
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,016
Don´t, uh, worry.

753
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:21,490
Why would l worry?
He´s gay, right?

754
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,930
Charlie!

755
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,436
Charlie, that was not
what it looked like.

756
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,136
l´m going home.

757
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:42,202
l´ve destroyed
priceless couture.

758
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:47,240
l embarrassed myself
in front of 70% of the world´s royalty.

759
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:49,252
Oh! l forgot, yeah!

760
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:53,484
l just caught you making out
with your ex-girlfriend.

761
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,492
Charlie, let me explain.

762
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,790
Ugh!
lt doesn´t matter.

763
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,661
l can´t do this.

764
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:08,731
l don´t belong here,
Kevin.

765
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:13,037
And if l don´t belong here
then maybe we don´t--

766
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,704
Hey hey hey.
Listen to me.

767
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,736
lt´s you and me now.

768
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,739
This isn´t my world anymore.

769
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,775
You´re my world.

770
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,694
Okay?

771
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:33,288
Now let´s get the hell out of here.
l´m taking you home.

772
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,525
Okay.

773
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:36,965
Um...

774
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:40,903
Let me try and get out
of this dress and then...

775
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,133
Okay, see you
downstairs.

776
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:06,628
There´s a million miles
to go

777
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:11,829
Till our happiness lives

778
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:17,205
There´s a million miles
to go

779
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:21,769
Till our happiness lives.

780
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,574
Do you like it?

781
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,310
Yeah, it´s great.

782
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,648
l´m so glad you
finally decided to do it.

783
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:32,952
l don´t know. l just woke up today
and it just felt like home.

784
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,356
l´m gonna do
all three walls.

785
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:38,088
You know, l think it´s time
to take a break.

786
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:39,493
Oh, wait!

787
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,828
- Wait a minute.
- Whoo whoo whoo!

788
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,595
l can´t let it dry
too much.

789
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:46,364
Oh God!

790
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:50,841
Are we getting out of bed
today, ´´Camille´´?

791
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,173
What for?

792
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,508
l could die
and nobody would care.

793
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,070
l would.

794
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:59,810
You promised me
a face-lift.

795
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,308
Sit down, Ruby.
Sit with me, hold my hand.

796
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:08,487
Have you got anything
on the girl yet?

797
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,494
Nothing. Nada.

798
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,462
No criminal record.
No debt.

799
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:15,829
Good grades. Went to design school.
And then a string of odd jobs.

800
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,562
lsn´t that exactly what
somebody with a past does?

801
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:21,036
What about drugs?
What about promiscuity?

802
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,039
She´s had fewer lovers
in her entire life

803
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,701
than you did
at closing day of Woodstock.

804
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:28,644
Well, find something.

805
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:32,376
Well, l guess if l had
a hair sample maybe l could take it

806
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,544
- to my little crime lab and--
- Perfect.

807
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,486
l´ll get to work on it.

808
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:40,183
Listen to me.
There is nothing.

809
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,318
Has it ever occurred to you
that maybe she´s a good girl?

810
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,351
Oh, don´t joke.

811
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:50,255
l would like to speak to that woman
who got back from the loony bin.

812
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,064
ls she around?

813
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:54,866
Because you are taking me
for a spin in the crazy mobile.

814
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:58,768
Ruby, Ruby.

815
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,403
Everybody knows that when
a woman marries a man

816
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,413
she marries his mother
too, right?

817
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,348
What if l drive her crazy?

818
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,874
Okay, now you´re
foaming at the mouth.

819
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,084
Oh!

820
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,993
Charlie and Kevin´s house.

821
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:20,792
Oh, l forgot you live there.

822
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:25,700
l didn´t realize that you
had already moved in.

823
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:29,638
Kevin, stop it. l´m on the phone
with your mother! l´m sorry, Viola.

824
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:32,039
The slut´s practically
fornicating with him!

825
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:33,566
- Stop it!
- l don´t blame her.

826
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,169
That boy´s a fine piece of ass.

827
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:38,773
Hold on, Viola.
He´s-- stop it! Right here.

828
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:40,807
Actually, Charlie,
the reason l´m calling

829
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:43,581
is l wondered if you´d
like to have lunch next week.

830
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:47,250
- Really?
- How would Tuesday work for you?

831
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,953
Yeah,
Tuesday´s perfect!

832
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,963
Listen, Viola, l´m kind of in the middle
of something right now,

833
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,056
um, but Tuesday´s fine.

834
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,930
Yeah, me too.

835
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,959
- Lots to do!
- Okay, bye!

836
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:03,029
Oh.

837
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:08,070
l´ll go get the vodka.

838
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:22,685
lt´s good to see you.

839
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:24,717
There she is.

840
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,562
Charlotte.

841
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:34,935
Hi. l´m going to have
the garden salad

842
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:38,965
and the low-cal Chinese dressing
and a decaf iced tea.

843
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,739
- And you, miss?
- Oh, um, l´ll just have a...

844
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:45,180
cheeseburger
with fries and a soda.

845
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:46,842
- All right.
- Okay.

846
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:49,717
You continue
to surprise me.

847
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:52,847
Aren´t you worried about fitting
in your wedding dress?

848
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,859
Well, l mean, l´m making the dress
to fit my body,

849
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:57,520
not the other way
around.

850
00:44:57,561 --> 00:45:00,496
Whoa. l wish l had been
that confident when l got married.

851
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,261
l´ll tell you one thing
you´re gonna have that l never did,

852
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,359
a stupendous wedding.

853
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:09,236
And it´s important that we
book the church right away.

854
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:12,401
l always thought
that Kevin looked like Jesus

855
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:15,105
in the cathedral down
on Second Street. Mmm.

856
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:19,639
Actually, we were thinking
of having...

857
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:21,947
a non-denominational
service,

858
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:24,681
being that l´m more spiritual
than religious.

859
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,053
Oh.

860
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:29,889
What about my place then?

861
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:32,361
That way we don´t even
need to book a location.

862
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,694
And Kevin was born there
and grew up there.

863
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,496
Oh, it would mean
so much to him. l´ll plan it all.

864
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:41,163
We´ll have that marvelous band
that the Swansons´ had at their wedding.

865
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,230
And a divine cake.
Oh, honey!

866
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:45,400
No no no!
Tsk tsk tsk!

867
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,410
Chewing,
it´s a disgusting habit.

868
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:50,545
Oh, hold still.
l´ve gotta-- gotta--

869
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,242
- There! Got it!
- Ow!

870
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:55,581
Thanks, um...

871
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,712
What do you think
about peach?

872
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:01,955
- Oh, um, excuse me.
- Yes?

873
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:04,017
Can l get another salad
without the nuts?

874
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:06,120
- l have allergies.
- Okay.

875
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:09,030
l´m allergic to nuts,
and eggs, and shellfish,

876
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:11,626
and blueberries.
Oh-- and soy.

877
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:14,865
lt´s amazing you´ve been able
to nourish yourself all these years.

878
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:18,141
Oh, yeah!
The cake!

879
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:22,236
l´m thinking traditional vanilla
with strawberry drizzle.

880
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:26,648
Look, Viola, l really do
have all of this under control.

881
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,310
l made this for you.

882
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:31,150
lt´s your wedding planner book.
Peach.

883
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,221
Oh.

884
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:37,227
ls that a picture
of me and Kevin?

885
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:40,958
Oh, and-- present time
from your new mama!

886
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:42,829
Thanks.

887
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:52,137
Wow!

888
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:55,145
lt´s big! You can see
the thorns on the roses.

889
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,807
You´ll wear it on your wedding day,
just like l did.

890
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:00,510
Of course l was
a virgin when l wed.

891
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:03,349
But we´ll just pretend
with you.

892
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,355
Now, about the wedding--

893
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:08,085
the two of you are going to arrive
in a horse and carriage.

894
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:11,492
And the driver´s top-hat
will match the horse´s saddles,

895
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:13,223
and the ribbons
on the doves

896
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:16,323
that will be released
at the exact moment

897
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:19,301
of ´´l do,´´ hmm?

898
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:23,297
And l´ve been in touch
with your bridesmaids.

899
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,035
How do you know
their names?

900
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:27,908
Well, Kevin told me.
And l think for the honeymoon

901
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:30,743
St. Bart´s is the absolute
best place for you to go

902
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:33,011
- ´cause Kevin adores it.
- Hey, just hold on!

903
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,711
Just wait
a minute, okay?

904
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,021
No.

905
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:41,286
Thank you, but no.

906
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:44,192
Thank you,
but no to everything.

907
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:47,459
No to the horse
and buggy.

908
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:50,432
No to the top-hats,
and to the doves and geese

909
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,368
and any other farm animals
you´re thinking of using that day.

910
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:55,963
And definitely no to you
planning our honeymoon.

911
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:57,371
- What?
- Oh no.

912
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:58,772
l can-- oh!

913
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:01,642
- Oh oh!
- What´s wrong?

914
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:03,669
- ´´Oh no´´ what?
- My pills, my pills!

915
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,011
Okay.
Well, let me help you.

916
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,642
- Oh!
- Viola!

917
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,675
- Oh, no!
- Wait, Viola!

918
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,415
Viola!

919
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:13,423
Viola!

920
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:16,255
Oh my God, Viola.
Oh my God!

921
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:18,261
- Give her some room.
- Help!

922
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:21,025
- Give her some air.
- My God, is she dead?

923
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,123
- No!
- Get her some help.

924
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,157
lt couldn´t be
that easy.

925
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,975
She´s had
an anxiety attack,

926
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:34,204
which can feel like
a heart attack.

927
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,871
She´s gonna be okay.

928
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,610
But she definitely needs
to take it easy. No stress.

929
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,710
She said that you were
yelling at her,

930
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:46,484
that you refused her gift
and said she couldn´t plan our wedding.

931
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:49,219
Tell me that´s
not true.

932
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:52,194
Well, technically...

933
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:53,491
yes.

934
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,294
But, hold on.
l didn´t yell at her.

935
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,699
And she just kept pushing
and pushing and pushing.

936
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:01,602
And, okay, l admit it.
l snapped a little bit. But--

937
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:04,539
What was l supposed to do?
She wouldn´t take no for an answer.

938
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:07,304
Come on, look, you know
what a hard time she´s been having.

939
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,403
- So she´s a little difficult.
- Difficult?

940
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,879
A two-year-old
is difficult.

941
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,144
- She´s like-- ah!
- Come on, she´s all alone.

942
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,151
l´m all she´s got--
we´re all she´s got.

943
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:17,483
Come on.

944
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:18,988
Excuse me.

945
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:21,582
l´m Dr. Chamberlain,
the psychiatrist in residence.

946
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,149
- Are you Mrs. Fields´s son?
- Yes.

947
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:25,855
- May we speak in private?
- Actually, this is my fiancee.

948
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:27,693
We can talk.
Um, is she okay?

949
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:30,894
Well, l just completed your mother´s
interview and l´m concerned.

950
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:34,802
lt´s possible that she´s on the verge
of a psychotic break.

951
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:38,774
l should probably see her
at least twice a week, minimum.

952
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,607
Also, l prescribed her
some anti-anxiety medication.

953
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,307
lf she starts to feel
overwhelmed, they´ll relax her.

954
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:45,940
Does she live alone?

955
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,348
Uh, yeah.

956
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:49,511
Well, l feel
it would be best

957
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:51,453
if she were cared for
by relatives--

958
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,888
people that are closest
to her during this time.

959
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:56,415
Just until we´re confident
that she´s out of danger.

960
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,894
All right.
Well, thank you, Doctor.

961
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:02,493
Oh, God.

962
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:04,432
l´ve got that
medical conference.

963
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,935
What am l gonna do?

964
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:09,063
You know what?
Don´t-- don´t worry about it.

965
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,768
Um, l´ll take care of her.

966
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,141
Thank you.

967
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,010
- Come on.
- What?

968
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,312
- No, come with me.
- No no, the doctor said no stress.

969
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,581
- Charlie, come on. Enough already.
- l´ll stay here. Kevin!

970
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,014
Come on.

971
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,293
l am so sorry.

972
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,731
No, Mom, don´t be.
lt´s okay, really.

973
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:37,756
Charlie?

974
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:42,371
l´m sorry too, Viola.

975
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:44,670
No, l was too pushy.

976
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:47,636
No.

977
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:50,237
You weren´t.
Look, Viola...

978
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:54,216
l would love it if you would
help me with the wedding.

979
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:57,084
lt´s all right,
sweetheart, l--

980
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,350
l don´t really think
l´m up to it.

981
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,254
My nerves are shot.

982
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,189
Mom--

983
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:11,057
Mom, Charlie and l think
you should live with us for a while,

984
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,035
until you feel better.

985
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,901
Are you sure?

986
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,138
Oh!

987
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:21,842
Oh, l can´t possibly.

988
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:23,675
- l couldn´t.
- Mom, it´s okay. Relax.

989
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:27,647
l couldn´t possibly.

990
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:31,877
Not unless l know
Charlotte´s forgiven me.

991
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:35,153
Will you?

992
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,791
Me?

993
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:39,819
Yeah, l forgive you.

994
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:48,102
You just put those
anywhere.

995
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:53,433
- Hi!
- Hi.

996
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,945
- Are you feeling better?
- l´m much better, thank you.

997
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:58,140
- Great.
- Sweetheart, l´m kind of thirsty.

998
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:00,479
- Would you-- is the kitchen over there?
- Yeah, sure.

999
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:02,849
- Great. Goodbye.
- Okay.

1000
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:06,815
- Hey, Charlie.
- Are you moving in, too?

1001
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:08,825
No, l don´t like
the neighborhood.

1002
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:11,293
Look, do you have any
firearms in the house?

1003
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:14,456
- No.
- You might want to get one.

1004
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,965
When will you be back?

1005
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:26,237
Soon as l can, honey.
l promise.

1006
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:28,506
Are you sure
you´re gonna be okay?

1007
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:31,708
Yeah. l mean, hey,
it´s only at night, right?

1008
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:34,216
And, l mean, she´s gonna
sleep most of the time

1009
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:37,186
with those pills
the doctor gave her. Right?

1010
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,950
Look, l know my mom can be
a little challenging.

1011
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,322
So if you have any
problems just call me.

1012
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,418
l´m on the first flight back,
l promise.

1013
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:46,759
Okay.
Well, hurry home.

1014
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:48,764
And who knows?
By the time l get back,

1015
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:51,323
maybe you two
will be best friends.

1016
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:53,359
Oh, am l interrupting
something?

1017
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:55,530
- Uh, no, Mom, come in.
- The caterer called.

1018
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:57,540
He still thinks
l´m doing the wedding.

1019
00:52:57,574 --> 00:53:00,668
He sent over a sample plate
´cause l gave him the colors you wanted.

1020
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,871
l said absolutely no peach.

1021
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:07,475
And from now on, everything
goes through my new daughter.

1022
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,382
- Thank you.
- Yeah?

1023
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,011
Okay, l´ll be
right down, thanks.

1024
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:15,013
- Oh, here. Look.
- Oh, it´s beautiful, Viola.

1025
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:17,458
- Thank you.
- Oh, l´m glad you like it.

1026
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:19,485
- Thanks.
- My car´s here. Gotta go.

1027
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,996
- Bye, Mom. Bye, Mom.
- Okay.

1028
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,829
Oh, bye, sweetie.
Oh, it´s gonna be fun.

1029
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,097
- We´re gonna have such a good time.
- l love you.

1030
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,161
- l´ll be a good roommate. l promise.
- Okay.

1031
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,696
Ohh!

1032
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:34,039
lt´s so nice
to have a girlfriend.

1033
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:35,738
Yeah, huh?

1034
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,068
Viola?

1035
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:07,543
- Are you all right?
- l can´t sleep.

1036
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,441
l feel so alone.

1037
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:14,450
l do.

1038
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:16,452
You´re not alone.
l´m here.

1039
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:21,023
Did you take
your pills?

1040
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:24,618
My pills?
Oh no, l forgot.

1041
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:27,129
Could you get them
for me, sweetie?

1042
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:29,188
They´re on the sink.

1043
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:31,223
Sure.

1044
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,299
Here they are.

1045
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:44,246
- Thank you.
- You´re welcome.

1046
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,216
Oh, l don´t have any water.
Could you get me some water please?

1047
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,741
Okay.

1048
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,254
Oh, l can´t drink out
of the tap.

1049
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:56,517
Would you get me some Evian...
with ice?

1050
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:59,060
Yeah.

1051
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:08,834
Here you go.

1052
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:10,533
Oh, thank you.

1053
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,872
You have a good night,
okay?

1054
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,140
Charlotte?

1055
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:20,081
l hate to ask you this,

1056
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:22,482
but it´s my
first night here.

1057
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:25,113
Could you stay with me?

1058
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,055
Please?

1059
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,524
Sleep with me.
Be a good girl.

1060
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:34,497
Huh? No no no!

1061
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:37,091
No no, don´t!

1062
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:40,961
God! Viola!

1063
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,131
- Are you okay?
- No, let go of me, you!

1064
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,834
No.

1065
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,559
Huh? Oh!

1066
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:05,527
Okay. Okay.

1067
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:30,552
Hi, how was your day?

1068
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:32,316
lt was... okay.

1069
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:34,152
Wonderful!

1070
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:35,657
You´re cooking.

1071
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:38,752
l wanted to make you
dinner all by myself.

1072
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:40,456
- Sit.
- Okay.

1073
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:45,901
lt´s steak
and kidney pie.

1074
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:49,200
Actually, the steak didn´t defrost
in time so it´s mostly kidney.

1075
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,264
Mmm!

1076
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:53,298
- Do you like it?
- Mm-hm!

1077
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,671
l made a decision today.

1078
00:56:57,714 --> 00:57:00,649
l called my lawyer
and l asked him to redo my will.

1079
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:03,550
l want to include
my new daughter.

1080
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,350
Really, Viola,
that´s not necessary.

1081
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,257
Oh, don´t be silly.
l want to.

1082
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:14,559
Of course they have all these
stupid questions that they want to ask.

1083
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,464
You know, like, ´´Are you
currently an illegal alien?´´

1084
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,230
Oh, uh, no.

1085
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:23,634
Oh, that´s interesting.
Okay.

1086
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:26,870
Um, are there any hereditary illnesses
in your family?

1087
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,879
You know, the kind that could be
passed on to grandchildren?

1088
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:31,778
- Uh, no.
- No.

1089
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:34,807
How many men have you been
sexually active with?

1090
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:37,046
What? Why would they
want to know that?

1091
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:39,884
That many, huh?

1092
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:42,619
Would you be willing to sign
a prenuptial agreement?

1093
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:47,085
- Excuse me?
- l know.

1094
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,031
They´re such nosy bastards.
lt´s none of their business.

1095
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:51,590
Let´s just deal
with this later.

1096
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:54,068
No, why don´t we deal
with it right now?

1097
00:57:57,073 --> 00:57:59,268
l´ll tell you what,
l´ll clean up the kitchen

1098
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,640
and you continue
enjoying your dinner.

1099
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:03,305
No no no.

1100
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:05,814
You did all the cooking.
l´ll clean up.

1101
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,680
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1102
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:10,117
l am kind of tired.
Thanks.

1103
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,053
Well, l´ll just
go up to bed then.

1104
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:14,648
l had kind of a difficult
night last night.

1105
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:16,682
You had a difficult night?

1106
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:22,797
He´s skidding
out of control.

1107
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,993
This bus is out of control.

1108
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,608
ls somebody there?

1109
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,906
Tina.

1110
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:38,681
Tina.

1111
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:40,376
Who the hell is that?

1112
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:01,302
Oh.

1113
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:03,305
What?
Oh my God.

1114
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:06,308
- l thought you were sleeping.
- Well, l couldn´t sleep.

1115
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:08,310
Hmm? What do you think
of my outfit?

1116
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:11,245
This is a ceremonial robe
given to me by Chairman Mao.

1117
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:12,908
These go with the robe.

1118
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,918
This was a birthday gift
from the Dalai Lama.

1119
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:18,147
He never forgot
my birthday.

1120
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:20,621
Of course now
he doesn´t care anymore.

1121
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:22,625
- Do you mind if l sit with you?
- No.

1122
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:24,627
- Just for a little while.
- Okay.

1123
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:29,030
Why is she running?

1124
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,693
Well, someone´s
chasing her.

1125
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,032
Why is he chasing her?

1126
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,231
l´m not sure.

1127
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:37,899
Well, who is he?

1128
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:40,102
l don´t know.
We have to watch.

1129
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:42,441
- You have to stop talking.
- Mm.

1130
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:44,446
Don´t you hate
what she´s wearing?

1131
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,278
Running out there
with bare feet and, what is that,

1132
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:49,615
a pajama top?
lt´s so unrealistic.

1133
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:52,587
l once did a whole segment
on nighttime television.

1134
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:55,113
You would not believe

1135
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:57,558
how much the demographics
influence the networks.

1136
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,791
l mean it´s just ridiculous.
All they care about is the bottom line.

1137
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,923
Oh, it´s so nice just to sit
with family and do nothing, huh?

1138
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:05,799
Don´t even need to talk.
lt´s wonderful.

1139
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:08,030
l miss so much
being a working mom.

1140
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,971
l used to bring Kevin,
though, to the set.

1141
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:11,940
That´s where he met
Gore Vidal and Jackie Chan.

1142
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:13,567
ls there anybody famous
in this movie?

1143
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,134
Because l don´t know
any of them.

1144
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:16,873
And they all look
the same-- all the girls

1145
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:19,279
have the same body,
all the boys have the same hair.

1146
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:21,943
...so many beautiful people
who live in Los Angeles?

1147
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:24,886
l think all the beautiful genes
ended up in California.

1148
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:28,152
Why is he kissing her?
lt´s beyond me.

1149
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:49,738
l´m sorry. l thought
it was air freshener.

1150
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:01,850
- Charlie?
- Dr. Batel´s office.

1151
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:05,020
Miss Reynolds?

1152
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:07,029
Hi.

1153
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:08,860
Yeah.

1154
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:11,230
Nope. Okay.

1155
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:13,462
Bye.

1156
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:19,234
Oh God. l-l´m sorry.

1157
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:21,607
You know what?
That´s probably my fault.

1158
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:24,340
l mean,
l never thought she´d--

1159
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,405
l mean, she´s a little
eccentric, you know?

1160
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:29,145
- l´m sorry.
- Well, lt doesn´t matter.

1161
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:32,552
l don´t want to talk about your mom
tonight. l want to talk about us.

1162
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:35,887
- l miss you.
- l miss you too.

1163
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:39,691
Especially now
when l´m in the tub...

1164
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:42,857
naked and wet...

1165
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:44,867
and naked.

1166
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:47,699
Really?

1167
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:49,864
Well, do you know what l would do
to you if l was there?

1168
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:51,567
- What?
- Well, for starters--

1169
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:53,370
Charlie!

1170
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:55,343
- l´m not looking. l´m not looking.
- Hello?

1171
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,539
- l just wanted to return your shampoo.
- Your mom just walked in.

1172
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,378
You really should use a shampoo
that doesn´t dry your hair so much.

1173
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:02,907
We don´t want a bride
with straw under her veil.

1174
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:04,920
- Oh, is that Kevin?
- Yeah, it is.

1175
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:07,422
- Honey, your mom wants to talk to you.
- Sweetie, hi.

1176
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:10,915
- Hi, Mom.
- Honey, l can´t thank you both enough.

1177
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,896
- Of course.
- l´m having the most wonderful time.

1178
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:17,365
- How´s Charlie?
- Oh, she´s been a doll.

1179
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,561
We´ve been girlfriends
all week.

1180
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:22,537
- Great.
- l´m gonna be sad to go home.

1181
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:26,531
You do? Well, you never know
what the future´s gonna bring right?

1182
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,510
l mean, l do love
this neighborhood.

1183
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:30,102
ln fact, you know,
two doors down,

1184
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:32,171
there´s this house
for sale.

1185
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,183
lt´s got two
big bay windows

1186
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,014
and a great rose garden.

1187
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:38,020
You know how
l love rose gardens.

1188
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:40,545
And basically,
it´s got my name all over it.

1189
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,558
l´m having my--
my-- um...

1190
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,560
real estate guy
look into it.

1191
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:46,288
She´s buying a house here?

1192
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:48,160
Two doors away.

1193
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:51,223
´´Lovely property.
Beautiful bay windows.´´

1194
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,235
lt´s bullshit!

1195
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,464
She doesn´t even like
this neighborhood.

1196
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:57,769
Oh God, l´m so exhausted.

1197
01:02:57,807 --> 01:02:59,798
She´s driving me insane!

1198
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:03,107
- l can´t do this.
- Yes, you can!

1199
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:06,047
Stop being
such a big baby.

1200
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,482
Kevin is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

1201
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:11,783
Charlie, do not
give up on this one.

1202
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:13,789
lt seems Mommy Dearest
has been keeping

1203
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:16,656
a very close eye on you,
sweetie.

1204
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:19,559
What are you talking about?
What are you doing in her clothes?

1205
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:23,053
l was just upstairs in her room
minding my own business.

1206
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:25,795
And l found all of this
in her closet.

1207
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:28,360
She´s been
investigating you.

1208
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:30,065
Whoa.

1209
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:32,370
Why does she have
your high school transcripts?

1210
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:33,875
l know.

1211
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:38,079
There´s a picture of me
at the beach?!

1212
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:39,741
- Yes, it is.
- l can´t believe that.

1213
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,909
There´s another picture
of you in here.

1214
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:43,248
And it´s-- look.

1215
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:44,844
Look at that.
lt´s like a closeup.

1216
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:47,412
But you have to be close
to take that, right?

1217
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:49,356
Look at all this Gucci!

1218
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:52,327
lt´s just
Gucci Gucci Gucci!

1219
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:55,455
She has skin caviar.
This stuff sells for $400 a jar.

1220
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,466
- l´ve heard of that. l want a try.
- Here.

1221
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,468
- Mm.
- Doesn´t that smell good?

1222
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,470
Ooh, hello.

1223
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,529
What are these?

1224
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:05,939
Those are
just her anti-anxiety pills.

1225
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:08,341
- Ooh, these are good.
- Really?

1226
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:10,777
They´d knock out a horse.
l have these at home.

1227
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:12,906
- You do?
- Wait

1228
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:16,350
l don´t know what these are.
But they´re definitely not what l take.

1229
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:18,182
They smell like
oranges or something.

1230
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:19,552
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1231
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:21,853
Let me see.

1232
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:27,591
Hi, Andy.
lt´s Charlie.

1233
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,599
Now, l´m not working
for Dr. Batel´s office this week.

1234
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:33,830
But l had a question.
Yeah, about some pills.

1235
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,497
Can l stop by?

1236
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,029
Charlie, l´m having
a bit of a bad day,

1237
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:40,702
so Ruby´s gonna take me
to see Dr. Chamberlain.

1238
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:43,507
Okay!
You take care!

1239
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,544
Let´s see
what you´re up to.

1240
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:57,083
- There you go.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

1241
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:59,594
- And thank you.
- Wear that, sister.

1242
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:02,598
Okay, now Cartier
is one right down.

1243
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:03,929
- Where´s Niketown?
- What?

1244
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:05,934
- Niketown.
- Niketown?

1245
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:07,959
Bad day, my ass.

1246
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,845
Wait a minute.

1247
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:24,682
Dr. Chamberlain?

1248
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,348
All right.

1249
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:31,786
Hello?

1250
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:33,795
Hey, Andy.

1251
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:37,265
What are they?

1252
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,201
Chewable vitamin Cs, huh?

1253
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:42,534
Okay, thanks.

1254
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:53,438
l know. l can´t believe
the wedding´s only a week away.

1255
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:57,277
No, we do the final
walk-through on Monday.

1256
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,880
Oh! Wait a minute.
l think l hear her car.

1257
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:05,122
Drop my stuff
at my house, okay?

1258
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:07,288
All right.
Look crazy.

1259
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,174
Charlie!

1260
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:29,280
Ch-ch-ch...

1261
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:31,343
Ch-ch-ahh--
Charlie!

1262
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:33,287
Oh, l had to bring him
home with me today.

1263
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,586
He´s harmless.

1264
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:37,649
Sit. No!

1265
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:39,320
No. No.

1266
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:41,592
No, Zorro! Sit!

1267
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:49,468
ls that expensive?

1268
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:53,673
lt was.

1269
01:06:57,613 --> 01:06:59,080
Sorry!

1270
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,016
Oh!

1271
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:16,522
Charlie!

1272
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:20,464
Bonus.

1273
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:24,271
Good boy.
Come on.

1274
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:26,001
Come on.

1275
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:32,308
Mmm.

1276
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:34,782
Hello, old friend.

1277
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:37,149
Viola!

1278
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:39,245
You can´t mix alcohol
with your pills!

1279
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:43,017
l´m a little upset

1280
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,027
as you can imagine.

1281
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,358
Well, l know that

1282
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,693
and l´m sorry,
but your doctor said

1283
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,665
if you´re feeling upset

1284
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:53,031
that you should take
your pills, not alcohol.

1285
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:56,232
So you relax.
l´ll get them.

1286
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:01,576
Shit.

1287
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:19,924
Here we go.

1288
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:21,930
This will make
you feel better.

1289
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:23,795
Drink up.

1290
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:29,360
Now l hope you like
what l made.

1291
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:31,771
lt´s one of my mother´s
specialties.

1292
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:39,013
- What´s that?
- Tripe.

1293
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:41,448
lt´s a delicacy.

1294
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:42,974
Try it.

1295
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:50,850
lt´s like nothing
you´ve ever tasted.

1296
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:52,520
Trust me.

1297
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,730
So Kevin called.

1298
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:01,668
He´s coming home tomorrow.
l can´t wait.

1299
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:03,331
l´m so excited.
l miss him so much.

1300
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:06,034
l was thinking maybe the three of us
could go to lunch tomorrow.

1301
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:08,043
What do you think?

1302
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:09,738
Yeah, l think it´s
a great idea too.

1303
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:11,905
l´ll make reservations.

1304
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:14,142
lt´ll be so much fun.

1305
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,051
Don´t you just love
being girlfriends?

1306
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:27,721
Night-night,
sleep tight.

1307
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:42,302
And good morning
to you too.

1308
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:47,713
- Ruby, is that you?
- ln here!

1309
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:53,016
Oh my God.
ls she all right?

1310
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:55,023
l thought she went
to bed.

1311
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:57,150
l don´t know.
l haven´t seen her like this

1312
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,161
since ´´The View´´
won an Emmy.

1313
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,356
l wish l could stay
and help

1314
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:03,763
but l´ve got to go
pick up Kevin at the airport.

1315
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:09,804
What?

1316
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:12,033
l underestimated you.

1317
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:14,167
You don´t need a gun.

1318
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:19,513
l don´t know
what you´re talking about.

1319
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:20,947
Mm-hm.

1320
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:26,280
Last call!

1321
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:32,157
We´ll see you
tomorrow night.

1322
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:35,425
Uh, there´s a reservation
under Fields, Kevin.

1323
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:37,056
Yes, right this way.

1324
01:10:37,099 --> 01:10:40,068
l´m so glad my mom and you
had a great week.

1325
01:10:40,102 --> 01:10:42,366
We did. l learned
a lot about her.

1326
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,133
So who´s
the mystery guest?

1327
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:48,072
Oh, surprise!

1328
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:51,136
l thought your office
said we were having lunch alone.

1329
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:53,774
Well, l hope you guys
forgive me. l just--

1330
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:55,943
l wanted to talk
to you and Kevin together.

1331
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:00,780
So how are you, Mom?

1332
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:02,791
Fine.

1333
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:06,693
Though l did have
a rather difficult night.

1334
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:09,789
Ooh, it was probably
that martini you had.

1335
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:11,993
Mom, you´re not supposed
to be drink alcohol

1336
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:14,662
with those pills
you´re taking.

1337
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:16,398
You know, the truth is

1338
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,531
l owe you an apology.

1339
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:21,771
You know, l was so insensitive
to your feelings

1340
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,539
about wanting to help
with the wedding.

1341
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:25,843
Oh, it´s ancient history.

1342
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:28,611
A young bride doesn´t want to hear
the opinions of an old widow.

1343
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:30,414
No no,
that is not true.

1344
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,750
l mean, you´re going
to be my mom soon.

1345
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:37,585
And a grandma shortly
after, hopefully.

1346
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:43,798
And l want you to know
that l will do anything it takes

1347
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:46,528
to make this
relationship work.

1348
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:50,063
That said...

1349
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:52,130
will you be my maid--

1350
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:54,404
l mean, my matron
of honor?

1351
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:57,469
Charlie, that´s--
that´s amazing.

1352
01:11:57,513 --> 01:11:59,572
- Mom, what do you say?
- But, uh...

1353
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:01,879
Morgan is gonna be
your maid of honor.

1354
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:05,318
Oh no, she has graciously
relinquished her title to you.

1355
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:08,346
And l had this
specially made up.

1356
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,291
A dress in your
favorite color-- peach.

1357
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:14,859
- Come on, open it.
- Well, that´s--

1358
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:16,888
Char-- ah.

1359
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,669
l-l don´t think l can.

1360
01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:25,731
Mom, l think
it´s a great idea.

1361
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:27,401
l just don´t think
l´m up to it.

1362
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:29,570
l really don´t. l´ve got
to talk to my doctor.

1363
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:31,203
Oh, l called him.
Yeah!

1364
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:33,146
And he said he thought
it was a great idea.

1365
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,275
- You called my psychiatrist?
- Mm-hmm.

1366
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:40,345
ln fact, we had lunch
at The lvy.

1367
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:42,380
Well, anyway--

1368
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:45,791
he said, considering
this turning point in your life,

1369
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:47,591
you know, losing
so much so suddenly,

1370
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:49,187
that being involved
in the future

1371
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:51,859
would be the best therapy
in the world for you right now.

1372
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,960
Careful. You know
those are strong.

1373
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:59,167
You know, we...
are your future.

1374
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,699
and we want you
to be part of it.

1375
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:06,110
l can have a list of duties
for you tomorrow.

1376
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:08,207
No.

1377
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,980
M-mom-- no, Mom.

1378
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:13,180
Mom, don´t cry.

1379
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,622
Here.

1380
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,218
Charlie.

1381
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:23,865
l didn´t think
l would be this emotional.

1382
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,526
Mom, here.
Can l?

1383
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,694
Oh, oh!

1384
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:30,170
Oh, thank you, baby.
l love you.

1385
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:32,332
- l love you too.
- l love you too!

1386
01:13:32,374 --> 01:13:34,899
l love you too, Mom.

1387
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:38,174
Kevin, you know what? Why don´t you
give your mom and l a moment alone?

1388
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:39,840
Yes, of course.

1389
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,914
Just so you know,
the crying bits are getting old.

1390
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:50,789
Just so you know,
Kevin likes his girls thin.

1391
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:53,056
Oh! Well,
l can always get liposuction.

1392
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,063
l´ve been meaning to ask.
ls it painful?

1393
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,497
That maid of honor bit.

1394
01:13:57,533 --> 01:13:59,330
Priceless!

1395
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:02,860
You know what they say? Keep your
friends close, keep your enemies closer.

1396
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:05,635
- Oh!
- Now you listen to me.

1397
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:07,642
This is my game now.

1398
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:10,804
You are going to tell Kevin that you
are not moving into our neighborhood,

1399
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:13,474
and that you´ve decided
that you´re feeling like it´s time

1400
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:15,574
that you go on
with your own life!

1401
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:18,142
You´re moving out
of our house immediately.

1402
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:20,621
This is over!

1403
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:23,647
Oh!

1404
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:27,958
This isn´t over,
not even close, girlie!

1405
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:29,463
Well, bring it on,
Grandma.

1406
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:33,834
That little bitch!

1407
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:36,235
Let´s go someplace near
the ocean and drink lunch.

1408
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:39,596
What?

1409
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,165
You know exactly what.

1410
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:43,804
Move!

1411
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,575
Move! Move!

1412
01:14:46,582 --> 01:14:48,447
What´s wrong with you?

1413
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:53,046
l am sick.
l am sick sick sick of your shit.

1414
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:55,522
And l when l´m not sick,
l´m tired.

1415
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:57,821
l am sick and tired.

1416
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:59,987
What are you saying?

1417
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:02,496
Damn you
and your luggage!

1418
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:04,965
Ruby, you´re not going
to leave me too, are you?

1419
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,764
No, l´m not leaving you!

1420
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:09,293
You old slut!

1421
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:12,667
Ruby!

1422
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:18,479
- Ruby, please--
- Hey, you almost forgot your dress!

1423
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,778
You´ll have nothing
to wear to the wedding.

1424
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:22,784
See you, Ruby!

1425
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:25,150
Maybe we can get you
a matching bonnet.

1426
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:27,747
See you
at the rehearsal dinner!

1427
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:35,688
Motherf--!

1428
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,440
So, how´s the bride-to-be
holding up?

1429
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:49,876
Ooh, under the circumstances
l´d say mediocre. But she´s tough.

1430
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:52,073
Not as tough
as the old bird.

1431
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:54,742
- What does that mean?
- For your own safety,

1432
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:59,152
make sure you know where
the emergency exits are at all times.

1433
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:03,758
Hey, are you
and my mom okay?

1434
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:06,886
Great. Yeah, l just have a little
of the pre-wedding nerves,

1435
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:08,556
but everything´s
under control.

1436
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:10,588
Of course.

1437
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:15,570
Hello, everyone!

1438
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:17,970
Welcome
to the rehearsal dinner.

1439
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:23,606
- My God, she looks amazing.
- l know.

1440
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:24,839
Oh!

1441
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,007
Father Tyson.

1442
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:29,517
Hello, Blaire.

1443
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:31,746
Kit, how are you?

1444
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:33,015
Hello, hello.

1445
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:35,853
- Oh, you are Morgan.
- Yes.

1446
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:38,758
l have heard so much about your delicious
catering service.

1447
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:40,591
Oh! Oh, wow!

1448
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:44,030
l have a lot of friends.
You´re going to be a busy girl.

1449
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:47,126
- And you´re Remy.
- Yeah.

1450
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:50,434
l recognize you from all the wonderful
things Charlie´s told me about you.

1451
01:16:50,472 --> 01:16:52,906
Wow. Well, Ms. Fields,
l have to say--

1452
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:56,775
- Oh, call me Viola. Please, l insist.
- Viola.

1453
01:16:56,812 --> 01:16:59,940
- All right, l´m gonna go get a drink.
- Okay.

1454
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:02,951
l´m such a huge fan.

1455
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:06,045
- Oh, you--
- Oh, l--

1456
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:08,989
Well, mi casa, su casa.
Make yourself at home.

1457
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:12,482
- Thank you. Bye, Viola.
- Cheers.

1458
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:14,552
- Goodbye.
- l like her a lot. Hi.

1459
01:17:14,596 --> 01:17:16,564
- Hey!
- Hi!

1460
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:19,158
- You guys have a nice little chit-chat? - Oh
my God. She came over

1461
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:21,362
and started talking to us.
What did you want us to do?

1462
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:23,030
- lgnore her?
- Yes!

1463
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,869
So then getting her autograph
would be completely out of the question?

1464
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:33,514
- Was that yes? ´Cause-- okay.
- No.

1465
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:36,312
So there l was sitting next
to the Sultan of Brunei

1466
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:39,479
with Maureen Dowd,
Carrie Fisher and Snoop Dogg.

1467
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:41,489
You know the story, Kevin.

1468
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:43,548
l said to Snoop, ´´Snoop,
l think your lyrics

1469
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:46,527
are sometimes a little
sexist and unfair to women.´´

1470
01:17:46,561 --> 01:17:49,758
And the Sultan of Brunei said,
´´Really? l have 114 wives

1471
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:51,891
and they´re all
huge fans of the Dogg!´´

1472
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,172
Honey, would you see
who´s at the door?

1473
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:02,198
Sure.

1474
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:06,005
These are delicious, Viola.

1475
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:08,016
Oh, Kit,
l´m glad you like it.

1476
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:09,950
Mm, yeah.

1477
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:11,577
Look who´s here.
lt´s Dr. Chamberlain.

1478
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:14,953
Oh my God!
lt´s Dr. Chamberlain.

1479
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:18,482
- Hi! Everybody, it´s Dr. Chamberlain!
- Hi. Good evening.

1480
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:21,121
- Thanks so much for inviting me.
- Oh, shit!

1481
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:23,927
That´s Dr. Chamberlain.
He´s Viola´s doctor.

1482
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:25,830
Oh, we´re going to need
another place setting.

1483
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:27,562
Oh, please,
let me get that.

1484
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:29,900
- There´s a chair in the living room.
- Sure.

1485
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:32,736
Scootch down, you guys.
Come on, make room.

1486
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:34,639
You guys move down.

1487
01:18:34,676 --> 01:18:36,644
Cheers. Thank you.

1488
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:37,838
Who´s he?

1489
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:41,076
lt´s Viola´s therapist.
Move down, you guys!

1490
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:44,085
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

1491
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:47,418
- Here´s you chair, Doctor.
- Here. Have mine, too.

1492
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:49,287
Hello.

1493
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:50,450
Hi.

1494
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:52,483
- Hi.
- Hi.

1495
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:56,386
l´ll get it.

1496
01:18:56,431 --> 01:18:58,763
So you just got here?

1497
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,267
- Are you expecting anyone else?
- Huh-uh.

1498
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:02,862
- Hello, everybody!
- Fiona!

1499
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:04,963
l´m so glad to see you.

1500
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:07,736
l just couldn´t resist
bringing the happy couple

1501
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:09,744
a little gift.

1502
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:13,009
That´s great. l will
get you a place setting.

1503
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:15,448
She´s bringing a gift?
l think she is the gift.

1504
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:17,509
What the hell
is she doing here?

1505
01:19:17,552 --> 01:19:20,783
- How about some more wine, everyone?
- Yeah!

1506
01:19:20,822 --> 01:19:23,586
How much longer do we have to stay?
l have midterms tomorrow.

1507
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:25,149
Shh.

1508
01:19:25,193 --> 01:19:27,957
- Oh, l get it.
- No, baby, not now, okay?

1509
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:30,021
lt´s not the time.

1510
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:32,295
So, Dr. Chamberlain,

1511
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:35,064
tell us about med school.
Where did you do your residency?

1512
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:37,469
Uh, now that´s--
that´s a long story.

1513
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:39,064
l don´t think your guests
want to hear that.

1514
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:40,335
No, we really
want to know.

1515
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:42,275
l think we need
some more gravy.

1516
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:49,484
What is going on?

1517
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,452
What are you doing?

1518
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:53,545
l´m behaving.

1519
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:54,885
Viola, no!

1520
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:57,414
You can´t!
Charlie´s allergic to nuts!

1521
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:59,120
Give it to me!

1522
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:07,761
Viola, you´re crazy.

1523
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:13,935
Oh, get up.

1524
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:16,205
Put the gravy down
or l´m telling Kevin.

1525
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:18,803
Yeah!

1526
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:22,883
What´s the big deal?
So her face swells up--

1527
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:24,818
swells up a little.
So what?

1528
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:27,947
Swells up a little? Her face´ll
blow up like a Macy´s Day balloon.

1529
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:30,287
Well, good. lt´ll match
the other body parts!

1530
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:33,692
Viola, think about
what you´re doing.

1531
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:35,992
Come on, the girl´s
getting married tomorrow!

1532
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:37,692
Ruby, when did you
lose your edge?

1533
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:39,359
Right after
you lost your mind.

1534
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:41,631
Come on.

1535
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,262
All right. Okay.
No nuts.

1536
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:44,795
Come on.

1537
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,206
Viola, l think you
dislocated my vagina.

1538
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:49,210
- Where´s the--
- Where´s the what?

1539
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:50,541
Gravy? More gravy?

1540
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:52,547
Anyone for more gravy?

1541
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:55,607
Oh, l am not
doing time for you!

1542
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:57,743
- Where´s the back door?
- Stay cool, Ruby!

1543
01:20:57,786 --> 01:20:59,310
Stay cool! This is no time
to lose your nerve.

1544
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:01,345
lf l get arrested
l´m gonna sing like a canary.

1545
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:03,448
Maybe she won´t
take any gravy.

1546
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:05,686
- That´s a lot of gravy.
- Mmm!

1547
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:07,922
This gravy´s delicious!

1548
01:21:09,064 --> 01:21:11,055
You-- you gotta go
stop her!

1549
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:14,159
- Go on, stop her. Go stop her.
- You go, you go, you go.

1550
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:15,999
Why me?
You´re the culprit? You go!

1551
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:18,665
- You´re my assistant.
- What am l supposed to do?

1552
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,436
Go out there and stick my finger
down her throat?

1553
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:22,067
Yeah.

1554
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:24,742
Baby, are you okay?

1555
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:27,145
Kevin, my tongue
feels weird.

1556
01:21:27,182 --> 01:21:28,774
l think
something´s wrong!

1557
01:21:28,817 --> 01:21:30,546
Charlie, are you okay?

1558
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:33,486
- What are we gonna do now?
- Hide the damn nuts!

1559
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:38,151
- Are you all right?
- Get her some water.

1560
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:45,226
Flat or sparkling?

1561
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:47,895
The caterer says he doesn´t know how
this could have happened.

1562
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:51,030
Well, l feel like l ate
a loaf of nuts.

1563
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:53,632
l mean, even my tongue
is swollen.

1564
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:56,776
You´re marrying
a big, fat, puffy tomato mouth.

1565
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:04,181
lt´s not that bad, really. Besides,
the swelling´s already going down.

1566
01:22:04,219 --> 01:22:06,414
- Yeah?
- Hey, Kev.

1567
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:08,046
- Yeah.
- Just coming to check up

1568
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:10,057
on the bride-to-be.
For the love of God--

1569
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:12,321
- Out!
- You see?

1570
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,555
l told you it looks terrible.

1571
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:16,461
- l told you.
- Baby, l promise you.

1572
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:18,989
ln 24 hours the swelling
will be completely gone.

1573
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:20,831
Give me that!

1574
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,387
Door was open.

1575
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:50,455
Oh thank God.

1576
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:53,296
- The Bride of Frankenstein is gone.
- l know.

1577
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:55,462
l was up half
the night worrying.

1578
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:57,767
- You look great.
- l just don´t know

1579
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,865
- how those nuts got in there.
- Yeah.

1580
01:22:59,908 --> 01:23:02,536
Hmm.
Wait.

1581
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:04,135
Hey, do you think
she would--

1582
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,677
No!

1583
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:10,207
Come on.

1584
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:12,116
l mean, she´s crazy,

1585
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:14,451
but she´s not like,
psycho-killer crazy.

1586
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:15,478
Hmm.

1587
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:19,283
No!

1588
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:24,165
Oh, hey, l was wondering.
Could l bring a date

1589
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:26,167
to your wedding?

1590
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:28,692
Of course. My God.
How exciting.

1591
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:31,137
Great. Thanks.
So then, l´ll see you later.

1592
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:32,764
But-- w-wait!

1593
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:34,934
- Who is he? Tell me!
- Oh, it´s--

1594
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:38,173
okay, don´t be mad.
lt´s Dr. Chamberlain.

1595
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:40,181
Actually ´´Paul.´´

1596
01:23:40,215 --> 01:23:43,048
- ls that his real name?
- That´s very funny.

1597
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:45,052
l gotta go get a mani, pedi
and my eyebrows waxed.

1598
01:23:45,086 --> 01:23:47,816
But l´ll see you in
a couple hours, okay?

1599
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:49,221
- Oh, let me go down with you.
- Okay.

1600
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:50,781
Oh God.

1601
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:58,055
She added
even more ruffles!

1602
01:23:58,099 --> 01:24:00,363
Where´s your prom date,
senorita?

1603
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:05,533
Oh, wait a minute. This is too
damn good. Where´s my camera?

1604
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:07,063
This is just too good.

1605
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:10,009
Will you just get me
out of this right now?

1606
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:11,876
Come here.

1607
01:24:29,464 --> 01:24:31,261
- Cheers.
- Hey.

1608
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:34,431
Thanks for coming.

1609
01:24:34,469 --> 01:24:36,903
Okay, guys, let´s go see
how Charlie´s doing.

1610
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:39,031
Ah, yes, please.

1611
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,666
Uh-huh.

1612
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:43,575
Oh my God. Those are
so much better than mine.

1613
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:52,720
Don´t... touch me!

1614
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:55,450
l got out of that car
the same way l got in it--

1615
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:59,153
without you.
Now where is she?

1616
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:07,835
You here with the bride
or the groom?

1617
01:25:07,869 --> 01:25:09,837
l´m here with my mother.

1618
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:11,600
Oh.

1619
01:25:15,977 --> 01:25:17,467
She looked a lot older. l--

1620
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:23,108
Well, look
what we have here.

1621
01:25:23,151 --> 01:25:25,142
Oh my God.

1622
01:25:26,354 --> 01:25:28,447
You look beautiful.
Oh my God.

1623
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:30,515
- Oh my God.
- This is it!

1624
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:32,458
Yeah!

1625
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:34,894
- Oh God, did you talk to the priest?
- l talked to him.

1626
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:37,056
He´s just going
to skip right over that whole

1627
01:25:37,098 --> 01:25:39,191
- ´´if anyone should object´´ part.
- Okay.

1628
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:42,761
You´re a vision in white,
sweetie, really.

1629
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:46,399
Knock knock.
Look at you!

1630
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:50,207
And so is your
mother-in-law.

1631
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:52,338
Mm. Mm-mm-mm.

1632
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:55,574
All right.
Everybody out.

1633
01:25:55,617 --> 01:25:57,778
Out.
Give the bride a moment.

1634
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:03,586
- No way.
- What?

1635
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:10,960
What is that?

1636
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:13,695
- What?
- Where´s your bridesmaid´s dress?

1637
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:16,135
Oh, l gave it
to Ruby´s daughter.

1638
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,105
She works at Hooters.
She was thrilled.

1639
01:26:18,139 --> 01:26:20,198
l don´t have a daughter?

1640
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:21,868
Oh.

1641
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:23,241
Rude.

1642
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:27,239
Take off that
white dress right now

1643
01:26:27,282 --> 01:26:30,649
or l´ll take it off
for you.

1644
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:33,017
Don´t you tell me
what to do!

1645
01:26:33,054 --> 01:26:35,955
You did not
just poke me!

1646
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:38,515
Don´t you touch me,
you two-bit tramp!

1647
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:42,719
Oh my God!
Viola, l´m so sorry.

1648
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:45,392
l didn´t mean to--

1649
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:47,663
You don´t go and slap somebody
then apologize.

1650
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:49,260
Get some backbone!

1651
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:57,805
God! This is crazy!

1652
01:26:57,845 --> 01:26:59,540
Why don´t you just
face it?

1653
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:02,015
l´m marrying Kevin today and there´s
nothing you can do about it.

1654
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:05,076
You face it! You´ll never be
good enough for him!

1655
01:27:05,186 --> 01:27:07,814
Didn´t stop you
from marrying my son.

1656
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:11,416
- Oh God, no.
- Well, look at you.

1657
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:13,427
All in white.

1658
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:16,021
You are so predictable.

1659
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:18,862
Oh, Gertrude.
l didn´t know you were coming.

1660
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,128
You didn´t?

1661
01:27:20,168 --> 01:27:23,160
Wonder why.
Oh, l know.

1662
01:27:23,204 --> 01:27:26,037
You didn´t send me
an invitation!

1663
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,507
l thought you
were dead.

1664
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:29,533
But evil doesn´t die
so easily.

1665
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:32,512
l heard you got sacked
and thrown into a loony bin.

1666
01:27:32,547 --> 01:27:34,845
- Oh! Oh!
- My congratulations.

1667
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:36,713
Oh my God.

1668
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:38,719
Oh my God!

1669
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:40,687
These hors d´oeuvres
taste like old socks.

1670
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:44,925
Now, l want to get

1671
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:47,086
an up-close look
at the bride.

1672
01:27:47,128 --> 01:27:48,755
Holy Toledo!

1673
01:27:48,796 --> 01:27:51,890
You are a stunner!

1674
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:54,094
My grandson
is a lucky fellah.

1675
01:27:54,135 --> 01:27:55,432
Look, what he did.

1676
01:27:55,470 --> 01:28:00,066
He went out and found
himself an exotic Latina!

1677
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:03,503
Would that my son
had been that lucky.

1678
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:05,239
Here we go again.

1679
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,340
What? You were
a television weatherwoman

1680
01:28:08,383 --> 01:28:09,680
in Dubuque, Montana.

1681
01:28:09,717 --> 01:28:12,117
You drove around
in a broken-down minivan

1682
01:28:12,153 --> 01:28:15,452
and you drank red wine
from a box!

1683
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:19,625
Classy.

1684
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:21,629
You killed him,
you know?

1685
01:28:21,663 --> 01:28:23,631
- What?!
- You killed him.

1686
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:25,633
All the doctors agreed,

1687
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:29,194
my son died
of terminal disappointment!

1688
01:28:29,237 --> 01:28:31,364
lf anybody killed him,
you did.

1689
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:33,169
You smothered him
to death!

1690
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:34,970
Nobody was ever
good enough for him!

1691
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:39,036
My God, you look old!

1692
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:42,442
Fine.

1693
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:45,384
This woman is going
to drive me insane.

1694
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:48,821
Now, l´d rather not
take all the credit.

1695
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,150
You´ll get over it.

1696
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:59,163
- Okay, l love you.
- You´re kidding.

1697
01:29:12,747 --> 01:29:15,307
This is never gonna end, is it?

1698
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:18,717
l mean, that´s going
to be me and you in 30 years.

1699
01:29:18,753 --> 01:29:21,916
We´ll be doing
the exact same thing.

1700
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:26,850
You know what?

1701
01:29:28,663 --> 01:29:32,099
l wanted to marry Kevin
because we make each other happy.

1702
01:29:32,133 --> 01:29:35,125
But you´re never gonna
let that happen.

1703
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:37,160
Are you?

1704
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:42,441
Oh my God.
l can´t believe l´m saying this.

1705
01:29:47,348 --> 01:29:49,543
You win, Viola.

1706
01:29:50,952 --> 01:29:52,920
What do you mean?

1707
01:29:52,954 --> 01:29:54,478
The wedding´s off.

1708
01:29:56,124 --> 01:29:58,115
Bye, Ruby.

1709
01:30:01,195 --> 01:30:04,062
l-l cannot believe
she compared me to Gertrude.

1710
01:30:04,098 --> 01:30:07,067
l know.
Now that´s just wrong.

1711
01:30:07,101 --> 01:30:09,729
- Thank you.
- You are far worse.

1712
01:30:09,771 --> 01:30:13,070
l don´t recall Gertrude
ever trying to poison you.

1713
01:30:13,107 --> 01:30:15,575
And l´m pretty sure
she wore black to your wedding.

1714
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:17,908
Black. Yeah, she said
she was in mourning.

1715
01:30:17,945 --> 01:30:19,810
Mm-hmm.

1716
01:30:19,847 --> 01:30:22,475
l just want my son
to be happy.

1717
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:25,543
Whatever made you
think he wasn´t?

1718
01:30:34,362 --> 01:30:36,353
Hey, what are you
doing here?

1719
01:30:36,397 --> 01:30:39,127
Don´t you know it´s
bad luck to see the--

1720
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:41,158
Charlie, what´s wrong?

1721
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:45,501
What is it?

1722
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:47,132
Are you nervous?

1723
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:48,972
Hey.

1724
01:30:51,312 --> 01:30:53,473
- Kevin, l need--
- Charlie,

1725
01:30:53,514 --> 01:30:55,539
l need to talk to you.

1726
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:58,575
- Viola, stop it!
- lt´s the flower girls.

1727
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:01,645
- They´re drunk again.
- What?

1728
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:03,350
Yeah, in the toilet.

1729
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:05,052
Not now, Viola, okay?

1730
01:31:05,092 --> 01:31:06,787
lt´s really important.

1731
01:31:06,828 --> 01:31:08,989
Just give us a minute.
She´ll be right there.

1732
01:31:10,998 --> 01:31:12,966
Please?

1733
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,991
Charlie, what is it?

1734
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:21,408
l´ll be right back.

1735
01:31:26,747 --> 01:31:28,738
What do you want, Viola?

1736
01:31:30,551 --> 01:31:33,076
l don´t want you
to walk out on this wedding.

1737
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,678
You don´t?

1738
01:31:34,722 --> 01:31:37,020
No, l don´t.

1739
01:31:37,058 --> 01:31:39,686
What, am l supposed to believe
that you´ve had some epiphany?

1740
01:31:39,727 --> 01:31:42,287
That all of the sudden,
everything is going to be different?

1741
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:44,321
lt´s never been
about you, Charlie.

1742
01:31:44,365 --> 01:31:46,265
lt´s me.

1743
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:48,234
l´ve been so afraid
of losing him.

1744
01:31:48,269 --> 01:31:50,601
He´s the only family
l´ve got.

1745
01:31:50,638 --> 01:31:55,098
This is my chance
for a family, too.

1746
01:31:55,142 --> 01:31:57,133
- And l´m scared.
- Oh!

1747
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:59,544
Don´t blow your chance
for happiness.

1748
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:01,480
You´ve never needed
my approval.

1749
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:03,780
He´s loved you
from the very beginning.

1750
01:32:05,086 --> 01:32:08,055
And l promise l will
get out of the way

1751
01:32:08,089 --> 01:32:09,556
and let the two of you
be happy.

1752
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:11,751
That´s not what l want.

1753
01:32:11,792 --> 01:32:15,250
l mean, there just has
to be some boundaries, Viola.

1754
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:16,627
l can do boundaries!

1755
01:32:18,266 --> 01:32:21,565
l don´t love boundaries
but l can do them.

1756
01:32:21,602 --> 01:32:24,969
How about the number of times
you call Kevin a day?

1757
01:32:25,006 --> 01:32:27,133
Can we limit that
to, like, one?

1758
01:32:27,174 --> 01:32:30,268
Oh, l need at least
four minimum.

1759
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:32,575
- He´s 35 years old.
- Three?

1760
01:32:32,613 --> 01:32:34,638
- Two.
- Deal.

1761
01:32:34,682 --> 01:32:37,708
Two long-ass calls!

1762
01:32:37,752 --> 01:32:39,845
When Kevin and l
have kids,

1763
01:32:39,887 --> 01:32:42,117
he and l will decide
how they´re raised.

1764
01:32:42,156 --> 01:32:45,284
All right. But you know l have
raised one wonderful boy.

1765
01:32:45,326 --> 01:32:48,022
- And my advice could be very--
- Will be solicited when needed.

1766
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:50,997
All right, as long as one kid
is named after me.

1767
01:32:51,032 --> 01:32:53,933
- Middle name.
- Deal.

1768
01:32:53,968 --> 01:32:55,401
What else?

1769
01:32:55,436 --> 01:32:57,927
Holidays
and special occasions.

1770
01:32:57,972 --> 01:33:00,338
Are you gonna keep
me away?

1771
01:33:00,374 --> 01:33:04,640
You must be present
for every Christmas,

1772
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:08,115
Thanksgiving,
birthday,

1773
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:11,209
school play,
clarinet recital

1774
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:14,619
and soccer game
in our kids´ lives.

1775
01:33:15,856 --> 01:33:18,381
l want you to love them
and spoil them

1776
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:20,758
and teach them things
that Kevin and l can´t.

1777
01:33:21,996 --> 01:33:23,930
Like how to throw
a right hook for example.

1778
01:33:27,535 --> 01:33:29,503
l want you there, Viola.

1779
01:33:29,537 --> 01:33:32,597
l do, up front and center.

1780
01:33:34,475 --> 01:33:37,467
From this point
l will not negotiate.

1781
01:33:37,511 --> 01:33:41,106
Damn. That girl can give
a nice little speech.

1782
01:33:42,850 --> 01:33:44,374
Deal?

1783
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:47,612
Oh--

1784
01:33:47,655 --> 01:33:50,249
can they call me ´´Aunt Viola´´
instead of ´´Grandma´´?

1785
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:52,953
Fine.

1786
01:34:02,837 --> 01:34:05,237
Come on, unzip me.

1787
01:34:05,272 --> 01:34:07,934
Viola, you don´t
have to wear that dress, really.

1788
01:34:08,943 --> 01:34:11,036
Yes, l do. Really.

1789
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:18,083
Go, Kevin and Charlie!

1790
01:34:24,258 --> 01:34:25,247
Yeah!

1791
01:34:41,108 --> 01:34:44,441
Mom!

1792
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:46,343
Do you really think l would leave without
saying goodbye?

1793
01:34:48,783 --> 01:34:50,910
l love you, Mom.

1794
01:34:50,951 --> 01:34:53,351
- Thanks for everything.
- Go.

1795
01:34:54,588 --> 01:34:56,146
Bye, you guys!

1796
01:34:58,225 --> 01:35:00,955
Okay, everybody gather around
the back of the car!

1797
01:35:01,962 --> 01:35:03,987
Charlie!

1798
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:06,329
Charlie, right here!
Right here, Charlie!

1799
01:35:25,352 --> 01:35:27,252
Sheesh.

1800
01:35:27,288 --> 01:35:30,621
- Oh, Hawaii! l cannot wait!
- l know. l can´t either.

1801
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,125
Have a great
time in Hawaii!

1802
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:36,254
- Good luck!
- Have fun in Hawaii!

1803
01:35:40,601 --> 01:35:42,762
Just you and me
now, Ruby!

1804
01:35:42,803 --> 01:35:46,967
Jesus. Who did l kill
in a past life?

1805
01:35:47,007 --> 01:35:49,305
And take off
that damn dress.

1806
01:35:49,343 --> 01:35:50,901
You look like
a giant peach cobbler.

1807
01:35:50,945 --> 01:35:52,879
You´re making me hungry.

1808
01:35:52,913 --> 01:35:56,041
Come on, weathergirl,
l´ll buy you a box of wine.

1809
01:36:00,888 --> 01:36:03,186
For once in my life

1810
01:36:03,557 --> 01:36:06,685
l have someone
who needs me

1811
01:36:06,727 --> 01:36:10,561
Someone l needed
so long

1812
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:12,623
For once, unafraid

1813
01:36:12,666 --> 01:36:15,692
l can go
where life leads me

1814
01:36:15,736 --> 01:36:19,467
Somehow l know
l´ll be strong

1815
01:36:19,507 --> 01:36:21,202
For once, l can touch

1816
01:36:21,242 --> 01:36:24,370
What my heart
used to dream of

1817
01:36:24,411 --> 01:36:28,142
Long before l knew

1818
01:36:28,182 --> 01:36:32,642
Oh, someone warm
like you

1819
01:36:32,686 --> 01:36:35,382
Would make my dream
come true

1820
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:37,481
-  Yeah yeah yeah
-  For once in our lives

1821
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:39,356
For once in my life

1822
01:36:39,393 --> 01:36:41,759
l won´t let sorrow
hurt me

1823
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:44,196
Not like it´s hurt me
before

1824
01:36:44,231 --> 01:36:46,199
Not like
it´s hurt before

1825
01:36:46,233 --> 01:36:48,201
For once,
l have something

1826
01:36:48,235 --> 01:36:50,795
l know won´t
desert me

1827
01:36:50,838 --> 01:36:55,002
-  l´m not alone anymore
-  l´m not alone

1828
01:36:55,042 --> 01:36:57,010
For once, l can say

1829
01:36:57,044 --> 01:36:59,410
´´This is mine,
you can´t take it´´

1830
01:36:59,446 --> 01:37:03,439
As long as l know
l have love l can make it

1831
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:05,645
For once in my life

1832
01:37:05,686 --> 01:37:08,587
l have someone
who needs me

1833
01:37:08,622 --> 01:37:11,022
Someone who needs me

1834
01:37:11,058 --> 01:37:12,958
Ah-hah-hah,
hey yeah!

1835
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:15,621
Someone who needs me

1836
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:17,528
All l need
is love, baby

1837
01:37:24,905 --> 01:37:26,896
For once in my life

1838
01:37:49,763 --> 01:37:52,425
Make our dreams
come true

1839
01:37:52,466 --> 01:37:54,661
-  For once in my life
-  For once in my life

1840
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:57,296
l won´t let
sorrow hurt me

1841
01:37:57,338 --> 01:38:00,739
-  Not like it´s hurt me before
-  Not like it hurt before

1842
01:38:00,774 --> 01:38:02,867
For once, l have something

1843
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:05,879
l know won´t desert me

1844
01:38:05,913 --> 01:38:09,644
-  l´m not alone anymore
-  l´m not alone anymore

1845
01:38:09,683 --> 01:38:11,651
For once l can say

1846
01:38:11,685 --> 01:38:14,176
´´This is mine,
you can´t take it´´

1847
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:18,123
Long as l know
l have love l can make it

1848
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:20,217
For once in my life

1849
01:38:20,261 --> 01:38:23,560
l have someone
who needs me

1850
01:38:23,597 --> 01:38:25,827
-  Someone who needs me
-  Oh

1851
01:38:25,866 --> 01:38:27,697
For once in my life

1852
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:30,135
-  Someone who needs me
-  Yeah

1853
01:38:30,170 --> 01:38:32,035
Somebody that needs me

1854
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:35,064
-  Someone who needs me
-  For once in my life.

1855
01:38:44,118 --> 01:38:48,452
You can cry
a million tears

1856
01:38:48,489 --> 01:38:53,188
You can wait
a million years

1857
01:38:53,227 --> 01:38:58,494
lf you think that time
will change your ways

1858
01:38:58,532 --> 01:39:02,559
Don´t wait too long

1859
01:39:02,603 --> 01:39:06,869
When your morning
turns to night

1860
01:39:06,907 --> 01:39:10,866
Who´ll be loving you
by candlelight?

1861
01:39:10,911 --> 01:39:16,611
lf you think that time
will change your ways

1862
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:20,609
Don´t wait too long

1863
01:39:20,654 --> 01:39:25,523
Maybe l´ve got a lot
to learn

1864
01:39:25,559 --> 01:39:28,027
Time can slip away

1865
01:39:30,030 --> 01:39:33,989
Sometimes you´ve got
to lose it all

1866
01:39:34,034 --> 01:39:37,094
Before you find
your way

1867
01:39:39,506 --> 01:39:43,135
Take a chance
and play your part

1868
01:39:43,177 --> 01:39:47,807
Make romance,
it might break your heart

1869
01:39:47,848 --> 01:39:53,514
But if you think time
will change your ways

1870
01:39:53,554 --> 01:39:56,523
Don´t wait too long

1871
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:19,468
Baby, you and l´ve got
a lot to learn

1872
01:40:19,513 --> 01:40:23,210
Don´t want to waste
another day

1873
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:28,819
Maybe you got
to lose it all

1874
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:33,486
Before you find
your way

1875
01:40:33,527 --> 01:40:37,827
Take a chance,
play your part

1876
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:42,495
Make romance,
it might break your heart

1877
01:40:42,536 --> 01:40:47,439
But if you think time
will change your ways

1878
01:40:47,474 --> 01:40:51,137
Don´t wait too long

1879
01:40:53,347 --> 01:40:55,611
Don´t wait

1880
01:41:01,255 --> 01:41:03,223
Yeah.

1881
01:41:03,257 --> 01:41:06,249
Gettin´ old.
