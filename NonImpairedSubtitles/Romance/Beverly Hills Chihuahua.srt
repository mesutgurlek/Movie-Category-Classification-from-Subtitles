1
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:41,480
Good morning.

2
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:44,179
Oh, hello who likes to see you.

3
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,679
Oh, look there is.

4
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:47,056
Is she?

5
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:50,091
Dude, if I would be nervous.

6
00:01:50,563 --> 00:01:53,361
His fabulous bag, she is so refined.

7
00:01:55,768 --> 00:01:56,632
Sorry, I arrived late.

8
00:01:57,136 --> 00:01:58,433
We had to go shopping.

9
00:01:58,938 --> 00:02:01,668
Go to right, I'm so tired.

10
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:03,503
Go my friend.

11
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:05,740
Lui Buton, never saw so well.

12
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:09,337
Tell me if that Liston color is not real.

13
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:10,739
I would say beautiful.

14
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,284
I had to strive to have it.

15
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:15,783
Sorry to make you wait.

16
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:17,455
Okay.

17
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:19,218
Fix what you can.

18
00:02:19,258 --> 00:02:21,692
But I need the list, because
we will have a luncheon at 1.

19
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:23,251
I'm sure it will be ready.

20
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:25,729
I know darling, you also miss.

21
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:27,929
Cuidala well, no scolding.

22
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:29,363
Ok.

23
00:02:29,869 --> 00:02:31,666
I hope you give me a red bone.

24
00:02:31,704 --> 00:02:33,331
I want to do better today.

25
00:02:33,372 --> 00:02:35,431
It has an appointment, go.

26
00:02:35,474 --> 00:02:36,668
Nice pedigree.

27
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:39,269
Please, this dog is pursuing cars.

28
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:41,836
It's better than a doodle.

29
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:43,746
I give it a week.

30
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:45,647
Hey, talk to my leg.

31
00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:47,515
Good for you.

32
00:02:47,553 --> 00:02:49,418
It is not easy to deal with the newspapers.

33
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:52,020
But it is when you can laugh.

34
00:02:52,057 --> 00:02:56,050
I would be happy with one. Arréglenlo.

35
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:04,965
Rogue.

36
00:03:13,345 --> 00:03:14,277
Ok, how about girls?

37
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,169
What do you think of this?

38
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:18,115
OH please do not go with your hair.

39
00:03:18,183 --> 00:03:19,548
This?

40
00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:22,813
That is, took me 2. Let's see.

41
00:03:22,855 --> 00:03:26,484
We will leave at least 2
day until you find something.

42
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:28,458
If you get something.

43
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:30,025
Perfect.

44
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:31,762
Something of Armany.

45
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:34,823
Oh, and he left.

46
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:35,834
Sure.

47
00:03:35,868 --> 00:03:36,766
Small beauty.

48
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:38,201
This?

49
00:03:38,237 --> 00:03:39,204
Is allergic to that.

50
00:03:39,238 --> 00:03:40,205
What do you think?

51
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,400
I love that.

52
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:43,408
Fabulous.

53
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:46,240
Love, Love?

54
00:03:46,278 --> 00:03:48,746
Oh, I'll give you everything you want.

55
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:50,214
Yes.

56
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,540
No, no to you Patrick.

57
00:03:53,786 --> 00:03:55,686
Hi Jacky.

58
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,567
I love this smell, in the morning.

59
00:04:11,403 --> 00:04:12,335
Beautiful.

60
00:04:12,705 --> 00:04:15,401
I loved the new design that did.

61
00:04:15,441 --> 00:04:16,567
Thank you.

62
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:17,336
Your welcome.

63
00:04:17,343 --> 00:04:18,970
For everything. Seriously.

64
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:20,603
For giving me the opportunity
to be myself.

65
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:22,477
Oh, Daddy Good job.

66
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:24,004
Very symmetrical.

67
00:04:28,954 --> 00:04:29,682
Yes, yes.

68
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:31,246
Well done Daddy.

69
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:36,317
Go Daddy to rest,
You did good friend.

70
00:04:46,505 --> 00:04:47,631
Hello beautiful.

71
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,338
Blocking my sunshine.

72
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:55,236
That the sun shines more.

73
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,840
Why do not you my wife?

74
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:00,850
What is that smell?.

75
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:01,910
What?

76
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:03,679
The sweat on my tail.

77
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:05,656
Oh, the macho that I have for you.

78
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:06,623
None.

79
00:05:06,658 --> 00:05:08,819
So ... should be the fertilizer.

80
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:10,260
Rude.

81
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:12,627
You're covered with that.

82
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:13,756
Clear.

83
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:16,393
I am a escabador.

84
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:21,100
An appetizer my heart.

85
00:05:21,707 --> 00:05:22,901
I got it myself.

86
00:05:23,342 --> 00:05:24,366
Very sabrozo.

87
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,901
This is very annoying.

88
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:28,644
I am tempted.

89
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,350
I leave here in case
you change your mind.

90
00:05:32,384 --> 00:05:33,715
Sorry we have guests.

91
00:05:33,752 --> 00:05:35,276
Yes. Your guests.

92
00:05:36,822 --> 00:05:38,517
Do you want to go have a drink later?

93
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:40,115
There is a good place for the garage.

94
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,059
Okay, forget it.

95
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:44,191
I am here.

96
00:05:44,496 --> 00:05:46,123
1 hour late as usual.

97
00:05:46,165 --> 00:05:47,154
Hello.

98
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:49,131
How do you keep your job?

99
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:52,201
Oh, sure you do not preserved.

100
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:54,899
Where is it? Where is it?

101
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,929
Go to find it.

102
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:57,066
Come on, go get it.

103
00:05:57,876 --> 00:05:59,343
Am I Lassie?

104
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:01,310
You are not very useful.

105
00:06:01,346 --> 00:06:02,973
Yes, I understand.

106
00:06:03,015 --> 00:06:07,008
It's just that I wanted to
promote a new cosmetic.

107
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:09,644
These are news
wonderful. They are the best.

108
00:06:10,222 --> 00:06:11,018
Yes.

109
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:12,853
Okay, great. Adios.

110
00:06:15,227 --> 00:06:16,057
Is everything all right?

111
00:06:17,496 --> 00:06:18,622
Oh, dear.

112
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:20,398
I do not know how I will.

113
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:22,161
Yo, I took a plane at 4 o'clock.

114
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:23,429
And we were stuck.

115
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:26,905
And the nanny of Chloe, was
3 weeks before your baby.

116
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,503
You 're not going with Chloe.

117
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,907
No, obviously he was on vacation.

118
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:35,141
But this is a business trip.

119
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,478
For the city, for 10 days.

120
00:06:37,516 --> 00:06:39,279
She is very sensitive.

121
00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:41,784
In addition comb his hair.

122
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,151
Leave caregiver.

123
00:06:43,188 --> 00:06:44,155
Caregiver.

124
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:45,588
No, no.

125
00:06:47,192 --> 00:06:49,092
Never leave in the
the hands of a stranger.

126
00:06:49,128 --> 00:06:51,619
Never, not in a million years.

127
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:54,623
But you are not a stranger.

128
00:06:56,435 --> 00:06:57,231
What?

129
00:06:57,636 --> 00:06:58,432
What?

130
00:06:59,905 --> 00:07:03,705
Here is the schedule of Cloe.

131
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:04,834
Try to accomplish as much as possible.

132
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:06,538
Oh, but you can skip
Wednesday of this.

133
00:07:06,578 --> 00:07:08,011
Just please.

134
00:07:08,046 --> 00:07:10,480
I'm going to trust you.

135
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:12,643
My greatest treasure.

136
00:07:13,852 --> 00:07:15,114
Cuidala well.

137
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:16,483
I love you sweetheart.

138
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:18,152
I love you so much.

139
00:07:20,926 --> 00:07:21,722
Adios.

140
00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:23,393
Fun both.

141
00:07:23,428 --> 00:07:24,952
Ok, goodbye.

142
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:29,623
¿Day games?

143
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:36,363
Oh ... good luck.

144
00:07:56,528 --> 00:07:58,189
Do not worry Chloe.

145
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,427
She will return soon
that you know it.

146
00:08:00,465 --> 00:08:01,955
It is not that bad.

147
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:04,465
You do not know anything.

148
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:07,095
It's so cute in his little outfit.

149
00:08:07,172 --> 00:08:09,333
She is not the case, is a pig.

150
00:08:09,374 --> 00:08:11,535
Rachel spoke of chiuahua.

151
00:08:11,577 --> 00:08:13,135
Angela is not a chihuahua.

152
00:08:13,178 --> 00:08:17,171
She is a scrub, arrogant,
and manipulative of chiuhahua

153
00:08:18,317 --> 00:08:19,147
Beverly Hills.

154
00:08:19,184 --> 00:08:22,085
She has no leadership, no
can keep a job.

155
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,109
Never arrive on time.

156
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:25,589
I can not be late to all my appointments.

157
00:08:25,624 --> 00:08:27,023
You know how he began his schedule?

158
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:30,994
With their massages, party
birthday parties for dogs.

159
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:32,929
Nonsense.

160
00:08:32,965 --> 00:08:34,125
And I have to change 4 times a day.

161
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,030
Look at him.

162
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:38,127
- She is so ...
- She is so ...

163
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,102
lrresponsable.

164
00:08:39,137 --> 00:08:40,570
Dispossession.

165
00:08:40,606 --> 00:08:42,301
I need refrezcarme.

166
00:08:42,341 --> 00:08:43,239
Good girl.

167
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,576
Hi Mom.

168
00:08:51,016 --> 00:08:53,041
Who is that attractive
chiuahua from there?

169
00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:57,078
Oh, the gardener.

170
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:01,248
You're adorable.

171
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:02,419
Than ever.

172
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:03,824
Wow.

173
00:09:09,735 --> 00:09:10,565
Perhaps it is already gone.

174
00:09:10,602 --> 00:09:11,933
Sorry.

175
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,369
I just ...

178
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:20,843
Hey bird.

179
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,006
That is a hot dog.

180
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:25,016
Excuse me Miss.

181
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,448
Good legs.

00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:32,753

184
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:34,855
Gardener.

185
00:09:36,561 --> 00:09:39,724
Your dog is bad, very bad.

186
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:41,027
Very dirty.

187
00:09:45,237 --> 00:09:49,230
Can you get your dog here?

188
00:09:53,612 --> 00:09:54,510
But my heart has to speak.

189
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:57,446
Just want to say.

190
00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:01,942
If you know someone who
lamba inside your ears.

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,612
Oh, you take the most expensive.

192
00:10:05,657 --> 00:10:08,683
Or, share a moment in the sun.

193
00:10:09,628 --> 00:10:12,995
I will have the honor degree of
to be with someone special.

194
00:10:13,031 --> 00:10:15,329
Keep your tongue.

195
00:10:17,436 --> 00:10:21,031
I do not think so Daddy.

00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:24,038
You mean not now.

Oh, where are we going?

00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:08,303

This is good for 1 thing only.

240
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:46,703
Try it yourself.

241
00:13:51,983 --> 00:13:53,211
Bad dog.

242
00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:55,082
Very bad dog.

00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,955

246
00:14:02,127 --> 00:14:03,492

00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:05,721

250
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:09,534
Do not take a dog for an appointment.

251
00:14:10,368 --> 00:14:11,232
Hey wait.

252
00:14:15,907 --> 00:14:16,999

Ok, it's a bit strange.

258
00:14:53,044 --> 00:14:53,840
I will continue.

259
00:14:58,617 --> 00:15:00,346
You know, if it were not upset.

260
00:15:00,385 --> 00:15:01,511
That would be really fun.

261
00:15:04,222 --> 00:15:05,120
There you are.

262
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,853

Rachel, help me.

266
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:21,604
Someone please.

267
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,301
I was abducted.

268
00:15:30,115 --> 00:15:30,843
Well ...

269
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:31,781
Good night.

270
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:32,714
Seriously.

271
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,453

What happens?

276
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:03,477
Chloe was lost.

277
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,987
I do not know where he was.

278
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:14,252
He does not always like to walk anywhere.

279
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:15,316
Less run.

280
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:16,991
Good.

281
00:16:19,597 --> 00:16:20,586
What?

282
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:25,696
Pelas of dogs.

283
00:16:26,237 --> 00:16:28,102
They are criminals, always do this.

284
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,164
How do you find them?

285
00:16:30,675 --> 00:16:31,664
I know something.

286
00:16:33,678 --> 00:16:34,838
Mexico City.

287
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:38,238
There is not much we can do.

288
00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:40,012
You did everything you could.

289
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,546
Why do not you wear your
dress and accompany us?

290
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:45,950
I will keep looking to Chloe.

291
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:48,989
And if I can not find
I'm going to Mexico City.

292
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:14,441
Where am I?

293
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:15,783
You are in dog fights.

294
00:17:16,454 --> 00:17:17,443
Dog fights.

295
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:21,084
This is bad.

296
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,187
I was born for purchases no fights.

297
00:17:24,229 --> 00:17:26,561
And unless I feel it breaking.

298
00:17:26,598 --> 00:17:27,929
Nice wine princess.

299
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,134
Chloe's clothes is not pink wine.

300
00:17:32,804 --> 00:17:34,704
A chihuahua disappointed.

301
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:37,230
You do not want to meddle with Miss thin.

302
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:38,572
It's a gladiator.

303
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,736
A gladiator?.

304
00:17:39,778 --> 00:17:42,076
You. He knows a fighter.

305
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,045
Delgado is the best of the best.

306
00:17:44,082 --> 00:17:45,879
No girl listen to Rafa.

307
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:49,115
The devil dominates the dog fights.

308
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:53,147
That was before he fell
that slender back.

309
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:00,294
What is he saying?

310
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:03,198
That dog always prays
before a fight.

311
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:05,099
Did not speak Spanish?

312
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:08,272
My name is Chloe, no girl.

313
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:10,297
And why would speak Spanish?

314
00:18:10,341 --> 00:18:12,366
Hey, you're a chihuahua friend.

315
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,378
Hello, I'm Beverly Hllls.

316
00:18:14,412 --> 00:18:17,438
Did you know that is the capital
of shopping in the world

317
00:18:17,482 --> 00:18:19,950
California is a gringo.

318
00:18:19,984 --> 00:18:22,077
That's right, and the only
why I'm here.

319
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,417
It's because I stole.

320
00:18:23,454 --> 00:18:25,115
Do you think I am a volunteer for this?

321
00:18:25,156 --> 00:18:26,919
But I am a pacifist.

322
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:27,982
¿Pacifica?

323
00:18:28,026 --> 00:18:30,620
No, pacifist.

324
00:18:30,662 --> 00:18:32,926
I believe in the fun.

325
00:18:32,964 --> 00:18:36,957
If you're worried about something, you stop,
if you stop, do not fight you.

326
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,638
So I guess that does not
There is nothing to worry about.

327
00:18:40,672 --> 00:18:43,903
That's a relief.

328
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:45,432
How nice that you feel better.

329
00:18:45,476 --> 00:18:47,171
Now you can stay a little quiet.

330
00:18:48,413 --> 00:18:51,177
I can not wait until that fight
and wait for Rachel to come.

331
00:19:03,328 --> 00:19:05,592
My senses are old.

332
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,068
Where is it? Where is my Chloe?

333
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:17,003
What's happening?

334
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:19,339
Hello.

335
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,572
I am a friend of Rachel.

336
00:19:27,285 --> 00:19:28,149
Are you the guardian?

337
00:19:28,653 --> 00:19:29,620
I am Sam.

338
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:31,679
Your garden is very nice.

339
00:19:32,657 --> 00:19:35,524
And when you have an
house, you call yourself ...

340
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,027
Thank you very much.

341
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:39,829
Where's Rachel?

342
00:19:39,864 --> 00:19:41,661
Forget about it buddy, Where's Chloe?

343
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:45,402
What are you hiding?

344
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:49,370
Chloe is lost through there
and Rachel are looking for.

345
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:51,466
The love of my life is
out problems.

346
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:53,841
Want to send this
to the city of Mexico.

347
00:19:53,878 --> 00:19:55,209
If.

348
00:20:26,444 --> 00:20:28,844
It was about time. I want recommendations.

349
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:31,839
And now the challenger.

350
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:36,343
It weighs as 6 pounds,
I huahua to Chichi.

351
00:20:45,296 --> 00:20:46,092
Thank you.

352
00:20:47,365 --> 00:20:48,195
Thank you.

353
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:49,991
They are very kind.

354
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,837
This is very nice looks like a parade.

355
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,942
Sorry, you had not seen.

356
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:03,810
They call me Diablo.

357
00:21:04,882 --> 00:21:06,474
Well, it's nice to meet you.

358
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:08,382
Sure I'm in the wrong place.

359
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:11,980
Maybe I can talk to
the counselor or someone.

360
00:21:12,023 --> 00:21:13,183
Stop talking.

361
00:21:14,192 --> 00:21:17,821
You know, I know a dentist in
Beverly Hills who can do something

362
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:18,793
In this regard.

363
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,762
What?

364
00:21:19,797 --> 00:21:21,526
Only I do not want you
drop a tooth in your work.

365
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:24,592
No, tell me anything.

366
00:21:25,336 --> 00:21:26,598
Hey quiet friend.

367
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:33,343
It sounds as if it were to come.

368
00:21:33,378 --> 00:21:34,640
The door.

369
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:36,647
It should not be much.

370
00:21:36,681 --> 00:21:38,615
Rage, rage.

371
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,214
She was going.

372
00:21:40,251 --> 00:21:41,309
Poor thing.

373
00:21:43,921 --> 00:21:45,047
Ok, that's all.

374
00:21:48,026 --> 00:21:48,924
What are you doing?

375
00:21:50,828 --> 00:21:52,090
Wait.

376
00:21:52,997 --> 00:21:53,725
What are you doing?

377
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:55,631
Hey brother, give me the conbinación.

378
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,463
We will not let Delgado.

379
00:21:57,502 --> 00:21:59,060
Return.

380
00:21:59,103 --> 00:22:01,298
This is very inappropriate.

381
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:03,864
Hey, that's an Cashman.

382
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:09,976
Adios.

383
00:22:14,352 --> 00:22:15,148
Dájame.

384
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,555
I know it is deficil leave,
but I gotta go now.

385
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:25,628
The show is all for you girl.

386
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:33,803
Not this time Diablo.

387
00:22:33,805 --> 00:22:34,601
Move, move.

388
00:22:35,573 --> 00:22:37,097
Delgado will find you.

389
00:22:41,312 --> 00:22:42,176
Wait for me.

390
00:22:55,093 --> 00:22:56,617
I love this chihuahua.

391
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:07,970
lnglés please.

392
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,376
Over here, over here.

393
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:24,584
My botita.

394
00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:25,785
Your what?

395
00:23:26,057 --> 00:23:26,785
My botita.

396
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:27,780
Forget about it.

397
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,689
That tell your mother, sir.

398
00:23:36,601 --> 00:23:42,005
Come on.

399
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:46,342
Hey Get off me.

400
00:23:46,377 --> 00:23:47,639
Do not understand.

401
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:48,667
I got it.

402
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:52,179
I hope you help me otherwise.

403
00:23:55,186 --> 00:23:56,915
I'm sure there are many more.

404
00:24:00,224 --> 00:24:01,020
Why?

405
00:24:07,265 --> 00:24:08,596
She llevava something.

406
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,929
Diamonds in his neck.

407
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:12,165
What?

408
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,366
Care.

409
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:20,136
What is this?

410
00:24:20,178 --> 00:24:21,907
Day of the Dead.

411
00:24:23,581 --> 00:24:27,574
It's so beautiful.

412
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:30,544
It is what humans do
to honor their ancestors.

413
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:34,282
Keep them alive in their hearts.

414
00:24:36,194 --> 00:24:38,128
To remember who they are.

415
00:24:38,162 --> 00:24:39,595
From which they come.

416
00:24:41,465 --> 00:24:42,397
You're my dog.

417
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:43,991
Thanks brother.

418
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,900
I see you, kid.

419
00:24:49,507 --> 00:24:50,303
Wait.

420
00:24:56,581 --> 00:24:57,377
See you.

421
00:24:57,882 --> 00:24:59,179
Wait, that's all.

422
00:24:59,217 --> 00:25:01,378
It is rule number 1
princess of the street.

423
00:25:01,452 --> 00:25:03,283
Each dog goes solo.

424
00:25:03,321 --> 00:25:04,982
Now, Get lost.

425
00:25:05,022 --> 00:25:07,889
My name is not a princess is Chloe.

426
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,893
And I'm lost.

427
00:25:12,263 --> 00:25:13,525
I want you to find me.

428
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:19,599
Look princess, I mean ...

429
00:25:19,637 --> 00:25:21,002
Look kid.

430
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:22,972
I have my own problems.

431
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:24,838
I can not go back to fighting.

432
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,433
I have to leave the city.

433
00:25:26,477 --> 00:25:28,775
How far is Beverly Hills?

434
00:25:28,813 --> 00:25:29,643
Very far.

435
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,704
Come on.

436
00:25:30,748 --> 00:25:32,943
If you can find out
the way back.

437
00:25:32,984 --> 00:25:34,747
You can live in soon in the state.

438
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:37,515
Where ever you do not
noticed I am a little big for that.

439
00:25:37,555 --> 00:25:39,955
But you have the perfect size
for a dog guardian.

440
00:25:39,991 --> 00:25:43,984
Of course, because Daddy, the fled.

441
00:25:44,161 --> 00:25:46,755
Did you have a watchdog
under the name Papi?

442
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:50,466
What I say.

443
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:51,468
So what will you do?

444
00:25:51,502 --> 00:25:53,595
Do not follow with questions
before I change my thinking.

445
00:25:53,638 --> 00:25:56,903
I do not know the name but
believe it is not a hotel.

446
00:25:57,775 --> 00:25:58,571
The Carfei.

447
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,108
There is one here.

448
00:26:00,144 --> 00:26:01,441
Did you know?

449
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:02,571
They should.

450
00:26:02,613 --> 00:26:03,944
We stayed.

451
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:06,074
We have a golden card.

452
00:26:06,117 --> 00:26:07,641
Why me?

453
00:26:07,685 --> 00:26:09,016
Of all the dogs in Mexico.

454
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:10,247
Why me?

455
00:26:10,288 --> 00:26:12,415
A Chihuahua with boots.

456
00:26:12,456 --> 00:26:13,946
It will be fun, and you'll see.

457
00:26:16,093 --> 00:26:17,651
Here is the GPS.

458
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:20,960
Lit.

459
00:26:22,366 --> 00:26:24,834
Diablo, go to the ride that chiuahua.

460
00:26:25,536 --> 00:26:26,696
Go, go.

461
00:26:48,826 --> 00:26:49,952
Wait a second.

462
00:26:51,829 --> 00:26:54,229
What's that sound?

463
00:26:54,265 --> 00:26:58,258
Mójate.

464
00:26:58,736 --> 00:27:00,727
Why did you do that?

465
00:27:00,771 --> 00:27:02,932
The devil is your flavor.

466
00:27:03,007 --> 00:27:06,966
Sure, it is chanel number 5.

467
00:27:07,011 --> 00:27:07,841
Congratulations.

468
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:11,075
Now I lost another boot and it stinks.

469
00:27:11,115 --> 00:27:11,945
I do not smell anything.

470
00:27:11,982 --> 00:27:13,006
Are you kidding?

471
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,381
I smell like a wet dog.

472
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:16,283
You are a wet dog.

473
00:27:20,324 --> 00:27:21,723
Look at Miss.

474
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,790
Ash.

475
00:27:25,363 --> 00:27:26,159
Sorry.

476
00:27:27,264 --> 00:27:29,459
We are trying to stop the fighting.

477
00:27:30,735 --> 00:27:34,671
And we do not have time to look for
Each dog lost in Mexico.

478
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:37,371
This is not just any dog.

479
00:27:37,408 --> 00:27:38,773
This is my dog vip.

480
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:40,777
Which means they try everything.

481
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:43,611
Let me tell you something.

482
00:27:44,882 --> 00:27:46,076
Go back to your hotel.

483
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:49,951
I'm going to hang a picture of me said.

484
00:27:49,987 --> 00:27:51,978
And I see I can do.

485
00:27:54,024 --> 00:27:54,615
Thank you.

486
00:27:54,658 --> 00:27:57,957
Your welcome.

487
00:28:00,965 --> 00:28:01,761
Hello.

488
00:28:04,802 --> 00:28:06,599
Yes, this is fantastic.

489
00:28:06,637 --> 00:28:08,400
You know it was you called,
and was concerned that

490
00:28:08,472 --> 00:28:10,440
No one was there.

491
00:28:11,242 --> 00:28:12,402
Yes, we left.

492
00:28:12,443 --> 00:28:14,138
For Mexicans.

493
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:16,640
Can I talk to her for a second?

494
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,148
Let me put it to the phone.

495
00:28:25,222 --> 00:28:26,314
How is my little baby?

496
00:28:30,561 --> 00:28:32,461
I miss you, miss you.

497
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:44,837
Ok.

498
00:28:46,177 --> 00:28:47,610
Here is your highness.

499
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:48,873
The hotel.

500
00:28:49,747 --> 00:28:51,237
I already feel like home.

501
00:28:54,185 --> 00:28:58,178
Delgado thank you, thank you, thank you.

502
00:28:58,956 --> 00:28:59,786
Do not worry.

503
00:28:59,824 --> 00:29:00,756
Adios.

504
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:02,656
Maybe you should wait out here.

505
00:29:03,594 --> 00:29:04,253
Whatever.

506
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:06,092
I do not want badly interpreted.

507
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:10,123
But individuals can be a little
by dogs that leave to enter.

508
00:29:10,201 --> 00:29:11,498
Okay.

509
00:29:11,535 --> 00:29:12,866
I'll stay here.

510
00:29:12,903 --> 00:29:15,770
Eat good food at a time.

511
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,943
Thank you.

512
00:29:25,783 --> 00:29:26,442
Sorry.

513
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,146
It would be kind enough to get my card.

514
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:31,620
You'll find my name
in the rear.

515
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:38,321
Hello?

516
00:29:39,763 --> 00:29:43,290
Her out of here!

517
00:29:44,702 --> 00:29:45,566
What?

518
00:29:45,603 --> 00:29:49,596
E always been to the veterinarian for years

519
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,140
Dares not!

520
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:57,612
This sorry -
a big mistake

521
00:29:57,648 --> 00:29:58,979
lnmenso

522
00:29:59,016 --> 00:30:01,416
What?

523
00:30:03,654 --> 00:30:05,554
Oh no

524
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:09,582
I'm ... dirty

525
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:14,590
Let us see that there are

526
00:30:36,687 --> 00:30:38,211
Figures

527
00:30:39,657 --> 00:30:41,386
What was going to wait?.

528
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:43,825
If you are a princess

529
00:30:52,836 --> 00:30:56,829
It was so humiliating not believe

530
00:31:00,644 --> 00:31:02,111
Relief?

531
00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:08,846
Relief?

532
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:23,082
I'm here to apologize
see the detective ramirez

533
00:32:25,396 --> 00:32:28,763
On this basis someone miss

534
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,198
Five minutes please

535
00:32:40,844 --> 00:32:44,007
Do not look now, Hanna
montana to 1 o'clock

536
00:32:45,349 --> 00:32:47,044
What are you doing here?

537
00:32:47,084 --> 00:32:50,417
I mean what are you doing here?

538
00:32:50,454 --> 00:32:53,150
It is not obvious? To find a clue

539
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,249
Angela your friend told me everything

540
00:32:55,592 --> 00:32:56,684
When you come back
speaking good English?

541
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:58,957
Not only did it to cover it

542
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:02,123
So let me go alone
and make me see how silly?

543
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:04,396
It needs no help for it

544
00:33:04,435 --> 00:33:06,562
What makes you believe that I need
Now aid of a gardener?

545
00:33:07,938 --> 00:33:09,371
Oh no, she does not

546
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:13,274
Not that I have a problem
with that word but

547
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,210
Actually I am a landscaper

548
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:17,475
And I'm not here for you

549
00:33:17,514 --> 00:33:20,483
I'm here for her viv
is like a family to me

550
00:33:25,489 --> 00:33:29,482
I sent an email with the description
the dog to all of our stations

551
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,687
Who described it? De-nothing

552
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:39,558
You see such a picture would be of more help

553
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:43,929
And what will we do now?

554
00:33:43,974 --> 00:33:44,963
Us?

555
00:33:45,008 --> 00:33:45,599
Nothing

556
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:48,009
You go back to your hotel and waiting

557
00:33:48,045 --> 00:33:49,444
Please

558
00:33:52,116 --> 00:33:54,812
Okay there is nothing
-What you can do?

559
00:33:54,852 --> 00:33:57,320
Must be able

560
00:33:57,354 --> 00:34:00,448
We can start looking for pasting photos

561
00:34:00,491 --> 00:34:02,152
I need your dog

562
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,225
I'm with her friend

563
00:34:04,261 --> 00:34:05,853
Clue is in trouble

564
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:09,731
Boby-fool Come, let us begin

565
00:34:09,767 --> 00:34:11,359
Boby where are you going?

566
00:34:24,281 --> 00:34:26,374
I can not believe that JamaiHeteiland
this will be lost

567
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:28,850
Smile

568
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:32,116
Thank you
- It will be on the cover of the magazine

569
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:37,293
This house is unbelievable

570
00:34:41,198 --> 00:34:42,460
That scuger

571
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:46,492
Come here FIESTERA-No.
Really no need

572
00:34:48,138 --> 00:34:49,833
Thank you

573
00:34:51,308 --> 00:34:54,471
JamaiHeteiland not believe they are not in trouble?

574
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:58,413
Oh please bet that
this in your favorite place

575
00:34:58,448 --> 00:35:02,441
I know this seated and secure
waiting for a hunki fuski

576
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,420
Thank you

577
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:17,494
I must be hungry

578
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:19,661
That is our churro

579
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:23,139
Our churro-sorry but ...

580
00:35:23,173 --> 00:35:24,697
I saw it first

581
00:35:24,741 --> 00:35:27,369
Better be careful boys

582
00:35:27,411 --> 00:35:31,074
Such as CHIHUAHUAS Luce warriors

583
00:35:31,114 --> 00:35:35,050
Now look, and lost
Suter of my favorite skin

584
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:39,278
And had to sleep
in a box and still there

585
00:35:39,323 --> 00:35:42,417
So do not push me!

586
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:45,826
Okay

587
00:35:45,863 --> 00:35:47,763
It's what I thought

588
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:51,299
It's time to read the paper

589
00:35:51,335 --> 00:35:53,929
A dog is kidnapped

590
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:55,233
Come pink

591
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:59,137
Do not be hero

592
00:35:59,176 --> 00:36:01,167
I can smell

593
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:26,501
Move Hurry up

594
00:36:26,536 --> 00:36:30,063
Above, the roof-I got scared

595
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:31,574
Come Hurry up

596
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:32,973

597
00:36:33,777 --> 00:36:35,745
Here no

598
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:39,271
Where are we going?

599
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:41,243
Oh not a trap

600
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:43,753
And that? I am thinking

601
00:36:54,998 --> 00:36:57,694
Why do I want?

602
00:36:57,734 --> 00:37:00,259
Had already bitten once

603
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:03,273
I love you let me leave

604
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:05,298
I saw you in the newspaper

605
00:37:05,342 --> 00:37:08,800
The most was that close to estube

606
00:37:17,554 --> 00:37:18,350
Vamonos

607
00:37:20,924 --> 00:37:22,721
Where are we going now?

608
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:25,922
There must be someone

609
00:37:25,963 --> 00:37:27,624
It's the only way out?.

610
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,433
Delgado? -What?

611
00:37:38,475 --> 00:37:41,205
Why do I pursue this?

612
00:37:41,244 --> 00:37:43,235
Vasquez should have sent

613
00:37:43,714 --> 00:37:45,807
Vasquez, who is?

614
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:49,410
They do whatever for money

615
00:37:49,453 --> 00:37:51,614
Plicía to the state for years after

616
00:37:51,655 --> 00:37:53,418
But always escapes

617
00:37:53,457 --> 00:37:55,186
How to know all that?

618
00:37:55,759 --> 00:37:58,284
You were a criminal or something?

619
00:37:58,328 --> 00:37:59,920
Or something

620
00:38:00,664 --> 00:38:01,824
Sleep something

621
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:04,732
It's a great journey and
Tomorrow is a big day

622
00:38:04,768 --> 00:38:07,737
What to say when he said he wanted
trying to make the hero?

623
00:38:13,143 --> 00:38:14,974
No matter

624
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:27,387
It is the shoe JamaiHeteiland

625
00:38:32,496 --> 00:38:34,054
What is it?

626
00:38:34,664 --> 00:38:35,722
The shoe JamaiHeteiland

627
00:38:35,799 --> 00:38:38,097
Good job! -You must be here

628
00:38:38,135 --> 00:38:39,727
I can feel

629
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,328
Wait for me!

630
00:38:45,008 --> 00:38:48,637
He says he saw a chihuhua

631
00:38:48,678 --> 00:38:50,509
Estubo here

632
00:38:50,547 --> 00:38:54,540
Having my JamaiHeteiland?

633
00:38:55,218 --> 00:38:57,778
I'm going to kick some tails

634
00:38:57,854 --> 00:38:59,048
Style boby

635
00:39:00,891 --> 00:39:04,054
If you? -Anyone else looking for that dog

636
00:39:05,729 --> 00:39:08,527
There are a lot of money in this chihuahua

637
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:09,862
Understand?

638
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,095
Can not find it before we did

639
00:39:12,135 --> 00:39:13,625
Well

640
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:20,937
Come on baby, come

641
00:39:21,678 --> 00:39:23,771

Ok, here is where we go out

643
00:39:40,597 --> 00:39:42,224
Stretch and go

644
00:39:48,038 --> 00:39:50,336
And what is your plan? This is the deal -

645
00:39:50,907 --> 00:39:54,900
You have to wait to return

646
00:39:55,345 --> 00:39:57,108
But where are you going?

647
00:39:57,714 --> 00:39:59,204
Delgado?

648
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:02,751
These strange know?

649
00:40:05,856 --> 00:40:09,257
I guess this is my source of water

650
00:40:24,374 --> 00:40:26,171
That is better

651
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:31,513
Alli remember this plan, no?

652
00:40:31,548 --> 00:40:33,846
Do not you have to eat seriously, no?

653
00:40:33,884 --> 00:40:35,476
Just swallow my legs

654
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:36,816
Ok here we go

655
00:40:36,853 --> 00:40:38,718

Are you okay?

666

Hello?

667
00:41:14,424 --> 00:41:16,051
You are an angel?

668
00:41:16,626 --> 00:41:17,786
I'm dead?

669
00:41:17,827 --> 00:41:20,387
No, and I am not an angel

670
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:23,658
Rescataste me as a hero

671
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,329
This is my true color

672
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,531
I am in heaven?

673
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:32,406
Something that's bebverly hills

674
00:41:32,442 --> 00:41:36,435
Ah bebverly hills
These little far from home

675
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:39,913
That look you can attend

00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,645
My name is Manuel

It's the least I can do

683
00:42:18,788 --> 00:42:19,311

684
00:42:19,356 --> 00:42:19,845

You really are you?

688
00:42:26,096 --> 00:42:27,791
What happened? Where have you been?

689
00:42:27,931 --> 00:42:30,832
No one has seen since
you know .. A time.

690
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:32,457
Look ...

691
00:42:32,669 --> 00:42:34,569
I am doing a job security.

692
00:42:34,904 --> 00:42:37,532
I'm taking a chihuahua
rich back Beberly Hiils.

693
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:39,069
Had been lost.

694
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:41,169
Take her to the assistance center then.

695
00:42:41,378 --> 00:42:42,743
So to find its owner.

696
00:42:42,879 --> 00:42:43,903
It is not so simple.

697
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,571
Other dogs are searching the
Informants are everywhere.

698
00:42:48,451 --> 00:42:50,146
Until the El Diablo are looking for.

699
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,151
Does the devil?

700
00:42:52,722 --> 00:42:53,746
Is that why you do it?

701
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:55,619
That offender is behind me.

702
00:42:55,759 --> 00:42:57,056
It's just u ntrabajo.

703
00:42:57,193 --> 00:42:58,990
Can you make the official
Mendez assist me in this?

704
00:42:59,129 --> 00:43:01,962
Sure, that's fine. I see it I can do.

705
00:43:07,203 --> 00:43:07,999
Walk.

706
00:43:08,605 --> 00:43:10,072
I saw someone who can help us.

707
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,236
Really?

708
00:43:11,474 --> 00:43:12,668
Me too.

709
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:13,639
Where is your collar?.

710
00:43:13,777 --> 00:43:15,768
You are not the only thing you can do things.

711
00:43:16,179 --> 00:43:16,975
What?

712
00:43:17,013 --> 00:43:18,412
I gave him my necklace to Manuel.

713
00:43:18,581 --> 00:43:20,606
And it will lead to the master.

714
00:43:21,217 --> 00:43:22,081
Manuel ¿?

715
00:43:22,218 --> 00:43:23,150
Who is Manuel?

716
00:43:23,286 --> 00:43:25,447
The cute little mouse who helped me.

717
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:28,351
What saved from being eaten by a lguana.

718
00:43:28,491 --> 00:43:29,549
¿Lguana?

719
00:43:29,726 --> 00:43:30,818
An iguana?

720
00:43:31,127 --> 00:43:32,594
That's the biggest lie!

721
00:43:32,896 --> 00:43:34,557
The lguanas are vegetarians!

722
00:43:34,664 --> 00:43:38,498
Sorry, I did not know
lguanas many in my life.

723
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:42,695
Without your collar identification, there is nothing
that keep you apart from any stray dog.

724
00:43:45,275 --> 00:43:48,870
She said that the boat would return soon.

725
00:43:49,279 --> 00:43:50,541
What boat?

726
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:52,079
That ship?

727
00:43:52,582 --> 00:43:54,709
What happened to the''no
talk to strangers''?

728
00:43:55,118 --> 00:43:56,642
Do not say anything iguanas.

729
00:43:57,253 --> 00:43:58,550
There my God ...

730
00:44:04,327 --> 00:44:05,316
What can I say?.

731
00:44:05,495 --> 00:44:06,860
You are an angel.

732
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:09,361
The skies were all believed ...

733
00:44:09,966 --> 00:44:12,161
It is the most TONTITA throughout Mexico.

734
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,338
Yet we can go to eat something.

735
00:44:15,538 --> 00:44:17,005
Where did you get that?

736
00:44:17,374 --> 00:44:20,343
Please do not eat me man ... I
wife and 300 kids to feed.

737
00:44:20,543 --> 00:44:21,635
Huyamos!

738
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:23,440
Where is the chihuahua.

739
00:44:23,613 --> 00:44:26,138
¿Chihuahua? Do not know
any chihuahua.

740
00:44:26,383 --> 00:44:27,611
Where did you get that?

741
00:44:27,951 --> 00:44:31,648
Of course, if you want to know one, could
arrelgar something for the right price.

742
00:44:31,821 --> 00:44:33,516
You are about to be eaten.

743
00:44:33,723 --> 00:44:34,951
That is the mood!

744
00:44:36,292 --> 00:44:37,384
Hurry up!

745
00:44:38,395 --> 00:44:41,330
're Straining my patience Chaparrita.

746
00:44:41,464 --> 00:44:42,829
Your patience is exhausted.

747
00:44:43,133 --> 00:44:43,929
Where is he?

748
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,568
By the source, close to the port.

749
00:44:46,669 --> 00:44:48,330
I did not know he was your friend.

750
00:44:48,505 --> 00:44:50,871
I told him just a cocitas.

751
00:44:51,107 --> 00:44:52,301
Please do not hurt me.

752
00:44:56,479 --> 00:44:58,572
See, that the Big One
Final us was afraid.

753
00:44:58,848 --> 00:45:01,874
You know, I do not think
We had fear.

754
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:03,850
Chico is not our problem.

755
00:45:04,754 --> 00:45:06,278
Come on, we can do is ..

756
00:45:08,191 --> 00:45:12,184
Oh, I guess ... when
say something like that ...

757
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,158
Delgado ..

758
00:45:18,334 --> 00:45:19,130
Yes?

759
00:45:19,302 --> 00:45:20,599
What do we do here?

760
00:45:21,538 --> 00:45:23,165
It's where we will meet with the Coyote.

761
00:45:23,406 --> 00:45:24,737
A coyote?

762
00:45:24,908 --> 00:45:26,068
A smuggler''''

763
00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:28,869
They help dogs as
us to cross the border.

764
00:45:32,182 --> 00:45:35,583
You used to be a police dog, right?

765
00:45:35,919 --> 00:45:37,819
It's like met Sergeant Thomas.

766
00:45:38,087 --> 00:45:40,146
That's why as you could do those things.

767
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:41,448
I do not want to talk about it.

768
00:45:41,591 --> 00:45:42,489
¿Quit?

769
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:43,924
Are you fired?

770
00:45:43,993 --> 00:45:45,517
Did you do something wrong?

771
00:45:45,762 --> 00:45:47,593
Yes, I did something wrong, OK?

772
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:49,195
Are you happy?

773
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,731
Forget it now.

774
00:45:52,068 --> 00:45:53,160
Okay.

775
00:45:53,636 --> 00:45:54,466
Well.

776
00:45:55,305 --> 00:45:56,135
Alli is.

777
00:45:57,073 --> 00:45:58,097
Come on now.

778
00:45:59,008 --> 00:45:59,940
And no more questions.

779
00:46:00,577 --> 00:46:01,475
Well.

780
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,541
What happened? ¿Hiriste someone?

781
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:06,614
Forget it!

782
00:46:06,683 --> 00:46:07,843
Just Forget it!

783
00:46:08,985 --> 00:46:10,452
I get mad.

784
00:46:10,553 --> 00:46:14,182
Well, you're not the
most charming traveling companion.

785
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:16,153
Well! That here we split.

786
00:46:16,426 --> 00:46:17,256
What?

787
00:46:18,094 --> 00:46:20,187
Wait .. What are you doing?

788
00:46:21,598 --> 00:46:22,963
This train will take you to Tijuana.

789
00:46:23,433 --> 00:46:24,229
But ..

790
00:46:24,267 --> 00:46:25,029
But nothing!

791
00:46:25,034 --> 00:46:26,797
The coyotes will take you to
the border from there.

792
00:46:29,038 --> 00:46:30,801
Get comfortable.

793
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:34,403
Good luck.

794
00:46:35,044 --> 00:46:36,011
But ...

795
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:37,907
I promised.

796
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,212
Do not walk away ..

797
00:47:04,307 --> 00:47:07,834
Do not turn ... not turn.

798
00:47:15,885 --> 00:47:17,079
Thin!

799
00:47:17,353 --> 00:47:18,479
Coming!

800
00:47:20,723 --> 00:47:22,384
Thin!

801
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:24,148
Chloe!

802
00:47:25,328 --> 00:47:26,158
Come on!

803
00:47:26,329 --> 00:47:27,125
Skip!

804
00:47:27,964 --> 00:47:28,896
If it were easy.

805
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:31,462
Come on! You can do it!

806
00:47:31,968 --> 00:47:32,764
Skip!

807
00:47:35,305 --> 00:47:36,101
Heavens!

808
00:47:36,606 --> 00:47:37,573
Come on!

809
00:47:38,107 --> 00:47:39,199
Could use some help.

810
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:40,374
I pull you.

811
00:47:45,014 --> 00:47:46,276
Thin!

812
00:47:54,624 --> 00:47:57,422
What can I say?. A
promise is a promise.

813
00:47:58,161 --> 00:48:00,254
So speaks thin.

814
00:48:08,605 --> 00:48:11,199
Lost .. Please .. A lost dog

815
00:48:16,279 --> 00:48:17,337
Chloe!

816
00:48:19,182 --> 00:48:20,080
Not that ...

817
00:48:22,418 --> 00:48:23,214
Daddy ...

818
00:48:24,253 --> 00:48:25,117
Daddy!

819
00:48:27,657 --> 00:48:28,453
You ...

820
00:48:28,491 --> 00:48:29,480
The vague.

821
00:48:29,692 --> 00:48:31,182
Where did you get that smell?.

822
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:35,058
Perhaps you have not noticed, but
This is a private rest area.

823
00:48:35,798 --> 00:48:37,857
You mean the scent taco?

824
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:39,161
Do not fool!

825
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:40,358
The perfume.

826
00:48:40,503 --> 00:48:41,629
It's Chloe.

827
00:48:41,804 --> 00:48:43,396
She is a Chihuahua U.S..

828
00:48:44,807 --> 00:48:48,174
Their ears are
punteagudas .. And his nose ...

829
00:48:48,678 --> 00:48:50,407
It is like a blackberry.

830
00:48:50,647 --> 00:48:51,773
Really?

831
00:48:52,615 --> 00:48:53,445
A arrears?

832
00:48:55,118 --> 00:48:59,111
She is careful with the clothes?

833
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:01,547
You know .. Where is he?

834
00:49:01,724 --> 00:49:04,989
The last time I saw her,
Delgado was running with.

835
00:49:05,128 --> 00:49:05,924
If.

836
00:49:06,496 --> 00:49:07,394
Delgado ¿?

837
00:49:07,764 --> 00:49:08,822
Who is this thin?

838
00:49:10,299 --> 00:49:11,493
I want to hear more.

839
00:49:11,734 --> 00:49:12,723
Come with me.

840
00:49:15,204 --> 00:49:17,035
It seems that got a couple of friends.

841
00:49:17,273 --> 00:49:18,501
Just what we needed.

842
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:20,141
Stray dogs.

843
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:22,768
Daddy was a stray dog.

844
00:49:24,147 --> 00:49:25,944
What kick there.

845
00:49:26,849 --> 00:49:28,077
Hello friend.

846
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:31,550
The inspires me every day.

847
00:49:32,355 --> 00:49:34,516
What inspires you to you Rachel?

848
00:49:35,591 --> 00:49:36,922
Then we talk about that.

849
00:49:38,394 --> 00:49:39,486
Hello.

850
00:49:39,696 --> 00:49:40,788
Look at that.

851
00:49:41,364 --> 00:49:42,592
How are you?

852
00:49:43,032 --> 00:49:43,828
Hello!

853
00:49:44,867 --> 00:49:46,061
If it is nice.

854
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:50,039
They can go with us, but you will have
to give them a bath, that stinks.

855
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:51,431
I can handle that.

856
00:49:52,008 --> 00:49:52,838
You stink.

857
00:49:54,544 --> 00:49:55,340
Bad guy.

858
00:49:55,845 --> 00:49:57,870
Boy, I love this.

859
00:49:58,414 --> 00:50:00,382
I think I fell in love with this gringo.

860
00:50:04,387 --> 00:50:05,376
I think he likes.

861
00:50:06,322 --> 00:50:07,550
I think your looking for you.

862
00:50:09,258 --> 00:50:10,225
No no!

863
00:50:10,526 --> 00:50:11,652
Wait!

864
00:50:23,873 --> 00:50:26,899
Look'm clean,
did not know who felt.

865
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:28,302
Now if.

866
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:30,772
I had never brushed their teeth.

867
00:50:31,814 --> 00:50:33,179
And it's mint!

868
00:50:33,983 --> 00:50:35,075
It is rare ...

869
00:50:35,351 --> 00:50:36,875
Daddy, this is great.

870
00:50:37,186 --> 00:50:38,676
We must call room service.

871
00:50:38,821 --> 00:50:39,913
Or rent a movie.

872
00:50:41,124 --> 00:50:42,682
Have we found a home, Daddy?

873
00:50:42,992 --> 00:50:44,050
I do not know.

874
00:50:44,193 --> 00:50:46,184
But for now are safe.

875
00:50:46,829 --> 00:50:48,262
Sam did it for me.

876
00:50:51,234 --> 00:50:52,223
See you tomorrow.

877
00:50:52,368 --> 00:50:53,164
We're going guys.

878
00:50:53,236 --> 00:50:54,396
No, you can stay with me

879
00:50:55,872 --> 00:50:57,032
I do not think that is the problem.

880
00:50:57,707 --> 00:50:58,605
Well.

881
00:50:58,908 --> 00:51:00,842
Daddy! What you see, mate?

882
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:03,103
It is a big place my friend.

883
00:51:03,412 --> 00:51:07,405
And I will be small. But looking
something bigger than everything.

884
00:51:12,054 --> 00:51:13,521
My heart ...

885
00:51:36,712 --> 00:51:39,306
Sorry. Where are you?

886
00:51:39,549 --> 00:51:41,073
I'm from Beverly Hills.

887
00:51:41,417 --> 00:51:42,645
Where is that?

888
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:47,421
Well, it feels like a long way from here.

889
00:51:48,424 --> 00:51:49,584
Miss ..

890
00:51:50,092 --> 00:51:51,423
What is that?

891
00:51:51,761 --> 00:51:52,819
It is a boot ..

892
00:51:53,196 --> 00:51:54,458
Poredi the others.

893
00:51:54,664 --> 00:51:56,894
All the dogs in Beberly
Hills have to use them.

894
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,535
It must be very dirty there.

895
00:52:00,102 --> 00:52:04,095
No, in fact, is the place
More clean it.

896
00:52:05,174 --> 00:52:07,836
It is very foolish to use a botita then ..

897
00:52:07,944 --> 00:52:09,878
Pedro ... do not be poorly educated.

898
00:52:11,147 --> 00:52:13,138
Pedro know something ...

899
00:52:15,284 --> 00:52:16,649
You're right.

900
00:52:52,722 --> 00:52:53,620
Rachel.

901
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:55,486
Rachel.

902
00:52:55,625 --> 00:52:57,354
Let Sleeping Beauty, go!

903
00:52:58,127 --> 00:52:59,424
Detective Ramirez called it.

904
00:52:59,695 --> 00:53:02,892
A white Chihuahua and a German shepherd,
were seen in Puerto Vallarta.

905
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:06,191
They were not sure if it was,
that was not using his collar.

906
00:53:06,335 --> 00:53:07,131
What?

907
00:53:07,169 --> 00:53:08,659
Someone stole the necklace to Chloe?

908
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:10,897
I will show them who I am!

909
00:53:15,344 --> 00:53:17,369
I was sore stomach ..

910
00:53:17,813 --> 00:53:19,007
Insurance was the enchilada.

911
00:53:19,482 --> 00:53:23,475
I thought about the dog .. No
we should have stolen her necklace,

912
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,317
Now never home ...

913
00:53:31,994 --> 00:53:32,961
Get out of here.

914
00:53:54,383 --> 00:53:55,975
Saquemonos this, you do not
we know where we go ..

915
00:53:57,253 --> 00:53:58,185
I feel naked ...

916
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,525
For alla!

917
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:08,688
Come back!

918
00:54:12,034 --> 00:54:13,001
Jump from me!

919
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:18,028
Care!

920
00:54:27,049 --> 00:54:28,277
To learn that.

921
00:54:37,526 --> 00:54:38,550
You have my diamonds!

922
00:54:38,794 --> 00:54:39,818
Let him!

923
00:54:55,945 --> 00:54:57,207
Quick, come!

924
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:58,478
To hide!

925
00:54:58,581 --> 00:54:59,513
Quick, Hide.

926
00:55:04,253 --> 00:55:05,117
What's happening?

927
00:55:05,654 --> 00:55:07,315
Delgado, what is going on?

928
00:55:07,523 --> 00:55:08,547
We are in trouble.

929
00:55:09,291 --> 00:55:11,282
Hide, the distract.
- Okay.

930
00:55:11,394 --> 00:55:13,225
Do not leave no matter what happens.

931
00:55:14,163 --> 00:55:14,857
Delgado ..

932
00:55:14,864 --> 00:55:16,559
Do not leave no matter what happens.

933
00:55:16,966 --> 00:55:17,955
What are you gonna do?.

934
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,328
Something silly.

935
00:55:25,141 --> 00:55:26,267
Beware of dog!

936
00:55:43,159 --> 00:55:44,387
It was not so difficult.

937
00:55:47,563 --> 00:55:48,587
There is God.

938
00:55:49,098 --> 00:55:50,190
Go my luck ..

939
00:55:50,433 --> 00:55:51,991
Thin!

940
00:55:53,469 --> 00:55:54,367
My God ..

941
00:55:54,703 --> 00:55:55,499
My lucky dog ..

942
00:55:55,504 --> 00:55:56,835
Did you see that?

943
00:55:56,972 --> 00:55:59,167
I just jump from the train.

944
00:55:59,742 --> 00:56:00,800
I alone.

945
00:56:01,143 --> 00:56:02,235
And I was in motion.

946
00:56:03,212 --> 00:56:05,442
I told you to stay there.

947
00:56:06,315 --> 00:56:09,079
We are in this together.
I could not leave here.

948
00:56:10,853 --> 00:56:12,844
Never had a friend like you.

949
00:56:14,356 --> 00:56:17,450
You should have been
girl. Look around ...

950
00:56:18,294 --> 00:56:19,818
You should have been.

951
00:56:23,999 --> 00:56:26,900
I told the police that
I found the necklace on the floor.

952
00:56:26,936 --> 00:56:28,267
But I do not believe.

953
00:56:28,571 --> 00:56:31,768
I went to deliver the diamonds,
and tratron of arrest.

954
00:56:32,007 --> 00:56:34,066
I regret the confusion sir.

955
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:35,502
The rat ..

956
00:56:35,711 --> 00:56:37,076
... is smart.

957
00:56:37,279 --> 00:56:38,769
Oe .. Such needs help.

958
00:56:38,948 --> 00:56:42,008
I tried to give him, but
always escabuyia.

959
00:56:42,685 --> 00:56:44,676
Habil ... habil mouse.

960
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,012
He knows he needs ...

961
00:56:47,423 --> 00:56:48,549
A dog.

962
00:56:48,924 --> 00:56:49,948
But it is street.

963
00:56:50,126 --> 00:56:51,354
If it is ..

964
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,127
But it is a very good dog.

965
00:57:01,971 --> 00:57:03,199
Thanks for returning the necklace ...

966
00:57:03,405 --> 00:57:04,463
Congratulations.

967
00:57:05,207 --> 00:57:06,435
Ya got home.

968
00:57:08,077 --> 00:57:09,476
Also you go.

969
00:57:09,645 --> 00:57:10,873
I know my friend.

970
00:57:11,046 --> 00:57:13,207
Come on, everything will go your time.

971
00:57:15,851 --> 00:57:17,284
Don 't get on the furniture.

972
00:57:17,553 --> 00:57:18,850
Good luck finding your dog.

973
00:57:18,921 --> 00:57:19,785
Thank you.

974
00:57:21,257 --> 00:57:23,589
I have just spoken to the
Police in Puerto Vallarta.

975
00:57:23,792 --> 00:57:27,250
They say that there was a problem with a
dog on the train to north this morning.

976
00:57:27,663 --> 00:57:29,062
It was with a German shepherd.

977
00:57:30,699 --> 00:57:31,563
That's it.

978
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,596
Thank you.

979
00:57:34,036 --> 00:57:35,230
Call me if you learn something.

980
00:57:35,571 --> 00:57:36,731
Finding headed north ...

981
00:57:40,142 --> 00:57:42,167
Bone they were
with my diamond ..

982
00:57:42,444 --> 00:57:46,073
I think it's Karma ... or something like that.

983
00:57:46,315 --> 00:57:49,682
If you steal, eventually
you stole.

984
00:57:49,985 --> 00:57:51,509
That does not matter to me.

985
00:57:52,054 --> 00:57:53,043
What are you going ahacer then?

986
00:57:53,255 --> 00:57:54,119
Silence.

987
00:58:12,775 --> 00:58:16,768
So Britany says that will come with
Scooter .. I know that it is bone, half crazy.

988
00:58:18,914 --> 00:58:20,245
Please God ... that street.

989
00:58:20,416 --> 00:58:22,816
But do not say ..
I have to support it, no?

990
00:58:24,086 --> 00:58:27,146
Wait a second ... What is no longer
This tree had happened before?

991
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:28,788
No.

992
00:58:29,024 --> 00:58:29,956
Wrong.

993
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:31,319
We walked for hours.

994
00:58:31,493 --> 00:58:33,757
But I sense something ..

995
00:58:33,862 --> 00:58:35,056
¿President?

996
00:58:36,932 --> 00:58:38,263
Do you notes?

997
00:58:41,537 --> 00:58:44,301
Oh God ... you can not smell ..

998
00:58:45,107 --> 00:58:46,404
Right?

999
00:58:49,278 --> 00:58:50,176
No.

1000
00:58:50,346 --> 00:58:51,540
What happened?

1001
00:58:51,847 --> 00:58:53,906
Okay, you can tell me.

1002
00:58:55,117 --> 00:58:57,745
That is why the police.

1003
00:58:58,153 --> 00:59:01,919
I let go ... and that
I could not follow a trail.

1004
00:59:03,692 --> 00:59:05,489
And now here we are,
walking in circles.

1005
00:59:06,929 --> 00:59:08,055
Sorry girl.

1006
00:59:09,765 --> 00:59:10,595
What was that?

1007
00:59:10,766 --> 00:59:11,926
Pumas.

1008
00:59:12,501 --> 00:59:13,729
I'm afraid slim.

1009
00:59:13,969 --> 00:59:15,061
I know.

1010
00:59:15,738 --> 00:59:17,000
Well, we better move.

1011
00:59:17,206 --> 00:59:18,195
We have to get out of here.

1012
00:59:18,574 --> 00:59:19,233
Well ..

1013
00:59:19,241 --> 00:59:20,139
Come on. Do not talk.

1014
00:59:33,122 --> 00:59:33,952
Thin.

1015
00:59:34,123 --> 00:59:35,522
What happened to you?

1016
00:59:36,191 --> 00:59:38,022
Why can not smell anything?

1017
00:59:43,365 --> 00:59:44,764
Well ...

1018
00:59:46,835 --> 00:59:48,302
My partner and I ...

1019
00:59:49,672 --> 00:59:52,573
We were on a raid.

1020
00:59:52,708 --> 00:59:54,141
I was ahead.

1021
00:59:54,777 --> 00:59:56,540
Before I knew,
left me without a conscience ..

1022
00:59:57,813 --> 00:59:59,007
It was all very fast.

1023
01:00:03,652 --> 01:00:07,349
While she was unconscious,
my companion was wounded.

1024
01:00:10,326 --> 01:00:11,987
Never came into being
the same after that.

1025
01:00:13,595 --> 01:00:15,358
Neither I nor.

1026
01:00:19,101 --> 01:00:21,228
Debi have meaning come.

1027
01:00:22,137 --> 01:00:24,367
I lifted the following day
and could not smell anything.

1028
01:00:24,807 --> 01:00:25,865
Are you injured?

1029
01:00:26,141 --> 01:00:27,165
Not ..

1030
01:00:27,376 --> 01:00:28,843
They say it's all in my head.

1031
01:00:30,145 --> 01:00:31,407
In my head.

1032
01:00:32,348 --> 01:00:33,144
We found

1033
01:00:33,615 --> 01:00:36,379
The stop as much as you can
while run, understand?

1034
01:00:36,652 --> 01:00:38,813
They are just cats, you can do. --

1035
01:00:41,223 --> 01:00:42,155
I need a miracle.

1036
01:00:42,624 --> 01:00:43,921
Care!
- Run if you say so.

1037
01:00:44,426 --> 01:00:45,393
You can!

1038
01:00:46,328 --> 01:00:47,454
You can do it!

1039
01:00:49,365 --> 01:00:50,354
Do not be afraid.

1040
01:00:52,668 --> 01:00:53,657
Have them!

1041
01:00:57,373 --> 01:00:58,305
Chloe runs!

1042
01:00:59,908 --> 01:01:00,875
Run and hide!

1043
01:01:01,043 --> 01:01:01,668
Here ...

1044
01:01:01,677 --> 01:01:02,803
Aca no!

1045
01:01:28,437 --> 01:01:30,428
Say hello to my little friends.

1046
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:39,407
Good time you guys came.

1047
01:01:39,581 --> 01:01:41,048
I am Moctezuma.

1048
01:01:41,216 --> 01:01:42,774
Come with us if they want to live.

1049
01:01:43,152 --> 01:01:44,585
Yes, I want to live.

1050
01:01:46,054 --> 01:01:47,351
I have seen it all.

1051
01:01:52,661 --> 01:01:55,494
Can you help us return
Moctezuma to civilization?

1052
01:01:55,798 --> 01:01:56,730
Clear.

1053
01:01:56,899 --> 01:02:00,699
But it is very dangerous to walk these
by obscure places where this.

1054
01:02:00,836 --> 01:02:03,100
Spend the night here with us.

1055
01:02:03,539 --> 01:02:04,904
Where are we?

1056
01:02:05,307 --> 01:02:06,638
They are in Chihuaha.

1057
01:02:07,042 --> 01:02:09,567
The birthplace
Our powerful race.

1058
01:02:09,912 --> 01:02:11,743
I was born in Beberly Hills.

1059
01:02:12,548 --> 01:02:16,416
You see, all your
ancestors come from here.

1060
01:02:17,586 --> 01:02:21,579
Some took to the civilization ..
But we stand.

1061
01:02:40,576 --> 01:02:42,305
Did you hear what he said, Delgado?

1062
01:02:42,878 --> 01:02:44,709
I come from a powerful race.

1063
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,447
If, powerfully annoying.

1064
01:02:46,748 --> 01:02:49,945
You're upset that we
Small dogs saved.

1065
01:02:50,219 --> 01:02:51,345
Very small dogs.

1066
01:02:53,689 --> 01:02:56,089
Tonight we will celebrate his arrival.

1067
01:02:57,459 --> 01:02:58,926
Thanks Moctezuma.

1068
01:02:59,194 --> 01:03:00,684
Please ...

1069
01:03:00,829 --> 01:03:01,887
Dime Mocty.

1070
01:03:03,699 --> 01:03:04,666
Anyway ...

1071
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:13,532
All this for my Mocty?

1072
01:03:13,842 --> 01:03:15,935
If, for you.

1073
01:03:16,044 --> 01:03:18,911
When he returns to a chihuahua
home is cause for celebration.

1074
01:03:19,515 --> 01:03:21,506
Even a Chihuaha of Beberly Hills?

1075
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:22,946
Clear.

1076
01:03:23,318 --> 01:03:26,583
No matter where you come,
're one of us.

1077
01:03:27,089 --> 01:03:29,853
Small but powerful.

1078
01:03:30,025 --> 01:03:31,049
¿Almighty?

1079
01:03:31,493 --> 01:03:33,859
But I'm just a puppy.

1080
01:03:34,496 --> 01:03:35,520
¿Dog?

1081
01:03:35,731 --> 01:03:36,663
No.

1082
01:03:36,865 --> 01:03:38,423
Do not insult you.

1083
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,895
Do not insult the Chihuahua race.

1084
01:03:41,203 --> 01:03:42,135
No more ..

1085
01:03:42,604 --> 01:03:43,730
Is it not more?

1086
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,401
It means, no more.

1087
01:03:47,976 --> 01:03:51,969
We are not CHIHUAHUAS
toys or fashion accessories.

1088
01:03:52,681 --> 01:03:53,648
No more!

1089
01:03:53,849 --> 01:03:57,842
Not born to use hats
Fools and handbags use.

1090
01:03:59,788 --> 01:04:03,519
We were not known with
derogatory names.

1091
01:04:03,659 --> 01:04:07,652
We have been told Juguetitos, and
pequeñuelos for long.

1092
01:04:07,863 --> 01:04:08,989
No more!

1093
01:04:09,164 --> 01:04:13,157
Names like fifi, fufu,
Puki, Pumpkin, trespass against us.

1094
01:04:15,037 --> 01:04:15,935
No more!

1095
01:04:16,004 --> 01:04:19,997
Yes, the small but we chihuahas
not for dicersion of humans.

1096
01:04:20,943 --> 01:04:24,936
What we know that the
power of our inner strength.

1097
01:04:26,281 --> 01:04:27,339
No more!

1098
01:04:27,516 --> 01:04:31,509
Yes, we are small,
but we are powerful!

1099
01:04:31,887 --> 01:04:32,683
No more!

1100
01:04:33,055 --> 01:04:34,022
No more!

1101
01:04:35,791 --> 01:04:39,056
Join us Chloe. Join this''no more''

1102
01:04:39,328 --> 01:04:40,955
Find your bark.

1103
01:04:41,129 --> 01:04:42,562
My bark?

1104
01:04:43,131 --> 01:04:46,430
Yes, what makes you powerful.

1105
01:04:46,768 --> 01:04:48,326
What makes you .. Your.

1106
01:04:50,138 --> 01:04:51,969
We are Chihuahuas.

1107
01:04:52,708 --> 01:04:54,039
Oyannos barking!

1108
01:05:03,285 --> 01:05:04,309
That was embarrassing.

1109
01:05:04,686 --> 01:05:08,679
Do not worry little, your bark
come when you need it really.

1110
01:05:41,256 --> 01:05:42,883
The last happens is a cat ..

1111
01:05:47,162 --> 01:05:48,993
Come on, open!

1112
01:05:51,299 --> 01:05:52,698
The sweet smell of success.

1113
01:05:53,035 --> 01:05:54,093
I smell something else.

1114
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:56,037
Where is the suitcase?

1115
01:05:56,138 --> 01:05:57,662
Where is the suitcase
that is my diamond

1116
01:05:57,773 --> 01:05:58,967
Be careful with your nose.

1117
01:05:59,741 --> 01:06:02,073
I do not feel good doing this.

1118
01:06:02,177 --> 01:06:04,645
I do not feel good ..

1119
01:06:05,614 --> 01:06:06,945
Now for that.

1120
01:06:07,549 --> 01:06:09,176
The iguanas are supposed
who have the blood cold.

1121
01:06:09,384 --> 01:06:11,545
Well, you know who was born in captivity.

1122
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,551
Born under the light of a lamp.

1123
01:06:13,689 --> 01:06:15,554
And parallel. We have a job to do.

1124
01:06:16,658 --> 01:06:18,990
So you were the
rata to the collar theft.

1125
01:06:19,261 --> 01:06:20,558
See, you got.

1126
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:23,960
Hey, you have me confused with another rat.

1127
01:06:24,566 --> 01:06:25,897
We are here.

1128
01:06:26,134 --> 01:06:27,226
No, it is.

1129
01:06:27,402 --> 01:06:28,232
He did.

1130
01:06:28,503 --> 01:06:30,903
And now the love of my life
alli is in trouble.

1131
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:31,971
Not for us.

1132
01:06:32,641 --> 01:06:34,199
Just trying to save her.

1133
01:06:34,476 --> 01:06:34,999
If.

1134
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:36,705
Dog pursuing hellish that.

1135
01:06:37,446 --> 01:06:39,243
Tell me about this diabolical dog.

1136
01:07:07,409 --> 01:07:08,706
Chloe.

1137
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:10,971
You can stay if you want.

1138
01:07:11,913 --> 01:07:14,177
This place is awesome Mocty.

1139
01:07:14,783 --> 01:07:18,776
But there is someone in this house that
time is concerned and surprised me.

1140
01:07:20,055 --> 01:07:21,579
And I miss it.

1141
01:07:21,823 --> 01:07:23,415
Does your heart?

1142
01:07:23,792 --> 01:07:24,952
My heart?

1143
01:07:25,761 --> 01:07:27,160
What does that mean?

1144
01:07:27,562 --> 01:07:29,496
The love of your heart.

1145
01:07:30,198 --> 01:07:32,826
Nor even gave it a chance.

1146
01:07:33,001 --> 01:07:36,402
We come CHIHUAHUAS
in many shapes and colors.

1147
01:07:36,638 --> 01:07:40,631
But when a view, not with your eyes, but
with your soul, there we are all equal.

1148
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:45,637
Listen ..

1149
01:07:46,414 --> 01:07:47,881
That the pumas ...

1150
01:07:51,253 --> 01:07:52,117
Thank you.

1151
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:55,756
But of course, we are Chihuahua.

1152
01:07:59,294 --> 01:08:01,421
Civilization at last.

1153
01:08:01,863 --> 01:08:03,194
We accomplished Delgado.

1154
01:08:03,765 --> 01:08:04,697
Thin!

1155
01:08:04,866 --> 01:08:06,163
Let's see who wins.

1156
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:09,798
That was great.

1157
01:08:10,138 --> 01:08:11,901
Yeah, sure, it was.

1158
01:08:12,674 --> 01:08:13,936
Delgado, look.

1159
01:08:14,409 --> 01:08:15,205
What?

1160
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:16,406
Are you?

1161
01:08:16,912 --> 01:08:17,810
Bonita toga.

1162
01:08:18,013 --> 01:08:21,107
I can not believe that
Rachel is looking for me.

1163
01:08:21,449 --> 01:08:22,575
Well, we go for help.

1164
01:08:49,244 --> 01:08:52,736
I always wanted one of these.
Is that they are very intelligent.

1165
01:08:54,816 --> 01:08:56,443
He would make a great company.

1166
01:08:57,219 --> 01:08:59,119
I think they are right for each other.

1167
01:08:59,588 --> 01:09:01,488
Someone got a girlfriend.

1168
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:03,321
I have a home.

1169
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:05,189
I understand.

1170
01:09:05,727 --> 01:09:06,523
Rachel!

1171
01:09:06,595 --> 01:09:08,187
Ramirez was found to Chloe.

1172
01:09:18,907 --> 01:09:20,306
How about that?

1173
01:09:21,676 --> 01:09:22,768
We must go.

1174
01:09:23,345 --> 01:09:26,007
Ramirez is waiting for us.
I told you the match.

1175
01:09:42,063 --> 01:09:43,052
This is the place.

1176
01:09:47,369 --> 01:09:48,199
Chloe!

1177
01:09:51,773 --> 01:09:52,603
Hello!

1178
01:09:54,476 --> 01:09:55,408
Hello!

1179
01:09:56,244 --> 01:09:57,506
How about here?

1180
01:09:58,179 --> 01:09:59,612
U.S. dog ...

1181
01:10:02,784 --> 01:10:04,081
Well here we go ..

1182
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:05,816
What?

1183
01:10:08,256 --> 01:10:09,689
Excuse me Miss.

1184
01:10:10,292 --> 01:10:11,520
Please, go ahead.

1185
01:10:16,965 --> 01:10:18,865
I have seen this before gringo.

1186
01:10:22,971 --> 01:10:24,063
That van.

1187
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:25,433
My Chloe has been there.

1188
01:10:25,573 --> 01:10:26,699
Perrot very well.

1189
01:10:26,841 --> 01:10:27,830
You're the daddy.

1190
01:10:28,009 --> 01:10:28,907
Now go for it.

1191
01:10:29,077 --> 01:10:30,271
Get your princess.

1192
01:10:30,445 --> 01:10:31,469
My heart ...

1193
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:37,242
Deshariamos that we never thought of it.

1194
01:10:37,552 --> 01:10:38,712
Come on, apurale.

1195
01:10:38,954 --> 01:10:40,615
Now porphine may be because of my diamonds.

1196
01:10:40,755 --> 01:10:42,222
Rapido, or return.

1197
01:10:57,038 --> 01:10:57,868
Oh no ...

1198
01:11:06,715 --> 01:11:07,511
What?

1199
01:11:07,549 --> 01:11:08,277
What do you say?

1200
01:11:08,283 --> 01:11:09,079
Chloe!

1201
01:11:12,854 --> 01:11:13,912
We have to get it!

1202
01:11:20,395 --> 01:11:21,885
Chloe! Where are you?

1203
01:11:22,163 --> 01:11:23,391
I'm going!

1204
01:11:25,867 --> 01:11:27,664
Where to get me?

1205
01:11:46,955 --> 01:11:48,388
Diablo good job.

1206
01:11:48,523 --> 01:11:49,455
Good job.

1207
01:11:53,328 --> 01:11:56,320
I've given a lot problems,
I hope it is worth.

1208
01:11:57,032 --> 01:11:59,159
Let's call the owners for the reward.

1209
01:11:59,534 --> 01:12:00,558
Yes, sir.

1210
01:12:07,542 --> 01:12:08,338
Surprise!

1211
01:12:11,179 --> 01:12:12,908
Sueltameee!

1212
01:12:15,717 --> 01:12:17,878
Daddy, what are you doing here?

1213
01:12:18,019 --> 01:12:18,986
Salvandote!

1214
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:19,916
Run!

1215
01:12:21,556 --> 01:12:22,523
Come over here.

1216
01:12:24,526 --> 01:12:25,322
Go!

1217
01:12:28,363 --> 01:12:29,523
Catch these chihuahua!

1218
01:12:29,697 --> 01:12:31,028
That does not escape.

1219
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:32,689
Daddy .. So now what?

1220
01:12:33,101 --> 01:12:34,466
I will protect my heart.

1221
01:12:40,975 --> 01:12:41,771
Not Chloe.

1222
01:12:51,586 --> 01:12:52,712
My head ..

1223
01:12:52,921 --> 01:12:54,047
I need an aspirin.

1224
01:12:54,189 --> 01:12:55,053
That hurt.

1225
01:12:55,190 --> 01:12:56,088
Do you support?

1226
01:12:56,224 --> 01:12:57,122
You 2.

1227
01:12:57,292 --> 01:12:58,088
What do you do here?

1228
01:12:58,226 --> 01:12:59,090
It is not what you think man.

1229
01:12:59,661 --> 01:13:02,323
Do not try to steal this necklace.

1230
01:13:02,897 --> 01:13:03,693
Of course ..

1231
01:13:03,731 --> 01:13:04,527
Maybe if ..

1232
01:13:04,732 --> 01:13:08,133
What comes to my partner
say is that if such a hurry,

1233
01:13:08,303 --> 01:13:09,930
You can continue using their tracking this.

1234
01:13:11,139 --> 01:13:11,935
I can not.

1235
01:13:12,073 --> 01:13:12,869
What?

1236
01:13:12,941 --> 01:13:15,273
Not even gonna try it?.

1237
01:13:16,177 --> 01:13:18,577
What is the point of
to be a German shepherd?

1238
01:13:20,482 --> 01:13:21,278
I can not.

1239
01:13:21,416 --> 01:13:23,043
She needs you.

1240
01:13:23,184 --> 01:13:24,617
I can not smell, do you not understand?

1241
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,482
She needs you.

1242
01:13:26,688 --> 01:13:27,746
Then do it.

1243
01:13:27,956 --> 01:13:28,888
It smells.

1244
01:13:31,726 --> 01:13:32,454
That's it.

1245
01:13:32,594 --> 01:13:34,323
You can do it, go!

1246
01:13:37,632 --> 01:13:38,656
I feel something ...

1247
01:13:39,901 --> 01:13:40,959
Rat ...

1248
01:13:41,936 --> 01:13:43,733
Nachos old ...

1249
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,603
Chanel No. 5.

1250
01:13:48,376 --> 01:13:49,206
It's got!

1251
01:13:50,612 --> 01:13:51,772
I have a Chiuhuahua to save!

1252
01:13:54,415 --> 01:13:55,507
Don 't wear the necklace.

1253
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:56,776
What got.

1254
01:13:56,918 --> 01:13:58,180
You did something good.

1255
01:13:58,586 --> 01:13:59,883
You know you did something good.

1256
01:14:00,855 --> 01:14:02,789
Do not follow ...
- Te blushing ..

1257
01:14:04,092 --> 01:14:06,253
It could have gone anywhere.

1258
01:14:08,329 --> 01:14:09,455
Chloe is the necklace.

1259
01:14:10,365 --> 01:14:12,196
He wants us to the chihuahua.

1260
01:14:12,834 --> 01:14:13,630
Come on, come on.

1261
01:14:23,244 --> 01:14:24,268
Care.

1262
01:14:24,412 --> 01:14:26,243
The structure is fragile.

1263
01:14:33,454 --> 01:14:36,252
There is no sign of the dog here

1264
01:14:36,291 --> 01:14:39,522
You're lucky to be here

1265
01:14:41,596 --> 01:14:43,063
Lights confused

1266
01:14:43,765 --> 01:14:44,857
Where are you going?

1267
01:14:44,899 --> 01:14:46,833
Looking for the rest of your tail?

1268
01:14:50,772 --> 01:14:53,536
It was here that these girl

1269
01:14:53,575 --> 01:14:55,475

01:15:12,126 --> 01:15:14,424
Hola a less

What's going on?

1274
01:15:18,566 --> 01:15:19,658
What is it?

1275
01:15:19,701 --> 01:15:21,498
Cloe all right?

1276
01:15:25,073 --> 01:15:27,735
You are very brave JamaiHeteiland

1277
01:15:27,775 --> 01:15:28,833
Get out of here

1278
01:15:30,278 --> 01:15:31,711
Run!

1279
01:15:31,746 --> 01:15:33,407
Vamonos

1280
01:15:34,148 --> 01:15:36,639
Come Catch Me

1281
01:15:36,684 --> 01:15:38,208
Sorry I have to go

1282
01:15:46,327 --> 01:15:47,521
Best careful dog

1283
01:15:47,562 --> 01:15:49,689
Or end up as a piñata

1284
01:15:49,731 --> 01:15:51,722
Do not call me for anything fast

1285
01:15:53,301 --> 01:15:54,359
Come

1286
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:57,062
Popy

1287
01:15:57,138 --> 01:15:59,663
Say goodbye to your heart

1288
01:15:59,707 --> 01:16:03,006
No

1289
01:16:03,645 --> 01:16:06,113
No more

1290
01:16:06,147 --> 01:16:07,876
Finish

1291
01:16:07,949 --> 01:16:09,644
No more

1292
01:16:14,088 --> 01:16:15,419
That is my bark

1293
01:16:26,601 --> 01:16:28,159
Ladra

1294
01:16:30,338 --> 01:16:31,737
Ladra

1295
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:39,442
It's all yours official

1296
01:16:41,015 --> 01:16:44,041
Mr. Vasquez-see that?

1297
01:16:44,085 --> 01:16:45,950
Ladra

1298
01:16:46,921 --> 01:16:49,321
I saw

1299
01:16:51,059 --> 01:16:53,550
It is time to finish what I started

1300
01:16:53,594 --> 01:16:55,459
I no longer scare

1301
01:16:55,496 --> 01:16:57,555
So why is shaky?

1302
01:16:57,632 --> 01:16:59,623
Because I am a chihuahua

1303
01:17:03,004 --> 01:17:04,596
Grave error

1304
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:06,197
Let him in peace

1305
01:17:07,141 --> 01:17:08,631
Cloe you doing?

1306
01:17:08,676 --> 01:17:11,975
This mouunstro took my sweater

1307
01:17:13,648 --> 01:17:15,081
Care

1308
01:17:20,321 --> 01:17:22,721
That ended!

1309
01:17:22,757 --> 01:17:24,850
I was stripped of everything!

1310
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:28,190
Now we are equal

1311
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:30,060
Cloe

1312
01:17:38,306 --> 01:17:39,637
Girl?

1313
01:17:40,241 --> 01:17:42,209
She is ...

1314
01:17:42,243 --> 01:17:43,574
Dead

1315
01:17:47,882 --> 01:17:49,179

1316
01:17:49,784 --> 01:17:51,115

01:17:51,753 --> 01:17:54,051
Talk to me

1318
01:17:54,088 --> 01:17:57,683
Feel my ears with your beautiful voice

1319
01:17:58,393 --> 01:18:02,386
Without you the sun does not shine

1320
01:18:03,064 --> 01:18:05,965
The flowers do not beauty

1321
01:18:06,534 --> 01:18:10,527
Cloe, there is no way
returns to Beverly Hills

1322
01:18:13,441 --> 01:18:16,604
And always take care of your garden

1323
01:18:16,644 --> 01:18:20,637
Your love is rain
that falls in my yard

1324
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:25,981
Not even begins to like

1325
01:18:27,488 --> 01:18:30,457
Popy that was beautiful

1326
01:18:30,491 --> 01:18:33,824
Again

1327
01:18:33,861 --> 01:18:35,954
She came back!

1328
01:18:37,899 --> 01:18:39,594
Are you okay?

1329
01:18:40,268 --> 01:18:43,897
Cloe estubiste where?

1330
01:18:43,938 --> 01:18:47,669
Rachel you missed all the fun

1331
01:18:50,878 --> 01:18:53,142
You are a rude chihuahua

1332
01:18:53,181 --> 01:18:55,411
Small but dangerous

1333
01:19:00,721 --> 01:19:02,120
Hello

1334
01:19:20,908 --> 01:19:24,503
So you're the dog gardener

1335
01:19:24,579 --> 01:19:27,571
No, I am a paisajero

1336
01:19:28,282 --> 01:19:29,806

1338
01:19:31,385 --> 01:19:33,319
Well, goodbye small

1339
01:19:34,188 --> 01:19:35,587
Delagdo

1340
01:19:35,623 --> 01:19:39,616
That look you can take
as a security dog

1341
01:19:40,161 --> 01:19:44,154
Thanks for the offer but
someone has to go after the devil

1342
01:19:44,365 --> 01:19:48,358
I think apart princess

1343
01:19:49,637 --> 01:19:51,298

But his is not the goodbye, I am
sure that we will again

1346
01:20:05,686 --> 01:20:09,554
Do not turn

1347
01:20:11,158 --> 01:20:14,093
Such a look can use an extra pair

1348
01:20:16,797 --> 01:20:19,163
Where is believed that official?

1349
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,471
Accept the job?

1350
01:20:36,517 --> 01:20:37,381
Official

1351
01:20:43,658 --> 01:20:45,091
Well done

1352
01:20:51,766 --> 01:20:53,631
Cloe, Popy go home

1353

1362
01:21:31,105 --> 01:21:32,094

Welcome

1366
01:21:47,688 --> 01:21:49,315
What a surprise!

1367
01:21:50,191 --> 01:21:53,649
I took pictures of the most beautiful gardens

1368
01:21:53,694 --> 01:21:56,356
Do not believe where is my JamaiHeteiland?

1369
01:21:56,397 --> 01:22:00,390
Actually I need it ...
- It is better to know what to say?.

1370
01:22:00,635 --> 01:22:01,795
