1
00:00:00,345 --> 00:00:01,779
Previously on The Fosters...

2
00:00:02,113 --> 00:00:03,616
You need to make a bold move.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,504
You put your underwear in my pocket.

4
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,611
I was, you know, flirting.

5
00:00:07,646 --> 00:00:08,879
So what you're just
like a tease, is that it?

6
00:00:08,914 --> 00:00:11,549
- No, I...
- Thanks for wasting my time.

7
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:13,634
I see you've met Hurricane Dani.

8
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:15,786
- You have a girlfriend?
- She's more like a sober buddy.

9
00:00:15,821 --> 00:00:16,987
I love you.

10
00:00:17,022 --> 00:00:20,825
If I have to wait a while, so
I'm gonna be with you again...

11
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:23,690
Well, that's what I'm gonna do.

12
00:00:23,696 --> 00:00:27,898
I never realized until today
that for us to be together,

13
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:30,701
you have to give up everything.

14
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:33,504
Do you want to make some fast
bank? Why don't we sell some IDs?

15
00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:34,563
Isn't that like a felony?

16
00:00:34,564 --> 00:00:37,290
Your mom's a school veep.
You have access to her keys.

17
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:39,643
We have access to the
idea maker at Anchor Beach.

18
00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:45,616
Ugh! I hate being late to school.

19
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,834
Then stop hogging the bathroom.

20
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:49,503
- Callie took longer than me.
- Yeah, that happened.

21
00:00:49,538 --> 00:00:52,957
And in other news, the laws of space
and time no longer apply in the bathroom.

22
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,595
I don't care who's to blame.

23
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:58,763
From now on, the car leaves at 7:30.

24
00:00:58,797 --> 00:01:01,498
Whoever's not in it can walk to school.

25
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:02,600
I'm always ready.

26
00:01:02,634 --> 00:01:03,667
I know, honey, that's
why you're my favorite.

27
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:06,554
- Hey!
- Go!

28
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:10,921
Um, so was wondering would I be
able to go to Daphne's after school?

29
00:01:10,926 --> 00:01:13,627
Michelle at Girls United is taking Kiara

30
00:01:13,662 --> 00:01:16,597
and said she could pick
me up and bring me home.

31
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:20,534
I don't think we're that
comfortable having you

32
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:22,837
go to someone's apartment unsupervised.

33
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:24,672
- What if they come to our house?
- Ok.

34
00:01:24,706 --> 00:01:27,691
I can see if they can come to me then.

35
00:01:36,952 --> 00:01:38,786
- Hi.
- Hey.

36
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:46,460
Just one more day until weigh-in,
Foster. Do you have what it takes?

37
00:01:46,494 --> 00:01:49,547
Can you resist pastry perfection?

38
00:01:49,598 --> 00:01:51,766
You're gonna have to try a different trick.

39
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,769
Or some better food.
I mean, scones, really?

40
00:01:54,803 --> 00:01:56,720
Yeah, really.

41
00:01:56,772 --> 00:01:59,690
And it's a family
recipe, have some respect.

42
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:01,859
Eat away. Ice runs through these veins.

43
00:02:01,893 --> 00:02:04,779
- Ok, Ice Man. Hmm? Hmm?
- What are you...

44
00:02:04,813 --> 00:02:09,617
- Really? Really!
- Yep, yep.

45
00:02:13,688 --> 00:02:15,539
You have a girlfriend, you know?

46
00:02:15,574 --> 00:02:17,792
Thank you, Captain Obvious.
Emma's just a friend.

47
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:19,827
That better be all she is.

48
00:02:30,755 --> 00:02:33,808
Thank you, again, so much for letting
Callie come back to Anchor Beach.

49
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:36,477
I know the last thing you
need is more paperwork.

50
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:38,646
Well, actually, I wanted
to talk to you about that.

51
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,848
I need to fill out a progress
report for Callie's P.O.

52
00:02:40,882 --> 00:02:43,651
She has been here every single day.

53
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:45,586
He's looking for more than just attendance,

54
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,689
and to be honest, I am, too.
She needs to participate.

55
00:02:48,723 --> 00:02:53,561
A club, sports, student
government, anything.

56
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:56,564
Callie needs to show that she wants
to be a part of this community.

57
00:02:56,598 --> 00:02:59,466
I understand that, and we have spoken to
her about getting more involved in school.

58
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:02,536
But not every kid is a joiner.

59
00:03:02,571 --> 00:03:04,738
And not every kid is a runaway, either.

60
00:03:04,773 --> 00:03:07,842
Look, I know you and Stef have
your hands full with five teenagers.

61
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:09,576
We are managing.

62
00:03:09,594 --> 00:03:12,479
Mariana and Jesus have both
been suspended this year,

63
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:14,748
and Jude barely passed
his proficiency test.

64
00:03:14,783 --> 00:03:19,553
- Brandon is the only one...
- That what, isn't a normal teenager?

65
00:03:19,588 --> 00:03:22,756
Everyone's kids make mistakes, Karina.

66
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,893
Are mine supposed to be held to a
higher standard because I work here?

67
00:03:25,927 --> 00:03:27,761
Lena, that's not what I'm saying.

68
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:30,831
- What are you saying?
- I want Callie to succeed here.

69
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:32,733
I really do.

70
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:35,703
And the more roots that she puts down,

71
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:37,905
the harder they are to pull up,

72
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:40,507
and the easier my paperwork gets.

73
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:43,477
Oh. I forgot about the fire drill.

74
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:55,839
I know the school's not really on fire,

75
00:03:55,891 --> 00:03:57,925
but the drill doesn't
work unless we pretend.

76
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,761
Of course, Vice Principal. Going.

77
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,964
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

78
00:04:49,694 --> 00:04:51,678
Hey. Did you get in? Did it work?

79
00:04:51,696 --> 00:04:53,897
We got a problem. Oh,
hell. We got two problems.

80
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:55,899
A cop. Be cool.

81
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:58,869
- Hey, B, how are you?
- Hey, Mom.

82
00:04:58,903 --> 00:05:01,388
What are you doing here?

83
00:05:01,423 --> 00:05:03,690
I'm having lunch with Mama. Hi.

84
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,859
Uh... this is Vico.

85
00:05:05,877 --> 00:05:07,711
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

86
00:05:07,746 --> 00:05:09,413
Nice to meet you.

87
00:05:09,464 --> 00:05:11,632
Uh... class.

88
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,668
- New friend?
- Nah, not really.

89
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:16,804
- How are you? I miss you.
- I'm good.

90
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:19,390
Come to have dinner with
us tomorrow at the house?

91
00:05:19,424 --> 00:05:22,843
I can't, actually. I have a
"getting to know you" thing with Dad

92
00:05:22,877 --> 00:05:25,712
- and his girlfriend, so...
- Your dad has a girlfriend?

93
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,433
- That's nice. How long has that been going on?
- I don't know.

94
00:05:29,484 --> 00:05:31,685
It must be serious if he's
asking you to meet her, right?

95
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:35,406
Well, we met before. We just haven't...

96
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,691
Oh, I see. She's been by the apartment.

97
00:05:37,726 --> 00:05:39,727
- Is she spending the night there?
- Mom, I don't...

98
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:41,528
No, no, B, listen.

99
00:05:41,563 --> 00:05:42,796
You're living with your dad,

100
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:44,765
and I just want to make sure

101
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:47,801
that it's a healthy environment.

102
00:05:47,836 --> 00:05:49,569
- I'm not gonna get in the middle of this.
- Ok.

103
00:05:49,587 --> 00:05:52,573
So if you wanna know about
dad's girlfriend, ask him.

104
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:54,875
- Will do. How old is she?
- Ok.

105
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:57,428
- Mom.
- What, is she 30? At least?

106
00:05:57,462 --> 00:05:59,763
- Come on. Love you.
- I love you.

107
00:06:01,516 --> 00:06:02,649
You know, it just...

108
00:06:02,684 --> 00:06:04,651
it's hard enough with Brandon
not living under our roof.

109
00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:09,423
His father has got girls going in and out,

110
00:06:09,457 --> 00:06:12,459
- and coming and going.
- One girl. One girl.

111
00:06:12,494 --> 00:06:15,396
- Remember the pet psychic?
- Oh, God. She was young.

112
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,865
Yeah, she said that our cat used
to be Cleopatra in a former life.

113
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:20,667
- Remember that?
- I forgot about that.

114
00:06:20,702 --> 00:06:22,770
Mmm, here's one.

115
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:25,406
"African-American, six foot,

116
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,574
Masters in poetry. Loves dogs."

117
00:06:27,609 --> 00:06:29,743
You know, if she's gonna be
spending the night at the apartment,

118
00:06:29,777 --> 00:06:32,463
exactly what kind of an example
is that setting for Brandon?

119
00:06:32,497 --> 00:06:33,614
We should definitely meet her.

120
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:35,449
African-American?

121
00:06:35,483 --> 00:06:37,618
Well...

122
00:06:37,652 --> 00:06:39,686
- Yeah...
- No, I just...

123
00:06:39,721 --> 00:06:42,790
You know, if we're... can't
have the baby together,

124
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:45,459
just that maybe I thought
we could find a donor

125
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:48,829
that has more of my characteristics.

126
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:52,833
- You mean white?
- And smart and loyal and charming

127
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:54,802
and sweet and loving and caring.

128
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:58,439
See, the thing is that I'm half white

129
00:06:58,473 --> 00:06:59,740
so if we go with a donor who's also white,

130
00:06:59,774 --> 00:07:02,709
then the baby might not end
up looking like me at all.

131
00:07:02,744 --> 00:07:05,379
No, no, no, I get it. I get it. I get it.

132
00:07:05,413 --> 00:07:07,581
It's just it's going to be our baby.

133
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:10,451
And that's fine. That's all that matters.

134
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:11,618
It doesn't have to look like me

135
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:13,587
so African-American it is. Totally.

136
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:14,838
Let's do this.

137
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:25,382
Hey, friend.

138
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:26,800
Hey, pal.

139
00:07:28,853 --> 00:07:31,505
So do we...

140
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:32,706
should we eat lunch together?

141
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,675
I don't know.

142
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:36,543
That kind of seems like
advanced-level friendship.

143
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:42,549
- Well, it was a good effort.
- Yeah, baby steps.

144
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:45,719
Boom.

145
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:50,624
I can't believe Kelsey got
the friends in our break-up.

146
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:53,627
It's 'cause they're scared of her, right?

147
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:55,462
Yeah. I don't blame them She's scary.

148
00:07:55,497 --> 00:07:58,699
Meanwhile, Zac's acting like I set his
lighting plans on fire or something,

149
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:01,668
which is lame. He's the one
who left me at the cast party.

150
00:08:01,703 --> 00:08:04,638
Yeah, he left because he
thought you two were on a date.

151
00:08:04,672 --> 00:08:08,375
No, we're just... you came with us.

152
00:08:08,393 --> 00:08:10,477
Yeah, he wasn't too happy about that.

153
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:14,748
- Oh, no.
- What?

154
00:08:14,782 --> 00:08:18,569
Zac was there, when Chase
went upstairs, after I...

155
00:08:19,721 --> 00:08:22,589
After I put my underwear in Chase's pocket.

156
00:08:22,624 --> 00:08:25,609
Wait! You did what?

157
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,726
I don't wanna talk about it.

158
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:29,413
Look, and the whole time, I was on a date,

159
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:31,565
- with Zac.
- Yeah.

160
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,732
A pretty bad one.

161
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:41,758
Hey. What happened? Did you get caught?

162
00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:43,594
No, there was an alarm.

163
00:08:43,628 --> 00:08:45,746
It wasn't on today, but
it will be after hours.

164
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,432
So we're screwed?

165
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:50,884
Unless you can get the code.

166
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,819
Sure. I'll ask my mom.

167
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:54,655
She's gotta have it written
down somewhere, right?

168
00:08:57,725 --> 00:09:00,594
It's worth it, dude. The
machine works like a charm.

169
00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:04,565
Ok. I'll see what I can do.

170
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:05,897
You got huevos, Foster.

171
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:08,035
With a cop and a vice principal for a mom.

172
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,476
It's only a one-time thing.

173
00:09:09,477 --> 00:09:11,462
Once I get the money I need, I'm out.

174
00:09:11,673 --> 00:09:14,408
Totally. But first things first.

175
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:15,709
We're putting that bad boy to the test.

176
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:18,679
We're hitting the bars tonight.

177
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:27,387
Zac.

178
00:09:27,422 --> 00:09:29,556
I have a newspaper meeting, like now, so...

179
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:33,594
I'm sorry. For the
misunderstanding at the cast party.

180
00:09:33,628 --> 00:09:35,829
I didn't know that you thought
we were together together.

181
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:37,764
I didn't think that.

182
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:40,467
- You didn't?
- No.

183
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:43,804
We worked on the play together,
we went to the party as friends.

184
00:09:43,838 --> 00:09:45,856
Oh. Good. Ok.

185
00:09:45,907 --> 00:09:47,874
So we're ok?

186
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:50,677
No.

187
00:09:50,712 --> 00:09:53,614
You don't ditch a friend to go
hook-up with some no-talent toolbox.

188
00:09:53,648 --> 00:09:56,617
- Ok, I did not hook up with Chase.
- Whatever, Mariana,

189
00:09:56,651 --> 00:09:58,852
don't worry about it. The play's
over. We don't need to be friends.

190
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,268
- You told people?
- What are you talking about?

191
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:23,121
The pant... the panties.

192
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:24,172
What? No.

193
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,041
Is this because I didn't hook up with you?

194
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:29,010
Look, it wasn't me. You
must have told someone.

195
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,247
Or somebody saw you. You
weren't exactly stealth about it.

196
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:36,051
No, you're lying. You know
how I know you're lying?

197
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:38,086
Because you're a terrible actor.

198
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,976
Hey! Come in.

199
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:46,261
Hi.

200
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:49,865
Dang! Look at you.

201
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,199
She cleans up good, doesn't she?

202
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,235
My P.O. makes me wear this for interviews.

203
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:56,104
- Feel like I'm in a Halloween costume.
- So how'd it go?

204
00:10:56,138 --> 00:10:58,173
We'll see.

205
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:00,876
Well, thanks for coming to me.

206
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,979
I can only be here or at school, so...

207
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:05,280
It's kind of like I
never left Girls United.

208
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:08,884
Ain't nothing about this
place like Girls United.

209
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,051
You ran away from here?

210
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,187
Um, you guys want some food?

211
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:14,289
I can, like, make us
sandwiches or something.

212
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:17,859
Just glad I'm not eating ramen.

213
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:20,228
So how is independent living?

214
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,265
It's a challenge. They don't
pay enough to cover my bills.

215
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:25,300
No one's trying to hire a kid out of juvie,

216
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:28,036
no matter how many recommendation
letters Rita or Michelle write.

217
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,005
And they won't give you
Tasha back without a job?

218
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:33,108
I get a supervised
visit with her next week.

219
00:11:33,142 --> 00:11:36,978
Yeah. I want to buy her this tricycle,
like the one I had when I was kid.

220
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,047
So she won't forget me while
I'm trying to get her back.

221
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:41,950
That's why I need a job.

222
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:43,168
So what's up with you?

223
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,837
Um, you know.

224
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,289
No, we don't know.

225
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:51,927
It's all good. I'm supposed
to be making friends

226
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,328
and joining clubs, I guess.

227
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:55,330
I don't really have anything in common

228
00:11:55,364 --> 00:11:57,332
with the kids I go to school with, so...

229
00:11:57,366 --> 00:12:01,169
You didn't have much in common with
us, either, but we're all friends.

230
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:04,072
- And Brandon?
- Not an issue.

231
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:07,175
- He moved in with his dad.
- Not an issue?

232
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:11,246
He's everywhere you look,
and you're in school with him.

233
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,015
Yeah, no, Brandon and me, we're good.

234
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,886
Well, Kiara has some good news.

235
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,921
Mmm, mmm, mmm...

236
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:22,924
- I got me a foster family.
- What?

237
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,877
Yeah. All because of you.

238
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:29,197
That picture you took of me in photography
class, they used it on the website.

239
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:31,866
Um,  it's just a picture.

240
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:33,969
No, your pictures are different.

241
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,004
They're more real.

242
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:39,874
Your picture brought out
all of my inner beauty.

243
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,980
The pictures CPS takes of us makes
us all look like dogs at the pound.

244
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,149
Well, hello, ladies.

245
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,919
- Hi, Mrs. Foster.
- Hi.

246
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:52,904
Go ahead and call me Stef, all right?

247
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:56,157
Glad that you guys could come
and visit. That's wonderful.

248
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,275
You want anything else?

249
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:59,227
No, thanks.

250
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:03,198
Well, if you change your mind,
just help yourself, right?

251
00:13:03,232 --> 00:13:05,066
Michelle's gonna pick us up at any moment.

252
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:08,954
So we should probably wait for her. Thanks.

253
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:11,806
Yeah, I'm gonna walk you out
so I can say hi to Michelle.

254
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:14,209
Thanks, Mrs... Stef.

255
00:13:14,276 --> 00:13:16,211
You're welcome. Bye.

256
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,899
What'd I tell you, man?
These things are golden.

257
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:40,118
Fine, we got past the doors, but
what if someone else figures us out?

258
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,871
- We could get arrested.
- No one is getting arrested.

259
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,907
I'll have a Rusty Nail.

260
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:49,044
Yeah, I'll have a Cosmopolitan?

261
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,981
- Well or shelf?
- What do you recommend?

262
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:56,251
- Top shelf.
- You know what is gonna get us busted?

263
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:58,319
You standing there looking
all uptight and guilty.

264
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:00,188
Hell, I'm about to arrest you.

265
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:02,190
Our IDs kick ass.

266
00:14:02,224 --> 00:14:05,160
Enjoy this moment.

267
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:07,929
- Yeah, you're right.
- Good.

268
00:14:07,963 --> 00:14:11,900
So why did you need the money so fast?

269
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,035
Long story.

270
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,871
Bars were invented for long stories.

271
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,913
Nice. It's like drinking
with my little sister.

272
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:33,922
- $12?
- Top shelf, bro.

273
00:14:35,324 --> 00:14:39,894
So I meant to tell you about the
conversation I had with Karina today

274
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:43,098
about how we have our hands
full with all these kids.

275
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,265
Yeah, well, we do.

276
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,052
Her tone was more critical than concerned.

277
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:48,903
They have been getting into some trouble.

278
00:14:48,938 --> 00:14:50,939
What else did she have to say?

279
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,008
She has to do Callie's
progress reports for her P.O.

280
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:55,844
and she really thinks that Callie should be

281
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:57,212
getting more engaged in school.

282
00:14:57,246 --> 00:14:59,948
Ok, should we be concerned
she's spending so much time

283
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,884
- with Daphne and Kiara?
- Why, 'cause they're juvenile delinquents?

284
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:04,819
Well, because she's not
making friends at Anchor Beach.

285
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:07,055
- But now that you mention it.
- They're good girls.

286
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:10,859
Yeah, at heart, but they do have
a history of drugs and gangs.

287
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:13,094
The rate of recidivism
with girls like them...

288
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:15,930
Callie is a girl like them.

289
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,887
- Hey.
- Need some help?

290
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,205
I think we're good, thanks.

291
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,175
Um, I took a picture of Kiara
while I was at Girls United

292
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:31,146
and I guess it helped
her find a foster family.

293
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,014
That's wonderful.

294
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:35,183
Yeah, so I was thinking

295
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:39,104
maybe I could do that for other
kids that need foster homes.

296
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:42,257
Take pictures, I mean.
So I can talk to my P.O.,

297
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,293
and see if it would count towards
my community service hours.

298
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:50,098
And maybe I could use
the photo lab at school?

299
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:52,033
Great. I think that can be arranged.

300
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,171
Yeah, maybe you can ask some of
your classmates for some help.

301
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,306
Or make some new friends.

302
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,909
I was actually

303
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:03,945
gonna have Daphne and Kiara help me out,

304
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:06,981
- just for their hours, too.
- Ok, that makes sense.

305
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:10,852
But Principal Sanchez would really like
to see you getting more involved in school.

306
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,121
Yeah, and we would, too.

307
00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:16,257
I will try.

308
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,062
Well, she wants to do it at school.

309
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:24,265
- That's a step in the right direction, right?
- Yeah.

310
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,937
All right, let me guess.

311
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:34,943
Huge gambling debt. And if
you don't get the money ASAP,

312
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:36,211
a bookie's gonna come break your legs.

313
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:41,082
Or you're a male prostitute
on the run from your pimp.

314
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,087
You caught me.

315
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:50,024
No, I owe it to my dad, actually.

316
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:54,996
He was giving it to me for my
piano lessons, and I quit going.

317
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,231
So you just pocketed it?

318
00:16:56,265 --> 00:17:00,835
Well, I was saving it for Callie.

319
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,805
So you're willing to
break bad for the girl.

320
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,908
You must be in love.

321
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:11,079
You know what? Forget I told you.

322
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,118
So what, she took the money
and ran off with Wyatt?

323
00:17:17,152 --> 00:17:18,920
No.

324
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:22,957
I used it for something else.

325
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:26,928
And now I have to pay my
dad back before he finds out.

326
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:30,865
He's just been going through
a lot of stuff lately.

327
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,836
And I just don't want to
stress him out anymore.

328
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,905
You're a good man, Charlie Brown.

329
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:38,172
You're an ass.

330
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:40,174
Is that any way to talk to your wingman?

331
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:48,283
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting you laid, bro.

332
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,853
Best thing for a broken heart. Let's go.

333
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,865
- I gotta go.
- Don't be a wuss.

334
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:05,967
No, I gotta go.

335
00:18:20,336 --> 00:18:22,337
I missed breakfast?

336
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:23,371
You had to work.

337
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:29,076
All right, when I go back to my
regular schedule, it's me, you

338
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:32,297
and pancakes every
morning, just like Mom's.

339
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:37,302
Or you know, cereal. But together.

340
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:41,022
Uh, so you know that
dinner with Dani tonight?

341
00:18:41,056 --> 00:18:45,226
It's been moved... yeah, to Mom's house.

342
00:18:45,294 --> 00:18:48,129
Apparently, someone told
her I had a girlfriend.

343
00:18:48,164 --> 00:18:51,232
Oh. Right, I'm sorry.

344
00:18:54,036 --> 00:18:56,037
So, um...

345
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:58,173
how long has Dani been sober?

346
00:18:58,207 --> 00:19:00,341
Five years. Why?

347
00:19:00,376 --> 00:19:03,211
Are you...

348
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:06,014
I mean,

349
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:09,017
do you worry about
dating another alcoholic?

350
00:19:10,152 --> 00:19:13,221
I mean, like, if she were
to start drinking again,

351
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:16,124
would that maybe make you wanna...

352
00:19:16,158 --> 00:19:19,126
Brandon, I appreciate the concern.

353
00:19:19,144 --> 00:19:21,996
But she's a rock, ok?

354
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:26,134
Look, I know I've given you
reason to worry in the past,

355
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:29,971
but my sobriety is not
tied into anyone else's.

356
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:33,041
Ok?

357
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,225
Ok.

358
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,128
I'm in a good place.

359
00:19:38,497 --> 00:19:40,098
All right.

360
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:45,303
Oh, I called your piano teacher.

361
00:19:45,337 --> 00:19:47,138
- When?
- Last week.

362
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:50,141
And when he calls me back, I'm
gonna tell him to save you a spot.

363
00:19:50,175 --> 00:19:52,243
The spot's long gone.
He has a waiting list.

364
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:55,313
So I sweet-talked him once,
who's to say I can't do it again?

365
00:19:55,347 --> 00:19:58,149
I just don't want to take from him, ok?

366
00:19:58,183 --> 00:20:01,219
I'm still playing piano, so...

367
00:20:01,253 --> 00:20:03,154
He was kind of a pompous ass anyway.

368
00:20:03,188 --> 00:20:08,259
So just don't call him again.

369
00:20:10,496 --> 00:20:12,430
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

370
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:18,169
- Ok.
- All right.

371
00:20:27,296 --> 00:20:29,547
How is it possible you
got scrawnier, Foster?

372
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:34,102
- You get dumber every day, so...
- Torched!

373
00:20:34,136 --> 00:20:35,553
Jesus, you're up.

374
00:20:42,194 --> 00:20:46,097
Oh, down a class. Looks like someone's
getting himself off the bench.

375
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:49,100
Never doubted it for a moment.

376
00:20:49,118 --> 00:20:51,402
- Thanks for your support.
- Emma, you're up.

377
00:20:57,509 --> 00:21:00,378
Whoa, would you look at
that? I take it back, Foster.

378
00:21:00,412 --> 00:21:02,480
Emma gained. Now you're in the same class.

379
00:21:02,514 --> 00:21:05,316
Looks like we're gonna have
a wrestle-off this afternoon.

380
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:07,468
Torched!

381
00:21:10,288 --> 00:21:12,306
Vico, step up to the plate.

382
00:21:14,093 --> 00:21:17,128
I was just on my way
to see you with a gift.

383
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:20,398
Actually, more of a bribe, truth be told.

384
00:21:20,432 --> 00:21:25,236
Ok, what exactly are you hoping to get in
exchange for this delectable baked good?

385
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,072
I was wondering if it's possible
that I take some of the props

386
00:21:28,107 --> 00:21:30,491
from the drama club this weekend
to the nursing home with me.

387
00:21:30,526 --> 00:21:33,494
The nursing home? Are you moving in?

388
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:35,279
No.

389
00:21:35,313 --> 00:21:38,166
I direct the residents in
productions of Shakespeare.

390
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,333
This weekend's our performance.

391
00:21:39,368 --> 00:21:42,553
Well, of course. Take whatever you need.

392
00:21:42,588 --> 00:21:46,124
How did I not know this, that you're
doing Shakespeare in a nursing home?

393
00:21:46,158 --> 00:21:49,260
I don't know. I've been
doing it a long time,

394
00:21:49,294 --> 00:21:51,562
so I never thought to mention it, I guess.

395
00:21:51,597 --> 00:21:54,499
That's amazing, Timothy.

396
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:56,200
I'm very impressed.

397
00:21:56,235 --> 00:22:00,037
Well, you needn't be, but thank you.

398
00:22:00,072 --> 00:22:02,390
And the Sunshine Valley Home for the Aged

399
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:06,444
production of Coriolanus
thanks you as well.

400
00:22:12,117 --> 00:22:15,520
She didn't "like" my pic, so I was
all, "Wish yourself a happy birthday."

401
00:22:15,554 --> 00:22:18,189
Ugh, just unfollow her already.

402
00:22:18,223 --> 00:22:21,159
I know, but then it's weird 'cause
it's like when does she notice,

403
00:22:21,193 --> 00:22:23,527
and when she does, does
she think it's an accident?

404
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:26,164
- Hi.
- Hey.

405
00:22:26,198 --> 00:22:28,249
Hey. I'm Callie.

406
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,302
We know. We're friends with Talya.

407
00:22:34,372 --> 00:22:36,507
This place is so high school.

408
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:40,389
I know. I feel like
everybody's talking about me.

409
00:22:40,423 --> 00:22:42,141
Who cares?

410
00:22:42,192 --> 00:22:44,393
Everyone thinks that I
stole Brandon from Talya.

411
00:22:44,427 --> 00:22:47,563
Well, you kind of did steal
from Brandon from Talya.

412
00:22:47,597 --> 00:22:51,300
Right, and you kind of did put
your underwear in Chase's pocket.

413
00:22:51,335 --> 00:22:54,370
Anyway, I know it's embarrassing,

414
00:22:54,404 --> 00:22:57,273
but in the scheme of things to worry about,

415
00:22:57,307 --> 00:23:01,077
what these people think of
you, it's not one of them.

416
00:23:01,478 --> 00:23:02,545
You're right.

417
00:23:18,512 --> 00:23:20,096
What's going on here?

418
00:23:22,615 --> 00:23:25,261
Mariana, would you please open your eyes?

419
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,953
No. Because if I do,

420
00:23:26,987 --> 00:23:29,255
then I have to acknowledge
that this is actually happening.

421
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:33,326
Look, honey, we just want
to talk to you about...

422
00:23:33,361 --> 00:23:36,229
the right ways to let a
boy know that you like him.

423
00:23:36,263 --> 00:23:38,231
Oh, my God, please don't do this.

424
00:23:38,265 --> 00:23:41,334
Sorry, but this is important, Mariana.

425
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:45,338
All right? We don't want anyone
to get the wrong impression.

426
00:23:45,373 --> 00:23:49,342
You don't... that's what it
was, the wrong impression?

427
00:23:49,377 --> 00:23:52,025
- Yes, nothing happened.
- Ok.

428
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:55,065
Mariana, where did you
even get such a crazy idea?

429
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:58,935
Talya. She used it on... never mind.

430
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:02,238
Yes, please, stop there.

431
00:24:02,273 --> 00:24:04,040
Look, I just...

432
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:06,993
no one would believe that a
boy like Chase would like me.

433
00:24:07,044 --> 00:24:09,079
I just... I wanted to prove them wrong.

434
00:24:09,113 --> 00:24:11,214
- Mariana.
- Honey,

435
00:24:11,248 --> 00:24:15,284
trust me one day soon,
much too soon for us,

436
00:24:15,302 --> 00:24:17,253
the right boy is gonna want to be with you.

437
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:19,289
Yeah, that's what everybody old says.

438
00:24:19,323 --> 00:24:22,292
Yes, and you should listen
to them because they are wise,

439
00:24:22,326 --> 00:24:24,994
and by the way, not that old.

440
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:26,329
Beat it.

441
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:31,234
Whatever happened to do you
like me, circle yes or no?

442
00:24:31,268 --> 00:24:34,971
By the way, I invited Brandon
and Mike over for dinner tonight.

443
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:36,206
What? You did?

444
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,159
Yeah, and Mike's new girlfriend.
I told you this yesterday.

445
00:24:39,193 --> 00:24:42,879
No, honey, just because you think something,
doesn't mean you ever said it out loud.

446
00:24:42,913 --> 00:24:44,114
Ok, then I'm telling you now.

447
00:24:44,148 --> 00:24:45,949
I've invited Brandon and Mike

448
00:24:45,983 --> 00:24:47,299
and Mike's new girlfriend over for dinner.

449
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:49,520
- You said that we should met her.
- I agree.

450
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,623
I think that's great, but I
invited Timothy over for dinner.

451
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,259
Timothy? Well, then you can reschedule.

452
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,593
- Come on.
- Why should I reschedule?

453
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,629
Because we know that Timothy
is not going to turn out

454
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:03,467
to be a 20-year-old hussy who might
someday be our son's stepmother.

455
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,469
It's too late. It'd be rude.

456
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:09,406
Well, fine. Then we're
having a dinner party. Whoo!

457
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,575
Let's break out the hummus.

458
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,464
Graffiti is a crime, you know?

459
00:25:17,645 --> 00:25:20,430
Ha-ha. No, it's, um...

460
00:25:22,784 --> 00:25:27,521
This is you taking the photos?

461
00:25:27,555 --> 00:25:28,722
- That's pretty awesome.
- Yeah, um...

462
00:25:28,756 --> 00:25:31,425
Michelle is bringing some
of kids from Girls United.

463
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:34,561
She's put the word out to other
homes, as well, so hopefully,

464
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:35,796
it'll be a good turnout.

465
00:25:37,832 --> 00:25:39,800
I wanna help them.

466
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:42,469
And I have to for community service, so...

467
00:25:43,771 --> 00:25:45,672
- They're just letting you use the school?
- Yeah.

468
00:25:45,707 --> 00:25:49,609
Lena's gonna come and
get me and lock up after.

469
00:25:49,644 --> 00:25:52,779
Cool. You're a really good person.

470
00:25:56,451 --> 00:25:58,769
Two men enter, one man leaves!

471
00:25:58,803 --> 00:26:01,555
Two men enter, one man leaves!

472
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:03,724
Two men enter, one man leaves! Whoo!

473
00:26:03,758 --> 00:26:05,642
Shake hands.

474
00:26:05,693 --> 00:26:08,445
Guess you shouldn't have
eaten all those scones.

475
00:26:58,479 --> 00:26:59,746
Congrats, Emma.

476
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:07,621
Hey, Foster, the bench
isn't gonna warm itself.

477
00:27:10,758 --> 00:27:13,427
Nice move. You deserve it.

478
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,635
Hey! Hey!

479
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:23,637
Why are you mad? You won.

480
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:27,541
It's how I won. You saw me as a girl.

481
00:27:27,575 --> 00:27:29,409
You think I let you win
because you're a girl?

482
00:27:29,444 --> 00:27:31,845
- No, I think I won because it got weird.
- It wasn't just me.

483
00:27:31,879 --> 00:27:35,449
I have busted my ass,
worked a hundred times harder

484
00:27:35,483 --> 00:27:36,783
than any of you guys to be on this team.

485
00:27:36,818 --> 00:27:38,385
I know you have.

486
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:41,555
On that mat, I'm not a girl.

487
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:44,491
Fine, you're not a girl.

488
00:27:53,584 --> 00:27:54,801
God, you make me mad.

489
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:09,375
Damn, y'all. This school is fancy.

490
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:12,161
Right? Yeah, it's way nicer than the ones

491
00:28:12,195 --> 00:28:14,463
Jude and I grew up going to.

492
00:28:14,497 --> 00:28:16,265
Hey, how's Daphne doing?

493
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:18,434
It's rough. I'm worried about her.

494
00:28:18,468 --> 00:28:21,070
Yeah, me, too. Does Rita know?

495
00:28:21,137 --> 00:28:24,073
They check in on her, but you
see that brave face she puts on

496
00:28:24,107 --> 00:28:26,208
- like she don't need no help.
- She's gonna go back to the gang

497
00:28:26,242 --> 00:28:30,346
- if she doesn't get Tasha back.
- I hear you.

498
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,381
You think she's gonna show?

499
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,249
I hope so.

500
00:28:38,488 --> 00:28:41,190
Hi. I was going to bring dessert

501
00:28:41,224 --> 00:28:43,492
but I'm a terrible cook, so...

502
00:28:43,526 --> 00:28:45,427
I doubt you're terrible at anything.

503
00:28:45,462 --> 00:28:48,397
But thank you so much.
It was so, so kind of you.

504
00:28:48,415 --> 00:28:52,117
Stef, this is my
brilliant coworker Timothy.

505
00:28:52,168 --> 00:28:53,402
Yes, we've met before, honey.

506
00:28:53,436 --> 00:28:55,287
- Hi, Stef.
- Hi, how are you?

507
00:28:55,338 --> 00:28:56,438
Good too see you.

508
00:28:56,473 --> 00:28:59,408
- Thank you.
- Oh.

509
00:28:59,426 --> 00:29:02,077
Hi, come on in. You must be Dani.

510
00:29:02,095 --> 00:29:05,080
You must be Stef. Thanks
so much for having us over.

511
00:29:05,098 --> 00:29:07,266
I've heard so much about all of you.

512
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,969
- I wish we could say the same...
- You promised.

513
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,022
Well, why don't out of the
doorway, shall we? Dinner's ready.

514
00:29:13,056 --> 00:29:15,107
Yes, come on. Come sit down.

515
00:29:15,141 --> 00:29:17,393
Mike and Dani, why don't you
come sit over here next to me?

516
00:29:17,427 --> 00:29:19,428
Don't you wanna sit next to your wife?

517
00:29:19,462 --> 00:29:21,296
I eat dinner with her every night.

518
00:29:21,331 --> 00:29:24,233
No, actually, Stef, I thought you
could sit over here next to Timothy.

519
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:27,286
Uh... I thought Brandon could sit there.

520
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,138
No, no, Brandon could just sit right here.

521
00:29:29,172 --> 00:29:31,040
Why don't I just move down
one, and then Brandon could...

522
00:29:31,074 --> 00:29:35,210
No, you're a guest, you can sit
wherever you like. Stef, just...

523
00:29:35,245 --> 00:29:37,997
Right here. Right there.

524
00:29:55,198 --> 00:29:56,432
Beautiful!

525
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:59,435
Oh, so cute!

526
00:29:59,469 --> 00:30:03,205
Yeah, back to back. Like it.

527
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:05,324
Your models are here.

528
00:30:05,358 --> 00:30:09,111
- No way!
- Hey, you!

529
00:30:09,145 --> 00:30:11,113
Oh, my gosh, hi.

530
00:30:11,147 --> 00:30:13,198
Aww, hey, honey. Oh!

531
00:30:13,249 --> 00:30:15,250
I love that you're doing this.

532
00:30:15,285 --> 00:30:17,352
And I heard back from some people,

533
00:30:17,387 --> 00:30:20,122
and we should have kids from
at least two other homes.

534
00:30:20,156 --> 00:30:23,225
Oh, uh, this is my roommate, Monica.

535
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:26,195
This is the one I told you about.
The notorious sandwich thief.

536
00:30:26,229 --> 00:30:28,197
Seriously. Don't listen to him.

537
00:30:28,231 --> 00:30:29,431
Really. If he gets on your nerves,

538
00:30:29,466 --> 00:30:32,167
just tell him to listen to
The Smiths. Works every time.

539
00:30:32,202 --> 00:30:33,535
- Yeah, whatever.
- Quit it you two.

540
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,522
- Let the new girl get her picture
taken. - Sign-in is over here.

541
00:30:40,226 --> 00:30:41,276
His parents won't take him back.

542
00:30:41,311 --> 00:30:43,545
So he's looking for a foster home.

543
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,065
One that'll take in a transgender kid?

544
00:30:46,116 --> 00:30:49,118
You best take some good pictures.

545
00:30:49,152 --> 00:30:51,403
Took you long enough. You were
supposed to help us set up.

546
00:30:51,454 --> 00:30:53,372
You know how many buses
I had to take to get here?

547
00:30:53,406 --> 00:30:55,290
You put your cornrows back in.

548
00:30:55,325 --> 00:30:57,025
Yeah.

549
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,160
So did you hear about the job?

550
00:30:58,194 --> 00:30:59,461
Didn't get it.

551
00:30:59,496 --> 00:31:01,263
You'll get the next one.

552
00:31:02,532 --> 00:31:04,416
I didn't know they had
schools on the beach.

553
00:31:04,467 --> 00:31:06,301
This is like one of them resorts in Mexico.

554
00:31:06,336 --> 00:31:08,303
What, they give you a piña
colada with your homework?

555
00:31:08,338 --> 00:31:10,055
Come on, let's get started.

556
00:31:18,381 --> 00:31:21,116
Yes, I love that.

557
00:31:21,151 --> 00:31:23,485
Ok, and just, um, look over here.

558
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,187
Yeah.

559
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:34,496
Do you see that boy over there?
That's actually my little brother.

560
00:31:34,531 --> 00:31:37,232
Hey, Jude. Come meet a friend of mine.

561
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:40,119
Hi.

562
00:31:41,304 --> 00:31:44,406
Perfect! Thanks for the assist.

563
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,210
I'm here for you, but I think
someone oughta take your picture.

564
00:31:48,244 --> 00:31:50,095
No. Jude, stop it.

565
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,147
I'm serious. Stop it.

566
00:31:52,182 --> 00:31:55,083
- Daphne, save me.
- No, no, no, no.

567
00:31:55,118 --> 00:31:57,436
I am no one's human shield, girl.

568
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:01,106
- Where's the girls room?
- It's down the hall and to the left.

569
00:32:01,141 --> 00:32:05,194
Wait. Just in case it's locked.

570
00:32:06,129 --> 00:32:09,064
Out. Go!

571
00:32:09,098 --> 00:32:13,118
- This looks amazing.
- Thank you.

572
00:32:13,153 --> 00:32:15,370
Hey, bud. Where you been?

573
00:32:15,405 --> 00:32:18,473
Sorry, studying. Lost track of time.

574
00:32:18,508 --> 00:32:23,162
No doubt grappling with the motifs
of guilt and deception in Hamlet.

575
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:24,413
Timothy was a Rhodes Scholar.

576
00:32:24,447 --> 00:32:28,116
- Well, that's impressive.
- It's really not a big deal.

577
00:32:28,151 --> 00:32:30,052
No, it's a huge deal.

578
00:32:30,086 --> 00:32:32,521
It recognizes academic
achievement and character

579
00:32:32,555 --> 00:32:35,157
- and leadership ability.
- Or in my case,

580
00:32:35,191 --> 00:32:36,325
an ability to write an essay that swindled

581
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:38,327
a committee to believe I had all that.

582
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,134
None for me, thanks.

583
00:32:46,152 --> 00:32:47,402
I'm sober.

584
00:32:47,437 --> 00:32:49,104
Oh, you're in the program, too?

585
00:32:49,138 --> 00:32:52,357
Five years. That's actually how I met Mike.

586
00:32:54,043 --> 00:32:55,077
They're sober buddies.

587
00:32:55,111 --> 00:32:58,146
Are sober buddies allowed
to date each other?

588
00:32:58,181 --> 00:33:00,015
Yes, if they're consenting adults.

589
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:03,218
You know, Bill Clinton was
a Rhodes Scholar, as well,

590
00:33:03,253 --> 00:33:05,320
- I believe, wasn't he?
- Uh, yeah.

591
00:33:05,355 --> 00:33:08,323
- So what do you do, Dani?
- I'm a dog walker.

592
00:33:08,358 --> 00:33:11,226
A business owner actually.

593
00:33:11,261 --> 00:33:15,030
She has five employees
and what, over 100 clients?

594
00:33:15,064 --> 00:33:17,266
Timothy is an animal lover.

595
00:33:18,268 --> 00:33:20,035
Big time.

596
00:33:21,237 --> 00:33:23,205
Maybe I should date Timothy.

597
00:33:30,313 --> 00:33:32,281
What is going on in there?

598
00:33:32,315 --> 00:33:34,516
I'm trying to figure out if that
woman is a good influence on our son

599
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:38,387
and all you're talking about is Timothy.

600
00:33:38,421 --> 00:33:41,256
All right. I have been thinking

601
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:45,093
maybe we shouldn't go with
an anonymous sperm donor.

602
00:33:45,128 --> 00:33:47,529
Maybe we should ask Timothy.

603
00:33:52,368 --> 00:33:54,269
Ok, maybe you should ask me first.

604
00:33:54,304 --> 00:33:58,140
I wanted you to get to know
Timothy better without the pressure

605
00:33:58,174 --> 00:34:00,475
of, you know, thinking of him like that.

606
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:03,345
Well, if you had talked to me first,
then maybe I could have saved you the trip

607
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:05,230
to awesometimothyfacts.com

608
00:34:05,265 --> 00:34:09,418
because I'm not comfortable with you
seeing our child's father every day at work.

609
00:34:09,452 --> 00:34:12,054
- Like you and Mike?
- Come on, that's different.

610
00:34:12,088 --> 00:34:15,290
Lena, the...

611
00:34:15,325 --> 00:34:19,361
Think about how challenging
everything has been so far.

612
00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:24,232
Do you really wanna open the door to
someone else's involvement in our lives?

613
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,034
The baby's life?

614
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:31,173
If it means knowing our child's history,

615
00:34:31,207 --> 00:34:33,442
yeah, maybe.

616
00:34:33,476 --> 00:34:37,379
Hi. Just checking. Can
I help with anything?

617
00:34:42,118 --> 00:34:45,253
Excuse me. I'm gonna hit the head.

618
00:34:50,493 --> 00:34:54,429
So, I understand

619
00:34:54,464 --> 00:34:57,132
you're a little concerned
about my sobriety.

620
00:34:57,166 --> 00:35:01,069
- No, I...
- You're worried about your dad.

621
00:35:01,104 --> 00:35:05,273
If I fall off the wagon,
he'll fall off the wagon.

622
00:35:05,308 --> 00:35:09,144
Which leads me to believe
someone saw me out last night.

623
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:12,014
I know I saw you.

624
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,285
- It was a one-time thing. - I
understand. It was for me, too.

625
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,023
I slipped up. It won't ever happen again.

626
00:35:23,393 --> 00:35:24,493
Are you going to tell him?

627
00:35:24,527 --> 00:35:27,329
Your dad has had a rough time lately.

628
00:35:27,363 --> 00:35:29,264
He doesn't need any bad news.

629
00:35:32,335 --> 00:35:34,302
So I don't see any reason

630
00:35:34,337 --> 00:35:38,240
to tell him about any of this.

631
00:35:38,274 --> 00:35:39,408
Right?

632
00:35:45,878 --> 00:35:48,476
Hey! Thanks for dinner last night.

633
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:54,419
I am so sorry about that. Oh, my God.

634
00:35:54,454 --> 00:35:57,355
About what? Saying amazing things about me?

635
00:35:57,373 --> 00:35:58,624
No apology necessary.

636
00:36:00,426 --> 00:36:03,295
I just really wanted Stef to
know how much I respect you

637
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,397
and how much I cherish our friendship.

638
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:07,266
Well, thank you.

639
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,202
And if you're interested in using me as...

640
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:11,603
you know...

641
00:36:11,638 --> 00:36:14,339
a sperm donor...

642
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:17,276
I'm in. If you want.

643
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:21,212
Excuse me. I need to speak with you.

644
00:36:43,703 --> 00:36:47,456
"In his role as the
Gentleman Caller, Chase Dillon

645
00:36:47,507 --> 00:36:50,409
has all the charm and skill of a hat rack.

646
00:36:50,443 --> 00:36:52,511
Though perhaps that is
an insult to hat racks,

647
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:55,213
which at the very least, have purpose.

648
00:36:55,248 --> 00:36:59,651
His performance is an insult to the
entire concept of live theater itself."

649
00:36:59,686 --> 00:37:02,187
"Also he abuses kittens."

650
00:37:05,325 --> 00:37:08,527
Wow. Honestly, that was much
nicer than I would have been.

651
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:12,664
How did you do this? Doesn't the paper
have to be approved by, like, a teacher?

652
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:15,400
Well, I might do the paper's layout,

653
00:37:15,435 --> 00:37:17,336
and I might have made a tweak or two

654
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,539
after our faculty advisor
gave final approval.

655
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:22,541
What Chase did to you
was a total douche move.

656
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:24,409
There's no way I was gonna
let him get away with it.

657
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:28,313
Why? 'Cause I'm your friend?

658
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,484
No, because I was righting a wrong.

659
00:37:32,518 --> 00:37:35,554
Sorry, don't believe you.

660
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:37,522
I'm like Batman.

661
00:37:37,557 --> 00:37:40,492
We're totally friends.

662
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:43,595
All right, fine, we're friends,

663
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:45,330
quit rubbing it in.

664
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:52,270
Someone got into the
administrative office last night,

665
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:56,408
and a number of Kindle Paperwhite
e-readers are now missing.

666
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,309
Do you know anything about that?

667
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:04,516
- Well, it wasn't...
- We know it wasn't you, honey.

668
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,452
During your photo shoot,

669
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,589
you didn't give my keys to anyone, did you?

670
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:13,492
No.

671
00:38:13,526 --> 00:38:16,595
I gave you the keys to go to the bathroom.

672
00:38:18,331 --> 00:38:19,631
I know your life's not easy right now.

673
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:21,600
So it's gotta be me, right?
Something goes missing,

674
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:23,385
it's gotta be the poor
girl with the cornrows?

675
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:25,470
- That's not fair.
- You called me out here,

676
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:28,273
made me take three buses across town,
just so you can accuse me of stealing?

677
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:30,559
They're making me give them a
list of everyone who was there.

678
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,360
I didn't take nothing.

679
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:34,646
But FYI, you know who
you can put on that list?

680
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,549
- Your boy Brandon.
- No, he wasn't there.

681
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:39,350
He was he was at my house having dinner.

682
00:38:39,368 --> 00:38:40,719
Well, I saw him lurking
around in the halls.

683
00:38:40,753 --> 00:38:42,454
So unless he can be in
two places at once...

684
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:44,623
Why didn't you tell me
last night if he was there?

685
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:46,591
He's your temptation.

686
00:38:46,626 --> 00:38:48,660
And we're supposed to have
each other's back, remember?

687
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,205
- Hey.
- Hey, um...

688
00:39:00,223 --> 00:39:03,575
You didn't come by school during
the photo shoot last night, did you,

689
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:07,429
- to say hi or something?
- No, I was at the house having dinner.

690
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,681
- Why?
- It's stupid, um,

691
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:11,600
Daphne said she saw you.

692
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:14,453
What's wrong?

693
00:39:14,487 --> 00:39:18,290
Some stuff was stolen from the office.

694
00:39:18,324 --> 00:39:20,558
Pretty sure Daphne did it.

695
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,661
- I gotta go.
- Ok.

696
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:36,208
Um... two things.

697
00:39:36,242 --> 00:39:38,577
First, I know how hard you've
worked to be on this team.

698
00:39:38,611 --> 00:39:42,380
So if I offended you
yesterday, I apologize.

699
00:39:44,717 --> 00:39:47,519
Ok, accepted.

700
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:50,522
What's the second thing?

701
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:03,335
What about Lexi?

702
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:05,270
I don't know.

703
00:40:05,304 --> 00:40:07,305
She's in Honduras.

704
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,707
Who knows when I'll see her again?

705
00:40:10,476 --> 00:40:12,611
Right.

706
00:40:12,645 --> 00:40:15,247
But I don't do cheating.

707
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:17,449
I know. Me neither.

708
00:40:21,654 --> 00:40:23,455
I think I have to break up with her.

709
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:40,471
Your cut.

710
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:44,376
When you were in the office
last night making the IDs,

711
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,278
did you steal some stuff, too?

712
00:40:46,312 --> 00:40:47,512
So what?

713
00:40:47,547 --> 00:40:49,480
Moron.

714
00:40:49,498 --> 00:40:50,749
Now they know someone was in there.

715
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:52,484
But they don't know it was us, do they?

716
00:40:52,518 --> 00:40:54,619
- No.
- So what's the problem?

717
00:40:54,654 --> 00:40:56,504
Someone's gonna go down for this!

718
00:40:56,539 --> 00:41:00,208
- That's a good thing.
- Ok, whatever you took, put it back.

719
00:41:00,259 --> 00:41:03,595
- Ok, this was not part of the deal.
- All right, Nancy, relax.

720
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:05,463
I can't just walk in and hand it to them

721
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:08,600
Just put it back or they'll
find it. Anonymously.

722
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:10,335
And don't take anything else.

723
00:41:18,277 --> 00:41:19,527
Oh, um...

724
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:20,712
No... I'll come back.

725
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:23,515
No, that's fine. What's up?

726
00:41:25,351 --> 00:41:27,485
So last night, um...

727
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:29,421
I just remembered

728
00:41:29,455 --> 00:41:32,457
I gave Daphne the keys.

729
00:41:35,761 --> 00:41:37,529
Thank you for telling us.

730
00:41:37,563 --> 00:41:41,633
Independent living is

731
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,668
a lot harder than she thought

732
00:41:43,703 --> 00:41:46,338
it was gonna be so...

733
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:53,561
What do you think?

734
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:56,247
I like the ones where they're
not looking at the camera.

735
00:41:56,282 --> 00:41:57,482
Yeah, me, too.

736
00:42:00,453 --> 00:42:02,621
I wanna see those.

737
00:42:02,655 --> 00:42:06,257
No, no, no... wait.

738
00:42:08,461 --> 00:42:11,329
- What are you doing?
- I have to zoom in.

739
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:16,501
- What's that?
- Let me brighten it.

740
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:21,606
It's Brandon's car.

741
00:42:24,377 --> 00:42:25,577
He was there last night.
