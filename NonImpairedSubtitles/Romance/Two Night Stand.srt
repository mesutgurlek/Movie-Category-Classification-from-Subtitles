00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:21,213
Shit, fuck.

6
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:24,083
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck...

Oh, Megan,
right where I left you.

22
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:16,622
How adorable.
You caught me red-handed.

23
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,557
I'm just...
I'm such a sucker

24
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,325
for the classic American novel.

25
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,731
Bad day?
No, I'm just exhausted.

26
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:28,734
Yeah, I know,
me too, right?

27
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:29,968
Oof...

28
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,339
Maybe it's time...
To get a job.

29
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,574
You're telling me...

30
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:36,975
Yes, I am.

31
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,144
I look for fulfilling
work all the time.

32
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,146
I just happen to be taking a
break whenever you're around.

33
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,215
It's like studying when
mom is watching.

34
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:44,816
Did you talk to your
parents about the lease?

35
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,251
Because the deadline's
on the first

36
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,754
and Cedric is willing
to take over if you...

37
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,822
yeah, no, I haven't made
a decision on that

38
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,759
yet, per se...

39
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,627
How did you not
make a decision yet?

40
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,829
I mean, what did you do today?

41
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,866
What did you do this week?

42
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:03,001
I did Christmas.

43
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,306
And I also started
online dating.

44
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,141
Seriously?

45
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,309
Ah!

46
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,344
¶¶

47
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,179
Yes, yeah, shut up.

48
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,415
No, I'm proud.

49
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:17,816
Meet anyone?

50
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,217
I said, started.

51
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,586
I'm not a machine.

52
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,990
Oh, oh, and, um, I also
really like that idea

53
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,092
of going Dutch
on principle except,

54
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,460
you know, I don't have any money

55
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:33,165
so it's kind of more
of an intellectual exercise.

56
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,666
Hey, whoa, where are you going?

57
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,702
You just got home.
Cedric's friend
is having this

58
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:38,136
birthday thing at this bar.

59
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:41,473
So then you're not
cooking dinner?

60
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,408
No... yeah.

61
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,313
Do you want to come?

62
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:50,582
Well, it kind of depends
on the cake situation.

63
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,084
Well, the birthday boy
is single.

64
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:53,452
And he's not
the brightest but he's pretty,

65
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:56,355
so he's perfect for
a one-night stand.

66
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,389
I don't know.

67
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,224
Do you think
I'm ready?
Who cares?

68
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:00,492
I'm ready for you to be ready.

69
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,627
I mean seriously,
how long has it been?

70
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:03,995
Aren't you horny?

71
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,630
Now see, I knew you two
little freaks be having

72
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,699
these type of conversations
when I'm not around.

73
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,201
I knew it,
especially you.

74
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,470
Hi, Cedric.
I knew it,
I caught you.

75
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:15,006
Well, yes, no, I'm horny
but I'm also...

76
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,275
Somewhat lazy, sometimes.

77
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:20,846
So the two counteract,
like dueling wizards...

78
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,214
not anymore.

79
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,950
Tonight is the night.
Faiza's setting me up.

80
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:26,385
I'm thinking Ben.

81
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:27,919
I like that,
that's cool.

82
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,955
(Whispering)
Ben.

83
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:31,289
Whoop.

84
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,058
¶¶

85
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,329
Hello.
Hi.

86
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:38,196
What's up?

87
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,965
ID please.
I'm a girl.

88
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,300
Uh, no, I'm sorry,
you look kinda young.

89
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,536
Take it like a compliment,
all right?

90
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,041
Shit!
How did you lose
your ID again?

91
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,309
You don't go anywhere.

92
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,345
Okay, wait, look,
I am old enough, I swear.

93
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,147
Do you see that,
right there?

94
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,015
It moves.
(Faiza)
Oh my God, Megan.

95
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,919
Hey, ID.

96
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,290
(Cedric)
Oh, shit.

97
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,925
Awkward.

98
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,329
Hey.

99
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,300
I heard you're doing good.

100
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,068
From who?

101
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,937
I don't know,
I just...

102
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,305
Said that to be nice.

103
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,140
Oh...

104
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,345
Chris, I think this girl's
trying to get by you.

105
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:28,747
Oh, no.

106
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,715
Uh, this is...
this is Becca.

107
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,151
Becca, this is faiza
and Cedric and Megan.

108
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,687
Megan and I, we were
together for a bit.

109
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:40,325
Is the abridged version,
just like that?

110
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,461
(Man)
You two coming in or what?

111
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,565
Nice to meet you.

112
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,333
(Chris)
Good seeing you, Megan.

113
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,103
I don't even want to
hear you guys say it.

114
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,772
Listen, if we knew that
he was going to be here

115
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,040
I would have warned you.

116
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,809
This is a serious pattern,
I am regressing.

117
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,010
Last year I was in college

118
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,312
and I was Chris's fiancée

119
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,380
and I drank wine in restaurants.

120
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:05,116
And now I am at home all
day in my underwear,

121
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,785
and I'm nobody's nothing,

122
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,286
and I can't even get into a bar.

123
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,588
What is happening to me?

124
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,189
I am going backwards!

125
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,824
I am Benjamin button-ing!

126
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,693
He moved on,
so what, so can you.

127
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,061
I say take a cab home,

128
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:18,330
get on that dating
site, pick a cute guy.

129
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,565
No drinks, no dinner,
just a hook-up.

130
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,034
You can't order it,

131
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,703
it's not edible arrangements!

132
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:25,971
Uh, yeah, you can.

133
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,706
You have tits and the Internet.

134
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,074
Cedric, back me up.

135
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:30,709
Internet, tits.
Mm-hmm.

136
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,978
Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

137
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,413
Go get them, tiger,
you got this... mwah.

138
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,517
Right?

139
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,187
¶¶

140
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,044
Ah...

141
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,068
Nope.

142
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,408
(Sighing)

143
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,245
Okay.

144
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,214
Fuck it.

145
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,183
He moved on,
so can I.

146
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,153
Hey...

147
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,229
Keeping it lowercase.

148
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,098
Keeping it casual.

149
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,503
Really?!

150
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,176
Okay... come on.

151
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:14,279
The bar is so low,
it's so very low.

152
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,459
I sound like a computer virus.

153
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,630
Awesome.

154
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,131
Okay.

155
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,813
Do you want to hang out?

156
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,598
(Chuckling)

157
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,741
(Chuckling)

158
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,878
Wait!

159
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,513
Oh, shit.

160
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,229
Safety first.

161
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,467
(Chuckling)

162
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,872
(Computer ringing)

163
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,342
<i>Hey, there.</i>

164
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:54,012
Oh man, I was... I was just
so sure that I was gonna see

165
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,513
a close-up of
a penis.

166
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:58,450
<i>Um, yeah, me too.</i>

167
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:01,186
<i>Wow, you are really pretty.</i>

168
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,620
<i>Really pretty.</i>

169
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:05,023
<i>Uh, anyway,
so this is me.</i>

170
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:10,995
<i>Soak it in, um, and this
is my apartment.</i>

171
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:15,734
<i>As you can see,
it's a magical wonderland.</i>

172
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:19,204
<i>So do I pass the test or...</i>

173
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:23,541
Um, yes, I think so.

174
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,944
I've actually... I've never
done this before.

175
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:28,480
<i>Me neither.</i>
No, no, no, no,
like I know...

176
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:30,115
I know that people say that,

177
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:32,383
but I really...
I haven't, nothing.

178
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,853
<i>I know, me either.</i>

179
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:38,423
Oh, good, um...

180
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:42,527
Okay, well, I guess then
I will see you soon?

181
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:43,962
<i>That is awesome.</i>

182
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,965
<i>I mean, that is cool,
sweet, I will...</i>

183
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,167
<i>that will be a very nice
thing to happen, Megan.</i>

184
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,835
<i>I will see you soon.</i>

185
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,904
Okay.

186
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,372
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

187
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,478
I cannot believe
I am schlepping to Brooklyn

188
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,579
for a Booty call.

189
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,414
That is fucking scandalous.

190
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,350
<i>I don't think it shut off right.</i>

191
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:07,252
No, no, the TV.

(Alarm blaring)

195
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,765
Is that a...
is that a burglar alarm?

196
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,968
Did you sleep with your coat on?

197
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,737
Yeah, I get cold.

198
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,472
Get the intruder!

199
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,542

200
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:32,677

<i>(Woman)
Alarm reset.</i>

202
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,283
False alarm.

203
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,318
Oh, that's so weird.

204
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,620
It's a bummer that
it woke us up though,

205
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:45,056
but I should get going.

206
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,358
Um...

207
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,328
I had a great time,
thank you.

208
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,833
It's, um, perfect
for what I needed, so...

209
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,835
(Snoring)

210
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,877
Awesome.

That's some alarm you got there.

216
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,344
Yeah, I don't even remember
even setting it...

217
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,346
For 11:04.

218
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:42,881
Weird.

219
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,353
Uh, morning, Megan.

220
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,388
Good morning, Alex.

221
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:55,293
It's<i> Alec,</i> actually.

222
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:58,096
Yeah.

223
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,732
What'd I say?
Alex.

224
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,203
Do your way,
one more time.

225
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,471
Alec.

226
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,773
It's got a "c" at the end of it.

227
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,208
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

228
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,410
It's okay.
Gotcha, sorry.

229
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,679
Well, um...

230
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:21,386
I had a blast, so...
Thank you for having me.

231
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,954
You're welcome.

232
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:25,023
My only concern is how
we're gonna sugarcoat this

233
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,025
when we tell our grandkids
how we met.

234
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,626
(Laughing)

235
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,561
Right?
Yeah.

236
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,298
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

237
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,565
So do you wanna grab breakfast

238
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,801
or do you
normally just take off?

239
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,271
Normally?

240
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,340
Huh?

241
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:43,908
You said, "normally."

242
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,312
Just... like I do this so
much that I'd have a normal

243
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,047
and an abnormal version of it?

244
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,581
That's... yeah, that's
not what I meant.

245
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,984
I have no idea
how often you do this.

246
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,953
I told you last night
that this is my first time

247
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:58,489
doing anything, you know,
remotely like this.

248
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:01,125
Yeah, but come on.

249
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,894
Come on.

250
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,429
What?

251
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:05,863
Megan, do you
expect me to believe

252
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,433
this was your first
one-night stand ever?

253
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:09,801
Yes!

254
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,469
Yeah, no, I mean, the only
reason that I am here

255
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,937
is because my roommate,

256
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,772
she peer-pressured
the shit out of me.

257
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,175
Yeah, she sexiled you,
or whatever, right?

258
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,444
Exactly, and yet I am sensing

259
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,879
some distinctly judgey vibes

260
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,247
coming from your
side of the bed,

261
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:26,150
which is odd considering
the team work involved.

262
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,386
There's no judgey vibes coming
from this side of the bed.

263
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,688
Honestly, I really
admire what you did.

264
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,924
I wish more girls were
that forward.

265
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:33,926
Forward?

266
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:35,893
There we go
with the slut thing again.

267
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,395
I'm not calling you a slut!

268
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,030
I'm calling you a girl

269
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:41,032
who went over to a stranger's
house at midnight.

270
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:44,369
If only there was a word
for someone who does that.

271
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:46,471
Wow, you know what, screw you.

272
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,805
That was a joke,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

273
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,508
You invited me here,
just remember that.

274
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,743
That's not quite how it happened

275
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,111
but it doesn't matter.

276
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:54,812
Look, can we please
just eat breakfast?

277
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,381
I make oatmeal with
a little smiley face

278
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:59,584
made out of jelly, and it's
not slutty at all.

279
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,552
You know what,
save your oatmeal.

280
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:02,820
I think I'm gonna take off.

281
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,555
But, um,
thanks for having me,

282
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:05,757
it was awesome to get
to know you.

283
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,058
Have a nice life, Alex.

284
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,593
Okay, cool, well,
I'm just gonna assume

285
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,128
that time was on purpose,

286
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,996
'cause I told you my name
is Alec with a "c"

287
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:14,132
like a dozen times.
It wasn't on purpose,
but don't worry.

288
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,467
You just have
a stupid name.
Okay, cool, well, bye.

289
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:19,337
It was lovely having
sex with you!
Aw, I wish
I could say the same.

290
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,806
Hmm, sounded like you had a
pretty good time last night.
You know what?

291
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,341
Don't believe
everything you hear.

292
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,343
Especially when it's something
like, "hey, Alec, cool name."

293
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,544
What is that?

294
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,779
It sounds like
the first draft of a name!

295
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:29,514
Okay, fuck you, Megan.
Fuck you, back.

296
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,916
(Alarm beeping)

297
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,284
Ah, okay.

298
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,059
What?

299
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,061

Ow, shit!

302
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,742
(Alec)
Imagine a sleeping little
angel-faced angel...

303
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,477
No, I'm the angel.

304
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:01,879
And this angel is being woken up

305
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:06,717
by a fucking junkyard dog in
a hot-girl body!

306
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,820
Okay, and that's my morning.

307
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:11,422
Look, I can't...
uh, mom.

308
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,924
I will call you back.

309
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:19,330
Hi there,
it's Alec, right?

310
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,631
Hmm...

311
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,633
What is it,
a little snow outside?

312
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,068
Yeah, hmm.

313
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,169
Well, new yorkers...

314
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,571
I don't want to say that you
guys are pussies

315
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:27,805
but seriously,
you should see what

316
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,608
a winter in Minnesota
looks like.

317
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,176
I'll get you a cab.

318
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,215
(Wind whistling)

319
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,721
Holy shit,
that is a lot of snow!

320
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,260
Hmm.
Hmm.

321
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:50,962
Hmm.

322
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,263
Wow.

323
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,998
<i>Hey, folks, I hope
you aren't planning</i>

Right, that makes sense.

silence with you,

It didn't happen.

383
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:05,830

that it's just the weather

and not your passive-aggressive
magical grandma.

Uh, no, no, I did not.

That's why you never let your

Your apartment.

475

I'm warning you though,

that I'm really cool.

477

My buddy made it.

I don't know if you can tell,
but he smokes a lot of pot.

483
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,112
It is a mystery why you
don't have a girlfriend.

484
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:24,715
Hey, I'm a catch.

485
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:27,217
I'll bet you 150 bucks
you're gonna die alone.

486
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,787
Well, my future
smoking-hot widow

487
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,455
will gladly accept your money.

488
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,492
(Bong bubbling)

489
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,300
Hey, I'm just saying,
you could afford to

490
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:44,902
take the edge off a little bit.

491
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:46,070
It could be good for you.

492
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:47,404
You should embrace it.

493
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:49,640
I've gotten high before.

494
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:51,175
Not with me.

495
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,346
Fine.

496
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,415
It better make you funnier.

497
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,685
Yeah, smoke that shit.

498
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:03,621
(Bong bubbling)

499
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,324
¶¶

500
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,963
So earlier you asked
what I did for a living

501
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,199
and I kinda got a little feisty.

502
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:16,634
You, feisty?

503
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,168
Can't picture it.

504
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,305
Well, the answer is...

505
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:27,111
I am less-than-employed
at the moment.

506
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:28,512
I don't do anything.

507
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:30,881
See, last year
I was able to say,

508
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:32,049
"I'm a premed student,"

509
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:34,952
which sounds kind of
impressive, right?

510
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:36,987
But then I graduated

511
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,589
and I'm not allowed
to say it anymore.

512
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:41,859
Um...

513
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,628
I think your profile
said premed student.

514
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,597
Yeah, no, I just
haven't changed it yet.

515
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,999
Didn't you make the profile
like two days ago?

516
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,167
That's weird.

517
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,136
What is this, like an
interrogation?

518
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:53,871
You got something to hide?

519
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:56,473
No, I just...

520
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,776
I think I'm just
in that limbo phase.

521
00:27:58,778 --> 00:28:01,912
It's not like your degree
has instructions on it.

522
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,714
Well... boom!

523
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:06,650
Home run, twins
win the world series!

524
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:09,787
Well, your degree did
say premed,

525
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:12,623
so you would think
something follows that.

526
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,895
(Ball grinding)

527
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:19,997
What was that?

528
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:21,031
Hmm.

529
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,800
¶¶

530
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,640
So...

531
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:31,175
Why did you major in premed

532
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:32,443
if you didn't want to
go into medicine?

533
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:33,944
I always thought I'd change it,

534
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:36,013
but then I graduated.

535
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:37,347
Whoops.

536
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,016
Wait,
how does that happen?

537
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:41,685
Easier than you would think.

538
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:43,353
What do you do for a living?

539
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:46,223
I work at a bank.

540
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,058
Fancy.

541
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,626
Banking.

542
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:51,061
No, just bank.

543
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,197
I'm an assistant manager.

544
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:55,899
How does someone like you get
into something that's so...

545
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,201
Wildly exciting?

546
00:28:57,203 --> 00:28:58,635
Yes.
Yes.

547
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:01,038
I don't know,
I mean, you know, like,

548
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,673
when you're 17 and...

549
00:29:02,675 --> 00:29:04,208
You just want to get out there
and show the world

550
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,576
everything that
you have to offer,

551
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,277
because you have all
this stuff to say?

552
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,914
I don't know
what that feels like.

553
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,316
I don't know.

554
00:29:12,318 --> 00:29:15,285
I never felt like I needed
a job to define my life.

555
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:16,620
Do you like your job?

556
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:18,922
Since when are you
supposed to like your job?

557
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,157
I think our generation

558
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,460
catastrophically
misunderstands that.

559
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,597
Interesting.

560
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,769
¶¶

561
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,307
I forgot the food,
I'm going back for it.

562
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:38,475
Huh?
No, no, no.

563
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:40,344
Please, allow me.

564
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,817
Now, I am impressed.
Mm-hmm.

565
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:49,920
'Cause it's like a Butler
that is also a rug.

566
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:52,456
For the man who has
everything except a rug.

567
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,024
(Chuckling)

568
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,595
You know, I used to
smoke back in college.

569
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,664
But one summer, I walked in
on my parents

570
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:04,001
smoking out of a vaporizer
and watching Italian porn.

571
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,736
Oh my God.
Which is kind of

572
00:30:05,738 --> 00:30:08,806
the greatest antidrugs
psa of all time.

573
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:10,440
That is awesome!

574
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,709
Kinda gross, but...

575
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:15,445
It is funny.
Growing up...

576
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:19,917
All of my friends' parents
were divorced, you know?

577
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,754
But mine, they were
always... so happy.

578
00:30:23,756 --> 00:30:27,524
They were just
so disgustingly happy.

579
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,428
It's a lot to live up to.

580
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:35,599
I think it kinda messed me up.

581
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:44,975
My parents are still
married too.
Yeah?

582
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:47,244
Good for them.
What?

583
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:49,112
Yeah, when I was a kid

584
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,714
I used to wish that
they'd get divorced

585
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,216
'cause I was jealous of
all my friends

586
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:54,685
who got to have two Christmas's.

587
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:56,854
¶¶

588
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:59,323
Unh-unh, hm-hm, hm-hm.

589
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:01,091
What?
You should
turn this off.

590
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:02,326
You don't like this song?

591
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:04,795
Oh, no,
I love this song.

592
00:31:04,797 --> 00:31:07,764
It's gonna make me wanna dance.

593
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:09,533
Yes, you should.

594
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:10,868
No.
Yes.

595
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,569
Trust me.

596
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:15,706
Oh, are you like a bad dancer?

597
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,374
Oh, no.

598
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,508
No, no, no.

599
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,912
I am an epic dancer,
but you see...

600
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:26,083
See, if you see me dance

601
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:28,986
you'll follow me around
like a little puppy dog

602
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:31,588
and it'll be
embarrassing for us both.

603
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,725
So you have to stay here.

604
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:37,361
For your own safety,
trust me on that one.

605
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:41,064
¶¶

606
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,013
Okay, um...

607
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:33,116
So I would just like to

608
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,919
frame the next question in
the context that

609
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:38,622
my diet doesn't
normally consist of junk food.

610
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,657
And with that in mind

611
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,592
hypothetically...
Yeah?

612
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:49,366
...if one were to need to
make use of a bathroom

613
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:53,337
how might one do that

614
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:56,306
in these special circumstances?

615
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,375
Stop smiling.

616
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:00,510
Uh...

617
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:03,180
That's actually
a great question.

618
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:04,681
(Chuckling)

619
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,084
(Knocking on door)

620
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:08,952
Are these your creepy neighbors?

621
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,787
Are you the creepy neighbor?

622
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:13,790
You're totally
the creepy neighbor.

623
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:15,959
Hey, Mrs. lopan,
it's Alec.

624
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:18,228
I just really need
to borrow your plunger.

625
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,697
It's kind of an emergency.

626
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:23,266
That wouldn't happen to
be their mailbox, would it?

627
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:24,468
Oh, yeah, you know what,

628
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,802
they're probably away
for the holidays.

629
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:28,638
(Chuckling)
You did not just laugh.

630
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,308
It's kind of funny.
Do you see this face?

631
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,010
This is my panic face.

632
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:34,344
Do we understand?

633
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,379
Yeah.
Okay.

634
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:36,413
We do.
Good.

635
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:37,714
Okay, have no fear.

636
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,750
The trusty coat hanger
is here to save the day.

637
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:43,553
Aw, shucks, I bet you say
that to all the girls.

638
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,655
We're kind of on a clock here.

639
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:46,790
I mean, there's a plan "b,"

640
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:48,291
but it might sound
kind of out there.

641
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:50,627
We are not
getting high again.
Yes, we are.

642
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:52,195
No, I'm just kidding.

643
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,897
The windows of this building,
they don't really work right.

644
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:56,466
So we can go out the window,
climb up to the roof

645
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:57,834
go to the other side

646
00:33:57,836 --> 00:34:00,871
and then get in through
the lopans' fire escape.

647
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:01,972
Okay.

648
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,845
Maybe just you should do this.

649
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,547
I'm not breaking
and entering alone!

650
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,309
The whole reason we're doing
this is for you.

651
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,387
Why do you have that?

652
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,989
My grandmother left it to me.

653
00:34:18,991 --> 00:34:21,358
Yup, all style complaints
go to her.

654
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,627
I see, mm-hmm, sweet.

655
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:26,930
¶¶

656
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,672
(wind whistling)

657
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,275
Let's do this.

658
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:40,644
¶¶

659
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,626
You couldn't just
shit in the sink, huh?!

660
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,030
What's wrong?!

661
00:35:00,032 --> 00:35:02,032
It's frozen shut!

662
00:35:02,034 --> 00:35:03,633
It won't budge!

663
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:05,402
We gotta go back.

664
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:07,504
There is no turning back!

665
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:09,106
Whoa!

666
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:10,841
What the fuck?!
Go, go, go!

667
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:12,642
Are you kidding me?

668
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,279
Hey, are you fucking insane?

669
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,782
I'm going to have to
pay for that!
I had to!

670
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,750
They will totally understand.

671
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:22,819
Look, you are a ruiner.

672
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:24,955
I am not a ruiner!

673
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,924
Sorry, I gotta pee, I had to.

674
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:30,093
You understand,
you understand.
No, no, no, no, no...

675
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,431
You are an asshole
in so many languages!

676
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:36,032
You understand.

677
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,369
Oh yeah,
this pee feels so good.

678
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:44,141
(Exhaling)

679
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,452
Whoops, sorry,
false alarm.

680
00:35:55,454 --> 00:35:56,920
Oh, yeah?

681
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:05,228
Oh, God...

682
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,164
¶¶

683
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,288
Just so you know,

684
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,691
I'm giving you
the silent treatment too.

685
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:35,926
I just didn't know
if you could tell

686
00:36:35,928 --> 00:36:37,360
and I wanted you to know.

687
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,435
(Water splashing)

688
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,675
Hey, I think we've
solved the mystery

689
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:53,043
of the clogged toilet.

690
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:54,878
(Megan)
Wait, what?

691
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,580
No, I told you I would do that!

692
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:58,114
What is this?
No, it's nothing.

693
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:00,116
What are you doing?
That's gross.
Give it back.

694
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:03,753
Megan, this was in a toilet,
that's gross, okay?

695
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:04,955
If you had a problem
with the reading material

696
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:06,890
you could have just said
something.

697
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,034
¶¶

698
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:19,336
It's just some stupid article.

699
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,708
It wasn't stupid,
though.

700
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,110
It was spot-on.

701
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:31,081
How pathetic is that,
it's so pathetic...

702
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,055
Do you really think my name

703
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:41,091
sounds like
the first draft of a name?

704
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:48,765
Yeah.

705
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,836
Like a good
first draft, you know?

706
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:54,504
Like it's really close.

707
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:01,411
And did you really fake it?

708
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,615
What are you talking about?

709
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,751
Last night.

710
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:09,919
You know, when you were making

711
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:11,254
what I would describe as like

712
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,522
banshee-esque screams of
pleasure,

713
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:13,823
and then this morning,

714
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:16,159
you called into question
their authenticity?

715
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:17,827
So...

716
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:20,297
What happened to like,
"hey, let's just pretend

717
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:21,931
we never had sex?"

718
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,566
Yeah, I'm over that.

719
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:26,102
Why are you even
thinking about this again?

720
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:28,305
I haven't stopped
thinking about it.

721
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:35,045
Oh, all right, well, see,
I just said those things

722
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:36,313
to hurt your feelings

723
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:38,048
because you hurt mine, you know?

724
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,783
Yeah, I don't really buy
that because I think women

725
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:41,051
are most honest actually
when they're trying

726
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:42,619
to hurt somebody's feelings.

727
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:44,454
Fine.

728
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:45,889
But this can't be the first time

729
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:47,624
that a woman's faked it for you.

730
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:49,959
Uh, definitely was.

731
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:51,261
You made your ex come, huh?

732
00:38:51,263 --> 00:38:53,396
Mm-hmm, yep,
pretty much all the time.

733
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:54,364
Yeah, that often?

734
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:58,335
And did she come
before or after you?

735
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:00,570
Usually we...

736
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:02,739
We would come simultaneously.

737
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:04,140
At the same time.
Yeah, yeah?

738
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:05,342
I'm telling you,
it's true.
Bullshit.

739
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:06,543
That's mean.

740
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:08,478
No, it's nothing to
be ashamed of either,

741
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,280
it's really hard to do.

742
00:39:10,282 --> 00:39:12,082
For guys it's so easy,
it's just, you know,

743
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:13,783
it's just friction.

744
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:17,687
But for girls there's a whole
lot of intangibles down there.

745
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,622
And it's bad that we fake it.

746
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:22,058
It's not good for you,
it doesn't help us.

747
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,060
It doesn't help the next girl.

748
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:26,396
Oh, but you're a really
great kisser.

749
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:28,465
Yeah, you've got
that down pat, it's just...

750
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:30,667
Practice on my
hand a lot.
...the other stuff.

751
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:31,935
A lot.
But I had a good time.

752
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:33,837
Okay.

753
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,839
Well, yeah,
let's talk about this.

754
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:37,874
So, what, uh...

755
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,877
Yeah, what did I do wrong?

756
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,779
Okay, it's not about
what you did wrong,

757
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:45,482
it's just how people sync up.

758
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:47,217
You know, how they fit together.

759
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,519
Mm-hmm, and we
didn't sync up well?

760
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:50,920
Do you think we did?

761
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:52,188
Well, you know, it's the first
time, it's awkward.

762
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,356
You don't know what to say,

763
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:55,024
you don't know
what you're touching.

764
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:56,559
It's awkward.

765
00:39:56,561 --> 00:40:00,563
It's not like that changes
after the first time.

766
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,932
Well, I mean eventually

767
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:06,102
they learn what
you like more, but...

768
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:07,504
You can never talk
about it openly

769
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:10,106
'cause guys are so sensitive.

770
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:13,843
Suggesting just the tiniest
thing and it freaks them out

771
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:16,679
because then they think you've
been thinking that every time,

772
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:18,815
and then they get mad that you
didn't say something earlier

773
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:20,116
and you didn't
say something early

774
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:21,551
because it would have
been too soon.

775
00:40:21,553 --> 00:40:23,319
So the only thing
that there is to do

776
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:25,221
is train them to recognize
different levels of moans

777
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:27,557
without them
realizing you're doing it.

778
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,492
In my experience.

779
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:32,829
Wow.

780
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:34,731
It works.

781
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:36,266
Or maybe it's just me.

782
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:38,067
No, it's like camp,
you know?

783
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:39,769
You go and you have to do
this activity with a partner

784
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,171
but you can't say anything

785
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:42,739
so you're just kinda stumbling
your way through it.

786
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:45,475
Yeah, it's just like camp.

787
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:47,744
What camp did you go to?
Holy shit.

788
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,312
I just had a great idea.

789
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:52,549
Do you feel it,
the two of us?

790
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:54,918
It's a pretty good
opportunity right now.

791
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,085
What... what is?

792
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:58,688
This... right here.

793
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,356
I'm not...
You don't get it?

794
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:02,559
Okay, look, listen to me,
so we're trapped.

795
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:04,961
We're like this incredible
experiment right now,

796
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,362
we're lab rats.

797
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:08,064
We've had sex, but we
don't have feelings

798
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:09,499
for each other, right?

799
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:11,501
And as soon as that
snow clears, you're gone.

800
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:12,936
Like Mexico-gone.

801
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:14,571
We don't know any
of the same people,

802
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:17,307
so we're probably never going
to see each other again.

803
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:18,675
Yes.

804
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:20,877
So we can use this time to
be honest with each other,

805
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,312
and we can
give each other advice

806
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,581
and constructive criticism
to make each other

807
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:25,782
better lovers

808
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:26,916
for the next
person that comes along.

809
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:28,384
(Giggling)

810
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:31,754
Okay, firstly, you cannot
pull off the word "lovers."

811
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:33,122
I think I can.

812
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:35,658
Secondly, what you are
proposing is potentially...

813
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,293
it's a horrible... it sucks.

814
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:38,995
It's a bad idea...
don't... what?
Are you kidding me?

815
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:41,498
This is the best
idea I've ever had!
That's so sad!

816
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,533
Look, Megan, listen,

817
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:45,368
you can't just like
drop a bomb on me like,

818
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,736
"hey, maybe you've never made

819
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,338
a girl come in your
entire fucking life,"

820
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,906
and then say you don't
want to talk about it.

821
00:41:49,908 --> 00:41:51,441
I wanna talk.

822
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:55,078
Guys can't handle constructive
criticism about that stuff.

823
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,479
You'll get all pissy...

824
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:57,947
no.

825
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:01,317
I promise you that I will not
get pissy if you don't.

826
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:03,052
What do you mean if I don't?

827
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:04,487
Oh, did you think
this was just like

828
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:06,189
a one-way street,
or something?

829
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,824
You think you
have pointers for me?

830
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:09,325
Well...

831
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:12,095
Yeah, a thing or two
crossed my mind, but...

832
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:15,732
I guess you'll never
know, will you?

833
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,336
Jesus, fine,
all right, I bite, go.

834
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:22,105
Okay, great,
this is good.

835
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:24,741
Now, this is not just you.

836
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:26,342
I want to make that clear.

837
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:28,177
Um, okay, the lights-off
thing.

838
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,579
What the fuck is that?

839
00:42:29,581 --> 00:42:31,514
If the lights are off,
like you requested

840
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:33,216
and I so gentlemanly obliged,

841
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,518
I could be having sex with
anything, literally.

842
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,921
But I don't want to be
having sex with anything.

843
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:40,256
I wanna be having sex with you.

844
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:42,692
Not you specifically,
but like the universal you.

845
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,429
Lights on?

846
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:47,297
Wow.

847
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:48,831
All guys feel that way?

848
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:51,067
I can only speak for me
and my friends, but yeah.

849
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,036
Duh, girls hear that
more than hello.

850
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:54,304
That's what you got?

851
00:42:54,306 --> 00:42:56,239
All I'm saying
is that we're young

852
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,541
and we're hot-looking people,

853
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:00,710
and we should embrace
that shit while we have it.

854
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:01,945
All right, fine!

855
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:03,913
Guys like to do it
with the lights on.

856
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,282
Noted, awesome,
shocked.

857
00:43:06,284 --> 00:43:07,617
What else you got?
Do you want more?

858
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:09,218
Do you have more?
Yeah, I do.

859
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,487
Okay, um...

860
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:13,256
What else do you
do that I don't like?

861
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:15,224
Okay, yeah, you do this thing

862
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:16,726
where you stand up from the bed

863
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:18,928
and you kind of
turn halfway around

864
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,965
and then you get undressed
as fast as you can all at once

865
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:23,099
and it's like you're
getting ready

866
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,867
for a physical or something.

867
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:27,236
I have never had any complaints
about how rapidly I undress.

868
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:29,806
Most guys like naked me.
I love naked you.

869
00:43:29,808 --> 00:43:32,442
Naked you is awesome
to look at and touch.

870
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,278
What I mean is that
you could make

871
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,415
the getting-naked-there
part a little like...

872
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:41,417
What's up?
Boop.

873
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:43,853
Then you take
your bra off the side.

874
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:45,822
You could even imaginary pole,

875
00:43:45,824 --> 00:43:47,490
just bring it, smack it.

876
00:43:47,492 --> 00:43:48,958
Bring it down...
oh God!

877
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,259
Bring it up.

878
00:43:50,261 --> 00:43:52,295
Do the little ass thing
with your underwear.

879
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:55,632
"Hey, I dropped
something, my panties."

880
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:56,733
You can flick it up.

881
00:43:56,735 --> 00:43:58,001
You could catch it.

882
00:43:58,003 --> 00:43:59,202
Then I don't care
what you do with it.

883
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:00,670
Actually
that wasn't terrible.

884
00:44:00,672 --> 00:44:03,306
You should put on heels
and try it.

885
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:04,941
Yeah, you're right,
this is weird.

886
00:44:04,943 --> 00:44:08,111
No, no, no,
man-up, finish.

887
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:09,846
Just get ready for an onslaught.

888
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:11,748
Okay, that definitely didn't
sound like it was in the vein

889
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:14,951
of constructive criticism but
I will continue, nonetheless.

890
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:17,587
Look, all...

891
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:22,692
I'm saying is that
guys like undressing.

892
00:44:22,694 --> 00:44:26,462
And you could make it
more of a... thing.

893
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:28,231
Okay.
Okay.

894
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:30,233
Lastly, when I was
inside of you,

895
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:32,335
you started doing this thing...

896
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:33,836
you started helping yourself
a little bit

897
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:38,908
and it kind of made me feel
like I was being benched.

898
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:40,510
Second string.
Noted.

899
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:42,145
Okay.
Duly noted.

900
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:43,780
Is it my turn?
Yeah.

901
00:44:43,782 --> 00:44:45,081
Don't ever do that.

902
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:46,249
Okay.

903
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:47,517
That's the international thing.

904
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,519
Okay, I don't know
who first taught guys

905
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:52,488
to do the "alphabet with
their tongue" thing,

906
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:55,491
but it kind of makes me
feel like I'm Helen Keller

907
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:57,894
being fucked by her teacher.

908
00:44:57,896 --> 00:45:00,897
And that is not
a fantasy of yours?

909
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:03,533
There was a moment,
one moment during foreplay

910
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:05,802
in which I was maybe
close to coming.

911
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:08,204
And I believe I subtly
pointed this out for you.

912
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:10,239
Do you remember what it
was that I said?

913
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:12,341
"I'm close to coming."
Yes, uh-huh.

914
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:13,743
And then after I said that,

915
00:45:13,745 --> 00:45:15,378
you switched up
what you were doing.

916
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,081
Just what was your thought
process there?

917
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:19,816
Um, I mean, honestly,

918
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:21,384
I thought I was doing
like a finishing move.

919
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:22,752
Kind of like
a "mortal kombat" thing like,

920
00:45:22,754 --> 00:45:23,754
"finish her!"

921
00:45:23,755 --> 00:45:25,354
And like really hit it, but...

922
00:45:25,356 --> 00:45:26,656
I thought I was
doing something like that.

923
00:45:26,658 --> 00:45:27,557
It's not...

924
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:28,925
Next time,
just, you know,

925
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:31,360
keep on doing what it was
that you were doing

926
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:33,463
because you got her to third

927
00:45:33,465 --> 00:45:35,798
and you can get her home.

928
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,066
Okay.

929
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,802
You waited for me to undress
you, which is unnecessary

930
00:45:39,804 --> 00:45:41,604
and also a little weird

931
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:43,673
because I'm not your mom
tucking you into bed.

932
00:45:43,675 --> 00:45:45,041
You kept trying
to give me hickeys,

933
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:47,043
which nobody likes.

934
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:48,444
Oh, and you went
like way too fast,

935
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:51,080
like you were drilling
me for oil.

936
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:54,550
You know, like my whole body
was like, "zzhh-zzhh-zzhh..."

937
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:56,586
And then... oh, oh, you did
find my g-spot,

938
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:58,387
but kind of like
a drive-by, which was cool,

939
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:01,090
but then you kept going.

940
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,392
And I so wanted you to stop.

941
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:05,328
Oh, okay, all right.

942
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,964
When a girl is helping herself,

943
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:09,398
that's a good fucking thing.

944
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,235
My ex was weird about
that too, and it's...

945
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:14,871
it's not like
we're competing on some

946
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:17,340
awesome erotic Japanese
game show;

947
00:46:17,342 --> 00:46:19,876
we are having sex.

948
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:23,412
You know, like,
embrace the team spirit.

949
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:25,414
Oh, and last night,
when we were done,

950
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:26,682
you retreated to
the other side of the bed

951
00:46:26,684 --> 00:46:29,452
like you planted a bomb
down there.

952
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:33,489
So next time,
just hold the girl,

953
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:35,792
count to like ten.

954
00:46:35,794 --> 00:46:37,994
It'd go a long way, that one.

955
00:46:37,996 --> 00:46:39,595
You can thank me later.

956
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:41,430
Other than those things,

957
00:46:41,432 --> 00:46:43,966
you were a perfectly
adequate lover.

958
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,968
Adequate,
wow, thank you.

959
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:50,840
Adequate's not really...

960
00:46:50,842 --> 00:46:53,109
See, I knew
this would happen.
...a compliment.

961
00:46:53,111 --> 00:46:55,444
I told you this
was a bad idea.
That's cool.

962
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:57,847
It's a fine idea,
I'm good.

963
00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:00,917
I'm like teflon,
baby, nothing sticks to me.

964
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:03,219
We should totally check out
the news though

965
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:04,620
for some updates.

966
00:47:04,622 --> 00:47:06,656
<i>As you can see,
this storm is showing</i>

967
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:08,925
<i>no signs of slowing down!</i>

968
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:10,626
<i>I want you to look at something.</i>

969
00:47:10,628 --> 00:47:13,629
<i>Behind me is
the empire state building,</i>

970
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:15,331
<i>but you can't see it.</i>

971
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:18,000
<i>All you can
see is snow.</i>

972
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:19,502
I bet you a 150 bucks

973
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:21,304
Rick Raines is
fully erect right now.

974
00:47:21,306 --> 00:47:22,772
(Chuckling)

975
00:47:22,774 --> 00:47:25,074
<i>It's like an incredible
disappearing act...</i>

976
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:26,642
That's funny.

977
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:29,378
<i>Okay, I'm hearing that
that's actually not where</i>

978
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:33,950
<i>the empire state building is,
but it does show you the...</i>

979
00:47:33,952 --> 00:47:35,751
Is it cool
if I take a shower?

980
00:47:35,753 --> 00:47:37,220
No.

981
00:47:37,222 --> 00:47:38,387
Yes, it's fine.

982
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:41,157
The towels are...
On the floor.

983
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:44,694
<i>Reporting from the streets of
New York City, I'm Rick Raines.</i>

984
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,701
(Water running)

985
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,024
<i>I just got off the phone
with the governor's office</i>

986
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:17,960
<i>and they told me this storm
is a real motherfucker...</i>

987
00:48:17,962 --> 00:48:19,195
That was quick.

988
00:48:19,197 --> 00:48:20,596
<i>I can't say that, okay.</i>

989
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,165
What if we tried again?

990
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:25,868
I can't take any more critiques.

991
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,838
No, no, I mean,
what if we...

992
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,406
Tried again.

993
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:36,212
Tested our theories for science.

994
00:48:36,214 --> 00:48:39,081
¶¶

995
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,483
For...

996
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:45,021
...science.

997
00:48:45,023 --> 00:48:47,657
Yeah, I think it would be
really helpful for me.

998
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:50,826
Because I'm more
of a hands-on learner.

999
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:55,932
Yeah, we could...
we could do that.

1000
00:48:55,934 --> 00:48:57,099
Good.

1001
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,567
Okay.

1002
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:01,971
And the channel of
communication stays open.

1003
00:49:01,973 --> 00:49:03,239
Mm-hmm.

1004
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:05,241
We say whatever's on
our mind, that's the deal.

1005
00:49:05,243 --> 00:49:07,576
Okay, we should
film it.
Hmm.

1006
00:49:07,578 --> 00:49:09,979
No?
Too far?

1007
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:13,149
Sorry.

1008
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:15,518
How should we start?

1009
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,621
Okay, so normally,
on date situations,

1010
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,289
there would be more of
a build-up here, right,

1011
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,425
but since this is strictly
a hookup scenario

1012
00:49:22,427 --> 00:49:24,460
I think it'd be
fine if you just...

1013
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:37,807
it's not bad.

1014
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:50,987
Whoa.

1015
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,799
Uh, shit.
Okay, see, the lack of sheets

1016
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:05,634
kind of makes it look
a little crack den-y.

1017
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:07,536
Which is great for like a
role-playing scenario but...

1018
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:09,672
yeah, it was
laundry day.
Mm-hmm.

1019
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:14,944
Okay, get over here.

1020
00:50:14,946 --> 00:50:15,978
Okay.

1021
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,880
They should label it
or something, right?

1022
00:50:17,882 --> 00:50:20,683
I think it's inside out
actually, but it's fine.

1023
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:22,718
That's good,
yeah, where were we?
Good, right here.

1024
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:28,657
Oh.

1025
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:30,059
Ah, a fan of the bed push.

1026
00:50:30,061 --> 00:50:31,193
That's a classic.

1027
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,162
Oh, no, no, no,
shoes and socks first.

1028
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:35,998
There's never a good time
for it so, you know...

1029
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,066
Get them off.

1030
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:38,601
Oh, God.

1031
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:46,442
Good compromise.

1032
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:48,511
I like that.
Thank you.

1033
00:50:48,513 --> 00:50:51,147
I'm like the un of doing it.

1034
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:56,145
Is that sort of
what you had in mind?

1035
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:59,248
Yeah, that's good.

1036
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,417
That's pretty good, you got
the hang of that, mm-hmm.

1037
00:52:01,419 --> 00:52:02,618
Good.

1038
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,620
¶¶

1039
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:22,304
I have sensitive nipples.

1040
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:26,342
That one is really sensitive.

1041
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:34,083
Any notes?
No.

1042
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:44,460
(Blowing raspberry)

1043
00:52:44,462 --> 00:52:46,695
No!

1044
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:49,165
If there is one thing
that you take away

1045
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:51,800
from this whole
experience... never.

1046
00:52:51,802 --> 00:52:53,002
Sorry, I was trying to
cool you off.

1047
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:54,436
My dad used to give me those.

1048
00:52:54,438 --> 00:52:56,338
And now I am just
thinking about my dad.

1049
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,340
Ew, that's gross,
I'm sorry.

1050
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:06,949
That's better.

1051
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,688
That is... much better.

1052
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,760
Japanese alphabet.

1053
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:21,197
Thank you,
rosetta stone.

1054
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:37,213
(Alec)
Holy shit!
(Megan)
That was awesome!

1055
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:50,226
Hey.

1056
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:52,895
Up and at 'em.

1057
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,133
Wake up.

1058
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:01,403
Hey.

1059
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:03,806
We fell asleep.

1060
00:54:03,808 --> 00:54:06,475
Yeah, is that a problem?

1061
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:08,210
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1062
00:54:08,212 --> 00:54:10,813
I don't see what the
educational purposes of it are.

1063
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:16,385
Plus, I'm hungry.

1064
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,658
Um...
We're gonna starve.

1065
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,293
Not if you like mustard.

1066
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:26,795
Why don't you have food?

1067
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:28,297
Well, I had food,

1068
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:30,799
and then we ate it all
when we were really high.

1069
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:32,868
Oh, yeah.

1070
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:36,405
Three-year-old banana?

1071
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,175
Oh, here we go.

1072
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:46,215
¶¶

1073
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,451
This might have to last days.

1074
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:52,321
We'll ration it.
Okay.

1075
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,395
This is good.

1076
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:01,096
All right, we just
need to get creative.

1077
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:03,432
Give me like... give me
ten minutes,

1078
00:55:03,434 --> 00:55:05,834
I'll figure
something out.
Okay, but don't hog.

1079
00:55:05,836 --> 00:55:07,102
All right, you wanna
go back to bed?

1080
00:55:07,104 --> 00:55:08,804
Let me figure it out.

1081
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,151
Special delivery.

1082
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:30,559
Where did you
get these?
Hmm?

1083
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:31,994
Don't worry about it.

1084
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,733
These are your
neighbors' noodles!

1085
00:55:37,735 --> 00:55:40,069
These are contraband noodles.

1086
00:55:40,071 --> 00:55:41,970
You threw such
a hissy fit about the window

1087
00:55:41,972 --> 00:55:45,441
and now look at you...
you are a common thief.

1088
00:55:45,443 --> 00:55:47,476
I know.

1089
00:55:47,478 --> 00:55:48,844
And, for the record,

1090
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,512
I actually thought it
was pretty badass

1091
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,348
when you broke
that window like that.

1092
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:55,117
Thank you, I did too.

1093
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,596
You might not
be the worst person

1094
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:09,298
in the world to be stuck with.

1095
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:11,867
Right back at you.

1096
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,472
So were your parents doctors?

1097
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:17,474
Mm-mm.

1098
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:18,874
Oh, I thought maybe they were

1099
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,175
and that's why you rebelled

1100
00:56:20,177 --> 00:56:22,745
and didn't
want to do it anymore.

1101
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:25,447
So what happened?
It doesn't matter.

1102
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:30,419
Yeah, it does,
come on, you can tell me.

1103
00:56:30,421 --> 00:56:32,721
It wouldn't even
make sense to you.

1104
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,056
Everything makes sense to me.

1105
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:36,024
It's the burden of
being a genius.

1106
00:56:36,026 --> 00:56:37,960
I can't help it.

1107
00:56:37,962 --> 00:56:39,294
(Scoffing)

1108
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:42,998
It's not, um...

1109
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,435
It's not that I stopped
wanting to be a doctor.

1110
00:56:46,437 --> 00:56:48,971
So you do want to be a doctor.

1111
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:55,144
No, I meant
I didn't change my mind.

1112
00:56:55,146 --> 00:56:57,513
I<i> never</i> wanted to be
a doctor, ever... ugh.

1113
00:56:57,515 --> 00:57:00,349
Then why would you
go into premed?

1114
00:57:00,351 --> 00:57:02,084
Okay, um...

1115
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:07,122
So...

1116
00:57:07,124 --> 00:57:11,927
I was engaged once.

1117
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,128
(Whispering)
Once.

1118
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,897
Sounds like
I'm writing a memoir.

1119
00:57:14,899 --> 00:57:18,967
Um, I was engaged recently.

1120
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:21,236
We dated through high school,

1121
00:57:21,238 --> 00:57:22,738
followed him to nyu.

1122
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:26,408
When I had to
pick a major, I, uh...

1123
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:30,145
I never actually planned
on needing it.

1124
00:57:30,147 --> 00:57:32,681
I just wanted to
be a wife and a mom.

1125
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:39,087
See, people always
look at you funny

1126
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:40,389
when you say something that

1127
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:42,357
'cause they feel bad
for you, or they...

1128
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:44,193
Megan, I'm not...
I'm sorry, I wasn't

1129
00:57:44,195 --> 00:57:47,262
trying to look
at you funny.
No, it's fine.

1130
00:57:47,264 --> 00:57:50,466
You're missing out
on something, but...

1131
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:51,967
Oh.

1132
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:55,270
I don't know, I mean...

1133
00:57:55,272 --> 00:57:57,272
It worked for my parents

1134
00:57:57,274 --> 00:57:59,341
and I always thought that
I'd do the same.

1135
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,646
And then the universe
called my bluff.

1136
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:06,515
What happened?

1137
00:58:06,517 --> 00:58:08,016
He cheated.
Oh.

1138
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:12,120
Yeah, and sadly that
wasn't even the deal-breaker.

1139
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:15,691
I wanted to work through
it, but he...

1140
00:58:15,693 --> 00:58:17,125
Wanted out.

1141
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:19,528
He said that he wanted to
find a girl with

1142
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:21,129
more of her own life.

1143
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:23,932
Dropped the word "ambition"
a few times.

1144
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:28,504
Ooh, yeah, I've had that word
thrown at me a few times too.

1145
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:29,671
Believe it or not.

1146
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,206
I believe it.

1147
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:33,609
Ambition is such bullshit.

1148
00:58:33,611 --> 00:58:36,345
Seriously, it's just chasing
vapor, like...

1149
00:58:36,347 --> 00:58:38,347
Whatever it is that
you think that you need

1150
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:40,482
like that job or that gold star,

1151
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:42,918
blue ribbon,
fancy desk, nice office,

1152
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,319
like it doesn't...

1153
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:45,988
like once you get that,
you're gonna be confused

1154
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:47,456
because you're not gonna
be as happy

1155
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:49,258
as you thought
you were going to be.

1156
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,759
Then you're going to be
sitting there being like,

1157
00:58:50,761 --> 00:58:51,894
"why aren't I happy?

1158
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:53,262
I have this...
I got the desk."

1159
00:58:53,264 --> 00:58:54,830
Because, man, there's
another desk.

1160
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:56,665
Like there's always
going to be something more

1161
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:57,933
that your ambition is telling
you that you need

1162
00:58:57,935 --> 00:58:59,468
so it's the next thing,

1163
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:00,736
and then when you get that,
there's another thing.

1164
00:59:00,738 --> 00:59:01,837
It's an endless cycle.

1165
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:02,905
You're forced into retirement.

1166
00:59:02,907 --> 00:59:04,206
You're kicking and screaming.

1167
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:05,507
The next thing you know,
you're in a big house,

1168
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:07,009
you've got four-and-a-half
bathrooms,

1169
00:59:07,011 --> 00:59:08,544
you don't even
have a ping-pong table

1170
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:09,444
and you're dead.

1171
00:59:09,446 --> 00:59:11,013
Let's fucking go blow shit up!

1172
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:12,247
Like you're dead.

1173
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:14,383
I just blacked out for a second.

1174
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:17,052
Thank you for
staying with me on that,

1175
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:19,388
I didn't know if I was going to
come out the other side.

1176
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:22,624
Blowing up stuff always helps.

1177
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,861
So what happened with that guy?

1178
00:59:25,863 --> 00:59:28,196
Nothing.

1179
00:59:28,198 --> 00:59:32,768
A semester later
I graduated with a degree

1180
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,237
I had no intention of using.

1181
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,675
And here I am.

1182
00:59:39,677 --> 00:59:42,477
So you've really never had
a one-night stand before?

1183
00:59:42,479 --> 00:59:44,580
I have told you this
like 100 times.

1184
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:46,822
Well, you should know, they
usually don't last this long.

1185
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:49,751
Well, that's a bummer.

1186
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:52,654
Wow.

1187
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,725
That guy is so screwed.

1188
00:59:56,727 --> 00:59:58,060
What do you mean?

1189
00:59:58,062 --> 00:59:59,394
You said that he met you
in high school, right?

1190
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:00,696
Mm-hmm.

1191
01:00:00,698 --> 01:00:03,699
So, he thinks that you're
a certain type of girl,

1192
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:05,934
and he thinks that he will meet

1193
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:09,004
that same type of girl later
in his life when he's ready.

1194
01:00:09,006 --> 01:00:11,173
But... when he's ready,

1195
01:00:11,175 --> 01:00:13,642
that girl's
not going to be there.

1196
01:00:13,644 --> 01:00:15,844
He has no idea how rare you are.

1197
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:21,149
What are those?
What?

1198
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,353
Those?

1199
01:00:24,355 --> 01:00:26,555
You're giving me
googly-eyes.

1200
01:00:26,557 --> 01:00:29,758
You totally are,
you're giving me googly-eyes!

1201
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,094
I'm just really
thirsty right now,

1202
01:00:32,096 --> 01:00:33,295
so those are my thirsty eyes.

1203
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:34,529
You look thirsty too.

1204
01:00:34,531 --> 01:00:36,365
I'm going to get us some drinks.

1205
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:49,478
Can I pull a classic girl move

1206
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,280
and confiscate your biggest,
comfiest sweatshirt?

1207
01:00:52,282 --> 01:00:54,783
And I promise,
I will not steal it.

1208
01:00:54,785 --> 01:00:56,318
Yeah, one sec.

1209
01:00:58,021 --> 01:01:00,188

1210

(whispering)
Please be a cross-dresser.

1211
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:35,791
(Alec)
I found some
peach schnapps.

1212
01:01:35,793 --> 01:01:37,192
The bottle was a little
dusty but I think

1213
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:40,195
the liquor
is still... good.

1214
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,704
So where's Daisy?

1215
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:52,741
San Francisco.

1216
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:58,213
You're with her?

1217
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:02,284
That's a tough
question to answer.

1218
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:05,887
No, it's not.

1219
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,858
See?
You just did.

1220
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,526
Megan, here.

1221
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:12,994
Look, let's talk about this.

1222
01:02:12,996 --> 01:02:15,530
You have the place to
yourself, and, boy...

1223
01:02:15,532 --> 01:02:17,399
Do you make the most of it.

1224
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:21,269
When does she get back?

1225
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:22,370
She was supposed to
get back this afternoon

1226
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:25,273
but her flight got canceled.

1227
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:28,710
I heard about that.

1228
01:02:28,712 --> 01:02:31,446
Apparently there's this
huge fucking blizzard.

1229
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:40,455
You know, I always wondered
what it would be like

1230
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:43,658
to be the other girl.

1231
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:46,428
It feels better.

1232
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,296
Not great,
but undeniably better.

1233
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:52,601
Hold on.

1234
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:01,309
Thank God, it stopped.

1235
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:05,814

1240
01:03:17,194 --> 01:03:18,326
Can I show you something?

1241
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:21,363
Please
just leave me alone.

1242
01:03:21,365 --> 01:03:23,799
I'm not mad.

1243
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:25,167
How can I be?

1244
01:03:25,169 --> 01:03:26,434
I didn't ask and you didn't lie.

1245
01:03:26,436 --> 01:03:29,805
I wanted meaningless sex
and I got it.

1246
01:03:29,807 --> 01:03:32,641
Let me show you this.

1247
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:33,875
Please.

1248
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:36,878
Read.

1249
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:43,051
So she dumped you but
you still live with her?

1250
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:44,452
She didn't give it to me yet.

1251
01:03:44,454 --> 01:03:45,787
I don't understand.

1252
01:03:45,789 --> 01:03:47,656
And honestly,
I don't care.

1253
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:50,392
Three weeks ago she asked
me to look for her wallet

1254
01:03:50,394 --> 01:03:51,893
and when I was
looking for her wallet

1255
01:03:51,895 --> 01:03:54,329
I accidently found this.

1256
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,231
I didn't know what to do.

1257
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:57,566
So I gave her her wallet
back at lunch

1258
01:03:57,568 --> 01:04:00,135
and then the next
day she left for tour.

1259
01:04:00,137 --> 01:04:01,970
Tour?
What is she, like...

1260
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:03,905
she's a dj.

1261
01:04:03,907 --> 01:04:05,273
Of course.

1262
01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:08,143
Of course, she's like the
coolest girl imaginable.

1263
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:09,711
I made that profile because

1264
01:04:09,713 --> 01:04:12,314
I wanted to have something
to throw in her face

1265
01:04:12,316 --> 01:04:15,317
whenever she
wanted to pull the trigger.

1266
01:04:15,319 --> 01:04:17,319
And I know that's very immature.

1267
01:04:17,321 --> 01:04:19,254
You could have
broken up with her.

1268
01:04:19,256 --> 01:04:21,323
Yeah.

1269
01:04:21,325 --> 01:04:23,058
Yeah, I thought about that.

1270
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:27,028
People talk about how
great it is to be single

1271
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,197
and that's bullshit,

1272
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,565
joining the single party.

1273
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:32,200
It's not a party, it's a bunch
of people

1274
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:34,669
sitting around
in the dark, texting.

01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:24,786
(Truck beeping)

1287
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:31,092
(Alec)
Megan, wait.

1288
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:32,761
Hey...

1289
01:05:32,763 --> 01:05:34,863
Come on, I didn't...
what was I supposed to do?

1290
01:05:34,865 --> 01:05:37,565
I didn't even know that
you existed, I don't...

1291
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:39,501
look, I don't
want her, I want you.

1292
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:41,736
I want you.

1293
01:05:41,738 --> 01:05:45,040
And what makes you
think that I want you?

1294
01:05:45,042 --> 01:05:49,477
You're just some funny guy
that works at a bank.

1295
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:50,979
I think you
severely overestimate

1296
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:52,948
your ability to break hearts.

1297
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:01,489
Come on.

1298
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:08,163
¶¶

1299
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:50,405
Oh my God, Megan!

1300
01:06:50,407 --> 01:06:52,073
Hey.

1301
01:06:52,075 --> 01:06:54,075
Hey.

1302
01:06:54,077 --> 01:06:55,543
Is that my duvet?

1303
01:06:55,545 --> 01:06:57,078
Hi.

1304
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,781
Oh, God.

1305
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,785
You guys
are monsters.
God!

1306
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:06,788
How was your date?

1307
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:12,193
¶¶

1308
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,812
You looked so tired
I wanted to let you sleep.

1309
01:08:03,814 --> 01:08:07,115
Hey, what are you...
Doing?

1310
01:08:07,117 --> 01:08:09,617
Daisy,
we should talk.
Yeah, I know.

1311
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:10,952
I found the note in the trash.

1312
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:13,088
I have the note right here.

1313
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,568
When did you find this?

1314
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:28,203
Um, when I was
looking for your wallet.

1315
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:31,606
By accident.

1316
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:33,975
I see what's going on here.

1317
01:08:33,977 --> 01:08:36,377
You read this, and then you
wanted me to come home

1318
01:08:36,379 --> 01:08:40,048
and find this slutty
little lipstick haiku

1319
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:42,117
so that you could be the one
that ended us.

1320
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:45,220
It's not a haiku,
there's not enough syllables.

1321
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:46,955
You are a child.

1322
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:49,357
Yeah.

1323
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:51,059
Look, Daisy, we both know

1324
01:08:51,061 --> 01:08:52,927
that we weren't
right for each other.

1325
01:08:52,929 --> 01:08:54,529
And I think we both knew that
for a long time,

1326
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:56,931
but it's fine.

1327
01:08:56,933 --> 01:08:58,299
We were just scared
that the perfect person

1328
01:08:58,301 --> 01:08:59,968
wasn't out there for us.

1329
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,671
And what if they're not?

1330
01:09:03,673 --> 01:09:05,173
I think they are.

1331
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:11,813
Okay, so what now?

1332
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:14,649
I can move my stuff
over to Kevin's place.

1333
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:17,986
He owes me for a plunger.

1334
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:20,722
Okay.

1335
01:09:20,724 --> 01:09:22,190
Let me know when you're out.

1336
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,960
Hey, Daisy...

1337
01:09:25,962 --> 01:09:28,062
Can I ask you something?

1338
01:09:28,064 --> 01:09:29,364
Yeah.

1339
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:31,232
Did you ever...

1340
01:09:31,234 --> 01:09:33,368
Fake it?

1341
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:34,802
Wow.

1342
01:09:34,804 --> 01:09:36,971
A year together.

1343
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:38,273
Done.

1344
01:09:38,275 --> 01:09:40,208
And that's what you're
thinking about right now?

1345
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:42,343
No, I'm thinking of all
kinds of stuff right now.

1346
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:46,281
I'm thinking of memories
and feelings and...

1347
01:09:46,283 --> 01:09:50,919
But I just need to
know if... did you do that?

1348
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:55,223
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1349
01:09:55,225 --> 01:09:56,991
I got lazy.

1350
01:09:56,993 --> 01:09:58,226
But you shouldn't have faked it.

1351
01:09:58,228 --> 01:10:00,361
Okay, because
that's not helping anybody.

1352
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,030
You gotta communicate.

1353
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:03,698
What happened to you?

1354
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,740
(Door closing)

1355
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:23,017
Tell her, talk to her.

1356
01:10:23,019 --> 01:10:25,086
Megan, faiza has something
she wants to tell you.

1357
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:26,187
Okay.

1358
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:28,790
Listen, normally
I'd wait to bring this up

1359
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:30,558
until after you'd
recovered a bit,

1360
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,094
but Cedric and I sort of enjoyed

1361
01:10:33,096 --> 01:10:35,930
having the place to ourselves
the past couple nights.
We did.

1362
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:38,132
And I wasn't sure that we would,

1363
01:10:38,134 --> 01:10:41,903
'cause I am so used to you
always being here, you know?

1364
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:46,174
Like... nonstop,
all the time.

1365
01:10:46,176 --> 01:10:49,344
Um, but...
baby, help me out, please.

1366
01:10:49,346 --> 01:10:50,979
Yeah, basically we were
just thinking,

1367
01:10:50,981 --> 01:10:52,347
what if you moved out,

1368
01:10:52,349 --> 01:10:54,549
you know, like what
would that be like?

1369
01:10:54,551 --> 01:10:55,917
And you have to understand,

1370
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:57,218
you can stay here as
long as you need,

1371
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,653
until you get on your feet.

1372
01:10:58,655 --> 01:10:59,921
A couple of days,
three days...

1373
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:02,323
However long you want.

1374
01:11:02,325 --> 01:11:04,359
Four days.
Okay.

1375
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:07,195
No, I think...

1376
01:11:07,197 --> 01:11:08,630
I think it's a really good idea.

1377
01:11:08,632 --> 01:11:11,199
You do?
She says she does.

1378
01:11:11,201 --> 01:11:14,202
Look, I only moved to New York
because of Chris.

1379
01:11:14,204 --> 01:11:16,604
And I thought
that if I went home

1380
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:18,806
it would just be admitting that.

1381
01:11:18,808 --> 01:11:20,275
So I stayed

1382
01:11:20,277 --> 01:11:23,011
and made sure that
the Internet wasn't lonely.

1383
01:11:23,013 --> 01:11:24,846
I needed a kick in the ass.

1384
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:28,416
Cool, so do you know
what you're gonna do?

1385
01:11:28,418 --> 01:11:29,617
No.

1386
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:31,586
No, I have no fucking clue.

1387
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:34,756
No idea, unh-unh.

1388
01:11:34,758 --> 01:11:36,224
Do you know what this means?

1389
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,361
That this is our last
new year's Eve

1390
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:41,496
as roommates.

1391
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:47,168
Awesome.

1392
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:51,005
Yeah, hey, so I realize this
is probably word-for-word

1393
01:11:51,007 --> 01:11:52,607
something that
a crazy person would say,

1394
01:11:52,609 --> 01:11:56,110
but I met a girl on your
website a few nights ago and...

1395
01:11:56,112 --> 01:11:58,179
<i>(woman)</i>
<i>I think I can save us</i>
<i>both some time here.</i>

1396
01:11:58,181 --> 01:12:00,014
Yeah, no, no, no, I don't
need her address or anything,

1397
01:12:00,016 --> 01:12:01,449
I just need to know
her last name.

1398
01:12:01,451 --> 01:12:02,650
<i>I'm sure it was magical,</i>

1399
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:04,218
<i>but we cant give our
customers'</i>

1400
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:06,954
<i>personal information to
anyone other than the police.</i>

1401
01:12:06,956 --> 01:12:08,423
<i>So, provided you're
not a cop,</i>

1402
01:12:08,425 --> 01:12:12,327
<i>is there anything else
I can help you with today?</i>

1403
01:12:12,329 --> 01:12:13,394
Nope.

1404
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:17,265
¶¶

1405
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:26,874
(man)
It's not just
a show for kids.

1406
01:12:26,876 --> 01:12:28,309
Anybody can get into it.

1407
01:12:28,311 --> 01:12:30,878
You know, it's for anybody
who cherishes

1408
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,014
friendship, adventure.

1409
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:35,516
There's this one character,
her name is applejack,

1410
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:37,018
she's my favorite.

1411
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,920
She's such a fireplug.

1412
01:12:38,922 --> 01:12:41,956
She kind of reminds me
of you, actually.

1413
01:12:41,958 --> 01:12:42,990
I think I lost you there.

1414
01:12:42,992 --> 01:12:44,192
Excuse me?
Hello?

1415
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:45,693
I'm just going to
put this out here,

1416
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:48,830
but you're kind of a fucking
terrible conversationalist.

1417
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:50,164
I don't
know if... if ever...

1418
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:53,201
I think it's
because you are so...

1419
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:58,306
...captivating.

1420
01:12:58,308 --> 01:13:01,008
I am just intimidated
as fuck... whoo.

1421
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:02,910
Oh, no, there's
nothing to be scared of.

1422
01:13:02,912 --> 01:13:04,946
Excuse me.
No, no, no,
please, please.

1423
01:13:04,948 --> 01:13:06,881
Godammit!

1424
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:11,319
Okay, yeah,
all right, great.

1425
01:13:11,321 --> 01:13:12,487
Son of a motherfucking bitch!

1426
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:14,589
Motherfucking
son of a fucking bitch!

1427
01:13:14,591 --> 01:13:16,657
Fuck!

1428
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:19,761
<i>(Rick on TV)</i>
<i>And now is the moment you've</i>
<i>all been waiting for...</i>

1429
01:13:19,763 --> 01:13:21,629
(Party horn blowing)

1430
01:13:21,631 --> 01:13:23,498
<i>Whoo!</i>

(Party horn blowing)

1432
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:29,237
Megan.

1433
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:34,575
Long time no see.

1434
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:37,445
It's Ben.

1435
01:13:37,447 --> 01:13:39,947
From bio class?

1436
01:13:39,949 --> 01:13:41,149
How are you here?

1437
01:13:41,151 --> 01:13:43,651
Do you know faiza?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1438
01:13:43,653 --> 01:13:45,052
I'm good buddies with Cedric.

1439
01:13:45,054 --> 01:13:46,120
We're going to get more booze.

1440
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:48,289
Have fun you two!

1441
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:53,628
You!

1442
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:55,930
You are the dumb,
pretty guy!

1443
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,965
Oh...

1444
01:13:57,967 --> 01:14:00,435
Uh, thank you?

1445
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:01,836
Mh-hmm.

1446
01:14:01,838 --> 01:14:04,105
I was supposed to bang you.

1447
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:08,109
This is the universe
correcting itself... oops.

1448
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:13,948
So where'd you decide
on med school?

1449
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:17,585
Just a surprise, I got
into both my top choices

1450
01:14:17,587 --> 01:14:19,754
but now I'm simply just
trying to decide.

1451
01:14:19,756 --> 01:14:21,556
It's a big decision and...

1452
01:14:21,558 --> 01:14:23,991
and obviously
my dad has opinions...

1453
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:26,494
Megan, Megan?

1454
01:14:26,496 --> 01:14:27,929
You know, it's just...
Shh, shh...

1455
01:14:27,931 --> 01:14:29,397
Police!
Megan?

1456
01:14:29,399 --> 01:14:31,165
Megan, right?

1457
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:34,101
Any noise complaints
go to faiza or to Cedric,

1458
01:14:34,103 --> 01:14:36,404
because this is their
apartment now.

1459
01:14:36,406 --> 01:14:39,240
Actually they're
asking for you specifically.

1460
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:43,277
What's up, dog?

1461
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,980
Megan pagano?

1462
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,683
You wanna step in
the hall with us?

1463
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,987
Why?

1464
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:57,592
Officers found this in
the lopans' bathroom.

1465
01:14:57,594 --> 01:14:58,993
You don't understand.

1466
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:01,562
This guy is a psychopath.

1467
01:15:01,564 --> 01:15:03,197
He's setting me up!

1468
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:05,066
He is setting
this whole thing up!

1469
01:15:05,068 --> 01:15:07,001
Which I realize

1470
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:09,136
is exactly what
a crazy person would say

1471
01:15:09,138 --> 01:15:11,305
but that explains my situation.

1472
01:15:11,307 --> 01:15:16,410
He is so crazy that he is
forcing me to sound crazy.

1473
01:15:16,412 --> 01:15:19,146
Do you see what he's doing?
Ma'am...

1474
01:15:19,148 --> 01:15:21,315
Did you, or did you not,

1475
01:15:21,317 --> 01:15:22,917
break in through the window of

1476
01:15:22,919 --> 01:15:25,019
Mr. and Mrs. lopan's
apartment?

1477
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:32,026
You, um...
You got a little...

1478
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:34,695
Some...

1479
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:36,430
Okay, got it.

1480
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,767
Pretty.

1481
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:45,039
(Lock buzzing)

1482
01:15:46,508 --> 01:15:48,376
Which one of you is
Megan pagano?

1483
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:51,946
You made bail.

1484
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:54,115
Wait, that's...
that's impossible.

1485
01:15:54,117 --> 01:15:56,617
I haven't even made
a phone call yet.

1486
01:15:56,619 --> 01:15:58,119
(Alec)
She can do that?

1487
01:15:58,121 --> 01:15:59,787
She can refuse my bail?

1488
01:15:59,789 --> 01:16:01,188
Are you serious?

1489
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:04,358
Okay, look, I just...
I need to talk to her.

1490
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,594
You can only visit during
visiting hours,

1491
01:16:06,596 --> 01:16:10,431
and if, and only if,
the person wants to see you.

1492
01:16:10,433 --> 01:16:13,100
Which I'm gonna guess she
doesn't, being that she would

1493
01:16:13,102 --> 01:16:15,770
rather remain locked in jail
than see your face.

1494
01:16:15,772 --> 01:16:17,371
Wow... rude.

1495
01:16:17,373 --> 01:16:19,707
Uh, okay, well,
what if I told you that

1496
01:16:19,709 --> 01:16:21,409
I helped her break into
that apartment?

1497
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:24,979
Then would you
lock me up with her?

1498
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:27,582
Yeah, that's how
police stations work.

1499
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:32,119
Are you being
sarcastic?
Are you serious?

1500
01:16:32,121 --> 01:16:33,754
I need to talk to her!

1501
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:35,456
Oh, okay then.

1502
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:40,962
(Crowd)
Five, four, three, two, one!

1503
01:16:40,964 --> 01:16:43,764
Happy new year!

1504
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:46,767
¶¶

1505
01:16:59,815 --> 01:17:01,282
(dog barking)

1506
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:09,724
(Lock buzzing)

1507
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,494
How about these two?

1508
01:17:13,496 --> 01:17:15,529
Are they special enough
to post your bail?

1509
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:17,798
Oh my God,
what happened?

1510
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,667
Just take me home.

1511
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:21,535
Here.

1512
01:17:21,537 --> 01:17:22,870
Hey.

1513
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,641
Who is that?
I'm sorry.

1514
01:17:26,643 --> 01:17:27,975
But I didn't
know your last name.

1515
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:29,043
What was I supposed to do?

1516
01:17:29,045 --> 01:17:30,678
Literally anything but this!

1517
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,580
Okay, you're upset,
but, Megan,

1518
01:17:32,582 --> 01:17:34,949
you felt something
and I felt something.

1519
01:17:34,951 --> 01:17:36,617
What I felt was
Stockholm syndrome.

1520
01:17:36,619 --> 01:17:38,753
Hey, hey, I can't let you
walk out another door

1521
01:17:38,755 --> 01:17:41,155
without listening to me.

1522
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,026
Why are you doing this?

1523
01:17:45,028 --> 01:17:46,127
You have a girlfriend.

1524
01:17:46,129 --> 01:17:47,194
That's over now.

1525
01:17:47,196 --> 01:17:48,996
Look, Megan,
hey, let me explain.

1526
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,665
I should have told you
about her, and there were

1527
01:17:50,667 --> 01:17:52,066
times last night I wanted to
tell you about her

1528
01:17:52,068 --> 01:17:53,367
and I should have,

1529
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:54,802
but there was
other times last night

1530
01:17:54,804 --> 01:17:57,805
that I forgot that other
people even existed.

1531
01:17:57,807 --> 01:17:59,473
And I know that sounds
stupid, 'cause your friends

1532
01:17:59,475 --> 01:18:01,976
are staring at me like my
fucking dick is hanging out.

1533
01:18:01,978 --> 01:18:03,511
(Chuckling)

1534
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,681
I'm sorry,
it was funny.

1535
01:18:06,683 --> 01:18:07,815
Sir?

1536
01:18:07,817 --> 01:18:09,150
Okay,
let's wrap this up.

1537
01:18:09,152 --> 01:18:10,685
The cop's not happy,
let's keep the cop happy.

1538
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,952
Megan?

1539
01:18:11,954 --> 01:18:13,220
You put me in jail!
(Whispering)
I'm sorry.

1540
01:18:13,222 --> 01:18:14,889
For like criminals!

1541
01:18:14,891 --> 01:18:18,359
He's got about five seconds
before he finds out firsthand.

1542
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:19,994
Okay, fine, fuck, shit.

1543
01:18:19,996 --> 01:18:24,165
Uh, look, not directed at you,
and not directed at you.

1544
01:18:24,167 --> 01:18:25,433
(Chuckling)

1545
01:18:25,435 --> 01:18:27,802
Look, I messed up.

1546
01:18:27,804 --> 01:18:31,005
I messed up, but I am
really, really sorry.

1547
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:33,007
But you can't stop us
before we even realize

1548
01:18:33,009 --> 01:18:34,175
what we could be.

1549
01:18:34,177 --> 01:18:36,444
And we should figure
that out, maybe...

1550
01:18:36,446 --> 01:18:37,812
Maybe we hang out

1551
01:18:37,814 --> 01:18:40,047
and we realize
we don't like each other.

1552
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:43,751
Maybe you're very intimidated
by my dancing,

1553
01:18:43,753 --> 01:18:46,954
or maybe I find out
you're like...

1554
01:18:46,956 --> 01:18:48,456
Really racist.

1555
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,559
Okay, that
was a hypothetical.

1556
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:54,662
Look, all I'm saying is that
there's a lot of stuff

1557
01:18:54,664 --> 01:18:56,363
that I don't know about you

1558
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:58,833
and there's a lot
that we need to talk about.

1559
01:18:58,835 --> 01:19:01,368
I spent two nights with you,

1560
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:03,304
and that's not enough time.

1561
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:08,409
Give me more time,
please.

1562
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,213
(Cedric)
It was a little shaky
in the middle

1563
01:19:12,215 --> 01:19:13,247
but he finished strong.

1564
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:14,915
I'm touched.

1565
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:17,251
Megan,
what do we think?

1566
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:22,890
I think you put me in jail.

1567
01:19:22,892 --> 01:19:23,991
We're still on that?

1568
01:19:23,993 --> 01:19:25,326
Look,
hey, hey, come on.

1569
01:19:25,328 --> 01:19:27,561
Some day you're gonna
laugh about this.

1570
01:19:27,563 --> 01:19:29,130
I promise that
you're gonna find this

1571
01:19:29,132 --> 01:19:31,432
all very funny some day.

1572
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:34,401
Okay, let's make a deal.

1573
01:19:34,403 --> 01:19:38,072
You give me your number,
and leave.

1574
01:19:38,074 --> 01:19:40,307
And the minute I laugh about it,

1575
01:19:40,309 --> 01:19:41,909
I'll let you know.

1576
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:10,437
(Officer)
Stay as long as you want.

1577
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:11,939
That guy was nuts.

1578
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:19,079
Can I hang out
with him?
Cedric!

1579
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:21,649
I'm just saying, I don't
meet a lot of funny people.

1580
01:20:21,651 --> 01:20:23,851
Okay, funny people don't
drive ambulances.

1581
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:30,891
(Laughing)

1582
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:36,964

1583
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:42,837

1585

<i>(Alec)
Hello?</i>

1586
01:20:48,311 --> 01:20:49,577
You are kind of an idiot,

1587
01:20:49,579 --> 01:20:51,145
do you realize
that about yourself?

1588
01:20:51,147 --> 01:20:52,713
You good?

1589
01:20:52,715 --> 01:20:54,448
<i>Yeah, I've heard that.</i>

1590
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,116
You know that was all me, right?

1591
01:20:56,118 --> 01:20:57,785
No, it was not.
What the fuck are you
talking about?

1592
01:20:57,787 --> 01:20:59,186
It was.

1593
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:00,855
...do you think in the spirit
of constructive criticism,

1594
01:21:00,857 --> 01:21:02,356
the next time you
wanna win a girl back

1595
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:03,757
after doing something stupid,

1596
01:21:03,759 --> 01:21:06,393
like practice your speech,
or something

1597
01:21:06,395 --> 01:21:09,196
for the next girl, because...

1598
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:12,700
I'm gonna be honest...
yours just fucking sucked!

1599
01:21:12,702 --> 01:21:15,536
Shit, it was... I was
embarrassed for you...

1600
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:26,280
mm-mm.
Mm, mm, what?

1601
01:21:26,282 --> 01:21:27,715
It's way too soon.

1602
01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:31,285
Way too soon.
That's fair.

1603
01:21:31,287 --> 01:21:32,887
That's totally fair.

1604
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:38,626
¶¶

1605
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:44,698
Okay, I'm sorry that
I put you in jail,

1606
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:45,933
but have you thought
about what that's

1607
01:21:45,935 --> 01:21:47,134
going to do for
your street cred?

1608
01:21:47,136 --> 01:21:48,402
Yeah, of course, I have,

1609
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:49,837
that was like the first
thing I thought of.

1610
01:21:49,839 --> 01:21:51,805
Gonna get that shit tattooed.

1611
01:21:51,807 --> 01:21:53,374
And you don't
have to worry about

1612
01:21:53,376 --> 01:21:55,943
the lopans pressing charges
'cause I took care of 'em.

1613
01:21:55,945 --> 01:21:57,945
Did you
murder the lopans?
It had to be done.

1614
01:21:57,947 --> 01:21:59,313
You did it without me?
Mm-hmm.

1615
01:21:59,315 --> 01:22:01,215
Ahh...

1616
01:22:01,217 --> 01:22:02,917
I think I'm ready
for that kiss now.

1617
01:22:02,919 --> 01:22:04,051
Yeah?
Yeah.

1618
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:13,594
You taste like prison.

1619
01:22:13,596 --> 01:22:16,764
Is it really
snowing again?
Oh, yeah.

1620
01:22:16,766 --> 01:22:20,567
Look at 'em, a million tiny,
little matchmakers.

1621
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:22,436
Thank you, snowflakes.

1622
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:26,840
So...
Your place or mine?

1623
01:22:26,842 --> 01:22:28,976
I don't have a place anymore.

1624
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:32,246
Me neither.

1625
01:22:32,248 --> 01:22:35,115
You are a catch.

1626
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:36,417
So are you.

1627
01:22:36,419 --> 01:22:38,686
