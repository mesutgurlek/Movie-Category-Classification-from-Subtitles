1
00:01:05,762 --> 00:01:07,462
Is this madness?

2
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:15,468
How...How could it be?

3
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:18,668
In that cave...

4
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:20,469
Free me.

5
00:01:20,537 --> 00:01:23,839
How could I have
seen myself...

6
00:01:23,907 --> 00:01:27,375
..when I was not yet myself?

7
00:01:27,443 --> 00:01:30,411
The Sons of Mithras have been
entwined with your destiny

8
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,781
since long before
you were born, Leonardo.

9
00:01:35,016 --> 00:01:36,645
Time is a river,

10
00:01:36,712 --> 00:01:38,802
and there are members of our
fraternity who have learned

11
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:43,557
to navigate it - both upstream
and downstream.

12
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,818
You may think
that you're not yet yourself

13
00:01:46,886 --> 00:01:51,374
but, in every moment, you are
both the child you once were

14
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:55,600
and the sage
you will some day be.

15
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:59,858
- That's not an answer.
- I never promised you answers.

16
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:03,450
For those, you will need
to find the Book of Leaves.

17
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:08,043
Answers to questions
that haunt all men.

18
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:11,567
Questions that haunt you.

19
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,423
- The fate of my mother.
- And more.

20
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:19,717
I speak of your destiny.

21
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:35,148
Much as I enjoy
the entertainment, signor,

22
00:02:35,216 --> 00:02:37,878
we came to talk to the Duke
about hiring his mercenaries,

23
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:40,905
not to watch them
beat each other senseless.

24
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,601
Some mead,
fine sirs?

25
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:44,930
Thank you.
Yes, indeed.

26
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:46,926
We mull it with
a little honey.

27
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:50,051
The pride of
the Duchy of Urbino.

28
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:53,411
- A little honey?
- Just fucking drink it.

29
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,643
Brilliant! Bravo!

30
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:12,203
- Medici!
- Urbino!

31
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,664
You know you fight like a man who's
not seen battle for far too long.

32
00:03:15,732 --> 00:03:17,727
- It's been too many years.
- Yes.

33
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:20,286
Federico da Montefeltro,
Duke of Urbino.

34
00:03:20,354 --> 00:03:21,718
Leonardo Da Vinci.

35
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:42,032
Reading? My!

36
00:03:43,795 --> 00:03:48,086
This primer was given to me
by Gentile Becchi.

37
00:03:48,154 --> 00:03:50,610
You mourn him still.

38
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:59,089
How may I serve you,
sister-in-law?

39
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:03,215
We are due to hold a pageant for
Martedi Grasso, some days hence.

40
00:04:03,282 --> 00:04:04,744
I hoped you might
escort me.

41
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,171
Even if Lorenzo returns
from his diplomatic forays,

42
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,896
he usually finds pressing
business when the revels begin.

43
00:04:11,964 --> 00:04:14,326
At least he pays for
the revels.

44
00:04:14,391 --> 00:04:17,850
But what is a lady
to do for a partner?

45
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,213
I can only thank heaven
Lorenzo has a brother

46
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:22,439
who knows his way around
a dance floor.

47
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:28,693
Mm. You must forgive me,
but I have a plot to unravel.

48
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,917
Becchi charged me with ferreting
out the spy within our midst.

49
00:04:32,985 --> 00:04:35,511
But the evidence against Becchi
was overwhelming.

50
00:04:35,578 --> 00:04:38,872
Testament to
the ability of our spy.

51
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:43,395
He is a kind of genius.

52
00:04:43,462 --> 00:04:49,583
I will soldier on at the revels
without you, then.

53
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:52,510
I'm touched at
your dedication.

54
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:57,401
The fact that, for all
your opportunities...

55
00:04:57,468 --> 00:05:03,192
..you're so intent on doing
the right thing.

56
00:05:03,257 --> 00:05:08,049
Maybe your most
attractive quality.

57
00:05:08,117 --> 00:05:11,239
My lady, it is time.

58
00:05:11,307 --> 00:05:14,136
My personal torturer
has arrived.

59
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,832
- You know we have no choice.
- Mm.

60
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,392
Twice a day,
I must down this potion

61
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,884
if I'm to produce a boy,
after my earlier failures.

62
00:05:24,952 --> 00:05:27,177
Oh, Moses, tell Giuliano
what's in this.

63
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:29,109
I cannot bring myself
to say the words.

64
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:31,236
Asses' milk,
powdered goats' antlers,

65
00:05:31,304 --> 00:05:33,799
bull's testicles...

66
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,441
Giuliano, you could spare me
this liquid atrocity

67
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:38,146
if you would father
a son yourself.

68
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,715
If we do not produce
a male heir soon,

69
00:05:40,782 --> 00:05:42,284
somewhere in our line,

70
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:43,919
the house of Medici
will start

71
00:05:43,986 --> 00:05:45,587
to look like
an unstable investment.

72
00:05:45,655 --> 00:05:48,789
We each have our duty, I see.

73
00:05:48,857 --> 00:05:50,557
Salut.

74
00:05:59,132 --> 00:06:00,766
It's there.

75
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:03,802
Logic dictates
that land lies due west.

76
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,741
You think the identification of
a simple cardinal direction

77
00:06:08,808 --> 00:06:10,876
is all you need
to find your goal?

78
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:12,712
It's all I need
to get started.

79
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,481
You could spend a hundred
lifetimes traveling west,

80
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:17,250
could you not?

81
00:06:18,786 --> 00:06:21,388
The map Avraham ben Yosef
brought to Florence

82
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:23,890
is not an original,
but a reproduction,

83
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:27,361
riddled with notations that
only one man can decipher.

84
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,130
The cartographer
who copied it.

85
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:33,601
- Another Son of Mithras?
- His name is Solomon Ogbai.

86
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:35,403
We call him
the Abyssinian.

87
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:40,642
Lucky for you,
he is not dead.

88
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,512
Not yet.

89
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:47,282
You have yet to save him.

90
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,985
His retinue was
brutally intercepted

91
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:53,322
while he was traveling under the
employ of the Ottoman Sultan.

92
00:06:54,758 --> 00:06:59,830
A most savage warlord
holds him captive.

93
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:05,235
The Abyssinian cannot be freed by
simple diplomacy, or even ransom.

94
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:09,773
It will take guile and inventiveness
- which only you possess.

95
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,812
These are delicate times.
I have commitments to Florence.

96
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,883
Your destiny lies elsewhere,
Leonardo.

97
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,352
Save the Abyssinian
while he still breathes.

98
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:28,359
I have to think it over,
I can't...

99
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:31,499
You've already
thought it over.

100
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:36,409
In truth, your journey
has already begun.

101
00:07:37,878 --> 00:07:42,283
Time...is a river.

102
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:55,869
You have already made
the decision.

103
00:07:58,774 --> 00:08:00,508
You make it every time.

104
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,697
He's done the coin thing,
has he?

105
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:29,104
You're the map maker.

106
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:31,940
I thought
you needed rescuing?

107
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:36,411
- I will.
- In the future?

108
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,214
The sooner you move beyond words
like present and future,

109
00:08:39,282 --> 00:08:42,884
the sooner you become
the man we need you to be.

110
00:08:42,952 --> 00:08:45,554
Are all the Sons of Mithras
unable to speak plainly?

111
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,960
I admit, on occasion, we can be
inscrutable, but so can you.

112
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:56,030
I wanted to meet
the storied Da Vinci

113
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:58,800
in the bright of day.

114
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:02,604
We're different men,
once Hell breaks loose.

115
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:05,239
And when's that happen?

116
00:09:05,307 --> 00:09:06,774
Hell happens when

117
00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:08,843
the evil of this world
exceeds our belief

118
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,378
that we can conquer it.

119
00:09:11,713 --> 00:09:13,681
You ask me when
you'll reach that point.

120
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:15,382
I cannot say.

121
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,351
Depends on you.

122
00:09:18,754 --> 00:09:22,523
Whatever befalls us,
do not shirk from the task.

123
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:24,925
I have a knack of rising
to the occasion,

124
00:09:24,993 --> 00:09:28,896
if I might only be told
what the occasion is...

125
00:09:28,964 --> 00:09:30,464
I venture to say it's true

126
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:32,867
what the Sons of Mithras
have seen you in you,

127
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:35,603
and you are closer
every day, artista.

128
00:09:36,705 --> 00:09:39,241
- Closer to what?
- Wake up.

129
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:50,052
Where are you leading me?

130
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,855
L-leading you? Maestro,
you're the one leading us.

131
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:54,323
What?

132
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:57,393
You woke us in the night, gave
us one of your shopping lists.

133
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,295
Buy more magnesium,

134
00:09:59,362 --> 00:10:01,530
obtain obscure alcoholic
beverages from the East,

135
00:10:01,598 --> 00:10:03,298
acquire three horses...

136
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:05,834
You had some plan.
Do you not remember?

137
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:09,370
I do, I do. I remember it.

138
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:10,972
- How long have we...
- Days.

139
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,107
You've been a sullen fuck
the entire trip,

140
00:10:13,175 --> 00:10:15,810
all for some foreign halfwit
who got himself abducted.

141
00:10:15,878 --> 00:10:18,846
- The Abyssinian.
- It's like...

142
00:10:18,914 --> 00:10:21,349
It's like
I'm just waking up.

143
00:10:23,552 --> 00:10:25,386
I lost part of myself
on the journey.

144
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:29,323
- Journey where?
- It's not where...

145
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:30,991
..it's when.

146
00:10:40,635 --> 00:10:43,170
The evils of this world.

147
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:45,339
There's something odd
around the castle.

148
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:55,114
- What's this?
- You'll see what it does.

149
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:58,284
Whose kingdom is this?

150
00:10:58,352 --> 00:11:00,553
The locals call him Tepes.

151
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:02,755
That's the man
we've come to confront?

152
00:11:02,823 --> 00:11:05,158
The one who has your captive
is the fucking Impaler?

153
00:11:13,668 --> 00:11:15,535
I lost my right eye in battle.

154
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:19,139
Removed the bridge of my nose,
so I'd still have peripheral vision.

155
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:22,442
There.

156
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,311
Clever, eh?

157
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:28,148
That is quite...gleaming.

158
00:11:28,216 --> 00:11:31,018
And so we should explain
our reason for being here.

159
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:32,820
- Piero?
- May I?

160
00:11:34,223 --> 00:11:38,460
The two Papal states flank
your land and mine

161
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:41,897
and while we can watch
Rome with one eye...

162
00:11:41,964 --> 00:11:46,168
..we must always keep
another...eye,

163
00:11:46,236 --> 00:11:49,973
always on the Pope's property,
to the north.

164
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,107
Unless...

165
00:11:52,242 --> 00:11:57,213
..the northern realm
became our property.

166
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,914
And how would that happen?

167
00:11:58,982 --> 00:12:02,852
Well,
if we allied ourselves -

168
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:06,122
Florence and Urbino -

169
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:11,227
it'd make sense if we could carve up the
northern Papal territory between us.

170
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:13,730
I can annexe the city of Bologna
and its environs.

171
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:16,900
You could double your port
capacity on the Adriatic.

172
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:20,203
A bold stroke, but why don't I
conquer it myself?

173
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:23,674
I have the army.
What do you offer up?

174
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:26,577
Money, of course,

175
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:30,048
from the largest banking concern
in all of Europe.

176
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:33,084
From each of us,
as he is...

177
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,719
..blessed.

178
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,692
Scared you,
didn't I?

179
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,262
That'll be fine, Medici.

180
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:46,297
I shouldn't provoke
my own godson,

181
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,433
but I like to test
a man.

182
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,802
You've grown to be
a worthy ally.

183
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,438
And it's been too long since
I led my men into combat.

184
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,073
Our proposal is timely, indeed.

185
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,142
I knew you had something
juicy in mind,

186
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,810
when you showed up on
my doorstep.

187
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,880
There's no way you'd caravan
all this distance

188
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,450
just to watch me take a shit.

189
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,524
Their turbans are nailed
to their skulls.

190
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:16,595
All Turkish. Clearly this
warlord has an issue with the Ottomans.

191
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:20,966
His bravery against the
Turks won him 13 years in prison.

192
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:24,970
But, seeing as none of us
are Turks ourselves,

193
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:28,374
we should have
nothing to fear.

194
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:30,410
You don't think,
with my blood,

195
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,778
someone could take me
for a Turk?

196
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,080
How do I know this warlord's
eyes aren't failing?

197
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:38,518
Because I spotted you
from miles away.

198
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,220
Though I were blind,
I could hear the clattering

199
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:44,156
and nattering of your Tartar
tongue from further yet.

200
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:47,827
- I'm not a Tartar.
- What are you, then?

201
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,462
- Unique.
- Unique?

202
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,398
Dung beetles think
they're unique.

203
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:56,402
Your mongrel half-breed lineage
speaks louder than your words.

204
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:02,142
You see God, well, has many
punishments for mankind:

205
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,846
earthquakes, volcanoes,
plagues and cancers.

206
00:14:05,914 --> 00:14:09,083
Worse than these, he sent
the Turks and the Tartars

207
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,818
and the mongrels,
like you.

208
00:14:23,732 --> 00:14:25,533
Ave,
Vladislaus Dracul Filius,

209
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:29,004
vaivoda partium
Transalpinarum.

210
00:14:29,072 --> 00:14:31,173
Prince of Transylvania
and Wallachia,

211
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:33,909
son of Vlad II known as Vlad
Dracul, or Vlad the Dragon,

212
00:14:33,977 --> 00:14:37,079
which makes you Vlad III,
Son of the Dragon.

213
00:14:37,147 --> 00:14:41,717
Or as it is known in
your language: Dracula.

214
00:14:41,785 --> 00:14:45,154
Impressive,
your command of my titles,

215
00:14:45,222 --> 00:14:48,325
but tell me who you are
and what you want here.

216
00:14:48,392 --> 00:14:50,326
My name is Maestro Leonardo.

217
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:53,863
These are my companions,
Nico, Zoroaster.

218
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:56,699
We were sent by the
Magnificent Lorenzo de Medici

219
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,835
of the Republic of Florence.

220
00:14:58,902 --> 00:15:02,405
All of Italy wonders at your
victories against the Ottomans,

221
00:15:02,472 --> 00:15:04,273
and my lord extends
his friendship

222
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:06,976
and seeks military counsel
for the greater glory

223
00:15:07,043 --> 00:15:08,778
of Florence
and Wallachia.

224
00:15:10,814 --> 00:15:14,282
You must know this land
has been bedeviled by war,

225
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,317
and worse than war.

226
00:15:18,888 --> 00:15:21,656
We shall talk more...

227
00:15:22,725 --> 00:15:24,959
..at dinner.

228
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:27,228
As long as
the dinner's not us.

229
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,735
So we're selling tickets to
the Papal baths now, are we?

230
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:37,839
An urgent matter has arisen.

231
00:15:37,906 --> 00:15:42,144
Urgent enough that you sully
this chamber with her presence?

232
00:15:42,211 --> 00:15:44,746
I know where to find
whores if I want them.

233
00:15:44,814 --> 00:15:47,982
We thought it best you hear this
news directly from her lips.

234
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:54,422
I've come from Florence,
Your Holiness.

235
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:58,360
And does your absence
from the city...

236
00:15:58,427 --> 00:16:00,062
..create no suspicion?

237
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:02,797
My aunt in Siena is
providing me with an alibi.

238
00:16:02,865 --> 00:16:05,800
No-one of import will
miss me in Florence.

239
00:16:05,868 --> 00:16:09,203
Certainly your husband doesn't
fall into the category of import.

240
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:13,174
What of
Lorenzo's war engineer,

241
00:16:13,242 --> 00:16:16,845
in whom the Count seems
so fascinated?

242
00:16:16,912 --> 00:16:18,814
Da Vinci has set out
from the city.

243
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:21,950
No man knows where.

244
00:16:22,018 --> 00:16:23,486
Nor woman?

245
00:16:23,554 --> 00:16:25,555
Nor I.

246
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,560
Lorenzo himself
has left Florence.

247
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:32,262
As we speak,

248
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,631
he makes an embassy to
the Duke of Urbino,

249
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:36,634
fresh with the credit
of his dealings

250
00:16:36,701 --> 00:16:39,269
with Ferdinand and Isabella.

251
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:42,973
He seeks to create
a new military alliance.

252
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,709
The calculating rogue.

253
00:16:45,777 --> 00:16:49,146
Far from reeling at our attempts
to weaken his rule,

254
00:16:49,213 --> 00:16:52,048
Lorenzo courts the most
accomplished mercenaries

255
00:16:52,116 --> 00:16:53,149
on the peninsula.

256
00:16:53,217 --> 00:16:55,752
I know what
the naval do with them.

257
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,121
He and Urbino
will march north.

258
00:16:58,189 --> 00:17:01,792
Together, they'll sack our lands
surrounding Bologna

259
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:03,560
and divide them up.

260
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:05,061
How do you know, Holy Father?

261
00:17:05,129 --> 00:17:08,532
Because it's exactly what
I'd do, you fucking coward.

262
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:11,369
Look at the lot of you.

263
00:17:11,436 --> 00:17:14,038
Too scared to bring me
this news yourselves.

264
00:17:14,106 --> 00:17:18,642
Hiding behind
this Florentine slit.

265
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:22,246
How can I wonder Lorenzo
resists me so well,

266
00:17:22,314 --> 00:17:24,782
when I see
the quality of my allies?

267
00:17:26,552 --> 00:17:29,721
We only tried
to serve your glory.

268
00:17:29,788 --> 00:17:33,491
We had not the benefit
of your divine guidance.

269
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:35,693
Guidance? You want guidance?

270
00:17:37,563 --> 00:17:40,532
Do you remember what proved
I was chosen by God?

271
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:43,501
So... So many things,
Your Holiness.

272
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:50,475
The way I survived
drowning as a child.

273
00:17:50,543 --> 00:17:52,110
Let's see how you do.

274
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:08,860
Holy Father, surely...
a loving God shows mercy.

275
00:18:08,928 --> 00:18:10,429
You dare question me?

276
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:14,233
The rock upon which
God's word stands.

277
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,968
Kiss this ring.

278
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:32,350
My bath is ruined.

279
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:37,788
I don't care how,
end the house of Medici,

280
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:39,323
before I end you.

281
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:51,435
Dinner awaits.

282
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:57,241
How are we supposed to free the
captive from a place like this?

283
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:59,076
If I knew that,
I'd be Da Vinci.

284
00:19:02,514 --> 00:19:04,515
You've dropped some change.

285
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,685
Of course, you'll have
noticed the money.

286
00:19:07,753 --> 00:19:12,391
The Sultanis -
a base currency...

287
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:14,893
..for the heathen ruler
of the east.

288
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:17,896
You see, this is how
I allow my soldiers

289
00:19:17,964 --> 00:19:20,099
to prove
their loyalty to me.

290
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:24,003
I toss these Sultanis on
the ground before them.

291
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,640
And, do you know, the coins are
never, ever touched?

292
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:30,542
It's just they've fallen
quite randomly,

293
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,244
you'd really notice
if one was gone?

294
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,185
I miss nothing.

295
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,224
Please, now.

296
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:47,961
A little Tuscan wine,

297
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:49,830
just to make you feel
at home, no?

298
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:53,334
Thank you. Thank you.

299
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,069
I must say, I'm impressed with
your hospitality,

300
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:59,673
so soon after your escape
from captivity.

301
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,608
I am, sadly, at home
in dungeons.

302
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:05,112
As a child, my father sent
my brother and me

303
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,950
to be hostages held by
the Turkish Sultan.

304
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:13,721
The prisons converted
my damnable brother

305
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:17,591
to the cause of the Turks,
but not me.

306
00:20:17,658 --> 00:20:19,125
I learned to trust nobody.

307
00:20:19,193 --> 00:20:21,360
To survive any pain,
the dogs, the dungeons,

308
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,995
even a lightning strike,

309
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:27,332
which has left me with
this...web of scars.

310
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:37,708
Now I spend every waking hour
in resistance to my brother...

311
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:43,247
..and the fucking Turks.

312
00:20:47,085 --> 00:20:50,622
Well your victories against them
have been recognized,

313
00:20:50,689 --> 00:20:52,690
even by the Pope.

314
00:20:55,027 --> 00:20:56,761
If we're going to raise
a toast,

315
00:20:56,829 --> 00:21:00,031
let's lift a glass to the one who
helped me out of the prison this time,

316
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:01,866
to the Bringer
of Light himself.

317
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:04,702
Who, my lord?

318
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:09,440
Lucifer,
the Bringer of Light.

319
00:21:09,507 --> 00:21:11,575
Most beautiful
of all the angels.

320
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:15,512
And how did Lucifer
help you?

321
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:19,883
Like me, Lucifer rose
against a tyrant.

322
00:21:19,951 --> 00:21:25,322
Like me, he was abandoned and
betrayed by the God he loved.

323
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:28,758
I made a pact with Lucifer
to win my freedom

324
00:21:28,826 --> 00:21:33,497
and ascend to my throne
one last time.

325
00:21:33,565 --> 00:21:37,434
And, do you know...?

326
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:41,672
I don't find it hard
to live without a soul.

327
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:49,145
Lucifer.

328
00:21:53,517 --> 00:21:55,085
And how fortuitous for
Da Vinci.

329
00:21:55,153 --> 00:21:59,490
The clever devil leaves just as
I arrive with questions.

330
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:01,192
You don't find
that curious?

331
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:05,463
Trust me, signor, that's the
least curious thing about him.

332
00:22:07,165 --> 00:22:08,799
What is your relationship
with him?

333
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:11,535
We had our day...

334
00:22:11,603 --> 00:22:14,939
..but that's all it was,
a day.

335
00:22:15,007 --> 00:22:17,943
And, anyway,
his eye is set on another.

336
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,780
- How do you know?
- I'm a woman.

337
00:22:21,848 --> 00:22:24,350
No, of course
we're friends.

338
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:29,521
He saved my life and, for that,
I deeply admire him.

339
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:31,424
That hasn't become illegal,
has it?

340
00:22:31,491 --> 00:22:33,059
It has if it hurts Florence.

341
00:22:33,126 --> 00:22:34,894
All I want is
your help in guarding her.

342
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:37,730
I don't know where he's gone.

343
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:39,565
You keep
his confidences well.

344
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:43,002
I'd like to lie
to anyone else, Excellency,

345
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:45,570
but not you.

346
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:52,278
Although, if you tried
to force it out of me,

347
00:22:52,346 --> 00:22:55,181
I'd be helpless
to stop you.

348
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,986
Perhaps we should discuss
this somewhere else.

349
00:23:00,053 --> 00:23:02,689
- Somewhere more quiet?
- Mm.

350
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,724
Until we make it less so.

351
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,466
The city gates are closed.

352
00:23:13,534 --> 00:23:17,570
Two minutes to curfew,
scoundrel.

353
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:20,139
Either you get your arses home
or spend the night here.

354
00:23:20,207 --> 00:23:23,809
Persons caught roaming the streets after
curfew get put in my little book.

355
00:23:23,877 --> 00:23:28,081
Being put in my little book means you
explain your transgressions to the judge.

356
00:23:28,148 --> 00:23:30,483
Signor Medici,
forgive me.

357
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:32,351
I hadn't seen you with
a bar wench.

358
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:35,388
- Your little book?
- My ledger, full of pigs, mostly.

359
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,423
You record every curfew
violation?

360
00:23:37,491 --> 00:23:38,991
Since the day
it was declared.

361
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,494
If one were to study these,
one might see who was out,

362
00:23:41,562 --> 00:23:42,996
when they shouldn't
have been?

363
00:23:43,063 --> 00:23:45,564
Yes, if one were
a glutton for punishment.

364
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,300
Take me to them.

365
00:23:47,368 --> 00:23:49,736
One could speak weeks paging
through these records.

366
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:53,740
Then we're in luck. According to my
brother, I'm great at wasting time.

367
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,583
Your secret, sir?

368
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,887
Oh, it's a matter of knowing
which elements to blend.

369
00:24:06,954 --> 00:24:10,090
Magnesium here,
iron filings there, so on.

370
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:11,558
I think it's ingenious.

371
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:14,795
Does it have
a military application?

372
00:24:14,863 --> 00:24:16,864
Not yet.

373
00:24:16,932 --> 00:24:18,599
Well, then,
we must talk further.

374
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:21,035
Since I've renounced
your Christian gods,

375
00:24:21,103 --> 00:24:23,705
I've only my wits and
ferocity to protect me

376
00:24:23,773 --> 00:24:26,608
from the forces
of Sultan Mehmed II.

377
00:24:27,944 --> 00:24:30,712
Perhaps the ingenuity you bring
to Lorenzo's court

378
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,514
could benefit me as well.

379
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,485
Now...

380
00:24:38,021 --> 00:24:40,923
..since you've shown me
your little party piece,

381
00:24:40,991 --> 00:24:45,794
I will respond in kind with
a little diversion of my own.

382
00:24:45,862 --> 00:24:49,397
You see, without a
soul weighing me down,

383
00:24:49,465 --> 00:24:51,766
I can see in the dark.

384
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:54,970
I cannot be killed.

385
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:58,239
I can enjoy certain
entertainments

386
00:24:58,307 --> 00:25:01,109
that may have made me
blanch years ago.

387
00:25:03,913 --> 00:25:08,317
This is the last of the retinue
of a Turkish ambassador

388
00:25:08,384 --> 00:25:11,853
who was foolish enough to
approach me.

389
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:17,560
I miss no opportunity in
reminding the Turks

390
00:25:17,628 --> 00:25:19,962
of the childhood
they provided.

391
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,331
Is it the one
we're looking for?

392
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:25,935
Unshackle him.

393
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:41,917
Now...prove stronger
than your friends.

394
00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:44,654
Defeat these dogs
and you will go free.

395
00:25:46,857 --> 00:25:48,758
And please don't think
me so inhuman

396
00:25:48,826 --> 00:25:50,760
that I wouldn't give you
a fighting chance.

397
00:25:51,662 --> 00:25:53,096
Here's a butter knife.

398
00:26:11,815 --> 00:26:13,582
Please! Don't!

399
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,522
This...

400
00:26:21,224 --> 00:26:22,725
This is justice.

401
00:26:25,162 --> 00:26:28,831
So...shall we send
for the main course?

402
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:31,968
I can't eat.

403
00:26:32,035 --> 00:26:34,737
My tastes are not universally
shared, it's true.

404
00:26:34,805 --> 00:26:37,807
- Let us retire.
- Before we do...

405
00:26:41,512 --> 00:26:47,083
You have honored us with the
traditional wine of our homeland,

406
00:26:47,151 --> 00:26:52,555
and so do we honor you, with the
traditional liquor of Wallachia.

407
00:26:52,623 --> 00:26:56,459
- You've brought Tuica?
- Mm-hm.

408
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:59,528
Well, our master in Florence
would spare no expense

409
00:26:59,596 --> 00:27:02,966
to demonstrate his admiration
for you, my lord.

410
00:27:09,873 --> 00:27:11,640
To Vlad III.

411
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:22,986
When have I ever known you to
hesitate about a drink, my friend?

412
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,724
To Vlad III.

413
00:27:31,862 --> 00:27:33,496
To Vlad III.

414
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:38,101
Good.

415
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:39,836
And some for your maid?
Your men?

416
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,938
- Yes.
- Yes? Good.

417
00:27:42,006 --> 00:27:44,374
There you go.

418
00:27:46,344 --> 00:27:49,679
Some for you...
Some for you.

419
00:27:49,747 --> 00:27:52,849
Show the friends to a room.

420
00:27:52,917 --> 00:27:56,286
- Some for you.
- Once my guards have toasted our guests,

421
00:27:56,354 --> 00:27:58,388
the artisan and I
will parley further.

422
00:27:58,456 --> 00:28:04,528
How about your dogs, who entertained
us so well, this evening?

423
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:08,732
There's some for you, for you,
the last little drop.

424
00:28:15,073 --> 00:28:17,374
Please don't be unsettled
by the vermin.

425
00:28:17,442 --> 00:28:20,211
I welcome them.

426
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:23,013
Often, in prison,
they were my only friends.

427
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:27,452
Well, I know what it is
to be thrown into a cell.

428
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:29,888
Without the companionship
of the bats,

429
00:28:29,955 --> 00:28:32,924
I would not
have survived.

430
00:28:32,992 --> 00:28:35,960
You see.

431
00:28:36,028 --> 00:28:41,699
- We understand each other.
- Hmm.

432
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:43,401
Come.

433
00:28:49,908 --> 00:28:52,377
Beautiful, is it not?

434
00:28:56,315 --> 00:29:01,719
You see, this is why I wanted to
return to Castle Poenari so badly.

435
00:29:01,787 --> 00:29:03,421
From the heights...

436
00:29:05,724 --> 00:29:09,961
..I can almost forget
the decades the Turks

437
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:11,929
have been living
underneath the earth.

438
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:16,199
It's a shame, then,
that was the last of them.

439
00:29:16,267 --> 00:29:20,237
Oh, there is one more.

440
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:26,710
Their master, Solomon Ogbai.

441
00:29:26,778 --> 00:29:28,579
The name Ogbai,

442
00:29:28,646 --> 00:29:32,382
in Amharic, it means:
don't take him away.

443
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,084
Yeah?

444
00:29:36,954 --> 00:29:39,288
Indeed.

445
00:29:41,058 --> 00:29:42,625
For stooping to serve them,

446
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:47,362
I take my time with
the Abyssinian.

447
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:52,668
I keep him ready for
my personal whims.

448
00:29:52,736 --> 00:29:56,071
I invent new ways to torture,
just for him.

449
00:29:56,139 --> 00:29:59,341
There is a window,
near where I keep him.

450
00:29:59,409 --> 00:30:01,543
He cannot see the view.

451
00:30:01,611 --> 00:30:06,682
So I said I would recreate
the scenery for him...

452
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:11,287
..if he would only
provide me with

453
00:30:11,355 --> 00:30:15,392
the raw material
for a suitable miniature.

454
00:30:17,628 --> 00:30:24,300
These are the crenulations of
the towers outside my window...

455
00:30:24,368 --> 00:30:28,204
..carved in
the Abyssinian's own flesh.

456
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:36,179
There is one frontier he shall
never stop exploring.

457
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:38,414
Agony.

458
00:30:41,184 --> 00:30:45,387
May I share a confession
with you?

459
00:30:45,454 --> 00:30:48,823
Yeah, yes...

460
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:51,593
..if it pleases, my lord.

461
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,328
I know...

462
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:56,864
..that I'm mad.

463
00:30:56,932 --> 00:31:00,268
Indeed?

464
00:31:00,336 --> 00:31:04,272
But will you tell me how
I could be otherwise?

465
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,142
A father rips a child
from his home,

466
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:08,743
from everything he knows

467
00:31:08,811 --> 00:31:11,747
and tosses him into the claws
of his worst enemy.

468
00:31:14,183 --> 00:31:15,884
Well, we are...

469
00:31:15,952 --> 00:31:20,021
We are too often
what our fathers make us.

470
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:22,723
Whether we like it or not,
better or for worse.

471
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,625
Oh, yes.

472
00:31:25,693 --> 00:31:29,029
In my case,
definitely for worse.

473
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:32,999
You see, my father,
he taught me

474
00:31:33,067 --> 00:31:36,769
that cruelty is the only true
currency of the universe,

475
00:31:36,837 --> 00:31:40,739
and now I am the richest man
in all of Christendom.

476
00:31:40,807 --> 00:31:42,642
Ha!

477
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:42,434
- My God, it is true.
- Yes?

478
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:45,871
Servants told me you were carrying
books upon books into your quarters.

479
00:32:45,938 --> 00:32:48,707
I wondered if they'd been
raiding the wine cellar.

480
00:32:48,775 --> 00:32:51,009
- I'm easy to tease.
- Only sometimes.

481
00:32:51,077 --> 00:32:53,245
Well, at least you have
a hobby you love.

482
00:32:53,312 --> 00:32:55,714
And what is your new hobby?

483
00:32:55,781 --> 00:32:58,650
The Florentine obsession with
record keeping is paying off.

484
00:32:58,718 --> 00:33:01,620
These are the records to every guard
at every station in the city.

485
00:33:01,687 --> 00:33:04,923
Anyone who breaks curfew
will be put down here.

486
00:33:04,991 --> 00:33:07,092
Including, I suppose,
the true spy,

487
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,794
whom you believe
framed Becchi.

488
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,464
You smirk, but there are
mysteries to be solved here.

489
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:15,001
For example, why do these symbols
from the zodiac keep coming up?

490
00:33:15,069 --> 00:33:17,404
This. That's the sign for
Capricorn, I think.

491
00:33:17,471 --> 00:33:19,072
And this, that's Aquarius, yes?

492
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,608
With certain sensitive
subjects of Florence,

493
00:33:21,676 --> 00:33:23,477
their names are indicated
with symbols,

494
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:26,379
rather than list them clearly as
violators of the curfew.

495
00:33:26,447 --> 00:33:29,249
Ah. This date I recall.

496
00:33:29,317 --> 00:33:32,820
After a long night of carousing,
I was questioned on my way home,

497
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:34,989
so is this the symbol for me?

498
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:36,724
Athletic champion
that you are,

499
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:39,193
Sagittarius is
a natural code name for you.

500
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,562
Tell us the identity behind each
of these symbols, then.

501
00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:43,196
I'm not privy to
that knowledge.

502
00:33:43,264 --> 00:33:46,433
- That's in Captain Dragonetti's office.
- Obtain it for me.

503
00:33:50,037 --> 00:33:52,238
Becchi would be proud of you.

504
00:34:02,182 --> 00:34:05,984
The man we're here to save must
be dead by now.

505
00:34:06,052 --> 00:34:09,388
No. No, not yet.

506
00:34:10,823 --> 00:34:15,160
But...but we must move
to save him now.

507
00:34:16,496 --> 00:34:18,030
You two can go on.

508
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:21,658
I feel like I could sleep
for the next week.

509
00:34:21,683 --> 00:34:22,734
As could I.

510
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:26,271
That's because
we've all been poisoned.

511
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:28,040
What?

512
00:34:31,711 --> 00:34:33,345
Drink some antidote.

513
00:34:33,413 --> 00:34:35,781
That bastard.

514
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:41,254
- He slipped something in our drinks.
- No.

515
00:34:41,322 --> 00:34:43,724
I did.

516
00:34:46,761 --> 00:34:50,565
There's nothing you won't do to
us in your bloody quest.

517
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:58,406
I... I adulterated the Tuica
before we arrived.

518
00:35:01,677 --> 00:35:07,582
That we'd all have to drink it, in
order to convince him it was safe.

519
00:35:13,756 --> 00:35:16,759
And now...

520
00:35:16,826 --> 00:35:22,131
..everyone, including the dogs,
should be passing out.

521
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:29,239
Ready?

522
00:35:37,182 --> 00:35:39,083
How do you know where
we're going?

523
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:41,485
It's a simple
architectural assessment.

524
00:35:43,889 --> 00:35:48,393
The Abyssinian pointed it
out to me himself, in a way.

525
00:35:49,862 --> 00:35:51,562
Do we wanna know
what you mean?

526
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:55,199
No, actually, you don't.

527
00:35:56,602 --> 00:35:59,504
It's here.

528
00:35:59,572 --> 00:36:03,341
Are you sure about this,
Maestro?

529
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:04,943
No.

530
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,360
What does that say?

531
00:36:59,932 --> 00:37:01,499
Don't take me away.

532
00:37:04,937 --> 00:37:08,606
Now, this, this is justice.

533
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:11,976
To Vlad III.

534
00:37:14,613 --> 00:37:17,782
Farewell greetings from
a half-breed mongrel.

535
00:37:26,726 --> 00:37:29,294
Nico...

536
00:37:29,362 --> 00:37:32,330
..go get the horses.
I'll meet you outside.

537
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,121
Ah. That one.

538
00:38:40,466 --> 00:38:42,000
Careful. Careful. Careful.

539
00:38:54,247 --> 00:38:55,981
It's that one, then that one.

540
00:39:03,923 --> 00:39:05,957
Not too fast,
he'll be cut even deeper.

541
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:11,996
It's all over. It's OK.
It's over.

542
00:39:12,064 --> 00:39:14,799
It's not. It's not.

543
00:39:16,502 --> 00:39:18,703
It's not him.

544
00:39:27,412 --> 00:39:29,046
It's not Vlad.

545
00:39:29,114 --> 00:39:30,481
Shit.

546
00:39:36,855 --> 00:39:38,556
Fuck me.

547
00:39:57,372 --> 00:39:59,343
You're an arrogant
little fool, aren't you?

548
00:39:59,344 --> 00:40:02,646
I've endured every drug
and poison known to man.

549
00:40:02,714 --> 00:40:04,948
I fought off
the Ottoman empire.

550
00:40:05,016 --> 00:40:07,317
Do you really think that
I would die at the hands

551
00:40:07,384 --> 00:40:10,687
of a fucking Florentine?

552
00:40:16,193 --> 00:40:19,228
Shit.

553
00:40:21,865 --> 00:40:23,332
Or a mongrel?

554
00:40:28,272 --> 00:40:30,140
How's that for
a military application?

555
00:40:34,178 --> 00:40:36,914
Zo, wake up!

556
00:40:36,982 --> 00:40:38,382
Wake up! Zo!

557
00:40:50,596 --> 00:40:52,230
Life...

558
00:40:52,298 --> 00:40:55,201
Life is a trap,
don't you think?

559
00:40:55,268 --> 00:40:57,269
Well, now,
I'm going to set you free.

560
00:41:05,012 --> 00:41:06,146
Curious.

561
00:41:13,187 --> 00:41:16,255
You cannot kill
a man without a soul.

562
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,635
You must go.

563
00:41:29,703 --> 00:41:32,404
Do not shirk from the task.

564
00:41:39,746 --> 00:41:43,281
Stay out of Florence
for the next few days.

565
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:47,452
Oh, and don't speak with
Lorenzo, or anyone in the city.

566
00:41:49,655 --> 00:41:52,891
I suppose
I could go to Siena...

567
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:57,362
..and create a story to explain
my extended absence, but why?

568
00:41:59,498 --> 00:42:01,066
You've seen what happens,

569
00:42:01,134 --> 00:42:04,704
when people question the plans
of the Vatican, haven't you?

570
00:42:04,771 --> 00:42:06,939
I have.

571
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:11,578
Speak to nobody
along the road.

572
00:42:11,646 --> 00:42:14,882
And make sure
no-one speaks with you.

573
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,650
That shouldn't
be a problem.

574
00:42:16,718 --> 00:42:19,820
I have a strategy.

575
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:29,030
- Have some men follow her.
- Of course.

576
00:42:29,098 --> 00:42:31,299
Then discreetly
have her killed.

577
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:35,269
Her value to us
has been exhausted.

578
00:42:35,337 --> 00:42:38,172
She's...

579
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,343
..compromised by
her affections for Da Vinci.

580
00:42:42,411 --> 00:42:48,116
Did His Holiness
order this?

581
00:42:48,184 --> 00:42:51,419
Do it outside
the walls of Florence.

582
00:42:51,487 --> 00:42:53,121
Leave no ties to Rome.

583
00:42:53,188 --> 00:42:56,124
Make it look like
bandits did it.

584
00:42:58,261 --> 00:43:03,933
Oh, and er...have them drive
stakes through her eyes.

585
00:43:06,036 --> 00:43:08,538
She's seen too much.

586
00:43:18,482 --> 00:43:21,284
The guards, the dogs,
they're gonna rouse soon.

587
00:43:24,689 --> 00:43:26,322
Where did you get that wound?

588
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,892
There are more urgent
things to explain.

589
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,594
- Did you know this would happen?
- I knew it might.

590
00:43:31,662 --> 00:43:34,497
I had to take that chance,
for the Book of Leaves.

591
00:43:34,565 --> 00:43:36,966
Sword.

592
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:40,169
Maestro, shall we see to
his injuries?

593
00:43:41,871 --> 00:43:44,706
They're beyond seeing to and I
cannot meet my end here.

594
00:43:44,773 --> 00:43:46,808
In other words,
fuck this place.

595
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:48,743
I want to spit on
Vlad's body.

596
00:43:50,445 --> 00:43:52,612
Yeah. Well, you could if
we knew where it was.

597
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,548
Where the fuck is he?

598
00:43:54,615 --> 00:43:56,250
Just come on! Let's go!

599
00:43:56,317 --> 00:43:58,052
Maybe some creature
dragged him off.

600
00:43:58,119 --> 00:43:59,920
Let's not find out. Come on.

601
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:15,537
You really must try this,
Camilla.

602
00:44:15,605 --> 00:44:17,873
Surely you have a sweeter
tooth than your brother.

603
00:44:17,941 --> 00:44:19,708
You certainly have
a sweeter smile.

604
00:44:19,776 --> 00:44:22,211
Some honey.

605
00:44:22,279 --> 00:44:26,548
The pride
of the Duchy of Urbino.

606
00:44:26,616 --> 00:44:29,284
Oh, I've made arrangements
with their Duke.

607
00:44:30,987 --> 00:44:34,089
With brawn like his, I pity those
who wish harm upon Florence.

608
00:44:34,157 --> 00:44:36,458
You'll have your hands
full with that one.

609
00:44:36,526 --> 00:44:40,562
Federico da Montefeltro's
a...colorful character indeed.

610
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:44,196
Did you invite us here to show
off your new alliance?

611
00:44:44,221 --> 00:44:44,933
Bernardo!

612
00:44:44,934 --> 00:44:48,202
I don't recall inviting you at
all, Signor Baroncelli.

613
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:54,475
Perhaps you fail to understand
why I went to Urbino.

614
00:44:54,542 --> 00:44:56,844
You think Rome will
look after the Pazzis

615
00:44:56,911 --> 00:44:58,712
but, when all is said
and done,

616
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,882
Rome only looks after Rome.

617
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:08,754
And you - both of you -
are loyal sons of Florence.

618
00:45:12,259 --> 00:45:17,496
Don't you think the time has come
for union in our republic...

619
00:45:17,564 --> 00:45:19,531
..not further divisions?

620
00:45:22,436 --> 00:45:26,405
My brother Giuliano has
a stubborn mind,

621
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,407
but a good heart.

622
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:32,278
At one point, we hoped to
see him in a Cardinal's hat,

623
00:45:32,346 --> 00:45:37,150
but our current relations with
the church have precluded that.

624
00:45:37,218 --> 00:45:42,289
And yet, a young man like
Giuliano, needs a future.

625
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,563
He would make a fine husband
for Camilla...

626
00:45:48,631 --> 00:45:50,431
..would he not?

627
00:45:52,701 --> 00:45:53,935
Honey, anyone?

628
00:45:57,407 --> 00:46:00,142
Farewell.

629
00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:01,276
Arrivederci.

630
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,782
Whether or not the Pazzis agree
to this union, I have to ask,

631
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:11,552
did you consult your
brother about this?

632
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:16,157
Giuliano's interests are
the interests of Florence.

633
00:46:16,224 --> 00:46:19,694
I'll have breakable objects removed from
the room before I broach the topic.

634
00:46:19,761 --> 00:46:22,663
She is the child of
our enemy, signor.

635
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:26,400
Some might argue he is being
thrown to the wolves.

636
00:46:26,468 --> 00:46:29,569
You underestimate
my brother, Piero.

637
00:46:29,637 --> 00:46:32,873
We are not feeding
these wolves.

638
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:35,109
We are taming them.

639
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,985
Did you know he was
going to propose this?

640
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,755
I had an inkling...

641
00:46:48,823 --> 00:46:51,224
..seeing as it was my idea.

642
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,501
- You've had your elixir?
- Relax.

643
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:07,206
They say children conceived in
frustration are born bitter.

644
00:47:07,273 --> 00:47:12,111
You'll understand I'm agitated by
this league of devils around us.

645
00:47:12,178 --> 00:47:13,879
After our ploy with
the Pazzis,

646
00:47:13,947 --> 00:47:16,749
you're not ready for
another master stroke.

647
00:47:19,052 --> 00:47:25,258
Our doctor said this position is more
likely to conceive us a male heir.

648
00:47:25,326 --> 00:47:28,228
Men would prefer a position
where a woman's face

649
00:47:28,295 --> 00:47:30,530
is rammed down so far
she can't even speak.

650
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:32,632
I'm sorry, what was that, dear?

651
00:47:33,834 --> 00:47:35,135
Please.

652
00:47:59,928 --> 00:48:02,163
Wooo!

653
00:48:49,646 --> 00:48:52,281
It was the cage.

654
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:55,985
It was the cage.
It was the cage.

655
00:48:56,053 --> 00:48:59,488
The words written on the side:
don't take him away.

656
00:48:59,556 --> 00:49:02,925
It wasn't a taunt,
it was a warning.

657
00:49:04,628 --> 00:49:08,264
Vlad built the device to eviscerate
you if you were freed...

658
00:49:09,166 --> 00:49:11,934
..to rip
an unstanchable wound.

659
00:49:12,002 --> 00:49:15,037
I should've realized.

660
00:49:15,105 --> 00:49:17,506
- I'm sorry.
- Never mind.

661
00:49:17,574 --> 00:49:21,176
I must tell you
of the key you seek.

662
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:28,050
The other key that opens
the Vault of Heaven?

663
00:49:28,118 --> 00:49:29,752
Yes, tell me.

664
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:34,623
It's waiting in Rome,
there for your taking.

665
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:39,095
And, when you have
both keys...

666
00:49:39,162 --> 00:49:43,532
..your mother,
Caterina

667
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,402
she is alive.

668
00:49:48,271 --> 00:49:52,008
She carries
the Book of Leaves for us,

669
00:49:52,075 --> 00:49:58,013
beneath the post of the sun
in a town made of stone...

670
00:49:58,081 --> 00:50:00,849
..in a land on my map.

671
00:50:02,151 --> 00:50:05,588
Why...I need you
to decode the map.

672
00:50:06,956 --> 00:50:10,091
Then you may take
what you need.

673
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:12,358
Here.

674
00:50:14,263 --> 00:50:20,034
Here is the secret
to deciphering the map.

675
00:50:21,637 --> 00:50:24,505
I will not survive
to come with you.

676
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:30,244
You must cut my flesh loose
and take it with you...

677
00:50:31,913 --> 00:50:33,213
..once I die.

678
00:50:37,086 --> 00:50:39,254
The Turk said that
I would save you.

679
00:50:39,321 --> 00:50:42,624
And so you will...

680
00:50:42,691 --> 00:50:45,327
..someday...

681
00:50:45,394 --> 00:50:47,762
..but not today.

682
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,703
But there are so many things
you must learn first.

683
00:50:55,771 --> 00:50:57,605
Yes? Yes?

684
00:50:57,672 --> 00:51:03,477
You must learn
that anything is possible...

685
00:51:03,545 --> 00:51:06,714
..including defeat.

686
00:51:08,283 --> 00:51:13,153
- You must...learn...
- What? What?

687
00:51:18,293 --> 00:51:21,428
What?

688
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:23,464
- What? What?
- Maestro...

689
00:51:23,531 --> 00:51:26,099
- I must - must learn what?
- Maestro, he's gone.

690
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,968
- Maestro.
- I must learn what?

691
00:51:28,035 --> 00:51:30,804
I must learn...

692
00:51:30,872 --> 00:51:33,607
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

693
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:36,744
Fuck! Fuck.

694
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,824
I've been here before.

695
00:51:49,892 --> 00:51:52,961
- No, this isn't the path we came in on.
- No. No.

696
00:51:54,765 --> 00:51:58,834
This is where the Abyssinian
and I first met.

697
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:02,971
He warned me...

698
00:52:09,745 --> 00:52:13,081
I thought
I could solve things...

699
00:52:13,148 --> 00:52:15,350
..like I always do.

700
00:52:27,662 --> 00:52:31,164
Hell happens...

701
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:34,834
..when the evil of the world
exceeds our belief

702
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:37,384
that we can conquer it.

703
