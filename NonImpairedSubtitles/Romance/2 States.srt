1
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,371
Doctor...

2
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:17,605
The internet has confused
me with too many options

3
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,209
That's why I'm here.

4
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,046
I need some help.

5
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,314
I...

6
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,184
I want to kill myself.

7
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,617
Suicide.

8
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,155
I haven't showered in a week...

9
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,568
nor have I spoken to anyone.

10
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:41,198
Even my ceiling fan
stopped responding.

11
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:45,238
Maybe I'm going insane.

12
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,502
Slightly, but...

13
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,546
The homes and hearts of you...

14
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,725
South Indians are the same...

15
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,616
completely hollow.

16
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,006
How can I forget...

17
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:20,301
I've replayed that day
in my mind a thousand times.

18
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,503
And what is this
supposed to be?

19
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,512
Sam bar.

20
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,310
- This?!
- Yes.

21
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,179
Ls there a problem?

22
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,181
Just one problem.
You!

23
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,153
If you have a problem,
keep moving.

24
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,248
Excuse me!
You're cutting the line.

25
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,259
How will he eat if
he doesn't cut the line?!

26
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,035
I've been the 'Head Cook'
here for 10 years!

27
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,031
Not a single 'complan'
against my sambar!

28
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,632
There hasn't been a single 'complan',
that's why no improvement!

29
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,430
Can anyone eat this?!

30
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,226
No...

31
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,098
But you'll get used
to it in a while.

32
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,641
The rasgulla's not bad.
Try it.

33
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,438
Give me the rasgulla.

34
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:57,640
Finish your food first.

35
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,775
Who do you think you are?

36
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,174
Give it to me!

37
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,281
One more.

38
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,115
One rasgulla per student.

39
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:08,751
Very good.

40
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,052
What's edible,
one per student...

41
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,619
miserable sambar unlimited!

42
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,164
Give her mine...

43
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,591
Please.

44
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,035
Please.

45
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,012
Where did this stupid
idiot come from?

46
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,618
Teaching ME about sambar.

47
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,051
Hi...

48
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,390
I'm Krish.

49
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,459
Ananya.

50
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,396
Are you eating the mess
food for the first time?

51
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,070
Yes.

52
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,429
And this sambar is awful.

53
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,176
I'm very hungry.

54
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,571
Let's go out and eat.

55
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,181
Class is in an hour!

56
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,080
So?

57
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:18,421
Half a tandoori chicken,
one roomali roti...

58
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,158
Aren't you a South Indian?

59
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,323
Tarn I I ian.

60
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,461
And...

61
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,159
Do you have beer?

62
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,266
Gujarat is a dry state.

63
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,395
Why?

64
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,168
Gandhiji was born here.

65
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,105
And...

66
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,007
he was against beer?

67
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,249
So... coming back
to my question.

68
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,583
What's the difference between
South Indians and Tamilians?

69
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,551
H uge difference.

70
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:44,383
Thank you.

71
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,789
For example, Tamil Brahmins
don't eat non-vegetarian...

72
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,388
I'm from a pure,
Brahmin household.

73
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,760
I can see that.

74
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,365
And you?

75
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,026
I'm a Punjabi.

76
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:00,332
We can't digest our
chicken without alcohol.

77
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,438
I hope you're not from ll‘l'.

78
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,573
LlT Delhi.

79
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,080
Why?

80
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,476
Nothing!

81
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,076
Why...
ls that a problem?

82
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,021
Not yet...

83
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,622
Excuse me?

84
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,254
Don't you think llT
boys are a little weird?

85
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,728
Meaning?

86
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,231
I mean...

87
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:31,268
In one week, I've received
10 proposals from llTians...

88
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,462
for marriage!

89
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,529
One even brought me
his grandmother's bangle!

90
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:40,569
And you think today
will be your 11th?

91
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,610
No...

92
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,409
- That's not what I meant!
- Then what did you mean?

93
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,079
Forget it.

94
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,421
Just because a few boys hit
on you, you've lost your head?

95
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,184
No, nothing like that.

96
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,588
I'm sitting here, aren't I?

97
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,648
Oh... wow! Thanks!

98
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,658
I'm leaving.

99
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,120
Here's my share...
Bye.

100
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,995
I'm sorry! Sorry!

101
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,270
Look...

102
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:15,207
I don't have any
friends here...

103
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,140
You're the only
one who seemed safe.

104
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,149
For once...

105
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,718
someone wasn't hitting on me!

106
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:23,714
You know what I mean, right?

107
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,288
Wrong.

108
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,447
I mean...

109
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,550
Why wouldn't I hit on her?

110
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:33,589
I'm a young,
red-blooded Punjabi.

111
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,201
So what if I'm
average-looking?

112
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,997
I was a man, after all.

113
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,263
I mean... I am.

114
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,033
Rs. 120 each.

115
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,443
So... we're good, right?

116
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:10,594
Settle down, everyone...

117
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,158
Settle down!

118
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,129
How many Economics
graduates here?

119
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,732
Yes... Ms. Swam I nathan.

120
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,408
Do you recognize the curve?

121
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,171
The basic marginal
utility curve, sir.

122
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,978
Yes! And how do you represent
that curve mathematically?

123
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,052
Um...

124
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,751
Sir, the curve shows
different bundles of goods...

125
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,219
Tell me the
mathematical formula.

126
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,429
I don't know, sir.

127
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,489
Notice, class...

128
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,695
This is the state of Economics
education in this country.

129
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:50,229
A top graduate doesn't
know the mathematical formula.

130
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,702
You.

131
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,169
The basic marginal utility of
a particular consumer...

132
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,338
can be mathematically...

133
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,473
explained as MU= DUIDQ,

134
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:03,280
where DU represents change in utility
and DQ represents change in quantity...

135
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,386
Ananya!

136
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,691
Forget it!

137
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,325
These things happen.

138
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,728
Do you want to see
how many medals I have?

139
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,660
I stood third in my university!

140
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,038
But now this Chatterjee
is going to fail me!

141
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:24,199
I'm sure all the professors will
be laughing at me in the staffroom!

142
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,264
Relax.

143
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,503
In a couple of years you'll
be earning four times their salary.

144
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,639
And they'll be giving the same
lecture to the next batch!

145
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,478
Then you can smile.

146
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:33,676
Okay?

147
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,485
I've never been so insulted!

148
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,249
Then don't raise
your hand in class.

149
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,189
If you want...
I can help you with economics.

150
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,426
I'm just asking;
this isn't the 11th proposal.

151
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,601
I was a topper in Eco...

152
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,571
Sorry but you're an engineer.

153
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,039
How can you help me?

154
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:57,733
Correct.

155
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,105
Bye.

156
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,437
Krish!

157
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,014
Okay, done.
8 0' clock? My room.

158
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,477
And by the way...
the score is now 22.

159
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,538
Wow, you're taking
this really seriously!

160
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,310
Come.

161
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:58,431
My mother.

162
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,595
She's a singer!

163
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,139
Tried to get me to sing, too...

164
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,594
That's why I ran
away and came here!

165
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,774
What's your story?

166
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,035
I don't have a story.

167
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,511
Are you an orphan?

168
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,080
No...

169
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,514
Well then,
what does your dad do?

170
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:15,711
Shall we start?

171
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,679
If you don't want to tell me,
just say so.

172
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:33,592
Dad...

173
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,239
Retired Army Officer.

174
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,137
And?

175
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,099
Do you want to fail?

176
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,146
Why are you so grumpy?

177
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,118
Here.

178
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,517
What does he have that I don't?

179
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,118
Luck, bro. Luck!

180
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,369
2 minutes...
Need to make a call.

181
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,509
Kavita, phone!

182
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:20,777
Kavi.

183
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,388
Hello?

184
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,327
Hello?

185
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,230
Hello?!

186
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,055
Hello?

187
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,286
How many times have I told you?
Stay by the phone after 10!

188
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,023
It's 11! And anyway...

189
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:10,727
Shipra told me cell phone
vibrations cause hean attacks!

190
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,536
How hard is it
to say hello to him?

191
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,095
You're too stubborn.

192
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,468
So are you.

193
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,200
Forget it.

194
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,603
How are you?

195
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,408
I'm fine...

196
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,074
Have they started serving
chicken there?!

197
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:29,279
No! When we want non-veg,
we go out and eat.

198
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,554
I still don't understand...

199
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,353
Why did you leave
home and become vegetarian?!

200
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:39,257
Listen! Have you
made any friends there?

201
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:40,656
Yes!

202
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:41,789
Uh...

203
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,391
Punjabi?!

204
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:44,559
No!

205
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,526
Well...

206
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,296
never mind.

207
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,701
You know how
broad-minded we are!

208
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:52,708
Of course.

209
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:56,269
Okay, mom,
I have a test tomorrow so...

210
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,507
I'll hang up now.

211
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,740
Okay, bye.

212
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,248
You don't talk to your father?

213
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,025
Why?

214
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,727
Long story.

215
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,665
So?

216
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,628
So... not today.

217
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,764
What do your parents expect?
After graduation?

218
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,768
I don't know.

219
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,272
I just want to
earn a lot of money.

220
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,208
And then?

221
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,015
Then...

222
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,085
Then l...

223
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,314
actually want to be a writer.

224
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,413
Really?

225
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,254
What will you write?

226
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,321
Haven't thought about it...

227
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,732
Simple things...

228
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,566
Stories about people like us...

229
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,034
I don't want to preach...

230
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,165
I just want to write good,
honest stories.

231
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:02,035
Whether the story
has a hero or not...

232
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,408
the story should be the hero.

233
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,583
I'm talking nonsense, right?

234
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,449
Not really...

235
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,283
And you?

236
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,253
Mom thinks I can't
do anything...

237
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,493
but most likely
a Marketing job.

238
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,529
For now, I just need
to get good grades.

239
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,191
Ohhh...

240
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,997
So that's why you
made friends with me!

241
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,240
Control yourself...

242
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,774
You're not that
much of a genius.

243
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,371
Okay...

244
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,076
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

245
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:43,575
Krish!

246
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,479
Your theory...

247
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,295
The "Honest Story",
the "Hero" one...

248
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,289
It's very good.

249
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,327
I mean it!

250
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,326
Bye.

251
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,968
Maybe she was
interested in me...

252
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:13,641
Now... Instead of being happy,
I panicked.

253
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,313
I started behaving
like an idiot.

254
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,620
Krish!

255
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,187
B Plus.

256
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,361
Your shuns are rather short.

257
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,694
What did you get?

258
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:31,628
A minus.

259
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,600
How?!

260
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,466
I am a gold medalist
in Economics!

261
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,471
Do one thing....

262
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,474
Go show your medal
to Professor Chatterjee.

263
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,210
What's wrong with you?

264
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,473
Nothing.
What could be wrong?

265
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,375
Okay, come on, let's go out.

266
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,776
I owe you a treat!

267
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:47,678
Dressed like that?

268
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,480
Yes!

269
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,382
Why?

270
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,452
Are you feeling shy?

271
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,082
Aren't you?!
People are staring!

272
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,319
These guys will
stare no matter what I wear!

273
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,593
So you want to excite
people around here?!

274
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,724
I don't want to excite anybody!

275
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,660
You llTians are
excited enough already!

276
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,671
Looking at me obviously
excites you more...

277
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,230
but I really can't
do anything about it.

278
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,437
Krish!!!

279
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,474
Are you serious?! You're
really not coming with me?

280
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:50,537
"My naive, simple
heart was fine by itself"

281
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:55,140
"And then you came along
and turned it on its head"

282
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,379
"l was falling
in love with you"

283
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,647
"But you said
we're just friends"

284
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,691
"Desire coursed through me"

285
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,993
"But I could do nothing..."

286
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,619
"I can't escape"

287
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,256
"Love is snapping at my heels"

288
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,229
"ls this a comedy?"

289
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,535
"Or a tragedy?"

290
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:17,599
"Never wanted it,
now I'm stuck with it"

291
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:21,135
"I'm confuzzled in love!"

292
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:32,245
"I'm confuzzled in love!"

293
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,622
"What an absurd state I'm in"

294
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,133
"What is this mood God is in?"

295
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:48,735
"Why does he gamble
away my heart?"

296
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:53,204
"This pretense of friendship
feels like monotony"

297
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:58,041
"And I play at it, even
though my heart's not in it"

298
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,326
"l was doing fine by myself"

299
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:15,998
"Now like a dead flower,
I wilt"

300
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:19,395
"Used to be a dependable lad"

301
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:24,303
"Now I'm as useful
as a dried up pen"

302
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:29,139
"l lie awake at night"

303
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:33,148
"You've stolen my sleep"

304
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,113
"And when I do sleep"

305
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,982
"There you are peeping"

306
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:41,081
"From the windows of my dreams"

307
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,591
"So you tell
me-what do I do?'

308
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,423
"I can't escape"

309
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,723
"Love is snapping at my heels"

310
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,027
"ls this a comedy?"

311
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,331
"Or a tragedy?"

312
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:56,534
"Never wanted it,
now I'm stuck with it"

313
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,639
"I'm confuzzled in love!"

314
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,735
I began to have nightmares...

315
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,113
Ananya wanting to
make me her brother.

316
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:07,049
I thought that I should
take care of things...

317
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,779
before they get out of hand.

318
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,684
We have to stop
studying together!

319
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,656
Huh? Suddenly?!
What happened!

320
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,091
It's not you, it's me!

321
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,255
What does "It's not you, it's
me" mean?! Please explain!

322
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,199
Relax!
We're not getting divorced!

323
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,064
We just can't study together!

324
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,226
Krish!

325
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:33,766
"My naive, simple
heart was fine by itself"

326
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:38,378
"And then you came along
and turned it on its head"

327
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:43,175
Want to go to
Rambhai's after class?

328
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,509
No.

329
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,117
I have to study.

330
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,256
Are you both fighting?

331
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,120
Mind your own business!

332
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,062
"Never wanted it,
now I'm stuck with it"

333
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:03,699
"I'm confuzzled in love!"

334
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,655
Krish sir! Can you
spare 5 minutes, please?

335
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,229
What is this childish
behaviour, Krish?

336
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:34,169
Do you think your grades
will improve by ignoring me?

337
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,603
Nothing like that.

338
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,040
Krish! Eye contact!

339
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:43,705
I can't do this!

340
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,045
I can't keep up this
farce of 'friendship'.

341
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,048
Look, I know...

342
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,413
You're way out of my league.

343
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,282
But I don't want to
be your llT brother, either!

344
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,685
Okay, Krish, just calm down.

345
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:52,721
No!

346
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:55,418
I want you to be my girlfriend.

347
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,221
Surly"-

348
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:04,057
This is why we
shouldn't hang out.

349
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,266
But...

350
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,334
Krish...

351
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,269
I don't have any friends,
besides you...

352
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,432
Same here!

353
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,771
This is torture for me, Ananya!

354
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,569
Firstly, I hate Economics.

355
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,547
Secondly, I'm in love with
the mole on your left cheek.

356
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:22,107
It follows me around and
then I just want to kiss you!

357
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,746
Forget it.
You won't understand.

358
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,118
For you...
this is llT Proposal 55...

359
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:54,480
Sorry!

360
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,314
We were just looking
for our Frisbee.

361
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,218
There's nothing here!

362
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,684
This boy only studies!

363
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,394
Krish!

364
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,593
You're thinking way ahead.

365
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,333
Please stop!

366
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,668
Not that ahead...
Why should I stop?

367
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,073
Behave yourself.
You're getting nothing.

368
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:23,170
Nothing else or...
not even as much as yesterday?

369
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,011
Do guys only think
about one thing?

370
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,412
Well... yes.

371
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:31,383
We have to finish that
Normal Curve chapter tonight!

372
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,184
Which... curve?

373
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,650
Tell me at least!

374
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,262
Was this your first time?

375
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:45,096
Yeah... with you.

376
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,769
You mean you had
a girlfriend before?

377
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,703
Please take down these photos...

378
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,435
It feels like your parents are
watching us.

379
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:55,443
You never mentioned
this 'girlfriend' before...

380
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,045
Long story...

381
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,274
Oh God, Krish!

382
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,414
You have too many
'long stories'!

383
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,447
Rashmi.

384
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,027
In college.

385
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:12,728
Principal's daughter.

386
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,529
Then what happened?

387
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,029
Then what? I'm here.

388
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,068
She's probably
happily married...

389
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,270
Did you love her?

390
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,169
Sometimes I think that...

391
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,436
If I was a little braver...

392
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,780
Things would have
been different today.

393
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,780
Now, enough.

394
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,385
Last question!
Was she pretty?

395
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:40,512
Not at all!

396
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,559
- Punjabi?
- No...

397
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,253
You know...

398
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,697
My parents are
very conservative.

399
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,257
It's not like we're
getting married!

400
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,161
Right.

401
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:56,372
We're just messing around...

402
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,499
Like...
Friends with Benefits!

403
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,542
Ananya...
That's not what I meant!

404
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,474
Surly"-

405
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:06,242
I'm over-reacting...
Sorry!

406
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,509
Ananya!

407
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,714
Ananya!

408
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,117
- What?
- I love you.

409
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,289
What?!
You don't believe me?

410
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,164
Not at all.

411
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,360
You're just scared I'll
stop sleeping with you.

412
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,560
Well... that too.

413
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,695
No, but, honestly!

414
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,261
We spend all our time together.

415
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:33,104
Even when we're not together,
I only think about you!

416
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,072
It's clear, right?

417
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,475
I love you!

418
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,241
Good.

419
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,647
Now, it sounds convincing.

420
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:45,784
Hey wait! And you?

421
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:49,720
What about me?
I'm just using you for grades!

422
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,253
Oh, really...

423
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,494
Well, use me properly!

424
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:11,480
"My heart is at
odds with my head"

425
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:19,151
"How did love sneak
in and catch us unawares?"

426
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,988
"A little bit of a rascal"

427
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,617
"But kind of helpless, too"

428
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,628
"Love's a devil"

429
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:30,063
"But a lovable devil, it is"

430
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:35,098
"Offo!
Should I chase it away?"

431
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,607
"Offo!
Or should I hold it in embrace?"

432
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:42,372
"Offo!
Should I chase it away?"

433
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,346
"Offo!
Or should I hold it in embrace?"

434
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,142
"Should I wield
it like I'm proud?"

435
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:52,052
"Or slap it away?
Offo!"

436
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,629
"Look here it is...

437
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,262
with pocketfuls of mischief"

438
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,501
"Just like you,
it's quirky too"

439
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:19,138
"It's impulsive,
but it's thoughtful too"

440
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:24,379
"A little decent and
a little shameless too"

441
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:30,386
"Offo!
Should I chase it away?"

442
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:34,086
"Offo!
Or should I hold it in embrace?"

443
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:37,631
"Offo!
Should I chase it away?"

444
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,436
"Offo!
Or should I hold it in embrace?"

445
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,596
"Should I wield
it like I'm proud?"

446
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,075
"Or slap it away?
Offo!"

447
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:09,197
"Crossed every
line of astonishment"

448
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:16,699
"Acting silly when
I'm in my senses, too"

449
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:24,240
"What started as a
joke is now an obsession"

450
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:31,615
"A rather expensive
obsession, too"

451
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:37,018
"Love caresses my shoulders
like it's just a friend"

452
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,458
"But grabs every chance
to show what it really is"

453
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,022
"Past every limit
is this gesture of love"

454
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,000
"Love's a devil"

455
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:50,129
"But a lovable devil, it is"

456
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:55,404
"Offo!
Should I chase it away?"

457
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:59,208
"Offo!
Or should I hold it in embrace?"

458
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,683
"Offo!
Should I chase it away?"

459
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:06,320
"Offo!
Or should I hold it in embrace?"

460
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,355
"Should I wield
it like I'm proud?"

461
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,723
"Or slap it away?
Offo!"

462
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:15,395
"Offo!"

463
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,124
"Offo!"

464
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:22,496
"Offo!"

465
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,701
I just hope to make
some good money...

466
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,671
And then writing?

467
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,208
I don't know what I'll write,
though...

468
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:36,710
Write your tragic
love story with Rashmi!

469
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,587
Not cool, Ananya...

470
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,088
We agreed not to talk about it.

471
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:44,421
I'm serious!
Tragedy's the new cool!

472
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:47,394
The critics will be happy!

473
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,066
Krish...

474
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,125
Hmm.

475
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,402
I love you.

476
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,175
What's gotten into you?

477
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:05,509
Nothing...

478
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,278
I've been thinking about it...

479
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,147
so I said it.

480
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,063
Krish...

481
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,365
are you asleep?

482
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,598
No... say.

483
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:34,300
Placements start in 10 days...

484
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:38,312
Superb, isn't it?
You'll get a great job.

485
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,241
Forget the job, Krish...

486
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,286
In 4 weeks we'll
be in different cities.

487
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,785
So what? I'll just
find a job wherever you are.

488
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,614
That's not in
our control, Krish!

489
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,387
Why are you worried?

490
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:52,792
We'll see where fate takes us...

491
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,052
No!

492
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:55,256
The issue is, where do YOU want...

493
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,561
to take this relationship?

494
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,759
Let's not have this
conversation now. Please, come.

495
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,633
If not now, then when, Krish?

496
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,695
Ananya...

497
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,773
I'm not saying no...

498
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,274
I just need some time.

499
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,612
Weren't 2 years enough, Krish?

500
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:18,083
This is what's
great about you guys.

501
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,519
It takes you no time
tojump into bed...

502
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:24,389
but when it comes to commitment,
you need time to think!

503
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,054
Ananya!

504
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,226
Final question...

505
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,634
Why do you want
to work with our bank?

506
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:08,764
Because, Sir...

507
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:10,700
Your bank is the best.

508
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:15,444
Mr. Malhotra, we want a
candidate with a 7-point grade...

509
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,275
which you don't have.

510
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,712
Nevertheless...
give us 5 minutes?

511
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,802
I felt suffocated.

512
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,304
I couldn't answer the girl
I had loved for two years...

513
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:57,681
And I was waiting for an answer
for a job I didn't care about.

514
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,051
What was I doing?!

515
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,396
And more so, sir...

516
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:13,664
Sunsilk depicts the modern,
confident woman, who no matter what-

517
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,005
Yes?

518
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,575
Sorry, sir.

519
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,609
I have something important
to discuss with her.

520
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:27,308
Her interview is on...
Can't you wait?

521
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,509
No, sir. Sorry.

522
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,311
I only need a minute.

523
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:38,424
How’s the interview going?

524
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:41,464
Krish Malhotra,
this better be important!

525
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,130
Ananya Swaminathan...

526
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:49,371
I've never loved
anyone like this before.

527
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,301
I want to marry you.

528
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,072
MarTY me?

529
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,044
Please?

530
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:05,144
Is everything Okay?

531
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,055
Yes, sir...

532
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,658
Now what?

533
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,126
Now.. say yes?

534
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,431
Yes!

535
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,302
Now go...
or I won't get the job.

536
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,396
Okay! All the best!

537
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,016
Sorry, sir...

538
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,753
So, as I was saying...

539
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,455
Sunsilk...

540
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:47,724
And the confident woman...

541
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,392
Girl...

542
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,566
Why are you wearing slippers?!

543
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:56,264
Forget the slippers... Why
did you bring so many sweets?

544
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,500
Shipra, Guddo, Rajji...

545
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:01,132
everyone wanted to come!
You're the one who told them not to.

546
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,237
They've all sent
boxfuls of love to you!

547
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,442
And why have you
become so thin?

548
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,049
Mom... Come on. Let's go.

549
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:15,353
This was bound to happen... Who can
survive only on vegetarian food?!

550
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,326
- Vastrapur road, please.
- Hold this.

551
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:23,559
Mom...

552
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,999
I want you to meet someone.

553
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,161
Who?

554
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,298
A girl.

555
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,471
A Girl?

556
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,733
Are you in relationship?!

557
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,739
No, mom...
She's just a very good friend.

558
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,480
Friends are always very good.

559
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,346
If they were bad,
they wouldn't be our friends.

560
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,117
Her name is Ananya...

561
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,450
She's got a great
marketing job with Sunsilk!

562
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:50,583
Really! Sunsilk shampoo! Can
she send us half a dozen cartons?

563
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:56,154
Mom, please don't talk like a middle
class woman. You will embarrass me.

564
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,767
Stop the rickshaw!
Turn it around! Turn!

565
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:04,473
I was foolishly excited to
come for your conversation!

566
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:11,310
Slogged like a donkey to
find all these sweets for you!

567
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:16,475
Why did I come if all I do is embarrass
you in front of your friends?!

568
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,277
Girls only cause
fights at home.

569
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,414
See? He's absolutely right!

570
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,356
You please just drive ahead.

571
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,188
Mom...

572
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,089
Listen to me...

573
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:34,230
That's not what I meant...

574
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:41,168
I've told Ananya so many stories
about you, she's dying to meet you!

575
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,135
By the way, Krish...

576
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,039
Did you tell her
everything about us?

577
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,548
No...

578
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,752
Just how hard you've
worked to raise me.

579
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,291
And how beautiful you are...

580
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,462
Leave the butter for your food!

581
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:06,561
Listen, sir!

582
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,503
What do Gujaratis
eat for dessert?

583
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,095
Sweet Lentils?

584
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,245
Mom... Ananya.

585
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,149
Hello, Aunty!

586
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,617
Hello...

587
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,584
Krish is always
talking about you!

588
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:36,291
Really? Since I arrived, he's
been talking only about you.

589
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:37,365
Shall we sit, Mom?

590
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,422
Here?

591
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,330
Ananya... Where's Aunty?

592
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:43,304
She's on her way... You know how
long she takes to wear her sari!

593
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,738
Oh, yes...

594
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:48,637
Since when do you know
so much about saris?

595
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:54,538
Oh!

596
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:01,248
Oh God! They're Madrasis!

597
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:03,350
Tarn I I ian.

598
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,621
Same thing.

599
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,493
Okay, mom. Come quickly!

600
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,463
Mum... Dad... This is Krish.

601
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,299
And his mom.

602
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,738
<i>[Man] u.</i>

603
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:28,345
I'm so happy we're
all together.

604
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,188
Where's Krish's father?

605
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:37,215
He has a heart problem.
He can't travel.

606
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,185
Oh.

607
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,066
Okay.

608
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:46,463
I'll see you.

609
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,111
What kind of father misses
his own son's convocation?

610
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,272
Let it go, Radha.

611
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,073
- They let Madrasis study here?
- Mom!

612
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:06,687
I have to go join the line.
Please talk to them.

613
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:10,218
In which language?
I don't speak Madrasi.

614
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,361
We are all going for
lunch together tomorrow

615
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:16,091
You can go if you want to.
I'll eat alone.

616
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:23,604
So...

617
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:26,232
Aunty... How does it feel?
Are you excited?

618
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:30,507
Yes... but this is what
we expected from Ananya!

619
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:32,308
Oh. good.

620
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,542
Uncle...

621
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,749
How long are you staying?

622
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:43,516
Two days.

623
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:45,085
Why?

624
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:47,387
I was thinking...

625
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:49,620
we could hire a car
and go sight seeing tomorrow?

626
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,721
No.

627
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:53,568
We can go see Gandhi Ashram?

628
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:56,161
Yes! Very good idea, Aunty!
Gandhi Ashram! Done!

629
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,501
Okay, Mom? Gandhi Ashram!

630
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:00,599
What's there in Gandhi Ashram?!
I don't want to go.

631
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,303
Typical Punjabi.

632
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:07,315
All money, no class.
Uncultured people.

633
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,673
Uncultured and us?!

634
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,179
These Madrasis are
the uncultured ones!

635
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,382
What?!
What did you say?

636
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:17,426
Nothing, Aunty!
Mom, please, control!

637
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:21,224
Control? These Madrasis
should control their daughters!

638
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:23,264
Look at all the
Madrasi heroines...

639
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,267
each one has trapped
a Punjabi boy!

640
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:28,132
Control!
Why should I control?

641
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,198
Come on, let's go! Come on!!!

642
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:33,602
What happened?

643
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:44,416
I'm telling the truth!

644
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,214
Krish! Let's go!

645
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:59,635
Thank Goodness you didn't
touch their feet instead!

646
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,343
Krish!

647
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,449
Love you!

648
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:24,492
That day,
I watched my mother graduate.

649
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,057
She was so happy...

650
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,762
She forgot all her problems...

651
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:35,703
But by then, Ananya's
parents had a problem.

652
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,414
What are you staring
at that for? Just write Delhi.

653
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:57,459
There's no need
to go anywhere else.

654
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:01,062
I had a few days off
before the job started...

655
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:02,995
so I went home.

656
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:05,291
Things were tense...

657
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:10,030
Neither mom nor Ananya's
family had forgotten the fight.

658
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:12,333
Hi!

659
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,565
Phone sex?

660
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,609
What?!

661
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:20,410
Today's my first day at Sunsilk!
It's a great office...

662
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,382
I'm very excited!

663
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,016
You're applying
to Chennai... right?

664
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:29,249
Mom wants me to
stay in Delhi...

665
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:32,551
You know I'd come there
if I had an option...

666
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,755
Please come! I miss you!

667
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,593
I'll figure it out.

668
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:37,598
Good.

669
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:38,656
I love you.

670
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:40,261
Hmm.

671
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:41,765
No.

672
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,664
You have to say it.

673
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,598
Mom's watching...

674
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,370
Hard luck. Say it.

675
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:52,741
I...

676
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:55,774
love...

677
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,718
you...

678
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:59,116
Zing! This new app.

679
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:02,053
I'll message you the name.
Download it.

680
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:06,490
Very bad, Krish! Please think
of something better next time!

681
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,192
Okay. Bye.

682
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:15,394
Ananya! What did he say?

683
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:16,631
Nothing.

684
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,400
Beware of that Madrasan.

685
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,107
They're experts
at brainwashing boys!

686
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,668
Mom, her name is Ananya.

687
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:25,342
And I love her.

688
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:27,382
She's making a fool of you!

689
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,282
She's successful, has a good job.
Why would she fool me?

690
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:31,752
Look. We Punjabis are...

691
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,511
fair and good looking.

692
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,454
And these Madrasis... Dark.

693
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,388
They're jealous of us!

694
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:41,428
Have you seen Ananya?
She's fairer than me!

695
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:45,431
These fair skinned Madrasans
are even more dangerous!

696
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:46,797
What nonsense!

697
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,469
Sorry, Mom! Sorry!

698
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,732
Today, it's just my finger...

699
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,706
it's going to
be my throat tomorrow!

700
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,266
Okay, Mom... relax.

701
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:57,539
I'll apply to Delhi.

702
00:43:58,202 --> 00:43:59,772
- Promise?
- Promise.

703
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:01,678
Happy?

704
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:04,279
Now, where are the band-aids?

705
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:05,715
There.

706
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:09,983
Writer?!

707
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:14,357
So, you're going to wander around
in your khadi kurta, with a ratty bag?

708
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:17,729
It's that Madrasan's doing.
She's going to ruin your life!

709
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:20,695
Tell him! He shouldn't
repeat your mistakes!

710
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:24,199
What did you gain from this love
marriage? Besides fighting?

711
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:27,641
We'll find a nice, educated
girl for Krish... Right?

712
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:30,338
I already found a nice,
educated girl, Mom.

713
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,108
But she's a Madrasan!

714
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,239
- So?
- So?!

715
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:37,615
What if tomorrow you want to marry an
Assamese or Oriya girl? Unacceptable!

716
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:40,483
Great. He's here.

717
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,726
Hello, brother-in-law.

718
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:54,632
I said hello, brother-in-law.

719
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:56,769
What are you doing here?

720
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,598
What do you mean?
My sister invited me.

721
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:04,372
Great. One wretch has come to cry
over the wretchedness of another.

722
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:12,709
I haven't come her to be humiliated!
I don't know how you stand it!

723
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,079
This is the limit.

724
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:16,585
Look, son.

725
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:19,024
You should meet Dolly...

726
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,263
She's a nice girl for you.

727
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,123
Look at them.

728
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:27,158
Even the greatest
love fades over time.

729
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:28,559
Okay.

730
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:31,299
Be well. Take care.

731
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:34,471
Who's Dolly?

732
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:37,576
Who is Dolly?

733
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,042
- ls he looking for girls?
- Yes.

734
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,209
Why wasn't I told?

735
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:48,415
What is it to you? Don't
feign interest in our lives.

736
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:50,514
We're not used to it.

737
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:53,591
You and your family
have corrupted his mind!

738
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,028
Not to her, speak to me!

739
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:58,229
Don't even think about it.

740
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,999
Krish, go inside.

741
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,435
Krish, go!

742
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:10,376
First tell him to leave.

743
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:15,173
Krish, go to your room!
Mind the glass...

744
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,219
Just go, Krish!

745
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:42,667
Every time you reconcile,
he acts out again.

746
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,543
Just let the glass be!

747
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,383
It'll cut his feet,
and he'll learn a lesson.

748
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,485
But what if you cut your foot?

749
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:58,151
Why don't you just leave him?

750
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,392
It's not that simple, Krish...

751
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,592
Anyway... -

752
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:06,059
He only comes here to sleep.

753
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:08,332
What difference does it make?

754
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:15,436
Wasn't he going to
open a security firm?

755
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,308
What happened?

756
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:23,073
He punched the only
willing financer.

757
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:29,118
I'm used to him, Krish.

758
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:34,251
But I'm scared
of your temper now.

759
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:39,430
Once your job is fixed,
stay at the company's accommodation.

760
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:41,397
I'll handle things here.

761
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,335
Then why should
I stay in Delhi?

762
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:44,736
- Meaning?
- I mean...

763
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:47,407
I'll earn well,
Mom, let's get out of here!

764
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:50,171
I'm not going to leave Delhi.

765
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:53,076
At least, my relatives
are here.

766
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,612
Mom...

767
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,415
Mom, I want to go to Chennai.

768
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,186
I'm calling Rajji at once...

769
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:14,393
Only a priest can save
my son from that witch now.

770
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,720
<i>- Patti-nakka-pakkam’?
- Paﬁinamwkkam.</i>

771
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:40,450
Yeah! Next to Annai
Velankanni church?

772
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:41,587
Yes yes!

773
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,757
Sorry, I couldn't pick you up.

774
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:48,629
I'm in Vizag for 2 days.

775
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:52,599
By the way... Welcome
to my city, Mr. Malhotra!

776
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:54,470
Thanks for coming.

777
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,133
I've missed you.

778
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,507
Very much.

779
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:04,151
You'll see half of Chennai
on your way to your apartment.

780
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:07,446
No one here knows Hindi,
so don't even try.

781
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:09,285
Use actions.

782
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:11,982
It's the least you can
do for the love of your life!

783
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:16,464
"l found love in you"

784
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:21,526
"And I ran to your city"

785
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,338
"l long to see you"

786
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:28,032
"My heart says your name"

787
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:31,705
"l have come to be one with you"

788
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:35,546
"l long to see you"

789
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:38,243
"My heart says your name"

790
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:43,085
My office is not too
far from your apartment...

791
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:44,623
if you know what I mean.

792
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:47,184
"l found love in you"

793
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:52,165
"And I ran to your city"

794
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,099
Shobha Aunty from
Texas is here.

795
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,505
Dinner at my place day after.

796
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:02,201
Or we won't get to meet.

797
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:03,771
Can't wait to see you!

798
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:09,584
Oh, and mom's having trouble
finding a music teacher...

799
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,719
so she's a little
upset these days.

800
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,450
Also, please don't be late.

801
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,150
You have to impress the in-laws!

802
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:18,619
Love you.

803
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:27,463
Hello, sir.

804
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:29,161
Krish.

805
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:32,698
Ananya's friend...?

806
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,339
Come... come...

807
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:36,810
Take off your shoes!

808
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:40,809
Be careful of the rangoli!

809
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,529
Their house was so quiet...

810
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:01,200
Like we were at a funeral!

811
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,699
Ananya's parents don't
believe in furniture.

812
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,675
Their living room
looked like...

813
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,603
a Punjabi home that was robbed.

814
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:14,649
The robbers didn't like the
sofa, so they left it behind.

815
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:16,743
Sir...

816
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,247
your house is lovely.

817
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:21,380
What lovely?
No running water.

818
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:23,480
Only 3 hours in the morning...

819
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:27,288
Unreliable electricity...
Bloody flies everywhere.

820
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,597
Hello, sir!

821
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,402
That's Radha's music teacher.

822
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:45,146
Radha's busy cooking for you
in the kitchen! What to do...

823
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,377
Wate r?

824
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,517
No! It's okay...

825
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:51,217
Yeah... Actually...

826
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:52,378
Yes or no?

827
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,183
Yes... Yes...

828
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,821
If it's not a problem...

829
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:58,686
Now that you've reached our home...
Why should water be a problem?

830
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,284
Rad ha! VVate r!

831
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,023
Yes, coming!

832
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,327
Hello, aunty.

833
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:11,531
Hello.

834
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,532
Thank you.

835
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:16,669
Sorry forjust
showing up like this...

836
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:18,076
This Ananya, I tell you...

837
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:21,605
Never asks before inviting
people over! Please sit.

838
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:22,706
Yes...

839
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,720
I simply can't understand...

840
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:31,748
why would your bank post
a North Indian in Chennai?

841
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,119
Why?! Bloody, stupid bank.

842
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,491
Uncle, is Ananya home?

843
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:43,636
The look on his face! Like
I was hitting on his wife.

844
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:48,368
What a strange house...

845
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:51,340
then, suddenly
I began to hear sounds.

846
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:59,785
Ah... Carnatic music!

847
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,449
Beautiful, sir...

848
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,355
sorry, guys!

849
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:10,754
- Hi, Ananya.
- Hi.

850
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:17,397
Hi, dad!

851
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,408
Oh, Amma's practicing!

852
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:26,003
Sorry! Mom won the Tamil
Sangam Singing Championship...

853
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:29,381
two years in a row
when Dad was posted in Kolkata!

854
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:30,712
Oh...

855
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:32,747
Sir, you must have
seen a lot of India!

856
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,216
I was not on vacation!

857
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:37,258
I was working,
every single day...

858
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:39,055
Uh... You're right.

859
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:43,564
I got to see a lot of India in
the last 15 years because of the job...

860
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,226
But in the end,
I got stuck in Chennai.

861
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:50,271
Stuck, sir?
Isn't Chennai your hometown?

862
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:55,769
Ananya... Dinner.

863
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,981
- Don't even think about it.
- No one's around!

864
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:05,109
Mom and Dad are right there!

865
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:08,051
By the way, you look
very nice in sari...

866
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:11,287
Thanks.
You look okay, too.

867
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:14,124
You're stuck at this beginner's level!

868
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:17,029
How’ll you ever make
any progress?

869
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,431
You find someone else...
I can't do this.

870
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:25,401
Come!

871
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:29,771
Dad...

872
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,448
He's come half way
across the country.

873
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,541
Please be nice.

874
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:39,718
For me.

875
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,080
Okay?

876
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:45,457
Thank you, Dad...

877
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:51,624
No...

878
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:54,328
That's the plate.

879
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:59,802
I asked Pattama to find a
nice Brahmin boy for Ananya...

880
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,668
But her own daughter
ran away with a foreigner!

881
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,301
Listen to this.

882
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,505
Same story in every house!

883
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:08,014
Could you speak in Hindi?

884
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,376
I don't understand Tamil...

885
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,747
Learn Tamil, then.

886
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,750
Anyway, it doesn't concern you.

887
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,130
- Krish!
- Yes?

888
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:29,568
Let's elope?

889
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,238
Come on!

890
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:34,674
Okay, let's run away!

891
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:36,370
Can you?

892
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:41,307
I can't betray them...

893
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:45,012
I want my parents to be
the happiest when I get married!

894
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:48,282
I know it's hard but
we have to win them over.

895
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:51,522
Do you really want to elope?

896
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:53,150
No.

897
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:57,629
I can't leave mom
alone with dad forever.

898
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:01,658
Anyway... There's no
honour in running away.

899
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:08,467
If we weren't in Mylapore...
I'd have kissed you.

900
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:15,048
- Pattinapakkam?
- Rs. 200.

901
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:16,548
Okay, go.

902
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,179
Krish, I have an idea...

903
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,217
by which you can come
to my house anytime.

904
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:22,119
What?

905
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:24,089
LlT tuitions for my brother.

906
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:26,021
No, Ananya. No. No.

907
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:28,494
Please! Not for free!
Tomorrow onwards 6 o' clock.

908
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:31,031
What <i>6</i> o'clock?!
I work till 7 pm!

909
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:33,397
- Evening is for us to hang out!
- Exactly.

910
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:38,636
- No, Ananya!
- Bye!

911
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:43,708
I love you!

912
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:45,511

"How can it be concealed?"

916
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:04,561
My dear, you are
not perfecting anything!

917
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:08,035
Find someone else to teach you!

Hi!

933
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:08,127

"Spellbound, this mind..."

946
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:06,680
Hello?

947
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:08,081
Hello.

948
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:10,981
How are you?

949
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:13,285
Have you settled in?

950
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,521
Where's mom?

951
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,155
How’s work going?

952
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:17,731
Ls Mom okay or
did something happen?

953
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,095
Your mother is fine.

954
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:21,664
She's at home.

955
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,598
Then why did you call?

956
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,698
What do you mean?

957
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:28,475
To find out if you're okay.

958
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:30,204
Even if I'm not, what is it to you?

959
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:31,677
How shameless you are!

960
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,245
I called to ask how you are...

961
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:36,215
and you're being rude!

962
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:38,274
What have I done
to deserve this, Krish?

963
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:39,518
Krish?

964
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:41,714
Hello!

965
00:59:55,191 --> 01:00:00,402
"Speaks only your name"

966
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:26,358
Thank you, sir.

967
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:28,265
For dropping me.

968
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:32,605
So, how’s work?

969
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:34,198
Okay.

970
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:37,609
Nothing new?

971
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:39,440
Same bank, same job.

972
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:41,378
What could be new?

973
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:55,756
You know how to
make these reports?

974
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,094
Yes! Why?

975
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,792
The new GM...

976
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:02,468
Asked us to do Plug
Point presentations.

977
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:04,095
Power Point, sir. Power Point!

978
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,538
Fool! You idiot! Rascal!

979
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:08,198
Sorry, sir.

980
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:12,240
Not you,
the auto driver is an idiot!

981
01:01:12,301 --> 01:01:13,541
Scoundrel!

982
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:17,584
Sir, if you want...

983
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:22,520
I can help you with
the presentation...

984
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:25,125
No, thank you.

985
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:28,190
You can walk from here.

986
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:35,227
Krish!

987
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:36,292
Yes, sir?

988
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:41,308
You're Ananya's friend... You
tutor my son... Thanks a lot.

989
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:45,245
But you can't marry Ananya.

990
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:46,243
But sir...

991
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:48,780
No! We are simple people.

992
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:50,733
Don't tarnish our
name in the community.

993
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,481
- Sir, just-
- Please.

994
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:17,669
We'll keep trying for a few weeks,
but if your parents don't agree...

995
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,338
Then what, Krish?

996
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:24,041
We'll try something else.

997
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:33,119
Your company's promotional
event is this week, right?

998
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:38,092
S.P. Balasubramaniam and
Shankar Mahadevan are performing.

999
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:40,462
They couldn't find
a third singer.

1000
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:42,467
Can we come?

1001
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:46,233
Of course!
I got passes for you all.

1002
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:49,468
Great! I'm sure
mom will be happy...

1003
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,488
ls he that fellow
everyone is talking about?

1004
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:05,355
Shut up! I'll tell you later...

1005
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,323
He's Manj u's teacher.

1006
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,659
<i>[Man] u!</i>

1007
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,529
Manj u! Teacher!

1008
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:16,466
Listen...

1009
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:18,267
Something special
going on today?

1010
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,274
That's Harish
from San Fransisco.

1011
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:21,637
Harish who?

1012
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:24,768
Ananya and his
stars have matched...

1013
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:28,173
And special food
for special guest.

1014
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:29,675
I‘ m very comfortable.

1015
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:45,062
You start. I'll be back.

1016
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:52,634
Congratulations!

1017
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:55,441
Your groom is waiting
for you with his goggles.

1018
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:58,108
- Krish, I'm sorry...
- That's great.

1019
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,238
Do what you like
and then apologise.

1020
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:04,009
Next time it'll be a wedding
card with an apology. Right?

1021
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,652
Listen! This is only for Shobha Aunty!

1022
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:09,622
Then why are you
wearing such a nice sari?

1023
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:14,220
Thanks.

1024
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:15,694
It's mom's.

1025
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,026
Krish, I love you.

1026
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:19,225
Breathe.

1027
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:23,298
Let's run away.

1028
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:27,507
Can't run in this sari.

1029
01:04:47,183 --> 01:04:48,560
She studied at llM Ahmedabad...

1030
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,529
and now she's working
in sales at Sunsilk.

1031
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:53,199
He asked if I'm a virgin!

1032
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:54,198
Virgin?!

1033
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:57,795
I said only till I turned 18!
The way he ran...

1034
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:00,597
Good! Otherwise I would
have to beat him up.

1035
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:03,204
Your folks hate me...

1036
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:05,172
and now you're leaving.

1037
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:09,239
- What am I going to do?
- Help dad with his presentation!

1038
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:11,080
You'll become friends.

1039
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:12,515
I offered.

1040
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,714
- He threw me out of the car.
- This time he won't.

1041
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:18,220
I'm leaving and
Manju can't do it.

1042
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:19,726
Who else will help him?

1043
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:25,691
Sir!

1044
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:31,666
Ananya was saying...
your presentation isn't ready...

1045
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:35,302
I can help you, if you like...

1046
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:39,613
Why are you being so helpful?

1047
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:43,472
No... ifsjust... Work is
a little light these days...

1048
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:45,712
So, I'm free in the evenings...

1049
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:49,352
And I don't know anyone here,
besides you'll.

1050
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:53,289
I miss my family...

1051
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:07,071
Krish.

1052
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:10,637
If you're free tomorrow
evening... come home.

1053
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:12,735
Thank you, Uncle! I mean...

1054
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:14,340
Okay, sir.

1055
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:22,347
I can't help you.

1056
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:25,117
But, Master, if I practice...

1057
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:48,680
Krish Malhotra.

1058
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:51,416
I know it's meaningless
to talk to you...

1059
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:55,716
But I thought I'd
try one last time.

1060
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:59,151
One day when your
children disrespect you...

1061
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:03,686
You'll understand what I went
through for all these years

1062
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,530
I heard you were at my
house till pretty late last night...

1063
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:08,535
Manju in the morning,
Daddy in the evening...

1064
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:11,231
You should just hire me...
I'll buy the groceries also!

1065
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:14,541
Come soon...

1066
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:18,411
I heard your mother and
her useless sisters talking...

1067
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,981
why you went to Chennai...

1068
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:24,209
It's better if
we find you a girl...

1069
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:33,152
Sir, you already have
two established singers...

1070
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:37,395
I think you should
have one new singer.

1071
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:39,691
Have you heard her sing?

1072
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,535
Yes, sir.

1073
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:43,330
She's very good!

1074
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,070
No...

1075
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:47,538
I can't do it.

1076
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:49,633
I've never sung such songs!

1077
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:52,577
Aunty, you'll be prepared
if you watch the songs on TV!

1078
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:54,376
But... why me?

1079
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:58,551
It's a YES Bank event...
They need a new singer.

1080
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:01,382
And who's better than you?

1081
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:11,096
Sometimes we make
impulsive decisions...

1082
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:14,157
that fill our
whole lives with regret.

1083
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:17,701
This girl may be the
biggest mistake of your life.

1084
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:21,631
U nfonunately, your father.

1085
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,503
Done, sir.

1086
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:27,307
Oh... Good.

1087
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:31,975
So, sir... all set for
your first presentation?

1088
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:35,652
I had to prepare the report...

1089
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,459
Verma will present it.

1090
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:39,492
Why, sir?

1091
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:43,689
Will you have another drink?
Radha's not home today.

1092
01:08:43,752 --> 01:08:46,323
No, sir, I should leave.
Won't be able to get rickshaws later.

1093
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:47,662
Oh just relax. Relax.

1094
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:49,293
Sleep here.

1095
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:50,530
No, Sir. I'll leave...

1096
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:53,199
Relax. One minute...

1097
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,406
One minute.

1098
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:14,459
Wear this to sleep in.
Very comfortable.

1099
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,563
No, sir...

1100
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:21,567
Thank you, sir.

1101
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:25,296
What are you future plans?

1102
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:29,139
Manager at YES Bank?

1103
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:37,377
Actually, sir...
I want to be a writer.

1104
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:40,550
Very good!

1105
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:45,024
Working for yourself...

1106
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:46,726
Very good!

1107
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,560
Otherwise...

1108
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:59,429
you'll be preparing all your
life for others' presentations...

1109
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:02,700
Very good...

1110
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,114
You've really got me in a fix!

1111
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:12,243
Aunty, don't worry!
You're going to be a star.

1112
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:15,653
- Just practice.
- No... I can't do it!

1113
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:18,590
Aunty, you'll be very good!
I promise.

1114
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:20,616
Just don't tell anyone.

1115
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:27,226
- Hi, Krish.
- Hello, Uncle.

1116
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:28,529
Hi.

1117
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:30,070
Sorry, Krish.

1118
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:31,263
Mom couldn't come.

1119
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:33,637
She needed to urgently
go to her friend's house.

1120
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:35,642
- Very sorry.
- It's okay.

1121
01:10:37,099 --> 01:10:38,737
Uncle, can I get you a drink?

1122
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:40,409
I don't drink!

1123
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:53,183
"The waves of music are rising"

1124
01:10:55,117 --> 01:11:00,533
"Desire is lingering in my mind"

1125
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:07,268
"My heart yearns
to see you my dear!"

1126
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:13,604
I was mesmerised by your words"

1127
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:17,746
"l hesitated to come close to you"

1128
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:23,480
"l longed for you to
come near and embrace me!"

1129
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:29,257
"You made a place in my heart"

1130
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:33,230
"You stole my mind."

1131
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:41,422
"You gave me boundless joy,
oh my life!"

1132
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:47,647
"Oh my dear, what have you done?"

1133
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:53,379
"Oh my love, what have you done?"

1134
01:11:54,643 --> 01:12:00,457
"Don't you know I've
been waiting for you?"

1135
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:06,157
"Don't love me so..."

1136
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:09,735
"Don't love me so..."

1137
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:16,339
"Oh, howl love you"

1138
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:21,342
I was mesmerised by your words"

1139
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:25,317
"l hesitated to come close to you"

1140
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:31,083
"l longed for you to
come near and embrace me!"

1141
01:12:32,581 --> 01:12:40,581
"My heart yearns to
hear it time and again!"

1142
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:44,595
"Say it's love..."

1143
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:48,374
"Say it's love..."

1144
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:53,041
"Yes, I love you!"

1145
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:56,274
"Oh yes, I love you!"

1146
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:15,062
And then Verma said...

1147
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:19,038
"How did you do it?!" And I said,
"What? I know PowerPoint!"

1148
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:25,010
- Aunty, any singing offers?
- No, no!

1149
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,670
But I'm going to start
Contemporary singing classes now...

1150
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:38,250
Uncle...

1151
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,457
Aunty... Manj u.

1152
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:44,394
I have something to say.

1153
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:48,297
I came to Chennai
<i>6</i> months ago...

1154
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:51,497
But I've been in love
with Ananya for 3 years.

1155
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:54,632
And she loves me too...

1156
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:56,438
I think.

1157
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:05,117
We thought love is
enough to get married...

1158
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:08,547
so we introduced you all
at the convocation.

1159
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:11,450
But that's when we realized...

1160
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:14,989
the journey from
love to marriage...

1161
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:17,595
isn't easy.

1162
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:21,692
We could have easily eloped...

1163
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:27,039
But Ananya wanted
you all at her wedding...

1164
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,572
And happy-

1165
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:31,204
Happier than her!

1166
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:35,511
I know...

1167
01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:41,181
I'm no Harish.

1168
01:14:43,545 --> 01:14:46,151
But please, don't hate me.

1169
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:52,089
For our happiness...

1170
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:54,459
accept me.

1171
01:14:58,260 --> 01:14:59,637
Please.

1172
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,411
I, Krish Malhotra...

1173
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,412
hereby ask you all to marry me.

1174
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,021
Nice.

1175
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:28,997
Will you keep
my daughter happy?

1176
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:30,726
Very happy-

1177
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:43,517
Our cultures and backgrounds
are very different.

1178
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:45,017
“Horn!

1179
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:56,257
Will your parents
accept my daughter?

1180
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:57,763
I'll try my best.

1181
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:01,598
I promise.

1182
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:28,291
Krish is coming
at the perfect time!

1183
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,693
All those pretty girls
at Minty's wedding...

1184
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,425
he'll forget the Madrasan!

1185
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:34,660
Basically, I just have to agree
with everything your mom says.

1186
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:37,499
Yes! Plus it's
a good time to visit.

1187
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:40,096
My cousin Minty
is getting married.

1188
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,134
Minty!

1189
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,547
You just need to win
over Mom and her family.

1190
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:51,642
Dad won't agree...
but he's a lost cause.

1191
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,087
Ls the flight on time?

1192
01:16:54,142 --> 01:16:56,748
I'm glad this Chennai
nonsense is over.

1193
01:16:57,012 --> 01:17:00,425
Few days being fed at home...
and everything will be okay!

1194
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:04,553
Focus, Ananya.

1195
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:08,293
There's nothing scarier than
a Punjabi mother-in-law.

1196
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:10,500
Can't wait.

1197
01:17:30,295 --> 01:17:32,775
Sorry...
for leaving... suddenly...

1198
01:17:35,166 --> 01:17:40,138
Have you gained some
weight in last four years?

1199
01:17:40,638 --> 01:17:41,708
Sorry!

1200
01:17:43,374 --> 01:17:45,115
I still don't have any friends.

1201
01:17:46,277 --> 01:17:47,381
Anyway... -

1202
01:17:50,148 --> 01:17:51,684
This is my new problem.

1203
01:17:53,351 --> 01:17:55,160
10 publishers have
rejected it already.

1204
01:17:56,154 --> 01:17:58,566
I'm meeting the
11th tomorrow...

1205
01:17:59,123 --> 01:18:00,227
to be rejected again.

1206
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,469
Maybe it was a stupid
mistake to leave the bank...

1207
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:13,572
But I'm no stranger
to stupid mistakes...

1208
01:18:16,241 --> 01:18:17,276
Oh! There he is!

1209
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:19,855
The whole family is here.
Let go of my hand.

1210
01:18:20,311 --> 01:18:22,291
He brought this trouble here?!

1211
01:18:22,714 --> 01:18:25,524
Sister, she's
not pregnant, is she?

1212
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:28,221
I'll kill that Madrasan,
if she is!

1213
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:34,434
How are you? How was
the flight? Have you eaten?

1214
01:18:34,492 --> 01:18:35,732
Mom! Ananya.

1215
01:18:35,793 --> 01:18:38,535
Oh. I'm so happy to see you!

1216
01:18:39,731 --> 01:18:40,801
Hello, Aunty!

1217
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:43,540
Ananya's here for a week!

1218
01:18:45,203 --> 01:18:47,183
- Oh, where will you stay?
- Company's guesthouse!

1219
01:18:47,405 --> 01:18:50,249
Oh, do drop by some time.

1220
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:51,719
- Come on, take your stuff!
- Mom!

1221
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,085
Ananya's accommodation
is from Monday.

1222
01:18:54,279 --> 01:18:56,156
She'll stay at
home for the weekend.

1223
01:18:57,115 --> 01:18:58,116
Whose home?

1224
01:18:59,717 --> 01:19:00,787
Ours?

1225
01:19:05,556 --> 01:19:08,469
Come! Come, get your stuff!

1226
01:19:10,762 --> 01:19:13,800
Isn't Rajji's
son-in-law handsome!

1227
01:19:14,198 --> 01:19:16,144
And such good values!

1228
01:19:16,301 --> 01:19:18,645
Always touches
his elders' feet...

1229
01:19:19,237 --> 01:19:20,443
What's his name?

1230
01:19:20,605 --> 01:19:21,811
Duke.

1231
01:19:22,273 --> 01:19:23,513
- What?!
- Duke!

1232
01:19:23,641 --> 01:19:25,484
What do you mean, Duke?

1233
01:19:25,610 --> 01:19:28,181
He's from London!
So his pet name is Duke.

1234
01:19:28,246 --> 01:19:30,248
How much are they
spending on the wedding?

1235
01:19:30,381 --> 01:19:36,457
25 lakhs! 4 lakhs just on imported
liquor! Plus a car for the boy.

1236
01:19:37,322 --> 01:19:39,632
Don't tell anyone.
It's a surprise.

1237
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:42,764
Anyway, a boy like
that is a dime to a dozen!

1238
01:19:43,127 --> 01:19:44,367
That's true.

1239
01:19:46,264 --> 01:19:49,643
When I asked if Duke
is worth so much...

1240
01:19:50,168 --> 01:19:52,774
how much will Krish
get at his wedding?!

1241
01:19:53,371 --> 01:19:54,645
You know what Rajji said...

1242
01:19:54,806 --> 01:20:00,484
At least a wedding of Rs. 40 lakhs
and gifts worth Rs. 10 lakhs!

1243
01:20:00,745 --> 01:20:02,190
Well, good!

1244
01:20:02,347 --> 01:20:04,520
At least we know
my market value now.

1245
01:20:11,789 --> 01:20:13,132
Aunty...

1246
01:20:13,591 --> 01:20:16,595
You could've sent the driver alone.
You didn't have to trouble yourself.

1247
01:20:18,262 --> 01:20:19,434
It's no problem, son.

1248
01:20:20,365 --> 01:20:21,805
It's not like you came alone,
either.

1249
01:20:34,078 --> 01:20:35,758
Didn't you tell your mom
that I was coming?

1250
01:20:37,115 --> 01:20:38,389
I wanted to surprise her!

1251
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:41,494
There's a big difference
between surprise and shock!

1252
01:20:41,552 --> 01:20:42,656
True.

1253
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:45,090
Anyway, she's out.

1254
01:20:45,323 --> 01:20:46,700
- Can we...
- No chance!

1255
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:48,486
Why are you being
aggressive, dude?

1256
01:20:48,493 --> 01:20:50,700
Just listen to me!
Ananya, relax.

1257
01:20:51,095 --> 01:20:53,405
Morn just talks...
but she's good at heart.

1258
01:20:54,465 --> 01:20:56,306
VVell, Hitler was probably
'good at heart' too.

1259
01:20:57,101 --> 01:20:58,581
You want to take
the next flight back?

1260
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:00,442
Okay. Sorry.

1261
01:21:00,772 --> 01:21:02,183
What do I do?!

1262
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:04,080
Cook!

1263
01:21:04,375 --> 01:21:06,184
You Punjabis are always hungry.

1264
01:21:06,377 --> 01:21:08,118
No! I mean...

1265
01:21:08,146 --> 01:21:10,626
Just help mom with
dinner tonight!

1266
01:21:11,249 --> 01:21:12,489
No, better idea!

1267
01:21:13,418 --> 01:21:18,128
Tell her you'll make dinner tonight!
She'll be so impressed!

1268
01:21:18,189 --> 01:21:19,190
Are you mad?

1269
01:21:19,257 --> 01:21:20,463
I don't know how to cook!

1270
01:21:20,658 --> 01:21:21,693
What?!

1271
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:23,161
What?

1272
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:25,331
Do you know how to cook?

1273
01:21:26,097 --> 01:21:27,371
But I'm a guy...

1274
01:21:28,266 --> 01:21:30,337
And women belong
in the kitchen, right?

1275
01:21:31,035 --> 01:21:32,412
- Right.
- Krish!

1276
01:21:34,272 --> 01:21:35,774
Sorry. I can't do it.

1277
01:21:38,743 --> 01:21:41,189
Remember what you said?
You'll do your best.

1278
01:21:41,446 --> 01:21:42,754
Yes, I remember, but -

1279
01:21:49,754 --> 01:21:51,756
Aunty... can I help?

1280
01:21:52,356 --> 01:21:53,164
No.

1281
01:21:53,224 --> 01:21:55,431
Ananya's a really
good cook, Mom!

1282
01:21:56,494 --> 01:21:57,529
Really?

1283
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:02,736
Here.

1284
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,804
I was thinking we should
have chicken and parathas.

1285
01:22:06,204 --> 01:22:10,550
Maybe some dal...
and raita! Oh, I almost forgot...

1286
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:12,814
- Make some rice, too.
- Mom... mom!

1287
01:22:13,444 --> 01:22:17,586
If you both cook together you'll
get done so much quicker!

1288
01:22:18,382 --> 01:22:21,090
What's the hurry, son?
Take your time.

1289
01:22:21,552 --> 01:22:25,557
Anyway, I'm tired
of eating my own cooking.

1290
01:22:26,057 --> 01:22:29,038
Okay, look.
The flour is under the stove.

1291
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,073
The lentils and spice
powders are in that cabinet.

1292
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:34,037
- Anything else?
- Um...

1293
01:22:34,332 --> 01:22:35,333
Dessert?

1294
01:22:37,068 --> 01:22:39,105
No... not today.

1295
01:22:40,271 --> 01:22:42,273
I'm going to my room...

1296
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:45,216
Call me when the food is ready.

1297
01:22:45,409 --> 01:22:46,513
Okay.

1298
01:22:56,487 --> 01:22:58,160
- Can I help?
- No.

1299
01:23:03,094 --> 01:23:04,129
Did you get hurt?

1300
01:23:04,195 --> 01:23:08,337
I said I would try my best. So what
if I have to shed some blood for it?

1301
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,507
- Young or old...

1302
01:23:11,536 --> 01:23:13,846
All women are
born melodramatic.

1303
01:23:21,012 --> 01:23:22,047
What is that?!

1304
01:23:22,213 --> 01:23:23,385
I don't know.

1305
01:23:23,614 --> 01:23:26,117
- Don't know? It's burnt!
- What's happening here?

1306
01:23:27,618 --> 01:23:29,689
Ls this any way to cook?!

1307
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:32,634
- And what are you doing here?
- Nothing!

1308
01:23:33,157 --> 01:23:34,431
I can see that.

1309
01:23:35,259 --> 01:23:37,796
Wait till you're married,
she'll make you her puppet!

1310
01:23:38,262 --> 01:23:40,037
She doesn't even know
how to make chapatis!

1311
01:23:40,097 --> 01:23:41,633
I don't know anything, Aunty!

1312
01:23:43,034 --> 01:23:45,241
Except how to trap
innocent young boys.

1313
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:47,442
“Horn!

1314
01:23:48,773 --> 01:23:49,808
Ananya...

1315
01:23:50,741 --> 01:23:51,776
Anan...

1316
01:23:52,777 --> 01:23:55,519
Mom, she's trying!
Just give her a chance!

1317
01:23:55,713 --> 01:23:58,421
Why should I?
What is she to me?

1318
01:23:58,683 --> 01:24:00,219
I love her.

1319
01:24:01,052 --> 01:24:02,725
She's really got you bad.

1320
01:24:03,688 --> 01:24:05,690
<i>First, you wasted
my mango juice on her...</i>

1321
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:07,433
now you're fighting with me!

1322
01:24:07,491 --> 01:24:08,595
What are you saying, Mom?!
She'll hear you!

1323
01:24:08,659 --> 01:24:10,832
Then let her hear!
I'm not afraid of anyone!

1324
01:24:27,511 --> 01:24:29,081
I want to go to the guesthouse.

1325
01:24:30,181 --> 01:24:32,457
Ananya, if you act like this,
we don't stand a chance.

1326
01:24:38,289 --> 01:24:40,030
She hates me, Krish.

1327
01:24:41,392 --> 01:24:42,564
Relax.

1328
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,265
You know she doesn't hate you.

1329
01:24:46,030 --> 01:24:48,636
Just give it sometime.

1330
01:24:49,033 --> 01:24:50,341
Everything will be okay.

1331
01:25:02,747 --> 01:25:04,454
Mom...
When is Minty's wedding?

1332
01:25:05,283 --> 01:25:06,557
Next Friday to Sunday.

1333
01:25:07,718 --> 01:25:09,391
- You're coming, right?
- Yes.

1334
01:25:09,654 --> 01:25:11,463
Ananya will come too.

1335
01:25:12,623 --> 01:25:15,797
What am I supposed
to say to who she is?

1336
01:25:16,427 --> 01:25:17,735
My fiancée.

1337
01:25:19,764 --> 01:25:22,005
Mom, please! Let me speak.

1338
01:25:24,502 --> 01:25:30,009
What's the point? If you've
made up your mind, go get married.

1339
01:25:30,241 --> 01:25:32,517
Go right now! I'm sure some
temple will still be open.

1340
01:25:32,576 --> 01:25:34,112
- Mom, just -
- Aunty, please?

1341
01:25:34,578 --> 01:25:36,558
We want you to happily agree.

1342
01:25:36,781 --> 01:25:38,226
We don't want to force you.

1343
01:25:39,083 --> 01:25:40,426
But you are forcing me!

1344
01:25:41,786 --> 01:25:43,788
I worked hard to raise him.

1345
01:25:44,655 --> 01:25:46,191
I have some expectations, too.

1346
01:25:46,357 --> 01:25:49,031
I want my in-laws
to respect me.

1347
01:25:49,327 --> 01:25:53,400
My family and I will find
a very nice girl for Krish.

1348
01:25:53,464 --> 01:25:55,569
Why do you think
they won't like her?!

1349
01:25:55,633 --> 01:25:59,274
- Because she's not Punjabi?
- Just let Ananya meet them once!

1350
01:25:59,804 --> 01:26:01,078
Look, Krish.

1351
01:26:01,138 --> 01:26:04,415
I've been taunted my whole
life because of your father.

1352
01:26:04,542 --> 01:26:06,544
I can't take any
more because of you.

1353
01:26:06,610 --> 01:26:09,591
Nothing like that will happen.
I promise.

1354
01:26:18,255 --> 01:26:19,632
Aunty, I'm sorry...

1355
01:26:20,558 --> 01:26:23,129
for just showing up like this.

1356
01:26:23,661 --> 01:26:25,072
It's not your fault.

1357
01:26:26,063 --> 01:26:29,237
Krish is the one who
never tells me anything.

1358
01:26:30,568 --> 01:26:31,603
Yes, Aunty.

1359
01:26:32,103 --> 01:26:34,276
His communication
skills are a little weak...

1360
01:26:34,739 --> 01:26:37,720
Not a little...
They're very weak.

1361
01:26:42,179 --> 01:26:43,590
Where's Uncle?

1362
01:26:45,349 --> 01:26:46,589
I don't know.

1363
01:26:47,251 --> 01:26:49,060
I'll know if he
bothers to return.

1364
01:27:13,577 --> 01:27:14,749
Good morning, Uncle.

1365
01:27:23,087 --> 01:27:24,225
I'm Ananya.

1366
01:27:25,089 --> 01:27:26,261
Krish's friend.

1367
01:27:29,293 --> 01:27:31,534
Hurry up or we'll
get stuck in traffic.

1368
01:27:31,595 --> 01:27:32,801
Where are you going?

1369
01:27:34,465 --> 01:27:35,739
I'll get the bag.

1370
01:27:40,337 --> 01:27:43,318
Tell your shameless son
to show some respect or I'll...

1371
01:27:43,374 --> 01:27:44,819
- What happened?
- What do you mean what happened?!

1372
01:27:45,176 --> 01:27:46,519
Who's this girl?!

1373
01:27:47,077 --> 01:27:48,818
- She's his friend.
- This is normal for this house.

1374
01:27:49,079 --> 01:27:50,786
- His friend?!
- Sorry...

1375
01:27:50,815 --> 01:27:52,317
- What is she doing
in our house?!

1376
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:55,759
It's not your fault. Let's go.

1377
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:57,822
- He's going to drop
her to guesthouse now.

1378
01:27:58,088 --> 01:28:00,591
I didn't know she was coming. I was
going to tell you in the morning...

1379
01:28:00,658 --> 01:28:03,639
Morning?!
When will your morning begin?

1380
01:28:04,161 --> 01:28:07,142
Please, Vikram...
It's too early to fight...

1381
01:28:10,768 --> 01:28:12,372
Why were we doing this?

1382
01:28:13,404 --> 01:28:14,883
Pretending to
be a normal family?

1383
01:28:19,710 --> 01:28:21,212
I missed Chennai...

1384
01:28:24,715 --> 01:28:26,388
Why had I brought Ananya here?

1385
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:30,797
I was misleading the poor girl.

1386
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:38,070
Why didn't she just leave me?

1387
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:04,128
Dad...

1388
01:29:05,189 --> 01:29:06,691
I wanted to talk to you...

1389
01:29:14,465 --> 01:29:15,637
There's this girl...

1390
01:29:16,267 --> 01:29:17,371
Rashmi.

1391
01:29:20,571 --> 01:29:22,073
My professor's daughter...

1392
01:29:23,707 --> 01:29:25,380
ls this what you do in college?

1393
01:29:25,709 --> 01:29:27,620
Dad, please...
Hear me out.

1394
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,350
Say.

1395
01:29:32,650 --> 01:29:35,221
They're getting her
married to someone else.

1396
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:39,631
Oh, so they're against it, too.

1397
01:29:39,790 --> 01:29:40,825
Good.

1398
01:29:41,759 --> 01:29:43,830
They have a problem with me...

1399
01:29:45,095 --> 01:29:46,267
What problem?

1400
01:29:48,265 --> 01:29:50,802
Bunking... Discipline... Etc.

1401
01:29:56,373 --> 01:29:57,784
Does your mother
know about this?

1402
01:30:00,844 --> 01:30:02,118
Kavita.

1403
01:30:03,447 --> 01:30:04,653
Kavita!

1404
01:30:07,785 --> 01:30:09,287
Did you know about this?

1405
01:30:10,654 --> 01:30:13,658
- Yes, I was going to tell you...
- Tell me when?

1406
01:30:14,091 --> 01:30:15,263
- Dad-
- You be quiet.

1407
01:30:15,326 --> 01:30:16,771
- When were you going to tell me?
- Dad it's not Mom's fault,

1408
01:30:16,827 --> 01:30:18,135
please just talk to
the professor once...

1409
01:30:18,162 --> 01:30:19,732
Why should I talk
to the professor?

1410
01:30:20,331 --> 01:30:22,311
I'm not going to
support this nonsense.

1411
01:30:23,567 --> 01:30:24,637
I love her.

1412
01:30:24,702 --> 01:30:25,772
Forget about it.

1413
01:30:26,737 --> 01:30:28,239
Concentrate on your MBA.

1414
01:30:29,206 --> 01:30:30,514
Girls will come and go.

1415
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:37,090
These are just distractions.

1416
01:30:37,715 --> 01:30:40,093
But you didn't have
any distractions, Dad.

1417
01:30:40,718 --> 01:30:42,254
Let it go, Krish.

1418
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:43,525
What did you say?

1419
01:30:48,726 --> 01:30:50,433
Yet you were thrown
out of the army.

1420
01:30:51,695 --> 01:30:52,765
Why?

1421
01:30:55,499 --> 01:30:57,240
What are you doing, Vikram?

1422
01:30:57,801 --> 01:30:59,303
This is what he deserves.

1423
01:31:00,471 --> 01:31:03,077
He's shameless.
Won't learn any other way.

1424
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:05,849
Good for nothing.

1425
01:31:23,694 --> 01:31:25,799
You know how he
is when he drinks.

1426
01:31:29,433 --> 01:31:31,071
Are you okay?

1427
01:31:33,203 --> 01:31:34,443
Kavita!

1428
01:31:38,575 --> 01:31:40,179
You're the one who's spoiled him!

1429
01:31:40,244 --> 01:31:42,155
- Just listen!
- Listen to what?!

1430
01:31:42,212 --> 01:31:44,493
Sometimes he wants to be a writer,
sometimes he's in love!

1431
01:31:44,515 --> 01:31:46,517
He's a kid!
He needs our support.

1432
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:48,620
I will not support this rubbish!

1433
01:31:48,686 --> 01:31:50,529
He's wasting his time
and my money!

1434
01:31:50,587 --> 01:31:52,533
You could have heard him out!

1435
01:31:53,157 --> 01:31:55,262
Like you can do
anything but drink!

1436
01:31:55,426 --> 01:31:57,633
Then why don't you just leave!

1437
01:31:57,661 --> 01:32:00,608
Marrying you was the
biggest mistake of my life.

1438
01:32:01,598 --> 01:32:03,077
It was your mistake...

1439
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:05,507
and it's my life that's ruined.

1440
01:32:09,373 --> 01:32:10,613
Get out of here.

1441
01:32:11,442 --> 01:32:12,512
Krish, please go.

1442
01:32:13,444 --> 01:32:15,287
I said get out of here!

1443
01:32:16,413 --> 01:32:18,222
Can't you hear what-

1444
01:34:06,089 --> 01:34:08,399
You're so fair!
How can you be a Madrasan?

1445
01:34:08,725 --> 01:34:09,703
Tarn I I ian.

1446
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:13,367
Same thing! Oh, Kavita!
Your daughter-in-law?

1447
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:17,303
I must say she's quite fair
by South Indian standards!

1448
01:34:17,367 --> 01:34:20,246
Rajji, come meet
our Krish's lover!

1449
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:21,380
Anyay!

1450
01:34:21,438 --> 01:34:24,385
Anyay? Like... illegal?!

1451
01:34:38,188 --> 01:34:41,226
"This Punjabi
boy from Jalandhar"

1452
01:34:41,625 --> 01:34:44,799
"Maidens falling
for every glance"

1453
01:34:45,329 --> 01:34:48,538
"Chilling in the fields"

1454
01:34:48,765 --> 01:34:52,303
"Living life King size"

1455
01:34:52,536 --> 01:34:56,074
"It's my way or the highway"

1456
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:59,380
"Who does it make
a difference to?"

1457
01:34:59,509 --> 01:35:02,786
"What, why? Who is who? Only
to whiskey friends are true!"

1458
01:35:03,180 --> 01:35:06,389
"And some chicken with
it only makes things better!"

1459
01:35:06,617 --> 01:35:08,221
"Where the pretty girls are"

1460
01:35:08,285 --> 01:35:09,846
"That's where you'll
find the Jatt boys"

1461
01:35:10,087 --> 01:35:13,625
"Even better if the
girls are up for it too"

1462
01:35:42,085 --> 01:35:45,294
"Punjabi girl,
not so easily charmed"

1463
01:35:45,622 --> 01:35:49,092
"She'll make you dance
on her every tune!"

1464
01:35:49,393 --> 01:35:52,397
"Boys fall by the dozen"

1465
01:35:52,763 --> 01:35:56,210
"for every sway
of their hips!"

1466
01:35:56,566 --> 01:35:58,136
"Dinky on the left"

1467
01:35:58,435 --> 01:36:00,073
"Pinky on the right"

1468
01:36:00,304 --> 01:36:03,513
"Like a fashion parade
of pretty girls!"

1469
01:36:03,573 --> 01:36:07,180
"What, why? Who is who? Only
to whiskey friends are true!"

1470
01:36:07,244 --> 01:36:10,657
"And some chicken with
it only makes things better!"

1471
01:36:10,714 --> 01:36:12,216
"Where the pretty girls are"

1472
01:36:12,282 --> 01:36:14,057
"That's where you'll
find the Jatt boys"

1473
01:36:14,117 --> 01:36:17,724
"Even better if the
girls are up for it too"

1474
01:36:46,483 --> 01:36:53,162
"Don't boast your
broken Punjabi to me"

1475
01:36:53,423 --> 01:37:00,170
"Tell me how much your
promises really mean?"

1476
01:37:00,530 --> 01:37:06,811
"Tell me how much your
promises really mean?"

1477
01:37:07,437 --> 01:37:10,646
"The word of a Jatt
boy is legally binding"

1478
01:37:11,108 --> 01:37:14,646
"He'll sign his
life over to you!"

1479
01:37:14,711 --> 01:37:17,749
"Chilling in the fields"

1480
01:37:18,248 --> 01:37:21,752
"Living life King size"

1481
01:37:22,219 --> 01:37:25,428
"It's my way or the highway"

1482
01:37:25,622 --> 01:37:28,535
"Who does it make
a difference to?"

1483
01:37:29,126 --> 01:37:32,596
"What, why? Who is who? Only
to whiskey friends are true!"

1484
01:37:32,629 --> 01:37:36,133
"And some chicken with
it only makes things better!"

1485
01:37:36,199 --> 01:37:37,576
"Where the pretty girls are"

1486
01:37:37,634 --> 01:37:39,477
"That's where you'll
find the Jatt boys"

1487
01:37:39,669 --> 01:37:43,276
"Even better if the
girls are up for it too"

1488
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:53,850
"And some chicken with
it only makes things better!"

1489
01:37:57,521 --> 01:38:01,196
"Even better if the
girls are up for it too"

1490
01:38:38,195 --> 01:38:40,106
Why is that chubby
uncle so angry?

1491
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:44,372
He must be hungry.

1492
01:38:51,374 --> 01:38:53,820
Everyone's really serious!
Somethings up. Let's find out.

1493
01:39:02,686 --> 01:39:03,721
“Horn!

1494
01:39:10,694 --> 01:39:11,832
What's happening?

1495
01:39:12,162 --> 01:39:13,197
It's too small.

1496
01:39:13,430 --> 01:39:14,534
Duke's tunic?

1497
01:39:14,598 --> 01:39:16,134
It's not funny!

1498
01:39:16,299 --> 01:39:18,870
The car Rajji gave
Duke is too small.

1499
01:39:19,336 --> 01:39:21,316
Oh! And their family
won't fit in it.

1500
01:39:21,805 --> 01:39:24,649
No! They saw the key
and thought it was a big car!

1501
01:39:24,708 --> 01:39:26,551
Oh! They were confused
by the big key!

1502
01:39:26,743 --> 01:39:29,121
I don't believe this!
Now?

1503
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:32,353
They want a big
car or no wedding.

1504
01:39:32,516 --> 01:39:34,325
But Aunty, a gift is a gift.

1505
01:39:34,718 --> 01:39:38,791
Not gift... Dowry.
Anyway, what's the solution?

1506
01:39:39,456 --> 01:39:41,299
Well, Rajji doesn't
have the money.

1507
01:39:41,591 --> 01:39:46,802
So, we've decided to give them
our jewelry as a guarantee.

1508
01:39:47,397 --> 01:39:48,842
You wait, I'll be back.

1509
01:39:51,668 --> 01:39:52,703
Dowry.

1510
01:39:53,637 --> 01:39:54,843
Really?

1511
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:03,787
Ananya...

1512
01:40:04,714 --> 01:40:05,818
Ananya!

1513
01:40:06,383 --> 01:40:07,657
Excuse me?

1514
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:13,724
May I say something?

1515
01:40:14,457 --> 01:40:15,561
What?

1516
01:40:16,459 --> 01:40:19,838
Before you give away your
jewelry, can I talk to Duke?

1517
01:40:20,297 --> 01:40:22,470
No, no. You don't
get involved in this.

1518
01:40:23,166 --> 01:40:24,736
Please, let me try.

1519
01:40:25,569 --> 01:40:27,412
I promise there'll
be no problem.

1520
01:40:46,523 --> 01:40:47,558
Duke...

1521
01:40:48,558 --> 01:40:49,559
Hi.

1522
01:40:49,626 --> 01:40:50,661
Hi!

1523
01:40:50,827 --> 01:40:52,363
What's your salary?

1524
01:40:53,263 --> 01:40:54,264
What?!

1525
01:40:55,265 --> 01:40:58,212
- How much do you earn per month?
- What?!

1526
01:41:11,715 --> 01:41:13,592
25 thousand.
Who are you?

1527
01:41:13,650 --> 01:41:14,754
Doesn't matter.

1528
01:41:15,285 --> 01:41:16,787
I earn 50.

1529
01:41:16,853 --> 01:41:22,235
Can you tell me why you
deserve such grand wedding?

1530
01:41:23,226 --> 01:41:25,137
And you're getting
a car for dowry!

1531
01:41:26,296 --> 01:41:27,536
I'm the boy!

1532
01:41:28,064 --> 01:41:30,066
Really? So?

1533
01:41:31,401 --> 01:41:32,573
So!

1534
01:41:33,503 --> 01:41:34,641
So...

1535
01:41:36,206 --> 01:41:37,480
Look at Minty carefully.

1536
01:41:39,276 --> 01:41:43,383
You think you had a shot with
her without an arranged marriage?

1537
01:41:43,647 --> 01:41:46,423
- This is the limit!
- Oh no, I'm not done.

1538
01:41:51,588 --> 01:41:53,761
Do you know what they've
been through for this wedding?

1539
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:56,297
They' re in debt.

1540
01:41:56,593 --> 01:41:58,231
And this car?

1541
01:41:58,495 --> 01:42:01,066
It costs as much as 15
years of your holiday bonuses!

1542
01:42:01,464 --> 01:42:04,570
And the car you want, you won't be
able to afford even after retirement.

1543
01:42:05,635 --> 01:42:08,275
If you twist their arm,
they'll give you the bigger car...

1544
01:42:08,471 --> 01:42:10,747
but don't you
have any self-respect?!

1545
01:42:19,316 --> 01:42:21,296
Look, you can get the big car.

1546
01:42:22,285 --> 01:42:26,199
Now you decide; do you want
to get married honourably...

1547
01:42:26,523 --> 01:42:30,494
or let go of a girl
like Minty because of a car?

1548
01:42:32,329 --> 01:42:34,206
Ananya... let it go.

1549
01:42:35,031 --> 01:42:36,601
Two minutes, Uncle.

1550
01:42:38,335 --> 01:42:40,178
You have two minutes to decide.

1551
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:45,051
- I want to go to my Mummy.
- Why?

1552
01:42:45,408 --> 01:42:47,388
Why are you so dominating?!

1553
01:42:47,544 --> 01:42:49,387
Please, let me to go
to my Mummy.

1554
01:42:49,746 --> 01:42:52,090
Okay. We'll all go.

1555
01:42:52,782 --> 01:42:54,227
Come on then!

1556
01:42:59,389 --> 01:43:01,300
Mummy! I like this car.

1557
01:43:01,458 --> 01:43:03,495
But, the deal was for big car!

1558
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:06,131
Can't I buy a
big car on my own?

1559
01:43:06,363 --> 01:43:09,708
Don't I have any self-respect?
Stop this silly fighting.

1560
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:11,238
What's the decision?

1561
01:43:12,102 --> 01:43:15,777
Sorry, madam. Done.
Okay? I want to get married!

1562
01:43:20,176 --> 01:43:21,712
So Duke's parents
relented and...

1563
01:43:21,778 --> 01:43:24,486
Ananya became a
hero to my family.

1564
01:43:29,686 --> 01:43:30,756
Thank you.

1565
01:43:31,254 --> 01:43:32,289
Here.

1566
01:43:33,490 --> 01:43:35,492
Rajji and Shipra loved her.

1567
01:43:36,793 --> 01:43:38,101
So... yes?

1568
01:43:38,395 --> 01:43:39,430
Yes...

1569
01:43:39,629 --> 01:43:42,109
- But what about her folks?
- They've agreed.

1570
01:43:45,368 --> 01:43:46,472
Look, Ananya.

1571
01:43:46,736 --> 01:43:49,683
Both families need to
have an understanding.

1572
01:43:53,209 --> 01:43:54,711
You remember the convocation?

1573
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:02,161
Your mom's right.

1574
01:44:02,685 --> 01:44:03,720
Meaning?

1575
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:08,666
I mean our parents have agreed,
but they still don't like each other.

1576
01:44:09,092 --> 01:44:11,834
So what? It's not like
they're getting married.

1577
01:44:12,629 --> 01:44:16,099
If we've decided to make
them happy, let's do it right?

1578
01:44:17,667 --> 01:44:19,772
They have to meet again.

1579
01:44:20,336 --> 01:44:23,249
No, now enough, okay?
I can't play this game forever.

1580
01:44:23,506 --> 01:44:26,419
What more can I do?
Get Mom to Chennai?

1581
01:44:26,576 --> 01:44:27,646
No!

1582
01:44:29,245 --> 01:44:30,451
Let's go on vacation?

1583
01:44:30,747 --> 01:44:32,021
All of us!

1584
01:44:32,248 --> 01:44:34,626
That way they'll
get to know each other.

1585
01:44:35,718 --> 01:44:37,026
Please?

1586
01:44:38,388 --> 01:44:41,028
In this world, what's the most
important reason to get married?

1587
01:44:41,524 --> 01:44:42,525
Love!

1588
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:46,641
In India, however,
there are a few more steps...

1589
01:44:47,263 --> 01:44:49,539
The girl's family
has to love the boy.

1590
01:44:49,566 --> 01:44:51,341
The boy's family
has to love the girl.

1591
01:44:52,168 --> 01:44:54,088
The boy's family has
to love the girl's family...

1592
01:44:54,137 --> 01:44:56,310
and the girl's family
has to love the boy's family.

1593
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:58,480
After all this...

1594
01:44:58,641 --> 01:45:02,680
if the boy and girl still love
each other, then they get married.

1595
01:45:15,692 --> 01:45:19,606
What's bugging them? Look how
they're standing there looking surly.

1596
01:45:19,662 --> 01:45:20,732
Nothing like that!

1597
01:45:20,997 --> 01:45:22,757
What do you know of
the politics of marriage?

1598
01:45:23,566 --> 01:45:24,704
Thank you.

1599
01:45:24,767 --> 01:45:27,714
By the way, Krish... This
hotel must be very expensive.

1600
01:45:28,471 --> 01:45:33,216
Yes, but I've promised to hold
the next YES Bank conference here.

1601
01:45:33,743 --> 01:45:35,381
So, they've given
me a discount.

1602
01:45:36,045 --> 01:45:39,049
Come now, smile, please?
Smile.

1603
01:45:40,683 --> 01:45:42,060
Namaste, Kavita.

1604
01:45:42,118 --> 01:45:43,620
- Namaste.
- Hello, Aunty.

1605
01:45:43,686 --> 01:45:44,790
Hello.

1606
01:45:46,756 --> 01:45:50,067
Oh! This is for you.
Silk sari.

1607
01:45:50,126 --> 01:45:51,230
Tussar silk.

1608
01:45:51,294 --> 01:45:53,638
Specially for you
from Assam Emporium.

1609
01:45:54,330 --> 01:45:55,468
Thank you.

1610
01:45:55,632 --> 01:45:58,078
Our silk saris
are also very famous.

1611
01:45:58,101 --> 01:46:00,138
- Of course!
- Kanjeevaram saris.

1612
01:46:04,207 --> 01:46:06,153
Your husband couldn't come?

1613
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:10,314
He's not keeping well.

1614
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:13,691
The doctors have asked
him not to travel by air.

1615
01:46:14,484 --> 01:46:16,122
Isn't there a train from Delhi?

1616
01:46:17,453 --> 01:46:18,830
We don't travel by train.

1617
01:46:19,255 --> 01:46:22,236
Their toilets
are awfully small.

1618
01:46:22,292 --> 01:46:23,771
Shall we go, mom?

1619
01:46:24,694 --> 01:46:28,039
You know we Punjabis
are really large-hearted.

1620
01:46:28,097 --> 01:46:31,078
We never greet our
in-laws empty handed.

1621
01:46:31,167 --> 01:46:33,340
Especially, the boy's mother!

1622
01:46:33,403 --> 01:46:36,543
It's considered bad luck...

1623
01:46:36,606 --> 01:46:39,746
Shall we go sightseeing tomorrow?
Coffee Shop at 11 am?

1624
01:46:40,710 --> 01:46:43,384
Sightseeing! With her?

1625
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:45,489
- Mom.
- No.

1626
01:46:45,548 --> 01:46:46,754
Dad, please!

1627
01:46:47,250 --> 01:46:49,127
Done! Sightseeing!

1628
01:46:50,353 --> 01:46:54,062
Oh, the hotel has upgraded us.

1629
01:46:54,123 --> 01:46:55,602
Please, take the bigger room.

1630
01:46:55,658 --> 01:46:57,194
There are more of you.

1631
01:46:57,560 --> 01:46:58,766
What about us!

1632
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:05,079
- Let's go.
- No, no Aunty!

1633
01:47:10,173 --> 01:47:11,379
How shameless!

1634
01:47:11,441 --> 01:47:13,045
Who?! Him?

1635
01:47:13,109 --> 01:47:14,349
No. Them.

1636
01:47:14,677 --> 01:47:16,679
Who makes the groom
pick up luggage?!

1637
01:47:16,746 --> 01:47:19,192
- I'm not the "groom".
- What then, the bride?!

1638
01:47:19,248 --> 01:47:21,285
Don't talk rubbish!

1639
01:47:21,651 --> 01:47:23,722
What was the need to
give them the big room?

1640
01:47:23,786 --> 01:47:25,288
There's more of them?

1641
01:47:25,622 --> 01:47:26,726
Sure, sure.

1642
01:47:26,789 --> 01:47:30,566
Those poor guys mustn't have
ever seen such a grand hotel.

1643
01:47:31,561 --> 01:47:33,472
You know what their
biggest mistake was?

1644
01:47:33,529 --> 01:47:35,805
They met the boy's
mother empty-handed!

1645
01:47:36,399 --> 01:47:41,348
And that Madrasan called
ME uncultured at that conversation.

1646
01:47:42,171 --> 01:47:45,709
Why did I have to get carried
away and buy her a silk sari?

1647
01:47:47,243 --> 01:47:49,280
Rs. 2,000 down the drain.

1648
01:47:56,152 --> 01:47:57,688
How pretty the sea is!

1649
01:47:58,855 --> 01:48:02,359
Yes, but Chennai's sea is
cleaner and prettier than this!

1650
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:19,880
Hanging Gardens!
What a nice view!

1651
01:48:20,543 --> 01:48:23,717
What?!
People are hanged here?!

1652
01:48:25,481 --> 01:48:28,553
It's called Hanging Gardens
because it's on a hill!

1653
01:48:28,818 --> 01:48:32,197
Oh... you scared me...

1654
01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:45,304
Your mom is so rude!

1655
01:48:45,768 --> 01:48:49,113
Your family's not
exactly friendly, either.

1656
01:48:49,639 --> 01:48:51,141
What do we do?

1657
01:48:52,075 --> 01:48:53,595
I have an idea.
But you can't feel bad.

1658
01:48:54,343 --> 01:48:55,447
Depends.

1659
01:48:55,678 --> 01:48:59,820
First, you'll need to get my
mother a really nice present.

1660
01:49:00,583 --> 01:49:02,290
- Okay...
- Next.

1661
01:49:02,552 --> 01:49:05,465
Whenever we're eating out,
insist on paying.

1662
01:49:05,822 --> 01:49:10,202
Snatch her purse if you have to!
Punjabis consider this affection.

1663
01:49:10,426 --> 01:49:11,461
And?

1664
01:49:11,527 --> 01:49:15,498
Third, right now, in the middle
of this beach, you and I should...

1665
01:49:15,531 --> 01:49:18,535
Absolutely not! Not until the
wedding. I'm very stressed!

1666
01:49:18,735 --> 01:49:20,112
But it's a great stress buster!

1667
01:49:20,169 --> 01:49:21,443
Control yourself, Krish!

1668
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:26,618
You know what the worst
part of getting married is?

1669
01:49:27,110 --> 01:49:29,818
First, you have to discuss
clothes and jewelry.

1670
01:49:30,713 --> 01:49:34,354
Second, all women lose their
tempers at the same time! I mean...

1671
01:49:37,286 --> 01:49:39,061
So many demands already...

1672
01:49:39,455 --> 01:49:41,230
God knows what will
happen in the future!

1673
01:49:53,302 --> 01:49:54,337
This is for you.

1674
01:49:54,403 --> 01:49:56,474
Oh, you shouldn't have!

1675
01:49:58,374 --> 01:49:59,512
This too.

1676
01:50:01,110 --> 01:50:02,748
Please come! Sit!

1677
01:50:11,487 --> 01:50:13,763
Have some chicken!
It's delicious!

1678
01:50:13,823 --> 01:50:15,427
We're vegetarians...

1679
01:50:16,425 --> 01:50:17,699
Oh.

1680
01:50:18,427 --> 01:50:20,566
Well... no problem.

1681
01:50:35,478 --> 01:50:36,752
Who would have thought...

1682
01:50:37,079 --> 01:50:39,119
One day the kids would
be introducing their parents!

1683
01:50:40,149 --> 01:50:43,687
It came as a
shock to us, too...

1684
01:50:44,187 --> 01:50:47,327
But once we met Krish,
we were okay.

1685
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:52,135
Oh, don't pull my leg!
You must have thanked your stars...

1686
01:50:52,295 --> 01:50:55,799
that your daughter found
such a handsome and qualified boy!

1687
01:50:58,167 --> 01:51:01,307
Actually, 90 percent of
Tamilians are highly qualified.

1688
01:51:01,637 --> 01:51:04,641
All of Ananya's uncles
are engineers in the USA.

1689
01:51:04,841 --> 01:51:08,687
I'm sorry but 90% Tamilians
aren't fair-skinned either!

1690
01:51:08,744 --> 01:51:10,485
Mom! Mom, let's have dessert

1691
01:51:11,314 --> 01:51:12,622
Oh by the way...

1692
01:51:12,782 --> 01:51:16,662
Krish's uncles are also
very rich and successful!

1693
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:21,259
Ananya met them at our place!
What a magnificent wedding it was!

1694
01:51:22,158 --> 01:51:27,437
My brother gave his son-in-law
a car as a wedding present!

1695
01:51:32,201 --> 01:51:35,580
How lucky you are... to have
landed such a wonderful boy!

1696
01:51:36,072 --> 01:51:37,380
Luck by chance!

1697
01:51:37,673 --> 01:51:39,311
Mom, what are you saying!

1698
01:51:39,709 --> 01:51:42,212
We haven't conned
your son into this.

1699
01:51:42,745 --> 01:51:45,191
He came to our house everyday,
we couldn't say no.

1700
01:51:45,481 --> 01:51:46,824
- Mom...
- It's true!

1701
01:51:47,216 --> 01:51:49,423
We're making a big
effort for you, too.

1702
01:51:50,286 --> 01:51:53,563
Everyone knows Krish's father
is against this marriage.

1703
01:51:54,056 --> 01:51:55,558
We're still here, aren't we?

1704
01:51:56,826 --> 01:51:59,136
Well, you're not
doing me any favours.

1705
01:51:59,328 --> 01:52:03,640
Millionaire Punjabi girls
are lining up for my Krish.

1706
01:52:05,234 --> 01:52:06,440
There's no need to yell.
We are educated people.

1707
01:52:06,502 --> 01:52:08,243
- Oh and we're illiterate?!
- Mom...

1708
01:52:08,404 --> 01:52:11,442
He said we.
All of us are educated!

1709
01:52:11,507 --> 01:52:13,851
Shut up!
You're blind to everything!

1710
01:52:14,644 --> 01:52:16,590
Go... live in Chennai
with your in-laws!

1711
01:52:16,646 --> 01:52:18,353
Krish. This is not right.

1712
01:52:18,547 --> 01:52:20,322
- Let it go, mom.
- You be quiet!

1713
01:52:21,417 --> 01:52:23,021
This won't work out.

1714
01:52:23,252 --> 01:52:26,324
She won't keep our child happy.
Look at the things she says!

1715
01:52:26,389 --> 01:52:27,800
What are they muttering
in their code language?

1716
01:52:28,157 --> 01:52:29,192
How would I know'?!

1717
01:52:29,258 --> 01:52:31,033
I thought they'd
have taught you by now!

1718
01:52:31,193 --> 01:52:32,672
This is not okay,
let us get going.

1719
01:52:33,329 --> 01:52:34,774
This is way too much. Come.

1720
01:52:35,364 --> 01:52:37,344
- Dad, please...
- That's it! We're leaving!

1721
01:52:56,218 --> 01:52:57,822
Aunty we did
whatever Krish asked.

1722
01:52:58,621 --> 01:53:00,498
But nothing is enough for you.

1723
01:53:01,490 --> 01:53:05,836
Ananya, we'll talk to them...
It's not like that.

1724
01:53:08,164 --> 01:53:09,302
Thanks for lunch.

1725
01:53:15,771 --> 01:53:17,808
So, you told them to
buy these saris for me.

1726
01:53:18,174 --> 01:53:21,087
Yes. What's the point
of doing all this?!

1727
01:53:21,477 --> 01:53:24,287
Of course.
It's always my fault!

1728
01:53:25,648 --> 01:53:27,025
People are right.

1729
01:53:27,483 --> 01:53:29,394
Falling in love changes
the best of men.

1730
01:53:29,452 --> 01:53:30,487
That's not true!

1731
01:53:54,710 --> 01:53:58,055
Did you see how rude
your dear Ananya was to me?

1732
01:53:58,414 --> 01:54:01,554
I know she's a little brazen,
but you were wrong this time, Mom.

1733
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:06,066
You're going to
treat me as a servant?

1734
01:54:06,722 --> 01:54:10,192
My life is doomed.

1735
01:54:10,426 --> 01:54:12,599
No one is making
you a servant, mom!

1736
01:54:12,762 --> 01:54:16,335
Daughters-in-law
can't be so rude!

1737
01:54:16,732 --> 01:54:17,767
Just think.

1738
01:54:17,833 --> 01:54:20,609
What if Minty speaks
in this way to Duke's mother?!

1739
01:54:21,704 --> 01:54:24,776
We rule our daughters-in-law
with iron fists!

1740
01:54:27,410 --> 01:54:28,514
Okay.

1741
01:54:29,545 --> 01:54:31,115
You can do it too.

1742
01:54:32,581 --> 01:54:35,425
How! You always take her side.

1743
01:54:35,718 --> 01:54:37,095
I won't!

1744
01:54:38,187 --> 01:54:41,396
Once we're married,
you show her who's the boss!

1745
01:54:42,258 --> 01:54:46,104
You know how passive
her parents are.

1746
01:54:46,128 --> 01:54:47,402
They can't do anything.

1747
01:54:48,264 --> 01:54:51,370
Please just handle
the situation for now.

1748
01:54:52,568 --> 01:54:53,638
Please?

1749
01:54:56,038 --> 01:54:57,108
Fine.

1750
01:55:00,743 --> 01:55:02,154
Ananya.

1751
01:55:02,812 --> 01:55:05,122
- We were just talking about you-
- I heard.

1752
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:20,166
I wanted to make one
last attempt to fix things.

1753
01:55:22,164 --> 01:55:23,438
But not anymore.

1754
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:26,446
Ananya, Ananya!
Just listen to me!

1755
01:55:31,607 --> 01:55:33,086
Ananya, please listen to me!

1756
01:55:33,242 --> 01:55:35,119
I was trying to pacify Mom!

1757
01:55:35,611 --> 01:55:37,784
You're telling me the
same lies you told her!

1758
01:55:39,682 --> 01:55:42,060
The problem's not just
your mother. It's you, too.

1759
01:55:45,321 --> 01:55:46,629
We're done, Krish.

1760
01:55:47,256 --> 01:55:48,701
Are you insane?
For such a minor thing...

1761
01:55:48,757 --> 01:55:52,728
Minor thing?! My parents can't
take any more humiliation!

1762
01:55:53,696 --> 01:55:56,199
- They've done a lot for me!
- I can fix this, Ananya.

1763
01:55:56,265 --> 01:55:58,404
By lying to your mother.
Right?

1764
01:56:01,203 --> 01:56:02,739
How many people
will you lie to?

1765
01:56:03,672 --> 01:56:06,243
All your lies will
destroy us one day!

1766
01:56:06,809 --> 01:56:08,379
Everything will be okay.

1767
01:56:09,245 --> 01:56:10,588
We've made a huge mistake...

1768
01:56:12,348 --> 01:56:16,319
You know, Krish, it's
not about the communities...

1769
01:56:17,453 --> 01:56:21,663
it's about the kind of people
we want to spend our lives with.

1770
01:56:24,660 --> 01:56:26,697
Certain things are
just not in our destiny...

1771
01:56:29,331 --> 01:56:30,503
Like this.

1772
01:56:47,349 --> 01:56:50,353
"Without you... there's
no fire in the sun"

1773
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:54,501
"No song in the songbird"

1774
01:56:55,491 --> 01:56:59,667
"if the moon reigns
with such abandon"

1775
01:57:00,229 --> 01:57:05,372
"Why is there only
darkness in my grasp?"

1776
01:57:12,374 --> 01:57:15,787
"Without you... there's
no spring in the springtime"

1777
01:57:16,579 --> 01:57:19,788

Please eat?

1790
01:58:46,335 --> 01:58:48,375
So... you've stopped talking
to your mother as well?

1791
01:58:50,105 --> 01:58:52,551
What wrong could she have done?

1792
01:58:53,342 --> 01:58:54,412
I'm tired, Dad.

1793
01:58:54,576 --> 01:58:55,646
Forgive me.

1794
01:58:56,545 --> 01:58:58,388

She's an optimist,
she has her dreams...

1801
01:59:24,506 --> 01:59:27,180

01:59:41,123 --> 01:59:42,227
Why are you here, Krish?

1805
01:59:43,392 --> 01:59:44,462
To say sorry.

1806
01:59:45,327 --> 01:59:46,499
It's not your fault.

1807
01:59:48,430 --> 01:59:50,307
But I'm the one suffering.

1808
01:59:52,301 --> 01:59:53,780
You look terrible...

1809
02:00:00,476 --> 02:00:04,322
You know your mom will
never accept my family.

1810
02:00:07,182 --> 02:00:08,354
Let's run away?

1811
02:00:15,724 --> 02:00:18,568
Isn't it enough that
we love each other?

1812
02:00:18,627 --> 02:00:19,833
It's never enough...

1813
02:00:20,295 --> 02:00:22,468
Ananya, you're killing me.

1814
02:00:23,665 --> 02:00:26,145
You think it's not hard for me?

1815
02:00:26,201 --> 02:00:29,045
If it's hard,
then why are you doing this?

1816
02:00:30,472 --> 02:00:33,282
So that we both stop
hurting each other.

1817
02:00:34,576 --> 02:00:36,419
I love you, Ananya.

1818
02:00:39,448 --> 02:00:41,052
Please leave, Krish.

1819
02:00:47,556 --> 02:00:48,591
Listen.

1820
02:00:51,627 --> 02:00:53,629
Please, stop calling me.

1849
02:03:53,542 --> 02:03:54,612

1853
02:04:14,329 --> 02:04:15,774
The one from Chennai...

1854
02:04:16,365 --> 02:04:17,742
who was at Minty's wedding.

1855
02:04:19,468 --> 02:04:21,175
I don't know.
She's probably fine.

02:04:23,372 --> 02:04:24,442
Why don't you know?

1857
02:04:26,041 --> 02:04:27,247
Aren't you'll in touch?

speak to one another...

02:04:56,238 --> 02:04:58,514
I'll give you the
printout tomorrow

1864

Do me a favour
and shave at least?

just say yes.

forced you to do anything.

1868

Don't behave like this with me.

1869
02:05:38,013 --> 02:05:39,185
Then how should I behave?

1870
02:05:39,748 --> 02:05:40,783
Fine.

1871
02:05:41,049 --> 02:05:42,756
I'll just shut up, then.

1872
02:05:43,752 --> 02:05:46,665
First my husband, now my son.

1873
02:05:47,422 --> 02:05:52,371
I thought at least my in-laws would
respect me once you got married...

1874
02:05:52,694 --> 02:05:54,731
but no.

1875
02:05:55,230 --> 02:05:58,074
You want me to go and
beg in front of those Madrasis.

1876
02:05:59,267 --> 02:06:02,373
Shipra's right.
Everyone is selfish. Everyone.

1877
02:06:02,437 --> 02:06:04,212
I've never, ever refused you.

1878
02:06:05,173 --> 02:06:08,416
I'm tired of making
up for Dad's faults.

1879
02:06:10,479 --> 02:06:12,049
That's why I'm in this state.

1880
02:06:16,318 --> 02:06:17,695
What are you trying to say?

1881
02:06:18,820 --> 02:06:22,131
For once in life, I needed your help.
And what did you do? You turned away.

1882
02:06:22,591 --> 02:06:23,729
Where do I go novﬂ

1883
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:26,532
I'm a fool.

1884
02:06:28,263 --> 02:06:29,708
I disgust myself!

1885
02:06:31,299 --> 02:06:35,509
I love Ananya and
I'm still letting her go.

1886
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:48,684
Mom, you talk of community,
religion, Madrasis, Punjabis...

1887
02:06:50,385 --> 02:06:53,594
you married a Punjabi,
right? What came of it?

1888
02:08:18,306 --> 02:08:19,341
And where were you?

1889
02:08:21,109 --> 02:08:22,247
What is it to you?

1890
02:08:24,246 --> 02:08:26,351
This family is beyond repair.

1891
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:53,241
Hello?

1892
02:08:54,276 --> 02:08:55,346
Hello?

1893
02:08:57,579 --> 02:08:58,580
Krish.

1894
02:09:01,182 --> 02:09:02,252
Ananya...

1895
02:09:04,586 --> 02:09:06,259
Did you mis-dial?

1896
02:09:07,122 --> 02:09:08,533
I'm sorry about
the other day...

1897
02:09:09,758 --> 02:09:11,499
But you could have told me.

1898
02:09:12,661 --> 02:09:13,765
What?

1899
02:09:13,828 --> 02:09:16,138
That your dad was
coming to my house.

1900
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:20,270
What do you mean?

1901
02:09:20,769 --> 02:09:24,410
He spent the whole
day with Mom and Dad...

1902
02:09:25,573 --> 02:09:27,644
He apologized on
behalf of your mother.

1903
02:09:28,643 --> 02:09:30,782
My dad... apologized?

1904
02:09:31,346 --> 02:09:32,484
Yes.

1905
02:09:33,248 --> 02:09:34,784
My parents are so happy!

1906
02:09:35,283 --> 02:09:39,823
In fact, they asked if
we had a date in mind.

1907
02:09:45,093 --> 02:09:46,231
Ls there?

1908
02:09:50,065 --> 02:09:51,772
A date you have in mind?

1909
02:09:53,768 --> 02:09:55,179
Krish...

1910
02:09:55,437 --> 02:09:58,247
In trying to bring
everyone together...

1911
02:09:59,474 --> 02:10:01,112
have we grown apart?

1912
02:10:02,177 --> 02:10:03,588
I haven't gone away, Ananya.

1913
02:10:03,845 --> 02:10:05,256
I'm right here.

1914
02:10:07,148 --> 02:10:08,388
I love you, Krish.

1915
02:10:11,119 --> 02:10:12,325
Me too, Ananya.

1916
02:10:13,621 --> 02:10:15,328
Do you mean it?

1917
02:10:16,791 --> 02:10:18,293
I'm losing my mind...

1918
02:10:19,227 --> 02:10:20,797
I can't eat or sleep.

1919
02:10:21,730 --> 02:10:24,142
All I think about is you.

1920
02:10:25,033 --> 02:10:26,273
Isn't it clear?

1921
02:10:26,701 --> 02:10:28,180
I love you.

1922
02:10:32,073 --> 02:10:33,108
Good.

1923
02:10:35,143 --> 02:10:36,451
Now, it seems convincing.

1924
02:10:40,749 --> 02:10:42,160
Hang on.

1925
02:10:42,450 --> 02:10:44,794
My dad was at your house?

1926
02:10:45,687 --> 02:10:47,132
Didn't you know?

1927
02:10:47,722 --> 02:10:48,792
No...

1928
02:10:50,458 --> 02:10:51,835
We'll talk in the morning.

1929
02:10:52,227 --> 02:10:53,399
Yes...

1930
02:10:54,629 --> 02:10:55,699
Good night.

1931
02:10:55,830 --> 02:10:57,173
Good night.

1932
02:12:18,713 --> 02:12:20,090
Did you go to Chennai?

1933
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:26,358
Thank you.

1934
02:12:31,126 --> 02:12:32,366
You knew.

1935
02:12:35,497 --> 02:12:38,273
I'm a bad man.
Not a stupid one.

1936
02:12:40,602 --> 02:12:44,379
I didn't want to lose
my son in my old age.

1937
02:12:47,175 --> 02:12:48,381
They're nice...

1938
02:12:49,344 --> 02:12:51,620
Ananya's parents, nice people.

1939
02:12:52,180 --> 02:12:53,318
Yes...

1940
02:12:58,553 --> 02:13:02,501
I can't come to
your wedding, Krish.

1941
02:13:08,163 --> 02:13:10,364
For the first time in years
I've done something right...

1942
02:13:11,799 --> 02:13:13,801
I'm afraid...
if I come... I'll ruin it...

1943
02:13:16,304 --> 02:13:20,116
You know I can't get along
with your mother's family.

1944
02:13:20,508 --> 02:13:22,215
You won't come to my wedding?

1945
02:13:23,678 --> 02:13:26,158
Look, Ananya is
coming to our home.

1946
02:13:27,048 --> 02:13:28,220
Right?

1947
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:31,429
Then why do you want
to put me through my paces?

1948
02:13:41,696 --> 02:13:42,674
That day...

1949
02:13:42,730 --> 02:13:44,539
I wanted to hug my father.

1950
02:13:47,535 --> 02:13:49,515
But that would've
been melodramatic, right?

1951
02:13:52,040 --> 02:13:54,281
Suddenly if everything
falls into place...

1952
02:13:55,276 --> 02:13:56,721
life becomes boring.

1953
02:13:59,180 --> 02:14:00,523
Okay, tell me what happens
in a Brahmin wedding.

1954
02:14:00,782 --> 02:14:02,056
A lot.

1955
02:14:02,250 --> 02:14:04,287
Prepare your family
to see a lot of new rituals.

1956
02:14:04,519 --> 02:14:06,556
All Punjabis want
to see is alcohol.

1957
02:14:08,089 --> 02:14:09,193
Done!

1958
02:14:11,392 --> 02:14:13,099
Everything will be fine, right?

1959
02:14:14,495 --> 02:14:15,496
Of course.

1960
02:14:15,563 --> 02:14:17,133
Ananya, come here.

1961
02:14:18,099 --> 02:14:19,669
Come soon.
I miss you.

1962
02:14:20,068 --> 02:14:21,206
I miss you, too.

1963
02:14:49,530 --> 02:14:51,100
"Hurray!"

1964
02:14:52,600 --> 02:14:54,273
"Hurray!"

1965
02:14:55,670 --> 02:14:58,549
"The bride and groom
make a gorgeous pair!"

1966
02:14:58,606 --> 02:15:02,315
Just pray we don't get
fall sick with all that sambar!

1967
02:15:04,145 --> 02:15:05,351
Joke!

1968
02:15:05,580 --> 02:15:08,220
"Breaking traditions
and reigning chaos"

1969
02:15:08,650 --> 02:15:14,623
"Weaving a love story
on the crossroads of destiny"

1970
02:15:14,789 --> 02:15:17,827
"The pongal pot is boiling
My love speaks to you"

1971
02:15:18,092 --> 02:15:20,766
"The husband brings
good luck, girl"

1972
02:15:21,029 --> 02:15:24,033
"Running with love
Did she catch me?"

1973
02:15:24,098 --> 02:15:26,704
"Or was she caught?"

1974
02:15:27,035 --> 02:15:30,039
"Here comes the
bride's carriage"

1975
02:15:30,104 --> 02:15:33,142
"With the fancy band dancing"

1976
02:15:33,207 --> 02:15:38,088
"Symphonising with trumpets!"

1977
02:15:38,313 --> 02:15:39,690
Namaste.

1978
02:15:42,517 --> 02:15:43,655
Excuse me...

1979
02:15:43,718 --> 02:15:46,062
Can we have a word with you?

1980
02:15:47,722 --> 02:15:48,757
Of course.

1981
02:15:51,259 --> 02:15:54,240
"Hope springs in the air"

1982
02:15:54,295 --> 02:15:55,330
"Hurray!"

1983
02:15:57,398 --> 02:15:58,638
"Oh, the bride..."

1984
02:16:00,435 --> 02:16:01,709
"Hurray!"

1985
02:16:04,305 --> 02:16:05,477
What happened?

1986
02:16:06,741 --> 02:16:09,051
They asked us what
gifts we wanted!

1987
02:16:09,177 --> 02:16:10,383
What did you ask for?

1988
02:16:10,578 --> 02:16:13,821
TV? Fridge? Bungalow? Boat!

1989
02:16:14,182 --> 02:16:15,354
Do I think I'm crazy?

1990
02:16:15,416 --> 02:16:18,625
She didn't ask for anything!
She got emotional unnecessarily!

1991
02:16:18,686 --> 02:16:21,292
She said she wished for
one MBA, she'd getting two!

1992
02:16:21,356 --> 02:16:23,358
What better gift than that?!

1993
02:16:23,591 --> 02:16:25,298
<i>'</i> Really?
_ Yes! <i>'</i>

1994
02:16:25,626 --> 02:16:27,572
You know what your
problem is, Krish?

1995
02:16:28,229 --> 02:16:30,539
You have no idea
how much I love you.

1996
02:16:31,766 --> 02:16:33,211
Let's g0!

1997
02:16:38,039 --> 02:16:40,485
Who on eanh gets married
at 6.30 in the morning?!

1998
02:16:41,075 --> 02:16:43,214
Only yoga classes
happen that early!

1999
02:16:44,011 --> 02:16:45,217
Boy's father?

2000
02:16:47,615 --> 02:16:48,753
J ust a second!

2001
02:16:53,588 --> 02:16:56,034
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

2002
02:17:57,752 --> 02:18:01,700
"l can't tear my eyes away"

2003
02:18:03,658 --> 02:18:08,368
"As they seek your
acceptance, too"

2004
02:18:09,497 --> 02:18:14,810
"The kohl of your eyes
tinges my days"

2005
02:18:15,336 --> 02:18:20,251
"While the smell of your
perfume haunts my nights"

2006
02:18:20,308 --> 02:18:22,811
"Spellbound, this mind..."

2007
02:18:23,077 --> 02:18:25,683
"Speaks only your name"

2008
02:18:26,080 --> 02:18:28,788
"Spellbound, this mind..."

2009
02:18:29,050 --> 02:18:31,530
"Speaks only your name"

2010
02:18:32,286 --> 02:18:35,460
"Would that it could..."

2011
02:18:35,523 --> 02:18:37,560
but it can't forget"

2012
02:18:37,625 --> 02:18:40,469
"Spellbound, this mind..."

2013
02:18:40,528 --> 02:18:43,338
"Speaks only your name"

2014
02:18:43,397 --> 02:18:46,276
"Spellbound, this mind..."

2015
02:18:46,334 --> 02:18:50,805
"Speaks only your name"

2016
02:18:52,807 --> 02:18:56,311
The boy's mother will sit there...

2017
02:18:56,377 --> 02:18:59,847
and if the father isn't here,
then any senior member can-

2018
02:19:00,081 --> 02:19:01,151
Father is here.

2019
02:19:22,603 --> 02:19:23,775
What is he doing here?

2020
02:19:25,506 --> 02:19:26,712
He arrived last night.

2021
02:19:28,776 --> 02:19:30,119
Namaste!

2022
02:19:30,545 --> 02:19:31,717
Please.

2023
02:20:18,626 --> 02:20:20,333
I've made a lot of mistakes...

2024
02:20:25,666 --> 02:20:28,112
will you hate me all my life?

2025
02:20:50,825 --> 02:20:56,741
"Our hearts sing the song
That tells our story"

2026
02:20:56,797 --> 02:20:58,743
Why do our parents oppose this?

2027
02:21:00,267 --> 02:21:02,304
- It's not about communities...

2028
02:21:03,270 --> 02:21:07,184
It's about us finding love
without their consent...

2029
02:21:13,781 --> 02:21:18,526
If we fall in love with someone, doesn't
mean we love our parents any less...

2030
02:21:19,153 --> 02:21:21,599
Love doesn't need to be divided;
It's all encompassing.

2031
02:21:22,223 --> 02:21:26,638
They should be proud that, like them,
now our love is unconditional.

2032
02:21:42,543 --> 02:21:45,524
From our first word
to our first cigarette...

2033
02:21:46,047 --> 02:21:47,355
they've seen it all.

2034
02:21:48,215 --> 02:21:51,719
Now they suddenly
feel betrayed.

2035
02:21:52,386 --> 02:21:53,797
That's why they get angry.

2036
02:22:21,315 --> 02:22:25,320
Maybe after 25 years,
when we're in their shoes...

2037
02:22:25,686 --> 02:22:29,031
maybe then we'll understand.

2038
02:22:29,686 --> 02:22:32,031
