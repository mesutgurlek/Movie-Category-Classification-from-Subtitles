1
00:00:31,527 --> 00:00:34,234
 I got some money
in my pocket

2
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:36,896
 I got the car keys in my hand

3
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:39,406
 I got myself a couple
of tickets... 

4
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:48,202
Hey

5
00:00:48,377 --> 00:00:50,333
 Come on, babe,
you know there ain't no time

6
00:00:50,504 --> 00:00:52,756
 To mess around round, round

7
00:00:52,923 --> 00:00:55,585
 Evie, Evie

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,627
 Evie, let your hair hang down

9
00:00:58,804 --> 00:01:01,386
 Evie, Evie

10
00:01:01,557 --> 00:01:03,798
 Evie, let your hair hang down

11
00:01:03,976 --> 00:01:06,718
 Evie, Evie

12
00:01:06,896 --> 00:01:09,387
 Evie, let your hair hang down

13
00:01:09,565 --> 00:01:12,432
 Evie, Evie

14
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:15,942
 Let your hair hang... 

15
00:01:45,476 --> 00:01:47,216
Bring him in.
Bring him in.

16
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:49,636
Through here. Just get him in.

17
00:01:49,814 --> 00:01:51,395
Alright, uh...

18
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:56,767
OK, sit down.
OK, OK

19
00:01:56,946 --> 00:01:59,813
Hold his head! You have
to keep his bloody head still!

20
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,446
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, you!

21
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:03,949
We've gotta get a clean

22
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:13,872
Uh, no .. Yeah, no worries

23
00:02:16,674 --> 00:02:18,130
What is his beef, huh?

24
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,669
Doesn't matter
I can't do it anwyay.

25
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:25,463
I can't shoot a mate.

26
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,515
What can I get you, mate?

27
00:02:35,693 --> 00:02:39,026
Uh just a beer thanks.

28
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:43,947
So, what's wrong with the dog?

29
00:02:44,118 --> 00:02:47,030
Oh, baited strychnine.

30
00:02:48,622 --> 00:02:51,659
Why would anyone
'want to poison a dog?

31
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:55,292
Maybe someone set it out
for the roos or the dingoes

32
00:02:55,463 --> 00:02:57,328
or someone just doesn't
like dogs, you know?

33
00:02:57,506 --> 00:03:01,670
There are people, sick people.

34
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:03,209
Sorry.

35
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:04,888
Are you his master?

36
00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:09,424
No, no. He has no master.
Well, not now.

37
00:03:09,602 --> 00:03:11,433
That s not just any dog
In there, you know?

38
00:03:11,604 --> 00:03:13,435
No?
Oh no, no

39
00:03:13,606 --> 00:03:15,562
No, no, he's a famous dog.

40
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:18,099
He's probably the most
famous dog in all Australia.

41
00:03:20,196 --> 00:03:22,152
Red Dog.

42
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:24,609
Yeah, the one that warned
those people about that fire.

43
00:03:24,783 --> 00:03:25,989
No no, no.

44
00:03:27,036 --> 00:03:28,526
The one that saved that child.

45
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:31,946
No, no, not him. Wrong dog.

46
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:33,830
Didn't he...
No, no, no, no.

47
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,287
Look, mate, you're looking
at it all the wrong way

48
00:03:36,462 --> 00:03:39,920
It s, uh.
It's not what he did.

49
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,751
lt's who he was.

50
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:43,507
Is, I mean.

51
00:03:43,677 --> 00:03:45,053
Red Dog?

52
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:46,882
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah.

53
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:49,217
Vet's coming.

54
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:51,052
Yeah? When?
Soon.

55
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:53,764
How's the poor thing doing?

56
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:07,951
Oh, l'm sorry, mate
Jack Collins, publican.

57
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:09,779
Thomas Baker, trucker.

58
00:04:09,954 --> 00:04:12,036
Yeah, yeah.

59
00:04:12,206 --> 00:04:15,619
It was me that brought Red Dog
to Dampier, me and Maureen,

60
00:04:15,793 --> 00:04:18,079
near on 10 years ago now,

61
00:04:18,254 --> 00:04:19,790
back in the mean old days

62
00:04:19,964 --> 00:04:25,880
when men were men
and dogs were... dogs,

63
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:28,965
rougher, hotter,

64
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:32,051
brighter, redder.

65
00:04:35,354 --> 00:04:39,017
Why would anybody
build a town out here?

66
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:42,274
Why would anyone live
in a town built out here?

67
00:04:42,444 --> 00:04:44,981
I know. Money.

68
00:04:45,155 --> 00:04:47,282
Yeah, I know that.

69
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:53,786
What's that?
What's what?

70
00:04:53,956 --> 00:04:56,322
On the road.

71
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:08,213
It's a dog.

72
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:11,299
I can see that.

73
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:13,088
What's it doing out here?

74
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:26,738
Hello, boy!

75
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:29,396
Hey? Hello.

76
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:34,069
Hello. Aren't you
a pretty boy, hey?

77
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:35,986
Hello.

78
00:05:36,165 --> 00:05:38,531
Are you lost?

79
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:41,166
Do you need water?

80
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:51,502
Cheeky bastard.

81
00:05:58,437 --> 00:06:00,393
Struth!

82
00:06:00,564 --> 00:06:02,304
Is that the dog?

83
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:05,190
Well, it's certainly
not me! Eugh!

84
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:08,398
Ohh! Oh, Lord
what did that thing eat?

85
00:06:08,572 --> 00:06:12,030
Stop the car
I can't breathe! Ohh

86
00:06:15,371 --> 00:06:18,078
Eugh!

87
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:21,706
Oh...

88
00:06:21,877 --> 00:06:24,209
Oh this is like... Wow.

89
00:06:31,428 --> 00:06:32,463
Ohh!

90
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:36,690
Ohh!

91
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:39,281
Hey, Maureen, Maureen.
Come and have a ook at this.

92
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:44,657
Oh, that poor little bugger.

93
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:49,294
Oh!

94
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,516
Oh, g'day, Rick.
He's out the back, mate.

95
00:08:03,687 --> 00:08:06,053
Thanks.
Hey, Rick.

96
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:09,560
That's the vet.

97
00:08:16,825 --> 00:08:18,361
Here you go, Vanno.

98
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:21,527
Hey.
Vanno, this is Tommy boy.

99
00:08:21,705 --> 00:08:23,787
I've just been telling him
about Red Dog.

100
00:08:23,957 --> 00:08:26,994
Vanno here's one of his first
mates from back in the days.

101
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:28,830
Yes, 'the days'.

102
00:08:29,004 --> 00:08:30,505
Wild days?

103
00:08:30,672 --> 00:08:35,086
Very wild, very lonely.

104
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:40,596
A dog of a certain type
can do well in a lonely town.

105
00:08:40,766 --> 00:08:42,222
I know.

106
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:46,931
I come from a small little
Village in Italy - Abruzzi.

107
00:08:47,105 --> 00:08:48,891
Here we go.

108
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:50,351
Ohh!

109
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:53,484
Yes, yes, you all bloat,

110
00:08:53,654 --> 00:08:56,145
but my little Village
was beautiful.

111
00:08:56,323 --> 00:09:00,657
In spring, flowers
are like Turkish carpet

112
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:04,161
and the wine would
make you see the Virgin.

113
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:06,913
Why did you leave?

114
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,248
Same as all these
fools, money!

115
00:09:11,421 --> 00:09:13,127
We all follow the money.

116
00:09:13,298 --> 00:09:14,674
They come from everywhere.

117
00:09:14,842 --> 00:09:16,378
From all the countries,
they come

118
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:18,338
for the money,
for the work.

119
00:09:18,512 --> 00:09:21,629
From Poland, New Zealand,

120
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:23,172
Ireland, Greece,

121
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,557
Latvia, America.

122
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:27,263
Even Melbourne.

123
00:09:27,437 --> 00:09:30,099
Living together,
eating together

124
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:32,356
and crapping together.

125
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:34,938
Money crackpot.

126
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:38,445
They may look normal,
but not normal.

127
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:42,153
Sun has burned out
their brains.

128
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:45,535
See, I know sun
in Italy, in Abruzzi,

129
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:48,823
but I not know the sun
until I come here.

130
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:51,162
Very dangerous, this sun.

131
00:09:52,212 --> 00:09:55,249
I knew a man, Goran.
Remember Goran?

132
00:10:00,637 --> 00:10:02,969
The sun, it kill him.

133
00:10:05,976 --> 00:10:09,184
And also Sam.
Remember Sam-Man?

134
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:12,972
He work in the sun
for five hours without no hat.

135
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,515
Fool!

136
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:17,184
Afterward he spoke
Chinese for two days.

137
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:25,742
Before the sun, he know
not a word of Chinese!

138
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,749
Yes, it was crazy place when
Red Dog arrive in Dampier.

139
00:10:41,178 --> 00:10:43,043
Men are no better
than wild animals.

140
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:47,260
They drink much and they...
How do you say? 'Imbulge'.

141
00:10:47,434 --> 00:10:49,766
And their hair, it goes funny.

142
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:51,427
 All day, all night

143
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:54,017
 You know,
I've been working hard

144
00:10:54,191 --> 00:10:56,432
 All day, all night

145
00:11:04,326 --> 00:11:05,907
 Gather around, y'all
It's about time you learnt

146
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:07,909
 About the new dance craze
that's sweeping the world... 

147
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,571
If that thing could flap...

148
00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:12,364
...it might just fly away.

149
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:26,424
You two... be needing
an ed-u-cation.

150
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:27,633
A what?

151
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:30,140
Arggh!

152
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,096
Ohh!

153
00:11:37,859 --> 00:11:39,770
Though not all imbulge.

154
00:11:39,945 --> 00:11:43,187
Some were quiet, educated,

155
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:45,071
with dark, mysterious past.

156
00:11:48,912 --> 00:11:51,574
Some that never, ever laugh.

157
00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:56,082
In Abruzzi, no-one would
fight over moustache.

158
00:11:57,129 --> 00:11:58,960
What do they fight over?

159
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:03,081
Women!

160
00:12:05,762 --> 00:12:09,505
Abruzzi has the most
beautiful women in Italy.

161
00:12:09,683 --> 00:12:14,097
Slender, with a wonderful
breast, like a nut.

162
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:17,304
Nuts?

163
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:22,567
Yes! Big, beautiful nut!

164
00:12:22,738 --> 00:12:25,946
To come from a place
with such beautiful women

165
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:28,528
to a place with no women...

166
00:12:28,702 --> 00:12:31,614
I don't think you can
understand such pain.

167
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:40,335
In Abruzzi,
the sky is very blue,

168
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:42,211
like, uh...

169
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:44,338
...like the sky of Abruzzi.

170
00:12:54,853 --> 00:12:57,094
ln Abruzzi, the sea...

171
00:12:57,272 --> 00:12:59,479
Arggh!

172
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:05,023
Oi! Oi!

173
00:13:07,532 --> 00:13:09,443
Barry Wright to main office, please.

174
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:11,154
Barry Wright.

175
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:17,869
We took a vote,
and the shop steward agrees.

176
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:19,908
If you don't stop
talking about 'Bruzki'...

177
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:22,248
Abruzzi!

178
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:25,505
The Ski Patrol have
permission to slit your throat.

179
00:13:28,303 --> 00:13:30,385
Sorry.

180
00:13:35,143 --> 00:13:37,259
Everyone's homesick.

181
00:13:39,272 --> 00:13:41,388
Not you?

182
00:13:43,944 --> 00:13:46,526
Need a home to be
homesick, mate.

183
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:33,489
You alone too, Mr Doggie?

184
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:37,910
But you are happy, no?

185
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,623
You have a gift, Mr Doggie.

186
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:45,877
I do not.

187
00:14:53,597 --> 00:14:55,303
Have you ever heard of Abruzzi?

188
00:14:57,434 --> 00:15:00,096
Abruzzi has the best
fishing in Italy...

189
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,433
 Oh, baby, don't you know
that I love you so?

190
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:06,144
 Bom, bom, bom, bom

191
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:10,311
 Baby, don't you know
 Bom, bom, bom, bom

192
00:15:10,488 --> 00:15:12,900
 That I love you so?
 Bom, bom... 

193
00:15:13,074 --> 00:15:14,689
What can I say?

194
00:15:14,868 --> 00:15:17,359
He was an excellent listener

195
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:20,824
He did not judge.

196
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:23,991
A polite doggie,
a very loyal doggie.

197
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:25,534
Or so I thought.

198
00:15:25,712 --> 00:15:27,577
 Bom, bom, bom, bom

199
00:15:27,756 --> 00:15:29,621
 Baby, can't you see... 

200
00:15:32,427 --> 00:15:35,009
 That you were meant for me?
 Bom, bom... 

201
00:15:41,228 --> 00:15:43,139
Betrayal!

202
00:15:43,313 --> 00:15:44,428
Hey!

203
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:53,562
What are you doing?
Nothing,

204
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,322
Are you talking to my dog?
Your dog?

205
00:15:56,493 --> 00:15:58,734
How is he your dog?
I talk to him first.

206
00:15:58,912 --> 00:16:00,277
That doesn't make him
your dog, mate.

207
00:16:00,455 --> 00:16:02,116
That just makes you weird.

208
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,202
If I am weird
then you are more weird.

209
00:16:05,377 --> 00:16:07,959
Not likely.
I feed him steak!

210
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:09,869
Well, what do you think
I'm feeding him? Broccoli?

211
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:11,584
Dog robber

212
00:16:13,093 --> 00:16:16,301
Alright, then.
Why don't we let him decide?

213
00:16:16,471 --> 00:16:19,713
Good.
Let him decide!

214
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:22,803
Whose doggie are you?

215
00:16:24,145 --> 00:16:26,727
Give us a kiss.

216
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:32,058
Good boy! How you going?

217
00:16:32,237 --> 00:16:33,943
Oh, you're a good boy, Red Dog.

218
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:37,197
You little Red Dog, aren't ya?
Aren't ya a good boy?

219
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:41,781
He was like that,
a dog for everyone.

220
00:16:41,955 --> 00:16:43,866
Come here, boy!

221
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,416
Come here, boy.

222
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:46,959
Here, Red. Here.

223
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:49,459
Good boy! Come here.

224
00:16:51,965 --> 00:16:56,584
Yes, for everyone,
but no-one in particular.

225
00:16:59,431 --> 00:17:02,389
All those in favour
of Red Dog joining the TWU

226
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,097
under the job heading
con...consu...

227
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:08,262
Consulari.
Whatever.

228
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,522
All those in favour, say ''Aye.''

229
00:17:10,692 --> 00:17:12,648
Aye.

230
00:17:14,404 --> 00:17:16,861
Yes, a union doggie,

231
00:17:17,032 --> 00:17:18,772
a doggie for all.

232
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,487
That is, until he met
his true master.

233
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:23,947
Johnny!
Yeah, Johnny!

234
00:17:24,122 --> 00:17:25,783
Johnny boy!
Johnny Boy!

235
00:17:37,802 --> 00:17:39,383
 Now listen

236
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:42,838
 Oh, we're stepping out

237
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:47,176
 I'm gonna turn around

238
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,188
 Gonna turn around once
and we'll do the Eagle Rock

239
00:17:53,443 --> 00:17:55,900
 Whoa, mamma

240
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:58,653
 Oh, your rocking swell

241
00:17:59,699 --> 00:18:01,690
 Hmm, yeah, you do it so well

242
00:18:03,912 --> 00:18:08,030
 Well, we do it so well
when we do the Eagle Rock

243
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,744
 Mamma, oh!

244
00:18:11,044 --> 00:18:14,081
 Yeah, you're rocking fine

245
00:18:14,255 --> 00:18:17,622
 Why don't you give me a sign?

246
00:18:18,676 --> 00:18:23,386
 Hmm, just give me a sign
and we'll do the Eagle Rock

247
00:18:23,556 --> 00:18:24,932
 Hey, hey, hey

248
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,968
 Good old Eagle Rock's
here to stay

249
00:18:29,145 --> 00:18:32,763
 I'm just crazy
'bout the way we move

250
00:18:32,941 --> 00:18:37,025
 Doing the Eagle Rock... 

251
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:43,151
Good morning.

252
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:50,124
Bloody Americans.

253
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:19,105
Hey!

254
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:43,750
Did you see that?
Red Dog.

255
00:19:43,928 --> 00:19:46,544
He almost got run over.
Nah, he was hitchhiking, mate.

256
00:19:46,723 --> 00:19:48,588
That was hitchhiking?

257
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:51,098
Once you pick him up,
he remembers

258
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:55,182
and thinks it's his right
to demand a ride any time.

259
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:57,267
Pushy bloke.
no doubt about it.

260
00:19:57,442 --> 00:19:59,478
What? He only does that
to people that he knows?

261
00:19:59,652 --> 00:20:02,064
Of course not.
Just the ones he likes.

262
00:20:06,326 --> 00:20:08,908
 You can climb a mountain

263
00:20:10,246 --> 00:20:12,328
 You can swim a sea

264
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:16,116
 You can jump into the fire

265
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:18,410
 But you'll never be free... 

266
00:20:19,964 --> 00:20:22,376
 You can shake me up

267
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,257
 Or I can break you down

268
00:20:26,804 --> 00:20:29,967
 Whoa, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

269
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:31,642
 Whoa, oh-oh, oh-oh ... 

270
00:20:50,078 --> 00:20:52,410
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?!

271
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,447
Go on, get off my bike.
Go on, go on. Get!

272
00:21:05,843 --> 00:21:08,801
The world is a funny place, no?

273
00:21:08,972 --> 00:21:12,760
Sometimes you pick your dog.

274
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:15,175
Sometimes your dog picks you.

275
00:21:15,353 --> 00:21:16,889
 Our love is alive

276
00:21:18,982 --> 00:21:21,314
 And so we begin

277
00:21:22,944 --> 00:21:26,607
 Foolishly laying
our hearts on the table

278
00:21:26,781 --> 00:21:28,737
 Stumblin' in

279
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:32,776
 Our love is a flame

280
00:21:34,247 --> 00:21:36,112
 Burning within... 

281
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:39,949
No dogs on the bus.

282
00:21:41,462 --> 00:21:43,748
 Stumblin' in

283
00:21:45,008 --> 00:21:47,374
 Wherever you go

284
00:21:49,012 --> 00:21:51,219
 Whatever you do

285
00:21:52,265 --> 00:21:55,928
 You know these reckless
thoughts of mine

286
00:21:56,102 --> 00:21:58,309
 Are following you

287
00:22:00,023 --> 00:22:02,059
 I've fallen for you

288
00:22:03,526 --> 00:22:05,767
 Whatever you do

289
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,818
 'Cause, baby,
you've shown me so many things

290
00:22:10,992 --> 00:22:13,278
 That I never knew

291
00:22:14,746 --> 00:22:17,533
 Whatever it takes

292
00:22:17,707 --> 00:22:20,414
 Baby. I'll do it for you... 

293
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,001
All the sad faces in the world
won't work,

294
00:22:24,172 --> 00:22:25,708
so you can just stop.

295
00:22:29,802 --> 00:22:33,636
 Foolishly laying
our hearts on the table

296
00:22:33,806 --> 00:22:35,467
 Stumblin' in

297
00:22:36,517 --> 00:22:39,224
 Our love is a flame

298
00:22:40,897 --> 00:22:43,183
 Burning within

299
00:22:45,151 --> 00:22:48,484
 Now and then
firelight will catch us

300
00:22:48,655 --> 00:22:50,520
 Stumblin' in... 

301
00:23:02,168 --> 00:23:03,829
Ready?
OK, five.

302
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:06,836
In for five.

303
00:23:08,257 --> 00:23:11,169
Ready? Quiet!

304
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:16,254
GO!

305
00:23:16,432 --> 00:23:19,424
Eat, eat, eat, eat,
eat, eat, eat!

306
00:23:33,449 --> 00:23:36,111
9.2 seconds! A new world record!

307
00:23:38,371 --> 00:23:40,157
No!
Oh-ho-ho!

308
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,872
What's next? What's next?

309
00:23:47,505 --> 00:23:49,245
A chicken!

310
00:23:49,424 --> 00:23:51,380
Why wouldn't he eat a chicken?

311
00:23:53,094 --> 00:23:55,255
A live chicken!

312
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:13,231
Enough!

313
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:18,570
I won't let Red Dog eat a live
chicken for your sick amusement.

314
00:24:18,745 --> 00:24:22,237
What's it to you, huh?
It's not your dog.

315
00:24:22,415 --> 00:24:24,906
No chicken, mate.

316
00:24:27,295 --> 00:24:30,162
Says who?
I do,

317
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:32,250
Ooh!

318
00:24:38,723 --> 00:24:41,180
Fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight!

319
00:24:46,189 --> 00:24:47,679
OK, OK!

320
00:24:47,857 --> 00:24:50,690
No chicken, no chicken.

321
00:24:54,781 --> 00:24:56,567
Red Dog, come!

322
00:25:09,504 --> 00:25:11,586
Huh?

323
00:25:28,523 --> 00:25:30,354
Come on, boy.
We ride together now.

324
00:25:42,036 --> 00:25:47,156
And from that day on
Red Dog had a master,

325
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:50,825
the only master
he would ever have.

326
00:25:58,928 --> 00:26:01,010
Hey, but enough said
about that.

327
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,557
Hey, quiet! Quiet! Shh!
Turn the jukebox off.

328
00:26:03,724 --> 00:26:08,013
Uh...to tell you the truth,
I should put him down.

329
00:26:08,187 --> 00:26:10,178
But he's a strong old dog

330
00:26:10,356 --> 00:26:12,438
and God knows
he deserves a last fight

331
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,394
so l've given him some
anticonvulsants,

332
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:16,355
he's resting easier.

333
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:20,067
We wait. Hopefully, he'll
make it through the night.

334
00:26:35,172 --> 00:26:37,163
Come on, Red Dog

335
00:26:40,219 --> 00:26:42,175
Poor Red.

336
00:26:43,472 --> 00:26:45,849
What are we gonna
do with you, huh?

337
00:26:50,021 --> 00:26:53,138
A shame, that is.
Yeah.

338
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:56,565
There's a lot
of history there, you know,

339
00:26:56,736 --> 00:26:59,944
with Nancy, John, Red Dog.

340
00:27:36,984 --> 00:27:38,019
Down!

341
00:27:39,737 --> 00:27:41,728
Bad dog!

342
00:27:45,534 --> 00:27:47,149
You'll never get him
out of there, Miss.

343
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,239
No-one sit there
when Red sit there.

344
00:27:56,921 --> 00:27:59,207
Ohh!

345
00:27:59,382 --> 00:28:01,668
Well, aren't you
a charmer, huh?

346
00:28:03,803 --> 00:28:05,919
Stop that!

347
00:28:08,265 --> 00:28:09,880
Bad dog!

348
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:11,890
Hang on, Miss. Hang on!

349
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:13,426
Ever since he became
a union member

350
00:28:13,604 --> 00:28:15,014
he thinks he's got rights.

351
00:28:16,565 --> 00:28:19,978
I'm not moving, so you'll
just have to put up with me.

352
00:28:21,737 --> 00:28:24,945
Stop that! Now, be
a gentleman and move over!

353
00:28:25,992 --> 00:28:28,108
Now!
Ooh.

354
00:28:58,149 --> 00:28:59,639
Hello.

355
00:28:59,817 --> 00:29:01,478
Hello.

356
00:29:01,652 --> 00:29:04,029
You're sharing a seat
with my dog.

357
00:29:05,072 --> 00:29:06,448
Yes, I am.

358
00:29:08,117 --> 00:29:09,698
Wow!

359
00:29:24,884 --> 00:29:28,968
So, what will you be
doing at Hamersley, Nancy?

360
00:29:29,138 --> 00:29:30,503
A secretary.

361
00:29:31,891 --> 00:29:33,973
Quite a change from Perth.

362
00:29:34,143 --> 00:29:35,508
An adventure, to be sure.

363
00:29:35,686 --> 00:29:39,019
That's a good way
to look at it, an adventure.

364
00:29:42,151 --> 00:29:44,062
Is alright yet?
Don't wanna be too late.

365
00:29:44,236 --> 00:29:46,318
Give it another minute or two
to air out, boys.

366
00:29:46,489 --> 00:29:48,730
Wouldn't want anyone
to get sick from the fumes.

367
00:29:55,581 --> 00:29:58,789
So, Nancy, there's a new movie
playing at the open-air.

368
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,620
Would you like
to come and see it?

369
00:30:00,795 --> 00:30:03,628
What's it about?

370
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:06,164
Uh, I can't remember.

371
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:10,885
Alright, then,

372
00:30:15,518 --> 00:30:17,759
Still 'rip'.
'Ripe'?

373
00:30:17,937 --> 00:30:22,226
Yes, the rip is very ripe.

374
00:30:27,571 --> 00:30:29,653
Oh, yeah?

375
00:30:32,701 --> 00:30:33,827
Hi, John.

376
00:30:33,994 --> 00:30:35,370
Uh, I need to borrow the wagon

377
00:30:35,538 --> 00:30:37,654
so I can take the new girl
to the movies.

378
00:30:37,832 --> 00:30:39,868
What makes you think
that she'd be interested

379
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:42,078
in a skinny
little Yank like you

380
00:30:42,253 --> 00:30:44,790
when she's got us
proper blokes around?

381
00:30:44,964 --> 00:30:47,000
I bathe.

382
00:30:47,174 --> 00:30:49,039
Also, do you think
you could watch Red?

383
00:30:49,218 --> 00:30:52,961
I think he's a touch...
...J-E-A-L-O-U-S.

384
00:30:54,348 --> 00:30:55,713
J-E-what?

385
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:58,803
Jealous.
Oh! Huh?

386
00:30:58,978 --> 00:31:01,594
Pfft! No troubles.

387
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:03,148
We'll have
a right party, we will.

388
00:31:03,315 --> 00:31:06,102
Won't we, Red?
Thanks, Peet. See ya, Red.

389
00:31:06,277 --> 00:31:08,438
Get ready to get wild.

390
00:31:12,575 --> 00:31:15,032
 Jeepers, creepers

391
00:31:15,202 --> 00:31:17,113
 Where'd you get
those peepers?

392
00:31:17,288 --> 00:31:19,495
 Jeepers, creepers

393
00:31:19,665 --> 00:31:21,621
 Where'd you get those eyes? 

394
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:23,202
This one's a beauty.

395
00:31:23,377 --> 00:31:25,834
lt's called
the fisherman's rib.

396
00:31:26,005 --> 00:31:27,916
Lovely, don't you think?

397
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,206
You play your cards right

398
00:31:30,384 --> 00:31:33,376
and I can make you
a sweater with four legs.

399
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,295
 Woe is me

400
00:31:36,473 --> 00:31:39,636
 Got to put my cheaters on
Jeepers, creepers... 

401
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,186
Where do you think
you're going?

402
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,471
Ohh...

403
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:58,484
Yo!

404
00:32:00,748 --> 00:32:02,329
We're going to the pub.

405
00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:04,410
I can't.

406
00:32:04,585 --> 00:32:07,042
I'm watching Red Dog
for Johnny boy.

407
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:10,959
What is in his mouth?

408
00:32:12,218 --> 00:32:15,005
Hey! Give me that.

409
00:32:18,474 --> 00:32:21,591
Bring back my bloody yarn!

410
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:24,476
Red! Red!

411
00:32:50,881 --> 00:32:52,257
Hello, kitty.

412
00:32:52,424 --> 00:32:53,960
Whoa,

413
00:32:54,134 --> 00:32:57,217
Hey, hey. Go on, take off.

414
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:01,672
Red Cat was
an horrendous animal, no?

415
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,136
He was - how do you say? -

416
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:07,769
a destroyer of many pooches.

417
00:33:12,778 --> 00:33:14,814
Hey, what are you
doing to my cat?

418
00:33:14,989 --> 00:33:17,355
Nothing. I...

419
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:18,898
What's going on?

420
00:33:19,076 --> 00:33:21,943
Oh, this cat tried to attack me.
It must smell Red Dog on me.

421
00:33:22,121 --> 00:33:24,453
Visitors have to park
on the road. It's a rule.

422
00:33:24,623 --> 00:33:26,488
Sorry, Mr Cribbage.

423
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:28,749
Rules are rules, Miss Grey.

424
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:30,750
With all the riffraff
the company's hiring

425
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:34,084
It's only rules that
separate us from the animals.

426
00:33:37,011 --> 00:33:38,547
Goodnight, Mr Cribbage.

427
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,755
He's the caretaker of the park.

428
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:44,673
I'm trying not to get
on his bad side.

429
00:33:44,852 --> 00:33:47,218
Does he have a good side?

430
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,812
There you are.
Thank you.

431
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:57,645
Turn your bloody
lights off, ya nongs!

432
00:34:06,707 --> 00:34:08,698
Shh!

433
00:34:15,049 --> 00:34:17,210
Oh, geez!

434
00:34:18,594 --> 00:34:20,960
Ohh!

435
00:34:21,138 --> 00:34:23,925
Oi! I can't see:

436
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:25,555
What the hell is that?

437
00:34:25,726 --> 00:34:27,967
Hide. It's my dog.

438
00:34:44,745 --> 00:34:46,861
Ohh!

439
00:35:13,065 --> 00:35:19,186
You, dog, be needing
an ed-u-cation.

440
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:26,992
Hey, can I show you something?

441
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:35,659
Careful.

442
00:35:38,841 --> 00:35:42,379
So a few years back,
this old dude, Jumbo Smelt,

443
00:35:42,553 --> 00:35:43,918
'Was swimming right out there

444
00:35:44,096 --> 00:35:45,802
and he got attacked
by a great white.

445
00:35:45,973 --> 00:35:48,555
Bit him in the leg
and pulled him under.

446
00:35:48,725 --> 00:35:50,852
Did he die?
No, no.

447
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:53,806
The shark spat him out,
didn't like the way he tasted.

448
00:35:53,981 --> 00:35:56,017
Not a surprise
if you knew Jumbo.

449
00:35:56,191 --> 00:36:00,025
It took 73 stitches to get
his leg sewed back together.

450
00:36:00,195 --> 00:36:01,605
That's awful.

451
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,441
Hey, no-one swims
out there anymore.

452
00:36:03,615 --> 00:36:06,527
Most days you can still see the
shark swimming back and forth.

453
00:36:07,578 --> 00:36:10,365
He's been spotted so often
the boys have given him a name.

454
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:14,248
Mmm?
Lord Nelson.

455
00:36:22,593 --> 00:36:24,458
I don't see anything.

456
00:36:25,512 --> 00:36:28,128
Maybe we should
go out a bit deeper.

457
00:36:35,189 --> 00:36:36,895
What's that?
What?!

458
00:36:37,065 --> 00:36:39,351
Nothing.
It's not funny!

459
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:45,108
Maybe he's asleep.

460
00:36:47,993 --> 00:36:49,949
Sharks don't sleep.

461
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,784
They have to keep moving,
just like you,

462
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:58,621
Mr Never Lived More Than
Two Years in the Same Place.

463
00:36:58,795 --> 00:37:01,377
Are you calling me a shark?
Maybe.

464
00:37:01,548 --> 00:37:03,413
Nah, you got me wrong.

465
00:37:03,592 --> 00:37:05,423
Moving is part
of my romantic nature.

466
00:37:05,594 --> 00:37:07,130
Hmm.

467
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,761
You're just scared.

468
00:37:09,932 --> 00:37:11,342
Scared? Of what?

469
00:37:12,392 --> 00:37:15,805
Of finding something worth
staying in one place for.

470
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:38,407
 I left the keys in the car

471
00:37:38,585 --> 00:37:40,496
 I left the door ajar

472
00:37:40,671 --> 00:37:42,502
 I didn't want to be alone

473
00:37:42,673 --> 00:37:44,755
 These are the days
and the nights

474
00:37:44,925 --> 00:37:46,711
 At these sweet
humbling heights

475
00:37:46,885 --> 00:37:49,001
 And I know
it used to be home... 

476
00:37:50,806 --> 00:37:53,673
 Well, whisk me away
I'll be yours for a day

477
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,556
 In heavenly fields
we can roam... 

478
00:37:57,104 --> 00:38:00,562
 Whoa, oh, oh
You're my clean white love

479
00:38:00,732 --> 00:38:03,815
 Whoa, oh, oh
You're my clean white love

480
00:38:03,986 --> 00:38:06,272
 What are you doing?
What are you doing?

481
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:07,947
 What are ya doing to me?

482
00:38:08,115 --> 00:38:10,197
 What are you doing
to my head?

483
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:14,360
 Whoa, oh, oh
You're my clean white love

484
00:38:14,538 --> 00:38:17,905
 Whoa, oh, oh
You're too clean white love

485
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,493
 I give my heart
on the morning... 

486
00:38:19,668 --> 00:38:21,078
Really?

487
00:38:22,754 --> 00:38:25,621
 Everybody's
looking for a fix, hey

488
00:38:31,054 --> 00:38:32,590
 Sell me a sign

489
00:38:32,764 --> 00:38:34,595
 I'll cut the telephone line

490
00:38:34,766 --> 00:38:37,223
 Just to keep
expectations alive... 

491
00:38:37,394 --> 00:38:40,807
Hello, Red. Hello! Come on. Up.

492
00:38:40,981 --> 00:38:42,346
 The feeling is blind

493
00:38:42,524 --> 00:38:45,061
 Though I climbed up
You're looking divine

494
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:47,191
 Sell me it straight... 

495
00:38:47,362 --> 00:38:49,569
Red Dog! Red!

496
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,072
 Keep on breaking
the rules, ohh

497
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:55,609
 Whoa, oh, oh
You're my clean white love

498
00:38:55,787 --> 00:38:59,029
 Whoa, oh, oh
You're too clean white love

499
00:38:59,207 --> 00:39:01,289
 What are you doing?
What are you doing?

500
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,825
 What are ya doing to me?

501
00:39:03,003 --> 00:39:05,369
 What are you doing
to my head?

502
00:39:05,547 --> 00:39:09,256
 Whoa, oh, oh
You're my clean white love

503
00:39:09,426 --> 00:39:12,759
 Whoa, oh, oh,
you're too clean... 

504
00:39:15,515 --> 00:39:18,803
Yep, Red was a real
matchmaker, alright.

505
00:39:18,977 --> 00:39:22,515
Red Dog is reason
I met my most bella wife.

506
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:26,398
Do you remember? It was
the day Red Dog was shot.

507
00:39:26,568 --> 00:39:28,684
Red Dog was shot?
Oh, yes,

508
00:39:28,862 --> 00:39:32,195
After his first
great fight with Red Cat.

509
00:39:32,366 --> 00:39:34,448
Why would anyone shoot him?
Because he won

510
00:39:34,618 --> 00:39:37,405
No, he did not win
his first fight with Red Cat,

511
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:40,696
but Red Dog was not
a normal poochie.

512
00:39:40,874 --> 00:39:44,082
He was smart, very, very smart,

513
00:39:44,252 --> 00:39:45,913
and brave.

514
00:40:14,116 --> 00:40:16,653
Get out! Get! You diety,
filthy, whoring hound!

515
00:40:34,886 --> 00:40:36,342
Johnny boy!
Yeah?

516
00:40:36,513 --> 00:40:38,094
Phone.

517
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:43,728
Hello.

518
00:40:43,895 --> 00:40:45,556
He's over here!

519
00:40:49,151 --> 00:40:51,392
Hey, buddy. Hey.

520
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,526
Oh, what have they done to you?

521
00:40:56,241 --> 00:40:58,732
Ohh. What do you think?

522
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,697
I can stop the bleeding, but
'we have to get him to a vet.

523
00:41:01,872 --> 00:41:03,237
That's four hours.

524
00:41:03,415 --> 00:41:05,371
Three and a half, mate,
the way I drive.

525
00:41:11,089 --> 00:41:13,705
Don't you dare die on me,
you damn dog.

526
00:41:13,884 --> 00:41:15,795
Don't you dare die.

527
00:41:15,969 --> 00:41:18,506
You're OK.

528
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,636
So, who do you think did it?

529
00:41:20,807 --> 00:41:22,638
Evil Cribbages.

530
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:26,176
They live on pig snouts
and they hate the doggies.

531
00:41:26,354 --> 00:41:28,640
What makes you think
he has a rifle?

532
00:41:28,815 --> 00:41:31,602
I know.
How do you know that?

533
00:41:31,777 --> 00:41:33,688
After Jumbo Smelt
was eaten in the leg

534
00:41:33,862 --> 00:41:35,398
all the men with gun...

535
00:41:38,158 --> 00:41:39,864
...went out to kill the sharky.

536
00:41:40,035 --> 00:41:42,822
I'm glad they didn't kill it.

537
00:41:42,996 --> 00:41:44,361
Why?

538
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:46,404
You never know when
you might need a shark.

539
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:51,077
What in God's red earth
would you need a shark for?

540
00:41:51,254 --> 00:41:53,791
Say you woke up
one fine morning

541
00:41:53,965 --> 00:41:55,921
and didn't find it so fine.

542
00:41:56,092 --> 00:41:59,334
Being eaten by a shark is
rather a memorabie way to go.

543
00:41:59,513 --> 00:42:04,007
You would not taik this way
if you laugh once in a while.

544
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,425
I laugh.

545
00:42:06,603 --> 00:42:08,468
Never.
He's right, mate.

546
00:42:08,647 --> 00:42:10,854
I've never even
heard you chuckle.

547
00:42:11,024 --> 00:42:12,389
Maybe you haven't noticed,

548
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:14,819
but Dampier's no three-ring
bloody circus, is it?

549
00:42:14,986 --> 00:42:17,898
In my home Village of Abruzzi

550
00:42:18,073 --> 00:42:21,281
there was always
laughter, always.

551
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:23,032
I don't even think
there is an Abruzzi.

552
00:42:23,203 --> 00:42:25,410
You probably come from some
piss-ugly town in Albania

553
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,116
and are trying to pass.

554
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:29,326
Vannoski!

555
00:42:29,501 --> 00:42:31,787
That is not funny.

556
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,626
Yuri Vannoski.

557
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,165
Dimitri Vannoski.

558
00:42:40,637 --> 00:42:41,672
Knitter.

559
00:42:43,223 --> 00:42:45,179
What did you call me?
I called you a knitter!

560
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,341
What kind of a man
knits a sweater?

561
00:42:51,523 --> 00:42:55,766
Shut up! Give Red Dog
some peace, for Godsakes!

562
00:42:57,821 --> 00:43:00,483
It's OK. It'll be OK.

563
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:09,242
Well, he got lucky.

564
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:11,452
The bullets missed the bone.

565
00:43:11,626 --> 00:43:13,366
I saved them for you.

566
00:43:14,421 --> 00:43:16,833
Well, look at that.

567
00:43:18,592 --> 00:43:21,550
How long will he need to stay?
Just a coup e of hours.

568
00:43:28,602 --> 00:43:30,809
It's my shout, boys.

569
00:43:43,325 --> 00:43:44,861
You alright?

570
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,616
Red's gonna need
to come back in two weeks.

571
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,530
That's a long bloody drive.
Yeah.

572
00:43:52,709 --> 00:43:54,700
I could try and take
the stitches out for you.

573
00:43:54,878 --> 00:43:56,994
No.

574
00:43:57,172 --> 00:43:59,128
l will take him.

575
00:43:59,299 --> 00:44:02,211
It would be an honour.

576
00:44:21,404 --> 00:44:23,781
Idiota, Idiota, Idiota!

577
00:44:27,661 --> 00:44:29,868
His nose, it is, uh, very dry.

578
00:44:30,038 --> 00:44:32,245
I cannot sleep.

579
00:44:37,379 --> 00:44:39,620
Yes, a worm.

580
00:44:39,798 --> 00:44:41,959
A big white worm.

581
00:44:51,768 --> 00:44:54,885
l am sorry they give you
enema last time.

582
00:44:55,063 --> 00:44:57,896
This time I promise
to ask her out.

583
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:03,568
OK, OK, OK.

584
00:45:06,408 --> 00:45:10,526
I ask her out
and give you big meat, huh?

585
00:45:10,704 --> 00:45:13,195
No. After.

586
00:45:21,381 --> 00:45:23,167
I can't see any glass.

587
00:45:25,301 --> 00:45:29,635
I wonder, you know, sometime,

588
00:45:29,806 --> 00:45:34,345
I and you together maybe...

589
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:36,635
Are you asking me out?

590
00:45:40,025 --> 00:45:41,731
I do.

591
00:45:41,901 --> 00:45:43,687
Arggh!

592
00:45:49,659 --> 00:45:51,650
Well?

593
00:45:53,288 --> 00:45:57,281
Yes, I, Vincenzio
Albeto Girolomo,

594
00:45:57,459 --> 00:46:00,872
ask you, bella Rosa, out.

595
00:46:02,005 --> 00:46:03,370
A round of drinks on me

596
00:46:03,548 --> 00:46:09,009
for my bella Rosa, my bello
child Giovanni and Red Dog.

597
00:46:14,893 --> 00:46:17,680
He saved my life once. True.

598
00:46:17,854 --> 00:46:19,390
Yeah? How did he do that?

599
00:46:20,899 --> 00:46:24,562
Everyone that ends up
in this part of the country

600
00:46:24,736 --> 00:46:26,146
has something
they're running away from.

601
00:46:26,321 --> 00:46:27,777
Hang on.

602
00:46:27,947 --> 00:46:31,815
Lack of money, broken heaet,

603
00:46:31,993 --> 00:46:37,113
violent acts, loss of hope.

604
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,997
We all have a story
we left behind.

605
00:46:41,628 --> 00:46:46,213
10 years ago, my wife and girl
were killed in an auto accident

606
00:46:46,382 --> 00:46:47,997
when I was driving.

607
00:46:48,176 --> 00:46:50,713
Oh, Jesus, I... I'm sorry.

608
00:46:53,181 --> 00:46:57,299
What Vanno said was true.
I... I hadn't laughed in years.

609
00:46:58,728 --> 00:47:02,266
Then one fine morning I woke up

610
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,056
and I didn't find it so fine.

611
00:47:08,613 --> 00:47:10,444
Oh, g'day, Jumbo.

612
00:47:12,617 --> 00:47:13,982
Couldn't stand a drink

613
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,367
for me poor nerves and
me throbbing scar, could you?

614
00:47:16,538 --> 00:47:17,903
No worries, Jumbo.

615
00:47:18,081 --> 00:47:19,696
Throbbing something
horrible all night.

616
00:47:19,874 --> 00:47:21,489
And what do I hear this morning?

617
00:47:21,668 --> 00:47:25,286
Me old nemesis. Lord Nelson.
is back off Hansen's Cove,

618
00:47:25,463 --> 00:47:28,580
swimming back and forth,
carefree as a kiss.

619
00:47:28,758 --> 00:47:30,294
Huh.

620
00:47:32,053 --> 00:47:34,044
I feel like
Captain bloody Hook.

621
00:47:34,222 --> 00:47:37,680
Tick-tock, tick-tock

622
00:47:59,497 --> 00:48:02,239
Hey, mate, can you grab
us a cold one out of the esky?

623
00:48:02,417 --> 00:48:05,033
Oh, g'day, mate.

624
00:48:09,382 --> 00:48:10,417
Get it!

625
00:48:24,689 --> 00:48:27,726
Where are you,
you lazy-arse fish?

626
00:48:34,324 --> 00:48:38,237
Hey, get out of it, you mongrel!
That's my steak!

627
00:48:46,044 --> 00:48:47,750
Drop that steak!

628
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,746
Jocko!
Get out!

629
00:49:30,129 --> 00:49:31,869
Shark!

630
00:49:33,758 --> 00:49:37,296
Faster!
Get in, Jocko!

631
00:49:38,596 --> 00:49:40,132
Ah!

632
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,888
Do you want to die?
Get rid of the steak!

633
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:07,155
Get in!

634
00:50:11,462 --> 00:50:13,202
You alright?

635
00:50:20,638 --> 00:50:23,971
Wasn't for Red Dog and
that prime hunk of red meat,

636
00:50:24,142 --> 00:50:26,554
you'd be looking
at fish bait.

637
00:50:44,078 --> 00:50:45,659
Hello?

638
00:50:56,716 --> 00:50:59,628
Oh. uh. Wait.
Wait a second. Uh...

639
00:51:08,644 --> 00:51:10,020
A gentleman.

640
00:51:10,188 --> 00:51:11,803
Four sisters.

641
00:51:11,981 --> 00:51:14,313
Ah. Well...

642
00:51:14,484 --> 00:51:15,894
Oh, yeah, sorry. Sorry.

643
00:51:16,069 --> 00:51:17,605
Yeah.

644
00:51:27,246 --> 00:51:28,907
So, whatever happened
to them?

645
00:51:29,082 --> 00:51:31,744
Who?
Nancy and John.

646
00:51:35,713 --> 00:51:38,295
Uno, dos, one, two,
tres, cuatro.

647
00:51:47,225 --> 00:51:48,590
Up, up, up, up.

648
00:51:48,768 --> 00:51:50,304
Yeah!

649
00:52:05,243 --> 00:52:07,905
Not that song!

650
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,240
Hey.

651
00:52:11,374 --> 00:52:12,739
Excuse me, guys.

652
00:52:12,917 --> 00:52:15,124
Oh, here we go,
here we go, here we go.

653
00:52:15,294 --> 00:52:18,001
Speech!
Speech! Speech! Speech!

654
00:52:18,172 --> 00:52:22,131
Speech!
No. No, no, no, no, no.

655
00:52:22,301 --> 00:52:25,293
What do you think I'm standing
up here for, the weather?

656
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:28,178
How's the weather?
Hot!

657
00:52:29,392 --> 00:52:32,680
Now, most of you blokes
have no idea

658
00:52:32,854 --> 00:52:34,594
what we're celebrating
here tonight.

659
00:52:34,772 --> 00:52:36,353
You heard there was
free beer and food

660
00:52:36,524 --> 00:52:38,765
and you came swarming out of
the night like locusts.

661
00:52:38,943 --> 00:52:42,151
He's not a bad bloke
for a seppo.

662
00:52:42,321 --> 00:52:44,061
But I'm here to tell you
there's something deeper

663
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,821
going on here tonight.

664
00:52:45,992 --> 00:52:48,324
We're celebrating
a unique moment in my life.

665
00:52:48,494 --> 00:52:50,234
Sedentariness.
Did he say he was on drugs?

666
00:52:50,413 --> 00:52:52,324
Nah, I think he's joining
the priesthood.

667
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:56,119
Now, I've been in Dampier
two years and one day.

668
00:52:56,294 --> 00:52:58,159
That is one day longer
than I've ever been

669
00:52:58,337 --> 00:53:00,248
In any single place
my whole life.

670
00:53:00,423 --> 00:53:03,165
Why, you ask? Why? Why?
Why?

671
00:53:03,342 --> 00:53:06,379
Why in this glorious
armpit of the North-West?

672
00:53:08,097 --> 00:53:09,553
One reason.

673
00:53:09,724 --> 00:53:12,761
One incredibly
beautiful reason.

674
00:53:14,562 --> 00:53:16,302
I am hopelessly in love
with Nancy Grey,

675
00:53:16,481 --> 00:53:19,063
and I am not afraid to tell
the world about it, or her.

676
00:53:25,698 --> 00:53:27,108
Uh... Huh.

677
00:53:27,283 --> 00:53:30,195
Nancy Jane Grey...

678
00:53:34,707 --> 00:53:36,243
...will you marry me?

679
00:53:37,335 --> 00:53:38,871
John Grant...

680
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:41,286
...I will!

681
00:53:55,811 --> 00:53:57,972
Now, go home!

682
00:54:09,033 --> 00:54:11,445
Lovely party.
Mmm

683
00:54:14,622 --> 00:54:16,533
I think we should
go to my place.

684
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:19,411
Or we could just go
into my bed.

685
00:54:19,585 --> 00:54:22,952
Which two of your mates
are passed out in.

686
00:54:27,552 --> 00:54:29,793
Red Dog, you stay.
You hear me?

687
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,557
I'll be back in the morning.

688
00:55:13,639 --> 00:55:16,301
Go back to sleep,
beautiful.

689
00:55:18,603 --> 00:55:20,264
I'll see you tonight, OK?

690
00:55:57,391 --> 00:55:58,767
Hello?

691
00:55:58,934 --> 00:56:00,390
Oh, hello, Nancy.
It's Jocko.

692
00:56:00,561 --> 00:56:03,268
Hello, Jocko.
How's your head?

693
00:56:03,439 --> 00:56:04,804
What head?

694
00:56:04,982 --> 00:56:06,563
Some joker's replaced it
with a swollen pumpkin.

695
00:56:08,277 --> 00:56:10,654
Have you seen John?
Why?

696
00:56:10,821 --> 00:56:12,197
Well, he never
showed up for work.

697
00:56:12,365 --> 00:56:14,947
He left my place early
to go back to his house

698
00:56:16,494 --> 00:56:18,359
He probably went
back to sleep, is all.

699
00:56:18,537 --> 00:56:20,949
I'll... It's nearly lunch.

700
00:56:21,123 --> 00:56:22,738
I'll pop over
and take a peek.

701
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:26,626
Call me when you find him.
Will do.

702
00:56:47,149 --> 00:56:48,605
See that?
What?

703
00:56:48,776 --> 00:56:50,562
Turn around.

704
00:56:56,992 --> 00:56:58,903
Slow down.

705
00:57:07,878 --> 00:57:09,459
Here!

706
00:57:13,467 --> 00:57:14,547
Oh!

707
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:18,803
No. Oh!

708
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,537
With all the sadness
and the...

709
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:48,666
...arrangements for the funeral,

710
00:57:48,836 --> 00:57:50,701
everyone forgot about Red Dog.

711
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,871
Wasn't till
three days had passed

712
00:57:53,048 --> 00:57:54,879
that anyone noticed that...

713
00:57:56,218 --> 00:57:58,254
...he was still waiting
outside John's house.

714
00:58:07,438 --> 00:58:09,895
Nancy made an effort
to claim him, but...

715
00:58:10,065 --> 00:58:12,056
...he was a one-master dog.

716
00:58:12,234 --> 00:58:13,770
So he waited.

717
00:58:13,944 --> 00:58:16,606
In the heat and the cold,
day and night.

718
00:58:16,781 --> 00:58:21,275
For three weeks, he sat
in front of John's house

719
00:58:21,452 --> 00:58:23,568
and barely moved,

720
00:58:23,746 --> 00:58:26,237
his eyes
always on the road.

721
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:34,170
Then one day,
Red Dog made a decision.

722
00:58:35,674 --> 00:58:39,963
If John wasn't gonna come home.
then he, Red Dog,

723
00:58:40,137 --> 00:58:43,220
would go out in the world
and find John.

724
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:48,680
Walked in the transport...

725
00:58:48,854 --> 00:58:52,517
and looked into the face...
of every man there.

726
00:58:54,109 --> 00:58:57,021
He was asking
a single question.

727
00:58:57,196 --> 00:58:59,437
''Have you seen John?''

728
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,366
''Have you seen John?''

729
00:59:20,678 --> 00:59:22,634
''Have you seen John?''

730
00:59:28,644 --> 00:59:30,555
''Have you seen John?''

731
00:59:33,691 --> 00:59:36,808
He looked everywhere
at Hamersley. Every department.

732
00:59:36,986 --> 00:59:38,601
And when he couldn't
find him there,

733
00:59:38,779 --> 00:59:40,861
he went to the saltworks.

734
00:59:43,617 --> 00:59:45,198
And then the mall.

735
00:59:52,251 --> 00:59:54,207
And then the pub.

736
01:00:04,805 --> 01:00:06,511
And even the harbour.

737
01:00:21,447 --> 01:00:24,860
Most dogs would have
stopped there, in Dampier.

738
01:00:25,034 --> 01:00:27,025
But most dogs
weren't Red Dog.

739
01:00:27,202 --> 01:00:29,989
And this is how
he became famous.

740
01:00:30,164 --> 01:00:35,625
This is how he became
the Pilbara Wanderer,

741
01:00:35,794 --> 01:00:37,170
Dog of the North-West.

742
01:00:37,338 --> 01:00:38,669
You see, mate.

743
01:00:38,839 --> 01:00:41,000
...he went everywhere.

744
01:02:48,886 --> 01:02:50,467
He travelled for years.

745
01:02:50,637 --> 01:02:53,925
Town to town to town.

746
01:02:54,099 --> 01:02:57,933
He was spotted down in Perth
more than once

747
01:02:58,103 --> 01:03:00,185
and as far north as Darwin.

748
01:03:17,664 --> 01:03:19,575
And I have it
on good authority

749
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:22,036
that he even hitched a ride
on an ore ship

750
01:03:22,211 --> 01:03:25,203
from Poet Hedland
to Saganoseki, Japan.

751
01:03:44,108 --> 01:03:49,102
But in the end,
after all the looking

752
01:03:49,279 --> 01:03:51,691
and the travelling...

753
01:03:53,325 --> 01:03:54,940
...the grief...

754
01:03:56,829 --> 01:03:58,615
...I think he finally knew.

755
01:03:58,789 --> 01:04:00,450
lt was time.

756
01:04:00,624 --> 01:04:03,787
Time to come home.

757
01:05:15,782 --> 01:05:17,363
Red?

758
01:05:18,452 --> 01:05:19,532
Red?

759
01:05:19,703 --> 01:05:21,159
Red Dog! Red!

760
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:23,821
Red Dog! Hello!

761
01:05:23,999 --> 01:05:25,955
Red Dog. Red Dog!

762
01:05:26,126 --> 01:05:28,412
You came back!

763
01:05:34,927 --> 01:05:36,383
Did you hear?

764
01:05:36,553 --> 01:05:40,296
I got a promotion.
I'm an executive assistant now.

765
01:05:40,474 --> 01:05:42,089
Which is really
the same as a secretary

766
01:05:42,267 --> 01:05:44,132
except I get paid
a bit more.

767
01:05:44,311 --> 01:05:47,098
They've put me on the list for one
of the new houses at Karratha.

768
01:05:47,272 --> 01:05:49,183
Oh.

769
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:52,566
And I finally let
that Kurt bloke take me out.

770
01:05:52,736 --> 01:05:54,146
I don't think so.

771
01:05:54,321 --> 01:05:56,778
Bad dental hygiene.

772
01:06:01,995 --> 01:06:03,986
Shh.

773
01:06:08,835 --> 01:06:10,746
Hello.

774
01:06:10,921 --> 01:06:12,582
Miss Grey.
Mmm.

775
01:06:12,756 --> 01:06:14,257
It's come to our attention

776
01:06:14,424 --> 01:06:16,676
that you're in serious
violation of park rules.

777
01:06:16,843 --> 01:06:19,585
And what would they be?
You know what.

778
01:06:19,763 --> 01:06:22,550
No dogs allowed!
It's a silly rule.

779
01:06:22,724 --> 01:06:25,261
We know you have a dog
in there. No point in denying.

780
01:06:25,435 --> 01:06:28,893
Red Dog is not your
average dog, Mr Cribbage.

781
01:06:29,064 --> 01:06:32,306
He has privileges.
Everybody knows that.

782
01:06:32,484 --> 01:06:34,725
I don't care if he's
the Queen's bloody corgi.

783
01:06:34,903 --> 01:06:37,815
If you don't get rid of him,
we get rid of you.

784
01:06:39,533 --> 01:06:41,319
Aha!

785
01:06:41,493 --> 01:06:43,199
Red, stop that.

786
01:06:45,414 --> 01:06:48,201
Your contract clearly states
that you cannot own a dog.

787
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:50,832
I don't own Red Dog.
Nobody does.

788
01:06:51,003 --> 01:06:53,164
Then he's a stray.
No. He's common.

789
01:06:53,338 --> 01:06:54,999
What the heck's common?

790
01:06:55,173 --> 01:06:57,710
He's accepted and cared for
by the town.

791
01:06:57,884 --> 01:06:59,920
The community.

792
01:07:00,095 --> 01:07:01,756
Now, there's a laugh.

793
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:04,922
That's no proper town.
And there's no such community.

794
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:07,011
It's just a bunch
of dirty miners

795
01:07:07,185 --> 01:07:09,597
working, drinking and whoring.

796
01:07:09,771 --> 01:07:12,057
What happens in this park
is what I say.

797
01:07:12,232 --> 01:07:14,439
And I say that dog
is a dangerous stray,

798
01:07:14,609 --> 01:07:15,985
plain and simple.

799
01:07:16,153 --> 01:07:18,690
And the next time I see him,
I'll shoot him for sure.

800
01:07:18,864 --> 01:07:20,229
Listen to me,
you little bug.

801
01:07:20,407 --> 01:07:22,819
You as much as harm a hair
on that dog's head

802
01:07:22,993 --> 01:07:25,826
and you will have me
and the entire Pilbara to answer to!

803
01:07:25,996 --> 01:07:28,954
You've been warned, Miss Grey.
And so have you.

804
01:07:42,888 --> 01:07:44,378
Now, once more.

805
01:07:44,556 --> 01:07:47,172
 We can't be beaten

806
01:07:47,351 --> 01:07:49,342
 What'll we tell 'em, boys?

807
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:51,635
 We can't be beaten

808
01:07:51,813 --> 01:07:55,305
 There comes a time
'when every man must fight

809
01:07:55,484 --> 01:07:59,227
 When he believes in
justice and right

810
01:07:59,404 --> 01:08:03,898
 He'll take so much
till he'll take no more

811
01:08:04,076 --> 01:08:07,819
 They'll hear us coming
when they hear the mighty roar

812
01:08:07,996 --> 01:08:12,330
 Shoulder to shoulder.
we're gonna stand

813
01:08:12,501 --> 01:08:16,744
 We're gonna fight
to the very last man... 

814
01:08:42,906 --> 01:08:44,112
Who was it?

815
01:08:45,367 --> 01:08:46,903
Everyone

816
01:08:53,083 --> 01:08:55,290
Stop that!

817
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:57,496
Who are all you people?

818
01:08:57,671 --> 01:09:01,129
Well, they would be
the community of Dampier.

819
01:09:01,299 --> 01:09:06,339
But since there is no proper
town and no such community,

820
01:09:06,513 --> 01:09:10,506
I guess they're just a bunch
of dirty, drunken miners.

821
01:09:10,684 --> 01:09:13,300
Yeah!
That's right. Dirty, drunken.

822
01:09:14,354 --> 01:09:16,219
I'll call the police, I will.

823
01:09:16,398 --> 01:09:18,514
There's no need, Mr Cribbage.
Back here.

824
01:09:19,693 --> 01:09:22,025
Get these people
out of my park!

825
01:09:22,195 --> 01:09:24,447
Now, Mr Cribbage,
you're just the caretaker.

826
01:09:24,614 --> 01:09:26,570
Hamersley owns the land.
So what?

827
01:09:26,741 --> 01:09:30,108
I take care of the land.
You got a problem with that?

828
01:09:35,584 --> 01:09:37,290
What do you all want with me?

829
01:09:37,461 --> 01:09:40,168
Oh, we just have
a small delegation

830
01:09:40,338 --> 01:09:42,249
that would like to have
a private word with you.

831
01:09:42,424 --> 01:09:43,789
That's all.

832
01:09:43,967 --> 01:09:47,084
Oh, whoops.
Seems to be my break time.

833
01:09:47,262 --> 01:09:49,674
Call me if you need me.

834
01:10:10,619 --> 01:10:12,359
We had a little chat.

835
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,992
It was very civilised and all.
You were very persuasive.

836
01:10:16,166 --> 01:10:17,576
It was nothing, really.

837
01:10:17,751 --> 01:10:21,369
All the Cribbages needed
was a bit of ed-u-cation.

838
01:10:22,631 --> 01:10:24,792
Well, they were so educated

839
01:10:24,966 --> 01:10:28,129
that they ran away and
took their caravan with them.

840
01:10:30,805 --> 01:10:32,545
The only thing
they left behind...

841
01:10:32,724 --> 01:10:34,180
,.was their cat.

842
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:38,521
So as Red Dog
would never be accused

843
01:10:38,688 --> 01:10:40,189
of being a low-down
dirty stray again,

844
01:10:40,357 --> 01:10:43,975
we all had him registered
at the shire as common.

845
01:10:52,953 --> 01:10:54,489
Oh!

846
01:10:57,249 --> 01:10:58,739
But...

847
01:10:58,917 --> 01:11:01,829
...there was a reckoning
still to be decided.

848
01:11:02,003 --> 01:11:05,120
The Cribbages
'were gone, true,

849
01:11:05,298 --> 01:11:09,587
but let us not forget
that a dark, sinister force

850
01:11:09,761 --> 01:11:12,002
still ruled over
the caravan park.

851
01:11:22,232 --> 01:11:24,473
Good versus evil!

852
01:11:24,651 --> 01:11:27,859
Civilization versus chaos!

853
01:11:28,029 --> 01:11:31,772
Doggie do versus cat poo!

854
01:11:59,436 --> 01:12:03,395
Red Dog and Red Cat are going
at it! Place your bets, gents!

855
01:12:04,983 --> 01:12:06,143
They fight!

856
01:12:07,402 --> 01:12:09,233
They fight!

857
01:13:02,123 --> 01:13:03,499
What?

858
01:13:07,837 --> 01:13:09,577
Spectacular.

859
01:13:28,525 --> 01:13:32,859
Nobody knows how or why.

860
01:13:33,029 --> 01:13:35,190
Perhaps it was
a grudging respect.

861
01:13:35,365 --> 01:13:37,572
Certainly, they were
the scrappiest and the rangiest

862
01:13:37,742 --> 01:13:39,448
their two kinds
have ever cooked up.

863
01:13:42,414 --> 01:13:46,783
Perhaps they saw more than a bit
of themselves in each other.

864
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,541
Who knows?

865
01:13:48,712 --> 01:13:50,998
But know this.

866
01:13:51,172 --> 01:13:53,083
Mates, they became.

867
01:13:57,095 --> 01:14:00,383
Red Cat and Red Dog
Red Cat and Red Dog.

868
01:14:19,868 --> 01:14:21,233
Shh, shh, shh.

869
01:14:21,411 --> 01:14:23,823
There's an iron statue outside

870
01:14:23,997 --> 01:14:26,534
brought up from Perth

871
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:28,573
by this fine man, Thomas, here.

872
01:14:28,752 --> 01:14:32,495
It's of that old English
explorer William Dampier

873
01:14:32,672 --> 01:14:36,415
Paid for, as in all things,
by Hamersley Iron...

874
01:14:38,219 --> 01:14:40,255
.to stand at
the entrance of this town.

875
01:14:41,931 --> 01:14:46,140
Dampier sailed into the harbour
in 16-something-or-other,

876
01:14:46,311 --> 01:14:49,098
spent five minutes,
sailed out again.

877
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,728
The only thing
he wrote about the place was,

878
01:14:53,902 --> 01:14:55,312
''Too many flies.''

879
01:14:55,487 --> 01:14:57,819
That's it!

880
01:14:57,989 --> 01:14:59,729
''Too many flies''!

881
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:03,066
Well, I say,
to hell with that!

882
01:15:03,244 --> 01:15:05,906
Why should we have a statue

883
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:10,073
honouring a poncy Pommy
fly-hating aristocrat?

884
01:15:10,251 --> 01:15:13,243
Or, for that matter,
a fat bloody general,

885
01:15:13,421 --> 01:15:16,128
or, God help us,
a stinkin' politician?

886
01:15:16,299 --> 01:15:19,006
Yeah!

887
01:15:20,553 --> 01:15:23,716
We should have somebody
that understands this place.

888
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:31,012
Somebody that lives and breathes
this vastness and desolation.

889
01:15:31,189 --> 01:15:35,353
Somebody that's got red dust
stuck up their nose

890
01:15:35,527 --> 01:15:37,483
and in their eyes
and their hair

891
01:15:37,654 --> 01:15:39,190
and up their arse!

892
01:15:41,741 --> 01:15:43,402
Somebody that's like
all of us.

893
01:15:44,577 --> 01:15:46,317
Men...

894
01:15:46,496 --> 01:15:47,986
...and women...

895
01:15:48,164 --> 01:15:51,201
who understand the
meaning of Independence

896
01:15:51,376 --> 01:15:55,164
and the importance
of a generous heart.

897
01:15:56,756 --> 01:16:01,546
Mates who are loyal
by nature, not design...

898
01:16:04,305 --> 01:16:08,890
...and who know the meaning
of love and loss.

899
01:16:09,978 --> 01:16:12,685
Somebody
that represents our home.

900
01:16:14,649 --> 01:16:18,141
Somebody that represents
the Pilbara in all of us.

901
01:16:20,446 --> 01:16:22,823
And I say that somebody...

902
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:24,356
...dammit...

903
01:16:24,534 --> 01:16:26,024
...is a dog!

904
01:16:44,262 --> 01:16:45,968
Guess whose shout.

905
01:16:56,357 --> 01:16:57,972
 Way out west

906
01:16:58,151 --> 01:17:00,437
 Where the rain don't fall

907
01:17:00,612 --> 01:17:04,981
 Got a job with the company
digging for ore

908
01:17:05,158 --> 01:17:07,900
 Just to make some bread

909
01:17:08,077 --> 01:17:12,366
 Living and a-working
on the land

910
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:18,326
 Quit my job
and I left my wife

911
01:17:18,504 --> 01:17:22,292
 I headed out west
for a brand-new life

912
01:17:22,467 --> 01:17:24,378
 Just to get away

913
01:17:24,552 --> 01:17:28,591
 Living and a working
on the land... 

914
01:17:28,765 --> 01:17:30,130
Yeah!

915
01:17:32,185 --> 01:17:35,473
 What a change it's been

916
01:17:35,647 --> 01:17:39,731
 From working
that nine-to-five

917
01:17:41,069 --> 01:17:44,106
 How strange it's been

918
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:49,240
 At last I get the feeling
that I'm really alive

919
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:52,994
 Way out west,
where the rain don't fall

920
01:17:53,164 --> 01:17:57,407
 Got a job with a company
drilling for oil

921
01:17:57,585 --> 01:17:59,871
 And I'm never gonna leave

922
01:18:00,046 --> 01:18:04,005
 Living and a working
on the land

923
01:18:04,175 --> 01:18:06,837
 La-la la-la-la la-la

924
01:18:07,011 --> 01:18:11,220
 La-la-la la-la la-la

925
01:18:11,391 --> 01:18:16,977
 La-la-la la-la la-la la

926
01:18:17,146 --> 01:18:22,482
 Living and a-working
on the land

927
01:18:24,696 --> 01:18:28,029
 La-la-la la-la la-la

928
01:18:28,199 --> 01:18:32,738
 La-la-la la-la la-la la... 

929
01:18:32,912 --> 01:18:34,573
Whoo!
Yeah!

930
01:18:34,747 --> 01:18:37,705
 Living and a working
on the land. 

931
01:18:37,875 --> 01:18:39,740
Hey

932
01:18:39,919 --> 01:18:41,830
To Red Dog!

933
01:18:42,005 --> 01:18:47,671
The best damn doggie
in the whole damn country!

934
01:18:55,476 --> 01:18:59,936
Hey. Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

935
01:19:00,982 --> 01:19:02,438
He's gone.

936
01:19:04,277 --> 01:19:05,813
No, no.

937
01:19:05,987 --> 01:19:09,104
He's gone from the room.
He's not out the back anymore.

938
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:15,197
We have to find him.
Come on. Let's go.

939
01:19:15,371 --> 01:19:16,872
Red Dog!
Red!

940
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,622
Red! Red!

941
01:20:38,079 --> 01:20:39,615
Doggie!

942
01:20:40,915 --> 01:20:43,497
Red Doggie! Red!

943
01:20:45,002 --> 01:20:46,378
Doggie!

944
01:20:46,546 --> 01:20:48,082
Red!

945
01:20:49,674 --> 01:20:51,210
Here, Red!

946
01:20:53,302 --> 01:20:54,678
Here, boy!

947
01:20:56,389 --> 01:20:58,220
Red!

948
01:21:00,268 --> 01:21:01,758
Red!

949
01:21:01,936 --> 01:21:03,301
Red!

950
01:21:03,479 --> 01:21:05,015
Where are you, boy?

951
01:21:05,189 --> 01:21:06,770
Red!

952
01:21:28,838 --> 01:21:31,170
Red Dog, come home.

953
01:21:40,975 --> 01:21:42,340
They've found him.

954
01:23:14,902 --> 01:23:17,314
You stay, boy.

955
01:23:17,488 --> 01:23:19,945
You stay here

956
01:23:22,285 --> 01:23:24,025
You're home now.

957
01:24:31,729 --> 01:24:34,186
 When people
keep repeating

958
01:24:34,357 --> 01:24:36,848
 That you'll never
fall in love

959
01:24:37,026 --> 01:24:39,984
 When everybody
keeps retreating

960
01:24:40,154 --> 01:24:42,236
 But you can't seem
to get enough

961
01:24:42,406 --> 01:24:45,364
 Let my love
open the door... 

962
01:24:45,534 --> 01:24:48,071
Oh, my God!

963
01:24:48,245 --> 01:24:50,236
 Let my love
open the door... 

964
01:24:50,414 --> 01:24:52,700
Where'd you get him?
Vanno was giving them away.

965
01:24:52,875 --> 01:24:56,709
 Let my love open the door
 Let my love open the door

966
01:24:56,879 --> 01:25:00,463
 Let my love open the door
 Ooh-ooh

967
01:25:00,633 --> 01:25:03,124
 Let my love open the door

968
01:25:03,302 --> 01:25:06,009
 When everything
feels all over

969
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:08,796
 Everybody seems unkind... 

970
01:25:08,974 --> 01:25:12,307
Ladies and gentlemen, if you
would please take a seat.

971
01:25:12,478 --> 01:25:14,469
 Take all worry
out of your mind

972
01:25:14,647 --> 01:25:17,309
 Let my love open the door

973
01:25:17,483 --> 01:25:19,815
 Let my love
open the door... 

974
01:25:21,529 --> 01:25:23,520
 Let my love open the door

975
01:25:23,697 --> 01:25:26,439
 To your heart
