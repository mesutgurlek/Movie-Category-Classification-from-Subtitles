00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,508
Today, it's like -
it's really working.

159
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,709
You're single, right?

160
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,077
Susan= Yes, I'm single.

161
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,879
Jay= Yeah, I'm single, too.
This is great.

162
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:30,615
Susan= You're single
because you're an asshole.

163
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,753
Jay= Yeah, but an interesting
and fun asshole.

164
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,054
{ Chuckles }

165
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,856
Listen,
I'm gonna cut right to it.

166
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,791
My brother's getting married
in new Orleans this weekend,

167
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,027
and I was kind of thinking
if you weren't busy or anything,

168
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,162
- you and me...
- Susan= You're serious.

169
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,897
Jay=
What, is that a yes?

170
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,973
Man=
This is Daisy Kensington.

171
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,046
Margie=
Thank you, Mr. Wheeler.

172
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:03,882
Jay= Uh-huh.

173
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:06,518
Okay, fellas. Break time.

174
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,186
Mr. phelpmitter= I'm only here
because I refuse to vote.

175
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,654
Jay= I know.

176
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,056
Mr. phelpmitter=
Because I refuse

177
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:12,924
to use credit cards
or go on the Internet.

178
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,259
They know my record.

179
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:15,861
They know your record, too,
Mr. Wheeler,

180
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,062
if that's your real name.

181
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,997
They know everything about you.

182
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,534
I am off the grid, baby!

183
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,035
Just because I won't go
to websites,

184
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,770
just because I don't have
a cell phone,

185
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,272
I won't even look
at a television -

186
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,707
- that's why, that's why.
- Jay= You don't have to.

187
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,876
Come on. Sit down.

188
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:32,143
Sit down.

189
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,880
Mr. b.
how's the wildman today?

190
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,150
Yeah. She's nice.

191
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,656
Pretty women, Mr. b.
You remember pretty women?

192
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,928
Yeah.

193
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:54,699
Frakel= Bertleman wants
to see you in his office.

194
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,636
Jay= Now, listen. I don't know
what frakel told you.

195
00:08:57,638 --> 00:09:00,105
Dr. bertleman= You're giving
alcohol and pornography

196
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,640
to my patients.

197
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,241
Jay= They're my friends.

198
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:07,913
Dr. bertleman= They are,
variously, psychotic, catatonic,

199
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:10,115
manic, and delusional.

200
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:12,684
They are also my responsibility.

201
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,019
From this point forward,

202
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,954
you will have no contact
with these patients

203
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,023
except to mop the floor
beneath their feet.

204
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,324
Are we clear?

205
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,560
Jay= Yeah, we're clear.

206
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,161
Absolutely, yeah.

207
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:26,631
Dr. bertleman= I'm fully aware
that if you lose this job,

208
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,133
you violate your probation.

209
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,035
If you let that happen,

210
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:33,338
you will find yourself downwind
from a category-5 shit storm.

211
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,906
- Jay= Can I -
- Dr. bertleman= I'm done.

212
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,608
Jay= Okay.

213
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,020
Dr. bertleman= It's
miss Daisy Kensington, right?

214
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:56,094
Miss Kensington,
do you know where you are?

215
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,866
It's okay.

216
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,235
This is a psychiatric hospital.

217
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:11,309
The police report says
that your mother passed away

218
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:15,080
and you left a note
for the mailman

219
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:18,083
asking him what you should do.

220
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:28,994
Miss Kensington,
are you aware of the time?

221
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:32,330
Do you know the day,
month, year?

222
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,737
Daisy= Um...

223
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:42,841
I'm not exactly sure
what day it is.

224
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:45,243
Dr. bertleman= It's okay.

225
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,079
Do you know why you're here?

226
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:56,021
Daisy= I guess, uh...

227
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,065
...the voices.

228
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,038
{ Door opens }

229
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,406
Frakel=
We're gonna do some tests.

230
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:16,107
Daisy= But I'm supposed to be
sleeping.

231
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,409
Frakel=
I know. It won't take long.

232
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:18,910
Daisy= Are you a doctor?

233
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,111
Frakel=
Yeah, I'm your special doctor.

234
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,781
Daisy= Oh. Oh!

235
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:26,751
Oh, wait. Oh, stop. Please.

236
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,219
{ Gasps }

237
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,121
Oh, my.

238
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,856
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

239
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,091
Jay= It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

240
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,793
Daisy= I didn't mean
to cause any trouble.

241
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,294
Jay= You didn't do anything
wrong. The guy's a freak.

242
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,697
- He was gonna hurt you.
- Daisy= But he's a doctor.

243
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,398
Jay= No, no.
He's not a doctor.

244
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,767
Now, listen to me. You got to
protect yourself in here, okay?

245
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,469
Daisy=
You're the mopping man.

246
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,271
Jay= Yeah, I'm Jay.

247
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:48,139
Daisy= Where's your mop?

248
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,974
Jay= Doesn't matter. I got to get
out of here. You gonna be okay?

249
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,877
Jay= Mrs. nealberry,
go back to bed, please.

250
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,212
Mrs. nealberry=
It's time to get up.

251
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,480
Jay=
No, baby. It's time to sleep.

252
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,881
Mrs. nealberry=
It's time to sleep.

253
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,283
Jay= Hey. Be careful.

254
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,351
Woman=
It's time to get up.

255
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:03,988
Wash your face, wash your hands.

256

{ Beeps }

257
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,492

00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,945
What are you doing?

260
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,347
Daisy=
I'm coming with you.

261
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,249
Jay= What? No! You can't leave.
You're a patient.

262
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,284
Daisy=
I don't like it here.

263
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,186
Jay= Yeah, I get that.
But you can't just stand here.

264
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,955
Daisy=
Where should I stand?

265
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,990

come on, come on.

Daisy= I don't have any.

269
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,500
Jay=
How can you not have shoes?

270
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:50,201
Daisy= They hurt my feet.

271
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:53,004
Jay= Look.
You got to go back inside.

272
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:54,405
You got to tell them
what happened, okay?

273
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,807
Please?

Just breathe, okay?

283

Look. I really don't care
if you don't want to go back.

- Jay= I don't know.

316
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,982
Pretending to be a nurse
makes me uncomfortable.

317
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:46,184
Jay= You hump a pole naked
for money,

318
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:47,952
but this makes you
uncomfortable?

319
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,187
Woman= Uh-huh.

320
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,655
Jay=
You don't see the irony there?

321
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,590
- Woman= Unh-unh.
- Jay= Okay.

322
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,392
Woman= { Sighs }

323
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,228
Does anybody want to go
to Jay's brother's wedding?

324
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,529
All= No.

325
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,064
Jay= Come on, you guys.
I need a date.

326
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,200
Woman #2=
And why should we help you?

327
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,269
Jay= Uh, because I'm putting you
through college

328
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,304
with all those dollars
I drop in your panties?

329
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,939
Woman=
Well, what's in it for us?

330
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:10,008
Jay= The fuzzy feeling you get
helping a friend?

331
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,543
{ Laughter }

332
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:23,021
Daisy=
Why are you wearing those shoes?

333
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:26,024
¶¶ Get inside
and I'll take you to the stars ¶¶

334
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,960
She dances beautifully!

335
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:31,562
¶¶ I got them pushing
their fancy cars ¶¶

336
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,632
¶¶ young, hot, real cute,
even in a space suit ¶¶

337
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:38,002
Woman= Um, you might want
to come check on your friend.

338
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,370
Jay= Oh.

339
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:42,440
¶¶ I need someone who can aim,
fire ¶¶

340
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,310
¶¶ red velvet dynamite ¶¶

341
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:48,313
¶¶ I'm a loaded gun tonight ¶¶

342
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:51,249
¶¶ I'm a sex pistol,
pistol, pistol ¶¶

343
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,418
Bouncer= Yo, sweets,
you got to get out.

344
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,087
Daisy= But Jay said that this
was a dancing club.

345
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,355
Bouncer= Jay who?

346
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,324
Daisy= Jay.
He snuck us in the back.

347
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,960
He said that he didn't want
the bouncer to see us.

348
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,195
Bouncer=
Yo, you got to get down.

349
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,596
Come on.

350
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,665
Daisy= What? No, no.
No, no, no, no.

351
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,635
No, no, no, no, no! No! No, no,
no, no, no, no! Stop!

352
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,371
Jay= Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey!

353
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,340
Bouncer=
Yo, you need to leave now!

354
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,008
Jay= Okay, take it easy.
We're going.

355
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,410
You all right?

356
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:22,513
Okay. We're going.
We're going.

357
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,015
Come on.

358
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,284
You all right?
Okay.

359
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:30,755
Daisy= This fat man
offered me $100 for a hand job.

360
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,757
I've never had a job.

361
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,227
Jay= You sure you have
no one you can call?

362
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,298
You have no friends?
You have no family?

363
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,666
You have nobody?

364
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:48,539
What am I supposed to do
with you?

365
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,560
Do you have I.D.?

366
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,496
You got to show I.D.
At security.

367
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,735
Daisy=
I have it. It's in here.

368
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,504
Jay= What's happening?
Wh-what's wrong?

369
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:22,540
Daisy= Um, I, uh... Um...

370
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,475
I- I don't -
I- I don't know what to do.

371
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,310
Jay= That's okay. I have a plan,
and it's a good one.

372
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,079
All you have to do is smile
and eat yummy snacks.

373
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:30,548
And when people say,
"hey, what do you do?"

374
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,417
You say, "I'm a nurse. "

375
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,118
Daisy=
I'm not supposed to lie.

376
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,254
Jay= It's not a lie.

377
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,488
Not a lie.

378
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,424
It's pretending, which is fine.

379
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,725
Daisy=
What's the difference?

380
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,761
Jay=
I'll explain it to you later.

381
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:46,330
- Daisy= Okay.
- Jay= Okay?

382
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,272
Daisy= Your dancer friends
really don't mind

383
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,640
I borrowed their clothes?

384
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,708
Jay= No, no.
They wanted to help.

385
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,846
Daisy= Are you sure
this looks okay?

386
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:03,748
Jay= Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You look fantastic.

387
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,349
Really, you look great.

388
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:06,851
Just, uh, uh,
keep the sweater on.

389
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,386
- Daisy= This?
- Jay= Yeah.

390
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,587
Daisy= Whoa!

391
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,122
Jay= Oh. You okay?

392
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,724
- Daisy= Yeah.
- Jay= Okay.

393
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,397
{ Snoring }

394
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,265
Flight attendant=
I'm sorry. Hi.

395
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,800
Jay= Hi.

396
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,535
Flight attendant= Your friend's
been in the bathroom

397
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:25,736
for a really long time.

398
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,772
Jay= Okay, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

399
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,507
{ Knock on door }

400
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:32,143
Daisy, it's me.
It's Jay.

401
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,412
Daisy= There's no flusher.

402
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:37,348
Jay=
She's a first-time flyer.

403
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,683
Yeah, there is, honey.

404
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,318
It's just a little different
than usual.

405
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,752
You see the button in the wall
above the seat?

406
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,888
Flight attendant=
It's actually a lever.

407
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,456
Jay= Yeah, push that.

408
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,525
Flight attendant=
It says "flush" right on it.

409
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,494
Daisy= But the letters
are worn off.

410
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:51,829
Jay= Anyway, just push it.

411
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,397
{ Toilet flushes loudly }

412
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,466
Daisy= Aaah!

413
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,836
{ Passengers murmur }

414
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,705
It was really loud.

415
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:03,841
Jay= You handled it well,
though.

416
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,878
Okay, let's try
and get some sleep, okay?

417
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,579
Daisy= I'm not sleepy.

418
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,715
Jay=
Then eat your peanuts.

419
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,350
Daisy= I already did.

420
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,585
Jay= { Sighs }
Then eat mine.

421
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:18,923
Daisy= I already did.

422
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:20,925
Jay= Hey,
this flight's called a red eye.

423
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,527
Do you know why?

424
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,262
Because if we don't get sleep,

425
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:27,231
we're gonna have red eyes
when we get to new Orleans.

426
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:30,468
And you don't want red eyes
when you meet my family, do you?

427
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,869
Daisy= No.

428
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,304
Jay= No.

429
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,373
So, let's be quiet.

430
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,543
Okay.

431
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:41,279
{ Sighs }

432
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,350
Man= { Clears throat }

433
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,825
Flight attendant= I'm sorry.

434
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,494
- Jay= Hi.
- Flight attendant= Hi.

435
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:58,396
We have another problem.

436
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,469
Jay= Let's go, hon.
You can't sit here.

437
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,405
Daisy= But the seats
are too small back there.

438
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,440
Jay= I know, but we didn't pay
for the big seats.

439
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,675
Daisy=
Can we pay for them now?

440
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:11,876
Jay=
No, we can't pay for them now.

441
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,644
Woman=
What's wrong with her?

442
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,246
Jay= Excuse me. There's nothing
wrong with my girlfriend.

443
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:16,647
Thank you.

444
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,583
Let's go, hon. I'm lonely
back there. Come on.

445
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:19,784
Daisy=
Do we have to sleep?

446
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,652
Jay=
No, we don't have to sleep.

447
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,654
Daisy= Can we get some of those
good nuts in the nice dish?

448
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,323
Man= Um, take mine.

449
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:28,459
Daisy= I already did.

450
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,464
{ Indistinct conversations }

451
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,506
Everyone's moving around.

452
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,675
Jay= { Clears throat }

453
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,278
Yeah, we're getting ready
to land.

454
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:53,017
Daisy= Before...

455
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:57,822
You called me your girlfriend.

456
00:20:57,824 --> 00:21:00,424
Am I really your girlfriend?

457
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,695
Jay= Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're my girlfriend.

458
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:08,833
{ Sighs deeply }

459
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:15,573
Daisy= My mother told me I would
never be anybody's girlfriend.

460
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:22,780
Jay= Well,
I guess she was wrong, then.

461
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,716
{ Sighs }

462
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,951
Whew.

463
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:06,624
Daisy= I think I'm just gonna
stay out here.

464
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:08,626
Jay= You'll be okay.

465
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:11,429
You'll be okay.
Come on.

466
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,968
Woman= So, let's move consuela
to the family table

467
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,671
because the wedding party
will be somewhere else.

468
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,907
Jay= Hey, mom.

469
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:26,377
Woman= Oh!
You're really here.

470
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,045
Ohh! Mwah!

471
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:29,914
Jay= Okay.

472
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,883
Okay. Okay.

473
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,618
Mom, this is Daisy.

474
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,387
- Woman= Oh, yes. Hello.
- Daisy= Hi.

475
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:37,655
Woman= Welcome.

476
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,724
Oh, my.
What a cute skirt.

477
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:41,992
Oh, you have no shoes on.

478
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,461
Jay= Oh, God, mom.

479
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:44,929
We are - we are really beat.

480
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:46,630
Woman=
Of course. Look at me.

481
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:48,566
I'll have Mary
bring up your things.

482
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:50,067
Daisy=
We don't really have any things.

483
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,736
Woman= Your luggage?

484
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:54,004
Jay= Yeah, we traveled -
we traveled light.

485
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:56,574
Woman= Well, I can always
pick you up a suit.

486
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:59,043
And remember, this is the South,
so you'll have two rooms.

487
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:02,380
Daisy= I wouldn't stay
in the same room with a man.

488
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:05,149
Jay= Yeah, we haven't, uh -
we aren't...

489
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:06,817
{ Laughs }

490
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,753
Woman= { Chuckles } Oh.

491
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:10,421
Oh.

492
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:15,659
Well, you'll be sleeping
in Marie antoinette's bed.

493
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:18,429
Daisy= Oh, no, no.
That's okay. She can have it.

494
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:19,897
I'll just sleep on the floor.

495
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,600
Woman= { Chuckling }
Oh, you are so funny.

496
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:24,435
No, darling.

497
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:26,737
Jay will have his room and you
can stay in the guest room.

498
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:40,918
{ Clock ticking }

499
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:04,675
{ Birds chirping }

500
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:18,956
Jason= I thought you quit.

501
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,093
Jay= I did.

502
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:31,836
Jason= We haven't heard from you
in a long time.

503
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:34,839
Jay= Yeah.

504
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:42,546
Jason= So, when am I gonna meet
this new girlfriend of yours?

505
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:45,182
Jay= At dinner.

506
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:47,184
Jason= Your mother says
she's very beautiful.

507
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:48,986
Jay= She is.

508
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,988
Yeah, she's very beautiful.

509
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,657
She's got me
rethinking my future.

510
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:01,732
Jason= Come on.
I want to show you something.

511
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,608
Jay= Wow!

512
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,244
Jason= It's the American dream
on four wheels.

513
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:15,179
It's even got a China cabinet.

514
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,181
Jay=
China cabinet? Really?

515
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:19,917
Jason= There's only two others
in decent condition

516
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,685
in the whole country.

517
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,754
And I practically stole it.

518
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,225
Jay= Well, hey,
it's good to be king.

519
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:31,896
Jason=
You're damn right it is.

520
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:34,031
Time for a drink.

521

{ Indistinct conversations }

522
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:39,970
Jerry= Hey!

523
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:41,272
Mom said you were coming,
but I didn't believe it.

524
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:42,773
Jay= Yeah, no, I'm here.
How you doing?

525
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:43,974
Jerry= Good, good.
I'll grab Kate.

526
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,543
Jay= Okay.

527
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:46,877
Jason= I don't suppose
you're on the wagon.

528
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,579
Jay= No, not unless
there's booze on it.

529
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:49,780
{ Both laugh }

530
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,949
Uh, well, to Jerry.

531
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:53,717
Jason= To Jerry.

532
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:57,221
So, where is this girl?

533
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,223
Jay= Oh, she's coming down
in a bit.

534
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,891
She's just - she's a bit shy.

535
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,259
Oh.

536
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,096
Here she is.

537
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:08,332
- { Clears throat }
- Daisy= I'm a nurse.

538
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:10,000
Jason= Oh, well, that's great

539
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,236
because I'm actually coming down
with something, I think.

540
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,704
Jay= Dad, this is Daisy.

541
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:15,606
Jason= Oh, call me Jason.

542
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:17,708
Oh, this is my son Jerry,
the groom.

543
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,677
- Daisy= Hello.
- Jason= And this is -

544
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,612
Kate= Kate. I'm heard so much
about you, Jay.

545
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:23,213
- Jay= Well, it's all true.
- Daisy= I'm Daisy.

546
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:24,815
I'm a nurse.

547
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:26,584
Kate= Well, thank y'all so much
for coming.

548
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:27,785
It was such a surprise.

549
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:29,086
Jerry said you met
at a hospital.

550
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,821
Jay= Yeah, we did.
It's a great story.

551
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,590
Daisy= Yeah, we met at
a hospital where I'm a nurse.

552
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:34,224
Jay= Yeah,
I think they got that part, hon.

553
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,226
Daisy= Did you tell them about
the part where you saved me

554
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,895
from a doctor
who wasn't really a doctor?

555
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:39,763
Kate= Oh, God.
Never date a doctor.

556
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,832
- They're so emotionally remote.
- Jerry= You dated a doctor?

557
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,601
Kate= No,
I read an article about it.

558
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:47,104
Daisy= God, you're so skinny!
I can see your bones.

559
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,073
Kate= Thank you.

Good.

563
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,727
Daisy= Oh, my God.

564
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:12,696
That's like drinking perfume.

565
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:14,331
Jason= Well, that's pretty much
what it costs.

566
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,800
Woman=
Have all you want, darling.

...to, um -
to Jerry and Kate.

571
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:28,812
Kate, we are so proud
and grateful

572
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,115
to welcome you
as a member of the family.

00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:32,950
And I just want to wish you both

all of the happiness
that money cannot buy.

I can't eat this.

Jay= Why not?

584
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:04,381
Daisy= Uh...

585
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,817
I think it's fancy feast.

586
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,353
- That's cat food.
- Jay= No, I got that.

587
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,755
I got that.
I know what you meant.

588

Daisy=
Are you gonna eat it?

589
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:16,226
Woman= Actually,
it's Jerry's favorite.

590
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:17,895
Jerry= Not really.

591
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:21,231
Kate= They force-feed the goose
so its liver distends.

592
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:24,134
I saw a documentary about it.
I literally cried.

593
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,369
Daisy= Aww.

594
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,471

this new job of yours.

598
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:37,147
Jay=
Uh, it's nothing glamorous.

599
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,849
Just hospital administration.

600
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:41,285
Jason= Well, at least you're not
mopping floors.

601
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:43,353
Daisy= { Chuckles }

602
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:45,489
Jay= Actually, dad, I'm looking
into some new business ventures.

603
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:47,157
Woman= Oh, really, Jay?
That's wonderful.

604
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,393
Jason= Really?
What kind of ventures?

605
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:52,196
Jay= Sports and entertainment,
mostly, new gaming applications.

606
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:53,964
Jason= What does that mean?

607
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,867
Jay= Well, uh, I'm interested
in a little start-up

608
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:59,436
that has an app
for placing bets in real time.

609
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:01,171
Jason= Gambling.

610
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,907
Well, so much for your m. B.A.

611
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,777
Jay= Well, capitalism is based
on gambling. Isn't it, dad?

612
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,278
Jerry=
Oh, it sounds interesting.

613
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,048
Daisy= He's also involved
in a dance club.

614
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,950
Jerry=
You invested in a club?

615
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:14,318
Jay= Yeah, I don't want to bore
everyone with that.

616
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,886
But at some point, dad,

617
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,755
I would like to sit down
and talk more about this.

618
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,189
Jason=
So, you came back for money.

619
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:21,024
Jay= No, I didn't come back
for money.

620
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:23,227
I came back to see
my little brother get married.

621
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:25,262
But you're the one
that taught me

622
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,030
to always be looking
for new opportunities.

623
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:28,932
Jason= Well, you had every
opportunity in the world

624
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,234
when you were here,
except for you decided to -

625
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:32,770
woman= Jason.

626
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:34,204
Jason= { Chuckles }

627
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:37,207
I also taught you
to have a plan.

628
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:40,377
Daisy= He actually does have
a plan, Jason,

629
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,980
and it's a very good one.

630
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:45,783
We just can't talk about it
right now.

631
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:47,184
Jason=
You're a part of this?

632
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:49,353
Daisy= Yes.

633
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:54,158
Jason= Well, then,
let's talk about it later.

634
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,127
Daisy= Yes, let's.

635

Daisy= { Laughs }

637
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:03,433
I've never had champagne before.

638
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:06,236
Jay=
Yeah, I kind of figured that.

639
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,839
{ Laughs }

640
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:10,407
You did great, by the way.

641
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,176
Everyone really liked you.

642
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:14,578
- Daisy= Yeah?
- Jay= Yeah, they did.

643
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,320
I'll see you in the morning.

644
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,856

00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:37,067
Uh-huh?

647
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:38,302
Woman= Honey?

648
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:39,536
Jay= Hmm?

Woman=
She's cleaning the bathroom.

650
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,607
- Jay= Who?
- Woman= Daisy.

651
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:45,475
Jay= So?

652
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:47,611
Woman=
She's cleaning our bathroom.

653
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:50,113
Jay= Oh.

654
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:54,084
Woman= Hmm. Okay.

655
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,256
Jay= Hey, there.

656
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:01,491

658
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:04,895
Where'd you get those?

659
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:09,433
Daisy= Oh, um, in this box
in the closet marked "Jay. "

660
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:11,501
Jay= Ah.

661
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:15,072
Hey, why are you cleaning
the bathroom?

662
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:19,243
Daisy= I clean.
That's what I do.

663
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:22,579
I did all the - the cooking
and the cleaning for my mother.

664
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:24,114
Jay= Okay.

665
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:27,184
Hey, give me that.

666
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:29,453
Listen.

667
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:32,890
You don't have to do
any of that here.

668
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:35,592
Okay?

669
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:38,996
Daisy= My mother said
that this is how you earn love.

670
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,600
Jay= Huh?

671
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:45,035
Uh, wait.

672
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:46,904
I thought you didn't have
any family.

673
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:49,473
Daisy= I don't.

674
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:51,675
She's dead.

675
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,547
Jay= Well, I'm sorry,
but your mother didn't know

676
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,349
what the hell
she was talking about.

677
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:03,186
You just love people
'cause you love them

678
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:05,422
and that's it.

679
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:12,996
What?

680
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:24,174
Daisy=
My mother is dead...

681
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:26,176
Because I killed her.

682
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,980
Jay= Hmm?

683
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,051
Daisy= I killed her.

684
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:38,088
That's why they put me
in the hospital.

685
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,965
Jay= Okay.

686
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,387
Woman= Oh, my.

687
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:11,621
Daisy= { Chuckles }

688
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:13,390
It doesn't really cover up

689
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:15,625
everything
that it's supposed to.

690
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:17,194
Woman= Well,
it's barely a dress at all.

691
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:18,996
Daisy= Jay borrowed it
from a stripper.

692
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:21,231
Woman= { Chuckles } You're
probably not joking, are you?

693
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:24,401
Come.

694
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,117
Now, I've kept every dress
I've ever worn

695
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:44,221
knowing they would
come in handy some day.

{ Chuckles }

697
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:49,459

{ Chuckles }

699
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:53,063
Can we play a little bit?

700
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:59,403
I think this one would be
very pretty with your skin.

701
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,175
Sorry to keep you waiting, boys.

702
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:07,744
We needed
a little extra girl time.

703
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,746
{ Chuckles }

704

Daisy= Here.

710
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:06,636
You're dropping them.

711

Girl=
Um, that's the point.

712
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,475
Jay=
No, no, no, no, no.

713

No, no, no, no, no.
Come on, come on, come on.

Sit, sit, sit, sit.

715
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,879
Continue.
Continue on.

716
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:17,347
Okay.

717
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:18,815
We're gonna sit,
we're gonna watch,

718
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,750
and we're gonna clap
when it's over.

719
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:22,352
- Okay?
- Daisy= Okay.

720
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:24,221
Jay= Okay.

Jason= I, um...

722
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,144
I've been thinking about
what you said last night.

723
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:48,578
Jay= What did I say?

724
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,313
Jason= You know,
I don't take any pleasure

725
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:51,615
in watching you struggle.

726
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:53,817
Jay=
I am not struggling, dad.

727
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,719
Jason=
Throwing money at a start-up

728
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:57,721
is like throwing darts
at a mosquito.

729
00:35:57,723 --> 00:35:58,922
Jay= So, what, you think
the guys at Mac and Amazon

730
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:00,524
feel that way?

731
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:01,791
Jason= For every one of those
breakthroughs,

732
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,593
there's a thousand failures.

733
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:06,196
Everybody thinks he's gonna be
the exception of the rule.

734
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:08,398
Jay= Yeah, but, dad,
I've done my research.

735
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,667
This company I'm talking about
has got sound fundamentals,

736
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:14,171
it's well capitalized,
and it's got an excellent board.

737
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,173
Jason=
How much are you looking for?

738
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:20,177
Jay= 35 grand to 40 grand
will get us in the door.

739

have you been with Jay?

743
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,454
Woman= And he's brought you home
to meet the family?

744
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:07,958
Daisy= We have a plan.

746
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:14,264

Um, just a little advice.

for every pretty girl he sees.

And what do you do, dear?

753
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:32,816
- Daisy= I'm a nurse.
- Woman= A nurse!

754
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,752
Oh, Lou, show her
that thing on your back.

755

Such lovely families.

combined net worth,

I'll tell you.

still pissed off

about that Hoffman scandal.

760
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,930
Woman= I think it is a shame
about his older boy.

761
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,299
Man= Still, the pair of balls
that kid had.

762
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:51,935
Lou= While Wheeler's closing
the deal with Hoffman,

763
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:54,304
the kid is upstairs
screwing the wife.

764
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:56,506
I mean,
you can't make that stuff up.

00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,655
Daisy=
I don't think I'm kidding.

793
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:21,991
That's why no one
can understand me.

794
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:24,794
Jay= What about me?

795
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:27,731
Daisy= I don't think
they understand you, either.

796
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:30,800
Jay= { Chuckles }

797
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:33,870
¶¶ Chances are you think ¶¶

798
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:40,744
¶¶ my heart's your Valentine ¶¶

799
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:46,082
¶¶ in the magic of moonlight ¶¶

800
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:48,852
¶¶ when I saw... ¶¶

801
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:50,820
Woman= May I borrow him?

802
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:53,089
A mother doesn't get
many chances.

803
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:55,625
{ Chuckles }

804
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,529
Jason= May I?

805
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,070
Well, I got to hand it to Jay.

806
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:10,707
You're just...
Not what I expected.

807
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:12,842
Daisy= { Chuckles }

808
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:15,545
Jason=
Where did you guys meet?

809
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:17,080
Daisy= The hospital.

810
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:20,150
Jason= Daisy, Jay wouldn't be
working at a hospital

811
00:40:20,152 --> 00:40:21,785
unless there was a catch.

812
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:23,920
Daisy= Catch?

813
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,422
Jason= Yes, a catch.

814
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:26,890
And you know the catch.

815
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:28,558
Daisy= I do?

816
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,026
Jason= Yeah.

817
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:33,096
You know, I can't help him
unless I know the truth.

818
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:34,998
What's he really doing in L.A.?

819
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,202
Daisy= I'm not lying.

820
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:41,738
Jason=
I just want the truth, Daisy.

821
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,674
Daisy= { Panting }

822
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:48,111
I can't talk anymore.

823
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,013
Jason= Daisy, who are you?

824
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:52,749
Daisy= { Gasping }

825
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,087
Jerry= What's happening?

826
00:40:58,089 --> 00:40:59,489
Jason=
Something's wrong with her.

827
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:00,957
Jay= It's okay. She's fine.
She's fine.

828
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,525
Jason= She's not fine.

829
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:03,726
Jay= She's fine.
She's had too much champagne.

830
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:04,928
She needs some air.
Come on.

831
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,629
Jerry=
Let's get her outside.

832
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:07,964
Jay= That's okay. I got it.
Go back to your dance.

833
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,233
Daisy=
{ Gasping, panting }

834
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:12,836
{ Guests murmur }

835
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,840
Jason= You need to get her
to a doctor.

836
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:19,742
- Jay= She's fine, dad.
- Jerry= Jay, look at her.

837
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:21,945
Jason=
You don't take her, we will.

838
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:23,646
Who is she, Jay?

839
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,582
Jay= It's not what you think,
dad. Leave it alone.

840
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:27,183
Jason= It's obviously much worse
than I think.

841
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,486
Woman= Honey, what is it?

842
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:33,556
Jay= I'm a janitor
in a mental hospital.

843
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:35,258
It's part of my probation.

844
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,560
She's a patient.

845
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,665
- Jason= That's perfect.
- Jay= Yeah, it's perfect.

846
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,968
You okay?

847
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,736
Daisy=
This belongs to you.

848
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:49,706
Woman= You keep it, honey.

849
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:51,608
- You keep it.
- Jason= Keep it?!

850
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,843
I gave that necklace to you!

851
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,712
Woman=
Jason, I want her to have it.

852
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:57,747
Jason= But I gave it to you.
It was an anniversary gift.

853
00:41:57,749 --> 00:42:00,049
Woman= It doesn't matter!
It doesn't matter.

854
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:02,685
Jay= Leave it alone, dad!
Leave it alone!

855
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:05,221
Daisy= Stop!

856
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,293
Jay= Take it, mom.
Here. Take it.

857
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:13,129
Woman=
Oh, good. { Sighs }

858
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,199
{ Thunder rumbles }

859
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:35,652
Daisy=
Are we done with the plan now?

860
00:42:35,654 --> 00:42:38,321
Jay= Yeah, we're done.

861
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:46,262
There's got to be keys
in one of these.

862
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:49,032
Daisy= Why can't we just
fly back on the plane?

863
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:51,167
Jay=
Because I violated my probation

864
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:53,336
and you're
an escaped mental patient.

865
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:56,005
- Daisy= Is that bad?
- Jay= Yeah, that's bad.

866
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:58,341
I'm sure they're gonna be
looking for us by now.

867
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:03,980
Daisy= Hey.

868
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:07,650
What about this big shiny one?

869
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,621
Jay= { Sighs }

870
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,972
{ Beeps }

871
00:43:28,974 --> 00:43:32,175
Jay= { Sighs }

872
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:34,644
Come on.

873
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:36,779
{ Beeps }

874
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,781
God damn it.

875
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,385
Whew. { Smooches }

876
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:44,854
{ Beeps }

877
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:46,990
Yes.

878
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:06,142
Daisy= Look!
These stick to the wall!

879
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,811
{ Gasps }

880
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:11,180
Oh, my God.

881
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:18,755
There's no water in the toilet.

882
00:44:18,757 --> 00:44:20,890
Jay= What?

883
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,203
Stay here.

884
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:36,906
I got to make a phone call.

885
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:40,877
Uh, here.

886
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:43,913
Daisy=
I don't need any money.

887
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:47,050
Jay= There's some
vending machines over there.

888
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:50,053
Just, uh... Here.

889
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:55,291
Take it.

890
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:04,434
Daisy=
It's not gonna be long?

891
00:45:04,436 --> 00:45:08,204
Jay=
No, it's not gonna be too long.

892
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:59,489
See, I'm telling you.
She is a classic, okay?

893
00:45:59,491 --> 00:46:01,357
She really belongs in a museum.

894
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,392
Man= What's the catch?

895
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:06,429
Jay= I can't remember
where I put the title.

896
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,387
Man= Excuse me, miss,

897
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:33,956
but is there something
I can help you with?

898
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:37,560
Daisy= Uh...

899
00:46:37,562 --> 00:46:40,530
My boyfriend is just
making a phone call,

900
00:46:40,532 --> 00:46:43,800
so it shouldn't be long.

901
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:45,334
Man=
How come you got no shoes?

902
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:47,370
There's a rule
here in the station.

903
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:49,138
You got to have shoes.

904
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:54,110
No, it's not like I'm gonna
turn you in or anything.

905
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:57,113
I was just worried
maybe your feet might get cold.

906
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,085
<i>Man over p. A.= Last call
for the h40 to new Orleans.</i>

907
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:05,354
Man=
Are you sure you're okay, baby?

908
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,859
Okay, I'll be right over there.

909
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:12,595
If you need any help,
let me know, okay?

910
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:17,133
Dr. bertleman=
Wheeler, where are you?

911
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:18,868
Jay= Uh, I'd say somewhere

912
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,170
between screwed
and totally fucked.

913
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:23,406
Dr. bertleman= Yeah, no kidding.
Mr. frakel -

914
00:47:23,408 --> 00:47:24,974
Jay= Yeah, well,
frakel's an evil liar.

915
00:47:24,976 --> 00:47:27,844
I saved her from him.
Just ask Mrs. nealberry.

916
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:30,179
Dr. bertleman= Mrs. nealberry
thinks she's in planetary orbit

917
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,014
and that I am from
Alpha centauri.

918
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:33,916
Now, tell me
where miss Kensington is

919
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:35,918
before you make this worse
for yourself.

920
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,354
Jay= She's okay. She's safe.
She's fine.

921
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,590
Dr. bertleman= She is not fine.

922
00:47:40,592 --> 00:47:44,060
She is quite possibly psychotic
or schizophrenic.

923
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:45,595
Jay=
Yeah, I don't know, doc.

924
00:47:45,597 --> 00:47:47,096
I haven't seen her talking
to anyone who's not there

925
00:47:47,098 --> 00:47:48,364
or anything like that.

926
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:49,999
Dr. bertleman=
Listen to me, Wheeler.

927
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:52,368
This girl has spent
virtually her entire life

928
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,036
locked inside the house.

929
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,873
Her social awareness,
her ability to cope

930
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:59,375
are almost certainly
severely impaired.

931
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,244
Jay= Besides the occasional
panic attack

932
00:48:01,246 --> 00:48:04,046
and, you know, not liking shoes,
I think she's highly functional.

933
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,315
I'm actually thinking it's
a little post-traumatic stress.

934
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:09,652
Dr. bertleman= Are you kidding
me? You are not a doctor!

935
00:48:09,654 --> 00:48:14,023
Jay= She's at the greyhound bus
station in shreveport, okay?

936
00:48:14,025 --> 00:48:15,458
That's in Louisiana.

937
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,993
Dr. bertleman=
No, Wheeler, you can't -

938
00:48:16,995 --> 00:48:19,128
{ dial tone }

939
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,930
{ Receiver clicks }

940
00:48:20,932 --> 00:48:22,298
{ Sighs }

941
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,137
Jay= { Sighs }

942
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:34,110
{ Sighs }

943
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,450
God damn it!

944
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,968
Daisy= Um...

945
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:04,373
Can you help me get home?

946
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:08,210
Man= Oh, baby, well,
that depends upon where home is.

947
00:49:08,212 --> 00:49:10,112
Where do you want to go?

948
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:20,990
Jay= { Sighs }

949
00:49:20,992 --> 00:49:23,626
Daisy=
No more phone calls?

950
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:26,329

You know, I can cook,

971
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:21,777
but I just don't know
how to pick things.

a lot of crazy-ass shit,

didn't she?

But she let me watch TV.

But just "TV land" and cmt,
stuff like that.

any of the other channels.

If you never went to school,

how'd you learn
to read and stuff?

Daisy= She taught me.

1029
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:11,914
That was mostly so we could play
scrabble 'cause she loved it.

1030
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:15,351
Except you had to let her win.

1031

Always let her win.

1032

Well, if I'm gonna drive solo,
I got to sleep for a few hours.

- Are we in trouble?
- Jay= No, I-I'm in trouble.

when he saw your lights

1054
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,601
'cause he thinks you're gonna
throw his sorry ass in jail.

with somebody's wife?

1132

Jay= Who, uh -
who told you about that?

She was the wife of a man

who could have made my family
a lot of money.

She also happened to be
very beautiful and very lonely.

01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:23,832
Jay= Yes, I did! Yes, I did!
Of course I did!

1267
01:08:23,834 --> 01:08:25,600
Daisy= { Sobbing }

1268
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:27,368
Jay= Daisy, please!

1269
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:29,471
You're driving in circles!
Like, literally in circles!

1270
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:31,372
{ Tires screeching }

1271
01:08:31,374 --> 01:08:32,640
Daisy, stop!

1272
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:34,509
You're driving like
a crazy person!

1273
01:08:34,511 --> 01:08:36,277
Daisy=
I'm not a crazy person!

1274
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:37,512
{ Sobs }

1275
01:08:37,514 --> 01:08:38,780
Jay= Stop! Daisy!

1276
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:47,288
Daisy= Aah!

1277
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,190
Jay= Daisy!

1278
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:52,694
Daisy!

1279
01:08:52,696 --> 01:08:55,196
Daisy= { Crying }

1280
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:58,299
Jay= It's all right.
It's all right.

1281
01:08:58,301 --> 01:08:59,834
You okay?

1282
01:08:59,836 --> 01:09:01,569
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

1283
01:09:01,571 --> 01:09:06,207
We got to get out of here, okay?

1284
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:19,354
Daisy= We don't have the money
to pay for this.

1285
01:09:19,356 --> 01:09:22,323
Jay=
Can I ask you something?

1286
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:24,659
Did you kill your mother?

1287
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:30,532
Daisy= Yes.

1288
01:09:30,534 --> 01:09:33,601
Jay= { Sighs }

1289
01:09:33,603 --> 01:09:35,570
Were there voices?

1290
01:09:35,572 --> 01:09:38,506
Did voices tell you to do it?

1291
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:41,609
Daisy= No.

1292
01:09:41,611 --> 01:09:44,946
No, the voices -
they didn't tell me things.

1293
01:09:44,948 --> 01:09:47,615
They told my mother things.

1294
01:09:47,617 --> 01:09:50,318
Jay=
So, you don't hear voices.

1295
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:53,922
Your mother did.

1296
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:57,859
Daisy= Yeah.

1297
01:09:57,861 --> 01:10:01,930
Yeah, they used to tell her
things all the time.

1298
01:10:01,932 --> 01:10:05,833
And sometimes
it was just silly stuff, but...

1299
01:10:05,835 --> 01:10:08,303
Mostly it was scary.

1300
01:10:08,305 --> 01:10:11,272
That's why she yelled
all the time.

1301
01:10:11,274 --> 01:10:15,243
But, um...

1302
01:10:15,245 --> 01:10:19,714
One night, she...

1303
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:25,386
She just screamed
and screamed and...

1304
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:28,456
I didn't go to her.

1305
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:39,400
And then when I woke up
in the morning, she was dead.

1306
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:44,606
Jay= Daisy, that is not you
killing your mother.

1307
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:45,907
That is her dying.

1308
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:48,543
You need to stop saying
you killed your mother

1309
01:10:48,545 --> 01:10:50,245
because you didn't.

1310
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:53,948
You didn't kill her.

1311
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:57,252
Daisy= Why do I have to go back
to the hospital then?

1312
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:03,424
Jay=
I never wanted to take you back.

1313
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,563
Daisy=
That's not real though, is it?

1314
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:12,800
That's just pretend.

1315
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:16,437
Jay= { Chuckles }

1316
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:18,640
Yeah.

1317
01:11:18,642 --> 01:11:21,809
It is.

1318
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:24,779
I did want to take you back.

1319
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:28,516
I did.

1320
01:11:28,518 --> 01:11:31,452
But now I don't.

1321
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:34,422
I really don't.

1322
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:42,597
Daisy= Am I gonna have to live
at the hospital?

1323
01:11:42,599 --> 01:11:44,899
Jay= I don't know.

1324
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:48,870
Daisy=
No one's gonna know where I am.

1325
01:11:48,872 --> 01:11:51,673
Jay= I'll know.

1326
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:56,978
- Daisy= You're not gonna forget?
- Jay= I'm not gonna forget.

1327
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:57,472
Mr. phelpmitter= Daisy?

1328
01:12:57,474 --> 01:12:59,741
Hey, Daisy?

1329
01:12:59,743 --> 01:13:01,743
Hey, Daisy? What happened?

1330
01:13:01,745 --> 01:13:03,411
Mrs. nealberry= Daisy.

1331
01:13:03,413 --> 01:13:06,814
Daisy, it's me, Mary Beth.

1332
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:08,916
Mary Beth nealberry, honey.

1333
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:19,527
Woman= { Sighs }

1334
01:13:19,529 --> 01:13:22,930
He's in
the Los Angeles county jail.

1335
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:29,771
Jason= { Sighs }

1336
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,777
Woman= Jason...

1337
01:13:35,779 --> 01:13:38,946
There was a time when you were
as reckless as he is,

1338
01:13:38,948 --> 01:13:40,615
and who bailed you out?

1339
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:45,853
Your father.

1340
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:53,127
{ Buzzer sounds }

1341
01:13:53,129 --> 01:13:55,463
{ Indistinct conversations }

1342
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:07,742
Jay= Who posted my bail?

1343
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:00,728
{ Buzzer sounds }

1344
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,597
- Man= I'm sorry.
- Jay= I got to see her, man.

1345
01:15:02,599 --> 01:15:04,065
Man=
I just don't see it happening.

1346
01:15:04,067 --> 01:15:06,901
Dr. bertleman= Mr. Wheeler,
you have a better chance

1347
01:15:06,903 --> 01:15:10,004
of being elected mayor than
ever getting in here again...

1348
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:13,040
...which is to say none.

1349
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:32,560
{ Car horns honking }

1350
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:42,236
{ Bell dinging }

1351
01:15:59,655 --> 01:16:01,289
Guard= Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?

1352
01:16:01,291 --> 01:16:02,757
Get off the tracks!

1353
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:10,565
Margie=
How we feeling today?

1354
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:13,568
Daisy=
I don't want any more pills.

1355
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:15,303
I just want to see Jay.

1356
01:16:15,305 --> 01:16:18,739
Margie= You can't, honey.
He's in jail.

1357
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:21,676
Man= No, he was here
this morning.

1358
01:16:21,678 --> 01:16:24,245
Margie= Either way,
he doesn't work here anymore.

1359
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:25,746
Daisy= I have to go then.

1360
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:27,615
Margie=
No. No, Daisy, no.

1361
01:16:27,617 --> 01:16:29,283
Daisy= No, I promise I'm only
gonna leave for a little bit.

1362
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:32,219
No, it's okay
'cause I'm not crazy. It's okay.

1363
01:16:32,221 --> 01:16:34,088
Margie= It's all right.
You just need to calm down.

1364
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:36,090
Daisy= No, no,
I'm not having an attack!

1365
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:40,194
I just want to see my boyfriend!

1366
01:16:40,196 --> 01:16:42,763
Dr. bertleman=
Well, that was quite a stunt.

1367
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:44,031
Jay= Yeah.

1368
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:45,232
Dr. bertleman=
But I'm releasing you.

1369
01:16:45,234 --> 01:16:46,701
Jay=
You can't. I'm suicidal.

1370
01:16:46,703 --> 01:16:48,202
- Dr. bertleman= Bullshit.
- Jay= I'm serious.

1371
01:16:48,204 --> 01:16:50,171
Dr. bertleman= Then I'll put you
on suicide precaution.

1372
01:16:50,173 --> 01:16:52,640
You'll be in a locked ward.

1373
01:16:52,642 --> 01:16:53,908
Jay= She's not sick, doc.

1374
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:55,176
The voices are not
in Daisy's head.

1375
01:16:55,178 --> 01:16:56,711
They were in her mother's head.

1376
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:01,282
Dr. bertleman=
She told you that?

1377
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:14,261
Mr. phelpmitter= Dr. bertleman?

1378
01:17:14,263 --> 01:17:16,797
Dr. bertleman=
Yes, Mr. phelpmitter?

1379
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:19,834
Mr. phelpmitter= Why won't you
let Mr. Wheeler see his Daisy?

1380
01:17:19,836 --> 01:17:21,636
Dr. bertleman= Mr. phelpmitter,

1381
01:17:21,638 --> 01:17:23,871
I can't discuss another patient
with you.

1382
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:29,377
Mr. phelpmitter= They're holding
her against her will,

1383
01:17:29,379 --> 01:17:31,078
aren't they?

1384
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,848
They've got a computer
with everything about you on it.

1385
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:35,216
They know about you and Daisy.

1386
01:17:35,218 --> 01:17:36,684
They know everything.

1387
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:57,438
Margie=
Oh, look. Beautiful.

1388
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:02,176
What you got?
Come on.

1389
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:05,379
Man=
Where the hell you been?

1390
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:08,416
Margie= You okay?

1391
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:15,389
Jay= { Grunts }

1392
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,862
{ Choking }

1393
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:36,243
Jay= { Panting }

1394
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:54,028
Dr. bertleman= For once
in your life, don't talk.

1395
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:56,297
Jay= Okay.

1396
01:18:56,299 --> 01:18:57,498
Dr. bertleman= That's talking.

1397
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,166
Jay= Sorry.

1398
01:18:59,168 --> 01:19:01,368
Dr. bertleman= { Sighs }

1399
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:06,907
I came to apologize.

1400
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:10,811
Jay= For what?

1401
01:19:10,813 --> 01:19:14,815
Dr. bertleman=
You were right about frakel.

1402
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:19,253
And about Daisy's mother.

1403
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:24,492
She was diagnosed schizophrenic
with extreme paranoia

1404
01:19:24,494 --> 01:19:27,795
by several doctors.

1405
01:19:27,797 --> 01:19:29,063
It's remarkable, really,

1406
01:19:29,065 --> 01:19:31,031
she was able to raise a daughter
at all.

1407
01:19:31,033 --> 01:19:32,366
Jay=
So, you can release her?

1408
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:34,902
Dr. bertleman=
I need to keep an eye on her.

1409
01:19:34,904 --> 01:19:36,504
If all goes well,

1410
01:19:36,506 --> 01:19:38,873
she'll transition to a group
home in two or three months.

1411
01:19:38,875 --> 01:19:40,274
Jay=
No, that's too long to wait.

1412
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:42,443
Dr. bertleman=
She'll be all right.

1413
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:44,979
Jay=
I wasn't talking about her.

1414
01:19:44,981 --> 01:19:49,016
Dr. bertleman=
Well, there's nothing I can do.

1415
01:19:49,018 --> 01:19:52,953
Jay= Of course there is.

1416
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:54,955
{ Telephone rings }

1417
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:57,324
Dr. bertleman= So, you wanted
to know about Mr. Wheeler.

1418
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:02,863
You like Mr. Wheeler?

1419
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:07,268
Daisy= I-I don't like him.
I love him.

1420
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:11,539
Dr. bertleman= Have you ever
been in love before, Daisy?

1421
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,409
Daisy= No.

1422
