1
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:23,244
<i>Oh, there I am.</i>

2
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:28,020
<i>Hi, I'm Rosemarie DeWitt and
I play Rachel in Rachel Getting Married.</i>

3
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:41,096
<i>And I like our cool title sequence.</i>

4
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,976
I want my fucking Zippo now.

5
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:56,446
- Walter, that is a behavior that will get you...
- Fuck you!

6
00:01:56,749 --> 00:02:01,948
<i>Jonathan had showed us
a movie, After the Wedding.</i>

7
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:07,954
<i>And he said it was sort of a leaping off point
for him, you know, inspiration wise.</i>

8
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,454
<i>But none of us were allowed
to go behind the monitors</i>

9
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:14,328
<i>to see what the film actually looked like
while we were shooting.</i>

10
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,528
<i>So once it started I realized we
weren't making, sort of,</i>

11
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:22,665
<i>the more traditional family,
kind of, Family Stone movie.</i>

12
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:27,940
<i>We were really in the world
of this jagged, handheld,</i>

13
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:32,139
<i>you know, stark world.</i>

14
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,622
<i>So, I remember this opening shot, I was like,
"Wow. He really did make this movie. "</i>

15
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:43,922
It was a mistake. I'm lucky I didn't get fired.
We've discussed this.

16
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,662
Hey. Here you are.

17
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,124
I thought you were going to
abandon me in rehab.

18
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,032
- No.
- It's 10:30. You're half an hour late.

19
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,729
I was just standing out here
with these lunatics.

20
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,535
- Oh, my God, you look so great.
- So do you, darling.

21
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:59,442
- Can I take care of that? Hi, Paul Buchman.
- Rosa. We met last time you came up.

22
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,638
<i>Jenny's script is so good</i>

23
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:04,706
<i>because I feel, like, right off the bat,
these scenes to me feel very improvised.</i>

24
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,615
<i>And they're saying them word for word,
at this point anyway.</i>

25
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:12,122
Kym. Good luck to you.

26
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,023
Thank you.

27
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,829
All right. Hey, where is everybody?

28
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,398
- Hey, Carol.
- Hello, Kym.

29
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,659
Where is everybody? Where's Rachel?

30
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,598
She's back at the house getting ready.

31
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,637
There is so much going on at the house,
I cannot tell you, dear.

32
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:29,333
And you know your sister's doing
everything herself.

33
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,240
My sister's bending the environment
to her will? Really?

34
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,178
There's no wedding planners
or anything like that. It's just her

35
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,079
and Sidney and a whole lot of their friends.
And she is so thrilled

36
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,947
- that you're coming home.
- Great.

37
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:47,291
<i>And I think this is where it begins,
that Declan Quinn, our fabulous DP,</i>

38
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:53,332
<i>becomes truly another character in the
movie because he's in every scene with us,</i>

39
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,525
<i>you know, now in the car.</i>

40
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:02,841
<i>And I feel like Jonathan just gave him
the same free rein he gave all of us,</i>

41
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:07,640
<i>which was, you know,
"Follow the impulses in your body. "</i>

42
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,982
<i>You know, feel where the most energy is
and the most information</i>

43
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,113
<i>and just shoot that
rather than planning shots.</i>

44
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,889
<i>And, you know, he's really...</i>

45
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:27,524
<i>His perspective is just
a real human perspective.</i>

46
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,702
<i>I love Bill Irwin.</i>

47
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,868
<i>Nachtmahr was a nightmare so bad
it's in German.</i>

48
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:35,941
I see.

49
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,909
Rachel must be, like, totally freaking out.
Is she too tense?

50
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:44,046
<i>I just feel like none of these shots
were planned, it was just wherever,</i>

51
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:48,579
<i>wherever Declan felt
the most interesting thing was happening.</i>

52
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:49,916
<i>That's where the camera would go.</i>

53
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,015
No offense, Dad, but you never thought
that was a problem for her.

54
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,590
So I'm really looking forward
to seeing Mom.

55
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:02,226
You'll see your mom tonight and Andrew
at the rehearsal dinner.

56
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,396
Well, maybe I'll head over there,
to her house, after I see Rachel.

57
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,599
Well, I don't know.

58
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,113
Can we pull over, please?

59
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,443
I'm sorry, I feel nauseous,
and I need something to drink.

60
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,787
<i>That's one of my favorite lines in the movie.</i>

61
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:27,120
I prefer Pepsi from the fountain.

62
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,990
<i>Hey, didn't I see you on Cops?</i>

63
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,167
<i>This house is so amazing,
it was so sprawling and cavernous.</i>

64
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,732
<i>And we pretty much did just live in it.
No one would go back to their trailers.</i>

65
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,506
<i>We would just arrive in the morning</i>

66
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:52,277
<i>and then, sort of, live here
with all these people all the time.</i>

67
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:56,980
<i>And kind of get to know each other, and
become a family and really plan a wedding.</i>

68
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,786
Hi, gentlemen.

69
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:10,826
<i>And I love this, I love how the characters
are introduced and they're not explained,</i>

70
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:17,442
<i>that you just, kind of, get to know the family
as you would if you showed up to,</i>

71
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,276
<i>you know, witness their wedding.</i>

72
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:36,919
<i>This for me was the hardest scene to shoot
in the entire movie.</i>

73
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:43,291
<i>Just because it was the first day of
shooting for Anisa and I.</i>

74
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,735
<i>And I think we weren't sure
what world we were in.</i>

75
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:54,244
<i>And, you know, there's supposed to be
all this history</i>

76
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:58,515
<i>and Annie and I should be able
to finish each other's sentences.</i>

77
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:04,115
<i>And it's, you know, the second time we've
been around each other in our lives</i>

78
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,521
<i>and it's like game on.</i>

79
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,254
<i>I think Tim did an amazing job
editing this scene</i>

80
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:14,299
<i>because I think we were, kind of,
all over the place and terrified.</i>

81
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,799
So what's the deal?
Are you an actual shrink yet?

82
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,172
<i>And we were just trying to figure out where
is this camera going to be</i>

83
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,801
<i>and what exactly is it shooting.</i>

84
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:29,245
<i>Because it felt like it was
flying all over the room.</i>

85
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,544
I will have my PhD in a year and a half...

86
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:39,417
<i>I remember Annie coming in and just, God,
firing on all cylinders</i>

87
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:43,825
<i>and rolling all over my dress
and on the bed with her cigarette.</i>

88
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,027
<i>And I remember feeling like,
"Oh, God. I'm so uptight and tense</i>

89
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:53,071
<i>"and I'm just gonna singlehandedly ruin this
entire film. " And then I got home that night</i>

90
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,265
<i>and thought, "Oh, that's right,
that's the dynamic. "</i>

91
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,468
<i>When Kym walks in, she takes
all the oxygen out of the room</i>

92
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,342
<i>and everyone feels like
they don't know how to be.</i>

93
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,472
I know.

94
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,542
And she confessed to you
her secret Elvis Stojko fantasy.

95
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,711
- How did you...
- What?

96
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,221
- I spied on you.
- Elvis Stojko, the figure skater?

97
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,019
Oh, my God!

98
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,729
<i>I think the set is so incredible in this movie,</i>

99
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:25,737
<i>because I never, for once, didn't think that
we were living in a house like this.</i>

100
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,999
<i>And I love that decision to shoot this
in the parents' master bedroom</i>

101
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:32,077
<i>and have the girls so comfortable there.</i>

102
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,443
<i>Like you really get that
they grew up in this house.</i>

103
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,346
By Barry. By Barry!

104
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,784
And just when Barry gets to...

105
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:47,614
<i>Watching this scene,
I love that we didn't rehearse.</i>

106
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:54,925
<i>Because Anne and I are just... All this
Elvis Stojko, Barry Manilow stuff is just,</i>

107
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,533
<i>you know, her having a great impulse</i>

108
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:01,767
<i>and me trying to come find her
in the scene and discover each other.</i>

109
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,806
- But he doesn't care.
- Right. Oh, my God!

110
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,847
I'm going to go downstairs and find Olive
and get some unconditional love.

111
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,438
You look great.

112
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,280
- Welcome home.
- Thank you. Emma.

113
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:23,428
<i>So brave that her character goes
right to Ethan's room, I think.</i>

114
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:27,295
<i>I don't think I went in there
until the last day of shooting.</i>

115
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:33,461
Speaking of dogs, when am I going to
meet this fiancé of yours, anyhow?

116
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:39,172
<i>I think it says so much about her character</i>

117
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,179
<i>and where she's at
and how hard she's trying.</i>

118
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,250
<i>And you can hear Zafer on the violin.</i>

119
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,886
<i>It was so amazing,
the way the music worked in this film.</i>

120
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:02,958
<i>I mean, I think they were really improvising
and composing all on the spot.</i>

121
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,436
<i>And they would play something and then
Jonathan would go downstairs and say,</i>

122
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,133
<i>"Could it be a little bit more melancholy?"</i>

123
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,233
<i>And, you know, no one knew what anyone
else was doing in another room</i>

124
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:16,281
<i>and yet somehow it was all, kind of,
seamlessly coming together.</i>

125
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,888
<i>This is where the shot, to me, feels like a
horror movie, but I guess there is some,</i>

126
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,425
<i>you know, underlying horror that we've yet
to discover.</i>

127
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,642
<i>I love the way
Jonathan lets all this unfold, too.</i>

128
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,584
<i>Because you don't know
who those two people are yet,</i>

129
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,177
<i>and yet they're invoking so much.</i>

130
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:59,155
<i>I think almost like this movie is even better
in the second viewing,</i>

131
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,453
<i>once you see all the pieces.</i>

132
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,658
- It's too hot.
- I don't eat gluten, Paul.

133
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,561
- Two...
- May I have one, too?

134
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,759
Yeah. You don't eat what, dear?

135
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,233
Gluten.

136
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,498
- Where's Kym?
- Besides, I'm in my dress.

137
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,198
You're in your dress? Let me see it.

138
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,706
- No!
- No!

139
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,710
- All right. Okay.
- Come on, Olive.

140
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,640
- What can I get for you, Kymmie?
- Actually, I'm late for a meeting.

141
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,685
And I have to pee into a cup
and register as a general biohazard.

142
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,188
<i>These kind of scenes were so much fun
because they were just not blocked.</i>

143
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:36,523
<i>You just got to live in the house and
somehow Declan would come find you</i>

144
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,120
<i>and you didn't have to
worry about whether...</i>

145
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:43,565
<i>The house was always, kind of,
lit to be shot in any room</i>

146
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,467
<i>and, like, Anne could just come
flying down the stairs and they could stop</i>

147
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,063
<i>and have a conversation at any point.</i>

148
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,700
<i>And it's so liberating for an actor.</i>

149
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,309
Hi. Hi, I'm here to pee into a cup.

150
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:06,381
<i>Anne Hathaway is so amazing in this movie.</i>

151
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,161
- The meetings are over in the other building.
- I know that.

152
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,662
Someone will be right with you. Have a seat.

153
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,009
<i>What was so great about
the way we shot this, too,</i>

154
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,573
<i>was that these two worlds
really were separate.</i>

155
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:35,780
<i>You know, like I never saw any of this</i>

156
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:40,449
<i>until I sat in a movie theater and watched it.
You know, the 12-step meetings.</i>

157
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,552
<i>And I just feel like that also
fits the dynamic of the family.</i>

158
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,256
<i>That they just have no idea
what this poor girl is going through</i>

159
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:53,805
<i>and how hard she's fighting
to heal and forgive herself and...</i>

160
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:02,546
<i>Jonathan got all these great New York
actors, Matt Stadelmann and Paul Sparks.</i>

161
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,853
<i>Oh, that guy, Darrell Larson's
a great director. Just all these great artists.</i>

162
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:14,651
<i>And he put them in the movie to, sort of, see
what kind of chemical reaction happened.</i>

163
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,888
<i>This guy's so cool, Pastor Mel,
and he's the real deal, you know,</i>

164
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,828
<i>he's one of those guys</i>

165
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,159
<i>who is doing this everyday in real life.
He's not an actor.</i>

166
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,802
<i>And that was an interesting thing, too,</i>

167
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:32,469
<i>to be working with actors
and then people who were not actors</i>

168
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:36,878
<i>and hoping that the truth
and the reality all matched each other.</i>

169
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,473
<i>That nothing seemed performative</i>

170
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:46,215
<i>or, you know, too slick, because
these people were really real and raw.</i>

171
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:52,255
You know, and people helping me
and providing for me...

172
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,832
You know, you relapse,
you got to start all over again.

173
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,562
And, man, I got tired of starting over again.

174
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,195
You know, it was dramatic.
You know, there's a lot of, you know...

175
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,332
It's ups and downs
and it's crazy, and then...

176
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:07,276
And just recently,
there's something, you know...

177
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:11,577
I can feel myself almost, like,
missing the drama sometimes. Like, I'm...

178
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,848
It gets so boring sometimes.

179
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:25,088
You know I used to say I'm not an addict.
And it took me years to say I was an addict.

180
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:29,224
Then I spent years, like... That's all I was.

181
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,803
You know? I was just an addict.

182
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,771
<i>I love the way Jonathan casts
because I think all these people...</i>

183
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,273
<i>It seems so real to me after
the NA meetings I sat through</i>

184
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,939
<i>and the Al-Anon meetings I sat through.</i>

185
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,077
All of us have felt that way at some time.

186
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,315
But I want to encourage you.
You're doing well.

187
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:56,486
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

188
00:14:56,595 --> 00:15:01,157
the courage to change the things I can
and the wisdom to know the difference.

189
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,566
And it says keep coming back,
'cause it works, if you work it.

190
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,537
Well, thanks a lot. I'll see you next time.

191
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:20,050
Kymmie! Carol, she's here.

192
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:24,247
Kymmie! I got a sandwich for you, darling.
It's meat loaf.

193
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,490
- Hi, dear.
- Hey.

194
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,271
- Quite a ride, huh?
- Yep.

195
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,704
- Meat loaf.
- Look at that.

196
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,002
- Yeah.
- Yummy.

197
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,508
- Okay.
- Wow. Thank you.

198
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,703
- You're welcome.
- That's big.

199
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,110
I'm so glad you're here, darling.
I'm so glad you're back.

200
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,111
<i>I had such an amazing
take on this character.</i>

201
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:56,552
<i>I read it and the father
seemed just so deeply sad,</i>

202
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,448
<i>you know, after losing his son.</i>

203
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:04,722
<i>Just deeply sad and sort of
unable to go on and you know...</i>

204
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:09,494
<i>I'm sure most of you know that Bill Irwin
is this masterful clown, does clown work.</i>

205
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:14,038
<i>And it's amazing for me to see the joy,</i>

206
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,474
<i>the enormous joy
he brings to this character.</i>

207
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,908
<i>Even if it's just a cover a lot of the time.</i>

208
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,276
<i>It's so different than
what it was on the page.</i>

209
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,510
- How are you?
- Good.

210
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,775
<i>All these actors, they just brought...</i>

211
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,652
<i>They took an amazing script
and elevated it so much.</i>

212
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,123
I think that we have started a new tradition.

213
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,394
- That's what I think, yeah.
- Yeah. What's that?

214
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,164
I think it's the best man
and the maid of honor

215
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,171
sneaking off to get it on,

216
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,741
while the rest of the wedding party
very happily

217
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,403
and furiously plans for the big event.

218
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,718
<i>I love that so much
of the action in the movie,</i>

219
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,788
<i>the sex and the fighting,
happen in the first half hour.</i>

220
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:08,121
<i>And it's not the way a lot of scripts,</i>

221
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:12,491
<i>films kind of build to this crazy climax
and then there you have it.</i>

222
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,725
<i>And then you resolve it neatly
and tie it in a bow.</i>

223
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,467
<i>I feel like so much of the chaos
starts right out of the gate</i>

224
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:25,669
<i>and then it's like, "How do we plug into
each other and how do we deal?"</i>

225
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,878
Do you love it?

226
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:33,014
<i>And there's so much tension
in all these scenes.</i>

227
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,848
Isn't it beautiful?
We should just cover your tattoo.

228
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,387
What?

229
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,219
Nothing, nothing. I just really like the gray.

230
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,450
Of course you do.

231
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,687
<i>This is another scene early on.</i>

232
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:47,562
<i>'Cause Jonathan didn't tend to say
a lot when we were working.</i>

233
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,261
<i>He really let us play
and find things and experiment.</i>

234
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:56,205
<i>And this was a scene where
he really directed us to all go at each other.</i>

235
00:17:56,308 --> 00:18:00,642
<i>And I remember thinking,
"This early, this early on we're going to...</i>

236
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:05,506
<i>"We're going to start here?
Where will we have to go?"</i>

237
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,551
<i>But we just trusted him.</i>

238
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:12,087
Why is Emma the maid of honor?
Why am I not the maid of honor?

239
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,420
Because.

240
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,728
What does that mean?

241
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,798
Because I wasn't entirely sure when
you were coming or if you'd even make it.

242
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,803
<i>Most scenes we didn't do a ton of takes,
this one we did a ton of takes</i>

243
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,975
<i>and by the end of it...
Annie's really present as an actress</i>

244
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,510
<i>and by the end of it, she just looked at me
and started crying and said,</i>

245
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,046
<i>"Can you please stop yelling at me. "</i>

246
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:40,141
<i>And I realized that we were
really inhabiting these people's lives.</i>

247
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,650
...at all times because he's never
resolved his own trust issues.

248
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,814
- That's odd.
- You know what? Shut the fuck up!

249
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,414
- Blow me!
- Okay.

250
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,625
- Leave Dad alone.
- I'd love to. I want to, okay?

251
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,254
He won't let me. I just...

252
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:57,495
I can feel him watching me all the time.
And Carol, and you guys, too.

253
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,503
Because we have nothing better
to think about.

254
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,403
You know, everyone in the house is
looking at me like I'm a visiting sociopath.

255
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:06,103
I mean, seriously, what do you expect
me to do, burn the house down?

256
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,272
That was a mattress fire. That was
not even at home. It was at a sleepover.

257
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,315
Okay, you know what? Fine.
Fuck you both. You win.

258
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,611
I'm going to get "hazmat" tattooed
across my forehead for you people.

259
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,050
- Will that make you happy?
- God, you're like a harpy!

260
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,621
Okay, is being my maid of honor
that important to you?

261
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,316
Because I didn't think you gave a shit.
I'm sorry.

262
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,286
How could you fucking say that to me?

263
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,793
Jesus. Emma.

264
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,090
Emma, would you be horribly offended
and hurt

265
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,568
if I asked you step down as maid of honor?

266
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,934
<i>I love that Anisa doesn't back down.</i>

267
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,441
<i>I love that the character of Emma doesn't
back down from Kym</i>

268
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:39,976
<i>because everyone, sort of, has to.</i>

269
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:45,675
<i>And we so need her to be Rachel's advocate
and she does such a beautiful job.</i>

270
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,781
- Okay, fine. Fine.
- Not really.

271
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:56,259
You can have it. The crown is yours.
First runner-up.

272
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,352
Thank you, Emma, thank you.

273
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,158
- You know what?
- Everything is not about you, Kym.

274
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,393
No, it's not about me. It's about sisterhood.

275
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:06,403
You're such a paragon of sisterhood.
Hooray for sisterhood!

276
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,904
You know what? Sisterhood conquers all.

277
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,531
You know, I can really see rehab
has done wonders for you, Kym.

278
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:16,136
<i>Okay, now we get into the rehearsal dinner
which as an actor,</i>

279
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:20,681
<i>this was just so cool
because it was as if we just...</i>

280
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,617
<i>And the same thing with the wedding,</i>

281
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:27,055
<i>we sort of just got to show up
and experience it.</i>

282
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,956
<i>Like we walked into this hall.</i>

283
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:35,932
<i>And, I mean, all of this
was a surprise to all of us.</i>

284
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,935
<i>We didn't know that we were
going to be so wildly entertained.</i>

285
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:44,202
<i>And here we have Jonathan's son Brooklyn
and Barry jamming out.</i>

286
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:48,268
<i>And here we are listening
to what will be at our wedding.</i>

287
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,904
<i>And we just had no idea.</i>

288
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:54,543
<i>So, really our only obligation as actors
was to come and enjoy it.</i>

289
00:20:55,487 --> 00:21:00,720
<i>Of course, you know with all the back story
about all the deep sadness</i>

290
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:06,059
<i>and Mom not showing up
till two hours in and what not.</i>

291
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,392
<i>And it really gives the actors, you know...</i>

292
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,632
<i>A lot of scenes ended up on the cutting
room floor 'cause we just didn't need them.</i>

293
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:19,040
<i>But there are scenes like this where
you really get to know everybody,</i>

294
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:22,113
<i>even if things got cut out later.</i>

295
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,949
<i>And these are very improvised.</i>

296
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:32,652
<i>Well this whole scene, I don't know
that this was even in the original script.</i>

297
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,054
<i>Paul Lazar, there really is...</i>

298
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:40,162
<i>You could make a movie just about all the
amazing artists in this movie.</i>

299
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,096
<i>And people who...</i>

300
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:48,038
<i>Like Paul is such an
interesting director and actor.</i>

301
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,437
<i>- Rachel
- Sidney</i>

302
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,701
<i>- Rachel
- Sidney</i>

303
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,867
<i>- Rachel
- Sidney</i>

304
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,274
<i>- Rachel
- Sidney</i>

305
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,423
<i>You know I tapped her on the shoulder.
I was like...</i>

306
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:11,086
<i>So amazing to listen to these speeches
and learn about your character,</i>

307
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:14,495
<i>because these actors
were asked to give toasts</i>

308
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,261
<i>and talk about their relationship
to the bride and groom.</i>

309
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:22,363
<i>And then all of a sudden your world just
gets so much more rich and it expands.</i>

310
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:35,077
<i>There's no acting in these scenes.
These people are singing and jamming</i>

311
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:39,180
<i>and we're just literally
really blown away by them.</i>

312
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:49,896
<i>You know, Paul, you've been such
a great friend of mine over the years.</i>

313
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:55,999
<i>I mean Donald Harrison Jr.
Should be an actor full time, he's amazing.</i>

314
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:02,042
<i>Watching everyone grow up. Rachel. Kym.</i>

315
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,576
<i>And now Rachel's getting married.
Rachel getting married.</i>

316
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,450
Yeah.

317
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:17,819
<i>But we also need to
honor my little friend Ethan</i>

318
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:22,263
<i>who's gone on to another plane now,
you know.</i>

319
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,801
<i>But his spirit is here
and he lives in our heart...</i>

320
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,339
<i>Again, we had to do
so few takes on these scenes</i>

321
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:32,771
<i>because we didn't know
what the other actors were going to do,</i>

322
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:36,644
<i>once they got up there, or say,
so, everyone's reactions are,</i>

323
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,314
<i>you know, unplanned.</i>

324
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,618
<i>And there was no worry
about anything getting stale</i>

325
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,887
<i>because we did it once
and we never saw it coming.</i>

326
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:54,755
<i>That's the A-side.
The B-side is Sidney loves Rachel.</i>

327
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:13,015
<i>It was also
a really cool experience to have...</i>

328
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:20,615
<i>Well, to A, work with Tunde
who's this just soulful, awesome guy.</i>

329
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,690
<i>And to have no time to rehearse
or build this whole relationship</i>

330
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,765
<i>or even this physical relationship
with each other,</i>

331
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:31,165
<i>and have to really discover
each other while the camera was rolling.</i>

332
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:34,705
<i>And you go in thinking
it's gonna be one thing like, you know,</i>

333
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,740
<i>you're going to have this crazy chemistry</i>

334
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,140
<i>and then we were a little awkward
and a little tentative around each other.</i>

335
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:44,306
<i>And then that became Rachel and Sidney.</i>

336
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,043
<i>But it's fun to find that</i>

337
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:52,319
<i>and let it be what it wants to be
and tell the story that it wants to tell.</i>

338
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:55,985
<i>And of course, we had to eat
lots of Indian food in this scene.</i>

339
00:24:56,161 --> 00:25:01,326
<i>This is another scene,
I think maybe we did three takes</i>

340
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,469
<i>of the toast portion of the rehearsal dinner.</i>

341
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:09,373
<i>And they were 45 minutes apiece.</i>

342
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,736
<i>And the whole movie was handheld.</i>

343
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:17,110
<i>You know, this one scene we actually had to
put them on bungee cords because I think...</i>

344
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:20,983
<i>I don't know that Declan's
neck and shoulders could have handled it.</i>

345
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,681
<i>So they were on bungee cords
to create the feel of being handheld.</i>

346
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,651
- I don't think so.
- You always pretend you don't know people.

347
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,888
- Watch my dress.
- Is it 'cause you owe them money?

348
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:35,227
I'm sorry, family members only
in this discussion.

349
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,496
Speaking of which, where is Mom?
Where's our mother?

350
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,865
How can she not be here?
I haven't seen her since I've been home.

351
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,134
She called a couple of times
and she said she's running late,

352
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,176
- but she should be here soon.
- God.

353
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:49,213
Kieran, do you want
any of this saag paneer?

354
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,577
No, thanks. Is there any krill?

355
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:57,219
- I'm kidding. Sorry, it's a joke.
- It just went over my head.

356
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,790
I can't believe Mom would be late
for my release back into the wild.

357
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,825
<i>All this was scripted.</i>

358
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,794
<i>But it was amazing to then effortlessly
be able to jump into sort of, improv.</i>

359
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,837
<i>Because most of these speeches,
with the exception of the maid of honor,</i>

360
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:18,103
<i>the best man and obviously Kym,
they were in the script,</i>

361
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,542
<i>and everybody else who jumped up and
spoke did it as they felt moved to speak.</i>

362
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:27,781
<i>Which again is a gift to an actor.
It just kept everyone on their toes</i>

363
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,587
<i>and we all gave speeches,
they're not all in the movie.</i>

364
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,623
<i>Maybe they'll be on the DVD.</i>

365
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:36,752
Now I just help Sidney out
with the business side of his stuff.

366
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,192
Sweet.

367
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:48,365
<i>What's so great, too,
about the way this was shot...</i>

368
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:52,239
<i>I think maybe we had
five or six cameras going in this scene.</i>

369
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,213
<i>Some were camcorders,
some were production cameras,</i>

370
00:26:56,314 --> 00:27:00,648
<i>some were the wedding videographer.</i>

371
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:05,121
<i>You know, you miss all this, like, the whole
relationship, like our parents, you know.</i>

372
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,920
<i>The amazing Debra Winger
and Bill Irwin were...</i>

373
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,461
<i>The looks between
the two of them, you know,</i>

374
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,199
<i>we weren't privy to
as the actors in the scene.</i>

375
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,758
<i>And then seeing the movie we were like,
"Wow, this world's so complicated. "</i>

376
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:23,200
<i>And all these introductions
were really nerve-racking</i>

377
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,003
<i>in that I had just met these actors</i>

378
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,604
<i>and then introducing Carol-Jean
and John Anthony to my parents</i>

379
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:32,478
<i>and hoping I get their names right.</i>

380
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:33,985
<i>And Kyrah.</i>

381
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,679
- Pleasure.
- Don't you steal her.

382
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:40,485
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you. Congratulations.

383
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,082
- Thank you.
- And this is Grandma.

384
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,218
- Hello.
- Emma!

385
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,235
Mom, you look so great.
Really, you look amazing.

386
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:55,568
Honey, don't smoke. I don't think it's...
Can you smoke here?

387
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,802
- Yeah, yeah, totally. It's a private party.
- This is the best man, Kieran.

388
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,572
- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you. I'm Kieran.

389
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,205
How's Grandma?
Is she still surly and irascible?

390
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,306
She's great. You know Grandma.
She sends her love.

391
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:07,908
- Great, same.
- You want to sit?

392
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,044
Go put the cigarette out,
'cause I don't think it's fine.

393
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,588
- Sit.
- Just put it out.

394
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,817
- Just put it out.
- Okay. It's going out.

395
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:22,130
The father of the bride and the father of
the groom are not supposed to do anything

396
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,895
but grin like jack-o'- lanterns
and write checks...

397
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:30,233
<i>I think one of the really cool things about
getting to write a toast for the wedding</i>

398
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,105
<i>or in my case, I got to write
my vows for the wedding,</i>

399
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,371
<i>is it really...</i>

400
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:41,952
<i>made you think about
the themes in the wedding.</i>

401
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,385
<i>Love and...</i>

402
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:52,422
<i>marriage and, you know, what those things
mean to you, like in a deeply personal way.</i>

403
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:57,526
<i>It was really awesome to be able to get up
there and say your own words</i>

404
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:02,197
<i>once in a while, in the midst
of this amazing script that Jenny wrote.</i>

405
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,305
<i>I love Bill's toast.</i>

406
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,177
...and its complicated tax structure.

407
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:11,504
We just met.

408
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,244
I just want you to know
how blessed we are to be

409
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:18,516
joining forces with you, and we've just met,
but I'm going to tell you, we love you.

410
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:28,456
<i>Well, I have known Sidney for...</i>

411
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:35,167
<i>What is it? Fifteen, 20, 20...
Most of my life, most of my life.</i>

412
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,036
<i>He's been a great friend.</i>

413
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,371
<i>He's been with me through thick and thin.</i>

414
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,605
<i>And</i>

415
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:47,685
<i>I'll tell you,
sometimes it's gotten very, very thin.</i>

416
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:53,289
<i>I love this sequence of the rehearsal dinner.</i>

417
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:59,786
<i>You know, I think on the page it was
best man, maid of honor, Kym's speech</i>

418
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:05,666
<i>and then maybe we would have cut to
the fight afterwards, the aftermath.</i>

419
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,331
<i>And in this Jonathan,
by letting us really live it</i>

420
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:13,410
<i>and letting it really be
a rehearsal dinner the way it would be...</i>

421
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:18,008
<i>Kym gives her speech and then...
And it's horrifying.</i>

422
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:22,109
<i>And everybody's in pain
and struggling with the fact</i>

423
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,714
<i>that she just gave an amends speech
at her sister's rehearsal dinner.</i>

424
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:33,355
<i>And then he cuts to someone talking about
getting stoned with Sidney in Jamaica</i>

425
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:39,096
<i>and then a very drunk guest,
Beau, you know,</i>

426
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:42,736
<i>just riffing about love
and everybody finds it hilarious.</i>

427
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:48,746
<i>And you really start to feel how isolated
and alienated Kym is in this world.</i>

428
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:55,719
<i>And the struggle, you know, of the addict
to stay sober and stay on course.</i>

429
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,982
<i>But I think by shooting this way...</i>

430
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:03,390
<i>By shooting so many movies,
I think we had about 15 movies in here,</i>

431
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:08,828
<i>you really get to tell something
that's really true.</i>

432
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:13,461
So I've known the bride her entire life.
Not biblically speaking.

433
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:18,542
Except for that time we French-kissed
at Evan Yasky's party in ninth grade.

434
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:19,803
Stop!

435
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,643
<i>God, these actors are all so good.</i>

436
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:28,344
<i>Watching this movie,
every actor is just so damn good.</i>

437
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:34,385
So do you remember when I was teaching
you how to drive in the Wagoneer,

438
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:39,896
and you sideswiped that taxi
and knocked off his side mirror?

439
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:44,335
No, I have no recollection
of that whatsoever.

440
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:49,838
Well, well, well, I would like to share
with everyone that Miss Rachel,

441
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:53,672
before she had her license
or knew anything about how to drive,

442
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:58,806
managed to out-maneuver an irate,
screaming cab driver

443
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,442
all the way across 96th Street
to the East River,

444
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:05,750
handily avoiding two EMT guys
loading an old lady

445
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,916
onto a gurney or something.

446
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:13,987
<i>Watching this, it's almost as if...</i>

447
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:21,903
<i>It's just the Rachel-Kym relationship
is almost striking me as a great love story,</i>

448
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,598
<i>in that, you know, the way
you sort of track your lover in a room.</i>

449
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,268
<i>It's the way I...</i>

450
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:31,974
<i>God, I was just so plugged in to her at all
times, even in these big group scenes.</i>

451
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,610
<i>I'm always aware of where she is
and I think vice versa.</i>

452
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:39,587
<i>And it was just really interesting to be just
so plugged in to another actor</i>

453
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:45,891
<i>even if there's 60 other people in the room
and you're not speaking to each other.</i>

454
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:53,132
So here's to a woman who can

455
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:58,174
drive fast, pick up a paramedic,
make up foreign languages

456
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:02,975
and still get you home in one piece.
And, Sidney, you're a lucky bastard.

457
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,241
Hear, hear.

458
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:11,955
<i>There are moments in this where
I'm not sure that we were...</i>

459
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:16,823
<i>I don't even know if we were making a movie
anymore, I think we were just getting to</i>

460
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,152
<i>experience each other.</i>

461
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,323
<i>This was one of those moments
when Carol-Jean says,</i>

462
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,697
<i>"This is what it's like in Heaven. "</i>

463
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,066
<i>I mean we were all...</i>

464
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:33,667
<i>We're showing the laughing take but there
was one where we were all really choked up.</i>

465
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,474
<i>Maybe being able to work this way...</i>

466
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:45,279
<i>Here's to you, Sid. I love you to pieces.
You're the best brother anybody can ask for.</i>

467
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:50,760
<i>I love that this is not the movie where
the maid of honor gets 10 lines,</i>

468
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:54,487
<i>the second bridesmaid gets five
and the other ones don't speak.</i>

469
00:33:54,599 --> 00:34:01,129
<i>I love that this is a movie where everyone's
character gets fleshed out.</i>

470
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:05,399
I just... I'm so grateful

471
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:09,378
to be your bridesmaid
and be a part of this moment and...

472
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,315
Don't look at me like that.

473
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:21,356
<i>Kym's speech I think is, to me, one of
the most brilliant bits of acting in the film.</i>

474
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,525
<i>Hello.</i>

475
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,337
<i>It's so painful to watch.</i>

476
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,800
<i>Hello.</i>

477
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:42,012
<i>I'm Shiva the destroyer and your harbinger
of doom for this evening.</i>

478
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:46,049
<i>I would like to thank you all
for coming and welcome you.</i>

479
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:49,415
<i>Even though I haven't seen most of you
since my latest stretch in the big house.</i>

480
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,385
<i>But you all look fabulous.</i>

481
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,560
<i>So during the 20 minutes or so
that I was not in the hole for</i>

482
00:34:56,661 --> 00:35:00,791
<i>making a shiv out of my toothbrush,
I actually did participate</i>

483
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:03,196
<i>in the infamous 12-step program.</i>

484
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:11,569
<i>All the reactions on everyone's face,
I mean, there are no extras in this movie.</i>

485
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:18,306
<i>And everybody is really intimate with the
story and I think it makes all the difference.</i>

486
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:21,044
<i>There's no person sitting
in that room who hasn't</i>

487
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:27,316
<i>read the script and really knows
who they are to this family,</i>

488
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,892
<i>which you don't see in films often.</i>

489
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,464
<i>...is about making amends.</i>

490
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:43,602
<i>So, I did a lot of apologizing to people.</i>

491
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:49,040
<i>Some of whom barely remembered me,
most of whom barely remembered anything.</i>

492
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:53,106
<i>And I apologized for,</i>

493
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,883
<i>you know, like, bouncing a check,</i>

494
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:03,325
<i>or passing out in their bathtub
or flooding their</i>

495
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:09,065
<i>house and, you know,
just basically for involving them in</i>

496
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,625
<i>sordid activities that they were
desperately trying to forget. I</i>

497
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:19,440
<i>had to call this one girl who was, I think, 14,</i>

498
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,810
<i>but she couldn't come to the phone
actually because</i>

499
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,644
<i>her mom had taken out
a restraining order, but...</i>

500
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,746
<i>But anyway... So I spent a lot of time...
The point is, I spent a lot of time</i>

501
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:36,452
<i>apologizing to people who were
pretty much perfect strangers.</i>

502
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:40,998
<i>So, I would very much
like to take this opportunity</i>

503
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:46,764
<i>to not only congratulate
my extraordinary sister,</i>

504
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,637
<i>the future explorer in matters of the mind,
thank you very much,</i>

505
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:53,676
<i>and her adorable, impending husband</i>

506
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,542
<i>on the occasion
of their unprecedented nuptials,</i>

507
00:36:56,647 --> 00:37:02,142
<i>but also, to apologize
to said extraordinary sister,</i>

508
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:05,984
<i>future explorer in matters of the mind, for...</i>

509
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,755
<i>I just think that speech has so many layers.</i>

510
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:14,453
<i>Maybe Annie did three takes of it.</i>

511
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,591
<i>I just think it's really masterful
what she's doing.</i>

512
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,966
<i>I've been a nightmare, you've been a saint,</i>

513
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:26,169
<i>and I'm really just so damn glad
to be here with you</i>

514
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:29,872
<i>and Sidney's family
and our family and just...</i>

515
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,472
<i>Everyone's together and I'm just...</i>

516
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:37,988
<i>It's really great. So I am hereby</i>

517
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:43,186
<i>raising my seltzer to my laudatory sister</i>

518
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,888
<i>and herewith making amends.</i>

519
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:49,433
<i>Sidney, you are robbing
our dysfunctional family</i>

520
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:52,434
<i>of one of its most vital ingredients,</i>

521
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:55,505
<i>and its only member still willing to
lend me money.</i>

522
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,734
<i>- So, boo on you.
- That's not true.</i>

523
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:02,074
<i>Anyway, enjoy Hawaii.</i>

524
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,712
<i>- L'chaim.
- L'chaim.</i>

525
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,340
<i>One, two, one, two.</i>

526
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:13,788
<i>I think the whole aspect of the film that
our family was part of the music industry...</i>

527
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:19,294
<i>You know, that Paul is an executive
at a record company and Sidney is...</i>

528
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:25,961
<i>I think that that's something that
Jenny and Jonathan found later</i>

529
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:32,406
<i>as they workshopped the script together
and it's such a vital ingredient in the film.</i>

530
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,876
<i>It just gave us so many places to go.</i>

531
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:38,209
<i>Also, that the film can then be scored live</i>

532
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,444
<i>and that there will be musicians
floating around the house.</i>

533
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,787
<i>But then just an opportunity to put in</i>

534
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:51,361
<i>all these truly fabulous people
like Fab Five Freddy,</i>

535
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:56,689
<i>and that it would be possible
that they were hanging out in Jamaica</i>

536
00:38:56,801 --> 00:39:00,168
<i>and listening to music and signing bands</i>

537
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:04,298
<i>and I think it sort of blew open this whole</i>

538
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:09,807
<i>upper class, white Connecticut world</i>

539
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:13,213
<i>and just brought it into the larger world.</i>

540
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,340
I know.

541
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:21,354
<i>Sidney has always nurtured me
and supported me...</i>

542
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:24,826
<i>I think Paul really is drunk in this scene.</i>

543
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:28,261
<i>In lira, it's billions.</i>

544
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,637
<i>And I have no idea why
he's wearing those sunglasses.</i>

545
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,229
...and amazing stuff, and...

546
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,606
- This is not an award.
- I know, I'm not even using it.

547
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:44,747
<i>See like this, this should be the
train wreck moment at the rehearsal dinner.</i>

548
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,317
<i>But what's so genius is that
it already happened with Kym</i>

549
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,784
<i>and that's the only one that
we choose to remember and focus on.</i>

550
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,515
<i>Because she's still</i>

551
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:57,726
<i>constantly getting punished for something
that happened a long time ago.</i>

552
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:00,126
<i>We even did...</i>

553
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:04,858
<i>In one of the takes when Zafer,</i>

554
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:11,841
<i>here he sort of reprises Donald Harrison's
version of Rachel and Sidney,</i>

555
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:14,808
<i>which is so beautiful.</i>

556
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,647
<i>We did something where everyone
at the table sort of hummed it.</i>

557
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,741
<i>And there's a lot of things
that ended up not in the movie</i>

558
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:24,036
<i>but the residual is there and we got to do it.</i>

559
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:26,220
<i>But the residual is there and we got to do it.</i>

560
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,689
<i>So, it doesn't really matter
that it's not in the movie.</i>

561
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:31,660
Oh, God, I am exhausted.

562
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:35,058
- Is there any watermelon?
- Let me see.

563
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:39,769
<i>This is one of my favorite scenes
in that way of shooting,</i>

564
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:44,534
<i>that you can go into a dark room
and a camera will follow you.</i>

565
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:48,408
<i>And as an actor it's your obligation
to find the lights if you want to be seen.</i>

566
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:55,078
<i>And that we're not, you know,</i>

567
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,714
<i>building the scenes
around the way they were lit.</i>

568
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:03,817
<i>They're lighting and shooting around
what the actors are doing.</i>

in another direction. ' '

571
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,906
- Yes.
- But you've never said anything to me

572
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:18,634
that's remotely apologetic,

573
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:21,643
yet all of sudden at my wedding dinner
in front of everybody,

574
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:25,112
you decide to grace us all
with your development.

575
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:26,740
I just got home.

576
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:30,115
"Gee. Hey, everybody and guests,

577
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:33,019
"just in case you might be thinking
about something else for five minutes,

578
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:36,752
"like, I don't know, my sister's wedding,
they just cut me loose.

579
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:40,490
"I'm a loose cannon!
Anybody up for some rehab humor?

580
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:43,965
"Because I'm really, really fine
with acknowledging my disease.

581
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:48,698
"Hey, and now watch me be really selfless
and weave a lovely blanket apology

582
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,536
"to my sister for being
just a tad out of her loop. ' '

583
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:53,633
- You are so cynical.
- Rachel, enough.

584
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,006
Rachel, she is making an effort here.

585
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,603
An effort, is that what that was?
Because I think she presumes

586
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,740
that since everything has always
revolved around her disease,

587
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,751
that everything else is going to revolve
around her recovery. That's what I think.

588
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,787
- Rachel, she just got home.
- Again.

589
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:09,784
- I had no idea you were so angry, Doctor.
- I'm not.

590
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,384
Oh, my God.

591
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:15,731
Kymmie, your sister has got
a lot on her plate right now.

592
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:18,563
- She is uptight about...
- I'm not uptight, Dad!

593
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:24,038
<i>This is like a 12-page scene
and I think we wrapped at 2/00.</i>

594
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,439
<i>That's what working with Jonathan was like.</i>

595
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:30,571
<i>We did it a few times and he said,
"I think we've got it. "</i>

596
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:32,271
<i>I'm like, "Really?"</i>

597
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,643
Yeah, and that's why it would be so lovely
if we could all...

598
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:37,186
You know, you people really need to purge.

599
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,984
You really should go to a Nar-Anon
or something. It's...

600
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:44,527
Now, Kym, come on, baby. Oh, my Lord.
We've been to Nar-Anon. You know that.

601
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:49,327
Wait, wait a second. You people? You mean,
your family? The people in this room?

602
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:52,994
Yes. All of you people living in
this little world of judgment

603
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:57,563
and paranoia and mistrust.
I can feel it all the time. It's like...

604
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:03,272
At the slightest sign of ingratitude or

605
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:07,043
absence of atonement, it's like
the fucking Salem witch trials around here.

606
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,949
- I should just use again. I should.
- Don't even start that.

607
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:12,545
- Don't even start.
- Wait, wait, wait.

608
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,784
Kym. Kym, look at me.

609
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,821
Nobody can make you feel any kind of
way unless you let them. Period. The end.

610
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,959
Thank you, Carol,

611
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:27,697
but you people are my family.

612
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:29,796
I mean, you make me feel like shit
a hundred times a day.

613
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:33,172
You know what, Rach? You try living under
Dad's constant monitoring for five minutes,

614
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,711
- tell me how you like it.
- What constant monitoring?

615
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:38,805
- Kym?
- Oh, my God! Are you serious?

616
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:40,781
"Carol, Carol, where is she?"

617
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:43,682
"Don't sleep here, sleep here.
Eat this. You know, I'll drive you. ' '

618
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,220
Dad, really, honestly,
you're kind of obsessed.

619
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:46,812
Oh, my God. That's hardly news.

620
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:50,553
I mean, you may not know this, Kym.
No, sure you do.

621
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,596
I mean, the only way to engage Dad
in any meaningful communication

622
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:56,188
is to start the conversation with your name.

623
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,827
"Have you heard from Kym? How's Kym?"
It resuscitates him.

624
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:02,633
It jars him into the moment, like an alarm.

625
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,005
- Rachel, that is not true. It is totally unfair.
- What? She's even worse, Dad!

626
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,237
"Dad, you're never going to believe this,
but that check you sent me

627
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:10,279
"never showed up,
and my landlord hates me. ' '

628
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,906
"Dad, can somebody meet me downstairs
with cab fare?

629
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:16,544
"And you're never going to believe this but I
lost my wallet and my checkbook got stolen.

630
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,487
"I got to go to the emergency room,
and everybody hates me. ' '

631
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:23,321
<i>I also love the writing in these scenes
'cause everybody is right.</i>

632
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,394
<i>There is no bad guy
and there is no good guy.</i>

633
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,262
<i>Rachel is just as badly behaved as Kym is.</i>

634
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:34,667
<i>And I also love that they don't have to walk
through the same room</i>

635
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:40,334
<i>to get back to the kitchen because we're
shooting a movie where you can just live.</i>

636
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:44,810
...but God forbid I should even reference
the boundary thing,

637
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:46,678
even though I actually know
what I'm talking about.

638
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:50,845
By the way, I'm not in crisis.
I haven't been in crisis in a year.

639
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:53,855
- You just got out of rehab!
- Oh, my God!

640
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:57,449
Why is this so difficult
for you to understand?

641
00:44:57,561 --> 00:45:00,553
Rehabilitation, crisis.
You should really learn the difference.

642
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:03,690
No, it's like you're not happy unless
I'm in some kind of a desperate situation.

643
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:06,565
You have no idea what to do with me
unless I'm in crisis.

644
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,365
Why am I the only one
willing to say this shit?

645
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:11,270
You are so much more
evolved in your suffering.

646
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,865
I'm not... Who is talking about that?

647
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:14,773
Your suffering is not the most
important thing to everybody.

648
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,176
- Who is saying it is?
- I have a life. I'm in school.

649
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:19,647
- I'm getting married. I'm...
- What?

650
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,690
Pregnant.

651
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:31,119
<i>I love Bill Irwin in this scene.</i>

652
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,526
<i>It's funny that so many people
later said to me,</i>

653
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,762
<i>that, God, Rachel just has such a move
when she announces her pregnancy.</i>

654
00:45:35,797 --> 00:45:37,894
<i>That, God, Rachel just has such a move
when she announces her pregnancy.</i>

655
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:40,026
<i>And I thought it was
just such an honest thing to do.</i>

656
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:43,937
<i>I think once you inhabit these characters,
you become a lawyer for them</i>

657
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,703
<i>and you can justify all your behavior.</i>

658
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:52,043
<i>And watching it now, it does look like
a move there to take her sister down.</i>

659
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:55,277
<i>But at the time I thought
I really just wanted my family to know.</i>

660
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:59,149
Roughly about the day before
we decided to get married.

661
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,451
I can barely believe this myself!

662
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:03,617
How far? How along? You know?

663
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:07,219
I mean, how pregnant are you?
Did you tell your mother?

664
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,422
- Yeah. We told her at dinner.
- Good. Okay, good.

665
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,467
- She was so happy.
- Dad, stop. Can you just stop?

666
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,661
Please. Seriously. Fuck me!

667
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:19,339
Rachel, I'm sorry, Dad, but you can't drop
a tectonic bit of information

668
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,571
into a completely separate conversation,
Rachel. You can't do that.

669
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:26,612
- Kym, you're going to have a niece.
- Or nephew.

670
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:30,448
I know. Oh, God. Yeah, I'm excited for you.
But you can't

671
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:35,048
tell me when we're talking like this, Rach.
It's a total set-up. It's not fair.

672
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:39,220
Yeah.

673
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:45,367
God. I am so fucking exhausted.

674
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:49,064
Oh, God.
Dad, will you tell her I'm happy for her?

675
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:51,004
She won't talk to me.

676
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:54,901
I'm really tired.
I think I'm going to head up to bed. Sidney?

677
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:56,536
- Yeah. That's a great idea.
- You're leaving now,

678
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,205
- in the middle of this conversation?
- Yes.

679
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:02,081
Kymmie, she's pregnant
and she's exhausted, baby.

680
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:05,212
Okay. Okay, fine. Fair enough.

681
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,586
Thank you so much
for telling me about Hawaii.

682
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:09,352
- Congratulations, Sid.
- Thanks.

683
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:10,983
Rachel, I cannot tell you how happy I am.

684
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:13,858
Do you guys want anything?
Do you want a sandwich or anything?

685
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:18,697
You guys must be hungry.
You got aloo gobi, there's cold saagwala.

686
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:23,205
- I really am pretty sleepy, Dad.
- You really are pretty everything!

687
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:24,604
And you, too!

688
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:28,704
Holy cow. This has been one hell of a day.
I think...

689
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:30,541
If you don't mind, sweetie, I'm just going...

690
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,308
- No!
- I mean, my God.

691
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:35,579
- I'm just going to go to bed.
- I'll be right up, dear.

692
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,111
- I just want to load the dishwasher.
- Grandpa.

693
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:40,485
That's me.

694
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,029
Thanks for taking that.

695
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:51,496
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Night, night. Sweet dreams.

696
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:57,199
You know, I hope it was okay
that we told Mom at dinner about the baby.

697
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:02,677
<i>There's not a lot of
two-person scenes in this movie.</i>

698
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:08,851
<i>So you really get to earn
these moments between each other</i>

699
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:12,716
<i>when you get a quiet moment.</i>

700
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:14,916
<i>There were, I think, more in the script,</i>

701
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:17,892
<i>but then if you're gonna shoot it</i>

702
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:20,725
<i>like a home movie,
more like a documentary,</i>

703
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:27,464
<i>it's very rare that two people sit down in a
room together and solve all their problems.</i>

704
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:29,834
<i>It just sort of happens when
you're not looking.</i>

705
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:33,042
<i>And I think that's how the movie is shot.</i>

706
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:39,571
<i>Okay, here's the rain. It just rained a lot
while we were making this film.</i>

707
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:47,016
<i>And we just decided to use it. It was all in.
Anything happened, we put it in the movie.</i>

708
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,559
<i>This is one of my favorite scenes to shoot.</i>

709
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:53,857
<i>If I could just shoot a scene with
Debra Winger every day,</i>

710
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,955
<i>I'd be a happy woman.</i>

711
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:59,734
<i>And again, like most scenes,
we didn't rehearse.</i>

712
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:02,066
<i>I think Debra and I came up
early in the morning</i>

713
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:06,302
<i>before we had our hair and makeup done
and talked about our weekend.</i>

714
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:10,175
<i>And Jonathan turned the light on and
then said,</i>

715
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,306
<i>"Okay, you guys
can go back and get ready. "</i>

716
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:19,387
- Is your sister behaving herself?
- I'm not exactly sure what that means.

717
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:23,991
<i>As an actor you have to, sort of, forget that
you're working with Debra Winger,</i>

718
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:28,861
<i>otherwise you'd be too scared and nervous
'cause she's such a powerhouse.</i>

719
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:36,432
<i>And at this moment when I looked over my
shoulder at the rain and turned back</i>

720
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,804
<i>and she smiled at me,
I thought, "Oh, my God, it's Debra Winger. "</i>

721
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,709
<i>She is sort of so radiant,
it takes your breath away.</i>

722
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,584
<i>And it felt so easy to work with her.</i>

723
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:54,817
<i>There's no acting going on.</i>

724
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:02,061
<i>That when we wrapped it I wanted to do it
for seven or eight more hours.</i>

725
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,932
Thank you, sweetheart. No, I don't.

726
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:09,870
Can you see me? I'd be one of those

727
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:13,807
women, you know, like,
the insane wedding mother...

728
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:19,076
<i>And we truly didn't know what movie we
were making. I remember in this scene...</i>

729
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,343
<i>And we didn't use it</i>

730
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:27,754
<i>but Declan would sort of zoom in
on your hands or one of your eyes or...</i>

731
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,392
<i>And it was kind of liberating</i>

732
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:36,057
<i>because after a point you stopped
worrying about the camera at all.</i>

733
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,534
I hope it's a boy.

734
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:48,334
Just as long as it's healthy,
that's what you say.

735
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:52,507
- Hi, I'm Kym. I'm an addict.
- Hi, Kym.

736
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:54,516
I am nine months clean.

737
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:02,149
When I was 16,
I was babysitting my little brother.

738
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,958
And I was...

739
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:10,461
I had taken all these Percocet
and I was unbelievably high.

740
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:12,558
And I...

741
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:19,205
We'd driven over to the park on Lakeshore.

742
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:22,767
And he was in his red socks,

743
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:26,679
just running around in these piles of leaves.

744
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:29,752
And he would bury me,

745
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:33,755
and I would bury him in the leaves.

746
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:39,224
<i>There's a great bit
of storytelling as well in that.</i>

747
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:44,058
<i>Kym goes through this huge thing,</i>

748
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:49,036
<i>there's a huge step of telling this story,
I think, in her meeting.</i>

749
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,264
<i>She comes back to the house</i>

750
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:53,433
<i>and no one knows that
that's what she just went through.</i>

751
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:57,604
<i>And we're still being petty and sisterly</i>

752
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:59,978
<i>and trying to get through the wedding.</i>

753
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,644
<i>But the audience is privy to all of it.</i>

754
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:09,725
And

755
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,622
I lost control of the car

756
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:20,494
and drove off the bridge.

757
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,969
And the car went into the lake.

758
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,938
And I couldn't get him out of his car seat.

759
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,845
And he drowned.

760
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:42,017
And I struggle with God so much

761
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:46,359
because I can't forgive myself.

762
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:51,366
And I don't really want to right now.
I can live with it, but I can't forgive myself.

763
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:56,996
And sometimes, I don't want to believe
in a god that could forgive me.

764
00:52:57,107 --> 00:53:00,372
But I do want to be sober.

765
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:05,841
I'm alive and I'm present,
and there's nothing controlling me.

766
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:08,349
If I hurt someone, I hurt someone.

767
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:12,547
I can apologize
and they can forgive me or not.

768
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:15,716
But I can change.

769
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:21,856
And I just wanted to share that and say,

770
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:25,093
congratulations that God makes you
look up. I'm so happy for you.

771
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:29,400
But if he doesn't, come here.
That's all. Thank you.

772
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,135
Thanks for sharing.

773
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,203
Where's... Where's you, Emma?

774
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:37,473
- Emma, where's you?
- I'm right here.

775
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:41,278
- It's really raining.
- That's today.

776
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:44,348
- Done.
- It's going to be fine.

777
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:45,785
Okay.

778
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,254
<i>I don't' know whose idea that was.</i>

779
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,653
<i>That we'd have like Monopoly pieces
and ceramic figurines</i>

780
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:56,664
<i>represent all the guests at the wedding,
but it was a really fun scene.</i>

781
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,394
This is what you've got, Emma? So far?

782
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:04,130
I'm fine. That is kind of perfect.

783
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,175
There's six of each, right?

784
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:09,368
- Except for me.
- I'm the telephone.

785
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:12,846
Hey, Rachel! Check it out!

786
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,851
<i>It was very cold, this day. I remember.</i>

787
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:22,381
<i>It was October or November at this point.</i>

788
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:23,985
<i>And maybe with global warming</i>

789
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:29,498
<i>none of the leaves had started changing yet
or falling off the trees.</i>

790
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:35,371
<i>So we just had to keep shooting
more deeply into the fall.</i>

791
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:44,137
<i>God, it's amazing to me, 'cause when
I watch the film I think about Jonathan</i>

792
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:49,742
<i>and all the scenes and what he said,
and he said so little and just let us really go.</i>

793
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:53,016
<i>Because this is another scene I remember
him giving me some direction.</i>

794
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:57,958
<i>But most of the time his direction would
just consist of coming over</i>

795
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:01,360
<i>and whispering in my ear,
"Be you. Be you. Be you. "</i>

796
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:04,433
<i>And then he would drift back
into the scenery.</i>

797
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:09,902
<i>And this was another place where he
didn't want me to let Kym off the hook.</i>

798
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:15,808
<i>But I realized he so rarely had something
specific that he wanted you to hit.</i>

799
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:19,380
<i>He usually just watched
what the actors were doing</i>

800
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:24,044
<i>and then maybe gently nudged them
to go a little bit deeper.</i>

801
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:27,348
That would make it 13, though.
I think Rachel wanted to keep it to 12.

802
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:31,424
<i>I don't know. I felt like he directed
this movie without directing it at all.</i>

803
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:32,995
Where are you putting me?

804
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:37,155
I was going to put you with Cookie Puss
and the Chicago cousins

805
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:40,327
because they always get really drunk
and need wrangling.

806
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:43,565
Well, can someone else do it?
I was sort of planning on enjoying myself.

807
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:46,073
- You're the only one they're afraid of.
- No, this is easy.

808
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,270
We can put Grandma Rose
down here with her companion

809
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,779
at this other table,
which is actually a really good idea.

810
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:54,816
Great. That's all I need. Another reason
for Grandma Rose to hate me.

811
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:56,476
- She does not hate you.
- Are you kidding?

812
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:57,917
She's still mad about
the whole Rite Aid thing.

813
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,113
Nonsense!

814
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:03,682
Dad, can I show you something
in the kitchen?

815
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:15,160
<i>I guess my character's whole journey
can be summed up in this scene.</i>

816
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:17,569
<i>"Can I just have a fucking day?"</i>

817
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:20,234
- Eliza, would you excuse us for a moment?
- Yeah.

818
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:21,435
Thanks.

819
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,177
- Rachel, what is this behavior?
- Can I just have a day? Please?

820
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:29,683
Have all the days you want, darling.
Nobody is trying to take your day.

821
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:31,845
Then why are you defending her?

822
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:34,651
Defending her from what?
Rachel, nobody's defending anybody.

823
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:36,350
Why are you protecting her?

824
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:39,394
Because I don't want her to think
we don't want her.

825
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:43,694
Sometimes I don't want her.
It's my fucking wedding!

826
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:50,638
<i>This was one of those scenes where I think
there were five characters written into it,</i>

827
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:54,005
<i>and Jonathan said,
"Let's have everybody in this scene. "</i>

828
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:57,539
<i>So it started as this scene
from Jenny's script</i>

829
00:56:57,647 --> 00:57:01,947
<i>and it turned into something totally more.</i>

830
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:07,889
<i>Which was great because it was such
an important moment in this family</i>

831
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:12,620
<i>to come back in contact
with the loss of Ethan</i>

832
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:16,062
<i>because it's just
the ghost in the room all the time.</i>

833
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:22,730
<i>But it just became this great,</i>

834
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:26,197
<i>you know, dishwasher off.</i>

835
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:32,738
<i>And Jenny Lumet tells a great story about
how this is something that really happened</i>

836
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:36,751
<i>in her childhood between her dad,
Sidney Lumet, and Bob Fosse</i>

837
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:38,521
<i>that she witnessed.</i>

838
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:45,355
Painful. Painful, sweetie.

839
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,355
All right.

840
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:53,095
Oh, no!

841
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,532
What, are we timing it?

842
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,868
Yeah, let's work with time,
if you're going to do it right.

843
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,566
- Dad, what's the time limit?
- Go!

844
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:01,803
- How long do you want to time it?
- Two minutes.

845
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:03,538
Is that all right?
Are you all right with that, sir?

846
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:07,409
<i>And, of course, Bill Irwin
had to pull back in this scene</i>

847
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:10,145
<i>because his physical comedy
abilities are astonishing,</i>

848
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:13,484
<i>but he had to be Paul Buchman,
but when we finished the scene,</i>

849
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:18,994
<i>of course, he did a lot of plate juggling
with about ten plates at a time</i>

850
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:22,963
<i>and flipping them under his legs
and everything.</i>

851
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:28,036
<i>But, he couldn't the camera was rolling
'cause I don't think Paul has that skill set.</i>

852
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:32,434
It might be worth pointing out
that the dishes need to be rinsed.

853
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:35,537
- Are you shaking in your boots?
- You got 20 seconds.

854
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,338
Fifteen seconds left.

855
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,985
<i>So amazing that the movie scores itself</i>

856
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:50,321
<i>by having friends who are musicians
be around the house.</i>

857
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:02,468
You know, all you young people
who are applauding,

858
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,199
you should go fuck yourselves.

859
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,168
- Sweetie, keep it clean!
- No, I'm just saying.

860
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:11,076
- It's a wonderful attempt, Son.
- Okay. I tried to fix it.

861
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,341
Kieran, if you could clean out
that machine, I will then be able

862
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:16,850
to break out the whoop-ass
on this young man here.

863
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:19,812
He's breaking out the whoop-ass!

864
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:22,551
- Let's break out the whoop-ass.
- Break out the whoop-ass.

865
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:24,627
When that machine is empty,
I will show you how it's done.

866
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:29,994
<i>Something else I love about
these group scenes is that it</i>

867
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:36,436
<i>gives the characters of Kym and Rachel an
opportunity to be together without words.</i>

868
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:40,372
<i>Like you realize what it was like growing up
and even when...</i>

869
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:44,346
<i>I don't even know if they looked
at each other once in this scene</i>

870
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:47,143
<i>when they're sitting right next to each other.</i>

871
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,617
But that's all right.
I'm ready any time you say "go. ' '

872
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,209
Go!

873
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:59,589
<i>Bill Irwin is good at loading the dishwasher.</i>

874
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,591
<i>He must've done a lot of research.</i>

875
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:05,061
Go, Dad!

876
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:07,332
Here, Son. Have some.

877
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:11,237
Cup handles!

878
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:17,402
<i>It's a side load. I love this scene 'cause
every time I watch it I hear something new.</i>

879
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:18,878
He's good.

880
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,382
Buchman, in front of your family.

881
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:30,721
Buchman, your women will weep.

882
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:33,327
Last one!

883
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:38,859
- Could I have my time, please?
- You have 15 seconds left.

884
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:46,398
<i>We trusted Jonathan so much because
these scenes all you knew, a scene like this,</i>

885
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:50,068
<i>was that you had to reveal the plate
and stack the dishwasher.</i>

886
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:54,912
<i>And anything that happened in between
just happened.</i>

887
01:00:55,218 --> 01:01:00,383
<i>But you really had to trust each other
and trust that Jonathan knew</i>

888
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:04,259
<i>that the moment the dish came out
Declan would find it.</i>

889
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:10,990
<i>Because other than that
there was just no roadmap.</i>

890
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:15,104
<i>Such a great way to fly, without a safety net.</i>

891
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:24,874
Let's grab some lemonade on the porch.

892
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:30,345
Is everything okay?

893
01:01:57,146 --> 01:02:00,115
<i>And I love that she just
puts one plate on top.</i>

894
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:20,400
<i>There was a scene in the car here
that we cut out</i>

895
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:27,236
<i>where we talked about Kym,
that she wanted to light a candle for Ethan.</i>

896
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,408
<i>And I thought it was inappropriate.</i>

897
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:31,104
<i>She does light a candle for Ethan at the end,</i>

898
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:36,208
<i>but I like that we never say what it is
and the audience has to figure it out.</i>

899
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:42,288
<i>We've also had some screaming matches,
she and I up to this point.</i>

900
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:46,259
<i>And I remember the scene
after we get our hair done</i>

901
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:51,466
<i>was written with a lot of capital letters
and a lot of exclamation points.</i>

902
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:57,028
<i>And I remember Jonathan... I said,
"Jonathan, I don't know.</i>

903
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:00,473
<i>"I've been screaming at her so much. I just...</i>

904
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:04,034
<i>"I don't know if the audience can bear it,
or if we can bear it. "</i>

905
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:06,513
<i>He said, "So don't yell, be soft. "</i>

906
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:10,141
<i>And I loved that we didn't even try
the yelling version.</i>

907
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:14,389
Oh, my God.

908
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:16,418
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

909
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:20,753
God is punishing me.

910
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:24,390
No, no, he's blessing me.

911
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:27,164
Well. Wow.

912
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:31,471
- So, how are you?
- I'm great. I'm great.

913
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:34,099
You remember?
We were in the hospital together, right?

914
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:36,735
We were... Were you at Milestones?

915
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:40,043
No. I didn't go to Milestones.
I didn't have the coverage.

916
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:42,845
We were on the same floor at Loeb House.

917
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:44,478
Okay.

918
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:48,780
- You look great.
- Twenty-eight months, clean and sober.

919
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,922
Praise God.

920
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:55,059
<i>God, Kym is really caught here.</i>

921
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:58,796
I can't believe that I'm seeing you again.

922
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:04,032
I know. It's so weird.

923
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,374
Listen.

924
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:11,469
Do you remember that exercise...

925
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:15,215
<i>Funny thing is, I actually couldn't
hear this conversation going on.</i>

926
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:18,947
<i>I was supposed to be having
such a strong reaction</i>

927
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:24,821
<i>to what he was telling her
and what she had said in rehab.</i>

928
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:28,292
<i>And they were just playing a really intimate
scene and I just actually couldn't hear it.</i>

929
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:34,268
<i>That's one of those movie magic moments
where it looks as though we can.</i>

930
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:37,230
You

931
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,765
were so brave.

932
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:44,008
The way your uncle abused
you and your sister

933
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:47,139
and how it led to your sister's anorexia.

934
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:51,118
And how you stayed up nights with her
when she was down to 50 pounds.

935
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,313
I will never forget reading that,

936
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:55,481
- I swear to God.
- Yeah.

937
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:59,493
I never, ever, thought I would have
the chance to thank you.

938
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:03,531
It was your strength

939
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:07,493
that gave me the courage

940
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:13,101
to confront my own abuse
and help turn my life around.

941
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:19,473
<i>Yeah, this is a scene that I love
that Jonathan let us just to do it quietly.</i>

942
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:22,244
Sorry, I just need a second. Rachel?

943
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:23,914
Rachel?

944
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,113
Rachel, what are you doing?

945
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:28,889
Where... Where are you going?

946
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,218
Rachel!

947
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:34,289
You know, I never had anorexia.

948
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:38,766
And you certainly didn't watch over me
while I was sleeping.

949
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:40,859
And we don't have a

950
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:45,134
goddamned pedophile uncle
who made our childhood a living hell

951
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:48,438
and explains away all your shit
in one fell swoop.

952
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:52,071
Did you tell them that Dad forced us
into a life of prostitution as well?

953
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:54,945
I wasn't hurting... No one got hurt, Rach.

954
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,583
- I'm hurt.
- Where are you going?

955
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:01,953
Rachel, open the door. Rachel!

956
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,588
<i>This next scene was probably my favorite...</i>

957
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:14,193
<i>Well, one of my favorite scenes
to shoot in the movie.</i>

958
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:20,039
<i>I love the writing. It was the first thing
that hooked me when I read the script.</i>

959
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:25,072
<i>And it was sort of impossible...</i>

960
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:27,509
Dad, don't tell me what I don't hate.

961
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:34,054
<i>...not to be full when
you're saying these words.</i>

962
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:38,454
<i>We shot pretty much in sequence
so by the time we got to this scene,</i>

963
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:41,553
<i>a lot of stuff had accumulated.</i>

964
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,967
- Where am I now, Dad?
- Thank God.

965
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:48,867
<i>And I love that it's a civilized
sit down conversation.</i>

966
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:52,406
<i>Because these people
love each other so much</i>

967
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:56,976
<i>and they're so desperately trying
to figure out how to forgive</i>

968
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:59,238
<i>and love each other better.</i>

969
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:05,676
<i>And that was funny, too.
Because Jonathan had them playing,</i>

970
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:08,052
<i>because they were always playing.
And we kept saying,</i>

971
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:12,184
<i>"God, are they gonna play during
this scene. This is sort of an intense scene. "</i>

972
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:15,957
<i>And, "It's kind of loud,
and this scene needs to be quiet. "</i>

973
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:21,529
<i>And Anne sort of asked one of the PAs
if they could run back and tell Jonathan</i>

974
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:25,095
<i>or the second AD that, "Can you ask
Jonathan to have them stop playing?"</i>

975
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:29,234
<i>And he said, "Well if you want them to stop
playing you'll have to ask them yourself. "</i>

976
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:32,007
<i>And then Anne yells out,
"Are they going to play all weekend?"</i>

977
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:33,741
Do you have any idea

978
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:38,415
how lonely it was here with everybody gone

979
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:40,650
into your

980
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:46,159
terrible little world?
I mean, there was nothing left.

981
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:49,095
Everybody was just empty.

982
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,131
You think that they

983
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:59,397
knew I was alive
or needed anything during your

984
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:01,767
life?

985
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:05,938
And after all that, the fights, the screaming,

986
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:09,142
the blaming, the loneliness...

987
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:15,014
<i>It's so hard to watch
this scene for me, because...</i>

988
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:18,355
<i>For a couple of reasons, one,
the intimacy between parents and children</i>

989
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:21,953
<i>and how hard it is grieve together,
sort of slays me.</i>

990
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:28,230
<i>And then also,
I had to draw a line in the sand with Kym.</i>

991
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:33,301
<i>And I couldn't really take her in and when I
watched the movie for the first time,</i>

992
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:39,079
<i>I really felt for her character in a way
that I couldn't allow myself as her sister.</i>

993
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:41,811
- What?
- God.

994
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:48,653
<i>I looked over after
one of the takes in this scene</i>

995
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:52,659
<i>and Declan, like I said,
who is really another character in our film,</i>

996
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:56,821
<i>he was crying with us. Like, I think
the eye piece was getting fogged up</i>

997
01:08:56,932 --> 01:09:01,631
<i>and he had to wipe his eyes 'cause
he really was one of the family members</i>

998
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:03,204
<i>going through this with us.</i>

999
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:07,299
I wanted her to get better or just die.

1000
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:09,934
- Rachel, she's better.
- And... No, no.

1001
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:13,173
Recovery doesn't work if you lie.
She knows that.

1002
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:15,812
I am worthless to her.

1003
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:20,321
- She doesn't give a shit about the rest of us!
- You are not worthless. How dare you!

1004
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:22,081
You're my sister.

1005
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:30,593
I love you guys.
I need you guys, but you don't

1006
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:35,200
get to sit around
for the rest of my life deciding

1007
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:38,296
what I'm supposed to be like.
I mean, you weren't there.

1008
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:41,706
You weren't inside of my head
when I was fucked-up.

1009
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:44,404
<i>I don't know what Anne
would say about this scene</i>

1010
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:49,177
<i>but I feel like the writing is so good,
it was one of the easiest scenes to shoot</i>

1011
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:52,186
<i>because we just had to say the words.</i>

1012
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:55,655
Okay. You were high for his life.
You were not present.

1013
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:58,124
- Okay. You were high.
- Yes.

1014
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:02,058
And you drove him off a bridge.
And now he's dead.

1015
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:04,655
- Rachel, it was an accident.
- Yes, I was.

1016
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:07,565
<i>And poor Paul Buchman
who has to sit and...</i>

1017
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:11,431
<i>That he can't leave the room for this.
It's just heartbreaking.</i>

1018
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:14,666
Who do I have to be now?

1019
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:20,743
I could be Mother Teresa.
It wouldn't make a difference what I did.

1020
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:25,653
Did I sacrifice every bit of

1021
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:29,155
love in this life because
I killed our little brother?

1022
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:33,592
- It was an accident. It was an accident.
- And I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1023
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:36,324
- Kymmie, Kymmie, it was an accident.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1024
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:44,637
<i>And I don't think Rachel can stay
with her dad in that moment.</i>

1025
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:50,042
<i>That's the thing about the grief
of this family, is they can't do it together.</i>

1026
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:56,410
<i>And, obviously, Abby can't do it with them
either. It was just too big of a loss.</i>

1027
01:10:57,386 --> 01:11:01,288
<i>And to have that sort of weave through
the whole movie</i>

1028
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:04,985
<i>and through the joy of pregnancy</i>

1029
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:07,895
<i>and a marriage is just...</i>

1030
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,691
<i>I think what, to me, is so beautiful about
the movie</i>

1031
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:13,764
<i>is trying to overcome
that obstacle, and they do.</i>

1032
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:15,369
<i>At times, baby steps.</i>

1033
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:25,372
<i>I like that we don't all go into alarmist mode
when she's gone</i>

1034
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:28,882
<i>because you really see
that this has been the pattern.</i>

1035
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:33,088
<i>You know, it's not like
everybody's calling 911.</i>

1036
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:36,055
<i>They've been down this road
a million times.</i>

1037
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:41,328
<i>And I think you can feel
the weight of it in this scene.</i>

1038
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:45,594
I mean, when I...
When I got out, I didn't see them for years.

1039
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:50,468
And it just really takes time, and I... And...

1040
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,400
If you're not ready to take
responsibility for something,

1041
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:56,569
people make something up,
which is probably what happened, but...

1042
01:11:56,679 --> 01:12:00,410
I mean, you know,
honestly, Rachel, that happened like...

1043
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:01,608
It was a couple of years ago...

1044
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:03,742
Paul, do you want me to go out
and look for her?

1045
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:04,944
No.

1046
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:09,713
You can't. I mean, you have
a wedding tomorrow. A hundred people...

1047
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:12,726
I'll go. I mean, you know... It's fine. I'll go.

1048
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:14,591
- Where are you going to go?
- I can take a look for her.

1049
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:17,427
Do you guys know where she might be, or...

1050
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:29,839
<i>I love that this is the caterer.</i>

1051
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,343
I'm sorry?

1052
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:37,282
<i>Anna Deavere Smith does some
great listening right there.</i>

1053
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:44,455
<i>And I love the relationship
between Kieran and Kym, too.</i>

1054
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:48,386
<i>They definitely are not meant to be...
They shouldn't be having sex</i>

1055
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:53,127
<i>if they're both in the program,
but then it really leads to</i>

1056
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:58,603
<i>this complicated, messy relationship
which is so important to the film.</i>

1057
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:00,902
I need a glass of water.

1058
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:04,012
<i>And this is one of the craziest scenes
in the movie.</i>

1059
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:06,479
<i>It's like Greek tragedy.</i>

1060
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,280
Is Andrew going to be home soon?

1061
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:16,187
Yes. He just went to a dinner. Not late.

1062
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:21,423
Did something happen
with you and Rachel?

1063
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:25,461
Is everything all right with the wedding?

1064
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:26,898
- Yeah.
- Good.

1065
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:34,936
Why did you leave me in charge of him?

1066
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:41,249
You knew. All of you knew.

1067
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:43,215
- Kym.
- People told you.

1068
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:48,252
I was a junkie. I was a crazy drug addict.

1069
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,955
- I stole from you.
- Yes.

1070
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:54,995
I lied to your face.

1071
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,793
I weighed six pounds.
My hair was falling out.

1072
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:01,666
- I spent every dinner in the bathroom.
- Honey, you were sick.

1073
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,398
- That was an illness.
- You know what I was.

1074
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:09,406
I stayed in my room for days.
I passed out all the time.

1075
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:10,978
No, no.

1076
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:13,172
- What were you thinking?
- No.

1077
01:14:13,849 --> 01:14:15,111
Why did you leave me?

1078
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:20,544
<i>The way that Debra Winger says
the word "sweetheart" in this scene,</i>

1079
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:22,920
<i>I've just never heard anything like that.</i>

1080
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:30,691
<i>It's just ten years of pain.</i>

1081
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:32,767
No! You were good with him!

1082
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:35,496
- You were the best you were with him!
- Listen to me! Listen!

1083
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:38,596
I didn't expect you to kill him, sweetheart!

1084
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:40,299
- You were not supposed to kill him!
- Mom!

1085
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:42,468
Mom! What are you doing? Get off!

1086
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:44,944
- Oh, God! God!
- Mom!

1087
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:52,953
<i>I love that Anne gets to hit her back.
I thought this was just a brutal scene.</i>

1088
01:14:53,355 --> 01:14:54,980
<i>They're so fierce.</i>

1089
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:17,005
<i>This I think in the script
originally it was that "Kym hits a deer. "</i>

1090
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:21,013
<i>And I kind of love that they changed it,</i>

1091
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:24,950
<i>and that she's just at this point in her life
can't go right, and she can't go left.</i>

1092
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:28,489
<i>There's no other way that she can go,</i>

1093
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:32,117
<i>so she just crashes.</i>

1094
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:38,923
<i>There's nowhere for this girl to go.</i>

1095
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:09,186
<i>We also shot a scene
that didn't stay in the movie,</i>

1096
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:16,067
<i>where Emma and Rachel spooned in bed
waiting for Kym to come home.</i>

1097
01:16:16,638 --> 01:16:19,664
<i>And we didn't need it.</i>

1098
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:24,140
<i>But like so many things,
we had the experience of doing it.</i>

1099
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:28,773
<i>And if you just hold another actor
for three hours and shoot a scene,</i>

1100
01:16:28,984 --> 01:16:31,350
<i>you're going to become
good friends with them.</i>

1101
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:33,818
<i>So when you're shooting the wedding,</i>

1102
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:38,484
<i>you know that this person really is
your maid of honor, your best gal.</i>

1103
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:12,048
Are you okay, miss?

1104
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:54,031
Right over here. It's a mess.

1105
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:00,801
It's Kym. I'm fine.

1106
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:02,243
I...

1107
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:09,581
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem.

1108
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:19,917
<i>This scene when she comes back
originally had dialog in it.</i>

1109
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:26,467
<i>And maybe it was almost a little funny.
And they took it out.</i>

1110
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:30,129
<i>And I think it was a smart choice</i>

1111
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:35,642
<i>because the big sister thing to do
when your baby sister comes home</i>

1112
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:39,737
<i>and is all broken and battered
is to take her and give her a bath.</i>

1113
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:42,377
<i>This was another one
of my favorite scenes to shoot.</i>

1114
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:45,282
<i>Anne was so...</i>

1115
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:49,914
<i>Oh, God,
she was just so raw and vulnerable in it.</i>

1116
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:54,188
- Kymmie, are... Oh, God. Are you all right?
- Yeah. I just need to go.

1117
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:55,263
No, we've got to get to the hospital.

1118
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:56,352
No, Dad. I need to get dressed.

1119
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:00,327
<i>And again you feel like they've
been here so many times before,</i>

1120
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:04,064
<i>but this is one of those baby steps
towards forgiveness</i>

1121
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:07,539
<i>where I think everything just falls away.</i>

1122
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:11,874
<i>And we did some improvs
in the bathtub, too,</i>

1123
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:15,648
<i>where we had some stories</i>

1124
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:21,515
<i>and jokes and cried together.</i>

1125
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:25,889
<i>But, in the end, I think
that the silence is best.</i>

1126
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:37,329
<i>And this is the first time we see
that Kym has an "Ethan" tattoo on her back.</i>

1127
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:48,949
<i>And Rachel's got grandma's ring
and it's all interwoven.</i>

1128
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:01,228
- Fuck. I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

1129
01:20:01,329 --> 01:20:03,058
Goes in, like, 12 directions.

1130
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:12,396
I'm so happy you're home.

1131
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:21,346
<i>There's some CGI... You know,
computer mocked-up pictures</i>

1132
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:24,484
<i>of putting Annie and I together, from when
she was a little girl and I was a little girl.</i>

1133
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:27,519
<i>Of putting Annie and I together, from when
she was a little girl and I was a little girl.</i>

1134
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,254
<i>We looked like midgets.</i>

1135
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:39,496
<i>Again, like the rehearsal dinner, we just did
maybe three takes of the ceremony.</i>

1136
01:20:40,368 --> 01:20:44,600
<i>So, it had that feeling of just really living it.
I think it was raining.</i>

1137
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:48,506
<i>I don't know how it looks sunny there, but
I think it was raining outside at that point.</i>

1138
01:20:58,053 --> 01:21:02,080
<i>I love this little boy
at the entrance here with Olive.</i>

1139
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:11,956
<i>And a few days before we shot this scene
Jonathan said that, "You know, it's scripted</i>

1140
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:15,730
<i>"that we hear what Sidney says
and then he sings her a song.</i>

1141
01:21:16,104 --> 01:21:19,335
<i>"And I think it would be really cool
to hear Rachel's side of things. "</i>

1142
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:22,308
<i>And then I was sort of like,
"Are you kidding me? People take months</i>

1143
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:26,506
<i>"or a year to write their wedding vows. "
And I had a day to come up with it.</i>

1144
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:31,917
<i>But it was so great to sort of regroup
and figure out where this woman was</i>

1145
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:34,716
<i>at this point in her life.</i>

1146
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:38,190
<i>And say what I really
wanted to say to this man.</i>

1147
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:50,432
<i>This is the first time that
Abby and Kym see each other.</i>

1148
01:21:50,538 --> 01:21:55,339
<i>From this point on Rachel and Kym are
aligned in a way that they haven't been.</i>

1149
01:21:57,946 --> 01:22:02,883
<i>- Rachel, Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
- Sidney, Sidney, Sidney, Sidney</i>

1150
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:10,649
<i>And of course I was nervous.
It was like that bridal fear of public speaking</i>

1151
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:15,093
<i>and it was all right there
and there's no acting here.</i>

1152
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:31,811
<i>There's Jenny Lumet in the back right there.</i>

1153
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:32,937
...and in joining themselves together
in holy wedlock.

1154
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:38,518
The weather's been pretty miserable
all weekend, but now it's a beautiful day.

1155
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:41,953
And it's a beautiful day because
when two people come together

1156
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:46,050
who really love one another
and want to share that with other people,

1157
01:22:46,161 --> 01:22:48,254
it makes it a beautiful day.

1158
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:54,232
So Sidney Williams and Rachel Buchman
have come do to that.

1159
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:56,304
And, Rachel, you go first.

1160
01:22:58,206 --> 01:23:00,800
Paul Buchman likes to say

1161
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:05,709
that the measure of a great life is

1162
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:08,476
not how well loved you are,

1163
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:11,484
but how well you love others.

1164
01:23:14,589 --> 01:23:17,057
Sidney, you teach me that every day.

1165
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,790
You are just so full of grace,

1166
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:27,563
and I promise before God
and these beautiful people

1167
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:31,300
that I will love you fiercely

1168
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,730
and sweetly.

1169
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:39,613
And I look forward to sharing
that great life with you.

1170
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:42,310
Thank you for marrying me.

1171
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:52,150
<i>This is another one of my favorite scenes
in the movie.</i>

1172
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:54,054
<i>It was...</i>

1173
01:23:55,497 --> 01:24:02,300
<i>The easiest part to play was
when he sang to me.</i>

1174
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:10,541
<i>I was just utterly swept away by the purity...</i>

1175
01:24:10,645 --> 01:24:11,612
You're welcome.

1176
01:24:13,415 --> 01:24:14,382
<i>...of that moment.</i>

1177
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:20,252
<i>That he could stand there in front of those
people with no music and just sing that.</i>

1178
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:30,228
<i>I used to order just to watch her
float across the floor</i>

1179
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:35,526
<i>She grew up in a small town</i>

1180
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:40,431
<i>Never put her roots down</i>

1181
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:46,003
<i>Daddy always kept moving, so she did, too</i>

1182
01:24:48,616 --> 01:24:51,380
<i>You know it ain't easy</i>

1183
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:55,614
<i>You got to hold on</i>

1184
01:24:56,624 --> 01:25:01,459
<i>She was an unknown legend in her time</i>

1185
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:07,001
<i>Now she's dressing two kids</i>

1186
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:11,630
<i>Looking for a magic kiss</i>

1187
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:16,942
<i>She gets the faraway look in her eyes</i>

1188
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:23,142
<i>Somewhere on a desert highway</i>

1189
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:28,016
<i>She rides a Harley-Davidson</i>

1190
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:33,587
<i>Her long brown hair flying in the wind</i>

1191
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:39,066
<i>She's been running half her life</i>

1192
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:45,036
<i>The chrome and steel she rides
colliding with</i>

1193
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:48,598
<i>The very air she breathes</i>

1194
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:52,708
<i>The air she breathes</i>

1195
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:58,315
Do we have some rings?

1196
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:17,768
Sidney, you go first
and place the ring on Rachel's hand.

1197
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:21,402
Do you?

1198
01:26:22,143 --> 01:26:23,474
Yeah, I do.

1199
01:26:26,147 --> 01:26:27,910
Sidney does. Do you, Rachel?

1200
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:35,983
<i>I love the expectant looks on
all the guests' faces.</i>

1201
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:40,550
By the power vested in me by
the state of Connecticut and by Neil Young,

1202
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:46,395
I pronounce that they are husband and wife,
and now you can kiss him.

1203
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:02,605
<i>And then we just go on
and have the best wedding ever.</i>

1204
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:08,754
<i>I mean, who gets Robyn Hitchcock and
Sister Carol East to play at their wedding.</i>

1205
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:15,754
<i>I love this not-scripted moment where
Abby and Paul run into each other.</i>

1206
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:18,123
<i>And have to hug each other.</i>

1207
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:32,478
<i>And I think Jonathan had been to a wedding
where the bride and groom fed everybody,</i>

1208
01:27:32,647 --> 01:27:39,075
<i>and so, they had these "Rachel and Sidney"
aprons made and we served our guests.</i>

1209
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:43,155
<i>And of course, all the actors really
got to chow down.</i>

1210
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:45,415
<i>We just had a wedding.</i>

1211
01:28:54,762 --> 01:28:56,457
Okay. We're going to cut the cake.

1212
01:28:57,198 --> 01:28:58,165
<i>That cake...</i>

1213
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:03,871
<i>You know, I was supposed to put my finger
in it and smear it and give him a bite.</i>

1214
01:29:03,971 --> 01:29:08,271
<i>It was as hard as a rock. Really something.</i>

1215
01:29:14,415 --> 01:29:16,815
Can we all do this together?

1216
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:22,787
Everybody.

1217
01:29:23,925 --> 01:29:25,392
Kym?

1218
01:29:25,493 --> 01:29:27,085
Wait. Where's... Where's Kym?

1219
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:28,423
I'm here.

1220
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:30,490
Mom?

1221
01:29:31,599 --> 01:29:33,499
- Dear God...
- Wait, wait, wait. Mom.

1222
01:29:33,601 --> 01:29:36,570
Okay, look at the camera. One, two, three.

1223
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:39,506
That's great. Thank you.

1224
01:29:40,341 --> 01:29:44,277
Dear God, please bless this family and
let them always invite us over for dinner,

1225
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:47,405
because God knows
my new wife cannot boil water or fry an egg.

1226
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:05,188
<i>I love that they just bust out the good music
right here in the afternoon.</i>

1227
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:07,460
<i>They don't even wait to go to the tent.</i>

1228
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:15,440
<i>I was singing this song for like
six months after we wrapped the movie.</i>

1229
01:30:23,484 --> 01:30:27,250
<i>There was a take where Anne and I
tried to dance with each other to this song,</i>

1230
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:30,652
<i>and we like smashed our knees
into each other.</i>

1231
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:33,818
<i>And we were like, "God, these two sisters
can't do anything right together. "</i>

1232
01:30:39,734 --> 01:30:42,100
<i>And Abby just can't participate.</i>

1233
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:50,472
<i>In this scene and in the scene in the tent,
I just love to watch how Kym dances</i>

1234
01:30:50,578 --> 01:30:52,011
<i>and how she...</i>

1235
01:30:53,481 --> 01:30:55,073
<i>Sort of, how internal it is.</i>

1236
01:31:28,616 --> 01:31:31,016
<i>There's Jonathan's daughter Jo Jo.</i>

1237
01:31:36,991 --> 01:31:41,291
<i>And now a word from our sponsor.</i>

1238
01:31:42,597 --> 01:31:44,997
<i>Mr. Buchman, if you please!</i>

1239
01:31:47,735 --> 01:31:52,331
<i>I'm getting now to the Williams family.
It's a done deal. We're relatives.</i>

1240
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:56,934
<i>We were fortunate that they could be
joined by Specialist Joseph Gonzales.</i>

1241
01:31:57,044 --> 01:32:00,980
<i>Son, we want you home and we want you
to put that damn camera down.</i>

1242
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:08,380
<i>I remember feeling like this was the moment,
you know, Emma and Rachel had planned</i>

1243
01:32:08,489 --> 01:32:12,619
<i>the surprise for Sidney,
these Brazilian dancers,</i>

1244
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:14,886
<i>as part of his wedding present,
and that this was the moment</i>

1245
01:32:14,996 --> 01:32:18,955
<i>that all the stress would melt away,
you know, all the wedding planning.</i>

1246
01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:22,092
<i>And Rachel and Sidney
would just let themselves go</i>

1247
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:24,398
<i>and dance themselves into a frenzy.</i>

1248
01:32:24,505 --> 01:32:28,339
<i>And in reality it was really cold,
the night we were shooting, and wet.</i>

1249
01:32:28,509 --> 01:32:29,806
<i>And it just didn't happen.</i>

1250
01:32:29,911 --> 01:32:34,905
<i>I mean, we had a blast
but that release that I was looking for</i>

1251
01:32:35,349 --> 01:32:38,011
<i>just didn't happen, that surrender.</i>

1252
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:40,679
<i>And it did come, but it came
in the last scene of the movie.</i>

1253
01:32:40,788 --> 01:32:43,120
<i>Which I guess was the right place for it.</i>

1254
01:32:44,125 --> 01:32:47,617
<i>But I remember the actor in me
wanted it here</i>

1255
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:50,822
<i>and intellectually thought
that this is where it was gonna come.</i>

1256
01:32:50,998 --> 01:32:57,198
<i>And it just... I still felt like the crazy,
control-freak bride, just having a good time.</i>

1257
01:33:25,566 --> 01:33:27,966
<i>It's so much fun to watch people dance.</i>

1258
01:33:53,761 --> 01:33:56,889
<i>And I just love how in her own world
Kym is here.</i>

1259
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:03,529
<i>Just seeing... You could
see in this sequence all the struggle in her,</i>

1260
01:34:06,674 --> 01:34:08,141
<i>the fight.</i>

1261
01:34:16,384 --> 01:34:19,182
<i>I think Jonathan met that woman
in the subway in New York City,</i>

1262
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:21,345
<i>the one with the fur hat.</i>

1263
01:34:21,455 --> 01:34:23,582
<i>And just went up and said,
"Would you be in our movie?"</i>

1264
01:34:42,476 --> 01:34:48,176
<i>That's what the whole movie feels like,
this is like a big jam session.</i>

1265
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:51,984
<i>You know, at this point all the musicians
in the film get to play together</i>

1266
01:34:52,086 --> 01:34:55,021
<i>and that's sort of like what
we were all doing all the time.</i>

1267
01:35:15,242 --> 01:35:17,506
<i>And this is where</i>

1268
01:35:17,611 --> 01:35:22,275
<i>Kym, sort of, goes out
and lights the candle in Ethan's memory.</i>

1269
01:35:22,416 --> 01:35:26,011
<i>Which the audience doesn't really know
or maybe they, sort of, do get it.</i>

1270
01:35:26,153 --> 01:35:28,280
<i>It's never named.
But I love that about the film,</i>

1271
01:35:28,422 --> 01:35:31,755
<i>that a lot of things are not
named or explained away.</i>

1272
01:35:35,629 --> 01:35:39,827
<i>God, Kyrah's got some moves. It looks like
it's in slow motion or something.</i>

1273
01:36:10,498 --> 01:36:13,934
<i>That was a lasso maneuver from
my college days I had to work in there.</i>

1274
01:36:14,068 --> 01:36:16,798
<i>Just to make my friends watching laugh.</i>

1275
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:03,577
Hey.

1276
01:38:04,511 --> 01:38:05,535
- Hey.
- Sorry.

1277
01:38:05,646 --> 01:38:07,045
No. Come in.

1278
01:38:08,182 --> 01:38:09,410
Come on.

1279
01:38:12,086 --> 01:38:13,781
Have you seen Mom?

1280
01:38:14,788 --> 01:38:17,723
No, she's probably taking a break.

1281
01:38:17,825 --> 01:38:21,352
How do you take a break from your own
daughter's wedding?

1282
01:38:22,096 --> 01:38:25,554
You know Mom. She doesn't really...

1283
01:38:28,636 --> 01:38:30,934
Oh, yeah. Here's the party.

1284
01:38:35,042 --> 01:38:37,704
Okay, this is too cute for me.

1285
01:38:37,811 --> 01:38:39,244
- Hello?
- Hello?

1286
01:38:39,346 --> 01:38:43,407
Rachel. Well, here you all are.
I've been looking all over for you.

1287
01:38:43,517 --> 01:38:44,575
Hey.

1288
01:38:46,153 --> 01:38:48,212
So lovely. I'm truly...

1289
01:38:48,389 --> 01:38:51,119
<i>This is another one of my favorite scenes.</i>

1290
01:38:52,693 --> 01:38:58,029
<i>Because I think these two girls
just need their mom so much.</i>

1291
01:38:58,132 --> 01:39:01,863
<i>And they're gonna will
this moment to happen.</i>

1292
01:39:02,937 --> 01:39:08,466
<i>And it was fun as an actor because Debra
wanted to get out of the hug.</i>

1293
01:39:08,575 --> 01:39:11,043
<i>Once the hug happened,
she desperately wanted out</i>

1294
01:39:11,145 --> 01:39:14,308
<i>and it was fun to just not let her out of it.</i>

1295
01:39:14,448 --> 01:39:19,613
<i>And to wait until the moment happened
where the three of them got to be together,</i>

1296
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:22,587
<i>even if it's just for this one moment
and if it never happens again.</i>

1297
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:28,287
<i>'Cause I'm not sure that it ever will happen
again. I think it was important to Rachel.</i>

1298
01:39:28,495 --> 01:39:32,431
<i>I think she's been trying to be
the glue of this family her whole life</i>

1299
01:39:32,666 --> 01:39:35,999
<i>and trying to bring them together
and she has one moment to do it.</i>

1300
01:39:36,103 --> 01:39:41,439
<i>And she just wants to have that
and she takes it.</i>

1301
01:39:41,542 --> 01:39:43,669
<i>And then I think something shifts.</i>

1302
01:39:43,777 --> 01:39:46,439
You're not going to get up early.
That was silly. Anyway...

1303
01:39:46,547 --> 01:39:50,813
I have to get Andrew ready
'cause he's absolutely hopeless in this way.

1304
01:39:50,918 --> 01:39:53,148
So...
We'll just be a bit and then we'll be back.

1305
01:39:53,253 --> 01:39:56,518
Everything was so lovely,
even the weather cooperated.

1306
01:39:56,623 --> 01:39:59,023
It was beautiful, honey. Okay.

1307
01:39:59,126 --> 01:40:00,491
Wait.

1308
01:40:02,863 --> 01:40:05,388
I want my mother and my sister.

1309
01:40:10,971 --> 01:40:12,598
- Congratulations, Daddy.
- Thanks.

1310
01:40:15,376 --> 01:40:17,207
All right, Rachel.

1311
01:40:18,812 --> 01:40:21,144
- All right, Rach. Okay.
- Okay.

1312
01:40:22,349 --> 01:40:26,046
- You'll call me every day about you know...
- Yes. Of course.

1313
01:40:27,621 --> 01:40:29,816
- You take care. All right?
- Bye.

1314
01:40:30,991 --> 01:40:33,619
- Son-in-law.
- Mother-in-law.

1315
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:39,198
Take care of yourself.

1316
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:42,995
<i>And you know we tried,
there's only so much hope for Abby.</i>

1317
01:40:43,103 --> 01:40:46,197
- Paul, Carol, it was so lovely.
- Thank you.

1318
01:40:46,306 --> 01:40:48,536
- Get some rest.
- Okay.

1319
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:54,738
<i>And then Kym wants to try one more time
and she just gets stopped.</i>

1320
01:40:57,851 --> 01:40:59,614
<i>It's so heartbreaking.</i>

1321
01:41:01,755 --> 01:41:03,086
Kymmie. Kym.

1322
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:07,350
You remember Susanna Galeano?

1323
01:41:07,461 --> 01:41:09,486
- Hi.
- Hi, Kym. How are you?

1324
01:41:09,596 --> 01:41:12,793
Suzy runs a first rate PR firm and, darling,

1325
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:15,130
she has just lost an office assistant.

1326
01:41:16,336 --> 01:41:19,032
We really are down a person.
And I was wondering,

1327
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:22,199
have you ever
thought about public relations?

1328
01:41:23,043 --> 01:41:25,477
The public's kind of afraid of me.

1329
01:41:26,713 --> 01:41:29,375
Listen, Suzy
is opening a new office right here.

1330
01:41:29,483 --> 01:41:31,781
- Darling, you could be at home.
- I tell you what.

1331
01:41:31,885 --> 01:41:33,648
- Why don't you call me on Monday?
- Give her a card.

1332
01:41:33,754 --> 01:41:36,018
- And we can talk about it?
- That would be great.

1333
01:41:36,123 --> 01:41:37,556
- This is just too perfect.
- It's stuck, here we go.

1334
01:41:37,658 --> 01:41:39,250
- Thank you.
- Paul, it was beautiful.

1335
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:41,452
- I'm gonna have to go.
- Suzy, Suzy, thank you. I know.

1336
01:41:41,562 --> 01:41:42,995
You look wonderful.

1337
01:41:43,397 --> 01:41:47,697
<i>Just now watching, it's striking me that
as much as this film's about the moments,</i>

1338
01:41:47,801 --> 01:41:50,736
<i>it's about the absence of them as well.</i>

1339
01:41:51,638 --> 01:41:56,837
<i>And the expectations of them and the ones
that don't happen, like this scene right here.</i>

1340
01:41:56,944 --> 01:42:00,004
<i>And I think families are full of those.</i>

1341
01:42:00,114 --> 01:42:03,083
<i>And then you just go on the best you can.</i>

1342
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:09,316
<i>And there's a missed one right there.</i>

1343
01:42:14,261 --> 01:42:17,788
<i>And that shot right there
I think is similar to the shot,</i>

1344
01:42:17,898 --> 01:42:20,366
<i>the very last scene when Kym's car pulls
away and we see the back of Rachel's neck.</i>

1345
01:42:20,401 --> 01:42:22,834
<i>The very last scene when Kym's car pulls
away and we see the back of Rachel's neck.</i>

1346
01:42:26,273 --> 01:42:29,037
<i>Even though there were
so few planned shots,</i>

1347
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:32,271
<i>sometimes there were those
happy accidents.</i>

1348
01:42:32,513 --> 01:42:36,279
<i>Or maybe they weren't accidents,
maybe Jonathan planned everything.</i>

1349
01:42:48,795 --> 01:42:50,387
<i>I think I shot the entire movie</i>

1350
01:42:50,497 --> 01:42:52,897
<i>under the assumption that
Kym was getting out of rehab for good.</i>

1351
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,661
<i>And when I watched the movie it looks as if</i>

1352
01:42:54,768 --> 01:42:58,329
<i>she was always out on,
sort of, a weekend pass.</i>

1353
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:02,975
<i>And maybe that changed
in the editing of the movie,</i>

1354
01:43:03,076 --> 01:43:08,537
<i>but it was so great because it kept
the stakes up really high, I think.</i>

1355
01:43:11,151 --> 01:43:15,053
<i>And it's funny to me that you can think
one thing while making a movie</i>

1356
01:43:15,155 --> 01:43:18,386
<i>and then see the movie and it's
something completely different.</i>

1357
01:43:19,026 --> 01:43:21,790
<i>I love this moment with Anisa right here.</i>

1358
01:43:26,733 --> 01:43:29,258
<i>She's awesome.</i>

1359
01:43:31,772 --> 01:43:32,761
Hello?

1360
01:43:36,009 --> 01:43:40,605
<i>And I love that there's no tightly wrapped
bow in this relationship either.</i>

1361
01:43:40,714 --> 01:43:43,911
<i>And, you know, maybe Kieran hooked up
with somebody else last night,</i>

1362
01:43:44,017 --> 01:43:47,919
<i>that he was dancing with, and yet
there is this bond there between them.</i>

1363
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:52,383
<i>So complicated.</i>

1364
01:43:54,494 --> 01:43:57,725
No. If you ever need anything.

1365
01:44:03,604 --> 01:44:04,901
Thank you.

1366
01:44:08,976 --> 01:44:11,501
Maybe you'll come visit me in Hawaii.

1367
01:44:12,879 --> 01:44:16,246
- That would be nice.
- Yes, it would.

1368
01:44:37,471 --> 01:44:39,666
- I got to go.
- Okay.

1369
01:44:40,741 --> 01:44:42,538
- I got it.
- Okay.

1370
01:44:49,316 --> 01:44:55,152
<i>And then she just can't say goodbye to
her father because he won't let her go.</i>

1371
01:44:59,059 --> 01:45:00,492
<i>He just can't.</i>

1372
01:45:08,568 --> 01:45:09,694
Daddy?

1373
01:45:14,174 --> 01:45:16,233
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1374
01:45:16,343 --> 01:45:18,937
- How you feeling?
- I'm okay.

1375
01:45:19,046 --> 01:45:20,536
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1376
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:27,480
You should probably just ignore the eye.
It's a long story.

1377
01:45:27,587 --> 01:45:29,179
- Okay.
- Kymmie.

1378
01:45:30,190 --> 01:45:31,214
Hey.

1379
01:45:32,793 --> 01:45:35,284
- Hey, I'm Kym's sister.
- Hi.

1380
01:45:35,395 --> 01:45:37,329
- This is Rosa.
- Rachel.

1381
01:45:37,431 --> 01:45:40,127
Rachel, I heard a lot about you.
You got married.

1382
01:45:40,233 --> 01:45:41,700
- I did, yeah.
- Congratulations.

1383
01:45:41,802 --> 01:45:43,064
Thank you.

1384
01:45:46,673 --> 01:45:49,141
<i>I think this was actually our last,</i>

1385
01:45:49,843 --> 01:45:52,437
<i>one of our last shots.</i>

1386
01:45:52,546 --> 01:45:53,877
<i>And that surrender,</i>

1387
01:45:55,716 --> 01:45:58,514
<i>what I was looking for,
I felt like it happened here.</i>

1388
01:46:01,788 --> 01:46:04,552
<i>It's sort of amazing how you</i>

1389
01:46:05,425 --> 01:46:07,325
<i>make a movie,</i>

1390
01:46:07,427 --> 01:46:12,364
<i>and you go through something and then
you as a person are really changed after it.</i>

1391
01:46:18,472 --> 01:46:22,738
<i>And I thought Declan would stay on the car.</i>

1392
01:46:22,843 --> 01:46:28,748
<i>I thought that would be the last shot
of the movie, the car driving off</i>

1393
01:46:29,683 --> 01:46:31,082
<i>into the distance.</i>

1394
01:46:31,184 --> 01:46:32,481
<i>But like every other shot in the movie,</i>

1395
01:46:32,586 --> 01:46:36,249
<i>they just kind of stay on you
and see what you're gonna do.</i>

1396
01:46:50,203 --> 01:46:54,333
<i>And then I always do that when I go
in the house that I grew up in,</i>

1397
01:46:54,441 --> 01:46:55,601
<i>I always touch the doorway.</i>

1398
01:46:55,709 --> 01:46:58,439
<i>So, I did it and Jonathan said, "Keep it. "</i>

1399
01:46:58,545 --> 01:47:03,642
<i>And then we get to just listen to the music
and life goes on.</i>

1400
01:47:09,823 --> 01:47:16,558
<i>I think eventually in this shot Jonathan
joined us, too, but by then he cut.</i>

1401
01:47:17,364 --> 01:47:19,798
<i>I went down there</i>

1402
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:24,269
<i>and listened to the music and pet the dog
and eventually he came, too.</i>

1403
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:31,707
<i>Well, that's it.
Thank you so much for watching our film</i>

1404
01:47:32,846 --> 01:47:37,408
<i>and we had an amazing time making it.</i>

1405
01:47:38,819 --> 01:47:41,219
<i>And thanks for being part of that.</i>
