1
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:34,401
- Hello, Sam.
- Hiya, Marty.

2
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:41,784
Your kid brother got married Sunday,
huh, Marty?

3
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,620
That's right, Mrs Fusari.
It was a very nice affair.

4
00:01:44,745 --> 00:01:48,833
- The tall fella with the moustache?
- No. No, that's my other brother Freddie.

5
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:52,712
Freddie got married about four years ago.
He lives on Webb Avenue.

6
00:01:52,838 --> 00:01:55,298
No, the one who got married
Sunday is Nicky.

7
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:58,969
I thought he was a big, fat fella.
Don't I meet him here one time?

8
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:01,639
A big, tall, fat fella,
tried to sell me insurance.

9
00:02:01,764 --> 00:02:04,850
Oh, no, that's my sister
Margaret's husband Frank.

10
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:07,437
Margaret married the insurance salesman.

11
00:02:07,562 --> 00:02:09,898
And my sister Rose
married the contractor.

12
00:02:10,023 --> 00:02:11,941
They moved to Detroit last year.

13
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:14,944
My other sister Frances,
she got married two years ago

14
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,406
in St John's Church
on Kingsbridge Avenue.

15
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:19,782
Oh, that was a very nice affair.

16
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:25,872
Well, let's see now. That'll be $1.79.
How's that with you, Mrs Fusari?

17
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:27,916
Well...

18
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:31,295
- Hey, Marty, I'm in a hurry!
- You're next right now, Mrs Canduso.

19
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,132
When you gonna get married, Marty?
You should be ashamed of yourself.

20
00:02:35,257 --> 00:02:39,929
All your brothers and sisters younger than
you. They get married, they got children.

21
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:45,727
I meet your mother. She say to me "Hey,
you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?"

22
00:02:45,852 --> 00:02:49,397
What's the matter with you? That's
no way. What's the matter with you?

23
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:51,858
- Mrs Fusari...
- You get married, you hear?

24
00:02:51,984 --> 00:02:55,945
- Mrs Fusari, Mrs Canduso's in a...
- My boy Frank was 19 when he married.

25
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,032
- What's the matter?
- That's swell.

26
00:02:58,157 --> 00:03:00,950
You should be ashamed of yourself!

27
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:04,829
- Marty, I want a pullet, about four pounds.
- Sure.

28
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:09,585
- I hear your kid brother got married.
- That's right. It was a very nice affair.

29
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,296
Marty, you oughta be
ashamed of yourself.

30
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,884
All your kid brothers and sisters
married and got children.

31
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:18,469
When are you gonna get married?

32
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:32,901
The Giants are gonna wind up
in the cellar! In the cellar!

33
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,822
Hey, Lou, turn on the Dodger game.

34
00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:42,036
- What happened?
- Yanks won both. They murdered 'em!

35
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:44,621
Any homers? Whoo!

36
00:03:46,749 --> 00:03:50,503
So anyway, Leo and me, we're sittin'
in the bar and these two girls come in.

37
00:03:50,628 --> 00:03:53,172
- Angie come in yet?
- So they come to the bar...

38
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:55,967
- Hey, Ange, you want a beer?
- Yeah, I guess so.

39
00:03:56,092 --> 00:03:59,471
- So I look over at the one next to me...
- Hey, Lou.

40
00:03:59,596 --> 00:04:01,097
- Hiya, Marty.
- Hiya, Ralph.

41
00:04:01,222 --> 00:04:04,810
I'm tellin' these guys about two nurses
Leo and me picked up in a joint.

42
00:04:04,935 --> 00:04:08,939
- Hey, Lou, let me have two beers.
- So let me tell ya about these two nurses.

43
00:04:09,064 --> 00:04:11,024
- Man, oh, man!
- How about that, huh?

44
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,610
- What you readin', Joe?
- Lou, turn the set off!

45
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:18,574
- They shouldn't sell magazines like this.
- Imagine the effect it has on adolescents.

46
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:20,535
Now, that's something, huh?

47
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,580
- I went out with a girl like that.
- You should live so long!

48
00:04:23,705 --> 00:04:26,374
Hey, Richie, the Yankees took two today.

49
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,126
Hey, Marty.

50
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:32,839
Hey, Marty, Leo and me, we got a date
with these two nurses tonight, you know?

51
00:04:32,964 --> 00:04:36,177
So we gotta take 'em somewheres first,
you know what I mean?

52
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:40,514
So I'm hard up for cash right now and I...

53
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,933
I owe you ten bucks already, don't I?

54
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,895
I'll find it somewhere else.

55
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,980
Hey. Hey, Richie.

56
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:51,400
That Ralph, boy,
he's always got girls but no money.

57
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:03,622
- See ya, Ralph.
- See ya, Joe.

58
00:05:03,747 --> 00:05:06,208
So, what do you feel like doin' tonight?

59
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:10,796
I don't know, Ange.
What do you feel like doin'?

60
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,175
Well, we oughta do somethin'.
It's Saturday night.

61
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,136
I don't wanna go bowlin'
like last Saturday.

62
00:05:20,723 --> 00:05:25,060
Hey, how about callin' up that big girl
we picked up in the movies a month ago

63
00:05:25,185 --> 00:05:27,647
up in the RKO Chester?

64
00:05:27,772 --> 00:05:30,983
- Which one was that?
- That big girl that was in front of us

65
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:34,403
- with the skinny friend.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

66
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:38,950
Her name was Mary Feeney. We took 'em
home all the way out in Brooklyn.

67
00:05:39,076 --> 00:05:42,830
What do you say? Think we oughta
give 'em a call? I'll take the skinny one.

68
00:05:42,955 --> 00:05:46,750
- She maybe got a date already, Ange.
- What can we lose?

69
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:50,379
I didn't like her.
I don't feel like callin' her up.

70
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:53,758
Well, what do you feel like doin' tonight?

71
00:05:53,883 --> 00:05:57,344
I don't know, Ange.
What do you feel like doin'?

72
00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:01,766
We're back to that, huh? I say
"What do you feel like doin' tonight?"

73
00:06:01,891 --> 00:06:04,852
You say back to me "I don't know.
What do you feel like doin'?"

74
00:06:04,977 --> 00:06:09,733
Then we wind up sittin' around your
house with a couple of cans of beer.

75
00:06:11,443 --> 00:06:13,904
I'll tell you what I feel like doin'.

76
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:17,615
I feel like callin' up this here Mary Feeney.

77
00:06:18,617 --> 00:06:20,994
She likes you.

78
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:23,079
What makes you say that?

79
00:06:23,204 --> 00:06:26,333
- Man, I could see she likes ya.
- Yeah, sure.

80
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:30,087
- Call her up.
- You call her up yourself. I don't want to.

81
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:35,635
Well, how about goin' down 72nd Street?

82
00:06:37,178 --> 00:06:39,639
See what we can find down there?

83
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,812
Ralph says you gotta beat 'em off with
clubs. Boy, you're gettin' to be a real drag!

84
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:48,482
I been lookin' for a girl
every Saturday night.

85
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:51,151
I'm 34. I'm just tired of lookin', that's all!

86
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:54,864
I'd like to find a girl!
Everybody's tellin' me "Get married."

87
00:06:54,989 --> 00:06:59,451
Don't you think I wanna get married?
I want to. Everybody drives me crazy.

88
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:04,790
I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night.
You go somewhere. I don't wanna go.

89
00:07:04,915 --> 00:07:09,128
Boy, my old lady, too. Every word out of
her mouth: "When you gettin' married?"

90
00:07:09,253 --> 00:07:11,964
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.

91
00:07:20,682 --> 00:07:22,517
So...

92
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,896
What do you feel like doin' tonight?

93
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:31,068
I don't know, Ange.

94
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,114
- What do you feel like doin'?
- Hello. Yeah, he's here.

95
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:39,493
- Marty, your mother's on the phone.
- My mother?

96
00:07:39,618 --> 00:07:42,038
He's comin' now, Mrs Piletti.

97
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:46,334
- Hey, Marty. I'm goin' home.
- Listen, Ange, come on over about 7.30.

98
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:50,339
We'll think of somethin'.
Hello, Ma. What's the matter?

99
00:07:50,464 --> 00:07:56,344
Your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia,
they're here and waitin' to see you.

100
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:58,681
OK, Ma. I'll be home in two minutes.

101
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:01,933
Listen, Ma, tell Thomas to stick around.
I wanna see him.

102
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:06,021
OK. You come on home, huh? OK.

103
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:11,527
Marty's coming home.

104
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:15,906
So what happened about this milk bottle
was, my mother-in-law is in the kitchen,

105
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:19,452
she begins pokin' her head
over my shoulder here and there.

106
00:08:19,578 --> 00:08:24,624
Then she tells me how I waste money, I
can't cook and I'm raisin' my baby wrong.

107
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:27,502
She got me so nervous
I spilled the milk for the baby.

108
00:08:27,627 --> 00:08:29,796
Tommy, your mother is my sister, but...

109
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:34,927
So she says "You're spillin' the milk."
She kept talkin' about these drops of milk.

110
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:39,765
Finally she got me so mad I said "Mama,
you wanna see me really spill milk?"

111
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,518
So I picked up the bottle
and I threw it at the door.

112
00:08:42,643 --> 00:08:45,563
I didn't throw it at her.
That's something she made up.

113
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:48,358
She tells everybody
I threw a bottle of milk at her.

114
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:50,777
I didn't throw it anywheres near her.

115
00:08:50,902 --> 00:08:54,072
Anyway, I was sorry,
but she ran out of the house and I...

116
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:59,786
I don't know what you want me to do, but,
if you want me to, I come and talk to her.

117
00:09:00,245 --> 00:09:02,956
- Well, Aunt Theresa, we...
- Let me tell it, Tommy.

118
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,209
OK.

119
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:08,838
Aunt Theresa, we want you
to do a very big favour for us.

120
00:09:08,963 --> 00:09:10,172
Sure.

121
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:12,508
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here.

122
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:15,344
You got this big house
just for you and Marty.

123
00:09:15,469 --> 00:09:18,765
I thought Tommy's mother
could come and live with you and Marty.

124
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,892
- Well...
- I talked to Tommy's brother

125
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:26,397
and I said "You gotta take her for
a couple of years!" And he says "Oh, no!"

126
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:29,901
- I sound terrible...
- No, Virginia. I know how you feel.

127
00:09:30,026 --> 00:09:34,405
I just can't stand it any more! Every
minute of the day! Do this! Do that!

128
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,536
I don't have ten minutes privacy with
my husband. We can't even have a fight.

129
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,704
We don't have any privacy!

130
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:44,583
- All right, Ginnie. Don't get so excited.
- She's right, Tommy.

131
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,461
A young husband and wife
should have their own home.

132
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:53,593
And my sister Caterina, well... she's my
sister, but I must say she's an old goat.

133
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:58,139
And plenty of time in my life I feel like
throw the milk bottle at her myself.

134
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:04,229
But I tell you right now, if Caterina wants
to come and live here with Marty and me,

135
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,607
it's all right with me.

136
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,860
That's very nice of you, Aunt Theresa.

137
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:13,071
- Of course, we gotta ask Marty first.
- Sure, sure.

138
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,868
Sit here. I go in the kitchen
and turn a little fire under the cooking.

139
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:19,370
That's very nice of you, Aunt Theresa.

140
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:29,297
How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?

141
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:34,468
Oh, he's fine.
You know a nice girl he can marry?

142
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:36,764
Oh, don't worry. He'll get married.

143
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:40,809
I don't know.
He sits around the house all the time.

144
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,939
You know a nice place
where he can go to get a bride?

145
00:10:47,024 --> 00:10:50,110
There's the Stardust Ballroom.
That's a big dance hall.

146
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:53,739
Every Saturday night
it's loaded with girls. It's a nice place.

147
00:10:53,864 --> 00:10:58,161
You pay 77 cents. Well, it used to be 77
cents. Probably a dollar and a half now.

148
00:10:58,286 --> 00:11:00,455
You go in and ask some girl to dance.

149
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,291
It's a respectable...
That's where I met Virginia.

150
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:07,713
You tell Marty to go to the Stardust
Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.

151
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:12,009
"The Stardust Ballroom.
It's loaded with tomatoes."

152
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:12,843
Right.

153
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:17,056
Aunt Theresa, this is so nice of you.
I want you to know we appreciate it.

154
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:21,185
He's here.

155
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:27,609
- Hello, Marty.
- Hello, Ma.

156
00:11:28,609 --> 00:11:30,695
Thomas and Virginia are here.

157
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,074
They just had another big fight
with your Aunt Caterina,

158
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:36,993
so they ask me if it's OK
Caterina come live here.

159
00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:40,497
I said all right with me,
but we gotta ask you.

160
00:11:40,622 --> 00:11:44,209
Marty, she's a lonely old woman.
Nobody wants her.

161
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:47,755
Everybody's throwing her out they house.

162
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,759
- Well, sure, Ma. It's OK with me.
- You got a good heart.

163
00:11:54,636 --> 00:11:59,266
- Marty say it's all right she come here.
- Thanks. Takes a load off of my mind.

164
00:11:59,391 --> 00:12:02,937
- We got plenty of room here.
- Oh, it's gonna be nice.

165
00:12:03,062 --> 00:12:07,317
I come over tonight, I talk to Caterina.
Everything is gonna work out all right.

166
00:12:07,442 --> 00:12:10,319
I wanna thank you
because it was becoming impossible.

167
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:12,280
Sit down, Thomas. Sit down.

168
00:12:12,405 --> 00:12:16,117
Marty, I appreciate what you
and your mother are doing because...

169
00:12:16,242 --> 00:12:18,912
- Oh.
- No, listen. What was happening...

170
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:21,581
Virginia was makin' milk and my mother...

171
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:24,293
- I promised the baby-sitter six o'clock.
- OK.

172
00:12:24,418 --> 00:12:28,255
- Before you go, I need some advice.
- Sure. What?

173
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,344
Well, you're the accountant in the family.
My boss wants to sell his shop to me.

174
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:36,431
- Oh, yeah?
- Well, him and his wife live alone.

175
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:41,311
They wanna move out to California
and live near their married daughter.

176
00:12:41,436 --> 00:12:45,231
Well, he wants $5,000 down, although
I think I can knock him down to four.

177
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:47,693
Tommy!

178
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:51,113
Marty, I gotta run now,
but I'll meet you at mass tomorrow.

179
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:54,742
Afterwards we'll discuss it.
It sounds like a good proposition.

180
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:57,912
- OK. He wants an answer by Monday.
- Oh, sure.

181
00:12:58,996 --> 00:13:03,083
We'll work out an arrangement
about my mother. I wanna pay you...

182
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,043
- No, listen...
- Tommy!

183
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:08,005
We'll talk about it later. Thanks again.

184
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,925
- Goodbye, Marty.
- Goodbye, Virginia. See ya soon.

185
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:15,764
- Goodbye, Aunt Theresa.
- Goodbye, Aunt Theresa. Thank you.

186
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:20,999
Hello. Is this Mary Feeney?

187
00:14:21,124 --> 00:14:24,044
Well, could I speak to Miss Mary Feeney?

188
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:26,630
Just tell her an old friend.

189
00:14:33,762 --> 00:14:35,806
Oh, hello there. Is this Mary Feeney?

190
00:14:35,931 --> 00:14:40,061
Hello there. This is Marty Piletti.
I wonder if you recall me.

191
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:45,732
Well, I'm kind of a stocky guy. The last
time we met was in the RKO Chester.

192
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:49,570
You was with a friend of yours and
I was with a friend of mine name of Angie.

193
00:14:49,695 --> 00:14:51,948
This was about a month ago.

194
00:14:53,616 --> 00:14:56,077
The RKO Chester on West Farms Square.

195
00:14:57,954 --> 00:15:02,333
Yeah, you was sittin' in front of us and
we was annoyin' ya and you got mad.

196
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:05,253
I'm the fella who works in a butcher shop.

197
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,966
Oh, come on, you know who I am.

198
00:15:10,634 --> 00:15:15,139
That's right! And then we went to
Howard Johnson's. You had a milk shake.

199
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:19,519
Yeah, that's right.
I'm the stocky one, the heavyset fella.

200
00:15:21,395 --> 00:15:26,317
Yeah. Well, I'm glad you recall me,
because I had a pretty nice time that night

201
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:29,530
and I was wonderin'
how everything was with you.

202
00:15:31,322 --> 00:15:33,784
How's everything?

203
00:15:35,744 --> 00:15:37,787
That's swell.

204
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:43,043
Yeah, well, I'll tell you why I called.
I was figurin' on takin' in a movie tonight

205
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:47,255
and I was wonderin' if you and your friend
would care to see a movie tonight

206
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,424
with me and my friend.

207
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:52,762
Yeah, tonight.

208
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:59,019
I know it's a little late to call for a date,
but I didn't know myself till...

209
00:16:01,937 --> 00:16:03,981
Yeah, I know.

210
00:16:04,816 --> 00:16:06,860
Yeah, well, what about...

211
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,990
Well, how about next Saturday night?
Are you free next Saturday night?

212
00:16:15,202 --> 00:16:17,872
Well, what about the Saturday after that?

213
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,877
Yeah.

214
00:16:24,002 --> 00:16:26,214
Yeah, I know.

215
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:28,383
Oh, I mean, I understand that...

216
00:16:30,676 --> 00:16:32,511
Yeah.

217
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:37,017
Yeah.

218
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:13,972
So, what are you
gonna do tonight, Marty?

219
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:17,893
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out.
I may just hang around the house.

220
00:17:18,018 --> 00:17:20,729
Why don't you go to
the Stardust Ballroom?

221
00:17:20,854 --> 00:17:22,064
What?

222
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:27,694
I say "Why don't you go to the Stardust
Ballroom?" It's loaded with tomatoes.

223
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:30,573
- It's loaded with what?
- Tomatoes.

224
00:17:30,698 --> 00:17:33,868
Who told you about
the Stardust Ballroom, Ma?

225
00:17:33,993 --> 00:17:38,122
- Tommy. He say it's very nice place.
- Oh, Thomas!

226
00:17:38,247 --> 00:17:42,126
Ma, it's just a big dance hall, that's all.
I been there a hundred times.

227
00:17:42,251 --> 00:17:44,879
Loaded with tomatoes!
Boy, you're funny, Ma.

228
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:48,217
Marty, I don't want you
hanging around the house tonight.

229
00:17:48,342 --> 00:17:51,845
- I want you go shave and go dance.
- Ma, when are you gonna give up?

230
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,808
- You got a bachelor on your hands.
- You gonna get married.

231
00:17:55,933 --> 00:18:00,271
Ma, sooner or later there comes a point
in a man's life when he's gotta face facts.

232
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:03,900
One fact I gotta face is
whatever it is women like, I ain't got it.

233
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:07,278
I chased after enough girls in my life.
I went to enough dances.

234
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:09,905
I got hurt enough.
I don't wanna get hurt no more.

235
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:13,452
I just called up a girl this afternoon.
I got a real brushoff, boy.

236
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:16,495
I figured I was past the point
of bein' hurt, but that hurt.

237
00:18:16,622 --> 00:18:20,458
Some stupid woman who I didn't even
wanna call up. She gave me the brush.

238
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,711
I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom.

239
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:26,965
All that ever happened to me there
was girls made me feel like I was a bug.

240
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:30,594
I got feelings, you know.
I had enough pain. No, thanks, Ma.

241
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:32,430
- Marty...
- No.

242
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:34,640
I'm gonna stay home tonight.

243
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:37,518
- You gonna die without a son.
- So I'll die without a son.

244
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:41,272
- Marty, put on the blue suit, huh?
- Blue suit, grey suit.

245
00:18:41,397 --> 00:18:44,734
I'm just a fat, little man. A fat, ugly man.

246
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:47,571
- You not ugly.
- I'm ugly! I'm ugly! I'm ugly!

247
00:18:47,696 --> 00:18:50,156
- Marty.
- Ma! Leave me alone!

248
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:56,371
Ma, what do you want from me?
I'm miserable enough as it is.

249
00:18:56,496 --> 00:19:00,291
All right, I'll go to the Stardust Ballroom.
I'll put on a blue suit and go.

250
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:05,380
You know what I'm gonna get for my
trouble? Heartache. A night of heartache!

251
00:19:20,062 --> 00:19:23,149
Loaded with tomatoes!

252
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:25,401
That's rich.

253
00:19:53,848 --> 00:19:56,727
- Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
- Yeah.

254
00:19:57,811 --> 00:20:01,481
There was a nice-lookin' one over there
with the black dress on.

255
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:03,858
But she's dancin' now.

256
00:20:05,193 --> 00:20:08,739
Hey, there's a nice-lookin',
little short one for you down there.

257
00:20:08,864 --> 00:20:11,993
- Where?
- Down there. That little one down there.

258
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:17,540
Oh, yeah.

259
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:20,209
What do you say? Wanna ask 'em?

260
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:23,421
I'll take the one
with the flowers on her dress.

261
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:28,176
Well, I think this music's a little fast.

262
00:20:28,301 --> 00:20:30,345
Just a minute.

263
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:38,354
Yeah, I think it's all right.
Are they still over there?

264
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:04,965
What do you say? You wanna dance?

265
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:13,348
Uh, excuse me. Would you care to dance?

266
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:16,977
- I don't feel like dancin' just yet.
- Sure.

267
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:51,138
Clara, have you decided about tomorrow?

268
00:21:51,264 --> 00:21:54,433
Millie, I always go to the movies
with Papa on Sunday.

269
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,105
- I know, but you could have a lot of fun.
- I'm gonna get some cigarettes.

270
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:07,613
Herb, I told you she wasn't especially
attractive, but she had a lot of charm.

271
00:22:07,738 --> 00:22:09,907
Look, Herb, she's a real nice kid.

272
00:22:10,034 --> 00:22:14,329
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get
one Saturday night off every three weeks.

273
00:22:14,454 --> 00:22:16,498
I was expecting somethin' better.

274
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:20,335
- D'you like him, Clara?
- Yes. He seems very nice.

275
00:22:21,212 --> 00:22:25,216
- Millie's been after me to fix her up.
- All right, I'm having a fair time.

276
00:22:25,341 --> 00:22:30,137
I get one Saturday night off in three weeks
and I wanted to wind up with something.

277
00:22:30,262 --> 00:22:32,306
- OK. So I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

278
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:04,508
- Herbie, have you ever been here before?
- Hey!

279
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,468
Herbie!

280
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:10,555
- What are you doing here?
- I came up to dance. What do you think?

281
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,142
- You here with somebody?
- I'm just here with another girl.

282
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:18,647
- Where you goin' now?
- For some cigarettes. Left 'em in my coat.

283
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,650
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah, I'll see ya.

284
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,741
Oh, that's a... girl I used to know.

285
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:45,050
- Boy, it's sure packed in here.
- Some of these kids are awfully young.

286
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,468
You might run into one of your students.

287
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,055
I wouldn't think so.
I teach out in Brooklyn.

288
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,143
- Oh, you been here before, Clara?
- Yes. Twice.

289
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:58,689
You wanna try and get a table and a drink,
or you just wanna start dancing?

290
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:03,027
Well, Herb... Herb! What do you say?
We grab a table before we dance?

291
00:24:03,152 --> 00:24:07,114
Listen, you people go grab a table.
I'll be back in a minute.

292
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:09,283
I'll be right back.

293
00:24:10,326 --> 00:24:13,830
What do you say, Clara, huh?
Come on, we'll grab a table.

294
00:24:44,236 --> 00:24:48,700
- You here stag or with a girl?
- You say somethin'?

295
00:24:48,825 --> 00:24:51,912
Yeah. I was askin' you
if you was here stag or with a girl.

296
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:56,667
- Oh, I'm stag.
- I got stuck on a blind date with a dog.

297
00:24:56,792 --> 00:25:01,130
I just met an old girl I used to know,
so I need to get rid of the girl I'm with.

298
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:04,091
Somebody to take her home,
you know what I mean?

299
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:08,513
- I'd pay you $5 if you take her home.
- What?

300
00:25:08,638 --> 00:25:12,516
I'll introduce you as an old army buddy
of mine and then I'll cut out,

301
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:17,856
because I got this other girl waiting for
me by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you $5.

302
00:25:17,981 --> 00:25:20,692
- Are you kiddin'?
- No, I'm not kiddin'.

303
00:25:22,027 --> 00:25:24,905
You just can't walk off on a girl like that!

304
00:26:49,744 --> 00:26:52,788
As long as she's goin' home alone,
give me the $5 back.

305
00:26:52,914 --> 00:26:55,667
Look, Mac, you paid me the $5.
The $5 is mine.

306
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:53,977
Excuse me, miss,
but would you care to dance?

307
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,525
Miss?

308
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:44,531
- You come up here often?
- I was up here twice before.

309
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:48,035
Once I came up with a friend of mine
and... once alone.

310
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,538
The last time...

311
00:28:52,706 --> 00:28:55,543
You see that girl sitting over there
in the grey dress?

312
00:28:55,668 --> 00:28:56,794
Yeah.

313
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:00,631
Well, the last time I was here,
that's where I sat.

314
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:05,887
I sat there for an hour and a half
without moving a muscle.

315
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:12,394
Now and then some fellow would kind of
come up to me and then change his mind.

316
00:29:14,562 --> 00:29:19,193
I'll never forget just sitting there for an
hour and a half with my hands in my lap.

317
00:29:19,318 --> 00:29:22,154
Then I began to cry.
I had to get up and go home.

318
00:29:23,363 --> 00:29:25,949
I've begun to cry a lot lately.

319
00:29:26,074 --> 00:29:29,286
I cry a lot, too. I'm a big crier.

320
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:33,957
This is something recent with me, this
bursting into tears at the slightest thing.

321
00:29:34,082 --> 00:29:36,752
I cry all the time, any little thing.

322
00:29:36,877 --> 00:29:41,758
My brothers, my brothers-in-law always
tell me what a good-hearted guy I am.

323
00:29:41,883 --> 00:29:43,926
You're not good-hearted by accident.

324
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:48,348
You get kicked around long enough,
you get to be a real professor of pain.

325
00:29:48,473 --> 00:29:50,476
I know exactly how you feel.

326
00:29:50,601 --> 00:29:55,688
I also want you to know I'm having a good
time with you and really enjoyin' myself.

327
00:29:55,815 --> 00:29:59,192
So, you see, you're not such a dog
as you think you are.

328
00:30:04,156 --> 00:30:07,201
I'm having a very good time, too.

329
00:30:07,326 --> 00:30:11,705
So there you are. So I guess
I'm not such a dog as I think I am.

330
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,167
No, you're a very nice guy.

331
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:17,921
I don't know why some girl
hasn't grabbed you off long ago.

332
00:30:18,046 --> 00:30:21,758
Well, I don't know either.
I think I'm a very nice guy.

333
00:30:21,883 --> 00:30:26,096
I also think I'm a pretty smart guy
in my own way. Excuse me.

334
00:30:26,221 --> 00:30:31,184
I figure two people get married and
they're gonna live together 40, 50 years,

335
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:35,398
so it's gotta be more than
whether they're just good-lookin' or not.

336
00:30:35,523 --> 00:30:37,608
You think you're not so good-lookin'.

337
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:41,654
Well, my father was a real ugly man,
but my mother adored him.

338
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:45,783
She told me how she'd get so miserable
sometimes, like everybody, you know?

339
00:30:45,908 --> 00:30:49,996
And she says my father
always tried to understand.

340
00:30:50,121 --> 00:30:54,960
I used to see them sometimes when
I was a kid sittin' in the livin' room talkin',

341
00:30:55,085 --> 00:30:59,089
and I used to adore my old man,
because he was always so kind.

342
00:30:59,214 --> 00:31:03,719
That's one of the most beautiful things I
have in my life - the way my parents were.

343
00:31:03,844 --> 00:31:06,263
And my father was a real ugly man.

344
00:31:06,388 --> 00:31:09,308
So it doesn't matter
if you look like a gorilla.

345
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:12,895
See, dogs like us,
we ain't such dogs as we think we are.

346
00:31:19,026 --> 00:31:21,696
I'm 29 years old.

347
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,324
How old are you?

348
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,910
I'm 34.

349
00:31:47,556 --> 00:31:51,560
- Oh, hello, Aunt Theresa. Come on in.
- Is Caterina here?

350
00:31:51,685 --> 00:31:54,564
We didn't say anything.
We thought we'd leave it to you.

351
00:31:54,689 --> 00:31:58,985
We thought you'd put it like how you were
lonely and why doesn't she live with you.

352
00:31:59,111 --> 00:32:04,907
That way it looks like she's doing you
a favour, instead of we're throwin' her out.

353
00:32:05,034 --> 00:32:09,996
- You want Tommy and me to stay?
- No. It's better idea if you and Tommy go,

354
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:13,959
otherwise she's gonna start to fight
with you and everybody be yelling.

355
00:32:14,084 --> 00:32:16,128
- Hello, Aunt Theresa.
- Hello, Thomas.

356
00:32:16,253 --> 00:32:18,672
Who's there? Who's there?

357
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:22,176
- It's me, Caterina! How you feel?
- Hey, what are you doin' here?

358
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:24,262
I come to see you. How you feel?

359
00:32:24,387 --> 00:32:27,682
I got a pain on my left side
and my leg throbs like a drum.

360
00:32:27,807 --> 00:32:31,977
- I been getting pain in my shoulder.
- Hah! I got a pain in my shoulder, too.

361
00:32:32,104 --> 00:32:37,150
I got a pain in my hip and
my right arm aches so much I can't sleep.

362
00:32:37,275 --> 00:32:39,612
Ah, it's a curse to be old.

363
00:32:39,737 --> 00:32:43,699
We got a postcard from
my son Nicky and his bride.

364
00:32:43,824 --> 00:32:47,202
They are in Florida in a big hotel
on their honeymoon.

365
00:32:47,786 --> 00:32:51,957
I got a letter from
my husband's cousin in Abruzzi.

366
00:32:52,082 --> 00:32:54,501
- His mother die.
- Oh.

367
00:32:54,627 --> 00:32:58,589
You remember Emilio DiGiorgio,
who own a tavern in Abruzzi?

368
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,300
- He die.
- Oh.

369
00:33:01,425 --> 00:33:05,304
- You know who else die?
- Who?

370
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:12,228
You know the old man who live upstairs
in this house? Irishman, always drunk.

371
00:33:12,353 --> 00:33:17,692
He get pleurisy. He stay two weeks
in a hospital. Yesterday he die.

372
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:24,575
I like to visit you, Caterina, because
you always got such cheerful news.

373
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,329
Hey, kids. Why don't you two kids
go to the movies?

374
00:33:28,454 --> 00:33:30,748
Your mother and me, we be baby-sitter.

375
00:33:30,873 --> 00:33:34,627
- Let's go down to the Kaplans'.
- Sure, sure.

376
00:33:34,752 --> 00:33:38,882
Ma, we'll be down at the Kaplans'
if you want us for anything. OK?

377
00:33:45,764 --> 00:33:48,975
I wake up this morning.
I hear the baby cry, so I wake up.

378
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,230
I come in their room, and that girl,
she's shakin' her hand at the baby.

379
00:33:53,355 --> 00:33:58,361
I said "You brute! Don't you strike
that baby! That's my son's baby!"

380
00:33:58,486 --> 00:34:00,947
- It's her baby, too.
- It's my son Thomas's baby.

381
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,698
But it's not your baby.

382
00:34:02,823 --> 00:34:04,867
I tell you she throw a bottle of milk at me?

383
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:06,911
I know. I know.

384
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:09,997
She's a witch, that one, I tell you.

385
00:34:10,122 --> 00:34:12,375
- I tell you what she do yesterday?
- What?

386
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,836
- She give me the evil eye.
- Uffa Caterina.

387
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:20,425
I keep one eye open when I sleep,
because she's gonna stab me in my bed.

388
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:24,804
Caterina, I want you to come
and live with me in my house.

389
00:34:25,181 --> 00:34:26,598
Hm?

390
00:34:26,723 --> 00:34:30,395
Your son Thomas and his wife,
they come to my house today.

391
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:33,689
They say things
are no good in this house.

392
00:34:33,815 --> 00:34:36,567
Caterina, your son is married.

393
00:34:36,692 --> 00:34:40,321
Leave him in peace.
He wants to be alone with his wife.

394
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:43,115
They don't want no old woman
sittin' in the balcony.

395
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,120
My son Thomas
come to see you this afternoon,

396
00:34:47,246 --> 00:34:51,667
and he say to you he's gonna
throw his mother from this house?

397
00:34:51,999 --> 00:34:56,296
Ooh, Caterina,
don't make an opera out of this.

398
00:34:56,421 --> 00:34:59,675
The three of you and a little baby
in three skinny little rooms.

399
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:04,721
You know this is no good - old woman
living with a husband and wife.

400
00:35:04,846 --> 00:35:07,600
Two women in the same kitchen,
the house burns up.

401
00:35:07,725 --> 00:35:11,395
So I'm an old garbage bag
put in the street, huh?

402
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,398
Caterina, don't make a tragedy.

403
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,737
Come and live in my house where
you know you be more happier yourself.

404
00:35:22,157 --> 00:35:24,451
It pains they should do this.

405
00:35:27,204 --> 00:35:29,915
I know it pains.

406
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,835
These are the worst years, I tell you.

407
00:35:34,128 --> 00:35:37,423
Caterina, you are very dear to me.

408
00:35:38,341 --> 00:35:41,386
We cried lots of times together.

409
00:35:41,511 --> 00:35:46,641
When my poor husband, he die,
I would be crazy if not for you.

410
00:35:46,766 --> 00:35:52,021
I ask you to come to my house,
because I know I can make you happy.

411
00:35:52,146 --> 00:35:54,399
Please come to my house, Caterina.

412
00:35:55,316 --> 00:35:57,987
These are the worst years, I tell you.

413
00:35:58,112 --> 00:36:00,280
It's gonna happen to you.

414
00:36:00,405 --> 00:36:02,449
I'm afraid to look in a mirror.

415
00:36:02,574 --> 00:36:06,996
I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with
white hair, like the old ladies in the park -

416
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:11,375
little bundles in black shawl,
waiting for the coffin.

417
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,337
I'm 56 years old,
and what I got to do with myself?

418
00:36:15,462 --> 00:36:19,550
I got strength in my hands.
I wanna clean, I wanna cook.

419
00:36:19,675 --> 00:36:22,262
I wanna make dinner for my children.

420
00:36:22,387 --> 00:36:27,017
Am I an old dog to lay near the fire
till my eyes close?

421
00:36:27,142 --> 00:36:31,605
These are terrible years, Theresa.
Terrible years.

422
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:36,444
Caterina, listen...

423
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:40,155
It's gonna happen to you.
It's gonna happen to you!

424
00:36:41,281 --> 00:36:44,701
What are you gonna do
if Marty gets married, huh?

425
00:36:44,826 --> 00:36:46,870
What are you gonna cook?

426
00:36:46,995 --> 00:36:51,876
Where's all the children playin'
in all the rooms? Where's the noise?

427
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:55,713
It's a curse to be a widow. A curse!

428
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,760
What are you gonna do
if Marty gets married?

429
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:02,137
What are you gonna do?

430
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,060
I'm gonna put my things in a bag,

431
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:11,897
and I come to you tomorrow.

432
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:25,453
Don't worry. We'll come right back.

433
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:27,371
You teach chemistry? What school?

434
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:30,207
- Benjamin Franklin High School.
- In Brooklyn?

435
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:33,586
I went to Theodore Roosevelt
on Fordham Road. It's near my house.

436
00:37:33,711 --> 00:37:36,589
I have a cousin who's a teacher.
He teaches Latin.

437
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:39,425
He was studying to be a priest,
but he gave it up.

438
00:37:39,552 --> 00:37:42,638
I was pretty good in high school.
I sound like a jerk now.

439
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:44,932
I got an 82 average. That ain't bad.

440
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:49,102
I was accepted at City College, but
my old man died, so I had to go to work.

441
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:50,646
Want some cigarettes?

442
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:53,482
German was my best class.
That was my best language.

443
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:57,111
Der, die, das. Des, der, des.
There you are, I still remember.

444
00:37:58,571 --> 00:38:01,283
You know what I was
good at in high school? Math.

445
00:38:01,408 --> 00:38:04,869
You know how long ago
I graduated high school? June 1937.

446
00:38:04,994 --> 00:38:09,999
Holy cow! June 1937!
What is that? 15... 17 years ago!

447
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:14,212
Holy cow! Seven... Let's see, is that right?
Yeah, 17. That's right.

448
00:38:14,337 --> 00:38:19,760
Where'd it all go? I'm gettin' old. I'm
gonna be 35 years old November 8th. 35!

449
00:38:19,885 --> 00:38:22,013
Wow! Time goes on, boy!

450
00:38:22,138 --> 00:38:24,431
Yeah. 19... June 1937.

451
00:38:24,556 --> 00:38:28,644
My old man died December 1937.
Two o'clock in the mornin', he died.

452
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:32,773
Bell rings. I knew somethin' was wrong
because my room is on the ground floor.

453
00:38:32,899 --> 00:38:36,402
I had to get outta bed to answer the door,
and there was Mr Stern.

454
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:40,324
He had a house down about a block away
from us. He moved out, though.

455
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:44,286
My old man played cards with him and
some other guys. He was a Jewish fella.

456
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:49,374
So he said "Is your mother home?"
So I knew there was somethin' wrong.

457
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:52,794
I was only 18, exactly 18 years old
just a month before.

458
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,591
So I said "Is something wrong, Mr Stern?"
I was in my pyjamas.

459
00:38:56,716 --> 00:38:59,468
So he said "Marty, your father died."

460
00:38:59,593 --> 00:39:03,013
My father died right in the middle
of playin' cards, at the table.

461
00:39:03,138 --> 00:39:05,850
He had a heart attack.
He had low blood pressure.

462
00:39:05,975 --> 00:39:08,602
He used to faint a lot, you know.

463
00:39:08,729 --> 00:39:10,771
Boy... Boy, am I talkin'!

464
00:39:10,898 --> 00:39:13,859
Excuse me.
I never talked so much in all my life.

465
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:16,362
Usually everybody tells me their troubles.

466
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,614
Well, I'm gonna shut up now
and let you get a word in.

467
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:22,326
Yeah, 17 years ago.

468
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:25,328
What I been doin' with myself
all that time?

469
00:39:25,455 --> 00:39:28,582
Well, there I go again!
I must be drivin' you crazy.

470
00:39:28,707 --> 00:39:31,877
Most of the time I'm with a girl
I... I can't find a word to say.

471
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:35,799
I'm gonna shut up and let you get a word
in, because usually I'm not like this.

472
00:39:35,924 --> 00:39:37,759
Usually I...

473
00:39:37,884 --> 00:39:40,845
There I go again! I can't stop talkin'.

474
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:44,098
I'm on a jag, for Pete's sakes!
You'd think I was loaded.

475
00:39:44,224 --> 00:39:47,393
Well, anyway, like... like I started to say...

476
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,563
Ahi!

477
00:39:51,648 --> 00:39:54,944
I can't stop my mouth. Isn't this stupid?

478
00:39:56,529 --> 00:39:58,697
You got a real nice face, you know.

479
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:01,075
Really, a nice face.

480
00:40:02,034 --> 00:40:03,786
Thank you.

481
00:40:55,632 --> 00:40:59,136
- Hey, Mac. Anything good inside?
- A bunch of dogs.

482
00:41:03,348 --> 00:41:05,392
Hey, Marty.

483
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,353
Marty, you in here?

484
00:41:35,925 --> 00:41:37,551
So I'm in a kneeling position,

485
00:41:37,676 --> 00:41:42,014
and if you ever tried shootin' a BAR in a
kneeling position, you know what I mean.

486
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:45,977
I can't hold a steady position.
I'm waverin' back and forth.

487
00:41:47,437 --> 00:41:50,356
So the guy next to me,
he's shootin' from a prone position,

488
00:41:50,482 --> 00:41:52,858
and he's cross-eyed, like I told you.

489
00:41:56,153 --> 00:41:58,782
So just then...

490
00:41:58,907 --> 00:42:02,619
So just then I hear five shots go off
from the guy next to me.

491
00:42:04,538 --> 00:42:09,543
My target goes down. A minute later
the flag comes up. I got five bull's-eyes!

492
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:18,093
That's how I got the reputation of being
the best shot in the whole battalion!

493
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,113
So when I got out of the army,
Clara, I was lost.

494
00:42:36,238 --> 00:42:39,032
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

495
00:42:39,158 --> 00:42:41,327
I was 25 years old.

496
00:42:41,452 --> 00:42:45,081
What was I gonna do?
Go back to my old job, 40 cents an hour?

497
00:42:46,207 --> 00:42:49,835
I thought maybe I'd go to college
under the GI Bill of Rights.

498
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:57,051
But my brother Freddie wanted to get
married and I had three unmarried sisters.

499
00:42:57,176 --> 00:43:00,304
In an Italian house, that's a terrible thing.

500
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:03,308
So I just went to pieces.

501
00:43:05,227 --> 00:43:09,481
I used to walk the streets
till three, four o'clock in the mornin'.

502
00:43:11,566 --> 00:43:15,905
My poor mother...
used to be so worried about me.

503
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:24,247
God forgive me what
I'm gonna say now, but...

504
00:43:26,123 --> 00:43:28,918
I used to think of doin' away with myself.

505
00:43:30,503 --> 00:43:35,675
I used to stand on the subway and,
God forgive me what I'm gonna say, I...

506
00:43:36,843 --> 00:43:39,846
I used to feel the tracks
suckin' me down under the wheels.

507
00:43:39,971 --> 00:43:41,597
Yes, I know.

508
00:43:41,724 --> 00:43:45,853
I'm Catholic, you know. Even
to think about suicide is a terrible sin.

509
00:43:46,311 --> 00:43:48,564
Yes, I know.

510
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:55,071
So then Mr Otari, he offered me this job
in his butcher shop and...

511
00:43:55,196 --> 00:43:57,948
Everybody pleaded with me to take it.

512
00:43:58,073 --> 00:44:00,117
So that's what happened.

513
00:44:01,035 --> 00:44:03,079
I didn't wanna be a butcher.

514
00:44:04,372 --> 00:44:07,209
There's nothing wrong
with being a butcher.

515
00:44:08,876 --> 00:44:11,797
Well, it's not an elegant profession.

516
00:44:11,922 --> 00:44:15,884
It's in the lower social scale.
People look down on butchers.

517
00:44:16,009 --> 00:44:18,053
I don't.

518
00:44:20,514 --> 00:44:25,061
Well, the point is Mr Otari
wants to sell his shop now because...

519
00:44:25,186 --> 00:44:30,107
It's a nice little shop. I handle his books

520
00:44:30,232 --> 00:44:32,694
which is not unreasonable.

521
00:44:33,986 --> 00:44:38,074
Takes home net
maybe $100, $150 a week.

522
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:41,494
Point is, of course, you gotta
worry about the supermarkets.

523
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:47,000
There's two in the neighbourhood and an
A&P comin' in, at least that's the rumour.

524
00:44:47,126 --> 00:44:52,131
Marty, it's my feeling that
you really want to buy this shop.

525
00:44:53,465 --> 00:44:55,592
Well, that's true. I do.

526
00:44:55,717 --> 00:44:59,973
But it means I gotta take a loan
out in a bank of $8,000.

527
00:45:00,098 --> 00:45:02,142
That's a big note to carry.

528
00:45:03,977 --> 00:45:10,608
Marty, I've known you for three hours,
but I know you're a good butcher.

529
00:45:11,693 --> 00:45:15,863
You're an intelligent,
decent, sensitive man,

530
00:45:15,989 --> 00:45:20,494
and... well, I have a feeling about you.

531
00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:26,458
Like, well, like sometimes one of my kids
comes to see me about something,

532
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:29,753
and some of these kids, Marty,
in my classes, they...

533
00:45:29,878 --> 00:45:34,008
they have so much warmth
and so much capacity.

534
00:45:36,427 --> 00:45:40,724
Well, that's the feeling I have about you.

535
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:45,102
If you were one of my students,
I'd say to you

536
00:45:45,227 --> 00:45:49,858
"Go ahead and buy the butcher shop.
You're a good butcher."

537
00:45:57,366 --> 00:46:00,995
Well, there's lots of things
I could do with this shop.

538
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,622
I could organise my own supermarket.

539
00:46:03,747 --> 00:46:06,959
Get a bunch of neighbourhood
merchants together.

540
00:46:07,085 --> 00:46:09,712
That's what a lot of them are doin'.

541
00:46:12,131 --> 00:46:13,966
What do you think?

542
00:46:14,091 --> 00:46:17,554
I think anything you wanna do
you'll do well.

543
00:46:19,514 --> 00:46:21,849
I'm Catholic. Are you Catholic?

544
00:46:25,103 --> 00:46:27,147
Yes, I am.

545
00:46:31,151 --> 00:46:36,865
Look, I only got about $3 on me now, but
I only live about eight blocks from here.

546
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:41,495
Why don't we go back to my house, I'll get
some dough and we can go somewhere?

547
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,330
I... I really should get home.

548
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:46,376
It's only a quarter of 12.
The clock's right up there.

549
00:46:47,043 --> 00:46:50,171
I... I really should get home.
I told my father...

550
00:46:52,632 --> 00:46:55,552
Well, I... I suppose a little while longer...

551
00:46:56,886 --> 00:47:01,475
Do you suppose there's someplace
around here I could put on some makeup?

552
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,104
Oh. Hey, Mac!
You got a ladies' room around here?

553
00:47:05,229 --> 00:47:07,273
- In the back.
- In the back.

554
00:48:14,676 --> 00:48:17,763
- She told me, at the risk of her life.
- She always had thin hips.

555
00:48:17,889 --> 00:48:22,560
She told me the doctor told her, if she had
more babies, it'd be at the risk of her life.

556
00:48:22,685 --> 00:48:25,313
When she told me that,
she already had six!

557
00:48:25,438 --> 00:48:29,651
Every time I saw her, she was either
goin' to the hospital or comin' from it.

558
00:48:29,776 --> 00:48:33,446
- She was hatchin' 'em out like eggs.
- Her husband's a skinny fella.

559
00:48:33,571 --> 00:48:38,076
Well, I bumped into her on the street
and she was as big as a barrel.

560
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:40,454
- I said to her "Mary..."
- Lou, seen Marty?

561
00:48:40,579 --> 00:48:43,915
- No, I ain't seen him all night.
- Where's everybody?

562
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,794
"Didn't you say if you
had another it'd kill you?"

563
00:48:46,919 --> 00:48:48,921
And her husband's a little bit of a man.

564
00:48:49,046 --> 00:48:53,426
Well, last week on Tuesday she gave birth
to her baby in St Elizabeth's Hospital.

565
00:48:53,551 --> 00:48:58,431
- A fine, healthy boy. Nine pounds.
- That's fine. So the doctor was wrong.

566
00:48:58,556 --> 00:49:01,184
Oh, no. She died
right there in the hospital.

567
00:49:01,309 --> 00:49:04,395
Oh, that's a sad story.

568
00:49:05,063 --> 00:49:08,692
- And her husband's that little fella?
- That's the one.

569
00:49:08,817 --> 00:49:11,069
That's a sad story.

570
00:49:34,469 --> 00:49:38,848
...moving out to Port Chester.
It's silly to think of commuting.

571
00:49:38,973 --> 00:49:44,021
I'd have to take the subway down to
125th, then take the bus to the railroad,

572
00:49:44,146 --> 00:49:47,607
and then take the New York, New Haven
and Hartford out to Port Chester.

573
00:49:47,732 --> 00:49:51,486
Then I think I have a 20-minute bus ride
out of Port Chester.

574
00:49:52,404 --> 00:49:56,409
Somebody suggested that I buy a car,
but I'm terrified of cars.

575
00:49:57,243 --> 00:49:59,620
I'm always afraid I'll kill someone.

576
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:05,459
Of course, it is a fine opportunity for me.

577
00:50:05,584 --> 00:50:09,547
I could never hope to be the head of a
department in the New York City system,

578
00:50:09,672 --> 00:50:12,508
especially not in the science courses.

579
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:17,389
Of course, I'm not sure
I want to be a department head.

580
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,976
It's mostly executive
and administrative work.

581
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,145
On the other hand...

582
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:28,401
Well, anyway I told you about my father

583
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:31,028
and, well, he depends on me a great deal.

584
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:35,575
Well, let me tell ya, Clara.
I think you're kiddin' yourself.

585
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,411
I mean, I used to think about
leavin' home, you know.

586
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:41,289
And that's what I used to say:
"My mother needs me."

587
00:50:41,414 --> 00:50:45,460
But when you really come down to it,
that ain't it at all.

588
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:50,173
We're just afraid to go out on our own. It's
a big step when you go out on your own.

589
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:54,344
And I think you're kiddin' yourself
when you say your father needs you.

590
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:57,514
Actually, you need your father.
You know what I mean?

591
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,475
Well, you know what I mean.

592
00:50:59,808 --> 00:51:03,437
You're livin' at home now and
you've got your father and mother there.

593
00:51:03,562 --> 00:51:06,649
You could go on like that,
be a little girl all your life.

594
00:51:06,774 --> 00:51:09,110
I'm afraid of being lonely.

595
00:51:09,235 --> 00:51:12,989
You won't be so lonely.
You'll make friends right away.

596
00:51:13,114 --> 00:51:17,953
Well, actually, I don't make friends easily.

597
00:51:18,078 --> 00:51:21,164
What are you talkin' about?
You're a real likeable person.

598
00:51:21,289 --> 00:51:24,210
You'll make friends
in Port Chester one-two-three.

599
00:51:24,335 --> 00:51:27,505
You'll have people visitin' you
all the time. I'll visit you.

600
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:32,551
I'll get my brother Freddie's car
or you can call me up when you feel blue.

601
00:51:32,676 --> 00:51:34,970
Or I'll call you up and...

602
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:38,390
It'll be real nice. Don't be so afraid.

603
00:51:46,357 --> 00:51:48,235
Hey, Marty!

604
00:51:48,401 --> 00:51:51,655
Hey, Marty! Hey, over here!

605
00:51:52,614 --> 00:51:55,742
- Hello, Ralph.
- Hey, Marty. Come over here a minute.

606
00:51:57,328 --> 00:51:59,538
- Excuse me a minute.
- Sure.

607
00:52:02,165 --> 00:52:04,668
- You'll like this guy. He's nice.
- Who? Marty?

608
00:52:04,793 --> 00:52:08,172
- Yeah.
- Oh, this guy's a nice guy, this guy.

609
00:52:08,297 --> 00:52:10,799
- Hi, Ralph. Hello, Leo.
- Hiya, Marty.

610
00:52:10,924 --> 00:52:13,052
Hey, Marty, come here a minute.

611
00:52:13,177 --> 00:52:16,597
Hey, Marty, we got an odd squirrel.
You interested?

612
00:52:16,722 --> 00:52:18,809
What do you mean, Ralph?

613
00:52:18,934 --> 00:52:22,436
Hey, Louise, meet Marty Piletti.
Marty, that's Louise Kelly.

614
00:52:22,563 --> 00:52:26,441
- Hiya.
- We just gonna sit around here all night?

615
00:52:26,566 --> 00:52:30,695
Listen, Marty,
these three squirrels are nurses.

616
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,448
Money in the bank, man.

617
00:52:33,573 --> 00:52:37,327
All goin' over to Leo's house later
because there's nobody there.

618
00:52:37,452 --> 00:52:39,747
These are the girls I told you about.

619
00:52:40,665 --> 00:52:44,460
Wanna get in the car?
She's a pretty nice-lookin' doll.

620
00:52:44,585 --> 00:52:49,799
- I'm with a girl, Ralph.
- Get rid of her. This is money in the bank.

621
00:52:49,924 --> 00:52:54,470
I can't do that, because somebody
already brushed her off once tonight.

622
00:52:54,595 --> 00:52:57,057
This is a good deal here, Marty.

623
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,695
I can't do it, Ralph. Thanks anyway, huh?

624
00:53:11,196 --> 00:53:14,116
- Nice seein' you all.
- Come on, let's get outta here.

625
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:17,453
- Yeah. We might as well get goin'.
- I'll see ya, Leo.

626
00:53:17,578 --> 00:53:19,914
- So long, Ralph.
- So long, Marty.

627
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:01,583
Wait a minute. I'll find the light.

628
00:54:06,922 --> 00:54:09,049
I guess my mother ain't home yet.

629
00:54:09,174 --> 00:54:14,054
My cousin Thomas and Virginia must be
at the movies, so they won't be home yet.

630
00:54:14,179 --> 00:54:17,516
- This is the kitchen.
- Yes, I know.

631
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:19,893
Come on in the dining room.

632
00:54:25,525 --> 00:54:27,569
Sit down.

633
00:54:30,029 --> 00:54:32,407
You want somethin' to eat?
We got chicken.

634
00:54:32,532 --> 00:54:34,993
No, thank you.
I don't think I should stay long.

635
00:54:35,118 --> 00:54:38,204
Oh, sure.
Well, just take off your coat a minute.

636
00:54:52,553 --> 00:54:56,557
I was tellin' you my brother Nicky got
married last Sunday. It was a nice affair.

637
00:54:56,683 --> 00:55:00,519
They had a statue of a woman and there
was whisky spoutin' out of her mouth.

638
00:55:00,644 --> 00:55:05,150
I never saw anything so grand
in all my life. And what a meal!

639
00:55:05,275 --> 00:55:09,112
I'm a butcher, so I know
a pretty good hunk of meat when I see it.

640
00:55:09,237 --> 00:55:12,741
This was choice fillet right off
the top of the chuck. $1.80 a pound.

641
00:55:13,282 --> 00:55:16,203
If you want a cheaper cut of meat,
why, get rib steak.

642
00:55:16,328 --> 00:55:20,332
It's got a lot of waste on it, but it comes
to a buck and a quarter a pound,

643
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:22,502
if it's trimmed.

644
00:55:23,502 --> 00:55:27,589
Listen, Clara... Make yourself comfortable.
You look all tense.

645
00:55:28,466 --> 00:55:30,510
Oh, I'm fine.

646
00:55:32,303 --> 00:55:35,306
You want me to take you home,
I'll take you home.

647
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:39,227
Maybe it would be a good idea.

648
00:55:52,533 --> 00:55:55,411
- No, Marty.
- I like you. I been tellin' you all night I do.

649
00:55:55,536 --> 00:55:57,162
- Marty...
- All I want is a kiss.

650
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:58,831
- Please. Please.
- No, Marty.

651
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:02,085
All right. All right. I'll take you home!

652
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:03,920
All I wanted was a lousy kiss.

653
00:56:04,045 --> 00:56:08,591
Think I'd try somethin' serious with
my mother comin' home any minute?

654
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,930
I just didn't feel like it, that's all.

655
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,124
Well...

656
00:56:42,168 --> 00:56:44,630
I'm old enough to know better.

657
00:56:47,673 --> 00:56:51,427
Come New Year's Eve,
everybody starts arrangin' parties.

658
00:56:53,471 --> 00:56:55,933
I'm the guy they gotta dig up a date for.

659
00:57:01,438 --> 00:57:04,358
I'll just get a pack of cigarettes and take...

660
00:57:12,575 --> 00:57:14,827
I'd like to see you again...

661
00:57:16,037 --> 00:57:18,081
very much.

662
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:24,797
The reason I didn't let you kiss me
was because I just didn't know how to...

663
00:57:24,922 --> 00:57:27,382
handle the situation.

664
00:57:30,218 --> 00:57:32,888
You're the kindest man I ever met.

665
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:40,980
The reason I tell you this is
because I want to see you again...

666
00:57:41,105 --> 00:57:43,149
very much.

667
00:57:45,068 --> 00:57:51,074
I know when you take me home I'm going
to lie on my bed and think about you.

668
00:57:54,744 --> 00:57:57,206
I want very much to see you again.

669
00:58:09,969 --> 00:58:12,596
What are you doin' tomorrow night?

670
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:17,434
Nothing.

671
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:21,022
I'll call you up tomorrow.

672
00:58:23,024 --> 00:58:25,568
Maybe we'll go see a movie.

673
00:58:25,693 --> 00:58:28,155
I'd like that very much.

674
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:35,538
The reason I can't be
more definite now is...

675
00:58:37,455 --> 00:58:41,252
because my Aunt Catherine's
probably comin' over tomorrow.

676
00:58:41,377 --> 00:58:43,421
I may have to help out.

677
00:58:45,047 --> 00:58:47,508
I'll wait for your call.

678
00:58:58,269 --> 00:59:00,730
I better take you home now.

679
00:59:01,856 --> 00:59:05,235
It's gettin' late and the buses
only run about one an hour.

680
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,696
All right.

681
00:59:07,821 --> 00:59:10,032
I'll just get a pack of cigarettes.

682
00:59:44,026 --> 00:59:46,904
What are you doin' New Year's Eve?

683
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:50,574
Nothing.

684
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,514
Hello! Hello! Marty?

685
01:00:16,059 --> 01:00:21,023
- Hello, Marty. When you come home?
- We just got here ten minutes ago, Ma.

686
01:00:21,148 --> 01:00:25,403
Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder.
She's a graduate of New York University.

687
01:00:25,528 --> 01:00:28,365
She teaches chemistry
in Benjamin Franklin High School.

688
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:30,700
Sit down. Sit down.

689
01:00:30,825 --> 01:00:33,536
You want some chicken?
We got chicken in the icebox.

690
01:00:33,661 --> 01:00:37,206
No, thank you, Mrs Piletti.
We were just going. Thank you anyway.

691
01:00:37,331 --> 01:00:41,878
Well, sit down just a minute. I just
come in the house. I take off my coat.

692
01:00:43,338 --> 01:00:49,553
- Did Thomas give you a ride?
- Sure. Is a sad business.

693
01:00:49,678 --> 01:00:53,057
My sister Caterina,
she no get along with her daughter-in-law,

694
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:55,435
so she gonna come live with us.

695
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:59,689
- Oh, she's comin', huh, Ma?
- Sure. Sit down. Sit down.

696
01:00:59,814 --> 01:01:03,484
- Marty, tell her sit down.
- Might as well sit down a minute, Clara.

697
01:01:03,609 --> 01:01:07,905
- You offer young lady some fruit?
- I offered her, but she don't want nothin'.

698
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:10,074
No, thank you, really, Mrs Piletti.

699
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:13,912
Is a very sad business, I tell you.

700
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:18,958
A woman, 56 years old,
all her life she had her own house.

701
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:24,381
Now she's just an old woman
sleeping on her daughter-in-law couch.

702
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:27,593
It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you.

703
01:01:27,718 --> 01:01:32,598
Your children grow up
and then what is left for you to do?

704
01:01:32,723 --> 01:01:35,852
What is a mother's life but her children?

705
01:01:36,227 --> 01:01:41,400
Is a very sad thing when your son
has no place for you in his house.

706
01:01:41,525 --> 01:01:45,153
Well, couldn't she find
some kind of hobby to fill out her time?

707
01:01:45,278 --> 01:01:49,616
Hobby. Hobby. What can she do?
She cook and she clean.

708
01:01:49,741 --> 01:01:54,454
But you gotta have a house to clean
and you gotta have children to cook for.

709
01:01:56,123 --> 01:02:01,044
These are the terrible years for a mother.
The terrible years.

710
01:02:01,503 --> 01:02:04,841
You mustn't feel too harshly
against her daughter-in-law.

711
01:02:04,966 --> 01:02:09,553
She probably also wants to have a house
to clean and children to cook for.

712
01:02:09,928 --> 01:02:16,686
You don't think my sister Caterina
should live in her daughter-in-law house?

713
01:02:16,811 --> 01:02:23,485
Well, I don't know them, but, as a rule, a
mother-in-law shouldn't live with a couple.

714
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:27,072
Where you think
a mother-in-law should go?

715
01:02:27,197 --> 01:02:32,411
I don't think a mother should depend so
much upon her children for her rewards.

716
01:02:32,536 --> 01:02:38,459
Well, that's what they teach you
in... New York University.

717
01:02:38,584 --> 01:02:41,754
In real life it no work out like this.

718
01:02:41,879 --> 01:02:44,131
You wait till you are a mother.

719
01:02:44,256 --> 01:02:48,887
It's silly of me to argue about it.
I... I don't know the people involved.

720
01:02:50,054 --> 01:02:54,726
Ma, I better take her home because
the buses only run about one an hour.

721
01:02:54,851 --> 01:02:55,852
Sure.

722
01:02:55,977 --> 01:02:59,272
Good night. I'm glad to have met you.
I hope I see you again.

723
01:02:59,397 --> 01:03:02,192
OK, Ma. I'll be back
in about an hour, an hour and a half.

724
01:03:02,317 --> 01:03:05,863
- Sure.
- Good night, Mrs Piletti.

725
01:03:05,988 --> 01:03:08,031
Good night.

726
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:17,876
Hey!

727
01:03:18,209 --> 01:03:19,794
Hey!

728
01:03:20,086 --> 01:03:21,921
Hey, Marty! Hey!

729
01:03:22,046 --> 01:03:24,090
Hey, Ange!

730
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:31,265
Marty, where you been?
I been lookin' all over for ya.

731
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,018
I looked all over for you,
but I couldn't find you.

732
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,187
Well, I was lookin' all over for you.

733
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:38,439
We thought we were gonna go for a walk

734
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:41,984
and then we thought we were gonna
come back, but we got to talkin'.

735
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:44,987
I want you to meet Clara.
Clara, my best friend Angie.

736
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:47,532
- I told you about him.
- Yes. How do you do?

737
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,283
Hello.

738
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:55,081
- What we gonna do now?
- I'm taking Clara home. It's close to one.

739
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:58,876
- You want me to ride down with ya?
- What for?

740
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:02,673
- It's early.
- It must be one o'clock.

741
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:05,717
It's Saturday night!
There's still plenty of action around!

742
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:10,263
Listen, by the time I get Clara home
it's gonna be 1.30.

743
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:15,019
By the time I get home it'll be two. I gotta
get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.

744
01:04:16,896 --> 01:04:21,525
- OK. I'll see ya.
- Hey, well, where you goin'? Hey, Ange.

745
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:24,361
Hey, I'll see ya tomorrow after mass, huh?

746
01:04:53,184 --> 01:04:55,228
You got an elevator in this house?

747
01:04:55,353 --> 01:04:57,397
We only live one flight up.

748
01:04:58,314 --> 01:05:00,775
OK. So I'll see you tomorrow.

749
01:05:01,401 --> 01:05:03,027
OK.

750
01:05:03,152 --> 01:05:07,616
Uh, I'll give you a call about 11, 11.30,
as soon as I get out of mass.

751
01:05:07,741 --> 01:05:13,830
Well, better make it around 2.30, because
I won't be home from my aunt's till then.

752
01:05:13,955 --> 01:05:16,124
Oh, OK.

753
01:05:26,052 --> 01:05:28,387
OK. So... I'll see you tomorrow night.

754
01:05:29,681 --> 01:05:31,307
OK.

755
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:35,561
- Good night.
- Good night.

756
01:06:58,566 --> 01:07:00,609
Taxi! Hey, taxi!

757
01:07:01,193 --> 01:07:04,488
Taxi! Hey, taxi!

758
01:07:06,532 --> 01:07:08,367
Hey!

759
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:57,252
Hey, Ma. You know what
I think I'm gonna do?

760
01:07:57,377 --> 01:07:59,921
I think I'm gonna buy Patsy's shop.

761
01:08:13,769 --> 01:08:16,356
You hear what I said, Ma?

762
01:08:16,481 --> 01:08:20,193
This is how I figure. We got
33-odd hundred dollars in the bank,

763
01:08:20,318 --> 01:08:23,739
so I'm gonna have to take it out
to buy the shop. So what do you think?

764
01:08:23,864 --> 01:08:25,281
I don't know.

765
01:08:25,406 --> 01:08:28,369
I'm a good butcher.
I think I'll make out pretty good.

766
01:08:28,494 --> 01:08:31,580
I wanna ask Thomas about this,
but I got my own ideas.

767
01:08:31,705 --> 01:08:33,582
Come on, Marty. It's nine o'clock.

768
01:08:33,707 --> 01:08:38,128
Listen, Ma, you mind comin' home alone
from church because I wanna find Angie?

769
01:08:38,253 --> 01:08:40,839
- I think he's sore at me for somethin'.
- OK.

770
01:08:40,964 --> 01:08:44,968
Ma, what I wanna ask you is, is Thomas
bringing Aunt Catherine here or what,

771
01:08:45,095 --> 01:08:47,264
because I wanna see him?

772
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:51,309
I think Thomas is gonna bring Aunt
Caterina over here, but I don't know.

773
01:08:51,434 --> 01:08:54,563
Now, please go outside
because I gotta put on my clothes.

774
01:08:54,688 --> 01:08:57,774
All right. So what are you
gettin' so sore about?

775
01:09:04,198 --> 01:09:06,783
Marty? Please excuse what I say.

776
01:09:06,908 --> 01:09:08,952
OK, Ma.

777
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:18,379
- Don't you think I feel lousy about it, too?
- I don't wanna talk any more about it.

778
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:22,092
I don't think I got an hour's sleep
the whole night.

779
01:09:22,217 --> 01:09:25,303
Last night was the first time
I ever heard my mother cry.

780
01:09:25,428 --> 01:09:28,306
- Tommy, I...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

781
01:09:28,432 --> 01:09:33,603
I know what you're gonna say. A man's
gotta stop bein' his mother's baby.

782
01:09:33,728 --> 01:09:36,356
She's my mother.
I have some feelin' about her.

783
01:09:36,481 --> 01:09:40,194
- Why am I always made to be the louse?
- I don't wanna talk about it!

784
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:44,615
Look, Tommy... Tommy, I love you
and I know you feel lousy right now,

785
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:48,327
but we'll never be happy unless we have
a chance to work out our own lives.

786
01:09:48,453 --> 01:09:53,792
We can't keep talkin' in whispers the rest
of our lives. We gotta have some privacy.

787
01:09:58,171 --> 01:10:00,966
Ma! Can't you wait five minutes?
I'll drive you over.

788
01:10:01,091 --> 01:10:03,385
- I just gotta put on a shirt.
- Go to mass.

789
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:06,305
I got time to go to mass.
I'll go to 11 o'clock mass.

790
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:08,474
Let me drive you over, will you, Ma?

791
01:10:08,599 --> 01:10:10,643
Thomas, leave me alone.

792
01:10:17,774 --> 01:10:21,403
All right, get dressed because
we're gonna drive my mother over.

793
01:10:21,528 --> 01:10:24,156
Why couldn't you get along with her,
make an effort?

794
01:10:24,282 --> 01:10:27,119
She's hard to get along with.
All I asked you was to try!

795
01:10:27,244 --> 01:10:29,829
- Tommy...
- I don't wanna hear any more about it!

796
01:11:05,408 --> 01:11:07,243
Hello, Aunt Theresa.

797
01:11:07,368 --> 01:11:09,204
Hello, Tommy. How you feel?

798
01:11:09,329 --> 01:11:13,291
Ah, my mother... drives me crazy. I had
to beg her to let me drive her over here.

799
01:11:13,417 --> 01:11:15,961
- Oh.
- She's always gotta be the big martyr.

800
01:11:16,086 --> 01:11:18,339
Please, go to mass, huh?

801
01:11:18,464 --> 01:11:22,760
This one, he wake up this morning
with salt in his nose. Do this! Do that!

802
01:11:22,885 --> 01:11:25,888
Please leave me alone, huh?

803
01:11:26,848 --> 01:11:28,349
- Hello, Thomas.
- Hiya.

804
01:11:28,474 --> 01:11:31,394
Hello, Aunt Catherine.
You gonna go to mass with us?

805
01:11:31,519 --> 01:11:33,563
- I was to mass two hours ago.
- Oh, good.

806
01:11:33,688 --> 01:11:36,482
Make yourself at home.
The refrigerator's loaded.

807
01:11:36,607 --> 01:11:38,985
You go upstairs, take any room
you want, OK?

808
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:41,446
Thomas!

809
01:11:41,571 --> 01:11:44,407
- You want a cup of coffee?
- Ah.

810
01:11:45,366 --> 01:11:48,078
Oh, hi, Virginia.
Oh, you brought him over, huh?

811
01:11:48,203 --> 01:11:50,580
Let me hold him for a minute.

812
01:11:50,705 --> 01:11:56,044
Hey, Petey boy. Yeah.
You're sure gettin' fat. You know that?

813
01:11:56,169 --> 01:11:59,298
Yeah. You're bigger
than a leg o' lamb now.

814
01:11:59,423 --> 01:12:02,385
So, Tom, like I was tellin' you
when you was over here,

815
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:06,806
my boss wants to sell his shop, because
he wants to move out to California.

816
01:12:06,931 --> 01:12:10,060
- What are you so sore about?
- Shut up. Will you do me a favour?

817
01:12:10,185 --> 01:12:13,855
So, Tommy, he does about
$12-1300 gross. The rent's $102.

818
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:17,150
The problem is the supermarkets.
That's what I wanna ask you.

819
01:12:17,275 --> 01:12:19,528
If I get together with other merchants...

820
01:12:19,653 --> 01:12:23,616
What about the time she wanted
to make dinner, but you wouldn't let her?

821
01:12:23,741 --> 01:12:27,536
- Once a month she can't use the kitchen.
- She could use it any time.

822
01:12:27,661 --> 01:12:30,622
- You had to be the boss.
- She wouldn't use my pots and pans.

823
01:12:30,747 --> 01:12:34,419
- Pots and pans, my foot!
- You want me to buy new pots and pans?

824
01:12:34,544 --> 01:12:37,755
Tommy... Tommy...
Look, just give me a coupla minutes.

825
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:41,884
I told Mr Otari I'd let him know tomorrow.
You and Virginia can fight any time.

826
01:12:42,009 --> 01:12:45,388
Listen, I wanna know
about individualised mark-ups.

827
01:12:45,513 --> 01:12:49,058
Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli
is the dairyman and the grocer,

828
01:12:49,184 --> 01:12:51,937
but he works on a...

829
01:12:52,062 --> 01:12:57,317
- Do you know what you're talkin' about?
- No, I don't. That's why I'm askin' you!

830
01:12:57,442 --> 01:12:59,277
Why d'you wanna buy a shop?

831
01:12:59,402 --> 01:13:03,365
You got a good job, no wife,
no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you.

832
01:13:03,490 --> 01:13:06,535
What do you wanna buy a shop for?
Take the baby, will ya?

833
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:11,541
If he wants $5,000 down, you'll have
to carry a mortgage: $60, $70 a month.

834
01:13:11,666 --> 01:13:15,795
You're single with no responsibilities.
Stay that way. Take my advice.

835
01:13:15,921 --> 01:13:18,172
Why are you yellin'? He's askin' advice.

836
01:13:18,297 --> 01:13:21,092
Yeah, Tom, but Patsy's shop
is a specialised trade.

837
01:13:21,217 --> 01:13:25,973
- Supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
- Who buys Italian? Think my wife does?

838
01:13:26,098 --> 01:13:30,560
She goes to the A&P, gets a lamb chop
wrapped in Cellophane, and that's dinner!

839
01:13:30,685 --> 01:13:33,647
- All right.
- I know the problem of the supermarkets,

840
01:13:33,773 --> 01:13:36,817
but I was talkin' to this girl last night...

841
01:13:36,942 --> 01:13:40,196
Look, Marty, will you see
my mother is nice and comfortable?

842
01:13:40,321 --> 01:13:43,700
- Oh, sure. But this girl...
- What girl? What does she know?

843
01:13:43,825 --> 01:13:46,286
Marty, take care of my mother, will ya?

844
01:14:00,217 --> 01:14:03,678
Hey, Ma, get ready,
cos I'll be down in a minute.

845
01:14:03,805 --> 01:14:05,848
- Hey, Caterina.
- Huh?

846
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:12,062
Last night when I come home from
your house, Marty was here with a girl.

847
01:14:12,187 --> 01:14:14,274
- Who?
- Marty.

848
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,816
Your son Marty?

849
01:14:15,941 --> 01:14:19,863
Well, which Marty you think
would be here in this house with a girl?

850
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:23,115
- Were the lights on?
- Oh, sure.

851
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:26,077
This girl is a college graduate.

852
01:14:26,202 --> 01:14:31,792
They're the worst. College girls
are one step from the street, I tell you.

853
01:14:31,917 --> 01:14:36,296
My son Joseph's wife,
you know, she type on a typewriter.

854
01:14:36,421 --> 01:14:38,841
One step from the street.

855
01:14:40,384 --> 01:14:43,638
This is the first time
Marty brang home a girl.

856
01:14:43,763 --> 01:14:48,643
She look like a nice girl. You know,
I think Marty has a feeling for this girl.

857
01:14:49,811 --> 01:14:52,813
You heard him sing?
Sing like that all morning.

858
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:55,858
Well, that's all. You'll see.

859
01:14:56,526 --> 01:15:00,572
Today, tomorrow, in a week,
he's gonna say to you

860
01:15:00,697 --> 01:15:06,370
"Hey, Ma, I'm tired of running around.
It's no good to be a single man."

861
01:15:06,495 --> 01:15:10,624
Then he's gonna say to you "Hey, Ma.
Why we need this old house?"

862
01:15:10,749 --> 01:15:15,421
"Why don't we sell this old house
and move in a nicer part of town?"

863
01:15:15,546 --> 01:15:17,381
"Nice little apartment."

864
01:15:17,506 --> 01:15:19,592
I don't sell this house, I tell you that.

865
01:15:20,468 --> 01:15:24,555
This is my husband's house.
I had six children in this house.

866
01:15:24,681 --> 01:15:26,599
You'll see.

867
01:15:26,725 --> 01:15:31,396
In a couple of months you gonna be
an old lady sleeping on a couch

868
01:15:31,521 --> 01:15:34,942
- in your daughter-in-law's house.
- Ah, Caterina!

869
01:15:35,192 --> 01:15:37,235
Where you go, rain go!

870
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,697
Someday you gonna smile,
we gonna have a big holiday.

871
01:15:40,822 --> 01:15:44,576
Hey, Ma. What do you say, Ma?
It's gettin' a little late, huh?

872
01:15:44,702 --> 01:15:46,537
Sure.

873
01:15:49,122 --> 01:15:54,795
Boy, this place is really comin' to pieces.
Ma, I think we oughta sell this place.

874
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,381
The whole joint's goin' to pieces.

875
01:15:57,506 --> 01:16:02,679
Plumbing's rusty, everything. Now I'm
gonna have to replaster this whole place.

876
01:16:05,182 --> 01:16:07,476
You know what we oughta do, Ma?

877
01:16:07,601 --> 01:16:11,396
Get one of those new apartments
they're buildin' on Southern Boulevard.

878
01:16:11,521 --> 01:16:13,982
A nicer part of town, you know?

879
01:16:17,319 --> 01:16:19,989
- You all set, Ma?
- I'm set.

880
01:16:23,575 --> 01:16:26,287
- Goodbye, Aunt Catherine.
- Goodbye.

881
01:16:49,812 --> 01:16:51,438
We got a couple of minutes yet.

882
01:16:51,563 --> 01:16:53,732
- Hi, Marty.
- Hi.

883
01:16:53,858 --> 01:16:56,027
Ma, fix your coat.

884
01:16:56,152 --> 01:17:01,407
Hey, Marty, we're gonna sit in the back on
account of the baby. See you afterwards.

885
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,120
That was a nice-looking girl
last night, huh?

886
01:17:06,787 --> 01:17:11,250
She wasn't a very good-looking girl,
but she look like a nice girl.

887
01:17:13,169 --> 01:17:16,423
I said she wasn't
a very good-looking girl, not pretty.

888
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:18,926
I heard you, Ma.

889
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:24,015
She look a little bit old for you.
About 35, 40 years old.

890
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,975
She's 29, Ma.

891
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:29,145
She's more than 29 years old.
That's what she tells you.

892
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:32,606
<i>Buongiorno. Che bella giornata.
La messa comincia fra poco.</i>

893
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:35,193
She looked 35, 40 years old.

894
01:17:36,903 --> 01:17:39,239
She don't look like Italian girl.

895
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:44,577
- I say, is she Italian girl?
- I don't know. I don't think so, Ma.

896
01:17:44,703 --> 01:17:47,247
She don't look like Italian to me.

897
01:17:48,457 --> 01:17:50,917
What family she comes from?

898
01:17:52,044 --> 01:17:55,339
I don't know.
Something about her I... I don't like.

899
01:17:56,340 --> 01:18:01,720
It's funny. The first time you meet the girl,
she comes to your empty house alone.

900
01:18:03,889 --> 01:18:07,352
These college girls,
they all one step from the street.

901
01:18:07,477 --> 01:18:10,772
What are you talkin' about?
She's a nice girl.

902
01:18:10,897 --> 01:18:13,358
She don't look Italian to me.

903
01:18:16,611 --> 01:18:20,782
- I don't like her.
- You only met her for two minutes.

904
01:18:20,907 --> 01:18:24,160
- Don't bring her home no more.
- What didn't you like about her?

905
01:18:24,286 --> 01:18:28,749
I don't know. She don't look like Italian
to me. Plenty nice Italian girls around.

906
01:18:28,874 --> 01:18:30,793
Let's not fight about it.

907
01:18:30,918 --> 01:18:34,004
Why are you gettin' so worked up?
I only met her last night.

908
01:18:34,129 --> 01:18:37,007
Probably not gonna
see her again anyhow.

909
01:18:37,133 --> 01:18:39,176
Come on.

910
01:18:51,314 --> 01:18:52,983
- Hello, Lou.
- Hiya, Marty.

911
01:18:53,108 --> 01:18:54,859
- Hi, Ralph.
- Hiya, Marty.

912
01:18:54,984 --> 01:18:57,028
Lou, let me have a Coke, will ya?

913
01:18:58,947 --> 01:19:02,660
Marty, I hear you really got stuck
with a dog last night.

914
01:19:02,785 --> 01:19:07,456
- Who told you that?
- Angie. Said she was scrawny-looking.

915
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:09,625
She wasn't so bad.

916
01:19:10,501 --> 01:19:14,464
- Was Angie here already?
- He was here last night till about two.

917
01:19:14,589 --> 01:19:16,215
Oh.

918
01:19:28,603 --> 01:19:32,482
Hey, Ralph, how'd you make out
with those nurses last night?

919
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:35,069
Oh, Marty. Man, didn't I tell ya?

920
01:19:35,986 --> 01:19:39,240
You know that one that was for you,
the one in the back?

921
01:19:39,365 --> 01:19:43,494
We went over to Leo's house, you know?
So she got loaded drunk.

922
01:19:43,619 --> 01:19:45,704
You should have seen what she was doin'.

923
01:19:45,829 --> 01:19:48,958
Even the people downstairs
started bangin' on the walls.

924
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:52,295
So in the middle of the whole thing
the landlord comes in.

925
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:55,215
These crazy girls
are runnin' around drunk.

926
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:58,051
So we gotta get rid of her
because of the landlord.

927
01:19:58,176 --> 01:20:04,266
So Leo's talkin' to the landlord while we're
tryin' to get this crazy girl out the window.

928
01:20:04,391 --> 01:20:07,519
This crazy girl,
she even left her shoes up there!

929
01:20:14,359 --> 01:20:16,112
So how'd you make out?

930
01:20:16,237 --> 01:20:18,697
- I had a nice time.
- Yeah?

931
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:25,496
Uh, she's a nice girl.
Oh, I didn't try anything.

932
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:33,839
I just met her last night, you know.
She's a nice girl. We just talked.

933
01:20:35,716 --> 01:20:40,096
Uh... uh... We just talked.

934
01:20:48,437 --> 01:20:53,776
Listen, Ralph, if you see Angie, tell him
I went home. I'll see him after lunch, huh?

935
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:08,208
- I wanna talk to you.
- I don't wanna talk right now.

936
01:21:39,866 --> 01:21:43,245
So the whole book winds up...
Marty. Hey, Marty.

937
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:46,915
So the whole book winds up, Mike
Hammer - he's in the room with this doll.

938
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:50,086
So he says "You rat, you're the murderer."

939
01:21:50,211 --> 01:21:53,714
So she begins to con him.
She tells him how she loves him.

940
01:21:53,839 --> 01:21:57,260
Then bam!
He shoots her right in the stomach.

941
01:21:57,385 --> 01:22:01,765
So she's layin' there, gaspin' for breath,
and she says "How could you do that?"

942
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:04,309
He says "It was easy."

943
01:22:05,226 --> 01:22:08,396
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy,
he could write.

944
01:22:08,521 --> 01:22:10,357
I read everything he ever wrote.

945
01:22:10,482 --> 01:22:13,819
Come on! We got a whole pot.
We give you a plate of your own.

946
01:22:13,944 --> 01:22:16,738
I couldn't eat nothin'.
My mother just fed me.

947
01:22:16,863 --> 01:22:21,201
What I like about Mickey Spillane
is he knows how to handle women.

948
01:22:21,327 --> 01:22:25,999
In one book he picks up this tomato. She
was hit by a car and throws a pass at him.

949
01:22:26,124 --> 01:22:29,794
Then he meets two beautiful twins,
and they throw a pass at him.

950
01:22:29,919 --> 01:22:33,423
Then he meets a beautiful society dame,
and she throws a pass at him.

951
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:36,009
That Mickey Spillane,
he could really write.

952
01:22:36,134 --> 01:22:39,763
Anybody wanna go down Van Courtland
Park, watch the ball games?

953
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:42,473
It's only a little bit after two o'clock.

954
01:22:43,808 --> 01:22:47,020
- Where you goin'?
- To call up that girl from last night.

955
01:22:47,146 --> 01:22:50,232
- Thought I'd take her to a movie.
- You kiddin'?

956
01:22:52,484 --> 01:22:55,613
Now, listen, Angie,
you were very impolite last night.

957
01:22:55,738 --> 01:22:58,490
I introduced you to that girl,
you just walked off.

958
01:22:58,615 --> 01:23:01,660
- Why'd you do that?
- It got me mad, that's why.

959
01:23:01,785 --> 01:23:04,456
Hey, Jerry, show Marty
that picture, you know.

960
01:23:04,581 --> 01:23:07,124
Put it away! My mother's out on the porch.

961
01:23:07,249 --> 01:23:10,878
- I wonder where they find those girls.
- They're Hollywood starlets.

962
01:23:11,003 --> 01:23:13,047
Put it away. My mother'll walk in.

963
01:23:13,172 --> 01:23:16,259
Hey, Marty, let's go down
72nd Street area tonight.

964
01:23:16,385 --> 01:23:20,305
I don't feel like goin', Angie.
I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.

965
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:22,849
Boy, you must have
made out good last night.

966
01:23:22,975 --> 01:23:26,520
- We just talked.
- Boy, she must be some talker.

967
01:23:26,645 --> 01:23:29,064
She must have been about 50 years old.

968
01:23:29,189 --> 01:23:33,402
The way I figure, a guy oughta marry
a girl 20 years younger than he is,

969
01:23:33,527 --> 01:23:37,240
so that when he's 40
she's still a real pretty doll of 21.

970
01:23:37,365 --> 01:23:40,619
That means he'd have to marry the girl
when she was one year old.

971
01:23:41,035 --> 01:23:43,371
You're right. I never thought of that!

972
01:23:43,496 --> 01:23:47,334
- She wasn't so bad-lookin'.
- She must have kept you in the shadows.

973
01:23:47,459 --> 01:23:51,254
You don't wanna hang around with dogs.
It gives you a bad reputation.

974
01:23:51,379 --> 01:23:54,049
Let's go down to 72nd Street.

975
01:23:54,174 --> 01:23:57,344
I told this dog I'd call her up today,
about 2.30.

976
01:23:57,469 --> 01:23:59,555
Brush her!

977
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,225
You wanna come with me tonight
or go with that dog?

978
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:05,811
- Why you gettin' so sore?
- Cos I looked all over for you last night!

979
01:24:05,936 --> 01:24:10,191
Another book that I read by Mickey
Spillane, I can't remember the name of it,

980
01:24:10,316 --> 01:24:12,819
but he finds this red-headed doll
on the streets

981
01:24:12,944 --> 01:24:16,530
and he gives her some dough
because he feels sorry for her.

982
01:24:16,655 --> 01:24:21,036
Wait a minute. I think that's the same
book I was tellin' you about before.

983
01:24:22,496 --> 01:24:26,750
- You didn't like her at all?
- A nothin'. A real nothin'.

984
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:30,295
You know somethin'.
This Mickey Spillane.

985
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:32,881
Boy, he sure can write.

986
01:25:31,275 --> 01:25:33,779
So, what are you
gonna do tonight, Marty?

987
01:25:34,988 --> 01:25:37,200
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out.

988
01:25:37,325 --> 01:25:39,785
I may just hang around the house and...

989
01:25:45,374 --> 01:25:48,961
Maybe I'll go down and see
what Angie and the boys are doin'.

990
01:25:49,086 --> 01:25:51,130
I'll see ya later, Ma.

991
01:25:56,344 --> 01:25:59,556
<i>We had...
I don't wanna talk like that fella.</i>

992
01:26:01,224 --> 01:26:03,101
<i>We had the extreme privilege...</i>

993
01:26:03,226 --> 01:26:07,022
<i>of having Jackie Gleason
make his TV debut on our show.</i>

994
01:26:07,147 --> 01:26:11,026
<i>So tonight on our anniversary show...</i>

995
01:26:11,151 --> 01:26:13,195
<i>I'm doing it, huh?</i>

996
01:26:15,656 --> 01:26:17,700
<i>Oh, now, leave me alone, will ya?</i>

997
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:22,038
<i>You know, he scares the life out of me.</i>

998
01:26:33,384 --> 01:26:36,386
- What time is it?
- It's about eight o'clock.

999
01:26:36,511 --> 01:26:38,848
You don't feel like goin' to 72nd Street?

1000
01:26:38,973 --> 01:26:42,268
Itll take an hour and an hour back.
The whole evening's gone.

1001
01:26:42,393 --> 01:26:47,273
What's playin' on Fordham Road? There's
a good picture in the Loew's Paradise.

1002
01:26:47,398 --> 01:26:49,608
Feel like workin' up a game of cards?

1003
01:26:49,733 --> 01:26:54,405
Come on, let's go down to 72nd Street.
We'll wind up with somethin'.

1004
01:26:54,530 --> 01:26:58,576
I'll never forgive La Guardia for
cuttin' out burlesque outta New York City.

1005
01:26:58,701 --> 01:27:01,788
There's a burlesque in Union City.
Let's go to Union City.

1006
01:27:01,913 --> 01:27:04,749
You don't even wanna ride
a half-hour on the subway,

1007
01:27:04,874 --> 01:27:07,919
now you wanna go
all the way down to Union City.

1008
01:27:08,044 --> 01:27:12,674
I feel like playin' cards. I saw Richie Rizzo.
That's what he said he felt like doin'.

1009
01:27:12,799 --> 01:27:16,721
I don't feel like playin' cards.
What do you feel like doin', Angie?

1010
01:27:16,846 --> 01:27:20,015
I don't know. What do you feel like doin'?

1011
01:27:20,141 --> 01:27:22,935
I don't know.
George, what are you doin' tonight?

1012
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:26,648
"What are you doin' tonight?"
"I don't know. What are you doin'?"

1013
01:27:26,773 --> 01:27:28,816
The burlesque! Loew's Paradise!

1014
01:27:28,941 --> 01:27:31,987
Miserable and lonely.
Miserable and lonely and stupid.

1015
01:27:32,112 --> 01:27:35,448
What am I, crazy or somethin'?
I got somethin' good here.

1016
01:27:35,573 --> 01:27:38,326
What am I hangin' around
with you guys for?

1017
01:27:38,452 --> 01:27:42,247
Wait a minute, will you?
What's the matter with you?

1018
01:27:42,372 --> 01:27:47,044
You don't like her. My mother don't like
her. She's a dog, and I'm a fat, ugly man.

1019
01:27:47,169 --> 01:27:52,049
Well, all I know is I had a good time last
night. I'm gonna have a good time tonight.

1020
01:27:52,174 --> 01:27:56,845
If we have enough good times together,
I'm gonna beg that girl to marry me.

1021
01:27:56,970 --> 01:28:00,433
If we make a party on New Year's,
I got a date for that party.

1022
01:28:00,558 --> 01:28:02,768
You don't like her, that's too bad!

1023
01:28:15,908 --> 01:28:19,369
Hey, Ange, when are you
gonna get married?

1024
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:21,663
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

1025
01:28:21,789 --> 01:28:24,875
You're 33 years old.
All your kid brothers are married.

1026
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,753
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

1027
01:28:27,878 --> 01:28:30,172
Hello?

1028
01:28:30,297 --> 01:28:31,716
Excuse me, Ange.

1029
01:28:31,841 --> 01:28:33,885
Hello, Clara?

1030
01:28:49,984 --> 01:28:53,531
<i>What happened? What happened?
Hey, Marty! Hey, Marty!</i>

1031
01:28:53,656 --> 01:28:57,785
<i>Hey, Marty, what happened with you?</i>

1032
01:28:57,910 --> 01:29:01,706
<i>Saturday we had a party, a party.</i>

1033
01:29:01,831 --> 01:29:05,751
<i>Frankie and Lou, everybody but you.</i>

1034
01:29:05,876 --> 01:29:09,339
<i>Where was you Thursday?
Hey, Marty! Hey, Marty!</i>

1035
01:29:09,464 --> 01:29:13,300
<i>Hey, Marty, for our bowling game?</i>

1036
01:29:13,427 --> 01:29:17,138
<i>It seems like a year
since we chug-a-lugged the beer.</i>

1037
01:29:17,263 --> 01:29:21,101
<i>Hey, Marty,
you must have a dame, a dame.</i>

1038
01:29:21,226 --> 01:29:24,521
<i>Hey, Marty, you must have a dame.</i>

1039
01:29:24,646 --> 01:29:29,860
<i>Must have a dame!</i>
