1
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:32,950
(Dr. Steinberg)
Ben.

2
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,070
(Ben) There he is.
How're you doin', Chuck?

3
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,803
I can’t decide if
you look better in

4
00:00:37,816 --> 00:00:39,403
person or on those commercials.

5
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,471
Smoke and mirrors, doc.
What can I tell you?

6
00:00:41,484 --> 00:00:44,671
Hey. I got a new dealership. Right
across the bridge.

7
00:00:44,684 --> 00:00:46,404
I cannot keep them on the lot.

8
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:48,338
Nancy was there for
the grand opening, you know.

9
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:51,971
It’s a tradition we’ve had
since, well, since, I guess she

10
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:54,437
was pregnant with Susan,
our, our second dealership.

11
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,470
Wow.

12
00:00:55,483 --> 00:00:58,105
She just shook so
many hands, you know,

13
00:00:58,118 --> 00:00:59,071
after we cut the ribbon?

14
00:00:59,084 --> 00:00:59,937
Uh-huh.

15
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,237
And she sold three cars herself.

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,403
And she asked me for
a commission, right?

17
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,503
I mean, I thought she was
joking. She was serious.

18
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:07,703
So, I paid her. And
you know what she did?

19
00:01:07,716 --> 00:01:11,103
She went out and she
bought me three suits.

20
00:01:11,116 --> 00:01:13,403
Said I should look like a
businessman, not a car dealer.

21
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:16,006
Well, some things
you can’t change.

22
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:17,938
Which reminds me.

23
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:20,638
That lease comes up on your
wheelbarrow, you call me.

24
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:22,071
I’m gonna give you a
ride make you look like

25
00:01:22,084 --> 00:01:24,304
a Madison Avenue doctor, okay?

26
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:25,304
We have to do this.

27
00:01:25,317 --> 00:01:26,603
Lay it on me,
Chuck. Let’s go.

28
00:01:26,616 --> 00:01:27,843
Okay.

29
00:01:36,452 --> 00:01:39,771
Okay. I’ll see you in
a year, chuck, huh? Better yet,

30
00:01:39,784 --> 00:01:42,271
why don’t we get a round of eighteen
in before the summer?

31
00:01:42,284 --> 00:01:47,771
Uh, before that, I think. I,
I don’t love your EKG.

32
00:01:47,784 --> 00:01:49,938
You don’t love it?

33
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:51,837
There’s an irregularity.

34
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,071
Could be serious so we,
we need a better look.

35
00:01:55,084 --> 00:01:58,170
Uh, I’m gonna set you up
for this, uh, diagnostic

36
00:01:58,183 --> 00:02:01,704
sixty-four slice. A new
kind of, uh, CAT Scan.

37
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:05,318
It’ll give us a peek of what’s
really going on in there.

38
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:36,604
(Susan) There he is. Dad!

39
00:04:36,617 --> 00:04:37,737
(Scotty) Hey, Grandpa!

40
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,511
(Susan) Dad!

41
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,770
(Scotty) Grandpa!

42
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:42,470
Dad?

43
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:43,803
Don’t call me that.

44
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:44,470
(Scotty) What?

45
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:45,602
Don’t call me Dad.

46
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:48,436
And you, you don’t
call me Grandpa. Not now.

47
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:49,636
What can I call you?

48
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:51,601
You, you can call me Dad.

49
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:53,070
No.

50
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,470
That’s what I call my Dad.

51
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:58,075
Well, then, I don’t know.
Call me Captain Ben.

52
00:04:58,683 --> 00:04:59,936
Where’s this one?

53
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:02,469
Do, don’t look, don’t look. You’ll
screw things up.

54
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:03,636
The Miami blonde?

55
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:05,436
Yeah, she was checking
me out on my way in.

56
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:07,469
Hey, give me a hug. Maybe
she'll think we’re married.

57
00:05:07,482 --> 00:05:08,668
Yuck. Dad!

58
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:11,370
I told you.
Don’t call me that.

59
00:05:11,383 --> 00:05:14,473
(Ben) Oh, yeah. She’s gonna
be really happy to see me.

60
00:05:17,282 --> 00:05:20,601
<i>(Nancy) (gasps) My favorite
grandson. Hi, sweetie.</i>

61
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:21,802
Mom.

62
00:05:21,815 --> 00:05:24,702
And, you, I can’t believe
you have the time for us.

63
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:26,938
What happened to all the
divorcees on the eastside?

64
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,971
That's not fair, Nance.

65
00:05:27,984 --> 00:05:29,904
No, that’s true. I
left out the widows.

66
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:31,704
Why is it still so
good to see him?

67
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:33,470
Why is it still so
good to see you?

68
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:34,769
Because you're not
married to me anymore.

69
00:05:34,782 --> 00:05:36,370
That’s why. Why don’t
you sit down. Join us?

70
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,202
Uh, maybe I can stay
for a couple of minutes.

71
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:41,635
Benny, you’re too old for her.

72
00:05:41,648 --> 00:05:42,768
I don’t know what
you're talking about.

73
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:45,003
Oh, deny, deny, deny,
all the time, deny.

74
00:05:45,016 --> 00:05:46,036
(waiter) How are you, folks?

75
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:47,203
Great, thank you.

76
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:48,503
May I take your order?

77
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,637
Yeah. Uh, yeah, I’ll have
a, uh, cheeseburger.

78
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,803
Have the turkey burger.

79
00:05:51,816 --> 00:05:53,236
A cheeseburger.

80
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:54,602
Well, it’s just a matter of time
before I get that phone call.

81
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:56,135
You’ve been waiting for that
phone call for thirty years.

82
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,969
All right. I’ll have the chicken
paillard with a little salad.

83
00:05:58,982 --> 00:05:59,902
(waiter) Very good.

84
00:05:59,915 --> 00:06:01,037
(Susan) Uh, tuna
on toast, please.

85
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,937
(waiter) Okay.
Young man?

86
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,103
Uh, grilled cheese, please.

87
00:06:03,116 --> 00:06:04,537
(waiter) Grilled cheese?
Be right back, folks.

88
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,170
(Susan) Oh, dad, I’m gonna take
Scotty to the natural history

89
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:08,736
museum this weekend. Gary
has to work. You wanna come?

90
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:09,436
I can’t.

91
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:10,635
Oooh. Why not?

92
00:06:10,648 --> 00:06:12,169
I’m sorry, Scotty.

93
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:13,569
Oh, you’re gonna love this one.

94
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,768
What?

95
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:16,802
I’m going up to our old
alma mater this weekend.

96
00:06:16,815 --> 00:06:19,303
No. Oh, my gosh. What,
did they finally, uh,

97
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:20,936
convince you to see
the Kalmen Library?

98
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:22,370
No. Jordan and I are
taking her daughter

99
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:23,836
up for her college interview.

100
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:25,436
Doesn’t she have her own father?

101
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:26,536
Well, apparently
he’s got a life.

102
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:28,336
Why can’t she take
the kid herself?

103
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:30,868
Because of my
relationship with the dean.

104
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:33,834
Oh, do you even like
this Jordan person?

105
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:35,536
(Susan) Dad, you’re
a sixty year old man.

106
00:06:35,549 --> 00:06:36,536
I am not.

107
00:06:36,549 --> 00:06:38,636
Almost. And you are
dating a woman

108
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,581
because of her
father’s connections.

109
00:06:44,748 --> 00:06:47,234
(Ben) No, I’m not going
up there alone. I’m not going.

110
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:48,368
(Jordan) You promised.

111
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:50,335
(Ben) I promised to go with you.

112
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:52,403
(Jordan) Well, I’m sick.
I can’t go.

113
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,970
Well... reschedule.

114
00:06:53,983 --> 00:06:56,569
Allyson can’t reschedule
her college interview

115
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,946
just because I have the flu.

116
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:00,768
I told you, you should
have taken the shots.

117
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:01,902
I hate shots.

118
00:07:01,915 --> 00:07:03,102
Now you got the flu.

119
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:04,235
(Allyson) Mom, it’s fine.
I’ll fly up there myself.

120
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:06,336
In fact, I’d prefer that.

121
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:08,104
See that? She doesn’t
want me going with her.

122
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:09,904
I’d cramp her style.

123
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:12,836
That’s exactly why I want an adult up
there with her.

124
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,569
Her style could use
a little cramping.

125
00:07:14,582 --> 00:07:16,703
Otherwise she might
come home pickled.

126
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:19,035
Mom, I stopped getting
drunk in eighth grade.

127
00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:21,435
It doesn’t matter. You’re
not going up there alone.

128
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:24,141
Can I have a moment
with Benjamin, please?

129
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,502
I don’t think this
is a good idea.

130
00:07:34,515 --> 00:07:36,802
Didn’t you retire from thinking?

131
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:39,368
Why, why can’t she
go with her father?

132
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:41,836
He’s in McLaughlin in some
factory or something.

133
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:45,602
Before I forget, I just got the
confirmation e-mailed to me.

134
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:47,102
I printed it out for you.

135
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:48,269
(Ben) So it’s all set.

136
00:07:48,282 --> 00:07:52,568
It is. So, think of this
as a family weekend.

137
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:56,468
First you’ll go to the meeting
my father had arranged for you.

138
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:59,669
Then you’ll take my daughter
on her college interview.

139
00:07:59,682 --> 00:08:02,369
(Ben) This is a hell
of an open point.

140
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:03,835
(Pete) Nice traffic pattern.

141
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:06,002
Nice? It’s outstanding. With my
banking relationships, we’ll be

142
00:08:06,015 --> 00:08:09,368
up and rolling in no time.
And this zip code, it spends.

143
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:12,134
Daughter graduates from high
school, SUV, six airbags.

144
00:08:12,147 --> 00:08:13,500
Son moves into his own house,

145
00:08:13,513 --> 00:08:15,233
little two seater
with a lot of zip.

146
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:16,569
Your, uh, old flagship.

147
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:18,636
It was north of here,
about, uh, twenty five miles.

148
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,970
But the, uh, family name is
good here in the community.

149
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:23,136
Yeah, well, the research
certainly shows that the name is

150
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:26,205
known in the community. But,
uh, the negative numbers.

151
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:34,036
Pete, I paid my fine.
Okay? Full restitution.

152
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:36,969
And you think that’s painful. You
should try it sometime.

153
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:39,169
You know, I’ll sponsor the
little league, football team,

154
00:08:39,182 --> 00:08:42,234
uh, school carwash.
Negatives will disappear.

155
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:45,135
Mr. Kalmen, I’m gonna speak
freely, okay, out of respect.

156
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:47,835
I’m recommending you get the
dealership because the numbers

157
00:08:47,848 --> 00:08:49,769
make sense, because my
first job was in the finance

158
00:08:49,782 --> 00:08:51,736
department at one
of your old places.

159
00:08:51,749 --> 00:08:53,135
I grew up watching your
commercials on TV.

160
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:55,269
"I’m Ben Kalmen, New
York’s finest car dealer."

161
00:08:55,282 --> 00:08:57,401
You know, you probably
inspired me to go into

162
00:08:57,414 --> 00:08:58,568
this business in
the first place.

163
00:08:58,581 --> 00:08:59,867
Pete, I am honored.

164
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,301
But, I, I don’t think my
recommendation’s gonna do any

165
00:09:01,314 --> 00:09:04,001
good. You know, the dealership
development committee’s not in

166
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:06,702
the habit of handing out open
points to people who have caused

167
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:09,169
the kind of public embarrassment
in the industry you have.

168
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,402
You put the recommendation
before the committee,

169
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:13,436
I’ll make sure about it
getting signed off.

170
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:15,301
Okay. Fair enough.

171
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:16,968
All right. Let me show
you the service area now.

172
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:18,401
You’re gonna like this.

173
00:09:18,414 --> 00:09:19,834
(Ben on phone) No, no, I think it
went as well as it could but,

174
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:22,567
but Jordan. Please, you gotta
have your dad talk to the three

175
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,069
guys from Munich. The three
younger guys, you know

176
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:26,601
were, weren’t
there when I had my, uh.

177
00:09:26,614 --> 00:09:28,168
(Jordan) Shall I lay out his
clothes out from him, too?

178
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:30,168
Or do you think
you can handle it?

179
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:33,300
Yes, sir... roger, I got
that, colonel, yeah.

180
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:38,034
(Jordan) Good. Dismissed.
Hey, I like this.

181
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,370
So, uh, about this weekend.

182
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:43,136
Yves? Would you turn the sauna up as
high it’ll go, please?

183
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,336
I wanna sweat this
thing out. Yeah?

184
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:47,502
Uh. Look, I don’t really
think Allyson wants me

185
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:49,002
up there with her, all right?

186
00:09:49,015 --> 00:09:50,835
Oh, yes, she does.

187
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:54,400
Just like my father wants to
squander fifty years of goodwill

188
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:57,569
and connections as well as
his position on a board of

189
00:09:57,582 --> 00:09:59,935
directors just to get an admitted
grifter a new

190
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:01,469
dealership after
he almost tanked

191
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:04,935
an entire company’s reputation.

192
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:07,140
Okay, Boston here I come.

193
00:10:07,748 --> 00:10:10,701
I’d feel a whole lot better if
you would just turn and leave.

194
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:13,044
I can see how bad you want to.

195
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:15,835
Go to Foxes for the
weekend or the Hamptons,

196
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:20,001
you know, wherever.
Stay out of sight.

197
00:10:20,014 --> 00:10:21,834
Come on.

198
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:24,701
That’s what you were
hoping for the whole time.

199
00:10:24,714 --> 00:10:27,701
Just try not to catch anything you
might give to my mother

200
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:30,034
later because I don’t wanna
have to take care of her.

201
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,369
I don’t lie to your mother.

202
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,568
I call bullshit, Ben.

203
00:10:34,581 --> 00:10:36,134
You call what?

204
00:10:36,147 --> 00:10:38,134
That means ask me where I was
for drinks the other night.

205
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:39,600
I thought you said
you don’t drink.

206
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:42,133
I said I don’t get drunk.

207
00:10:42,146 --> 00:10:44,733
Okay. Where were you for
drinks the other night?

208
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:46,233
The bar at the Warwick.

209
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,401
And what night was that?

210
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,701
The night you hope it wasn’t.

211
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:52,035
Cause you were in
the back booth with

212
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:54,468
that Eastern European web special.

213
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:57,268
That was my cousin Eva. She
was in town on business.

214
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:00,100
I don’t know, why didn’t you
just come by and say hello?

215
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:01,967
I was on my way over to.

216
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,803
And that’s when I saw you slip
your hand under her skirt.

217
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:06,868
I thought maybe you
dropped something.

218
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:09,802
But then she started squirming
in such a way I thought,

219
00:11:09,815 --> 00:11:12,871
I don’t think he
dropped anything.

220
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:15,767
So that’s gin.

221
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,634
Yeah?

222
00:11:16,647 --> 00:11:18,435
Means that you won that hand.

223
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:19,734
I don’t play cards.

224
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:22,636
Well, at least you didn’t
sell me out. Thank you.

225
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,336
I’d cheat on her if
she was my girlfriend.

226
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:28,473
Have a good weekend, Ben.

227
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:42,202
Okay. I’m gonna do this for you. Not
for your mother, for you.

228
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:44,201
I know the school.
I know the dean.

229
00:11:44,214 --> 00:11:47,301
I always regretted never going
to Susan’s college interview,

230
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:48,701
I was always too busy.

231
00:11:48,714 --> 00:11:52,733
Hmm. Yeah, momma said you used to
always be on MSNBC and CNN.

232
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:55,635
And that you had dealerships
in every town in Long Island

233
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,268
and New Jersey and Connecticut.

234
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,968
That’s a slight exaggeration.

235
00:11:58,981 --> 00:12:01,767
She also said you fucked
it up six ways to Sunday.

236
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,712
No exaggeration there.

237
00:12:03,946 --> 00:12:06,299
Look, I promise I will
not ruin your weekend.

238
00:12:06,312 --> 00:12:08,334
You know, I’ll give you a tour
of the campus, take you over to

239
00:12:08,347 --> 00:12:09,900
meet the dean, you know,
for your interview.

240
00:12:09,913 --> 00:12:13,234
Smooth things out. Shake hands. And
then I’ll go back and crash

241
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:16,168
at the hotel and you can do whatever
the hell you want to.

242
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:18,534
And this time I
won’t say anything.

243
00:12:18,547 --> 00:12:20,933
And you won’t treat
me like a kid, right?

244
00:12:20,946 --> 00:12:22,646
Well, you’re not a kid, are you?

245
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:35,102
Some guy’s supposed to meet us.

246
00:12:35,115 --> 00:12:36,934
I don’t know where
the hell he is.

247
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:40,034
(Allyson) You know, I thought
you were an involved alumni.

248
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:43,200
(Ben) Alumnus. Just means
I write the big checks.

249
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:45,000
How do you know the
dean of this place?

250
00:12:45,013 --> 00:12:49,268
Uh, he comes visits me, or he
used to. And he’d always leave

251
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:51,600
my office with an endowed chair
in the English Department

252
00:12:51,613 --> 00:12:54,534
or enough funding to break
ground on the library.

253
00:12:54,547 --> 00:12:55,500
And what about now?

254
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:58,134
Courtesy calls
when he’s in town.

255
00:12:58,147 --> 00:12:59,400
That’s nice.

256
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:01,000
Insurance, for when I can
write the big checks again.

257
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,276
Look out!

258
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:08,335
(Irate student) Hey, asshole. Let the
big dog hunt.

259
00:13:08,348 --> 00:13:11,067
Let the big dog hunt.

260
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,267
(Ben) Let the what?

261
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,933
Let the bi... look,
put the frisbee down.

262
00:13:13,946 --> 00:13:15,935
We’re frolfing.
That was my drive.

263
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:21,539
You called me an asshole,
I’m gonna earn it.

264
00:13:28,347 --> 00:13:29,879
Dickwad.

265
00:13:30,746 --> 00:13:32,769
Oh, my god. Ben!

266
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:38,405
Ben!

267
00:13:40,347 --> 00:13:41,434
(Ben) Easy.
Easy, easy.

268
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:42,300
(Allyson)
Ben, stop it.

269
00:13:42,313 --> 00:13:43,471
(Haverford)
Hey, hey, hey!

270
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,836
Stop all this.

271
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,333
Officer.

272
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:53,336
Uh, Ben Kalmen.

273
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:54,668
Uh, here to see dean Gittleson.

274
00:13:54,681 --> 00:13:56,011
I.D.S.

275
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,600
Someone wanna tell me
what happened here?

276
00:13:59,613 --> 00:14:01,334
We had a little
misunderstanding.

277
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:03,404
I’m willing to
forgive it if he is.

278
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:06,100
I’m willing.

279
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:07,132
Good.

280
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:08,736
Get outta here.

281
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:12,168
Not so fast.

282
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:14,234
I wanna know what you’re
doing on my campus.

283
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:16,667
He’s escorting me
for my interview.

284
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,968
She your daughter?

285
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:20,434
He goes out with my mother.

286
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:21,833
He tell you to say that?

287
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:23,641
<i>No. (chuckles)</i>

288
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:25,908
All right,
let’s see it.

289
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,209
Eighteen.

290
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,833
Kalmen.

291
00:14:34,846 --> 00:14:37,166
You’re the donor of the, the
library and all that, right?

292
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:40,133
Support the college
any way I can, officer.

293
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,166
So you’re also the guy that sold
my cousin in Connecticut the

294
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:44,168
leased jeep, turned
out to be financed.

295
00:14:44,181 --> 00:14:46,467
Cost him nine grand
on the backend.

296
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,734
We did have some
unscrupulous agents.

297
00:14:48,747 --> 00:14:51,334
I take full responsibility.

298
00:14:51,347 --> 00:14:54,066
Yeah, well, you do anything else
unscrupulous on my campus,

299
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,366
you’ll take more than the blame.

300
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,537
Yes, sir.

301
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,700
Wow.

302
00:15:02,713 --> 00:15:03,766
Smooth.

303
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:04,968
(Daniel) Mr. Kalmen.

304
00:15:04,981 --> 00:15:06,500
Uh, yes, that’s me.

305
00:15:06,513 --> 00:15:07,633
Hey, I’m, uh, Daniel Cheston.

306
00:15:07,646 --> 00:15:09,466
I’m the vice president
of the student senate.

307
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:10,933
Uh, dean Gittleson
sent me to find you.

308
00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:12,699
Are you, you okay?

309
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:15,940
No, I’m, I’m fine, Cheston.
I couldn’t be better.

310
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:22,067
Hi, Edward, how are you?

311
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,900
<i>Good, good. Rough, (chuckles) uh,
rough morning?</i>

312
00:15:24,913 --> 00:15:27,966
Uh. This is, uh,
Allyson Karsch.

313
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:28,433
Hello, Allyson.

314
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:29,499
Hi.

315
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,033
Allyson has my highest
recommendation.

316
00:15:32,046 --> 00:15:35,701
Oh, well, I can scarcely
imagine a greater endorsement.

317
00:15:35,714 --> 00:15:36,767
Uh-huh.

318
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,068
Here’s what we’re gonna do.

319
00:15:38,081 --> 00:15:40,233
Mr. Cheston has agreed to get
you reacquainted with the

320
00:15:40,246 --> 00:15:43,299
grounds. I thought you might
to see the Kalmen Library.

321
00:15:43,312 --> 00:15:44,833
And then you can
come back and, uh,

322
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:46,566
meet Allyson at freeman hall.

323
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,010
Good. All right.

324
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:50,932
Look, Cheston, you
got anything else

325
00:15:50,945 --> 00:15:53,400
to do besides
show me around, do it.

326
00:15:53,413 --> 00:15:55,067
You don’t wanna see the library?

327
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,834
Why, because my name is on it?

328
00:15:56,847 --> 00:15:57,267
Yeah.

329
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,439
No.

330
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:00,300
You know, you’re
walking kinda funny.

331
00:16:00,313 --> 00:16:01,766
You wanna go to the school
clinic and get it checked out?

332
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:03,865
I don’t do doctors, not anymore.

333
00:16:03,878 --> 00:16:05,632
You wanna at least clean
yourself up a little bit?

334
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:06,542
You can use my room.

335
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,176
Hi.

336
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:21,032
Cheston, you got a girl?

337
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:22,333
Cheston is actually
my last name.

338
00:16:22,346 --> 00:16:23,732
My, my first name is Daniel.

339
00:16:23,745 --> 00:16:25,400
Ah, that’s a shame. There are
a million Daniels in the world.

340
00:16:25,413 --> 00:16:28,167
Anybody can be Daniel.
But you get to be Cheston.

341
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,033
Okay.

342
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:30,067
Anyway, about that girl.

343
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,932
Uh, yeah, I’m kind
of exploring that.

344
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:33,066
Can’t get laid, huh?

345
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:34,266
I didn’t say that.

346
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,098
Everything about you says it.

347
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:37,465
I mean, look at your
side of the room.

348
00:16:37,478 --> 00:16:40,031
Anyone who’s got the time to
put hospital corners on his

349
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:43,200
college bed is not spending
his days the right way.

350
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:44,566
I didn’t even think
I did that today.

351
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,068
You had a girlfriend
in high school, right?

352
00:16:47,081 --> 00:16:48,367
Yeah.

353
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,700
Right. You met her in, what,
uh, Model U.N. Program?

354
00:16:51,713 --> 00:16:54,766
We were assistant directors of
the community outreach service.

355
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,132
Right. Then she went away to college.
She met some junior,

356
00:16:57,145 --> 00:16:59,400
stormed the administration building,
the provost’s office.

357
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:00,667
Yeah, how did you
know he was a junior?

358
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,267
They’re always juniors.
And then you’re stuck trying

359
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,972
to figure out how
you lost, uh...

360
00:17:07,645 --> 00:17:09,265
Laurie.

361
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,177
Diana.

362
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:13,610
Diana.

363
00:17:14,778 --> 00:17:16,712
Let me tell you something.

364
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,609
Out there is nothing
but possibilities.

365
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:31,265
Hey, Cheston.

366
00:17:31,278 --> 00:17:32,107
Come here.

367
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:35,333
What about that one?

368
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,167
Or that one? What’s
wrong with them?

369
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,533
Nothing they’re probably
just not interested.

370
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:42,598
Well, that’s because you don’t
know how to talk to them.

371
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:45,042
Wait we have to get... okay.

372
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:17,132
What the hell did you say?

373
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:18,398
We’re hanging out with ‘em.

374
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:20,998
Tonight? No, I,
I can’t do that.

375
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:23,033
Uh, uh, tonight we’re gonna go
to a party where they’re gonna

376
00:18:23,046 --> 00:18:25,132
be and girls just like them.

377
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:28,233
Cheston, someday
you’re gonna be my age.

378
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:31,439
You do not wanna regret
a night like this.

379
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,107
Hey, hold up.

380
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:43,810
Yeah.

381
00:18:45,478 --> 00:18:47,465
I didn’t say anything.

382
00:18:47,478 --> 00:18:49,341
No, I know.

383
00:18:58,746 --> 00:19:01,598
Only saps really love this shit.

384
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:05,168
Anyway, it’s nice the bench
is still here, you know.

385
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,637
Onward.

386
00:19:09,111 --> 00:19:11,364
(Ted) I’ll take care
of you, don’t worry.

387
00:19:11,377 --> 00:19:12,997
I’ll show you, I’ll
show you the ropes.

388
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,432
(Ben) Sorry we’re late. I
tried to call you on the,

389
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,165
uh, cell phone. Uh,
couldn’t get an answer.

390
00:19:17,178 --> 00:19:19,532
No problem. This is Ted.
He gave the tour.

391
00:19:19,545 --> 00:19:20,732
Ted Loof.

392
00:19:20,745 --> 00:19:22,098
Right.

393
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:23,864
I was telling Allyson she should
come by the house tonight.

394
00:19:23,877 --> 00:19:26,397
We’re having a party, uh,
figured it’d give a good idea of

395
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,531
the social culture we
have here on campus.

396
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:33,033
Oh. Great. Great. That sounds like,
uh, it sounds like fun.

397
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:43,465
<i>(party music)</i>

398
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:45,432
(Daniel) I told you those girls
were not gonna show up here.

399
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:47,500
Well, what does it matter? Huh?

400
00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:49,499
I mean, look, look
at that one, huh?

401
00:19:49,512 --> 00:19:51,499
And, and this one over here. Well,
we’re mixin’, man.

402
00:19:51,512 --> 00:19:52,932
We re, we’re in here mixing.

403
00:19:52,945 --> 00:19:54,932
No. Well, we’re standing by a keg
pouring for, pouring.

404
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:58,298
And I know you wanna be
right over there, don’t you?

405
00:19:58,311 --> 00:19:59,664
(Daniel) No.

406
00:19:59,677 --> 00:20:01,698
(Ben) No, no, no, no, your
eyes are wandering over there.

407
00:20:01,711 --> 00:20:02,930
Go on. Go on over
and talk to her.

408
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,266
No, she...

409
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:06,166
She’s not the kind of person
you'd go up to at a party,

410
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:07,799
all right? She’s serious.
She’s studious.

411
00:20:07,812 --> 00:20:09,899
She’s here, isn’t she? She’s
got a drink in her hand.

412
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:11,266
Yeah, because her
brother is a member of the

413
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,865
house, nobody hooks up with her.

414
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,699
If you’re not gonna go
over there and see her

415
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:17,497
then I’m gonna tell
you a story. Okay.

416
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,097
Now, this is a little
raw, but it’s all true

417
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,565
so I’m gonna have to ask
for your indulgence, okay?

418
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:23,498
All right, granted.

419
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:26,365
My first year,
when I was here

420
00:20:26,378 --> 00:20:28,931
I wasn’t exactly what you’d
call one of the elite.

421
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:30,764
I mean, I never would have
been invited to a place,

422
00:20:30,777 --> 00:20:33,764
uh, like this. Uh, I
actually had a job.

423
00:20:33,777 --> 00:20:35,264
I was working my
way through school.

424
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,331
Yeah, me too.

425
00:20:36,344 --> 00:20:38,366
No, I know. I sa, I
saw your wardrobe.

426
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:41,432
Um, so I wasn’t exactly what
you’d call, uh, an innocent

427
00:20:41,445 --> 00:20:44,031
but I was intimidated by a
lot of what I saw, you know.

428
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:45,464
Especially the girls.

429
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:49,997
So, there was this one girl who
sat in front of me in, uh

430
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:55,366
English Composition. Her name was
Jennifer Angel. Really.

431
00:20:55,379 --> 00:21:00,399
And every day I’d stare at
the back of this girl’s neck.

432
00:21:00,412 --> 00:21:03,398
And once in awhile, you know,
she’d turn her head and I could

433
00:21:03,411 --> 00:21:07,398
see her face. And she
was beautiful, you know.

434
00:21:07,411 --> 00:21:10,931
She was so smart and clean and,
Cheston, I wanted her in the

435
00:21:10,944 --> 00:21:14,532
worst way possible. But I couldn’t
figure it out. I just

436
00:21:14,545 --> 00:21:17,765
couldn’t screw up the courage,
you know, to ask her out.

437
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:20,731
To me, she was like,
uh, an untouchable.

438
00:21:20,744 --> 00:21:22,230
Yeah. Untouchable.

439
00:21:22,243 --> 00:21:23,431
Yeah.

440
00:21:23,444 --> 00:21:26,131
So, anyway, a few days
later, uh, I’m working.

441
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,800
I’m tending bar, you know,
at some college event.

442
00:21:28,813 --> 00:21:32,132
And this prickass member
of the squash team

443
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:34,632
he comes up and he asks me
for a jack because his back is

444
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:36,098
hurting. So I said,
what happened?

445
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:40,597
And he says to me,
Jennifer Angel.

446
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:44,097
I said, how?

447
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,332
And Cheston,

448
00:21:46,345 --> 00:21:50,699
his answer was like a Joe
Frazier left right to the belly.

449
00:21:50,712 --> 00:21:53,332
He says, I’m fucking
her, right, hard.

450
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,631
And she’s begging me to
go harder and harder.

451
00:21:55,644 --> 00:21:57,930
Finally, I’m banging her so
fucking hard my bed breaks and

452
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:59,164
it falls down and I twist my back.

453
00:21:59,177 --> 00:22:00,596
Jesus Christ.

454
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:02,765
So, I mean, I lost my breath,
right there in front of the guy,

455
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:05,165
you know. I blushed and
I’m not the kind of guy

456
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:07,798
that gets embarrassed.
But you know what?

457
00:22:07,811 --> 00:22:11,863
It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

458
00:22:11,876 --> 00:22:14,463
Knowing how she liked it

459
00:22:14,476 --> 00:22:18,863
and that she liked it freed
me up to talk with her.

460
00:22:18,876 --> 00:22:22,436
And the next week it was my
bed that was almost broken.

461
00:22:38,078 --> 00:22:39,432
(Jimmy) We close
in five minutes,

462
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:42,065
so if you want anything,
it’s to go.

463
00:22:42,078 --> 00:22:44,398
Used to be I’d come in
Jimmy Marino’s joint,

464
00:22:44,411 --> 00:22:46,808
I could stay in here all night.

465
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,297
Well, that’s when my
father ran the place.

466
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:55,065
Jimmy senior must have
liked you for some reason.

467
00:22:55,078 --> 00:22:57,497
Some reason could have been
that I saved your ass in

468
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,964
every math class you ever took?

469
00:22:59,977 --> 00:23:03,230
Oh, I seem to remember the
asssaving, but I was doing it.

470
00:23:03,243 --> 00:23:04,663
Maybe not in class.

471
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,763
Yeah, I think
you're right. Yeah.

472
00:23:06,776 --> 00:23:08,130
(Jimmy) Yeah...

473
00:23:08,143 --> 00:23:11,065
you know, I called you when
you got in all that trouble.

474
00:23:11,078 --> 00:23:13,065
But I couldn’t get
past your secretary.

475
00:23:13,078 --> 00:23:14,798
Oh, you know, she
had her orders.

476
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:17,764
But I, I got the message. I
appreciated it, Jimmy. I...

477
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:19,563
well, I didn’t expect a
call back. I just, uh,

478
00:23:19,576 --> 00:23:22,129
I just figured I wanted you to know
that I called you.

479
00:23:22,142 --> 00:23:23,697
No, no, I knew. And I hope
that you understand.

480
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,164
No, it’s important that I tell
you this because, uh, there were

481
00:23:27,177 --> 00:23:31,031
a lot of unreturned phone calls
and I’m sorry about that.

482
00:23:31,044 --> 00:23:32,664
If it was anybody I wanted
to see in this town,

483
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,733
it would have been you,
you know, when I was gone.

484
00:23:36,776 --> 00:23:39,196
Yeah, you always said
you’d never come back.

485
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,862
Yeah.

486
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:44,865
And like you always
said, I’d never leave.

487
00:23:44,878 --> 00:23:48,464
Well, you, yeah, you got
the, uh, the place here.

488
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:50,170
Yeah.

489
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:52,900
And now you’re here.

490
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,897
Now I’m here.

491
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,274
Is there something you need?

492
00:24:00,545 --> 00:24:03,477
Can I get a sandwich to stay?

493
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:06,731
The usual?

494
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:08,930
<i>Yeah.</i>

495
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:12,130
Give me the usual after
thirty-five years, yeah.

496
00:24:12,143 --> 00:24:13,463
The usual.

497
00:24:13,476 --> 00:24:17,397
Ok, I gotta do this, but I
gotta make it without hair.

498
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,331
Okay?

499
00:24:18,344 --> 00:24:19,397
Looks good though.

500
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:19,603
Looks good.

501
00:24:30,276 --> 00:24:32,263
(Allyson) You?
Really?

502
00:24:32,276 --> 00:24:34,931
(Ted) Lacrosse has been
my passion lately. And, uh

503
00:24:34,944 --> 00:24:36,597
coach says to me, you know,
I want you to play defense.

504
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,664
(Allyson) Yeah.

505
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:38,730
(Ted) Yeah, so I
told the Lacrosse coach

506
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,596
I played
attack in junior high.

507
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:42,596
I was all county
attack in high school.

508
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:44,595
And there’s no way that
I’m playing defense.

509
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,595
(Allyson) So you’re playing
in the front line now or?

510
00:24:46,608 --> 00:24:48,263
(Ted) No, no, no.
He cut me.

511
00:24:48,276 --> 00:24:49,929
But that’s not the
point of the story.

512
00:24:49,942 --> 00:24:52,131
The point of the story is
that I stood up for myself.

513
00:24:52,144 --> 00:24:54,731
I went after what I wanted.

514
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,596
And, uh, you know,
that’s what I always do.

515
00:24:56,609 --> 00:25:01,263
I see what I want and
I take a run at it.

516
00:25:01,276 --> 00:25:04,329
Are you regaling
her, young man?

517
00:25:04,342 --> 00:25:07,262
It sure sounds like it.
Allyson?

518
00:25:07,275 --> 00:25:10,264
Yeah, you look regaled.

519
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:12,265
Stories of what?

520
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:13,597
Glory.

521
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:18,197
Or its punitive
compatriot, noble failure.

522
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,596
Now, I say punitive
because, you know, and this,

523
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:21,930
this comes from a man

524
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:24,931
who’s failed in
starburst colors.

525
00:25:24,944 --> 00:25:30,596
There is nothing noble in failure.

526
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:32,596
Don’t you agree, Tom?

527
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:33,730
Ted.
Ted.

528
00:25:33,743 --> 00:25:36,263
Ted.

529
00:25:36,276 --> 00:25:39,596
My parents named me after
Theodore Roosevelt and, uh,

530
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:40,896
it was he that said

531
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:42,931
"It’s not the critic that
counts, but the man who fails

532
00:25:42,944 --> 00:25:45,130
while daring greatly."

533
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:46,597
But, yeah, he, he succeeded.

534
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,596
I mean, that’s why we know the
quote and he became president.

535
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:54,595
He bumped up against failure,
but he became a success.

536
00:25:54,608 --> 00:25:57,861
That’s not quite what I gleamed
from your Lacrosse story.

537
00:25:57,874 --> 00:25:59,030
(bartender) Can I
get you anything?

538
00:25:59,043 --> 00:26:00,930
Hi. Can I get a Dewar’s
on the rocks, please?

539
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:02,203
Sure.

540
00:26:06,143 --> 00:26:07,596
I’m gonna go to the bathroom.

541
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:13,595
I’ll be right back.

542
00:26:13,608 --> 00:26:15,730
Well, he, he seemed like one
thing, you know, on campus,

543
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:16,730
turns out he’s something else.

544
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,930
Well he’s not from the city.

545
00:26:18,943 --> 00:26:20,929
I think he’s cute.

546
00:26:20,942 --> 00:26:21,929
Why? You gonna stop me?

547
00:26:21,942 --> 00:26:23,529
No, no. I m not stopping you.

548
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:26,195
You go ahead.
Do whatever you want.

549
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:27,594
You going to report
it in to my mother?

550
00:26:27,607 --> 00:26:31,595
I told you that I
wouldn’t, Allyson.

551
00:26:31,608 --> 00:26:34,931
I don’t even care
what she thinks.

552
00:26:34,944 --> 00:26:37,264
I care what you think.

553
00:26:37,277 --> 00:26:38,970
What do you think?

554
00:26:44,276 --> 00:26:45,595
Well, I think it’s
a waste of time.

555
00:26:45,608 --> 00:26:47,595
I think you’re gonna
put in a lot of effort

556
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:49,930
with very little reward.

557
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:52,263
Well, you, you mean
up in the room?

558
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:54,597
I don’t think I gotta
draw a map for you.

559
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:59,730
I mean, a guy like that with a,
um, girl who looks like you.

560
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,396
He’s gonna go simple.

561
00:27:01,409 --> 00:27:02,396
He’s gonna get up there.

562
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:04,129
He’s gonna go through the process.

563
00:27:04,142 --> 00:27:08,064
And he’s gonna, whrip, you
know, he’s gonna be gone.

564
00:27:08,077 --> 00:27:10,930
And then what are you gonna
get out of the transaction?

565
00:27:10,943 --> 00:27:11,929
Transaction?

566
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:12,929
Uh-huh.

567
00:27:12,942 --> 00:27:14,063
I mean, that’s what
it is, isn’t it?

568
00:27:14,076 --> 00:27:16,195
I mean, I know, I know
what he’s gonna get.

569
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:18,595
But what do you get?

570
00:27:18,608 --> 00:27:19,929
I don’t know.
I need another drink.

571
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:22,262
Shh, shh!

572
00:27:22,275 --> 00:27:23,597
Shit, here he comes.
What do I do?

573
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,730
You’ve got the information.

574
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:28,330
You’ve gotta decide.

575
00:27:28,343 --> 00:27:32,196
What you said about what would
have happened in the room?

576
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:33,995
You know, it’s right.

577
00:27:34,008 --> 00:27:36,528
I would have ended up staring
at the ceiling all night

578
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:39,328
while he slept like a log.

579
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:43,595
At least in New York
I could go home.

580
00:27:43,608 --> 00:27:48,263
Has it always been like that?

581
00:27:48,276 --> 00:27:50,262
Okay.

582
00:27:50,275 --> 00:27:52,529
I’ll say it.

583
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:56,528
My first time, I was fourteen.

584
00:27:56,541 --> 00:28:00,264
And it was, it was okay.

585
00:28:00,277 --> 00:28:02,929
But it wasn’t, like, incredible.

586
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:07,195
You know, it’s never
really incredible.

587
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:09,263
And none of the guys
I’ve been with really know

588
00:28:09,276 --> 00:28:12,063
what they’re
doing, I guess.

589
00:28:12,076 --> 00:28:15,064
Well, why don’t you just tell ‘em?

590
00:28:15,077 --> 00:28:16,530
You really don’t have
to say much, you know.

591
00:28:16,543 --> 00:28:20,196
You just have to kind of
take control of the situation

592
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:22,595
move them the way you
want them to move.

593
00:28:22,608 --> 00:28:26,928
Take their hands and put
them where you want them.

594
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:31,929
And if that doesn’t work, then

595
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:35,930
show them, you know, yourself.

596
00:28:35,943 --> 00:28:38,530
I promise you, they’re
never gonna forget it.

597
00:28:38,543 --> 00:28:40,129
Ya, but it will make
me seem like a whore.

598
00:28:40,142 --> 00:28:41,595
Well, you’re thinking
about it the wrong way.

599
00:28:41,608 --> 00:28:44,594
When you’re with somebody that
you like, don’t you wanna know

600
00:28:44,607 --> 00:28:48,063
what makes them feel good?

601
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:50,129
Well, does my mother
know what to do?

602
00:28:50,142 --> 00:28:51,129
Allyson.

603
00:28:51,142 --> 00:28:53,929
No, come on, tell me.

604
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:56,928
Yes, she knows what to do.

605
00:28:56,941 --> 00:28:57,928
But, um...

606
00:28:57,941 --> 00:29:00,262
but not like the Russian, right?

607
00:29:00,275 --> 00:29:01,861
Well, it’s not her fault, you know.

608
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:03,394
She, she’s older.

609
00:29:03,407 --> 00:29:05,530
And, um, your body changes.

610
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,796
There’s a, uh, a, a thickness when you.

611
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:10,995
Thickness?
She’s stick thin.

612
00:29:11,008 --> 00:29:14,528
No one over forty’s
stick thin, not really.

613
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:17,261
Trust me.

614
00:29:17,274 --> 00:29:22,196
But she can get you off?

615
00:29:22,209 --> 00:29:24,266
Yes, she can get me off.

616
00:29:43,942 --> 00:29:45,262
That’s it!

617
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:46,262
That’s it.

618
00:29:46,275 --> 00:29:47,928
That’s it!

619
00:29:47,941 --> 00:29:49,262
You show me.

620
00:29:49,275 --> 00:29:50,942
Show me.

621
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:16,936
Allyson?

622
00:30:30,608 --> 00:30:32,928
Hello?

623
00:30:32,941 --> 00:30:34,461
Allyson.

624
00:30:34,474 --> 00:30:35,461
That was ahh...

625
00:30:35,474 --> 00:30:36,594
it was fun.

626
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:38,594
We had a fun night.

627
00:30:38,607 --> 00:30:40,593
Thanks for coming
up there with me.

628
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:43,394
I’ll just tell my mother that I
had to go back before you cause

629
00:30:43,407 --> 00:30:44,660
I had some work to catch up on.

630
00:30:44,673 --> 00:30:47,930
Well, when we see each
other back at the apartment.

631
00:30:47,943 --> 00:30:50,330
What, you think I never
cheated with anybody at school

632
00:30:50,343 --> 00:30:53,595
and had to see their
girlfriends? Don’t sweat it.

633
00:30:53,608 --> 00:30:57,394
Don’t worry about
a thing. I’m cool.

634
00:30:57,407 --> 00:30:59,896
You sure you never played cards?

635
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:03,263
(Pete) Well, the
committee has met.

636
00:31:03,276 --> 00:31:04,929
The official vote will be next week.

637
00:31:04,942 --> 00:31:06,262
But I wanted to
give you a head start

638
00:31:06,275 --> 00:31:07,595
on getting the zoning in order.

639
00:31:07,608 --> 00:31:09,196
Yes, ah!

640
00:31:09,209 --> 00:31:10,395
Yes. That’s great, Pete.

641
00:31:10,408 --> 00:31:11,662
That’s really, really great.

642
00:31:11,675 --> 00:31:13,728
Kalmen motors on the uptick.

643
00:31:13,741 --> 00:31:16,394
Yeah. You suddenly had a lot
of friends in the right places.

644
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,461
Well, thank you. Looking forward to
working together, Pete.

645
00:31:18,474 --> 00:31:21,595
As am I. You have found
a heck of a location.

646
00:31:21,608 --> 00:31:24,595
I mean, it needs just the kind
of dealership you propose.

647
00:31:24,608 --> 00:31:25,661
In fact, if they hadn’t approved you

648
00:31:25,674 --> 00:31:27,628
I probably would have
recommended getting

649
00:31:27,641 --> 00:31:29,994
another dealer to open
in that very spot.

650
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:31,394
If you don’t mind,
let me show you, uh...

651
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:32,594
Sure, yeah.

652
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:34,594
How many cars we’re
expecting you to floor plan

653
00:31:34,607 --> 00:31:36,129
into the first couple of months.

654
00:31:36,142 --> 00:31:38,131
It’s Ben Kalmen and we
have a lot of confidence.

655
00:31:47,207 --> 00:31:52,797
So, this is a celebration
all around, isn’t it?

656
00:31:54,607 --> 00:31:56,394
Getting your dealership on track.

657
00:31:56,407 --> 00:31:59,395
Fantastic news.
About Allyson.

658
00:31:59,408 --> 00:32:02,528
I can’t believe you were able to
get the information so quickly.

659
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:05,927
It’s fantastic.
Just fantastic.

660
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,927
Well, the dean, he reached out.

661
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,595
I mean, he telephoned me.

662
00:32:10,608 --> 00:32:13,395
How sweet of you to say that.

663
00:32:13,408 --> 00:32:17,128
I’m sure you did quite
a bit of lobbying.

664
00:32:17,141 --> 00:32:18,594
Really, mom?

665
00:32:18,607 --> 00:32:21,261
You think he had to pull on the
strings that hard to get me in?

666
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:24,461
You know how those things are.

667
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:29,498
You’re a suitable candidate,
but without Ben’s help...

668
00:32:30,608 --> 00:32:33,594
We’re so lucky to have you
in our lives, right, Al?

669
00:32:33,607 --> 00:32:35,937
Sure.

670
00:32:39,606 --> 00:32:41,260
How about an after dinner drink?

671
00:32:41,273 --> 00:32:44,595
Let’s go out on the
terrace. Nice evening.

672
00:32:44,608 --> 00:32:45,995
Allyson, you can have a soda.

673
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:48,195
Or, actually, since you’re
going to be a college girl,

674
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:49,928
a little wine if you like.

675
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:51,262
No, it’s okay.
I’m going out.

676
00:32:51,275 --> 00:32:52,928
I’ll see you later.

677
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:53,928
One drink first.

678
00:32:53,941 --> 00:32:54,940
Allyson, come on.

679
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,929
I’ll get that.

680
00:33:03,075 --> 00:33:05,328
Did you get my messages?

681
00:33:05,341 --> 00:33:06,261
Are you crazy?

682
00:33:06,274 --> 00:33:07,528
It’s so hard to talk here.

683
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:09,327
Yeah.
That’s right.

684
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,593
We can’t talk.

685
00:33:11,606 --> 00:33:12,926
Come on, Ben.

686
00:33:12,939 --> 00:33:14,927
You know what
it was in Boston.

687
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,595
It was, it was a kick.

688
00:33:18,608 --> 00:33:20,128
It was really, really fun.

689
00:33:20,141 --> 00:33:23,328
But, you know, now I can check
two things off my list.

690
00:33:23,341 --> 00:33:25,932
Despite the end of daddy thing.

691
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:28,926
The daddy thing?

692
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:30,026
Yeah.

693
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:32,926
And I didn’t even know
it was on my list.

694
00:33:32,939 --> 00:33:35,062
Or I had a list.

695
00:33:35,075 --> 00:33:37,528
Now I know.

696
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:39,262
Come on.

697
00:33:39,275 --> 00:33:41,262
I thought it was gonna be, you
know, the difference between

698
00:33:41,275 --> 00:33:43,328
you and the guys my age.

699
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:45,261
You wouldn’t go simple, you know.

700
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:46,328
Be all clingy and stuff.

701
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:47,760
I’m not hanging onto
you. I just thought

702
00:33:47,773 --> 00:33:49,860
maybe we’d spend a little
time together, that’s all.

703
00:33:49,873 --> 00:33:51,595
Ben.

704
00:33:51,608 --> 00:33:53,928
You need to
forget about it.

705
00:33:53,941 --> 00:33:56,261
You know, I appreciate the
time you took to make me

706
00:33:56,274 --> 00:33:58,261
up to the school and

707
00:33:58,274 --> 00:34:01,593
and you spoke to the
dean on my behalf.

708
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:04,461
And I appreciate the
advice you gave me.

709
00:34:04,474 --> 00:34:06,127
It’s already worked.

710
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,593
What advice?

711
00:34:07,606 --> 00:34:11,594
Well, you taught me to
ask for what I want.

712
00:34:11,607 --> 00:34:15,927
You know, last guy
I was with, easy.

713
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,527
I just gave him a blow job
first before anything else.

714
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,260
And then another one so he could
last when we finally did it.

715
00:34:23,273 --> 00:34:27,127
And then I got on top of him and
I told him exactly what to do.

716
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,261
And... it was awesome.

717
00:34:30,274 --> 00:34:33,528
Awesome.

718
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:36,260
Hey, you’re making this up.

719
00:34:36,273 --> 00:34:37,327
Why would I make it up?

720
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,260
To put me off. To
put distance between us.

721
00:34:39,273 --> 00:34:40,726
I mean, I use that
trick all the time.

722
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,394
But usually it’s because I
actually care about

723
00:34:42,407 --> 00:34:44,194
someone and I.
Yeah, well, I’m not.

724
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,261
I just said what you told
me to do when you were trying

725
00:34:46,274 --> 00:34:47,393
to get me up to the room.

726
00:34:47,406 --> 00:34:48,260
I wasn’t trying to get
you up to the room.

727
00:34:48,273 --> 00:34:50,327
It happened. I’ve got to go.

728
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,260
Mom, I’m going out.

729
00:34:51,273 --> 00:34:53,592
Allyson.

730
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:55,037
Not yet.

731
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:03,928
Now, I’m a pretty cool customer.

732
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:05,461
You know what I do most nights?

733
00:35:05,474 --> 00:35:07,927
Try to find somebody to take
home and never see ‘em again.

734
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,327
Yeah, most nights
you’re not with her.

735
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,460
That’s beside the point.

736
00:35:12,473 --> 00:35:14,726
I can’t stop replaying
our time together.

737
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:16,928
Not just in the room.

738
00:35:16,941 --> 00:35:20,394
When I was talking to you, um,
listening, we were connecting.

739
00:35:20,407 --> 00:35:21,928
I forgot you were eighteen.

740
00:35:21,941 --> 00:35:24,261
You forgot no. That I...

741
00:35:24,274 --> 00:35:27,593
No, I didn’t.

742
00:35:27,606 --> 00:35:31,193
Everything all right?

743
00:35:31,206 --> 00:35:33,594
No, of course.
Of course.

744
00:35:33,607 --> 00:35:36,127
We slept together, mom.

745
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,260
In Boston.

746
00:35:39,273 --> 00:35:40,593
Yeah.

747
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:42,592
We did.

748
00:35:42,605 --> 00:35:44,936
Isn’t that fantastic?

749
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,393
Oh, dad, you didn’t.

750
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:57,926
Ask me was it worth it.

751
00:35:57,939 --> 00:35:58,926
What?

752
00:35:58,939 --> 00:36:00,260
Just ask me if it was worth it.

753
00:36:00,273 --> 00:36:01,259
No.

754
00:36:01,272 --> 00:36:02,259
Well, it was.

755
00:36:02,272 --> 00:36:03,592
You’re actually gonna gloat about?

756
00:36:03,605 --> 00:36:04,959
I’m not gloating about it.

757
00:36:04,972 --> 00:36:06,727
I’m just stating something,
which is, as I sit here now,

758
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,927
it was worth it.

759
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,528
Suse, it was a night and a half.

760
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:13,527
I mean, the way an eighteen
year old body responds.

761
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,260
(Gary) No.

762
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:15,826
No.

763
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,327
No way, Ben.

764
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,259
You can’t keep dragging
her into this nonsense.

765
00:36:20,272 --> 00:36:21,259
Did we wake you, honey?

766
00:36:21,272 --> 00:36:22,259
I’m sorry.

767
00:36:22,272 --> 00:36:23,795
No. Forget about that.

768
00:36:23,808 --> 00:36:27,127
I can’t have you listen
to this crap anymore.

769
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,593
I told you it was unhealthy.

770
00:36:28,606 --> 00:36:30,027
Your shrink told you
it was unhealthy.

771
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,460
Gary, will you stay out of my
relationship with my daughter?

772
00:36:33,473 --> 00:36:34,526
My wife.

773
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:36,327
Well, I’m both.

774
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,327
Sure.

775
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,460
Now you are.

776
00:36:38,473 --> 00:36:40,594
Because you’re what he has.

777
00:36:40,607 --> 00:36:43,794
But before he blew up his
life, what were you to him?

778
00:36:43,807 --> 00:36:44,794
Gary.

779
00:36:44,807 --> 00:36:46,593
That is a ballsy
thing to say, Gary.

780
00:36:46,606 --> 00:36:50,926
Logical, but bitter
and, uh, a little small.

781
00:36:50,939 --> 00:36:52,926
I would have hoped my daughter
would have been with a bigger,

782
00:36:52,939 --> 00:36:54,972
bigger man.

783
00:36:56,339 --> 00:37:00,527
You know what, Ben?
I take care of her.

784
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,261
I’m here for her, always.

785
00:37:03,274 --> 00:37:04,460
You’re a great provider, Gary.

786
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:07,926
But she and I, we’ve
got something special.

787
00:37:07,939 --> 00:37:11,125
We bleed the same.

788
00:37:11,138 --> 00:37:13,528
Susan, let’s go back to bed.

789
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:15,593
I’ll be in, in a minute.

790
00:37:15,606 --> 00:37:16,936
Honey.

791
00:37:27,272 --> 00:37:30,394
He’s right about a lot
of that stuff, you know.

792
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:31,927
Guys like Gary are
right about everything.

793
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,060
That’s why he’s got clients
bringing him 450 an hour

794
00:37:34,073 --> 00:37:36,060
and partners fast tracking
him and all that crap.

795
00:37:36,073 --> 00:37:40,526
I mean, I, I never said your
husband wasn’t a smart man.

796
00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:46,191
It s, just he, uh,
doesn’t take any risks.

797
00:37:46,204 --> 00:37:47,428
I gotta hand it to him though.

798
00:37:47,441 --> 00:37:49,593
You know, he had the balls
to come at me, you know,

799
00:37:49,606 --> 00:37:50,927
and go toe-to-toe with me.

800
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,927
That took balls.

801
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,927
But he didn’t... stay there.

802
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,593
You didn’t used to talk like this.

803
00:37:56,606 --> 00:37:58,527
Well, you know, I
used to shield you.

804
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,193
Now I don’t bother
shielding anybody anymore.

805
00:38:00,206 --> 00:38:01,259
There’s no point to it.

806
00:38:01,272 --> 00:38:03,326
I learned that when I was in jail.

807
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:05,927
You weren’t in jail.

808
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,926
You paid a fine and settled.

809
00:38:08,939 --> 00:38:11,526
I know. Well, I was
in jail for a night.

810
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,592
And before I made the deal I
used to think about it, a lot.

811
00:38:14,605 --> 00:38:16,926
We can have this
conversation another time.

812
00:38:16,939 --> 00:38:20,925
But you came over this
late for a reason.

813
00:38:20,938 --> 00:38:23,328
Yeah, it’s about my, uh, rent.

814
00:38:23,341 --> 00:38:25,794
Uh, you know how close I am
to getting the dealership

815
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:27,126
and rolling up.

816
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:32,125
It hasn’t happened and my,
uh, income stream is short.

817
00:38:32,138 --> 00:38:36,591
Um... Gary handles the checkbook.

818
00:38:36,604 --> 00:38:39,926
I mean, I handle it,
but he goes over it.

819
00:38:39,939 --> 00:38:41,592
It’s his money.

820
00:38:41,605 --> 00:38:43,935
The money he earns
by not taking risks.

821
00:38:50,938 --> 00:38:56,926
Um... here.

822
00:38:56,939 --> 00:38:59,592
Mom gave this as a gift.

823
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:01,925
Half her commission
on a classic six.

824
00:39:01,938 --> 00:39:04,458
I was gonna cash it tomorrow.

825
00:39:04,471 --> 00:39:07,325
It should cover two months or so.

826
00:39:07,338 --> 00:39:10,591
That’s all I can do.

827
00:39:10,604 --> 00:39:12,936
It won’t be long.

828
00:39:15,406 --> 00:39:19,060
Ben, this is
Pete Hartofilias. BMW.

829
00:39:19,073 --> 00:39:20,260
Uh, no easy way to say this.

830
00:39:20,273 --> 00:39:21,592
You didn’t get the dealership.

831
00:39:21,605 --> 00:39:24,592
Someone, uh, moved the board

832
00:39:24,605 --> 00:39:26,925
to vote seven to zero against you.

833
00:39:26,938 --> 00:39:28,593
Seven to zero.

834
00:39:28,606 --> 00:39:30,206
So, that’s that.

835
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:39,326
So the gal’s three down from the
one who looks like an Eskimo.

836
00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:40,592
Tan bag.

837
00:39:40,605 --> 00:39:44,925
I’m gonna say, uh,
divorced three years.

838
00:39:44,938 --> 00:39:47,260
Kids are with the
dad tonight and, uh,

839
00:39:47,273 --> 00:39:49,592
she’s looking to
play for all its worth.

840
00:39:49,605 --> 00:39:51,925
<i>(Steve) FBI should hire
you out as a profiler.</i>

841
00:39:51,938 --> 00:39:53,259
If they were smart they, they would

842
00:39:53,272 --> 00:39:54,392
but it’s not that difficult.

843
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:56,591
Look, she’s got no wedding ring on.

844
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:59,259
She’s showing her pictures in
her phone to the bartender.

845
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:02,059
By his reaction,
they gotta be of her kids.

846
00:40:02,072 --> 00:40:03,460
This is why I was
so good on the lot.

847
00:40:03,473 --> 00:40:06,260
I know exactly what kind
of car to put her in.

848
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:08,526
And I know what she’s looking for.

849
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,125
I imagine you do.

850
00:40:11,138 --> 00:40:14,991
Listen, Ben, I’ve always
enjoyed our dinners, but

851
00:40:15,004 --> 00:40:18,257
I can’t let you out of here
without turning the conversation

852
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,592
into a different direction.

853
00:40:19,605 --> 00:40:20,925
We will.
We will.

854
00:40:20,938 --> 00:40:23,259
Uh, the lady at
the bar with the tan bag,

855
00:40:23,272 --> 00:40:25,125
can you get two of
whatever she’s drinking

856
00:40:25,138 --> 00:40:26,925
and, uh, tell her I’ll
be over there in just a second.

857
00:40:26,938 --> 00:40:28,025
Yes, Mr. Kalmen.

858
00:40:28,038 --> 00:40:30,391
You’ve been a private
banking client for...

859
00:40:30,404 --> 00:40:32,926
one sec, let me just see this.

860
00:40:43,938 --> 00:40:45,259
Sorry.
Okay.

861
00:40:45,272 --> 00:40:48,925
So I can concentrate now.

862
00:40:48,938 --> 00:40:52,059
The reason institutions like ours

863
00:40:52,072 --> 00:40:54,993
have private banking
clients in the first place

864
00:40:55,006 --> 00:40:58,259
is so that our highest net worth
individuals don’t have to deal

865
00:40:58,272 --> 00:40:59,659
with financial minutia.

866
00:40:59,672 --> 00:41:03,525
You’re kicking me out of the bank.

867
00:41:03,538 --> 00:41:07,258
After all these years.

868
00:41:07,271 --> 00:41:12,059
Must have been why you didn’t
eat your lobster cobb.

869
00:41:12,072 --> 00:41:13,259
Bank usually sends a letter.

870
00:41:13,272 --> 00:41:15,262
I wanted to tell you in person.

871
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:24,124
Well, I’m gonna try
to say this nicely.

872
00:41:24,137 --> 00:41:26,592
Fuck you, Steve.

873
00:41:26,605 --> 00:41:29,259
I don’t expect your sympathy.

874
00:41:29,272 --> 00:41:30,792
But I have earned your faith.

875
00:41:30,805 --> 00:41:35,458
I’ve been successful in business
since I was twenty two years old.

876
00:41:35,471 --> 00:41:37,258
You had my belief.

877
00:41:37,271 --> 00:41:40,391
That’s why when New York’s
honest car dealer decided

878
00:41:40,404 --> 00:41:42,458
to engage in a scam

879
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:46,592
for planting phantom cars to
rip off the manufacturer

880
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:50,191
and got caught, we continued
to keep you and your family

881
00:41:50,204 --> 00:41:53,325
in the bank. Continued
to steer deals your way.

882
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:55,191
I call bullshit.

883
00:41:55,204 --> 00:41:56,190
I’m sorry, you call what?

884
00:41:56,203 --> 00:41:57,590
That’s what they say. Bullshit!

885
00:41:57,603 --> 00:42:00,526
The point is, you pretend to
defend your clients when they’re

886
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:02,125
going through tough times

887
00:42:02,138 --> 00:42:03,925
when in fact you’re just
waiting to write off the debits.

888
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,392
We’re not the ones who changed.

889
00:42:06,405 --> 00:42:08,259
You used to stay up ‘til three
O’clock in the morning

890
00:42:08,272 --> 00:42:10,792
reviewing business
plans and sales reports.

891
00:42:10,805 --> 00:42:13,925
Now you can’t even get through
a meal without jumping up and.

892
00:42:13,938 --> 00:42:16,724
I was yanking you, okay?
I know the lady.

893
00:42:16,737 --> 00:42:18,592
She’s the mother of one of
Scotty’s friends in school.

894
00:42:18,605 --> 00:42:20,459
Carol Salomonde.

895
00:42:20,472 --> 00:42:22,259
I wasn’t planning to
take a roll with her.

896
00:42:22,272 --> 00:42:23,259
I wanted to say hi.

897
00:42:23,272 --> 00:42:25,294
You were yanking me?

898
00:42:29,271 --> 00:42:31,924
Steve, come on.

899
00:42:31,937 --> 00:42:33,926
Just give me a year
to get this together.

900
00:42:38,272 --> 00:42:39,525
This is gonna cripple me.

901
00:42:39,538 --> 00:42:41,258
We have to do this.

902
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:42,737
We’re finished.

903
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:47,991
Jason.

904
00:42:48,004 --> 00:42:48,923
(Jason) Yes, Mr. Kalmen.

905
00:42:48,936 --> 00:42:52,458
Can I get a check, please?

906
00:42:52,471 --> 00:42:53,725
(maître d') About your house account.

907
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:54,991
All right.

908
00:42:55,004 --> 00:42:56,937
He’ll pay for it. It’s
the least he can fucking do.

909
00:43:25,273 --> 00:43:26,592
(Carol) Baby aspirin, huh?

910
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:28,592
Uh-huh.

911
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:34,391
Did you have an incident or
are you, uh, just cautious?

912
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:37,590
Do I seem the cautious type to you?

913
00:43:37,603 --> 00:43:39,924
Not the first word I’d use, no.

914
00:43:39,937 --> 00:43:41,257
Yeah, no, I don’t
really know for sure.

915
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:43,925
<i>Some doctor said he saw
something on an EKG,</i>

916
00:43:43,938 --> 00:43:45,391
he wanted me to get some tests.

917
00:43:45,404 --> 00:43:46,925
What did he see?

918
00:43:46,938 --> 00:43:48,591
I never went there.

919
00:43:48,604 --> 00:43:50,591
God, I couldn’t live like that.

920
00:43:50,604 --> 00:43:51,924
If you were my husband.

921
00:43:51,937 --> 00:43:56,990
No, thank God for
all of us involved.

922
00:43:57,003 --> 00:43:58,592
I mean, what do I
wanna know for anyway?

923
00:43:58,605 --> 00:44:02,924
I just wanted to do the things
I wanted to do and only

924
00:44:02,937 --> 00:44:06,124
the things I wanted to
do until it happens.

925
00:44:06,137 --> 00:44:10,589
Whatever, you know, it is.

926
00:44:10,602 --> 00:44:12,590
You seem to have infected
me with a little bit

927
00:44:12,603 --> 00:44:14,590
of that spirit.

928
00:44:14,603 --> 00:44:16,326
Oh, shit.

929
00:44:16,339 --> 00:44:18,792
How did I even end up
here with the grandfather

930
00:44:18,805 --> 00:44:20,924
of my son’s friend?

931
00:44:20,937 --> 00:44:26,257
Because you’re in your
late thirties, Carol.

932
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:27,923
And if you were in your late twenties

933
00:44:27,936 --> 00:44:30,456
you would have ended up
with a dissatisfied father

934
00:44:30,469 --> 00:44:31,922
of one of your son’s friends.

935
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,590
Who even talks like that?

936
00:44:33,603 --> 00:44:35,524
Everybody. They just say
that shit to themselves.

937
00:44:35,537 --> 00:44:36,591
I let it fly.

938
00:44:36,604 --> 00:44:39,657
And you think that’s a good thing.

939
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:44,990
I think that conversation
is not our long suit.

940
00:44:45,003 --> 00:44:47,589
So maybe you ought
to get dressed.

941
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:49,526
Fine by me.

942
00:44:49,539 --> 00:44:53,258
And I know, for sure, that
you’re not gonna share this

943
00:44:53,271 --> 00:44:55,924
with Susan, right?

944
00:44:55,937 --> 00:45:01,590
Believe me, that is
the last thing I want.

945
00:45:01,603 --> 00:45:02,757
Can you do me a favor?

946
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:05,257
Can you just check on
the time on the clock?

947
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,925
The clock?

948
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:08,925
Yeah, it’s in the,
uh, in the drawer.

949
00:45:08,938 --> 00:45:12,658
I threw it there last night so
the alarm wouldn’t wake us.

950
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:14,590
Isn’t that the idea?

951
00:45:14,603 --> 00:45:16,924
I was drunk, you know,
what do you want?

952
00:45:16,937 --> 00:45:18,590
It’s early.

953
00:45:18,603 --> 00:45:19,923
Well, that’s good.

954
00:45:19,936 --> 00:45:21,589
Yeah, I don’t have to
get the kids ‘til two.

955
00:45:21,602 --> 00:45:24,391
I’ve got another three hours.

956
00:45:24,404 --> 00:45:25,391
It’s eleven?

957
00:45:25,404 --> 00:45:26,590
Thirty.

958
00:45:26,603 --> 00:45:29,591
Oh, shit.

959
00:45:29,604 --> 00:45:31,924
(Gary) Oh, great.

960
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:32,924
(Ben) Hey.

961
00:45:32,937 --> 00:45:36,390
Happy birthday, Scotty.

962
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:38,523
You missed the
party, Captain Ben.

963
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:39,692
I know, buddy.

964
00:45:39,705 --> 00:45:40,792
I, you know, I had a
business meeting came up.

965
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:42,924
But, hey, I’m here now, huh?

966
00:45:42,937 --> 00:45:45,324
Yeah. But the party’s over.

967
00:45:45,337 --> 00:45:47,257
You didn’t get to
sing happy birthday.

968
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:49,123
You didn’t get any cake.

969
00:45:49,136 --> 00:45:50,923
(Gary) Capital work there, Ben.

970
00:45:50,936 --> 00:45:52,790
Every time I lower
the bar of expectation,

971
00:45:52,803 --> 00:45:54,057
you limbo right under it.

972
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:55,123
Thanks, Gare.

973
00:45:55,136 --> 00:45:56,057
You know what?

974
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:57,725
We’ll have an after party party.

975
00:45:57,738 --> 00:46:00,924
It’ll even be better than
your birthday party. I promise.

976
00:46:00,937 --> 00:46:02,257
We will?

977
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:04,257
Definitely.

978
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:05,324
You going back to the apartment?

979
00:46:05,337 --> 00:46:07,589
(Gary) Come on, Scotty.
Let’s go, Susan.

980
00:46:07,602 --> 00:46:08,922
(Scotty) Can he come over?

981
00:46:08,935 --> 00:46:10,022
Please, mom?

982
00:46:10,035 --> 00:46:11,588
No, there’s no room
in the cab, sweetie.

983
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:13,122
Suse, just put the
presents in the trunk.

984
00:46:13,135 --> 00:46:14,924
I can ride there.

985
00:46:14,937 --> 00:46:17,457
If you wanna come,
get yourself there.

986
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:19,937
And you better have a cake
and presents with you.

987
00:46:32,604 --> 00:46:34,590
Yes, all right.

988
00:46:34,603 --> 00:46:37,123
Good job.

989
00:46:37,136 --> 00:46:39,190
Oh, we’re gonna save
that for after dinner.

990
00:46:39,203 --> 00:46:40,257
But it’s my cake.

991
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:41,256
You already had cake.

992
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:42,523
Oh, come on.
It’s his birthday.

993
00:46:42,536 --> 00:46:44,390
Let him have a bite.

994
00:46:44,403 --> 00:46:45,923
At least let me see it, right?

995
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,591
Okay.

996
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:48,924
Prevent defense never works.

997
00:46:48,937 --> 00:46:50,924
No, you keep throwing
those Hail Mary passes.

998
00:46:50,937 --> 00:46:53,590
I mean, that’s a
short term strategy.

999
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:54,757
Nice.
My ball.

1000
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,257
This is, uh, this is
the last quarter, guys.

1001
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:58,923
We just started
on this game. No way.

1002
00:46:58,936 --> 00:47:01,256
How many games have
you already played?

1003
00:47:01,269 --> 00:47:04,257
Well, this is the last
game of the regular season.

1004
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:05,923
But we’re only playing
three minute quarters,

1005
00:47:05,936 --> 00:47:08,325
so we’ll be done really soon.

1006
00:47:08,338 --> 00:47:10,257
Half hour more, you two.
That’s it.

1007
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:12,324
We have to go to your
other grandparents house.

1008
00:47:12,337 --> 00:47:14,589
But I wanna stay with grandpa.

1009
00:47:14,602 --> 00:47:16,589
He said I can call
him that in private.

1010
00:47:16,602 --> 00:47:19,389
Well, daddy’s parents are
expecting us, so we have to go.

1011
00:47:19,402 --> 00:47:21,590
Touchdown!

1012
00:47:21,603 --> 00:47:23,257
Hey, no fair.

1013
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:24,257
I was talking to my mom.

1014
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:26,923
Hey, you snooze,
you lose, buddy.

1015
00:47:26,936 --> 00:47:27,923
I love ya.

1016
00:47:27,936 --> 00:47:28,690
Love you, too.

1017
00:47:28,703 --> 00:47:29,656
Okay.
Happy birthday.

1018
00:47:29,669 --> 00:47:30,855
I’m gonna say goodbye to grandpa.

1019
00:47:30,868 --> 00:47:31,588
You go get ready.

1020
00:47:31,601 --> 00:47:34,256
Okay.

1021
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:36,922
I’m glad we got a
moment here alone.

1022
00:47:36,935 --> 00:47:40,924
I need another small loan from you.

1023
00:47:40,937 --> 00:47:43,590
Oh, you’re out of your mind.

1024
00:47:43,603 --> 00:47:45,257
Gary’s right. You’ve totally lost it.

1025
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:46,457
What?

1026
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:48,390
I’m not gonna give you
anymore money, especially

1027
00:47:48,403 --> 00:47:49,856
not after today’s performance.

1028
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:52,056
Uh, didn’t Scotty have a great time?

1029
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,122
He has a better time
with you than anyone.

1030
00:47:54,135 --> 00:47:54,924
That’s the problem.

1031
00:47:54,937 --> 00:47:56,091
He thinks you’re magic.

1032
00:47:56,104 --> 00:47:57,657
That’s how he should
think of his grandfather.

1033
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,058
No, he should think
of his grandfather as

1034
00:47:59,071 --> 00:48:00,325
consistent and reliable.

1035
00:48:00,338 --> 00:48:01,791
Consistent is boring.

1036
00:48:01,804 --> 00:48:03,257
His other grandparents
are consistent.

1037
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,557
He doesn’t wanna
go to their house.

1038
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:06,123
But when he needs them,
he knows they’ll come running

1039
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:07,389
and that makes him feel safe.

1040
00:48:07,402 --> 00:48:08,589
Oh, that’s illusion and you know it.

1041
00:48:08,602 --> 00:48:10,389
No one can protect anyone.

1042
00:48:10,402 --> 00:48:11,624
Look what happened to me.

1043
00:48:11,637 --> 00:48:13,390
You know, all of my high end
friends I cultivated

1044
00:48:13,403 --> 00:48:15,057
over the years and they
run for the hills.

1045
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:16,690
I’m not gonna go back and
forth with you on this.

1046
00:48:16,703 --> 00:48:19,556
You missed his party. He had a smile
on his face cause

1047
00:48:19,569 --> 00:48:22,089
that’s the kind of kid
he is. But I know him.

1048
00:48:22,102 --> 00:48:24,456
He kept looking at the elevator
every time it opened hoping you

1049
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:25,956
were gonna come walking out.

1050
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,989
Mom and I must have tried
your cell phone six times.

1051
00:48:28,002 --> 00:48:29,590
I’m sorry I missed the party,
my alarm didn’t go off.

1052
00:48:29,603 --> 00:48:31,657
I know you’re sorry. I know. See,
this is what you do.

1053
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:34,623
And you know whose
fault it really is?

1054
00:48:34,636 --> 00:48:38,189
Mine. If this happens
again, that’s it.

1055
00:48:38,202 --> 00:48:40,289
I’m not gonna keep putting him
in a position to get hurt when

1056
00:48:40,302 --> 00:48:42,522
you can totally prevent
it from happening.

1057
00:48:42,535 --> 00:48:44,288
What are you telling me?
You’re not gonna let me see my

1058
00:48:44,301 --> 00:48:47,890
grandson? You see the
way he looks at me?

1059
00:48:47,903 --> 00:48:49,957
Come on, I love that boy.

1060
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:53,163
Either be in his life or don’t.

1061
00:49:07,636 --> 00:49:10,189
(Nancy) Antioxidants.
Good for you.

1062
00:49:10,202 --> 00:49:12,456
(Ben) As important as the
future of my circulatory system

1063
00:49:12,469 --> 00:49:16,156
is, Nance it’s, uh, on the
top of my list right now.

1064
00:49:16,169 --> 00:49:19,691
Truth is, I can’t write you another
check, not now.

1065
00:49:19,704 --> 00:49:20,757
(Nancy) Uh-huh.

1066
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,123
(Ben) I need you to
float me some cash.

1067
00:49:22,136 --> 00:49:25,057
Well, Benny, I’m not gonna
let you starve. You know that.

1068
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:26,356
Well, that’s very thoughtful of you

1069
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:29,556
considering how many
meals I’ve given you,

1070
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:30,989
how much cash has
flown from me to you...

1071
00:49:31,002 --> 00:49:32,956
Oh, stop. No. Come on. You are not
that guy. Don’t do that.

1072
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,588
Yeah, you never even
made me take you to court.

1073
00:49:34,601 --> 00:49:38,091
You put in the years.
What was I gonna do?

1074
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:42,690
Ah, what am I gonna do, huh?

1075
00:49:42,703 --> 00:49:45,323
What everybody else does.
What I did.

1076
00:49:45,336 --> 00:49:47,789
Things change, you move on.

1077
00:49:47,802 --> 00:49:51,755
I mean, who thought I would
be selling real estate?

1078
00:49:51,768 --> 00:49:54,957
And it turns that, uh, I’m
good at it and I love it.

1079
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:58,456
And I love my wine classes
and I love my poker games

1080
00:49:58,469 --> 00:50:01,555
on Wednesday nights with my
friends and I love going

1081
00:50:01,568 --> 00:50:05,956
to see the Mets and the
Rangers and I love my view.

1082
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:07,156
Look at this view.

1083
00:50:07,169 --> 00:50:09,488
Yeah, I know. You got the
best view in the city.

1084
00:50:09,501 --> 00:50:11,790
Absolutely. That’s
why I never sold it.

1085
00:50:11,803 --> 00:50:12,990
Uh-huh.

1086
00:50:13,003 --> 00:50:14,989
What do you mean, uh-huh?

1087
00:50:15,002 --> 00:50:16,722
Oh. I know that look.

1088
00:50:16,735 --> 00:50:19,221
What do you think, I’m holding
a vigil for your return?

1089
00:50:19,234 --> 00:50:22,455
I want everything exactly the
way it was for our reunion?

1090
00:50:22,468 --> 00:50:24,487
No, no, no. You made
that very clear when you

1091
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,723
shacked up with that, uh
mark, the orthodontist.

1092
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:29,690
Look, he was a good guy
and, you know you won’t

1093
00:50:29,703 --> 00:50:31,457
be satisfied ‘til I go into a nunnery.

1094
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:34,424
I just find it interesting that
you never changed the furniture.

1095
00:50:34,437 --> 00:50:37,122
Not a chair, couch, even the cushions.

1096
00:50:37,135 --> 00:50:38,956
Is that couch still comfy?

1097
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:41,288
Most comfortable couch you ever sat on.

1098
00:50:41,301 --> 00:50:43,457
Well, I don’t change things
when they’re still working.

1099
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:44,935
That’s your move.

1100
00:51:27,868 --> 00:51:29,522
So what d I tell you, Pete?

1101
00:51:29,535 --> 00:51:31,754
Is this a kickass location or what?

1102
00:51:31,767 --> 00:51:33,121
(Pete) Ben, hi.

1103
00:51:33,134 --> 00:51:34,523
Hi, Ben Kalmen.

1104
00:51:34,536 --> 00:51:37,922
I know who you are. Ben Kalmen, New
York’s honest car dealer.

1105
00:51:37,935 --> 00:51:39,221
This is Bill Rallye.
It’s his dealership.

1106
00:51:39,234 --> 00:51:40,689
Welcome to Rallye motors.

1107
00:51:40,702 --> 00:51:43,861
Rallye motors. I like that. It’s got
a nice to ring to it, yeah.

1108
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:47,522
Now, Ben, I told you
I love this spot.

1109
00:51:47,535 --> 00:51:49,587
No, look, I’m not here to protest.

1110
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,490
I’m here looking for a job.

1111
00:51:52,503 --> 00:51:53,723
You wanna come work for me?

1112
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:56,256
I can sell the hell
out of any car. Always could.

1113
00:51:56,269 --> 00:51:57,790
There’s no question about that.

1114
00:51:57,803 --> 00:52:00,256
(Pete) Uh, Bill, do you mind
just, uh, stepping away,

1115
00:52:00,269 --> 00:52:01,789
give me a moment with Mr. Kalmen?

1116
00:52:01,802 --> 00:52:02,822
Not at all. My pleasure.

1117
00:52:02,835 --> 00:52:05,355
I’ll catch up with you,
Bill. Thanks.

1118
00:52:05,368 --> 00:52:09,922
Ben, I’m not sure corporate
would even let you buy a car

1119
00:52:09,935 --> 00:52:12,489
from us. You really crapped
the bed on this one. It’s like,

1120
00:52:12,502 --> 00:52:16,356
uh, I’ve never seen anyone turn
friends to enemies so fast.

1121
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:19,056
I mean, understand. I saw the
paperwork. It was prepared.

1122
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:21,754
You were in. I don’t know
what you did exactly.

1123
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:25,057
But, uh, it, th, now
there’s no way. No way.

1124
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:26,889
Pete, come on.

1125
00:52:26,902 --> 00:52:29,889
Come on, Pete, Pete, Pete, come
on. Let me into the house.

1126
00:52:29,902 --> 00:52:34,088
I promise you a really
nice parting gift.

1127
00:52:34,101 --> 00:52:36,334
I can’t do it.

1128
00:53:47,866 --> 00:53:49,020
(Todd) Mr. Kalmen?

1129
00:53:49,033 --> 00:53:50,655
Todd. Hello.

1130
00:53:50,668 --> 00:53:52,388
Mr. Kalmen, you’re
three weeks late.

1131
00:53:52,401 --> 00:53:55,256
You’ve only been here two
months. Now, when I let you move

1132
00:53:55,269 --> 00:53:57,355
in with your questionable
financials, you remember?

1133
00:53:57,368 --> 00:53:58,455
I remember.

1134
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:00,688
You convinced me that
I could trust you.

1135
00:54:00,701 --> 00:54:01,955
You can, Todd.

1136
00:54:01,968 --> 00:54:04,087
Okay, well, then I need a check, okay?

1137
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,455
Or else I have to start
removal proceedings.

1138
00:54:06,468 --> 00:54:09,622
By tomorrow morning my sense
of honor is not gonna allow.

1139
00:54:09,635 --> 00:54:11,621
(Susan) Carol Salomonde. You
had to fuck a friend of mine.

1140
00:54:11,634 --> 00:54:13,921
Someone I see at school
every day. And then mock her

1141
00:54:13,934 --> 00:54:16,287
in the morning, never call
her, never return her calls.

1142
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,988
You had to put me in that
position. You’re priceless, dad.

1143
00:54:19,001 --> 00:54:20,287
Ho, ho, hold on here, hold on.

1144
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,454
I just dropped Scotty at
Sean’s house for a play date.

1145
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:25,088
That’s Carol’s son. When I get there
she stops me and tells me

1146
00:54:25,101 --> 00:54:28,188
the story. Says her nanny’s gonna
bring Sean to the next

1147
00:54:28,201 --> 00:54:30,321
play date because it’s
just too awkward otherwise.

1148
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:31,688
Well, what does she expect?
That I should pin her,

1149
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:33,853
take her to the prom?
Just tell her to grow up.

1150
00:54:33,866 --> 00:54:36,286
It’s not what she expects,
it’s what I expect.

1151
00:54:36,299 --> 00:54:37,852
Expect that I should be
chaste, never have any sex

1152
00:54:37,865 --> 00:54:39,019
now that I divorced your mother?

1153
00:54:39,032 --> 00:54:42,221
I expect you to not fuck my friends.

1154
00:54:42,234 --> 00:54:45,289
Todd, e-e-excuse me.
Uh, maybe?

1155
00:54:45,302 --> 00:54:47,989
All right. Well,
I want it by tomorrow. Okay?

1156
00:54:48,002 --> 00:54:50,388
Cashier’s or certified or you’re gone.

1157
00:54:50,401 --> 00:54:51,721
Okay.

1158
00:54:51,734 --> 00:54:54,325
Pumpkin, come on, come on inside.

1159
00:54:56,067 --> 00:54:57,289
You’re not a kid anymore.

1160
00:54:57,302 --> 00:54:59,288
You have to realize you
can't change your daddy.

1161
00:54:59,301 --> 00:55:00,588
I’m still your child.

1162
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:03,521
It’s time you realized
you’re my father.

1163
00:55:03,534 --> 00:55:06,454
How, what, what do
you want me to do?

1164
00:55:06,467 --> 00:55:09,554
I want you to get some help.

1165
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:12,354
I don’t know. See someone,
maybe try medication.

1166
00:55:12,367 --> 00:55:14,889
Just something to get
your balance back.

1167
00:55:14,902 --> 00:55:16,588
Now, I, I’m not gonna do that.

1168
00:55:16,601 --> 00:55:19,255
Do it for me, dad.

1169
00:55:19,268 --> 00:55:20,754
For Scotty?

1170
00:55:20,767 --> 00:55:23,120
I never complained
about any of it, did i?

1171
00:55:23,133 --> 00:55:25,653
When you left mom, when you
blew up your franchises

1172
00:55:25,666 --> 00:55:28,286
when you spent all your money
trying to stay out of prison?

1173
00:55:28,299 --> 00:55:31,955
I didn’t say anything. You used to be
someone I could look up

1174
00:55:31,968 --> 00:55:34,454
to and now you’re just slutting
around Lexington Avenue.

1175
00:55:34,467 --> 00:55:37,388
I turn on the news, I
see you in handcuffs.

1176
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:39,987
Well, you, as bad as it
may have been for you,

1177
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,920
it was worse for me.

1178
00:55:41,933 --> 00:55:43,520
Come on.

1179
00:55:43,533 --> 00:55:48,188
I mean, what was it? Was it one
thing? What hit the switch?

1180
00:55:48,201 --> 00:55:50,462
Uh, what do you want me to tell you?

1181
00:55:51,634 --> 00:55:53,521
Actually, nothing.

1182
00:55:53,534 --> 00:55:55,320
Don’t tell me anything.

1183
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:56,753
Because you’re just gonna say
whatever you think I need to

1184
00:55:56,766 --> 00:55:58,653
hear and then you’re gonna
do whatever you want anyway.

1185
00:55:58,666 --> 00:56:00,054
Suse, come on, Suse.

1186
00:56:00,067 --> 00:56:02,920
No. If you’re not gonna help
yourself, then just leave me,

1187
00:56:02,933 --> 00:56:05,958
my friends and my family alone.

1188
00:56:07,768 --> 00:56:10,288
I’m sorry to hear that.

1189
00:56:10,301 --> 00:56:13,994
But not sorry enough to
do something about it.

1190
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:19,353
You’re really gonna let us
just walk out of your life?

1191
00:56:19,366 --> 00:56:22,391
Well, you’re making
the choice, not me.

1192
00:56:23,634 --> 00:56:25,255
Fine.

1193
00:56:25,268 --> 00:56:27,555
If that’s the way you
need to hear it

1194
00:56:27,568 --> 00:56:29,688
then, yes, I’m making it.

1195
00:56:29,701 --> 00:56:32,394
Stay away from us.

1196
00:58:03,033 --> 00:58:04,653
Ben.

1197
00:58:04,666 --> 00:58:06,098
Hey, Jimmy.

1198
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,790
Come on in.
Annie’s sleepin’.

1199
00:58:13,499 --> 00:58:15,687
I gotta serve breakfast early
in the morning tomorrow, so...

1200
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,752
No, go, go.

1201
00:58:16,765 --> 00:58:19,688
(Jimmy) You can stay in,
in this playroom.

1202
00:58:19,701 --> 00:58:21,220
It’s got a really good sofa.

1203
00:58:21,233 --> 00:58:25,020
And, uh, there’s some linens
in the closet and pillows.

1204
00:58:25,033 --> 00:58:26,119
Good night.

1205
00:58:26,132 --> 00:58:27,153
(Jimmy) Good night.

1206
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:28,619
Uh, Jimmy, um

1207
00:58:28,632 --> 00:58:30,953
listen, how do you, uh

1208
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:34,194
how are you fixed for help at the deli?

1209
00:58:36,101 --> 00:58:38,066
Really?

1210
00:58:46,266 --> 00:58:48,185
(Ben) I don’t know
how you get any

1211
00:58:48,198 --> 00:58:49,985
work done here with
all these distractions.

1212
00:58:49,998 --> 00:58:53,021
I look and go right
back to what I’m doing.

1213
00:58:53,034 --> 00:58:54,020
Uh-huh.

1214
00:58:54,033 --> 00:58:55,954
You’ve been married
how many years?

1215
00:58:55,967 --> 00:58:57,988
Thirty-four years this April.

1216
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:01,220
And you never once took one of
these girls out for a picnic?

1217
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:03,453
I’m married to Annie.

1218
00:59:03,466 --> 00:59:07,019
I know, you said that.
But not once, not even once?

1219
00:59:07,032 --> 00:59:10,088
It’s not like these girls are
throwing themselves at me.

1220
00:59:10,101 --> 00:59:12,721
These girls are into
economics, micro, macro.

1221
00:59:12,734 --> 00:59:16,020
They are, they don’t know
what 58k a year gives ya.

1222
00:59:16,033 --> 00:59:18,053
They’re looking to find
somebody their own age

1223
00:59:18,066 --> 00:59:20,485
or some rich asshole. No offense.

1224
00:59:20,498 --> 00:59:22,863
Why would I be offended?

1225
00:59:24,999 --> 00:59:26,955
All right. You want me to tell you
why it doesn’t bother me?

1226
00:59:26,968 --> 00:59:28,287
Yeah.

1227
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,587
All right. When my father
gave me this place years ago

1228
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,720
I used to dream about these girls.

1229
00:59:33,733 --> 00:59:37,752
Every night, dreams, all
kinds of dreams about ‘em.

1230
00:59:37,765 --> 00:59:40,819
But then I’d see ‘em coming
back after graduation.

1231
00:59:40,832 --> 00:59:43,118
They’d come to homecomings, ballgames.

1232
00:59:43,131 --> 00:59:46,153
They’d sit at the same
tables, eat the same food.

1233
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:50,520
And I look at them and I notice,
they don’t stay like this.

1234
00:59:50,533 --> 00:59:51,953
None of ‘em.

1235
00:59:51,966 --> 00:59:57,419
They put on years and
pounds and wrinkles.

1236
00:59:57,432 --> 01:00:00,287
And I got one like that at
home. So. And we can talk to

1237
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,958
each other. I know her
and I’ll always know her.

1238
01:00:12,265 --> 01:00:14,652
There you are.
Five, six, seven.

1239
01:00:14,665 --> 01:00:15,585
Cheston.

1240
01:00:15,598 --> 01:00:17,288
Mr. Kalmen. Hey.
Great to see you.

1241
01:00:17,301 --> 01:00:18,321
Nice to see you.

1242
01:00:18,334 --> 01:00:19,921
I heard you were,
uh, working here.

1243
01:00:19,934 --> 01:00:21,421
Uh, I wanted to come
bring you your shirt back.

1244
01:00:21,434 --> 01:00:22,820
Ah. Even washed it.

1245
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:23,354
Yeah.

1246
01:00:23,367 --> 01:00:23,920
Thank you.

1247
01:00:23,933 --> 01:00:24,720
Oh. De nada.

1248
01:00:24,733 --> 01:00:26,453
(Maureen) Oh. De nada?

1249
01:00:26,466 --> 01:00:27,620
Looks like you’re doing fine.

1250
01:00:27,633 --> 01:00:29,186
Yeah, I told you I was a good student.

1251
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:30,485
Hey, uh, this is, uh, Maureen.

1252
01:00:30,498 --> 01:00:31,452
Hey.

1253
01:00:31,465 --> 01:00:32,918
Hello, Maureen. How are you?

1254
01:00:32,931 --> 01:00:33,952
Nice to meet you.

1255
01:00:33,965 --> 01:00:35,120
Nice to meet you.
What would you like?

1256
01:00:35,133 --> 01:00:38,287
Um, can I have a black
and white shake, please?

1257
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,354
You got it.

1258
01:00:39,367 --> 01:00:40,520
Uh, actually, uh, make it dos.

1259
01:00:40,533 --> 01:00:41,320
Dos?

1260
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:42,320
Yeah.

1261
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:44,353
Dos, huh? These
are on the house.

1262
01:00:44,366 --> 01:00:47,019
Hey, uh, Mr. Kalmen, we are
having a, uh, little house party

1263
01:00:47,032 --> 01:00:49,918
on Thursday night. We were wondering
if you, would come.

1264
01:00:49,931 --> 01:00:52,187
You’re having a party? Don’t you have
classes the next day?

1265
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,286
Uh, yeah. So I won’t sleep
late and miss a class?

1266
01:00:55,299 --> 01:00:56,553
That really such a big deal?

1267
01:00:56,566 --> 01:00:59,552
Not if you’re sleeping late
at Maureen s, it’s not.

1268
01:00:59,565 --> 01:01:01,885
I’d love to come.
Yeah, that’d be great.

1269
01:01:01,898 --> 01:01:05,319
Um, mucho gracias por la invitación.

1270
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:07,298
Uh, yeah.

1271
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:11,095
Speaks Spanish.

1272
01:01:39,698 --> 01:01:41,962
(Ben) Okay.
Here you go.

1273
01:01:49,632 --> 01:01:51,154
Ben.

1274
01:01:53,465 --> 01:01:55,022
This is weird.

1275
01:01:56,198 --> 01:01:59,166
I didn’t chase you up here. Okay?

1276
01:02:01,299 --> 01:02:04,353
I don’t, uh,

1277
01:02:04,366 --> 01:02:07,297
I don’t know what to say.

1278
01:02:09,298 --> 01:02:12,584
Well, there’s really
nothing to say, you know.

1279
01:02:12,597 --> 01:02:14,960
This is weird.

1280
01:02:23,232 --> 01:02:24,819
I had to get out of the city.

1281
01:02:24,832 --> 01:02:29,351
Jimmy offered me a job and,
uh, that’s why I’m here.

1282
01:02:29,364 --> 01:02:32,720
And this is the best
job you could get.

1283
01:02:32,733 --> 01:02:35,219
It’s a job.

1284
01:02:35,232 --> 01:02:37,985
You had to have other options.

1285
01:02:37,998 --> 01:02:39,851
Well, your mom was
pretty effective about

1286
01:02:39,864 --> 01:02:41,955
eliminating all of them.

1287
01:02:44,464 --> 01:02:46,651
You must be so mad at me.

1288
01:02:46,664 --> 01:02:51,186
Not really. No. You know, you had an
opening. You took it.

1289
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:54,285
Got a good clean shot in at your mom.

1290
01:02:54,298 --> 01:02:56,991
Boxing glove can’t
get mad at the fist.

1291
01:02:59,864 --> 01:03:01,750
So, you’re okay?

1292
01:03:01,763 --> 01:03:03,922
It’s what it is, yeah.

1293
01:03:37,464 --> 01:03:38,751
(Gary) Hello?

1294
01:03:38,764 --> 01:03:41,653
Gary, I wanna talk to my grandson.

1295
01:03:41,666 --> 01:03:44,019
He went, went to sleep,
like, six hours ago.

1296
01:03:44,032 --> 01:03:45,686
Ben, do you know what time it is?

1297
01:03:45,699 --> 01:03:47,085
I know, I know, it’s late. It’s late.

1298
01:03:47,098 --> 01:03:49,757
Just, just wake, wake him.
He’s gonna wanna talk to me.

1299
01:03:50,464 --> 01:03:52,760
Your father.

1300
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:56,819
Dad, you can’t do this.

1301
01:03:56,832 --> 01:03:58,018
I, I gotta talk to him.

1302
01:03:58,031 --> 01:03:59,785
There’s things I gotta
tell him, Suse, you know.

1303
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:00,852
No.

1304
01:04:00,865 --> 01:04:03,585
I, this is important stuff.

1305
01:04:03,598 --> 01:04:06,885
I’m not gonna be around
here forever, you know.

1306
01:04:06,898 --> 01:04:09,718
And who’s gonna show him?

1307
01:04:09,731 --> 01:04:13,216
This is hard for me, but
I’m hanging up now, dad.

1308
01:04:13,229 --> 01:04:16,018
No, no, no, no, no,
okay. I, I, look. It’s...

1309
01:04:16,031 --> 01:04:21,327
I’m sorry I called late.
Past his bed time, but...

1310
01:04:23,064 --> 01:04:28,650
I’m sitting here on the
bench where I met your mom.

1311
01:04:28,663 --> 01:04:32,720
I gotta pass this fucking bench
three times a day, you know.

1312
01:04:32,733 --> 01:04:35,119
I’m sorry.

1313
01:04:35,132 --> 01:04:38,152
No. I’ll call back in the morning.

1314
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:40,451
He won’t be available then either.

1315
01:04:40,464 --> 01:04:44,151
He thinks you’re on a long trip
where there are no phones.

1316
01:04:44,164 --> 01:04:46,530
Which you are.

1317
01:05:18,597 --> 01:05:19,784
Yeah.

1318
01:05:19,797 --> 01:05:21,219
(Jordan) I’m going
to speak quickly and clearly

1319
01:05:21,232 --> 01:05:23,918
so that we don’t misunderstand
one another, Benjamin.

1320
01:05:23,931 --> 01:05:25,551
That would be fine.

1321
01:05:25,564 --> 01:05:28,351
It has been explained to me that
you are on Allyson’s campus?

1322
01:05:28,364 --> 01:05:32,017
I am at the school.
Yeah. I got a job here.

1323
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:34,650
You are to leave that
campus immediately.

1324
01:05:34,663 --> 01:05:36,816
I will not have my daughter’s
environment threatened. This is

1325
01:05:36,829 --> 01:05:40,318
her college experience. I want her to
remember it fondly.

1326
01:05:40,331 --> 01:05:41,951
Has she complained to you?

1327
01:05:41,964 --> 01:05:45,184
That’s an irrelevant question.

1328
01:05:45,197 --> 01:05:47,650
I’ve never approached her.
Never tried.

1329
01:05:47,663 --> 01:05:50,650
Well, you’re mistaking
this for a conversation.

1330
01:05:50,663 --> 01:05:53,383
I don’t wanna have to tell
Allyson’s father about

1331
01:05:53,396 --> 01:05:56,752
everything that’s transpired,
but I will. And as you know,

1332
01:05:56,765 --> 01:06:00,551
he has a wide ranging group
of contacts and a far reach.

1333
01:06:00,564 --> 01:06:03,151
I’m sure he does.

1334
01:06:03,164 --> 01:06:05,151
Can’t we move on?

1335
01:06:05,164 --> 01:06:06,583
I have moved on.

1336
01:06:06,596 --> 01:06:09,685
The moment you put your hands on
my daughter, you ceased to exist

1337
01:06:09,698 --> 01:06:13,652
to me. It is now as if
you never existed. I believe

1338
01:06:13,665 --> 01:06:17,419
I’ve shown remarkable restraint
in taking this approach.

1339
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:19,284
I take a great measure of
pride in it, actually

1340
01:06:19,297 --> 01:06:21,817
to be able to transcend the
influence of a life form such as

1341
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:24,383
yours. But hear this. It certainly
isn’t the only

1342
01:06:24,396 --> 01:06:27,016
approach available to me. Tomorrow,
Ben, you get going.

1343
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:30,656
Or this file moves from my
desk to Allyson’s father s.

1344
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:44,050
So I’m thinking, yeah, Allyson
was trying to get a rise from

1345
01:06:44,063 --> 01:06:46,584
her mother who was trying to
get my attention to her mother.

1346
01:06:46,597 --> 01:06:47,584
Right.

1347
01:06:47,597 --> 01:06:48,951
You see, see, see what I mean.

1348
01:06:48,964 --> 01:06:50,518
Yeah, yeah, dude. You’re trying to
understand her behavior

1349
01:06:50,531 --> 01:06:52,051
through, through Jungian archetypes.

1350
01:06:52,064 --> 01:06:53,817
That’s, that’s a slippery slope, Ben.

1351
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:56,250
Well, you did some homework
today, didn’t you?

1352
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:58,284
I did do some homework.
Yeah. I still have to do well.

1353
01:06:58,297 --> 01:07:00,483
Don’t worry. I told her
I was, um, crashing out after.

1354
01:07:00,496 --> 01:07:01,684
In the morning, wake me.

1355
01:07:01,697 --> 01:07:03,052
Yeah. Well played, man.
Well played.

1356
01:07:03,065 --> 01:07:04,785
But, anyway, getting
back to Allyson. I think she’s,

1357
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:07,518
she’s trying to give me some kind of
message, you know?

1358
01:07:07,531 --> 01:07:09,884
Yeah. Yeah, I think you,
you got caught up in her.

1359
01:07:09,897 --> 01:07:12,183
I did, yeah.

1360
01:07:12,196 --> 01:07:13,483
Yeah, you did.
Which is interesting, actually.

1361
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:15,349
Because, um, your
counsel to me was, uh.

1362
01:07:15,362 --> 01:07:16,883
I say a whole bunch
of shit, you know.

1363
01:07:16,896 --> 01:07:17,982
Some of it’s even the truth.

1364
01:07:17,995 --> 01:07:19,198
Oh, yeah.

1365
01:07:27,098 --> 01:07:28,217
That’s good.

1366
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:29,084
Yeah?

1367
01:07:29,097 --> 01:07:30,917
Yeah. Is this new?

1368
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:33,450
Um, no. No, it’s old. It’s really,
actually, I think it’s

1369
01:07:33,463 --> 01:07:35,450
from when I was in eleventh grade or
something.

1370
01:07:35,463 --> 01:07:36,352
Hmm. It’s still good though.

1371
01:07:36,365 --> 01:07:37,489
Thank you.

1372
01:07:39,031 --> 01:07:41,584
Well done, huh, young man?
Well done.

1373
01:07:41,597 --> 01:07:42,721
Thank you.

1374
01:07:43,897 --> 01:07:45,750
(Ben) All the way around.

1375
01:07:45,763 --> 01:07:48,083
Yeah, well, getting into an
eclectic house was, was really

1376
01:07:48,096 --> 01:07:50,684
great. But, um, being junior is just really

1377
01:07:50,697 --> 01:07:52,150
different than being a sophomore.

1378
01:07:52,163 --> 01:07:54,551
Yeah. But being a sophomore is a hell
of a lot better than being

1379
01:07:54,564 --> 01:07:58,189
a senior because you’ve
got it all in front of you.

1380
01:08:08,195 --> 01:08:10,051
Lumberjack.

1381
01:08:10,064 --> 01:08:11,217
What?

1382
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:14,084
You’re Sunday breakfast.
Lumberjack special.

1383
01:08:14,097 --> 01:08:17,217
The two, the two, the two.
The cakes, the eggs, bacon.

1384
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:19,117
You’re the guy from Marino’s.

1385
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:21,250
I kept trying to figure
out who you were.

1386
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:23,683
And I remember you
for two reasons.

1387
01:08:23,696 --> 01:08:26,584
One, you got the hair of
Bancroft, Mrs. Robinson.

1388
01:08:26,597 --> 01:08:30,084
She used to drive me nuts.
And I love the way that you eat.

1389
01:08:30,097 --> 01:08:32,183
You know, you don’t give a
fuck what anybody thinks.

1390
01:08:32,196 --> 01:08:34,162
You just, you know,
you just go for it.

1391
01:08:35,629 --> 01:08:39,450
Wow. I never thought about it that
much. I just like pancakes.

1392
01:08:39,463 --> 01:08:41,190
Yeah. That’s cool.

1393
01:08:42,096 --> 01:08:44,918
Right. So, um, I’ll
see you at Marino’s.

1394
01:08:44,931 --> 01:08:47,488
Okay. You’ll see me at Marino’s.

1395
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:54,317
Hey.

1396
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:55,183
(Maureen) Hi.

1397
01:08:55,196 --> 01:08:55,950
Hi. You want a drink?

1398
01:08:55,963 --> 01:08:57,749
No. Just some more ice.

1399
01:08:57,762 --> 01:08:58,816
Yeah.

1400
01:08:58,829 --> 01:09:01,251
Cheston, he s, he’s terrific, isn’t he?

1401
01:09:01,264 --> 01:09:04,084
He’s super. He loves you.

1402
01:09:04,097 --> 01:09:07,784
He thinks you’re
some sort of arch Dr. Phil.

1403
01:09:07,797 --> 01:09:09,084
Dr. Phil.

1404
01:09:09,097 --> 01:09:09,917
Yeah.

1405
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:11,617
No, no, no. He’s a bozo.

1406
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:16,516
When I give advice, it’s target specific.

1407
01:09:16,529 --> 01:09:18,750
And what advice did you give him exactly?

1408
01:09:18,763 --> 01:09:20,351
He’s very tightlipped about it.

1409
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:22,650
Oh, well, I can’t reveal
all my confidences.

1410
01:09:22,663 --> 01:09:25,016
But you ought to know this
because I would never tell him

1411
01:09:25,029 --> 01:09:29,883
anything that you said
you know, or what I saw or,

1412
01:09:29,896 --> 01:09:32,749
you know what might gonna happen.

1413
01:09:32,762 --> 01:09:34,084
What’s gonna happen, Ben?

1414
01:09:34,097 --> 01:09:37,483
Well, it’s not really the
question of the moment, is it?

1415
01:09:37,496 --> 01:09:38,650
No.

1416
01:09:38,663 --> 01:09:41,250
No. No. The question of the moment is

1417
01:09:41,263 --> 01:09:44,382
what are you getting
out of the transaction?

1418
01:09:44,395 --> 01:09:46,316
What transaction?

1419
01:09:46,329 --> 01:09:48,982
Well, you know what I mean. Between
the, uh, the two of you.

1420
01:09:48,995 --> 01:09:51,283
I mean you got your little jokes,
you know, the Spanish

1421
01:09:51,296 --> 01:09:53,783
thing, interests are the
same, and the studying.

1422
01:09:53,796 --> 01:10:00,093
But, um, are you getting it,
you know, where it counts?

1423
01:10:01,862 --> 01:10:05,215
Oh, Ben. Cheston thinks
you care about him.

1424
01:10:05,228 --> 01:10:07,581
This has nothing to do with him.

1425
01:10:07,594 --> 01:10:10,750
He’s never gonna know about this.
Never.

1426
01:10:10,763 --> 01:10:12,697
Aren’t you a little old for all this?

1427
01:10:16,096 --> 01:10:18,783
You’re still standing here, aren’t you?

1428
01:10:18,796 --> 01:10:21,749
Yeah, cause I’m contemplating
throwing this drink in your

1429
01:10:21,762 --> 01:10:25,718
face. But I’m not going to because I
don’t want Cheston to

1430
01:10:25,731 --> 01:10:31,822
know what you just tried. So
you can just walk away. Please.

1431
01:10:33,096 --> 01:10:35,289
Nothing personal.

1432
01:10:38,062 --> 01:10:39,581
Hey.

1433
01:10:39,594 --> 01:10:41,717
That is it, actually. Since you asked,

1434
01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:44,583
that’s what I get from him.
Something personal.

1435
01:10:44,596 --> 01:10:47,617
Besides getting it done where
it counts, which he does

1436
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:53,683
Cheston and I reach each other.
He’s tender and sweet and

1437
01:10:53,696 --> 01:10:57,082
smart and funny, a million
things that you aren’t.

1438
01:10:57,095 --> 01:11:00,730
I was once, honey.
It doesn’t last.

1439
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:39,517
(Nascarella) I’m gonna
tell you a few things.

1440
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:43,482
Then I’m gonna do a few things. Huh?
First, you’re not getting

1441
01:11:43,495 --> 01:11:48,915
robbed. Just stay there.
Second. My name is Nascarella.

1442
01:11:48,928 --> 01:11:50,984
Now, I’m giving you my
particulars so you understand

1443
01:11:50,997 --> 01:11:53,550
you can forget about going
to the cops with this.

1444
01:11:53,563 --> 01:11:56,116
I was on the job thirty years. They
give me a nice gold shield.

1445
01:11:56,129 --> 01:11:57,949
There’s no help there
for you, my friend.

1446
01:11:57,962 --> 01:12:01,983
Plus, I squared it
with campus security.

1447
01:12:01,996 --> 01:12:04,682
Seems, uh, you’ve thrown the
first punch before, huh?

1448
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,051
Just like tonight?

1449
01:12:06,064 --> 01:12:08,750
The fu, fuck you
want from me, huh?

1450
01:12:08,763 --> 01:12:12,849
I picked up all my debts
in Vegas, AC, you now.

1451
01:12:12,862 --> 01:12:14,783
That’s damn good, pal. But
It’s got nothing to do with me.

1452
01:12:14,796 --> 01:12:18,415
I run security for
Allyson Karsch’s father.

1453
01:12:18,428 --> 01:12:22,883
And the third thing I
wanna tell you is, leave.

1454
01:12:22,896 --> 01:12:24,549
I mean, as soon as you can.

1455
01:12:24,562 --> 01:12:26,949
You were warned once
before but you ignored it.

1456
01:12:26,962 --> 01:12:28,616
Now, are you gonna ignore me?

1457
01:12:28,629 --> 01:12:29,916
No.

1458
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:31,849
No. Uh, I’m gonna go.

1459
01:12:31,862 --> 01:12:33,915
You mean that? It is a promise?

1460
01:12:33,928 --> 01:12:37,081
I’m gonna go, I m
gonna go in the morning,

1461
01:12:37,094 --> 01:12:38,847
first thing, I’m gonna go.

1462
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:40,716
Not sure you’ll be able
to get on your way that quickly.

1463
01:12:40,729 --> 01:12:41,716
What?

1464
01:12:41,729 --> 01:12:45,015
Come on, you can get up. Come on.

1465
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:47,381
Let me help you.
That’s it. Good.

1466
01:12:47,394 --> 01:12:48,715
Good. That’s good.
Hey, you okay?

1467
01:12:48,728 --> 01:12:49,148
Yeah.

1468
01:12:49,161 --> 01:12:49,961
Okay.

1469
01:13:08,695 --> 01:13:11,981
Do not ignore me.

1470
01:13:11,994 --> 01:13:14,396
No broad is worth it.

1471
01:13:30,796 --> 01:13:32,649
(Jimmy) We gotta
go to the hospital.

1472
01:13:32,662 --> 01:13:36,549
No, no, no hospitals.
I just, oh, I wanna lie down.

1473
01:13:36,562 --> 01:13:39,915
I won’t let you close your eyes
until we get this looked at.

1474
01:13:39,928 --> 01:13:41,281
You won’t let me.

1475
01:13:41,294 --> 01:13:43,848
No. I mean, you could
have internal injuries.

1476
01:13:43,861 --> 01:13:46,281
You hit your head.
I mean, we need a doctor.

1477
01:13:46,294 --> 01:13:47,816
I don’t need a doctor.

1478
01:13:47,829 --> 01:13:49,950
Jesus Christ, you’re too
fucking good to be true.

1479
01:13:49,963 --> 01:13:53,416
What the fuck you care about
whether I get looked at or not?

1480
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:57,315
You know, don’t start all
that, that friend bullshit.

1481
01:13:57,328 --> 01:13:59,914
Well, well, we are friends.

1482
01:13:59,927 --> 01:14:03,113
I haven’t seen you in
thirty years, all right?

1483
01:14:03,126 --> 01:14:04,748
That has nothing to do with this.

1484
01:14:04,761 --> 01:14:08,049
See, that’s where you and I, you
know, are a little different.

1485
01:14:08,062 --> 01:14:10,282
I don’t exactly have,
uh, faith in that racket.

1486
01:14:10,295 --> 01:14:11,648
What, the friendship racket?

1487
01:14:11,661 --> 01:14:12,991
Yeah.

1488
01:14:13,195 --> 01:14:15,881
You know, you had a lot of
friends when you were here, Ben.

1489
01:14:15,894 --> 01:14:17,281
A lot of friends.

1490
01:14:17,294 --> 01:14:19,180
Yeah, uh, I’ll tell you where
there’s a place for friends.

1491
01:14:19,193 --> 01:14:22,150
You know where it’s in that,
that, that, that midrange

1492
01:14:22,163 --> 01:14:25,749
you know, where everything is
comfortable, we’re all the same.

1493
01:14:25,762 --> 01:14:30,715
Right there in the middle. Huh? But
at your highest moments and

1494
01:14:30,728 --> 01:14:33,915
your lowest, you’re alone.

1495
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:40,417
I’m on the cover of Forbes magazine,
right? I’m by myself.

1496
01:14:40,430 --> 01:14:42,916
I’m on the, uh, the front
of the Times Business,

1497
01:14:42,929 --> 01:14:46,715
uh, section In Handcuffs.
I’m, I’m there by myself.

1498
01:14:46,728 --> 01:14:47,982
That is not true.

1499
01:14:47,995 --> 01:14:50,914
Please, please. They pull
at you. They smile at you.

1500
01:14:50,927 --> 01:14:52,281
All they wanna do is kill ya.

1501
01:14:52,294 --> 01:14:55,015
Listen, they’d fucking
kill ya to take your place.

1502
01:14:55,028 --> 01:14:57,949
And I’m, I’m walking on
my, my way to court

1503
01:14:57,962 --> 01:15:00,082
thinking anybody’s asking, hey,
wonder what’s going on in, in

1504
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:05,082
Ben’s mind, you know?
I couldn’t give a shit.

1505
01:15:05,095 --> 01:15:10,549
Hey, I remember Nancy. She would
never treat you that way. Never.

1506
01:15:13,661 --> 01:15:16,581
Cause Nancy was legit.

1507
01:15:16,594 --> 01:15:19,526
And I was legit to Nancy.

1508
01:15:21,027 --> 01:15:24,925
And when I couldn’t be
anymore, you know, I left.

1509
01:15:27,694 --> 01:15:29,582
If it means anything

1510
01:15:29,595 --> 01:15:33,515
when you were on the cover
of Forbes magazine

1511
01:15:33,528 --> 01:15:36,048
I was on the cover
of Forbes magazine.

1512
01:15:36,061 --> 01:15:39,050
I saved it and everything.

1513
01:15:41,193 --> 01:15:43,590
I believe you.

1514
01:15:44,759 --> 01:15:46,489
Good.

1515
01:15:46,895 --> 01:15:50,382
I just, I don’t how
to be like you, Jimmy.

1516
01:15:50,395 --> 01:15:53,656
I don’t really know
where to start.

1517
01:15:54,429 --> 01:15:56,860
Go start tomorrow.

1518
01:15:57,728 --> 01:15:59,489
Let’s go inside.

1519
01:16:01,694 --> 01:16:03,252
Aarg!

1520
01:16:04,662 --> 01:16:06,422
Shit.

1521
01:16:07,695 --> 01:16:11,593
Oh, I think, I think I
cracked a couple of ribs.

1522
01:16:25,561 --> 01:16:26,914
Suse?

1523
01:16:26,927 --> 01:16:29,688
Hey, dad.

1524
01:16:30,927 --> 01:16:33,913
At least I can understand myself now.

1525
01:16:33,926 --> 01:16:36,915
They lowered the painkillers. They
had to keep it high at

1526
01:16:36,928 --> 01:16:40,848
first so you wouldn’t move and cause
more internal damage.

1527
01:16:40,861 --> 01:16:44,315
You’re gonna be okay.

1528
01:16:48,327 --> 01:16:50,846
You came to see me?

1529
01:16:50,859 --> 01:16:53,054
Yeah.

1530
01:16:53,528 --> 01:16:56,515
You’re gold, Suse.

1531
01:16:56,528 --> 01:17:00,289
You’re pure gold.

1532
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,716
How long can you stay?

1533
01:17:09,729 --> 01:17:11,416
For now.

1534
01:17:11,429 --> 01:17:16,224
Then I have to take off, but
I’ll sit with you ‘til then.

1535
01:17:17,861 --> 01:17:21,480
I’m sorry about Carol Salomonde.
I shouldn’t...

1536
01:17:21,493 --> 01:17:23,880
don’t think about that now.

1537
01:17:23,893 --> 01:17:25,484
Just rest.

1538
01:17:27,728 --> 01:17:30,216
Thanks, pumpkin.

1539
01:17:36,927 --> 01:17:38,825
(nurse)
Here, let me help you.

1540
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:42,514
You’re feeling quite nicely?

1541
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,748
Yeah, well, it hurts like a beast.

1542
01:17:43,761 --> 01:17:46,782
Well, it’s gonna be
sore for sometime still.

1543
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:49,692
The doctors will be
in after their rounds.

1544
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,913
Now, I know that they spoke to
your doctor back in New York.

1545
01:17:55,926 --> 01:17:59,347
While you were under sedation
they ran a series of tests.

1546
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,615
I know that we’re not supposed
to discuss results with you.

1547
01:18:01,628 --> 01:18:04,348
Well, what, what kind of tests?
Who, who, who told ‘em?

1548
01:18:04,361 --> 01:18:06,248
You did.

1549
01:18:06,261 --> 01:18:08,380
And you signed consent
forms when you came in.

1550
01:18:08,393 --> 01:18:09,747
I don’t remember that.

1551
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,080
Yeah, you wouldn t.
You know, the alcohol

1552
01:18:12,093 --> 01:18:14,579
and shock to your
system was pretty extreme.

1553
01:18:14,592 --> 01:18:15,979
So, what kind of tests?

1554
01:18:15,992 --> 01:18:18,960
They ran a series
concentrating on your heart.

1555
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,647
Am I hooked up here to anything else?

1556
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:26,314
Just to the I.V.

1557
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:29,247
You wanna take this out, please?
Oooh.

1558
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:30,913
That’s against doctor’s orders.

1559
01:18:30,926 --> 01:18:32,779
Well, if you don’t take it out,
I’m gonna take this with me,

1560
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:34,028
because I’m leaving.

1561
01:19:27,627 --> 01:19:29,422
(Daniel) Ben.

1562
01:19:30,493 --> 01:19:32,247
I did you wrong, kid.

1563
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:34,346
I’m here to make it right.

1564
01:19:34,359 --> 01:19:35,779
Really.

1565
01:19:35,792 --> 01:19:38,880
Yeah, you know, you gave me back
my shirt and I never gave you

1566
01:19:38,893 --> 01:19:41,246
back the one I borrowed. So.

1567
01:19:41,259 --> 01:19:44,280
Uh, this isn’t my shirt.

1568
01:19:44,293 --> 01:19:48,147
No, no that particular shirt’s
in some storage box in New York,

1569
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,314
so I bought you a new one.

1570
01:19:49,327 --> 01:19:52,156
And, you know, thought it
would look good on you.

1571
01:19:53,392 --> 01:19:54,687
All right. Thanks.

1572
01:19:55,658 --> 01:19:58,615
Also, it appears I
might have done you wrong

1573
01:19:58,628 --> 01:20:00,914
a couple of other ways, too.

1574
01:20:00,927 --> 01:20:05,315
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I know. She told me.

1575
01:20:05,328 --> 01:20:08,414
She didn’t want to, but I saw
that something was bothering

1576
01:20:08,427 --> 01:20:11,913
her. She said that,
that you were drunk...

1577
01:20:11,926 --> 01:20:14,946
that I shouldn’t be mad,
that it was just kinda sad.

1578
01:20:14,959 --> 01:20:16,688
That that’s who you are.

1579
01:20:18,227 --> 01:20:20,280
See, she might be a good one.

1580
01:20:20,293 --> 01:20:21,913
I forgot to tell you
about the good ones.

1581
01:20:21,926 --> 01:20:24,113
You know, they re, they’re
different than all the others.

1582
01:20:24,126 --> 01:20:27,947
And, um... you know, they’re rare.

1583
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:31,346
And when you get a good one
you don’t wanna fuck it up.

1584
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:34,948
Yeah, I know. I, I
figured that out myself.

1585
01:20:34,961 --> 01:20:38,247
Figured you would.
You’re a good one, too.

1586
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:39,782
Okay.

1587
01:20:43,659 --> 01:20:44,513
Hey.

1588
01:20:44,526 --> 01:20:45,812
Thanks for the shirt.

1589
01:20:45,825 --> 01:20:47,458
De nada.

1590
01:21:14,558 --> 01:21:16,712
Okay, Nance.

1591
01:21:16,725 --> 01:21:18,412
When was the first
time that a doctor sent

1592
01:21:18,425 --> 01:21:20,879
you for a heart scan?

1593
01:21:20,892 --> 01:21:23,048
Hospital called you.

1594
01:21:23,061 --> 01:21:24,948
Called your daughter.

1595
01:21:24,961 --> 01:21:27,547
Uh, Dr. Steinberg
ordered up that test about

1596
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,913
six and a half years ago.

1597
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:34,713
And how long after that
did you start cheating?

1598
01:21:34,726 --> 01:21:36,579
That day.

1599
01:21:36,592 --> 01:21:41,547
And you never went back to
have the test done, did you?

1600
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:42,947
No.

1601
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,580
Can’t use that as an excuse though.
It was a factor.

1602
01:21:45,593 --> 01:21:48,447
But, uh, you know,
things were building up.

1603
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:49,680
Building up?

1604
01:21:49,693 --> 01:21:51,313
Yeah.

1605
01:21:51,326 --> 01:21:54,883
I was becoming invisible.

1606
01:21:56,192 --> 01:21:58,047
Invisible?

1607
01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:00,579
Look, thirty years ago I would
walk into a room, that room

1608
01:22:00,592 --> 01:22:02,980
would change just
because I was there.

1609
01:22:02,993 --> 01:22:05,479
It was, you know, I was a
graduate, self made man, great

1610
01:22:05,492 --> 01:22:07,845
shape. I had the TV
commercials, all that stuff.

1611
01:22:07,858 --> 01:22:10,346
I remember. I was right next to the
camera when you shot them.

1612
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:11,479
You know what it was like back then.

1613
01:22:11,492 --> 01:22:13,881
I was a lion. That’s
how people looked at me.

1614
01:22:13,894 --> 01:22:16,547
But then, you know,
things started to change.

1615
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,212
And over the, uh, past ten or
twelve years, I’d walk into a

1616
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:22,946
room and the only old people noticed
me. They knew who I am.

1617
01:22:22,959 --> 01:22:25,912
And to everybody else I’m invisible.

1618
01:22:25,925 --> 01:22:27,512
You were never invisible to me.

1619
01:22:27,525 --> 01:22:30,846
Well, that doesn’t count
because you were my wife.

1620
01:22:30,859 --> 01:22:33,779
Oh. Well. You know what,
Benny? If you’re lucky,

1621
01:22:33,792 --> 01:22:35,513
that’s what happens. You get old.

1622
01:22:35,526 --> 01:22:37,179
No, I, I accept it’s biological.

1623
01:22:37,192 --> 01:22:39,246
I just don’t accept
that it happened to me.

1624
01:22:39,259 --> 01:22:42,412
So, when, uh, Steinberg said he
thought he saw something on the

1625
01:22:42,425 --> 01:22:47,480
EKG, I got nervous. And when
he called up the heart scan,

1626
01:22:47,493 --> 01:22:49,980
uh, to see if there was any blockage...

1627
01:22:49,993 --> 01:22:52,780
I had every intention of walking
out of his office and going

1628
01:22:52,793 --> 01:22:53,980
right there to check on it.

1629
01:22:53,993 --> 01:22:55,279
But instead?

1630
01:22:55,292 --> 01:22:57,379
Instead I went into a bar and
grill on Lexington Avenue

1631
01:22:57,392 --> 01:23:00,446
had a couple of pops
to calm down and, uh

1632
01:23:00,459 --> 01:23:03,046
I picked up the first young girl
who said yes and took her back

1633
01:23:03,059 --> 01:23:05,948
to a suite at the Carlyle.

1634
01:23:05,961 --> 01:23:07,713
And what did that do for you?

1635
01:23:07,726 --> 01:23:09,247
The truth?

1636
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:11,521
Did plenty.

1637
01:23:12,992 --> 01:23:15,246
See, I figured you’d see it on
my face, you’d know straight

1638
01:23:15,259 --> 01:23:17,412
off. But you didn’t. You
didn’t say anything, you know.

1639
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:20,644
So, I kept right on going.

1640
01:23:20,657 --> 01:23:24,079
And then, uh, you know, awhile
after that I’m up in my shop at

1641
01:23:24,092 --> 01:23:26,513
white plains looking
at the books. And I say to

1642
01:23:26,526 --> 01:23:30,212
myself, why should I be New York’s
honest car dealer?

1643
01:23:30,225 --> 01:23:35,278
Then again, nobody said
anything. Nothing for years.

1644
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:39,179
But you know, I, I still
don’t understand why you...

1645
01:23:39,192 --> 01:23:42,680
you didn’t go back and have
the test just to make sure.

1646
01:23:44,992 --> 01:23:48,245
I’m gonna go to a doctor and
give him that kind of power?

1647
01:23:48,258 --> 01:23:50,111
The, the when, the
where and the how?

1648
01:23:50,124 --> 01:23:51,478
There’s no, there’s no way.

1649
01:23:51,491 --> 01:23:53,045
You know what it’s like
when we get our age.

1650
01:23:53,058 --> 01:23:55,713
The best thing a doctor can say
is, uh, well, oh, the survival

1651
01:23:55,726 --> 01:24:00,446
rate is high... or,
uh, it’s a good cancer, or...

1652
01:24:00,459 --> 01:24:02,912
uh, hey, you know, no problem.
We got it early.

1653
01:24:02,925 --> 01:24:04,312
I don’t wanna hear any of that.

1654
01:24:04,325 --> 01:24:07,111
And I wasn’t gonna go
get some of those, uh...

1655
01:24:07,124 --> 01:24:10,377
those, those beta blockers and
all that crap that slow you down

1656
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:13,279
and level you out. I was gonna live
my life the way I wanted

1657
01:24:13,292 --> 01:24:16,213
to until the fucking
thing in my heart exploded.

1658
01:24:16,226 --> 01:24:20,846
But you can’t cheat death,
Benny. Nobody can and

1659
01:24:20,859 --> 01:24:24,222
no matter how many 19 year
olds you talk into your bed.

1660
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:28,525
I know that.
I know that now.

1661
01:24:32,726 --> 01:24:34,487
Well...

1662
01:24:37,059 --> 01:24:39,111
my car’s parked over there.

1663
01:24:39,124 --> 01:24:43,978
And I’d be happy to drive
you back to New York City...

1664
01:24:43,991 --> 01:24:46,788
if you’re ready.

1665
01:24:48,859 --> 01:24:51,222
Take a few minutes and...

1666
01:24:53,658 --> 01:24:56,146
you decide what you really want.
