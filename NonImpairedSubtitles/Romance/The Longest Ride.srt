Growing up with
immigrant parents,

838
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,888
my life was always
really different.

screaming in weird languages...

840

I brought smelly,
strange snacks to school.

841
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,964
My pants were
too short always.

842

843
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,282
Growing up on a cattle ranch,
everybody I knew was the same.

844
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,684
Everybody you know is fourth
generation cattle ranchers.

845
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,048
(SIGHS) I'm jealous.
Why?

846
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,680
I wanted to be like everyone
else when I was little.

847
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:26,409
The reason I like you is because
you're nothing like everyone else.

You're not so bad yourself.

849
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,885
I think before I met you,
the closest thing I came
to cattle was...

850
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,960
steak.

851
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,566
Steak? Time to get you
on a bull, then.
