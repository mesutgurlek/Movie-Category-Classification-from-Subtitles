** Pradeep I love you **

1
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,419
What is love?

2
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:23,784
Love?
...Love is life.

3
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:26,551
Love? What is love?

4
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,828
Where does it happen? Why does it
happen? And how does it happen?

5
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:34,331
I believe that God predetermined
all our emotional relationships.

6
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,329
But then He left it to us
to find each other.

7
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,763
He made us all couples
and for every one of us...

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,908
there is a soulmate.

9
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:47,736
A soulmate? What nonsense!
I don't believe in all this...

10
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:52,348
I'm absolutely sure that somewhere,
someone was made for me...

11
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,479
and that someday I shall
certainly meet him.

12
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,824
OK, but will someone
please tell me...

13
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,256
how will I know who was
made for me?

14
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:04,827
I mean, will she be wandering about
with a placard with my name on it?

15
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:09,734
When I see her, will there be a clap
of thunder and a flash of lightning?

16
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,700
How will I recognise her?

17
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:15,303
I don't know what others will do,
but I will recognise him.

18
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,742
He will speak to me, He will
give me a sign...

19
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,880
and my heart will realise
that this is him.

20
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,977
What is all this?

21
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:25,506
This is love

22
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,852
Love!

23
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,363
However far apart they may be...

24
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:47,402
Their paths will meet,
whatever happens...

25
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,399
When two people
are made for each other.

26
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,637
Made for each other.

27
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:03,289
The Heart Is Crazy

28
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:24,374
Like the heart and its beat-
Made for each other.

29
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:31,383
Like the eye and its sight -
Made for each other.

30
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:37,953
Like the monsoon and the rain -
Made for each other.

31
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:44,395
One lover, one beloved
Made for each other

32
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,991
Made for each other

33
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,885
When God gave them a heart...

34
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,786
It was one heart in two pieces.

35
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,486
He wrote one name on both...

36
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,826
He wrote 'Radha' and 'Krishna'.

37
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,432
Now these hearts beat together,

38
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,670
They come together
and they part.

39
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:31,002
When two people
are made for each other.

40
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:49,479
I don't know when,
Like a silent thief...

41
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:04,867
I don't know when,
like a silent thief...

42
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:08,701
The first look of love...

43
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,510
Took my heart away

44
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:37,559
In love's very first game
of hide N seek...

45
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:00,749
I hid myself in
the shelter of his eyes.

46
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,216
Now I'm frightened...

47
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,924
...because like a silent thief...

48
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,257
the first look of love...

49
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:20,868
Took my heart away

50
00:07:55,741 --> 00:08:02,544
My hair disheveled,
I walk like I'm drunk

51
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:26,161
If anyone sees me
They will ask what's up.

52
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,602
How can I go home like this?

53
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,844
Jimmy, get Rahul.

54
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:15,881
Rahul's not here.

55
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:19,583
Go and look for him then!
And fast!

56
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,916
I'll be right back.

57
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,294
- Shruti, have you seen Rahul?
- No, I haven't.

58
00:09:54,527 --> 00:10:01,399
I don't know when,
like a silent thief...

59
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,370
the first glance of love...

60
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:13,241
took my heart away.

61
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:46,344
Rahul! How often have I told you that
I get anxious when you're late...

62
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,841
Sorry, Nisha, I got this idea
at the last minute...

63
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,844
and I thought that if
I shoot out of the stage...

64
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,846
the audience will freak out
and that's what happened.

65
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,484
What's the fuss all about?

66
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,350
Look here, Rahul... I'm fed up
with your last minute entries

67
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,354
Hey kid, I'm the director.
I do what I want.

68
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:00,889
I can change whomever
I like, even you.

69
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,761
Yeah, but you'll never
get another dancer like me.

70
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,793
If I want I can
get Shruti to dance.

71
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,795
Nisha! Fight with
Rahul later please.

72
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,802
It's time to go on stage.
Take the mike.

73
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:41,365
I want to thank
you all very much...

74
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,568
for making this dance show
such a big success.

75
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:49,335
As you all know, this is the
last night of this show.

76
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:53,408
However, I promise you that
we'll be back in three months...

77
00:11:53,579 --> 00:12:00,781
with a new story, new songs
and a new name.

78
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,986
Yes, 'Maya' is the name
of our new dance show.

79
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,872
Rahul, this new play 'Maya'...
what's it all about? Tell us.

80
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,876
Yes! Tell us about it!

81
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,886
Okay...

82
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,589
I don't know.

83
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,427
What?!

84
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:49,364
If you didn't know that,
then why did you tell everyone...

85
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,435
that we'll do a new show
called 'Maya'...

86
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,333
and that we'll do it
in three months?

87
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,939
Now look, even I don't know
who or what Maya is.

88
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:59,402
But I do know that in three months,
we'll do a show called 'Maya'.

89
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,347
Do you have in mind
a girl who's like Maya?

90
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,351
Right now, Maya is not even
in my perception.

91
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,452
Hey, Nisha! I've got
a girl in mind.

92
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,494
Rahul! Aren't you talking
about Pami, the Colonel's daughter?

93
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,231
Rahul, are you in love
with a girl like Maya?

94
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:28,429
No, I'm not in love with anyone
but lots of girls love me.

95
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,910
But Maya is the kind of girl
that anyone would love.

96
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,552
Maya is the kind of girl for whom
you would leave even Soni.

97
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,584
You'd better watch out
if you cheat on my sister.

98
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:43,949
Ballu, shut up.

99
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,992
What does she do?

100
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,618
She spins dreams.

101
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,624
Is Maya beautiful?

102
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:57,531
Very.

103
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,168
This Maya must do something...

104
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:09,505
Maya dances...
but only for herself.

105
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,916
Excuse me, but she is a feeling,
a fantasy, beautiful...

106
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,924
and a dancer. But we've got to
find her in three months.

107
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,351
So who is she?

108
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,462
Maya is all these things
and yet she is only Maya.

109
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,465
We've gone around in circles
and we're back where we started.

110
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,328
Are you trying to
make us look dumb?

111
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,546
I've done chores all my life!
But I'll decide this today!

112
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,447
Silly girl!
Where were you?

113
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,450
- I was outside.
- Now you have to come with me.

114
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,455
I'm tired of the promises
your uncle makes everyday.

115
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,595
So, today we're going to have a
fight and you have to take my side.

116
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,668
Bravo, bravo! What a performance!
Wonderful!

117
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:21,508
Panditji... excuse me, Panditji

118
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,511
Go on, Chandni... er, Shanti

119
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,516
Please allow us to have a teabreak.

120
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,187
Break whatever you want.

121
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,756
Please allow me to have
a word with your students.

122
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,726
By all means.

123
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,464
Watchman! Gardener!

124
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:45,570
Shankar and Ramu, if you don't mind,
perhaps you'd all get back to work!

125
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,669
Where are you going?

126
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,807
Why are you driving away
my audience?

127
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,567
Please be quiet.

128
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,235
You gather the servants here so they
can't get on with their work!

129
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,539
I have to do it all
by myself.

130
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,549
As of today, no music recitals.
From today...

131
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,153
only you will sing and only
you will listen. No audience.

132
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:07,191
Even in my own house my songs
aren't appreciated.

133
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,155
So how will others
appreciate them?

134
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:13,728
Because of your aunt's behavior,
I never became a great singer.

135
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,598
I know, I know...
Now have a cup of tea.

136
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,463
No, I don't want any tea.

137
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,540
Have a cup of tea...
and sing a song for me.

138
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,208
Will you listen to my song?

139
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,247
- Really?
- Certainly.

140
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,212
So let me have the tea!

141
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,484
Here, this is your parcel.

142
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,256
It's from Ajay!
There must be a cassette in there.

143
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,625
- Hear my song first.
- Later, uncle... please!

144
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,296
See that? You have always
driven away my audience!

145
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,299
What are you dreaming about?

146
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,632
I was thinking
how fast time flies.

147
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,636
It seems like yesterday that
Mr. Khanna and Geeta...

148
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:00,233
had that accident and
Pooja came to our house.

149
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:05,182
And now, it seems as if we have
no existence without her.

150
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,318
And I have never seen such
close friends as Pooja and Ajay.

151
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,551
Hey, fatty! How are you?

152
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,384
Shut up, I'm not fat.

153
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,388
I've heard that nowadays you're
really packing your food away.

154
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,595
Don't do that or
no one will marry you!

155
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:21,254
Idiot! Don't worry about my marriage!
Who's going to marry you?

156
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,595
By now, you must have finished
cursing me. So I'll proceed.

157
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:28,502
I'm having fun, as usual, and work
and girls are keeping me busy.

158
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,608
Tell you what? I never realised
how handsome I am.

159
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:32,675
Oh really!!

160
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,506
Don't make faces.

161
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,443
If you wish I can fax you
a list of my girlfriends.

162
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:42,285
For your information, I've left Tina
because she doesn't like Hindi films.

163
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,285
Thank God. She was really stupid...

164
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,617
- And now my heart is elsewhere...
- Who is she?

165
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,657
Don't yell, I'm telling you.
She's called Dolly.

166
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,660
There's no need to worry.
She really likes Hindi movies.

167
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,324
And yes, I forgot
to tell you something.

168
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,663
I may be coming to Bombay
for a few days.

169
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,701
- When?!
- There's no need to stand...

170
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,567
Sit down.
It's not fixed as yet.

171
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,572
As soon as I get to know,
I'll tell you.

172
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,576
OK, I'm off. Dolly is coming and
even though you haven't told me...

173
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,646
- I'll give her your love.
- There's no need.

174
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,644
OK, I won't...
Hey! Here she comes!

175
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,250
OK, I'm going...
Give mum and dad my love!

176
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:25,295
Hey Nisha, where've you put that
cassette you took from my car?

177
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,761
You know there was a really
important track on it of our play.

178
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,630
Anything that goes into your room
vanishes forever.

179
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:38,342
You have no manners. You must knock
before coming into a girl's room.

180
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,671
Is there a girl here?

181
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,507
I am! Stupid!
And seriously...

182
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,341
Look, don't talk to me
in this girly girly way. Please!

183
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,577
You have also entered my room
when I had nothing on. So?

184
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,346
- That's different.
- Why is it different?

185
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,392
Go on now...
get my cassette.

186
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,728
First say sorry,
then you'll get the cassette.

187
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,661
- Must I say sorry?!
- Yes.

188
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,735
- Say sorry to you?
- Yes.

189
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,702
I'll fix you, Nisha!

190
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,950
Come on, give me back my cassette!

191
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,454
- Give it to me!
- I won't!

192
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,451
- Now say you're sorry!
- Sorry for what?

193
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,824
Sorry that you've wasted
my time and made me run.

194
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,828
- I won't say I'm sorry.
- Say sorry!

195
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,832
And quickly say that you
won't annoy me ever again.

196
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,833
- I'll never annoy you!
- Say: Rahul is the best.

197
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,836
Never...
Okay! Rahul is the best.

198
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,772
Whatever happens I shan't
dance in your play!

199
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,642
So be it. There are plenty
of dancers like you!

200
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,249
There's no one
who dances like me!

201
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,477
Pooja... my marriage
has been arranged.

202
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,477
Marriage?!

203
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,217
Anjali, what's up with you?
You're going to marry someone...

204
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:39,529
you haven't chosen?
Someone you hardly know?!

205
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,825
I do know him.
He's the son of Mr. Kapoor.

206
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,902
I've known him for years.

207
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,229
But you don't love him.

208
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:52,906
Well, Pooja... love will
happen in due course.

209
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,911
What are you saying, Anjali?

210
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,445
We're not children
any more, Pooja.

211
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,987
It's time we emerged from
our world of fantasies.

212
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:06,990
We are Indian girls.

213
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:11,953
The lovers of our dreams and
our husbands are not the same.

214
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:17,665
Someone else chooses
our husbands for us.

215
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:22,872
We learn to love them.
This is the truth and...

216
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,500
the sooner you realise it,
the better.

217
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,870
Don't make this mistake, Anjali.

218
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:36,884
Someone, somewhere is made for you
and you should wait for him.

219
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,989
Perhaps this one is him.

220
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:48,598
I'm sure that this is the one
who was made for me.

221
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,932
And who knows?
This might happen to you.

222
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:59,337
Tomorrow you might marry a man
whom you merely know...

223
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:05,182
and slowly you might realise that
he was the one you were waiting for.

224
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,916
Nothing like this
will happen to me.

225
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,780
I'll choose my husband myself.

226
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:17,992
There can't be
a girl like this.

227
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:19,895
Meaning?

228
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,565
Rahul, this character
is a mistake...

229
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,895
and Maya exists
only in your dreams.

230
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,898
Modern girls aren't like this.

231
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,899
What do you know?
You're not a girl.

232
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,910
Maya is not one of these
modern girls.

233
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,943
She's something else...
She is my Maya.

234
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:40,617
Your Maya, indeed!

235
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:44,619
What do you know about girls?
You know only one. And that's me!

236
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,947
What do you mean? I don't know
anything about love...

237
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,657
and yet I'm making this
love story. What of it?

238
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,622
Rahul, your Maya
is really crazy.

239
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,991
Don't you call
my Maya crazy!

240
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,992
You are the only one
who feels this.

241
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:58,997
- Nobody else is saying anything.
- Definitely!

242
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,532
Rahul, I think Nisha is right.

243
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,241
I don't understand this
Maya character either.

244
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,536
Her character seems false.

245
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,583
Looking at it from
a psychological point of view...

246
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,582
I'm sure that you're
on your own trip.

247
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:24,928
- Do you also want to say something?
- I think we need a lunchbreak.

248
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,893
Look, I don't know if there is
such a girl or not...

249
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,633
and I don't want to know.

250
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,330
Whether she is a lie,
a fantasy or mad or whatever...

251
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,637
If you cannot understand this,
I am very sorry.

252
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,812
I can't do anything
about this, but...

253
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:46,980
under no circumstances am I going
to change the character of Maya.

254
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,649
I think Rahul's right.

255
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,985
You shut up.
You are Rahul's yes man.

256
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,953
- I was only saying that...
- Okay... what were you saying?

257
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,560
Do you know of such a girl?

258
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,595
Is your Soni like this?
No.

259
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:02,926
Do you understand the
character of Maya?

260
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,862
- No.
- Should we do this play?

261
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:06,932
That's exactly what
I have been saying!

262
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,604
But...

263
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,245
An innocent face...

264
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,457
Mischief in her eyes...

265
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:28,953
Oh my!

266
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,668
An innocent face;
mischief in her eyes...

267
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,205
She stands far away from me,
looking shy.

268
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,207
Oh my!

269
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:49,213
She lets me catch a glimpse of
her face, then she turns away.

270
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:57,720
If you look with my eyes, friend,
you can see her.

271
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,249
She's no ordinary girl,
she's a magical being.

272
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:02,149
What else can I say
to describe her.

273
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:08,658
Last night she appeared in my dreams,
her hair flowing wildly.

274
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:15,391
When I woke up, I wished
I could go back to my dream.

275
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,701
If this how I feel
without meeting her...

276
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,201
what will happen when I do?

277
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:30,773
Her eyeliner is dark like the
first cloud of the rainy season

278
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:37,780
She moves like
a wave on the ocean.

279
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:44,783
From what special substance
did God make her body?

280
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:50,260
I wish that one-day, magically,
she becomes a reality.

281
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:33,164
Perhaps you haven't noticed
but everyone is staring at us.

282
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,372
So what? I don't care.

283
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:41,376
I'll be back in a moment.

284
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,417
Have you come shopping?

285
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,420
Alone?

286
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:55,422
Very good! Never make the mistake
of going shopping with a girl.

287
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,463
- Do you like it?
- I like it very much.

288
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,190
I like it very, very much too.
Let's go.

289
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,526
Once you've tried it on.

290
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,396
You like it and I like it...
Let's go, please.

291
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,465
To hell with Rahul!

292
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:10,966
- What did you say?
- Nothing, nothing at all.

293
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,401
Off you go!

294
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,270
Who is it?

295
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:24,542
Why are you laughing?
What's up?

296
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,474
Where are your jeans?

297
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,618
Come on, I'm wearing my jeans.

298
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,552
It happens, y'know.

299
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,260
Who's there?

300
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,178
Crazy!

301
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:19,564
Everybody clap...
Open the cake box.

302
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:26,240
How did this happen?

303
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:29,578
What happened and
when did it happen?

304
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:33,282
How did this get swapped over?
I had ordered a chocolate cake.

305
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,619
You've brought someone
else's parcel.

306
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,618
I'm so stupid!
I should have checked.

307
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:42,620
It's all right, dear.

308
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,329
Other people celebrate their
birthdays by cutting a cake.

309
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,657
I'll celebrate mine
by cutting sandwiches.

310
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,766
Let me see who got my cake.

311
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,601
- Who's this Pooja?
- I don't know.

312
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,674
- And who's this uncle?
- Must be Pooja's uncle.

313
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:01,538
The first time I send you
to do something...

314
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,304
and you go and get
the boxes mixed up.

315
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,541
What have I done? I brought the
parcel the shopkeeper gave me.

316
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,581
But you should have checked.

317
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:11,243
Excuse me, but it wasn't up to me
to check. Next time, do it yourself.

318
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,249
I am hungry.
This cake looks really good.

319
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,293
- No one's eating this cake.
- Why not?

320
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:18,623
Because it belongs to someone else.

321
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,527
They must be eating eating
our sandwiches, too...

322
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:24,293
There's an address written here.
It's nearby. Go and deliver it.

323
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,628
Have you gone mad?

324
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,294
Rahul, this is someone's
birthday cake.

325
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,302
It was ordered with love
for that person.

326
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,306
Someone's party will be ruined.
Go and give it back.

327
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:33,635
I'm not going.

328
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:35,639
Rahul be damned!

329
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:38,577
Jimmy, let's go and give it back
and say 'Happy Birthday! '.

330
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,651
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

331
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,689
Good evening. Are you uncle?

332
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,363
No, I'm aunty.

333
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:57,360
Actually, by mistake
I got your cake, aunty.

334
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:58,863
The sandwich man!

335
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:02,598
That's right. Here's your cake...
Wishing you a happy birthday.

336
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,671
Thank you and sorry.

337
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,274
Why sorry?

338
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:09,275
Because I've eaten
your sandwiches.

339
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,612
That's all right. Actually, I ate
a bit of your cake on the way here.

340
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:15,613
No wonder...!

341
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,615
OK, I'll be off Uncle

342
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,881
No. Come in and
have some cake.

343
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,323
No thanks. I've got something
to do. I'm in a hurry.

344
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,620
Just a minute. Just one minute

345
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,660
Let the person who bought
this cake, thank you.

346
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,702
That poor man, whose sandwiches
you picked up by mistake...

347
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,933
has brought the
cake back.

348
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,712
Go and thank him.
He's at the door.

349
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:48,381
The cake has brought
a twinkle in my eyes...

350
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:52,722
and a musical rhythm to the
strings of my heart

351
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:05,458
Strange man.

352
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,728
Why are you buying
all this stuff?

353
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,403
Oh, Anjali...
Today is Valentine's Day

354
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,867
Don't you know about
Valentine's Day?

355
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:49,741
The man you love most in the world
is called your Valentine.

356
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,744
On this day, all lovers
tell each other...

357
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:53,780
about all the love they have
in their hearts.

358
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:56,442
This is all about love.
You won't understand.

359
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,455
But whom are you buying
all these things for?

360
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:01,654
- For myself.
- What?

361
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,758
You see, I don't have a lover.

362
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,895
So there's no one to buy me
all these lovely things.

363
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,362
I'm doing this
for my own pleasure.

364
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,634
You've gone quite mad.

365
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,359
Do you know, today isn't
an ordinary Valentine's Day.

366
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,797
After many years, today it falls
on the same day as the full moon.

367
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,640
Do you know what this means?

368
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,709
I don't, but I'm sure
you're going to tell me.

369
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:25,414
It means that if you believe
that someone is made for you...

370
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:27,675
and you are waiting for him
with a true heart...

371
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,752
you will certainly
meet him today.

372
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,420
And you really believe this?

373
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:35,422
Of course, I'm absolutely sure
that before midnight today...

374
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,892
I shall meet my soulmate.

375
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,463
Pooja! You're really mad!

376
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:42,422
That I am.

377
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,387
I'm going home. If you want
to come with me, then come on.

378
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,717
Rahul, we all came together
and we'll all go together.

379
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,427
This is a very boring party.
If you want to come, then come on.

380
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:14,758
Rahul, you don't get any better.
See, it's such a beautiful night...

381
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:24,771
and you're so unromantic.
Look, everyone's so much in love.

382
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,435
You think that
they're all in love?

383
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,778
Sit down.

384
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:36,783
Tell me something, Nisha.
You think you know what love is?

385
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:41,456
Love is when you're so fond of
someone, that your heart tells you...

386
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:44,493
you want to spend your whole
life in his arms.

387
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,453
That's what we call love.

388
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:50,497
You think the people here want to
spend the rest of their lives...

389
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,534
- with each other?
- I think so.

390
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,498
Girls are so daft.

391
00:37:56,974 --> 00:38:01,411
Do you know, most of these romances
will be over before tomorrow?

392
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,747
They'll fight over
small things...

393
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,677
and will never see
each other after tonight.

394
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,746
And next year, you will
see the same faces...

395
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,421
at the same places
in different arms.

396
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,751
- Boys are also really stupid.
- I'm telling you the facts, Nisha.

397
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:19,461
You must realise that you need
to know someone really well...

398
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,461
- to spend your life together.
- That's right.

399
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,464
And in order to know someone well
you need to spend time together?

400
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:26,834
True.

401
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,972
In today's world,
whose got the time?

402
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,508
Look; among all these party guests,
no one's known each other...

403
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,843
for as long as we've
known each other.

404
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,849
Does that mean that we can spend
a lifetime with each other?

405
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,779
Come on, don't just accept
what I'm saying...

406
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,511
but just tell me, could you spend
your whole life with me?

407
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,520
Here you are, Rahul!
And everyone wants you outside!

408
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:48,522
Why?

409
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,851
The thing is, my friend, people here
want to hear you sing a song.

410
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:52,718
- No way!
- Oh, come on!

411
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,902
Tell me, could you spend
your whole life with me?

412
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,807
Yes, Rahul. I could
spend it with you.

413
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,744
I could spend my
whole life with you.

414
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,226
The moon whispered something...

415
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,332
which the night heard...

416
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:18,647
The moon whispered something,
which the night heard...

417
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,246
Did you hear...

418
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,651
It said "fall in love"

419
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:40,236
The moonlight came to my street
and to my house,

420
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:45,507
To say "fall in love"

421
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:33,222
What can I say,
what can I do,

422
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:38,761
This strange thing
that has happened to me.

423
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:44,233
It is a sign or did my heart
whisper "fall in love"

424
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,442
There is someone,
I don't know who.

425
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,207
But I am certain that
there is someone.

426
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:07,749
He is somewhere in my dreams,
but I cannot see him

427
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,750
I am here...
he is somewhere there

428
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,416
Then whose voice was it...

429
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,330
that said "fall in love"

430
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:30,423
I have given my love to him,
he does not know.

431
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:35,839
How can I call him unfaithful,
he does not know.

432
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:41,377
I have tried to say so much,
he does not hear.

433
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,346
Oh my sad heart, be careful...

434
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:48,884
when you "fall in love"

435
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,830
You're really crazy. Is there
something wrong with your brain?

436
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:11,857
Going home like this
without telling anyone!

437
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,861
You said we had come together
and we'd all leave together.

438
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:15,364
Then you go and run away
all on your own.

439
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:17,507
You know that we're all worried.
You stupid idiot!

440
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:25,539
Er... this is not 6711237,
is it?

441
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:26,914
No.

442
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,583
I'm sorry, I thought
it was someone else.

443
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,511
You're right.
I am someone else.

444
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:35,491
Please excuse me.

445
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:36,920
It's OK.

446
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:39,428
Hang on, one minute...
don't hang up the phone.

447
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,328
Yes?

448
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:43,961
The music you're playing...

449
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,564
that's Pundit Shiv Kumar Sharma's
new album, isn't it?

450
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:48,535
Yes.

451
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:51,970
I just love it. Actually, you know,
I wanted to buy it.

452
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,469
- Where did you buy it from?
- 'Rhythm House'.

453
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:57,713
I haven't been there. Do you think
they would have it in stock?

454
00:46:57,948 --> 00:46:59,575
How would I know?

455
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,878
Oh right, stupid me...
how would you know?

456
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,853
You don't work there. I'm really
sorry about all this.

457
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:19,499
Nice voice.

458
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:27,586
How could you do this to me?!
You scared the hell out of me!

459
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,203
Now I'm not going to give up
until I've got you.

460
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:50,414
Wait till I get
my hands on you!

461
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:02,626
How about it?

462
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:33,352
Ballu! What are you up to?

463
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:34,791
Why, what's wrong, Rahul?

464
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:36,694
I told you that after
this drum roll is over...

465
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,390
the spotlight should
move from me to Nisha.

466
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:40,001
- And I thought...
- Shut up.

467
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:43,362
Come on, Nisha...
do it again.

468
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:46,737
What?

469
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,741
- Please pack up early today.
- Why? What's special about today?

470
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:52,743
Nothing. Come on.

471
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,746
Good. C'mon, everybody.
Let's take it from the top.

472
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,419
Rahul, you forgot?
Today is her birthday.

473
00:50:57,654 --> 00:50:59,417
Really? Why didn't
someone tell me?

474
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:04,488
Why didn't you tell me?

475
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:09,289
There are some things, Rahul, which
one knows without being told.

476
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:11,658
Even then... you people
should have said something.

477
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:13,665
Honestly, you guys
are the limit...

478
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,705
You've been forgetting
my birthday all these years.

479
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:22,707
This is just another year.

480
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:26,712
Stop putting on an act and
take us all out to dinner.

481
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:32,715
What is it?

482
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,758
You remembered!
So why didn't you say it?

483
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:42,760
There are some things which
one knows without being told.

484
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:47,764
Come on, let's rehearse!

485
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,484
What are you guys drinking?

486
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:15,726
- I want some.
- This isn't for ladies. So relax.

487
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:17,389
No, I want some.

488
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:19,398
I told you that this
isn't suitable for you!

489
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,399
Today's my birthday.

490
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:25,400
I'll do as I please.

491
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:29,740
OK... suit yourself.
Give me another glass.

492
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:32,713
Nothing.

493
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:34,783
You're in love? Give over!

494
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:38,578
I know your kind of love.
It changes every week.

495
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,789
Not my kind of love...
but your kind of love.

496
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:46,826
The marrying kind? Really?
Who's the girl. Do I know her?

497
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:48,825
Really well.

498
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,766
Tell me who she is, please!

499
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:55,599
- Must I?
- Shoot!

500
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:58,835
Forget it.

501
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:01,705
That hurts!

502
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:14,417
Didn't I tell you?
It's not for ladies!

503
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,931
Please, Ajay!
Tell me who she is!

504
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,803
Right then. We'll do this.
See that waiter?

505
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,804
- Which one?
- The one serving the water.

506
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,805
- So?
- Keep looking at him.

507
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:35,809
If there's still a glass of
water on that tray...

508
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:39,480
by the time he gets to our table
then I'll tell you her name.

509
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:55,528
Excuse me!
A glass of water, please!

510
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:57,858
That's cheating.
You can't do that.

511
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:25,784
Don't say anything.
Say nothing at all...

512
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:28,493
Take my shoes and give me money.

513
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:47,549
I'm afraid.
Don't leave me I'm scared

514
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,548
It's really late. Now quietly
go to sleep! Good night!

515
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,883
First promise me
that you won't leave me.

516
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,322
OK, baby, I shan't leave you alone.

517
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:01,458
You won't leave me, even if I ask
for an ice-cream, will you?

518
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:03,793
No, I won't.

519
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:08,833
You won't leave me, even if
I don't dance well... will you?

520
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:10,536
No, I won't.

521
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:16,841
Not even if I call you names...
donkey, monkey... will you?

522
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,509
Of course, I won't.

523
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:24,846
You won't leave me, even if I tell you
that I love you... will you?

524
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:08,420
There she is...
still asleep!

525
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:12,461
Come on, Pooja!
It's seven in the morning!

526
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:14,796
The sun is up, Pooja.

527
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,783
What the hell...!

528
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:37,519
What are you up to, you idiot?
Is this the way to wake someone up?

529
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:41,862
I'm so sorry, but seeing you fast
asleep, I just couldn't resist it!

530
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:43,892
How could I miss out on
such an opportunity?

531
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:51,572
Listen, get ready quickly.
We've got to go to the airport.

532
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:53,875
Airport? Are you going somewhere?

533
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,911
No. WE are going somewhere.

534
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,614
WE? And where are we going?

535
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,814
Well, it's not far from India,
it's very near.

536
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,815
We'll return by tonight's flight.
Get ready quickly!

537
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,717
I can't understand a word
of what you're saying!

538
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:13,528
It's very simple.
I have to go on some business.

539
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:17,531
It will take me just an hour, just
sign some papers and then I am free.

540
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:21,863
If you come along, you'll see a new
city as well as do some shopping.

541
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:25,535
And anyway I am leaving for London
tomorrow. That leaves only today...

542
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,868
which I want to spend with you.

543
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:30,875
But Ajay, I must find out if
it's okay with Uncle and Aunty.

544
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:36,585
I've already got their approval.
It's only you who has to decide!

545
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,583
So fatty, are you coming or not?

546
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:40,915
- Of course, I am coming!
- Then hurry up and get ready.

547
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,958
- The flight is on time.
- Wait a minute...

548
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:45,586
- What's that under your eye?
- Where...?

549
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:48,960
Now wait, you fatty...!

550
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:51,867
Never mind.
I'll get you for this.

551
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:53,634
Come and get me.

552
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,868
You're going shopping, aren't you?
We'll see!

553
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:25,594
The heart is crazy,
the heart is mad.

554
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:29,938
The heart is crazy,
the heart is mad.

555
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:42,616
The very first time lovers meet,
it sets their bodies on fire.

556
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:51,627
Very slowly it teaches love, it makes
them laugh, and it makes them cry.

557
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:08,575
It keeps them awake all night, it
steals the sleep from their eyes

558
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:13,581
It shows true and false dreams...

559
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:17,580
it makes them laugh,
and it makes them cry.

560
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:09,727
Those who follow the heart
are known to be crazy

561
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:18,237
They discover their destination,
but cannot find the path.

562
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:44,330
I don't need to see his face,
I don't need to know his name either.

563
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:53,348
I don't need to think or worry,
because my heart will know him.

564
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:58,906
We all listen to what
the heart says...

565
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:03,281
the heart doesn't
listen to anyone,

566
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:10,792
I've given my life to him,
yet everyone knows, but he.

567
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:36,883
So be it, give up these stories,
all these signs of madness,

568
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:45,655
All people's worries are
all thanks to this crazy heart.

569
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:59,500
Well, Ajay Sahib...
it's time for you to go.

570
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:01,363
Now I have to go.

571
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,298
Did you say something?

572
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:07,374
Pooja, I want to say
something to you.

573
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,374
Say what you want to say.

574
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:15,417
This quick business trip of a couple
of days was all a pretence.

575
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:18,920
I came here for something else.

576
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:23,417
It's been eight years
since I left India.

577
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:26,460
In these years I've earned
enough of respect and money.

578
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:31,464
But life has been too hectic.
I want to settle down now.

579
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:35,966
And whenever I close my eyes...

580
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:38,967
to think whom I would like to spend
the rest of my life with...

581
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:43,477
it is always your face
that I see.

582
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:52,680
I don't know how or when my
feelings for you turned to love.

583
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:59,022
But I don't know anything
about your mind.

584
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:04,427
Or if there is anyone
in your life or not.

585
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,670
That is what I came here
to find out.

586
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:11,935
I don't know what
you think about me.

587
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:16,935
I don't even know if you would want
to spend your whole life with me.

588
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:23,951
But I know for sure that I love you
and I want to marry you.

589
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,993
I'm going towards
the departure gate.

590
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,202
Once I've got there I'll
turn round and look.

591
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:47,208
If your answer is yes, then
you'll be standing here.

592
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:52,206
And if you're not here
then I'll understand.

593
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:59,550
And one more thing. Don't forget
that whatever your decision is...

594
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:05,417
we were friends, we are friends,
and we'll always be friends.

595
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:24,512
And who knows, tomorrow
it may also happen to you.

596
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:29,175
Perhaps you will marry a man
whom you only know...

597
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:31,179
but whom you don't love.

598
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:34,447
Then you will realise later
that he was the man...

599
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,557
for whom you were waiting.

600
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:07,721
But why did you keep
standing there?

601
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:12,488
Sometimes I'm so happy when
I make someone else happy...

602
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:14,626
that I can't think
of anything else.

603
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:17,197
You should have
seen his face, Anjali!

604
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:21,469
He was so happy. I have never
seen him so happy ever before.

605
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:26,540
And your happiness?
You don't love him, Pooja!

606
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:38,219
Love will happen in due course
and we are Indian girls.

607
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:41,585
We can't choose our own husbands...

608
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:44,588
so someone else chooses
our husbands for us.

609
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:50,557
We learn to love them.
Isn't that true?

610
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:54,636
At last you have left your girlish
dreams and become a woman.

611
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:58,632
No, Anjali. The girl
has become a woman...

612
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:02,503
but she has not
given up her dreams.

613
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,510
She believes in them
completely, even now.

614
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:13,551
She is sure that Ajay is the one
for whom she was always waiting...

615
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:19,226
and perhaps it was HE who was
taking HIS time to show her.

616
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:22,593
I'm certain that Ajay will
make you very happy.

617
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:02,236
- Hi, doctor...
- There's no need to worry.

618
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:04,565
It's a small fracture.
She'll go home in a week or so.

619
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:07,571
I told you Nisha would start
dancing again in a week.

620
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:12,246
I was talking about going home,
not about dancing.

621
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:14,242
She won't be able to dance
for about three months.

622
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:16,247
Three months?
Yes, Rahul.

623
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:18,550
Her heel is very delicate.

624
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:21,781
If she doesn't take care then
this fracture could recur...

625
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:24,625
and it could be more serious.

626
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:28,295
Does she know this.
May I see her?

627
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:31,294
Of course. You don't
need my permission.

628
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:35,336
Whose going to get me
a cup of tea?

629
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:40,671
God! You won't learn to knock.

630
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:44,335
Don't give me a lecture. I have
something very important to discuss.

631
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:47,676
Okay, what is it?

632
01:09:47,883 --> 01:09:49,680
Can you see me properly?
How many fingers?

633
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:55,689
See, your Doctor Kapoor isn't up
to much, in my opinion.

634
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:58,349
Get a check-up with
another doctor.

635
01:09:58,494 --> 01:09:59,392
Why?

636
01:09:59,495 --> 01:10:01,395
This doctor was talking about
getting you discharged in a week.

637
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,621
- So what?
- No, no I can't allow this.

638
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:06,392
It's been difficult getting you
admitted into a hospital.

639
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:08,730
You should spend at least
a month or two in here.

640
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:11,737
And while you are away,
we'll also have some peace.

641
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:16,740
You're always making
fun of me. I hate you.

642
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,448
She has gone mad
with the pain...

643
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:31,493
I'm sorry that I've put you
to so much of trouble.

644
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,454
You've taken all the money
from the sponsor...

645
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:38,499
and how will you get
a dancer so quickly?

646
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:40,492
And for three months, I...

647
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:44,505
There's no need for you to worry.

648
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,838
Why do you think you're
such a good dancer?

649
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:50,844
In this town there are
many such dancers.

650
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,504
But you'll never get...

651
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:54,512
We'll never get
another dancer like you.

652
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,851
Now you don't worry about this.

653
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:00,750
You have a nice rest and I'll
come see you in the evening.

654
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:06,427
I'll bring some food.
We'll eat together.

655
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:20,906
Why are you worried?
It will all work out.

656
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:22,574
How will it all work out?

657
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,905
We've taken money from the sponsors
and paid a deposit for the stadium.

658
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:27,477
And most of all, where will we
get another dancer like Nisha?

659
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:30,618
Come on, friends, if we try, do you
think we can't find one good dancer?

660
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:32,821
These days there are
so many dance schools.

661
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:34,819
There is one close to
our rehearsal hall.

662
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:36,617
We'll find a dancer
there tomorrow.

663
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,691
How about that, Rahul?
Come on! Relax!

664
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,864
Whatever happens
will be for the best.

665
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:45,829
Let's go and have
some cold beer.

666
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,902
No, thanks. You go ahead.
I'm not in the mood.

667
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,906
Lay off, he's tired.
Come on, let's go.

668
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:02,947
Maya, I'll find her.

669
01:16:21,777 --> 01:16:25,713
Water, water...

670
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:30,217
The sandwich man!

671
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:32,720
Shanti... has a parcel
come here by mistake?

672
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:34,717
I haven't come for
a parcel today.

673
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,754
Then tell me what
I can do for you.

674
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:39,756
- I want to meet your daughter.
- I don't have a daughter.

675
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:41,327
- No daughter?
- No.

676
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:44,261
Then sir, this
Miss Pooja Malhotra...

677
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:49,264
Pooja is like my daughter.
But how do you know her?

678
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:51,270
I saw her last night.

679
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:54,774
Last night? Where?

680
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:57,472
In the dancing school.
She dances beautifully.

681
01:16:57,879 --> 01:17:00,211
- And so?
- So, I wanted to meet her.

682
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:02,943
- Why?
- I wanted to ask her something.

683
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:05,685
- What did you want to ask her?
- Sort of, would she, with me...

684
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:10,419
- With you... what?
- If she wanted to work with me.

685
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:11,724
What work?

686
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:14,227
I'm doing a play and I'm
looking for a dancer.

687
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:18,732
You are doing a play.
Are you a director?

688
01:17:19,534 --> 01:17:21,161
Yes. I am sorry.

689
01:17:21,336 --> 01:17:23,736
I am sorry! Why didn't you
say that in the first place?

690
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:25,305
I said so, when you asked me.

691
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:29,741
- Actually, I am a singer.
- I see.

692
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:31,742
I've done years of practice.

693
01:17:33,548 --> 01:17:36,745
As it happens with
many great artistes...

694
01:17:37,285 --> 01:17:39,276
you really don't meet
many connoisseurs.

695
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:43,390
You've met me today.
You don't know how lucky you are!

696
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:46,220
Sir, I have come to meet Pooja.

697
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:48,795
Now that you have met me,
you will meet Pooja, too!

698
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:51,329
I won't give you more
than seventy-five rupees.

699
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,333
Eighty rupees. No less.

700
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:58,839
Only last week I bought it
at that price.

701
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:02,210
This is the right price.
Taste it and see how sweet it is.

702
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:04,705
I will give you only
seventy-five Rupees.

703
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:08,214
- Show me the watermelon.
- Here you are, sir.

704
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:14,220
Seventy-five is the right price.
How many do you want, Madam?

705
01:18:14,556 --> 01:18:16,217
- Just one.
Pack this for Madam.

706
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:17,857
But...

707
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:21,260
It's your first sale in the day.
And you're haggling for 5 bucks!

708
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:23,296
Be a sport!

709
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:35,305
Recognise me? We met last night
at your dancing school. Remember?

710
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:39,813
You must have heard of me?

711
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:42,408
- No.
- Well, never mind.

712
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:46,319
Actually you are
a pretty good dancer.

713
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:52,825
Actually, I'm doing some music shows
and I need a special dancer...

714
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:57,354
for a special role. When I saw you
dancing yesterday...

715
01:18:57,966 --> 01:19:00,764
I thought that you would be
ideal for this.

716
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:05,773
So what do you think?
Would you be interested?

717
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:10,276
- No thanks.
- I've had it!

718
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,781
Damn the watermelon!
My career's at stake!

719
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:19,285
Excuse me, but perhaps
you misunderstand me.

720
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,819
I'm talking to you about
no ordinary show.

721
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:26,818
It's a very high-class show with
a very high-class audience...

722
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:30,824
and I am sure you will also enjoy
doing it. Why don't you try it once?

723
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:35,830
I'm a dancer.

724
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:40,339
But I am afraid of dancing on stage
in front of an audience.

725
01:19:40,542 --> 01:19:42,874
- Why are you afraid?
- I don't think I can do it.

726
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:53,887
Excuse me, I'm sorry,
but you see...

727
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:55,388
I'm really in difficulty.

728
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:57,422
The thing is that my lead dancer
has fractured her foot...

729
01:19:57,559 --> 01:19:59,424
and I've already taken all
the money for the show.

730
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:01,426
Now if the show does not go on, not
only will I suffer monetarily...

731
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:03,500
but my reputation will
take a big blow.

732
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:04,931
Please just once come
to the rehearsal hall...

733
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:07,263
and if you don't want to,
you don't have to do the show.

734
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:09,437
But please, just once...
please come to the rehearsal.

735
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,440
You'll have to take someone else.

736
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:19,445
You don't know that
I'm a very stubborn man.

737
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:22,445
- What are you up to?!
- I'll not go until you agree.

738
01:20:22,616 --> 01:20:24,447
Please come just once
to a rehearsal.

739
01:20:24,552 --> 01:20:26,452
Everyone's looking at us.

740
01:20:27,054 --> 01:20:28,988
- Promise you'll come?
- I'll come. Promise.

741
01:20:29,356 --> 01:20:30,948
- What time?
- At two O'clock.

742
01:20:31,358 --> 01:20:32,985
- Can you come at one?
- Okay, I'll come at one.

743
01:20:36,597 --> 01:20:39,000
You know that we are
neighbors, don't you?
