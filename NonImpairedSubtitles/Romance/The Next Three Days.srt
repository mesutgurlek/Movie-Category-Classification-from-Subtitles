The Next Three Days

3
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,300
Take me to the hospital, please!

4
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,890
I can not breathe.

5
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:22,120
Three years

6
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,850
You know something? If you have the spirit
you never talk nonsense.

7
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,960
Give me the costs.

8
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,610
You know a woman should not
you have never worked for another woman.

9
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,500
- How can you say something like that?
- Because they are constantly threatened.

10
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,570
Especially if she is beautiful
and the other is ugly.

11
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,350
Wonderful! And your leader
He never threatened not?

12
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,660
Ever, and you know why?
Because her man.

13
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,450
Erythema, please shortest you and me.

14
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,330
I just want to go home
and kiss my baby. My dear ...

15
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,050
See, you really need to keep the names mentioned
you have a child, and we have not.

16
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,050
- What I meant.
- Yes, but none of these words ...

17
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,660
Do not apologize, it's genetic.

18
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,650
Women are in a tournament continues.
That's why you have problems with your boss.

19
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,680
- Because it's a woman.
- Exactly.

20
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:16,970
Women should work with men,
men and women. Is the solution.

21
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,540
- And men with men?
- And back and a. They are common Nuith it.

22
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,900
- You do not want to go?
- You do not want something to drink?

23
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,960
May we be a force.

24
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,620
- Double, right?
- Men can do amazing things.

25
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,440
And I'm like, I know. But even if I
and does the job for me.

26
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,520
There really agree with you.
Good Night, Mick.

27
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,570
- You are a bad mood.
- He's right, my brothers!

28
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,730
I prefer to work and
with you than with her.

29
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,180
Very nice!
And I prefer to work with him.

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,450
- Do you prefer to "work" with John?
- No, it's not convenient Thi?

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,410
No! Why I would not mind
your sexual innuendo bit?

32
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,800
- What happened to you this evening?
- You mean something?

33
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,160
If you do advances
My husband against me?

34
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,920
Lara, if wants him and your husband
him and have a look and a.

35
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,300
- How? Maybe if you show her breasts and more.
- You know that's your problem?

36
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,800
My problem is that you have breasts
above in mind!

37
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,060
They are huge! It

38
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,730
- Maybe if you had another brain!
- Honey, calm down!

39
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,560
- Good night, Brother Bear!
- Good night!

40
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,830
- He is a liar.
- Do not try to calm me down!

41
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,500
I did not even
his dentist.

42
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,660
Shut up!

43
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,750
Maybe you do not know
how to write "anesthetist."

44
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,000
- This woman is a crook.
- I went to his party, stupid!

45
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,000
I think he wanted to give me
like last time.

46
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,770
Ithier vain illusions. Not even
Thi has not made sexual advances.

47
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,960
- I do not wear it!
- I understand. I'm serious! I know how it is

48
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,730
People like him
would be allowed to transact orally.

49
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,950
You're a moron!

50
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,100
You put on your seat, trying to stay calm

51
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,700
and "stuff" you hit on the forehead ...

52
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,850
Rendezvous next weekend.

53
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,930
- Okay.
- Bye!

54
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,400
- Good night!
- Bye!

55
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,700
- Bye!
- Bye!

56
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,860
Damn!

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,100
- You say you started.
- Give it up!

58
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,230
- Super!
- A small resort apropiaþi.

59
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,830
You can not do this every morning.
It is downright ordinary.

60
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,280
Come zâmbiþi!

61
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,521
Only until they reach age 18 and older.

62
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,550
- A gift.
- Splendid!

63
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,840
- What is it?
- Thi-s do not brush their teeth.

64
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,200
Periuþa teeth that wash Ithier
in 30 seconds.

65
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,910
Like brushing my teeth.
Do not listen to what mama said, mind.

66
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,300
- When multiple classes of arrival?
- Three hours.

67
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,000
But we need to correct certain documents.
We can help you Luke?

68
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,200
After yesterday, you probably have remained
unemployed. He and so ...

69
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,510
You think I exaggerate
when I told him that a cow?

70
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,400
I think I'm happy to head
This frank exchange of opinions.

71
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,400
- Have you called your father?
- When?

72
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Yesterday, on his birthday.

73
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,660
Yes, I sent a bouquet of roses
and a map made by my mânuþa.

74
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,280
And I finished the sewing
and coverage.

75
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,450
You're impossible.

76
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,850
You've seen what we've received this year
my birthday? I get a grunt.

77
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,760
My mother said: "In many years, baby!"
and my father ...

78
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,930
It was the happiest moment of my life.
They gave me tears, nothing else.

79
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,000
Have you ever thought that someone should
to be more mature in such situations?

80
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,860
I want to tell you that memory
the custody hearing.

81
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,080
How it all the time nannies and mother you dad.
Yes? "You'll remember that?

82
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,570
You how you feel when Luke
will grow and will not call you on your birthday?

83
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,540
- Now try to divide us.
- I give up!

84
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,450
And now, you give up.

85
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,350
Are you ready?
They line up.

86
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,130
Now they are aligned.
You tell me when you start.

87
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,160
Give it up!

88
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,550
Open it!

89
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,590
- Police! Your wife is stopped.
- Why stop?

90
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,700
- Is accused of murder.
- Hey, hey! Little station!

91
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,830
- Laura Brennan?
- If you touch me one time, you under arrest!

92
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,860
Stay there!

93
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,670
- Keep the place!
- This is my house!

94
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,870
- Lara Brennan?
- Yes!

95
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,910
Can I ask you something?

96
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,440
You are arrested for murder
Gesas Elizabeth.

97
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,950
- Calm down!
- I want to take my baby!

98
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,630
- Sir, what are you doing? Put him and handcuff them!
- But what is happening here?

99
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,450
- Mom!
- John!

100
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,300
Honey, I am committed to a lawyer.

101
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,610
- It's okay, baby! It does not matter!
- Do not touch me!

102
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,060
Mom!

103
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,740
Luke! It does not matter!
It does not matter!

104
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,490
Dad! Dad!

105
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,150
- Papa!
- What? What happened?

106
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,960
You can sleep here

107
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,920
as long as you stay on your side of the bed.
We understood?

108
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,800
And mecherule!

109
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,300
I do not know why I always fooled.

110
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,000
Or maybe, I pretend I do not know.

111
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,880
Hey!

112
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,696
Lie. Sleep.

113
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,960
- Sam is your friend, you do?
- When it comes to food, not really.

114
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,650
- Ithier steal food?
- No.

115
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,650
- He spoke ill of Mom?
- Yes.

116
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,960
- Have you beaten?
- Yes.

117
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,100
Well.

118
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,980
- Where did you beat?
- On the playground.

119
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,500
- Wow! I think it hurts.
- Yes.

120
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,518
Wait a bit, and children.

121
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,600
It's a toy.

122
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,650
Thank you!

123
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,300
Mânuþa Give me that,
her.

124
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,100
Do not worry about me and inuþã,
retrieve it later.

125
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,820
Hello!

126
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,800
Hey, baby!

127
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,400
N-Mom a kiss?

128
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,880
- Come on, kiss her mother.
- Angry, my mother a kiss.

129
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,370
- Thi-Daddy read my letters?
- Every night at bedtime.

130
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,500
Yes?

131
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,950
How nice! He and Miro
Today, what you build?

132
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,480
Build your own castle?

133
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,050
What's this?
A castle gate?

134
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,100
I was afraid to go to school?

135
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,110
No. I went to class, and not embraced
and even turned his head to greet me.

136
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,600
Look at his friends!

137
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,900
Bãncuþa and years.

138
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,420
- When you how was your first day?
- Super!

139
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,180
Half of the class
did not sleep, you know.

140
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,670
- I talked to your mother.
- When it comes to see me?

141
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,810
He is busy with her business.
He and so ...

142
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:12,050
I have been a few years
are safe and I'll come here.

143
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,900
- Have you heard anything?
- About the call?

144
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:23,850
Yes, but do not say anything.
Bring Thi remember what Meyer says.

145
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,530
- Do not ...
- It could take several months

146
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,160
until a court decides.

147
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,200
I saw this woman. He was there.
He had to disappear and how, suddenly.

148
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,400
- Meyer will find another investigator.
- And the clothes in my bag agatha.

149
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,480
I heard that I skipped a button
to be blind not to find it.

150
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,800
We re-evaluate all the evidence.

151
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,330
It's great!
Because we are not yet faliþi.

152
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,950
- We can cope.
- Minds all the time.

153
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,030
But you are very beautiful.

154
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,040
Sorry!

155
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,280
- You do me a favor?
- I do not know, are very busy.

156
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,850
I want to run
for the post of governor.

157
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,060
I think I can help.

158
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,120
Maybe you're successful and change the rules
conjugal visits,

159
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,580
because I do not know if more
about 20 years.

160
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,860
Hey!

161
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,130
I'm fine. I'm fine.

162
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,750
Everything will be fine. I promise!

163
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,200
You think he wants
you ever kiss me?

164
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,850
Stand up, please.

165
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,450
Leap and Ah!

166
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,130
You're next.

167
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,950
Luke! Let's go.
We'll be late.

168
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,820
- Did you have fun?
- Yes.

169
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's a little crazy about that girl you?

170
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,750
Have to go, Carrie!

171
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,800
No!

172
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,900
Read what you write there.
We must make a decision ...

173
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,600
What happens if they find
Women who left the parking lot?

174
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,550
Appeal was dismissed.

175
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,050
- We can not present other evidence.
- It was a holdup!

176
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,760
And if I use a credit card
we can say that.

177
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,900
Sorry.

178
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,150
It's crazy!

179
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,950
All Rights Reserved.
So we have no choice.

180
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,750
All you can do is call
Supreme Court, and you?

181
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,100
John, over the past 30 years, the Supreme Court
has not even solved a murder case.

182
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,400
No decent lawyer
not one to call.

183
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,650
Thus, A and all I have to do
ask a lawyer "indecent."

184
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,480
It would be very difficult to find.

185
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll handle this.

186
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:19,450
- But I want to do something for me and you.
- What?

187
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,100
I want to analyze samples,
but remember that your wife Lara.

188
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,500
We have seen evidence, Meyer.

189
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:33,510
Thi not to judge the criminals
or innocent, but to analyze the samples.

190
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,311
An officer saw her
when he left the scene,

191
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,500
victim had blood on his clothes
and fingerprints on murder weapon ...

192
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,200
I took it out for dinner in town!

193
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,600
How could you do
after killing someone?

194
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,290
- Must be a psychopath!
- And the fight ...

195
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,550
- Lara is not psycho!
- Fight in the office?

196
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,560
- Everyone is and fight with their heads!
- But that ended with a crime.

197
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:56,350
There and then, you say you do not think
I never that innocent?

198
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,850
- How can you say something like that?
- What do you mean?

199
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:03,370
I want to say that no matter what we believe
Lara was a child to escape from the cavity!

200
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,500
You do not know how I hate to say it.

201
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,450
You will find someone else
for appeal.

202
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,350
John. John!
Be serious! John!

203
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,700
John!
For the love of God!

204
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,300
Come.
See for Scouting.

205
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:37,050
Let's hug eZi Peng
Micuþul Peng,

206
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:42,080
Kiki and Opossumy.
With lots and lots of love, Mom.

207
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,160
You do not want to write about us?

208
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,700
- I have 25 cents?
- To give you 25 cents?

209
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,700
Yes, but you allowed them to spend it all.

210
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:01,200
Where is the remote that me and mom
We pick you up when you were a baby and you.

211
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,000
- Can I take them all?
- Sure.

212
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,780
My wife, Lara Brennan
was sent here.

213
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,290
B-R-E-N-N-A-N. You have to see!

214
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,500
- Sorry!
- Lara! Lara!

215
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,850
You can not go there!

216
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,050
- No you do here!
- Turn it up! Come back!

217
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,090
- What do you do, sir?
- Lara!

218
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,150
- Come here!
- Lara!

219
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,880
- Sir!
- But what is happening here?

220
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,400
My wife tried to commit suicide!
He was brought here. You have to see, please!

221
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,480
- It is allowed to receive visitors.
- Why the Emergency Room?

222
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,990
- He was transferred to the prison.
- Only two minutes, please!

223
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,550
Two minutes.

224
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,650
Well.

225
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,150
Thank you.

226
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,300
Two minutes.

227
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,304
"Life and Adventures of Don Quixote."

228
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,100
What's this?

229
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:55,600
About the fact that faith in the virtue
But it is more important than virtue?

230
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,450
Yes, it says in the book.

231
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,600
But what is it?

232
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:06,390
It could be about
Ithier soul-destroying rational thought.

233
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,100
Or the triumph iraþionalitãþii
and the power that lies within her.

234
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,450
We lose a lot of time
try to organize the world.

235
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:19,930
Manufacturing by clocks, calendars,
weather forecasting.

236
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,720
What part of our lives
is really under our control?

237
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,300
What happens if we choose to run
facing the reality that surrounds us?

238
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,760
Prisons GUIDE

239
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,300
It would be a total madness.

240
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,150
What would be probably better
a life full of hopelessness.

241
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,220
BEYOND THE WALLS
Damon Pennington

242
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,300
This is a course they need people
than to be free, regardless of cost.

243
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,050
For another teacher
i was put on the spot "Butterfly".

244
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:23,150
Listen, you've missed
seven times in prison.

245
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,300
And what do you want to know?

246
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,000
How have you managed to escape when
does anyone else managed this?

247
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,450
I took courage and a little luck.

248
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,400
All prisons in the world
"Weaknesses".

249
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,200
Everyone has a key.
You only have one finds you.

250
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,200
How did you do?

251
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,000
I looked closely. Especially when things
who were not part of daily routine.

252
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,550
The guards are common Nuith
and doing these things every day.

253
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:50,700
And they make mistakes, what happens.
When you see this, you must be prepared.

254
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,700
You need to have everything well prepared plan
even before you decide to escape.

255
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:00,250
Escape is a breeze,
the hardest part is to remain free.

256
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,020
You need to know where to go
and how.

257
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,950
Need to know when they plan
to take, how and where.

258
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,850
- How on earth can you find these things?
- You pay someone who knows.

259
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,750
And if the prison is very important
is in the province or city.

260
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,100
He is in town.

261
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,950
- How are you?
- From Pittsburgh.

262
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,750
Pittsburgh is a city difficult,

263
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:41,450
with many bridges and tunnels
which can be easily blocked.

264
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,310
Once they received a call

265
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,920
Police may close the downtown
and to isolate it completely in 15 minutes.

266
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,700
How can I be so for exacþi?

267
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,950
In the wake of 9 / 11
Homeland Security has decided that each city

268
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,600
to have a safety plan:

269
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,400
downtown Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Boston,
Minneapolis to close in 15 minutes.

270
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,850
They can become "dead zones"
within 10 minutes.

271
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,650
And 35 minutes each border point
between states will be guarded by police

272
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,460
and all secondary roads will be closed.

273
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,970
If you do not take a picture with you,
Your description will be detailed.

274
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,250
- And if I do not fit in 30 minutes?
- Then, you teach.

275
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,560
Because the site will draw on
you and those who are with you.

276
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,330
Stay away from stations
and bus stations.

277
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,450
Look for local airports.
Escape to another state.

278
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,400
The second thing: identity.
It is easy to obtain false documents,

279
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,110
but it is difficult to obtain documents
you can pass control of the airport.

280
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,900
Need a passport book
management and social insurance.

281
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:37,200
If you rent a car
Find a place where you can pay in cash.

282
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,400
Will check the books of credit and thus,
for acts uses a real name.

283
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,460
The third thing: the destination.

284
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,180
You must go to a place
not attract American tourists.

285
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,800
Remember to Yemen
and I know what I mean.

286
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,900
Second, money.
You need a truck of money.

287
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,600
All hotels are expensive,
travel information.

288
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,130
For how much money do I need?

289
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,550
Both come to tell you how
at least five or six years.

290
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,970
If you're short of money, short of friends.

291
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:10,350
But before you do something, you must
ask if you are able to do so.

292
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,000
You can get to say goodbye to parents
because I never see more.

293
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,950
Can you kill a guard, you can thi
abandon your child in a gas station

294
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
or if you are slammed on the ground a little old lady
Nice that stands in your way Thi?

295
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:25,380
Because if you want to do
things, he and the future.

296
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:31,450
And if you're not in this state
does not start, because someone will be killed.

297
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,000
What is your sin?

298
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,950
I willingly surrendered.

299
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,850
I never thought I supported him to find
and waits on the threshold of the door of the bedroom.

300
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,000
So how much money you have in your pocket?

301
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,000
Good luck!

302
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,880
3 months

303
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,650
All prisons in the world have "weaknesses".

304
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,760
Everyone has a key.
You only have one finds you.

305
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,400
How did you do?

306
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,300
I looked closely. Especially when things

465
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,100
No, not about that.

466
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,050
E jail.

467
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,600
- I said that too many people.
- I understand.

468
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:00,350
He is innocent.
I killed a woman on it.

469
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,950
Well.

470
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,600
I'm sure she did not kill her.

471
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,400
I think it would be better to go home.

472
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,800
Well.

473
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,700
Thank you for the invitation.
We'll try to come.

474
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,600
- It would be great.
- Bye.

475
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,400
- Luke
- Bye!

476
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,850
Come.

477
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,150

- Hello!
- Hello!

484
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,700
What happened?

485
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:58,700
What?

486
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:08,300
No!

487
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,750
I can not move without you announce.

488
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:13,900
Three days are not sufficient.

489
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:18,100
I was there when I filed the appeal.
I knew that I go to jail.

490
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,040

We must resolve by tomorrow.

492
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:28,750
The title is not very clear.
We can not ...

493
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,660
- How can I give?
- Nothing!

494
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:02,800
- What research here?
- I hours.

495
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:07,150
Be good, yes?

496
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,780
Thank you.

497
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,000
Shit!

498
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:26,450
- You happened to you?
- What are you doing? He was killing us!

499
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,800
- I'm sorry!
- You're crazy! Do not forget where you going?

500
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:33,250
Get away!
Leave us alone!

501
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:06,850
Hello!

502
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,800
- What happened?
- Nothing.

503
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:17,400
- There was something wrong with Luke?
- No.

504
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:18,700
What?

505
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:26,950
I asked Meyer to do something
do you get out of here.

506
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:33,140
I said I would be very difficult
for us to travel so much,

507
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:34,780
and Luke and which must have enough problems
at school, what he really

508
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:37,550
because I spent
enough time with him.

509
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,300
- I spent enough time with him?
- No.

510
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,700
You never dealt fairly by him?

511
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,900
Jesus! John.

512
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:51,150
This time around, even exaggerating.

513
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:55,600
Luke welcomes you because the weights
his mother is in prison for murder,

514
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:58,710
not because his father
I spent enough time with him.

515
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:03,550
Your father was right. You are life
in a different world from ours.

516
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,250
It is good that you say you
and you in business.

517
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,700
- I live in the world, Lara?
- I do not know John, but not true.

518
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,900
I'll spend the rest of my life here

519
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:19,010
and you want to believe
I do not know this fantasy in which he did not ...

520
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,400
It is everything okay?

521
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:26,100
Yes. Sorry!

522
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,750
And now, with a face that time on,
I want you for your leaves.

523
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,370
What do you want to do
You want to make you feel better?

524
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:44,900
I understand!

525
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,550
- Sorry.
- Ithier apologize?

526
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:51,500
- You are a true gem!
- What do you want me, Lara?

527
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:55,510
What I want from you?
Nothing. Already you're too perfect!

528
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,700
You never asked me
so I did.

529
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:01,200
- If we really killed.
- Because I know I killed you.

530
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,420
Then, you and Eli.

531
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,250
I'm done.

532
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:54,400
Mr. President, did you leave the station there.

533
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,400
Sir!

534
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,850
Sir!

535
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:17,700
- What?
- Shut up!

536
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,250
I do not care what you say and how you say it.

537
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,790
I do not think you did something like that.

538
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,650
I do not believe it.

539
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,750
I know who you are.

540
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,960
I promise you that ...

541
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:43,000
one to tell you not to spend life and a.

542
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,000
Shut up!

543
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,170
- What happened to my merchandise?
- I know you?

544
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:08,200
How dare I not Trimithi?

545
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,550
Move as you! Back!

546
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:12,960
Back!

547
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:17,060
- This time both of them!
- Shoot the dog!

548
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:19,500
- Take your dog here!
- If your dog shoot, kill!

549
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:22,600
- Police want to come here, asshole!
- Good idea!

550
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:25,200
- Take the dog out of here!
- That he was shot!

551
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:26,610
Paint it!

552
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:28,735
- Enter and you there!
- I'm not going there!

553
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:30,100
Go ahead!

554
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,520
Go! Go there!

555
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:35,850
Close!
Close with the!

556
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,550
- Move!
- You're a dead man!

557
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,350
- I have done nothing!
- Did you bring me here!

558
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,050
I never did!

559
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,200
Put your knees!
Down!

560
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,700
Where are the prices?

561
01:05:58,050 --> 01:06:00,450
Here. I hope to be helpful.

562
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:03,850
- Where are the others?
- Here, take them to everyone.

563
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,600
- Where the money Ithier different?
- Wait until I give you money, yes.

564
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:08,900
- I shot C!
- You can not pull that not even a dog.

565
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:10,560
- We kill them both!
- No, I'll kill you both!

566
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:13,220
- Give them money!
- Shut up, zdreanþã!

567
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:15,970
Give them money!
Jesus! you stop!

568
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,200
See?
You are not able to kill me.

569
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,650
That's all you can do?

570
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:30,750
Go home. I'll come get you
and I'll kill you.

571
01:06:39,277 --> 01:06:41,177
Waste and your kindness of spirit.

572
01:06:41,412 --> 01:06:43,912
Yes, good things.
Contains a large amount of alcohol.

573
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:52,200
- What do you do, give me fire?
- Yes.

574
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:54,450
- That I will do.
- Jesus Christ!

575
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:56,510
This is a drug lab, you idiot!

576
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,600
No, it was.

577
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,650
- Phooey!
- Where is the money?

578
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,600
My baby is upstairs!

579
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:06,750
My baby is upstairs!

580
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:10,570
Arise! Arise!

581
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:35,500
Please!
Let me go! Please!

582
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:15,350
Anyone there?

583
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:43,550
Do not leave me here!

584
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,050
I do not want to die here!

585
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:52,100
Please!

586
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:28,650
Take me to the hospital, please!

587
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:32,150
I can not breathe!

588
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,700
Please!

589
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,850
I can not breathe!

590
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:06,300
Give yourself a hand.

591
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,750
- What have we here?
- A strange miracle.

592
01:11:13,818 --> 01:11:16,350
The basement is a drug lab,
and the house is still standing.

593
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:19,030
- Must be a crater there.
- We know who is the victim?

594
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:22,750
Alex Gaidar. He was known to history
violence and drug trafficking.

595
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:33,100
Can a child?

596
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:37,500
His neighbor said his wife left him
last year. Once there, surprise!

597
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:40,172
Blood that here ...

598
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,450
to know who owns it?

599
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:46,350
No, but it seems that someone who was bleeding
it out through the back door,

600
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:50,160
and in District 3, on a bench next to the passage
we found a victim who was shot and how much.

601
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,900
- I came to pick up Luke.
- Your son is asleep.

602
01:12:43,307 --> 01:12:45,507
Yes, we got Luke to take him home.

603
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,000
John!

604
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:58,450
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

605
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:11,850
Hey, chicken and the city.
Wake up, you go home.

606
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,900
- How do you say?
- Thanks, Mom!

607
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:19,050
Go fuck her grandmother.

608
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:21,030
- I'm too tired to give them more kisses.
- Baby!

609
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,800
There is no problem.

610
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:25,050
O give me many kisses
next week.

611
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:29,700
We want to take the Harvest Festival
Kutztown, see Clydesdale cãluþii.

612
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,500
- Goodbye!
- Bye!

613
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:38,650
Bye!

614
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:41,450
Hey!

615
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:47,250
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye!

616
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:04,950
Goodbye!

617
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,900
- Bye, Mom!
- Bye!

618
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:42,700
- At bãtrâneþe become sentimental.
- Yes, the so-i.

619
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:47,850
Me and someone serves me a coffee?

620
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:12,050
Hey, idioþilor!

621
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,900
Can I take it and him?

622
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:20,900
No, baby.
Everything that goes in the backpack.

623
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:29,150
- But in your pockets?
- Or in the pocket.

624
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:56,350
Hello!

625
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:59,800
Hello?

626
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:25,550
Hey, chicken and the city!
I'll be back soon, yes?

627
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:27,050
Well.

628
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,250
Baby.

629
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:03,450
A and a.

630
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:07,600
- You okay?
- Yes.

631
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:15,150
See where spending occurs.
Yield 922, street.

632
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:17,600
What would you say?
Do you agree?

633
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:19,450
Here we go.

634
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,600
Stop all models
The Prius did in 2004-2009.

635
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:42,640
What's killer and that
driving a Prius?

636
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:44,650
A very responsible
socially?

637
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:47,950
The city has recorded more than a thousand
Prius and sites throughout the state, about seven miles.

638
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:50,150
How many have been recorded
on behalf of criminals?

639
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:55,300
The statewide, six. Four crook
evazioni're or a rapist and murderer.

640
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:58,200
- Start with the murderer.
- Is in jail for the rest of life.

641
01:19:58,450 --> 01:20:00,350
The rapist is free.

642
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:05,080
it finds.

643
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:14,400
- Hi!
- Hello!

644
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:17,100
- Glad to see you.
- And us.

645
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:23,700
- Hi, Luke.
- It's a pony.

646
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,900
Gifts are packed.

647
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,730
You know the party starts
11:00, you?

648
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,500
Really? Read more carefully
what is written on invitation.

649
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:36,950
There is no problem. Why do not you
give her gift to Carrie?

650
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,700
- I think you could help me.
- Actually, I must go. I have something to do.

651
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:47,050
Sorry.

652
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,250
Then you will see later.

653
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:53,700
Thank you very much.

654
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:56,600
Hey ...

655
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:02,300
Is the phone number
the jacket of my parents,

656
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:04,350
the top pocket of his jacket.

657
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:08,510
Where the end.

658
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:11,150
No problem.

659
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:23,750
The rapist is in a wheelchair.
I do not know if it was karma or bad luck.

660
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,800
Criminal ...
Where is incarcerated?

661
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,800
In state prison,
here in town.

662
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:31,350
She has a husband or an adult child
I could drive a car?

663
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:47,900
- Yes. What?
- Lara Brennan blood tests.

664
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:52,950
Get me to the lab.

665
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,700
You angry against someone, it is clear.

666
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,450
- Busy, try again.
- No.

667
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:13,300
Call the ambulance, one to go
University Hospital. Appointment there.

668
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:17,100
All Rights Reserved. Thank you.

669
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:20,300
- Her husband is a teacher.
- You know the address where she lives?

670
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,400
There is no car in the garage.
Want to ask a warrant?

671
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:28,850
Yes.

672
01:23:57,550 --> 01:23:59,250
Do you in the office!

673
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:43,100
Lara Brennan is transferred
University Hospital.

674
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:44,850
- Right now?
- Yes.

675
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:46,750
Call them and tell them ambulance escort.

676
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,400
Tell them that we meet in hospital
in 10 minutes.

677
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,700
Yes! Yes, we agree.

678
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:57,650
Location: it's not serious.
There is no problem, sir.

679
01:24:58,150 --> 01:24:59,650
The so-us.

680
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:03,150
- Hands Up!
- John!

681
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,650
Give me the phone.

682
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:07,650
- What are you doing here, John?
- Hold your hands up!

683
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,650
- John! What are you doing here?
- Let the handcuffs.

684
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,150
Sit!

685
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:14,950
John stops you!

686
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:17,550
Sit down with the front wall.

687
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,420
Washing police at the entrance waiting for you ...

688
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:26,800
- He just said that ...
- Do not stop at traffic lights.

689
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:33,650
Tie his hands and feet
close as you can.

690
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:36,550
If you leave out of here with him
I'll kill you both.

691
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,350
- Stop the silence Thi!
- John, he's right.

692
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:41,850
Listen to him. You will die here.
Why do this?

693
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:43,140
Because we have no other choice!

694
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:44,700
- Dress up!
- No, not really!

695
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:45,870
- Dress up.
- No!

696
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,380
- Now!
- No!

697
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:49,250
Well.

698
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:52,550
Tell your son.
Tell him you do not want to live.

699
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,250
- It's Where?
- You wait.

700
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:56,600
- You tell him you do not want to live?
- Why do this to me?

701
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:59,300
Click "send".
Tell him that I return without you.

702
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:02,650
- John ...
- You think you can come back to me, Lara?

703
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:08,000
Call him. Tell anyone who has not
and mom and dad do not come back!

704
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,150
Jesus! John ...

705
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:13,750
You're an idiot.

706
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:26,800
I'm Dr. Lifson.

707
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:29,250
I have a patient who was transferred
a prison, Lara Brennan.

708
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:32,950
Yes, I used initially
20 units of insulin.

709
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,900
Security!

710
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:51,950
Security!

711
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:56,350
Out! Exit the elevator!

712
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,090
Back!

713
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:25,500
- Hey, do not be silly.
- Back!

714
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:27,050
We have people at each exit, John.

715
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:28,510
You'll both be shot and move the
If you try to go.

716
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:29,870
- Press the button!
- Sit there!

717
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:32,730
- Press the button!
- John, no!

718
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:35,450
- Where are the stairs?
- Il.

719
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:39,200
Look in the parking lot of a man
and a woman in white coats!

720
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,560
- Please, please ...
- Everything will be fine.

721
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:45,400
Look at me. Look at me!

722
01:27:45,450 --> 01:27:50,310
Everything will be fine. Do what you say
and they tell you and everything will be fine.

723
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:53,600
Lara! Show below Thi dress.

724
01:27:58,050 --> 01:28:00,500
It does not matter.
You stay here.

725
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:14,800
- Guard and your door!
- Okay.

726
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:48,650
Stop!

727
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,800
Shit!

728
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:52,850
Someone at the entrance?

729
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:58,400
Hey, listen!
Someone at the entrance?

730
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:14,700
Do not look.

731
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:19,650
Run!

732
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,600

Move as you!

735
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:33,050
Get away!

736
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:45,550
Over here!

737
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:09,747
- Look around you!
- Detach Thi hair.

738
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:16,800
Phooey!

739
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:20,650

01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,400

Attention, be-close the doors!

746
01:31:40,650 --> 01:31:42,250
Move! Police!

747
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:45,700
I want to stop the train
with 47 number.

748
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:47,300
Switch it up!

749
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:39,700
Hold on to me.
Hey, kid! Hold on tight.

You send them the description of the State Police.

754
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:20,790
I understand!

755
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,500
- How old is your child?
- Six.

756
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:25,100
To find out where it is

757
01:34:29,950 --> 01:34:32,300
- Why do not you say?
- You stopped.

758
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:35,000
Thi and I had personal things.

759
01:34:35,010 --> 01:34:37,800
You have a makeup kit,
creams, tooth periuþã ...

760
01:34:37,810 --> 01:34:40,410
Everything you've got there were old.
Hope and one that should be taken.

761
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,900
Bring Thi remember where you saw it.

762
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:55,180
Would you guess that escaped're
prison?

763
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:56,500
Wait a bit.

764
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,450
- Hello.
- Good. I came for my son.

765
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:06,350
Not yet returned.

766
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:10,350
- How to return?
- The zoo.

767
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,500
Part of the zoo.

768
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:19,050
About an hour would have to return.
Can you expect if you want.

769
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:20,700
No. Thank you.

770
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:27,050
What happened?
When Luke?

771
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:30,150
- Where is he? When Luke?
- It is a party.

772
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,000
What party?
You said it is a party.

773
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:35,280
I could be wrong.

Carrie mother. Nicole.

779
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:09,000
Ask neighbors if they noticed
something strange in recent days.

780
01:39:36,650 --> 01:39:39,550
It does not matter. I have no words to say thank you
because you took care of him.

781
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,450
We really enjoyed it.

782
01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:07,850
Hello!

783
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:41,200
And I'll stay here, OK?

784
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:44,800
Sure.

785
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:27,250
Traffic is blocked until the customs declaration.

786
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:30,070
The city center and for worse.
Police blocked all stations

787
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:34,650
and checks on all his travels and
însoþitorii them, as well as luggage ...

788
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:35,710
John!

789
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:36,770
... I checked all the cars ...

790
01:41:39,950 --> 01:41:41,500
What do we do?

791
01:41:51,650 --> 01:41:53,650
We go to the station.

792
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:36,050
- Station in the car.
- Okay.

793
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:22,800
Sir, I am sorry that the post late,
but I told them to stop all the washing machines.

794
01:43:22,850 --> 01:43:25,050
Only those in which the
a couple with one child.

795
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,200
Mr. Speaker, I know why ...

796
01:43:28,850 --> 01:43:30,350
Yes, sir.

797
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:08,840
Are you sure that's enough
$ 20?

798
01:44:08,850 --> 01:44:11,750
A ticket to Buffalo
it costs three times more.

799
01:44:11,850 --> 01:44:15,350
Yes. It's a way to save money.

800
01:45:13,350 --> 01:45:16,650
Go and send their images in all countries,
bus stations and airports,

801
01:45:16,660 --> 01:45:18,460
a radius of 500 km.

802
01:45:18,650 --> 01:45:22,010
So in Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia
New York, New Jersey,

803
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:24,490
Virginia, Michigan, Kentucky and Indiana?

804
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:27,500
You know the direction
will, isteaþo?

805
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:39,550
- Goodbye!
- Thank you again!

806
01:45:53,650 --> 01:45:56,700
- And you want to see the map?
- Only if you tell me where I am.

807
01:45:56,900 --> 01:45:58,400
You lucky.

808
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:21,650
Sorry.
This coffee you appointed?

809
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:31,050
How many airports are in Ontario and Quebec?

810
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:33,600
Let a little sun slowly
And start counting?

811
01:46:34,570 --> 01:46:36,540
On how long the road
few have all kinds of baggage.

812
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:37,600
What?

813
01:46:37,650 --> 01:46:39,950
Travel too far.
And now, you just check?

814
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:43,900
You know how many times we lost baggage?

815
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:47,750
You have tickets here
and boarding passes.

816
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:50,350
Thank you.

817
01:46:53,350 --> 01:46:54,900
I found the parents.

818
01:47:13,950 --> 01:47:15,300
Station there.

819
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:21,050
So you've decided plimbaþi all day?

820
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:23,450
George wanted to see the leaves on the trees.

821
01:47:38,550 --> 01:47:41,550
N-you have no idea
where they went, you?

822
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:44,600
Thi-I said,
I never talked about it.

823
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:11,500
Hey!

824
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:14,850
I'll handle this.

825
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:26,150
Come on, Luke.

826
01:48:29,950 --> 01:48:31,350
Hello!

827
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:45,050
I think you can use a vacation.

828
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:57,200
Thank you.

829
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:31,700
Too bad you did not find him any more.

830
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:35,550
Yes. I would love to
to know what it is.

831
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:39,350
I searched all the sights,
but I found nothing.

832
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:43,150
- It's the presidential palace.
- What?

833
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:45,800
They aired on CNN and when it was the collapse
the earthquake.

834
01:49:49,550 --> 01:49:52,300
- I know where they went.
- Me and my show.

835
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:01,700
Open the door!

836
01:50:01,850 --> 01:50:03,250
And I'll take a look!

837
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,300
Let's go!

838
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:27,800
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
Yet nobody gets up on the plan.

839
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:29,850
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
Sorry!

840
01:50:30,150 --> 01:50:31,650
Excuse me, please!

841
01:50:49,350 --> 01:50:52,150
Sorry, nobody on the flight
who fit this description.

842
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:54,850
Not at all. I'm here.
You have pictures?

843
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:58,800
We have their pictures
but not in this plan.

844
01:50:59,550 --> 01:51:01,850
There are flights to Haiti and other
tonight?

845
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:03,800
There are no other flights, sir.

846
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,500
There are no other flights.
May want something?

847
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:15,100
No.

848
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:17,300
No, thank you.

849
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:22,000
It started to rain.

850
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:27,800
I'll tell the FBI.

851
01:51:33,950 --> 01:51:37,650
Have you wondered why I find
this bag and others not?

852
01:51:47,150 --> 01:51:49,360
Captain of the lights
seatbelts.

853
01:51:49,370 --> 01:51:53,870
Flight to Caracas, Venezuela, in the evening
it takes 5 hours and 15 minutes.

854
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:58,480
If you're sitting on a chair, Captain
asks you to put seat belts.

855
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:08,500
- This guy is a teacher.
- In a college.

856
01:55:44,350 --> 01:55:47,350
- It heard how he jumped on a button.
- Huh?

857
01:55:52,750 --> 01:55:55,000
It heard how he jumped on a button.

858
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:07,400
- It was raining when we investigated the crime scene?
- Three years ago? Why are you here?

859
01:56:32,850 --> 01:56:35,750
Behave like a real cop.
Take the other side.

860
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:37,300
You're crazy.

861
01:56:39,100 --> 01:56:41,300
- Ready?
- Yes.

862
01:56:44,250 --> 01:56:46,200
- You can call?
- Yes.

863
01:57:00,250 --> 01:57:02,450
You really believed that we find it for you?
