1
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,590
I can't believe that I
didn't get a pedicure for this.

2
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,270
How embarrassing.

3
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,190
Look at that.

4
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,110
If I were with a real guy doing this
I would have gotten a pedicure,

5
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,230
and a wax.

6
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,830
Oh shit, that one’s worse!

7
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,870
- Sorry I didn't get a pedicure.
- What?

8
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,630
Uh, my toes.

9
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,550
I am Sorry.

10
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,550
I'm not looking at your toes,

11
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,510
- I'm looking at your cervix.
- Right.

12
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,230
Now I kind of wish you were
looking at my toes.

13
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,390
- All done.
- That's it?

14
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,070
We'll, uh, elevate your legs for 10 minutes
and you'll be good to go.

15
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,910
This is the first I hear the ticking
clock sound and I'm not freaking out.

16
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,950
Good. Just relax.

17
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,910
I can't, I'm totally freaking out!

18
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,510
Oh, come on, everything is going to be great.

19
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,470
I have a feeling that you
and, um, CRM-1014

20
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,430
are going to make beautiful babies together.

21
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,190
Thank you.

22
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,630
Oh God, I hope this works.

23
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,510
I wanted this for so long.

24
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,510
Maybe this isn't how I pictured it...
exactly,

25
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,550
thought I would have a little
more support.

26
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,270
No, you don't want kids!
Trust me.

27
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,230
Well that’s easy for you to say,
you have four.

28
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,110
And it's awful.

29
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,150
They've ruined my life!

30
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,830
What?!
No, go away!

31
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,630
Have you seen my vagina?
I mean have you?

32
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,670
But I wouldn't show it to you,
I will show it to you

33
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,510
just to prove you do not want to have kids.

34
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,590
I will show you, my vagina!

35
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,430
I don't want to see that,
I want to have a baby.

36
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,230
I just think you're tired
of being alone,

37
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,390
you haven't met the right guy ...

38
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,110
It's not about a guy,
this isn't about a guy

39
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,110
I've dated hundreds of guys
over the past five years

40
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,950
not one of them is close
to being the one.

41
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,830
It's just not happening for me.

42
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,830
Yeah, but that does not mean
that it won't.

43
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,870
- Doesn't mean that it will.
- Is that my chicken?!

44
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,710
What are you doing?!

45
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,510
That is your dinner, not a toy!

46
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,430
I hate them.

47
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,230
Do you smell pee?

48
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,110
So I had to figure it out on my own.

49
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,950
I examined every possibility

50
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,990
and arrived at the most logical conclusion.

51
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,910
Would you be my baby daddy?

52
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,870
What?!

53
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,750
No, I can't be the father,
Are you out of your mind?!

54
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,550
What are you talking...
No, no!

55
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,670
I'm in my sexual prime, alright!

56
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,550
I have countless more women to bed before
I do something idiotic as having a baby.

57
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,310
Clyde, you're my friend.

58
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,350
Don't you want to help me?

59
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,230
I mean, we don't have to have sex.

60
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,070
You don't have to be involved at all.

61
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,150
Alright? Just... give me your sperm.

62
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,030
Oh, oh. Ok. Ok.

63
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,750
You're... you're feeling lonely, alright? Maybe a little...
a little dead down there. I get it, I get it.

64
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,510
Long time since you had uh... you know...

65
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,350
- J..Just shut up! Ok! Just forget it! Forget the whole thing.
- What?

66
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,310
Well that was a bust.

67
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,990
So I took life by the, uh... horns?

68
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,830
and I... I did what I had to do.

69
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:44,990
Yeah.

70
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,670
It's going to be ok.

71
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,470
I have a plan.

72
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,190
- Whoa, You don't have to walk like that!
- Well, oh... ok.

73
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,190
Uh, by the way, I know a
excellent support group

74
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,990
for single moms,
if you're interested.

75
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,030
Great! Great.

76
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,670
Maybe we should hug? We might have
just made a baby together.

77
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,670
- Good luck.
- Okay. Alright.

78
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,190
- Hi.
- Hi.

79
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,710
- Hi!
- Get away from me!

80
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,430
Taxi!

81
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,910
Excuse me,

82
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,750
this is my cab.

83
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,630
- What, you own it?
- No, but I'm about to rent it.

84
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,350
If you see someone hail a cab
and a cab pulls up

85
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,630
you can't just jump in the cab
and say it yours?

86
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,310
- I didn't see you.
- I saw you see me.

87
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,230
Sir? sir... excuse me

88
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,390
Who saw you first?

89
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,870
Look, maybe you're not from around here
but there is a code, you know

90
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,830
there are certain rules we try to follow ...

91
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,750
Fine!
Forget it, I get out!

92
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,870
But not because your right

93
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,750
but because I am in a terrific mood
and you're ruining it.

94
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,750
No, I'll get out.

95
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,510
- Now what?
- I don't know, you tell me?

96
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,390
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Where's it going?

97
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,510
Come back!

98
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,270
Well, that was stupid!

99
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,030
Why did you get out?!

100
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,790
You stupid head!

101
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,030
You said you were in a good
mood and I was ruining it.

102
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,830
I felt bad.

103
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,830
I'm sorry, did you tell me a
stupid head?

104
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,190
How is your great mood now?

105
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,990
Please stop talking to me.

106
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,670
So why you such a good
mood anyways?

107
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,670
Not that it’s your business but
good things are happening to me.

108
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,590
That's great,
I hope it continues.

109
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,430
Thanks

110
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,150
Well, have a nice life

111
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,110
and try not to steal any more cabs.

112
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,230
Yeah, you do the same.

113
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,750
Hey, there's a penny right there.
Why don't you pick it up, its good luck.

114
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,870
Only if it's heads.

115
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,270
Now somebody else can have good luck.

116
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,310
- Bye.
- Bye.

117
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,070
Thank you for coming to Hudson Mutts.

118
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,030
- Hi Nutzy
- Oh my God.

119
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,950
You're glowing.

120
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,670
- Oh my God, she's glowing, right?
- Uh, huh.

121
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,510
- Tell us everything.
- There's not much to tell.

122
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,470
No, no, no... you just got shot up with a wad of
red headed, freckle sperm. There's something to tell.

123
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,510
Wait, he had red hair and freckles,
why'd you do that?

124
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,310
- I tried to talk her out of it.
- Red pubes... ew!

125
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,150
I never saw his pubes, it was a vial of semen.

126
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,190
So come on, what happened?

127
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,990
I laid down, put my feet up over my head

128
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,030
and five minutes later
it was over.

129
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,750
I barely felt a thing.

130
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,710
Basically it was like having
sex with Clyde.

131
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,630
You wish.

132
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,590
If you need me I'll be back
with legs over my head.

133
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,590
- Red hair and freckles!
- You had your chance!

134
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,310
What?

135
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,470
I do not know, it’s just weird, you know

136
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,390
who was this guys she was with anyways?

137
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,030
- She wasn't actually with him.
- Yeah, but I still want to kick his ass.

138
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,030
- Is that wrong?
- You're stupid.

139
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,030
Ok, alright.

140
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,670
Welcome to Single Mothers
and Proud.

141
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,550
As the name suggests
we are all single... mothers

142
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,590
and, uh, proud.

143
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,470
Some of us have adopted

144
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,190
some of us have conceived
with a donor,

145
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,150
every stories is different,
but with the same common denominator

146
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,030
wanted a child

147
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,030
and we made it happen on our own.

148
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,630
We sure did, we sure did.

149
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,470
Are you already a single mother
or you trying to become one?

150
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,350
I was just inseminated a few days ago.

151
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,310
Inseminated,

152
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,270
makes me feel like
a cow or something.

153
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,150
Well, we do what we have to do

154
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,150
when we don't have a penis partner.

155
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,070
So, let’s hear about you.

156
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,910
Oh, ok. Let's see ...

157
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,710
I own a pet store.

158
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,510
Yeah, I use to work in the corporate world.

159
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,390
Which was great for a while

160
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,390
but just didn't feel like the life
I wanted to live.

161
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,110
So, now I am happy on the work front

162
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,190
but, you know, I don't know

163
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,910
even though I have more balance,

164
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,750
personal... I still haven't found the one.

165
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,630
Well, the elusive one.
Good luck.

166
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,350
If I had a dollar for every
time I hear that.

167
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,550
I thought I'd be married
with kids by now

168
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,230
but that’s just not happening

169
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,270
so, I guess it’s time for my
backup plan.

170
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,950
Well, Zoe listen,
if you really want a baby

171
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,870
we here at Single Mothers
and Proud... ah ha...

172
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,590
We can be your partners.

173
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,510
From inception to graduation,
everything in between

174
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,470
We can be here for you.

175
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,350
Great.

176
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,990
Dakota was born here,
in this very room.

177
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,910
Right where you are sitting actually.

178
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,910
Really?

179
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,790
Right here?
Imagine that.

180
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,510
So how old is your baby, now?

181
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,470
I'm three.

182
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,150
So cute.

183
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,190
Why do you need a support group?

184
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,910
- You're not very supportive.
- What?

185
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:47,790
You just told me that if I breast feed, my girls
are going to end up looking like empty tube socks.

186
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,830
Hey, I'm just being honest.

187
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,470
Don't even get me started on what
child birth does to your bladder.

188
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,470
What does it do to your bladder?

189
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,230
Oh, I just peed a little bit.

190
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,270
I don't think I'm pregnant anyways.

191
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,030
The doctor said it would take a few tries.
Something about frozen sperm being lazy.

192
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,950
Oh, come with me for a minute

193
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,750
I have to make some muffins for some
bullshit teacher's appreciation day.

194
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,550
You're going to make muffins?

195
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,430
Oh hell no.

196
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,390
There is a place here that sells them,

197
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,230
I pick out the worse ones
and I pretend that I made them.

198
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,390
Come on.

199
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,030
Okay. Which is the ugliest?

200
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,150
It seems too much trouble
over something so trivial.

201
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,910
Welcome to motherhood.

202
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,070
There's that guy?

203
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,230
What guy?

204
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,870
The one selling cheese
I know him.

205
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,830
He's hot.

206
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,630
He sells cheese?

207
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,670
You sell hamsters.

208
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,710
Can I help you ladies?

209
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,510
No, we're good, thank you.

210
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,350
Like what you see?

211
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,310
What?

212
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,150
Just talking about the muffins.

213
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,070
- Hey you.
- Hey.

214
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,070
Hi
What.. what a nice surprise!

215
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,790
How did you know I worked here?

216
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,910
I didn't.

217
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,710
Oh, ok.

218
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,830
Did you follow me here?

219
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,630
Follow you?

220
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,350
To the farmers market, are you kidding me?

221
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,430
We... we came to buy muffins.

222
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,150
You where here, tell him.

223
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,070
Well, you better buy something,
because you ate all my samples.

224
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,190
It's really nice to see you,
I never got your name.

225
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,990
- I'm Stan.
- Oh, Zoe.

226
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,670
I'm Mona. So how do you
two not know each other?

227
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,590
- He stole my cab.
- She stole my cab.

228
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,390
Oh, ok.

229
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,430
We should go.

230
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,230
We should?

231
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,350
Yeah, we have that important thing.

232
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,310
Well, can your important thing
wait for a few minutes?

233
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,190
I'll give you a taste of my cheese.

234
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,870
I can rephrase that.

235
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,790
Ok, this is our basic chevre.

236
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,830
Probably our best seller,

237
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,590
or the cheese that started it all
as they say.

238
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,350
These are our surface ripen
cheeses, these are fantastic.

239
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,390
And these are the aged
raw milk cheeses.  Now...

240
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,150
This is really boring, isn't it?

241
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,070
- Uh, Yes.
- Um, No.

242
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,910
This is Louie,
he works for me.

243
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,950
- Hi
- Hi, Zoe

244
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,630
Can I get you a sample box?

245
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,750
Um, I'm ok.

246
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,550
You're not lactose intolerant
are you? I hate that.

247
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,310
Hey, you're still coming over
tonight right?

248
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,350
I... um, yeah, yeah.

249
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,070
We should go.

250
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,990
- Ready?
- I want a sample box.

251
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,950
Ok, well I got to go.
Bye.

252
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,870
Uh, bye.

253
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,750
Bye.

254
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,590
- You said free sample box, right?
- Yes.

255
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,070
Ok, spill it.

256
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,910
Who is he , what does he do,
how do we know him?

257
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,670
Who?

258
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,830
Stan, from the farmers market.

259
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,670
He's called twice already.

260
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,630
I'm going to kill Mona.

261
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,470
Is he a farmer?

262
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,270
He makes cheese.

263
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,390
He's a pilgrim?

264
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,070
Oh, Mona called too, she says his feta was
incredible. That makes so much more sense now.

265
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,190
Who is this guy?

266
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,910
He's nobody,

267
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,070
he's just some guy.

268
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,950
Are you blushing?
She's blushing right?

269
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,950
- You're totally blushing.
- She's blushing.

270
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,710
Can we just calm down and get
ready for the book signing?

271
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,630
No, this is exciting. I'm
not calming down.

272
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,630
Look, he's nobody,

273
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,390
and even if he was somebody,
it doesn't matter

274
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,470
cut, I don't want to be with anybody.

275
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:54,230
Okay?
So let’s just get back to work.

276
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,230
- Finding a relationship is work...
- I do not want a relationship.

277
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,910
Well, it is.

278
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,950
So dogs have a ingrain pack mentality.

279
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,590
If we don't assert leadership
over our dogs

280
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,470
our dogs are going to show unstable
behaviour or dominate behaviour.

281
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,590
In other words,

282
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,190
in the dog world, who you are
is stable or unstable energy.

283
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,350
A leader or a follower.

284
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,030
So, when a dog introduces
himself to another dog,

285
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,030
What do they do?

286
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,030
Exactly.

287
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,910
When a human wants
meet a dog ...

288
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,910
Oh my God! He's so ...

289
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,710
So, I mean, it’s like poor dog ..

290
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:37,470
And so they're interacting based on
energy and also the nose ...

291
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,390
Ok, now this is getting weird.

292
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,390
I know we keep running into
each other, it's crazy.

293
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,230
Oh, so your being here,
is just another coincidence?

294
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,950
Oh no, I love this guy.

295
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,110
- Don't you have some place to be tonight?
- Not 'til later.

296
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,030
- Do you even have a dog?
- No.

297
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,750
But I might get one now that
I can be the pack leader.

298
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,590
I'm really busy here.

299
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,350
Ok so, you have a boyfriend or something.
Just tell me, I can take it.

300
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,390
Or you're just no, you're
not interested in me?

301
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,070
You're making a big mistake,
I am very interesting.

302
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,190
I'm just not interested
in men right now.

303
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,870
Oh, you... you're gay?

304
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,070
I'm not gay!

305
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,590
Hey you two, would you please
take it outside?

306
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,790
- Sorry.
- Ok, sorry, sorry about that.

307
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,470
This is not a good
time for me, ok.

308
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,430
I'm going through some changes.

309
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,350
Menopause?

310
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,150
Menopause?

311
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,230
Seriously?

312
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,230
How old do think I am?

313
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,110
Ok, you know, let’s start over,
because the more I think about it,

314
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,950
we'd never make it as a
couple anyway.

315
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,830
You're way too sceptical,
We should be friends.

316
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,870
I have enough friends.

317
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,910
You can never have
too many friends.

318
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,630
What are you doing tonight?

319
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,790
Getting take out and
going home to bed.

320
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,630
Clearly you don't have
that many friends.

321
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,350
Ok, here's my proposition

322
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,350
and don't freak out because
it require very little commitment.

323
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,270
I'm getting take out too,

324
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,110
let's walk together towards
the same place,

325
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,070
order and pay for our
own respective meals

326
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,150
and we'll say goodbye.

327
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,110
Where do you want to go?

328
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,510
Thank you.

329
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,270
No fair, you chose this place
because it takes two seconds.

330
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,270
No, I chose it because it's the best.

331
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,230
Alright, well I want to see you take a
bite of that. I don't believe you'll eat it.

332
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,990
Fine.

333
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,870
There, happy now?

334
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,630
You have no idea how good this is.

335
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,750
I cannot believe you lived
New York your whole life

336
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,550
and you've never gone
to Gray's Papaya.

337
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,590
What's wrong with you?

338
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,430
Actually I haven't lived
here all my life.

339
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,390
We moved out of the city when
my parents bought the farm.

340
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,030
No, not die, they actually...

341
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,030
they bought a farm
and we moved upstate.

342
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,830
They retired to Phoenix
five years ago,

343
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,910
and I run the place now.

344
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,750
What about your family?

345
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,670
Actually my parents died
when I was young.

346
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,670
It's just me and my
grandmother now.

347
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,550
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

348
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,510
It's ok, it was long time ago.

349
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,270
I really have to go.

350
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,230
Alright, but I cannot let
you walk home alone because...

351
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:07,030
this is very dangerous neighbourhood.

352
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,630
What school did you go to?

353
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:21,390
Well, I kind of dropped out. I met this
Swedish girl during my semester abroad...

354
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,510
Let me guess,

355
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,310
you fell in love and got married.

356
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,110
- And started an inn in Vermont.
- Of course.

357
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,110
It lasted like three seconds,

358
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,910
I didn't know how to run an inn

359
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,830
and she didn't know how not to sleep
the everyone that worked there, so...

360
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,670
- Ouch
- we got divorced, yeah...

361
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,670
She took everything.

362
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,590
I had to move back
in with my parents.

363
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,430
Work myself out of debt,

364
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,350
and tried to figure out how not to blame every
women on the planet for honest Harish ways.

365
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,430
How's that going?

366
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,390
Not so good.

367
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,910
Ok, I want to know everything.

368
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,750
First kiss?

369
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,830
Some jerk with a dirt
bike and chapped lips.

370
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,670
You?

371
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,710
7th grade, she wore braces
and head gear

372
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,390
- It was terrifying.
- Ouch

373
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,190
Hey, look.

374
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,030
- Here's one for you.
- That's weird.

375
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,830
Ok, best kiss?

376
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,790
Um, that's a tough one.

377
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,590
Because, if we weren't just friends.

378
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,510
I'd kiss you right now,

379
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,550
and I'd be your best kiss.

380
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,390
How do you know?

381
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,310
I know.

382
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,510
Someone looking for you?

383
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,470
Yeah, I have to go.

384
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,150
- Okay.
- Okay.

385
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,110
- Bye.
- Bye.

386
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,110
I'll call you.

387
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,910
You think it was
the muffin girl?

388
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,630
I guess... I don't know.

389
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,590
Why do I even care?

390
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,590
You like him! Ow!

391
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,470
What if I'm pregnant?

392
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,350
Then it'll work out perfectly.

393
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,150
- What do you mean?
- Because,

394
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,190
if you really like him, as soon as
that happens you'll break up with him

395
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,070
because you're pregnant

396
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,870
and you wouldn't have to put yourself
out there, possibly get hurt.

397
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:32,990
Hey, that's your dream.

398
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,790
Ah, besides ...

399
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,430
I'm not pregnant.

400
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,350
And I'm ok on my own.

401
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,350
You're going to see him again?

402
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,190
Yeah, I think so.

403
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,590
It's not going to happen Nutzy.

404
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,230
Hello.

405
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,950
Oh, Stan.

406
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,070
Go away.

407
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,070
Stop it.

408
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,910
You're making me nervous.

409
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,030
You're early.

410
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,830
I'll be a minute, okay?

411
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,790
Uh, 3 to 5 minutes actually.

412
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,710
You want a beer?

413
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,710
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.
You want one?

414
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,510
- I'll let you know.
- Okay.

415
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,150
Oh my God. Is he ok?

416
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,990
He's fine. Happens all the time.

417
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:29,830
I'm sorry.

418
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,870
Can you give me a minute?

419
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,550
- Yeah, yeah.
- Ok, good.

420
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,550
Damn it Nuts.

421
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,390
Give me that.

422
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,270
Give it to me.

423
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,990
Let go. Now!

424
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,870
Zoe, everything okay?

425
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:53,830
Yeah!

426
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,590
You know, just showing
him who's the pack leader.

427
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,550
You idiot!

428
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,310
You better not swallow that thing.
Give it to me.

429
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,270
Nutzy, open.
Open.

430
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,910
- You look really pretty tonight.
- Thank you.

431
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,790
You always look really pretty

432
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,830
but tonight you look, uh,
especially pretty.

433
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,510
And that dress is, uh, ...

434
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,550
is really something.

435
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,470
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

436
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,190
Did you buy a new dress
for our date tonight?

437
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,270
- Don't flatter yourself.
- I'll take that as a yes.

438
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,950
I guess you'll never know.

439
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,870
I guess not.

440
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,590
- Except you left the price tag on.
- What?

441
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,550
Allow me.

442
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,590
I got it.

443
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,750
You know, I had this dress
for a long time,

444
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,670
it's just I haven't worn it yet.

445
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,590
It's why the tag still on.

446
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,590
You're not that special.

447
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,550
Really?

448
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,230
Look at this place.

449
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,230
I don't know what to say.

450
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,990
Finally.

451
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,030
What's that suppose to mean?!

452
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,910
It just means good.
Don't say anything.

453
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,030
You don't have to say anything.

454
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,710
You know, just come
over here, sit down.

455
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,790
You think I talk too much?

456
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,590
- I did not say that.
- So what'd you say?

457
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:57,390
It's just you're very quick, you always
have an response for things. Which I like,

458
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,550
but tonight, just you know,
just be surprised.

459
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:11,990
Surprise.

460
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,670
You're good.

461
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,750
- So you work for an internet company?
- Uh huh.

462
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,390
- I don't see that at all.
- Oh, I was a very important person. You
would have been very impressed.

463
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,430
- Really?
- Uh huh.

464
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,190
How did you get the pet store?

465
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,110
Actually it was due to my dog, Nuts. I bought
him at this fancy dog store near my house.

466
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,150
Cutest puppy you've ever seen.

467
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,070
6 months later he almost dies.

468
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,910
Turns out he was from one of those puppy mills,
where the dogs are so in bred, he was falling apart.

469
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,630
What did you do?
Did you sue them?

470
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,390
I thought about it, but then
I thought what good would that do,

471
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,390
they'll still sell in bred dogs,

472
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,190
So I quit my job,
and I took the

473
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,190
stock option money
over to the pet store,

474
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,230
and I bought it.

475
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,990
I know how to milk a goat
Does that do anything for you?

476
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,790
No, not really.

477
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,670
Can I ask you a serious question Zoe?

478
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,430
What?

479
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:15,070
Did you buy that dress
to wear for me tonight?

480
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,630
I will never tell.

481
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,350
Really?
Because, uh ...

482
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,230
I have ways of
making you talk.

483
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,630
Let me get that, let me get that.
Oh!

484
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,510
Hose... hose over there
behind the fence.

485
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:02,230
You see it?
Got the hose?

486
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,510
Ok, this is war.

487
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:34,750
You weren't even pointing at the fire,
you were pointing at my face.

488
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,830
I wasn't even trying to soak you,
I swear.

489
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,470
Whatever, I looked into your eyes and saw
you had this crazy look, like a crazy person

490
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,350
Not true.

491
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,470
It is true and... you know what else,
I think I owe you another dress.

492
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:49,070
And I definitely own you another date.

493
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,190
Well, I'd like that.

494
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,950
Why don't you come to the farm
with me next weekend?

495
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:59,910
I'll call you.

496
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,590
I'll wait by the phone.

497
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,030
What?

498
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,310
Holly shit!

499
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,110
I know.

500
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,190
Are you sure?

501
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,030
If I'm not then my dog is.

502
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,790
You're not making any sense.

503
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,870
So you're definitely pregnant?

504
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,910
Congratulations
How we feeling?

505
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,590
- We're freaking out!
- What she said.

506
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,470
Why? We preformed an
intrauterine insemination

507
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,350
using sperm that you purchased.

508
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,390
This isn't exactly what
we call an accident.

509
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,110
It's just happening so fast.

510
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,230
Keep breathing.

511
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,870
Pump those arms.
What did you all eat last night?

512
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,710
- Hey Arthur.
- Well, hello my dear.

513
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,750
Oh no, no, don't get up. It's ok.

514
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,630
I can't get up.

515
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,550
- Came to see my lovely fiancée?
- Yes.

516
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:42,350
Oh, she's looking fine today,
let me tell you, just fine.

517
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,310
- Hi sweetheart.
- Hey.

518
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,150
- I need to talk to you.
- Sure.

519
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,270
Alone.

520
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:51,150
Surely! Don't worry about them,
they can't hear anything anyways.

521
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,870
I am pregnant.

522
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,790
- What?
- I'm pregnant.

523
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,630
- How what?
- I'm pregnant.

524
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,470
I cannot hear you darling.

525
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,510
Oh Jesus, Judy, she's pregnant!
Turn up your hearing aid.

526
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,150
I'm confused...

527
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,030
you said that this was what you wanted.

528
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,710
But this guy, he's special.

529
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,870
Now the whole thing is going to fall apart.

530
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,790
What makes him so special?

531
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:24,550
I do not know, he's very... real,

532
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,350
and funny.

533
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,350
And different.

534
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,230
I like him Nana.

535
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,230
What should I do?

536
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,950
Zoe, you always get ahead of yourself.
You barely know him.

537
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,790
Spend some time with him,

538
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,670
see what he's really like.

539
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,630
He could be a total douche bag

540
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,470
and then the whole thing is moot.

541
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,070
- Maybe he is a douche bag.
- Oh come on.

542
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,870
You really think he would ask you away
for the weekend if he had a girlfriend?

543
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,830
There's no way he's dating
that muffin bitch, Zoe.

544
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:06,830
Trust me.

545
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,790
Who can say?

546
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,470
Maybe he's looking to get laid?

547
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,390
Well, don't have sex
with him, ok? You can't

548
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:15,230
- because that would really complicate things.
- I know.

549
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,310
Oh, it’s going to be hard though

550
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,270
with three times the blood
coursing through your body.

551
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,310
Excuse me?

552
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,070
Oh, yeah.

553
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,150
That's why pregnant women
are so Horney all the time.

554
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,070
Is that what it is?

555
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:27,870
I thought it was me.

556
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,790
No, when I was pregnant

557
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,710
my body was so sensitive

558
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,670
I could have an orgasm
sitting on a bus.

559
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,550
I think I'm going to get sick.

560
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,430
- Me too.
- What?

561
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,270
It's a happy story.

562
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,390
Alright, I'm just
going to go up there

563
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,070
and tell him that I'm pregnant

564
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,030
- just lower my cards on the table.
- Ok, good.

565
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,110
Just don't lay on the table.

566
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,070
Ok, because you cannot have sex.

567
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,910
Don't look at me like that.

568
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,950
I know, this is a big mess we're in.

569
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,670
I'm going to fix it.

570
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,510
Shit, here it is.

571
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,510
Watch out for that tree.

572
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,270
Yeah, thanks.

573
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,950
- Hi.
- Hi.

574
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,910
The tree should not have been there,
that's all I'm going to say.

575
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,630
Whatever Mrs. Magoo.

576
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,470
- Oh, ok.
- Come on now, I am glad you're here.

577
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,270
Me too.

578
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:40,350
Stan, there's something
I need to tell you.

579
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,950
I am pregnant.

580
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,710
Yes, pregnant.

581
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,070
I'm going to have a baby.

582
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,070
I'm with child.

583
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,710
Shit.

584
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:19,470
Stan... Stan... Stan...
I've been inseminated.

585
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,230
Yes, inseminated.

586
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,070
I'm going to have a baby!

587
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,470
Uh, would you like a plate?

588
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,350
Um, a napkin? trough?

589
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,030
These are for you.

590
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,030
- That's sweet, thank you.
- You're welcome. You're good.

591
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,630
It's just that stew is so delicious.

592
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,630
I knew you liked it.

593
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,710
So, what's the next step
for a cheese farmer?

594
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,590
Very funny.

595
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:58,190
I want to start a sustainable
Gourmet Shop, okay.

596
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,190
Cheese, wine, bread,

597
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,270
prepared foods.

598
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,030
But everything local,

599
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,190
nothing from farther than 30 miles.

600
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,110
All based on the farmers markets.

601
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,950
- That's a good idea.
- Thank you very much.

602
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,710
I'm good at ideas, I'm just
not good with follow through.

603
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,590
I wasn't good at marriage,

604
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,350
I wasn't good at running
a bed and breakfast,

605
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,430
thank God we didn't have kids.

606
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,230
You don't want kids?

607
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,350
I don't think so.

608
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,190
Well, I don't know.

609
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,950
For years I've never thought about the future,

610
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,150
just kind of lived in the moment.

611
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,030
But maybe I'm different now.

612
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:32,870
I really want to take the next step,

613
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,750
I want to move on with my life.

614
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,430
- About the future ...
- Uh huh.

615
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,550
- Let's talk about that.
- Ok.

616
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:43,510
Because the future is now.

617
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,150
- Right?
- Right.

618
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,910
There's something
I need to tell you.

619
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:53,910
Hold that thought.

620
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,830
Come here.

621
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,230
- I want to show you something.
- What is it?

622
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,030
- It's cheese.
- I can see that.

623
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,990
No, no, no, it's new.

624
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:20,670
I had this idea to use these two
different types of goat's milk

625
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,630
to come up with something
really unique.

626
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:27,630
It's sweet and sassy
and complex.

627
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,510
I was inspired.

628
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,150
So what are you saying?
I'm your cheese muse?

629
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,110
Yeah.

630
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,590
You're kind of hard
to read right now.

631
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:57,150
Well, I really want to kiss you,

632
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:01,990
but it smells like
cheese in here.

633
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,390
We have to ...

634
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,390
take it slow, Okay?

635
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,230
- We can't have sex.
- Fine.

636
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:30,910
Ok... Ok... Ok... Ok...

637
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:51,990
Did you just ...

638
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,310
Holly shit!

639
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,190
Is my nose bleeding?
You punched me.

640
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,070
- Sorry.
- It's ok.

641
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:13,910
It was amazing.

642
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,790
It was like over the top amazing.
What was that, like a 3 or 4 for you?

643
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:25,590
Stan... Stan...
There's something I have to tell you.

644
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:30,350
Ok, what is it?

645
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,510
Why are you crying?

646
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,470
I'm pregnant.

647
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:55,070
I'm pretty sure it doesn't
happen that fast.

648
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,990
I know it... it's hard to explain.

649
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,030
What are you talking about?

650
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,630
I'm pregnant.

651
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,230
Who's the father?

652
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,030
I don't know

653
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,150
I mean, I know who it is,
I just don't know his name exactly.

654
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,830
It's a donor of a
sperm bank.

655
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,670
Seriously, what the hell
are you talking about?

656
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,750
When did all this happened?

657
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,710
Actually, it was the day we met.

658
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,430
Yeah, I didn't think to
tell you because

659
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:37,390
I didn't think there was any way

660
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,350
that I could be
pregnant so fast.

661
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,150
But why?

662
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,190
Because I wanted a baby.

663
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,190
And I never met the right guy

664
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,030
and I thought that if I waited any
longer, I might miss my chance.

665
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,750
Alright, we just make love

666
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:52,790
and you're telling me that your
pregnant with some stranger's child.

667
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,550
Don't say it like that.

668
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,510
You make it sound dirty.

669
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,550
I wanted a baby

670
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,310
and I thought I had
to do it alone.

671
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,470
It was before I met you.

672
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:02,350
I don't know what to say.

673
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,350
What am I supposed to say?
Congratulations,

674
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,270
this is terrific news?

675
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,990
I made this big decision,
this... this thing

676
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,950
and then I met you.

677
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:15,710
I'm sorry.

678
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:18,590
About what? Getting pregnant
or lying to me about it?

679
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,630
- I didn't lie.
- You didn't tell the truth.

680
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:24,790
Where are you going?

681
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,590
I thought this would be easier.

682
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:29,470
To just disappear at the crack of dawn?
Don't I get a say?

683
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:32,350
You said everything there
was to say last night.

684
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,430
No, I didn't.

685
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:36,350
Oh, you left out the part that you had
a girlfriend, that was pretty convenient.

686
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:38,350
I don't have a girlfriend.

687
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:41,190
That girl from the farmers market?

688
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:43,990
She's not my girlfriend.

689
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:46,750
She was, but was a few years ago.

690
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:54,670
Olivia is in my class,
we study together.

691
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,510
Study what?

692
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:00,350
I'm a student. I'm still in school,
I go at night.

693
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:03,030
Why didn't you want to tell me?

694
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,950
Because it's embarrassing.

695
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,990
You're this incredibly accomplished person,

696
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,870
and I didn't even finish college?

697
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:10,950
I mean, I have this great life but...

698
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,510
barely passing economics, you know.

699
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:27,030
Where are you going?

700
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:28,950
Look, let’s not drag this out, ok?

701
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,910
I lied to you,
you lied to me.

702
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,070
We both have other plans,

703
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,710
and being together is just
messing everything up.

704
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,630
We should just go
our separate ways.

705
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:39,630
Goodbye.

706
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,750
So how did you two meet?

707
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:34,710
- We can, uh, talk later in your office.
- Ok.

708
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:38,470
Well, everything seems
right on track.

709
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:40,510
A little blood, quite normal.

710
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:43,430
Stan, you have to stay here
if you don't want.

711
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:46,110
I'm fine, I'm good.

712
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:48,150
Now, I'm going to do an ultrasound.

713
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,870
This is how we view the future

714
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:55,870
Oh, I see, you rub it on her stomach. For a minute
I thought you're going to put that huge thing...

715
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,710
In her vagina?

716
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:00,630
It is too early to go
through the abdomen, you see.

717
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:04,310
We have to go through the vagina.

718
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:07,190
Vagina. Vagina. Vagina.
Vagina. Vagina.

719
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:10,270
Maybe if I say enough you'll
feel a little more comfortable.

720
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:12,190
- Vagina.
- It's not working.

721
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:16,070
Ok now Zoe,

722
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:19,870
with a little bit of luck,
we'll see a heartbeat.

723
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:24,430
That's it? That little thing?

724
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:26,390
Is everything okay?

725
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,510
Oh, everything is ...

726
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:35,110
- What, what?
- I see another heartbeat.

727
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:37,030
It has two hearts?

728
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,070
No, but you have two babies.

729
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:57,070
Are you going to leaving now?

730
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,950
Because this is more than
you bargained for.

731
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:01,950
It's more than I
bargained for.

732
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:05,910
But, just tell me, ok, so...
I can be prepared.

733
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,790
I just... need to sit here.
You know?

734
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:12,470
- Okay.
- Okay.

735
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:17,390
But then are you going to leave?

736
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:19,230
Ok, one kid is a lot,

737
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,270
two kids is a posse.

738
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:24,030
I'm just getting use
to us as a couple.

739
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:26,070
And now all of a sudden
you're having a posse?

740
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:28,670
Are you ready for a posse?

741
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:54,870
I don't even know if I like kids.

742
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,470
Hey! Beat it pal!

743
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:01,590
I don't want to cause a scene, but
get your hands out of your pockets

744
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:06,110
and get the hell out of here. No,
I'm talking to you

745
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:08,110
because you're the only pervert
with his hands in his pockets

746
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:09,990
at a playground.

747
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,870
- I'm not a pervert!
- Hey, if you don't have kids, get lost!

748
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:14,030
I have kids, Ok?

749
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:15,910
A week ago I didn't even
know she was pregnant

750
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:17,750
and now she's having twins!

751
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:19,590
I just saw the ultrasound.

752
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,550
The one that goes inside.

753
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:24,510
I know what you need.

754
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:28,310
How did this happen?

755
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,590
- Take that off
- This it?

756
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:42,750
- Yup
- Oh man, I'm dizzy.

757
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:44,590
I'm sweating and dizzy.

758
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:47,470
- That's normal, bro.
- Is it?

759
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:51,230
- Which one's yours?
- I've got three.

760
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:52,310
- Three?
- Yeah.

761
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,070
There is Charlie right there,
and that's Roxy.

762
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:57,870
You see the little fella over there? That's Matt

763
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:01,910
- He's eating sand
- Yeah

764
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:06,550
By the time you get to the third one,
you don't worry so much about that stuff.

765
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:09,630
What's it like, the whole kid thing?

766
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:12,430
It's great!

767
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:17,150
Except for the lack of sleep,

768
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:20,870
free time ... sex with my wife,

769
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:23,030
butt naked Friday's
in the family room ...

770
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:24,910
That's not the answer
I was looking for.

771
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,750
its fine.

772
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:30,550
The best way
I can describe it is ...

773
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:34,510
... It's awful, awful,
awful, awful

774
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,350
and then something incredible happens

775
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:44,950
And then awful, awful,
awful, awful, awful

776
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:48,830
And something incredible happens again

777
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:50,790
It's like this all day, every day

778
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:53,670
I feel like I'm drowning

779
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:56,430
like I'm gasping to
get my old life back

780
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:58,550
and then a small moment happens ...

781
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:03,110
... that’s so magical

782
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:06,910
So life affirming that it
makes it all worthwhile.

783
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:09,950
This will be best thing you ever do.

784
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:11,870
Dada.

785
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:15,710
Hey, son

786
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,470
I guess this would be that moment right?

787
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,470
Yup, this would be it.

788
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:24,190
- Hey, what do you have there, son?
- Poo poo

789
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:29,950
Well, almost.

790
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:33,790
- Son, is that cat shit?
- No

791
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:36,790
- That's your shit?
- No

792
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:40,750
This isn’t even his shit.

793
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:45,350
Charlie, Roxy, meet me at the bathroom!

794
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:48,190
What I tell you about playing
with other people shit?

795
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:51,030
So, why are you upset?

796
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:55,070
It's so lucky. To get pregnant on
the first try with frozen sperm

797
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:56,990
is rare but to get
pregnant with twins ...?

798
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:58,990
Come on, that's unheard of.

799
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,710
Ok, when you want to
speak you can.

800
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:06,510
Does anyone else have anything in
the mean time that they like to share?

801
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,550
- Tabitha?
- Yeah, I'm having a hard time

802
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:11,350
Luka keeps asking me why
his friends have two parents

803
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:14,310
and he only has one. I guess
I knew this would happen someday

804
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:17,190
- But I just wasn't prepared ...
- Ok, there's this guy, his name is Stan

805
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:20,070
- and he's fantastic
- Wasn't I just speaking?

806
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:22,710
You know, whenever you meet somebody,

807
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:24,750
the kind of guy who makes you
rethink everything like...

808
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:26,790
maybe I can be a stay
at home mom

809
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:29,550
Maybe I can. I love
being barefoot and pregnant

810
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:31,390
Maybe he can teach me how to make cheese

811
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,310
and we can live off the land

812
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:37,150
Zoe, this group is called
Single Mothers and Proud

813
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:40,070
I know. I know. I know

814
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:41,950
I'm sorry.

815
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:43,950
I wasn't planning to meet anybody.

816
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,950
It just... it just happened

817
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:48,670
And now I've thrown all
my plans out the window

818
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:51,710
and really... fallen for this guy.

819
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,430
I'm just afraid he might not stay.

820
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:00,350
What should I do?

821
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:05,990
I don't know

822
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:10,790
This is wildly outside my
field of expertise

823
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:13,590
Yeah, because we are a...

824
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:15,590
single mothers group.

825
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,510
So don't tend to give advice on
how to get your boyfriend to commit

826
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,390
Not usually.

827
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:22,390
Maybe you should join
a different group.

828
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:28,030
Ok, we are going to have to
take a vote on this Zoe, because ...

829
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:31,710
I think we all collectively
feel you are in a very

830
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:35,750
wildly different place
than where we are

831
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:38,550
- So we are going to take a vote.
- Ok

832
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,430
Hi

833
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,230
How did you find me?

834
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:09,150
I called the store. I said
it was an emergency

835
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:11,070
What is it?

836
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:16,950
You're crazy

837
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:21,830
- I don't expect you to stay
- I don't expect you to expect me to stay

838
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:25,470
What if I want to stay?

839
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:26,670
Well then I would be surprised

840
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:30,470
and happy.

841
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:34,270
- I can't promise anything.
- Neither can I.

842
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:39,950
Ok fine, give me the hot dog

843
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:51,430
Perry and Hudson. Feel
free to run every red light.

844
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:52,590
You got it.

845
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,350
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

846
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:05,750
This sucks! Nothing fits me!

847
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,710
Please let me wear sweats.

848
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:09,750
Honey, you can't wear sweats. This is important.

849
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:12,510
- I'll get that.
- Wait, let me suck it in.

850
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:17,470
Do you have a jacket or something?

851
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:27,990
- Gotcha, I gotcha. You alright?
- Yes.

852
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:33,790
I can't.

853
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:40,390
Watch it!

854
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:48,990
- I'm going to throw up.
- What?

855
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:54,790
Hey, how are you?

856
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:57,590
Stan, you are a prince. Thanks for coming.

857
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,510
Sea urchins?

858
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:13,950
- Hi
- Hi

859
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:22,550
I ripped my dress and I didn't
want to go... how about that?

860
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,630
- What is that thing?
- Oh, Mona gave it to me

861
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:49,550
It is supposed to help me sleep

862
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,950
- Hold on.
- Ok.

863
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:23,150
It has been two weeks now

864
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:25,950
and all she ever wants to do
is to sleep with that pillow

865
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,670
The pillow is a bitch. It's
totally replacing you, right?

866
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:30,550
Totally, completely. She
drags it everywhere

867
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:31,710
My wife, she drew eyes on hers.

868
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,390
So when I went to make a move
in the middle of the night

869
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,310
the pillow is staring at me

870
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:38,230
like... uh uh bro!
I don't think so.

871
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:40,350
We used to have sex all
time, every day!

872
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,230
Now I can't touch her.
I can pearly go near her.

873
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:44,110
Dude! she's pregnant. You can't win,

874
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:45,990
the one who wins is the pillow.

875
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:48,750
- Screw that pillow, man!
- You might have to.

876
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:50,750
I did once.

877
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:52,790
We're going to be fine.

878
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:56,590
We're going to get through this. Everything is going to be fine.

879
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:59,390
In a year’s time this is just
going to be a funny memory, right?

880
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:02,350
That’s right. Before you know it
the kids will be in school

881
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:05,350
and you long for the days when
a pillow was your biggest problem

882
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:09,910
It must be hard when they
first go off to school

883
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:11,830
Little school shoes, little backpacks

884
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:13,710
No, saying goodbye to the kid is easy

885
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,590
Saying goodbye to 20 grand,
now that's hard

886
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,710
What are you talking about?
20 grand? What's 20 grand?

887
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:21,550
And you will have twins.

888
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:27,190
Double whammy. That's a
whole lot of parmesan.

889
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:34,910
Oh my God!

890
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:37,910
Alright, this one says,
most natural nipple

891
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:40,670
That looks nothing
like my nipples, nana

892
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:42,750
This one says,
BPA free.

893
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:46,310
- What is BPA?
- Don't know

894
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:47,510
So how do you know you don't want it?

895
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:51,190
It's Biphenyl A and you don't want it.

896
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:54,230
If you're going to use a bottle, which we
do not advocate because the breast is best

897
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,950
- Better
- Use a glass bottle

898
00:59:57,830 --> 00:59:59,710
- How are you, honey?
- Good.

899
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,670
We miss you at the meetings

900
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:04,670
Yes

901
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:09,510
I never heard back after the vote
so I assumed that I was out

902
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:13,350
No, it was unanimous. Didn't
anyone called you? No?

903
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:22,070
This is my nana and this
is Arthur, her fiancé

904
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:23,790
- Hello
- Hello

905
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:24,870
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do?

906
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:26,590
So ... when are you get married?

907
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:28,550
She's kept me waiting for 22 years

908
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:30,470
so I'm not holding my breath

909
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:33,350
So, Zoe, can I put you
on the phone tree?

910
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:36,270
Kind of want the whole group
there when it happens.

911
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:41,230
- Thanks, that means a lot
- Ok, Well, happy shopping

912
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:44,830
and check out strollers on aisle
six because they're awesome.

913
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:46,870
- Do not you call her?
- I don't know

914
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:07,990
- Stan? Cookie!
- Zoe?

915
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:11,830
- What is that?
- It's a twin X deluxe

916
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:13,750
The Rolls-Royce of strollers

917
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:15,710
- Isn't it awesome?
- It's big.

918
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:17,550
It's supposed to fit through
most doorways

919
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:21,310
I don't think so. OK, let me help.
Turn it sideways...

920
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,230
Keep trying... there

921
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:26,110
Just hang on, It's got to
have a thing here

922
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,950
Hang on, hang on.

923
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:31,070
- Aw, Shit!
- Are you okay?

924
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:32,830
It bit me

925
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:36,870
What the hell is going on here?

926
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:39,590
You're suppose to get an outfit to bring
the babies home in from the hospital

927
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:41,510
Yeah, but how many babies
are you having?

928
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:43,310
Well, I just got two of everything

929
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:46,230
Look... baby village people

930
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:48,350
How much money did you spend today? Where
are we going to put all this shit anyway?

931
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:50,990
Do not worry it, everything will be ok

932
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:52,910
Yeah, I don't see how that’s possible.
You haven't even had the babies

933
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:54,150
and everything has changed

934
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:58,750
You know what? There's the door,
Stan. If you want to go, you can go

935
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:00,710
Stop! I hate it when you do that

936
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:07,470
I know, I'm sorry.

937
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:15,030
Let me see.

938
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:20,710
Sorry.

939
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:30,430
Have you gotten through page 279 yet?

940
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:35,350
No, I stopped reading when you tore
one of my pages and used it as a napkin

941
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:39,990
Well, it says here that
women in the third trimester

942
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:41,950
experience hormonal mood swings

943
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:44,950
and their partner just have to be
extra understanding about it

944
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,670
You coming on to me right
now? It's kind of hard to tell.

945
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:05,070
- What?
- You have chicken in your hair

946
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:07,710
- Just right there?
- I do?

947
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:09,630
Did I get it?

948
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:15,550
You know what, honey?

949
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:21,150
Just... I'm sorry, but not tonight, ok?

950
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:42,430
- Sorry
- It's okay

951
01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:14,030
Hey babe, you want some breakfast?

952
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:19,710
No, thank you. It's still night time

953
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:21,750
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

954
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:24,630
Do you know how much
preschool is? 20 grand.

955
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:26,430
For circle time.

956
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:30,190
What about college? Actually, I think
colleges run about 50 grand right now,

957
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:32,310
but that’s right now. So figure in
18 years it'll be doubled that at least

958
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:35,070
and... well we have twins
so double it  again.

959
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:37,910
So what's that? like 200 grand a year?

960
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:40,870
We haven't even bought books,
or clothes or shit you know?

961
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:43,790
Probably going to need
cars when they' re at school

962
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:46,670
You know I'm going to be a push over
and buying whatever they want

963
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:49,470
So what's that?
Half a million a year?

964
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:52,390
I don't have half a million a
year. I'm in night school

965
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:56,310
It's just something I was thinking
about. It's no big deal

966
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:03,030
Why don't you come back to bed, honey?

967
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:21,110
- Did I wake you up?
- No

968
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:31,870
We're going to be ok. I have money saved

969
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:36,630
It's not just about the money

970
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,430
You know, I'll figure out a
way to make enough money

971
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:43,150
What is it then?

972
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:48,910
It's just ... I need to know

973
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:53,710
Are you still in there?

974
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:01,550
I'm still here

975
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:10,350
Excuse me, can I... help you?

976
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:12,430
What do you think?

977
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:19,230
It's a bit overwhelming huh?

978
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:22,870
There're so many and are so... big

979
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:24,830
Well, they have to be
big. Two babies right?

980
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,790
Yeah, but... babies are small

981
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:33,390
These are for
giant mutant babies.

982
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:35,470
Well you should see some
of babies that come in here,

983
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:37,390
total fat asses.

984
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:42,270
By the way, my boyfriend
and I do customer work

985
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:46,910
We can solve this

986
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:32,950
- What are you doing?
- Nothing

987
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:35,830
- How was your exam?
- Shitty

988
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:37,830
Come on, come on,
what were you doing?

989
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:39,630
Nothing

990
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:43,510
I gained three more pounds this week

991
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:45,510
And I think it went all to my ass

992
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:48,270
You look great.
You always look great.

993
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:50,110
I missed you today.

994
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:52,990
I miss my old ass.

995
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:55,150
You know what’s weird?
I never knew your ass.

996
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:57,910
It was kind of like this ass
but way hotter.

997
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:10,510
Baby, this is my old ass.

998
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:16,030
What?

999
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:21,910
Why do you have a picture of your ass?

1000
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:23,750
My college boyfriend took it.

1001
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:27,550
I mean, so, in all fairness
it doesn't look exactly like that

1002
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:30,350
but it's pretty close,
it's held up

1003
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:32,430
Yeah, it's a nice ass.

1004
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:36,190
This is me in 7th grade

1005
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:40,950
This is me and nana at
my confirmation

1006
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:48,630
This is the last
picture I have of my mom

1007
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:52,430
I mean, she lived a few years
more after this but...

1008
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:56,230
We didn't take any pictures because
she didn't want us to remember her that way

1009
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:59,270
I was 8 years old when she died

1010
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:04,030
I can't imagine

1011
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:08,030
She had this great laugh

1012
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:09,870
and really soft hands.

1013
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,630
She use to rub my
back before I went to sleep

1014
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:19,310
Such a small thing but
I think about it all the time

1015
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:28,030
Why don't you ever talk about your dad?

1016
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:32,910
She was in a coma for two
years after this

1017
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:38,550
- He didn't stick around
- Oh, God, Zoe

1018
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:42,550
- I'm so sorry
- It's no big deal

1019
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:45,350
It was an important lesson for me.

1020
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:48,110
That's when I realized
that nothing lasts forever.

1021
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:53,910
So now you know everything.

1022
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:01,630
Some things can last forever

1023
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:05,470
Maybe

1024
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:08,350
So about my exam...

1025
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:12,270
I didn't exactly...

1026
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:15,950
That's weird.

1027
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:23,550
I'm confused

1028
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:26,550
- Why'd you say you'd come in the first place?
- Seemed like a good idea at the time

1029
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:29,470
Is that Zoe?

1030
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:32,310
It's so nice of you to come!

1031
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:34,230
Hi!

1032
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:37,950
Yeah, we just wanted to come and
stop by, say a quick hi and good luck

1033
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:41,750
Oh, no, you're staying. You have to
stay. Lori wants us all here for this

1034
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:43,790
I, I, I really want to stay...

1035
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:47,710
She's having a contraction

1036
01:11:59,070 --> 01:12:03,030
- So... what were you saying?
- This is Stan

1037
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:05,750
- Hi
- Of course

1038
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:08,750
- Hi, um... Congratulations
- Ooh, Thank you

1039
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:10,670
Hey, you two should get in here...

1040
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:14,590
- Oh no... no, no, no, this is your special moment...
- Oh, no, oh God, I'm not shy

1041
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:17,470
Come on, I've been through this
before. I'm not shy, Zoe

1042
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:20,190
It is really quite beautiful

1043
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:31,630
How long do we have
to stay here?

1044
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:34,590
Let's just wait till it starts
and then we'll sneak out

1045
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:42,230
Come on everyone, it's happening

1046
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:46,070
Come on, she's about to
get into the water

1047
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:49,910
The what ...?

1048
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:55,830
I'm going to be out here, Ok?

1049
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:02,350
Just relax... good.

1050
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:11,030
I know, isn't it amazing how the
human body can just open up like that?

1051
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:17,710
I think I'm going to go get
a little air. I'm feeling a little ...

1052
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:21,550
Don't you move, Zoe.
You're my focal point

1053
01:13:21,790 --> 01:13:23,510
- What?
- Oh God

1054
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:26,350
Push, push!

1055
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:30,190
Shit!

1056
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:34,030
You can't leave, you're her focal point

1057
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:35,190
Can't you use somebody else?

1058
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:37,870
She's in labour, you can't
argue with her now

1059
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:39,710
Someone grab her legs

1060
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:43,790
- Ok, lift them up...
- Push, that's it push...

1061
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:50,310
- Jesus! What is that?!
- Perfectly natural

1062
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:52,310
Sometimes the bowels just release

1063
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:54,270
Ridley...you could...?

1064
01:13:58,110 --> 01:14:01,030
No Zoe, don't you move!
You are my focal point

1065
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:03,870
But what does that even mean?

1066
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:05,750
I need to turn over,
I need to turn over, please,

1067
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:07,670
I need to turn over...
I need to turn over.

1068
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:21,950
Here comes the head!

1069
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:23,870
Give me a mirror! I want to see it!

1070
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:26,870
- No! You don't, you don't!
- No! God damn it, Zoe! Don't move!

1071
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:29,790
- I thought you wanted a mirror?
- Stan, the mirror!

1072
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:31,710
- What?
- The mirror!

1073
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:34,430
- What mirror?
- Get the mirror!

1074
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:37,390
For the love of God,
Stan, get the mirror...

1075
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,230
- Get the mirror!
- Bring it! Hurry up!

1076
01:14:44,030 --> 01:14:45,910
Hi, I'm Stan. Hi, I'm sorry.

1077
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:48,830
Give me the mirror, nobody cares!
... No... No...

1078
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:51,830
Look at all the hair!

1079
01:14:52,670 --> 01:14:53,750
It's not the baby's hair!

1080
01:14:55,550 --> 01:14:56,670
- One last... push!
- Push, push baby, push!

1081
01:14:57,470 --> 01:14:58,550
- Push!
- Aaaah!

1082
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:06,070
- Beautiful!
- Look at that!

1083
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:21,550
Everyone says that it's so beautiful

1084
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:25,390
I thought it was terrifying

1085
01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:28,270
I don't ever want to see that again

1086
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:32,990
But you want to see ours right?

1087
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:38,670
I don't know, baby... It was just...
I shouldn't have seen that.

1088
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:50,190
Hey, I was just coming by
to see if you were okay

1089
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:52,190
I was worried about
you after the exam

1090
01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:55,070
- What happened with your exam?
- Trying to tell you last night but...

1091
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:01,790
- What happened?
- I walked out on the exam

1092
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:04,630
- Why?
- I'm quitting school

1093
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:06,710
I can't believe you're pregnant

1094
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:11,270
- Why are you quitting school?
- Because if I stay in school,

1095
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:12,390
I can only work part-time

1096
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:14,390
and if I can work part-time,
I can't afford all expenses

1097
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:17,190
- I need to work, baby
- I had no idea it was this serious

1098
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:20,830
You're having a baby? I didn't know
you've been together that long.

1099
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:23,950
Well, yeah, they're not mine but...
yes, we're having a baby

1100
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:25,830
we're having twins actually

1101
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:28,590
What do you mean they're not mine?

1102
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:29,710
Oh, I didn't mean it like that

1103
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:32,470
- Why would you say that?
- I'm sorry, honey

1104
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:33,510
I'm not exactly thinking straight

1105
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:36,350
I've been up all night
watching Orca give birth

1106
01:16:38,150 --> 01:16:40,150
- I'm such an idiot
- No, Zoe

1107
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:44,030
I'm so stupid. This is...
this is not about the money

1108
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:46,830
Or that you can't afford kids

1109
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:49,630
You do not want this. That's the problem

1110
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:51,630
He always told me he didn't want kids

1111
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:52,750
Why are you still here?

1112
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:56,430
- That's it isn't it?
- Really?

1113
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:58,430
After everything we've been through
you think I don't want kids?

1114
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:00,350
- You really think that?
- That's what you just said

1115
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:02,230
It's not what I just said,
it's what you just heard.

1116
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:04,030
There is a big difference!

1117
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:06,870
I don't think you're ready for this

1118
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:10,830
Now that it's all happening, now that
you seen a woman push a baby out

1119
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:12,830
Now... it's all too real for you

1120
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:15,590
- And you're scared
- Damn right, I'm scared

1121
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:19,430
- Yeah. Aren't you scared?
- You know what I'm scared of?

1122
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:23,230
I'm scared that I'm going to have these
babies and then you're going to walk away

1123
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:26,150
You're going to say, "They're not mine",
and just going to walk away.

1124
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:28,990
Every day you’re looking for some
kind of hint that I'm leaving

1125
01:17:29,110 --> 01:17:31,030
no matter how many times
I tell you that I'm not.

1126
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:33,750
I don't know what else to do. What
else am I supposed to do?

1127
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:39,630
Nothing

1128
01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:44,310
So what are you saying?

1129
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:47,390
- Just go now
- Don't want to go!

1130
01:17:48,190 --> 01:17:49,310
- Go
- This is crazy, Zoe

1131
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:51,150
It's crazy!

1132
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:54,070
If you don't go, I'll go.

1133
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:10,310
You know what? Just so you know
when you do the autopsy here

1134
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:13,270
You better realize you have
no one to blame but yourself

1135
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:25,790
You had to come along didn't you?

1136
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:28,590
I was fine with my plan

1137
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:31,310
Totally fine with it

1138
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:27,950
You've lost your mind!

1139
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:30,910
- Just give me a boost
- If you think you're getting into this dumpster...

1140
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:34,590
I need that pillow
Ok? I can't sleep

1141
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:37,470
I will never sleep again
without that pillow

1142
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:41,550
Well, go to his house. Tell him you're
sorry, then you'll be able to sleep

1143
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:44,430
This has nothing to do
with that stupid pillow!

1144
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:46,310
I'm not going to his house, Ok?

1145
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:49,990
- He walked away from me
- No, you made him walk away

1146
01:19:50,110 --> 01:19:51,150
What do you know? You weren't even there

1147
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:53,750
I've known you for 30 years

1148
01:19:53,870 --> 01:19:55,830
I know that you would
never see this through

1149
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:57,790
I know that you don't trust people

1150
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:02,470
You and your grandmother, crazy pants.
She's been engaged to Arthur for how long?

1151
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:06,470
She's never going to marry him. Just
like you would never stay with Stan

1152
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:10,230
- Ok, Mona!
- No wonder you got a sperm donor

1153
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:13,870
He's the perfect boyfriend.
He'll never let you down

1154
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:23,470
You know, I used a sperm donor
because I wanted a baby

1155
01:20:25,550 --> 01:20:27,390
Because I wanted a family

1156
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:32,110
Because Nana is not going to live forever

1157
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:35,950
And then I'll just be me

1158
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:40,870
Go home, ok? I don't need you here

1159
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:43,630
I need my pillow

1160
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:57,990
I'm sorry... that was too far.

1161
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:02,070
Yeah, that was too far.

1162
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:05,910
But you know I'm right.

1163
01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:12,390
Stop talking. My pillow doesn't talk

1164
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:14,470
it just lies there and shuts up.

1165
01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:27,990
Don't beg, Nuts

1166
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:31,630
My God, you're stubborn

1167
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:35,510
Knock, knock. Who's ready to celebrate?

1168
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:37,510
Oh, Mona, I'm so glad you're here

1169
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:39,470
cut now I can tell both of you together.

1170
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:44,110
- I'm getting married
- What?!

1171
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:46,230
Next weekend.
We finally decided to do it

1172
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:52,750
My God!

1173
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:56,510
It finally hit me. This
man loves me and I love him

1174
01:21:57,670 --> 01:21:59,590
What the hell am I waiting for?

1175
01:22:01,390 --> 01:22:03,390
I have you to thank it, Zoe.

1176
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:07,070
Just seeing you and Stan
together, how happy you are

1177
01:22:08,110 --> 01:22:11,990
You know, the way you just thrown caution
into the wind and decided to go for it

1178
01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:14,790
I want some of that too

1179
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:21,550
- What?
- Stan and I broke up

1180
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:26,470
- He said that babies weren't his
- He didn't mean to say it

1181
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:29,350
- Tell her the whole story
- He said it

1182
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:33,190
And if he said it, he thinks it, and if
he thinks it, he feels it,

1183
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:35,950
And if he feels it what choice do I have?

1184
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:41,630
Zoe, you know that's not true. Your
just looking for another way to back out

1185
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,590
- Thank you
- I'm not going to do this

1186
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:47,550
This man has chosen to be with you
and raise your kids as his own

1187
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:52,230
You're just going to throw it all
away for some stupid word choice?

1188
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:35,310
- Look at you
- Look at you

1189
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:47,910
- I'm worried about you
- No, don't... don't worry

1190
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:54,470
I'm great. I'm great.
I'm just emotional

1191
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:56,590
Come on, let me just
finish your makeup

1192
01:23:57,390 --> 01:23:59,510
Honey, you don't always
have to be so strong

1193
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:02,230
You know, I know you learned
it me but it's no good

1194
01:24:02,350 --> 01:24:05,110
- What does it get you?
- It means that I take care of myself

1195
01:24:06,030 --> 01:24:09,110
- Just like you always did
- No, Arthur takes care of me

1196
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:11,030
He's been taking care
of me for 22 years

1197
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:12,950
I just don't want to admit it

1198
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:15,830
Zoe, stop pushing people away

1199
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:21,390
- I don't want to talk this, ok?
- Listen to me, Zoe

1200
01:24:22,310 --> 01:24:25,310
You'll never have a healthy relationship
Stan or any other man

1201
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:29,270
if you don't. You have
to learn to trust people

1202
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:53,990
- What is that?
- It's your custom stroller

1203
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:56,830
The Twin X Torpedo

1204
01:24:58,790 --> 01:25:00,830
- I didn't order this
- Your husband did... or your boyfriend.

1205
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:04,630
- I don't know exactly what is your relationship is?
- Stan?

1206
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:09,350
- When did he do that?
- About a month ago

1207
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:15,070
You don't like? Shit!
We worked really hard on this one

1208
01:25:18,110 --> 01:25:19,950
He wasn't going to leave, was he?

1209
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:29,670
I'm not really sure what
is happening here

1210
01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:32,550
We got to go get him

1211
01:25:33,310 --> 01:25:34,470
What? I'm getting married in 20 minutes

1212
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:36,310
Weddings never start on time

1213
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:39,190
We can't be late, he's 93 years old

1214
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:48,630
Stop it.

1215
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:50,590
Pick up!

1216
01:25:53,630 --> 01:25:57,310
I'm going to hurl that thing into
the fucking holy water

1217
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:35,590
Ah, is this new? The Zoe?

1218
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:37,750
Yeah, yes, it's the first
week it’s been out

1219
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:39,630
Can I have a sample? What's it like?

1220
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:44,230
It's stubborn, overly
suspicious and distrustful of men

1221
01:26:48,190 --> 01:26:51,990
- This song is taking forever
- This song is never going to be over

1222
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:08,350
What time is it people?
That's right, its conga time

1223
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:13,230
Everybody, get out there and
check those titanium hips

1224
01:27:15,870 --> 01:27:16,990
Conga time!

1225
01:27:17,870 --> 01:27:19,830
...we need to talk like two seconds.
I've been thinking...

1226
01:27:19,990 --> 01:27:22,870
- We really need to go, come on
- We have to go

1227
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:30,470
Don't seem real...

1228
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:35,990
- Please, get me out of here
- Can't find any exit signs

1229
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:39,990
- behind the tub of flowers
- I mean, who knew the Congo was this much fun

1230
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:44,630
~ She drives me crazy and I can't help myself ~

1231
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:46,630
I have rhythm all of a sudden

1232
01:27:49,710 --> 01:27:53,470
- Oh shit!
- Why is the floor wet?

1233
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:55,430
Damn it, not again

1234
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:58,270
- No, not me
- Not me

1235
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:01,110
I think my water just broke!

1236
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:03,070
What? ... Oh!

1237
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:04,870
Baby time!

1238
01:28:13,630 --> 01:28:15,470
Just stop it, stop it

1239
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:18,230
What can we do for you, darling?

1240
01:28:18,430 --> 01:28:21,150
- This dress is tight
- I can do it

1241
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:22,270
If you just want to let me... grab the strap ...

1242
01:28:24,030 --> 01:28:25,990
- Fingernails!
- Can we make a pit stop?

1243
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:43,350
- You can't park in here!
- Ok, move it, out of the way. Lady with a baby

1244
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:48,070
- Are you going to leave it there?
- Zoe, what's going on?

1245
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:49,910
- Your muffin suck ass!
- I must be going out of my mind

1246
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:51,950
What are you doing here?

1247
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:54,670
I'm trying to call you and doing the
conga, my dress is falling

1248
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:55,870
and when they say labour is
painful, they're not kidding.

1249
01:28:56,670 --> 01:28:57,750
- It really hurts
- You're in labour?

1250
01:28:58,510 --> 01:29:00,510
But the stroller came in,
it's so beautiful

1251
01:29:01,390 --> 01:29:03,350
God, that hurts!

1252
01:29:04,510 --> 01:29:06,390
- Why didn't you pick up your phone?
- Wait what?

1253
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:09,110
I called you a hundred times.
I wanted you at the wedding

1254
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:10,990
- What wedding?
- It was so beautiful

1255
01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:14,070
and then it wasn't... it was
people slipping everywhere

1256
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:15,910
Oh God, I hope nobody
got hurt

1257
01:29:16,030 --> 01:29:17,710
Ok, you're not making any sense

1258
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:19,790
But that's just it,
everything make sense

1259
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:24,630
All of a sudden everything is
just so... crystal clear.

1260
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:31,190
And the thing that's the clearest
is that I am so madly, deeply

1261
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:35,990
and completely in love with you. I can't
imagine spending another minute apart.

1262
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:53,190
Zoe, after all this time
you come in here and expect ...

1263
01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:58,990
I got to go to the hospital.
I got to go to the hospital.

1264
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:01,790
Move it, move it. Get the lead out.

1265
01:30:01,950 --> 01:30:04,870
- Zoe, wait up!
- Lets go, let’s go, let’s go

1266
01:30:06,670 --> 01:30:09,670
Listen to me, how do I know when things
gets tough you won't just run away again?

1267
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:12,390
You know? I can’t handle it,
you broke my heart...

1268
01:30:12,550 --> 01:30:14,310
you completely destroyed me.

1269
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:17,230
You destroyed me too. It's not
like this has been easy for me

1270
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:20,070
Son of a ...!

1271
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:22,070
Just, uh, breathe through it.
It's going to be ok.

1272
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,910
Don't you tell me it's going to be ok!

1273
01:30:24,070 --> 01:30:26,950
You don't know it's going to be ok.
I'm so scared!

1274
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:30,630
- It is going to be ok!
- Let's try to refrain from yelling at the patients?

1275
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:32,630
I'm not yelling! I'm just
try to get her to see my point!

1276
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:34,390
Sounds like yelling to me.

1277
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:36,470
What's it going to take for you to
believe that I'm here forever?

1278
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:38,310
You had to see a stupid stroller?

1279
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:41,150
What about the fact I've been to every
doctors appointment with you?

1280
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:43,070
I picked out names with you

1281
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:47,990
I saved this from the
very first day we met

1282
01:30:49,030 --> 01:30:51,750
It's the one that was tails up and you
flipped it to heads

1283
01:30:52,630 --> 01:30:53,630
I've kept it this whole time

1284
01:30:56,670 --> 01:30:58,470
And it's brought me the
most incredible luck

1285
01:31:01,390 --> 01:31:03,270
I can't believe you kept that

1286
01:31:04,270 --> 01:31:08,070
What about the fact that like it or not
I'll be here holding your hand through this?

1287
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:12,030
What about the fact that I'm going to be
here when these babies are born?

1288
01:31:13,870 --> 01:31:15,710
Because I love their mommy

1289
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:18,590
And what I want more than
anything else in this world

1290
01:31:21,390 --> 01:31:23,270
is to be their daddy

1291
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:30,070
But you have to promise me

1292
01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:34,830
that from now on you'll
believe me when I say I'm in

1293
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:36,830
And I'm not going anywhere

1294
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:42,510
Can you do that?

1295
01:31:49,190 --> 01:31:50,270
Can you?

1296
01:31:57,070 --> 01:31:58,750
Yes

1297
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:14,350
- Okay
- Alright, now push. Time to push.

1298
01:32:16,190 --> 01:32:17,950
Breathe, breathe

1299
01:32:26,670 --> 01:32:27,830
Remember my three rules:

1300
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:30,630
No touch, no talk,
and no eye contact

1301
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:33,430
while the dog's nose is busy
analyzing our energy

1302
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:36,190
and all the different scents on our body

1303
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:39,150
This sniffing can last from
3 seconds to 1 minute

1304
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:43,990
It's important not to interrupt the dog while
she's intent on accomplishing this ritual

1305
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:49,670
You know, one day... I'm going to tell
you girls a story of your mommy and me.

1306
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:52,590
She should write a book about that one.

1307
01:32:53,550 --> 01:32:55,430
Talk about a best-seller

1308
01:32:56,350 --> 01:32:57,430
Come here

1309
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:03,070
That's nice

1310
01:33:11,710 --> 01:33:12,790
Come here

1311
01:33:13,790 --> 01:33:16,630
It was a battle but
they finally fell asleep

1312
01:33:19,350 --> 01:33:20,470
Penny had a poop...

1313
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:23,350
Don't talk about Penny's poop
when I'm about to kiss you.

1314
01:33:46,430 --> 01:33:49,150
It's perfect. You know
what the best part is?

1315
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:52,110
We can stop in for lunch every single day.

1316
01:33:54,910 --> 01:33:56,710
- Alright, they’re here!
- Speech... speech!

1317
01:33:56,830 --> 01:34:02,630
- Hey!
- Okay, thank you, um, wow!

1318
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:04,510
Thank you all for coming

1319
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:07,350
This had been a dream me
for a long time

1320
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:13,150
I need to thank one person for
giving me the courage to do it

1321
01:34:15,070 --> 01:34:17,030
- To Zoe
- To Zoe!

1322
01:34:17,950 --> 01:34:19,830
From the moment you stole my cab

1323
01:34:20,990 --> 01:34:23,670
From the day you dissede
me at the farmers market

1324
01:34:23,870 --> 01:34:27,670
I have been totally and
completely under your spell

1325
01:34:29,470 --> 01:34:30,550
I love you

1326
01:34:31,390 --> 01:34:33,190
And you've made me the
happiest man alive

1327
01:34:34,190 --> 01:34:35,270
It was my cab

1328
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:38,910
So, come over here for a minute

1329
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:41,950
- Givme that
- What?

1330
01:34:43,790 --> 01:34:45,870
Since we do everything
backwards and in hyper speed

1331
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:48,710
I was wondered if we could
do what naturally follows

1332
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:50,670
having twins girls together

1333
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:56,270
Holly shit!

1334
01:34:57,390 --> 01:34:59,150
Will you marry me?

1335
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:10,830
- Yes
- Yeah!

1336
01:35:25,030 --> 01:35:27,070
- I can't believe it
- I know

1337
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:31,830
- Did we really just get engaged?
- Yes we did

1338
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:35,550
Soon you will be my wife

1339
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:43,350
Stan?
