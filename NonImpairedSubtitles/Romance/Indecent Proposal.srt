1
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,629
<i>Losing Diana was like</i>
<i>losing a part of me.</i>

2
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:41,530
<i>I thought nothing could change</i>
<i>the way we felt about each other.</i>

3
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,895
<i>I thought we were invincible.</i>

4
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,807
<i>Someone once said, "If you</i>
<i>want something very badly...</i>

5
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,811
<i>set it free.</i>

6
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,042
<i>If it comes back to you,</i>
<i>it's yours forever.</i>

7
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,311
<i>If it doesn't,</i>
<i>it was never yours to begin with. "</i>

8
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:05,791
<i>I knew one thing...</i>
<i>I was David's to begin with...</i>

9
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,794
<i>and he was mine.</i>

10
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:14,929
<i>You light up my life</i>

11
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,832
<i>We met in high school.</i>

12
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,497
<i>David was a senior,</i>
<i>and I was a freshman.</i>

13
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,199
<i>On Wednesdays</i>
<i>after Glee Club...</i>

14
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,674
<i>he'd drive me and my best friend</i>
<i>home from school.</i>

15
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,836
<i>I used to watch him</i>
<i>in the rearview mirror.</i>

16
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,674
<i>I fell in love with his eyes.</i>

17
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,086
<i>When I was 19, David proposed to me</i>
<i>on the pier at Paradise Cove.</i>

18
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,561
<i>Our parents were against it.</i>

19
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,598
<i>They said we were too young,</i>
<i>we really didn't know each other.</i>

20
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,700
<i>But David said that a life</i>
<i>without risk is like no life at all.</i>

21
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,005
<i>So we eloped.</i>

22
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,425
<i>I graduated</i>
<i>from architecture school...</i>

23
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,189
<i>and got a job</i>
<i>at a small firm.</i>

24
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:19,561
<i>Diana helped support us</i>
<i>by selling real estate.</i>

25
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:24,267
<i>I spent all of my free time</i>
<i>working on a design of my own.</i>

26
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,795
<i>It summed up everything about</i>
<i>architecture that mattered to me.</i>

27
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,808
<i>It was my dream house.</i>

28
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,942
D?

29
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,374
Have I ever told you
I love you?

30
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,710
No.

31
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,083
I do.

32
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,246
Still?

33
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,756
Always.

34
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,924
<i>We had our differences.</i>

35
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,192
<i>He used to take his clothes off</i>
<i>and leave them on the floor.</i>

36
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,894
<i>It made me crazy.</i>

37
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,580
What do you think this is?

38
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,387
Leaving your shoes
on the table?

39
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,757
- What is the problem?
- I don't need to do your laundry!

40
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,762
Honey, I'll pick it up.
You don't have to get violent.

41
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,764
What about this?
Peanut butter sandwich?

42
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,562
Put that down! That is serious.
You're gonna hurt somebody.

43
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,263
- Hurt somebody, huh?
- You're out of your mind.

44
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,131
Okay, now, fine.

45
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,779
Goddamn it!

46
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,076
Come on. Let's just relax.

47
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,119
Did I hurt you?
I'm sorry.

48
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,154
- Really?
- Yeah.

49
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,483
You were kidding?

50
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:08,394
D, your pants are on fire.

51
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:11,702
You have no idea.

52
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:30,187
<i>We never had much money,</i>
<i>so for entertainment...</i>

53
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:32,883
<i>David would show me architecture</i>
<i>that moved him.</i>

54
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,085
<i>But sometimes I'd have to ask...</i>

55
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,253
<i>"Why are we looking at</i>
<i>a stupid car wash?"</i>

56
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:41,394
<i>And he'd just say,</i>
<i>"No, not stupid.</i>

57
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:44,094
<i>Don't just use your eyes. "</i>

58
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:47,263
<i>He made me look at things</i>
<i>differently.</i>

59
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:53,010
David, this is a steal.
Nobody even knows about it yet.

60
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:55,603
- It's beautiful.
- You could build a house here.

61
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,739
Make a name for yourself.

62
00:06:57,816 --> 00:07:00,751
The house will be brilliant because
it will be a David Murphy house.

63
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:04,380
<i>I found an incredible property</i>
<i>in Santa Monica by the ocean.</i>

64
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:07,391
<i>It was the perfect site</i>
<i>for David's house.</i>

65
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:10,155
- How are we supposed to do it?
- Borrow money, like everybody else.

66
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:13,061
I'm telling you, these leverage-
stockbroker-buyout guys...

67
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:14,689
You should see the junk they buy.

68
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:17,735
They would go crazy
for a house of yours.

69
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:21,533
<i>It was brilliant, even though I</i>
<i>didn't understand a word of it.</i>

70
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:25,071
<i>We had to tighten our belts</i>
<i>for the loan payments...</i>

71
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:28,203
<i>but it was our future,</i>
<i>and I got to build my house.</i>

72
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:34,713
<i>Then the recession hit.</i>

73
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:37,050
<i>The real estate market dried up...</i>

74
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:39,590
<i>and I hadrt closed a sale</i>
<i>in six months.</i>

75
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:43,584
<i>Construction fell</i>
<i>to its lowest point in years.</i>

76
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:47,153
<i>People were being laid off</i>
<i>everywhere, and I was one of them.</i>

77
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:51,100
- I feel really bad about this.
- I don't understand. What happened?

78
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:54,161
The bank has called in
the demand note.

79
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,934
Can they do that?

80
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:57,941
You don't have any income
right now...

81
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:00,443
so they could attach
your assets.

82
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:03,575
What assets?

83
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:08,280
Your house.

84
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:11,653
Gotta keep up those payments.

85
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:15,254
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:29,506
David, I'm scared.

87
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:35,245
We don't have any money.

88
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:39,278
What are we gonna do?

89
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:45,920
I'll wait tables
or drive a cab or something.

90
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:58,730
I'll take care of you.

91
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:03,336
Make it go away.

92
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:12,382
<i>I was desperate.</i>

93
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,384
<i>We stood to lose everything...</i>

94
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:16,647
<i>the house I'd been building,</i>
<i>even our own home.</i>

95
00:09:18,022 --> 00:09:21,890
<i>I swallowed my pride and borrowed</i>
<i>$5,000 from my father.</i>

96
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,222
<i>It wasrt enough.</i>

97
00:09:24,796 --> 00:09:26,889
<i>We needed $50,000.</i>

98
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:32,135
Money...

99
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:40,968
D.

100
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:42,979
- What?
- Get up. Get dressed.

101
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:45,572
- What's the matter?
- I got an idea. Come on.

102
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,584
- What time is it?
- Chop, chop.

103
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:16,402
Hi! How you doing? Okay!
Cigars. Cigarettes.

104
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:17,607
Lighted yo-yos.

105
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:22,786
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, my God!

106
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:25,890
Oh, honey.
That's the spirit!

107
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:29,984
Keep 'em coming. $50,000!
That's what we want! We're winners!

108
00:10:38,002 --> 00:10:40,994
Go, skinny, skinny!
Put some money in the kitty!

109
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:43,063
Eleven. It's a winner.

110
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:47,177
We got a shooter now, folks.
We got a shooter.

111
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:49,213
A lucky, lucky lady shooter.
Keep it coming.

112
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,805
- Stack it, don't rack it.
- Seven, come!

113
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:57,849
Nine!
Denzel Washington ain't fine!

114
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:03,691
- All set, folks?
- Who's the one?

115
00:11:22,547 --> 00:11:23,639
And I have...

116
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:52,360
Why don't you put it on?

117
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:55,634
It suits you.

118
00:12:57,642 --> 00:12:59,633
Well, I can't afford it.

119
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,477
That's too bad.

120
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:05,311
Yup.

121
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,518
I really think
you oughta have the dress.

122
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:14,815
Let me buy it for you.

123
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:17,861
You want to buy me this dress?

124
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:19,362
Yeah.

125
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:22,098
Why?

126
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,498
I've enjoyed watching you.

127
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:25,934
You've earned it.

128
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:30,607
No, I haven't.

129
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:36,112
The dress is for sale.
I'm not.

130
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:42,251
Boom! Skinny, skinny!

131
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:49,886
We got a new shooter now.
Coming out. Seven.

132
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:51,451
Roll 'em now, girlfriend.

133
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,856
Seven!

134
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,573
Come on now! Come on now!

135
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:07,099
- How are you doing?
- Can't lose. I'm up over $9,000.

136
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:08,941
I can't believe it!

137
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:18,244
- It's so great!
- Hey, this is my wife, D.

138
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:21,723
These are my girls.
They're gonna be moving in.

139
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,493
Kiss 'em.

140
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:31,501
I'm winning 'cause we're winners!

141
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:33,901
Skinny, skinny!

142
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,206
- Did I ever tell you I love you?
- No.

143
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:45,442
- I do.
- Still?

144
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:46,949
Always.

145
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,566
Five thousand.

146
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,903
This little pile here?
You guessed it.

147
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:14,240
Five more, D.
What do you think this is?

148
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:15,279
Five more.

149
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:18,440
Play with it, roll around with it.
Enjoy yourself.

150
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:21,017
Oh, my.

151
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:26,083
And the grand total is...

152
00:15:28,993 --> 00:15:32,895
$25,040.

153
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:36,229
So we're halfway there,
like, in an hour.

154
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,234
I figure about...

155
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:42,167
two hours tomorrow,
we'll be home free.

156
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,707
Come here.

157
00:15:59,957 --> 00:16:01,652
What?

158
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,563
I love you.

159
00:16:11,302 --> 00:16:12,735
I know that.

160
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:16,801
No, I mean
even without the money.

161
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:50,434
Last call for wagers.
No more bets.

162
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:58,237
Come on, black.
Here we go. Here we go.

163
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:01,544
Yes!

164
00:18:09,787 --> 00:18:12,085
All right. Double zero.

165
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:13,748
No more bets, please.

166
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:23,030
Yes. We won.

167
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,993
Forty-one hundred.

168
00:18:51,062 --> 00:18:53,121
We said we wouldn't go
below 5,000.

169
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:56,166
- Do you want any more coffee?
- No, thank you.

170
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:16,448
Tails, we quit;
heads, we go for it.

171
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:38,307
Two out of three.

172
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,378
Last call for wagers.

173
00:19:42,713 --> 00:19:44,374
No more bets.

174
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:47,714
Okay, I'm feeling lucky.
I say we put it on red.

175
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:50,845
All of it. Red.

176
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:53,718
I feel red.
Do you feel red, D?

177
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:56,657
We can do this, huh?

178
00:19:59,997 --> 00:20:02,363
I'm going to put it all.
All right.

179
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,393
I'm puttir it on red.

180
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,905
Okay.

181
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,488
No, it's black.

182
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:33,086
- What are you doing?
- It's black.

183
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:40,894
No, it's red. It's red.

184
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:43,099
Go with your instinct, right?

185
00:20:43,174 --> 00:20:46,405
- No more bets.
- Come on, red.

186
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,338
Gotta get it.

187
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:55,511
Come on, red. Come on, red.

188
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:06,586
Too late, young lady.

189
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:46,101
Place your bets.

190
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,162
Bank side, player side.
All set?

191
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,673
Cards, please.

192
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:55,809
Turning for the players.

193
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,973
Pass is to the right, please.

194
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:05,518
Player draws nothing.

195
00:22:08,726 --> 00:22:10,660
Player has zero.

196
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:16,165
And set.

197
00:22:17,902 --> 00:22:19,836
Player side, banker side.

198
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:22,929
- Any other bets?
- Who's that guy?

199
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:25,532
That's John Gage.

200
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,272
He's a damn billionaire.
That's a rich son of a bitch there.

201
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:32,109
He's down over
a million dollars already.

202
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:34,811
See them little gold things
he's playing with?

203
00:22:34,885 --> 00:22:37,285
Ten thousand dollars apiece.

204
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:40,449
Every time he lays one down,
10,000 big ones.

205
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:42,458
Look at him, how cool he is.

206
00:22:42,526 --> 00:22:45,290
That son of a bitch must get more
pussy than you can shake a stick at.

207
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,126
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend.

208
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:49,132
- Player wins.
- What y'all doing, gambling?

209
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,725
It's about time.

210
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:54,532
- Y'all married?
- Let's go.

211
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:56,835
- Stick around, gamble a little.
- Excuse me.

212
00:22:57,808 --> 00:22:59,173
Excuse me.

213
00:23:00,444 --> 00:23:02,639
Would you mind
lending me your wife?

214
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:04,738
Is that your wife?

215
00:23:04,815 --> 00:23:06,214
Excuse me?

216
00:23:07,985 --> 00:23:09,475
For luck.

217
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:12,012
You'd have to ask her.

218
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:14,918
May I?

219
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:18,861
- Go for it.
- I don't think it's a good idea.

220
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:21,420
- We should just go.
- Just for a moment?

221
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:23,933
- I'll go.
- Go ahead. It might be fun.

222
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:25,696
What do we got to lose?

223
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,567
- Well?
- He ain't gonna bite.

224
00:23:27,638 --> 00:23:30,106
You go and see what happens.

225
00:23:30,174 --> 00:23:32,165
- Go ahead.
- We'll be here backing you up.

226
00:23:33,077 --> 00:23:34,669
Thank you.

227
00:23:34,745 --> 00:23:37,839
See if she can get a little
of that money from him.

228
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:40,281
Do you think
she'll ever come back?

229
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,453
I'm just bullshittir you.

230
00:23:46,257 --> 00:23:47,690
Have a seat.

231
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:51,091
I've been losing all day long.
You appeared, I win my first hand.

232
00:23:51,162 --> 00:23:53,790
You brought me luck.

233
00:23:53,864 --> 00:23:56,355
I'd say that's a sign.

234
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,459
Wouldrt you?

235
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:03,739
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

236
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:05,241
Candy?

237
00:24:09,013 --> 00:24:10,139
Place your bets.

238
00:24:11,215 --> 00:24:13,649
- Bank side, player side.
- Hundred thousand.

239
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,084
- Any other bets?
- Just like that?

240
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:19,222
- Just like that.
- All bets set.

241
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,453
Twenty-dollar tie-in.

242
00:24:24,895 --> 00:24:25,987
Not like that.

243
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:29,764
Sorry.

244
00:24:31,702 --> 00:24:34,899
All bets set. Cards, please.

245
00:24:37,508 --> 00:24:39,942
Turning for the players.

246
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,443
What we want...

247
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:45,576
what we need...
is a nine.

248
00:24:52,857 --> 00:24:54,848
We don't like that.

249
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:57,689
Player draws nothing.
Cards for the bank, please.

250
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:00,788
Bank's a winner with
a natural eight. Pay the bank.

251
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,570
I guess I'm not so lucky
after all.

252
00:25:07,638 --> 00:25:09,333
Do you like cards?

253
00:25:10,207 --> 00:25:11,435
Not especially.

254
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,977
Wish I had asked you sooner.

255
00:25:14,044 --> 00:25:15,170
Dice?

256
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,541
Yeah, I guess so.

257
00:25:21,452 --> 00:25:23,511
Sam.

258
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:25,145
Mr. G.

259
00:25:27,224 --> 00:25:28,452
One.

260
00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:31,127
Excuse me, Mr. G.

261
00:25:40,938 --> 00:25:43,839
- Maybe I should go.
- This shouldn't take too long.

262
00:25:43,908 --> 00:25:46,138
- What?
- This.

263
00:25:53,017 --> 00:25:54,450
Now...

264
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,919
I hope you find this
interesting.

265
00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:01,216
Pit. Tadross.

266
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:02,884

267
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,962

268
00:26:05,095 --> 00:26:06,392

270
00:26:13,904 --> 00:26:16,065
Yes, sir. Thank you.

271
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:17,697
Goes for $ 1 million.

272
00:26:17,774 --> 00:26:19,708
It's a bet.

273
00:26:21,044 --> 00:26:22,841
That's a lot of money.

274
00:26:22,913 --> 00:26:25,507
There you are, Mr. G.
One million dollars.

275
00:26:28,785 --> 00:26:30,116
Oh, boy!

276
00:26:53,343 --> 00:26:54,640
Bet it all.

277
00:26:57,681 --> 00:26:59,114

00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:23,672
Pick two.

281
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:32,809
Now just throw a seven.

282
00:27:33,717 --> 00:27:36,242
You wanna throw an 11,
that's all right too.

283
00:27:42,492 --> 00:27:44,426
Arert you forgetting something?

I think I should.

289
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:29,802
Credit my account.

290
00:28:29,873 --> 00:28:31,966
Excuse me. Excuse me.

291
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:34,875
Sweetie, that was amazing.
That was incredible.

292
00:28:34,945 --> 00:28:36,879
Oh, my God! Unbelievable.

293
00:28:36,947 --> 00:28:38,972
Hi. John Gage.

294
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:41,017
Oh, hi. David Murphy.

295
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:43,245
- Hi, David.
- Congratulations.

296
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,254
This is my wife Diana.
I guess you met.

297
00:28:45,322 --> 00:28:46,653
Hi. Diana?

298
00:28:46,723 --> 00:28:49,749
- Diana.
- Hi. Thank you both.

299
00:28:50,694 --> 00:28:52,889
Very generous of you, David.
Are you staying at the hotel?

300
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:55,591
- Actually, we're just leaving.
- You're leaving?

301
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:58,099
- We're on our way out.
- No, don't do that.

302
00:28:58,168 --> 00:29:00,659
We got to celebrate.
Let me arrange a room for you here.

303
00:29:00,737 --> 00:29:03,865
- That's very nice, but...
- I insist.

304
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,807
Please, it's the least I can do.
Okay?

305
00:29:06,877 --> 00:29:09,141
Really, just sign for it.
Anything you want.

306
00:29:10,213 --> 00:29:12,943
Oh, there's some lovely shops
off the lobby.

307
00:29:13,016 --> 00:29:14,847
Have you seen 'em?

308
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,553
Let's go.

309
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,034
How 'bout that?

310
00:29:35,705 --> 00:29:37,832
Wow.

311
00:29:37,908 --> 00:29:39,933
Hey, D. What do you think?

312
00:29:40,911 --> 00:29:43,106
<i>Godfather?</i>

313
00:29:47,984 --> 00:29:50,384
You won a million dollars today.

314
00:29:50,453 --> 00:29:51,920
He won it.

315
00:29:52,989 --> 00:29:54,923
You won it for him.

316
00:30:02,165 --> 00:30:04,099
This feels nice.

317
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,661
Don't get it.
Just stay right here.

318
00:30:08,738 --> 00:30:10,171
- Okay.
- Okay?

319
00:30:19,216 --> 00:30:21,707

from John Gage.

322
00:30:29,826 --> 00:30:32,556
- Oh, well, thank him for us.
- I'll do that.

323
00:30:32,629 --> 00:30:36,190
Mr. Gage is hosting a gathering
tonight at his suite at 9:00.

324
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:39,201
If you can find the time in your
schedule, he'd be most pleased.

325
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:44,597
- Look what you got.
- What?

326
00:30:45,675 --> 00:30:47,302
Gift from Gage.

327
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:50,445
Really?

328
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:52,809
Open it up.

329
00:31:04,928 --> 00:31:06,623
That's $5,000.

330
00:31:07,864 --> 00:31:09,126
How do you know that?

331
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,068
I saw it in a store downstairs.

332
00:31:14,738 --> 00:31:17,298
Oh. Lucky for him
you like black.

333
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,468
Yeah.

334
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:41,029
<i>It's not the pale moon</i>

335
00:31:41,097 --> 00:31:44,123
<i>That excites me</i>

336
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:50,571
<i>That thrills</i>

337
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,302
<i>And delights me</i>

338
00:31:55,178 --> 00:31:58,477
<i>Oh, no</i>

339
00:32:01,117 --> 00:32:04,021
<i>It's just the nearness</i>

340
00:32:04,154 --> 00:32:08,284
<i>Of you</i>

341
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:17,191
<i>It's not your</i>

342
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:19,201
<i>Sweet</i>

343
00:32:20,737 --> 00:32:23,103
<i>Conversation</i>

344
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:29,209
<i>That brings</i>

345
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,147
<i>This sensation</i>

346
00:32:34,951 --> 00:32:36,748
<i>Oh, no</i>

347
00:32:38,922 --> 00:32:43,291
<i>It's just the nearness</i>

348
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,954
<i>Of you</i>

349
00:32:53,136 --> 00:32:57,436
In the future, just check into
a hotel and start all over again.

350
00:32:59,376 --> 00:33:01,571
Stick 'em under the sheets.

351
00:33:03,313 --> 00:33:04,803
That's strange. Am I right?

352
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:13,581
- Good night.
- Thanks.

353
00:33:27,537 --> 00:33:29,198
Who is that guy, Shackleford?

354
00:33:30,807 --> 00:33:33,435
Someone who works for me.

355
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,808
Someone I trust.

356
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:40,816
He killed someone once.

357
00:33:45,355 --> 00:33:46,379
Tell me...

358
00:33:46,456 --> 00:33:50,290
where do you see yourself
in, say, ten years?

359
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:55,559
I wouldn't mind being
a billionaire like yourself.

360
00:33:56,933 --> 00:33:58,958
Nice shot.
I mean, beyond money.

361
00:33:59,035 --> 00:34:01,663
What would satisfy you completely,
let you sleep well at night?

362
00:34:02,973 --> 00:34:05,237
What, are you saying
you're not satisfied?

363
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:07,566
Who is?

364
00:34:08,478 --> 00:34:10,639
I am.

365
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:14,645
She mean it?

366
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,084
I hope so.

367
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:21,188
Well, then you may not have won
in Vegas, but you're a lucky man...

368
00:34:21,258 --> 00:34:23,522
'cause I got money, security,
I have businesses...

369
00:34:23,593 --> 00:34:27,188
but you have something
that I just don't have.

370
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:30,256
I guess there's limits
to what money can buy.

371
00:34:31,334 --> 00:34:32,528
Not many.

372
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:36,171
Some things aren't for sale.

373
00:34:37,574 --> 00:34:39,166
Such as?

374
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:41,838
You can't buy people.

375
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:46,678
That's naive, Diana.
I buy people every day.

376
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,117
In business, maybe, but not
when real emotions are involved.

377
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:54,555
You're saying you can't buy love?
That's a bit of a cliché.

378
00:34:55,825 --> 00:34:57,588
It's absolutely true.

379
00:34:57,661 --> 00:34:59,094
Is it?

380
00:34:59,162 --> 00:35:01,153
What do you think?

381
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:03,961
- I agree with Diana.
- You do?

382
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:07,561
Let's test the cliché.

383
00:35:11,808 --> 00:35:13,241
Suppose...

384
00:35:14,711 --> 00:35:17,111
I were to offer you $ 1 million...

385
00:35:20,317 --> 00:35:22,251
for one night with your wife.

386
00:35:28,258 --> 00:35:30,385
I'd assume you're kidding.

387
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,394
Let's pretend I'm not.

388
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:36,091
What would you say?

389
00:35:38,134 --> 00:35:40,329
He'd tell you to go to hell.

390
00:35:42,138 --> 00:35:44,470
I didn't hear him.

391
00:35:45,342 --> 00:35:47,833
I'd tell you to go to hell.

392
00:36:00,023 --> 00:36:03,288
That's a reflex answer because
you view it as hypothetical.

393
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,158
But let's say that there were
real money behind it.

394
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:10,490
I'm not kidding.

395
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:12,728
A million dollars.

396
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:16,135
The night would come and go,
but the money could last a lifetime.

397
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:18,140
Think of it.

398
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:21,143
A million dollars.

399
00:36:23,113 --> 00:36:25,581
A lifetime of security...

400
00:36:25,649 --> 00:36:27,480
for one night.

401
00:36:28,551 --> 00:36:31,418
Don't answer right away.

402
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:32,978
But consider it.

403
00:36:34,057 --> 00:36:35,888
Seriously.

404
00:36:37,327 --> 00:36:39,557
We're positive, okay?

405
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:46,099
Then you've answered my question
and you've proved your point.

406
00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:49,502
There are limits
to what money can buy.

407
00:36:49,572 --> 00:36:52,769
It's late, and I hate to admit it,
but I have a meeting.

408
00:36:54,277 --> 00:36:56,541
May I have one dance?

409
00:36:56,613 --> 00:36:59,446
Of course, with your permission.

410
00:36:59,516 --> 00:37:01,882
You know something? I think you
better get on to that meeting.

411
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:04,044
You don't want to miss out
on your next billion.

412
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:08,522
Understood.
I wouldn't part with her either.

413
00:37:11,261 --> 00:37:12,694
Good night.

414
00:38:09,618 --> 00:38:11,085
Can't sleep?

415
00:38:14,123 --> 00:38:15,556
No.

416
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,893
Me neither.

417
00:38:25,701 --> 00:38:28,226
I just keep thinking about it.

418
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,065
It's so weird, isn't it?

419
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:37,211
Yeah.

420
00:38:43,285 --> 00:38:45,913
David, I think you
want me to do it.

421
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:52,593
What are you talking about?

422
00:38:53,662 --> 00:38:55,755
Don't be ridiculous.

423
00:38:57,967 --> 00:39:00,265
Well, maybe we should
just talk about it.

424
00:39:00,336 --> 00:39:02,861
I don't want you to do it.

425
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:11,377
- But you'd let me do it?
- No.

426
00:39:17,353 --> 00:39:20,015
Why? Do you want to do it?

427
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:23,357
No.

428
00:39:26,028 --> 00:39:27,461
But I would.

429
00:39:28,898 --> 00:39:30,388
I'd do it for you.

430
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:34,568
For me?

431
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,244
I can't believe
we're even talkir about this.

432
00:39:49,485 --> 00:39:51,851
Think about what this money
could do for us...

433
00:39:51,921 --> 00:39:54,082
what it could do
for our future.

434
00:39:56,725 --> 00:39:59,558
You could finish your house.

435
00:39:59,628 --> 00:40:01,755
You could pay your dad back...

436
00:40:02,898 --> 00:40:04,832
get rid of our debts.

437
00:40:06,602 --> 00:40:09,093
After all,
it wouldn't mean anything.

438
00:40:09,171 --> 00:40:11,401
It's just my body.

439
00:40:11,474 --> 00:40:13,408
It's not my mind.

440
00:40:13,476 --> 00:40:15,103
It's not my heart.

441
00:40:17,746 --> 00:40:21,113
You think we could
do something like that?

442
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:31,455
We both slept with other people
before we were married, right?

443
00:40:31,527 --> 00:40:32,960
Yeah.

444
00:40:34,196 --> 00:40:36,960
So we'd just have to
look at it like that.

445
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,463
I slept with Bubba Aruzio,
for God's sake.

446
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:45,473
If I can sleep with Bubba,
I can sleep with anyone.

447
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:48,476
- You slept with Bubba?
- You knew.

448
00:40:48,544 --> 00:40:51,206
No, I didn't know that.
When did you sleep with Bubba?

449
00:40:52,715 --> 00:40:55,912
When you were off sleeping
with that slut, Olivia Daigle.

450
00:40:55,985 --> 00:40:58,146
Olivia Deagle.
And she wasrt a slut.

451
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,780
Olivia Beagle.

452
00:41:00,856 --> 00:41:02,517
Let me in.

453
00:41:02,591 --> 00:41:04,422
- She wasrt a slut.
- Yes, she was.

454
00:41:04,493 --> 00:41:05,926
- She wasrt.
- She was.

455
00:41:05,995 --> 00:41:07,758
She wasrt.

456
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,263
Unfortunately.

457
00:41:13,502 --> 00:41:15,834
Thank God we can laugh about it.

458
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:18,669
Yeah.

459
00:41:18,741 --> 00:41:21,335
That's easy to say now.
After...

460
00:41:26,815 --> 00:41:29,283
We'd just have to forget
it ever happened.

461
00:41:32,855 --> 00:41:35,790
And never discuss it,
not even once.

462
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:41,627
I mean, because nothing
will have happened.

463
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,359
Nothing that matters, anyway.

464
00:41:55,644 --> 00:41:58,636
We have a brilliant script,
really very special.

465
00:41:58,714 --> 00:42:00,648
- Major.
- It's a vehicle...

466
00:42:00,716 --> 00:42:02,581
a comeback vehicle
for Diana Ross.

467
00:42:02,651 --> 00:42:04,915
With Billy Ray Cyrus.
It's kind of <i>A Star Is Born.</i>

468
00:42:04,987 --> 00:42:06,113
So...

469
00:42:06,188 --> 00:42:08,554
your first screenplay sold
for half a million.

470
00:42:08,624 --> 00:42:11,559
- Should've been two.
- Except our lawyer caved in on us.

471
00:42:11,627 --> 00:42:13,060
That won't happen again.

472
00:42:13,128 --> 00:42:15,323
We're gonna get a lawyer
that's tough, that's savvy.

473
00:42:15,397 --> 00:42:18,059
Someone who will step
on his grandmother for us.

474
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:22,062
<i>Mr. Green, a David Murphy</i>
<i>would like to speak to you.</i>

475
00:42:22,137 --> 00:42:24,071
<i>He says it's urgent.</i>

476
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:26,266
Put him on the speaker.
This is an old college buddy.

477
00:42:26,342 --> 00:42:28,572
- It'll only take a second.
<i>- Jeremy?</i>

478
00:42:28,644 --> 00:42:31,272
Davey, I'm in the middle
of a meeting. What's up?

479
00:42:31,347 --> 00:42:33,872
<i>Well, listen,</i>
<i>we need you to close a deal.</i>

480
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:36,417
- What kind of deal?
<i>- A very big deal.</i>

481
00:42:36,485 --> 00:42:38,419
Ooh, big deal. Go on.

482
00:42:38,487 --> 00:42:40,978
<i>We're in Vegas at the Hilton.</i>

483
00:42:41,056 --> 00:42:43,650
<i>We met John Gage.</i>
<i>You know who he is?</i>

484
00:42:43,726 --> 00:42:48,095
Sure, I know who he is.
A billionaire and major poon hound.

485
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:50,591
<i>He is?</i>

486
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,133
Go on.

487
00:42:52,201 --> 00:42:54,533
<i>He offered us a million dollars.</i>

488
00:42:54,603 --> 00:42:57,766
Million dollars?
For what, your kidneys?

489
00:42:59,975 --> 00:43:02,239
<i>For one night with Diana.</i>

490
00:43:05,547 --> 00:43:07,481
What do you mean?

491
00:43:07,549 --> 00:43:10,347
- One night, like...
<i>- Yes.</i>

492
00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:15,855
Could you excuse me for a second?

493
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:22,763
Let me get this straight.

494
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:26,530
He offered you a million dollars
for a night with your wife?

495
00:43:26,602 --> 00:43:28,536
As in your wife Diana?

496
00:43:29,605 --> 00:43:31,869
And you agreed to it?
I don't know what to say.

497
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,408
How could you
do something like that?

498
00:43:34,476 --> 00:43:36,410
How could you negotiate
without me?

499
00:43:36,478 --> 00:43:39,276
Never negotiate
without your lawyer. Never!

500
00:43:39,348 --> 00:43:41,646
For a woman like Diana, I could have
got you at least two million!

501
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:47,120
Obviously, you don't want to
get screwed, and then screwed.

502
00:43:47,189 --> 00:43:49,885
Hey, stay, please.
This is damage control.

503
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:51,949
Two seconds. Eat cookies.
There's cookies coming.

504
00:43:52,027 --> 00:43:53,619
You don't understand.
We've heard enough.

505
00:43:53,696 --> 00:43:55,926
- You're hired.
- We love your style.

506
00:43:55,998 --> 00:43:58,626
Great. Gladys, check
the gentlemers schedules.

507
00:43:58,701 --> 00:44:01,169
- Call me next week. Wednesday?
- Great.

508
00:44:01,236 --> 00:44:02,635
See you then.
Thanks for coming.

509
00:44:02,705 --> 00:44:05,071
- No. Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

510
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:08,733
Okay, David,
before we go any further...

511
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:12,907
let's get the moral issue
out of the way.

512
00:44:12,981 --> 00:44:15,575
<i>- Leave that to us.</i>
- I was referring to my fee.

513
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:17,278
I get five percent.

514
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:21,253
Do you want to elaborate
on the verification clause?

515
00:44:21,323 --> 00:44:23,257
Verification.

516
00:44:23,325 --> 00:44:27,596
That means you pay even if
the relationship isn't consummated.

517
00:44:28,496 --> 00:44:31,124
You mean, if I'm impotent.

518
00:44:31,933 --> 00:44:34,595
It's important for a lawyer
to cover contingencies.

519
00:44:35,737 --> 00:44:36,999
I can live with that.

520
00:44:37,072 --> 00:44:39,006
The John Garfield clause?

521
00:44:39,074 --> 00:44:42,043
That's if you die in the act.

522
00:44:45,246 --> 00:44:48,272
I have no problem with that either.
Can I have your pen?

523
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:59,058
- You're pretty good, you know?
- Thank you.

524
00:44:59,127 --> 00:45:01,891
You should come work for me.

525
00:45:12,807 --> 00:45:14,741
We have a deal.

526
00:45:18,913 --> 00:45:21,507
A million dollars will be deposited
in your casino account...

527
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:23,346
in the morning.

528
00:45:28,823 --> 00:45:29,915
So.

529
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,921
So.

530
00:45:34,696 --> 00:45:36,425
So.

531
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:40,858
You can go.

532
00:45:40,935 --> 00:45:42,232
Gentlemen...

533
00:45:42,303 --> 00:45:44,999
I think it's time
for men of good will to...

534
00:45:45,073 --> 00:45:47,405
take leave of one another.

535
00:46:13,635 --> 00:46:15,899
It's all right.

536
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:18,063
I don't bite.

537
00:46:20,475 --> 00:46:21,908
So...

538
00:46:23,378 --> 00:46:25,312
what, should I go undress?

539
00:46:30,652 --> 00:46:34,053
Cheer up. You got to find a more
creative way to think about this.

540
00:46:34,122 --> 00:46:38,616
Look at it like an episode
of <i>The Dating Game</i> that went awry.

541
00:46:38,693 --> 00:46:41,491
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

542
00:46:41,563 --> 00:46:44,589
<i>we wish to welcome you</i>
<i>to ourjamboree.</i>

543
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:47,499
First punch, over he went.
I couldn't believe it.

544
00:46:47,569 --> 00:46:50,732
I know we could have
gotten two million.

545
00:46:50,805 --> 00:46:52,238
Here's your Buddha.

546
00:46:52,307 --> 00:46:54,935
Davey, no point getting out
the crying towel.

547
00:46:55,009 --> 00:46:56,806
You got a million bucks, buddy.

548
00:46:56,878 --> 00:46:59,039
A million bucks.

549
00:46:59,114 --> 00:47:01,844
<i>Take the ribbon from your hair</i>

550
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:04,976
She's an amazing woman.
She really is.

551
00:47:05,053 --> 00:47:07,021
Couldrt have gotten 500
for my girlfriend.

552
00:47:07,088 --> 00:47:09,022
Not that I'd do that.

553
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:11,820
But it's okay that you did.

554
00:47:11,893 --> 00:47:14,123
This is a different situation.

555
00:47:14,195 --> 00:47:16,425
She agreed to it.
You've gotta remember that.

556
00:47:16,498 --> 00:47:19,262
It's not like it's hard duty.

557
00:47:19,334 --> 00:47:20,801
He's a great-looking guy.

558
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:23,963
For a million bucks,
I'd sleep with him.

559
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,438
Maybe not.

560
00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:29,841
Hey, buddy!

561
00:47:41,756 --> 00:47:43,621
Come on.

562
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,233
Come on!

563
00:47:56,604 --> 00:47:58,868
What have I done?

564
00:48:12,787 --> 00:48:14,379
D!

565
00:48:14,455 --> 00:48:16,685
It's me!

566
00:48:23,231 --> 00:48:26,098
Where is she?
Where's my wife?

567
00:48:27,769 --> 00:48:29,532
Where is she?

568
00:48:32,407 --> 00:48:33,499
Diana!

569
00:48:34,976 --> 00:48:36,443
Please!

570
00:48:36,511 --> 00:48:38,445
Where did she go?
What happened to her?

571
00:48:38,513 --> 00:48:40,845
- Where'd they go?
- Up, up.

572
00:48:40,915 --> 00:48:42,542
Up where?

573
00:49:03,438 --> 00:49:04,871
D!

574
00:53:37,177 --> 00:53:39,338
They sent for me.

575
00:53:39,412 --> 00:53:41,346
They said you were ready.

576
00:53:54,828 --> 00:53:56,489
Come here.

577
00:54:18,985 --> 00:54:21,078
You missed a button.

578
00:54:28,662 --> 00:54:30,857
Thank you.

579
00:54:32,332 --> 00:54:35,233
I want to show you something.

580
00:54:50,517 --> 00:54:51,779
What happened?

581
00:54:52,852 --> 00:54:55,377
Lights went off.

582
00:54:57,357 --> 00:54:59,825
I see that. Why?

583
00:55:03,463 --> 00:55:04,896
Look.

584
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:13,300
Can you turn those off too?

585
00:55:16,476 --> 00:55:18,410
I'm working on it.

586
00:55:23,984 --> 00:55:25,645
Who made the decision?

587
00:55:29,256 --> 00:55:31,087
We both did.

588
00:55:31,157 --> 00:55:32,624
Nah.

589
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,190
Do it for your own reasons,
or don't do it.

590
00:55:38,398 --> 00:55:41,265
- You don't know him.
- I know he didn't stop you.

591
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,593
If you were mine...

592
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:50,102
I wouldn't share you
with anyone.

593
00:55:56,349 --> 00:55:59,318
You have no right
to judge David.

594
00:56:01,888 --> 00:56:04,482
You're the one
who has to buy women.

595
00:56:04,557 --> 00:56:06,491
You think I have to buy women?

596
00:56:11,464 --> 00:56:13,398
Why me, then?

597
00:56:13,466 --> 00:56:15,900
I bought you because
you said you couldn't be bought.

598
00:56:18,571 --> 00:56:20,903
I can't be bought.

599
00:56:20,974 --> 00:56:23,408
We're just gonna fuck,
as I understand it.

600
00:56:25,378 --> 00:56:27,209
You might enjoy it.

601
00:56:28,581 --> 00:56:30,549
Don't bet on it.

602
00:56:34,154 --> 00:56:35,587
I think I will.

603
00:56:40,994 --> 00:56:42,928
Heads, we do...

604
00:56:42,996 --> 00:56:45,931
tails, we call the whole thing off,
turn the boat around, go home.

605
00:56:45,999 --> 00:56:47,557
No hard feelings.

606
00:56:48,501 --> 00:56:50,696
What do you say?

607
00:56:52,172 --> 00:56:53,764
It's your party.

608
00:56:55,842 --> 00:56:57,776
This is my lucky dollar...

609
00:56:59,012 --> 00:57:00,707
so I can't lose.

610
00:57:22,802 --> 00:57:24,099
Trust me.

611
00:57:25,805 --> 00:57:28,569
Nothing's gonna happen
you don't choose.

612
00:59:42,843 --> 00:59:44,970
- I love you.
- I love you.

613
01:00:00,995 --> 01:00:03,259
<i>I told myself it was over...</i>

614
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:06,094
<i>like a dream that vanishes</i>
<i>in the morning light...</i>
