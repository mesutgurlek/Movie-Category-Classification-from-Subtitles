1
00:00:33,692 --> 00:00:35,990
It was a day like no other.

2
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:42,327
It was a day I had always dreamed of.

3
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:45,429
A day I would never forget.

4
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:51,598
Will you marry this woman
and take her to your heart,

5
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,508
forever devoted and forever young?

6
00:00:54,613 --> 00:00:56,274
I will.

7
00:00:56,348 --> 00:01:00,944
And will you marry this man
and take him to your heart,

8
00:01:01,052 --> 00:01:03,520
forever devoted and forever young?

9
00:01:03,622 --> 00:01:05,556
I will.

10
00:01:05,657 --> 00:01:08,820
Would you now place the ring on her finger?

11
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,657
I now declare...

12
00:01:17,068 --> 00:01:19,969
What a shame we had uninvited guests.

13
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,934
I"ll have what I came for this day!

14
00:01:28,446 --> 00:01:30,311
Jack politely asked him to leave.

15
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:32,514
Kiss steel, bastard!

16
00:01:45,797 --> 00:01:47,492
Jack!

17
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:06,608
Hold tight! I"m coming!

18
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,614
His temper flared,
but he fought like a gentleman.

19
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:41,509
My one true love had fought bravely,
but it wasn't enough.

20
00:02:53,398 --> 00:02:55,457
There was only room for one more.

21
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:58,161
It was either my love or myself.

22
00:02:58,236 --> 00:03:02,605
- You take it, my love.
- Never! Those maggots will not have you.

23
00:03:02,774 --> 00:03:05,402
They will not have me for long.

24
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,776
I have consumption
and will be dead before the year is out.

25
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,010
You were gonna marry me
with consumption? Why didn"t you tell me?

26
00:03:13,084 --> 00:03:15,245
I didn"t want to spoil things.

27
00:03:15,353 --> 00:03:16,615
- Go.
- No!

28
00:03:16,688 --> 00:03:19,020
Live to fight another day.

29
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:24,987
Whatever makes you happy.

30
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:34,002
With Jack, my happiness always came first.

31
00:03:35,774 --> 00:03:37,639
I faced my fate alone.

32
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:40,835
The 10 turned to 20, the 20 to 40.

33
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:44,176
Could this be the end of
my freedom, my salvation, my...

34
00:03:44,249 --> 00:03:46,843
Hey, gorgeous!

35
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:50,051
Hiya, Joanie!

36
00:04:03,735 --> 00:04:05,828
What happened?

37
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:41,127
"Was this the end of my freedom,
my salvation?"

38
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,668
My career?

39
00:05:58,616 --> 00:06:00,846
Gorgeous day. Huh, gorgeous?

40
00:06:00,952 --> 00:06:03,386
We got blue skies,

41
00:06:03,454 --> 00:06:06,787
nice warm water and a cold beer.

42
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:11,793
Honey, did you get any more Buds?

43
00:06:11,863 --> 00:06:16,823
No, I just didn"t have time today
to ravage the Riviera for your beer.

44
00:06:17,802 --> 00:06:21,067
- Tough day, huh?
- Yeah, you could say it was tough.

45
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:24,734
But then when the going gets tough,
the tough...

46
00:06:27,312 --> 00:06:29,177
I don"t know what the tough do.

47
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,340
I don"t know what the pirates do,
or what anybody does.

48
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,908
- Jack...
- Oh, honey. I know, baby. I know.

49
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,957
Look out there. What do you see?

50
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:44,918
- Bloomingdale"s?
- No.

51
00:06:44,996 --> 00:06:46,486
Greece.

52
00:06:46,564 --> 00:06:50,261
Yeah. Mykonos, Lesbos, ouzo, olive oil.
Honey, we"re going.

53
00:06:50,335 --> 00:06:54,396
Wait. I thought you said that
we were going back to New York for a while.

54
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:57,474
Absolutely.
When the summer"s over we"re going.

55
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:01,808
Oh, Jack, we"ve been on this boat
half a year now. I need shore leave.

56
00:07:01,913 --> 00:07:05,508
I promised Gloria I"d finish that book
three months ago, and I can"t.

57
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,676
I don"t know what happens next.

58
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:10,550
I thought you wanted
to sail around the world with me.

59
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:13,818
Well, I do, but not all of it this week.

60
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:17,022
I mean, Jack, this is just becoming a blur.

61
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:21,894
Exotic ports and great parties
and spectacular sunsets...

62
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:23,627
It"s not enough.

63
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,965
It"s not enough?!

64
00:07:26,037 --> 00:07:30,406
You sound like someone who"s got what they
wanted and now don"t want what they got.

65
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:33,966
- I wanna do something serious.
- Serious? Come on!

66
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:36,513
How much romance can one woman take?

67
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,845
Joan Wilder?

68
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,987
From your most devoted friend.

69
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:46,781
Thank you.

70
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:57,364
"This afternoon we shall meet... awaiting
the moment. " What"s this afternoon?

71
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:02,270
- Must be somebody coming to the reception.
- That"s not till next Tuesday.

72
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:06,366
This is "next Tuesday," Jack.

73
00:08:22,593 --> 00:08:27,621
- Jack, you said you were getting a car.
- If I knew it was Tuesday, I would"ve. Sorry.

74
00:08:27,698 --> 00:08:29,791
That"s all right.

75
00:08:29,867 --> 00:08:33,234
Whaddaya say we spin that roulette wheel
while we"re there?

76
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,397
Sounds great.

77
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,414
Jack.

78
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,384
- Yeah?
- She can"t leave now.

79
00:08:48,453 --> 00:08:51,217
- Why not?
- What do you mean, "Why not?"

80
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,814
- Oh, my God.
- I"m your biggest fan!

81
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:57,224
- I read all your books.
- Thank you.

82
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:01,594
I"m so happy to see you.

83
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,897
- This is my publisher. Gloria Horne.
- Oh, your publisher.

84
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,438
- And this is...
- You are Mr Wilder?

85
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,839
No, I"m Mr Colton. Jack Colton.

86
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:14,241
What do you do, Mr Colton?

87
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,438
Casino work.

88
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:21,076
Yeah. I think I"ll go downstairs and punch in.
Excuse me, excuse me.

89
00:09:21,152 --> 00:09:23,677
- But...
- I"ll be back!

90
00:09:25,156 --> 00:09:27,454
God, I"ve got to have a drink!

91
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,959
Literary functions are not Jack"s speed.

92
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:33,963
I mean, his favorite author
is the man who wrote "Pull Tab to Open".

93
00:09:34,065 --> 00:09:37,967
- I am his favorite author.
- You saying it"s none of my business?

94
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:41,095
Let me tell you, Jack is not the marrying kind.

95
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:45,233
I am worried. You"re the girl who
never gets a book back late to the library.

96
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:50,508
You are three months past your deadline.
What gives? Un scotch, double.

97
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:55,518
My heartjust isn"t in it. Romance
just doesn"t seem real to me anymore.

98
00:09:55,586 --> 00:10:00,114
Real? You don"t write "real. " You write
about people that sail off into the sunset.

99
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:04,924
- And the next day when the sun comes up?
- There is no next day in romance.

100
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:08,363
Stop confusing real life
with a romantic novel.

101
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,294
- Joanie, just finish it.
- I can"t.

102
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,463
After 17 books,
I don"t know how it ends anymore.

103
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,566
Then permit me to tell you.

104
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,938
It doesn"t end.

105
00:10:24,015 --> 00:10:27,883
It only begins anew
when you journey down the Nile with me.

106
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:32,083
- Have you got the right woman?
- No.

107
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:38,422
My name is Omar Khalifa and I have traveled
1,000 miles to tell you I need you.

108
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:41,327
- You sent me the flowers.
- They pale by your beauty.

109
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,093
Oh, Mary!

110
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:47,365
- I read about you.
- Yes, I know. Time magazine.

111
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:52,033
Well, I"m afraid the Western press
cannot understand the spirit of my vision.

112
00:10:52,143 --> 00:10:55,044
You are a writer. You can understand.

113
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:59,576
So, Joan Wilder,
you must come and write my story.

114
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:03,049
I only write romance novels.

115
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:07,147
Yes. And you haven"t finished the one
you"re working on right now.

116
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:12,326
You are a gifted storyteller.
You create heroes in a world of cynics.

117
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:16,465
Journey down the Nile with me
and I"ll give you a chance to record history.

118
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:19,058
- Come. We must leave today.
- Joanie!

119
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:24,767
In just four nights I will become Emperor,
and you will have the exclusive story.

120
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:27,675
- They have emperors on the Nile?
- They do now.

121
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:30,638
Oh, shit.

122
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:52,561
So now what are we celebrating?

123
00:11:52,637 --> 00:11:55,105
- The Nile!
- Oh, the Nile.

124
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:57,206
We"ve been invited to Africa.

125
00:11:58,075 --> 00:12:00,202
Jack Colton, Omar Khalifa.

126
00:12:00,978 --> 00:12:03,242
How do you do?

127
00:12:03,314 --> 00:12:09,514
He"s asked me - me - to write his story.
It"s just what I"ve always wanted to do!

128
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,920
And now Joan"s work will receive
the serious attention that it deserves.

129
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,051
And this will be her biggest accomplishment:

130
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:19,221
my biography.

131
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:23,389
What"s so important there
that you have to write the book now?

132
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,992
- Mr Khalifa has...
- Omar, please.

133
00:12:26,604 --> 00:12:30,836
Omar has been chosen
to unite the tribes of the Nile

134
00:12:31,075 --> 00:12:34,010
and end the strife that has bloodied his land.

135
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,241
He will carry on the work of
the missing Great Redeemer.

136
00:12:37,315 --> 00:12:41,217
- You have listened very well.
- You got all that in 20 minutes?

137
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,113
As a friend of Miss Wilder"s,
you are welcome to be my guest also.

138
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:49,751
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

139
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:54,520
Could I talk to you for a minute, please?

140
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:02,330
I thought you wanted to go to New York.

141
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,738
- That"s all changed.
- That fast?

142
00:13:04,842 --> 00:13:09,108
But to write a biography -
it"s something important, something real.

143
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,344
- This is what I"ve been looking for.
- Isn"t it a little bit over your head?

144
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:15,942
I think it"s a great chance.

145
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:18,112
So you got your heart set on it?

146
00:13:22,993 --> 00:13:25,461
Mine"s set on Greece.

147
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:32,060
So when are you gonna leave?

148
00:13:33,204 --> 00:13:35,968
Tonight. He has a private jet and...

149
00:13:36,073 --> 00:13:38,337
Oh, he"s got a private jet.

150
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:43,970
- Oh, what the hell. We had a good run.
- Oh, Jack, come on.

151
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:46,879
This is just five or four weeks of research.

152
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,749
Maybe you"re right. Maybe we need a break.

153
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,220
It"s been kind of tough lately.

154
00:13:52,323 --> 00:13:55,884
Yeah. When the going gets tough,
the tough go to Greece.

155
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:03,128
- Well, I"ll write you.
- Where?

156
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:06,699
Yeah.

157
00:14:06,771 --> 00:14:08,602
Where?

158
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:25,378
I think I"ll go down and
give that roulette wheel one more chance.

159
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,458
You take care of yourself.

160
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,063
And you stay out of trouble.

161
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,681
Look out for her, will ya?

162
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:59,017
I can offer you this comfort:
she leaves you for a higher purpose.

163
00:15:02,293 --> 00:15:04,193
Yeah.

164
00:15:19,443 --> 00:15:21,502
Free Al-Jawhara!

165
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:55,474
Don"t be frightened. You know,
a man of vision has many enemies.

166
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:59,505
And my destiny is to outsmart them.
You see?

167
00:16:00,484 --> 00:16:02,543
Like it?

168
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:05,351
It"s OK.

169
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:50,929
Well, sweetheart, I guess it"s just you and me.

170
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:53,765
Goddamn it, she was the best time I ever had.

171
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:57,004
Don"t cry, scumbag! I"ll keep you company.

172
00:17:00,544 --> 00:17:03,877
Cartagena, Colombia!
Long time no... Oh, shit.

173
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,974
- Go ahead. Gimme a reason. Make my year!
- Hey, go easy with the gun.

174
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:12,715
Did you miss me? I missed you.
You"re all I thought about for six months.

175
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,757
They threw me in ajail filled with rejects
from the communicable disease ward.

176
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:22,761
Every wacko, drippy,
open-sored lowlife was in thatjoint!

177
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,324
All wanting to be my proctologist.

178
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:28,800
And rats! I"m full of rat bites.

179
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:35,001
Ten weeks of rabies shots this long and
all I thought of was you, Colton. Just you!

180
00:17:35,112 --> 00:17:39,640
Well, I"m flattered, pal.
And I"m sorry you had such a tough time.

181
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:43,019
How about 100 bucks?

182
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,022
I"ll give you a one-way ticket to Harp Land!
What"d you do with it?

183
00:17:47,124 --> 00:17:50,389
- What are you talking about?
- The stone, moron! I"m cocked!

184
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:55,262
- Let"s talk about this like gentlemen.
- Gentlemen! Did I tell you I got malaria?

185
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:59,803
Every time I shake, I shake like this. Know
what happens if I shake my trigger finger?

186
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,931
And I feel an attack coming on!
Know what happens if that happens?

187
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,839
It"s the end of Mr Lucky. That"s the end of...

188
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:09,674
Holy shit!

189
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:14,048
Quiet! Next time you"ll not be so lucky.

190
00:18:14,151 --> 00:18:18,087
- I am Tarak. You must come with me now.
- What the hell are you?

191
00:18:18,188 --> 00:18:21,954
- Omar steal ourjewel. Al-Jawhara.
- Jewel?

192
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:26,587
You were invited with the woman. You can
get into Omar"s palace. My people cannot.

193
00:18:26,664 --> 00:18:31,465
- What people? What are you talking about?
- You must help me find the Jewel.

194
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,900
- Whatjewel?
- The Jewel of the Nile.

195
00:18:34,004 --> 00:18:36,495
- Our most priceless jewel.
- Oh, thatjewel.

196
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:40,373
Omar has stolen my people"s jewel.
Omar is a very bad man.

197
00:18:40,444 --> 00:18:42,503
Oh, that scum! I spit on him!

198
00:18:42,613 --> 00:18:46,242
Jack, buddy, let"s help this nice man
get his jewel back.

199
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:49,877
- Yes.
- Look, I don"t know where you"re from,

200
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:52,080
but I"m sailing my boat tonight.

201
00:18:52,189 --> 00:18:56,626
No, you must come to help find the Jewel
now before Omar kill many people.

202
00:18:56,894 --> 00:19:00,694
As long as Omar have the Jewel,
nothing can stop him.

203
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,825
Look, I"m going on the boat.
You guys can do what you want.

204
00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:12,272
The boat blew up!

205
00:19:14,645 --> 00:19:16,510
My boat blew up.

206
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,638
The boat blew up!

207
00:19:18,716 --> 00:19:20,809
Everything"s gone.

208
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,512
Who are you? The Prince of Darkness?
Don"t you got any friends?

209
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,749
This is the work of Omar.

210
00:19:30,227 --> 00:19:34,061
- Omar blew up my boat, huh?
- Your woman is in danger, too.

211
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:36,155
I will take you to him.

212
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:38,734
- I"m coming, too.
- The hell you are!

213
00:19:39,336 --> 00:19:42,328
Look, you owe me, Colton.

214
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:45,101
So wherever you"re going, I"m going.

215
00:19:46,443 --> 00:19:48,707
Where we going?

216
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:50,337
Africa.

217
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:24,142
- Do you recognize my home?
- I wrote this!

218
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:29,514
Yes! In The Return of the King.
I had the same uniforms designed.

219
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,390
Hello. Hi!

220
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:50,837
- Is all this yours?
- It belongs to the country. To my people.

221
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:52,806
Oh.

222
00:20:57,848 --> 00:20:59,975
Why point out the negative?

223
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,110
In three nights in Kadir
the moon will be full,

224
00:21:03,187 --> 00:21:08,716
and all my people will unite behind me
in peace and none of this will be necessary.

225
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:13,229
- Now let me show you my humble house.
- Thank you.

226
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,837
I"m really blessed. My people love me.

227
00:21:21,939 --> 00:21:25,602
Well, yes. They seem very... enthusiastic.

228
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:36,812
Oh, this is a good shot for you -
the little boy holding up my picture.

229
00:21:36,887 --> 00:21:38,980
Oh, yeah, that"s wonderful.

230
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:02,773
My humble house.

231
00:22:02,846 --> 00:22:05,474
You must forgive us. We are a poor people.

232
00:22:15,425 --> 00:22:18,019
Everything you need, they will bring you.

233
00:22:18,095 --> 00:22:19,585
Oh, thank you.

234
00:22:19,663 --> 00:22:23,656
Here only strangers say thank you.
Family and friends have no need.

235
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,627
What was that?

236
00:22:27,704 --> 00:22:29,797
Cats. Come.

237
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:33,804
I have a cat.

238
00:22:41,418 --> 00:22:43,477
I hope this is satisfactory.

239
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:48,287
Oh, yes, this is OK. Fine.

240
00:22:48,425 --> 00:22:50,916
Here you"ll write your masterpiece.

241
00:22:51,028 --> 00:22:53,223
Ah, I have a few questions...

242
00:22:53,297 --> 00:22:56,824
I see the writer is already at work. Good.

243
00:22:57,901 --> 00:23:00,301
Explore your new world.

244
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,828
Feel free to go anywhere and see anything.

245
00:23:04,141 --> 00:23:06,234
Talk to anyone.

246
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:10,574
I"m glad you"re here, Joan.
Together we"ll make history.

247
00:24:08,105 --> 00:24:10,164
It"s like a fishbowl!

248
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,836
Why do these Third World cesspools
always gotta be so hot, will you tell me that?

249
00:24:17,114 --> 00:24:19,173
Hey, where the hell you going?

250
00:24:24,654 --> 00:24:26,747
Holy shit!

251
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,402
Well, Colton, looks like
we"ve hitched our wagon to a star.

252
00:25:17,374 --> 00:25:19,433
Stop that! Stop it!

253
00:25:28,118 --> 00:25:30,211
Excuse me?

254
00:25:31,288 --> 00:25:33,779
What does this mean?

255
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:41,092
- Do you speak English?
- "Give back the Jewel. "

256
00:25:41,698 --> 00:25:45,190
- Give back the jewel?
- Yeah. Eid lana Al-Jawhara.

257
00:25:50,073 --> 00:25:52,541
You can"t do that! I"m a professional.

258
00:26:01,418 --> 00:26:03,477
We"ll see about that.

259
00:26:05,422 --> 00:26:08,823
If you don't tell me
what the hell is going on here,

260
00:26:08,892 --> 00:26:13,090
- I"ll be on the first plane back to New York.
- It"s impossible.

261
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:18,760
Tomorrow we journey to Kadir. You must be
there. It will be your most important chapter.

262
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:22,896
- I can"t write, if you keep secrets from me.
- What secrets?

263
00:26:25,742 --> 00:26:27,835
What is the Jewel?

264
00:26:30,113 --> 00:26:32,445
The Jewel is a legend.

265
00:26:32,516 --> 00:26:34,575
I am real.

266
00:26:35,185 --> 00:26:38,586
Do not be distracted
from your mission, Joan Wilder.

267
00:26:39,322 --> 00:26:41,381
Make yourself comfortable.

268
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:44,927
You stay with me until our book is done.

269
00:26:44,995 --> 00:26:47,088
You can"t keep me here!

270
00:26:49,866 --> 00:26:51,925
Go. You are free to leave.

271
00:26:55,138 --> 00:26:59,268
Only the worst kind of fool
would attempt our desert alone.

272
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:13,886
I gotta get off this camel.
It"s breaking my ass! Colton!

273
00:27:13,957 --> 00:27:16,517
- You gotta hang on and take it.
- I can"t.

274
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:20,085
- The camp"s coming up.
- Shit!

275
00:27:35,378 --> 00:27:37,437
You are welcome!

276
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,709
We have food! We have drink!

277
00:27:41,818 --> 00:27:43,911
You got a toilet?

278
00:27:48,758 --> 00:27:51,056
So how big is this jewel?

279
00:27:56,766 --> 00:27:59,860
Very, very big. Very big. Very, very big.

280
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,130
Very big.

281
00:28:02,272 --> 00:28:05,002
It"s as big as this orange?

282
00:28:12,749 --> 00:28:16,617
- It"s as big as an orange.
- The Jewel is the heart of our people.

283
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:19,220
Omar steals the heart of our people.

284
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:21,587
- Omar is thief.
- Omar is very bad man.

285
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:24,950
Before Omar steal Jewel, everything good.

286
00:28:25,028 --> 00:28:26,962
Now everything is shit!

287
00:28:35,572 --> 00:28:40,305
You help us find the Jewel,
and we give you great reward.

288
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,709
But if you lie to us, you die.

289
00:28:45,482 --> 00:28:47,450
But now we dance!

290
00:29:22,452 --> 00:29:24,511
Look at these guys, Colton.

291
00:29:24,621 --> 00:29:26,680
No sheep is safe tonight.

292
00:29:38,134 --> 00:29:41,968
We split it right down the middle,
Colton. 50-50.

293
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,131
What are you talking about?

294
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,731
Don"t play stupid with me, partner.

295
00:29:46,843 --> 00:29:48,708
The Jewel.

296
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:51,576
And don"t you even think of
messing with me.

297
00:29:57,287 --> 00:30:01,189
Oh, what"s that I hear?
A heart breaking? You sap!

298
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:03,156
Keep your mind on business.

299
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:07,787
You"ll wind up getting yourself killed
over some broad who dumped you.

300
00:30:09,699 --> 00:30:11,360
Jewels!

301
00:30:11,468 --> 00:30:13,766
Oh, Omar!

302
00:30:42,499 --> 00:30:44,990
I want you lot to be careful!

303
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:50,900
See that word "Fragile" on the side?
It means don"t drop... Why don"t you listen?

304
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:55,741
I might love your country, your culture,
and even your people! That means I love you!

305
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:59,612
But you drop one more of my boxes,
and I"ll smash your bloody face in!

306
00:31:02,018 --> 00:31:07,115
You tell Omar, right - Omar -
that his special-effects wizard has arrived!

307
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,249
Come on, then.

308
00:32:35,512 --> 00:32:38,413
War plans? Oh, my God! What is he up to?

309
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,684
Wait till Time magazine sees this.

310
00:33:11,147 --> 00:33:13,672
You bastard! You burnt my hand!

311
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:18,710
I didn"t say it wouldn"t burn.
I said it wouldn"t hurt! There"s no blistering.

312
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:23,316
- I"ve done it hundreds of times on stage.
- This is not a cheap theatrical stunt!

313
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:28,695
- It"s a miracle! My people have to believe it!
- Omar, trust me. Trust what I"ve got to say.

314
00:33:28,765 --> 00:33:33,725
Look, if I can make gods out of rock"n"roll
stars, imagine what I can do for you.

315
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:37,762
For your information,
I am not a rock"n"roll star!

316
00:33:37,874 --> 00:33:41,139
The people must believe
I have the same powers as the Jewel.

317
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,576
Come! I want to see him now.

318
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,878
If it weren"t for the Jewel,
I"d have led my people to power long ago.

319
00:33:57,226 --> 00:34:02,289
Westerners understand nothing. The Jewel
represents the spiritual world of my people.

320
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,960
Unless I convince them I am their spiritual
leader, they will never follow me into battle.

321
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:09,129
That is why you are here.

322
00:34:34,063 --> 00:34:38,193
- Tell me how it"s done, magician.
- It"s not magic trick. It"s miracle.

323
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,867
I am losing patience with you.

324
00:34:41,971 --> 00:34:45,930
But you cannot kill me.
Even you are superstitious.

325
00:34:46,009 --> 00:34:48,671
Al-Jawhara lives.

326
00:34:48,778 --> 00:34:51,838
Two nights from now it will not matter.

327
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:09,454
Oh, no.

328
00:35:13,803 --> 00:35:15,794
A woman?

329
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:19,065
- Most unexpected.
- I gotta get outta here.

330
00:35:19,175 --> 00:35:21,234
I gotta stop Omar.

331
00:35:21,511 --> 00:35:24,275
Did you bring an army?

332
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,612
- No. I"m just Joan Wilder.
- Just-Joan Wilder, I"m Al-Jawhara.

333
00:35:31,387 --> 00:35:33,855
The Jewel of the Nile.

334
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,522
I don"t understand.

335
00:35:36,626 --> 00:35:39,993
- You are the Jewel?!
- Yes. For the moment.

336
00:35:40,063 --> 00:35:45,000
In two nights at the holy city of Kadir
Omar will proclaim himself Emperor.

337
00:35:45,068 --> 00:35:49,095
Without me to oppose him, he"ll march
across North Africa like a madman.

338
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,607
But the world will see me
as the savior of my people.

339
00:35:53,676 --> 00:35:58,545
No, it won"t. The world won"t believe you.
I"ve been in your office and seen your vision.

340
00:35:58,648 --> 00:36:01,014
- I"ll write the truth about you.
- The truth?

341
00:36:01,317 --> 00:36:04,343
If I wanted the truth,
I would have hired 60 Minutes.

342
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:07,514
What do you know about truth?
You fantasize everything.

343
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:13,027
Why do you think I brought you here? You
stay here and write what I tell you to write!

344
00:36:14,664 --> 00:36:18,828
- You think no one knows I"m here?
- Oh, yes, Jack! I forgot to tell you.

345
00:36:19,102 --> 00:36:21,627
Jack is dead.

346
00:36:22,572 --> 00:36:26,372
Don"t be ridiculous.
Jack would never die without telling me.

347
00:36:26,743 --> 00:36:28,836
Nevertheless, he is dead.

348
00:36:35,752 --> 00:36:40,382
You look pale, Miss Wilder.
I"ll send you my personal physician.

349
00:36:46,796 --> 00:36:49,196
It can"t be true.

350
00:36:54,704 --> 00:36:58,333
This Jack... He is friend for you?

351
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:01,605
Yes.

352
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:03,770
He is my best friend.

353
00:37:16,726 --> 00:37:19,194
What? I don"t see shit!

354
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,354
We must stop here.

355
00:37:22,431 --> 00:37:25,491
It is dangerous for Sufis to enter Omar"s city.

356
00:37:26,102 --> 00:37:28,798
Now, wait. He"s already tried to kill me once.

357
00:37:30,973 --> 00:37:33,237
You are guest of Omar.

358
00:37:33,843 --> 00:37:36,971
Find for us the Jewel. Accept your destiny.

359
00:37:38,414 --> 00:37:41,315
Destiny, my ass! Excuse me.

360
00:37:42,451 --> 00:37:45,215
When you hook up with jujubes,
see what happens.

361
00:37:45,321 --> 00:37:48,256
Just take your lead from me, and we"ll be fine.

362
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:54,196
- We gonna walk through the center of town?
- I"m gonna put you up a camel"s ass.

363
00:37:54,263 --> 00:37:55,958
I might like it.

364
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:04,165
- What are you doing?
- In one of my books,

365
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,333
Angelina's Savage Secret,

366
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:11,073
she used her nailfile to cut
the mortar away from the window box.

367
00:38:11,614 --> 00:38:13,775
How long did this take?

368
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,818
Two pages.

369
00:38:15,885 --> 00:38:20,481
But... it"s not the bars
that make the prison. It is the desert.

370
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:24,424
So I"ll travel at night. I don"t care.
I have to stop Omar.

371
00:38:24,493 --> 00:38:27,257
I gotta get out to write the truth about him.

372
00:38:27,363 --> 00:38:29,422
I have to get to Kadir.

373
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:33,435
Wait a minute.
You are the one that has to get to Kadir.

374
00:38:33,502 --> 00:38:36,869
You are the only one that can stop Omar.
You have to go with me!

375
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,907
Maybe you are the one.

376
00:38:44,013 --> 00:38:45,446
I accept.

377
00:38:45,848 --> 00:38:47,907
We are sworn, Just-Joan.

378
00:38:49,986 --> 00:38:53,251
- Right. But it"s just Joan.
- Right. Just-Joan.

379
00:38:53,322 --> 00:38:57,019
- Right. We just have to get out this window.
- Please.

380
00:39:02,265 --> 00:39:05,200
- Magic!
- Dry rot.

381
00:39:07,236 --> 00:39:13,266
I bet you could pick up a swell three-bedroom
town house here for about five or six dollars.

382
00:39:16,245 --> 00:39:18,008
Hi. My name is Colton.

383
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,811
I"ve been invited by your Omar.
I"m here to see Joan Wilder.

384
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,111
Hey, Rachid! How are you?
Good to see you again.

385
00:39:27,223 --> 00:39:29,418
Joan Wilder does not want to see you.

386
00:39:33,696 --> 00:39:36,927
Well, now, Rachid,
I don"t think you understand.

387
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:43,029
We"re here on official business.
This is Mr... Fatush from the US Embassy.

388
00:39:43,105 --> 00:39:47,235
He"s got something very important
to talk to all you guys about.

389
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,947
Look, we don"t want to
create an international incident here.

390
00:39:55,051 --> 00:39:58,145
I mean, after all, she is an American citizen.

391
00:39:58,254 --> 00:40:02,384
If you"ll just let us see her, no paperwork.
Mum"s the word. Everything...

392
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:08,453
Guys, no sweat, OK?
We"ll catch you next time we"re in town.

393
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,897
- Take it easy.
- Say hello to her for us.

394
00:40:10,967 --> 00:40:14,698
You know what they say: once
they"ve had a holy man, they never go back.

395
00:40:15,304 --> 00:40:19,502
- Quickly, Just-Joan!
- Are you sure you know where you"re going?

396
00:40:24,747 --> 00:40:27,773
Those guys can go for hours
without coming up for air.

397
00:40:27,917 --> 00:40:31,978
Ease up, will ya?
All right, there"s gotta be another way in here.

398
00:40:32,088 --> 00:40:37,924
I can"t wait for another smooth move. How
about us at the back door in pussycat suits?

399
00:40:37,994 --> 00:40:41,828
- When they come with the milk...
- How about you takin" it in the ear!?

400
00:40:41,964 --> 00:40:45,161
Look, if it wasn"t for me,
you wouldn"t be on to this.

401
00:40:45,368 --> 00:40:48,303
Subsequently I should shoot you
the first chance I get!

402
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:49,929
Jack!

403
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:52,398
You"re alive!

404
00:40:52,508 --> 00:40:54,635
Kinda going outta your way to duck me!

405
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:57,144
You bastard!

406
00:41:05,721 --> 00:41:08,588
Oh, Jack! I thought I"d never see you again.

407
00:41:08,657 --> 00:41:12,616
They told me you were dead.
I never wanna feel that way again.

408
00:41:13,129 --> 00:41:15,859
Does this mean you apologize?

409
00:41:15,998 --> 00:41:20,162
I feel like I"m back in eighth grade.
Is this The Young and the Stupid?

410
00:41:20,236 --> 00:41:24,605
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Don"t get cagey with me. I"m on to it.

411
00:41:24,673 --> 00:41:26,766
I know how you two operate.

412
00:41:29,211 --> 00:41:32,339
I"ll get in there with or without you dinks!

413
00:41:41,157 --> 00:41:46,220
Hey, look, guys! Lighten up!
I"m only saying hello to an old girlfriend here!

414
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:50,061
- Just-Joan, we need to go!
- Wait a minute, who"s this guy?

415
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:53,465
- He"s a friend.
- You made friends in there?

416
00:42:09,785 --> 00:42:12,720
- OK. Let"s go, come on!
- Wait. He"s coming with us.

417
00:42:13,889 --> 00:42:17,689
Don"t start with me! I"ve come
halfway across Africa to rescue you.

418
00:42:17,793 --> 00:42:20,591
Rescue me? I was doing fine without you.

419
00:42:22,398 --> 00:42:25,697
- I am guide. I can help.
- I don"t need a guide. I need a miracle!

420
00:42:25,801 --> 00:42:27,860
Jack, he"s coming with us.

421
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:35,940
All right. But if we get out of this alive,
I"m gonna kill you.

422
00:42:36,078 --> 00:42:37,511
Let"s go.

423
00:43:12,314 --> 00:43:14,874
- Who are you?
- Is this where Al Jolson"s buried?

424
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:17,714
- Who the hell are you?
- Don"t provoke me, pal!

425
00:43:17,786 --> 00:43:22,382
I had a tough day. You know
how hot it is here? It"s 120º in the shade.

426
00:43:24,527 --> 00:43:27,894
I"m like this with Weinberger.
We"ll be all over you!

427
00:43:35,871 --> 00:43:37,736
Let me in!

428
00:43:39,808 --> 00:43:41,935
Holy shit and shove me in it.

429
00:44:14,343 --> 00:44:16,402
Oh, no. Over the wall!

430
00:44:50,279 --> 00:44:52,645
Excuse me. Excuse me.

431
00:44:56,552 --> 00:44:58,417
Come on!

432
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,148
No! No!

433
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,853
OK, flyboy,
your estimated time of departure is now!

434
00:45:26,615 --> 00:45:29,584
- What are you doing?
- I"m not doing anything!

435
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:34,180
- Well, do something!
- All right. I"m trying!

436
00:45:37,393 --> 00:45:39,725
I mean, this isn"t Space Invaders!

437
00:45:45,834 --> 00:45:48,735
- Jack, the wall!
- Oh, no!

438
00:46:29,144 --> 00:46:33,308
- It is Space Invaders!
- That"ll show "em!

439
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:44,992
All right, yeah!

440
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,491
Oh, shit!

441
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:52,725
Let"s get outta here!

442
00:47:08,417 --> 00:47:10,510
This is gonna be tight!

443
00:47:15,424 --> 00:47:17,688
This is my first time in airplane.

444
00:47:30,339 --> 00:47:32,705
How do you stop this thing?

445
00:47:39,014 --> 00:47:40,914
Sorry!

446
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:51,991
- Do you know where you"re going?
- Give me a break!

447
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:39,705
- Your friend steal the Jewel.
- What?

448
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:47,439
- You! You are liar to me!
- No!

449
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:50,214
I come back and you"re dead!

450
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:58,387
You thieving bastard!
You ain"t stiffin" me again!

451
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:01,861
I promise ya.
I"ll feed ya to the maggots! I"ll get...

452
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,321
Great! We"re out of quarters.

453
00:50:03,392 --> 00:50:05,519
Well, try that one there.

454
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,192
Now what?

455
00:50:13,702 --> 00:50:15,761
Damn it!

456
00:50:25,514 --> 00:50:27,277
Yes!

457
00:50:28,116 --> 00:50:30,778
Hey, that"s not bad for your first time.

458
00:51:05,153 --> 00:51:07,246
Come on, we"ll get him. We"ll get him.

459
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:09,916
Colton, you ain"t gettin" away.

460
00:51:30,846 --> 00:51:32,939
Where the hell"s the horn?

461
00:51:34,182 --> 00:51:36,946
Get outta here! Get out of the way!

462
00:51:55,103 --> 00:51:56,570
Sandstorm.

463
00:52:06,515 --> 00:52:09,109
Stop!

464
00:52:09,484 --> 00:52:11,884
What are you gonna do?

465
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:16,016
Either save us or kill us. Hang on!

466
00:53:17,252 --> 00:53:20,187
- Now you are dead.
- No! Don"t cut off my head!

467
00:53:20,288 --> 00:53:24,315
- You stole ourjewel.
- It was the mook! He"s always screwin" me.

468
00:53:24,392 --> 00:53:27,361
I swear to God on my eyes
I never seen thatjewel!

469
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:31,591
No, wait, wait!

470
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,260
You need me. I can help you find him.

471
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:39,273
- You are his friend.
- No! No friend. Stop saying that.

472
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,673
Friends don"t stab each other in the back.

473
00:53:41,743 --> 00:53:46,373
Come on. Look, we"ll team up.
We"ll find him, we"ll get him good.

474
00:53:46,481 --> 00:53:50,747
He knows that I will not be denied!
Colton"s future is bleak!

475
00:53:51,419 --> 00:53:53,512
Very bleak!

476
00:53:56,491 --> 00:53:58,356
Any idea where we are?

477
00:53:58,426 --> 00:54:03,386
The best I can figure out is that we head
due east. We should make it to the border.

478
00:54:03,498 --> 00:54:09,095
- Well... is that the way to Kadir?
- La. Kadir is in the west, over that mountain.

479
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:12,731
Well, the best of luck to you, pal.
Joan, let"s get going.

480
00:54:12,808 --> 00:54:15,003
Jack, we have to take him to Kadir.

481
00:54:16,311 --> 00:54:19,747
What are you talkin" about?
We got him out, like you said. Come on.

482
00:54:19,815 --> 00:54:22,943
We swore an oath, Just-Joan and I.
We go to Kadir.

483
00:54:24,452 --> 00:54:26,943
What is it with you?!

484
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:31,754
Jesus! Everything"s always gotta be
your way? It"s just like the goddamn boat!

485
00:54:31,827 --> 00:54:36,264
What do you mean "my way?" It wasn"t
my idea to spend six months on your boat!

486
00:54:36,364 --> 00:54:40,801
- Oh, debate good. I enjoy.
- OK, let me tell you what I put up with.

487
00:54:41,203 --> 00:54:45,435
We"re moored off the Canary Islands.
Midnight, sound asleep.

488
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,168
Three crazed Joan Wilder fans

489
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:51,679
decide they want the anchor
of the Angelina for a souvenir!

490
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:57,218
- We were drifting for days! And the other...
- Stop. I"m sorry. It"s time for Just-Joan.

491
00:54:57,285 --> 00:55:00,448
- Remember the Costa del Sol, Jack?
- Oh, come on!

492
00:55:00,555 --> 00:55:03,388
He"s gotta meet me
at the governor"s for dinner.

493
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:08,418
And you show up with the entire
national basketball team!

494
00:55:08,496 --> 00:55:10,396
They were hungry.

495
00:55:10,465 --> 00:55:14,094
This is what I"m talking about.
Sometimes you could think about me.

496
00:55:14,202 --> 00:55:18,434
Oh, I suppose you were thinking all about me
when you took off with Omar?

497
00:55:18,506 --> 00:55:20,599
- He blew up my boat!
- Our boat?

498
00:55:20,675 --> 00:55:24,577
- Oh, now it"s our boat?
- Good debate. It"s equal, no winners.

499
00:55:24,646 --> 00:55:27,911
- Just-Joan, we must hurry.
- Wait. He blew up our boat?

500
00:55:28,016 --> 00:55:31,281
Why are you risking your life for this guy?

501
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:36,455
I made a commitment. I can"t break it.

502
00:55:40,328 --> 00:55:42,990
OK. Fine.

503
00:55:43,064 --> 00:55:46,864
But I"m gonna tell you the truth.
I didn"t come here for you anyway. No!

504
00:55:46,935 --> 00:55:50,029
I"m on to something big.

505
00:55:50,672 --> 00:55:55,666
- Ajewel. The Jewel of the Nile.
- Come with us. I am Jawhara!

506
00:55:56,678 --> 00:55:59,943
- That means Joe.
- Thanks, Joe, but no thanks.

507
00:56:00,448 --> 00:56:03,440
I wouldn"t want her
to break her commitment.

508
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:06,245
Oh, Jack...

509
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,714
Come on.

510
00:56:46,995 --> 00:56:49,088
That"s for the Angelina.

511
00:56:50,265 --> 00:56:52,290
I still owe you for Joan.

512
00:56:55,904 --> 00:57:00,568
Oh, no. Oh, God.
Please, let me get out of this alive.

513
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:04,702
I swear to God
I"ll be a good boy from tomorrow on.

514
00:57:10,185 --> 00:57:12,312
But tonight I gotta kill Colton.

515
00:57:26,101 --> 00:57:28,535
Heydi Joan Wilder!

516
00:57:42,617 --> 00:57:46,383
- Why you didn"t tell your friend about me?
- Oh, I know him.

517
00:57:46,955 --> 00:57:51,415
He"d go halfway round the world for a party.
He wouldn"t cross town for a noble cause.

518
00:57:51,526 --> 00:57:55,462
- People can surprise you.
- No, he"s just Jack. He"ll never change.

519
00:57:55,563 --> 00:57:57,622
Like a...

520
00:57:58,199 --> 00:58:00,360
Like a stone.

521
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:04,166
It"s always a stone. Open your hand.

522
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,671
Change is not always visible.

523
00:58:08,843 --> 00:58:12,006
- Let"s show some hustle!
- What?

524
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:16,039
Your buddy Omar!
What is it? He can"t live without you?

525
00:58:19,888 --> 00:58:22,755
- Are we jogging?
- We are jogging.

526
00:58:35,503 --> 00:58:37,994
Greece is looking better and better.

527
00:58:47,048 --> 00:58:49,107
Oh, shit!

528
00:58:50,618 --> 00:58:53,519
Just tell me why this guy wants you so bad.

529
00:58:54,456 --> 00:58:56,890
- Hey, Joe, where you going?
- This way.

530
00:58:56,991 --> 00:59:00,290
- You gotta be kidding.
- He knows the mountains better than you.

531
00:59:00,428 --> 00:59:02,487
Joan, will you give me a break?

532
00:59:02,597 --> 00:59:04,997
America - democracy. We vote, huh?

533
00:59:59,521 --> 01:00:01,580
Stop!

534
01:00:13,601 --> 01:00:15,694
Hurry up. Let"s go!

535
01:00:16,604 --> 01:00:17,866
Get down!

536
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:24,169
It"s a black day for democracy.

537
01:00:25,613 --> 01:00:29,674
- Do not worry. It"s not my destiny to die here.
- What about us?

538
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:33,410
That"s another ball game.

539
01:00:42,397 --> 01:00:44,627
Rachid!

540
01:00:48,636 --> 01:00:50,831
Joan Wilder!

541
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:53,305
I wish no harm to you!

542
01:00:53,741 --> 01:00:56,301
I"m your friend! Your fan!

543
01:00:56,844 --> 01:00:59,039
Please surrender!

544
01:00:59,147 --> 01:01:03,311
What did you do for this guy Omar
you never did for me?

545
01:01:03,384 --> 01:01:05,443
Bloody bitch!

546
01:01:15,196 --> 01:01:17,255
Oh, shit! Look out!

547
01:01:49,464 --> 01:01:51,659
Hey, Omar! Eat rocks!

548
01:01:53,568 --> 01:01:55,058
Let"s go.

549
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,924
I got something.

550
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:32,199
Nubians.

551
01:02:32,273 --> 01:02:34,605
I was hoping to avoid them.

552
01:02:41,649 --> 01:02:43,742
Sell any books here?

553
01:02:47,088 --> 01:02:50,751
- Main man! Hey, my man!
- What are you so happy about?

554
01:02:50,858 --> 01:02:55,090
Just keep smiling. Maybe they"ll think
we"re from National Geographic.

555
01:03:01,269 --> 01:03:03,328
Hey! How ya doin"?

556
01:03:34,569 --> 01:03:37,697
He says it"s many days"
long trip over high mountains.

557
01:03:37,805 --> 01:03:40,399
And he wishes us a very pleasantjourney.

558
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:44,876
Thank you.

559
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:49,076
All right. Thank you, guys.
Catch you next time. Goodbye.

560
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:51,209
Come on, Jack.

561
01:03:53,955 --> 01:04:00,155
Ah, Mr Jack! Just-Joan! The Chief's son, he
wishes to make a blessing for your marriage.

562
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:04,730
We"re not married.

563
01:04:25,386 --> 01:04:30,653
He says because you are not married,
that his son wishes to court you.

564
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:33,593
- Oh, I just...
- Oh, no, that"s...

565
01:04:34,629 --> 01:04:38,963
That"s very nice, but the lady is...
She"s with me.

566
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:50,440
He says that because there is more than
one suitor, that you must wrestle his son.

567
01:04:50,778 --> 01:04:52,871
I gotta wrestle his son?

568
01:04:57,985 --> 01:05:00,044
How ya doin"?

569
01:05:03,658 --> 01:05:05,751
OK. This one I think I can handle.

570
01:05:06,427 --> 01:05:08,292
OK!

571
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:14,395
No?

572
01:05:15,002 --> 01:05:17,061
Hussein!

573
01:05:37,024 --> 01:05:40,721
Wait a minute, guys.
Let"s talk this over like gentlemen!

574
01:05:43,331 --> 01:05:45,799
All right. You guys are with me, huh?

575
01:05:45,867 --> 01:05:47,835
Yeah, me. All right.

576
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:51,895
Do me a favor. Tell him
we lived together for six months. Shit.

577
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:54,337
All right, what are the rules?

578
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:21,028
Right.

579
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:34,571
I"m sorry about that.

580
01:06:37,351 --> 01:06:39,581
No, not the left one! No!

581
01:06:43,691 --> 01:06:46,558
No pain, no gain.

582
01:06:46,661 --> 01:06:48,720
Let me go!

583
01:06:55,303 --> 01:06:57,362
- No!
- Can we talk about this?

584
01:06:58,339 --> 01:07:00,398
Stop it!

585
01:07:00,908 --> 01:07:02,967
We have to do something!

586
01:07:03,711 --> 01:07:05,770
I am doing something.

587
01:07:26,934 --> 01:07:28,993
Joe, he"s...

588
01:08:32,667 --> 01:08:36,899
- That was great!
- Great, huh? I could"ve gotten killed!

589
01:09:33,494 --> 01:09:38,022
This is the marriage dance. In this tribe,
the women, they choose the man.

590
01:09:38,432 --> 01:09:42,835
And then, according to the custom,
they will be together for life.

591
01:09:42,903 --> 01:09:45,303
They get all that from one dance?

592
01:09:45,372 --> 01:09:47,033
It"s beautiful!

593
01:09:52,513 --> 01:09:57,314
Ralph, if you want to be one of us,
take off your shoes and socks.

594
01:09:58,119 --> 01:10:01,885
If you want to be one of us,
you must see with the eyes of your heart,

595
01:10:01,956 --> 01:10:04,754
- not with the eyes of your head.
- Gotcha, yeah.

596
01:10:04,859 --> 01:10:08,090
Your heart will never give you fear or pain -

597
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:10,255
if you know our way.

598
01:10:12,466 --> 01:10:14,093
Ralph.

599
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:17,535
No, thanks, pal. Keep your friggin" jewel.

600
01:10:17,605 --> 01:10:19,698
- No!
- Are you afraid?

601
01:10:20,608 --> 01:10:22,508
I just had my feet resoled.

602
01:10:22,777 --> 01:10:26,941
- What is the worst that can happen to you?
- I could wind up a Chicken McNugget.

603
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:32,919
- What is the best that could happen to you?
- I could get through this and find the Jewel.

604
01:10:32,987 --> 01:10:35,080
It"s your choice.

605
01:10:35,156 --> 01:10:37,215
Look down.

606
01:10:41,162 --> 01:10:42,823
Hot coals!

607
01:10:46,567 --> 01:10:48,694
I did it! I did it! I"m one of us!

608
01:11:16,197 --> 01:11:18,256
All right! Yeah!

609
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:46,449
Your fears - they make you foolish.

610
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,593
Go to her, Jack.

611
01:13:17,751 --> 01:13:21,710
- I"m sorry I got people shooting at you again.
- You kidding?

612
01:13:21,789 --> 01:13:25,122
We"re the perfect couple
when we got people shooting at us.

613
01:13:25,192 --> 01:13:29,925
- Just the slow times I"m not too good at.
- I guess I just expect too much.

614
01:13:29,997 --> 01:13:32,090
Maybe we both expect too much.

615
01:13:35,302 --> 01:13:37,361
Oh, boy.

616
01:13:39,106 --> 01:13:41,506
Thank you for coming to Kadir with me.

617
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:12,095
This valley is gift of the Nile.

618
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:22,909
I"ve been away from here too long.

619
01:14:27,221 --> 01:14:30,918
You know, I"m getting to like this guy Joe.
He"s growing on me.

620
01:14:30,991 --> 01:14:34,324
What do you say we cut him in
on this jewel, if we ever find it?

621
01:14:34,395 --> 01:14:36,454
Jack...

622
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:39,357
We have the Jewel.

623
01:14:40,367 --> 01:14:42,528
What are you talking about? Where?

624
01:14:43,137 --> 01:14:45,401
Well, there.

625
01:14:49,076 --> 01:14:51,169
- What, Joe"s got the Jewel?
- No.

626
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:54,740
Joe is the Jewel.

627
01:14:58,385 --> 01:15:00,580
Joe is the Jewel of the Nile?

628
01:15:00,654 --> 01:15:04,852
He"s a holy man. That"s his religious title.

629
01:15:06,994 --> 01:15:09,258
Joe is the Jewel.

630
01:15:17,171 --> 01:15:20,971
Why didn"t you tell me the truth?
Why"d you keep it from me?

631
01:15:21,041 --> 01:15:24,169
Because I thought if you knew,
you wouldn"t come with us.

632
01:15:24,244 --> 01:15:26,303
Maybe I would"ve surprised you.

633
01:15:27,214 --> 01:15:31,207
I think I"ve come through once or twice,
if I remember right.

634
01:15:31,285 --> 01:15:34,015
I"m sorry.

635
01:15:34,088 --> 01:15:37,023
You"re right. You come through all the time.

636
01:15:44,598 --> 01:15:46,657
It"s funny.

637
01:15:47,701 --> 01:15:50,226
I really thought we had a chance.

638
01:16:05,285 --> 01:16:07,276
Look! The train to Kadir!

639
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:10,551
Come on, Jack.
Inshallah, we"ll be there tonight.

640
01:16:10,657 --> 01:16:14,855
- What a lot of people!
- They are going to see the false redeemer.

641
01:16:14,928 --> 01:16:18,261
- Omar again, huh?
- We"ll see about that.

642
01:16:54,201 --> 01:16:56,294
Shit!

643
01:18:06,206 --> 01:18:08,265
What are you doing?

644
01:18:08,742 --> 01:18:11,040
Come on!

645
01:18:11,278 --> 01:18:12,939
Jump!

646
01:18:16,617 --> 01:18:18,050
No!

647
01:18:48,882 --> 01:18:50,975
No! Hang on, Joan!

648
01:19:09,803 --> 01:19:11,464
Jack, watch out!

649
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:13,529
It"s...

650
01:19:41,968 --> 01:19:45,768
Guys, wait up! Come on, Humphrey.
Go, go, go!

651
01:19:55,248 --> 01:19:57,443
Do something!

652
01:19:57,517 --> 01:19:59,576
What do you want me to do?

653
01:21:32,379 --> 01:21:34,040
Colton!

654
01:21:35,649 --> 01:21:39,016
Your ass is grass,
and I"m a lawn mower, Colton!

655
01:21:39,085 --> 01:21:41,952
Colton, I"ll get you! Colton, I"m on to ya!

656
01:22:15,422 --> 01:22:17,049
Colton.

657
01:23:12,546 --> 01:23:14,639
All right, yeah!

658
01:23:17,083 --> 01:23:20,314
All right! Let"s go, come on.
Let"s get out of here!

659
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,253
Just-Joan, you"re gre...

660
01:23:31,097 --> 01:23:32,962
Welcome.

661
01:23:33,066 --> 01:23:38,163
I don"t usually travel by train,
but I had a small accident with my helicopter.

662
01:23:51,518 --> 01:23:53,782
May we reach Kadir in time.

663
01:24:16,643 --> 01:24:20,704
Once we get inside,
we must find the entrance to the catacombs.

664
01:24:21,581 --> 01:24:23,640
T- shirts! Buy T-shirts!

665
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:28,187
Gimme the T-shirt.
I"ll buy it, I"ll buy it. Get outta here, will ya?

666
01:24:48,441 --> 01:24:52,343
You know, I really admire
your loyalty to each other.

667
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:56,982
And I"m going to give you a chance
to be together to the very end.

668
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,950
Well, not exactly.

669
01:24:59,019 --> 01:25:02,147
One will watch the other die.

670
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:09,353
But which one?

671
01:25:11,031 --> 01:25:13,090
Rachid.

672
01:25:14,834 --> 01:25:18,065
- Is that the goat"s blood?
- Yes.

673
01:25:18,171 --> 01:25:22,232
Very popular
with the inhabitants of these catacombs.

674
01:25:22,709 --> 01:25:26,975
- Rats.
- Yes. They eat until they get the last drop.

675
01:25:27,313 --> 01:25:30,373
But don"t worry, Mr Colton.
You won"t be alone.

676
01:25:31,184 --> 01:25:36,281
Rachid is now placing acid
that will eat through Miss Wilder"s rope.

677
01:25:36,389 --> 01:25:39,290
What kind of sick pervert
would go to this trouble?

678
01:25:39,793 --> 01:25:41,784
- Why don"t you shoot us?!
- Jack!

679
01:25:41,861 --> 01:25:45,797
What kind of demented psychopath
would even think of this?

680
01:25:45,999 --> 01:25:48,467
- The Savage Secret.
- What?

681
01:25:49,669 --> 01:25:51,500
Was my biggest seller.

682
01:25:55,809 --> 01:26:00,405
Think about this pit
as your last adventure, Joan Wilder.

683
01:26:01,881 --> 01:26:04,145
My people await me.

684
01:26:24,337 --> 01:26:27,898
What you talkin" about?
I work with professional people.

685
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:31,967
You tell His Highness
the show starts with him or without him.

686
01:26:39,719 --> 01:26:43,883
Goddamn beanie convention.
Wind up goin" home with a rug.

687
01:26:43,957 --> 01:26:46,050
The entrance!

688
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,468
Give me a red to the yellow. And cue!

689
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:03,901
I said give me a red gel down there!

690
01:27:09,783 --> 01:27:12,809
And cue! For Gawd"s sake, cue!

691
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:40,402
Build it, build it softly.
And give me some smoke.

692
01:28:10,810 --> 01:28:15,213
That"s good, that"s good, that"s very good.
Now, bring it up slowly.

693
01:29:32,425 --> 01:29:34,859
There are many rooms and many ways.

694
01:29:34,961 --> 01:29:37,156
You! You go this way.

695
01:29:37,263 --> 01:29:39,527
And, you! You go this way.

696
01:29:39,632 --> 01:29:42,100
And we: we go this way.

697
01:30:03,156 --> 01:30:05,249
Boy, it stinks in this place.

698
01:30:09,562 --> 01:30:12,190
What looks good, amigo?

699
01:30:12,298 --> 01:30:16,166
You go from this way. And... I go this way.

700
01:30:16,269 --> 01:30:18,328
All right.

701
01:30:19,339 --> 01:30:21,204
What a fruit loop.

702
01:30:22,742 --> 01:30:24,801
- How"d they get out?
- What?

703
01:30:24,911 --> 01:30:27,880
In The Savage Secret, how"d they get out?

704
01:30:29,716 --> 01:30:32,583
Jesse had a knife hidden in his boot.

705
01:30:33,886 --> 01:30:36,878
You wouldn"t happen to have a knife,
would ya?

706
01:30:36,956 --> 01:30:40,016
- I"m not even wearing underwear.
- Great!

707
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:43,219
No!

708
01:31:02,448 --> 01:31:05,178
We were good together,
weren"t we, Joan Wilder?

709
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:07,412
The best.

710
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,421
- And we"re gonna make it.
- Yeah.

711
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,194
Oh, God. I love you, lady.

712
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:18,196
I love you, Jack.

713
01:31:18,531 --> 01:31:20,590
Will you marry me?

714
01:31:21,868 --> 01:31:25,201
- Yes!
- Because I never want you leaving me again.

715
01:31:25,872 --> 01:31:29,865
You"re notjust saying that
because this is it, are you?

716
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:35,638
I"m saying it
because I"m not afraid to say it anymore.

717
01:31:49,896 --> 01:31:53,229
So where do you wanna go
on our honeymoon?

718
01:32:14,687 --> 01:32:18,851
Rats! Get out of here, you...
Goddamn rat farm! Go on!

719
01:32:19,258 --> 01:32:24,924
- Ralph! Get us out of here, will ya?
- Ah! And there"s the biggest rat of all.

720
01:32:25,865 --> 01:32:27,924
Colton, look at you. You...

721
01:32:28,901 --> 01:32:31,529
You don"t know how many nights
I dreamed of this.

722
01:32:31,637 --> 01:32:37,041
- Except your flesh was torn off your body.
- Ralph, please, just help us down.

723
01:32:37,110 --> 01:32:39,237
Jack! Hold on!

724
01:32:40,513 --> 01:32:43,277
Well, well, well, Colton.

725
01:32:43,349 --> 01:32:47,809
I think this calls for a renegotiation.
Don"t you, Tarzan? Huh?

726
01:32:47,887 --> 01:32:51,118
This looks a little bit more like 70-30.

727
01:32:51,257 --> 01:32:55,717
- Or maybe even 80-20.
- Ralph, will ya get the rats off that rope?!

728
01:32:56,362 --> 01:33:00,662
- I don"t go near rats, buddy.
- Ralph, do not be afraid.

729
01:33:02,101 --> 01:33:04,831
Remember the Sufi way: see with your heart.

730
01:33:05,471 --> 01:33:09,271
My heart sees rats, Pop.
Don"t let this garb fool you.

731
01:33:09,342 --> 01:33:11,572
Come on, Colton. Where"s the Jewel?

732
01:33:11,677 --> 01:33:15,977
Ralph, I am the Jewel. The Jewel of the Nile.

733
01:33:16,082 --> 01:33:19,245
And I"m a kumquat from Queens.
Pipe down, towel-head!

734
01:33:19,318 --> 01:33:22,481
- Come on, Ralph.
- Take the ladder and put it over the well.

735
01:33:22,555 --> 01:33:26,252
- Please, don"t let us die!
- That"s a good idea, Legs.

736
01:33:26,325 --> 01:33:31,729
I ain"t gonna let you die, but I ain"t movin" no
ladder until you come across with the rock!

737
01:33:45,511 --> 01:33:48,002
Lookin" more like 90-10! Huh, kumquat?

738
01:33:49,916 --> 01:33:53,750
- Did you get the ladder all right?
- Jack, help me unlock the Jewel.

739
01:33:53,819 --> 01:33:58,552
The Jewel? You mean you weren"t
shittin" me? That guy really is the Jewel?

740
01:33:58,624 --> 01:34:01,752
Come on.
We still got time to stop Omar. Let"s go.

741
01:34:02,895 --> 01:34:05,830
Ralph, that is not the Sufi way.

742
01:34:05,932 --> 01:34:11,131
I don"t know what got into me, Jewels. Every
time I"m around this guy he makes me crazy.

743
01:34:11,204 --> 01:34:15,436
Come on. Tell him to cut me down, Jewels.
Come on, huh?

744
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:04,283
Don"t fuck around with the equipment!
Bloody woman!

745
01:35:28,447 --> 01:35:30,506
Here they come, Jack.

746
01:35:52,238 --> 01:35:57,403
Oh, my God. Look at this. Looks like
Our Lady of Mount Palmer schoolyard.

747
01:35:58,911 --> 01:36:00,845
Hold it!

748
01:36:05,117 --> 01:36:07,847
Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through.

749
01:36:09,488 --> 01:36:11,115
Oh, Rachid.

750
01:36:11,223 --> 01:36:15,250
How ya doin"? Let"s talk this over
before you butcher me alive.

751
01:36:15,328 --> 01:36:17,853
What are you getting so steamed about?

752
01:36:20,666 --> 01:36:23,157
Look at that. It worked!

753
01:38:03,536 --> 01:38:05,731
Get over the wall. Come on!

754
01:38:06,071 --> 01:38:08,164
Get goin".

755
01:38:13,145 --> 01:38:15,204
Keep going.

756
01:38:41,006 --> 01:38:44,442
I knew we"d hook up again, Colton. Get it?

757
01:38:47,213 --> 01:38:49,306
I swear to God!

758
01:38:49,415 --> 01:38:51,474
My right hand to God!

759
01:38:51,584 --> 01:38:53,677
Come on!

760
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:39,827
I am dead, Miss Wilder.
All that will be written for Omar is an epitaph.

761
01:39:40,165 --> 01:39:42,258
But I will not be alone.

762
01:39:51,944 --> 01:39:54,469
Who is going to save you now?

763
01:39:57,149 --> 01:39:58,582
Who?

764
01:40:39,725 --> 01:40:41,818
Well, you got your story.

765
01:40:42,761 --> 01:40:44,888
I got a lot more than that.

766
01:41:08,988 --> 01:41:10,751
You are married!

767
01:41:40,653 --> 01:41:43,383
Always a bridesmaid, never the bride.

768
01:41:43,455 --> 01:41:45,980
