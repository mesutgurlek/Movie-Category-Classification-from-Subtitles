1
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,360
Hey Rahul! Want to be
friends?

2
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,440
She's just like her
father. lsn't she?

3
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,440
Tina's very critical Rahul.

4
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,040
She doesn't have much time.

5
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,760
We tried our best.

6
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,360
She had severe internal bleeding.
We couldn't do anything.

7
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,160
She knew there would be
complications in her delivery.

8
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,680
She also knew how much you
wanted this child.

9
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,320
She loved this baby more
than her life.

10
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,680
l want my daughter to now me.

11
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,320
Who her mother was,
what she was like.

12
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,400
l want her to be able to answer
all these questions herself.

13
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,760
l am leaving these 8 letters
for her...

14
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,080
...1 each of her 1st
8 birthdays.

15
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,360
These letters have everything
that l want to tell my daughter.

16
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,040
These letters are going
to be her memories.

17
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,800
You are very bad.

18
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,360
You are very bad.

19
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,760
Rahul, Want to be friends?

20
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,680
Promise me you will never cry.

21
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,120
Anyways, you look very bad
when you cry.

22
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,920
Also promise me that...

23
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,880
...you'll name our daughter
Anjali.

24
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,240
l am sorry Rahul.
l am really sorry.

25
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,760
Don't go.

26
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,840
Promise me you'll name
our daughter Anjali.

27
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,320
Hi! l am Anjali...

28
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,680
...and you're watching
channel Anjali.

29
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,040
l am going to grow up
and be a V.J...

30
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,960
...you know just like
Neelam.

31
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,760
Hey cut cut cut.

32
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,240
Ooops l'll be back
after the break.

33
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,440
My hobbies are eating
chocolates,...

34
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,960
...beating up boys,
irritating granny...

35
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,960
...and reading mom's letters.

36
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,280
Hey l'm late.

37
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,920
l have to get ready and
go to meet papa.

38
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,280
l'll be back next week
same time, same place.

39
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,720
Watch me.

40
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,040
Hi, Anjali, listen to me.
Look.

41
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,960
Look... l'm only...

42
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,320
...2 hours late.

43
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,560
Right.
- Okay. Sorry. l was busy.

44
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,160
So was l.

45
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,680
l haven't even watched
television today...

46
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,120
...because l had to come
to do your shopping.

47
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,360
l can't handle everything.
l'm your daughter not your wife.

48
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,200
Why?

49
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,400
lf l can be both your dad
and mom...

50
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,080
...why can't you be both...
Okay.

51
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,280
What?
- Felt bad?

52
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,760
A bit.

53
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,280
Sorry
- Okay.

54
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,240
That is why one says...

55
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,400
...there is only one god
in many forms.

56
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,920
No matter what form,
he knows our devotion.

57
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,320
lt is important to keep
this bond with god.

58
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,240
She speaks so well, doesn't she?

59
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,120
So, that's all for today.

60
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,800
Now we'll have...

61
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,560
l got this gift for
St. Valentine's day.

62
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,480
Rupa!
- Me?

63
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,120
Rupa will chant the
divine hymn.

64
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,400
Me?

65
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,920
Chant Rupa.

66
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,760
The divine hymn...
l forgot it.

67
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,320
What?
What are you saying Rupa?!

68
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,840
Can you believe that sisters?
She has forgotten the divine hymn.

69
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,680
My dear if you don't pay
attention to prayer...

70
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,560
...what will you teach
your children.

71
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,600
The way we think and
the things we say...

72
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,200
...have a deep impact
on our children.

73
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,600
Granny.

74
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,720
Speaking of children...
Namaste. - Hi, sexy!

75
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,360
Who taught you that?
- Papa.

76
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,040
Go get ready for your
School function.

77
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,000
Granny... the letter.

78
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,240
When is your birthday?
- Tomorrow.

79
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,440
So?

80
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,960
Come on, hurry up.

81
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,400
Yes, there are our seats.
- Come sit.

82
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,320
Come Mr. Khanna, sit.

83
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,200
Good evening ladies
and gentlemen.

84
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,320
Welcome to the
Just one-minute competition.

85
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,600
lt's a strange competition. Children
have to talk on the stage...

86
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,160
.. and the topic is given right
there in some strange bowl.

87
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,040
On the spot sir, on the spot.

88
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,360
Stop it Balbir, control yourself.
- Never mind. lt's ok.

89
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,000
Every student will be given only
one minute. Just one minute.

90
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,520
Just One Minute?
Only one minute to speak?

91
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,200
Exactly. Very unfair.

92
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,200
But yet our Jassu wins
every year.

93
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,040
She's so talented you know.

94
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,160
Best of luck Jaswinder.
- Same to you.

95
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,360
Our Jaswinder is the best.

96
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,320
Actually Anjali is also
taking part.

97
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,320
She'll come second.
Don't worry.

98
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,600
Thank you.
- Oh welcome!

99
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,400
Our first contestant is
Jaswinder Singh.

100
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,960
Oh! My sweetheart.

101
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,760
My topic is Prayer.

102
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,840
Every morning we pray
to the lord.

103
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,320
Papa says prayers will
keep god happy...

104
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,240
...and he will protect us.

105
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,960
Mummy says that by praying
Grandma will get impressed...

106
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,640
...and will leave the big
house for us in the will.

107
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,680
Prayer... yes, my favourite
actress's name is Puja...

108
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,480
...and even my best friend's
name is Puja.

109
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,360
Wow! My daughter is
the best.

110
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,280
Next we have Anjali Khanna.

111
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,800
Pick your topic.

112
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,760
Second!

113
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,360
Your timer starts now.

114
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,400
Say!

115
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,040
Mother!

116
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,440
Mother!

117
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,800
Mother!

118
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,920
l am sorry.

119
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,760
Mother...

120
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,760
A mother is someone
who loves us so much,...

121
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,080
...that we sometimes can't
understand it.

122
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,680
A mother is someone who makes
us realise how good we are,...

123
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,200
...there is no one better
than us.

124
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,280
Her happiness is in our
laughter...

125
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,800
...and sorrow in our
sorrow.

126
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,040
She is someone we can't
live without,...

127
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,920
...she is everything.

128
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,040
Only we don't have her.

129
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:48,240
But we have papa, and
he is quite nice too.

130
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,440
Then you give me a hug.

131
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,880
That's number one!

132
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,320
Rahul, you remember
Mr. Shama? He had phoned.

133
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,680
Who?

134
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,760
Our neighbour in Delhi.
He has sent a proposal.

135
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,120
For whom?

136
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,240
Me.
Shut up.

137
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,040
He said the girl is
sweet and beautiful...

138
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,960
...but l refused flatly.

139
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,440
l did the right thing, didn't l?
- Yes.

140
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,080
l did the right thing?
- Yes.

141
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,880
l was right?

142
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,520
Yes mom.

143
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,400
Well l must have done
the right thing.

144
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,840
l never do anything wrong.

145
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,520
So what if the girl is
sweet and beautiful.

146
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,240
Everyone is beautiful these days.

147
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,000
Who wants to get married?
Mr. Sharma has gone mad.

148
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,800
Keeps sending me proposals.

149
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,400
Why doesn't he get himself married
and just leave me alone.

150
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,920
What's wrong mom?

151
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,040
l just find this family
incomplete.

152
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,200
Why? You are there.
l am there...

153
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,000
...Anjali is there, l don't
find it incomplete.

154
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,800
When l go out with my
friends,...

155
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,120
...they all complain about
their daughters-in-law.

156
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,200
l can't even do that.

157
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,480
This is a big problem.

158
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,600
So you need a daughter-in-law
to complain about.

159
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,240
No son.
l just want you to be happy.

160
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,760
l am happy mom.

161
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,600
So you won't marry again?

162
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,200
Mom, we live once, die once,
get married once,..

163
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,680
...and love once.

164
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,800
We don't do these again.

165
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,320
You are fine, but what
of Anjali.

166
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,360
Why? What's happened to her?

167
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,760
You don't feel she needs
a mother?

168
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,480
She's okay.

169
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,120
She's just fine.

170
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,640
She's got something which
even l don't have.

171
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,760
Her mother's letters.

172
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,120
Happy Birthday Anjali.

173
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,280
My dear, Anjali.
Happy Birthday Anjali.

174
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,520
You are 8 years old today.

175
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,560
l'm sure you look just
like your dad.

176
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,800
That same smile, those
same eyes.

177
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,960
No. l look like you.

178
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,040
Does your father still go
Old habits die-hard.

179
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,760
Today you are a big girl and
you will be able to understand...

180
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,520
...what l have to tell you.

181
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,880
Today, l will tell you a story...

182
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,160
...about your father, me and
Anjali.

183
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,080
Anjali?

184
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,000
You're late again.

185
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,160
Can't wake up so early.

186
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,280
Can't wake up or were
you scared.

187
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,120
Rahul Khanna is never
scared.

188
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,400
But loses to Anjali Sharma
everyday in Basketball.

189
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,000
Don't want to play?

190
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,920
What's the point, you
will lose again.

191
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,760
l won't lose today.
- You say that everyday.

192
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,280
We'll see.

193
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,440
We'll see.

194
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,440
lf you can't play
atleast don't cheat.

195
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,800
Don't call me a cheater.

196
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,720
Anjali, don't call me
a cheater.

197
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,280
Rahul is a cheater.

198
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,400
He is a cheater, cheater.

199
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,320
l am not a cheater.
- Cheater.

200
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,120
Stop screaming like a girl.
- Hey! Don't call me a girl.

201
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,240
You're right, you're not a girl.

202
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,240
Atleast better than those
girls you run after.

203
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,640
Excuse me! l don't run after
them, they run after me.

204
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,200
Wow! Rahul's so cute.
- Yes.

205
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,840
He's so sweet, he's so
handsome.

206
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,040
Not as handsome as you,
you have a better moustache.

207
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,320
Was that a joke?
- What if it was?

208
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,400
l don't like jokes.
- l don't like you.

209
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,480
Shut up.

210
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,480
Rahul and Anjali have
fought again.

211
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,880
Rahul and Anjali have
fought again.

212
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,680
Rahul and Anjali
have fought.

213
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,760
Rahul and Anjali
have fought again.

214
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,440
''What sort of a boy is this?''

215
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,920
''What sort of a girl is this?''

216
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,200
''What do l do with him?''

217
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,680
''What do l say to her?''

218
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,400
''He fights with me!''

219
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,040
''She irritates me!''

220
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,240
''He troubles me''

221
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,680
''She gets upset''

222
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,800
''He is crazy''

223
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,160
''She is crazy''

224
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,120
''But he is your best friend dear''

225
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,000
''But she is your best friend dear''

226
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,080
''Oh my! Oh my! this boy.
Oh my! Oh my!''

227
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,840
''Why does he play these pranks?
Ask him please, why''

228
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,760
''Sometime he fights with me,
sometime he quarrels with me''

229
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,280
''Stay away from him''

230
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,320
''This boy is crazy''

231
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,000
''Crazy... Crazy...''

232
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,960
''Oh my! Oh my! this girl

233
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,760
''Why does she play these pranks?
Ask her please, why''

234
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,240
''Sometimes she fights with me''

235
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,840
''Sometimes she irritates''

236
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,360
''Trouble her, but only
from a distance''

237
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,200
''This girl is crazy.
Crazy... Crazy...''

238
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,480
''Only she understands
what she says''

239
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,720
''No one else can
figure that out''

240
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,960
''She's like this
and she's like that''

241
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,760
''No one can figure her out''

242
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:18,120
''So run for your life,
she is surely upto some mischief''

243
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,920
''This girl is crazy.
Crazy... Crazy...''

244
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,800
''This boy is crazy.
Crazy... Crazy...''

245
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,760
''He teases us
as he comes by''

246
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,600
''He does not listen''

247
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,320
''Look, look, he is crazy
beware of him''

248
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:33,320
''He is weird and yet
he is dear to me''

249
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,560
''This boy is crazy.
Crazy... Crazy...''

250
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,640
''This girl is crazy.
Crazy... Crazy...''.

251
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,680
Oh God! Just look at
this room. Filthy.

252
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,440
These girls will drive
me crazy.

253
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,960
Hey! What is this mountain
on your head?

254
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,080
These are rollers, Rifat bi.

255
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,800
Rollers don't impress boys.
You can take that from me.

256
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,560
Then how do they get impressed,
Rifat bi.

257
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,200
Oh god! What are you wearing?

258
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,760
Come on tell us.
- l don't know.

259
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,640
Tell us please.
- No!

260
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,880
Tell us.

261
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,080
Okay! Boys get impressed by
a girl's mannerisms,...

262
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,680
...her walk, her talk...
- And?

263
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,120
And l don't know.

264
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,840
You girls talk to much.
Come on, clean up this mess.

265
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,760
God! What do l do with
this girl, Anjali, what is this?

266
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,000
What are you wearing?

267
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,720
lt's cool Rifat bi.

268
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,320
Cool? Try to be feminine once
in a while atleast.

269
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,080
Not like them but...

270
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,400
Rifat bi, you say the
same thing everyday.

271
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,920
You know, l beat Rahul
in basketball again.

272
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,040
Stay away from that boy.

273
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,200
Why? He is my best friend.
He is my buddy.

274
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,200
When best friend becomes
boy friend,...

275
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,960
...one doesn't even get to know.
- Rahul? Please.

276
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,280
Yes, yes. l know all about that.

277
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,080
Here l've got you some pudding.
Don't tell anyone.

278
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,160
Oh! Thank you Rifat bi.
- Leave me, mad girl.

279
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,480
No short skirts in the
college please.

280
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,280
Good morning Ms. Briganza.

281
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,120
Good morning boys,
Nice colour Piyush.

282
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,680
l'll complain to your
parents that...

283
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,200
...you wear short skirts to
college in order to excite the boys.

284
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,960
Excuse me!

285
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,920
l said no short skirts
in college please.

286
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,720
Oh! Ms. Briganza.

287
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,960
You said something Malhotra?

288
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,560
Oh! l was just saying, that short
skirts are not allowed in college.

289
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,920
What? But this is the
latest fashion...

290
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,360
...infact, some girls don't
even wear skirts these days.

291
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,600
Don't tell me Ms. Briganza.
- Yes!

292
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,360
And am l not looking
nice today?

293
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,720
You're very queet. Queet?

294
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,480
Cute.

295
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,760
You're very cute.

296
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,840
But if you expose like this,
then these youngsters...

297
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,080
What do you mean by these youngsters.
Am l not young?

298
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,640
You're... young. Very young.

299
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,600
But you wear very boring
clothes.

300
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:20,600
l Know. Till Mrs. Malhotra
was alive...

301
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,400
...l would occasionally wear
fancy clothes.

302
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,600
Really?

303
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,360
But now there is no point.
- What do you mean?

304
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:39,040
Mr. Malhotra... Ms. Briganza...
Mrs. Malhotra.

305
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,000
Happy friendship day.

306
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,320
Sharma. Always scaring me.

307
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,120
What are you doing now.
- lt's a friendship band sir.

308
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,800
Besides being your student,
l am also your friend now.

309
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,320
Oh! Good!

310
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,800
Sir, you look very happy today.

311
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,760
What do you mean?
- Just generally.

312
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,360
Oh! Generally. Well, my daughter
is coming home today.

313
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,600
Your daughter?
- Tina.

314
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,600
- She is coming back from London.
- From London?

315
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,640
She was studying at
Oxford University.

316
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,560
Oxford University?

317
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,240
We used to all live there.

318
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,280
But when Mrs. Malhotra died,
l couldn't stay there anymore.

319
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,960
- So l came back to my country.
- Tina didn't come back with you?

320
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,040
No. She had to finish
her education.

321
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,600
But l miss her, so l told her
to complete her final year,...

322
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,400
...in our college, after all
we are no less than Oxford.

323
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,720
Yes Sir!

324
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,880
You'll take care of Tina, won't you?
- Of course sir.

325
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,320
Happy friendship day.
- Thank you sir.

326
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,760
Who? Rahul?

327
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,680
Yes! l'm the first girl for whom
Rahul has tied a friendship band.

328
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,560
lsn't it exciting.
- Of course.

329
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,200
You know l am tying a friendship
band only for you.

330
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,520
Really Rahul?
- Really Sonia.

331
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,120
That is because you're the
nicest...

332
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,800
...and most beautiful girl
l've known.

333
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,640
Really Rahul?
- Really Sonia.

334
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,120
Oh Rahul! You are telling
the truth, aren't you?

335
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,360
Really Tanya.
- My name's Sonia.

336
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,440
See! l got so lost in
your eyes, l forgot your name.

337
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,000
l just can't believe this Rahul.
- Trust me.

338
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,840
Oh Rahul!
- Oh Sonia!

339
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,120
Oh Rahul!

340
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,880
These fell off.
- You cheat, you liar.

341
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,640
Hey come on... Tanya...
What's your name?

342
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,800
Sonia.
- Go away! Wasted my half-hour.

343
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,680
You don't get tired running
after these stupid girls.

344
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,200
Hey! l don't run after...

345
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,880
l know. Can't you find one girl
with beauty and brains?

346
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,880
Beauty and brains?

347
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,280
Where will l find
such a girl?

348
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,040
l'm only passing my time with these
girls. l haven't found her as yet.

349
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,520
Her?

350
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,000
Her.

351
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,120
l'm looking for a girl who
makes something happen.

352
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,800
Makes what happen?

353
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,800
Makes something happen
in my heart.

354
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,640
Makes what happen?

355
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,280
Something happens.

356
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,800
You won't understand.

357
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,480
When she walks, the
world looks on.

358
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,160
And when she stops, time stops.

359
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,160
And when she smiles...

360
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,120
She, she, she. What will you
do when you find her?

361
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,640
What will l do?
- Yes.

362
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,040
l'll kneel down in front of
her, spread my arms and say...

363
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,880
...Hey! Whoever you are...
l love you.

364
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,320
l love you.
- Sorry?

365
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,440
Don't be. l love you.

366
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,880
Excuse me.

367
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,280
Tina!

368
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,320
Tina.

369
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,040
Hi! l'm Anjali and you are...

370
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,800
Rahul.

371
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,200
Tina! Right?
- How do you know?

372
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,720
This morning the principal...

373
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,920
Ya! ya! Don't take that old slob's
name first thing in the morning.

374
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,000
So Tina! Your first day in
college?

375
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,680
Yes. She just got back from London.
- How do you know?

376
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,440
Rahul, this morning the
principal...

377
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,560
l just told you not to talk
about that baldy.

378
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,480
Baldy!
- So Tina...

379
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,960
- Where were you studying in London?
- Oxford University.

380
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,080
Ox... How do you know?

381
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,680
Rahul, this morning the
principal...

382
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,600
Yeah! yeah! Let the
Baldy be.

383
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,360
We have this grouch of
a Principal. She's his fan.

384
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,040
Grouch?
- Grouch is right. But forget him.

385
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,520
Tell me how is your
first day in college?

386
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,720
Great.

387
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,280
Good morning Archana.

388
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,880
Feroze... cut your hair.

389
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,680
Short skirt... Oh god.

390
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,880
There's groucho.
Morning Sir.

391
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,240
Short skirts are not allowed
in college, you know that?

392
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,160
You know l just got back
from London...

393
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,560
...and haven't had the time
to unpack.

394
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,360
Sir, it's Tina's first day here,
she's just gotten back...

395
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,280
...from London and hasn't had
the time to unpack.

396
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,440
- She wore whatever she could find.
- And how do you know that?

397
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,080
Sir, l've known Tina
since childhood.

398
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,680
Since childhood? Really?

399
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,800
Really Papa.
- Really Pa... Papa?

400
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,760
Mr. Malhotra l need you here.

401
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,080
Not there sir, in the
staff room.

402
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,000
He's an old slob, a baldy,
and a g...

403
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,080
Great? Good?

404
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,280
Grouch. But he's not
all that bad.

405
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,680
Happy friendship day.

406
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,760
We've only just met,
friendship is a far thought.

407
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,080
So... something happened?

408
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,760
No, she's not my sort.
- Why?

409
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,280
She's not lndian enough.
She's born and brought up in England.

410
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,440
And these London returns
are little weird.

411
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,040
A girl should be one you can
take home to your mother.

412
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,040
No. She's not my type.

413
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,480
She's not my type.
You won't find anyone this way.

414
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,600
Why? You're there.

415
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,480
Me? Just shut up.

416
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,160
lf l don't find anyone else,
l'll marry you.

417
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,320
See. Anyway no one will
marry you.

418
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,920
Here, this is for you.
What's this?

419
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,880
This is our college sweatshirt.
Cool?

420
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,280
Thanks.
Anjali... May l ask you something?

421
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,560
Sure.

422
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,000
Why is everyone staring at me?

423
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,600
Why the boys are staring,
you know!

424
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,440
And the girls are wondering
what the boys are staring at...

425
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,600
...and that is why even they
are staring at you.

426
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,200
And look if you have any
problems,...

427
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,120
...just come to me or
to Rahul.

428
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,680
Rahul? The one who yesterday...

429
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,600
Yeah! He's my best friend and
we sort of rule this college.

430
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,800
This is Rahul.

431
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,560
We have a rule in this college.

432
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,480
We make every newcomer sing.
You know Do Re Me...

433
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,680
Rahul, she's the principal's
daughter.

434
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,320
So! We can't break our rules
for anyone. Right?

435
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,640
But Rahul?
- Shut up,

436
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,400
You have to sing a song for us,
for this college, in Hindi.

437
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,600
Hindi?

438
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Why you forgot how to speak
Hindi in London, is it?

439
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,920
Sorry! One minute.

440
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,680
Rahul how can she sing
a Hindi song?

441
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,720
Why? She's the principal's
daughter.

442
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,520
lf he can't teach her
then how will he teach us,...

443
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,560
...and you shut up.

444
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,040
So, Tina, you will sing
a song in Hindi...

445
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:53,920
...and fast because we don't
have much time. Right?

446
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,240
Living in London and studying
and growing up there...

447
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,160
...has not made me forget
my roots...

448
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,040
...and you don't forget that.

449
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,320
Hey! You're sitting in my place.
- Oh! l'm sorry.

450
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,280
No it's okay. Hey Adi move.

451
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,720
Good morning class.

452
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,600
Good morning Ms. Briganza.

453
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:09,200
Today we are going to start
a new lesson - Romeo & Juliet.

454
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,680
An eternal love story.

455
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,320
Before we begin, l want to
ask you all -...

456
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,320
...What is Love?

457
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,960
Tina? You tell us,
What is love?

458
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,280
Me? l don't know.

459
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,320
You tell us, what is love?

460
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,560
Love?

461
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,080
Anyone?

462
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,120
Rahul... What is love?

463
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,240
Love is friendship.

464
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,160
lf she can't be my best friend,
l can't be in love with her.

465
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,280
Without friendship there is no love.

466
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,640
Love is friendship.

467
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,320
Thank you for sharing
that with us Rahul.

468
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,840
Love is friendship.

469
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:48,240
So! Want to be friends?

470
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,440
Oh my head! My feet.

471
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,840
Oh Sorry Mr. Malhotra,
Ms. Briganza here.

472
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,800
l hope l didn't disturb you...

473
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,240
...and even if l did
l'm sure you don't mind.

474
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,920
Of course not Ms. Briganza.

475
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,000
l called to tell you that
the rehearsals are complete...

476
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,640
...and our college will
come first tomorrow.

477
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,040
Rest of the teams don't stand
a chance. You know what l mean.

478
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,080
This is all because of
you Ms. Briganza.

479
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,800
And it's all for you Malhotra.

480
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,200
Really Ms. Briganza?

481
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,280
Really Malhotra.

482
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,520
Oh Ms. Briganza.

483
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,480
Oh! l have fallen.

484
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,240
And the next college is
our college... St. Xavier's.

485
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,880
What! Oh my god.
They can't make it?

486
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,240
Ms. Briganza, there is a
curfew in their area...

487
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,280
...and they can't leave.
Now what do we do?

488
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:48,520
Mr. Malhotra let me think
please. ldea...

489
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,680
ldea.

490
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,240
You have to do this or else
you both are going to fail.

491
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,320
Bur Sir, how can we sing and dance.
We don't know anything.

492
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,840
You know these students,
they will skin us alive.

493
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,120
Of course it's a good idea.
Nothing will happen to you.

494
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,880
The students who were
going to perform today...

495
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,200
...have recorded a tape of
their rehearsals.

496
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:17,040
l'll play that tape and
you just have to move your lips.

497
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,400
Like in the films. Okay.

498
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,640
lt won't work.

499
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,400
What do you mean it won't
work. Of course it will work.

500
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,840
My name is Chin Chin Chu.

501
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,960
Moonlit sky, you and me,
Hello Mr. how do you do?

502
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:49,360
Anjali, you don't have any concern
for the reputation of your college?

503
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,240
Come on Rahul, it is for
the college.

504
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,400
Come on, help us Tina.
- No, l'm not coming.

505
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,040
What are you saying?

506
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,520
Why are you asking her?
Let's go.

507
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,640
What do l play?
This must be it.

508
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,280
'' You are a foreigner,
You are a foreigner,

509
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,920
You won't be here with us
for long...''.

510
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,520
Looks like, l have put the
wrong tape.

511
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,840
Joe music off.
Lights off.

512
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,160
''l found someone''

513
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,560
''l found someone''

514
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,360
''l found someone?''

515
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,840
''What's come over me?''

516
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,240
''Why do l feel so lost?''

517
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:54,960
''Either l was insane earlier
Or l've just become so.''

518
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:01,960
''Dreamy eyes and unkempt hair,
What have you done to yourself.''

519
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,040
''l found someone...''

520
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,400
''l've lost my heart...''

521
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,960
''What can l tell you my friends...''

522
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,840
''l am all shook up...''

523
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,680
''l've found someone...''

524
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,240
''l don't know
what's happened to me?''

525
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,440
''People have begun
calling me Romeo.''

526
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:11,240
''And why is that so?,
We should also know.''

527
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,840
''What's happened to you?''

528
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,680
''Till yesterday l was
quite fine.''

529
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,040
''My heart was filled with
happiness divine.''

530
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,720
''Then why are you upset?
What are you disturbed about?''

531
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,800
''Have you lost something?''

532
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,680
''l have found someone...''

533
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,320
''Who is this disguised
as a cloud?''

534
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,560
''Who has come and taken
over my heart?''

535
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:42,040
''l would like to say it
but l can't name it.''

536
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,880
''Don't name it but say
something.''

537
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,280
''Give us a slight clue.''

538
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,880
''lt's in my eyes
lt's in my heart''

539
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,760
''What can l tell you friends...''

540
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,680

00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,680
''l don't know what's happened to me''

542
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,880
''Why am l so lost''

543
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,840
''Either l was insane earlier
or l've become so now''

544
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,680
''Dreamy eyes and unkempt hair''

545
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,760
''What have you done
to yourself''

546
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,840
''l've found someone...''

547
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,200
''l've lost my heart...''

548
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,560
''What can l tell you my friends...''

549
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,040
''l'm all shook up...''

00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,920
''l've found someone...''.

551
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,360
Anjali, what's wrong?

552
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,680
Don't know why, l am
missing mom today.

553
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,120
How can you say this when
l am here for you?

554
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,360
Stupid, tears don't
solve anything.

555
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,360
Anjali how long have
you known Rahul?

556
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,360
From the first day at college.

557
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,600
You know what l did?
l defeated him in arm wrestling.

558
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,600
Eversince we've been
best friends.

559
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,160
Rahul is your best friend,
isn't it?

560
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,080
l am Rahul's best friend.

561
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,920
Aren't you in love with him?

562
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,560
Hi! Shall l go?
- Where?

563
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,640
Today's Tuesday...

564
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,840
Rahul goes to meet his
relatives every Tuesday.

565
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,200
But l'll stay if you want.

566
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,160
No, you go Rahul. You'll get late.
- l have some time.

567
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:43,240
No Rahul you'll be late,
go, go, bye!

568
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,360
God please see that l don't fail
in my exams this time as well

569
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,560
l am a bit weak in Chemistry.
So, you take care of it.

570
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,960
Hey! Look forward.

571
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,840
So, your relatives
stay here?

572
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,920
Yes, here... here... here...

573
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,040
So, Rahul Khanna comes
to the temple every Tuesday.

574
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:45,200
Yes.
- How sweet.

575
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,440
Why did you lie at college then?

576
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,800
Actually boys don't go to
the temple. So!

577
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,960
But you do...
- Yes.

578
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,960
You come every week?
- Yes.

579
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,360
How sweet...
- Don't call me sweet.

580
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,680
Actually my dad used
to say that...

581
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,680
...don't tell this to
anyone at college.

582
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,520
He says that a Man should
bow to 3 women...

583
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:09,520
...to mom-to one's mother,
to the Goddess Durga... and...

584
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,960
And?
- And...

585
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,400
Wear it. What do they say,
cool, you'll look cool.

586
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,480
l was just trying. Don't
know, how they wear all this.

587
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:38,000
There's nothing wrong in looking
girlish once in a while.

588
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,680
Here, your mother's letter.
You were missing her, weren't you?

589
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:45,280
And listen, take this too.
- What is this?

590
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,640
Present.

591
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,720
Hey Tina.

592
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,000
Rahul... what are you doing
here at this hour?

593
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,680
Actually l couldn't sleep and l
thought even you won't be asleep...

594
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,200
...and would be thinking of
me, so l came...

595
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:14,040
Do you like flowers or chocolates?
- What?

596
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,280
l haven't got either,
l was just curious...

597
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,040
Got chocolates too...

598
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,200
...don't you think
it's too hot out here?

599
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,920
Okay! lf you insist.

600
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,920
Hey sit down... feel at home.

601
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,480
lsn't this the novel where the
butler murders the married couple?

602
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,600
Why are you wasting your time
reading such a thick book, ask me!

603
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,720
Rahul, you didn't finish
your story.

604
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,240
This couple goes on a holiday and
leave their butler behind...

605
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,240
Later one finds out the
butler is...

606
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,040
Not this story...
- Then?

607
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,800
The one you were telling me
at the temple.

608
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,080
Which temple? l don't know
any temple.

609
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:22,960
The story about a man bowing to
three women,...

610
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,800
...one's mother, the goddess
Durga, and...

611
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,720
- And?
- And...

612
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:34,960
Papa?
- Groucho...

613
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,800
Shut up. Rahul, papa's coming...

614
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,840
Congratulations.
- Shut up Rahul, go from here.

615
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:42,160
No... not from there,
go from there.

616
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:01,840
Rahul!

617
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,120
And.

618
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,160
l'll climb this ladder
and catch the culprit.

619
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,080
What is it?
- Torch.

620
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,800
Throw it.
- Okay.

621
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:35,920
Groucho...

622
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,480
Who hit me?

623
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,440
A ghost! l'll become a ghost as well.
The ghost will also get scared of me.

624
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,280
Where has the ladder gone?

625
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,160
Malhotra!

626
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,000
Why are you sneaking into
your own house?

627
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,960
Rahul, what are you doing?
- l was on my way to see you.

628
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,160
Me? Why?

629
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,320
Hey look, a shooting star.

630
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,240
Where?
- Not down here, up there!

631
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,680
They say if you make a wish on a
shooting star, your wish comes true.

632
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,160
You believe that?
- Let's try. Come on.

633
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,360
''You came close to me''

634
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,320
''Smiled ever so sweetly.''

635
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:51,280
''You gave me dreams.''

636
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:06,400
''These days my heart is neither
awake nor asleep''

637
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:11,280
''What should l do?
Somethings happen in my heart.''

638
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,160
''Oh! What a feeling this is!''

639
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:11,280
''What is this unquenchable thirst?''

640
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:18,920
''l know not, this drunken stupor
of love that's consuming me?''

641
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:24,400
''No one knows, why one loses
one's peace, when in love''

642
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:29,200
''What should l do?
Somethings happen in my heart.''

643
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:14,080
''My prayers have been answered''

644
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:18,600
''God knows when and how
l fell in love.''

645
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:26,600
''l wonder how,
l found peace in turmoil.''

646
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:31,880
''l sit alone, weaving memories.''

647
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:36,920
''What should l do?
Somethings happen in my heart...''.

648
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,440
Butler's the killer...
Butler's the killer...

649
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,640
Hey! Look at that.

650
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,600
Hi guys! How do l look?

651
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,600
Just like Tina, right?

652
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,520
Here? Okay.

653
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,200
l'm mad, aren't l?

654
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,120
l wanted to look beautiful
like you,...

655
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,240
...but l don't even know
how to.

656
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,680
You are beautiful, Anjali.

657
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:10,960
You're lying.

658
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,680
Didn't you hear them
laughing?

659
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,680
Those people are...
-...idiots like me.

660
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,320
Actually you're the most beautiful,
because you're very special.

661
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,400
Atleast you're not like those
girls, l keep running after.

662
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:30,160
You know, you can have
any boy you want.

663
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,280
Anyone?
- Anyone.

664
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,640
Anyone?
- Anyone.

665
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,560
But he has to be cockeyed.

666
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,640
Where did you get this
lipstick?

667
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,360
From that girl 'Babli' in
our class.

668
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,160
l'll bash her nicely.

669
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:14,320
Love is strange,
love is weird.

670
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:21,040
lt's unaware of happiness
and pain.

671
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,320
Papa.

672
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,680
Rahul.
- Papa?

673
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,080
What papa?

674
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,720
You can't keep secrets from me.

675
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,560
But Rahul? Couldn't
you find anyone else?

676
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,280
Come on papa.

677
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:38,080
Actually, l would have felt
as bad,...

678
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,640
...even if it were someone else.

679
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,320
Why?

680
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:45,040
Because l'll have to share
your love with him.

681
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,040
l love you papa.

682
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,680
That is the problem.
l love you too.

683
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:58,200
Have you told him as yet?

684
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,920
l just feel that Rahul
and Anjali...

685
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:15,760
Tina, Rahul only loves you...

686
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:20,000
...and Anjali is his best
friend, nothing else.

687
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,080
No papa.

688
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:27,160
Somewhere hidden in this
deep friendship is deep love...

689
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:32,560
...and l don't want to come
in the way of this love.

690
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,960
The whole college knows that...

691
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,600
...Rahul and Anjali are just
friends and nothing else.

692
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:43,400
Go tell him that you love him.

693
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:48,040
But l don't even know,
if he loves me.

694
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:52,800
Don't keep matters of the heart
a secret. Go and tell him.

695
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:12,880
l love you.

696
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,040
l really love you.

697
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,880
l never thought l'd say
this to someone,...

698
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:28,080
...but l really love you.

699
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,400
l hope l can get myself
to say this to her...

700
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,160
l wanted to say it to her
so often...

701
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,680
...but couldn't get the
courage...

702
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,240
...and whenever l meet her
l decide to, but... somehow...

703
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,440
Tell whom?
- Tina. who else?

704
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,640
Let's do this again.
l'll be Rahul you be Tina.

705
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,600
l love you.

706
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,680
l love you too.

707
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,880
She'll say the same thing,
won't she?

708
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,680
Ya.
- Come here.

709
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:34,480
Shall l tell her?

710
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,800
Shall l go right now?

711
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:55,120
''O! my Lord, love comes with
so much pain.''

712
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:19,120
''The heart felt remains in
the heart...''

713
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:29,680
''...and does not escape
from one's lips.''

714
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:05,520
My first love is incomplete Rifat bi.
My first love is incomplete.

715
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,120
l love you.

716
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:29,200
''You did not remember me,
there's nothing more left to say.''

717
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:44,880
''The heart cried and the eyes welled up
There's nothing more left to say'.'

718
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:50,000
''You did not remember me
there's nothing more left to say''

719
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:05,680
''The heart cried and the eyes welled up
There's nothing more left to say.''

720
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,520
Mother!

721
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:35,440
''l gave you all my joys,
gave you all my smiles.''

722
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:46,960
''Your locks enticed me, bidding
messages of faithfulness.''

723
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:56,080
''You couldn't care for my love.
There is nothing more left to say.''

724
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:01,360
''You did not remember me
there's nothing more left to say.''

725
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,360
Anjali... Anjali.

726
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,600
Rahul you look ahead,
l'll look there.

727
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,880
Anjali... Anjali...

728
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,240
One minute.

729
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,000
Where are you off to?

730
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,720
Home.
- What?

731
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:35,560
l got a letter from mom.
My father's not well...

732
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,680
...and there is lots of work
in the new house.

733
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,760
Have you gone mad? You got
a letter and you're leaving?

734
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,960
You're not going anywhere.
- Rahul, l have to go.

735
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,400
How can you go in the middle
of the term?

736
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,720
Rahul please...
- Go after this semester.

737
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:50,720
Rahul l have to go.
- You can go after the final exams.

738
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,120
Rahul l might not come back
even for the final exams.

739
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,240
l'm not coming back Rahul.

740
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:07,600
You are leaving college,
leaving me...

741
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,760
...and you didn't even tell
me about it.

742
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,600
Rahul please...
- l don't want to know.

743
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,040
Rahul l'm going.
- So go.

744
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,000
Rahul l'm not coming back.
- l don't care.

745
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,880
Anjali don't go.
Who'll l play basketball with?

746
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,920
You used to lose everyday, anyways.

747
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,720
But why are you going?

748
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:34,600
My parents need me...
- And l don't?

749
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:38,160
Now you irritate Tina. You've
bothered me enough.

750
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,720
l'll fail.
- Then fail.

751
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:41,960
Anjali...

752
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,320
Stop chasing those stupid
girls now.

753
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:56,080
l'll miss you Anjali.
- l'll miss you too.

754
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,360
That day l realised that
perhaps...

755
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,680
...l had come between
Rahul and Anjali.

756
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,880
Perhaps, l had come between
two friends...

757
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:45,040
Anjali's silence told me
everything.

758
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:49,240
And that day l was sure...
that she loved your father.

759
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,600
Perhaps even l couldn't
love him as much.

760
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,760
Anjali neither called nor wrote.

761
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:00,400
She had gone away from
our lives. Forever.

762
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,240
You father used to say -
'Love is friendship'.

763
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:10,000
Yes. l became his friend but
could never be his best friend.

764
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:16,720
Your father is alone now
but won't say anything.

765
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:21,360
He needs a friend, he needs
love...

766
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:24,400
that friend is Anjali,
that love is Anjali.

767
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:29,200
Get Anjali back into
your father's life.

768
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:33,360
Return Anjali her first love.

769
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,880
Anjali and Rahul are made
for each other.

770
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:41,000
This is the truth and
this is my dream.

771
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:52,240
Will you fulfil your mother's dream?

772
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,440
Get Anjali back in Rahul's life.

773
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,920
Get Anjali back in your
father's life.

774
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,640
Make my dream come true.

775
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,600
Happy Birthday!
Give me five.

776
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,800
This is Malhotra speaking,
using STD on my personal line.

777
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:01,880
Are you all coming tomorrow?

778
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:06,120
Yes! As soon as we reach Delhi,
we'll take the Faridabad train.

779
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:10,360
The one at 4 O'clock?
- Yes! What are you doing?

780
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:14,520
Me? l was just... nothing.

781
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:16,280
No... sorry not you.

782
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,000
These Mumbai butlers
are something else.

783
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:21,560
Okay then, l'll pick you
up tomorrow.

784
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,920
Sure? You forgot last time.

785
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,520
Last time... this time
l'll be there

786
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,880
...by the way, the requirements
for the death anniversary...

787
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,920
Yes! l am getting it all
with me. Don't worry.

788
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:34,680
Okay then, bye.
- Bye.

789
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:42,200
Hi Guys!

790
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,720
This is Neelam and you're watching
your favourite show, The Neelam Show.

791
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:48,000
Like always we are going to
do something new...

792
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,880
We are going to play a game.

793
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,440
Would you all like to play
this game?

794
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:58,520
lt is said that this game gets
matters of the heart to the fore.

795
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:02,280
l will say a word...

796
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:06,000
...and you have to say the first
word that comes to your mind.

797
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,600
But you get no time
to think.

798
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:14,080
We'll start with you, Clouds?

799
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,960
Sorry. Times up. Clouds?

800
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:18,240
Rain.

801
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,280
Beautiful?
- Neelam.

802
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,520
Thanks!

803
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,440
Heart?
- Love.

804
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:27,520
Okay... Love?
-Seema.

805
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,560
What? You love me?
- Yeah!

806
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,120
This game really works.

807
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:37,480
You saw how real feelings came
rushing out. Now you try this game...

808
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,800
...and we'll be back
after a break.

809
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:46,080
Stupid game, stupid Neelam.
- Don't call my Neelam stupid.

810
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:51,480
Okay! Let's play your game.

811
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:57,240
Okay! Ready, start, go... Sexy?
- Granny.

812
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,280
Papa play seriously.
- Okay.

813
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:01,480
Clouds?

814
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,920
Papa you can't take so long.

815
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:07,960
l'm having water. Okay, now
we'll start. Tell me.

816
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:09,560
Clouds?
- Air.

817
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:10,840
Mad?
- You.

818
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,120
Home?
- Us.

819
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:13,480
Love?
- Friendship.

820
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,320
Anjali?
- Sharma.

821
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:16,840
Sharma?

822
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:21,240
Who is Anjali Sharma?

823
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:24,760
Who is she?

824
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,400
Nobody.

825
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:28,440
Papa, it's my birthday...

826
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:32,120
Okay. Anjali Sharma studied
in college with me.

827
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:34,840
ln your College?

828
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,520
She was my friend.
- Friend!

829
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:41,920
My best friend.

830
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,280
Her name's very nice,
what was she like?

831
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:51,040
She was unlike any other girl.

832
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:56,000
She was like one of the boys.

833
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,160
All the other girls spent
time on make up...

834
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,960
...but Anjali played
Basketball.

835
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:13,800
She wore clothes like me.
Yeah! really.

836
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:23,280
Anjali was mad. Dressing
up and looking beautiful...

837
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:25,600
...was just not her scene.

838
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,560
Enough or do you still
want to hear more?

839
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:35,520
Papa where is she now?
- l don't know.

840
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,880
Anjali, l can't believe that
you are getting engaged.

841
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:51,480
By the way, Guruji has come
to fix the wedding date.

842
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,640
Show me that one.

843
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,960
How much will you adorn yourself,
Aman's getting impatient.

844
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:01,480
Tell him to wait, this
bride will take sometime.

845
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,720
''Your groom has been
waiting for long''

846
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:15,360
''Don't delay anymore
come soon''

847
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:39,240
''l've come to your doorstep
l've come to take you away''

848
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:44,120
''l've come to exchange
my heart for yours''

849
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:58,200
''My every heartbeat has a message
for you... listen to my heart''

850
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:03,000
''The Bridegroom has come home...''

851
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,240
''Why's the bride shy?...''

852
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,480
''The Bridegroom has come home''

853
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:21,720
''Oh! dear heart you can't make
excuses... no more''

854
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:26,360
''Now the bride will have
to go with her groom''

855
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:31,320
''What's her vermilion
whispering to her?''

856
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:20,120
''l've got hooked in
his net of love''

857
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:22,520
''Dear friends, how
did this happen?''

858
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,400
''Tell me, tell me''

859
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:29,440
''Oh my darling! Your friends
too have a crush on me''

860
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,800
''They won't have much to say
Ask them''

861
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:38,520
''Go, go, dear liar
Why do you make self praises''

862
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:48,360
''Your love has something to say
Will you listen to my heart!''

863
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,560
''He is innocent and oblivious. l've
done him a favour by accepting him''

864
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,880
''Someone please convey to him''

865
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:51,040
''She teases me deliberately l've given
my heart in return of her favour''

866
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,680
''Do convey to her''

867
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:58,200
''You're not aware of heartbreak''

868
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:08,040
''Your love has something to say
Will you listen to his heart''

869
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:49,880
''With henna on your hands
bedecked with jewellery''

870
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:59,800
''Teary eyed you will make us all,
and leave in the morning''

871
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:04,320
''We will miss you lots,
We will miss you lots''

872
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:51,120
''l've come to your doorstep
l've come to take you away''

873
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:55,800
''l've come to exchange
my heart for yours''

874
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:00,800
''My every heartbeat has a message
for you... listen to my heart''

875
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:03,040
''The Bridegroom has come home''

876
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:07,800
''Why's the bride shy?...''.

877
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:57,320
This is the old address.
Where do l get the new one from?

878
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,480
What Grandpa, you can't even
do this much for me?

879
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:02,160
l can do it for you but...
- Really!

880
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,200
The college principal can't even
do this much.

881
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:14,360
One minute... She would definitely
know where Anjali Sharma is.

882
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:27,000
l'm sorry. l had promised
Anjali that...

883
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,240
...l would not give her
address to anyone.

884
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,360
We were hopeful that...

885
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:35,480
l understand sir, but l made
a promise to Anjali.

886
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:41,080
Rifat bi, l'm also Anjali,
you won't tell me either?

887
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:48,240
Sir, she's getting engaged
today...

888
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:50,560
...and her wedding is within
this week.

889
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:54,000
Her Guruji will finalise
the date today.

890
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:56,080
The preparations for the
wedding are under way.

891
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:57,960
You have come very late.

892
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:02,080
l am also going by
tomorrow afternoon's train.

893
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:05,880
This marriage cannot happen.
Mummy said so.

894
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:12,600
Guruji, we need to finalise
the wedding date.

895
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,000
Yes dear.

896
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,760
This is Aman's horoscope.
- Yes.

897
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:21,240
Aman wants to go to
London this month.

898
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,480
lf you could find a date this
month itself?

899
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,000
This month?
- Yes Guruji.

900
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,880
Sir, if you would have
come earlier...

901
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:32,160
Yes, but we didn't know...

902
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,720
Anjali's stars have a negative
influence right now.

903
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:01,840
Until it changes she
cannot get married.

904
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:11,400
What about next month Guruji?
- Not even next month.

905
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,840
Not before December.

906
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:48,880
l had heard of God's grace,
today l've seen it.

907
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,800
The child's prayers
have been answered.

908
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,360
Anjali's wedding is
postponed to December.

909
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:03,960
Anjali, can l ask you something?
- Yes.

910
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,640
Are you happy?

911
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:15,800
What sort of a question is that?
Of course l'm happy.

912
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,960
l've got engaged.

913
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:25,680
Aman's really nice, he
loves me a lot and...

914
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:27,280
But do you love him?

915
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:33,920
Anjali...

916
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:41,880
l have already loved mom.

917
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,680
l'm not sure l can do
it again.

918
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,000
Just think of this
as a compromise.

919
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:56,240
Compromise?

920
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:04,160
l never thought that my daughter would
marry out of compromise and not love

921
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:11,360
l'm your mother and l want
you to be happy too.

922
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:19,320
But a home based on a compromise
is a house, not a home.

923
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:26,520
The rest is upto you.

924
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:10,720
Oh! l can't handle this
religious stuff... Yes l can.

925
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:15,240
Today Guruji is going to chant
hymns and read the sacred book.

926
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:18,360
Wow! How exciting. This
Guruji will get a...

927
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:21,280
Why? He has delayed my wedding.

928
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:24,840
l can't stand these hymns any more.

929
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:27,240
Even God gets fed up with
so many hymns.

930
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,520
Why? Don't you want to ask
God for anything special?

931
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:31,640
l've got you...
what more could l ask for?

932
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:37,720
Well l do want some kids but that
l'm afraid l'll have to do myself.

933
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:38,880
Behave yourself!

934
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:48,400
Aman l saw you bare bodied,
exercising this morning.

935
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:52,800
What are you saying?
- Kammo... even in your old age?

936
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:55,560
Old!... old must be you.

937
01:43:56,240 --> 01:44:01,920
Don't trouble him.
Do you have a brother?

938
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:05,400
My Gurpreet is also very pretty.
- What are you saying?

939
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:11,000
Forget Gurpreet,
My Jaspreet is Ms. Chandigarh.

940
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:15,040
Ms. Chandigarh or Ms. Sector 11.

941
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:19,560

Anjali, there is a call for you.

944
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:31,160
Thanks a lot mother-in-law.

946
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:45,240
Huh... Aman!
- Listen, l have a problem.

947
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:49,320
What?
- Don't leave me like this.

948
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,480
Aman l don't know who is
on the line.

949
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:54,840
And anyway you are going to
Shimla for your summer camp.

950
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,960
You're going to Bombay as well.

951
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:00,400
For 24 hours and you're
going for a month.

952
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:04,760
Aman, l go there every year
to teach singing and dancing.

953
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:07,640
Those kids are part of my life.

954
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:10,720
Even they are a part of
your life.

955
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:13,000
Only l'm left out.

956
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:20,120
Why do l get the feeling, you
don't love me?

957
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:22,240
Because l don't.

958
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:26,040
And that you don't want to marry me.
- Right, l don't.

959
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:30,480
Hey! Any tantrums this time...

960
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,800
...and l'll drag you by the
hand to the marriage pandal.

961
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:36,600
You'll force me?
- lf need be.

962
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,280
You have the guts to do it?

963
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:42,880
Try me.

964
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:47,000
l'll stay here with
your aunts.

965
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:49,360
You go to Shimla
for your Summer Camp.

966
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:50,720
Summer Camp!

967
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:53,920
Shimla!

968
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:56,400
Summer Camp? Shimla?

969
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:01,200
No way. Too much snow there.

970
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:05,560
Papa, it's a summer camp.
- Whatever... ls this okay?

971
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:08,680
Yes. Papa they teach singing
and dancing there...

972
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,560
...and you know l am fond
of that.

973
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:13,640
Since when have you been fond
of singing and dancing?

974
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,800
l've said no means no.

975
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:19,640
Papa not fair.
- Let her go.

976
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:23,640
All kids go to camps. She'll also...
- Mom! l'll handle this okay.

977
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:28,080
But Rahul try and understand.
l'll also go with her...

978
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:30,760
Papa l want to go, l want
to go, please papa.

979
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:32,120
No Anjali.

980
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:41,600
Shut up. l said no. Now
neither of you will go.

981
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:06,360
You felt bad? l'm sorry.

982
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:10,520
lt's okay.

983
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:15,320
This doesn't mean you're going.

984
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:19,720
l'm going to the conference.
We'll talk when l get back.

985
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,480
Papa.
- Now what?

986
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:24,760
You haven't worn your pants.

987
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:31,800
lt's okay, you wear it
if you want to.

988
01:47:48,160 --> 01:47:50,080
Driver take out the pant... the car.

989
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:58,240
Anjali... How will we make
your father come to the camp?

990
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:06,200
Oh Granny! Remember when dad was
in London and l fell sick.

991
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:07,520
Yes my baby.

992
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:10,920
Granny. Papa left everything
and came back immediately.

993
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:27,480
Oops sorry!

994
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:33,720

997
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:43,800
lndian Exporters Conference,
good evening!

998
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:46,120
Hello! Can l speak to papa?
- Papa?

999
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:49,200
Your father's not a film star.
Tell her his name.

1000
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:52,440
Sorry. May l speak to
Mr. Rahul Khanna please?

1001
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:54,560
Whom shall l say is calling?
- Anjali.

1002
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:56,320
Certainly, Anjali.

1003
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,440
Quickly tell him we're going
and put the phone down.

1004
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:08,440
Hi! Rahul Khanna.

1005
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:25,080
Hello! Aman, l can't hear you.
- l can hear you. Tell me?

1006
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:29,200
Hi sweetheart!
l'm really missing you.

1007
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:34,720
Listen, l'm off to the camp tomorrow.

1008
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:36,960
Where to?
- Summer camp.

1009
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:40,480
Again summer camp. l said
no once to you, didn't l?

1010
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:45,720
Listen. l'm feeling very...
give me a kiss.

1011
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:49,880
This is your mother speaking.
- Look. l don't like these jokes.

1012
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:51,800
My mother passed away
10 years ago.

1013
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,560
Why is everyone trying to
pronounce me dead today?

1014
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,280
No summer camp, no summer
camp. Understood?

1015
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:58,960
Aman why are you screaming?

1016
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:01,960
That's because l've told you,
you're not going.

1017
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:05,960
lf you say one more thing,
l'll get home and... slap you.

1018
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:07,960
Aman you've gone mad.

1019
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:11,880
Anjali?

1020
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:14,080
Your dad's gone mad.

1021
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:19,160
Anjali?
- Anjali?

1022
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,280
Hi! l'm Rahul Khanna.
- Aman Mehra, how're you doing?

1023
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:30,360
l guess because of the same
name she got confused...

1024
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:34,200
Bet you, my Anjali is
prettier than yours.

1025
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:37,800
No! My Anjali is very beautiful.

1026
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:40,600
l'm sure but not as
beautiful as mine.

1027
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:43,000
My Anjali is my 8-year-old daughter.

1028
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:47,000
Shit! You're right.
Your Anjali is prettier.

1029
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:56,280
Dear Papa, How are you? Sorry
we left without informing you...

1030
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,600
...but you know how much l love
singing and dancing.

1031
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:06,680
Don't miss me too much.
Love Anjali.

1032
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,560
That's not possible for me to do...

1033
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:14,160
Good Morning kids.

1034
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:19,560
l am Col. Almeida, the camp manager.

1035
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,040
l'll now measure your height
and weight.

1036
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:28,760
24 - very nice, 30 - very good.

1037
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:33,360
80 - very... what child is this?

1038
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:36,920
Hey! Who are you?

1039
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:39,880
Me? l am Granny.
- Whose Granny?

1040
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:42,360
Anjali's. Who are you?

1041
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,280
Col. Almeida. Camp Manager.

1042
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:50,040
No grannies', mummies' and
daddies' allowed on this camp.

1043
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,760
So l should've let Anjali
come here alone?

1044
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:55,000
What?

1045
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:57,760
Have you seen Ms. Anjali?

1046
01:51:58,200 --> 01:51:59,120
Ms. Anjali!

1047
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:02,160
What?... What?

1048
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:15,440
The British flag in lndia...?
l'll sort him out. Almeida...

1049
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:24,040
You have no shame?
You've hoisted the British flag.

1050
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:27,040
l love England.

1051
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:30,760
My father was an English tailor.

1052
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:32,840
He made this flag.

1053
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,800
Britishers went away and
left you behind.

1054
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:40,920
You fool, you should teach
the kids ''My Bharat is the best''.

1055
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,760
Here you go.
- Thank you.

1056
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:32,960
Hey! What's your name?

1057
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:39,480
Sorry. What's your name?
- Anjali.

1058
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:41,400
Hey that's my name too. Hi!

1059
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:44,520
Why is your name Anjali?

1060
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:50,080
Perhaps my parents liked
the name.

1061
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:55,120
Why is your name Anjali?
- Perhaps my parents liked you.

1062
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,480
Where is this Almeida?

1063
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:13,200
Namaste.

1064
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:24,160
Almeida...

1065
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:31,360
l need your blessings mummy.
- Almeida.

1066
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:36,440
Stop following me.
- Where is the kitchen?

1067
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,360
l want to see how you cook food.

1068
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:42,680
- And where is the prayer room?
- Puja has not come on duty today.

1069
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:46,320
Prayer room, where one prays
to the lord.

1070
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:48,440
We don't do that here.

1071
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:51,840
What? There is no prayer
to the lord.

1072
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:54,360
Lord? Who is the Lord?

1073
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:07,640
Counting stars?...

1074
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:13,400
Counting stars?...

1075
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:25,600
London Bridge is falling
down, falling down... up.

1076
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,200
Dear God, How are you?

1077
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:51,880
Please keep papa happy and see that
he doesn't miss me too much.

1078
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:56,760
You know he can't do anything
without me. Okay.

1079
01:55:57,760 --> 01:55:58,720
Caught you.

1080
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:06,200
All prayers for papa,
nothing for mama?

1081
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:10,040
Why ask God for anything for mummy?

1082
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:12,160
Why?
- She's with him.

1083
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:15,040
Whatever she wants,
she can ask for it herself.

1084
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:28,760
Hey! Now go to sleep.
Sweet dreams.

1085
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:37,440
Miss you papa.

1086
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:48,360

How could you know? You just
disappeared.

1124
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:11,040
We changed our residence.
- You changed your friends as well?

1125
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:17,240
When l needed my friend the most,
you were not there.

1126
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:24,160
You didn't marry again?

1127
02:05:25,240 --> 02:05:27,760
Couldn't find you... or else would
have married you.

1128
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:37,560
We live once, die once, get
married once and love...

1129
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,240
Only once.

1130
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:43,320
You didn't get married either?

1131
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:46,040
Couldn't find you.

1132
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:54,840
Hey! Look a shooting star.
- Still believe in it?

1133
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:59,880
No. You?
- No.

1134
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:25,240
What did you wish for?

1135
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:50,360
Granny.

1136
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:54,880
What news?
- Bad news.

1137
02:06:55,640 --> 02:06:58,000
They are behaving like they're
meeting for the first time.

1138
02:06:58,240 --> 02:07:00,160
Good night Rahul,
Good night Anjali.

1139
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:02,600
Now what do we do?

1140
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:07,960
You have any idea granny?

1141
02:07:12,160 --> 02:07:15,480
The solution now lies in
prayer and devotion.

1142
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:21,000
Oh Granny. Now you only
tell me what to do?

1143
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:37,560
What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

1144
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:40,280
ls this what l have taught you?

1145
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:43,600
Big boys don't fight, she's a girl.
- Why are you fighting?

1146
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:45,080
She hit me first.

1147
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:48,520
l just said that girls can play
Basketball and he said...

1148
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:50,520
Boo girls can't play Basketball.

1149
02:07:50,840 --> 02:07:52,400
He said the truth and you
fought with him.

1150
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:55,600
Why! ln college Ms. Anjali beat
you everyday in Basketball.

1151
02:07:55,840 --> 02:08:01,560
Shh! Quiet! Not everyday,
sometimes.

1152
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:06,400
Rahul, you lost everyday.
- Remember Anjali, you lost everyday.

1153
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:09,080
Rahul, you lost everyday.
- No Anjali.

1154
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:10,240
Yes Rahul.

1155
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:12,560
Don't lie in front of
the kids.

1156
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:15,000
What l'm lying?
- So am l lying? Liar.

1157
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:16,960
What?

1158
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:19,600
The truth is you could only
Hey! don't call me a cheater.

1159
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:25,120
That's what you are... a cheater.

1160
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:27,960
Anjali, not cheater.
- Rahul is a cheater.

1161
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:48,480
l challenge you right now,
let's play.

1162
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:54,040
Don't be silly Anjali.

1163
02:08:55,680 --> 02:08:58,200
Why? Are you scared Rahul?

1164
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:03,160
Rahul Khanna is never scared
of anyone.

1165
02:09:05,680 --> 02:09:07,800
We will see.
- We will see.

1166
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:23,480
l'm sure Rahul will win.
- We will see!

1167
02:09:42,080 --> 02:09:43,520
You'll lose again Rahul.

Don't hit me.

1171

What was that!

1172

Hey! Don't call me a cheater.

1174
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:48,880
That's what you are -
a teacher... cheater.

1175

''We were close and yet so far

1184
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:51,320
''Those were strange times

1185
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:59,160
''Where are you lost, l'm right here

''Somethings happen in my heart...''.

1198
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:07,600
Mamata here's your letter.

1199
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:10,920
All your mothers are
complaining that...

1200
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:14,040
you all are not writing to them and
l have complained to your mother...

1201
02:18:14,320 --> 02:18:15,960
...that you don't say anything.

1202
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:22,680
Everyone is going to write
home, in front of me.

1203
02:18:24,480 --> 02:18:25,760
Here pass these on.

1204
02:18:26,880 --> 02:18:28,440
Anjali, come on write a
letter to your mom...

1205
02:19:00,240 --> 02:19:06,360
lf you were here, you'd be proud of
Anjali being your daughter.

1206
02:19:10,400 --> 02:19:11,640
Because she's so nice.

1207
02:19:14,960 --> 02:19:17,720
She has to be, her name's
Anjali after all.

1208
02:19:22,640 --> 02:19:26,040
But the best thing about
her is that...

1209
02:19:28,560 --> 02:19:30,200
...she looks just like you.

1210
02:19:33,160 --> 02:19:36,160
The same eyes, the same face.

1211
02:19:57,760 --> 02:20:00,280
l don't find this family
incomplete anymore...

1212
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:08,600
Hello kids! Good morning.
Are you ready?

1215

No not there, a little higher.

1219

Where is he sending me? Higher.

1220
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:43,640
Little higher. Yes.
- Shall l sit here?

1221
02:20:46,560 --> 02:20:49,560
How do l look?
- Fantastic, beautiful.

1222
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:12,880
What happened?

1223
02:21:14,400 --> 02:21:17,640
l don't know. Something
is missing. Something wrong.

1224
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:21,880
Okay now?

1225
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:31,200
lt's perfect. Shoot it.

1226
02:21:36,680 --> 02:21:39,800
Excuse me. Now one of
just the 2 of you.

1227
02:21:46,240 --> 02:21:47,960
No Mr. Almieda, enough.

1228
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:50,080
Anjali, just one.

1229
02:21:52,240 --> 02:21:54,840
Colonel, please colonel, really.
- Come on Anjali.

1230
02:22:06,560 --> 02:22:09,760
Wow! How can anyone look
so good?

1231
02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:13,880
Yes! Anjali is looking
very nice here.

1232
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:15,720
Really, l didn't even
notice her.

1233
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:24,040
Liar. She's not here so you...
- What to do mother-in-law?

1234
02:22:24,440 --> 02:22:26,920
Aman, Since the wedding is
in December,...

1235
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:28,600
...why don't you go back
to London for a while?

1236
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:31,680
l'm not budging from here.
- Why?

1237
02:22:32,560 --> 02:22:34,360
l don't trust your daughter.

1238
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:39,000
She's taken forever, to agree
for the marriage. Till we don't...

1239
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:40,960
Tie the knot...
- Yes!

1240
02:22:41,120 --> 02:22:44,120
Tie the knot,
l'm not going anywhere.

1241
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:47,080
You love her a lot don't you?

1242
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:48,960
No... Yes.

1243
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:57,040
But l get the feeling
she doesn't love me.

1244
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:04,160
She doesn't, right?

1245
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:10,680
Hey! Mother-in-law...
she doesn't right?

1246
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:14,840
Aman, you've gone mad.

1247
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:23,960
She didn't answer.

1248
02:23:24,520 --> 02:23:26,400
Today we are going to play
a new game.

1249
02:23:26,880 --> 02:23:28,120
lt's called Dumb Charades.

1250
02:23:28,440 --> 02:23:30,040
ln this game there are 2 teams.

1251
02:23:30,720 --> 02:23:32,280
This is team A.

1252
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:35,960
And this is team B.

1253
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:43,400
One team will secretly tell
1 or 2 members of the other team...

1254
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:46,200
...the name of a film.

1255
02:23:46,640 --> 02:23:51,800
The players have to act
out the film.

1256
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:55,600
And make their teammates
guess the name of the film.

1257
02:23:56,160 --> 02:24:00,200
You can't say anything.
Simple! We'll start with team A.

1258
02:24:06,280 --> 02:24:09,480
Yes! But how do l do this?

1259
02:24:17,560 --> 02:24:19,120
Now look, it's like...

1260
02:24:19,400 --> 02:24:22,040
You can't say anything.
Cheating...

1261
02:24:24,120 --> 02:24:26,240
This is cheating,
you are a cheater.

1262
02:24:29,800 --> 02:24:32,040
Come on! Can't you do this much.
Come on.

1263
02:24:42,360 --> 02:24:44,120
Yeah! Everybody yeah!
She's doing it.

1264
02:25:08,400 --> 02:25:09,400
''The Colourful One''.

1265
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:12,600
Yeah! That's right.
- ''The Colourful One'' yes.

1266
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:25,520
You were really sexy!
- Thanks.

1267
02:25:30,320 --> 02:25:32,600
No, no, no,
l can't do this.

1268
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:34,920
Come on granny...

1269
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:39,520
At this age kids! No. no.

1270
02:25:40,840 --> 02:25:42,360
Even l don't see Hindi films,
you know.

1271
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:44,720
l like ''Gone with the wind''.
- Shut up!

1272
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:50,720
Okay son.

1273
02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:53,960
But she's my mom.

1274
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:55,640
You go there.
- Where?

1275
02:25:55,960 --> 02:25:57,560
Go there...
- Why?

1276
02:25:57,920 --> 02:25:59,920
Becuase l'm telling you that's why.
- Granny gone mad.

1277
02:26:00,960 --> 02:26:02,520
Yeah! Now bend.
- Bend.

1278
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:04,760
Like this?

1279
02:26:22,160 --> 02:26:24,360
Mummy... Madhuri...
''How Are We Related''

1280
02:26:29,440 --> 02:26:30,760
lt's my turn.

1281
02:26:35,800 --> 02:26:36,920
There's no such film.

1282
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:38,760
There is papa.
- No there isn't.

1283
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:41,400
There is.
- But l haven't seen any such film.

1284
02:26:41,920 --> 02:26:43,120
But, hey wait a minute.

1285
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:47,160
Ofcourse, it's a film.
l've seen it myself.

1286
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:49,160
But what is the name
of the film.

1287
02:27:02,120 --> 02:27:03,720
Three... three words.

1288
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:12,120
Yes l've understood there
are three words, what else?

1289
02:27:15,400 --> 02:27:18,360
Rahul, what are you doing?
- Your son has gone mad.

1290
02:27:22,520 --> 02:27:24,880
Rahul l can't understand anything,
what are you doing?

1291
02:27:37,360 --> 02:27:38,520
What is it?

1292
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:47,160
l love you...

1293
02:27:54,880 --> 02:27:56,120
Do it again...

1294
02:28:01,720 --> 02:28:03,280
l love you.

1295
02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:13,120
You couldn't do that much?
- No.

1296
02:28:13,680 --> 02:28:15,480
l wish you would've,
we would have won.

1297
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:25,160
Come on kids, hurry up get into
the barn...

1298
02:28:42,720 --> 02:28:44,280
Hey give me that, thanks.

1299
02:28:51,960 --> 02:28:53,400
Have you gone mad?

1300
02:28:57,280 --> 02:28:59,000
l'm feeling very cold.

1301
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:03,560
Come with me. l'll take you
to a place.

1302
02:29:30,880 --> 02:29:32,080
No music.

1303
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:11,960
l love you.

1304
02:32:18,080 --> 02:32:19,800
Hey! l love you too.

1305
02:32:28,080 --> 02:32:31,600
Almeida you can't even
fix a leakage. Go on, go up.

1306
02:32:32,320 --> 02:32:34,240
Mom, did Anjali come here?
- Her she is.

1307
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:35,960
No... not this one,
the other one.

1308
02:32:36,280 --> 02:32:37,880
Here hold this and help.

1309
02:32:45,520 --> 02:32:49,560
l want to talk with you.

1310
02:32:54,400 --> 02:32:55,880
You call this sty a summer camp?

1311
02:32:58,240 --> 02:33:03,320
Hi guys!
Hey, l know you from somewhere.

1312
02:33:03,960 --> 02:33:05,360
Telephone man.

1313
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:10,720
What's up dude.
What're you doing here?

1314
02:33:14,560 --> 02:33:15,880
ls that your Anjali?

1315
02:33:21,360 --> 02:33:22,840
This is my Anjali.

1316
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:28,640
And this, is my Anjali.

1317
02:33:48,120 --> 02:33:50,000
You're just like Michael Jordan.
You're too good.

1318
02:33:50,360 --> 02:33:51,920
l'm not that good.
l've been beaten.

1319
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:56,600
l don't believe it... Who won?

1320
02:33:57,600 --> 02:33:59,640
Anjali.
- Your Anjali.

1321
02:34:00,640 --> 02:34:03,520
No, your Anjali.
- My Anjali...

1322
02:34:04,480 --> 02:34:05,720
She played basketball?

1323
02:34:07,360 --> 02:34:12,400
Tell me, what kind of a girl
was she in college?

1324
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:15,000
She was the life and pride
our college.

1325
02:34:15,360 --> 02:34:17,280
Everyone came to her with
their problems.

1326
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:19,560
Well, nothings changed.

1327
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:22,000
Even l've come to her with
my problem.

1328
02:34:23,840 --> 02:34:25,400
What problem do you have?

1329
02:34:26,880 --> 02:34:30,520
My problem is that
l love her too much, you know.

1330
02:34:31,360 --> 02:34:32,320
l know.

1331
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:37,240
What kind of friend are you?

1332
02:34:38,200 --> 02:34:39,960
You didn't even come
for our engagement.

1333
02:34:40,360 --> 02:34:41,560
You're engaged?

1334
02:34:44,160 --> 02:34:46,360
Yes, but with great difficulty.

1335
02:34:47,160 --> 02:34:49,560
The wedding is in December,
hopefully.

1336
02:34:51,440 --> 02:34:53,240
Hey! Tell your friend...

1337
02:34:54,280 --> 02:34:55,920
lf she doesn't marry
me in December...

1338
02:34:56,320 --> 02:35:00,520
l'll... marry this basketball.

1339
02:35:18,400 --> 02:35:21,080
We live once, we die once,

1340
02:35:22,200 --> 02:35:25,360
we get married once and
love...

1341
02:35:42,400 --> 02:35:44,320
Men are very weak...

1342
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:52,120
They make principles but
don't realise that...

1343
02:35:52,400 --> 02:35:55,160
...no principle can override
the heart.

1344
02:35:57,400 --> 02:36:02,160
And we remind these stubborn
weak men that...

1345
02:36:02,560 --> 02:36:06,360
...bonds of the heart are based
on feelings not principles.

1346
02:36:09,080 --> 02:36:11,160
But these bonds are created...

1347
02:36:11,520 --> 02:36:13,440
...by telling the other person
about one's inner feelings.

1348
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:19,840
Tell him what you feel Anjali.

1349
02:36:24,600 --> 02:36:28,000
Sometimes saying what one feels
can break one's heart.

1350
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:32,280
But by not saying it you won't,
be happy.

1351
02:36:43,400 --> 02:36:46,440
Congratulations and
celebrations,...

1352
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:49,760
...we wish Ms. Anjali a
happy wedded life.

1353
02:36:51,400 --> 02:36:53,960
Congratulations and
celebrations...

1354
02:36:56,640 --> 02:36:58,480
Anjali, you didn't even
tell me.

1355
02:36:59,160 --> 02:37:00,920
Aman told me that you
are getting married.

1356
02:37:04,320 --> 02:37:05,880
Are you happy?

1357
02:37:06,640 --> 02:37:08,120
You are happy, aren't you?

1358
02:37:08,800 --> 02:37:10,720
Having heard this, are
you happy?

1359
02:37:11,520 --> 02:37:13,080
l'm very happy.

1360
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:15,320
Then how can l be happy?

1361
02:37:16,960 --> 02:37:18,200
l don't understand.

1362
02:37:20,640 --> 02:37:24,440
Somethings happen Rahul,
you won't understand.

1363
02:37:33,280 --> 02:37:37,280
Somethings happen Anjali...
you won't understand.

1364
02:37:44,600 --> 02:37:47,920
Uncle, May l ask you something?
- Sure.

1365
02:37:48,360 --> 02:37:50,840
Why are you marrying Ms. Anjali?

1366
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:53,520
What? Why? ls something wrong?

1367
02:37:53,920 --> 02:37:58,680
Yeah! lt's simple.
You're so handsome.

1368
02:38:00,640 --> 02:38:02,200
What happened?
- So good-looking.

1369
02:38:02,480 --> 02:38:04,080
Oh! Thank you so much.

1370
02:38:04,840 --> 02:38:06,720
But Ms. Anjali is not
that good looking.

1371
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:12,600
You're right. She's dark,
fat and short.

1372
02:38:14,520 --> 02:38:16,560
You know, you can get anyone.

1373
02:38:16,960 --> 02:38:18,680
Anyone?
- Yes!

1374
02:38:19,240 --> 02:38:23,040
Then will you marry me?
- Me? No, no, no...

1375
02:38:23,680 --> 02:38:25,080
Why am l that bad?

1376
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:29,240
Then you'll have to find
me a nice girl.

1377
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:31,000
Found her.
- Who?

1378
02:38:31,360 --> 02:38:32,320
She.

1379
02:38:37,480 --> 02:38:40,560
This MTV one? Hi!
This is the Neelam Show... Yo!

1380
02:38:42,880 --> 02:38:44,600
Then what about this Anjali?

1381
02:38:44,800 --> 02:38:46,120
You'll have to find someone
for her too.

1382
02:38:46,320 --> 02:38:48,240
Found him.
- Found him?

1383
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:51,520
Shall l tell you?
- No, no, no...

1384
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:53,400
Please, let me tell you.
- No, no, no...

1385
02:38:56,320 --> 02:38:58,040
l want to leave tonight itself.

1386
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:40,840
Goodbye Mr. Almeida.

1387
02:40:19,360 --> 02:40:20,760
You're leaving?

1388
02:40:24,960 --> 02:40:26,360
Please don't go.

1389
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:40,600
You gave this to Tina when
she was beginning a new life.

1390
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:46,200
Today you are going to begin
a new life...

1391
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:56,760
...and l am sure, you and Rahul will be happy.
Start preparing for the wedding.

1392
02:42:51,440 --> 02:42:53,080
l don't want to wait anymore.

1393
02:42:53,560 --> 02:42:57,000
But Guruji said that there is no
auspicious date before December...

1394
02:42:57,280 --> 02:43:02,680
Mother, dates don't bring
happiness, destiny does...

1395
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:05,880
...and no one can change that.

1396
02:44:22,040 --> 02:44:24,600
Look! Aman's here and
that too on a mule.

1397
02:44:30,720 --> 02:44:32,680
Bindya... Panditji has come. Leave
everything and look after him.

1398
02:44:37,440 --> 02:44:43,800
You are Rahul, right?
- Yes, Anjali and l...

1399
02:44:44,240 --> 02:44:45,560
l know.

1400
02:44:46,240 --> 02:44:48,440
Anjali is getting married today?

1401
02:44:49,880 --> 02:44:54,960
Yes. She decided to get married
so suddenly that...

1402
02:44:55,520 --> 02:44:57,840
...l didn't get any time to
prepare...

1403
02:44:59,480 --> 02:45:05,200
Yes, l'm coming.
Please sit, l'll just be back.

1404
02:45:12,640 --> 02:45:13,600
Anjali!

1405
02:45:15,480 --> 02:45:18,960
They say if you make a
wish on a shooting star...

1406
02:45:19,360 --> 02:45:20,920
...it comes true...

1407
02:48:44,800 --> 02:48:47,080
The auspicious time is running
out, please call the bride.

1408
02:48:48,440 --> 02:48:49,360
Anjali.

1409
02:48:52,920 --> 02:48:55,760
The auspicious time is almost
over, please call the bride.

1410
02:48:58,560 --> 02:49:00,120
Anjali, let's go.

1411
02:49:48,480 --> 02:49:51,320
l'll drag you to the marriage
pandal, l told you so didn't l?

1412
02:50:48,640 --> 02:50:53,040
You know, l always wanted to see
that love in your eyes...

1413
02:50:54,400 --> 02:50:55,840
...that l have in mine.

1414
02:50:57,880 --> 02:51:03,000
Today, l've seen it,
but it's not for me.

1415
02:51:05,520 --> 02:51:10,040
You're mad Anjali.
You've always loved him.

1416
02:51:12,640 --> 02:51:16,200
Ever since you've known love,
understood love,...

1417
02:51:17,440 --> 02:51:19,000
...You've loved only him.

1418
02:51:20,320 --> 02:51:22,040
Rahul is your first love...

1419
02:51:25,120 --> 02:51:28,280
...and no one understands
first love more than l do.

1420
02:51:33,760 --> 02:51:38,840
You were going to give this
all up for me? Stupid!

1421
02:51:42,240 --> 02:51:43,800
How can l come between
this love...

1422
02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:48,760
...that was never mine
in the first place?

1423
02:51:53,920 --> 02:51:56,200
And anyway, someone told
me that...

1424
02:51:56,560 --> 02:51:58,440
...l'm so handsome,
l can get anyone.

1425
02:52:13,280 --> 02:52:15,000
Aman l...

1426
02:52:29,520 --> 02:52:30,680
