<i>(narrator) Fairy tales tell,</i>

2
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,661
<i>stories of magic, of creatures that fly.</i>

3

<i>There's romance and danger</i>

<i>There's good guys and bad guys</i>

<i>the perils of choices we face in our youth.</i>

But our story today is different in theme,

There, now. Oh, dear Ella.

26
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,501

- She gives the worst gifts.
- Not if she can't find the baby.

00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,048
<i>Whoa!</i>

32
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,286
Ah!

33
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:49,324
Lucinda here. Fairy par excellence.

34
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,131
Now, where's the baby?

35
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,300
- Out walking.
- At her grandmother's.

36
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,537
- At her grandmother's.
- Out for a walk.

37
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:04,072
- She's walking, at her grandmother's.
- Either way, as you see, she's not here.

<i>(baby cries)</i>

00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,149
All right.

41
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:18,994
What shall we give
this beautiful little child today?

42
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,625
- What's her name again?
- Ella.

43
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,690
Ah.

44
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,203
Ella of Frell.

45
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,568
Not a very well-behaved
little stinker, is she?

46
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,839
Quiet, please. I can't concentrate here.

47
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:38,847
Ella of Frell,
I give you the gift of obedience.

48
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,711
Now, go to sleep.

49
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,252
Now, wake up.

50
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:56,429
- Isn't it wonderful?
- No, it's terrible.

51
00:03:56,502 --> 00:04:00,233
It's a terrible gift to have to do
what you're told. Take it back.

52
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,570
I have a no-return policy.

53
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:08,274
And if you're going to be ungrateful, I can
always turn her into a squirrel instead.

54
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,511
- A squirrel?
- No, obedience is a lovely gift.

55
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,485
Besides, you should thank me.

56
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:19,491
I've just given you the perfect child.

57
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:29,496
In spite of the spell,
Ella grew up strong of mind.

58
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:34,666
Her gift made her obedient,
but her heart made her kind.

59
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,936
Why don't you go back
to where you came from?

60
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,639
- Yeah.
- Areida. What a stupid name.

61
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,641
- Nobody wants you here.
- I do.

62
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,746
Bite me.

63
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,689
Did you just see what Ella did?

64
00:04:56,663 --> 00:05:00,656
I made your favorite,
so dig in and stuff your face.

65
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,724
I'm gonna get forks.

66
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,204
Sweetie, stop.

67
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,070
I always knew
something was wrong with me.

68
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,979
Can't you take the spell back?
You're a fairy.

69
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,108
I'm only a household fairy, honey.

70
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:21,051
Besides, according to fairy guidelines,

71
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,251
only the fairy who gave you the gift
can take it back, and we've begged her.

72
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,625
Not only that, but she said
she'd turn your mother into a squirrel

73
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:33,598
and take away my eternal youth
if we ever asked her again.

74
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,930
It's not fair.

75
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,870
I know, darling. I know.

76
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:43,739
<i>So Ella now knew</i>
<i>why she'd always obeyed.</i>

77
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,211
<i>But she never stopped fighting</i>
<i>to have things her way.</i>

78
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,875
Ella! Come practice your mandolin.

79
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,049
Fine, but I'll take
my own sweet time doing it.

80
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,055
Hurry up, now.

81
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,484
<i>As she struggled</i>
<i>to find a way out of her gift,</i>

82
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:08,557
<i>she had no way of knowing</i>
<i>something worse was adrift.</i>

83
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,000
Please get well, Mother.

84
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,800
Listen to me.

85
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:18,310
Only Mandy and I know about the gift.

86
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,541
We've never even told your father.

87
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,909
And you must never tell anyone else.

88
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:30,951
- I don't want anyone using it against you.
- Mother, please.

89
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:36,757
Remember, no matter
what anyone says or tells you to do,

90
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,158
look to yourself, Ella.

91
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:46,695
What's inside you
is stronger than any spell.

92
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:04,722
Take this, then I'll always be with you.

93
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,363
<i># A strange magic</i>

94
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,535
<i># Strange magic</i>

00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,807
<i>(Mandy)</i> Ella.

97
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,939
Your father would like to speak to you.

98
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,978
- You're married?
- She has money, Ella.

99
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,318
And she's very fond of my title.

100
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,915
It was either get married or sell the house.

101
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:43,257
You'll adore Dame Olga,
and her two daughters.

102
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,957
She'll make a wonderful mother.

103
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,398
Well, a motherlike figure.

104
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,165
Look, I'm sure
you'll all be the best of friends.

105
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,168
Whoa!

106
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,605
Is this the right address?

107
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,982
There must be some mistake.

108
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,044
My dear, welcome.

109
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,290
And these must be your lovely daughters.

110
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,854
My precious Hattie and my special Olive.

111
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,631
Oh.

112
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,932
- And you must be Ella.
- Pleased to meet you.

113
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,997
Yes. The house looks delightful.

114
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,976
But I do seem to remember
that at the noblemen's convention

115
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,342
you said that you lived in a castle.

116
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,439
No, I said a man's home is his castle.

117
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,283
Hi. I'm Ella. Welcome to Frell.

118
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,286
What's with the prince pinups?

119
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:49,351
Hattie's president
of the Prince Char fan club.

120
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:55,295
Char and his uncle are responsible
for the segregation of the kingdom.

121
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,235
So? He's dreamy.

122
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,340
Is this hutch meant to be a closet?

123
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,004
It's pathetic.

124
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,072
My clothes need more room than this.

125
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,853
- We'll have to use yours.
- Wha...?

126
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,687
Show it to us.

127
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,756
Oh.

128
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,770
It's so... quaint.

129
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:38,136
Almost like, well, it's just ugly, isn't it?

130
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,845
There's no room in here, either.

131
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,785
We're gonna have to throw out
some of your gowns to make room.

132
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:52,915
- Wait. Get away from there!
- You get away.

133
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,686
Oh.

134
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:01,631
What's this? I do actually like this.

135
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,794
Please don't touch it. It was my mother's.

136
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,860
- Can I have it?
- No.

137
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,168
Oh.

138
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,437
It can be your welcome gift to me.

139
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,843
Come on, hand it over.

140
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,741
Oh.

141
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,809
Aren't you accommodating.

144

I know it's not a great job,
not even a good job -

OK, even a monkey could do it -
but we need the money, Ella.

but when King Florian was killed,
allegedly by an ogre,

151

Sir Edgar saw it as an opportunity to exile
all nonhuman creatures to the forest,

keeping their land for himself.

00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:43,124
and he has put giants and elves to work
as laborers and entertainers.

161
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,762
Therefore, if it weren't for him,

162
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:49,604
we wouldn't have today's
thriving free-enterprise system.

163
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:54,135
It's only free because we've enslaved the
poor creatures and they work for nothing.

164
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:59,947
Edgar is a monster, and I don't hold out
much hope for his nephew, either.

165
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:04,046
Well, that shows what you know,
aka nothing.

166
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:08,293
Prince Char will be the greatest king ever.

167
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,023
- Right, girls?
- <i>(all)</i> Yeah.

168
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:16,660
I wonder if my opponent has based
her opinion on the prince's politics

169
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,864
or how cute she thinks his butt is.

170
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:25,342
Admit you're stupid
and don't know what you're talking about.

171
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,380
I'm stupid and I don't know
what I'm talking about.

Hold your tongue, Ella.

Uncle, do I have to go to this mall opening?

181
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,819
As heir to the throne,
it's your royal responsibility, Char.

182
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:13,325
- You are a public figure, after all.
- Yes, but you're the one in charge.

183
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,327
Only for a little while longer.

184
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,727
Your coronation is next week.

185
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,858
You need to be out there
with the people, Char.

186
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:27,304
Yes, shaking hands and kissing babies.

187
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:31,901
Exactly, Heston.
So the people can learn to trust us.

188
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,968
What's not to trust?

189
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,241
Nothing.

190
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:41,275
But while you've been away at school,
Char, the kingdom has been under siege.

191
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:45,187
In your absence,
the ogres have become impossible.

192
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:51,992
He's right. Even the giants have become
more and more treacherous.

193
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,097
But the giants have always been peaceful.

194
00:13:55,167 --> 00:14:00,696
The ogres were peaceful too,
until they ripped your father to shreds.

195
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,504
And I promised your father,
should anything happen to him,

196
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:08,274
I would take care of you and the kingdom.

197
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:13,580
And, well, I've kept my promise, haven't I?

198
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,683
Whoa!

199
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:19,713
Likewise, you must keep
your promise to the people.

200
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:25,492
Now, let's put on a smile.
Remember, image is everything.

You can curtsy or not. That's your choice.
There's really nothing I can do about it.

232
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,851
Except have you beheaded,
but that seems a bit extreme.

Charming. Why don't you do
what your people usually do?

234
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,585
Steal my land and destroy my livelihood.

Wait a second. Come back here.

Ella of Frell.

Well, Ella of Frell,

240
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:57,809
you're the first maiden I've met
who hasn't swooned at the sight of me.

241
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,875
Then maybe I've done you some good.

242
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,854
Look, I've never stolen
anyone's land or livelihood.

243
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:11,055
I want peace in the kingdom
as much as anyone.

244
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,896
So you have a new plan
once you take the crown?

245
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,299
Well...

246
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,237
Sort of. Of course,
I couldn't reveal it to a subject.

247
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,604
That's what I thought.
You're all just the same.

248
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,940
You care more about your fan club
and your next jousting tournament.

249
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:32,040
No, actually, I've never been comfortable
with the whole adoring fan club thing.

250
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:35,416
Perhaps that's why I find
your obvious disdain for me so refreshing.

251
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,583
Obvious? And I was trying
so hard to hide it.

252

Where's my purse? It's back there.

I'm the one you want.
I know everything about you.

I've got posters of you, and pictures.

277

And when we used to live in Lamia,

278
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:52,915
I used to stand outside your castle and
watch you turn your lights on and off.

I don't wanna talk about it.
Olive and Hattie were there.

Hattie. Why do you always do
what Hattie tells you to do?

- I don't.
- Yes, you do.

- I don't.
- Tell the truth.

Oh, I do.

00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,514
Olive, have you noticed
anything strange about Ella?

No, not really.

290

then lighter when the sun comes up?

- Never mind.

I have to go.

- I need you to do me a little favor.

Take that.

OK! OK, that's enough.

We need one more thing.

Take those.

00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,961
Ella, bravo!

316
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,560
Freeze!

317
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,177
Put your hands together.

318
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,250
You're under arrest.

319
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:42,625
A felon in my own family.
I could die from embarrassment.

320
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,924
Promises, promises.

321
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:49,230
- You are a disgrace.
- Maybe she was put up to it.

322
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:56,840
Mandy's right, Mother. We were there.

323
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,706
It really wasn't poor Ella's fault at all.

324
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,905
She was forced to do it.

325
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:06,375
So, Ella, who put you up to it?

326
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,181
- <i>(whispers)</i> Tell her it was Areida.
- Ar...

327
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:13,418
I'm waiting. Tell me who's to blame.

328
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,324
Areida.

329
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,388
Areida! I might have guessed it.

330
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,427
- You are forbidden ever to see her again.
- What?

331
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,869
<i>(Areida)</i> Ella?

332
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:29,338
How dare she come here now?

333
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:33,868
Answer the door and tell her
that you never want to see her again.

334
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:37,403
And tell her you could never be friends
with an Ayorthian.

335
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:40,417
- Dame Olga, there must be some mistake.
- Please, Dame Olga.

336
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:43,318
Don't argue. Just do it.

337
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,223
Thank goodness you're all right.

338
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,692
What's wrong?

339
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,770
I never wanna see you again.

340
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,904
Ha-ha. Very funny.

341
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:16,076
I don't understand.
We're best friends.

342
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:27,558
I could never be friends with an Ayorthian.

343
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,664
Just go.

344
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,178
I've done terrible things before, Mandy,

345
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:48,845
but this is the worst thing
the curse has ever made me do.

346
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,651
I've gotta do it.

347
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:59,789
I have got to find Lucinda
and get her to take back the curse.

348
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,091
You're right.

349
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,035
I have something to show you.

350
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:11,132
This is gonna help you find her.

351
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,506
I should have told you
about this years ago.

352
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:17,548
- But I was a little embarrassed.
- Embarrassed? How?

353
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:22,713
Well, as you know,
I'm not the most talented fairy.

354
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:29,958
Anyway, this book...
is my boyfriend, Benny.

355
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:31,960
Hey.

356
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,625
Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet anyone, quite frankly.

357
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,727
You're the first introduction
I've had in 20 years.

358
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:43,171
- I've never seen anything like this.
- I know. No one has.

359
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:47,075
And I don't want them to,
cos then they might take him away.

360
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:53,778
It was an accident. I was just trying a spell
to trim his hair, and it went a little askew.

361
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:57,015
I would have left her ages ago,
except I love her so darn much.

362
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,420
Plus, I have no legs.

363
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,982
I love you, too, my little Pooky Pages.

364
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,255
Not as much as I love you, Cuddlebuns.

365
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,923
- I love you more.
- OK.

366
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,728
Lots of love. Moving on.

367
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,102
Well, I want you to take him with you.

368
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:16,663
You mean I'm getting out of here?
Beyond these four walls?

369
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,768
There are so many places in my pages
I've been wanting to visit.

370
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,507
Wow. What is all this?

371
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,847
- He knows everything.
- Thanks, sweetie, but not everything.

372
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,284
If I did, I'd be a lot thicker.

373
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,345
Can he show me anything about Lucinda?

374
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:36,122
- Can I show you anything about Lucinda?
- Watch this.

375
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:38,219
Show me Lucinda.

376
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,127
Ta-da!

377
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,894
Cool trick.

378
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:46,461
Now, which Crockery Barn?
They're all over the kingdom.

379
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:47,505
Ah.

380
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:51,633
That's the glitch. He can't tell you where
a person is. He can just show you pictures.

381
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,941
Like a crystal ball or a magic mirror.

382
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:58,779
Everything is so huge.
Is that a wedding registry?

383
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,519
Duh! They're in Giantville.

384
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,390
Look, she's going
to a wedding in Giantville.

385
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,326
- Benny, we're going to Giantville.
- How exciting.

386
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:14,456
<i>(Olga)</i> Ella, the girls and I need bouquets
for our portrait sitting tomorrow.

387
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,523
Go and pick some.

388
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,377
<i># What you want, baby, I got it</i>

389
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:32,480
<i># What you need, cos you know I got it</i>

390
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:38,813
<i># All I'm asking is for a little respect</i>
<i>when you get home, baby</i>

391
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,252
Oh, my God!

392
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:51,759
So, as her stepfamily scratched
their newly found itches,

393
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:56,034
Ella was off, glad to be rid of the... witches.

394
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,008
Benny, can you show me a map
of the Forest of Pim?

395
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,069
Of course.

396
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:06,081
Whoa.

397
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:11,483
According to this map,
if we head due east towards Monster Rock,

398
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:13,581
we can cut half a day off our journey.

399
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,023
<i>(yelp)</i>

400
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,857
- What was that?
- Probably something that wants to eat us.

401
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,829
Ouch!

402
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,128
- <i>(man)</i> Somebody help me!
- <i>(man laughs)</i>

403
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,829
- Wait a minute.
- <i>(man)</i> Sing soprano, little man!

404
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,065
Missed!

405
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,338
What do you think
you're doing to that poor elf?

406
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,503
Oh.

407
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,548
Who's this who thinks she's so tough?

408
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:45,783
Look, I think it's only fair to warn you that
I'm practiced in the ancient art... of origami.

409
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,883
Paper folding?

410
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,486
I was hoping
you wouldn't know what that was.

411
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,863
Don't let him scare you, sweetheart!
Kick his butt!

412
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,593
Don't let her do that.

413
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,139
Now rabbit punch.

414
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:08,303
Combo. Kneel. Front-step kick.
Dragon-roundhouse kick.

415
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,638
This chick is nuts!

416
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,184
Let's get outta here.

417
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,743
I think I'm gonna puke.

418
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,386
Let me help you with that.

419
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,723
I am gonna need
so much therapy after this.

420
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:25,527
Oh!

421
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,794
- Are you OK?
- No, I am not OK!

422
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:32,030
I think I broke something,
or dislocated it, or...

423
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,035
<i>(crunch)</i>

424
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,198
No, just a crick. Slannen of Pim.

425
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,442
Ella of Frell. Nice to meet you.

426
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:48,750
Well, if you're OK,
then I have to be going, but good luck.

427
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,621
You're going? You can't walk in this wood
on your own. How about a bite to eat?

428
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:56,353
That's very sweet,
but I'm on a tight schedule.

429
00:29:56,427 --> 00:30:00,056
Fine. Message received,
Miss "I Think I'm All That".

430
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,567
- That's not what I meant at all.
- I extend the hand of friendship...

431
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,661
- I am on a tight schedule. Were I not...
- Everybody's busy...

432
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:11,835
...I would love to have dinner with you.
- Great! I've got a coupon.

433
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,982
<i>(whispers)</i> Slannen.

If they spot you, you'll be sorry.

You know how all elves
are forced to sing and dance?

437
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,852
Yeah. So?

438
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:36,460
Visitors!

- Places, everyone.
- One, two, three, four!

440
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:42,001
Run for it!

What is this, anyway? Ella's secret diary.

458

Yes. Why don't you like music?

459
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:44,725
That's right. Because elves are supposed
to be so happy and joyful all the time.

460
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,566
Singing and dancing for the man.

Please tell me.

00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,811
I wanna be a lawyer.

Nothing.

00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,020
Elf.

471
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:16,226
I forgot. The elfin restrictions
Sir Edgar passed.

472
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:20,863
No elf shall be engaged in any occupation
other than singing, juggling

473
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,772
and<i>l</i>or tomfoolery.

474
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,366
They're never gonna let me
go to law school.

475
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,742
I'm never gonna get my day in court,

476
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:31,145
never gonna stand
in front of the judge and say

477
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:34,673
"You're out of order!
Permission to approach the bench?"

478
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:36,777
- "I object!"
- No, I object.

479
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:40,415
- I heard it there. It's coming from the book.
- No, it's not.

480
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,618
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

481
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:47,258
Great. I knew it. A talking book.

482
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:52,269
Good. Because for a minute there,
I thought I was going crazy.

483
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,395
<i>#</i> Crazy

484
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:57,464
<i>#</i> I'm crazy for feeling so lonely

485
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:07,483
- What are you doing with Ella's things?
- Just a little tidying up.

486
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:11,181
- What's that?
- What? Nothing. It's personal.

487
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,420
A letter for Ella?

488
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:24,128
The prince's coronation ball.
He's invited that insolent little snip?

489
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:28,161
Girls, go and dust off your ball gowns
and pack your bags.

490
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:33,541
I think I may have found you
another chance at your future husband.

491
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,948
Yes!

492
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,889
So you can really show me anything
anywhere in the kingdom?

493
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:54,830
You're kind of like a walking, talking
encyclopedia, except for the walking part.

494
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,890
- Come on.
- What?

495
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,693
What's going on?

496
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:04,231
Edgar's soldiers rounding up elfin singers
to perform at the coronation.

497
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:07,607
Get in. And you.

498
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:12,548
Slannen, you've gotta go to Lamia
and petition the prince.

499
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,518
- For what?
- To go to law school. You gotta stop this.

500
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:19,852
<i>#</i> The sun will shine

501
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:22,859
<i>(Slannen)</i> You want me to go
to Lamia on my own?

502
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,862
We're going to Giantville.
It's on the way. Come with us.

503
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,730
The prince will never grant an audience
with an elf. They think we're a joke.

504
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:35,262
I have met Prince Charmont, and I think
he might be different than his uncle.

505
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:39,105
- Why? Cos he's a hunk?
- No.

506
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,236
- What is he, about six foot?
- About.

507
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:44,907
Yeah, I hate the guy already.
I'm not wasting my time.

508
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:48,213
Lacking courage as well as height.

509
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,887
Count me in.
Elves aren't that short, you know.

510
00:34:56,461 --> 00:35:00,124
That's just a myth created by that stupid
<i>Elves and the Shoemaker</i> story.

511
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:03,031
- Do I look small enough to fit in a shoe?
- No.

512
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,537
Stinking Grimm Brothers.
Are you sure he knows where he's going?

513
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,903
Hey, I'm right here. Just cos I'm a book
doesn't mean I don't have ears.

514
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:14,308
Boys, if you can't play nice,
you can't play together.

515
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,438
<i>(rustling)</i>

516
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:21,542
Oh, no. The rustling always comes
before the screaming and the running.

517
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,450
I knew this was gonna happen.

518
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:27,958
They'll just find pieces of us
scattered across the forest floor.

519
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:34,021
Oh, a bunny. You know, the last known
case of a bunny attack was, well, never.

520
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,525
It never hurts to be on your guard.

521
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,032
<i>(twig snaps)</i>

522
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:44,370
Nobody panic, nobody panic.
I've got this in hand.

523
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,568
Oi!

524
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,975
You! Thumper!

525
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:51,344
Out of the forest or no more carrots for you.

526
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,181
I don't like carrots.

527
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,884
How do you feel about rabbits,
cos one just went thataway.

528
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:05,122
I am the ogre, Nish.

529
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:10,657
How do you like to be eaten?
Baked, boiled, shish-kebabbed?

530
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,329
How about free range?

531
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,970
Stop! No!

532
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:20,340
Ella of Frell. Hi, how are you doing?

533
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:25,280
I think there's been a big mistake here.
See, I'm pro-ogre.

534
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,839
Pro-ogre?

535
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:30,854
Absolutely. I led a rally on your behalf
the other day. Maybe you heard about it.

536
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:35,723
It'll only hurt for a moment, I promise.
I'm a fast eater.

537
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:41,153
Slannen, Slannen!
Please, I want to help.

538
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:43,826
Help? From a human?

539
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,163
Humans took everything from us.

540
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:51,140
I was an ogre of leisure, with a simple life.

541
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,372
- Next thing you know...
- Now, not this again.

542
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:58,643
Nish, hurry up. I'm starving.

543
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,412
Right, you, into the pot.

544
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:07,248
Forget that.

545
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:12,019
- Who are you?
- I am the ogre, Nish.

546
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:16,422
We just did this. Didn't we just do this?

547
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,594
All right, that's enough fun and games.

548
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,935
Now, keep your mouth shut
and don't move.

549
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,243
Is it boiling yet?

550
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,748
It's not gonna boil
if you stand there looking at it.

551
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,650
You couldn't show a picture
of a big ogre heading our way?

552
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,416
- That would have been helpful.
- Oh! Oh!

553
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,787
I think I see bubbles.

554
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,552
<i>(horse neighs)</i>

555
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:50,266
Let her go!

556
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,814
Untie yourself.

557
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,845
Truce! Truce!

558
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:47,049
Can't we just get along?

559
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:51,222
Are you one of the monsters
who killed my father?

560
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:54,958
King Florian was a good man.
We lived in peace during his reign.

561
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,364
Why would we kill him?

562
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:05,239
I'll spare your lives
where you didn't spare his.

563
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:09,245
You take your friends
and find breakfast elsewhere.

564
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,781
We'll pick up something else on the way.

565
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:16,047
Anyway, you eat maiden,
an hour later you're hungry again.

566
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:25,357
What are you doing here,
with an elf for protection?

567
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,829
Do you get a kick
out of near-death experiences?

568
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:31,334
No. I was fine. I had things well in hand.

569
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:34,599
I could see that, as you were dangling
over the boiling cauldron,

570
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:37,698
no doubt lulling the ogres
into a false sense of security.

571
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:41,506
Who's to say it wouldn't have worked
if you hadn't come barging in?

572
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,743
I see the score currently stands
at chivalry two, gratitude zero.

573
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,807
Look...

574
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,522
You're right. I'm sorry.

575
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,923
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

576
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:58,257
- You're bleeding.
- Hm?

577
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,354
Oh, it's just a scratch.

578
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:03,594
You'd better let me help you with that.

579
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:14,473
- So, will I live?
- I think the odds are in your favor.

580
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,348
So... where were you headed?

581
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,817
The giants' village for a wedding.
I'm meeting my godmother.

582
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,548
That's on our way back to Lamia.
We'll accompany you.

583
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,283
That's not necessary.

584
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:31,056
It makes it so much easier rescuing you
if I don't have to commute.

585
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:38,330
I'm so glad I was here
for this interesting development.

586

<i>(Heston groans)</i>

587

588
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:45,832
Come with us.

589
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:59,186
So, traveling with an elf?
Your boyfriend couldn't make it?

590
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:00,985
- No.
- Oh.

591
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:03,549
- Because I don't have one.
- Oh.

592
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,126
Your girlfriend doesn't mind
being left alone?

593
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,429
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- Oh?

594
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:14,267
- I have many.
- Oh.

595
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:21,369
I'm kidding. Shouldn't believe
everything you read in <i>Medieval Teen.</i>

596
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:24,937
Excuse me. Excuse me.

597
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:27,882
Prince Charmont, permission to speak?

598
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:31,888
- Sure.
- You know the word coincidence?

599
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:35,824
It just so happens I was on my way
to meet a certain royal someone

600
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:39,989
in order to discuss some career options
currently unavailable to...

601
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:44,524
Slannen wants to petition the kingdom
for the right to become a lawyer.

602
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,433
- A lawyer?
- Why not?

603
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:50,463
There were no laws against it
when your father was king.

604
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,601
That's not really my area of expertise.

605
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,874
My advice to you
would be to talk to my uncle.

606
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:59,677
I'm sure if you make a good argument,
he'll come round.

607
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:04,312
Well, thank you for your... advice.

608
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,131
- What?
- You're about to become king.

609
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:20,569
You'll have the power to make a difference
in the world and you don't even care.

610
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:24,972
It's not like I asked to become king.
I've had no say in the matter.

611
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:28,910
Well, thanks to your uncle, there are a lot
of people who have no say in the matter.

612
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:32,039
Nobody should be forced to do things
they don't wanna do.

00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,778
Take it from somebody who knows.

00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,800
<i>(Ella)</i> Maybe you can get
to the bottom of this at the wedding.

621
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:28,770
<i>(Char)</i> Maybe you can find
your godmother.

622
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:00,701
<i>(Ella)</i> Whoa.

623
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:06,306
They're not so bad.
I thought they'd be all so big and scary.

624
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:10,744
Didn't hurt.

625
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,806
I hope this is a good idea.
They must hate the royal family.

626
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,478
They'll respect your courage
at showing up here.

627
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:21,115
Besides, they don't hold grudges.
They're bigger than that.

628
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:24,251
Prince Charmont.
What are you doing here?

629
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,728
No grudges, eh?

630
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:31,791
Well, I thought that maybe this would be a
good time to possibly have a heart-to-heart.

631
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:37,205
But now I'm thinking I should come back
when there's been a little less drinking.

632
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:41,267
He's here as a friend
to hear your complaints.

633
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,711
Then welcome.

634
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:47,273
I'm looking for someone.
My godmother, Lucinda.

635
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,342
She was over there earlier.

636
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:56,816
Thank you. I'll be right back.

637
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,766
Excuse me. Is Lucinda Perriweather here?

638
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:11,069
Too late, sweetheart.
She left about an hour ago.

639
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,803
Do you know where I can find her?

640
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:17,335
Last I heard,
she was somewhere living in Lamia.

641
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:20,110
Do you know where the bathroom is?

642
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,382
Benny, show me Lucinda.

643
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,688
Looks like she's getting an FWI.

644
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:32,559
- FWI?
- Flying while intoxicated.

645
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:36,730
- She could be anywhere.
- Ow!

646
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,234
Sorry.

647
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,469
Agh!

648
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,379
Ooh.

649
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:59,013
I'd no idea things were so bad.

650
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,786
I promise, first thing after my coronation,
I'll help you buy your farms back.

651
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,953
I'll hold you to that.

652
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:07,553
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- No problem. We were done.

653
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:10,122
That's a fine young man you have here.

654
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:14,298
He's not fine. I mean, mine. He is fine...

655
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,698
Never mind.

656
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,676
So have you seen Slannen?
We have to leave.

657
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:23,872
My godmother's on some kind of bender.

658
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,347
You can't leave now.
It's the middle of the night.

659
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:29,749
You have to stay for the party.

660
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,152
OK, I'll stay.

661
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:37,655
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but you don't have to stay.

662
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:41,960
I don't wanna make you do
anything you don't wanna do.

663
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:46,300
Thank you, Char. For everything.

664
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,361
So I'll see you around?

665
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:56,335
But I wish you would stay.

666
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:03,543
I guess one more night wouldn't hurt.

667
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,916
Mmm. Yuck.

668
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,996
So you're looking
for your godmother Lucinda?

669
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:18,091
She was supposed to be here,
and now I have no idea where she is,

670
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,968
and I need to find her
as soon as possible bec...

671
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,909
Because I miss her.

672
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,968
OK.

673
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:32,810
- Did you think of trying the hall of records?
- No.

674
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:36,375
We have every year's census in the castle.

675
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:41,220
It's not open to everyone,
but I could probably pull a few strings.

676
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:44,488
Char, I can't tell you
what that would mean to me.

677
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:48,053
Well, then, it's settled.
You come with me to Lamia tomorrow.

678
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,792
OK.

679
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:52,999
- I gotta hide. They're after me.
- Who?

680
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:56,005
The giants.
They want me to sing. I don't sing!

681
00:47:56,073 --> 00:48:00,237
There he is. There's our little entertainer.

682
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:07,847
Mr Koopooduk, I know you may find this
hard to believe, but Slannen doesn't sing.

683
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:11,911
- Well, how about you, then?
- Me? Oh, no. I couldn't.

684
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:15,254
- Now, come on.
- Please don't.

685
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:17,520
Sing.

I love singers.

Really?

737
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:04,952
Because, you know,
being an elf, I love to sing.

738
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:07,785
You know, I hope
you don't mind me saying this,

739
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:12,852
but you're much prettier
than I would have expected.

740
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:17,389
Oh, I know. Giants are supposed
to be big, ugly and mean.

741
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:20,732
It's because of stories
like <i>Jack and the Beanstalk.</i>

742
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,295
Stinking Grimm Brothers.

743
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,176
I've seen weirder couples.

744
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:33,342
None that immediately come to mind,
but still.

745
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:37,250
My stepsister Hattie would die
if she knew I was here.

746
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,686
She's the president
of your fan club, you know.

747
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:42,953
Oh, Hattie, yes. Thank you.

748
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:47,725
Now I know what name
to put on the restraining order.

749
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:52,063
No, you're lucky.
I wish I had brothers and sisters.

750
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:56,234
My mother passed away
before she had any more children and...

751
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,797
My mother passed away, too.

752
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:03,235
Oh.

753
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:07,780
You know, she used to sing me
to sleep every night.

754
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:13,790
My father used to sing to me,
loudly and very off-key, but...

755
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,848
I still miss him.

756
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,053
I have Edgar, I guess.

757
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:22,258
He's not such a bad guy.
He risked his life to save my father.

758
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:25,495
And he brought me up as his own son.

759
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:27,833
I know you don't like his politics much,

760
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:32,932
but I'm sure when I tell him about
the giants, he will correct the situation.

761
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,773
Yeah, or you could.

762
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:40,373
It took a lot of guts for you to come here.
Look at the way you smoothed things over.

763
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,782
You're a natural at this.

764
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,887
Wow, is that almost a compliment?

765
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:53,619
Almost. Now, don't go getting a big head.
Your crown won't fit.

766
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:56,723
You know what else?
Tomorrow I'm gonna go to my uncle

767
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,826
and I'm gonna ask him
to repeal the elfin restrictions.

768
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:04,738
Slannen will have his day in court,
if I have anything to say about it.

769
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:18,882
I think you're gonna be
a great king someday.

770
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:21,549
Your father would have been proud.

771
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:25,458
Thanks.

772
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:31,929
I think he would have really liked you.

773
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,941
Kiss me.

774
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:51,479
That wasn't an order, you know.

775
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:57,223
I know.

776
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:38,362
I want to look 25 at tonight's ball.
What do you suggest?

777
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,460
A time machine?

778
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:43,597
May I recommend our newest procedure?

779
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:47,805
Bat faeces and oxen blood.

780
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,003
Batox.

781
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:55,278
Works wonders, although I do caution you,

782
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,980
some people have
a temporarily bad reaction.

783
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:01,490
- Olga.
- Peter, what are you doing here?

784
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:05,790
I'm in town on business and heard
you were here. I came to see Ella.

785
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,831
- Is Ella here?
- Of course. Where else would she be?

786
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:14,495
She's... she's... with Hattie and Olive,
taking a tour of the castle.

787
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:23,342
Next we move into the castle lobby.

788
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,574
I can't believe it.

789
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:29,015
Prince Char walked on this actual floor!

790
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,988
Ladies, ladies, ladies!

791
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,024
Stop tonguing the foyer.

792
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:37,116
<i>(all groan)</i>

793
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:40,856
- Show us where Char showers.
- <i>(excited giggling)</i>

794
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,865
I bet he showers naked!

795
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:58,076
- Hold it, pipsqueak.
- I'm with the prince. And I'm not that short.

796
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:00,946
- Are you singing at the coronation?
- Heck, no.

797
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:03,781
No elves in the palace
unless they're performing.

798
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:06,344
Discrimination. Intentional infliction of...

799
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,482
Whoa!

800
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,085
...bodily harm.

801
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:16,929
These portraits
were recently commissioned

802
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,629
in honor of tomorrow's coronation.

803
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:22,568
<i>(women gasp)</i>

804
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,567
<i>(women scream)</i>

805
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,411
Right, follow me.

806
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:35,474
What are they doing here?

807
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:39,545
I don't mean to rush, but now I really need
to find my godmother, and Slannen, too.

808
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:42,887
- Where is he?
- My uncle'll send the guards to find him.

809
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:47,157
Everything's gonna be fine.
Don't forget, you are with the future king.

810
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,926
- Char.
- Hello, Uncle.

811
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,432
I've been looking all over for you.

812
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:57,496
And who might
this charming young lady be?

813
00:57:57,574 --> 00:58:01,601
This is Ella. Ella of Frell.

814
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:03,873
Ella, this is my Uncle Edgar.

815
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:09,478
And this is his... Heston.

816
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,877
Hey.

817
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:16,222
So, I trust your journey was pleasant?

818
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:19,887
We had a little run-in with some ogres,
but Char got the best of them.

819
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:22,523
You could have been killed.

820
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:28,231
Ah, well. One just has to grin and bear it,
I always say. Grin and bear it.

821
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:34,410
So, Char, might I trouble you
for a moment?

822
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:38,174
The crown maker needs to see you
in your chambers for a fitting.

823
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:44,380
Sure. I just have to take Ella to the...
to the hall of records.

824
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:48,555
Yes, well, hop to it, then, both of you.

825
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,759
You were right about that girl. Very odd.

826
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:04,898
And I'm afraid she's been
filling our prince's head

827
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:08,239
with dangerous new thoughts.

828
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:14,740
Here's the latest census. Names are listed
first by location then species.

829
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:16,682
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

830
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:19,916
Sorry I couldn't be of more help,
but I don't have a census.

831
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:24,619
I mean, look at the size of that thing.
I do have a restaurant guide.

832
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:27,527
Lucinda, I hope you're in here.

833
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:42,107
Ella has lots of interesting opinions about
the kingdom, Uncle. You should hear them.

834
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:44,009
I can't wait.

835
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,414
The giants' working conditions,
for instance. They're unbelievable.

836
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:52,215
Luckily, I've talked to them
and they're definitely open for negotiation.

837
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:58,284
The only negotiations between me and the
giants will be over our vegetable deliveries.

838
00:59:58,361 --> 00:59:59,794
<i>(Heston laughs)</i>

839
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:01,727
Good one, sire.

840
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,631
This isn't a joke, Uncle Edgar.

841
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:14,101
We'll talk about it
after your coronation, yes?

842
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:18,079
Fine, but we will talk.

843
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:20,479
Of course.

844
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,450
I... I'm going to ask her to marry me.

845
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:35,962
Who? This... this Ella of Frell?

846
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:40,025
Yes. Tonight, at the ball.

847
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:43,937
At the same time and in the same place
as my father proposed to my mother.

848
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:48,376
- <i>(Hattie)</i> Get off! Do you know who I am?
- <i>(guard)</i> Come with me.

849
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:53,279
- What now?
- <i>(Hattie)</i> Get off! Get off me!

850
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:57,786
- So, Ella of Frell is your sister.
- <i>(Hattie drinks noisily through straw)</i>

851
01:00:57,854 --> 01:01:00,846
- Stepsister, actually.
- Really?

852
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:05,689
Tell me, what do you know about her?

853
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:07,593
What's in it for me?

854
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:13,068
How about that your eyeballs
remain inside your head?

855
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:19,131
Now, now, Heston.

856
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:23,577
We like these girls. They're our friends.

857
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:29,449
I can't find anything in any of these books.

858
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,851
Benny, show me Lucinda.

859
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:35,087
<i>(Benny)</i> No, still sacked out.

860
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,951
I don't know where else to...

861
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,161
Dun Flyin Retirement Community
for Faeries?

862
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:52,397
Why don't we just cut to the chase, hm?

863
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:59,172
I might even be willing
to throw Prince Char into the deal.

864
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:04,276
Let's see, now. After the coronation
he'll need to take a queen,

865
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:09,552
and shall we say... his hand in marriage?

866
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,521
Queen Olive.

867
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:17,432
For the eldest daughter, of course.

868
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:23,132
Ella does everything she's told.

869
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:28,143
I don't know why, but she does.
She can't help it.

870
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:32,044
Lucinda Perriweather,

871
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:35,516
Dun Flyin Retirement Community
for Faeries, Lamia Heights.

872
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,110
Benny! Benny, we got her.

873
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:40,314
Hello, Ella.

874
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:47,758
I hope you've found everything
to your satisfaction?

875
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:51,630
- Yes, thank you.
- Good, good.

876
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:57,270
Oh, dear. How clumsy of me. Pick it up.

877
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:02,937
Very good.

878
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:06,106
Now touch your toes.

879
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:07,410
Oh, no.

880
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:10,179
Oh, yes. And while you're about it,

881
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:15,691
why don't you pat your head
and rub your tummy at the same time?

882
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:19,217
Now jump up and down.

883
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:25,366
- Please stop.
- Wait.

884
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:28,130
Perhaps you know this one.

885
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:33,608
<i>#</i> Put your left foot in, your left foot out

886
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:36,645
<i>#</i> Put your left foot in

887
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:39,146

889
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:45,577
This is fabulous!

890
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:51,321
Hate to be a party pooper,
but, Edgar, evil plans, remember?

891
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:53,885
Yes, you're right. OK, stop.

892
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:05,631
As you know, tonight is the coronation ball.

893
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:09,134
At some point,

894
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:14,809
amidst your frolicking and romancing,

895
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:21,454
Prince Char will sweep you away
to the hall of mirrors.

896
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:28,057
Then, just before midnight,

897
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:33,124
he will take you by the hand
and ask you a question.

898
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:37,072
How do you know all this?

899
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:40,165
We know everything, my dear.

900
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:45,044
And the one thing we know
with most certainty

901
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:50,381
is that at the stroke of midnight
you will take this dagger

902
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:54,787
and plunge it
through his heart and kill him.

903
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:56,848
No! No, I won't!

904
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:59,417
Oh, yes, you will.

905
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:03,056
You will, because I order you to.

906
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:08,927
<i>(Edgar chuckles)</i>

907
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:16,773
Actually, it's lucky you're here,
so I won't have to do it myself.

908
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,542
You'd kill your own nephew?

909
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:23,915
Why not? I killed my own brother.

910
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:27,217
What? Why?

911
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:30,953
- I want to be king.
- Duh!

912
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:33,018
Now go.

913
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:37,292
Wait.

914
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:40,460
There's one more thing.

915
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:44,597
You will tell no one of this plan.

916
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,916
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Lucinda Perriweather.

917
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:02,219
- It's kind of urgent.
- Sorry. She was kicked out last week.

918
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:05,089
- Do you know where I could find her?
- Nope.

919
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:10,030
You don't understand. If I don't find her,
something terrible's going to happen.

920
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:13,466
Finding her would be something terrible.

921
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:21,775
<i>(Ella) Dear Char.</i>

922
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:26,838

01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:29,976

What are you doing? Never mind.

This may sound strange,
but there's something I need you to do.

935

You are one freaky chick.

936
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:27,070
I need you to go back into the forest and
rally all the elves and giants you can find.

937
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:30,670
- You want me to go back in there?
- You'll need all the help you can get.

938
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:34,512
Someone has to get into the castle, find
Benny and keep Char away from Edgar.

939
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:38,178
- Why? What's going on?
- I already told you, I can't tell you.

you might very well be stuck
singing "Kumbaya" the rest of your life.

Fine! Into the forest of certain death

- I need you to take the gift back.
- Take it back? I don't think so.

It's not that I'm not grateful for the gift.

I'm about to do something horrible
to this guy I really like and might even love.

Everybody loves my gifts.

I will do anything you ask.
Please take it back.

You don't like my gift? Fine.

Get rid of it yourself.
Don't blame me for your problems.

No.

And, in fact, just to prove
what a gem I am... I'll unchain you.

What? No! No!

Aren't I fabulous?

989
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:13,128

- Go get down with the prince.

Please tell me
you never wanna see me again.

I will if you tell me that you don't love me.

- It's not that.
- Then why did you write me that letter?

Tell me how you really feel about me.

1010

I love you. But I am wrong for you, Char.
I am wrong for the kingdom.

1011

Is that what this is about?
Ella, that's crazy.

1012

Come with me.

When I was little,
my father brought me in here.

1015
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:31,095
He told me to look in the mirror
and see myself as a great leader.

1016
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:36,039
Somehow, I never could.

1017
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:39,012
And then you come along.

1018
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,413
Ella, what's wrong?

1019
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:46,082
I wish I could tell you.
I wish I could tell you everything.

Well, except for the bit
where we almost got eaten by ogres.

1022
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:57,695
And you wrote me a letter
that ripped my heart out.

1023
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:00,428
And I had to dance with Hattie.

1024
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:04,165
But none of these things matter.

1025

- I know, I know.

I'm scared, too.

1031

She was just toying

01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:09,150
All right. We just have to find a way
to get past those guards.

1081
01:18:09,217 --> 01:18:12,675
<i>(Benny)</i> Help! Please,
somebody get me out of here!

1082
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:15,587
Benny? What's he doing here?

1083
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:18,620
Ugh!

1084
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,322
- Slannen, you've saved my life.
- Are you OK?

1085
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:25,093
- I could kiss you.
- I think a nice thank-you note is enough.

1086
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:27,192
I think Ella's in trouble.

1087
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:30,238
Something to do with Edgar.
We have to find her.

1088
01:18:30,305 --> 01:18:32,637
Show me Ella.

1089
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:36,741
Edgar's done this?

1090
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:43,184
We've gotta go in there and stop him.
It'll take courage, bravery...

1091

<i>(Elves scream)</i>

1092
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:49,887
I was gonna ask you
how you'd like to be eaten,

1093
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:54,020
but if it's Edgar you're after... count us in.

1094
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:59,259
Welcome aboard.

1095
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:03,529
Executioner coming through.

1096
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:05,596
Enter.

1097
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:12,804
- Help.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1098
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:32,399
Open up. I'm Miss Frell's
legal representation.

1099
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:35,595
- Her what?
- Her lawyer, numbskull.

1100
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:38,036
If the gauntlet doesn't fit,
you must acquit.

1101
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:41,974
Now, open this door before I sue you
for everything you own.

1102
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:44,978
Now, move it! Come on! Come on!

1103
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:51,110
Thank you. Slannen of Pim is not an elf
easily drawn into a legal battle,

1104
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:56,681
but when faced with a challenge
to equality, freedom and civil liberties,

1105
01:19:56,758 --> 01:20:00,319
this elf will draw the sword of justice.

1106
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:04,923
And, furthermore...
Excuse me, what is going on here?

1107
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:09,994
- Well, can we at least take him to go?
- Put the nice man down.

- <i>(Ella)</i> Slannen?

Ella!

01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:22,944

01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:28,018
I'm fine, but Char might not be.
Show me Edgar.

- <i>(Ella)</i> He's poisoned it.

For today you are here to witness
the crowning of a king.

Bring in the crown.

1120

Drop that crown!

- <i>(Char)</i> Ella?
- Seize them!

It's payback time.

Kill them, and anyone

Oh, my God!

No! No, no, no, no!

I can't believe I'm saving you,
after you tried to kill me.

1129
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:03,802
I didn't try to kill you.

You get away from her!

1131
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,884
- Take this!
- <i>(Benny)</i> Hey!

1132
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:16,751
That dagger you were about to plunge into
my back was an early wedding present?

1133
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,850
Hello! Help!

Fairies in kingdoms across the land,

1136
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:29,561
please help me turn Benny
back into a man.

1137
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:35,002
A pumpkin?

1138
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:39,979
OK, maybe I did try to kill you,
but that wasn't me.

1139
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:44,083
- What?
- Maybe it was me, but it wasn't my fault.

1140
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:00,861
Then Edgar found out about the curse
and he ordered me to kill you.

1141
01:24:01,469 --> 01:24:03,494
So I had to break up with you,

1142
01:24:03,571 --> 01:24:08,065
even though I'm pretty sure that you're
the best thing that's ever happened to me.

1143
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:11,579
That crown he's about to put
on your head, it's poisoned.

1144
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:13,773
Duck.

1145
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:16,540
Whoa.

- Edgar's trying to kill me?
- Yes. Hold on.

Excuse me. Thank you.

Char, there's one more thing.

1150
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:37,335
He killed your father.

1151
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:41,601
What? That can't be true.

1152
01:24:41,676 --> 01:24:43,735
Well, of course it's not true.

1153
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:50,581
Who are you gonna believe? This lying
little twit, or the man who raised you?

Uh-oh.

Well, I guess that answers that question.

You vile little girl.

I should have disposed of you

You almost destroyed this kingdom.

You killed my father, your own brother.
How could you?

How could I?

1163

I wanted something,
he was in my way, I got rid of him.

You are never to kiss him again.

You wanna bet?

1176
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:43,694
