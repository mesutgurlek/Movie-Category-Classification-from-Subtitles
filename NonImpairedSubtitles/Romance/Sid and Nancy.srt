01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:06,241
I faced 'em all

955
01:00:06,242 --> 01:00:09,494
and the world

956
01:00:09,495 --> 01:00:15,500
and did it my way

957
01:00:15,501 --> 01:00:17,419
[continues]
I've loved

958
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,963
and then a snide

959
01:00:19,964 --> 01:00:22,007
I've had my fill
[grunts]

960
01:00:22,008 --> 01:00:26,011
My share of losing

961
01:00:26,012 --> 01:00:27,971
and now

962
01:00:27,972 --> 01:00:30,765
the tears subside

963
01:00:30,766 --> 01:00:33,393
I find it all

964
01:00:33,394 --> 01:00:35,979
so amusing

965
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:38,481
to think
[audience screaming]

966
01:00:38,482 --> 01:00:40,984
I killed a cat

967
01:00:40,985 --> 01:00:43,945
[gunfire continues]
And may I say

968
01:00:43,946 --> 01:00:46,948
out in the driveway

969
01:00:46,949 --> 01:00:48,908
and no

970
01:00:48,909 --> 01:00:52,954
no, no, not me

971
01:00:52,955 --> 01:00:59,459
I did it my way

972
01:01:34,705 --> 01:01:40,208
it seems like
all my friends are dead.

973
01:01:45,549 --> 01:01:51,427
When I'm dead,
will you be sad?

974
01:01:53,265 --> 01:01:58,184
I couldn't live
without you.

975
01:01:59,146 --> 01:02:03,607
- You couldn't?
- No.

976
01:02:03,608 --> 01:02:09,028
We better
go together then.

977
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:14,992
How should we do it?

978
01:02:15,453 --> 01:02:18,497
We could...

979
01:02:18,498 --> 01:02:23,085
jump off a building.

980
01:02:23,086 --> 01:02:27,548
Throw ourselves
under a subway.

981
01:02:27,549 --> 01:02:32,009
O.d.

982
01:02:34,973 --> 01:02:39,977
If I asked you to kill me,

983
01:02:39,978 --> 01:02:44,480
would you?

984
01:02:44,524 --> 01:02:50,527
What...
what would i do?

985
01:02:51,531 --> 01:02:56,033
I couldn't live
without you.

986
01:02:56,035 --> 01:02:58,578
You'd kill yourself
too, then?

987
01:02:58,579 --> 01:03:00,539
Yeah.

988
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:06,043
Yeah. Yeah.

989
01:03:17,974 --> 01:03:20,892
Shit.

990
01:03:20,893 --> 01:03:24,813
I hate this fucking life.
[Crying]

991
01:03:24,814 --> 01:03:29,693
No, this is...
this is just a rough patch.

992
01:03:29,694 --> 01:03:33,113
Things will be much better when
we get to America, I promise.

993
01:03:33,114 --> 01:03:36,992
We're in America.

994
01:03:36,993 --> 01:03:39,953
What?

995
01:03:39,954 --> 01:03:41,955
We've been here
a week.

996
01:03:41,956 --> 01:03:46,960
New York is in America,
you fuck.

997
01:03:46,961 --> 01:03:48,962
What? Couldn't be.

998
01:03:48,963 --> 01:03:51,506
A week?
Yeah.

999
01:03:51,507 --> 01:03:54,384
What day is it?

1000
01:03:54,385 --> 01:03:57,387
Oh, shit.
Is it tuesday or wednesday?

1001
01:03:57,388 --> 01:04:00,932
We're supposed to be at grandma
and grandpa's on wednesday.

1002
01:04:00,933 --> 01:04:03,434
Where's my fuckin' book?
[Papers rustling]

1003
01:04:03,435 --> 01:04:07,937
Shit.

1004
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:14,402
God.

1005
01:04:17,908 --> 01:04:20,451
[Siren wailing]

1006
01:04:20,452 --> 01:04:25,371
[Horns honking]

1007
01:04:29,294 --> 01:04:34,797
[Sirens, horns continue]

1008
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:49,272
No! Look!
There's the rollerama!

1009
01:04:49,273 --> 01:04:53,317
Sid, I won a roller skating trophy there
when I was six years old.

1010
01:04:53,318 --> 01:04:55,861
Nancy, don't fib.
Fuck you, grandma.

1011
01:04:55,862 --> 01:04:58,322
- Oh, no!
- [Horns honking]

1012
01:04:58,323 --> 01:05:04,827
[Sid laughing]
This place is a fucking paradise.

1013
01:05:05,831 --> 01:05:09,834
You guys gotta come see us in New York
when I get Sid some gigs.

1014
01:05:09,835 --> 01:05:13,337
Can't he cut his own meat?
They really want him at Max's.

1015
01:05:13,338 --> 01:05:16,799
They're too fuckin' cheap.
They only wanna pay him three grand.

1016
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,343
I mean,
he's worth five at least.

1017
01:05:19,344 --> 01:05:24,348
Sid's a really big star
in New York. We both are.

1018
01:05:24,349 --> 01:05:26,308
[Chuckling]
Yeah, yeah.

1019
01:05:26,309 --> 01:05:28,811
God, we barely have
any time to ourselves.

1020
01:05:28,812 --> 01:05:31,355
We don't even have time
to get to the methadone clinic.

1021
01:05:31,356 --> 01:05:33,315
We've only got enough
for two days.

1022
01:05:33,316 --> 01:05:38,320
Grandma, can I borrow the car?
I wanna teach Sid how to drive American.

1023
01:05:38,321 --> 01:05:41,365
Mom, how come Nancy gets to
borrow grandma's car and I don't?

1024
01:05:41,366 --> 01:05:43,325
She's the one who got fucked up
and wrecked it.

1025
01:05:43,326 --> 01:05:45,828
Shut up.
What do you know, crater face?

1026
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:48,872
Fuckin' twerp. Too bad
about your brothers, Mary Jane.

1027
01:05:48,873 --> 01:05:53,834
Still taking idiot lessons?

1028
01:05:54,838 --> 01:06:01,343
So, are you gonna make an honest
woman out of our Nancy, Sid?

1029
01:06:01,344 --> 01:06:04,388
Well, she's always
been honest to me.

1030
01:06:04,389 --> 01:06:06,348
Grandpa, sir.

1031
01:06:06,349 --> 01:06:08,850
She's never lied to me.

1032
01:06:08,851 --> 01:06:13,355
But what are your,
uh, intentions?

1033
01:06:13,356 --> 01:06:15,357
Well, first off,

1034
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:19,403
we're gonna go down to
the methadone clinic on monday,

1035
01:06:19,404 --> 01:06:22,864
and then Nancy's
gonna get me some gigs.

1036
01:06:22,865 --> 01:06:25,909
And then we're gonna go off
and, like, live in Paris...

1037
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:30,872
and just sort of go out
in a blaze of glory.

1038
01:06:30,873 --> 01:06:36,376
But don't worry.
You'll be proud of us.

1039
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:41,925
So why don't we go down
to the rec room?

1040
01:06:41,926 --> 01:06:44,844
Fuck this and fuck that

1041
01:06:44,845 --> 01:06:47,639
fuck it all, you fuckin'
fuckin' brat

1042
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:50,767
I don't want a baby
who looks like that

1043
01:06:50,768 --> 01:06:53,895
she don't want a baby
that looks like that

1044
01:06:53,896 --> 01:06:55,855
fucking

1045
01:06:55,856 --> 01:06:58,149
a fucking animal

1046
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:00,360
[coughing]

1047
01:07:00,361 --> 01:07:05,363
Oh, that's...
that's an old one.

1048
01:07:05,366 --> 01:07:07,408
So, what else
should we do, huh?

1049
01:07:07,409 --> 01:07:09,661
Oh, no more.
I'm tired.

1050
01:07:09,662 --> 01:07:13,373
I wanna go noddy-blinkums.

1051
01:07:13,374 --> 01:07:16,834
Whose bedroom
are we sleepin' in?

1052
01:07:16,835 --> 01:07:19,379
Actually, dear,
you're not staying here.

1053
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:23,383
We thought it would be more fun for you to
stay downtown at the Sunshine Inn.

1054
01:07:23,384 --> 01:07:26,678
No. What about
French toast and blintzes?

1055
01:07:26,679 --> 01:07:29,889
You don't want to
come back here for breakfast.

1056
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:33,851
Your bus leaves at 9: 17.

1057
01:07:33,852 --> 01:07:37,855
I thought we're staying
another day.

1058
01:07:37,856 --> 01:07:40,316
Grandpa and I
must have misunderstood.

1059
01:07:40,317 --> 01:07:43,903
See, we're, uh...
we're going out of town tomorrow.

1060
01:07:43,904 --> 01:07:46,864
The whole family
is going out of town.

1061
01:07:46,865 --> 01:07:51,868
I didn't know we were going anywhere.
[Grandma] be quiet.

1062
01:07:52,371 --> 01:07:55,414
That's all right.
Can we come?

1063
01:07:55,415 --> 01:07:59,877
No, Nancy,
you just can't.

1064
01:07:59,878 --> 01:08:04,882
- Well, will you at least drive us
to the motel? - Of course.

1065
01:08:04,883 --> 01:08:07,426
And we'll give you money for
a taxi for tomorrow morning.

1066
01:08:07,427 --> 01:08:09,387
You'll get to the bus
in plenty of time.

1067
01:08:09,388 --> 01:08:13,933
Here. Darling, it was lovely
to see you. Here.

1068
01:08:13,934 --> 01:08:17,394
Here, take it.
Sid.

1069
01:08:17,395 --> 01:08:20,397
What? I can't just
leave him there.

1070
01:08:20,398 --> 01:08:23,901
[Sid's voice]
These people, they're really lovely.

1071
01:08:23,902 --> 01:08:28,864
Best fuckin' food
I ever ate. [Tv, indistinct]

1072
01:08:28,865 --> 01:08:33,826
So why'd
they throw us out?

1073
01:08:37,874 --> 01:08:42,877
'Cause they know me.

1074
01:08:46,841 --> 01:08:53,345
[Kiss]
[Sirens blaring]

1075
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:09,361
Can you move your foot?

1076
01:09:23,378 --> 01:09:27,339
Know about the golden triangle?
Yeah.

1077
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:31,343
That's where
the heroin comes from.

1078
01:09:31,344 --> 01:09:34,387
Heard about it
when I was in the 'nam.

1079
01:09:34,388 --> 01:09:37,432
You heard of vietnam, right?
Yup.

1080
01:09:37,433 --> 01:09:39,392
Yeah, uh-huh.

1081
01:09:39,393 --> 01:09:42,437
Yeah, and while us guys
was fightin', dyin'...

1082
01:09:42,438 --> 01:09:44,898
and gettin' all fucked up,

1083
01:09:44,899 --> 01:09:48,443
the CIA was flyin' the shit
out of there and into here...

1084
01:09:48,444 --> 01:09:52,405
with our planes.

1085
01:09:52,406 --> 01:09:55,909
You know who
paid for that shit?

1086
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:58,411
We did.

1087
01:09:58,412 --> 01:10:01,873
That is, the government.

1088
01:10:01,874 --> 01:10:04,375
You know why?

1089
01:10:04,376 --> 01:10:10,338
'Cause smack
is the great controller.

1090
01:10:12,384 --> 01:10:14,427
Keeps the people stupid...

1091
01:10:14,428 --> 01:10:17,889
when they could be smart.

1092
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:22,352
What's he on about?
Some bullshit politics.

1093
01:10:22,353 --> 01:10:25,355
You guys got no right
to be strung out on that stuff.

1094
01:10:25,356 --> 01:10:28,858
You could be selling
healthy anarchy.

1095
01:10:28,859 --> 01:10:31,402
But long as you're addicts,

1096
01:10:31,403 --> 01:10:36,322
you'll be full of shit.

1097
01:10:50,255 --> 01:10:52,131
[Woman]
Come on, Vito. Don't be such a jerk.

1098
01:10:52,132 --> 01:10:55,593
I just don't know how many people want
to see Vicious on his own.

1099
01:10:55,594 --> 01:10:59,639
Are you kidding? Sid Vicious is a major...
he's not gonna be on his own.

1100
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:03,643
He's gonna have a great fuckin'
backup band behind him. Yeah. Yeah?

1101
01:11:03,644 --> 01:11:07,647
Who? "Who?"
Iggy, Dee Dee, Chrissie, Debbie.

1102
01:11:07,648 --> 01:11:10,107
Debbie harry singing backup.

1103
01:11:10,108 --> 01:11:13,611
It's true!
Johnny  Thunders, Joe Strummer...

1104
01:11:13,612 --> 01:11:17,114
I love you, Nancy. You're a fuckin' nutcase.
Stiv Bators, Jerry nolan.

1105
01:11:17,115 --> 01:11:20,576
I'm running a business here.
You really think he can pull this off?

1106
01:11:20,577 --> 01:11:22,536
Yes!
Can he play?

1107
01:11:22,537 --> 01:11:27,082
He can! Shit, he practices
all the time, right?

1108

It's not a band. It's a company.

1260
01:20:42,717 --> 01:20:45,678
Just little paper squares.

1261
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:48,681
Fuck.

1262
01:20:48,682 --> 01:20:52,726
Where are you going?
To get some more.

1263
01:20:52,727 --> 01:20:56,730
How do you facilitate
this communication, Johnny ?

1264
01:20:56,731 --> 01:21:00,234
By whatever we think
is relevant at the time.

1265
01:21:00,235 --> 01:21:02,736
And what is relevant
to you right now?

1266
01:21:02,737 --> 01:21:05,197
Not very much really,
Snydie.

1267
01:21:05,198 --> 01:21:08,200
Gretchen, girl.
What? Hey.

1268
01:21:08,201 --> 01:21:11,203
It's under that building.
That building?

1269
01:21:11,204 --> 01:21:16,208
[Children shouting]
[Man] Yeah? Fuck you, you asshole!

1270
01:21:16,209 --> 01:21:18,752
Where is it?
The money! Give us the money!

1271
01:21:18,753 --> 01:21:21,255
Where is the money?
Give us the money!

1272
01:21:21,256 --> 01:21:23,757
I want that money, kid.
I want it. Oi.

1273
01:21:23,758 --> 01:21:25,717
Cut it out.
Let him go.

1274
01:21:25,718 --> 01:21:29,263
He owes us three bucks, man!
I don't care. Leave him alone.

1275
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:35,726
Who the hell
do you think you are? Sid Vicious.

1276
01:21:36,729 --> 01:21:42,232
[Nancy]
Hey, that was good.

1277
01:21:45,238 --> 01:21:50,699
[Gunfire, horses neighing on TV]

1278
01:21:56,207 --> 01:22:01,209
When was the last time
we fucked?

1279
01:22:01,712 --> 01:22:06,214
I can't remember.

1280
01:22:07,218 --> 01:22:10,637
You miss it?

1281
01:22:10,638 --> 01:22:15,098
We can if you want to.

1282
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:18,561
No.

1283
01:22:18,562 --> 01:22:23,565
Just give me a kiss.

[Coughing continues]

1286
01:23:53,878 --> 01:23:59,381
Fuck. This is
fucking bullshit.

[Coughs]

1288
01:24:18,902 --> 01:24:24,405
[Chattering]

1289
01:24:26,410 --> 01:24:28,453
Fuck you, man.

1290
01:24:28,454 --> 01:24:32,872
Ow!
Bum.

1291
01:24:33,959 --> 01:24:35,960
Look at these guys, man.

1292

Alex. Hey, Nance.
What's going on?

1293
01:24:38,964 --> 01:24:41,007
Excuse me, man.
This is Sid Vicious here.

[Muttering]

1295
01:24:44,428 --> 01:24:49,430
Very nice. What do we have?
Put it in there.

1296
01:25:14,416 --> 01:25:17,418
Give me that. Yeah.

1297
01:25:17,419 --> 01:25:19,420
It's none
of my business, man,

1298
01:25:19,421 --> 01:25:23,966
but I don't know why
you hang with this chick.

1299
01:25:23,967 --> 01:25:27,428
Fuckin' junk hog,
let's face it.

1300
01:25:27,429 --> 01:25:30,472
On top of that, she's always
getting down on you,

1301
01:25:30,473 --> 01:25:32,474
bitchin' at you,
complaining.

1302
01:25:32,475 --> 01:25:34,435
Shit, man.

1303
01:25:34,436 --> 01:25:37,479
She's all right.
She don't mean it.

1304
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:40,441
She ought to have
more respect for you.

1305
01:25:40,442 --> 01:25:45,988
If I had a girlfriend, she'd show me
some respect. Believe it.

1306
01:25:45,989 --> 01:25:49,449
What are you talkin' about,
respect? You don't know her.

1307
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:53,495
She's gotten me these gigs at Max's.
We're both gettin' off the "h."

Is it my turn?

01:25:59,919 --> 01:26:03,505
Yeah, maybe.

Did I leave a lot of money
around here?

I thought I might have left it here.

1317

Mmm?

1318
01:26:31,033 --> 01:26:35,036
Can I have a little bit
of this for later?

1319
01:26:35,037 --> 01:26:40,499
All right, Sid?
Just that much.

Do you have any idea who
has stayed here before you?

1324
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:44,581
Dylan Thomas.
Excuse me. Watch the cat.

1325
01:28:44,582 --> 01:28:47,584
Thomas Wolfe.
Arthur Miller. Tennessee Williams.

1326
01:28:47,585 --> 01:28:50,629
This is not a place where
people set fire to their rooms.

1327

I want shopping!
The Chelsea Hotel is a landmark.

It's a historic part of the
city of New York. I want shopping!

Do you know who has stayed here before?
I want shopping!

This is a historic landmark.

I want shopping!
Shopping!

I'm putting you in room 100.
It's on the first floor.

1333
01:29:09,065 --> 01:29:11,566
You won't even have to
wait for the elevator. You'll like it.

Look at that.
The door's open. [Chuckling]

Where are you going
with that lamp? This is our lamp.

1337

You cannot move furniture
from room to room.

1338
01:29:21,577 --> 01:29:25,163
I forget where the fixtures are.
This is our lamp. We bought it.

1339
01:29:25,164 --> 01:29:29,584
Where's the tv?
There's no tv?

1340

There's no tv!

1341
01:29:32,088 --> 01:29:37,092
Would you do me a favor? Go up to your
old room, take the television, bring it down.

1342
01:29:37,093 --> 01:29:42,554
He wants you
to like this room.

1343
01:29:47,103 --> 01:29:52,606
Bob Dylan was born here.

1344
01:29:56,112 --> 01:29:59,614
I haven't got anything.
Just my wake-up shot.

1345
01:29:59,615 --> 01:30:03,118
Nobody's holding downtown.

1346
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:06,579
Bowery said he'd
meet us here.

1347

Are you still
buying off bowery?

1348
01:30:09,124 --> 01:30:12,168
I heard he sold someone a paper
and, like, died.

1349
01:30:12,169 --> 01:30:16,130
That's fucking bullshit.

Are you guys
still fighting, Nance?

1351
01:30:18,634 --> 01:30:21,135
He's real depressed.

1352
01:30:21,136 --> 01:30:25,139
Yeah. Jimmy's
real depressed too.

We're being so stupid.
We should just leave 'em.

Yeah, sure. Love kills.

Hey, man. How are you doing?

1359
01:30:42,074 --> 01:30:45,076
Got any beer for me?
I got some tickets to see Bruce Springsteen.

1360
01:30:45,077 --> 01:30:47,620
Fuck your tickets for fucking
Bruce Springsteen!  Man!

1361
01:30:47,621 --> 01:30:49,580
Fuck off
and get me some smack.

Just for that,
you ain't goin'! Sid.

Sid, look at these.

1365
01:30:56,088 --> 01:30:58,547
We need these.

1366
01:30:58,548 --> 01:31:03,552
But I don't have any money.

I can't remember.

You did it without me.
Oh, come on.

1370
01:31:11,103 --> 01:31:14,563
If I had only enough
for one of us, I'd give it all to you.

I wish I was fuckin' dead.

Oh, shut up, please.
Quit goin' on about it. [Sniffling]

1381
01:31:50,058 --> 01:31:52,601
I've got more reasons
to be depressed than you.

1382
01:31:52,602 --> 01:31:57,064
You're much better off
than I am.

1383
01:31:57,065 --> 01:31:59,107
Why?

1384
01:31:59,108 --> 01:32:04,571
At least youused
to be something.

1385
01:32:04,572 --> 01:32:08,575
I've never been anything.

Is that bowery?

1389
01:32:26,636 --> 01:32:30,639
No.
It's that Dwarf.

1390
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,682
He's not a Dwarf, Sid.

1391
01:32:32,683 --> 01:32:34,643
He's a little boy.

1392
01:32:34,644 --> 01:32:37,687
What would you know?
Little kids don't dress like that.

I'm sorry.

What've you got? Not much.

but nobody's holding.

straight, you shithole!

I don't need to hear your fucking crap!
Give us what you've got or piss off!

1414
01:33:51,637 --> 01:33:53,971
Hey, all right.
Easy, easy. Fucking books!

1415
01:33:53,972 --> 01:33:56,641
You wanna know what I got?
Hold on. Yeah.

1416
01:33:56,642 --> 01:33:59,185
Here we go. Something for you.
You fucking toad!

1417
01:33:59,186 --> 01:34:01,646
Don't get up.
I was just leaving. Wait!

1418
01:34:01,647 --> 01:34:04,190
Fuck you, Nancy!

1419
01:34:04,191 --> 01:34:06,192
You people are rude!

1420
01:34:06,193 --> 01:34:10,655
[Nancy]
I'm sorry. What's that?

1421
01:34:10,656 --> 01:34:15,158
I'm sorry.

1422
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:17,661
Better.

1423
01:34:17,662 --> 01:34:23,666
You two gotta watch your step, you know.
The buzz is out on you.

1424
01:34:25,170 --> 01:34:27,213
What's this?
Tuinals?

1425
01:34:27,214 --> 01:34:29,715
Yeah, what's this?
Speed.

1426
01:34:29,716 --> 01:34:31,717
Sulfate? You want some of this?
You want this?

1427
01:34:31,718 --> 01:34:37,638
Yeah. I never touch that stuff.
I'm too paranoid.

1428
01:34:41,186 --> 01:34:43,187
You guys are outside, man.

1429
01:34:43,188 --> 01:34:45,689
You shoot that stuff,
it's gonna make you sick.

1430
01:34:45,690 --> 01:34:49,693
What about the dilaudid?
Tried. I couldn't get ahold of the guy.

1431
01:34:49,694 --> 01:34:51,695
You got a phone?
I'll try again.

1432
01:34:51,696 --> 01:34:54,031
Yeah.
It's in the lobby.

1433
01:34:54,032 --> 01:34:56,241
The phone is in the lobby.

1434
01:34:56,242 --> 01:34:59,244
Right.
[Sighs]

1435
01:34:59,245 --> 01:35:01,663
No promises.

1436
01:35:01,664 --> 01:35:05,250
But for
my famous friends...

1437
01:35:05,251 --> 01:35:09,671
I go the extra mile.

1438
01:35:09,672 --> 01:35:13,175
You guys aren't going anywhere, are you?
[Chuckles]

1439
01:35:13,176 --> 01:35:18,679
[Tv, indistinct]

1440
01:35:27,732 --> 01:35:30,734
My eyes hurt.

1441
01:35:30,735 --> 01:35:36,697
The TV's so bright
it hurts my eyes.

1442
01:35:40,703 --> 01:35:45,205
[Amplifier off]

1443
01:35:47,251 --> 01:35:51,753
Oh, fuck it.

1444
01:36:03,726 --> 01:36:11,147
Just broke, sort of blinking
at them, you know.

1445
01:36:12,943 --> 01:36:15,528
A dolly, I suppose.
It's something I can't remember.

1446
01:36:15,529 --> 01:36:18,865
Shut up.

1447
01:36:18,866 --> 01:36:23,368
Listen.

1448
01:36:38,093 --> 01:36:41,929
What?

1449
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:46,809
I can't hear nothing.
No.

1450
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:51,271
Listen to me.

1451
01:36:52,649 --> 01:36:56,068
I don't want to.

1452
01:36:56,069 --> 01:37:00,571
Why not?

1453
01:37:02,075 --> 01:37:06,537
I don't know.
I just don't.

1454
01:37:06,538 --> 01:37:11,499
What are you
waiting for?

1455
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:20,509
Bowery?

1456
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:26,013
[Chuckles]
Bowery doesn't fucking matter.

1457
01:37:30,479 --> 01:37:34,981
What does?

1458
01:37:36,485 --> 01:37:40,986
You.

1459
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:46,992
And?

1460
01:37:49,956 --> 01:37:54,458
You.

1461
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,172
[Sid]
I'm just not going to, okay?

1462
01:37:58,173 --> 01:38:00,466
[Nancy]
You have to. You promised.

1463
01:38:00,467 --> 01:38:02,885
Yeah, well,
I changed me mind.

1464
01:38:02,886 --> 01:38:05,429
You can't!
You can't change your mind.

1465
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:08,891
We said we'd go out together. You
can't change your mind. Of course I can.

1466
01:38:08,892 --> 01:38:11,393
I just did. I did.
No!

1467
01:38:11,394 --> 01:38:13,937
Blaze of glory!

1468
01:38:13,938 --> 01:38:16,940
You promised!
You promised!

1469
01:38:16,941 --> 01:38:20,944
I'm getting out of this place.
I'm going back to England. No! Why?

1470
01:38:20,945 --> 01:38:22,905
'Cause I wanna get straight,
you know?

1471
01:38:22,906 --> 01:38:26,408
I'm sick and tired of all these
fucking people that kiss ass! Fuck you!

1472
01:38:26,409 --> 01:38:29,411
I want to get back with my friends
and people who care. Okay. Okay.

1473
01:38:29,412 --> 01:38:32,372
Go on!
Just leave me!

1474
01:38:32,373 --> 01:38:35,208
You're always putting fucking words
in my mouth! Friends?

1475
01:38:35,209 --> 01:38:37,961
They don't even care about you!
I am fucking leaving!

1476
01:38:37,962 --> 01:38:40,380
I'm your best friend, Sid.

1477
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:44,926
So you keep fucking telling me!
And you'll never get straight.

1478
01:38:44,927 --> 01:38:47,471
You'll never
get straight, Sid.

1479
01:38:47,472 --> 01:38:50,432
You say that
every fucking day.

1480
01:38:50,433 --> 01:38:52,434
It's the same.

1481
01:38:52,435 --> 01:38:56,938
I can't get up tomorrow
to the same thing.

1482
01:38:56,939 --> 01:38:59,482
I can't do it anymore.

1483
01:38:59,483 --> 01:39:01,985
Oh, god, please help me.

1484
01:39:01,986 --> 01:39:04,904
Please, you promised.

1485
01:39:04,905 --> 01:39:07,949
You're so full of shit.
You're so fuckin' blind!

1486
01:39:07,950 --> 01:39:10,952
No, I'm not.
I'm not blind.

1487
01:39:10,953 --> 01:39:13,413
I see everything.

1488
01:39:13,414 --> 01:39:16,958
Where are you going?
No! Going out for...

1489
01:39:16,959 --> 01:39:21,463
no, it's 5:00 in the morning. There's
nothing out there! Get out of my fucking way!

1490

Fuck you, sid.
You're so stupid!

1491
01:39:23,966 --> 01:39:28,011
Get out of the fucking way!
You're so fucking weak!

1492
01:39:28,012 --> 01:39:32,015
Help me! Please, you're
so fucking weak and stupid.

1493
01:39:32,016 --> 01:39:34,726
Help me. Help me.

Fuck off! Fuck off!

Fucking hell!
Will you get off?

1496
01:39:40,691 --> 01:39:43,609
- You wanna fucking die?
- Yeah!

1497
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:46,487

[No audio]
I gotta take off.

01:42:41,704 --> 01:42:47,665
It's a bad scene.
Whoa. [Departing footsteps]

1517
01:42:54,174 --> 01:42:58,676
Who called 911?

1518
01:42:59,722 --> 01:43:04,223
Did you call 911?

- Sid Vicious, can I have a picture?
- Fuck off!

Why'd you do it?
Get the punker!

1523
01:43:21,243 --> 01:43:23,703

Did you do it?

Look, kid, you're out on bail, right?

1532
01:44:03,243 --> 01:44:05,661
One safety pin.
Why don't you give yourself a break?

1533
01:44:05,662 --> 01:44:10,666
One stick of gum. I know you think
you're kinda tough, Ritchie.

1534
01:44:10,667 --> 01:44:14,253
There's a lot of guys out there
a lot tougher. One leather-studded arm band.

I don't see any braces
on your legs.

Sure, kid.
What is it?

1542

Where can I
get a pizza?

Yo, Sid, you want
to dance with us?

01:46:16,458 --> 01:46:18,709
I don't dance
with no little kids.

1561

thinking you were the king

1570
01:48:13,824 --> 01:48:18,245
taking on this world

1571
01:48:18,246 --> 01:48:20,246
on that bus that goes
through Mexico

1572
01:48:20,247 --> 01:48:22,248
where killer love finds

1573
01:48:22,249 --> 01:48:26,044
a sweet Mexican girl

1574
01:48:26,045 --> 01:48:28,421
but in Mississippi

1575
01:48:28,422 --> 01:48:30,465
we rushed into the room

1576
01:48:30,466 --> 01:48:34,926
[shouts]

1577
01:48:34,970 --> 01:48:36,429
Down in dixie

1578
01:48:36,430 --> 01:48:40,932
you were cryin' for dope

1579
01:48:42,937 --> 01:48:44,395
down in Alabama

1580
01:48:44,396 --> 01:48:46,981
they like home-cooked fare

1581
01:48:46,982 --> 01:48:50,902

1582
01:48:50,903 --> 01:48:54,864

to the fryin' chair

1583
01:48:54,865 --> 01:48:58,785
yeah

1584
01:48:58,786 --> 01:49:01,037
but I don't know

1585
01:49:01,038 --> 01:49:03,289
what love is

1586
01:49:03,290 --> 01:49:05,041
is there something else

1587
01:49:05,042 --> 01:49:07,293
giving me the chills

1588
01:49:07,294 --> 01:49:08,795
but if my hands

1589
01:49:08,796 --> 01:49:11,255
are the color of blood

1590
01:49:11,256 --> 01:49:14,842
then I can tell
sure I can tell ya

1591
01:49:14,843 --> 01:49:18,846
love kills

1592
01:49:18,847 --> 01:49:22,850

1593
01:49:22,851 --> 01:49:27,104

01:49:27,105 --> 01:49:33,776
love kills

1595
01:49:38,784 --> 01:49:41,369
do you want
to hear the sirens

1596
01:49:41,370 --> 01:49:43,329
all sirens in the city

1597
01:49:43,330 --> 01:49:47,792
drown out arguing

1598
01:49:47,793 --> 01:49:51,337
we were Riker's Island
on a population board

1599
01:49:51,338 --> 01:49:55,341
they don't care
about your fame

1600
01:49:55,342 --> 01:49:57,593
but I don't know

1601
01:49:57,594 --> 01:49:59,803
what love is

1602
01:49:59,804 --> 01:50:01,805
is there something else

1603
01:50:01,806 --> 01:50:03,807
giving me the chills

1604
01:50:03,808 --> 01:50:05,851
but if my hands

1605
01:50:05,852 --> 01:50:07,811

1606
01:50:07,812 --> 01:50:11,315
then I can tell ya

1607
01:50:11,316 --> 01:50:15,653

1608
01:50:15,654 --> 01:50:19,782

1613
01:50:35,381 --> 01:50:41,301
[continues]

1614
01:52:03,886 --> 01:52:05,345
On the rio grande

1615
01:52:05,346 --> 01:52:07,930
people tie you to a tree

1616
01:52:07,931 --> 01:52:09,682
ohh-oh-ohh

1617
01:52:09,683 --> 01:52:11,351
ohh-oh-ohh

1618
01:52:11,352 --> 01:52:13,686
and you can't
call the lawyers

1619
01:52:13,687 --> 01:52:15,938
'cause the whorehouse
is asleep

1620
01:52:15,939 --> 01:52:17,940
ohh-oh-ohh

1621
01:52:17,941 --> 01:52:19,901
ohh-oh-ohh

1622
01:52:19,902 --> 01:52:23,905
people end up weak

1623
01:52:23,906 --> 01:52:26,365
ohh-oh-ohh

1624
01:52:26,366 --> 01:52:27,909
ohh-oh-ohh

1625
01:52:27,910 --> 01:52:29,911
they'll throw you in a cell?

1626
01:52:29,912 --> 01:52:32,455
Where you can barely breathe

1627
01:52:32,456 --> 01:52:34,207
ohh-oh-ohh

1628
01:52:34,208 --> 01:52:35,875
ohh-oh-ohh

1629
01:52:35,876 --> 01:52:38,210
but I don't know

1630
01:52:38,211 --> 01:52:40,421
what love is

1631
01:52:40,422 --> 01:52:42,214
is there something else

1632
01:52:42,215 --> 01:52:44,425
giving me the chills

then I can tell ya
sure I can tell ya

1636
01:52:51,933 --> 01:52:55,936
