Why I married Nick.

182
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:52,198
My answer is that Nick came along
at the right time and with a wedding ring.

The ring was the first thing
he mentioned.

And you liked it
for certain reasons.

Sure. By the time Nick came along...

is still running.

00:43:01,128 --> 00:43:02,712
We were looking at her.

460
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,590
She must have walked off
right onto the bare wire.

461

Boy, those fuses blew out
like a cannon!

- Yeah.

463
00:43:12,264 --> 00:43:16,393
- They don't know a thing about electricity.
- Killed her deader than a doornail.

464
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,104
Yes, the cat's dead, all right.

465
00:43:19,313 --> 00:43:23,400
Well, accidents can happen
in the weirdest sort of ways.

466
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,360
So long, laddie.

467
00:43:26,153 --> 00:43:28,530
I never saw a prettier cat.

468
00:43:29,281 --> 00:43:31,616
Killed her deader than a doornail.

- Oh, Frank.
- Easy, Cora. Easy.

470
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:51,553
- It was all my fault.
- Mine too.

471
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,013
No, it was all my fault.

472
00:43:54,181 --> 00:43:58,518
I was the one that thought it up,
but you didn't want to.

473
00:43:58,686 --> 00:44:03,189
- But next time I'll listen to you.
- Except there won't be any next time.

474
00:44:03,357 --> 00:44:06,025
- Oh, never. Never.
- Listen, baby.

If Nick should die, they'll know.

476
00:44:09,905 --> 00:44:13,616
They always find out.
They guess it right just from habit.

477
00:44:14,076 --> 00:44:18,079
I guess I'm not any braver
than I thought I was...

478
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:21,124
...or else I wouldn't have been so scared.

479
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:23,710
I'm plenty scared too.

480
00:44:24,044 --> 00:44:26,546
When all the lights went out...

481
00:44:26,714 --> 00:44:28,756
...I was just a little girl again...

482
00:44:28,924 --> 00:44:31,092
...afraid of the dark.

483
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,053
But from now on you'll be
the brains of this outfit...

484
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:36,431
...and I'll work so hard for this place.

We can't make any plans
until we find out about Nick.

He's all right. They wanna keep
him for a week, but he'll be okay.

- Now we can breathe again for a minute.
- Just think.

499
00:45:27,107 --> 00:45:30,235
A week. A whole week
to work things out.

500
00:45:30,402 --> 00:45:34,614
You give me a big kiss
before I sock you.

You know, it's after 7:00. We've got
to get this place going for business.

FRANK: That was the happiest week
I'd ever spent in my life.

503
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,292
I wouldn't let myself think.

504
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:50,296
And Cora wouldn't even discuss what
was gonna happen when Nick came home.

505
00:45:50,464 --> 00:45:52,882
All I cared about was her being happy.

506
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:57,637
And as for me,
I felt as if I was riding on a cloud.

507
00:45:59,348 --> 00:46:01,975
Look at that, a battery
and a whole set of plugs.

508

I'll say everything's fine around here.
One sale.

Will Mrs. Smith be tickled pink! Say, how
about a nice cold drink on the house?

510
00:46:10,526 --> 00:46:12,819
No. Nope, I've got to hurry.

511
00:46:13,112 --> 00:46:15,572
- So your boss is coming home?
- Any day now.

512
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:19,075
Today, you mean. Sure, I just passed
the car coming from town.

513
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,452
That gorgeous blond
was driving careful...

514
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,997
...and the old boy has a bandage
on his head.

515
00:46:24,164 --> 00:46:26,499
Oh, that poor little pussycat.

516
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:30,587
- Sure killed her.
- Yep. Deader than a doornail, remember?

517
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:32,463
Yeah.

518
00:46:39,722 --> 00:46:43,141
FRANK: It was for her sake as well
as mine that I knew I had to move on.

519
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:45,810
If I waited for them,
I couldn't convince her...

520
00:46:45,978 --> 00:46:48,271
...to give up the place
and go away with me.

521
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:52,025
And if I stayed there,
I could see where she and I were headed.

522
00:46:52,901 --> 00:46:55,403
But after a couple weeks in L.A...

523
00:46:55,571 --> 00:46:58,573
...I sunk low enough to hang around
a wholesale market...

524
00:46:58,741 --> 00:47:03,828
...where they bought a lot of their stuff,
hoping I'd run into her.

It kept nagging me all the time.

made up. Without even talking to me...

...your mind's made up. Well, mine isn't!

get him to take out a policy.

763
01:05:50,037 --> 01:05:52,497
I left before Nick came home
from the hospital.

764
01:05:52,665 --> 01:05:56,376
And two days after you came back,
he got killed.

765
01:05:56,544 --> 01:05:58,587
You were in touch
with her by phone.

766
01:05:58,755 --> 01:06:04,468
And the day after the policy was granted,
you ran into Nick and what do you think?

767
01:06:04,635 --> 01:06:06,970
She'd fixed up this Santa Barbara trip.

768
01:06:07,138 --> 01:06:09,681
And for old time's sakes,
you had to go along.

769
01:06:09,849 --> 01:06:14,060
Then she had to see Malibu Lake.
Wasn't that an idea, now?

770
01:06:14,353 --> 01:06:17,147
- Would you like to pick it up from there?
- No. No!

771
01:06:17,315 --> 01:06:20,525
Well, it was all planned.
You crowned him from behind...

772
01:06:20,693 --> 01:06:23,528
...then she slid out
and started the car.

773
01:06:23,696 --> 01:06:27,991
Then it was your turn to climb out, so you
could both claim you'd escaped in time.

774
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:30,410
She moved too quick,
you couldn't make it.

775
01:06:30,578 --> 01:06:33,872
- She jumped, you went over the cliff.
- That isn't what happened!

776
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,749
How do you know?
You were drunk.

777
01:06:35,917 --> 01:06:38,710
- I mean, I don't think that's--
- You were drunk!

778
01:06:38,878 --> 01:06:40,504
You don't know what happened.

779
01:06:40,671 --> 01:06:43,256
- I....
- Wait a minute.

780
01:06:45,009 --> 01:06:48,428
Maybe you didn't have
anything to do with it.

781
01:06:48,638 --> 01:06:50,388
Maybe she did it.

782
01:06:50,556 --> 01:06:52,307
Listen, laddie, she did do it.

783
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:55,435
There were three people in that car,
Nick, you and Cora.

784
01:06:55,603 --> 01:06:57,395
It's a cinch Nick didn't do it.

785
01:06:57,563 --> 01:07:00,065
So if you were too drunk,
that leaves her.

786
01:07:00,233 --> 01:07:01,942
- Who says anybody did it?
- I do.

787
01:07:02,109 --> 01:07:05,111
If you told the truth,
you didn't have interest in her...

788
01:07:05,279 --> 01:07:08,323
...except as the wife of your boss,
then you gotta do something.

789
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:11,326
I-- Do something? I don't follow you--

790
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:14,371
You've got to sign a complaint
against her!

791
01:07:14,747 --> 01:07:15,789
A complaint?

792
01:07:15,957 --> 01:07:20,919
If you were in that car, drunk and helpless,
then she tried to kill you too.

793
01:07:21,087 --> 01:07:23,046
You've got to do something about that.

794
01:07:23,214 --> 01:07:25,549
Because it'll look pretty funny
if you didn't.

795
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,843
She couldn't have meant to kill me.

796
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:31,346
You were drunk, you couldn't know
what was going on, could you?

797
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:34,599
- Uh, I guess not.
- Then it was Cora who crowned Nick.

798
01:07:34,767 --> 01:07:38,103
Then she slid out and sent the car
over the cliff.

799
01:07:38,271 --> 01:07:40,647
- You saying it don't make it so.
- Yes, it does.

800
01:07:40,815 --> 01:07:43,358
When I drove around,
that car was turning over...

801
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:46,027
...but she was already
on the road, yelling.

802
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:49,489
She felt the car going over,
so she jumped.

803
01:07:49,782 --> 01:07:53,994
She jumps out of a car turning over
and has time to pick up her handbag.

804
01:07:54,161 --> 01:07:58,707
Because I can testify she had that white,
beaded bag when she ran up screaming.

805
01:07:58,875 --> 01:08:02,460
Oh, no. Cora wasn't in that car
when it went over, but you were.

806
01:08:02,628 --> 01:08:04,880
You were still in it
when I climbed down.

807
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:09,968
It wasn't nervousness on Cora's part that
sent that car over with you and Nick in it.

808
01:08:10,136 --> 01:08:14,014
She wanted that sweet property
and insurance money all to herself...

809
01:08:14,181 --> 01:08:15,974
...instead of sharing it with you.

810
01:08:16,142 --> 01:08:19,144
- Now, are you gonna sign this complaint?
- No.

811
01:08:19,312 --> 01:08:21,313
- You got it mixed up.
- It's you or her.

812

to do with it, sign this.

Anyway, we didn't do it
for that reason at all.

912
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:20,333
That's it.

913
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:29,217
All right. Sign here.

914
01:17:30,279 --> 01:17:31,737
[DOOR OPENING]

915
01:17:38,245 --> 01:17:42,540
I'll put you out of business.
There must be a law, even for lawyers.

916
01:17:42,708 --> 01:17:46,878
You know the district attorney fooled
you into that confession, don't you?

917
01:17:47,045 --> 01:17:49,046
And you fell for it, both of you.

918
01:17:53,385 --> 01:17:55,344
He got you working
against each other.

919
01:17:55,512 --> 01:17:58,222
- Don't you see?
- You bet I see.

920
01:17:58,390 --> 01:18:01,017
He got nothing from me,
so he started in on you.

921
01:18:01,185 --> 01:18:03,811
- And right away you turned yellow.
KEATS: Yellow?

922
01:18:05,856 --> 01:18:08,524
Yellow is a color you figure on
in a murder.

923
01:18:08,901 --> 01:18:13,154
And nobody figures it better than
Kyle Sackett. That was his trump card.

924
01:18:13,322 --> 01:18:15,907
Once he tricked you into
signing that complaint...

925
01:18:16,074 --> 01:18:20,036
...he knew no power on earth could
keep you from turning on him.

926
01:18:20,204 --> 01:18:21,621
That way, he gets you both.

927
01:18:21,788 --> 01:18:25,416
If you knew all that, why didn't
you stop me from confessing?

928
01:18:25,584 --> 01:18:26,751
Oh, I tried.

929
01:18:26,919 --> 01:18:30,129
I tried, but nobody
could have stopped you.

930
01:18:30,297 --> 01:18:33,466
However, now that you've
got it off your chest....

931
01:18:33,884 --> 01:18:36,093
- Kennedy.
MAN: Yes, sir?

932
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:43,434
That confession Mrs. Smith signed,
what did you do with it?

933
01:18:43,602 --> 01:18:47,563
I gave it to Jimmy White to lock
up in your safe, like you told me to.

934
01:18:49,233 --> 01:18:50,733
That's all.

935
01:18:53,904 --> 01:18:56,113
You mean he's not from
the DA's office?

936
01:18:56,281 --> 01:18:58,282
A plainclothes dick
if I ever saw one.

937
01:18:58,450 --> 01:19:01,410
He used to be a dick.
But he's not a dick anymore.

938
01:19:01,578 --> 01:19:03,913
He works for me now.
He's my gumshoe man.

939
01:19:04,122 --> 01:19:09,544
With the DA using high-pressure tactics,
I had to fight fire with fire.

940
01:19:10,212 --> 01:19:14,632
Since you were due to spill the beans,
better to do it to my man, not Sackett's.

941
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,468
- Why, you--
- That's why I said we'd plead guilty.

942
01:19:17,636 --> 01:19:21,556
To stop everything cold in that courtroom
before you blew your topper.

943
01:19:21,723 --> 01:19:25,226
- Then the DA's got nothing against me.
- You're not even under arrest.

944
01:19:25,394 --> 01:19:27,436
Oh, sure. He goes free,
and I get tossed in...

945
01:19:27,604 --> 01:19:29,647
- ...for murder and attempt!
- Unless....

946
01:19:29,815 --> 01:19:33,067
- Unless you let me handle it.
- Ha!

947
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,238
Listen, my girl...

948
01:19:37,406 --> 01:19:38,948
...you're still in trouble.

949
01:19:39,116 --> 01:19:42,618
Because we don't know what evidence
Sackett's got against us.

950
01:19:42,786 --> 01:19:44,912
From now on,
speak only when spoken to.

951
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:49,458
And in that court tomorrow, try and look
as young and innocent as possible.

952
01:19:49,626 --> 01:19:51,961
And remember,
I'm the only hope you've got.

953
01:19:53,505 --> 01:19:55,631
Time's up, young lady.

954
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:03,306
Cora Smith.

955
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:05,474
Is that your true name?

956
01:20:05,642 --> 01:20:06,684
Yes.

957
01:20:06,852 --> 01:20:11,856
Cora Smith, you're charged in
information number 19-X5-27 in the...

958
01:20:12,024 --> 01:20:14,400
...Superior Court of California
on two counts.

959
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:17,820
Count one, murder of Nicholas Smith.

960
01:20:17,988 --> 01:20:20,573
Count two, attempted murder
of Frank Chambers.

961
01:20:20,741 --> 01:20:22,992
Your Honor, we waive further reading.

962
01:20:23,785 --> 01:20:26,537
- Very well.
- Are you ready to plead?

963
01:20:26,705 --> 01:20:28,289
KEATS:
We are.

964
01:20:28,457 --> 01:20:33,085
To count one, murder of Nicholas Smith,
how do you plead, guilty or not guilty?

965
01:20:34,004 --> 01:20:35,713
- Not guilty.
- What?

966
01:20:40,636 --> 01:20:42,011
If Your Honor please...

967
01:20:42,179 --> 01:20:45,097
...my client protested her innocence
from the beginning.

968
01:20:45,265 --> 01:20:46,641
I didn't believe her.

969
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:51,395
In her best interest, I urged her to plead
guilty and ask for the court's mercy.

970
01:20:51,563 --> 01:20:53,189
But with later developments...

971
01:20:53,357 --> 01:20:58,361
...no other course is open to me
but to plead not guilty to both charges.

972
01:21:02,658 --> 01:21:07,370
Will the district attorney consent to a brief
conference, with the court's permission?

973
01:21:16,254 --> 01:21:17,755
Kyle...

974
01:21:17,923 --> 01:21:19,757
...you're bluffing.

975
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:23,803
You gambled on getting a confession,
and you didn't get it.

976
01:21:24,262 --> 01:21:27,264
I know you haven't got one iota
of evidence against her...

977
01:21:27,432 --> 01:21:31,727
...and without witnesses, you'll never
prove it couldn't have been an accident.

978
01:21:33,939 --> 01:21:37,108
Dismiss that phony attempt charge...

979
01:21:37,275 --> 01:21:40,778
...change murder to manslaughter,
and we'll plead guilty...

980
01:21:40,946 --> 01:21:45,032
...providing you give a recommendation
for leniency.

981
01:21:54,418 --> 01:21:55,876
SACKETT:
If Your Honor please...

982
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:59,255
...I move to dismiss the charge
of attempted murder...

983
01:21:59,589 --> 01:22:02,633
...and to permit her to withdraw
her plea of not guilty...

984
01:22:02,801 --> 01:22:05,469
...for the purpose of
entering a new plea.

985
01:22:07,806 --> 01:22:08,889
Motion granted.

986
01:22:09,307 --> 01:22:11,600
I'm informed by defendant's counsel...

987
01:22:11,768 --> 01:22:15,688
...that she will enter a plea of guilty
to the charge of manslaughter.

988
01:22:15,856 --> 01:22:20,276
I feel this plea will be satisfactory to
the people and in the interest of justice.

989
01:22:20,444 --> 01:22:22,319
That's correct, Your Honor.

990
01:22:23,196 --> 01:22:24,405
Very well.

991
01:22:25,323 --> 01:22:29,660
Cora Smith, to the crime of manslaughter,
how do you plead?

992
01:22:32,831 --> 01:22:34,248
Guilty.

993
01:22:44,342 --> 01:22:45,634
Guilty.

994
01:22:51,224 --> 01:22:55,227
Your Honor, we waive time for sentence.
We're ready for sentence now.

995
01:22:55,979 --> 01:23:00,024
It is the sentence of the law
and the judgment of this court...

996
01:23:00,192 --> 01:23:04,278
...that you be confined in the state
institution for women at Tehachapi...

997
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:06,530
...for the term prescribed by law.

998
01:23:06,698 --> 01:23:10,701
If Your Honor please, I recommend
leniency be granted this defendant.

999
01:23:13,872 --> 01:23:19,001
It seems to me that considerable leniency
has been given this defendant already.

1000
01:23:19,336 --> 01:23:23,547
May we approach the bench
and explain the facts to Your Honor?

1001
01:23:25,634 --> 01:23:26,675
Very well.

1002
01:23:39,022 --> 01:23:41,649
I am personally satisfied
of the defendant's guilt...

1003
01:23:41,817 --> 01:23:43,567
...beyond a reasonable doubt...

1004
01:23:43,735 --> 01:23:48,405
...but there are many practical and legal
difficulties in proving the case against her.

1005
01:23:48,573 --> 01:23:51,951
In these circumstances,
I deemed it wise to follow this course...

1006
01:23:52,118 --> 01:23:57,331
...thus saving the people of the state of
California the expense of a protracted trial.

1007
01:23:57,999 --> 01:24:00,125
Return to your places.

1008
01:24:07,259 --> 01:24:10,010
JUDGE: Having full confidence
in the district attorney...

1009
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:11,720
...I follow his recommendation.

1010
01:24:11,888 --> 01:24:14,306
The court summarily grants probation.

1011
01:24:14,474 --> 01:24:17,518
And suspends execution of the sentence.

1012
01:24:21,898 --> 01:24:23,607
That's it. You're free.

1013
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:29,613
It's all right, Mrs. Smith.
Everything's gonna be all right now.

1014
01:24:32,409 --> 01:24:34,785
That's what you think.

1015
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:42,209
That was a brilliant piece
of strategy, laddie.

1016
01:24:42,961 --> 01:24:44,128
Thank you, Kyle.

1017
01:24:44,296 --> 01:24:47,965
But you're crazy if you think I'm
through with those two murderers.

1018
01:24:50,135 --> 01:24:52,303
Well, that's the whole story.

1019
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:56,640
Except that if either one of you even
parks a car alongside a fire hydrant...

1020
01:24:56,808 --> 01:24:59,560
...Mr. Sackett will see
that you get 20 years.

1021
01:25:07,485 --> 01:25:10,738
Just a minute.
There's one other little matter.

1022
01:25:10,906 --> 01:25:12,448
Yes?

1023
01:25:14,451 --> 01:25:16,702
That insurance policy.

1024
01:25:16,995 --> 01:25:20,456
This 10,000 bucks you get
for knocking off your husband.

1025
01:25:20,665 --> 01:25:23,459
Oh, sure. That's how I knew
Sackett was bluffing.

1026
01:25:23,627 --> 01:25:27,212
If the company with the smartest
detectives couldn't find evidence...

1027
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:29,840
...it's a cinch the DA couldn't.

1028
01:25:30,258 --> 01:25:31,842
- I....
- Uh....

1029
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:36,347
In an exceptional case like this,
I ought to keep it all.

1030
01:25:38,725 --> 01:25:40,434
But this time...

1031
01:25:40,852 --> 01:25:42,728
...you take it.

1032
01:25:43,229 --> 01:25:47,983
I don't want that 10 grand.
Besides, I got 10 grand.

1033
01:25:48,777 --> 01:25:52,696
I've been trying to figure things out,
and I still don't know what to say.

1034
01:25:52,864 --> 01:25:56,533
Don't say thanks. You did me a favor.
Look what I got out of it:

1035
01:25:56,701 --> 01:26:00,037
I won 100 bucks from Sackett.
I made him write me a check.

1036
01:26:00,205 --> 01:26:02,498
I'm gonna frame it
and hang it over my desk.

1037
01:26:02,666 --> 01:26:04,833
- Let's get going, Kennedy.
KENNEDY: Back to town, Sammy.

1038
01:26:05,001 --> 01:26:06,585
Okay, boss.

1039
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:18,597
Well, goodbye, Mr. Yellow.

1040
01:26:18,765 --> 01:26:21,558
I don't know what you're going to do
and I don't care...

1041
01:26:21,726 --> 01:26:24,728
...but I'm going in
and open up my lunchroom.

1042
01:26:28,191 --> 01:26:31,110
Cora. Cora, look...

1043
01:26:31,277 --> 01:26:34,571
...maybe-- Maybe you
could sell the place and...

1044
01:26:34,739 --> 01:26:38,492
...we can go away somewhere and
start fresh, where nobody knows us.

1045
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:40,119
Oh, no.

1046
01:26:40,286 --> 01:26:43,080
You've tried to make me a tramp
since you've known me.

1047
01:26:43,248 --> 01:26:45,207
But you're not going to do it.

1048
01:26:45,375 --> 01:26:47,584
I stay here.

1049
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:50,004
All right.

1050
01:26:52,048 --> 01:26:54,258
I'm gonna stay too.

1051
01:26:56,177 --> 01:26:58,429
Let me tell you something.
If you do stay...

1052
01:26:58,596 --> 01:27:02,891
...there's going to be a lot of hard work,
because I've got ideas for this place.

1053
01:27:03,059 --> 01:27:05,477
I'm going to fix a nice spot
under the trees...

1054
01:27:05,645 --> 01:27:07,438
...then I'm going to sell beer--

1055
01:27:07,605 --> 01:27:12,484
- You're in the hamburger business--
- I'm going to amount to something!

1056
01:27:13,653 --> 01:27:16,447
So if you want to keep your job...

1057
01:27:16,614 --> 01:27:20,367
...you'll have this place clean and open
for business tomorrow at 7.

1058
01:27:20,535 --> 01:27:22,161
Okay.

1059
01:27:23,455 --> 01:27:26,165
Okay, Mrs. Smith.

1060
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:31,336
That expresses it perfectly.

they threw him in the can...

It's my wedding present to him.

it was a noose around his neck.

If you haven't got it, Sackett.

1210
01:36:54,859 --> 01:36:58,778
You know, Mr. Kennedy, it's really
too bad that Frank was here...

1211
01:36:58,946 --> 01:37:01,865
...because if we had been alone,
I feel...

1212
01:37:02,033 --> 01:37:05,285
...that I could've talked you out of it.

1213
01:37:14,295 --> 01:37:17,213
All right, snap out of it
and get your friends on the phone.

1214
01:37:17,381 --> 01:37:18,923
I got no friends.

1215
01:37:19,091 --> 01:37:21,635
I'm the only one that knows--

1216
01:37:23,262 --> 01:37:26,014
- You're gonna call your friends?
- I ain't got no friends.

1217
01:37:26,182 --> 01:37:28,224
I'm the only one that knows about it.

1218
01:37:28,392 --> 01:37:31,603
- You're gonna call your friends?
- I got no friends. I tell you--

1219
01:37:38,402 --> 01:37:39,861
Don't hit me no more!

1220
01:37:40,029 --> 01:37:43,573
- I tell you, I only got one friend.
- All right.

1221
01:37:43,741 --> 01:37:46,034
Get him on the phone.
Come on, in the kitchen.

1222
01:37:46,202 --> 01:37:48,495
KENNEDY:
All right! All right!

1223
01:37:48,663 --> 01:37:50,330
Here.

1224
01:37:51,248 --> 01:37:52,999
Thanks.

1225
01:37:55,252 --> 01:37:58,088
Cora, bring the extension phone,
will you?

1226
01:37:59,965 --> 01:38:03,176
There it is, Kennedy.
Make it a good story.

1227
01:38:04,178 --> 01:38:05,428
Here.

1228
01:38:05,596 --> 01:38:08,139
If he tries to pull a fast one,
I'll give you the sign.

1229
01:38:08,307 --> 01:38:09,766
Okay.

1230
01:38:09,934 --> 01:38:11,935
Come on.

1231
01:38:18,109 --> 01:38:19,651
Say--

1232
01:38:26,742 --> 01:38:28,618
Is that you, Willie?

1233
01:38:28,786 --> 01:38:31,955
This is me.
Listen, it's all fixed.

1234
01:38:32,123 --> 01:38:35,291
How soon can you get out here
with it? Yeah.

1235
01:38:35,459 --> 01:38:38,586
Yeah, Chambers is on his way
to the bank now to get the dough.

1236
01:38:38,754 --> 01:38:41,631
Willie, get this.
He knows we got him, see.

1237
01:38:41,799 --> 01:38:45,719
But he's afraid if she finds out he's gonna
pay all that dough, she won't let him.

1238
01:38:45,886 --> 01:38:47,345
You get it?

1239
01:38:50,182 --> 01:38:53,435
Well, maybe it sounds to you
like a funny way to do it, Willie...

1240
01:38:53,602 --> 01:38:55,812
...but I got my reasons.

1241
01:38:57,356 --> 01:38:59,315
Okay.

1242
01:39:01,318 --> 01:39:04,320
Willie's gonna bring the papers
out here.

1243
01:39:04,488 --> 01:39:06,573
He's awful suspicious.

1244
01:39:06,741 --> 01:39:09,159
Willie's a bad hombre
when he gets suspicious.

1245
01:39:09,326 --> 01:39:12,328
Yeah? Thanks.

1246
01:39:13,956 --> 01:39:17,250
That's so you'll act right
when he gets here.

1247
01:39:20,087 --> 01:39:23,590
And that's for playing along, Cora.
I think we better open the place up...

1248
01:39:23,758 --> 01:39:26,301
...just the beer garden,
better not let anyone inside.

1249
01:39:26,469 --> 01:39:27,677
All right, Frank.

1250
01:39:33,517 --> 01:39:36,519
I think that's your friend Willie,
but if it's not Willie...

1251
01:39:36,687 --> 01:39:39,689
...I'm gonna give you
another going over just for luck.

1252
01:39:40,858 --> 01:39:42,942
Gesundheit.

1253
01:39:59,293 --> 01:40:02,629
- What gives?
- This. Keep moving.

1254
01:40:05,424 --> 01:40:07,926
All right, Cora, his pockets.

1255
01:40:09,595 --> 01:40:12,555
- Here it is!
FRANK: The other pockets!

1256
01:40:12,723 --> 01:40:15,016
- This is it.
- Here.

1257
01:40:17,144 --> 01:40:19,229
Photostats!

1258
01:40:19,396 --> 01:40:20,772
And the negative.

1259
01:40:21,148 --> 01:40:23,149
So they meant to keep on
blackmailing us.

1260
01:40:23,317 --> 01:40:25,109
Yeah, but not anymore.

1261
01:40:25,277 --> 01:40:26,945
Thanks, boys.

1262
01:40:27,112 --> 01:40:31,366
Come on, I'll show you out.
Come on!

1263
01:40:33,494 --> 01:40:35,954
Come on, come on, come on. Out!

1264
01:40:48,676 --> 01:40:50,718
Well, we did it, didn't we?

1265
01:40:53,264 --> 01:40:56,724
- That's the last of the Photostats.
- Oh, no, it isn't.

1266
01:40:57,309 --> 01:41:00,770
That isn't the last of the Photostats.
I got a million of them here.

1267
01:41:00,938 --> 01:41:04,190
- So you got a million of them.
- Just one is enough for Mr. Sackett.

1268
01:41:04,358 --> 01:41:07,569
You're not foolish enough
to stick your nose in that gas chamber...

1269
01:41:07,736 --> 01:41:09,112
...just to get even with me.

1270
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,447
No, you didn't understand
Mr. Keats at all.

1271
01:41:11,615 --> 01:41:14,784
Once they made it manslaughter,
they can't do anything more to me!

1272
01:41:14,952 --> 01:41:17,161
What's the matter with you, Cora?

1273
01:41:17,454 --> 01:41:19,956
This! While you were
wet-nursing Kennedy...

1274
01:41:20,124 --> 01:41:23,209
...your friend dropped in outside.

1275
01:41:23,377 --> 01:41:27,505
So you're an outlaw,
and you just love Mexican food.

1276
01:41:27,673 --> 01:41:31,467
I hope your broken-down sweetie
brings you plenty to the death house...

1277
01:41:31,635 --> 01:41:33,761
...where I'm going to send you!

1278
01:41:43,981 --> 01:41:46,232
Just hanging up my clean uniforms,
dearie.

1279
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:47,984
That's nice of you.

1280
01:41:48,152 --> 01:41:51,529
- What did you think I was doing?
- I didn't think anything.

1281
01:41:52,031 --> 01:41:55,366
Don't worry, when it's time
to call Mr. Sackett, I'll let you know.

1282
01:41:55,534 --> 01:41:59,370
In the meantime, just take it easy.
You're gonna need all your strength.

1283
01:42:09,632 --> 01:42:12,216
Just taking something
to keep up my strength, dearie.

1284
01:42:12,384 --> 01:42:14,844
- That's nice of you.
- What'd you think I was doing?

1285
01:42:15,012 --> 01:42:16,387
I didn't think anything.

1286
01:42:16,555 --> 01:42:19,599
Don't worry, when I'm ready to skip out,
I'll let you know.

1287
01:42:19,767 --> 01:42:22,936
Just take it easy,
you may need all your strength.

1288
01:42:26,482 --> 01:42:28,358
FRANK:
That's the way it kept up all day.

1289
01:42:28,525 --> 01:42:31,694
Me following her around
for fear she'd call Sackett.

1290
01:42:31,862 --> 01:42:35,657
Her watching me like a hawk,
for fear I'd....

1291
01:42:36,617 --> 01:42:39,202
Both of us hating each other
like poison.

1292
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:41,162
Finally, she went up to bed.

1293
01:42:41,330 --> 01:42:45,124
I went to my room,
but I knew I didn't dare sleep.

1294
01:42:45,292 --> 01:42:47,168
Then all of a sudden....

1295
01:42:56,303 --> 01:42:58,388
- Get away from there or I'll--
- Or you'll what?

1296
01:42:58,555 --> 01:42:59,806
[PHONE RINGS]

1297
01:42:59,974 --> 01:43:02,308
Hello? Yellow Cab?

1298
01:43:02,476 --> 01:43:05,520
We changed our mind.
We don't need a cab now, thanks.

1299
01:43:05,688 --> 01:43:08,022
- Or you'll what?
- Sock you in the jaw maybe.

1300
01:43:08,190 --> 01:43:11,567
Something else, wasn't it?
You've been thinking of a way to kill me.

1301
01:43:11,735 --> 01:43:13,403
- I've been asleep.
- Don't lie to me!

1302
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:15,989
- Because I'm not gonna lie to you.
- All right, I was.

1303
01:43:16,156 --> 01:43:19,325
You were gonna duck out and hand me
over to Sackett, so we're even.

1304
01:43:19,493 --> 01:43:21,869
Right back where we started.

1305
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:24,831
Not quite, Cora.

1306
01:43:24,999 --> 01:43:27,417
That other girl...

1307
01:43:27,584 --> 01:43:30,003
...she didn't mean anything to me.

1308
01:43:30,254 --> 01:43:32,714
She told me you were going away
with her.

1309
01:43:33,132 --> 01:43:35,591
Why didn't I? I planned to,
and never come back.

1310
01:43:35,759 --> 01:43:37,927
Why didn't I go away
and never come back?

1311
01:43:38,929 --> 01:43:41,305
Because we're chained
to each other, Cora.

1312
01:43:41,515 --> 01:43:44,642
- Don't tell me you love me.
- But I do.

1313
01:43:44,810 --> 01:43:48,646
- Oh, but love when fear comes into it....
- Then you hate me?

1314
01:43:49,606 --> 01:43:51,357
I don't know.

1315
01:43:52,401 --> 01:43:55,028
But we've got to tell the truth
for once in our lives.

1316
01:43:55,195 --> 01:43:57,572
All right, why were you gonna
run away then?

1317
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:02,243
I told you I had something to tell you.

1318
01:44:05,581 --> 01:44:06,956
Frank...

1319
01:44:07,124 --> 01:44:09,625
...I wasn't going to Mr. Sackett tonight.

1320
01:44:10,627 --> 01:44:12,045
I was running away...

1321
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,547
...for good.

1322
01:44:14,798 --> 01:44:17,550
So that you
wouldn't ever see me again.

1323
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,303
Me or....

1324
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:23,806
- Me or....
- Cora.

1325
01:44:24,808 --> 01:44:28,102
Oh, no, don't, Frank.
I've got to tell you all about it.

1326
01:44:28,353 --> 01:44:29,854
We....

1327
01:44:30,522 --> 01:44:32,440
We took a life, didn't we, Frank?

1328
01:44:32,608 --> 01:44:35,818
Well, now we can give one back.
Then maybe God will forgive us...

1329
01:44:35,986 --> 01:44:38,071
...and maybe it'll help square us.

1330
01:44:38,363 --> 01:44:40,114
Maybe it will.

1331
01:44:40,282 --> 01:44:43,493
Maybe it'll help.
We've been all mixed up.

1332
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:46,662
Oh, Frank, I couldn't
turn you in to Sackett.

1333
01:44:46,830 --> 01:44:51,375
I couldn't have this baby and then
have it find out I'd sent its father...

1334
01:44:52,002 --> 01:44:54,796
...into that poison gas chamber
for murder.

1335
01:44:55,547 --> 01:44:56,881
Was...?

1336
01:44:57,049 --> 01:44:59,509
Was the baby the only reason?

1337
01:45:01,345 --> 01:45:02,845
No.

1338
01:45:03,180 --> 01:45:07,141
Oh, Frank. Please, there's one thing
I have to be sure of.

1339
01:45:07,309 --> 01:45:09,060
No, don't ask me any questions.

1340
01:45:09,228 --> 01:45:13,147
Just take me down to the beach.
We've been so happy there.

1341
01:45:13,315 --> 01:45:15,733
And let's be happy again...

1342
01:45:15,901 --> 01:45:17,276
...just once more.

1343
01:45:17,444 --> 01:45:21,155
And then I promise that everything will
be settled, one way or the other...

1344
01:45:21,323 --> 01:45:23,324
...before we come back.

1345
01:45:24,493 --> 01:45:26,702
I'll get the car, Cora.

1346
01:45:37,756 --> 01:45:38,840
Frank.

1347
01:45:39,007 --> 01:45:41,801
All the hate and revenge has left me...

1348
01:45:41,969 --> 01:45:44,220
...but is it all out of you?

1349
01:45:44,388 --> 01:45:48,391
I'm trying to find some way
I could prove it to you.

1350
01:45:49,768 --> 01:45:51,894
Maybe I know a way.

1351
01:45:52,563 --> 01:45:55,439
Let's swim out there, way, way out...

1352
01:45:55,607 --> 01:45:58,901
...until we're so tired that
we'll just barely be able to get back.

1353
01:45:59,069 --> 01:46:01,154
- How is that gonna prove--?
- Please, Frank.

1354
01:46:01,321 --> 01:46:03,489
Come on, I'll show you.

1355
01:46:26,763 --> 01:46:28,389
This is far enough.

1356
01:46:28,557 --> 01:46:32,268
- Are you tired?
- Very tired. How about you?

1357
01:46:32,436 --> 01:46:34,187
I'm still all right.

1358
01:46:34,354 --> 01:46:35,730
Frank...

1359
01:46:35,898 --> 01:46:38,107
...what I wanted to be sure of was...

1360
01:46:38,275 --> 01:46:40,902
...whether you trust me.

1361
01:46:41,236 --> 01:46:44,655
If you don't believe
that I can never turn on you again...

1362
01:46:46,158 --> 01:46:48,951
...and if you don't want me to go back
with you...

1363
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:51,787
...you could swim back by yourself.

1364
01:46:52,039 --> 01:46:54,832
I'm too tired,
I could never make it alone.

1365
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,417
Nobody will ever know.

1366
01:46:56,585 --> 01:47:00,963
Cora, Cora, don't say another word.
Darling, save your strength.

1367
01:47:01,131 --> 01:47:02,965
I'll take you in.

1368
01:47:40,879 --> 01:47:42,880
Are you sure now?

1369
01:47:44,549 --> 01:47:45,967
I'm sure.

1370
01:47:55,352 --> 01:47:58,521
I've been waiting a long time
for that kiss.

1371
01:47:58,855 --> 01:48:02,566
When we get home, Frank,
then there will be kisses.

1372
01:48:02,776 --> 01:48:05,319
Kisses with dreams in them.

1373
01:48:05,529 --> 01:48:09,031
Kisses that come from life,
not death.

1374
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:11,117
I hope I can wait.

1375
01:48:12,744 --> 01:48:14,537
Darling.

1376
01:48:19,209 --> 01:48:20,626
Look out!

1377
01:48:20,794 --> 01:48:22,295
Frank!

1378
01:48:32,889 --> 01:48:34,056
Cora.

1379
01:48:44,568 --> 01:48:47,069
SACKETT: This man, Frank Chambers,
and the dead woman...

1380
01:48:47,237 --> 01:48:50,406
...first murdered her husband
to get his estate.

1381
01:48:50,574 --> 01:48:53,951
Then Chambers murdered her
so that he'd have it all to himself.

1382
01:48:56,413 --> 01:48:58,956
The jury was out five minutes.

1383
01:48:59,124 --> 01:49:00,833
The judge said in sentencing me...

1384
01:49:01,001 --> 01:49:03,252
...that he was giving
the same consideration...

1385
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:05,046
...he'd show any other mad dog.

1386
01:49:05,213 --> 01:49:06,714
I see.

1387
01:49:07,007 --> 01:49:08,507
I see.

1388
01:49:09,092 --> 01:49:10,634
And now, Father...

1389
01:49:10,802 --> 01:49:13,346
...comes the important thing
you can do for me.

1390
01:49:13,513 --> 01:49:14,972
Do you think she knows?

1391
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:17,933
Knows that you didn't kill her?

1392
01:49:18,101 --> 01:49:19,935
She must know it.

1393
01:49:21,188 --> 01:49:24,231
But that's the awful part
when you monkey with murder.

1394
01:49:24,775 --> 01:49:26,275
Somehow...

1395
01:49:26,902 --> 01:49:30,613
...maybe it flashed through her head
when the car hit...

1396
01:49:30,781 --> 01:49:32,740
...that maybe I did do it.

1397
01:49:32,908 --> 01:49:35,242
Father, do you think she knows
the truth?

1398
01:49:35,410 --> 01:49:37,370
We can hope.

1399
01:49:37,537 --> 01:49:40,164
We got off to a wrong start,
and somehow or other...

1400
01:49:40,332 --> 01:49:42,458
...we never got back on the right track.

1401
01:49:42,626 --> 01:49:44,710
But I didn't kill her.

1402
01:49:44,878 --> 01:49:48,339
I loved her so much,
I tell you, I would have died for her!

1403
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:56,806
I just talked to the governor.

1404
01:50:00,811 --> 01:50:02,269
But, I....

1405
01:50:02,437 --> 01:50:03,813
I didn't do it.

1406
01:50:03,980 --> 01:50:06,524
- I didn't do it, I tell you!
- Wait a minute!

1407
01:50:06,691 --> 01:50:08,567
All right, suppose you didn't do it.

1408
01:50:08,735 --> 01:50:12,446
Get me a new trial. I'm not gonna
go in that gas chamber for killing her!

1409
01:50:12,614 --> 01:50:17,284
Suppose you got a stay of execution, new
trial, acquittal of killing Cora. Then what?

1410
01:50:17,828 --> 01:50:21,330
Last night they auctioned off the fixtures
at the Twin Oaks.

1411
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:26,168
A man who bought the cash register
found a note in the back of the drawer.

1412
01:50:26,336 --> 01:50:29,880
He brought it to me.
It's addressed to you.

1413
01:50:30,048 --> 01:50:31,841
Cora wrote it.

1414
01:50:40,725 --> 01:50:43,102
It's a very beautiful note, Frank...

1415
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:46,772
...written by a girl
who loved a man very much.

1416
01:50:47,441 --> 01:50:50,693
I imagine it was written
earlier the very night she died.

1417
01:50:50,861 --> 01:50:53,028
A note of farewell, isn't it?

1418
01:50:53,530 --> 01:50:56,740
She did try and run away that night.

1419
01:50:58,160 --> 01:51:02,538
And since she had no idea anyone
would ever see that note but you...

1420
01:51:02,706 --> 01:51:05,541
...it therefore has
just enough of a confession...

1421
01:51:05,709 --> 01:51:08,627
...to convict you of helping her
kill her husband.

1422
01:51:10,213 --> 01:51:13,549
So if you were to leave this room
because you didn't kill her...

1423
01:51:13,717 --> 01:51:17,595
...you'd soon be back here again
for helping her kill Nick.

1424
01:51:18,138 --> 01:51:19,346
What's the use?

1425
01:51:23,393 --> 01:51:24,894
Then....

1426
01:51:25,061 --> 01:51:29,440
Then what's gonna happen to me
is not because I killed her?

1427
01:51:29,608 --> 01:51:32,443
No, laddie, for killing Nick.

1428
01:51:34,571 --> 01:51:36,238
You know...

1429
01:51:36,656 --> 01:51:39,408
...there's something about this
that's like....

1430
01:51:39,576 --> 01:51:41,202
Well, it's like...

1431
01:51:41,953 --> 01:51:43,412
...you're expecting...

1432
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:46,415
...a letter that you're just crazy
to get...

1433
01:51:48,210 --> 01:51:50,586
...and you hang around
the front door...

1434
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:54,215
...for fear you might not hear him ring.

1435
01:51:54,591 --> 01:51:57,760
You never realize
that he always rings twice.

1436
01:51:58,595 --> 01:51:59,637
What's that?

1437
01:51:59,804 --> 01:52:02,223
Well, he rang twice for Cora...

1438
01:52:02,390 --> 01:52:05,392
...and now he's ringing twice for me,
isn't he?

1439
01:52:07,562 --> 01:52:09,021
That's about it.

1440
01:52:09,189 --> 01:52:12,858
The truth is, you always
hear him ring the second time.

1441
01:52:13,026 --> 01:52:15,861
Even if you're way out in the backyard.

1442
01:52:17,614 --> 01:52:19,114
Father.

1443
01:52:19,991 --> 01:52:21,784
You were right.

1444
01:52:21,993 --> 01:52:23,661
It all works out.

1445
01:52:23,828 --> 01:52:27,790
I guess God knows more
about these things than we do.

1446
01:52:27,958 --> 01:52:29,833
Somehow or other...

1447
01:52:30,001 --> 01:52:32,753
...Cora paid for Nick's life with hers.

1448
01:52:33,338 --> 01:52:35,339
And now I'm going to.

1449
01:52:36,591 --> 01:52:37,633
Father...

1450
01:52:37,801 --> 01:52:40,970
...would you send up a prayer
for me and Cora?

1451
01:52:41,137 --> 01:52:43,722
And if you could find it in your heart...

1452
01:52:43,890 --> 01:52:47,476
...make it that we're together,
wherever it is.

1453
01:52:53,567 --> 01:52:55,568
