("Barcelona" by
Giulia y Los Tellarini plays)

00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:02,706
NARRATOR: Vicky and Cristina decided
to spend the summer in Barcelona.

3
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,750
Vicky was completing her master's
in Catalan Identity,

4
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:07,377
which she had become interested in

5
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,297
through her great affection
for the architecture of Gaudí.

6
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:13,508
Cristina, who spent the last six months

7
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:17,262
writing, directing, and acting in
a 12-minute film which she then hated,

8
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,472
had just broken up
with yet another boyfriend

9
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:21,474
and longed for a change of scenery.

10
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:22,892
Everything fell into place

11
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:25,770
when a distant relative of Vicky's family
who lived in Barcelona

12
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:28,648
offered to put both girls up
for July and August.

13
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,693
The two best friends
had been close since college

14
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,446
and shared the same tastes
and opinions on most matters,

15
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,489
yet when it came to the subject of love,

16
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:39,784
it would be hard to find
two more dissimilar viewpoints.

17
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:43,246
Vicky had no tolerance for pain
and no lust for combat.

18
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:45,790
- She was grounded and realistic.
- (phone ringing)

19
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,877
Her requirements in a man
were seriousness and stability.

20
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:52,922
She had become engaged to Doug
because he was decent and successful

21
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,258
and understood
the beauty of commitment.

22
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:58,303
Yeah, I miss you, too.

23
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,013
Cristina, on the other hand,

24
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,849
expected something
very different out of love.

25
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:07,062
She had reluctantly accepted suffering
as an inevitable component of deep passion,

26
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,731
and was resigned to putting
her feelings at risk.

27
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:13,151
If you asked her what it was
she was gambling her emotions on to win,

28
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,903
she would not have been able to say.

29
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,863
She knew what she didn't want, however,

30
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,075
and that was exactly
what Vicky valued above all else.

31
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,039
Hello?

32
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,374
JUDY: Oh, hello.

33
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,917
- Hi.
- Hi!

34
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,044
- You're Vicky.
- Yes, yes.

35
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,545
You're so grown up!

36
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,049
- Well, it's been a while.
- Hola, welcome to Barcelona.

37
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,510
- Hi. Cristina.
- Oh, Cristina, I'm Judy.

38
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,887
- This is your room.
- VICKY: Oh, perfect!

39
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,098
- I put you together.
- CRISTINA: This is gorgeous.

40
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:46,059
Judy, thank you so much
for having me here, because I know...

41
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,104
you know, it's so last-minute
and you don't know me at all.

42
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,606
To include me is just so sweet of you.

43
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,193
JUDY: It's so nice to have
a little action around here.

44
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:58,154
It's been so quiet
since Arthur went off to college.

45
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,614
After the girls unpacked

46
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,283
and Judy's husband Mark
got home from the golf course,

47
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:04,035
lunch was served on the terrace.

48
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,287
- JUDY: ...beautiful home.
- MARK: We've come to love it.

49
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:09,165
JUDY: He makes friends with anybody
and he speaks the language,

50
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,834
so he was like, "Whee!"

51
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,502
MARK: You learned just fine.

52
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,295
So, what do you do, Cristina?

53
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,465
I am currently at liberty.

54
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,259
Oh, come on.
She... she made a film.

55
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,803
- How exciting!
- Yes, 12 minutes.

56
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,221
What was it about?

57
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:29,227
About? It was about
why love is so hard to define.

58
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,605
Wow, that's a mighty big subject
to handle in 12 minutes.

59
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,815
(chuckles)

60
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:37,026
JUDY: Vicky, you're getting
your master's in something.

61
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,571
Yeah, my master's in Catalan Identity.

62
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,448
JUDY: (chuckling) Ah, well...

63
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,241
What do you plan on doing with that?

64
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:47,203
Oh, God, I don't know.
Maybe teaching, maybe curating.

65
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:49,664
Well, you don't have
to do something, you know.

66
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,292
But she's marrying
this wonderful man in the fall,

67
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:56,087
and all of her conflicts will be resolved
when he makes her pregnant.

68
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:58,381
(laughing)

69
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,967
Well, now that Judy's
decided your future...

70
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,721
To, uh, your summer in Barcelona.

71
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,097
- Welcome.
- MARK: Salud.

72
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:08,224
- Cheers.
- Salud.

73
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:11,311
In the days that followed,

74
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:14,814
Vicky and Cristina drank in
the artistic treasures of the city.

75
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:18,151
They particularly enjoyed
the works of Gaudí and Miró.

76
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,737
("Barcelona" reprises)

77
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,999
Once, Mark and Judy
invited Vicky and Cristina

78
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,627
to go sailing with them
on Mark's boat.

79
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:38,046
With Cristina in mind,

80
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,508
Mark and Judy asked along
the son of one of his business partners,

81
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,010
an eligible young man
Mark thought she might like.

82
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:47,096
My dream is to accumulate enough wealth
and sail off to an island somewhere

83
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,307
and spend the rest
of my days snorkeling.

84
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,226
I'm actually a snorkeling nut.

85
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,145
Have you ever snorkeled before?

86
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:59,692
Unfortunately, Charles and Cristina
were not a match made in heaven.

87
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:03,863
Vicky, meanwhile, researched
every aspect of Catalan life,

88
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:06,533
even getting a tour of the market
and a local restaurant

89
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,785
to delve into Catalan cooking.

90
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,704
On balmy summer nights,

91
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:14,415
the girls would sometimes
go to hear Spanish guitar music,

92
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,877
which never failed to move Vicky
in some magical way.

93
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:20,964
("Asturias" continues
on unaccompanied guitar)

94
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:35,228
One evening, Mark and Judy took them
to the opening of a friend's art gallery.

95
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,189
Many local artists
and a number of collectors attended.

96
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:39,482
JUDY: Do you like them?

97
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,651
VICKY: I do.
Thank you so much for taking us.

98
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,653
You know, we buy from this gallery.

99
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,615
Mark has commissioned this artist
to do this series of pictures

100
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,159
for his office walls, so...

101
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,787
- I think they'll be beauti...
- Is that the artist over there?

102
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,122
- JUDY: Where?
- In the red?

103
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,457
Uh, no. No, no, no.

104
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,793
That's not... no.

105
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,962
Uh, Alfred is...

106
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:04,465
Oh, no, he's the gentleman
in the linen coat, right there.

107
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,883
- CRISTINA: Oh.
- That's him.

108
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:09,387
Um... I don't know who that is.

109
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,850
Uh, Mark, who is that gentleman
in the red shirt over there?

110
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,227
- Who?
- The gentleman in the red shirt.

111
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:18,855
- Who is that?
- Oh. He's a painter.

112
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,982
Remember, Diego told us about him?

113
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:24,402
He had that fiery relationship
with that beautiful woman who was nuts?

114
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,654
- Oh, my God!
- With the violent fighting...

115
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:28,990
- Oh, yes, yes, yes!
- He had the messy divorce.

116
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,200
- Oh, my God!
- It was in all the newspapers.

117
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:35,663
Oh, my God. Um, his name
is Juan Antonio Gonzalo,

118
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:39,500
and he had this hot divorce
and she tried to kill him.

119
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,127
- Or he tried to kill her.
- What?

120
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,838
It was this, like,
really big thing in the art world.

121
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:47,800
I can't remember the details,
but he, you know, he...

122
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,595
We don't move in those
bohemian circles, so I don't know.

123
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,680
(guests greeting
each other in Spanish)

124
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:56,351
##

125
00:07:57,353 --> 00:08:01,147
Vicky and Cristina left the art gallery
and decided to go for dinner.

126
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,400
They strolled past the church
in the wonderful summer night air

127
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,027
while people celebrated,

128
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,946
finally winding up around midnight
at a little restaurant.

129
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:13,201
Well, it's just nice to be able
to not have to worry about

130
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,244
if some place is gonna stay open, or...

131
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:19,874
Yeah, but you... we probably should be
worrying about our, you know, dreams.

132
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,835
What are you... who are you looking at?

133
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,839
Isn't that the... isn't that the painter
we just saw at the gallery?

134
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:31,844
VICKY: Oh, yeah, right. He's the...
the painter with the bad divorce...

135
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,138
Mark told us... I was half-listening.

136
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,682
He was looking over here.

137
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,935
Well, that's because
you keep provoking contact.

138
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,687
- I'm not provoking contact!
- You are.

139
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,064
You've been throwing
little looks at him all night.

140
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,857
I'm just drinking my wine.

141
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,442
Mm-hmm, yeah, of course you are.

142
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:50,279
You must be doing something,
because, uh, he's coming over.

143
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,421
American?

144
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:09,841
I'm Cristina,
and this is my friend Vicky.

145
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,885
What color are your eyes?

146
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,431
Uh... they're blue.

147
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,394
I'd like to invite you both
to come with me to Oviedo.

148
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:22,854
To come where?

149
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,481
To Oviedo.
For the weekend.

150
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,400
We leave in one hour.

151
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,402
What... where is Oviedo?

152
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,446
- A very short flight.
- By plane?

153
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,573
What's in Oviedo?

154
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:36,909
I go to see a sculpture
that is very inspiring to me.

155
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,162
Very beautiful sculpture.
You will love it.

156
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:44,917
Oh, right, you're asking us
to fly to Oviedo and back.

157
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:47,628
No, we'll spend the weekend.

158
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:51,340
I mean, I'll show you around the city
and we'll eat well,

159
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,844
we'll drink good wine,
we'll make love.

160
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,972
Yeah, well, who exactly
is going to "make love"?

161
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,057
Hopefully, the three of us.

162
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,768
- Oh, my God.
- I'll get your bill.

163
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,228
Jesus, this guy!
He doesn't beat around the bush.

164
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:07,565
Look, señor, maybe in a different life.

165
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:14,405
Why not? Life is short,
life is dull, life is full of pain,

166
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,741
and this is a chance
for something special.

167
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,202
Right, well, who exactly are you?

168
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,454
I am Juan Antonio.
And you are...

169
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,583
Vicky, and you are Cristina, right?

170
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,169
Or is it the other way around?

171
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,421
- Yeah, that's right.
- It could be the other way around,

172
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:31,798
because frankly it doesn't matter,

173
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,841
because either of us will do
to keep the bed warm.

174
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,384
You know, I get it.

175
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,929
Well, you are both
so lovely and beautiful.

176
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:41,474
Yeah, thank you,
but we do not fly off to make love

177
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:45,436
with whoever invites us
to charming little Spanish towns.

178
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:49,524
Does she always
analyze every inspiration

179
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,235
until its grain of charm is...

180
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,655
- Uh... (speaks Spanish)
- (knocks on table)

181
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,406
squeezed out of it?

182
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,493
I guess I have to say that I'm...

183
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:06,123
My eyes are green, actually.

184
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,583
VICKY: Oh, God, look...

185
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:12,213
I wouldn't call our reluctance
to leap at your sexual offer

186
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,840
being over-analytical.

187
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:17,760
If you would care to join us
for some recognized form

188
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:21,138
of social interaction,
like a drink, then we'd be fine,

189
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:26,018
but otherwise, I think you should try,
you know, offering to some other table.

190
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,104
What offended you about the offer?

191
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:33,442
Surely not that I find you both
beautiful and desirable?

192
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:34,861
Offended me? No.

193
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:39,115
It's very amusing...
galling, to be honest... but...

194
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,660
ls it my imagination,
or is it getting late?

195
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,288
- Shall we go?
- I would love to go to Oviedo.

196
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,747
What? Are you kidding?

197
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,583
- Can we discuss...
- I think it would be so much fun.

198
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,585
I think we should go.
I would love to go.

199
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,212
Cristina, can we discuss this
some other time, when...

200
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:56,340
You know, when I saw you
across the room at the art gallery,

201
00:11:56,425 --> 00:12:00,386
I noticed you have, uh, beautiful lips.

202
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,930
Very full, very sensual.

203
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,223
Thank you.

204
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:06,475
Okay, okay, look.
If you want to go...

205
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,354
Well, I can't guarantee the lovemaking,
because I happen to be very moody.

206
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:13,441
Let's not negotiate like a contract.

207
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:17,737
I came over here with no subterfuge
and presented my best offer.

208
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:21,449
Now I hope you will discuss it
and give me the pleasure

209
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,200
to take you with me to Oviedo.

210
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,870
I have the good fortune
to borrow my friend's plane.

211
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:29,624
It is just big enough for the three of us,
and I am a very good pilot.

212
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,334
Oh, it sounds very safe.

213
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,794
Think it over.

214
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,176
I hope you're joking about going.

215
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,261
My God, this guy is so interesting.

216
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:44,138
Interesting?
What's so interesting?

217
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,973
He wants to get us both into bed.

218
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:48,809
You know, but he'll settle for either,
in this case you.

219
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,479
Vicky, I'm a big girl, okay?

220
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,231
If I want to sleep with him I will;
if not, I won't.

221
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,317
Cristina, he's a total stranger.

222
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,402
This is impulsive even for you.

223
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:02,156
And, if I heard right,
he was violent with his wife.

224
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,660
At least he's not one of those
factory-made zombies, you know?

225
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,912
I mean, this would be
a great way to get to know him.

226
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,163
No, it's not.

227
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,668
I'm not going to Oviedo
with this charmingly candid wife beater.

228
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:17,213
You find his aggressiveness
attractive, but I don't.

229
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,757
I mean, he's certainly not handsome.

230
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,510
Well, I think he's very handsome.
He's got a great look.

231
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,762
I mean, he's,
you know, he's really sexy.

232
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:28,057
Mm-hmm, well, you would,
because you're a neurotic.

233
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,101
You gotta admire
his no-bullshit approach.

234
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,228
What are you talking about?
It's all bullshit.

235
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:36,065
I'm not going to Oviedo.
First off, I never heard of Oviedo.

236
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,650
- I don't find him winning.
- (cell phone rings)

237
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,528
Third, even if I wasn't engaged
and was free to have

238
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:44,448
some kind of dalliance with a Spaniard,
I wouldn't pick this one.

239
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:45,658
Hello?

240
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,035
Hi. Oh, hi.
I can't talk right now.

241
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,582
I'm trying to save Cristina
from making a potentially fatal mistake.

242
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,669
What? No, the usual.

243
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,504
Yeah, I'll call you back.

244
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,006
I love you, too.

245
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,882
If we go back to the house now,

246
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,635
we can just throw some things
in a bag and meet him there.

247
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,054
Look, I took
an instant liking to this guy.

248
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,391
I mean, he's not one
of these cookie-cutter molds.

249
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:13,102
He's creative and he's artistic and...

250
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,022
Cookie-cutter mold?
ls that what you think of Doug?

251
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,399
Doug? Who said anything about Doug?

252
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,048
It's ridiculous.
You like the way it sounds,

253
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:23,612
to pick up and fly
off in an airplane.

254
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:27,074
I know. I don't know why I'm so scared,
unless I'm scared of myself.

255
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,285
It's a mistake, Cristina.

256
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,788
(airplane whirrs; thunder rumbles)

257
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,588
JUAN ANTONIO: They predicted a little storm
out of the town, out of Oviedo,

258
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,131
but it's nothing serious.

259
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,507
Don't you worry, really.

260
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:44,925
As you can see here...

261
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:49,388
Here it's just...
just a little bumpy, all right?

262
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:52,433
(thunder rumbles)

263
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,310
Would you like to fly it?

264
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,770
CRISTINA: Oh, no thank you.

265
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:59,023
JUAN ANTONIO: It's easy.
It's even easier than a car. Try it.

266
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,073
By early morning,
they had reached their destination

267
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:10,868
and proceeded to a hotel
that Juan Antonio had selected for them.

268
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,872
Vicky made sure she and Cristina
had their own room...

269
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,249
and Juan Antonio had his.

270
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,710
If he was disappointed,
he hid it well.

271
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:23,631
After freshening up,
he took them to see the sculpture

272
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,257
that was so meaningful to him.

273
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:28,677
- CRISTINA: Are you very religious?
- JUAN ANTONIO: No, no, I'm not.

274
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,471
The trick is to enjoy life,

275
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,557
accepting it has
no meaning whatsoever.

276
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:34,683
- Right.
- No meaning?

277
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,603
You don't think that authentic love
gives life meaning?

278
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,606
Yes, but love is so transient.

279
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,066
Isn't it?

280
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,402
I was in love with
a most incredible woman...

281
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:50,241
and then in the end...

282
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,244
Yes?

283
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,830
(sighs) She put a knife into me.

284
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,832
My God, that's terrible.

285
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,251
Maybe you did something
to deserve it.

286
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,505
Juan Antonio
took his guests for lunch.

287
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,049
They discussed art and romance.

288
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,844
He was full of stories
about Maria Elena, his ex-wife,

289
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,721
whom he both criticized and idolized.

290
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,558
He proved to be a good host,

291
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,102
and in the afternoon
he took them to see the local sights,

292
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:21,105
where they enjoyed hearing
about the city and took photos.

293
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:25,985
##

294
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:33,242
Later, they bought candy and cakes
at a charming sweet shop,

295
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,786
which were homemade and delicious.

296
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,918
They continued to document their trip,

297
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,753
and while Vicky remained skeptical,

298
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,839
Cristina had a wonderful time.

299
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:56,891
The question of sleeping together
did not come up until that night,

300
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,059
and Juan Antonio was a little drunk.

301
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,811
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

302
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,147
All right.

303
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,445
Well, now that the day's almost over...

304
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:15,868
is it reasonable of me to ask you
if you'll both join me in my room?

305
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,786
Oh, come on, I thought we'd settled that.

306
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,956
Vicky's just trying to say that
she's engaged to be married, that's all.

307
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,125
Great. Then these are
her last days of freedom.

308
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,879
No. Look, I'm not free.
I'm committed.

309
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,257
You know what my theory is...
and when I drink, I get brutally frank...

310
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:33,010
I think that you're still hurting

311
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:36,597
from the failure of your marriage
to Maria Elena,

312
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:40,226
and you're trying to lose yourself
in empty sex.

313
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,852
Empty sex?

314
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:44,647
Do you have such
a low opinion of yourself?

315
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,858
She's just saying that it has to have
meaning for her, that's all.

316
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:52,780
I mean, the city's romantic,
the night is warm and balmy,

317
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:55,324
we are alive...
isn't that meaning enough?

318
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,952
Hey, look, I just came along
to keep Cristina company.

319
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,787
I'm engaged to be married.

320
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:04,208
I have a handsome, lovely fiancé
who I make love with,

321
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,628
and also holds
a very real place in my heart,

322
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,838
and to be perfectly frank,
Juan Antonio,

323
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,174
if I were the type of person
that played around,

324
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,134
I don't think it's in the cards for us.

325
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:18,806
So, I'm tired,
I haven't slept in 24 hours,

326
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,392
and that is exactly
what I am going to do.

327
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,853
And you?

328
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,484
I'll go to your room,
but... you have to seduce me.

329
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,115
- Hello.
- Hello.

330
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:41,662
(cautiously) I am just here
to have a quick drink...

331
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,330
to say thank you,

332
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,582
and then I'm going to go
back to my room.

333
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,502
All right.

334
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,130
Did you act
in the small film you made?

335
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,507
Did I act?
Yeah, I acted. Why?

336
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,634
I hope you were
more convincing than you are

337
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,304
when you pretend to have come here
for one quick drink.

338
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:04,143
I am here to go to bed with you.
You're right, um...

339
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:10,482
So you're pretty much home free,
unless you... blow it.

340
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,942
- Blow it?
- Yeah.

341
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,404
"Blow it."
You mean ruin the moment?

342
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,697
Yeah.

343
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,615
Oh. And how would I do that?

344
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,327
Um, I don't know.

345
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:25,622
It could be anything
from some inane comment

346
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:28,751
to wearing the wrong kind of shorts.

347
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:32,212
Although...
somehow by looking at you,

348
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:35,049
I think you're wearing
the right kind of shorts.

349
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,843
- You're very hard to please.
- (pouring wine)

350
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:41,638
Yeah, well. I am famous
for my intolerance.

351
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:42,723
Here.

352
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,726
(sighs)

353
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,147
What do you want in life
besides a man with the right shorts?

354
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,316
Mmm...

355
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:54,902
I don't know.

356
00:19:56,404 --> 00:20:01,241
I know I'm not gonna settle
till I find what I'm looking for.

357
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,369
Mm, which is what?

358
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,955
Um.

359
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,043
Something... else.

360
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,796
I want something different,
something more...

361
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:19,551
some sort of counterintuitive love.

362
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,180
Meaning?

363
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,350
Meaning...

364
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,104
I don't know.

365
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,189
I don't know what I want.

366
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,108
I only know what I don't want.

367
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,613
If you don't start undressing me soon,
this is gonna turn into a panel discussion.

368
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,797
(shudders)

369
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,340
What? Are you okay?

370
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:01,051
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
It's something I ate.

371
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,846
What's wrong?
Can I get you anything?

372
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,348
Um, no, I...

373
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,600
- I shouldn't be drinking.
- What happened?

374
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:09,852
I'm going to be sick.

375
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:16,483
It's her ulcer, and perhaps
a little food poisoning, maybe both.

376
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:17,609
Oh, my God, both?

377
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,153
She must just "ret," not eat.

378
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:21,738
- Okay, rest?
- Yeah, rest. Rest.

379
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:25,659
With Cristina stuck in bed,
Vicky was anxious to get back to Barcelona

380
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,202
and in no mood to sightsee.

381
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,454
Uh-huh, oh, okay.

382
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:32,666
Well, when he gets out of his meeting,
can you get him to call me on my cell?

383
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,751
Yeah, I'm still stuck in Oviedo.

384
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,589
But sightsee is what they did.

385
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:40,549
I feel very sorry about Cristina.

386
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,842
VICKY: Oh, come on.

387
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,219
Don't pretend concern.

388
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:47,764
I'm sure that you kept
encouraging her to drink,

389
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:50,100
as you did to both of us
throughout dinner.

390
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,394
But I can hold my liquor.

391
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,396
She never mentioned her ulcer.

392
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:58,901
No, no, because
she's a mental adolescent,

393
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:02,988
and being romantic,
she has a death wish.

394
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,574
So, for a brief moment of passion,

395
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:09,912
she completely abandons
all responsibilities.

396
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:15,667
After lunch, Juan Antonio took Vicky
to see the old lighthouse at Avilés,

397
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,628
which she found very beautiful.

398
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:21,840
Uh, I was born near here, and...

399
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:26,553
it would be a sin if I came out here
without paying a visit to my father.

400
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:28,013
Will be that boring to you?

401
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,057
Bor... no.

402
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,017
No, I think that... that would be

403
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:35,395
the first genuinely interesting
proposition you've made me.

404
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,107
I would love to see
your father and his house.

405
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:42,653
("Gorrion" by Juan Serrano plays)

406
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:49,409
(speaking Spanish)

407
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,411
(speaking Spanish)

408
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,375
(introduces Vicky)

409
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,252
(flatly) Buenos días.

410
00:22:58,336 --> 00:22:59,920
- My father, Julio.
- Julio.

411
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,256
Buenos días.
Qué casa tan bonita.

412
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,424
(speaks Spanish)

413
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:07,135
Oh. You know, if we carry on,
I don't think it's gonna...

414
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,595
It's fine. That was great.

415
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,930
He speaks no English.

416
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,515
(explains in Spanish)

417
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,810
(replies in Spanish)

418
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,937
I'm sure my Spanish is going to go.

419
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,022
He refuses to speak
any other language,

420
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:21,233
and that's an important point
with my father, actually.

421
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,317
Really, it is? Why?

422
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,111
Because he's a poet,

423
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:27,739
and he writes the most beautiful sentences
in the Spanish language,

424
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,700
but he, I don't know,
he doesn't believe

425
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:33,745
that a poet should pollute
his words by any other tongue.

426
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,456
- Which is quite a...
- No. No, it makes sense.

427
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:40,627
I understand, 'cause of the translation
and the things you might lose.

428
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:42,546
I mean, I took some Spanish.

429
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,757
I... of course,
I have no flair for languages.

430
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:47,968
- I read it much better than I speak it.
- Mm-hmm.

431
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,804
Maybe I could read your father?

432
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:53,223
No, but he doesn't publish.
That's the point.

433
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:54,766
Why not?

434
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,727
Be... I'll explain later.

435
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,186
You want some coñac?

436
00:23:58,271 --> 00:23:59,646
(stuttering)

437
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:02,899
Yes, thank you, just a very...
very, very little bit.

438
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,160
Eh, Maria Elena, Maria Elena...

439
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:32,095
- (insects chirping)
- ("El Noi de la Mare" plays)

440
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:37,434
This was my favorite place
to come and read when I was young.

441
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,772
Yes, I wanted to be a writer,
not a painter.

442
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:43,523
Painting came later.

443
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:46,026
And I wanted to play music, too.

444
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,904
I mean, all I knew is that I was full of,

445
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:52,949
I don't know, real emotion,
and I had to find a way to express it.

446
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,952
Cristina says the same thing.

447
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:58,538
Cristina's a very interesting girl.
Want to sit?

448
00:24:58,623 --> 00:24:59,623
Yeah.

449
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:06,588
So, uh, tell me, why won't
your father publish his poems?

450
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:10,717
Well, because he hates the world,

451
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:14,096
and that's his way
of getting back at them,

452
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,014
to create beautiful works and then...

453
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,018
to deny them to the public,
which I think it's...

454
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,145
My God.

455
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,733
Well, what makes him so angry
toward the human race?

456
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:30,529
Because after thousands
of years of civilization,

457
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:33,031
they still haven't learned to love.

458
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,576
They returned to the hotel.

459
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:39,454
Cristina was feeling better,
but far too shaky,

460
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,331
and needed more rest.

461
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:45,460
Vicky and Juan Antonio dined
together at lovely little restaurant.

462
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:49,172
She was more relaxed than at lunch,
and had just finished a great deal of wine.

463
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,509
This time, she was enjoying
the conversation.

464
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,261
...no place on earth.

465
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:57,180
- My father used to bring me here.

466
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,520
Hello?

467
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:06,481
Hey. Did I get you
at a bad time, babe?

468
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:09,109
Oh, hi, no.
I'm just about to eat.

469
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,986
Can I, uh, call you back?

470
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,279
Let me just say one thing.

471
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,489
Paul and Maryanne said they found
a house up where they are

472
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:17,242
that they liked even better
than the one in Bedford Hills.

473
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:21,037
Oh, yeah?
Y-y-you're breaking up a little.

474
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:26,126
(louder) Babe? Call me later, but this
house has a pool and a tennis court.

475
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,337
Okay? We could both take lessons
from Paul's instructor.

476
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:33,258
Okay, I'll call you back.
I can't hear you.

477
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,718
I love you.

478
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,721
Uh... (sighs) Oh, God.

479
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,556
Connection's terrible.

480
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:45,854
- Oh, thank you.
- Here.

481
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,105
(pours small amount)

482
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,315
What is this wine?

483
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,025
- It's delicious.
- It's great.

484
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,862
(clears throat) Was that your fiancé?

485
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,698
Uh, yes, yes.

486
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:59,451
Why were you so nervous,
speaking to him?

487
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,328
What, was I nervous?

488
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:03,580
Yes. You turned red.

489
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,165
Well...

490
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,417
Well, I'm sure it's the wine.

491
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:10,253
Would he be upset if he knew
we were dining together?

492
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:12,088
No, not at all.
Are you kidding?

493
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:17,636
I mean, I don't think he'd love
the basic concept of me

494
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,181
sitting with a man,
drinking wine over candlelight,

495
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:24,768
but he'd quickly realize
there'd be nothing to worry about, so...

496
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:29,481
Would you ever withhold your work
from the public out of rage?

497
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,650
No, no, no, not like my father.

498
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,318
Oh no, I told you...

499
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:36,154
I affirm life despite everything.

500
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:38,907
Right, right.

501
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:44,120
Well... I'd be curious
to see your work.

502
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,164
Really?

503
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:51,002
Why? I mean,
you are so disapproving of me.

504
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:53,380
Well, I've gotten to know you better,

505
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:56,758
and, you know, it'd be interesting,

506
00:27:56,843 --> 00:28:00,053
and, after all, you are a Catalan painter,
and that's my subject.

507
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,514
What gave you such an interest
in Catalan culture?

508
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:08,270
Well, uh... I, uh, fell in love
with Gaudí's church when I was 14,

509
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,188
and one thing led to another.

510
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:16,528
Hmm. And, uh, you also admire
Spanish guitar, I hear?

511
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:19,531
Yes, yes. I love the guitar.

512
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:23,535
Would you like to go to hear
some wonderful guitar tonight?

513
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,078
- Tonight?
- Mm-hmm.

514
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:29,040
Well, it's a little late,

515
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:32,586
and, you know,
I'm a little wobbly from the wine.

516
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,922
You said you could hold your alcohol.

517
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:38,508
Besides, we leave tomorrow.

518
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,429
Okay, sure.

519
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:43,680
Great.

520
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:49,060
(playing "Granada")

521
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:44,074
That was, uh...
that was unbelievable.

522
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,492
Thank you. Thank you.

523
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:48,995
I was looking at your face,
and you looked very moved.

524
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,080
Yes, yes.

525
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:52,165
A few times I saw a look like that.

526
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,918
Right, and on Maria Elena, I'm sure.

527
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,795
Well, yes, maybe on Maria Elena,

528
00:29:56,879 --> 00:30:01,007
when she saw or heard
something that moved her, yes.

529
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:02,926
You...

530
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,928
You're still in love with her.

531
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:08,640
No, I'm not. I'm not.

532
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,934
Mmm, that confirms it.

533
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,561
No, she will always
be a part of me,

534
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:16,398
and she's
an important person in my life,

535
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:21,069
but for the two of us,
something was not working.

536
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:24,030
What element?

537
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:25,949
We never found out.

538
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:31,371
(mumbles)

539
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:36,626
You said you were looking at my face.

540
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:38,920
Why?

541
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:41,047
Why were you looking at mine?

542
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:42,382
Was I?

543
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,509
You probably saw my tears.

544
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,635
Yes.

545
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:47,971
Yeah, um...

546
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,015
I'm a little out of control.

547
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:53,685
I was looking at your face
because I find it very beautiful.

548
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,103
You do?

549
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,646
Of course I do.

550
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:00,316
Of course I do,
and you know I do.

551
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:02,402
##

552
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,100
On the trip home, Vicky,

553
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:37,312
who had mentioned nothing
to Cristina, was silent.

554
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,481
Cristina, on the other hand,
talked nervously.

555
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:43,610
I must apologize to both of you
for ruining the whole weekend!

556
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:46,863
I'm completely mortified.
I'm humiliated.

557
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:49,783
I don't know whether it was the wine...
it could've been the shellfish.

558
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,868
Because, you know,
I have this ulcer,

559
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:56,164
and I just thank God you knew
enough sights to keep Vicky occupied.

560
00:31:56,248 --> 00:32:00,126
You know, I had these horrible nightmares
that you two would be like oil and water,

561
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:02,462
hating every minute
of being together.

562
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,547
I just couldn't move.

563
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:09,594
Vicky buried herself in work
at the library.

564
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:13,598
She put foolish ideas out of her head
and concentrated on her thesis,

565
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,851
but she found her thoughts
frequently returning to Oviedo.

566
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:22,065
Cristina, searching for
a means of self-expression,

567
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,234
wandered the streets
of Barcelona,

568
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:27,278
experimented with
her latest passion, photography,

569
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:29,697
and believed that she
had made a fool of herself

570
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:32,158
exactly at the moment of truth
with Juan Antonio.

571
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,203
And then, 48 hours later,

572
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,330
Cristina came to Vicky
with an announcement.

573
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:38,915
Vicky, he called.

574
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:40,834
Hmm, what? Who?

575
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:43,586
Juan Antonio.
He called me just now.

576
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,672
Juan Antonio called you?

577
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:48,716
Yeah. He wants to see me,
take me to some vineyard,

578
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,343
some wine tasting or something.

579
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,594
I said absolutely.

580
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,471
A wine tasting?

581
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:56,558
But... what about your ulcer?

582
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:59,435
Oh, no, no, it's fine.
A little wine's not going to hurt me.

583
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,187
The point is that he wants to see me.

584
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:02,605
Isn't that great?

585
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,357
- Yeah, yeah.
- I can't believe it!

586
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,109
I never thought he was gonna call.

587
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:10,029
That's great.
I'm happy for you.

588
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:14,868
That night, the two women
had trouble falling asleep.

589
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:17,620
Cristina sat in the kitchen
drinking coffee

590
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:19,664
and working on her poetry.

591
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,791
##

592
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,295
Vicky, too, was lost
in memories of a night

593
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:28,089
that now seemed
more and more unreal.

594
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:35,221
(cell phone rings)

595
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:42,854
Hello?

596
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,690
Hey, babe.
Did I wake you?

597
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:47,859
No. No, no, no.

598
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,486
I was just going to sleep.

599
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,280
I'm sorry I called so late.

600
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:55,366
I had to get out of the office,
get some air and get some coffee,

601
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:57,160
and I had this great idea.

602
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:58,745
Check this out.

603
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:01,497
Dad has contacts
in the American embassy in Spain, right?

604
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:04,292
I thought I could come early,
work from there on my computer,

605
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,628
and the two of us
could get married in Barcelona.

606
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,254
You said it was a romantic spot.

607
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,423
You know, we'll just do
a quick city hall-type thing.

608
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,091
'Course we'll do it
all over again in New York.

609
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,177
We'll have a huge blowout
for our families and friends,

610
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,845
but I thought it'd be fun.
What do you think?

611
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:18,723
What... to get married here?

612
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:19,807
Yeah, why not?

613
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:21,935
It'd be great to tell our kids
we married in Spain.

614
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:24,562
Dad's friends would make it
real easy for us.

615
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:28,608
Oh, I don't know what to say.

616
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:31,694
You don't sound bowled over.

617
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:34,364
No, it's, uh...

618
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:36,699
It's just a surprise.

619
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:39,410
So? Look, we're gonna marry
in the fall anyway,

620
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:41,371
and we're gonna
do that too, I promise.

621
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:43,248
Yeah, so what's the point?

622
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:45,583
The point is it's different,
it's exciting.

623
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:47,460
I told the idea to Ken and Alice.

624
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,525
They said they wished
they'd done it...

625
00:34:49,526 --> 00:34:51,506
I mean, you know, in
London in their case...

626
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,091
but they were excited.

627
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,551
Well, I-I...

628
00:34:57,221 --> 00:35:00,014
You sound a bit reluctant.

629
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:01,891
Me? No.

630
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:04,560
Why would I... why would I be?

631
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,563
No, I...

632
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:11,109
I think it's a fine idea.

633
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:13,569
I think it's great... it's a great idea.

634
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:16,281
Yeah. Yeah, no, I think
it's gonna be good.

635
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:18,533
Listen, I'm gonna call you tomorrow.
I know I woke you up.

636
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,869
I'll give you more details tomorrow.
I love you so much.

637
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:27,875

("La Ley del Retiro"
by Giulia y Los Tellarini plays)

640
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:59,282
Juan Antonio took Cristina
to a wine tasting.

641
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:02,076
After, he took her back
to his house,

642
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:05,204
a lovely place he had purchased
from another painter years ago

643
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:08,249
and which served
as his home and his studio.

644
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:10,293
He showed her his work,
which delighted her.

645
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:13,629
She loved the colors
and the wild, emotional way

646
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:15,840
he applied the paint
to the canvases.

647
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:18,968
From there, it was
only one floor up to his bedroom.

648
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,430
He told her of his marriage
to Maria Elena

649
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,600
and their deep love
and their terrible fights.

650
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,353
He told Cristina he had not wanted
to make love with anyone else

651
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:30,772
in the bedroom they shared till now.

652
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:33,733
This time, Cristina kept her food down.

653
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:28,746
Juan took Cristina out
several more times.

654
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:31,958
They went to see a new sculpture
by a friend of his.

655
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,585
##

656
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,796
He showed her some
of his favorite parts of the city,

657
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,965
where she took photographs.

658
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:41,259
Juan Antonio was friendly
with all the whores

659
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:43,511
and thought they would make
wonderful subjects.

660
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:53,312
He encouraged Cristina's work,

661
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:56,107
although she was always
too shy to allow him to see it.

662
00:37:57,985 --> 00:37:59,735
He took her to lunch
with his friends,

663
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,363
who were poets and artists
and musicians.

664
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:04,657
Cristina held her own quite well.

665
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:07,076
(indistinct conversation)

666
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:11,289
Meanwhile, one day,
going to study yet again the Park Güell,

667
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:12,665
which Gaudí had designed

668
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,209
and which figured
quite prominently in her thesis,

669
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:18,129
Vicky had a chance encounter.

670
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,219
- Vicky.
- Oh, hello.

671
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:27,346
- I mean, my goodness.
- How are you?

672
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:28,931
What are you doing here?

673
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:31,767
Nothing. Just doing some sketches.

674
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:33,686
Oh, right.

675
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:37,190
Well, I didn't mean to disturb you, so...

676
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:39,233
Disturb me, no.
How could you disturb me?

677
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:43,488
We never had a chance
to say a proper good-bye.

678
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:46,782
Oh, well, you could've called me.

679
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:50,244
I... yeah.

680
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:54,832
I debated it, but I didn't think
there was much point.

681
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:59,128
Yeah, but you never phoned,
not to say anything...

682
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:01,255
I mean, "Thank you, it was fun..."

683
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,884
I mean, you don't make love to someone
and then never call them

684
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:07,136
unless you were greatly disappointed.

685
00:39:07,221 --> 00:39:09,096
Quite the opposite.

686
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:12,600
But... you have plans to marry,

687
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,560
and I thought it best
to stop anything

688
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:17,480
before it led to
a bad situation for everyone.

689
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,732
Yeah, well, I'm only saying
that we made love,

690
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:22,026
and you seemed to drop off
the face of the earth.

691
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:27,073
I mean, I realize these things
don't mean much to you...

692
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:30,076
To pursue matters would have
only caused you anxiety,

693
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,453
and for me, a disappointment.

694
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:37,166
I had the ability to hurt you
after one night?

695
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:41,420
Maria Elena used to say that...

696
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:46,300
only unfulfilled love
can be romantic.

697
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:50,221
Right. Okay.

698
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:55,226
Well, the truth is,
you're much more suited to Cristina.

699
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:58,896
I've grown very fond of Cristina.

700
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:05,444
So, I'm very happy for you
and your husband-to-be.

701
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:10,199
And I... for you and Cristina.

702
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:12,201
Right.

703
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,537
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

704
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:19,834
And so the morning came

705
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,503
when Vicky's husband-to-be
arrived from New York.

706
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:25,047
("Barcelona" reprises)

707
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:35,141
Juan Antonio, like certain creative men,
needed always to live with a woman,

708
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:38,686
and had invited Cristina
to move in with him, which she accepted.

709
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:44,150
How much do I owe you?

710
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:48,738
(indistinct greetings)

711
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,917
- So you're with Global Enterprises?
- Yes!

712
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:03,377
Tom Sutter's an old friend of mine.

713
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,254
Oh, you know Tom Sutter!
We play golf.

714
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:06,339
- You do?
- Yeah.

715
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:08,132
I got some stories.
Tom has never beaten me.

716
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,426
Oh, well, he's not
the greatest player in the world...

717
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,358
(sighs)

718
00:41:25,442 --> 00:41:26,901
My God.

719
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,820
You're a whole different person here.

720
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:31,947
VICKY: What does that mean?

721
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:34,492
You were so into it.

722
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:37,203
Well, am I not usually?

723
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:39,997
(stuttering) Yeah, no, of course you are...

724
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:42,458
I'm giving you a compliment.

725
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:47,630
Maybe it's the Barcelona air.

726
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:50,800
Come here, hold me.
Hold me.

727
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,222
- You okay?
- Yeah.

728
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:58,265
Yeah.

729
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,518
How's Cristina doing?

730
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:03,437
Oh, you know, she's already
moved in with some guy.

731
00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:05,564
That was quick.
Don't tell me he's a bullfighter.

732
00:42:05,649 --> 00:42:06,649
No...

733
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,317
Writer? Composer?

734
00:42:08,402 --> 00:42:11,153
Tortured pseudo-intellectual
and self-destructive?

735
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:13,114
Yeah, I know, sometimes
she gets on my nerves

736
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:15,700
with her crackpot love affairs.

737
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:18,869
Look, I love her
because she's your friend,

738
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:20,538
but I often warn you about her.

739
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:22,289
She's an unhappy person.

740
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:25,376
She can't part with
that self-image she has

741
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,963
of the oh-so-special woman,
the artist trying to find herself.

742
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:32,299
I find her contempt
for normal values pretentious.

743
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:34,260
It's boring, cliché.

744
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:35,636
Yeah, well, men like her.

745
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:37,638
Well, she's pretty...

746
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:40,975
and not exactly difficult
to maneuver into the sack.

747
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,811
Now, you... on the other hand,

748
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:45,896
took a little effort to get to bed.

749
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:47,106
(laughs)

750
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,441
Hey.

751
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:50,109
But it was worth the struggle.

752
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:51,610
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

753
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:57,199
So, Juan Antonio wants to take me

754
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:59,827
to this old amusement park
that he said I would love,

755
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,705
and I thought
that we could just get lunch,

756
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:06,417
all of us, and then
we could all see it together.

757
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,294
What, tomorrow for lunch?

758
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:10,212
We can't. We have plans.

759
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:11,964
Oh, no, no, no. I'd...

760
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,300
No, we can always go boating
with Mark and Judy.

761
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:16,635
I'd like to go with Cristina
and Juan Antonio.

762
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,055
- I really want to go boating.
- Yeah, that would be great.

763
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,308
- Tomorrow. Okay.
- Okay.

764
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:24,351
##

765
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:25,936
The two couples met for lunch,

766
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:29,231
and during the course of conversation,
an awkward moment occurred.

767
00:43:30,901 --> 00:43:33,486
Juan Antonio, having
warm thoughts about Cristina,

768
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,988
tried to brush his foot
against hers under the table

769
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:38,407
and accidentally brushed Vicky's.

770
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:48,793
The amusement park was everything
Juan Antonio led them to believe.

771
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:52,129
It was antique and charming,
and overlooked all of Barcelona.

772
00:43:52,214 --> 00:43:55,925
##

773
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:16,695
JUAN ANTONIO: I see why you love
your fiancé, 'cause he's very charming.

774
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,489
Yes, yes. He's lovely.

775
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,324
And very well suited to you.

776
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,036
I don't think I like
the way you say that.

777
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,915
No, I only mean that you make
a comfortable couple in the best sense.

778
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:31,168
Look, you don't understand.
I can't do anything about it now.

779
00:44:31,253 --> 00:44:34,797
I'm not saying the thought
hasn't crossed my mind, but...

780
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:36,298
Vicky, please. Please, Vicky.

781
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:38,592
We must not get into
this conversation again, all right?

782
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:42,054
Things have moved on, and I've developed
real feelings for Cristina.

783
00:44:43,056 --> 00:44:44,390
Well, then, what did...

784
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:48,060
why did you rub your foot
against mine under the table?

785
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:51,480
- I didn't. I didn't.
- Yes, yes.

786
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:52,940
When I looked over at you.

787
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,608
Oh, no, if I did, it was a mistake.

788
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:58,070
I mean, my intention
was to touch Cristina.

789
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:02,700
Oh, okay. I-I... I'm sorry.

790
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:04,285
I apologize for my mistake.

791
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:06,078
Sorry, it was my mistake,
but listen...

792
00:45:06,162 --> 00:45:07,663
- No, I'm...
- Listen, listen.

793
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:11,458
You are all set to enter
a completely different life,

794
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:13,544
a life you always wanted
with a man you love.

795
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:14,920
Yes, goddamn it, I know!

796
00:45:15,005 --> 00:45:18,716
And then I met you and we had this
ridiculously irrational weekend together

797
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,552
and now I... now I don't know
where I am.

798
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:24,096
Please. I'm with Cristina,

799
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,641
and you're going to get married
in two weeks, Vicky.

800
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:29,518
- Yeah, I know.
- Okay?

801
00:45:29,603 --> 00:45:30,895
I know, you're right.

802
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:33,105
Cristina loves you.

803
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:34,732
I would never...

804
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:37,735
Yes, yes, and Cristina and I
are a good fit.

805
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,653
I mean we...
she speaks my language.

806
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:40,905
You and I... I don't know.

807
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:43,073
We'd be at each other's throats
in a month.

808
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:45,618
- Right?
- Yeah.

809
00:45:45,702 --> 00:45:50,039
Look, maybe our paths will cross again
someday under different circumstances.

810
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:52,041
I mean, who knows about life?

811
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:56,170
Yeah, you're right.
You're right, I'm an idiot.

812
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,213
I don't know what I expect to happen.

813
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:03,802
And so the wedding day came
and Vicky married Doug.

814
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:05,304
Cristina was there.

815
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:08,682
She did not bring Juan Antonio,
who made an excuse.

816
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:12,519
Following the ceremony,
the bride and groom

817
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:14,897
left for a mini-honeymoon in Seville.

818
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:16,982
##

819
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:24,865
Meanwhile, Cristina began
to sense the possibility

820
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,326
of the kind of relationship
she had always sought,

821
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,453
but in the past had eluded her.

822
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:34,667
She was the lover of an exciting man,
an artist, whose work she believed in.

823
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,754
She was already thinking of herself
as a kind of expatriate,

824
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,798
not smothered
by what she believed to be

825
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:43,467
America's puritanical
and materialistic culture,

826
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,511
which she had little patience for.

827
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:49,515
She saw herself
more a European soul,

828
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,475
in tune with the thinkers and artists

829
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:56,313
she felt expressed her tragic,
romantic, freethinking view of life.

830
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:10,786
With Juan Antonio's circle of friends,

831
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,872
she hobnobbed
with creative people of all sorts.

832
00:47:13,957 --> 00:47:15,290
She loved their company,

833
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:18,752
and continued to experiment
with writing and taking pictures.

834
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:36,937
You had a good time?

835
00:47:37,022 --> 00:47:39,565
Yeah, Seville is breathtaking.

836
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:40,983
We ran into some friends
from New York.

837
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:43,402
Had a chance to spend some time
with them, which was great.

838
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:44,570
A little too much time.

839
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:47,239
You're just angry because
they beat our brains out at bridge.

840
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:49,241
- Well, I don't like bridge.
- I don't, either.

841
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:50,909
- What is this?
- MARK: A little swag, here.

842
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:52,244
Attention, please.

843
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:54,747
Cristina and Juan Antonio
sent you this wedding gift.

844
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:57,332
JUDY: When I found out that she
was seriously dating Juan Antonio,

845
00:47:57,417 --> 00:47:58,667
I couldn't believe it. I...

846
00:47:58,752 --> 00:48:01,086
Just what we need...
a Rorschach blot.

847
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:03,881
You know, I don't think I like it.

848
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:05,924
- We'll buy you one of Alejandro's.
- This you will.

849
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:09,678
(phone rings)

850
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:14,475
(rings)

851
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:19,480
(rings)

852
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:21,440
(object drops)

853
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:23,025
(Cristina moans)

854
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:24,610
(phone rings)

855
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:28,781
Sí?

856
00:48:30,492 --> 00:48:31,658
Sí.

857
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,375
Uh, ¿cómo está?

858
00:48:44,214 --> 00:48:46,507
(continues conversation in Spanish)

859
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:57,351
What?

860
00:48:57,435 --> 00:49:00,854
Maria Elena... (speaks Spanish)
She tried to kill herself.

861
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:03,524
What? Is she okay?

862
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:06,443
Uh...

863
00:49:06,528 --> 00:49:08,737
Yes. I don't...
Yes, I think so. I don't know.

864
00:49:08,822 --> 00:49:09,863
I have to go.

865
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:11,031
Where are you going?

866
00:49:11,116 --> 00:49:12,991
Uh...

867
00:49:13,076 --> 00:49:15,077
I'm going to the hospital.

868
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:17,204
Should I come with you?

869
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:20,415
No, no, I don't think that
would be a good idea for her.

870
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,709
- She's a mess.
- Well, all right.

871
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:25,796
- Call me if you want me to come, okay?
- Okay, of course.

872
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,089
Of course.

873
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:30,926
Juan Antonio hurried out
in the dead of night.

874
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:39,852
Cristina tried to go back to sleep,
but had an uneasy feeling.

875
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:44,106
She dozed restively,
but awoke at the darkest hour.

876
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:53,323
(door opens)

877
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:56,076
CRISTINA: I'm just up here making coffee.

878
00:49:56,161 --> 00:49:57,953
Is everything okay?

879
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:01,665
Okay... Cristina, this is Maria Elena.

880
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:04,918
(Maria Elena sighs)

881
00:50:05,003 --> 00:50:06,253
(softly) Oh.

882
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:11,466
Here you have to speak English.

883
00:50:11,551 --> 00:50:13,760
- Please.
- I'm embarrassed.

884
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:17,848
Oh, no...
Please, don't feel embarrassed.

885
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,808
Can I get you anything at all?

886
00:50:19,893 --> 00:50:21,894
- Vodka.
- JUAN ANTONIO: Vodka?

887
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:33,572
In English, in English.

888
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:36,742
Maria Elena, when you are here,
you have to speak English, all right?

889
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:39,703
You want to take a shower,
you go there, in the guestroom.

890
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:43,373
(Maria Elena speaks Spanish)

891
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:44,958
JUAN ANTONIO: Sí, you're a guest.

892
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,762
- So... what's going on?
- Nothing.

893
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:59,514
- What? Is everything okay?
- Nothing.

894
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,183
I think she's okay, yeah.

895
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,811
I mean, there are...

896
00:51:06,189 --> 00:51:09,524
Things didn't work out
for her in Madrid,

897
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:12,444
and... she came bus...

898
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:15,197
she came back on the bus
tonight alone.

899
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:21,286
Her whole world looked black
and all her plans had come to nothing,

900
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:24,289
and she overdosed in the bus terminal.

901
00:51:24,374 --> 00:51:25,999
Oh, my God, that's terrible.

902
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:27,709
Yeah, she has to stay with us.

903
00:51:27,794 --> 00:51:29,753
What? She's gonna stay with us?

904
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:30,879
She has to stay with us.

905
00:51:30,964 --> 00:51:34,049
I mean, she has no money,
she has no one capable of caring for her...

906
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:38,220
I mean, I-I always...

907
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:42,849
I was always her connection
to the real life.

908
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:47,187
Uh-huh, I understand, but I mean,
how can she stay here?

909
00:51:47,272 --> 00:51:49,314
You know, I think...

910
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:52,734
I think that she can't be trusted
to stay alone, that's the problem.

911
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:55,487
Because, I mean, even if...
let me think...

912
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:59,866
even if I... if a place
could be worked out...

913
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:01,994
Well, maybe she needs
psychiatric help.

914
00:52:02,078 --> 00:52:04,663
No, she's always had
bad experiences with doctors.

915
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:07,666
I understand,
but where is she gonna stay?

916
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:08,959
In there.

917
00:52:11,004 --> 00:52:13,046
How long is she gonna stay here?

918
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,799
Cristina, I know...

919
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,720
- this is not what you had in mind.
- No... I understand.

920
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:21,847
But she has to stay with us.
She has no one else.

921
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:23,682
I understand.
It's only for a short time.

922
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,434
Yes, a few months at most.

923
00:52:25,518 --> 00:52:27,644
She's staying for a few months?

924
00:52:27,729 --> 00:52:29,980
Listen, I've been through this
with her before.

925
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:33,692
So... I mean if...

926
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:35,027
Shit.

927
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:37,529
(curses in Spanish)

928
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:40,532
If you had only known her
when I first met her.

929
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:42,075
I mean, her beauty...

930
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,329
- Her beauty took your breath away.
- Yes, I...

931
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:47,706
And she was so talented,
she was so brilliant,

932
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,082
she was so sensual,

933
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:53,170
and she chose me from
a hundred men ready to kill for her.

934
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:54,379
Uh-huh.

935
00:52:54,464 --> 00:52:58,300
We were both sure
that our relation was perfect,

936
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:00,469
but there was something
missing, you know?

937
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:03,638
Like, love requires
such a perfect balance.

938
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:05,140
It's like the human body.

939
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:09,144
It may turn that you have
all the vitamins and minerals,

940
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:15,525
but if there is a minor, single,
tiny ingredient missing,

941
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:18,737
like... like... like... like... like salt,

942
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,740
for example, one dies.

943
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:23,617
Salt?

944
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,912
(Maria Elena speaks Spanish)

945
00:53:29,332 --> 00:53:31,333
She's the woman I live with,

946
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:37,005
and you have to speak English
around here, please.

947
00:53:38,174 --> 00:53:40,926
Yes, exactly, out of courtesy.

948
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:51,770
You always had paranoid ideas
about every woman I've ever known.

949
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:55,190
- (scoffs)
- JUAN ANTONIO: Sí.

950
00:53:57,527 --> 00:54:02,239
Well, she's quite intelligent,
and she's a freethinker, like you.

951
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:03,907
- Like me?
- Yes.

952
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:24,469
Please... please, here,
in this house, speak English.

953
00:54:24,554 --> 00:54:25,929
That's all I ask, all right?

954
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:29,391
- Why are you getting so angry at me?
- Why in the world...

955
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:31,643
- Why are you getting so angry at me?
- Why? Listen.

956
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:34,229
Listen, why were you thinking
about killing yourself?

957
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:37,315
I mean, what a stupid idea
did cross on your mind!

958
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,068
I mean, try to kill yourself,
for Christ's sake!

959
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,071
Stay here
until you get back on your feet,

960
00:54:43,156 --> 00:54:46,199
and then, I beg you, please,
get out of my life.

961
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,371
You're too damaged.

962
00:54:51,456 --> 00:54:53,623
- And you love that.
- (Juan Antonio scoffs)

963
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,801
Speak English!

964
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:08,138
I don't like her for you!
I don't trust her.

965
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:10,682
And you know I always
have your best interests.

966
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:14,144
(scoffs) Well, not when
you tried to kill me.

967
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:15,729
- Oh, that.
- Yeah, that.

968
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:17,564
That small detail, yes.

969
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,858
(stutters in Spanish) You...

970
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:24,112
You are suspicious of her
because she is now my lover.

971
00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:25,572
I mean, it's so obvious.

972
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:58,855
More coffee?

973
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,273
Yes, please.

974
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,069
I'm sorry.

975
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:05,403
It's okay.

976
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:07,239
Here. Sugar.

977
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:08,740
No, thank you.

978
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:14,579
I thought we could go
for a ride to the countryside later.

979
00:56:14,664 --> 00:56:17,499
I mean, the weather is beautiful.

980
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:21,336
(speaks Spanish)

981
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,879
In English.

982
00:56:22,964 --> 00:56:24,881
Oh, no, it's fine.

983
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:27,634
You speak no Spanish?

984
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:30,554
No. I, uh, studied Chinese.

985
00:56:31,973 --> 00:56:33,223
Chinese?

986
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,227
Why?

987
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,354
I thought it sounded pretty.

988
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:42,399
Say something in Chinese.

989
00:56:44,193 --> 00:56:45,485
Me?

990
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:47,654
Mm-hmm.

991
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:51,575
Um... ni hao ma.

992
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:54,703
You think that sounds pretty?

993
00:56:56,122 --> 00:56:58,999
Well, maybe not the way
I'm pronouncing it, of course, but...

994
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,292
(chuckles)

995
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:07,090
Speak English, Maria Elena.

996
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:13,722
Speak English.

997
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:15,348
(indistinct; ashtray clanks)

998
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:18,184
I'm sorry. I'm nervous today.
I had bad dreams.

999
00:57:21,689 --> 00:57:23,189
Would you like to paint?

1000
00:57:23,274 --> 00:57:24,941
Oh, do you paint also?

1001
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:28,111
Ask him. Ask him.

1002
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:31,364
He stole everything from me,
his whole style.

1003
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:33,700
She likes to make up these stories.

1004
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:36,202
Antonio, your whole way
of seeing is mine.

1005
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:38,455
JUAN ANTONIO: I'm not saying
that you were not influential.

1006
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:41,249
- Influential? Influential?
- Yes. Yes, influential.

1007
00:57:41,334 --> 00:57:43,543
But to say that I stole your style...

1008
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:46,046
To say that I stole your style
is too delusional.

1009
00:57:56,307 --> 00:58:00,143
She always had problems with reality,
and I'm not going to get angry.

1010
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:01,895
I'm not going to get angry.

1011
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:03,605
Okay, what did they say
in art school?

1012
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:05,440
They said I was a genius, right?

1013
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:07,525
I'm always... I always
encouraged your talent.

1014
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:11,446
Not talent. I'm not talking about talent.
I said genius. Genius.

1015
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:14,115
I came close to killing for you.

1016
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,785
Yeah, you came close
to killing me with that chair.

1017
00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:18,745
I was defending myself,

1018
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:21,331
and you had a razor,
and you were drunk,

1019
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,208
with a razor and raging!

1020
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,255
- JUAN ANTONIO: Never.
- Sí, sí, sí.

1021
00:58:31,676 --> 00:58:33,176
You wanted to kill me for looking?

1022
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:40,225
I see you with someone else now,
and I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm civil.

1023
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:41,810
What else do you want?

1024
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:44,396
##

1025
00:58:56,617 --> 00:58:57,909
As the days passed,

1026
00:58:57,993 --> 00:59:00,912
Cristina observed Maria Elena
and Juan Antonio

1027
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:03,581
and found the heart
more puzzling than ever.

1028
00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:16,803
Where were you?
Were you working?

1029
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:19,097
- Yeah, I was trying to.
- Okay.

1030
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:22,976
I'm so curious, does she really think
that you stole from her?

1031
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,394
Uh...

1032
00:59:25,688 --> 00:59:31,735
Well, um, I guess I took
more from her than I'd like to admit, yes.

1033
00:59:32,737 --> 00:59:36,406
That's why I'm always so sensitive
when she brings it up.

1034
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:41,161
- I feel kind of sad.
- Why?

1035
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:43,496
'Cause I feel like
I'm never gonna be able to...

1036
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:47,667
to influence you
or inspire you in any way.

1037
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:48,793
No, that's not true.

1038
00:59:48,878 --> 00:59:50,086
That's how I feel.

1039
00:59:50,171 --> 00:59:51,171
That's not true.

1040
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:52,338
No, that's not true.

1041
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:55,091
I never heard the Scriab...
the Scriabin?

1042
00:59:55,176 --> 00:59:56,551
- Yeah.
- Piano Sonata?

1043
00:59:56,635 --> 01:00:00,138
Until you played those recordings for me,
and now I can't stop listening to them.

1044
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:01,556
- No?
- No.

1045
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,559
Well, that... makes me happy.

1046
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:07,228
CRISTINA: What?

1047
01:00:07,313 --> 01:00:10,815
Maybe it's not a good idea here.

1048
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,150
What?

1049
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:15,028
I mean, she's been better lately.

1050
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:18,698
I don't want to... upset her.

1051
01:00:19,742 --> 01:00:21,701
Of course. No. Okay.

1052
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:30,251
It was at Vicky's afternoon language class,

1053
01:00:30,336 --> 01:00:33,213
which she took several days a week
to improve her Spanish,

1054
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:35,215
that she met Ben, a young man

1055
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:38,927
who couldn't stop noticing her
and started to chat her up each day.

1056
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:42,472
Yeah, I can't believe
they hired me at the consulate,

1057
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:45,558
because my Spanish
is less than perfect, to say the least.

1058
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:47,852
No, I think it's good. It's good.

1059
01:00:47,937 --> 01:00:49,187
It's all right.

1060
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:52,023
Are you enjoying
your time in Barcelona?

1061
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:54,818
Um, I would if I had more friends.

1062
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:55,985
Right.

1063
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:59,280
Yesterday I walked from the beach
up to Park Güell in search of Gaudí.

1064
01:01:00,783 --> 01:01:02,784
Hey, you want to see a movie?

1065
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:04,410
- A movie?
- Wednesday?

1066
01:01:04,495 --> 01:01:05,829
Afternoon?

1067
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:06,913
Uh.

1068
01:01:08,249 --> 01:01:09,624
Yeah.

1069
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:12,377
The movie was a great success,

1070
01:01:12,461 --> 01:01:15,129
and Ben proved to be
very good company for Vicky.

1071
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:22,095
One afternoon, they ducked
into a store to buy some cherries,

1072
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,597
and when the storekeeper
took a phone call in the back,

1073
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:26,641
he couldn't resist taking her hand.

1074
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,561
Uh.

1075
01:01:29,645 --> 01:01:31,896
Uh, no, don't.

1076
01:01:31,981 --> 01:01:32,981
No?

1077
01:01:33,983 --> 01:01:35,149
No...

1078
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:38,987
You do know
that I'm recently married?

1079
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:40,363
BEN: Yeah.

1080
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:44,701
I guess I was under the impression
that maybe you jumped into it too quick,

1081
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:48,663
- maybe you regret it...
- Regr... ha... have I implied that?

1082
01:01:49,665 --> 01:01:51,583
Unless I read into it.

1083
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:52,834
No, I...

1084
01:01:53,836 --> 01:01:55,670
I shouldn't tell you this. I...

1085
01:01:56,881 --> 01:02:00,425
You know what, I was always someone
who thought I knew exactly what I wanted.

1086
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:02,385
BEN: But you didn't.

1087
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:05,013
Well, no, I met somebody else,

1088
01:02:05,097 --> 01:02:09,017
and I'm not gonna get into that story.

1089
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:10,768
BEN: So, this guy you met...?

1090
01:02:10,853 --> 01:02:14,439
The guy is living with my best friend.

1091
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:16,608
You know, what am I talking about?

1092
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:20,862
When I... when I hear myself,
it's just... it's just crazy.

1093
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:24,782
I just married the guy I wanted.

1094
01:02:24,867 --> 01:02:25,992
BEN: Did you?

1095
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:27,368
I thought so.

1096
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:31,039
BEN: So? What happened?

1097
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:36,210
One goddamn weekend in Oviedo.

1098
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:39,422
##

1099
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:44,177
Cristina, Juan Antonio, and Maria Elena
went riding in the country.

1100
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:47,013
Maria Elena had decided
they would all cook a big dinner together,

1101
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:49,474
and she insisted
they pick fresh blackberries.

1102
01:02:49,558 --> 01:02:50,725
MARIA ELENA: Wait for me!

1103
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:54,562
Gives me vertigo!

1104
01:02:56,231 --> 01:02:57,398
(whoos)

1105
01:02:58,192 --> 01:02:59,859
- This is the perfect...
- Here, like that.

1106
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:00,944
- Okay.
- Like that.

1107
01:03:01,028 --> 01:03:02,320
Can you get some... there.

1108
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:04,822
- Ow, ow!
- What's wrong? What's...

1109
01:03:04,907 --> 01:03:06,324
What, what, what?

1110
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:07,533
What happened?

1111
01:03:07,618 --> 01:03:10,495
Wait, no, sit down.
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

1112
01:03:11,914 --> 01:03:14,082
Is it your upper or your lower?

1113
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:15,625
- Here.
- Here?

1114
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,585
- Yep.
- Hold on, wait.

1115
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:20,171
- Ow.
- Let me... oh, oh, oh.

1116
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:21,506
Here, let me...

1117
01:03:25,594 --> 01:03:27,303
- You want some aspirin?
- Yeah.

1118
01:03:27,388 --> 01:03:29,013
I have aspirin in my bag.

1119
01:03:29,098 --> 01:03:30,223
- All right.
- Okay.

1120
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:32,225
You relax. I'll be right back.

1121
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:54,288
(Juan Antonio and Maria Elena chatting)

1122
01:03:54,373 --> 01:03:57,417
(Juan Antonio sighing in relief)

1123
01:03:57,501 --> 01:04:00,962
It's all in his head.
He has so much tension.

1124
01:04:01,964 --> 01:04:04,382
To the world,
he's carefree, nothing matters,

1125
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:06,968
"life is short and with no purpose"
kind of thing,

1126
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:10,680
but all his fear
just goes to his head.

1127
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:14,475
(both speaking Spanish)

1128
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:18,354
You know, she plays piano?

1129
01:04:19,732 --> 01:04:22,483
No, I didn't know.

1130
01:04:22,568 --> 01:04:24,652
Is that why you have
a piano in your house?

1131
01:04:24,737 --> 01:04:26,904
No, I could have been
a concert pianist.

1132
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:28,239
Yeah, she could have.

1133
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:30,950
I mean, no one plays
a Scarlatti like Maria Elena.

1134
01:04:31,035 --> 01:04:34,162
She understands Scarlatti,
am I right?

1135
01:04:35,164 --> 01:04:36,789
Do you play music?

1136
01:04:36,874 --> 01:04:42,253
No, I just have to come face-to-face
with the fact that I am not gifted.

1137
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:46,674
You know, I can appreciate art
and I love music, but...

1138
01:04:46,759 --> 01:04:48,009
It's sad, really,

1139
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:51,262
because I feel like I have
a lot to express

1140
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:53,639
and I am not gifted.

1141
01:04:53,724 --> 01:04:55,558
But you do have talent.

1142
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,727
- No.
- Yes.

1143
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:59,729
What's my talent?

1144
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:01,814
You take beautiful photographs.

1145
01:05:01,899 --> 01:05:05,151
That's true. She always takes pictures
that she hides from me.

1146
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:06,527
That's...

1147
01:05:06,612 --> 01:05:08,821
No, that's because they're nothing.

1148
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:10,823
How do you know I take pictures?

1149
01:05:10,908 --> 01:05:12,909
I found them in your luggage.

1150
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:15,161
You went through my luggage?

1151
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,163
Of course I went through your luggage!

1152
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:19,582
First night I was in the house.
I didn't trust you.

1153
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:22,710
I didn't believe you were
who you said you were.

1154
01:05:22,795 --> 01:05:26,547
I wanted to know who was
really sharing the bed of my ex-husband.

1155
01:05:26,632 --> 01:05:28,341
What?!

1156
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:29,926
Who knew what I would find there?

1157
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:32,345
How could I be sure
you were not going to hurt me?

1158
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:34,806
After all, I had thoughts of killing you.

1159
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:37,767
##

1160
01:05:42,064 --> 01:05:45,358
So here's a few more.

1161
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:49,028
Don't say you like them
if you don't like them.

1162
01:05:49,113 --> 01:05:51,656
- What are you talking about?
- They are beautiful!

1163
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,533
- Yeah, you see?
- Look at this!

1164
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:57,829
The next day, Maria Elena
went out photographing with Cristina.

1165
01:05:57,913 --> 01:06:01,124
She had a superb eye and knew a lot
about the art of photography,

1166
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:03,126
and taught Cristina
much about the

1167
01:06:03,127 --> 01:06:05,044
aesthetics and subtleties
of picture taking.

1168
01:06:05,129 --> 01:06:07,338
She advised her
to get rid of her digital camera

1169
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:10,091
and use an old one
for more interesting results.

1170
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:12,218
She said it was important
to have a darkroom,

1171
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:14,470
and that she would set one up
in the basement for Cristina

1172
01:06:14,555 --> 01:06:18,015
and teach her various techniques
of developing her own pictures.

1173
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:25,815
They photographed everything,

1174
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:28,401
from silly-looking dogs
to grim-faced children...

1175
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:31,821
but the best subject
was Maria Elena herself.

1176
01:06:59,016 --> 01:07:01,767
Shopping one afternoon,
Vicky and Doug ran into

1177
01:07:01,852 --> 01:07:03,978
Adam Tabachnick and Sally.

1178
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:07,064
Adam was in the same business
Doug was in and they were friendly,

1179
01:07:07,149 --> 01:07:10,067
although in New York,
they did not spend a lot of time together.

1180
01:07:10,152 --> 01:07:11,861
(laughing) You guys have
gotta be kidding me!

1181
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,279
Hi, it's good to see you!

1182
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:16,115
Any program on TV,
obviously anything live,

1183
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,492
you can play it back
on your computer.

1184
01:07:18,577 --> 01:07:19,911
So I'm on a flight to Tokyo.

1185
01:07:19,995 --> 01:07:22,121
I'm 40,000 feet up in the air,

1186
01:07:22,206 --> 01:07:25,625
and I am watching the Mets,
live, on my laptop.

1187
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:27,585
It's amazing.
You're never out of touch.

1188
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:29,837
We're gonna have the new house
wired for everything.

1189
01:07:29,922 --> 01:07:33,132
I'm looking at those new Japanese
high-definition TV screens.

1190
01:07:33,217 --> 01:07:35,218
You've gotta have my guy
do your installation.

1191
01:07:35,302 --> 01:07:37,845
- He's just a genius with computers and...
- I'll get his card.

1192
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:40,223
We just did our place in Greenwich.
You have to see it!

1193
01:07:40,307 --> 01:07:43,643
We have this wonderful decorator
you should use.

1194
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:46,896
He's, um, he's creative,
but he knows when to back off.

1195
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:50,983
We did it, uh, modern, with just
a splash of antiques here and there.

1196
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:54,028
I love combining the two,
but God, the prices.

1197
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:57,281
Do you have any idea
what a good-sized oriental rug costs?

1198
01:07:57,366 --> 01:07:59,158
DOUG: She's right. She's right.

1199
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:03,454
Actually, there's an old joke.
"100,000 for a Persian rug..."

1200
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:05,539
##

1201
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:18,552
Life continued predictably
for Vicky and Doug,

1202
01:08:18,637 --> 01:08:22,306
until one afternoon,
when an unpredictable moment occurred.

1203
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:38,364
Several days later,
Judy asked Vicky to meet her privately,

1204
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,366
away from the house,
to have coffee.

1205
01:08:41,368 --> 01:08:43,077
What happened the other day...

1206
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:47,039
- I don't want you to get the wrong idea.
- Oh, no, no, no.

1207
01:08:47,124 --> 01:08:49,084
It's really none
of my business.

1208
01:08:49,085 --> 01:08:51,043
I'm not having an affair
with Mark's partner.

1209
01:08:51,128 --> 01:08:53,045
I'm... I'm not.

1210
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:55,131
No, I didn't think you were.

1211
01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:58,175
Mm, uh, not that
I haven't had fantasies

1212
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:03,097
of someone coming along
and taking me out of my situation,

1213
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:08,102
but the fantasies are not Jay Lewis...

1214
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:11,147
even though he would like that, he would.

1215
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:14,734
By "taking you out of your situation"...?

1216
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:21,866
I haven't... I haven't been in love
with Mark for years.

1217
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:26,037
I mean, I love him,
but I'm not in love with him.

1218
01:09:27,122 --> 01:09:28,831
I'm sorry to hear that.

1219
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:32,293
It's funny, I just made...

1220
01:09:33,545 --> 01:09:37,590
I just made the same speech
to my shrink. Huh.

1221
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:40,009
Well, what does your shrink say?

1222
01:09:41,887 --> 01:09:47,183
He says, um, that I'm
too frightened to act and that...

1223
01:09:48,352 --> 01:09:51,312
that I'm looking for some kind
of magical solution

1224
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:55,066
which is unrealistic, and that I...

1225
01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:58,110
And an affair is not the answer.

1226
01:09:58,195 --> 01:10:01,113
And I don't... I'm sorry to be
laying all of this on you,

1227
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:04,033
but I was so humiliated
when you saw us.

1228
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:05,618
- Look...
- I'm just...

1229
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:09,872
Look, you mustn't feel that you
have to explain yourself to me.

1230
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:11,332
I mean...

1231
01:10:13,085 --> 01:10:15,211
Mark is great.

1232
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:19,965
I'm sure any...

1233
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:24,929
any dissatisfaction I have
is my own problem.

1234
01:10:25,013 --> 01:10:26,889
I'm just...

1235
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:32,561
I can't leave him,
and I know that I never will.

1236
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,857
Hmm, why not?

1237
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,486
I just... I can't.

1238
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,738
I'm too scared.

1239
01:10:44,616 --> 01:10:47,243
The moment's passed.

1240
01:10:49,621 --> 01:10:51,622
##

1241
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,628
(indistinct greetings)

1242
01:11:05,053 --> 01:11:08,556
It's so apparent to me that you
and Juan Antonio are still in love

1243
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,891
when I see you together, you know?

1244
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:13,269
Our love will last forever.

1245
01:11:13,353 --> 01:11:15,438
It's forever, but it just doesn't work.

1246
01:11:15,522 --> 01:11:17,815
That's why it will always
be romantic,

1247
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:20,151
because it cannot be complete.

1248
01:11:20,235 --> 01:11:23,904
Maybe it can't be complete because,
you know, I'm getting in the way,

1249
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:25,865
- or I don't know, I feel like...
- No.

1250
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:29,910
Before you... before you,
we used to cause each other

1251
01:11:29,995 --> 01:11:31,745
so much pain, so much suffering.

1252
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:34,248
Without you, all this
would not be possible.

1253
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:36,959
You know why? Because you
are the missing ingredient.

1254
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:39,753
You are like the tint that,

1255
01:11:39,838 --> 01:11:42,298
added to a palette,
makes the color beautiful.

1256
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:46,093
Aren't you and Juan Antonio
tempted to make love?

1257
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:48,095
I feel like...

1258
01:11:49,097 --> 01:11:50,097
I don't know.

1259
01:11:50,182 --> 01:11:52,391
At the end of our marriage, we didn't,

1260
01:11:52,476 --> 01:11:55,227
but I have to say,
those feelings are coming back now,

1261
01:11:55,312 --> 01:11:57,146
thanks to you,

1262
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:59,815
in a new and deeper way.

1263
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,609
Well, I wouldn't be upset about it.

1264
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:04,653
I'd never want to get into the way.
It wouldn't upset me at all.

1265
01:12:04,738 --> 01:12:06,071
I know you wouldn't be upset,

1266
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:09,283
same way I get this warm feeling

1267
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:11,994
when I hear you both
locked in passion every night.

1268
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:15,915
I listen, and I'm happy.

1269
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:20,419
Was Cristina okay with it
when Maria Elena and Juan Antonio

1270
01:12:20,504 --> 01:12:22,421
made love one afternoon?

1271
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:26,091
Beforehand, she gave them both her
blessing, but then had mixed feelings.

1272
01:12:26,176 --> 01:12:29,762
She was not quite as open-minded
as she had always imagined herself,

1273
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:33,265
and the thought of the two of them
in bed and, inevitably, full of intensity,

1274
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:35,226
caused her some conflict.

1275
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:39,313
In the end, she gradually relaxed
and let herself go with the flow of things,

1276
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:41,273
a tolerance she was proud of.

1277
01:12:42,317 --> 01:12:44,109
At first it did bother me,

1278
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:47,655
but then I started to think about all these
standard, accepted clichés of love...

1279
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:49,073
what's right, what's wrong,

1280
01:12:49,157 --> 01:12:52,868
what's appropriate according
to the "appropriate police,"

1281
01:12:52,953 --> 01:12:55,329
and you know, you see
how screwed up most relation...

1282
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:57,289
So what you're saying is
you're sharing a man.

1283
01:12:57,374 --> 01:12:58,624
You're like a Mormon wife.

1284
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,584
I-I know it sounds strange,

1285
01:13:00,669 --> 01:13:02,795
but actually, we all contribute
to the relationship,

1286
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,213
and we're all really nourished by it.

1287
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:05,965
If everyone did that,
society couldn't function.

1288
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:07,216
- Come on!
- Come on, Doug.

1289
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,177
Let's not get into one of those
turgid categorical imperative arguments.

1290
01:13:10,262 --> 01:13:11,512
- Whatever works.
- Whatever works?

1291
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:14,098
Maria Elena believes that there are
many truths in life, not just one.

1292
01:13:14,182 --> 01:13:16,475
I don't know. I mean, babe,
could you live like that?

1293
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,104
Well, I never had Cristina's...

1294
01:13:20,188 --> 01:13:22,398
What, Cristina's lack of structure?

1295
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:23,899
It's very structured, actually.

1296
01:13:23,984 --> 01:13:25,484
Her courage.
I never had her courage.

1297
01:13:25,569 --> 01:13:26,735
Her courage?

1298
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:29,446
Courage? Next thing she'll be
going to bed with Maria Elena

1299
01:13:29,531 --> 01:13:34,076
and glorifying it as some kind
of superior, alternative lifestyle.

1300
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,703
Oh, I have gone to bed with her.

1301
01:13:35,787 --> 01:13:37,538
- No!
- Yeah.

1302
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:38,914
When?

1303
01:13:38,999 --> 01:13:43,085
Well, Juan Antonio and Maria Elena
made this darkroom for me...

1304
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:45,462
you know, they're both pushing me
to take photographs...

1305
01:13:45,547 --> 01:13:47,339
and actually, I'm getting pretty good.

1306
01:13:47,424 --> 01:13:50,175
Believe it or not,
I'm getting much more confident.

1307
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:52,803
CRISTINA: And we were down there
in the darkroom,

1308
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:56,640
and... I was just working on
some of my photographs,

1309
01:13:56,725 --> 01:14:00,519
things that, you know, I wouldn't
have done if she hadn't inspired me.

1310
01:14:00,604 --> 01:14:02,396
##

1311
01:15:05,085 --> 01:15:07,711
And it happened
very naturally for both of us.

1312
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:10,589
You weren't nervous?

1313
01:15:10,674 --> 01:15:14,510
No, no. It was very loving and gentle.

1314
01:15:14,594 --> 01:15:16,011
Did you enjoy it?

1315
01:15:16,096 --> 01:15:17,471
Mm-hmm, I did.

1316
01:15:18,765 --> 01:15:22,059
And... it was just the one time?

1317
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:23,310
Yeah, yeah.

1318
01:15:23,395 --> 01:15:25,187
I mean, it just happened, you know.

1319
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:29,149
I'm not planning on making
a habit out of it, necessarily.

1320
01:15:30,235 --> 01:15:33,195
But if you... enjoyed it...

1321
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:35,989
- I did, I did at the time.
- Well, did you tell Juan Antonio?

1322
01:15:36,074 --> 01:15:37,825
Yeah, of course.
There's nothing to hide.

1323
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:40,911
Would you say
then you are a bisexual?

1324
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:42,913
No, I see no reason
to label everything.

1325
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:44,498
I'm me, you know,

1326
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:48,877
and I've slept with Juan Antonio since
and enjoyed that experience very much.

1327
01:15:48,962 --> 01:15:51,338
It's a great story.

1328
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,884
Yeah, that's a great story.

1329
01:15:57,011 --> 01:16:00,347
Hey, look, I don't set
myself up as a judge, so...

1330
01:16:04,269 --> 01:16:05,894
What are you thinking?

1331
01:16:05,979 --> 01:16:08,063
Hmm?

1332
01:16:08,148 --> 01:16:09,773
I don't know.

1333
01:16:09,858 --> 01:16:12,443
How quickly time passes.

1334
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:14,987
Summer's almost over.

1335
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:17,406
We'll be going home soon.

1336
01:16:19,743 --> 01:16:22,953
I thought you were still dwelling
about your friend's

1337
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:25,539
little tale of lust in the darkroom.

1338
01:16:27,584 --> 01:16:30,043
And speaking of dark rooms...

1339
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:32,045
Come here.

1340
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:39,344
##

1341
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,490
Over the next weeks,

1342
01:16:59,574 --> 01:17:02,618
Cristina became more and more sure
of herself as a photographer.

1343
01:17:02,702 --> 01:17:06,371
Both Juan Antonio and Maria Elena
contributed ideas and support

1344
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:07,748
when she had doubts.

1345
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:09,333
Thanks to their encouragement,

1346
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:12,503
photography was becoming
a productive interest in her life.

1347
01:17:12,587 --> 01:17:17,883
By now, she and Juan Antonio
and Maria Elena had become lovers.

1348
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:34,107
Everything seemed perfectly balanced,
perfectly in tune.

1349
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:36,735
Maria Elena was calm and relaxed.

1350
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:41,573
Juan Antonio was going through
a very creative period with his painting.

1351
01:17:41,658 --> 01:17:45,369
It was only Cristina,
as the last days of summer expired,

1352
01:17:45,453 --> 01:17:48,330
who began to experience
an old familiar stirring,

1353
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:50,582
a growing restlessness
that she dreaded,

1354
01:17:50,667 --> 01:17:53,794
but recognized only too well.

1355
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:57,422
Suddenly, thoughts started
taking precedence over feelings,

1356
01:17:57,507 --> 01:18:00,175
thoughts and questions
about life and love,

1357
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:02,594
and as much as she tried
to resist these ideas,

1358
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:04,930
she could not get them
from her mind.

1359
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:08,308
Finally, summoning her resolve
one evening after dinner,

1360
01:18:08,393 --> 01:18:10,811
she made an announcement
that surprised everyone.

1361
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:12,646
I don't want what my parents had,

1362
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:15,232
I don't want what I had
before I came here...

1363
01:18:15,316 --> 01:18:19,403
I mean, I know that...
but I know I can't live like this forever.

1364
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:22,614
(both speaking Spanish)

1365
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,742
- What do you want, Cristina?
- I want something different.

1366
01:18:25,827 --> 01:18:27,119
- What?
- (sighs)

1367
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:29,288
I-I don't know.

1368
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:30,914
Not this.

1369
01:18:30,999 --> 01:18:35,377
There is no answer, Cristina.
There is no single answer.

1370
01:18:38,298 --> 01:18:41,091
CRISTINA: Please, don't get so upset.

1371
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:44,303
Please, and can you speak English?
I can't understand you.

1372
01:18:51,686 --> 01:18:54,104
(bangs counter)

1373
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:55,647
(sobbing)

1374
01:18:55,732 --> 01:18:57,983
Maria Elena, speak English, please,

1375
01:18:58,067 --> 01:18:59,735
so she can understand it, all right?

1376
01:19:02,989 --> 01:19:05,991
Chronic dissatisfaction,
that's what you have.

1377
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:08,243
Chronic dissatisfaction.

1378
01:19:08,328 --> 01:19:09,870
Big sickness.

1379
01:19:16,294 --> 01:19:17,669
Do you know how much we love you?

1380
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:19,796
And I love you both.

1381
01:19:19,881 --> 01:19:23,008
- No, you don't.
- Yes I... it has nothing to do with that.

1382
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:25,761
- Please, please!
- I just can't live...

1383
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:50,577
Where will you go, Cristina?

1384
01:19:50,662 --> 01:19:51,912
I, um...

1385
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:54,498
I just gotta get out of here
for a few weeks,

1386
01:19:54,582 --> 01:19:57,000
and I just gotta clear my head.

1387
01:19:57,085 --> 01:20:00,253
It's not... this is all my... problem.

1388
01:20:00,338 --> 01:20:01,838
It has nothing to do with you.

1389
01:20:01,923 --> 01:20:03,173
Then come here.

1390
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:06,927
Oy.

1391
01:20:07,011 --> 01:20:08,679
(kisses)

1392
01:20:08,763 --> 01:20:13,266
Let's be thankful
for all of the good times

1393
01:20:13,351 --> 01:20:16,645
that we've spent together,
all right, and...

1394
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:21,566
and remember each other
with respect,

1395
01:20:21,651 --> 01:20:24,403
all right, and love and affection.

1396
01:20:26,364 --> 01:20:27,364
All right?

1397
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:35,539
Cristina told
all that had happened to Vicky,

1398
01:20:35,623 --> 01:20:38,709
and said she was going to France
for a few weeks to think things out.

1399
01:20:38,793 --> 01:20:40,293
She would return to pick her up

1400
01:20:40,378 --> 01:20:42,546
so they could go back
to New York together.

1401
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:44,631
(indistinct)

1402
01:20:49,637 --> 01:20:51,888
JUDY: So it's been Juan Antonio
all this time?

1403
01:20:51,973 --> 01:20:55,183
VICKY: Look, I'm not gonna do anything.
Forget I said...

1404
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:58,270
I just needed to tell someone,
and we've become close, so...

1405
01:20:58,354 --> 01:21:00,439
- Why don't you act on it?
- What, act now?

1406
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:04,818
Break up with Doug?
He's really a sweet guy.

1407
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:06,945
He married me in good faith.

1408
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:10,532
For what?
For a bohemian Spanish painter

1409
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:13,243
with a passionate tie to an ex-wife

1410
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:17,205
who probably doesn't even
share my feelings, if he ever did,

1411
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:19,916
so... oh, God, who am I kidding?

1412
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:22,419
But the dream is exciting.

1413
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:24,921
If I were you,
I wouldn't waste another minute.

1414
01:21:25,006 --> 01:21:26,882
- I'd get on it.
- Get on what?

1415
01:21:26,966 --> 01:21:28,967
Well, you're in love with him. If...

1416
01:21:29,052 --> 01:21:34,222
Do something, or the years will pass by
and you will be sorry, Vicky.

1417
01:21:34,307 --> 01:21:36,224
No, no, what are you saying? I...

1418
01:21:36,309 --> 01:21:39,311
Look, I can't risk everything.

1419
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:42,355
If Juan Antonio had never existed,

1420
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:45,108
- I'd be fine with Doug.
- Just fine.

1421
01:21:45,193 --> 01:21:47,027
- Yeah, as I planned.
- Just fine?

1422
01:21:47,111 --> 01:21:49,071
How blunt do you want me to be?

1423
01:21:49,155 --> 01:21:52,240
When I look at Doug, I see Mark.

1424
01:21:52,325 --> 01:21:56,203
Yeah, well, you're using me
to rewrite your own history.

1425
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:58,872
Despite Vicky's protestations,

1426
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:02,751
Judy was possessed with finding a way
to bring her and Juan Antonio together,

1427
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:06,546
and prevailed upon her friend Gabriella,
who was a figure in the art world,

1428
01:22:06,631 --> 01:22:09,883
to throw a party and invite
Vicky and Juan Antonio.

1429
01:22:10,885 --> 01:22:13,762
Meanwhile, as predicted,
without Cristina

1430
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:16,348
the relationship between
Juan Antonio and Maria Elena

1431
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:18,308
had gone back
to its old destructiveness.

1432
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:21,728
(both screaming in Spanish)

1433
01:22:38,996 --> 01:22:41,164
As had happened before
by mutual consent,

1434
01:22:41,249 --> 01:22:44,793
Maria Elena packed her things
and moved out of Juan Antonio's house.

1435
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:52,551
##

1436
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,810
Yeah, I think he's sweet.
I mean, he owns...

1437
01:23:02,812 --> 01:23:05,147
- He gets in very close.
- Yeah, he does.

1438
01:23:05,231 --> 01:23:07,566
He's a close talker.
He's a close talker.

1439
01:23:09,152 --> 01:23:11,194
That's probably why he's so successful.

1440
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:15,907
I was telling her on the car ride
over here that I'm actually very excited.

1441
01:23:15,992 --> 01:23:18,118
I think he's gonna be a great contact.

1442
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:20,745
I'm gonna go check out the food.
Does anyone want anything?

1443
01:23:20,830 --> 01:23:21,872
- No.
- No.

1444
01:23:21,956 --> 01:23:23,165
Thank you.

1445
01:23:23,249 --> 01:23:25,375
But he gets in your face.

1446
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:27,460
No, no, I mean,
he'll get a little close...

1447
01:23:33,801 --> 01:23:35,051
JUAN ANTONIO: Hello.

1448
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:41,099
Oh... hello.

1449
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:43,143
I'm surprised to see you.

1450
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:47,731
As am I to see you.

1451
01:23:47,815 --> 01:23:49,566
I didn't think you liked parties.

1452
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:52,819
Yeah, well, Gabriella insisted I come,
and she's an old friend.

1453
01:23:54,322 --> 01:23:57,574
You know, of course, that Cristina
and I are no longer together, right?

1454
01:23:57,658 --> 01:23:58,909
Yes.

1455
01:23:58,993 --> 01:24:02,037
So now you're just
with your ex-wife?

1456
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:03,997
No, Maria Elena is gone, as well.

1457
01:24:04,081 --> 01:24:06,124
Oh. For now.

1458
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:10,503
It's funny. Maria Elena and I...

1459
01:24:10,588 --> 01:24:12,923
We are meant for each other
and not meant for each other.

1460
01:24:13,007 --> 01:24:15,383
It's... it's a contradiction.

1461
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:19,095
I mean, in order to understand it
you need a poet like my father...

1462
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:21,598
because I don't.

1463
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:25,352
Well...

1464
01:24:25,436 --> 01:24:26,895
How about you?

1465
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:28,772
All goes well
with your husband, I'm sure?

1466
01:24:28,856 --> 01:24:31,316
Oh, yes. Yes, he's wonderful.

1467
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,943
He's terrific.

1468
01:24:33,027 --> 01:24:35,946
I'm quite delighted with
the way things turned out.

1469
01:24:36,948 --> 01:24:39,199
Why don't I believe you?

1470
01:24:41,869 --> 01:24:43,870
Don't become flirtatious.

1471
01:24:43,955 --> 01:24:46,831
You know, I realize
your bed is empty now

1472
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:49,125
and you always had
a little yen for me,

1473
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:51,962
but we're preparing
to leave by the weekend, so...

1474
01:24:52,046 --> 01:24:53,672
Meet me for lunch.

1475
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:58,969
I'm too scared.

1476
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:02,847
DOUG: (on phone) No. What?

1477
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:05,600
You're breaking up, Tom.

1478
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:08,520
You're breaking up.

1479
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:09,938
Where are you?

1480
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,649
Okay, that's better.

1481
01:25:12,733 --> 01:25:14,818
That's better.
Just try to stand still.

1482
01:25:15,987 --> 01:25:17,487
Can you hear me?

1483
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:21,491
We have to get a bird
for Mark and Judy.

1484
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:23,368
No, we can't get them a bird.

1485
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:24,828
- Why not?
- It's ridiculous.

1486
01:25:24,912 --> 01:25:27,414
They're beautiful.
I always wanted a bird.

1487
01:25:27,498 --> 01:25:31,418
When we get home, I'd love to get,
like, a bird for the new house.

1488
01:25:31,502 --> 01:25:32,752
Yeah?

1489
01:25:32,837 --> 01:25:36,131
Yeah, and I'm leaning
towards Bedford Hills.

1490
01:25:36,215 --> 01:25:38,049
- What do you think?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1491
01:25:38,134 --> 01:25:40,260
- (cell phone rings)
- All right, well, hold on.

1492
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,430
Hello?

1493
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:45,932
Spend tomorrow afternoon with me.

1494
01:25:46,934 --> 01:25:49,144
- Oh, no, it's not possible.
- DOUG: Hey, buddy!

1495
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:51,396
We're preparing
to leave by the weekend.

1496
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:55,066
Be on the corner of Callee Tiles,
Tiles, in Pedrables,

1497
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:58,737
and I'll drive by
and I'll pick you up at noon.

1498
01:25:59,447 --> 01:26:02,157
Uh, no. You're wasting your time.

1499
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:03,867
I can't talk now.

1500
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:05,910
Look, I'm not the kind of man

1501
01:26:05,995 --> 01:26:09,080
who would try to come
between a husband and wife... I'm not.

1502
01:26:09,165 --> 01:26:13,376
I'm not, but Judy Nash called me
and she tells me that you are not happy,

1503
01:26:13,461 --> 01:26:17,088
that you are actually more in love
with me than the man you married.

1504
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:19,132
I can't talk.

1505
01:26:19,216 --> 01:26:20,216
(beeps off)

1506
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:29,476
This is nice.
Yeah. Really nice.

1507
01:26:31,479 --> 01:26:32,854
Hey, babe.

1508
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:34,522
What do you think?

1509
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:35,732
Who was that?

1510
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:36,858
Hmm?

1511
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:37,942
On the phone.

1512
01:26:38,027 --> 01:26:41,446
Oh, it was... it's my,
uh, language teacher.

1513
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:42,530
Yeah?

1514
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:48,703
He wants me to have a good-bye lunch
with him tomorrow at noon.

1515
01:26:48,788 --> 01:26:49,788
Oh, that's perfect.

1516
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:51,915
I'm gonna play golf with Mark
in the morning.

1517
01:26:51,999 --> 01:26:53,458
##

1518
01:26:53,459 --> 01:26:55,460
##

1519
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:01,359
(indistinct)

1520
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:03,695
Well, this is...

1521
01:28:06,115 --> 01:28:09,033
Oh, I've been working
on these ones lately.

1522
01:28:10,703 --> 01:28:12,996
Uh, yeah.

1523
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:15,373
They're very overwhelming, my God.

1524
01:28:15,458 --> 01:28:19,043
Yeah. I mean, it's very hard
to explain the painting, all right?

1525
01:28:19,128 --> 01:28:22,088
No, you don't have to.
It's fascinating. It's fascinating.

1526
01:28:22,173 --> 01:28:25,508
This one, actually,
should be the other way around.

1527
01:28:29,138 --> 01:28:31,181
I like it very much.

1528
01:28:31,265 --> 01:28:34,517
Can... can I... can I be frank
about something?

1529
01:28:34,602 --> 01:28:35,602
Yeah.

1530
01:28:35,686 --> 01:28:40,815
This one, it's... it's... there's
something very frightening about it.

1531
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:44,736
- Uh, that one is Maria Elena's.
- Right, well, that explains it.

1532
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:49,407
It's very chaotic
and erratic, almost, but...

1533
01:28:49,492 --> 01:28:53,203
(pants) Oh, God,
what am I doing here?

1534
01:28:53,287 --> 01:28:55,580
I don't know what I expect to happen.

1535
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:59,459
It's been a long time
since we made love that night in Oviedo...

1536
01:28:59,543 --> 01:29:00,543
Yes, I...

1537
01:29:00,628 --> 01:29:02,462
...and I've thought about it
many, many times.

1538
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:04,047
I'm sure you weren't
thinking about it

1539
01:29:04,131 --> 01:29:06,883
when you were making love
to Cristina or Maria Elena...

1540
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:08,593
I never lied to you.

1541
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:13,223
I mean, I told you from the first moment
I was attracted to both you and Cristina.

1542
01:29:13,307 --> 01:29:14,474
Yeah, look...

1543
01:29:15,476 --> 01:29:19,562
I can't just go to bed with you.
I'm... I'm not good at this.

1544
01:29:19,647 --> 01:29:21,397
But you weren't nervous that night.

1545
01:29:21,482 --> 01:29:24,234
- I wasn't married.
- You were about to be.

1546
01:29:24,318 --> 01:29:26,903
Yeah, you're right.
It's what I want.

1547
01:29:26,987 --> 01:29:30,448
But I... what am I supposed to do,
make love with you and then...

1548
01:29:30,533 --> 01:29:33,326
and then go on with my marriage
like nothing happened,

1549
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:35,161
or just terminate it?

1550
01:29:35,246 --> 01:29:38,081
Judy Nash says you
are heading an unhappy life.

1551
01:29:38,165 --> 01:29:40,625
Well, she's talking about herself.

1552
01:29:41,752 --> 01:29:44,504
Maybe you will understand
more about your own feelings

1553
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:45,922
once we've made love.

1554
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:47,131
Yeah, or less.

1555
01:29:47,216 --> 01:29:49,759
Look, I'm not saying
I'm not tempted,

1556
01:29:49,843 --> 01:29:53,263
but it would require
such an upheaval emotionally.

1557
01:29:53,347 --> 01:29:55,682
And from a practical point of view,

1558
01:29:55,766 --> 01:29:57,725
you're not exactly
the kind of man to plan a...

1559
01:29:57,810 --> 01:29:59,394
(continues sentence, muffled)

1560
01:29:59,478 --> 01:30:00,520
(gun fires)

1561
01:30:00,604 --> 01:30:01,896
JUAN ANTONIO: Maria Elena!

1562
01:30:01,981 --> 01:30:03,856
No, no! Maria Elena!

1563
01:30:03,941 --> 01:30:06,818
- VICKY: What are you doing? Don't!
- (Maria Elena squeals)

1564
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:10,029
(both yelling in Spanish)

1565
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,662
(fires twice)

1566
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:20,039
(Maria Elena shrieking and crying)

1567
01:30:20,124 --> 01:30:22,917
JUAN ANTONIO: Dámela,
dámela, dámela. Ya, ya.

1568
01:30:23,002 --> 01:30:24,335
(yelling)

1569
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:40,184
Maria Elena. Maria Elena. Maria Elena.

1570
01:30:43,272 --> 01:30:44,564
Maria Elena.

1571
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:52,280
(sobbing)

1572
01:30:53,866 --> 01:30:56,200
- (gun fires)
- (shrieks)

1573
01:30:56,285 --> 01:30:58,244
- My God!
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

1574
01:30:58,329 --> 01:30:59,579
Oh, my God, my hand!

1575
01:30:59,663 --> 01:31:02,081
(Maria Elena speaking Spanish)

1576
01:31:02,166 --> 01:31:04,876
(hysterically) You're both crazy!
You're both complete...

1577
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,420
Both of you are completely insane!

1578
01:31:07,504 --> 01:31:09,839
How the hell am I gonna
explain this to my husband?

1579
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:11,716
- JUAN ANTONIO: I'm sorry.
- I can't live like this!

1580
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,385
This is not my life!

1581
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:15,928
Maria Elena. Maria Elena.

1582
01:31:16,013 --> 01:31:19,265
(speaking Spanish)

1583
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:22,101
DOUG: I still don't understand
what your language teacher

1584
01:31:22,186 --> 01:31:23,353
was doing with a gun.

1585
01:31:23,437 --> 01:31:26,189
VICKY: Look, I told you,
he collects these antique firearms,

1586
01:31:26,273 --> 01:31:28,316
- and he was showing me...
- God! We should sue him.

1587
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,568
- It just went off.
- That is so damn irresponsible.

1588
01:31:30,653 --> 01:31:32,236
- No, no, it's not.
- Jesus.

1589
01:31:32,321 --> 01:31:34,864
- Once the bandages come off...
- What if something happened to you?

1590
01:31:34,948 --> 01:31:36,366
...It'll be a scratch. What?

1591
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:37,825
What are you saying?

1592
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:40,536
I love you so much.

1593
01:31:40,621 --> 01:31:42,705
Doug never found out
the real story.

1594
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:45,667
##

1595
01:31:45,751 --> 01:31:48,127
Judy knew the secret,
and of course was relieved

1596
01:31:48,212 --> 01:31:50,630
Vicky had not been
hurt worse, or killed.

1597
01:31:51,632 --> 01:31:53,758
With Vicky leaving
to go back to New York,

1598
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:56,219
Judy's plans to rescue Vicky
from her own fate

1599
01:31:56,303 --> 01:31:58,221
were put on terminal hold.

1600
01:32:02,142 --> 01:32:05,395
When Cristina returned from Antibes
Vicky told her the whole tale,

1601
01:32:05,479 --> 01:32:08,731
and Cristina thought it was sad
how much Vicky had wanted Juan Antonio

1602
01:32:08,816 --> 01:32:11,317
and was unable to say
or do anything about it.

1603
01:32:11,402 --> 01:32:13,069
But I would've stepped aside.

1604
01:32:13,153 --> 01:32:16,239
No, no. Look, I knew you
had feelings for Juan Antonio

1605
01:32:16,323 --> 01:32:17,907
from the moment you saw him.

1606
01:32:17,991 --> 01:32:21,411
But if I knew what had happened,
I never would've gone ahead with it.

1607
01:32:21,495 --> 01:32:25,331
It was a... passing thing.

1608
01:32:26,625 --> 01:32:28,209
Now it's over.

1609
01:32:29,211 --> 01:32:31,921
("Barcelona" reprises)

1610
01:32:55,946 --> 01:32:59,115
Vicky went home to have
her grand wedding to Doug,

1611
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:01,701
to the house they both
finally settled on,

1612
01:33:01,785 --> 01:33:04,245
and to lead the life
she had envisioned for herself

1613
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:06,372
before the summer in Barcelona.

1614
01:33:07,374 --> 01:33:10,084
Cristina continued searching,

1615
01:33:10,169 --> 01:33:13,254
certain only of what she didn't want.

1616
01:33:23,724 --> 01:33:27,643
