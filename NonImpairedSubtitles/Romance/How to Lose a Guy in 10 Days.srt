1
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,781
What you get is what you see

2
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:26,121
And you can bet
it's worth it, baby

3
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:33,122
'Cause what you get is me

4
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:38,261
Don't be afraid
to let it embrace you

5
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:42,502
l'm gonna show you
every little thing about love

6
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,533
-Yeah, yeah
-Do you really want it?

7
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:45,805
lf you want it,
you can get it

8
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:47,472
lf you get it, don't regret it

9
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,747
So what you gonna do?

10
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:53,547
Love is like a butterfly,
tapestry across the sky

11
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:55,520
Doesn't need a reason why l feel
it taking you and l

12
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,182
Higher and higher

13
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,283
So what you gonna do?

14
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,122
lf you only knew
what l just dealt with.

15
00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:06,825
l mean, this guy was right in
front of me, going little...

16
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,959
That guy deserves a ticket.
l'm sure he's...

17
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,266
A-A-A woman never
reveals her age.

18
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:12,566
l've been in this
relationship for...

19
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,095
He was going ten miles an hour
on the highway.

20
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,164
l'm trying to...

21
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,405
lf you want it, you can get it

22
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:22,244
Higher and higher

23
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,843
''And only then
will the people of Tajikistan

24
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,376
know true and lasting peace.''

25
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:32,016
Andie, it's brilliant.

26
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,717
lt's really moving.

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,321
But it's never going to appear
in Composure Magazine.

28
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:41,297
God, l busted my butt
in grad school

29
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:44,201
to be Andie Anderson,
''How to'' girl,

30
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,137
and write articles like,

31
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,696
''How to Use the Best
Pick-Up Lines''

32
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,937
and ''Do Blondes, Do They, Like,

33
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,740
Really Have
More Fun?''

34
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,610
l want to write about
things that matter,

35
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:57,445
like politics and
the environment,

36
00:01:57,483 --> 00:01:59,974
and foreign affairs--
things l'm interested in.

37
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,384
Keep busting your butt.

38
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,945
You're going to get there.

39
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,856
Hey, l've got something
to cheer you up.

40
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,985
You know that editor
from Sports lllustrated

41
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,221
that you have been
shamelessly flirting with

42
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,730
on the phone for... whoo,

43
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,994
a month now?

44
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,227
He made a little delivery
this morning.

45
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,499
Ah, ha, ha, let me see.

46
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,562
Oh, no.

47
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:20,970
Hey!

48
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,202
Tomorrow night.

49
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:26,609
What happens tomorrow night?

50
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,615
Only the most exhilarating
and artistic display

51
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,480
of athletic competition
known to mankind.

52
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:33,144
The lce Capades are in town?

53
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,984
No, the NBA Finals
are in town,

54
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,422
and l got tickets!

55
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:40,514
Come with me?

56
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,357
All right, l'll go.

57
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,158
But l am not putting out.

58
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,757
Two stale jumbo dogs
and a couple of beers,

59
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,359
you'll be whistling
a different tune.

60
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,131
You know what l like.

61
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,694
Good morning, ladies.

62
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,537
Don't forget,
staff meeting in 30 minutes.

63
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:00,845
Michelle-- haven't seen
her all morning.

64
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,814
-Have you?
-Ten to one she's wallowing.

65
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,578
lt's my turn. l'll get her,
you get the coffee,

66
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:05,675
meet me in the corner in 20.

67
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:06,707
Wait, wait, wait.

68
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,277
Here, take some samples.

69
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,516
Samples. Samples.

70
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:12,888
Great idea.

71
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:16,019
Oh, boy.
Drama, drama, drama.

72
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,232
l walked 47 miles of barb wire

73
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,463
l got a cobra snake
for a necktie

74
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,495
A brand-new house
on the road side

75
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,473
And it's made out
of rattlesnake hide

76
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,611
Come on, take a little walk
with me, baby

77
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,775
And tell me who do you love

78
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,250
Hey!

79
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:44,245
Who do you love?

80
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,383
Now around the town
l use a rattlesnake whip

81
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,690
Take it easy, baby,
don't you give me no lip

82
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:53,188
Who do you love?

83
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:55,496
Who do you love?

84
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,145
Hello, Ben.

85
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,844
Hey, hey, good morning, Spears.

86
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:16,946
What are you reading, girl?

87
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:18,752
You catching up on
your current events?

88
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,885
''Turn-On Tricks:
How to Make Him Hot.''

89
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,987
You know, if you want
to try those out sometime,

90
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:25,154
we should get together.

91
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,792
Green and l have
an appointment at Composure,

92
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:31,837
the fastest growing women's
magazine in the country.

93
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,800
And seeing as how

94
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:34,499
our clients run a lot
of our campaigns

95
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:37,269
in their nationally-syndicated
little girlie magazine,

96
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:39,277
it wouldn't hurt you
to do a little reading.

97
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:41,006
Hey, Benny.

98
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,103
Good morning, Green.

99
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:43,273
You finally decided to show up?

100
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:44,646
Yes, l did.

101
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:45,707
You ready?

102
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,774
Ready.

103
00:04:46,818 --> 00:04:48,445
Later, Ben.

104
00:04:48,486 --> 00:04:51,080
Have a nice day, ladies.

105
00:04:53,758 --> 00:04:54,816
Hi.

106
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:57,756
Oh!

107
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,330
Good morning, sunshine.

108
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:02,799
Okay, get dressed.

109
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:03,823
Get dressed.

110
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:05,427
Staff meeting, 15 minutes.
Let's go.

111
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,599
l'm going back to bed.

112
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:12,473
l have no reason to live.

113
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,807
Sun's out. Oh...

114
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:15,745
Okay, just...

115
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,407
Okay, now...

116
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,613
Cashmere?

117
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:22,620
Put it on.

118
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:24,622
lt'll make your eyes
look fiercely green.

119
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:25,953
Oh!

120
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:27,959
Get up. l'm not going
to let you lose your job

121
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:29,153
on top of everything else.

122
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:30,525
-Oh.
-Come here.

123
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:32,826
Oh, Andie.

124
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:34,195
Okay.

125
00:05:34,232 --> 00:05:35,392
Okay.

126
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:36,832
You only dated the guy a week.

127
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:40,326
lt was the best week of my life.

128
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:43,101
Sweetheart.

129
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,505
Good morning, ladies.

130
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:45,668
-What's up, Tito?
-Hey.

131
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,677
Warren Advertising.

132
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:48,508
Hi, yes, we're waiting for you.

133
00:05:48,546 --> 00:05:49,513
Good morning.

134
00:05:49,547 --> 00:05:51,242
What's up, kitty cat?

135
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:52,875
What's up, daddy?

136
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:53,942
Big night?

137
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:55,145
-Not bad.
-Orgy?

138
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:56,346
Where were you, man?

139
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:58,288
Not at an orgy.

140
00:05:58,323 --> 00:05:59,381
Did you hear?

141
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:00,618
What, that my Knickerbockers

142
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:02,149
are now in
the championship series

143
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:04,184
and Tone ''The Bone'' here
owes me $20?

144
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:05,321
Pay him.

145
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:06,330
Oh, man.

146
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:07,661
Well, you were right.

147
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,860
DeLauer Diamonds is looking
for a new ad agency.

148
00:06:09,901 --> 00:06:11,732
Warren wants to move
on it aggressively.

149
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,169
Yes!

150
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:16,435
Oh, oh, this is a good day,
this is a good day.

151
00:06:16,474 --> 00:06:18,135
Guys, did you know
that diamonds are about

152
00:06:18,176 --> 00:06:19,700
as common as taxis
on Fifth Avenue?

153
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:22,577
The value is entirely
sentimental,

154
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:23,740
maintained by a supply,

155
00:06:23,782 --> 00:06:26,182
demand and advertising.

156
00:06:26,217 --> 00:06:27,684
Stripes.

157
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:30,415
Now, DeLauer dominates
the world diamond market.

158
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:31,979
Meaning if l represent them,

159
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:34,355
l basically represent
the entire industry.

160
00:06:34,392 --> 00:06:35,984
Tell him.

161
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:36,856
What?

162
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:38,157
Warren gave it to the Judys.

163
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:39,959
Spears and Green--
they're already on it.

164
00:06:39,998 --> 00:06:41,192
No way!

165
00:06:41,232 --> 00:06:42,859
Yeah, well, you know,
he's kind of partial

166
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:44,562
to hot, leggy chicks
for some reason.

167
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:46,399
Yeah, and we're the, you know,

168
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:47,462
the sneakers and beer division.

169
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:48,870
Precious gems aren't exactly
our forte.

170
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:52,172
Lips and Hips are over at
a chick's magazine right now.

171
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,007
l got to get to Warren
before they sink...

172
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:55,512
You can't, you can't.
He's on a plane.

173
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:56,878
Easy, pal.
The Chicago meeting.

174
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:58,314
And it's too late anyway,
because Warren's

175
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,011
meeting them for drinks
at Mullins' tonight

176
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:01,109
to discuss their ideas.

177
00:07:01,152 --> 00:07:02,244
You know what?
This isn't happening.

178
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:03,515
You know why?
This was my tip.

179
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:05,147
lt's going to be my pitch,
my account, my campaign.

180
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,748
-This is my baby.
-That's what l'm talking about.

181
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:07,815
They will not ace me
out of this.

182
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:09,952
-That's right.
-l heard that.

183
00:07:10,061 --> 00:07:11,050
Okay.
Mullins', tonight.

184
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:12,893
''l heard that''?

185
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,900
Oh.

186
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:17,959
-Hi.
-Hi.

187
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:20,094
l-l don't really want
to talk about it, okay?

188
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:21,127
-Okay.
-Okay.

189
00:07:21,172 --> 00:07:22,799
Okay.

190
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:25,901
Why does this always happen
to me?

191
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:27,969
Things were going great
for, like, a week and a half,

192
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,138
and then, all of a sudden,
it's over,

193
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:31,478
and l am mystified.

194
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:33,450
Seriously, l am mystified,

195
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:36,511
because it always starts out
so well.

196
00:07:36,554 --> 00:07:37,680
Poor baby.

197
00:07:37,722 --> 00:07:39,189
Let's just roll with this one.

198
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:41,988
Oh, Mike and l had
such a connection.

199
00:07:42,027 --> 00:07:43,790
The first time that we had sex,

200
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,157
...it was so beautiful...

201
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:49,223
l cried.

202
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:53,504
You cried?

203
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:55,199
Yeah.

204
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,832
You mean, like,
one glistening tear

205
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,172
on your cheek, right?

206
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:00,370
No. l was really emotional.

207
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:03,108
l even told him
that l loved him.

208
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:04,740
After how many days?

209
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:05,841
Five.

210
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:07,317
Two.

211
00:08:07,352 --> 00:08:09,946
lt was how l felt.
l wanted to express myself.

212
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:12,582
Okay, well, what did he say?

213
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:14,888
Oh, Mike didn't have
to say anything.

214
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:16,860
l know that he felt the same.

215
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,058
But then he started
getting really busy,

216
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:21,531
and l didn't know where he was.

217
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:23,796
So l kept calling him
and calling him.

218
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:24,802
He was never home...

219
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:26,133
You kept calling him?

220
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:28,139
l didn't leave a message.

221
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:30,198
He didn't know it was me.
My number's blocked.

222
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:33,768
Oh, l-l'm sure he thought
it was one of his friends.

223
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:34,972
You know, men frequently call

224
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:36,480
their friends'
answering machines

225
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:37,742
and hang up 20 times.

226
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:38,976
Anyway...

227
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,281
l know why he dumped me:

228
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,981
l'm too fat.

229
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:45,784
-You're not fat!
-You're not fat!

230
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:49,725
Oh, Michelle, if the most
beautiful woman in the world

231
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:50,728
acted the way you did,

232
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:52,252
any normal guy
would still go running

233
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:53,321
in the other direction.

234
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:56,561
Oh, no. No guy would go
running from you, Andie.

235
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:59,832
You could barf all over him,
and he would say, ''Do it again.''

236
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:02,635
That is both
incredibly disgusting

237
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:04,505
and categorically untrue.

238
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:07,246
lf l did the things you did,
l'd get dumped, too.

239
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:09,940
Okay, family,

240
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:12,539
shoes off.

241
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,646
And breathe.

242
00:09:19,157 --> 00:09:20,647
Out.

243
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:24,828
Okay, Lori,
let's start with you.

244
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:26,854
Well, the ''Botox for Beginners''
piece is done.

245
00:09:26,898 --> 00:09:28,957
Now, it's a little scary,
but mostly upbeat.

246
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,093
Now l'm on

247
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:31,261
''What Your Gyno Won't Tell You,''

248
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:32,770
which is also pretty scary,

249
00:09:32,804 --> 00:09:33,828
but, you know, upbeat.

250
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:35,737
l finished my research
on deadly pedicures,

251
00:09:35,774 --> 00:09:37,366
about the woman who contracted

252
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:39,104
that fungus
from the unsterilized tools.

253
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:40,975
Yeah.

254
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:42,138
lt's a terrible story.

255
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,580
Although, surprisingly...

256
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:45,878
upbeat!

257
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,407
Marvelous.

258
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:50,580
What's next for
'''How to' with Andie''?

259
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:52,817
Well, l've been
working on something

260
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:53,984
that's kind of different.

261
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:55,856
lt's...

262
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:56,918
lt's a political piece,
and it's...

263
00:09:56,962 --> 00:09:57,986
No.

264
00:09:58,096 --> 00:10:00,291
Andie, you work at
Composure Magazine.

265
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:01,390
We are fashion,

266
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:03,560
trends, diets,
cosmetic surgeries,

267
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,627
salacious gossip--
that's Composure.

268
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,104
-Okay, but...
-Look,

269
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,937
Andie, okay--
the column is new for you.

270
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:12,273
When you turn it
into a must-read,

271
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,677
then you can write
about whatever you want.

272
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:18,274
Until then, you can write
about whatever l want.

273
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,545
Understood?

274
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:21,211
Yeah.

275
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,413
Michelle, what have you got?

276
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,815
l'm sorry, Lana,

277
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:27,984
l wasn't feeling very well...

278
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:29,015
She got dumped.

279
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:31,494
Oh, no,

280
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,724
Michelle...

281
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:35,733
What a hellish ordeal for you.

282
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:37,735
But l must say,
you are looking fabulous.

283
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:39,031
Are we loving

284
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:40,331
the way she looks, all?

285
00:10:40,372 --> 00:10:42,272
-We love the way she looks.
-Oh, you are so right.

286
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:43,604
She looks great.

287
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:45,132
Well, l haven't eaten
since the split.

288
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,269
Good for you!

289
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:47,437
Write about it.

290
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:50,448
l can't use my personal life
for a story.

291
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:53,280
l understand completely.

292
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:56,446
Who will use Michelle's
personal life for a story?

293
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:57,420
Oh, l will.

294
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,787
-Go.
-No, no, no,

295
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:59,916
Lana,

296
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:00,947
with all due respect,

297
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:02,084
Lori has no business
mucking around

298
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:03,094
in my personal life,
and l can't...

299
00:11:03,128 --> 00:11:03,992
l can't let her.

300
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,656
-l am...
-l'll do it.

301
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:07,164
What?

302
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,190
l'll... l will...
l'll sort of do it.

303
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:10,792
lt's... You will be

304
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,825
my inspiration.

305
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,859
For?

306
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:15,134
Look at Michelle.

307
00:11:15,173 --> 00:11:19,439
-She is a great girl, right?
-Yes.

308
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,412
An amazing woman.

309
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:25,007
But she has a problem
hanging onto relationships,

310
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,278
and doesn't really know

311
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,182
what she's doing wrong,

312
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,584
which is like a lot
of our readers.

313
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,780
Uh-huh.

314
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:35,623
So, l was thinking that
l could start by dating a guy,

315
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,684
and then drive him away,

316
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:38,889
but only using
the classic mistakes

317
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,398
most women, like Michelle,

318
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:43,401
make...

319
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:45,369
all the time.

320
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,031
l'll keep a diary of it,

321
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:54,307
and it will be sort of a...
dating ''How to'' in reverse.

322
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,348
What not to do.

323
00:11:57,382 --> 00:11:59,316
Yeah.

324
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,377
''How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days.''

325
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,389
Yes. Go.

326
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,084
Bart, what's new
in the shoe world?

327
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:07,989
Wait, wait, Lana, l'm sorry.

328
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:09,321
Why ten days?

329
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,922
Five days is too short,
and we go to press in 11. Yes?

330
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:14,158
Okay, what we found out

331
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:15,996
is men are attracted
to purple shoes.

332
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:17,592
Now, l love...

333
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:22,002
Maybe toss in something
spiritual as well.

334
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:25,531
Who's that chic Buddhist
Richard Gere cavorts with?

335
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:26,544
The Dalai Lama.

336
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:27,670
He's fabulous. Ah!

337
00:12:27,712 --> 00:12:28,940
Here's my 10:00. Welcome.

338
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,969
Hi.

339
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,381
Ladies, Judy Spears
and Judy Green

340
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:34,146
from Warren Advertising.

341
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,620
We're going to cook up
some fabulous tie-ins

342
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:37,622
for the fall.

343
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,591
Jeannie Ashcroft,
Fashion and Trends.

344
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,183
Michelle Rubin,
Fitness and Health.

345
00:12:42,227 --> 00:12:43,421
Excuse me. Hi.

346
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,794
And Andie Anderson,
our resident ''How to'' girl.

347
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,196
Oh, l've seen
your column, Andie.

348
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:48,460
What are you working on now?

349
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,626
Oh, actually...

350
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,569
''How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days.''

351
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:54,595
She's actually going
to start dating a guy,

352
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,664
and then drive him away
in a week and a half.

353
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,667
Sounds needlessly vicious.

354
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:00,973
lt's going to be fabulous.

355
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,774
Now all she has to do
is run along

356
00:13:02,814 --> 00:13:04,611
and find the lucky guy.
Go, go, go.

357
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:05,809
-Nice to meet you.
-Bye.

358
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:06,977
Good-bye.

359
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:08,349
Ladies, come.

360
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:09,353
Find the guy.

361
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:10,684
-Okay.
-Find the guy.

362
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:13,156
Oh, you are never going
to pull this off.

363
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:15,216
Watch me.
Tonight, l'll hook a guy.

364
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,852
Tomorrow, pull the switch.

365
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:18,988
Before the ten days are up,

366
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:20,997
l'm going to have this guy
running for his life.

367
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:23,398
You're not going to burn
his apartment down

368
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,198
or bite him or anything,
are you?

369
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,795
No! l'm going to limit myself

370
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:29,636
to doing everything girls
do wrong in relationships.

371
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:31,869
Basically, everything
we know guys hate.

372
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,242
l'll be clingy, needy...

373
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,507
-Yeah.
-Be touchy-feely.

374
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:37,139
Ooh, call him in the middle
of the night,

375
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:39,013
and tell him everything
you had to eat that day.

376
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:40,482
What's wrong with that?

377
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,881
l'm kidding.

378
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:56,025
Hello, Ben.

379
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:58,034
What are you doing here?

380
00:13:58,069 --> 00:14:00,094
Phil, l'm here for
the meeting. Ladies.

381
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:01,400
But you weren't invited.

382
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:03,464
Yeah, but l should have been.

383
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:04,941
l mean, it was my tip

384
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:06,500
that DeLauer's shopping
for a new firm.

385
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,103
Yes, it was, but l have
to think in terms

386
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:09,909
of who's best-suited
within the company team.

387
00:14:09,948 --> 00:14:13,076
Yes, sir, and that's me.
l want to handle this pitch.

388
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,451
Ben, you sell Joe Blow better
than anyone else in my shop,

389
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,149
but these girls sell luxury

390
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:20,657
better than anyone else
in the business.

391
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:22,990
We have to put our best foot
forward on this pitch.

392
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:24,755
DeLauer would be
our biggest account.

393
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:25,990
Yes, sir, they would.

394
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:28,692
Annual advertising billings
of 50- to $60 million.

395
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,257
And l am the man that's going

396
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,997
to bring this home
for you, Phil.

397
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,435
Why this place?

398
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,665
lt's perfect.

399
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:35,730
Hi, lngrid.

400
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:36,968
Hi.

401
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:39,670
Mullins' is the apres-work
watering hole

402
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:41,303
for the upwardly mobile.

403
00:14:41,346 --> 00:14:42,370
Now, to date,

404
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,575
the diamond industry
has always targeted men,

405
00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:46,584
sending the message
that the woman needs the man

406
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:48,017
to buy her the rock.

407
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:50,646
All right, they say,
''A diamond is forever.''

408
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,816
We say,
''A diamond is for everyone.''

409
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:53,983
l like that.
Yes.

410
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:54,992
We don't.

411
00:14:55,026 --> 00:14:56,857
''A diamond is for everyone''

412
00:14:56,895 --> 00:15:00,058
sends the message
that diamonds are everywhere,

413
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:03,727
which means they're not rare,
and if they're not rare,

414
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:05,326
they lose their status.

415
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,769
Status is the reason

416
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,534
to buy them in the first place,

417
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:11,064
which Benjamin would know
if he understood women,

418
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:12,041
which you don't.

419
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:18,111
You can't feel bad about that,
Ben. No man does.

420
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:19,116
Here you go.

421
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,117
Thank you.

422
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:21,118
Thanks.

423
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:22,449
Oh! Sorry.

424
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,123
Here. Here.

425
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:27,317
Thanks.

426
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,827
Dum, dum, dum, dum,
dum, dum, dum...

427
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:31,658
Hey, don't pressure her.
She's perusing.

428
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:33,664
Yes, exactly. Hmm.

429
00:15:33,698 --> 00:15:35,188
Hmm.

430
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:37,201
Selling a diamond to a woman

431
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:39,499
is like making her fall in love.

432
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:43,337
She has to feel giddy,
desirous, adventurous,

433
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,865
and desperate.

434
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:46,638
Take a look around
this room, Phillip.

435
00:15:46,678 --> 00:15:49,909
Most of the women in this bar
are looking for just that.

436
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:52,109
Exactly. The skills required
to market diamonds

437
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,415
are the same as those needed to
make a woman fall in love, yes.

438
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:56,977
l'm not talking about lust.

439
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,114
A woman in lust

440
00:15:58,156 --> 00:15:59,521
wants chocolate.

441
00:15:59,557 --> 00:16:01,957
A woman in love...
wants diamonds.

442
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,652
Yeah, l'm not talking

443
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:05,788
about lust, either, ladies.

444
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,492
l'm talking about deep,
meaningful,

445
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:10,398
head-over-heels,
his and her towels,

446
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:13,893
let's grow old together,
L-O-V-E.

447
00:16:13,938 --> 00:16:17,897
Look, l love women. l do.

448
00:16:17,942 --> 00:16:22,311
Whether they're four, 40,
or my 88-year-old grandmother,

449
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:24,372
l respect women, all right?

450
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,977
And l also listen... to women,

451
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:32,182
and that's why l can sell myself
to any woman, anywhere, anytime.

452
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:35,989
Make a woman fall in love
with diamonds, Benjamin...

453
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:37,529
or with you?

454
00:16:38,496 --> 00:16:39,326
Eh, either one.

455
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:40,922
Well, that's cocky, Ben.

456
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:43,331
No, not cocky-- confident.

457
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:46,462
l'd like to see you prove that.

458
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:47,732
You would?

459
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:49,262
The agency's cohosting

460
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:52,276
a party for the DeLauers
at the Astor Museum.

461
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,175
The party's a week from Sunday.

462
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:55,474
Do you think you could make

463
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:57,242
a woman fall in love with you
by then?

464
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,443
Ten days?

465
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:01,111
Any woman, anywhere, anytime?

466
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:05,452
Any single, available,
straight woman-- yes.

467
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,479
Yes.

468
00:17:06,524 --> 00:17:07,957
l'm not trying
to trick you, Ben.

469
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:10,961
ln fact, we'll choose
a woman right here,

470
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,758
right now, in this bar,

471
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:14,230
and then you decide.

472
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:15,197
Ooh.

473
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:18,297
So, who's the lucky girl?

474
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:19,268
Okay...

475
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:21,937
Let's see here. Ooh,

476
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:24,373
there's that blonde babe
in the leopard print.

477
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:25,433
Whoa, ho, ho!

478
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:26,568
She looks like fun.

479
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:27,805
Be nice, ladies.

480
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:29,142
Or... wow,

481
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,647
Miss Babylon Five.

482
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,650
Now, she's on the prowl.

483
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,151
No.

484
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:35,447
Her.

485
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:36,851
Her who?

486
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:40,449
Her, in the gray dress.
Blonde hair. Pretty smile.

487
00:17:45,096 --> 00:17:46,586
Her?

488
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,837
Done.

489
00:17:53,871 --> 00:17:55,498
What?

490
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,167
Done.

491
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,800
Done.

492
00:17:58,843 --> 00:18:02,438
See the guy next
to the horrible guy

493
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,472
in the green shirt that l would
never even consider? Okay?

494
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:06,574
-Hmm!
-Very cute.

495
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,642
Right?

496
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:08,947
-Good.
-All right?

497
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,579
Here l go!

498
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:14,351
Okay, you're on.

499
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:15,620
But here are the stakes.

500
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,287
After l win this bet,

501
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:18,727
this pitch is mine.

502
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:19,730
Agreed.

503
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:21,527
-Phil?
-Agreed.

504
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:23,500
You come to that party
with a girl

505
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:25,695
that's really in love
with you, Ben...

506
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,967
you can make the pitch
to the DeLauers.

507
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,667
But, Phillip, you can't...

508
00:18:29,707 --> 00:18:32,699
l've made up my mind.

509
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:33,768
To the DeLauers.

510
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:35,142
To the DeLauers.

511
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:36,237
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

512
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,577
Cheers.

513
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:38,980
-Mm-mm.
-Mm-mm.

514
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,451
l was just wondering
if you find...

515
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:46,446
...exciting?

516
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:48,652
Yes. My wife and l love
New York,

517
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:50,285
especially this time of year.

518
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:52,125
She'd been here before,
and l'd...

519
00:18:52,163 --> 00:18:53,152
-Hi.
-Hi.

520
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:54,323
This is Andie.

521
00:18:54,365 --> 00:18:56,265
Hi. Um...

522
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,267
Oh!

523
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:58,359
You guys enjoy New York.

524
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,461
Okay.

525
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:00,402
Thanks. We will.

526
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:01,735
Yeah. Nice meet...
nice meeting you.

527
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:02,865
Eww!

528
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,441
Good luck!

529
00:19:07,478 --> 00:19:08,775
Thank you, Phil.

530
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:11,611
Now, if you'll excuse me,
ladies...

531
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:13,048
l have a bet to win.

532
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:14,813
Ta-ta.

533
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:23,055
Now do you want to tell
me what's going on?

534
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:24,755
You don't recognize her?

535
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:32,935
Hi.

536
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,959
Hi.

537
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,403
Hi.

538
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:40,102
Andie Anderson.

539
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:41,577
l'm Benjamin Barry.

540
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:42,579
Cute.

541
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:43,580
Thank you.

542
00:19:43,614 --> 00:19:45,275
l meant your name.

543
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:47,978
Thank you two times.

544
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:49,451
Unattached?

545
00:19:49,487 --> 00:19:50,715
Currently.

546
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:51,722
Likewise.

547
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:53,883
Surprising.

548
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:55,290
Psycho?

549
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:56,884
Rarely.

550
00:19:56,928 --> 00:19:58,190
Hmm.

551
00:19:58,229 --> 00:19:59,423
lnterested?

552
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,261
Perhaps.

553
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:02,698
Hungry?

554
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,362
Starving.

555
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:06,427
-Leaving.
-Now?

556
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,438
Mm-hmm.

557
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:08,996
Okay.

558
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,598
Okay.

559
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:12,108
One second.

560
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:14,338
l'll meet you at the door.

561
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:15,845
Hey, hey, guys.

562
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,347
What?

563
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:18,507
l think l got one.

564
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:20,016
He was married.

565
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,780
No, not him. lt's the guy by
the door, but don't-don't look.

566
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,515
Oh, guys!

567
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:29,552
Oh! He is really cute!

568
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:31,653
l'm going to check this one out
and see if he's the keeper.

569
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:32,663
Okay.

570
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:33,664
And if he is?

571
00:20:33,698 --> 00:20:35,563
Tomorrow night, we'll...

572
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,033
Flip the switch.

573
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:39,592
Doing this for you.

574
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:42,162
Well, good luck.
Be safe.

575
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:43,332
Call me.

576
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:44,534
Mm...

577
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:47,738
Drama, drama, drama.

578
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:53,179
...you

579
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:55,447
Wanna get to know you...

580
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:01,549
No, no, no. This one.

581
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:16,431
And you get to wear
the goofy-looking helmet.

582
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,203
This won't look goofy on me.

583
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:23,213
lt looks goofy
on just about everybody.

584
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:25,511
Look at you.

585
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,177
That's pretty damn cute.

586
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:32,418
There you go.

587
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:41,990
You ready to go
for a ride, Andie?

588
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:45,002
Are you ready to go
for a ride, Ben?

589
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:56,805
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Get it? Get it?

590
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,042
Yeah.

591
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:59,810
Mmm. So, what do you think?

592
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,479
About the food, or... you?

593
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,613
Both.

594
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:06,247
This is delicious...

595
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,279
Mm-hmm.

596
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,555
...and l'm still deciding.

597
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,459
Anything l can do to help?

598
00:22:11,495 --> 00:22:13,554
Yeah, you could answer some
questions for me, actually.

599
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,725
''Some'' sounds
a little too indefinite.

600
00:22:15,766 --> 00:22:16,892
l'll give you three.

601
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:18,595
What do you do for a living?

602
00:22:18,636 --> 00:22:19,830
l'm in advertising.

603
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:21,600
l work mostly
with alcoholic beverage

604
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:23,163
and athletic equipment
companies,

605
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:26,005
and l'm trying to break into
the jewelry market right now.

606
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:27,010
Hmm...

607
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:30,103
Saving the world,
one keg party at a time?

608
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:32,547
Yeah, something like that.

609
00:22:36,854 --> 00:22:38,446
What about you?

610
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:40,457
What about me?

611
00:22:40,491 --> 00:22:41,788
Have l seen your work?

612
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:43,623
l work at Composure.

613
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:47,188
Fastest-growing women's
fashion magazine in the country.

614
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:48,425
l'm impressed.

615
00:22:48,466 --> 00:22:50,229
Saving the world,
one shop-a-holic at a time, eh?

616
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:53,964
Hey, all right.

617
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,472
Look here, Sparky,

618
00:22:55,506 --> 00:22:57,167
l have a Master's
in journalism

619
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,368
from Columbia.

620
00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:01,970
My boss loves me, and if l do it
her way for a while,

621
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:04,274
l can write about
anything l want.

622
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:06,078
Like shoes?

623
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:07,607
No.

624
00:23:08,686 --> 00:23:09,653
No.

625
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:12,315
Like alcoholic beverages

626
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:14,551
and athletic gear.

627
00:23:16,093 --> 00:23:18,391
Touche. Very nice.

628
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:20,989
So, you think you got me
all figured out, eh?

629
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:21,999
Almost.

630
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:25,469
Still got one last question.

631
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:27,971
Shoot.

632
00:23:28,005 --> 00:23:30,166
True or false:

633
00:23:31,976 --> 00:23:36,913
all's fair in love and war.

634
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,846
True.

635
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:44,945
Great answer.

636
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:47,719
Good question.

637
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:49,521
Welcome.

638
00:23:52,863 --> 00:23:55,388
Oh, nice place.

639
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,400
Thank you.

640
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,594
Very... tidy.

641
00:23:58,736 --> 00:23:59,703
Can l get you

642
00:23:59,737 --> 00:24:01,068
a cold beer?

643
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:02,072
Sure.

644
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:03,698
Can l use your restroom?

645
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:04,765
Yeah, you can.

646
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:07,243
lt's up the stairs,
through the bedroom.

647
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,382
You are, aren't you?

648
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,214
The first night.
l can't believe you!

649
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,277
Michelle, l'm not going
to sleep with him.

650
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:17,549
Oh, you are such a hussy.

651
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:19,146
You can't hide
those lying eyes.

652
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,387
No, no, because l can practice
some self-control,

653
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,156
unlike some people l know.

654
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:25,526
Oh, really?
That hurts, kind of.

655
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:31,096
Get up up on the dance floor

656
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:32,898
Give that man
what he askin' for

657
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:33,995
'Cuz l feel like...

658
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:35,972
l'm going to dangle the bait...

659
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,372
Wait, what's the bait?

660
00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:38,875
l'm the bait, Michelle.

661
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,138
-Oh...
-Yeah.

662
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,169
Okay, l'm with you. Then what?

663
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:43,840
lt's gettin' hot in here

664
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:44,848
So hot

665
00:24:44,882 --> 00:24:46,873
So take off all your clothes

666
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,250
-Mmm... Diamond...
-l am getting so hot

667
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,721
-is no one-night stand.
-l want to take my clothes off

668
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,223
lt's gettin' hot in here

669
00:24:53,257 --> 00:24:54,246
So hot

670
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,418
So take off all...

671
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:03,123
A diamond
is a long-term commitment.

672
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:04,532
Take notes.
You better be prepared...

673
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:05,934
l can't talk right now.
l have to go.

674
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:06,959
Call me later, you slut.

675
00:25:07,004 --> 00:25:07,936
Okay. Bye.

676
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:12,840
Whatever you want to do

677
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:18,941
ls all right with me...

678
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:20,416
'Cause you make me feel

679
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:21,611
-There you go.
-Thank you.

680
00:25:21,652 --> 00:25:23,085
You're welcome.

681
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,419
...so brand-new

682
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,159
l want to spend

683
00:25:32,196 --> 00:25:33,163
Ooh.

684
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:37,395
My life with you

685
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:41,929
Let me say that since, baby

686
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,601
Since we've been together

687
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,774
Ooh, loving you forever

688
00:25:51,315 --> 00:25:57,015
ls what l need

689
00:25:57,121 --> 00:26:01,182
Let me be the one you come...

690
00:26:01,225 --> 00:26:02,692
Okay.

691
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:06,128
...running to

692
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:14,628
l'll never be untrue

693
00:26:14,672 --> 00:26:20,167
Oh, baby, let's

694
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:24,511
Let's stay together,
together

695
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:28,144
Loving you whether, whether

696
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:29,915
Times are good

697
00:26:29,954 --> 00:26:32,718
Hey, hey, let's not go too fast,
okay?

698
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,816
Happy or sad

699
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,349
Yeah.

700
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:39,920
Yeah.

701
00:26:39,964 --> 00:26:44,367
Ooh... ooh... yeah...

702
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:51,000
Whether times are good or bad

703
00:26:51,075 --> 00:26:52,940
Happy or sad

704
00:26:52,977 --> 00:26:54,444
We're moving too fast.

705
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:57,004
l... you're right.

706
00:26:57,114 --> 00:26:59,014
lt's-it's too fast.

707
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,950
...and break up

708
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:03,476
-Okay.
-Oh, turn around and make up

709
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:10,222
l just can't see

710
00:27:12,997 --> 00:27:17,866
You'd never do that to me

711
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:19,597
-Too fast.
-Too fast.

712
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,070
Yeah.

713
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:23,869
l want you to respect me.

714
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,705
Loving you is all l see

715
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:26,710
l do.

716
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:28,439
Okay.

717
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:30,913
And l want your respect.

718
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:33,746
l respect you for respecting me.

719
00:27:33,784 --> 00:27:36,252
l respect that.

720
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:39,188
Good.

721
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:51,867
Good night, Andie Anderson.

722
00:27:56,474 --> 00:28:00,001
Oh, you are already
falling in love with me.

723
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:02,740
l'm going to make you wish
you were dead.

724
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:05,976
Poor guy.

725
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:17,658
Of all the women
Spears and Green

726
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,959
could have thrown at me,
this one is amazing.

727
00:28:19,997 --> 00:28:22,761
Hanging with her for ten days
is going to be no problem.

728
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,665
Right, so, it's only
nine days longer

729
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:27,227
than you've ever spent
with any other chick, huh?

730
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:29,205
That's why l didn't go
for the gold immediately.

731
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,207
Oh.

732
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:31,208
l'm taking my time.

733
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:32,937
lt's a marathon, not a sprint.

734
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:34,308
Ten days is a marathon?

735
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:37,075
Okay, so it's more like
the 3,000-meter hurdle.

736
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:39,139
The point is, she's already
on the ropes, guys.

737
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:41,014
Wow, that-that's a lot
of sports analogies.

738
00:28:42,086 --> 00:28:43,075
That it?

739
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,678
-That-that's it?
-That's it.

740
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:45,984
Have you looked inside?

741
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:46,988
No.

742
00:28:47,091 --> 00:28:48,183
Do you have an ethical problem

743
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:49,624
with rifling through
a woman's purse?

744
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,922
Uh, yeah, l guess l do.

745
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,657
Well, it's hardly a purse, dude.

746
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,722
lt's more like a clutch
or something.

747
00:28:54,765 --> 00:28:56,733
Guys, a woman's purse,
all right--

748
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:59,327
it's her secret source of power.
All right?

749
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,429
There-there are many dark
and dangerous things in there

750
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:04,669
that we, the male species,
should know nothing about.

751
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:08,770
Oh. Unless, of course, she, uh,
left it behind intentionally

752
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,940
to secure a next-day call back.

753
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:12,279
Mm-hmm.

754
00:29:12,316 --> 00:29:14,784
She's a very clever minx.

755
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,150
Oops, l'm sorry.
Oh, God. Um...

756
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,950
Oh, shit,
we got to clean that up.

757
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,080
Yeah, yeah.

758
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:23,059
Carefully. Carefully.

759
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:27,464
Oh, what have we here?

760
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:30,160
Let us see, let us see.

761
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,931
Oh... Knicks tickets...

762
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,267
Huh.

763
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,967
...for tonight's game.

764
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:38,870
Delivery, Andie.

765
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:40,137
Wow, look at those!

766
00:29:40,177 --> 00:29:41,610
Oh, who are those for?

767
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:42,613
Andie,

768
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:43,773
oh, my God!

769
00:29:43,814 --> 00:29:45,213
Where do you want these?

770
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:46,978
Who are these to?

771
00:29:47,084 --> 00:29:49,109
Wait. ''100 times...''

772
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:52,988
...more beautiful...''

773
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,286
Wait.

774
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,623
''...than 100 roses.''

775
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:57,628
Catchy.

776
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,789
The guy's in advertising.

777
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,263
He can't help it.

778
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:02,765
So, does this mean he's hooked?

779
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,735
This means he found
the Knicks tickets.

780
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,295
You left the tickets
in the purse?

781
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:09,499
Yeah.

782
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,134
You are just on a whole
different playing field.

783
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:14,478
Here you go.

784
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:15,979
Mm-hmm.

785
00:30:16,013 --> 00:30:17,173
Andie Anderson.

786
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:19,844
Hey, hey, pretty girl.

787
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,146
Guess what?

788
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:23,745
l got a really embarrassing
display of white roses.

789
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:24,914
Well, you are welcome.

790
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:27,014
Listen, l had a wonderful time
last night.

791
00:30:27,124 --> 00:30:29,115
l have your bag.

792
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,151
Ah, l know.

793
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:33,493
l can't believe l left it there.

794
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:38,860
Yeah, well, you must need it
back, what with all the cash,

795
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,131
credit cards, and...

796
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,503
those Knicks tickets
for tonight's game.

797
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,338
Sounds like you've been
peeking through my bag, Ben.

798
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:46,365
Oh, absolutely not.

799
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,241
Tony, my Art Director,
he's an oaf,

800
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,179
and he accidentally
knocked it over.

801
00:30:50,214 --> 00:30:51,203
Ow, right!

802
00:30:51,248 --> 00:30:53,375
Yeah, l'm a clumsy man.

803
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:55,044
All right, l'm sorry, though.

804
00:30:55,152 --> 00:30:56,380
l'm going to the game

805
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,819
with somebody else.

806
00:30:57,855 --> 00:30:59,049
Not anymore.

807
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,182
Besides, what?

808
00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:02,283
You think you left your purse
at my place by accident?

809
00:31:02,326 --> 00:31:04,123
No. Subconsciously,
you are dying

810
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:05,492
to take me to that game.

811
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:07,656
Denying your subconscious
desires

812
00:31:07,698 --> 00:31:09,723
is extremely dangerous
to your health, young lady.

813
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,826
Does that psycho-babble
really work on anybody?

814
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:13,632
You tell me.

815
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:15,898
Andie, you're so bad.

816
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,174
All right, meet me
at the 7th Avenue entrance.

817
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,510
7:30. Don't be late.

818
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:25,844
You got it. Bye-bye.

819
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:26,941
Bye.

820
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,712
And that's how it's done.

821
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:33,451
And that's how it's done.

822
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:41,459
Foul on Number 20,
Allan Houston.

823
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:44,392
Bullshit. Come on, ref!

824
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:45,424
What is that, ref?

825
00:31:45,469 --> 00:31:47,805
Hey, if you're going to call it,
call it both ways!

826
00:31:47,938 --> 00:31:51,032
Oh, you're soft, man!

827
00:31:51,108 --> 00:31:53,167
You were soft last year,
and you're still soft.

828
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,939
And he's 85% on the line
all year, too.

829
00:31:54,978 --> 00:31:56,275
What was that?

830
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:05,485
There we go.
One more left. All right.

831
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,357
Come on, bud.

832
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:15,524
Defense!

833
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:18,729
Oh, oh, oh!
That's off!

834
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:20,100
Defense!

835
00:32:21,305 --> 00:32:22,738
Knicks call. 20 second time out.

836
00:32:22,773 --> 00:32:25,970
All right, take your five.
Take a minute...

837
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:27,704
This is all right.

838
00:32:27,744 --> 00:32:31,202
Got 20 seconds.
20 second team.

839
00:32:31,248 --> 00:32:36,618
Kiss me,
down by the broken treehouse

840
00:32:36,653 --> 00:32:37,915
Swing me

841
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:41,857
Up on this hanging tire

842
00:32:41,892 --> 00:32:45,726
Bring, bring,
bring your flowered hat

843
00:32:45,762 --> 00:32:49,391
We'll take the trail
marked on your father's map

844
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:52,561
Oh, kiss me

845
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:55,436
Beneath the milky twilight

846
00:32:55,472 --> 00:33:00,409
Lead me,
out on the moonlit floor

847
00:33:00,444 --> 00:33:02,275
Lift your open hand.

848
00:33:02,312 --> 00:33:05,110
Knicks' ball.

849
00:33:08,318 --> 00:33:09,285
-Whoo!
-Bring it back.

850
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:10,251
Charge!

851
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:14,147
Work your arm, baby.

852
00:33:16,026 --> 00:33:17,493
Go, baby.

853
00:33:17,527 --> 00:33:18,494
Hold 'em up!

854
00:33:18,528 --> 00:33:19,495
Charge!

855
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:20,496
Benny?

856
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,827
Hold 'em up!
Work it, work it. Yeah?

857
00:33:21,865 --> 00:33:22,695
Benny, l'm kind
of thirsty.

858
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:23,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

859
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:25,292
-Yeah, yeah!
-Benny, could you get me a soda?

860
00:33:25,335 --> 00:33:26,734
Yeah, just let me
tell you right now...

861
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,862
l'm parched.

862
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,167
...there's a minute and nine
left in the game,

863
00:33:29,206 --> 00:33:31,504
-and then l'll go up and get it.
-l'm really thirsty.

864
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:32,667
l'll go get it.

865
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:35,303
Hey, hey, hey. You want...
you want it right now?

866
00:33:35,345 --> 00:33:36,471
Yeah.

867
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:39,004
And no ice, Ben.

868
00:33:39,082 --> 00:33:41,141
Thanks, Benny.

869
00:33:41,184 --> 00:33:43,015
Lawrence Funderburke.

870
00:33:43,086 --> 00:33:44,018
Oh, man!

871
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:48,022
Here's Sprewell with a fake.

872
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:50,686
Gets the step on Christie.
What a crossover...

873
00:33:50,727 --> 00:33:52,194
Whoo, my man.
Coke, no ice.

874
00:33:52,229 --> 00:33:53,389
Next line over, pal.

875
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,295
No ice. Hey, buddy?

876
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:58,324
Small coke, no ice.
Small coke, no ice.

877
00:33:58,368 --> 00:33:59,699
Okay, you got it.

878
00:33:59,736 --> 00:34:01,226
...beyond the three-point line,
fires!

879
00:34:01,271 --> 00:34:02,238
Ah... no!

880
00:34:02,272 --> 00:34:03,466
Man, don't let him have
that shot!

881
00:34:03,507 --> 00:34:05,065
No. Does that mean
no, you don't want ice,

882
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:06,075
or no, you want ice?

883
00:34:06,109 --> 00:34:07,974
No. No ice.
Coke, no ice.

884
00:34:08,011 --> 00:34:10,172
And Don Chaney
wants to talk it over...

885
00:34:10,213 --> 00:34:12,238
Oh, did you want a small?

886
00:34:12,282 --> 00:34:13,544
No, l-l want that one
right there.

887
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:15,141
You know, for 25 cents more,

888
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:16,152
you could get a jumbo?

889
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:17,517
Okay, you take that right there.

890
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:18,213
Keep the change.

891
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:19,381
All right.

892
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:24,727
Charge!

893
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:29,959
Excuse me.

894
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,228
Ah...

895
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:32,235
Excuse me.

896
00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:34,669
Come on! Score!

897
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:36,832
Come on, baby,
drive into the net!

898
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:37,862
Right there, right there.

899
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:39,102
Oh, thanks!

900
00:34:39,142 --> 00:34:41,110
Hey, hold him, hold him.
Move it.

901
00:34:41,144 --> 00:34:44,170
Set your pick! Watch
the three seconds! Traveling!

902
00:34:44,214 --> 00:34:45,340
Ben, it's not diet.

903
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:46,940
-Huh? What?
-Ben, it's not diet.

904
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:49,384
Please, l'm so thirsty.

905
00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:50,852
-All right, all right.
-With a lime.

906
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:52,855
-All right, okay, l got it.
-With a lime. Okay.

907
00:35:01,398 --> 00:35:02,296
Shoot it!

908
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:05,230
Sprewell for the win!

909
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:06,235
Yes!

910
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:11,099
That was Sprewell!

911
00:35:11,141 --> 00:35:12,369
lt's all over!

912
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:14,377
The Knicks
have defeated the Kings

913
00:35:14,411 --> 00:35:16,106
in the final seconds...

914
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,614
...Sprewell with
the game-winning shot,

915
00:35:19,649 --> 00:35:24,086
and the Knicks over Sacramento:
97 to 96.

916
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:27,784
Oh, what an incredible game.

917
00:35:27,824 --> 00:35:31,760
l've never seen a more exciting
game-ending play before.

918
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:34,889
Wow, well, neither have l.

919
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:35,989
Hey, hey, hey.

920
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:38,126
lt's too bad you missed it.

921
00:35:38,168 --> 00:35:40,602
Yep, it's too bad.

922
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:41,763
One second.

923
00:35:43,907 --> 00:35:46,239
So...

924
00:35:46,276 --> 00:35:48,301
you as nice as you seem, Ben?

925
00:35:50,914 --> 00:35:51,972
No.

926
00:35:56,186 --> 00:35:57,676
Good. Neither am l.

927
00:35:57,721 --> 00:35:59,416
Oh, here.

928
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:02,954
Fifth and 12th, please.

929
00:36:02,993 --> 00:36:05,052
See you later.

930
00:36:10,734 --> 00:36:12,497
Horseshit.

931
00:36:12,536 --> 00:36:13,798
More horseshit.

932
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:16,806
The horseshit continues.

933
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,707
Horseshit. Come on, people.

934
00:36:19,743 --> 00:36:21,142
We've got to do a lot better
than this

935
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:22,145
if we're going to com...

936
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:23,339
What?!

937
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,439
There's a phone call
for Mr. Barry.

938
00:36:25,482 --> 00:36:27,109
Yeah, can you take a message,
Candi?

939
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,015
Uh, Mr. Barry, it's Andie.

940
00:36:31,154 --> 00:36:33,122
-Make it quick.
-l will.

941
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:35,488
lt's line two, Mr. Barry.

942
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:36,514
Thank you.

943
00:36:39,663 --> 00:36:40,630

Mm-hmm.

You busy tonight?

Uh, no. No, l'm not.

953
00:36:57,347 --> 00:36:59,542
Why don't we catch a movie
or somethin'?

954
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:00,709
A movie-- my choice?!

955
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,717
Your choice.

956
00:37:01,751 --> 00:37:03,946
Oh, l'm so excited!

Bye.

960
00:37:13,263 --> 00:37:15,823
Jonah!

961
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:16,833
Dad!

962
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,858
l always wanted a man
like Tom Hanks.

963
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:23,465
lt's my favorite movie
of all time.

964
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:24,804
Yeah, me, too.

965
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:25,808
Shh!

966
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:28,470
What if something
happened to you?

967
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:32,539
What if l couldn't get to you?

968
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:34,072
What are you thinking about?

969
00:37:34,117 --> 00:37:35,744
Nothing. l'm watching the movie.

970
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,479
Yeah, but what's on your mind?

971
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:39,648
Shh!

973
00:37:41,858 --> 00:37:45,487
Oh, so l suppose your mind
is a complete blank.

974
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,997
You are my family,
you're all l have.

975
00:37:48,064 --> 00:37:49,088
Who is she?

976
00:37:49,132 --> 00:37:51,123
Shh!

977
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,465
Who's who?

978
00:37:52,502 --> 00:37:54,094
The girl you're thinking about.

979
00:37:54,137 --> 00:37:55,229
Can't hear.

980
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:57,263
-l'm not thinking about a girl.
-Aah!

981
00:37:57,307 --> 00:37:58,740
You can't watch Meg Ryan

982
00:37:58,775 --> 00:37:59,742
-for two hours
-Shh!

983
00:37:59,776 --> 00:38:01,676
and not be thinking
about another girl.

984
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:03,178
Uh...

985
00:38:03,213 --> 00:38:05,579
You want to know what
l'm thinking about?

986
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:06,741
Yes.

987

about how damn beautiful
you are.

989
00:38:11,788 --> 00:38:13,483
That's what l'm thinking about.

990
00:38:13,523 --> 00:38:15,957
Come on, let's watch this movie,
it's good.

991
00:38:15,992 --> 00:38:19,951
Aww...

992
00:38:19,996 --> 00:38:21,691
Benji.

993
00:38:25,101 --> 00:38:27,729
Oh, sweetie!

994
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:29,534
l love sharing this with you.

995
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:30,540
Yeah.

996
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:31,939
Can't hear and can't see.

997
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:34,569
lf you don't shut up,
my boyfriend over here

998
00:38:34,611 --> 00:38:35,771
is going to come back there

999
00:38:35,812 --> 00:38:37,780
and pummel your ass.

1000
00:38:37,814 --> 00:38:38,872
Put a muzzle on your old lady

1001
00:38:38,915 --> 00:38:40,473
the next time
you bring her out in public.

1002
00:38:40,517 --> 00:38:41,449
What?!

1003
00:38:41,484 --> 00:38:42,451
What is that?!

1004
00:38:42,485 --> 00:38:43,452
Do something about...

1005
00:38:43,486 --> 00:38:44,817
-You, outside.
-Shh!

1006
00:38:44,854 --> 00:38:45,980
Keep it down!

1007
00:38:46,022 --> 00:38:48,513
Keep it down!

1008
00:38:48,558 --> 00:38:50,150
l mean, have a little class,
all right?

1009
00:38:50,193 --> 00:38:52,423
You want to talk like that
to me, we can work it out,

1010
00:38:52,462 --> 00:38:53,656
but not to a lady, all right?

1011
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:55,289
Ben, Ben, B-B-Ben, he's huge.

1012
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:57,926
l got it. l'm not looking to get
in a fight with the guy, okay?

1013
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,333
He owes you an apology.

1014
00:39:00,403 --> 00:39:02,803
Oh! Oh, whoa!

1015
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:04,773
Now, l'm going to go
back inside,

1016
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:07,299
and finish watching
Sleepless in Seattle.

1017
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:08,606
Nobody screw with me.

1018
00:39:08,645 --> 00:39:10,613
Son of a... bitch.

1019
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:12,046
-Oh, Ben.
-Aah!

1020
00:39:12,082 --> 00:39:13,049
Are you okay?

1021
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,380
-Oh...
-Ben,

1022
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:15,384
-Ben, Ben,
-Ow, ah-ah-ah. Yes?

1023
00:39:15,418 --> 00:39:16,612
Maybe we should
get you to a hospital.

1024
00:39:16,653 --> 00:39:17,620
No. No, no, no, no.

1025
00:39:17,654 --> 00:39:18,922
No, you could have a...
Excuse me!

1026
00:39:19,055 --> 00:39:20,488
Uh-uh-uh, hey, hey,
can you hold still,

1027
00:39:20,523 --> 00:39:21,615
right there, hold still?

1028
00:39:21,658 --> 00:39:22,784
Okay, l'm sor...

1029
00:39:22,825 --> 00:39:25,350
Oh, ooh... oh.

1030
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:26,362
Oh, yeah.

1031
00:39:26,396 --> 00:39:27,363
That's feeling real nice.

1032
00:39:27,397 --> 00:39:28,364
Ben... Ben...

1033
00:39:28,398 --> 00:39:29,558
l'm starting to feel
a little better.

1034
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,691
Ben...

1035
00:39:31,868 --> 00:39:33,335
Ben!

1036
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:34,927
Oh, my God!

1037
00:39:34,971 --> 00:39:36,199
You're fine.

1038
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:38,799
Oh, you are totally fine.

1039
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:41,704
Okay, come on, Rocky.

1040
00:39:41,744 --> 00:39:42,711
No, no...

1041
00:39:42,745 --> 00:39:43,677
Get up.

1042
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:47,405
Ouch. Huh?

1043
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,576
Yeah.

1044
00:39:48,618 --> 00:39:49,585
Hey, don't feel bad.

1045
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:51,246
lf l had a nickel for every time

1046
00:39:51,287 --> 00:39:53,721
l got in a fist fight
during a chick flick, whoo!

1047
00:39:53,756 --> 00:39:55,155
Uh-huh, right.
lt really wasn't that bad.

1048
00:39:55,191 --> 00:39:56,488
Really?

1049
00:39:56,526 --> 00:39:58,994
No. l mean, the getting punched
in the face part sucked, right?

1050
00:39:59,028 --> 00:40:00,256
Well...

1051
00:40:00,296 --> 00:40:03,094
But the getting taken care of
after the punch-- it was nice.

1052
00:40:03,132 --> 00:40:05,327
All right! Florence
Nightingale syndrome, yeah.

1053
00:40:05,368 --> 00:40:07,632
You want me to tape the game
for you tonight?

1054
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,297
No need, my friend.

1055
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:10,829
l'll be watching the Knicks

1056
00:40:10,873 --> 00:40:13,341
from the comfort of my
own home this evening.

1057
00:40:13,376 --> 00:40:15,503
-How'd you swing that?
-Oh, yeah.

1058
00:40:15,545 --> 00:40:16,842
What's good to grill?

1059
00:40:16,879 --> 00:40:17,903
-No.
-Heavyweight.

1060
00:40:17,947 --> 00:40:19,380
You're making the lamb.

1061
00:40:19,415 --> 00:40:20,382
Voila.

1062
00:40:20,416 --> 00:40:22,680
A woman loves a man
who can cook, yeah?

1063
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:23,981
Bringing out the big guns.

1064
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,282
-Let's go deep.
-l like it.

1065
00:40:25,321 --> 00:40:27,414
Why do they always
forget my bacon?

1066
00:40:27,457 --> 00:40:30,392
l can't believe
you got that guy knocked out.

1067
00:40:30,426 --> 00:40:32,394
Only for a few seconds.

1068
00:40:32,428 --> 00:40:38,025
He was the most adorable,
unconscious man ever. Mm-hmm.

1069
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:41,696
Are you dating him, or are you
contemplating adoption?

1070
00:40:43,439 --> 00:40:46,533
Andie, l am loving
your notes on this piece.

1071
00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:50,369
Thank you, Lana.

1072
00:40:50,413 --> 00:40:51,744
When are you seeing him again?

1073
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:53,578
Tonight.

1074
00:40:53,616 --> 00:40:56,141
He's invited me over for dinner.

1075
00:40:56,185 --> 00:40:59,916
Marvelous. l've got
a feeling about this one.

1076
00:40:59,956 --> 00:41:01,446
Thanks, Lana.

1077
00:41:01,491 --> 00:41:03,823
l hate it when she pops
her head in like that.

1078
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,327
Ahem!
l never noticed it.

1079
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:06,919
l heard that.

1080
00:41:06,963 --> 00:41:10,421
And Andie, tonight,
take smaller bites.

1081
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:14,996
Oh, my God!

1082
00:41:15,104 --> 00:41:18,073
Disgusting.
l can barely eat over here.

1083
00:41:20,843 --> 00:41:22,743
You know you could've
been a candle

1084
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:24,246
Come on in. Door's open.

1085
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,907
l'm holding you so tight

1086
00:41:25,948 --> 00:41:27,711
You know you could've been
a handgun

1087
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,581
-Hi.
-Hey, there.

1088
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:31,587
l hope you brought
your appetite, girl.

1089
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:32,588
Whew.

1090
00:41:32,622 --> 00:41:34,249
We got a feast tonight.

1091
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,257
Hmm.

1092
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:37,623
-And baby so, so sweeted
-Mmm...

1093
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,787
Oh...

1094
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:41,524
You know you could've been
some bird food Benny,

1095
00:41:41,564 --> 00:41:42,531
isn't that sweet?

1096
00:41:42,565 --> 00:41:43,532
Hmm?

1097
00:41:43,566 --> 00:41:45,966
Go on and pour yourself
a glass of wine.

1098
00:41:46,002 --> 00:41:47,663
We got diner in about five

1099
00:41:47,703 --> 00:41:49,671
and tip-off in about eight.

1100
00:41:49,705 --> 00:41:51,536
Great. l'm starving.

1101
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:53,041
The way you do
the things you do

1102
00:41:53,076 --> 00:41:55,044
As pretty as you are
Ah...

1103
00:41:55,111 --> 00:41:56,043
Mmm...

1104
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,546
You know you could've
been a flower

1105
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,547
Ah...

1106
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:02,312
lf looks were minutes

1107
00:42:02,351 --> 00:42:04,182
You know you could've
been an hour

1108
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,517
Oh...

1109
00:42:05,555 --> 00:42:07,523
Well, you could've
been anything you wanted to

1110
00:42:07,557 --> 00:42:08,990
So perfectly pink!

1111
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:11,356
l can tell you

1112
00:42:11,394 --> 00:42:14,659
The way you do the things
you do, all right

1113
00:42:14,697 --> 00:42:17,188
The way you do
the things you do

1114
00:42:20,937 --> 00:42:25,431
Pour la piece de resistance.

1115
00:42:25,475 --> 00:42:27,306
Ah...

1116
00:42:29,245 --> 00:42:30,712
Sheryl, Tori,

1117
00:42:30,746 --> 00:42:35,774
Sinead, Jewel, Fiona, Carly--
gang's all here!

1118
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:38,316
Great.

1119
00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:41,152
Got two minutes to game time.

1120
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:44,819
You walked into the party

1121
00:42:44,861 --> 00:42:49,025
Like you were walking
onto a yacht

1122
00:42:49,098 --> 00:42:54,593
You had strategically dipped
below one eye

1123
00:42:54,637 --> 00:42:58,038
Your scarf-- it was apricot

1124
00:42:58,107 --> 00:43:00,769
Wow. Look at all this stuff.

1125
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:03,176
-You had one eye in the mirror
-Those are cute and...

1126
00:43:03,212 --> 00:43:05,544
-As you watched
-l saw the...

1127
00:43:05,581 --> 00:43:08,209
-Yourself gavotte
-the new comforter.

1128
00:43:08,251 --> 00:43:10,378
And all the girls dreamed that

1129
00:43:10,419 --> 00:43:13,946
They'd be Ben's partner,
they'd be Ben's partner

1130
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,788
And you're so vain
What you got in the box?

1131
00:43:16,826 --> 00:43:18,555
Oh.

1132
00:43:18,594 --> 00:43:20,721
You probably think
this song is about you

1133
00:43:20,763 --> 00:43:22,162
lt's a baby fern.

1134
00:43:22,198 --> 00:43:23,995
Really? Oh, yeah?

1135
00:43:24,033 --> 00:43:25,796
Just like our relationship.

1136
00:43:25,835 --> 00:43:29,532
A helpless little baby
in need of tender loving care.

1137
00:43:29,572 --> 00:43:31,506
Don't you? Don't you?

1138
00:43:32,708 --> 00:43:33,675
Thank you.

1139
00:43:33,709 --> 00:43:35,540
You had me several years ago

1140
00:43:35,578 --> 00:43:36,670
-Turn it down.
-Ooh!

1141
00:43:36,712 --> 00:43:38,236
Okay, let's check out
the starting line

1142
00:43:38,281 --> 00:43:39,248
Have a seat.

1143
00:43:39,282 --> 00:43:40,579
for the New York Knicks.

1144
00:43:40,616 --> 00:43:42,914
-At the point, Latrell Sprewell
-Get ready. Mm-hmm.

1145
00:43:42,952 --> 00:43:46,786
Game two. Welcome to
the front row, madam.

1146
00:43:46,822 --> 00:43:49,290
Oh, oh. Here.

1147
00:43:49,325 --> 00:43:52,123
Mm-mm-mm, mm-hmm.

1148
00:43:52,161 --> 00:43:53,458
Dinner is served.

1149
00:43:53,496 --> 00:43:55,964
Chef's special tonight.

1150
00:43:55,998 --> 00:43:57,989
Lamb with a cherry glaze.

1151
00:43:58,034 --> 00:44:01,970
Start you off
with the main dish

1152
00:44:02,038 --> 00:44:04,029
right about there.

1153
00:44:05,408 --> 00:44:07,672
A few carrots.

1154
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,678
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

1155
00:44:09,712 --> 00:44:11,179
You okay?

1156
00:44:11,214 --> 00:44:13,114
lt's beautiful.

1157
00:44:15,551 --> 00:44:16,848
Thanks.

1158
00:44:16,886 --> 00:44:18,183
You're beautiful.

1159
00:44:18,221 --> 00:44:19,984
The game, the whole thing.

1160
00:44:22,058 --> 00:44:25,687
l wish l ate meat.

1161
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:31,091
Mary had a little lamb

1162
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:32,725
Little lamb...

1163
00:44:35,004 --> 00:44:37,131
You have to take it away
before l gag.

1164
00:44:40,509 --> 00:44:42,977
This stuff's for cows.

1165
00:44:47,516 --> 00:44:48,847
-Hi.
-Hi.

1166
00:44:48,884 --> 00:44:50,181
How you doing?

1167
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:53,416
Oh, aw, it's just
a little indigestion.

1168
00:44:53,456 --> 00:44:55,014
-You okay?
-Mm-hmm.

1169
00:44:55,124 --> 00:44:56,148
All right.

1170
00:44:56,192 --> 00:44:57,784
Uh, excuse me, m'am?

1171
00:44:57,827 --> 00:45:00,159
Do you happen to know the
score of the Knicks game?

1172
00:45:00,196 --> 00:45:01,788
Do l look like
the kind of person

1173
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:03,696
who knows the score
of a Knicks game?

1174
00:45:03,733 --> 00:45:05,633
No, you don't.

1175
00:45:07,436 --> 00:45:11,395
ls something wrong
with the barley?

1176
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,840
No, no.

1177
00:45:18,447 --> 00:45:21,507
My boyfriend thinks l'm fat!

1178
00:45:23,085 --> 00:45:26,384
And l can't eat
in front of him!

1179
00:45:26,422 --> 00:45:27,821
l can't eat in front of you!

1180
00:45:27,857 --> 00:45:30,655
-l have to go to the bathroom.
-l don't think you're...

1181
00:45:30,693 --> 00:45:32,388
l don't think you're fat.

1182
00:45:35,898 --> 00:45:38,093
l don't think she's fat.

1183
00:45:47,743 --> 00:45:48,869
What's happening?

1184
00:45:48,911 --> 00:45:51,345
Spre just turned up;
23 seconds left.

1185
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,847
Knicks' ball.

1186
00:45:52,882 --> 00:45:54,179
Get the ball, man.

1187
00:45:54,216 --> 00:45:55,410
Oh, come on!

1188
00:45:55,451 --> 00:45:56,008
Throw it!

1189
00:45:57,053 --> 00:45:58,350
Oh! That was in!

1190
00:45:58,387 --> 00:45:59,445
-Oh, man!
-Oh...

1191
00:45:59,488 --> 00:46:00,512
Come on, get it back.

1192
00:46:03,626 --> 00:46:04,593
Come on.

1193
00:46:04,627 --> 00:46:05,685
Get the ball back,
get the ball back!

1194
00:46:05,728 --> 00:46:07,252
Jackson takes the ball.

1195
00:46:07,296 --> 00:46:08,524
A spin by Jackson.

1196
00:46:08,564 --> 00:46:09,531
-Get it back!
-No!

1197
00:46:09,565 --> 00:46:10,691
Damn!

1198
00:46:10,733 --> 00:46:11,859
And the time has run out.

1199
00:46:11,901 --> 00:46:12,959
-Damn!
-Pick up!

1200
00:46:13,002 --> 00:46:14,492
The Kings have beaten
the Knicks.

1201
00:46:14,537 --> 00:46:15,970
Their first win in the series.

1202
00:46:16,038 --> 00:46:17,528
Next game.

1203
00:46:25,181 --> 00:46:27,149
Well, that was fun.

1204
00:46:27,183 --> 00:46:30,641
Okay. 11:25.

1205
00:46:30,686 --> 00:46:32,085
Sports.

1206
00:46:32,121 --> 00:46:33,418
Ah, there we are.

1207
00:46:33,455 --> 00:46:35,082
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1208
00:46:35,124 --> 00:46:38,457
Then it's Mark Jackson with
a no-look pass to Kirk Thomas...

1209
00:46:38,494 --> 00:46:39,791
Sorry we missed the game.

1210
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:41,660
Post, post. Reverse it!

1211
00:46:41,697 --> 00:46:44,393
30 seconds left in the game,
Sprewell...

1212
00:46:44,433 --> 00:46:45,127
There we go, baby!

1213
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:46,464
Oh, l can't believe

1214
00:46:46,502 --> 00:46:47,901
he missed that shot.

1215
00:46:47,937 --> 00:46:49,234
Take it, take it!

1216
00:46:49,271 --> 00:46:51,671
-12 seconds left, the game...
-Pitch! Aah!

1217
00:46:51,707 --> 00:46:53,834
How the hell did you know
he was going to miss that shot?

1218
00:46:53,876 --> 00:46:55,639
...with a narrow Monroe move.

1219
00:46:55,678 --> 00:46:57,441
He always misses... the shot

1220
00:46:57,479 --> 00:46:59,242
-...the way it ended...
-from the top of the key.

1221
00:46:59,281 --> 00:47:01,749
...as the Knicks
could not get off another shot.

1222
00:47:03,586 --> 00:47:06,282
Aah, man.

1223
00:47:07,823 --> 00:47:09,017
Houston never misses

1224
00:47:09,057 --> 00:47:11,150
from the top of the key.

1225
00:47:17,799 --> 00:47:19,164
Oh!

1226
00:47:19,201 --> 00:47:21,101
-Whoa.
-Mmm...

1227
00:47:22,471 --> 00:47:24,962
Does Princess Sophia
want to come out and play?

1228
00:47:25,073 --> 00:47:28,338
Who's Princess Sophia?

1229
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,470
-No, no, no, no... no!
-Ow!

1230
00:47:33,515 --> 00:47:34,982
Aw, yo-yo-yo-you...

1231
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:36,983
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
y-you're kidding me, right?

1232
00:47:37,085 --> 00:47:38,552
Princess Sophia?

1233
00:47:38,587 --> 00:47:40,418
Little, big, little,
big, l don't know.

1234
00:47:40,455 --> 00:47:41,683
We will find out!

1235
00:47:41,723 --> 00:47:43,190
Ah, you know,
hang on a second.

1236
00:47:43,225 --> 00:47:44,157
Ah, no, no.

1237
00:47:45,894 --> 00:47:47,156
All right, listen.

1238
00:47:47,195 --> 00:47:49,663
You can't name my... my member

1239
00:47:49,698 --> 00:47:51,359
Princess Sophia.
lt doesn't...

1240
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,799
Yes, l can.

1241
00:47:52,834 --> 00:47:53,994
Listen. L-L-Listen to me.

1242
00:47:54,069 --> 00:47:56,503
lf-lf you're going to name...
my member, all right,

1243
00:47:56,538 --> 00:47:59,006
you got to name it something
hyper-masculine, okay?

1244
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:01,805
Something like Spike or Butch,
or Krull, the Warrior King,

1245
00:48:01,843 --> 00:48:02,935
but not Princess Sophia.

1246
00:48:03,045 --> 00:48:04,239
What did you just say?

1247
00:48:04,279 --> 00:48:06,839
Spike.

1248
00:48:06,882 --> 00:48:08,213
You know what l mean?

1249
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:10,343
No, no, after Spike.

1250
00:48:10,385 --> 00:48:11,181
Butch.

1251
00:48:11,219 --> 00:48:12,709
After Butch.

1252
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:18,086
Krull... Krull,
the Warrior King.

1253
00:48:18,126 --> 00:48:23,723
Does Kr-rull, the Warrior King
want to come out and play?

1254
00:48:25,067 --> 00:48:26,329
-Oh, come on...
-No.

1255
00:48:27,736 --> 00:48:30,864
...Krull.

1256
00:48:30,906 --> 00:48:32,840
You know what?

1257
00:48:32,874 --> 00:48:34,205
Due to...

1258
00:48:34,242 --> 00:48:37,336
intense humiliation,
the King has...

1259
00:48:37,379 --> 00:48:39,904
momentarily abdicated
his throne.

1260
00:48:39,948 --> 00:48:41,973
-Okay?
-Oh, uh-oh!

1261
00:48:42,017 --> 00:48:43,541
Yeah.

1262
00:48:43,585 --> 00:48:45,985
Well, in that case...

1263
00:48:46,088 --> 00:48:47,953
l'd better get going.

1264
00:48:51,727 --> 00:48:53,854
Take care of our love fern,
honey.

1265
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:14,949
Hi. Mm.

1266
00:49:14,983 --> 00:49:16,143
Can l see you tomorrow?

1267
00:49:16,184 --> 00:49:17,742
Really?

1268
00:49:17,786 --> 00:49:19,378
l hope so.

1269
00:49:20,789 --> 00:49:21,915
Call me.

1270
00:49:21,957 --> 00:49:22,924
l will.

1271
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:23,947
And l'll call you.

1272
00:49:23,992 --> 00:49:24,959
Sweet dreams.

1273
00:49:24,993 --> 00:49:26,961
Answer your phone!

1274
00:49:26,995 --> 00:49:28,326
What?

1275
00:49:30,332 --> 00:49:31,299
What was ''icy'' again?

1276
00:49:31,533 --> 00:49:34,627
''Arctic, freezing, frigid.''

1277
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:36,137
How about ''glitter''?

1278
00:49:36,171 --> 00:49:37,968
Thayer's favorite movie.

1279
00:49:38,006 --> 00:49:39,166
lt was underrated.

1280
00:49:39,207 --> 00:49:40,367
Huh?

1281
00:49:40,409 --> 00:49:42,775
''Glint, glisten,
scintillation.''

1282
00:49:42,811 --> 00:49:44,972
''Scintillation--''
that's not bad.

1283
00:49:45,013 --> 00:49:46,173
Aw, that sucks.

1284
00:49:46,214 --> 00:49:47,545
Guys, let's take a break.

1285
00:49:47,582 --> 00:49:49,447
Huh? A little coffee
and nine-ball.

1286
00:49:49,484 --> 00:49:50,610
Shake it out.

1287
00:49:50,652 --> 00:49:52,847
Maybe l'll be able
to concentrate

1288
00:49:52,888 --> 00:49:55,652
since the woman
is driving me crazy.

1289
00:49:55,691 --> 00:49:57,659
Which woman-- Andie,
or Princess Sophia?

1290
00:49:57,693 --> 00:49:58,660
-Ah!
-Uh-huh.

1291
00:49:58,694 --> 00:49:59,991
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1292
00:50:00,028 --> 00:50:00,995
Wait a second.

1293
00:50:01,029 --> 00:50:02,997
l thought you said
after the Knicks game

1294
00:50:03,098 --> 00:50:04,326
that she was a goddess.

1295
00:50:04,366 --> 00:50:06,834
Oh, she was. That was
the good Andie, guys.

1296
00:50:06,868 --> 00:50:08,893
This amazing, fun,
cool, sexy woman.

1297
00:50:08,937 --> 00:50:11,167
l'm talking
about the evil Andie, now.

1298
00:50:11,206 --> 00:50:12,332
lt's like a...

1299
00:50:12,374 --> 00:50:15,002
it's like a crack-enhanced
Kathie Lee Gifford.

1300
00:50:15,043 --> 00:50:16,772
She... she's
probably bipolar.

1301
00:50:16,812 --> 00:50:19,337
Well, her South Pole's
definitely prevailing.

1302
00:50:19,381 --> 00:50:23,317
Well, all you gotta do
is rock it for five more days.

1303
00:50:23,351 --> 00:50:24,318
Muffin!

1304
00:50:24,352 --> 00:50:26,013
Which shouldn't be
too difficult.

1305
00:50:26,054 --> 00:50:27,316
-Hi!
-Andie!

1306
00:50:27,355 --> 00:50:28,686
-My little muffin.
-Hey, sweetie.

1307
00:50:28,724 --> 00:50:30,021
We were just talking about you.

1308
00:50:30,058 --> 00:50:31,286
- Hi.
-Hello, there.

1309
00:50:31,326 --> 00:50:33,021
How are you?
You look gorgeous.

1310
00:50:33,061 --> 00:50:34,028
Oh, thank you.

1311
00:50:34,062 --> 00:50:35,689
Andie, this is Tony,
and this is Thayer.

1312
00:50:35,731 --> 00:50:36,698
-Oh, yes.
-Hey.

1313
00:50:36,732 --> 00:50:38,563
Benny Wenny's told me
so much about you two.

1314
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,194
Oh, well, Benny Wenny's said
wonderful things about you, too.

1315
00:50:41,236 --> 00:50:42,362
Oh...

1316
00:50:42,404 --> 00:50:44,235
Oh, they don't look
so simple-minded.

1317
00:50:44,272 --> 00:50:45,398
Honey,

1318
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,407
Hmm?

1319
00:50:46,441 --> 00:50:47,408
Look what

1320
00:50:47,442 --> 00:50:48,534
l got for us. Oh.

1321
00:50:49,711 --> 00:50:50,871
Look at that.

1322
00:50:51,947 --> 00:50:53,539
Oh, wow!

1323
00:50:53,582 --> 00:50:55,209
-Ooh!
-Look at him go. What is it?

1324
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,740
Jumper.

1325
00:50:56,785 --> 00:50:59,185
lt's a Chinese Crested,
of course.

1326
00:50:59,221 --> 00:51:00,347
No kidding.

1327
00:51:00,388 --> 00:51:02,151
-A Chinese Crested.
-Mm.

1328
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,987
So, it-it's like a dog, right?

1329
00:51:04,025 --> 00:51:04,855
Oh, hey.

1330
00:51:04,893 --> 00:51:05,882
There he is.

1331
00:51:05,927 --> 00:51:07,155
Ooh, Ben. Ben.

1332
00:51:07,195 --> 00:51:08,253
You got a dog.

1333
00:51:08,296 --> 00:51:09,524
You're hurting Krull's feelings.

1334
00:51:09,564 --> 00:51:10,258
Krull, is it?

1335
00:51:10,298 --> 00:51:12,823
Krull. Krull, the Warrior King.

1336
00:51:12,868 --> 00:51:14,995
Well, sure, 'cause
that's clearly what... Yeah.

1337
00:51:15,036 --> 00:51:16,003
Oh, oh, oh.

1338
00:51:16,037 --> 00:51:17,004
Oh, wait, there's more.

1339
00:51:17,038 --> 00:51:18,005
What do you got there?

1340
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:19,006
Oh, nice.

1341
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,007
-For me?
-Mm-hmm.

1342
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:21,668
-Get out of town.
-Try it on.

1343
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:23,735
That's like the...
inside of a raincoat.

1344
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:25,337
-Medium. Oh, yeah.
-lt matches! Try it on.

1345
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,644
Now, that is going to fit
nicely, sweetie, thank you.

1346
00:51:27,682 --> 00:51:28,649
No, Ben, put it on.

1347
00:51:28,683 --> 00:51:29,911
No, you should try
it on. Otherwise,

1348
00:51:29,951 --> 00:51:31,418
you don't know if it's
going to fit or...

1349
00:51:31,453 --> 00:51:32,420
Oh, go for it.

1350
00:51:32,454 --> 00:51:33,716
That has never hurt anybody.

1351
00:51:33,755 --> 00:51:35,347
Huh? Huh?
l was just gonna save it

1352
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:36,948
for a better occasion,
all right?

1353
00:51:36,992 --> 00:51:38,857
Check that out.

1354
00:51:38,894 --> 00:51:40,418
Oh, yeah, that's nice.

1355
00:51:40,462 --> 00:51:41,895
-Hey.
-Hmm?

1356
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:43,090
You're a vision in khaki.

1357
00:51:44,733 --> 00:51:47,566
lt's going to be
a happy little family,

1358
00:51:48,603 --> 00:51:50,127
Just the three of us.

1359
00:51:50,172 --> 00:51:52,265
We are, aren't we?

1360
00:51:52,307 --> 00:51:53,968
Wow.

1361
00:51:54,009 --> 00:51:55,772
He's our boy, Ben.

1362
00:51:55,811 --> 00:51:57,278
Oh, see, that's sweet.

1363
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,578
Mm-hmm, hey, mm-hmm.

1364
00:52:00,615 --> 00:52:02,378
Whoa, ho, ho, ho,
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1365
00:52:02,417 --> 00:52:04,715
Andie, hey, it's good
to see you, too, sweetie.

1366
00:52:04,753 --> 00:52:05,777
Ah, l got you.

1367
00:52:05,821 --> 00:52:06,913
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

1368
00:52:06,955 --> 00:52:07,922
Gotcha, gotcha,
gotcha, gotcha.

1369
00:52:07,956 --> 00:52:08,923
Oh...

1370
00:52:08,957 --> 00:52:10,925
He's just
not potty-trained yet.

1371
00:52:10,959 --> 00:52:12,256
-Whoa!
-Oh!

1372
00:52:12,294 --> 00:52:13,283
Okay, well, he's a pisser.

1373
00:52:15,197 --> 00:52:16,664
Come here, little tinkle king.

1374
00:52:16,698 --> 00:52:17,756
No, no, no.

1375
00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:18,925
Come here, tinkle king.

1376
00:52:18,967 --> 00:52:20,594
-He is a tinkle king.
-Oh, yeah.

1377
00:52:20,635 --> 00:52:22,432
Who's my little tinkler?
You tinkle tinkles.

1378
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:23,562
Well, congratulations,

1379
00:52:23,605 --> 00:52:24,629
little plaid family.

1380
00:52:24,673 --> 00:52:26,140
We, you know,
we got a whole bunch

1381
00:52:26,174 --> 00:52:27,664
of work we got to do,
but we're...

1382
00:52:27,709 --> 00:52:28,676
we're still on for poker

1383
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:29,802
at your house this weekend?

1384
00:52:29,845 --> 00:52:31,335
-Oh, you count on it.
-Whoo! Boys' night.

1385
00:52:31,379 --> 00:52:32,346
-Yeah.
-Whoo!

1386
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,347
Yeah, it was nice meeting you,

1387
00:52:33,381 --> 00:52:34,348
Nice to meet you.

1388
00:52:34,382 --> 00:52:35,349
And, of course, Krull.

1389
00:52:35,383 --> 00:52:36,509
-Bye. Say bye, Krullie.
-All right.

1390
00:52:36,551 --> 00:52:37,984
A little soap and water
will take that out.

1391
00:52:38,019 --> 00:52:38,986
He goes, ''Woof, woof.''

1392
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:39,952
Yeah, thank you, buds.

1393
00:52:41,056 --> 00:52:43,024
Oh, come here. Ooh.

1394
00:52:43,058 --> 00:52:44,457
Do you love him?

1395
00:52:44,492 --> 00:52:45,459
Oh, l do.

1396
00:52:45,493 --> 00:52:47,723
Oh, look at Krull's necklace.

1397
00:52:47,762 --> 00:52:51,027
He's got more ice than
Liberace, don't you?

1398
00:52:51,066 --> 00:52:52,795
Oh, it's just a little frosting.

1399
00:52:56,071 --> 00:52:57,629
Frosting?

1400
00:52:57,672 --> 00:53:00,266
Frosting.

1401
00:53:00,308 --> 00:53:01,332
We were thinking bold,

1402
00:53:01,376 --> 00:53:02,434
new, fresh.

1403
00:53:02,477 --> 00:53:04,638
''Frost yourself.''

1404
00:53:04,679 --> 00:53:05,646
Excuse me?

1405
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,840
''Frost yourself--''

1406
00:53:06,882 --> 00:53:08,577
The slogan for the campaign.

1407
00:53:08,617 --> 00:53:09,777
You frost a cake.

1408
00:53:09,818 --> 00:53:12,286
We're in the middle
of a meeting, Benjamin.

1409
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,618
l'm talking about diamonds.
They're frosting.

1410
00:53:14,656 --> 00:53:17,124
As in, ''Whoa, would you
check out her frosting?''

1411
00:53:17,158 --> 00:53:18,625
-Frost yourself.
-Frost yourself.

1412
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:19,991
How did you come up with it?

1413
00:53:20,028 --> 00:53:20,995
l got it off the woman

1414
00:53:21,029 --> 00:53:22,621
who is falling
madly in love with me.

1415
00:53:22,664 --> 00:53:23,631
Oh...

1416
00:53:23,665 --> 00:53:24,859
lt may have possibilities,

1417
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,767
but as far as the woman who's
falling madly in love with you,

1418
00:53:27,802 --> 00:53:29,326
l will decide that at the party.

1419
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:30,702
lf he can get her there.

1420
00:53:30,739 --> 00:53:34,140
Now, just think about it--
ladies, frost yourself.

1421
00:53:34,175 --> 00:53:35,904
Frost yourself.

1422
00:53:35,944 --> 00:53:37,468
Mm-hmm. We could introduce it
at the party.

1423
00:53:37,512 --> 00:53:38,171
lt-lt should be the theme.

1424
00:53:38,213 --> 00:53:38,679
Yes.

1425
00:53:38,713 --> 00:53:39,873
Everything frosted.

1426
00:53:39,915 --> 00:53:41,007
-All of it.
-Martini glasses.

1427
00:53:41,116 --> 00:53:42,014
Chandeliers.

1428
00:53:42,117 --> 00:53:43,744
Ah, jewels everywhere.

1429
00:53:43,785 --> 00:53:44,376
The women.

1430
00:53:44,419 --> 00:53:45,681
The whole party--

1431
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,187
a sparkling diamond.

1432
00:53:47,222 --> 00:53:48,780
All of it frosted.

1433
00:53:50,792 --> 00:53:52,487
Women of New York!

1434
00:53:52,527 --> 00:53:54,324
Frost yourselves!

1435
00:53:54,362 --> 00:53:56,762

Eh?

1467
00:54:53,754 --> 00:54:55,813
to composite our faces together

1468
00:54:55,857 --> 00:54:58,257
to see what our kids
would look like.

1469

Our... Family... Album!

You don't want
to see our children?

We don't have...
