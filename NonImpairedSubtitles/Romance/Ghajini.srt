1
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,132
 Brain is the most important
 organ ofthe human body.

2
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,203
 The most vital component
 in the human system.

3
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,140
 lt's the brain that controls
 every body part.

4
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,477
 Brain is the king of all
 human body parts.

5
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,901
 Patient Name: Sanjay Singhania

00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,903
 Symptom: Anti retrograde
 Amnesia Short term memory loss

7
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,904
 Hey, look at this one.

8
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,577
 This one's my project.

9
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,245
 No.

10
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,346
 Sir, but why?

11
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,413
 Forget this case.

12
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,916
 But it's such an interesting case.

13
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,852
 lnteresting yes,
 but it's also a police case.

14
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:14,486
 But...

15
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,089
 Sunita, you want me to
 call your parents?

16
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,758
 Fine, l won't take it up.

17
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,759
 But as medical students,
 we want to know.

18
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,763
 Okay...

19
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,766
 That is Sanjay Singhania.

20
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,271
 Hit on the head with an iron rod.

21
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,607
 After the incident,
 he lost his memory.

22
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,011
 He is unable to remember anything now.
 We call it short term memory loss.

23
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,950
 He remembers events for
 only about 15 minutes.

24
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,221
 Afterwards...

25
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,323
 he forgets everything.

26
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,892
 For example, he'd ask your name...

27
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,528
 and in 15 minutes he will
 have forgotten it.

28
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:59,529
 He recalls only fragments ofthe incident.
 But we can't say how much of it he remembers.

29
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,904
 Regular tasks like eating,
 drinking, driving, also his feelings...

30
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,879
 lie embedded in his
 sub-conscious mind.

31
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,150
 How does he go about
 his everyday routine?

32
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,720
 How does a child perform
 instructed tasks?

33
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,490
 By committing to memory,
 learning by rote.

34
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,262
 Or, byjotting things
 down in writing.

35
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,263
 Likewise, he remembers
 tasks by writing.

36
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,267
 What was that incident?
 Who assaulted him?

37
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,110
 This, no one knows.

38
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,111
 Unfortunately, he doesn't
 even recall a face.

39
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,951
 How can someone live on like this...
 l wonder, what he's doing this moment...

40
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:46,022
 Ghajini

41
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,734

45
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:49,072
 l must find him before the
 police gets to him.

46
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,378
 Where to?

47
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,718

 Mine.

00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,797
 Yes, l sold that ticket.

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,200
 What's written behind it?

74
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,639
 He paid me with a five hundred note.

75
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,640
 l didn't have change.
 So l wrote it on the back.

76
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,643
 He forgot to take the change ...
 hey, it must be him.

77
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,215
 Who...?

78
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,818
 This one always forgets.

79
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,819
 Sometimes he forgets to buy a ticket,
 sometimes it's the change.

80
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,090
 At times, he'll go on buying tickets.

81
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,227
 He keeps on asking the
 names of bus stops.

82
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:26,228

 lt's a fine line between
 vanity and confidence.

 Hi... am l too late?

191
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,465
 What life... filling in for a crowd...

00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:54,135

193
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,481

201
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,166

209
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,028
 This one...

210
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,030
 a hoarding on the terrace...

211
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,866
 will be visible from the fly-over.

212
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,200
 Looks okay to me.

213
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,201
 Who lives here?
 - A girl. Kalpana. We can approach her.

214
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,707
 Do that.

215
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,708
 Now what?
 - Battery problem.

216
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,546
 What's going on?
 Now it's the battery...

217
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,547
 Excuse me, can we talk to Kalpana-madam?
 - Kalpana isn't ''madam''. Plain Kalpana.

218
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,388
 And you are...?
 - We're from Air Voice.

219
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,726

 executive assistant.

220
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,564

 You want an ad film?

224
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,080
 We just want to see Kalpana madam.
 Mr Singhania has sent me here.

 Open the door, go in.

230
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,617
 Serve them tea and come out.

231
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,286
 Sorry, don't try to convince me.

232
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,123
 Your boss is enchanted?
 But so what?

233
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,124
 The proposition ought to be
 acceptable to me.

234
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,128
 lt's a matter of love...
 matter of love.

235
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:37,365
 Please madam, on behalf of my boss,
 l request.

236
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,036
 Please think it over.

237
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:43,037
 What's there to think over?
 You have heard my decision.

238
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,474
 Now leave, please.

239
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,812
 They're going.

240
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,823
 Madam, please...
 - Tell your boss, Kalpana is displeased.

241
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,496
 lfyou change your mind,

242
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,500
 here's my card.

243
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,337
 Do call.

244
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,338
 Okay

245
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,509
 Sorry... l'll get ready in two minutes.

246
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,411
 Madam, one minute...

247
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:22,679
 Madam...?

248
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,081
 Kalpana ji...

249
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:28,082
 Ji...?

250
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,521
 l apologise for intruding upon
 your personal affairs.

251
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,692
 But all of us heard whatever
 went on inside.

252
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,368
 Spot boy, find a chair for madam.

253
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,369
 Let me surmise what might've happened.

254
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,706
 Sanjay Singhania saw you somewhere.

255
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,544
 And when he saw you,

256
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,545
 it was love at first sight.
 Thereby hangs a question.

257
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,717
 He pins his hopes on a yes from you,
 it's why he sent his men to you.

258
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,057
 And you for one, are putting him away?
 Am l correct, madam? Correct?

259
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,733
 Yes, correct.

260
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,903
 Why are you spurning
 a fine proposition?

261
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,577
 Today, it's a man who owns Air Voice.
 Tomorrow, it'll be a Bill Gates.

262
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,414
 Am l to just to capitulate?
 After all, my choice matters!

263
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,919
 Think, what a wonderful
 opportunity it is!

264
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,257
 On a nod from you, our company will be
 transported to such heights!

265
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,594
 You must've done a deed of great virtue.
 Just say a prayer and take the plunge!

266
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,268
 Allow me... l'll call.
 - Sir...oh, but no...

267
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,107
 Ringing... talk.
 - Talk.

268
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,445
 Air Voice. Can l help you?

269
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,616
 Hello...

270
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,785
 This is Kalpana.

271
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,786
 Kalpana... who...?

272
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,724
 Oh, Kalpana ofthe terrace-hoarding?

273
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:17,725
 We found out about you.
 The house isn't yours.

274
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,464
 You haven't paid rent in two months.

275
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,467
 And you're playing hard to get?
 Get lost.

276
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,875
 That office is all shook-up!

277
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,876
 Keep talking.

278
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,813
 Go to your boss and tell him,

279
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,650
 Kalpana said yes.

280
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,662
 So what if it isn't gold?
 lt still shines.

281
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,663
 Nathumal Gendamal Jewellers.
 42 Link Road, Malad West.

282
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,500
 We have no branches.

283
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,004
 Mom, in whom do we trust?

284
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,341
 ln mother first, you must trust.
 Only another thing, everyone trusts.

285
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,847
 lt's our soap. Hamam.

286
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,532
 Sir... why must you...?

287
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,533
 lt doesn't matter, my child.

288
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,705
 Kalpana, l want to tell you
 about something.

289
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,376
 An ad film agent is coming here.

290
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,214
 He's into the big agencies.

291
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,549
 What if he gets to know that...

292
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,550
 Sanjay Singhania is romancing
 our lead model?

293
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,392
 Then...?

294
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,061
 lt'll be a great boost for us.

295
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,062
 How long will we keep
 making small films?

296
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,232
 Our company needs
 national clients.

297
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:06,903
 Sir, consider it done.

298
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,904
 Kalpana is like a magic wand!
 One flourish and yesterday's gone.

299
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,742
 Don't worry.

300
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,747
 Excuse me... l'm doing an article on
 struggling models for Mayapuri.

301
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,319
 Can l interview some models?
 - ln the green room.

302
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,592
 Excuse me...?
 - Oh, welcome.

303
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,597
 Be seated.
 - Thank you.

304
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,100
 My director said
 you'd be coming.

305
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,334
 Really?

306
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:41,335
 Setting up these sets
 takes so much time.

307
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,439
 And l got to get to the airport.
 Sanjay is flying in.

308
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,609
 Sanjay who?

309
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,344
 Sanjay Singhania.

310
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,613

311
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,949
 My lover.

312
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,118
 Sanjay Singhania?
 Your lover?

313
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,119
 Yes, you know... actually,

314
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,456
 we met at Delhi airport.

315
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,459
 l never knew he's Sanjay Singhania.
 ln the airport lobby, he kept staring at me.

316
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:11,365
 On the flight, he was on the seat beside me.
 Hi, l'm Sanjay Singhania... and l said hi.

317
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,473
 That's when l discovered who he is.

318
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,478
 One minute...
 can l write it down?

319
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,147
 Yes, why not?
 You won't believe this...

320
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,148
 From Delhi to Bombay,
 he talked non-stop.

321
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,485
 Plain chatter. l could only
 listen on.

322
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,156
 Then all of a sudden,

323
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,824
 l love you.

324
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,825
 Will you marry me?

325
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:40,862
 l say, are you silly.
 Are marriages made in thin air?

326
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,001
 Back in Bombay, l'm inundated
 with phone calls and smses.

327
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:51,405
 l never gave him much of a lift.

328
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:04,420
 ln the end, l took pity on him.

329
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:07,421
 So l decided to say yes.

330
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,765

 right inside Mayapuri.

331
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:18,766

 an affair with an aspiring model.

332
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,040

 Kalpana's own words.

333
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,041
 Two packs of ''MDH Masala'' free
 with this week's edition

334
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,387
 Hello...?

335
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,557
 l don't know who she is,
 l haven't even seen her face.

336
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,060
 Please don't disturb me.

337
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,232
 Hello...?

338
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,734
 lt's all lies.

339
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,404
 How do l know why
 she's saying all this?

340
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,405
 No, please talk to me later.

341
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,577
 No more calls.

342
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,914
 Does it have
 her photos?

343
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,915
 Neither yours, nor hers.

344
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,020
 l want to meet her. Find out.

345
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,438
 What do we do now?
 - lt's impossible. Do we return?

346
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,941
 Wait, let's see how we can go inside.

347
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:49,123
 Something happened...?
 - The children are here to see the museum.

348
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,461
 What are we to do?

349
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,304
 One second.

350
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,981
 Careful while you get
 your feet into it.

351
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,859
 So sweet.

352
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,699
 Bye.
 - Bye.

353
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,061
 Sir, should l go in?

354
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:35,062
 Wait here.

355
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:40,236
 Excuse me, who's Kalpana?
 - Up on the terrace.

356
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:43,237
 My name's Sachin. Like, Sachin Tendulkar.
 Recommend me, please.

357
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,809
 Congratulations for the good news.
 - Thank you.

358
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,810
 Excuse me... l'll see
 what l can do.

359
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,616
 Hello... thanks.

360
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,551
 Did you send the photographs?

361
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:58,552
 Excuse me.

362
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:02,458
 One second.

363
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:05,394
 Yes... l'll talk to you later.

364
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:08,395
 Yes?

365
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:09,732
 Kalpana...?

366
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:12,635
 Yes, l am... go on.

367
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:15,636
 l... read the news in Mayapuri.

368
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:22,576
 Not Mayapuri again... what a day of calls,
 autographs, photographs, bouquets, smses.

369
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:30,551
 l didn't tell my story for all this...
 Sanjay must be so annoyed.

370
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,389
 Sanjay...?

371
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:36,390
 Sanjay Singhania.

372
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:37,727
 Actually,

373
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:40,062
 we met at Delhi airport.

374
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:43,063
 l never knew he's Sanjay Singhania.

375
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,400
 ln the airport lobby,
 he kept staring at me.

376
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,472
 On the flight,
 he was on the seat beside me.

377
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:55,242
 Hi, l'm Sanjay Singhania...
 and l said hi.

378
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:00,314
 That's when l discovered who he is.
 From Delhi to Bombay, he talked non-stop.

379
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:08,923
 Plain chatter.
 l could only listen on.

380
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,160
 Then all of a sudden, ''l love you.''

381
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:16,630
 Will you marry me?

382
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:20,367
 l say, are you silly.
 Are marriages made in thin air?

383
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:25,308
 l said, no.

384
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,176
 He said, please.

385
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,945
 l said no, he kept on...
 please...

386
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:31,314
 l said, okay.

387
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:34,315
 How can you say no to
 such persistence?

388
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:38,855
 That was the long and short of it.

389
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,856
 This magazine had to print this
 and now everyone's after me,

390
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:45,226
 for recommendations,
 advertisements.

391
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:58,374
 Are you here for the ad shoot?

392
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,375
 Well l...

393
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:05,145
 Everyone wears suits for the auditions.

394
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:09,149
 Have you been selected for the ad?

395
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:12,989
 Do you want me to recommend you?

396
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,658
 But it's the talent that you need.

397
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:18,494
 Don't set your sights
 on Van Heusen Suitings.

398
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:21,495
 Do what comes your way,
 papads, mosquito coils.

399
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:24,901
 Catch this.

400
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,902
 Now let's hear you say,
 here's one for men.

401
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:32,006
 For the bounce in the hair for alpha males...
 a comb. Let's hear you say that.

402
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:51,859
 Never did it before?

403
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,596
 Very poor...
 got to put in hard work.

404
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,100
 Leave your number.
 lf anything comes up, l'll call.

405
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:09,977
 What's your number?

406
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,914
 96500 55555

407
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,255
 Air Voice?

408
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:20,890
 Same as mine.

409
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,892
 Crap.

410
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,927
 You don't find a network anywhere.

411
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:27,928
 l keep telling Sanjay, to try turning
 the antenna or something.

412
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,900
 lt may be his pocket borough,
 but it ought to meet some standard.

413
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,910
 Hi Anjali... one second...

414
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,911
 What did you say your name was?

415
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:45,381
 Sachin?

416
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:46,582
 Yes.

417
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:49,583
 Sachin, l'm a bit busy.
 lf something comes up, l'll call. Bye.

418
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:52,953
 Yes Anjali...

419
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:56,256
 you know what happened?
 Mayapuri just splashed my love story.

420
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,995
 And now all day, l've been inundated
 with calls, smses, oh, l'm drained.

421
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:05,099
 No! Actually,
 we only met at Delhi airport.

422
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:10,306
 On the flight,
 he was on the seat beside me.

423
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:13,307
 Hi, l'm Sanjay Singhania...
 and l said hi.

424
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:17,611
 From Delhi to Bombay,
 he talked non-stop.

425
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:23,183
 After completing law, l went to USA
 and l took my MBA at Harvard.

426
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:27,287
 l've been looking after this business
 since my father passed away.

427
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:31,225
 l strongly feel that technology has to reach
 people beyond social and economic barriers.

428
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,030
 And that's the goal of our company.

429
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 l'm so sorry... cellphones,
 l tell you...

430
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:41,904
 Excuse me.

431
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:42,705
 Hello?

432
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,807
 Hello, l'm Kalpana.

433
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:47,376
 Kalpana... which Kalpana?

434
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:50,377
 Kalpana... Sanjay Singhania's girlfriend.

435
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:54,181
 Oh l see... how have you been?

436
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:56,719
 l'm good.

437
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,587
 Will you do an underwear ad?

438
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:01,588
 Underwear?

439
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:06,662
 Along with you?

440
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:09,598
 lt's a men's only.

441
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,599
 Come over quickly.
 Take down the address.

442
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:14,837
 One minute.

443
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:17,838
 Mark... make a note of
 this address, please.

444
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,542
 Go on.

445
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:22,543
 Building 3. Chinchpokli Bunder.
 Khau Galli.

446
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:27,014
 Building 3. Chinchpokli Bunder. Khau Galli.
 - l beg your pardon, sir...?

447
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:32,888
 Chinchpokli Bunder. Khau Galli.

448
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:35,524
 Chi...?
 - Chinchpokli.

449
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:38,525
 Chinchbokli?
 - ...Pokli Bunder. Khau Galli.

450
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,763
 Khau... Galli.
 - Galli.

451
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:44,366
 Got it.
 - Thanks.

452
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:47,367
 Arrive in an autorickshaw,
 you'll make a nice impression.

453
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:51,405
 D'you have the money for it?
 - l'll manage.

454
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:52,842
 Fine.

455
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:55,843
 l'll be waiting for you.
 Bye.

456
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:04,218
 lt's just too hot today...
 - Are you new to Mumbai?

457
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,288
 Come in the rains, here rivers flow.

458
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,531
 Moron! Can't you drive properly?

459
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,166
 Sorry...

460
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:18,567
 Why are you saying sorry?

461
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:21,568
 Pedestrians are taking up roads,
 are we meant to fly?

462
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,940
 Drive carefully.

463
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:27,941
 Get out of my way.

464
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:31,912
 How much?
 - Forty Rupees.

465
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:43,125
 Boo

466
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:45,895
 You're gawking like a country bumpkin.

467
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:48,896
 The manager wants a new model.
 l thought ofyou.

468
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:53,901
 What's this ad about?

469
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:55,938
 Zorro elastic underwear.

470
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,939
 lfyou make it to this ad,
 you've made it.

471
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:02,142
 Just imagine yourself in
 your underwear...

472
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:05,279
 at every traffic junction in town,

473
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:08,348
 on sixty feet-by-forty feet banners!

474
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,454
 Your luck is going to change.

475
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:15,455
 Don't worry, you're getting selected.

476
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:18,627
 Can't l get any other ad?

477
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:21,297
 Yes... how about one
 on skin allergies?

478
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:22,164
 Allergies...?

479
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:25,165
 Salves, for ringworm infections.

480
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:28,302
 Then the first choice is better.
 - Okay.

481
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:30,573
 Hello ma'am!
 - Hi...

482
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:33,509
 You said you'd recommend me
 for the underwear ad...?

483
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:36,510
 The underwear is taken, how about ringworm?
 - l'll take anything, l want a break.

484
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:42,718
 That's the spirit.

485
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:43,485
 See?

486
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:44,520
 Come to the studio tomorrow morning.

487
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:47,521
 Thank you, ma'am !
 - You're welcome.

488
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:53,427
 Wait a minute.

489
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:59,266
 Uncle, where are you headed?
 - To the bus stop ahead.

490
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:02,769
 l'll take you there.

491
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:05,908
 l'll describe to you
 whatever's on the way.

492
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,843
 Okay.

493
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:10,844
 Four schoolgirls playing tic tac toe.

494
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,720
 A wife thrashing her husband.

495
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:22,956
 He has lost his shirt.

496
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:29,029
 That's a radio at the tea shop.

497
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,601
 We're crossing Sai Baba's temple.

498
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,109
 Now we're on the main road.

499
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:47,247
 You've reached your bus stop.

500
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,456
 l'm swayed

501
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:28,824
 She flew in...

502
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,659
 like a swirl ofwind

503
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,861
 With that first look,

504
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:35,130
 she held my eyes

505
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:36,298
 So unlikely,

506
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:38,133
 she's so different,

507
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:39,301
 so unique,

508
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:42,302
 so unpretentious,

509
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:45,240
 and just no attitude

510
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:48,241
 So, l'm swayed

511
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:53,347
 And a freshness fills my heart

512
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,352
 You're swayed when she flies
 in on a swirl ofwind

513
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:03,757
 And with that first look,
 oh how she holds your eyes

514
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:40,696
 The heart went aflutter,

515
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,898
 dancing to a new rhythm

516
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,067
 My feet faltered

517
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,003
 l swooned in ecstasy

518
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:50,606
 l stood each day, staring her way

519
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:53,041
 ln endless wake, moments stretch

520
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,943
 Twisting, turning, tossing, thinking

521
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:57,944
 Thinking, thinking ofyou

522
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:10,726
 Her images criss-cross my mind,

523
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:12,895
 awash in colours

524
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:15,864
 Like a gushing stream she flows,

525
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:18,865
 drenching me

526
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,939
 Her murmurs make music

527
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:30,811
 Her trivia are priceless

528
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:35,350
 Some innocence,
 sweet mischief

529
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:37,553
 Somewhat gossamer,
 some odd gloss

530
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:40,255
 At times bashful, then carefree

531
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:43,256
 There are seas in her, but how deep?

532
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:41,114
 Her words could make
 Spring blossom

533
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:48,588
 Her charm could make
 seasons spring

534
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:55,063
 Even her lies...

535
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:56,331
 are so endearing,

536
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:59,332
 she could make me believe
 illusions in all things

537
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,703
 Upon her many paths,
 praying, hoping, eager-eyed,

538
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:08,875
 musing fragrant shades of memories,
 l stand still and...

539
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,780
 Time stands stilled

540
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:48,348


541
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:27,322
 Good morning, sir!
 - Good morning.

542
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:30,323
 Sit down, my child. Guess what,
 our company is going to be famous.

543
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:34,162
 Thanks only to you...
 - Why are you thanking me?

544
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:37,163
 l've done something
 without asking you.

545
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:41,034
 Our company is throwing a
 big party on New Year's Eve.

546
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:44,873
 Oh, wow!

547
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:46,675
 Guess, who's the chief guest?

548
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:47,576
 Who...?

549
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:49,544
 Your boyfriend.

550
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:51,580
 The man who owns Air Voice.

551
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:54,581
 Sanjay Singhania.

552
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:56,518
 Sir...?

553
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:59,519
 And come what may,
 you must get him to come.

554
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:04,024
 l'm sure you can, so l went ahead and
 printed his name in the invitations.

555
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:09,362
 The biggest of agencies are coming,
 top ad film makers, producers, directors.

556
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:14,901
 On whose say-so have
 you printed his name?

557
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:18,204
 Where's the need to ask...?

558
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:21,143
 lt's the New Years Eve party.
 You're coming.

559
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:24,144
 He'll accompany you.
 - But l can't invite him!

560
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:27,215
 Why?

561
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:30,216
 We've... had a fight!

562
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:33,321
 You don't say!
 All invitations have been distributed.

563
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:36,091
 You've got to make up with him
 ... got to get him to the party.

564
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:37,926
 But how...?
 - Otherwise, l'll lose face.

565
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:40,927
 On whose say-so did you print this?

566
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:44,130
 l would've told you,
 but it slipped my mind.

567
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:47,967
 What you've done is so wrong,
 hundred percent wrong!

568
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:50,970
 Please, or you'll break everyone's heart.
 - Where will l get Sanjay Singhania?

569
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:55,241
 Everyone's dying to see him,
 not one of us has ever met him.

570
01:01:58,114 --> 01:01:59,681
 What...?

571
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:01,750
 What about what?

572
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:04,686
 Not one of us has ever met him?

573
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:07,687
 How could we?
 He has just returned from America.

574
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:10,092
 Then l just...
 must get him.

575
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:12,360
 Consider it done

576
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:15,361
 Kalpana is like a magic wand !
 One flourish and you've got your wish.

577
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:20,333
 Thank you very much

578
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:26,742
 Dialogue... dialogue!

579
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,743
 Hi, l'm Sanjay. Sanjay Singhania.

580
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,481
 Perfect.

581
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:34,282
 Very good.

582
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:35,383
 Mind it.

583
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:38,384
 At tonight's party,
 you're Sanjay Singhania.

584
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:43,456
 One second...

585
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:49,796
 Listen, that's a friend of mine.
 You'll pretend to be Sanjay Singhania.

586
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:54,167
 lf he's convinced,
 then you pass muster. Okay?

587
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:59,572
 Ready?

588
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:00,475
 Hi...

589
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:02,677
 Hush!

590
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:04,312
 What happened?

591
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:05,480
 Sanjay is here.

592
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:06,982
 Sanjay?

593
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:09,983
 Sanjay Singhania, my boyfriend.

594
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:26,332
 Where... is he?
 - Where are you looking...?

595
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:28,170
 Here!

596
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:29,237
 Sachin,

597
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:31,339
 meet Mr Sanjay.

598
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:34,340
 Hi, l'm Sanjay. Sanjay Singhania.

599
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:38,077
 What... who...?

600
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:40,849
 He is... Sanjay Singhania.

601
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:43,850
 Him...?

602
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:47,887
 Are you joking?
 Sanjay Singhania, and him?

603
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:05,974
 Stupid amateur, duffer, idiot!

604
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:07,976
 What did l do...?

605
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:10,977
 The big fish never put out their hands first.
 Why did you hold out your hand?

606
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:15,815
 So when do l shake hands?
 - You just don't do it!

607
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:19,652
 Go to hell, go do ads!
 You've ruined it all.

608
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:24,157
 ldiot!

609
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:26,461
 What happened?

610
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:29,462
 Sachin, shall l tell you something?

611
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:30,999
 What?

612
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,435
 You're going to be stunned...

613
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:34,336
 Try me.

614
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:37,337
 l'm not in love with Sanjay Singhania.

615
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:40,673
 What?

616
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:43,311
 Actually,

617
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:45,313
 everyone at my workplace thought...

618
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:47,883
 he's my boyfriend.

619
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,884
 So, everyone began to respect me.

620
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,555
 l played along.

621
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:59,125
 l don't even know what he looks like!

622
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:04,132
 So... what's next?

623
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:06,268
 My boss is hosting a party tonight.

624
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:09,269
 Without even asking me, they sent out
 invites naming Sanjay as the chief guest.

625
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:13,006
 So l was preparing this mule for tonight,
 but you caught him out in a second!

626
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,578
 What am l going to do now?

627
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:21,850
 Relax... l'm right here for you.

628
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:24,753
 l'll train him.

629
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,922
 Listen... what's your name?

630
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,923
 Hi, l'm Sanjay. Sanjay Singhania.
 - No... your real name?

631
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:35,163
 Sampat.
 - Look Sampat...

632
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:36,932
 cut that extra swagger.

633
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,768
 Be relaxed and easy... confident.

634
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,704
 Let me show how...
 Hi, l'm Sanjay ... Sanjay Singhania.

635
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:45,705
 Stop. Don't teach me acting.
 l belong in theatre, l've done four plays.

636
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:51,144
 l was putting out a first class act,
 then he walked in and things went awry.

637
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:54,015
 Hey... take offthat coat.

638
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:57,016
 Take it off, get out ofthat coat!
 - l have a shoot tomorrow. lt's my only coat.

639
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,720
 l just canceled your shoot. You're good only
 for rubber slippers, snap out of it!

640
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,360
 Who, me...?
 - Wear it.

641
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:16,803
 Oh yes!
 You are... looking smart.

642
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:21,074
 Put on the goggles.

643
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:26,381
 Oh wow!

644
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:28,984
 Perfect!

645
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,019
 Perfect!

646
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:34,020
 Sachin! Come for tonight's party.
 Be Sanjay.

647
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:37,325
 Please?

648
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,594
 Please say yes!

649
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:42,130
 Please!

650
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:44,032
 Please say yes...?

651
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:45,000
 Okay.

652
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:45,667
 Yes!

653
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,668
 Welcome to our chief guest,
 Mr Sanjay Singhania

654
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:58,747
 Oh hi...
 - Hello.

655
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:01,748
 Having a nice time?
 - Yes, thank you.

656
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:06,454
 Kalpana

657
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:09,455
 Did you invite him properly?
 - Yes, sir!

658
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,692
 lf he turns up for real,
 everyone'll go mad.

659
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:18,033
 lf he doesn't turn up,

660
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:21,034
 then l'll go mad.

661
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:24,504
 Madam...

662
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:29,409
 The coat is ready. Just give me the go
 and l'll give you a grand entry.

663
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,380
 l've rehearsed it thoroughly.

664
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,051
 l'm Sanjay Singhania...
 oh hello Sanjay.

665
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,222
 Get out of my face.

666
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:44,223
 You fool!

667
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:47,429
 Hi Kalpana...
 - Hi!

668
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:50,430
 Mr Singhania has arrived.

669
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:07,847
 Who told him to get a car like that?
 l'm not footing this bill.

670
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:12,618
 Oh... thank you.

671
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:14,756
 How wonderful!

672
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:17,757
 He hasn't begun acting and all these fools have
 already taken him for Sanjay Singhania?

673
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,298
 Oh yes, yes...

674
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:25,100
 Will you hold this, please?

675
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,368
 Hi darling!

676
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:29,904
 Sorry, l'm late... my God!
 You're looking gorgeous... come.

677
01:08:29,905 --> 01:08:32,905
 Welcome to this party.
 - Thank you.

678
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:35,276
 Hello... hello...

679
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,479
 Hello sir!

680
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,146
 Sorry.

681
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:39,647
 Welcome, sir.
 - Thank you.

682
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:42,648
 Myself, Satveer Kohli. l'm Kalpana's director
 and l run this ad film company.

683
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:47,487
 Hello sir, how are you?
 - Thank you sir, l'm very good.

684
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:50,690
 l happen to be the one who insisted that
 Kalpana must say yes to you.

685
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,561
 l see...?

686
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:56,562
 You never told him !
 - Of course l told him...

687
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:59,134
 l told you...?
 - Oh... yes...

688
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,803
 Autograph, please?

689
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,804
 l read your article in Economic Times.
 l fully agree with your policy suggestions.

690
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:08,875
 Please leave him alone...
 don't disturb him.

691
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:12,645
 Please come, dinner is ready.

692
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:22,155
 That was too close an embrace.

693
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:25,558
 And that was a kiss in public.

694
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:29,397
 l've done a hundred ads.

695
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:32,367
 Ninety in groups. Ten, solo.

696
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:35,368
 You learn how to respect your seniors or,
 you're getting nowhere in life.

697
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:44,445
 l don't believe this.

698
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:45,380
 What?

699
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:46,848
 l just can't believe...

700
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,850
 Why not...?

701
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:51,851
 Can't believe that l'm sitting
 in such august presence...

702
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,189
 Still, he's right amongst us.

703
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:02,128
 Excuse me...

704
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,366
 Some ice, please?

705
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:08,367
 So much cold is good enough for you.

706
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:11,639
 Over-acting. He'll get caught.

707
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,640
 Please get lost.

708
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:18,880
 Excuse me...

709
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,716
 We're from the Dinanath Charitable Trust.

710

745
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:20,726
 who wins her love.

746
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:24,663
 So l haven't told her the truth about me.

747
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:29,635
 lf she accepts me,

748
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:33,406
 then l'll confess to being Sanjay Singhania.

749
01:13:35,344 --> 01:13:38,344
 lf she refuses,

750
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:39,414
 then l remain Sachin...

751
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:42,415
 and l fade out of her life.

752
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:48,254

894
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:07,579
 He wasn't anyone ofthem.

895
01:33:09,684 --> 01:33:12,684
 These men were afraid of me.

896
01:33:13,654 --> 01:33:16,654
 But this is someone else...

897
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:20,625
 someone l'm missing.

898
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:23,330
 A girl is here, asking for you.

899
01:33:23,331 --> 01:33:24,331
 What girl?

900
01:33:24,332 --> 01:33:27,332
 My name is Sunita.
 l am a medical student.

901
01:33:28,569 --> 01:33:31,569
 l visited a patient
 at his home, recently.

902
01:33:31,806 --> 01:33:34,806
 He is planning to kill you.

903
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:39,110
 He has already killed two others.
 l have seen photos ofthe dead men.

904
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:44,949
 He is an extremely dangerous man.
 l saw him trying to kill a policeman.

905
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:49,320
 The policeman got killed in an accident.
 After that he came after me, to kill me.

906
01:33:54,161 --> 01:33:56,730
 Look... your photo.

907
01:33:56,731 --> 01:33:59,731
 A date is inscribed underneath.

908
01:34:00,267 --> 01:34:03,267
 l was about to go to the police.
 But if my college gets to know, l'm in a mess.

909
01:34:06,774 --> 01:34:09,609
 l just couldn't sit on it,
 so l came to you.

910
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:12,512
 To warn you.

911
01:34:12,513 --> 01:34:15,513
 His photo...
 the man who wants to kill you.

912
01:34:21,956 --> 01:34:24,956
 Mr Sanjay Singhania. 31 years.
 Short term memory loss

913
01:34:46,013 --> 01:34:49,013
 Short term memory loss.

914
01:34:51,152 --> 01:34:54,152
 A man who forgets everything in
 fifteen minutes is planning to kill me.

915
01:34:58,993 --> 01:35:01,993
 He even named a day for my death?

916
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:06,330
 l got to fix a time for him to die.

917
01:35:07,068 --> 01:35:10,068
 12 hours. This man will be
 on earth no more.

918
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:44,738
 The boss?

919
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:46,406
 Watch out.

920
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:47,907
 He's away from home.

921
01:35:47,908 --> 01:35:50,908
 lf he goes your way, you kill him.
 lf he comes this way, l'll kill the bastard.

922
01:35:52,513 --> 01:35:55,513
 Sure.

923
01:36:53,741 --> 01:36:56,142
 l'm into this problem...

924
01:36:56,143 --> 01:36:57,043
 What...?

925
01:36:57,044 --> 01:36:58,812
 He has my photo.

926
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:01,481
 Who has...?
 - That Sanjay Singhania... he has it.

927
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:03,149
 lsn't it the one ?

928
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:05,852
 He has another one.
 He had taken two photos.

929
01:37:05,853 --> 01:37:07,954
 You're the problem.

930
01:37:07,955 --> 01:37:10,955
 lf it ends up with the police,
 l'm in a fix.

931
01:37:11,759 --> 01:37:14,759
 Ask Mr Ghajini. He's looking for that guy,
 he'll get the photo for you.

932
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:37,849
 Hello, Mr Ghajini...?

933
01:37:38,385 --> 01:37:41,385
 Hello...

934
01:37:43,624 --> 01:37:46,192
 Mr Ghajini...?

935
01:37:46,193 --> 01:37:47,193
 Yes

936
01:37:47,194 --> 01:37:49,362
 l'm Sunita...

937
01:37:49,363 --> 01:37:52,363
 l met you about Sanjay Singhania.

938
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:55,702
 Who...?

939
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:57,370
 Sanjay Singhania,

940
01:37:57,371 --> 01:37:59,639
 the man who wants to kill you.

941
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:02,640
 The one with the 15-minute memory...

942
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:05,877
 He has a problem remembering,
 but best to be cautious.

943
01:38:07,615 --> 01:38:10,350
 He's an extremely dangerous man.

944
01:38:10,351 --> 01:38:13,351
 You see, he has a photo of mine.

945
01:38:16,223 --> 01:38:18,124
 Do what you will to him,

946
01:38:18,125 --> 01:38:21,125
 but get me my photo, please.

947
01:38:21,295 --> 01:38:24,295
 He took my photo in the college canteen.

948
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:31,237
 What are you wearing in the photo ?

949
01:38:31,238 --> 01:38:34,238
 Blue top and blue jeans.

950
01:38:37,044 --> 01:38:39,913
 Let me find it, l'll send it to you.

951
01:38:39,914 --> 01:38:42,914
 What's your address ?

952
01:40:24,485 --> 01:40:25,818
 Warden...!

953
01:40:25,819 --> 01:40:26,786
 Hurry...

954
01:40:26,787 --> 01:40:29,787
 Help me, please! Help me!

955
01:40:40,768 --> 01:40:41,868
 Excuse me.

956
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:42,835
 Stay away.

957
01:40:42,836 --> 01:40:43,903
 Where's the lift?

958
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:45,304
 Between second and third floors.

959
01:40:45,305 --> 01:40:48,305
 Put on the main switch.

960
01:42:03,383 --> 01:42:06,383
 His diaries.

961
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:49,260
 lf she accepts me,

962
01:42:49,296 --> 01:42:52,296
 then l'll confess to being Sanjay Singhania.

963
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:55,001
 lf she refuses,

964
01:42:55,002 --> 01:42:57,270
 then l remain Sachin...

965
01:42:57,271 --> 01:42:59,605
 and l fade out of her life.

966
01:42:59,606 --> 01:43:02,606
 All l await now, is tomorrow.

967
01:43:30,337 --> 01:43:33,337
 This wait for a yes will keep me up tonight.

968
01:43:34,908 --> 01:43:37,577
 This suspense is haunting,

969
01:43:37,578 --> 01:43:39,912
 how can l sleep tonight?

970
01:43:39,913 --> 01:43:42,913
 To what news my morning light will dawn,

971
01:43:44,585 --> 01:43:46,919
 to melodies of love like rain?

972
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:49,920
 Or, is this thirst to go unquenched?

973
01:44:11,945 --> 01:44:14,945
 Like a passion, unfulfilled

974
01:44:15,115 --> 01:44:17,783
 You hold me in an ecstasy, thrilled

975
01:44:17,784 --> 01:44:20,784
 And now,

976
01:44:26,293 --> 01:44:27,960
 the consummation,

977
01:44:27,961 --> 01:44:29,362
 ofthat ecstasy,

978
01:44:29,363 --> 01:44:31,631
 in your arms ,

979
01:44:31,632 --> 01:44:34,632
 is all l wish from you

980
01:44:34,968 --> 01:44:37,803
 ln my heart of hearts, how l pine

981
01:44:37,804 --> 01:44:40,804
 To splash you with my colours of life

982
01:44:40,807 --> 01:44:43,142
 ln every mood, to match my rhythm

983
01:44:43,143 --> 01:44:46,143
 lt's all l wish from you

984
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:49,148
 lf only you say yes, then life...

985
01:44:49,149 --> 01:44:52,149
 can spring forth from the fountainhead...

986
01:44:52,152 --> 01:44:55,152
 to spew my pearls of life upon your path

987
01:45:01,261 --> 01:45:02,995
 Consummation...

988
01:45:02,996 --> 01:45:04,397
 ofthat ecstasy...

989
01:45:04,398 --> 01:45:05,998
 in your arms...

990
01:45:05,999 --> 01:45:08,999
 is all l wish

991
01:45:43,036 --> 01:45:45,705
 My gossamer dreams are cast in glass

992
01:45:45,706 --> 01:45:48,541
 As l ford my nights in dark

993
01:45:48,542 --> 01:45:51,542
 Fearful, lest my fantasies shatter

994
01:45:54,214 --> 01:45:57,049
 My hopes are inflamed

995
01:45:57,050 --> 01:45:59,885
 Yet l fear, lest some tempest...

996
01:45:59,886 --> 01:46:02,886
 puts out my flame

997
01:46:05,225 --> 01:46:08,225
 l wait for a lone yes

998
01:46:10,897 --> 01:46:13,897
 To turn on the springs ofjoy...

999
01:46:16,236 --> 01:46:19,236
 in a culmination...

1000
01:46:19,606 --> 01:46:22,241
 of my dreams...

1001
01:46:22,242 --> 01:46:25,242
 in the ecstasy ofyour embrace

1002
01:46:27,481 --> 01:46:30,481
 lt's all l wish

1003
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:56,440
 l have my Moon, over me my skies

1004
01:46:56,510 --> 01:46:59,278
 Where dense dark clouds also hover

1005
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:02,279
 l wish this Moon is never overcast

1006
01:47:04,518 --> 01:47:07,518
 A searing loneliness,

1007
01:47:07,621 --> 01:47:10,621
 a pacing heart,

1008
01:47:10,624 --> 01:47:13,624
 and not a moment's peace...

1009
01:47:15,962 --> 01:47:18,962
 make up a wonderful story of mine;

1010
01:47:21,535 --> 01:47:24,535
 l've only a restless yearning...

1011
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:29,975
 for a passion unfulfilled,

1012
01:47:29,976 --> 01:47:32,976
 for an ecstasy, the thrill...

1013
01:47:32,979 --> 01:47:35,979
 ofyour embrace

1014
01:47:38,151 --> 01:47:41,151
 lt's all l wish from you

1015
01:47:41,321 --> 01:47:44,321
 ln my heart of hearts, how l pine

1016
01:47:44,324 --> 01:47:47,159
 To splash you with my colours of life

1017
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,662
 ln every mood, to match my rhythm

1018
01:47:49,663 --> 01:47:52,663
 lt's all l wish from you

1019
01:47:52,833 --> 01:47:55,833
 lf only you say yes, then life...

1020
01:47:55,836 --> 01:47:58,671
 can spring forth from the fountainhead...

1021
01:47:58,672 --> 01:48:01,672
 to spew my pearls of life upon your path

1022
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:07,010
 For you, l thirst

1023
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:56,360
 All night, l kept thinking.

1024
01:48:56,396 --> 01:48:59,396
 Until one o'clock it was, why you?

1025
01:49:00,333 --> 01:49:03,333
 By two o'clock, it was why not?

1026
01:49:04,104 --> 01:49:05,738
 At three am,

1027
01:49:05,739 --> 01:49:08,607
 am l rushing into this?

1028
01:49:08,608 --> 01:49:11,608
 At four, if not now then how will l ever...?

1029
01:49:12,245 --> 01:49:15,245
 By the time it got to five o'c lock,
 l had decided.

1030
01:49:16,483 --> 01:49:19,483
 l do.

1031
01:49:25,125 --> 01:49:28,125
 l love you.

1032
01:49:54,754 --> 01:49:56,855
 Now's my turn to tell her who l am.

1033
01:49:56,856 --> 01:49:59,825
 But you don't know who l am.

1034
01:49:59,826 --> 01:50:02,826
 What...!
 - When you get to know about my dad...

1035
01:50:03,763 --> 01:50:05,831
 it'll blow your brains.

1036
01:50:05,832 --> 01:50:08,832
 ls she talking my lines?

1037
01:50:09,769 --> 01:50:11,203
 Take this.

1038
01:50:11,204 --> 01:50:14,204
 ln 1992, my dad had three Ambassador cars.

1039
01:50:17,811 --> 01:50:19,545
 Oh wow...
 - Oh yes.

1040
01:50:19,546 --> 01:50:22,214
 He had a travel agency.
 Shetty Travels.

1041
01:50:22,215 --> 01:50:25,215
 Shitty Travels?
 - Hey! Shetty... Travels.

1042
01:50:25,352 --> 01:50:28,352
 Yes... l see... Shetty Travels.
 - So.

1043
01:50:29,556 --> 01:50:31,757
 lt was my uncle who cheated him.

1044
01:50:31,758 --> 01:50:33,192
 Ohh...

1045
01:50:33,193 --> 01:50:35,861
 He stole all three cars.

1046
01:50:35,862 --> 01:50:38,697
 Brokenhearted, my dad died.

1047
01:50:38,698 --> 01:50:40,699
 That day, l swore...

1048
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:43,700
 until l buy three Ambassador cars,

1049
01:50:43,803 --> 01:50:46,772
 l won't marry.

1050
01:50:46,773 --> 01:50:48,907
 Three...?

1051
01:50:48,908 --> 01:50:51,243
 Can't it climb down by a couple or so?

1052
01:50:51,244 --> 01:50:53,379
 No way.

1053
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:56,380
 lfyou can wait, then wait.

1054
01:50:56,716 --> 01:50:57,650
 Otherwise,

1055
01:50:57,651 --> 01:51:00,651
 marry a girl ofyour class.

1056
01:51:02,622 --> 01:51:04,456
 l'll wait.

1057
01:51:04,457 --> 01:51:07,457
 Don't worry.
 Even after l'm rich,

1058
01:51:07,761 --> 01:51:10,761
 l'll still be the same to you, like l'm now.

1059
01:51:11,865 --> 01:51:14,865
 Promise?
 - Promise.

1060
01:51:24,744 --> 01:51:25,911
 Good morning, sir.
 - Good morning.

1061
01:51:25,912 --> 01:51:28,147
 A very happy new year to you.
 - Thank you.

1062
01:51:28,148 --> 01:51:30,582
 Mr Goenka has canceled for the day.

1063
01:51:30,583 --> 01:51:33,318
 The board meeting is at eleven thirty.

1064
01:51:33,319 --> 01:51:35,821
 The marketing presentation is post-lunch.

1065
01:51:35,822 --> 01:51:38,822
 Okay.

1066
01:51:41,628 --> 01:51:44,628
 Sir... what did she say when
 she got to know about you?

1067
01:51:48,201 --> 01:51:50,836
 l haven't told her.

1068
01:51:50,837 --> 01:51:53,672
 Why, sir?

1069
01:51:53,673 --> 01:51:54,840
 Because, in 1992...

1070
01:51:54,841 --> 01:51:57,576
 her dad had three Ambassador cars.

1071
01:51:57,577 --> 01:52:00,577
 Her uncle tricked her dad out ofthe cars.

1072
01:52:01,648 --> 01:52:04,648
 Now she wants to be richer than her uncle.

1073
01:52:05,218 --> 01:52:06,452
 Until then, she won't marry.

1074
01:52:06,453 --> 01:52:08,454
 What ifyou just told her...?

1075
01:52:08,455 --> 01:52:11,256
 She'd want to be richer than me...

1076
01:52:11,257 --> 01:52:14,257
 that'd be the end of my wedding.

1077
01:52:14,894 --> 01:52:17,894
 Truth is, l prefer to keep up this facade.

1078
01:52:27,273 --> 01:52:30,273
 l had bought this flat...
 as my gift to her...

1079
01:52:30,276 --> 01:52:33,276
 after telling her about me.
 lt's not to be,

1080
01:52:35,882 --> 01:52:38,283
 but l got to give her the flat, somehow.

1081
01:52:38,284 --> 01:52:40,953
 That's your responsibility.

1082
01:52:40,954 --> 01:52:42,654
 lt'll be done, sir.

1083
01:52:42,655 --> 01:52:45,655
 Thanks.

1084
01:52:57,303 --> 01:52:58,771
 May no one ever wish you ill.

1085
01:52:58,772 --> 01:53:01,772
 And your tank forever be petrol-ful.

1086
01:53:14,854 --> 01:53:17,756
 For me too... please.
 - Quiet ! There's enough for everyone.

1087
01:53:17,757 --> 01:53:20,526
 For me, too?
 - Late, even today?

1088
01:53:20,527 --> 01:53:22,227
 You bought it?

1089
01:53:22,228 --> 01:53:24,196
 Yes... surprise.

1090
01:53:24,197 --> 01:53:27,197
 One in. Two more to go.
 - Great!

1091
01:53:27,667 --> 01:53:30,435
 l sold the jewellery meant
 for my wedding.

1092
01:53:30,436 --> 01:53:32,137
 Dear husband to-be,

1093
01:53:32,138 --> 01:53:33,806
 l don't think, you care for a dowry.

1094
01:53:33,807 --> 01:53:35,541
 So, l bought a car.

1095
01:53:35,542 --> 01:53:38,542
 Sure... it moves?

1096
01:53:38,711 --> 01:53:41,711
 Are you joking?
 Take a test drive.

1097
01:53:42,549 --> 01:53:45,549
 Come on, kids.

1098
01:53:50,623 --> 01:53:52,157
 Smooth drive, isn't it?

1099
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:53,091
 Smooth roads.

1100
01:53:53,092 --> 01:53:55,494
 Hey...?

1101
01:53:55,495 --> 01:53:58,430
 Smooth as butter.

1102
01:53:58,431 --> 01:54:01,431
 The radio, there's one in there.
 lt works!

1103
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:24,120
 Hey, this car is mine!
 l just bought it.

1104
01:54:24,858 --> 01:54:27,858
 Nice, isn't it?
 - What a pretty car!

1105
01:54:50,283 --> 01:54:51,350
 Good news, sir.

1106
01:54:51,351 --> 01:54:52,784
 The fax is in from London.

1107
01:54:52,785 --> 01:54:54,119
 We've got the licence.

1108
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:56,788
 All calls to UK will be routed through us.

1109
01:54:56,789 --> 01:54:58,123
 That's wonderful!

1110
01:54:58,124 --> 01:54:59,458
 Give the good news to the staff.

1111
01:54:59,459 --> 01:55:01,360
 Sure. You must go to
 London immediately.

1112
01:55:01,361 --> 01:55:04,361
 Yes

1113
01:55:06,566 --> 01:55:07,766
 Hi, how are you?

1114
01:55:07,767 --> 01:55:10,369
 There's good news!

1115
01:55:10,370 --> 01:55:11,670
 Strange!

1116
01:55:11,671 --> 01:55:14,671
 She always pips me to the talking post?

1117
01:55:16,409 --> 01:55:17,709
 Even l have something to tell you.

1118
01:55:17,710 --> 01:55:20,710
 No. Me first.

1119
01:55:20,914 --> 01:55:21,880
 Tell me.

1120
01:55:21,881 --> 01:55:24,881
 l won a brand new flat in
 an Air Voice lucky contest.

1121
01:55:26,653 --> 01:55:29,653
 Air Voice lucky contest...?

1122
01:55:30,356 --> 01:55:33,356
 Sir... that flat you wanted to give her...
 l fixed a contest to do it.

1123
01:55:34,794 --> 01:55:37,029
 Wow, that's great! Congratulations.

1124
01:55:37,030 --> 01:55:39,031
 Notjust congratulations.

1125
01:55:39,032 --> 01:55:41,233
 Get over here in five minutes.

1126
01:55:41,234 --> 01:55:43,802
 Kalpana, l'm a bit busy.
 l can't come.

1127
01:55:43,803 --> 01:55:46,803
 l'll hit you for pretending to be busy.

1128
01:55:46,873 --> 01:55:49,873
 l'm giving you the address.
 Come right away.

1129
01:56:00,887 --> 01:56:01,954
 Hi!

1130
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:04,356
 Hi... congratulations.

1131
01:56:04,357 --> 01:56:07,025
 Thank you

1132
01:56:07,026 --> 01:56:10,026
 One second!

1133
01:56:12,465 --> 01:56:15,465
 What's this?

1134
01:56:17,136 --> 01:56:18,904
 You're taking your first step
 into this home.

1135
01:56:18,905 --> 01:56:21,905
 l want to capture it for posterity.

1136
01:56:25,712 --> 01:56:28,712
 You too, come over.

1137
01:57:21,901 --> 01:57:23,935
 Nice, isn't it?

1138
01:57:23,936 --> 01:57:24,836
 Beautiful.

1139
01:57:24,837 --> 01:57:26,438
 This is how it'll stay forever,

1140
01:57:26,439 --> 01:57:29,439
 to remind us ofthe first step we took.

1141
01:57:40,219 --> 01:57:43,219
 So! How is this home?

1142
01:57:43,756 --> 01:57:45,757
 Fabulous!

1143
01:57:45,758 --> 01:57:48,627
 New home, second hand car...

1144
01:57:48,628 --> 01:57:50,829
 lucky strike?

1145
01:57:50,830 --> 01:57:52,631
 l'm feeling so happy!

1146
01:57:52,632 --> 01:57:55,133
 Weren't you saying something
 on the phone?

1147
01:57:55,134 --> 01:57:58,134
 Yes... l got to go out oftown
 for ten days.

1148
01:58:01,808 --> 01:58:04,142
 Where to...?

1149
01:58:04,143 --> 01:58:06,812
 My village.

1150
01:58:06,813 --> 01:58:09,813
 Why, so suddenly?

1151
01:58:11,017 --> 01:58:14,017
 My mother is sick.

1152
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:16,588
 Then, bring her here.

1153
01:58:16,589 --> 01:58:19,589
 l got to go, l have some property there...

1154
01:58:19,725 --> 01:58:21,326
 two acres of land.

1155
01:58:21,327 --> 01:58:22,494
 l got to sell it...

1156
01:58:22,495 --> 01:58:25,495
 for my mother's medical treatment.

1157
01:58:26,232 --> 01:58:29,232
 Ten days?
 You'll come sooner, ifyou can...?

1158
01:58:32,205 --> 01:58:34,573
 l will.

1159
01:58:34,574 --> 01:58:37,075
 You will come, won't you?

1160
01:58:37,076 --> 01:58:39,744
 What's it, why are you nervous?

1161
01:58:39,745 --> 01:58:42,745
 l don't know, it's just an odd feeling.

1162
01:58:43,583 --> 01:58:46,583
 Hey...

1163
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:50,620
 Silly you.

1164
01:58:54,327 --> 01:58:55,994
 All the rest are standard clauses.

1165
01:58:55,995 --> 01:58:57,929
 l think we've covered everything, right?

1166
01:58:57,930 --> 01:59:00,699
 Yes, we've clarified all the points.

1167
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:03,700
 l'll need a hard copy on the flight.

1168
01:59:04,203 --> 01:59:04,870
 Will be done.

1169
01:59:04,871 --> 01:59:07,439
 Make sure, all changes are incorporated.
 - Right.

1170
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:10,275
 Yes...?
 - Sir, we're getting late.

1171
01:59:10,276 --> 01:59:13,276
 lt's one o'clock!
 All right, let's pack.

1172
01:59:15,014 --> 01:59:18,014
 Thank you, gentlemen.

1173
01:59:22,722 --> 01:59:23,588
 Hello?

1174
01:59:23,589 --> 01:59:26,589
 Hello Sachin... Kalpana.
 - Yes Kalpana ?

1175
01:59:26,592 --> 01:59:28,693
 l got to see you right away.

1176
01:59:28,694 --> 01:59:31,694
 Come over to my old place.

1177
01:59:31,831 --> 01:59:34,831
 lt's one am. Say, what's the matter?

1178
01:59:35,268 --> 01:59:38,268
 l got to see you before you leave.
 Please.

1179
01:59:41,874 --> 01:59:44,874
 All right. l'm coming.

1180
01:59:57,690 --> 01:59:59,291
 Why are you standing on the street?

1181
01:59:59,292 --> 02:00:02,292
 Just waiting, for you.

1182
02:00:07,333 --> 02:00:10,333
 So... why did you call me?

1183
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:22,414
 What's this ?

1184
02:00:22,415 --> 02:00:24,816
 One hundred and thirty five thousand.

1185
02:00:24,817 --> 02:00:27,817
 For your mother's treatment.

1186
02:00:29,188 --> 02:00:31,489
 Where did you get so much money?

1187
02:00:31,490 --> 02:00:32,757
 l sold my car.

1188
02:00:32,758 --> 02:00:35,758
 What... why?

1189
02:00:36,329 --> 02:00:39,329
 You would've sold the land.

1190
02:00:39,799 --> 02:00:42,799
 Don't sell it. lt's an inheritance.

1191
02:00:43,603 --> 02:00:46,603
 A car... l can buy again.

1192
02:00:48,274 --> 02:00:51,274
 But...

1193
02:00:51,410 --> 02:00:53,111
 you wanted the car so much!

1194
02:00:53,112 --> 02:00:53,945
 Forget it.

1195
02:00:53,946 --> 02:00:56,848
 Show your mother my soap ad.

1196
02:00:56,849 --> 02:00:59,849
 l'm looking nice in that one.

1197
02:01:04,123 --> 02:01:07,123
 Come back quickly.

1198
02:01:07,126 --> 02:01:10,126
 Next week, l'm in Goa for an ad shoot.

1199
02:01:10,396 --> 02:01:12,530
 l'll be back in two or three days.

1200
02:01:12,531 --> 02:01:15,531
 You're getting late... now go.

1201
02:01:19,805 --> 02:01:22,805
 Go on.

1202
02:01:33,052 --> 02:01:36,052


1203
02:02:18,297 --> 02:02:21,297
 How was it that you came to me

1204
02:02:24,136 --> 02:02:27,136
 How blessed l am,
 but it's hard to believe

1205
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:31,140
 You descended upon
 life's placid lake...

1206
02:02:32,144 --> 02:02:35,144
 like a rare Moon,

1207
02:02:38,084 --> 02:02:40,919
 slowly,

1208
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:43,920
 gently

1209
02:02:46,592 --> 02:02:49,592
 Under a winter's Sun,

1210
02:02:50,429 --> 02:02:53,429
 like a warm melody...

1211
02:02:53,833 --> 02:02:56,833
 you have caressed me,

1212
02:02:56,869 --> 02:02:59,869
 l am enthralled

1213
02:03:05,244 --> 02:03:08,244
 ln you, my peace.
 You are my passion

1214
02:03:11,450 --> 02:03:14,450
 Why didn't l find you before?

1215
02:03:17,323 --> 02:03:20,323
 How was it that you came to me...
 how blessed l am, but it's hard to believe

1216
02:03:29,034 --> 02:03:31,136
 That day, l swore...

1217
02:03:31,137 --> 02:03:34,137
 until l buy three Ambassador cars,

1218
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:37,140
 l won't marry.

1219
02:03:38,711 --> 02:03:41,711
 Don't sell it.
 lt's an inheritance.

1220
02:03:42,481 --> 02:03:45,481
 A car... l can buy again.

1221
02:03:50,990 --> 02:03:53,990
 And once l believed,

1222
02:03:58,330 --> 02:04:01,166
 that the Creator finds...

1223
02:04:01,167 --> 02:04:04,167
 His urge no more

1224
02:04:04,170 --> 02:04:04,836
 And then...

1225
02:04:04,837 --> 02:04:07,837
 He created you

1226
02:04:10,109 --> 02:04:13,109
 And now He is revealed to me...

1227
02:04:16,515 --> 02:04:19,515
 in all His glory

1228
02:04:33,032 --> 02:04:36,032
 Chords of a music touch my life,

1229
02:04:38,871 --> 02:04:41,871
 l can feel new tunes coming into life

1230
02:04:43,042 --> 02:04:46,042
 But l still can't believe...

1231
02:04:52,952 --> 02:04:55,553
 how blessed l am,

1232
02:04:55,554 --> 02:04:58,554
 how you came to me...

1233
02:05:20,312 --> 02:05:23,312
 l love you.

1234
02:05:30,689 --> 02:05:33,689
 Come back quickly.

1235
02:06:05,991 --> 02:06:08,991
 That's upto 21st June 2006.

1236
02:06:09,728 --> 02:06:12,728
 Afterwards, Sanjay went to London
 and Kalpana went to Goa.

1237
02:06:13,699 --> 02:06:16,699
 What happened after that?

1238
02:06:35,888 --> 02:06:38,888
 Anything more on the man
 we arrested at the girls' hostel?

1239
02:06:40,793 --> 02:06:43,793
 No, it's turning out to be a strange case.
 - How come?

1240
02:06:46,599 --> 02:06:48,066
 Bring him.

1241
02:06:48,067 --> 02:06:51,067
 lt was tough keeping him under control,
 so he was given a sedative.

1242
02:06:57,343 --> 02:07:00,343
 He has several names
 and numbers tattooed.

1243
02:07:00,512 --> 02:07:03,512
 Also, several strange remarks.

1244
02:07:03,582 --> 02:07:04,616
 On the head...

1245
02:07:04,617 --> 02:07:06,084
 he has a deep scar.

1246
02:07:06,085 --> 02:07:07,018
 Found on him...

1247
02:07:07,019 --> 02:07:10,019
 a gun, a camera, photographs.

1248
02:07:10,456 --> 02:07:13,456
 We haven't been able to
 find out who he is.

1249
02:07:15,794 --> 02:07:18,794
 Call up those numbers.
 Find out who they are.

1250
02:07:34,747 --> 02:07:36,614
 Hello?

1251
02:07:36,615 --> 02:07:39,615
 Constable Dhuri from
 D.N.Nagar Police station.

1252
02:07:56,869 --> 02:07:59,869
 Do you recognise this man?

1253
02:08:07,179 --> 02:08:08,379
 Yes.

1254
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:11,149
 He is Sanjay Singhania,
 chairman ofAir Voice.

1255
02:08:11,150 --> 02:08:14,150
 The chairman ofAir Voice?
 - Yes.

1256
02:08:14,486 --> 02:08:16,754
 He suffers from short term memory loss,

1257
02:08:16,755 --> 02:08:19,755
 doesn't remember anything
 beyond 15 minutes.

1258
02:08:21,060 --> 02:08:23,061
 A friend of mine,

1259
02:08:23,062 --> 02:08:26,062
 he has tattooed in my name and
 number, for remembering me.

1260
02:08:30,436 --> 02:08:32,303
 That's all.

1261
02:08:32,304 --> 02:08:33,738
 Where did you find him?

1262
02:08:33,739 --> 02:08:36,739
 Medical college girl's hostel. ln a lift.

1263
02:08:37,676 --> 02:08:40,411
 Sir, his manager and
 his secretary are here.

1264
02:08:40,412 --> 02:08:43,412
 Have you written a complaint about him?
 - Not yet, sir.

1265
02:08:44,416 --> 02:08:45,683
 Wait a while.

1266
02:08:45,684 --> 02:08:47,652
 He's only a patient.

1267
02:08:47,653 --> 02:08:49,854
 And do you know who he is?

1268
02:08:49,855 --> 02:08:52,190
 He was found in a girls' hostel
 with a gun.

1269
02:08:52,191 --> 02:08:53,991
 How is one to take him
 for a medical patient?

1270
02:08:53,992 --> 02:08:56,992
 The gun is for his safety.

1271
02:08:57,029 --> 02:08:59,697
 Here's the gun licence.

1272
02:08:59,698 --> 02:09:02,698
 He didn't shoot at anyone, did he?

1273
02:09:03,168 --> 02:09:05,036
 No complaint has been registered.

1274
02:09:05,037 --> 02:09:06,938
 You can take him away.

1275
02:09:06,939 --> 02:09:09,607
 But from now on, be careful.

1276
02:09:09,608 --> 02:09:12,343
 Please take their contact details.

1277
02:09:12,344 --> 02:09:14,245
 Thank you.
 - Thank you very much.

1278
02:09:14,246 --> 02:09:17,246
 Careful.

1279
02:09:52,751 --> 02:09:54,318
 Sorry, you aren't allowed...
 - Who are you?

1280
02:09:54,319 --> 02:09:56,554
 Move over.
 - Whom do you want?

1281
02:09:56,555 --> 02:09:57,822
 Silence!

1282
02:09:57,823 --> 02:10:00,823
 Why are you locking us?

1283
02:10:02,561 --> 02:10:05,561
 171 , Cheetah Camp. Deonar

1284
02:10:07,733 --> 02:10:10,733
 13.06.2008

1285
02:10:10,836 --> 02:10:11,969
 Whose address is it?

1286
02:10:11,970 --> 02:10:13,838
 Mine.

1287
02:10:13,839 --> 02:10:16,839
 The date is tomorrow's.
 One day on, you'd be gone.

1288
02:10:19,077 --> 02:10:22,077
 Don't shoot him!

1289
02:10:22,247 --> 02:10:25,247
 My name and number are on his body.

1290
02:10:26,585 --> 02:10:29,120
 ln police records,
 he's a friend of mine.

1291
02:10:29,121 --> 02:10:32,121
 A murder enquiry can
 become big trouble.

1292
02:10:33,559 --> 02:10:36,559
 You mean, we leave him alive?
 - Yes, alive.

1293
02:10:38,130 --> 02:10:40,364
 But like the living dead.

1294
02:10:40,365 --> 02:10:43,365
 He's got memory tags everywhere.

1295
02:10:44,536 --> 02:10:47,536
 We've got to erase what he has written,

1296
02:10:48,207 --> 02:10:51,207
 we got to turn him into blank paper.

1297
02:12:00,279 --> 02:12:03,279
 Now, he's just like any other furniture

1298
02:12:05,017 --> 02:12:08,017
 Just like a vegetable.

1299
02:12:22,935 --> 02:12:25,935
 Newspaper archives?
 - First floor.

1300
02:14:08,807 --> 02:14:10,908
 Why are you hiding?

1301
02:14:10,909 --> 02:14:12,977
 Come out.

1302
02:14:12,978 --> 02:14:15,978
 Come... careful.

1303
02:14:17,749 --> 02:14:20,251
 Sit.

1304
02:14:20,252 --> 02:14:22,019
 What happened to you?

1305
02:14:22,020 --> 02:14:24,922
 l'm from Latur village.

1306
02:14:24,923 --> 02:14:27,923
 Ramesh brought me to Mumbai,
 saying he'd find a job for me.

1307
02:14:30,595 --> 02:14:33,595
 But he sold me to someone.

1308
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:38,600
 Now... he's forcing me to go to Goa.

1309
02:14:41,773 --> 02:14:44,773
 And... there are more girls like me
 in a bogey up ahead.

1310
02:14:46,778 --> 02:14:49,778
 At one ofthe stations, l managed to
 get away and l'm hiding here.

1311
02:14:52,117 --> 02:14:55,117
 Don't cry. Nothing is going to happen.
 l'm here with you.

1312
02:15:00,892 --> 02:15:02,093
 She must be around.

1313
02:15:02,094 --> 02:15:04,028
 Hurry up.

1314
02:15:04,029 --> 02:15:06,564
 Move in.

1315
02:15:06,565 --> 02:15:09,565
 Look behind.

1316
02:15:12,737 --> 02:15:15,737
 Did you see a girl, wearing a frock?

1317
02:15:16,141 --> 02:15:18,809
 Give me ten Rupees.

1318
02:15:18,810 --> 02:15:21,810
 Here.

1319
02:15:23,982 --> 02:15:26,982
 Open the door.
 - Open up!

1320
02:15:27,986 --> 02:15:29,820
 Give that girl to me!

1321
02:15:29,821 --> 02:15:31,689
 l paid 2000 Rupees to buy her!

1322
02:15:31,690 --> 02:15:33,257
 Come on, open up!

1323
02:15:33,258 --> 02:15:36,258
 Open the door!

1324
02:15:39,164 --> 02:15:42,164
 Open it!

1325
02:15:45,437 --> 02:15:47,171
 lt's gold!

1326
02:15:47,172 --> 02:15:49,473
 Should be worth 3,000.

1327
02:15:49,474 --> 02:15:52,474
 Forget the girl. Let's go.

1328
02:15:53,545 --> 02:15:56,545
 lt's all right.

1329
02:16:19,070 --> 02:16:20,204
 Don't be afraid.

1330
02:16:20,205 --> 02:16:23,205
 We'll get down at the next station
 and we'll go to Bombay.

1331
02:16:31,583 --> 02:16:34,583
 We've been after chickens.

1332
02:16:34,619 --> 02:16:37,619
 Will we spare a hen ifwe find one?

1333
02:16:39,991 --> 02:16:42,991
 Let go... leave her!

1334
02:16:44,462 --> 02:16:47,462
 Sister...

1335
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:51,168
 Help me!

1336
02:16:51,169 --> 02:16:51,635
 Leave me!

1337
02:16:51,636 --> 02:16:53,437
 How far can she run?

1338
02:16:53,438 --> 02:16:56,438
 Sister, do something!

1339
02:16:56,474 --> 02:16:58,509
 Look at her... there.

1340
02:16:58,510 --> 02:17:01,510
 Sister! Help me!

1341
02:18:09,214 --> 02:18:10,914
 Hi, how are you?

1342
02:18:10,915 --> 02:18:13,150
 l'm okay. Are you in Goa?

1343
02:18:13,151 --> 02:18:15,419
 No, l'm returning to Mumbai.

1344
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:16,287
 What?

1345
02:18:16,288 --> 02:18:18,122
 lt's a long story.

1346
02:18:18,123 --> 02:18:21,123
 ln my train, there were some goons.
 They were taking 25 kidnapped girls to Goa.

1347
02:18:22,560 --> 02:18:24,194
 Somehow, l managed to save them.

1348
02:18:24,195 --> 02:18:26,997
 l'm on my way back
 to Mumbai with them.

1349
02:18:26,998 --> 02:18:29,333
 What! Are you all right?

1350
02:18:29,334 --> 02:18:31,001
 Tell me about it, what happened?

1351
02:18:31,002 --> 02:18:32,836
 Don't worry, nothing's happened to me.

1352
02:18:32,837 --> 02:18:34,004
 Are you sure?

1353
02:18:34,005 --> 02:18:37,005
 l'm perfectly all right, really.

1354
02:18:37,742 --> 02:18:40,742
 You're too much, Kalpana.

1355
02:18:41,346 --> 02:18:44,346
 But it's also what l like the
 most about you.

1356
02:18:44,349 --> 02:18:45,649
 What...?

1357
02:18:45,650 --> 02:18:47,751
 This habit of helping others.

1358
02:18:47,752 --> 02:18:49,687
 The first time l saw you,

1359
02:18:49,688 --> 02:18:52,688
 you were helping some
 disabled girls across a ditch.

1360
02:18:55,527 --> 02:18:58,362
 How do you know that?

1361
02:18:58,363 --> 02:19:01,363
 There's so much l haven't told you.

1362
02:19:01,499 --> 02:19:03,200
 Stuffyou'll be amazed to hear.

1363
02:19:03,201 --> 02:19:05,936
 Drop the melodrama and tell me.

1364
02:19:05,937 --> 02:19:08,937
 Not like this...
 when l'm saying it,

1365
02:19:09,174 --> 02:19:11,942
 l got to see the look on your face.

1366
02:19:11,943 --> 02:19:13,744
 So, l'll tell it to you once l'm back.

1367
02:19:13,745 --> 02:19:14,912
 See you.

1368
02:19:14,913 --> 02:19:17,114
 Take care, bye.

1369
02:19:17,115 --> 02:19:20,115
 Bye.

1370
02:19:29,461 --> 02:19:32,461
 The biggest news is about kidnapped girls,
 trafficking in human organs and flesh trade.

1371
02:19:34,766 --> 02:19:37,766
 Last night's revelation has
 stunned everyone.

1372
02:19:38,336 --> 02:19:41,336
 25 girls from villages in North lndia lured to
 the city on the pretext of giving jobs...

1373
02:19:42,907 --> 02:19:45,907
 were being taken from Mumbai to Goa.
 With the help of some soldiers,

1374
02:19:48,813 --> 02:19:50,814
 Kalpana rescued them.

1375
02:19:50,815 --> 02:19:53,815
 lnvestigations reveal that organs have already
 been harvested from these girls.

1376
02:19:55,320 --> 02:19:58,320
 Several girls have been operated surgically
 and their kidneys have been removed.

1377
02:19:59,357 --> 02:20:02,357
 Now they were en route to Goa,
 to be pressed into the flesh trade.

1378
02:20:04,996 --> 02:20:07,996
 lt's apparently a full-fledged racket,
 flourishing right across the country.

1379
02:20:08,900 --> 02:20:11,900
 lnvestigations indicate the possible
 involvement of influential people.

1380
02:20:14,005 --> 02:20:16,940
 lnformation given by the rescued girls has
 led to a country-wide crackdown.

1381
02:20:16,941 --> 02:20:19,941
 Several suspects are
 being questioned.

1382
02:20:21,179 --> 02:20:24,179
 Most ofthem are women and young girls,
 more than half ofwhom are children.

1383
02:20:37,996 --> 02:20:38,929
 Hello

1384
02:20:38,930 --> 02:20:41,930
 l'm Constable Vyjayanti.
 From Bombay Municipal Hospital.

1385
02:20:42,834 --> 02:20:45,135
 Yes, go on.

1386
02:20:45,136 --> 02:20:48,136
 Look, you sent 25 girls...?
 - Yes?

1387
02:20:49,607 --> 02:20:52,607
 Two are missing, without a trace.

1388
02:20:54,312 --> 02:20:56,780
 Please come over here
 and check them out.

1389
02:20:56,781 --> 02:20:59,650
 Please do not mention
 that l've tipped you.

1390
02:20:59,651 --> 02:21:02,651
 Some very influential people
 are behind it.

1391
02:21:17,535 --> 02:21:19,803
 Madam... here...?
 At this hour?

1392
02:21:19,804 --> 02:21:21,038
 Please come in the morning.

1393
02:21:21,039 --> 02:21:23,240
 The girls will be let offtomorrow morning.

1394
02:21:23,241 --> 02:21:24,942
 l had brought 25 girls.

1395
02:21:24,943 --> 02:21:26,276
 There are only 23 here.

1396
02:21:26,277 --> 02:21:28,512
 Where are the two girls?

1397
02:21:28,513 --> 02:21:30,280
 You are mistaken.

1398
02:21:30,281 --> 02:21:31,748
 You brought 23.

1399
02:21:31,749 --> 02:21:33,450
 Don't you lie!

1400
02:21:33,451 --> 02:21:36,451
 l have a list, of names.

1401
02:21:47,298 --> 02:21:50,298
 Good evening, sir.

1402
02:21:51,769 --> 02:21:53,437
 Yes.

1403
02:21:53,438 --> 02:21:56,273
 You brought in 25 girls.

1404
02:21:56,274 --> 02:21:57,040
 Who are you?

1405
02:21:57,041 --> 02:21:58,575
 Ghajini.

1406
02:21:58,576 --> 02:22:01,278
 Ghajini Dharmatma.

1407
02:22:01,279 --> 02:22:04,279
 23 out of 25 named my men.
 l'd let it pass.

1408
02:22:07,285 --> 02:22:10,285
 But these two, pointed fingers at me.

1409
02:22:12,390 --> 02:22:14,324
 Where are the two girls?

1410
02:22:14,325 --> 02:22:17,325
 Dead and dumped in the sea.

1411
02:22:19,197 --> 02:22:22,197
 Are you asking to know more?

1412
02:22:26,104 --> 02:22:28,205
 Because of beasts like you,

1413
02:22:28,206 --> 02:22:31,206
 girls are afraid to step out
 oftheir homes.

1414
02:22:35,146 --> 02:22:38,146
 Of how many apparitions of men,
 should women beware?

1415
02:22:39,150 --> 02:22:41,919
 Of keepers offaith and religion?

1416
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:43,554
 Of doctors?

1417
02:22:43,555 --> 02:22:46,555
 At work places, in schools, colleges?

1418
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:05,840
 Hello

1419
02:23:24,062 --> 02:23:27,062
 Dead and dumped in the sea.

1420
02:23:41,012 --> 02:23:41,678
 Hello?

1421
02:23:41,679 --> 02:23:44,679
 Vyjayanti speaking...

1422
02:23:44,916 --> 02:23:46,116
 Go on.

1423
02:23:46,117 --> 02:23:49,117
 They're planning to kill you.

1424
02:23:51,055 --> 02:23:53,423
 Please do not go home.

1425
02:23:53,424 --> 02:23:55,359
 Go elsewhere.

1426
02:23:55,360 --> 02:23:58,360
 They're hiding inside your house.

1427
02:24:32,563 --> 02:24:35,563
 What happened?
 - A power failure... hold it.

1428
02:24:54,185 --> 02:24:57,185
 The door is locked from inside.
 She's in here.

1429
02:25:00,058 --> 02:25:03,058
 Find her.

1430
02:26:10,995 --> 02:26:13,995
 Kalpana...?

1431
02:26:20,338 --> 02:26:23,338
 Kalpana

1432
02:26:50,635 --> 02:26:53,635
 Kalpana

1433
02:27:07,718 --> 02:27:10,718
 Don't go away... don't!

1434
02:27:39,517 --> 02:27:42,517
 Fast.

1435
02:28:16,921 --> 02:28:19,256
 Hey!

1436
02:28:19,257 --> 02:28:22,257
 Look!

1437
02:28:25,129 --> 02:28:26,630
 What's it?

1438
02:28:26,631 --> 02:28:28,164
 She must've gone that way.

1439
02:28:28,165 --> 02:28:31,165
 Go.

1440
02:29:14,745 --> 02:29:15,512
 Hello?

1441
02:29:15,513 --> 02:29:18,513
 Hello Kalpana... Kalpana...

1442
02:29:52,049 --> 02:29:55,049
 Kalpana

1443
02:29:58,889 --> 02:30:01,889
 Kalpana

1444
02:30:02,760 --> 02:30:05,760


1445
02:30:25,416 --> 02:30:28,416
 Go away, Sachin.

1446
02:30:28,853 --> 02:30:29,486
 Get out.

1447
02:30:29,487 --> 02:30:32,487
 Kalpana... what...?

1448
02:30:33,924 --> 02:30:36,924
 What happened...?

1449
02:30:41,265 --> 02:30:44,265
 Ghajini

1450
02:30:47,938 --> 02:30:50,938
 Ghajini

1451
02:31:03,454 --> 02:31:04,954
 Kalpana!

1452
02:31:04,955 --> 02:31:07,955
 Kalpana...

1453
02:32:00,344 --> 02:32:03,344
 Kalpana

1454
02:32:33,310 --> 02:32:36,310
 No!

1455
02:34:19,083 --> 02:34:22,083
 l'm Sunita. l'm a medical student.

1456
02:36:05,322 --> 02:36:06,656
 Forgive me.

1457
02:36:06,657 --> 02:36:08,624
 Even l'm responsible for
 the state you're in.

1458
02:36:08,625 --> 02:36:10,860
 l'll take you to Ghajini.

1459
02:36:10,861 --> 02:36:12,395
 l'll bring back your memories.

1460
02:36:12,396 --> 02:36:15,396
 l got to talk to him! Now!

1461
02:36:21,739 --> 02:36:24,240
 Hello... hello?

1462
02:36:24,241 --> 02:36:26,476
 My name is Sanjay.

1463
02:36:26,477 --> 02:36:27,643
 What?

1464
02:36:27,644 --> 02:36:30,313
 Sanjay Singhania.

1465
02:36:30,314 --> 02:36:33,314
 Your name is Ghajini.

1466
02:36:33,550 --> 02:36:36,550
 Do you remember the first ofJuly, 2006?

1467
02:36:37,388 --> 02:36:40,388
 You may forget, but l cannot forget.

1468
02:36:41,258 --> 02:36:44,193
 lt's the only thing l remember.

1469
02:36:44,194 --> 02:36:47,194
 Leaving you alive was a mistake.

1470
02:36:47,631 --> 02:36:50,631
 But now, l'll finish you off.

1471
02:36:52,269 --> 02:36:54,203
 This time, no sparing you.

1472
02:36:54,204 --> 02:36:57,204
 Wait for your death. l'm coming.

1473
02:36:58,409 --> 02:37:01,409
 Damn you!

1474
02:37:01,745 --> 02:37:04,745
 Damn... a short-term memory-loss
 patient is reminding me?

1475
02:37:10,687 --> 02:37:13,687
 Get the cars.
 We're going into my den.

1476
02:37:14,625 --> 02:37:17,625
 Let him come to my area.

1477
02:37:17,928 --> 02:37:20,928
 After l'm through,

1478
02:37:20,964 --> 02:37:23,964
 they won't find even a fingernail on him.

1479
02:37:38,382 --> 02:37:40,116
 They're going somewhere.

1480
02:37:40,117 --> 02:37:43,117
 Follow them.

1481
02:38:21,291 --> 02:38:22,825
 They're stopping here.

1482
02:38:22,826 --> 02:38:25,595
 Which one is Ghajini?

1483
02:38:25,596 --> 02:38:28,596
 The man in white.

1484
02:38:39,576 --> 02:38:41,544
 This looks like a dangerous area.

1485
02:38:41,545 --> 02:38:44,545
 l think we shouldn't wait here.

1486
02:38:47,851 --> 02:38:49,285
 You can't kill him so easily.

1487
02:38:49,286 --> 02:38:50,553
 You can't kill him so easily.

1488
02:38:50,554 --> 02:38:52,021
 There are too many ofthem in there.

1489
02:38:52,022 --> 02:38:54,056
 Stop! We'll get him when he's alone.

1490
02:38:54,057 --> 02:38:55,424
 This is a very dangerous area.

1491
02:38:55,425 --> 02:38:58,425
 Have you gone mad?

1492
02:39:00,731 --> 02:39:03,731
 Oh God!

1493
02:39:17,915 --> 02:39:20,915
 Hey stop... Where are you going?
 Entry is barred

1494
02:40:15,606 --> 02:40:18,606
 He's here! Tell the boss.

1495
02:40:31,888 --> 02:40:33,990
 He's coming!

1496
02:40:33,991 --> 02:40:35,191
 Move it...

1497
02:40:35,192 --> 02:40:36,759
 let's get him!

1498
02:40:36,760 --> 02:40:39,295
 Don't let him get away!
 - Get the irons...

1499
02:40:39,296 --> 02:40:42,296
 He won't get away!
 - Don't let him in.

1500
02:42:15,892 --> 02:42:18,892
 Boss...

1501
02:42:38,215 --> 02:42:41,215
 Now you're gone... finished!

1502
02:48:32,969 --> 02:48:34,336
 Brother...

1503
02:48:34,337 --> 02:48:37,172
 help me... save me!

1504
02:48:37,173 --> 02:48:39,541
 Ghajini is coming... that way!

1505
02:48:39,542 --> 02:48:41,176
 Please, help me!

1506
02:48:41,177 --> 02:48:42,511
 l'm Prakash!

1507
02:48:42,512 --> 02:48:43,512
 Have you forgotten?

1508
02:48:43,513 --> 02:48:45,047
 We came for Ghajini!

1509
02:48:45,048 --> 02:48:46,515
 Look at how badly he has bruised me!

1510
02:48:46,516 --> 02:48:49,516
 l'm Prakash...
 Ghajini did this to me.

1511
02:48:50,854 --> 02:48:52,020
 He hit me so badly.

1512
02:48:52,021 --> 02:48:54,690
 He's a very dangerous man!

1513
02:48:54,691 --> 02:48:56,458
 Very dangerous!

1514
02:48:56,459 --> 02:48:58,360
 He's coming that way.

1515
02:48:58,361 --> 02:49:00,729
 Keep an eye out for him.

1516
02:49:00,730 --> 02:49:02,464
 Keep an eye on him.

1517
02:49:02,465 --> 02:49:04,032
 Watch out

1518
02:49:04,033 --> 02:49:07,033
 Cunning man...very cunning man.

1519
02:49:14,010 --> 02:49:17,010
 Got you!

1520
02:49:39,169 --> 02:49:40,903
 Got you!

1521
02:49:40,904 --> 02:49:43,904
 Short term memory loss...

1522
02:49:44,574 --> 02:49:47,574
 Look at my face.

1523
02:49:47,577 --> 02:49:48,911
 Look.

1524
02:49:48,912 --> 02:49:51,046
 l am Ghajini.

1525
02:49:51,047 --> 02:49:52,548
 l am.

1526
02:49:52,549 --> 02:49:55,549
 l am the one you wanted to kill.

1527
02:49:55,552 --> 02:49:58,552
 Do you remember why?

1528
02:50:03,826 --> 02:50:06,826
 Your memory is too weak,

1529
02:50:06,963 --> 02:50:09,831
 lasts you forjust 15 minutes.

1530
02:50:09,832 --> 02:50:12,801
 But have no regrets.

1531
02:50:12,802 --> 02:50:15,802
 ln these final 15 minutes ofyour life,
 l'll give the action replay, over again.

1532
02:50:31,521 --> 02:50:34,356
 Remember the rod...?

1533
02:50:34,357 --> 02:50:37,357
 The one that l used to kill your fiancee?

1534
02:50:38,962 --> 02:50:41,697
 Somewhat like this one...

1535
02:50:41,698 --> 02:50:44,698
 it comes to your mind?

1536
02:50:48,771 --> 02:50:51,771
 l killed her right in front ofyour eyes.

1537
02:50:59,249 --> 02:51:01,650
 Before l kill you,

1538
02:51:01,651 --> 02:51:04,651
 l'll show you exactly
 how l killed your Kalpana.

1539
02:51:08,825 --> 02:51:11,825
 Watch this.

1540
02:55:33,089 --> 02:55:36,089
 Kalpana Home for Orphans

1541
02:56:01,050 --> 02:56:04,050
 Let's go cut the cake.
 - Yes... let's all go.

1542
02:56:08,357 --> 02:56:11,357
 Time to cut your cake.

1543
02:56:12,028 --> 02:56:14,896
 Wait!

1544
02:56:14,897 --> 02:56:17,897
 Sanjay, what's her name?

1545
02:56:19,936 --> 02:56:22,936
 Rahul... no.

1546
02:56:26,876 --> 02:56:29,811
 Pooja.

1547
02:56:29,812 --> 02:56:31,379
 You read it here!

1548
02:56:31,380 --> 02:56:33,548
 Cheater... cheater...

1549
02:56:33,549 --> 02:56:36,549
 Happy birthday to you.

1550
02:58:15,451 --> 02:58:18,451


1551
02:58:30,366 --> 02:58:33,201
 Pathways, streams and rivers all change

1552
02:58:33,202 --> 02:58:36,071
 Glimmering lamps cast lights of change

1553
02:58:36,072 --> 02:58:39,072
 When the change strikes life's rhythm

1554
02:58:39,108 --> 02:58:42,043
 The rhythm ofthe rain will also change

1555
02:58:42,044 --> 02:58:45,044
 And the nature of seasons will change

1556
02:58:47,983 --> 02:58:50,983
 But l shall forever be...

1557
02:58:52,121 --> 02:58:55,121
 the same to you as l've been

1558
02:58:56,125 --> 02:58:59,125
 Arm in arm, with you my mate,

1559
02:59:01,897 --> 02:59:04,799
 every moment,

1560
02:59:04,800 --> 02:59:07,800
 always

1561
02:59:23,119 --> 02:59:26,119
 How was it that you came to me

1562
02:59:28,958 --> 02:59:31,958
 How blessed l was,
 but it's hard to believe

1563
02:59:32,928 --> 02:59:35,928
 You descended upon
 life's placid lake...

1564
02:59:36,932 --> 02:59:39,932
 like a rare Moon,

1565
02:59:42,838 --> 02:59:45,707
 slowly,

1566
02:59:45,708 --> 02:59:48,708
 gently

1567
02:59:51,413 --> 02:59:54,413
 Under winter's Suns,

1568
02:59:55,084 --> 02:59:58,084
 like a warm melody...

1569
02:59:58,521 --> 03:00:01,521
 you caressed me, now you're gone

1570
03:00:04,527 --> 03:00:07,527
 But l still live, enthralled

1571
03:00:10,266 --> 03:00:13,266
 ln you, my peace.
 You are my passion

1572
03:00:16,205 --> 03:00:19,205
 Why didn't l find you before?

1573
03:00:21,710 --> 03:00:24,710
 How was it that you came to me...
 how blessed l was, but it's hard to believe

1574
03:02:27,970 --> 03:02:30,970
 And once l believed,

1575
03:02:35,377 --> 03:02:38,377
 that the Creator finds
 His urge no more

1576
03:02:41,116 --> 03:02:44,116
 And then He created you...

1577
03:02:47,089 --> 03:02:50,089
 for me to sing...

1578
03:02:52,861 --> 03:02:55,861
