You want one with you in it?

Uh, no.

3
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,710

- I got you good.
- Jesus Christ.

14
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:11,322
That was such a good one.

15
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,698
Oh, my God.

16
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,076
- Ow.
- My God.

17
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,952
- Give me a minute.
- How was your flight?

18
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,705
It was fine. Come here.
How was yours?

19
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,290
- It was good.
- Good to see you.

20
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:22,583
It was good.

21
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,293
- Let's get your bag.
- Thanks.

22
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,961
Glad you made an effort.
What are you wearing?

23
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:27,380
I didn't know we were going
to a Bar Mitzvah.

24
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,423
It's a Bat Mitzvah.

25
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,219
Um, I'm actually, like...

26
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,555
I'm, like, a few hundred miles
away right now.

27
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:39,809
I jumped on a flight this morning
and I'm gonna be gone for the day.

28
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,479
But I'll be back tomorrow,
so don't worry about it.

29
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:44,688
God, dude.

30
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,942
28 shows in 30 days.
Have I missed one?

31
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,278
Have I missed one?

32
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,072
No, no. I'm not burned out.

33
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,616
I just have to... I just needed
to come home for a sec.

34
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,625
WOMAN:
So this is the high school, huh?

35
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,086
It looks like a mental ward.

36
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:09,505
Hey, do you really...
do you like this car?

37
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:11,799
Yeah, I like the car.
Why?

38
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,968
I don't know. It's just... that didn't
sound very convincing.

39
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,595
WOMAN: - No, baby, I like the...
- 'Cause I loved my other car.

40
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,984
- What are you looking for?
- Do you have any gum?

41
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,228
- Wait... wait a minute. I got...
- Oh.

42
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,017
- What do you... gum? It's right here.
- Yeah.

43
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,395
Oh, okay.

44
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,566
Thanks for coming with me.

45
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,067
Well, I'm excited
to meet everybody.

46
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,695
Finally get some dirt on you.

47
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:35,406
- You want some?
- No. I really don't want that.

48
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:37,825
- Have it. Have it.
- That's really gross.

49
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,160
(woman laughs)

50
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,662
WOMAN ON P.A.:
Boarding all rows for ﬂight...

51
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,873
Hey, where... where's Emily?

52
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,791
She had to work at the hospital
this weekend. She can't come.

53
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,711
What?
That frickin' sucks.

54
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:50,337
What, are you gonna cry about it?

55
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,839
I'm disappointed.

56
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:54,300
I'm not disappointed.
It's the two of us. It's gonna be great.

57
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,010
- No, I know...
- It's like old times.

58
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,678
Just you and me, ese.

59
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,764
Okay, "pawl"

60
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,310
Okay, "Cholo." What, are you cultivating
a new reunion personality?

61
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,270
People say "ese."
People say ese all the time.

62
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:07,980
Okay.
Yes, Jason.

63
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:10,649
Listen, man.
I gotta... I gotta go.

64
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,276
- Oh, we just passed it...
(tires screech)

65
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:13,819
Aw...!

66
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,783
(Doorbell rings)

67
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,038
- Oh! Oh, my God.
(groaning)

68
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,709
- What's up, man?
(laughs)

69
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,294
Damn, you got fat, sucker.

70
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,046
I got fat? What, did you eat
one of your kids?

71
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:33,964
- I'm sexy. Hi, honey.
- What... hi.

72
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,341
- How you doing?
- Good to see you again.

73
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,426
- Welcome home. Come in.
- Sure.

74
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,595
MAN: You guys.

75
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,430
(woman laughs)

76
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,432
Hey, look who's here.

77
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,642
- Hi!
WOMAN: - Hi!

78
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,227
JAKE:
Samantha.

79
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,895
JESS:
It's so good to see you again.

80
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,314
- Oh, so good to see...
(crying)

81
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,316
That is a cute sweater vest.

82
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:53,817
- They're in matching sweaters.
JAKE: - Just like his daddy.

83
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,528
- They're in matching sweaters.
- What up, Sammy?

84
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,697
I'm so happy to see you.

85
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,324
Too bad you didn't come
with a shotgun.

86
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,243
- I'm so happy you guys are here.
- I'd blow my brains out.

87
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,495
Come on. All right, all right.
Enough about the kid.

88
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:07,748
- Come check this out.
SAMANTHA: - Go say hi...

89
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,125
Hi, darling.
SAMANTHA: - Lilly, say hi to Aunt Jess.

90
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,293
Yeah, that's the other one.

91
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,461
It's cool.
You don't have to...

92
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,629
- Lilly, baby.
- It's all right.

93
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:15,756
She don't care, you don't care.
She's not gonna remember.

94
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,258
(Crying continues)
- Okay.

95
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,426
Okay, okay. Shh.

96
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,220
There he is.

97
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:22,596
- Is that you, buddy?
- Jake? Oh.

98
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,556
- Man, how are you? Good?
- Long time no see.

99
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,016
- Hi, I'm Jess.
- Scott.

100
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,643
Scott?
Nice to meet you.

101
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,812
- Suki.
- Suki, nice to meet you. Oh...

102
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,231
- you're the one that lives in Japan.
- Yes.

103
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:33,691
No.
Not from me, man.

104
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,151
I see you every day.
I got you on Google Alert.

105
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,695
- Oh, yeah?
- Is that weird?

106
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,571
- That's totally weird, dude.
- Is it weird?

107
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,207
Naw, it's not weird.
My mom's got me on Google Alert.

108
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:43,450
Oh, my God. We've been trying
to get out there for so long.

109
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,286
It just... I don't know,
hasn't happened.

110
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,787
Aw, don't worry about it.
You got time.

111
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,122
- You got time. I'm not going anywhere.
- Is it amazing?

112
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,166
JAKE: Don't worry about it.
I don't come back, either,

113
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,752
and I live in driving distance.

114
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,546
- Ladies first.
- Thank you.

115
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:57,339
JAKE: Wait a minute.
Is that who I think it is out there?

116
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,759
Oh, my God.
Look who it is.

117
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,845
MARTY: - Aw, Jacob.
- What is going on?

118
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,388
- Hey, look who's here. Look who's here.
JAKE: - You're in trouble right here.

119
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,224
Dude, things must be going great, man.
You look fantastic.

120
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:11,395
Um, can I say I can't complain
without sounding like I'm bragging?

121
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,650
(laughs)
- 'Cause I can't complain.

122
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,273
AJ: How long did it take
you guys to drive in?

123
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,650
Oh, about an hour, hour and a half.
There was a little bit of traffic.

124
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,277
MARTY: Hour and a half.
That's not nearly enough.

125
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:19,737
You gotta get away
from here, Jake.

126
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,780
You gotta run away
and not look back.

127
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,907
You're better than that
is what I'm trying to say.

128
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,868
Cully, really?
What is in here?

129
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:28,537
- Nut up, bro.
- This is straight vodka.

130
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,414
No, there's a little bit
of soda in it.

131
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,374
You're gonna have so much fun
at Grandma and Grandpa's.

132
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,584
Yes, you are.

133
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,544
Mommy's gonna have
a night without you.

134
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:39,089
She loves you, but she needs to be
with some adults, doesn't she?

135
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,342
Hey, hey, guys.
We got an idea.

136
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,344
Is there any way we can sneak
some of this booze in?

137
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,846
Isn't there...
there's an open bar, right?

138
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,806
I know that.
It's the principle of the thing.

139
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,600
Yeah, we did it in high school
for like, every event.

140
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,560
Why would we not do it now?
'Cause we're too "mature"?

141
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,228
- We're adults?
- Exactly.

142
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,855
Hey, do you have any flasks?

143
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,899
'Cause I feel like we're each
gonna need one.

144
00:05:57,066 --> 00:06:00,194
I can't find anything with a lid.
How you doing?

145
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,363
- Nothing.
- I'm sorry, you guys.

146
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,491
I got two kids and a wife who
doesn't let me drink in public any more.

147
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,034
- Shocking.
- I made an exception for tonight,

148
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,744
which I'm beginning to think
was a mistake.

149
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:11,705
I found this, but I need something small
enough to fit down my pants comfortably.

150
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,290
SAMANTHA: Are you touching yourself
in front of my children?

151
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,958
MARTY:
I'm not doing it sexually.

152
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,877
What's your kid got over there?

153
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,592
- Could we get a ride?
- It's good.

154
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,594
My mom dropped us off.

155
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,763
Wow, so ninth grade of you.

156
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,224
I actually haven't driven a car
since I moved to Tokyo.

157
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:31,475
Yeah, I don't own a car.

158
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,185
That's what happens
when you live in an actual city.

159
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:35,562
I live in New York City, Snooki.

160
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,065
- Great. Then you can drive.
- How does that make sense?

161
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,275
Hey, no, no, no, no.
Don't leave.

162
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,736
(Car starts)
- God damn it.

163
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,196
I thought we were
gonna go together.

164
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,907
Sam and I just gotta drop
the kids off with her mom.

165
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,992
It's only gonna be a minute.
They live like, two miles away.

166
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,911
Mom.

167
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,747
She's coming. Mommy's coming.
You're a big boy.

168
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,707
Hey, listen. You don't
have to pretend to like my kids.

169
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,835
So cute. No, man.
It's completely genuine.

170
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,754
- Come on, Bubba. I know.
- He's awesome.

171
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,215
I'm not saying I don't think
they're cool. They're super cool.

172
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,510
I love the shit out of 'em.
But it doesn't mean you have to.

173
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,847
You know what I mean?
So, where'd you park?

174
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,932
Uh, I took a cab.

175
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,520
CD PLAYING: ♪ Oh, you can't say
"pfft" on the radio ♪

176
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,063
♪ You can't say "pfft"
on the radio... ♪

177
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,107
Can we turn this off,
please, honey?

178
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,525
Did you not
put the night light in here?

179
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,152
Pfft, Pfft. pfft.

180
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,679
CULLY: - Please turn this off.
SAMANTHA: - Shoot.

181
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:28,031
My mother still doesn't have one.
Reeves, I think we have your CD in here.

182
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,535
- I know he listens to it all the time.
REEVES: - God, no. Please, no.

183
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,579
Bro, we're listening to your CD.

184
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,581
Pfft, oh!

185
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,040
(Cully laughs)
I'm playing it right now.

186
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,750
- No, please don't.
- Come on, man.

187
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,170
- Don't. No, no, no, no, no.
- I wanna listen to it with you.

188
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,088
I don't wanna hear that shit.
Come on.

189
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,507
You're gonna cause a commotion
at this thing tonight.

190
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,509
- You know that?
- Yeah.

191
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,804
Uh, I wasn't gonna come, man.
I had no intention of coming.

192
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,806
(Lilly babbling)
- I just...

193
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,349
you know, I got the itch.

194
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,477
Yeah, dude.
I know exactly what you mean.

195
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,271
I actually got a lot of work
to do tonight.

196
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,898
Work to do?

197
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,649
Yeah, I don't know how well
you remember this,

198
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,111
but apparently I guess I was kind of
an asshole in high school.

199
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,905
"Kind of an asshole," honey?

200
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,742
I loved you guys,
but kinda hated you, didn't I?

201
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,243
- Got the night light?
- Yes.

202
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,163
- Awesome.
- I... aw, I forgot his poo-poo.

203
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,499
God damn it.
Honey, we gotta go.

204
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,750
His "poo-poo"?

205
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:23,086
Oh, it's his blankie.
Yeah.

206
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,379
You gonna get
your poo-poo, buddy?

207
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,590
- Oh.
(laughs)

208
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,259
REEVES: - That's hilarious.
- Yeah.

209
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,787
CULLY: This is gonna be good.
It's gonna be good.

210
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:34,848
I'm gonna apologize to some people
tonight and I'm gonna mean it.

211
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,767
So who you going for tonight?

212
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,018
What do you mean?

213
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,520
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

214
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,940
You're like, a single, handsome,
interesting, funny guy.

215
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,194
You'd be the belle
of the ball tonight.

216
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,798
You can choose anybody you want.
Who you gonna go for?

217
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,111
You sound a little jealous
up there, brother.

218
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,029
- Yeah, right?
- I am jealous.

219
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,198
I am... for once, I'm actually jealous
of this asshole.

220
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,784
Oh, yeah. It must be such a burden
having to go home

221
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,203
to your awesome doctor wife
every night. I'm so sorry, AJ.

222
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,205
- Marty...
- Well-paying job,

223
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,581
- your four-bedroom house.
- Marty...

224
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,375
- What a nightmare.
- Answer the question.

225
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,377
- Answer the question.
- I don't know.

226
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,170
- Oh, come on.
- I haven't given it much thought.

227
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,256
- Come on... I'm a married man.
- Exactly.

228
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,674
I've been having sex with my eyes closed
for the last three years.

229
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,760
I gotta live vicariously through you.
It's a hypothetical question.

230
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,696
If you could hook up with any girl
you went to high school with,

231
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:16,515
- who would you choose?
- I don't know. Anna, probably.

232
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,183
- Anna? Anna?
- Maybe, I don't know if she's single.

233
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,269
- She's probably not single.
- That's a great choice.

234
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,563
That is a great choice.
That is a very good choice.

235
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,897
(Speaking Japanese)

236
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,357
No, no, no.
It's a good choice.

237
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:28,068
(Scott speaking Japanese)

238
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,296
MARTY: What are you saying
back there?

239
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,075
MARTY: I just prefer Ralph Macchio.
I don't know why that's a bad thing.

240
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,203
JAKE: $20 says he says something
about beating me.

241
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,455
(German accent)
Well, your little Volvo

242
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,708
did not pass the American test.

243
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,002
Rental car, too.
Didn't even try.

244
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,088
- I'm not even-I'm not doing it.
MARTY: - All right, Mario Andretti.

245
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,466
- I'm not doing it.
- He'll never stop giving you shit, man.

246
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,427
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too, man.

247
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,178
It's good to see everybody, man.

248
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,598
God, everyone came back.
Is Mary coming?

249
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,558
Uh, no, I don't think so.

250
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:02,477
I think Sam said she got an e-mail from
her saying she wasn't gonna make it.

251
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,230
(Scoffs) Oh, well.

252
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:08,233
What if she did make it?
Would you still have brought Jess?

253
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,736
- Yeah. Why...
- You sure?

254
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:11,903
Why wouldn't I?

255
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,781
- Don't... don't give me that.
SCOTT: - It's a fair question, bro.

256
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,783
One, two, three.

257
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,328
(Camera shutter clicks)

258
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,251
JESS: - Look at this place.
PHOTOGRAPHER: - Complimentary photo?

259
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,544
MARTY: - Yes.
JAKE: - Uh...

260
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,921
PHOTOGRAPHER: - Right over here, guys.
JESS: - Yeah, you boys go ahead.

261
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,965
No, no, no.
It's your school. Go ahead.

262
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,718
SCOTT: All right, let's do it.
Just the guys.

263
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,345
Why are you so excited
for this photograph?

264
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,763
Right here, guys.

265
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,307
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Three, two, one.

266
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,267
(Camera shutter clicks)

267
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,477
JESS: - Hi.
JULIE: - Hi. Welcome. Good to see you.

268
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,729
Come over here.
The name tags are right over here.

269
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,856
So glad you guys made it.

270
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,400
Everybody's upstairs for a drink, so
after you get a name tag, go up there...

271
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,986
- Dude.
- Yeah, hi! Nice to see you.

272
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,822
- Grab a drink upstairs, okay?
- Oh, you mean... what do you want?

273
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,699
Okay.
She's busy.

274
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,077
I get the night off of name duty.

275
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,244
What's... what is that?

276
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,330
JAKE: I panic every time I go
to introduce her to somebody.

277
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,624
- I forget their name.
- So I introduce myself.

278
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,334
I'm like,
"Hi, I'm Jess. You are?"

279
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,544
Yeah, so the two of you guys
have it all figured out. I love that.

280
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,713
She's got it all figured out.
She just takes care of me.

281
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,881
We're gonna get drinks.
We'll see you in there.

282
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,049
- Okay.
- I'm so going.

283
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,467
I can't stop looking
at her boobs.

284
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,386
(laughs)

285
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:20,847
Okay, so whatever you need tonight,
I am your wingman.

286
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,516
- Oh, you're gonna be my wingman?
- Yeah.

287
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,017
Please don't do that.
You're the worst...

288
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,327
I love you, but you're
the worst wingman.

289
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,838
What are you talking about?
I'm the best wingman.

290
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,146
Yeah, you really hooked it up
with Julie.

291
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,354
- I'm the best wingman in the world.
- See, the worst wingman in the world

292
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,483
always says they're the best
wingman in the world.

293
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,193
- But I'm the best, though.
- Yeah, that's my point.

294
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,321
- So you ready for this?
- We'll see.

295
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,198
How about some shots?

296
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,491
I love you.

297
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:43,370
MARTY: Dude, that wasn't on purpose.
That wasn't part of the game.

298
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:44,705
Okay, how was I supposed
to know she was pregnant?

299
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:45,872
How were you supposed to know
she was pregnant?

300
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,166
Second of all, I'm the one
who came off badly

301
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,238
- and you came off really well.
- Yeah, but you just came off, like...

302
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,378
AJ: That was
good wingmanship.

303
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,005
No, I came off like I have racist,
weird friends who say things like,

304
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,507
"Of course you're pregnant.
You're a Latina."

305
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:56,758
You're not your friends, though.
You're not your friends.

306
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,135
Wait, wait.
Stay in the shadows.

307
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,470
I'm so glad you're here.

308
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,055
- Yo, what's up?
- Oh.

309
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,015
Went ahead and made
your name tag for you.

310
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,892
- Ooh, okay.
- Let's stick it.

311
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,061
Maybe.
Okay, yeah.

312
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,730
- Be...
(camera shutter clicks)

313
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,898
...serious. That was-
sorry, that one wasn't good.

314
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,401
- Can we do it again, please?
JULIE: - Welcome, welcome. Come in.

315
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,611
Look at Reeves.
It's happening already.

316
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:20,073
- Could I get some singles, please?
JULIE: - Everybody grab a name tag.

317
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,242
Hey, Reeves, man.
I gotta borrow you for just one second.

318
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,578
- Okay? He'll be right back.
- Oh.

319
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,580
No, he won't.
Don't follow him.

320
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:27,914

321

324
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,132
Can we get two shots of tequila
and two Stellas, please?

325
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,009
Jake?

326
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:41,094
- Hey, man.
- Oh, my God.

327
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,054
- How you doing?
- Good. What's going on, man?

328
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,724
- This is Jess.
- Hi, this is my wife Olivia.

329
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,350
- Hi.
- Hi, How are you doing?

330
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,769
- Jake, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

331
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,896
Can you believe this?

332
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,064
(laughing)

333
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,943
What are you doing?

334
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,612
- Garrity?
- Cully.

335
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:02,616
Dude. Oh, my God, look at you.
You look all normal and shit.

336
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:05,285
You look like a frickin'
J.Crew ad over here.

337
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,620
Look at this guy.

338
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,371
JAKE: You got, like,
a Jude Law thing happening.

339
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,166
You do.
You look just like Jude Law.

340
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,335
OLIVIA: - As opposed to what?
- Yeah.

341
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:14,878
OLIVIA:
Who did you used to look like?

342
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:20,675
What's your name again?

343
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:24,012
- Uh, Peter.
- Peter.

344
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,806
I was a dick to you
back in high school, wasn't I?

345
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,308
PETER: - What are you...
CULLY: - Let me buy his drink.

346
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,853
- No, it's... it's an open bar.
- Is it? Double vodka, no mixers.

347
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,188
Here, take your tip back.

348
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:34,606
- I'll leave a tip for you.
- I-i-it's fine.

349
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,615
Uh, complimentary photo?

350
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:46,243
Oh, sure.

351
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,998
You want anybody in it with you?

352
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,333
Oh, no. It's okay.

353
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,837
I can't believe they chose this hotel.
It's perfect.

354
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,216
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

355
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,969
(Yelling)
- Oh. my God!

356
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,556
- You look amazing!
- Look how skinny you are!

357
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,478
Hi, can I get my picture taken
with you too?

358
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,522
- Yep. Mm-hmm. Okay.
- Thank you so much.

359
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,650
Ahem.

360
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,278
- Gorgeous. Let's take a photo.
- Come here. Come on.

361
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,197
Do you mind if we do it again?
I think I blinked.

362
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,826
Yeah, I think I did, too.

363
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,911
Let's get this jag poppin'.

364
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,289
Oh, G-Money.

365
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,750
Get low, baby.
Come on, get in here.

366
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,753
Wha-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, oh!

367
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,339
- What's up, man?
- This is Andre.

368
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:42,948
- This is one of my oldest friends.
- How you doing?

369
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,719
- Hi.
- This is my wife Olivia.

370
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,722
- Hi.
- This is your wife?

371
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,515
Yeah, we're... we're married.

372
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,225
You married
a white girl, for real?

373
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,852
You...

374
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,104
Wow.
That's crazy.

375
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,064
- He's, uh...
- Yeah.

376
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,572
This is so amazing.

377
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,575
Well, it should be. I've been looking
forward to this for a very long time.

378
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,870
- So have I.
- Oh.

379
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,539
- Mortgage broker, huh?
- Mortgage-yes.

380
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,334
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sure you're awesome at it.

381
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,543
- I just...
- Really?

382
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,795
I didn't see it coming.
I'm not gonna lie. I...

383
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,714
- I feel good about that now.
- Watch it, man.

384
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,174
What is this?
What's that?

385
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,343
Oh, this is, uh-this is Julie's.

386
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,261
Yeah.
You stole it from her?

387
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,679
NICK:
I just thought it'd be more fun

388
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,140
if I just filmed all of us
getting wasted tonight.

389
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,601
- Done. More shots?
- That'd be really funny.

390
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:35,769
- Yes.
- Done.

391
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,521
They're not all for me.
They're for everybody.

392
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,106
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

393
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,610
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. How are you?

394
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,321
- So good.
- Now the party can start.

395
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,198
You heard it, everybody.

396
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,116
Now the party can start.

397
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,956
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

398
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,836
AJ:
I miss you so much, Cully.

399
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,965
I can't do this.

400
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,510
I just thought you were
really into rap music.

401
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,804
Yeah, well, I was.
I still am.

402
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,306
No, I know.
But I thought that meant

403
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,600
you liked Coolio and stuff.

404
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,519
I didn't know that meant
you thought you were black.

405
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:20,105
So, you guys
come with boyfriends

406
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,524
or you married or...

407
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,150
I'm married.

408
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,860
Who... who'd you marry?

409
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,238
Oh, you've seen the commercials?

410
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,532
♪ Calling Ford, calling Ford... ♪

411
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,617
You married Cully?

412
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,828
AJ: Dude, dude, look.
There she is.

413
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,037
There's Anna.

414
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,706
God, she looks good,
doesn't she?

415
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,165
Yeah, she looks really glamorous.

416
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,334
ANNA:
Let me help you with that.

417
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,128
MARTY:
Is she gonna...

418
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,506
- We'll... we'll work up to it.
- Yeah, okay.

419
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,676
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

420
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:50,844
- Okay.
MAN: - Where's she going?

421
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,137
I'll be right back.

422
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,388
She probably won't come back.
I think you scared her off.

423
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,849
Good job.
You scared her off.

424
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,142
She might not come back.

425
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,768
MAN: So, is this
getting serious or what?

426
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,353
Yeah, of course it's getting serious.
We've been together for, like,

427
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,896
three and a half years.

428
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,189
NICK:
So, it's serious?

429
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,983
I would say it's serious, yes.

430
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,069
How black, uh...
did you act?

431
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:11,031
Did I act? Like on a scale
from one to 10?

432
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,408
Like on a scale
from white to black?

433
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,869
I'd say, like, a...

434
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,829
a dark gray.

435
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,165
No, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing with my camera?

436
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,543
Okay, hi, yeah. No, we need
to put the camera back right now.

437
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,628
- Vanillo, I'm serious. Just...
- But I'm gonna get everybody.

438
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,547
Yeah, right,
you will get everybody.

439
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:28,923
- Just put it back. It's just perfect.
- I'm gonna put it back.

440
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,383
- I set up perfectly.
- I'll put it back.

441
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,760
- Okay, thank you.
- After I do this.

442
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:32,927
No, Vanillo!

443
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,721
I got a baby girl.
You wanna see a picture?

444
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,890
Yeah, I do.

445
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,892
She's a beauty.

446
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,226
- She is beautiful.
- There she is.

447
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,520
Wait a minute.
You don't have any babies.

448
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,065
- A boat? You have a boat?
- Yeah, I told you about the boat.

449
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,232
- Do you have any...
- You didn't tell me...

450
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,234
- I don't have any boats, no.
- Kids.

451
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,489
Does he have any kids?
Look at the guy.

452
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:50,737
He's like the king
of New York City.

453
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,948
He's out dining on Wall Street,
sleeping with models and stuff.

454
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,159
- Tell her. Tell her about the models.
- Uh...

455
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,661
Being genuine is not something

456
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:02,540
that comes easily for me
as far as an emotion.

457
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,919
I want to make sure
that my "genuinity"

458
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,546
is expressing itself
clearly to you.

459
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,632
Sure.
And it's so good to see you.

460
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,883
SAM:
So good to see you.

461
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,011
It's been... I'm gonna come
by the dealership.

462
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,013
- Good to see you, Peter.
- I just-my friends are...

463
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,348
Oh, jackpot.
Look at that table.

464
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:22,227
No, no, no, no, no.
Come back. Come back.

465
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,854
Let them do their thing.
Let them talk.

466
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,023
Look at them.

467
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,944
Oh, I have so much work to do
to that table.

468
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,613
I know. I know you do.
Just don't be too aggressive, you know?

469
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,949
'Cause then it gets
a little assholey.

470
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,243
Well, nice catching up
with you, Elise.

471
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,287
Oh, my God.
This is what I mean.

472
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,956
This is why you're
the worst wingman in the world.

473
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,291
Oh, come on, man.
I was trying to create demand.

474
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,043
- What?
- It's called salesmanship.

475
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,878
- What?
- If she knows that you've been

476
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,630
with other high-quality women,
she's gonna be like,

477
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,258
"Oh, maybe I can be
one of those high-quality women."

478
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:54,634
Do you really believe
what you're saying?

479
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,136
- Makes a lot of sense.
- That makes sense, not what you did.

480
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,721
You showed her photos of your
goddamn boat. Who does that?

481
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,473
She was asking
to see baby pictures. I was...

482
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,725
Yeah, which is when
normal people say, "Oh, I'm so sorry.

483
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,978
I don't have any babies
with my wife yet to take pictures of."

484
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,479
It's a conversation killer.
It's a conversation killer.

485
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,106
No, no, no.
You wearing a captain's hat

486
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,649
standing next
to a little grounded boat...

487
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,526
that's a real conversation killer.

488
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,952
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

489
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,787
- What are you doing?
- You left me out there for, like,

490
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,873
I don't even know how long,
all by myself.

491
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,124
I've been in here two minutes.

492
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,626
- Yeah, two minutes is too long.
- Stop.

493
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,045
All your friends are out there.

494
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,840
I don't care about them.
I <i>care</i> about being with you.

495
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,508
Aw.

496
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,553
But Cully did ask

497
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,640
if I could go out to the car
with him and Dre.

498
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,517
That's what this is about.

499
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,561
Go ahead.

500
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,479
- I can go?
- Yeah.

501
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,023
- You wanna come?
- No.

502
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,524
I'm gonna hang out with Sam.

503
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,610
- No, just come on...
- But you can't have more than two puffs

504
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,528
because you're
a lightweight, remember?

505
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,071
- Oh, is that what I am?
- Don't.

506
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,324
- Really?
- Yes, don't you remember?

507
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,874
Why are you looking at me?

508
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,420
I love looking at you.

509
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,675
Could look at you forever.

510
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,969
That's sweet.

511
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,266
You need to go.
I love you.

512
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,268
- Nobody in here.
- No, baby.

513
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,146
Someone's gonna come in here.
Someone's gonna come in.

514
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:31,481
I love you, leave.

515
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,441
I gotta do my makeup.

516
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,444
One puff, lightweight.
Don't forget.

517
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,324
(Jake coughing)

518
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,159
JAKE: Dre, you're a lifesaver
with this stuff.

519
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,578
DRE: No, I got glaucoma, dude.
So I got a cause.

520
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,913
(all laughing)

521
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,748
I can't handle any more
two-minute conversations, man.

522
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,959
At least you only got a two-minute
conversation from Todd.

523
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,420
I got a 20-minute conversation
from his wife, Lauren.

524
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,172
JAKE: Well, at least you're talking
about something interesting.

525
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,258
I gotta talk about mortgages

526
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,010
and default loans
and all this bullshit.

527
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,554
I still can't believe
that he's a mortgage broker.

528
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,604
You'd have had
a job like this, too,

529
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,225
if you weren't so damn
good at something.

530
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,769
You know what I'm good at?
Two-minute conversations.

531
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,938
- I'm the king of them.
- Then tell me how to get out of them.

532
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,565
You just got to tell them
you gotta go to the bathroom, dude.

533
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,110
I've gone to the bathroom
like, 12 times today.

534
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,279
I'm sure Sam
really appreciates that.

535
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,780
She's a big girl.

536
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,116
- Kinda.
JAKE: - Are you saying she's a big girl?

537
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,451
CULLY: - She was in high school.
(laughing)

538
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,788
Oh, Sam. I don't know how
she deals with you sometimes, man.

539
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,623
- I love you, though.
- You know what, dude?

540
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,751
You just... none of you guys
know shit.

541
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,003
You're not married.

542
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,463
CULLY: You know what?
Marry Jess. Then we'll talk.

543
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,133
Are you... you want me to marry Jess?
Is that what you're saying?

544
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,218
CULLY: Yeah, marry Jess, dude.
You'll know my pain then.

545
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:43,469
DRE: Don't do it.
Don't do this.

546
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,514
It's okay. All right.
Open the glove box.

547
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,351
Grab that envelope right there.

548
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,188
Hey, Cully.
Look at this.

549
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,565
What is it?

550
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:00,278
DRE:
Oh, shit.

551
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,863
- What?
JAKE: - Yep.

552
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,031
REEVES: - Wow.
- Whoa.

553
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,283
CULLY: - When'd you get that?
- Bought it like, eight months ago.

554
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,036
You bought it eight months ago
and you never told me about it?

555
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:11,539
No, well, I'm gonna tell you.
I gotta tell her first.

556
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:12,790
But, yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

557
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:15,626
It just hasn't quite been...
just hasn't been quite right.

558
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,420
You'd leave it in an envelope?

559
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,631
Yeah, it's better than a ring box.

560
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,427
And, like, so she can find it and say,
"I wonder what's in the ring box."

561
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:26,471
- Well, why haven't you given it to her?
- Boom.

562
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:27,805
(Coughs)

563
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,016
I tri... I mean, I've planned
a few things

564
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,601
and they just weren't exactly right.

565
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:34,020
Women don't care
how you ask them.

566
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,065
All they care is that you're stupid
enough to ask them.

567
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,941
All they want is the ring.

568
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,361
I know people, man.
That's what I do.

569
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,738
I don't sing,
I don't sell cars,

570
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:46,366
I don't do what you do.

571
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,452
That's how I eat.

572
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,287
- It's why you eat?
- That's how I eat.

573
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:52,747
What does that mean?

574
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:55,875
I don't think you know people
as good as you think you know people.

575
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,168
It's what I do, all right?

576
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:59,879
Just... it sounds like you put a lot of
pressure on yourself, too,

577
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:03,091
to make it super perfect. I mean, you
gotta be open to spontaneity, too, man.

578
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,301
I mean, if you're ready to do it,
just pull the trigger, you know?

579
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:08,388
I mean, you've built
a real solid foundation.

580
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,723
You've got the job,
you got the nice car...

581
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,600
- I don't know about the car.
- Yeah, dude.

582
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,477
I think it's a very adult car.

583
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,521
DRE: - I think it's very nice.
REEVES: - I do, too.

584
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,731
I think it sucks, dude.

585
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,531
JAKE: - That's good.
DRE: - Trick Daddy had a Volvo, man.

586
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,402
- These are nice cars.
CULLY: - I put him in this Volvo.

587
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,173
REEVES: - They're very safe.
CULLY: - They're very safe.

588
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,989
That's a good point.
That is a good point, Reeves.

589
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:28,408
DRE:
The back seat is nice.

590
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,118
CULLY: - You don't drive a Volvo.
DRE: - This is nice. My grandmother

591
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,787
- would be proud of it.
- If Ford owns Volvo, it's a good car.

592
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:35,081
"Consumer Reports" number one
every single year.

593
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,416
I'm fried, dude.

594
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,043
- Look who it is.
CULLY: - Oh, holy shit.

595
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,254
- I thought she wasn't coming.
DRE: - Oh, shit.

596
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:44,298
DRE:
Yo, who is that she's with?

597
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,384
When's the last time
you spoke to her?

598
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,220
Like eight years ago.

599
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:50,972
Did you tell Jess about her?

600
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,724
Yeah, of course
I told Jess about her.

601
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:55,476
Oh, this is gonna get weird.

602
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,311
Yep.

603
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,367
How we doing here?
Did you get enough to eat?

604
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,619
If I wanted to be in a boy band,
I woulda been in a boy band.

605
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,121
I woulda started my own.

606
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,873
We would've been
bigger than NSync.

607
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,376
It looked like she waved at you.
Was she like, one of your... shorties?

608
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:23,004
You're in real estate,
I'm in real estate.

609
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,172
- What?
- What?

610
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,966
(whispering)

611
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,676
Fingerlings.

612
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:30,761
Fingerlingin' good.

613
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,307
Finger lickin' good.
Joke.

614
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,018
Do you mind if I sit here?

615
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,937
Oh, hey.
Hey.

616
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,606
- Hey.
- How's it going?

617
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,232
- Good.
- Did you see Marty yet?

618
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,525
- He's...
- I haven't. Is he here?

619
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:45,753
He's somewhere.
He's around somewhere.

620
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,487
- He was looking for you.
- Oh, wow.

621
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,700
♪ Futures made of ♪

622
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:55,036
- ♪ Virtual insanity... ♪
- Hi!

623
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:56,704
Julie.
Be prepared.

624
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,206
Julie. Okay.

625
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:02,001
- My gosh, Mary.
- Hi.

626
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,295
- I am so glad you guys made it.
- Okay.

627
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:06,214
Good luck, okay?
Ow!

628
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,674
You got some nuts on you.

629
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,719
JESS: - Hey.
- Hi.

630
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:13,054
- Hey.
- Hi.

631
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,264
I am... I know we took a long time
and I apologize.

632
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,225
- It's okay.
- It was Cully.

633
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,559
He had to go
to the bathroom really bad.

634
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,853
Baby, it's fine.
I've just been over there

635
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,689
talking to Sam, who is really,
really, really cool.

636
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,441
- Like, I love her.
- I know. Tim's...

637
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,693
Love her. And then this
really weird guy came up

638
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,029
who was like, tall, he's skinny,
he's really annoying,

639
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,823
with like, crazy weird hair.

640
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,159
- Was he touching you at all?
- No.

641
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:36,536
- You sure?
- No, he wasn't.

642
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,412
But he was driving me crazy.

643
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,749
Oh, shit. Uh...

644
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,042
- Hi.
- How are you?

645
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,211
- Hi... I'm sorry, that was...
MARY: - Sorry. Yeah, no. Of course.

646
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:46,712
I apologize. I went right in.

647
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,548
- No. Hi.
- I... I...

648
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,007
Hi... hey.

649
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,175
- Hi, I'm Jess. Hi.
- This is Jess.

650
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:52,885
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

651
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,512
Nice to meet you, too.
Mary, sorry.

652
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,931
- Oh, okay. Of course.
- Paul.

653
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:59,058
- Paul?
- The husband.

654
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,228
- Uh, this is Jess.
- I'm Jess.

655
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:03,729
Are you a classmate as well?

656
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,023
No, no. I'm his girlfriend.

657
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,693
I'm just here, supporting,
having fun.

658
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,612
Jake, that's
a pretty cool name.

659
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,114
MARY: - Yeah.
- Thank you.

660
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:14,407
PAUL: - I like that name.
- All right.

661
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:15,658
MARY:
Ah, four-letter word.

662
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,285
- Aren't you glad we came?
- I am glad.

663
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:20,705
I mean, I was really worried that...
but you've seen so many people...

664
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:25,543
Hi, sorry.
Is this... is this seat taken?

665
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,129
- No.
- No? Okay.

666
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:30,298
I'm just gonna join you guys.

667
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,552
LAUREN: - Hi.
- Hi.

668
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,680
That's for you.

669
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:40,600
What's this for?

670
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,727
I owe you three bucks.

671
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:45,688
- You do?
- Yeah.

672
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:48,149
Mr. Ferguson's physics class.

673
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:50,651
Junior year we went to the planetarium,
you remember?

674
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,279
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

675
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,906
I don't remember anything, really,

676
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:57,658
about junior year, though, so...

677
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:00,661
Oh, well, you let me borrow some money,
so I thought I'd pay you back.

678
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,913
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

679
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,666
- It's nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

680
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,501
(Softly) It's nice to see you.

681
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:08,919
Thanks.

682
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:11,631
You're actually the reason
that I switched to the tuba.

683
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,549
Really?

684
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:16,636
Um... I'm honored?

685
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,429
You shouldn't be.

686
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:21,766
I switched to the tuba because
it was too big to take home from school

687
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:24,310
so I didn't have to carry it
on the bus to and from school,

688
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,520
which meant that I didn't have
an instrument at the bus stop,

689
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,147
which meant that
you forgot that I was in band,

690
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,399
which meant that
you finally left me alone.

691
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,153
I owe you...

692
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,532
and you, and you, and you,

693
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,284
and you...

694
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:44,038
and you an apology.
Each and every single one of you...

695
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:45,831
- Okay, okay.
- From the bottom of my heart.

696
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:50,127
Yeah, okay, okay.
You've apologized enough

697
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,505
for everybody, to everybody.

698
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,840
Does everybody
accept my apology, though?

699
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,468
'Cause that's the thing
that is so important to me.

700
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,762
Yes.

701
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:03,391
They're all accepting it, babe.
You did good.

702
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,687
Really?

703
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,563
- We were known as the Smash Crew.
OLIVIA: - Mm-hmm.

704
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,691
When we weren't smashin',
we were sleeping.

705
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,984
And we always went to sleep
after we smashed.

706
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,820
No cuddling.
Tell her about it, baby.

707
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,781
GARRITY: - Smashing was dancing.
- Boom, yeah. That's what they call it.

708
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:20,700
- Look, I... cheers.
- Andre's kidding. It's like dancing.

709
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,660
No, it's funny.
I think it's funny.

710
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:24,870
I married a former wigger
and I had no idea.

711
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,706
It's hilarious.

712
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,333
Yeah, you might wanna "achay"
on the "worday," you know?

713
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,211
"The worday"?
What word?

714
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,422
Wigger?

715
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,757
- Yep, that one.
(Dre laughs)

716
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,218
I think, uh,
it's kind of offensive.

717
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,303
- Is it?
DRE: - Who's offended? We ain't.

718
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,471
MAN: - Not at all.
- They're not offended.

719
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,223
DRE: - Boom.
- I know, but it's two words

720
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,726
squished into one word,
and the one word would be offensive.

721
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,644
DRE: Ooh-whee, time-out.
Twenty seconds.

722
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:51,981
Excuse me, ladies.
Where are you guys sitting?

723
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,400
I don't know.
You got a spot for us?

724
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,361
I have a gentleman here who's willing
to open up two seats for you.

725
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,071
- Yay.
- Oh, ladies. Please sit down.

726
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,116
- Would you like to be our guest?
- Have a seat. Have a seat.

727
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:03,868
All right.

728
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,619
Wait. Wait. Time-out.

729
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,246
Switch.

730
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:08,956
WOMAN: - Are you kidding me?
- What?

731
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:10,166
- Ouch.
- What?

732
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,834
You coulda just said
you wanted to see...

733
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:13,794
DRE: I just wanted to see you
across the table.

734
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,756
- Uh-huh.
- Sit down, girl.

735
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:17,923
- Well, hello.
- How you doin?

736
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,216
- Good, how are you?
- Mm.

737
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:20,760
- Mm-hmm.
- Can I call you Snuggie?

738
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,386
Sure.

739
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,346
- Uh, you want a beer?
- I'll get it.

740
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:25,931
- You sure?
- You okay?

741
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,100
- I'm good, thank you.
PAUL: - Honey?

742
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,935
- I'll just do water now.
- Water.

743
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,562
Yeah.

744
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:34,565
- I'm sorry. What?
- Yes, I'm drinking water.

745
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:38,110
Yes, sorry. I lost the coin toss.
Designated driver.

746
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:41,530
SAM: Jess, you have to come look
at this baby's face.

747
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,824
- You're gonna die.
- I'm gonna go over there.

748
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,493
- I'll be back.
- All right.

749
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,287
Honey, look at this baby.
Look at that face.

750
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,122
WOMAN:
She is too much.

751
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,373
Oh, my God.

752
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,792
Seriously, why don't
you just stay here?

753
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,127
No, we live... we're just 45 minutes
out of town.

754
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:59,465
It's not that bad. It's so nice to...
sleep in your own bed.

755
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:02,760
(laughs) It makes me happy.

756
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:04,929
I'm really kind of shocked.

757
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,722
I didn't think
you were gonna show.

758
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:09,809
- Sam said you weren't coming.
- I wasn't, actually.

759
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,228
These things can kinda...

760
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,313
he convinced me last minute
to come by.

761
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,148
I think he's right.
I would've regretted it more...

762
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:20,152
- Ah. Convinced you.
- ...had I not come.

763
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,905
It's really good to see you.

764
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:28,494
- You, too.
- Yeah, I tried to find you online.

765
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,330
- Come on.
- There's a lot of Jake Staff ords.

766
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,749
I'm just saying.
Shocking.

767
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,543
You know I can't do any of that at all.

768
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:38,838
- I'm technologically ignorant.
- Yeah.

769
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,841
I don't have any of those things,
either, but I really...

770
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,509
No, I know. I know.

771
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,012
I looked.
You're not there, either.

772
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,268
You're married, man.

773
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,270
- That's a...
- Yeah.

774
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:57,064
Well...

775
00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:58,899
- Thank you.
- Sure.

776
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,527
- Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.
- Cheers.

777
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:03,028
Look who finally
decided to show up.

778
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,572
- I know.
- Looks so awkward.

779
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,198
It really is.

780
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:09,702
I'm so glad I never dated anyone
who went to our high school.

781
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,996
I could never handle that.

782
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,581
- No?
- Mmm.

783
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:17,293
Weren't you seeing someone
that whole year we had physics together?

784
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,295
Mmmmm.
Randie Rustenberg.

785
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:22,298
- Where is she?
- She's in Bolivia.

786
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:23,507
- She...
- Wow.

787
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:27,511
Yeah, she's a Jew for Jesus now.
She's down there doing missionary work.

788
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:31,765
- She seemed so punk rock.
- Yeah, she was.

789
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,977
I think that...

790
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:36,586
you date who you're supposed
to like in high school.

791
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,522
Not who you actually like.

792
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:43,402
- Did you like your boyfriend?
- I loved my boyfriend.

793
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:44,570
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

794
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,405
Even after he moved to Austin?

795
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,408
WOMAN:
Ahem...

796
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,911
- Oh, hello.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

797
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,495
- How you doing?
- Good.

798
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,414
I just had to come
and tell you that "Never Had"

799
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:56,916
is one of my top ten
favorite songs.

800
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,251
Wow, thank you very much.
Thanks.

801
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,419
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

802
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:01,921
Most favorite song ever.

803
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:05,424
Ah, well. Let's not go crazy.
All right.

804
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,302
So how did you remember
that he had moved to Austin?

805
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:09,970
I don't know.
Do you have a cigarette?

806
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:11,555
- Yeah, I do.
- I'm not just saying that

807
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:14,683
- because we were classmates.
- Oh, no. Don't worry. I believe you.

808
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,936
Can we smoke that?
Yeah, okay.

809
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,145
- Bye.
- Nice to see you again.

810
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,064
- Yeah, bye.
- All right, bye.

811
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,815
- He wanted to date me and I...
NICK: - You were dating somebody

812
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,692
- you were cooking with.
- That's not the way it was.

813
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:24,860
- That's what you were doing.
- He wanted to date me

814
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:27,279
- and I was with somebody already.
- And what happened?

815
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,281
She left her purse over here.

816
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,824
She was here?

817
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:33,160
Yeah, well, you were sitting
at the buffet and...

818
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:35,663
What? Okay, did she say anything
about being single?

819
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,081
- Why wouldn't you tell me that?
- Well, she didn't have a ring

820
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,457
on her finger.

821
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:39,930
You looked at her finger?
You're a married man.

822
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,605
- You looked at her finger.
- I did a ring check, I mean...

823
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,337
Oh, a ring check.
Is that something guys do?

824
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,255
You check... you always
check the ring, right, Scotty?

825
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:48,342
Um, you know, I don't...
I don't really...

826
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:50,928
- I don't... yeah, I checked.
- What?

827
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:52,183
- Yeah, I checked.
- Is this a thing...

828
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,974
Well, it's Anna. I went pretty hard
after her in high school, so I just...

829
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,393
- I was curious.
- Okay, I gotta go talk to her.

830
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,478
- I gotta go make a move.
- Let's get her over here.

831
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:00,938
- We can ask questions.
- Oh, no, no, no.

832
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:02,982
- No, no, no, it'd be good.
- No, no, no, don't do that.

833
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,651
I'm gonna have one more drink
like a gentleman.

834
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,396
- I'm gonna walk over there...
- Let's get her over here.

835
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,255
- I think you're on the wrong page...
- Let's get her over here.

836
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,573
- Anna. Anna.
- You're an asshole.

837
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,492
What are you doing?
You forgot your purse.

838
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,285
- You're crazy. Get over here.
- What an asshole.

839
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,413
You know Marty.
You remember my friend Marty.

840
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,239
- Don't say it to me like I'm retarded.
- You forgot your...

841
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,666
MARTY: In your falsetto,
condescending voice.

842
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,710
AJ: Get over here.
You remember my little friend Marty.

843
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:25,421
REEVES: - Wow.
ELISE: - You're in luck.

844
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,673
- I don't even smoke.
- What? You used to smoke like a chimney

845
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,591
- in high school.
- I know. I quit.

846
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,094
I don't even remember
the last time I bought a pack.

847
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:33,512
Well, Why'd you buy that one?

848
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,307
I don't know. I woke up this morning
and suddenly had the urge.

849
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,435
- No, no, thanks.
- Are you kidding me?

850
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:40,769
You just asked me if I had one.

851
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,841
Yes, because I wanted to get out
of there and I knew that you smoked.

852
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,314
- I don't smoke.
- No?

853
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,025
Mm-mm.

854
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:51,947
Come on.

855
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:53,532
- Just take one.
- Just be a bad influence, now.

856
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:55,075
Loser, everybody's doing it.

857
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,119
I've... honestly, I've never had
a cigarette in my entire life.

858
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,205
How is that even possible?

859
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:04,334
Aren't you supposed to be like,
this rock star?

860
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:07,713
I'm not a rock star.
I'm just a musician.

861
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:12,217
Traveling minstrel.

862
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,719
Nice.

863
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:17,056
So where's the Austin guy?

864
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,559
Huh?

865
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,311
- Where's he at?
- I don't know.

866
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,897
- We haven't spoken in years.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

867
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:27,733
It's okay.
It's in the past.

868
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,818
And what about the present?

869
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:32,571
- What about the present?
- Do you have a boyfriend?

870
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,823
Uh-huh.

871
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:40,704
- Long distance again?
- No, actually. Same city.

872
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,831
Well, where is he?

873
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,084
He's in Chicago
at a partners' meeting.

874
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,296
He's a partner.
He's a lawyer.

875
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,381
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Wow.

876
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,802
- Older?
- Yeah.

877
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,428
- How much older?
- Older.

878
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,097
Okay.

879
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:01,016
How'd you meet?

880
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:03,811
I... I sold his house.

881
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,273
Okay, let me guess.
He's divorced?

882
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:11,235
Okay, he's divorced.

883
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,946
The wife got the kids,
he got the house.

884
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:16,198
But he thought
it was too big for him, right?

885
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:20,953
So he just wanted like, a cooler,
smaller bachelor pad in the city,

886
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,455
somewhere in a high-rise?

887
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,374
- Nope.
- No?

888
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:28,544
No, no.
His new house is much bigger.

889
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,172
(Music plays)

890
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:44,560
NICK: - Those are different.
(gasps)

891
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,603
- Stop.
- It's this machine.

892
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,397
Are you getting everybody
on that, by the way?

893
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:49,898
- I'm trying to.
- 'Cause I just...

894
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:51,942
I can't just have it be your clique.
I need everybody.

895
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:54,319
You're right. You're right. And I think
there's a lesson in there for me.

896
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,321
JULIE:
Oh, good.

897
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,073
ANNA: Is that
his mother's earring?

898
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,783
Look, it looks like
a mother-of-pearl.

899
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,869
- He got away with that. Nobody ever...
- I know, right?

900
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,495
Back then it was, like,
that's how cool he is.

901
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,747
He could wear, like...
he could dress like a Village Person

902
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,292
- and still be cool.
(Anna laughs)

903
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,252
You had this amazing glow
in high school.

904
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:12,671
Yeah.
All these pictures. Crazy.

905
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,548
Well, I'd like to think
I still have that glow.

906
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:16,300
- You do, I think.
- That's not what I...

907
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,343
- I think you do.
AJ: - That's not what I meant.

908
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,391
Oh, man.
Oh, no.

909
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:26,268
- Yep.
- Can we not?

910
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:27,853
That was senior year.

911
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,314
- That was four days ago.
- Look how tiny you were.

912
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,940
(AJ laughs)
- Isn't it sad?

913
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,567
I was a tween.
I was still a tween.

914
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,112
I remember that day.
I got my first pube

915
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,531
and I thought I was turning into
a ﬂy-human hybrid

916
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,241
'cause I watched
too much science fiction.

917
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:44,244
- You're so funny.
- Well, thanks.

918
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:47,497
Clearly you had a much better time
in high school than I did.

919
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,458
I had a much better time
in high school than you did.

920
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:52,294
In fact, I think I had a much better
time in high school than anybody did.

921
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:54,546
What was the secret?

922
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,382
My mother actually...
she taught me very early on

923
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,468
how to have a very good time.

924
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:02,137
Wherever she is now,
she's probably drunk, having a blast.

925
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:03,513
JULIE:
Photo op!

926
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,224
That's why
whatever high school taught us,

927
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,101
I'll always remember
my very first lesson.

928
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,562
- Cheese.
- Yay!

929
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,231
- Can I get a copy of that?
- Let me see it.

930
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:13,785
- Should be one more.
- Oh, I gotta take this off.

931
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,984
- No, that's beautiful.
- And my eyes are a little closed.

932
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,569
- Do you want a hand with that?
- Here, I got it. I can get it.

933
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,279
Okay.

934
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,281
- All right. All righty.
- Okay.

935
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:23,325
- So much better.
JULIE: - Gorgeous.

936
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:24,618
- Ready?
JULIE: - All right, guys.

937
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,411
One, two, three.

938
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,829
JULIE: Cheese.

939
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,206
Oh, love it!

940
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:31,375
Can I get a fresh one?

941
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,090
You have a TV out here
or just the one back at the bar?

942
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,092
I'm sorry, sir.
The TV's actually in the bar.

943
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,510
Okay.

944
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:44,429
You ain't no Jake, bro.

945
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,349
Hey, honey.
Thanks for getting me a drink.

946
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:48,767
- Is he kidding?
- Let me get you a drink.

947
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,060
- No, it's fine.
- You sure?

948
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,688
Yeah, no. I just would like my husband
to ask me if I'd like a drink.

949
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,023
- It would be a nice gesture.
- You're the one that let him drink.

950
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,484
Let him drink? He's a big boy.
I'm not his babysitter.

951
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:59,778
Oh, come on. You know you're
his babysitter, so don't even...

952
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:01,947
- let's go look at pictures.
- Why don't you go be his babysitter?

953
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,282
- So I can have a night off.
- I think we're gonna...

954
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,135
babe, we're just gonna stay here
and have a little girl time.

955
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:06,785
- Okay. All right.
- Love you.

956
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:09,705
Wait, wait, look. This is Andre.

957
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,291
- That's funny. Yeah.
- He's dancing with his sister.

958
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:16,503
GARRITY:
Oh, my gosh.

959
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,968
Oh, my God.
Is that you?

960
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,348
Yep, that's me.

961
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:30,976
Well, there it is.

962
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:33,061
GARRITY:
Yep. There it is.

963
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,480
"G-Money."

964
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,359
GARRITY: That's my friend,
Brock, right there.

965
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,653
And with the "B.U.M. Equipment"
is Ross.

966
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,572
- Where'd you go?
OLIVIA: - Oh, I'm just...

967
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:46,074
seeing if I can get
any more "G-Money."

968
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,000
(sighs)

969
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,090
Hmm.

970
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,092
Shit.

971
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,345
Why's it feel so long ago?

972
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,681
(Chuckling)

973
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,851
Uh-huh.
Sassy.

974
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,563
Look at that.
Was that Christmas?

975
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,065
MARY: Yeah, it was.

976
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:22,903
And this was prom.

977
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,369
I guess so.

978
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:33,455
You know, I got my tiara like,
two, three weeks later.

979
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:43,173
Sorry you didn't get to wear it.

980
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,344
I wore it.

981
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:50,305
It was only in my room, but...

982
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,891
(chuckles)
- I wore it.

983
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:55,894
No, sorry.

984
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:00,190
No.

985
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:02,150
You don't wanna go over there?

986
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:03,693
No.

987
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,905
Do you wanna go over there?

988
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,157
I love you.

989
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:13,161
- Right?
- Mm-mm.

990
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,746
No.

991
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,165
I love each and all of you.
Thank you for accepting my apology.

992
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:20,377
Allowing us to be
besties again...

993
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:22,379
for the first time.

994
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:24,089
PETER: - It's fine.
- It is fine. It's great.

995
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,924
It's better than fine.
It's awesome.

996
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:29,594
Because if you didn't accept my apology,
I would have to force you to.

997
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,597
But I wouldn't use my fists,
'cause I ain't like that.

998
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,016
- I'd use my tongue.
- Sorry.

999
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,102
CULLY: Not only that,
it wouldn't be violent.

1000
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:39,271
It would be tender.
(chuckles)

1001
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:41,148
You would be like my cell mate.

1002
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,191
- And I would swallow...
- Oh, God.

1003
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,277
My pride.

1004
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:47,404
Sicko.

1005
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:51,783
Get your little funny-shaped head
out of the gutter there, chipmunk.

1006
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,579
- What is your problem?
- Honey.

1007
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,789
What? He knows I'm joking.

1008
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,292
He know... come on, come here.
You know I'm kidding, right?

1009
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:02,002
MAN: No, no. No, no.
Please...

1010
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:03,211
- Come on, hug it out.
- Honey...

1011
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:04,421
CULLY: I don't think you look
like a chipmunk.

1012
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:06,756
(Groans) I just can't...

1013
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:11,011
Hey, hey, Peter.
Hi. I'm sorry that...

1014
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:12,471
thanks for being
such a good sport.

1015
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,724
I... you know... I know he can be
a little aggressive and,

1016
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:18,727
you know, he's had
one too many drinks.

1017
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:21,021
But he really means well

1018
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:24,232
and he really is
such a sweet guy.

1019
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,318
And I know it was really important
to him to talk to you.

1020
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:29,738
No, no, no. it's...
I'm sorry.

1021
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:32,866
'Cause you must have
to say this to a lot of people.

1022
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:34,326
Huh?

1023
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,787
I... I have to go.

1024
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,917
REEVES: So, if I want a new house,
I should call you.

1025
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,794
Whatever.
I'm sure you need all sorts of houses

1026
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:47,547
for all those baby mamas
and groupies.

1027
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:48,757
Baby mamas?

1028
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:51,343
No, baby mamas get
their own baby mama condos,

1029
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,929
typically, and the groupies
are more of a road thing.

1030
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,972
Please, can I see your tour bus?

1031
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,517
"Never Had" is, like,
the best song of all time.

1032
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:01,102
- Yeah?
- Totally. Totes.

1033
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,941
- Best song?
- Ever.

1034
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:13,198
That song...

1035
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:17,327
I wrote it in like, two hours
and it barely made the album.

1036
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:19,579
It's kind of crazy
how people like it so much.

1037
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,791
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1038
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:29,214
Have you never heard the song?

1039
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:32,884
Yeah. What?
(laughs)

1040
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:36,721
I... I mean, you just
have to understand that...

1041
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:40,392
lam in the car all the time
'cause of my job.

1042
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,562
- Uh-huh.
- And I've got satellite radio,

1043
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:46,481
but I'm more of a talk radio
kind of girl.

1044
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:48,942
Uh-huh.

1045
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:52,445
You know what? I bet if I heard it,
I would recognize it.

1046
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:55,907
I'm sure.
I'm sure if I heard it, I'd know it.

1047
00:42:57,367 --> 00:43:00,161
The truth is,
I was only distantly aware

1048
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,414
that you were a musician.

1049
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:10,880
It's okay. It's all right.

1050
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:16,344
You're just... you're just telling me
that you're not with it.

1051
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,305
- Right?
- Sorry.

1052
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:21,141
It's all right.
Don't apologize.

1053
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:23,351
Hey, I really would love
to hear you play.

1054
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:27,188
It's pathetic
that I haven't heard you.

1055
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:31,610
It's not. No, it's not.
It's not pathetic.

1056
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,903
It just means that...

1057
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,156
that you're one of the few people here
that's talking to me

1058
00:43:36,323 --> 00:43:38,867
because of who I was,
not because of who I am.

1059
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,873
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1060
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,626
So...

1061
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,878
how many times
has he been divorced?

1062
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,882
- Twice.
- Twice?

1063
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:57,218
Third time's a charm.
That's what they say, right?

1064
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,137
Neither of us
want to get married, so...

1065
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:00,930
You don't want to get married?

1066
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:05,185
No? You don't wanna be
someone's wife someday?

1067
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:10,148
You don't wanna be
someone's third wife someday?

1068
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:15,153
It's cold.
Let's go inside.

1069
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,993
Well, well, well.
Where have you been all night?

1070
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,038
Just taking care
of my third child.

1071
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:26,498
Let's just get drunk.

1072
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:28,500
- I can't. I have to drive.
- Oh, crap. Sorry.

1073
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:30,210
Mary? Mary?

1074
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:31,836
(Gasps)
Wait. This... oh.

1075
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,546
- Come here. Hey.
- Scott.

1076
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,256
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my goodness.

1077
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,550
I heard you weren't gonna be here
and then I heard that you were and...

1078
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,219
- This is my husband.
PAUL: - How are you?

1079
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:41,846
- Scott. It's a... pull up a chair.
SAM: - How's your night been?

1080
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:45,058
Great, actually.
It's been really trippy

1081
00:44:45,225 --> 00:44:47,686
to look through
all these photographs

1082
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,521
and realize how old
we've gotten.

1083
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:50,855
- We're not that old.
MARY: - This one's finding out all my

1084
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,149
- secrets and tricks and everything.
- I feel old.

1085
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,777
ANNA: No, you definitely
didn't ask me to prom, AJ.

1086
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:59,239
I would've remembered it.
Definitely.

1087
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:01,783
You sure I never asked you?
I had to have asked you.

1088
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,702
No.

1089
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,329
Jason Maclntyre, Mike Brighty,

1090
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:08,748
Gabe Vertz asked me.

1091
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:10,875
You asked me to prom.

1092
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,169
But never you, AJ

1093
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:15,296
Oh, the carcass is ﬂoating
in the water already.

1094
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:18,216
Who'd you finally say yes to?
You went with a college guy.

1095
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:19,884
I went with a guy
who wasn't in our class.

1096
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,053
You went with a college guy.
So boring.

1097
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,221
Anyway, I thought prom
was kind of boring.

1098
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:26,015
- Sort of like a waste of time.
- No. No, no.

1099
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,059
- Prom was awesome.
MARTY: - I hated prom.

1100
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,436
I had the most miserable time,
but I don't think it was a waste...

1101
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:32,564
I think that's the point of prom...
to have a miserable time, right?

1102
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:34,149
I went with Jenny Sakamora.

1103
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:36,067
- Remember Jenny Sakamora?
- Wow.

1104
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:39,028
MARTY: She looked like one of
the Sand People in Star Wars.

1105
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:41,114
And the worst breath...
you can't believe this breath.

1106
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:43,575
And she wouldn't kiss me. That was
the irony. Wouldn't kiss me all night.

1107
00:45:43,742 --> 00:45:47,078
I don't think it was a waste of time.
That's kind of the point.

1108
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:48,714
I think it's supposed to be,
like, a rite of passage.

1109
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:51,791
I mean, can you imagine not being
disappointed at your prom?

1110
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,585
Seriously.

1111
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:56,004
Well, I mean... sorry.
You guys excluded.

1112
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:58,047
I'm sure you guys
weren't disappointed at prom.

1113
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:01,342
You genetic...
you genetic superhumans.

1114
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,428
- Ahem...
- What?

1115
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:07,682
- We didn't go, man. Remember?
- Yeah.

1116
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:11,561
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

1117
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:14,147
Why's he apologizing?

1118
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:16,608
Well, actually,
I didn't make it to prom because

1119
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:20,653
that was the first time
Dad had a heart attack.

1120
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:24,407
And so we just...
we didn't make it.

1121
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:27,452
We actually spent... I spent prom
in a hospital room with Jake.

1122
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,915
PAUL: Oh.

1123
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,586
Dude, we're going to Pretzels.

1124
00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:38,963
We're all going to Pretzels.
Let's go.

1125
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,840
Oh, look. It's my husband,
the event coordinator.

1126
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,133
CULLY: - Let's go!
- Oh, no.

1127
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,551
We're not... we're not really
going to Pretzels, are we?

1128
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:45,345
CULLY:
Yes, we are! Yes, we are.

1129
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:48,932
How is it possible that I'm not
in any of these pictures?

1130
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:52,101
It's like I didn't even go to school
with you guys.

1131
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:53,436
Maybe you don't really exist.

1132
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:56,189
I was very camera-shy, maybe.

1133
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,859
No, there's one.
There's gotta be one somewhere.

1134
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,778
I don't know.

1135
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:04,113
Anna.
We're doing shots.

1136
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,573
One more before Pretzels.

1137
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,158
I just need to steal her
for one photo.

1138
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:08,493
- Yeah, one photo.
- Real quick.

1139
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,870
Come back, though.
We're gonna be here.

1140
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:17,877
- What the hell are you doing?
- What are you talking about?

1141
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:19,379
What do you mean,
what am I talking about?

1142
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:21,881
You're flirting with her.
All night you've been ﬂirting with her.

1143
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,716
Don't be an asshole.

1144
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:26,219
I'm not being an asshole.
I just want... you're married.

1145
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:27,887
You remember, you're married
and you have a boat.

1146
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:29,264
I just wanted to make sure
you know that.

1147
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,015
- I do remember, Marty.
- You remember? Good, good, good.

1148
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,560
- I just want to make sure you remember.
- I especially remember.

1149
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:35,979
What does that mean,
"I especially remember"?

1150
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:40,275
It means...
I don't get to...

1151
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,571
- I don't get to do this.
- What are you talking about?

1152
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:45,738
- Do this?
- What do you care?

1153
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:48,074
You sleep with models.

1154
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:07,010
I slept with a model.

1155
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,345
Once, okay?

1156
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:10,763
No, I'm saying.
I'm just...

1157
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,932
- And she was a plus-sized model.
- What?

1158
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,476
What?

1159
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,979
You didn't tell me that.

1160
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:19,606
Whatever,
she was a plus-sized model.

1161
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:20,940
- You didn't tell me...
- She was still a model, okay?

1162
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:22,108
She was still a model.

1163
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:23,526
I found you.

1164
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:25,153
You did?
(gasps)

1165
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,280
You "Oh, my gosh"!

1166
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:29,073
- Yes, I did.
- Oh.

1167
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,575
REEVES: I love blurred
in the background.

1168
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:33,369
I forgot about those yellow shoes.

1169
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:35,830
- You forgot about 'em?
- Oh, wow.

1170
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:38,166
- I didn't.
- I was obsessed with...

1171
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:41,920
those were the first designer anything
I ever bought.

1172
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:44,297
- I wore those all the time.
- Yeah, I remember.

1173
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:47,258
I'd wear those in gym class
if they let me.

1174
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:52,639
Oh.
Look at me.

1175
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:55,224
Even there I look like
I just can't wait to get out.

1176
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:57,226
- Yeah.
- I would've never guessed

1177
00:48:57,393 --> 00:49:00,730
that I'd come to something like this
ten years later.

1178
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,318
How come you did?

1179
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,655
- Mmm.
- You don't know?

1180
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:10,657
Whoa!

1181
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,493
REEVES:
Oh, my God. Dude.

1182
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:16,162
You coming to Pretzels,
you little bitch? Let's go to Pretzels.

1183
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:17,997
- You're going to Pretzels right now?
- I was talking to him, not to you.

1184
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:19,582
- Oh. Yeah.
- Come on. But you can come.

1185
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:21,000
- I'm not calling you a bitch.
- Oh, thanks. That's really nice.

1186
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,609
- You guys are going right now?
- Come on! Pretzels!

1187
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:24,462
Okay. Okay.

1188
00:49:25,922 --> 00:49:28,341
You... you wanna
come to Pretzels?

1189
00:49:28,508 --> 00:49:31,052
Why would I need
to feel better about myself?

1190
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:32,845
That's exactly my point.
You don't, AJ.

1191
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,973
You own a frickin' boat,
so I don't know what you're doing.

1192
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,724
What... what is wrong
with you and the boat?

1193
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:37,934
You're acting
like a crazy person.

1194
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:40,853
Oh, yeah. I'm acting like a... shh.
Hey.

1195
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,689
You ready to go?
A little Pretzels?

1196
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:45,984
(Sighs)
I left my fake I.D. at home.

1197
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,528
(laughs)
You're gonna need that.

1198
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:51,447
Sorry, guys.

1199
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:52,907
You're not coming?

1200
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:55,076
That doesn't sound like
the Anna we remember.

1201
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:57,620
Yeah, the Anna in those pictures
would never leave a party early.

1202
00:49:57,787 --> 00:49:59,580
- Come on.
- The Anna in those pictures

1203
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:01,416
- was the party.
- Yeah, right.

1204
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,293
Wait. We're good?

1205
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,714
You're a big city boy now.
Let's see how you do on your own.

1206

Hey, you guys. We're going to Pretzels.
You guys going to Pretzels?

Pretzels? Moving on? Pretzels?
You guys going to Pretzels?

Oh, you guys gotta sign
the memory book before you go.

1209
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:20,893
- Oh...
- Just sign it.

1210
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,448
- We're gonna miss...
- Nope, you got two seconds.

CULLY: - Hey, Jake.

Yo, Jake.
Let's do it, bro.

1214
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:33,906
(laughing)
- Oh, my God.

1215
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:35,575
CULLY:
The thing broke.

1216

- Nope, I'm good.

Go sit on the couch.

Julie?

1219
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:45,835
- I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

1220
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:48,546
- No, I didn't...
- Go apologize to Julie.

1221
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,548
- Are you gonna apologize to her?
MARY: - What happened?

1222
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:53,551
Nothing happened other than Sam
is actually gonna kill him, I think.

1223
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:54,844
SAM:
No, I don't have your jacket.

1224
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:01,517
Uh, look. I just gotta tell you.
I'm happy you decided to come.

1225
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:05,605
Can I tell you something?

1226

You're the only reason I did.

1227

I'll see you at Pretzels.

1228

Okay.

why she's leaving already.

1239

She's too fun to be leaving.

1242
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:54,612
Would you have actually
gone home with her?

1243
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:57,990
I just wanted to know
I could've...

1250
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,518
I shouldn't have
bought the boat.

1251

- It was stupid. I...
- You wanted a boat.

1252
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:32,441
No, I just... I've taken
the boat out one time.

00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:27,194
Hi.

1358
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:32,241
I hate that there's always
a line for the girls.

1359
00:57:32,408 --> 00:57:34,910
I know. It's so unfair.

1360
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:36,996
Men have it way easier.

1361
00:57:37,163 --> 00:57:39,331
No. Jake and I
used to race each other.

1362
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:42,001
I'm quick.

1363
00:57:42,168 --> 00:57:44,795
Now I'm gonna have to be quick, though.
Since I said that.

1364
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,964
(Stall door bangs)

1365
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:49,633
All right.

1366
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:53,179
(Stall door bangs)

1367
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:00,144
AJ:
All right, slow down.

1368
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:02,563
- Kill the lights.
- Oh, shit.

1369
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:06,984
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

1370
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:09,111
AJ:
No, no, no.

1371
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:11,780
MARTY: Why does that house
look so familiar?

1372
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:13,866
I feel like we've been here before.

1373
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:15,701
- Really?
- Wait a minute.

1374
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:19,121
Dude, that's... I think that's
the house she grew up in.

1375
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,042
Yeah.

1376
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:25,085
Well, it's a nice house.

1377
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:26,921
Yeah.

1378
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,675
What do we do?
We just wait for her to go to bed?

1379
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,802
Let's... let's get supplies.

1380
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:35,221
Okay.

1381
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:39,016
Let's get a lot of supplies. I want to
paint this house whiter than a...

1382
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:42,770
- A Jimmy Buffet concert?
- A Jimmy Buffet concert.

1383
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:46,232
- A Phish show.
- Fo' sho.

1384
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:49,151
No, a Phish show.
Like the band Phish.

1385
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:50,945
AJ:
Fo' shizo.

1386
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:55,908
(voices overlapping,
music continues)

1387
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:02,873
(Jake laughing)

1388
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:06,544
I don't know
if that was horribly good

1389
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,462
or horribly bad
or horribly amazing.

1390
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:09,636
- Amazing.
- I know she was amazing,

1391
00:59:09,797 --> 00:59:11,423
but I'm not sure
about you and Frantz.

1392
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,634
She's amazing, isn't she?
I told you she was amazing.

1393
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:15,928
You're next, Jake.
And you're gonna do it with me, too.

1394
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,721
SUKI: - Yeah, you're next.
- Hey, hey.

1395
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,765
Hey.

1396
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:22,893
- Where you been?
- Baby, I think I'm gonna go.

1397
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,604
- What? No.
- Yeah. No, it's fine.

1398
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:28,566
It's totally fine.
I'm just really tired.

1399
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:30,109
Okay, okay. All right.
Let me just say bye to everybody.

1400
00:59:30,276 --> 00:59:31,443
No, no.
I want you to stay.

1401
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,112
- No, I want him to stay.
- We just met you.

1402
00:59:33,279 --> 00:59:34,912
- I want you to catch up.
- I'm not gonna stay without you.

1403
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,949
I swear to God,
I'm just really tired.

1404
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:40,119
It's fine.
It's totally fine. It's fine.

1405
00:59:40,286 --> 00:59:42,371
Just give me one minute.
I'm gonna talk to her.

1406
00:59:42,538 --> 00:59:44,623
I'm not even gonna say goodbye.
'Cause I'll see you in a minute.

1407
00:59:50,129 --> 00:59:51,755
(Scanner beeping)

1408
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:55,134
MARTY: - Thank you.
AJ: - Thanks, Case.

1409
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:57,928
You have no idea
what we're gonna do with this.

1410
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,222
No idea.
How are we...

1411
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:03,183
We're gonna be wiping
our asses for years.

1412
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,394
How are we gonna carry
all these?

1413
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:08,147
Oh, shit.
That's a good point.

1414
01:00:08,314 --> 01:00:11,650
Hey, Casey. Do you sell these
in a much bigger package?

1415
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:13,485
Make it easier to carry?

1416
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:16,488
I mean, like a 72-count pack?

1417
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:20,034
No?

1418
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,577
Look, if you wanna go,
let's just go.

1419
01:00:21,744 --> 01:00:23,495
No, I want to go.
I don't want you to go.

1420
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:26,290
No, I don't care.
I'm not gonna just stay here.

1421
01:00:26,457 --> 01:00:28,584
Oh, my God.
Please let me have the keys.

1422
01:00:28,751 --> 01:00:30,628
- No. Why?
- Can I have the keys?

1423
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:33,005
- Tell me why.
- Why? I'm tired.

1424
01:00:33,172 --> 01:00:36,216
- That's it.
- But why?

1425
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:37,843
What's... what is the deal?

1426
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,511
Okay.

1427
01:00:40,638 --> 01:00:43,057
- What happened?
- With what?

1428
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:45,476
Come on.

1429
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:47,811
You know,
I know everything about her.

1430
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:49,355
But I don't know
why you guys broke up.

1431
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:51,482
You've never told me
what happened.

1432
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:58,364
I don't know.

1433
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,204
Her dad died.

1434
01:01:05,371 --> 01:01:08,540
So she stayed here
and I stayed with her.

1435
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:14,797
And I don't...
things got really serious after that.

1436
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:20,928
I don't know.
I stayed as long as I could...

1437
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:24,390
till I just couldn't stay any more.

1438
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:27,810
I just needed to go to college
and grow up.

1439
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,064
So have you grown up now?

1440
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:35,651
What... what kind of-come on.
What... I don't...

1441
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:38,570
I really don't understand.
What you want me to say here?

1442
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:41,031
- Okay, let's just go.
- I don't want you to go.

1443
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,866
- I don't...
- I don't want you to go.

1444
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:45,369
Jake, I don't want you to go.

1445
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:48,831
It's your 10-year reunion.

1446
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:50,958
Just go inside.
I'm tired.

1447
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:52,876
Come back when you're ready.

1448
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,676
(Engine starts)

1449
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:04,596
(music continues)

1450
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,265
DRE:
Uh-oh.

1451
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:09,601
Garrity, now that's what I call
a rump roast.

1452
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:11,478
OLIVIA:
No, I get down.

1453
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:14,356
Hey.
Your girl got a little bit,

1454
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:16,316
but she's shakin' what she's got.

1455
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:17,943
GARRITY: She got some moves,
doesn't she?

1456
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,945
DRE: - Yeah.
- They're my new friends.

1457
01:02:20,112 --> 01:02:21,530
GARRITY: - Have fun.
- I'm her new friend.

1458
01:02:21,697 --> 01:02:23,115
OLIVIA:
I have new friends.

1459
01:02:23,282 --> 01:02:25,993
- You locked down a good one.
- Yeah, I know.

1460
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,580
DRE: Now me...
I'm about to go on a safari.

1461
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:30,748
(laughs)

1462
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:34,168
You're really never gonna
settle down, are you?

1463
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:37,838
Nah.
I tried already.

1464
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:40,257
GARRITY:
Yeah? What happened?

1465
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:44,762
Didn't stick.

1466
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:51,477
OLIVIA:
They love me. I'm fun.

1467
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:56,106
Come here, girl.
Mmm-mm.

1468
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:00,027
Come on, man.
Get in this.

1469
01:03:00,194 --> 01:03:01,487
Okay, that was fun.
That was fun.

1470
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:03,071
- What are we doing next?
- Yeah.

1471
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:05,824
SUKI: - Vanilla Ice?
SCOTT: - Ooh, genius. I like that.

1472
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:10,537
- So no go with Jess?
- She was tired.

1473
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:12,498
(Scott groans)

1474
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,753
- You all right, man?
- Mm-hmm.

1475
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,171
- What?
- Hey, guys.

1476
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:21,340
- What's up?
- Oh, look who decides to hang out

1477
01:03:21,507 --> 01:03:23,842
- for a second.
- Yeah. What's going on?

1478
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:25,677
You're in town for one night.

1479
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:27,721
And we haven't seen you once.
What's going on?

1480
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:29,264
- You guilting me?
- Maybe a little bit, yeah.

1481
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:30,557
Aww.

1482
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:33,018
SCOTT: - Who's the girl?
- Elise?

1483
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:35,020
Mm-hmm.
Who's Elise?

1484
01:03:35,187 --> 01:03:36,313
What do you mean,
"Who's Elise"?

1485
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,023
REEVES: - We went to school with her.
- Yeah, man.

1486
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:40,192
Physics class.
Mr. Ferguson.

1487
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:44,696
Nope, nothing.

1488
01:03:44,863 --> 01:03:47,032
What's going on with Mary?
How's it going?

1489
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,576
JAKE: What do you mean,
"How's it going"?

1490
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:52,037
Is she how you remember her?

1491
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:54,915
No.

1492
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:56,375
No?

1493
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:59,336
- But no one is, so...
- I know.

1494
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:01,046
- It's weird.
- It's cool.

1495
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:03,257
- It's cool?
- Yeah, I like it.

1496
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:04,758
You're so weird.

1497
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:06,718
(AJ, Marty
laughing, whispering)

1498
01:04:10,097 --> 01:04:11,557
AJ:
Oh, shit.

1499
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,935
This one's for
the Goo Goo Dolls.

1500
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:18,689
MARTY:
This one's for Darfur.

1501
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:21,233
It's so soft. I can't wait to use it
on my ass later.

1502
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,235
AJ: Should we use eggs?
Should we use eggs? Too much?

1503
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:25,737
- I think we're good for now.
- Okay.

1504
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:27,072
- Thanks.
- Let's do it at the same time.

1505
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:28,448
- Okay.
- Give yourself a little tail.

1506
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:30,367
- It's really nice.
- Oh, that's a good tail.

1507
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:31,618
How long is your tail?

1508
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:34,830
- See, my tail keeps breaking off.
- That's a good tail.

1509
01:04:34,997 --> 01:04:37,249
- Okay, you ready?
- Fo' sho!

1510
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:41,211
(laughing)

1511
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:44,631
- So much.
- There's so much already.

1512
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:46,925
- It's actually kind of beautiful.
- It's really beautiful.

1513
01:04:49,428 --> 01:04:53,599
- I hope she finds the beauty in it.
- I think she will.

1514
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:55,893
BARTENDER: Get your money out,
people. Don't be shy.

1515
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:57,811
- I'm still waiting on that beer, bro.
- Get your money out.

1516
01:04:57,978 --> 01:04:59,688
I mean, you got the time here.

1517
01:04:59,855 --> 01:05:01,690
BARTENDER: - What do you need?
MAN: - Yo, what's the holdup?

1518
01:05:01,857 --> 01:05:04,026
BARTENDER: - I see you.
- Hey.

1519
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,738
Where's... where's Paul?

1520
01:05:07,905 --> 01:05:10,449
Um, early day tomorrow.

1521
01:05:10,616 --> 01:05:14,119
- So called it a night.
- Mm.

1522
01:05:14,286 --> 01:05:15,913
Jer.
(slapping)

1523
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,706
SCOTT: - Jer?
- Where's Jess?

1524
01:05:17,873 --> 01:05:19,875
Uh, same.

1525
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:21,627
Tired.

1526
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:24,254
Tired.
She went back to the hotel.

1527
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,883
I think they're both tired
of our 10-year reunion.

1528
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:29,051
I would be.

1529
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:30,594
- Jen
MARY: - They should've shared a cab.

1530
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:33,680
JAKE: - That would've been awkward.
- There's only one of me.

1531
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,807
Excuse me, miss.
I'm so sorry.

1532
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:39,186
I'm going in.

1533
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:42,064
- Who wants a drink?
JERRY: - What are you doing?

1534
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:44,316
SCOTT: Baby, you in the weeds.
I'm just helping you out, all right?

1535
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:46,860
JERRY: - Everybody pays. Everybody pays.
- Yes, sir.

1536
01:05:47,027 --> 01:05:48,820
JERRY: Okay.
Who's next? Get your money out.

1537
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:51,406
- Uh, beer.
- What kind of beer? Bud?

1538
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:53,659
- Bud's fine.
- That's fine? Good.

1539
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,702
There you go. Bam.
Done. Mary, you?

1540
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,120
Um, just water.

1541
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:59,915
- You better be driving.
- I am driving.

1542
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:02,334
All right, all right. Water it is.
You fine, you fine.

1543
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:03,961
(Register beeps)
- Baby, what do you want?

1544
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:06,380
- Jack and Coke.
- Jack and Coke? Jack and Coke.

1545
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:09,257
Man, I made some serious drinks
while I was over in Japan.

1546
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:11,510
- I'm keeping all the tips.
- Amazing drinks.

1547
01:06:11,677 --> 01:06:13,053
I'm serious.
I'm definitely gonna come visit you.

1548
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:14,846
(Scott laughs)
- I promise.

1549
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:17,391
I know I've been saying it,
but I'm gonna come before you leave.

1550
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:19,559
- For sure.
- All right. I'm gonna hold you to that.

1551
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,853
- Wow.
- Done.

1552
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,563
When are you coming back?

1553
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:24,940
All night long,
I get that question.

1554
01:06:25,107 --> 01:06:27,025
You know what?
You wanna hear a dirty secret?

1555
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:29,569
I might never come back.

1556
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:35,117
This might be the last time
anybody ever sees Scotty P in Pretzels.

1557
01:06:36,952 --> 01:06:39,329
So you're just gonna leave? You're not
gonna come see your family,

1558
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,707
- your parents any more?
- Parents are retiring, man.

1559
01:06:41,873 --> 01:06:45,711
Both of 'em, this year.
So they're contemplating moving over.

1560
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:47,462
MARY: - Wow.
- What do you need?

1561
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:50,215
That's crazy.
And kind of sad.

1562
01:06:50,382 --> 01:06:52,300
SCOTT:
No, no, no.

1563
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:54,594
I love the fact that I got to
come back with Suki.

1564
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:57,389
But you know, I loved high school,
I loved college,

1565
01:06:57,556 --> 01:06:59,266
and now I love Japan, man.

1566
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:01,268
I love everything that I've been able
to do in my life.

1567
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:03,895
And, you know what? I'm probably
gonna love what I do next, right?

1568
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:05,897
Whatever happens.

1569
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:07,315
So...

1570
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:09,693
Why spend your time
looking back

1571
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,611
when you've got so much
to look forward to?

1572
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:14,114
You know what I'm saying?
Crazy, yeah.

1573
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:17,451
Sad? Pfft.
No. No way.

I'm doing it.

01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,966
I'm actually
allergic to pretzels, so...

1616
01:09:38,133 --> 01:09:40,594
- So...
- Being here is really dangerous for me.

1617
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,637
REEVES:
So your tongue is swelling up?

1618
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:44,472
- No, I have...
- That's important information.

1619
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:45,891
CULLY:
Reeves, they have your song.

1620

- Reeves!
- What's up?

1621
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:50,437
They have "Never Had."
They have "Never Had"!

01:09:53,565 --> 01:09:54,649
Oh, Jesus.

1623
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:56,902
They have your song
in the karaoke machine.

1624
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:58,737
I want you to sing it.

1625
01:09:58,904 --> 01:10:00,030
- Really? You're gonna do this...
- I would love it...

1626
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:02,240
I actually would love it
if you sang the song.

1627
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:04,951
Everybody, Reeves.
Who wants Reeves to sing the song?

1628
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:06,536
(cheering)

1629

Reeves!

1630
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,166
- You're gonna make me do this?
- I'm not gonna make you do it.

1631
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:12,834
I would really love it if you did.

1632
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:15,170
- You're singing it.
ELISE: - Come on.

1633
01:10:15,337 --> 01:10:16,588
You should've lied.
You should've said that you heard it

1634
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:17,923
and that you liked it a lot.

1635
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:19,758
I probably should have.

1636
01:10:19,925 --> 01:10:21,843
You definitely should have
'cause then I wouldn't have to do this.

1696
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:01,664
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.

1697
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:22,310
(Cully yelling)
That's for you, Mary!

1698
01:15:22,477 --> 01:15:25,104
Yeah! Shots!

1699
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:32,987
- So that's your big hit song?
- That's my big hit song.

1700
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:40,912
I didn't know you remembered
anything about me,

1701
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:43,456
let alone could write
a song about me.

1702
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:45,708
Really?

1703
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:51,673
Well, there was that...
moment in the parking lot.

1704
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:54,008
- The parking lot, yeah.
- After that basketball game.

1705
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:55,843
Yeah, there was that moment.

1706
01:15:56,928 --> 01:15:59,472
I got scared.
I had my boyfriend.

1707
01:15:59,639 --> 01:16:01,849
Boyfriend in Austin.

1708
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:04,018
Now you have
a boyfriend in Chicago.

1709
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:06,771
Yeah.

1710
01:16:11,943 --> 01:16:13,736
(sighs)

1711
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,575
I should go.

1712
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:22,495
Getting scared again?

1713
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:24,747
- Little bit.
- I'll walk you out.

1714
01:16:29,419 --> 01:16:31,087
MARTY: Hey, Anna.
Should we wait outside?

1715
01:16:34,465 --> 01:16:35,925
(mumbling)

1716
01:16:40,847 --> 01:16:43,099
You guys are 28 years old.
Do you remember that?

1717
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,436
Sorry.

1718
01:16:46,603 --> 01:16:49,105
Is that what you do in New York now?
Wrap people's houses?

1719
01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:50,815
- No.
- Is that how you roll now, Marty?

1720
01:16:50,982 --> 01:16:52,984
- I don't...
- I know this is hard to believe,

1721
01:16:53,151 --> 01:16:56,321
but a couple of hours ago,
it seemed like a great idea.

1722
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:57,822
It did. I was there.
It really...

1723
01:16:57,989 --> 01:16:59,282
You guys are gonna
clean all this up.

1724
01:16:59,449 --> 01:17:00,700
- Of course, yeah.
- All of it.

1725
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:03,119
Absolutely. Every ply.
Every last little...

1726
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:04,787
- We should probably...
- We could start now.

1727
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:07,248
'Cause we got plenty of time
before our flight.

1728
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:10,335
Well, come in.
You're letting all the cold air in.

1729
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,420
Are you sure? We...

1730
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:16,633
- Thank you.
AJ: - So sorry again.

1731
01:17:18,343 --> 01:17:20,845
So, does your mom still live here?

1732
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:24,515
I hope we didn't wake her up.
We tried to be quiet.

1733
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:26,643
- She's a deep sleeper.
MARTY: - Okay.

1734
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:28,102
AJ:
Cool.

1735
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:32,482
- It's nice... it's cool you're still...
BOY: - Mommy, you awake?

1736
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:35,860
Oh.
Was that a...

1737
01:17:39,781 --> 01:17:42,158
Last call, people.
Last call.

1738
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:45,536
One more drink
and then the party is over.

1739
01:17:45,703 --> 01:17:47,288
SCOTT: Peter, what do you want?
Last customer.

1740
01:17:47,455 --> 01:17:50,249
- Vodka cranberry.
- Yeah.

1741
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:58,675
- You have fun tonight?
CULLY: - Yeah, it was pretty good.

1742
01:18:00,218 --> 01:18:02,929
Yeah, it was fine.

1743
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:09,477
- Scotty?
- Yeah, baby.

1744
01:18:09,644 --> 01:18:11,562
Look who's ready to have fun.

1745
01:18:11,729 --> 01:18:13,398
- Shots.
- Shots.

1746
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:15,400
Shots. Three shots.

1747
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:17,568
- Let's do it.
- You, me, Jerry. Let's do it.

1748
01:18:17,735 --> 01:18:21,489
Barkeep, Jerry,
let's go for it.

1749
01:18:21,656 --> 01:18:23,908
- You're driving.
- Who says I'm driving?

1750
01:18:27,412 --> 01:18:29,622
You want me to drive?
All right.

1751
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:33,584
Unbelievable.

1752
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:36,421
You're not the only one that
can get drunk, you know?

1753
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:38,756
Maybe there are some other people
at the bar

1754
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:41,426
that would like to throw back
some drinks and, you know,

1755
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:44,637
act like an asshole
and sing bad karaoke.

1756
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:49,142
You thought my karaoke was bad?

1757
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:51,519
Porter, come on, man. Are you
gonna take these shots with me or what?

1758
01:18:52,854 --> 01:18:54,856
So here's to you.

1759
01:18:55,022 --> 01:18:57,817
To my husband and your great night
and to us being the same age.

1760
01:18:57,984 --> 01:18:59,110
Cheers.

1761
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:03,698
Oh, my God.

1762
01:19:04,699 --> 01:19:06,117
You Okay?

1763
01:19:07,118 --> 01:19:08,369
What was that?

1764
01:19:08,536 --> 01:19:10,580
- It's whiskey. You want another one?
- No.

1765
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:16,043
Like you said, here's to me.

1766
01:19:18,463 --> 01:19:20,173
SCOTT:
Sorry, Sam.

1767
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:27,430
SAM: So much for that being fun,
huh, Jerry?

1768
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:32,393
Peter?

1769
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,228
We gotta talk.

1770
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:35,938
Come here, dude.

1771
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:38,983
Come on.
We're buddies now.

1772
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:41,527
- Oh, my God.
- I'm not a douche any more.

1773
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:43,905
(Chuckles)

1774
01:19:45,782 --> 01:19:48,242
Well, I guess that's...

1775
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:50,495
that's probably time.

1776
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:51,913
Yeah.

1777
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:54,499
I think that's it.

1778
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:00,338
Are you good?

1779
01:20:00,505 --> 01:20:02,006
Are you good to get home?

1780
01:20:02,173 --> 01:20:03,925
Yeah. Sober.

1781
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:07,178
MARY:
You?

1782
01:20:07,345 --> 01:20:09,430
Uh, yeah.
I'm gonna figure it out.

1783
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:12,642
Okay.

1784
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:19,357
Come on, I'll walk you out.

1785
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,443
Um...

1786
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:24,195
I'm right behind you.

1787
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:27,323
Okay.

1788
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:36,707
- Hey, Jake?
- Yeah?

1789
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:41,921
I think you owe me a dance.

1790
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:50,221
Prom king.

1791
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:55,393
I owe you a dance?
Really?

1792
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:58,563
I want to dance.

1793
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,486
BOY: -Mommy?
ANNA: - I'll be right there, sweetie.

1794
01:21:05,653 --> 01:21:07,280
BOY: Okay.

1795
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:08,948
(whispering)

1796
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:11,242
(door closes)

1797
01:21:12,535 --> 01:21:14,495
(toy squeaks)

1798
01:21:15,705 --> 01:21:19,250
Hey... I didn't even know
you had a child.

1799
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:24,338
MARTY:
Or children.

1800
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:28,718
I know.
It's because I didn't tell you.

1801
01:21:30,344 --> 01:21:32,096
You want some milk?

1802
01:21:32,263 --> 01:21:33,931
You want some milk, baby?

1803
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:36,642
(Cries)
- I know, I know.

1804
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,856
So you have just the two little

1805
01:21:42,023 --> 01:21:44,650
whippersnappers or...

1806
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:48,279
We should...

1807
01:21:48,446 --> 01:21:49,780
Hey, I think...

1808
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:53,784
- Urn, where's-
- We're so sorry, Anna.

1809
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:56,913
- So where's the dad, or is he...
AJ: - Marty.

1810
01:21:58,497 --> 01:21:59,707
Which one?

1811
01:21:59,874 --> 01:22:01,792
Which one do you
want to know about, Marty?

1812
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:04,253
The dad who made...
who helped you make...

1813
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:05,922
Shh.
That's not...

1814
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:08,549
MARTY:
Are they two separate guys?

1815
01:22:08,716 --> 01:22:10,134
Yeah, Jack's dad, we met...

1816
01:22:10,301 --> 01:22:12,887
I was cocktail waitressing
at a bar in college

1817
01:22:13,054 --> 01:22:15,014
and he moved to...

1818
01:22:15,181 --> 01:22:17,266
(sighs)

1819
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:20,394
Atlanta, I think.
Yeah.

1820
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:23,189
And, well, Molly's dad...

1821
01:22:25,066 --> 01:22:27,068
I don't even know
where to start.

1822
01:22:28,486 --> 01:22:29,820
- You don't have to...
- Look...

1823
01:22:29,987 --> 01:22:32,990
this wasn't the plan.

1824
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,954
I know you guys moved off
and became really successful.

1825
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:42,416
And you're staring at me...
looking at me like...

1826
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:45,211
But...

1827
01:22:47,755 --> 01:22:49,382
I mean, I...

1828
01:22:49,548 --> 01:22:53,386
those pictures of me
in high school.

1829
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:55,846
I... and, no.

1830
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:59,976
It's what you said,
about that glow.

1831
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:05,523
(Sobs) I had it.

1832
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:09,151
And I miss it.

1833
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:14,073
And I just thought
for like, one night,

1834
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,951
I could give it a fucking...

1835
01:23:17,118 --> 01:23:18,703
And then you guys come
and you ruin it.

1836
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:21,247
You completely fucked it up.

1837
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:26,043
(Chair rumbles)

1838
01:23:33,384 --> 01:23:35,386
I have a single bed.

1839
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:39,557
I just have a little single bed.
A tiny little bed.

1840
01:23:40,558 --> 01:23:44,145
I have a 200-square-foot apartment
because New York is so expensive,

1841
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:45,730
I can't afford anything more.

1842
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:47,398
I don't even have a separate room
for my toilet.

1843
01:23:47,565 --> 01:23:49,316
It's just all in one room.

1844
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:52,361
And I wanted to get a double bed,
but then I wouldn't have had room

1845
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:54,905
for a partition around the toilet.
It would have just been

1846
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:56,574
a bed and a toilet,

1847
01:23:56,741 --> 01:24:00,286
and then the living room
and the kitchen is all the same,

1848
01:24:00,453 --> 01:24:02,955
so I'd literally be shitting
where I eat.

1849
01:24:03,122 --> 01:24:05,916
So, you know?

1850
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:08,169
(stammers) I...

1851
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:09,587
AJ:
My wife's leaving me.

1852
01:24:09,754 --> 01:24:12,256
ANNA: - What?
- What?

1853
01:24:12,423 --> 01:24:13,758
Mm.

1854
01:24:14,759 --> 01:24:16,427
MARTY:
Are you serious?

1855
01:24:16,594 --> 01:24:19,430
Yeah, I keep screwing up
and she's getting sick of it.

1856
01:24:19,597 --> 01:24:21,432
Or she keeps screwing up
and I'm getting sick of it.

1857
01:24:21,599 --> 01:24:25,561
- It's...
- Why wouldn't you tell me that?

1858
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:29,732
There hasn't been a right time.

1859
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:32,526
What do you mean, the right time?
Are you kidding?

1860
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:34,278
I was best man at your wedding.

1861
01:24:34,445 --> 01:24:36,572
Who else are you
gonna talk to about it?

1862
01:24:36,739 --> 01:24:40,659
No one. No one.
No, I'm saying we all have messes.

1863
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:42,495
It's...

1864
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:44,455
We all have messes.

1865
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:49,502
I have a tiny bed,
you guys have... it's all relative.

1866
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:53,130
(Door opens)
- Oh.

1867
01:24:56,842 --> 01:24:59,637
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, big guy.

1868
01:25:00,638 --> 01:25:01,764
- Mommy?
- Yeah?

1869
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:02,973
I'm hungry.

1870
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:04,975
Okay, sweetheart.

1871
01:25:05,142 --> 01:25:07,394
- Let me see what...
- You're hungry? I'm also hungry.

1872
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:11,065
Oh, this is... I'm the mayor of
Hungrytown right now.

1873
01:25:11,232 --> 01:25:13,692
AJ: We're a bunch of
hungry, hungry hippos.

1874
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:16,362
Hungry hippos here.
So we're with you.

1875
01:25:16,529 --> 01:25:18,823
AJ:
We're totally with you, big man.

1876
01:25:19,824 --> 01:25:21,200
Big night.

1877
01:25:21,367 --> 01:25:22,368
Big night for Jules.

1878
01:25:22,535 --> 01:25:23,911
- I need French fries.
- Yeah, you do.

1879
01:25:24,078 --> 01:25:26,080
- Like, now.
- All kinds of French fries.

1880
01:25:26,247 --> 01:25:28,207
We need to go eat.
I'm starving.

1881
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:30,876
WOMAN:
Is anything open?

1882
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:33,045
- Night, guys.
- Night, Sam.

1883
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:43,931
Hey.
Let's go.

1884
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:46,809
Wake up.

1885
01:25:48,519 --> 01:25:51,689
Hey.
You Okay?

1886
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:54,400
No.

1887
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,115
Let's go.

1888
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:06,036
Come on.
You gotta stand up.

1889
01:26:06,203 --> 01:26:08,706
- Can you stand up?
- No.

1890
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:12,877
Come here, come here.

1891
01:26:20,968 --> 01:26:22,761
SAM: Think you're gonna
remember this tomorrow?

1892
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:25,181
Nope.

1893
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:27,933
Okay. Let's get you
cleaned up, then.

1894
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:41,655
(Music plays)

1895
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:52,249
ELISE: - Another parking lot.
REEVES: - Yeah.

1896
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:56,503
Another parking lot.

1897
01:26:58,756 --> 01:27:00,466
So, hey.
Where do you live?

1898
01:27:00,633 --> 01:27:03,052
'Cause I don't think I know
where you actually live.

1899
01:27:03,219 --> 01:27:05,095
I don't really live anywhere.

1900
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:07,473
I live out of a suitcase.

1901
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:13,520
Do you come back here often?

1902
01:27:13,687 --> 01:27:16,941
No.
Almost never.

1903
01:27:19,693 --> 01:27:22,947
Well, I'll just give you
my number.

1904

In case.

1905
01:27:26,492 --> 01:27:28,244
In case you ever do come back.

1906
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:33,123
You could call me,
if you felt like it.

1907
01:27:42,299 --> 01:27:44,301
And doing that
would be a bad idea.

01:31:46,168 --> 01:31:48,170
I'm such an idiot.
I should've... with the water.

1976
01:31:48,337 --> 01:31:50,214
Oh, my God.
How are you so little?

1977
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:52,841
It's 10 weeks, so...

1978
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:56,220
It's little.

1979
01:31:56,386 --> 01:31:58,347
Oh, my God.
I'm...

1980
01:31:58,514 --> 01:32:00,390
It's a little scary.

1981
01:32:00,557 --> 01:32:02,809
Don't be scared.

1982
01:32:02,976 --> 01:32:04,394
You hear me?
Do not be scared.

1983
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:08,065
You are going to be
just like your dad.

1984
01:32:08,232 --> 01:32:11,193
You're gonna be
the absolute best parent

1985
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,529
that anyone could ever ask for.

1986
01:32:16,156 --> 01:32:17,866
No, don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't.

1987
01:32:18,867 --> 01:32:20,994

WOMAN ON TV:
It has a digital readout.

01:32:50,941 --> 01:32:53,694
Oh, that's so unique.
It comes with a battery.

1998
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:57,155
That is so generous.
A one-year warranty.

1999
01:32:57,322 --> 01:32:59,366
Ever since I had a baby,
I have had...

2000
01:32:59,533 --> 01:33:01,743
You waited up for me?

2001
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:03,704
Yeah.

2002
01:33:07,165 --> 01:33:08,500
Thank you.

2003
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:10,669
For waiting up for you?

2004
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:13,130
No.

2005
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:17,926
For making me stay.

2006
01:33:21,263 --> 01:33:23,599
I don't know.
I just needed to, like...

2007
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:26,351
I needed to see
that she was okay, whatever.

2008
01:33:26,518 --> 01:33:28,604
I know.

2009
01:33:30,439 --> 01:33:32,274
Yeah.

2010
01:33:33,567 --> 01:33:36,570
I think you know me
better than I know me.

2011
01:33:36,737 --> 01:33:39,072
I think I do, too.

2012
01:33:42,242 --> 01:33:44,453
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

2013
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:46,496
What am I thinking right now?

2014
01:33:48,582 --> 01:33:52,169
You're thinking
you want some bacon.

2015
01:33:55,505 --> 01:33:57,299
I'm always thinking of bacon,
<i>so</i> that's not fair.

2016
01:33:57,466 --> 01:33:58,675
(laughs)

2017
01:33:58,842 --> 01:34:01,011
JESS: No, you're not tickling
your way out of this.

2018
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:08,226
I caught her staring at him,
like, seven times.

2019
01:34:08,393 --> 01:34:09,603
Oh!

2020
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:11,480
Wowie wow!

We're so glad you're here.

2022
01:34:14,733 --> 01:34:15,817
- Hey.
- No, we had to come back.

2023
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:18,862
I'm glad you came back.
What'd you do, you go clubbing?

2024
01:34:19,029 --> 01:34:20,656
SCOTT: - Sit down.
- Good to see you.

2025
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:22,574
- Take a seat, take a seat.
- Hi!

2026
01:34:27,204 --> 01:34:28,205
- We're going to Japan?
- Yes.

2027
01:34:28,372 --> 01:34:29,956
- You're all gonna go to Japan.

Vanillo, I'm serious.
Just come on.

2042
01:36:11,308 --> 01:36:13,226
NICK: - I'll try to get everybody.
- No... yeah, right.

2043
01:36:13,393 --> 01:36:14,644
You will get everybody.
Just put it back.

2044
01:36:14,811 --> 01:36:16,354
It's just perfect.
I set it up perfectly.

2045
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:17,773
- I'll put it back, I'll put it back.
- Okay, thank you.

2046
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:18,940
- After I do this.
- No, Vanillo!

2047
01:36:19,107 --> 01:36:22,277
Hey, Vanillo. Just hanging out
at your reunion. Hi.

2048
01:36:22,444 --> 01:36:24,154
- What are you doing with this?
NICK: - I don't know.

2049
01:36:24,321 --> 01:36:25,447
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

2050
01:36:25,614 --> 01:36:27,115
You gotta be filming for a reason.

2051
01:36:27,282 --> 01:36:29,534
- What's this for?
NICK: - I don't know.

2052
01:36:29,701 --> 01:36:31,411
It's just for us, realty.
Nobody's gonna see it.

2053
01:36:31,578 --> 01:36:32,954
Who's us?
I don't know who us is.

2054
01:36:33,121 --> 01:36:34,122
So are you having
a good time here?

2055
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:36,124
Yeah, are you having...
who are you?

2056
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:38,752
- I'm Vanillo. Nick.
- Oh.

2057
01:36:38,919 --> 01:36:41,713
Hi, Vanillo.
How's it going?

2058
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:43,298
It's good to see you again.

2059
01:36:43,465 --> 01:36:44,466
NICK:
It's good to see you, buddy.

2060
01:36:44,633 --> 01:36:46,176
- Remember Peter Chang?
- That's really bright.

2061
01:36:46,343 --> 01:36:48,261
- Yeah, I do.
- Jung. It's Peter Jung.

2062
01:36:48,428 --> 01:36:49,429
- It's Jung.
- I know,

2063
01:36:49,596 --> 01:36:51,056
but no one remembers
you by that.

2064
01:36:51,223 --> 01:36:53,391
- Peter Jung, remember?
NICK: - Yeah, yeah.

2065
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:55,227
- I'm putting him in a car.
- Yeah.

2066
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:56,561
CULLY:
The night is young.

2067
01:36:56,728 --> 01:36:59,314
NICK: Would you say
the night is Peter Jung?

2068
01:36:59,481 --> 01:37:00,816
(laughing)

2069
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:04,820
Oh, my God. I spilled.

2070
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:07,364
The night is Peter Jung.

2071
01:37:07,531 --> 01:37:09,241
You know, the night is Chang.

2072
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:11,493
It's good to be back, see everybody.

2073
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:12,869
See Anna.

2074
01:37:13,036 --> 01:37:14,079
Whoo. What?

2075
01:37:14,246 --> 01:37:15,831
Does your mom have big boobs?

2076
01:37:15,997 --> 01:37:16,998
Whoo, she looks so good.

2077
01:37:17,165 --> 01:37:19,626
She looks really... she almost looks
better than she did in high school.

2078
01:37:19,793 --> 01:37:23,672
She's got a little bit
of late twenties heft.

2079
01:37:23,839 --> 01:37:26,132
Like her body's yearning
to have a baby.

2080
01:37:26,299 --> 01:37:28,760
It's funny seeing Scotty P.

2081
01:37:28,927 --> 01:37:29,970
What is this, smashing?

2082
01:37:30,136 --> 01:37:32,514
- Uh...
- What... what was smashing?

2083
01:37:32,681 --> 01:37:34,724
NICK: Yeah, Scott.
What is smashing?

2084
01:37:34,891 --> 01:37:36,518
Really, Nick? Really?

2085
01:37:36,685 --> 01:37:38,937
You know, Kev Garrity...

2086
01:37:39,104 --> 01:37:40,313
you know, G-Money?

2087
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:44,234
We're just smashing
every minute we can get.

2088
01:37:44,401 --> 01:37:47,195
And then, hopefully,
out of the smash session,

2089
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:50,907
a baby will just smash out of

2090
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:54,119
him and me and then I'll smash
that baby out of the womb.

2091
01:37:54,286 --> 01:37:55,429
And then my baby
will learn how to smash.

2092
01:37:55,495 --> 01:37:56,496
NICK:
That's good.

2093
01:37:56,663 --> 01:37:58,582
It's crazy, man.
It's crazy seeing everybody.

2094
01:37:58,748 --> 01:38:00,250
All the stuff that
we used to do together.

2095
01:38:00,417 --> 01:38:02,127
All the chicks we used to run.
What?

2096
01:38:02,294 --> 01:38:03,600
- We should go in the stall.
- Don't tell Jake.

2097
01:38:03,712 --> 01:38:05,005
- Let's go in the stall.
- Don't tell Jake.

2098
01:38:06,715 --> 01:38:09,718
- Everybody in the stall.
NICK: - Yeah, everybody in the stall.

2099
01:38:09,885 --> 01:38:12,387
SAM: - That's amazing.
- Actually, it's totally changed my...

2100
01:38:12,554 --> 01:38:14,556
I actually never did this
in high school, ever.

2101
01:38:14,723 --> 01:38:16,725
- So this is kind of, like...
(toilet flushes)

2102
01:38:16,892 --> 01:38:19,686
- Oh!
(yelling, laughing)

2103
01:38:19,853 --> 01:38:21,077
- I'm Millie... I'm Millie.
- You remixed...

2104
01:38:21,187 --> 01:38:22,188
- Yeah.
- You remixed my song?

2105
01:38:22,355 --> 01:38:24,482
You know, I mean?
I just do music on the side.

2106
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:27,027
- Which songs did you?
- ♪ The best I never had... ♪

2107
01:38:27,193 --> 01:38:28,236
You know what I mean?

2108
01:38:28,403 --> 01:38:29,779
But look how sexy this is.

2109
01:38:29,946 --> 01:38:31,531
Whose boy band picture is this?

2110
01:38:31,698 --> 01:38:33,325
That's Scott.

2111
01:38:33,491 --> 01:38:35,076
- Scott, of course.
- That's Scott.

2112
01:38:35,243 --> 01:38:37,078
(Imitating electric guitar)

2113
01:38:40,916 --> 01:38:43,126
MAN: - Scott, man.
- That's all I got! That's all I got!

2114
01:38:43,293 --> 01:38:45,545
Well, you are, kinda. 'Cause you
kinda grabbed mine in the bathroom.

2115
01:38:45,712 --> 01:38:47,255
She'd just got 'em.

2116
01:38:47,422 --> 01:38:49,758
Look, I remember you
in tenth grade.

2117
01:38:49,925 --> 01:38:53,678
- Those roses looked like, flat.
- That was junior year.

2118
01:38:53,845 --> 01:38:56,264
And then, in junior and senior year,

2119
01:38:56,431 --> 01:38:57,933
those roses
looked like blossoms.

2120
01:38:58,099 --> 01:38:59,434
Well, I was a late bloomer.

2121
01:38:59,601 --> 01:39:02,020
They're still talking about my boobs.
I'm sorry.

2122
01:39:02,187 --> 01:39:04,606
All right, picture me
as a big old Hershey Kiss.

2123
01:39:04,773 --> 01:39:05,899
Done.

2124
01:39:06,066 --> 01:39:07,442
For a little while.
That's why I just...

2125
01:39:07,609 --> 01:39:09,235
- Excuse us.
NICK: - Sorry about that.

2126
01:39:09,402 --> 01:39:10,570
That's your husband?

2127
