1
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:21,633
I think,
always been good with words.

2
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:27,143
In my work is just as important,
to describe what I do,

3
00:01:27,143 --> 00:01:29,560
as to do what I do.

4
00:01:29,972 --> 00:01:33,458
When what to say,
what words to choose.

5
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,361
Some men hate certain statements.

6
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:42,475
They can not stand certain movements
and can not do without some other.

7
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:47,063
It is part of my work,
to know where I should place my hand.

8
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:52,550
My lips, my tongue, my leg

9
00:01:53,543 --> 00:01:55,879
even my thoughts.

10
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:01,880
How much pressure, how long, when to stop.

11
00:02:05,624 --> 00:02:07,921
I can be your first kiss.

12
00:02:09,953 --> 00:02:14,154
Or a torn out picture from a Playboy,
you found your ninth.

13
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,704
I am your secretary,
or am I your daughter.

14
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:24,080
Maybe I'm your math teacher
from the seventh grade, you always hated.

15
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,820
I know that if I do well,

16
00:02:27,854 --> 00:02:33,105
I am your living, breathing dream can be.

17
00:02:33,138 --> 00:02:37,943
and then I can disappear.

18
00:02:43,638 --> 00:02:44,934
Dr. Stewart?

19
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:50,610
Your last appointment is waiting.
- Okay, thank you Julie.

20
00:02:53,952 --> 00:02:55,693
When was your first period?

21
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:00,357
On my fourteenth.
- And what is your profession?

22
00:03:00,357 --> 00:03:03,418
I am a dancer.
- Oh yes, what kind of dancer?

23
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:05,456
Classical ballet.

24
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:08,526
Do you use contraception?

25
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:12,576
And would like a baby?
- No, definitely not, no.

26
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:14,636
Do you work on safe sex?

27
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,565
I've never had an orgasm.

28
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,068
You have ever slept with someone?

29
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:26,124
We are ready, thank you.

30
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:33,681
I have so far rarely had sex.
There is something that I do not understand.

31
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:39,007
An orgasm is simply
the contraction of certain muscles.

32
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:44,934
This is by manipulating the clitoris.
There is no mystery or magic about it.

33
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:47,676
I give you some literature about it, okay?

34
00:03:48,515 --> 00:03:50,117
You may get dressed.

35
00:03:55,294 --> 00:04:00,052
And this is the second scene in which Leporello
Giovanni's conquests opnoemt Thurs.

36
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:04,303
By country, by age, per figure.

37
00:04:04,303 --> 00:04:07,667
Is she nice or mean,
a woman or a princess,

38
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,648
single or married,

39
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:13,150
eventually he says, it does not matter,
but if they wear skirts.

40
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:17,723
If we look at the title of this aria,
which is called...?

41
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:22,158
U.
- Madamina, il catalogo и questo.

42
00:04:22,158 --> 00:04:25,002
What does he mean?
- Sir?

43
00:04:25,002 --> 00:04:28,750
In Italy, 640, 231 in Germany,

44
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,206
Spain in 1003.

45
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:35,468
Beloved, that Don Giovanni alone
Spain conquered.

46
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:37,450
A very busy man.

47
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,574
A few of us would ask you to eat,
you have time?

48
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,835
I would like,
I am honored, but...

49
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:53,915
Today is my birthday
and a half hours I fly home.

50
00:05:07,134 --> 00:05:11,239
Hello, how are you,
have you anything to drink?

51
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:13,692
Gifts to my office, okay?

52
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:17,895
You understand that I should murder,
if you would do this to me.

53
00:05:17,895 --> 00:05:19,701
You're a very courageous wife.

54
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:22,356
I've changed my clothes 25 times,
is it good?

55
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,683
You look great.
- What time is it?

56
00:05:24,683 --> 00:05:28,529
He has landed 40 minutes ago, so so.

57
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:30,846
Please.
- Thank you.

58
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:38,662
Michael, your dad is so,
Come with us.

59
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:47,221
Where is that boy stayed
in his mother's arms flew.

60
00:05:47,255 --> 00:05:49,874
His girlfriend takes him down to graze
at this time.

61
00:05:49,907 --> 00:05:52,181
That is terrible,
against a mother to say.

62
00:05:52,215 --> 00:05:55,420
He does a lot better.
- Yes, that's right.

63
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:58,268
Trina, This is Catherine.

64
00:05:58,268 --> 00:06:02,206
Our hostess and my colleagues in practice.
- Hi, nice.

65
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:04,420
What you have a beautiful home.
- Thank you.

66
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:07,789
That will be him.
Quiet everybody.

67
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:22,804
Hello darling, are you home?
- I'm a little late.

68
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:26,133
The airline said,
that your plane has landed.

69
00:06:26,215 --> 00:06:28,539
I've just missed him.

70
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:32,347
And you said,
you could not pick me, so...

71
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:36,280
You know when you get home?

72
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:42,639
The next flight leaves in two hours,
You probably already asleep when I get back.

73
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:44,956
I am sorry

74
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,142
Catherine, dear.

75
00:06:50,188 --> 00:06:52,149
Then we see each other when you return.

76
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:04,783
It seems that we who are surprised,
He has missed his flight.

77
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:09,419
Then we charter a plane
and we surprised him.

78
00:07:10,993 --> 00:07:16,732
This was not part of the plan,
but that's no reason to stop, do you?

79
00:08:05,815 --> 00:08:09,287
Michael, your girlfriend should go home
it's getting late.

80
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:06,294
I am sorry
- I had to tell you.

81
00:09:06,294 --> 00:09:08,410
Yes, that's what you should do.

82
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,728
But it was no surprise been.

83
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:15,150
At my age, I try my birthdays
to ignore, it's so damn...

84
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:17,123
embarrassing?

85
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:24,398
The gifts are in my office,
The bottle of Scotch is mine.

86
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:29,667
I'm late again tonight,
a boring curriculum meeting.

87
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:33,303
Yes, but now you're not late.
- I'll go have a coffee.

88
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,280
Good morning.

89
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:10,784
Michael,
your mom is in the hall and she saw me naked.

90
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:14,913
Jesus Michael, this is not good.

91
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:18,582
I just came.
- You're lying.

92
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:21,175
I better go home.

93
00:10:22,313 --> 00:10:26,282
Dad knows.
- Your father knows here?

94
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:29,172
It was all night in my house
and nobody tells me anything?

95
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:32,548
Anna, her name is Anna.

96
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:37,835
Do you use for contraception?
- We use condoms.

97
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:42,294
This does not happen every night,

98
00:10:43,457 --> 00:10:44,957
Understand?

99
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:08,916
"Thanks for last night
Miranda.

100
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,920
See you guys later.
- Hey sweetheart, days.

101
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,397
Over here.

102
00:12:05,668 --> 00:12:07,109
Hello.

103
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,910
Do your hair differently?
- Yes, David has not even noticed.

104
00:12:09,943 --> 00:12:12,263
Because he has long preferred.
- How do you know?

105
00:12:12,263 --> 00:12:14,565
That's what all men,
they imagine that their...

106
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:18,024
Frank that's enough.
- Sit down.

107
00:12:18,024 --> 00:12:19,844
Sorry honey.

108
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:23,535
Hi David.
- Hello Frank.

109
00:12:25,341 --> 00:12:29,077
I Dehlia, your waitress tonight,
what can I bring you a drink?

110
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:32,919
What would you like to drink Dehlia?
- I?

111
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:39,324
I like the Maybach Vineyard
with a deep intense pure flavor.

112
00:12:40,444 --> 00:12:43,266
Then we take it.

113
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:45,353
A good choice.
- And you?

114
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:46,980
The same love.

115
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,153
Where is the toilet?
Frank?

116
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,424
Oh, there.

117
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:31,786
Is everything okay?
- Yes, everything is fine, thank you

118
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:36,566
Can I help you?

119
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:44,224
There is no toilet paper.
- Here's something.

120
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:51,294
Please.

121
00:13:54,745 --> 00:13:58,962
Men are assholes.
- Yes.

122
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,757
Thank you.
- No thanks.

123
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:30,012
I think you've dropped.

124
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,418
That is not mine.

125
00:14:34,768 --> 00:14:36,829
Take it anyway.

126
00:14:38,852 --> 00:14:40,270
Why?

127
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:46,112
I want you to have it.

128
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,574
I must return to my husband.

129
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,654
Frank has discovered a whore.
- Great.

130
00:15:09,436 --> 00:15:13,853
This is a nice hotel with lots of horny
and wealthy businessmen from outside,

131
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:15,829
This is a sexy situation.

132
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,620
They mingle among the ordinary people.
- They are normal people.

133
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,987
I do not know how normal they are.
- Have you ever had d'r?

134
00:15:24,987 --> 00:15:28,542
I?
- What do I do.

135
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,366
It's not a habit.

136
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:36,485
I like to pay.
- Stop it.

137
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:39,871
If you have some dusting and want to be purged
without emotional consequences

138
00:15:40,495 --> 00:15:44,855
To prevent rejection and women
sitting behind you, then you pay for it.

139
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:06,126
Loved that sexy waitress?
- What?

140
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:10,976
That you're flirting.
- Come on, I was just friendly.

141
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,776
The people are always so rude
against the staff.

142
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:17,869
And then you're extra nice,
to make it good.

143
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:26,471
Got to run to get the plane?
- What?

144
00:16:26,471 --> 00:16:29,760
You said you just missed him,
so you should have run.

145
00:16:29,794 --> 00:16:32,058
It was close a few minutes.

146
00:16:33,814 --> 00:16:36,552
Did you intentionally missed the flight?

147
00:16:36,585 --> 00:16:40,083
What does it matter whether I accidentally,
or intentionally missed.

148
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:43,169
Because you said it was accidental,
and your birthday was.

149
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:44,624
A birthday surprise.

150
00:16:44,658 --> 00:16:47,988
It was not intentional and not accidental,
it just happened.

151
00:16:48,022 --> 00:16:49,903
Are you being a little drink?

152
00:18:24,706 --> 00:18:26,959
What would you drink?
; - A glass of Chardonnay please.

153
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,617
Of course.

154
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,738
Give me something to drink?

155
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,919
What do you want?

156
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:47,943
What do you drink?

157
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:52,281
Please.
- Another chardonnay for her, please.

158
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,262
I normally do not more women.

159
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:04,713
Couples, but...

160
00:19:05,638 --> 00:19:07,906
women only...

161
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,043
Thank you.

162
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:15,977
I think my husband you should.

163
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:19,064
Looking for his wife before him?

164
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,673
Can not he come?

165
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:25,620
Why not?

166
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,239
What's your name?

167
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,753
My husband cheating on me.

168
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:42,965
At least I think so.

169
00:19:46,931 --> 00:19:55,482
I want to know what he does,
if you present yourself to him.

170
00:19:57,786 --> 00:20:00,229
Most of my clients are married.

171
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:03,383
He is not a customer.

172
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,583
How does he look like?

173
00:20:14,622 --> 00:20:16,375
He is big,

174
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:20,986
strong, he has brown hair.

175
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:23,916
He is very handsome.

176
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:30,137
David lunch usually
in the Cafй Diplomatico.

177
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,965
He usually reads the newspaper.

178
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:37,895
If he asks what I do for work,
what do you want me to say?

179
00:20:37,928 --> 00:20:41,897
Say you are a student
studying and interpreting.

180
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:45,568
Do you speak other languages?
- A little Japanese.

181
00:20:45,568 --> 00:20:47,256
Okay.

182
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:54,479
Excuse me.

183
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:58,930
Sorry, can I borrow your sugar?
- Of course.

184
00:20:59,704 --> 00:21:01,227
Thank you.

185
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:47,097
Recognized not you take me?

186
00:21:48,862 --> 00:21:50,804
I was not sure.

187
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:04,580
I met him.

188
00:22:05,918 --> 00:22:11,274
Like you said, he read the newspaper
and I'm going to ask him sugar.

189
00:22:11,615 --> 00:22:15,087
And he pretended to read the newspaper and...

190
00:22:15,942 --> 00:22:20,977
He stood up and came towards me
and asked if I was a student

191
00:22:21,011 --> 00:22:24,809
and I said I studied languages,
like you said, Japanese.

192
00:22:26,477 --> 00:22:29,881
And he said,
or I could say something in Japanese,

193
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,894
so I blushed

194
00:22:31,927 --> 00:22:35,249
and I said;
'Konnichiwa'

195
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,030
And then he asked my name
and I said Chloe.

196
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,448
Well, that's okay.

197
00:22:46,874 --> 00:22:50,768
Nothing happened.
- Except that he appealed to you.

198
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:52,897
A beautiful girl in a cafe.

199
00:22:52,897 --> 00:22:56,106
He flirted scarcely
He was just friendly.

200
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,281
He's cute.

201
00:23:09,563 --> 00:23:11,254
How can you do this?

202
00:23:24,758 --> 00:23:27,344
I try to find something fun everyone.

203
00:23:28,752 --> 00:23:31,043
If only something small.

204
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:36,153
How someone smiles.

205
00:23:38,323 --> 00:23:41,928
There's always something,
it should be.

206
00:23:44,452 --> 00:23:48,603
I try to be generous
and I do things I do not want to do.

207
00:23:50,225 --> 00:23:54,276
I concentrate on things
who do not bother

208
00:23:57,364 --> 00:24:00,715
It happened to me unusual things.
- Like what?

209
00:24:00,715 --> 00:24:02,179
You.

210
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,288
I?

211
00:24:08,243 --> 00:24:11,241
Yes, people like you
who walk into my life.

212
00:24:31,655 --> 00:24:33,372
The money is in the envelope.

213
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:41,541
I want to do it again,
to see what he does.

214
00:24:41,574 --> 00:24:43,781
And then we stop it, okay?

215
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:47,435
Okay.

216
00:25:15,843 --> 00:25:19,488
Listen, we're not engaged or anything, okay?

217
00:25:19,488 --> 00:25:23,341
If other guys are
has nothing to do with you.

218
00:25:24,845 --> 00:25:26,827
I gotta see, this is...

219
00:25:27,469 --> 00:25:30,655
This is strange.
- You see me.

220
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:34,309
I mean personally,
This is all nonsense.

221
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:37,413
We still talk to each other personally,
let's...

222
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:42,199
When people break up,
there must be someone else.

223
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:44,398
I do not think...

224
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:48,761
The exams are coming
and I would not feel bound by you,

225
00:25:48,761 --> 00:25:50,199
or whatever.

226
00:25:54,337 --> 00:25:55,872
Damn it, Mom.

227
00:26:12,174 --> 00:26:15,622
Who are you online?
- With one of my students,

228
00:26:15,622 --> 00:26:17,540
We have just finished anyway.

229
00:26:18,569 --> 00:26:20,616
Our son was dumped.

230
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:23,513
How do you know?

231
00:26:25,158 --> 00:26:28,642
I do not know what bothers me more,
he sleeps on her, or not exactly.

232
00:26:30,385 --> 00:26:34,207
Have you talked to him?
- He is not talking to me.

233
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:39,510
Catherine, this is okay.

234
00:26:39,796 --> 00:26:41,974
I do not know,
how his mother must be.

235
00:26:42,008 --> 00:26:45,158
It'll be all right.
He gets therapy

236
00:26:45,158 --> 00:26:49,417
He...
- Did you know that his girlfriend sleep over?

237
00:26:53,313 --> 00:26:55,563
Come on, you know what it was?

238
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:00,866
Shall we go and test?

239
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:04,068
No, I have a headache.
- Take one tablet.

240
00:27:04,068 --> 00:27:06,960
I already did.
- Take two.

241
00:27:20,408 --> 00:27:23,270
Nectar Oh, here.

242
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:28,583
Thank you for the Scotch

243
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:31,905
and thank you for the small party.

244
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:40,718
I love your smile.
- That's not true.

245
00:27:45,318 --> 00:27:49,129
Why do not we get more
from the airport?

246
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,246
No idea.

247
00:27:53,344 --> 00:27:56,651
And together waiting at the gate.

248
00:27:57,741 --> 00:28:01,575
I try to remember
when that happened.

249
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,071
After the tightening of security.
- Really?

250
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:11,337
No idea.
We just got busier and busier.

251
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,703
What?

252
00:28:22,751 --> 00:28:27,208
I still read papers
and correct for tomorrow.

253
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:30,845
Yes, you better get to work.
- Is everything okay?

254
00:28:30,845 --> 00:28:32,536
Yes, of course.

255
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:56,196
Yes Dad, it's rather odd do you know

256
00:28:56,196 --> 00:28:59,416
When Anne and I met was the...

257
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:03,671
I've never felt for someone...

258
00:29:03,671 --> 00:29:07,345
did you feel the same with Mom, Dad?

259
00:29:07,644 --> 00:29:12,556
When you met?
I always asked you to tell that story.

260
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:15,647
That they are the most beautiful woman,
you've ever seen

261
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,312
and that it was all that was not what you...

262
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,111
"Meet me at Rivoli.
Chloe.

263
00:29:59,551 --> 00:30:03,508
There you are.
- Hey, they are great.

264
00:30:05,672 --> 00:30:11,022
I'm sorry, I did think I
a weird phase of uncertainty

265
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:15,292
or a midlife crisis or something,
let us forget.

266
00:30:15,292 --> 00:30:17,423
But I've already done.
- The password?

267
00:30:17,456 --> 00:30:21,306
No, I've already met him.
- You've met him? Where?

268
00:30:21,306 --> 00:30:25,796
I was in the cafe and I approached him,
as you asked and we had lunch.

269
00:30:25,796 --> 00:30:31,440
Wait, you have lunch with my husband?
- Yes, it was kind of a picnic...

270
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,318
We bought sandwiches
and I asked about his teaching.

271
00:30:36,318 --> 00:30:38,779
And he started talking about his music.

272
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,358
And he stared at me.

273
00:30:45,984 --> 00:30:47,656
And then?

274
00:30:50,397 --> 00:30:52,551
Then he asked if he could kiss me.

275
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,856
I have not asked you.

276
00:30:56,191 --> 00:30:59,326
But he said he could not kiss me,
because he is married.

277
00:31:00,756 --> 00:31:03,942
He hesitated at first.
- First...

278
00:31:06,873 --> 00:31:08,421
And then...

279
00:31:09,526 --> 00:31:15,040
he asked where we could kiss
no one would see us and...

280
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:21,349
And I said we at Allan Gardens
could go, the park across the street,

281
00:31:21,383 --> 00:31:24,104
with that big greenhouse.

282
00:31:29,797 --> 00:31:31,860
Should I quit?

283
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:42,948
We walked through those big long corridor
with exotic flowers.

284
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:47,648
There was nobody else.

285
00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:51,069
I love Allan Gardens.

286
00:31:51,751 --> 00:31:56,360
It's always so hot
and the air feels so good to.

287
00:31:57,252 --> 00:31:59,469
It's like suddenly
in another country.

288
00:32:00,817 --> 00:32:04,532
I know there is a back place,
where they store equipment.

289
00:32:05,468 --> 00:32:07,831
There is no one.

290
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,897
It's like a secret hiding place.

291
00:32:12,091 --> 00:32:16,807
He brought his mouth to my lips,
We have stayed quite long.

292
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,476
I could feel his excitement through his pants.
- That's enough.

293
00:32:30,084 --> 00:32:35,389
You had to take my husband,
and see what he was doing and then report.

294
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,209
I do not know what you want.

295
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,705
I told you not to be involved,
I made a mistake.

296
00:33:06,368 --> 00:33:10,875
I'm sorry, I wanted to pull away,
all is well with your bumper?

297
00:33:12,377 --> 00:33:15,162
I'm sorry, you just move forward?

298
00:33:35,607 --> 00:33:37,909
Did you this bag around with you in the car?

299
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:40,805
You never know when you need it.

300
00:33:41,707 --> 00:33:43,903
Let him not destroy cut.

301
00:33:43,903 --> 00:33:47,526
I put him off.

302
00:34:00,462 --> 00:34:03,474
Hold this, it stops the bleeding.

303
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:14,513
I am sorry

304
00:34:22,438 --> 00:34:27,545
Is that a scar?
- No, I do not expect.

305
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:44,828
We were deep in the forest
of exotic plants and trees.

306
00:34:46,814 --> 00:34:52,015
And we heard voices in the distance,
but we were confident that nobody could see us.

307
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:57,187
And I pushed with my hand in his pants
and felt him.

308
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:11,131
And then I moved my hand up and down.

309
00:35:17,205 --> 00:35:18,644
Exactly.

310
00:35:22,595 --> 00:35:28,455
And I kept working on my hand
in his pants and...

311
00:35:30,058 --> 00:35:33,494
He said he could not come,
because he had his job.

312
00:35:33,857 --> 00:35:36,255
But I did not stop.

313
00:35:38,348 --> 00:35:40,390
And when I bite his tongue.

314
00:35:43,153 --> 00:35:46,955
And when he finished in my hand.

315
00:35:48,431 --> 00:35:49,874
And then?

316
00:35:49,874 --> 00:35:52,857
Then he had to his work,
and he walked away.

317
00:36:11,456 --> 00:36:13,538
I do not mean to be rude...

318
00:36:15,135 --> 00:36:19,833
I want to be sure that you are healthy.

319
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:21,913
I have a national test.

320
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:27,302
All, including HIV, venereal diseases
and let me see the results.

321
00:36:27,335 --> 00:36:29,417
Okay, yeah.

322
00:38:41,573 --> 00:38:43,031
Can I help you?

323
00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:45,290
I am looking for Catherine.

324
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,463
Dr Stewart now has a patient,
What time did you meet?

325
00:38:47,463 --> 00:38:50,437
I have an appointment, we are friends.

326
00:38:51,227 --> 00:38:53,817
Okay, so they will be coming.

327
00:38:54,627 --> 00:38:57,674
Would you sit?
- Okay.

328
00:39:12,931 --> 00:39:14,274
Hi Michael.

329
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:18,735
Your mother is still in with a patient.
- I just want to pick up my tuxedo.

330
00:39:18,735 --> 00:39:21,510
Who is in her office.
An exciting recital tonight eh?

331
00:39:21,951 --> 00:39:26,733
Yes, I need some music to copy.

332
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:31,733
Dr Stewart's your mom?

333
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:35,909
My mother is your obstetrician?

334
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,159
You look like her.

335
00:40:05,745 --> 00:40:07,183
I?

336
00:40:07,601 --> 00:40:11,786
I think not.
- Yes, you have the same look in your eyes.

337
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:16,913
Not the color or shape, but...

338
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:19,584
The look.

339
00:40:20,993 --> 00:40:22,688
And your lips too.

340
00:40:28,158 --> 00:40:29,783
I'm Chloe Sweeny.

341
00:40:30,073 --> 00:40:34,343
I'm Michael Stewart.
- Nice.

342
00:40:34,343 --> 00:40:36,930
Are you a musician?

343
00:40:37,737 --> 00:40:40,747
No, for me just to hear, I think.

344
00:40:40,747 --> 00:40:42,979
Study music.

345
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:47,789
I wish I had attended.

346
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:50,277
Me love music.

347
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:52,098
Classic?

348
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,776
Raised by Swans.

349
00:40:57,994 --> 00:41:01,072
Do you know the band Raised by Swans not?

350
00:41:03,203 --> 00:41:04,873
You'll find them well.

351
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,787
You'll really like them.

352
00:41:15,749 --> 00:41:17,689
Those were my appointments huh?

353
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:20,815
Manny's motors called,
your car is ready.

354
00:41:20,815 --> 00:41:23,203
Alicia and rang for lunch to two hours.
- Exactly.

355
00:41:23,203 --> 00:41:25,934
And your son is behind the copy.

356
00:41:28,116 --> 00:41:29,637
Hello doctor.

357
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,837
Please, everything complete.

358
00:41:34,968 --> 00:41:37,608
Okay, thank you for bringing long.

359
00:41:38,855 --> 00:41:40,442
Can I talk to you?

360
00:41:40,475 --> 00:41:43,969
No, it does not work, I'm stuck,
when you call...

361
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:49,367
Yes, briefly then.

362
00:41:55,544 --> 00:41:57,382
That's my son.

363
00:41:59,597 --> 00:42:04,017
You did not speak to him?
- I came to tell you about this afternoon.

364
00:42:04,017 --> 00:42:05,863
That's today.

365
00:42:05,897 --> 00:42:10,051
Today?
- Yes, after lunch.

366
00:42:21,155 --> 00:42:22,865
Got my tuxedo?

367
00:42:24,649 --> 00:42:26,158
Thank you.

368
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:29,468
I'm excited.
- Why?

369
00:42:29,468 --> 00:42:33,718
Because tonight, to see you play.
I have a lucky charm in your pocket.

370
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,454
Okay.

371
00:42:37,313 --> 00:42:40,666
Thank you Mom.
- What you said.

372
00:42:47,169 --> 00:42:51,972
She lies every night to propose
she sees her children every week

373
00:42:51,972 --> 00:42:56,212
and she says she can not handle.
- So she stays with him.

374
00:42:56,212 --> 00:42:58,894
She tries to present
just to survive.

375
00:43:15,157 --> 00:43:18,270
"Windsor Arms, room 211.
Chloe.

376
00:43:18,615 --> 00:43:21,430
Who was that?
- A patient.

377
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:24,612
What happened to you on?
- Nothing.

378
00:43:26,386 --> 00:43:30,981
Listen, I understand.
Especially if David will miss flights.

379
00:43:30,981 --> 00:43:35,319
David is okay, we have spoken.
He missed his flight, that's all.

380
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:37,127
He is not the most organized man.

381
00:43:37,127 --> 00:43:40,836
No, I'm talking about you.
- Who did you meet?

382
00:43:40,836 --> 00:43:44,907
I?
No, oh God no.

383
00:43:45,902 --> 00:43:48,430
It is written on your forehead.

384
00:43:49,714 --> 00:43:56,297
Who got pregnant patient in panic,
when a spade or a krampje feel

385
00:43:56,297 --> 00:43:58,786
because she is afraid to become a mother.

386
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:04,043
I have decided to support it.
I have to call back, it's important.

387
00:44:04,076 --> 00:44:06,469
We were done anyway, right?

388
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:10,040
Thanks for lunch,
Goodbye.

389
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,863
No, no.

390
00:45:24,157 --> 00:45:26,301
Go sit in that chair.

391
00:45:35,426 --> 00:45:39,559
Okay, but far.

392
00:45:43,656 --> 00:45:46,416
We met again in the park affected.

393
00:45:47,976 --> 00:45:52,107
This time he did not take sandwiches,
We took this room.

394
00:45:54,297 --> 00:45:58,566
He took the news
and pretended he was interested.

395
00:45:58,566 --> 00:46:00,769
I sat down beside him.

396
00:46:02,178 --> 00:46:07,080
He turned and looked at me
and kissed me.

397
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:10,496
And whispered, let's fuck.

398
00:46:13,571 --> 00:46:15,010
Jesus.

399
00:46:21,685 --> 00:46:23,566
He got him up.

400
00:46:23,938 --> 00:46:26,261
He has tried several times.

401
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:31,214
He was ashamed,
but I said it did not matter.

402
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:36,260
I thought it was good,
because then we could wait a bit.

403
00:46:36,979 --> 00:46:40,582
He was fully dressed
and I completely naked.

404
00:46:48,283 --> 00:46:50,481
Are you excited about here?

405
00:46:55,113 --> 00:47:00,369
He wanted to stay dressed.
He sat on the bench.

406
00:47:04,236 --> 00:47:07,097
I had to come between his legs.

407
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:17,460
I put it in my mouth
and he was stiff.

408
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:25,174
Is everything okay?

409
00:47:27,155 --> 00:47:29,261
I think I know what the members have.

410
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:33,908
Have you been to a doctor?

411
00:47:33,941 --> 00:47:39,028
No, it's nothing,
me take zinc.

412
00:47:42,355 --> 00:47:44,561
He finished in your mouth?

413
00:47:49,371 --> 00:47:52,895
I pulled him out,
did a condom

414
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:56,389
and sat on him.

415
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:05,307
He was almost ready.

416
00:48:05,727 --> 00:48:07,748
After he pushed me inside.

417
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:14,054
I pushed my breasts against his face.

418
00:48:46,146 --> 00:48:48,171
Want tallying?

419
00:48:49,295 --> 00:48:51,075
No, it's okay.

420
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:40,266
That zinc does it?

421
00:49:40,658 --> 00:49:43,072
If you start early with it.

422
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:55,903
What perfume is that?

423
00:49:59,066 --> 00:50:00,391
It is a lotion.

424
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,647
Here.

425
00:50:10,481 --> 00:50:12,556
We always did everything together.

426
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:16,937
We could not prevent
to not be together.

427
00:50:17,203 --> 00:50:19,081
Not even hours.

428
00:50:20,696 --> 00:50:23,209
We wait together,
if the other had an appointment.

429
00:50:23,209 --> 00:50:26,988
We loved the moments of waiting,
because we saw each other again.

430
00:50:27,832 --> 00:50:29,369
Could touch each other.

431
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:32,967
I loved his hands.

432
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:36,087
They took me everywhere.

433
00:50:37,212 --> 00:50:39,385
So it was.

434
00:50:39,785 --> 00:50:42,264
I was younger.

435
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:47,396
Did you ever lived with someone?

436
00:50:55,715 --> 00:50:57,612
Do you still love him?

437
00:51:00,131 --> 00:51:01,610
I do not know.

438
00:51:11,181 --> 00:51:12,957
One more thing.

439
00:51:16,082 --> 00:51:20,406
He said he was doing this for the first time.
- That's a lie.

440
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:28,269
Jesus.

441
00:51:29,381 --> 00:51:32,898
I do not know whether I should have been relieved,
or to go hang myself.

442
00:51:36,404 --> 00:51:37,758
Damn.

443
00:52:07,216 --> 00:52:09,523
I can not.

444
00:53:49,512 --> 00:53:52,227
Congratulations.
- What?

445
00:53:52,866 --> 00:53:54,700
With your wonderful son.

446
00:53:57,902 --> 00:54:02,248
He looks at you.
- No, it looks like you, that you know.

447
00:54:06,135 --> 00:54:09,295
What is that?
Do you wear perfume?

448
00:54:10,856 --> 00:54:13,956
It is a lotion.
- It smells good.

449
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:18,446
Professor Stewart.

450
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:21,485
Madeleine,
how are you?

451
00:55:54,368 --> 00:55:56,033
How does he do it?

452
00:55:56,945 --> 00:55:58,283
What?

453
00:55:58,556 --> 00:56:00,560
You touch them.

454
00:56:02,878 --> 00:56:04,316
Oh God.

455
00:58:12,109 --> 00:58:14,181
But stop here.

456
00:58:16,255 --> 00:58:18,405
Do you live here?

457
00:58:18,472 --> 00:58:21,746
Which house is yours?
- Over there.

458
00:58:23,391 --> 00:58:25,543
This is her journey home.

459
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:32,928
Meet my husband anymore, please.

460
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:39,737
Wait...
I got something for you.

461
00:58:49,982 --> 00:58:54,848
You must take.
- I told you it is yours.

462
00:58:54,848 --> 00:58:57,955
No, this was my mother.

463
00:58:59,049 --> 00:59:00,711
I want you to have.

464
00:59:03,971 --> 00:59:06,113
Did you intentionally drop?

465
00:59:11,624 --> 00:59:13,773
I wanted to talk to you.

466
00:59:19,668 --> 00:59:21,366
I gotta go.

467
00:59:24,104 --> 00:59:25,916
Do you want me not see?

468
00:59:28,674 --> 00:59:34,283
I do not know, we work in the same neighborhood,
we will meet down in the street.

469
00:59:35,545 --> 00:59:39,636
Will you see me in the street?
- So not what I meant-I mean...

470
00:59:40,622 --> 00:59:42,469
that came out wrong.

471
00:59:43,752 --> 00:59:46,275
I am exhausted.

472
01:00:39,192 --> 01:00:40,967
Who is it?

473
01:00:46,056 --> 01:00:47,968
Are you in love?

474
01:00:49,505 --> 01:00:53,648
If so, it makes any difference?
- Of course it makes a difference.

475
01:00:53,648 --> 01:00:55,005
Are you love?

476
01:00:55,005 --> 01:00:56,996
You were the whole night away
and now I am questioned?

477
01:00:56,996 --> 01:01:00,795
Right, I forgot,
you are discreet with your women

478
01:01:00,795 --> 01:01:02,988
You will not leave home.
You know how.

479
01:01:02,988 --> 01:01:05,591
I love women,
I appreciate their beauty, their intelligence,

480
01:01:05,591 --> 01:01:07,145
that does not mean I fuck them.

481
01:01:07,145 --> 01:01:11,966
How do you feel that your office if I
you come in and chat with a student?

482
01:01:11,966 --> 01:01:15,854
I ask myself available to my students,
if I win their confidence, as I teach.

483
01:01:15,854 --> 01:01:18,569
You will not agree to.
- What in?

484
01:01:18,569 --> 01:01:24,786
You flirt with every woman you meet,
may you ever fuck with everybody.

485
01:01:24,819 --> 01:01:27,408
I have no option.
- Stop it.

486
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:32,650
Go to your room.
- Should I go to my room?

487
01:01:32,684 --> 01:01:35,854
Leave us alone.
- You can not order me.

488
01:01:35,854 --> 01:01:37,532
Michael, that's enough.

489
01:01:37,566 --> 01:01:40,058
I can not wait,
here to escape.

490
01:02:22,192 --> 01:02:25,755
I was detained in hospital.
- Is it?

491
01:02:27,085 --> 01:02:28,838
Is it?

492
01:02:29,982 --> 01:02:34,397
There was an urgent call from Mrs. Beatrice
because her hormone treatment.

493
01:02:34,430 --> 01:02:37,446
Mrs. Carmical again has a fungal infection.

494
01:02:40,176 --> 01:02:44,376
And these are just before you come
and there is an urgent e-mail.

495
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:51,539
I'll be there.

496
01:03:02,009 --> 01:03:04,003
Oh my God.

497
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:22,834
Chloe.
- Where are you?

498
01:03:22,834 --> 01:03:26,320
I'm in your waiting room,
you saw me when you came?

499
01:03:35,727 --> 01:03:37,438
Smell.

500
01:03:38,428 --> 01:03:40,264
What are you doing?

501
01:03:41,737 --> 01:03:43,283
I am sorry

502
01:03:51,197 --> 01:03:53,650
I am sorry.

503
01:03:55,637 --> 01:03:57,572
Why?

504
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:03,204
You're amazing.

505
01:04:04,509 --> 01:04:06,801
You are so beautiful.

506
01:04:12,087 --> 01:04:15,483
We're so far gone as I wanted.

507
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:23,523
I liked it.

508
01:04:24,388 --> 01:04:26,132
Yesterday night.

509
01:04:29,174 --> 01:04:31,620
I,
I can not say that it is not.

510
01:04:34,793 --> 01:04:36,769
I would not think it's over.

511
01:04:37,533 --> 01:04:42,611
And I think you will not.
- Do you want money?

512
01:04:45,438 --> 01:04:47,212
This is not about money.

513
01:04:49,683 --> 01:04:53,568
You took money from me,
So since when is not about money?

514
01:05:11,703 --> 01:05:13,895
That should be enough for everything.

515
01:05:20,452 --> 01:05:24,626
This is not business,
this is real and you know it.

516
01:05:25,111 --> 01:05:28,550
And then last night, I got you and...
- How do I do this to make sense?

517
01:05:28,837 --> 01:05:34,262
This business transaction,
what this was, is over.

518
01:05:36,438 --> 01:05:39,527
And now you outta here.

519
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:46,802
Come on.

520
01:05:50,416 --> 01:05:51,676
Come on.

521
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:57,532
I'm so sorry.

522
01:06:35,273 --> 01:06:37,259
Over here.
- Shoot.

523
01:06:41,774 --> 01:06:44,380
Come on.
- Stewart, two minutes penalty box.

524
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:59,336
I have the CD which we spoke,
Raised by Swans brought in.

525
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,242
Thank you.

526
01:07:02,704 --> 01:07:04,226
What?

527
01:07:08,001 --> 01:07:10,160
I've already downloaded their albums.

528
01:07:10,946 --> 01:07:15,141
The box you have not downloaded
or cover

529
01:07:15,513 --> 01:07:20,258
and the CD you can keep forever
and can hold in your hands.

530
01:07:26,978 --> 01:07:28,717
I hate the internet.

531
01:07:30,427 --> 01:07:32,363
Nothing is private,

532
01:07:32,363 --> 01:07:37,068
nothing is real, like you and me
who meet in the penalty area.

533
01:07:38,029 --> 01:07:40,619
Do you have a homepage?

534
01:07:47,531 --> 01:07:51,665
I knew it, I saw him,
I knew that you had to play today.

535
01:07:51,732 --> 01:07:55,618
A beautiful picture.
- I'm not that photogenic.

536
01:07:55,618 --> 01:07:59,811
Yes.
I think that picture of your beautiful mother.

537
01:07:59,845 --> 01:08:02,375
It says there is no picture of my mother.

538
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:04,940
She is not in the background,
if you receive that price?

539
01:08:05,526 --> 01:08:09,536
Yes, but she is not keen on.
- Yes, that's right.

540
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,251
I notice everything.

541
01:08:15,628 --> 01:08:17,150
Goodbye.

542
01:09:15,508 --> 01:09:17,618
Mom.
- Jesus.

543
01:09:18,208 --> 01:09:20,824
How did you get that music?
- From the shop.

544
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:22,961
Have you talked with that girl?
- What girl?

545
01:09:22,961 --> 01:09:24,988
Those in my office?
- What are you talking about?

546
01:09:25,022 --> 01:09:27,195
Is she here?
Where is she?

547
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:29,509
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

548
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:34,853
"I just left him.
Chloe.

549
01:09:35,849 --> 01:09:39,074
I do not know.

550
01:09:40,783 --> 01:09:42,559
I am sorry

551
01:09:49,895 --> 01:09:52,232
I said you had to call my husband.

552
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:55,872
I have not called,
He has called me.

553
01:09:56,688 --> 01:10:02,443
I still do not contact him.

554
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:08,991
When he rang, it was not about sex.

555
01:10:10,722 --> 01:10:14,062
It was about feelings
and vulnerability.

556
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:21,699
He says that if he touches you,
it feels as if he deceives me.

557
01:10:22,561 --> 01:10:24,571
Is not that weird?

558
01:10:25,953 --> 01:10:27,728
Did you hear me?

559
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:38,701
Take me about one hour,
in the Cafй Diplomatico.

560
01:10:49,804 --> 01:10:51,703
What's going on?
- You want some order?

561
01:10:51,703 --> 01:10:54,295
I have oral tests.
- This will not last long.

562
01:10:56,953 --> 01:10:59,331
Coffee please.
- I take cognac.

563
01:10:59,331 --> 01:11:01,175
And one for my wife Hennessy.

564
01:11:06,119 --> 01:11:07,762
What is this over?

565
01:11:07,795 --> 01:11:10,976
I wanted to give us the opportunity,
the cards on the table.

566
01:11:11,887 --> 01:11:15,612
I want us to tell each other everything,
the truth.

567
01:11:18,217 --> 01:11:20,788
Is there something you want to tell me?

568
01:11:21,369 --> 01:11:23,870
I?
- Say it plain.

569
01:11:26,926 --> 01:11:30,221
About New York?
- Okay.

570
01:11:35,217 --> 01:11:36,902
I lied.

571
01:11:39,742 --> 01:11:43,556
I did not want birthday
another day closer to my retirement,

572
01:11:43,623 --> 01:11:47,831
So I left, I had a drink,
even three.

573
01:11:47,831 --> 01:11:49,871
By Miranda.

574
01:11:49,871 --> 01:11:51,465
No.
- Yes, you.

575
01:11:51,465 --> 01:11:53,288
You listen my message.
- What have you done to her?

576
01:11:53,288 --> 01:11:55,906
You spying on me.
- I have your party planned for months.

577
01:11:55,906 --> 01:11:59,191
I have secretly called our friends,

578
01:11:59,225 --> 01:12:02,674
I've spent thousands of dollars
the cake, the catering and flowers.

579
01:12:02,674 --> 01:12:07,276
I play the super housewife
and you fucks a 18jarige, I'm an idiot.

580
01:12:07,343 --> 01:12:09,356
I fucked her,
I flirted with her.

581
01:12:09,356 --> 01:12:10,558
Damn.

582
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:20,631
What?

583
01:12:26,685 --> 01:12:28,131
What?

584
01:12:31,361 --> 01:12:33,439
What, Who is that girl?

585
01:12:42,799 --> 01:12:44,166
Nobody.

586
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:48,544
She nobody.

587
01:12:58,085 --> 01:13:00,162
It's over.

588
01:13:02,041 --> 01:13:03,749
That was it?

589
01:13:06,243 --> 01:13:11,103
Wait, you came here,
all cards on the table.

590
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:13,531
I am the only one who has admitted something.

591
01:13:13,565 --> 01:13:17,895
, I can not explain it,
it was so sudden, so unexpected

592
01:13:17,929 --> 01:13:21,330
and it's over now.
- And now I rejoice,

593
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:25,243
small affair with your midlife crisis?
- There was no affair.

594
01:13:31,047 --> 01:13:32,837
Please Catherine,

595
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:37,052
How often did I not tempted
and I've never done anything, ever.

596
01:13:37,052 --> 01:13:40,350
No, but you wanted it.
- I am a man.

597
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:44,879
You're saying you are different?
- I never want to be with someone else.

598
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:48,468
You lie to me.
You fucking lying.

599
01:13:55,817 --> 01:14:01,271
You pulled me away from my work,
You asked me to be honest

600
01:14:01,305 --> 01:14:04,050
and you have not told me.

601
01:14:15,408 --> 01:14:18,232
Wait, David.

602
01:14:21,642 --> 01:14:23,088
Sorry friend.

603
01:14:23,756 --> 01:14:27,199
I tell you,
she said that her name was Chloe.

604
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:31,101
That girl, I asked her to seduce you.

605
01:14:31,101 --> 01:14:34,282
I want to know what you would do,
because I thought you had an affair.

606
01:14:34,349 --> 01:14:37,389
I do not cheat.
- I know.

607
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:40,367
But she said that she had slept with you.
- What? This is ridiculous.

608
01:14:40,367 --> 01:14:43,758
She took my money
and lied about sex with you.

609
01:14:43,758 --> 01:14:48,231
I found her and she told me every detail.

610
01:14:49,332 --> 01:14:52,114
What then?
- Stories.

611
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:55,673
She said it started
with a picnic in the park.

612
01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:00,284
And Allan Gardens, greenhouse.

613
01:15:00,861 --> 01:15:04,829
She said she had kissed you
and she felt that you got excited.

614
01:15:05,298 --> 01:15:06,820
It was...

615
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:10,365
confusing.

616
01:15:12,213 --> 01:15:14,755
I felt so close to you.

617
01:15:15,765 --> 01:15:18,355
You're prettier every year.

618
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:22,192
Every gray hair, every wrinkle,

619
01:15:22,671 --> 01:15:26,487
everything happens to you
makes you covet worthy

620
01:15:26,487 --> 01:15:31,891
and I feel I solution,
if you against me blows. I disappear.

621
01:15:32,933 --> 01:15:36,066
I felt so invisible and so old.

622
01:15:40,449 --> 01:15:42,161
I've slept with her.

623
01:15:52,188 --> 01:15:54,810
We previously had sex three times a day.

624
01:15:55,146 --> 01:15:56,733
and then every day

625
01:15:56,733 --> 01:16:01,280
and then once a week and then
Michael was born and we became parents

626
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:06,939
and we were best friends and I knew
not how I had to be your lover.

627
01:16:07,623 --> 01:16:11,302
You hit me anymore.
- David, I could not respect myself.

628
01:16:11,302 --> 01:16:13,946
I did not know who I was.

629
01:16:14,865 --> 01:16:17,480
I think I'm 19
and I look in the mirror and I...

630
01:16:19,195 --> 01:16:22,465
am someone who does not know
how to seduce you should.

631
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,322
Show me the house once.

632
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:26,788
I want not only leave, but I'm late
and they murder me in school.

633
01:18:26,788 --> 01:18:29,038
I'll be there, I wait at home for you.

634
01:18:30,067 --> 01:18:32,212
I'm sorry,

635
01:18:32,245 --> 01:18:34,160
I do not trust.

636
01:18:37,945 --> 01:18:39,916
Come home soon.

637
01:18:51,995 --> 01:18:56,651
Where is the room of your parents?
- It's over.

638
01:19:26,234 --> 01:19:28,000
What are you doing?

639
01:20:25,646 --> 01:20:29,263
Look at me.

640
01:21:28,778 --> 01:21:31,318
Damn.

641
01:21:32,589 --> 01:21:33,899
Come on.

642
01:21:33,899 --> 01:21:35,783
Michael, get out.

643
01:21:36,819 --> 01:21:38,870
Come, let's go.

644
01:21:40,391 --> 01:21:44,802
Think you can buy me
and then I go?

645
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:49,815
Do you think if you give me money,
I pretend that nothing has been?

646
01:21:49,815 --> 01:21:54,495
Michael, I do not want you hear this,
Go away. Please go.

647
01:21:57,195 --> 01:21:59,313
Leave my son alone.

648
01:21:59,347 --> 01:22:03,436
He is not yours, your man is not yours,
I am not yours.

649
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:08,986
We do not know what you're saying, if you pay us
and if you want us

650
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:11,673
and if you want to go.

651
01:22:11,673 --> 01:22:14,238
Yes, I understand that it was a mistake,
to get you involved in my marriage,

652
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:20,700
but you should stay away from his.
- I felt you in him, in his eyes

653
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:23,996
and the little things he does.

654
01:22:24,517 --> 01:22:29,212
I think he's a good friend
for me can be, for going out.

655
01:22:29,212 --> 01:22:33,069
My husband can come home anytime.
- Is everything okay with David?

656
01:22:33,069 --> 01:22:35,413
Are you all right between you?
I have my job well done?

657
01:22:35,413 --> 01:22:39,447
I make sure you dress,
I take you home and then we talk further.

658
01:22:50,261 --> 01:22:52,469
You liked it.

659
01:22:53,898 --> 01:22:57,107
I'm sorry,
I have given you false hope.

660
01:23:00,802 --> 01:23:02,652
No, that's not true.

661
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:05,309
Pardon?
- Sorry your not.

662
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:11,541
You shared your secrets with me.
- Okay.

663
01:23:11,541 --> 01:23:16,757
We created our own world.
You said no no, you let me fall in love.

664
01:23:16,757 --> 01:23:19,497
I did not want that, I felt something,
but that was for my husband.

665
01:23:19,497 --> 01:23:21,848
You would not have recovered your husband,
If I had not been there.

666
01:23:21,848 --> 01:23:26,100
Let's go home.
- How can you inflict it,

667
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:27,730
I mean nothing to you?

668
01:23:28,745 --> 01:23:33,192
God, I did not want.
Please, let me take you home.

669
01:23:34,963 --> 01:23:36,416
Stop.

670
01:23:42,561 --> 01:23:45,911
You're beautiful
that you know.

671
01:23:45,944 --> 01:23:48,126
That you are real.

672
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:53,271
Tell me what you want.

673
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:00,066
I want you to kiss me.

674
01:24:10,571 --> 01:24:13,116
No.
- Oh my God.

675
01:26:05,066 --> 01:26:20,220
