There are references to this church
in a very old document

at some of the murals.

475

The oldest parts of St. Marina's date back
to the 11th to 12th century B.C.

-You're open? Look at you.

-Keep it there for about an hour.

Actually, it's been about a year.

Hey! Who's seen the Olympics on TV?

662
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,911
Well, we're going to Olympia,
the site of the very first Olympics.

663
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:29,679
The ancient games began in 776 B.C.

Now, all through the era of the Pisatans...

every 5 years.

Here's something interesting.

668
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:44,362
Until they were abolished
from 393 until 426 A.D.

669
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:47,199
And then in 1896...

670
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:52,066
Well, that's about the year
I started to stink.

671
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:10,523
I know every fact and every figure
about this place.

672
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:14,056
I mean, I love it here.
And they just want to have fun.

673
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:16,689
And I get it,
but I don't know how to make this job fun.

674
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,564
Well, if you call it a job, it ain't fun.

675
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:24,165
I mean, look at porn stars. They get to
schtup all day. They should be happy.

676
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,937
You never hear about a happy porn star.

677

-No, really, were you?
-I was an ice-cream taster.

681
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:43,960
-Get out.
-35 years.

682
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:48,292
-I wish I had that job.
-That's what my friends used to say.

683

But then Elinor got sick.

684
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,772
I had to take care of her and...

685

She always wanted to come to Greece.

So you work at an IHOP?

779
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:56,728
Yeah, well, I mean, that makes it sound
like I'm a waiter, you know.

780
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:59,233
I'm the number one
corporate representative for IHOP.

781
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,861
I sold 100 franchises last year.

782
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:05,499
We're expanding Ohio,
if you're looking for an investment.

783
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,668
How do we say, "Cheers"?

784
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,037
We say, "ya mas, to our health."

00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:23,852
Syrup.

789
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:28,292
I collect vintage syrups.

790
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:33,760
Yeah. Some people are
into art or wines, you know.

791
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,998
I'm into vintage syrups.
Not too old. When you say "vintage,"

792
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:40,042
you think, "Oh, my God,
the guy's drinking syrup from 1912."

793
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,668
No. The oldest I have is 1948.

794
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:45,907
So it's post-war, but it's still really special.

795
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:49,712
I mean, it's still edible. You can pote it.
It's potent, potable? Potable?

00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,809
I never watch Jeopardy!

797
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:53,617

I like about syrup is it's sweet,

798
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:55,157
no matter how bad your day is.

799
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:58,489
...a German waffle,
but there's also a French crepe.

800
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:00,256
I mean, we had to have
a whole meeting in Iowa,

801
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:02,525
because the waitresses
were calling them "craps."

802
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:05,999
And no one wants to eat crap
so much anymore.

803
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:07,263
Sometimes in Mississippi.

804
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:09,430
But usually you find that
people don't want to have

805
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,975
a food that's not appetizingly named,
you know.

806
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:16,603
That's why I love any kind
of an international flair.

807
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:20,649
Swedish crepes. It just automatically
sounds better. It's exotic.

808
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:24,687
My favorite, though, natural.
Pecans, coconut, which is so, so good.

809
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:28,815
It's very, very fattening, and... Not that
I have anything against fat people.

810

You can actually feel the energy

Do you feel it? This is the temple of Apollo

And she would crouch behind him,

and she would answer questions.

It wasn't you he cheated.
