- Daddy chose it.

Well, even great pianists think
twice before tackling the Polonaise.

No, of course.
It's just, uh...

162
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,793
It's just a few bad habits

play it already.

No. I will teach him
what I think is best.

201
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,348
Rachmaninoff is best.

so that was the end of him. We lost him.

Your father.

Oh.

504
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,676
He was forever busy
in his study.

505
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,758
"Go away, Kattie, I'm writing,"
he'd always say.

One day,
oh, I was very young,

507
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,909
I got so annoyed...

508
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,191
that I upset the ink pots
all over his desk...

509
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,279
and scrawled on his work,
pages of it.

"What are you doing?"
He shouted.

Well, there was this
terrible silence.

514
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,075
And I just stared at him and said,
"Go away, Daddy, I'm writing."

515
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,395
[Laughing] Well, he ran at me
and he picked me up...

On top. Yes, yes, yes.

Oh, yes. I always
agree, Professor.

- Is that wise?
- I-I don't know. Is it?

Don't forget...
it's on the page!

595
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,518
Yes. Well, the notes are on the page,
but, uh, not the feeling.

596
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,790
The emotion.
That's what I feel.

597
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,718
You mustn't sacrifice everything to
emotion. It's all a question of balance.

Ah, yes. Is that
the question, Professor?

[David] Gotta concentrate, Kath...
Gotta concentrate, Katherine.

622
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,475
Gotta practise, practise,
practise.

623
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,388
Because there's three important
things Professor Parkes says,
and that's work, work, work.

00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,795
[On Tape] A-A-And, uh,
so that's what I have to do...

625
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,673
if I'm gonna, uh, m-make the finals
to the Concerto Medal...

626
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,268

to play at the Royal Albert Hall,

[David]

so, uh, that's, uh,
a positive.

632
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,995
It's, uh, a positive,
isn't it, because, well...

00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,829
It seems to be because, uh, he didn't

We're gonna win, actually, Robert.
We're gonna win.

[Parkes]
Rachmaninoff? Are you sure?

641
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,916
Uh, kind of. I'm-I'm never really sure
about anything, Mr Parkes.

642
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,429
The Rach 3.

643
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,551
It's monumental.

644
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,036
It's, uh, it's a mountain. It's the, uh,
hardest piece you could "Everest" play.

645
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,436
Well, no one's ever been
mad enough to attempt the Rach 3.
