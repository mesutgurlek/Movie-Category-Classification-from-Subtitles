1
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:12,352
Okay... let me say this.

2
00:00:14,197 --> 00:00:15,459
Let me say this.

3
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:19,665
If I lost my wife and, uh,

4
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:22,728
the next day, a little bird
landed on my windowsill,

5
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:24,296
looked me right in the eye,

6
00:00:24,374 --> 00:00:28,868
and in plain English said,
"Sean, it's me, Anna. I'm back,"...

7
00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:34,478
What could I say?
I guess I'd believe her. Or I'd want to.

8
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:36,143
I'd be stuck with a bird.

9
00:00:37,153 --> 00:00:38,814
But other than that, no.

10
00:00:38,888 --> 00:00:42,051
I'm a man of science.
I just don't believe that mumbo-jumbo.

11
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,218
Now, that's gonna have
to be the last question.

12
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,228
I need to go running
before I head home.

13
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:30,142
Okay.

14
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:45,055
Oh. Excuse me.

15
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:50,489
I forgot the ribbon.

16
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:52,466
Come on.
I don't want to go up alone.

17
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:54,526
I'll be a minute.

18
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:29,262
Hi, I--

19
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:31,966
I met Anna at a party.

20
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:38,136
And I called her to see if she'd
go out with me, but she said no.

21
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:40,843
But I kept calling.

22
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:44,250
It took one year
to get her to have dinner with me.

23
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,223
A year after that,
I asked her to marry me.

24
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:50,782
She said no.

25
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,352
A year later, I asked her again
and she still said no.

26
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:58,263
Two weeks ago...

27
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,824
she said "Maybe."

28
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,968
Tonight I stand before you
with a "Yes."

29
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,007
Hi.

30
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:15,540
- How are you?
- Good.

31
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:19,381
I left, uh, the ribbon
in the car.

32
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:20,945
I'll be up in a minute.

33
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:21,100
Hi.

34
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,473
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thanks.

35
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:29,775
Would you like me to wrap it?

36
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:31,581
Make it look pretty.

37
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,482
Anna.

38
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,156
Clifford.

39
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,328
It's been a long time.

40
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:48,297
This is a good thing.
Congratulations.

41
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,369
- Hi.
- Hi.

42
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:53,772
I'm Joseph.

43
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,333
- This is--
- Clifford.

44
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:58,903
Congratulations.
Nice speech.

45
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:00,812
I've heard a lot about you.

46
00:10:02,618 --> 00:10:05,212
Clara's here.
She forgot a ribbon.

47
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:07,017
- Oh.
- For your present.

48
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:09,922
So I better go and wait for her.

49
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:11,323
Enjoy the festivities.

50
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:13,055
I will. We will.

51
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:14,460
Thank you.

52
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,628
I liked what you said.

53
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:54,669
Sean!

54
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:58,503
Sean!

55
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,905
One minute!

56
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:07,540
I'm coming!

57
00:11:30,673 --> 00:11:32,402
Let's eat this thing.

58
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,871
Bob, would you carve?

59
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,276
Sure.

60
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,279
Are the Drummonds here?
Where are the Drummonds?

61
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:46,150
They called. They said
they're gonna be late.

62
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:48,349
That they'd be here
for the cake.

63
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:50,221
Fine.

64
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,894
Anna's made a decision.

65
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,555
Oh.

66
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:58,063
You've picked a date?

67
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,934
- The merry month of May.
- Fantastic.

68
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:03,938
- Joe, congratulations.
- Thank you, Bob.

69
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:09,904
I wanted to tell her.

70
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,340
It's my wedding.

71
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,110
Can't I be excited?

72
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:15,741
May's a great month.

73
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,581
Nice and warm.

74
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,087
- Well done, Joseph.
- Thank you.

75
00:12:46,148 --> 00:12:47,206
Hi.

76
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:49,114
Are you coming
to Eleanor's party?

77
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,176
No. I want to see Anna.

78
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:56,522
I used to take lessons
and then I stopped.

79
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:58,423
I--I wish I hadn't.

80
00:12:58,494 --> 00:13:00,325
We're gonna do the cake.

81
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:02,594
Sorry we're late.

82
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:04,064
In the dining room.

83
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:06,298
Thank you.

84
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:53,178
Here we are.

85
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:57,212
Can you get the knife for her?

86
00:13:57,286 --> 00:13:58,617
Look at that.

87
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:04,219
No, I don't believe it.
Nice work.

88
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:06,284
Make a wish, Eleanor.

89
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:08,762
Laura and Anna
on each side of me.

90
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,699
Happy birthday, Mother.

91
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:13,495
Happy birthday, Mom.

92
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,039
I'm here to see Anna.

93
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,115
Who are you?

94
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:36,054
Who are you?

95
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,787
Let's go into the kitchen.
I'll tell you there.

96
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:42,263
Are you gonna play
a trick on me?

97
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:43,491
No.

98
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:47,061
Okay.

99
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:58,838
He wants to talk to me in private.

100
00:14:58,914 --> 00:15:00,643
Could you believe that?

101
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:10,881
What do you want?

102
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:14,627
You.

103
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:17,962
You want me?
Is that what you're saying?

104
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:19,364
You're my wife.

105
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:25,930
We're married? You're telling me
that we got married at some point in time?

106
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,339
Yes.

107
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:33,809
Well... I'm getting married to Joseph.
He's a little bit older than you.

108
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:36,373
We have a little bit more in common.

109
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:42,083
But if the timing was
a little bit different, who knows? Maybe.

110
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:45,558
You're a handsome little boy.
But I'm getting married to someone else.

111
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:47,619
It's me...

112
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,357
Sean.

113
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,129
You're telling me
that you're Sean?

114
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,537
Yes.

115
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,477
Let's go.

116
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,708
You'll be making a big mistake
if you marry Joseph.

117
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:22,657
Jimmy, do you know
who this is?

118
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,891
Sean.

119
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:27,766
Does he live in the building?

120
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:28,894
No.

121
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:30,905
Then put him in a taxi
and send him home.

122
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:32,133
Sure.

123
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:42,510
Do you know how
to take the subway?

124
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,075
- Yeah.
- You're not supposed to be here tonight.

125
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:49,654
Go home.

126
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,660
So?

127
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:10,542
He says he's Sean.

128
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:14,212
Sean.

129
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,944
Right.

130
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:17,713
His name was Sean.

131
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:22,752
No, really.
Jimmy said downstairs.

132
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:29,753
He says he doesn't want me
to marry Joseph.

133
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:58,523
He said I shouldn't marry you.

134
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:34,752
I'll pull the car around.

135
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,320
Okay.

136
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:10,560
Good morning.

137
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,828
Oh. What's this?

138
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,631
It was laying on my desk.

139
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:19,263
Your man is here.

140
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:26,502
Hey, Anna.

141
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:28,270
Hey, Peter.

142
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:34,405
Hmm...

143
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,008
This is fantastic.

144
00:20:37,085 --> 00:20:38,450
Are you trying to tell me

145
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,284
that this little boy is now urging you
not to marry Joseph?

146
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:42,721
What's fantastic about it?

147
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,191
Well, I mean, how often
does someone come along

148
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,251
claiming to be
somebody who's dead?

149
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:50,663
And much less a little boy.

150
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:54,099
Why didn't you tell me?

151
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,036
I--l'm telling you now.
I didn't want to upset you.

152
00:20:57,105 --> 00:20:58,299
Well, who the hell is he?

153
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:04,578
Is he claiming to be... Sean,
or is he just called Sean?

154
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:08,241
He said, "lt's me, Sean."
What am I supposed to think?

155
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:12,447
I suppose that that tells me
that he's telling me he's Sean.

156
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:15,416
That he is your dead husband.

157
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,117
That he is...

158
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,558
Oh, that he is what?

159
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:23,128
Could it be true?

160
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,291
Oh, please.
God help me. Somebody.

161
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,047
This is Jimmy.

162
00:21:46,121 --> 00:21:47,611
Watch the fort.

163
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:51,859
Why did you think
it would upset me?

164
00:21:54,763 --> 00:21:56,196
Has it?

165
00:21:56,264 --> 00:21:58,926
Well, you didn't show it to me
when you first got it, so...

166
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:01,993
I didn't open it
until I got to work.

167
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,560
Weren't you curious?

168
00:22:04,673 --> 00:22:06,504
I didn't knowwho it was from.

169
00:22:08,143 --> 00:22:09,474
Anyway, don't be silly.

170
00:22:09,544 --> 00:22:11,205
Do me up.

171
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:12,769
We're gonna be late.

172
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:17,549
I can understand why a little boy
would be in love with you.

173
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,481
Let's stop talking
about the little boy.

174
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:23,046
I want to go out with my fiancé.

175
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,456
Okay.

176
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:25,857
I love you.

177
00:22:28,563 --> 00:22:31,555
Don't you think we should call Jimmy
and find out who he is?

178
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:34,295
Christ. Let's just forget about it.

179
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:35,700
Aren't you interested?

180
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:38,232
No.

181
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:44,872
It's probably just some prank.

182
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:00,319
Hey, Jimmy.
Uh, Joseph, 1001.

183
00:23:00,395 --> 00:23:03,558
<i>Listen. a little boy named Sean
left a letter for Anna--</i>

184
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,293
Jimmy's outside.

185
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:09,834
Who is this?

186
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:11,497
Sean.

187
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:21,246
I think your husband's downstairs.

188
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,319
Hey.

189
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:39,460
You're on your own?

190
00:23:39,534 --> 00:23:40,933
My dad's upstairs.

191
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,869
Huh. Does your father live here?

192
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:45,566
No.

193
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,471
Can I talk to your father?

194
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:16,059
202.

195
00:24:23,778 --> 00:24:25,609
My father's a tutor.

196
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:46,198
Yes, hi. I'm Joseph.
I live upstairs.

197
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:48,702
Oh, sure. Hi.
Hi, Sean.

198
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,101
Everything all right?

199
00:24:50,172 --> 00:24:51,799
I just need to talk to his father.

200
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:53,033
I'll be right back.

201
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:00,479
What's wrong?

202
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:02,540
- Everything's fine.
- Who are you?

203
00:25:03,618 --> 00:25:05,108
Joseph from upstairs.

204
00:25:05,187 --> 00:25:07,485
Yeah, sure.
What's wrong?

205
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:09,717
- Well--
- What's wrong? What's the problem?

206
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,725
I need to talk to you
about your son.

207
00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:16,121
I'll be right back.

208
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,597
202.

209
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:32,707
I want you to tell her right now that you'll
never see her or bother her again.

210
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,873
I can't.

211
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,782
Tell her you'll never see her
or bother her again.

212
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:42,114
No.

213
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,350
- Do it.
- No.

214
00:25:43,425 --> 00:25:44,915
Tell her, Sean.

215
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:46,517
I can't.

216
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:48,586
Why did you write this?

217
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:50,563
Why did you go into her house?

218
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,463
I needed to talk to her.

219
00:25:52,534 --> 00:25:56,937
Well, I want you to tell her right now that
you'll never see her or bother her again.

220
00:25:58,206 --> 00:25:59,468
- No.
- Sean, tell her.

221
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:00,974
- No.
- You're hurting me.

222
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:04,205
Sean, tell her you'll never see her
or bother her again.

223
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,439
I can't.

224
00:26:05,513 --> 00:26:07,344
Do you understand that?

225
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:10,475
- Say it.
- I can't.

226
00:26:12,854 --> 00:26:15,448
I don't want you
to bother me again.

227
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,150
We're gonna be late.

228
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:24,793
Thank you.

229
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:46,148
Well done.

230
00:29:17,906 --> 00:29:19,897
I don't know.

231
00:29:19,974 --> 00:29:22,374
I just think it's
a little bit funny, that's all.

232
00:29:23,445 --> 00:29:25,777
No, it's not funny.
I'm taking it out of context.

233
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:29,112
He says that he's somebody else,
and he believes that he is.

234
00:29:29,951 --> 00:29:32,215
That's ridiculous.

235
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:34,551
I don't know these people.
I don't know who they are.

236
00:29:34,622 --> 00:29:36,749
These people have money,
that's all.

237
00:29:40,228 --> 00:29:42,560
And he wrote this woman a letter.
He's, um...

238
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,190
He wrote her a letter
not to marry this guy.

239
00:29:50,305 --> 00:29:52,296
Permission to turn off
the light, sir.

240
00:29:55,477 --> 00:29:57,308
Permission to turn off the light.

241
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:05,349
The men are talking
below deck, sir.

242
00:30:10,425 --> 00:30:12,154
They're talking mutiny.

243
00:30:21,035 --> 00:30:23,970
It's your responsibility
to steer the ship.

244
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,069
It's just seasickness, sir.

245
00:30:29,143 --> 00:30:31,976
I'm not your stupid son anymore.

246
00:31:39,347 --> 00:31:42,680
Go to the principal and explain
why you're late for my class!

247
00:32:15,116 --> 00:32:16,276
Anna...

248
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,751
<i>You're being silly about this.</i>

249
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:21,382
<i>Meet me at the park.</i>

250
00:32:22,223 --> 00:32:23,713
<i>You know where.</i>

251
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,898
I thought you and Joseph
were going to talk to him.

252
00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:33,627
We did.

253
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,192
- So why's he calling the house?
- I don't know.

254
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:56,579
What was the message?

255
00:33:00,028 --> 00:33:03,122
He said he wanted you to go
and meet him in the park.

256
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,056
That you'd know where to go.

257
00:33:06,134 --> 00:33:07,624
That's what he said.

258
00:35:18,132 --> 00:35:19,963
You think this is a game?
You think this is funny?

259
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,365
No.

260
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:27,737
What if Bob comes
to my house and tests me?

261
00:35:31,412 --> 00:35:33,141
How do you know Bob?

262
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,512
He was my brother-in-law.

263
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:41,251
If he asks me some questions
and I get them right, will you believe me?

264
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,552
Will you believe me?

265
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,661
Who told me
there wasn't a Santa Claus?

266
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,336
I'll know them when I see them.

267
00:35:57,605 --> 00:35:59,766
You're just a little boy.

268
00:36:13,887 --> 00:36:15,218
It's amazing.

269
00:36:18,892 --> 00:36:20,154
It is.

270
00:36:21,328 --> 00:36:22,818
I can't figure it out.

271
00:36:24,198 --> 00:36:25,597
Me neither.

272
00:36:27,534 --> 00:36:29,331
He knewwhere Sean died.

273
00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:37,008
I'm tired.

274
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,611
Let's sleep.

275
00:36:57,598 --> 00:36:58,929
We'll get him.

276
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:18,178
I'm going to tape this... okay?

277
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:23,053
I'm not a psychiatrist.

278
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:26,255
I'm not a therapist.

279
00:37:26,326 --> 00:37:29,591
I'm just a regular doctor.

280
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:37,397
You know...
if you were my brother-in-law,

281
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:41,805
you'd say it was impossible for you
to be sitting right here in front of me.

282
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:45,208
You didn't believe
in life after death.

283
00:37:46,113 --> 00:37:49,947
You believed
that only matter survives

284
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:55,819
and that the mind, soul, spirit--
whatever you want to call it--

285
00:37:55,889 --> 00:37:58,483
disappears forever.

286
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:00,151
What do you want to know?

287
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,191
Okay.

288
00:38:06,633 --> 00:38:08,624
Where did you live?

289
00:38:08,702 --> 00:38:11,102
In the apartment
where Anna lives now.

290
00:38:12,172 --> 00:38:14,504
Didn't you and Anna
have your own place?

291
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:16,008
- No.
- Why not?

292
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:17,407
I wasn't around much.

293
00:38:17,477 --> 00:38:19,911
I was too busy working.

294
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,675
Where?

295
00:38:21,748 --> 00:38:23,079
Different places.

296
00:38:23,817 --> 00:38:25,148
Give me one.

297
00:38:27,387 --> 00:38:30,117
Your hospital.
I lectured there.

298
00:38:31,024 --> 00:38:32,286
About what?

299
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,424
Splitting the atom.

300
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:44,500
Why don't you and Laura
have your own place anymore?

301
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,571
- We do.
- Why aren't you living there?

302
00:38:54,214 --> 00:38:57,308
- What do you remember about Anna--
- You lost your job.

303
00:38:57,384 --> 00:39:01,218
No. No, I didn't lose my job.

304
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:03,119
We're redecorating.

305
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,555
We're having a baby.

306
00:39:05,492 --> 00:39:06,652
Wow.

307
00:39:07,794 --> 00:39:10,524
I didn't think she
could have a baby.

308
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,330
<i>Let's just stick to Anna.</i>

309
00:39:22,242 --> 00:39:25,905
<i>How about something...
intimate.</i>

310
00:39:27,014 --> 00:39:29,175
<i>We got married 30 times.</i>

311
00:39:30,717 --> 00:39:32,378
<i>That's a lot.</i>

312
00:39:32,452 --> 00:39:35,285
<i>Thirty churches in 30 days.</i>

313
00:39:36,924 --> 00:39:39,757
<i>Was I ever your best man?</i>

314
00:39:39,826 --> 00:39:42,920
<i>- Clifford was my best man.
- Clifford was your best man.</i>

315
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:48,999
How about something
that you couldn't have overheard,

316
00:39:49,069 --> 00:39:51,333
or looked up.

317
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,401
We did it on your sofa.

318
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:00,371
Okay.

319
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:02,039
The green sofa.

320
00:40:06,787 --> 00:40:10,621
Look, you can think
whatever you want.

321
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:14,324
Everybody can think
what they want.

322
00:40:14,394 --> 00:40:17,625
You can talk to whoever you want.
It doesn't matter.

323
00:40:17,698 --> 00:40:22,635
<i>I'm Sean. I love Anna.
and nothing is going to change that.</i>

324
00:40:22,703 --> 00:40:24,034
<i>Nothing.</i>

325
00:40:25,605 --> 00:40:27,197
<i>That's forever.</i>

326
00:40:30,544 --> 00:40:31,704
<i>Okay.</i>

327
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,138
<i>Thank you.</i>

328
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:08,212
Can I get, uh, either of you
something to drink?

329
00:41:08,281 --> 00:41:09,441
Uh, no.

330
00:41:09,516 --> 00:41:11,279
Yes, please.

331
00:41:11,351 --> 00:41:12,978
Want some juice?

332
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,782
- Apple.
- Please.

333
00:41:14,855 --> 00:41:16,584
Please.

334
00:41:16,656 --> 00:41:18,146
Remember me?

335
00:41:19,426 --> 00:41:21,257
A little.

336
00:41:21,328 --> 00:41:23,262
Well, I'm gonna keep
an eye on you...

337
00:41:24,664 --> 00:41:27,155
... in case you start
upsetting this family.

338
00:41:45,585 --> 00:41:47,177
Sean?

339
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,415
Would you like
to come sit down?

340
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:51,389
I'm gonna say it now.

341
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:54,120
I'm just gonna say it right now.

342
00:41:54,194 --> 00:41:56,992
You are not my sister's husband.

343
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:00,357
He's not.

344
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:03,164
So let's just start from there.

345
00:42:04,037 --> 00:42:07,871
And from now on,
we're gonna tell the truth.

346
00:42:07,941 --> 00:42:09,841
No more lying.

347
00:42:11,078 --> 00:42:12,409
Thank you, Lee.

348
00:42:19,753 --> 00:42:24,486
There's cake left from my birthday party.
Would you like to have some?

349
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:31,153
He told me he's not
my son anymore.

350
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:46,205
Let him sleep here tonight.

351
00:42:52,919 --> 00:42:55,387
I'm gonna break this spell.

352
00:43:00,927 --> 00:43:05,591
I'll pick him up from school tomorrow
and I'll bring him back to you.

353
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:16,031
Don't touch that.

354
00:43:29,823 --> 00:43:31,484
This is my desk.

355
00:43:45,005 --> 00:43:46,495
I used to work here.

356
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,090
Do you know me?

357
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,491
Yes.

358
00:44:09,496 --> 00:44:13,592
But we didn't meet officially
at the birthday party.

359
00:44:15,735 --> 00:44:16,997
No.

360
00:44:18,205 --> 00:44:20,537
No. That's right.
We didn't.

361
00:44:21,808 --> 00:44:23,969
And do you know my name?

362
00:44:27,647 --> 00:44:29,171
Do you know my name?

363
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,342
No.

364
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,079
Then how do you know me?

365
00:44:33,787 --> 00:44:37,223
You were the one that told Anna
there wasn't a Santa Claus.

366
00:44:49,135 --> 00:44:51,069
How do you know
where Sean died?

367
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:56,702
Do you know
what déjà vu is?

368
00:44:56,776 --> 00:44:58,368
Sure.

369
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,935
It was like that.

370
00:45:01,581 --> 00:45:03,572
How did Sean meet Anna?

371
00:45:04,551 --> 00:45:06,382
Didn't she tell you?

372
00:45:11,524 --> 00:45:13,515
How did Sean meet Anna?

373
00:45:13,593 --> 00:45:15,527
We met at the beach.

374
00:45:15,595 --> 00:45:19,087
How's Mr. Reincarnation
enjoying his cake?

375
00:45:20,066 --> 00:45:21,931
He likes it.

376
00:45:22,836 --> 00:45:24,428
Where's Anna?

377
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,637
The only reason she's
letting you stay in this house

378
00:45:27,707 --> 00:45:31,199
is because she wants to help you.
So don't get the wrong idea.

379
00:45:32,012 --> 00:45:33,843
How do you know
what you know?

380
00:45:35,882 --> 00:45:37,372
I'm Sean.

381
00:46:25,665 --> 00:46:27,326
You don't have me fooled.

382
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:53,320
I was surprised
to see you at the party.

383
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,554
I wasn't expecting you to come.

384
00:46:55,628 --> 00:46:58,859
I'm sorry.
I-- It's been so long.

385
00:46:58,932 --> 00:47:02,424
Too many memories, you know?
I'm sorry--

386
00:47:02,502 --> 00:47:04,663
What? That's okay.

387
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,535
- I apologize.
- It's okay.

388
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,410
I've met, um...

389
00:47:15,949 --> 00:47:21,683
I've met somebody who, uh,
who seems to be... Sean.

390
00:47:22,455 --> 00:47:24,286
Wh-what do you mean?

391
00:47:25,525 --> 00:47:26,753
What are you saying?

392
00:47:26,826 --> 00:47:29,317
I understand that this
is gonna sound crazy,

393
00:47:29,396 --> 00:47:33,059
and it's not like I haven't already
laughed about it, believe me, and...

394
00:47:33,133 --> 00:47:34,794
um...

395
00:47:34,868 --> 00:47:37,598
You know that I loved Sean.
You know.

396
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:38,967
So much.

397
00:47:39,038 --> 00:47:41,199
Of course.

398
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:45,204
If anyone understands that,
you understand it.

399
00:47:46,746 --> 00:47:48,543
You know I sent you a card.

400
00:47:50,316 --> 00:47:51,578
Christmas.

401
00:47:54,087 --> 00:47:55,679
You got those?

402
00:47:55,755 --> 00:47:57,052
Yeah.

403
00:47:57,223 --> 00:47:58,713
Yeah.

404
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,158
It's taken me this long,

405
00:48:01,227 --> 00:48:03,991
and I can't get him out
of my system. I can't.

406
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:09,735
I can't. It's not...
gotten any easier for me.

407
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:10,963
And, uh...

408
00:48:12,138 --> 00:48:13,799
I met--I met Joseph,

409
00:48:13,873 --> 00:48:16,967
and he--he loves me,
he sincerely does love me.

410
00:48:17,043 --> 00:48:20,376
And he's... you know,
he's been dealing with me on this.

411
00:48:20,447 --> 00:48:22,642
He's been, um...

412
00:48:22,715 --> 00:48:25,309
... he's been acceptant of it
and he's not...

413
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:29,181
He's now grown insecure.

414
00:48:29,255 --> 00:48:31,246
Because of him.

415
00:48:31,324 --> 00:48:34,191
I mean, he's ten years old.

416
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,524
What are you saying?

417
00:48:36,596 --> 00:48:38,791
He's a little boy.

418
00:48:38,865 --> 00:48:41,390
He's a little boy,
I know, and...

419
00:48:41,468 --> 00:48:44,631
he said, um--and he told me
his name was Sean, you know--

420
00:48:44,704 --> 00:48:48,231
I really hoped that he was Sean,
I really--I wanted him to be Sean,

421
00:48:48,308 --> 00:48:50,970
but I knew he wasn't Sean.
I knew it.

422
00:48:51,044 --> 00:48:52,978
This is insane.
I mean...

423
00:48:54,547 --> 00:48:57,812
It's insane, you know.
But I couldn't help it. I couldn't.

424
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,212
I don't think there's anything strange
about that. I mean, he is...

425
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:08,454
he is coming into...
our house.

426
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:12,259
He came into my mother's
birthday party unannounced.

427
00:49:12,332 --> 00:49:16,894
He came in, and we thought that he was
with the, um, the Drummonds, you know.

428
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:19,461
You remember Mr.
and Mrs. Drummond, don't you?

429
00:49:21,608 --> 00:49:22,666
Yeah.

430
00:49:22,742 --> 00:49:23,902
I'm sorry.

431
00:49:24,577 --> 00:49:25,839
Well...

432
00:49:28,348 --> 00:49:31,283
He came in... with them

433
00:49:31,351 --> 00:49:35,287
and he told me that he loves me

434
00:49:35,355 --> 00:49:38,188
and that he doesn't want me
to marry Joseph.

435
00:49:40,126 --> 00:49:43,892
And I thought,
"This is a joke. It's silly."

436
00:49:46,366 --> 00:49:47,697
And I told him to go home,

437
00:49:47,767 --> 00:49:51,032
and then, um, he sent me a letter
the next day that said...

438
00:49:53,273 --> 00:49:54,865
"Don't marry Joseph."

439
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:59,571
I mean, normally
you'd think this is...

440
00:49:59,646 --> 00:50:01,307
<i>Normally...</i>

441
00:50:01,381 --> 00:50:03,576
"This kid needs some help."

442
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:05,982
And I told him I didn't want
to see him again,

443
00:50:06,052 --> 00:50:08,452
and then he, um...

444
00:50:11,858 --> 00:50:13,689
... he collapsed.

445
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,921
And it, uh, it hit me.

446
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:30,969
Anna...

447
00:50:32,545 --> 00:50:36,037
I don't know how he knows
so much about me, but he does.

448
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:38,414
How can I help?

449
00:50:38,484 --> 00:50:41,146
I don't want to fall
in love again with Sean.

450
00:50:42,488 --> 00:50:43,978
You understand?

451
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,790
And that's what's happening.

452
00:50:49,762 --> 00:50:52,754
And I need you to come and help me,
and I need you to talk to him,

453
00:50:52,832 --> 00:50:54,993
and I need you
to tell him to go away.

454
00:50:58,504 --> 00:50:59,562
Sure.

455
00:51:03,009 --> 00:51:04,169
Yeah, sure.

456
00:51:07,547 --> 00:51:09,037
Because I can't do it.

457
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:05,429
A man has to support his wife. He has
to feed her, defend her, take care of her.

458
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:11,574
How are you gonna feed me,
defend me... take care of me?

459
00:52:11,644 --> 00:52:13,043
How are you gonna do that?

460
00:52:13,112 --> 00:52:14,602
I'll get a job.

461
00:52:23,456 --> 00:52:25,651
How are you
gonna fulfill my needs?

462
00:52:28,428 --> 00:52:30,259
I know what you're talking about.

463
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,899
You're ready for that?

464
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:46,569
You ever made love to a girl?

465
00:52:51,884 --> 00:52:53,442
You'd be the first.

466
00:52:58,624 --> 00:53:00,023
That's my bus.

467
00:53:39,832 --> 00:53:43,996
Listen, I appreciate
that you like me so much, but you're...

468
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:47,233
you're imagining something that it--
it isn't real.

469
00:53:47,306 --> 00:53:50,901
I mean, you're gonna eventually
meet someone your own age

470
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,842
and you'll forget about me.

471
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:21,973
I'm just gonna wait for her here
by this window.

472
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:24,771
- No answer?
- Uh, no.

473
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:27,244
- I'm gonna let them in.
- Pretend I'm not here.

474
00:54:27,313 --> 00:54:29,645
- They have an appointment too.
- Sure.

475
00:54:35,922 --> 00:54:39,824
This is a four-bedroom apartment.
The kitchen's back here.

476
00:54:39,892 --> 00:54:44,386
And if you come this way, the moldings
and the wall fixtures are original.

477
00:54:44,463 --> 00:54:45,953
This is the first bedroom.

478
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,523
Isn't it spacious?
I just love the light.

479
00:55:58,738 --> 00:56:00,899
<i>I hope you weren't too worried.</i>

480
00:56:02,008 --> 00:56:03,908
No. I'm fine.

481
00:56:03,976 --> 00:56:05,307
<i>If it's okay with you.</i>

482
00:56:05,378 --> 00:56:09,109
I think he should hear the music tonight
and know that we're getting married.

483
00:56:13,452 --> 00:56:15,113
<i>I'll bring him back later.</i>

484
00:56:15,187 --> 00:56:16,518
Great.

485
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:19,451
<i>Tell him I love him.</i>

486
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,420
Bye.

487
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:08,497
What are you doing?

488
00:58:09,668 --> 00:58:11,636
I'm looking at my wife.

489
00:58:58,784 --> 00:59:00,445
I want you to leave.

490
01:00:00,412 --> 01:00:01,743
I'd like you to stop that.

491
01:00:24,837 --> 01:00:25,861
It's not a funny matter.

492
01:00:26,705 --> 01:00:28,605
- It's not a funny matter.
- No!

493
01:00:28,674 --> 01:00:30,335
Anna, stay away!

494
01:00:30,409 --> 01:00:31,671
- Stay away.
- Joe!

495
01:00:34,847 --> 01:00:36,838
Hey, Joe...

496
01:00:38,984 --> 01:00:40,713
Joe. Joe!

497
01:00:40,786 --> 01:00:41,844
Joe!

498
01:00:44,089 --> 01:00:45,147
I'm great.

499
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,988
- Are you okay?
- I'm great. I'm great.

500
01:00:53,732 --> 01:00:55,723
He has no clue
how to make something happen.

501
01:00:55,801 --> 01:00:59,032
He's living in a land where he's pretending
to be something instead of doing the job.

502
01:00:59,104 --> 01:01:00,765
And that's the real problem.

503
01:01:01,807 --> 01:01:04,708
I'm the one who should
be respected, but obviously not.

504
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:24,854
No, Joseph!

505
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:30,159
He kicked my chair!

506
01:02:56,722 --> 01:02:57,882
Hello?

507
01:03:11,603 --> 01:03:14,367
- Where are you going to stay?
- Bob's place.

508
01:03:17,743 --> 01:03:19,574
I'll talk to her.

509
01:03:31,957 --> 01:03:33,686
Hi.

510
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:36,721
How are you?

511
01:03:36,795 --> 01:03:38,194
I'm okay.

512
01:03:50,008 --> 01:03:51,168
Good night.

513
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:06,481
I guess we missed the show.

514
01:04:08,227 --> 01:04:09,819
You're a little late.

515
01:04:10,829 --> 01:04:13,491
Clara left a bottle
of wine in the car.

516
01:04:13,565 --> 01:04:15,726
She'll be up in a minute.

517
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:53,331
I need to speak to Clifford.

518
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:10,478
That's not Sean.

519
01:05:17,029 --> 01:05:18,428
Yes, it is.

520
01:05:20,332 --> 01:05:23,130
No. It's not.

521
01:05:23,202 --> 01:05:24,533
Yes, it is.

522
01:06:27,466 --> 01:06:28,626
Hi.

523
01:06:44,149 --> 01:06:46,140
You see how dirty my hands are?

524
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:53,255
Take me to the bathroom
so I can wash up.

525
01:07:16,915 --> 01:07:18,075
Come in.

526
01:07:21,987 --> 01:07:23,318
Shut the door.

527
01:07:39,104 --> 01:07:40,435
Dry them.

528
01:08:10,602 --> 01:08:11,933
I've moved.

529
01:08:13,805 --> 01:08:15,295
My new address.

530
01:08:20,746 --> 01:08:22,577
Don't tell Anna.

531
01:08:24,516 --> 01:08:25,676
Okay.

532
01:08:33,091 --> 01:08:34,422
Let's go.

533
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:09,319
It is illegal.

534
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:19,760
Anna, look at me.

535
01:09:30,382 --> 01:09:32,373
You're going to go in there
right now--

536
01:09:32,451 --> 01:09:34,112
- Move.
- Sit down!

537
01:09:34,186 --> 01:09:36,245
You're going to tell Sean
to go home.

538
01:09:36,321 --> 01:09:37,447
No.

539
01:09:39,024 --> 01:09:43,461
If you don't, I will call his mother,
and his mother will call the police.

540
01:09:43,528 --> 01:09:45,189
You understand?

541
01:09:46,465 --> 01:09:48,194
No.

542
01:09:48,266 --> 01:09:49,426
Laura, move.

543
01:11:40,045 --> 01:11:41,876
What are we going to do?

544
01:11:45,784 --> 01:11:48,582
We're gonna tell your mother
that everything is okay.

545
01:11:50,689 --> 01:11:52,020
Then what?

546
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:56,789
I don't know yet,
but I'm thinking.

547
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:53,041
You're not Sean.

548
01:13:53,111 --> 01:13:54,635
Yes, I am.

549
01:13:59,651 --> 01:14:02,484
When you opened the door
for me yesterday...

550
01:14:02,554 --> 01:14:04,488
I knew you weren't Sean.

551
01:14:05,824 --> 01:14:07,314
Who are you?

552
01:14:07,392 --> 01:14:10,452
I thought you said you're Sean.

553
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:16,962
I'm your lover.

554
01:14:18,003 --> 01:14:19,595
Anna's my lover.

555
01:14:19,671 --> 01:14:21,070
I'm your lover.

556
01:14:23,641 --> 01:14:25,131
Anna's your wife.

557
01:14:40,325 --> 01:14:41,917
If you had been Sean...

558
01:14:43,361 --> 01:14:45,226
... and I kind of hoped you had...

559
01:14:47,899 --> 01:14:50,060
... you would've come to me first.

560
01:14:56,841 --> 01:14:58,832
And I would've explored this.

561
01:15:01,579 --> 01:15:02,978
But you didn't.

562
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:10,911
Are they in the bag?

563
01:15:23,802 --> 01:15:25,394
Here they are.

564
01:15:26,504 --> 01:15:27,994
Hello.

565
01:15:30,475 --> 01:15:32,636
Anna's little love letters.

566
01:15:43,855 --> 01:15:46,517
You can't go around
saying you're someone you're not.

567
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:03,236
Wipe your feet.

568
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:05,970
- Wipe your feet.
- I did too!

569
01:16:06,044 --> 01:16:08,308
- Hi, Clara.
- Hi. How are you?

570
01:16:08,379 --> 01:16:10,244
- I'm fine. How are you?
- Good.

571
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:11,976
- Have a nice night.
- You, too.

572
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:28,225
He gave them to me unopened.

573
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:31,591
To prove that he loved me more.

574
01:16:33,538 --> 01:16:36,803
He couldn't leave her,
and I hated her for that. Hated her.

575
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:43,170
When I found out she was getting
married again, I got us invited.

576
01:16:44,182 --> 01:16:47,015
What a nice present it would be
to give her her letters back.

577
01:16:48,253 --> 01:16:51,654
I wrapped them.
And I took them.

578
01:16:53,591 --> 01:16:54,990
But I couldn't do it.

579
01:16:57,795 --> 01:16:59,524
I changed my mind.

580
01:17:02,433 --> 01:17:04,594
Sorry, kid,
but you're not him.

581
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:27,951
Excuse me. Anna.

582
01:17:28,927 --> 01:17:30,087
Your mother just called.

583
01:17:30,161 --> 01:17:32,755
She said your sister just gave birth
to a healthy baby girl.

584
01:17:34,499 --> 01:17:36,660
- Wow.
- Congratulations.

585
01:18:45,203 --> 01:18:47,103
Maybe that's Sean.

586
01:18:50,108 --> 01:18:52,474
- I believe him.
- I know you do.

587
01:18:52,543 --> 01:18:55,512
There's no way I'm gonna
leave that boy. No way.

588
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:58,481
Don't try to make me.
You're wasting your time. Forget it.

589
01:19:00,018 --> 01:19:01,747
So what are you going to do?

590
01:19:05,556 --> 01:19:06,887
I don't know.

591
01:19:08,559 --> 01:19:10,993
The best thing
for you to do is this.

592
01:19:11,062 --> 01:19:13,553
Go home and write him
a goodbye letter.

593
01:19:13,631 --> 01:19:16,498
Then go to see Joseph
after work tomorrow.

594
01:19:16,567 --> 01:19:18,899
Don't call.
Just show up.

595
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:21,029
Tell him you're sorry,
you made a mistake.

596
01:19:21,105 --> 01:19:22,436
I can't.

597
01:19:23,474 --> 01:19:25,135
When Laura wakes up,
I'll call you.

598
01:19:25,209 --> 01:19:26,540
I can't.

599
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:29,938
What if we open the beach house?

600
01:19:30,014 --> 01:19:32,209
Then you can get married
where I married your father.

601
01:19:32,283 --> 01:19:34,945
You love the water.
It'll be beautiful in May.

602
01:19:35,887 --> 01:19:37,821
Didn't you hear what I said?

603
01:19:38,956 --> 01:19:40,548
What's your name?

604
01:19:42,927 --> 01:19:44,258
Where's your mother?

605
01:19:47,065 --> 01:19:49,556
Why don't you tell us where you live?
We'll take you home.

606
01:19:49,634 --> 01:19:51,465
I can't do that.

607
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:52,935
Why not?

608
01:19:53,905 --> 01:19:56,772
I have to go tell Anna
l'm not her husband.

609
01:19:58,209 --> 01:19:59,767
I thought I was Sean,

610
01:19:59,844 --> 01:20:03,075
but I found out he was in love
with another woman.

611
01:20:03,147 --> 01:20:04,637
So I can't be him.

612
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:07,207
'Cause I'm in love with Anna.

613
01:20:07,285 --> 01:20:09,617
- No kidding.
<i>- Do you have a lost child?</i>

614
01:20:12,023 --> 01:20:15,959
Central, we have a male, white,
approximately nine to ten years of age.

615
01:20:16,027 --> 01:20:19,019
Blue jacket, black shirt,
gray pants.

616
01:20:19,697 --> 01:20:21,631
Let's take him back to the house.

617
01:20:21,699 --> 01:20:23,860
Hey! Come back here!

618
01:20:42,153 --> 01:20:43,347
He's back.

619
01:20:46,724 --> 01:20:49,557
I called his mother.
She'll be here soon.

620
01:20:51,195 --> 01:20:52,685
He's in the bath.

621
01:21:19,924 --> 01:21:21,516
I have a plan.

622
01:21:24,228 --> 01:21:27,527
We're gonna run away together.
You and me.

623
01:21:31,002 --> 01:21:32,162
Okay?

624
01:21:34,572 --> 01:21:38,303
And in 1 1 years,
you're gonna turn 21.

625
01:21:38,376 --> 01:21:39,707
Okay?

626
01:21:41,179 --> 01:21:42,510
You hear me?

627
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:44,641
Do you hear me?

628
01:21:46,617 --> 01:21:49,279
And we're gonna get married.
Okay?

629
01:21:56,661 --> 01:21:59,289
I wonder...

630
01:21:59,363 --> 01:22:01,695
... what you're gonna look like.

631
01:22:18,583 --> 01:22:20,175
I love you, Sean.

632
01:22:37,535 --> 01:22:39,127
I'm not Sean.

633
01:23:07,765 --> 01:23:09,494
I'm not Sean.

634
01:23:10,601 --> 01:23:12,569
Because I love you.

635
01:23:20,044 --> 01:23:22,035
You make no sense.

636
01:23:27,818 --> 01:23:30,150
I can't explain it to you better.

637
01:23:31,389 --> 01:23:33,323
You're gonna have to.

638
01:23:39,230 --> 01:23:41,562
Can I please have a towel, Anna.

639
01:23:41,632 --> 01:23:43,793
I have to get my clothes back on.

640
01:23:43,868 --> 01:23:46,200
My mother's going
to be here soon.

641
01:23:53,411 --> 01:23:55,311
You're a little liar.

642
01:23:55,379 --> 01:23:57,040
Aren't you?!

643
01:23:57,114 --> 01:24:00,106
You're a little liar!
Is that what you are?

644
01:24:01,485 --> 01:24:03,316
Is that what you are?!

645
01:24:03,387 --> 01:24:06,049
- Yes.
- Yes? Is that what you said?

646
01:24:06,824 --> 01:24:07,984
Yes.

647
01:24:40,424 --> 01:24:41,755
Wow.

648
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,320
I...

649
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:51,596
You certainly had me fooled.
I... thought you were my dead husband.

650
01:25:01,479 --> 01:25:04,312
I thought you
were my dead husband.

651
01:25:07,084 --> 01:25:09,245
But you're just a little boy.

652
01:25:10,388 --> 01:25:12,083
In my bathtub.

653
01:25:57,501 --> 01:25:59,662
I never liked Sean.

654
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:37,131
What happened to me
was not my fault.

655
01:26:37,208 --> 01:26:40,473
There's no way I could've behaved
any differently, you know.

656
01:26:47,451 --> 01:26:51,114
What I did...
wasn't my fault.

657
01:26:57,728 --> 01:27:01,220
What happened to me
wasn't my fault,

658
01:27:01,298 --> 01:27:04,096
and I can't
be held accountable for it.

659
01:27:04,168 --> 01:27:06,932
There's no way I could ever
have said to him...

660
01:27:09,273 --> 01:27:10,604
"Go away."

661
01:27:11,709 --> 01:27:13,108
I couldn't do it.

662
01:27:20,718 --> 01:27:22,549
It was a mistake.

663
01:27:23,487 --> 01:27:27,821
And... I'm sorry.
I'm...

664
01:27:36,867 --> 01:27:38,596
But I wanna be with you.

665
01:27:41,772 --> 01:27:43,262
I wanna be with you.

666
01:27:45,276 --> 01:27:46,607
Yes, I do.

667
01:27:50,714 --> 01:27:52,705
And I wanna get married.

668
01:27:52,783 --> 01:27:54,045
And...

669
01:27:55,953 --> 01:27:59,354
I wanna have a good life,
and I wanna be happy.

670
01:28:05,229 --> 01:28:06,628
That's all I want.

671
01:28:08,732 --> 01:28:09,892
Peace.

672
01:28:23,747 --> 01:28:24,941
Okay.

673
01:28:35,059 --> 01:28:36,219
Thank you.

674
01:29:21,372 --> 01:29:22,839
Careful with the wire.

675
01:29:23,807 --> 01:29:25,638
And right here would be lovely.

676
01:29:27,645 --> 01:29:28,805
Okay.

677
01:29:30,848 --> 01:29:33,316
Lift up with your left foot.
There we are.

678
01:29:33,384 --> 01:29:35,113
Down.
Excellent.

679
01:29:35,185 --> 01:29:37,585
Okay. I'm gonna meter you.

680
01:29:40,024 --> 01:29:41,184
Okay.

681
01:29:43,093 --> 01:29:44,583
And close your eyes.

682
01:29:45,396 --> 01:29:46,556
Thank you.

683
01:29:48,165 --> 01:29:49,325
Excellent.

684
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,595
Okay, if you could look
right at me, please.

685
01:29:51,669 --> 01:29:53,569
And lift the bouquet.

686
01:29:53,637 --> 01:29:55,468
Just like that is fine.

687
01:29:58,275 --> 01:30:00,266
Lovely.
Look straight to me.

688
01:30:01,612 --> 01:30:02,806
Wonderful.

689
01:30:05,649 --> 01:30:07,549
Hold the bouquet up.

690
01:30:10,721 --> 01:30:12,052
Bouquet up, please.

691
01:30:17,194 --> 01:30:19,458
Anna? Bouquet up, please.

692
01:30:22,066 --> 01:30:23,226
Anna?

693
01:30:24,201 --> 01:30:26,692
Looks good.
Nice big smile. Excellent.

694
01:30:26,770 --> 01:30:29,762
<i>Dear Anna.
thanks for your letter.</i>

695
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,104
<i>Mom says thanks. too.</i>

696
01:30:32,176 --> 01:30:34,804
<i>I'm really happy
being back at my school.</i>

697
01:30:34,878 --> 01:30:39,747
<i>And my friends don't know
what happened. so it's okay.</i>

698
01:30:39,817 --> 01:30:41,978
<i>I don't go to your building anymore.</i>

699
01:30:42,052 --> 01:30:45,044
<i>And I've been seeing an expert.</i>

700
01:30:45,122 --> 01:30:47,283
<i>They sure talk a lot.</i>

701
01:30:47,358 --> 01:30:50,327
<i>They said I've been imagining things.</i>

702
01:30:50,394 --> 01:30:53,989
<i>Mom said maybe it was a spell.</i>

703
01:30:54,064 --> 01:30:56,897
<i>but it's a good thing
that it's gone away now.</i>

704
01:30:58,202 --> 01:31:01,194
<i>Tell everyone I'm sorry
I made a problem for them.</i>

705
01:31:02,172 --> 01:31:04,504
<i>And I'm really sorry I made you sad.</i>

706
01:31:05,609 --> 01:31:08,874
<i>They said they still haven't figured out
what was wrong with me.</i>

707
01:31:09,713 --> 01:31:14,548
<i>But they said the good thing is
that nothing really happened.</i>

708
01:31:15,953 --> 01:31:19,946
<i>Well. I guess I'll see you
in another lifetime.</i>

709
01:31:21,225 --> 01:31:22,385
<i>Sean.</i>

710
01:31:22,459 --> 01:31:24,188
Looks good.
And a big smile.

711
01:31:24,261 --> 01:31:26,195
That's a great smile.
Nicely done.

712
01:31:26,263 --> 01:31:28,288
Who's next, guys?
I'll take your card.

713
01:31:29,133 --> 01:31:30,293
Hands on your lap...
