1
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,316
- Move! Move it!
- Let´s go!

2
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:20,135
Jesus Christ!

3
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:31,144
Loomis!

4
00:05:21,562 --> 00:05:24,087
I need you to come with me.

5
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:26,099
Just a minute.

6
00:05:27,902 --> 00:05:30,700
It's Sophie.
Sophie thinks I have a mistress.

7
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:32,363
You´re worried about that?

8
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,466
lf you Iived with Sophie,
you'd understand.

9
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,273
Sometimes I yearn for our bacheIor days
in the army.

10
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:43,648
We were happy there, no?
WeII, l was happy! But you--

11
00:05:45,086 --> 00:05:47,316
I wonder if you´ve ever been happy.

12
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,448
No. It´s not Sophie
that worries me today.

13
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,252
Then what?

14
00:06:04,105 --> 00:06:07,131
- Who is he?
- l thought he was you.

15
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,373
EspecialIy when we couldn´t find you.

16
00:06:12,446 --> 00:06:16,348
Then one of my men toId me
you were at Major Lescourt´s funeraI.

17
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,853
I thought it was a sick joke.
I aImost fired him.

18
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,250
- But who is he?
- A good question.

19
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:32,462
Come on.
We are taIking to witnesses.

20
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:34,797
ApparentIy he was being chased.

21
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:39,363
There´s evidence he had been tortured.
His death was not an easy one.

22
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,408
Here´s the bag, sir.

23
00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:45,844
This was found
in the victim´s pockets.

24
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:49,110
These matches are from
the HoteI Chevre d´Or.

25
00:06:49,183 --> 00:06:51,651
- Our men are there now.
- Let´s go.

26
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:54,313
AIain, wait.
This is not your case.

27
00:06:54,388 --> 00:06:56,788
I'm not sure I want you invoIved
at this point.

28
00:06:56,857 --> 00:06:59,985
I am invoIved!
Did you see his face?

29
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,294
Are you coming or what?

30
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,772
Monsieur Suverov, thank God!

31
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:27,080
This man toId me you were kilIed
in a car accident.

32
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:30,351
- Good morning, sir.
- You onIy had your hair cut!

33
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,261
Yes. MikhaiI Suverov.

34
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,321
Now if you want access
to his room...

35
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,799
why don´t you ask Monsieur Suverov?

36
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:44,770
Good idea.
May we search your room, sir?

37
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,773
But of course.

38
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:52,678
I trust my map to the street
you asked for was satisfactory?

39
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:54,681
It was. Thank you.

40
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,980
- Did I get any messages?
- Oh, yes. A teIephone message.

41
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:03,613
AIex Bohemia.

42
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:07,457
Did he leave a number?

43
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,958
Thank you.

44
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:16,859
You heard that woman. This Suverov
must have been Iooking for me.

45
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:24,235
A stranger with your exact face...

46
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:27,769
and according to the passport,
your exact birth date...

47
00:08:27,848 --> 00:08:31,944
comes here and asks for directions
to the very street where you Iive.

48
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:34,453
A mystery, yes?

49
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:39,386
An airIine ticket
from Nice to New York...

50
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,860
and a New York driver's Iicense.

51
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:46,161
Some U.S. cash.

52
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:57,500
He was born five minutes after you.

53
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,306
I kept both of you for three months.

54
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,148
But I was sick.
I couIdn´t nurse.

55
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,314
There wasn´t even enough
for one of you.

56
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:14,955
I needed the money.
I had to do it.

57
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:22,295
TelI me now.
Why did you choose me?

58
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:26,931
I didn´t!
I didn´t have the courage.

59
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:29,168
Somebody eIse did it for me.

60
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:32,007
- Somebody else?
- A Iawyer from Paris.

61
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:35,913
He picked up your brother because...

62
00:09:35,983 --> 00:09:37,712
you were crying.

63
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:42,017
He saw my distress
and offered me money.

64
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,148
He said it was a good famiIy.

65
00:09:45,693 --> 00:09:47,354
Oh, God!

66
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,889
What have I done?

67
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,166
You survived.

68
00:10:04,245 --> 00:10:06,179
Made a home for me.

69
00:10:09,383 --> 00:10:14,514
You did what you had to do.
I don´t bIame you.

70
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:20,255
You should´ve toId me.

71
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:22,022
I know.

72
00:10:23,097 --> 00:10:26,032
Can you remember his name, the Iawyer?

73
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:28,867
Why?

74
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:32,167
Somebody kiIIed him, Mother.

75
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:35,675
He was trying to come home.
They kiIIed him.

76
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:40,277
AIain, pIease.

77
00:10:44,952 --> 00:10:46,943
Can you remember his name?

78
00:10:48,088 --> 00:10:49,783
Etienne St. Denis.

79
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:54,453
He had an office
in PIace PigaIle in Paris.

80
00:11:02,603 --> 00:11:05,367
Parents always Iie
to their chiIdren...

81
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:08,806
to prepare them for the way they´II
be treated later by the government.

82
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,071
Maybe I´m wasting my time.

83
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:15,639
But if I don´t go now,
I'Il regret it for the rest of my Iife.

84
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,480
What do you gain?
You onIy open old wounds.

85
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,816
The lawyer can´t bring him back.

86
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:26,155
My brother was adopted. If l can find
his famiIy, I can Iearn about him.

87
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,094
Kind of get to know him.

88
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:52,775
The Iawyer's office
is on the sixth fIoor.

89
00:11:52,853 --> 00:11:57,085
Remember, I´lI do the taIking. Okay?
And then seafood.

90
00:11:57,157 --> 00:11:59,887
Promise. Seafood before we go home.

91
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,168
Get out! Get out!

92
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:52,735
Go! Go!

93
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:57,348
The man in the eIevator!

94
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:00,284
Help!

95
00:13:00,354 --> 00:13:02,481
PIease heIp!

96
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:28,580
Help me!

97
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:53,099
Don´t hurt me!

98
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:57,768
The adoption papers are here.
My boss made me hide them.

99
00:13:57,845 --> 00:13:59,710
He wouId not give them to anybody.

100
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:03,416
Stay with me.

101
00:14:03,484 --> 00:14:05,247
You´II be safe.

102
00:14:10,858 --> 00:14:12,723
Come on, Iet´s go.

103
00:15:43,884 --> 00:15:45,215
My God!

104
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,315
Let´s go.

105
00:15:53,427 --> 00:15:55,224
Come on.

106
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:23,880
They´ve checked the entire fIoor.

107
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:26,551
There´s no one in there.
No body, nothing.

108
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:31,119
The secretary said a Russian guy showed
up, asked her boss a lot of questions.

109
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,793
Got upset with him.
Locked her in her room.

110
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:38,133
The next thing she knew,
the pIace was on fire.

111
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,366
Have you gone through
every piece of debris in the office?

112
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,533
- We´lI keep Iooking.
- Good.

113
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:46,808
He was adopted by a Russian famiIy.

114
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,112
The father was a Soviet dipIomat
who lived in Paris for five years...

115
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:54,642
and then immigrated
to America in 1968.

116
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:56,655
When´s the fIight?

117
00:16:56,723 --> 00:16:59,624
- What fIight?
- Mikhail´s flight to New York.

118
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:04,493
- I want his passport.
- No! You´re a cop. That´s evidence.

119
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,625
You think it was a coincidence
that guy was Russian?

120
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:10,169
Who knows what MikhaiI
was invoIved in.

121
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,932
Sebastien...

122
00:17:12,005 --> 00:17:15,065
what happened to my brother
couId´ve happened to me.

123
00:17:15,142 --> 00:17:20,079
Thirty-two years ago it was onIy Iuck
that kept me in France.

124
00:17:20,147 --> 00:17:22,672
He made a sacrifice
and never knew it.

125
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,810
I gotta go.

126
00:17:27,821 --> 00:17:32,258
The kiIler did not know MikhaiI is dead.
You go to New York with that face and--

127
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,585
Maybe he isn´t.

128
00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:53,502
WouId you Iike a vodka
before you sleep, Mr. Suverov?

129
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,174
- No, thank you.
- You´re weIcome.

130
00:18:20,907 --> 00:18:23,569
What you see before you
is caIIed gridIock.

131
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,544
- Next exit.
- Yeah, yeah.

132
00:18:25,612 --> 00:18:28,172
l´m writing the great American novel
here on the job.

133
00:18:28,248 --> 00:18:30,716
Literary kind of stuff.
Knock the filIings outta your teeth.

134
00:18:30,784 --> 00:18:33,014
Yeah. I see everything.

135
00:18:33,086 --> 00:18:36,749
That´s what it is. It´s aII about
Iooking around, observing stuff.

136
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:40,782
Take you, for instance.
Like that accent of yours.

137
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:45,093
What´s that? Don't teII me.
That´s European or something?

138
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,725
Bet you got a story to teII.

139
00:18:47,801 --> 00:18:50,326
This is Davis Hartley here.

140
00:18:50,404 --> 00:18:52,565
I´m not some nickeI and dime
street mutt.

141
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:55,574
I'm not trying to rip you off
or anything.

142
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:59,134
It wouId be stupid. A guy Iike you?
Got a coupIe pounds of Iead in his eyes?

143
00:18:59,212 --> 00:19:02,613
What´s that? Is that maybe grief
or something Iike that?

144
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,174
You want to taIk about it?

145
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:13,589
Maybe you think I´m trying to rip off
your experiences to put ´em in my noveI.

146
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,597
But that´s not true. Davis HartIey
is not some moraI cretin.

147
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:20,860
Not preciseIy.

148
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:22,925
I´m trying to make a point here.

149
00:19:23,003 --> 00:19:25,972
I'm a professionaI New York City
cab driver. You know what that means?

150
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,566
I´m the greatest individuaI at being
abIe to find anything in the worId.

151
00:19:29,643 --> 00:19:32,271
I couId find a penguin
in a sandstorm.

152
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:35,280
- l don´t know what a penguin would be--
- Stop taIking.

153
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:38,112
Please stop taIking!
HeIlo! Stop taIking!

154
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:43,521
You want to heIp? After l stop,
I'Il be busy for a whiIe.

155
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,558
Find a guy named...

156
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:47,991
AIex Bohemia.

157
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,298
Who do you think I am?
Do you think l´m a magician?

158
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:56,802
New York City is a big pIace.
How am I supposed to find AIex Bohemia?

159
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,966
Kind of Iike finding a penguin
in a sandstorm.

160
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,719
You sure you got the right address?

161
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,658
You boys think this is AtIantic City?

162
00:20:29,736 --> 00:20:32,671
Jeremy, pick up your miIk money
and get inside!

163
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,208
I´m sorry. I´m Iooking for--

164
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,970
You´re in the wrong neighborhood, man!

165
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:43,849
I´m Iooking for a famiIy.
Maybe--

166
00:20:45,485 --> 00:20:47,146
Wack accent!

167
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,246
You way out of your ´hood,
white boy.

168
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:52,314
You crazy or what?

169
00:20:52,392 --> 00:20:54,986
Or maybe you´re a cop?

170
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:58,121
Hey! Get the heII out from my building,
you littIe shits!

171
00:20:58,198 --> 00:21:00,666
Come on, oId man!
He's the chump.

172
00:21:03,937 --> 00:21:06,838
- Thank you.
- Chump.

173
00:21:08,675 --> 00:21:10,108
Thanks.

174
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:12,771
They´re not scared of you.
They don´t know who you are.

175
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,516
-They´re supposed to be scared?
-Everybody supposed to be scared of you.

176
00:21:17,584 --> 00:21:19,313
- Why?
- Why?

177
00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:23,720
PIease! Big-time gangster Iike you!
Rich.

178
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,985
I thought you forgot about us.

179
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:29,392
I haven't seen you here
in a Iong time.

180
00:21:30,797 --> 00:21:32,731
I´m not who you think I am.

181
00:21:36,002 --> 00:21:39,028
WeII, when his famiIy disappeared...

182
00:21:39,105 --> 00:21:41,198
there was a lot of rumors.

183
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:45,472
Some said they had gone back
to Russia.

184
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:48,878
Others said there was troubIe
with their grocery in LittIe Odessa.

185
00:21:48,949 --> 00:21:52,908
Russian mob controls everything
in LittIe Odessa.

186
00:21:52,986 --> 00:21:55,011
Maybe that´s why he joined them.

187
00:21:57,157 --> 00:22:01,594
- How oId was he?
- Sixteen. Forced to live on the street.

188
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:05,062
You gotta be strong to be a white boy
growing up in this neighborhood.

189
00:22:05,131 --> 00:22:07,122
Did he ever mention me?

190
00:22:23,617 --> 00:22:25,482
Your brother´s.

191
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,952
He kept it here alI these years.

192
00:22:32,158 --> 00:22:34,388
- Was he happy?
- Yeah.

193
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:39,421
The last l saw him, he had matured.
Got reaI serious.

194
00:22:42,702 --> 00:22:45,796
- But he had choices.
- What choices?

195
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:49,069
- He was aIone.
- I´d have taken him in.

196
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,439
He was a strange boy.

197
00:22:52,512 --> 00:22:55,208
You shouId go back to France.

198
00:22:55,282 --> 00:22:57,648
What you find here couId be ugly.

199
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,618
Did he ever mention someone
named AIex Bohemia?

200
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,662
But there´s a nightcIub in LittIe Odessa
caIIed the Bohemia.

201
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,845
Your vodka, Mr. Suverov.

202
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,186
Excuse me, I´m Iooking--

203
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:17,662
Mr. Suverov, you have a phone caII.
FoIIow me.

204
00:24:31,811 --> 00:24:33,244
MikhaiI.

205
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:44,750
Are you crazy? What the heII
are you thinking coming in here?

206
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:56,293
The key wasn´t in the maiIbox
'cause DarIene didn´t show up tonight...

207
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:59,031
so I don´t get a break
for another 20 minutes.

208
00:24:59,105 --> 00:25:00,436
Here.

209
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,935
You might as weII take it now.

210
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:10,410
You shouIdn´t have come!
You shouId´ve Iooked for the key Iater.

211
00:25:10,483 --> 00:25:13,782
What´s the matter?
You aII right?

212
00:25:13,853 --> 00:25:15,445
- Excuse me.
- AIex.

213
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:26,055
You probabIy gave haIf of those
bent-nose guys up there a heart attack.

214
00:25:26,132 --> 00:25:28,657
I´m surprised we weren´t trampIed
on the way to the phone.

215
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,163
You better get outta here.

216
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:36,098
I´II see you soon as I get off.

217
00:25:36,176 --> 00:25:39,475
Don't even think about going to sIeep.
We got a lot of catching up to do.

218
00:25:40,346 --> 00:25:42,974
Just teII me.
ls everything going to be okay?

219
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:47,009
Get outta here!

220
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,349
You need to go back inside.
Ivan wants to taIk to you.

221
00:26:24,424 --> 00:26:27,655
We were famiIy!
You betrayed us.

222
00:26:55,388 --> 00:26:56,650
Enough.

223
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:03,056
Enough!

224
00:27:09,135 --> 00:27:12,400
This is your Iucky day.

225
00:27:18,978 --> 00:27:20,445
Get in !

226
00:27:32,358 --> 00:27:34,952
That was dynamite.

227
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,861
Any of those guys AIex Bohemia?

228
00:27:37,931 --> 00:27:40,764
Good. I guess that wouId´ve been
structuraI Ietdown, huh?

229
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:42,767
You know this pIace?

230
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:45,599
Yeah. It's a fIeabag hoteI.

231
00:27:45,672 --> 00:27:48,436
They say that Bret Easton EIIis,
he got drunk...

232
00:27:48,508 --> 00:27:50,635
and he threw up in a fig tree.

233
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,440
The thing won´t stop growing.
They got to keep trimming it.

234
00:27:53,513 --> 00:27:55,777
- Just relax.
- He´s a very good writer.

235
00:27:55,848 --> 00:27:59,409
Just reIax. Thanks.

236
00:28:18,137 --> 00:28:21,629
- I´Il wait here for you.
- Thank you for your heIp.

237
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,801
Wait. We´re not done yet.

238
00:28:23,876 --> 00:28:27,573
We gotta find AIex.
My whoIe first chapter hangs on that.

239
00:28:27,647 --> 00:28:31,674
Go home and use your imagination
for chapter one.

240
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:55,837
Hi. Last time I was here
I stayed in room 323.

241
00:28:55,908 --> 00:29:00,038
Kind of a good Iuck thing.
It's avaiIabIe?

242
00:29:01,247 --> 00:29:04,375
Nope. But I got 305
across the haII.

243
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,108
That´s fine.

244
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:10,651
Sign.

245
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:27,105
Good evening, Mr. Dzasokhov.

246
00:29:27,173 --> 00:29:29,403
You´re a very pretty girI, AIex.
You know that?

247
00:29:29,475 --> 00:29:30,908
Thank you.

248
00:29:32,245 --> 00:29:35,339
WiII you do me a favor?
The band is too Ioud.

249
00:29:35,415 --> 00:29:37,815
It's a birthday party.

250
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:40,685
The band is too Ioud.

251
00:29:51,097 --> 00:29:52,826
Ten minutes, Yuri.

252
00:29:53,866 --> 00:29:55,891
Ten minutes.

253
00:29:55,968 --> 00:29:58,937
AlI l asked was that
you hoId MikhaiI...

254
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,565
for ten minutes.

255
00:30:01,641 --> 00:30:03,871
Is that a Iong time?

256
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,247
No. That is a very short time.

257
00:30:14,554 --> 00:30:16,886
How Iong can you hoId your breath?

258
00:30:24,597 --> 00:30:27,657
I know a felIow in Odessa once
who couId hold his breath...

259
00:30:27,734 --> 00:30:31,295
for five minutes, 33 seconds.

260
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,436
Did MikhaiI taIk to anyone
whiIe he was here?

261
00:30:38,511 --> 00:30:41,912
NichoIas, pIease.
The man is trying to speak.

262
00:30:55,695 --> 00:30:59,597
He was taIking...

263
00:30:59,665 --> 00:31:02,395
to her.

264
00:31:10,977 --> 00:31:14,071
So, what did you and Mikhail
taIk about?

265
00:31:15,014 --> 00:31:16,948
l toId him he had a phone caII.

266
00:31:18,851 --> 00:31:20,944
The caviar is fresh tonight.

267
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,921
Did l teII you
what a pretty girI you are?

268
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,185
Let me ask you something, sweetheart.

269
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:33,494
Do you have any idea what
wiII happen to you if you Iie to me?

270
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:36,501
I wilI never Iie to you.

271
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:39,868
Because if you Iie to me,
pretty girI...

272
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:44,565
you won´t be pretty anymore.

273
00:31:51,918 --> 00:31:53,852
Get back to work.

274
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,451
AII she needs is a good f--

275
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,877
What are you doing over there?

276
00:32:31,557 --> 00:32:33,491
Oh, MikhaiI, I missed you.

277
00:32:41,534 --> 00:32:44,332
You´re so tense.

278
00:32:44,403 --> 00:32:46,769
I'II heIp loosen you up.

279
00:32:54,647 --> 00:32:56,239
What´s this?

280
00:32:57,316 --> 00:33:00,114
You pIaying hard to get?

281
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,185
Is this a game?

282
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:11,355
Fine. Have it your way.

283
00:33:13,332 --> 00:33:15,459
But no handcuffs this time.

284
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:27,611
You´ve gotten a Iot harder
since you´ve been away.

285
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,450
Ivan was alI over me
after you Ieft tonight.

286
00:33:41,527 --> 00:33:44,223
He kept asking me stuff.

287
00:33:44,297 --> 00:33:48,097
Did l taIk to you?
What did I say?

288
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,764
He´s Iike something
that crawIs out of an oId pipe.

289
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,131
It's okay.

290
00:33:56,842 --> 00:34:00,744
ln a few days,
this wiII aII be behind us.

291
00:34:08,187 --> 00:34:11,987
Uh, l can´t do it.

292
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:17,961
I´m not MikhaiI.
He´s dead.

293
00:34:30,343 --> 00:34:32,174
Come here.

294
00:34:44,924 --> 00:34:46,221
Shit!

295
00:34:55,067 --> 00:34:58,525
Look, I´m positive the girI
went up to 323.

296
00:34:58,604 --> 00:35:00,868
The room is empty.
I was just up there.

297
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,340
You saw her come in.
When did she Ieave?

298
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:05,400
I don´t--

299
00:35:07,813 --> 00:35:10,304
Do you recognize this man?

300
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,176
Yeah. He checked in across the haII.

301
00:35:14,253 --> 00:35:18,690
- Room 305.
- Room 305. Okay, good. Let's go.

302
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,367
Found this.

303
00:35:37,443 --> 00:35:39,741
- Where did he go?
- I don´t know.

304
00:35:39,812 --> 00:35:41,370
Where did he go?

305
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,872
TeII me!

306
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,264
I want them dead!

307
00:36:05,638 --> 00:36:07,265
Down!

308
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,259
Come on !

309
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,595
HoId it!

310
00:37:12,037 --> 00:37:14,096
What are you--

311
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,739
Get in, get in, get in!

312
00:38:03,455 --> 00:38:04,547
Go!

313
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,767
Keep moving.

314
00:39:00,613 --> 00:39:02,046
Come on.

315
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:13,788
What´s wrong?
Are you okay?

316
00:39:37,149 --> 00:39:39,640
You were supposed to go home
and write.

317
00:39:41,487 --> 00:39:44,320
Who needs home?
I´m aIways working anyway.

318
00:39:46,692 --> 00:39:50,150
I guess we got
chapter one finished, huh?

319
00:39:52,364 --> 00:39:54,025
Oh, my God!

320
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:58,794
- Is this AIex? Alex Bohemia?
- Yeah.

321
00:40:00,005 --> 00:40:01,870
That's great.

322
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,000
Unexpected deveIopment.

323
00:40:05,077 --> 00:40:07,545
The whoIe thing´s so scary.

324
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:20,955
We gotta go! Come on.

325
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:33,771
Come on !

326
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:49,715
Zanzibar Club. Police state that
a man and woman were being pursued--

327
00:40:51,557 --> 00:40:53,525
He was in troubIe.

328
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,588
WouIdn´t admit it, though.

329
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,564
AIways said he had everything
under controI.

330
00:41:01,867 --> 00:41:03,926
That he had a Iot of money put away.

331
00:41:04,937 --> 00:41:06,871
Enough for a Iifetime.

332
00:41:08,941 --> 00:41:11,307
Said he had a pIan
that wouId get him out of the mob.

333
00:41:12,911 --> 00:41:16,278
I guess he was wrong.

334
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,282
They found him.

335
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,112
What did my brother mean to you?

336
00:41:27,459 --> 00:41:28,949
Everything.

337
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,692
Take me to his pIace.
l want to get to know him.

338
00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:38,203
Take you to his pIace?
Are you crazy?

339
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,738
You show up and start this mess
that aImost gets us kiIled.

340
00:41:40,806 --> 00:41:43,707
You don´t have a cIue
who you´re deaIing with, do you?

341
00:41:43,776 --> 00:41:46,472
If you wanna kiII yourseIf,
be my guest.

342
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,809
But who gave you the right
to risk my Iife?

343
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,816
l can't go home.
l can't go to work.

344
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:55,251
You painted a big red target
on my back.

345
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,485
Where´s the check?

346
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:29,152
MikhaiI used to say we could never stay
in one pIace too long.

347
00:42:29,221 --> 00:42:34,124
We have to move aII the time.
It´s time for us to move.

348
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,919
- They´II find us here.
- The cabbie didn´t have to die.

349
00:42:42,968 --> 00:42:47,029
This is just the beginning.
I've seen it before.

350
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,866
They won´t stop untiI you're dead, too.

351
00:42:59,351 --> 00:43:01,842
You can´t go to the poIice.
You can't hide.

352
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,684
Ivan and his boss, Kirov,
are reIentless.

353
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,029
AII right, I´II bring you
to your brother´s home.

354
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:33,049
This expIains why MikhaiI
picked a bank in Nice.

355
00:43:33,118 --> 00:43:35,211
HoIy shit.

356
00:43:35,287 --> 00:43:37,414
Looks Iike we got another chance.

357
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:40,788
How did he manage to hide
a twin brother from us?

358
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:45,262
Sir, MikhaiI never communicated
with him. If he had, we´d have known.

359
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:48,532
AII right.

360
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,593
WelI, in Iess than 56 hours that bank
in Nice opens the safe deposit box...

361
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:55,231
and we aIl read about ourseIves
in the ''New York Times.´´

362
00:43:55,307 --> 00:43:58,367
If that happens...

363
00:43:58,443 --> 00:44:01,571
we'Il be spending the rest of our Iives
wondering how we screwed up so badIy.

364
00:44:01,647 --> 00:44:04,377
Washington doesn´t
Iike federaI agents...

365
00:44:04,449 --> 00:44:06,713
working for the Russian mob.

366
00:44:06,785 --> 00:44:09,083
Our names are on that Iist.

367
00:44:12,324 --> 00:44:16,761
Get the brother.
Convince him to work with us in Nice.

368
00:44:16,828 --> 00:44:19,353
We don´t have any options.

369
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:22,157
We´II get him.

370
00:44:23,635 --> 00:44:29,267
And, guys, keep this one alive.
I doubt if they were tripIets.

371
00:44:32,511 --> 00:44:34,308
TripIets.

372
00:44:54,433 --> 00:44:56,594
AIex, what are you doing?

373
00:46:03,568 --> 00:46:05,001
Look at this mess.

374
00:46:53,452 --> 00:46:56,216
Maybe if you toId me what you´re
Iooking for, I couId heIp you find it.

375
00:46:57,489 --> 00:46:59,855
I wouIdn´t know what to teII you.
l´m just Iooking.

376
00:47:08,967 --> 00:47:10,696
What´d you find?

377
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,136
He knew about me.

378
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,206
What´d you do in the war?

379
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,747
Sniper.

380
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,194
Why wait five years to find me?

381
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:43,061
Jimmy! You in there?

382
00:47:44,202 --> 00:47:48,161
Open up, you shithead!
This stuff's hot!

383
00:48:02,287 --> 00:48:04,482
This is not your Iucky day.

384
00:48:10,362 --> 00:48:13,354
TeII your boss to Ieave me
the fuck aIone!

385
00:49:16,595 --> 00:49:20,554
Ivan, you Iook Iike your parrot died.

386
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:30,100
- MikhaiI´s back.
- Bring him to me.

387
00:49:34,746 --> 00:49:38,341
How can I bring him in when
l´ve got my hands tied behind my back?

388
00:49:40,485 --> 00:49:43,181
Let me deaI with him my own way.

389
00:49:43,255 --> 00:49:47,385
This is not a democracy.
You do what I say. You understand?

390
00:49:51,997 --> 00:49:55,023
Mikhail has caused no troubIe.

391
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,432
If FBl had Iist, beIieve me...

392
00:49:57,502 --> 00:50:00,630
we'd have major war with ItaIians,
with everyone.

393
00:50:00,705 --> 00:50:05,369
If he is here,
then Iist is stiIl in France.

394
00:50:05,443 --> 00:50:09,277
I wiII convince Mikhail
to take proper course of action.

395
00:50:09,347 --> 00:50:11,815
So, bring him to me.

396
00:50:12,651 --> 00:50:15,415
I meant no disrespect.
l´m just worried.

397
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:20,719
Remember when you toId me about Goradini
taIking to the FBI?

398
00:50:20,792 --> 00:50:23,556
And Pietro? And Andrea?

399
00:50:23,628 --> 00:50:27,564
I took care of them for you, Dimitri.

400
00:50:27,632 --> 00:50:30,100
But MikhaiI is different.

401
00:50:30,168 --> 00:50:32,932
I know you feeI Iike he´s your son.

402
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:41,974
Yes, Dimitri.

403
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:46,949
- ls fhis also Mikhail's place?
- No, my friend´s.

404
00:50:47,018 --> 00:50:50,351
Mikhail and l used fo come here
to escape.

405
00:50:51,556 --> 00:50:55,014
You Iooked comfortabIe with that gun
stuck in that guy's neck today.

406
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:59,363
That didn't scare me as much as when
you tried to drown him in the Jacuzzi.

407
00:51:02,968 --> 00:51:04,401
I Iost it.

408
00:51:04,469 --> 00:51:06,266
Sorry.

409
00:51:06,338 --> 00:51:09,671
How Iong you been working
at the Bohemia?

410
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:11,299
About a year.

411
00:51:12,377 --> 00:51:15,175
l used to dance.
NightcIubs.

412
00:51:16,314 --> 00:51:19,340
I make Iess money now,
but it's a IittIe more respectabIe.

413
00:51:30,862 --> 00:51:32,921
I doubt you´lI find anything here
of your brother´s.

414
00:51:36,368 --> 00:51:38,302
It´s worth trying.

415
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,604
What'd he do to make alI these peopIe
want to kiIl him?

416
00:51:49,014 --> 00:51:53,576
MikhaiI taIked about an insurance poIicy
or something that wouId keep him alive.

417
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:57,247
The FBl was folIowing him.

418
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,790
Pressuring him
to turn evidence on Kirov.

419
00:52:01,626 --> 00:52:04,220
You think those aren't enough reasons
to kiII him?

420
00:52:20,712 --> 00:52:23,146
The onIy time
my brother and I connected...

421
00:52:24,816 --> 00:52:27,580
was when he died.

422
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,582
We both Iost something.

423
00:52:47,505 --> 00:52:50,099
Rise and shine, boys and girIs.

424
00:52:54,112 --> 00:52:56,672
SpeciaI Agent PelIman, Loomis.

425
00:52:56,748 --> 00:52:58,181
FBI.

426
00:52:59,117 --> 00:53:00,607
How are you?

427
00:53:01,453 --> 00:53:05,287
Alex BartIett.
AIain Moreau.

428
00:53:05,356 --> 00:53:08,086
I beIieve we share mutuaI concerns.

429
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:13,390
We know you´re not Mikhail. We know
you're not part of the Russian mob.

430
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:17,565
That´s a first.
What do you want?

431
00:53:19,637 --> 00:53:21,628
We want to naiI the guys
that are trying to kiIl you.

432
00:53:22,674 --> 00:53:25,802
- And?
- WeII, MikhaiI kept a list.

433
00:53:25,877 --> 00:53:28,243
A detaiIed Iist...

434
00:53:28,313 --> 00:53:30,713
of peopIe, pIaces, events...

435
00:53:30,782 --> 00:53:34,218
which pretty much outIines
the entire Russian mob operation.

436
00:53:34,285 --> 00:53:37,049
Mikhail was working with us.

437
00:53:37,122 --> 00:53:39,682
He was heIping us with
our investigation of the Russian mob.

438
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:42,849
The fact is...

439
00:53:42,927 --> 00:53:46,021
your brother wanted to set things right,
wanted to set things straight.

440
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:49,157
He wanted to heIp us.
He was gonna give us the Iist...

441
00:53:50,201 --> 00:53:52,192
before he was kiIled.

442
00:53:53,805 --> 00:53:56,103
The Iist is in a safe deposit box
in a bank in Nice.

443
00:53:56,174 --> 00:53:58,642
What we want you to do
is come with us to the bank...

444
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:01,543
to Nice, and pretend--

445
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:04,673
- I´m MikhaiI.
- ExactIy.

446
00:54:04,749 --> 00:54:07,946
Exactly.
We knew you´d want to heIp.

447
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:27,561
But I don't.

448
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:30,297
Can you protect her from being kilIed?

449
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:34,641
Can you protect me?
You sure didn´t protect my brother.

450
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,080
Hey, paI...

451
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:39,446
we´re your onIy hope.

452
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,213
I´II take my chances.

453
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:47,590
Why don´t we try another approach, okay?

454
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,122
Move.

455
00:55:35,573 --> 00:55:38,804
l don´t understand. They´re the FBI.
They're supposed to heIp us.

456
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:41,675
At gunpoint, it´s not calIed heIp.

457
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,109
God, nothing makes sense. Who isn't
trying to kiII us at this point?

458
00:55:46,184 --> 00:55:49,517
When the FBl toId you MikhaiI
was working with them...

459
00:55:49,587 --> 00:55:51,521
you didn´t beIieve them, did you?

460
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:54,649
No way. He wouId´ve toId me.
I know he would´ve.

461
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:58,218
So they Iie!
They knew my brother was dead.

462
00:55:58,296 --> 00:56:02,562
The Russians didn´t know about it.
The Russians were pissed at me...

463
00:56:02,634 --> 00:56:05,694
but not surprised to see me alive.

464
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:10,969
- So if the Russians didn´t kiII him--
- FoIlow the Iist. Who eIse cares?

465
00:56:12,644 --> 00:56:14,077
The FBI.

466
00:56:15,146 --> 00:56:16,579
The FBl. Yeah.

467
00:56:23,054 --> 00:56:26,046
- Where are you going?
- To see Kirov.

468
00:56:26,124 --> 00:56:28,092
You can´t Ieave me here.
I'm coming with you.

469
00:56:32,664 --> 00:56:34,256
It´s too dangerous.

470
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:39,735
I can't beIieve this is happening again.
First MikhaiI and now you?

471
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,263
AIain, you´ve got
to Iet me come with you.

472
00:56:43,341 --> 00:56:46,071
We´re in this together, right?

473
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,872
AIex...

474
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:54,942
I promise you l´lI come back for you.

475
00:56:57,922 --> 00:57:00,015
I promise.

476
00:57:16,207 --> 00:57:18,732
Take me to Kirov.

477
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,243
Now.

478
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:41,125
Sit down.

479
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:46,762
Kirov asked me to bring him in.

480
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,412
I´m so sorry, Kirov!

481
00:58:10,428 --> 00:58:12,555
Don´t do it.

482
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:14,063
Back off.

483
00:58:20,238 --> 00:58:22,638
I came to taIk...

484
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:24,265
to Kirov.

485
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:27,468
Mikhail?

486
00:58:28,946 --> 00:58:30,709
No, you´re not MikhaiI.

487
00:58:30,782 --> 00:58:33,512
- Who are you?
- I´m his brother.

488
00:58:33,584 --> 00:58:37,987
If you´re brother,
where is MikhaiI?

489
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,785
He´s dead.

490
00:58:47,532 --> 00:58:50,000
I see I got your attention.

491
00:58:51,135 --> 00:58:54,002
- How did he die?
- You teII me.

492
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:58,168
I had nothing to do with his death.
And you don´t need your gun.

493
00:58:58,242 --> 00:59:01,177
- You´re safe here.
- Your peopIe tried to kilI me.

494
00:59:01,245 --> 00:59:03,839
- They thought I was MikhaiI.
- lmpossibIe!

495
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:06,816
I wanted to speak to him,
not kiIl him!

496
00:59:06,884 --> 00:59:10,479
To speak?
In what Ianguage?

497
00:59:10,555 --> 00:59:13,922
They tried to kiII me
and aImost succeeded.

498
00:59:25,536 --> 00:59:27,470
- Dimitri--
- Get out.

499
00:59:28,406 --> 00:59:30,340
- l just want--
- Get out!

500
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:47,123
Look after Ivan.

501
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,033
MikhaiI.

502
00:59:58,336 --> 01:00:00,531
l´m sorry.
What is your name?

503
01:00:02,507 --> 01:00:04,372
AIain.

504
01:00:04,442 --> 01:00:07,878
Come.
We need to taIk.

505
01:00:46,984 --> 01:00:49,009
Ivan and MikhaiI...

506
01:00:49,921 --> 01:00:52,651
they were Iike sons to me.

507
01:01:09,273 --> 01:01:11,264
I need a favor.

508
01:01:13,678 --> 01:01:16,112
I want to go back to Nice.

509
01:01:17,248 --> 01:01:18,681
Back home.

510
01:01:32,863 --> 01:01:34,296
Yes.

511
01:01:35,433 --> 01:01:38,095
l can heIp you.

512
01:01:38,169 --> 01:01:41,229
MikhaiI had Iist
in bank in Nice.

513
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,342
Get it for me.
We heIp each other, hmm?

514
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:03,390
Do it!
CaIl the poIice! Do it!

515
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:54,143
Go.

516
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:01,076
CaII an ambuIance.

517
01:04:28,606 --> 01:04:30,801
Watch it, buddy!

518
01:05:11,248 --> 01:05:13,546
The other side!
Get him!

519
01:06:16,747 --> 01:06:19,682
- Don´t move!
- Okay, Peter Pan.

520
01:06:21,085 --> 01:06:22,643
Spread ´em!

521
01:06:31,929 --> 01:06:33,988
Get in the car!

522
01:06:38,402 --> 01:06:40,370
Read him his rights.

523
01:07:12,369 --> 01:07:15,236
Did you know
l had a contract out on him?

524
01:07:15,306 --> 01:07:18,400
lf you weren´t protecting him,
he wouId be dead in his ceIl right now.

525
01:07:18,475 --> 01:07:22,809
The probIem with you, Ivan,
is that you don't think. You kiII.

526
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,644
- You´re not Kirov.
- What did you say?

527
01:07:29,954 --> 01:07:33,151
We need him to get the Iist, Ivan.

528
01:07:33,223 --> 01:07:36,886
- Why wouId he get you the Iist?
- Because you're gonna help make sure...

529
01:07:36,961 --> 01:07:39,657
he understands what happens
if he´s not a good boy in Nice.

530
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:41,163
Right?

531
01:07:42,066 --> 01:07:43,499
And after?

532
01:07:43,567 --> 01:07:45,797
We have 24 yours Ieft. Work with us
on this, and he´s aII yours.

533
01:07:45,869 --> 01:07:48,633
I don't care what you do with him.

534
01:07:48,706 --> 01:07:51,436
- Fine.
- Ivan, Iisten.

535
01:07:51,508 --> 01:07:53,840
We know you have an aIibi
for Kirov´s death.

536
01:07:53,911 --> 01:07:55,845
We aIso know
that you had him kiIled.

537
01:07:55,913 --> 01:07:58,609
So after this, Iet´s start fresh.
No more trouble. Is that okay with you?

538
01:07:58,682 --> 01:08:02,709
Listen to me.
l´m running things now, my way.

539
01:08:02,786 --> 01:08:06,779
And that girI knows too much.
She´s mine now.

540
01:08:14,565 --> 01:08:16,760
Step this way.

541
01:08:16,834 --> 01:08:18,893
You have visitors.

542
01:08:44,395 --> 01:08:48,195
So, I'm hoping a good night´s sleep
is aII you needed to see the Iight.

543
01:09:11,255 --> 01:09:13,120
You win.

544
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:34,039
In a few hours, we go bankin'.

545
01:09:34,111 --> 01:09:36,341
So try and get some rest.

546
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:50,183
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

547
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:53,696
Don´t worry about it. I checked it out.
Everything´s copacetic.

548
01:10:09,546 --> 01:10:11,810
So what´s the pIan?

549
01:10:11,882 --> 01:10:14,043
We gotta get out of here.

550
01:10:15,853 --> 01:10:17,286
No pIan.

551
01:10:18,455 --> 01:10:19,888
Nothing.

552
01:10:25,829 --> 01:10:28,059
Alain, about tomorrow.

553
01:10:28,132 --> 01:10:32,091
Tomorrow I reaIIy find out
who my brother was.

554
01:10:37,674 --> 01:10:40,006
They´re not gonna Iet us go...

555
01:10:40,077 --> 01:10:42,341
even when they get the Iist.

556
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:15,360
Monsieur Suverov.

557
01:13:15,432 --> 01:13:16,865

558
01:13:18,001 --> 01:13:20,697
If there´s anything I can do for you,
do not hesitate to make a request.

559
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:22,705
I think we´d Iike to go right in,
if that's okay.

560
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:25,037
I´m sorry.
Only Monsieur Suverov.

561
01:13:25,108 --> 01:13:27,440

565
01:13:55,272 --> 01:13:59,299
Unfortunately, we must go through
the identity protocoI again.

566
01:13:59,376 --> 01:14:00,809
Yeah, okay.

And the second name?

570
01:14:07,384 --> 01:14:09,443
AIain Moreau.

571
01:14:09,519 --> 01:14:12,454
- Your mother's Christian given name?
- ChantaI Moreau.

572
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:16,323
CIean and quiet.

573
01:14:24,401 --> 01:14:25,834
Here, monsieur.

574
01:14:27,904 --> 01:14:30,566
- Do you smoke?
- No, sir, I don´t.

575
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,404
- Can I get a cigarette?
- Of course, monsieur.

576
01:14:33,477 --> 01:14:36,207
And some gum.

577
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:38,372
- CertainIy.
- Thank you.

578
01:15:10,414 --> 01:15:12,348
I need access to my security box.

579
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:14,714
May I see your l.D.?

580
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:19,378
This is the one under the name
AIain Moreau.

581
01:15:54,324 --> 01:15:55,757
Monsieur.

582
01:16:01,064 --> 01:16:04,500
Only you could access this box.

583
01:16:04,568 --> 01:16:07,366
Therefore, one of two things
has happened.

584
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:11,237
We are fogefher again
as we should have been, a family.

585
01:16:11,308 --> 01:16:14,277
Or l´m dead,
and you shouldn´f trusf anyone.

586
01:16:15,812 --> 01:16:18,280

587
01:16:18,348 --> 01:16:21,784
Therefore, l´m leaving you a gift.
Your favorite.

588
01:16:21,852 --> 01:16:25,117
One of the boxes confains evidence
againsf governmenf agents...

589
01:16:25,188 --> 01:16:27,281
and the Russian mob.

01:16:27,357 --> 01:16:29,882
Hand it over to fhe American embassy.

591
01:16:35,365 --> 01:16:39,392
Alain, when l found ouf about you,
it was luck.

592
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:41,266
A newspaper.

593
01:16:41,338 --> 01:16:45,832
The moment l saw the picture,
l knew l had a brother in fhis world.

594
01:16:45,909 --> 01:16:49,572
You, my brother, reminded me
that l had a chance...

595
01:16:49,646 --> 01:16:52,376
and l decided to quit fhe mob.

596
01:16:52,449 --> 01:16:57,785
l didn´t confact you because everything
l fouched in my world turned fo poison.

597
01:16:57,854 --> 01:17:01,950
l´ve fried all fhese years
to leave my life behind, fo reunife us.

598
01:17:03,293 --> 01:17:06,023
l´m sorry if that never happens.

599
01:17:06,096 --> 01:17:08,030
Please forgive me.

600
01:17:08,098 --> 01:17:10,123
l want you to fell our mother...

601
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,896
that l don´f blame her
for what she did.

602
01:17:12,969 --> 01:17:15,904
The life l've lived
has taught me fhis.

603
01:17:15,972 --> 01:17:19,999
l only hope thaf we are lisfening
to this tape together.

604
01:17:20,076 --> 01:17:23,341
The money is for you and our mofher.

605
01:17:23,413 --> 01:17:27,042
You are my only friend.
God bless.

606
01:18:02,419 --> 01:18:05,820
Have everything in the small box
turned over to the American embassy.

607
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:09,456
- You understand?
- PerfectIy, sir.

608
01:18:57,407 --> 01:18:59,341
What´s going on?

609
01:19:15,592 --> 01:19:17,526
Sit down.
Just sit down.

610
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:35,534
Get the fuck out of here!

611
01:21:08,371 --> 01:21:10,601
- We´re clearing the building.
- Can´t Ieave without our guy.

612
01:21:10,673 --> 01:21:14,404
You can meet him outside. Everyone
is being cIeared to the street.

613
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:19,642
Don´t shoot.
I´m a cop.

614
01:21:19,716 --> 01:21:21,946
We´II see about that.

615
01:21:25,622 --> 01:21:27,556
Let's go. Come on.

616
01:22:20,543 --> 01:22:22,033
Sorry, sir.

617
01:22:23,947 --> 01:22:25,380
Let´s go.

618
01:22:42,966 --> 01:22:44,900
Put your hands
where we can see them...

619
01:22:44,968 --> 01:22:47,766
and step out of the van.

620
01:22:47,837 --> 01:22:49,270
SlowIy.

621
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,740
Keep your hands
where we can see them...

622
01:22:52,809 --> 01:22:55,107
and step out of the van.

623
01:22:56,079 --> 01:22:58,013
Back it up!

624
01:23:10,727 --> 01:23:12,160
Move!

625
01:23:48,965 --> 01:23:50,830
Get out!

626
01:23:55,705 --> 01:23:57,570
You move, you die.

627
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:43,885
Sebastien!

628
01:25:01,938 --> 01:25:04,372
Come on. Come on!

629
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:07,075
Come on. Move!

630
01:25:10,013 --> 01:25:11,446

631
01:25:11,514 --> 01:25:13,106
Get me out!

632
01:25:31,134 --> 01:25:33,329
Take a number.

633
01:25:39,275 --> 01:25:41,072
Come on.

634
01:25:41,144 --> 01:25:44,307
Don´t Ieave me.
PIease.

635
01:25:45,114 --> 01:25:47,378
I beg you!

636
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:49,645
Help me!

637
01:26:06,736 --> 01:26:09,830
- You okay?
- Yeah. Thank you.

638
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:17,976
The two men,
they took the girI with them.

639
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:19,639
That way.

640
01:26:42,672 --> 01:26:44,105
Don´t shoot.

641
01:26:44,173 --> 01:26:46,505
- Where´d they go?
- Down there.

642
01:27:14,971 --> 01:27:17,269
Need the car.

643
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:18,932
Sorry.

644
01:27:29,218 --> 01:27:31,311
Here he comes.
Comin´ up.

645
01:27:55,044 --> 01:27:58,172
- Look out! Look out!
- Shut up!

646
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:15,096
Watch that!

647
01:28:43,726 --> 01:28:46,251
Try that again and you´re dead.
You hear me?

648
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:35,676
Come on.

649
01:30:49,618 --> 01:30:51,415
Come on.

650
01:30:58,127 --> 01:31:00,357
I want you to Iisten to me now.

651
01:31:00,429 --> 01:31:02,659
I know you don´t have the Iist.

652
01:31:02,732 --> 01:31:05,394
But that doesn´t matter now. See?

653
01:31:06,669 --> 01:31:08,261
´Cause I want the money.

654
01:31:09,939 --> 01:31:13,033
I know you have Mikhail´s money,
and I want it.

655
01:31:13,909 --> 01:31:16,207
Why don´t you give it to me?

656
01:31:16,278 --> 01:31:18,212
And you waIk.

657
01:31:19,782 --> 01:31:21,716
Do we have a deal?

658
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:27,983
Do we have a deal?
I don´t think you get it, pal!

659
01:31:28,057 --> 01:31:31,220
I wiII kiIl her.
You understand me?

660
01:32:58,414 --> 01:33:01,076
The Americans are ecstatic
over MikhaiI´s evidence.

661
01:33:02,351 --> 01:33:05,377
They´ve made dozens of arrests.

662
01:33:05,454 --> 01:33:08,252
And thanks to his money,
you can afford to eat here.

663
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:12,418
HeIlo, AIain.

664
01:33:12,495 --> 01:33:14,690
Are you nervous,
Alex meeting your mother?

665
01:33:16,999 --> 01:33:18,557
l´m not nervous.

666
01:33:22,271 --> 01:33:23,704
Okay, I´m nervous.

667
01:33:26,475 --> 01:33:29,535
WeII, it's too late now.

668
01:33:36,986 --> 01:33:38,920
Wish me Iuck, okay?

669
01:33:47,263 --> 01:33:49,197
Do you feeI okay?

670
01:33:49,265 --> 01:33:52,826
Because it´s no reason to be nervous.

671
01:33:52,902 --> 01:33:55,029
l´m not nervous.

672
01:33:55,104 --> 01:33:56,537
Good.

673
01:33:59,775 --> 01:34:03,506
Let´s take a waIk.
It's nearby.

674
01:34:03,579 --> 01:34:06,139
It´s reIaxing.

675
01:34:07,349 --> 01:34:10,409
Okay, good. ´Cause I think one of us
needs to relax.

676
01:34:12,488 --> 01:34:15,252
Do you know what you will say?

677
01:34:16,625 --> 01:34:19,321
I´m not asking you to lie.

678
01:34:19,395 --> 01:34:21,454
l don´t need to Iie, Alain.

679
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:23,828
I´Il teII your mother the truth
about MikhaiI.

680
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:27,533
That he was...

681
01:34:27,603 --> 01:34:30,595
kind and generous.

682
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:32,973
Honest.

683
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:40,014
Just Iike his brother.

684
