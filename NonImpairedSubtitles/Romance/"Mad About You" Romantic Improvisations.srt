1
00:00:41,654 --> 00:00:44,919
What could you possibly have
in your nose I don't have?

2
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:48,757
- Oh, was I snoring?
- I can't believe you're alive.

3
00:00:48,828 --> 00:00:52,821
Oh, God, I dreamt we were really
good friends with Dean Martin.

4
00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:57,267
It's 6.45 on a completely gross
Friday morning in New York.

5
00:00:57,336 --> 00:00:58,462
The Lincoln Tunnel is--

6
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:02,904
Why do we let this man
in our bedroom?

7
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:05,409
Can you run the shower
and make the coffee?

8
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,938
I think I'm pregnant.

9
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:12,083
Just kidding.

10
00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:15,250
Make the coffee.

11
00:01:29,402 --> 00:01:31,495
Tell me why

12
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:33,402
I love you like I do

13
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:35,100
Tell me who

14
00:01:35,174 --> 00:01:37,665
Can start my heart as much as you

15
00:01:37,743 --> 00:01:41,509
Tell me all your secrets
and I'll tell you most of mine

16
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:45,540
They say nobody's perfect
Well, that's really true this time

17
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:47,586
I don't have the answers

18
00:01:47,653 --> 00:01:49,484
I don't have a plan

19
00:01:49,555 --> 00:01:51,489
But I'm mad about you, baby

20
00:01:51,557 --> 00:01:53,422
So help me understand

21
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:54,926
What we do

22
00:01:54,994 --> 00:01:57,087
You can whisper in myear

23
00:01:57,163 --> 00:01:58,926
Where we go

24
00:01:58,998 --> 00:02:01,262
Who knows what happens after here

25
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:03,234
Let's take each other's hand

26
00:02:03,302 --> 00:02:07,432
As we jump into
the final frontier

27
00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:10,271
I'm mad about you, baby

28
00:02:10,343 --> 00:02:12,038
Yeah

29
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:14,477
I'm mad about you

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,692
- Honey, we're leaving in five seconds.
- You're not waiting for me.

31
00:02:29,762 --> 00:02:32,856
If we're not on the subway by 8:00,
all the non-sticky seats are taken.

32
00:02:32,932 --> 00:02:34,991
Listen, you don't have to pick up
the dry cleaning today.

33
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:37,001
- Okay. How come?
- 'Cause I never took it in.

34
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:39,503
It's still sitting
in a shopping bag under my desk.

35
00:02:39,572 --> 00:02:41,540
- In your office?
- I forgot it.

36
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:44,576
Honey, people walk by there--
strangers.

37
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:48,136
You know, they look underyour desk,
and they see my soiled garments?

38
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:50,808
They're not on display.
They're under my desk.

39
00:02:50,883 --> 00:02:53,943
You know what I'm saying. Somebody drops
a pencil, it rolls underyour desk.

40
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,150
Next thing, some guy is walking around
with my pants on his head, you know.

41
00:02:58,224 --> 00:03:00,920
How good could I feel
about something like that?

42
00:03:00,993 --> 00:03:04,656
It doesn't bother you that
we haven't had sex in five days?

43
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,958
Hello.

44
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,434
I just don't understand
why it doesn't bother you.

45
00:03:09,502 --> 00:03:12,198
- It's been almost a week.
- It's not a week.

46
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:14,865
Sunday will be a week.
What's going on with us?

47
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:19,173
What's going on is that we're married
five months and the sexual part is over.

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,974
See, I thought you understood that.
I'm sorry. That's what happens now.

49
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:28,919
I play checkers in the park,
and you start arguing with buses.

50
00:03:28,988 --> 00:03:30,979
- Come on.
- It's not funny.

51
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:34,185
- You serious?
- I'm very serious. What's going on?

52
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,855
Nothing is going on.
It's just-- Stuff happens.

53
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,388
- What stuff?
- Life stuff. My life. Your life.

54
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:43,799
Look, Monday I was editing film
until 2:00 in the morning...

55
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:46,337
and then Tuesday
you had the conference thing.

56
00:03:46,405 --> 00:03:49,067
And then we saw my parents,
which, you know...

57
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:54,808
killed the mood Wednesday and
sucked the life out of me Thursday.

58
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:58,877
So there you go.
There's your week right there.

59
00:03:58,951 --> 00:04:01,784
What can I say?
I'm a woman. I have needs.

60
00:04:01,854 --> 00:04:03,287
- I understand.
- I'm young.

61
00:04:03,356 --> 00:04:04,948
- No one's arguing.
- I'm vital.

62
00:04:05,024 --> 00:04:07,458
- And beautiful.
- Are my ears too big for my head?

63
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:09,460
- And very neurotic.
- No, seriously.

64
00:04:09,528 --> 00:04:11,928
- Is my head getting smaller?
- I didn't want to say anything...

65
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:14,694
- but yes, and for some time now.
- Stop.

66
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:18,066
Listen, tonight,
can wejust do nothing?

67
00:04:18,137 --> 00:04:20,071
- Really?
- Really.

68
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:23,302
- Don't toy with me, white boy.
- I'm serious.

69
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:28,473
Tonight, we'll both come home early,
and, you know, we'll have dinner.

70
00:04:28,547 --> 00:04:32,608
And sex. I really think
we should have sex.

71
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:36,451
Can I please finish?
We have dinner at 7:00.

72
00:04:36,522 --> 00:04:38,649
Figure foreplay, 8:1 5.

73
00:04:38,724 --> 00:04:42,125
Ifwe're naked at 8:30,
we're wheezing and sweating at 9:00.

74
00:04:43,562 --> 00:04:45,086
- Perfect.
- All right.

75
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:47,291
- I'm gonna make lasagne.
- Ooh, you could do that?

76
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:51,598
Well, I can try. We can open that
nice wine we got from Fran and Mark.

77
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:53,263
- Oh, no.
- What?

78
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:55,830
Fran and Mark. We're having
dinner with Fran and Mark.

79
00:04:55,908 --> 00:04:57,842
- What are you talking about?
- We have plans.

80
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,741
- I had no knowledge ofthis.
- Yes, you did.

81
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:02,612
When?
You never said anything.

82
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:04,616
Last Friday,
as we left the apartment...

83
00:05:04,684 --> 00:05:06,447
you said,
"What are we doing for dinner?"

84
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:10,353
I said, "We have no plans, but the next
Friday we're seeing Fran and Mark."

85
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:16,485
- What?
- You were out oftown last Friday.

86
00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:19,190
Damn it.

87
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:21,927
- But a nice try. That was real good.
- So what are we gonna do?

88
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:24,697
- We blow 'em off.
- We're always cancelling on them.

89
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,398
- Yeah, 'cause we don't like them.
- But they're such good friends.

90
00:05:27,473 --> 00:05:30,101
J ust call Fran,
tell her that we can't do it.

91
00:05:30,176 --> 00:05:33,805
- You call her.
- You should. She's your friend.

92
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:36,473
Can wejust discuss it
in the elevator, please?

93
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:42,346
- What is it now?
- I have to open the window for the dog.

94
00:05:42,421 --> 00:05:45,948
Honey, it's an apartment, not a Volvo.
Why do we go through this?

95
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:50,155
Because the kid who walks him can't get
up here till 3:00, and the heat's on.

96
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:51,662
Yeah, but--

97
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:00,730
A burglar is not gonna climb up
1 1 stories.

98
00:06:00,806 --> 00:06:03,274
Cat burglars. That's all they do.
They climb and they steal.

99
00:06:03,342 --> 00:06:05,742
Oh, honey, come on. Ifyou're
not out of here in two seconds...

100
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:08,837
I'm moving all your clothes around.

101
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,182
- Who says I don't like your outfit?
- You don't.

102
00:06:13,252 --> 00:06:16,881
I love your outfit!
Oh, you're out ofyour mind.

103
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:25,322
See, this is whyyou guys
are so good together.

104
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:26,365
Why?

105
00:06:26,432 --> 00:06:29,458
Because you make time for each other.
Mom and Dad never did that.

106
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:33,695
- Does this look like enough to you?
- Well, I'm not that hungry.

107
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:36,968
Oh, did you want to stay?

108
00:06:38,444 --> 00:06:41,777
No. I'm not gonna interfere
with your date.

109
00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:43,906
Besides, I already have plans.

110
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:45,610
Anything good?

111
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:46,912
I'm gonna wallow.

112
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:48,317
Why?

113
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:50,514
'Cause you got the husband
and the good hair.

114
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:52,614
Stop it.

115
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:56,388
I broke up with Arthur,
that creep from Fort Lee.

116
00:06:56,462 --> 00:06:59,363
Oh, the one who looks
like William Devane?

117
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:03,027
Willem Dafoe. William Devane?
Who am I ? Mom?

118
00:07:03,102 --> 00:07:06,765
- What happened?
- I don't even want to talk about it.

119
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,240
- He doesn't want to get married again.
- So? Neither do you.

120
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:14,643
But he doesn't even want to date.
He says he likes me too much to date.

121
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:17,682
He likes you too much to date?
Where do you meet these people?

122
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,947
Hey, that's what's out there.
Trust me, you married the perfect guy.

123
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,114
Oh, yeah, unless you're
sitting in a restaurant...

124
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,385
starving to death,
waiting to order.

125
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:28,893
"I'm thinking soup, but...

126
00:07:33,132 --> 00:07:35,896
they only have bisque,
and I'm uneasy with bisque.

127
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:37,128
I don't know why."

128
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,133
Believe me, nothing's perfect.

129
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:48,306
Oops.

130
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,177
You're gonna serve that now?

131
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:55,186
No, not till about 7:00.

132
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:59,284
Ooh, look, a cute girl.

133
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:03,255
- Look at you guys.
- Lisa.

134
00:08:04,797 --> 00:08:07,197
- Don't worry. I'm not staying.
- What?

135
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:10,292
- I'm not staying.
- Sure. Whatever.

136
00:08:10,369 --> 00:08:14,897
How's everything? Good?
How's the guy from Fort Lee?

137
00:08:14,974 --> 00:08:17,841
More importantly,
how is the new car running? Good?

138
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,277
They stole my stereo
and slashed the seats.

139
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:22,837
- No!
- Where?

140
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:25,884
I was at Roosevelt Hospital
the night I had my panic attack.

141
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:28,078
Yeah, but you're insured, right?

142
00:08:28,153 --> 00:08:30,451
I forgot to send in my premium.

143
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:33,492
Hey, who needs insurance as long
as you got your health, right?

144
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:39,426
And I'm getting my period... again.

145
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,458
Oh, look what happened here!

146
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:45,663
Would you excuse me
for one minute?

147
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,109
- That was subtle. What?
- "What?"

148
00:08:51,176 --> 00:08:54,873
What is she doing here? We're supposed
to have foreplay in 1 1 minutes.

149
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:57,782
Shejust got dumped.
She's so depressed.

150
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,909
Lisa? Depressed? Really?

151
00:08:59,985 --> 00:09:02,078
What was I supposed to do?
Not let her come over?

152
00:09:02,154 --> 00:09:05,521
If I walked in here tonight with Selby,
you would've gone nuts.

153
00:09:05,591 --> 00:09:07,752
- Well, that's different.
- Why is that different?

154
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:11,592
Because she's my sister, and he's
over here every night ofour life.

155
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:15,896
And she's not, right? You know,
tonight was supposed to be you and me.

156
00:09:15,968 --> 00:09:17,230
That was the whole purpose.

157
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:20,067
If it means that much to you, I'll
ask her to leave. Who are you calling?

158
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:22,835
- Selby, what's up?
- Don't you dare.

159
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:25,900
Lasagne. Is it vegetarian?
'Cause he won't eat that.

160
00:09:26,979 --> 00:09:28,947
If he comes over,
I'm walking out of here.

161
00:09:29,014 --> 00:09:31,676
- Why would she mind?
- I'll go out with my sister.

162
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,217
Where? To do what?

163
00:09:33,285 --> 00:09:35,845
Wherever to do whatever I want.

164
00:09:35,921 --> 00:09:38,151
See you when you get here.
Great.

165
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:43,653
- Well, so much for our evening alone.
- It don't look too good right now.

166
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:46,960
Why don't you just marry Selby?
You'll probably be a lot happier.

167
00:09:47,032 --> 00:09:49,626
Hey, send your sister home.
I'll call offSelby right now.

168
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:51,169
You are so cruel.

169
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:54,694
I'm cruel? That's interesting.
I'm cruel.

170
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:01,972
- Tell me that you called Fran and Mark.
- You said you were gonna call.

171
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:03,344
- I did. You said--
- Forget it!

172
00:10:03,415 --> 00:10:06,009
Don't tell me to forget it.
Who invites them?

173
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:08,485
- That's not the point.
- Who complains that we're never alone?

174
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:12,046
Well, I changed my mind. I don't even
want to have a relationship with you.

175
00:10:12,124 --> 00:10:14,092
- Oh, that's very nice.
- Hi!

176
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:26,364
Honey, sweetie,
can I say something?

177
00:10:26,438 --> 00:10:28,906
Flat isn't always more.

178
00:10:31,143 --> 00:10:32,667
We're gonna have enough.

179
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:34,770
The only one who's gonna eat
is Selby, you know.

180
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:36,815
I had a big lunch,
and Lisa's dieting...

181
00:10:36,882 --> 00:10:38,873
and Mark and Fran
are gonna split a piece.

182
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:40,885
And you're not gonna eat
'cause you're mad.

183
00:10:40,953 --> 00:10:42,682
I'm not mad.

184
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:46,787
I feel like I should go home
and change clothes.

185
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:49,487
- I didn't know you were having guests.
- Well, neither did we.

186
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:53,196
- Are you guys fighting?
- This is just how we live.

187
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:55,790
Don't mind me.
I just need ice.

188
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:59,133
Maybe you could chip some
off my wife's mood. Ow!

189
00:10:59,204 --> 00:11:02,332
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- You have no ice?

190
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:04,467
That's the one thing
I asked you to do.

191
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:08,343
Selby said that
he's bringing the ice.

192
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:11,577
- Well, Selby isn't here yet.
- Yes, he is. Hejust walked in.

193
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,743
And he's already
torturing my husband.

194
00:11:15,654 --> 00:11:17,519
- Seriously.
- What?

195
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:20,353
- How often you cheat on Fran?
- What?

196
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,661
Come on. You could tell me.
Man to man.

197
00:11:23,729 --> 00:11:25,458
What kind ofa question is that?

198
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:29,092
- Is Fran still seeing that transit cop?
- What?

199
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:32,729
- Come on. Come here.
- I'll be back.

200
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:34,295
What's going on?

201
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:36,637
I told you to bring ice,
but you forgot it in the cab.

202
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:38,643
Got it.

203
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:41,646
How do you forget ice in a cab?

204
00:11:41,714 --> 00:11:44,182
I don't know.
I'm such a jerk.

205
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:48,413
The driver, he had one ofthose
little coolers in the front seat.

206
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:51,684
I asked him to keep it up there
for me so it wouldn't melt.

207
00:11:51,757 --> 00:11:53,281
Like a dope, I forgot.

208
00:11:53,358 --> 00:11:56,259
You guys are like
the Abbott and Costello of liars.

209
00:11:59,598 --> 00:12:01,532
- She's tough.
- Very tough.

210
00:12:02,901 --> 00:12:05,995
Hey, looks like
the party's in here.

211
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:09,737
I love this.
This always happens.

212
00:12:09,808 --> 00:12:12,333
Why do people
congregate in the kitchen?

213
00:12:12,411 --> 00:12:14,436
Know why?
'Cause nobody wants to say...

214
00:12:14,513 --> 00:12:17,414
"Get out so I could fight
with my spouse in private."

215
00:12:18,784 --> 00:12:21,480
- I got the cheese.
- I have a plate.

216
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:32,697
Mark, could you bring these
inside, please?

217
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,325
No problem.

218
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:42,028
- Come on, let's start the salad.
- Fran, Paul and I need a second.

219
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,570
Oh. Are you okay?

220
00:12:44,643 --> 00:12:46,543
- Mm-hmm.
- Is everything all right?

221
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:51,079
Can I help?

222
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,648
Give these to Mark.

223
00:12:55,354 --> 00:12:56,480
He knows where they go?

224
00:12:56,555 --> 00:12:58,921
Yes. Yes, he does.

225
00:13:06,031 --> 00:13:09,228
I'm definitely gonna call them
if I ever move.

226
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:11,701
- Ifyou move?
- What?

227
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,261
No. Sorry. We.
Ifwe move, okay?

228
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,307
Kill me 'cause I said "I"
instead of"we."

229
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:20,641
You know why I said that? 'Cause
subliminally that means I hate you.

230
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:24,409
- There's a magnet in the thing.
- I don't know why this is all so hard!

231
00:13:24,483 --> 00:13:26,474
- What?
- This! Everything! Marriage!

232
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:28,383
It's supposed to be different
than this.

233
00:13:28,453 --> 00:13:30,512
- Says who?
- Everyone.

234
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:33,581
Well, they're wrong.
It's just like this.

235
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:36,184
- It's exactly like this.
- According to who?

236
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:37,888
Everybody. I asked around.

237
00:13:39,498 --> 00:13:42,831
Look, there's always
gonna be stuff, you know.

238
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:45,870
But I put up with your crap,
and you put up with my crap.

239
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:48,736
- That's marriage?
- This is what I'm thinking.

240
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,368
Great.

241
00:13:52,444 --> 00:13:55,140
Look, all I know is
that ifwe keep this up...

242
00:13:55,214 --> 00:13:56,647
we're gonna die...

243
00:13:56,715 --> 00:13:59,582
'cause I'm either gonna burst into
flames or I'm gonna strangle you.

244
00:13:59,651 --> 00:14:02,814
- I really don't want to do either one.
- What do you want?

245
00:14:02,888 --> 00:14:05,823
I just want to be married to you.

246
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,494
What ifthis lasagne sucks?

247
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,860
What if it doesn't?

248
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:17,532
What ifthey come--

249
00:14:22,374 --> 00:14:23,807
- More.
- Come here.

250
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:31,913
There's people out there.

251
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:35,078
They got enough chips
to keep them occupied.

252
00:14:37,422 --> 00:14:39,754
- Come here.
- What are you doing?

253
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:42,157
- Come here.
- Hey.

254
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:48,397
There's people out there.

255
00:14:52,838 --> 00:14:56,740
Nobody come in here for a while.
It's a big surprise.

256
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,145
You don't scare me.

257
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:14,455
Listen, what do you think
the surprise is?

258
00:15:14,526 --> 00:15:16,926
Well, you see, I know what it is,
but I can't tell you.

259
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:19,964
- You know? What? They told you?
- Mark, please.

260
00:15:20,032 --> 00:15:21,693
No, who told you? Paul?

261
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:24,395
Come on, you're making me
uncomfortable here.

262
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:30,700
You think this makes me
a bad hostess?

263
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:32,641
Not at all.

264
00:15:32,711 --> 00:15:34,838
Can you imagine if Fran walked in?

265
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:37,381
Honey, Fran is not the image
I need right now.

266
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:39,314
Sorry.

267
00:15:39,384 --> 00:15:42,114
It's probably a big deal
over nothing.

268
00:15:42,187 --> 00:15:46,351
The first few times we had people over,
the littlest things can set you off.

269
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:49,986
If I told you I once cried
because I didn't have a gravy boat...

270
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:51,461
would you believe me?

271
00:15:53,398 --> 00:15:55,525
Are you sureJamie
does it like that?

272
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,537
'Cause the last time we were here,
the silver was next to the plates.

273
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:03,267
Shejust switched
to this method last week.

274
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,455
There's a very sharp corner
digging right in my thigh.

275
00:16:18,523 --> 00:16:21,048
Our next table
has to be a king.

276
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,191
They're probably baking. Fran?

277
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:32,663
I'm not sure.

278
00:16:33,805 --> 00:16:35,739
I've heard baking before.

279
00:16:35,807 --> 00:16:38,776
It doesn't sound like that.
Fran?

280
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:42,313
Oh, ofcourse!
My birthday two weeks ago.

281
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:46,147
Ifshe is baking me a cake,
I will absolutely kill her.

282
00:16:48,153 --> 00:16:51,418
Fran, you can't go in there.

283
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:54,288
Are you two okay?

284
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:06,236
You know, speed is usually considered
a bad thing in this event.

285
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:10,666
This is the most fun we've ever had
with Fran and Mark here.

286
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:17,244
This was great.
We have to do it again, and soon.

287
00:17:17,315 --> 00:17:19,249
Well, soon as humanly possible.

288
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:23,549
- Oh, we're going on a cruise.
- That's wonderful. Where? When?

289
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:25,954
End ofthe month.
Puerto Vallarta. Eight days.

290
00:17:26,024 --> 00:17:27,548
- Oh, that's nice.
- Fellow in my office went.

291
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:29,958
Said it was fantastic.

292
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:32,360
The food, the weather, unbelievable.
You guys should come with us.

293
00:17:33,331 --> 00:17:35,891
- No, we couldn't.
- No, don't be silly.

294
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:40,336
We'd love it. It'd be nice
to have the company. Fran?

295
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:44,171
More company. For the two of us.
For both of us.

296
00:17:44,242 --> 00:17:47,040
Two couples.
We can go as two couples.

297
00:17:47,112 --> 00:17:49,808
Okay, you misunderstood me.

298
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:53,578
Because they can'tjust pack up
and leave right away, right?

299
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:55,677
You know, that's funny
because we can.

300
00:17:55,754 --> 00:17:58,052
The end ofthe month
is perfect for us.

301
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,552
You get yourself into these things.
We're going alone.

302
00:18:05,831 --> 00:18:08,664
We're gonna go alone, because
I think it's romantic that way.

303
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:11,668
We were looking forward,
but I understand.

304
00:18:11,736 --> 00:18:14,933
- Okay, I'm going.
- Would you please take a cab?

305
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:18,601
- Come on. The subway's faster.
- The subway is full ofdegenerates.

306
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:21,145
Well, how am I gonna meet
anyone if I take a cab?

307
00:18:22,247 --> 00:18:24,807
- We're putting her in a cab.
- No, no, no.

308
00:18:37,996 --> 00:18:40,021
Gee, is it 1 1 :1 5 already?

309
00:18:40,098 --> 00:18:43,067
Oh, yeah.
Oh, well, go to bed.

310
00:18:44,836 --> 00:18:47,930
- Thanks for dinner, Selby.
- Don't mention it.

311
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:50,836
Can you believe this?

312
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:53,776
How can they not realize
that Clark Kent is Superman?

313
00:18:53,845 --> 00:18:56,279
These people are reporters.

314
00:18:56,348 --> 00:18:58,282
What's going on tomorrow?

315
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,682
Oh, I think I'm supposed
to go out with that girl Dora.

316
00:19:00,752 --> 00:19:03,152
- The dancer?
- Unbelievable legs.

317
00:19:03,221 --> 00:19:04,779
- Ouch.
- Very muscular.

318
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:06,790
- Whyyou gotta hurt me?
- Got a sister too.

319
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:09,588
- Stop it.
- Honey, you coming to bed?

320
00:19:10,495 --> 00:19:13,896
Man, it's like a work whistle.

321
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:16,627
It's very easy
to make fun, isn't it?

322
00:19:16,701 --> 00:19:18,191
Let me tell you something.

323
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,034
Somedayyou are gonna hear
a voicejust like that.

324
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:23,040
And amazingly enough,
you are gonna say...

325
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:25,167
"I n a second, sweetie."

326
00:19:25,243 --> 00:19:29,043
And you, too, will shove your best
friend out the door and go to bed.

327
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:32,345
You sure you don't want
to do something?

328
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,990
I love chest hair.

329
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:43,789
Hey, what you have there
is plenty good.

330
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:46,558
No point in us both
having the same thing.

331
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:50,059
I think my sister knew.

332
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:52,433
- Yeah, I think Selby knew.
- How?

333
00:19:52,504 --> 00:19:54,301
- I told him.
- What?

334
00:19:54,372 --> 00:19:57,273
No guy does that
without telling somebody.

335
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:03,774
I guess we haven't lost
the magic, huh?

336
00:20:03,848 --> 00:20:07,079
- Well, for tonight we have.
- You know what I mean.

337
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:11,521
See, now I'm afraid you might be
out ofthings to worry about.

338
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:16,527
- I love you.
- I love you more.

339
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:36,843
Are we having Thanksgiving
with your parents or mine?

340
00:20:36,915 --> 00:20:39,509
I thought I'd just come visit you
at the institution.
