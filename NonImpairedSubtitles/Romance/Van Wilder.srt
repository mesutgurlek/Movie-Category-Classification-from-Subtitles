1
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:46,177
Coolidge College
was established in 18--

2
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,770
Who knows this?
It was in your freshman facts.

3
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,340
The first day of spring semester.

4
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,511
A time to say good-bye
to the parents once again...

5
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,613
and say hello
to a few new student bodies.

6
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,020
As for me, well...

7
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:07,361
I like to start off each semester
with a certain time-honored tradition.

8
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,833
A ritual, if you will,
that allows me...

9
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:12,200
to get my head in the right place.

10
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:21,269
Okay, so Suk Mee's a little old...

11
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:25,109
but she is just so damn good.

12
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,652
She's great with these quick jobs...

13
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,884
plus there is no substitute
for decades of experience.

14
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,722
That looks amazing.

15
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,055
That is perfect. You're a pro.

16
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,564
A pro.

17
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,232
Look at me.

18
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,633
Pro.

19
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,771
Well, gosh, that was great.
Thanks for the quick job there.

20
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,344
I need these in 20 minutes.

21
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,179
Super.

22
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,367
We've got a jumper!

23
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,384
Hold on, son.
You don't want to do this.

24
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:38,014
I didn't want to come here either.
They made me come!

25
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,648
They made me!

26
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,627
First year can be kind of scary,
can't it, Timmy?

27
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,256
My name's not--

28
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,632
But you know what I've learned
in my seven years here at Coolidge...

29
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,295
Timmy?

30
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,499
I've learned that you can't treat every
situation as a life-and-death matter...

31
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,473
because you'll die
a lot of times.

32
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,574
Write that down.

33
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,241
- I don't have a pen.
- Well, remember that then.

34
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,750
And you know something, Timmy?

35
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,250
I think you've got the balls
to make it here.

36
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,257
Call me nuts...

37
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,427
but I believe in you.

38
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,992
You see, Timmy, you can't let this
lead you all the time.

39
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:25,161
Sometimes you've gotta heed this.

40
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:28,763
I think you've got a lot of heart
in there, mister, don't you?

41
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,411
Don't you?
I mean, look around you.

42
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,208
Timmy?

43
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,989
Great work, Van. Thanks!

44
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,024
Remember my credo, Timmy.

45
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,992
Don't be a fool.
Stay in school.

46
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,591
God, I love this place.

47
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,636
Hey, Van. Hey, Van the man.

48
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,763
I called you last night, Van.

49
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,042
My name is Van Wilder,
and this is my home...

50
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:09,512
Coolidge College.

51
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,791
The last, well, seven years
have gone by way too fast.

52
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:27,298
This school's given me so much.
I just can't seem to give enough back.

53
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,301
- That's Van.
- That's him!

54
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,469
Oh, my God!

55
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,973
- Wow.
- Yeah. Wow.

56
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,243
I was the first-ever male cheerleader
at Huntington High!

57
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,411
The first ever!

58
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,983
Give me a V! Give me an A!

59
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,685
Give me an N!
What does it spell?

60
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:58,525
I see a rabbi, and he's
performing a circumcision...

61
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,121
on himself though.

62
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,593
You'll become disciplined.

63
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,534
Your mind will become a weapon.

64
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,478
I'm sorry. You really
just don't fit the profile.

65
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,718
We're just gonna do
a little bit of word association.

66
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,292
Cookies!

67
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,092
- My name is Van.
- Hi, my name is Terry.

68
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,837
Let's get it started then,
shall we?

69
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,552
Big finish.

70
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,085
Medic.

71
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,356
- Having us both at the same time...
- Will definitely lighten your load.

72
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,455
- We will bend over backwards for you.
- There's nothing too big...

73
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,761
- we can't handle.
- And we mean nothing.

74
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,133
- We'll stay on top of you...
- And ride you all semester.

75
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,899
Basically, we're saying we won't
blow the job, Van.

76
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,378
By the way, can you tell me if
there'll be any international travel?

77
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,419
Seriously, I swear to God,
I'm really uncomfortable now.

78
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,578
It's time you should go.

79
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,153
Not one acceptable candidate.

80
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,391
What is wrong
with the youth of today?

81
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,196
The Internet, dude.

82
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,897
Fries their brain cells, man.

83
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,237
It's cool, Colossus.
We'll find somebody.

84
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,243
C-los, get your ass off my shirt.

85
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,485
You really should
have him neutered, man.

86
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,019
That's up to him.

87
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,681
They are getting bigger,
aren't they?

88
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,588
I'll get that.

89
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,193
Looks like we got one more.

90
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,831
What's your name?

91
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,538
I'm Taj Mahal Badalandabad.

92
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,444
Where are you from, Taj?

93
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,110
I'm an exchange student
from Banglapur, India.

94
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,949
Welcome.
What can we do for you?

95
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,489
My exchange program culminates
at the end of this school year...

96
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,289
at which time I must return
to my home country...

97
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,126
where I do not have many friends.

98
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,861
I would like very much to spend my
remaining days here as your assistant.

99
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,403
Okay. We're just gonna do
a little word association.

100
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,803
Say the first thing
that comes to your mind. Milk.

101
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,465
Tit!

102
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,373
Oh, Mommy.

103
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,639
Most Indians would say "cow"
because they are sacred...

104
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,647
but I hear "milk,"
I think giant jugs.

105
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,149
You see, I cannot
go home a virgin.

106
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:09,779
I came here to study the great
American art of muff diving.

107
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,420
To smack clam, munch rug...

108
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,290
dine at just one American
pink taco stand.

109
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:19,762
You know, I wanted to-- how is it--
park the porpoise.

110
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:23,097
I want to take it
through the car wash, baby.

111
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,296
And get it waxed.
I want to wax it. Wax it!

112
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,669
You know, and air dry.

113
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,174
Air dry that shit, yeah.

114
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:35,111
And I would like to be
your assistant very much...

115
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,182
Mr. Van Wilder.

116
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,513
You'll need a copy of my class schedule
so you can take notes.

117
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,984
You'll also handle my finances.

118
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,180
I lecture at the freshman crisis group
every other Monday.

119
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,257
I'm spearheading the Save
the Swim Team Speedo Spectacular...

120
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,519
and the Bloated Belly Beer Bash
to Battle Bulimia this semester.

121
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,187
This is Sick Boy's room. Not a week's
gone by he hasn't had an ailment.

122
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,696
Shingles, hepatitis, crabs.
That was his fault.

123
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,426
- Matzo ball soup. Jewish penicillin.
- Thanks, Van.

124
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,435
Don't pick at it.
Moving on.

125
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,665
I'm moving my 7:15 to 8:15,
my 8:15 to 9:45...

126
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,764
and my 9:45 till Wednesday.

127
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,775
You owe $75,000 for the speed boat.

128
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,777
Cancel my guest lecture
at the Wharton School next week.

129
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,541
I feel like going somewhere tropical.
Tahiti. Are you writing this down?

130
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,879
- Yes, sir.
- You owe $200,000 for the thoroughbred.

131
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,953
Schedule a massage after my golf game
tomorrow afternoon.

132
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,215
- With a happy ending?
- Ah, yes.

133
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:21,282
And another $39,000 for your son's
tuition and housing this semester.

134
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,454
Tuition?
Van is still in school?

135
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,293
For the better part of a decade.

136
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,764
"Depression:
Is Prozac really the answer?"

137
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,773
"Famine-- Crisis in Rwanda."

138
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,775
"Tracking Tuition:
Where does our money really go?"

139
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:41,472
Each article well-written and researched
by our own Gwen Pearson...

140
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,847
and each article skipped over
by the majority of the student body.

141
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,443
I don't care.
I won't pander to them.

142
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:56,518
"Lite Beer vs. Dark-- The Showdown"
by Darius Grayson.

143
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,257
- Is that the same--
- Pulitzer-prize winning Darius Grayson.

144
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,265
He was an alumnus
of our journalism staff.

145
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,666
He wrote his best stuff in detox.
Still does, I'm told.

146
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,399
I have got a very challenging
assignment for you.

147
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,634
A story that nobody's
been able to get.

148
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,610
- About what?
- No, no. It's about whom.

149
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,360
It does not look good.

150
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,592
That's the end of the first half...

151
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,692
and the Chickadees will need
a miracle to come back and score.

152
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,071
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to step away from Van's vehicle.

153
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,342
Wilder!

154
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,816
He's got no business parking there.
That's my spot.

155
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,555
They need me, Ted.

156
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:04,151
This is the first time in my life
I'm glad I'm deaf!.

157
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:07,892
I can't hear the boos!
Now, listen up.

158
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,594
I'm only gonna go over this
one more time.

159
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,729
In the event they switch
to a zone defense...

160
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,672
we must swing the ball
around the perimeter.

161
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,746
This ball club is the heart
of this institution.

162
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,838
You win, it beats.
You lose, it breaks.

163
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,440
You're not boxing out, Big Papa.
You're my Windex man.

164
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,247
I want you shining glass.

165
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,946
We gotta Dup out there.
Darius.

166
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,957
I want you all over that ball
like a fat kid on a cupcake.

167
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,619
What are you looking at? Your mom
said you left your legs at home.

168
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,855
For God's sake!

169
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,693
I'd do anything for you guys...

170
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,734
which is why I'm throwing you
a little soiree tomorrow night...

171
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,530
but not without a W tonight.

172
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:48,038
You want to know why?
Nobody wants to celebrate a loss, guys.

173
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,631
Hey, man, you gonna invite
those freak honeys from Mt. Holyoke?

174
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:53,405
I already did.

175
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,504
They said they'd try to make it
if they weren't humping the Matadors.

176
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,083
- The Matadors?
- What?

177
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,152
Come on.
We got a ball game to win.

178
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,522
Let's go kick some Matador tail--

179
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,314
How bad do you wanna be...

180
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,510
a Delta?

181
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:39,090
Would you walk on broken glass?

182
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,183
Let the shards tear
into your Achilles tendon...

183
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,319
causing acute achondroplasia...

184
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,422
which could lead to non-congenital
dwarfism as you got older?

185
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,594
Ease up on the medical terms.
Just keep it simple and terrifying.

186
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:56,198
Gordon, there are very few things more
terrifying than non-congenital dwarfism.

187
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:59,675
Hey, Richard.
Ready to study?

188
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,873
Gwenny, I said 9:30.
It's 9:20.

189
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,416
I'm in the middle
of an 80-year tradition here.

190
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,120
I will be up when I'm done with
my presidential responsibilities.

191
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,191
Okay, I'll wait for you upstairs.

192
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,227
Who's my alabaster princess?

193
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,291
You are. You are.

194
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,366
Relax, guys.
They're just Doritos.

195
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,374
Listen to me,
you little fuck stains!

196
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:33,343
When I count to three, you will jump
or be banished from this house forever!

197
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,913
One, two--

198
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,078
Fuck!

199
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:07,442
Excuse me.
Where can I find Van Wilder?

200
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,447
In the Guiness Book
of World-fucking-Records, man...

201
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,017
under "Raddest fucking dude alive"!

202
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,109
Okay. Thanks.

203
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,246
In any one of these three rooms,
Gramps.

204
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,202
Sweet Joseph,
my son's a fairy.

205
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:37,036
Dad, what are you doing here?

206
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,368
- Thank God.
- No jammies.

207
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,971
- Party foul.
- No, don't-- Oh, dear God.

208
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,313
Next time you'll know better.

209
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,884
Seven years, and no degree.
You should have graduated twice by now.

210
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,723
I've done a lot in seven years.

211
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,059
If you don't have your doctorate,
you haven't done enough.

212
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,724
But you have wasted enough
of your time and my money.

213
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:05,031
Pack up your panties, son,
because we are headin' home.

214
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,142
I'm staying here with my friends.

215
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,702
Fine. Maybe your friends
can pay your tuition.

216
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,250
Because this morning I placed
a stop payment on this semester's check.

217
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,818
I'm sorry, son.

218
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,412
Sometimes in life you have to
realize a poor investment...

219
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,013
and cut your losses.

220
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,393
Write that down.

221
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,541
I need more time.

222
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,543
There's got to be something
that we can work out.

223
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,541
What is that intoxicating scent
you're wearing, Doris?

224
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,913
I have cats.

225
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,918
Meow!

226
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,623
Maybe you could put me
on some sort of extension...

227
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,620
program?

228
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,291
- A little pay-as-you-go?
- Are you trying to seduce me?

229
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,733
Who, me? No!

230
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,712
You know, maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

231
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,476
Being bad seldom is.

232
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,353
Oh, yeah.

233
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,760
That's the shit.

234
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,662
Guess what. I'm feeling
a little cold sore coming on.

235
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,930
Maybe we shouldn't do this
for three to six weeks.

236
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:49,269
Shut up, bitch,
and give me some sugar.

237
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:03,752
Fill this out. It's a standard
payment plan extension form.

238
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,185
You mean, we didn't have to--

239
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,023
But aren't you glad we did?

240
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,643
You can either mail this in
or drop it off.

241
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:27,973
Go, baby, go!

242
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,810
Mail it in!

243
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,710
Mail it in! Mail it in.

244
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,983
Van, you must make four
monthly payments of $5,000 each.

245
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,615
I'm sorry, Taj.
I'm gonna have to let you go.

246
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,127
I don't have the resources
to pay for your services anymore.

247
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,220
A good soldier
does not leave his commander...

248
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,391
just because he lies wounded,
arms torn off at the sockets...

249
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,368
intestines spilling out onto the mud,
picked at by the birds.

250
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,462
I will stay on at no charge.

251
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,302
Okay.

252
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,467
Exactly how much money do you have?

253
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,807
- He has only $34.
- Damn, Van!

254
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,905
What the hell you gonna do
with $34, man?

255
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:39,682
Congratulations, Taj!
Your first blow job.

256
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,948
In my country, a woman's mastery
of her gastronomical releases...

257
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,682
is the ultimate aphrodisiac.

258
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,953
Desiree is the foremost connoisseur
of chili con carne...

259
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,254
and a TA at Coolidge.

260
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,226
I wish I had teachers like that.

261
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,857
And just like that,
Topless Tutors was born.

262
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,129
X...

263
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,502
equals... six?

264
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:02,539
Yeah!

265
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,770
We knew you could do it.

266
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,073
Desi told me how she
and a few of her grad school pals...

267
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,239
could use some extra income.

268
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,579
Taj proved to be
an excellent company accountant...

269
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,346
as well as our most valued client.

270
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,959
Excuse me.

271
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,432
I'm looking for information
on a current student here, Van Wilder.

272
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,004
Freshman year.
I'll get the others.

273
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:44,776
- Wait. There are more of these?
- Actually, there are many more.

274
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,681
It seems Mr. Wilder didn't quite
come out of his shell...

275
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,016
until mid-sophomore year.

276
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,956
Thanks.

277
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,855
It's like this itchy,
rashy burning sensation.

278
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,057
And it hurts when l--

279
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,995
- Dance?
- When I pee.

280
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,969
- You hooked up with a burner.
- Yeah.

281
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,633
She seemed like a nice girl,
said it was her first time?

282
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:13,472
Always check the quality of the turf
before you step onto the field.

283
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,446
Listen, go to the campus hospital,
see Stu.

284
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:20,040
Tell him Van sent you, and remember--
Don't be a fool. Wrap your tool.

285
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,642
Thanks, Van. Thanks a lot.

286
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,721
Don't thank me.
Thank penicillin.

287
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,924
Crazy kids with their crazy VD.

288
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,162
- You must be Van.
- Hi.

289
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,332
I'm Gwen Pearson,
staff writer for The Liberator.

290
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,898
Okay, look, that old bag
is stronger than she looks.

291
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:46,102
I'm doing a human
interest piece on you.

292
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:49,009
I'm flattered.
I'd love for your piece to be on me.

293
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,950
But sadly I don't do interviews.
Never have, never will. I do lunch.

294
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,282
My editor did say
this would be a challenge.

295
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,379
Van, second date with Emily.

296
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,254
Blue. Brings out your eyes. Kid's got
killer eyes, not unlike yourself.

297
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,624
- Has anyone told you that before?
- Yes, my boyfriend.

298
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,431
Is it true that this is
your seventh year at Coolidge?

299
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,931
Carry the two--
Yes, that's correct.

300
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,093
So what's your boyfriend's name?
Does he go to school here?

301
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,262
- Does he appreciate you?
- That's none of your business.

302
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,602
You know what? You're right.

303
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:21,044
His name's Richard.
He's premed.

304
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,046
Van, you have a 1:30
with the swim team.

305
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,479
On it.

306
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,710
- You have an assistant?
- Yes, I do.

307
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,218
Is there anything you
can tell me about yourself...

308
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,791
that I haven't already found out
from your public records?

309
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,053
I'll be at the quad tomorrow night
at 10:00. Sound good?

310
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,562
- It's a date.
- It's an interview, not a date.

311
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,896
Gwen, first dates are interviews.

312
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,731
You going out tonight?

313
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,469
Rob's coming over.
I'm closing in on that diamond, Gwen.

314
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,909
The dynamic duo
will seal the deal tonight.

315
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,913
Good luck, ladies.

316
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:03,343
Somebody got awfully dressed up
to quiz me on my anatomy midterm.

317
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,253
I'm so sorry, baby.
I totally forgot.

318
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,918
- I have an interview for the paper.
- At 10:00 at night?

319
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:12,258
Can't you postpone it?
Gwen, first exam-- most crucial.

320
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:15,765
It's not like you're on a deadline
for the Boston Globe.

321
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,836
It's the only time he had available.
I'll call you as soon as I get back.

322
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,427
Bye.

323
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,263
He?

324
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,615
All right. Gwen, all right!
You're just in time.

325
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,685
- Take your clothes off.
- I'm not taking off my clothes.

326
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:38,017
It is the Naked Mile Run. Everybody
else is in their birthday suit.

327
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,958
Except that guy.

328
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,391
- I have a few questions for you.
- In time. This is gonna be fun.

329
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,624
You know that three-letter word
that starts with F?

330
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,702
So you're quite the campus man,
heading events like the Jäger Olympics.

331
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:54,033
Yes, well, you haven't lived...

332
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,073
until you've shot putted
blitzed on Jäger.

333
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,972
- Heinie?
- This was a really bad idea.

334
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,812
Are we gonna reschedule or what?

335
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,924
Who's a big boy?

336
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,658
Oh, God!

337
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,891
Those things
could raise the Titanic.

338
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:23,964
You Van Wilder?

339
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,503
The strip club owner got tired
of using his B squad...

340
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:29,506
so he came back
for the starting lineup.

341
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,337
Topless Tutors was dead.

342
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,673
We are truly up the Ganges River
without a bamboo oar.

343
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,511
We're still $1,200 short
of your next tuition payment.

344
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:42,178
Taj, I learned a long time ago
that worrying is like a rocking chair.

345
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,585
It gives you something to do,
but it doesn't get you anywhere.

346
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,247
Write that down.

347
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,622
Don't even sweat it, Taj.
I've got a plan.

348
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,824
- Let's go get fucked up.
- Sounds good.

349
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,397
Is that all you think about?

350
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,261
I admit I applied for this job...

351
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,097
because I wanted to cut loose
and shake my rump...

352
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,728
but I do not believe that this dilemma
will be solved by partying.

353
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,540
Can I help you, son?

354
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,245
I certainly hope so, Mr. Wilder.

355
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:11,281
I come to you in desperation.

356
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:15,717
I'm Panos Patakos, president
of the Lambda Omega Omega fraternity.

357
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:18,881
I'm sure you're aware
of our... stigma.

358
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,153
Yeah, you guys have had
the best GPA the last 50 years.

359
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,152
Indeed, but believe it or not...

360
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,493
the best GPA doesn't get you laid.

361
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,033
- Damn well should.
- Amen.

362
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,571
This month marks
our 75th anniversary.

363
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:37,233
I am here to ask you to aid us
in throwing a party...

364
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,242
a party we can be proud of...

365
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:42,245
a party people will
actually show up to.

366
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:46,147
Gosh, I'd really love to help, but I
have a bamboo oar stuck up my Ganges.

367
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,843
It's very scary stuff.

368
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,853
I just don't have the time.

369
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,384
How much is your time worth?

370
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,152
Panes reminded me that I had one...

371
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,389
very valuable skill
I'd yet to tap--

372
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:03,332
my undeniable ability
to throw one hell of a party.

373
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,940
I was hanging on by a thread,
but I was still making tuition.

374
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,081
The strawberry! Eat the strawberry!
It's worth 250!

375
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,447
- Don't you think I know that?
- You treat me like a child.

376
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,452
I don't like the way you
condescend me.

377
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:24,454
- Don't do that!
- Frankly, you're juvenile.

378
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,114
Guys.

379
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,124
I know Ms. Pac Man's special.

380
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:31,354
She's fun. She's cute.
She swallows.

381
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,556
But we gotta talk, guys.

382
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:36,634
Huddle up. Come on.
Team meeting here.

383
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,431
Cowboy. All right.

384
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,438
I look at you guys,
and you know what I see?

385
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,134
A collective GPA of 52,000?

386
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:45,539
Yeah! No!

387
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,908
I see a bunch of party animals...

388
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,243
crouched in attack position,
ready to strike.

389
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:51,713
Am I right?

390
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,317
No one even knows we're here.

391
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,752
Au contraire, mon frères.
Girls!

392
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:02,086
I'd like you to meet
Sherri and Terri.

393
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,753
Two girls utterly infatuated...

394
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,423
with men who have
larger than normal...

395
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,762
medulla oblongatas.

396
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:19,433
Pearson, I got a hot news tip for you.
It's Friday night. Get out of here.

397
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:22,843
I know. I'm just doing some final
revisions to this piece on euthanasia.

398
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,348
Oh, I read that.
Made me want to kill myself.

399
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,678
I'm kidding.

400
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,946
- Where's my Wilder story?
- There is no story, Elliot.

401
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:32,285
The guy's a joke. He tries to turn
every interview into a date.

402
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,688
A good writer gets her story
no matter what.

403
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:39,628
Please get me the Wilder piece.
He's throwing a big party tonight.

404
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:42,029
You should be there.

405
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:52,272
- This is really a pimpin' good time.
- Yes, it is.

406
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:58,477
Look who's checking out
the Badalandabad. Her name's Naomi.

407
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,983
That's "I moan" backwards.

408
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,884
I put in a good word for you.

409
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:08,721
Hey, Tajy. Let's boogie.

410
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,112
These are the most pathetic
bunch of pledges.

411
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:32,808
You picked 'em.

412
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,586
Hey, babe.

413
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,316
- Why aren't you in costume?
- I can't stay. I have to work tonight.

414
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,324
You're gonna miss
the biggest party of the year.

415
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,062
Well, I gotta go.

416
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,654
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- What?

417
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,666
This party so rocks, Richard.

418
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,999
- This party sucks rectum, Jeannie.
- Okay.

419
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,173
Where the hell is everyone?

420
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,573
Mad props
for this pimpin' good time...

421
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,771
go out to those
hung and handsome bad boys...

422
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,780
of Lambda Omega Omega.

423
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,676
Thanks for the good time, fellas.

424
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:21,260
- Let's get you some skates.
- I'm not here to skate.

425
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,527
For some reason,
my editor thinks you're a story.

426
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,159
What do you think?

427
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,137
As a story, I think...

428
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,536
you're a little soft.

429
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:33,509
Wow, all this time I thought I was more
to you than just some flaccid story.

430
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,312
A dilemma has arose up front.

431
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:39,315
- Don't know if we got our point across.
- Crystal clear, guys.

432
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,885
- This is incredible.
- 100 per cent. Don't go anywhere.

433
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,477
Seriously.
Van is a godsend.

434
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:47,319
I would have paid him way more
than a grand for this party.

435
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,586
I would have cashed in
my Israel bonds.

436
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:52,629
- How do you put a price on dignity?
- How do you put a price on poonani?

437
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,165
- Yes!
- Oh, God!

438
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,301
Oh, my God. Feel it!

439
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:05,735
Whoa. Trick or treat.
What's going on?

440
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:09,007
This vaginal discharge
won't let us partake in the party.

441
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,513
Graphic.

442
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,913
I'm sure we can accommodate
a few more, yeah?

443
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,781
No can do.
We're at maximum capacity.

444
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,759
- What are you doing here?
- You two know each other?

445
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,487
That's my girlfriend,
gluteous erecti.

446
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,325
- You must be premed Dick.
- Yeah, that's right.

447
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,628
- What's it to you?
- Thanks for the story.

448
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:30,792
What story?

449
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,799
Brilliant, Pearson.

450
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,134
I have been inundated
with people telling me...

451
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,367
how much they enjoy
reading about this guy.

452
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:40,273
They want more, and so do I.
I want you to do a follow-up.

453
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,608
I did your story, Elliot.
I'm not doing another one.

454
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,080
Even if I tell you it's gonna be on the
front page of the graduation issue...

455
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,445
in two months?

456
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,487
And I quote,
"Van Wilder is a party pimp. "

457
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,490
Sick Boy.
Can you believe she wrote that?

458
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:57,618
Van Wilder's phone.
I do not foresee that to be a problem.

459
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,357
And that guy she's with--
all kinds of wrong for her.

460
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:04,231
- Sick Boy, how are you doing?
- Van, the shingles are all gone.

461
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,669
That ointment really worked.

462
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,136
Thanks.

463
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,139
Lookin' good there, buddy.

464
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,211
- He'll call you back.
- Unbelievable.

465
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,750
Van Wilder's phone.

466
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,912
- Terrible.
- I think so. Yeah.

467
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,047
- Hang on.
- Unbelievable.

468
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,523
Van's room.
Saturday night, yeah.

469
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:31,322
That's-- How did you--
From the paper?

470
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:34,091
Yeah, that's fine!
Okay, thanks.

471
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,429
- No problem confirming. Bye.
- This writing, it's just--

472
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,794
I was just wondering if you could...
slam the door in my face.

473
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,668
Van, you must listen to me.

474
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:46,403
Because of her article, everybody wants
to have a party thrown by Van Wilder...

475
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,206
the party liaison.

476
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,679
Your cash camel has arrived!

477
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,719
We need to talk.

478
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,624
This is why I don't do interviews.
You totally slammed me.

479
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:04,126
You journalists
and your irresponsible reporting.

480
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:07,198
I recorded quotes that you got money
from the Lambdas to throw them a party.

481
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:10,096
Recorded? What are you, bugged?
Do I need to frisk you?

482
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,192
Why is my story
such a big deal to you?

483
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:15,170
Because I didn't want the students
to know I threw the party.

484
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:18,470
They paid me, but that's not
the only reason I did it.

485
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:21,807
Lambdas are cool in their own right.
People just needed to realize it.

486
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:25,371
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you had a benevolent agenda.

487
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:27,815
There's two sides
to every story, Gwen.

488
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,319
I have a chance to make front page
of the graduation issue...

489
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,685
which is a huge deal to me.

490
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,156
Let me get the other side.

491
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,524
There's this function
I'm hosting tomorrow night.

492
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:40,689
If you want...
you could tag along.

493
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,028
- I'll be there.
- It's a date.

494
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:45,694
It's an interview.

495
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:47,828
Remember, today's assignment
is about shadow.

496
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,066
So don't get too hung up
on detail.

497
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:52,074
All right, everybody?

498
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,007
Oh, Lord!

499
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:59,308
So much sinew,
I need a bigger pencil.

500
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,351
8:30 p.m.
Yeah, that's fine.

501
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:06,848
Word spread around campus. My calendar
was filled with parties to plan.

502
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:10,519
Van Wilder, party liaison, was born.

503
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,764
At the Hillel House, I broke bread.

504
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,766
And then I broke the boredom.

505
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:24,208
They said I did them a mitzvah.
That's Yiddish for "good deed. "

506
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,777
Write that down.

507
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:29,369
Oh, yeah, she came too.

508
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,977
This is the second party
of his she's gone to.

509
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,452
Sounds serious. Threatened?

510
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,787
Threatened? Please.

511
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,761
I'm president of both my fraternity
and the student government.

512
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:50,199
He's nothing more
than a mild rectal itch.

513
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,660
You know what you do
about a mild rectal itch, Gordo?

514
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,864
- What's that, Richard?
- You scratch it.

515
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,908
Then you scratch it some more.

516
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,909
The more you scratch at it,
the worse it gets...

517
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:03,572
until finally you have nothing left
but a raw, chafed...

518
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:06,582
possibly infected anal cavity.

519
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:09,050
Then it's won.

520
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,919
When all you had to do from the start
was take a medicated pad...

521
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:15,852
and smother it.

522
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,490
All right, people,
midterm is next week.

523
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,103
Here you have your five categories--

524
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:30,106
commerce and trade,
so forth and so on.

525
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,971
What you doing?

526
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:35,807
I'm in the middle of class.
You know, that five-letter word.

527
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:38,882
I thought we could spend
some time together...

528
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:41,281
for the story.

529
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,720
I want you to have this.

530
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:49,051
- Yeah.
- And thank you.

531
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,391
All right, things to remember--
commerce and trade--

532
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,330
Everybody just file out
in an orderly fashion.

533
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,742
What? Come on. Hop in.

534
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,744
I am not getting
in that thing with you.

535
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:11,212
If you want the story,
you'll get in this thing with me.

536
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,584
What happened?
Is everyone okay?

537
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:21,816
Wilder.

538
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:26,455
Are we gonna get in trouble
for being in here?

539
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,499
It's cool. Equipment manager owes me
a favor. I introduced him to his wife.

540
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,966
Life is all about
developing relationships, Gwen.

541
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,664
I hope you can skate.

542
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,502
So the deal is, I score...

543
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,169
you cooperate
and answer all my questions?

544
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,747
- I miss--
- Dinner for two, me and you.

545
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:46,014
Clothing optional.

546
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,598
Come on!

547
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:18,973
Holy crap.

548
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:41,638
My brothers play hockey...

549
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,639
for the Rangers.

550
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,277
My dad just didn't see me
as a sound investment anymore.

551
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:51,314
But he gave up on me and my mom
long before I ever came here.

552
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,645
Maybe seven years of tuition...

553
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:58,187
is a good way to remind him
that you're still angry.

554
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:03,655
So how long have you
and premed Richard been together?

555
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:06,992
- Since my freshman year.
- I bet he's a tighty whitey guy.

556
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:10,090
- Excuse me?
- White, elastic band, constrictive.

557
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:12,465
You can tell a lot about a person
by the kind of drawers they wear.

558
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,060
Like you. Granny panties, I bet.

559
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,663
Does that allude to me
being the plain, boring type?

560
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:20,105
I just wanted a visual.

561
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,112
I think it takes a lot more than
the kind of underwear one wears...

562
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:24,875
to define them as a person.

563
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,416
Like what?

564
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,418
Like their actions.

565
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,420
For instance, most people...

566
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,218
want to get out of school
so they can make money.

567
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:37,294
You're trying to make money
to stay in school.

568
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,796
- Why?
- I like it here.

569
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,098
What about your future?

570
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:49,572
- You take life way too seriously.
- Life is serious.

571
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,404
I used to party with this guy
who once told me...

572
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,638
"Don't take life too seriously.
You'll never get out alive."

573
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,646
He used to write
for the school paper.

574
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,914
He kept babbling about the differences
between light and dark beer.

575
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,756
Very strange, but good advice.

576
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:12,920
You think about the future too much,
you kinda forget about the present...

577
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,998
obviously.

578
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:18,330
And I am really enjoying
the present right now...

579
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:21,564
sharing a penalty box and a tri-latte
with Gwen Pearson...

580
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:25,335
who believes censorship reflects
society's lack of confidence in itself.

581
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,570
You actually read that article?

582
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:31,375
Okay, look, I read the damn article,
but don't tell anyone...

583
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:33,916
because if word gets out that I read,
my reputation--

584
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,851
shot to hell.

585
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,820
She's smart, she's beautiful...

586
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,828
she can skate.

587
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,627
She's not for you, dude.
She's too high-strung.

588
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:51,861
Besides, babes that fine--

589
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,904
they're way into themselves
and shit.

590
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,202
After this weekend,
we should have sufficient funds...

591
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,210
to cover your next two payments.

592
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,473
I mean, this girl is dynamite.

593
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,442
Too bad she's dating
Strapper John, MD.

594
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:15,524
- Where did you find that?
- In your room a few days ago.

595
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,857
I'm trying to spark this bong,
but this damn thing won't light.

596
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,761
That's no bong!
It's for my schlong!

597
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:28,899
Hold on.

598
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:31,167
You mean I put my mouth
on your cock pump?

599
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,668
Oh, damn!

600
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,081
I have a date with Naomi
tomorrow night...

601
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:44,120
and I just wanted
to bring my A game.

602
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:48,658
Taj, come on!
That's what I'm here for, right?

603
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,818
Now, follow my foolproof plan...

604
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:53,988
and I'm gonna help you put
the bang in Banglapur.

605
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,960
All you need are the three
fundamentals-- scented candles...

606
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,394
massage oil...

607
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,131
and Barry White.

608
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,469
Write that down.

609
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:07,806
- Hey, no cock pump.
- No cock pump.

610
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,311
Barry White.

611
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:13,212
- I'm gonna go wash my hands now.
- Oh, Gwen!

612
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:17,151
Your labia feels so good
around my swollen phallus.

613
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,357
I'm fairly confident
I'm going to ejaculate.

614
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,121
I'm releasing my seminal fluids
inside of you now!

615
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,875
Are you okay?

616
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,179
Yeah. Why?

617
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,346
Didn't you--

618
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,351
It's kinda hard in 15 seconds.

619
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,618
Damn it!

620
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:56,821
You know the kind of pressure
I'm under with my exams.

621
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,755
- I'm sorry.
- Look, I'm sorry.

622
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,663
This semester's marks could determine
the next ten years of our lives.

623
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,668
Do you realize that?

624
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,096
You know...

625
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:12,300
you shouldn't take life
too seriously.

626
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,310
You'll never get out alive.

627
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:21,344
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

628
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,316
I'm late for my study group.

629
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,696
She was getting awfully chummy
with the rectal itch.

630
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,363
Son of a bitch.
Disappear!

631
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,372
Yes, superior leader, sir.

632
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:49,275
It's time to excise
that cancerous lump.

633
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,543
Forget him. Let's crap in the chapter
room and make the pledges clean it up.

634
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,210
- It'll be fun.
- I wish I could, Gordo.

635
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,719
I got dinner
at Gwen's parents' house.

636
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:59,983
Sounds special.
Is Wilder gonna be there?

637
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,556
Hey, guys. Hey, Richard.

638
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,561
Is there anything
I can do for you today?

639
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:12,964
Dear Van--

640
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,402
Here you go, Taj.
Get your rave on, man.

641
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:21,808
- Thanks.
- You got it.

642
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:25,973
"See you tonight. Gwen."
The invite to the parents' house.

643
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:28,984
This is big.
This is very, very big.

644
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,077
- Doesn't she have a boyfriend?
- Details.

645
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:33,383
I'm off.
Taj, you're in charge.

646
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,255
I do not think I'm capable
of handling such a responsibility.

647
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,591
Listen to me. Do you know why
I chose you as my assistant?

648
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:42,131
So you could teach me
how to muff dive?

649
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,435
Well, yeah, but also...

650
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,663
because you have the potential
to be great.

651
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:08,282
- May I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Van--

652
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:11,293
You made it.

653
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:14,023
Evelyn, this is one of your daughter's
acquaintances from school.

654
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:15,826
There's room for one more?

655
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:18,629
By all means.
Come in, please.

656
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:25,401
Definitely be out of the question
unless they all agreed with us...

657
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:28,103
and we talked it over.

658
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,174
Excuse me, gentlemen.

659
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,877
Excuse me, gentlemen.

660
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:37,715
Van, this is Dr. Henke,
proctologist.

661
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:41,655
Oh, well, holy crap.
I hope you're not on call tonight.

662
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:44,986
Dr. Beaverman, OB-GYN.

663
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:47,427
Van Wilder,
G-L-A-D to meet you.

664
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,556
And of course, Gwen's father.

665
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,659
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

666
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,499
Dr. Pearson?

667
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:57,039
- Indeed.
- Indeed. Super.

668
00:42:57,141 --> 00:43:00,736
All right.
So... am I here for a physical?

669
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:04,371
'Cause I'm gonna need a few cocktails
before I start coughing for you fellas.

670
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:15,291
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know.

671
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,155
No, thank you.

672
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,957
Mr. Wilder here
is quite the collegian.

673
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:22,294
He's in his, what, sixth year?

674
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:24,299
Lucky number seven, actually.

675
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,203
- What are you studying, son?
- I dabble in a bit of everything.

676
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:31,399
I've tried to experience
all that Coolidge has to offer.

677
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:33,408
Surely you have a career in mind.

678
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:36,038
Not really.

679
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:38,273
I'm still looking for that
dare-to-be-great situation.

680
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:41,647
Maybe you should start looking for
that dare-to-be-employed situation.

681
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,845
The student body
finds Van so intriguing...

682
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,320
that my editor has asked me
to do an exposé on him...

683
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:47,890
for the school newspaper.

684
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,119
Isn't that wonderful?

685
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:52,695
- That will be quite the page-turner.
- It'll be a very well-written article.

686
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,128
Gwen is an extremely gifted
journalist.

687
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:57,723
Are you and Richard
in the same fraternity?

688
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,325
Oh, no.

689
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:03,065
Van isn't exactly
Delta lota Kappa material.

690
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:06,506
Richard, you rascal, you never
told me that you were a DIK.

691
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:09,813
Not that you had to.

692
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,741
I'm gonna go get
another bottle of champagne.

693
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,080
- Richard, will you help me open it?
- Sure.

694
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:22,757
Wow.

695
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,351
If he's here,
who's running Hell?

696
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:29,992
- What are you doing out there?
- Proving a point.

697
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,501
Your friend doesn't fit in.
He's a virus, and I'm the vaccine.

698
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:36,402
- I can't believe you're doing this.
- Pop quiz. True or false.

699
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:40,204
You and that GDI have been spending
an inordinate amount of time together.

700
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,505
True. Now here's a multiple choice
question for you.

701
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:45,639
You're A, an asshole; B, an asshole
who isn't staying at my place tonight...

702
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:48,445
- or C, all the above?
- What's B again?

703
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:52,010
Gwenny, I'm kidding.
I apologize.

704
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:54,784
- Gwenny, where are you going?
- To go save Van.

705
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:58,020
God only knows what my parents and
their stuck-up friends are doing to him.

706
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,030
Okay! All right!

707
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:11,130
You're a natural, Dr. P.
Hey, what are you looking at?

708
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:14,210
- Henke, you're up. Come on.
- All right.

709
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:18,044
Easy, sailor.

710
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:44,602
All right, Wilder, let's dance.

711
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:46,539
It's a good day to die, McDoogle.

712
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:50,470
Oh, yes.

713
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,272
Jesus! Criminy!

714
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:19,206
What happened to you, Wilder?
Don't think I don't remember.

715
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,470
You got an A
in my freshman economics class.

716
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,478
You remember one thing--

717
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,640
Apathy is the glove
into which evil slips its hand.

718
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,650
I'll write that down.

719
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:31,312
You do that.
You're not fooling anybody!

720
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:33,446
You're only fooling yourself!.

721
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:45,733
- Why don't you walk?
- I think I'll walk from here.

722
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:51,665
Are you stalking me?
Because that would be super.

723
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:54,676
My mom did want me to invite you
to her Tupperware party next week.

724
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:57,576
Was that a--

725
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:59,308
Judges' ruling.

726
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:02,579
Uh-huh. Yeah.
I do believe that was a joke.

727
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:11,051
I want to apologize for what
Richard did the other night.

728
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,925
It was a really immature stunt.

729
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:16,329
Yeah, I know...

730
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:19,425
but sometimes guys can do
some pretty childish things.

731
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,134
Let us proceed.

732
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:03,579
- Is he ready?
- Ah, yeah, he's ready.

733
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,079
It's go time.

734
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,754
Such a good boy.

735
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:21,160
Oh, stop for a second.
Stop.

736
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:23,922
Okay. Keep going.

737
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:36,502
For the love of God.

738
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:38,012
Smile, buddy.

739
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:46,188
Lovely.

740
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,554
It's all about presentation,
gentlemen.

741
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:59,434
Well, I'll be damned!

742
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:01,731
Poor guy just needed
a little TLC.

743
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:10,844
I got it, guys.
No problem whatsoever.

744
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,017
Let the damn baby
have his ball back.

745
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,856
Thank you, brothers.

746
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:25,524
It's not like he can see
out of it anyway.

747
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,994
Loser.

748
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:34,769
Awesome work, sisters.

749
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:40,441
Special delivery!

750
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:44,971
- Time out.
- What the fuck, Jeannie?

751
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:48,449
"From the sisters of Sigma Theta Tau."
Dig in, guys.

752
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,055
Oh, they're still warm.

753
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,928
- So creamy.
- They're awesome.

754
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:11,305
Oh, they're so creamy.

755
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:14,968
God, these are excellent.

756
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,774
Guys? Richard?

757
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,249
Think I've had these before.

758
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,992
Oh, my God!

759
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:39,594
I love this song.

760
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,568
I know.

761
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:44,333
It is the White Barry.

762
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:49,840
Is that for me?

763
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:51,880
I long to rub you the right way.

764
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:55,611
You're such a bad
little Badalandabad.

765
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,527
No harm, no foul.

766
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:12,026
- Are you all right?
- Never better, my jasmine flower.

767
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,721
That feels so good.

768
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:40,822
Oh, my God.

769
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:46,964
Take me.

770
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,935
I want you now.

771
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:50,802
Now!

772
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,841
Shit!

773
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:55,105
Don't tease me.

774
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:08,423
This is the culmination
of my being.

775
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:12,052
Baby, I'm about to culminate.
Now, get over here.

776
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,161
Tajy, I'm so hot.

777
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:18,063
- I feel on fire.
- Oh, yeah, me too, baby.

778
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:20,534
- Burning up.
- Oh, yeah, baby, I'm burning up.

779
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,935
You are most amazing
to make me feel so...

780
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:26,071
damn hot!

781
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:33,349
I wonder how T-Bad's date's going.

782
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:37,409
Scented candles,
massage oils, Barry White.

783
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:40,456
Yeah, we can't be too far
from climax, huh?

784
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:04,102
- Why do I always fail?
- You put too much pressure on yourself.

785
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:06,546
Don't worry about the money.
I'll figure something out.

786
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,049
More importantly...

787
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:12,383
when the time is right...

788
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:13,649
it'll happen.

789
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:15,657
You'll find the one.

790
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:34,668
I need to see the grade transcripts
for Van Wilder, please.

791
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:36,678
I don't think so.

792
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,977
Student transcripts
are confidential. Sorry.

793
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:15,508
Swim team really does
need your love, folks.

794
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:20,518
And if Milty Mingleton
can shove himself...

795
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:23,115
into that weenie bikini...

796
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:30,489
then you don't need to be shy
about making your donations now!

797
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,564
Thank you, Milty!

798
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:15,904
After we put all the water
back in the pool...

799
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:18,606
we'll be accepting donations
in the form of...

800
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:21,047
cash, Visa
and full-frontal nudity.

801
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,618
Hutch, take over.

802
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:28,321
That's right, folks.
Save the swim team.

803
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:32,660
Bikini-clad judges for a fund-raiser?
That's pretty ingenious.

804
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:35,322
Sex sells, Gwen. Sex sells.

805
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:38,265
It's not too late for you to enter
the doubles breaststroke if you like.

806
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:40,996
No, thanks.
I forgot my suit.

807
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:43,231
I just came across a bit
of interesting information.

808
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,864
All right, look.

809
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:48,137
The vet assured me that canine semen
is perfectly healthy.

810
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:49,939
In fact, surprisingly rich--

811
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,981
You've been 18 units shy of graduating
for the past 6 semesters.

812
00:55:56,986 --> 00:56:00,945
Whoa. You went klepto
on my transcripts.

813
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:03,025
What's going on with you?

814
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:05,321
You're actively trying
not to get out of here.

815
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:09,888
Why are you doing this? Do you ever
stop playing the in-depth reporter?

816
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:13,059
I just want to know why
you're putting off your life.

817
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:16,161
Not for the paper.
For me.

818
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:18,035
I have no comment...

819
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:21,676
for either of you.

820
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:58,412
External occipital protuberance.

821
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:02,946
Posterior gluteal line.

822
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:08,352
Dorsal appendage. Gwen.

823
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:11,120
- Was the last one right?
- Yeah, that's right.

824
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:14,719
Wrong! The dorsal appendage exists
only in marine-equipped mammalia.

825
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:16,458
I knew you weren't listening.

826
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,898
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

827
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:21,562
Let's get out of here,
go grab a beer.

828
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:25,535
Are you insane?
You know my midterm and finals ritual.

829
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:28,475
I study till 11:00.
Nine solid hours of sleep.

830
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:31,706
Protein shake in the morning.
Okay, very cute.

831
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:33,908
And also correct.

832
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,747
Which gives us 2 hours
and 53 minutes of study time.

833
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:39,879
So, honey, please focus.
All righty?

834
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,592
I have confirmations
from the African-American Club...

835
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:48,891
the Gay and Lesbian Caucus,
MECCA, HEPA, PETA.

836
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:51,660
This multi-coalition party
was a masterful plan.

837
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:54,430
It should triple our income.
I just hope it's enough.

838
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:56,801
Van, you must listen to me.

839
00:57:56,906 --> 00:58:00,000
We are merely one party away
from accomplishing our goal.

840
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:01,599
What if she's right, huh?

841
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:04,441
What if I'm avoiding graduation
because I'm scared?

842
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:06,276
Listen to yourself, meathead.

843
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:08,907
You've never doubted yourself
in your whole life.

844
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:11,350
This girl's got you thinking, man.
It's not good.

845
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:15,423
- Not good at all.
- Hey, you!

846
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:18,289
Please move banner
a skosh higher, huh?

847
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:22,423
You got all this.
I'm gonna go--

848
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:24,796
I'm gonna go make some calls
for the party, okay?

849
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:31,306
- Hi, Van.
- Hi, Donna.

850
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:33,637
Hey, guys.

851
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:38,937
- What are you doing in here?
- I had to talk to you.

852
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:41,778
I thought a lot about
what you said, and--

853
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:45,046
Well, just--

854
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:47,122
just take a look at this.

855
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:49,589
Yeah. Doodles.

856
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,820
I attended class today.
Just about stayed the whole time too.

857
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,056
I'm glad you went
to all your classes today.

858
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:57,064
And a few that weren't mine.
Stepped into the wrong one.

859
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:59,259
Liked what I heard, stayed.

860
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,735
That's great. It really is.

861
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:05,607
It really is.
But don't do it for me.

862
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,338
Do it for you.

863
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:11,277
Maybe I'm doing it
for both of us.

864
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:16,685
I shouldn't even
be talking to you like this.

865
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:19,152
And I shouldn't be
in the women's locker room!

866
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:22,747
But sometimes you gotta let
your heart lead you...

867
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:26,454
even if you know it's someplace
you know you're not supposed to be.

868
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:30,165
How often does your heart lead you
into the women's locker room?

869
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:36,100
- This would be a first.
- Why do I find that hard to believe?

870
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:38,105
I'm not saying I've never
been in here before.

871
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,835
I'm saying it's usually a different part
of my anatomy that does the leading.

872
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:42,935
Oh, my God.

873
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:50,074
I just couldn't believe it.
Gwen and Van in the women's locker room.

874
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:53,952
I mean, I just couldn't believe it.
So anyway, let me tell you something.

875
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:08,162
I'm sorry, fellas.
The bakery's closed.

876
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:12,973
- I'm here to enlist your services.
- Let me guess.

877
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:15,738
"Come as your favorite drunk-on-jis,
come-gargling frat boy party"?

878
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:18,040
Then your mom can come.

879
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:22,080
It's gonna be a bachelor party.

880
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:24,415
One last night of debauchery
with the fellas...

881
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,512
before settling down
with my fiancée, Gwen.

882
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:32,220
Oh, please, you didn't think she'd
be interested in a fuckup like you?

883
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:47,671
That ought to be enough
to get you started.

884
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:07,827
Hello?

885
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:09,864
Casey.
I'm just using Gwen's computer.

886
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:11,957
Is Gwen there?
I need to talk to her.

887
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:15,299
She's at Richard's getting ready for
the engagement dinner tonight. Message?

888
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:17,635
Nope. That's all right.

889
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,915
Bye. Thanks for coming.

890
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:30,611
Lindsey and Rob make such
a great couple, don't you think?

891
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,620
Yeah, I'm happy for them.

892
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:35,486
They're gonna make a great
married couple too. You know why?

893
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:37,491
Because they love each other?

894
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:39,493
Because they're compatible.

895
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:44,427
Like a heart transplant patient finding
a donor with the same blood type...

896
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,729
and just the right
chromosomal anomalies.

897
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:49,669
A perfect match,
connected forever.

898
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:53,601
But that would mean
one of them would have to be dead.

899
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:57,905
Gwenny, I'm just saying
that they're a match.

900
01:01:58,014 --> 01:02:00,244
Just like you and me.

901
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:07,278
Lucky girl.

902
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:09,948
Gwendolyn Elizabeth Pearson...

903
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:13,995
I'd be honored if you and I
surgically and spiritually...

904
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:16,725
grafted our lives together.

905
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,700
Richard,
I don't know what to say.

906
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:23,761
Just say yes, because
I've got even more amazing news.

907
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:26,103
Northwestern called this morning.
They wanna interview me.

908
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,871
They're gonna send some recruit alums
to campus for written and oral exams.

909
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:31,845
And then I am in!

910
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:34,212
Oh, man, Northwestern.

911
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:37,616
That's great.
I'm so happy for you, Richard.

912
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:42,783
Be happy for both of us. The Richard
and Gwen life plan is kicking in.

913
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:45,359
Northwestern.
I am the shit.

914
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:50,123
Your father wants to get us a place in
Forest Grove as an engagement present.

915
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:52,963
- My parents know about this?
- Yeah, I told everyone.

916
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:57,872
Where are you going?

917
01:02:57,974 --> 01:03:00,534
I'm not sure,
and for some reason...

918
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:03,168
I feel really good
about that.

919
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:09,316
I can't hold on

920
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,511
There's no easy way

921
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:15,056
Hey, Van, can I borrow--

922
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:17,058
My God, what happened to you?

923
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:21,524
- I got hit by a big truck.
- Are you okay?

924
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,394
I'm all out of love

925
01:03:23,499 --> 01:03:25,831
I'm so lost without you

926
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:28,267
I know you were right

927
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:30,931
Believing for so long

928
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:38,536
Dope song.
What's it called?

929
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,014
"Gwen Used Me For Her Story,
Then Married an Ass Wipe...

930
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:44,609
and Ran Over My Heart
With a Big Metaphorical Truck."

931
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,915
Originally performed
by Air Supply.

932
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:49,082
Who's Air Supply?

933
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:51,251
How old are you, Sally?

934
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:55,195
I'm old enough to be jealous
of that Gwen girl.

935
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:05,339
Okay, you can do this.

936
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:11,771
I'm all out of love

937
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:14,543
I'm so lost without you

938
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:17,949
I know you were right
believing for so long

939
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:21,455
You must be Gwen--
the truck driver.

940
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:25,559
Hey. Excuse me.
Gwen!

941
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:29,796
Hey, hold up a second.
What are you doing here?

942
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:32,561
What am I doing here?
What were you doing in there?

943
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:36,297
As smashed as I am, I'm pretty sure
that's my room, wasn't it?

944
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:39,101
What was that girl,
a freshman?

945
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,733
She reads at a sophomore level.

946
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:44,176
This was a big mistake, Van.
I'm leaving.

947
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,681
Why are you here? Did you come to
hire me to do your bachelorette party?

948
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:51,617
'Cause your party pimp has already
been booked by your fiancé.

949
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:55,282
- My fiancé? What are you talking about?
- When are you two tying the knot?

950
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,655
Seriously, I'd really
like to hold that date open.

951
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,752
That is none of your business.
And you know what?

952
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:02,626
You're none of mine.

953
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:12,333
Sounds to me like your rectal itch
was getting a late-night booty scratch.

954
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:17,208
First, my bitch turns down my proposal.
Then she runs into that loser's arms.

955
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:19,679
Now I don't even know
where my bitch is.

956
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:22,546
Wilder's got some big blowout tonight.
Maybe your bitch is gonna be there.

957
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:24,916
You do not call her that, gonad!

958
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,148
Hey, guys.
Just giving you all the 411.

959
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,781
I'm a counselor for the Further
Leaders of America's overnighter.

960
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:32,986
The bus doesn't leave for a few hours.
Is there anything I can do before I go?

961
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:34,790
Anything at all?

962
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:40,194
Okay, listen up. We've got
one quick stop off before we go.

963
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:42,737
Tit wad!

964
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:46,871
All right, thank you, man.
Enjoy yourself.

965
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:49,035
All right, sister. Enjoy yourself.
Power to the people.

966
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:50,908
- How you doing, my man?
- What's up?

967
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:55,976
I hate to break this to you, Ming,
but you ain't Asian.

968
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:59,319
Man, you ever heard
of Tiger Woods, bitch?

969
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:02,357
You better get out of here before I hit
you upside the head with a three iron.

970
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,450
What's wrong with you?
Enjoy yourself.

971
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:08,655
- What's wrong, dog?
- Nothing. I don't feel like partying.

972
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:11,232
That's a first.

973
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:14,497
Hey, Van. I just wanted to come by
and extend an olive branch.

974
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:18,369
- I D, please.
- It's a terrible picture of me, but--

975
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:21,136
Well, I'll be the judge of--

976
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:23,211
There's nothing fake
about this I D.

977
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,940
Did you sit behind me
two semesters ago?

978
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:28,573
I think I remember this behind.
I mean, you sitting behind me.

979
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:31,710
This whole rivalry thing
has become a tad childish.

980
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:36,258
Well, I hope we can put it
all behind us and be friends.

981
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:37,792
That's what Gwen wants.

982
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:40,657
You have absolutely
no idea what Gwen wants.

983
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:44,761
Say hi to your gerbil for me.

984
01:06:51,874 --> 01:06:53,239
Okay, kids.

985
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,242
This is our Uncle Jäger.

986
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:58,142
That's right.
Drink up.

987
01:06:58,247 --> 01:07:01,011
This tastes like shit.
Do you have any scotch?

988
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:05,317
Gotta go.
Sorry. Bye.

989
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:07,321
Bye-bye. Call me.

990
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,050
Gentlemen.

991
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:10,989
Trooper.

992
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:15,154
We got an anonymous tip that there's
some underage drinking going on here.

993
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:16,424
Hutch?

994
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,557
Hell no, man.
I've been at the door all night.

995
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:25,570
Good enough for me.
Have fun, guys.

996
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:28,199
All right, Trapper.
Stay cool.

997
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:33,347
- I love you, man.
- No, man.

998
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:35,178
I love you.

999
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:40,585
Those circus midgets
cannot hold their booze!

1000
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,761
Don't worry, Van.
We'll get you out, man.

1001
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:03,107
Delta Iota Kappa rules!

1002
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,817
Damn it, Gwen, pick it up.
I know you're there.

1003
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,513
You know I have my Northwestern
interview next week.

1004
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:17,757
Look, I need you
to help me "release"...

1005
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,828
some pressure.

1006
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:23,956
You know, help me "relax. "

1007
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:26,159
Just so we're clear,
I'm talking about inter course.

1008
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,031
I know you had
a fling with Wilder.

1009
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:32,233
And it's okay. You just had
to get it out of your system.

1010
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:35,003
I just hope
you used some protection.

1011
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,705
And I wouldn't want
our future children to be tainted...

1012
01:08:37,813 --> 01:08:40,441
because Mommy went slumming
one night back in college.

1013
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:45,020
Why don't you go "release"
your own pressure?

1014
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:49,751
And just so we're clear,
I'm telling you to go fuck yourself!.

1015
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:57,421
Hi, partner in crime. Is there anything
I can do for you today?

1016
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:58,932
Oh, my God!

1017
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:01,195
We make such the fab team!

1018
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:05,330
Last night, I was so like Bonnie and
you were so like Clyde. And now this.

1019
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:08,569
Would you shut up?
I'm trying to pleasure you.

1020
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:10,838
Sorry, Richard.
Pleasure away.

1021
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:16,246
- PS, this is an awesome room.
- PS, shut the fuck up!

1022
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,719
Here, I'm done
with all of this.

1023
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:27,125
- The Wilder story's not done.
- Read it before you criticize.

1024
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:30,027
He got expelled today.
Is that in your story?

1025
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:32,032
'Cause it should be.

1026
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:45,547
- Is Van here?
- He don't wanna see you.

1027
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:47,741
- Excuse me?
- Look.

1028
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,910
- Why don't you just leave him alone?
- Home wrecker.

1029
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,622
Oh, thank you!
Thank you!

1030
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,461
Out of my way!

1031
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:47,634
Stop packing! You can appeal the
expulsion. It's in the school charter.

1032
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:51,679
"Any student may appeal an expulsion
before the university judicial board...

1033
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:54,442
and state his or her case
within 48 hours of being discharged."

1034
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:58,175
Do you want my hot tub,
or should I just give it to Milty?

1035
01:10:58,287 --> 01:10:59,948
We can get the law club to help.

1036
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:02,455
They owe you after the
"Sue Me, Screw Me" soiree you threw.

1037
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:05,550
Thank you. I appreciate it.
I'm really not interested.

1038
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:09,028
- You're not hearing me--
- It's over, Taj!

1039
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:14,164
Fuck you, Van Wilder!

1040
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:18,373
You heard me.
I say-- I say...

1041
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:20,669
fuck you, you-you-you--

1042
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:22,835
you-- you--

1043
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:25,072
you pussy ass motherfucker!

1044
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:27,045
You-- You dicksucker!

1045
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:29,083
Don't sugar coat it, Taj.

1046
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:31,880
Tell me how you really feel.
Seven years.

1047
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:36,117
Seven years!
I've accomplished nothing!

1048
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:38,125
There's no reason
to stay here anymore!

1049
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:40,058
Sure, sure.
You've made tons of friends...

1050
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:44,030
who in the drop of a rupee do anything
for you, and that doesn't mean much?

1051
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:47,068
Who cares about Sick Boy
and the charities you've helped...

1052
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:50,070
and all of our athletics--
those are all so minuscule?

1053
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:51,833
And I guess so is a promise...

1054
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:55,341
made to a wet-behind-the-ears kid
from India whose only dream...

1055
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:58,504
was to bury his face
in a beautiful woman's lotus patch.

1056
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:02,615
You have shown me a life
I could only dream about...

1057
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:05,346
back home while masturbating
in my father's woodshed.

1058
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:09,253
Most importantly,
you saw potential...

1059
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:13,551
in me.

1060
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:18,260
If you do not see potential in yourself,
then you are a blind man.

1061
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:21,634
I'm leaving.

1062
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:24,205
Then leave.
But leave the honorable way.

1063
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,640
You've been looking for
that dare-to-be-great situation.

1064
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:31,144
It is at your doorstep.

1065
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:36,482
We need to talk.

1066
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:50,563
Get me the law club.

1067
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,408
It's ridiculous!
It's preposterous!

1068
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:08,983
It's ludicrous!
By God, it's impetuous!

1069
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:12,076
- So does that mean you gonna help us?
- Oh, it's on.

1070
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:36,206
Let Van stay! Let Van stay!

1071
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:39,041
Let Van stay! Let Van stay!

1072
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:44,042
We are now in session.
Mr. Wilder.

1073
01:13:44,153 --> 01:13:49,284
You were found in violation of Article
2, Section B of Coolidge's bylaws--

1074
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:51,723
soliciting of alcohol
to extreme minors...

1075
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:54,955
which is grounds
for immediate expulsion.

1076
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:57,190
You have opted to appeal.

1077
01:13:57,299 --> 01:13:58,664
The floor is yours.

1078
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:02,969
Ladies and gentlemen...

1079
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,305
as you know...

1080
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:13,313
I've been a student here
for seven years, and I've--

1081
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:16,145
Let Van stay!
Let Van stay!

1082
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,486
Order! Order!
Settle down, everyone.

1083
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:29,230
- Continue, Mr. Wilder.
- I'm okay.

1084
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:32,323
I've learned a lot here
at Coolidge.

1085
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:35,528
Let the record show that...

1086
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,332
when I attended class...

1087
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,431
I did receive exemplary marks.

1088
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:44,444
However, it was only when I met
a special someone...

1089
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:49,349
that I realized
what I was doing--

1090
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:51,783
hiding.

1091
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:55,220
See, after this is real life,
and I wasn't ready for that.

1092
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,224
I don't know why exactly.

1093
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,590
I do know that I don't wanna
end up like my father...

1094
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:01,595
whose whole life
revolves around work.

1095
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:03,756
But I see that now.

1096
01:15:03,866 --> 01:15:08,030
And I'm ready to move on.

1097
01:15:08,136 --> 01:15:10,696
Well, that's that. Good luck, loser.
Who's ready for lunch?

1098
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:13,536
- Mr. Bagg, you will be quiet.
- What's any of this got to do with...

1099
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:17,100
that he's guilty of an infraction
that deserves expulsion?

1100
01:15:17,212 --> 01:15:18,645
Mr. Wilder.

1101
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:26,750
I can't argue
against the infraction.

1102
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:30,154
I was responsible for that party,
so what happened was my fault.

1103
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:32,557
I'm here to lay myself
at the mercy of this court...

1104
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:35,494
and suggest an alternative punishment.

1105
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:37,258
Make me graduate.

1106
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,732
If you'll kindly take
a look at my transcripts...

1107
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:43,430
you'll see I'm 18 units from graduating
with a leisure studies degree.

1108
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:46,667
I am pleading to this committee,
reinstate me.

1109
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:49,141
Let me audit my last six classes,
take the finals...

1110
01:15:49,244 --> 01:15:51,474
and leave Coolidge with a degree.

1111
01:15:55,984 --> 01:16:00,318
God, I've bled...

1112
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:03,789
crimson and blue
for nearly a decade.

1113
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:07,692
This school has given me so much.
Let me repay Coolidge...

1114
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:10,663
by parting ways as a graduate.

1115
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:24,142
What are the courses
Mr. Wilder needs in order to graduate?

1116
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:27,044
Biology, English Lit,
Calculus, Economics...

1117
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:29,447
- Sociology and Political Science.
- Wow.

1118
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:32,952
- That's quite a load.
- Well, Van can handle quite a load.

1119
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:38,957
If we expel him, there could be
some sort of a coup d'état.

1120
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:41,621
He broke a rule.
He should pay the consequences.

1121
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:43,129
Well, let's take a vote.

1122
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:45,324
There's five of us here.
Majority rules.

1123
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:47,529
I vote reinstatement.

1124
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:50,400
- Mr. Bagg?
- Expulsion.

1125
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:52,473
Miss Haver?

1126
01:16:52,574 --> 01:16:53,700
Reinstatement...

1127
01:16:53,809 --> 01:16:55,743
over and over.

1128
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:58,369
Okay. Mrs. Seay?

1129
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,538
Expulsion.

1130
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:01,809
Professor McDoogle?

1131
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:04,545
You know, I've waited a long, long time
for this day to come.

1132
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:06,143
Either way...

1133
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:08,984
Van Wilder's tenure here
at Coolidge is over.

1134
01:17:13,929 --> 01:17:15,829
Let's see what
the kid's made of.

1135
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,064
He's in! He's in!

1136
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:32,409
- Hey, Jeannie.
- Look.

1137
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:35,347
I just wanted to explain about
the whole, you know, Richard thing.

1138
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:38,578
Me and Richard's unspoken bond blossomed
the other night in one beautiful...

1139
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,746
symbiotic act.

1140
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:43,450
- What sort of act?
- Messing up that Van Wilder party.

1141
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,924
And then we bumped uglies.

1142
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:49,190
It was the best ten seconds ever.

1143
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:52,293
Ever.

1144
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:55,603
Yes, these interviews
are somewhat of a formality...

1145
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:59,435
but I think it's crucial we like-minded
people get to know one another.

1146
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,547
- I knew you'd come to your senses.
- Hello, Richard.

1147
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:10,948
Look. I know we have a lot of surgery
to perform on our relationship.

1148
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:14,045
But right now I am prepping
for the biggest moment of our lives.

1149
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:19,059
I have a written exam first, and then an
interview with five Northwestern alums.

1150
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:20,560
All doctors.

1151
01:18:20,662 --> 01:18:23,256
That's why I came--
to help make you your shake.

1152
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:25,560
- That'd be terrific, Gwenny.
- I'll see you downstairs.

1153
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:30,665
But hurry. Interview's in a half hour,
other side of campus.

1154
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:34,631
Sorry about that.

1155
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:45,180
Northwestern.
I am the shit.

1156
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:47,346
You certainly will be.

1157
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:49,583
Gwenny, thank you.

1158
01:18:54,796 --> 01:18:57,594
Good luck, honey.
You deserve it.

1159
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:07,502
I certainly do.

1160
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:12,670
Cytosine.

1161
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:14,469
Nothin' but net, my man.

1162
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:18,410
Now remember, before any final,
take a pregame dump.

1163
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:36,997
Thanks for coming in.
You did a great job, really.

1164
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:40,090
Richard!
I was just talking about you.

1165
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:42,762
Hey, surprise.
I'm on your oral exam board.

1166
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:45,669
Look, come in here. I want you to meet
your future alumni.

1167
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:47,708
- I gotta go--
- No, come on. It's a great time.

1168
01:20:47,809 --> 01:20:49,868
Look, it's Richard.

1169
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:53,880
Finished his written exam in only
20 minutes. This kid is a dynamo.

1170
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:56,382
Richard,
I want you to meet Dr. Stern.

1171
01:20:56,484 --> 01:20:57,473
Dr. Fine.

1172
01:20:57,586 --> 01:21:01,386
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Bagg.
I've heard a lot about you.

1173
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:05,425
- Dr. Brown.
- This is something of a formality.

1174
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:08,325
We just want to
get to know you better.

1175
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:10,898
And Dr. Smelnick.

1176
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:14,163
Richard, is there something
you want to say?

1177
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:16,669
You look like you want
to get something out, son.

1178
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,002
Oh, my God!

1179
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:32,110
- Vile.
- Oh, it burns!

1180
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:36,989
I'm bleeding!

1181
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:39,649
Dear God, that's wretched.

1182
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:06,448
"Oh, I kept the first
for another day.

1183
01:22:06,554 --> 01:22:09,455
Yet knowing how way
leads on to way...

1184
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:12,549
I doubted if I should
ever come back."

1185
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:15,687
I want you to tell me what
Robert Frost was trying to express here.

1186
01:22:15,797 --> 01:22:18,061
I'm gonna need at least
one more booklet.

1187
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:21,167
- What?
- In other school news...

1188
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:23,794
we have an update
on the "Wilder Watch."

1189
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:27,102
The rigorous day has been
a success for Van the man.

1190
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:31,702
Five finals in the can with Professor
McDoogle's advanced econ final to go.

1191
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:37,713
Van! Van, wake up,
wake up, wake up.

1192
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:40,344
- Your final's in exactly seven minutes!
- All right.

1193
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,728
It's the moment of truth, people.

1194
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:13,677
I'm so glad you could fit us
into your schedule this morning.

1195
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:16,018
Wouldn't miss it
for the world, sir.

1196
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:19,254
All right.

1197
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:22,421
Pass these out.
Thank you.

1198
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:45,718
It's getting to be
that time of the hour.

1199
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:54,057
And your time is up, Mr. Wilder.
Pencils down.

1200
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:00,728
- Thank you.
- For four years...

1201
01:24:00,835 --> 01:24:02,962
I have been grooming myself
for the real world.

1202
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:07,531
l, like many, define the real world
as stuff that happens after graduation.

1203
01:24:07,642 --> 01:24:12,238
But I was wrong. It took a man by
the name of Van Wilder to teach me that.

1204
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:15,043
You've all undoubtedly
been to one of Van's parties.

1205
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:18,381
He's probably touched your life
in some way, whether you know it or not.

1206
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:20,954
Watch Van do belly flops
into a pool...

1207
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:25,755
but make sure you see he's raised $5,000
to give the swim team a next season.

1208
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:29,023
As you're all aware,
Van was almost expelled.

1209
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:31,223
What you probably
don't know is that he was set up...

1210
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:33,232
by a pathetic, egomaniacal frat boy...

1211
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:36,497
one who this reporter knows firsthand
to have a serious problem...

1212
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:39,437
with premature ejaculation.

1213
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:41,907
And in reaction
to this lynching...

1214
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:45,571
Van put in more effort in six days
than most have all semester.

1215
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:50,344
Win or lose, we should thank him for
reminding us what we're all capable of.

1216
01:24:50,452 --> 01:24:52,613
That's simply what he does--

1217
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,553
he inspires the uninspired.

1218
01:25:00,495 --> 01:25:04,056
Van. Hurry. The night of fun
and fornication's upon us.

1219
01:25:04,165 --> 01:25:06,065
Hey, have you heard from Gwen?

1220
01:25:07,168 --> 01:25:09,398
No, she--
she hasn't yet called back.

1221
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:12,302
Right.
I'll be down in a minute, okay?

1222
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:14,637
- Okay.
- See ya, V.

1223
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:39,164
Jesus.
This is some pad you got here.

1224
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:41,497
Decorated in early fuck.

1225
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:49,638
Well, I made it a point
to personally come down here, Wilder.

1226
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:51,905
I wanted to give you the results
of your test firsthand.

1227
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:54,413
And just as I expected...

1228
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:57,107
you succeeded.

1229
01:25:57,218 --> 01:26:00,449
- Ninety-one per cent.
- What?

1230
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:03,682
I'm proud of you, Wilder.

1231
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:06,453
I've been waiting all these years
for you to realize your potential.

1232
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:08,461
That's why you and I
had friction?

1233
01:26:08,563 --> 01:26:11,691
I thought it was 'cause I fooled around
with your daughter freshman year.

1234
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:15,965
Why? What-- You fooled around
with my daughter?

1235
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:18,266
What?

1236
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:36,556
Hey, I know you.

1237
01:26:36,658 --> 01:26:38,990
- Thank you very much.
- You're the best, Van.

1238
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:41,527
Hey, I couldn't have did it
without you. Appreciate it.

1239
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:45,497
I need you to fill this up with ice.
Pack as much as you can inside.

1240
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,899
- Okay? Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1241
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:53,805
My name is
Orissa Punjab Nizamabad.

1242
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:57,571
I've just transferred here
from Banglapur.

1243
01:27:07,288 --> 01:27:09,051
Excuse me.
Can you tell me...

1244
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:11,717
where I might find
the raddest fucking dude alive?

1245
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:14,124
Yeah, by the pool, Gramps.

1246
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:18,461
Hey, I know you, man!
Oh, fuck.

1247
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:21,501
Congratulations, Van.
I knew you had it in you.

1248
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:26,840
Dad! I can't believe
you're here.

1249
01:27:26,941 --> 01:27:28,875
I can't believe you graduated.

1250
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:30,672
A friend of yours...

1251
01:27:30,778 --> 01:27:32,973
sent me this.

1252
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:37,885
I'm proud of you, Van,
graduation or no graduation.

1253
01:27:37,986 --> 01:27:40,819
Thank you.
And I'm sorry that I spent...

1254
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:44,255
such a buttload
of your money for so long.

1255
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:47,692
It's by far the best investment
I ever made.

1256
01:27:57,505 --> 01:28:01,100
- You did good.
- Let's get this man "leid."

1257
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:03,643
Meet my new girl.

1258
01:28:20,094 --> 01:28:22,654
You look so--

1259
01:28:22,764 --> 01:28:24,254
Wow.

1260
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:27,391
- Wow.
- I was hoping you'd say that.

1261
01:28:35,677 --> 01:28:39,272
- May I?
- As long as we cuddle afterwards.

1262
01:28:43,584 --> 01:28:47,918
There's so much
that I need to say-- the article--

1263
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:58,021
I was scared
that you wouldn't come.

1264
01:28:58,132 --> 01:29:01,124
Well, I was trying to decide
what panties I should wear.

1265
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:04,028
Which ones did you choose?

1266
01:29:04,906 --> 01:29:06,601
None.

1267
01:29:54,355 --> 01:29:56,516
It's gonna be a bachelor party.

1268
01:29:56,624 --> 01:29:59,525
One last night of debauchery
with the fellas.

1269
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:11,531
You can't even--

1270
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:13,630
I mean, this girl is--

1271
01:30:15,143 --> 01:30:18,476
- I was wondering--
- I'll do it.

1272
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:25,944
I'm getting my shit together.
Just one second.

1273
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:28,312
I can't do this!

1274
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:40,857
Oh, man. My mama never told me
I'd be doing this.

1275
01:30:43,004 --> 01:30:44,938
I want to chew the--

1276
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:47,132
And then--
I don't know how.

1277
01:30:56,517 --> 01:31:01,079
Kids, this is what white jockey
blowin' hookers will do to you.
