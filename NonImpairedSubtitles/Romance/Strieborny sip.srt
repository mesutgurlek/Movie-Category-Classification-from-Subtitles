1
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,173
- Yes, sir. Where to?
- It's the train to Chicago. The Silver Streak.

2
00:00:32,173 --> 00:00:34,979
- Silver Streak. I'll take care of your bags, sir.
- Thank you.

3
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:38,613
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Thanks

4
00:00:49,499 --> 00:00:52,366
What are those conventioneers
doing up at the baggage car?

5
00:00:53,536 --> 00:00:55,265
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Now, ain't that somethin'?

6
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:57,772
I thought it was bad enough with the
hippies on board. Now we got their fathers.

7
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:03,270
Oh, we had to get Mary Lou.

8
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,339
- She's our date for the party.
- Come on, Conductor! Let's get this show on the track!

9
00:01:07,339 --> 00:01:09,281
Oh, ho, ho.
I beg your pardon, sir.

10
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:12,780
Hello. Am I in the right place?

11
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,825
First class. Yes, sir.
Right this way.

12
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,553
Watch your step there.

13
00:01:29,638 --> 00:01:31,697
- This is your room here, sir.
- Okay, thanks a lot.

14
00:01:31,697 --> 00:01:33,434
- Thank you, sir. Have a pleasant trip.
- Bye-bye.

15
00:01:33,434 --> 00:01:38,241
Sir, you think you're gonna be needin'
all these bags up here? If not, I can store
some of'em down at the other end.

16
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:41,111
- Sure, sure. All I need is this one and that one.
- Okay.

17
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:43,082
- You can take this. I'll keep the briefcase.
- I'll take that.

18
00:01:43,082 --> 00:01:44,482


19
00:01:44,482 --> 00:01:47,181
- Is this the bed?
- Yeah. I'll be makin' that up a little later on.

20
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:49,087
Okay, thanks.

21
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:52,320
- And this is...
- Your lavatory and sink, sir.

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,056
- Nice, big room.
- Very convenient.

23
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:58,394
- What's this partition?
- Oh, that turns the room into a double suite..

24
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:01,526
We used to have a lot of calls for 'em...
from the honeymooners.

25
00:02:01,526 --> 00:02:03,229
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:07,172
I'm not doing it on purpose.
This latch seems to be stuck.

27
00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:10,537
Everything's changed.
Did you say something?

28
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,176
No! No. I-I agree with everything you said.
All I wanna do is take it easy.

29
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,412
Good, good. Then just settle back
and enjoy the trip.

30
00:02:18,412 --> 00:02:22,047
Because it ain't gonna be too exciting,
now, but we'll get you there on time.

31
00:02:22,047 --> 00:02:23,818
- Okay. Have a nice rest.
- Thanks a lot.

32
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:25,825
- Bye-bye.
- Good evening.

33
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,660
Board!

34
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,816
So long, L.A.! Bye!

35
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:58,576
Do you like this perfume?

36
00:03:58,576 --> 00:04:00,583
I mix it myself.

37
00:04:02,854 --> 00:04:05,846
Lovely. Very nice.

38
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:17,690
That's something, huh?
Yes, sir.

39
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,963
We leave Los Angeles,

40
00:04:19,963 --> 00:04:23,006
and we go right up there to Nevada...

41
00:04:23,006 --> 00:04:25,598
into Colorado, across the Rockies...

42
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,041
up to Kansas City, Kansas.

43
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,308
Right in here's a town
called Ashland, Missouri.

44
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:36,080
Cross the big Mississippi.
Two and a half days, right up
there in Chicago, Illinois.

45
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,121
- That's some trip, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

46
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:39,917
- You from Chicago?
- No, Los Angeles.

47
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:42,015
I'm from Chicago.

48
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,753
My name is Bob Sweet.

49
00:04:43,753 --> 00:04:46,887
A sweet man, but a mean baby.

50
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,624
- George Caldwell.
- Yeah?

51
00:04:49,698 --> 00:04:52,258
Yeah, George,
what racket you in?

52
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,599
- Publishing.
- No kidding? Come on. Sit down here.
- Thanks.

53
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:58,401
You know, I'm in vitamins myself.

54
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:02,744
Mm-hmm. Here.
There's a sample for ya. Vitamin "E."

55
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:05,042
Now, that is great
for the old pecker.

56
00:05:07,716 --> 00:05:10,412
Yeah, it really keeps
the pencil sharp, and I'm not kiddin'.

57
00:05:10,412 --> 00:05:14,252
Have you had a chance yet
to check out the action?

58
00:05:14,252 --> 00:05:17,315
No. Actually, this is the first time
I've ever taken a train.

59
00:05:18,394 --> 00:05:20,328
- You're kidding me?
- No.

60
00:05:20,328 --> 00:05:21,048
Come on

61
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:24,865
- Well, you're in for the ride of your life.
- Oh, yeah?

62
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:29,961
You just pick out a little chickie, my friend...
and it's hug and munch all the way to Chicago.

63
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:33,263
- Really?
- I do it all the time.

64
00:05:33,263 --> 00:05:38,210
I tell my boss that I'm afraid of flying...
and I get this action twice a year.

65
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,705
It's a cathouse on wheels.

66
00:05:41,705 --> 00:05:43,876
No... Hey, listen.
Come on.

67
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:48,651
It's something about the movement
of the train that does it.
All that motion makes a girl horny.

68
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:53,891
Well, I'll tell you, Bob. I'm not really
interested in a shipboard romance.

69
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:56,522
- I took the train to rest and get a lot
of reading done.
- Hold it, hold it.

70
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:01,394
Right there, George.
I believe I see my chickie for tonight.

71
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:07,771
Hi, there. Can I, uh,
buy you a drink?

72
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:12,568
- I have one. Thank you.
- Well, I'll just, uh, join you then, huh?

73
00:06:12,568 --> 00:06:14,739
That's an old-fashioned, bartender.

74
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,079
- You go all the way?
- What?

75
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:30,597
I said, do you go all the way...
to Chicago?

76
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:35,059
Oh. Yes, I do.

77
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:43,137
- Well, then maybe we can do it together.
- Do what?

78
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:48,140
- Go to Chicago.
I mean, you know, we're gonna be, uh...

79
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,274
stuck on this train together,

80
00:06:51,274 --> 00:06:53,250
and we can't jump off.

81
00:06:55,755 --> 00:06:57,848
Do you feel that motion?

82
00:07:05,064 --> 00:07:06,964
Are you hot?

83
00:07:06,964 --> 00:07:07,684
What?

84
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:11,235
I said, are you hot?

85
00:07:13,872 --> 00:07:16,568
Lady, I am always hot.

86
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,708
Maybe I can cool you down.

87
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:11,922
How's the latch? May I?

88
00:08:11,922 --> 00:08:14,021
Yes. Please, sit down.

89
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:17,158
What a nice surprise.

90
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:22,000
I said, how's the latch?
We have connecting rooms.

91
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,904
The latch. Good.
It's good. It's fine. Thank you.

92
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:29,206
It's a little bit rusty, but nothing serious.
I'll get the porter to look at it.

93
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:32,704
There's no rush, is there?

94
00:08:36,085 --> 00:08:37,882
Would you folks like a cocktail?

95
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:41,515
Uh, a martini on the rocks
with a twist.

96
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:45,784
- Two.
- Yes, sir.

97
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:52,532
- My name is George Caldwell.
- Hilly Burns.

98
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:57,968
That's short for Hildegard.
What's that pencil for?

99
00:08:57,968 --> 00:09:01,567
Oh, you have to fill out
your own menu card.

100
00:09:04,012 --> 00:09:08,381
"One macedoine of fruit,
beef Oriental, rice, carrots...

101
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,078
coffee, apple pie a la mode. "

102
00:09:12,154 --> 00:09:13,644
You print very well.

103
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,479
Thanks.

104
00:09:17,492 --> 00:09:20,222
I'll have the same thing.
You do it for me.

105
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:25,728
I can't even read my own writing.

106
00:09:25,728 --> 00:09:28,928
I don't do shorthand,
and I can't type.

107
00:09:28,928 --> 00:09:30,994
What do you do for a living?

108
00:09:30,994 --> 00:09:32,903
I'm a secretary.

109
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:37,076
- Well, how do you keep your job?
- I give great phone.

110
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,042
I have a terrific personality.

111
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:46,815
- You going to Chicago?
- Yes.

112
00:09:46,815 --> 00:09:49,651
I'm going to my sister's wedding.

113
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:52,090
How come you're taking the train?
You afraid of flying?

114
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,526
No, I'm not afraid of flying.

115
00:09:55,526 --> 00:09:59,862
I, uh... I just want to be bored.

116
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,230
And you?

117
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,537
Oh, my new boss
likes the old-fashioned ways.

118
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,108
He's just written a book
on Rembrandt...

119
00:10:13,108 --> 00:10:16,376
and he's gonna kick off his publicity
campaign with a lecture at the Art Institute.

120
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:18,747
Oh, yes? I'm in publishing.
What's his name?

121
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:21,252
Professor Arthur Schreiner.
Have you heard of him?

122
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,654
Most people haven't.

123
00:10:25,654 --> 00:10:29,593
He's, um... He's been a recluse
working on this book for about  20  years.

124
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:32,153
- Where is he now?
- Oh, he's in bed...

125
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:35,599
with a glass of hot milk and molasses.
He's a health nut.

126
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:39,159
- What do you publish?
- Oh, mostly nonfiction.

127
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:42,298
Gardening, cook books,
how-to-do-it books.

128
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,800
Like sex manuals?

129
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:50,671
- I've edited a few.
- An authority, huh?

130
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,750
I know what goes where...
and why.

131
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,454
- That's very interesting. Are you married?
- Divorced.

132
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,089
How come?

133
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,494
My friends all told me that
my wife was too good for me...

134
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:15,562
and after a couple of years
I decided they were right.

135
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:18,375
Sounds sad.

136
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:24,442
You say that your boss is in art history.
Is that what you're interested in?

137
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:27,916
Not really.

138
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:31,477
just got this job because
I was available. I was willing to travel.

139
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,893
- Would you like some wine with this meal?
- Oh, what a question.

140
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:43,126
Um, we'll have a bottle
of the Mouton Cadet.

141
00:11:46,503 --> 00:11:47,993
Very good, sir.

142
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,234
- You do that very well.
- I give great French.

143
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:21,099
- He'll never talk.
- We gotta find those papers.

144
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:22,603
Come on.
We'll look in his compartment.

145
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:29,476
So that was your introduction
to high society?

146
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,648
Look, he was very good to me.

147
00:12:33,648 --> 00:12:36,708
He taught me everything
from the pill to Picasso.

148
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,047
- What was missing?
- A marriage license.

149
00:12:41,924 --> 00:12:43,448
Is that what you want?

150
00:12:45,227 --> 00:12:47,161
I did then.

151
00:12:48,497 --> 00:12:50,397
Right now, I'd like some more
champagne.

152
00:12:56,871 --> 00:13:00,034
- Uh-oh. Shall I get another bottle?
- Two.

153
00:13:04,112 --> 00:13:06,774
This place seems to be closing down.

154
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,076
Why don't we take our glasses...

155
00:13:12,076 --> 00:13:14,621
and go to our rooms?

156
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,058
We could even open
the connecting door.

157
00:13:22,297 --> 00:13:24,231
We could even break down
the whole partition.

158
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,726
- I'll speak to the porter.
- I'll get the champagne.

159
00:13:44,851 --> 00:13:46,944
You were right.
It's that motion.

160
00:13:46,944 --> 00:13:49,352
I didn't understand it,
but you were right.

161
00:13:52,326 --> 00:13:53,657
Good night.

162
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:11,699
- Rapist!
- No, no, no, no!

163
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,760
Pardonez-moi, por favor.

164
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:33,221
Excuse me.

165
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,995
Um, this won't take a minute.

166
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:38,426
Good.

167
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,806
Excellent. These are all right.

168
00:14:41,806 --> 00:14:43,306
Sorry. Good evening.

169
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:55,339
Come in.

170
00:15:04,229 --> 00:15:06,390
This is very nice.

171
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:10,425
- Would you like some champagne?
- Yes.

172
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:13,834
I can't get over the size of this room
without the partition.

173
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:20,043
They are small rooms by themselves.
They're perfect forjuggling.

174
00:15:20,043 --> 00:15:21,507
- For what?
- For juggling.

175
00:15:21,507 --> 00:15:24,410
When you practice, the balls would
always bounce off the walls.

176
00:15:26,682 --> 00:15:28,741
Do you juggle a lot?

177
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:32,078
I know what goes where and why.

178
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:42,054
I like that song.

179
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:47,701
If I ever hear it again...
it'll be difficult not to think of you.

180
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:52,863
- You put that very nicely.
- Thanks.

181
00:16:02,217 --> 00:16:04,947
To traveling by train.

182
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:07,386
Trains that pass in the night.

183
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:28,439
You like my new shoes?

184
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:31,706
- Yes, I do.
- Why don't you take them off?

185
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:35,909
You can put them in that little locker over there...
and the porter will have them shined for you
in the morning.

186
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:38,975
- Really?
- That's terrific.

187
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:46,416
- Is that the master's work?
- Mm-hmm.

188
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:51,123
He gave me this copy
for safe keeping.

189
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:53,828
Do you want to read it?

190
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,760
Slide over.

191
00:17:33,572 --> 00:17:35,563
It's beautiful, isn't it?

192
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:38,236
Very.

193
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,392
Do you really edit sex manuals?

194
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:00,191
I really, really do.

195
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,661
But I have a confession to make.

196
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:07,932
I'm much better
at books on gardening.

197
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:10,997
- Really?
- That's my specialty.

198
00:18:13,511 --> 00:18:15,172
Well...

199
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:20,574
is there anything that
you might wanna pass on?

200
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,516
- You mean about gardening?
- Yes.

201
00:18:26,324 --> 00:18:30,158
Some helpful hints
for the beginner.

202
00:18:31,662 --> 00:18:33,323
Well...

203
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,659
One tip is...

204
00:18:38,736 --> 00:18:41,670
always be nasty to nasturtiums.

205
00:18:43,106 --> 00:18:45,336
- Is that so?
- They love that.

206
00:18:45,336 --> 00:18:48,707
- They like it rough?
- The rougher, the better.

207
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:50,370
Great.

208
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,318
What else should I know?

209
00:18:57,687 --> 00:19:00,656
I could teach you the secret
of how to treat azaleas.

210
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:02,783
Oh, tell me.
I'm all ears.

211
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,157
I can see that.

212
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:06,752
Well...

213
00:19:07,631 --> 00:19:11,089
just treat them the same way
as you would a begonia.

214
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:14,762
- No kidding?
- That's gospel.

215
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:18,568
You mean what you're saying is what's
good for azaleas is good for begonias?

216
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:22,407
- You got it.
- George, this is fascinating.

217
00:19:22,407 --> 00:19:24,912
I thought you'd be interested.

218
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:27,642
I'd like to delve deeper.

219
00:19:27,642 --> 00:19:30,617
- Be my guest.
- Thank you.

220
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,931
What would happen if you treated
an azalea like a nasturtium?

221
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,031
Now, this is the really interesting part.

222
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,118
- What is it, George?
- Did you see it? Did you see that man?

223
00:20:08,118 --> 00:20:11,556
- What man?
- There was a man
hanging outside this window.

224
00:20:11,556 --> 00:20:14,390
- He was shot in the head.
- What?

225
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,159
Hilly, a dead man
fell off the roof.

226
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,963
I saw it. His coat was stuck.

227
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,373
Oh. I should do something.

228
00:20:29,373 --> 00:20:32,537
I should report it.
Maybe they could stop the train.

229
00:20:32,537 --> 00:20:35,513
George, I'm sure
you saw something.

230
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:39,109
You probably saw a kid's kite
or an old newspaper out...

231
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:43,520
Look! Like that. You see, George,
it could have been anything out there.

232
00:20:44,758 --> 00:20:47,192
But his eyes were so clear.

233
00:20:48,261 --> 00:20:50,695
I think they were clearer
than your head.

234
00:20:50,695 --> 00:20:53,528
- You imagined this, George.
- I didn't. I know I didn't.

235
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:56,660
Then why don't you call the conductor
and tell him your story?

236
00:20:58,672 --> 00:21:01,970
- I feel dizzy.
- You know what? Here.

237
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,032
Lie down here, George.

238
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:10,378
Whew! If this is what
the D.T. S are like...

239
00:21:10,378 --> 00:21:13,646
I'm gonna give up
the bottle for life.

240
00:21:13,646 --> 00:21:19,021
The mind plays funny tricks
on you all the time.

241
00:21:19,021 --> 00:21:23,824
You know that, George.
Come on. Relax. It's okay. Relax

242
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:28,422
That sure is a pretty song.

243
00:21:29,135 --> 00:21:31,069
Yes, it is.

244
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:37,800
You're very beautiful, Hilly.

245
00:21:41,446 --> 00:21:43,277
I like you too, George.

246
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:04,349
Hilly, wake up.

247
00:23:05,895 --> 00:23:07,226
Hi, George.

248
00:23:07,226 --> 00:23:12,233
Hilly, the man that I saw outside
the window last night... this is him.

249
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:16,533
- That's my boss. That's Professor Schreiner.
- I know it. That's what I'm talking about.

250
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:18,540
- What time is it, George?
- It's just after 8:00.

251
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,703
8:00? Oh, no. Wake me up again
when it's after 10:00.

252
00:23:22,703 --> 00:23:24,335
Hilly, this man
has been murdered.

253
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:27,846
- Well...

254
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:32,910
Why don't you go down the hall
and discuss it with him?

255
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,115
And then come back here
and discuss it with me.

256
00:23:35,115 --> 00:23:38,591
He's just right past
the diner, room "C."

257
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:40,184
Hilly, I didn't imagine it.

258
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:44,924
Good night, George.
You're a wonderful gardener.

259
00:24:16,697 --> 00:24:18,289
- Rapist.
- Oh!

260
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:23,599
Hey, George, you devil.
Come on. Join me for coffee.

261
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:27,334
All right. I'll be right back.
I just have to check on something.

262
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,302
What is that?

263
00:24:47,427 --> 00:24:49,452
Yeah? What do you want?

264
00:24:49,452 --> 00:24:51,997
I'd like to see
Professor Schreiner, please.

265
00:24:51,997 --> 00:24:56,559
- Yeah? Who are you?
- My name is George Caldwell.

266
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,570
You a friend of the professor?

267
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,506
No, not exactly. I'm a friend of his secretary's.
We were a little worried about him.

268
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:05,438
Yeah? What are you worried about?

269
00:25:06,845 --> 00:25:09,109
Can't I talk to the professor?

270
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,308
What are you doing in there?

271
00:25:13,308 --> 00:25:15,819
I think you're sticking your nose in
where it don't belong.

272
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:18,185
You and that broad are gonna
get yourself in trouble.

273
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:20,520
In fact, she's already in trouble

274
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,152
- You're the one who's in trouble,
mister, not me.
- Reace!

275
00:25:23,152 --> 00:25:25,423
Get rid of this bum.

276
00:25:26,898 --> 00:25:28,832
What are you doing?
Who is that?

277
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:33,360
Hey! Listen, you big lummox,
let me go! What the hell are you doing?

278
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,805
Are you crazy?
What the hell's the matter with you?

279
00:25:36,805 --> 00:25:40,002
All right, listen, buster, you're in trouble...
and I mean big trouble,

280
00:25:40,002 --> 00:25:41,738
because I'm reporting you.

281
00:25:43,147 --> 00:25:46,514
Oh, no, you can't be serious.
Wait a minute. All right. Enough's enough.

282
00:25:46,514 --> 00:25:49,781
If you're willing to forget it...
I don't believe this! Are you kidding?

283
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,692
Goddamn it!

284
00:26:05,736 --> 00:26:07,995
Son of a bitch!

285
00:26:49,578 --> 00:26:51,239
This is terrific!

286
00:28:03,383 --> 00:28:07,979
- If that's you, Pepe, you're in one heap of trouble.
- No, it's not Pepe.

287
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:11,353
- Where's Pepe?
- I don't know. My name is George...

288
00:28:11,353 --> 00:28:14,860
Goddamn it, I knew it! He's gone off
again with that no accountin' Manuel.

289
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,897
- My name is George Caldwell.
- Those two get together, smoke a little weed.

290
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:21,092
Next thing you know, they're off
buzzing the turkeys in the pickup.

291
00:28:21,092 --> 00:28:23,568
- Excuse me, dear.
- I should've fired him 30 years ago.

292
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:26,037
Excuse me.
Do you think I could use your telephone?

293
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,835
- Telephone?
- Yes.

294
00:28:27,835 --> 00:28:31,071
- You ain't from around here, are you?
- No, I'm lost.

295
00:28:31,071 --> 00:28:33,668
I'm not lost, but I was
thrown off of the Silver Streak.

296
00:28:33,668 --> 00:28:35,475
Thrown off? That a fact?

297
00:28:35,475 --> 00:28:38,108
Tell me, is there a woman in this?

298
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:41,818
- Well, there's a girl, but...
- I knew it.

299
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:45,349
No, no, no. It's nothing to do
with what you're thinking.

300
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:49,554
Actually, she's in a great deal of danger.
That's why I have to use your telephone...

301
00:28:49,554 --> 00:28:51,755
so I can call the police and have those
people who threw me off the train arrested.

302
00:28:51,755 --> 00:28:55,426
- Well, it sounds like you're in an awful hurry.
- I am. That's what I'm trying to tell you.

303
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:58,595
That suits me just fine...
'cause I'm running a little bit late myself.

304
00:28:58,595 --> 00:29:02,198
- Tell you what, Steve.
- George. George Caldwell.

305
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,242
- Rita Babtree.
- How do you do?

306
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:08,746
If you'll finish milking old Harriet over there...
I'll go in and change and you can ride into town with me.

307
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:11,179
- Oh, great!
- The sheriff's a good friend of mine.

308
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:13,376
Wonderful. Just tell me
what I have to do.

309
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:16,648
Well, you just take
this bucket and milk her.

310
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:19,747
Milk her?
I've never milked a cow before.

311
00:29:19,747 --> 00:29:23,726
Cut the gas, Steve.
You're a grown man.

312
00:29:23,726 --> 00:29:25,990
I'm sure you've had
some similar experience.

313
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:30,490
Look, you just sit down...

314
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,059
take a tit in each hand and
let nature take its course.

315
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:34,365
All right.

316
00:29:34,365 --> 00:29:36,270
These cows are so full...

317
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,242
it's like tapping a trip valve
on Niagara Falls.

318
00:29:39,242 --> 00:29:42,210
- I'll go in and change and meet you
outside in 10 minutes.
- All right.

319
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,110
I'll do my best.

320
00:29:45,148 --> 00:29:46,672
Hello.

321
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:52,579
Let's see.

322
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,224
Just be nice.
Be nice.

323
00:29:56,224 --> 00:29:58,591
Wait a minute.

324
00:29:59,663 --> 00:30:02,791
Something's wrong.
You've got four of them.

325
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:09,195
Oop.! Come on, Harriet.
Come on. Give me a break.

326
00:30:10,741 --> 00:30:13,938
Nice, fresh milk.
Here it comes.

327
00:30:14,978 --> 00:30:18,777
Nothing's coming out though.
Here we go.

328
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:23,649
All right, now, I know I'm a slow
starter, but where's Niagara Falls?

329
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,615
Hey, Steve, whatcha doin'?

330
00:30:29,615 --> 00:30:32,661
I was just looking at my schedule
for the Silver Streak.

331
00:30:32,661 --> 00:30:35,128
No, I don't mean that. I mean...

332
00:30:35,128 --> 00:30:38,394
why are you sittin' in that car?
We ain't goin' in that.

333
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:41,061
- We aren't?
- No!

334
00:30:41,061 --> 00:30:44,573
Come on, Steve.
Follow me.

335
00:30:50,645 --> 00:30:53,580
Put these packages
in the front seat...

336
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,809
and I'll get the wheel blocks.

337
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:58,614
I sure hope Pepe
filled it with enough gas.

338
00:30:58,614 --> 00:31:00,922
We're not going in that, are we?

339
00:31:00,922 --> 00:31:03,421
What's the matter?
You afraid of flyin'?

340
00:31:03,421 --> 00:31:06,016
No, no.
I'm not afraid.

341
00:31:06,016 --> 00:31:09,859
Great, 'cause it ain't no fun
soarin' with a turkey.

342
00:31:16,404 --> 00:31:18,964
Look out for the windmill.
Look out for the windmill!

343
00:31:25,712 --> 00:31:28,681
- You okay with those packages?
- Yeah, I guess so.

344
00:31:28,681 --> 00:31:33,208
Well, it won't be long. We should be
in Stavely by 2:00.

345
00:31:34,621 --> 00:31:39,058
2:00? That's two and a half hours from now.
Where's Stavely?

346
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:42,253
Sixty miles
the other side of Albuquerque.

347
00:31:43,163 --> 00:31:45,324
- Wait a minute.
- What'd you say?

348
00:31:47,067 --> 00:31:50,400
The Silver Streak
stops there at 2:27.

349
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,065
If we got there by 2:00 the sheriff
could meet the train when it arrives.

350
00:31:54,065 --> 00:31:56,074
Yeah, I suppose so.

351
00:31:56,074 --> 00:31:59,077
- This is fabulous!
- Ain't it the truth?

352
00:31:59,077 --> 00:32:04,138
They talk of the joy of sex,
but it don't last like the fun of flyin'.

353
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:26,037
Look! There's the Silver Streak.!

354
00:32:45,723 --> 00:32:48,749
- I think we're going to make it.
- Look at those sheep down there.

355
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:52,887
Don't they make a lovely sight?
I'm just itchin'to buzz 'em.

356
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,488
To do what?

357
00:32:54,488 --> 00:32:57,398
- You never buzzed sheep?
- I don't think so.

358
00:32:57,398 --> 00:32:59,595
Hold on, Steve!
We're going in!

359
00:33:12,182 --> 00:33:14,173
Look at those little critters run.!

360
00:33:17,187 --> 00:33:20,088
Come on.! Let's buzz 'em again.!
Whoo-hoo.!

361
00:33:32,736 --> 00:33:34,931
Here we are.

362
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:38,133
- Hello, Rita.
- Hi, Burt. Is the sheriff in?

363
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:40,574
- He's over at Clancey's Dairy.
He'll be back in about...

364
00:33:40,574 --> 00:33:42,908
Look!
There's the Silver Streak.!

365
00:33:43,979 --> 00:33:46,641
- Thank you. Thank you, Rita.
- Don't you wanna go get the sheriff?

366
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:50,811
- No time! Thank you, dear. Good-bye.!
- So long, Steve.

367
00:33:57,259 --> 00:34:00,524
This time, try to stay on!

368
00:34:00,524 --> 00:34:02,563
Come on! Come on!

369
00:34:02,563 --> 00:34:05,361
Jump up! Jump!

370
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:08,827
You got it!

371
00:34:09,939 --> 00:34:11,736
All right!

372
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,103
Hey, welcome aboard.

373
00:34:19,103 --> 00:34:21,910
- Don't you just love train travel?
- I love it.

374
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,610
- Loves it.

375
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:59,608
I asked you to join me for breakfast.
This is lunch.

376
00:34:59,608 --> 00:35:01,881
Sorry. I lost track of time.

377
00:35:04,558 --> 00:35:06,685
Well, what were you doin' back there?

378
00:35:06,685 --> 00:35:08,751
Gettin' a little ass?

379
00:35:09,663 --> 00:35:11,858
No, I was squeezing tits.

380
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:16,162
You are a sexy devil, aren't you?

381
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:19,964
Kind of worked up a sweat too,
didn't ya, you horny bastard?

382
00:35:24,344 --> 00:35:26,005
Well, what do you expect?

383
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:28,410
I mean, she's a hot little number.

384
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,711
And he's very heavy competition.

385
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,774
You know him?

386
00:35:32,774 --> 00:35:36,117
Doesn't everybody know him?
That's Roger Devereau.

387
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:39,955
He's Chicago's own jet-setter.

388
00:35:39,955 --> 00:35:43,018
I mean, you know, he's a big cheese on
the Art Institute, something like that.

389
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:45,620
Like I say, very heavy competition.

390
00:35:46,465 --> 00:35:48,228
Are you gonna take him on?

391
00:36:42,586 --> 00:36:44,349
Are you all right?

392
00:36:50,394 --> 00:36:52,055
What's the matter?

393
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:56,998
- Honey, what's the matter?
- What's the matter?

394
00:36:58,168 --> 00:36:59,829
Who left who?

395
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:03,669
Last time I saw you, you were
gonna go visit the professor.

396
00:37:03,669 --> 00:37:06,539
- Hilly, the professor is dead.
I'm sure of it.

397
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:08,043
Listen to me.

398
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:10,478
I went to his room
this morning, and he wasn't there.

399
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,640
Two dumb thugs
were looking through his things.

400
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,708
They pushed me out of his room
and threw me off the train.

401
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:19,380
-Threw you off?
-The point is they were searching for something.

402
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,118
I don't know what, but they've killed
the professor for it and now I'm
positive they're gonna go after you

403
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:26,320
We've gotta get off the train
and contact the police.

404
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,991
- No, George, you've got it all mixed up.
- I don't have it mixed up.

405
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:32,227
I'm just worried about you.

406
00:37:37,807 --> 00:37:39,934
Hello, Roger.

407
00:37:39,934 --> 00:37:42,739
This is my friend George Caldwell.
Roger Devereau.

408
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:48,042
- How do you do?
- George has just been telling me
how he'd been thrown off the train.

409
00:37:49,117 --> 00:37:53,281
Oh, you're the one? I'm so pleased
to see you. Are you all right?

410
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:55,152
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Oh, that's good news.

411
00:37:55,152 --> 00:37:58,681
As soon as I was told,
I contacted the police in Albuquerque...

412
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:01,991
and told them to spare no expense
to make sure you were safe.

413
00:38:01,991 --> 00:38:05,261
Reace... he's like a child... got off
the train and tried to find you...

414
00:38:05,261 --> 00:38:06,995
say he was sorry.

415
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:09,560
- How did you get back on?
- Who's Reace?

416
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,731
He's the one that threw you off.

417
00:38:13,342 --> 00:38:17,574
You must remember him... a large man
with not very attractive dental work.

418
00:38:17,574 --> 00:38:20,513
I do remember,
but what does he got to do with you?

419
00:38:20,513 --> 00:38:22,845
He works for me.
He's my chauffeur.

420
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:25,442
Not very bright,
but extremely loyal.

421
00:38:25,442 --> 00:38:29,649
And naturally, I assume total
responsibility for all his actions...

422
00:38:29,649 --> 00:38:32,591
and will pay for any damages.

423
00:38:32,591 --> 00:38:35,527
And what about that other fellow?

424
00:38:35,527 --> 00:38:38,895
I met another man this morning.
Does he work for you too?

425
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,295
Oh, yes, of course.
You don't know the entire story, do you?

426
00:38:43,295 --> 00:38:47,808
Early this morning, I was having
breakfast with Professor Schreiner...

427
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:51,971
and he wanted to show me some
important papers connected with his book.

428
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:54,446
But, unfortunately, they were missing

429
00:38:54,446 --> 00:38:57,642
So we searched
his compartment twice...

430
00:38:57,642 --> 00:39:01,084
and eventually we discovered them
in his trunk in the baggage room.

431
00:39:01,084 --> 00:39:04,914
t was something of an upset,
but if you know the professor....

432
00:39:04,914 --> 00:39:08,193
you'll know he's slightly
absent-minded.

433
00:39:08,193 --> 00:39:10,229
Mr. Devereau, I'm very confused.

434
00:39:10,229 --> 00:39:13,493
I don't understand how you could've
had breakfast with Professor Schreiner.

435
00:39:13,493 --> 00:39:16,296
George thinks
the professor's been murdered.

436
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:21,266
- Murdered?
- That's right, last night.

437
00:39:21,266 --> 00:39:23,138
That's extraordinary.
Why should you think that?

438
00:39:23,138 --> 00:39:27,873
Because I saw him fall off the roof
of this train just outside this window.

439
00:39:27,873 --> 00:39:31,143
- He was shot in the head.
- You were in this compartment?

440
00:39:31,143 --> 00:39:33,548
I was lying right here.

441
00:39:34,853 --> 00:39:38,050
Hilly, you'll have to go back to
my compartment, straighten it out.

442
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,490
That man Whiney doesn't know
what he's doing. Devereau.

443
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:44,688
Mr. Caldwell, allow me to introduce
Professor Schreiner.

444
00:39:44,688 --> 00:39:46,993
Professor Schreiner, Mr. Caldwell.

445
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:49,898
- Hello.
- How do you do?

446
00:39:49,898 --> 00:39:51,697
What did you do to your jacket?

447
00:39:51,697 --> 00:39:56,139
Mr. Caldwell is the man that Reace
inadvertently threw off the train.

448
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:58,642
Oh, yes.

449
00:39:58,642 --> 00:40:03,443
That stupid person.
I do hope you weren't hurt.

450
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,482
No, no.
I'm all right.

451
00:40:05,482 --> 00:40:09,350
I suppose I'm to blame
for this morning's fracas.

452
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:13,857
After all, none of this would've happened
if I hadn't misplaced the Rembrandt letters.

453
00:40:13,857 --> 00:40:14,577
The what?

454
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:20,020
It doesn't matter. I'm so glad that you're
all right and managed to get back on the train.

455
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,225
Oh, Professor? Professor,
I put back as much... I put back...

456
00:40:24,368 --> 00:40:26,928
Hey, how'd you get here?

457
00:40:26,928 --> 00:40:31,498
Mr. Caldwell, allow me to introduce
an associate of mine, Mr. Whiney.

458
00:40:31,498 --> 00:40:34,977
If an apology is due, I'm sure
that he'd be prepared to make it.

459
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:38,072
It's a pity that Reace
is not here to do the same.

460
00:40:38,072 --> 00:40:40,582
Reace, that moron.
It was all his fault.

461
00:40:40,582 --> 00:40:43,380
I was looking for the papers.
I never touched you, did I?

462
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,216
- No, no.
- See?

463
00:40:45,216 --> 00:40:50,055
It's been very hectic for me.
I think I'll have a scotch and lie down.

464
00:40:50,055 --> 00:40:54,654
- Why don't you use my compartment?
- Thank you. I will.

465
00:40:54,654 --> 00:40:57,757
Hilly...
will you help him with that mess?

466
00:40:58,502 --> 00:41:01,528
Mr. Caldwell,
it's been nice meeting you.

467
00:41:01,528 --> 00:41:04,836
I hope the rest of the trip for both
of us is a little less exhilarating.

468
00:41:04,836 --> 00:41:06,705
Let's hope so.

469
00:41:08,378 --> 00:41:12,508
Well, I think I've made a silly fool
of myself this morning.

470
00:41:12,508 --> 00:41:14,242
- No, no, not at all.
- No, no, I did.

471
00:41:14,242 --> 00:41:19,049
I was just sticking my nose into a lot
of stuff that's none of my business..

472
00:41:19,049 --> 00:41:22,249
and coming up with some crazy ideas.
You were right.

473
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,294
I guess I was imagining
a lot of things last night.

474
00:41:27,463 --> 00:41:28,953
Probably the champagne.

475
00:41:32,668 --> 00:41:35,694
- Well
- Let me clean your jacket..

476
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:38,467
Oh, that's all right.
I have another one.

477
00:41:38,467 --> 00:41:41,942
We get to Chicago tomorrow and
I did come on this trip to do some work.

478
00:41:41,942 --> 00:41:43,706
So I'll say good-bye.

479
00:41:43,706 --> 00:41:47,306
- Couldn't you possibly join us for dinner?
- Oh, yes, do.

480
00:41:48,584 --> 00:41:51,143
Thanks. No.
I think I'll just eat in my room.

481
00:41:58,526 --> 00:42:01,393
This latch...
seems to be stuck.

482
00:42:03,298 --> 00:42:05,823
I'll get the porter
to fix it right away.

483
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,894
What are you up to there, lover boy?

484
00:42:39,894 --> 00:42:41,958
Hello, Bob Sweet.

485
00:42:42,636 --> 00:42:44,627
- Hello, Bobby.
- How are ya?

486
00:42:46,006 --> 00:42:47,234
I'm all right.

487
00:42:47,234 --> 00:42:51,209
Better yet, uh, what are you?
A miniature alcoholic?

488
00:42:51,209 --> 00:42:54,509
Did you know that
the Blanard Tunnel...

489
00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:57,049
was the highest point on this line?

490
00:42:57,049 --> 00:42:58,413
Yeah, I knew that.

491
00:42:58,413 --> 00:43:01,647
Did you know that when we reach it,
I intend to be higher?

492
00:43:02,521 --> 00:43:05,319
- Just don't fall off, huh? Okay?
- Oh, no.

493
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:08,986
I've left this train once already.
That's enough.

494
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:11,689
You have? What do you mean?

495
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:14,062
Last night...

496
00:43:14,062 --> 00:43:16,727
just as I was about to...

497
00:43:17,837 --> 00:43:20,499
kiss my beautiful blonde...

498
00:43:20,499 --> 00:43:23,838
I saw her boss
hanging outside the window.

499
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:26,173
Wait. You saw her boss,
Professor Schreiner, huh?

500
00:43:26,173 --> 00:43:27,974
That's him.

501
00:43:27,974 --> 00:43:29,947
That's the fellow.

502
00:43:29,947 --> 00:43:32,041
He was shot in the head.

503
00:43:33,685 --> 00:43:36,176
I knew that
I had been drinking...

504
00:43:36,176 --> 00:43:38,916
so I went to see
the professor this morning...

505
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:41,754
and I found this
little weasel of a guy in his room.

506
00:43:41,754 --> 00:43:44,158
- Edgar Whiney.
- That's him.

507
00:43:44,158 --> 00:43:47,687
- How did you know that?
- Oh, I-I know. I just know.

508
00:43:47,687 --> 00:43:49,757
Go on, go on.

509
00:43:49,757 --> 00:43:52,564
Well, then this huge mountain...

510
00:43:52,564 --> 00:43:55,367
with a gold mine stuck in his gums...

511
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:59,501
picked me up and
threw me off the train.

512
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:03,013
- What... But you never saw the professor, huh?
- No, I saw him.

513
00:44:03,013 --> 00:44:05,379
- I saw him this afternoon.
- Where?

514
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:07,384
In Hilly's compartment.

515
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:11,285
See, the man I saw last night
was a hallucination.

516
00:44:12,222 --> 00:44:14,713
- What did he look like?
- Who?

517
00:44:14,713 --> 00:44:17,226
The professor, you know,
that you saw this afternoon.

518
00:44:17,226 --> 00:44:19,387
Like his picture.

519
00:44:19,387 --> 00:44:24,127
- Did he say anything to you?
- Why are you asking me all these questions?

520
00:44:24,127 --> 00:44:26,692
- Did he say anything...
- Nothing, nothing.

521
00:44:26,692 --> 00:44:28,897
He was tired
and wanted to have a scotch.

522
00:44:29,807 --> 00:44:33,174
You don't have any ice in your drink.
- That's it! Scotch!

523
00:44:34,244 --> 00:44:37,236
Listen. See, you didn't have
a hallucination.

524
00:44:38,248 --> 00:44:40,216
The professor's been murdered.

525
00:44:40,216 --> 00:44:43,081
The guy you saw this afternoon
was a fake.

526
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:44,881
Oh, no.

527
00:44:44,881 --> 00:44:49,084
Yeah. Listen, I talked to the real
professor last night. I mean it.

528
00:44:49,084 --> 00:44:51,854
He didn't wanna have anything
to do with Mr. Devereau.

529
00:44:51,854 --> 00:44:54,658
Besides that, he's a health nut.
Doesn't touch alcohol.

530
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:58,360
Oh, Bobby, just because
you're a vitamin salesman?

531
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,096
My name is Stevens.
I'm a federal agent.

532
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,073
We've been working on this case
for two and a half years.

533
00:45:08,044 --> 00:45:10,137
Well, what are you tailing
the professor for?

534
00:45:10,137 --> 00:45:13,273
I am not tailing the professor,
I'm tailing Devereau.

535
00:45:13,273 --> 00:45:14,611
Come on. Let's go.

536
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:17,174
Wait a minute. What about Hilly?

537
00:45:17,174 --> 00:45:20,153
Don't worry about it. They're not
gonna kill her till we get to Chicago.

538
00:45:20,153 --> 00:45:22,918
I don't even think they'll try
to kill you till then. Come on.

539
00:45:25,527 --> 00:45:28,121
Devereau's men must've brought the
professor back here...

540
00:45:28,121 --> 00:45:30,027
after 9:00 pm last night.

541
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:33,829
- How do you figure that?
- Because I left him at 9:00 pm.

542
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:38,362
And because this is the easiest access
to the roof. Somehow, he must've escaped.

543
00:45:38,362 --> 00:45:41,967
He got out to this ladder, then ran back
down the train before they shot him.

544
00:45:45,647 --> 00:45:48,343
You're not going up there, are you?

545
00:45:48,343 --> 00:45:51,976
Yeah. The Blanard Tunnel is up ahead.

546
00:45:51,976 --> 00:45:54,714
Come on up and
keep a lookout, will ya?

547
00:45:54,714 --> 00:45:56,848
All right, I'll try.

548
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:39,088
What did you find?

549
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,098
It was hooked on
a protruding bolt.

550
00:46:44,102 --> 00:46:47,333
Then I was right.
I did see him.

551
00:46:59,785 --> 00:47:05,017
I'll bet Devereau has already got the body
picked up and placed in cold storage someplace.

552
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,888
Too bad.
He was a sweet old guy.

553
00:47:08,888 --> 00:47:11,689
Buy why did he have
to kill the professor?

554
00:47:11,689 --> 00:47:15,630
He was going to be embarrassed
by the findings in the professor's book.

555
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:19,060
Two of the institute's Rembrandts...

556
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:22,003
both bought and authenticated
by Devereau...

557
00:47:22,003 --> 00:47:24,166
were going to be proved forgeries.

558
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,439
The professor had the proof
in his possession.

559
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:31,879
I asked him last night,
"What was the proof?"

560
00:47:32,817 --> 00:47:36,718
He told me I was going
to have to wait for his lecture.

561
00:47:36,718 --> 00:47:38,777
And Devereau wasn't going to wait.

562
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:44,560
I think the idea
was to kidnap the professor...

563
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,618
then kill him...

564
00:47:46,618 --> 00:47:50,063
and then substitute
some phony look-alike...

565
00:47:50,063 --> 00:47:52,863
who would botch the lecture
and discredit the book.

566
00:47:54,337 --> 00:47:57,795
- We've gotta find the proof.
- But they have the proof.

567
00:47:57,795 --> 00:48:00,707
They have it. That's what Whiney
and everyone was looking for this morning...

568
00:48:00,707 --> 00:48:02,244
the Rembrandt letters.

569
00:48:02,244 --> 00:48:05,873
They said that they found them
in the professor's trunk.

570
00:48:05,873 --> 00:48:08,918
They're lying. That's the first place
they would've looked...

571
00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:12,385
before they started turning
his room upside down.

572
00:48:13,722 --> 00:48:16,782
No! No, the professor hid them
someplace, somewhere simple...

573
00:48:16,782 --> 00:48:20,056
as a precaution when he found out
Devereau was on the train.

574
00:48:20,056 --> 00:48:22,689
My God! I know where they are!
Come on! Come on!

575
00:48:46,788 --> 00:48:48,779
The Rembrandt letters.

576
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:53,720
Holy Toledo!
I think you've found it.

577
00:48:55,763 --> 00:48:58,823
This is the genuine article,
penned by the old boy himself, huh?

578
00:48:58,823 --> 00:49:02,495
"Rembrandt Harmenszoon Van Rijn. "

579
00:49:03,971 --> 00:49:06,963
Yeah. My guess is there's a fact there's
some kind of a date in all this...

580
00:49:06,963 --> 00:49:09,771
that proves the charges the professor
makes in his book.

581
00:49:09,771 --> 00:49:13,280
Push the button for the porter, will ya?
I wanna get the conductor to radio ahead
to the next town.

582
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:18,307
You know, it's difficult to believe
that a man was killed over those.

583
00:49:18,307 --> 00:49:21,218
This is the tip of an iceberg.

584
00:49:21,218 --> 00:49:23,779
You know that plane crash
in Cologne, Germany last year?

585
00:49:23,779 --> 00:49:27,793
That was a Devereau special.
A hundred people got killed in that one.

586
00:49:27,793 --> 00:49:31,695
It was just to cover up his involvement
in the Metropolitan Gallery scandal.

587
00:49:31,695 --> 00:49:34,427
We knew he was responsible.
We couldn't pin it on him.

588
00:49:35,235 --> 00:49:40,468
These letters are gonna blow his
multimillion-dollar operation in art sky-high.

589
00:49:40,468 --> 00:49:44,601
That's why she was so distant.
They must've had her in a corner.

590
00:49:45,412 --> 00:49:47,676
I want you to remember
that your neck is on the line too.

591
00:49:47,676 --> 00:49:49,908
You already told him you saw
the real professor shot.

592
00:49:49,908 --> 00:49:54,010
Yeah, I did.
So what do I do now?

593
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:56,987
You be responsible for Hilly.
Get her off the train and to safety.

594
00:49:56,987 --> 00:49:59,081
- I'm gonna take care of Mr. Devereau.
- Here comes the tunnel.

595
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:02,059
We'll make our move when the
train gets to Dodge City tonight.

596
00:50:03,162 --> 00:50:06,154
That's appropriate, huh?
Gun smoke at the O.K. Corral.

597
00:50:13,272 --> 00:50:14,933
What happened?

598
00:50:16,842 --> 00:50:18,707
Bob, what happened?

599
00:50:20,012 --> 00:50:22,071
Put-Put 'em back.

600
00:50:22,071 --> 00:50:25,776
Go on, now. Do it.
Get my gun. Take my gun.

601
00:50:25,776 --> 00:50:29,286
Take my gun. Go on.
Get the girl off the train, okay?

602
00:50:30,288 --> 00:50:31,949
Go on.!

603
00:50:33,858 --> 00:50:36,986
You know, I got a funny feeling
this bullet was meant for you.

604
00:50:42,901 --> 00:50:45,131
Shoot.! That man's dead.!

605
00:50:47,071 --> 00:50:50,438
- Holy moly, you shot him!
- I didn't... No.

606
00:50:51,175 --> 00:50:54,374
- No! Wait a minute!
- He's been shot!

607
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,345
A man's been shot!

608
00:50:58,116 --> 00:51:00,107
I didn't shoot him!

609
00:51:03,854 --> 00:51:05,515
Hey. Hey, you're not...

610
00:51:05,515 --> 00:51:08,683
Hey! He's not dead!

611
00:53:56,722 --> 00:53:58,951
Hold it!
Don't move, or I'll shoot!

612
00:54:38,095 --> 00:54:40,086
Son of a bitch!

613
00:55:23,606 --> 00:55:26,473
Wait! Wait!

614
00:55:31,748 --> 00:55:33,340
Wait!

615
00:55:36,686 --> 00:55:40,213
Wait! Hello!

616
00:55:44,126 --> 00:55:47,584
Hello! Hello, please!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

617
00:55:47,584 --> 00:55:50,757
Wait a...
Come on, please! Stop!

618
00:56:03,512 --> 00:56:05,173
Thanks a lot, Eddie.

619
00:56:07,616 --> 00:56:11,245


620
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:19,426
That's it, boys.!

621
00:56:19,426 --> 00:56:22,088
Blow those babies'heads off!

622
00:56:29,137 --> 00:56:31,071
Excuse me.

623
00:56:31,071 --> 00:56:32,800
Just a minute.

624
00:56:32,905 --> 00:56:35,006
Geez, would you look at that!

625
00:56:38,613 --> 00:56:41,208
That boy is somethin', ain't he?

626
00:56:48,723 --> 00:56:50,247
Commercial.

627
00:56:54,695 --> 00:56:58,187
- Now, what can I do for you?
- I want to report a murder.

628
00:56:58,187 --> 00:57:01,098
A murder. A man's been shot
on the Silver Streak...

629
00:57:01,098 --> 00:57:04,865
and there's a girl who's in great danger.
We have to stop the train.

630
00:57:04,865 --> 00:57:07,270
Now, wait a second.
You say a man's been shot?

631
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:10,439
- Yes.
- Jumpin'Jiminy!

632
00:57:10,439 --> 00:57:12,706
We've never had a murder before.

633
00:57:12,706 --> 00:57:15,578
Sit down.
Have a cup of coffee. Help yourself.

634
00:57:15,578 --> 00:57:18,311
Now, uh, let's get the facts.

635
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:24,914
- What did you say your name was?
- Caldwell. George Caldwell.

636
00:57:24,914 --> 00:57:27,619
I'm from Los Angeles.

637
00:57:27,619 --> 00:57:31,789
L.A. Okay.
Who was shot?

638
00:57:31,789 --> 00:57:33,923
- Actually, there were two.
- Two?

639
00:57:33,923 --> 00:57:36,525
Yes. The first was Bob Sweet.

640
00:57:36,525 --> 00:57:38,661
He was a federal undercover agent.

641
00:57:38,661 --> 00:57:40,228
- A fed? No shit?
- Yes.

642
00:57:40,228 --> 00:57:43,537
And the second was a man
by the name of Reace. I shot him.

643
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,706
- You shot him?
- Yes. He shot Sweet.

644
00:57:47,706 --> 00:57:50,180
- Because Sweet was a fed?
- No, because he thought Sweet was me.

645
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:53,275
- Reace shot Sweet, and you shot Reace?
- Right.

646
00:57:53,275 --> 00:57:56,719
- With a spear gun.
- W-With a what?

647
00:57:56,719 --> 00:57:59,656
You see, I took Sweet's gun,
but I dropped it...

648
00:57:59,656 --> 00:58:01,749
so I had to use a spear gun.

649
00:58:03,261 --> 00:58:05,525
Uh, don't you...
can't we call someone?

650
00:58:05,525 --> 00:58:07,497
Wait a second.
You say you shot Reace with a spear?

651
00:58:07,497 --> 00:58:10,898
Yes. He was going to shoot me.
- With a spear?

652
00:58:10,898 --> 00:58:13,335
No, with a bullet!
He shot the professor.

653
00:58:13,335 --> 00:58:15,498
- Who shot the professor?
- Reace.

654
00:58:15,498 --> 00:58:17,734
- Reace shot Sweet!
- And the professor.

655
00:58:19,344 --> 00:58:21,073
Makes three.

656
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:26,840
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.
The professor was shot last night.

657
00:58:28,953 --> 00:58:31,945
- Uh, can't wejust do all of this later?
- Was there anyone else?

658
00:58:31,945 --> 00:58:34,355
- Anyone else what?
- Shot!

659
00:58:34,355 --> 00:58:38,521
No. No, but there will be soon
if we don't stop the train.

660
00:58:38,521 --> 00:58:42,861
Please, just pick up the phone
and call your superiors.

661
00:58:42,861 --> 00:58:45,458
Tell them I have
the Rembrandt letters.

662
00:58:45,458 --> 00:58:48,801
- That's why the professor was shot.
- Was he with the feds?

663
00:58:48,801 --> 00:58:51,932
- Who?
- This guy Rembrandt.

664
00:58:53,811 --> 00:58:57,645
- Rembrandt is dead.
- Dead? That makes four.

665
00:58:58,549 --> 00:59:01,814
Listen, feller, you sure you're not
makin'this up as you go along?

666
00:59:01,814 --> 00:59:05,286
I'm an officer of the law and I got better
things to do than listen to that funnin'.

667
00:59:07,491 --> 00:59:09,424
That's my hot line.

668
00:59:09,424 --> 00:59:11,551
Now, you take the time to get your facts straight.
When I come back,

669
00:59:11,551 --> 00:59:15,324
I want your answers clear and to the point.
Got that?

670
00:59:15,324 --> 00:59:17,662
And you can start
with who shot Rembrandt.

671
00:59:19,702 --> 00:59:21,795
Hello. Yeah.

672
00:59:22,872 --> 00:59:24,863
This is Chauncey.

673
00:59:26,642 --> 00:59:28,303
No shit!

674
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:33,480
Jumpin'Jiminy! He's sittin'
right here in my office.

675
00:59:34,884 --> 00:59:36,010
That's right.

676
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:40,317
Came in here spoutin'some bull about shootin'
some people on the train, wanted to confess.

677
00:59:40,317 --> 00:59:43,290
I knew he was a loony right off.

678
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:46,020
Oh, yeah. Don't you worry.

679
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:49,655
I've handled loonies before.
Gotcha.

680
01:00:09,217 --> 01:00:12,050
Sheriff, I'm sorry.
I guess I was a little rattled before.

681
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:16,489
- It must've sounded crazy to you.
- Oh, that's perfectly all right, Mr. Caldwell.

682
01:00:16,489 --> 01:00:19,287
That is what you said your name was,
didn't you? George Caldwell?

683
01:00:19,287 --> 01:00:20,987
Yeah.

684
01:00:20,987 --> 01:00:23,427
I really think that we oughta
get on the phone to Washington.

685
01:00:23,427 --> 01:00:27,058
If they heard what I have to say,
they would stop the train.

686
01:00:27,058 --> 01:00:29,762
Oh, yeah. Them boys in Washington,
they're pretty smart.

687
01:00:29,762 --> 01:00:32,101
You ever watch 'em on TV? Bam, bam.

688
01:00:32,101 --> 01:00:35,836
Sheriff, listen to me! They know
all about Sweet and Devereau.

689
01:00:35,836 --> 01:00:39,038
I figured that the Silver Streak
should be in Kansas in an hour.

690
01:00:39,038 --> 01:00:41,513
We could stop the train
at Scott City or maybe Dodge.

691
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:46,246
All right, mister! Keep your hands where
they are, and we'll have no trouble!

692
01:00:47,321 --> 01:00:48,811
- Give me that!
- Don't shoot.

693
01:00:49,456 --> 01:00:51,253
"Don't shoot"?

694
01:00:51,253 --> 01:00:55,226
You stupid, ignorant,
son-of-a-bitch, dumb bastard!

695
01:00:55,226 --> 01:00:59,129
Jesus Christ! I've met some dumb bastards
in my time, but you outdo them all!

696
01:00:59,129 --> 01:01:01,895
Get over there! What the hell
do you think I'm doing?

697
01:01:01,895 --> 01:01:04,266
I come here to help a girl
who may be killed at any minute...

698
01:01:04,266 --> 01:01:06,669
and you're playing cops and robbers!

699
01:01:06,669 --> 01:01:09,105
There ain't no way
you're gonna get away with this!

700
01:01:09,105 --> 01:01:12,042
Get a... Pick up the phone!

701
01:01:12,845 --> 01:01:14,403
Pick it up!

702
01:01:15,648 --> 01:01:17,673
- We know who you are.
- What are you talking about?

703
01:01:17,673 --> 01:01:20,719
That was the county sheriff.
They're comin' to get you. You ain't got a chance.

704
01:01:21,588 --> 01:01:25,024
- Get me for what?
- For killin' a vitamin salesman on the Silver Streak.

705
01:01:25,024 --> 01:01:29,618
He was no vitamin salesman. He was
a federal agent. They should know that.

706
01:01:29,618 --> 01:01:33,096
If you'll just put down
that gun and come along quietly.

707
01:01:33,096 --> 01:01:36,726
You're outnumbered.
Ain't no way you're gonna escape.

708
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:38,429
What is that?

709
01:01:40,372 --> 01:01:42,203
That's my deputy.

710
01:01:43,141 --> 01:01:44,836
- Get outside.
- All right.

711
01:01:44,836 --> 01:01:47,174
- Get outside!
- Don't shoot.

712
01:01:47,174 --> 01:01:48,611
- Don't shoot.

713
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:55,247
- Don't shoot.
- Keep your hands down. Keep your hands down.

714
01:01:55,247 --> 01:01:57,686
- Uncle Oliver, look what I got!

715
01:01:57,686 --> 01:02:00,054
- Keep your hands down.
- Uncle Oliver, he's got your gun.

716
01:02:00,054 --> 01:02:03,287
Get your hands up! Get against
the wall. Keep your hands up.

717
01:02:03,728 --> 01:02:06,629
- The whole county knows about you!
- Get back!

718
01:02:06,629 --> 01:02:09,461
- Keep those hands up.
- They ain't gonna rest till they hunt you down.!

719
01:02:09,461 --> 01:02:12,434
Keep your hands up. Keep 'em up.

720
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:16,834
Uncle Oliver, he's takin' your car!

721
01:02:16,834 --> 01:02:19,740
You ain't ever gonna get away with this!

722
01:02:21,545 --> 01:02:24,343
- Uncle Oliver! Uncle Oliver, he's got your car.
- Moose!

723
01:02:24,343 --> 01:02:27,441
One more word outta you,
I'm gonna smash your mouth!

724
01:02:35,059 --> 01:02:36,583
J.J.! J.J.!

725
01:02:38,428 --> 01:02:40,862
I got... I got bad news for ya.

726
01:02:40,862 --> 01:02:42,921
Caldwell's escaped.

727
01:02:44,334 --> 01:02:47,167
Yeah, look, let's not go into that now.

728
01:02:47,167 --> 01:02:49,102
He's headed down 350...

729
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:51,732
and we can stop him
before he crosses the state line.

730
01:02:52,842 --> 01:02:54,002
Right.

731
01:03:01,451 --> 01:03:03,851
Dumb, stupid bastard.

732
01:03:06,589 --> 01:03:08,079
Shit!

733
01:03:10,327 --> 01:03:12,817
- Who are you?
- I'm a thief, man.

734
01:03:12,817 --> 01:03:14,829
Take it easy. I ain't
gonna freak you out no more.

735
01:03:14,829 --> 01:03:17,263
How about handin' me them keys.
I'd like to get these cuffs off.

736
01:03:17,263 --> 01:03:18,925
Sorry.

737
01:03:20,336 --> 01:03:24,204
That's real nice the way you handled
yourself back there with old Oliver. I was listenin'

738
01:03:24,204 --> 01:03:26,707
- What they want you for anyway, man?
- Murder.

739
01:03:27,609 --> 01:03:30,510
Drop me off anywhere along in here, okay?
I don't mess with the big "M."

740
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:34,515
I'm not stopping anywhere.
Do you know the roads around here?

741
01:03:34,515 --> 01:03:38,417
Maybe we could make a deal. I'm not
a murderer. I'm trying to prevent one.

742
01:03:38,417 --> 01:03:41,047
But in about a minute, we're
gonna be surrounded by cops.

743
01:03:41,047 --> 01:03:43,853
If you can get us out of it,
you'd be doing both of us a favor.

744
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:45,951
What do you think?

745
01:03:45,951 --> 01:03:48,291
I think you better make a right
up here and then a sharp left.

746
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:49,955
I'm comin' over.

747
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:59,973
Jesus Christ, man! That's how you murdered your
victims? Put 'em in a car and bounced 'em to death?

748
01:03:59,973 --> 01:04:03,101
- Sorry.
- Sorry, my ass!

749
01:04:03,101 --> 01:04:05,008
You're dangerous.

750
01:04:07,482 --> 01:04:11,145
Proves one thing, though.
You don't do this for no livin'..

751
01:04:12,086 --> 01:04:15,544
- No, I don't.
- All right. Just take it easy.

752
01:04:15,544 --> 01:04:18,091
I'm gonna take over in a minute..

753
01:04:18,091 --> 01:04:20,150
Don't make no more
sudden moves, okay?

754
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:22,525
I'm gonna check with headquarters
and find out the game plan for tonight.

755
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,291
He said he was gonna
get back on that train.

756
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:28,027
He has to cross into Kansas
on 120 or...

757
01:04:28,027 --> 01:04:30,797
on 116 or 350.

758
01:04:30,797 --> 01:04:35,205
Now, I figure if we put stakeouts on
all of those roads, we'll get that feller.

759
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:40,110
The first should be at the junction
of Taubman's Road, on 116.

760
01:04:43,316 --> 01:04:46,251
- What are you slowing down for?
- There's a truck up ahead.

761
01:04:46,251 --> 01:04:48,150
So there's a truck up ahead.

762
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,815
We the man.!
Let's turn on the siren...

763
01:04:50,815 --> 01:04:54,850
get them hippies off the road!
Put some foot into it.! Move it.!

764
01:04:57,863 --> 01:04:59,524
Oh, God!

765
01:05:14,013 --> 01:05:16,641
Would you like to drive for a while?

766
01:05:16,641 --> 01:05:20,651
Car 36 report your position.
Do you read me?

767
01:05:20,651 --> 01:05:22,778
Car 36. Chauncey,...

768
01:05:22,778 --> 01:05:26,848
we're moving in for the roadblock
at the intersection of Taubman's Road and 116.

769
01:05:26,848 --> 01:05:29,451
That's fine, fellas.
Car 45 is already there.

770
01:05:29,451 --> 01:05:32,121
We're going in
for a double block on all points.

771
01:05:32,121 --> 01:05:34,722
The old double roadblock, huh?

772
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:37,791
That's all I wanted to know, Oliver.
Fasten yourself in, partner.

773
01:05:39,471 --> 01:05:44,101
You ain't got nothin' to worry about.
I got the nerve and I got the touch.

774
01:05:46,377 --> 01:05:50,677
Better pull it tighter. Real tight.
I used to do this all the time back home in Texas.

775
01:05:50,677 --> 01:05:53,512
- Do what?
- Demolition derby.

776
01:05:54,586 --> 01:05:56,713
I hear somethin' comin',
but I can't see anything yet.

777
01:05:56,713 --> 01:05:59,222
That's fine, boys.
We got 'em boxed in now.

778
01:06:00,391 --> 01:06:02,018
- Aren't you gonna slow down?
- Slow down?

779
01:06:02,018 --> 01:06:04,857
Open your eyes, man, 'cause
I'm gonna make a criminal out of you yet.

780
01:06:05,896 --> 01:06:08,387
Goddamn it!
Fellas, watch out!

781
01:06:25,415 --> 01:06:27,815
Hello, car 36!
What the hell happened to you guys?

782
01:06:27,815 --> 01:06:33,016
Hey, Chauncey! This is Grover T. Muldoon!
You wanna know what happened?

783
01:06:33,016 --> 01:06:36,491
We just whooped your ass!
We whooped your ass!

784
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:46,001


785
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:05,215
"I don't know. I met him last night."
I've never seen him before.

786
01:07:05,215 --> 01:07:08,155
That's what you told us this morning,
and I'm finding it...

787
01:07:08,155 --> 01:07:10,624
increasingly hard to believe.

788
01:07:10,624 --> 01:07:13,355
- Well, it's the truth.
- Is it?

789
01:07:13,355 --> 01:07:16,795
No matter, when the time comes,
we'll take care of Mr. Caldwell.

790
01:07:16,795 --> 01:07:19,732
Meanwhile, we're going to take...

791
01:07:19,732 --> 01:07:22,326
extremely good care of you.

792
01:07:49,964 --> 01:07:52,956
- What are you doing?
- I'm following the plan. Just changed my mind.

793
01:07:52,956 --> 01:07:56,400
Are you crazy? I thought
we were gonna take the Chevy in back.

794
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,633
Chevy? That's a jerk-off, man!
This here is pure pussy.

795
01:07:59,633 --> 01:08:03,074
Pure pussy?
I'll tell that to the judge.

796
01:08:03,074 --> 01:08:06,340
Don't worry about no judge. This here's
gonna get us to Kansas City on time.

797
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:09,405
Well, how about jail? Did you know
the office was right in front of us?

798
01:08:09,405 --> 01:08:12,350
Go check the guard, okay?
This ain't gonna take but a second.

799
01:08:36,242 --> 01:08:38,233
Hold it right there, nigger.

800
01:08:40,446 --> 01:08:43,142
Hey! How you doin', old dude?
What's happenin'?

801
01:08:43,142 --> 01:08:44,979
Step away from the car.

802
01:08:44,979 --> 01:08:48,509
was listenin' to the engine. Sounds real good, man.
- Does it come with whitewalls?

803
01:08:48,509 --> 01:08:49,953
Just move.

804
01:08:49,953 --> 01:08:52,958
Okay, I'm gonna move now.
You just take it easy.

805
01:08:52,958 --> 01:08:55,221
I said move!

806
01:08:58,731 --> 01:09:01,893
A pussy, huh?
A pussy!

807
01:09:02,501 --> 01:09:04,469
Can we go now?

808
01:09:06,204 --> 01:09:08,434
I thought you was an amateur.

809
01:09:08,434 --> 01:09:10,668
You're a real pro.

810
01:09:13,245 --> 01:09:15,236
A real pro.

811
01:09:23,655 --> 01:09:26,419
Man, that was beautiful.
Ain't nobody gonna mess with you.

812
01:09:26,419 --> 01:09:30,791
- Oh, yeah.
- I mean it. You're a pretty bad old dude.

813
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:32,989
All I wanna do is get to Kansas City
by the morning.

814
01:09:32,989 --> 01:09:37,091
Don't worry about that. With this honey,
we're gonna be in Kansas City.

815
01:09:37,091 --> 01:09:39,504
You just get some sleep,
'cause we're on our way to Kansas City!

816
01:11:03,085 --> 01:11:04,882
You thinking about her?

817
01:11:05,721 --> 01:11:07,052
Yeah.

818
01:11:09,191 --> 01:11:11,921
Crazy thing is I just met her
two nights ago.

819
01:11:13,028 --> 01:11:15,428
That's the way love is.

820
01:11:15,428 --> 01:11:17,624
I always lose my memory
when I fall in love.

821
01:11:20,501 --> 01:11:25,131
Like you said, you know,
we just get on the train, get her off...

822
01:11:25,131 --> 01:11:28,539
tell the police,
let them handle the rest of that stuff.

823
01:11:31,713 --> 01:11:33,647
Yeah.
Yeah, but what?

824
01:11:36,718 --> 01:11:39,516
I only hope she's still alive.

825
01:11:46,961 --> 01:11:48,861
Arriving passenger Hall...

826
01:11:48,861 --> 01:11:53,525
please report to the information desk
in the north concourse.

827
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:57,798
Great! We've got 10 minutes!
I'll get the tickets. Just wait right here!

828
01:11:59,606 --> 01:12:03,269
- You go get the tickets, and it's good-bye, George.
- What are you talking about? That!

829
01:12:04,544 --> 01:12:07,411


830
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:11,315
That's my driver's license picture.
I hate that picture.

831
01:12:11,315 --> 01:12:14,183
Yeah? Why don't you just shuffle
right over there and tell them about it.

832
01:12:17,758 --> 01:12:19,885
- Are they the police?
- No, they're from Travelers Aid.

833
01:12:19,885 --> 01:12:22,428
- How are we gonna get on the train?
- That's a good question.

834
01:12:22,428 --> 01:12:26,398
- I've still got the gun. I could start a diversion.
- Yeah, blow your brains out.

835
01:12:26,398 --> 01:12:28,831
Wait. I got an idea.

836
01:12:28,831 --> 01:12:30,664
You come with me

837
01:12:42,581 --> 01:12:45,277
- How much you want for that radio?
- Thirty dollars.

838
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:48,115
- We'll take it. Pay the man.
- What? Pay the man.

839
01:12:48,115 --> 01:12:50,678
- That's a bad hat you got on.  I'll give you five dollars for it.
- It's yours.

840
01:12:50,678 --> 01:12:53,350
- Thank you. Pay the man.
- What? Pay the man!

841
01:12:56,062 --> 01:12:57,757
And another five
for the shoe polish.

842
01:12:57,757 --> 01:13:00,355
- What do we want with shoe polish?
- Don't argue. Pay the man.

843
01:13:01,866 --> 01:13:05,131
- One, two, three, four. Forty dollars.
- Thank you very much.

844
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:08,366
- Thank you.
- See anything else you want, just make me an offer.

845
01:13:08,366 --> 01:13:10,738
- No, thank you.
- Uh, how about a brush?

846
01:13:12,744 --> 01:13:14,075
- Nothing!

847
01:13:15,213 --> 01:13:16,612
Can't win 'em all.

848
01:13:16,612 --> 01:13:20,708
That is the stupidest idea
I have ever heard.

849
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:22,685
You wanna save that girl's life?

850
01:13:22,685 --> 01:13:25,917
Then it's this or we're dead.
Now take off your jacket.

851
01:13:25,917 --> 01:13:27,651
Come on!

852
01:13:29,094 --> 01:13:31,790
- I can't pass for black!
- Who're you tellin'?

853
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:34,730
I didn't say I was gonna make you black.,
I said I was gonna get you on the train.

854
01:13:34,730 --> 01:13:37,130
We got to make them cops
think you're black.

855
01:13:38,569 --> 01:13:42,130
- It'll never work. Never.
- What, are you afraid it won't come off?

856
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:44,436
That's a good joke.
That's humorous.

857
01:13:44,436 --> 01:13:46,669
Like that, huh?
May I speak?

858
01:13:46,669 --> 01:13:50,305
This is crazy! It'll never work!
Don't you understand?

859
01:13:50,305 --> 01:13:53,144
Are you kiddin'? Look at that.

860
01:13:53,144 --> 01:13:55,412
AI Jolson made a million bucks
lookin' like that.

861
01:13:55,412 --> 01:13:57,249
Now here, you try.

862
01:13:59,022 --> 01:14:01,422
Don't worry about your eyes,
'cause you're gonna be wearin' these.

863
01:14:02,593 --> 01:14:04,356
There you go.

864
01:14:06,063 --> 01:14:08,361
That looks good.
Get on top of your head.

865
01:14:10,067 --> 01:14:11,727
Put on my jacket.

866
01:14:15,605 --> 01:14:17,903
Then we'll slap this beanie
on your head. There you go.

867
01:14:17,903 --> 01:14:19,771
All right, ace or deuce?

868
01:14:19,771 --> 01:14:23,107
That's bad, man! You're lookin' good!
Now here, take this radio.

869
01:14:23,107 --> 01:14:25,909
When you step
out of here, step out like King Shit.

870
01:14:25,909 --> 01:14:26,880
You bad!

871
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,281
Put that radio to your ear.
That's gonna help cover your face.

872
01:14:29,281 --> 01:14:31,320
Just move with the rhythm of the music.

873
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,788
Move your body with the rhythm of the music.
That's all you gotta remember, okay?
Let me see you try it.

874
01:14:34,788 --> 01:14:38,759
Step to the music.
Step to the music. Yeah.

875
01:14:38,759 --> 01:14:41,956
Step to the music... Stop.

876
01:14:41,956 --> 01:14:46,160
How come you whiteys got such a tight ass, man?
How are you gonna walk outta here
with a tan face and that white walk?

877
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:49,670
Just get into the music.
Come on, George. Loosen up.

878
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:52,172
Listen to the beat.
Let your feet move.

879
01:14:52,172 --> 01:14:54,674
Now, do it! Can't you feel it?
The tempo's right here.

880
01:14:54,674 --> 01:14:57,234
Right in there. That's all you gotta do.

881
01:14:57,234 --> 01:14:59,678
Yeah, now try it!
Don't you feel it?

882
01:14:59,678 --> 01:15:04,082
Yeah. Needs work, George.
Needs a lot of work. You know that?

883
01:15:04,082 --> 01:15:08,680
Will you practice? Man, you gotta practice,
but let it be loose! Listen to the music.
Follow the beat. Hear?

884
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:11,817
- Feel it comin' up? Feel it?
- I got it.

885
01:15:11,817 --> 01:15:15,329
It's comin'?
Yeah, that's it.

886
01:15:15,329 --> 01:15:19,163
I'm gonna get the tickets. Okay? I'll be back.
Work on it.

887
01:15:19,163 --> 01:15:20,791
God, honkies!

888
01:15:33,214 --> 01:15:36,479
Come on, man, get some jive goin'.
Be cool.

889
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:39,280
Shake it, but don't break it. That's it.

890
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,287
Hey, man, how do I look?

891
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:43,191
You look sharp, mister.
I feel sharp!

892
01:15:43,191 --> 01:15:45,622
You hear? I feel like
the sun around midnight.

893
01:15:45,622 --> 01:15:49,094
You dig? Outta sight!
Get down! Get down!

894
01:15:49,094 --> 01:15:53,190
Feelin' good! Feelin' fine!
Feelin' real fine!

895
01:15:53,190 --> 01:15:56,292
That's it. Just loosen up
those hips, sugar.

896
01:15:56,292 --> 01:15:58,394
All you whiteys got a tight ass.
Yeah, get that ass movin'.

897
01:15:58,394 --> 01:16:01,133
Outta sight! I'm a macaroni!
Get down! I'm the king!

898
01:16:01,133 --> 01:16:03,574
Number one, baby.!

899
01:16:10,984 --> 01:16:14,784
- Um, um, I'm not....
- Hey, you must be in pretty big trouble, fella.

900
01:16:14,784 --> 01:16:18,085
But for God's sake, learn to keep time.

901
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:37,172
Shit, that's my man!
That's my man!

902
01:16:39,578 --> 01:16:42,240
- I don't think we'll make it past the cops.
- We'll make it past the cops.

903
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:44,282
I just hope we don't see no Muslims.

904
01:16:56,228 --> 01:16:58,059
- Who you lookin' for?
- White guy.

905
01:16:58,059 --> 01:17:00,121
Well, if I see any,
I'll let you know.

906
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:03,000
Your attention, please.

907
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,864
The AMRoad train,
the Silver Streak...

908
01:17:04,864 --> 01:17:08,895
departing for Chicago is now loading
on track three.

909
01:17:08,895 --> 01:17:12,033
- This the Chicago train?
- First class. Yes, sir.

910
01:17:12,033 --> 01:17:15,170
There will be no visitors
permitted beyond the gates.

911
01:17:24,088 --> 01:17:26,818
Board!

912
01:17:39,070 --> 01:17:41,196
- She's gone.
- Sure that's her compartment?

913
01:17:41,196 --> 01:17:44,968
Yes, of course.
Hey, wait a minute.

914
01:17:44,968 --> 01:17:46,771
Where are my clothes?
All my clothes are gone

915
01:17:46,771 --> 01:17:50,074
- You sure this is your compartment?
- Of course I'm sure.

916
01:17:50,074 --> 01:17:53,344
The police must have taken everything
when they found Sweet's body.

917
01:17:53,344 --> 01:17:56,011
We've gotta see if Hilly's
still on the train.

918
01:17:56,887 --> 01:17:59,822
How are we gonna do that and
you can't leave this compartment?

919
01:17:59,822 --> 01:18:03,223
Go down to the phony professor's room.
It's four cars back, room "C."

920
01:18:03,223 --> 01:18:05,659
Ask him what happened
to his secretary.

921
01:18:06,663 --> 01:18:08,324
Give me the gun.

922
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,491
Now give me your wallet.

923
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:15,733
- What the...
- I gotta get a disguise... a porter's uniform.

924
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:19,400
You know, these disguises
are getting expensive.

925
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,705
Crime costs.
Where's it at?

926
01:18:21,705 --> 01:18:25,440
Four cars back, room "C."
Stay out of trouble.

927
01:19:29,643 --> 01:19:32,806
- Hilly, are you all right?
- George, watch it.! Don't come in here.

928
01:20:02,074 --> 01:20:03,939
Are you all right?

929
01:20:03,939 --> 01:20:08,504
That's what I was gonna ask you.
I'm sorry about your head.

930
01:20:08,504 --> 01:20:12,483
I never would have gone back to the
compartment if I thought that you were gonna...

931
01:20:12,483 --> 01:20:14,986
- The Rembrandt letters.
- Devereau's got them.

932
01:20:14,986 --> 01:20:17,181
He found them in your jacket.

933
01:20:18,424 --> 01:20:22,485
- I guess I blew it.
- Poor George.

934
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:24,996
I tried not to get you involved,...

935
01:20:24,996 --> 01:20:28,522
but they came to me yesterday and they told me
that they'd killed the professor...

936
01:20:28,522 --> 01:20:30,831
and that unless I cooperated,
they'd kill me too.

937
01:20:30,831 --> 01:20:32,802
I thought that...

938
01:20:32,802 --> 01:20:35,772
I'd go along with them
and that then you'd get away.

939
01:20:35,772 --> 01:20:40,540
I was really happy when you did,
but I was afraid I'd never see you again.

940
01:20:47,185 --> 01:20:49,016
George, I was so frightened.

941
01:20:50,489 --> 01:20:52,787
So was I.

942
01:20:52,787 --> 01:20:54,951
I was scared you wouldn't be here.

943
01:20:56,895 --> 01:20:58,192
I missed you, Hilly.

944
01:20:59,631 --> 01:21:01,622
You did?

945
01:21:01,622 --> 01:21:03,691
I missed you too.

946
01:21:11,242 --> 01:21:13,710
You've got shoe polish
behind your ear.

947
01:21:18,849 --> 01:21:21,784
I'll explain that to you later.

948
01:21:21,784 --> 01:21:25,788
- Where are we?
- Just passing the Illinois River Canal.

949
01:21:25,788 --> 01:21:29,155
Well, how are you?
I hope I didn't slug you too hard.

950
01:21:29,155 --> 01:21:32,218
- Where's Devereau?
- Isn't that perfect?

951
01:21:32,218 --> 01:21:36,357
You want to see him,
and he wants to see you.

952
01:21:36,357 --> 01:21:38,765
Ladies first, hmm?

953
01:21:41,138 --> 01:21:42,627
Come in.

954
01:21:45,675 --> 01:21:48,405
Uh, please sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

955
01:21:48,405 --> 01:21:50,605
Miss Burns, how are you?

956
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:55,049
Bring us some fresh coffee, toast
and marmalade for our guests, would you?

957
01:21:55,049 --> 01:21:57,109
- Yes, sir.
- Right away.

958
01:22:01,224 --> 01:22:05,217
I'vejust been looking over
this correspondence you brought me...

959
01:22:05,217 --> 01:22:06,217
And...

960
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:08,992
uh, it's fascinating.

961
01:22:08,992 --> 01:22:11,590
The professor was right.
It's a remarkable find.

962
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:14,102
I'm almost tempted
to destroy it...

963
01:22:14,102 --> 01:22:18,663
but then on the other hand, I've always
had a soft spot for things of beauty.

964
01:22:18,663 --> 01:22:21,937
Particularly when they were genuine.

965
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,671
Whiney, would you put these
in my safe, please?

966
01:22:23,671 --> 01:22:26,213
I don't think they propose...

967
01:22:26,213 --> 01:22:28,408
any further threat. Do you?

968
01:22:35,891 --> 01:22:38,291
I hope you're not too disappointed
if this doesn't work.

969
01:22:38,291 --> 01:22:40,328
Oh, but on the contrary,
I think it will.

970
01:22:40,328 --> 01:22:43,922
This has been a very difficult project,
and I have made an error or two.

971
01:22:43,922 --> 01:22:48,231
One of them was bringing that man
Reace out here. What happened to him?

972
01:22:48,231 --> 01:22:50,328
I shot him.

973
01:22:50,328 --> 01:22:53,168
Good for you.
He probably deserved it.

974
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:55,640
You did have him kill
the professor, didn't you?

975
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:58,178
Oh, no. Oh, no.
On the contrary.

976
01:22:58,178 --> 01:23:01,408
He did that on his own.
An unfortunate mistake.

977
01:23:01,408 --> 01:23:05,612
I knew we couldn't kill the professor
until we had the Rembrandt letters.

978
01:23:05,612 --> 01:23:11,318
So I had to set up a scenario whereby
the, uh, professor was kidnapped...

979
01:23:11,318 --> 01:23:15,590
and an imposter impersonated him
in order to discredit him.

980
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:18,791
We would have killed him anyway, but
his escape attempt the other night...

981
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:20,493
upset the entire scheme.

982
01:23:20,493 --> 01:23:22,399
Come in.

983
01:23:23,471 --> 01:23:25,995
Excuse me, sir.
It's all confirmed.

984
01:23:25,995 --> 01:23:28,734
- The car will be waiting at Rockdale.
- Good.

985
01:23:28,734 --> 01:23:31,402
Oh, Mr. Caldwell,
you do rememberJohnson?

986
01:23:31,402 --> 01:23:34,072
He played the part
of the professor...

987
01:23:34,072 --> 01:23:38,208
and would have done the same thing
at Chicago, had it been necessary.

988
01:23:38,918 --> 01:23:41,478
How long before
we arrive at Rockdale?

989
01:23:41,478 --> 01:23:43,988
- About an hour and a half, sir.
- Thank you, Johnson.

990
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:47,825
Now all that remains
is to clear up a couple of points.

991
01:23:49,029 --> 01:23:50,690
Meaning the two of you.

992
01:23:50,690 --> 01:23:52,857
So I've arranged a new scenario...

993
01:23:52,857 --> 01:23:55,992
wherein you are responsible
for the murder of the professor.

994
01:23:55,992 --> 01:23:59,732
- Why would I kill the professor?
- To get the Rembrandt letters.

995
01:23:59,732 --> 01:24:03,241
He found out and you had to shoot him
because he tried to blackmail you.

996
01:24:03,241 --> 01:24:06,471
Which brings us
more or less up to date...

997
01:24:06,471 --> 01:24:10,037
Except that
in about 45 minutes from now...

998
01:24:10,037 --> 01:24:11,878
the professor's trusty secretary
is going to quarrel...

999
01:24:11,878 --> 01:24:15,784
with her partner/lover...

1000
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:19,187
and shoot him. And he dies...

1001
01:24:19,187 --> 01:24:22,386
but not before shooting her.

1002
01:24:26,832 --> 01:24:30,563
Ah, enough of this talk
of plots and scenarios.

1003
01:24:30,563 --> 01:24:33,230
Uh, join me in a cup
of coffee, would you?

1004
01:24:34,106 --> 01:24:35,697
Coffee, mister?

1005
01:24:40,611 --> 01:24:43,876
- Thanks.
- The professor's book
is still gonna be published.

1006
01:24:43,876 --> 01:24:46,815
Oh, yes, indeed, my dear.
But without the letters...

1007
01:24:46,815 --> 01:24:50,911
I'm afraid it will be regarded
as the jottings of a revisionist crank.

1008
01:24:50,911 --> 01:24:52,819
An ex-crank,
as a matter of fact.

1009
01:24:52,819 --> 01:24:56,587
The Silver Streak does have its drawbacks,
but please try the marmalade.

1010
01:24:56,587 --> 01:24:59,357
- They do provide an excellent cuisine.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

1011
01:24:59,357 --> 01:25:01,955
I'll tell the boys in the kitchen.
We aims to please.

1012
01:25:01,955 --> 01:25:03,762
- Coffee, miss?
- No, thanks.

1013
01:25:03,762 --> 01:25:07,293
- He ain't bullshittin' about the cuisine.
- Steward?

1014
01:25:07,293 --> 01:25:10,498
- Is that your lady, man? She's somethin' else.
- Steward!

1015
01:25:10,498 --> 01:25:13,634
- Stand up, mama. Let me get a look at you.
- Steward!

1016
01:25:13,634 --> 01:25:16,975
- Mm, mm, mm! Have mercy!
- Steward, you may go. Thank you very much.

1017
01:25:16,975 --> 01:25:19,777
- Just a little more coffee?
- No, thank you.

1018
01:25:19,777 --> 01:25:21,750
Half a cup?
Oh, sorry, sir.

1019
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:24,946
- Look what I've done.
- You... Get out of...

1020
01:25:24,946 --> 01:25:27,182
- See what I've done...
- You ignorant nigger!

1021
01:25:27,182 --> 01:25:29,191
Who you callin' nigger, huh?

1022
01:25:29,191 --> 01:25:31,352
You don't know me well enough
to call me no nigger!

1023
01:25:31,352 --> 01:25:33,726
I'll slap the taste out your mouth!
You don't even know my name!

1024
01:25:33,726 --> 01:25:35,958
I'll whoop your ass! Beat the white
of your ass.

1025
01:25:35,958 --> 01:25:38,193
- Who are you?
- I'm a thief.

1026
01:25:39,503 --> 01:25:42,768
It's all right, Hilly.
He's a friend of mine.

1027
01:25:42,768 --> 01:25:45,830
- Hello.
- Hi.

1028
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:48,308
- So this is Mr. Big.
- That's the man.

1029
01:25:49,245 --> 01:25:51,110
You ain't sayin' shit now, Mr. Big.

1030
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:54,877
I must admit that I'm slightly
at a loss for words.

1031
01:25:54,877 --> 01:25:57,544
But on the other hand,
I should warn you...

1032
01:25:57,544 --> 01:25:59,451
that you are a killer...

1033
01:25:59,451 --> 01:26:02,491
and you are wanted by the police
in every state...

1034
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:06,392
and I recommend that
you, uh, be careful.

1035
01:26:07,129 --> 01:26:10,758
You're the killer who's wanted
by the police in every state.

1036
01:26:11,967 --> 01:26:15,562
That man you had shot wasn't a vitamin
salesman. He was a federal agent.

1037
01:26:15,562 --> 01:26:18,607
They've been after you
for two years.

1038
01:26:18,607 --> 01:26:22,734
Ever since that plane crash
in Cologne, Germany...

1039
01:26:22,734 --> 01:26:26,076
when you caused a hundred people
to die, just to cover up your link...

1040
01:26:26,076 --> 01:26:28,843
with the scandal
at the Metropolitan Gallery.

1041
01:26:28,843 --> 01:26:32,375
So why don't we get them
the proof that they wanted?

1042
01:26:33,454 --> 01:26:36,184
Let's go and get
the Rembrandt letters.

1043
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:45,255
Get up.

1044
01:26:46,234 --> 01:26:48,031
If you insist.

1045
01:27:01,582 --> 01:27:03,345
- Get up, Whiney!
- Just do what he says.

1046
01:27:07,387 --> 01:27:09,378
Get the letters, Hilly.

1047
01:27:09,378 --> 01:27:11,253
Mr. Caldwell...

1048
01:27:11,253 --> 01:27:13,850
I take it that you are
a reasonable man and that,...

1049
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:17,761
like all men, you place
a reasonable value on your life.

1050
01:27:17,761 --> 01:27:19,321
Are you trying to bribe me?

1051
01:27:19,321 --> 01:27:23,165
No. I'm merely pointing out
that life is short...

1052
01:27:23,165 --> 01:27:26,934
and the smart man
hedges his bets.

1053
01:27:26,934 --> 01:27:29,201
You can't protect bets.

1054
01:27:29,201 --> 01:27:31,402
If there's one thing
I have learned from this trip...

1055
01:27:31,402 --> 01:27:34,537
it's that you play the game
and take what you get.

1056
01:27:34,537 --> 01:27:37,208
- I found them!
- Come here, Hilly.

1057
01:27:37,950 --> 01:27:39,110
Get the girl.!

1058
01:27:53,966 --> 01:27:56,560
What do you think this is?
A western?

1059
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:02,901
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to save our asses!

1060
01:28:02,901 --> 01:28:06,307
- I'm not jumping!
- There's a bridge coming up. Get ready!

1061
01:28:06,307 --> 01:28:09,609
Goddamn it, I'm not jumping!
I left this train twice already!

1062
01:28:09,609 --> 01:28:12,582
- Get ready.!
- I'm not jumping!

1063
01:28:12,582 --> 01:28:15,142
Here it comes! Go!

1064
01:28:18,757 --> 01:28:20,349
Son of a bitch!

1065
01:28:24,596 --> 01:28:26,086
Shit!

1066
01:28:27,399 --> 01:28:29,230
Not again!

1067
01:28:47,484 --> 01:28:49,247
What are we gonna do now?

1068
01:28:49,247 --> 01:28:52,153
All right.!
Hold it right there.!

1069
01:28:55,993 --> 01:28:57,551
Shit.

1070
01:29:26,923 --> 01:29:30,154
I just talked to Chaney. He'll have
the helicopter ready in Rockdale.

1071
01:29:30,154 --> 01:29:32,217
Just about five minutes from the station.

1072
01:29:33,229 --> 01:29:34,753
We'll be there in 46 minutes.

1073
01:29:34,753 --> 01:29:39,734
Is there any way of stopping
this train between here and there?

1074
01:29:39,734 --> 01:29:42,669
Aside from the engine, there's
an emergency brake in each car.

1075
01:29:43,639 --> 01:29:46,540
- Disconnect them.
- Okay. All of them?

1076
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:49,076
Yes, all of them.
And take her with you.

1077
01:29:50,178 --> 01:29:51,543
Come on.

1078
01:30:17,105 --> 01:30:19,266
They're yours.

1079
01:30:19,266 --> 01:30:21,809
- You George Caldwell?
- Will you please...

1080
01:30:21,809 --> 01:30:24,640
Would you just tell me...
Goddamn it!

1081
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:27,681
Would you please tell me what the hell
we're doing here and what you want from me!

1082
01:30:27,681 --> 01:30:30,046
- You are George Caldwell?
- Yes, I'm George Caldwell.

1083
01:30:30,046 --> 01:30:33,280
- I want some information from you, and fast.
- I did not kill Sweet.

1084
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:35,254
We know that. And if you weren't
so dumb,...

1085
01:30:35,254 --> 01:30:38,416
you would've realized that we planted
that news story for your own protection.

1086
01:30:38,416 --> 01:30:42,428
I've had men posted in every town
since Dodge City trying to pick you up...

1087
01:30:42,428 --> 01:30:44,623
while you're gallivanting around
the countryside wasting time.

1088
01:30:44,623 --> 01:30:48,634
- I didn't know they were federal agents!
- Well, let's see what you do know.

1089
01:30:51,305 --> 01:30:52,932
Here.

1090
01:30:52,932 --> 01:30:56,306
- How many men has Devereau got on the train?
- Two.

1091
01:30:56,306 --> 01:30:59,504
- What's his plan after they get to Chicago?
- He's not going to Chicago.

1092
01:30:59,504 --> 01:31:01,672
He's getting off at Rockdale.

1093
01:31:02,649 --> 01:31:04,810
I was afraid of that.
Okay.

1094
01:31:07,052 --> 01:31:09,543
Matthews, over here!

1095
01:31:11,056 --> 01:31:13,684
We're gonna stop the train
before Rockdale.

1096
01:31:13,684 --> 01:31:17,092
Closest is...
the Harris Mill Junction.

1097
01:31:17,092 --> 01:31:21,190
Contact the railroad. Tell them to make
out like it's a routine emergency inspection.

1098
01:31:21,190 --> 01:31:24,100
Have Bronsky bring his men
up in choppers from the south..

1099
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:26,866
Get all the passengers off the train,
and I don't want any slip-ups.

1100
01:31:26,866 --> 01:31:29,840
We'll be there as soon as we can.
Caldwell, you come with us.

1101
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,739
Steward, what do you want to do?

1102
01:31:31,739 --> 01:31:35,007
This has been a nerve-shattering
experience. I'd like to go home.

1103
01:31:35,814 --> 01:31:37,441
Take him anywhere he wants.

1104
01:31:37,441 --> 01:31:39,949
Okay, men, grab your rifles.
Let's move it.!

1105
01:31:39,949 --> 01:31:43,044
Caldwell, your shells.

1106
01:31:43,788 --> 01:31:44,508
Let's go.!

1107
01:31:45,957 --> 01:31:49,654
- What does he think I'm gonna do with this?
- Blow the tires out on the train.

1108
01:31:50,428 --> 01:31:51,690
Thanks for everything.

1109
01:31:54,032 --> 01:31:55,431
My pleasure.

1110
01:31:56,434 --> 01:31:58,732
Goddamn it.!
Caldwell, get out here.!

1111
01:31:58,732 --> 01:32:02,261
If there's ever anything
that you need...

1112
01:32:06,010 --> 01:32:07,340
don't call me.

1113
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,207
Don't let 'em get you killed.

1114
01:32:16,119 --> 01:32:19,213
Take it easy, killer.
Stay loose.

1115
01:32:35,172 --> 01:32:37,333
Where'd you like to go, fella?

1116
01:32:37,333 --> 01:32:38,738
Well..

1117
01:32:41,210 --> 01:32:43,405
I left myJag in Kansas City.

1118
01:32:58,027 --> 01:33:00,257
I don't know, Frank,
but that's what they said.

1119
01:33:00,257 --> 01:33:02,524
Everybody off
at the Harris Mill Junction.

1120
01:33:02,524 --> 01:33:06,694
Everybody off?
Okay, I'll tell my crew.

1121
01:33:27,022 --> 01:33:31,254
- Why are they stoppin' the train?
-I don't know, sir. Tryin' to get some security check here.

1122
01:33:31,254 --> 01:33:33,521
That's the damnedest thing
I ever heard!

1123
01:33:33,521 --> 01:33:36,462
- They want us to get off the train?
- Yeah.

1124
01:33:37,933 --> 01:33:40,299
- Hey, there's the police!
- Watch your step. Watch your step.

1125
01:33:40,299 --> 01:33:42,666
- Well, I'll be...
- Come on, get back!

1126
01:33:42,666 --> 01:33:45,672
You guys are just totally uncontrollable.
You know that?

1127
01:33:56,050 --> 01:33:57,608
- The police are here.
- What?

1128
01:33:57,608 --> 01:34:00,279
The porters are askin' everyone
to get off the train.

1129
01:34:02,389 --> 01:34:04,084
Are they?

1130
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:10,023
Keep moving towards the clearing, please.

1131
01:34:12,132 --> 01:34:16,228
This is a routine investigation.
None of you is in danger.

1132
01:34:17,805 --> 01:34:21,502
Please cooperate with us so we can
complete our investigation quickly...

1133
01:34:21,502 --> 01:34:24,703
and get you back aboard
and on your way.

1134
01:34:28,401 --> 01:34:29,702
Please keep moving...

1135
01:34:37,323 --> 01:34:38,847
Excuse me.

1136
01:34:41,561 --> 01:34:43,426
Yeah, excuse me.

1137
01:34:47,634 --> 01:34:51,070
- Everybody off, please, Mr. Devereau.
- Yes. What's happening here, Conductor?

1138
01:34:51,070 --> 01:34:54,163
We're not sure. We got a call from
the police wanting everyone evacuated.

1139
01:34:54,163 --> 01:34:56,902
- Maybe it's a bomb scare.
- A bomb scare?

1140
01:34:56,902 --> 01:34:59,705
- Then we'd better get off.
- I certainly am.

1141
01:35:37,615 --> 01:35:39,515
Stay with her.

1142
01:35:39,515 --> 01:35:43,178
Cover us from the window. We're gonna
start the engine and take this thing to Rockdale.

1143
01:35:43,178 --> 01:35:47,748
Hey, what are you doin'? Everybody's gone.
What are you doin' with those rifles?

1144
01:35:52,063 --> 01:35:54,122
You bastards!

1145
01:35:56,967 --> 01:35:59,731
Everyone's off, Chief,
except our boy.

1146
01:36:01,472 --> 01:36:03,099
Hold it right there, Devereau!

1147
01:36:54,456 --> 01:36:56,253
- Shit!
- Take it easy, killer.

1148
01:36:56,253 --> 01:36:58,486
What are you doing here?

1149
01:36:59,762 --> 01:37:01,923
What's going on?
Who's in charge here?

1150
01:37:01,923 --> 01:37:03,589
Would you get down!

1151
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,391
What did you come back here for?

1152
01:37:09,938 --> 01:37:13,465
- Uh... I forgot your wallet.
- Oh, some thief you are.

1153
01:37:14,510 --> 01:37:17,138
- Is that your old lady Hilly?
- Yeah.

1154
01:37:20,214 --> 01:37:21,704
Okay, follow me.

1155
01:37:33,294 --> 01:37:35,319
- Start the engine.
- We can't do that.

1156
01:37:36,297 --> 01:37:38,857
You, move, start it.

1157
01:38:10,764 --> 01:38:13,665
Mr. Devereau.
Mr. Devereau!

1158
01:38:23,510 --> 01:38:25,273
Guido, come with me!

1159
01:38:50,703 --> 01:38:53,365
Keep your foot on the pedal.

1160
01:39:13,291 --> 01:39:15,486
- Come on!
- Where are we going?

1161
01:39:15,486 --> 01:39:17,619
We're getting off at the next stop.

1162
01:39:20,431 --> 01:39:22,991
- What are you doing?
- This is combat.

1163
01:39:51,995 --> 01:39:53,519
Watch out for the engineer.

1164
01:39:57,534 --> 01:39:59,024
Sit!

1165
01:40:29,799 --> 01:40:32,233
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

1166
01:40:32,233 --> 01:40:34,292
How about Grover?

1167
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:40,131
Are you all right?

1168
01:40:40,131 --> 01:40:42,302
- Is it over?
- Shit.!

1169
01:41:10,338 --> 01:41:11,828
Look out!

1170
01:41:15,443 --> 01:41:18,879
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1171
01:41:22,649 --> 01:41:24,583
Just give me one more pass.

1172
01:41:47,608 --> 01:41:50,771
Just give me one clear shot.

1173
01:42:25,445 --> 01:42:27,276
- What happened?
- Don't look. Don't look!

1174
01:42:32,918 --> 01:42:35,944
All right, get theJunction
on the radio.

1175
01:42:35,944 --> 01:42:38,319
Tell them they've got
a runaway train.

1176
01:42:39,091 --> 01:42:41,286
Hey, we're comin'
into the station.

1177
01:42:55,340 --> 01:43:00,175
George, why didn't we stop?
What's going on here?

1178
01:43:00,175 --> 01:43:02,645
I'm not sure, but I don't think
that there's anyone in the engine.

1179
01:43:02,645 --> 01:43:05,012
- No driver?
- That's right.

1180
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:07,141
Oh, God!

1181
01:43:07,141 --> 01:43:09,709
Whiney cut
all the emergency cords.

1182
01:43:09,709 --> 01:43:11,721
What are we gonna do?

1183
01:43:13,891 --> 01:43:17,019
- Well, we have to find some way to get to the engine.
- How?

1184
01:43:19,063 --> 01:43:20,553
The roof?

1185
01:43:21,999 --> 01:43:24,832
I think so.
Come on!

1186
01:43:35,279 --> 01:43:37,509
- How's it going?
- They don't believe us.

1187
01:43:37,509 --> 01:43:41,744
Look, the engineer is probably anxious
to bring the train in on schedule.

1188
01:43:44,053 --> 01:43:46,214
This is Chief Donaldson.
Who's this?

1189
01:43:46,214 --> 01:43:49,087
This is Jerry Jarvis.
I'm the assistant controller.

1190
01:43:49,087 --> 01:43:51,150
Assistant? Get me your boss.

1191
01:43:51,150 --> 01:43:55,357
Uh, he's out to lunch, but I'm sure
I can handle any problem you might have.

1192
01:43:55,357 --> 01:43:59,026
It's not my problem. You've got a dead
engineer and a runaway train...

1193
01:43:59,026 --> 01:44:02,196
- that's gonna hit Chicago in 15 minutes.
- What are you gonna do about it?

1194
01:44:02,196 --> 01:44:05,400
All right, I'll check
with the signal towers.

1195
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:07,909
But, uh, you see,
it's impossible.

1196
01:44:07,909 --> 01:44:10,878
If the engineer is dead,
who's driving the train?

1197
01:44:20,656 --> 01:44:23,181
- What's happening?
- Hey, you all right?

1198
01:44:23,181 --> 01:44:26,318
- Listen, is there any way...
- Holy moley! The killer!

1199
01:44:26,318 --> 01:44:28,192
- No, he's okay.
- Listen to me.

1200
01:44:28,192 --> 01:44:31,130
Is there any way to get to the engine
without going over the roof?

1201
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:33,464
There ain't no way to get to the engine,
period!

1202
01:44:33,464 --> 01:44:36,993
- Why are we goin' so fast?
- Because there's no one driving this train.

1203
01:44:36,993 --> 01:44:40,530
- Impossible. It would stop.
- Does this look as if we're stopping?

1204
01:44:41,343 --> 01:44:44,540
No, the hell it don't.!
I better go pull the emergency cord.

1205
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:46,979
The emergency cords
have been cut.

1206
01:44:46,979 --> 01:44:48,778
Damn hippies!

1207
01:44:51,219 --> 01:44:55,588
I received a report from the signal towers.
They see no engineer in the cabin.

1208
01:44:55,588 --> 01:44:57,521
Great. Now you've got the facts.

1209
01:44:57,521 --> 01:45:00,584
Throw one of those switches
and have the train run off.

1210
01:45:00,584 --> 01:45:04,927
That's the problem.
All the tracks are computer programmed.

1211
01:45:04,927 --> 01:45:07,729
Switching the Silver Streak would only
cause a collision with another train.

1212
01:45:07,729 --> 01:45:11,465
Then what the hell are you gonna do?
There are people riding on that train.

1213
01:45:11,465 --> 01:45:13,370
Oh, no.

1214
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:14,999
You see, the standard procedure...

1215
01:45:14,999 --> 01:45:18,102
in such an emergency
would be to derail the train.

1216
01:45:18,102 --> 01:45:19,942
Derail it?
In the middle of the yard?

1217
01:45:20,948 --> 01:45:25,281
Yes. Actually,
I can't take that responsibility.
Uh, I'd better get my boss.

1218
01:45:25,281 --> 01:45:28,321
You better do something,
you idiot, because in 10 minutes...

1219
01:45:28,321 --> 01:45:30,379
you're gonna have
200 tons of locomotive

1220
01:45:30,379 --> 01:45:33,984
smashing through Central Station
on its way to Marshall Fields!

1221
01:45:38,064 --> 01:45:41,500
- Where are we going?
- If you wanna stop this train, you got to follow me!

1222
01:45:45,972 --> 01:45:48,304
Hey, Jack,
have you seen Benny?

1223
01:45:48,304 --> 01:45:50,935
Uh, yeah, yeah. I saw him
in the coffee shop, Jerry.

1224
01:46:00,085 --> 01:46:02,883
Now what we have to do
is uncouple the cars.

1225
01:46:02,883 --> 01:46:05,947
You gotta pull up that bar,
turn it to the left.

1226
01:46:05,947 --> 01:46:09,620
When they pull apart, they will
bust open the air pressure lines...

1227
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:12,892
and the brakes will clamp on throughout
the train, then you can jump on back.

1228
01:46:13,565 --> 01:46:15,863
- But that's dangerous.!
- Impossible, man.

1229
01:46:16,769 --> 01:46:18,361
Grab hold of my belt.

1230
01:46:18,361 --> 01:46:20,305
- What are you gonna do?
- Guess!

1231
01:46:26,878 --> 01:46:30,541
- Have you seen Benny?
- Well, if it isn't the little Caesar of the railroad.

1232
01:46:30,541 --> 01:46:33,583
- Have you seen Benny!
- No. No!

1233
01:46:33,583 --> 01:46:35,015
Try next door.

1234
01:47:17,159 --> 01:47:18,251
What's the matter?

1235
01:47:18,251 --> 01:47:20,989
The Silver Streak is a runaway.
What do we do?

1236
01:47:22,331 --> 01:47:24,458
Jesus! It's gonna be here
in four minutes!

1237
01:47:40,816 --> 01:47:42,749
Your attention, please.

1238
01:47:42,749 --> 01:47:45,752
May I have
your attention, please.

1239
01:47:45,752 --> 01:47:49,779
You are requested to walk to
the nearest exit as quickly as possible.

1240
01:47:49,779 --> 01:47:51,348
Please do not run.

1241
01:47:51,348 --> 01:47:54,554
Walk as quickly
as possible to the nearest exit.

1242
01:47:55,363 --> 01:48:00,426
People waiting for the arrival
of the Silver Streak on track five...

1243
01:48:00,426 --> 01:48:02,663
are requested to vacate
that area immediately.

1244
01:48:24,858 --> 01:48:30,262
This is an emergency. Please continue
to the nearest exit where a station security...

1245
01:48:51,518 --> 01:48:56,045
Exit as quickly as possible.
You must leave the building..

1246
01:50:18,669 --> 01:50:22,002
We did it! We made it!
We made it, man! Whoo!

1247
01:50:22,002 --> 01:50:23,471


1248
01:50:24,408 --> 01:50:25,898
Holy shit!

1249
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:32,249
Hello, Chicago! Hello!

1250
01:50:32,249 --> 01:50:34,181
Gotta drink to that!

1251
01:50:50,166 --> 01:50:53,533
I don't know about you,
but next time I'm gonna take the bus.

1252
01:50:53,533 --> 01:50:56,800
Maybe I'm crazy,
but it looks as if it's grinning.

1253
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:59,774
Yeah, like the cat
who swallowed the canary.

1254
01:50:59,774 --> 01:51:02,174
- Where's Grover?
- I don't know.

1255
01:51:10,386 --> 01:51:13,582
Take it easy, killer.
Stay loose!

1256
01:51:15,490 --> 01:51:17,287
What's he doing?

1257
01:51:17,287 --> 01:51:19,020
He's crazy.

1258
01:51:20,062 --> 01:51:22,553
Crazy? He's got the right idea.

1259
01:51:22,553 --> 01:51:25,532
- Let's get outta here and go to a park.
- A park?

1260
01:51:25,532 --> 01:51:28,035
Yeah. I want
to lie back on the grass...

1261
01:51:28,035 --> 01:51:30,765
and have you teach me
some more about gardening.
