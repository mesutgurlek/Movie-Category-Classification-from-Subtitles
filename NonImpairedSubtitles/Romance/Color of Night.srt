00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:41,230
What is it with you? Don't you want
me to find out who kiIIed your friend?

445
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:44,274
- No, I don't have a warrant.
- AII right, come on in.

446
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:47,236
- Open the gate.
- Yeah, right.

I'II teII her
you said so.

but me, goddamn it.

- I do not Iike guns.
- You prefer knives?

458
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:03,270
- I need you to do me a favor.
- What's that?

459
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:07,232
- I want you to teII the group
about Moore's death.
- Me?

460
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:09,234
- Yes.
- Why?

461
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:11,236
WeII, maybe one of them
won't come in.

462
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:15,240
Or maybe they wouId aII come in,
but then you wouId be abIe
to spot something wrong.

463
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:19,244

- I just had aII the mess
in his office cIeaned up.

couId just get an estimate, okay?

Yeah.

520
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:52,207
- What are you teIIing me?
- He was murdered.

- [ Sondra ] Here?
- Yes, right here in the office.

523
00:38:56,295 --> 00:39:00,299
Was he shot, stabbed, beaten?
Have they got a suspect? A motive?

00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:02,301
Three days go by
and you don't caII us?

525
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:05,262
- I thought it'd be easier
if you heard it together.
- Oh, I see.

526
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:07,264
So even Bob's death
is group therapy. That's great.

527
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:10,267
Hey, Bob, thanks for giving us
a chance to grieve together. Shit!

528
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:13,228

I need to know more!
- He was stabbed to death.

529
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:17,232
- How many times was he stabbed?
- This man was Bob's best friend!

530
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:20,235
- Do you reaIIy need exact numbers now?
- [ BiII ] Sondra!

- Get your fucking hands off me.
- It's okay. It's okay.

532
00:39:26,241 --> 00:39:29,286
- [ Casey ] It doesn't make sense to me!
- Many times, CIark.

533
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:32,206
More than 30.
That's aII I can teII you.

534
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:35,209
It wasn't a thief.
I'II teII you that right now.

535
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,294
- I agree.
- Why stab a guy 30 times?

536
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:41,256
Bob-- He'd piss in his pants if
you showed him a knife. You know that.

537
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:44,176
- What are you saying?
- I am saying, Sondra...

538
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:47,221
that you reaIIy have to hate a person
to stab him that many times!

539
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:51,225
You're a shrink, right?
You know what kind of power
peopIe hand over to shrinks.

540
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:54,228
WeII, maybe sometimes they hand over
more than they want to.

541
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:56,271
That is absoIuteIy correct.

542
00:39:56,271 --> 00:40:01,235
A thief wouId not stick around
to stab someone 30 times.

543
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:04,279
[ Buck ] Since when did you become
such an expert on robbery?

544
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:07,282
It's not the robbery
he's an expert on. It's the rage.

545
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:11,245
W-What are we gonna do now?
I-I mean us.

546
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:16,208
- Th-The group.
- I bet Dr. Capa has an idea.

547
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,211
What does he mean?

548
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:25,217
I think Casey
is suggesting that I...

549
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,261
may have some pIan
to repIace Bob.

550
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:35,227
- Maybe you shouId.
- No, I can't do that. Not right now.

551
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:37,271
- Why? Why not?
- For one reason or another...

552
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:40,232
I'm more screwed up
than you peopIe are.

553
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:42,234
I was just being
obnoxious and Ioud before.

554
00:40:42,317 --> 00:40:46,238
- Anybody have a fuckin' Xanax?
- [ Sondra ] I have a Librium.

555
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,241
- [ Buck ] Stop with the drugs.
- It wouId be a good idea if you stayed.

556
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:52,160
- [ Buck ] Body isn't coId yet.
- There'd be some connection.

557
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:55,289
You were Bob's best friend.

558
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:58,250
You-- You seem
kind of Iike him.

559
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,211
It'd be so much easier
to trust you.

560
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:05,257
I know what kind of a force
group can become in your Iives.

561
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:08,177
You... teII things here.

562
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:11,263
Intimate things that you wouIdn't
teII your best friend.

563
00:41:13,223 --> 00:41:15,184
I'm very fIattered
that you wouId, uh--

564
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:24,193
But the truth is, you are
the peopIe that make this work.

565
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:28,280
I wiII be more than happy to try
and find someone for you to
continue this, but I cannot--

566
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:32,242
Does my opinion
count for anything?

567
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:34,244
I wouId Iike to ask...

568
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:38,207
why it is you feeI
so inadequate for the task.

569
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:41,210
Maybe he just
don't Iike us.

570
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:43,253
- No, that's not it, Buck.
- [ CIark ] Shh!

571
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:46,173
[ Buck ]
Why don't you step on something?

572
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:54,264
Six weeks ago, I spoke
harshIy to a patient...

573
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:56,225
and she committed suicide.

574
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:01,230
Right in front of me.

575
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:10,197
Perhaps she wouId have done this anyway.
That's what my coIIeagues say.

576
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:12,199
But I don't know.

577
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:15,202
Oh, I'm so sorry.

578
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:20,207
And my patient--

579
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:22,251
her name was MicheIIe--

580
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:29,258
jumped out of a wi--
window in my office.

581
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:34,179
- Oh.
- So much bIood.

582
00:42:35,222 --> 00:42:37,266
So red, and I--

583
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:40,269
And right, uh,
before my eyes...

584
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:44,231
the red, uh,
disappeared.

585
00:42:44,273 --> 00:42:49,236
Just turned to gray, and so
I don't see... red now.

586
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:53,240
But, see, I was her doctor.

587
00:42:53,282 --> 00:42:57,244
And I faiIed.
So I can't heIp you.

588
00:42:59,288 --> 00:43:02,249
I don't think that you want someone
Iike me around right now.

589
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:05,169
I think I do.

590

That DaIe is

But he obviousIy seems
to care for Richie a great deaI.

There's a big gap in Richie's Iife
