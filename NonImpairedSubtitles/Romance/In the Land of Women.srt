1
00:00:38,894 --> 00:00:42,273
Let us be honest with ourselves.

2
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:52,408
I believe that we always knew
that this won't work.

3
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,128
Crankcase?

4
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:10,509
I care a lot...

5
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:14,639
and in certain way
if I love you, and I don't want to hurt you.

6
00:01:17,602 --> 00:01:21,518
Crankcase should say something.

7
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:24,216
Not you have left
of speaking from the day that I met you.

8
00:01:27,344 --> 00:01:31,640
Does it excuse, your you are?,
if you are, Sofía Bunuel.

9
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,561
My God, we are your admirers I number one.
I have watched your movie a million times.

10
00:01:35,853 --> 00:01:37,354
I have the DVD.

11
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,774
It is very sweet, thank you.

12
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,484
Would you give us your autograph?

13
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:42,610
Clear.

14
00:01:42,777 --> 00:01:45,654
Alone he/she writes "For Todd: maricón
pathetic I will never be with vos."

15
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:47,865
Of agreement.

16
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:53,855
Thank you.

17
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:02,447
He/she looks, you what you said...

18
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,158
but you have to listen to me.

19
00:02:06,576 --> 00:02:09,288
All that that you, is that I need space.

20
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:13,250
Not I know that it will happen...

21
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,919
perhaps with
the time who knows.

22
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,838
Nobody knows.

23
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,926
But now I need
that you give me my space.

24
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,436
It is well.

25
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,140
I want to make it, I want
to give you the whole space that you need...

26
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:30,434
but I don't think that you have that
to finish with me.

27
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,644
I have to leave.

28
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:37,190
Please wait, not me dejeas this way,
he/she speaks a little more with me.

29
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,734
Not I can.

30
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:41,821
Good-bye.

31
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:34,885
He/she has a new message.

32
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:37,137
The following message,
it was not still listened.

33
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:43,185
"It is Bobby, I read your script yesterday, you know
it is supposed that it is soft pron of first..."

34
00:03:52,353 --> 00:03:55,314
Hello what you make here?

35
00:03:57,525 --> 00:04:00,278
Alone I came to look for...

36
00:04:01,487 --> 00:04:02,405
I don't know that I came to look for.

37
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:07,294
Does he/she wait, are you crying?

38
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:08,995
A little.

39
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:11,998
He/she was conversing with my mom.

40
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:15,232
I believe that she has many problems.

41
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:18,671
She won't be... depressed
as everybody it is?

42
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:20,881
No, she is convinced
that he/she is dying.

43
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:24,010
- Is it sick?
- Not I know, I don't believe it.

44
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:25,895
The doctor doesn't see him/her anything bad.

45
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:29,900
But this so afraid one,
and one doesn't eat to help her...

46
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:32,194
I feel so bad for her.

47
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:36,824
In any way, I will go soon there,
and I will see like I fight with that.

48
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:39,010
I should go.

49
00:04:43,097 --> 00:04:45,266
I Will Go to Michigan,
and I will stay with the grandmother.

50
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:46,767
What is there of your work?

51
00:04:46,892 --> 00:04:49,345
I need to write, and you don't know that
here in Michigan I cannot make it?

52
00:04:49,346 --> 00:04:51,346
Not it requires a lot of effort.

53
00:04:51,414 --> 00:04:55,335
He/she will also give me the opportunity of
to write on what I always wanted.

54
00:04:56,044 --> 00:04:58,296
About Genghis Khan?

55
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:00,132
No, on the other thing.

56
00:05:00,232 --> 00:05:01,389
On the secondary?

57
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:03,700
If, don't say this way it because it sounds stupid.

58
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:06,513
It is alone that you wanted to write
that since you had fifteen.

59
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:10,383
I believe that if I write on that, I will give him/her
less attention to her, and more to my life.

60
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:12,462
How will Sofía feel?

61
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,214
I believe that well,
it has just finished with me.

62
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:18,509
Sofía left me.

63
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,330
Are you joking?

64
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,331
When?

65
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:26,293
He/she makes an hour and a half, there was traffic.

66
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,380
- Maybe it is only...
- No.

67
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:33,175
He/she finished, he/she left.

68
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,002
Shit, shit!

69
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:37,338
Please, you could control yourself.

70
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:39,256
I had a horrible day...

71
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,676
Not I can support that you act
as if it was the end of the world.

72
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:42,777
I sit down it affection.

73
00:05:42,818 --> 00:05:43,894
It is that it is so beautiful!

74
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:46,030
It is so amusing and grandiose.

75
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:51,102
Crankcase, I sit down it! As you you are?

76
00:05:51,202 --> 00:05:52,103
Are you well?

77
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:53,813
No.

78
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:57,526
You that this will sound as something
that a mother has to say, but...

79
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:58,527
it is the true.

80
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:00,445
You will be well.

81
00:06:01,154 --> 00:06:04,074
I mean, these things take time.

82
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:06,333
Sometimes, a lot of time.

83
00:06:06,368 --> 00:06:08,650
You know, still treatment of forgetting...

84
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:10,497
to Rodney Portchman, of second grade.

85
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:13,417
Not count the history of Rodney,
please.

86
00:06:13,609 --> 00:06:15,820
Single treatment of telling you
that you will be well.

87
00:06:16,487 --> 00:06:17,966
Your you know that the women
they always liked tí...

88
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:19,782
since small eras.

89
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:24,078
And one day at least you wait for it,
you will know a wonderful girl.

90
00:06:24,412 --> 00:06:26,879
Not I want to know a girl...

91
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:31,460
I don't want to know anybody,
alone I want to be alone with my grandmother.

92
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:32,861
And their cat.

93
00:06:51,105 --> 00:06:53,107
You are a nerd!

94
00:07:09,883 --> 00:07:11,426
Will you leave tonight?

95
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:12,727
Not you.

96
00:07:12,928 --> 00:07:14,847
Maybe, why?

97
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:16,641
It is Friday at night.

98
00:07:16,932 --> 00:07:18,434
Will you go out with Gabe Foley, not?

99
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:20,269
Be quiet!

100
00:07:21,163 --> 00:07:24,833
I have to live through you, I am very
youth to have my own life.

101
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,211
Ok, but I would like it
that you didn't speak this way.

102
00:07:27,253 --> 00:07:28,671
As it is.

103
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,468
Lucy, they come to the kitchen.

104
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:40,258
How was your day?

105
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:42,677
Well. What does it happen?

106
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:44,387
Anything.

107
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:50,185
Good it passes something,
it is not so important.

108
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:54,981
Can he/she wait?
I have some things that to make.

109
00:07:58,902 --> 00:08:02,280
I want go to see Dr. Bennet today.

110
00:08:03,072 --> 00:08:04,699
Why?

111
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:10,872
I found a species
of bundle...

112
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,540
in my chest.

113
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,420
My God.

114
00:08:16,837 --> 00:08:20,424
Not we still know anything,
it is possible that it is not anything...

115
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:24,637
if there is something... it could not be anything.

116
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,268
Mom.

117
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:36,065
Your papa took me to the hospital
on Tuesday in the morning...

118
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:38,276
to make me some tests.

119
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,777
He/she should go with you.

120
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,154
No.

121
00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:45,534
It is better than you go to the school we will try 
this as any other problem.

122
00:08:46,953 --> 00:08:48,755
Is it well?

123
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,057
If.

124
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:53,500
Lucy.

125
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,880
Everything will be well.

126
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:00,507
Seriously.

127
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:11,256
Hello grandmother.

128
00:10:12,716 --> 00:10:16,643
He/she waits, grandmother.
I am me, Crankcase, your grandson.

129
00:10:16,678 --> 00:10:18,930
Agnes is my mom,
he/she is also your daughter. Hello.

130
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:23,893
Not I can believe that still this alive one.

131
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:28,949
Not I can believe that I lived
to see your face another time.

132
00:10:30,326 --> 00:10:34,288
Thank you, I am also happy,
although he/she would not say it in that way.

133
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:36,498
Do you believe that it can happen?

134
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,960
Through the door.

135
00:10:40,794 --> 00:10:42,463
Where is the cat?

136
00:10:42,614 --> 00:10:44,073
Dead

137
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:48,786
Do you know how to cook?

138
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:50,052
A little.

139
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:53,458
Not I have eaten anything
in three weeks.

140
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,710
Seriously?

141
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,395
I ate something of pasta.

142
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:06,696
When he/she dies...

143
00:11:06,905 --> 00:11:08,698
do you want this house?

144
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:10,951
Not I believe that it is so simple.

145
00:11:11,243 --> 00:11:13,745
It is my house, I can be given it
to who wants.

146
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:16,540
Good, thank you,
then we will see.

147
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:20,544
I am hungry.

148
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:28,353
Hello.

149
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:29,645
Hello, I am here.

150
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:30,897
Thanks to God.

151
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,859
Crankcase, this it is the worst idea
that you have had in your life.

152
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,278
I know it, you mentioned it several times.

153
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,354
Well, I go it stops there.

154
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:39,674
No, he/she listens,
alone you allow me to attempt it.

155
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,259
I still believe that this
it is exactly what I need now.

156
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:44,720
Alone I need to regroup myself...

157
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,015
Somebody calls you.

158
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:52,770
Hello.

159
00:11:53,104 --> 00:11:54,063
Crankcase, are you?

160
00:11:54,105 --> 00:11:54,981
Avi?

161
00:11:55,773 --> 00:11:57,692
I am now for the mountain,
the service works bad.

162
00:11:57,727 --> 00:11:59,694
As you got this numero?

163
00:12:00,194 --> 00:12:01,821
I have my methods,
your mother gave it to me.

164
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,416
Esucha, this is an emergency,
we have to speak now.

165
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:07,502
You gave Avi this number.
What does he/she spend?

166
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:08,885
Now I have to make this.
I call you later.

167
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,340
I am walking for the Sep, there is
such a hot girl that...

168
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:14,134
you would fry eggs in their bottom.

169
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:16,302
Leaving that of side,
she has a problem...

170
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:18,311
she doesn't understand, and fracamente
me neither, why...

171
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:22,058
he/she has to go to bed with the type
that him this installing internet...

172
00:12:22,093 --> 00:12:25,520
if he/she is already making it
with their yoga instructor?

173
00:12:25,554 --> 00:12:29,350
Maybe because dijistes that you wanted 
the scene to be able to seduce her?

174
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:31,977
If, I don't believe that he/she can
to convince her with that.

175
00:12:32,061 --> 00:12:33,813
Something more?

176
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,649
It could be that her really
he/she wants to have internet of wide band.

177
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,542
Do you make yourself the comic, now?

178
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:40,045
He/she listens, tell to Mónica
that he/she is a nymphomaniac, well?

179
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:44,466
For their dramatic childhood, he/she has
sex with many types.

180
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:46,944
It is the only way that he/she has
an orgasm, that is everything.

181
00:12:47,361 --> 00:12:49,926
<i > That is alone a phase,
you will overcome it.</i>

182
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:52,491
Grandmother, you could hang the telephone,
please?

183
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:53,582
Where devils these?

184
00:12:53,617 --> 00:12:56,495
I am outside of the city for some days,
I cannot speak now.

185
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,463
I will send you a new script
on Monday or Tuesday.

186
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:03,919
You should have seen it,
with their top and a short...

187
00:13:04,336 --> 00:13:06,588
Hey, friend, my grandmother this in the line.

188
00:13:22,313 --> 00:13:25,859
Grandmother is not angry with you
I told it to you three hours ago.

189
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:27,068
To where do you go?

190
00:13:27,318 --> 00:13:28,528
Alone I will throw the garbage.

191
00:13:28,945 --> 00:13:29,696
What?

192
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:31,114
Already return.

193
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:55,273
Thank you.

194
00:14:18,806 --> 00:14:20,015
Fuzz!

195
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:21,600
Does it excuse?

196
00:14:22,017 --> 00:14:23,602
The name of the dog is Fuzz.

197
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:27,815
Ah! Hello, hello Fuzz.

198
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:32,412
Your you should be the male nurse.
Did you come to take care Phyllis?

199
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,835
No, in fact he/she is my grandmother.

200
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,004
Your grandmother?

201
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,966
Not wise that taenia
children or grandsons.

202
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,344
If, we don't come to visit her
very followed.

203
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,046
From where are you?

204
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:50,214
L.A.

205
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:52,716
Los Angeles.

206
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,803
I was there once,
a long time ago.

207
00:14:55,838 --> 00:14:57,436
Not you could sweeten yourself.

208
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:59,640
No, I liked it, I liked it a lot.

209
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,561
I Am Sarah.

210
00:15:04,895 --> 00:15:07,022
Crankcase.
A pleasure to know you.

211
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:13,371
So you come at time to happen with
your grandmother, that is pleasant.

212
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,499
If, I will be here for a while.

213
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,670
We are being about arriving
to an agreement in which I take care of it.

214
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,131
It is enough work.

215
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,009
Him you, I am worried for that reason.

216
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:26,835
Don't worry.

217
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:27,919
No?

218
00:15:28,044 --> 00:15:29,337
No, you anger well.

219
00:15:29,713 --> 00:15:32,048
Thank you, I appreciate it.

220
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:40,240
Devils!

221
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:44,014
It will be better than I leave,
before my daughter...

222
00:15:44,015 --> 00:15:46,080
look at me like to the person
more shameful of the world.

223
00:15:46,372 --> 00:15:47,915
I hate that look...

224
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:51,669
probably because
he/she made it to my mother.

225
00:15:53,672 --> 00:15:55,090
It is a beautiful night.

226
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:58,134
If, I suppose that it is it.

227
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:03,556
Hello Lucy, do you want to go ahead?

228
00:16:03,615 --> 00:16:04,566
No, it is well.

229
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:08,269
I already return.

230
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:14,484
Hello.

231
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,290
This will sound strange, but my
parents don't know that I smoke...

232
00:16:20,624 --> 00:16:22,459
so I ask you you not to count them.

233
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:24,586
Do you have one now?

234
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,380
No.

235
00:16:27,172 --> 00:16:28,632
Perhaps. Why?

236
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,260
Because I will take it of hostage.

237
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:22,080
I speak of the radiology center for
to confirm Sarah's consultation Hardwicke...

238
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:23,373
that it is reserved
for tomorrow Tuesday.

239
00:18:36,974 --> 00:18:40,943
<i > it Traveled with their fingers their legs
until arriving to the crotch...</i>

240
00:18:40,978 --> 00:18:43,606
<i > being about controlling
for not passing over the one it limits.</i>

241
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,609
We have to maintain this professional.

242
00:18:47,068 --> 00:18:52,114
Perhaps we can consider it
as services 'Special to the client'...

243
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:05,689
<i > you Notice on Poyecto
"West L.A. high School."</i>

244
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:15,584
<i > "Sofía - I miss You. And I sit down" it.</i>

245
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:25,159
Hello.

246
00:19:25,617 --> 00:19:26,452
Hello.

247
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:32,048
Hello Phyllis, how does he/she go you?

248
00:19:32,924 --> 00:19:34,885
She is Mrs. Hardyng.

249
00:19:35,469 --> 00:19:36,887
Hardwicke.

250
00:19:37,554 --> 00:19:39,222
To who he cares it.

251
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:41,933
Grandmother, I take charge, thank you.

252
00:19:44,144 --> 00:19:45,687
I sit down it.

253
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:49,232
Good, I made some cookies.

254
00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:51,068
Thank you.

255
00:19:52,235 --> 00:19:54,446
They are very wrapped up.

256
00:19:54,605 --> 00:19:55,773
If.

257
00:19:55,556 --> 00:19:59,560
After baking them I put them
in a plate and I wrapped them with plastic...

258
00:19:59,595 --> 00:20:01,145
to give you the impression that...

259
00:20:02,647 --> 00:20:04,774
The truth is that I am
terrible cooking.

260
00:20:04,775 --> 00:20:05,548
It is a fact.

261
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,319
No. Thank you.
My grandmother is hungry.

262
00:20:08,354 --> 00:20:11,447
Totally hungry,
what is enough agitator.

263
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:16,486
The truth, that was
an excuse to come here.

264
00:20:17,362 --> 00:20:19,218
I know that it is strange,
but it is a beautiful day...

265
00:20:19,781 --> 00:20:21,074
and I have to walk the dog...

266
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:23,869
and I thought that perhaps you wanted...

267
00:20:24,286 --> 00:20:25,078
If, well.

268
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:27,080
Grandiose. Seriously?

269
00:20:27,414 --> 00:20:28,957
Alone you give me one minute.

270
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:31,536
In the airplane, when leave here...

271
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,957
I fastened my computer and I began to reread
some mails that I sent him/her.

272
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:36,958
They were as thirty.

273
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:39,690
In most, clear,
they spoke of our relationship.

274
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:41,963
And I don't speak to you of short messages...

275
00:20:41,998 --> 00:20:44,882
but of long and letters of love.

276
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:48,720
Treatment hopelessly of
to be romantic...

277
00:20:48,755 --> 00:20:49,721
or what is.

278
00:20:49,823 --> 00:20:53,827
And although it sounds shameful,
I realized...

279
00:20:53,862 --> 00:20:55,919
that it was the best thing that I have written.

280
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:59,040
Because it was frank and idealistic...

281
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:02,076
as the artists they would say: that it is
the prettiest history that I never saw.

282
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:03,086
And I am writing it.

283
00:21:04,838 --> 00:21:06,506
Then, when I saw myself there
reading the mails in the turbulence...

284
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,057
among in panic.

285
00:21:09,092 --> 00:21:14,180
I began to feel panic,
as it had never felt it.

286
00:21:15,014 --> 00:21:17,475
And I believe that me this happening because...

287
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:22,397
I cannot imagine
to feel something like that more for anybody.

288
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:23,363
Never more.

289
00:21:23,398 --> 00:21:29,028
He/she listens, never in my life I received one
letter like those that your you sent him/her.

290
00:21:29,863 --> 00:21:32,580
Neither I wrote this way one.

291
00:21:32,615 --> 00:21:36,619
You are fortunate of not having more anything 
that to do especially with that girl.

292
00:21:36,654 --> 00:21:38,329
But you already know that.

293
00:21:38,555 --> 00:21:40,724
I should sound so young for you.

294
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,060
If, well, jodete friend.

295
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,355
We go, it was not my intention.

296
00:21:46,814 --> 00:21:48,023
Him you.

297
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:51,860
You know, I show off of being
somebody that knows how to listen...

298
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:54,863
but when I know somebody new
alone I want to speak.

299
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:55,864
Why is that?

300
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:59,326
Perhaps in fact you are not
so good listening.

301
00:21:59,743 --> 00:22:03,247
Perhaps in fact you are not
so good listening.

302
00:22:03,347 --> 00:22:06,809
No, it is not that, if I know how to listen.

303
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:08,420
Then it is so...

304
00:22:08,937 --> 00:22:12,941
I see myself to myself speaking of the career
of Nelson, Lucy's paintings.

305
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:16,403
He/she should have my own motivations,
commitments, but not.

306
00:22:16,695 --> 00:22:18,447
And that I am thinking...

307
00:22:18,947 --> 00:22:20,949
<i > Where am I? Who am?</i>

308
00:22:21,158 --> 00:22:22,847
Let me him to ask something.

309
00:22:22,882 --> 00:22:25,336
What do you make exactly? With your days.

310
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:30,517
You know, that is so typical.
Always the same supposition.

311
00:22:30,552 --> 00:22:33,805
"If you don't have work or you don't go 
to the school, you are always so alone."

312
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,806
That ridiculous!

313
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,184
Most of the days don't have neither
five seconds for my same one.

314
00:22:39,686 --> 00:22:42,647
I have to take to somebody, to solve 
the house problems, the food...

315
00:22:42,682 --> 00:22:45,048
without mentioning
other 15 more tasks.

316
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:47,527
I sit down it, not the wise thing.

317
00:22:48,111 --> 00:22:50,488
Well, you that not,
but my family neither knows it.

318
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,136
I can feel resentment of all,
especially of Lucy.

319
00:22:56,095 --> 00:22:59,098
Without caring that that
make everything it disappoints him/her.

320
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:02,560
Good, it is normal, she is
an adolescent and you their mother.

321
00:23:02,595 --> 00:23:05,187
Would it be strange that he/she didn't feel this way, not?

322
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:09,316
I sit down it.
I have to think on that.

323
00:23:09,351 --> 00:23:10,317
And to find what fails.

324
00:23:11,694 --> 00:23:13,244
Perhaps it should force me more.

325
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:15,322
God! Not I want to remember my life...

326
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:20,911
and to see how much she resembles me.

327
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,626
It was very pleasant, thank you.

328
00:23:28,544 --> 00:23:32,548
Of anything, it was very good to speak with you.

329
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:33,549
Clear.

330
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,550
Well

331
00:23:36,728 --> 00:23:38,354
Shit.

332
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:39,981
What does it happen?

333
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:45,070
I need to have the last word.

334
00:23:45,071 --> 00:23:46,071
If?

335
00:23:46,072 --> 00:23:47,072
If.

336
00:23:48,406 --> 00:23:52,327
Good, I will go inside, and me
you scream something while I leave.

337
00:23:53,036 --> 00:23:54,412
- Grandiose.
- Perfect.

338
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:01,211
You will be well.

339
00:24:06,935 --> 00:24:10,313
What do you find to make ésto again?
Perhaps tomorrow...

340
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,118
I sit down it tomorrow I am not able to,
I have a commitment.

341
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:15,995
Good, don't worry.

342
00:24:16,412 --> 00:24:17,496
On Wednesday?

343
00:24:17,746 --> 00:24:19,331
If, it would be grandiose.

344
00:24:19,915 --> 00:24:21,000
I will come to see you.

345
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:22,334
I suppose...

346
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,627
Crankcase.

347
00:24:35,281 --> 00:24:38,868
Will it be grandiose? That idiot.

348
00:24:39,452 --> 00:24:43,456
Mom, I no longer want to speak of
this doesn't want to fight with you.

349
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,377
Not it is a fight,
it is not anything important.

350
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:51,381
What I mean is that basically
you will be alone there, take it to the cinema.

351
00:24:52,382 --> 00:24:55,010
Do you have idea of the embarrassing thing that it would be?

352
00:24:55,045 --> 00:24:57,638
That would be definitively very serious,
really.

353
00:24:58,013 --> 00:25:00,057
Are they clever to make history?

354
00:25:02,476 --> 00:25:07,397
Perhaps be right affection, it will be
uncomfortable and we don't know anything about the type.

355
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:09,740
Forget it. Alone you forget it.

356
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:12,618
I thought that perhaps they would rot
to make something good for somebody...

357
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:15,989
but both
they unite in my against.

358
00:26:07,151 --> 00:26:09,153
This is happening because all
we are very afraid.

359
00:26:09,188 --> 00:26:12,323
So I will tell you the same thing that to her.

360
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:16,661
What is that they find tomorrow
we will fight together with it.

361
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:21,455
You daughter wants to request you apologize,
and that if you really want it, her...

362
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:25,253
it will cross the street right now
and he/she will invite the madwoman's grandson to leave.

363
00:26:25,503 --> 00:26:28,339
He/she is a sweet boy,
I feel bad for him.

364
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:30,800
It hurts him/her the heart.

365
00:26:34,254 --> 00:26:37,633
I will be with you the whole time.

366
00:26:55,476 --> 00:26:57,729
What does it happen?

367
00:26:58,312 --> 00:26:59,612
Alone I have curiosity.

368
00:26:59,647 --> 00:27:03,359
Pensastes that perhaps can stay 
blocked in one of those positions?

369
00:27:05,361 --> 00:27:07,363
Yes.

370
00:27:08,682 --> 00:27:10,308
Does he/she list to sleep?

371
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,703
You know that the yoga increases the circulation...

372
00:27:13,738 --> 00:27:17,575
and that it also reduces the anxiety?

373
00:27:17,783 --> 00:27:19,452
If, I read it.

374
00:27:21,078 --> 00:27:22,705
Maybe you should prove it.

375
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:28,711
Do you know what?

376
00:27:32,131 --> 00:27:37,636
Lament if I seem
distracted lately.

377
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:39,221
This well.

378
00:27:48,214 --> 00:27:49,799
Good night.

379
00:27:51,926 --> 00:27:53,470
Do you have my pills?

380
00:27:53,762 --> 00:27:57,265
If, they are tranquilizing
very strong, these.

381
00:27:58,058 --> 00:28:00,560
Is it safe to take them once and for all all?

382
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:06,858
I love them.

383
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,245
Who did change the sheets?

384
00:28:17,578 --> 00:28:18,955
I made it.

385
00:28:32,093 --> 00:28:34,595
Who is Sofía?

386
00:28:35,706 --> 00:28:37,708
How do you know about her?

387
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:40,127
The flames in your dreams.

388
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:42,129
What you make in my room
while I sleep?

389
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:45,007
It is a good question.

390
00:28:48,528 --> 00:28:50,328
Good, he/she is my girlfriend.

391
00:28:50,363 --> 00:28:53,575
But he/she doesn't want to be
more with me.

392
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:55,702
Is it beautiful?

393
00:28:56,911 --> 00:28:59,122
The truth, is spectacular.

394
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:01,916
That is very important.

395
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,699
<i > he/she was walking
down the street...</i>

396
00:29:34,075 --> 00:29:38,079
<i > looking for to alquien for me...</i>

397
00:29:38,114 --> 00:29:39,080
<i > a woman...</i>

398
00:29:39,247 --> 00:29:40,839
I Am Sofía.

399
00:29:40,874 --> 00:29:44,335
<i > that is looking for
to a man.</i>

400
00:29:44,377 --> 00:29:46,963
I am completely
in love of tí.

401
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:47,929
<i > Now, I have hopes...</i>

402
00:29:47,964 --> 00:29:50,842
<i > that that feeling
it will be good...</i>

403
00:29:50,877 --> 00:29:52,559
<i > and I continue imagining...</i>

404
00:29:52,594 --> 00:29:54,888
<i > if it will go out with me
this night.</i>

405
00:29:55,472 --> 00:29:57,098
Good-bye.

406
00:30:15,684 --> 00:30:18,312
Hello, how these?

407
00:30:21,356 --> 00:30:22,149
If?

408
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:24,234
Do you know where these?

409
00:30:24,318 --> 00:30:25,778
Alone regrouping me.

410
00:30:30,324 --> 00:30:32,034
I can take you to house if you want.

411
00:30:32,535 --> 00:30:35,121
No, I am well,
I have to continue running.

412
00:31:00,489 --> 00:31:04,493
My mom and I fight.

413
00:31:04,785 --> 00:31:07,079
In fact it was not a fight,
it was...

414
00:31:07,114 --> 00:31:08,998
She wanted that me...

415
00:31:09,206 --> 00:31:13,419
he/she asks you if you want to go
to the cinema or something.

416
00:31:14,421 --> 00:31:18,348
I told him/her that it would be uncomfortable and...

417
00:31:18,383 --> 00:31:19,766
probably the last
that you want to make.

418
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:24,306
Do I mean, a girl as me?
It would be as making charity.

419
00:31:24,307 --> 00:31:26,307
It is strange.

420
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:30,854
They allow you to leave in one
school night?

421
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:32,606
In fact not.

422
00:31:33,648 --> 00:31:38,111
If you take me to the cinema,
will an exception be?

423
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:40,614
I don't know it.

424
00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:43,742
Of agreement,
discover it and you warn me.

425
00:31:51,718 --> 00:31:53,261
What does it happen?

426
00:31:54,137 --> 00:31:58,141
It is possible,
I believe that perhaps...

427
00:31:59,643 --> 00:32:02,062
my toilet is covered.

428
00:32:02,145 --> 00:32:05,148
Perhaps?
Which is the variable?

429
00:32:05,265 --> 00:32:07,830
The water is running outside...

430
00:32:07,865 --> 00:32:10,396
and the floor all wet one is.

431
00:32:10,438 --> 00:32:14,483
I will see it, before I should take a shower and then
I will commit suicide.

432
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:32,801
I believe that I will say it to alone Paige.

433
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:37,684
He/she will get scared less if I tell it to him
and you see that I am well.

434
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:38,901
I believe that you are right.

435
00:32:40,111 --> 00:32:42,655
But I want that your
say it to Lucy.

436
00:32:46,826 --> 00:32:48,828
It is better this way.

437
00:32:50,204 --> 00:32:54,173
He/she told me: discover it and you warn me.

438
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:58,379
Not it was what waited,
I found that it is...

439
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,505
Interested?

440
00:32:59,523 --> 00:33:00,815
If something like that.

441
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:04,778
I worry about him to be uncomfortable.

442
00:33:04,813 --> 00:33:05,744
Make it.

443
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:06,745
Do you believe?

444
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,663
If. You should make it.

445
00:33:08,698 --> 00:33:12,744
And you should also take me with you.

446
00:33:21,028 --> 00:33:23,781
But it is worth them that me
say that it happens.

447
00:33:25,024 --> 00:33:26,745
I really want an ice cream.

448
00:33:26,746 --> 00:33:29,487
I have been thinking of that
the whole day. Who does want to come with me?

449
00:33:29,488 --> 00:33:30,488
How? he/she waits...

450
00:33:31,698 --> 00:33:34,159
do you want to go to take an ice cream?

451
00:33:35,743 --> 00:33:37,328
Do they know what?

452
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:41,583
Go without us, Lucy and me
we will go for a walk with Fuzz.

453
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:42,984
We go, it will be good.

454
00:33:51,301 --> 00:33:53,344
Does it hurt you?

455
00:33:56,222 --> 00:33:58,099
No.

456
00:34:01,053 --> 00:34:05,057
The chemotherapy can be hard,
perhaps me of nauseas...

457
00:34:06,475 --> 00:34:09,520
and he/she can get tired.

458
00:34:11,272 --> 00:34:13,107
These afraid one?

459
00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:16,534
If, sometimes.

460
00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:20,907
But now not,
now I feel quite strong.

461
00:34:23,493 --> 00:34:25,119
You are not very strong.

462
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:33,253
I took twenty dollars of your handbag.

463
00:34:33,712 --> 00:34:35,130
Seriously? When?

464
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:39,051
A while ago, in February.

465
00:34:40,802 --> 00:34:42,387
Seriously?

466
00:34:42,388 --> 00:34:43,388
If...

467
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,214
he/she loved you a while ago it.

468
00:34:48,515 --> 00:34:50,825
I sit down not well for that reason.

469
00:34:50,826 --> 00:34:51,861
Apologize.

470
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:55,167
Only for curiosity.
For what reason did you need them?

471
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,668
It is stupid.

472
00:34:57,503 --> 00:35:01,841
He/she wanted to begin to save,
you already know for the future...

473
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:10,266
but non taenia anything,
so he/she needed a collaboration.

474
00:35:10,383 --> 00:35:14,262
Good, at least you are reponsable
financially.

475
00:35:15,889 --> 00:35:20,268
I tell it to you because,
I don't want us to have secrets.

476
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,879
This well to stay sews for
yourself, do you know?

477
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:25,982
If, but I don't want.
I always tell you the truth.

478
00:35:26,775 --> 00:35:29,194
Because you always
do you tell me the truth, well?

479
00:35:31,571 --> 00:35:33,031
It is well.

480
00:35:33,282 --> 00:35:38,454
If you say that everything will be well, I believe you
because I know that you don't lie me.

481
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:40,039
Because you never lie me.

482
00:35:40,074 --> 00:35:42,166
Perhaps to others.

483
00:35:42,876 --> 00:35:44,795
Perhaps to Lucy.

484
00:35:45,087 --> 00:35:46,400
Perhaps to dad.

485
00:35:46,713 --> 00:35:47,714
But not to me.

486
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:56,974
Alone I want to know...

487
00:35:58,266 --> 00:35:59,768
if truth will be well?

488
00:36:40,245 --> 00:36:41,162
Hello.

489
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:46,793
What does it happen?

490
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,963
I came you to look for,
we are for today the other time.

491
00:37:00,682 --> 00:37:02,183
How did he/she call himself?

492
00:37:02,517 --> 00:37:03,518
Pardon?

493
00:37:03,893 --> 00:37:05,353
The girl to which you wrote him/her
all those letters.

494
00:37:05,729 --> 00:37:06,980
Sofia.

495
00:37:08,732 --> 00:37:10,484
Was your first love?

496
00:37:12,027 --> 00:37:15,989
There were other girls in the school
but with anybody it lasted.

497
00:37:16,024 --> 00:37:18,290
It projected my fantasies
in those girls...

498
00:37:18,325 --> 00:37:19,875
and when it felt that they liked
it felt that...

499
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:25,332
they also faked that they liked,
and there was not anything to make.

500
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:27,501
Alone they lasted a couple of months.

501
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:29,637
Was Sofia different?

502
00:37:30,221 --> 00:37:32,223
If, good you already know.

503
00:37:35,143 --> 00:37:37,854
No, in fact I believe that it was same.

504
00:37:43,026 --> 00:37:45,528
They come, there is something that I want to show you.

505
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:51,126
This is touching.

506
00:37:51,752 --> 00:37:53,513
Do you know to where we go?

507
00:37:53,514 --> 00:37:56,799
I sit down as if we were
to a Castle to give something.

508
00:37:57,633 --> 00:37:59,218
I love it here.

509
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,224
I have all those fantasies
of science fiction, of being able to say...

510
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:09,902
Of seeking that not you
that I was in other lives...

511
00:38:09,937 --> 00:38:13,816
that I can walk for this forest,
as in another time...

512
00:38:13,851 --> 00:38:15,609
and in a different place.

513
00:38:16,102 --> 00:38:17,312
I love it.

514
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:33,010
My husband has an adventure.

515
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:36,882
I discovered it a while ago,
and non hize anything in this respect.

516
00:38:39,961 --> 00:38:43,631
I tell myself to my same one...
it is due to the girls...

517
00:38:48,928 --> 00:38:52,932
We have a very comfortable life, very
clean, am I good in that, do you know?

518
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:59,014
And the matter is that it is a type
very decent and he/she knows how to stay.

519
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:04,728
It is their credo I suppose, I don't know it.

520
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:08,049
It should sound very bacano for tí.

521
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:12,970
No, not you neither that to say,
I cannot say anything.

522
00:39:15,931 --> 00:39:19,852
The thing is that I no longer sit down that I love him.

523
00:39:20,853 --> 00:39:22,271
Not as you the owners...

524
00:39:22,855 --> 00:39:27,526
to that girl that hurt you,
especially when it is good.

525
00:39:29,779 --> 00:39:33,783
The same day that fights with her,
the same day that we speak...

526
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:36,410
it was also in doubt
if he/she loved her in that way.

527
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:44,886
I would like it a lot
to hug you now, would that be strange?

528
00:40:08,511 --> 00:40:10,471
Lucy cannot know about Nelson.

529
00:40:10,972 --> 00:40:11,806
Not there is problem.

530
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:12,807
Well.

531
00:40:12,808 --> 00:40:14,408
You know what I mean...

532
00:40:14,976 --> 00:40:18,146
You know, she asked me
if he/she could invite you to the cinema?

533
00:40:18,521 --> 00:40:22,317
Specifically in day of school, for him 
general I don't allow it to leave in days of week.

534
00:40:23,151 --> 00:40:24,986
That is responsible.

535
00:40:26,154 --> 00:40:27,655
I will make an exception.

536
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,057
I suppose that tomorrow you will have...

537
00:40:29,558 --> 00:40:31,268
Yes I have another commitment.

538
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:36,644
Not I know when we rot
to make this again.

539
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:39,293
Perhaps in a couple of days,
perhaps but.

540
00:40:39,328 --> 00:40:41,170
I have many things that to make.

541
00:40:44,173 --> 00:40:45,550
I have to go to the store.

542
00:40:45,883 --> 00:40:46,676
I will accompany you.

543
00:40:46,801 --> 00:40:47,593
- Ok.
- It is well.

544
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:53,725
It had never been in New York, I loved it,
I remember that was seated alone...

545
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:57,906
eating my wings, in Mets,
where have all those things...

546
00:40:57,907 --> 00:41:01,266
and schoolgirls' pictures.

547
00:41:01,427 --> 00:41:05,812
And suddenly I had this feeling
that it was awake.

548
00:41:06,438 --> 00:41:12,027
Finally awake.  And my life
it was exactly where it should be.

549
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:18,461
And the other day sat down away from the school
waiting Paige...

550
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:23,111
and she came running, I enter to my choche,
and he/she began to be on their day...

551
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:24,047
and I had the same feeling again.

552
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:28,810
As if diciera: It is "ésto, it is here
where I should be, here with her."

553
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:34,784
Alone he/she would want to be able to appreciate
everything a little but.

554
00:41:35,544 --> 00:41:38,839
I imagine how many moments
good this way pus to have, do you know?

555
00:41:39,548 --> 00:41:43,051
I want to return to New York,
and to sit down alone in Meet.

556
00:41:45,387 --> 00:41:48,724
I would like to be person's type
that he/she ate up that chocolate...

557
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:52,936
and to eat it right here,
inside the store.

558
00:41:53,187 --> 00:41:56,023
Good, you would should.

559
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,214
I believe that I should say you a little
but about as this my life.

560
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,425
Of agreement but later
I want to tell you something.

561
00:42:15,093 --> 00:42:17,011
This well, your first.

562
00:42:17,221 --> 00:42:18,972
Well, alone I mean...

563
00:42:20,307 --> 00:42:22,810
that your husband should be crazy.

564
00:42:28,941 --> 00:42:32,945
So, what did you want to tell me?

565
00:42:34,113 --> 00:42:36,323
Anything, was not so important.

566
00:42:48,594 --> 00:42:50,179
<i > First message.</i>

567
00:42:51,347 --> 00:42:55,351
<i > we Need to talk about plans to long 
term like when you will come home?...</i>

568
00:42:58,021 --> 00:42:59,647
<i > you Call me, good-bye.</i>

569
00:43:05,496 --> 00:43:06,914
Mr.?

570
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,918
Salt of there.

571
00:43:19,635 --> 00:43:20,928
What?

572
00:43:21,821 --> 00:43:24,491
I am I, want to show you something,
it is important.

573
00:43:27,202 --> 00:43:28,870
These well dressed one.

574
00:43:29,412 --> 00:43:32,999
If, today is, do you remember?
The appointment with the handsome one of in front.

575
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,208
If, alone I thought that...

576
00:43:35,209 --> 00:43:37,504
with all that happens,
you would no longer want to go.

577
00:43:39,547 --> 00:43:43,433
When it scares me something of the life,
I investigate in internet.

578
00:43:43,468 --> 00:43:45,879
In the last days...

579
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,682
I read all that was me possible envelope
the situation that we are facing.

580
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:50,558
Seriously?

581
00:43:51,268 --> 00:43:54,271
The most probable thing is that they finish
making a mastectomy.

582
00:43:55,056 --> 00:43:57,809
That will be very difficult...

583
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:00,728
we will have to take care of it and to support her.

584
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:05,226
And in 3 weeks
the chemotherapy began.

585
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,520
Her that said?

586
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,762
Yes, but in these days much people...

587
00:44:09,763 --> 00:44:11,649
he/she makes the chemotherapy and radiation.

588
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,777
And doesn't that kill you of the fright?

589
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,237
Undoubtedly if but...

590
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,803
as I am not an oncologist neither anything...

591
00:44:20,804 --> 00:44:24,090
alone I can help
with that of tonight.

592
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:32,205
He/she thought of eating something before.

593
00:44:32,206 --> 00:44:34,084
Do you like crankcase the pizza?

594
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,579
Here they have an exquisite pizza.

595
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,680
Yes, I adore the pizza.

596
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,653
I was as you of small.

597
00:44:41,129 --> 00:44:41,880
Very feminine?

598
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:42,881
Precocious.

599
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,137
I sometimes like it.

600
00:45:06,463 --> 00:45:10,259
Do you joke? She is grandiose,
I rented their movie in DVD.

601
00:45:10,759 --> 00:45:13,762
And I read the other day that
it goes out with Colin Farrell.

602
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:17,841
I will go to the bathroom.

603
00:45:24,049 --> 00:45:25,500
Control you, you a man.

604
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:26,501
Not you are weak, neither pathetic.

605
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:29,888
You have to continue ahead.

606
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,853
I know you.

607
00:45:38,104 --> 00:45:40,523
Not you of what you speak.

608
00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:48,800
My worst fear is that when leaving the bathroom
after throwing me a good one shitted.

609
00:45:49,501 --> 00:45:53,119
And that all this covered one
of... you already know...

610
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,830
of my shit.

611
00:45:54,913 --> 00:45:58,000
And I will know to another type
in the bathroom.

612
00:45:58,434 --> 00:46:00,103
Is that your worst fear?

613
00:46:00,645 --> 00:46:02,021
It is among the worst.

614
00:46:05,525 --> 00:46:07,360
It continues putting on better.

615
00:46:10,321 --> 00:46:11,114
Hello.

616
00:46:11,515 --> 00:46:12,715
Hum... hello.

617
00:46:15,243 --> 00:46:17,120
Were they known in the bathroom or something?

618
00:46:19,122 --> 00:46:20,748
Your you are Eric Watts?

619
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:23,626
If, I suppose that I am it.

620
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,837
Did You Work in Julieta of N.Y.?

621
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:31,375
I love it, I love that work.

622
00:46:32,252 --> 00:46:33,462
He/she didn't know it.

623
00:46:34,838 --> 00:46:36,298
If, I made the car.

624
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:38,425
Camaro?

625
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,261
Impressive, very impressive.

626
00:46:42,012 --> 00:46:44,973
Basically, I changed it,
I armed it again.

627
00:46:45,724 --> 00:46:49,728
That which requires a lot
money, which I don't have.

628
00:46:50,388 --> 00:46:52,682
Hence, that work.

629
00:46:57,395 --> 00:46:59,981
What do they make?
The time happening.

630
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:04,986
Not exactly, Lucy's mama
it forced us to watch a movie...

631
00:47:05,528 --> 00:47:08,239
because I am very depressed lately.

632
00:47:10,409 --> 00:47:12,392
We should leave, we have money...

633
00:47:12,393 --> 00:47:15,255
for the goodies
and Paige is hungry.

634
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:19,490
Well, enjoy the movie
and the food.

635
00:47:19,491 --> 00:47:24,942
It was a pleasure to know you,
be which your name is.

636
00:47:26,663 --> 00:47:28,549
Tell me something.

637
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:34,683
You were born in the suburbs
of Michigan, in a school average.

638
00:47:35,226 --> 00:47:40,989
Count me on soccer, and the bands
of garage like that of Johnny.

639
00:47:41,983 --> 00:47:42,984
Who?

640
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:47,717
I am very old.

641
00:47:47,806 --> 00:47:48,807
Not you did go to the secondary?

642
00:47:49,475 --> 00:47:53,687
I went to a school deprived in L.A.

643
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,564
With many privileges,
anything of drugs.

644
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,381
Not him you, I felt never that was...

645
00:48:00,382 --> 00:48:02,685
a classic experience,
as always I wanted.

646
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:05,073
For example, there was not
a soccer team.

647
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,700
Neither it is here as the 50

648
00:48:08,701 --> 00:48:11,855
I mean, perhaps be not
as fascinating as L.A...

649
00:48:11,997 --> 00:48:14,349
But we are not completely frank.

650
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,801
We make things.

651
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:17,895
As what?

652
00:48:17,912 --> 00:48:18,830
If. As what?

653
00:48:19,231 --> 00:48:20,232
If. As what?

654
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:23,928
Let us watch the movie
of Colin Farrell.

655
00:48:24,261 --> 00:48:25,513
No, better not.

656
00:48:27,348 --> 00:48:29,141
That it passes with you and that type?

657
00:48:34,271 --> 00:48:35,523
The pass very well today, Paige.

658
00:48:36,065 --> 00:48:36,941
Seriously?

659
00:48:37,274 --> 00:48:38,234
Undoubtedly if.

660
00:48:38,734 --> 00:48:39,819
I will sleep.

661
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:41,862
This well.

662
00:48:44,949 --> 00:48:46,842
Thank you to pay for me today.

663
00:48:47,535 --> 00:48:48,744
If, good night.

664
00:48:49,237 --> 00:48:50,447
Crankcase?

665
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,740
If?

666
00:48:52,657 --> 00:48:54,159
Would you marry me?

667
00:48:54,784 --> 00:48:55,952
If.

668
00:49:13,354 --> 00:49:15,481
<i > to listen their messages,
one press.</i>

669
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,232
<i > Not he/she has new messages.</i>

670
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:31,340
This is my room.

671
00:49:32,223 --> 00:49:34,141
If, shelter you.

672
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:36,435
Why?

673
00:50:02,947 --> 00:50:05,324
I believe that I am going out with the marshal
of field of the soccer team.

674
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:12,248
Not you, what it is but popular
that that?

675
00:50:15,852 --> 00:50:17,145
Are you speaking to me seriously?

676
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:21,733
Not we are leaving really.

677
00:50:23,902 --> 00:50:26,571
Alone the time passes, a lot.

678
00:50:29,183 --> 00:50:30,309
He calls himself Gabe.

679
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:34,021
And I like it, alone that...

680
00:50:34,022 --> 00:50:36,317
you acordás of the type
of the commercial center?

681
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,751
Eric?

682
00:50:37,752 --> 00:50:41,403
He/she is their best friend,
they make everything together.

683
00:50:43,913 --> 00:50:49,723
They are very different, Gabe inspires
trust until it seems arrogant.

684
00:50:50,605 --> 00:50:51,606
Have you kissed him?

685
00:50:52,357 --> 00:50:54,192
If, something like that.

686
00:50:56,603 --> 00:50:57,521
Not really.

687
00:50:59,231 --> 00:51:00,023
He/she defines to kiss.

688
00:51:01,107 --> 00:51:02,234
Why not?

689
00:51:13,463 --> 00:51:15,214
My papa has an adventure.

690
00:51:17,759 --> 00:51:20,790
The thing is that I am not
angry with the...

691
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:22,591
I say, if he am but...

692
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,266
I am angry with my mom.

693
00:51:26,485 --> 00:51:27,319
That doesn't sound exactly.

694
00:51:27,686 --> 00:51:29,814
Him you. It is that...

695
00:51:31,615 --> 00:51:33,548
I am not able to understand it.

696
00:51:33,867 --> 00:51:37,913
She is so cold and superficial.

697
00:51:38,506 --> 00:51:41,718
She is obsessed with making
of our lives as if it was a cover.

698
00:51:43,303 --> 00:51:48,907
He/she sometimes screams for anything, and other it is shown
too much calm. It is difficult, and more now.

699
00:51:51,511 --> 00:51:53,396
Because you tell me this?

700
00:51:55,607 --> 00:51:57,525
Not him you, I sit down it.

701
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,530
Your mama said that
you were a painter.

702
00:52:02,807 --> 00:52:07,093
Not I am a painter.
Alone I make it from time to time.

703
00:52:07,094 --> 00:52:10,800
You know, to calm down
and not to leave my stalls

704
00:52:11,755 --> 00:52:13,590
In fact,
that it is not my problem

705
00:52:13,693 --> 00:52:16,127
Which is your problem?

706
00:52:18,464 --> 00:52:21,132
He/she scares me to kiss Gabe Foley.

707
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:22,967
You overcame it, it trusts my.

708
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,137
In their moment, you will know
to the fair person, and everything will be well.

709
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:34,187
My mother doesn't know anything about my father.

710
00:52:35,288 --> 00:52:37,400
So, thank you.

711
00:52:41,395 --> 00:52:42,187
Grandmother?

712
00:52:43,981 --> 00:52:45,436
Not you have to make that...

713
00:52:45,437 --> 00:52:47,276
I will clean everything when it finishes.

714
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:48,277
Can you wait?

715
00:52:51,472 --> 00:52:52,765
That it is that noise?

716
00:52:53,224 --> 00:52:54,183
My cellular one?

717
00:52:54,517 --> 00:52:55,309
If.

718
00:52:56,894 --> 00:52:59,546
Insurance is my boss that is...

719
00:52:59,547 --> 00:53:02,198
calling to warn me
that I no longer have work.

720
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,819
You are a salesperson of inputs
of swimming piletas?

721
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:08,197
That? I am a writer.

722
00:53:08,974 --> 00:53:10,392
What do you write?

723
00:53:12,603 --> 00:53:13,979
I write books for children.

724
00:53:14,047 --> 00:53:16,960
That well, I love children.

725
00:53:17,261 --> 00:53:20,061
Not it is true.
I liked them.

726
00:53:20,527 --> 00:53:24,256
Now I feel the effect them. But I can read
one of your books.

727
00:53:24,865 --> 00:53:27,785
Not I have one with me
so it will be difficult.

728
00:53:28,661 --> 00:53:32,539
I had loved it
to read them before dying.

729
00:53:38,546 --> 00:53:42,550
Grandmother, I hate to be me
who tells you this...

730
00:53:42,951 --> 00:53:45,485
but not these dying.

731
00:53:46,346 --> 00:53:48,100
That is not happening.

732
00:53:48,101 --> 00:53:52,050
So, please
you could stop to say that.

733
00:53:53,561 --> 00:53:56,064
You know that it is a
funeral service?

734
00:53:56,065 --> 00:53:57,841
Oh, God.

735
00:54:00,485 --> 00:54:05,850
When you find my body, single flame
to people that knows about this.

736
00:54:06,408 --> 00:54:08,715
They fixed everything.

737
00:54:08,716 --> 00:54:13,100
They will put me in a bag
and they took me to the morgue.

738
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:15,761
I asked them to incinerate me.

739
00:54:16,062 --> 00:54:19,240
The number of the mortuary of Michigan...

740
00:54:19,241 --> 00:54:22,690
it is in the table of the living,
you want to see it.

741
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:25,891
They should bring
the delivery.

742
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,140
That is a relief. The soup
that you prepared it is disgusting.

743
00:55:04,035 --> 00:55:09,249
Four days have passed,
it was concerned, I thought that maybe...

744
00:55:09,374 --> 00:55:12,461
You that Lucy told it to you, him you.

745
00:55:14,597 --> 00:55:17,308
He/she made it so that me not...

746
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,018
Lucy is not anything.

747
00:55:23,439 --> 00:55:27,610
Sick, enough sick person am.

748
00:55:34,309 --> 00:55:36,019
I have cancer of he/she suckles.

749
00:55:39,873 --> 00:55:43,245
Tomorrow I should go...

750
00:55:43,246 --> 00:55:47,339
to the hospital, there me... shit!

751
00:55:48,966 --> 00:55:52,719
They will intersect... my God.

752
00:55:55,347 --> 00:55:56,848
Shit!

753
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:10,450
Sarah, looks at me.

754
00:56:10,451 --> 00:56:14,230
I am here,
I promise you that everything will be well.

755
00:56:14,731 --> 00:56:16,200
Everything will be well.

756
00:56:24,927 --> 00:56:28,389
Not I wanted...

757
00:56:44,298 --> 00:56:48,219
<i > "For Sarah" < /i>

758
00:56:57,854 --> 00:57:02,067
"There was a bear once
of called peluche Pandy"

759
00:57:04,236 --> 00:57:07,364
<i > Pandy had a perfect relationship.</i>

760
00:57:07,656 --> 00:57:12,494
<i > AND one day, the boy to who belonged
he/she left it thrown in the street.</i>

761
00:57:13,087 --> 00:57:14,847
He had been replaced...

762
00:57:15,156 --> 00:57:17,466
by Colin Farrel.

763
00:57:25,258 --> 00:57:26,384
Jesús! Hello!

764
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:30,197
You go to my room,
I will be there in one minute.

765
00:57:30,198 --> 00:57:31,062
Who is she?

766
00:57:31,097 --> 00:57:33,725
First we will have
a conversation.

767
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:42,400
Grandmother, do allow me to explain to you something, this well?

768
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:43,401
You look at me, you look at me.

769
00:57:44,611 --> 00:57:48,782
Not this well to open the door
being without clothes, in fact...

770
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:53,328
it is not well, to make anything that it includes
to other people when these without clothes.

771
00:57:53,495 --> 00:57:55,789
I am using a sweater.

772
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,341
Listen to me!

773
00:57:57,449 --> 00:58:00,400
Which is your problem? I am taking care
your best interests here.

774
00:58:00,401 --> 00:58:04,500
Now, if you don't want to give the impression
that you are completely crazy...

775
00:58:04,501 --> 00:58:07,108
did you listen my advice, well?

776
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:10,254
Put on pants.

777
00:58:10,629 --> 00:58:12,298
Put on pants.

778
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,102
Let us never speak of that.

779
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:18,146
Fact.

780
00:58:21,358 --> 00:58:22,317
As this your mom?

781
00:58:23,151 --> 00:58:24,236
This well.

782
00:58:24,945 --> 00:58:28,031
He/she had their first
chemotherapy yesterday, so...

783
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,408
something is bad.

784
00:58:32,327 --> 00:58:33,578
You could visit her.

785
00:58:35,914 --> 00:58:40,544
She didn't say exactly that him
it would like that, so maybe...

786
00:58:40,553 --> 00:58:42,179
If, it is a little tired.

787
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,142
It is good to see you.

788
00:58:48,462 --> 00:58:51,757
I came until here,
because I am with a problem.

789
00:58:51,965 --> 00:58:56,345
That night I felt that I have
with you a great connection.

790
00:58:56,887 --> 00:58:58,430
And maybe you can...

791
00:58:58,764 --> 00:59:00,265
If. Tell me...

792
00:59:06,188 --> 00:59:08,690
This will sound...

793
00:59:08,899 --> 00:59:10,275
Good, what is.

794
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:16,240
Seemingly Gabe, he/she could not wait
to that found the anger to kiss him...

795
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:19,910
then the one decided to kiss
to my best friend.

796
00:59:20,219 --> 00:59:23,514
It has been awful in the school...

797
00:59:24,098 --> 00:59:28,686
I refer to drama... many looks
stealthy in the parking lot.

798
00:59:29,312 --> 00:59:30,910
Anyway,
there is a party tonight...

799
00:59:31,511 --> 00:59:33,846
and it was supposed
that he/she would go with him, and now...

800
00:59:34,817 --> 00:59:37,153
I mean,
I have not spoken with the one.

801
00:59:37,528 --> 00:59:38,529
You should go.

802
00:59:38,821 --> 00:59:40,860
- Seriously?
- Yes, you should go.

803
00:59:40,901 --> 00:59:43,584
To be grandiose,
to be kind with all...

804
00:59:43,585 --> 00:59:46,621
to pass it well, if you make that
you will be a rock star.

805
00:59:47,231 --> 00:59:48,232
They come with me.

806
00:59:49,316 --> 00:59:50,818
Not I am clever for that.

807
00:59:51,068 --> 00:59:55,948
Seriously, if I enter with you? Your you are bigger,
intelligent, mysterious...

808
00:59:56,574 --> 00:59:57,866
If, I am mysterious.

809
00:59:58,784 --> 01:00:02,715
Flattering you am totally,
that is to say... we go.

810
01:00:02,716 --> 01:00:08,065
It would be grandiose and I will owe it to you...

811
01:00:08,066 --> 01:00:09,866
for always.

812
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:25,537
This is similar to a dream that I had, but
it was naked, but with my slippers.

813
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:26,538
Ladies and gentlemen...

814
01:00:29,014 --> 01:00:29,889
incredible and beautiful Lucy Hardwick.

815
01:00:30,181 --> 01:00:33,935
That it is dressing designer's dress,
and accompanied by this type.

816
01:00:36,176 --> 01:00:37,964
- Hey, like you are?
- Howard Porchnik.

817
01:00:39,276 --> 01:00:41,564
- Pardon, like your name is?
- Howard Porchnik.

818
01:00:41,876 --> 01:00:41,564
Porchnik.

819
01:00:42,076 --> 01:00:44,464
- Porchnik? And your father?
- Rodney Porchnik.

820
01:00:45,076 --> 01:00:49,064
- Is your father here?
- This in Bermuda shorts, but he/she would not make the party.

821
01:00:53,057 --> 01:00:53,891
That that was?

822
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:57,770
A million years ago
my mom liked her papa.

823
01:00:57,894 --> 01:01:01,396
You have left that so well.

824
01:01:02,524 --> 01:01:03,650
And are you?

825
01:01:04,526 --> 01:01:08,413
I am their best friend. Do I know them?

826
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:12,967
My God, Madison is here.

827
01:01:12,968 --> 01:01:15,498
We go, there is so much
that I have to tell you.

828
01:01:18,124 --> 01:01:19,892
This well, walks.

829
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:20,891
Sure?

830
01:01:20,926 --> 01:01:23,053
Sure, I will give a turn.

831
01:01:33,047 --> 01:01:34,549
Hey, these here.

832
01:01:35,383 --> 01:01:37,260
I love parties.

833
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:40,054
As these?

834
01:01:40,304 --> 01:01:42,464
Well, very well.

835
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:44,100
That good.

836
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:50,235
If you need to speak with somebody or alone...

837
01:01:51,836 --> 01:01:54,464
not you, here I am when you want.

838
01:01:54,569 --> 01:01:55,778
We go for drinks.

839
01:01:56,028 --> 01:01:57,071
That type is so pretty...

840
01:01:58,865 --> 01:02:00,700
and amusing.

841
01:02:23,024 --> 01:02:25,651
This type is a complete imbecile.

842
01:02:27,752 --> 01:02:29,450
He/she could have been the son of an imbecile.

843
01:02:35,036 --> 01:02:37,580
Mama, you won't believe
what I am seeing right now.

844
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:42,752
Crankcase, I am Sofia.
These there?

845
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:45,948
If, hello. As these?

846
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,745
God, I miss you.

847
01:02:48,746 --> 01:02:52,936
They have passed so many things
that I don't know for where to begin.

848
01:02:53,581 --> 01:02:57,251
Alone I sit down that all my life
he/she is falling to pieces.

849
01:02:57,502 --> 01:02:59,771
I cry the whole time
and you are the only person...

850
01:02:59,772 --> 01:03:01,881
with the one that I can speak
when I sit down this way.

851
01:03:02,673 --> 01:03:04,435
My best friend.

852
01:03:05,636 --> 01:03:06,736
As these?

853
01:03:10,007 --> 01:03:11,008
Crankcase?

854
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:14,470
You are your the pathetic maricón
that he/she enters with Lucy?

855
01:03:15,971 --> 01:03:18,255
I will have to call you later.

856
01:03:25,564 --> 01:03:31,356
You believe that you can come to my neighborhood,
to take you to my girl, to speak with my friends...

857
01:03:31,357 --> 01:03:33,675
without having consequences?

858
01:03:34,365 --> 01:03:35,407
That?

859
01:03:35,741 --> 01:03:38,244
Are you deaf, stupid?

860
01:03:38,336 --> 01:03:43,202
Already listen to you, I believe that the
answer to your question...

861
01:03:43,203 --> 01:03:47,303
it is if you have some deficiency
to learn.

862
01:03:48,054 --> 01:03:51,140
Or alone you are an idiot average?

863
01:03:58,481 --> 01:04:02,151
Of agreement, an idiot
above the average.

864
01:04:02,201 --> 01:04:04,078
What do you say maricón?

865
01:04:08,666 --> 01:04:10,543
- That devils?
- That type is a good one my friend.

866
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:12,170
You are a complete imbecile.

867
01:04:12,587 --> 01:04:13,463
No, I am not it.

868
01:04:13,713 --> 01:04:15,933
I believe that all know...

869
01:04:15,934 --> 01:04:18,551
that I am not the imbecile
in this situation.

870
01:04:19,051 --> 01:04:21,137
- Your these mistaken one.
Be quiet.

871
01:04:21,721 --> 01:04:25,683
Not mine, not of this type,
which is their name. She is grandiose.

872
01:04:25,684 --> 01:04:26,684
It is beautiful...

873
01:04:27,685 --> 01:04:30,685
intelligent and incredible.

874
01:04:30,721 --> 01:04:32,182
And you ruined him.

875
01:04:32,249 --> 01:04:34,493
That it passes with you?
That it passes me?

876
01:04:34,952 --> 01:04:37,020
How could I allow you to manage my car?

877
01:05:04,432 --> 01:05:09,431
You know that it is the first time in
my life that you/they have hit me?

878
01:05:09,446 --> 01:05:10,864
As he/she feels?

879
01:05:10,889 --> 01:05:12,141
It hurts.

880
01:05:12,483 --> 01:05:14,444
Not I am a fan.

881
01:05:16,404 --> 01:05:18,724
He/she should tell you something.

882
01:05:19,425 --> 01:05:23,886
Or rather to speak
in this respect, aloud.

883
01:05:24,912 --> 01:05:26,914
Well.

884
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:30,627
Something happened when he/she had eleven.

885
01:05:31,586 --> 01:05:34,220
He/she had this friend, Ethan.

886
01:05:34,321 --> 01:05:36,421
We made together of all.

887
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:41,320
Not it is strange to be a boy's friend
when you have eleven.

888
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:46,570
I went to their house one day.

889
01:05:47,371 --> 01:05:49,759
And we were making...

890
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,523
games, boys' things...

891
01:05:52,524 --> 01:05:54,524
not him you.

892
01:05:56,521 --> 01:06:00,525
Not I believe that their parents
they were at home.

893
01:06:00,526 --> 01:06:02,926
It was as the game truth or challenge.

894
01:06:02,927 --> 01:06:06,256
As any game.

895
01:06:06,823 --> 01:06:10,827
We take out ourselves some garments,
I am not even sure...

896
01:06:10,828 --> 01:06:13,800
that...

897
01:06:14,664 --> 01:06:16,082
It is well.

898
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:20,160
I got scared, and the he/she got scared...

899
01:06:20,161 --> 01:06:22,983
he/she started to the defensive
saying that...

900
01:06:22,984 --> 01:06:26,240
it was my blame that there are
arrived so far.

901
01:06:26,369 --> 01:06:29,205
And he should have told it to him
in the school because...

902
01:06:29,206 --> 01:06:31,006
everybody...

903
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:35,861
It was so humiliating.

904
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:38,880
The professors came to see me...

905
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:42,930
Lucy, Lucy, that type of things
the whole time passes.

906
01:06:42,931 --> 01:06:47,000
Seriously. That happens. Not it is so
important.

907
01:06:47,001 --> 01:06:50,740
- One eats you feel.
- Then my he/she suckles and me...

908
01:06:50,838 --> 01:06:54,653
we, never speak
on that.

909
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:59,395
It seemed always that
he/she gave him/her venguenza.

910
01:07:01,106 --> 01:07:04,234
That it was like a pervert.

911
01:07:04,692 --> 01:07:06,903
Not you are a pervert,
you didn't make anything bad.

912
01:07:06,904 --> 01:07:09,210
Then, why he/she made me
to feel in that way?

913
01:07:09,406 --> 01:07:11,755
You should stop your mom to accuse.

914
01:07:12,052 --> 01:07:13,610
You should allow it to go.

915
01:07:13,611 --> 01:07:17,270
She was not there when the
did he/she need, why would I should...?

916
01:07:17,271 --> 01:07:19,099
Because he/she can die.

917
01:07:21,253 --> 01:07:24,256
I sit down it, I should not say it.

918
01:07:33,223 --> 01:07:35,953
You know the difficult thing that it was
for my...

919
01:07:35,954 --> 01:07:38,667
to say that. If you are about getting scared...

920
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:41,381
- Congratulations.
- Treatment that you wake up.

921
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:45,152
The world there out is confused...

922
01:07:45,153 --> 01:07:48,690
and it scares and it is never
as you wait for it.

923
01:07:48,772 --> 01:07:50,300
This well...

924
01:07:50,301 --> 01:07:54,301
to be afraid, but you cannot leave that 
those feelings transform you into idiot.

925
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:56,732
Not when it is about people that
he/she really loves you.

926
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:59,233
People that needs you.

927
01:08:03,203 --> 01:08:05,798
Do I suppose that we finish, certain?

928
01:08:06,507 --> 01:08:08,801
If. We finish.

929
01:08:29,255 --> 01:08:32,926
Not I can... this should not happen.

930
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,000
Don't come closer but...

931
01:09:34,001 --> 01:09:35,001
Please.

932
01:09:39,644 --> 01:09:42,439
He/she only wanted to know
if you are well.

933
01:09:43,731 --> 01:09:45,525
Everything hurts.

934
01:09:53,417 --> 01:09:56,962
It is my blame him you,
I am responsible.

935
01:09:58,839 --> 01:10:01,523
But you should listen this Crankcase.

936
01:10:01,524 --> 01:10:04,998
Never but you will play my daughter.

937
01:10:05,179 --> 01:10:08,473
- Not you can see it
- He/she waits, I sit down it.

938
01:10:08,682 --> 01:10:10,559
You have to leave.

939
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,300
<i > Sarah.</i>

940
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,668
That it passes with you?

941
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,503
Him you.

942
01:11:56,212 --> 01:11:58,881
If you don't want to speak with me, well.

943
01:11:58,916 --> 01:12:03,400
But don't send to Phillys
with excuses saying that not these...

944
01:12:03,401 --> 01:12:07,222
Where you could be, I am the only one
person that you know here.

945
01:12:08,096 --> 01:12:11,144
- Certain?
- A lot.

946
01:12:11,445 --> 01:12:15,144
One week has passed...
five days...

947
01:12:15,148 --> 01:12:18,452
and he/she wanted to call you
to the cellular one and...

948
01:12:20,662 --> 01:12:24,357
but I thought that perhaps you were
annoying with me.

949
01:12:24,392 --> 01:12:28,052
He/she listens, I am not angry with you.

950
01:12:28,962 --> 01:12:30,631
If you speak seriously you kiss me.

951
01:12:33,168 --> 01:12:36,671
Lucy, I am not able to,
I cannot see you more.

952
01:12:44,471 --> 01:12:47,265
Not I am the boy.

953
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:50,852
Good, I will discover who is it.

954
01:12:52,094 --> 01:12:57,238
In fact, if you think it,
you will realize that you already know it.

955
01:13:16,421 --> 01:13:17,714
Mom.

956
01:13:20,717 --> 01:13:22,719
I don't feel well.

957
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,095
I believe that I need...

958
01:13:32,154 --> 01:13:33,488
<i > Clinic of Sr. Hardwicke < /i>

959
01:13:33,989 --> 01:13:35,741
I am Lucy, I need
to speak with my papa.

960
01:13:36,199 --> 01:13:38,076
<i > Lucy, him not this here, came out to...</i>

961
01:13:41,163 --> 01:13:45,167
Mom, will I try to get up, well?

962
01:13:45,168 --> 01:13:46,168
I will take you to the hospital,
but you have to help me.

963
01:13:46,234 --> 01:13:47,778
Not I can get up alone.

964
01:13:47,853 --> 01:13:48,979
Does it list?

965
01:13:53,926 --> 01:13:57,100
He/she has what we call
intermittent fever.

966
01:13:57,101 --> 01:14:00,930
Your count of leukocytes lowered a lot,
their body cannot defend.

967
01:14:01,517 --> 01:14:06,345
But speak with half Hardvard,
and they will give you a new drug call...

968
01:14:10,902 --> 01:14:14,447
I sit down it a lot... it was not.
What step?

969
01:14:14,906 --> 01:14:16,908
Do I go for a soda, do you want something?

970
01:14:17,325 --> 01:14:18,785
No, I am well.

971
01:15:09,121 --> 01:15:09,914
Hello?

972
01:15:10,497 --> 01:15:13,626
Hello Sofia, I am me.

973
01:15:14,627 --> 01:15:16,045
Who?

974
01:15:16,629 --> 01:15:18,297
Crankcase.

975
01:15:18,422 --> 01:15:19,340
Who?

976
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:21,008
Crankcase!

977
01:15:22,092 --> 01:15:26,096
- Crankcase Webb.
- Crankcase! Lover!

978
01:15:26,097 --> 01:15:29,515
<i > This it is not a good moment.</i>

979
01:15:30,444 --> 01:15:36,085
<i > he/she Listens, I am in Soho, and everybody
it is drunk, and me also.</i>

980
01:15:36,786 --> 01:15:39,051
<i > is the party of new year, do you know?</i>

981
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:41,705
Not it is new year, it is October.

982
01:15:42,164 --> 01:15:45,000
<i > Good, it seems as new year,
he/she listens affection...</i>

983
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:51,672
<i > I Really want to speak with you,
it is about calling myself but late. Of agreement?</i>

984
01:15:52,841 --> 01:15:56,845
If, this well. It is alone that...

985
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:00,900
Hello?

986
01:16:12,271 --> 01:16:14,398
What does it happen to you?

987
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:19,699
Not I am able to be.

988
01:16:20,821 --> 01:16:26,645
I am 26 years old, I am healthy,
I am capable, I have many opportunities.

989
01:16:26,812 --> 01:16:32,374
My friends are marrying, having
children and I are so far from that.

990
01:16:32,484 --> 01:16:34,319
Did reason come here?

991
01:16:35,028 --> 01:16:37,572
To be about understanding
that it passes with my life.

992
01:16:37,906 --> 01:16:40,242
From when you attempt it?

993
01:16:41,326 --> 01:16:43,620
Good, eleven years ago, I believe.

994
01:16:43,621 --> 01:16:44,461
A lot of time.

995
01:16:44,496 --> 01:16:46,873
You have not made an effort enough.

996
01:16:47,457 --> 01:16:49,751
Perhaps you should think
in working of another thing.

997
01:16:50,252 --> 01:16:51,152
If, it could be...

998
01:16:52,838 --> 01:16:58,342
Not him you, I have this idea that
something will come and my life changed.

999
01:16:58,844 --> 01:17:00,429
It was mistaken.

1000
01:17:00,505 --> 01:17:05,167
Crankcase, I am 133 years old.

1001
01:17:05,168 --> 01:17:08,116
Grandmother, that is impossible.

1002
01:17:08,117 --> 01:17:13,170
Pass all my life
being about discovering something.

1003
01:17:13,205 --> 01:17:15,854
And do you know what?

1004
01:17:15,855 --> 01:17:17,055
Not he/she goes well.

1005
01:17:20,558 --> 01:17:22,351
I cannot say anything.

1006
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:26,480
I will be died soon
and your will still continue I live.

1007
01:17:26,856 --> 01:17:29,984
So he/she stops to complain.

1008
01:17:38,977 --> 01:17:40,103
Hello.

1009
01:17:41,605 --> 01:17:43,315
Did they leave?

1010
01:17:44,107 --> 01:17:48,070
Paige was sleeping,
he/she wanted to stay but...

1011
01:17:48,071 --> 01:17:50,471
he/she wanted to be alone.

1012
01:17:50,989 --> 01:17:52,616
This well.

1013
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:55,178
We should converse.

1014
01:18:13,405 --> 01:18:16,116
Not I am sure for where to begin.

1015
01:18:17,826 --> 01:18:22,221
You can begin saying me why
are angry conmingo?

1016
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,801
It was very hard...

1017
01:18:29,002 --> 01:18:31,204
there am...

1018
01:18:31,205 --> 01:18:34,305
I felt alone therefore time that...

1019
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:38,960
I believe that it accuses you
for almost for everything.

1020
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:53,180
You know, they said that this week,
it will be the it finishes that I will make the quimio.

1021
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,390
They say that the operation was a success...

1022
01:18:58,391 --> 01:19:01,003
and that they didn't see
any cancerigenic cell.

1023
01:19:01,004 --> 01:19:04,250
So all the what an one is happening now,
it is alone serguros to be.

1024
01:19:08,612 --> 01:19:10,697
But you that everything will be well.

1025
01:19:12,116 --> 01:19:14,024
He was not before.

1026
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,366
He/she was very afraid.

1027
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:28,867
Not I want to lose the part
where finally it is able to know you.

1028
01:19:35,556 --> 01:19:39,560
Not I know that it can happen later,
I don't know it...

1029
01:19:39,895 --> 01:19:41,844
But I will continue loving you.

1030
01:19:41,845 --> 01:19:44,610
Waiting that you
you can also love me.

1031
01:19:45,693 --> 01:19:48,904
I made errors, sure.

1032
01:19:48,905 --> 01:19:51,500
But I will always be there
for you.

1033
01:19:56,379 --> 01:20:00,341
Alone there is a thing that
I want that make for me.

1034
01:20:00,675 --> 01:20:02,093
What?

1035
01:20:06,389 --> 01:20:09,850
You have to stop to smoke.

1036
01:20:10,476 --> 01:20:11,943
This well.

1037
01:20:11,978 --> 01:20:13,987
- This well?
- I will make it.

1038
01:20:17,117 --> 01:20:19,995
Dumiendo, má should be.

1039
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,352
<i > Dear Sarah.</i>

1040
01:20:56,653 --> 01:20:59,460

1048
01:21:20,291 --> 01:21:22,069
<i > being about acting 
as a boy...</i>

1049
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:23,215
without responsibilities.

1050
01:21:23,216 --> 01:21:26,000
<i > AND I never got it,
because escaping was always.</i>

1052
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:32,462

to think that anything is impossible.</i>

1053

1059
01:22:04,137 --> 01:22:06,500
<i > I sit down for everything, 
but more I sit down it...</i>

1060
01:22:06,601 --> 01:22:07,938
<i > for not having had

1063
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:17,460
<i > AND without caring that I continue looking for 
the appropriate words...
</i>

1064
01:22:17,461 --> 01:22:21,263
<i > all that wanted to tell you 
it is "Thank you."</i>

1065
01:23:05,959 --> 01:23:07,503
Grandmother?

1066
01:23:08,337 --> 01:23:09,671
Grandmother?

1067
01:23:09,739 --> 01:23:13,743
Chekea some of my books of children, 
brought from Los Angeles, he/she calls himself Pandy.


1068
01:23:13,744 --> 01:23:16,044
On an adorable bear
that it is indestructible.

1069
01:23:16,354 --> 01:23:18,356
Perhaps it doesn't please you 
because he/she doesn't have drawings, and you...

1070
01:23:20,976 --> 01:23:22,144
Grandmother?

1071
01:23:22,946 --> 01:23:25,939
Phyllis! Grandmother, awake.

1072
01:23:28,066 --> 01:23:29,609
Grandmother?

1073
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:56,950
Grandmother.

1074
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,600
<i > Mortuary to call in any
moment at 248-182-971 < /i>

1075
01:26:16,132 --> 01:26:18,326
You wrote me a letter.

1076
01:26:24,541 --> 01:26:28,503
It is very cold here.

1077
01:26:28,704 --> 01:26:31,700
Seriously, I had forgotten that,
this is ridiculous.

1078
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:35,960
I was surprised it.

1079
01:26:39,098 --> 01:26:41,893
I will miss you a little.

1080
01:26:43,144 --> 01:26:44,896
That good.

1081
01:26:49,066 --> 01:26:52,236
Perhaps do want to walk or something?

1082
01:26:55,757 --> 01:26:59,761
Not I can, I have to return inside.

1083
01:27:03,348 --> 01:27:04,682
This well.

1084
01:27:05,183 --> 01:27:07,477
I see you somewhere around.

1085
01:27:15,093 --> 01:27:17,054
Good-bye, Sarah!

1086
01:27:19,132 --> 01:27:20,675
He/she waits.

1087
01:27:22,009 --> 01:27:24,220
Not you will say the last word.

1088
01:27:26,389 --> 01:27:27,974
Of anything.

1089
01:27:47,436 --> 01:27:48,854
Blocked?

1090
01:27:50,022 --> 01:27:51,649
If, I suppose that if.

1091
01:27:52,024 --> 01:27:53,192
It was so close.

1092
01:27:53,525 --> 01:27:55,027
Of what?

1093
01:27:55,319 --> 01:27:57,029
Of finishing.

1094
01:27:57,129 --> 01:27:58,548
That it happened?

1095
01:27:59,258 --> 01:28:03,220
I sit down that he lacks something.


1096
01:28:03,621 --> 01:28:05,200
Some idea?

1097
01:28:05,264 --> 01:28:07,224
About what is it?

1098
01:28:07,849 --> 01:28:10,018
My grandmother, died.

1099
01:28:11,019 --> 01:28:12,813
Do I sit down it, was it pleasant?

1100
01:28:13,146 --> 01:28:14,606
If, very pleasant.

1101
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:16,108
Did a lot of time pass with her?

1102
01:28:16,441 --> 01:28:17,651
Near the end.

1103
01:28:18,193 --> 01:28:19,778
That is good.

1104
01:28:20,612 --> 01:28:23,156
It is pretty that you write of her.

1105
01:28:24,993 --> 01:28:26,786
No, I don't have any idea...


1106
01:28:27,161 --> 01:28:28,580
I am so disappointed.

1107
01:28:28,581 --> 01:28:31,271
It had been grandiose if leave...

1108
01:28:31,272 --> 01:28:34,485
he/she gave you that incredible idea 
and simplemte left.

1109
01:28:34,494 --> 01:28:36,754
Any waiter had made it.

1110
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:38,673
Do I sit down it, can I stuff it?

1111
01:28:40,717 --> 01:28:42,176
I Am Crankcase.

1112
01:28:42,677 --> 01:28:45,471
Janey, a pleasure to know you.

1113
01:28:46,799 --> 01:28:49,100
If not these very busy one...

1114
01:28:49,101 --> 01:28:51,710
perhaps you can see 
in what I am working.

1115
01:28:52,679 --> 01:28:55,891
It is a draft, but I want
the opinion of other eyes.

1116
01:28:56,308 --> 01:29:00,270
Ok, but I tell you, 
I am very bad criticizing.

1117
01:29:00,396 --> 01:29:01,605
Grandiose.
