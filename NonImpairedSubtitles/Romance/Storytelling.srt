1
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,760
Storytelling

2
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,760
"Fiction"

3
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,800
Hey, you wanna hear
my short story now?

4
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,640
I can read it to you.

5
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,820
You mean, again?

6
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,720
Well, I changed 
the ending a little.

7
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,760
Oh. What happens now?

8
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,640
Well...actually
it’s the same...

9
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,640
...but longer.
I think it’s better.

10
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,760
More...raw.

11
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,640
Well then maybe you should
just read the ending?

12
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,760
But it won’t make any sense
if you hear it out of context.

13
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,760
I think you should leave it 
the way it was. It was good.

14
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,760
So you don’t want to 
hear my new ending?

15
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,760
You’ll read it in class tomorrow.
Surprise me.

16
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Anyway... I have to go. I promised
Melinda I’d help her with her oral.

17
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,920
You are tired of me.
I can tell.

18
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,720
Marcus, I’m tired.
That’s all.

19
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,700
You’ve lost interest.

20
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,640
You hardly even sweat 
anymore when we have sex.

21
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,640
I was never much of a sweater.
You know that.

22
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,760
Look, Vi. I don’t blame you.
You feel pity now.

23
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,760
The pleasure isn’t
there any more.

24
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,760
The kinkiness has gone.

25
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,760
You’ve become kind.

26
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
"But when he saw her...

27
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,720
...it was as if he could walk
like a normal person.

28
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,640
His legs didn’t swing...

29
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,720
...his arms didn’t spaz away.

30
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,640
He wasn’t a freak anymore...

31
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,720
...for she made him forget
his affliction.

32
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,720
No more cerebral palsy!

33
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,640
From now on she "CP" stood for...

34
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,760
...Cerebral Person.

35
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,760
He was a Cerebral Person.

36
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,680
I thought it was
really good, Marcus.

37

00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,680
Really moving and emotional.

38
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,720
Yeah, I thought it was
really emotional, too.

39
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,720
And I mean, really
good word choices.

40
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,640
It kind of reminded me
a little of Faulkner...

41
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,720
...but East Coast and disabled.

42
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,640
Or Flannery O'Connor.
She had multiple sclerosis.

43
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,720
And Borges.
He was blind.

44
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,720
Updike has psoriasis.

45
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,640
Uhm...Maybe I’m wrong...

46
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,640
...but, um,
I’m afraid I found

47
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,640
the whole thing to be a little trite.

48
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,460
It’s earnestness is...

49
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,980
...well...
it’s a little embarrassing.

50
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,680
And those adjectives, are a little
flatfooted. And redundant.

51
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,680
I’m sorry...
I mean...

52
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,680
Anyway, don’t.

53
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,280
What do I know?
Don’t even listen to what I say.

54
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,760
I mean...

55
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,720
Anyone else?

56
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,720
Catherine is right.

57
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,720
The story is a piece of shit.

58
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,640
You express nothing but
banalities, and formally

59
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,640
speaking, are unable to construct
a single compelling sentence.

60
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,640
You ride on a wave of clichés

61
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,640
so worn in fact, it actually
approaches a level of grotesquerie.

62
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,720
And your subtitle,
"The rawness of truth".

63
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,760
Is that supposed to be
a joke of some sort?

64
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,760
Or are you just being pretentious?

65
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,760
Okay.

66
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,760
Who’s next?

67
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,600
Marcus, wait up!

68
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,600
What do you want?

69
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,600
- Don’t be so upset. It’s okay.
- What the fuck are you talking about?
What´s ok?

70
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,720
- You know he hated my story also.
- Your story was terrible.

71
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,600
- Marcus! You´ll write something better next time. 
- Patronizing fuck!

72
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,640
If you just had been honest with me
in the first place, I wouldn’t have read it!

73
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,640
I knew it was shit, but - idiot! -
I believed you.

74
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,990
That’s not fair. I was honest! Just because I 
wasn’t sucking up like that bitch Catherine.

75
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,920
Well I sure didn’t hear you voice 
your opinion in there when it mattered!

76
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,640
I admit it.
I was scared.

77
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,640
I was shocked, in fact

78
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,640
by what he said. And he’s
so... convincing.

79
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,640
I’m sorry if I let you down,
but really...

80
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,640
I still say he’s just one opinion.
I don’t even like 

81
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,640
his books that much.
They’re all so... aggressively

82
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,760
confrontational. 
I don’t care if he´s won the Pulitzer Prize.

83
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,600
You just wanna fuck him!

84
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,680
Like Catherine and every other
white cunt on campus.

85
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,600
Marcus, you can’t just unilaterally
decide to end things.

86
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,920
This is a relationship we’re talking about!
A friendship! You don’t just...

87
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,720
Fuck you!

88
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,720
Fuck him! Fuck him! Fuck him...

89
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,640
Vi?
Are you okay?

90
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,720
Yes. I’m okay.
I’m totally okay.

91
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
You did the right thing.

92
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,760
I know that.

93
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Fucking cripple.

94
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,720
Why do I waste my time with undergrads?
They are all so...

95
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,760
...juvenile.

96
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,640
Uch! I just thought Marcus 
would be different. I mean...

97
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,760
...he´s got CP!

98
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,060
What are you gonna do now?

99
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,680
I don´t know-- go to a bar--
get laid, whatever.

100
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,760
Don´t worry about me.
I´ll be just fine.

101
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,800
- What can I get you?
- Just have a beer.

102
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,800
Here you go.

103
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Hi.

104
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,800
Hello, Vi.

105
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,800
What are you doing here?

106
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,800
What are you doing here?

107
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,680
I´m sorry. 
I didn´t mean...

108
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,800
I didn´t expect to run into you here,
that´s all.

109
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Well...

110
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
...now you have.

111
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,760
Uhm...
Then, are you alone?

112
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,760
Can I join you?

113
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,760
Gee, thanks.

114
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,760
Well, uhm... I just wanted to say that 
I´m really happy with the class...and uhm...

115
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,680
I know you must hear this all the time,
but i´m also a great admirer of

116
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,680
your work.
"A Sunday Lynching", especially...

117
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,800
...really, uhm...

118
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,720
spoke to me.

119
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,720
God, I hope I´m not emberassing.

120
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,760
You´re not.

121
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,640
Good.

122
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,640
´Cause I am... I really 
agreed with everything...

123
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,760
you had to say last week about
how bad my story was.

124
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,640
That´s good.

125
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,680
And I also agreed with what you
said today about Marcus´s story.

126
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,760
It is a piece of shit.

127
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,760
You have beautiful skin.

128
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,760
Thank you.

129
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,760
So Catherine seems like she might
become a really good writer.

130
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,800
Maybe.

131
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,720
She´s okay.

132
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,720
Aren´t you going out with Catherine?

133
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,720
I´m sorry. It´s none of my business.
I didn´t mean...

134
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,760
I´m not 'going out' with Catherine.

135
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,760
Do you think I have
potential as a writer?

136
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,760
No.

137
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,760
Thank you for being honest.

138
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,800
I have so much respect for you.

139
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,760
Can I just freshen up for a second?

140
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,680
It´s over there.

141
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,760
Thanks.

142
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,760
Don´t be a racist.

143
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,760
Don´t be a racist. Don´t be a racist.
Don´t be a racist...

144
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,720
It´s a really nice place you have.

145
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,720
Is the rent high?

146
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,720
Take off your top.

147
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,720
Now...

148
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,720
...take off the rest.

149
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,720
Turn around.

150
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,720
Bend over.

151
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,760
Say...

152 
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,760
...'nigger, fuck me'.

153
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,680
Oh... bu...uh... I can´t say that.

154
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,680
Say...

155
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,760
...'nigger.'

156
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,680
- Say, 'nigger.'
- Nigger.

157
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,680
'Fuck me hard!'

158
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,680
Fuck... Me... Hard!

159
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,680
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!' 

160
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,680
Nigger... Fuck... Me... Hard!

161
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,880
Again!

162
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,680
Nigger... Fuck... Me... Hard!

163
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,800
- Again!
- Nigger... Fuck... Me... Hard!

164
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,760
Freak.

165
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Can I come in?

166
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,400
You´re all...

167
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,960
...sweaty.

168
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,760
"So John flipped her around
and slammed her against the wall.

169
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,760
Jane braced herself.

170
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,760
She thought about her mother.
She thought about Peter.

171
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,760
She thought about God... 
and rape.

172
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,680
Say 'Fuck me, nigger!
Fuck me hard!'

173
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,760
John´s flesh abraded her soft skin.

174
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,680
There would be marks.

175
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,680
She acquiesced, and said
what he asked her to say...

176
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,800
...and did what he asked her to do.

177
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,760
She had entered college with hope,
with dignity...

178
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,800
...but she would graduate as a whore.

179
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,640
Why do people have to be so ugly?

180
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,640
Write about such ugly characters.
It´s perverted.

181
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,640
I know you all think 
that I´m being prissy...

182
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,760
...but I don´t care! I was brought up
in a certain way. And this is...

183
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,760
... mean-spirited.

184
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,760
It did seem a little...

185
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,640
...affected.

186
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,680
Like by using taboo language
you were trying to

187
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,760
shock us about the hollowness
of your characters.

188
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,760
I think it was a
little bit racist.

189
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,680
It was completely racist...

190
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,980
...and beyond that I felt
deply offended as a woman.

191
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:54,000
As if women could only operate
from experiences of objectification.

192
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,780
Totally phallocentric.

193
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,880
And so weirdly misogynistic.

194
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,680
I mean, why does Jane
go through with this?

195
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,640
Is she stupid?

196
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,920
Hey, but... wasn´t this a rape?

197
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,640
Or, did I miss something? Because...
I´m confused. Because if this was a rape

198
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,920
then... why would she be a whore?

199
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,640
It was confessional, yet dishonest.

200
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,640
Jane pretends to be

201
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,640
horrified by the sexuality
that she in fact fetishizes.

202
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,640
She subsumes herself to the
myth of black male sexual potency.

203
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,640
But then doesn´t follow through.

204
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,640
She think she respects afroamericans

205
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,840
and thinks they´re cool and exotic.

206
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,680
What a notch he´d make in her belt.

207
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,900
But of course it all comes
down to Mandingo cliché.

208
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,780
And he calls her on it.

209
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,680
In classic racist tradition she

210
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,680
demonizes, then runs for cover.

211
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,680
But then, how could she
behave otherwise?

212
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,680
She´s just a spoiled 
suburban white girl

213
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,800
with a Benneton rainbow complex.

214
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,600
It´s just my opinion.
And what do I know?

215
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,920
But I think it´s a callow
piece of writing.

216
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,720
Callow and coy.

217
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,640
Jane wants more but isn´t
honest enough to admit it.

218
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,640
In the end, she returns to 
the safety of her crippled...

219
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,640
..translation: sexually impotent...
boyfriend.

220
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,640
This is bullshit!
Her story was the truth!

221
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,840
- Right.
- It´s unbelievable!

222
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,240
- It´s clichéd.
- It´s disguisting!

223
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,760
But it happened!

224
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,640
I don´t know about what happened, Vi...

225
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,680
...because once you start writing
it all becomes fiction.

226
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,680
Still...

227
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,760
...it certainly is a impovement
over your last story:

228
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,680
There is now at least
a beginning...

229
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,680
...a middle...

230
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,760
...and an end.

231
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,220
"Nonfiction"

232
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,640
Toby, I just know you are
going to become a moviestar.

233
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,640
Please don´t forget me
when you make it to the top.

234
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,720
I will always love you.
Pam.

235
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,840
- Hello?
- Hello. Uhm... is this Pam?

236
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,640
Who is this?

237
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,680
Toby Oxman.

238
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,680
Toby? Oh, hi!
How are you?

239
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,680
Oh, fine.
How are you?

240
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,760
- Great.
- Great!

241
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,600
So what´s going on?

242
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,720
That´s what I was just
gonna ask you.

243
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,720
But...you called.

244
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,720
I was just calling because...

245
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,640
Well...I was wondering if you still...

246
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,720
remembered me, which I guess you do.

247
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,720
Yeah.

248
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,840
So. Look at where we are:
the year 2000!

249
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,640
Can you believe it?

250
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,640
I mean, did you ever think 
we would actually make it?

251
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,720
Um, well, yeah.

252
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,760
So are you still acting?

253
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,760
Oh, no, not any more.

254
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,640
I kind of came to terms with myself

255
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,640
I realized I had done
what I had to do.

256
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,760
And it was time to move on.

257
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,840
Oh. So what did you do 
after you gave up on acting?

258
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,680
Well, I went to law school...

259
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,800
...if you can believe that.

260
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,600
I believe it.

261
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,600
Yeah, well, it was really 
all kind of a joke...

262
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,600
...and a rip-off, the whole 
thing so, uh...so I dropped out.

263
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,600
Oh, that's too bad.

264
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,980
Yeah, well, then it got me 	
writing, so that was a good thing.

265
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,990
Anything I might know about?

266
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,900
Well, um, I kind of let things go 	
on this novel I'd been really into...  

267
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,640
I mean, the whole publishing 	
industry is totally corrupt.

268
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,640
I mean, really, it's finished.

269
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,640
That's too bad.

270
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,640
I worked over at a homeless
shelter for a while...

271
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,720
...drove a cab to pay the rent, but,
I mean, that was like...

272
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,640
I mean, I have some dignity.

273
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,640
That's good. 
So then what do you do now?

274
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,640
I'm a documentary filmmaker.

275
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,640
- Oh? Anything I might have seen?
- N-not yet.

276
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,720
I'm hoping to get a grant for 
this one project on teenagers.

277
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,640
Geez, remember when 
we were teenagers?

278
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,760
Yeah. You didn't wanna 
take me to the prom.

279
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,640
Oh, I don't remember that...

280
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,680
I do.

281
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,970
Well, but it was so long ago.

282
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,720
We were so different back then...

283
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,600
Uh, well, anyway, so 
I'm looking for subjects 

284
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,970
for this documentary on
teenage life in suburbia.

285
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,600
It´s kind of an exploration of 
the psyche of its mythology.

286
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,600
I wrote to Derrida
to see if he'd like to

287
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,720
do the narration. But everything's still 
kind of in development at this point.

288
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,640
I work in a shoe store right now.

289
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,640
But it's cool. 
I'm not ashamed.

290
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,640
I mean, really, I have a much
stronger sense of self now.

291
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,640
And, uh, anyways, it's 
really very temporary.

292
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,720
That's good.

293
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,640
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. 	
What about you? 

294
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,640
I'd heard through the grapevine 
you were producing movies.

295
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,760
Yeah. But not any more.

296
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,760
Oh. Tired of 'life 
in the fast lane'?

297
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,760
So...you're um...

298
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,640
...you're married?

299
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,680
Yeah.

300
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,760
- Huh. Kids?
- Yeah.

301
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,680
- How many?
- Three.

302
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,680
Great.

303
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,680
How old are they?

304
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,760
Eight, six, and four.

305
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,760
Wow, that really is great.

306
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,760
In a few years, who knows, maybe 	
they'll want to be in my documentary!

307
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,490
Listen, Toby, I can't 
really talk right now.

308
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,680
- Do you mind if I call you back?
- Yeah, sure.

309
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,800
- OK. Bye.
- OK. Bye.

310
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,800
Maybe she has caller ID.

311
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,720
FAIRFIELD HIGH SCHOOL

312
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,800
Do you have any hobbies?

313
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,720
No, not really.

314
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,760
Any books you like
to read for fun?

315
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,760
How about those 'underground' comics?

316
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,760
I hate reading.

317
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,680
All right, Scooby, let's 
not beat around the bush.

318
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,760
With your attitude, you're 
not going to get in anywhere.

319
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,680
Okay.

320
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,760
Okay...

321
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,760
So you just don't care.

322
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,680
Let me ask you something, not as your 
guidance counselor, but...as a friend...

323
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,680
...what do you want 
to do with your life?

324
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,800
I mean, what kind of long-term
goals can you possibly have?

325
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,680
- I dunno...
- C'mon.

326
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,800
Talk to me. 
Tell me what you're thinking.

327
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,640
Well...

328
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,760
I mean...
I wanna be on TV.

329
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,040
Maybe have a talk show or something.

330
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,640
Like Conan. Or early Letterman.

331
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,760
Ah-hah. And how is it you
hope to achieve this goal?

332
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,760
I dunno. 
See if I have any connections.

333
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,800
Did you knock on his door?

334
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,680
Yes, but he just shouted
at me and used the f-word.

335
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,800
Scooby!
Dinner!

336
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,680
Would anyone be interested in 
being hypnotized after dinner?

337
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,800
No.

338
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
Let's just start.

339
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,760
I don't know what's 
wrong with that kid.

340
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,640
- Maybe he's gay.
- Don't ever say that.

341
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,640
- What if he is?
- He isn't.

342
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,760
Marty, ignore him.

343
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,760
- He's vegetarian...
- Brady!

344
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,970
- And even if he is...
- Gay people are people too, you know...

345
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,640
You're just being prejudiced.

346
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:37,550
I don't care is he's gay. I'm cool.  I mean, it's 
not like I have to share his room or anything.

347
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,980
I just want to know what the hell he does
in his room that's so interesting he doesn't 
come down for dinner.

348
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,680
Maybe he's building a bomb...

349
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,980
- ...just like...
- Don't even joke about that!

350
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,760
I'm serious!
What happens if he blows up the school?

351
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,680
- I'm going in there.
- Was anyone in my room today?

352
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,800
Is everything OK?

353
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,640
My CD case like totally collapsed.

354
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,720
I'm gonna have to 
recatalogue all weekend.

355
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,720
Hey. Can you pass the salad over.

356
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,640
- Steak's really good tonight.
- Good.

357
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,640
- Got a lot of homework?
- I dunno.

358
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,260
Whaddya mean you don't know? You either 
got a lot or you don't.  What's not to know?

359
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,760
You started filling out your
college applications yet?

360
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,760
I'm not going to college.

361
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,160
- What are you going to do?
- I dunno.

362
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,680
What DO you know?

363
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,190
Dad, I'm trying to figure 
things out right now, OK?

364
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,260
It's like, really hard...

365
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,680
...and I'm just listening to
some old Elton John and...

366
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,680
- Gay.
- Out! Leave the table!

367
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,800
- What?
- You heard me: leave the table!

368
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,720
Man, I am out of here!
This family is so fucked!

369
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,640
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can 
say the f-word and I can't.

370
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,640
Yeah, well, Mikey...

371
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,720
...listen up. 	
Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.

372
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,760
- I'll talk to you later, man!
- Yo, dude!

373
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,760
Consuelo?

374
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,720
Consuelo?

375
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,720
Yes, Mikey.

376
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,720
Do you have any brothers or sisters?

377
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,640
- Yes
- Really?

378
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,720
How many?

379
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,640
Four brothers...

380
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,720
...and five sisters.

381
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,940
Why did your parents
have so many children?

382
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,640
I mean, if they were poor...

383
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,760
... wouldn't it be better
to have just one or two?

384
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,640
It was God's will.

385
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,640
But do you really believe in God?

386
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,060
And heaven, hell and angels
and all kind of stuff?

387
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,760
No.

388
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,640
So?

389
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,920
How was school today?

390
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,640
The same.

391
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,950
The same. 
Same as what?

392
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,720
Just the same.

393
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,360
- We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
- Oh, yeah?

394
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,760
We did the same 
thing last year also.

395
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,640
How was the class?

396
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,640
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for
homework. The movie's like almost four hours.

397
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,640
And then I'm supposed to
write a report on survivors.

398
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,760
You know any survivors, Dad?

399
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,600
Do I know any...

400
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,720
...personally...?

401
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,720
Well, technically your 
Zeda is a survivor.

402
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,600
He was in a concentration camp?

403
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,720
Well, no.
But he had to escape the Nazis.

404
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,800
But I thought he came over 
to America before the war.

405
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,600
Well, he did. With his family. 
But his cousins...

406
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,640
...they had to stay...

407
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,640
and they were all killed. And if he'd 
stayed, he would have been killed.

408
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,640
So in my book he's a survivor.

409
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,640
Even though it was only his 
cousins that were killed?

410
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,640
But that could've happened to him.

411
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,640
Or to me, if I'd been alive.
Or you.

412
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,760
Or me?

413
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,640
You mean, then, we're all survivors?

414
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,640
Well...yes.

415
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,640
If it hadn't been for Hitler...

416
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,640
...he wouldn't have
had to leave Europe.

417
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,760
We would have been...European.

418
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,600
But then, in a sense...

419
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,600
...since you would never have met Dad
if your family had stayed in Europe...

420
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,680
...if it weren't for Hitler, none 
of us would have been born.

421
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,720
Get the hell outta here!

422
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,720
Man, it's just, like, conversation.

423
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,720
Tell me: you make a living at this?

424
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,720
Well, sir...uh...

425
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,720
I'm actually not doing
this for the money.

426
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,640
When you make a documentary,
you do it for many 

427
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,720
reasons, but money is
certainly not one of them.

428
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,990
I don't get it.

429
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,760
Well, sir...

430
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,640
...a lot has happened to
the landscape of the suburban

431
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,640
high school since I was a student...

432
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,640
...and I feel it would be a valuable

433
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,640
...perhaps even enlightening...

434
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:08,640
...endeavor, to chronicle the changes...

435
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,640
to get intimate with the realities...

436
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,760
...kids and parents face in
American schools today.

437
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,760
Yeah, well, whatever.

438
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,760
I'll let you know if there's interest.

439
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,760
Excuse me, where's the bathroom?

440
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,760
- You a pervert?
- No.

441
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,760
Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker.

442
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,760
You mean, like, 
Blair Witch Project?

443
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,760
Well, no.

444
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,680
I'm doing one on high
school students, in fact.

445
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,760
What for?

446
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,760
Well...it's kind of a...

447
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,680
...it's kind of a...

448
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,800
sociological study in the
aftermath of Columbine.


449
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,680
Is this to like get into Sundance?

450
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,800
Yeah, well, it's possible they
would be interested in it.

451
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,800
Doubt it.

452
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,800
Actually, there is some interest
from the Sundance Channel.

453
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,720
Whoopee.

454
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,760
HBO and MTV have also 
shown some interest.

455
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,760
So you have connections...

456
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,640
You see, we're trying to do a film...

457
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,640
...on suburban lifestyles...

458
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,640
...kind of An American Family
for the new millennium...

459
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,680
I thought this was about
kids getting into college.

460
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,780
Oh, it is. I mean...

461
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,760
Which is it? You gotta 
keep your focus straight.

462
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,760
You're absolutely right.

463
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,680
The focus is on the college 
admissions process today.

464
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,680
And you want Scooby to
be the focus of all this?

465
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:47,680
Scooby and a few other students of
different socioeconomic backgrounds.

466
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,680
You didn´t mention any 
other students before.

467
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,680
Oh, well, I don't have them yet,
but...

468
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,680
Either Scooby is the focus,
or forget it.

469
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,680
Yeah, I thought I was the focus.

470
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,800
I wanna be the focus.

471
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,720
Toby, we need this to
be a positive experience.

472
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,190
Well, I suppose I could reconceive...

473
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,640
Reconceive.

474
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,640
'Cause Scooby does have a quality...

475
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,740
...that I've been looking for, a quality 
that is emblematic of America today.

476
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,940
It's part disillusionment,
part hope...

477
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,640
Twinkeys!

478
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,760
Boys, take napkins...
Napkins...

479
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,640
Not to be crass, but...

480
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,680
...what do we get out of this?

481
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,680
Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.

482
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,680
Oh, I know...

483
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,680
...I know that.

484
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,680
Well...

485
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,680
...sharing your story,...

486
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,760
...your ups and downs, and so forth can
I hope, be an illuminating experience.

487
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,760
Yeah... How do we know
we won't be exploited?

488
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,800
No, it's true.

489
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:03,320
Mr Livingston, I fully understand
and I share your concerns.

490
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,720
You feel vulnerable.

491
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,640
And I know that this is a
very difficult question...

492
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,720
but what it comes down to is:

493
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,640
can you make a leap of faith in me

494
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,720
in the same way that I have to
make a leap of faith in you?

495
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,640
This is a great school. I don't
care what anybody says.

496
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,940
I mean, it's not perfect, but
like the people are really cool.

497
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,640
Like the teachers and kids...
they really care and all.

498
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:36,640
And I know that they make
fun of New Jersey all the time...

499
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,040
But I don't care. 
'Cause they're just snobs.

500
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,760
'Cause Jersey is where America's at!

501
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,680
Walking down these hallways ...

502
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,980
...hallways just like the ones I
once walked down as a teenager...

503
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,680
...I couldn't help I couldn't
help thinking back...

504
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,680
...to a time when every
day I woke up depressed...

505
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,600
...suicidal...

506
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,600
...consumed by despair.

507
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,600
Had things changed?

508
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,640
Was the competition to get into
the most prestigious schools...

509
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,720
...still a requisite rite of passage?

510
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,640
Beneath these masks of
courtesy and friendliness ...

511
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,640
I knew that there were 
darker forces at work...

512
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,640
...and I knew that Scooby was the key...

513
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,760
...to revealing the truth...

514
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,640
Scooby, Scooby, Scooby.

515
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,760
What are you thinking?

516
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,640
College, SATs...

517
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,960
your parents, your brothers,
your friends...

518
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,760
How is it you deal
with all this stress?

519
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,680
The pressure to get into the
college of your choice...

520
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,760
...is incredible.

521
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,680
You know, they did 
a study recently 

522
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,680
of the youth in Bosnia
during the bombing...

523
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,680
...and they found that the stress the
young people experienced there...

524
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,600
...was less than what American 
high school students go through...

525
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,720
...when applying to college.

526
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,600
Is that right?

527
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,720
- Yes
- Oh, my God...

528
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,720
So whaddya think?

529
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,720
Well, I'm not really sure 
what you're trying to say.

530
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,640
It's funny, I suppose.

531
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,640
But it seems glib and facile to just make
fun of how idiotic these people are.

532
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,760
I'm not making fun.

533
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,640
I'm showing it as it really is.

534
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,640
You're showing how superior
you are to your subject.

535
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,640
No, but I like my subject.
I like these people.

536
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,760
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do. I love them!

537
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,680
- The camerawork's nice.
- Thanks

538
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:00,760
I'll tell Mike.

539
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,720
It's still just a beginning..

540
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,600
I know I can...

541
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,720
...dig deeper.

542
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,640
But Marj, may I call you Marj?

543
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,740
what it really boils down to is
...what does it mean to be a Jew?

544
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,140
Exactly. Tzedakah. Charity.

545
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,720
And the new wing at Beth Israel is...

546
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,900
Well, actually,
last year you gave $500.

547
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,920
But this year $1,000 would not only be a
mitzvah, it would bring you to a new level...

548
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,640
Yes, of course. Your gift 
would also give you a Chagall 

549
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,760
menorah and two tickets to
the dinner dance this spring....

550
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,640
Because it's true:
Israel needs us now..

551
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:53,760
If not not now, when?

552
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,640
Well, that's wonderful...
I'll speak to you next week.

553
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:01,760
You too!
Take care!

554
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,720
Hi, Scooby!

555
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,900
- How was school today?
- Fine.

556
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,900
- Ready for tomorrow?
- What's tomorrow?

557
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,600
The SATs, knucklehead.

558
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,720
I'm not taking them.

559
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,720
Back.

560
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,640
- Mom?
- Yes, Mikey?

561
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,640
I was looking through on of 
Scooby's SATs practice books

562
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,640
this afternoon and I took one of the
practice tests. Guess what score I got?

563
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,640
What?

564
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,640
550 verbal, 520 math.

565
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,680
And I'm only in fifth grade!

566
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,720
Yeah?

567
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,600
We have to talk.

568
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,990
- Whaddya wanna talk about?
- Don't screw around with me.
You know what I'm talking about.

569
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,990
You're taking those SATs.

570
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:26,600
You're taking those SATs or your

571
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,600
CD collection is history.
You're taking those SATs and

572
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,990
you're going to college. You're taking those
SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair...

573
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,920
...but buddy your taking them!

574
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,720
OK.

575
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,720
Tired of this shit...

576
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,680
FUCK THIS SHIT

577
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,760
So are you surprised that
Scooby took the SATs after all?

578
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,760
Not really.
He's kind of a wuss.

579
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,680
OK. How about you, Cheryl?
Were you surprised?

580
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:30,760
I dunno. Whatever.

581
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,800
Hey, how come you
drive such a shitty car?

582
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,680
That's interesting, though.
A cool car.

583
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,680
Is that something that's
real important to you, Brady?

584
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,800
Yeah!

585
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,680
Pretty cool, Stanley.

586
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,680
Thanks.

587
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,680
How'd you get it?

588
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,800
It's my Dad's. He hides it under
some old TV Guides in his closet.

589
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,720
Gee, your Dad's smart.

590
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,640
I know.

591
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,760
Is it loaded

592
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,760
No, I don't think so...

593
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,640
Scooby, don't!
Be careful!

594
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:14,760
I'm not an idiot, man.
I watch TV.

595
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,640
I know. I'm sorry. 
I'm just...

596
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,760
...a little nervous, I don't know why.

597
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,760
You should be.

598
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,760
Here. You can keep it.

599
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,680
Scooby?

600
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,800
Yeah?

601
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,760
I like you.

602
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,640
Yeah. I know.

603
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,640
I mean...

604
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,640
I know.

605
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,760
Everyone knows.

606
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,640
Do you think...

607
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,760
...do you think that 
you'd let me...um...?

608
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,760
OK.

609
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,760
If you feel like it.

610
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,760
Just give me a second.

611
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,760
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

612
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:45,760

613
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,680

614
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,680
Hey, Scooby!
How's it going?

615
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,800
Conan O'Brien?

616
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,680
Whoa! What are you doing here?

617
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:03,640
I'm looking for a last-minute guest
for my show. Any suggestions?

618
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,720
- I'll be your guest!
- Really?

619
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,720
Well, all right! Let's take a look at
the television and see how we look.

620
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,640
Cool.

621
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,640
Welcome to the show, Scooby.

622
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,640
- Thank you.
- Nice to have you here.

623
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,640
And thank you for dressing up for us.
This is very classy.

624
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,940
Tell us. What kind of professional
plans do you have?

625
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,640
What's in your future?

626
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,640
Well, I was thinking...

627
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,640
...I might work for you.

628
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,760
Ahh...tell me. What do you want
to do for me? What's your idea?

629
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,640
Be your sidekick.

630
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,640
You know, and maybe...

631
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,680
...eventually become a 
TV talk-show host.

632
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,680
TV talk-show host, OK.

633
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,680
You were at sidekick eight seconds ago,
then TV talk-show host.

634
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,680
You'll be a Latin dictator
in a bout a minute.

635
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,680
Let's see what they think of the first idea.
I'm curious what the audience thinks.

636
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,760
Folks, what do you think:
should Scooby be my new sidekick?

637
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:01,800
Scooby, new sidekick, everybody!

638
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,720
What's up?

639
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,640
There's something I need
to talk about with you.

640
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,760
What?

641
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,760
There are some rumors...

642
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,760
Like what?

643
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,760
You know...

644
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,760
Stanley...

645
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,760
And like, don't take
this the wrong way...

646
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,760
I mean, I'm cool...

647
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,760
but...you know...

648
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,720
I've got a good
reputation at school...

649
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,720
I really don't want it ruined.

650
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,600
No prob.

651
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,720
I'm cool.

652
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,720
Thanks, Scoob.

653
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,640
Esposito, What the fuck do
you think you're doing?

654
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,640
You're tackling like a bitch
on my football team, son!

655
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,640
You gotta bend your ass
over and hit somebody!

656
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,640
- You understand me?
- Yes, sir!

657
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,640
Then do it!...Livingston!

658
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,760
That's the way to
hit that hole, son!

659
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,640
We're gonna become a football team 
today, guys! Let's move the ball!

660
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,680
Move! Move! Move!
I wanna see you hit those holes!

661
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,760
Defense, fill those goddam gaps!
Let's go, guys! Let's do it

662
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,720
Check left!
Check left!

663
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,360
Red seventeen!
Red seventeen!

664
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,720
KILL HIM!

665
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,600
When I'm in high school...

666
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,600
...I'm not going to
play any football.

667
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,720
I'm just going to
concentrate on class rank.

668
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,600
What did you do in high school?

669
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,720
I did not go to high school.

670
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,720
Weren't there high
schools in El Salvador?

671
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,720
We had to work.

672
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,600
My family was poor.

673
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,720
Must've been hard being poor.

674
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,720
I'm still poor.

675
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,640
But, Consuelo,
even though your poor...

676
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,720
...don't you have any hobbies
or interests or anything?

677
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,640
No, Mikey.

678
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,720
But like, what do you like to
do when you're not working?

679
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,640
I'm always working.

680
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,640
But when you're not.
Like now.

681
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,640
What do you like to do?

682
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,640
This is work.

683
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,600
But it's not like real work.

684
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,680
This is just babysitting.

685
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,600
You know...

686
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,600
...your job's really not so
bad, if you think about it.

687
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,720
You should smile more.

688
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:23,600
When the sky is clear
and the sun is warm...

689
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,600
you're reminded of how
beautiful things can be:

690
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:28,720
a lamp post...

691
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,720
...a sign...

692
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,640
...a straw wrapper 
blowing in the wind.

693
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,640
But when that dark cloud appears...

694
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:42,720
...you realize how fragile
the balance of life is.

695
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,640
When Brady first
arrived at the hospital...

696
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,640
...he was unresponsive 
to verbal stimuli.

697
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:51,640
We performed a CT scan which
demonstrated a

698
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,960
large subdural hemoto
a with mass effect.

699
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,720
Since the removal of the
subdural he's been in coma.

700
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,640
When I first met the Livingstons
it was in the first twenty four hours

701
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,640
of Brady coming in after his
tragic football accident

702
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,640
and they were acting
in a fairly typical way...

703
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:12,640
We're not the ones who need the help.
My son needs help.

704
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,680
My son's in there! He can't even feed
himself, he can't eat. I don't even know

705
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,680
if he's going to be a vegetable
or not, for Chrissake!

706
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,680
But what about Scooby?

707
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,680
How would this effect him?

708
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,760
What meaning is to
be found in this?

709
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,680
This is definitely better.

710
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,680
You think so? You don't think that
this might not be a little dry?

711
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,680
This is not an entertainment
you're making, Toby.

712
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,680
This story about a kid in the suburbs and the
state of the college admissions process has...

713
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,980
...with this Brady crisis, evolved into
something much richer and more provocative.

714
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:53,680
Yes, I know…But still, it should
be somewhat entertaining.

715
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:56,720
I mean, without this footage, 
without this rigorous documentation...

716
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,720
...it would feel like exploitation.

717
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:02,760
No, no, no. No exploitation. 
This is serious

718
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,720
But don't you find it a little
funny too, at the same time?

719
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,640
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. 
Will you tell me what's funny about that?

720
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,640
About a kid in a coma?

721
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,640
- Nothing, I guess...
- I mean, why are you making this documentary

722
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,640
if you can't treat your subject
with appropriate gravity?

723
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,760
OK, you're right, you're right.

724
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,680
You know, we need to 
screen what we've got...

725
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:30,680
invite some regular people, just 
some random off-the-street types...

726
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,680
...and see what real
people think of this.

727
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:36,680
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way
to go. You still need a lot more footage...

728
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,990
and it's probably a little
premature to start screening.

729
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,680
OK, then we can invite 
serious intellectual types.

730
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,680
- We're not ready.
- Hip alternative types who will
understand the process better...

731
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:48,680
- We're not ready!
- Well, I need to see this with an audience!

732
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,680
What's an audience 
going to tell you?

733
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,800
I don't know. 
Maybe they'll like it.

734
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:37,760
Consuelo! I spilled some
grape juice on the floor!

735
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,760
Are you crying?

736
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,640
No.

737
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,640
Yes, you are.
I can tell.

738
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,760
What's the matter?

739
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,760
Speak English.

740
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,680
I'm sorry, but you know
if you don't speak English

741
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,760
I can't understand you.

742
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,680
My Jesus...

743
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,800
Who is Jesus?

744
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,680
My baby.

745
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,800
You have a baby?

746
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,680
My grandchild-baby.

747
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:05,720
Gee, I didn't even know
you had any children.

748
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,720
But why are you so
upset about Jesus?

749
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,720
He's dead.

750
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,720
How did it happen?

751
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,760
He was executed.

752
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,760
He was on Death Row

753
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,640
and then he was executed.

754
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,760
How did they execute him?

755
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,760
Poison gas.

756
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,640
Maybe it's for the best...

757
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:44,680
I mean, if he was guilty of 
doing something wrong...

758
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,680
People who are bad should be killed.

759
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,680
Don't you think so?

760
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,760
Jesus was not bad.

761
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,760
Maybe he was and you 
just didn't know it.

762
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,760
He wasn't.

763
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,600
But still, you can't be sure.

764
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,600
I am sure.

765
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,720
But really, you never know.

766
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,720
I know!

767
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,720
Why was he on Death Row?

768
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,760
For rape and murder.

769
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:32,720
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?

770
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:41,760
It is when you love someone...

771
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,760
...and they don't love you.

772
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,760
And then you do
something about it.

773
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,760
Sometimes I feel like my
parents don't love me.

774
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,680
Well then, when you get older

775
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,760
you can do something about it.

776
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,640
I spilled some grape juice upstairs.

777
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,720
Do you think you could
clean up the floor now?

778
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,760
Dad?

779
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,760
Do you think that Brady
will ever get better?

780
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,760
One in a million recover.

781
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,760
Maybe he's that one in a million!

782
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,760
Mikey, there's optimism...

783
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,680
..and then there's stupidity..

784
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,680
It's a very fine line.

785
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,600
I don't think there's
any hope, either.

786
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,600
I was just trying to
make you feel better.

787
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,720
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

788
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,720
Dad?

789
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:18,720
Would you let me try
hypnotizing you now?

790
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,640
Yeah. Sure Go ahead.
Hypnotize me.

791
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,720
OK. Stay there.
I'll be right back.

792
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,720
Just a sec!

793
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,720
Be right there!

794
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,760
Could you turn around to me, please?
Thanks.

795
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,640
All right.

796
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,760
You must look at
this shiny object 

797
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,760
and concentrate.

798
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,760
Relax your legs.

799
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,680
Relax your arms.

800
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,720
Relax your shoulders.

801
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,720
Now keep your eyes
on the shiny object.

802
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,720
Your eyelids 

803
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,600
Heavier.

804
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,600
You're getting sleepy.

805
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,720
Sleepier.

806
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,720
Now let your eyes close shut

807
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:33,720
and you are sound asleep.

808
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:50,720
Now you are completely
under my power.

809
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,640
I am the only voice you can hear...

810
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,760
...the only voice
you will listen to.

811
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,760
Now. When you wake up

812
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,600
you will be in a good mood.

813
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:07,600
You won't worry so
much about Brady.

814
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,600
And I will be your
favorite from now on.

815
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,600
If Brady dies...

816
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,600
...you can be sad for a little bit...

817
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:19,600
...but I will still be the most 
important person in your life.

818
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,600
You will never be mean to me...

819
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,720
...and always give me whatever I want.

820
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,600
Also, you should fire Consuelo.

821
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,600
She's lazy.

822
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,600
Now when I snap my fingers...

823
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,600
...you will remember nothing...

824
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,640
...but you will do 
everything I have asked.

825
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,640
One.

826
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,720
Two.

827
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:44,720
Three.

828
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,640
Hey, Mikey. 
You wanna get some ice cream?

829
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,760
OK!

830
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,760
So like, yeah...

831
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,760
...I caved in.

832
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,640
I mean, I had to.

833
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,640
My parents...

834
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,760
...they're like still really
depressed about Brady.

835
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,680
So I wrote the bullshit essay.

836
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,760
Filled out the applications,
did the interviews.

837
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,680
I figure I can always drop out.

838
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,680
So where'd you get in?

839
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,760
Princeton.

840
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,800
But what did you get on your SATs?

841
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,800
200 verbal/710 math.

842
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,800
Kinda weird, I know, but... 

843
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,800
But I think they thought it was, like...

844
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,800
...good-weird.

845
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,680
We used pull.

846
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,680
You know, you have to.
Sometimes you just have to, Toby.

847
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,680
But what kind of pull did you have?

848
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,720
I have a cousin.
Very big giver to the alumni fund.

849
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,720
- It's all about who you know.
- Look, we're not suckers.

850
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,760
- Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
- He's right.

851
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,640
- Damn, Toby.
- It´s too hard.

852
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,760
- This thing won't open again.
- Let me try it, let me try it.

853
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,760
It's um...The button is just stuck.

854
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,640
I was wondering...
Is the documentary almost finished?

855
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,640
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.

856
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,760
- Can I see what you have so far?
- Sure...um......

857
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,760
...yeah...as soon as I have a
screening I'll let you know.

858
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,760
- Thanks man.
- OK.

859
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,760
Gin! I win!
Let's play again!

860
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,680
- Hey, Mikey!
- Hey, Dad!

861
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,680
- Come here, give me a hug!
- Gee, you're home early!

862
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:50,900
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and 
keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit?

863
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,800
- I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
- Sure, Dad.

864
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,640
Mrs. Livingston and I 
have discussed this...

865
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,640
...and we've come to the conclusion that...

866
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,640
...we are not very happy 
with your work lately...

867
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:17,760
...so we're going to let you go.

868
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,640
I-I don't understand.

869
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:24,640
We've been happy with you in the past, 
but now we think maybe it's time for a change

870
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,640
I know you've had trouble at home...

871
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,680
...and maybe, you know, some of 
that is reflected in your work...

872
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,680
But, Mr Livingston...

873
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:35,080
...I work very hard for
you and your family!

874
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,980
I understand that, and I'm sorry

875
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,760
I'm sorry it had 
to end this way.

876
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,720
TOBY OXMAN
DOCUMENTARIAN

877
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,640
Florsheim.
Can I help you?

878
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,640
Hi. I…uh...I'm trying 
to reach Toby Oxman?

879
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,640
Sorry, he's off today.

880
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,760
OK.

881
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,760
Um...Thanks

882
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,680
Hey, uh, Mike.

883
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,720
- Is Toby here?
- Uh, no, he's not.

884
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,640
Oh. Do you have any
idea where he might be?

885
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,420
I think he's at a test screening.

886
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,640
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids.

887
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,640
He just hit a...a speed bump.

888
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,640
Now he's gonna find his way,
his path is gonna be cleared...

889
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,680
...and I think he's gonna continue
his education at a good college.

890
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,760
And everybody else
is gonna be happy.

891
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,680
Mr Livingston...

892
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,680
...aren't you a bit fearful that
Scooby will be confronted with...

893
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:59,760
...with hollow values and 
systemic conformism?

894
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,000
I don't know why this is so
hard for you to comprehend.

895
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,600
I had a terrific time in college.

896
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,640
I've got a terrific job,
a comfortable salary, terrific wife...

897
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:12,640
...three terrific kids...and every
year I give to the alumni fund.

898
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:16,840
Now why are you trying to make college
out to be a bad thing, a negative experience?

899
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:19,640
You had a negative experience?
Well, to bad!

900
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,640
Get over it!

901
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,640
Stop trying to impose
your misery on others

902
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,000
by going around saying,
'Life is bad, life is horrible.'

903
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,760
Life is tough on you?
Well, boo hoo!

904
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,760
Well, yeah, my Dad
is kind of a goofball.

905
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,940
I just have to pretend to
go along with his ideas.

906
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,640
'Cause

907
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,760
he really doesn't get it:

908
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,640
like I could be the next Oprah,
for all he knows...

909
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,760
...but he's never even seen the show.

910
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,680
What is most important to you?

911
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,760
I dunno.

912
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,760
I'd like to be good at something.

913
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,600
It doesn't have to be TV.
I mean...

914
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,600
...it could be movies...

915
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,600
Anything.

916
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,720
I'd be willing to direct.


917
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,640
But I'd like to be...

918
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,720
...you know...

919
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,720
...famous.

920
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,720
Not necessarily a superstar...

921
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,720
...just famous.

922
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,760
Be recognized.

923
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:40,640
Get fan Mail. 
Things...

924
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,640
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you 
want to be a TV talk-show host and all...

925
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,640
...like Conan O'Brien...

926
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,760
...but did you know
even he went to college?

927
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,760
- He did?
- Yeah. He went to Harward.

928
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:13,720
Mom? Dad?

929
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,600
Can I sleep with you?
I-I'm scared.

930
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,720
- Sure!
- Of course, honey. Come on.

931
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:24,720
Snug as a bug in a rug.

932
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,720
Yeah, here you go, pal.

933
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,720
You're monster-proofed.

934
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:46,720
Oh, my God, Scooby!

935
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,640
I'm so sorry.

936
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:52,720
- I'm so, so sorry...
- Don't be.

937
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,760
Your movie's a hit.
