1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,837
Stacee! Stacee! Stacee!

2
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:09,633
MAN  : Ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready to rock?

3
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:13,929
Welcome to the famous Bourbon Room
on the Sunset Strip:

4
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:18,392
Stacee Jaxx and Arsenal!

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,852
Hey, Los Angeles!

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,061
 

7
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:24,440
This is a little song called
"Paradise City."

8
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,276
 
Oh!

9
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,486
 

10
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:34,908
Just an urchin livin' under the street
I'm a hard case that's tough to beat

11
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:37,786
I'm your charity case
So buy me something to eat

12
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:41,040
I'll pay you at another time

13
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,375
Take it to the end of the line

14
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,295
Take me down to the paradise city

15
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,672
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,925
Take me home

17
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,343
Yeah, yeah

18
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:56,472
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green

19
00:00:56,639 --> 00:01:01,268


20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,074

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,074

22
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:46,396
  Sister Christian
Oh, the time has come

23
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:53,278
And you know that you're the only one
To say

24
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,781
Okay

25
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:03,038
Where you going?
What you looking for?

26
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:07,376
You know those boys
Don't want to play no more

27
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,711
With you

28
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:21,223
It's true

29
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,809
Yeah

30
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,478
ALL:
You're motoring

31
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:30,023
What's your price for flight?

32
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:35,404
In finding Mr. Right

33
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:40,367
You'll be all right tonight

34
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:35,964
This must be just like livin' in paradise

35
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:41,220
And I don't wanna go home

36
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:49,645
This must be just like livin' in paradise

37
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,733
And I don't wanna go home

38
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,653
Hey, hey!

39
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,530
 

40
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,409
 
Yeah, yeah, yeah

41
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,664
Girl, you've been meant for this
Since you were born

42
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,415
Since she was born

43
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,209
No problem now

44
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,877
The coast is clear

45
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:18,507
It's just the calm before the storm

46
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:22,427
This must be just like livin' in paradise

47
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,637
 

48
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,180
Paradise

49
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:33,897
And I don't wanna go home

50
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,816
Whoa

51
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,485
Not a dime, I can't pay my rent

52
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,697
I can barely make it through the week

53
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,701
Saturday night I'd like to meet my girl

54
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,996
But right now I can't make ends meet

55
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:53,542
I'm always workin'
Slavin' every day

56
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,629
Gotta get a break
From the same old same old

57
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,424
I need a chance just to get away

58
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:04,011
If you could hear me think
This is what I'd say

59
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:08,223
Don't need nothin' but a good time

60
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,226
How can I resist?

61
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:15,314
Ain't lookin' for nothin'
But a good time

62
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,900
And it don't get better than this

63
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,780
LONNY:
Come on, son. Up you get!

64
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,491
Whoa!

65
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,201
Go to rehab!

66
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,662
Yo, Lonny,
how come you never take out the trash?

67
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,249
I leave that to you. You're a musician,
so it's important that you suffer.

68
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,336
I'm talentless,
so suffering's wasted on me.

69
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,589
When was the last time you suffered?
Six o'clock this evening...

70
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,591
...when I got up for work.

71
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,800
 

72
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:47,387
  Say I spend my money
On women and wine

73
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,932
But I couldn't tell you where
I spent last night

74
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,394
I'm really sorry about the shape I'm in

75
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:58,023
I just-a like my fun every now and then

76
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:02,402
I'm always workin'
Slavin' every day

77
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,031
Gotta get a break
From the same old same old

78
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,159
I need a chance just to get away

79
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,871
If you could hear me think
This is what I'd say

80
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,250
ALL  :
Don't need nothin' but a good time

81
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,503
How can I resist?

82
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:23,799
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time

83
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:28,011
And it don't get better than this

84
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,638
ALL:
Dennis! Dennis!

85
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,307
 
You see, I raise a toast to all of us

86
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,977
Who are breakin' our backs every day

87
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,440
If wantin' the good life is such a crime

88
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,819
A-Lord, then put me away

89
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,529
Here's to ya

90
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,989
Ow!

91
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:04,214
ALL: Don't need nothin' but a good time
Oh, yeah, yeah

92
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,217
Hey, baby, come on, give me a kiss.

93
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,052
Drew!
Come on, give me a kiss! Hey!

94
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,929
Come on!
BETH: Drew!

95
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,973
Get him out!
DRUNK: Come on.

96
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:17,352
I've had enough of this! Tell Dennis I quit!
Beth! Come on!

97
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,147
 
Livin' in paradise

98
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:28,029
And I don't wanna go home

99
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,781
DRUNK:
I love her, man! Come on!

100
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,663
PROTESTER:
You're all gonna go to hell!

101
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,540
MAN:
Hey.

102
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,792
Where you from?
Oklahoma.

103
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,878
Well, welcome to Hollywood.

104
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,213
Thanks.
Give me that!

105
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,382
Let go! Come on! Let me have it!
No! No!

106
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,050
Hey!
MAN: Give me it!

107
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,719
SHERRIE: Stop it!
DREW: Leave her alone!

108
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,430
SHERRIE:
Wait! Oh, stop! Please! Somebody!

109
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,849
DREW: Ugh....
SHERRIE: No. No. No.

110
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,267
Are you okay?

111
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,477
Shit.

112
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,979
Did he take your money?
He took my records.

113
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,355
Oh, my God.

114
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,943
Look, I'm sorry this happened. It sucks.

115
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,361
I'm Drew.

116
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,614
Sherrie.

117
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,700
"The Bourbon Room"?

118
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,578
You work at The Bourbon Room?
Yeah. I'm a barback.

119
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,499
One of these days,
my name's gonna be up there.

120
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,584
You're in a band?
I'm a singer.

121
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,127
Get out! Me too.

122
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:28,715
Oh, my God. The Bourbon Room. I have,
like, 10 albums that were recorded there.

123
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,425
More like"had"?

124
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,514
Had.

125
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,849
Yep.

126
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,310
Well, thank you.

127
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,270
Thanks.

128
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,522
Again.

129
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,360
WOMAN 1:
Don't go in there, it's filth!

130
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,196
 

131
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,281
Hey.
WOMAN 2: Don't join them!

132
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,535
Do you need a job?
I could talk to Dennis Dupree, my boss.

133
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,286
WOMAN 3:
Pray you'll be saved!

134
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,746
Are you serious?

135
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:03,041
Just whatever you do,
don't tell him you're a singer.

136
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,628
 

137
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,341
DENNIS:
Jimmy!

138
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,970
I told you 10,000 times.
Girls drink free, dudes pay full freight.

139
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,765
They are dudes.

140
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,812
Look, I haven't charged a girl since '73.

141
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:29,234
For a minute, I thought that
Kate Jackson from Charlie's Angels...

142
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,153
...had walked into my club.
More like Michael Jackson.

143
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:35,240
Doesn't he look pale to you?
He does a bit.

144
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,951
Dennis! Meet Sherrie.
She needs a job, man.

145
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,078
No, I don't think so. She's a singer.

146
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,997
No, she just came in
from out of town.

147
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,582
DENNIS:
Oh, okay, now, if I may.

148
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,293
You sang in the church choir every Sunday.
Lutheran.

149
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,421
Senior year, you had the third lead
in your high school musical.

150
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,382
Sound of Music.
DENNIS: And then somebody...

151
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,719
...your adorable Aunt Betty,
told you you had real talent.

152
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:59,055
It was actually my Aunt Doris.
DENNIS: Uh-huh.

153
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:03,518
And like a flaming dipshit you believed her,
dumped your jock boyfriend...

154
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,772
...ditched town and moved to Hollywood
to have a crack at fame and fortune.

155
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,399
Am I missing anything?

156
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,319
I....

157
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,653
Yeah, okay.

158
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:20,118
SHERRIE: Actually, my boyfriend
wasn't really athletic.

159
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,287
And look. I'm a waitress.

160
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,498
Come on. She's practically
got mike burns on her lips.

161
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,710
I'm not interested, sweetheart.
I need you two to get back to work.

162
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,422
Please, Mr. Dupree. I'm a hard worker.
You seem like a really nice kid.

163
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,632
I just got mugged.

164
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,385
I have $17 to my name and I'm probably
gonna be starving in the next 48 hours.

165
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,055
And Beth just quit.
Beth just quit?

166
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,517
Okay, fine. You're hired.

167
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,103
Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

168
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,899
What are you thanking me for? I ruined
your life. You start training tomorrow.

169
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,902
This place is turning into a war zone.
It's Arsenal's last show.

170
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,946
Arsenal? Oh, my God, I love Stacee Jaxx.

171
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,783
It's your lucky day. He's going solo.

172
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,535
Hey, want to go celebrate?
I'm coming up on my break.

173
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,037
Yeah. Sure.

174
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,247
 

175
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,834
A year ago....

176
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,920
A year ago,
people asked whose campaign...

177
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,506
...I would throw
my financial support behind...

178
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,092
...and I knew there was only one man
on the ticket...

179
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,719
...that could restore the city
to its original glory.

180
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:24,474
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mayor Mike Whitmore.

181
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,936
MIKE: Thank you. Couldn't have done it
without you, Doug.

182
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,771
Ahh.

183
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,439
Thank you, Los Angeles.

184
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,566
 

185
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,153
You know, Doug Flintlock here...

186
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:42,409
...well, he just leaned into my ear
and he said:

187
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:46,413
"Mike, I have kids. Teenagers.

188
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,666
And these days, I'm scared for them.

189
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,211
We need to clean up this city."

190
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,755
Well, I can tell you that...

191
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:59,467
...I, for one, am not scared
for our city's children.

192
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:04,139
And that's because
I have a secret weapon.

193
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,391
My rock.

194
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,976
My soul mate.

195
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:12,063
And the best darn wife
any man could hope to have.

196
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,566
Please welcome my wife:

197
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,526
The beautiful Patricia Whitmore!

198
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,736
 

199
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,112
Oh.

200
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,406
Come on up here, Patty-cake!

201
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,658
We did it!

202
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,746
Oh. Thank you.

203
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,917
Today, the city of Los Angeles
gets a twofer!

204
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,756
Not only the best mayor this city
has ever had...

205
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,674
...but also me.

206
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,634
A mother.

207
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:46,473
So tomorrow, as part of my
"Clean Up The Strip" initiative...

208
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,517
...we start to make this city safe
again for our young people.

209
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,687
She looks familiar to me, this woman.
She looks eerily familiar.

210
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,774
You've probably popped something on
your ass that resembles her.

211
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,611
I shouldn't have thought so. That's all
cleared up nicely, thank you very much.

212
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,740
Rock 'n' roll is a disease.
But it is a disease with a cure.

213
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,033
DENNIS:
You don't know her.

214
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,912
Man, back then, her husband,
Mayor Whitmore...

215
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,539
...used to be one of my best customers.

216
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,334
Wow. Now look at him.

217
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,212
Married to a woman
who looks like she's been hibernating...

218
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,255
...in Margaret Thatcher's bumhole.

219
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,008
-off our streets
and knock the sucker back....

220
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,135
What happens to people?

221
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,470
Don't know, Den.

222
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,015
Suppose they get corrupted
and seduced by the Man...

223
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,518
...get old and bitter and run for mayor.

224
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,062
Or they run a club,
live the rock 'n' roll dream...

225
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,649
...and get old and bitter that way.
Here's to rock 'n' roll.

226
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,858
To rock 'n' roll.

227
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:43,363
And let's reclaim the Strip for the
God-fearing citizens of Los Angeles!

228
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,747


229
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,131
I cannot believe
that I'm working at The Bourbon.

230
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,675
Thank you so much.

231
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,176
Don't even mention it.

232
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,762
Oh, my God.
Arsenal Live at The Bourbon.

233
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,723
Hands down, favorite record ever.
Me too.

234
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:14,769
I would've killed to be at that concert.
That record really changed my life.

235
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,189
I decided if I couldn't see Stacee Jaxx...

236
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,191
...I was gonna be Stacee Jaxx.

237
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,529
 
Bought a beat-up six string

238
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,364
In a secondhand store

239
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,033
Didn't know how to play it

240
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,619
But I knew for sure

241
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,497
That one guitar

242
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,500
Felt good in my hands

243
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,003
Didn't take long

244
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,547
To understand

245
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,007
Just one guitar

246
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,135
Slung way down low

247
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,304
Was a one-way ticket

248
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,640
Only one way to go

249
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,518
So I started rockin'
Rockin'

250
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,478
Ain't never gonna stop
No

251
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,982
Gotta keep on rockin'
Rockin'

252
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,152
Someday I'm gonna make it to the top
And sing

253
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,654
I love rock 'n' roll

254
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,324
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby

255
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,743
I love rock 'n' roll

256
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,996
So come and take your time
And dance with me

257
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,082
In a town with no name

258
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,418
In a heavy downpour

259
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,670
Thought I passed my own shadow

260
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,590
By the backstage door

261
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,717
Like a trip through the past

262
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,345
To that day in the rain

263
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,847
And that one guitar

264
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,935
Made my whole life change

265
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,521
And we'll be movin' on and singin'
That same old song

266
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,231
Yeah, with me
Singin'

267
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,901
And be a jukebox hero

268
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,445
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby

269
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,073
I'm a jukebox hero

270
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,450
So come and take your time
And dance with me

271
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,036
Just-a one guitar
CHORUS: Jukebox hero

272
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,914
DREW & SHERRIE:
Got stars in my eyes

273
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:03,127
I'm just a jukebox hero
Ah, ah, ah

274
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,588
Jukebox hero
CHORUS: Stars, stars

275
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,966
I love rock 'n' roll

276
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,760
Jukebox hero
CHORUS: Stars, stars

277
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,262
So come and take your time
And dance with me

278
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:19,936
DREW & SHERRIE:
Stars in our eyes

279
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,398
I love rock 'n' roll

280
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,076
Whoa.

281
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,042
SHERRIE:
Whew.

282
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,755
The problem is, I think I'll only ever
be good on a jukebox.

283
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,173
What do you mean?

284
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,803
I get stage fright.

285
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,431
You've gotta be kidding me.

286
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,266
No.

287
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,601
You've gotta breathe.

288
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,270
I think I got that part down.

289
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:06,107
No, I'm serious, you've gotta breathe.
Like, takes away the nerves.

290
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:11,320
Breathe in through your nose
and out through your mouth.

291
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,239
Do it a couple times. You'll be fine.

292
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,120
Maybe you should help me practice.

293
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,669
Are you asking me out on a date?

294
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,963
Yeah.

295
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,468
Then yes.

296
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,470
Cool.

297
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:41,476
Okay, well, I should probably check
into my motel and grab my stuff, so....

298
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,977
Gotta get back to work.

299
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,188
Okay, well, bye. Oh.
Bye.

300
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,149
Bye. Oh. Ha-ha.

301
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,484
Sorry.

302
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,322
SECRETARY:
Well, good night.

303
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,199
See you tomorrow, Mrs. Whitmore.

304
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,993
Mr. Whitmore. Call me.

305
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,787
PATRICIA:
Mm.

306
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:01,996
Mike?
Mm.

307
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,665
Why so jumpy?
Oh.

308
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,669
Well, it's just that Doug Flintlock.

309
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:12,006
He wants the Strip, Patty-cake,
and we have to deliver.

310
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,008
Of course we will, sweetheart.

311
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,010
How?

312
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:20,598
We'll go after the head of the snake.
Ooh.

313
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,768
The Bourbon.
Oh, right.

314
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,021
If we cut off the head, the Strip will die.

315
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:31,734
The Bourbon could be a Benetton
by the end of the month.

316
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:32,985
 

317
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,197
Now listen: Me and the ladies
are going after all the church groups...

318
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,532
...to make this happen.

319
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,909
We're even talking
to the Health Department.

320
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,620
We should review all their paperwork
for violations.

321
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,871
Oh, trust me...

322
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,791
...if we find so much as a hair
in a cocktail olive...

323
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,626
...we're shutting them down.

324
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,880
Hey, boss, we found some hairs
in the cocktail olives again.

325
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,882
Then rinse them off.

326
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,551
Okay.

327
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:57,760
No!

328
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,888
Nobody puts Donkey in the corner!

329
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,516
That game's too bloody surreal anyway.
Ugh!

330
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,560
Dennis, did you just sigh audibly? Why?

331
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:09,230
Taxes. They're so un-rock 'n' roll.

332
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:13,568
Cheer up, mate. You still got
the twisted sisters of piety outside...

333
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:17,071
...all flustered and worked up,
so we must be doing something right, eh?

334
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,824
Well, at least we have
the Arsenal show coming up.

335
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:24,328
But that means our whole existence
is riding on Stacee Jaxx.

336
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,416
Stacee Jaxx, the most unreliable man
in the music industry?

337
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,586
A man who blew off the halftime show
at the Super Bowl...

338
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,922
...to attend a satanic ritual
to sew up Debbie Harry's vagina?

339
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,132
Please stop.

340
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,093
The Satanists wouldn't even do that.
You're not helping.

341
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,555
Why would the devil close vaginas?
No one's qualified to do that.

342
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,764
Hand me the phone.

343
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:48,102
Let's do a telethon, because this might
work better than your Stacee Jaxx idea.

344
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,854
Shut it!

345
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,523
I'm calling Stacee's manager, Paul Gill.

346
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,028
 

347
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:01,282
Ahem. Speak.
DENNIS: Hello, Paul? It's Dennis Dupree.

348
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,284
Dennis. What's up, brother man?

349
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,663
Oh, I was just calling to check in
and see if we're still on for Friday.

350
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,333
Of course we are. Arsenal's last show.

351
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,793
We're kicking off Stacee's
solo press tour there.

352
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,795
Rolling Stone just confirmed.

353
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,965
They would like to interview him
on the premises, okay?

354
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,718
What did he say?
He told me to turn off the radio.

355
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,803
So turn it off.
The radio in his head!

356
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,472
Calm down!
Oh, God.

357
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:32,688
Paul?

358
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,109
Paul?
Oh, crap. Yeah, sorry, man.

359
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,946
Yeah. Is Stacee okay?

360
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,155
PAUL:
Stacee?

361
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:45,493
He's fantastic. I'm looking at him
right now. He's waving hello.

362
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,746
Yes, I'm talking to Dennis.
Oh-ho. He just flipped me off.

363
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,999
Same old Stacee. Right?
Okay, I gotta dash.

364
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,543
I'll talk to you Friday, babe, okay?

365
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,672
CROWD  
Stacee! Stacee! Stacee!

366
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,811
Put something on, man.

367
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,355
 

368
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,695
Banzai.
 

369
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,363
Jesus.

370
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,039
Stacee?

371
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,472
 

372
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,394
I didn't know you had a twin.

373
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,980
I don't.

374
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,692
Stacee.

375
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,572
You need to go on stage, man.

376
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,908
I am on stage, Paul.

377
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,248
Shit.

378
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,626
PATRICIA:
Take a good look, ladies.

379
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,420
Take a hard...

380
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,006
...good, long...

381
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,591
...hard...

382
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,842
...look.

383
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,972
This man, this man is responsible
for so much filth.

384
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,809
WOMAN: He's Satan.
MIKE: She is an extraordinary woman.

385
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,269
Such a beacon of courage.

386
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:39,273
He's like a machine
that spews out three things:

387
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,484
Sex...
WOMEN: Oh!

388
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,153
...hateful music...
Yes.

389
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,363
...and...

390
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,283
...sex!

391
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:53,204
Can you come take some dictation
for me in the parish office, Ms. Hoyt?

392
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,789
Of course, sir.

393
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:58,000
My son ate the head of my neighbor's
horse because of Stacee Jaxx.

394
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:04,131
Ugh. Well, his filthy little hateful music...

395
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,634
...sex ride is over.

396
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,969
Gotta stop!
WOMAN: Yes.

397
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,639
And we're the ones who are gonna do it.

398
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,140
 

399
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:17,853
  Well, you're a real tough cookie
With a long history

400
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:21,565
Of breaking little hearts
Like the one in me

401
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:26,195
That's okay
Let's see how you do it

402
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,491
Put up your dukes
Let's get down to it

403
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,662
Hit me with your best shot

404
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,791
Why don't you hit me
With your best shot?

405
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,294
Hit me with your best shot

406
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,673
Fire away

407
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,343
You come on with a come-on

408
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,886
You don't fight fair

409
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,849
That's okay
See if I care

410
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:58,519
Knock me down
It's all in vain

411
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:02,189
I'll get right back on my feet again

412
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,900
Hit me with your best shot

413
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,362
Why don't you hit me
With your best shot?

414
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,199
Hit me with your best shot

415
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,035
Fire away

416
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,539
WOMEN:
Pow! Pow!

417
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,042
Pow!

418
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:27,882
Well, you're a real tough cookie
With a long history

419
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,260
Of breaking little hearts
Like the one in me

420
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:35,055
Before I put another notch
In my lipstick case

421
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:39,310
You better make sure
You put me in my place

422
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,896
Hit me with your best shot

423
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,900
Come on!
Hit me with your best shot

424
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,403
Hit me with your best shot

425
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:53,741
Fire away

426
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,952
Hit me with your best shot

427
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,748
Why don't you hit me
With your best shot?

428
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,376
Hit me with your best shot

429
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:10,132
Fire away

430
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,556
 

431
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,058
Hah!

432
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:46,126
Ai! Jesus.
No, Chico. Jesus is my brother.

433
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,963
Oye, Dennis told me to tell you
to come in early tomorrow.

434
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,506
Yeah, sure. Whatever, man.

435
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:55,261
I need to go get ready. I have a big date
tonight with Sherrie. Wish me luck.

436
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,470
 

437
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,681
Yeah, whatever that means. Okay, bye.

438
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:09,483
 
So long

439
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:15,155
I've been looking too hard
I've been waiting too long

440
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:19,535
Sometimes I don't know
What I will find

441
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:23,998
I only know it's a matter of time

442
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:31,839
When you love someone

443
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:38,345
  It feels so right
So warm and true

444
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,516
I need to know if you feel it too

445
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,478
Maybe I'm wrong

446
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:52,067
Won't you tell me
If I'm coming on too strong?

447
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:56,739
This heart of mine has been hurt before

448
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,034
This time I wanna be sure

449
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,201
Hey, girl.

450
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:05,873
I've been waitin' for a girl like you

451
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,793
To come into my life

452
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:15,049
I've been waitin' for a girl like you

453
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:18,802
A love that will survive

454
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:24,224
I've been waitin' for someone new

455
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:28,312
To make me feel alive

456
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:33,567
Yeah, waitin' for a girl like you

457
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:37,738
To come into my life

458
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:42,284
Won't you come into my life?
Won't you come into my life?

459
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:05,432
SHERRIE: Wow. It's like a giant velvet blanket
covered in diamonds.

460
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,935
DREW:
Yeah, it's beautiful, isn't it?

461
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:12,314
SHERRIE: Yeah, it's a little different
than Tulsa, Oklahoma.

462
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:21,448
So, what did your mom think
about the big move to I.A?

463
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,118
She thought it was stupid.

464
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:28,706
My dad just totally didn't get it.

465
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,290
His advice:

466
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:34,628
"You're gonna fail anyway,
so why not fail closer to home?"

467
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,007
Okay. Total optimist.

468
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,514
What about your folks?
What did they think of the big move?

469
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,017
Um....

470
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,811
Not a whole lot really.

471
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,815
I was raised by my grandma.

472
00:28:56,609 --> 00:29:00,404
Yeah, she, by the way,
was all for me getting out of Oklahoma.

473
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,739
Really?
Mm.

474
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:05,367
Yeah, she said to me:
"Honey, there ain't nothing for you here...

475
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:10,664
...and the last thing that I want you to do
is wind up stuck here like me."

476
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,500
Man, I adore her.

477
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,843
You're a nice guy, aren't you?

478
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,055
I try to be.

479
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,975
Why?

480
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,313
She wanted to know.

481
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:41,612
Oh, my God,
I can't believe I'm actually here.

482
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,866
I'm so happy.

483
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,701
 

484
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:33,455
 
You're so good

485
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:38,502
When we make love
It's understood

486
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,090
It's more than a touch
A word we say

487
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:47,427
Only in dreams could it be this way

488
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:51,765
When you love someone, yeah

489
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,811
 
Really love someone

490
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,982
Now I know it's right

491
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:05,487
From the moment I wake up
Till deep in the night

492
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,920
There's nowhere on earth
That I'd rather be

493
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:26,049
Than holding you tenderly

494
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:30,846
I've been waitin' for a girl like you
I've been waitin' for a boy like you

495
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:35,100
To come into my life
To come into my life

496
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,564
I've been waitin' for a girl like you
I've been waitin' for a boy like you

497
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,568
A love that will survive
A love that will survive

498
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,903
I've been waitin'
I've been waitin'

499
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,656
For someone new
For someone new

500
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:53,577
To make me feel alive
To make me feel alive

501
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:58,915
Yeah, waitin' for a girl like you
Yeah, waitin' for a boy like you

502
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,753
To come into my
To come into my

503
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:08,258
Life
Life

504
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,399
Wait.

505
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:29,154
What?
You're gonna sing me a song.

506
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,073
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, I can't.
Ha, ha.

507
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,407
DREW:
Sherrie.

508
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,785
SHERRIE: You are gonna sing
whether you like it or not.

509
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:36,286
Now, breathe!
Hey.

510
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,038
Don't be nervous.

511
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,873
 

512
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,919
Okay, uh....

513
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:50,300
This is something I kind of started
working on after we met last night.

514
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,303
 

515
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,972
DREW  :
Just a small-town girl

516
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,519
Livin' in a lonely world

517
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:07,818
She took the midnight train goin'
Anywhere

518
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,948
A singer in a smoky room

519
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,077
The smell of wine and cheap perfume

520
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,497
For a smile they can share the night

521
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,584
And it goes on and on and on.

522
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,505
Heh. I love it.

523
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:33,009
It's so beautiful.
I can't believe you wrote that.

524
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,095
How'd it feel?

525
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,431
Uh....

526
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,016
The breathing really helps.

527
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,568
 
Just a small town girl

528
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,697
Mmm, lonely world

529
00:33:55,533 --> 00:34:00,704
She took the midnight train
Going anywhere

530
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,291
It was actually a bus...

531
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,918
...but I think train sounds better.

532
00:34:09,046 --> 00:34:11,423
What sounds better is you singing it.

533
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,301
Really?

534
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,303
You like me singing?

535
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:21,016
It's one of the most beautiful voices
I've ever heard.

536
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,271
 

537
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,899
 

538
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,368
DREW:
There you go!

539
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,829
 

540
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,706
SHERRIE: Come on!
DREW: No, no, no.

541
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,674
 

542
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,844
You have to go back to work.

543
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:01,807
Oh, like, now. Okay.

544
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:05,101
Right, right. Yep. You got that?

545
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:09,481
 

546
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,241
 

547
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,787
WOMAN:
God hates rock 'n' roll!

548
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,790
MAN 1: Go back to church!
MAN 2: Get off the Strip already!

549
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,292
Okay. Okay. Okay.

550
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:33,046
Shit. Our opener just dropped out.
Concrete Ballz?

551
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,131
In rehab. There are six.
Both of them?

552
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,635
Jesus, that band's got a lot of balls.
Betty Ford has a group rate.

553
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,388
Think they'll do therapy in pairs?
Knock it off.

554
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,140
Look, we have to find an opener
in the next two hours.

555
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,185
Don't stress, man.
We'll work this out together.

556
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,687
What about you?
Yeah, right.

557
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,313
Why not?
Not gonna happen.

558
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,315
Are you kidding me?
Sherrie!

559
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,692
What about Drew?

560
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,569
Drool are very expensive.

561
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,654
Not Drool. Drew.

562
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,865
What?

563
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,409
Drew? That Drew? Our Drew?

564
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,828
He's better than Concrete Ballz.
LONNY: Good point.

565
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,873
Concrete Ballz are very heavy.
And he'll do it for free.

566
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:09,416
DENNIS:
Baby, baby, baby.

567
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,002
Come on, nobody cares
about the opening act anyway.

568
00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:13,503
No offense.
None taken.

569
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,339
Dennis, come on. What do you say?

570
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,104
Okay.

571
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,856
Call your band.

572
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,568
Guys! Guys!
We're opening up for Arsenal.

573
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,528
 

574
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,366
Doesn't anyone just wanna work
in the bar industry anymore?

575
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,620
DREW: Dennis. Thank you.
You're welcome.

576
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,623
We're gonna blow you away.
You're gonna blow me, all right.

577
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:54,085
Three songs. No covers. I need you guys
to be amazing tonight so start drinking...

578
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,420
...now.

579
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,508
I love you--
Shh!

580
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:05,221
Just go up there and kill it.
You're gonna be amazing. Go!

581
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,265
Go! Go.

582
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,893
Go on!

583
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,397
WAITRESS:
Well, kiss him goodbye.

584
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,066
SHERRIE:
What do you mean?

585
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:18,944
The spotlight doesn't just light them up.

586
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,029
It makes us disappear.

587
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,197
You'll see.

588
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:37,921
 
Sayin'"I love you"

589
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:44,094
Is not the words
I want to hear from you

590
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:48,390
It's not that I want you

591
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:54,813
Not to say, but if you only knew

592
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,775
How easy

593
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:05,448
It would be to show me how you feel

594
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,994
More than words

595
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:12,205
Is all you'd have to do

596
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,792
To make it real

597
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:20,964
Then you wouldn't have to say

598
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,676
That you love me

599
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:31,474
'Cause I'd already know

600
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,478
SHERRIE: Hey, I'm gonna take my break.
Okay.

601
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,859
Excuse me, sunshine.

602
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,527
 

603
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,112
Testing. Testing.

604
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,492
I have an adequately sized,
uncircumcised penis.

605
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,537
Penis. Penis.

606
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,040
And smashing set of balls.
Okay, I think--

607
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:59,377
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Say again, whoa!

608
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,671
What are you doing?

609
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,507
The mike's not prepped yet.

610
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,606
Right. Now it's ready.

611
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,816
Thanks.

612
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,109
Cowboys.

613
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,576
 

614
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,038
Sorry, guys.

615
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,048
Drew...

616
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,053
...I can see you're nervous.

617
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,680
Pretend like nobody's watching you.

618
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:57,644
You know? Connect with something powerful
and emotive deep down.

619
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,980
In my case, that's Little Lonny.

620
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,733
In your case,
it might be something different.

621
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:08,196
Just imagine yourself completely alone
with something that you love.

622
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,574
Okay.

623
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,884
 
How I love the way you move

624
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:33,721
And the sparkle in your eyes

625
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:37,600
There's a color deep inside them

626
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,728
Like a blue suburban sky

627
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:46,192
I don't need to be the king of the world

628
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,362
As long as I'm the hero

629
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:57,579
Of this little girl
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

630
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:02,917
Heaven isn't too far away
Heaven isn't too far away

631
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:09,090
Closer to it every day
Closer to it every day

632
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:12,552
No matter what your friends say

633
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,099
I know we're gonna find a way
More than words

634
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:26,107
Is all you have to do to make it real
You have to do to make it real

635
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:30,612
Then you wouldn't have to say
Then you wouldn't have to say

636
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:35,575
Heaven isn't too far away
Heaven isn't too far away

637
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:39,621
Heaven isn't too far away

638
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,748
More than words

639
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,585
Yeah, heaven isn't too far away

640
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:52,133
SHERRIE:
More than words

641
00:41:54,136 --> 00:42:01,142
'Cause I'd already

642
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,645
Know

643
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:08,942
DREW:
Sayin'"I love you"

644
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:16,282
You beautiful bastard.

645
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,041
 

646
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,419
 

647
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,396
 

648
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,357
WOMAN:
Stacee!

649
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,692
Stacee!

650
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,318
 

651
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,071
Everybody, listen up!

652
00:42:55,656 --> 00:43:00,410
This place is about to become a sea
of sweat, ear-shattering music and puke.

653
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:01,703
So let's get moving.

654
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,249
Paul! Ha-ha.

655
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,335
You're early.

656
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:13,923
Actually, I told him the gig was last night,
so technically he's a day late. Don't tell him.

657
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,341
 

658
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,551
Work, work, work.

659
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,678
Yes, you're on the air.

660
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,346
 

661
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,781
Hey, Stacee, you made it.

662
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,033
Hey Man.

663
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,201
Yeah. Hey, man.

664
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,538
No, this...

665
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,582
...is Hey Man.

666
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,876
DENNIS:
Oh. Uh....

667
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,627
Right.

668
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,630
Hey Man.

669
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,549
Whoa! Whoa!

670
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:00,219
Thank you so much for doing this....

671
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,721
You and me.

672
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,807
Uh-huh.

673
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,726
You and me.

674
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,397
We're sole survivors.

675
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:18,279
Even the cockroaches got burned
by the fallout, but not us.

676
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,743
It's great to see your face-bone again.

677
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,087
Now let's burn this place to the ground.
Yes.

678
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,589
Right on, brother. Rock 'n' roll.

679
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:42,178
No. When I'm done, we literally need
to burn this place to the ground.

680
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,641
Otherwise the fire phoenix gets trapped.

681
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,271
Yes, I suppose so.

682
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,403
Ha-ha. It's a joke. I'm kidding, man.

683
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,781
 

684
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:05,868
I mean, of course, you're not really gonna
burn the place down to the ground, right?

685
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:07,954
No.

686
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,791
You can't trap a fire phoenix.

687
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,629
I mean, that'd be crazy, right?

688
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,800
It would be. Yeah.

689
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,010
I mean, seriously...

690
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:27,473
...tonight, I am gonna light
this place on fire...

691
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:28,975
...for you...

692
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:32,145
...my rock 'n' roll brother.

693
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,535
SHERRIE: Uhn.
Sherrie!

694
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:54,333
Sherrie. Sherrie.

695
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,173
You okay?
Ow.

696
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,718
What happened?
You passed out.

697
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:09,765
I saw Stacee Jaxx. Oh, my God.
I'm so embarrassed. Oh, my Go--

698
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:13,561
It's okay. I'm sure girls
faint around him all the time.

699
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:19,358
They're gonna be fainting
around you too in no time.

700
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,113
 

701
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,615
 

702
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,159
 

703
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,173
Here we go.

704
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:47,345
Hey, Stacee. I got someone
I'd like you to meet, man.

705
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:50,681
This is Constance Sack. Rolling Stone.

706
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,185
Stace?

707
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,353
 

708
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,813
You in there, man? Ha-ha-ha.

709
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,399
Say, superstar, rise and shine.

710
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,277
Constance Sack. Rolling Stone.

711
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:04,946
STACEE:
Stones.

712
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,365
Good.
STACEE: The Rolling Stones?

713
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,376
Where's Mick?

714
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,878
 

715
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,548
No. The magazine.

716
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,800
She's a reporter.

717
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:30,721
She's here to do the big story about
you going solo, brother.

718
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,432
Paul, I--
Okay.

719
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,561
Look, Paul, I--
Hey, hey.

720
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,896
Be yourself.

721
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,774
Superstar, right? Okay, you know what?

722
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:45,861
I'm gonna leave you two alone,
go return some phone calls.

723
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,655
Play nice!

724
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,573
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

725
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:51,075
 

726
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,703
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
I love you, Stacee Jaxx!

727
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,226
No! I love you! I love you!

728
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,945
STACEE:
Okay.

729
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,947
Five minutes.
Fi--?

730
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,783
Oh, God. Okay.

731
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:37,955
Five minutes and go.

732
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,082
Okay. Stacee Jaxx,
back at The Bourbon--

733
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,917
No, no, no. No.

734
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:43,586
Now go.

735
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,674
Uh-- At The Bourbon, where it all started.

736
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:53,471
Your first album Stick Meat gave birth
to some of rock's greatest anthems.

737
00:48:53,638 --> 00:48:55,931
And now a solo career. Why now?

738
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,433
Well, ahem...

739
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,477
...I think....

740
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,983
I think due to the changing nature
of the music industry...

741
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:09,445
...the change in cultural trends...

742
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:13,157
...and when you think of
blah-blah-blah and blah-blah-blah.

743
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:19,163
-you make sure that you wanna take in
blah-blah-blah. Ha-ha.

744
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,624
Okay.
Four minutes.

745
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,042
 

746
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:28,047
You know, some people have said that
you've become quite difficult to work with.

747
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:32,176
That you're constantly late, you're
reclusive, sometimes even nonsensical.

748
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,595
I wanna ask you this:

749
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:40,101
Have these people even met themselves?

750
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,856
Well, I'm talking about your band.

751
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,488
Let me tell you something.

752
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:55,950
I know me better than anyone...

753
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:59,036
...because I live in here.

754
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,500
Eight minutes.
You just said four.

755
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,504
Three.
But it--

756
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,927
Do you think that it's possible...

757
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,721
...that you've shut out or alienated
so many people...

758
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,433
...that you had no other option
but to go solo?

759
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,735
You gotta be true to the muse. Hey Man.

760
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,321
Scotch me, little buddy.

761
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,875
And who is your muse? Ahem.

762
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:50,129
Right.

763
00:50:54,759 --> 00:50:56,218
Fine.

764
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,888
Born Steven Jackson in Detroit, Michigan.
Are we out?

765
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,891
Raised by a single mom, Doris,
now deceased.

766
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:04,727
Dropped out of Woodrow Wilson High
in 11th grade.

767
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,937
Your first concert was Aerosmith.

768
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:11,775
When you were 17, you hitchhiked to L.A.
with your high school sweetheart.

769
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:15,738
Remember her?

770
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,870
No comment?

771
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,624
Hmm?

772
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,127
Two minutes.

773
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,546
Did I hit a nerve?

774
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,801
Aerosmith? Detroit?

775
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,262
High school sweetheart?

776
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:46,268
Jenny Anderson. Your first love.

777
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:52,733
And your last hit single,"I'm gonna rock you
in your mouth," it was written about her.

778
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,490
Record sold 100 million copies.

779
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:05,287
And that record
was produced about eight years ago.

780
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,206
Some people say
you've sold out since then.

781
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:15,214
I sell out all right.
Every seat, every stadium I ever play.

782
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:19,885
Yeah, and yet, creatively,
you've come to a standstill.

783
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,472
You've been in and out of the studio
for the past, what? Two years?

784
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,058
And no results. Nothing.

785
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,287
Time.

786
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,583
You know, you're not so weird.

787
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,085
You're just another lonely man
with many regrets.

788
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,047
I said time. You can go now.

789
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,718
Final question.

790
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:05,389
What happens when you realize
you can't get rid of Stacee Jaxx?

791
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:14,231
You have no idea what it's like to be me.

792
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,568
Well, then here's your chance.

793
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:22,072
What's it like to be the Stacee Jaxx?

794
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:40,090
 
It's all the same

795
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:44,219
Only the names will change

796
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:50,267
Every day it seems we're wastin' away

797
00:53:50,935 --> 00:53:52,519
Another place

798
00:53:53,938 --> 00:53:56,732
Where the faces are so cold

799
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:03,280
I drive all night just to get back home

800
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,991
I'm a cowboy

801
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,495
On a steel horse I ride

802
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,789
I'm wanted

803
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:16,627
Dead or alive

804
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:17,961
Wanted

805
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:22,966
Dead or alive

806
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,058
Sometimes I sleep

807
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:35,562
Sometimes it's not for days

808
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,398
The people I meet

809
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:41,360
Always go their separate ways

810
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,655
Sometimes you tell the day

811
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:47,658
By the bottle that you drink

812
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,161
And times when you're alone

813
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,706
All you do is think

814
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:54,915
Dalai Lama.

815
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,208
I'm a cowboy

816
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,671
On a steel horse I ride

817
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:02,339
I'm wanted

818
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:03,882
BOTH  :
Wanted

819
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:07,010
STACEE:
Dead or alive

820
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:08,846
Wanted

821
00:55:09,013 --> 00:55:10,723
ALL:
Wanted

822
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:17,688
Dead or alive

823
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,106
 

824
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,737
CROWD  :
Stacee! Stacee! Stacee! Stacee! Stacee!

825
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:28,031
Oh, and I ride

826
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:31,326
CROWD  :
Stacee! Stacee! Stacee!

827
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,706
 

828
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:41,336
Oh, when I walk these streets

829
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:45,048
A loaded six string on my back

830
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,384
I play for keeps

831
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,221
'Cause I might not make it back

832
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:54,767
I've been everywhere

833
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:57,644
Still standing tall

834
00:55:58,062 --> 00:56:00,564
I've seen a million faces

835
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,859
And I've rocked them all

836
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,903
I'm a cowboy

837
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:10,240
On a steel horse I ride

838
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,242
I'm wanted

839
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,911
Wanted

840
00:56:14,078 --> 00:56:18,123
Dead or alive

841
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,958
Well, I'm a cowboy

842
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:24,254
I got the night on my side

843
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:26,089
I'm wanted

844
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:28,175
Wanted

845
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:30,177
Dead or alive

846
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:34,139
And I ride

847
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:36,517
Dead or alive

848
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:40,312
I still drive

849
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:49,154
Dead or alive
Dead or alive

850
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,633
I'm Stacee.

851
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:14,638
Sherrie.

852
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,142
When my hamster died...

853
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:22,145
...your music really helped me through.

854
00:57:32,448 --> 00:57:33,824
 

855
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,826
You have such a perky...

856
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,581
...heart.

857
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,667
Thank you.

858
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,673
 

859
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,227
Do me a favor.

860
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,104
Sure.

861
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:07,691
There's a cut-glass bottle of Scotch
in the limo.

862
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,695
Bring it to my dressing room?

863
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,953
Right away.

864
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:22,581
DREW:
Sherrie.

865
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:27,920
Where were you?
I just met Stacee again.

866
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,212
And I didn't even faint.

867
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:32,174
Wait, wait. Where are you going?

868
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,176
I gotta go grab something for Stacee.

869
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,471
Wait. I want you to be here when I go on.

870
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,972
Oh, yeah, of course.

871
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:45,270
Now, Patricia, this is the third night
in a row that you've been here.

872
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:49,942
Why so passionate?
Well, Mitch, this has to end.

873
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:54,154
We're calling on anyone with children
to join forces with us...

874
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,782
...and show up here every night...

875
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:00,535
...until the doors of these places
are closed for good.

876
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,664
Stacee Jaxx can wreck his own life.

877
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:07,125
But when it comes to raping...

878
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:11,838
...the ears of our children
with this poison...

879
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,132
...we have to fight!
Well, they--

880
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,510
Rock 'n' roll is the only freedom
we have.

881
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,178
Stacee Jaxx is God!

882
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:22,307
Rock 'n' roll forever! Waah!

883
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:26,603
Sniff the mike. Whoo!

884
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,815
I'm walking here! Whoo!

885
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,609
PAUL: Okay, great interview.
I hope you got everything.

886
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:35,320
You're not a cowboy.
Why don't you tell me what I am?

887
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:38,740
You're a man-child stuck in a rut.
I love it when you talk dirty.

888
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:42,160
You used to be great. But whatever
made you that way, it's gone.

889
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:43,996
That's right. Give it to me rough.

890
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:46,206
You're another rocker
asleep at the wheel...

891
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:49,668
...singing songs you wrote 10 years ago.
Okay, lady.

892
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,838
As long as you've got this manager
keeping you on the road...

893
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:56,675
...and doping you up with girls and booze
and million-dollar record deals...

894
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:59,761
...he's gonna keep you asleep
and drive your career off a cliff.

895
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,514
Line crossed. Let's go, sweetheart.
Don't touch me.

896
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:05,434
You used to write great songs.
Where are they now?

897
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:09,354
PAUL: You know what? I'm calling your editor.
Close friend of mine, by the way.

898
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:11,690
WOMAN  : Rolling Stone magazine.
Jann Wenner's office.

899
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:12,983
Get out.

900
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,986
My words exactly.
This interview is over.

901
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,696
No, no, no. Not her.

902
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:20,866
You.

903
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,038
All of you.

904
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,292
Copy that. Everybody out.

905
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,012
No, no, no.

906
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,889
Not you too, Hey Man.

907
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,558
We'll do the next one together, all right?

908
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,477
All right?

909
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,980
Come on, don't be like that.
We'll do the next one together.

910
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,066
I promise. Okay?

911
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,496
 

912
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,920
You know, I think you get
this sense of entitlement...

913
01:01:15,087 --> 01:01:17,881
...due to the fact that you're a rock god.

914
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,258
But it's not real.

915
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,512
It's not love.

916
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,263
No.

917
01:01:26,682 --> 01:01:28,433
It's not love.

918
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,520
Then what is it?

919
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,815
Off the record?

920
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:39,820
Sex.

921
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,197
 

922
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:47,077
And other people's projections
of what they want me to be.

923
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:51,706
Of what you and all your readers
want me to be.

924
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:53,959
Sex.

925
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:01,091
And it keeps me from going out...

926
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,928
...and getting the one thing
that could save me.

927
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:15,355
But I can't have that now.

928
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:20,443
I'm a slave to rock 'n' roll.

929
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,492
I am searching for the perfect song...

930
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:32,497
...the perfect sound that will
make you wanna live forever.

931
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,749
Like I said:

932
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:38,837
I know me better than anyone
because I live in here.

933
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,423
And no one else can.

934
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:49,764
I can.

935
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,860
 
I gotta take a little time

936
01:03:03,487 --> 01:03:07,282
A little time to think things over

937
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:15,290
I better read between the lines

938
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:20,629
In case I need it when I'm older

939
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:30,889
 
Ooh, ahh, ahh

940
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:33,516
In my life

941
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,978
There's been heartache and pain

942
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:39,648
I don't know

943
01:03:39,815 --> 01:03:43,234
If I can face it again

944
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:48,907
Can't stop now
I've traveled so far

945
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:55,872
To change this lonely life

946
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,751
I wanna know what love is
I wanna know what love is

947
01:04:02,254 --> 01:04:05,882
I want you to show me
I want you to show me

948
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:11,262
I wanna feel what love is
I wanna feel what love is

949
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:19,521
I know you can show me
I know you can show me

950
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:23,108
 

951
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:31,366
I'm gonna take a little time

952
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:37,038
A little time to look around me

953
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:41,418
CONSTANCE:
I've got nowhere left to hide

954
01:04:42,878 --> 01:04:47,048
It looks like love has finally found me

955
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:50,969
In my life

956
01:04:51,595 --> 01:04:54,639
There's been heartache and pain

957
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,142
I don't know

958
01:04:57,309 --> 01:05:00,770
If I can face it again

959
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,148
I can't stop now

960
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:06,484
Hey, man, have you seen Sherrie? Blon--?

961
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,654
LONNY:
Drew? Hey, Drew, showtime.

962
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:11,614
Come on. Stop fannying around.

963
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:13,658
Let's talk about love

964
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:16,494
I wanna know what love is

965
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:19,789
Love that you feel inside

966
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:22,751
I want you to show me

967
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:25,336
I'm feelin' so much love

968
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:28,173
I wanna feel what love is

969
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:29,424

Broken hearts

You might even find it. Heh, heh.

01:15:18,513 --> 01:15:20,431
Why is everybody quitting today?

1136
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:24,435
Who cares?
This is the greatest night of my life!

1137
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:28,356
You got the peaches
I got the cream

1138
01:15:28,523 --> 01:15:30,775
Sweet to taste
Saccharine

1139
01:15:30,942 --> 01:15:33,444
'Cause I'm hot, say what
Sticky sweet

1140
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:36,947
From my head
My head to my feet

1141
01:15:37,949 --> 01:15:40,117
Do you take sugar

1142
01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:42,453
One lump or two

1143
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:45,373
ARSENAL: Take a bottle
STACEE: Take a bottle

1144
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:48,084
ARSENAL: Shake it up
STACEE: Shake it up

1145
01:15:48,251 --> 01:15:50,920
ARSENAL: Break the bubble
Break it up

1146
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:52,713
ARSENAL:
Break it up

1147
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,633
ARSENAL & CROWD:
Pour some sugar on me

1148
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,593
Ooh
In the name of love

1149
01:15:57,761 --> 01:15:59,095
Hey, man.

1150
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:01,889
Did you give my offer some thought?

1151
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:03,724
STACEE:
C'mon, fire me up

1152
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:06,394
ARSENAL & CROWD:
Pour your sugar on me

1153
01:16:08,146 --> 01:16:09,313
We got a deal.

1154
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:11,899
Pour some sugar on me

1155
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,819
Ha-ha. That's my man!

1156
01:16:14,986 --> 01:16:17,822
ARSENAL & CROWD:
Pour some sugar on me

1157
01:16:17,989 --> 01:16:19,907
Get it
Come get it

1158
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:23,077
ARSENAL & CROWD:
Pour your sugar on me

1159
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,246
Ooh

1160
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:28,499
ARSENAL & CROWD:
Pour some sugar on me

1161
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:29,834
 

1162
01:16:30,001 --> 01:16:31,210
Sugar me

1163
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:33,254
 

1164
01:16:49,646 --> 01:16:50,855
 

1165
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:54,650
Thirty-one thousand,
two hundred and three dollars.

1166
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:56,318
Crisis averted.

1167
01:16:56,486 --> 01:16:58,154
Thank you, Stacee Jaxx.

1168
01:16:58,321 --> 01:17:01,031
And Stacee Jaxx thanks you.

1169
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:03,534
Well, hello, Paul.
Well, hello, Dennis. Lonny.

1170
01:17:03,827 --> 01:17:05,536
Now, hold on just a second.

1171
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:08,497
We got 90 percent of the house,
20 percent of the bar...

1172
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,041
...100 percent of the merch.

1173
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:14,003
That means that Stacee's take
works out to about....

1174
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:16,380
Wait, wait, wait."Stacee's take"?

1175
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:19,925
Hold on. Add a zero. Add three.

1176
01:17:21,928 --> 01:17:23,220
 

1177
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:26,891
Thirty-one thousand,
two hundred and nine. Correct?

1178
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:28,517
Yeah.
Crap.

1179
01:17:28,685 --> 01:17:30,019
Crap. We got a problem.

1180
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,688
What problem?
Well, you owe me six bucks.

1181
01:17:32,856 --> 01:17:36,734
Ha-ha-ha. But screw it. Keep it.
I get fussy about singles anyway.

1182
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:39,195
Paul, you told me this was a freebie.

1183
01:17:39,362 --> 01:17:43,866
Stacee Jaxx does not take a dump for free.
He took a huge pay cut on this.

1184
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:45,743
You are cutting my throat here!

1185
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:49,288
Don't be so pessimistic.
Stacee just put you guys back on the map!

1186
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:52,041
No, no. I put him on the map.

1187
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:55,044
 

1188
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:56,253
I beg your pardon.

1189
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:58,255
I gave him his first gig.

1190
01:17:58,423 --> 01:18:01,008
And I gave him his first million.

1191
01:18:03,094 --> 01:18:06,847
Anyway.
Awesome doing business with you, ciao!

1192
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:11,644
Didn't know Paul spoke Italian.

1193
01:18:15,398 --> 01:18:16,941
 

1194
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:25,825
  Cryin' on the corner
Waitin' in the rain

1195
01:18:25,992 --> 01:18:30,287
I swear I'll never, ever wait again

1196
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:31,956
You gave me your word

1197
01:18:32,123 --> 01:18:36,210
But words for you are lies

1198
01:18:37,629 --> 01:18:40,965
Darlin', in my wildest dreams

1199
01:18:41,132 --> 01:18:46,303
I never thought I'd go

1200
01:18:46,471 --> 01:18:51,475
But it's time to let you know

1201
01:18:52,143 --> 01:18:55,312
I'm gonna harden my heart

1202
01:18:55,522 --> 01:18:59,275
I'm gonna swallow my tears

1203
01:18:59,442 --> 01:19:05,531
I'm gonna turn and leave you here

1204
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:10,619
All of my life I've been waitin' in the rain

1205
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:14,665
I've been waiting for a feeling
That never, ever came

1206
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:16,625
It feels so close

1207
01:19:16,793 --> 01:19:18,752
But always disappears

1208
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,588
MAN:
Watch it.

1209
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:25,509
 

1210
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:35,978
WOMAN  :
Oh, oh, oh

1211
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:39,982
Mm, mm, ah, ah
Oh

1212
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:44,570
Darlin', in your wildest dreams

1213
01:19:45,071 --> 01:19:50,576
You never had a clue

1214
01:19:51,453 --> 01:20:00,377
But it's time you got the news

1215
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:04,214
I'm gonna harden my heart

1216
01:20:04,382 --> 01:20:06,550
Harden your heart

1217
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:08,886
I'm gonna swallow my tears

1218
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:12,723
Swallow your tears, girl

1219
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:14,516
I'm gonna turn
Turn

1220
01:20:14,684 --> 01:20:21,690
And leave you here
Leave you here

1221
01:20:31,534 --> 01:20:33,535
 

1222
01:20:33,703 --> 01:20:36,705


1223
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:41,710
 
Oh, like a candle

1224
01:20:41,878 --> 01:20:43,587
Cognac, brandy.

1225
01:20:43,755 --> 01:20:46,006
Oh, no, I don't mix my drinks.
No, no, no.

1226
01:20:47,133 --> 01:20:48,634
This is Cognac.

1227
01:20:49,052 --> 01:20:51,470
She's getting you a brandy.
COGNAC: Here you go, Justice.

1228
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:54,264
Thank you.
Now you drink up and dry off.

1229
01:20:54,432 --> 01:20:55,724
But remember:

1230
01:20:55,892 --> 01:20:58,102
This is just a rest stop.

1231
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:00,396
I need a job.

1232
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,274
Do you dance?

1233
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:07,444
You got the best of me

1234
01:21:07,612 --> 01:21:08,904
I'm a better singer.

1235
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:10,447
I don't need a singer.

1236
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:14,326
And you're a pretty girl. You wanna
make some real money, you gotta dance.

1237
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:18,038
You also have to be tough too.
And you don't look too tough to me.

1238
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:20,916
I'm tough.

1239
01:21:21,084 --> 01:21:23,127
It's not right for everyone, honey.

1240
01:21:23,294 --> 01:21:25,045
Hey there.

1241
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:26,964
I can wait tables. I'm good.

1242
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:28,173
Are you sure?

1243
01:21:28,341 --> 01:21:34,096
You're bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see

1244
01:21:34,305 --> 01:21:36,682
Okay. You start tomorrow.

1245
01:21:38,268 --> 01:21:43,022
  You said,"Oh, girl
It's a cold world

1246
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:46,775
When you keep it all to yourself"

1247
01:21:47,944 --> 01:21:52,823
I said,"You can't hide
On the inside

1248
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:57,077
All the pain you've ever felt"

1249
01:21:57,495 --> 01:22:02,332
You better ransom your heart
And, baby, don't look back

1250
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,878
'Cause we got nobody else

1251
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:09,339
We're running with the shadows
Of the night

1252
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:13,385
So, baby, take my hand
It'll be all right

1253
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:16,847
Surrender all your dreams to me tonight

1254
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:20,350
They'll come true in the end

1255
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:39,328
I'm gonna harden my heart

1256
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:43,499
Harden your heart, girl
SHERRIE: I'm gonna swallow my tears

1257
01:22:43,666 --> 01:22:44,875
Swallow your tears

1258
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:49,171
I'm gonna turn and leave you

1259
01:22:49,339 --> 01:22:52,841
Darlin', in my wildest dreams

1260
01:22:53,009 --> 01:22:58,055
I never thought I'd go

1261
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:02,226
But it's time to let you know

1262
01:23:02,685 --> 01:23:07,397
Oh, I'm gonna harden my heart

1263
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:11,443
I'm gonna swallow my tears

1264
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:22,371
I'm gonna turn and leave you here

1265
01:23:26,709 --> 01:23:27,751
PATRICIA:
Whitty.

1266
01:23:27,919 --> 01:23:31,255
What if I told you The Bourbon Room
hadn't paid taxes in over a year?

1267
01:23:31,422 --> 01:23:33,715
Why do you ask?
Because it's true.

1268
01:23:33,883 --> 01:23:37,636
They're broke. I am so excited.

1269
01:23:37,804 --> 01:23:39,221
I'm gonna call the press.

1270
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,307
 

1271
01:23:42,934 --> 01:23:44,101
Patty-cakes?
Mm-hm.

1272
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:46,937
I think this whole
"Cleaning up the Strip" thing...

1273
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:49,731
...is gonna be great for the city
and for us.

1274
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:55,696
But you seem to have this issue
with Stacee Jaxx.

1275
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:59,199
I mean, it seems to be really intense.

1276
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:01,285
Well....

1277
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,454
The short answer?
Mm-hm.

1278
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:10,711
When I was a naive undergrad at UCLA,
I had a roommate.

1279
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:14,381
Let's just call her Vivian.
Oh.

1280
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:19,720
One night she was partying innocently
at The Bourbon Room...

1281
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:22,931
...when that two-headed monster
spotted her...

1282
01:24:23,099 --> 01:24:26,852
...and lured her into his suite
at the Park Hyatt.

1283
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:29,479
What?
For the first time...

1284
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:31,982
...she felt like a woman.

1285
01:24:32,525 --> 01:24:37,654
Sure, a handcuffed woman covered in
Cool Whip and Wild Turkey, but still...

1286
01:24:38,781 --> 01:24:40,324
...a woman.

1287
01:24:40,491 --> 01:24:42,492
Yeah. A woman.

1288
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:46,121
Well, you can guess what happened next.
Oh.

1289
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:50,459
His tour bus left L.A.,
taking Stacee Jaxx with it.

1290
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:53,670
And I swore in her honor...

1291
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:55,964
...that I would see him...

1292
01:24:56,507 --> 01:25:00,177
...and his sick satanic legacy gone
for good.

1293
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:05,474
That's the short answer?

1294
01:25:06,392 --> 01:25:07,643
Yeah.

1295
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:19,321
 
I don't know where I'm going

1296
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:25,285
But I sure know where I've been

1297
01:25:26,412 --> 01:25:31,333
Hanging on the promises
In the songs of yesterday

1298
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:35,545
And I've made up my mind

1299
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:40,217
I ain't wasting no more time

1300
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:43,720
But here I go again

1301
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:49,601
Here I go again

1302
01:25:53,731 --> 01:25:57,067
Though I keep searching for an answer

1303
01:25:58,611 --> 01:26:02,572
I never seem to find what I'm looking for

1304
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:08,745
Oh, Lord, I pray
You give me strength to carry on

1305
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:14,251
'Cause I know what it means

1306
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:18,588
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

1307
01:26:19,549 --> 01:26:23,427
And here I go again on my own

1308
01:26:24,595 --> 01:26:28,557
Going down the only road I've ever known

1309
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:34,104
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone

1310
01:26:36,774 --> 01:26:39,443
And I've made up my mind

1311
01:26:40,987 --> 01:26:44,281
I ain't wasting no more time

1312
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:49,745
I'm just another heart in need of rescue

1313
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:55,250
Waitin' on love's sweet charity

1314
01:26:56,794 --> 01:27:01,173
And I'm gonna hold on
For the rest of my days

1315
01:27:02,258 --> 01:27:05,635
'Cause I know what it means

1316
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:10,515
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

1317
01:27:11,642 --> 01:27:15,395
And here I go again on my own

1318
01:27:16,689 --> 01:27:19,900
Going down the only road I've ever known

1319
01:27:21,944 --> 01:27:25,447
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone

1320
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:31,495
And I've made up my mind

1321
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:33,789
 

1322
01:27:33,956 --> 01:27:36,333
I ain't wasting no more time

1323
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:39,169
But here I go again

1324
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:41,380
JUSTICE:
Oh, here I go

1325
01:27:41,547 --> 01:27:43,465
Here I go again

1326
01:27:43,716 --> 01:27:46,676
JUSTICE:
Here I go

1327
01:27:47,011 --> 01:27:49,179
Here I go again

1328
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:52,182
JUSTICE: Here I go
Here I go

1329
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:56,311
Here I go

1330
01:27:56,479 --> 01:28:01,691
JUSTICE:
Here I go

1331
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:24,965
 

1332
01:28:26,008 --> 01:28:29,177
Hey. Come on, big fella.
We can sort this out.

1333
01:28:29,512 --> 01:28:32,055
What part of"We're screwed"
don't you understand?

1334
01:28:32,223 --> 01:28:35,392
What part of"Rock 'n' roll is forever"
don't you understand?

1335
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,519
This monument to decadence...

1336
01:28:37,687 --> 01:28:41,189
...can't be brought down by a few
plastic bureaucrats in bowler hats.

1337
01:28:41,357 --> 01:28:42,732
It's eternal.

1338
01:28:44,068 --> 01:28:46,403
I just feel like I've let everyone down.

1339
01:28:56,747 --> 01:28:58,248
Not everyone.

1340
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:03,920
What do you mean?

1341
01:29:11,262 --> 01:29:15,515
 
I can't fight this feeling any longer

1342
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:21,771
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow

1343
01:29:22,773 --> 01:29:28,111
What started out as friendship
Has grown stronger

1344
01:29:28,779 --> 01:29:33,283
I only wish I had the strength
To let it show

1345
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:38,914
I tell myself that I can't hold out forever

1346
01:29:39,081 --> 01:29:40,957
You're not fucking with me, are you?

1347
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:44,920
I said there is no reason for my fear

1348
01:29:45,087 --> 01:29:46,671
This is a dream come true.

1349
01:29:47,131 --> 01:29:52,177
'Cause I feel so secure
When we're together

1350
01:29:53,137 --> 01:29:55,305
You give my life direction

1351
01:29:55,640 --> 01:30:00,352
You make everything so clear

1352
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:03,480
And even as I wander

1353
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,941
I'm keeping you in sight

1354
01:30:06,317 --> 01:30:09,027
You're a candle in the window

1355
01:30:09,195 --> 01:30:12,155
On a cold, dark winter's night

1356
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:14,824
And I'm getting closer
And I'm getting closer

1357
01:30:14,992 --> 01:30:22,332
Than I ever thought I might
Than I ever thought I might

1358
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:28,672
And I can't fight this feeling anymore
And I can't fight this feeling anymore

1359
01:30:28,839 --> 01:30:34,844
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
I've forgotten what I started fighting for

1360
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:38,932
It's time to bring this ship into the shore

1361
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:44,980
And throw away the oars forever

1362
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:52,487
'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore

1363
01:30:52,863 --> 01:30:58,410
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
I've forgotten what I started fighting for

1364
01:30:59,036 --> 01:31:02,706
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
And if I have to crawl upon the floor

1365
01:31:03,374 --> 01:31:05,834
Come crashing through your door

1366
01:31:06,377 --> 01:31:13,008
Baby, I can't fight this feelin' anymore
Baby, I can't fight this feelin' anymore

1367
01:31:18,514 --> 01:31:19,764
Hey, boss.

1368
01:31:21,183 --> 01:31:22,225
What is it, Chico?

1369
01:31:22,393 --> 01:31:23,810
The beer guy is here.

1370
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:25,228
DENNIS:
Tell him I'm busy.

1371
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:29,691
Busy falling in love.

1372
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:32,736
 

1373
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:36,698
MAN: Let's go, Donny,
SHERRIE: Hey, you okay?

1374
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:40,410
Oh, that? Don't sweat him.
That's just my ex, Donny.

1375
01:31:40,703 --> 01:31:42,787
Anyway, how you holding up, baby?

1376
01:31:42,955 --> 01:31:45,957
I'd say men are pigs but that'd be
totally unfair to pigs, so....

1377
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:48,793
I gave up a long time ago
trying make men respectable.

1378
01:31:48,961 --> 01:31:52,088
There's only one place
you're gonna get respect in this joint.

1379
01:31:52,465 --> 01:31:54,799
You got to take that stage over there.

1380
01:31:54,967 --> 01:31:56,301
That stage is a pedestal.

1381
01:31:57,094 --> 01:32:00,096
And when you're up there,
you're untouchable.

1382
01:32:00,264 --> 01:32:02,432
And when you're up there,
you can have it....

1383
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:06,061
  Any way you want it
That's the way you need it

1384
01:32:06,228 --> 01:32:07,979
Any way you want it

1385
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:11,274
Take Destiny.

1386
01:32:11,442 --> 01:32:14,194
She loves to laugh
She loves to sing

1387
01:32:15,112 --> 01:32:16,404
She does everything

1388
01:32:17,281 --> 01:32:18,323
And Sapphire.

1389
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:21,076
She loves to move
She loves to groove

1390
01:32:21,744 --> 01:32:23,495
She loves the lovin' things

1391
01:32:25,456 --> 01:32:28,124
All night

1392
01:32:28,584 --> 01:32:29,959
Oh, every night

1393
01:32:30,586 --> 01:32:32,003
There's one motto here.

1394
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:33,505
So hold tight

1395
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:35,965
Hold tight
CHORUS: Baby, hold tight

1396
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:37,634
When it comes to the customer....

1397
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:41,638
She said,"Any way you want it
That's the way you need it

1398
01:32:41,806 --> 01:32:43,473
Any way you want it"

1399
01:32:44,475 --> 01:32:48,687
She said,"Any way you want it
That's the way you need it

Any way you want it"

1401
01:32:54,735 --> 01:32:58,655
PAUL:
Gentlemen, I bring you your next star.

1402
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:04,285
Paul, you know I love you,
but it's a pass.

1403
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:05,912
PAUL:
Shh.

1404
01:33:07,623 --> 01:33:09,666
Rock is dead, but the pop thing's hot.

1405
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:12,168
 
Hold on

1406
01:33:12,336 --> 01:33:17,549
Hold on

1407
01:33:18,175 --> 01:33:19,342
Does he rap?

1408
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:22,345
  Any way you want it

1434
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:35,585
 
You got silky sheets

1435
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:38,087
Baby, put me underneath

1436
01:34:38,255 --> 01:34:42,842
I'm your undercover love

1437

Oh, oh, oh, oh

STEFANO:
Cut! Cut! Cut!

1440
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:56,606
This is the stupidest thing
I've ever done. I can't do it.

1441
01:34:56,774 --> 01:35:00,318
What's your name, Joshy-Z?
I'm trying to make you look cool.

1442
01:35:00,486 --> 01:35:04,405
I want you to look funky fresh.
But you have to not suck the next take.

1443
01:35:04,573 --> 01:35:05,990
Back to one, everyone!

1444

I think we should take five, you know?
STEFANO: First good idea I've had all day.

Take five, everyone!

01:35:13,999 --> 01:35:17,085
PAUL: I'm telling you, this pop-band shit
is where everything is headed.

1448
01:35:17,253 --> 01:35:20,630
Just trust me. You're working
with top, classy talent here.

1449
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:24,634
Paul, I am Wolfgang Von Colt.

1450
01:35:24,802 --> 01:35:27,262
Not Joshy-Z, nor the Z-Guyz.

1451
01:35:27,429 --> 01:35:31,975
No, you are not the Z-Guyz either.
You are the Z-Guyeezz.

1452
01:35:32,142 --> 01:35:34,477
Double the E, double the Z,
double the flavor.

1453
01:35:34,645 --> 01:35:36,646
The"flavor"?
Yes.

1454
01:35:36,814 --> 01:35:38,648
What does Z even stand for?

1455
01:35:39,817 --> 01:35:41,609
Nothing. You're over-thinking it.

1456
01:35:41,777 --> 01:35:45,280
Names that end in Z are very popular
with the 14-to-21 year olds.

1457
01:35:45,656 --> 01:35:48,366
We did a whole focus group on this.
Numbers don't lie.

1458
01:35:48,534 --> 01:35:49,868
I don't want to do it, man.

1459
01:35:50,035 --> 01:35:53,454
I have had it up to here
with your negativity, Joshy-Z.

1460
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:57,333
And you know, Donny-Z and Kevy-Z and--
Joey.

1461
01:35:57,501 --> 01:36:01,004
-Joey-Z, they're not too thrilled either.
Think about them, huh?

1462
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:08,177
Don't you think at least we should do
a gig before we shoot a music video?

1463
01:36:08,345 --> 01:36:09,512
You want a gig? Mm.
Yeah.

1464
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,890
Watch this. Brat.

1465
01:36:12,057 --> 01:36:13,474
 

1466
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:16,769
 

1467
01:36:16,937 --> 01:36:19,981
Bourbon.
PAUL: Oh, Dennis. Paul Gill.

1468
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:23,651
Paul, you got a lot of nerve calling me.

1469
01:36:23,819 --> 01:36:24,986
Okay, okay, okay.

1470
01:36:25,154 --> 01:36:29,824
I was a douche. I get it. But listen close.
I'm gonna make it up to you.

1471
01:36:29,992 --> 01:36:31,034
I'm listening.

1472
01:36:31,201 --> 01:36:34,162
I need The Bourbon tonight.
I will pack the place.

1473
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:37,206
I will get the whole town
to come out for it.

1474
01:36:37,374 --> 01:36:38,708
Who's playing?

1475
01:36:39,251 --> 01:36:40,293
Stacee Jaxx.

1476
01:36:41,670 --> 01:36:45,798
His first solo gig. And I've got a new act
that you are gonna love.

1477
01:36:45,966 --> 01:36:48,968
And this time,
every cent goes to the house.

1478
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:51,387
Every cent.
Every last penny...

1479
01:36:51,555 --> 01:36:55,058
...brother,
of which there will be millions!

1480
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:57,560
 
Do we trust him?

1481
01:37:00,731 --> 01:37:01,898
 
Yes.

1482
01:37:03,859 --> 01:37:04,901
 
Okay, deal.

1483
01:37:06,862 --> 01:37:08,738
PAUL:
You're one lucky son of a gun.

1484
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:10,073
See you tonight.

1485
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:11,658
 

1486
01:37:11,825 --> 01:37:14,285
Louise, call the PR department.
Paul, I need--

1487
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:16,079
Shush. I'm rolling here.

1488
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:20,750
Call the PR department and tell them I
need to buy all the advertising blocks...

1489
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:23,294
...on every drive-time radio station
this afternoon.

1490
01:37:23,462 --> 01:37:27,423
Stacee's Rolling Stone cover.
It hit the newsstands an hour ago.

1491
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:29,759
How bad is it?

1492
01:37:29,927 --> 01:37:31,803
Stacee Jaxx.

1493
01:37:34,556 --> 01:37:35,598
On the phone?

1494
01:37:43,148 --> 01:37:44,691
Oh, my God.

1495
01:37:45,025 --> 01:37:46,317
 

1496
01:37:57,037 --> 01:37:58,079
 

1497
01:37:58,789 --> 01:38:00,039
Hey.

1498
01:38:00,249 --> 01:38:01,457
 

1499
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:02,834
Hey Man.

1500
01:38:03,043 --> 01:38:04,127
 

1501
01:38:04,586 --> 01:38:05,795
Man.

1502
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:11,551
Stace. Seriously--Oh!

1503
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:16,848
Can you please ask Hey Man
to just chill for a second or two, man?

1504
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:21,019
Yes, I'm on that. Don't worry about it.

1505
01:38:21,186 --> 01:38:24,897
I just tore the editors a new one.
You should've heard me, man. Ho, ho, ho.

1506
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:28,985
Shit!
Page 68, second paragraph.

1507
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,780
Read.
Okay.

1508
01:38:32,948 --> 01:38:33,990
 

1509
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:35,324
 

1510
01:38:35,492 --> 01:38:36,868
 

1511
01:38:38,037 --> 01:38:39,245
Okay.

1512
01:38:41,123 --> 01:38:42,540
Ah....

1513
01:38:44,334 --> 01:38:45,668
Uh....

1514
01:38:45,836 --> 01:38:49,380
"Stacee Jaxx will tell you
he's a cowboy...

1515
01:38:49,548 --> 01:38:51,799
...but lately he seems more like a...

1516
01:38:53,343 --> 01:38:56,345
...'boy-cow' who's gotten lost
in the herd.

1517
01:38:57,264 --> 01:39:01,684
But the biggest danger is the man
who seems to be calling the shots...

1518
01:39:01,852 --> 01:39:05,188
...his manager Paul Gill,
a man so oily...

1519
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:10,193
...Exxon might want to reconsider
buying stock in him."

1520
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:14,530
Okay, well, you know,
that could also mean that I'm real slick.

1521
01:39:14,698 --> 01:39:16,532
Because I am. There's no such thing
as bad publicity.

1522
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:18,242
 

1523
01:39:20,037 --> 01:39:21,704
 

1524
01:39:21,872 --> 01:39:25,708
Ha-ha-ha. Okay. That was funny.

1525
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:28,586
"Even the legendary Bourbon Room
isn't sacred.

1526
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:32,381
This reporter learned that Stacee Jaxx
and Paul Gill...

1527
01:39:32,549 --> 01:39:37,512
...walked away with virtually
all of the night's proceeds."

1528
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:39,180
STACEE:
Whoa.

1529
01:39:39,348 --> 01:39:41,057
That part.

1530
01:39:42,017 --> 01:39:43,142
Is that true?

1531
01:39:48,982 --> 01:39:51,400
It's not not true.

1532
01:39:51,902 --> 01:39:55,905
It's more more true...

1533
01:39:56,073 --> 01:39:58,491
...than I would perhaps prefer.

1534
01:39:59,201 --> 01:40:01,285
 

1535
01:40:01,453 --> 01:40:04,413
Okay, yes, I'll be clearer about that.

1536
01:40:04,581 --> 01:40:07,625
No more bullshit. No more bullshit.

1537
01:40:09,128 --> 01:40:14,048
I wish that the true part were falser.

1538
01:40:17,052 --> 01:40:19,095
 

1539
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:23,808
You know what, man?
Let's start all over again.

1540
01:40:23,976 --> 01:40:27,103
Let's turn that frown
the right way around.

1541
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:28,688
What do you say, sad clown?

1542
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:33,776
I got something for you. One-of-a-kind.
Ha-ha.

1543
01:40:33,944 --> 01:40:36,737
One hundred and fifty years old.

1544
01:40:36,989 --> 01:40:38,614
Priceless.

1545
01:40:40,284 --> 01:40:42,869
Look, so what if some...

1546
01:40:43,036 --> 01:40:46,289
...hack journalist
took some potshots at you?

1547
01:40:46,456 --> 01:40:49,292
All your life,
you have wanted to be number one.

1548
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:53,129
You still are number one.
Let's toast to that.

1549
01:40:53,338 --> 01:40:56,299
And I'm telling you,
I'm gonna get that reporter fired...

1550
01:40:56,466 --> 01:40:58,968
...so please don't dump that on my head.

1551
01:41:00,762 --> 01:41:01,846
I would never do that.

1552
01:41:04,349 --> 01:41:06,017
 

1553
01:41:10,647 --> 01:41:11,647
 

1554
01:41:13,901 --> 01:41:15,276
 

1555
01:41:18,363 --> 01:41:19,989
STACEE:
Mm.

1556
01:41:20,866 --> 01:41:22,825
150-year-old Scotch.

1557
01:41:23,368 --> 01:41:25,536
 

1558
01:41:27,164 --> 01:41:28,998
It's priceless.

1559
01:41:30,042 --> 01:41:31,834
 

1560
01:41:33,462 --> 01:41:34,921
Mm-hm.

1561
01:41:36,173 --> 01:41:37,506
You're fired, Paul.

1562
01:41:39,176 --> 01:41:40,676
Hey Man.

1563
01:41:40,844 --> 01:41:44,597
 

1564
01:41:44,765 --> 01:41:47,558
PATRICIA  : It just goes to show
that sin doesn't sell anymore.

1565
01:41:47,726 --> 01:41:50,061
And if Dennis Dupree
can't pay by midnight, well....

1566
01:41:50,229 --> 01:41:54,023
MIKE: Then it looks like Los Angeles
will be able to reclaim the real estate.

1567
01:42:08,121 --> 01:42:09,330
Drew?

1568
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:14,210
Sherrie. What are you doing here?

1569
01:42:14,544 --> 01:42:16,545
Sorry. I didn't realize
you owned the place.

1570
01:42:16,713 --> 01:42:17,755
DREW:
Wait, wait, wait.

1571
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:21,676
How are you?

1572
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:26,389
I'm great. Quitting The Bourbon was
the best thing that could've happened.

1573
01:42:26,848 --> 01:42:28,224
Yeah.

1574
01:42:28,642 --> 01:42:29,809
Me too.

1575
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:34,063
What are you wearing?

1576
01:42:35,065 --> 01:42:39,902
Oh, uh.... This is kind of my new look...

1577
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:41,570
...for the band I'm in.

1578
01:42:42,406 --> 01:42:43,739
The Z-Guyeezz.

1579
01:42:43,907 --> 01:42:45,574
Yeah, I've heard of them.
No.

1580
01:42:46,076 --> 01:42:47,243
Not them.

1581
01:42:47,411 --> 01:42:48,744
The Z-Guyeezz.

1582
01:42:49,496 --> 01:42:52,581
Double the E, double the Z,
double the flavor.

1583
01:42:53,166 --> 01:42:55,584
And we're playing The Bourbon tonight.

1584
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:57,795
Huh.

1585
01:42:59,631 --> 01:43:02,300
How about you? You singing?

1586
01:43:05,262 --> 01:43:06,595
No...

1587
01:43:07,764 --> 01:43:09,307
...I'm dancing.

1588
01:43:09,933 --> 01:43:13,019
Aerobics. I teach aerobics.

1589
01:43:18,275 --> 01:43:19,275
 

1590
01:43:20,110 --> 01:43:21,777
Ever see Stacee again?

1591
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:25,614
What do you mean?
After your big fling.

1592
01:43:27,492 --> 01:43:30,202
Wait, you think he and I--?
I don't think.

1593
01:43:31,121 --> 01:43:32,371
I saw you.

1594
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:35,791
What did you see?
The night I played.

1595
01:43:35,959 --> 01:43:39,628
You were walking out of his dressing room,
he was zipping up his pants.

1596
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:49,221
You think I slept with Stacee Jaxx?

1597
01:43:52,559 --> 01:43:54,185
You didn't?

1598
01:43:56,521 --> 01:43:58,647
I was in love with you.

1599
01:44:03,236 --> 01:44:04,487
Drew....

1600
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:07,365
L.A. really isn't working out for me.

1601
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:11,994
It's time to go home.

1602
01:44:13,497 --> 01:44:15,998
Sherrie....
What?

1603
01:44:17,459 --> 01:44:22,963
Sherrie, can we please just start over?

1604
01:44:23,131 --> 01:44:27,093
Pretend nothing--
I'm a stripper at the Venus Club.

1605
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:29,011
I'm in a boy band.

1606
01:44:33,183 --> 01:44:34,683
You win.

1607
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:38,854
No, wait.

1608
01:44:41,858 --> 01:44:43,067
Here.

1609
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:49,907
This is something Wayne,
Ziff and I recorded last week.

1610
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:53,953
That song I was writing.

1611
01:44:55,497 --> 01:44:57,248
The one about us.

1612
01:44:59,876 --> 01:45:01,377
Please...

1613
01:45:02,045 --> 01:45:03,712
...listen to it.

1614
01:45:12,889 --> 01:45:14,348
Sure.

1615
01:45:31,032 --> 01:45:35,619
  We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night

1616
01:45:36,913 --> 01:45:39,915
Although we both lie close together

1617
01:45:40,292 --> 01:45:43,169
We feel miles apart inside

1618
01:45:43,837 --> 01:45:47,423
DREW  : Was it something I said
Or something I did?

1619
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:50,176
Did my words not come out right?

1620
01:45:50,635 --> 01:45:53,596
Though I tried not to hurt you

1621
01:45:54,097 --> 01:45:55,264
Though I tried

1622
01:45:55,432 --> 01:45:58,100
But I guess that's why they say
But I guess that's why they say

1623
01:45:58,268 --> 01:46:02,188
Every rose has its thorn
Every rose has its thorn

1624
01:46:04,065 --> 01:46:10,571
Just like every night has its dawn

1625
01:46:10,947 --> 01:46:17,828
Just like every cowboy
Sings his sad, sad song

1626
01:46:18,788 --> 01:46:23,709
Every rose has its thorn

1627
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:25,085
Yeah, it does

1628
01:46:25,670 --> 01:46:27,463
Though it's been a while now

1629
01:46:27,797 --> 01:46:30,508
I can still feel so much pain

1630
01:46:31,801 --> 01:46:34,803
Like a knife that cuts you
The wound heals

1631
01:46:34,971 --> 01:46:41,060
But the scar
That scar remains

1632
01:46:41,228 --> 01:46:42,728
Yes, it does

1633
01:47:03,166 --> 01:47:05,543
I know I could have saved our love
That night

1634
01:47:05,710 --> 01:47:08,337
If I'd known what to say

1635
01:47:09,756 --> 01:47:11,757
DREW & SHERRIE:
Instead of making love

1636
01:47:11,925 --> 01:47:14,927
We both made our separate ways

1637
01:47:15,136 --> 01:47:17,012
SHERRIE & JUSTICE:
And now I hear you've found

1638
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:18,556
Somebody new

1639
01:47:18,723 --> 01:47:21,767
And that I never meant
That much to you

1640
01:47:21,935 --> 01:47:24,853
To hear that tears me up inside

1641
01:47:25,021 --> 01:47:28,524
And to see you cuts me like a knife

1642
01:47:28,692 --> 01:47:31,277
Oh, every

1643
01:47:31,444 --> 01:47:35,573
Every rose has its thorn

1644
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:37,449
Oh, oh

1645
01:47:37,617 --> 01:47:43,163
SHERRIE, JUSTICE & DREW:
Just like every night has its dawn

1646
01:47:43,373 --> 01:47:49,378
Just like every cowboy
Sings his sad, sad song

1647
01:47:49,546 --> 01:47:50,588
Yeah

1648
01:47:50,755 --> 01:47:55,050
Every rose has its thorn

1649
01:47:55,218 --> 01:47:56,719
Oh, yeah

1650
01:47:56,886 --> 01:48:06,687
Every rose has its thorn

1651
01:48:14,738 --> 01:48:15,946
 

1652
01:48:16,114 --> 01:48:17,573
DRIVER:
Asshole!

1653
01:48:19,659 --> 01:48:21,869
  Swingin' so hard,
Forgot to lock the door

1654
01:48:22,037 --> 01:48:24,079
In walks her daddy,
Standin' six foot four

1655
01:48:24,247 --> 01:48:26,498
He said,"You ain't gonna swing
With my daughter no more"

1656
01:48:26,666 --> 01:48:27,833
STACEE:
Justice.

1657
01:48:28,001 --> 01:48:31,128
JUSTICE:
Stacee Jaxx. It's been too long.

1658
01:48:31,296 --> 01:48:35,424
-a sweet surprise
Tastes so good, make a grown man cry

1659
01:48:35,759 --> 01:48:37,635
So you see anything you like?

1660
01:48:38,219 --> 01:48:40,262
She's my cherry pie

1661
01:48:40,555 --> 01:48:43,641
Put a smile on your face 10 miles wide

1662
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:48,520
Looks so good, bring a tear to your eye
Sweet cherry pie

1663
01:48:48,855 --> 01:48:51,690
Sweet cherry pie

1664
01:48:59,282 --> 01:49:01,825
How much to make my pain go away?

1665
01:49:03,119 --> 01:49:04,536
I just dance.

1666
01:49:04,704 --> 01:49:06,538
STACEE:
I like to dance.

1667
01:49:09,751 --> 01:49:11,669
Ten thousand.

1668
01:49:21,096 --> 01:49:22,680
Why not?

1669
01:49:48,623 --> 01:49:51,667
 
It's early morning, the sun comes out

1670
01:49:51,835 --> 01:49:55,754
Last night was shaking and pretty loud

1671
01:49:55,922 --> 01:49:59,717
My cat is purring and scratches my skin

1672
01:49:59,884 --> 01:50:03,554
So what is wrong with another sin?

1673
01:50:03,805 --> 01:50:07,349
 
The bitch is hungry, she needs to tell

1674
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:10,978
So give her inches and feed her well

1675
01:50:11,688 --> 01:50:15,065
More days to come, new places to go

1676
01:50:15,233 --> 01:50:20,946
I've got to leave, it's time for the show

1677
01:50:22,866 --> 01:50:37,171
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

1678
01:50:40,008 --> 01:50:43,761
My body is burning,
It starts to shout

1679
01:50:44,012 --> 01:50:47,514
Desire is coming, it breaks out loud

1680
01:50:47,974 --> 01:50:51,351
Lust is in cages still storm breaks loose

1681
01:50:51,644 --> 01:50:55,397
I just have to make it with someone I choose

1682
01:50:55,648 --> 01:50:59,151
The night is calling, I have to go
The night is calling, I have to go

1683
01:50:59,486 --> 01:51:01,153
SHERRIE:
The wolf is hungry

1684
01:51:01,321 --> 01:51:02,988
He runs the show
He runs the show

1685
01:51:03,156 --> 01:51:07,034
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win

1686
01:51:07,243 --> 01:51:12,498
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting

1687
01:51:15,126 --> 01:51:20,672
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

1688
01:51:21,090 --> 01:51:22,549
Are you ready, baby?

1689
01:51:22,717 --> 01:51:30,349
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

1690
01:51:31,184 --> 01:51:34,353
Rock you like a hurricane

1691
01:51:40,777 --> 01:51:46,198
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

1692
01:51:46,533 --> 01:51:48,242
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

1693
01:51:48,409 --> 01:51:55,040
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane
Here I am, rock you like a hurricane

1694
01:51:57,877 --> 01:51:59,795
Here I am!
Here I am!

1695
01:52:25,405 --> 01:52:28,031
We don't really want this.

1696
01:52:48,761 --> 01:52:51,096
Sherrie? What's wrong, honey?

1697
01:52:51,264 --> 01:52:53,473
I'm fine, I'm just a little...

1698
01:52:54,684 --> 01:52:55,934
...ruined.

1699
01:52:58,104 --> 01:52:59,855
I never should've come to L.A.

1700
01:53:00,023 --> 01:53:03,775
You ain't ruined, baby.
But you will be if you stay here.

1701
01:53:04,611 --> 01:53:07,779
It's not fame and fortune
you came looking for, Sherrie.

1702
01:53:08,156 --> 01:53:09,865
It's love.

1703
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:13,327
And love left this place a long time ago.

1704
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:15,621
WOMAN:
Sherrie?

1705
01:53:15,788 --> 01:53:18,040
Someone dropped this off for you.

1706
01:53:22,003 --> 01:53:24,963
SHERRIE:"Sometimes things that are lost
can be found again.

1707
01:53:25,131 --> 01:53:27,633
Don't stop believing. Love, Drew."

1708
01:53:38,102 --> 01:53:40,312
 

1709
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:43,398
Rolling Stone. Also, we're closed.

1710
01:53:43,566 --> 01:53:46,318
STACEE:
Put Cinderella on the phone.

1711
01:53:46,486 --> 01:53:49,655
Are you talking about the fake person
with the stepmother?

1712
01:53:49,822 --> 01:53:52,532
She stuck her tongue in my ear.

1713
01:53:53,576 --> 01:53:55,494
She blew my world up.

1714
01:53:55,662 --> 01:53:57,496
Are you messing with me right now?

1715
01:53:57,664 --> 01:54:01,083
Is it someone that is trying to really
freak me out? Because it's working.

1716
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:02,459
This goddess...

1717
01:54:02,627 --> 01:54:04,878
...she put a mirror up to Stacee Jaxx.

1718
01:54:05,046 --> 01:54:06,672
You're talking about Constance...

1719
01:54:06,839 --> 01:54:09,508
...not Cinderella, which--
I guess they sound similar.

1720
01:54:09,676 --> 01:54:10,842
Constance Sack.

1721
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:12,344
Constance?

1722
01:54:13,513 --> 01:54:14,680
Put her on.

1723
01:54:14,847 --> 01:54:16,765
She's not here. She's at The Bourbon...

1724
01:54:16,975 --> 01:54:20,352
...in Los Angeles, and she's covering
Stacee Jaxx's first solo gig.

1725
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:22,479
So you can go there and weird her out.

1726
01:54:23,856 --> 01:54:25,357
I have a gig?

1727
01:54:26,192 --> 01:54:28,527
Are you Stacee Jaxx?

1728
01:54:29,487 --> 01:54:30,570
Hello?

1729
01:54:31,698 --> 01:54:35,909
Great. That's not gonna make me feel
like I'm gonna get killed tonight.

1730
01:54:36,828 --> 01:54:40,622
LONNY: People!
We must obey petty bureaucracy.

1731
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:43,417
It's what separates us from the beasts.

1732
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:46,420
Just remember the moves, right?
Remember the attitude.

1733
01:54:46,587 --> 01:54:49,089
And make sure that those
head mikes are turned off.

1734
01:54:49,257 --> 01:54:51,633
God forbid anyone hears
your actual voices.

1735
01:54:51,801 --> 01:54:53,510
Oh! Nice of you to show.

1736
01:54:53,886 --> 01:54:55,762
I don't understand why we can't sing.

1737
01:54:55,930 --> 01:54:58,724
It's better this way.
Less chance to screw up, right?

1738
01:54:58,891 --> 01:55:00,851
Wait. We're not singing?

1739
01:55:01,019 --> 01:55:03,020
All we gotta do is mouth the words.

1740
01:55:03,896 --> 01:55:05,897
So we're lip-synching?
Just relax.

1741
01:55:06,065 --> 01:55:09,026
It's done all the time.
Pretty soon everyone will do it.

1742
01:55:09,193 --> 01:55:10,527
Does Dennis know?

1743
01:55:10,695 --> 01:55:14,072
Don't worry your pretty little head about
Dennis. I'm saving his ass tonight.

1744
01:55:14,532 --> 01:55:16,116
All right, fellas? Come on. Let's go.

1745
01:55:16,284 --> 01:55:17,743
Everybody in.

1746
01:55:18,411 --> 01:55:20,704
 

1747
01:55:23,458 --> 01:55:26,376
As you can see,
this club is totally out of control.

1748
01:55:26,544 --> 01:55:28,670
But, Mitch, this ends tonight.

1749
01:55:29,005 --> 01:55:32,716
It's time we wiped the filth off the streets
of this great city.

1750
01:55:32,884 --> 01:55:35,969
The people of Los Angeles
are not gonna take it anymore.

1751
01:55:36,137 --> 01:55:40,640
Powerful words from Patricia Whitmore.
LONNY: You! Mrs. Mayor!

1752
01:55:40,808 --> 01:55:42,059
Why are you so uptight?

1753
01:55:42,226 --> 01:55:46,563
You lot need to feel the wind of change.
Blow the cobwebs out of your gussets.

1754
01:55:47,023 --> 01:55:50,108
We built this city on rock 'n' roll.

1755
01:55:50,276 --> 01:55:51,818
Right?
Yeah, we did!

1756
01:55:51,986 --> 01:55:53,487
 
We built this city

1757
01:55:53,988 --> 01:55:56,364
My grandfather's father
built this city!

1758
01:55:56,532 --> 01:55:58,450
We built this city on rock 'n' roll

1759
01:55:58,618 --> 01:56:00,327
FANS  :
Built this city

1760
01:56:00,495 --> 01:56:02,120
How dare you!

1761
01:56:02,288 --> 01:56:06,500
We built this city on rock 'n' roll

1762
01:56:07,001 --> 01:56:09,169
Who counts the money

1763
01:56:10,213 --> 01:56:12,005
Underneath the bar?

1764
01:56:14,050 --> 01:56:16,510
Who rides the wrecking ball

1765
01:56:16,886 --> 01:56:19,513
Into our guitars?

1766
01:56:20,264 --> 01:56:22,682
Don't tell us you need us

1767
01:56:24,018 --> 01:56:26,937
'Cause we're the ship of fools

1768
01:56:27,396 --> 01:56:30,232
Lookin' for America

1769
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:32,818
Crawlin' through your schools

1770
01:56:33,945 --> 01:56:36,029
PROTESTERS:
We're not gonna take it

1771
01:56:36,197 --> 01:56:37,239
We built this city

1772
01:56:37,406 --> 01:56:39,366
No, we ain't gonna take it

1773
01:56:39,534 --> 01:56:40,742
We built this city

1774
01:56:40,910 --> 01:56:43,954
We're not gonna take it anymore

1775
01:56:44,122 --> 01:56:47,666
We built this city on rock 'n' roll

1776
01:56:47,834 --> 01:56:51,086
We're not gonna take it
We built this city

1777
01:56:51,254 --> 01:56:54,256
No, we ain't gonna take it
We built this city

1778
01:56:54,423 --> 01:56:57,384
We're not gonna take it anymore

1779
01:56:57,552 --> 01:57:09,688
We built this city on rock 'n' roll

1780
01:57:09,897 --> 01:57:11,898
 

1781
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:14,943
MITCH:
Stacee Jaxx has just arrived...

1782
01:57:15,111 --> 01:57:16,403
...for his first solo show!

1783
01:57:16,571 --> 01:57:20,574
It seems history is no doubt about to be
made again at The Bourbon Room tonight!

1784
01:57:20,741 --> 01:57:21,867
PATRICIA:
Hey!

1785
01:57:22,577 --> 01:57:23,743
No! No, no!

1786
01:57:24,245 --> 01:57:26,454
Where is the police
when you need them?

1787
01:57:26,622 --> 01:57:30,083
Hey, you! Hey, policeman!
You can't let him in there!

1788
01:57:30,418 --> 01:57:31,543
LONNY:
Here, hold this.

1789
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:33,753
Stacee, excited about the show?

1790
01:57:35,089 --> 01:57:36,298
Thank you.

1791
01:57:36,799 --> 01:57:38,967
PATRICIA:
Are you listening to me?

1792
01:57:39,302 --> 01:57:40,760
 

1793
01:57:41,012 --> 01:57:42,596
PATRICIA:
What are you doing?

1794
01:57:43,598 --> 01:57:45,640
He can't go in there!

1795
01:57:46,475 --> 01:57:48,268
Oh, God!

1796
01:57:53,774 --> 01:57:56,943
PATRICIA:
You stay away from me.

1797
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:04,034
 

1798
01:58:04,202 --> 01:58:05,493
 

1799
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:09,122
Patty.

1800
01:58:12,418 --> 01:58:14,628
Your tits have held up well.

1801
01:58:14,795 --> 01:58:16,963
 

1802
01:58:20,509 --> 01:58:22,469
Oh, my God!

1803
01:58:22,637 --> 01:58:24,638
 

1804
01:58:25,973 --> 01:58:27,974
 

1805
01:58:28,142 --> 01:58:30,143
 

1806
01:58:33,648 --> 01:58:38,318
Mitch, this is breaking news.
I have in my hand an album.

1807
01:58:38,486 --> 01:58:42,030
It's Arsenal 1977 Live at The Bourbon.
Great album, incidentally.

1808
01:58:42,198 --> 01:58:45,325
If I could just draw your attention
to the inside sleeve.

1809
01:58:45,493 --> 01:58:47,661
This photograph here of a nymph...

1810
01:58:47,828 --> 01:58:52,040
...apparently about to gargle
Stacee Jaxx's body porridge...

1811
01:58:52,208 --> 01:58:56,419
...is none other than Patricia Whitmore,
the mayor's wife!

1812
01:58:56,587 --> 01:58:59,172
SECRETARY: Ooh!
LONNY: This is our Watergate!

1813
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:00,757
Rock lives on!

1814
01:59:00,925 --> 01:59:02,259
MITCH:
You saw it here live.

1815
01:59:02,426 --> 01:59:06,554
The mayor's wife appears to be an
ex-groupie of none other than Stacee Jaxx!

1816
01:59:06,722 --> 01:59:08,556
Sweet baby Jesus.

1817
01:59:08,724 --> 01:59:09,975
Stop! You cut that!

1818
01:59:10,142 --> 01:59:12,143
 

1819
01:59:15,606 --> 01:59:17,649
 

1820
01:59:17,817 --> 01:59:19,526
MAN:
Hey, look. It's Stacee Jaxx.

1821
01:59:31,455 --> 01:59:33,999
I'm telling you, it's Stacee Jaxx.

1822
01:59:34,250 --> 01:59:35,792
I'm telling you.

1823
01:59:36,877 --> 01:59:38,545
WOMAN 1: Sure?
Oh, my God.

1824
01:59:38,713 --> 01:59:40,213
WOMAN 2:
Oh, my God!

1825
01:59:40,381 --> 01:59:42,424
WOMAN 3:
Oh, my God! Stacee!

1826
01:59:51,517 --> 01:59:53,059
Yeah.

1827
01:59:54,437 --> 01:59:55,895
 

1828
01:59:59,108 --> 02:00:00,317
 

1829
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:21,963
I'm sorry about the article.

1830
02:00:23,799 --> 02:00:25,759
Open your mouth.

1831
02:00:31,057 --> 02:00:33,058
 

1832
02:00:36,645 --> 02:00:39,105
Uh, uh, uh....

1833
02:00:41,692 --> 02:00:43,693
 

1834
02:00:52,036 --> 02:00:54,037
 

1835
02:00:56,791 --> 02:00:58,166
Ladies and gentlemen...

1836
02:00:58,334 --> 02:01:01,544
...you foul and pestilent congregation
of vapors...

1837
02:01:01,712 --> 02:01:04,005
...we're gonna have a fantastic
evening tonight!

1838
02:01:04,173 --> 02:01:07,342
Later, performing on this stage,
we'll see Stacee Jaxx!

1839
02:01:08,094 --> 02:01:09,552
But before that...

1840
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:12,972
...we will have the less important...

1841
02:01:13,140 --> 02:01:14,808
...but somehow worthwhile...

1842
02:01:14,975 --> 02:01:19,187
...making their debut here on
The Bourbon stage, the....

1843
02:01:20,147 --> 02:01:23,191
"Z-Guyeezz."

1844
02:01:24,318 --> 02:01:25,735
Give it a whirl, I suppose.

1845
02:01:25,986 --> 02:01:27,529
MAN 1:
Rock 'n' roll!

1846
02:01:27,738 --> 02:01:29,614
DREW:
So may I introduce to you...

1847
02:01:29,824 --> 02:01:32,158
...the guys you've known
for all these days:

1848
02:01:32,326 --> 02:01:33,368
The Z-Guyeezz.

1849
02:01:33,536 --> 02:01:35,286
Donny-Z.
Kevy-Z.

1850
02:01:35,454 --> 02:01:36,496
Me, Joey-Z.

1851
02:01:36,664 --> 02:01:37,831
And Joshy-Z.

1852
02:01:37,998 --> 02:01:40,166
  You
Me

1853
02:01:40,334 --> 02:01:43,044
One day we can have a baby

1854
02:01:43,212 --> 02:01:44,337
Is that Drew?

1855
02:01:44,505 --> 02:01:46,172
I'm afraid it is, yes.

1856
02:01:46,507 --> 02:01:48,383
Oh, my God, I just threw up.

1857
02:01:48,551 --> 02:01:50,176
Where?

1858
02:01:50,344 --> 02:01:51,719
In my pants.

1859
02:01:53,055 --> 02:01:54,931
Out of my ass.

1860
02:01:55,558 --> 02:01:57,517
MAN 2:
Hey, they're lip-synching!

1861
02:01:58,686 --> 02:02:02,230
Z-GUYEEZZ:
Baby girl, I wanna still be

1862
02:02:02,398 --> 02:02:05,775
Who is this?
The Z-Guyeezz.

1863
02:02:06,277 --> 02:02:07,944
Great, right?

1864
02:02:08,112 --> 02:02:09,988
Where is Stacee?

1865
02:02:10,156 --> 02:02:11,531
Really sick.

1866
02:02:11,699 --> 02:02:14,409
 

1867
02:02:14,577 --> 02:02:16,786
Hush
Hush

1868
02:02:16,954 --> 02:02:21,124
Baby, we've been talking too much

1869
02:02:21,542 --> 02:02:26,087
I just wanna stare at your....
Shh

1870
02:02:26,338 --> 02:02:28,381
 
Put my hands around it

1871
02:02:28,549 --> 02:02:30,216
Squeeze, touch

1872
02:02:31,385 --> 02:02:32,594
 
Thank you.

1873
02:02:33,304 --> 02:02:34,888
Don't rush

1874
02:02:36,223 --> 02:02:38,892
Hey! Ho, ho, ho!
What the hell are you doing?

1875
02:02:48,777 --> 02:02:51,321
Sherrie, I'm so sorry.

1876
02:02:51,489 --> 02:02:53,364
Drew, stop! Shh.
I should have trusted you.

1877
02:02:53,532 --> 02:02:55,116
It's okay. It's okay.

1878
02:02:57,661 --> 02:02:59,245
You can't go home.

1879
02:03:10,758 --> 02:03:12,842
Your new band sucks.

1880
02:03:13,511 --> 02:03:15,970
And, yeah, this? This has gotta go.
Heh. Whoo.

1881
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:21,100
You got L-O-V
Baby, I could be the E

1882
02:03:21,268 --> 02:03:25,647
Hey, Joshy-Z, if all these people
want refunds, my club is closed.

1883
02:03:27,149 --> 02:03:28,858
Oh, oh
Yeah

1884
02:03:29,026 --> 02:03:30,151
Wait.

1885
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:33,154
Just wait right here.

1886
02:03:33,697 --> 02:03:34,948
Hi.

1887
02:03:36,492 --> 02:03:38,743
MAN 3:
I want my money back!

1888
02:03:38,953 --> 02:03:40,078
Oh, Hey Man.

1889
02:03:42,456 --> 02:03:45,166
Oh, my God.

1890
02:03:48,963 --> 02:03:50,129
"I owe you this.

1891
02:03:50,464 --> 02:03:53,216
Your rock brother, Stacee."

1892
02:03:53,717 --> 02:03:56,219
God! That Stacee Jaxx.

1893
02:03:56,804 --> 02:03:58,638
He gives until it hurts.

1894
02:03:58,973 --> 02:04:01,599
 

1895
02:04:09,733 --> 02:04:11,067
 

1896
02:04:11,860 --> 02:04:13,236
Whoa.

1897
02:04:13,779 --> 02:04:15,238
MAN 4:
That's right, get him off!

1898
02:04:15,698 --> 02:04:17,699
 

1899
02:04:20,202 --> 02:04:21,494
Hey!

1900
02:04:22,580 --> 02:04:24,747
You little shit.

1901
02:04:24,915 --> 02:04:27,083
You just destroyed your one shot.

1902
02:04:27,251 --> 02:04:30,211
I didn't destroy anything, Paul.
I took a stand.

1903
02:04:30,379 --> 02:04:31,588
Really? For what?

1904
02:04:31,755 --> 02:04:33,214
Rock 'n' roll, baby.

1905
02:04:33,382 --> 02:04:35,174
 

1906
02:04:35,342 --> 02:04:37,760
Oh, rock is over, pal.

1907
02:04:38,053 --> 02:04:40,597
Rock is dead!

1908
02:04:42,308 --> 02:04:46,019
Ha-ha-ha. That's right, Hey Man,
rock will never die.

1909
02:04:46,979 --> 02:04:48,104
 

1910
02:04:48,355 --> 02:04:49,355
KEVY-Z:
Aah!

1911
02:04:50,357 --> 02:04:51,357
 

1912
02:04:51,775 --> 02:04:53,943
SHERRIE:
All right! Well, now that that's over...

1913
02:04:54,111 --> 02:04:55,528
...are you guys ready to rock?

1914
02:04:55,696 --> 02:04:57,280
 

1915
02:04:59,325 --> 02:05:03,077
This is a very special song,
written by a very special person.

1916
02:05:06,874 --> 02:05:09,250
 
Just a small-town girl

1917
02:05:10,127 --> 02:05:13,046
Livin' in a lonely world

1918
02:05:14,089 --> 02:05:19,844
She took the midnight train
Goin' anywhere

1919
02:05:22,097 --> 02:05:24,474
Just a city boy

1920
02:05:25,559 --> 02:05:28,645
Born and raised in South Detroit

1921
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:35,485
He took the midnight train
Goin' anywhere

1922
02:05:38,530 --> 02:05:39,656
 

1923
02:05:47,706 --> 02:05:49,082
 

1924
02:05:51,794 --> 02:05:54,796
A singer in a smoky room

1925
02:05:55,631 --> 02:05:58,633
The smell of wine
And cheap perfume

1926
02:05:59,301 --> 02:06:01,803
For a smile they can share the night

1927
02:06:01,970 --> 02:06:06,182
It goes on and on and on and on

1928
02:06:06,350 --> 02:06:10,228
Strangers waitin'
Strangers waitin'

1929
02:06:10,938 --> 02:06:13,356
Up and down the boulevard
Up and down the boulevard

1930
02:06:13,524 --> 02:06:19,821
Their shadows searching in the night
Their shadows searching in the night

1931
02:06:21,365 --> 02:06:25,034
Streetlights, people
Streetlights, people

1932
02:06:26,412 --> 02:06:29,122
Livin' just to find emotion
Livin' just to find emotion

1933
02:06:29,289 --> 02:06:36,963
Hidin' somewhere in the night
Hidin' somewhere in the night

1934
02:06:38,632 --> 02:06:41,426
 

1935
02:06:45,013 --> 02:06:47,849
 
Workin' hard to get my fill

1936
02:06:49,268 --> 02:06:52,145
Everybody wants a thrill

1937
02:06:52,646 --> 02:06:55,314
Payin' anything to roll the dice

1938
02:06:55,482 --> 02:06:58,901
Just one more time

1939
02:07:00,195 --> 02:07:01,612
Some will win

1940
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:03,865
Some will lose

1941
02:07:04,366 --> 02:07:07,493
Some were born to sing the blues
Some were born to sing the blues

1942
02:07:07,870 --> 02:07:10,204
Oh, the movie never ends

1943
02:07:10,372 --> 02:07:15,460
It goes on and on and on and on

1944
02:07:15,669 --> 02:07:19,380
Hey, put your hands together, Los Angeles,
for the man who wrote this song...

1945
02:07:19,548 --> 02:07:21,174
...and my very special friends...

1946
02:07:21,341 --> 02:07:22,800
...Von Colt!

1947
02:07:23,177 --> 02:07:26,053
Strangers waitin'
Strangers waitin'

1948
02:07:27,097 --> 02:07:29,599
Up and down the boulevard
Up and down the boulevard

1949
02:07:29,767 --> 02:07:36,022
Their shadows searching in the night
Their shadows searching in the night

1950
02:07:37,691 --> 02:07:41,611
Streetlights, people
Streetlights, people

1951
02:07:42,613 --> 02:07:45,364
Livin' just to find emotion
Livin' just to find emotion

1952
02:07:45,532 --> 02:07:52,747
Hidin' somewhere in the night
Hidin' somewhere in the night

1953
02:08:08,472 --> 02:08:11,390
Don't stop believin'

1954
02:08:11,558 --> 02:08:15,645
Yeah, hold on to that feelin'

1955
02:08:15,813 --> 02:08:23,194
Streetlights, people

02:08:23,487 --> 02:08:26,572
Don't stop believin'

Don't stop believin'

1960
02:08:42,548 --> 02:08:44,048
Oh, hold on

Hold on to that feelin'

1962

Streetlights, people

1963
02:08:53,934 --> 02:09:00,940
Don't stop
