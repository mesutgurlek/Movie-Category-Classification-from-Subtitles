1
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,213
Careful, Tucker.

2
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:53,945
The floor is hot lava. You can't touch
the ground, or you'll burn up.

3
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,818
We gotta get to Craig's room
to get the treasure before we burn up.

4
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:00,051
- Whas the treasure?
- Craig just got a MichaelJordan rookie card.

5
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,958
It cost him, like, a hundred bucks.

6
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,293
Whoa.

7
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,890
Did you know that in
MichaelJordan's first year with the Bulls...

8
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,903
MichaelJordan had 138 rebounds?

9
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,974
Yeah. But you know who
the Bulls rebound leader is, though?

10
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,305
- Yeah. Scottie Pippen.
- Yeah.

11
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,675
- Where's the card?
- Is in the closet in a shoe box.

12
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:27,080
He's got the MichaelJordan rookie card
and a Hank Aaron card.

13
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:30,088
Is not in mint condition,
but is a good card.

14
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,093
- Oh, my God.
- What?

15
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,163
- Your brother's got a Playboy.
- No, he doesn't.

16
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,699
- Whas a Playboy?
- A magazine with naked ladies.

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,961
What? He doesn't have that.

18
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:46,368
Look. Dude, I think your brother
can go to jail for this.

19
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:49,601
Shut up. Don't open it.

20
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,446
Is that what girls look like?

21
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,448
They look so weird.

22
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,450
How do they pee?

23
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,520
It must come out of those.

24
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,384
Gross.

25
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,390
Oh, my God.

26
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,392
Look at that one.

27
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,986
- Tucker, you just stepped
on hot lava. You're on fire.
- Whatever.

28
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,588
#Give me some
of your sweetness, honey #

29
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,427
#Give me some
of that sweet thing now #

30
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,635
Oh, my God.

31
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,233
Look at the ass on that thing.

32
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,542
- Hello.
- What?

33
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:32,015
You could bounce a quarter off
that sweet turd-cutter.

34
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:35,554
Tucker, stop it.
Thas Eleanore, our friend.

35
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,555
Her mom's my piano teacher.

36
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:42,094
Oh, man. I want her to
French-kiss my dick so bad.

37
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:45,221
Oh, my God.

38
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,265
#Give me some of that
sweetness, honey ##

39
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,426
Look at this.

40
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,937
Jenny's tits are the exact
same size as Miss November's.

41
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,941
- I don't care.
- This means that this is
whatJenny looks like naked.

42
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,603
- Thas amazing.
- That is amazing.

43
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,543
- Hi, Stacy.
- Drop dead.

44
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,843
- Hi, Sheila.
- Eat me, Tucker.

45
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,919
- Set the time and place.
- The two of you can eat shit and die.

46
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,079
Sheila!

47
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,089
Thank you. You know
she's friends with Cindi.

48
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,887
Now she's gonna tell her,
I'm gonna hear all about this. Good job.

49
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:17,724
Relax. Your girlfrienïs gonna know
it wasn't you. She knows your deal.

50
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,730
Hey, Candace. Looking good.

51
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,766
Heard you went on the pill.

52
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:29,102
What the fuck did you just say to me?

53
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,268
Nothing. I-I didn't say anything.

54
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,545
Candace, uh, sorry.
I won't go out with you.

55
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,085
I just- I don't dig handicapped chicks.

56
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,020
I have epilepsy, you limp-dicked shit.

57
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,989
I'm not handicapped. Is a condition.

58
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:51,359
Tucker, if you so much as
make eye contact with me again...

59
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,364
my brother will kill you.

60
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,900
- He's a firefighter, and they're crazy.
- Okay, okay.

61
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,970
Deal. Deal. Deal.

62
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,405
Geez. What a bitch.

63
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,605
- What was that?
- Nothing. I didn't say anything.

64
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:20,424
Man, why do you even do these sermons?
They don't even pay you.

65
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:25,327
Tucker, I have told you.
They're not sermons, they're seminars.

66
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:29,595
I do them because I believe in them, and
I think kids need to hear this message.

67
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:32,296
I wish my brother
had had a seminar like this.

68
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:42,909
Shh.

69
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:47,817
And now I'd like to bring up
Eugene Bell and Cindi Whitehall...

70
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,187
a young couple who will be graduating
from our high school this year.

71
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:58,162
Les give a nice, warm
Jefferson County Middle School welcome...

72
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,960
to Eugene and Cindi.

73
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,162
Come on!

74
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,002
Hey, gang.

75
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:14,205
We're here today to talk to you about one of
the most important decisions that you can make.

76
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,579
Now, I know at your age you guys
probably think all the older guys and gals...

77
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,584
are out there having sex.

78
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,586
But Cindi and I...

79
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,316
have been in a relationship
for two and a half years now...

80
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,359
and we've decided to
save ourselves for marriage.

81
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,087
Thas right, Eugene.

82
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,720
We have a happy, healthy romance...

83
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,732
and we don't need intercourse
to prove that.

84
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,735
I'd like to tell you guys
a story right now if I can.

85
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,273
This is a true story that happened to
my older brother, Craig.

86
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:45,435
Craig was a nice, normal kid,
just like me or you.

87
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:50,608
Then one night, he and his
girlfriend of two years...

88
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,618
decided to go-
all the way.

89
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,188
It was Craig's first time having sex...

90
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,190
and he thought, hey, whas
the worst thing that could happen?

91
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,658
He thought they were sharing
something very special.

92
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,059
But what she was sharing
with him was syphilis.

93
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,290
He got syphilis.

94
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,392
Then she got pregnant, and
because she smoked cigarettes...

95
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,869
the baby came out a crackhead.

96
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,874
The once-happy couple soon broke up.

97
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,877
Craig had to drop out of high school
and work two jobs so he could keep up with...

98
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,879
the child support payments
and the medical bills.

99
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,779
But it didn't stop there.

100
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,877
One afternoon while my mother was babysitting
for Craig, the baby set the house on fire.

101
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,548
Because he was a crackhead.

102
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:34,888
My mother and little nephew
died in that blaze...

103
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,895
and the grief from that,
along with the advanced stages of syphilis...

104
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,898
which put an enormous amount
of pressure on Craig's frontal lobe...

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,729
drove him insane.

106
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,668
Today Eugene's brother
sits in a padded cell...

107
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,332
doing nothing but eating his own feces-

108
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,500
And regretting the one time...

109
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,805
that he had sex.

110
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,903
Whoa!

111
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,244
Here, buddy.

112
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,318
Lights, please.

113
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,853
This is a venereal disease.

114
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,045
- Hey.
- Hey. I'm in the tree.

115
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,483
- Hey.
- Hi.

116
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,492
- Are your parents asleep?
- Yeah, they just went to bed.

117
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,791
Hey, so Tucker told me about this awesome
party this weekend after the dance.

118
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,797
I think we should totally go.

119
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,528
You want to go to a party
with Tucker after prom?

120
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,571
Yeah. I mean, thas-
thas what people do, right?

121
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:57,404
Eugene, did you think about
what we talked about?

122
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,002
Uh, yeah, you know, I did think about it.

123
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:05,015
But, like, I think I need a little bit more time
just to work everything out in my head...

124
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,517
like a month or just a couple of weeks...

125
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,747
'cause there's, like, a lot of factors.

126
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:13,519
Eugene, I love you. We've been going out
for two and a half years.

127
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:17,027
- I think we're ready.
- Thas what Sandra said to Craig.

128
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,690
Oh, will you stop talking about
your crazy brother? That was a fluke.

129
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,600
My younger sister has sex all the time,
and neither of her babies are crackheads.

130
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,605
Cindi, I can't believe
what I'm hearing right now.

131
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:31,404
What about the seminar? What about
everything we said to those kids this afternoon?

132
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,275
I don't think that 15-year-old kids
should be having sex.

133
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,577
You have to wait until you find
that special someone.

134
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,618
But, Eugene, you are my special someone.

135
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,953
And if I'm not yours, then I think that we have
a whole other set of problems to worry about.

136
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,894
I'm gonna go to bed.

137
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,226
I'll call you tomorrow.

138
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,761
Cindi, wait.

139
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,630
I'll have sex with you on prom night.

140
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,538
You promise?

141
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,473
I promise I'll have sex
with you on prom night.

142
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,480
I love you, Eugene.

143
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,743
I love you, Cindi.

144
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:24,756
- Hello?
- Dude!

145
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:26,990
Five hours till you're chode deep.

146
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:28,793
Yes, I know that. Thank you.

147
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,232
Are you psyched? Are you psyched?

148
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:33,236
Yes, I'm very psyched.

149
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:35,829
- Did you shave your cock yet?
- What?

150
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:38,842
You gotta shave your cock.
It makes it look bigger.

151
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:41,344
Really? Wh- I'm not shaving my cock.

152
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:45,075
You have to. You gonna have shaved balls
and a hairy cock? Thas gonna look weird.

153
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:46,844
I'm not shaving my balls either.

154
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:49,750
- Oh, my God.
- Tucker, I've got this, okay?

155
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:52,652
Eugene, no, you don't got this.

156
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:56,693
Look, man, I've already slept with 12 women.
Thas punishable by stoning in some countries.

157
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:59,320
- Thas great, Tucker.
- That is great.

158
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:02,923
And I've only been having sex
for two years. Thas six women a year.

159
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:05,093
Do you know what that means?

160
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:08,195
That means in 10 years,
I'll have banged, like, 600 chicks.

161
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:10,831
Did you get the limo? I'm supposed
to pick Cindi up in half an hour.

162
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:14,378
Horsedick. MPEG's got it.
He's picking you up.

163
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:18,279
- Who is Horsedick. MPEG?
- Oh, thas Phil, man. Thas his M.C. Name.

164
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:21,284
- Phil's M.C. Name is Horsedick?
- Dot-MPEG.

165
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:23,684
Dot-MPEG. That is so ridiculous.

166
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:26,450
Dude, you are so white.
And whas with this attitude?

167
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:29,459
This is gonna be the best
night of your life.

168
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:33,554
Look, I'm not even sure I'm ready to be
doing this. Do you have any helpful advice?

169
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:37,431
Do you have any tips on how I can make this
a wonderful, romantic night for Cindi...

170
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:40,163
and everything she wants it to be?

171
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:42,171
Shave your cock.

172
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:44,400
Yeah.

173
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:47,603
Hold on. I think the limo's here.

174
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:51,170
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

175
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:55,082
# I'm gon'fuck
a white bitch, I'm gon'fuck a white bitch #

176
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:58,747
Man, I ain't seen this motherfucker in,
like, four-11 years or some shit.

177
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:02,759
I didn't know they let people that
dropped out of high school go to prom.

178
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:08,423
You're stupid! You're stupid!

179
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:10,694
No, Crystal's still in high school.

180
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:14,363
I also didn't know
they let freshmen go to prom.

181
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:17,532
Well, they're gonna let us in there
when Horsedick. MPEG rolls up.

182
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:20,543
I'm about to sign me a record deal.

183
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:23,409
Horsedick's got a song on the Internet!

184
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:26,848
The Internet. Wow.

185
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:29,784
You know how many motherfuckers
use the Internet?

186
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:32,220
I know a lot do.

187
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:36,020
Half of them! I'm talkin' 'bout thousands
and thousands of motherfuckers, man.

188
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:40,723
And now my shit is up there.
Whoo. We celebratin;

189
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:42,595
Um, hey, Horsedick?

190
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,602
- Dot-MPEG!
- Dot-MPEG.

191
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,604
Sorry.

192
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:51,107
Would you mind turning the music down just
a bit? We're almost to my girlfrienïs house.

193
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,769
You can't turn Horsedick. MPEG down.

194
00:11:53,878 --> 00:11:56,608
This is my shit. I made this.

195
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:59,115
- I made this.
- # I'm gon'fuck a white bitch #

196
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:01,651
- # I'm gon'fuck a white bitch #
- # I made this shit #

197
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:05,945
This is my shit!

198
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:15,394
# I'm gon' fuck a white bitch
I'm gon' fuck a white bitch #

199
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:26,069
Hi, Cindi. Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Whitehall.

200
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:28,077
Hi.

201
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:30,511
Thas some ride
you've got there, Eugene.

202
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:34,073
Thank you.

203
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:37,279
- So, there won't be any drinking
going on tonight, will there?
- Dad.

204
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:39,219
No, sir. Not at all.

205
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:43,055
Let me get a picture of the two of you.

206
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:49,300
Oh, Horsedick, you are nasty!

207
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:54,537
Hey, Daddy.

208
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,904
Come on, get in the car, baby.

209
00:12:59,277 --> 00:13:01,609
Come here, motherfucker.

210
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:07,343
- Yeah!
- Spank it!

211
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:21,554
Whoo!

212
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:40,083
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:44,212
I'm sure this is not as romantic
as you probably envisioned the prom.

214
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:46,222
Hey, everybody!

215
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:48,986
Denise is so wasted,
she's blowing Brian in the den.

216
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:55,708
- I'm gonna go get the keys
to the master bedroom.
- Okay.

217
00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:58,340
Aaah!
Okay!

218
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:00,783
- Meet me upstairs in five minutes?
- Sure.

219
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:03,718
Sure.

220
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:11,122
Dude! Where's Cindi?

221
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,393
- Shouldn't you be banging her out by now?
- I'm about to bang her out.

222
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,833
- She just went upstairs.
- Yet you look like you're going to a funeral.

223
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:20,599
Tucker, I'm just
dealing with this in my own way.

224
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:23,607
"Dealing with this"?
You're not going upstairs to have surgery.

225
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:26,906
You're going upstairs
to have sex! With a girl!

226
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:31,882
And yeah, she may not be the most attractive
girl in school, but she's a solid, solid seven.

227
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:34,043
What? She's a seven?

228
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:36,587
Look, you've already decided to do this.

229
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:40,090
So you can go and trudge through it like
is a chore and end up hurting her feelings...

230
00:14:40,192 --> 00:14:43,491
or you can go enjoy yourself and have sex.

231
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:45,496
I know, I know.

232
00:14:45,598 --> 00:14:49,329
Look, most guys end up losing their virginity
to some sort of stripper or one-night stand.

233
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:53,462
You're lucky enough to have it be with a
girl that you actually love, and loves you back.

234
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:56,474
You're right. You're right.

235
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:59,977
And that means she may let you do anal.

236
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,480
Thank you, Tucker. That was actually-
That was oddly helpful.

237
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,483
All right. I'm gonna do it.

238
00:15:05,585 --> 00:15:07,485
- I'm gonna do it.
- Yeah!

239
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:09,487
- I'm gonna do it now.
- All right!

240
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:11,489
- I'm gonna have sex.
- Yes, you are.

241
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:15,118
- Oh, my God, I'm nervous.
- That, too, I can help you out with.

242
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:22,034
- A little whiskey always calms the nerves.
- Cheers!

243
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:25,035
You should probably have one more
since this is your first time...

244
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:28,038
'cause you'll explode
as soon as you get it in there.

245
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,041
- Gotta numb the senses.
- Really? That makes sense.

246
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,471
- Whoo!
- I am gonna do it.

247
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:39,312
Go for it, Eugene.
But one more for good luck.

248
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:43,548
Yeah. Good luck to me for having sex!

249
00:15:46,926 --> 00:15:50,987
The next time you see me, I will be a man.

250
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:54,498
Go get 'em, Eugene-Wait!
Thas not the hallway!

251
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,699
Eugene!

252
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:08,605
Whoa. Punked.

253
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:29,599
Okay, buddy, nowjust hold still.

254
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:32,262
I have an idea.

255
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:34,134
And... wake up.

256
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,107
I knew it! I knew it would work.

257
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:41,270
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
- You're alive. Whoa!

258
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,872
What the fuck is going on?

259
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:47,885
- You probably can't move yet. You have atrophy.
- Why can't I move?

260
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:50,080
Why can't I move and hurt you?

261
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:53,454
Because you haven't used your body in,
like, four years. You gotta take it easy.

262
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:56,494
Tucker, whas happening? Why am I here?

263
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:59,496
You fell down the stairs after prom
and were in a coma for four years.

264
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:02,499
Then I saved your life,
because I'm a genius.

265
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:06,002
You! I told you no hit mister with the bat.

266
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:08,630
Juanita, I brought him back to life.

267
00:17:08,741 --> 00:17:12,302
- I told you the bat trick would work.
- Policía. Policía.

268
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:15,244
- What the fuck is going on?
- Eugene, don't do that. You'll overexert yourself.

269
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:21,611
Oh! You're pooping!

270
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:30,576
Your body is in
an extreme state of atrophy...

271
00:17:30,678 --> 00:17:35,308
but you're in surprisingly good shape for
someone who's been in a coma for four years.

272
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,317
You've healed from all the damage
you received in your initial fall...

273
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:41,752
so all that you'll need to recover from
is from the effects of the coma itself.

274
00:17:41,856 --> 00:17:45,121
What about my face?

275
00:17:45,226 --> 00:17:48,127
Yes, well, your nose was broken
by the force of the baseball bat...

276
00:17:48,229 --> 00:17:51,687
and the frontal palate of your skull has
some pretty bad fractures.

277
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:53,426
But we've set most of that.

278
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:56,298
You were hit pretty hard though.

279
00:17:58,372 --> 00:18:00,533
But you'll find over time...

280
00:18:00,641 --> 00:18:03,906
that your muscle strength will return,
as well as bowel control.

281
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:07,640
- Until then, is best
to avoid strenuous situations.

282
00:18:07,748 --> 00:18:09,409
Thas why you pooped.

283
00:18:09,517 --> 00:18:12,042
Yeah.

284
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:15,122
Yeah, you did. A lot.

285
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,515
Lots of poop.

286
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:20,526
Like, almost four years worth of poop.

287
00:18:22,363 --> 00:18:24,593
Should call you Poopy Pants.

288
00:18:24,698 --> 00:18:26,598
Mr. Poopy Pants.

289
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:32,330
Sorry. Anyway, I'll let you get some rest.

290
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,206
I'm sure you and your friend
have some catching up to do.

291
00:18:38,145 --> 00:18:42,047
- Oh, and, Tucker, off the record-
- Yeah?

292
00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:44,174
I like your style.

293
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:50,556
# Fuck me a white-#

294
00:18:50,658 --> 00:18:53,218
I can't believe
I've been here for four years.

295
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:56,558
Yeah. You gotta watch
where you're walking.

296
00:18:56,664 --> 00:18:59,292
It doesn't feel like four years ago.

297
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,460
I feel like just five seconds ago
I was getting wasted with you...

298
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,006
and going upstairs to have sex.

299
00:19:06,106 --> 00:19:09,007
Wait a minute. How come
just you're here? Where's Cindi?

300
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:12,806
- Where's my Dad?
- Oh, his job moved him down to Florida.

301
00:19:12,913 --> 00:19:15,643
What? He left me in the hospital?

302
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:17,478
Well, dude, you were a vegetable.

303
00:19:17,585 --> 00:19:19,610
Besides, he still has an apartment here.

304
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,280
- What about Cindi?
- Oh, I don't know where she is.

305
00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:27,122
- Well, give me your cell phone.
- No, I don't know where she is.
She moved after graduation.

306
00:19:27,228 --> 00:19:29,696
- She left me too?
- You were a vegetable.

307
00:19:29,797 --> 00:19:31,628
Then how come you're still here?

308
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:33,495
'Cause we're homeys, dude. Lock it up.

309
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:35,592
I can't believe she would
just leave me like that.

310
00:19:35,703 --> 00:19:38,103
She was around for a little while...

311
00:19:38,205 --> 00:19:41,971
but then she got into college and it really
didn't look like you were gonna wake up.

312
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:44,977
I mean, it took me four years
to figure out the bat trick.

313
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:47,809
I tried to look her up
about a year or so ago...

314
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:52,215
but she dropped out after freshman year,
and the trail goes cold.

315
00:19:53,854 --> 00:19:56,880
Tucker, I appreciate you
being here. L- I really do.

316
00:19:56,991 --> 00:19:59,892
But I think right now
I just need to be alone for a while.

317
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:01,894
Okay, man.

318
00:20:01,996 --> 00:20:03,896
I'll check on you tomorrow.

319
00:20:03,998 --> 00:20:06,398
Besides, I got a date with the old lady.

320
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,060
Wait. You have a girlfriend?

321
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:11,069
Well, I'm not the kind of guy...

322
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:13,071
that gets chained down to one woman...

323
00:20:13,173 --> 00:20:15,471
but lately I've been banging Candace.

324
00:20:15,576 --> 00:20:17,476
That crazy handicapped chick?

325
00:20:17,578 --> 00:20:19,978
Hey. Epilepsy, dude. Is a condition.

326
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,140
Plus, is kind of hot.
She, like, vibrates.

327
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,649
Nice.

328
00:20:26,421 --> 00:20:28,548
All right.

329
00:20:28,655 --> 00:20:31,647
Okay, looking good. Looking good.

330
00:20:31,758 --> 00:20:34,454
Bobby, you wanna sit up
real straight for me there?

331
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:36,995
- Sit up straight, sweetie.
- All right.

332
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:40,589
Everybody say, "Fuzzy pickles."

333
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:42,896
Fuzzy pickles.

334
00:20:43,003 --> 00:20:44,903
That was great. That was great.

335
00:20:45,005 --> 00:20:50,500
I'm gonna try one more, and let me
work with Mommy for a second.

336
00:20:50,611 --> 00:20:52,272
All right, les see.

337
00:20:52,379 --> 00:20:56,281
Les brush some of this hair away
from Mommy's neck-

338
00:20:56,383 --> 00:20:58,283
Bring out Mommy's pretty neck.

339
00:20:58,385 --> 00:21:01,081
Thas good. Thas good. Okay.

340
00:21:01,188 --> 00:21:04,783
Les have a couple wisps
hang down here by the nape of the neck.

341
00:21:04,892 --> 00:21:07,190
Thas good. That looks great. There we go.

342
00:21:07,294 --> 00:21:11,856
And here, position three-quarters
there like that. Okay? Like that.

343
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:13,933
Thas good. Thas good.

344
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:16,696
- Like that, and-
- Okay, okay.

345
00:21:16,803 --> 00:21:20,000
- Okay, thas enough playful, pal.
- Is gonna be good.

346
00:21:20,107 --> 00:21:22,507
All right, stay like that.

347
00:21:22,609 --> 00:21:26,511
Is gonna be good. Okay, now
everybody say, "Mommy's a vision."

348
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:29,377
Mommy's a vision.

349
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:33,418
Do not run away.
Hey, this is big-time stuff.

350
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,420
Mr. Biederman is extremely upset.

351
00:21:35,522 --> 00:21:39,151
He brings his family in for a photo
and you turn that into soft-core pornography.

352
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:41,159
He's crazy. I think he does drugs.

353
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:44,162
Well, he said that you unbuttoned
his wife's shirt.

354
00:21:44,264 --> 00:21:47,165
He said you handed her
your phone number as she was leaving.

355
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:49,667
- What the "H", bro? Come on!
- Some mail came for you.

356
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,670
Sweet. New Playboy.

357
00:21:51,772 --> 00:21:54,673
How many times have I told you not to
have that delivered here? About a million?

358
00:21:54,775 --> 00:21:57,676
Why doesn't anybody
listen to me, ever? Jesus!

359
00:21:57,778 --> 00:21:59,541
Oh, my God.

360
00:21:59,646 --> 00:22:01,477
What?

361
00:22:01,582 --> 00:22:03,573
Pack your bags, Eugene. I found her.

362
00:22:03,684 --> 00:22:06,585
- No, no, no. You cannot be here.
- Juanita, vámonos.

363
00:22:06,687 --> 00:22:08,780
- I found Cindi.
- What? Where?

364
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:11,289
Right there.

365
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,090
Mierda.

366
00:22:17,764 --> 00:22:19,994
I can't believe Cindi would do this.

367
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,500
She's changed, man. She's all growed up.

368
00:22:22,603 --> 00:22:24,901
The girl next door is now
one of The Girls Next Door.

369
00:22:25,005 --> 00:22:28,702
Oh, my God. It says one ofher likes
is sex on the beach.

370
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:31,073
Calm down. That could just be the drink.

371
00:22:31,178 --> 00:22:34,341
Tucker, do you think
that Cindi's still a virgin?

372
00:22:34,448 --> 00:22:36,348
Les see.

373
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,920
No, afraid not.

374
00:22:42,022 --> 00:22:44,217
- Oh, my God.
- This is perfect.

375
00:22:44,324 --> 00:22:46,224
How is this perfect?

376
00:22:46,326 --> 00:22:49,727
This Saturday is Playboy's
annual anniversary bash.

377
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,730
So?

378
00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:54,733
So, this Saturday
all the Playmates, including Cindi...

379
00:22:54,835 --> 00:22:56,735
are gonna be at the Playboy Mansion...

380
00:22:56,837 --> 00:22:59,897
mingling with guests,
sipping slightly alcoholic beverages.

381
00:23:01,141 --> 00:23:03,132
- Yeah, but, Tucker-
- Dude, this is meant to be.

382
00:23:03,243 --> 00:23:05,768
What are the odds that this issue would
come out right now...

383
00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:07,779
as you're getting out of your coma?

384
00:23:07,881 --> 00:23:09,781
I guess.

385
00:23:09,883 --> 00:23:12,784
This is true love speaking. True love doesn't
speak often, but is speaking to us now.

386
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:15,411
Is telling us to go
to the Playboy Mansion.

387
00:23:15,522 --> 00:23:17,786
Yeah, but, Tucker,
I can't even walk here, man.

388
00:23:17,891 --> 00:23:20,826
- You're getting a little better every day, right?
- Yeah.

389
00:23:20,927 --> 00:23:24,294
So the party's Saturday night. That means
we have to catch a plane Saturday morning.

390
00:23:24,398 --> 00:23:27,959
Is Thursday today, so that gives us
three days to get you on your feet.

391
00:23:28,068 --> 00:23:30,229
Think you can do it?

392
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:32,305
- I can try.
- Yes! Thas the spirit!

393
00:23:32,406 --> 00:23:34,397
We're going to the Playboy Mansion!

394
00:23:34,508 --> 00:23:37,500
- Yeah! Playboy.
- Ow!

395
00:24:17,684 --> 00:24:20,983
Mister, you have a telephone call from a Mr. Bell.

396
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,517
- Dad?
- Eugene?

397
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,752
- Hey, sport.
- Hey, Dad.

398
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:31,763
I can't tell you how glad I was when
they told me you came out of that coma.

399
00:24:31,865 --> 00:24:35,062
- Thas great. Thas really great.
- Yeah.

400
00:24:35,168 --> 00:24:37,728
Um, is been weird here.

401
00:24:37,838 --> 00:24:41,330
This actually works out great, 'cause I'm
gonna be up there in a few weeks on business.

402
00:24:41,441 --> 00:24:43,466
In a few weeks?

403
00:24:43,577 --> 00:24:45,807
Thas right, buddy.

404
00:24:45,912 --> 00:24:48,813
Oh, wait a minute.
I'm getting another call.

405
00:24:48,915 --> 00:24:51,816
- You know what? Is Japan.
I'm gonna have to take this.
- Okay.

406
00:24:51,918 --> 00:24:54,113
Okay, but in a few weeks-

407
00:24:54,221 --> 00:24:56,212
What?

408
00:24:56,323 --> 00:24:59,224
Oh, shit. Is this still Eugene? Hold on.

409
00:25:10,537 --> 00:25:12,334
Whoa.

410
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:17,570
Wow. This is the nicest place
you've ever taken me to, Tucker.

411
00:25:17,677 --> 00:25:20,202
Yeah. They don't even have a drive-through.

412
00:25:20,313 --> 00:25:22,110
Sir, may I help you?

413
00:25:22,215 --> 00:25:26,117
Yeah, we'll take a plate
ofTater-Tots and... Jäger?

414
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:29,518
- TwoJägers.
- Excellent choice, sir.

415
00:25:29,623 --> 00:25:33,423
- Wanna get your picture taken with the waiter?
- Could I?

416
00:25:37,063 --> 00:25:39,054
Come on, closer.

417
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:41,691
And-

418
00:25:41,802 --> 00:25:44,566
- Awesome.
- Very good.

419
00:25:46,306 --> 00:25:49,537
So, Tucker, I got you
an anniversary present.

420
00:25:49,643 --> 00:25:52,134
I know. I'm sorry.

421
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:55,737
I know how you feel about that term,
but it was 13 months ago tonight that-

422
00:25:55,849 --> 00:25:59,012
That we did each other for the first time.

423
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:02,646
Yes, that we did each other
for the first time.

424
00:26:02,756 --> 00:26:05,919
This is just a little something
to say that is been a great 13 months.

425
00:26:06,026 --> 00:26:09,792
- Thank you.
- Cool! A card.

426
00:26:12,265 --> 00:26:14,233
Is there a check?

427
00:26:14,334 --> 00:26:17,997
No, there's no check.
Is an anniversary card.

428
00:26:22,943 --> 00:26:25,241
You got me the Black Billiard.

429
00:26:25,345 --> 00:26:28,178
This is just like the pipe
that Hugh Hefner used to smoke.

430
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:30,408
I know.

431
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,515
Candace, you're, like,
so totally the coolest girl in the world.

432
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,490
So, where are we going after this?

433
00:26:40,594 --> 00:26:43,495
Don't you worry about it, babe.
I got it all planned out.

434
00:26:43,597 --> 00:26:45,462
Tonight is gonna be awesome.

435
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:56,275
What was that? Who is that?

436
00:26:57,444 --> 00:27:00,641
What the fuck?

437
00:27:00,747 --> 00:27:03,307
- Tucker?
- We gotta go, man. Get your stuff.

438
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:06,510
- What are you talking about? Whas going on?
- We gotta go. Now, now, now.

439
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,520
- We're not leaving till Saturday.
- Plans change.

440
00:27:08,622 --> 00:27:10,453
I'm not ready!

441
00:27:12,425 --> 00:27:15,292
No. No! You can't be here! He's stealing the mister!

442
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:17,295
Tucker, what the fuck is going on?

443
00:27:17,397 --> 00:27:20,127
We have to get out of town.
I'll explain in the car.

444
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:22,724
- Get out of town?
- There he is! That son of a bitch!

445
00:27:22,836 --> 00:27:25,202
- Detour, Eugene.
- Let me at him.

446
00:27:26,406 --> 00:27:30,172
You're a dead man,
Tucker Cleigh! A dead man!

447
00:27:30,277 --> 00:27:32,745
- Mister!
- Tucker, what the hell is happening?

448
00:27:32,846 --> 00:27:35,906
Ah! Jesus! Oww!

449
00:27:36,016 --> 00:27:38,678
- There's a ramp right there!
- No time for the ramp.

450
00:27:38,785 --> 00:27:40,685
Hey, hey, take it easy. Hey!

451
00:27:40,787 --> 00:27:42,687
Oww!

452
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:44,689
Tucker, I can't even walk here.

453
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:47,692
If I take a shit in your car,
is gonna be a pretty short trip.

454
00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:51,497
Stop! You can't take the mister!

455
00:27:51,598 --> 00:27:54,123
Policla! He's not ready.

456
00:27:54,234 --> 00:27:58,762
- Good-bye, Juanita.
I'll bring him back in one piece.

457
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:07,811
Pendejo.

458
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,421
Okay, Tucker, what is going on?
Whas wrong with your balls?

459
00:28:16,523 --> 00:28:19,754
- I got to get rid of this cell phone.
They can track it.
- What are you talking about?

460
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:22,259
Whas going on? Slow down
and tell me what happened.

461
00:28:22,362 --> 00:28:24,922
- I had a problem with Candace.
- Obviously.

462
00:28:25,031 --> 00:28:26,862
What kind of problem?

463
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:28,867
Well, it was the 13-month anniversary...

464
00:28:28,969 --> 00:28:31,096
of when Candace and I
first started boning.

465
00:28:31,204 --> 00:28:34,139
- Okay.
- So I wanted to do something
really nice and special.

466
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,643
So we got tanked at this really nice
restaurant and then ditched out on the check.

467
00:28:38,745 --> 00:28:42,738
Then we poured some Maker's into a 3-liter of
Coke and did donuts in the Wendy's parking lot.

468
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:44,749
It was pretty sweet.

469
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:48,446
Everything was going great.
Then I went to give her her present.

470
00:28:48,555 --> 00:28:51,456
Come into the living room.
I got you something.

471
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:54,026
Oh, Tucker, thas so sweet.

472
00:28:54,127 --> 00:28:57,096
- What is it? What is it?
- Ta-da!

473
00:28:57,197 --> 00:28:59,131
Apole?

474
00:28:59,232 --> 00:29:01,132
A stripper pole.

475
00:29:01,234 --> 00:29:03,134
A stripper pole?

476
00:29:03,236 --> 00:29:05,534
Happy 13 months boning.

477
00:29:05,638 --> 00:29:07,970
- Tucker.
- Come on, go do a dance.

478
00:29:08,074 --> 00:29:10,804
Do a sexy strip dance or something.

479
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:14,579
I don't know.

480
00:29:14,681 --> 00:29:16,581
Miss January of this year...

481
00:29:16,683 --> 00:29:19,584
said that 90% of the reason
that relationships fall apart...

482
00:29:19,686 --> 00:29:22,086
is because people don't
spice up the bedroom.

483
00:29:22,188 --> 00:29:24,452
- We're in the living room.
- I know.

484
00:29:28,828 --> 00:29:31,592
Huh? Come on, give it a spin.

485
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:36,100
Come on.

486
00:29:36,202 --> 00:29:38,762
Yeah, there you go.

487
00:29:55,922 --> 00:29:58,982
#I love myself
I want you to love me #

488
00:29:59,092 --> 00:30:03,153
- # When I'm feelin'down I want you above me #
- Yeah, go on.

489
00:30:03,263 --> 00:30:06,391
#I search myself
I want you to find me #

490
00:30:06,499 --> 00:30:11,994
#I forget myself
I want you to remind me #

491
00:30:12,105 --> 00:30:15,131
Go on.

492
00:30:15,241 --> 00:30:18,233
So anyway, then she kind of
started to get into it.

493
00:30:18,344 --> 00:30:20,073
#Anybody else #

494
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,207
#When I think about you
I touch myself, ohh-ohh-oh #

495
00:30:24,317 --> 00:30:27,184
You look so awesome right now!

496
00:30:27,287 --> 00:30:30,518
Then she started to, like, really
get into it. Man, it was awesome.

497
00:30:30,623 --> 00:30:34,753
She was whipping her hair around,
sticking her butt up in the air.

498
00:30:46,372 --> 00:30:48,567
Okay.

499
00:30:48,675 --> 00:30:51,644
Then she started to go downtown,
if you know what I mean.

500
00:30:53,213 --> 00:30:55,181
Yeah, I know what you mean.

501
00:31:01,354 --> 00:31:04,016
Oh, that feels good.

502
00:31:04,124 --> 00:31:06,524
Oh, thas great.

503
00:31:06,626 --> 00:31:08,560
Oh, thas awesome.

504
00:31:08,661 --> 00:31:11,687
Man, it was great.
Perfect form, lots of tongue.

505
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:14,596
Hey, check it out. Strobe lights.

506
00:31:17,804 --> 00:31:22,400
You're biting! You're biting! Candace?
You're biting, Candace!

507
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:26,206
You're biting! Candace!
You're biting me! Candace!

508
00:31:26,312 --> 00:31:28,610
I don't know.
Candace must just hate strobe lights.

509
00:31:28,715 --> 00:31:30,808
Tucker, that was probably the epilepsy.

510
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:31,975
Don't make jokes, man.

511
00:31:33,485 --> 00:31:38,548
I didn't know what to do, so I panicked
and I grabbed a fork off the counter...

512
00:31:38,656 --> 00:31:41,147
and I stabbed her in the face!

513
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:42,692
- Oh, my God!
- I know!

514
00:31:42,794 --> 00:31:44,694
I didn't know what to do. I panicked.

515
00:31:44,796 --> 00:31:48,527
- So you stabbed her?
- I thought she was gonna bite my dick clear off.

516
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:50,897
- Oh, my God!
- I know!

517
00:31:51,002 --> 00:31:53,232
No wonder she looked so pissed off.

518
00:31:53,338 --> 00:31:56,739
Okay, thas terrible, but why
do we have to get out of town like this?

519
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:03,177
- Oh, no! Her brother!
- You're gonna die tonight, Tucker Cleigh.

520
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:05,374
Her brother's a fireman.

521
00:32:05,483 --> 00:32:07,883
Have you ever met one of them?
They're crazy.

522
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,418
- They must have put an A.P.B. Out on my plates.
- What?

523
00:32:30,308 --> 00:32:32,776
Roll up your window! Roll up your window!

524
00:32:43,154 --> 00:32:46,055
Whas he gonna do now?

525
00:32:49,794 --> 00:32:52,024
Tucker, do something!

526
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:09,059
Stupid firemen.

527
00:33:09,162 --> 00:33:11,824
- Can't turn their trucks around.
- My God.

528
00:33:24,944 --> 00:33:28,778
Okay, Tucker, have you put
any thought into this at all?

529
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:32,476
The Playboy Mansion is on the other side
of the country. Thas a long way to drive.

530
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:35,110
Well, the country is,
like, 10 states wide.

531
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,281
Each state is roughly a hundred miles across,
so thas like a thousand miles.

532
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,291
We're moving at 60 miles an hour.

533
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:43,851
We should be there in, like, 600 minutes.

534
00:33:43,963 --> 00:33:46,864
Okay, well, not one part of that
was correct, so let me ask you this.

535
00:33:46,966 --> 00:33:49,867
Have you thought about how we're gonna
get into the mansion once we arrive?

536
00:33:51,971 --> 00:33:54,735
- # I'm-a love a white girl
I'm-a love a white girl #

537
00:33:54,841 --> 00:33:57,435
Wait a minute. Is this Horsedick?

538
00:33:57,543 --> 00:34:00,273
- Dot-MPEG.
- Dot-MPEG.

539
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:04,282
- Did he change his lyrics?
- Yeah, this is the radio-friendly version.

540
00:34:04,384 --> 00:34:06,284
Wait a minute. Horsedick's on the radio?

541
00:34:06,386 --> 00:34:09,446
Yeah, man. He blew up.
He's like the biggest star on the planet.

542
00:34:09,555 --> 00:34:12,353
They even play his song
during Monday Night Football.

543
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:14,358
I'm asleep for four years.

544
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:18,191
My dad moves out of town, my girlfrienïs
in Playboy, and your stupid friend is famous.

545
00:34:18,297 --> 00:34:20,527
Yep. Is kind of like
when Han got unfrozen in Jedi.

546
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:24,433
Yeah, is exactly like
when Han got unfrozen in Jedi.

547
00:34:24,537 --> 00:34:27,370
Yo, whas up, everybody? You know who that was.

548
00:34:27,473 --> 00:34:30,203
Horsedick. MPEG with the track
"I'm-a Love a White Girl';...

549
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:31,970
offhis multi-platinum CD Donkey Dong.

550
00:34:32,078 --> 00:34:34,979
Pick it up if you ain't heard.

551
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:38,608
Wait a minute. If Horsedick's
the most famous person in the world...

552
00:34:38,718 --> 00:34:41,619
then he could get into
the Playboy Mansion, right?

553
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:44,690
Oh, yeah. He could just walk right in.

554
00:34:51,497 --> 00:34:55,228
We should totally get
Horsedick. MPEG to get us in!

555
00:34:55,334 --> 00:34:58,235
He lives in Chicago. He's always
trying to get me to come up and visit.

556
00:34:58,337 --> 00:35:00,771
He'd be totally down to fly us
out to L.A. And hook us up.

557
00:35:00,873 --> 00:35:03,137
Good idea, Tucker.

558
00:35:03,242 --> 00:35:07,804
Okay. Well, at least we have
a plan now- Horsedick.

559
00:35:07,914 --> 00:35:10,280
Thas our plan. Horsedick.

560
00:35:10,383 --> 00:35:12,817
- Dot-MPEG.
- Dot-MPEG.

561
00:35:13,052 --> 00:35:14,815
All points bulletin.

562
00:35:14,921 --> 00:35:17,287
Be on the lookout for a Tucker Cleigh.

563
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:21,326
White male, six foot five.
No visible tattoos.

564
00:35:21,427 --> 00:35:23,418
Last seen April 17.

565
00:35:23,529 --> 00:35:26,430
I just can't believe
the firemen were that angry.

566
00:35:26,532 --> 00:35:28,932
Dude, firemen
breathe noxious fumes all day.

567
00:35:29,035 --> 00:35:31,936
Is their job. Makes them psycho.

568
00:35:32,038 --> 00:35:33,938
I guess that makes sense.

569
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,237
Trust me, dude. Firemen are bad news.

570
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,676
Hey, Tucker, I don't really want
to go in there dressed like this.

571
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:45,046
Can you get me like a shirt, some pants,
and I think a hoodie would be good.

572
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:47,585
Sure, no sweat. Just fill her up for me.

573
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,655
Wh- No! Tucker!

574
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:51,950
I have atrophy!

575
00:36:19,018 --> 00:36:21,509
Ridiculous.

576
00:36:43,276 --> 00:36:45,244
Whoa.

577
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,714
Hugh.

578
00:37:37,997 --> 00:37:39,897
Hey, this is Candace.

579
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:44,902
I can't come to the phone right now because
I'm out hunting down my piece-of-shit boyfriend.

580
00:37:45,004 --> 00:37:48,030
Leave a message.

581
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,337
Uh, h-hi, Candace.

582
00:37:51,444 --> 00:37:54,379
Thas a-Thas a pretty funny message.

583
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,471
Um, look...

584
00:37:56,582 --> 00:38:01,281
I-I just wanted to call
and talk about what you did.

585
00:38:01,387 --> 00:38:06,848
Um, I want you to know
that I'm not mad at you...

586
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:10,861
and I realize that you seemed...

587
00:38:10,963 --> 00:38:13,056
a little...

588
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,065
cross.

589
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:18,568
And I may have overreacted
a little bit to you biting me.

590
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,572
But... you know how I am.

591
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:26,634
My brain just shuts down whenever
I feel like I'm close to getting some.

592
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,843
Anyway, I just-

593
00:38:31,951 --> 00:38:36,547
I hope this doesn't get in the way of us
hooking up and hanging out and stuff-

594
00:38:38,658 --> 00:38:41,627
Because I really like doing that.

595
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:48,028
I mean, not like we're
exclusive or anything.

596
00:38:48,134 --> 00:38:51,035
By the way, did your answering machine
say "my boyfriend"?

597
00:38:51,137 --> 00:38:53,037
Because-weird.

598
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:55,198
I mean, we've talked about that.

599
00:38:55,308 --> 00:38:59,210
Um, anyway, I guess
I'm just trying to say...

600
00:38:59,312 --> 00:39:01,371
I forgive you.

601
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,040
I just hope...

602
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:07,051
you're not gonna be a dick about this.

603
00:39:07,153 --> 00:39:09,121
Okay, bye.

604
00:39:19,298 --> 00:39:22,734
Well, I think I patched
things up with Candace.

605
00:39:22,835 --> 00:39:24,860
Why is your dress all wet?

606
00:39:25,971 --> 00:39:27,871
Give me my clothes.

607
00:39:39,952 --> 00:39:42,113
Really?

608
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:44,519
That shirs awesome, man.

609
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:49,389
I'm getting pretty tired.

610
00:39:49,495 --> 00:39:52,931
- Do you want to get a motel or something?
- No, man, I'm wired.

611
00:39:53,032 --> 00:39:56,229
I ate, like, 10 packets of those Horny Goat
Weed stamina things at the gas station.

612
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:58,462
You can get some shut-eye though.

613
00:39:59,638 --> 00:40:03,631
All right, just wake me
if you need me, okay?

614
00:40:03,743 --> 00:40:05,870
And, Tucker...

615
00:40:05,978 --> 00:40:09,379
thank you for everything.

616
00:40:09,482 --> 00:40:11,575
No problem, dude.
We're homeys. Lock it up.

617
00:40:11,684 --> 00:40:13,584
Hey! Hey!

618
00:40:13,686 --> 00:40:16,211
- Whoa! Sorry.
- Asshole.

619
00:40:16,322 --> 00:40:18,552
Just watch the road. Okay?

620
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:20,625
Will do.

621
00:40:21,827 --> 00:40:23,795
Good night.

622
00:40:37,076 --> 00:40:39,067
Hey, Eugene.

623
00:40:39,178 --> 00:40:41,942
- Want to party?
- Cindi.

624
00:40:42,047 --> 00:40:47,349
I got tired of waiting for you,
Eugene, so I went out and I blew everyone.

625
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:50,945
- No! Cindi!
- Why did you have to get drunk, Eugene?

626
00:40:51,056 --> 00:40:54,617
- Why couldn't you just make love to me?
- No! I'm sorry!

627
00:40:54,727 --> 00:40:57,457
You've turned me into a whore, Eugene.

628
00:40:57,563 --> 00:41:00,589
This is a venereal disease, Eugene...

629
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:03,133
and I have thousands of them.

630
00:41:03,235 --> 00:41:05,931
- No!
- I'm just like your brother, Eugene!

631
00:41:06,038 --> 00:41:09,007
Just like your brother!

632
00:41:09,108 --> 00:41:10,939
No!

633
00:41:19,118 --> 00:41:20,881
What state are we in?

634
00:41:22,755 --> 00:41:25,656
- Hey. Tucker.
- What?

635
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,060
Sorry about that.

636
00:41:30,162 --> 00:41:34,155
I started drinking all this NyQuil because that
Horny Goat Weed was giving me the jitters.

637
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:36,996
There's clothes in this bag if you want them.

638
00:41:37,102 --> 00:41:39,662
But I feel good to go now.
We don't need to stay here.

639
00:41:39,772 --> 00:41:43,208
Tucker, you can't drive all night long
without sleep. Is not safe.

640
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:46,210
I got some sleep in the car. I'm serious.

641
00:41:46,312 --> 00:41:49,213
We could go get our money back
from the motel, jump back in the car...

642
00:41:49,315 --> 00:41:53,081
be in Chicago in a couple hours, and then
by this time tomorrow be at the mansion.

643
00:41:53,185 --> 00:41:55,050
Tucker, is 4:00 in the morning.

644
00:41:55,154 --> 00:41:57,054
The stupid fucking mansion can wait.

645
00:41:58,157 --> 00:42:00,250
The stupid what-ing mansion?

646
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:02,259
Oh, God.

647
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:04,886
That mansion is a historical
and cultural landmark...

648
00:42:04,997 --> 00:42:08,398
where some of the greatest minds
have gathered to exchange ideas and-

649
00:42:08,501 --> 00:42:11,197
And watch naked ladies
take baths together. Yes, I know.

650
00:42:11,303 --> 00:42:14,670
Oh, my God. You don't know.

651
00:42:14,773 --> 00:42:17,867
I need to give you a crash course
in sophistication and the Playboy way.

652
00:42:17,977 --> 00:42:20,411
You're gonna give me
a lesson in sophistication?

653
00:42:20,513 --> 00:42:24,574
Yeah. I've had a subscription
to this magazine for, like, 13 years.

654
00:42:24,683 --> 00:42:28,244
God, you're right, Tucker.
Teach me more about etiquette.

655
00:42:28,354 --> 00:42:30,254
Okay.

656
00:42:30,356 --> 00:42:32,221
Here, put this on.

657
00:42:32,324 --> 00:42:34,519
Ow. I don't wanna.

658
00:42:34,627 --> 00:42:36,754
Put it on.

659
00:42:36,862 --> 00:42:41,424
This is a bathrobe. We'll probably be issued
one of these when we get to the mansion.

660
00:42:41,534 --> 00:42:43,729
Is the western equivalent
of the Greek toga.

661
00:42:43,836 --> 00:42:45,736
There's a stain on mine.

662
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:48,864
It signifies both power and leisure.

663
00:42:48,974 --> 00:42:50,874
Say that with me-

664
00:42:50,976 --> 00:42:53,604
power and leisure.

665
00:42:53,712 --> 00:42:56,738
Say it. Power and leisure.

666
00:42:56,849 --> 00:42:58,407
Power and leisure.

667
00:42:58,517 --> 00:43:00,109
Good. Now, lesson two.

668
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:03,120
When you get to the mansion
and you see a pretty girl...

669
00:43:03,222 --> 00:43:05,918
you can't just walk up to her
and ask her to have sex with you.

670
00:43:06,025 --> 00:43:08,459
Okay.

671
00:43:08,561 --> 00:43:11,462
You have to engage her in
stimulating conversation first.

672
00:43:11,564 --> 00:43:13,464
Find out who she is.

673
00:43:13,566 --> 00:43:15,864
Ask her questions like
what is her favorite animal...

674
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,936
or whas her most embarrassing moment?

675
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:22,469
This is a pipe.

676
00:43:22,575 --> 00:43:26,875
Smoking a pipe is the equivalent
of wearing a fine tuxedo.

677
00:43:30,382 --> 00:43:32,145
Tucker!

678
00:43:43,262 --> 00:43:45,890
- This usually never happens.
- Shut up, Tucker.

679
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:54,762
Uh-oh, dude, here come the firemen.

680
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:14,254
Uh-oh, dude, here come the firemen.

681
00:44:15,594 --> 00:44:18,654
They know about Candace!

682
00:44:21,066 --> 00:44:23,500
Come on. Get in.

683
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:27,534
- We must be three states away!
- Firemen talk, dude.

684
00:44:28,841 --> 00:44:31,332
You're a dead man, Tucker Cleigh!

685
00:44:57,936 --> 00:44:59,904
How's that atrophy coming?

686
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,712
Are you still mad?

687
00:45:13,285 --> 00:45:16,686
Hey, do you want to
get something to eat or anything?

688
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:18,689
Well, how much money do we have?

689
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:23,854
Because we just spent 75 bucks on a motel
room that we got to use for all of five minutes.

690
00:45:23,962 --> 00:45:27,125
Les see. I've got... seven dollars.

691
00:45:27,232 --> 00:45:29,928
Do you have any money?

692
00:45:30,035 --> 00:45:32,833
No, I don't have any money.
I don't have a bank account.

693
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:36,430
I've been in a coma since high school.

694
00:45:36,542 --> 00:45:38,442
Okay. Seven bucks.

695
00:45:38,544 --> 00:45:41,411
Seven bucks should be enough
to feed the both of us.

696
00:45:52,605 --> 00:45:55,733
- Are you mad?
- Yes, I'm mad!

697
00:45:55,841 --> 00:45:59,868
What kind of fuckin' idiot goes on a
cross-country road trip with less than $100?

698
00:45:59,979 --> 00:46:03,176
Well, to be fair, dude,
I had to buy you all those clothes...

699
00:46:03,282 --> 00:46:06,342
and you're the one
that wanted to stay at the motel.

700
00:46:06,452 --> 00:46:09,683
You had to buy clothes for me
because you kidnapped me...

701
00:46:09,789 --> 00:46:13,054
and I wanted the motel
because you almost killed me!

702
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:16,492
But then wait! You burned down the motel
and almost killed me yet again.

703
00:46:16,595 --> 00:46:21,692
And then you pissed off firemen
and almost got me killed yet another time!

704
00:46:21,801 --> 00:46:25,897
- I think you're overreacting a little bit.
- I am not overreacting!

705
00:46:26,005 --> 00:46:30,169
I am trying to reclaim my life here, Tucker,
and you're not taking this seriously.

706
00:46:30,276 --> 00:46:33,143
This is all some dumb excuse
for you to go to the mansion...

707
00:46:33,245 --> 00:46:37,773
so you can finally rub up on all those strippers
you've been dreaming about your whole life.

708
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:43,577
Rub up? Strippers?

709
00:46:43,689 --> 00:46:46,123
We talked about this last night...

710
00:46:46,225 --> 00:46:49,319
and I will not allow that sort of filth
or degrading speech...

711
00:46:49,428 --> 00:46:51,328
in my car!

712
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:53,330
Oh, look! Horsedick.

713
00:47:23,295 --> 00:47:25,855
- Speak.
- Just got a visual confirmation.

714
00:47:25,965 --> 00:47:28,229
They've been spotted
in Chicago.

715
00:47:31,003 --> 00:47:34,905
#Uh, wh-what did you say #

716
00:47:35,007 --> 00:47:37,532
#You know who it is #

717
00:47:39,945 --> 00:47:41,708
# Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

718
00:47:41,814 --> 00:47:44,442
# Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

719
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:46,882
# Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

720
00:47:46,986 --> 00:47:49,511
# Suck upon my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

721
00:47:49,622 --> 00:47:51,954
# Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

722
00:47:52,057 --> 00:47:54,218
# Suck upon my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

723
00:47:54,326 --> 00:47:56,760
# Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

724
00:47:56,862 --> 00:47:59,194
# Suck upon my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

725
00:47:59,298 --> 00:48:01,698
#Your dick while you fuck my ass #

726
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,928
- Yeah. Quit singin'-
- #Your dick while you fuck my ass #

727
00:48:05,037 --> 00:48:07,369
- and suck my dick.
- #Your dick while you fuck my ass, hey #

728
00:48:07,473 --> 00:48:10,408
- You know, these lyrics don't even make any sense.
- What?

729
00:48:10,509 --> 00:48:12,909
Shut up, Eugene.
This song is awesome.

730
00:48:13,012 --> 00:48:16,175
I wish Candace were here.
She would love this song.

731
00:48:16,282 --> 00:48:19,581
Tucker, if Candace were here right now,
she would try and kill you.

732
00:48:19,685 --> 00:48:22,051
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

733
00:48:22,154 --> 00:48:24,588
# Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

734
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:27,284
# Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

735
00:48:27,393 --> 00:48:29,623
# Suck upon my dick
while I fuck that ass #

736
00:48:29,728 --> 00:48:32,094
#Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

737
00:48:32,198 --> 00:48:34,428
# Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

738
00:48:34,533 --> 00:48:37,229
# Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

739
00:48:37,336 --> 00:48:39,531
# Suck upon my dick
while I fuck that ass, hey #

740
00:48:39,638 --> 00:48:42,198
Bitch!
#That ass, hey #

741
00:48:42,308 --> 00:48:44,776
#Suck my dick
while I fuck that ass ##

742
00:48:46,412 --> 00:48:48,312
Respect.

743
00:48:48,414 --> 00:48:51,076
Cut. Thas a wrap.

744
00:48:51,183 --> 00:48:53,743
Great job, Horsedick. MPEG.
Hip-hop is back!

745
00:48:53,852 --> 00:48:55,877
- You think they're gonna get the message though?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

746
00:48:55,988 --> 00:48:57,888
- Yo, Horsedick.
- Yo, yo, yo.

747
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:59,924
You know these dudes, man?

748
00:49:00,025 --> 00:49:03,461
Hell, yeah! Tucker Cleigh
from the down S. C!

749
00:49:03,562 --> 00:49:06,554
What up, brother?

750
00:49:06,665 --> 00:49:10,101
- How you feel, man?
- Great, man. Thanks for letting us visit your shoot.

751
00:49:10,202 --> 00:49:11,726
- Of course. Any time.
- You remember Eugene from prom?

752
00:49:13,489 --> 00:49:16,515
- Oh, the Stairmaster. How you doin', man?
- Good.

753
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:18,923
I heard you was all
Regarding Henry and shit.

754
00:49:19,027 --> 00:49:22,360
- Yeah, I was in a coma for a while.
- Thas cool.

755
00:49:22,464 --> 00:49:24,489
I see you've been doin' really well.
Congratulations.

756
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:28,729
Thanks, bro. Man, my last CD dropped,
motherfuckers got killed at the Tower Records.

757
00:49:28,837 --> 00:49:32,034
- Motherfuckers got killed!
- Whoa. Thas awesome.

758
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,405
Thank God. You know what I'm sayin'?
What brings y'all to Chicago?

759
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:38,035
- We just came to see you, dog.
- Okay.

760
00:49:38,146 --> 00:49:40,046
Dude.

761
00:49:40,148 --> 00:49:42,742
Oh, and we were wondering if you could
get us into the Playboy Mansion.

762
00:49:42,851 --> 00:49:44,079
Most definitely.

763
00:49:46,187 --> 00:49:50,248
Wow, Horsedick. You're very generous with
your time and resources.

764
00:49:50,358 --> 00:49:53,885
Anything for my bro, man.
Come on. Lock it up. Come on. Lock it up.

765
00:49:53,995 --> 00:49:56,520
See? I told you Horsedick
would hook us up.

766
00:49:56,631 --> 00:50:00,965
We're gonna have you back in Cindi's arms
in no time. Then you can finally have sex.

767
00:50:03,171 --> 00:50:05,469
Finally have sex? You a virgin?

768
00:50:07,309 --> 00:50:10,437
Are you tellin' me you're-Turn the music off!

769
00:50:10,545 --> 00:50:13,912
Do you mean to tell me
you have never been with a woman?

770
00:50:14,015 --> 00:50:16,108
Never?

771
00:50:16,217 --> 00:50:19,243
I was going to in high school,
but, uh, then I fell down the stairs.

772
00:50:19,354 --> 00:50:21,982
Crystal! Janine!

773
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:25,491
Get your asses in here
and have sex with this man!

774
00:50:25,593 --> 00:50:28,289
- Oh, no, Horsedick.
- Dot-MPEG.

775
00:50:28,396 --> 00:50:30,728
Dot-MPEG, yes. Thas not necessary.

776
00:50:30,832 --> 00:50:33,767
I'm saving myself, uh,
for my girlfriend...

777
00:50:33,868 --> 00:50:35,335
who's gonna be at the party...

778
00:50:35,437 --> 00:50:38,270
so thank you, but I'm gonna wait.

779
00:50:40,742 --> 00:50:43,609
- I'll have sex with those girls.
- Come hook my brother up.

780
00:50:43,712 --> 00:50:45,441
I gotta take a shit.

781
00:50:45,547 --> 00:50:47,811
- You okay with just Crystal?
- Yeah, thas cool.

782
00:50:48,883 --> 00:50:50,976
Come on, baby.

783
00:50:55,256 --> 00:50:58,851
You and me gonna have a long talk.

784
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,158
We gonna smoke this here,
and you gonna tell Uncle Horsedick...

785
00:51:03,264 --> 00:51:05,425
exactly what the problem is.

786
00:51:05,533 --> 00:51:09,299
Thank you again,
Horsedick. MPEG, but I don't smoke.

787
00:51:09,404 --> 00:51:10,996
Look here, man.

788
00:51:11,106 --> 00:51:13,734
This is a party bus.

789
00:51:13,842 --> 00:51:17,539
There's only one rule on a party bus-
You got to party.

790
00:51:17,645 --> 00:51:21,274
So you're either gonna fuck
one of them girls, or you smoke this "J."

791
00:51:21,383 --> 00:51:24,477
We out of toilet paper.

792
00:51:32,093 --> 00:51:33,993
#Bounce that, bounce that #

793
00:51:34,095 --> 00:51:36,620
#Know that I'm a better man #

794
00:51:38,233 --> 00:51:40,633
#So now you can know my name #

795
00:51:40,735 --> 00:51:44,000
#Girl, you gotta bounce that #

796
00:51:44,105 --> 00:51:45,868
#Nonstop to the break of dawn #

797
00:51:45,974 --> 00:51:48,306
#Know that I'm a better man #

798
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:51,243
#Whoa, whoa #

799
00:51:51,346 --> 00:51:53,576
I gotta warn you,
I'm a little drunk, so...

800
00:51:53,681 --> 00:51:55,649
this could take two or three minutes.

801
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,947
- # Sittin'on the pillow like a porno star#
- Shh.

802
00:51:59,053 --> 00:52:01,419
#See-through panties
and a push-up bra #

803
00:52:01,523 --> 00:52:03,218
#Look so good #

804
00:52:07,962 --> 00:52:12,296
I don't understand it. I mean, how much
can a person change in four years?

805
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,368
Is, like, I knew her.

806
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:17,233
You know, like, I really knew her.

807
00:52:17,338 --> 00:52:22,241
Then you wake up,
and she's a completely different person.

808
00:52:24,779 --> 00:52:27,213
This bitch one time...

809
00:52:27,315 --> 00:52:30,341
tore my heart out, man, for reals, yo.

810
00:52:30,452 --> 00:52:33,182
- Oh, Horsedick.
- Dot-MPEG.

811
00:52:33,288 --> 00:52:35,188
Dot-MPEG.

812
00:52:36,891 --> 00:52:40,793
You know, I think
I'm startin' to feel high.

813
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:45,888
I don't even know where I am.

814
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,127
What was we talking about?

815
00:52:48,236 --> 00:52:50,602
#Take that off#

816
00:52:50,705 --> 00:52:54,232
- You like this?
- Uh- Uh-huh.

817
00:52:58,513 --> 00:53:00,447
You want this?

818
00:53:00,548 --> 00:53:03,039
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

819
00:53:03,151 --> 00:53:07,053
Then come and get it.

820
00:53:07,155 --> 00:53:10,318
# You comin'one more time #

821
00:53:12,861 --> 00:53:16,228
Goddamn. Hey, Charlie.
Control this motherfuckin'bus.

822
00:53:19,934 --> 00:53:21,959
Crazy-ass bus driver.

823
00:53:23,204 --> 00:53:27,106
#Girl, you gotta bounce that #

824
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:29,199
#So now you can know my name #

825
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:32,302
#Know that I'm a better man #

826
00:53:32,413 --> 00:53:34,779
#So now you can know my name #

827
00:53:34,883 --> 00:53:38,182
#Girl, you gotta bounce that #

828
00:53:38,286 --> 00:53:42,086
#Nonstop to the break of dawn ##

829
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:44,522
She said the most...

830
00:53:46,961 --> 00:53:49,657
mean, hurtful things...

831
00:53:49,764 --> 00:53:51,664
to people...

832
00:53:53,234 --> 00:53:55,634
and they laughed at me.

833
00:53:55,737 --> 00:53:57,967
And it was-

834
00:53:58,072 --> 00:54:01,166
So thas why, you know, I'm a dog now.

835
00:54:01,276 --> 00:54:03,005
Cut through bitches like water.

836
00:54:03,111 --> 00:54:06,103
No emotional attachment.
Ain't that right, Tuck?

837
00:54:06,214 --> 00:54:08,876
- Huh? What?
- How was it back there, man?

838
00:54:08,983 --> 00:54:12,578
Good. Real- Really good.

839
00:54:13,888 --> 00:54:17,221
- I gotta go to bed.
- Ha! Ha-ha-ha!

840
00:54:17,325 --> 00:54:20,055
He's tired! Thas what I'm talkin' about!

841
00:54:29,085 --> 00:54:31,986
When you give something to a bitch...

842
00:54:32,088 --> 00:54:34,056
they don't do nothin' but take.

843
00:54:35,391 --> 00:54:38,622
Thas why I don't give 'em
nothin'but the dick.

844
00:54:40,529 --> 00:54:42,963
'Cause they can't take that away.

845
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:48,068
You'll see tomorrow at the mansion.

846
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:52,504
We'll run a train on, like,
seven, eight, nine, 11 of them honeys!

847
00:54:52,608 --> 00:54:54,576
Ain't a Playmate there I ain't tagged yet.

848
00:54:54,677 --> 00:54:56,838
Wait a minute. What?

849
00:54:56,946 --> 00:54:58,937
All of them, dog.

850
00:54:59,048 --> 00:55:01,915
Okay. Horsedick,
you couldn't have "hit" all of them.

851
00:55:02,017 --> 00:55:05,418
- I mean, thas crazy.
- Miss January on my dick.

852
00:55:05,521 --> 00:55:08,081
Miss February on my dick.

853
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:10,590
- Miss March?
- On my dick, dog!

854
00:55:10,693 --> 00:55:12,661
Cindi Whitehall.
Have you had sex with her?

855
00:55:12,762 --> 00:55:15,754
Man, I had that bitch
screamin' like her house was on fire.

856
00:55:15,865 --> 00:55:18,857
She was chompin' down on my dick
like it was a hot-dog eating contest...

857
00:55:18,968 --> 00:55:20,936
and she was some little Asian dude.

858
00:55:29,378 --> 00:55:31,278
What the fuck?

859
00:55:38,354 --> 00:55:40,788
Get the fuck back here, you pervert!

860
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:43,358
I hope you get V.D.
And your dick falls off!

861
00:55:43,459 --> 00:55:46,917
Cindi would never sleep with you!

862
00:55:48,497 --> 00:55:51,193
Oh, fuck.

863
00:55:52,334 --> 00:55:54,234
You all right, man?

864
00:55:54,336 --> 00:55:56,463
She slept with him.

865
00:55:56,572 --> 00:56:00,099
She slept with a shallow,
ignorant asshole like that!

866
00:56:03,779 --> 00:56:05,747
How could she do that?

867
00:56:07,449 --> 00:56:11,180
I don't even know what I'm doing out here,
Tucker. She's gone!

868
00:56:11,287 --> 00:56:16,020
She's not gone, man.
She just had sex with a guy.

869
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:18,093
She's still Cindi.

870
00:56:18,194 --> 00:56:20,662
But we had something special.

871
00:56:23,499 --> 00:56:25,490
You wouldn't understand, Tucker.

872
00:56:25,601 --> 00:56:27,569
Come on, man.

873
00:56:28,838 --> 00:56:31,033
We got a long way to walk.

874
00:56:39,582 --> 00:56:42,415
Man, I wish Candace were here.

875
00:56:42,518 --> 00:56:45,385
Really? Again?

876
00:56:45,487 --> 00:56:47,455
She's trying to kill you.

877
00:56:47,556 --> 00:56:51,014
Yeah. She has a car though.

878
00:56:51,126 --> 00:56:53,720
We have 12 hours
to get across two states.

879
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:58,989
Hey!

880
00:56:59,101 --> 00:57:01,365
People are assholes.

881
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:05,065
Someone will stop.
Don't worry, dude. Things work out.

882
00:57:05,174 --> 00:57:07,642
No, they don't. Things do not work out.

883
00:57:07,743 --> 00:57:11,702
I am living proof of that.

884
00:57:11,814 --> 00:57:16,080
Are you boys looking for a ride?

885
00:57:16,185 --> 00:57:20,884
Here is the deal.
I am Katja. This is my girlfriend, Vonka.

886
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:23,550
Your... girlfriend?

887
00:57:23,659 --> 00:57:26,992
Yes. We're lesbians. Does that bother you?

888
00:57:28,163 --> 00:57:29,630
No. No. No.

889
00:57:29,732 --> 00:57:33,168
We're driving to Los Angeles,
but we are just so madly in love...

890
00:57:33,269 --> 00:57:35,737
that we can't keep our hands
off each other.

891
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:38,636
We have to make out
and make love all the time.

892
00:57:38,741 --> 00:57:41,107
- Oh.
- Oh.

893
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:43,804
So we need you boys
to drive the car to Los Angeles...

894
00:57:43,913 --> 00:57:45,904
so we can get crazy in the backseat...

895
00:57:46,015 --> 00:57:49,917
and make love and suck
and fuck each other the whole way.

896
00:57:50,019 --> 00:57:51,953
Can you boys do that?

897
00:57:53,923 --> 00:57:57,154
Yeah. Yeah. We-We can do that.

898
00:58:10,906 --> 00:58:13,534
Katja.

899
00:58:13,642 --> 00:58:17,009
Oh. Right there. Katja!

900
00:58:32,795 --> 00:58:36,663
Whoa! Aah!

901
00:58:40,435 --> 00:58:45,304
- Is there going to be a problem?
- No. No.

902
00:58:45,406 --> 00:58:48,534
You almost make me bite Vonka's labia.

903
00:58:48,643 --> 00:58:50,611
Oh, sweet God.

904
00:59:14,102 --> 00:59:17,094
Thirty miles to Los Angeles.
We're almost there.

905
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:25,546
Is this going to happen
every five minutes?

906
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:28,444
No. No. I got it. I got it.

907
00:59:30,485 --> 00:59:33,648
No.

908
00:59:33,755 --> 00:59:35,985
Ain't seen shit in here.

909
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:41,853
Speak.

910
00:59:41,963 --> 00:59:44,989
One of our trucks saw them
heading into Los Angeles.

911
00:59:45,099 --> 00:59:47,932
Los Angeles. Of course.

912
00:59:48,035 --> 00:59:50,526
Yeah, but the trail goes cold after that.

913
00:59:50,638 --> 00:59:52,606
No, it doesn't.

914
00:59:52,707 --> 00:59:56,609
You tell your men I know
exactly where he's going.

915
01:00:06,788 --> 01:00:09,951
Look, lesbians! Palm trees.

916
01:00:10,057 --> 01:00:13,493
You know, lesbians,
I didn't want to say anything before...

917
01:00:13,594 --> 01:00:16,586
but the car is really starting to smell.

918
01:00:17,598 --> 01:00:21,125
So we have an hour till this thing starts.
You know where the mansion is?

919
01:00:21,235 --> 01:00:26,298
10228 Charring Cross Road,
Los Angeles, California, 90024.

920
01:00:27,542 --> 01:00:29,510
Whas up, boys and girls?
I'm Carrie Keagan...

921
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:33,137
and we're at Playboy's
annual anniversary bash.

922
01:00:34,816 --> 01:00:38,343
I heard Horsedick. MPEG
is actually in the mansion right now.

923
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:43,850
Wow. I can't believe we made it.

924
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:46,688
My God. We're 20 minutes late.
They've already started the party.

925
01:00:48,663 --> 01:00:50,654
Look. I think right there
is where you sign in.

926
01:00:52,366 --> 01:00:54,357
Oh, no. You have to be on that list.

927
01:00:54,469 --> 01:00:58,098
Oh, man. We are way out of our league.
How the hell are we gonna get in here?

928
01:00:58,206 --> 01:01:00,800
We need some sort of angle.

929
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:05,208
Oh, God!

930
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:14,846
Hey there, everybody.
We are here to party.

931
01:01:14,956 --> 01:01:19,256
- Just here with our dates now.
- Yeah. Not bad, huh?

932
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,386
Pretty good. Hey, those
are our dates. Hey, lesbians!

933
01:01:22,497 --> 01:01:25,728
- Those are our-
- Ow!

934
01:01:25,833 --> 01:01:28,700
- Whoo!
- Wow. Ow! Ow!

935
01:01:28,803 --> 01:01:32,330
That didn't work. Now what do we do?

936
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,465
Firemen!

937
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,610
Is a trap.

938
01:01:41,816 --> 01:01:44,512
Wait a minute. What the hell's going on?
There's no fire here.

939
01:01:44,619 --> 01:01:47,918
Sure there is. All right, men.
Keep your eyes peeled.

940
01:01:48,022 --> 01:01:50,149
He's around here somewhere.

941
01:01:53,027 --> 01:01:56,258
Cover the rear, gentlemen. Come on.
Les move. Les move, les move.

942
01:01:56,364 --> 01:01:58,559
Go on, move, move!

943
01:01:58,666 --> 01:02:00,793
Eugene.

944
01:02:00,902 --> 01:02:03,700
- I think I have a plan.
- What?

945
01:02:03,804 --> 01:02:06,466
- Follow me.
- No, Tucker. Wait!

946
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:10,209
I'm afraid.

947
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:13,479
Sorry about this, fellas.

948
01:02:13,581 --> 01:02:16,641
We're just dumb firemen
trying to do our jobs.

949
01:02:23,391 --> 01:02:26,292
#Come and get me to it #

950
01:02:28,129 --> 01:02:31,121
- # Show me how to do this #
- # Love my body Touch my body #

951
01:02:31,232 --> 01:02:33,427
#Get your body movin'#

952
01:02:35,536 --> 01:02:38,994
- # You like how I do it #
- # Kiss my body, kiss my body #

953
01:02:39,106 --> 01:02:41,836
#Just sittin'here watching your curves
thinking it worked #

954
01:02:41,943 --> 01:02:44,468
#Thinking my vision's blurred ##

955
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:49,539
All right, boys! Keep your eyes peeled
for that son of a bitch Tucker Cleigh!

956
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:52,118
We have word he's at this party!

957
01:02:58,626 --> 01:03:01,561
Uh-uh. You gotta go to
the back of the line, lady.

958
01:03:01,662 --> 01:03:05,996
Yeah, have fun at the party. Let her in! Let her in.

959
01:03:07,969 --> 01:03:10,904
Damn. Bitch is crazy.

960
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,375
Okay. First things first.

961
01:03:15,476 --> 01:03:17,808
Gotta get rid of these outfits
and get poolside.

962
01:03:17,912 --> 01:03:20,904
What? Tucker, you can't ditch your outfit.
What if the firemen see you?

963
01:03:21,015 --> 01:03:24,974
I can't work like this. Firemen
never get laid. Everyone knows that.

964
01:03:25,086 --> 01:03:28,578
- People hate firemen.
- What are you gonna do?

965
01:03:28,689 --> 01:03:31,556
I'm gonna go mingle.
There's three girls for every guy at this party.

966
01:03:31,659 --> 01:03:34,856
Okay. Fine. Do me a favor and keep
your eyes peeled for Cindi, all right?

967
01:03:34,962 --> 01:03:37,362
Okay. Good luck.

968
01:03:45,606 --> 01:03:48,336
Hey, ladies.

969
01:03:48,442 --> 01:03:51,275
I'm from South Carolina.

970
01:04:01,555 --> 01:04:05,355
Hey, gorgeous.
So-What are your hobbies?

971
01:04:05,459 --> 01:04:07,723
- My hobbies?
- Yeah. You know-

972
01:04:07,828 --> 01:04:09,955
What are your turn-ons?

973
01:04:10,064 --> 01:04:11,861
Shit. Where's my pepper spray?

974
01:04:15,469 --> 01:04:17,369
Ugh.

975
01:04:25,546 --> 01:04:27,514
Hey, girl of my dreams.

976
01:04:27,615 --> 01:04:29,583
Ugh!

977
01:04:32,486 --> 01:04:36,388
Hey! All right. MI LF.

978
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:39,118
- I'm 25.
- Really?

979
01:04:39,226 --> 01:04:41,524
Fuck off.

980
01:04:50,504 --> 01:04:53,598
Sara Jean Underwood...

981
01:04:53,708 --> 01:04:55,938
Playmate of the Year, 2007?

982
01:04:56,043 --> 01:05:00,275
- Thas me.
- Oh, my God! Is such an honor to meet you!

983
01:05:00,381 --> 01:05:02,611
- Aw. Why, thank you.
- I'm Tucker Cleigh.

984
01:05:02,717 --> 01:05:04,617
And who is this little guy?

985
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:08,655
Oh, this is Puddles, and he's a rescue.
I got him from the pound last week.

986
01:05:08,756 --> 01:05:10,519
Oh, no way.
I call the pound all the time.

987
01:05:10,624 --> 01:05:13,252
- You do?
- Yeah. Last week even.

988
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:16,124
Some loser lost his jerk Labrador...

989
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:18,357
'cause I caught him going
through my trash looking for food.

990
01:05:18,466 --> 01:05:22,197
And you sent this
"jerk Labrador" to the pound?

991
01:05:22,303 --> 01:05:24,362
- Big time.
- Thas horrible.

992
01:05:24,472 --> 01:05:27,464
No. I know. I mean, what? Why?

993
01:05:27,575 --> 01:05:30,203
Because they put dogs
to sleep at the pound.

994
01:05:30,311 --> 01:05:34,213
They were gonna put Puddles here down
'cause he was sick and nobody would adopt him.

995
01:05:34,315 --> 01:05:37,182
So I took him home with me and I've
slowly been nursing him back to health.

996
01:05:37,284 --> 01:05:39,980
Whoa. Thas so weird.

997
01:05:40,087 --> 01:05:42,282
It is?

998
01:05:42,389 --> 01:05:45,153
I mean, I just- I didn't realize
that human beings...

999
01:05:45,259 --> 01:05:47,159
could nurse dogs.

1000
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:51,821
I'm not literally nursing him.

1001
01:05:51,932 --> 01:05:54,958
Oh! I thought you meant with your-

1002
01:05:55,069 --> 01:05:59,802
I'm sorry. I was-
I was thinking about... your boobs.

1003
01:05:59,907 --> 01:06:04,276
- I mean, because that sort of
stuff does happen nowadays...

1004
01:06:04,378 --> 01:06:06,312
especially with modern times.

1005
01:06:06,413 --> 01:06:09,576
And I've seen that
on the Internet a bunch.

1006
01:06:09,683 --> 01:06:11,776
You've seen a lot of that
on the Internet?

1007
01:06:11,886 --> 01:06:13,877
Yeah, I mean-

1008
01:06:13,988 --> 01:06:18,857
Some girls will even have s-
make love to dogs on the Internet.

1009
01:06:18,959 --> 01:06:22,486
Not that thas good at all,
'cause thas bad-

1010
01:06:22,596 --> 01:06:26,430
Unless you do that, and then,
whatever. I'm not judging.

1011
01:06:26,534 --> 01:06:29,697
I'm sorry, Tucker.
Who is it that you're here with again?

1012
01:06:29,804 --> 01:06:32,932
I-I'm sorry. I have such
a problem with rambling...

1013
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,600
especially when I'm
meeting people like you.

1014
01:06:35,709 --> 01:06:38,735
I'm always blowing first impressions.

1015
01:06:38,846 --> 01:06:41,212
Can we just start over?
Give me another chance.

1016
01:06:41,315 --> 01:06:43,215
Can I get you a drink or anything?

1017
01:06:43,317 --> 01:06:45,911
Thas sweet, Tucker, but I actually
have to take Puddles out to the lawn.

1018
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:48,784
- He has to go to the bathroom pretty badly.
- I'll take him to the bathroom!

1019
01:06:48,889 --> 01:06:50,652
No, thas really not necessary.

1020
01:06:50,758 --> 01:06:52,726
I insist. Is the least I can do.

1021
01:06:52,827 --> 01:06:56,058
- Please?
- Okay.

1022
01:06:56,163 --> 01:06:58,393
Okay, Tucker. You win.

1023
01:06:58,499 --> 01:07:01,832
You won't regret this,
Playmate of the Year, 2007!

1024
01:07:01,936 --> 01:07:03,904
Bring him right back!

1025
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:11,669
Oh, my God.
That is the cutest little dog I've ever seen.

1026
01:07:11,779 --> 01:07:13,644
- Is it yours?
- Um-

1027
01:07:13,747 --> 01:07:16,045
- What is his name?
- I think is, uh-

1028
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:19,142
Oh, my God! Look at his little feet!

1029
01:07:19,253 --> 01:07:21,153
I love men with dogs.

1030
01:07:21,255 --> 01:07:22,847
- Really?
- Yeah.

1031
01:07:22,957 --> 01:07:25,585
My last boyfriend hated dogs.
Such an asshole!

1032
01:07:25,693 --> 01:07:28,491
I mean, what kind of psycho doesn't like dogs?

1033
01:07:28,596 --> 01:07:31,030
And thas just when I knew
that he was not for me.

1034
01:07:31,131 --> 01:07:33,565
I mean, look at his little paws!

1035
01:07:33,667 --> 01:07:36,932
- Yeah, they're pretty small.
- I know, right?

1036
01:07:37,037 --> 01:07:39,528
Oh. Oh, uh-

1037
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,905
Mmm. What?

1038
01:07:44,245 --> 01:07:48,511
- Nothing.
- I just want to talk to you all night.

1039
01:07:48,616 --> 01:07:51,449
Can you get me, like, another drink?

1040
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:55,917
Wow! You're good!

1041
01:07:59,059 --> 01:08:00,959
This tastes like shit!

1042
01:08:01,061 --> 01:08:03,461
I mean, the other one
tasted different, you know.

1043
01:08:03,564 --> 01:08:07,022
- It tasted like- I don't know-
- Pee?

1044
01:08:07,134 --> 01:08:10,297
No! You're funny.

1045
01:08:10,404 --> 01:08:14,238
Okay. Here's the plan.
I'm gonna go use the little girls'room.

1046
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:16,707
You're gonna go find me
some more of the good stuff.

1047
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:19,904
And then we're gonna rendezvous
back here in, like, five minutes, okay?

1048
01:08:20,014 --> 01:08:22,574
And make sure you bring him!

1049
01:08:22,683 --> 01:08:25,049
Okay. Bye.

1050
01:08:32,092 --> 01:08:33,992
...cute T-shirt.

1051
01:08:34,094 --> 01:08:36,062
I'm, like, thas cool.
Whatever. Make a wish.

1052
01:08:36,163 --> 01:08:39,257
Then this little motherfucker...

1053
01:08:39,366 --> 01:08:42,733
hits me... and poops all over my bus.

1054
01:08:42,836 --> 01:08:44,497
Man, I hate poop.

1055
01:08:44,605 --> 01:08:47,665
I'm hopin' those little shits
do make it over here.

1056
01:08:47,775 --> 01:08:51,643
Gonna kill that little bitch.
He's gonna suck my dick.

1057
01:08:51,745 --> 01:08:54,646
I'm-a just gonna hold
his little dead head right there.

1058
01:08:54,748 --> 01:08:56,648
Thas whas up, man.

1059
01:08:57,885 --> 01:08:59,978
Thas whas up.

1060
01:09:03,524 --> 01:09:06,823
Come on, Puddles. Come on.
Come on, Puddles. Come on.

1061
01:09:06,927 --> 01:09:09,555
Whas the matter? Here we go. Here we go.

1062
01:09:09,663 --> 01:09:12,257
Here we go. Here we go. Put it over that and go.

1063
01:09:12,366 --> 01:09:14,493
Puddles, go to the bathroom.

1064
01:09:14,601 --> 01:09:17,069
Whas the matter?

1065
01:09:17,171 --> 01:09:19,162
Maybe you're empty.

1066
01:09:19,273 --> 01:09:23,107
Um- No. Here we go. A little beer?

1067
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:25,508
Little beer. Little bit of beer.

1068
01:09:25,612 --> 01:09:29,104
- Little bit of-
- Oh, my God!

1069
01:09:29,216 --> 01:09:32,652
Oh, my God. Puddles.

1070
01:09:34,722 --> 01:09:36,849
What the shit?

1071
01:09:36,957 --> 01:09:39,926
- Oh! Sorry.
- Hi. May I help you?

1072
01:09:40,027 --> 01:09:42,154
Um, no. No, thank you.

1073
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:46,130
Actually, yeah. Have you seen
Cindi Whitehall around here?

1074
01:09:46,233 --> 01:09:49,031
Oh, my God. Are you a stalker?

1075
01:09:49,136 --> 01:09:51,900
- We have a 2-14!
- What? I'm not a stalker.

1076
01:09:52,006 --> 01:09:54,873
Oh, good. What are you drinkin'?

1077
01:09:54,975 --> 01:09:57,307
Nothing. Never mind.

1078
01:09:58,612 --> 01:10:01,581
So we're goin'at it
there in the driveway, and she's, like...

1079
01:10:01,682 --> 01:10:06,244
"Oh, my God, this is the best
sex I have ever had."

1080
01:10:06,353 --> 01:10:10,722
And I'm, like,
"Everyone keeps telling me that."

1081
01:10:12,126 --> 01:10:14,026
Isn't that weird?

1082
01:10:14,128 --> 01:10:16,028
Isn't-

1083
01:10:40,854 --> 01:10:43,288
The Grotto.

1084
01:10:47,227 --> 01:10:49,195
Um, excuse me, sir.
I'm looking for Cindi Whitehall.

1085
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:55,148
- What you want with Cindi Whitehall?
- Oh, I'm her boyfriend.

1086
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:58,515
- Or I was her boyfriend,
but then we got separated.
- We got a 2-14.

1087
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:00,884
No, no, no. I'm not a stalker.
Ow! I'm not a stalker!

1088
01:11:00,989 --> 01:11:03,389
I came across the country
just to see her!

1089
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:05,153
Hey, l-

1090
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:15,836
Cindi. Cindi!

1091
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,904
No, Cindi! I'm her boyfriend
from high school!

1092
01:11:20,008 --> 01:11:23,136
- Eugene?
- We were sweethearts in high school!

1093
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:26,339
- Cindi.
- Eugene?

1094
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:29,713
Oh. Candace.

1095
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:31,786
Good to see you.

1096
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:34,321
I was worried sick.

1097
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:37,551
Uh, how are you?

1098
01:11:37,659 --> 01:11:39,854
Your face looks-

1099
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:44,897
Comin' along.

1100
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,026
By the way, sorry about that.

1101
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:51,072
Did I ever tell you that,
'cause I'm not sure-

1102
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:55,371
- You get back here, Tucker Cleigh!
- There he is! Everybody move!

1103
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:58,002
Ow! Let me go! Ow!

1104
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:00,741
- Ow!
- You're gonna sit your ass here
till the police show up!

1105
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:04,842
I need to talk to Cindi!
I'm not a stalker! I know her!

1106
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:09,824
Quick! To the second floor!

1107
01:12:09,925 --> 01:12:11,893
Fan out.

1108
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:19,699
- Check on this floor.
- Yes, sir.

1109
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,468
Come on, boys. He went that way.

1110
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:30,242
Lesbians! Help me break this door down.

1111
01:12:30,345 --> 01:12:32,245
Where are the bedrooms?

1112
01:12:32,347 --> 01:12:35,976
Vonka and I thought of a new position,
and we need a bed against a wall.

1113
01:12:36,084 --> 01:12:38,416
There's bedrooms through this door!
And Jacuzzis too.

1114
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,114
- There are?
- Jacuzzis?

1115
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:45,284
- Yeah. But is locked. You gotta help me.
- Step aside.

1116
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:13,948
- Okay. Come on. Go, go, go, go, go!
- There he is. Get him.

1117
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:22,190
Good idea, lesbians!

1118
01:13:22,297 --> 01:13:25,266
Lesbians! Lesbians!

1119
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:41,279
What seems to be the problem, son?

1120
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:43,851
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1121
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:47,012
I can't look. I can't look.
I can't look, I can't look.

1122
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:51,024
- Oh! Oh! I can't- Oh, my God!
- Relax, son. Whas your name?

1123
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:54,095
Oh! Tucker Cleigh, sir.

1124
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:56,824
And I am your biggest fan.

1125
01:13:56,932 --> 01:14:01,369
I try to apply your methods and principles
to every aspect of my life.

1126
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:04,303
Oh, yeah? How's that workin'out for you?

1127
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:08,502
- Good. Great. Awesome.
- Well, thas great.

1128
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:12,068
The party's outside. Have a good time.

1129
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:19,717
Something wrong?

1130
01:14:22,557 --> 01:14:26,118
Well, yeah, actually.

1131
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:32,366
Things haven't been going
so great for me lately.

1132
01:14:32,467 --> 01:14:35,868
I mean, I'm here at the Playboy Mansion...

1133
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:40,431
and-
I'm still striking out.

1134
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:42,442
I don't get it.

1135
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,046
Have a seat, son.

1136
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:51,785
Eugene?

1137
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:53,548
Cindi.

1138
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:56,180
Oh, my God! I can't believe this!

1139
01:14:56,291 --> 01:15:00,387
- When did you wake up?
- About three days ago.

1140
01:15:00,495 --> 01:15:04,261
- How did you find me?
- It wasn't too hard.

1141
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:07,426
- What does that mean?
- Where have you been?

1142
01:15:07,536 --> 01:15:09,436
What?

1143
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:12,803
- Where have you been?
- I've been a couple of places.

1144
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:14,808
- Been working.
- Working?

1145
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:18,038
Working as what? A whore?

1146
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:21,379
- Stop that! I know him.
- Ow!

1147
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:26,113
Sorry, miss. It just really sticks in my craw
when people disrespect women.

1148
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:28,086
What?

1149
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:31,057
Eugene, how could you say
something like that?

1150
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:32,990
- You left me!
- Eugene, l-

1151
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:35,655
You left me in a hospital bed
when I needed you the most.

1152
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:37,959
Eugene, you were in a coma for four years.

1153
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:41,866
Yeah! I was in a coma, and you've been
running around doing God knows what.

1154
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:44,734
- What are you talking about?
- You're doing pornography.

1155
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,638
You're posing naked for everyone to see.

1156
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:50,974
- Eugene.
- How many guys have you slept with, Cindi?

1157
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:53,377
100? 200?

1158
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:58,251
Ow! Ah.

1159
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:02,653
Just imagine how you would feel, Cindi...

1160
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:05,192
if you woke up one morning...

1161
01:16:05,293 --> 01:16:08,421
and everyone that you loved
had left you...

1162
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,259
and your dad had bailed on you...

1163
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:13,994
and the one person that you thought
would always be there for you...

1164
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:16,627
is out flashing her tits to the world...

1165
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:20,299
and blowing everyone she meets. Ow!

1166
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:22,340
So, you-you have a girlfriend.

1167
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:26,744
Yeah, and she's great.
She's the coolest chick I've ever met.

1168
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:29,544
Most girls want to kill me
after two or three nights...

1169
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,983
and it took her 13 whole months.

1170
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:34,885
Then whas the problem?
Sounds like you found a great girl.

1171
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:37,618
She is great. Is just-

1172
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:41,787
I can't get settled down yet.
I have to hit a respectable quota.

1173
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:45,856
Tucker, is the quality,
not the quantity...

1174
01:16:45,967 --> 01:16:48,800
of the relationships that counts.

1175
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:51,896
But you're dating seven women at once.

1176
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,879
Here. Look at this.

1177
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:02,073
Oh! Gross!

1178
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:05,347
- Thas Gertrude VonBrauer.
- Whas wrong with her eye?

1179
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:07,251
- Is dead.
- Aah!

1180
01:17:07,355 --> 01:17:09,983
Gertrude was my next door neighbor.

1181
01:17:10,092 --> 01:17:13,926
Our childhood friendship
blossomed into a romance by high school.

1182
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:15,656
Hef, no!

1183
01:17:15,764 --> 01:17:17,664
Tucker, yes.

1184
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:20,826
Gertrude VonBrauer
was the love of my life.

1185
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:23,632
But she's, like...

1186
01:17:23,738 --> 01:17:27,765
the worst-looking person I have ever seen.

1187
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:30,106
Give me back that photograph.

1188
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:39,018
Gertrude died when she was 18 years old.

1189
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:41,282
Oh, thank God.

1190
01:17:43,391 --> 01:17:45,450
Tucker, the point I'm trying to make...

1191
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,154
is that when you find
that special someone in your life...

1192
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:50,197
you have to hold on to them.

1193
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:53,893
Now, I've known
quite a few women in my life...

1194
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:56,937
and I've had a phenomenal sex life.

1195
01:17:57,038 --> 01:18:00,166
But I'd trade it all in
for just one more afternoon...

1196
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:03,802
with this young 18-year-old girl
from Milford, Kentucky.

1197
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:05,777
Who's busted.

1198
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:09,339
Tucker, there's a bunny...

1199
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:12,249
deep down inside each and every woman.

1200
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:17,256
They're just not bunnies
you'd put in your magazine.

1201
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:19,259
No, they're not.

1202
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:22,159
But if you can see
the bunny in those girls...

1203
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:25,028
then you're on to something, my friend.

1204
01:18:26,701 --> 01:18:28,726
I think I get it.

1205
01:18:28,837 --> 01:18:33,797
I was trying to turn my girlfriend
into a Playboy bunny...

1206
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:35,877
and thas why she had that seizure...

1207
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:38,502
and I stabbed her in the face a bunch.

1208
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:41,741
But if I just realized she was a bunny...

1209
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:45,445
then none of these firemen
would be trying to kill me.

1210
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:50,015
I gotta be honest with you.
I'm gonna call Security.

1211
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:52,355
Okay, Mr. Hefner. Thanks for the talk.

1212
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:55,588
No problem, son.

1213
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:58,492
Look, I've said what I have to say.

1214
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,898
There's nothing else to do.

1215
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:04,631
Things will never be the same because I
am always gonna think...

1216
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:08,368
about you with those guys.

1217
01:19:08,476 --> 01:19:11,934
I don't even know why I came here.

1218
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:14,481
Closure, I think.

1219
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:19,520
Eugene, everything I've done since
you fell down the stairs has been for you.

1220
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:22,886
Oh, yeah, right. Posing naked in Playboy
is really helping me out a lot.

1221
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:24,891
Thanks for that.

1222
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:27,359
Eugene, where do you think
the money came from?

1223
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:30,056
- What money?
- The money for your hospital care.

1224
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,368
Your dad didn't think
that you would ever wake up...

1225
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:38,462
and he was gonna have you
moved to a class "D" hospice where they-

1226
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:41,041
where they basically
just store you till you die.

1227
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:44,507
I sent whatever money I could...

1228
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,581
from part-time waitressing
during college...

1229
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:48,706
but it never really amounted to much.

1230
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:51,650
Then I started making
some real money modeling...

1231
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:53,880
and had you moved
to a better treatment center.

1232
01:19:56,524 --> 01:19:59,425
Tucker never told you any of this?

1233
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:05,666
No. He never did.

1234
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:09,501
Okay. Hef s orders:
All stalkers out of the mansion.

1235
01:20:11,172 --> 01:20:14,039
Let me go!

1236
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:16,042
Ow!

1237
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:18,044
- Eugene!
- Tucker!

1238
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:21,013
I met Hef. He talked to me.
I think I had a breakthrough.

1239
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:24,415
- How could you, you son of a bitch?
- What are you talking about?

1240
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:27,181
You fucking brought me all the way
out here to your stupid party...

1241
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:29,382
- when you knew Cindi never left me.
- Eugene!

1242
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:31,891
Wait. She was at the hospital
the whole time?

1243
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:35,429
Don't play dumb with me!
She was paying for my medical bills.

1244
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:37,521
How could you not know that?

1245
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:40,965
Mister's girlfriend not pay all this money
for you to use this as a porno room.

1246
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:44,197
Juanita, I don't speak Spanish.
Ándale! Ándale!

1247
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:46,831
The mister's girlfriend is on the phone.
You want to talk to her?

1248
01:20:46,941 --> 01:20:48,465
Go away, Juanita.

1249
01:20:48,576 --> 01:20:50,703
What an angel that young
Cindi Whitehall is...

1250
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:52,780
for paying all this man's medical bills.

1251
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:56,408
- I've never seen more devotion
in all my years of medicine.
- Go!

1252
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:59,180
Juanita, I'm trying to do something.
Do you comprende?

1253
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:00,811
No!

1254
01:21:00,922 --> 01:21:03,152
You let me think Cindi had abandoned me!

1255
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:06,716
But wait a minute. If Cindi was paying
your hospital bills this whole time...

1256
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:08,762
then she obviously still loves you.

1257
01:21:08,863 --> 01:21:09,921
- You should be excited.
- Tucker Cleigh!

1258
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:13,125
Candace!

1259
01:21:13,234 --> 01:21:16,397
And Candace's brother, Rick!

1260
01:21:16,504 --> 01:21:18,836
Put him down!

1261
01:21:21,843 --> 01:21:25,040
You are gonna die
for what you did to my sister.

1262
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:27,944
- Yeah!
- Make it slow, Rick.

1263
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:29,607
L-

1264
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:33,449
There goes that
sissy-hitting motherfucker!

1265
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:36,956
- Eugene. So we meet again, huh?
- Horsedick.

1266
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:40,027
- Dot-MPEG! Dot-MPEG!
- Dot-MPEG.

1267
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:43,757
I was just telling my friends here,
if I ever saw your pretty little face again...

1268
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:46,095
I was gonna rip it off and fuck it.

1269
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:48,692
- No.
- And I don't lie to my friends.

1270
01:21:48,803 --> 01:21:52,102
All right, men.
Les do this fireman-style.

1271
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:54,903
Yeah!

1272
01:21:57,645 --> 01:22:01,775
I shall now bathe my steel
in the blood of the offender.

1273
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:04,716
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

1274
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:09,017
Before you kill me,
let me just say one thing.

1275
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:14,426
Candace, I know you're mad, and you have
every right to do whatever you want to me.

1276
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:17,396
But I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

1277
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:20,366
See, I was just hangin'out with Hef...

1278
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:22,993
and I realized something-

1279
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:26,835
You're my busted girl from Kentucky.

1280
01:22:26,941 --> 01:22:30,570
We both hate the same music
and like getting wasted and stuff.

1281
01:22:30,678 --> 01:22:33,374
And you like me despite all my faults.

1282
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:36,348
So the least I can do is look past yours.

1283
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:42,086
- My faults?
- Yeah. Candace, your face is a wreck.

1284
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:45,489
- You stabbed me!
- Thas one of my faults.

1285
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:48,153
And you have this really stupid
hatred of strobe lights.

1286
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:52,563
When you have epilepsy,
strobe lights trigger seizures.

1287
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:54,999
See? Thas stupid.

1288
01:22:55,103 --> 01:22:57,003
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

1289
01:22:57,105 --> 01:22:59,938
The point I'm trying to make
is that none of that matters.

1290
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:02,407
I like you anyway.

1291
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:05,445
Look, I always hoped
when I met someone like you...

1292
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:08,948
I'd already have this crazy,
impressive sexual history.

1293
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:11,712
But now I realize that
none of thas important...

1294
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,378
once you find someone that you truly love.

1295
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:15,388
And when I'm with you...

1296
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:19,256
none of the other chicks that I've nailed
in the past matter anyway.

1297
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,385
Candace...

1298
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:25,455
you're the last person
that I ever want to bang.

1299
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:28,593
And if your weird brain thing makes you
bite my junk while you're blowing me...

1300
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:31,866
then so be it.

1301
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:35,067
I'll never stab you again.

1302
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,918
I love you, Tucker Cleigh.

1303
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:50,717
Goddamn it!

1304
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:53,157
I need to talk to Cindi.

1305
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:56,890
Well, that was real sweet.

1306
01:23:56,998 --> 01:24:00,729
How you gonna get out of this, Eugene?
You gonna tell me you love me?

1307
01:24:00,835 --> 01:24:03,804
Horsedick, you gotta let me go.
I need to talk to Cindi.

1308
01:24:03,905 --> 01:24:06,806
Why don't you write
a message for her on my dick...

1309
01:24:06,908 --> 01:24:09,502
and I will make sure she gets it.

1310
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:16,683
You know what, Phil?

1311
01:24:16,784 --> 01:24:19,912
That kind of thing would have bothered me
before- that you had sex with Cindi-

1312
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:23,787
but not now, 'cause I had
a relationship with her.

1313
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:26,690
She's not just some trophy.
She's the total package.

1314
01:24:26,794 --> 01:24:28,955
And a guy like you, Horsedick-

1315
01:24:29,063 --> 01:24:31,497
You wouldn't even know
what to do with a girl like that.

1316
01:24:31,599 --> 01:24:34,124
- I'll say he wouldn't.
- Cindi.

1317
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:37,864
Cindi! Wh-Whas up, baby?
How you doin'?

1318
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:40,372
Horsedick wouldn't know what to do
with a blow-up doll.

1319
01:24:40,475 --> 01:24:44,070
- What? What is she talkin' about?
- Nothin'!

1320
01:24:44,178 --> 01:24:46,146
Hey, les go back up
to the mansion, y'all.

1321
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:48,442
There's a D.J. He's supposed
to be cold-blooded. Come on.

1322
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:50,950
Horsedick doesn't have a dick.

1323
01:24:51,052 --> 01:24:53,316
Bitch! You promised.

1324
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:55,981
- What?
- Horsedick wasn't born with genitalia.

1325
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:58,354
He has to pee through a straw.

1326
01:24:58,459 --> 01:25:00,723
This bitch has gone crazy.

1327
01:25:00,828 --> 01:25:03,888
Hey, everybody go
to the Horsedick. MPEG party bus!

1328
01:25:03,998 --> 01:25:06,523
- Come on! Is a party!
- Wait a minute.

1329
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:09,364
- What about all those girls you banged?
- Yeah, dog.

1330
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:12,030
What about all them girls?

1331
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:15,906
You know what? I've never actually seen
Horsedick make it with a ho.

1332
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:17,978
Why you wanna see that?

1333
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:21,981
Never thought I'd say this-
Fuck that! Let me see your penis, dog.

1334
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:24,381
I ain't showin' you shit, man. All y'all-

1335
01:25:24,485 --> 01:25:26,715
What you doin'?

1336
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:37,992
It ain't my fault.
My mama was on acne medication.

1337
01:25:38,099 --> 01:25:40,897
- Oh, man!
- Leave me alone!

1338
01:25:46,107 --> 01:25:48,007
Cindi. Cindi.

1339
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:50,907
Cindi. Listen, I'm sorry.

1340
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:53,776
And what happened in the past is the past.

1341
01:25:53,881 --> 01:25:58,113
Whas important is right now. I wanna-
I wanna start over, if you'll have me.

1342
01:25:58,219 --> 01:26:00,619
- I just think that-
- Aw.

1343
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:05,588
Okay.

1344
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:09,459
Okay. I just have a question. Why didn't
you call me when I woke up in the hospital?

1345
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:13,591
I call the hospital every Monday.
When did you wake up?

1346
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:15,999
On, uh, Wednesday.

1347
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:20,131
- And you just immediately ran off?
- Yeah, I guess.

1348
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:22,072
Tucker's idea.

1349
01:26:22,176 --> 01:26:24,804
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

1350
01:26:24,912 --> 01:26:28,575
We've really gotta
get you some new friends.

1351
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:37,385
No. This one's okay.

1352
01:26:51,773 --> 01:26:53,673
Let 'em in.

1353
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:58,135
Let 'em in, damn it.

1354
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:07,817
- Mmm.
- I'll see you later.

1355
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:09,822
- Okay.
- Bye.

1356
01:27:09,924 --> 01:27:12,392
Bye. Bye.

1357
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:20,490
- So, Candace, huh?
- Yeah. Isn't she the best?

1358
01:27:20,601 --> 01:27:22,694
She's somethin' else, all right.

1359
01:27:22,804 --> 01:27:24,965
So you guys are like-You're good now?

1360
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,200
Yeah. Candace thinks that we
should try to get pregnant.

1361
01:27:27,308 --> 01:27:29,276
You know, really try to work things out.

1362
01:27:29,377 --> 01:27:31,641
Thas a great idea, Tucker.

1363
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:35,147
That is a great idea. How are we gonna fight
if there's always a baby around?

1364
01:27:35,249 --> 01:27:39,481
And I'm gonna see if Hef can hook me up
with an internship at the photo department.

1365
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:41,680
- Hey, thas awesome.
- Yeah.

1366
01:27:41,789 --> 01:27:43,814
So, what about you and Cindi?

1367
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:47,520
I don't know, but, uh,
I feel really good about it.

1368
01:27:47,628 --> 01:27:49,220
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1369
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:51,958
- Cool.
- You wanna know something crazy?

1370
01:27:52,066 --> 01:27:55,832
- You don't have a dick.
- No.

1371
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:58,132
She's upstairs waiting for me right now.

1372
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:00,104
- No!
- Yep.

1373
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:01,835
- No!
- Yep.

1374
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:05,401
Your first time is going to be
with a Playboy Playmate...

1375
01:28:05,513 --> 01:28:07,777
at the Playboy Mansion?

1376
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:09,816
- Yes.
- How do you feel?

1377
01:28:09,917 --> 01:28:14,377
Um, I feel ready. I feel ready.

1378
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:15,979
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1379
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:17,557
A toast.

1380
01:28:17,658 --> 01:28:19,489
- To new beginnings.
- To new beginnings. Well put.

1381
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:24,440
Oh!

1382
01:28:24,542 --> 01:28:26,942
Whoo!

1383
01:28:27,045 --> 01:28:28,979
You're probably gonna wanna
have another one, so you'll last longer.

1384
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:31,548
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1385
01:28:31,650 --> 01:28:34,813
All right, everybody,
I'm goin' upstairs...

1386
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:36,854
to have sex...

1387
01:28:36,955 --> 01:28:39,116
with my girlfriend!

1388
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:44,160
- Is it good?
- Oh, yeah, Eugene.

1389
01:28:44,262 --> 01:28:46,196
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1390
01:28:46,298 --> 01:28:48,732
Thas good, 'cause
I'm tryin' really hard.

1391
01:28:48,833 --> 01:28:50,858
Oh, you're doing
a really good job, Eugene.

1392
01:28:50,969 --> 01:28:52,800
- Does it feel good?
- Mm-hmm.

1393
01:28:52,904 --> 01:28:55,532
- Okay.
- Oh, no.

1394
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,801
Eugene, be careful. Don't overexert yourself.

1395
01:28:58,009 --> 01:29:00,477
#Give me some of your
sweetness, honey #

1396

#Give me some
of that sweet thing now #

1397
01:29:07,352 --> 01:29:09,320
During my time in South Carolina...

1398
01:29:09,421 --> 01:29:12,618
I discovered a groundbreaking
and new experimental way...

1399
01:29:12,724 --> 01:29:15,693
of reinstating consciousness
to the comatose.

1400
01:29:15,794 --> 01:29:18,695
It has proven itself
to be quite effective.

1401
01:29:35,613 --> 01:29:38,912
Blue Team to I.C. U, please.

1402
01:29:39,017 --> 01:29:42,180
I swear I saw this work once.

1403
01:29:56,801 --> 01:29:59,269
You're a dead man, Tucker Cleigh.
