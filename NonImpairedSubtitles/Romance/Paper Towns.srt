1
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,523
QUENTIN: The way I figure it,
everyone gets a miracle.

2
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,964
Like, maybe you hit
the Powerball jackpot.

3
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,363
Or a last-second jumper
in the NBA Finals. (CHUCKLES)

4
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,609
Maybe you make it to outer space...

5
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,967
or marry the Queen of England,
or something.

6
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,611
If you consider all the unlikely things
that happen in all the world...

7
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,090
you gotta think at least one of them
will happen to each of us.

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,843
Turns out, my miracle was different.

9
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,445
Of all the houses

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,001
in all the subdivisions
in all the state of Florida...

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,242
I wound up living across the street...

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,780
from Margo Roth Spiegelman.

13
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,820
Bring your own lampshade,
somewhere there's a party

14
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,100
Here it's never endin',
can't remember when it started

15
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,820
Pass around the lampshade,

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,780
There'll be plenty enough room in jail

17
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,205
QUENTIN: From the moment I saw her
I was hopelessly, madly in love.

18
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,060
If bein' wrong's a crime,
I'm serving forever

19
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,900
If bein' strong's your kind

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,527
Then I need help here with this feather

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,140
QUENTIN: Due to our close proximity

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,924
in both age and location...

23
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,248
and for no other reason
I could ever discern...

24
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,540
we soon became friends.

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,168
If bein' afraid is a crime
we hang side by side

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,089
At the swingin' party down the line

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,326
Look.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,525
Quentin.

29
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,445
He's dead.

30
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,482
We should get out of here, Margo.

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,160
I thought you closed
your eyes when you died.

32
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,401
QUENTIN: The truth is...

33
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,500
at the time, it didn't feel like

34
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,806
that big a deal to me.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,287
It's not like I knew the guy.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,420
If I had a panic attack

37
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,443
every time someone I didn't know died...

38
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,220
I'd go insane.

39
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,731
(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)

40
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,243
It was a much bigger deal to Margo.

41
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,881
I figured it out.

42
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,886
His name is Robert Joyner.

43
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,041
He was 36.

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,407
Apparently he was getting divorced
and he was sad about it.

45
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,971
How do you know all this?

46
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,521
I'm doing an investigation. Are you in?

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,241
Sure.

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,562
- Great. Come on.
- Wait, what?

49
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,881
His wife works at SeaWorld.

50
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,724
I bet there's a clue.

51
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,041
Margo...

52
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,804
we can't go to SeaWorld.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,047
It's almost 11:00.

54
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,247
I can get us in.

55
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,526
Come on!

56
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,289
I don't wanna get in trouble.

57
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,882
It's a shame, don't you think?

58
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,850
All those strings inside him broke.

59
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,280
QUENTIN: Margo always loved mysteries.

60
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,620
And in everything that came after,

61
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,370
I could never stop thinking...

62
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,727
maybe she loved them so much...

63
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,969
she became one.

64
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,091
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

65
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,246
A lot changed
in the years that followed.

66
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,881
Margo and I sort of... drifted apart.

67
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,129
(DOORBELL RINGING)

68
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,529
But I never stopped
thinking about her...

69
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,887
I'll get it! I'll get it.

70
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,409
...and hoping I'd get a second chance.

71
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,206
CHILDREN: Trick or treat!

72
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,860
QUENTIN: Yeah. Happy Halloween, guys.

73
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,820
- (HONKING)
- (ENGINE REVVING)

74
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,126
QUENTIN: It wasn't just me.

75
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,170
Pretty much everyone recognized...

76
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,020
Margo was different.

77
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,460
(LAUGHING)

78
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,722
Margo was...

79
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,244
special.

80
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,060
Her life had become a series

81
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,811
of unbelievably epic adventures.

82
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,441
Each one too insane to be true.

83
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,540
Like the time she spent three weeks

84
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,404
traveling with the circus.

85
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,281
Or the time she toured with the
Mallionaires up and down the East Coast.

86
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,851
Look, if you ask the bassist...

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,780
he's either gonna say I'm his girlfriend

88
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,881
or he wants me to be...

89
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,928
Either way I'm going back there...

90
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,721
so you might as well make it easier
for yourself and just let me in.

91
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,889
QUENTIN: And wherever she went...

92
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,604
she always left clues behind
for her little sister, Ruthie.

93
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,260
Or anyone else she deemed worthy.

94
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,361
(CREAKING)

95
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,483
I was never one of those people.

96
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,420
As senior year drew to a close,

97
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,329
Margo and I barely talked at all.

98
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,563
MRS. JACOBSEN: It's your senior prom.

99
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,011
I don't understand the objection.

100
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,447
QUENTIN: I have so many objections, Mom.

101
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,620
Like slow dancing.

102
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,085
And fast dancing. Any kind of dancing.

103
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,651
And wearing a rented tux.

104
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,370
You could take Suzie Chung.

105
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,289
No, we're not a thing anymore.

106
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,246
But she was such a nice girl.
What happened with you two?

107
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,329
I don't know, it just...

108
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,649
Just didn't work out.

109
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,727
Hi, Ben. Hi, Radar.

110
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,644
- Hi, Mrs. Jacobsen.
- Hey, Mrs. Jacobsen.

111
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,929
- I would hit that so hard.
- (GROANS)

112
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,606
I don't see it.

113
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,841
What? Q!

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,889
I'm not saying
I just wanna bang your mom.

115
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,371
- She should be respected.
- Stop.

116
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,921
Admired. You know, she's a real lady.

117
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,860
Yeah, she's my mom.

118
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,849
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
I wanna ride bikes with her.

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,081
What?

120
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,887
I'd feed her grapes, take her to Paris.

121
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,883
Treat her like the princess she is.
What, is that wrong?

122
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,087
It's weird.

123
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,844
It's always weird.

124
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,020
- I wanna give her a bath.
- (GROANS)

125
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,220
That's gonna be so...

130
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,810
Hey, honey bunny.
How's prom looking for you?

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,729
Not a chance, Bloody Ben.

132
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,849
No.

133
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,806
No!

134
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,523
Freshmen know that story?

135
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,046
QUENTIN: When Ben was 12...

136
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,380
he got a kidney infection

137
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,086
- and started literally pissing blood.
- Oh, God.

138
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,969
QUENTIN: By the time he came
back from the hospital...

139
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,770
a rumor had spread through
the entire school...

140
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,084
that his condition was the result
of chronic masturbation.

141
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,768
I'm never gonna get a prom date, am I?

142
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,900
Don't worry about it.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,764
Prom is a waste of time
and a waste of money.

144
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,160
Radar's going to prom.

145
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,243
Radar has a girlfriend,
so he has to go to prom.

146
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,686
Lame.

147
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,602
Radar, has she been to your house yet?

148
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,127
Oh, yeah. Has your girlfriend
come to your house yet?

149
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,700
- Stop.
- Isn't there a certain reason

150
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,801
why she doesn't come to your house?

151
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,980
Radar, what up with that?

152
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,380
You know very well "what up with that."

153
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,720
We just like to hear you say it.

154

- Could you tell us again?

the world's largest collection

160
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,731
You heard that correctly.

161
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,840
Radar's parents were trying to get into
The Guinness Book of World Records...

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,844
for the largest collection
of black Santas in one house.

163
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,410
There were over a thousand.

164
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,405
And they were everywhere.

165
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,649
And not just at Christmas.

166
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,180
Even so, Radar was the first one of us

167
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,169
to get a serious girlfriend.

168
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,780
RADAR: You need a prom date.

169
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,928
Why don't you ask that girl
you slept with at summer camp?

170
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,201
Oh. She's made up.

171
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,500
No, she's not.

172
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,500
But you can ask the girl
from Saskatchewan.

173
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,364
Oh, yeah, you could ask...
Oh, no, she's also made up.

174
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,648
No, they are both real. Not made up.

175
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,126
- QUENTIN: Define "real."
- I don't know.

176

- Hey.

00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,051
- Hey. Let's go.
- We have 10 minutes.

179
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,406
No, we're fine. Let's go.

180
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,726
BEN: Hi, Angela.

181
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,860
Bye, Angela.

182
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,100
It was nice talking to you, Angela.

183
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,326
Oh, God. She's great.

184
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,487
Glad we can have these chats.

185
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,201
QUENTIN: So most of my days
were exactly like this.

186
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,687
I threw myself into my classes...

187
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,690
SATs, extracurriculars.

188
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,809
By the end of high school...

189
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,769
I barely thought of her at all.

190
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,300
I just had to graduate,
go off to college,

191
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,640
find someone new.

192
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,330
And forget the miracle ever happened.

193
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,322
And it almost worked out that way.

194
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,724
Until this one night.

Margo, hey.

200
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,165
I need to borrow your car.

201
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,606
- What?
- Your car.

202
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,006
I don't have a car.

203
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,446
I mean your mom's car.

204

Why can't you use your car?

205
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,900
My parents locked the keys in the safe

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,047
beneath their bed.

207
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,687
And while I'm sure I could go
in there and crack the combo...

208
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,967
it just so happens
that Myrna Mountweazel's in there

209
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,088
and that goddamn dog despises me.

210
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,900
Anyway, so like I said,
I need to borrow your car.

211
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,980
Mmm-mmm.

212
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,162
Also, I need you to drive the car...

213
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,448
because I have nine things
I need to do tonight...

require a getaway driver.

I gotta go, so are you in or out?

221

Why can't you just get one
of your underlings to help you out?

Like Jase, or Lacey, or Becca?

They're part of the problem, actually.

What problem?

225
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,050
There are nine problems.

226
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,891
And your boyfriend's one of them?

227
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,525
Ex-boyfriend.

228

We're going shopping?

No, we're not going shopping.

You're a very anxious person,
aren't you, Q?

240
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,405
I'm not an anxious person. I just...

241
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,244
I have plans and goals.

242
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,046
None of which involve jail or dying.

Pull in here.

244
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,047
- So, what plans?
- Huh?

245

You said you had plans.

246
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,124
Uh... I just meant I'm going
to Duke in the fall...

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,964
then go to med school
and become an oncologist...

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,407
and obviously...

249
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,881
get married and have kids by 30.

250
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,928
- And then you'll be happy?
- Huh?

00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,404
I'm gonna be back.

982
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,404
(PANTING)

983
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,321
JASE: You're so much better than her.

984
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,528
- BECCA: Yeah, Jase?
- JASE: Yeah.

985
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,760
Becca.

986
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,081
(DOOR CREAKS SOFTLY)

987
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,084
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

988
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:51,900
(URINATING)

989
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,286
- Who's there?
- Whoa!

990
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,766
- Hi. Lacey.
- (CONTINUES URINATING)

991
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,082
What the hell are you doing in here?

992
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,083
I'm just peeing.

993
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,740
Well, stop.

994
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,047
- I can't just stop like that.
- Okay, fine.

995
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,725
Finish and then get out.

996
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,081
Okay.

997
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,370
(CHUCKLING) Sorry about that.

998
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,121
(WATER RUNNING)

999
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,641
You okay, Lacey?

1000
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,762
I've been better.

1001
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,609
You wanna get in the tub with me?

1002
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,000
Not like that.

1003
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,004
Not like that!

1004
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,480
Um...

1005
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,090
Yeah, sure.

1006
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,445
LACEY: Look at me.

1007
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,681
Huh?

1008
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,690
What's the first word
that pops into your head?

1009
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,091
I don't know. I can't...

1010
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,287
Come on.

1011
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,161
Beautiful.

1012
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,522
See, no. No.

1013
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,011
Okay.

1014
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,681
QUENTIN: What?

1015
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,365
That's the problem.

1016
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,684
No one ever looks at me
and thinks that I'm smart...

1017
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,280
or clever...

1018
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,204
or interesting, you know?

1019
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,206
I have a brain. I'm going to Dartmouth.

1020
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,260
So, uh...

1021
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,203
Is that what you're upset about?

1022
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,340
(EXHALES)

1023
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,681
Becca and I got in a fight.

1024
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:42,811
She called me a bitch and a whore.

1025
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,020
And then she stood on a couch

1026
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,724
and shushed the entire party

1027
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,644
and told them I have chlamydia.

1028
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,780
- Oh, man.
- Yeah. Which, I don't.

1029
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,565
- Yeah.
- Anymore.

1030
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,961
But, I'm not a slut.

1031
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,889
I don't think you're a slut.

1032
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,460
Thanks.

1033
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,211
Don't even... Becca's just jealous.

1034
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,561
Why would Becca be jealous?

1035
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,485
She's dating Jase.
She's gonna be prom queen.

1036
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,722
She's basically the new Margo.

1037
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,244
No one will ever be the new Margo.

1038
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,725
(CHUCKLES)

1039
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,206
You're right.

1040
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,761
No one could ever be the new Margo.

1041
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:21,881
(DOOR OPENS)

1042
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,925
Really?

1043
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,010
- I hate that guy.
- Me, too.

1044
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,924
- He's the worst.
- The worst.

1045
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,609
Here, let me help you up.

1046
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,241
Thanks.

1047
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,446
Hey, if anyone gives you any trouble...

1048
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,047
Thanks.

1049
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,202
- I can't fight, but...
- Thank you.

1050
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,602
Hey. I'm gonna catch up with you.

1051
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,285
- Okay.
- Okay.

1052
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,841
BEN: Valar morghulis!

1053
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,365
RADAR: Dude, put your shirt on.
Get down.

1054
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:01,445
- Valar morghulis!
- How much did he drink?

1055
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,643
I think it's stuck to my hand.

1056
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,651
Hey, Ben?

1057
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,847
Yes, Quentin, approach.

1058
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,180
I pronounce thee a knight

1059
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,770
of the Hefeweizen Order, all right?

1060
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,169
Thanks, Ben. Hey, we gotta go.

1061
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,260
No, I wanna party.

1062
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,441
I think I know where Margo is.

1063
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,647
- Wait, for real?
- Yeah.

1064
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:16,841
BEN: Lacey!

1065
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,366
Lacey!

1066
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,883
I have to tell you something, okay?

1067
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,528
It's not the beer talking, okay?
It's the me talking.

1068
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,722
I just needed beer...

1069
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,451
to get the words
from my brain to my mouth.

1070
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,281
I wanted to say this
for a really long time.

01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,884
QUENTIN: Ben? You all right?

1075
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,400
Let's get out of here.

1076
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,380
BEN: I feel so much better.

1077
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,460
QUENTIN: Let's go, buddy.

1078
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,483
- BEN: God save the Queen!
- RADAR: Stop.

1079
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,846
BEN: Radar, I love you.

1080
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,405
RADAR: Don't kiss me.

1081
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,300
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

1082
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,460
BEN: I love you.

1083
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,220
RADAR: It's not that shady-ass
shopping center, is it?

1084
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,300
QUENTIN: What?

1085
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,401
RADAR: Q!

1086
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,730
Oh, God.

1087
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,006
Isn't this far enough?

1088
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,764
No. Come on, guys.

1089
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:07,921
Let's sing a song.

1090
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,081
What?

1091
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,083
You don't get as scared if you sing.

1092
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,049
Okay. What should we sing?

1093
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,531
I don't know, anything.

1094
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:20,003
Maybe just sing the first song
that pops into your head.

1095
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,927
I wanna be the very best

1096
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:31,090
Like no one ever was

1097
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,969
To catch them is my real test

1098
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,361
To train them is my cause

1099
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,045
That's the first song
that popped in your head?

1100
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,201
It's working.

1101
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:45,526
I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide

1102
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,531
Each Pokémon to understand

1103
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,961
The power that's inside

1104
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,966
Pokémon! Gotta catch 'em
It's you and me

1105
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,600
I know it's my destiny, Pokémon!

1106
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:02,402
Oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend

1107
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,281
Pokémon! Gotta catch 'em
A heart so true

1108
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,602
Your courage will pull us through

1109
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,331
You teach me and I'll teach you

1110
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,723
Pokémon! Gotta catch 'em all

1111
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,841
Gotta catch 'em all, gotta catch 'em all

1112
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,300
- Gotta catch 'em all

1114
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,841
Hey!

1115
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,220
Oh... Jesus Christ.

1116
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,300
Lacey?

1117
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,084
You scared the shit out of us.

1118
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,441
(GRUNTS)

1119
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,841
What are you guys doing here?

1120
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,081
What are you doing here?

1121
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,843
I followed you.

1122
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,128
I don't know.
I thought maybe you found her.

1123
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,085
No, she's not here...

1124
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,969
but I think I know where she might be.

1125
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,764
Guys, come on. This way.

1126
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,602
I wasn't scared before, back there.

1127
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,884
LACEY: Okay.

1128
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:09,045
Just love me some Pikachu.

1129
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,322
I'm more of a Charizard girl.

1130
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,041
What is it?

1131
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,207
Margo hung something here...

1132
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,330
and I think it was a map.

1133
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,241
Okay.

1134
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,089
QUENTIN: This is Margo's map.

1135
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,608
And this is where she used to hang it.

1136
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,444
So where is she now?

1137
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,360
QUENTIN: Let's see.

1138
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,931
She is...

1139
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,964
somewhere...

1140
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,884
in upstate New York.

1141
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,646
Can you be any less specific?

1142
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,804
This... general area.

1143
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,371
Is there a town?

There's nothing there, bro.

1147

There has to be something there.

1148
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:57,769
Roscoe, Rockland, Beaverkill,
Agloe, Chatham, Wallaceberg.

These are all the towns
in that general vicinity.

1150
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,126
Are any of them paper towns?

1151
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,380
What's a paper town?

1152
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,561
It's a fake city that map makers
would put on their maps...

1153
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,380
so if they get copied
illegally, they'd know...

1154
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,540
- ...that they're being copied.
- Whoa.

1155
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,660

staying in to watch the Cosmos marathon?

to hang out with your friends.

01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,921
and nasty tater tots in the cafeteria.

1463
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,082
Last homeroom, last science lab.

1464
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:47,651
These are all terrible, terrible things.

1465
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,609
That we're never gonna get to do again.

1466
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,460
And, like, this stuff.

1467
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,561
Hmm?

1468
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,564
Well, I'm going to UCF.

1469
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,140
You're going to North Carolina,

1470
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,765
you're going to Boston.

1471
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,560
We've known each other
since we were fetuses.

1472
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,969
And it's not gonna be like that anymore.

1473
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,723
And that's gonna suck for me.

1474
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,125
Me, too.

1475
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,602
Stop. You guys are bumming me out.

1476
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,168
We can't sleep.

1477
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,481
ANGELA: You wanna take a walk?

1478
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,766
Sure.

1479
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,170
- LACEY: Hey.
- BEN: Hey.

1480
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,731
You cold?

1481
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,881
Yeah.

1482
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,561
Actually...

1483
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:37,420
I'm feeling like I'm gonna probably

1484
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,567
get some sleep, too.

1485
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:41,641
Yeah.

1486
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:43,771
BEN: All right, see you.

1487
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,126
LACEY: Bye.

1488
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,402
What was it you wanted to tell me...

1489
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:56,770
back at Jase's house,
before you puked yourself?

1490
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,081
(LAUGHS)

1491
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:00,960
Nah.

1492
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,287
It was something stupid, probably.

1493
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,445
I don't know.
I didn't really know you then.

1494
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,921
You're not kind of what I had thought.

1495
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,321
What'd you think?

1496
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:14,687
You know...

1497
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:15,887
(CHUCKLING) What?

1498
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,764
That you were hot...

1499
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,685
and your face...

1500
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,121
and torso.

1501
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,765
I'm sorry.

1502
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:30,049
Listen, you are all those
things, obviously.

1503
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,480
But, um...

1504
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,403
You're also pretty cool.

1505
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,571
Drive all this way for your friend,
I don't know.

1506
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,728
If you ask me, someone like Margo
doesn't really deserve you.

1507
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,406
You know?

1508
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,481
Would you wanna go to prom with me?

1509
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,401
Yes.

1510
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,580
(CHUCKLES)

1511
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:09,727
Okay.

1512
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:10,927
Yes.

1513
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,241
Okay.

1514
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,287
Yes.

1515
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,649
(LAUGHING) Wait, say that again?

1516
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,245
You're really gonna
make me say it again?

1517
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,289
Black Santas?

1518
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,727
I know. I know.

1519
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,967
I know it sounds weird.

1520
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,361
It's actually 20 times
weirder in person.

1521
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:33,561
No, I think it's progressive.

1522
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:35,966
(LAUGHING) No, you don't!

1523
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:39,090
I do! Santa is a construct.

1524
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,220
It doesn't make sense

1525
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,209
that he's always an old white guy.

1526
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,740
I think that it's cool
that your parents are willing

1527
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,604
to embrace the complexity of that idea.

1528
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,410
Yeah, I think about that
every morning...

1529
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,768
when I eat my Lucky Charms
with a little black Santa spoon.

1530
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,020
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1531
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,340
You don't have to speak

1532
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:22,525
Just keep me company

1533
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:31,290
Be mine

1534
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:38,242
Be mine

1535
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,642
Be mine

1536
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,481
QUENTIN: Cool. Thank you.

1537
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,846
MAN: So long.

1538
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,806
Hey.

1539
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,285
What's that look on your face?

1540
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:07,289
What? What look?

1541
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:10,211
You look like...
You're acting very strange.

1542
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,686
(SCOFFS) You are.

1543
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,524
You got a weird little
grin on your face.

1544
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:14,700
What is that about?

1545
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:15,820
I don't know what you're talking about.

1546
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,570
Scoot! Scoot.

1547
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:19,180
Ben, did you notice something about him?

1548
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,486
He looks kinda strange, like he's...

1549
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,648
You're grinning or something.
What happened?

1550
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:24,761
I have news.

1551
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:26,681
What?

1552
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,044
I'm going to prom with Lacey Pemberton.

1553
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,725
- Holy shit! Really?
- Yeah.

1554
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:31,967
- Congratulations, man.
- I know, dude.

1555
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,451
Bloody Ben and Lacey Pemberton.

1556
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,011
Angela and I had sex.

1557
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,161
Dude!

1558
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,481
- BEN: What?
- What?

1559
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:38,940
You just had sex with Angela?

1560
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,020
Bro, are you serious?

1561
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,167
Yeah. Don't tell her I told you.

1562
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,089
What are you guys talking about?

1563
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,081
- Books.
- (CHUCKLES)

1564
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,445
- Books?
- Books?

1565
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,444
I told them.

1566
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:53,927
Bro.

1567
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,122
I thought you could make it to Scranton.

1568
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,810
I really did.

1569
01:22:58,960 --> 01:22:59,961
- Shotgun!
- Move!

1570
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,571
All right, Radar, big man,
what's the ETA?

1571
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:08,140
If we continue at yesterday's pace,
we should be there in four hours.

1572
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:09,220
All right.

1573
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,527
Dude, awesome. That leaves
an hour to find Margo...

1574
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,250
tell her you love her.

1575
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:15,607
Back in time for an amazing prom.

1576
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,361
Agloe, here we come.

1577
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,521
(ENGINE STARTS)

1578
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,928
BEN: Hey! Check it out,
ladies and gentlemen.

1579
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,564
RADAR: This is insane.

1580
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,841
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1581
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,620
On a drive I'm taking backroads

1582
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:47,740
High against where
the rivers are flowing

1583
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:52,767
I didn't think that our love had grown

1584
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,860
Cross the bridge

1585
01:23:55,960 --> 01:24:00,100
To redefine your pain

1586
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,860
Wide awake

1587
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:06,540
I rearrange the way I listen in the dark

1588
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:11,931
Dreaming of starting up again

1589
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,420
RADAR: According to Omnictionary,

1590
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,931
this should be it.

1591
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:10,840
Margo?

1592
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,164
(INHALES DEEPLY)

1593
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,646
BEN: No?

1594
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,290
QUENTIN: Let's look around.

1595
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,961
Okay.

1596
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,321
Yeah, all right.

1597
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,530
(SIGHS)

1598
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,323
How are we doing on time?

1599
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:43,081
If we wanna make it back for prom,
we should probably...

1600
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:45,380
go.

1601
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,482
She'll be here. I know it.

1602
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:53,051
- Q...
- She'll be here. I know it.

1603
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,850
I know it.

1604
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,170
It's time to go, Q.

1605
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,001
He's right.

1606
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:04,003
Guys, we can't give up yet. It's Margo.

1607
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,162
She's probably sitting,
watching right now, laughing.

1608
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:07,300
This is our final test.

1609
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,640
You promised we'd be back for prom.

1610
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,450
Not that again. Seriously?

1611
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:11,580
I don't wanna miss prom, either.

1612
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:14,140
Five seconds ago, you couldn't get a date
to prom if your life depended on it.

1613
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:16,227
And now, suddenly, it's the end
of the world if you're not there.

1614
01:27:16,328 --> 01:27:20,163
Just because you don't give a shit about
prom it doesn't mean that nobody else does.

1615
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,322
Prom is more important
than your best friend?

1616
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,646
That's what you're saying?

1617
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:27,286
No. That's not what I'm saying.

1618
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:30,020
Why did you even come
if you're not gonna see this through?

1619
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,380
Because I thought it would be fun...

1620
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,100
because I wanted to spend time
with my two best friends...

1621
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,321
before we leave for college
and probably never see each other again.

1622
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,567
Yeah, wasn't this fun for you?

1623
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,370
Not if I don't find Margo.
Don't you get it?

1624

What about you, Lacey?
Don't you wanna find her?

LACEY: I thought I did...

1629
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,408
but you know what, Quentin?

1630
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:57,484
I came all this way because
I was worried about her.

1631
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,290
Do you think she'd do the same for me?

1632
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,448
Would she do it for you?

1633

Come on.

1634
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,885
I'm gonna stay.

I'm gonna find a bus back to Orlando.

1636

Have a great prom, everybody.

Go. Go.

01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,885
Are you serious?

1640
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,126
Q, let's go.

1641
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,940
I'm not going! Okay? I'm not going!

1642
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,122
All right, great. Good luck!

Quentin.

1649

Hi!

1650
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,881
I knew I'd find you. I knew it.

1651
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,962
I can't believe you're here.

1652
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,646
How are you?

1653
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,364
Wait, what? What do you mean
you can't believe I'm here?

1654
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,729
I'm just a little surprised.

1655
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,220
Wait, what are you surprised about?

1656
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:41,810
I followed the clues...

1657
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:43,450
I found that note
that you left in my door...

1658
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:46,007
and then I saw the "You will
go to the paper towns..."

1659
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:47,491
I read the whole Walt Whitman...

1660
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:49,766
and, you know...

1661
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:54,121
You left those clues for me, right?

1662
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,409
Yeah, I always leave clues...

1663
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:58,580
Yeah.

1664
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:02,127
...so you'd know I was fine.
That I was okay.

1665
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:09,684
I didn't think you would
come all this way.

1666
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:17,002
Wait, what did you think?

1667
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:22,051
Quentin, what are you doing here?

1668
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,282
I'm in love with you.

1669
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,407
You're in love with me.

1670

Yes.

1672
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:42,481
come on.

1673
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,722
I've loved you since we were kids.

1674
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:48,926
And I've never stopped loving you
every single day since.

1675
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,202
You're not in love with me.

1676
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,964
Don't say that.

1677
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,804
You don't even know me.

1678
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,411
Yeah, I do. Don't say that I don't...

1679
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,767
I don't even know me.

1680
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:02,208
Q, I have no idea who I am.

1681
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:05,011
Why do you think I'm here?

1682
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:09,801
I...

1683
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:12,921
I thought...

1684
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:25,371
Why are you here?

1685
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:30,568
Can I buy you a drink?

1686
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:33,041
Thank you.

1687
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:36,286
I'd been planning to leave
for a while, actually.

1688
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:39,690
I would graduate,
do the whole cap and gown thing...

1689
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:42,884
and then, the next morning... Poof.

1690
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:44,521
Into thin air.

1691
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:48,088
And then I found out about
the whole Jase thing, and that was it.

1692
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:50,967
I couldn't take another
second of that place.

1693
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,285
It was really that bad?

1694
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:54,606
You know what it's like.

1695
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:55,841
Yeah, but...

1696
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,740
I don't know. You had everything.

1697
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,330
You were Margo Roth Spiegelman.

1698
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:01,369
That's it. That's the problem, Q.

1699
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,602
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1700
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,047
People have always looked at me

1701
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,447
and seen what they wanted to see.

1702
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:11,521
And yes, I know...

1703
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:14,126
I cultivated it a little.

1704
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:16,806
"The myth of Margo Roth Spiegelman."

1705
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,526
But it's just a fantasy.

1706
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:22,920
And there we were...

1707
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,700
at the top of the SunTrust building,

1708
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,121
looking down on the city.

1709
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:29,687
And all I could think about...

1710
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:34,361
was how I felt just as paper
as everything else.

1711
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:38,961
Hmm.

1712
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,609
So then you came here?

1713
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:46,130
A paper town for a paper girl.

1714
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,780
Not a lot to do, but it's a great place

1715
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:51,405
to read and think.

1716
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:55,720
Can I ask you something?

1717
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:57,120
Of course.

1718
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:02,566
Where do I fit in to all this?

1719
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:05,060
You were my first partner in crime.

1720
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:07,288
I wanted you to be my last.

1721
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,244
And you surprised me that night.

1722
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,410
You really did.

1723
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,924
You're a way better ninja
than I expected.

1724
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,651
You know, Q, I'm really sorry.

1725
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,211
For what?

1726
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:30,001
For all of it.

1727
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:32,764
The clues.

1728
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:35,207
Not being a better friend.

1729
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:38,402
Ruining your last few weeks
of high school.

1730
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,211
You didn't.

1731
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:47,900
What?

1732
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,890
You didn't ruin my last
few weeks of high school.

1733
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,451
In fact...

1734
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,565
I think they were
the best weeks of my life.

1735
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:01,928
First party.

1736
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,050
First road trip.

1737
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:07,007
My first time cutting class.

1738
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,125
Everybody else is doing things
for the last time...

1739
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:18,161
but I was doing them
for the first. So...

1740
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,450
don't apologize.

1741
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:23,246
Because...

1742
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:27,247
none of that would have
happened without you.

1743
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,761
Are you sure you don't
want to come back?

1744
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:48,604
College, job, husband.

1745
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:51,001
The allure of a life rightly lived.

1746
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:54,363
That's not me. You know it isn't.

1747
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:59,364
So, what's the plan?

1748
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:02,326
I have absolutely no idea...

1749
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,687
but I'm excited to find out.

1750
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:10,964
You know, you...

1751
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,170
you may not be the myth
we made you out to be...

1752
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:17,405
but you're still pretty something.

1753
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,121
You're pretty something yourself.

1754
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:49,562
You could come with me, you know.

1755
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,020
You can't imagine how many times

1756
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:55,566
I dreamed you would say those words.

1757
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:03,085
But I have to go.

1758
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:12,881
Hey.

1759
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:16,844
Do you want to call your sister?

1760
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,729
She misses you.

1761
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,126
We talk every day.

(SIGHS)

1763
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,690
I'll see you.

1764
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:49,820
What a treacherous thing it is

1765
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,161
to believe that a person
is more than a person.

1766
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:57,647
Margo was not a miracle.
She was not an adventurer.

1767
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,851
She was not some fine, precious thing.

1768
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,161
She was a girl.

1769
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:17,443
It took me a long time
to realize how wrong I was.

1770
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,723
And not just about Margo.

1771
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:27,127
I was wrong about a lot of things.

1772
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:38,931
I used to believe
everyone gets a miracle.

1773
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:42,165
And I still do.

1774
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,842
But as it turns out...

1775
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,324
my miracle...

1776
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:52,170
was this.

1777
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:55,003
Don't stop, no, I'll never give up

1778
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,420
And I'll never look back
just hold your head up

1779
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,807
And if it gets rough
it's time to get rough

1780
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:01,900
They keep saying

1781
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,604
Don't stop, no, it's never enough

1782
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,002
I'll never look back never give up

1783
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:08,567
And if it gets rough
it's time to get rough

1784
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,860
But now I'm falling, falling

1785
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:13,689
Falling, falling, falling

1786
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:17,448
Falling, falling, falling, falling, oh

1787
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:20,244
Now we're going down

1788
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:25,803
And I can feel the eyes
are watching us so closely

1789
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:29,763
I'm trying not to make a sound

1790
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:34,288
'Cause I'll be found out somehow

1791
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:37,929
Don't stop, no, I'll never give up

1792
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:40,100
And I'll never look back
just hold your head up

1793
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,043
And if it gets rough
it's time to get rough

1794
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:46,444
Don't stop no it's never enough

1795
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:48,529
I'll never look back never give up

1796
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:50,968
And if it gets rough
it's time to get rough

1797
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,726
So maybe we won't all win the lottery.

1798
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:01,961
Or marry royalty.

1799
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:05,322
Or make that last-second shot.

1800
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:15,651
But that doesn't mean we won't
have amazing adventures...

1801
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:17,881
Aw...

1802
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:19,481
I want one.

1803
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:21,847
...meet exceptional people...

1804
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,161
(ALL LAUGHING)

1805
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:28,047
and make indelible memories.

1806
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:33,447
The trick is...

1807
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,685
to notice.

1808
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:41,367
Before it's too late.

1809
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:45,925
Oh, and Margo?

1810
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:50,140
Someone said they saw her in New York,

1811
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:52,811
starring in a revival
of The Fantasticks.

1812
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:57,020
Someone else said
she's on the West Coast

1813
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:59,521
teaching surf lessons in Malibu.

1814
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:05,368
I don't listen to those rumors anymore.

1815
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,040
Wherever she is...

1816
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:19,769
whatever she's up to...

1817
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:22,722
I'm sure it's pretty something.

1818
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:26,925
But, hey...

1819
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:29,802
that's her story to tell.

1820
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:33,121
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1821
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:38,300
I know it's not the right time tonight

1822
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:41,449
But I won't move until this stops

1823
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:44,040
Go back to the top

1824
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,968
Back to the top

1825
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:57,242
I'm not scared if you run to me

1826
01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:00,201
Lost like when you were mine

1827
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:07,580
You can take what you want from me

1828
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:13,084
Just don't offer me your time

1829
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:22,122
Stay, life can be long

1830
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:27,411
Wanna know, wanna know,
wanna know, wanna know it's true

1831
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:33,247
When you say I want you around

1832
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,644
Gotta make me believe you

1833
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:45,020
I know it's not the right time tonight

1834
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:48,203
But I won't move until this stops

1835
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:50,721
Go back to the top

1836
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:56,448
Back to the top

1837
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:08,940
I know it's not the right time tonight

1838
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:12,060
But I won't move until this stops

1839
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:14,322
Go back to the top

1840
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:19,528
Back to the top
