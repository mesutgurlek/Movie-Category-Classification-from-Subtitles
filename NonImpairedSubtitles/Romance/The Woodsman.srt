1
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:09,309
On your left.

2
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:12,501
On your right.

3
00:01:17,897 --> 00:01:20,586
You must check in
with your P.O. Once a week.

4
00:01:20,621 --> 00:01:23,275
Your P.O. Is entitled
to visit at any time.

5
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,886
You cannot come
within 300 feet of...

6
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:30,789
You must register immediately
upon return...

7
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:26,950
- Walter?
- Hey, Bob.

8
00:02:26,985 --> 00:02:28,976
It's good to see you.

9
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:31,731
That's Mary-Kay.

10
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:39,024
The only reason I'm doing this is 'cause
I know you did good work for my father.

11
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,727
So you be here on time.
You do your work.

12
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,395
I don't want
any kind of problem, period.

13
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:42,121
God, that looks awful.

14
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:44,021
Yeah.

15
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,988
Now, this looks good.

16
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:54,386
Want some? Homemade.

17
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:56,548
No, thanks.

18
00:03:57,545 --> 00:04:00,173
You won't taste
a better chicken salad in town.

19
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,569
I said no, thank you.

20
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:10,402
I'm sorry. I got to get back to work.

21
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:45,669
- So, how are you adjusting?
- I'm adjusting okay.

22
00:04:45,704 --> 00:04:49,067
- And your new apartment?
- Apartment's okay.

23
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:51,900
- How's the job?
- The job's okay.

24
00:04:51,913 --> 00:04:55,747
Do I take "okay" to mean
you feel good about working there?

25
00:04:56,969 --> 00:04:58,869
I said the job's okay.

26
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:01,750
That's right. You did.

27
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:23,125
- Vicki!
- Fuck you, asshole.

28
00:05:23,177 --> 00:05:26,169
- Come on. What's wrong, huh?
- Kiss my ass.

29
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:43,718
Boy, you still think fast.

30
00:05:43,753 --> 00:05:46,244
You don't need to think fast
to handle a beer.

31
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:49,582
Well, it took some talking
to convince your super I was a relative.

32
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:52,458
Yeah, well, I told her
all my relatives were good-looking.

33
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:55,299
- Jesus Christ, man, it's good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

34
00:05:56,553 --> 00:05:58,077
You look good...

35
00:05:58,153 --> 00:06:00,621
damn good,
considering you're an old man now.

36
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:04,183
Feels like the whole world's
gotten younger.

37
00:06:05,512 --> 00:06:07,639
So, you're doing okay?

38
00:06:07,657 --> 00:06:09,124
Yeah, I'm okay.

39
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:11,884
- How's business?
- Booming.

40
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:15,747
Can't keep up with the work.
In fact, I just hired a few new guys.

41
00:06:16,713 --> 00:06:19,238
Just until, you know, we catch up.

42
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:31,501
Living across the street
from a grade school. Jesus.

43
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:34,453
Something wrong with that?

44
00:06:36,361 --> 00:06:38,261
I'm just thinking of the noise.

45
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:42,423
It's the only landlord in town
who'll take my money.

46
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:48,501
So, how's Annette?

47
00:06:49,193 --> 00:06:51,058
A little tense.

48
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,571
You know, you're the only member
of the family still speaking to me.

49
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:55,704
Yeah, well, I remember when
they all gave Annette shit...

50
00:06:55,721 --> 00:07:00,420
because she married the brown-skinned boy
from down the street- except her brother.

51
00:07:00,455 --> 00:07:02,261
And what about Annette?

52
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:05,045
I'm workin' on it.

53
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:13,222
- So how old is Carla?
- She's gonna be 12 next week.

54
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:16,532
We're gonna throw her
a big party on Saturday.

55
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:20,505
I wish I could ask you to come.

56
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,404
Good enough
to eat today, baby.

57
00:07:52,424 --> 00:07:54,982
Ooh, yeah.

58
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,917
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, huh?

59
00:07:56,937 --> 00:08:00,202
How'd you like it if someone did
that shit to your sister, huh?

60
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:02,069
Piece of shit!

61
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:07,770
Fuck off!
Clean that shit up!

62
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,258
- Oh, yeah.
- Play with yourself, asshole!

63
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:27,445
You okay?

64
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,433
What?

65
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:33,112
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.

66
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:53,796
So, what'd he do?

67
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:59,257
- What did who do?
- You know, the new guy.

68
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,707
Drugs, armed robbery,
manslaughter...

69
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:07,049
Mind your business, Mary-Kay.

70
00:09:11,144 --> 00:09:13,009
Have you made any friends there?

71
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:15,024
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.

72
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,446
You seem a little hostile today.

73
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:20,309
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.

74
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:23,526
No need to call me doctor.
I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.

75
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:25,294
It's all the same to me.

76
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:29,692
Walter, I'd like you
to try something for me.

77
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:32,561
- What's that?
- I'd like you to keep a journal.

78
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:35,044
- No fuckin' way.
- Why not?

79
00:09:35,944 --> 00:09:37,536
Evidence.

80
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:40,670
Perhaps a journal would
encourage you to reflect.

81
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:44,598
Try it?

82
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,714
Sixteen, 17, 18, 19, 20.

83
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,647
320 feet.

84
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:27,476
How about that?

85
00:11:26,408 --> 00:11:28,308
Want a ride?

86
00:11:28,969 --> 00:11:32,370
- I'm all right.
- It's fucking freezing out here.

87
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:34,262
- I'm fine.
- Come on. I won't bite.

88
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:01,670
Something wrong
with this picture.

89
00:12:01,672 --> 00:12:03,731
Here's this nice, hard-working guy...

90
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:06,152
suddenly appears out of the blue.

91
00:12:06,153 --> 00:12:08,178
Takes the bus to and from work.

92
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,100
I mean, who takes
the bus anymore?

93
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:13,524
People who don't have cars.

94
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:17,916
- It's very weird.
- Not as weird as a sharp, young...

95
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:19,864
good-looking woman
working in a lumberyard.

96
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,780
Oh, yeah?
What's weird about that?

97
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,495
Most women wouldn't choose it.

98
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,250
Guess I'm not like most women.

99
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:41,204
You never spoke to me before.

100
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,635
I thought you were a dyke.

101
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:54,453
- Are you?
- What do you think?

102
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,580
You plan on drinking
both those beers?

103
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,715
I'm sorry.

104
00:13:19,688 --> 00:13:23,351
- Is that a school?
- K through sixth.

105
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,270
Doesn't it get noisy?

106
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,115
I like the noise.

107
00:13:40,648 --> 00:13:43,139
I used to think you were shy...

108
00:13:43,144 --> 00:13:44,771
but now I think it's something else.

109
00:13:47,272 --> 00:13:49,172
What?

110
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:53,390
- Something happened to you.
- Yeah?

111
00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:55,312
I'm not easily shocked.

112
00:13:56,776 --> 00:13:58,676
I get that impression.

113
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:05,615
So, you gonna tell me your dark secret?

114
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,043
Why do you want to know?

115
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,048
Don't you think I should know
before we have sex?

116
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,300
I don't like to waste time.

117
00:14:21,032 --> 00:14:23,296
So, you gonna tell me
your deep, dark secret?

118
00:14:27,656 --> 00:14:29,351
No.

119
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:32,884
Okay.

120
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:45,382
So, you're not a dyke.

121
00:15:46,408 --> 00:15:48,308
Not tonight.

122
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:54,008
Hey, that was intense.

123
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:58,079
You're still here.

124
00:15:58,088 --> 00:15:59,988
I didn't say I didn't like it.

125
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,980
What are you doing?

126
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,093
This table's a heavy little bitch, man.

127
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:46,595
It's cherry.

128
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,211
This wood. It's cherry.

129
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:52,116
It's a nice table.

130
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,730
It's my own design. You're not gonna
find another one like it in the world.

131
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:57,595
- It was a beautiful gift.
- So, why are you giving it back to me?

132
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,737
Because, man, you need a table.

133
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:03,848
Carlos, I made this table for you
and Annette as a wedding present.

134
00:17:03,883 --> 00:17:05,911
- I put a lot into it.
- I know, man.

135
00:17:05,928 --> 00:17:10,388
I love the table too.
But I also love my wife.

136
00:17:10,423 --> 00:17:12,212
Hey, you got a beer?

137
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:39,650
"I watch the kids arrive at school.

138
00:17:43,656 --> 00:17:46,716
But for the last few weeks,
I've noticed someone else watching them.

139
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:00,692
I call him Candy. "

140
00:18:50,344 --> 00:18:53,939
She's at the top
of her class at school.

141
00:18:53,974 --> 00:18:55,796
How about your kids?

142
00:18:55,816 --> 00:18:57,283
- They're good.
- Yeah?

143
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,787
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

144
00:18:58,824 --> 00:19:01,759
She's really doing great at school.

145
00:19:01,794 --> 00:19:03,635
I don't see her much, but...

146
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:13,617
- I'd keep away from him.
- What?

147
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,669
The new guy.

148
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,086
I'd keep away from him
if I were you.

149
00:19:18,088 --> 00:19:21,546
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?
- I think he's damaged goods...

150
00:19:21,581 --> 00:19:23,636
real damaged.

151
00:19:23,656 --> 00:19:26,819
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do.

152
00:19:28,488 --> 00:19:30,581
Thanks a bunch for the advice.

153
00:19:33,832 --> 00:19:35,299
Suit yourself.

154
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:52,600
Close, but no ciggy.

155
00:20:00,392 --> 00:20:01,859
Thanks, babe.

156
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,787
Thank you.

157
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:17,270
Hey, Walter.

158
00:20:18,248 --> 00:20:19,545
Hello.

159
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,667
Hello.

160
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,547
You okay?

161
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,733
Walter, what did you do?

162
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:45,236
What happened to you?

163
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:49,346
Walter?

164
00:21:54,056 --> 00:21:55,956
Why do you want to know?

165
00:21:58,344 --> 00:22:00,278
Because I like you.

166
00:22:09,256 --> 00:22:11,190
What's the worst thing
you ever did?

167
00:22:12,488 --> 00:22:14,388
The worst?

168
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:18,755
I fucked my best friend's husband.

169
00:22:22,535 --> 00:22:24,628
I mean, my best friend
since second grade.

170
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,981
He had the hots for me and...
Yeah, he was cute.

171
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:34,276
We'd get it on for days.

172
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,871
And then he told her- the shit.

173
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:40,273
Broke up their marriage.
Ruined our friendship.

174
00:22:41,223 --> 00:22:44,488
I still feel like the lowest piece of shit
when I think about that.

175
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:49,944
So, what did you do?

176
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:54,973
I molested little girls.

177
00:23:07,655 --> 00:23:09,782
Twelve years in prison is no joke.

178
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,307
How young?

179
00:23:35,272 --> 00:23:36,739
Between 10 and 12.

180
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:39,667
Once a nine-year-old
told me she was 11.

181
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:42,087
Once a 14-year-old
told me she was 12.

182
00:23:43,431 --> 00:23:45,262
I always asked
how old they were.

183
00:23:50,503 --> 00:23:52,596
What did you do to them?

184
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,700
It's not what you think.

185
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,787
I never hurt them.

186
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,907
Never.

187
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,911
Look...

188
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,854
I want you to go now, all right?

189
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,014
I told you
I'm not easily shocked.

190
00:24:21,031 --> 00:24:22,896
Yeah, well, you should be shocked.

191
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,616
- Or do you get off on this shit?
- What?

192
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:32,580
When will I be normal?

193
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,742
We have a lot of work to do.

194
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,820
- Will I ever be normal?
- What's your idea ofbeing normal?

195
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:40,566
What's your idea
of being a fuckin' shrink?

196
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,060
- Sorry.
- Watch where you're going.

197
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,048
Sorry.

198
00:26:20,615 --> 00:26:22,310
So what's happening?

199
00:26:22,343 --> 00:26:24,675
Braves are kicking the shit
out of the Phillies.

200
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,443
Fucking Phillies.

201
00:26:26,471 --> 00:26:31,374
It's just the beginning of the season.
You got to give them a chance.

202
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:42,291
- So, how was the party?
- What party?

203
00:26:42,343 --> 00:26:44,903
- The birthday party.
- Fuck. It was great.

204
00:26:44,935 --> 00:26:47,165
You should have seen Carla.
She was so pretty.

205
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:49,675
She looked like a princess.

206
00:26:49,704 --> 00:26:51,501
She's the light of my life, man.

207
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,580
You don't want
to love them too much though.

208
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,569
No such thing, man.
I couldn't love her enough.

209
00:26:59,623 --> 00:27:01,921
Oh, I've got photos.
You want to see?

210
00:27:01,928 --> 00:27:03,828
- Nah, it's all right.
- Ah, come on.

211
00:27:03,848 --> 00:27:06,544
I don't want to see
any goddamn pictures, all right?

212
00:27:08,007 --> 00:27:10,852
They're just photos
I took at the party.

213
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:15,381
Carlos, I want to see my sister
and my niece in person.

214
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:16,802
Okay?

215
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,540
Yeah, okay.

216
00:27:24,168 --> 00:27:26,329
I'm just saying Carlos
has a thing for his daughter.

217
00:27:26,343 --> 00:27:28,243
Lfhe's not careful, he's gonna suffer.

218
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:35,217
You think I'm crazy?

219
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,900
Do you think you're crazy?

220
00:27:38,504 --> 00:27:41,803
You know, talking to you is like riding
on a fuckin' merry-go-round.

221
00:27:41,838 --> 00:27:43,894
That's a marvelous image, Walter.

222
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:48,372
Because by going in circles we find things
we missed the first time around.

223
00:27:52,552 --> 00:27:54,884
When will I be normal?

224
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,652
"So what should I do?

225
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,555
Call the cops?

226
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:48,066
Yeah, that's pretty funny.

227
00:28:49,255 --> 00:28:51,917
But what if Candy seduces one
to go for a ride?

228
00:28:53,703 --> 00:28:55,671
Yeah, that's right.

229
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:59,137
If the boy goes for a ride...

230
00:28:59,143 --> 00:29:01,441
it's because he wants
to go for a ride. "

231
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,955
Walter.

232
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,966
Cop.

233
00:29:30,024 --> 00:29:33,084
Sergeant Lucas.
You mind if I come in?

234
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,530
You are in.

235
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,012
Yeah, I am.
But I always like to ask.

236
00:29:39,047 --> 00:29:41,811
It's a force of habit.
You don't mind if I look around, do you?

237
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,267
I would.

238
00:29:45,895 --> 00:29:48,523
Why, you got something to hide?

239
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:50,044
Doesn't everybody?

240
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:55,266
Have a seat.

241
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:03,842
I could get a search warrant.

242
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:07,608
Yeah, if you could get a search warrant,
you would have brought one today.

243
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,376
This cherry?

244
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,590
Yeah.

245
00:30:20,103 --> 00:30:24,506
It's a little unusual design
for a contemporary piece, but...

246
00:30:35,431 --> 00:30:36,557
Walter...

247
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:42,548
two nights ago a 10-year-old girl
got attacked not far from here.

248
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,891
That's a bit of a coincidence,
don't you think?

249
00:30:45,895 --> 00:30:48,503
- What time did it happen?
- I'll ask the questions.

250
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:51,111
If you tell me what time
it happened, maybe I could...

251
00:30:51,146 --> 00:30:53,238
Get your hands out
of your fuckin' pockets!

252
00:30:56,967 --> 00:30:59,060
Sit down!

253
00:31:16,071 --> 00:31:17,971
I know every fuckin' move
you make...

254
00:31:19,207 --> 00:31:21,471
every goddamn step.

255
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,447
When you sleep, when you eat...

256
00:31:23,463 --> 00:31:26,340
when you shit, when you jack off...

257
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:28,309
When you're sitting there
by the window...

258
00:31:28,327 --> 00:31:31,262
watching the little girls
in their cotton white dresses...

259
00:31:31,271 --> 00:31:34,172
and you're sittin' there on your little
jack-off bench, and you're jackin' off.

260
00:31:34,207 --> 00:31:36,051
Do you show your cock
to little girls when you jack off?

261
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:38,369
- You can't talk to me like...
- Like what?

262
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:41,811
Like a piece of shit? That's what
you are to me, a piece of shit.

263
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:43,700
Throw you out
that window right now.

264
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,620
Think somebody's gonna miss you?

265
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:49,291
I could say you jumped
when I came in.

266
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,851
Who you think
they're gonna believe, me or you?

267
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:55,362
You'd just be a dead piece of shit.

268
00:32:03,303 --> 00:32:05,430
We need to make sure...

269
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:07,504
that you're being
a good boy, Walter.

270
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,527
Okay?

271
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:11,802
- Okay?
- Okay.

272
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,314
Okay.

273
00:32:15,655 --> 00:32:17,122
Okay.

274
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:20,339
Have a good day.

275
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,950
Nice table.

276
00:34:23,943 --> 00:34:25,672
Yes, may I help you, please?

277
00:34:45,095 --> 00:34:47,757
- What did you think would happen?
- I don't know.

278
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:50,420
- What did you want to happen?
- I don't know!

279
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:54,851
Would you please stop writing
in the fucking pad?

280
00:34:56,231 --> 00:34:59,792
You know that if anything happens to me,
I go back to prison.

281
00:34:59,827 --> 00:35:02,049
No parole. No nothin'. For life.

282
00:35:02,055 --> 00:35:03,784
- Is this the first one?
- Of course it is!

283
00:35:03,815 --> 00:35:06,409
- Why do you think I'm telling you?
- I want you to calm down.

284
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,832
You followed a girl.

285
00:35:10,855 --> 00:35:15,019
Perhaps you wanted to see
what it felt like after so many years.

286
00:35:16,455 --> 00:35:19,390
Maybe subconsciously
you were testing yourself.

287
00:35:21,095 --> 00:35:23,460
And here you are...

288
00:35:23,495 --> 00:35:26,464
talking about it with me.

289
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,737
This is positive.

290
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,960
Walter, we'll pick up here
next week.

291
00:35:45,255 --> 00:35:47,746
Remember when
you asked me what...

292
00:35:47,783 --> 00:35:49,944
my idea of normal was?

293
00:35:51,111 --> 00:35:53,443
Normal is when I can see a girl...

294
00:35:53,447 --> 00:35:55,574
be near a girl, even talk to a girl...

295
00:35:57,511 --> 00:35:59,411
and not think about...

296
00:36:03,591 --> 00:36:05,491
That's my idea of normal.

297
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:41,299
What are you lookin' at?

298
00:38:05,831 --> 00:38:08,800
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

299
00:38:08,835 --> 00:38:10,936
A plant. I don't need a plant.

300
00:38:10,951 --> 00:38:12,816
Everyone needs a plant.

301
00:38:14,055 --> 00:38:16,708
This ivy is one tough baby.

302
00:38:16,743 --> 00:38:19,041
It's a cutting from one of mine.

303
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,604
So, here's the deal.

304
00:38:20,647 --> 00:38:22,547
Give it a little water...

305
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,694
go easy on the direct sunlight...

306
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:27,651
and notice it
every once in a while.

307
00:38:27,686 --> 00:38:29,950
They love it when you look at 'em
or touch their leaves.

308
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,330
Think you can handle that?

309
00:38:40,678 --> 00:38:42,145
Such an asshole.

310
00:38:45,062 --> 00:38:46,529
Thanks.

311
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:51,603
Want to go for a ride?

312
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:54,429
Sure.

313
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,836
Get your coat.

314
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,636
Why do you stay?

315
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:38,199
I see something in you,
something good.

316
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:41,508
You don't see it yet, but I do.

317
00:40:42,342 --> 00:40:44,742
You know, most people
say the odds are against me.

318
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:47,426
What odds?

319
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,579
Percentages...

320
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:52,499
for guys like me.

321
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,087
Most of us end up back there.

322
00:40:59,335 --> 00:41:02,168
Well, most people don't know
what they're talking about.

323
00:41:04,455 --> 00:41:07,151
You want to talk about odds?

324
00:41:07,175 --> 00:41:09,075
Someday I'll tell you how I survived...

325
00:41:09,095 --> 00:41:11,359
as the only daughter
in a family with three sons.

326
00:41:13,062 --> 00:41:16,031
Hell, maybe you should
tell me now.

327
00:41:16,066 --> 00:41:17,907
Maybe not.

328
00:41:17,927 --> 00:41:19,827
You scared?

329
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:27,253
I got poked around
here and there.

330
00:41:28,295 --> 00:41:30,354
Jesus. Which brother?

331
00:41:32,966 --> 00:41:34,991
All three, in chronological order.

332
00:41:37,478 --> 00:41:39,412
Why are you telling me this?

333
00:41:42,822 --> 00:41:45,552
I'm trying to tell you who I am,
if you're interested.

334
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,323
You must hate your brothers.

335
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:52,242
- I love my brothers.
- No, you don't.

336
00:41:55,943 --> 00:41:57,843
I love all of them.

337
00:41:59,879 --> 00:42:02,871
They're strong, gentle men
with families of their own.

338
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,905
If you ever asked them about what they did
to me, they'd beat the shit out of you.

339
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,135
And they'd call you a fucking liar.

340
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:18,610
Hey...

341
00:42:18,663 --> 00:42:20,756
I never told anyone that before.

342
00:43:00,902 --> 00:43:02,870
Yeah, he's right there.

343
00:43:14,055 --> 00:43:16,046
Hey, Jim.

344
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:37,219
Yeah. Okay.

345
00:43:37,254 --> 00:43:39,844
I'll tell him. Bye-bye.

346
00:43:39,879 --> 00:43:41,403
Bob said you wanted to see me.

347
00:43:42,374 --> 00:43:45,002
He wants everyone to sign
this card for Reggie.

348
00:43:48,263 --> 00:43:50,527
It's a baby girl.

349
00:43:50,566 --> 00:43:52,534
Reggie must be a happy man.

350
00:43:54,854 --> 00:43:57,482
I heard you're lookin'
for another job.

351
00:43:57,517 --> 00:43:59,446
Where'd you hear that?

352
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:02,820
- Around.
- I'm not lookin' for another job.

353
00:44:02,855 --> 00:44:07,451
I just heard they're looking for some
good men down at Dan Shroeder's place.

354
00:44:10,343 --> 00:44:12,436
I like my job. Thank you.

355
00:45:09,286 --> 00:45:11,914
- So, I've got some good news.
- What's that?

356
00:45:11,949 --> 00:45:13,878
Annette will see you.

357
00:45:15,238 --> 00:45:17,206
Aren't you glad?

358
00:45:18,822 --> 00:45:20,289
When?

359
00:45:20,327 --> 00:45:22,557
EarlyJuly.

360
00:45:25,671 --> 00:45:28,970
- That's three months from now.
- It's a better time.

361
00:45:29,005 --> 00:45:31,664
Carla will be away at camp.
House'll be quiet.

362
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:33,417
It's better when it's quiet.

363
00:45:33,446 --> 00:45:36,248
- Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
- Now, come on, Walter.

364
00:45:36,283 --> 00:45:39,050
You should see my appointment book.
It just got crazy.

365
00:45:39,085 --> 00:45:41,844
- It isn't what you think.
- Isn't it?

366
00:45:43,078 --> 00:45:45,876
Look, the important thing
is that you and Annette talk.

367
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:49,320
She needs to see you,
and you need to see her.

368
00:45:51,686 --> 00:45:53,779
I'm not a monster.

369
00:45:55,014 --> 00:45:56,914
Hey.

370
00:45:56,934 --> 00:46:00,597
So next week, Annette's gonna
be away for a few days, right?

371
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:03,346
And the thing is,
when Annette's away...

372
00:46:03,381 --> 00:46:05,302
I get horny as hell for other women.

373
00:46:05,318 --> 00:46:08,014
I mean, I fantasize about
fucking some beautiful woman.

374
00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:10,065
You don't have to tell me this.

375
00:46:10,087 --> 00:46:12,555
I know. I'm just sayin' I understand.

376
00:46:14,374 --> 00:46:19,523
It's crazy out there. I mean,
girls wearing mini-this, mini-that...

377
00:46:19,558 --> 00:46:22,789
Sometimes when I walk down the street
and I pass a sexy-looking woman...

378
00:46:22,824 --> 00:46:24,726
she makes me feel
like I'm bothering her.

379
00:46:24,743 --> 00:46:27,473
Hey, I see a pretty lady, I look.

380
00:46:27,494 --> 00:46:29,891
That's the price of beauty, my friend.

381
00:46:29,926 --> 00:46:33,453
You wouldn't believe the things Carla
and her friends are wearin' these days.

382
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:41,985
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

383
00:46:46,086 --> 00:46:47,553
You ever have...

384
00:46:48,486 --> 00:46:50,215
feelings for Carla?

385
00:46:51,206 --> 00:46:52,730
What do you mean?

386
00:46:52,774 --> 00:46:56,608
You know, feelings.

387
00:46:59,238 --> 00:47:03,834
Look, man, I ain't got your sick fuckin'...
Disease? Is that what it is?

388
00:47:03,869 --> 00:47:06,273
Whatever the fuck it is,
I ain't got it.

389
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:09,507
So if you ever touch
my daughter, I'll kill you.

390
00:47:34,406 --> 00:47:36,704
When I say the word "girl"...

391
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:40,452
what is the earliest image
you can remember?

392
00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:43,786
When I say the word "pretty,"
when I say the word "pleasure"...

393
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,955
who do you see?

394
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:55,926
I see my sister.

395
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:59,457
Where is she?

396
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:04,797
She's asleep in my bedroom.

397
00:48:04,832 --> 00:48:07,297
Where are you?

398
00:48:07,332 --> 00:48:09,763
I'm in my bed too.

399
00:48:14,439 --> 00:48:16,737
How old are you and your sister?

400
00:48:18,054 --> 00:48:21,854
Oh, about six.

401
00:48:22,758 --> 00:48:25,318
That would make her four.

402
00:48:27,558 --> 00:48:30,764
What are you doing?

403
00:48:30,799 --> 00:48:33,926
Nothin'. Takin' a nap.

404
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:37,054
- A nap?
- Yeah, a nap.

405
00:48:37,062 --> 00:48:39,587
Kids take naps.
You ever take a nap, Rosen?

406
00:48:39,622 --> 00:48:43,217
I don't wanna talk about this.
What the hell are you doin' back there?

407
00:48:43,252 --> 00:48:45,404
Did you and your sister
often take naps...

408
00:48:45,414 --> 00:48:47,712
I want you back in your chair. Now!

409
00:48:50,182 --> 00:48:51,774
I'm sorry.

410
00:48:51,814 --> 00:48:54,146
I don't like nobody behind my back.

411
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:01,126
Walter, what did you do
while taking naps with your sister?

412
00:49:03,302 --> 00:49:04,769
Nothin'.

413
00:49:04,806 --> 00:49:07,820
Did you touch her?
Did you take her clothes off?

414
00:49:07,855 --> 00:49:10,835
- You take your clothes off?
- This is bullshit.

415
00:49:10,886 --> 00:49:12,945
I'm only asking questions.

416
00:49:17,414 --> 00:49:20,713
All right. I'm gonna tell you
just to shut you up.

417
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:26,197
I smelled her hair.

418
00:49:27,558 --> 00:49:29,774
What else?

419
00:49:29,809 --> 00:49:31,990
Nothin'.

420
00:49:32,006 --> 00:49:33,473
That's it.

421
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:37,418
I just liked smellin' her hair.

422
00:49:38,694 --> 00:49:40,662
You felt pleasure?

423
00:49:44,486 --> 00:49:45,953
Yes.

424
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:50,559
- Did you get an erection?
- I was six years old.

425
00:49:50,594 --> 00:49:53,992
I meant later,
when you two took naps...

426
00:49:55,974 --> 00:49:57,942
when the two of you
held each other...

427
00:49:57,958 --> 00:50:01,587
when you were 10 or 11,
and she was eight or nine...

428
00:50:03,558 --> 00:50:06,674
when the two of you
were all alone...

429
00:50:06,709 --> 00:50:09,791
completely alone in that big house.

430
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:15,123
It was a small house.

431
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:19,839
All right. A small house...

432
00:50:19,874 --> 00:50:22,112
with small rooms.

433
00:50:31,494 --> 00:50:33,587
I smelled her hair.

434
00:50:35,078 --> 00:50:36,477
That's all.

435
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:42,662
I just liked smellin' her hair.

436
00:54:04,389 --> 00:54:05,856
Hi.

437
00:54:06,694 --> 00:54:08,662
Hello.

438
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:10,977
What are you looking at?

439
00:54:12,294 --> 00:54:14,524
Up in that oak tree
there's a nest.

440
00:54:14,534 --> 00:54:16,866
- Where?
- Up there.

441
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:20,991
- A little higher.
- There are little chicks.

442
00:54:21,026 --> 00:54:23,934
- You want to see?
- Sure.

443
00:54:28,006 --> 00:54:30,434
They're starlings.

444
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:33,379
- Is that right?
- I don't like starlings.

445
00:54:33,414 --> 00:54:36,975
- Why not?
- They're extremely aggressive birds.

446
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:39,197
Plus their habits are pretty filthy.

447
00:54:39,974 --> 00:54:42,465
The mother must have her hands full.

448
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:44,938
So, you always carry these with you?

449
00:54:44,973 --> 00:54:46,902
When I go bird-watching.

450
00:54:46,918 --> 00:54:48,886
It's why I like coming here.

451
00:54:48,901 --> 00:54:50,801
It's just a city park.

452
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:53,790
You'd be surprised
how many kinds of birds you find here.

453
00:54:53,825 --> 00:54:55,893
Last week, I saw a purple martin...

454
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:58,606
and the week before that,
I saw a solitary vireo.

455
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:02,019
- That's rare.
- A solitary vireo?

456
00:55:02,054 --> 00:55:05,546
- I like that.
- Their sound is really musical.

457
00:55:07,557 --> 00:55:10,082
Are you a bird-watcher too?

458
00:55:10,086 --> 00:55:12,770
Me? No, I'm a...

459
00:55:12,805 --> 00:55:14,773
more of a people-watcher.

460
00:55:15,974 --> 00:55:18,204
The way you were staring
at the tops of those trees...

461
00:55:18,213 --> 00:55:20,113
I thought you were
gonna take off and fly.

462
00:55:20,997 --> 00:55:22,794
I should go now.

463
00:55:22,822 --> 00:55:24,221
You come here a lot?

464
00:55:24,262 --> 00:55:26,127
My daddy likes me home
before dark.

465
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:30,422
- Well, it's good to listen to your dad.
- Bye.

466
00:55:48,581 --> 00:55:51,812
Good morning, fellow sports fans.
The match is about to begin.

467
00:55:51,847 --> 00:55:54,146
Candy enters the arena
looking sweet and trim.

468
00:55:54,181 --> 00:55:58,515
He checks out the scene but plays it cool.
He's definitely holding back.

469
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:01,059
Uh-oh. Candy's eyes
have locked on to something.

470
00:56:01,094 --> 00:56:04,643
Oh, yeah. A cherub lad has separated
himself from his friends.

471
00:56:04,678 --> 00:56:09,115
Candy quickly makes his move.
He offers the boy a bag of treats.

472
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:10,529
Round one to Candy.

473
00:56:10,598 --> 00:56:13,219
The cherub walks away!

474
00:56:13,254 --> 00:56:14,881
Round two goes to the cherub.

475
00:56:14,918 --> 00:56:16,943
Very risky move by Candy.

476
00:56:16,966 --> 00:56:20,995
I have never seen Candy act so cocky.

477
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:23,396
The cherub looks at Candy.
Cherub looks for his friends.

478
00:56:24,101 --> 00:56:26,365
But his friends are long gone.
The cherub is alone.

479
00:56:26,373 --> 00:56:28,273
The cherub crosses the street-

480
00:56:36,677 --> 00:56:38,770
The cherub gets in the car.

481
00:57:24,229 --> 00:57:28,529
- Hey, Walter.
- What can I do for you, Sergeant Lucas?

482
00:57:28,564 --> 00:57:30,979
You can listen to
my stories aboutJesus.

483
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:40,591
Oh, no. This is too much.
This is too much sun.

484
00:57:40,626 --> 00:57:42,914
- What?
- This is ivy.

485
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,908
These plants don't like
a lot of sunlight.

486
00:57:44,966 --> 00:57:46,866
Don't they grow outside?

487
00:57:46,886 --> 00:57:51,323
Yeah, they grow outside.
But outside they got trees to shade 'em.

488
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:53,536
So now you're gonna take me
on a nature walk?

489
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:57,298
Have a seat.

490
00:58:02,213 --> 00:58:04,306
So, yesterday you take
the 12 bus home...

491
00:58:04,326 --> 00:58:06,954
but you don't get off
at your regular stop.

492
00:58:06,989 --> 00:58:08,918
You stay on.
Why'd you stay on?

493
00:58:08,933 --> 00:58:11,959
Fell asleep. When I woke up,
I was confused.

494
00:58:11,973 --> 00:58:14,737
I got off at the wrong stop,
and I walked home.

495
00:58:16,198 --> 00:58:17,893
You walked home?

496
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:20,737
Yeah.

497
00:58:27,845 --> 00:58:30,882
Some of these guys...

498
00:58:30,917 --> 00:58:33,442
they walk right
into a family's house.

499
00:58:33,445 --> 00:58:35,436
Very...

500
00:58:35,461 --> 00:58:38,339
It's very fuckin' ballsy.

501
00:58:38,374 --> 00:58:40,934
Had this one guy,
he's on death row...

502
00:58:40,969 --> 00:58:43,401
I'll call him Henry...

503
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:45,489
and he's tellin' me
about his last victim.

504
00:58:47,526 --> 00:58:49,756
She's a little...
little cutie named Adele.

505
00:58:49,765 --> 00:58:52,547
She's seven years old.

506
00:58:52,582 --> 00:58:57,826
And Adele's mother's got
the TV playing so loud...

507
00:58:57,861 --> 00:59:03,070
he can hear Letterman
tellin'jokes in the next room.

508
00:59:03,105 --> 00:59:05,483
And he walks into Adele's room...

509
00:59:05,518 --> 00:59:07,861
puts his hand over her mouth.

510
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:11,837
He says, "If you scream, little girl,
I'm gonna kill your mother. "

511
00:59:11,872 --> 00:59:14,683
So, of course,
Adele doesn't scream.

512
00:59:14,693 --> 00:59:18,493
She doesn't cry.
She doesn't make a sound.

513
00:59:18,528 --> 00:59:22,033
And Henry takes her by the hand.

514
00:59:23,461 --> 00:59:26,089
They walk out the front door.

515
00:59:28,517 --> 00:59:33,147
Ten days later,
they find Adele's body...

516
00:59:33,182 --> 00:59:34,528
what's left of it.

517
00:59:36,709 --> 00:59:38,677
You believe in fairy tales?

518
00:59:41,765 --> 00:59:43,665
Fairy tales?

519
00:59:43,685 --> 00:59:48,816
Yeah, like, Alice in Wonderland and...

520
00:59:50,501 --> 00:59:51,968
No.

521
00:59:52,966 --> 00:59:55,491
Yeah. Yeah, me neither.

522
00:59:57,925 --> 01:00:01,910
What's the one with the woodsman?

523
01:00:01,945 --> 01:00:05,895
- Woodsman?
- Yeah. With the ax.

524
01:00:06,725 --> 01:00:08,716
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you know it.

525
01:00:08,741 --> 01:00:11,574
The woodsman...
He cuts open a wolf s stomach.

526
01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:14,370
The little girl comes out alive.

527
01:00:14,405 --> 01:00:16,566
- Little Red Riding Hood.
- Little Red Riding Hood.

528
01:00:16,581 --> 01:00:18,776
That's it. That's it.

529
01:00:18,822 --> 01:00:22,758
The woodsman...
He cuts open the wolf s stomach.

530
01:00:22,793 --> 01:00:26,355
The girl comes out without a scratch.

531
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:39,679
You ever see a seven-year-old...

532
01:00:39,714 --> 01:00:42,281
been sodomized in half?

533
01:00:47,461 --> 01:00:49,224
She was so small...

534
01:00:51,077 --> 01:00:52,601
just broken.

535
01:00:54,661 --> 01:00:58,961
I saw 20-year vets on that job...
hard guys, man...

536
01:00:58,996 --> 01:01:01,513
and they just broke down and cried.

537
01:01:01,548 --> 01:01:04,478
I was there. I cried.

538
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:20,030
There ain't no fuckin' woodsman
in this world.

539
01:01:29,253 --> 01:01:33,553
I don't know why they keep
lettin' freaks like you out on the street.

540
01:01:33,588 --> 01:01:36,935
It just means that we gotta
catch you all over again.

541
01:01:57,093 --> 01:01:59,152
I'll see you, Walter.

542
01:02:18,886 --> 01:02:21,163
Talk to me like you fuckin'...

543
01:02:21,198 --> 01:02:23,441
Speak to me like you fuckin'...

544
01:02:24,165 --> 01:02:25,757
I am not...

545
01:02:26,758 --> 01:02:28,726
I am not...

546
01:03:21,286 --> 01:03:23,925
- Let's go.
- You don't feel sorry for this sick fuck.

547
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,565
- Mind your own business, Pedro.
- This is my business.

548
01:03:32,677 --> 01:03:35,145
What the hell is goin' on here?

549
01:03:39,653 --> 01:03:41,120
Who did this?

550
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:45,078
Any man who can't deal with it,
you meet me in the office.

551
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:47,847
I'll pay you for the week.
You can clear the fuck out.

552
01:03:47,882 --> 01:03:50,814
We got a lot of orders today.
Get to work.

553
01:03:50,849 --> 01:03:52,587
This is bullshit.

554
01:04:02,117 --> 01:04:04,210
Are you okay?

555
01:04:09,382 --> 01:04:10,849
Watch your back, bitch.

556
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:52,021
This is ready whenever.

557
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:05,077
Where's Walter?

558
01:05:05,093 --> 01:05:06,617
I don't know.

559
01:05:10,501 --> 01:05:12,093
I don't fucking believe this.

560
01:05:12,165 --> 01:05:15,225
- Goddamn it, Mary-Kay!
- Bitch, what the fuck are you doin'?

561
01:05:15,237 --> 01:05:19,037
- What is going on?
- This is bullshit, Bob!

562
01:05:19,072 --> 01:05:20,448
It's bullshit.

563
01:05:21,413 --> 01:05:23,540
People have the right to know.

564
01:07:05,925 --> 01:07:08,052
See anything interesting?

565
01:07:08,837 --> 01:07:10,304
Not yet.

566
01:07:23,045 --> 01:07:26,674
- What are you writin' in that book?
- It's my bird book.

567
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:30,087
I've identified 67 species
of birds this year alone.

568
01:07:30,122 --> 01:07:32,021
Wow.

569
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:37,166
Where are your friends?

570
01:07:39,365 --> 01:07:41,458
Don't you have any friends?

571
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:45,713
I have friends.

572
01:07:47,749 --> 01:07:49,808
A pretty girl like you
should have a lot of friends.

573
01:07:49,861 --> 01:07:51,328
I'm not pretty.

574
01:07:51,365 --> 01:07:54,357
- Well, not in the common way.
- What does that mean?

575
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:58,200
It means that uncommon beauty...

576
01:07:58,235 --> 01:08:00,081
is commonly overlooked.

577
01:08:01,252 --> 01:08:04,022
You know, like people only notice...

578
01:08:04,057 --> 01:08:06,793
the birds with the brightest colors.

579
01:08:14,373 --> 01:08:16,341
What's your name?

580
01:08:22,372 --> 01:08:25,432
Let's see. Linda.

581
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:28,594
Susan?

582
01:08:28,613 --> 01:08:30,240
Jennifer?

583
01:08:30,277 --> 01:08:32,245
Jackie?

584
01:08:34,341 --> 01:08:37,208
You tell me your name,
and I'll tell ya mine.

585
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:40,049
Robin.

586
01:08:40,069 --> 01:08:42,196
Yeah, like the bird.

587
01:08:43,205 --> 01:08:45,332
- How old are you?
- Twelve.

588
01:08:45,349 --> 01:08:47,647
- No, you're not.
- I will be in three months.

589
01:08:47,653 --> 01:08:49,712
I can't wait. I hate being 11.

590
01:08:49,733 --> 01:08:52,531
It has to be the stupidest age
in the world.

591
01:08:58,213 --> 01:08:59,680
What's your name?

592
01:09:00,869 --> 01:09:02,461
Walter.

593
01:09:02,501 --> 01:09:05,561
- Do you have many friends?
- No.

594
01:09:05,596 --> 01:09:07,509
How come?

595
01:09:07,525 --> 01:09:11,120
A long time ago, I was sent away f...

596
01:09:12,709 --> 01:09:14,609
When I came home,
all my friends were gone.

597
01:09:14,629 --> 01:09:16,756
Sounds like you were banished.

598
01:09:18,885 --> 01:09:20,978
Banished, yeah.

599
01:09:20,997 --> 01:09:23,727
Birds are my friends.
They know I watch them...

600
01:09:23,749 --> 01:09:26,217
but they don't mind
because they like being watched...

601
01:09:26,244 --> 01:09:28,712
if they know
you won't hurt them.

602
01:09:35,461 --> 01:09:37,588
- Robin...
- Yes?

603
01:09:39,237 --> 01:09:41,262
Would you like to sit on my lap?

604
01:09:42,085 --> 01:09:43,552
What?

605
01:09:44,741 --> 01:09:46,868
Would you like to sit on my lap?

606
01:09:46,885 --> 01:09:48,853
No, thank you.

607
01:09:50,533 --> 01:09:52,364
Okay.

608
01:09:52,389 --> 01:09:54,357
Doesn't matter.

609
01:10:00,261 --> 01:10:02,229
Do you want me to sit on your lap?

610
01:10:06,693 --> 01:10:08,718
Yes.

611
01:10:08,741 --> 01:10:10,834
I would enjoy that.

612
01:10:19,941 --> 01:10:22,978
I know this place that's really quiet...

613
01:10:23,013 --> 01:10:25,982
except for the sound
of these tiny little birds.

614
01:10:27,269 --> 01:10:29,650
They sound like finches.

615
01:10:29,685 --> 01:10:32,031
Yeah, they might be finches.

616
01:10:34,148 --> 01:10:36,412
Do you want to see?

617
01:10:42,725 --> 01:10:44,955
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.

618
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:48,671
- Does he?
- Yes.

619
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:50,804
Do you like it when he asks you?

620
01:10:53,413 --> 01:10:54,880
No.

621
01:11:05,413 --> 01:11:07,404
Why not?

622
01:11:16,261 --> 01:11:18,456
Are you two alone
when he asks you?

623
01:11:23,653 --> 01:11:26,622
Does he say strange things?

624
01:11:31,717 --> 01:11:34,185
Does he move his legs
in funny ways?

625
01:12:03,844 --> 01:12:05,311
Walter...

626
01:12:07,845 --> 01:12:10,143
do you still want me
to sit on your lap?

627
01:12:11,812 --> 01:12:13,609
I will.

628
01:12:13,636 --> 01:12:15,103
I don't mind.

629
01:12:17,284 --> 01:12:18,751
No.

630
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:28,051
Go home, Robin.

631
01:15:40,581 --> 01:15:42,048
Come on in. It's open.

632
01:15:43,717 --> 01:15:45,480
Hey, Walter.

633
01:15:47,684 --> 01:15:49,709
What can I do for you,
Sergeant Lucas?

634
01:15:50,404 --> 01:15:52,304
I don't know. We'll see.

635
01:15:52,324 --> 01:15:56,962
You didn't hear? Last night...

636
01:15:56,997 --> 01:16:00,262
all that shoutin'
and screamin' outside?

637
01:16:01,764 --> 01:16:03,231
No.

638
01:16:03,269 --> 01:16:06,568
Yeah, a guy got beat up
pretty bad last night out there.

639
01:16:06,603 --> 01:16:08,432
- You don't know anything about this?
- Nope.

640
01:16:08,452 --> 01:16:09,942
I could take ya downtown.

641
01:16:11,716 --> 01:16:13,183
Yeah, you could...

642
01:16:14,404 --> 01:16:16,497
but it'd be a waste of your time.

643
01:16:16,516 --> 01:16:21,476
There was a boy there.
He could I.D. The assailant.

644
01:16:21,511 --> 01:16:23,541
He gave a description.

645
01:16:23,588 --> 01:16:26,056
It fits you really, really close.

646
01:16:30,788 --> 01:16:32,312
That's a nasty scratch
on your neck.

647
01:16:34,628 --> 01:16:36,357
I got a passionate girlfriend.

648
01:16:41,605 --> 01:16:43,573
What's with the boxes?

649
01:16:43,589 --> 01:16:45,216
I'm movin' in with her.

650
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:51,048
Congrats. Lucky you.

651
01:16:51,877 --> 01:16:53,868
I count my blessings.

652
01:16:53,924 --> 01:16:56,017
Yeah, I bet you do.

653
01:16:59,716 --> 01:17:01,809
Well, all right.

654
01:17:02,981 --> 01:17:05,711
I'll be seein' you around, Walter.

655
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:11,578
Hey.

656
01:17:13,668 --> 01:17:15,898
You think you're gonna
catch this guy?

657
01:17:15,908 --> 01:17:18,337
Yeah. Yeah.

658
01:17:18,372 --> 01:17:20,101
We're gonna catch him.

659
01:17:21,508 --> 01:17:24,102
But the victim can't talk.

660
01:17:24,772 --> 01:17:28,003
Among all his other injuries,
he's got a broken jaw.

661
01:17:28,038 --> 01:17:30,270
However, we did run
a check on the victim...

662
01:17:30,277 --> 01:17:32,575
and as it turns out
he's wanted in Virginia.

663
01:17:33,572 --> 01:17:35,665
Raped a boy down there.

664
01:17:47,684 --> 01:17:50,653
You stay out of trouble, Walter.
I'm watchin' you.

665
01:19:15,365 --> 01:19:17,333
I saw my sister.

666
01:19:18,308 --> 01:19:20,276
It was hard.

667
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:24,740
She's still really hurt and angry.

668
01:19:27,493 --> 01:19:30,121
I understand that. I do.

669
01:19:39,684 --> 01:19:42,152
It's gonna take time, Walter.

670
01:19:43,684 --> 01:19:45,151
Time?

671
01:19:47,844 --> 01:19:50,142
How do you feel about that?

672
01:19:52,196 --> 01:19:53,663
I feel...

673
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:57,247
okay.
