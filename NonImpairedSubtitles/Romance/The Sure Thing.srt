1
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,533
Consider outer space.

2
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:22,798
From the time of the first NASA mission,
it became evident...

3
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:26,676
that being in space has a profound effect
on the human psyche.

4
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:30,204
During the first Gemini mission,
some thought was actually given...

5
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,650
to the notion of sending up
a man and a woman together.

6
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,047
Really?

7
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,582
A cosmic Adam and Eve, if you will...

8
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,760
bound together
in a sophisticated nerve center...

9
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,422
at the head of the largest,
most powerful known rocket...

10
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,466
its giant thrusters
blasting into the dark void...

11
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,469
as they hurtled towards
their final destination:

12
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,630
the gushing wellspring of life itself.

13
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,806
How would you like
a sexual encounter so intense...

14
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:59,344
it could conceivably change
your political views?

15
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,842
-Would you like to dance?
-Yes, please.

16
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,751
I'll take that as a no.

17
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,893
-Consider outer space.
-What?

18
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,802
Private Gibson! Incoming!

19
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,581
What is this? "Lonely man sitting on a hill"?

20
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,515
It's over, Lance.

21
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,791
It's gone, I've lost it.

22
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,525
High school.

23
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,156
I started off so hot.
Sophomore year, two times.

24
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,493
Junior year was excellent. Four times.

25
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,133
And not all with the same girl.

26
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:03,074
Senior year looked like the best.
The first day of classes, then nothing.

27
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,007
What do you mean,
nothing your senior year?

28
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,276
What about that time with Barbara DeVillebis
in the high-jump pit?

29
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,816
That was you.

30
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,014
I just can't motivate myself
the way I used to.

31
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,260
Maybe I'm past my prime.

32
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,864
It's not you.
It's these high school girls, here.

33
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,423
They're simple.

34
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:32,502
They're never gonna stimulate
a complex guy like you.

35
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,935
-Maybe you're right.
-Of course I'm right.

36
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,203
Anyways...

37
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:41,814
after tonight, you'll never have to deal with
these simple high school girls again.

38
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:47,481
-But won't these same girls be in college?
-Yeah, but it'll be different.

39
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,249
-Why?
-Because they'll be college girls.

40
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,853
I'm gonna miss you.

41
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:59,625
It's your own fault. You could be
coming out to California with me.

42
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,927
Yeah, right.

43
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,798
Get a totally bitchin' education
out there, dude.

44
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,535
California.

45
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,505
You could be coming
to New England with me.

46
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,407
What are you, crazy? The lvy League stinks.

47
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,246
They've only got those ugly,
intellectual girls...

48
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,011
with Band-Aids on their knees
from playing the cello. No, thank you.

49
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,242
I'm really gonna miss you.

50
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,885
We're college men now.

51
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,902
Dear Lance, the campus here is beautiful.

52
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,830
I've never seen so much corduroy
in one place.

53
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,538
Classes are classes.

54
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,142
One of them even looks like
it might be interesting.

55
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,411
You never know.

56
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:54,842
You're wrong about the women here.
I haven't seen one Band-Aid.

57
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,048
In fact, there's plenty of action.

58
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,648
My roommate and I have an understanding.

59
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:03,495
Hope things are going as good for you.
Your pal, Gib.

60
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,131
P.S. All of the above is bullshit.

61
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,966
I'm floundering in a sea of confusion
and total despair.

62
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,733
But, knock on wood, I still have my health.

63
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:17,205
This week's assignment
is to rewrite last week's assignment.

64
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,708
Remember, "As the dog returneth
to his own vomit...

65
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,713
"so does the fool to his folly."

66
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,349
Sorry I'm late,
but there was this big problem...

67
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,090
and I'm late because of it.

68
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:38,491
Katherine, when I told you
that you should develop your own style...

69
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:42,330
I didn't mean that you should dot the i's
with little flowers.

70
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,031
And this lavender ink....
Would you lose that?

71
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,001
It strains the eye.

72
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,198
You sure take a lot of notes.

73
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,839
Miss Duran, this is very interesting.

74
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:01,180
Ordinarily, the conclusion comes
in the end of the paper, but....

75
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,419
-I like that.
-Thank you.

76
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,649
Go on.

77
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,447
Gibson.

78
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,466
-Mr. Gibson?
-Yes, what?

79
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:19,862
I know what an important part
voyeurism plays in your daily life...

80
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,840
but would you mind
if I take up a moment of your time?

81
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,470
-Sure.
-Thank you.

82
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,803
See, I want to tell you...

83
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,081
that I really enjoyed your paper.

84
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,207
-You did?
-Yeah.

85
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,684
I don't remember the last time...

86
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:37,655
that I have seen this much detail
expressed on:

87
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:41,823
"How to eat pizza
without burning the roof of your mouth."

88
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,597
Unfortunately, whatever whimsical qualities
that your paper evokes...

89
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:53,967
are obscured in a morass
of marginal grammar...

90
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,070
creative spelling...

91
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,108
and, as I believe, sausage stain.

92
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,876
Pepperoni.

93
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,510
Clean it up.

94
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:05,940
Ms. Bradbury.

95
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,286
You, on the other hand...

96
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:12,188
express your ideas very clearly.

97
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,989
Thank you.

98
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,722
Except that your paper is....

99
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,920
Well, it's dry.

100
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,430
There's not enough of you coming through.

101
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,593
Loosen up, Alison. Have some fun.

102
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:29,206
Sleep when you feel like it,
not when you think you should.

103
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:32,301
Eat food that is bad for you,
at least once in a while.

104
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:37,079
Have conversations with people
whose clothes are not color coordinated.

105
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,147
Make love in a hammock!

106
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,252
Life is the ultimate experience.

107
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,292
You have to experience it...

108
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,456
in order to write about it.

109
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,825
-Yes, Alison.
-What did you say after "hammock"?

110
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,135
-I want you.
-All right.

111
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,800
You're a dead man, dead meat.
You'll hear footsteps.

112
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,933
Set!

113
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,279
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand, three, one thousand.

114
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:16,087
Gibson, all-pro safety out of Grambling,
makes another sparkling defensive jam.

115
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,148
-I thought Grambling was all black.
-So what?

116
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,716
What are you doing tonight?

117
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:25,423
I'll tell you, I am not rewriting
my English paper. I have a social life.

118
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,592
That's right, I forgot.
You've got to go to a mixer.

119
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,862
Stand in the corner for three hours,
and not ask anyone to dance.

120
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,735
It's the girls at this school.

121
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,798
All they want is to stay indoors, smoke
cigarettes and relate. I don't like them.

122
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,004
Why do you have to like them?

123
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,107
You're dead meat.

124
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,313
What does Taub mean, I have to live life?

125
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:51,015
In high school, I was delegate
to the mock UN in New York City.

126
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,383
Twice.

127
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,122
When I was nine,
I broke my brother's nose, boxing.

128
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,960
On a tour of Graceland,
I passed out in Elvis' bedroom.

129
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,327
I think I've done my share of living,
haven't l?

130
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,531
-What do you think of that guy Gib?
-I don't.

131
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,001
I think he's got a cute ass.

132
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,276
-Him?
-Yeah.

133
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:18,150
Gibson, with the interception!
And he's got some running room!

134
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,208
He's to the 30, to the 40...

135
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:24,245
and he's run out of bounds at midfield
by Jimbo Maccavechi!

136
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,688
That's Gibson's 9th interception
of this very young season.

137
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,092
He's having an outstanding year.

138
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,061
"Life's the ultimate experience."

139
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,663
Forget it. She likes the intellectual type.

140
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,637
I'm intellectual, and stuff.

141
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:43,072
You're flunking English.
That's your mother tongue, and stuff.

142
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,442
The only way she'd go out with you
is out of pity.

143
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:50,106
-Mastin, you're a genius.
-Stop and go, on 1.

144
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,246
Break!

145
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,616
-Both y'all are dead.
-Ready down. Set.

146
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,420
-Hut one. Hut two. Hut three.
-Watch it, now.

147
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,519
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand, three, one thousand.

148
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,624
-Nice D.
-Go!

149
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,495
Nice.

150
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,063
-Where are you going?
-Come on!

151
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,336
The ball!

152
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:34,115
I'm flunking English. I was wondering
if maybe you could help me out.

153
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,417
Nice swimsuit.

154
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,562
If I flunk English, I'm out of here.

155
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,930
Kiss college goodbye.

156
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,097
I don't know what I'll do.

157
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,705
I'll probably go home.

158
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:55,311
Gee, Dad will be pissed off.
Mom will be heartbroken.

159
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:59,912
If I play my cards right,
I get maybe a six-month's grace period...

160
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:03,751
and then I got to get a job,
and you know what that means.

161
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,359
That's right. They start me off
at the drive-up window...

162
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,623
and I work my way up
from shakes to burgers...

163
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,858
and then, one day, my lucky break comes.

164
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,164
The French fry guy dies,
and they offer me the job.

165
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,865
But the day I have to start, some men
come in a black Lincoln Continental...

166
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,536
and tell me I can make a quick $300
just for driving a van back from Mexico.

167
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:30,173
When I get out of jail, I'm 36 years old...

168
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,746
Iiving in a flophouse. No job...

169
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,319
no home, no upward mobility,
very few teeth.

170
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,957
Then one day they find me, face down...

171
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:43,893
talking to the gutter, clutching
a bottle of paint thinner. And why?

172
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,887
Because you wouldn't help me
in English. No!

173
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,059
You were too busy to help me!

174
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,063
Too busy to help a drowning man!

175
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,153
Okay.

176
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,788
-Okay, what?
-Okay, I'll help you.

177
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,729
You will?

178
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,495
When?

179
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,867
How about tonight?

180
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,372
Let's see. Friday.

181
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,183
5:30, dinner. 6:00, calculus.

182
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,451
7:00, news. 7:30, shower.

183
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,519
7:45, phone call. 8:00?

184
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,624
8:00, I don't know.
That's when I rearrange my sock drawer.

185
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,423
-Do you want me to help you, or not?
-I do.

186
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,224
I was just kidding, there.

187
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,896
-8:00.
-Okay.

188
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,774
See you then.

189
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,043
-Where?
-McKenzie Hall.

190
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:07,872
Great!

191
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,351
It's Friday night!

192
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,294
"I'm a freshman
at a small Northeastern college.

193
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,698
"l never thought those letters were true,
until a few days ago...

194
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,537
"l had an experience that changed my mind.

195
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,441
"l just had to share it with you.

196
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:42,742
"l had resigned myself
to another night of reading your magazine...

197
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,716
"when there was a knock
on my dorm room door.

198
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:49,515
"And when I opened the door,
I could hardly believe my eyes.

199
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,222
"There were two of the foxiest twins
I had ever seen...

200
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,358
"with long brunette hair,
legs that wouldn't quit...

201
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,922
"and firm tits."

202
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,695
How does that sound?

203
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,206
Change "tits" to "generous scoops
of mouthwatering flesh."

204
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,866
And have them defy gravity.

205
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,307
Is this shirt good?

206
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,640
Yeah. You think they'll know that
"scoops of flesh" means "tits"?

207
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,908
I don't think it sounds specific enough.

208
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:19,314
Where else are you gonna find
scoops of flesh?

209
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,353
How's this for an opening line:

210
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,786
"Did you know that
Nietzsche died of syphilis?"

211
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,848
-How do you spell "zucchini"?
-Z-u-c-h-i-n-i.

212
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,185
Nietzsche's too obscure.

213
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,890
How about, "Did you know
that Shakespeare died of syphilis?"

214
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,890
She probably knows it isn't true.
I don't know what to say.

215
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,302
It's not what you say that counts,
but how you say it.

216
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,364
-Use sincerity. It's the best technique.
-What?

217
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,175
Come here.

218
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,548
You know, I've never met
anyone like you before.

219
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:04,317
Usually, when I meet someone new,
I feel awkward and shy.

220
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,990
But with you, it's different.

221
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,994
I can talk to you.

222
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:14,704
You know what I'm thinking, without my
having to explain it to you in fancy terms.

223
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,105
We speak each other's unspoken language...

224
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:20,707
fluently.

225
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,646
I love you.

226
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:30,618
That is the most enormous pile of horseshit
I've ever heard in my life.

227
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,587
-Get out of here, you piece of slime.
-No chick would ever buy it.

228
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,652
That's where you're wrong.
It's how I got Lucy.

229
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,958
-It's horseshit.
-Effective horseshit.

230
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,397
Get a life.

231
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,704
It's true.

232
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,295
It's open.

233
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:27,608
I'm so far behind, I haven't even picked out
a theme for my English Lit term paper.

234
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:30,711
Of course I'm still coming out there
for Christmas.

235
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:34,617
You think I'm gonna leave you alone
with all those UCLA girls?

236
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:38,747
I just can't afford to fly.
My parents will only pay if I go to see them.

237
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,520
Don't worry. I'll figure something out.

238
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,926
They have this bulletin board
where they list rides.

239
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,192
I really want to see you.

240
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,974
I will send you the article
on civil liability, I promise.

241
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,534
Jason?

242
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:05,212
Do you ever eat food
that you think is bad for you?

243
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,383
I didn't think so. It's not important.

244
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,818
You tell me first.

245
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,987
I love you, too.

246
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,295
'Bye.

247
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,806
-Who's that, your lawyer?
-Someday.

248
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,811
-Ready?
-Yeah.

249
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,686
"When I recollect
my most truly excellent experience...

250
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,488
"recurrent images buzz through my brain:

251
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:54,356
"the big bubbles of crust
that expand right up through the sauce...

252
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:58,597
"glistening pools of oil
as still and inviting as a mountain...

253
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,233
"lake...

254
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,635
"the ropy knots of cheese
that gather to a chewy perfection...

255
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,738
"in the center as the slices are pulled apart."

256
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,883
-It's good.
-This is all wrong.

257
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,943
There's no punctuation.
It's all one sentence.

258
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,389
-So?
-It's a mess.

259
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,719
You neglected to mention
the most important thing.

260
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,159
I talk about the cheese-to-sauce ratio
right there.

261
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:28,029
You didn't state your topic,
that this is gonna be a paper on pizza.

262
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,699
But that is completely inferred.

263
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,263
-lmplied.
-Whatever.

264
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,773
Look, what do you say we blow this off
and go exploring?

265
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,139
Nothing gets done on a Friday night.
Come on.

266
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,677
Where are you going?

267
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,938
It's too stuffy, let's go get some air.

268
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:51,113
-You can't go in there.
-I can.

269
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,624
This is America, you can go anywhere.

270
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,480
-We're not supposed to be up here.
-See that?

271
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,882
That's Ursa Major, the Big Bear.

272
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,685
-We could get into trouble.
-That's Ursa Minor, the Little Bear.

273
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,554
Up to the north there, that's Cassiopeia.

274
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,787
That's Cassiopeia?

275
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,554
-She was the mother of Andromeda, right?
-Who?

276
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,267
-Cassiopeia.
-Really? I just know the names.

277
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,436
Andromeda's there, too, next to Cassiopeia.

278
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:44,435
Andromeda. She was the princess
who was chained to a rock.

279
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,370
She was to be sacrificed to a sea serpent.

280
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,209
-Did he get her?
-No.

281
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:53,043
-Perseus rescued her at the last minute.
-Perseus, good man.

282
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,712
He's up there, too, next to Andromeda.

283
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,283
-You know a lot about astronomy.
-Yeah.

284
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:03,119
When I was six, I wanted to be an astronaut.

285
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,789
You know, all the Tang you can drink.

286
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,602
You'll never believe what I wanted to be
when I was six.

287
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,694
-A classics professor.
-No.

288
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,598
I wanted to be a princess.

289
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,720
You know, Alison,
I never met anyone like you before.

290
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:36,718
Usually, when I meet someone new,
I feel awkward and shy.

291
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:40,598
But with you it's different.
I feel I can talk to you.

292
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:46,334
You know what I'm thinking, without me
having to explain it to you in fancy terms.

293
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:49,135
We speak each other's unspoken language...

294
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,966
-What?
-...fluently.

295
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,209
I love you.

296
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,305
What?

297
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,112
-Did I hurt you?
-No.

298
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:01,878
I'm sorry!

299
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,888
You're not.
You had this whole thing planned.

300
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,922
Excellent.

301
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,925
-What?
-Don't you have an 8:00?

302
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,969
-What time is it?
-7:51.

303
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:20,797
Shit!

304
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:24,703
Oh, God!

305
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:50,696
Wait up.

306
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:57,400
I feel really terrible about Friday night.

307
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,702
I was rude, insensitive, selfish....

308
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,439
-Asshole.
-Exactly.

309
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,705
But that wasn't me.

310
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:09,117
I don't know why I said those things,
I'm really not like that. Please.

311
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,849
I'm really sorry.

312
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,587
Can you forgive me?

313
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,054
Please.

314
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,893
Come on, we're gonna be late for class.

315
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,132
"He was a man, that's all.

316
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,368
"A man like any other man.

317
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,774
"A man like no other man."

318
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,276
-That's very interesting, Marsha.
-Thanks.

319
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,315
You have a feel for ambiguity.

320
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,618
Anyone else want to volunteer?

321
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,991
-Me?
-Give me your paper.

322
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,231
Here you go.

323
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:00,061
-No pepperoni today?
-It's clean.

324
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:05,400
"l am a freshman
at a small Northeastern college.

325
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:08,077
"l never thought these letters were real...

326
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:11,377
"until a few days ago, when I had
an experience that changed my mind.

327
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,315
"l just had to share it with you."

328
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:16,354
-Miss Taub, I don't think that you--
-Take it easy.

329
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:21,455
"l am 6'2", with dark hair...

330
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:25,553
"athletic build from football, and I'm
considered good-looking by my friends.

331
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,860
"I'm not boastful, but I must explain...

332
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:31,096
"for the sake of clarity,
that I am relatively well equipped...

333
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,661
"with 10 inches of solid man-meat.

334
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:45,174
"Still, it has been a dry season
as far as girls were concerned."

335
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,526
I'll get it.

336
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:07,300
-It's for you, Gib. Long distance.
-Thanks.

337
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,133
I'm coming.

338
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,279
Buddy, you getting any?

339
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:20,911
I'm talking to you cordless.
What are you doing for Christmas break?

340
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,620
I do. You're coming to California.

341
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:25,650
What don't you know?

342
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,557
My roommate's got a convertible.
We cruise to Palm Springs.

343
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,022
I got exams after Christmas.

344
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:35,526
We are talking SoCal, here.
It's 80 degrees outside.

345
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,099
My roommate's got this beach house
in Malibu.

346
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,099
I can't afford the flight.

347
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:43,232
Listen. Can you hear that?

348
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,538
Hear that?
Those are waves calling out to you.

349
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,272
They're beckoning.

350
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,741
-"Come to California."
-It's too sunny out there.

351
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,818
There's a certain someone
I want you to meet.

352
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,876
Forget it.

353
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,587
She's a very special person.

354
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,751
I can't deal with striking out on both coasts.

355
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,961
You're not gonna strike out.

356
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:07,590
She was released from parochial school.
She's in her experimental phase.

357
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,360
Will you forget it?

358
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,567
-She loves sex.
-What does she look like?

359
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,904
You remember that last snapshot
I sent you?

360
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,534
The blonde in the string bikini? Get it.

361
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:22,941
-I can't right now.
-That's an order, Private Gibson.

362
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,751
Excuse me.

363
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,459
That's new.

364
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,423
-Yeah.
-You got it?

365
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,762
-Yeah.
-Good. Now look at it.

366
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,131
Fixate on it.

367
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,833
-Are you fixating on it?
-I'm fixating.

368
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,201
-Are you sitting down?
-Yes.

369
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,073
She's a sure thing.

370
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,913
A sure thing.

371
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:00,842
I don't need to explain
the deep significance of those words.

372
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,649
I told her all about you,
and she's dying to meet you.

373
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:06,657
But you gotta drag your ass out here
by the 22nd...

374
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,523
because she's leaving the next day
for a semester at sea.

375
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,619
So, think you can make it?

376
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,358
-Are you Gib?
-Yeah.

377
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,164
Hi, welcome aboard.

378
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:22,035
-I'm Mary Ann Webster.
-And I'm Gary Cooper.

379
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,764
But not the Gary Cooper that's dead.

380
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,637
Hop in.

381
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,545
-Alison, this is Gib.
-And Gib, this is Alison.

382
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:39,120
I knew I should've taken the bus.

383
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,387
What, and wind up
sitting next to some sleazebag?

384
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,324
Some sleazebag you don't know?

385
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,331
-You two know each other.
-We're old friends.

386
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,432
We're not old friends. We're acquaintances.

387
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,397
Very distant acquaintances.

388
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,769
Kids, come on.
Let's make this a fun trip, okay?

389
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,832
-You guys know any show tunes?
-That's a great idea.

390
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:02,676
When the moon is in the Seventh House

391
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:06,308
And Jupiter aligns with Mars

392
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:10,252
Then peace will guide the planets

393
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:13,256
And love will steer the stars

394
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:17,727
This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius

395
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:21,693
The age of Aquarius!

396
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:28,071
Button up your overcoat
when the wind is free

397
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:31,666
Take good care of yourself
you belong to me!

398
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,138
Come on, everybody.

399
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:37,910
Eat an apple every day, get to bed by 3:00

400
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,212
Take good care of yourself
you belong to me!

401
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,446
Do the "ooh-ooh's."

402
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,351
Be careful crossing streets

403
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,282
Don't eat meats

404
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,217
Cut out sweets

405
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,997
You'll get a pain and ruin your tum-tum

406
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:03,571
I never met anyone like you before.
Usually, when I meet someone new...

407
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,270
I feel awkward and shy.

408
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,569
But with you it's different.

409
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,705
I feel I can talk to you.

410
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:16,346
You know what I'm thinking, without me
having to explain it to you in fancy terms.

411
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:19,748
We speak each other's
unspoken language fluently.

412
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,626
Before you go any further, let's be honest.

413
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,289
You want it. I want it.

414
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:32,764
You know I want it.
You don't have to bullshit me to get it.

415
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:37,232
And even if you do bullshit me,
you still get it.

416
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:43,138
Wear your flannel underwear
when you climb a tree

417
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:46,706
Take good care of yourself,
you belong to me

418
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:50,620
Honey, what's the matter?
You're not singing.

419
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:53,290
I'm not gonna sing
if they're not gonna join in.

420
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:56,521
-Come on, honey--
-No, they're ruining it for everyone.

421
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,586
What do you think you're doing?

422
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,658
-I'm going to bed.
-Not with me, you're not.

423
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,787
I'm not going to bed with you.

424
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:34,389
I'm going to bed
in a bed that you happen to be in, also.

425
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,063
I won't try anything, I swear.

426
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:38,864
Trust me.

427
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:43,101
You are sleeping on the floor.
I worked out a schedule.

428
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,301
-It's not my schedule.
-It's both of ours.

429
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,539
They never shut up.
What does she see in him?

430
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,912
It's a twisted relationship.

431
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,880
-You want to sleep in the bed?
-I do.

432
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,548
Fine, I'll sleep on the floor.

433
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:01,250
You don't have to sleep on the floor.

434
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,357
-Do you intend to sleep in the bed?
-I do.

435
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,954
Then I intend to sleep on the floor.

436
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:13,501
Good night.

437
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:03,815
-Great breakfast.
-Protein, good for you.

438
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:10,316
Cheese balls, anyone? Gary? They're good.

439
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,392
-Cheese balls?
-No, thank you.

440
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,277
You would think that was funny.

441
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,745
As a matter of fact, I think that's hysterical.

442
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:39,754
I think it's a scream. An absolute laugh riot.

443
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,687
-What the hell's the matter with it?
-It's stupid.

444
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,423
Everything's stupid with you.

445
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:49,955
All right. It is stupid. What's wrong
with being stupid once in a while?

446
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,901
Does everything you do
always have to be sensible?

447
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,700
Gary, they're at it again.

448
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:57,935
Haven't you ever thrown water balloons
off the roof?

449
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,704
Didn't you ever sprinkle lvory Flakes
on the floor...

450
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,769
because you wanted it to snow in July?

451
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:07,375
Didn't you ever get really shitfaced,
and make a complete fool out of yourself...

452
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:10,216
and still have an excellent time?

453
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:11,820
Gary, do something.

454
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:15,222
Don't you feel great when
you do something totally spontaneous?

455
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,056
Something totally off the wall?

456
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,858
Spontaneity has its time and its place.

457
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,667
Alison, do you know what you are?

458
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,361
-You're repressed.
-I'm not repressed.

459
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:29,167
You are.

460
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,504
-I can be as spontaneous as anyone.
-Prove it.

461
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:32,770
What do you want me to do?

462
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,143
-I don't have to prove anything to you.
-You can't. You're repressed.

463
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,239
You don't have to be stupid
to be spontaneous.

464
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,908
-Repressed.
-ls that spontaneous?

465
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:42,214
-Sticking your butt out of a car?
-Repressed!

466
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:43,844
Face it, you're repressed.

467
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,183
You want spontaneity?

468
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,417
-I'll give you spontaneity!
-Repressed!

469
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,550
I'll give you.... Watch this!

470
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,694
You guys!

471
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,560
What in Sam Hill?

472
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,531
Twist and shout!

473
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,602
Come to mama, boys!

474
00:33:58,669 --> 00:33:59,931
Oh, dang!

475
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,303
I'm getting a hive.

476
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:10,740
"lndecent exposure."
"Driving so as to endanger."

477
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,151
"Driving with a load
not properly tied down."

478
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:23,225
-Here.
-Thank you, Officer. I'm very sorry.

479
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:46,011
What the hell are you doing?

480
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:50,518
-Lock the doors.
-Let's be reasonable, Gary!

481
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,182
You can't do this! You can't leave us here!

482
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:56,121
You can't. Gary, please!

483
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:59,425
-I'm pleading.
-Lock the doors!

484
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,699
I'll do anything!

485
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,531
I'll sing show tunes!

486
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,668
Feelings, nothing more than feelings

487
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,899
Trying to forget my feelings

488
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,904
Feelings of love!

489
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,055
They'll be back.

490
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,065
Just a little mad.

491
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,942
There's a town up ahead.
I saw a sign. We can hitch.

492
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,708
Where you going?

493
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:59,214
We're in the middle of nowhere, cold,
there's no cars! You stay and hitch.

494
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:03,056
-You gonna walk? It's almost 20 miles.
-And don't follow me!

495
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,074
Fried pork rinds, anyone?

496
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,559
This doesn't change anything, okay?

497
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,928
Suit yourself.

498
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:18,226
You know, junk food really doesn't deserve
the bad rap it gets.

499
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,389
Take these fried pork rinds.

500
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,763
This particular brand
has one percent of the RDA...

501
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:26,860
that's "recommended daily allowance,"
of riboflavin.

502
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,337
You ever noticed
there's three kinds of junk food?

503
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,740
There's your starchy, fried, greasy type--

504
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:36,040
Listen, I appreciate the food.
But I'm not in the mood...

505
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:39,207
to listen to any more
of your scientific observations.

506
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,249
You didn't have to come over here
and sit down.

507
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:44,318
You're right. I didn't.

508
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:01,937
Want a ride?

509
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,837
I wouldn't take that ride, if I were you.

510
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:07,968
You're not me.

511
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:13,605
Hello!

512
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,812
-How far are you going?
-Los Angeles.

513
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:20,721
Los Angeles is a long way
for a little girl like you to be going.

514
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:25,492
This thing's like an old woman.
You've got to kick her to get her in gear.

515
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,267
I got up at 6:00 this morning,
and I've been driving ever since.

516
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,309
You're the first person I've talked to all day.

517
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,901
Wish I could say that.

518
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:45,278
I hope he gets a ride, but some people
just don't know when to put a lid on it.

519
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:49,615
A day like this, you get to thinking
you're the only person on Earth.

520
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,814
It gets lonely on the road.

521
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,583
I know. I can't wait to get to California
to see my boyfriend.

522
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,187
I got my CB. But that's not real talk.

523
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,595
-It's not a real person, just a voice.
-Let's see if l--

524
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,932
You never get to know what they look like,
or who they are.

525
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:10,440
...by Thursday night,
or Friday morning at the latest.

526
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,598
You look nice.

527
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,938
Why are we stopping here?

528
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,179
What are we doing?

529
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:25,080
It gets lonely on the road.

530
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,457
-Don't touch me!
-Don't be scared.

531
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:33,229
-I wouldn't hurt you.
-Don't!

532
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,467
Thanks for the ride.
I've been out here all day.

533
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,300
Am I interrupting anything?

534
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,840
Me and the wife
are just having a little squabble.

535
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,035
It's not easy getting rides, you know?

536
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,601
Most people are afraid
to pick up hitchhikers.

537
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,772
You never know who you might pick up.

538
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:54,011
I mean, I could be some crazed slimeball.

539
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:57,848
I mean, a real deranged, violent psycho.
You know what I mean?

540
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,322
I mean, a guy
who would rip your heart out...

541
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:03,019
and eat it, just for pleasure!

542
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,961
I'm talking about a total maniac!

543
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:09,257
Do you know what I mean?

544
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,835
Why aren't we moving?

545
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,805
Don't you want to give me a ride?

546
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:24,509
-I'm only going about another mile.
-Then what the hell did you pick me up for?

547
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,176
You think I got nothing better to do
with my life...

548
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:30,311
than to sit here
and to pass the time with you?

549
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,884
Shitbrain!

550
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:40,024
I don't think I want this ride after all.

551
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:44,395
And I think I'll take your wife,
if you don't mind.

552
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,474
-Shit.
-The luggage!

553
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:59,205
Gib, are you okay?

554
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:07,322
Told you you shouldn't have taken that ride.

555
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:10,986
-That's because you know everything, right?
-That's right.

556
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:16,399
Then you should also know
that you make it virtually impossible...

557
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:20,460
for anyone to be grateful
for anything nice you might have done.

558
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:28,768
I'm sorry, okay?

559
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,740
-Yeah.
-You okay?

560
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,654
Why did you get on the back of that truck?

561
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:47,321
Because I'm the kind of guy
that likes to live on the edge.

562
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:03,809
I just want to get on that bus,
and tilt the seat back...

563
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:06,577
and fall asleep, and wake up in California.

564
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:10,017
Check out those guys.
Wonder what they majored in.

565
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:12,554
-Where to?
-Los Angeles.

566
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:15,250
That'll be $89.50.

567
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:19,422
-Bus number 33, now boarding outside.
-Thank you.

568
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,929
-Where to?
-Nowhere. Just browsing.

569
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:28,567
Tell me, those guys over there?
Do they sleep here all night?

570
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,039
Come on, I want to get a good seat.

571
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,370
Where to?

572
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:41,480
Where's your ticket?

573
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:44,047
I've been thinking it over. I'm gonna hitch.

574
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,749
The way I see it,
I'm not getting any younger.

575
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:50,760
This could be my last chance to see
the real America, really relate to the people.

576
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,455
Loan me $1.

577
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:57,097
Change a $5?

578
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:59,226
-How much money do you have?
-That's $1.

579
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,565
-I got money.
-That's $2.

580
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,299
-How much?
-Enough.

581
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:06,336
-Can you loan me $1.23?
-Sure.

582
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,974
How much do you got there?

583
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,811
$18.77.

584
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:21,046
How did you expect to get to California
on $18.77?

585
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,226
I'll get by.

586
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:27,921
I have $20. You can have $50.

587
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,329
-I can't take that.
-You can. Come on.

588
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,638
You can pay me back
after Christmas. Take it.

589
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:41,967
-I won't forget this.
-You will. But I'll remind you.

590
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,045
Last call for bus number 33,
leaving for St. Louis...

591
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:50,109
Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Albuquerque,
Tucson and Los Angeles.

592
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:52,384
There's your bus. You better hurry.

593
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:01,694
Are you sure you'll be okay?

594
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:04,632
Don't you worry about me.
You go have a good trip.

595
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,506
-See you.
-'Bye.

596
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:04,619
Back. Give Hercules some room.

597
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:11,126
Hercules stands no chance
against the sea monster.

598
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,096
Anything good on?

599
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:17,602
-Your bus just left.
-I know.

600
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,771
Why weren't you on it?

601
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:23,938
I'm the kind of gal
who likes to live on the edge.

602
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,118
We're gonna have to use a towel, here.

603
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:31,348
This could get very messy,
if you don't know what you're doing.

604
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:33,753
This is called shotgunning beer.

605
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:38,227
It's an ancient tribal custom.
Originated in Southeast Asia, I believe.

606
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:42,061
Take the beer.
Poke a hole in it, as I will do now...

607
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:49,171
using any household appliance.
I'm using a pen.

608
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:54,005
Make it just big enough
to fit your mouth over it.

609
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:58,541
Eighty-six the pen, and then in one swift....

610
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,784
Now listen to me, it's very important.

611
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:03,718
In one swift, deft motion,
you're gonna take it...

612
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:06,950
pull it up, and then release the cork.
Not the cork, this thing...

613
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:10,118
and all the beer will slide down
to your throat in two seconds.

614
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:12,628
-Now wait. Are you sure you're ready?
-I'm ready.

615
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:15,358
For all you kids watching,
this is very dangerous.

616
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:18,094
Let's not try this at home, all right?

617
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,527
-Sure you're ready?
-I can't believe I'm doing this.

618
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:23,869
-It's good for you.
-Mom, forgive me.

619
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:27,403
Swallow, swallow!

620
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,907
"Danger, Will Robinson!"

621
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,544
-Definite shotgun potential.
-But it went up my nose.

622
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:38,019
For a beginner,
it's amazing what you just did.

623
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:40,221
Really nice.

624
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:42,318
Really?

625
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:51,465
I just remembered, I got to check something.

626
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,123
Listen, tonight I'll sleep on the floor.

627
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,994
-I don't think so.
-I don't want any arguments from you.

628
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:25,228
I mean, it's only fair.
Last night, I slept on the bed--

629
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:29,739
Jason, I don't think so. It's gonna take me
a bit longer than I anticipated.

630
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:32,934
Today's the 19th. Better not expect me...

631
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,638
till the 22nd or 23rd, at the earliest.

632
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:39,043
Everything's fine. Really.

633
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,384
I'll call you tomorrow.

634
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:43,447
Promise.

635
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:45,888
I miss you, Jason.

636
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:50,552
I've got this great big bed,
and no one to share it with.

637
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,528
-What are you doing?
-I'm going for a walk.

638
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,697
-It's almost midnight.
-It's too stuffy in here.

639
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,169
I'm here.

640
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,135
Are you 21?

641
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,709
Okay, Dr. Levinson, what'll it be?

642
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,214
Double bourbon and a beer chaser.

643
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,242
Come on, Giblet, one more time.

644
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:20,476
I can't. Tomorrow, I promise.

645
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,875
It was so good.

646
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:25,782
It was so masterful. Relentless...

647
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,681
but with a delicate touch.

648
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:30,889
Confident. Creative.

649
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:33,355
I was overwhelmed.

650
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,593
You're a true artist.

651
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:38,634
Just let me sleep awhile, regain my strength.

652
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:41,669
Five minutes. A grace period, if you will.

653
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:43,133
Please.

654
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:45,865
What the heck.

655
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:48,338
Howdy.

656
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:52,580
-Mind if I sit here?
-Sure, buddy, go ahead.

657
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,710
Thank you kindly.

658
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:58,615
-Two beers.
-And another double bourbon.

659
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:05,385
I got one of them sweepstakes flyers
in the mail today...

660
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:10,626
and I can't figure
if it's worth the effort to send it in.

661
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,626
You think I should bother?

662
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:18,435
Probably not.

663
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:22,702
She says she's from Paris.

664
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:24,703
I don't believe that.

665
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:27,173
Paris women...

666
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:31,421
don't give you a hard time, like they do here.

667
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:35,083
To a Paris woman, sex is an art.

668
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:38,093
I was in Paris once, with my wife.

669
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:42,555
Boy, am I glad she's dead.

670
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:45,362
One tequila eggnog.

671
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,966
I had fried food again for lunch today.

672
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,438
I know I shouldn't have had it...

673
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:55,470
but I couldn't help myself.

674
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,280
You think I lack self-discipline?

675
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,453
What's wrong with me?
I'm a good-looking guy.

676
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,819
You are a good-looking guy.

677
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,149
And I'm a good-looking guy.

678
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:10,716
-You are.
-I am.

679
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,228
We're all three good-looking guys.

680
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,757
That's right. We are.

681
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:20,191
And it's Christmastime,
and I'm gonna buy you a drink.

682
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,966
-What are you drinking?
-Something light.

683
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,441
-What, like a nice Chablis?
-A spritzer.

684
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:30,846
Barkeep, give this man a trough of spritzer.

685
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:34,249
And you, cowboy guy,
what do you want to drink?

686
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:37,150
-I'll have a beer.
-Get cowboy guy a beer.

687
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:40,081
It's on me tonight. Drinks are on me.

688
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,279
They're on me.

689
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:50,997
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire

690
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:56,003
Jack Frost nipping at your nose

691
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:01,672
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir

692
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:05,837
and folks dressed up like Eskimos

693
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,448
Everybody knows

694
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,851
that turkey and some mistletoe

695
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:38,808
Where've you been?

696
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,052
This guy, Jason...

697
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:54,323
may be a real brain and all,
but can he do this?

698
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:30,195
Don't worry, Mom, I'll take the garbage out
in the morning, I promise.

699
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:42,108
Chestnuts roasting on the fire

700
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,922
Come on, let's go.

701
00:54:57,994 --> 00:55:01,395
-Okay, do you have everything?
-I have everything. You have everything.

702
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:04,262
-Sure?
-We all have everything. Everything's fine.

703
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,927
-Let's go.
-You can't rush me.

704
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:11,534
She's checking under the thing.
What is under there, I don't know.

705
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:14,839
-A bathroom. Again with the bathroom.
-You can't rush me!

706
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:17,505
We've got to travel by day. So let's go.

707
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:20,982
-Look at the time. We got to go.
-We're all proceeding, here.

708
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:23,417
-Just check everything.
-We got everything, here.

709
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,579
We're out of here.

710
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:39,196
God, I'm starving.

711
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:41,635
-How does it feel?
-Needs more bulk.

712
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:43,764
We can't eat for 200 miles.

713
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,501
What are you telling me, woman?

714
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:48,874
-I worked out a schedule.
-Another schedule. Great.

715
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,908
I computed
exactly how much money we have...

716
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:55,382
how long it'll take us to get there,
how many meals we have to have.

717
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:58,046
It came out to one meal every 200 miles.

718
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,180
After 700, though, we can have a snack.

719
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:03,350
Good. Cheetos in Albuquerque.
I can hardly wait.

720
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:08,722
-What do you think, nine months?
-More like 15.

721
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:14,127
Excellent. Very pregnant.

722
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,676
-What are you gonna name it?
-What?

723
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:22,775
The baby.

724
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:24,610
The baby.

725
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:28,577
If it's a girl, Cynthia.

726
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:30,909
And if it's a boy...

727
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:33,549
Elliot.

728
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,021
Those are lovely names.

729
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:39,550
Elliot? You're gonna name the kid Elliot?

730
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:42,354
You can't name the kid Elliot.

731
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:45,400
Elliot is a fat kid with glasses
who eats paste.

732
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:49,131
Not gonna name the kid Elliot.
Got to give him a real name.

733
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:51,099
Give him a name.

734
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:53,402
-Like Nick.
-Nick?

735
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:57,242
Nick's a real name. Nick's your buddy.

736
00:56:57,714 --> 00:57:01,150
Nick's the kind of guy you can trust,
someone you can drink beer with.

737
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:04,516
Kind of guy who doesn't mind
if you puke in his car.

738
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,487
-God.
-Vomit, I'm sorry.

739
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:15,453
-Thank you.
-Merry Christmas to you.

740
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:24,639
I'm gonna have a huge orange juice,
three eggs, two sides of bacon...

741
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:27,835
home fries, four pieces of toast,
and then lunch!

742
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:30,778
You sure we can eat?
I don't know if we've gone 200 miles.

743
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:33,042
I don't want to throw your schedule off.

744
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,710
Leave me alone. I'm a pregnant woman.

745
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,256
How could you lose your money?

746
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:47,660
-I put it in my schedule book.
-How could you lose your schedule book?

747
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:50,824
That's the most important thing in your life,
that stupid book!

748
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,392
You wouldn't even remember your name
without it. This is just excellent!

749
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,798
I'm starving.

750
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:36,709
Thank you.

751
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,915
I'm freezing to death.

752
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,390
My feet are killing me.

753
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:57,900
I just swallowed my gum.

754
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:01,266
Your incessant complaining
isn't doing us any good.

755
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,371
Can't you try and look on the bright side?

756
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:16,783
Over there!

757
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:43,139
Over there. There's a trailer, come on.

758
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:52,477
It's locked! This is very good.

759
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:56,082
It's important that this place
should have an airtight security system...

760
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:58,184
in the middle of nowhere!

761
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,726
Wait, I might have a nail file.

762
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,266
I have a credit card.

763
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,407
Credit cards work
on a completely different kind of lock.

764
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:17,742
I don't think you understand.
I have a credit card.

765
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:19,644
You have a credit card?

766
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:30,955
My dad told me, specifically,
I can only use it in case of an emergency.

767
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:34,727
Maybe one will come up.

768
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,991
Too bad this is the only place
that takes credit cards.

769
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,433
Real shame.

770
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:43,095
Here, try some of my veal.

771
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:47,699
Only if you try some of this salmon.

772
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:50,177
I'm not a big fish guy, so you take it.

773
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:52,714
I'm not gonna eat that, but you try the veal--

774
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:54,443
-I'm not gonna--
-Try it.

775
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:59,414
It's good? See, I told you.

776
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:02,690
So, you were saying?

777
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:06,126
Anyway, my father.... He grew up on a farm.

778
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:10,558
He always thought it was a real shame
that we only saw the suburbs.

779
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:13,932
He used to take us on great camping trips.
Want more wine?

780
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:19,603
One night, I was sleeping in my pup tent
with my younger brother.

781
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:22,201
I must have been, what, six or seven.

782
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:26,303
I woke up in the middle of the night,
and I had to get outside.

783
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:30,483
I don't know why.
I just really wanted to go outside.

784
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:34,455
It was dark. I mean, totally dark.

785
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:37,886
Not like in the city, or even in the suburbs.

786
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,928
I'm talking absolute blackness.

787
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:42,863
You couldn't see
two inches in front of your face.

788
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,992
But there's one thing you could see.

789
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,663
Millions of things, really.

790
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,007
You could see the stars.

791
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:56,977
There were more stars out that night
than I've ever seen since.

792
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:00,513
Believe me, I've looked.

793
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:04,246
I'm standing there,
looking up at the sky, and I'm thinking...

794
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,321
that each one of these dots of light
is another world.

795
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:11,053
I didn't know the difference
between the stars and the planets, then.

796
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:14,927
But it made me feel really small.

797
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,595
Lonely.

798
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:23,272
Do you know what I mean?

799
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:30,112
Then I thought,
maybe on each one of these other worlds...

800
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:33,880
there's a kid like me.
Only, he's shaped like a sponge...

801
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:37,181
or a pinball machine, or something.
Whatever, but he's up there.

802
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:41,255
Maybe he's on a camping trip,
and he's looking up at the stars.

803
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:45,928
I decided I want to meet this guy.

804
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:54,169
-A rose for the lady?
-Would the lady care for a rose?

805
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:58,773
Would the lady care to advance
the gentleman the cost of a rose?

806
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:01,366
Put it on the bill. That'd be great.

807
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,408
For you.

808
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:09,374
-Thank you.
-lt was nothing.

809
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:41,175
You don't have to sleep on the floor.

810
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:42,641
What?

811
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,514
You don't have to sleep on the floor.

812
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:49,991
Are you sure?

813
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,229
I won't try anything, I swear.

814
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:01,501
I trust you.

815
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:26,856
Good night.

816
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:44,106
How's your lawyer?

817
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:46,812
My lawyer?

818
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:50,046
What's his name? Jimmy, Jeremy.

819
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:52,376
Jason.

820
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,688
How is Jason, anyway?

821
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:00,595
Jason's fine.

822
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,564
-I guess you really miss him.
-I haven't seen him since last summer.

823
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:15,141
What's he like?

824
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:21,672
Jason is very directed. He's a real achiever.

825
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:26,583
I know, but what is he like?
I mean, what kind of beer does he drink?

826
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:30,647
Is he funny? Does he make you laugh?

827
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:38,797
-He is everything a girl looks for in a guy.
-He sounds perfect.

828
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:43,670
We both want the same things out of life.

829
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:46,640
We're both gonna be lawyers.
Damn good ones.

830
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:50,445
We might even open a practice together,
up in Vermont.

831
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:53,738
-Somewhere in the country.
-I get it.

832
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:56,216
Jason is the real outdoorsy type.

833
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,148
Clear, freshwater streams,
fragrant meadows...

834
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:02,782
biodegradable toilet paper, the works.

835
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:06,422
It's just that we both like old farmhouses.

836
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:09,890
We thought it'd be nice to find one
and restore it ourselves.

837
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:13,197
Jason thinks
it would make a good investment.

838
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:17,399
I just want it to be nice and warm and cozy.

839
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:19,999
Kind of like this.

840
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:31,284
And we're both crazy about basset hounds.

841
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:41,058
I guess that sounds kind of tame to you.

842
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:45,961
It sounds nice.

843
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:47,868
Good night, Alison.

844
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:55,607
Good night, Gib.

845
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:59,262
-I didn't try anything, I swear.
-I know.

846
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:04,230
-You were on my side of the bed.
-It's all right.

847
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:06,897
-Nothing happened.
-I know.

848
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:17,752
I'm just gonna go out
on the veranda thing for a while.

849
01:10:08,504 --> 01:10:11,632
-Where you headed?
-Los Angeles.

850
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:14,333
It's your lucky day. Come on, let's go!

851
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:19,709
I got it.

852
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:34,652
So what's in California?

853
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:36,722
A girl.

854
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:40,993
-What's wrong with her?
-She's got a boyfriend.

855
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:43,032
Too bad.

856
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:52,340
-What's she like?
-Who?

857
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:57,047
-Your girlfriend.
-I don't know. I've never met her.

858
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,749
You never met her.

859
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:04,921
You're going across the country
to see a girl you never met.

860
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:09,023
My best friend, Lance, set it up.

861
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,089
Supposed to be a sure thing.

862
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:12,633
A sure thing?

863
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:24,140
A sure thing, no questions asked,
no strings attached--

864
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:25,646
No guilt involved.

865
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:27,238
A sure thing.

866
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:34,049
My whole life, I never had a sure thing.

867
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:39,687
Probably never meet her anyway.
She's gonna be gone in 24 hours.

868
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:43,055
You pay for the traffic tickets,
I'll get you in the saddle.

869
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:28,900
-Thank you.
-Thanks a lot.

870
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:33,739
I hope you fully appreciate the magnitude
of your impending good fortune.

871
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:34,976
I do.

872
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:40,546
Alison, where are you going?

873
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:48,260
Wait up.

874
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:53,028
What is it with you?

875
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:56,595
You haven't said two words to me
since Arizona.

876
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,803
-See you around.
-That's it?

877
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:04,137
-"See you around"?
-lsn't that what you want?

878
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:07,910
No questions asked? No strings attached?
No guilt involved?

879
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:12,649
Have fun with your sure thing.

880
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:20,027
-I bought this for you.
-I bought it!

881
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:24,726
It's the thought that counts.

882
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:41,949
Here we are.

883
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:49,150
Here, let me take that from you.
It's really great to see you.

884
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:59,325
I cleared out this drawer for you.

885
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:04,738
And you can use this half of the closet.

886
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:10,301
I bought some of those hangers
you like so much.

887
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:15,414
We'll just put your bags up there
after you've unpacked...

888
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:17,452
get them out of the way.

889
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:20,989
It's so good to see you.

890
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:30,223
Look.

891
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:37,362
Flannel sheets.

892
01:14:38,907 --> 01:14:43,037
You know, the longer you use them,
the softer they get.

893
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,637
By the time we find our farmhouse...

894
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:49,775
my goodness,
they'll be incredible, won't they?

895
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:54,578
Are you all right?

896
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,954
Yes. Great.

897
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:00,658
-I guess I'm just exhausted from the trip.
-Tired.

898
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:03,493
Those sheets are great.

899
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:08,662
-I know what you need.
-What?

900
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:10,769
A good hot mug of tea.

901
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:15,040
Restores both body and spirit.
Let's see what we have this week.

902
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:17,476
Let's see, we've got some Darjeeling...

903
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:20,374
English Breakfast.

904
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:23,577
That's more of a studying tea, isn't it?

905
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:27,085
Let's see, Lapsang Souchong,
for those rainy mornings.

906
01:15:28,223 --> 01:15:29,554
Earl Grey.

907
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:32,620
Remember that camping trip to Vermont?

908
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,965
Of course. China Black.

909
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:41,636
How about a good hot mug of China Black?

910
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:44,968
Do you have any beer?

911
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:10,661
Walter Gibson.

912
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:14,736
Private Gibson, incoming!

913
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:20,507
How are you doing, buddy?

914
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,771
-How are you?
-Good to see you. Looking good.

915
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:25,506
Looking good. Glad you made it.
Welcome to California...

916
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:29,517
home of the waves and the babes.
I want you to meet some people.

917
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:32,679
Guys, this is Gib, the guy I told you about.
I said he'd make it.

918
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:35,689
-Hey, dude.
-Nice to meet you.

919
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:39,523
3,000 miles just to get laid?
I really respect that.

920
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:43,159
Tonight is the night, Gib, man.

921
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:45,426
-Merry Christmas.
-I love you.

922
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:47,226
I don't think she believes me.

923
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:49,099
-Why is that, man?
-I don't know.

924
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:52,732
You are gonna love California.
You ever make it with an avocado?

925
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:53,968
Party!

926
01:16:57,012 --> 01:16:58,070
Gin.

927
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,142
Let's see, that makes 25 for me...

928
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:03,111
plus...

929
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:10,249
43...

930
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:13,992
so, 25 plus 43 is....

931
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:16,557
Can I borrow that?

932
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:25,599
Sorry.

933
01:17:27,242 --> 01:17:28,641
There you go.

934
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:32,245
...which makes the score 233 for me...

935
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:37,076
and 8 for you.

936
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:49,191
Charming.

937
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:54,891
It sounds like someone's having a party.
Let's go. It'll be fun.

938
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:59,298
You know how we feel about parties.
They're hot, loud and crowded.

939
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:02,207
The only reason anyone goes to them
is to pick someone up.

940
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:04,609
Now, why would we want to do that?

941
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:09,317
-Let's go to Disneyland.
-Disneyland is for children.

942
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:17,389
Let's do something pointless,
something totally crazy.

943
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:21,087
-All right. I tell you what.
-What?

944
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:25,823
I'll spot you 50 points.
That'll add some excitement to the game.

945
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:38,774
I really don't want to wear this stuff.
I really don't.

946
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:41,577
-What do you mean? You look fantastic.
-Come with me.

947
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:44,118
What's the first thing you'll do
when you meet her?

948
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:46,518
Shave my head
and join a Polynesian monastery.

949
01:18:46,588 --> 01:18:49,216
-What do you mean?
-Tito. Isn't that nice?

950
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:51,156
-What are you doing?
-Like that?

951
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:53,217
-What's going on?
-I look like a moron.

952
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:56,560
What do you mean, you look like a moron?
Look at me.

953
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:59,260
You don't like green? Is that it?

954
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:02,201
-I'll get you blue, or the red.
-I don't want anyone.

955
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:04,033
-Come on.
-Because I don't.

956
01:19:04,106 --> 01:19:07,564
What do you mean, because you don't?
What is that?

957
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:09,503
You know what?

958
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:13,275
You happen to be developing
a very bad attitude, young man.

959
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:19,381
Don't move, because she's here.

960
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:22,619
It's her. Look.

961
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:28,820
Tonight is the first night
of the rest of your sex life.

962
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,963
You're gonna kill me.
I don't think I can go through with this.

963
01:19:34,035 --> 01:19:36,868
-I knew it. The breasts are too small?
-Breasts are fine.

964
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:38,667
-Hi, how you doing?
-How are you?

965
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:41,368
-This is a drink for you.
-ls that him?

966
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:44,538
-Yeah.
-He's cute.

967
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:48,707
He's kind of going through
a little climate adjustment.

968
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:51,651
And so we're gonna be with you
in just a minute.

969
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:56,282
So why don't you just go over there
and look for something, okay?

970
01:19:56,525 --> 01:19:59,358
-All right.
-I love you, babe. You look good.

971
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:04,129
What's the problem?
What's wrong with you?

972
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:08,693
I don't know. I'm almost 19.
Maybe I'm getting too old for this.

973
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:11,300
What do you want?
A goddamn relationship?

974
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:13,364
I don't know what I want.

975
01:20:14,075 --> 01:20:16,771
-Maybe it's a moral issue.
-Moral issue?

976
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:20,573
This is Lance you're talking to.
You have no morals.

977
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:26,313
You're just in a slump, that's all.
It happens to the best of us.

978
01:20:26,788 --> 01:20:31,054
It could happen to me someday.
I doubt it, but it could. You nervous?

979
01:20:31,626 --> 01:20:32,615
Get out!

980
01:20:32,694 --> 01:20:35,356
You're nervous,
because you haven't done it in a while.

981
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:39,366
It's like riding a bike.
You just got to climb on and keep pedaling.

982
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:41,868
And wear something white at night.

983
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:46,099
You want a relationship? That's fine.

984
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:50,372
Just remember that every relationship
starts with a one-night stand.

985
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:53,680
You came 3,000 miles for a reason,
didn't you?

986
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:55,579
Would you look at that reason?

987
01:20:58,486 --> 01:21:00,511
Go for it, you've earned it.

988
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:05,553
-Lance, you're right.
-That's right.

989
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:07,788
I'm not being unfaithful to anyone.

990
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:10,730
Hell, I could use a torrid night
of cheap, meaningless lust.

991
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:13,233
That's right, buddy. There you go.

992
01:21:15,437 --> 01:21:17,234
Look at these people.

993
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:19,871
They probably think
they're having a good time.

994
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:36,522
Let's dance.

995
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:40,155
-Since when do you like to dance?
-Since tonight.

996
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,403
That's a nice shirt.

997
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:58,511
From Hawaii.

998
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:08,722
It's been a long time
since I've held you like this.

999
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:09,984
I know.

1000
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:15,627
Lance said you were very shy around girls.

1001
01:22:17,799 --> 01:22:20,529
Did he mention what a great dancer I am?

1002
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,739
What else did Lance tell you about me?

1003
01:22:33,815 --> 01:22:35,908
He says you're a real gourmet.

1004
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:38,210
-And you're a virgin.
-What?

1005
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,880
He thinks you might be gay.

1006
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:45,686
I didn't say it. Lance said it.

1007
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:50,221
Excuse me, won't you?

1008
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:53,790
I have to go kick the shit out of someone.
Just one second.

1009
01:22:56,871 --> 01:23:00,170
-You told her I was a virgin?
-I exaggerated a little.

1010
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:02,573
Girls like virgins.
They find them a challenge.

1011
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:05,841
-You told her I was gay!
-It's a bigger challenge.

1012
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:11,842
Keep your shirt on, buddy,
you're doing great.

1013
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,947
Excuse me. I see a sweet young thing
whose sarong needs adjusting.

1014
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:18,550
Get out of my life.

1015
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:37,468
Excuse me, I'd like to get some punch.

1016
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:40,804
Please, allow me.

1017
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:44,182
-Thank you.
-You're very welcome.

1018
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:52,892
She's got lovely skin, and so much of it.

1019
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:56,393
She happens to be an excellent judge
in quality shirt wear.

1020
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:58,989
She should try wearing one, sometime.

1021
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:06,835
-Would you like a cup for Justin?
-Jason.

1022
01:24:06,908 --> 01:24:10,435
-Whatever. He probably eats paste.
-Justin's twice the man you'll ever be.

1023
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:11,501
Jason.

1024
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:14,571
-He's loyal, he's trustworthy--
-Housebroken?

1025
01:24:16,951 --> 01:24:18,919
Do you know this person?

1026
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:21,186
Not really.

1027
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:23,690
-Would you like a drink?
-No, thank you.

1028
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:28,294
Jason, let's go to bed.

1029
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:32,022
Careful, she hogs all the blankets.

1030
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:35,035
-You snore.
-Not tonight, I won't.

1031
01:24:35,537 --> 01:24:37,402
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

1032
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:40,737
How would you like to go up
to Lance's room for a drink?

1033
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:42,140
All right.

1034
01:24:42,477 --> 01:24:43,535
Let's go.

1035
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:47,279
Good night.

1036
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:55,154
-He doesn't even know that girl!
-How do you know that guy?

1037
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:56,918
It was all set up by his friend.

1038
01:24:56,991 --> 01:25:00,154
He thinks love is something
you order on the phone, like a pizza!

1039
01:25:00,228 --> 01:25:03,459
-How do you know he snores?
-He thinks he knows all about stars.

1040
01:25:03,531 --> 01:25:06,056
He doesn't know Cassiopeia's
the mother of Andromeda.

1041
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:09,228
-How's he know you hog the blankets?
-The crap he eats...

1042
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:11,295
cheese balls and beer for breakfast!

1043
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:13,567
How do you know
what he eats for breakfast?

1044
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:22,948
Come on in.

1045
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:35,119
Want to sit down?

1046
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:38,559
-Do you want me to?
-Why don't you sit down?

1047
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:39,964
All right.

1048
01:25:43,938 --> 01:25:46,031
-Do you want a drink?
-Sure.

1049
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:49,803
Great.

1050
01:26:03,057 --> 01:26:04,251
Thanks.

1051
01:26:10,765 --> 01:26:12,426
That's strong.

1052
01:26:25,747 --> 01:26:28,181
Lance sure does drink a lot of beer.

1053
01:26:31,152 --> 01:26:33,052
A lot of it's imported.

1054
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:41,495
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine. Why, don't I look fine?

1055
01:26:41,563 --> 01:26:44,430
-I don't know, it just seems like--
-I'm not.

1056
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:53,701
-ls it that girl at the punch bowl?
-No.

1057
01:26:53,775 --> 01:26:57,404
It's nothing.
Particularly not that girl at the punch bowl.

1058
01:26:59,514 --> 01:27:01,914
Why didn't you tell me about him?

1059
01:27:03,151 --> 01:27:06,018
Because he's not worth mentioning.
He's a creep.

1060
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:24,670
You made love to him, didn't you?

1061
01:27:27,475 --> 01:27:29,466
-Did you make love to him?
-No.

1062
01:27:29,544 --> 01:27:32,104
-Honest?
-Honest.

1063
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:37,576
Do you love him?

1064
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:01,074
I have to go to the library. I'm really behind.

1065
01:28:01,142 --> 01:28:04,873
That's what I should've done.
I didn't study all this week.

1066
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:06,706
Me, neither.

1067
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:20,091
Want some?

1068
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:24,298
Good morning, everybody.

1069
01:28:24,532 --> 01:28:27,626
You're gonna have to talk to me
sooner or later.

1070
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:30,165
-No, thank you.
-All right. Here we go.

1071
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:34,572
I've got a very pleasant surprise today.
Comes from an unlikely source.

1072
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:37,134
Walter Gibson.

1073
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:41,673
It is called The Sure Thing.

1074
01:28:44,285 --> 01:28:46,913
"'lt could be tonight,' he thought...

1075
01:28:47,422 --> 01:28:50,414
"as he stood in the corner,
pretending to have a good time.

1076
01:28:50,491 --> 01:28:52,584
"He would meet her tonight.

1077
01:28:52,894 --> 01:28:56,830
"All his young life,
he had dreamed of a girl like this.

1078
01:28:57,498 --> 01:28:59,898
"5'6", silky hair...

1079
01:29:00,368 --> 01:29:02,268
"trim, nubile body...."

1080
01:29:03,471 --> 01:29:05,962
"Nubile," by the way, is spelled with a "u."

1081
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:09,435
"...nubile body
that really knew how to move...

1082
01:29:09,777 --> 01:29:12,769
"and soft, deeply tanned skin.

1083
01:29:13,981 --> 01:29:17,280
"Now, as for personality traits,
she needed only one.

1084
01:29:17,752 --> 01:29:20,687
"She had to love sex, and all the time.

1085
01:29:21,255 --> 01:29:25,692
"To arrive at this moment,
he had traveled vast distances...

1086
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:28,222
"enduring many hardships:

1087
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:31,530
"abject poverty, starvation...

1088
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,169
"show tunes, you name it.

1089
01:29:36,838 --> 01:29:40,035
"From across the room he saw her.
She was perfect.

1090
01:29:41,342 --> 01:29:45,244
"He knew almost nothing about her,
and she didn't know much more about him.

1091
01:29:45,313 --> 01:29:49,909
"lt was exactly how it was supposed to be.
He brought her to his room.

1092
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:54,516
"The lights were soft, the moment was right.

1093
01:29:56,591 --> 01:29:59,856
"Then she leaned over
and whispered in his ear:

1094
01:30:01,295 --> 01:30:02,956
"'Do you love me?'

1095
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:09,233
"Thoughts raced through his mind.
Did she really want him?

1096
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:14,167
"What had he done to deserve this bounty?
Does God exist?

1097
01:30:14,542 --> 01:30:17,033
"Who invented liquid soap, and why?

1098
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:22,809
"'Do you love me?' Staring into her eyes...

1099
01:30:23,785 --> 01:30:26,686
"he knew that she really needed to hear it.

1100
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:33,019
"But for the first time in his life,
he knew these were no longer just words.

1101
01:30:34,729 --> 01:30:38,290
"And if he said it, it would be a lie.

1102
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:43,366
"'Do you love me?' she whispered.
'Do you love me?'

1103
01:30:44,839 --> 01:30:46,830
"lt would not be tonight.

1104
01:30:48,075 --> 01:30:50,168
"The answer was 'no."'

1105
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:52,572
He was a traitor!

1106
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:06,984
You didn't sleep with her?

1107
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:09,729
Still seeing Jason?

1108
01:31:10,665 --> 01:31:12,132
We broke up.

1109
01:31:13,201 --> 01:31:14,668
That's too bad.

1110
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:23,841
You didn't sleep with her.

1111
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:27,342
She wasn't my type.
