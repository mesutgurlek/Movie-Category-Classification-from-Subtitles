It's the strangest goddamn story
that I ever covered.

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,300
It started the day that Margaret Ulbrich
walked out on her suffocating husband,

769
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,980
You are the only living soul
I can tell my secret to.

770
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:52,940
Well... I painted them.

771
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,780
I did. Every single one of them.

772
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,824
Every big eye. Me.

773
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,622
And no one will ever know but you.

774
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,940
And I'm gonna paint
another one right now.

775
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:11,351
To tick Walter off, maybe I'll paint one
about a crazy girl talking to a dog.

777
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,380
Stumbled onto some hot gossip.

778
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:37,507
Madame Chiang Kai-shek is coming
to town, straight from Taipei.

779
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,820
I think we should present her
with a painting.

780
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,060
Get Dick to flack it.

781
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:49,020
Or the hell with Dick.
I met a new guy at UPI.

782
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:52,860
Maybe, uh... she'd like one
of your street scenes.

783
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,460
Yeah, I don't know. I thought you could
whip off a doodle of Chinatown.

784
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,745
With a cute little girl,
sort of a big-eyed, slanty-eyed thing.

785
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,740
No.

786
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:08,740
No, no. She is a dignitary,
and she deserves a piece

787
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,624
that comes straight from you.

788
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,500
- You think?
- Uh-huh.

789
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,980
Maybe you're right.

790
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:20,460
She probably doesn't have a Parisian
street scene hanging in her palace.

791
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:24,028
Unless Madame Chiang Kai-shek
already has a Cenic.

792
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,660
- What's that?
- A Cenic.

793
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,751
That's the painter that painted
all your early work.

794
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,350
(LAUGHS)

795
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,500
It's Scenic!

796
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,980
That's my nickname in Paris!

797
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,260
All my art school pals
loved my scenic views so much,

798
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,660
they called me... well,
they couldn't pronounce it properly,

799
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,780
so they called me "Cenic."

800
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,824
The more you lie, the smaller you seem.

801
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,980
How dare you accuse me of lying!
I'm proud of my early Cenics!

802
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,660
Then why did you paint over the name?

803
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,780
A piece of advice,
never use water-based over an oil.

804
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,550
It'll just fleck right off.

805
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:13,342
You sound crazy!
For God's sake, you've seen me paint!

806
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,824
No, I haven't.

807
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,740
I always thought that I had,
but it's like a mirage.

808
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:26,547
From a distance,
you look like a painter,

809
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,471
but up close there's
just not much there.

810
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,220
I've been to Paris!
I studied at the Beaux-Arts!

811
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,580
At the Grand Chaumiere!

812
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,260
I spent hours and hours in the Louvre,

813
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,340
staring at the greatness of the masters!

814

I wanted...
I so wanted to become an artist.

817
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:08,104
It just never turned out so well.

818
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,180
I don't want you
sleeping here any longer.

819
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:26,544
There are three extra bedrooms
in this house. Go pick one.

820
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,380
How many more of these are in the back?

821
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,860
- I don't know. Um, maybe 3,000 or so.
- Does the printer owe us more?

822
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,620
Excuse me, miss.
How much is this painting?

823
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:59,220
- Go! What do I pay you for?
- Yes, Mr. Keane.

824
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,751
Sorry about that...

825
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,621
It's not even one of mine.
It's one of hers.

826
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,828
This doesn't change anything.

827
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,940
- I know the truth.
- Who cares?

828
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,540
Maybe it's time to shake things up.

Absolutely not! I already hate myself
for giving you the waifs.

I'll have you taken out!

cousin? The liquor wholesaler?

Just to calm things down.

1081
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,220
I don't know, Walter.
What she said is pretty inflammatory.

1082
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:53,540
But it's nuts! Doesn't even make sense.

1083
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:56,460
I mean, I studied art
at the Beaux-Arts in Paris.

1088
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:13,340
Why would Margaret
do something like this?

1089
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,860
(SNORTS) She's unhinged.

1090
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:18,020
She left me to move into the jungle.

I really don't know all that much
about them.

1094
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,580
They don't celebrate Christmas,
can't salute the flag.

1095
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:34,180
They won't even let Janie go
to the prom!

1096
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:35,791
Oh...

1097
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:39,300
He makes me sound crazy.

1098
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:42,660
He said that I copied him,
that he taught me how to paint.

1099
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:47,180
"She used a slide projector to
trace my work and fill in the colors."

1100
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:50,820
- Which part of that isn't true?
- All of it.

1101
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:53,580
I feel good about myself
for the first time in years,

1102
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:56,590
and I can't let Walter
just take that away from me.

Hey, is Jehovah okay with suing?

1104

Seventeen million dollars.
The art world is abuzz.

Today, at federal court, lawyers will
present their opening arguments

1106
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,940
in the case of Margaret Keane vs.
Walter Keane and Gannett Newspapers,

1107
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,100
a trial that could produce
the largest libel and slander reward

1108
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,460
- in Hawaiian history.
- MAN: Step aside, please.

- Yes?

Are you at all concerned
about the charges?

1113

I'm angry as hell.

1114
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,340
But I'm lucky I have the mighty
Gannett News company watching my back.

1115

I expect this whole trial
dismissed by noon.

get this woman some psychiatric help.

- All right. Excuse me, gentlemen.

(REPORTERS CLAMORING)

1120
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:58,460
Margaret Keane is a public figure,
and as such, she has to prove

1121
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,580
that our newspapers published statements
aware of probable falsity.

1122
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:05,460
Now there's no evidence to suggest
that our editors could have known

1123
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:06,900
these assertions were untrue.

1124
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:13,020
We would like to submit 692 articles
and interviews in which Mrs. Keane

1125
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:17,828
credits Mr. Keane as the painter
of the so-called big-eye children.

1126
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,140
How many years back do these go?

1127
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:33,310
Mrs. Keane has been making
these statements since 1958.

1128
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,508
This is a very strange case.

1129
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:41,260
These paintings hang in museums
all over the world,

1130
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,224
attributed to Mr. Keane.

1131
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,180
And regardless of the truth,
Mrs. Keane has contributed

1132
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,348
immeasurably to the confusion.

1133
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:52,700
Seems impossible that Gannett's actions

1134
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,500
would ever meet the legal standards
for libel.

1135
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,700
So the charge against them is dismissed.

1136

- Good luck? Where are you going?

We were charged with libel.
You are charged with slander.

1139
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,860
Mr. Keane?

1140
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:24,780
You appear to be without counsel.

1141

in order to get your affairs in order?

The only thing he knows
about courtrooms and lawyers

1148
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:01,580
comes from watching Perry Mason
on television.

My contribution to the world.

1152
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:15,225
Mr. Keane, I've told you, you must
ask the witness questions.

1153
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:18,860
If you're acting as your own attorney,
you cannot make statements at this time.

1154
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,141
Yeah. All right.

1155
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:24,425
It's hard to keep
all these things straight.

1156
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:31,340
Mrs. Keane, how do you expect anybody
to swallow your fantastic story?

1157
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,746
Mr. Keane...

1158
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:43,190
Mrs. Keane, you seem to be a lucid,

1159
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:46,344
reasonably intelligent woman.

1160
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:52,269
So how could you possibly have gone
along with a far-out scheme like that?

1161
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:57,107
I felt forced into it.

1162
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,785
You had me, um...

1163
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:04,831
He had me dominated.

1164
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:09,780
He would rant and rave if I didn't
give him what he wanted.

1165
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:14,020
I was afraid and I didn't see
any option, so I went along.

1166
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:15,780
May I remind you that you're under oath?

(GAVEL BANGS)

1168
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,580
I just gave in.

1169
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:24,380
I allowed him

1170
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,820
to take credit for the big eyes.

1171
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:29,540
They were a reflection of my feelings,

1172
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:32,780
and it was like losing a child.

1173
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,709
But I was weak.

1174
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:40,660
I didn't think that I could leave
and support myself and my daughter.

1175
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:45,946
And he said that nobody would buy
the paintings without his personality.

1176
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,502

saying that you would have me
knocked off if I told the truth.

- Yes.

to be a lot of innuendo

to define what really mattered,

it was that I was dedicated

01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:26,260
I cannot stomach one more wild tangent
or shaggy dog tale.

1235
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:28,340
You're not testifying,
you're filibustering.

1236
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:29,980
Federal courts are overburdened enough

1237
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:32,180
without all your
docket-clogging nonsense.

1238
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:35,220
We can stay here
until we grow old and die,

1239
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,980
but it's obvious that
this case boils down

1240
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,540
to your word versus Mrs. Keane's word.

1241
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:42,903
- Mistrial.
- No, it's not a mistrial!

1242
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,628
In my opinion, there's only one way
to clear this thing up.

1243
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,862
You're both going to paint.

1244
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:58,710
All right, bring those easels down,
set them up on both sides of the bench.

1245
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:15,260
Now, I'm not looking for a masterpiece.
I don't know much about these things.

1246
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:19,380
I'm a jurist, not an art critic.
But is one hour enough?

1247
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:21,230
Yes, Your Honor.

1248
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:29,300
Okay, then. You've both been provided
with identical supplies.

1249
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:34,028
So, without any further business,
Mrs. Keane, Mr. Keane, the court is yours.

1250
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,306
Mr. Keane?

1251
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,110
I'm just setting the mood.

1252
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:51,544
Waiting for the muse to strike.

1253
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:55,226
Well, your muse has 58 minutes.

1254
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,380
(INHALES)

1255
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:24,900
Ah!

1256
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,220
Mr. Keane? Are you all right?

1257
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:29,700
Oh, shit.

1258
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:33,020
(EXHALES) My old shoulder injury
just flared up.

1259
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:35,940
I have, um, um... bad muscles.

1260
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:40,623
It's... I've been taking medication
for the inflammation.

1261
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:42,945
So...

1262
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:46,541
(GASPS)

1263
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:59,028
I don't think I'll
be able to paint today.

1264
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:20,060
The jury found in favor
of Margaret Keane on all points.

1265
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:23,260
She won on charges of defamation,
emotional distress,

1266
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,060
and damaged reputation.

1267
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:27,100
- MAN: Congratulations!
- WOMAN: Congratulations, Margaret!

1268
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:30,900
- Thank you, thank you very much.
- WOMAN: Congratulations!

1269
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,750
Margaret, what are you going
to call the painting?

1270
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:37,949
- Uh... Exhibit 224.
- (LAUGHTER)

1271
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,149
Margaret, can I possibly
have your autograph?

1272
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,100
DICK: Two things mattered to Margaret:
her daughter and her paintings.

1273
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:49,980
And after all the crazy turns
the story took,

1274
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:53,104
she came out at the end
with both of them.

1275
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:41,706
