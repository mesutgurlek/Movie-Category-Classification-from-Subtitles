00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,854
I just don't want
the bubble to burst.

174
00:10:06,124 --> 00:10:07,682
Seems like, uh...

175
00:10:09,794 --> 00:10:12,729
whenever anything good
in my life happens,

176
00:10:12,797 --> 00:10:15,925
I'm just afraid
I'm going to lose it.

177
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:22,863
I love you.

178
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:24,875
I really love you.

179
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,676
Ditto.

180
00:10:32,751 --> 00:10:34,082
The pilot
first reported trouble

181
00:10:34,152 --> 00:10:36,086
when the number two
engine blew,

182
00:10:36,154 --> 00:10:39,590
the one in the tail
of the plane...

183
00:10:39,658 --> 00:10:41,922
Oh, Jesus,
another one?

184
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:45,523
Oh, don't watch that.

185
00:10:47,332 --> 00:10:49,766
I should cancel
my L.A. Trip.

186
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:52,928
These things always
happen in threes.

187
00:10:53,004 --> 00:10:55,063
Sam, get serious.

188
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,574
Besides, you lead
a charmed life.

189
00:10:57,642 --> 00:10:59,633
Oh, yeah?
So did they.

190
00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:02,540
It's amazing.

191
00:11:02,614 --> 00:11:04,138
Just like that.

192
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:05,477
Blackout.

193
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:07,337
&|| My love &||

194
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:10,779
&|| My darlin'&||

195
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:13,215
&|| I've hungered for... &||

196
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:14,751
What are you doing?

197
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:17,784
I couldn't sleep.

198
00:12:17,856 --> 00:12:20,791
&|| A long &||

199
00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:22,986
&|| Lonely time &||

200
00:12:23,061 --> 00:12:24,995
I must
have passed out.

201
00:12:25,063 --> 00:12:27,258
What time is it?

202
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:28,765
It's 2 a.m.

203
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:32,394
&|| And time &||

204
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,236
&|| Goes by &||

205
00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:39,674
&|| So slowly &||

206
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:42,645
&|| And time &||

207
00:12:42,714 --> 00:12:46,650
&|| Can do so much &||

208
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:50,620
&|| Are you &||

209
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:52,918
&|| Still mine &||

210
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:55,004
Oh, no.

211
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:57,162
I hope it wasn't
a masterpiece.

212
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:58,866
It's not now.

213
00:13:00,843 --> 00:13:02,208
Can I help?

214
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:03,370
Yeah.

215
00:13:03,445 --> 00:13:06,380
Put your hands here
and get them wet.

216
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,653
Just let the clay
slide between your fingers.

217
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:16,418
&|| Godspeed your love &||

218
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:21,828
&|| To me &||

219
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:30,395
&|| Lonely rivers flow &||

220
00:13:30,472 --> 00:13:32,337
&|| To the sea &||

221
00:13:32,408 --> 00:13:34,603
&|| To the sea &||

222
00:13:34,677 --> 00:13:37,703
&|| To the open arms &||

223
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,975
&|| Of the sea &||

224
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:41,914
&|| Yeah &||

225
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:45,078
&|| Lonely rivers sigh &||

226
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:46,781
&|| Wait for me &||

227
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:49,153
&|| Wait for me &||

228
00:13:49,224 --> 00:13:52,250
&|| I'll be comin'home &||

229
00:13:52,328 --> 00:13:56,492
&|| Wait for me &||

230
00:13:56,565 --> 00:13:58,965
&|| Oh &||

231
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:03,733
&|| My love &||

232
00:14:03,806 --> 00:14:07,367
&|| My darlin'&||

233
00:14:07,443 --> 00:14:09,502
&|| I've hungered &||

234
00:14:09,578 --> 00:14:14,777
&|| Hungered for your touch &||

235
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,819
&|| A long &||

236
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:21,686
&|| Lonely time &||

237
00:14:25,627 --> 00:14:29,256
&|| And time &||

238
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:32,823
&|| Goes by &||

239
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:36,667
&|| So slowly &||

240
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:38,707
&|| And time &||

241
00:14:38,774 --> 00:14:43,268
&|| Can do so much &||

242
00:14:43,345 --> 00:14:47,145
&|| Are you &||

243
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:53,416
&|| Still mine &||

244
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,392
&|| I need &||

245
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,987
&|| Your love &||

246
00:15:02,064 --> 00:15:05,227
&|| I &||

247
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,066
&|| I need your love &||

248
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:13,006
&|| Godspeed your love &||

249
00:15:13,075 --> 00:15:19,480
&|| To me &||&||

250
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:06,994
Oh, no.

251
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,963
What's the matter?

252
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:12,966
A glitch.
What's up?

253
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:15,970
The Greenberg and White accounts...
I can't get in.

254
00:16:16,038 --> 00:16:17,300
The Mac code
isn't working.

255
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:18,634
Oh, I changed it.

256
00:16:18,707 --> 00:16:19,639
Why?

257
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,336
Nothing. I want to
nose around a bit.

258
00:16:22,411 --> 00:16:23,844
Is something wrong?

259
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,709
Can you keep a secret?

260
00:16:28,684 --> 00:16:30,379
Yeah, sure.

261
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:31,714
What's up?

262
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:34,221
There's too much money
in these accounts.

263
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:36,280
Too much money?
That's impossible.

264
00:16:42,097 --> 00:16:44,861
Sam, this is going
to take you hours.

265
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:46,366
Let me do this.

266
00:16:46,435 --> 00:16:47,868
It's already
taken me hours.

267
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:49,369
Let me figure it out.

268
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:50,871
No, that's OK.

269
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:52,873
It's like
a vendetta now.

270
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:54,875
Thanks, though.
I appreciate it.

271
00:16:54,943 --> 00:16:56,035
OK.

272
00:16:56,111 --> 00:16:59,046
If you start to go blind,
give a shout.

273
00:16:59,114 --> 00:17:01,639
OK. Adios.

274
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:05,050
Listen, what are you
and Moll doing tonight?

275
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,055
We're going to the theater
to see Macbeth.

276
00:17:08,123 --> 00:17:10,182
She likes
the guys in tights.

277
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:11,692
You want to go?

278
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,852
No, thanks.

279
00:17:12,928 --> 00:17:14,555
I want a full
report, though.

280
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,722
Later.

281
00:17:15,797 --> 00:17:16,889
Yeah.

282
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:23,837
Well, I loved it.

283
00:17:23,906 --> 00:17:26,340
I was spellbound
the whole time.

284
00:17:26,408 --> 00:17:27,841
I could tell.

285
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,343
So could
everyone else

286
00:17:29,411 --> 00:17:32,039
with that resonating
snore of yours.

287
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:39,519
Did I tell you
what Melissa said?

288
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:41,021
Yeah, about six times.

289
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:42,522
It wasn't six times.

290
00:17:42,591 --> 00:17:45,025
Quit being
so blase about this.

291
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:46,526
This is really
important.

292
00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:49,029
I'll have two pieces
in her gallery.

293
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:53,033
The New York Times
reviews her gallery all the time.

294
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:54,534
Molly,
The New York Times

295
00:17:54,603 --> 00:17:56,537
is just some
frustrated little critic

296
00:17:56,605 --> 00:18:00,041
with pimples on his ass
who flunked art school.

297
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:01,473
Who cares what they think?

298
00:18:01,543 --> 00:18:03,977
About eight million
readers, that's who.

299
00:18:04,046 --> 00:18:07,880
Nah, they're just
reading the sports page.

300
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,884
Your work
is really beautiful.

301
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:11,385
It really is.

302
00:18:11,453 --> 00:18:12,545
Thanks.

303
00:18:12,621 --> 00:18:15,055
It shouldn't matter
what anyone else thinks,

304
00:18:15,123 --> 00:18:16,556
just what I think.

305
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:23,997
I want
to marry you, Sam.

306
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:25,328
What?

307
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,732
What?

308
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:29,361
Yep.

309
00:18:29,438 --> 00:18:31,770
I've been
thinking about it.

310
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,274
I've been thinking
about it a lot,

311
00:18:34,343 --> 00:18:37,540
and I think we
should just do it.

312
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:39,376
You're serious.

313
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:40,938
Yeah.

314
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,383
What's that look for?

315
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:54,345
You never wanted
to talk about it.

316
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:06,053
Do you love me, Sam?

317
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:09,217
Well, what do you think?

318
00:19:09,293 --> 00:19:11,227
Why don't you
ever say it?

319
00:19:11,295 --> 00:19:14,731
What do you mean?
I say it all the time.

320
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:16,231
No, you say "ditto,"

321
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,461
and that's
not the same.

322
00:19:20,137 --> 00:19:23,072
People say I love you
all the time,

323
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,506
and it doesn't
mean anything.

324
00:19:27,578 --> 00:19:31,105
You know, sometimes
you need to hear it.

325
00:19:32,283 --> 00:19:34,274
I need to hear it.

326
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,011
Let's go.

327
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:46,995
What should we do?

328
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:48,497
Let me handle it.

329
00:19:48,565 --> 00:19:49,998
What do you want?

330
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:52,001
Your wallet...
give it to me!

331
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:55,197
Sam, just give it to him.

332
00:19:56,674 --> 00:19:59,837
OK, just take the money.
Just leave...

333
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,639
No, Sam...

334
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:03,646
You son of a bitch!

335
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:07,646
Sam, don't!

336
00:20:08,952 --> 00:20:10,385
Somebody help us!

337
00:20:10,454 --> 00:20:12,581
Jesus Christ, Sam!

338
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,383
Just get off him.

339

Somebody help us!

00:20:19,263 --> 00:20:21,026
Sam, just let...

342
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:24,064
Sam, stop it.

00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:25,567
Stop it, Sam!

to be OK.

Oh, my God.

Oh, Sam, come on.

00:21:21,892 --> 00:21:23,416
Hold on, baby.

Help me. Please help me.

What should we do?

00:22:04,668 --> 00:22:05,760
Aah!

00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:09,037

Aah!

What's happening?

What's...

376
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:19,846
Is he breathing?

377
00:22:23,487 --> 00:22:25,751
I don't know
if he's breathing.

378

Don't die, Sam.
Hold on.

379

Hold on, baby.
Hold on.

Jesus...

Miss Jensen, if you'll just step
this way, please.

392
00:24:17,334 --> 00:24:19,962
So, what happened
to you?

393
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:22,130
What?

394
00:24:22,205 --> 00:24:24,105
You're new, huh?
I could tell.

395
00:24:24,174 --> 00:24:26,267
Are you talking to me?

396
00:24:26,343 --> 00:24:27,776
Relax. It ain't
like before.

397
00:24:27,844 --> 00:24:30,813
It's a whole new
ball of wax.

00:24:30,881 --> 00:24:32,781
Who are you?

399

I'm waiting
for my wife.

She's in the cardiac wing.
She's fighting it.

401
00:24:46,863 --> 00:24:48,228
Shot, huh?

402
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:49,731
That'll do it every time.

403
00:24:51,234 --> 00:24:52,326
Poor bastard.

404
00:24:52,402 --> 00:24:54,996
You may as well
get used to it.

405
00:24:55,072 --> 00:24:57,506
You could be here
for a long while.

406
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:04,212
Come here.
I'll tell you a secret.

407
00:25:04,281 --> 00:25:05,714
Doors ain't so bad.

Zip, zap...
they ain't nothing.

409

You'll see.
You'll catch on.

410
00:25:09,786 --> 00:25:12,220
This patient's fibrillating.
Let's move it.

411
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:14,655
Give me
the paddles.

412
00:25:14,725 --> 00:25:16,659
He ain't
going to make it.

413
00:25:16,727 --> 00:25:18,718
I've seen it
a million times.

414
00:25:18,795 --> 00:25:20,228
He's a goner.

415
00:25:20,297 --> 00:25:21,730
He's still
fibrillating.

416
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:22,890
Clear.

417
00:25:25,535 --> 00:25:26,797

00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,303
Here they come.

419
00:25:32,175 --> 00:25:33,836
Lucky bastard.

420
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,845
It could have been
the other ones.

421
00:25:36,913 --> 00:25:39,189
You never know.

422
00:25:59,442 --> 00:26:00,534
Who are...

00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:07,711
No!

Aah!

425
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:16,424
God help me.

426
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,825
Oh, God...

427
00:26:19,896 --> 00:26:21,329
help me.

428
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:30,439
"I am sunk
in the abysmal swamp

429
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,441
where there is no foothold.

430
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:35,307
I have reached
the watery depths.

431
00:26:35,378 --> 00:26:38,370
The flood overwhelms me.

432
00:26:38,448 --> 00:26:41,849
I am wearied with calling."

433
00:26:41,918 --> 00:26:45,513
As we say farewell
to our friend Sam Wheat,

434
00:26:45,588 --> 00:26:48,022
we are reminded
of his kindness...

435
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:52,050
his generosity,

436
00:26:52,128 --> 00:26:55,188
his buoyancy of spirit.

437
00:26:55,265 --> 00:26:56,857
All that we treasure...

438
00:26:56,933 --> 00:26:59,367
our loved ones,

439
00:26:59,435 --> 00:27:00,766

442
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:08,209
are but on loan to us.

443
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:11,304
We must
surrender them all.

444
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:14,316
We are all travelers
on the same road,

445
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:16,875
which leads
to the same end.

446
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,982
As our loved one
enters eternal life,

447
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,654
let us remember
that love, too, is eternal.

448
00:27:28,498 --> 00:27:30,932
That although
we will miss him,

449
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,059
our love
will light the void

450
00:27:33,136 --> 00:27:35,070
and dispel the darkness.

451
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,035
I picked up
your shirts today.

452
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:20,310
I don't know why.

453
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:28,116
Mr. Reynolds told me
to tell you hello.

454
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,119
I broke into tears.

455
00:28:36,332 --> 00:28:39,267
It's like I think
about you every minute.

456
00:28:39,335 --> 00:28:42,566
It's like
I can still feel you.

457
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,446

the matter, kitty?

461
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:06,518
What's the matter?

462
00:29:06,596 --> 00:29:09,565
Crazy cat.

464
00:29:18,074 --> 00:29:20,099
That's really
stupid.

465
00:29:31,387 --> 00:29:32,820
I love this picture.

Let me see that.

It's, um...

470
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:49,971
Sam's address book.

471
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,063
Right.

Should I toss
them?

474
00:30:00,116 --> 00:30:01,048
No.

475

No? Molly, we hated
that concert.

476
00:30:05,188 --> 00:30:06,120
Hey.

477
00:30:06,189 --> 00:30:09,317
Oh. You wanted
to save those?

are you doing?

00:30:21,304 --> 00:30:25,035
I just miss him,

Me, too.

00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:30,506
Carl?

483
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,512
Yeah?

484
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:33,014
Wait a minute.
Wait.

485
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,014
What?

486
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,516
Not that one.

487
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:37,018
Which? Oh, I'm sorry.

488
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:39,520
I didn't mean to put
that on there.

489
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:41,022
That's OK.

Hey, Moll,
why don't you come?

491
00:30:43,626 --> 00:30:45,059
It's like summer
outside.

492
00:30:45,128 --> 00:30:48,495
No, I'm really
not up for it.

493
00:30:48,564 --> 00:30:50,464
Just for a walk.

494
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:51,966
I don't want to.

495
00:30:52,034 --> 00:30:54,161
You can't stay in
all day.

496
00:30:54,237 --> 00:30:55,499
It's not healthy.

497
00:30:55,571 --> 00:30:57,596
Carl, I can't do it!

498
00:30:57,673 --> 00:31:00,642
Molly, you're not
the one who died.

499
00:31:02,745 --> 00:31:04,713
I'm sorry.

500
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:06,214
Don't apologize.

Shit.

00:31:12,155 --> 00:31:13,952
Maybe you're right.

503
00:31:14,023 --> 00:31:15,684
Maybe
just a short one.

504
00:31:15,758 --> 00:31:17,783
That a girl.

505
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:21,158
I'm sorry.

506
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,460
Don't worry about it.

00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:24,864
Molly!

508
00:32:24,562 --> 00:32:27,087
What are you
doing here?

509
00:32:27,165 --> 00:32:29,599
You bastard.

00:52:00,689 --> 00:52:02,486
you wouldn't have
raised your voice.

840
00:52:02,558 --> 00:52:03,991
God damn it,
Oda Mae...

841
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,493
Don't you god damn me.

842
00:52:05,561 --> 00:52:07,859
Don't you take
the Lord's name in vain.

843
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:09,192
Would you relax?

844
00:52:09,265 --> 00:52:11,199
You relax.
You're the dead guy.

845
00:52:11,267 --> 00:52:13,201
Want me to help?
You apologize.

846
00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:14,201
Jesus Christ!

847
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:15,396
I'm leaving.

848
00:52:15,471 --> 00:52:17,871
Nobody talks to me like that,
you understand?

849
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,373
Now, you better
apologize.

850
00:52:19,442 --> 00:52:20,875
I'm sorry.

851
00:52:20,943 --> 00:52:21,875
I apologize.

852
00:52:21,944 --> 00:52:23,434
OK?

853
00:52:23,512 --> 00:52:26,276
Now, would you
sit down?

854
00:52:26,348 --> 00:52:27,280
Please?

855
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:29,579
He's apologized.

856
00:52:30,753 --> 00:52:33,688
I need you to tell
Molly what I'm saying,

857
00:52:33,756 --> 00:52:36,691
but you have to tell her
word for word.

858
00:52:36,759 --> 00:52:40,195
Yes. He wants me to tell you
what he's saying

859
00:52:40,262 --> 00:52:42,492
word for word.

860
00:52:47,303 --> 00:52:48,736
Molly, you're in danger.

861
00:52:48,804 --> 00:52:51,739
You can't just
blurt it out like that.

862
00:52:51,807 --> 00:52:53,502
And quit moving around,
will you?

863
00:52:53,576 --> 00:52:55,009
You're making me dizzy.

864
00:52:55,077 --> 00:52:57,602
I'll just tell her
in my own way.

865
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,309
Molly, you in danger,
girl.

866
00:53:01,383 --> 00:53:03,317
What are you
talking about?

867
00:53:03,385 --> 00:53:05,546
I know the man
who killed me.

868
00:53:05,621 --> 00:53:07,088
He knows
who killed him.

869
00:53:07,156 --> 00:53:09,886
His name's Willy Lopez.
I know where he lives.

870
00:53:09,959 --> 00:53:11,893
He's a Puerto Rican,
Willy Lopez.

871
00:53:11,961 --> 00:53:13,326
He knows
where he lives.

872
00:53:13,395 --> 00:53:14,327
Write it down.

873
00:53:14,396 --> 00:53:15,829
You write it down.

874
00:53:15,898 --> 00:53:17,331
I ain't no
damn secretary.

875
00:53:17,399 --> 00:53:18,366
Just do it!

876
00:53:18,434 --> 00:53:19,867
Argh!

877
00:53:19,935 --> 00:53:22,301
He's so testy.

878
00:53:22,371 --> 00:53:25,363
What is it you
want me to write?

879
00:53:25,441 --> 00:53:28,239
It's 303 Prospect Place,
apartment 4-D.

880
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:29,743
303 Prospect Place?

881
00:53:29,812 --> 00:53:30,744
Yeah.

882
00:53:30,813 --> 00:53:32,906
That's my
neighborhood.

883
00:53:32,982 --> 00:53:34,916
Molly, he's got
my wallet,

884
00:53:34,984 --> 00:53:36,417
he's got my key,

885
00:53:36,485 --> 00:53:37,918
and he was
in here.

886
00:53:37,987 --> 00:53:41,252
He's got his wallet
and key and was here.

887
00:53:41,323 --> 00:53:43,257
Yesterday after your
walk with Carl,

888
00:53:43,325 --> 00:53:45,759
you talked to Floyd,
took off your clothes...

889
00:53:45,828 --> 00:53:47,261
All right,
all right.

890
00:53:47,329 --> 00:53:49,627
When you came in
after your walk with Carl,

891
00:53:49,698 --> 00:53:51,666
he saw
everything.

892
00:53:51,734 --> 00:53:54,168
Go to the police.
It was a setup.

893
00:53:54,236 --> 00:53:56,204
I was murdered.

894
00:53:56,272 --> 00:53:59,264
He says go to the police.
He was murdered.

895
00:53:59,341 --> 00:54:00,808
There's somebody
else involved...

896
00:54:00,876 --> 00:54:03,709
I don't want no more
to do with this.

897
00:54:03,779 --> 00:54:05,212
Where are you going?

898
00:54:05,281 --> 00:54:08,216
I'm leaving, I did everything
I said I'd do.

899
00:54:08,284 --> 00:54:10,411
And don't be
following me.

900
00:54:10,486 --> 00:54:12,386
I'm finished.
I mean it.

901
00:54:12,454 --> 00:54:14,888
Have a nice life.
Have a nice death.

902
00:54:14,957 --> 00:54:15,981
Goodbye.

903
00:54:18,561 --> 00:54:21,052
Molly, there is no one
on earth besides you

904
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:24,327
who wants this
to be true more than me,

905
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,766
but you got to be
rational about this.

906
00:54:26,835 --> 00:54:29,963
Sam is no more
in this room than...

907
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:35,636
Look, I understand the
need to hang on to him,

908
00:54:35,711 --> 00:54:38,680
I really do,
but this is absurd.

909
00:54:38,747 --> 00:54:42,808
I know this seems absurd,
but it had to be real.

910
00:54:42,885 --> 00:54:44,819
You believed some
fortune-teller from Brooklyn

911
00:54:44,887 --> 00:54:46,912
who shows up
at your door?

912
00:54:46,989 --> 00:54:49,924
I watched her have
a conversation with him.

913
00:54:49,992 --> 00:54:52,153
I don't buy it, Moll,
not for a minute.

914
00:54:52,228 --> 00:54:54,526
What about the things
she knew?

915
00:54:54,597 --> 00:54:56,155
What things?

916
00:54:56,232 --> 00:55:00,168
The photo Sam took of me
on our trip to Reno.

917
00:55:00,236 --> 00:55:01,999
Carl, we were alone.

918
00:55:02,071 --> 00:55:05,472
And the green underwear
that I wrote my name in.

919
00:55:08,677 --> 00:55:11,202
She said Sam knew
who killed him.

920
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,647
Yeah, that he
was set up.

921
00:55:14,717 --> 00:55:16,685
This is getting
deranged.

922
00:55:16,752 --> 00:55:18,185
We're off
the deep end.

923
00:55:18,254 --> 00:55:20,484
She had a name
and an address...

924
00:55:20,556 --> 00:55:21,488
Willy Lopez.

925
00:55:21,557 --> 00:55:23,991
303 Prospect Place,
apartment 4-D.

926
00:55:25,361 --> 00:55:26,794
This is sick.

927
00:55:26,862 --> 00:55:28,352
Oh, Carl.

928
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:30,398
This is really sick.

929
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,524
Oh, God.

930
00:55:32,601 --> 00:55:34,034
Molly, I don't
understand

931
00:55:34,103 --> 00:55:36,037
how you could...
you could...

932
00:55:38,607 --> 00:55:40,541
swallow this crap.
I mean...

933
00:55:40,609 --> 00:55:43,043
this guy
may not even exist.

934
00:55:43,112 --> 00:55:46,047
Maybe she's just
trying to use you

935
00:55:46,115 --> 00:55:48,709
to set someone up.

936
00:55:48,784 --> 00:55:50,809
You're right.

937
00:55:50,886 --> 00:55:52,319
You're absolutely right.

938
00:55:52,388 --> 00:55:55,323
That's what
I got to find out.

939
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,825
What do you mean,
find out?

940
00:55:57,893 --> 00:56:01,226
She said Sam wants me
to go to the police.

941
00:56:01,297 --> 00:56:03,731
Sam wants you to
go to the police?

942
00:56:03,799 --> 00:56:06,563
Jesus, Moll. Are you
out of your mind?

943
00:56:06,635 --> 00:56:09,069
What are you going
to tell the police?

944
00:56:09,138 --> 00:56:10,571
That some
storefront psychic

945
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:13,073
has been communing
with the dead?

946
00:56:13,142 --> 00:56:15,576
Do you know what
that sounds like?

947
00:56:15,644 --> 00:56:18,078
You're talking ghosts here,
for Christ's sake.

948
00:56:19,748 --> 00:56:20,680
I'm sorry.

949
00:56:20,749 --> 00:56:23,513
This stuff just really
gets to me,

950
00:56:23,585 --> 00:56:24,517
you know?

951
00:56:24,586 --> 00:56:27,020
It's OK if you
don't believe me.

952
00:56:27,089 --> 00:56:28,522
I'm trying to, Molly.

953
00:56:32,127 --> 00:56:33,719
Look...

954
00:56:33,796 --> 00:56:36,731
if it'll make you
feel any better,

955
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:41,031
I'll go check
this out, OK?

956
00:56:41,103 --> 00:56:44,038
I want you to try
and get some sleep.

957
00:56:44,106 --> 00:56:45,038
OK?

958
00:56:45,107 --> 00:56:46,972
All right.

959
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:50,044
I'll call you
in the morning.

960
00:56:50,112 --> 00:56:51,044
OK.

961
00:57:19,179 --> 00:57:20,373
Be careful.

962
00:57:30,524 --> 00:57:32,458
[Knock Knock]

963
00:57:34,161 --> 00:57:35,093
Carl.

964
00:57:35,162 --> 00:57:38,097
What the hell
are you doing here?

965
00:57:39,366 --> 00:57:41,300
Who you been
talking to, Willy?

966
00:57:41,368 --> 00:57:43,802
"Talking to"?
What the hell do you mean?

967
00:57:43,871 --> 00:57:46,135
Some woman knows
all about you, everything.

968
00:57:46,206 --> 00:57:48,140
Where's she
getting it from?

969
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:50,642
I haven't said
a word to anybody.

970
00:57:50,711 --> 00:57:53,145
She knows your name
and where you live.

971
00:57:53,213 --> 00:57:55,613
A lot of women
know where I live.

972
00:57:55,683 --> 00:57:57,617
This is not a joke.

973
00:57:57,685 --> 00:57:59,619
She knows
about the murder.

974
00:57:59,687 --> 00:58:02,247
I want you
to find this bitch,

975
00:58:02,323 --> 00:58:03,756
whoever she is,

976
00:58:03,824 --> 00:58:05,758
and I want you to...

977
00:58:07,628 --> 00:58:10,062
Just get rid
of her, OK?

978
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:14,567
I've got $4 million stuck
in a god damn computer.

979
00:58:14,635 --> 00:58:17,069
If I don't get
those codes,

980
00:58:17,137 --> 00:58:20,072
if that money is not
transferred soon...

981
00:58:22,676 --> 00:58:24,303
I'm...

982
00:58:24,378 --> 00:58:25,402
dead.

983
00:58:25,479 --> 00:58:26,912
We're both dead.

984
00:58:26,981 --> 00:58:29,347
Why not tell them
you only launder money

985
00:58:29,416 --> 00:58:30,849
the first of the month?

986
00:58:30,918 --> 00:58:32,749
What the hell
is wrong with you?

987
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:35,311
Is everything a joke?

988
00:58:35,389 --> 00:58:37,084
You killed a man.

989
00:58:37,157 --> 00:58:38,249
You were supposed
to steal his wallet.

990
00:58:38,325 --> 00:58:40,691
- Was that a joke?
- I did you a favor.

991
00:58:40,761 --> 00:58:42,194
That was a freebie.

992
00:58:43,397 --> 00:58:46,525
Look, these are
drug dealers, OK?

993
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,034
Just don't blow this
for me.

994
00:58:49,103 --> 00:58:51,970
I've risked my job.
I could go to jail.

995
00:58:52,039 --> 00:58:55,304
$80,000 of that money
is mine.

996
00:58:58,512 --> 00:58:59,911
Look, just...

997
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,710
let me have the key
to Sam's apartment.

998
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:05,479
I'll get the address book
myself, OK?

999
00:59:31,278 --> 00:59:33,644
You god damn bastard!

1000
00:59:33,714 --> 00:59:34,772
Why?

1001
00:59:34,848 --> 00:59:37,408
Why? You were
my friend!

1002
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:42,145
I had a life,
god damn you.

1003
00:59:42,222 --> 00:59:43,917
I had a life!

1004
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:56,200
Look, I don't even believe
in this stuff myself.

1005
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:57,703
But she was real.

1006
00:59:57,771 --> 01:00:01,537
You think I'd come down here
if it wasn't real?

1007
01:00:02,776 --> 01:00:03,743
You know,

1008
01:00:03,811 --> 01:00:07,212
you told me if I had
any new information

1009
01:00:07,281 --> 01:00:08,714
that I should come.

1010
01:00:08,782 --> 01:00:10,215
So here I am.

1011
01:00:14,354 --> 01:00:16,288
I know
how this sounds.

1012
01:00:16,356 --> 01:00:18,290
I hear myself
saying it,

1013
01:00:18,358 --> 01:00:20,292
and I want
to cringe.

1014
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,329
But this woman knew things
she couldn't have known.

1015
01:00:23,397 --> 01:00:25,831
Things Sam
only said to me.

1016
01:00:25,899 --> 01:00:28,993
OK, according to this
psychic lady,

1017
01:00:29,069 --> 01:00:33,506
there are ghosts and spirits
all over the place

1018
01:00:33,574 --> 01:00:35,508
watching us
all the time?

1019
01:00:35,576 --> 01:00:36,508
Huh?

1020
01:00:39,213 --> 01:00:42,148
Hell, I'm never going
to get undressed again.

1021
01:00:42,216 --> 01:00:43,148
Excuse me.

1022
01:00:43,217 --> 01:00:46,152
I got more
important things to do.

1023
01:00:56,930 --> 01:00:59,364
The guy's name
is Willy Lopez.

1024
01:00:59,433 --> 01:01:02,869
All I'm asking you to do
is check it out.

1025
01:01:02,936 --> 01:01:04,369
OK. Wait here.

1026
01:01:04,438 --> 01:01:08,135
Let me see if the guy's
got a record, all right?

1027
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:09,937
Great.

1028
01:02:12,506 --> 01:02:13,996
What are you doing?

1029
01:02:14,074 --> 01:02:16,167
Where's the file
on Willy Lopez?

1030
01:02:16,243 --> 01:02:17,676
There isn't one.

1031
01:02:17,744 --> 01:02:19,678
He was probably
some old boyfriend

1032
01:02:19,746 --> 01:02:22,180
she was trying
to get even with.

1033
01:02:22,249 --> 01:02:24,183
This psychic woman's
got a record

1034
01:02:24,251 --> 01:02:26,685
that goes back
a long way.

Look,
this is impossible.

1043
01:02:44,705 --> 01:02:46,969
It goes on and on.

1044
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,974
She knew things,
private things.

1045
01:02:49,042 --> 01:02:51,567
Now, how could she
have known all that?

1046
01:02:51,645 --> 01:02:54,079
A lot of times
they read the obits.

1047
01:02:54,147 --> 01:02:57,480
She just had to see
the word "banker"...boom.

1048

Hell, they even go
through your... garbage

1049
01:03:00,053 --> 01:03:02,180
to find things
they can use...

1050
01:03:02,256 --> 01:03:03,689
letters, old papers.

1051
01:03:03,757 --> 01:03:05,190
It doesn't take much.

1052
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:07,192
No.

1053
01:03:09,396 --> 01:03:10,829
It was real.

1054
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,659
She knew about a...

1055
01:03:15,736 --> 01:03:17,169
a sweater I knitted.

I know this is hard.

People want so much
to believe.

1061
01:03:36,556 --> 01:03:37,488
They're grieving,

1062
01:03:37,557 --> 01:03:38,819
they're vulnerable...

1063
01:03:40,227 --> 01:03:42,422
and they will
give anything

1064
01:03:42,496 --> 01:03:43,929
for one last moment.

1065

Believe me.

These people know
what they're doing.

you can press charges.

You were never

kind of absorb
everything.

I went to the police.

You did?

01:09:13,163 --> 01:09:15,097
Wow. What
did you tell them?

1164
01:09:15,165 --> 01:09:16,598
What did they say?

1165
01:09:16,667 --> 01:09:18,100
It was awful.

1166
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:21,304
I felt really stupid.

1167
01:09:21,372 --> 01:09:24,773
They brought out a file
on this woman and...

1168
01:09:24,842 --> 01:09:26,776
At least
10 inches thick.

1169
01:09:27,911 --> 01:09:29,469
A ripoff artist, huh?

1170
01:09:29,546 --> 01:09:30,672
No, Molly.

1171
01:09:32,383 --> 01:09:34,317
You know,
the sad thing...

1172
01:09:36,053 --> 01:09:37,987
is that
I believed her.

1173
01:09:38,055 --> 01:09:39,488
Molly...

1174
01:09:41,492 --> 01:09:43,653
sometimes
we need to believe.

1175
01:09:45,095 --> 01:09:46,528
Why? What's the point?

1176
01:09:46,597 --> 01:09:50,328
Molly, it's not easy to face
the realities of life sometimes.

1177
01:09:50,401 --> 01:09:52,494
You got to
give yourself that.

1178
01:09:52,569 --> 01:09:57,268
What you've got to remember
is the love that you guys felt.

1179
01:09:57,341 --> 01:09:59,775
You got to remember
how good Sam was.

1180
01:09:59,843 --> 01:10:02,277
You were everything
to him, Molly.

1181
01:10:02,346 --> 01:10:03,779
You were his life.

1182
01:10:18,462 --> 01:10:19,895
I feel so alone.

1183
01:10:28,436 --> 01:10:29,869
You're not alone.

1184
01:10:29,938 --> 01:10:30,870
OK?

1185
01:10:32,073 --> 01:10:34,598
You got your work.
You're incredibly talented.

1186
01:10:34,676 --> 01:10:35,643
You're young.

1187
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:38,008
You're fantastically
gorgeous.

1188
01:10:39,614 --> 01:10:42,048
I don't know
what's real anymore.

1189
01:10:43,118 --> 01:10:45,712
I don't know
what to think.

1190
01:10:48,957 --> 01:10:50,652
Just think about Sam.

1191
01:10:53,194 --> 01:10:56,061
Think about the time
you guys had together.

1192
01:10:57,299 --> 01:10:59,130
How wonderful that was.

1193
01:11:00,502 --> 01:11:01,730
Yeah.

1194
01:11:02,904 --> 01:11:05,896
Let your feelings out,
Moll. It's OK.

1195
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:08,374
Life turns on a dime.

1196
01:11:09,911 --> 01:11:10,935
You know?

1197
01:11:12,547 --> 01:11:13,571
I mean...

1198
01:11:14,716 --> 01:11:16,240
people think that...

1199
01:11:16,318 --> 01:11:19,412
they're there forever, that there's
always going to be tomorrow,

1200
01:11:19,487 --> 01:11:20,920
but that's bullshit.

1201
01:11:20,989 --> 01:11:22,980
Sam taught us that.

1202
01:11:24,326 --> 01:11:26,760
You have to
live for now.

1203
01:11:29,297 --> 01:11:30,491
For today.

1204
01:11:50,518 --> 01:11:51,450
I can't.

1205
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:52,451
I'm sorry.

1206
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,452
It's OK.

1207
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:56,183
L... l... I can't.
It's just too soon.

1208
01:11:56,257 --> 01:11:57,189
It's OK.

1209
01:11:57,258 --> 01:11:59,158
You've been great,
Carl.

1210
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:04,264
But I need you
to leave.

1211
01:12:04,332 --> 01:12:05,731
I understand totally.

1212
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:06,732
Please.

1213
01:12:12,307 --> 01:12:15,606
Could we just have dinner
tomorrow night? Just talk?

1214
01:12:15,677 --> 01:12:18,111
Can I interest you
in that?

1215
01:12:19,347 --> 01:12:20,405
Yeah.

1216
01:12:20,482 --> 01:12:21,414
Sure.

1217
01:12:21,483 --> 01:12:22,415
Great.

1218
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:31,651
Hey.

1219
01:13:36,257 --> 01:13:38,691
Get off my train!

1220
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:39,692
No.

1221
01:13:39,761 --> 01:13:41,524
Get off!

1222
01:13:41,596 --> 01:13:42,654
Get off!

1223
01:13:42,731 --> 01:13:43,527
Get off!

1224
01:13:43,598 --> 01:13:44,997
Get off!

1225
01:13:45,066 --> 01:13:46,328
Get off!

1226
01:13:46,401 --> 01:13:47,629
Get out of here!

1227
01:13:47,702 --> 01:13:48,794
Get off!

1228
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:49,802
No.

1229
01:13:49,871 --> 01:13:51,805
Show me
how you do that.

1230
01:13:51,873 --> 01:13:54,205
I'm not leaving
till you teach me.

1231
01:13:54,275 --> 01:13:55,299
Get off!

1232
01:13:55,376 --> 01:13:56,468
No.

1233
01:13:56,544 --> 01:13:57,476
Get off!

1234
01:14:04,652 --> 01:14:07,212
You stubborn asshole.

1235
01:14:07,288 --> 01:14:08,721
Ha ha ha.

1236
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:10,223
What are you doing?

1237
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:12,225
What the hell
are you doing?

1238
01:14:12,293 --> 01:14:13,726
What am I doing?

1239
01:14:13,795 --> 01:14:16,229
You're trying to move it
with your finger.

1240
01:14:16,297 --> 01:14:18,527
You can't push it.
You're dead.

1241
01:14:27,075 --> 01:14:29,009
It's all in your mind.

1242
01:14:29,077 --> 01:14:32,513
The problem with you
is you still think you're real.

1243
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:34,514
You think you're
wearing those clothes?

1244
01:14:34,582 --> 01:14:36,914
You think you're crouched
on that floor?

1245
01:14:36,985 --> 01:14:37,917
Bullshit!

1246
01:14:37,986 --> 01:14:40,420
You ain't got a body
no more, son!

1247
01:14:40,488 --> 01:14:41,921
It's all up here!

1248
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:43,423
You want
to move something,

1249
01:14:43,491 --> 01:14:45,925
you got to move it
with your mind!

1250
01:14:45,994 --> 01:14:47,427
You got to focus!

1251
01:14:47,495 --> 01:14:49,429
How? How do you focus?

1252
01:14:49,497 --> 01:14:52,022
I don't know
how you focus.

1253
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:53,567
You just focus.

1254
01:14:56,871 --> 01:14:58,600
How did you do that?

1255
01:14:58,673 --> 01:15:01,107
You got to take
all your emotions,

1256
01:15:01,176 --> 01:15:03,872
all your anger, all your love,
all your hate,

1257
01:15:03,945 --> 01:15:05,378
and push it way down

1258
01:15:05,446 --> 01:15:07,209
into the pit
of your stomach

1259
01:15:07,282 --> 01:15:09,716
and let it explode
like a reactor. Pow!

1260
01:15:11,986 --> 01:15:12,918
OK.

1261
01:15:12,987 --> 01:15:13,919
OK.

1262
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:20,452
Don't laugh.

1263
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:46,744
Way to go, kid.

1264
01:15:46,821 --> 01:15:48,254
I did it.

1265
01:15:49,924 --> 01:15:51,448
I did it.

1266
01:15:51,526 --> 01:15:52,959
Way to go.

1267
01:15:59,968 --> 01:16:02,903
From your gut,
like I told you.

1268
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,775
Give it time.
What else have you got?

1269
01:16:16,351 --> 01:16:18,785
How long
have you been here?

1270
01:16:20,955 --> 01:16:23,219
Since they pushed me.

1271
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:24,724
Someone pushed you?

1272
01:16:24,792 --> 01:16:26,123
Yeah, someone pushed me.

1273
01:16:26,194 --> 01:16:27,525
Who?

1274
01:16:27,595 --> 01:16:29,028
You don't believe me?

1275
01:16:29,097 --> 01:16:31,964
You think I fell?
You think I jumped?

1276
01:16:32,033 --> 01:16:33,466
Well, fuck you!

1277
01:16:33,534 --> 01:16:35,229
It wasn't my time!

1278
01:16:35,303 --> 01:16:37,237
I wasn't supposed to go!

1279
01:16:37,305 --> 01:16:39,739
I'm not supposed
to be here!

1280
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:43,971
Oh.

1281
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:46,472
Oh.

1282
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:53,005
Oh, I'd give anything
for a drag.

1283
01:16:53,138 --> 01:16:55,402
Just one drag.

1284
01:16:55,474 --> 01:16:57,237
Are you all right?

1285
01:16:57,309 --> 01:17:00,073
Who are you?
Why are you hounding me?

1286
01:17:00,145 --> 01:17:02,170
Who sent you?

1287
01:17:04,182 --> 01:17:05,979
Who sent you?

1288
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,644
Leave me alone.

1289
01:17:09,721 --> 01:17:11,154
Leave me alone!

1290
01:17:11,223 --> 01:17:13,453
Leave me alone!

1291
01:17:56,802 --> 01:17:57,791
Yes!

1292
01:18:13,285 --> 01:18:14,718
You need
to concentrate,

1293
01:18:14,786 --> 01:18:16,219
'cause if
you concentrate,

1294
01:18:16,288 --> 01:18:17,721
you'll probably
rouse him.

1295
01:18:17,789 --> 01:18:19,222
What's his name
again?

1296
01:18:19,291 --> 01:18:20,223
Orlando.

1297
01:18:20,292 --> 01:18:21,350
Orlando.

1298
01:18:21,426 --> 01:18:24,259
Orlando. Orlando.
Is there an Orlando here?

1299
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:25,261
I'm here.

1300
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:26,262
He's here.

1301
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:27,593
Oda Mae, l...

1302
01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:28,598
Sam.

1303
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:30,100
Excuse me.
I'm Orlando.

1304
01:18:30,168 --> 01:18:31,601
The line's
over there.

1305
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:33,604
Where did these ghosts
come from?

1306
01:18:33,672 --> 01:18:35,105
You can hear them, too?

1307
01:18:35,173 --> 01:18:38,108
I hear them in the morning
and the evening.

1308
01:18:38,176 --> 01:18:39,803
They're coming
into the shower.

1309
01:18:39,878 --> 01:18:42,904
Did you tell every spook
you met about me?

1310
01:18:42,981 --> 01:18:45,643
I got spooks from Jersey
coming in here.

1311
01:18:45,717 --> 01:18:48,481
There's stuff going on
you wouldn't believe.

1312
01:18:48,553 --> 01:18:50,521
It's amazing.
You're really doing it.

1313
01:18:50,589 --> 01:18:51,521
I know.

1314
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:53,421
Can you
hurry this up?

1315
01:18:53,492 --> 01:18:55,619
Oh, chill out.
Chill out.

1316
01:18:55,694 --> 01:18:57,127
I need your help.

1317
01:18:57,195 --> 01:18:59,163
There's something
we need to do.

1318
01:18:59,231 --> 01:19:01,665
I'm not doing anything
else with you, Sam.

1319
01:19:01,733 --> 01:19:03,667
You're holding on
to a life

1320
01:19:03,735 --> 01:19:05,225
that doesn't
want you anymore.

1321
01:19:05,303 --> 01:19:07,533
It doesn't want you.
Give up the ghost.

1322
01:19:07,606 --> 01:19:09,540
Are you speaking
to me?

1323
01:19:09,608 --> 01:19:11,542
Does it look like it?

1324
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:14,238
You're supposed to be
concentrating, aren't you?

1325
01:19:14,312 --> 01:19:15,745
You going to try it?

1326
01:19:15,814 --> 01:19:17,076
Thank you very much.

1327
01:19:17,149 --> 01:19:19,583
Sam, are you going
to get out of here?

1328
01:19:19,651 --> 01:19:20,583
Uh-uh.

1329
01:19:20,652 --> 01:19:22,085
Fine, then stay there.

1330
01:19:22,154 --> 01:19:23,086
Excuse me.

1331
01:19:23,155 --> 01:19:24,087
Excuse me.

1332
01:19:24,156 --> 01:19:25,521
You ready now?

1333
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:27,023
Let's do it.

1334
01:19:27,092 --> 01:19:29,526
I got to talk
to you now.

1335
01:19:29,594 --> 01:19:31,027
I've got a plan.

1336
01:19:31,096 --> 01:19:34,691
All we got to do
is we can...

1337
01:19:34,766 --> 01:19:35,960
Oda Mae?

1338
01:19:42,808 --> 01:19:44,207
Oda Mae.

1339
01:19:46,778 --> 01:19:47,836
Ortisha?

1340
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:51,215
Orlando. Is that you?

1341
01:19:51,283 --> 01:19:54,252
Ortisha, where you at?
I can't hardly see.

1342
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:55,217
Here.
Sh-She's here.

1343
01:19:55,287 --> 01:19:58,688
In front of you.
I'm right here.

1344
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:05,593
Damn, baby, what did
you do to your hair?

1345
01:20:07,632 --> 01:20:09,224
Orlando, you like it?

1346
01:20:09,301 --> 01:20:11,792
It's autumn sunrise.

1347
01:20:14,306 --> 01:20:17,742
Get out of me,
you son of a bitch.

1348
01:20:20,812 --> 01:20:23,576
Don't you ever do that
to me again.

1349
01:20:23,648 --> 01:20:24,842
Orlando?

1350
01:20:24,916 --> 01:20:26,383
Ugh!

1351
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:28,885
I can barely move.

1352
01:20:28,954 --> 01:20:30,751
You should know
better than that.

1353
01:20:30,822 --> 01:20:32,949
Jumping into bodies
wipes you out.

1354
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:33,956
Everybody out.

1355
01:20:34,025 --> 01:20:35,458
What happened
to Orlando?

1356
01:20:35,527 --> 01:20:38,018
Where's
the insurance policy?

1357
01:20:38,096 --> 01:20:39,529
Are you deaf?

1358
01:20:39,598 --> 01:20:41,896
I said everybody out!

1359
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:43,229
Everybody out!

1360
01:20:43,301 --> 01:20:44,734
Get out! Get out!

1361
01:20:44,803 --> 01:20:46,236
Everybody get out!

1362
01:20:58,083 --> 01:20:59,778
Get out.

1363
01:20:59,851 --> 01:21:01,318
You the fortune-teller?

1364
01:21:01,386 --> 01:21:02,819
Who are you?

1365
01:21:02,888 --> 01:21:04,321
That's an interesting
question.

1366
01:21:05,524 --> 01:21:07,151
Why don't you tell me?

1367
01:21:07,225 --> 01:21:08,317
Willy.

1368
01:21:08,393 --> 01:21:09,724
Willy?

1369
01:21:09,794 --> 01:21:11,557
Prospect Place Willy?

1370
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:13,564
Get out of here fast.

1371
01:21:25,343 --> 01:21:27,573
Oda Mae!
Sister! Sister!

1372
01:21:29,214 --> 01:21:31,648
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

1373
01:21:33,852 --> 01:21:36,343
We're in trouble,
so you got to help.

1374
01:21:36,421 --> 01:21:39,356
What do you mean we?
You're already dead.

1375
01:21:39,424 --> 01:21:41,756
These people
are trying to kill me.

1376
01:21:41,826 --> 01:21:43,259
And they'll be back.

1377
01:21:43,328 --> 01:21:46,263
Why don't you just find
a house to haunt?

1378
01:21:46,331 --> 01:21:48,765
Get some chains and
rattle them or something.

1379
01:21:48,833 --> 01:21:51,097
I have a plan,
and it will work,

1380
01:21:51,169 --> 01:21:53,000
but get some
of your fake I.D.s.

1381
01:21:53,071 --> 01:21:54,368
Forget it.

1382
01:21:54,439 --> 01:21:57,806
If you do this, they'll
never bother you again.

1383
01:22:02,914 --> 01:22:04,074
Scout's honor.

1384
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:06,883
All right.

1385
01:22:06,952 --> 01:22:08,715
What do I have to do?

1386
01:22:08,787 --> 01:22:10,778
What exactly
do I have to do?

1387
01:22:12,591 --> 01:22:14,525
You got a nice dress?

1388
01:22:16,806 --> 01:22:20,071
I don't see what's wrong
with what I'm wearing.

1389
01:22:20,143 --> 01:22:23,579
Sorry. I made a joke.
I love your shoes.

1390
01:22:23,646 --> 01:22:26,080
I don't know anything
about banking.

1391
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:28,583
Oda Mae, would
you just relax?

1392
01:22:28,651 --> 01:22:30,084
Listen, I'm nervous.

1393
01:22:30,153 --> 01:22:32,087
I'll get you
through it.

1394
01:22:32,155 --> 01:22:34,623
Your fake driver's
license is great.

1395
01:22:34,691 --> 01:22:38,149
Oh, Sam. I don't think
I should do this.

1396
01:22:38,227 --> 01:22:41,162
Straight ahead.
A stairway that says new accounts.

1397
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:43,164
I ain't giving
them money.

1398
01:22:43,232 --> 01:22:45,223
Do what I say.
Don't talk.

1399
01:22:46,235 --> 01:22:47,668
Tell her you're here

1400
01:22:47,737 --> 01:22:51,173
to fill out a signature
card for a new account.

1401
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:55,609
I'm here to fill out
a signature card for a new account.

1402
01:22:55,678 --> 01:22:57,612
Do you know
your account number?

1403
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,204
926-31043.

1404
01:22:59,282 --> 01:23:00,214
926...

1405
01:23:00,283 --> 01:23:01,215
31043.

1406
01:23:01,284 --> 01:23:03,013
31043.

1407
01:23:04,687 --> 01:23:05,619
Rita Miller.

1408
01:23:05,688 --> 01:23:06,620
Who?

1409
01:23:06,689 --> 01:23:07,621
Rita Miller.

1410
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:08,657
Rita Miller.

1411
01:23:08,725 --> 01:23:10,158
Didn't you sign a card

1412
01:23:10,226 --> 01:23:11,625
when you opened
the account?

1413
01:23:11,694 --> 01:23:14,162
Carl Bruner opened it
for you by phone

1414
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:16,130
and asked you
to come in today.

1415
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:18,963
Carl Bruner opened it
for me by phone.

1416
01:23:19,035 --> 01:23:21,230
Now he's asked me
to come in today.

1417
01:23:22,538 --> 01:23:23,800
Is that right?

1418
01:23:23,873 --> 01:23:25,465
Yeah.

1419
01:23:25,541 --> 01:23:31,411
All right. Just sign this
card on the bottom line, please.

1420
01:23:31,481 --> 01:23:34,416
May I use your pen?
Thank you so much.

1421
01:23:39,722 --> 01:23:41,656
No, no, no!
Rita Miller.

1422
01:23:41,724 --> 01:23:43,954
I'm so sorry.

1423
01:23:44,027 --> 01:23:45,494
You know, I...

1424
01:23:45,561 --> 01:23:48,428
I need another one.
I signed the wrong name.

1425
01:23:53,269 --> 01:23:56,636
Make sure it goes up to
the third floor file

1426
01:23:56,706 --> 01:23:59,140
because you have
a transaction to make.

1427
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:02,143
Make sure this goes
to the third floor file.

1428
01:24:02,211 --> 01:24:04,679
I have a transfusion
to make.

1429
01:24:04,747 --> 01:24:05,679
A what?

1430
01:24:05,748 --> 01:24:07,215
Let's go.

1431
01:24:07,283 --> 01:24:10,650
You know what I mean.
Can I keep this pen?

1432
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,745
Uh... uh,
yes, sure.

1433
01:24:12,822 --> 01:24:14,517
Thank you so much.

1434
01:24:15,591 --> 01:24:18,526
Bye-bye. I just
love these pens.

1435
01:24:18,594 --> 01:24:22,052
What do you want to
keep the pen for?

1436
01:24:22,131 --> 01:24:23,063
[Ring]

1437
01:24:23,132 --> 01:24:24,565
Carl Bruner speaking.

1438
01:24:24,634 --> 01:24:26,067
Hi, Carl.

1439
01:24:26,135 --> 01:24:27,067
Mr. Balistrari.

1440
01:24:27,136 --> 01:24:30,071
Balistrari? Carl,
it's me, John.

1441
01:24:30,139 --> 01:24:34,576
John. John, sorry, um,
what... what... what... what's up?

1442
01:24:34,644 --> 01:24:37,078
I've got the info
on the Bradley portfolio.

1443
01:24:37,146 --> 01:24:38,078
Oh, right.

1444
01:24:38,147 --> 01:24:40,581
I'll pick it up
later, all right?

1445
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:42,345
I'll be here
till 6:00.

1446
01:24:47,246 --> 01:24:51,046
I don't suppose I can
talk you into losing the hat.

1447
01:24:51,117 --> 01:24:52,550
You keep
messing with me,

1448
01:24:52,618 --> 01:24:54,051
you'll be here
by yourself.

1449
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:59,490
Shh. Now tell the guard
you're here to see Lyle Ferguson.

1450
01:24:59,558 --> 01:25:02,493
Hi. I'm here to see
Lyle Ferguson, please.

1451
01:25:02,561 --> 01:25:04,495
Do you have
an appointment?

1452
01:25:04,563 --> 01:25:06,497
No, I'm here
for my health.

1453
01:25:06,565 --> 01:25:08,499
Tell him Rita
Miller's here.

1454
01:25:08,567 --> 01:25:11,001
You... You just tell him
Rita Miller's here.

1455
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:12,002
One moment.

1456
01:25:12,071 --> 01:25:13,003
Don't embellish.

1457
01:25:13,072 --> 01:25:14,630
Jawohl.

1458
01:25:14,707 --> 01:25:16,072
Excuse me?

1459
01:25:19,779 --> 01:25:22,213
Now, listen.
This guy Ferguson's a real jerk.

1460
01:25:22,281 --> 01:25:24,215
I've known him
for five years,

1461
01:25:24,283 --> 01:25:26,217
and he still
thinks my name's...

1462
01:25:26,285 --> 01:25:27,718
Why are you
whispering?

1463
01:25:27,787 --> 01:25:29,880
Just be quiet
and listen.

1464
01:25:29,955 --> 01:25:31,388
He's a social moron.

1465
01:25:31,457 --> 01:25:34,153
Just tell the guard
Ferguson knows you.

1466
01:25:34,226 --> 01:25:37,161
You spent time with him
and his wife Shirley

1467
01:25:37,229 --> 01:25:40,164
at the Brewsters' Christmas
party last year. Got it?

1468
01:25:40,232 --> 01:25:42,325
What is this
in regards to?

1469
01:25:42,401 --> 01:25:44,335
What? He doesn't
remember me?

1470
01:25:44,403 --> 01:25:46,337
Oh, we spent
all that time

1471
01:25:46,405 --> 01:25:49,738
at the Brewsters' Christmas
party last year.

1472
01:25:49,809 --> 01:25:51,242
It was beautiful.

1473
01:25:51,310 --> 01:25:54,279
A big old tree and thousands
of presents everywhere.

1474
01:25:54,346 --> 01:25:55,278
It...

1475
01:25:57,183 --> 01:25:58,707
Gas.

1476
01:25:59,785 --> 01:26:02,720
I get a little gas
from time to time.

1477
01:26:02,788 --> 01:26:04,221
That's all. Gas.

1478
01:26:05,291 --> 01:26:06,690
Quit poking me!

1479
01:26:06,759 --> 01:26:08,192
Well,
don't overdo it.

1480
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:10,194
Now, listen.
This'll be easy.

1481
01:26:10,262 --> 01:26:13,425
Ferguson was so drunk,
he could've had a conversation

1482
01:26:13,499 --> 01:26:15,831
with Tina Turner
and not remember.

1483
01:26:20,039 --> 01:26:21,870
I don't know, Sam.

1484
01:26:21,941 --> 01:26:23,374
Here we go.

1485
01:26:26,779 --> 01:26:27,711
Hello. Hello.

1486
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:29,042
Uh, yes.

1487
01:26:30,716 --> 01:26:32,149
Of course, yes.

1488
01:26:32,218 --> 01:26:34,846
Well, uh, it's been
a... a long time.

1489
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:35,852
Long time.

1490
01:26:35,921 --> 01:26:38,355
Ask how Bobby
and Snooky are doing.

1491
01:26:38,424 --> 01:26:40,358
How are Bobby
and Snooky doing?

1492
01:26:40,426 --> 01:26:42,951
Fine. Fine.
Thank you.

1493
01:26:43,028 --> 01:26:44,461
Thank you
for asking.

1494
01:26:44,530 --> 01:26:49,399
Uh, and how is
your, uh, family?

1495
01:26:49,468 --> 01:26:51,629
Oh, couldn't
be better.

1496
01:26:51,704 --> 01:26:53,228
Well... wonderful.

1497
01:26:53,305 --> 01:26:55,239
Tell him you've
been wondering

1498
01:26:55,307 --> 01:26:57,741
how they did on the
Gibraltar securities.

1499
01:26:57,810 --> 01:26:59,243
I was just wondering,

1500
01:26:59,311 --> 01:27:02,246
how did you do on
the Gibraltar securities?

1501
01:27:02,314 --> 01:27:03,679
The Gibraltar
securities?

1502
01:27:03,749 --> 01:27:07,583
Well, it looks like we topped out
on that one, huh?

1503
01:27:07,653 --> 01:27:08,585
Sure did.

1504
01:27:08,654 --> 01:27:09,586
Sure did.

1505
01:27:09,655 --> 01:27:11,418
That was
a useful tip.

1506
01:27:11,490 --> 01:27:12,718
Good old Randy.

1507
01:27:12,791 --> 01:27:15,692
Good old Randy. Got a
good old head on his shoulders.

1508
01:27:15,761 --> 01:27:16,955
Her shoulders.

1509
01:27:17,029 --> 01:27:18,496
Her shoulders.

1510
01:27:18,564 --> 01:27:19,588
Randy.

1511
01:27:19,665 --> 01:27:22,065
So, what, um...

1512
01:27:22,134 --> 01:27:23,692
what brings you
here today?

1513
01:27:23,769 --> 01:27:25,202
You're closing
an account.

1514
01:27:25,271 --> 01:27:26,738
I'm closing an account.

1515
01:27:26,805 --> 01:27:29,501
Do you have
your account number?

1516
01:27:29,575 --> 01:27:30,507
Yes?

1517
01:27:30,576 --> 01:27:31,508
Yes.

1518
01:27:31,577 --> 01:27:32,509
Yes.

1519
01:27:32,578 --> 01:27:33,510
926-31043.

1520
01:27:33,579 --> 01:27:36,343
926-31043.
Is that right?

1521
01:27:36,415 --> 01:27:37,347
Yeah.

1522
01:27:37,416 --> 01:27:38,713
Good.

1523
01:27:46,792 --> 01:27:50,228
Well, Rita, it looks like
you'll be withdrawing

1524
01:27:50,296 --> 01:27:52,560
$4 million
from us today.

1525
01:27:52,631 --> 01:27:54,064
$4 million!

1526
01:27:54,133 --> 01:27:56,033
Say yes. Say yes!

1527
01:27:56,101 --> 01:27:57,033
Is that correct?

1528
01:27:57,102 --> 01:27:58,034
Yes.

1529
01:27:58,103 --> 01:28:00,594
Yes.
Yes, uh, yes!

1530
01:28:00,673 --> 01:28:02,470
Yes, that's correct.

1531
01:28:02,541 --> 01:28:04,133
Easy, easy.

1532
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:09,375
Yes. Well, how
would you like that?

1533
01:28:09,448 --> 01:28:11,473
10s and 20s.

1534
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:12,482
Pardon?

1535
01:28:12,551 --> 01:28:14,143
Tell him
a cashier's check.

1536
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:16,654
I think better
a cashier's check.

1537
01:28:16,722 --> 01:28:18,553
A cashier's check.
Fine.

1538
01:28:18,624 --> 01:28:20,558
Well, of course,
uh, you know,

1539
01:28:20,626 --> 01:28:22,560
we require identification
from everyone.

1540
01:28:22,628 --> 01:28:24,061
Oh, I see.

1541
01:28:24,129 --> 01:28:25,562
It's just
procedural.

1542
01:28:25,631 --> 01:28:27,292
Yes. I...

1543
01:28:37,076 --> 01:28:38,008
Thank you.

1544
01:28:38,077 --> 01:28:40,705
Well, I'll, uh,
I'll be right back.

1545
01:28:42,414 --> 01:28:43,813
$4 million!

1546
01:28:43,882 --> 01:28:44,814
Shh!

1547
01:28:49,288 --> 01:28:52,724
Yeah, get me the
First Island Bank of Nassau.

1548
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:54,156
It's on the Rolodex.

1549
01:29:03,736 --> 01:29:08,173
Well, we have some, uh,
things for you to sign here.

1550
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:11,175
This officially
closes the account.

1551
01:29:11,243 --> 01:29:13,177
And, uh,
here you are.

1552
01:29:13,245 --> 01:29:14,678
Now sign Rita Miller.

1553
01:29:14,747 --> 01:29:15,907
Mm-hmm.

1554
01:29:17,249 --> 01:29:20,810
Rita Miller.
That's my name.

1555
01:29:20,886 --> 01:29:24,720
My name. Rita Miller.
My name.

1556
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:27,122
That's my name.

1557
01:29:27,192 --> 01:29:28,124
Molly, hi.

1558
01:29:28,193 --> 01:29:29,125
Hi.

1559
01:29:29,194 --> 01:29:32,425
Oda Mae,
I'll be right back.

1560
01:29:32,498 --> 01:29:33,863
Just anywhere?

1561
01:29:33,932 --> 01:29:34,864
Right here.

1562
01:29:34,933 --> 01:29:35,865
Right.

1563
01:29:40,773 --> 01:29:41,933
Fine.

1564
01:29:42,007 --> 01:29:44,373
The, uh, check.

1565
01:29:45,778 --> 01:29:47,712
This, uh...

1566
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:49,543
Here you are.

1567
01:29:49,615 --> 01:29:53,551
The person you need
is right down on the end.

1568
01:29:56,722 --> 01:30:00,658
Mama took the money that
she made in the oil wells,

1569
01:30:00,726 --> 01:30:03,160
and she sunk it
into gas pumps.

1570
01:30:03,228 --> 01:30:06,664
You know, how they have
at the gas station?

1571
01:30:06,732 --> 01:30:08,165
It's very,
very lucrative.

1572
01:30:08,233 --> 01:30:09,165
Oda Mae...

1573
01:30:09,234 --> 01:30:10,667
it really adds up.

1574
01:30:10,736 --> 01:30:12,260
Say goodbye.

1575
01:30:12,338 --> 01:30:14,772
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

1576
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,536
Now, may I keep the pen?

1577
01:30:17,609 --> 01:30:20,703
Say good night to Bobby
and Snooky for me.

1578
01:30:20,779 --> 01:30:21,711
Bye-bye.

1579
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:23,714
Why are you
rushing me?

1580
01:30:28,087 --> 01:30:29,918
What is wrong?

1581
01:30:31,256 --> 01:30:32,450
Oh.

1582
01:30:39,264 --> 01:30:40,697
Excuse me. Lyle?

1583
01:30:40,766 --> 01:30:42,165
Oh, yes. Uh...

1584
01:30:42,234 --> 01:30:43,166
Molly.

1585
01:30:43,235 --> 01:30:44,964
Molly.

1586
01:30:45,037 --> 01:30:47,198
Jensen. The woman you were
just doing business with...

1587
01:30:47,272 --> 01:30:48,204
Yeah?

1588
01:30:48,273 --> 01:30:49,706
What did she want?

1589
01:30:49,775 --> 01:30:52,209
Did it have anything
to do with Sam?

1590
01:30:52,277 --> 01:30:54,575
Sam? Why, no. No.

1591
01:30:54,646 --> 01:30:57,080
That was Oda Mae Brown,
right?

1592
01:30:57,149 --> 01:30:59,083
No. Her name
was Rita Miller.

1593
01:30:59,151 --> 01:31:00,982
She was closing
an account.

1594
01:31:01,053 --> 01:31:02,350
Is there a problem?

1595
01:31:03,722 --> 01:31:07,180
No, I guess not.
Thank you.

1596
01:31:36,655 --> 01:31:39,180
Carl,
is something wrong?

1597
01:31:39,258 --> 01:31:41,692
Is somebody playing
with the computers?

1598
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:42,692
What?

1599
01:31:42,761 --> 01:31:44,695
One of my accounts
is closed.

1600
01:31:44,763 --> 01:31:46,196
Which account?
What's wrong?

1601
01:31:46,265 --> 01:31:48,699
You want me
to call someone?

1602
01:31:48,767 --> 01:31:50,200
No, it's OK.

1603
01:31:50,269 --> 01:31:52,294
I can do it.
I got it.

1604
01:31:55,507 --> 01:31:56,940
$4 million!

1605
01:31:57,009 --> 01:32:00,206
What am I going to
do with this money?

1606
01:32:00,279 --> 01:32:02,213
I'm going
to buy the block.

1607
01:32:02,281 --> 01:32:06,217
I'm going to make my sister
go to a fat farm.

1608
01:32:06,285 --> 01:32:08,719
I'm going to
buy the building.

1609
01:32:08,787 --> 01:32:10,220
I've got an idea.

1610
01:32:10,289 --> 01:32:11,221
Please donate.

1611
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:14,014
Take the check
out of your purse.

1612
01:32:14,147 --> 01:32:17,514
Right. I should put it
where nobody can get it.

1613
01:32:17,584 --> 01:32:19,017
No. No. Endorse it.

1614
01:32:19,085 --> 01:32:22,020
If I endorse it,
then if I drop it,

1615
01:32:22,088 --> 01:32:23,521
somebody will get it.

1616
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:26,616
I never said you were
going to get the money.

1617
01:32:26,693 --> 01:32:29,526
It's blood money.
I was killed for this money.

1618
01:32:29,596 --> 01:32:31,029
Now,
endorse the check.

1619
01:32:31,097 --> 01:32:33,657
What are you going
to do with it?

1620
01:32:35,235 --> 01:32:36,702
Look over there.

1621
01:32:36,770 --> 01:32:39,330
To your left.

1622
01:32:41,574 --> 01:32:44,873
You don't think
I'm giving this $4 million

1623
01:32:44,945 --> 01:32:46,879
to a bunch of nuns.

1624
01:32:46,947 --> 01:32:49,381
If you don't,
they'll track you down.

1625
01:32:49,449 --> 01:32:50,882
Get rid of it.

1626
01:32:50,951 --> 01:32:52,509
Sam,
you're killing me!

1627
01:32:52,585 --> 01:32:54,018
It's $4 million!

1628
01:32:54,087 --> 01:32:55,452
You'll go to heaven.

1629
01:32:55,522 --> 01:32:57,956
I don't want
to go to heaven.

1630
01:32:58,024 --> 01:33:00,356
I want to
cash the check.

1631
01:33:03,463 --> 01:33:04,395
Hello.

1632
01:33:04,464 --> 01:33:05,897
You'll thank me
later.

1633
01:33:05,966 --> 01:33:07,524
How are you
doing?

1634
01:33:09,235 --> 01:33:11,203
Now, endorse it
"Rita Miller."

1635
01:33:11,271 --> 01:33:12,203
I know.

1636
01:33:12,272 --> 01:33:15,207
Make it out
to St. Joseph's shelter.

1637
01:33:15,275 --> 01:33:18,210
I can't believe
you're making me do this.

1638
01:33:23,249 --> 01:33:25,183
Now give it to her.

1639
01:33:25,251 --> 01:33:27,685
I want to feel it
one more time.

1640
01:33:27,754 --> 01:33:29,688
Give the lady
the check.

1641
01:33:29,756 --> 01:33:30,688
I will!

1642
01:33:32,258 --> 01:33:33,748
Hand her the check.

1643
01:33:33,827 --> 01:33:35,886
You can do it.

1644
01:33:37,764 --> 01:33:39,197
Give her the check.

1645
01:33:39,265 --> 01:33:41,256
I will!

1646
01:33:44,004 --> 01:33:46,996
Bless you, child.
Bless you.

1647
01:33:52,779 --> 01:33:54,576
Give it to her.

1648
01:33:54,647 --> 01:33:57,548
Let go. Let go!

1649
01:33:58,651 --> 01:33:59,583

if I could just
touch you once more.

he was alive again

touch you.
