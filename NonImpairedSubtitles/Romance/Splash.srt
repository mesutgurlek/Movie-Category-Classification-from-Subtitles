<i>Uno, dos, one, two, tres, quatro.</i>

00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,866
<i>Hey, wooly bully</i>

3
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,958
<i>Watch it now, watch it</i>

4
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,970
<i>Here it comes
Here it comes</i>

5
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,303
<i>Watch it now
He gets you</i>

6
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,186
<i>Matty told Hatty</i>

7
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:57,746
<i>About a thing she saw</i>

8
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,884
<i>It had two big horns</i>

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,894
<i>And a woolyjaw</i>

10
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:06,056
<i>Wooly bully</i>

11
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:09,590
<i>Wooly bully
That's right</i>

12
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:12,797
<i>Wooly bully, wooly bully</i>

13
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:15,363
<i>Wooly bully</i>

14
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,673
<i>Hatty told Matty</i>

15
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,614
<i>Let's don't take no chance</i>

16
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:26,652
<i>Let's not be L seven</i>

17
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,653
<i>Come and learn to dance</i>

18
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:35,285
<i>Wooly bully</i>

19
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:39,923
<i>Wooly bully, wooly bully
Wooly bully</i>

20
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,399
<i>Watch it now
Watch it, watch it</i>

21
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,405
<i>Hey</i>

22
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,939
<i>Hey, that's right</i>

23
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,804
<i>Right, right, right</i>

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,664
<i>Hey, wooly bully
Watch it now</i>

25
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,467
<i>Here it comes
Here it comes</i>

26
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,779
<i>Matty told Hatty</i>

27
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,120
<i>About a thing she saw...</i>

28
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:42,593
- Freddie!
- I dropped something.

29
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,153
Ralph, talk to him.

30
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,563
Listen to your father.

31
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,660
- From there we can see Cape Cod.
- We were just there!

32
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,535
<i>We could have stayed and saved $ 12.00.</i>

33
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:58,236
Allen, don't you want to see Cape Cod?

34
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,769
You know where we are
if you change your mind.

35
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,557
<i>Allen!</i>

36
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,632
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

37
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,336
Thanks a lot. Thanks.

38
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,861
You okay, Allen? Lend me a towel.

39
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,306
Why did you do that?

40
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,487
Come on, son.

41
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:42,337
<i>Augie, pick up line four, please.</i>

42
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,413
- Where are my cherries?
- Mr. McCulloch,

43
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,358
they came in, but there was a fog...

44
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,225
If I don't get my cherries in 5 minutes,

45
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,323
you don't get your money
and you starve and you die.

46
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,891
Jerry?

47
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,430
- Where are McCulloch's cherries?
- They're here,

48
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,668
but you gotta take a look.

49
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,677
Ah, Mr. McCulloch, be right back.

50
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,236
Where are my cherries?

51
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:19,983
Augie, did you grow these under your arms?

52
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,521
Jesus, snails with stems.
Get them outta here!

53
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,852
- George, get them out of here.
- You got it.

54
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:29,554
Bauer. Thank you. Honey, what's up?

55
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:33,224
We get a lot of rain and cherries get slime.

56
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,063
- I can't hear ya.
- You agreed to take these off our hands.

57
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:39,832
- When the hell did I agree to that?
- Not you, your brother.

58
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,840
Ah, all right.

59
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,842
Victoria, I can't hear you.

60
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,276
What I'm doing is important too.

61
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,280
My brother bought your slimy cherries?

62
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,578
Yeah. We were playing poker.

63
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,641
He had two pair. I had a flush.

64
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,847
He had no cash, so we worked this out.

65
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,098
Who put this goddamn fruit here?

66
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,464
I'm all right, if anyone's concerned.

67
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,060
Good morning, Freddie.

68
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,765
Allen! Allen!

69
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,865
A simple "yes" or "no. "

70
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,604
I made it. I'm in Penthouse magazine.

71
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,908
They printed my letter!

72
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,346
Listen, I'm very happy.

73
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,350
I'm in the Forum section.

74
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,784
The story's entitled, "A Lesbian No More. "

75
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,220
They printed every word.
It's a beautiful story.

76
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,621
I want copies for everybody.

77
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,751
Augie, good to see you!

78
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,761
Great game. We gotta do that more.

79
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,922
- Can we talk?
- Great poker player.

80
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,092
- Cheats like a son of a bitch!
- We have to talk.

81
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,934
- Missing petty cash? It was the cleaning girl.
- I don't care.

82
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,132
You don't? I admit the whole thing.

83
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,368
I still don't care about it.

84
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,139
I love this guy! Do you hear me?

85
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,146
- Gimme a kiss.
- Oh, Freddie.

86
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,273
Too big to kiss your older brother?

87
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,779
I love this guy's head.

88
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,416
Here's a buck. Wash my car.

89
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:09,552
Bauer! Where are my...

90
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,563
Your cherries, yes.

91
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,998
Believe me, you won't be
satisfied with what we have.

92
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:18,298
You're ruined! Everyone's gonna know
you left me dry.

93
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,430
You're finished, a ghost.

94
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,407
- How'd you like bananas at cost?
- Deal!

95
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,240
Set up our friend with bananas at cost.

96
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,372
Allen, wait. I've got to get out early.

97
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,247
Gee, right. Today's the big day.

98
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,616
Ushers have to be early too.

99
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,621
- I'll be there.
- Okay.

100
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:42,418
<i>Will someone
get those Jonathans off the truck?</i>

101
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,595
Any messages, Mrs. Stimler?

102
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,100
Yes.

103
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,705
What are they?

104
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:57,800
Huh? Oh,

105
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:01,142
your father wants you to call him back.

106
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:05,617
Mrs. Stimler, our father
passed away five years ago.

107
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,779
- Remember?
- Right.

108
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,984
Should I get him for you?

109
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:16,119
No, no. We'll... I'll take care of it.

110
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,789
You just get back to work.

111
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:29,137
- What's with her?
- A little accident over the weekend.

112
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,006
Got hit in the head by some lightning.

113
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,913
It's not funny, Freddie!

114
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,883
I'm sorry. That's not funny.

115
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:42,011
Besides, she can still do certain things.

116
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,522
Like jump-start a car?

117
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,582
Jump-start a car!

118
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,026
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

119
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:53,588
- What the hell are you doing down here?
- Maybe I went...

120
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,897
- to the "Club A" last night.
- Something new for you.

121
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,767
Maybe I met Mr. Buyrite,
owner of Buyrite Markets.

122
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,467
Maybe we had a few drinks.

123
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,875
And maybe, just maybe...

124
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,970
we're his new produce suppliers.

125
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,710
I'm proud of you.
That's great! Which store?

126
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:15,447
Not which store, the whole chain.

127
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:18,786
I hope you are joking with me.

128
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,291
Think big, be big.

129
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,589
He was a colonel. I made up a story...

130
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,130
about you being wounded in Nam
and he wants to do business.

131
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,222
He's coming this morning.

132
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,792
Great, Freddie. It's only chaos down here.

133
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,805
- Augie brings me slimy cherries.
- So what?

134
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:37,502
- Jerry's getting married tomorrow.
- So what?

135
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,772
I was drinking with this bum all night.

136
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:43,008
- I'm busting my buns.
- East 77 th Street.

137
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,711
- Come on, you can handle this deal.
- Yeah, I'll handle it.

138
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:50,517
- Your desk looks like a pigsty.
- I have a system.

139
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,854
<i>Phone for you.</i>

140
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,827
Yes? All right. Thank you.

141
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,989
Hi, Victoria. I'm sorry.

142
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,999
I forgot to call you back.

143
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,695
What's the matter?
Your voice sounds funny.

144
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,260
What? Now?

145
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,706
<i>You're moving out of the apartment now?</i>

146
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,642
<i>While we're talking?</i>

147
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:16,204
Yeah, I know we were going to talk about it.

148
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:20,013
Victoria, this is a little impulsive.

149
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:23,021
If we were married you
wouldn't move out like this.

150
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,455
- She might. Sure.
- Get off!

151
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,719
- Was that you?
- Get off the phone!

152
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,318
- I'm so sorry!
- Not you.

153
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,024
Why not tell a guy you're on the phone?

154
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,035
What do you mean, "Do I love you?"

155
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,336
Well, I...

156
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:45,343
Well, we met and...

157
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,977
You moved in, didn't you?

158
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,853
Well, it's... it's just a very
complicated thing.

159
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,685
Hey, do you love me?

160
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,818
Well, there you go.

161
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,532
There she went.

162
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,904
<i>What a huge wedding.</i>

163
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,672
Cindy, hi.

164
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:25,044
- How are you?
- How are you?

165
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,210
Excuse me.

166
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,516
<i>You look so pretty!</i>

167
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:36,052
Darn! My flash never works!

168
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,995
Figures. My mother-in-law gave it to me.

169
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,062
- Get up!
- What? What?

170
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,605
It was embarrassing when you were 10.

171
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,301
If something works for me,
I stick with it!

172
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,968
I've been thinking.

173
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,740
I intend to get more involved with business.

174
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:58,147
I mean that this time. I know the business.

175
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,186
I was there at the beginning with Dad.

176
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:05,383
Do we sell fruit and
vegetables or just fruit?

177
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,394
By the time I came home,
she was already gone.

178
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,794
- Victoria left, huh?
- Yeah.

179
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,560
You know why she left me?

180
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,932
- Because I didn't love her.
- That bitch.

181
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:22,201
Hi. Anywhere but the first three rows.

182
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,503
- Anywhere but the first three rows.
- Hey!

183
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,411
Hi, Freddie. Allen, where's Victoria?

184
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,814
She's sick, and she can't make it.

185
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,614
- I'm sorry.
- Hey!

186
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,888
Can you answer me
why I didn't love her, Freddie?

187
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,893
She had everything.

188
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,623
She was bright, sensitive, beautiful.

189
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,995
- Hey, Allen!
- Hi.

190
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:52,231
- Where's Victoria?
- She can't make it because of the flu.

191
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,829
- Give her my love.
- You bet! Sure.

192
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,502
I can't even give her my love!

193
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:02,138
Something in here is not working.

194
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,774
There are worse organs
not to be working. Ha!

195
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,115
Hi, guys. Bauer, where's your pretty lady?

196
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,121
She's not coming! Okay?

197
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,589
Do you want your money back?

198
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:18,055
Well, I don't know. Maybe it's for the best.

199
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,327
- Hey, Allen.
- She left me! My life's a shambles.

200
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,425
That's the news. Want the weather?

201
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,993
Anywhere but the first three rows!

202
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,298
Lighten up on the guy.
That's the bride's brother.

203
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,140
Drinking is a matter
of algebraic ratios.

204
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:40,010
How drunk you get depends on
how much alcohol you consume...

205
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:43,213
in relation to your total body weight.

206
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,382
It's not that you had too much to drink,

207
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,017
it's that you're too skinny!

208
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,254
- Marceau, more drinks here.
- No.

209
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:54,197
- Freddie, I don't want to get drunk.
- But you are.

210
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,757
A sober person would have
reached for the pretzels.

211
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,566
- Is he going to be there long?
- I don't know.

212
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:03,335
- Oh, I'm on the bar.
- You're on the bar.

213
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,434
Come on, off the bar.

214
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,344
This stool is in your way. Let me move it.

215
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,405
Oh, oh, you fell.

216
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:15,310
That hurt. You're not having a good day.

217
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,322
- Wasn't that a beautiful wedding?
- That was.

218
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,848
It was. It really was.

219
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,021
- The most gorgeous ceremony...
- A lovely...

220
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,499
- How ya doing?
- Fine.

221
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,593
The fabulous Freddie Bauer here.

222
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,003
- Where did you get those?
- My grandmother.

223
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,770
- She left them to me.
- She did?

224
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,311
- They're beautiful.
- Thank you.

225
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,074
Hi.

226
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,240
- Hi.
- Hi.

227
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,716
You guys are in love, aren't you?

228
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,844
We just met.

229
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:52,254
That doesn't matter.
I know about these things.

230
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,485
I can see. I can tell.

231
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,721
You two guys, you're in love.

232
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,161
I think that's beautiful.

233
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,825
Thanks.

234
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,168
I don't live too far.

235
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,675
Let's go to my place for a quiet drink.

236
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:14,577
Do I expect too much out of life?

237
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,639
My dress! I can't believe this.

238
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,685
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, what are you doing?

239
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,654
Both of you. You're both crazy!

240
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,656
I'm sorry. Look...

241
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,988
I don't ask that much, do I?

242
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,153
I don't ask to be famous, rich,

243
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:34,131
or play center field for the Yankees.

244
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,963
I just want to meet a woman...

245
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,596
and fall in love, and get married.

246
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,765
And I want to have a kid,

247
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,570
and I want to see him play
a tooth in the school play.

248
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,611
It's not much.

249
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,807
But I'm kidding myself.

250
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,248
It's never going to happen.

251
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,752
I'm going to grow old...

252
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,085
and grow lonely, and I'm gonna die;

253
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:02,150
and I'll be surrounded
by a bunch of rotten fruit.

254
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,196
- Freddie?
- No kidding!

255
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,892
Freddie?

256
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,194
Allen! I want you to meet
some friends of mine.

257
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,796
This is Tawny, and this is Jill.

258
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,807
- I'm Tawny.
- You're Tawny Tiger!

259
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,469
And this is Jill, a four-letter word.

260
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,479
- My brother, Allen.
- Hi.

261
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,482
- Freddie, can I talk to you?
- Absolutely.

262
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,484
Excuse me.

263
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,884
I'll be right back.
We'll whisper some more.

264
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,354
I've got some whispering for you!

265
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,357
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

266
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,326
Pack your bags. We're going to Rio!

267
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,693
They have a timesharing condominium.

268
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,699
We're gonna share some time with them.

269
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,826
No, I'm going to Cape Cod.

270
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,927
What are you talking about?

271
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,939
Why would you go to Cape Cod?

272
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,601
Because I like Cape Cod.

273
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,610
I feel better up there.

274
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,442
I look at the water
and feel closer to something.

275
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,779
- Cape Cod over Rio? Are you all right?
- Yeah.

276
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,287
- Let me drive you up there.
- No, no.

277
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,288
- You got enough money?
- I've got plenty.

278
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,756
- Yeah?
- Thanks.

279
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,759
Can I have some then?

280
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,565
- Where to?
- Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

281
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,376
You break that, you pay for it.

282
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,380
Well, I'm sorry. I usually enjoy...

283
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,643
smashing the glass with my face.

284
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,710
That's about 300 miles.
You got the cash?

285
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,450
What is this?

286
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,503
Careful with that.

287
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,514
Be careful with that!

288
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,073
What do you think you're loading?

289
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:09,518
This is delicate scientific equipment.

290
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,650
Hold it. Put it down. You see that?
It says, "This end up. "

291
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,126
Know what that means? This end up!

292
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,495
Why don't you try holding that end up?

293
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,434
All right, get away!

294
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:27,268
I'll do it myself. Get away. Give me a hand.

295
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,142
Easy.

296
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,148
- Move that...
- Excuse me.

297
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,183
- Morning.
- Morning.

298
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,187
Ah,

299
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,985
I was dropped off on
the wrong side of the beach.

300
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,549
Could you take me over to the island?

301
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,320
Well, ah, we're not...

302
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,331
We're not going...

303
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,562
We're taking the boat.
We're not going out there!

304
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,128
Have you seen anyone else
along this beach?

305
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,004
No, just me and the moron twins.

306
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,704
We're not twins.

307
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,416
- What is all this stuff?
- I knew it!

308
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,647
Who sent you up here?
Dr. Ross from Chicago?

309
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,848
Who's Dr. Ross from Chicago?

310
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,154
Who's Dr. Ross? You're very good.

311
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,626
I suppose you're some
harmless beachcomber...

312
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,493
who happens to wear a tuxedo!

313
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,227
How dare you try and horn in
on someone else's research!

314
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,235
I'm just a guy...

315
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,669
Walter Kornbluth is not
to be taken advantage of.

316
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:37,903
Just stay out of my way, sonny.

317
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,679
All right, let's move out!

318
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:51,683
A guy down the beach
runs people out to the island.

319
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,918
What's the name?

320
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,926
The guy or the island?

321
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,360
I'll find him.

322
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,632
What's the matter? You look nervous.

323
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,468
Yeah. The truth is, FatJack,

324
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,202
I don't know how to swim.

325
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,267
- You can't swim?
- No, sir.

326
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,405
Then you wouldn't want me to do this.

327
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,279
Stop! Ah, don't!

328
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,809
Please, cut it out!
There's water coming in the boat!

329
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,118
I'm just having a little fun.

330
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,819
Well, don't.

331
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,727
What is that? What's the matter?

332
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:35,289
When I rocked the boat,
I must have got water in the engine.

333
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,165
I can fix it. I'm mechanical.

334
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,744
Did you fix it?

335
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,872
No. I'll go back for the other boat.

336
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,882
What?

337
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,653
Where are you going, Mr. FatJack?

338
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,691
Back to the dock. It's only a few miles.

339
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,023
I can swim it.
I'll be back with the little boat.

340
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,462
The little boat?

341
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:22,571
I knew it. I knew that guy was spying on me.

342
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,048
I want to go down!

343
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,847
Mr. Cornbeef?

344
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,219
Kornbluth!

345
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,623
Whatcha looking for down there?

346
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,923
Buried treasure?

347
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,020
Want to know what I'm looking for?

348
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:41,031
I'll tell ya.

349
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:45,060
None of your goddamn business, that's what!

350
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,332
Get out of my way!

351
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,636
Let's pee down his air hose.

352
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,909
You get that.

353
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,167
Piece of shit.

354
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,841
Ahh!

355
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:47,427
Ah, gee.

356
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,595
Ohhh!

357
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,594
Ohh.

358
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,811
Ouch!

359
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,404
Ouch.

360
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,335
Hello.

361
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:02,305
You have any idea how I got here?

362
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,137
Did you save me?

363
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:11,607
Ah,

364
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,981
do you speak English?

365
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,551
Hey! Come back!

366
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,924
Hey, come back! Please?

367
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,429
Just tell me who you are.

368
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:03,161
I've gotta talk to you.
Can I call you? What's your number?

369
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,795
I don't know how to swim.

370
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:09,204
I don't know how to swim! Come back.

371
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,936
Why didn't I learn how to swim?

372
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,376
Please, just...

373
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,970
It's a mermaid. It's her!

374
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,478
Wait a minute.

375
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:24,572
Wait a minute! Don't go.

376
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,643
Come back.

377
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:30,085
I gotta take your picture.

378
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,681
Hold it.

379
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,928
Hi, Mrs. Stimler.

380
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:21,056
Hi. What happened to your head?

381
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:24,829
- Lightning?
- No, a boat hit me.

382
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,105
- Mrs. Stimler?
- Yes?

383
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:32,871
- Nothing.
- So nice to have you back.

384
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:37,243
<i>Welcome to the Statue of Liberty.</i>

385
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,681
<i>The statue is a gift from French citizens...</i>

386
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:43,585
<i>and symbolizes hope for oppressed people.</i>

387
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:47,352
<i>Over the past century,
she has seen the skyline,</i>

388
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:51,919
<i>which once she dwarfed,
rise in mountains of stone and steel.</i>

389
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:55,955
<i>If you'll go inside, the tour will continue.</i>

390
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,332
<i>Come on. Here we go.</i>

391
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,928
<i>Let's go. We're backing up.</i>

392
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,633
<i>You've got feet, use them!</i>

393
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:08,611
<i>Don't touch my hat.
Do not ever touch my hat. That's it.</i>

394
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,615
<i>Up-up-up-up-up-up. Okay.</i>

395
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,810
<i>Welcome to the Statue of Liberty.</i>

396
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,945
<i>The statue is a gift from French citizens.</i>

397
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:20,354
<i>It has come to symbolize hope
for naked women everywhere.</i>

398
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,359
Bocci balls!

399
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,759
Hey, hey.

400
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:27,127
Come on. Don't be doing that.

401
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:30,429
Take a picture of me, Vinnie.

402
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,834
Vinnie, take my picture.

403
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:36,499
You get it? You get it!

404
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:40,704
The statue was a gift from French people.

405
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,043
Get out of the way. What's going on?

406
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:48,643
Okay, miss. This ain't California.
We don't go for this.

407
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:09,331
- What's your name?
- She don't speak no English.

408
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:12,501
- And you do?
- Here. She was carrying this.

409
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,511
What's this?

410
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,978
Who's this guy?

411
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,420
Is that enough? Do you want some more?

412
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,389
That's all we can handle. Let's talk terms.

413
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,721
- He doesn't have a clue.
- Don't worry.

414
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,727
We'll move it out in the morning.

415
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,263
Bauer. Your brother told me about...

416
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,265
your unfortunate experience in Vietnam.

417
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,664
Huh?

418
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,796
The incident in Vietnam. Remember?

419
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:47,234
The grenade still bother you?
You're wearing a bandage.

420
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,576
Page him. Hey, Al?

421
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,581
- Yeah?
- Phone.

422
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,617
Um, excuse me.

423
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,785
Thanks, Jerry. Yeah?

424
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,450
Allen Bauer. Speaking.

425
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:08,465
Yeah. On my way!

426
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,467
I believe this...

427
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,430
Allen, where are you going?

428
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,029
Allen!

429
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,876
- What happened?
- Telephone.

430
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:24,073
He was on the phone in Nam
when the grenade went off.

431
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:27,140
Ever since then, he runs,

432
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,413
gets in a car, and drives away.

433
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,081
- Oh.
- I don't know why.

434
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,147
- It just happens.
- Oh.

435
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,159
Let's review this.

436
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,683
Pardon me. Excuse me!

437
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,481
Mr. Police Officer?

438
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:05,021
Hey! Take it easy.

439
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,057
What do you want?

440
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,559
My name's Allen Bauer. You guys called me.

441
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:12,892
Any of you guys call for an Allen Bauer?

442
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:16,661
Bauer. Yeah. That's for her.

443
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,668
Right over there.

444
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,559
Hi.

445
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,528
I take it you know this girl?

446
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,672
Yeah, I do.

447
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,674
Who is she?

448
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,645
I don't know.

449
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,011
Of course.

450
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,458
Afternoon. You're home early.

451
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,623
Yeah.

452
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,539
Uh,

453
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:31,905
that doorway spins.

454
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,809
Want to get this fixed, Timmy?

455
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,176

Room service.
I didn't know what you liked,

462
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:53,954
so I got you a choice.
Fruity Pebbles, pancakes...

463
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,186
No. No.
No-no-no- no-no-no-no.

464
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,991
I've got to get back to work.
That will keep you company.

465
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:04,228
When I come back from work,
we'll get some dinner,

466
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,702
and pick you up some clothes.

467
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,501
Not that you don't look
spectacular in my robe.

468

Okay? Bye-bye.

No. Please.

470
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,877
You're gonna put me in the hospital.

471
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,852
It's about 3:00. I really have to get back.

Let's not be so choosy with these onions.

476
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:47,835
Some of these are perfectly good onions.

00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:11,261
- Freddie, dance with me!
- Please, not in front of the teamsters.

484
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,395
- Come on, they're happy guys.
- You're a rotten lead.

485
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,736
I've got the Buyrite contracts ready.

486
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,832
- Want to check them?
- No.

487
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,844
You check them. You know the business.

488
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,846
- So I'm in charge?
- Sure.

489
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,779
What about the lawyer's meeting at 8:00?

490
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,250
8 p. m.? That's too late for me.

491
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:31,755
I'm going upstairs and take a nap.

492
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:34,120
Wake me when it's time to go home.

493
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,628
Zip-a-dee...
Jerry, handle those for me!

494
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,025
Anne Klein.

495
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,727
Bloomingdale's.

496
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:50,173
Anne Klein.

497
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,471
Bloomingdale's.

498
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:59,307
The Anne Klein Collection, available at...

499
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,817
Bloomingdale's.

500
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,330
Can I help you?

501
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,396
Can't you talk?

502
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:24,099
- Bloomingdale's?
- Sure. Hey!

503
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,023
Oh, my God.

504
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,968
Darling. Darling.

505
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:31,031
Darling! That outfit, it's to die from.

506
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,906
What happened?
You saw Annie Hall 100 times?

507
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,606
That look is over.

508
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,672
You want to try that on?

509
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,149
Who knows? Maybe it's you.

510
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,379
I couldn't get one leg in there.

511
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:47,823
My daughter is lucky. She's anorexic.

512
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:53,824
Please call again. Don't forget these.

513
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,769
Do yourself a favor and stop
in the lingerie department.

514
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:02,863
A pretty girl like you
shouldn't wear boxer shorts.

515
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,838
Let me try!

Zip-a-dee-doo-dah
Hello?

533
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:10,705
I'm home!

534
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,885
- I'm looking for a girl, Timmy.
- 200 bucks.

535
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,520
No, the blonde I came in with.

536
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,394
- Oh, she left.
- Any idea where?

537
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:38,367
- I put her in a cab.
- To where, Timmy?

538
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,269
- Bloomingdale's.
- Bloomingdale's. Great. Thanks.

539
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:44,671
Yo! Hey, taxi! Hey!

540
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,676
Halt, taxi, please!

541
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,110
She works hard
for the money

542
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,547
Come on, come on. Let's go!

543
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:56,518
She works hard for the money
so you better treat her right

544
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:59,954
Excuse me, miss,
we're getting ready to close.

545
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,959
She's been here for six hours.

546
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,962
Excuse me, miss.

547
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:09,556
I'm going to insist that...

548
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:13,194
that you stop doing that.

549
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:19,005
She's exercising.

550
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,645
Give her... a minute.

551
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:25,773
Sir, we're closing.

552
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,375
I know.
Just give me three minutes.

553
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,750
- Come back.
- Three minutes. You can time me!

554
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:35,987
Oh, thank God.

555
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,187
Excuse me. Do you know this woman?

556
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,026
Yeah. Just don't ask me her name.

557
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:43,464
We've been trying to tell her
it's closing time,

558
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,832
but she doesn't seem to understand.

559
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,770
That's because she doesn't speak English.

560
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,775
Hello, Allen. How was your day?

561
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,902
I never went to college,

562
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,278
but wasn't that English?

563
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,283
Thank you for letting me use your television.

564
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,411
It was very educational.

565
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,789
It's all right, miss.

566
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,628
What's your name?

567
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:14,493
It's hard to say in English.

568
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,625
Well, just say it in your language.

569
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,169
All right. My name is...

570
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,815
Hey, how 'bout those Knicks?

571
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:42,018
I'm confused why you haven't
said anything until now.

572
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:45,357
- I didn't know English.
- I see. Now you do?

573
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:48,057
I learned from television. It's wonderful!

574
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,828
I'll ask questions
and if you answer correctly,

575
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,301
you can win one of these prizes.

576
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,066
A wall clock, matching washer and dryer,

577
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,199
or a brand-new car!

578
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:00,300
Let me go first, okay?

579
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:02,311
Who are you? Where are you from?

580
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:04,313
Begin when you were born...

581
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:06,781
and finish when you blew up the TV's.

582
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,651
Pretty.

583
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:20,959
Well, yeah. I've never
thought about it before.

584
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,957
Are you from Cape Cod?

585
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:29,166
No, I'm from another place.

586
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:33,903
Yeah? I've got a cousin from there.
Ha-ha- ha.

587
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,414
Are you an American?

588
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,473
No.

589
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:44,351
Then why were you in
Cape Cod and now New York?

590
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:48,357
- How did the cops find you naked?
- What's that?

591
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,450
What? The music?

592
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:53,155
I like music! I heard some in the television,

593
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,391
Dance Fever.

594
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:59,197
Hey, I love you, girl

595
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:02,670
- Darling
- Ah, hi, hi.

596
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:05,300
We better go, hon, or else we'll be late.

597
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:08,504
- You never heard music?
- What's that?

598
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:11,275
Ah...

599
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,282
Oh, gosh!

600
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,284
- What's that?
- It's a movie theater.

601
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:17,684
What the hell you doin'?
You coulda got me killed!

602
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:20,189
Cut her some slack.
She's from out of town.

603
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:23,385
- Keep her on a leash.
- Yeah, yeah. Have a nice day.

604
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,394
Hello?

605
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,333
Did you see this?

606
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:34,565
It's wonderfully delicious
and so good for you.

607
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:38,130
While you're here, watch a little less TV.

608
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:43,741
How long are you going to be in town?

609
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,477
Six fun-filled days.

610
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,519
Oh, six days.

611
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:51,520
Is that all?

612
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,387
Six days,

613
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:58,053
and the moon is full.

614
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,494
Oh.

615
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:04,532
The moon is full.

616
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,738
If I stay longer than that,
I can't ever go back.

617
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,745
Oh, I get... What?

618
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:19,078
Is there some sort of immigration problem?

619
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:21,083
Where did you get that?

620
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,676
Where? Oh, for...

621
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:29,585
Sir? Here you are, sir. There you go.

622
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,187
I'm going to have to call
you something in English,

623
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:36,198
because I can't pronounce... What?

624
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:38,291
What are English names?

625
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,666
There's millions of them, I guess.

626
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,763
Jennifer, Joanie, Hillary.

627
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,138
Careful. Those are hot.

628
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,643
Names, names. Linda, Kim...

629
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:49,736
Where are we? Madison.

630
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:52,543
- Elizabeth, Samantha...
- I like Madison.

631
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:55,016
Madison's not a name.

632
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,614
Well, all right. Madison it is.

633
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,488
Good thing we weren't
at 149th Street.

634
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,323
Are we going back to where you live?

635
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:08,330
Okay, um... Here's the thing.

636
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:11,094
I was going to find you a hotel,

637
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:15,468
but I figure that after this afternoon...

638
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:19,270
Well, I just assumed that...

639
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:24,638
Would you mind staying with me?

640
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:28,181
I want to stay with you.

641
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:31,187
You're the reason I came here.

642
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,293
Ah, that was a kiss.

643
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:45,301
I know.

644
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,734
Madison?

645
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:10,308
- Madison?
- Allen?

646
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,110
Yeah, of course, it's Allen.

647
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,117
What are you doing, sweetheart?

648
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:17,517
Taking a bath.

649
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:20,784
Ooo, ooo. Can I come in?

650
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,488
No!

651
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:26,722
What was that?

652
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,731
Madison, are you all right?

653
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,791
- Everything's fine.
- Then let me in.

654
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:34,666
I'll be right there. I'm just changing.

655
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:37,571
Enough! Open the door.
Something is wrong.

656
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,939
Allen, can you make me some pancakes?

657
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,035
Make you some... Madison!

658
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,672
All right, Madison, this is getting scary.

659
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,841
Either open this door,
or I'll break it down!

660
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:49,750
- No, Allen, please.
- All right, that's it!

661
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,017
- Allen, no!
- Ow.

662
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,567
Hi.

663
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:09,332
Hi. Are you okay?

664
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,340
Yeah.

665
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:14,536
Why wouldn't you let me in?

666
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:18,547
I was... shy.

667
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,517
You were shy?

668
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:24,577
After the car, elevator, bedroom,

669
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:28,522
and top of the refrigerator,
you were shy?

670
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,585
I was shy.

671
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:34,596
She was shy.

672
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,156
Hey, B.B. Brain!

673
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:11,428
- Yeah?
- See this hose?

674
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:14,959
- It's so I can breathe.
- Uh-huh.

675
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:17,802
You want to get your chair off it?

676
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:20,274
Huh?

677
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,913
The Star Confidential?

678
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,355
Yeah.

679
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,586
- Why are you reading that?
- I don't know.

680
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:41,154
What possesses the uneducated
to purchase these?

681
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:45,065
- Interesting.
- You're not helping yourself.

682
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:48,263
You're not... This is not news.

683
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:51,273
Give me this. You know what's in here?

684
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:54,777
Nothing. You have sex, perversion.

685
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:57,609
It's all fabrication. Look at this.

686
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:00,707
A naked woman at the Statue of Liberty.

687
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:05,378
Where would they find a girl to do that?

688
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,390
- Ow, my head!
- Let me see that.

689
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,232
Take me back to shore. Now!

690
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,872
Hello.

691
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:36,245
Madison, what is it?

692
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,344
What happened?

693
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,186
It's the saddest thing I ever saw.

694
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:47,822
It's Bonanza.

695
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:51,197
The man killed another man
and he died in the street.

696
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:55,932
No, no. This is only TV.

697
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:59,567
I thought you understood
about TV being make-believe.

698
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:03,010
It's pretend killing that's going on.

699
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:05,206
This guy is an actor.

700
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:07,512
Next week, he'll get shot
on another show.

701
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:09,518
It's kinda funny.

702
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:14,256
I'm supposed to laugh?

703
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:16,519
Yeah.

704
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:18,584
There you go.

705
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:21,062
Yeah.

706
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,292
I got you something.

707
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:41,575
It's beautiful. I love it.

708
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,154
No, you open it.

709
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,214
There's more?

710
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,868
Do you like that?

711
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:09,268
Yeah, I do.

712
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,173
I don't know why. Just...

713
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:15,177
something about it.

714
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:18,373
It's always appealed to me.

715
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:21,509
Do you like the sea?

716
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:24,553
No. When I was about eight,

717
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:27,055
I had this accident on a ship.

718
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:29,250
I remember.

719
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,226
What?

720
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:33,660
Ah, I can't.

721
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,664
I forget the words.

722
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:38,860
What's... "I understand. "

723
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,866
Did you get hurt?

724
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:48,404
No, no, I didn't,

725
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:53,381
but when I was underwater,
I could have sworn I saw...

726
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:57,511
- What?
- Nothing.

727
00:55:57,587 --> 00:55:59,521
- What?
- Nothing!

728
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:02,422
I was just a stupid kid.

729
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:09,253
- They're going to tear this park out.
- Why?

730
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:13,098
They're gonna build condos
or some such nonsense.

731
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:15,501
What are you gonna do, huh?

732
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:21,872
You want to go home?

733
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:23,913
No, I have five days left!

734
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,814
No-no-no. My home!

735
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:31,376
Oh. Yes.

736
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:44,259
Why do we want
to go to a political dinner?

737
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:47,497
- The president will be speaking.
- President of what?

738
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,971
President of the
Three Stooges Fan Club.

739
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,474
- The president of the United States!
- Wow.

740
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:54,533
We'll be rubbing elbows
with the big boys.

741
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:57,375
- You think big, you be big.
- I guess so.

742
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:59,381
Listen,

743
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:02,646
would you mind if I took Madison...

744
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,313
instead of going with you?

745
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:09,355
What?

746
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,860
- What?
- What?

747
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,488
Something in here not working?

748
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:18,227
"Oh, I'll never fall in love, Freddie.

749
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:21,099
I can't. It won't work with me. "

750
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:23,969
Who said anything
about me being in love?

751
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,406
You haven't been to work in two days.

752
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,410
- So?
- Admit it.

753
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:30,070
- No.
- Admit it!

754
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:31,909
Eye gouge!

755
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:36,450
Ahhh. Ahhh!

756
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:39,955
- Admit it. Bone crusher!
- No.

757
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:46,822
Son of a bi...

758
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,306
Ow.

759
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,101
How long we been playing?

760
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:05,272
- About five minutes.
- Oh, God.

761
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:08,511
My heart's beating like a rabbit.

762
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:10,519
You, uh, want a beer?

763
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,782
No, thanks.

764
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,370
So, tell me this.

765
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:31,839
If you're not in love with her,

766
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:35,002
how come little things she does,
drive you crazy?

767
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:37,012
Little things?

768
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:41,278
Freddie, the woman learned English
in a single afternoon.

769
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:45,914
She could probably speak English already.

770
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:48,048
I think she was in shock from being arrested.

771
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:50,354
What about that, huh?

772
00:58:50,427 --> 00:58:53,123
What about a woman showing up
naked in a public place?

773
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,857
I'm for it.

774
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,831
You said...

775
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,529
that she had some kind
of immigration problem.

776
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:04,505
She's on an ocean liner
in international waters.

777
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:08,510
She sees America. It looks good.

778
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:12,173
So, she greases her body
like a channel swimmer.

779
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:16,582
She dives in.
She has heavy trouble with sharks,

780
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:20,851
she goes through the Coast Guard,
minefields and then she's on shore.

781
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:22,858
She's okay. That's it.

782
00:59:24,995 --> 00:59:27,088
What about the bathtub?

783
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:30,189
This moon stuff, and all those TV's?

784
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:32,530
Look, I'm being serious.

785
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:37,437
I admit to a few minor fiascos
in my love life.

786
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:42,240
Freddie, you took a date
to one of your own weddings!

787
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:44,644
I'm a free spirit!

788
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:48,013
I'm extremely liberal,
a freewheeling dude.

789
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:52,953
You're in love with this girl. You're
trying to convince yourself you're not.

790
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,786
I just don't know, Freddie.

791
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,055
Something about it isn't right.

792
00:59:59,129 --> 01:00:01,063
I'll serve.

793
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:03,565
Hold the beer. That will be your handicap.

794
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:06,227
- Oh, we're gonna play?
- Yeah.

795
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:09,567
- I'm gonna teach you a lesson in humility.
- Wait.

796
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,664
Humility 101.

797
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:13,675
- You all set?
- Yeah.

798
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,938
Here we go.

799
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:17,639
Oh!

800
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,914
This is what we came to hear?

801
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:35,589
You call and tell us you have
stretched the frontiers of paleontology...

802
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,758
and zoology.

803
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:41,167
We interrupt important, serious work...

804
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:43,398
to fly here at a moment's notice,

805
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:46,067
and you give us mermaids!

806
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,975
Don't call us.
Call the comic book companies.

807
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:52,981
Enough. We have a seminar
in three weeks. Be ready.

808
01:00:58,288 --> 01:01:01,086
Allen, you're here! I got you a present.

809
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:04,752
- Don't look. Close your eyes.
- I gotta close the door.

810
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:07,023
What are you doing?

811
01:01:07,097 --> 01:01:09,463
All right.

812
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:13,434
Okay. Look.

813
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:23,038
Ha-ha! Wha... You, ah...

814
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:26,105
Well, that's big!

815
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:30,143
Yeah, this is...

816
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,814
This is very... big,

817
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:35,289
and it's... really here.

818
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,349
It's just so big!

819
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:39,987
They were gonna tear it down,
so I bought it for you.

820
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:42,896
Where did you get
the money to pay for it?

821
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:47,965
Madison, where's your necklace?

822
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:51,666
- I traded it for the statue.
- Why?

823
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:55,506
Because I love you.

824
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,478
Oh, Madison.

825
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:05,913
Madison, I love...

826
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:08,219
this, ah, present.

827
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,486
I love it.

828
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:15,490
And I love you.

829
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,838
What's happened to you?

830
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:26,137
You were the brightest student in my class.

831
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:29,508
True, emotionally, you were 12 years old.

832
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:33,174
- I was 12 years old.
- That's right.

833
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:35,444
Look what you've become;

834
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:37,748
a schmuck.

835
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:41,620
There is a mermaid in New York City.

836
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,627
You mean this, this naked girl?

837
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:47,720
How come she's got legs?

838
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:52,029
She has legs out of water
and fins in the water.

839
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:55,798
You taught me that,
Dr. Zidell. Remember?

840
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:58,773
You taught me all the legends.

841
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:01,935
You used to show me charts
on your office walls...

842
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:05,742
where sailors had claimed they saw mermaids.

843
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:08,750
Walter, that was for fun, for relaxation,

844
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:12,083
not for you to build your whole life on.

845
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:17,054
I'm gonna prove to you
and everyone else that...

846
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:20,186
that girl is a mermaid!

847
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:22,629
How? You gonna get her wet...

848
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:24,929
so everybody sees she has fins?

849
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,937
Taxi?

850
01:04:05,108 --> 01:04:06,302
Oh!

851
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:08,708
- Watch it!
- Hey, watch it, buddy.

852
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:11,440
Excuse me.

853
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,814
Look out.

854
01:04:19,756 --> 01:04:21,815
What does he think he's doing?

855
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:25,316
Hey! Hey!

856
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,803
Oh, my...

857
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:44,380
Ow, ohh, ooof!

858
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:12,201
Oops.

859
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:15,368
Nice earrings.

860
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:21,279
- Is something the matter?
- No, nothing at all.

861
01:05:21,351 --> 01:05:25,788
I was thinking.
You don't have to leave the country.

862
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:30,858
- I do.
- You don't. There's stuff we can do...

863
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,896
to get around the immigration laws.

864
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:37,831
I could give you a job down at the market.

865
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,562
You could get a work visa.

866
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:44,333
Or, uh, you could, uh,

867
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:47,808
marry, like, an American,

868
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:50,072
and they have to let you stay.

869
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:52,114
Our food is here!

870
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:58,053
Oh. Well, we'll talk about it later.

871
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:02,888
Do be careful, madam.
The plate is very hot.

872
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,893
Thank you. These look terrific.

873
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:29,117
She's really hungry!

874
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,944
You were very good.

875
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:59,004
Come on. Oops. Come on.

876
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:04,351
Let's sit down and talk.

877
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,388
Ah.

878
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:10,220
Your nose is cold.

879
01:07:10,293 --> 01:07:12,227
I don't want to talk about my nose.

880
01:07:12,295 --> 01:07:14,695
Your ears are all red!

881
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:18,632
I don't want to talk
about any part of my face.

882
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:23,968
But I do want to talk about
what happened in the restaurant.

883
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:27,008
I'm sorry.

884
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:29,567
That's how we eat lobster
where I come from.

885
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:34,981
Oh, no-no-no.
I don't care about that.

886
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:39,746
I was trying to do something in there,
and I guess I did it very badly.

887
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:41,949
I was trying...

888
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:48,590
to ask you if you wanted to get married.

889
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:52,599
Madison, will you marry me?

890
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:00,608
No.

891
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:03,736
What? No? Just no?

892
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:06,782
You don't want to think
about it, kick it around?

893
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:09,044
- I can't.
- Why?

894
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:11,712
I can't tell you.

895
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:14,051
I know you have some big secret you think...

896
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:16,182
you can't tell me, but you can.

897
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:18,284
- You're already married?
- Allen.

898
01:08:18,361 --> 01:08:20,522
You're dying? You were once a man?

899
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:23,121
- Whatever it is, you can tell me.
- Allen.

900
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,600
I only have three days left.

901
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:30,798
Please make them wonderful.

902
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:35,076
Okay.

903
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:44,876
Want to skate some more?

904
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:48,015
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

905
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,728
Allen?

906
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,913
You know them?

907
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:15,781
No, I've just seen them before.

908
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:18,615
I guess they've come here
for about 40 years.

909
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,258
They look very happy.

910
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:26,625
Why shouldn't they be happy, huh?

911
01:09:26,696 --> 01:09:29,961
They get to spend
their whole lives together.

912
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:36,903
Is this really what happens
when water gets cold?

913
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:39,100
Yeah.

914
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,201
Where I come from, it never gets cold.

915
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:44,712
Well, hey, what a breakthrough!

916
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:48,011
You just really opened up to me there.

917
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:53,113
Your voice sounds funny.

918
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,384
It's called sarcasm.

919
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:58,222
They don't have that where
you come from either?

920
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,955
No.

921
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:06,627
Well, they don't have anything, do they?

922
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:11,036
They don't have ice, or music or clothes.

923
01:10:11,107 --> 01:10:13,905
What kind of a place is this?

924
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,372
Madison?

925
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:20,438
- Madison!
- Hey, those skates are rented!

926
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:24,316
Give me one second. Madison?
Ahh! Madison!

927
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:29,583
Madison, please? I'm sorry!

928
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:32,685
Let her go. Show some dignity.

929
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:34,252
Madison?

930
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:44,439
Thanks.

931
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:38,181
Hey, Charlie. How's it goin'?

932
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:44,792
- Allen?
- What?

933
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:55,393
Yes.

934
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:14,353
If we get our blood test today,
we can marry tomorrow!

935
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:16,357
Before the blood test,
I have to tell you everything.

936
01:13:16,425 --> 01:13:18,893
So, tell me.

937
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:21,828
- Not today.
- But see,

938
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:24,525
if we get the test today...
no pressure, mind you...

939
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,331
then as soon as you tell me,
we can get married.

940
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,895
Listen, you will love being married to me.

941
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:35,433
I was born to be married.
Mom and Dad were married.

942
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:38,878
Their moms and dads were married too.

943
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:19,713
Son of a bitch.

944
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:22,222
I thought we were going upstairs.

945
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:25,124
I love you. I'm not gonna lose you again.

946
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:27,628
We are getting married tonight.

947
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:31,291
We're gonna drive to Maryland.
Freddie always marries there.

948
01:14:31,367 --> 01:14:33,699
You don't need
a blood test down there.

949
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:37,034
There's this dinner
with the president. Damn!

950
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:40,837
Hey, that's okay!
We'll go to Maryland after dinner.

951
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:43,470
- We'll already be dressed up!
- I haven't told you...

952
01:14:43,545 --> 01:14:45,979
You haven't told me this big secret.

953
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:47,982
Tell me on the way to Maryland.

954
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:50,985
Oooh!

955
01:15:21,417 --> 01:15:24,750
I hope we have a boy and a girl.

956
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:30,550
- What kind?
- Wha... What kind?

957
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:33,026
The young kind, I guess.

958
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:35,689
The older ones are
a little hard to deliver.

959
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:37,698
We're getting married tonight.

960
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:39,700
- Wonderful.
- Thank you.

961
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:43,431
Why is this bread in here
instead of out there?

962
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:46,099
The butter is hard like a rock.

963
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:48,700
Do you have a broken arm?

964
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:51,871
No, it's fractured in 16 places.

965
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:53,915
Why are you here?

966
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:57,218
The union sent me.

967
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:02,752
My God, the president is here!

968
01:16:02,825 --> 01:16:06,226
The president's here. The president's here!

969
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,513
Hmm.

970
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:43,892
I'm just a corn-fed Kansas boy,

971
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:47,094
but you are the Big Apple of my eye.

972
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:50,763
Thank you.

973
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:52,773
<i>Thank you.</i>

974
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:54,900
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

975
01:16:56,445 --> 01:17:00,814
<i>Thank you.
It's great to be back in New York.</i>

976
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,385
Alert. Alert. Table 5.

977
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,453
Intercept busboy with suspicious hump.

978
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,832
He's reaching! Get him now!

979
01:17:20,903 --> 01:17:23,997
- Sir, I'd like a word with you, please.
- About what?

980
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:26,007
This has nothing to do with the president.

981
01:17:26,075 --> 01:17:28,908
This has nothing to do with the president!

982
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:35,575
Well, I guess he just found out
what his dinner cost.

983
01:17:38,554 --> 01:17:43,017
I want to talk to the press.

984
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:45,424
I have a formal statement to make!

985
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:49,123
In Bob Hollins,
you have a candidate for Congress...

986
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:51,257
who is in touch with the people,

987
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:55,133
a man who built up the business
left to him by his grandfather.

988
01:17:55,204 --> 01:17:57,138
What was once a small
pushcart on wheels...

989
01:17:57,206 --> 01:18:00,175
- Allen?
- Yeah?

990
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:02,608
It's time for me to tell you.

991
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,771
What? Now?

992
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:08,180
- Right now.
- Okay. Great.

993
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,218
- Not here.
- Fine. Fine.

994
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:12,219
But more importantly, with fresh meat.

995
01:18:14,723 --> 01:18:17,817
- I am not crazy. There's a mermaid in there.
- Shut up.

996
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:19,827
<i>- What mermaid?
- I am a scientist!</i>

997
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:22,363
Where's the goddamn car!

998
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:25,194
The gray BMW.

999
01:18:29,905 --> 01:18:32,032
Hey, I know that guy.

1000
01:18:32,107 --> 01:18:35,042
I saw him on Cape Cod. He was crazy then.

1001
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:38,671
There she is! There she is!

1002
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,645
- Don't let him shoot that.
- That a gun?

1003
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:46,347
- Hold it!
- No!

1004
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:49,549
Get that thing out ofhis hand.

1005
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:51,525
Grab that hose!

1006
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:54,756
Grab him! Get him!

1007
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:01,393
- No!
- What's going on?

1008
01:19:20,556 --> 01:19:22,922
I was right!

1009
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:26,893
Behold the mermaid!

1010
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:35,094
<i>Let me outta here!</i>

1011
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:37,104
Who are you? What is your name?

1012
01:19:37,172 --> 01:19:38,867
Allen!

1013
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:42,442
- What do we do?
- Grab her. Grab everybody.

1014
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:46,709
- I want to see her.
- Allen! Allen!

1015
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:49,817
Get her! Get her!

1016
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:53,477
Allen!

1017
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:58,588
Please?

1018
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:01,629
- Let's pick her up.
- Allen. Allen!

1019
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:09,128
Allen. Allen.

1020
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:16,034
Allen!

1021
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:25,745
Good afternoon, Dr. Ross.

1022
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,790
<i>Dr. Hill, line 5. Stat!</i>

1023
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,593
- Buckwalter.
- Sir!

1024
01:20:33,729 --> 01:20:35,663
Gentlemen.

1025
01:20:35,731 --> 01:20:37,665
- Anything?
- No change.

1026
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:51,078
I am not a fish!

1027
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:55,674
How many times do
I have to tell you that?

1028
01:20:55,751 --> 01:20:58,811
Will you just let me out of here?

1029
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:02,118
Please? Huh? People?

1030
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,283
Let's try some interaction.

1031
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,725
Fine. Jim?

1032
01:21:58,714 --> 01:22:02,741
I guess they thought you might be one.

1033
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:06,452
Yeah.

1034
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:08,580
I guess so.

1035
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:13,693
You said whatever my secret was,
you'd understand.

1036
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:17,061
I know.

1037
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:23,601
You thought at least I was a human being.

1038
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:32,079
Allen?

1039
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:51,930
He's been in the water 12 hours.
He's just a man.

1040
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,265
Get him out so we
can concentrate on her.

1041
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:09,382
Greg Martin, W-M-E-T Radio,
here with Allen Bauer.

1042
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:12,909
- When did you meet the mermaid?
- Tell me where.

1043
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,183
Did you know she was a mermaid?

1044
01:23:15,257 --> 01:23:18,920
- Did you actually make love to her?
- That's a stupid question.

1045
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,928
Did she eat worms?

1046
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,658
Would you have to make
love to her in water?

1047
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:25,632
That's none of your business.

1048
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:28,134
Is she a mutant or missing link?

1049
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:30,137
No, she's not.

1050
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:33,038
I'm from People.
Is she also seeing Burt Reynolds?

1051
01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:36,202
For crying out loud!

1052
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:41,342
Leave him alone!

1053
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:45,182
Leave him alone! Get out of the way!

1054
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:47,244
- Let me through.
- Out of the way.

1055
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:50,416
- Allen, you all right?
- Yeah. Get me out.

1056
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:52,960
Is anyone here from Penthouse?

1057
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:56,327
- No.
- Then we ain't talking.

1058
01:24:17,018 --> 01:24:19,248
Hey, Allen?

1059
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,594
What are you looking at? You never
saw a guy who slept with a fish?

1060
01:24:29,664 --> 01:24:32,258
Get back to work!

1061
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:36,437
Mr. Bauer, you had a million messages.

1062
01:24:36,505 --> 01:24:38,564
I wrote them down.

1063
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:43,907
You got calls from CBS, NBC, ABC, AP,

1064
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:48,006
UPI, Ted Turner, Time, Newsweek,

1065
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,779
Marineland, "Ripley's Believe It Or Not,"

1066
01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:53,286
and Mrs. Paul.

1067
01:24:53,355 --> 01:24:56,085
Not now, Mrs. Stimler.

1068
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:03,261
"Fishman?"

1069
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:05,265
Fishman!

1070
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:08,200
That's what they're
calling you on TV too.

1071
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:10,761
Personally, I think it's kinda cute.

1072
01:25:14,643 --> 01:25:17,669
- So, how is she?
- How is she?

1073
01:25:17,746 --> 01:25:22,206
She's... a mermaid.

1074
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:26,345
I don't understand. All my life...

1075
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:28,548
I've been waiting for someone...

1076
01:25:28,623 --> 01:25:30,955
and when I find her,

1077
01:25:31,026 --> 01:25:32,960
she's a fish.

1078
01:25:33,028 --> 01:25:35,326
Nobody said love's perfect!

1079
01:25:35,397 --> 01:25:40,198
Oh, Freddie, I don't expect it
to be perfect,

1080
01:25:40,268 --> 01:25:43,135
but for God's sake, it's usually human!

1081
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:47,603
Every day people meet and they fall in love.

1082
01:25:47,676 --> 01:25:49,610
Look what I got.

1083
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:55,409
Look what you got. Yeah, let's look.

1084
01:25:56,518 --> 01:25:59,487
Let's take a good look at what you got.

1085
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:02,114
- People fall in love every day, huh?
- Yeah.

1086
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:06,092
That's a crock! It doesn't work that way.

1087
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08,789
Do you realize how happy
you were with her?

1088
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:11,331
That is, when you weren't
driving yourself crazy.

1089
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:14,459
Every day? Come on.

1090
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:18,199
Some people will never be that happy!
I'll never be that happy.

1091
01:26:22,877 --> 01:26:24,811
What am I talking to you for?

1092
01:26:24,879 --> 01:26:27,848
You don't know nothing. Mrs. Stimler?

1093
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:03,083
Does she look a little pale?

1094
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,315
Ah, that's a good day's work.

1095
01:27:07,389 --> 01:27:10,756
Tomorrow, I want to see
how she interacts...

1096
01:27:10,825 --> 01:27:14,192
with other marine life,
then the internal examination.

1097
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:18,565
Internal?

1098
01:27:18,633 --> 01:27:21,659
I want to study her pulmonary system,

1099
01:27:21,736 --> 01:27:25,263
- reproductive organs, everything!
- Dr. Ross?

1100
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:28,901
Are we considering...

1101
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:32,674
how the subject is responding
to the examination procedure?

1102
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:34,681
I'm considering everything!

1103
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:37,115
Ah, yes,

1104
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:39,779
I'm sure you are, Dr. Ross.

1105
01:27:39,854 --> 01:27:42,448
How stupid of me. But let me ask,

1106
01:27:42,524 --> 01:27:44,754
are you considering the possibility...

1107
01:27:44,826 --> 01:27:47,192
that you might be a sadistic pig?

1108
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,436
While we are baring
our souls, Mr. Kornbluth,

1109
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:59,064
I must honestly tell you I have never
considered you a man of science.

1110
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:02,234
You're not a member of my team.

1111
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:07,338
Run along, Walter.
See if you can't find a unicorn.

1112
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:19,576
- What's that?
- Painkiller, Mr. Kornbluth.

1113
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:22,555
Whoever punched you
cracked your tooth.

1114
01:29:22,624 --> 01:29:25,184
We'll be very close to the nerve.

1115
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:29,094
I don't deserve painkiller. Just drill.

1116
01:29:29,164 --> 01:29:32,861
Oh, you want pain.
Well, we aim to please.

1117
01:29:35,804 --> 01:29:37,669
Get out.

1118
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:39,798
- What are you...
- Get out!

1119
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:43,207
- Ja, ja, ja.
- Please stay. Ahh!

1120
01:29:44,312 --> 01:29:46,246
Let's talk.

1121
01:29:49,117 --> 01:29:51,677
Hey, put that down.

1122
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:54,244
- Put that needle down.
- Stay away from me.

1123
01:29:54,322 --> 01:29:58,053
- I said, "Let's talk. " Put it down.
- Stay away!

1124
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:05,065
Ahhh!

1125
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:09,798
Ahhh! Ohhh!

1126
01:30:11,105 --> 01:30:12,800
Uh.

1127
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:15,839
Ah!

1128
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:20,981
Ah!

1129
01:30:21,049 --> 01:30:23,108
What a week I'm having!

1130
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:28,221
You've destroyed my life, Kornbluth.

1131
01:30:28,289 --> 01:30:31,349
I didn't mean to.

1132
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:34,554
I just had to prove that I wasn't crazy.

1133
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:37,427
I'm a man of science.

1134
01:30:39,534 --> 01:30:43,732
I just didn't think about
how it would affect you...

1135
01:30:43,805 --> 01:30:45,739
or her.

1136
01:30:45,807 --> 01:30:48,241
I'm really a nice guy.

1137
01:30:48,309 --> 01:30:50,869
If I had friends, you could ask them.

1138
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:55,473
I've been on the phone to
every employee of the government...

1139
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:59,418
calling them sons of bitches.

1140
01:30:59,487 --> 01:31:02,251
Nobody could even get in to see her.

1141
01:31:04,025 --> 01:31:05,959
I can.

1142
01:31:09,063 --> 01:31:11,463
Come on. Come on!

1143
01:31:11,532 --> 01:31:13,591
- Ahh!
- Come on.

1144
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:58,875
Good afternoon, Dr. Kornbluth.
I wasn't expecting you today.

1145
01:31:58,947 --> 01:32:01,040
These are Drs. Jarred and Johanssen...

1146
01:32:01,115 --> 01:32:03,174
from the Stockholm Institute.

1147
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:05,481
I thought they were
coming later with Dr. Ross.

1148
01:32:05,553 --> 01:32:10,513
No, no. That story was to fool the press.

1149
01:32:10,591 --> 01:32:13,958
You know, I'm half Swedish.

1150
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:20,390
- Ja.
- Ja.

1151
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:27,807
- Ja.
- Oh, ja.

1152
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:31,675
- Well!
- Just a second.

1153
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:50,729
Ah.

1154
01:33:01,876 --> 01:33:04,538
- How the hell did you do that?
- Let me tell you.

1155
01:33:04,612 --> 01:33:07,206
Many nudie films come from Sweden.

1156
01:33:07,281 --> 01:33:11,183
After you see them 400 or 500 times,
the stuff sinks in.

1157
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:13,686
Afternoon, Buckwalter.

1158
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:15,848
Sorry, no one comes in...

1159
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:18,721
until Dr. Ross gets back
with them Swede people.

1160
01:33:18,793 --> 01:33:20,727
These are the Swedish doctors.

1161
01:33:20,795 --> 01:33:24,162
These are... Swedes?

1162
01:33:24,232 --> 01:33:26,393
Ah, come here.

1163
01:33:26,467 --> 01:33:30,267
Isn't that one kinda dark?

1164
01:33:30,338 --> 01:33:32,636
He's dirty from the trip!

1165
01:33:32,707 --> 01:33:35,073
- Let us in.
- I'm not supposed to.

1166
01:33:35,143 --> 01:33:37,168
What are you afraid of?

1167
01:33:37,245 --> 01:33:41,079
Do you think we're
gonna steal the mermaid?

1168
01:33:41,149 --> 01:33:43,447
Steal the mermaid.
Stealing the mermaid!

1169
01:33:43,518 --> 01:33:46,851
Are we gonna fold her in half
and put her in a briefcase?

1170
01:33:46,921 --> 01:33:48,912
In a briefcase. In half.

1171
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:51,652
I guess it's all right.

1172
01:33:51,726 --> 01:33:53,557
Go in. Go in.

1173
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:55,493
- Good joke, there.
- Yeah.

1174
01:34:30,565 --> 01:34:32,965
- Hi.
- Hi.

1175
01:34:33,034 --> 01:34:36,800
Is this the big secret you've been keeping,

1176
01:34:36,871 --> 01:34:39,601
that you're a mermaid,
or is there something else?

1177
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:41,801
No, that's it.

1178
01:34:45,046 --> 01:34:48,379
Allen, don't feel guilty.

1179
01:34:48,449 --> 01:34:50,610
Guilty? About what?

1180
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:52,983
About not loving me anymore.

1181
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:57,184
Oh, Madison.

1182
01:34:57,258 --> 01:34:59,522
All the time we were together,

1183
01:34:59,594 --> 01:35:02,062
you always knew how I was feeling.

1184
01:35:02,130 --> 01:35:04,064
Can't you tell now?

1185
01:35:13,374 --> 01:35:17,071
Well, left my wife
in New Orleans

1186
01:35:17,145 --> 01:35:19,375
Forty-eight kids
and a can of beans

1187
01:35:19,447 --> 01:35:22,348
- Left, right, one, two
- Oh, my God!

1188
01:35:22,416 --> 01:35:24,475
- What?
- Stand back, man.

1189
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:27,988
Cover his face, for God's sake!

1190
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:30,649
What happened? What's going on?

1191
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:33,285
Dr. Johanssen bent down
to examine that creature...

1192
01:35:33,361 --> 01:35:36,091
and suddenly these rays
came out of her eyes!

1193
01:35:36,164 --> 01:35:39,497
Don't go in there!
She'll melt your face off.

1194
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:41,558
I knew something would happen.
What should I do?

1195
01:35:41,636 --> 01:35:45,072
- Don't whine. Seal off the area.
- I'll call the Pentagon.

1196
01:35:45,139 --> 01:35:48,108
You want to create a national panic?

1197
01:35:48,176 --> 01:35:51,509
- I don't want to die!
- Pull yourself together.

1198
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:53,740
Don't let anybody in that room.

1199
01:35:53,814 --> 01:35:57,045
I'll be back with nuclear weapons.
Come on, Doctor.

1200
01:36:24,845 --> 01:36:27,075
Good afternoon, Dr. Ross.
Who are your guests?

1201
01:36:27,148 --> 01:36:30,447
Drs. Jarred and Johanssen
from the Swedish Institute.

1202
01:36:30,518 --> 01:36:32,679
Sir?

1203
01:36:32,753 --> 01:36:37,213
Dr. Kornbluth left with
the Swedes a few minutes ago.

1204
01:36:43,231 --> 01:36:47,133
Hiya, boys. Come in. The water's fine.

1205
01:36:50,504 --> 01:36:54,235
Let's get her back now! And arrest him.

1206
01:37:08,356 --> 01:37:13,760
We have a blue BMW. Over.

1207
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:37,850
Come on.

1208
01:37:37,918 --> 01:37:41,649
Know something?
I don't think we're being followed.

1209
01:37:41,722 --> 01:37:44,714
Wha... Well, that was easy.

1210
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:48,284
That was simple! We did it!

1211
01:37:48,362 --> 01:37:50,660
- My plan.
- You're a genius.

1212
01:37:50,731 --> 01:37:53,199
I am a genius,
but you came in with the Swedish thing.

1213
01:37:53,267 --> 01:37:56,828
That was a brilliant touch.

1214
01:37:56,904 --> 01:37:59,134
I didn't even like you when we first met.

1215
01:37:59,206 --> 01:38:01,572
Nobody likes me when they first meet me.

1216
01:38:03,644 --> 01:38:06,078
Allen?

1217
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:14,913
- Move!
- All right. Here we go!

1218
01:38:31,172 --> 01:38:33,402
<i>Suspect heading south on Broadway.</i>

1219
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:10,577
<i>Unit One. Lost them
in the Wall Street district. Over.</i>

1220
01:39:13,347 --> 01:39:15,281
- Stop the car.
- What?

1221
01:39:15,349 --> 01:39:18,113
Stop and let me out.
I'll slow them down. Do it!

1222
01:39:24,558 --> 01:39:28,050
I caused all this.
Now I'm gonna finish it.

1223
01:39:36,704 --> 01:39:38,638
Get the hell out of here.

1224
01:39:38,706 --> 01:39:40,606
Go!

1225
01:39:58,359 --> 01:40:00,520
Whoa! Oooh.

1226
01:40:02,763 --> 01:40:05,664
What a week I'm having!

1227
01:40:20,648 --> 01:40:23,014
Hey, mac, move that thing out of here.

1228
01:40:24,518 --> 01:40:26,816
Up yours, Gomer. I'm waitin' for a fare.

1229
01:40:34,462 --> 01:40:37,056
Heave!

1230
01:40:38,933 --> 01:40:41,197
<i>All right. Move out.</i>

1231
01:40:42,303 --> 01:40:44,567
Come on, let's go!

1232
01:41:10,564 --> 01:41:12,998
- I was ready to stay with you forever.
- I know.

1233
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:16,002
They know who you are.
They won't leave you alone.

1234
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:18,538
I can't ever come back to you.

1235
01:41:18,606 --> 01:41:21,166
I wish I could go with you.

1236
01:41:21,242 --> 01:41:23,540
You can.

1237
01:41:23,611 --> 01:41:26,079
- How?
- It can be done.

1238
01:41:26,146 --> 01:41:30,082
Remember when you were eight
and fell off the ship?

1239
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:32,618
You were safe under
the water, weren't you?

1240
01:41:32,686 --> 01:41:34,881
Yeah.

1241
01:41:34,955 --> 01:41:37,446
You were with me.

1242
01:41:37,525 --> 01:41:40,722
You mean, that was real?

1243
01:41:41,729 --> 01:41:44,254
That was you?

1244
01:41:44,331 --> 01:41:47,095
That was you!

1245
01:41:49,870 --> 01:41:52,566
This is great. This is great!

1246
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:54,938
I can go with you
and still come back...

1247
01:41:55,009 --> 01:41:57,773
and see Freddie at Christmas.

1248
01:41:57,845 --> 01:41:59,870
You can't ever come back.

1249
01:42:13,627 --> 01:42:15,595
Madison.

1250
01:42:18,432 --> 01:42:20,366
I understand.

1251
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:31,770
<i>You on the dock, don't move.</i>

1252
01:42:31,845 --> 01:42:33,836
You're under arrest.

1253
01:42:33,914 --> 01:42:36,075
<i>Let the girl go. Step back.</i>

1254
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:38,243
<i>You're under arrest.</i>

1255
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:40,253
You have to go.

1256
01:42:40,321 --> 01:42:42,687
<i>Move out. Let's go!</i>

1257
01:42:43,691 --> 01:42:45,625
I love you, Madison.

1258
01:42:47,328 --> 01:42:48,852
Go.

1259
01:42:51,098 --> 01:42:53,089
Go!

1260
01:42:59,573 --> 01:43:02,508
<i>Get that guy on the dock.</i>

1261
01:43:03,777 --> 01:43:05,506
Leave her alone!

1262
01:43:08,449 --> 01:43:10,178
Leave her alone!

1263
01:43:20,427 --> 01:43:22,725
Madison.

1264
01:43:29,637 --> 01:43:31,298
Madison!

1265
01:43:41,448 --> 01:43:45,214
Stay where you are. We'll get you out.

1266
01:43:48,055 --> 01:43:50,819
Madison!

1267
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:40,103
Ooo!

1268
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:15,971
<i>One fine day</i>

1269
01:45:17,077 --> 01:45:22,344
<i>Love came for me</i>

1270
01:45:24,084 --> 01:45:28,180
<i>And love was rare</i>

1271
01:45:30,057 --> 01:45:34,118
<i>As love can be</i>

1272
01:45:35,963 --> 01:45:41,094
<i>I saw stars</i>

1273
01:45:41,168 --> 01:45:46,663
<i>Shining in clear blue skies</i>

1274
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:52,508
<i>We flowed together</i>

1275
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:56,879
<i>Once and forever</i>

1276
01:45:59,253 --> 01:46:03,451
<i>Love came for me</i>

1277
01:46:05,292 --> 01:46:08,955
<i>One fine night</i>

1278
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:15,525
<i>Love let us see</i>

1279
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:21,703
<i>How far we'll go</i>

1280
01:46:22,876 --> 01:46:26,505
<i>How good we'll be</i>

1281
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:31,984
<i>We saw a world</i>

1282
01:46:33,654 --> 01:46:39,593
<i>No one ever saw before</i>

1283
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:43,562
<i>It was the world</i>

1284
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:46,963
<i>Love can start</i>

1285
01:46:47,034 --> 01:46:51,767
<i>With a beat of a heart</i>

1286
01:46:51,839 --> 01:46:55,969
<i>Love came for me</i>

1287
01:47:21,034 --> 01:47:24,663
<i>I saw stars</i>

1288
01:47:26,707 --> 01:47:32,668
<i>Shining in clear blue skies</i>

1289
01:47:32,746 --> 01:47:36,113
<i>We flowed together</i>

1290
01:47:38,118 --> 01:47:43,852
<i>Once and forever</i>

1291
01:47:43,924 --> 01:47:48,452
<i>Love came for me</i>

1292
01:47:49,763 --> 01:47:54,029
<i>One fine night</i>

1293
01:47:55,502 --> 01:47:59,962
<i>Love let us see</i>

1294
01:48:01,275 --> 01:48:05,575
<i>How far we'll go</i>

1295
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:12,049
<i>How good we'll be</i>

1296
01:48:13,253 --> 01:48:18,555
<i>We saw a world</i>

1297
01:48:18,625 --> 01:48:25,292
<i>No one ever saw before</i>

1298
01:48:25,365 --> 01:48:28,732
<i>It was the world</i>

1299
01:48:28,802 --> 01:48:32,260
<i>Love can start</i>

1300
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:37,276
<i>With a beat of a heart</i>

1301
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:48,247
<i>Love came for me</i>

1302
01:48:48,322 --> 01:48:53,191
<i>Love came for me</i>
