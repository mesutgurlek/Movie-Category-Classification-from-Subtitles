1
00:00:06,988 --> 00:00:09,783
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

2
00:00:09,908 --> 00:00:12,411
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,503
I pray thee,
good Mercutio, let's retire.

4
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:20,421
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.

5
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:21,798
The day is hot.

6
00:00:21,924 --> 00:00:23,008
Blah, blah, blah.

7
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,012
The Capulets abroad!

8
00:00:26,096 --> 00:00:27,305
Ha ha ha!

9
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:28,515
 

10
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:30,726
If we meet we shall not
'scape a brawl.

11
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:35,607
For now
these hot days,

12
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:37,109
is the mad
blood stirring.

13
00:00:40,197 --> 00:00:41,615
Mercutio,
let's retire.

14
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:45,203
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah!

15
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,623
Thou art like one
of these fellows

16
00:00:47,707 --> 00:00:50,126
that when he enters
the confines of a tavern

17
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,129
claps me his sword
on the table,

18
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:54,631
and says, "God send me
no need of thee:"

19
00:00:54,716 --> 00:00:56,134
blah, blah,
blah, blah;

20
00:00:56,218 --> 00:00:58,137
and by the operation
of the second cup,

21
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,596
draws him on
the drawer,

22
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:01,098
when indeed
there is no need.

23
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:02,600
Am I like
such a fellow?

24
00:01:02,726 --> 00:01:04,102
Nay and there were
two such

25
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:05,604
we should have
none shortly,

26
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,106
for the one would kill
the other.

27
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:09,109
Why thou hast
quarreled with a man

28
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:10,402
for coughing
in the street,

29
00:01:10,527 --> 00:01:13,405
because he hath wakened thy dog
that hath lain asleep

30
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,615
in the sun.

31
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,117
Blah, blah, blah!

32
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:20,122
And thou wilt tutor me
from quarreling! Hah!

33
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:24,628
Mercutio...

34
00:01:24,712 --> 00:01:27,215
By my head,
here come the Capulets.

35
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:35,141
By my heel,
I care not.

36
00:01:37,312 --> 00:01:39,648
 

37
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,123
 

38
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:57,921
Gentlemen, good den.

39
00:01:58,046 --> 00:01:59,631
Good den.

40
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:02,218
A word
with one of you.

41
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:07,141
And but one word
with one of us.

42
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:08,643
Couple it
with something,

43
00:02:08,727 --> 00:02:11,647
make it a word
and a blow.

44
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,150
 

45
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:19,157
You shall find me
apt enough to that, sir,

46
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:20,450
and you will
give me occasion.

47
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:23,829
Can you not take some occasion
without the giving?

48
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,961
Mercutio, thou
consortest with Romeo.

49
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:31,631
Consort? Ha ha ha!

50
00:02:31,756 --> 00:02:33,925
What dost thou
make us minstrels?

51
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:35,427
Ha ha ha!

52
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:37,138
An you make
minstrels of us,

53
00:02:37,263 --> 00:02:39,641
you look to hear
nothing but discords.

54
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:42,436
Here's my fiddlestick.

55
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,731
Here's that shall
make you dance.

56
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,066
Zounds! Consort!

57
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,653
We talk here in
the public haunt of men.

58
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:50,655
Either withdraw unto
some private place,

59
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:52,658
or reason coldly
of your grievances,

60
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:54,159
or else depart;

61
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:56,162
here all eyes gaze on us.

62
00:02:56,246 --> 00:02:58,665
Men's eyes
were made to look,

63
00:02:58,749 --> 00:03:00,167
and let them gaze.

64
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:01,669
Mercutio!

65
00:03:01,753 --> 00:03:03,171
I will not budge for
no man's pleasure, I.

66
00:03:03,255 --> 00:03:06,634
Well, peace be
with you, sir,

67
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,636
here comes my man.

68
00:03:08,637 --> 00:03:11,557
Mercutio!

69
00:03:20,652 --> 00:03:22,070
Tybalt.

70
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,573
Romeo, the love
I bear thee

71
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:26,743
can afford no better
term than this--

72
00:03:26,868 --> 00:03:28,244
thou art a villain.

73
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,663
 

74
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:33,168
Tybalt, the reason that
I have to love thee

75
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:35,754
doth much excuse
the appertaining rage

76
00:03:35,755 --> 00:03:37,256
to such a greeting--

77
00:03:37,256 --> 00:03:39,258
villain am I none.

78
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:40,760
Therefore farewell,

79
00:03:40,844 --> 00:03:42,763
I see thou knowest
not me.

80
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,557
Ha ha ha!

81
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,186
Boy...

82
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:51,148
This shall not excuse the injuries
thou hast done me,

83
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:53,652
therefore turn
and draw.

84
00:03:53,778 --> 00:03:56,656
I do protest
I never injured thee,

85
00:03:56,781 --> 00:03:59,451
but love thee better
than thou canst devise.

86
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:02,162
Till thou shalt know
the reason of my love.

87
00:04:02,288 --> 00:04:03,664
And so, good Capulet,

88
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:09,088
which name I tender
as dearly as mine own,

89
00:04:09,172 --> 00:04:11,675
be satisfied.

90
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,971
 

91
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,890
Ha ha ha!

92
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:20,394
No, no.

93
00:04:27,696 --> 00:04:29,656
Ugh!

94
00:04:29,657 --> 00:04:31,158
Ugh!

95
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:33,662
 

96
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:38,167
Ha ha ha!

97
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,671
  No, Mercutio.

98
00:04:41,797 --> 00:04:43,674
O calm, dishonorable,
vile submission!

99
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,176
No, Mercutio, no!

100
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:46,678
Leave me...

101
00:04:46,762 --> 00:04:48,681
Tybalt, you ratcatcher!

102
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:51,392
What wouldest thou
have with me?

103
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:52,894
Good King of Cats,

104
00:04:52,895 --> 00:04:55,690
nothing but one of
your nine lives,

105
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:57,900
that I mean to
make bold withal...

106
00:04:57,985 --> 00:05:00,905
And as you shall
use me hereafter...

107
00:05:00,988 --> 00:05:03,366
Dry-beat the rest
of the eight.

108
00:05:03,492 --> 00:05:05,703
Please, good Mercutio.

109
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:09,207
Will you pluck your sword
out of his pilcher

110
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,709
by the ears?

111
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:12,169
Make haste,

112
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:15,674
lest mine be about your ears
ere it be out.

113
00:05:22,182 --> 00:05:23,809
I am for you, sir.

114
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:25,311
Ha ha ha!

115
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:27,689
Gentle Mercutio,
put thy rapier up.

116
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:31,193
Come, come.

117
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:35,198
 

118
00:05:39,496 --> 00:05:41,206
Benvolio, beat down
their weapons!

119
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:43,208
Gentlemen, for shame!
Forbear this outrage!

120
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,712
The Prince expressly hath
forbid this bandying

121
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,213
in Verona streets.

122
00:05:47,298 --> 00:05:49,217
Tybalt!

123
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,385
Mercutio!

124
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:53,596
Leave us!

125
00:05:53,722 --> 00:05:55,599
Leave us away,
you coward!

126
00:05:55,683 --> 00:05:56,600
Go hang thyself.

127
00:05:56,685 --> 00:05:58,687
 

128
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:03,192
 

129
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:09,200
Uh!

130
00:06:09,326 --> 00:06:10,702
 
Ha ha ha!

131
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,500
 

132
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:35,901
 

133
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:39,196
Ha ha ha! Hey!

134
00:06:39,322 --> 00:06:40,698
Ha ha ha!

135
00:06:40,824 --> 00:06:42,701
 

136
00:06:44,996 --> 00:06:47,207
 

137
00:06:51,838 --> 00:06:53,006
Ha ha ha!

138
00:06:53,006 --> 00:06:54,716
Hey!

139
00:06:58,305 --> 00:06:59,806
Aah!

140
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:01,809
Cut his hair, Tybalt!

141
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:03,728
 

142
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:08,317
Ha ha ha!

143
00:07:19,332 --> 00:07:21,209
Hey!

144
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:23,712
Keep your distance, Tybalt.

145
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,010
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

146
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:30,721
 

147
00:07:32,348 --> 00:07:35,226
Keep away, coward!

148
00:07:37,146 --> 00:07:41,443
Make haste, Tybalt,
we cannot wait all day.

149
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:46,950
Ah, mother's baby
has dropped his sword.

150
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,243
 

151
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:50,037
Hey!

152
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:54,543
Tybalt, no!

153
00:07:54,627 --> 00:07:57,755
Abstain from
this crusade!

154
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,257
Tybalt, go!

155
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:01,218
Mercutio, come down!

156
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,361
Begone, begone...

157
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,240
Fly, Tybalt.
Fly away.

158
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:23,747
 

159
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:28,127
I am hurt.

160
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,269
Uh!

161
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:43,063
I am hurt.

162
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,857
  What! Art thou hurt?

163
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,237
A scratch, a scratch,

164
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,364
marry 'tis enough.

165
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:53,368
Courage, man, the hurt
cannot be much.

166
00:08:53,452 --> 00:08:57,248
No, 'tis not so deep
as a well,

167
00:08:57,374 --> 00:09:00,252
nor so wide as
a church door,

168
00:09:00,336 --> 00:09:01,754
but 'tis enough;

169
00:09:01,838 --> 00:09:03,757
you ask for me
tomorrow,

170
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,760
and you shall find me
a grave man.

171
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:08,137
 

172
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:10,765
Where is my page?

173
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:13,852
Go, villain,
and fetch me a surgeon.

174
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,354
Fetch me a surgeon!

175
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,357
Ha ha ha!

176
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:18,942
Did he hurt you?

177
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,754
Why the devil
came you between us?

178
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,258
I was hurt
under your arm.

179
00:09:37,383 --> 00:09:41,262
I thought all
for the best, I...

180
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,272
 

181
00:09:49,357 --> 00:09:51,776
Help me into some house,
Benvolio,

182
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,153
or I shall faint.

183
00:09:57,867 --> 00:09:59,786
  Whoa!

184
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,288
Whoa!

185
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:03,291
Whoa!

186
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,793
Whoa!

187
00:10:04,876 --> 00:10:06,252
Yay!

188
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,259
A plague o'
both your houses!

189
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:20,271
They have made
worms' meat of me.

190
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,276
I have it,

191
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,779
and soundly too...

192
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:31,494
Your houses!

193
00:10:31,494 --> 00:10:33,079
He jests!

194
00:10:34,873 --> 00:10:36,792
Mercutio!

195
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:38,795
 

196
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,301
Romeo, Romeo...

197
00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:46,304
brave Mercutio's dead.

198
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:49,266
 

199
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:10,293
This day's black fate,

200
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:12,588
on more days doth depend.

201
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:17,177
This but begins the woe
others must end.

202
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,305
He gone in triumph!

203
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:22,809
And Mercutio slain!

204
00:11:22,893 --> 00:11:27,315
Away to heaven,
respective lenity,

205
00:11:27,398 --> 00:11:30,193
and fire-eyed fury
be my conduct now!

206
00:11:30,277 --> 00:11:32,279
 

207
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:33,781
Tybalt!

208
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:37,912
Tybalt!

209
00:11:37,912 --> 00:11:40,290
Romeo!

210
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,297
Tybalt!

211
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:47,799
Romeo!

212
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:52,597
This way!

213
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:54,807
Tybalt!

214
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:57,311
Romeo!

215
00:11:57,395 --> 00:11:59,814
Tybalt!

216
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:08,826
Now, Tybalt...

217
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,829
Take the villain
back again,

218
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:13,290
that late thou gav'st me;

219
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,792
for Mercutio's soul

220
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:17,795
is but a little way
above our heads,

221
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:20,799
staying for thine
to keep him company:

222
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,303
either thou, or l, or both,

223
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:24,804
must go with him!

224
00:12:24,805 --> 00:12:26,807
Aah!

225
00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:33,733
Let him go!
Let him go!

226
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:42,327
Sword, Romeo.

227
00:12:44,121 --> 00:12:45,622
O thou wretched boy,

228
00:12:45,623 --> 00:12:47,625
that didst
consort him here,

229
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:49,127
shalt with him hence.

230
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,837
This shall
determine that.

231
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,233
Hit the feet, Romeo!

232
00:13:07,735 --> 00:13:10,446
Protect the eyes, Romeo!

233
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,243
 

234
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:21,419
Give me your sword.

235
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:37,147
Watch his feet!

236
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:41,152
 

237
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:10,231
Hyah!

238
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:15,237
 

239
00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:26,168
  Give me the sword!

240
00:14:26,252 --> 00:14:27,545
The sword!

241
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:29,547
The sword!

242
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:31,133
 

243
00:15:01,964 --> 00:15:03,465
Romeo! Romeo!

244
00:15:26,162 --> 00:15:27,163
  The sword!

245
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:29,081
The sword!

246
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,667
Give it to me!

247
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:32,252
Your sword, Romeo!

248
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:33,879
The sword, Romeo!

249
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:38,051
 

250
00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:39,887
Aah!

251
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:41,681
 

252
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:48,189
Tybalt!

253
00:15:48,273 --> 00:15:50,066
 

254
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:56,075
Romeo, away, be gone.

255
00:15:56,158 --> 00:15:57,576
The citizens are up.

256
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,078
Stand not amazed,

257
00:15:59,162 --> 00:16:01,164
the Prince will
doom thee death,

258
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:02,458
if thou art taken.

259
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,084
Hence, go away!

260
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:05,670
Romeo!

261
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:13,680
Oh, I am fortune's fool!

262
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,768
Oh, Romeo!
Away, away!

263
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:25,195
A curse on the Montagues!

264
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:28,490
Oh, Tybalt!

265
00:16:28,575 --> 00:16:30,202
Tybalt! Tybalt!

266
00:16:30,202 --> 00:16:32,204
The best friend I had,

267
00:16:32,288 --> 00:16:35,375
oh, courteous Tybalt,
honest gentleman,

268
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,004
that ever I should live
to see thee dead!

269
00:16:39,005 --> 00:16:40,173
Oh, God!

270
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:42,175
Did Romeo's hand
shed Tybalt's blood?

271
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,179
It did, it did,
alas the day, it did!

272
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,680
Oh, nurse,

273
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:51,186
oh, serpent heart,
hid with a flow'ring face!

274
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,190
Was ever book containing
such vile matter

275
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:56,193
so fairly bound?

276
00:16:56,277 --> 00:16:58,196
 

277
00:17:01,283 --> 00:17:03,202
There's no faith,
no trust,

278
00:17:03,286 --> 00:17:04,704
no honesty in men;

279
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:07,207
all perjured,
all forsworn,

280
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,710
all naught,
all dissemblers.

281
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:11,587
Shame come to Romeo.

282
00:17:11,713 --> 00:17:15,175
Blistered be thy tongue
for such a wish.

283
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,679
He was not born
to shame.

284
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:20,515
Upon his brow shame
is ashamed to sit.

285
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,102
Will you speak well of him
that killed your cousin?

286
00:17:23,186 --> 00:17:26,690
Shall I speak ill of him
that is my husband?

287
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:28,192
 

288
00:17:28,193 --> 00:17:30,696
 

289
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:33,199
Poor my lord,

290
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:35,702
what tongue shall
smooth thy name

291
00:17:35,702 --> 00:17:38,205
when I
thy three-hours wife

292
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:40,291
have mangled it?

293
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,002
 

294
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:46,508
But wherefore villain,
didst thou kill my cousin?

295
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:49,302
Capulet! To the prince!

296
00:17:49,386 --> 00:17:50,721
 

297
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,132
Speak, Benvolio, speak!

298
00:18:23,805 --> 00:18:25,724
Go on, speak.

299
00:18:25,808 --> 00:18:27,727
Prince!
As thou art true,

300
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,021
for blood of ours
shed blood of Montague.

301
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:33,233
 

302
00:18:33,234 --> 00:18:36,237
Benvolio, who began
this bloody fray?

303
00:18:36,238 --> 00:18:37,823
Tybalt, here slain.

304
00:18:37,907 --> 00:18:39,700
  No!

305
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:43,205
Romeo did
speak him fair,

306
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,208
bid him bethink how nice
the quarrel was,

307
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,127
and urged withal
your high displeasure.

308
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:49,504
It's true, Prince.

309
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,215
The picture
makes him false.

310
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,716
He speaks not true.

311
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:54,844
 

312
00:18:58,516 --> 00:18:59,934
I beg for justice,

313
00:19:00,018 --> 00:19:02,729
which thou,
Prince must give.

314
00:19:02,813 --> 00:19:07,819
Romeo slew Tybalt,
Romeo must not live.

315
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:10,448
 

316
00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:12,451
Romeo slew him.

317
00:19:23,214 --> 00:19:25,049
He slew Mercutio.

318
00:19:31,725 --> 00:19:35,521
Who now the price
of his dear blood doth owe?

319
00:19:40,236 --> 00:19:42,739
Not Romeo, Prince...

320
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:45,242
He was Mercutio's friend.

321
00:19:45,243 --> 00:19:49,248
His fault concludes
but what the law should end.

322
00:19:49,248 --> 00:19:51,333
The life of Tybalt!

323
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:52,752
And for that offense,

324
00:19:52,836 --> 00:19:54,254
immediately we do
exile him hence.

325
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,761
  Let Romeo
hence in haste,

326
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:02,264
else, when he's found...

327
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:05,435
That hour is his last.

328
00:20:18,243 --> 00:20:20,162
 

329
00:20:20,246 --> 00:20:22,665
Ah, banishment...

330
00:20:22,749 --> 00:20:24,167
Be merciful, say death!

331
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:25,669
 

332
00:20:25,753 --> 00:20:27,838
Do not say banishment.

333
00:20:27,964 --> 00:20:29,132
Arise.

334
00:20:29,257 --> 00:20:32,260
One knocks;
good Romeo, hide thyself.

335
00:20:32,261 --> 00:20:33,554
Who's there?

336
00:20:33,554 --> 00:20:34,763
 

337
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:37,267
Who knocks so hard?

338
00:20:37,267 --> 00:20:39,770
Whence come you?

339
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,271
What's your will?

340
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:43,274
  Let me come in,

341
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,736
and you shall know
my errand.

342
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:47,738
I come from
Lady Juliet.

343
00:20:47,739 --> 00:20:50,242
 

344
00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:52,244
Welcome then.

345
00:20:52,245 --> 00:20:54,748
Holy friar,
o tell me, holy friar,

346
00:20:54,748 --> 00:20:56,750
where's my lady's lord,
where's Romeo?

347
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:59,462
There, on the ground.

348
00:20:59,546 --> 00:21:01,047
With his own tears
made drunk.

349
00:21:01,048 --> 00:21:04,761
  There is no world
without Verona walls.

350
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:07,263
Even so lies she,

351
00:21:07,347 --> 00:21:08,765
blubbering and weeping,

352
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:10,267
weeping and blubbering.

353
00:21:10,351 --> 00:21:11,769
 

354
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,271
Stand up!

355
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,776
Stand and you
be a man.

356
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,154
For Juliet's sake,
for her sake,

357
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,655
rise and stand.

358
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:24,160
Why should you fall
into so deep an 'ole?

359
00:21:24,286 --> 00:21:25,662
Nurse.

360
00:21:25,788 --> 00:21:28,666
Ah, sir, death's
the end of all.

361
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,168
Speakst thou of Juliet?

362
00:21:30,252 --> 00:21:31,670
How is it with her?

363
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:34,257
Does she not think
me an old murderer?

364
00:21:34,257 --> 00:21:36,760
Where is she?
How doth she?

365
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,261
What says
my concealed lady

366
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:39,763
to our canceled love?

367
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:42,767
She says nothing, sir,
but weeps and weeps,

368
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,979
and Tybalt calls,
and then on Romeo cries.

369
00:21:45,062 --> 00:21:47,982
As if that name
did murder her.

370
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:50,777
O tell me, friar,
tell me,

371
00:21:50,778 --> 00:21:53,781
in what vile part
of this anatomy

372
00:21:53,782 --> 00:21:55,283
doth my name lodge?

373
00:21:55,284 --> 00:21:59,497
Tell me that I may sack
the hateful mansion!

374
00:21:59,497 --> 00:22:00,790
 

375
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,292
Hold thy
desperate hand.

376
00:22:02,293 --> 00:22:03,794
By heavens!
Leave it!

377
00:22:06,882 --> 00:22:09,301
Thou hast amazed me.

378
00:22:09,385 --> 00:22:11,262
Thou a man?

379
00:22:11,387 --> 00:22:13,765
Thy form
cries out thou art.

380
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:15,768
Thy tears
are womanish,

381
00:22:15,893 --> 00:22:19,689
thy wild acts denote the
unreasonable fury of a beast.

382
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:21,692
Hast thou slain Tybalt?

383
00:22:21,776 --> 00:22:24,195
Wilt thou slay thyself,
and slay thy lady,

384
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,697
that in thy life lives,

385
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:27,199
by doing damned hate
upon thyself?

386
00:22:27,283 --> 00:22:29,702
Rouse thee, man...

387
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:33,207
Thy Juliet is alive.

388
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,668
There art thou happy.

389
00:22:35,794 --> 00:22:37,170
Tybalt would kill thee,

390
00:22:37,296 --> 00:22:38,672
but thou slewest Tybalt;

391
00:22:38,797 --> 00:22:40,173
there art thou happy.

392
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:43,302
The law that threatened death
becomes thy friend,

393
00:22:43,303 --> 00:22:45,180
and turns it to exile;

394
00:22:45,181 --> 00:22:46,682
there art thou happy.

395
00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:50,312
A pack of blessings
light upon thy back...

396
00:22:52,774 --> 00:22:55,402
Ascend her chamber,
hence and comfort her.

397
00:22:56,779 --> 00:23:00,283
But look thou stay
not till the watch be set,

398
00:23:00,283 --> 00:23:02,786
for then thou canst not
pass to Mantua,

399
00:23:02,786 --> 00:23:05,789
where thou shalt live
till we find a time

400
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,293
to blaze your marriage,
reconcile your friends,

401
00:23:08,293 --> 00:23:11,296
beg pardon of the Prince,
and call thee home,

402
00:23:11,297 --> 00:23:14,300
with twenty hundred
thousand times more joy

403
00:23:14,385 --> 00:23:16,387
than thou wentest forth
in lamentation.

404
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,184
Go before, nurse...

405
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,686
Commend me to thy lady,

406
00:23:22,812 --> 00:23:25,690
and bid her hasten
all the house to bed,

407
00:23:25,816 --> 00:23:28,694
which heavy sorrow
makes them apt unto

408
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,697
Romeo's coming.

409
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:26,101
 

410
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:39,236
Wilt thou be gone?

411
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:46,745
It is not yet
near day.

412
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:49,749
It was the nightingale,
and not the lark,

413
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,756
that pierced the fearful hollow
of thine ear.

414
00:25:54,756 --> 00:25:57,843
Nightly she sings
on yond pomegranate tree.

415
00:25:57,843 --> 00:26:00,262
Oh, believe me, love,

416
00:26:00,263 --> 00:26:03,767
it was the nightingale.

417
00:26:03,851 --> 00:26:06,729
It was the lark...

418
00:26:06,855 --> 00:26:09,733
The herald of the morn,

419
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,736
no nightingale.

420
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:18,244
Night's candles
are burnt out...

421
00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:31,761
And jocund day stands tiptoe
on the misty mountaintops.

422
00:26:34,348 --> 00:26:37,268
I must be gone and live,

423
00:26:37,352 --> 00:26:39,563
or stay and die.

424
00:26:41,357 --> 00:26:45,278
Yond light is not
daylight...

425
00:26:45,362 --> 00:26:48,240
I know it, I.

426
00:26:50,869 --> 00:26:53,163
Therefore stay yet,

427
00:26:53,164 --> 00:26:56,251
thou needst not
to be gone.

428
00:26:56,376 --> 00:26:57,752
Oh, let me be taken,

429
00:26:57,878 --> 00:27:00,256
let me be put to death.

430
00:27:00,381 --> 00:27:03,259
I am content so thou
wilt have it so.

431
00:27:03,385 --> 00:27:06,263
I'll say yon gray
is not the morning's eye,

432
00:27:06,347 --> 00:27:08,266
nor that is not
the lark

433
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,853
whose notes do beat
the vaulty heavens

434
00:27:10,853 --> 00:27:12,188
so high above
our heads.

435
00:27:12,272 --> 00:27:17,361
I have more care
to stay than will to go.

436
00:27:17,362 --> 00:27:20,783
Come death, and welcome,
Juliet wills it so.

437
00:27:20,866 --> 00:27:23,285
 

438
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:25,788
It is...

439
00:27:25,872 --> 00:27:28,667
It is, hie hence,
be gone away.

440
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:31,671
Romeo, it is.

441
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:38,763
It is the lark that
sings so out of tune,

442
00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:43,269
straining harsh discords,
and unpleasing sharps.

443
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:46,273
Some say the lark
makes sweet division;

444
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:50,278
oh, this doth not so,
for she divideth us.

445
00:27:50,362 --> 00:27:51,780
So now be gone,

446
00:27:51,864 --> 00:27:53,991
more light and light
it grows.

447
00:27:54,075 --> 00:27:55,493
More light and light,

448
00:27:55,577 --> 00:28:00,291
more dark and dark
our woes.

449
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:02,377
 

450
00:28:02,502 --> 00:28:03,795
  Madam!

451
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:06,799
Your lady mother
comes to your chamber.

452
00:28:08,886 --> 00:28:10,304
Nurse.

453
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,266
Your lady mother is
coming to your chamber.

454
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,268
The day is broke,
look about.

455
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,774
Oh, art thou gone so,

456
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,276
my husband, friend?

457
00:28:21,402 --> 00:28:24,781
I must hear from thee
every day in the hour,

458
00:28:24,906 --> 00:28:27,284
for in a minute
there are many days,

459
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:30,788
o by this count
I shall be much in years,

460
00:28:30,872 --> 00:28:32,791
ere I again behold my Romeo.

461
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,794
I will omit
no opportunity

462
00:28:34,877 --> 00:28:37,296
that may convey
my greetings, love, to thee.

463
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,804
Oh, think'st thou
we shall ever meet again?

464
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,309
I doubt it not,

465
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,812
and all these woes
shall serve

466
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:53,275
for sweet discourses
in our time to come.

467
00:28:55,403 --> 00:28:59,282
Farewell, farewell,

468
00:28:59,408 --> 00:29:01,786
one kiss
and I'll descend.

469
00:29:06,918 --> 00:29:09,796
 

470
00:29:25,901 --> 00:29:27,319
Adieu.

471
00:29:32,618 --> 00:29:35,621
Adieu!

472
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:40,294
 

473
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:43,214
Oh, God!

474
00:30:02,197 --> 00:30:04,324
 

475
00:30:04,408 --> 00:30:07,328
We will have vengeance
for it,

476
00:30:07,412 --> 00:30:08,830
fear thou not...

477
00:30:08,914 --> 00:30:11,333
  No!

478
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:12,835
Then weep no more.

479
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:14,337
 

480
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:21,305
I'll send to one
in Mantua,

481
00:30:21,305 --> 00:30:24,308
where that same
banished runagate doth live

482
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:28,814
shall give him such
an unaccustomed dram,

483
00:30:28,939 --> 00:30:31,817
that he shall soon
keep Tybalt company.

484
00:30:31,943 --> 00:30:34,321
  No!

485
00:30:34,405 --> 00:30:38,326
But now I'll tell thee
joyful tidings, girl.

486
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:41,831
Well, then thou hast
a careful father,

487
00:30:41,914 --> 00:30:44,834
one who to put thee
from thy heaviness

488
00:30:44,918 --> 00:30:47,337
hath sorted out
a sudden day of joy.

489
00:30:49,424 --> 00:30:52,845
And joy comes well
in such a needy time.

490
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:55,848
Marry, my child,
early next Thursday morn,

491
00:30:55,932 --> 00:30:58,351
the gallant, young
and noble prince,

492
00:30:58,435 --> 00:31:01,313
the county Paris,
at St. Peter's church,

493
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:04,317
shall happily make thee
there a joyful bride.

494
00:31:05,945 --> 00:31:09,824
Now by St. Peter's church,
and Peter too,

495
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,330
he shall not make me there
a joyful bride!

496
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,750
No! No!

497
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:22,424
So, it is concluded.

498
00:31:25,845 --> 00:31:29,432
Son, Paris.

499
00:31:32,562 --> 00:31:36,650
How now, wife, have you
delivered to her our decree?

500
00:31:36,734 --> 00:31:39,362
Ay, sir,
but she will none,

501
00:31:39,446 --> 00:31:41,365
she gives you thanks.

502
00:31:41,449 --> 00:31:42,658
 

503
00:31:42,742 --> 00:31:46,163
I would the fool were
married to her grave.

504
00:31:47,957 --> 00:31:52,337
Soft...
take me with you.

505
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:56,343
Take me with you, wife.

506
00:31:56,468 --> 00:31:58,846
How? Will she none?

507
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:01,348
Doth she not
give us thanks?

508
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:03,852
Is she not proud?

509
00:32:03,936 --> 00:32:07,357
Doth she not count her blessed,
unworthy as she is,

510
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,945
that we have wrought so worthy
a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

511
00:32:11,946 --> 00:32:14,449
Wretched fool!
Let me see her!

512
00:32:14,574 --> 00:32:15,950
Ungrateful baggage!

513
00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:19,372
Say what thou wilt,
thou shalt not house with me!

514
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,041
Fie! What, are you mad?

515
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:22,876
Hang thee,
young baggage!

516
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,044
Disobedient wretch!

517
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:27,340
I tell thee what,
get thee to church on Thursday,

518
00:32:27,466 --> 00:32:30,344
or never after
look me in the face.

519
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,848
Oh, father, good father,
I beseech you.

520
00:32:32,973 --> 00:32:35,351
Speak not, reply not,
do not answer me.

521
00:32:35,476 --> 00:32:36,852
My fingers itch.

522
00:32:36,978 --> 00:32:39,856
You are to blame, my lord,
to rate her so.

523
00:32:39,982 --> 00:32:41,358
And why,
my lady wisdom?

524
00:32:41,442 --> 00:32:42,860
Hold your tongue!

525
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:45,363
Good prudence, smatter
with your gossips, go!

526
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:46,865
I speak no treason.

527
00:32:46,949 --> 00:32:48,367
May not one speak?

528
00:32:48,451 --> 00:32:49,869
Speak!
You mumbling fool!

529
00:32:49,953 --> 00:32:51,872
Utter your gravity
o'er a gossip's bowl,

530
00:32:51,955 --> 00:32:53,373
for here we need it not.

531
00:32:53,457 --> 00:32:54,875
You are too hot.

532
00:32:54,876 --> 00:32:56,377
 

533
00:32:56,461 --> 00:32:59,256
God's bread,
it makes me mad.

534
00:33:02,469 --> 00:33:03,553
Thursday's near.

535
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,848
Lay hand on heart, advise.

536
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:08,976
An you be mine,
I give you to my friend;

537
00:33:09,061 --> 00:33:10,354
an you be not,

538
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:13,274
hang, beg, starve,
die in the streets.

539
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:14,358
No!

540
00:33:14,484 --> 00:33:16,987
For by my soul,
I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,

541
00:33:17,071 --> 00:33:20,074
for what is mine
shall never do thee good.

542
00:33:20,158 --> 00:33:21,367
Father!

543
00:33:21,493 --> 00:33:26,374
Trust to't, bethink you,
I'll not be forsworn.

544
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:27,959
 

545
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:36,094
Oh, no! No!

546
00:33:36,095 --> 00:33:38,890
Oh sweet, my mother,
cast me not away.

547
00:33:38,974 --> 00:33:41,393
Delay this marriage
for a month, a week, oh!

548
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:44,480
Talk not to me,
for I'll not speak a word.

549
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:49,862
Do as thou wilt,
for I have done with thee.

550
00:33:53,492 --> 00:33:56,787
Oh, God!

551
00:33:56,872 --> 00:33:57,873
Oh, nurse?

552
00:33:57,998 --> 00:33:59,875
How shall this
be prevented?

553
00:34:00,001 --> 00:34:01,878
What sayest thou?

554
00:34:02,003 --> 00:34:04,881
Hast thou not
a word of joy?

555
00:34:04,965 --> 00:34:07,301
Some comfort, nurse.

556
00:34:07,302 --> 00:34:09,888
Faith, here it is.

557
00:34:09,972 --> 00:34:12,391
Romeo is banished...

558
00:34:14,477 --> 00:34:16,896
And all the world
to nothing,

559
00:34:16,897 --> 00:34:19,900
that he dares ne'er come back
to challenge you;

560
00:34:19,901 --> 00:34:23,906
or if he do, it needs must
be by stealth.

561
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:28,412
Then since the case so stands
as now it doth,

562
00:34:28,495 --> 00:34:33,292
I think it best
you marry with the county.

563
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,391
True.

564
00:34:46,977 --> 00:34:49,897
O he's a lovely
gentleman.

565
00:34:53,402 --> 00:34:56,489
Romeo's
a dishclout to him.

566
00:34:57,908 --> 00:35:00,786
An eagle, madam,
hath not so green,

567
00:35:00,912 --> 00:35:04,291
so quick, so fair an eye
as Paris hath.

568
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:05,792
Beshrew my heart,

569
00:35:05,918 --> 00:35:09,297
I think you happy
in this second match.

570
00:35:09,423 --> 00:35:12,093
It excels your first.

571
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,224
For if it did not,
your first is dead,

572
00:35:17,308 --> 00:35:20,311
or 'twere as good he were
as living here,

573
00:35:20,312 --> 00:35:23,315
and you no use of him.

574
00:35:23,315 --> 00:35:26,110
Speakest thou
from thy heart?

575
00:35:30,324 --> 00:35:32,409
And from my soul, too...

576
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,832
Or else
beshrew them both.

577
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,293
Amen.

578
00:35:38,293 --> 00:35:39,294
 

579
00:35:39,294 --> 00:35:40,795
What?

580
00:35:40,796 --> 00:35:45,593
Well, thou hast comforted me
marvelous much.

581
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:52,310
Go in, and tell my lady
I am gone,

582
00:35:52,436 --> 00:35:53,812
having displeased my father,

583
00:35:53,896 --> 00:35:55,815
to Laurence's cell,

584
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:58,819
to make confession
and to be absolved.

585
00:36:00,238 --> 00:36:04,326
Marry, I shall,
and this is wisely done.

586
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,828
Go!

587
00:36:35,741 --> 00:36:38,744
You say you do not know
the lady's mind.

588
00:36:38,745 --> 00:36:41,748
Uneven is the course,
I like it not.

589
00:36:41,749 --> 00:36:44,252
Immoderately she weeps
for Tybalt's death,

590
00:36:44,252 --> 00:36:46,713
and therefore have I
little talked of love,

591
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:49,717
for Venus smiles not
in a house of tears.

592
00:36:49,843 --> 00:36:51,052
 

593
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,726
Oh!

594
00:37:00,857 --> 00:37:03,819
Happily met,
my lady and my wife.

595
00:37:06,322 --> 00:37:10,118
That may be, sir,
when I may be a wife.

596
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,250
Come you to make
confession to this father?

597
00:37:17,753 --> 00:37:20,131
Are you at leisure,
holy father, now,

598
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:23,051
or shall I come to you
at evening mass?

599
00:37:23,135 --> 00:37:25,346
My leisure serves me,
pensive daughter, now.

600
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,933
My lord, we must entreat
the time alone.

601
00:37:28,058 --> 00:37:30,728
God shield I should
disturb devotion.

602
00:37:30,728 --> 00:37:34,149
Juliet, on Thursday early
will I rouse thee.

603
00:37:35,734 --> 00:37:38,237
Till then, adieu...

604
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,744
and keep this holy kiss.

605
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,253
 

606
00:37:51,254 --> 00:37:55,050
Oh, shut the door,
and when thou hast done so,

607
00:37:55,134 --> 00:37:57,762
come weep with me,
past hope,

608
00:37:57,846 --> 00:38:01,433
past care, past help.

609
00:38:11,363 --> 00:38:14,241
Oh, Juliet, I already
know thy grief.

610
00:38:14,367 --> 00:38:17,162
Tell me not, Friar,
that thou heard'st of this,

611
00:38:17,246 --> 00:38:20,166
unless thou tell me
how I can prevent it.

612
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,671
If in thy wisdom
thou cans't give no help...

613
00:38:23,754 --> 00:38:25,673
 

614
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,855
Hold, daughter.

615
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,780
I do spy a kind of hope,

616
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:47,284
as that is desperate
which we would prevent.

617
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:53,250
If rather than to marry
county Paris,

618
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,252
thou hast
the strength of will to--

619
00:38:55,253 --> 00:38:57,255
O bid me leap,
rather than marry Paris,

620
00:38:57,255 --> 00:38:58,756
from off the battlements
of any tower,

621
00:38:58,757 --> 00:39:00,550
or bid me go
into a new-made grave

622
00:39:00,676 --> 00:39:03,262
and hide me with a dead man
in his shroud.

623
00:39:03,388 --> 00:39:04,389
Hold then.

624
00:39:17,573 --> 00:39:18,657
Go home.

625
00:39:20,285 --> 00:39:21,661
Be merry.

626
00:39:24,457 --> 00:39:26,668
Give consent
to marry Paris.

627
00:39:26,793 --> 00:39:28,169
Oh, no.

628
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,090
Wednesday is tomorrow.

629
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,763
Tomorrow night
look that thou lie alone,

630
00:39:36,764 --> 00:39:40,393
let not the nurse
lie with thee in thy chamber.

631
00:39:48,779 --> 00:39:52,366
Take thou this phial,
being then in bed...

632
00:39:54,787 --> 00:40:00,878
And this distilling liquor
drink thou off...

633
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:06,802
When presently through
all thy veins shall run

634
00:40:06,886 --> 00:40:09,681
a cold and drowsy humor;,

635
00:40:09,806 --> 00:40:14,186
for no pulse shall keep
his native progress,

636
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:15,688
but surcease;

637
00:40:15,772 --> 00:40:21,279
no warmth, no breath
shall testify thou livest...

638
00:40:25,201 --> 00:40:28,204
And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death

639
00:40:28,288 --> 00:40:34,212
thou shalt continue
two and forty hours...

640
00:40:40,178 --> 00:40:44,808
And then awake
as from a pleasant sleep.

641
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:52,819
In the meantime,
against thou shalt awake

642
00:40:52,903 --> 00:40:56,198
shall Romeo by my letters
know our drift,

643
00:40:56,324 --> 00:40:58,201
and hither shall he come,

644
00:40:58,285 --> 00:41:00,704
and he and I
will watch thy waking,

645
00:41:00,788 --> 00:41:05,418
and that very night shall Romeo
bear thee hence to Mantua.

646
00:41:07,296 --> 00:41:08,797
Give me, give me!

647
00:41:08,923 --> 00:41:11,092
Tell me not of fear.

648
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,011
Hold, then.

649
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:23,191
Get thee gone.

650
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:25,695
Be strong and prosperous
in this resolve.

651
00:42:02,325 --> 00:42:04,202
How now, my headstrong.

652
00:42:04,327 --> 00:42:06,204
Where have you
been gadding?

653
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,207
Where I have learnt me

654
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:10,711
to repent the sin
of disobedient opposition.

655
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:14,715
Pardon me,
henceforward l,

656
00:42:14,841 --> 00:42:18,136
I am ever ruled by you.

657
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,140
Why, I am glad on't!

658
00:42:21,224 --> 00:42:23,727
This is well.
Stand up.

659
00:42:23,727 --> 00:42:26,021
This is
as it should be.

660
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:05,446
Love give me strength.

661
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:34,233
Give this letter
into the hand of Romeo,

662
00:43:34,234 --> 00:43:35,360
in Mantua.

663
00:44:04,856 --> 00:44:07,275
 

664
00:44:10,363 --> 00:44:12,240
Aah!

665
00:44:12,366 --> 00:44:13,742
My lord! My lord!

666
00:44:13,868 --> 00:44:17,581
She's dead,
Juliet is dead!

667
00:44:17,664 --> 00:44:20,459
My Lady Juliet, my lord.
She's dead, she's dead!

668
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,170
Juliet!

669
00:44:22,254 --> 00:44:23,964
Juliet!

670
00:44:24,048 --> 00:44:25,967
Juliet!

671
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:28,052
My baby,
where is she?

672
00:44:30,764 --> 00:44:34,685
  O lamentable day.

673
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:38,775
Death lies on her
like an untimely frost

674
00:44:38,775 --> 00:44:43,572
upon the sweetest flower
of all the field.

675
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:53,251
 

676
00:45:58,793 --> 00:46:01,296
 

677
00:46:37,301 --> 00:46:38,802
 

678
00:46:58,286 --> 00:46:59,996
Master.

679
00:47:00,122 --> 00:47:01,623
Balthasar!

680
00:47:04,794 --> 00:47:06,295
How fares my Juliet?

681
00:47:06,296 --> 00:47:09,508
For nothing can be ill,
if she be well.

682
00:47:09,592 --> 00:47:12,428
How fares my lady?

683
00:47:19,104 --> 00:47:20,731
 

684
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,697
She's dead, my lord.

685
00:47:26,823 --> 00:47:28,700
She's dead.

686
00:47:28,825 --> 00:47:31,703
Her body sleeps
in capel's monument.

687
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:35,708
I saw her laid low
in her kindred's vault.

688
00:47:46,306 --> 00:47:50,227
Then, I defy you, stars!

689
00:49:14,335 --> 00:49:15,336
Live...

690
00:49:16,963 --> 00:49:20,133
and be prosperous.

691
00:49:20,259 --> 00:49:22,637
Farewell, good fellow.

692
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:32,685
Juliet.

693
00:51:22,874 --> 00:51:24,375
O my love...

694
00:51:29,382 --> 00:51:30,800
My wife.

695
00:51:33,387 --> 00:51:37,266
Death that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath,

696
00:51:37,393 --> 00:51:40,480
hath had no power yet
upon thy beauty.

697
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:47,280
Thou art not conquered...

698
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:55,290
Beauty's ensign yet
is crimson in thy lips

699
00:51:55,374 --> 00:51:57,793
and in thy cheeks.

700
00:51:59,588 --> 00:52:02,800
Death's pale flag
is not advanced there.

701
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:10,392
Tybalt.

702
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,696
Liest thou there
in thy bloody sheet?

703
00:52:30,085 --> 00:52:34,006
What more favor
can I do to thee,

704
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:38,512
than with that hand
that cut thy youth in twain

705
00:52:38,596 --> 00:52:44,311
to sunder his
that was thine enemy?

706
00:52:51,112 --> 00:52:52,989
Forgive me, cousin.

707
00:53:03,628 --> 00:53:06,214
Ah, dear Juliet.

708
00:53:11,096 --> 00:53:13,724
Why art thou yet so fair?

709
00:53:16,102 --> 00:53:19,022
Shall I believe that
unsubstantial death is amorous,

710
00:53:19,022 --> 00:53:21,525
and that the lean
abhorred monster

711
00:53:21,525 --> 00:53:24,820
keeps thee here in dark
to be his paramour?

712
00:53:24,821 --> 00:53:31,537
For fear of that,
I still will stay with thee.

713
00:53:35,627 --> 00:53:41,509
Never from this palace
of dim night depart again.

714
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:49,018
Here, here will I remain,

715
00:53:49,144 --> 00:53:54,525
with worms that are
thy chambermaids.

716
00:53:54,609 --> 00:53:56,319
 

717
00:54:12,132 --> 00:54:15,928
Eyes, look your last.

718
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:25,524
Arms, take your last embrace.

719
00:54:28,027 --> 00:54:33,033
And lips,
o you the doors of breath,

720
00:54:33,033 --> 00:54:35,035
seal with a righteous kiss

721
00:54:35,036 --> 00:54:37,831
a dateless bargain
to engrossing death.

722
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:18,633
Here's to my love.

723
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:49,171
Thus with a kiss...

724
00:55:50,841 --> 00:55:52,551
I die.

725
00:56:06,152 --> 00:56:07,570
Who's there?

726
00:56:07,654 --> 00:56:11,075
A friend, and one
that knows thee well.

727
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,079
Balthasar. How long
hast thou been here?

728
00:56:14,163 --> 00:56:15,581
Full half an hour.

729
00:56:15,665 --> 00:56:17,959
Go with me to the vault.

730
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:19,460
I dare not, sir.

731
00:56:19,586 --> 00:56:22,464
My master knows not
that I am gone hence.

732
00:56:22,548 --> 00:56:25,176
Stay then,
I'll go alone.

733
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:29,056
Fear comes upon me.

734
00:56:29,057 --> 00:56:32,352
O much I fear
some ill unlucky thing.

735
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:12,570
Romeo!

736
00:57:23,585 --> 00:57:25,504
Oh, what an unkind hour

737
00:57:25,587 --> 00:57:29,174
is guilty of this
lamentable chance?

738
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,107
  Ohh!

739
00:58:21,617 --> 00:58:26,915
O comfortable Friar,
where is my lord?

740
00:58:28,584 --> 00:58:31,504
I do remember well
where I should be,

741
00:58:31,588 --> 00:58:33,507
and there I am.

742
00:58:33,591 --> 00:58:35,510
Where is my Romeo?

743
00:58:35,593 --> 00:58:38,096
 

744
00:58:38,096 --> 00:58:40,098
I hear some noise.

745
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:42,602
Oh, where is my Romeo?

746
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:46,607
Oh, lady, come from this nest
of death, contagion,

747
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:48,108
and unnatural sleep.

748
00:58:50,112 --> 00:58:53,115
A greater power
than we can contradict

749
00:58:53,116 --> 00:58:54,617
hath thwarted
our intents.

750
00:58:54,617 --> 00:58:57,120
Come along.
The watch is coming.

751
00:58:57,121 --> 00:58:59,206
Where is my Romeo?

752
00:58:59,332 --> 00:59:01,125
 

753
00:59:05,632 --> 00:59:07,926
Come. Go, good Juliet.

754
00:59:09,219 --> 00:59:10,595
No.

755
00:59:10,721 --> 00:59:12,598
I dare no longer stay.

756
00:59:12,724 --> 00:59:14,100
No!

757
00:59:14,226 --> 00:59:17,021
I dare no longer stay.

758
00:59:17,021 --> 00:59:18,522
Juliet!

759
00:59:18,606 --> 00:59:20,525
 

760
00:59:20,609 --> 00:59:23,028
I dare no longer stay.

761
00:59:23,112 --> 00:59:25,531
I dare
no longer stay!

762
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:08,252
What's here?

763
01:00:13,635 --> 01:00:17,348
Poison, I see,
hath been his timeless end.

764
01:00:21,145 --> 01:00:23,022
O churl!

765
01:00:23,147 --> 01:00:26,025
Drunk all,
and left no friendly drop

766
01:00:26,151 --> 01:00:28,028
to help me after!

767
01:00:28,154 --> 01:00:30,031
I will kiss thy lips;

768
01:00:30,156 --> 01:00:33,034
haply some poison
yet doth hang on them

769
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:36,038
to make me die
with a restorative.

770
01:00:41,629 --> 01:00:44,048
Thy lips are warm!

771
01:00:55,146 --> 01:00:57,941
Oh, no, no!

772
01:01:08,664 --> 01:01:10,666
  Lead, boy, which way?

773
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:12,543
Search about
the churchyard.

774
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:14,171
Go, some of you...

775
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:15,672
Yea, noise?

776
01:01:20,137 --> 01:01:21,263
No!

777
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:31,150
Then I'll be brief,
o happy dagger!

778
01:01:32,778 --> 01:01:35,656
This is thy sheath;

779
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:39,161
there rest and let me die.

780
01:01:39,244 --> 01:01:41,163
 

781
01:01:59,145 --> 01:02:01,147
 

782
01:03:29,594 --> 01:03:31,972
Where be these enemies?

783
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,893
Capulet!

784
01:03:39,606 --> 01:03:40,982
Montague!

785
01:03:49,077 --> 01:03:53,082
See what a scourge
is laid upon your hate...

786
01:03:54,584 --> 01:03:59,715
that heaven finds means
to kill your joys with love;

787
01:03:59,799 --> 01:04:09,519
and l, for winking
at your discords too,

788
01:04:09,603 --> 01:04:14,192
have lost
a brace of kinsmen.

789
01:04:16,612 --> 01:04:19,323
All are punished.

790
01:04:24,622 --> 01:04:27,000
All are punished!

791
01:04:58,123 --> 01:05:03,129
A glooming peace
this morning with it brings.

792
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:08,637
The sun for sorrow
will not show his head,

793
01:05:08,637 --> 01:05:12,099
for never was a story
of more woe

794
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:17,314
than this of Juliet
and her Romeo.

795
