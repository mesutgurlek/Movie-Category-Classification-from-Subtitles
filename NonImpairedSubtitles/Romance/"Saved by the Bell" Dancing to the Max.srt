( music stops,

20
00:01:19,726 --> 00:01:22,889
No, no, no.
l just got a telegram.

21
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:29,795
All:
Ooh!

22
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:32,829
'''Dance Party'

23

( mimicking voice )
''Casey Kasem!''

27
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,884
- Let me see that.
- Cool, a dance contest!

28
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:50,355
How about you and l
enter in the contest?

29
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,381
We could win it all.

30
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:56,328
Win? With you?
Your feet need training wheels.

31
00:01:56,363 --> 00:01:59,389
Winning, losing?
Dancing is supposed to be fun.

32
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:02,197
Well, it will be fun--
if Kelly dances with me.

33
00:02:02,235 --> 00:02:05,966
Well, gee, guys, l'd love to be
partners with both of you.

34
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:08,839
Why don't you just go
with the best dancer?

35
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,866
Hit it.

36
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:12,902

38
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:34,433
Wow, Slater, that was hot.

39
00:02:34,468 --> 00:02:36,459
Are you kidding?

40
00:02:36,503 --> 00:02:39,961
l moved better last summer
when a bee flew in my shorts.

41
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:43,066
l'm waiting, ''Preppie.''
Let's see what you got.

42
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:47,478
Move back, give him room.
Hot feet coming through!

43
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,211
Slater, l could beat you now with
three toes tied behind my back.

44
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:59,157
You think <i>you're</i>
a better dancer than <i>me?</i>

45
00:02:59,192 --> 00:03:02,491
Go practice first,
then we'll have a real dance-off.

46
00:03:02,529 --> 00:03:06,295
Wow, a dancing duel.
How exciting!

47
00:03:10,303 --> 00:03:13,830
Hey Lisa, my horoscope says
we're destined to dance together.

48
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:17,435
My horoscope says,
''Beware of dorks.''

49
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:21,303
Well, l'll protect you
from them!

50
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,908
Hey Jessie, you want to be
my partner for the dance contest?

51
00:03:25,952 --> 00:03:28,546
Gee Danny, l'd love to.

52
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:32,389
Actually, no. l don't believe
in dance contests.

53
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:34,586
Then why don't we just
skip the contest and kiss all night?

54
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:37,893
Bye, Danny.

55
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:41,524
Hmm...

56
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:44,264
skip the date and start
with a goodnight kiss?

57
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:47,102
That Danny has good ideas.

58
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:51,133
Jessie:
This cannot be right.

59
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:54,578
Tell me something is wrong with
this scale before l hyperventilate.

60
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:58,710
The only thing wrong with that scale
is the flake who's on it.

61
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:03,155
l have grown an inch taller
since lunch. l feel like a giant.

62
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:05,384
You are not a giant.

63
00:04:05,425 --> 00:04:07,893
You're a bright, sensitive,
popular girl.

64
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:10,362
Everyone ''looks up''
to you.

65
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:12,627
Thanks a lot.

66
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,499
l mean, what's going to happen to me
if l keep growing?

67
00:04:15,535 --> 00:04:17,526
Stand tall. Be proud.

68
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:20,768
And practice your slam dunk.

69
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:24,140
Before l begin l have to make
a very sad announcement.

70
00:04:24,177 --> 00:04:27,305
Beethoven's alive?

71
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:31,443
Very amusing, Mr. Morris.
<i>*</i> Ha-ha ha-ha. <i>*</i>

72
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:35,683
No, unfortunately
l have to conduct

73
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:38,953
two music classes today,
simultaneously.

74
00:04:38,992 --> 00:04:42,655
Poor Mrs. Wickham slipped
and got her head stuck in a tuba.

75
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:46,462
Well maybe they should get
''Fat Tommy'' to blow her out.

76
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:48,490
Good suggestion.

77
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:50,628
All right, people, today,
we're going to play a piece

78
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,764
by Johann Sebastian Bach.

79
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:55,798
A piece?

80
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:57,833
Why can't we play
the whole thing?

81
00:04:57,877 --> 00:05:01,813
All right people, instruments up!
One bar for nothing.

82
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:05,409
One, and two, and three,
and...

83
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:08,182
( playing out of tune )

84
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:14,387
Oh! Thrilling!

85
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:18,223
Bach always gives me chills.

86
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:23,433
Keep playing my little
<i>wunderkind,</i>

87
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,065
l'll be right <i>Bach--</i>
l mean, back.

88
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,643
( playing
rock and roll style )

89
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:45,247
( playing out of tune )

90
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:49,421
Beautiful, beautiful!
l'm getting chills.

91
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:52,056
Are you feeling
what l'm feeling?

92
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:55,295
Yes sir, it was
the fish sticks at lunch.

93
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:57,667
You are what you eat,
Powers.

94
00:05:57,704 --> 00:06:00,264
All right, let me hear
the horns!

95
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:03,571
( plays sour note )

96
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,135
No chewing gum in class,
Mr. Morris.

97
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:09,240
All right, piano!

98
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:12,012
( off-key )

99
00:06:14,988 --> 00:06:18,355
Elegantly played, Powers.
Let's hear strings and flute!

100
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:21,019
( strings out of tune )

101
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:23,120
You're moving me,
you're moving me.

102
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:27,095
( resuming rock style )

103
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:29,294
Slater:
All right, move it, Jessie!

104
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:31,462
Kelly:
Whoo! Shake it, girl!

105
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:41,843
Zack, why don't you show Kelly
what a great dancer you are?

106
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:44,111
Not now, Screech.

107
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,550
Go ahead, Zack,
l'm dying to see you dance.

108
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:49,783
Yeah, dazzle us,
Preppie.

109
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,218
( resuming
off-key playing )

110
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:57,889
Wonderful. This is why
l went into teaching.

111
00:06:57,931 --> 00:07:00,900
Wonderful, wonderful.
Now a little faster tempo.

112
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:03,630
<i>Allegro con molto.</i>
<i>Poco, poco.</i> Yes.

113
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,400
<i>Nice. A little ''brighter. ''</i>
<i>Yes, nice.</i>

114
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,999
There you are.
Lovely.

115
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:11,033
( playing fast )

116
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:14,513
Huh? Wait a minute.
People, it's a little too...

117
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:18,142
Cut it back.
That's a little too bright, people.

118
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:21,017
- Where are you taking me?
- ( playing faster )

119
00:07:22,055 --> 00:07:24,785
Slow down, people!
lt's too fast!

120
00:07:24,824 --> 00:07:27,588
People, please!

121
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:30,323
Surcease!

122
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:32,524
( music stops abruptly )

123
00:07:32,565 --> 00:07:35,591
Jessie, l'm in big trouble.

124
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:39,196
What'd you do? Try to sell
your parents' house again?

125
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:42,231
l can't dance.
l've been faking it for years.

126
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:44,835
lf you can't dance,
why'd you challenge Slater?

127
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:47,745
lf Kelly and Slater enter
that contest, they're going to win.

128
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:50,477
That means their names
are going to be on the trophy.

129
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:53,782
Together... touching.

130
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,948
- So?
- So, l've got to stop them.

131
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,823
l can't allow them
to ''name-neck.''

132
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:01,850
Ugh.

133
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:04,728
Jessie, you're a terrific dancer.
Come on, you've got to help me.

134
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:07,028
Sure l'll help.
Let's see a few of your best moves.

135
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:09,591
Come on.

136
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:13,833
( snaps fingers
off-rhythm )

137
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:19,034
So, what do you think?

138
00:08:19,078 --> 00:08:22,070
l think you should go
with Screech.

139
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,480
<i>- ( knocking )</i>
- Come in.

140
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:34,983
Mr. Belding?
My name's Casey Kasem.

141
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:42,933
l'm here to talk about
the dance party at The Max.

142
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,132
''Details coming up,
right after l return.''

143
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:51,099
Just kidding.

144
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:53,977
Casey Kasem!
Wow.

145
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:56,140
l heard
about the dance party.

146
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:58,173
ls there anything
l can do to help?

147
00:08:58,218 --> 00:09:00,379
l'm the ''Big Bopper''
around here.

148
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,650
Well actually,
there is one thing.

149
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:05,021
Well, sit down
and lay it upon me, ''Big 'C.'''

150
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:10,356
At ''Dance Party'' we try to get
the support of the local schools.

151
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:13,593
Say no more. You want me
to help you host the event.

152
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:16,761
That hadn't occurred to me.

153
00:09:16,803 --> 00:09:18,794
l know.

154
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:23,775
You heard about me winning
the 1963 ''Chubby Checker Twist-Off.''

155
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,903
Here's a little taste.

156
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:30,177
<i>*</i> Let's twist again,
like we did last summer <i>*</i>

157
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:33,879
<i>*</i> Yeah, let's twist again,
like we did last year. <i>*</i>

158
00:09:38,324 --> 00:09:41,088
You want me to recreate
that moment, right?

159
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:45,393
Well actually, l was hoping
l could borrow a school banner.

160
00:09:45,431 --> 00:09:48,423
A banner?
That's all?

161
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:51,130
That's all, ''Bopper.''

162
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,435
Well okay, l'll present it
to you on the show.

163
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:56,465
Gee, that'd be great.
But l can take it right now.

164
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:59,342
( snaps )
l don't have one right now.

165
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,370
l'll bring it to you.

166
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,714
Oh, Zack, when are you
going to have the dance-off?

167
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:07,845
l need to know
who my partner is.

168
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:10,617
Well, Slater will be humiliated
the day after tomorrow.

169
00:10:10,657 --> 00:10:12,989
Are you really
that much better than him?

170
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:16,154
Every summer while the other kids
were playing baseball,

171
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:18,186
l was at dance camp.

172
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:20,756
Wow, l can't wait.

173
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:26,334
Why did l say that?

174
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:35,574
Zack:
Whatever you're doing, don't.

175
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,747
My darling, be my partner,
and this could be you.

176
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:52,230
So what do you say?
Pick you up, seven-ish?

177
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:55,234
Forget it, Screech.
She's already going with me.

178
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:57,259
Lisa, is that true?

179
00:10:57,303 --> 00:11:01,069
Sorry Screech, he asked me
this morning. Come on.

180
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:06,240
lt's all your fault.
l told you to let me lead.

181
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:12,444
<i>( dance music plays )</i>

182
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:15,943
- Whoo! You're doing great.
- l am?

183
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:18,685
Hey, l am, aren't l?

184
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:21,626
Okay now, here's a new step
l just invented.

185
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:28,100
- Awesome.
- Come on. Do it with me.

186
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:30,432
Slater's going to freak out
when he sees this.

187
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,461
Whoo!

188
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:40,302
Let's take five.

189
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:43,110
Yeah, let's cool down.
You're new at this.

190
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:45,014
( music stops )

191
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:50,716
Thanks.

192
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:52,850
You're a terrific dancer.

193
00:11:52,892 --> 00:11:55,622
Yeah, well, l went to dance camp
when l was a kid.

194
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:58,152
They actually have those?

195
00:11:58,197 --> 00:12:01,792
l can't believe
you're not entering the contest.

196
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:03,699
No big deal.

197
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:05,636
You're not into some
strange religion, are you?

198
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:08,606
- No.
- Then what's the problem?

199
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:11,906
Zack, l don't want
to talk about it, okay?

200
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:17,806
- Would you like to dance with me?
- l can't. l'm bigger than you.

201
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,318
And l'm still growing
at this very moment.

202
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,453
Too bad. Maybe l should have asked
10 minutes ago.

203
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:31,420
Hey Jessie, let's dance.

204
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:38,233
l'm too big for you.
l'm too big for everyone.

205
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:45,138
- Jessie, is that you up there?
- Yes, it's me.

206
00:12:45,178 --> 00:12:47,646
You don't want
to dance with me, do you?

207
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,513
l can't.
Everybody will laugh at us.

208
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:56,088
Zack, l do have a problem--
l'm too tall.

209
00:12:56,122 --> 00:12:58,420
Well, l haven't noticed
anyone measuring you lately.

210
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,018
That's because
they can't reach me.

211
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,826
Zack, you don't know
what it's like to be ''the freak''--

212
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:08,265
taller than all the boys--
the jokes, the looks, the whispers.

213
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:12,863
- Stop looking up at me!
- Look at the bright side.

214
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:15,567
At least you're the first one
to know when it rains.

215
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:16,632
Zack!

216
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:19,543
l'm sorry. Come on, there's
lots of guys taller than you.

217
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:21,638
Name one.

218
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:24,548
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?

219
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:39,626
Come on, Screech, cheer up.
lt can't be that bad.

220
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:44,125
lt's no use trying
to look stud-like anymore.

221
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,662
l think this time it's really over
between me and Lisa.

222
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:49,698
Look, you can't give up.

223
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:54,236
l heard if Byron hadn't asked Lisa
first, she'd have gone with you.

224
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,840
l know.
l started that rumor.

225
00:13:58,117 --> 00:14:00,711
Well then maybe you should
start looking for someone else.

226
00:14:00,753 --> 00:14:03,847
l can't. l've been crazy about her
since kindergarten,

227
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,859
when l glued my face
to the back of her sweater.

228
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:09,657
So you've been ''stuck on her''
a long time, huh?

229
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:13,654
But what's the use?
The story never changes.

230
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:16,497
There's the beautiful princess,
the dashing frog,

231
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:20,063
and the wart he left behind.

232
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:23,598
Come on, Screech, l think
you're being too hard on yourself.

233
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:33,718
- <i>( knocking )</i>
- Who is it?

234
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:38,815
- Can l come in?
- Zack?

235
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:42,191
This is the first time in 11 years
you've come through the door.

236
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:44,423
Well, there's a special reason.

237
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:46,658
Here.
These are for you.

238
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:48,826
Oh, they're beautiful.

239
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:51,029
We have the same kind
growing in our yard.

240
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:54,598
Not anymore.

241
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:58,133
Well, this is just to say thanks
for helping me.

242
00:14:58,177 --> 00:15:01,112
We're not finished yet.
We still have one more lesson.

243
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:06,515
- ( music plays )
- Pretend l'm Kelly.

244
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:09,578
''Oh Zack. Help me choose
between you and Slater.''

245
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,691
Voilà!

246
00:15:49,762 --> 00:15:51,957
Lisa, what happened
to you?

247
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:54,091
l kicked the TV
and sprained my ankle.

248
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:55,691
Why?

249
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:59,227
Watching the new Revlon commercial--
they discontinued my nail polish.

250
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:01,638
That was a dumb thing
to do.

251
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:04,871
Where were you ''Miss Pretty Pants,''
when l needed that advice?

252
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,777
Lisa, this is terrible.
l feel awful.

253
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:09,781
Don't worry about it, Byron.
l'll be okay.

254
00:16:09,815 --> 00:16:11,840
Yeah, but can you dance
on that ankle?

255
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:13,943
Well, the doctor said
there's a chance.

256
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:16,318
''A chance''?

257
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:19,847
Well, l can't take that chance.
l really want to win this contest.

258
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:22,053
Byron, what are you saying?

259
00:16:22,094 --> 00:16:24,494
l'm going to have to go
with my back-up, Didi Garrison.

260
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:28,864
How could you do that
to me?

261
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:31,199
Hey, let's ''pants'' him.

262
00:16:31,237 --> 00:16:34,729
Better start running now, punk, or
there's going to be a ''full moon.''

263
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:37,402
Yeah, and don't show your face
around here again!

264
00:16:37,443 --> 00:16:41,106
Hold me back, Slater! Hold me back!
No one hurts my woman!

265
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:46,308
He's a fool, Lisa.
You're hot no matter what.

266
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:48,820
You're strange,
but thanks, Screech.

267
00:16:48,854 --> 00:16:51,948
lf you like strange,
l'm your man.

268
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:57,123
- Well guys, it's the big moment.
- What?

269
00:16:57,163 --> 00:17:00,792
Zack, dance for me and help me
choose between you and Slater.

270
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:11,307
Kelly, do yourself a favor,
go with Slater.

271
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:14,541
- Zack, what are you saying?
- Yeah, what are you up to, Preppie?

272
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,640
Well, nothing.
l've decided to go with Jessie.

273
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:19,674
Jessie?

274
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:22,483
lf that's what you
really want, Zack.

275
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,512
Come on, Slater.
Let's go practice.

276
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:30,094
- Will you go with me?
- l'd love to be your partner.

277
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:34,558
Didn't your mother
ever tell you not to slouch?

278
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,591
You're much prettier
when you stand up straight.

279
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:39,627
- Thanks.
- Oh, and one other thing--

280
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:43,335
don't forget your high heels.
You might need them.

281
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:47,068
Can l have
your attention, please?

282
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:49,104
<i>( music stops )</i>

283
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:53,346
lt's now my pleasure to introduce
the star of ''Dance Party.''

284
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:56,412
Let's give him
a-- ''big hand.''

285
00:17:56,455 --> 00:17:59,322
The golden voice
from the Golden State...

( applause )

288
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:06,793
Max, thank you.
And thank you for letting us

289
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:09,027
use this great hangout
for our dance contest this week.

290
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:12,265
- Now, is everybody ready?
- ( cheers, applause )

291
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:16,873
You know, through the years,
l've been to a lot of schools.

292
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:19,878
l've met a lot of principals,
but l have never met a principal

293
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:23,541
who is so caring, so involved,
and so <i>hip,</i>

294
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:27,040
as your own
''Big Bopper'' Belding.

295
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:28,713
( cheers, applause )

296
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:30,745
Thank you, ''Caseman.''

297
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:34,317
- Now can l have the banner?
- Of course.

298
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,660
One minute, everybody.
Stand by and enjoy yourselves.

299
00:18:38,697 --> 00:18:42,724
- l could twist <i>and</i> sing.
- Let go of the microphone.

300
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:46,705
And now,
the big moment--

301
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:48,730
the announcement
of our three finalists

302
00:18:48,774 --> 00:18:51,265
who will all dance for you
one more time,

303
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,437
and then we'll pick the big winner
with your applause.

304
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:57,916
- Ready with the applause meter?
- Ready, Casey.

305
