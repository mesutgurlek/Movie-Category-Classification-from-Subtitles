Your son is arrived from London.

John. John.

You will see in my will

6
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:29,255
the estate of Norland
was left to me in such a way

7
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:33,968
as prevents me from dividing it
between my two families.

Calm yourself, Father,
this cannot be good for you.

Norland, in its entirety,

10

is therefore yours by law.

And I am happy for you and Fanny.

12
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:56,032
But your stepmother,
my wife and daughters,

13

You must help them.

Of course.
You must promise to do this.

I promise, Father.

FANNY:
Help them? What do you mean?

20

I mean to give them 3000 pounds.

21

The interest will provide them
with a little extra income.

22

The gift will fulfil my promise.

23
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,575
Without question. More than amply.

24
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,035
One had rather, on such occasions,

What brother would be so kind to his

They can hardly expect more.

The question is, what can you afford?

32
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,484
JOHN: A hundred pounds a year
to their mother, while she lives,

33
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:17,780
is better than losing 1500 at once.

34

Should she live longer than 15 years
we'd be completely taken in.

Twenty pounds now and then

you're quite right.
Indeed.

Although to say the truth, I'm convinced that
your father had no idea of giving them money.

They will have 500 a year.
What more could they want for?

40
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,769
Their housekeeping will be
nothing at all.

41
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:53,107
They'll have no carriage, no horses, hardly
any servants, and will keep no company.

Conceive how comfortable they will be!

such wit, if infirmity does not protect him?

Infirmity?
If Brandon is infirm,

"A slight ache" was his phrase.

I am by no means assured of that.

And had he such a preference,

It is. Stop complaining.

Your business won't detain you for long, I hope?

You are kind, but I have no idea of
returning immediately to Devonshire.

That is unlikely.

Perhaps Lady Allen disapproves
of his regard for Marianne.

819
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,703
And has invented an excuse
to send him away.

Then why did he not say so?

821
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:16,625
It's not like him to be secretive.

You think he's been acting a part?

825
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,053
No. He loves her. I am sure.

Of course!

827
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:34,977
Has he left her any assurance
of his return?

Cannot you ask if he proposed.

829

No! I cannot force a confidence
from Marianne. Nor should you.

We must trust her to confide in us

There was something underhand
in his manner.

You are resolved
to think the worst of him.

I'm not resolved.

I prefer give him the benefit of my
good opinion. He deserves no less.

The sad outcome of my connection
with a young woman named Eliza.

1159
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:22,166
What is not commonly known

1160
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:28,380
is that 20 years ago, before she died,
Eliza bore an illegitimate child.

1161
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:32,343
The father, whoever he was,
abandoned them.

1162
01:30:33,637 --> 01:30:39,767
As Eliza lay dying, she begged me
to look after the child.

1163
01:30:40,227 --> 01:30:44,855
I had failed her in every other way,
I could not refuse her now.

1164
01:30:45,565 --> 01:30:50,778
I placed the child, Beth,
with a family in the country,

1165
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:55,574
where I knew she would be looked
after. I saw her whenever I could.

01:30:56,493 --> 01:30:59,995
She grew up so headstrong,

1167
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:05,543
and, God forgive me,
I allowed her too much freedom.

Almost a year ago she disappeared.

He left without any explanation.

Lady Allen had annulled his legacy.
He was left with next to nothing.

He risked losing the estate, and the
money that remained, to his debtors.
