1
00:00:00,458 --> 00:00:04,224
OK, the sales after Thanksgiving
this year are going to be insane.

2
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:06,593
We're talking full-on shopping orgy.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,894
We are gonna save so much money
by spending money.

4
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:12,630
Yes, we are. Now, the key
to a successful Black Friday

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,160
is this scouting trip

6
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:17,834
where we locate, justify and hide, OK?

7
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:20,708
Locate: This is a very cute T-shirt.

8
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:23,773
Justify: I would wear this because...

9
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:28,241
- You could wear it to buy other things.
- It would be perfect for that.

10
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:30,219
Plus, it's got that really cool
gun design.

11
00:00:30,254 --> 00:00:32,449
- That's Africa, Laurie.
- So dumb.

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,584
Finally, we hide it so no one else
buys it before the sale starts.

13
00:00:35,626 --> 00:00:36,650
I'm on it!

14
00:00:37,628 --> 00:00:40,096
So who's coming to Thanksgiving
this year?

15
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:43,396
It's my first one post-divorce,
so I kinda wanna keep it small.

16
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:46,096
- Travis, you and Andy.
- But I love big Thanksgivings.

17
00:00:46,137 --> 00:00:48,662
You fill up your house
with family members you don't like,

18
00:00:48,706 --> 00:00:52,073
pump them full of cheap wine
and you watch their lives fall apart.

19
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:54,339
Bobby and I decided to separate
last Thanksgiving.

20
00:00:54,378 --> 00:00:55,868
I remember.

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,971
- Where did you hide it?
- In your car.

22
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:02,508
Laurie, shoplifting is not part
of Locate, Justify, Hide.

23
00:01:02,553 --> 00:01:06,216
You shop differently than I do.
Do you want me to go get it?

24
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:10,883
I already mailed them a
check, which they will receive on Friday

25
00:01:10,928 --> 00:01:13,192
when this shirt is half-price,
so this isn't stealing.

26
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,788
Whatever you need to tell yourself.

27
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:18,859
- Jules, I can come to Thanksgiving.
- Oh, joy.

28
00:01:18,903 --> 00:01:22,202
Dale had invited me to his foster mom's
apartment, but I'm not gonna go.

29
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,470
Mostly because her apartment
is more like a rehab center.

30
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:27,443
- Quick question...
- Dale can't come.

31
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:29,969
- Even just to...
- Poke his head in and say "hi."

32
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:32,141
- But he shaved his rat-tail.
- Yeah, no.

33
00:01:32,183 --> 00:01:33,878
- He bought real pants.
- Still no.

34
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:38,554
So you're having the whole gang
over for Turkey Day, huh?

35
00:01:38,589 --> 00:01:40,250
- Well...
- I don't really have any plans,

36
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:43,590
seeing as my wife left and all our
friends were pretty much her friends.

37
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:46,328
Plus, my parents are dead.

38
00:01:46,363 --> 00:01:49,230
- Did they die in the last six months?
- No.

39
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:51,166
Then who cares?
Hand me my drink.

40
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:54,928
You don't have to fish for an invite,
I'd love for you to come.

41
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:56,599
I guess I could probably come.

44
00:02:01,812 --> 00:02:05,111
- Yeah, I'll never do that.
- Yes, he will.

45
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:07,014
I know, I can't wait.

46
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:09,615
So, there was a huge line for the can,

47
00:02:09,653 --> 00:02:13,180
I had to use the men's room and I met
a guy. Can he come to Thanksgiving?

48
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:16,088
She said no, Steve!

49
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,589
Could've been the one.

50
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,625
Hey, J-Bird. Now you think you can
make a real stuffing this year?

51
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:25,294
This instant stuff's bush league.

52
00:02:25,336 --> 00:02:27,167
You can't just assume
that you're invited.

53
00:02:27,204 --> 00:02:29,934
You want me to eat alone on my boat
like an old Japanese man?

54
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:33,500
I just... I wanted
a small Thanksgiving this year.

55
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:35,307
- No, you don't.
- All right, fine.

56
00:02:35,346 --> 00:02:38,281
I was pretending to want a small one so
that when I buckled and had a big one,

57
00:02:38,315 --> 00:02:40,715
I'd be known as the hero
who saved Thanksgiving.

58
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:44,187
- You think so much your head must hurt.
- It does, it really does.

59
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:45,711
Not me.

60
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:47,314
Always free and breezy
up here, baby.

61
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:49,383
Hey! Can Kylie come by tomorrow?

62
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:51,519
Her family doesn't really do
Thanksgiving.

63
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:53,587
- Aw, broken home?
- Filter, Mom.

64
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:56,759
- Of course Kylie can come!
- Not your call, Bobby.

65
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,826
Of course you can come. But just know,
you're gonna sit next to me

66
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,236
and we're gonna break down
your family a little bit.

67
00:03:02,273 --> 00:03:04,298
Bring it, Mrs. Cobb.

68
00:03:04,341 --> 00:03:07,174
- I like this one.
- Thanks again.

69
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:10,078
- Very welcome, Kylie!
- Again, not for you to say.

70
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:14,050
You know, those two are pretty tight.
You had the doink talk with Trav, right?

71
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:15,813
Honey, I got pregnant way too young.

72
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:17,582
I've been having the doink talk
with Travis

73
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:19,816
every three months
since he was nine.

74
00:03:19,857 --> 00:03:22,382
I used to teach him
by using little stuffed animals.

75
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:24,053
I'd tape tiny private parts on them.

76
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:26,688
That bit me in the ass, though,
on show-and-tell day.

77
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,290
Yeah, Trav and I had
the father-son talk when he was 16.

78
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:33,335
We actually didn't talk, you know,
but I showed him how to move his hips.

79
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,271
Normally I'd be mad,
but Travis really needs the help.

80
00:03:36,307 --> 00:03:38,070
- Have you ever seen him dance?
- Hm-hm.

81
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:39,905
It's like he is dodging bullets, with...

82
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,039
Do you remember
that great Thanksgiving blow-up

83
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:48,210
when your Uncle Bud got drunk
and told your cousin she was adopted?

84
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:51,187
She was 14 and Korean, Ellie.
On some level she knew.

85
00:03:51,455 --> 00:03:54,117
Oh, hi, Grayson.
Do you wanna ask me something?

86
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:56,254
Yeah, you wanna ask her something?

87
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:58,591
- I can't do this.
- Come on, G-String.

88
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:01,029
Think of how much fun
we're gonna have. Drinking beer...

89
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:02,555
Wine, when all the beer runs out.

90
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,627
Come on, Grayson. You must be great at
saying things you don't mean to women,

91
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,935
like, "I'll call you" or
"I've never done this before either."

92
00:04:09,974 --> 00:04:13,637
Fine! May I come over
for Thanksgiving?

93
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:16,239
You know, I'm gonna
answer you like this...

94
00:04:20,117 --> 00:04:23,211
Come on, it's
like trying to break a horse!

95
00:04:23,254 --> 00:04:26,280
She won't let go
until you just relax into it, man.

96
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:28,791
Yeah...

97
00:04:28,826 --> 00:04:31,659
OK, we're done.

98
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:43,102
A-Team, what's with the burger?
Turkey time's in like three hours.

99
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,337
Thanksgiving is a food marathon.
You have to warm up.

100
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:49,107
This is like stretching.

101
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,639
- Want a bite?
- No can do-sie.

102
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:54,617
Just got my cholesterol results
and I'm rocking three bills.

103
00:04:54,652 --> 00:04:56,745
Still cooking everything
in that travel fryer?

104
00:04:57,121 --> 00:04:59,351
- GAC.
- That's not healthy.

105
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:03,723
Hm...

106
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,252
All right, hey, listen.
Don't tell Jules, all right?

107
00:05:06,297 --> 00:05:08,595
She'll get all worried and care-takey.

108
00:05:08,632 --> 00:05:11,123
That info is locked up.

109
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:13,796
All right, now hide that key
where I'll never find it.

110
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:18,807
I don't have to. I trust you that much.

111
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:20,104
Wow.

112
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:28,008
What you got in your hand there,
champ?

113
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:31,952
It's a... tiny pretend key.

114
00:05:33,524 --> 00:05:36,459
- OK...
- Excuse me. Quick announcement:

115
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,523
I'm about to bring Kylie in,

116
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:42,828
so I need you all to act
like normal human beings.

117
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:44,493
Boo!

118
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:46,230
I know, it's gonna be hard.
But I can help.

119
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,568
Mrs. Torres, Kylie doesn't have
an eating disorder.

120
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:50,698
She runs cross-country,
think of a new question.

121
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:53,733
Mr. Torres, I don't care how much
you eat, let's keep our pants buttoned.

122
00:05:53,777 --> 00:05:56,143
Laurie, your breasts are bigger
than hers. There, I said it.

123
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,511
You don't need to tell her.

124
00:05:57,548 --> 00:05:59,175
Neighbor guy,
you brought your fruity guitar.

125
00:05:59,216 --> 00:06:03,619
Let's keep that holstered. Mom,
you have multiple problem areas,

126
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,555
so when in doubt, just say to yourself,
"That's a bad idea."

127
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,286
And, Dad, we both know
it's best you don't say anything.

128
00:06:12,363 --> 00:06:15,161
- That was a little snarky.
- Yeah, he's just nervous.

129
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,759
It's the first time he's brought a girl
to a family thing.

130
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:20,827
So I think we all know
what we have to do.

131
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:22,702
The whole...

132
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:27,334
Hello? Mom?

133
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:29,073
♪ Hi, Kylie ♪

134
00:06:29,913 --> 00:06:31,403
♪  Hi, Kylie ♪

135
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:34,547
♪ Hi, Kylie ♪

136
00:06:34,585 --> 00:06:37,748
- Hi, Kylie.
- Mom...

137
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:39,949
No, no! There's a big finish.
Hey, come on...

138
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,756
♪ Hi, Kylie ♪

139
00:06:45,496 --> 00:06:46,520
Whoo!

140
00:06:46,563 --> 00:06:49,361
- Unbelievable.
- Oh, cool it, she's still here.

141
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,594
Aren't you, Kylie?

142
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:55,695
Cougar Town 1x09 - Here Comes My Girl

143
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,856
Kylie, awesome job surviving
the first wave of embarrassment.

144
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:07,261
I just gritted my teeth
and went somewhere else.

145
00:07:07,298 --> 00:07:10,028
- Atta girl.
- I'll grab you a soda.

146
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:13,093
For you ladies, I assume
two giant buckets of wine?

147
00:07:13,137 --> 00:07:15,867
- Red, please.
- Half red, half white.

148
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:18,699
What? It's really good.

149
00:07:19,743 --> 00:07:22,439
Now, that is a very cute top!

150
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,040
I mean, I clearly couldn't wear it,
because of these puppies, but...

151
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:27,609
OK.

152
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:29,016
Leave her alone.

153
00:07:29,053 --> 00:07:30,350
That's a nice necklace.

154
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:32,582
Are your parents rich?

155
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,924
- Here you go!
- Oh, thanks.

156
00:07:37,695 --> 00:07:41,324
That first sip. It burns
your throat just a little bit,

157
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:44,596
but then when it hits your head,
it's like, oh, yeah...

158
00:07:44,635 --> 00:07:46,535
Jules Cobb on drinking.

159
00:07:46,837 --> 00:07:49,738
So... Kylie seems sweet.

160
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:52,401
- She's pretty great.
- Yeah...

161
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:53,535
Are you having sex?

162
00:07:53,577 --> 00:07:56,410
Wow! Just diving right in.

163
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:59,814
Courage. Oh, come on, we're not
like other mother-son combos.

164
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,614
- We're friends.
- I know, but...

165
00:08:02,653 --> 00:08:04,416
Are you sure you want
to go down that road?

166
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:07,822
- I think it'll be fun.
- All right, well...

167
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,752
Yeah, I think Kylie...

168
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:14,559
Kylie could be the one.

169
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:16,122
Aw!

170
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,135
But I'm really nervous,
because I...

171
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:21,763
- You know, it's my...
- First time. Aw!

172
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:24,638
OK, do you mind if I put
the friend thing on hold for a second

173
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:27,439
- and get on that Mom train?
- I'll allow it.

174
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:30,641
Look, I know you're 18 and
you're gonna do what you wanna do.

175
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:34,173
But, oh, please remember that talk we
had about just being ready emotionally.

176
00:08:34,218 --> 00:08:35,879
And, oh, my God, protection.

177
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,648
Want me to show you how to put
a condom on again?

178
00:08:37,688 --> 00:08:39,849
- 'Cause we can get the rolling pin.
- I'm good.

179
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,688
Plus, the rolling pin made me
feel kind of bad about myself.

180
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:44,421
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, of course it did.

181
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:47,021
- Well, thanks for being so cool, Mom.
- No problem.

182
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:49,589
Hey, wait. You just called me cool.

183
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:53,194
- Do you mind if I tell everyone that?
- Go nuts. The guys are gone, though.

184
00:08:53,237 --> 00:08:56,468
It's their annual "let's pretend
we're not old" basketball game

185
00:08:56,507 --> 00:08:57,633
against the neighbors.

186
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,310
Whoo!

187
00:09:02,346 --> 00:09:04,439
Ooh!

188
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:12,279
Yes!

189
00:09:27,237 --> 00:09:29,205
Calm down. We're still up by three.

190
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:31,730
- Shut up, Lisa!
- Andy, come here, get over here.

191
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:34,573
Don't get sucked into her trash talk.
That's what she wants.

192
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,602
Now, if we bear down,
we can win this thing!

193
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:39,707
Yeah, I hope so. My guy's
shoes light up when he jumps.

194
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,378
All right, hands in!
Let's leave it all out there.

195
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:44,387
- I love you guys.
- One, two, three...

196
00:09:44,421 --> 00:09:45,911
- Win!
- Defense!

197
00:09:47,691 --> 00:09:48,783
Yes!

198
00:09:48,826 --> 00:09:49,918
And I'll say it.

199
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,929
I'm glad we won, but I'm even happier
Lisa sprained her ankle.

200
00:09:53,497 --> 00:09:54,930
Remember this day, Andy.

201
00:09:55,966 --> 00:09:58,799
I am gonna raise
this summer sausage to you.

202
00:09:58,836 --> 00:10:00,861
Nope! No more fatty foods for you.

203
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:03,896
You can't die yet, Travis needs you.
And I don't have a great black dress.

204
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:06,933
- You told her?
- Oh, calm down, gravy veins.

205
00:10:06,977 --> 00:10:09,241
- He told me, I told her.
- Why?

206
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,304
Because I want
to get this par-tay started.

207
00:10:11,348 --> 00:10:13,441
Come on, he betrayed you. Go.

208
00:10:13,484 --> 00:10:16,351
Sorry, man. When I try
to keep a secret from Ellie,

209
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:20,756
I get heartburn and just...
it hurts so bad.

210
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,224
Off the couch!

211
00:10:26,463 --> 00:10:28,328
God bless us, every one.

212
00:10:28,365 --> 00:10:30,356
I do not know how Andy does it.

213
00:10:30,401 --> 00:10:33,029
No offense, but I could not be
with someone like you.

214
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,436
Everyone in the world like me
thanks you.

215
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:38,566
I guess you'll have to stick
with those middle-aged golf biddies

216
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:41,373
who are willing to spring for tacos
in exchange for human touch.

217
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:43,937
- Hey, Ellie. Happy Thanksgiving.
- And you.

218
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:47,144
Enough with the 20-something
bimbos. It's pathetic.

219
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,185
What just happened?

220
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:55,049
OK, this turkey should be done
in about 17 more hours.

221
00:10:56,693 --> 00:11:00,151
So... you and Kylie
just chilling in the bedroom?

222
00:11:00,664 --> 00:11:02,598
- Don't get weird.
- I'm not being weird!

223
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:05,227
- You don't be weird.
- It's not gonna be tonight.

224
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:06,964
I know, silly.

225
00:11:07,004 --> 00:11:09,632
It's gonna be tomorrow
when her parents go away.

226
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:12,333
Oh.

227
00:11:14,144 --> 00:11:17,739
Tomorrow. My son's gonna be
making love, tomorrow.

228
00:11:17,781 --> 00:11:22,150
- Congratulations?
- I know when it's gonna be, and where.

229
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:25,747
And now that Bobby taught him his hip
thing, I even know the basic rhythm.

230
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:28,952
One and two, and one, two, three,
and one and two, and pause...

231
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:32,057
Dale is just, like, one, two,
three, four, five, bam!

232
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:35,622
- And then he farts.
- Later. But you know what?

233
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,829
Travis, you've had a million talks
with him. It's gonna be OK.

234
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:41,599
In one of our friend talks,
he told me she's not on the pill.

235
00:11:41,638 --> 00:11:43,833
Condoms break all the time.

236
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:46,001
Especially
if there's piercings involved.

237
00:11:46,043 --> 00:11:50,036
- Stop, I'm begging you.
- I'm gonna be a grandmother at 41!

238
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,015
- They're gonna put me on the news!
- Keep it together, sweetie.

239
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,041
Not gonna happen.

240
00:11:55,085 --> 00:11:58,350
What kind of mother lets her daughter
wear a slutty cardigan like that

241
00:11:58,388 --> 00:12:00,185
without putting her on the pill?

242
00:12:01,592 --> 00:12:02,889
Whore.

243
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:06,953
I'm not proud that sometimes
I hook up with women for food.

244
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:10,797
It's not my fault every 24-year-old
on Earth has a daddy complex

245
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:12,665
and thinks my name's exotic.

246
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:15,831
- Still, we both know it's not forever.
- Hell no.

247
00:12:15,873 --> 00:12:19,900
Someday I'm gonna find me a real
woman, someone who looks after me.

248
00:12:19,943 --> 00:12:22,411
Yeah! And someone
that helps get me out of my shell.

249
00:12:22,446 --> 00:12:25,779
- I don't want to end up alone.
- That would kill me.

250
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:30,719
Oh! Getting deep alert!

251
00:12:34,224 --> 00:12:37,250
- Permission to speak?
- Proceed.

252
00:12:37,294 --> 00:12:39,785
Do you think the woman
you're looking for is even out there?

253
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:44,828
- Yeah.
- Definitely.

254
00:12:47,504 --> 00:12:48,698
Oh, my chest.

255
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:56,204
Oh, good, you're on the bed.

256
00:12:56,713 --> 00:12:59,079
- Do you know what this is?
- Is it a water balloon?

257
00:12:59,116 --> 00:13:02,210
Close. It's a condom filled with water.

258
00:13:02,252 --> 00:13:04,243
That is not good news.

259
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:07,587
I mean, people think that condoms
are foolproof, but they're not.

260
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:09,421
These things can break.

261
00:13:18,368 --> 00:13:21,394
OK, they may not break right away,
but you know,

262
00:13:21,438 --> 00:13:23,531
once you get started,
this could happen.

263
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:26,399
Come on!

264
00:13:27,444 --> 00:13:31,107
All right, this isn't fair because this
is a balloon that I got at a toy store,

265
00:13:31,148 --> 00:13:33,241
'cause I thought it'd be weird
to use a real condom.

266
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:36,582
- You thought that would be weird?
- Why won't you break?

267
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,554
No one's gonna stomp on it, Mom.

268
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:40,447
Why is she doing this?

269
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,890
I'm sorry, Kylie, it's...
I had talked to Travis

270
00:13:42,926 --> 00:13:45,326
and I happen to know
tomorrow night's the big night.

271
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:46,420
Travis?

272
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:49,398
I was just rapping
with my boy there and...

273
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:51,128
Tell her I'm cool. I'm so cool...

274
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:53,329
I think I should just go home.

275
00:13:54,404 --> 00:13:55,564
Wow.

276
00:13:56,974 --> 00:13:58,669
I trusted you.

277
00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:05,714
Well...

278
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:08,475
Of course.

279
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:17,731
That was the worst sex talk ever.

280
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:20,305
I'm a horrible mom.

281
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:24,466
Make me feel better, Grayson.

282
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:28,639
I'm gonna go check on Stan.

283
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:32,376
Can you think of anything
more uncomfortable

284
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:35,047
than what I just put Travis through?

285
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:37,920
- Actually I could think of a...
- I can.

286
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,586
Let's go play some hoops.
You wanna go play some hoops?

287
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:43,790
Hoops. Man, that's my middle name,
is Hoops. I love hoops.

288
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:45,762
I feel terrible.

289
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:48,529
I mean, Travis was never great
with the ladies.

290
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:51,560
When he was 12
he met this girl at camp,

291
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:54,266
and he used to write her
all these love letters.

292
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:58,038
But the address she gave him
was to a dog toy factory in Wisconsin,

293
00:14:58,078 --> 00:14:59,841
so the letters kept getting returned.

294
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:02,211
I don't want his heart to break
so I started to write him back.

295
00:15:02,248 --> 00:15:04,808
I only had to break up with him
because he hit puberty

296
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:08,787
and started mailing me pictures
and asking me to do some weird stuff.

297
00:15:08,822 --> 00:15:12,155
This is gonna blow over and Travis
won't talk to you for a couple of days.

298
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:16,356
No. I'm the hero who saved
Thanksgiving. I have to fix this now.

299
00:15:16,396 --> 00:15:18,227
I just gotta get Kylie not to leave.

300
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:20,357
This is her purse.

301
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,198
She's not gonna leave
without her purse.

302
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:29,240
- What are you doing?
- Locate, Justify, Hide, Ellie.

303
00:15:29,776 --> 00:15:33,906
Locate: I got it.
Justify: I gotta do it.

304
00:15:33,947 --> 00:15:35,938
- Hide: I'm on it.
- [Laurie squeals]

305
00:15:38,385 --> 00:15:40,148
Why do we have
to hide the bag outside?

306
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:42,814
Because Travis has found
every present I ever hid for him,

307
00:15:42,856 --> 00:15:44,949
except for the ones
buried in this backyard.

308
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:47,926
Now, we gotta grab a shovel,
and remember where we put it.

309
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:51,124
There's still a Discman buried here
somewhere. Here you go.

310
00:15:51,164 --> 00:15:53,689
Are you really gonna bury my purse?

311
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,731
Why are your boyfriends acting so weird?

312
00:16:04,244 --> 00:16:08,578
First of all, only Bobby's my boyfriend.
And they're not acting weird.

313
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:17,754
You know
you're on the same team, right?

314
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,282
- Shut up, Lisa!
- Mind your own business, Lisa!

315
00:16:20,326 --> 00:16:22,226
- Foul!
- You're hiding something.

316
00:16:22,262 --> 00:16:26,824
Normally, I'd wait for that chest gas
to push it on out of you,

317
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:29,733
- but this seems too juicy.
- You can't make me tell.

318
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:34,331
Do you remember when we used
to have sex in inappropriate places?

319
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:37,334
Not in front of Stan. Wake up.

320
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:40,906
Like baby Rick's third birthday party,

321
00:16:40,947 --> 00:16:44,713
when you took me
against the bouncy house?

322
00:16:47,654 --> 00:16:49,554
- Get a hold of these.
- Oh.

323
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:50,647
Mom?

324
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:56,055
How's that feel, Mr. Torres?
Do you like that?

325
00:16:56,096 --> 00:16:58,929
- I do like it, I do. Oh.
- Yeah?

326
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:04,125
- But thanks for saving me.
- You will tell me!

327
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,162
It's weird that you won't give me
my purse back.

328
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:10,108
- Well, if I do, are you gonna leave?
- Yes.

329
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,407
Look, I just want to talk to you
for a second.

330
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:14,572
And I promise I'm not gonna
make you uncomfortable,

331
00:17:14,614 --> 00:17:17,777
because if I start to say anything
crazy, Laurie is gonna stop me.

332
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:20,308
Oh! Yes! I can just make a noise
or something.

333
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:21,513
Fine.

334
00:17:21,554 --> 00:17:25,251
Kylie, this is my fault.
I mean, Travis and I are so tight

335
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,419
the line between friend and mother
has always been a little blurry.

336
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:31,521
You know, up until a few years ago
he was taking naps in my bed...

337
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:33,759
Thank you.

338
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:36,835
Now, the point is,
is that Travis confided in me

339
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,428
and I took advantage of that.

340
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:40,769
I just wish
he hadn't told you everything.

341
00:17:40,807 --> 00:17:44,106
It's just awkward for him.
You know, he's still a virgin.

342
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:47,307
He told me he wasn't.

343
00:17:47,347 --> 00:17:49,315
Oh, God.
Why didn't you stop me?

344
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:51,681
I really thought
I had time to take a sip.

345
00:17:51,718 --> 00:17:53,117
Clearly not.

346
00:17:54,154 --> 00:17:56,315
All right, Kylie...

347
00:17:56,356 --> 00:17:58,017
If you go, I understand.

348
00:17:58,658 --> 00:18:02,492
But I hope you stay for Travis,
'cause he really cares about you.

349
00:18:04,097 --> 00:18:05,462
Come on, sweetie.

350
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:10,258
Please don't torture him
the way my mom tortures me.

351
00:18:10,937 --> 00:18:13,872
I gotta say, I am loving this
Thanksgiving drama

352
00:18:13,907 --> 00:18:16,273
- you two have going on.
- Glad I could help.

353
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:18,937
Would you stop with this
end-of-the-world nonsense?

354
00:18:18,978 --> 00:18:22,675
You and this girl are gonna bond
over how horrible your mom is,

355
00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:26,481
- you'll get in her pants within a week.
- You make it sound so beautiful.

356
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:29,215
Look, parenting
doesn't come naturally to me.

357
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:31,689
Luckily, Andy's a great dad.

358
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:33,555
He would've been a great woman.

359
00:18:33,593 --> 00:18:35,561
<i>He would've loved
breastfeeding.</i>

360
00:18:35,595 --> 00:18:37,722
I really would have. Hmm.

361
00:18:37,764 --> 00:18:39,857
I need you to cut your mom some slack.

362
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:42,766
I have a lot riding on this relationship
you have with her.

363
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:45,396
I'm basing my whole
parenting strategy around it.

364
00:18:45,438 --> 00:18:47,770
- Worst decision ever.
- Please.

365
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:50,241
And you know as well as I do
that in the end,

366
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:52,267
your mom always comes through for you.

367
00:18:52,912 --> 00:18:54,971
Hey, Trav?

368
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:57,448
- You wanna talk?
- Sure.

369
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:04,186
Got a little intense out there, huh?

370
00:19:04,224 --> 00:19:06,385
At one point, I straight
punched you in the face.

371
00:19:06,426 --> 00:19:07,859
Don't get blood on my frozen corn.

372
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:10,260
If anybody's still here,
we're eating that in 20 minutes.

373
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:12,594
This is dicey.
Should we just try to hash it out?

374
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:14,532
Probably. But then again, you know,

375
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:17,661
it feels like we'd be talking about
something way in the future,

376
00:19:17,704 --> 00:19:19,467
you know, like, years.

377
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:22,235
Who knows how we'll feel by then?
One of us may even be dead.

378
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:25,244
- Yeah, and with your cholesterol...
- Oh, yeah, it'll be me.

379
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:27,109
Look, I say we act like men,

380
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:29,944
and we bury it under
a mountain of denial so deep

381
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:32,577
no one can make us believe
that it ever actually happened.

382
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:34,985
Already done. Free and breezy.

383
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:36,352
Want a beer?

384
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:37,879
- I'll have two.
- Nice.

385
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:11,015
OK, quick disclaimer:

386
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:13,184
When we attack the food,
let's chew carefully

387
00:20:13,226 --> 00:20:16,252
because I'm missing an earring.
OK, grab a hand.

388
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,788
This is my favorite part
of Thanksgiving,

389
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:20,355
'cause I get to say
what I'm thankful for.

390
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,459
Do we have to hold hands
the whole time?

391
00:20:22,502 --> 00:20:26,734
Yes, you do. OK, for me,
it's really all about family.

392
00:20:26,773 --> 00:20:30,368
And I'm not talking about just blood,
because it's bigger than that.

393
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,937
Family is about all the people
that you choose to let into your life.

394
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,041
Family is about support
and working through things.

395
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:40,678
Even though you can care so much,

396
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,282
you can scream and fight
just as easily as you can make love...

397
00:20:45,325 --> 00:20:47,725
Yeah, good, good call.

398
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:52,458
Um, anyway, I'm just really thankful
that you're all a part of my life. I am.

399
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:53,726
I love you guys.

400
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:57,429
- Let's eat.
- Yay!

401
00:21:07,988 --> 00:21:12,687
- Are you gonna tell me yet?
- No. I can't.

402
00:21:12,726 --> 00:21:14,353
It's fine. I can wait.

403
00:21:14,394 --> 00:21:17,659
Oh, God, just release this pressure.

404
00:21:17,697 --> 00:21:20,257
Is it about Grayson or Bobby?

405
00:21:21,334 --> 00:21:23,302
Oh! Don't, don't, don't, don't...

406
00:21:24,337 --> 00:21:26,396
You'll break eventually.

407
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:28,907
Oh, just let me die!

408
00:21:31,311 --> 00:21:32,710
Oh!

409
00:21:32,746 --> 00:21:35,510
Oh, you're a cruel woman!

410
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:38,248
But I love you, dear.
