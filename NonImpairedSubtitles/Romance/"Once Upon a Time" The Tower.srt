his name was Walsh.

for some job in Maine.

She wouldn't take a job in Queens

if she said yes.

At least we know we're in

Killian: You know something, Swan?

Whenever you're around,
I inevitably find myself

479
00:26:08,932 --> 00:26:11,504
trekking through some manner
of woods or forest,

480
00:26:11,606 --> 00:26:13,291
courting danger.

481
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:15,153
Ah. Here, I thought you

one swashbuckling tale after another...

You really think they'll forgive me.

655
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,313
You're their child.

656
00:38:11,006 --> 00:38:13,403
Of course they'll forgive you.

657
00:38:13,713 --> 00:38:16,898
[ Crowd gasping, murmuring ]

658
00:38:20,451 --> 00:38:24,179
Mother? Father?

659
00:38:27,183 --> 00:38:29,136
[ Crying ] - My dear.
- Oh, my daughter.

660
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:31,120
[ Crying ]

661
00:38:33,817 --> 00:38:36,943
Are you going to tell me why you
were out in the woods all night?

662
00:38:37,026 --> 00:38:38,879
I was there because...

663
00:38:40,984 --> 00:38:42,692
...I was afraid.

664
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:46,212
Afraid?

665
00:38:51,238 --> 00:38:53,624
- 'Cause we lost Emma.
- Twice.

666
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:56,979
Once as a baby,
then again when we were...

667
00:38:57,116 --> 00:38:59,604
forced to return to the
Enchanted Forest without her.

668
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:01,776
- No, neither time was our fault.
- I know.

669
00:39:02,697 --> 00:39:06,002
But because we lost her,
I was never her father.

670
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:09,341
You have been a great father.

671
00:39:09,424 --> 00:39:12,978
To her now. But I didn't raise her.

672
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:14,746
[ Sighs ]

673
00:39:14,829 --> 00:39:17,682
And this child, this one...

674
00:39:17,827 --> 00:39:18,940
[ Sighs ]

675
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:20,453
I don't know.

676
00:39:20,536 --> 00:39:23,244
I've never done this before,
and I don't know if I can.

677
00:39:24,205 --> 00:39:25,596
You don't have to.

678
00:39:26,877 --> 00:39:29,549
We're going to do this
the way we do everything...

679
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:31,334
together.

680
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,779
[ Exhales softly ]

681
00:39:33,934 --> 00:39:35,835
Now, how did I forget that?

682
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,486
Now, come on.
We have a nursery to build.

683
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,650
Any particular reason she would
send a demon who looks like you?

684
00:39:52,733 --> 00:39:53,851
No idea. It was just there,

685
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:56,783
wearing my face,
harping on my deepest fears.

686
00:39:56,971 --> 00:39:59,123
It knew your deepest fears?

687
00:39:59,206 --> 00:40:01,908
Yeah... things I never
told anyone, even Mary Margaret.

688
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:05,252
It wasn't until I admitted them
that I was able to defeat it

689
00:40:05,401 --> 00:40:06,963
by stabbing it
with the hilt of my sword.

690
00:40:07,112 --> 00:40:08,998
W... where is it... your sword?

691
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:10,838
That's the strange part.

692
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,970
After I killed it, the hilt...
it... disappeared.

693
00:40:14,053 --> 00:40:16,166
Well, what's that mean, then?

694
00:40:16,312 --> 00:40:19,236
When we face our deepest fears,
our true courage comes out.

695
00:40:19,815 --> 00:40:23,057
When you used the hilt of your
sword to vanquish your fears,

696
00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:25,646
your courage transferred into it.

697
00:40:25,785 --> 00:40:27,270
Then why'd it disappear?

698
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:30,455
It didn't disappear. She took it.

699
00:40:30,586 --> 00:40:33,506
Hang on. The Wicked Witch
stole his courage?

700
00:40:33,613 --> 00:40:35,588
Well, a symbol of it, at least.

701
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:38,354
And symbols can be powerful totems.

702
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,638
I'm so glad you came by.

703
00:40:48,843 --> 00:40:52,078
Of course.
I so loved getting to know you.

704
00:40:52,187 --> 00:40:55,289
And please thank David again
for meeting with me.

705
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:57,593
You know, I'd heard so many stories

706
00:40:57,685 --> 00:40:59,742
about your courageous prince. I just...

707
00:41:00,382 --> 00:41:02,468
I just feel so lucky
to have met you both.

708
00:41:02,554 --> 00:41:03,906
Oh, we're the lucky ones.

709
00:41:04,169 --> 00:41:06,609
With this curse, I had no time
to prepare for the baby,

710
00:41:06,713 --> 00:41:09,773
and suddenly I feel like...
I can stop panicking.

711
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,578
[ Sighs ]
Of course you can.

712
00:41:11,676 --> 00:41:13,762
There's no reason to be scared.

713
00:41:14,031 --> 00:41:15,931
That's what <i>I'm</i> here for.

714
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:18,114
[ Chuckles ]

715
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:25,125
That lock... it wasn't busted before.

716
00:41:28,428 --> 00:41:29,547
Ready?

717
00:41:29,676 --> 00:41:31,143
[ Gun cocks ]

718
00:41:35,864 --> 00:41:37,312
So far, so good.

719
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:40,507
Everyone, stay alert. Come on.

720
00:41:43,316 --> 00:41:45,784
Regina: There's definitely
dark magic here.

721
00:41:49,816 --> 00:41:50,983
[ Sighs ]

722
00:41:51,684 --> 00:41:53,479
Can you feel it?

723
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:57,393
I don't know. Maybe.
Whatever I feel, it's not good.

724
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:02,901
What would the Wicked Witch
keep in a cage... monkeys?

725
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:05,338
No, not monkeys.

726
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:14,705
Now, how many people do we know...

727
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,299
who can spin straw into gold?

728
00:42:17,446 --> 00:42:19,547
Rumplestiltskin.

729
00:42:20,518 --> 00:42:40,518
