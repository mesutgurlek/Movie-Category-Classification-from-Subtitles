1
00:00:09,792 --> 00:00:11,868
"We love our mothers unknowingly,

2
00:00:12,086 --> 00:00:14,838
and only realize how deep-rooted
that love is

3
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:16,707
at the ultimate separation."

4
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:22,129
I don't know what happened.

5
00:00:22,763 --> 00:00:24,388
When I was little,

6
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,219
we loved each other.

7
00:00:29,187 --> 00:00:30,467
I still love her.

8
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:33,021
I can look at her,

9
00:00:33,483 --> 00:00:35,025
talk to her,
be next to her.

10
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:36,850
But...

11
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:39,941
I can't be her son.

12
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:43,735
I could be anyone's son.

13
00:00:44,202 --> 00:00:45,530
But not hers.

14
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:44,293
You have cream cheese
all over your mouth.

15
00:01:48,058 --> 00:01:49,433
The other side too.

16
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,636
I wiped both sides.

17
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:54,981
It's good, you got it.

18
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,977
There's just a drop more over there.

19
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:00,361
No, the other side.

20
00:02:02,072 --> 00:02:03,447
It's okay.

21
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,960
I hate when you put
make-up on in the car!

22
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,996
It's totally unsafe.

23
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,131
Can Antonin sleep over on Saturday?

24
00:02:27,097 --> 00:02:30,051
- As long as...
- You don't want to cook, I know!

25
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:33,977
- Why don't you fuckin' shut up?
- What are you doing?

26
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:35,931
I listen to the morning news!

27
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:37,642
That jerk is just busting our balls!

28
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,353
Your balls!

29
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,816
I find him very, very cultured.

30
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,900
Just the other day,
you said he annoyed you.

31
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:47,108
Hubert, if you're not happy...

32
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:50,448
You'll do what you want,
when you're 18, in your car.

33
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:52,869
But I listen to the news in mine.

34
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,118
You weren't even listening!

35
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:57,830
- Yes, I was.
- Okay, I'm all ears...

36
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:01,461
If you're unhappy, take the bus
like kids of your age!

37
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,426
I've had it.

38
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:26,859
- Hey...
- What?

39
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:28,777
What do you want?

40
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:32,907
We can talk.
I'm not just your chauffeur.

41
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:35,993
I'm letting you savor
your news program!

42
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,000
"Savor!", now...

43
00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:41,500
You're the spitting image
of your father.

44
00:03:41,965 --> 00:03:46,259
Can't talk like everyone else.
Always calling attention to yourself.

45
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:48,960
You both think you're king shit.

46
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:54,761
Take a pill!

47
00:03:54,978 --> 00:03:56,437
Rude individual.

48
00:03:58,064 --> 00:04:00,602
- You ran the light.
- No, I didn't!

49
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:02,062
- It was red.
- Yellow.

50
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:03,557
- It was red!
- Yellow!

51
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:05,771
Red! Red! Red! Red!

52
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:08,825
You're a crappy driver,
you put on make-up...

53
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:12,485
I said if you're not happy,
get out and take the bus!

54
00:04:14,122 --> 00:04:16,909
Do a survey to see
if your friends' parents

55
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,584
drive them to school!

56
00:04:18,794 --> 00:04:22,127
Stop asking me to do surveys!
It's such bullshit!

57
00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:24,670
50% of my friends get rides
to school.

58
00:04:24,883 --> 00:04:26,046
You take me for a nitwit!

59
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:28,583
Get out and walk.

60
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:29,966
I'm late.

61
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,134
I don't have time for this milk run.

62
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,675
I'll miss class.
Take the short cut...

63
00:04:35,894 --> 00:04:38,895
I said I'm late. I am late!
Don't you understand?

64
00:04:39,106 --> 00:04:42,190
Should I say it in Spanish?
What a joy giving you a lift.

65
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:43,860
Have a nice day!

66
00:04:53,037 --> 00:04:56,785
I KILLED MY MOTHER

67
00:05:05,507 --> 00:05:08,343
Have you thought about a title
for your painting?

68
00:05:09,803 --> 00:05:11,511
It's in my notebook.

69
00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:13,679
Take a look, it's right there.

70
00:05:16,936 --> 00:05:21,681
Title: The Son

71
00:05:28,572 --> 00:05:32,784
Congratulations, champ!
I'm sure you'll get a gold star!

72
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,871
You'll find the annual salary,
work conditions, and benefits.

73
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,128
For the second half,

74
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,963
you'll interview your parents.
It's all on the sheet, anyway.

75
00:05:48,634 --> 00:05:51,007
Now get into teams.

76
00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:10,900
- Ma'am?
- Yes.

77
00:06:13,243 --> 00:06:15,235
Can I use my aunt's profession?

78
00:06:15,995 --> 00:06:17,703
No, Hubert.

79
00:06:18,164 --> 00:06:22,162
We're establishing statistics
on what parents do most.

80
00:06:23,378 --> 00:06:25,417
Can't you use your parents'

81
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:30,799
I never see my father.

82
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:32,168
And...

83
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:36,840
my mother is dead.

84
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:46,775
Well, of course...

85
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:49,191
you can use your aunt's profession.

86
00:06:49,404 --> 00:06:50,733
- I'm sorry.
- It's ok.

87
00:06:50,947 --> 00:06:52,406
I didn't know.

88
00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:03,369
You know when you stare
at a light...

89
00:07:05,212 --> 00:07:06,920
Then you close your eyes,

90
00:07:07,422 --> 00:07:11,420
and it's black and then
green florescent spots pop up...

91
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:15,502
It's weird because you feel like
you can control them, but...

92
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:20,180
Shut up!

93
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:25,645
You're early.

94
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:29,186
I was training a new recruit.
Never takes long.

95
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:32,068
- Hi, Hubert!
- Hello.

96
00:07:32,322 --> 00:07:33,698
Staying for dinner?

97
00:07:34,742 --> 00:07:36,200
No, I can't, I have to...

98
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:38,150
Hey, new recruit!

99
00:07:38,537 --> 00:07:40,993
Come on stay.
We'll order sushi...

100
00:07:44,126 --> 00:07:45,953
No, I really have to go home.

101
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,293
Too bad. Another time then.

102
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,254
What about your homework?
Have you been working hard?

103
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:55,670
Yeah! It's crazy.

104
00:07:55,888 --> 00:07:57,797
We're sweating bullets.

105
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:09,234
How was your day?

106
00:08:13,197 --> 00:08:15,190
- I'm talking to you.
- Normal.

107
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:24,120
- You're not asking about mine?
- No.

108
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:25,830
Why?

109
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:29,078
If something special happened,

110
00:08:29,422 --> 00:08:31,830
you would've already told me.

111
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:34,381
The same goes for me.

112
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:39,426
But since it was another wasted day
in a class full of morons,

113
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:41,135
iron-pumping sex addicts

114
00:08:41,351 --> 00:08:45,183
who can't conjugate the verb "to be".
Not worth talking about.

115
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:47,230
It's so uninteresting.

116
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,983
Do you think other kids
use that tone with their mothers?

117
00:08:57,784 --> 00:09:01,034
Do you think other mothers raised
their kids like you did?

118
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,874
This isn't a hotel!

119
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:11,877
I'm not just a cook who feeds you,
and drives you around at your whim.

120
00:09:12,716 --> 00:09:15,289
We could talk.
We used to talk.

121
00:09:16,386 --> 00:09:18,094
"Used to."

122
00:09:19,598 --> 00:09:22,053
I was 4 and had no one else.

123
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:42,787
The steak is good.

124
00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:47,625
It's tasty.

125
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:50,116
I'm glad.

126
00:09:51,213 --> 00:09:54,380
At least I'm not breaking
my ass for nothing. I should...

127
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,044
...hire a maid.

128
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,132
Yeah... I know!

129
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,800
You've said it 40 billion times!

130
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:06,176
You have Alzheimer's.

131
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:18,990
Anyway...

132
00:10:19,366 --> 00:10:22,570
Antonin is gonna come
before dinner on Saturday.

133
00:10:22,786 --> 00:10:25,622
But I'll cook, we'll have toast.

134
00:10:26,332 --> 00:10:27,494
Oh really?

135
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,909
And it's too much to ask me first?

136
00:10:30,544 --> 00:10:32,916
I asked you in the car
this morning.

137
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:35,961
Impossible, Denise invited us over.

138
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:37,755
Are you kidding?

139
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:41,836
I asked you in the car this morning
and you said yes!

140
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,309
See, I'm totally right.
You've got Alzheimer's!

141
00:10:45,518 --> 00:10:48,768
Don't go there, Hubert Minel!
Don't be manipulative!

142
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,138
I'm fed up with this bullshit...

143
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:53,149
Okay, then...

144
00:10:54,235 --> 00:10:56,690
I'll go to Antonin's.
Problem solved.

145
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:57,942
Out of the question!

146
00:10:58,155 --> 00:11:00,314
Denise is expecting you.
She loves you!

147
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:02,157
She wants you to be there!

148
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:05,784
She bought a big beautiful
veal shank! 40 bucks! We're going!

149
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:06,779
I don't give a shit!

150
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:08,956
I have a life too!

151
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:11,290
I'm seeing Antonin on Saturday!

152
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:13,542
Have fun with Denise
and her shanks!

153
00:11:13,796 --> 00:11:17,130
Do that and say goodbye
to your weekly allowance.

154
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:21,383
Blackmail, now! Great!
Grandma would be proud to see...

155
00:11:21,596 --> 00:11:24,348
I'm in charge of that inheritance
until you're 18!

156
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:28,264
If you're not happy, go live
with your father! Am I clear?

157
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:05,838
I hate you.

158
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:08,764
Well, go on, Hubert! Hate me!

159
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:11,848
Hate those who contradict you,
those who are right!

160
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,352
I've also hated people in my life.

161
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:16,606
Am I dead? No, I'm still here!

162
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,744
Stop singing
when you're uncomfortable!

163
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,744
Classic reaction!

164
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:32,331
I'm not uncomfortable,
This conversation is over!

165
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:41,088
Fine!

166
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:44,172
Tell Denise I can't come,
that I'm not free...

167
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:47,093
Tell her I'm sorry
I couldn't make it.

168
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,011
She'll be sad, but
that's the least of your worries.

169
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:54,431
People's feelings aren't
your concern.

170
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:02,193
When I try to imagine what the worst
mother in the world is like...

171
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,529
I can't do better than you.

172
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,860
How nice.

173
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,248
Lovely evening.

174
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,341
She didn't want me.

175
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,969
I'm just a burden.

176
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,464
She wasn't made to be a mother.

177
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,137
She got married
and had a kid because...

178
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:34,058
that's what everyone
expected of her.

179
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,976
That's what everyone
still expects of women.

180
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,224
Well...

181
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,272
almost everyone.

182
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,741
For the sa... the salaries,
it will...

183
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,949
It'll be between 35 and 45 grand.

184
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,918
I'm going to talk to you
about the social advantages.

185
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:10,094
Social advantages
are really insane because...

186
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:13,468
You!

187
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,353
I need to talk to you after class!

188
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,978
Do I look fucking dead,
for Christ's sake?

189
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:24,899
Okay! Everyone, please!

190
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,447
Quiet down, everyone.

191
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,486
Go back to your seats, guys!

192
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,991
Please!

193
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,217
Hubert, come here!

194
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,215
Hubert Minel!

195
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,385
I want to talk to you!

196
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,118
Why did you say that
to your teacher?

197
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,957
Don't touch me!

198
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:42,015
Hubert, get in.

199
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:52,031
It's my job to make sure
you're safe and sound! Get in.

200
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:54,615
Look, I have...

201
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:56,987
I have candy!

202
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:20,020
Why did you lie to me?

203
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,104
It was inevitable I'd find out.

204
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:38,076
I don't have class now,
let's get a bite.

205
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,660
Isn't it illegal for teachers
and students to hang out?

206
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,453
Not as much as killing your mother.

207
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:57,423
You're right, I shouldn't see you
outside of class,

208
00:16:57,644 --> 00:16:59,767
but the other teachers do it, so...

209
00:17:01,773 --> 00:17:04,394
I used to come here
when I was your age.

210
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:08,774
I know...

211
00:17:09,364 --> 00:17:11,357
It's a dive, but...

212
00:17:12,325 --> 00:17:14,448
This place has a special aura.

213
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:19,415
Greasy food, bitter coffee,
the seats are too red, but...

214
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:24,414
- So?
- The Smoked Meat Royal, please.

215
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,248
I'll have the same
with mayo for the fries.

216
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:30,463
And to drink?

217
00:17:30,677 --> 00:17:31,708
Water.

218
00:17:39,978 --> 00:17:44,687
I should've known it was stupid
telling you that my mother was dead.

219
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:48,062
I was a jerk to make that up,
I apologize.

220
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,490
I could never stand my father.

221
00:17:56,328 --> 00:17:57,739
And it hasn't changed.

222
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:05,578
People think that with time,

223
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,463
you start loving your parents
and things work out.

224
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:13,506
But we haven't spoken in 10 years.

225
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:19,598
For me, it's my mom.
We're totally incompatible.

226
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,348
We have absolutely nothing
in common.

227
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:32,154
"The mother of a son
will never be his friend."

228
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:34,729
Cocteau.

229
00:18:37,745 --> 00:18:39,951
"Love thy father and mother."

230
00:18:40,164 --> 00:18:41,113
God.

231
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:44,786
You're Catholic?

232
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:49,710
I believe there's something,

233
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:50,789
someone...

234
00:18:52,635 --> 00:18:55,636
But I don't know if it's God,
or Buddha, or...

235
00:18:55,847 --> 00:18:57,092
I don't know.

236
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:02,184
But I know
He gave me the wrong mother.

237
00:19:11,904 --> 00:19:13,696
Why are you a teacher?

238
00:19:22,498 --> 00:19:24,158
I don't know.

239
00:19:33,843 --> 00:19:35,385
O sinister, cruel woman,

240
00:19:35,595 --> 00:19:38,051
The gloomy pitch
of your shrill voice

241
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:40,755
Brings forth a sad song
that haunts me

242
00:19:40,975 --> 00:19:43,645
And I escape into a lush,
horrific meadow

243
00:19:48,942 --> 00:19:51,100
We should be able to kill ourselves.

244
00:19:54,114 --> 00:19:55,312
In our heads.

245
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:57,944
And then be reborn.

246
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:03,239
To be able to talk,
look at each other,

247
00:20:03,748 --> 00:20:04,993
be together.

248
00:20:06,543 --> 00:20:08,999
As if we never met before.

249
00:20:10,672 --> 00:20:13,080
If my mother and I were strangers,

250
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:16,592
I'm sure we'd get along.

251
00:20:40,035 --> 00:20:42,324
Don't tell him that, you twit!

252
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:44,780
He'll be there any minute!

253
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:48,492
No!

254
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:54,956
I knew it! I told you!
What a nutcase.

255
00:20:57,636 --> 00:20:59,962
- Hi, Mom!
- Hi, Hubert!

256
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,007
Can I have a quick word?

257
00:21:02,224 --> 00:21:04,133
- No, my show's on.
- You're taping it!

258
00:21:04,351 --> 00:21:06,510
Come on, you're taping it.

259
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:08,891
I have to talk to you.

260
00:21:09,106 --> 00:21:12,060
I found the perfect solution.

261
00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:14,017
Oh yeah?

262
00:21:14,236 --> 00:21:16,276
For us. For our relationship.

263
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:18,528
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

264
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,488
I think I should move
into my own apartment.

265
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:24,908
Really...

266
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:29,581
I saw an ad on my way from school.
We could visit it.

267
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:33,996
It seemed nice, and clean.
It's in a good neighborhood.

268
00:21:34,215 --> 00:21:38,544
I'd be close to the subway, close
to school, close to my friends!

269
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:40,718
So, no more driving me around.

270
00:21:41,806 --> 00:21:45,424
You've never even done
your laundry here! You'll go nuts.

271
00:21:45,643 --> 00:21:48,810
Well, here... it's because
you're always on my back!

272
00:21:49,022 --> 00:21:50,979
Yes! That's why!

273
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:55,484
I won't have the choice there.
I won't live in a pigsty!

274
00:21:55,695 --> 00:21:58,020
I'll have to clean up my own shit.

275
00:21:58,239 --> 00:21:59,899
I know it'll work.

276
00:22:03,036 --> 00:22:05,609
- With Grandma's money?
- Yes, exactly.

277
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,622
That's what I was thinking!

278
00:22:07,832 --> 00:22:10,288
We're really on the same wavelength!

279
00:22:13,546 --> 00:22:15,206
Yes, it's a good idea.

280
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:17,757
I'm so happy, Mom.

281
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:20,133
I love you! I love you!

282
00:22:20,345 --> 00:22:22,752
- Okay, so you're happy?
- Yes.

283
00:22:22,972 --> 00:22:25,179
I'm gonna visit it. I'm so happy!

284
00:22:25,392 --> 00:22:27,598
I love you, my sweet little mommy!

285
00:22:32,524 --> 00:22:33,769
Crappy crap.

286
00:22:34,526 --> 00:22:37,278
I rented this flat
to a bunch of pigs.

287
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:39,936
It was so goddamn filthy,
I had to repaint.

288
00:22:40,157 --> 00:22:43,822
Okay, guys, here's the bathroom.

289
00:22:44,035 --> 00:22:48,329
Toilet, bathtub, shower,
sink with medicine cabinet.

290
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,624
It's clean.
Here's some place for your junk.

291
00:22:52,627 --> 00:22:55,747
And buddy,
here you have a closet.

292
00:22:55,964 --> 00:22:58,669
A fucking big one.
Can shove lots inside.

293
00:22:58,884 --> 00:23:00,960
Corridor, corridor, corridor...

294
00:23:01,637 --> 00:23:03,428
And here's the kitchen!

295
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:06,220
End of the line, passengers!

296
00:23:06,683 --> 00:23:08,641
If you're interested...

297
00:23:08,852 --> 00:23:11,474
I'll put in a stove,
fridge, the works.

298
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:13,269
Cool!

299
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:16,307
It's perfect for me.

300
00:23:17,152 --> 00:23:19,822
Yeah, it's really nice.

301
00:23:20,364 --> 00:23:22,024
I'll be in touch real soon.

302
00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:24,613
Okey-Dokey! Sounds like a plan.

303
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:28,239
There's one thing...
I don't want any trouble.

304
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:30,697
The neighbors like peace and quiet.

305
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,909
Okay? Fine...

306
00:23:33,752 --> 00:23:36,457
I've gotta run. I've got work to do.

307
00:23:36,672 --> 00:23:38,047
Let's go.

308
00:23:45,347 --> 00:23:47,055
Mom, I have to talk to you.

309
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:50,302
- My show's about to start.
- It'll take two seconds.

310
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,144
Wait till the commercial.

311
00:23:52,354 --> 00:23:53,553
Mom...

312
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,313
I saw the apartment.

313
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:58,023
Which apartment?

314
00:23:58,402 --> 00:23:59,778
The one I told you about.

315
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,898
It's so perfect for me.

316
00:24:05,117 --> 00:24:06,149
I can't believe it!

317
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:08,824
The bedroom's big,
the bathroom's perfect.

318
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:10,912
Heat and electricity are included!

319
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:12,995
Hubert...

320
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,991
I thought it over.

321
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:18,247
At 16, it's nuts to have
your own apartment.

322
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:20,915
Wait till you're 18, okay, honey?

323
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,209
Excuse me?

324
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:28,679
Yesterday you said
it was a great idea.

325
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:32,892
Are you screwing with me?

326
00:24:33,146 --> 00:24:34,556
We talked about it yesterday!

327
00:24:34,814 --> 00:24:38,349
Hubert Minel,
it makes no sense to move out at 16.

328
00:24:38,568 --> 00:24:40,726
You're dreaming in colors!
You poor thing.

329
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,654
You make me sick!

330
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,574
You make me sick!

331
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:47,861
You lead me on!

332
00:24:48,203 --> 00:24:49,401
Go, go, go...

333
00:24:50,955 --> 00:24:54,040
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

334
00:24:55,502 --> 00:24:58,040
No, no, no, no!
What about the ants?

335
00:24:58,254 --> 00:25:00,924
- Ants!
- Fuck the ants? Fuck you!

336
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:04,382
Get your ass over here
and clean up this mess!

337
00:25:04,594 --> 00:25:06,136
Fuck you!

338
00:26:02,152 --> 00:26:04,145
When I say it, I mean it.

339
00:26:05,072 --> 00:26:06,235
It's true, I love her.

340
00:26:06,824 --> 00:26:09,694
But it's not the love of a son.

341
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:13,659
It's strange...

342
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,616
if someone hurt her,

343
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:18,454
I'd want to kill him. I'd kill him.

344
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,159
And yet,

345
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:24,665
I can think of a hundred people
I love more than my mother.

346
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:30,465
Oh, you bastard!

347
00:26:34,643 --> 00:26:36,601
Smells good in here!

348
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:39,221
I just came back
from a PTA meeting.

349
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,607
I peeked at your art.
Hubert, I didn't know you painted!

350
00:26:43,194 --> 00:26:44,688
- It's fabulous.
- Thanks.

351
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:46,943
No, really, you both amaze me.

352
00:26:47,323 --> 00:26:49,861
So I thought you could redo
my office!

353
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:52,318
You could throw things on the wall.

354
00:26:52,537 --> 00:26:55,703
You know, splatters, splashes!
Help me out!

355
00:26:55,957 --> 00:26:58,080
Humans call that "dripping", Mom.

356
00:26:58,334 --> 00:26:59,579
That's it, dripping.

357
00:27:00,002 --> 00:27:03,288
You'd have a free hand!
It's an ad agency,

358
00:27:03,548 --> 00:27:05,090
not a tax office.

359
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:06,539
I'd love to.

360
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:07,755
Wonderful!

361
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:10,177
Say yes or I'm kicking you out.

362
00:27:11,556 --> 00:27:13,015
Come help set the table.

363
00:27:13,474 --> 00:27:16,678
No, no, no! I'm so zen here.
Total Nirvana!

364
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,977
Come on, lazy head!

365
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,689
Crazy bitch!

366
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,189
No, stop it!

367
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,888
Hello!

368
00:28:08,238 --> 00:28:09,816
Hubert? Are you home?

369
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:21,829
There you are.

370
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:24,170
Look what I bought.

371
00:28:28,383 --> 00:28:30,423
I'm sure you'll hate it.

372
00:28:33,764 --> 00:28:35,009
Yes, ma'am.

373
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:36,549
It's lovely.

374
00:28:40,562 --> 00:28:42,187
I don't hate it.

375
00:28:43,607 --> 00:28:44,686
It's kind of...

376
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,601
It's kind of safari.

377
00:28:49,905 --> 00:28:52,028
I like fur patterns.

378
00:28:53,742 --> 00:28:55,818
It warms up interiors.

379
00:28:56,579 --> 00:28:59,663
And it goes so well
with that painting.

380
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:01,826
It goes with the...

381
00:29:02,459 --> 00:29:04,915
The tiger's stripes.
That's why I bought it.

382
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,042
It's lovely.

383
00:29:25,316 --> 00:29:26,775
I love you.

384
00:29:30,488 --> 00:29:32,445
I love you too, sweetheart.

385
00:29:38,454 --> 00:29:39,996
I'm telling you...

386
00:29:40,206 --> 00:29:43,123
so you won't forget.

387
00:30:49,735 --> 00:30:52,736
Now this is what I call
a beautiful plate!

388
00:30:58,201 --> 00:30:59,779
These eggs are terrific!

389
00:30:59,995 --> 00:31:01,786
- You like it?
- It's delicious.

390
00:31:01,997 --> 00:31:03,325
Did you add coriander?

391
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,114
- Yes. I know you like that.
- I sure do.

392
00:31:06,335 --> 00:31:07,829
You did it for me.

393
00:31:08,712 --> 00:31:12,413
It's good. It gives it
a little Asian-lndian taste.

394
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,793
They put it in couscous too.

395
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,501
Moroccans... North Africans.

396
00:31:19,098 --> 00:31:21,767
Gives it an international flare.

397
00:31:23,602 --> 00:31:25,476
How was your week at work?

398
00:31:26,772 --> 00:31:27,935
Good.

399
00:31:29,316 --> 00:31:31,273
It's a bit frenzied, but...

400
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:33,647
it's fine.

401
00:31:41,078 --> 00:31:42,323
What's that noise?

402
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:44,365
Am I hearing things?

403
00:31:45,332 --> 00:31:49,033
It's the washing machine.
I did a wash this morning.

404
00:31:49,587 --> 00:31:50,997
You did?

405
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:56,710
- That's nice.
- Yep.

406
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,184
The dishes too?
Have you been brainwashed?

407
00:32:16,531 --> 00:32:17,941
That's Denise!

408
00:32:25,498 --> 00:32:26,245
Denise!

409
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:29,952
- Hello, sugar! How is she?
- Fine!

410
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:32,921
Why go?
You're brown enough already!

411
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:35,289
You have to keep up a tan, girl!

412
00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:39,588
Take a look... the suit you got me
from Fort Lauderdale!

413
00:32:39,804 --> 00:32:41,002
- Foxy!
- Cute, huh?

414
00:32:41,222 --> 00:32:42,052
Hi, lovie!

415
00:32:43,516 --> 00:32:46,601
Mister is doing the dishes!
What's the occasion?

416
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:49,896
What'd you give him?
I want some for mine!

417
00:32:50,106 --> 00:32:52,680
- For your husband or son?
- Both of them!

418
00:32:53,234 --> 00:32:54,432
You're nuts!

419
00:32:55,945 --> 00:32:58,567
You always crack me up, Denise.

420
00:32:59,282 --> 00:33:01,773
We're off to get a tan,
but will be back.

421
00:33:02,035 --> 00:33:03,659
Want to eat with us?

422
00:33:09,626 --> 00:33:11,037
Want to eat with us?

423
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:18,250
I'm making pesto pasta.

424
00:33:18,468 --> 00:33:21,920
I'll cook and when you get back,
we'll eat together.

425
00:33:23,473 --> 00:33:24,967
How nice.

426
00:33:26,727 --> 00:33:28,387
I just need 5 minutes.

427
00:33:28,603 --> 00:33:32,186
Go ahead, I'll have a little chat
with your son.

428
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,975
Come see my hibiscus.
It's gorgeous.

429
00:33:36,194 --> 00:33:38,768
It has a huge salmon red flower!

430
00:33:39,031 --> 00:33:42,281
- Two feet big!
- Mine hasn't bloomed yet. Salmon?

431
00:33:43,452 --> 00:33:45,907
I need a tan! I'm white as a ghost!

432
00:33:46,121 --> 00:33:47,615
No, you're not.

433
00:33:47,831 --> 00:33:50,287
Sylvain isn't keen
on us getting tan.

434
00:33:50,501 --> 00:33:53,336
He keeps showing me
articles on cancer...

435
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:55,419
It's not even real sun!

436
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:57,671
You're right, I'll tell him.

437
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,295
Hello!

438
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:07,257
We met at PTA meetings.

439
00:34:07,476 --> 00:34:09,884
Helene Rimbaud,
I'm Antonin's mother.

440
00:34:10,104 --> 00:34:11,017
Of course!

441
00:34:11,272 --> 00:34:13,063
- How are you?
- Very well.

442
00:34:13,274 --> 00:34:14,436
I'm waiting for my mother.

443
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,271
She likes getting tanned,
it's not my thing.

444
00:34:22,074 --> 00:34:24,696
Our boys...
Two months in a week!

445
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:26,911
- Two months?
- Yes.

446
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:31,246
- Two months... what?
- That they've been together!

447
00:34:44,138 --> 00:34:45,716
Chantal Lemming!

448
00:34:47,725 --> 00:34:49,267
Chantal Lemming?

449
00:34:50,561 --> 00:34:52,435
Cabin 13, your turn.

450
00:35:34,981 --> 00:35:37,021
- I'll quit on my birthday.
- So will I.

451
00:35:37,233 --> 00:35:38,478
- We'll do it.
- Yes, ma'am.

452
00:35:38,735 --> 00:35:40,194
Anyway, it's too expensive.

453
00:35:40,403 --> 00:35:43,025
That's for sure,
they cost a fortune.

454
00:35:45,492 --> 00:35:48,446
Now I know why Hubert's
been so strange...

455
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,359
You think?

456
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:55,373
The laundry, the pesto...

457
00:35:55,752 --> 00:35:57,377
He was paving the way.

458
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,958
Poor baby.

459
00:36:03,677 --> 00:36:07,627
He was obsessed with
Leo DiCaprio in Titanic.

460
00:36:07,848 --> 00:36:10,136
He wrote him a letter in English.
So cute.

461
00:36:19,026 --> 00:36:21,232
He used to tell me everything.

462
00:36:24,281 --> 00:36:26,986
Now I'm criticized
for everything I say.

463
00:36:27,201 --> 00:36:29,324
Every word, every move is wrong.

464
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:32,784
It's as if...

465
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:36,455
It's as if everything was erased.

466
00:36:36,668 --> 00:36:38,127
It's as if...

467
00:36:39,088 --> 00:36:40,202
I don't know.

468
00:36:42,508 --> 00:36:44,216
It feels like...

469
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,047
it's all over.

470
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:49,755
Our special moments, our trips...

471
00:36:51,225 --> 00:36:54,594
It's as if it all disappeared.
Funny, isn't it?

472
00:37:01,443 --> 00:37:02,902
It's a big deal...

473
00:37:04,196 --> 00:37:05,477
being...

474
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,317
a homosexual.

475
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,323
Big stuff.

476
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,555
I have to go to the market.

477
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:35,811
Come! I'll drop you at the video
store then come back to pick you up.

478
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,345
- What do you say?
- Sure.

479
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:40,314
I love you, sweetheart.

480
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:42,103
I love you, too.

481
00:37:44,278 --> 00:37:46,567
Hurry up before it closes.

482
00:37:46,781 --> 00:37:48,406
- Hurry!
- I'm coming.

483
00:38:10,013 --> 00:38:11,507
Dammit.

484
00:38:12,015 --> 00:38:14,091
I won't set up camp here.

485
00:38:24,361 --> 00:38:27,611
I've been waiting forever!
Two minutes or I'm gone!

486
00:38:27,822 --> 00:38:28,854
Fed up with this.

487
00:38:29,824 --> 00:38:31,283
Next!

488
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:37,988
Phone number, please.

489
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,167
450-555-6352

490
00:38:43,672 --> 00:38:46,589
You've got 2 regular films
and one Blu Ray.

491
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,547
A "Blue" what?

492
00:38:48,301 --> 00:38:51,468
We have an offer,
three new releases for three days.

493
00:38:51,722 --> 00:38:53,180
But not with Blu Rays.

494
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:54,807
Want to exchange it?

495
00:38:56,476 --> 00:38:57,472
Fuck!

496
00:39:34,765 --> 00:39:36,758
That was the last time!

497
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:43,523
I'm twiddling my thumbs
while His Majesty chooses his films!

498
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:47,267
- You don't understand anything.
- Of course not, I'm an idiot!

499
00:39:48,028 --> 00:39:51,563
Why drive off if you're gonna stop?
To piss me off?

500
00:39:52,783 --> 00:39:54,657
- Do a survey...
- Another one!

501
00:39:54,869 --> 00:39:57,538
I wonder if your friends' mothers

502
00:39:57,747 --> 00:40:00,154
drive them to the video store.

503
00:40:01,334 --> 00:40:05,414
Next time, take your bike.
I can't keep doing you favours.

504
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,958
"Favours?"

505
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:09,878
It was your idea
for me to come with you!

506
00:40:10,092 --> 00:40:13,296
How should I know
you'd wank off for 45 minutes?

507
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:16,385
Your selfishness blows my mind!

508
00:40:17,183 --> 00:40:18,346
There was a line!

509
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:23,056
Should I have trampled on people
because mother dearest tarries?

510
00:40:23,272 --> 00:40:26,439
You had to start yelling
in front of everyone!

511
00:40:26,651 --> 00:40:28,275
- Yelling!
- Yes, yelling!

512
00:40:28,486 --> 00:40:30,894
And you're not yelling now?

513
00:40:37,912 --> 00:40:40,747
I think it's time you go live
with your father.

514
00:40:40,957 --> 00:40:43,495
I'm at the end of my rope.

515
00:40:44,002 --> 00:40:45,081
The end!

516
00:40:47,505 --> 00:40:49,877
I knew you had Alzheimer's,

517
00:40:50,091 --> 00:40:52,878
but I didn't know
you were also blind!

518
00:40:53,094 --> 00:40:55,003
- Now it's something else.
- Yes!

519
00:40:55,221 --> 00:40:56,716
What about today?

520
00:40:56,931 --> 00:40:58,556
You didn't notice a thing!

521
00:40:58,767 --> 00:41:01,055
- What?
- The laundry, the dishes!

522
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:04,519
Everything! The dinner!
I tried to make you happy!

523
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:06,724
Congratulations, Hubert.

524
00:41:06,942 --> 00:41:09,065
Sweet Jesus, how fantastic!

525
00:41:09,653 --> 00:41:12,570
You cook, you clean,
you wipe shit once a year!

526
00:41:12,781 --> 00:41:16,197
Want a medal for finally acting
like kids of your age?

527
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:18,782
Stop comparing me
to "kids of my age!"

528
00:41:18,995 --> 00:41:20,538
Stop doing that!

529
00:41:20,747 --> 00:41:24,033
I'm not like them!
And you're not like their mothers!

530
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:27,371
- We're unique!
- Yes, Hubert! You're always right!

531
00:41:27,587 --> 00:41:29,379
Yes, I am right! I'm right!

532
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:30,870
I hate you!

533
00:41:31,758 --> 00:41:33,134
I can't stand you!

534
00:41:33,343 --> 00:41:36,546
You can't stand anyone.
Not me, or anyone else!

535
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,338
I don't want to live
with you anymore!

536
00:41:39,558 --> 00:41:41,100
I just want to vanish.

537
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:44,560
Escape to a desert island!
I'd dig a hole in the sand

538
00:41:44,771 --> 00:41:46,479
without air, without water...

539
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:49,976
And before kicking the bucket,
you'll call me:

540
00:41:50,194 --> 00:41:53,111
"Mom, I'm hungry,
I'm thirsty. I'm sorry!"

541
00:41:53,322 --> 00:41:54,567
You're never content.

542
00:41:54,782 --> 00:41:56,988
Stop talking when I am!

543
00:41:57,201 --> 00:41:59,443
Listen to me once in a while!

544
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,118
We could try to communicate!

545
00:42:02,331 --> 00:42:04,620
It's no wonder you're still single!

546
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:07,585
You're just like your mother:
fucking crazy!

547
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,358
What are you doing?

548
00:42:35,573 --> 00:42:36,604
Stop.

549
00:42:36,824 --> 00:42:37,855
Open the door.

550
00:42:38,075 --> 00:42:39,024
It's open.

551
00:42:39,243 --> 00:42:42,410
Open the fucking door, it's locked!

552
00:42:43,664 --> 00:42:44,945
Need a hand?

553
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:47,203
How can you laugh?

554
00:42:47,418 --> 00:42:50,538
- How can you laugh?
- I'm laughing inside.

555
00:42:51,506 --> 00:42:53,083
It's open, go on.

556
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,551
What the hell are you doing?

557
00:42:58,262 --> 00:43:00,800
What are you doing?
Don't crawl over me!

558
00:43:01,015 --> 00:43:03,685
Hello! I'm here.
You're laughing too!

559
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,220
Your fat ass!

560
00:43:06,437 --> 00:43:09,011
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

561
00:43:09,232 --> 00:43:10,691
Excuse me!

562
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,020
- Move your foot.
- Don't touch me, dammit!

563
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,288
Did you forget your keys?

564
00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:35,665
Help me with the groceries.

565
00:43:39,804 --> 00:43:41,927
Help me with the groceries!

566
00:43:45,852 --> 00:43:48,687
Fine, little man,
we can both play that game!

567
00:44:30,731 --> 00:44:32,011
Hubert?

568
00:44:35,986 --> 00:44:37,149
Hubert?

569
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,575
Antonin?

570
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:27,778
Hubert?

571
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:30,496
You have to call your mom.

572
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:35,709
You can't just turn up
here like this.

573
00:45:36,422 --> 00:45:39,423
I can't house runaway students.

574
00:45:39,634 --> 00:45:41,211
I could lose my job.

575
00:45:41,427 --> 00:45:44,512
I didn't run away.
It's just a break.

576
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,516
I know, it's old-fogey here.

577
00:45:57,527 --> 00:46:00,196
This used to be
my grandmother's place.

578
00:46:09,998 --> 00:46:11,789
Very intelligent running away!

579
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:13,744
Are you referring to...

580
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:18,078
when you ran off
from the video store or from home?

581
00:46:18,298 --> 00:46:19,413
Watch your tone.

582
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,379
Where are you?

583
00:46:21,593 --> 00:46:22,708
At Antonin's.

584
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:29,463
I'm not coming home
tomorrow either.

585
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:33,228
You're taking roots
at your friend's house?

586
00:46:38,401 --> 00:46:39,564
At least here...

587
00:46:40,278 --> 00:46:41,607
I love them.

588
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,739
And they love me.

589
00:46:46,326 --> 00:46:49,244
When will your purgatory be over?

590
00:46:50,539 --> 00:46:54,750
So in your mind,
living with you is paradise?

591
00:46:56,253 --> 00:46:57,533
I don't know when I'll be back.

592
00:46:58,589 --> 00:47:02,836
But for now, go to the 3rd drawer
of my night table.

593
00:47:03,051 --> 00:47:07,595
Under my drawings is an old copy
of "Philosophy in the Bedroom".

594
00:47:07,806 --> 00:47:09,633
Trust me, time will fly...

595
00:47:19,234 --> 00:47:21,939
You can't talk
to your mother like that!

596
00:47:22,655 --> 00:47:25,691
I'm sure she's not easy
to live with, but...

597
00:47:41,507 --> 00:47:42,966
When I was little,

598
00:47:43,884 --> 00:47:46,292
my mother and I were like friends.

599
00:47:47,763 --> 00:47:51,298
Her work colleagues
told her what a spoiled brat I was,

600
00:47:51,517 --> 00:47:54,055
and how they would've
already whacked me!

601
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:56,892
They're the type of ladies who say:

602
00:47:57,523 --> 00:47:59,480
"It's particular."

603
00:48:01,861 --> 00:48:03,272
It's so irritating.

604
00:48:03,487 --> 00:48:05,527
When people say "particular",

605
00:48:06,657 --> 00:48:10,441
they lack the intelligence
to understand "difference".

606
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:14,706
Or to appreciate it. Or have
the guts to admit they hate it.

607
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:20,331
My mother often says
that I'm "particular".

608
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,088
Good morning.

609
00:48:27,303 --> 00:48:29,095
Good morning, thanks.

610
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:44,935
Hubert?

611
00:48:46,072 --> 00:48:50,319
I could get into a lot of trouble
if anyone found out you're here.

612
00:48:50,535 --> 00:48:51,566
Don't worry.

613
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:20,226
Why can't I be like the others?

614
00:49:22,776 --> 00:49:26,394
Kids my age
think their moms are pains

615
00:49:26,613 --> 00:49:28,238
but they still love them.

616
00:49:30,409 --> 00:49:33,445
I don't think I was made
to have a mother.

617
00:49:35,998 --> 00:49:38,833
Maybe your mother
wasn't made to have a son.

618
00:49:43,088 --> 00:49:45,247
Page 131.

619
00:49:45,466 --> 00:49:47,375
Letter number 26.

620
00:49:48,302 --> 00:49:50,627
Tourvel refuses Valmont's love.

621
00:49:51,305 --> 00:49:52,680
Fucking whore.

622
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,597
But deep down, Tourvel...

623
00:49:56,769 --> 00:49:57,717
Hub?

624
00:50:01,857 --> 00:50:03,897
Daydreaming, Vicomte?

625
00:50:15,663 --> 00:50:16,861
Yes, and you?

626
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:18,279
How are you?

627
00:50:22,294 --> 00:50:25,414
Nothing...
just some homework with a friend.

628
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:31,094
This afternoon?

629
00:50:38,311 --> 00:50:39,556
I'm on my way.

630
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:47,308
Who was that?

631
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,443
My father.

632
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:52,491
What did he want?

633
00:50:53,242 --> 00:50:55,864
He wants us to rent some movies...

634
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,118
watch them and eat spaghetti,

635
00:50:58,331 --> 00:50:59,825
like when I was little.

636
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:02,416
You never talk about him.

637
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:05,671
Yeah, I know.

638
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:08,548
Well...

639
00:51:09,968 --> 00:51:12,256
My parents split up when I was 7.

640
00:51:12,929 --> 00:51:14,922
My mom says my father...

641
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:18,391
got scared,
that parenting wasn't his thing.

642
00:51:19,227 --> 00:51:21,101
And then he left.

643
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:23,388
He didn't go far, but he left.

644
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:29,979
Now I hardly ever see him.
At Christmas, Easter...

645
00:51:32,824 --> 00:51:34,864
He sends cards and money.

646
00:51:37,078 --> 00:51:38,537
His loss.

647
00:51:44,461 --> 00:51:46,833
- Hello, Hubert. Come in.
- Hi!

648
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:59,591
I'm so happy you invited me over.

649
00:52:00,894 --> 00:52:02,222
Because...

650
00:52:02,437 --> 00:52:05,272
It's been hell at home
with Mom lately.

651
00:52:07,818 --> 00:52:10,391
I've been staying
at a friend's house.

652
00:52:12,447 --> 00:52:14,072
- No fucking way!
- Stay here.

653
00:52:14,283 --> 00:52:17,782
You said we'd have
a spaghetti night! You lied!

654
00:52:17,995 --> 00:52:20,153
We will,
but first we need to talk.

655
00:52:20,372 --> 00:52:23,124
The atmosphere is perfect,
what a blast!

656
00:52:27,212 --> 00:52:28,790
Want to drink something?

657
00:52:40,851 --> 00:52:41,930
Hello, Hubert.

658
00:52:53,113 --> 00:52:54,228
So?

659
00:52:56,617 --> 00:53:00,946
Your mother and I have made
an important decision.

660
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,116
Your report card is a disaster.

661
00:53:05,918 --> 00:53:07,626
Despite your proficiency in French.

662
00:53:07,878 --> 00:53:09,752
Who cares? It's October.

663
00:53:09,964 --> 00:53:11,078
I'll work harder.

664
00:53:14,969 --> 00:53:17,341
We're sending you
to boarding school.

665
00:53:18,097 --> 00:53:18,844
Excuse me?

666
00:53:19,265 --> 00:53:21,258
In Coaticook, near Magog.

667
00:53:21,809 --> 00:53:22,805
It's a nice place,

668
00:53:23,978 --> 00:53:25,258
in the middle of nature.

669
00:53:25,521 --> 00:53:27,846
You'll find pictures
on their website.

670
00:53:28,649 --> 00:53:30,772
The countryside will inspire you.

671
00:53:31,277 --> 00:53:32,308
You'll like it.

672
00:53:33,529 --> 00:53:35,237
No, I won't!

673
00:53:35,448 --> 00:53:37,939
Hey guys, I'm in 11th grade!

674
00:53:38,493 --> 00:53:41,244
Nobody changes schools
in 11th grade!

675
00:53:41,746 --> 00:53:43,952
I don't want to go
to boarding school!

676
00:53:44,248 --> 00:53:46,704
If it helps you graduate, you will.

677
00:53:46,918 --> 00:53:48,745
Ad augusta, per angusta.

678
00:53:52,549 --> 00:53:54,340
"To high places by narrow roads."

679
00:53:56,928 --> 00:54:00,131
The atmosphere will be different.
It's much stricter.

680
00:54:00,348 --> 00:54:01,759
You need supervision.

681
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,510
- And your mother...
- Can't handle me?

682
00:54:05,186 --> 00:54:07,475
- It's not that.
- What the hell is it, then?

683
00:54:08,148 --> 00:54:10,187
Lower your voice!

684
00:54:10,442 --> 00:54:13,976
Can we try to talk
as civilized adults?

685
00:54:14,195 --> 00:54:15,109
No, we can't!

686
00:54:15,697 --> 00:54:16,895
Who are you?

687
00:54:17,115 --> 00:54:20,401
We haven't seen each other
or talked in 4 months!

688
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:23,780
We never spend time together!
You're always working!

689
00:54:23,997 --> 00:54:25,076
And boom, you're here!

690
00:54:25,332 --> 00:54:27,455
Attacking in full force!

691
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:29,162
You're ruining my life.

692
00:54:29,377 --> 00:54:31,169
What the fuck is this?
Fuck you!

693
00:54:31,421 --> 00:54:32,796
Enough, Hubert!

694
00:54:33,048 --> 00:54:33,794
Richard, calm down.

695
00:54:34,049 --> 00:54:35,792
I am very calm!

696
00:54:46,395 --> 00:54:49,396
I don't want to go to the country.

697
00:54:50,357 --> 00:54:51,555
I don't belong there.

698
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,976
Why not? The country is calm.

699
00:54:54,236 --> 00:54:55,398
That's not the point!

700
00:54:57,614 --> 00:54:59,239
They're fucking rednecks!

701
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,625
Fuck!

702
00:55:20,387 --> 00:55:22,047
I made some tea.

703
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,890
I know it might seem
a bit "British psychopath..."

704
00:55:26,894 --> 00:55:29,563
- Milk or sugar?
- Milk, please.

705
00:55:31,774 --> 00:55:33,517
Take off your coat.

706
00:55:33,734 --> 00:55:35,359
No, I'll keep it on.

707
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:41,700
I read what you wrote
for French class.

708
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:43,403
Your stories and poems,

709
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:45,446
your novel exercise.

710
00:55:46,497 --> 00:55:47,576
Well...

711
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:52,251
I know I should've spoken with you,
but I couldn't resist.

712
00:55:53,004 --> 00:55:56,207
I signed you up for
the "Young Author" contest.

713
00:55:57,174 --> 00:55:59,297
Since it had to be sent in
by a teacher

714
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:02,595
and it didn't occur
to your French teacher...

715
00:56:04,974 --> 00:56:06,468
What's wrong?

716
00:56:07,101 --> 00:56:08,560
I shouldn't have?

717
00:56:09,103 --> 00:56:10,645
No, it's not that.

718
00:56:11,689 --> 00:56:13,100
What is it then?

719
00:56:18,321 --> 00:56:21,073
My parents are sending me
to boarding school.

720
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,318
They're forcing me.

721
00:56:27,538 --> 00:56:29,661
It all happened very quickly.

722
00:56:35,964 --> 00:56:38,633
That's why you've been
so down all week.

723
00:56:45,432 --> 00:56:47,140
When are you leaving?

724
00:56:49,853 --> 00:56:51,347
Tonight.

725
00:56:55,066 --> 00:56:57,736
I came to say thank you
for everything.

726
00:57:06,912 --> 00:57:07,694
Well...

727
00:57:07,913 --> 00:57:12,622
I have to go and finish packing.
I don't want to be late.

728
00:57:12,834 --> 00:57:14,245
Hubert...

729
00:57:16,963 --> 00:57:17,912
Yes?

730
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,759
In any case,

731
00:57:21,968 --> 00:57:25,420
you're still eligible
for the "Young Author" contest.

732
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:34,059
Good luck in boarding school.

733
00:57:47,619 --> 00:57:49,778
I'll come see you on the weekends.

734
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:52,321
Wait.

735
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:08,887
Here.

736
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:10,808
Page 218, last stanza.

737
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:13,887
- Thank you.
- Get out of here.

738
00:59:00,985 --> 00:59:04,235
Mother, I confess
The snares of a spurious world

739
00:59:04,447 --> 00:59:06,356
Steer away my feeble keel

740
00:59:06,574 --> 00:59:09,908
I must owe all happiness
To maternal tenderness

741
00:59:13,748 --> 00:59:15,290
So, are you suicidal?

742
00:59:17,627 --> 00:59:20,663
You know boarding schools
are full of fags.

743
00:59:22,424 --> 00:59:25,294
So I bought you a chastity belt.

744
00:59:27,929 --> 00:59:29,423
Not really...

745
00:59:30,765 --> 00:59:31,714
But,

746
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:34,468
I made you something.

747
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:37,893
So you'll think of me, and...

748
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,191
you won't cheat on me
with the first fairy?

749
00:59:43,153 --> 00:59:43,817
This is me.

750
00:59:49,034 --> 00:59:50,576
This is you.

751
00:59:55,499 --> 00:59:56,281
And...

752
00:59:56,541 --> 00:59:58,333
this is your little mommy.

753
01:00:11,556 --> 01:00:14,723
This was in the mailbox.
It's for you.

754
01:00:28,073 --> 01:00:30,908
- Well...
- Yeah, I'm going. Don't worry.

755
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:32,656
I'm off.

756
01:00:43,964 --> 01:00:45,624
Jesus...

757
01:00:52,765 --> 01:00:53,796
What are you doing?

758
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:58,635
I'm walking you to the bus,
of course. We'll wave bye-bye.

759
01:01:00,648 --> 01:01:03,139
You send me to boarding school,
ruin my life,

760
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,398
and you want to "wave bye-bye?"

761
01:01:07,863 --> 01:01:10,568
The minute before I turn 18,
I'll call you,

762
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,776
and it'll be the last time
we ever talk!

763
01:01:13,578 --> 01:01:17,243
And those crumbs on your face
when you eat like a pig,

764
01:01:17,498 --> 01:01:19,040
your fucking Alzheimer's,

765
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:23,295
your revolting clothes
that make me want to barf,

766
01:01:23,754 --> 01:01:26,376
your ignorant
suburbanite expressions,

767
01:01:26,591 --> 01:01:30,042
your manipulation,
you can shove it up your ass!

768
01:01:36,601 --> 01:01:38,428
What would you do if I died today?

769
01:01:57,122 --> 01:01:58,948
I'd die tomorrow.

770
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:30,187
Dear Hubert,

771
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:36,778
"You're a fish from great depths:
blind and luminous."

772
01:02:37,496 --> 01:02:40,829
You're swimming in troubled waters
with the modern world's rage,

773
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:43,366
but with the frail poetry
of another era.

774
01:02:47,297 --> 01:02:49,788
After you left, my father called.
He said:

775
01:02:50,008 --> 01:02:52,334
"It's me.
I just wanted to hear from you."

776
01:02:53,262 --> 01:02:56,097
Ten years of silence,
ten seconds of sound.

777
01:02:56,306 --> 01:02:57,587
Life is absurd.

778
01:03:00,352 --> 01:03:03,187
I decided to visit a friend
in British Columbia.

779
01:03:03,397 --> 01:03:06,184
I don't know when I'll come back,
or if I will.

780
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:10,236
I'll never forget you.
Julie Cloutier XX

781
01:03:44,397 --> 01:03:47,682
Time's up.
Give me your tests now.

782
01:03:48,275 --> 01:03:50,149
Now or I'll take off points.

783
01:03:59,036 --> 01:04:00,234
I Killed My Mother

784
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,791
I bet most people believe

785
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,715
that hating your mother is a sin.

786
01:04:12,967 --> 01:04:14,592
They're hypocrites.

787
01:04:16,012 --> 01:04:18,088
They've all hated their mother.

788
01:04:20,433 --> 01:04:23,434
Maybe for a second,
maybe for a year.

789
01:04:23,895 --> 01:04:26,765
Maybe no longer, maybe they forgot.
I don't know.

790
01:04:26,981 --> 01:04:28,523
But it doesn't matter.

791
01:04:29,192 --> 01:04:30,686
They still have.

792
01:05:27,751 --> 01:05:29,210
What do you want?

793
01:05:29,419 --> 01:05:31,661
To become your friend.

794
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:35,130
And your bun, too.
If you don't want it, I do.

795
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:42,797
- I'm Hubert.
- Yeah, I know.

796
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:44,809
I'm Eric.

797
01:05:49,273 --> 01:05:50,471
Thanks.

798
01:05:55,362 --> 01:05:58,612
It's not that bad. You can wear
what you want at night.

799
01:06:05,289 --> 01:06:05,953
No, thanks.

800
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:07,999
Carcinogenic and fulvous.

801
01:06:10,002 --> 01:06:12,458
Flavorful and delicious.

802
01:06:17,718 --> 01:06:19,711
Why did you just turn up now?

803
01:06:21,555 --> 01:06:22,587
My mother.

804
01:06:23,391 --> 01:06:24,589
She hates me.

805
01:06:25,267 --> 01:06:27,141
What do you mean?

806
01:06:27,603 --> 01:06:29,512
She hates me. That's all.

807
01:06:30,106 --> 01:06:32,264
She's selfish and ruins my life.

808
01:06:32,942 --> 01:06:34,685
What's your life?

809
01:06:40,491 --> 01:06:42,365
I don't know. What's your life?

810
01:06:42,618 --> 01:06:43,816
My life...

811
01:06:44,328 --> 01:06:47,662
Well, it's not about having
a mother who hates me.

812
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:51,668
It's more about
not having a mother at all.

813
01:07:01,804 --> 01:07:03,678
Was that really awkward?

814
01:07:04,182 --> 01:07:05,759
Just a tad.

815
01:07:06,768 --> 01:07:08,345
Come on, let's go.

816
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:19,810
Sorry.

817
01:07:40,427 --> 01:07:43,344
We're going out tomorrow,
wanna come?

818
01:09:50,058 --> 01:09:52,727
Mom, sorry to wake you up,
my sweet mommy.

819
01:09:52,936 --> 01:09:54,216
- What's wrong?
- Mom!

820
01:09:54,604 --> 01:09:56,810
Did you have an accident?

821
01:09:57,273 --> 01:09:59,065
I'm so happy to see you.

822
01:09:59,275 --> 01:10:01,102
We have to talk. We have to talk.

823
01:10:01,736 --> 01:10:03,195
I want us to talk.

824
01:10:03,405 --> 01:10:03,985
What?

825
01:10:04,197 --> 01:10:06,355
I want us to talk.
I want us to talk.

826
01:10:06,574 --> 01:10:07,654
About what?

827
01:10:09,327 --> 01:10:11,997
I was in the subway,

828
01:10:12,205 --> 01:10:14,364
and I realized...

829
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:17,204
You know, we were traveling...

830
01:10:17,669 --> 01:10:20,125
I thought that
if I could put together

831
01:10:20,338 --> 01:10:23,173
each... little... thing

832
01:10:23,383 --> 01:10:27,712
that I want to tell you about
but that I never told you because...

833
01:10:27,929 --> 01:10:30,302
because I'm not that talkative.

834
01:10:30,515 --> 01:10:33,220
You know very well
that I'm not really

835
01:10:33,435 --> 01:10:35,558
a loquacious guy, right?

836
01:10:35,771 --> 01:10:40,349
But if I could put together
all the things I want to tell you,

837
01:10:40,567 --> 01:10:42,975
and tell you them in one go,

838
01:10:43,487 --> 01:10:44,862
it would take 100 years.

839
01:10:45,072 --> 01:10:49,401
One hundred fucking years
to tell you everything.

840
01:10:49,618 --> 01:10:53,201
And when I was in the subway,
I thought of you so much!

841
01:10:53,413 --> 01:10:57,032
I thought of you
with all the graffiti and colors...

842
01:10:57,876 --> 01:10:59,074
It was dirty.

843
01:10:59,294 --> 01:11:00,539
It was beautiful.

844
01:11:00,754 --> 01:11:03,459
It was so fucking beautiful!

845
01:11:03,674 --> 01:11:06,247
I was looking and then I thought:

846
01:11:06,468 --> 01:11:09,754
"We have to talk.
We absolutely have to talk!"

847
01:11:10,305 --> 01:11:12,097
Sometimes I hear you say:

848
01:11:12,308 --> 01:11:14,977
"We don't talk anymore.
We used to."

849
01:11:15,185 --> 01:11:18,389
That's what I think too!
That's what I think too!

850
01:11:20,983 --> 01:11:24,269
And then I think
that if I don't tell you now,

851
01:11:24,486 --> 01:11:26,812
if I don't tell you now,

852
01:11:27,031 --> 01:11:30,400
it'll torment me in my grave!

853
01:11:30,618 --> 01:11:33,868
lt'll follow me to the grave
and say...

854
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,614
A small voice will say:
"You should have told her! Hey!

855
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:39,458
"Enough is enough!

856
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:42,462
"You didn't tell her,
you didn't tell her!

857
01:11:43,172 --> 01:11:45,330
"You had to tell her
but you didn't!"

858
01:11:45,549 --> 01:11:46,664
- Hubert!
- Okay?

859
01:11:46,884 --> 01:11:48,295
What is it?

860
01:11:49,804 --> 01:11:51,713
Are you on drugs?

861
01:11:53,224 --> 01:11:55,513
Are you taking drugs at school?

862
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:57,057
Oh God!

863
01:11:57,478 --> 01:11:58,723
It's not a big deal.

864
01:11:59,772 --> 01:12:00,887
It's not a big deal!

865
01:12:01,107 --> 01:12:03,645
It's not a big deal.
What's important...

866
01:12:04,777 --> 01:12:06,106
What's important...

867
01:12:07,572 --> 01:12:09,315
is that we're together.

868
01:12:09,741 --> 01:12:10,939
Now!

869
01:12:12,076 --> 01:12:13,239
Do you understand?

870
01:12:13,453 --> 01:12:15,492
That's what matters, and the rest...

871
01:12:15,705 --> 01:12:17,579
We don't give a fuck.

872
01:12:17,999 --> 01:12:20,704
- We're good.
- Go drink a nice glass of milk.

873
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:23,410
- Because I feel good.
- You're all wet.

874
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,124
I feel so good!

875
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:28,089
I feel good. We're good.

876
01:12:28,301 --> 01:12:30,009
I love you so much!

877
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,963
So do I darling.

878
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:35,097
- I love you...
- I love you too.

879
01:12:35,308 --> 01:12:36,173
Now go to bed.

880
01:12:36,726 --> 01:12:40,309
Drink some milk,
it's an anti-poison.

881
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,018
You're laughing...

882
01:12:44,234 --> 01:12:46,310
I'm laughing because I'm happy!

883
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:49,108
I'm happy too...

884
01:12:49,322 --> 01:12:52,572
It's beddie-bye time now. It's late.

885
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,755
Well... thanks for the lift.

886
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:12,677
My pleasure, sweetheart.

887
01:13:14,931 --> 01:13:17,257
Where are you guys going to paint?

888
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:18,886
At Anto's mother's agency.

889
01:13:19,102 --> 01:13:22,602
We're going to do some dripping
like Jackson Pollock.

890
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:23,936
Jason... who?

891
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:26,225
"Jackson" Pollock.

892
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:32,275
Mom...

893
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:37,233
We talked a lot last night,
didn't we?

894
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,210
I just want...

895
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,125
I was on speed.

896
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,582
It's just that speed

897
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:52,959
makes you talk a lot.

898
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:56,380
I don't know what I said.

899
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:02,767
I don't want you to think that...

900
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:09,023
Have a nice day.

901
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:11,561
Mom...

902
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:17,901
Please find confirmation
of your child's enrollment

903
01:16:18,117 --> 01:16:21,201
at Our Lady of Sorrows
Boarding School for next year.

904
01:18:09,479 --> 01:18:11,057
Hello, sweetheart!

905
01:18:16,862 --> 01:18:18,142
Oh, my cake...

906
01:18:19,656 --> 01:18:21,649
I'm thrilled with my purchase!

907
01:18:22,409 --> 01:18:25,196
I found a dapper jacket
at Suzie Coquette's.

908
01:18:25,745 --> 01:18:27,026
It's so cute.

909
01:18:28,749 --> 01:18:31,868
It cost me 8 dollars,
but it's worth 40.

910
01:18:32,753 --> 01:18:34,461
Look how lovely it is.

911
01:18:35,464 --> 01:18:38,418
It's a Mario Fabuli
and it fits me like a glove.

912
01:18:39,051 --> 01:18:41,838
Look how cute it is.

913
01:18:42,054 --> 01:18:44,260
It'll go great with my grape pin!

914
01:18:44,723 --> 01:18:45,921
Tahdah!

915
01:18:46,808 --> 01:18:48,516
It fits me perfectly.

916
01:18:48,769 --> 01:18:49,718
Do you like it?

917
01:18:50,354 --> 01:18:51,729
It's cute, isn't?

918
01:18:52,189 --> 01:18:53,564
It's ugly.

919
01:18:56,068 --> 01:18:58,523
You're in a good mood!

920
01:18:58,904 --> 01:19:01,360
I'm pissed off
but I still have taste.

921
01:19:04,326 --> 01:19:07,446
Is your goal in life
for us to become enemies?

922
01:19:12,251 --> 01:19:14,706
- You enrolled me for next year?
- Listen.

923
01:19:15,504 --> 01:19:16,619
No, I won't listen.

924
01:19:16,839 --> 01:19:19,045
You're the one who needs to listen

925
01:19:19,258 --> 01:19:20,503
because I've had it!

926
01:19:22,595 --> 01:19:25,845
Maybe you think
I'll call you in 3 years

927
01:19:26,098 --> 01:19:29,799
to tell you how grateful I am
for boarding school,

928
01:19:30,019 --> 01:19:33,222
but if that's what you think,
you have it all wrong!

929
01:19:33,856 --> 01:19:34,852
Get it?

930
01:19:35,066 --> 01:19:37,272
What's gonna happen is...
when I leave,

931
01:19:37,526 --> 01:19:40,646
I'll cut off all ties
and I'll never speak to you again!

932
01:19:41,572 --> 01:19:43,481
Too bad,
I bought you filet mignon.

933
01:19:43,699 --> 01:19:46,369
I was going to make
your chive mashed potatoes.

934
01:19:46,577 --> 01:19:47,443
Lil' cake...

935
01:19:48,287 --> 01:19:49,450
Lovely evening in store.

936
01:19:51,958 --> 01:19:56,169
You think you can buy me
with filet mignon and a cake?

937
01:19:56,379 --> 01:19:57,956
Next time it'll be peanut butter!

938
01:19:58,172 --> 01:20:01,292
You're sending me
to a fucking boarding school

939
01:20:01,509 --> 01:20:04,047
where I'm far from
everything I love and know...

940
01:20:04,262 --> 01:20:06,800
And it's all because
you were incompetent!

941
01:20:07,014 --> 01:20:10,514
You didn't know how to be
a mother! You were too lenient.

942
01:20:10,727 --> 01:20:12,221
This is the result.
It's your fault!

943
01:20:12,437 --> 01:20:16,102
You won't have this problem.
You'll never have kids.

944
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:19,021
How do you know
I'll never have kids?

945
01:20:19,235 --> 01:20:22,272
Homosexuals don't have children.

946
01:20:24,824 --> 01:20:26,900
Anyway, I really enjoyed

947
01:20:27,118 --> 01:20:30,285
finding it out
from a complete stranger!

948
01:20:34,459 --> 01:20:37,662
"My boy and your boy,
two months already!"

949
01:20:37,879 --> 01:20:40,037
I said: "Wow, oh my God!"

950
01:20:40,256 --> 01:20:42,545
I was so happy to get the news.

951
01:20:43,426 --> 01:20:45,715
Who... who told you?

952
01:20:47,889 --> 01:20:50,214
Tell me who told you, please!

953
01:20:52,143 --> 01:20:54,183
Antonin's mother.

954
01:20:57,858 --> 01:21:00,527
He's your boyfriend,
and you know what?

955
01:21:01,695 --> 01:21:04,268
What hurts the most
is that you didn't tell me...

956
01:21:04,489 --> 01:21:07,656
that you don't trust me and
don't know how much I love you.

957
01:21:07,868 --> 01:21:10,572
I don't want to hear that!
I'm sorry...

958
01:21:10,787 --> 01:21:14,488
If you loved me, you wouldn't
send me away. You love me badly!

959
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:17,246
You don't know how to love me!
Stop loving me!

960
01:21:17,461 --> 01:21:18,623
Let me go!

961
01:21:21,965 --> 01:21:25,714
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
- Don't touch me. Enough already.

962
01:21:25,928 --> 01:21:27,303
Enough already.

963
01:21:28,597 --> 01:21:30,221
- I'm sorry...
- No.

964
01:21:31,016 --> 01:21:33,222
Go to Antonin's.

965
01:21:33,435 --> 01:21:37,599
Eat over there and ask them
to drive you to the bus because...

966
01:21:40,109 --> 01:21:42,315
I won't be able to tonight.

967
01:21:44,571 --> 01:21:47,109
- I didn't want to hurt you.
- Enough.

968
01:21:49,284 --> 01:21:50,862
It's fine, Hubert.

969
01:22:04,425 --> 01:22:07,177
I'm off to New York tomorrow.
Can't wait.

970
01:22:07,678 --> 01:22:09,718
Too bad you have to study

971
01:22:09,972 --> 01:22:14,266
to be financially independent
otherwise you could've come with me.

972
01:22:14,477 --> 01:22:15,675
Bite me.

973
01:22:16,395 --> 01:22:17,225
And you, Hub?

974
01:22:17,938 --> 01:22:19,730
How's boarding school going?

975
01:22:24,111 --> 01:22:25,356
What tact! Well done.

976
01:22:25,613 --> 01:22:26,692
What?

977
01:22:27,406 --> 01:22:29,446
Is it that terrible?

978
01:22:33,037 --> 01:22:35,243
If it's really that bad at home,

979
01:22:35,498 --> 01:22:37,787
you can stay here on weekends.

980
01:22:39,544 --> 01:22:42,829
But your mother loves you
just the way you are?

981
01:22:43,047 --> 01:22:46,748
I mean, she loves
you unconditionally. Doesn't she?

982
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:52,384
You told her about Anto and you,
didn't you?

983
01:22:57,645 --> 01:22:58,641
No.

984
01:23:01,774 --> 01:23:03,019
Dessert?

985
01:23:03,234 --> 01:23:04,812
Strawberry angel food!

986
01:23:07,864 --> 01:23:09,773
Bipolarity, may I help you?

987
01:23:58,290 --> 01:24:00,117
Crappy crap.

988
01:24:05,839 --> 01:24:07,250
"Full batt."

989
01:24:14,348 --> 01:24:16,637
When I say it, I mean it.

990
01:24:17,851 --> 01:24:21,434
Deep down, I love her,
but it's not the love of a son.

991
01:24:22,773 --> 01:24:24,018
It's strange...

992
01:24:24,775 --> 01:24:26,649
if someone hurt her,

993
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:27,940
I'd kill him.

994
01:24:29,071 --> 01:24:30,565
And yet,

995
01:24:31,115 --> 01:24:34,531
I can think of a hundred people
I love more than my mom.

996
01:24:34,743 --> 01:24:37,413
It's a paradox having a mother

997
01:24:37,621 --> 01:24:39,530
that you're incapable of loving

998
01:24:40,291 --> 01:24:42,746
but incapable not to love.

999
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:53,925
The only thing to kill
in this lifetime

1000
01:24:54,138 --> 01:24:56,510
is the enemy within,
the hard core double.

1001
01:24:56,724 --> 01:24:59,132
Dominating him is an art.

1002
01:24:59,352 --> 01:25:00,846
How good an artist are we?

1003
01:26:39,661 --> 01:26:40,491
Dear Hubert,

1004
01:26:40,704 --> 01:26:45,165
My friend and I rented bikes to ride
from Vancouver to San Francisco.

1005
01:26:45,375 --> 01:26:49,207
Wind in our hair, iridescent
twilight, cheap motels. Bliss.

1006
01:26:49,421 --> 01:26:52,837
How are you? Boarding school?
Your mother? Julie XX

1007
01:29:26,079 --> 01:29:28,405
- Accounting, hello?
- Mrs. Lemming?

1008
01:29:28,624 --> 01:29:29,703
Speaking.

1009
01:29:30,751 --> 01:29:34,286
Principal Nadeau, Our Lady
of Sorrows Boarding School.

1010
01:29:35,339 --> 01:29:37,664
I don't know how to say this but...

1011
01:29:37,883 --> 01:29:40,172
Your son, Hubert, he...

1012
01:29:41,136 --> 01:29:41,883
He ran away.

1013
01:29:42,763 --> 01:29:43,759
Excuse me?

1014
01:29:44,473 --> 01:29:48,601
He was present at breakfast,
but was missing during roll call...

1015
01:29:48,936 --> 01:29:51,308
We looked everywhere
and then found

1016
01:29:51,522 --> 01:29:54,855
a letter addressed to you
in his room.

1017
01:29:55,568 --> 01:29:58,319
Since we thought
he might be in danger...

1018
01:29:58,696 --> 01:30:00,320
we read it.

1019
01:30:01,073 --> 01:30:02,781
What does it say?

1020
01:30:02,992 --> 01:30:04,023
It says:

1021
01:30:05,327 --> 01:30:08,613
"I'll be in my kingdom
if you want to talk to me."

1022
01:30:13,044 --> 01:30:15,795
Do you know
where "his kingdom" is?

1023
01:30:16,964 --> 01:30:20,001
Yes, it's in Montmagny.
I better hang up now.

1024
01:30:20,801 --> 01:30:25,298
Mrs. Lemming, we'd appreciate it
if you'd call when you hear from him.

1025
01:30:26,474 --> 01:30:27,885
You know...

1026
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:31,719
We've never had a run-away
situation here before.

1027
01:30:32,522 --> 01:30:35,191
But there's a first for everything!

1028
01:30:37,819 --> 01:30:40,570
If I may, Mrs. Lemming,

1029
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:43,235
from what I could observe,

1030
01:30:44,534 --> 01:30:47,653
it seems your son...
I know you're a single-mother.

1031
01:30:47,870 --> 01:30:52,414
Don't you think he'd benefit
from a male presence at home?

1032
01:30:52,667 --> 01:30:55,372
A little male authority
might do him good.

1033
01:30:56,045 --> 01:30:57,208
Don't you agree?

1034
01:30:57,922 --> 01:31:00,627
That's the damn limit,
you arrogant individual.

1035
01:31:00,842 --> 01:31:02,751
Who the fuck do you think you are?

1036
01:31:02,969 --> 01:31:04,878
Do you teach "Mothering 101"?

1037
01:31:05,555 --> 01:31:09,303
My manic-depressive mother
spent half her life in the hospital.

1038
01:31:09,517 --> 01:31:13,764
I married a coward who left because
fathering wasn't his cup of tea.

1039
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:17,349
Fifteen years I've been waking up
at 5:30 to get to work

1040
01:31:17,567 --> 01:31:21,896
and drive through goddamn traffic
so my son can eat and go to school!

1041
01:31:22,113 --> 01:31:23,608
- Mrs. Lemming.
- Shut the fuck up!

1042
01:31:23,823 --> 01:31:25,567
Goddamn stupid-ass machos!

1043
01:31:25,784 --> 01:31:27,860
You're always quick to judge us

1044
01:31:28,078 --> 01:31:31,281
as you strut around
in your goddamn Bugs Bunny ties!

1045
01:31:31,498 --> 01:31:34,415
You throw your red underwear
in with the whites!

1046
01:31:34,626 --> 01:31:36,915
Do you like pink socks,
motherfucker?

1047
01:31:37,128 --> 01:31:38,706
So don't try to tell me

1048
01:31:38,922 --> 01:31:42,006
that my son ran away
because I'm a single-mother!

1049
01:31:42,217 --> 01:31:44,625
You all have 150 IQs and you, you...

1050
01:31:44,845 --> 01:31:50,052
You auto-congratulate yourselves
with your endless diplomas,

1051
01:31:50,267 --> 01:31:53,683
and when a 17-year-old escapes
from your establishment

1052
01:31:53,895 --> 01:31:56,565
you dare tell me
that I'm a bad mother?

1053
01:31:56,773 --> 01:32:00,641
You persecute me with your
questions and petty insinuations.

1054
01:32:01,904 --> 01:32:04,229
You project
your incompetence on me!

1055
01:32:04,448 --> 01:32:06,737
Go fuck yourself,
you son of a bitch!

1056
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:11,114
And if I don't find a reimbursement
in my mailbox by next week,

1057
01:32:11,330 --> 01:32:14,995
I'll come and make you cough up
every last penny!

1058
01:32:15,209 --> 01:32:17,248
Have I made myself clear?

1059
01:32:46,949 --> 01:32:49,357
Did you remember to bring
my clothes?

1060
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:54,110
Thank you.

1061
01:33:01,631 --> 01:33:02,745
Thanks.

1062
01:33:07,553 --> 01:33:11,931
I figured it wouldn't be a big deal
for you to miss a day of school.

1063
01:33:12,141 --> 01:33:14,264
With your grades and all...

1064
01:33:15,937 --> 01:33:18,688
I also knew your mom left
you her car.

1065
01:33:20,983 --> 01:33:23,984
Yes, Hubert,
that's what you figured because...

1066
01:33:25,571 --> 01:33:28,407
I'm just your maid,
your whore, is that it?

1067
01:33:28,616 --> 01:33:31,190
You don't give a fuck
that I might get in trouble.

1068
01:33:33,955 --> 01:33:37,288
What's your mom going to do?
Take me to court?

1069
01:33:38,084 --> 01:33:40,705
Grow up, dammit! You're so selfish!

1070
01:33:43,548 --> 01:33:46,253
Stop looking at me
with those puppy eyes!

1071
01:33:49,095 --> 01:33:53,757
I don't feel sorry for you just
because you fell down the stairs.

1072
01:34:01,983 --> 01:34:03,098
I love you.

1073
01:35:16,934 --> 01:35:17,598
Antonin?

1074
01:35:19,854 --> 01:35:20,684
Chantal.

1075
01:35:22,523 --> 01:35:23,851
I've heard a lot about you.

1076
01:35:24,859 --> 01:35:26,187
Doesn't surprise me.

1077
01:35:32,116 --> 01:35:34,737
You lived here
when Hubert was little?

1078
01:35:34,952 --> 01:35:35,699
Yes.

1079
01:35:35,911 --> 01:35:37,987
We moved to the city
after the divorce.

1080
01:35:38,247 --> 01:35:40,204
It belongs to his father now.

1081
01:35:41,709 --> 01:35:43,702
Where is Hubert? On the rocks?

1082
01:35:44,712 --> 01:35:45,625
Yes.

1083
01:39:46,626 --> 01:39:50,026
