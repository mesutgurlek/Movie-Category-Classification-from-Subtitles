1
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,151
And one.

2
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,713
Heel forward.

3
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,955
Good.

4
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,950
That's right. Shoulders down.

5
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,189
And brush.

6
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,993
- Do you know how many they take?
- Usually no more than 12.

7
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,038
- Twelve? Out of this class?
- Out of the whole planet.

8
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,156
In the middle. Number 15.

9
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,800
Not enough turnout. Bad feet.

10
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,431
But look at her.

11
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,994
- Excuse me!
- You're excused.

12
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,275
Here we go.

13
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,555
Am I a bad mother
if I hope she doesn't get it?

14
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,313
Don't ask me.
I was against this from the start.

15
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,152
- Mom!
- Jody!

16
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,838
Mom, I got in!

17
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,317
- I made it.
- Wonderful, honey.

18
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,672
Can you believe it? I'm gonna New York.

19
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,553
Hey, what happened?

20
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,559
- They didn't take you?
- No.

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,437
No? Those bastards.

22
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,159
Not, "No, they didn't".
No, they did.

23
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,199
Do you know who went there?
Everyone who matters in American ballet.

24
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,055
The school feeds right into the company.

25
00:02:15,117 --> 00:02:18,836
Yeah. But there's no guarantee
you'll make the company, right?

26
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,474
And you could still dance in college, honey.

27
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,994
Indiana has a great dance program.

28
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,021
Hey, this is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

29
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:30,357
I don't think it would kill you
to at least pretend to be happy.

30
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,718
It's a scholarship. They give'em to everybody.
That's the only way they can get people to go.

31
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:37,664
- When are you gonna start?
- I don't know. I'm thinking I may not gonna go.

32
00:02:37,902 --> 00:02:40,863
What are you taking about?
What are you gonna do instead?

33
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:42,625
There's a new Hooters open I could work there.

34
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:44,838
- As what?
- You do not have the rack.

35
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,995
I'll get implants!

36
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,111
- Need a hand?
- No.

37
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:35,048
No.

38
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,515
- No?
- I mean, no, thank you.

39
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,309
Okay.

40
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,669
Idiot.

41
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:24,346
Hi.

42
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:26,558
I'm Eva Rodriguez. How you doing?

43
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,981
- Jody Sawyer. Fine. I'm new here.
- Oh, me too. I took the top.

44
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,833
This is good.

45
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,310
- You know who I saw on my way in?
- Who?

46
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,913
Cooper Nielson.

47
00:04:37,307 --> 00:04:40,663
Oh, yeah?
Did he seem as cocky in person as he is on TV?

48
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,153
You know, it just kinda freaks me out that we're gonna be seeing people like him around all the time now.

49
00:04:45,232 --> 00:04:46,745
You'll get used to it.

50
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,105
I'm Maureen. I guess I'm living with you.

51
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,151
Don't sound so excited.

52
00:04:55,202 --> 00:04:56,681
I'm Jody.

53
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,315
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- This is Eva.

54
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,793
Whadda you doing?

55
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,837
I'm knitting a sweater.

56
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,813
If you wanna smoke,
you have to go outside.

57
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:12,017
Fine. I'll go outside. Are you coming?

58
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,239
- Bye, Maureen.
- Bye.

59
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,796
- Hey, Eric Jones.
- How you doing, Eric?

60
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,589
My stage name is Eric O. Jones,
after Oprah. She's my idol.

61
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,311
Eva Rodriguez, after no one.

62
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,311
Oh, an individual. I like it.

63
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,711
I'm Jody Sawyer.

64
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,869
Well, We were just going around to smoke.
Do you wanna joing us?

65
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:34,634
Oh, come downstairs.
It's Marlboro Country.

66
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,595
- So, Serge...
- Sergei, Sergei.

67
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,994
Who's the babe?

68
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,714
- It's my girlfriend, Galina.
- Oh, God! Don't get him started.

69
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,429
She was here all four years with me
and now dances with San Francisco Ballet.

70
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,750
- You've been here for four years already?
- Yeah.

71
00:05:47,808 --> 00:05:50,119
So you know the story with this Maureen chick
we're living with, huh?

72
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,065
You're living with Maureen?

73
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,589
- Well, good luck.
- Big-time bitch?

74
00:05:54,823 --> 00:05:58,555
Biggest time. And of course,
she has the best technique in the school.

75
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,370
She's been here since she was nine.

76
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,432
Is this the right room?

77
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,038
(If) it's not, I'm staying anyways.

78
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,712
No argument here, baby.

79
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,519
- You're Charlie? Then you're in the right place.
- Excellent.

80
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,798
That's Sergei, that's Jody, that's Eva,
I'm Eric, and you're cute.

81
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:16,717
- Long trip?
- From Seattle.

82
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,154
My girlfriend dumped me
for leaving her there.

83
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,077
Morning.

84
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,872
Would the new students
raise your hands, please?

85
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:50,438
And which of you was the best dancer
in the last class he or she took?

86
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,869
Come on.

87
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,519
It's a heady thing, isn't it?
Being the best.

88
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,694
Teachers dote on you.
Other students ask for your help.

89
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,879
And an aura builds
and then you get accepted into ABA.

90
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,632
And whether or not you admit it,
you start thinking...

91
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,111
...that's just a matter of time before you're doing <i>Giselle</i>
before packed houses at Lincoln Center.

92
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,114
For most of you, that will never happen.

93
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,232
I don't say this to be cruel. I say it to help you clarify
your expectations for the year ahead.

94
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,430
If you work harder every day
than you've ever worked in your life...

95
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,308
...this school will turn you into
the best dancer you can possibly be.

96
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,232
That may or may not be the kind of dancer
I've room for in the company.

97
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,077
At best, I can take
three boys and three girls.

98
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:46,675
I'll be watching you carefully
over the coming months.

99
00:08:46,815 --> 00:08:50,762
But I won't be making any decisions until I see
how you dance in the workshop performance...

100
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,752
...at the end of the year.

101
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:57,306
They won't be easy decisions to make,
because you're all very talented.

102
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:59,750
You wouldn't be here if you weren't.

103
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,718
Thank you for bringing your gifts
to our community.

104
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,109
I wish you all a very good year.

105
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,353
I hope he doesn't think that was inspirational.

106
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,589
Oh, one more thing.

107
00:09:09,688 --> 00:09:13,442
Next week's the company gala. We always invite
advanced students to attend the performance,

108
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,479
and to help out at the party afterwards.
I expect you all to be there.

109
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,236
- And you are?
- Eva Rodriguez.

110
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,739
So glad you could fit us
into your busy schedule, Eva.

111
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,553
Oh, no sweat.

112
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:33,837
All right, ladies, we'll start with our pli閟.

113
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:39,198
First position. Demi and stretch.
Demi and stretch.

114
00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:42,434
Full grand plié. And return.

115
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,598
Port de bras forward.

116
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,712
Full port de bras back.

117
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,598
The same in second,
fourth and fifth positions...

118
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,598
...and then we'll rise
and take a balance in fifth.

119
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,588
Yes? Let's begin. Steven?

120
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,911
Relax those fingers, Janie.

121
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:09,543
Very nice, Maureen.

122
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,429
Pull those ribs in. Really support.

123
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,796
Nice long lines, ladies.

124
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,274
Put the energy coming up over your heads.

125
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,674
- What's your name, dear?
- Jody Sawyer.

126
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,629
You need to concentrate on your turnout.

127
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,953
From the hip.

128
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:49,309
We have a dress code here.

129
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:52,452
Black leotard, pink tights.

130
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,009
Stylish.

131
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:58,205
No gum.

132
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,831
Get your hair off your face.

133
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,682
Développé écarté,

134
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,834
Change to effacé.

135
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,795
Plié, Tendu. Lift the leg, first arabesque.

136
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,116
Maureen, will you show us, please?

137
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,277
Now, look at Maureen's arms.

138
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,471
They're perfectly supported
from underneath, not above.

139
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,271
Not wilting at her sides
like dead chicken wings.

140
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:47,558
Oh, she's so good.

141
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,438
Yeah, just ask her.

142
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,753
And one.

143
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,990
Really extend that front leg. Yes.

144
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,278
Ready, second group.

145
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,078
Where'd she come from?

146
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,595
Softer landing, ladies, please.

147
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,592
Anna, eyes off the mirror, please.
Thank you.

148
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,834
Watch where you're going, sweetheart.
We don't carry collision insurance.

149
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,311
Who let that disaster in here?

150
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,021
I swear I'm better than that.
I'm just really nervous.

151
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:26,950
Hey, don't sweat it.
First day never counts. Okay?

152
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,951
Everything counts here.

153
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,033
One and hip.

154
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,398
Fresh meat.

155
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,313
In the middle.

156
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,951
- And one. Good. Not bad.
- Cute. Who is he?

157
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,318
Charlie, from Seattle.

158
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,356
We only met him yesterday.

159
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,838
Is he gay or straight?

160
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,354
Straight.

161
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,477
Hey, you guys. Look.

162
00:12:57,969 --> 00:12:59,368
Hi, girls.

163
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,439
Maureen, Anna.

164
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,193
Hi, Kathleen.

165
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,074
- That was Kathleen Donahue, wasn't it?
- Yep.

166
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,037
The Kathleen Donahue.

167
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,390
Oh, my God. She's beautiful.

168
00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:15,639
Well, I think she looks kinda like a gerbil.

169
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,590
What?

170
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,766
She does.

171
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,111
Is she just married Mr. Reeves, right?

172
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,433
What? Wait a minute.
She married the director?

173
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,310
- Now I get it.
- Yeah. This summer. It was a huge scandal.

174
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,228
She'd been with Cooper for a few years.

175
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:32,139
And then one day, out of nowhere she tells him
she's leaving him for Jonathan Reeves.

176
00:13:32,273 --> 00:13:33,991
No one even knew they were having an affair.

177
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,113
And Cooper throws this huge fit in rehearsal
in front of the whole company. Calls her a slut and stuff.

178
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,713
It was unbelievable.

179
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,952
Then he drags his broken heart off
to London to dance for the season.

180
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,736
Where rumor has it, he drinks like a fish
and screws every girl in tights.

181
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,316
- He's back, you know.
- I know.

182
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,231
I heard he hasn't spoken to anyone.

183
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:52,680
No, he talked to me.

184
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:53,688
What?

185
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,868
You know, he offered to help me with my bags.

186
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,989
Bob, it's a benefit.

187
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,038
If I give you an extra seat,
I'm taking money away from the company.

188
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,085
Besides, when was the last time
your paper ran anything on us?

189
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:14,752
Oh, what the hell. Three seats under your name at will call,
but only because I'm nice.

190
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,551
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

191
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,990
- Well?
- Nothing to worry about.

192
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,715
So, what's the competition?
What about your roommates?

193
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,030
Jody's hopeless.
She'll never make it.

194
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,078
- Is she the one from Boston?
- No, that's Eva.

195
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,035
Eva's actually good. Amazing extension.

196
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,875
But her attitude stinks.
Jonathan hates her already, thank God.

197
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,394
So you still think it'll be you,
Anna and Emily?

198
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,653
Yeah. Although,
have you seen Emily lately?

199
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,434
Look at her.

200
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,679
Hello, Emily.

201
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,473
Hi, Mrs. Cummings.

202
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,228
Dear.

203
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,558
Her pas de deux partner's
gonna to need a crane to lift her.

204
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,595
Oh, you stop.

205
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,355
No way do people actually buy this shit.

206
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,876
- It's signed by Kathleen Donahue.
- It's a smelly old shoe.

207
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:00,023
Cooper!

208
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:03,240
- How you been?
- Can I tear you away for a minute?

209
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,748
There's a woman here who's husband just died,
leaving her $200 million, and she adores you.

210
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,553
- Excuse me. That was beautiful.
- Let me introduce you.

211
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,392
Now, why does that feel wrong?

212
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,618
Oh, it's just a hello.
It'd be great for the company.

213
00:19:14,746 --> 00:19:15,753
-Jonathan.
-Steve.

214
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,358
Well, if it's good for the company.
I mean, you know me. Team player.

215
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,156
Joan Miller.
Cooper Nielson.

216
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,816
- Hello.
- Well, this is an honor. Cooper,

217
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,919
I am, without a doubt, your biggest fan.

218
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,473
And my loveliest.

219
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,599
Now, what on earth were you doing
way over there in dreary London...

220
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,910
...when everyone loves you so much here?

221
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:44,606
Don't you listen to the gossip?
I was being huffy. Scorned lover. All that.

222
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,072
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
- Not at all. It's fine.

223
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,034
Joan, this is one
of our advanced students...

224
00:19:54,307 --> 00:19:56,059
- Jody Sawyer.
- Sorry.

225
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,596
We have so many promising students this year,
I find it hard to keep'em straight.

226
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,831
You see?
That's how taxing Jonathan's job is.

227
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,955
There's so much is going on, he can't remember
the name of a beautiful girl.

228
00:20:07,912 --> 00:20:09,903
Don't worry, Jody Sawyer.

229
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,033
I don't run a company.

230
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,473
I won't forget.

231
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,914
Excuse me.

232
00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:21,306
I will trade you one bliss potato
with caviar for one of your tiaras.

233
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,719
My old one's broken and I'm desperate.

234
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,277
What will you use it for?

235
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,633
You know, state funerals,
abdications, the usual.

236
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:34,122
I'll see if we have your size.

237
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,933
Hey, you guys, wanna see something?
Come on, just go with this.

238
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,120
Oh, Cooper, I've already told Kathleen,
but, what a treat, that <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

239
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,039
You're the finest Romeo
since Jonathan himself.

240
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,873
- It's a great piece.
- And you two together.

241
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,792
I don't do anything.

242
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,553
It's all her.

243
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,559
Come on.

244
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,631
Save it for the workshop, Charlie.

245
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,711
- Look at him.
- Get over here.

246
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,031
- Let's show them.
- Sure.

247
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,199
- What's wrong with you?
- You know exactly what you did.

248
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,421
You've got no right to paw me
in front of all those people.

249
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:33,425
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wasn't pawing you.

250
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:34,797
I mean, I can't even touch you?

251
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,558
We're not friends anymore?

252
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,073
Okay, Cooper, listen.

253
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,025
I think it's great you're back.
You're a wonderful dancer.

254
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:44,241
But I am just as happily married
as I was before you left.

255
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:47,760
Yeah, were things so good at home,
how come we danced better tonight than we ever have?

256
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,394
(For) God's sake, Cooper, that was acting!

257
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,153
Pretending.

258
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,993
That's our job.

259
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,592
I got to get back.

260
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,433
- My God.
- I know.

261
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,152
In the grandest scheme of things,
it was a pretty cool night.

262
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,471
Yeah, except for that slave-labor part,
it didn't suck.

263
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,910
'Scuse me. Coming through.

264
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,835
No luck, huh?

265
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,598
- What?
- The tiara.

266
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,156
She went off to find one in my size.

267
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,434
Oh, no. No luck!

268
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,551
That's all right.
I'm sure you tried your hardest.

269
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,074
- Anyone want a fruit tart for the road?
- Yeah, I'll take one.

270
00:22:34,263 --> 00:22:37,303
- It's practically all fat, Emily.
- Hello, Emily. I'm Jim Gordon.

271
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:38,221
Hi.

272
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,834
So you guys like, work here?

273
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,718
Oh, no. We're students
at the American Ballet Academy.

274
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,438
Ballerinas. Very cool.

275
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,671
Oh, my God.
You got to try one of these, Maureen.

276
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,831
Well, she has a name. Maureen.

277
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,115
We have to go.

278
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,348
Yeah. Me, too.

279
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,228
I'm gonna go home, call my mom.
Tell her how wrong I've been about New York.

280
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,756
You see, Maureen No-Last-Name,
all this time I've been telling her,

281
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,913
"It's an interesting city,
but completely devoid of any true, natural beauty."

282
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,357
And now that I've met you,

283
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,680
I know that's not true.

284
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,479
- Cummings.
- What?

285
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,030
Her last name.
It's Cummings.

286
00:23:16,488 --> 00:23:19,670
Go. And one and stretch and stretch.

287
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:22,155
Good lift. And, good, Charlie! Yes.

288
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,079
Stretch that front foot. Much better.
Yes! Good. One. Go.

289
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,357
Take it forward.
That's it. Good. Dip and go.

290
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,317
All right. I'm here. Sorry.

291
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,957
I know. I'm sorry.

292
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,669
And one.
(The) arms lifted here.

293
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,598
(The) head is here. Yes.

294
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,236
Lift through here, lift,
but not tucked, dear.

295
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,919
Ready, Maureen?

296
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,557
Beautiful rond brisé.

297
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,758
Feet always stretched.

298
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,190
Look at how lovely her arms are.

299
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,398
Head up, Stephanie.

300
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,792
Everyone, ribs in.

301
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,476
Don't let your elbows droop.

302
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,439
Turnout, Jody.

303
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,033
From the hips, dear.

304
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,239
Well, now really Just skim the surface this time, ladies.

305
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,074
Jody, flutter.

306
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,794
Yes, Eva.

307
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,908
Exactly.

308
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,590
- You feel the difference?
- Felt like the same old shit to me.

309
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,110
Late out of that turn, Jody.
You're trying too hard.

310
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,479
Thank you, ladies.

311
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,909
Emily.

312
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,958
You might wanna visit the nutritionist this week.
She can give you some good pointers.

313
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,279
Go back. Go back.
Come on. Let's go. Go back.

314
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,353
I need to see the girls
gesture to their partners.

315
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,590
"Hello, I'm waiting."

316
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,069
And the boys rush over and kneel.

317
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,312
"I am your slave."

318
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,670
And...

319
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,512
I am your slave.

320
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,397
I'd believe it more if you weren't staring at
your fucking reflection when you said it.

321
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,075
If someone wants to hear profanity,
Miss Rodriguez, they can take a subway.

322
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,913
They don't need to spend $60
on a ballet ticket.

323
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:01,317
Though she has a point.

324
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,552
That foot, my dear. Let's go back.
Come on. Try it again.

325
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,438
You've got to work with me here, Jody.

326
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:14,231
Okay?

327
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,633
Lift, Anna.

328
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,073
Excellent, Eva.

329
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,791
Where's the turnout, Jody?

330
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,357
After everything we've talked about,
I'm not seeing it.

331
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,117
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Use what you have and turn out.

332
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,350
Jesus! She heard you!

333
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,274
Excuse me?

334
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,638
She heard you. We all heard you!
You don't have to speak to her like that!

335
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,713
- Anyone can see she's working her ass off!
- That's enough, Miss Rodriguez.

336
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,958
This is my classroom.

337
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,595
And I will run it as I see fit.

338
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,270
If you have a problem with that,
you are free to leave.

339
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,872
Oh, Maureen, if you wanna get calls,
please do so in the dorm.

340
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,076
- Don't give out this number.
- I didn't.

341
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,472
Well, a Jim Gordon got it somehow
and has been calling for you non-stop.

342
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,199
Hi. Whadda you doing here?

343
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,948
Nothing.

344
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,950
I'm just waiting.

345
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,026
I know. I wasn't myself today.

346
00:28:15,052 --> 00:28:17,887
I didn't get enough sleep last night,
So I was really tired.

347
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,757
It's not just today, Jody.

348
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,145
I see you three times a week.

349
00:28:23,806 --> 00:28:24,865
You're not improving.

350
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,217
- I can work harder.
- Oh, no matter how hard you work...

351
00:28:28,711 --> 00:28:32,032
...there are certain realities about you
as a dancer that we have to face.

352
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,174
We can wait till the end of the year when it's time to get a job,
but we can talk about it now...

353
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,510
...while you still have options.

354
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:44,944
You're not very turned out.

355
00:28:45,466 --> 00:28:46,927
So that needs work.

356
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,556
And you don't have great feet.

357
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,396
And while you're very pretty...

358
00:28:57,522 --> 00:28:59,513
...you don't have the ideal body type.

359
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,677
Margot Fonteyn didn't have great feet.

360
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,599
When Fonteyn was onstage,
you couldn't tear your eyes away from her.

361
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,763
It can't be taught.

362
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,915
In four months, we're gonna put on
a workshop in front of 3,000 people.

363
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,709
It's an audition for every major
ballet company in the country.

364
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,283
From what I've seen,
I can't cast you in that workshop.

365
00:29:24,087 --> 00:29:28,080
And if you're not onstage that day,
you won't get a job, not at ABC, not anywhere.

366
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,230
So, what?
Are you kicking me out?

367
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,715
No.

368
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,995
I just want you to really think...

369
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,549
...if this is the right place for you.

370
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,389
What a prick!

371
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,913
He was perfectly nice about it.

372
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,197
Yeah, but being nice when you say
something pricky is even prickier.

373
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,879
What if he's right?

374
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,915
What?

375
00:29:53,537 --> 00:29:57,132
Let's be honest.
You're not like most of the girls here.

376
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,818
Your technique is nowhere near
where it should be.

377
00:29:59,844 --> 00:30:03,391
Hey, news flash: There's more to
being a great dancer than perfect technique.

378
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,517
- Try dancing <i>Swan Lake</i> without it.
- Oh, God! I can't believe I'm hearing this?

379
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,272
Look, you're really smart.

380
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,557
If you send in your application now,
you could get into a good college.

381
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,359
I don't wanna go to college.
I wanna dance.

382
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:16,560
Yeah, so do a lot of people.

383
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,712
Jesus! What? You went to a special
bitch academy or something?

384
00:30:19,814 --> 00:30:20,882
I'm just trying to be honest.

385
00:30:20,908 --> 00:30:23,514
In my opinion, that's what friends do,
to tell each other the truth.

386
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,438
I guess that explains
why you have so many friends.

387
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,755
If anyone asks, I'm in the library.

388
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,949
Truth?

389
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,079
In terms of technique, you are behind.

390
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,640
But the people here
know what they're looking for.

391
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,757
And on the day of your audition,
they saw it in you.

392
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,638
Yeah, and now all they see is
the wrong body type.

393
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,195
Eva, why can't I have your feet?

394
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,558
- Okay. Enough of this. Get up.
- Why?

395
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,916
Because all we ever do in this place
is take class.

396
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,029
It's about time we had a little fun.

397
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,235
Hi, Maureen.

398
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,356
Hi, Emily. How you guys doing?

399
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,316
Fine.

400
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,515
Good.

401
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,435
So has Maureen been really busy?

402
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,028
I mean, she isn't seeing someone else, like...

403
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,832
...Cooper Nielson or someone?

404
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,563
What do you know about Cooper Nielson?

405
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:32,998
Hey, I've been doing my ballet research.

406
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,548
We're not encouraged
to date company members.

407
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,631
I fully support that policy.

408
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,155
Look.

409
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,834
All I came here to say is
I go to Columbia, pre-Med.

410
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,633
I have a clean record, impeccable hygiene
and here's my number.

411
00:31:56,727 --> 00:31:58,922
- Go talk to him.
- Come on, go.

412
00:31:58,985 --> 00:31:59,516
Hey!

413
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,003
The thing is, I've
got priorities.

414
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:06,256
I mean, you only get to be a
dancer for 10 years.

415
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,250
Maybe 15 if you don't get injured.
So, for the next decade at least...

416
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:10,959
Hey, all I'm asking for is a date.

417
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,070
OMG!

418
00:32:21,183 --> 00:32:22,676
That's why I like this guy.

419
00:32:22,864 --> 00:32:26,516
Ok. Anna's for sure, right?
She's always been Jonathan's favorite.

420
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,033
- Maureen, too.
- Oh yeah, you're right.

421
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,998
- Boring.
- Boring or not, Jonathan likes her.

422
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,957
Yeah. That only leaves one girl spot open.

423
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,758
- Emily will get it.
- I don't think so.

424
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,436
- She's getting big. Jonathan hates big.
- Oh, no. It's a little extra padding for the winter.

425
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,910
You didn't get all done up like that
to talk about ballet.

426
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,348
Come on.

427
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,552
- What does she have that I don't?
- She can salsa.

428
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,673
You call that salsa? Come on, Eric.
We'll show them salsa.

429
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,392
Get your asses up here.

430
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,311
- What is that?
- That's not salsa.

431
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,834
- That is not salsa.
- Use the technique, Charlie.

432
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,558
Here we go, girl.

433
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,994
Hi.

434
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,432
Where are you from?

435
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,352
- Jersey.
- New Jersey?

436
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,358
Me. I'm from Russia.

437
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,351
Yeah? What are you doing here?

438
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,192
I'm a ballet dancer.

439
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,316
So, how do I do this exactly?

440
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,833
You've never bowled before?

441
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,670
No.

442
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,155
Just roll it on down there.

443
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,396
In Nepal, there's a this jungle, when this elephant's walking down the way, he steps on a thorn.

444
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,993
He says, "OMG, That hurts."

445
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,959
He sees a little mouse, he goes,
"Oh, Mouse, could you help me out get the thorn out of my foot. It really hurts."

446
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,158
And the mouse goes, "No, no. You stepped on
my uncle last week. I remember you. Forget about it. Buddy, No way."

447
00:34:41,184 --> 00:34:43,800
Then he goes, "Please, come on, I'll do anything.
It really hurts."

448
00:34:43,871 --> 00:34:45,503
- So the mouse goes, "Anything? "
- He says, "Yeah."

449
00:34:45,538 --> 00:34:47,758
He goes "ok."
So he takes out the thorn.

450
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,549
The elephant feels so much better. He says,
"Thank you so muck. How can I repay you? "

451
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:54,772
The mouse goes, "I don't know. I wanna have
my way with you. I find you sexy."

452
00:34:54,846 --> 00:34:57,313
He did. He said "Let me have my way with you."
And the elephant goes, "No!"

453
00:34:57,431 --> 00:35:00,548
He goes, "You promised." You know, he just
climbs up and he just starts doing the elephant.

454
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:04,663
The elephant's like, "Wow, I guess I'll let him finish.
You know, it's the right thing to do here, you know?"

455
00:35:05,123 --> 00:35:08,484
And there's these three monkeys up in a tree.
There they see this mouse hump the elephant.

456
00:35:08,532 --> 00:35:09,493
And like, "Oh, my goodness!"

457
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,911
When they pick up these coconuts,
they just start chucking them.

458
00:35:13,192 --> 00:35:16,867
Finally, they hit the elephant right in the head.
The elephant goes. "Ahah, OMG, that hurts."

459
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:21,995
The mouse doesn't even stop.
He says, "Yeah. Take it all, bitch! Take it all!"

460
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,550
This is my kind of a mouse.
You know what I mean.

461
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,874
Why can't all dancing be this fun?

462
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,917
All dancing is this fun.

463
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,519
Maybe for you.

464
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,679
Russia, huh?

465
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,235
So, whadda you doing in New York then?

466
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,195
Mafia.

467
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,593
You got...

468
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,719
I've got it.

469
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,184
Would it...

470
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,755
...be presumptuous to ask to come up?

471
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,275
Yeah.

472
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,960
Plus, you're not allowed.
Dorm rules.

473
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,316
Well I guess, so, this is good night.

474
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,713
I think so. Yeah.

475
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,119
But not goodbye.

476
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,755
No.

477
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,432
No, not goodbye.

478
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,714
I have to go.

479
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,519
Good night.

480
00:37:39,248 --> 00:37:42,529
-Guys, let's go to another club. I wanna dance.
-Ok! Ok! All right, ma'am.

481
00:37:42,555 --> 00:37:44,618
- Taxi, taxi!
- All right, ma'am. Time to go!

482
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,514
You're sweaty.

483
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,751
I don't mind, because you're sweet.
And so is your sweat.

484
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,319
Sweet sweat.

485
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,999
You are, too.

486
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,111
What? Sweet or sweaty?

487
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,395
Both.

488
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,447
I'm sorry. Sorry.

489
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:22,984
Come on, Jody.

490
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,910
Can't do another one of these today.

491
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,270
(Be) careful with that one.
You break it, you bought it.

492
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,395
Okay, stop.

493
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,795
Stop.

494
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,108
You five, come here.

495
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,428
Oh, God.

496
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,028
When you show up to class
unprepared to work, it's an insult.

497
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,991
Not just to me.
To your fellow students and to the school.

498
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,713
Get out of my class.

499
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,990
How many studios are there altogether?

500
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,115
Eight.

501
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,272
Oh, that's a lot of mirrors.

502
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,633
It was worth it just to see Sergei
getting it on with that old lady.

503
00:39:09,655 --> 00:39:13,276
- OMG! That's right. I have forgotten all about that.
- Guys, we weren't getting it on, ok?

504
00:39:13,302 --> 00:39:14,276
Yeah, right.

505
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,830
I thought she was gonna detach her jaw
and swallow you whole.

506
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,101
You know, I'm just trying to imagine
what the lovely Galina...

507
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:24,913
...will have to say about that.
- No, you can't tell her. No, I was drunk.

508
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,558
- Yes, I can.
- I was lonely.

509
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,111
It didn't mean anything, guys.

510
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,363
I don't know, Sergei.
I'm with Jody.

511
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,836
I believe a girl's had a right to know
what kinda hound she's saving herself...

512
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,672
How about this, huh?

513
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,596
I'm sorry! Don't!

514
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,593
Stop it!

515
00:40:01,047 --> 00:40:04,926
So, there's this jungle, and all these wild animals, lions and tigers. And...

516
00:40:05,264 --> 00:40:07,873
Well, there's this elephant, and he's walking
alone, and he steps on this thorn.

517
00:40:07,899 --> 00:40:11,071
Would it makes sense for Charlie
to partner you in the pas de deux class.

518
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,593
He's very good.

519
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,114
It seems like a waste for him to be partnering Jody.

520
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,792
It's fine. So anyway...

521
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,190
- so he steps on this thorn and it really hurts.
- Honey, I'm trynna talk to you about sth important.

522
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,511
- It's not that important. Just let me finish.
- Not that important?

523
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,870
Having a bad pas de deux partner
is like having a bad tennis partner.

524
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,428
I wouldn't know. I've never played tennis.

525
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,640
What's wrong with you?
Did you just start your period?

526
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,392
No. God.

527
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,876
Well, you're acting strangely.

528
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,673
I'm trying to tell a joke.

529
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,752
Well, I'm trying to have an important
conversation about your future.

530
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,190
Charlie brings out the best in his partner.

531
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,319
That's the kinda thing that'll make a difference
when it comes to cast the student workshop.

532
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,028
I don't think I'll have a hard time
getting a good part, Mom.

533
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,213
You can't afford to be cavalier, Maureen.

534
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,315
Your entire career hangs on
what you're gonna get to dance in the workshop.

535
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,392
I know all this.

536
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,032
Please don't turn into
a sullen teenager on me now.

537
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,957
You've come this far.

538
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,397
(I) thought we were home free.

539
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,034
Anyway...

540
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,433
...I have a meeting with Jonathan today.
I can easily mention the idea of you partnering Charlie.

541
00:41:19,459 --> 00:41:20,208
I'm sure he's agree that...

542
00:41:20,234 --> 00:41:24,836
So, what happens is the elephant goes, "Ow"
and the mouse goes, "Take it all, bitch! "

543
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,438
You're threatened by me.

544
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,558
I'm threatened by no one.

545
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,032
Yeah, you are.
You're afraid of opening the <i>Times...</i>

546
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,113
...and reading that at last, someone is
making interesting dances for ABC.

547
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,878
I'm not an idiot.

548
00:41:48,327 --> 00:41:52,002
If you prove to be a great choreographer,
I'll be begging you to make dances.

549
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,315
But for now, I can only choreograph
for the student workshop.

550
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,879
That's my decision.

551
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,957
You know, you're still hanging
onto all that personal shit.

552
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,230
I don't need to hang onto anything.

553
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,953
I got the girl.

554
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,790
Hi. Do you have a 5:30 class?

555
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,189
- What kind would you like?
- Anything but ballet.

556
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,233
All right, everybody!

557
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,119
Let's do it!

558
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:00,962
Spread out!

559
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,235
Let's start with the usual warm-up.

560
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,270
And, five, six, seven, eight!

561
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,191
Head down. And back.

562
00:43:11,968 --> 00:43:14,163
Right, center, left, center.

563
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,393
Right shoulder.

564
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,833
Left shoulder.

565
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,394
Hey, you made it! All right.

566
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,479
Alternate.

567
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,594
And second!

568
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,913
That's it. Roll it.

569
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,916
Roll those hips.

570
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,312
Come on. Mix it.

571
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,269
Get ready to get down and contract.

572
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,312
Down and...

573
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,908
...contract. And down.

574
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,634
And get it up.

575
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,711
Lots of action over here!

576
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,158
Push it out.

577
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,679
Come on, hold it.

578
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:16,231
All right. Stretch out. Up!
Kick it up! And up!

579
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,754
Okay. Other side.

580
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,875
Up!

581
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,874
And up. You've got it.

582
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,719
All right.

583
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,596
All right. You're gonna get up.
And I want you to bow.

584
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,439
And stretch.

585
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,572
All right. I wanna
take it from the top.

586
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:46,377
I want it full out. Look, just forget
about the steps.

587
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,670
Just dance the shit out of it.

588
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,710
And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

589
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,991
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four.

590
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,673
Hit it, boys.

591
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,157
Yeah. All right.
That was great!

592
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,709
All right, girls. Come on.

593
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,429
Go!

594
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,758
Yes! Go for it.

595
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,073
Go for it!

596
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,629
All right!

597
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,070
Get you, Mr. Choreographer.

598
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,999
It's only for workshop.

599
00:47:32,103 --> 00:47:33,768
Well, just make sure
you take chances, OK?

600
00:47:33,794 --> 00:47:36,280
'cause you really suck
when you play it safe.

601
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,675
Thanks. That's sweet. Really.

602
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,836
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

603
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,079
Great class.

604
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,235
Thanks. See you.

605
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,679
Jody Sawyer.

606
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,760
You see?
Told you I'd remember your name.

607
00:47:53,158 --> 00:47:54,583
Whadda you doing way down here?

608
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:55,697
Is that a problem?

609
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:58,589
I mean, I know I'm not supposed to
be taking class at other places.

610
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,989
Like I care. You looked great up there.

611
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,149
Thanks.

612
00:48:03,377 --> 00:48:05,392
You know, It's just that class.

613
00:48:05,418 --> 00:48:08,378
I mean, How can't I dance like that
in my ABA classes?

614
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,478
Because ABA has a great big stick up its ass?

615
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,031
- Have you had dinner yet?
- Yeah.

616
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,108
Dessert?

617
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,115
- Hop on. We'll go for a ride.
- Okay.

618
00:48:44,024 --> 00:48:45,975
(I) could've sworn I had some cookies or sth.

619
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,358
It's okay. I shouldn't eat them any way.
I'm in enough trouble with my body as it is.

620
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,156
Where are you getting that from?
Jonathan?

621
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,233
Yeah. That, plus my feet suck.
I'm poorly trained.

622
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,512
And I can never be a dancer, ever.

623
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,478
Jonathan's a moron.

624
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,149
I couldn't take my eyes off you tonight.

625
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,192
Best I could do.

626
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,154
Cheers.

627
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,393
I meant it, you know.

628
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,958
I noticed your dancing
before I recognized your face.

629
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,273
I have to admit I recognized your face first.

630
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,918
You want anything?

631
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,350
- Water? Some more wine?
- No.

632
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,036
I can keep looking for those cookies.

633
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,473
I'm fine.

634
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,398
<i>Cooper, it's Jonathan.</i>

635
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,512
<i>We'll be at girl's class at the school at 10:00 a.m. Monday morning</i>

636
00:51:12,538 --> 00:51:14,591
<i>to finalize workshop casting.</i>

637
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,955
<i>Be there.</i>

638
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,037
chassé, relevé. chassé, tendu.

639
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,555
Plié.

640
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,751
Anna, I asked for a double pirouette there.
Not a triple. Again, please.

641
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,875
Faster spotting, ladies. Steven.

642
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,079
It's a chassé, not a tombé, Pasquale.

643
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,156
I want a clean double.

644
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:52,195
Sorry. I thought there was room for three.
I mean, wouldn't it be better if we all did a triple?

645
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,353
A double. End of discussion.

646
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,033
You wanna use her?

647
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,594
That's much better, Nicole. Yes.

648
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,510
Really give it size, ladies.

649
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,870
Don't flap the wrists, Emily.

650
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,556
Beautiful, Aesha.

651
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,631
All right, ladies. Maureen.

652
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,551
Good jumps, good elevation.

653
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,832
But you'll really fly more
if it's from the heart.

654
00:52:30,684 --> 00:52:34,796
Now, who cares what she thinks anyway?
Juliette Simone, please.

655
00:52:35,023 --> 00:52:39,008
Her name's Julie Simon, She grew up in Perth Amboy
and her father managed a Wal-Mart.

656
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,716
Just don't let it get to you.
(It) doesn't mean a thing.

657
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,990
Just in case you guys (were) wondering,
casting's going up at 1:00 p.m.

658
00:53:12,206 --> 00:53:16,677
Daddy? I got the lead in <i>Italian Symphony.</i>
That's Gelsey Kirkland's old part.

659
00:53:17,049 --> 00:53:20,316
No, Maureen got the lead in Jonathan's ballet,
but that has way more people.

660
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,791
Well deserved, sweetie.
Aren't you pleased?

661
00:53:22,817 --> 00:53:23,352
Jody!

662
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,428
Miss Thing, you're doing a piece
with the two of us.

663
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:27,993
What piece?

664
00:53:28,183 --> 00:53:30,174
- A totally new ballet.
- A world premiere.

665
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,071
- Made on us.
- Who's choreographing?

666
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,838
We can always find
some more rehearsal time later.

667
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,469
Hi.

668
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,512
This is for you.

669
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,156
Thanks.

670
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,313
I just want you to know how much
it means to me to be in your ballet. And...

671
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,358
I won't let you down.

672
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,752
Well, you are the best for the part.
Simple as that.

673
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,676
It's some dessert. So...

674
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,069
...you'll have some on hand next time.

675
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,429
Bye.

676
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,875
What?

677
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,518
I didn't say anything.

678
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,629
Take these.

679
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,554
Nonsense. You heard her.
They're for next time.

680
00:54:25,353 --> 00:54:25,961
Hey.

681
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,553
Congratulations.

682
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,232
Cooper's ballet.

683
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,351
Yeah. Kind of amazing.

684
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,752
It should be good.

685
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,389
I guess.

686
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,468
Jody says he has all these theories
about making ballet for the people.

687
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,313
I do ballet 'cause it has
nothing to do with the people.

688
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,198
Give me tiaras and boys in tights any day.

689
00:54:50,775 --> 00:54:53,494
I hear you're in the corps
in Jonathan's ballet.

690
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,829
Yeah.

691
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,033
Just goes to show, don't piss off the boss.

692
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,440
No one will see me and I'll never get a job.

693
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,679
I'm sorry.

694
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,836
Big deal. I don't care.

695
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,356
Yeah.

696
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,079
I know.

697
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,357
It sucks, doesn't it?

698
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,275
What?

699
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,473
Not caring.

700
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,879
Kind of, yeah.

701
00:55:41,694 --> 00:55:45,726
Five, six, seven, eight.

702
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,032
All eyes are on you.

703
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,190
Your eyes are only on Maureen.

704
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,478
Present your chest.

705
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,193
Walk gallantly.

706
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,771
Breathe.

707
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,192
The man's a fossil.
He should be in a museum.

708
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,527
(Do) you have a question, Miss Rodriguez?

709
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,796
Yeah. What is it about?

710
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,510
The music.

711
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,035
It's an expression of harmony
that isn't of this world.

712
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,509
Sergei, chest up.

713
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,518
That's it.

714
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,959
Soft hand.

715
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,671
Soft hand, Maureen. That's it.

716
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,237
I want this as real as it can be.
It's a triangle.

717
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,153
She's a ballerina,
and she's in love with you, Eric.

718
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,869
And Charlie's the other guy.
He's the director of a ballet company.

719
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,151
Okay. Let's fool around with the steps.
See what we got.

720
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,114
Okay. Step, touch, step, touch.

721
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,031
Pas de bourr閑. Double pirouette.

722
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,350
All right, you keep doing that.
You watch this.

723
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,795
Do the double pirouette,
down to the knee...

724
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,155
...then give me your left arm.

725
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:08,270
I'll slide you over here.
And then, lift you up like this.

726
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,989
That'll work.

727
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:16,928
Eva!

728
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,595
You don't like him very much, do you?

729
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,198
I don't blame you.

730
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,512
He's impossible.

731
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,276
Headstrong, egotistical, unforgiving.

732
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,597
Arrogant as all hell.

733
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:48,114
The thing is, you'll be hard-pressed to find
any choreographer or company director...

734
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,918
...who isn't like that.

735
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,991
The unwise dancers blame them.

736
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,750
"He didn't like me." "She was unfair."

737
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,876
"I should've had that part."

738
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,354
The smart ones know where to look...

739
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,552
...when things get rough.

740
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,593
It isn't there.

741
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,589
It's here.

742
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,915
No matter what happened in class...

743
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,517
in performance, last week,
five minutes ago...

744
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,836
if you come back here...

745
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,353
...you'll be home.

746
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,432
So how was your rehearsal?

747
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,431
It was all right. You know.

748
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,717
- And the king of ballet?
- Jonathan's fine.

749
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:43,510
But Juliette Simone, what a nosy bitch!

750
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,279
She thinks she knows
everything about everyone.

751
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,551
And where are you guys going?

752
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,598
It's Eric's birthday,
so we're gonna take him out.

753
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,953
Well, have fun.

754
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,158
Do you wanna come?

755
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,673
Well, Jim was gonna swing by.
Can he come, too?

756
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,479
Sure. Bring your mom as well. Okay?

757
00:59:48,448 --> 00:59:50,916
Guys, I got a little something here for you.

758
00:59:51,267 --> 00:59:53,274
Guys, what is this?

759
00:59:53,603 --> 00:59:54,548
Oh, God!

760
00:59:56,507 --> 00:59:59,119
Hey, you shouldn't be eating doughnuts.
They're bad for you.

761
01:00:00,197 --> 01:00:02,510
I don't wanna miss this shot.
Come on. Eric, in front.

762
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,992
You never stop, do you?

763
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,832
They still hate my body.

764
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,605
You're way too hard on yourself.
You looked great in rehearsal.

765
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,550
- That ballet is so not ABC.
- You don't like it?

766
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,429
Who cares what I like?
The workshop's about what Jonathan likes.

767
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,911
Is getting into the company
really all that matters to you?

768
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,711
It's so different for you, Charlie.
They love you!

769
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,031
I mean, they practically printed your name
in the programs already.

770
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,920
You need to take some time
away from all this.

771
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,470
That is the last thing that I need.

772
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,716
We could go out sometime.

773
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,268
Like a date?

774
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,238
Yeah. Like a date.

775
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:57,395
That's really sweet, Charlie,
but I'm kind of seeing someone.

776
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,798
Sorry. I didn't realize.

777
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,395
No. It's just that it's new, and I don't wanna
make a big thing of it, you know.

778
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,074
Sure, yeah. No big thing.

779
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,915
Hey, you haven't seen my girlfriend,
have you? Tall, thin, legs for days?

780
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,630
Yeah. I pushed her overboard.

781
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:34,954
You okay?

782
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,670
Fine. Just motion sickness, you know.

783
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,796
- You want some water or anything?
- No, it passed.

784
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:40,671
- Sure?
- Yeah.

785
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:41,765
All right.

786
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,154
No, Eric!

787
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,193
This is about sex.

788
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,673
I want you to feel it.
Let me show you.

789
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,553
Now you see where I am? I'm right up against her.
My hips are right up against her.

790
01:02:01,702 --> 01:02:03,142
- You got it?
- Yeah. I got it.

791
01:02:03,236 --> 01:02:03,690
Okay.

792
01:02:04,402 --> 01:02:05,019
Charlie,

793
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,436
What do you think about this
for the end of the pas de trois?

794
01:02:14,825 --> 01:02:16,099
Can I see that?

795
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,995
Sure.

796
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,078
I changed it a little.

797
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,639
(It) could work.

798
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,999
That could work, too.

799
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,679
How about like that?

800
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,431
Why don't you just try this?

801
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,473
I could work on it.

802
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,634
You do that.

803
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,556
Moving on.

804
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,473
Girls! Girls! Arms over the top
before going into the arabesque.

805
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,154
Boys, you've got to watch each other
in the lift.

806
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,550
Emily, you're out of line.
Look at the diagonal. Look at it.

807
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,631
Maureen, wake up.
Where's your focus?

808
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,762
You'll be onstage in less than a month.

809
01:03:16,012 --> 01:03:20,756
How do you expect 3,000 people to watch you
raise your arm if you don't do it beautifully?

810
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,294
Whadda you doing here?

811
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,222
I wanted to surprise you.

812
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,716
You looked amazing out there.

813
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,195
- Thanks.
- Your pirouettes were amazing.

814
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,071
Amazing and tiring, huh?

815
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,238
Friend of Cooper's?

816
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:04,879
Kind of.

817
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,675
You are in big trouble.

818
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,878
She's in my ballet.

819
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,354
Please.

820
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:09,476
She's a heartbeat away from
tattooing your name on her ass.

821
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,792
- wanna go to my place?
- Sure.

822
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:16,949
All right.

823
01:06:18,294 --> 01:06:20,012
- See you.
- See you tomorrow.

824
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,679
Where are we going?

825
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:22,749
Night.

826
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,439
- Lexington?
- All right.

827
01:06:26,226 --> 01:06:27,579
Good night.

828
01:06:34,459 --> 01:06:36,370
- Oops. Excuse me.
- Goodness.

829
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,397
No, my fault entirely.

830
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,831
It's good I didn't step on one of your feet,
you could sue me.

831
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,912
Don't worry. They're not as valuable
as they used to be.

832
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,991
So, how's Jonathan's ballet coming along?

833
01:06:47,056 --> 01:06:49,934
- It's gonna be beautiful. Really lovely.
- Oh, good.

834
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,032
- Is Maureen feeling better?
- Better than what?

835
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:57,670
She said she felt like she was
coming down with something. A bug.

836
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,716
Right. That bug.

837
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:04,552
What brings you here
to our humble part of the city?

838
01:07:04,661 --> 01:07:07,841
Well, Cooper invited me to watch his rehearsal.

839
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,315
He did?
How nice you two have kept in touch.

840
01:07:10,441 --> 01:07:12,033
Well, just a bit.

841
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:16,915
- You know, he's being nice to a tired old lady.
- Nonsense.

842
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:17,974
Oh.

843
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:19,869
Have fun.

844
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,473
Okay, guys. Let's take it from the bridge.

845
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,994
Is that clear?

846
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,112
Jody, you're right here.

847
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,072
Yesterday I was stage left.

848
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,352
Well, today you're stage right.

849
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,396
What am I gonna be tomorrow?

850
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:47,909
Excuse me?

851
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,871
Well, I mean you keep changing your mind.
It's kinda hard to keep track.

852
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,913
It's not that complicated.

853
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,230
I want what I say I want,
when I say I want it.

854
01:07:56,311 --> 01:08:00,623
- You got a problem with that?
- Yeah. Maybe I do.

855
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,712
What about what I want?

856
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:10,358
I don't give a shit what you want!
You're a dancer. Period.

857
01:08:10,478 --> 01:08:14,266
You do what I want and if you're not gonna do that,
then what the hell are you doing here?

858
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,514
I'm afraid that's how ballets get made.

859
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,194
It's all very dramatic.

860
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:38,433
Don't look at me.
I'm too embarrassed.

861
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:42,309
You were saying how you felt.
What's embarrassing about that?

862
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:46,116
How a dancer feels
doesn't matter to a choreographer.

863
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,855
No, but how a woman feels

864
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,314
should matter to the guy she's seeing.

865
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,832
Do you think I'm an idiot
for getting involved with him?

866
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,235
No.

867
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:05,199
I think he's an idiot
for not treating you well.

868
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:08,791
Come on. Let's go back.

869
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,469
- I can't.
- Sure you can.

870
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,110
No. I'm all splotchy.

871
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,479
I feel...

872
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,959
So use it.

873
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:20,196
What?

874
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,875
Whatever you feel. Just dance it.

875
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,396
And you're not splotchy.

876
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,679
I'm sorry.

877
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,635
I'm ready.

878
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,429
All right. Let's take it from the top.

879
01:10:38,936 --> 01:10:40,574
Good morning, Mrs. Cummings.

880
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:41,573
Good morning, Emily.

881
01:10:41,599 --> 01:10:43,702
Maureen, sweet, can I steal
you away for a moment?

882
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,228
- I've got class.
- This won't take long.

883
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,275
Juliette says you've been off lately.

884
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:01,239
- You talked to Juliette about me?
- She sought me out. She talked to me.

885
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,552
- She did?
- Yes, she did.

886
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,155
She asked me if you're doing better,
which means you were doing poorly.

887
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:12,074
A bug. For God's sakes,
it's not even a good lie.

888
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,820
I know what's going on, Maureen.

889
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,436
You should ask yourself,
what's this boy doing to your dancing?

890
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:27,639
And the ladies have to make fifth
before the show starts.

891
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,119
Stop! Stop!

892
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:33,535
Maureen.

893
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,952
You make it look like work.

894
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:40,278
I need to see the movement,
not the effort behind it.

895
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,831
Thank you. We're out of time.
We'll pick this up tomorrow.

896
01:11:45,055 --> 01:11:46,305
Emily.

897
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,076
Can I see you in my office, please?

898
01:11:55,365 --> 01:11:56,490
Emily.

899
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,238
What happened?

900
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,233
I'm going home.

901
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,758
What did he say to you?

902
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,949
He told me I couldn't be in the workshop.

903
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:12,354
He told me that he don't take enough pride
in my body. He just thinks I'm too fat.

904
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,910
God, I could kill that man!
You're not fat! You're beautiful.

905
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,556
So you're leaving for good?

906
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,955
Yeah. My mom thinks it's best.

907
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,279
Dancing used to make her happy
and it doesn't anymore, so we've had enough.

908
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:30,032
I want you girls to promise me you won't let anyone
make you feel bad about yourself, okay?

909
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,754
You're perfect the way God made you.

910
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,158
We have to go, sweetie.

911
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,354
Look.

912
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:09,034
I know I'm not a doctor yet or anything...

913
01:13:09,408 --> 01:13:11,638
but I do know that what you're doing
is really bad for you.

914
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,274
- I wasn't feeling well.
- Maureen, please.

915
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,313
What do you know?

916
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,920
I know that no goal
is worth making yourself sick.

917
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,014
Yeah? Maybe my goal is
a little more demanding than yours.

918
01:13:24,647 --> 01:13:29,334
Medicine is plenty demanding, thank you,
but I am not about to start hurting myself for it!

919
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,759
I'm not hurting.

920
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:34,623
I'm making decisions,
sacrifices for what I want.

921
01:13:34,649 --> 01:13:36,830
Oh, like you know what you want!

922
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,433
What's that supposed to mean?

923
01:13:38,579 --> 01:13:42,090
You know what?
Call me crazy, but I find it hard to believe

924
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:45,946
that a girl who is throwing up
everything she eats

925
01:13:45,972 --> 01:13:49,151
is all that in tune
with her wants and needs.

926
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:53,758
You know what? I don't need this.
Not from you. God.

927
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:57,432
I'm sorry. Please, don't go running out
here in the middle of the night.

928
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,748
Just back off!

929
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,273
Maureen, listen to me.

930
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,231
Wait. Look. I don't...

931
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,956
I don't wanna drive you away.

932
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:10,994
- I just wanna help you.
- I don't need any help. I'm fine.

933
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,989
I, am the best goddamn dancer
in the American Ballet Academy.

934
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,670
Who the hell are you? Nobody.

935
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,636
If you let go of your center...

936
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:04,350
...it will just happen, naturally.

937
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,232
Now release the neck.

938
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,354
Lovely.

939
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,757
Do you wanna show me again?

940
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,073
You wouldn't mind?

941
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:34,113
Not in the least.

942
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:37,832
All right, boys and girls,
let's go to the opening diagonals.

943
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,771
I know some of you are Hearing
the orchestra for the first time

944
01:15:40,797 --> 01:15:42,294
but that doesn't
mean you can stop counting.

945
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:45,670
You're all off the music.
You must remember your counts.

946
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,353
Keep going.

947
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:51,913
- Are you sure it's in here?
- That's what Sergei said.

948
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,797
I wanna see straight diagonals...

949
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,871
Oh, my God!

950
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:00,433
<i>"Dancing a new work choreographed
by Cooper Nielson are Jody Sawyer,</i>

951
01:16:00,511 --> 01:16:03,469
- <i>Charles Sims and Eric O. Jones."
- Eric, check this out.</i>

952
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,677
People, please! This is a rehearsal,
not a social hour!

953
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:14,235
- I've never been in the paper before.
- I know. Me neither.

954
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,311
It's kind of cool, huh?

955
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,238
Are you guys warmed up?

956
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,274
Of course.

957
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,960
Five, six, seven, eight. One...

958
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,793
We don't invite press to workshop.
You know that.

959
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,359
I didn't invite anyone.

960
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:33,877
Nancy says every paper has called,
and all they ask about is your ballet.

961
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:37,398
Hey, if there's interest, that's great,
but other than that...

962
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:38,515
Bullshit.

963
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:39,868
One more time.

964
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:43,794
What are you up to?
Phoning press, kissing Joan Miller's ass.

965
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:47,649
She hasn't shown any interest in the company
since she started spending time with you.

966
01:16:47,704 --> 01:16:48,610
Well,

967
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,151
What do you know?
I guess I got the girl this time.

968
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:54,749
Shit.

969
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:58,753
You all right?

970
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,394
Where is it?

971
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,678
Man, I'm so sorry.

972
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,520
Well, you'd better start rehearsing
the understudy.

973
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,918
It's Andre. He's not good enough.
I can't use him.

974
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,719
Well, you have to use him.
Eric can't dance.

975
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,079
I'm gonna do it.

976
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,036
You can't do that, Cooper.

977
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,677
The workshop's for students.

978
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:28,912
If you want your students to dance my ballet tomorrow, they'll dance with me.

979
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,992
Otherwise, I'm pulling it.

980
01:17:35,795 --> 01:17:36,780
Hey.

981
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,309
You okay?

982
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,237
Eric got injured today.

983
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:47,315
And you know the first thing I thought
when I saw him go down?

984
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:48,595
What?

985
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,832
I wished that was me.

986
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:55,673
So, that made me think, you know,
'cause that's not a normal reaction.

987
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:01,432
How much of what you liked about me
was because I was a ballet dancer, and

988
01:18:01,618 --> 01:18:04,150
how much because I was me?

989
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,230
I can't do it.

990
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,445
I can't dance with him.

991
01:18:12,471 --> 01:18:14,382
Why? Because he dumped you?

992
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:17,557
No. Because he's the best dancer
in the world.

993
01:18:18,642 --> 01:18:19,384
Jody.

994
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:22,997
Jody, You'll be fine.
Just get some sleep.

995
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:27,008
You know, with Eric, I stood a chance of
showing Jonathan how wrong he is about me.

996
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,876
Now, like, it's Cooper,
I'm gonna look like a total amateur.

997
01:18:31,277 --> 01:18:31,894
Hey,

998
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,751
Where were you? Rehearsing?

999
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,150
How's Eric?

1000
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,674
Well, he can't dance tomorrow.
How would you be?

1001
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:38,529
Relieved.

1002
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:39,258
What?

1003
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,315
Right!

1004
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:43,658
They think the sun shines out of your ass,
so you'd still make the company.

1005
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,274
Just my luck.

1006
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,191
I would kill for your luck.

1007
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,510
All I've ever wanted
was to be in the American Ballet Company.

1008
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:55,075
Well, there are three places going tomorrow.

1009
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:59,631
And if you both could just chill out and get
some sleep, you could get two of them.

1010
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,352
You're welcome to my place.

1011
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:06,201
Me? No. I screwed up any chance I had
back in September.

1012
01:19:06,303 --> 01:19:07,077
Eva.

1013
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:11,156
But I started dancing
long before this stupid workshop...

1014
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:14,358
...and I'm gonna keep on dancing
long after it.

1015
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,236
So tomorrow is one more day
I get to dance.

1016
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,919
Tomorrow's when they decide
the rest of my life.

1017
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,590
I'm not dancing for them anymore.

1018
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:27,038
I'm dancing for me.

1019
01:19:28,894 --> 01:19:29,855
Can we just...

1020
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,551
Let's just go to sleep.

1021
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,312
Have a wonderful afternoon.
It's about thanks for your support.

1022
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,152
Oh, Eric, how are you?

1023
01:19:47,281 --> 01:19:50,239
Ur, It's a sprain.
I have to stay off of it for six weeks.

1024
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,914
Just long enough to ruin my entire career.

1025
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,512
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your half-hour call.

1026
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,111
- Is Miami here?
- Everyone's here.

1027
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,509
I'd kill to get an offer from Miami.

1028
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,118
I can't wear that.

1029
01:20:11,778 --> 01:20:14,372
OMG! It's totally packed. Come here.

1030
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,119
Can you believe this?

1031
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,960
OMG! Okay, I'm nervous. Let's go.

1032
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,148
Nicole, merde.

1033
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,510
- Gillian, Lena. Merde.
- Thank you for your work.

1034
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,670
- This is what we worked for.
- Anna, merde.

1035
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:35,548
- Still only room for three of us in the company?
- Don't even think about it.

1036
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,435
All right.

1037
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,556
Merde. Thank you, ladies.

1038
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:54,832
Places! Places!

1039
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,075
And curtain warmers out. Go.

1040
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,153
Warm the curtain.

1041
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,151
And curtain. Go.

1042
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,750
How you feeling? You ready?

1043
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:20,869
I guess so.

1044
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:24,396
Look, those fouett閟 at the end?
I really need you to be on your leg.

1045
01:21:24,426 --> 01:21:24,971
I know.

1046
01:21:25,031 --> 01:21:26,790
Because in rehearsals,
it hasn't been going well.

1047
01:21:26,816 --> 01:21:27,174
I know.

1048
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:31,193
It's at the end of the ballet
and we need everything together and tight.

1049
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,234
I know.

1050
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,716
Sorry, of course you do.

1051
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,476
(I) just want everything to be perfect.

1052
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,869
Why don't you let me finish warming up?

1053
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,152
You're gonna be great.

1054
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,155
- See you out there?
- See you.

1055
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:06,718
Listen, forget him.

1056
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:09,756
Just dance it like you feel it.

1057
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,752
Easy as that?

1058
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:14,398
I('ve) got to warm up.

1059
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,629
They loved you. Thanks.

1060
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:26,516
- Did you see how on I was tonight?
- Yeah, totally on.

1061
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:37,516
- Okay. Good luck.
- Thanks.

1062
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,438
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1063
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,996
What's going on? Does Jonathan know?
Where's Maureen?

1064
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:39,592
What's Maureen?
What happened to Maureen?

1065
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,790
I thought Maureen had this role.

1066
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,710
It says here, "Maureen Cummings."

1067
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,639
Excuse me.

1068
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,676
- Mom.
- What's wrong?

1069
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,552
- Are you sick?
- No.

1070
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:41,030
Then why the hell is that trash
out there dancing your part?

1071
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,873
Because I wanted her to.
She's not trash.

1072
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:47,112
I don't know, Jesus Christ! Maureen.
I don't know how to respond to this.

1073
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,233
You could ask me why.

1074
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:52,034
Okay, fine. Why, in God's name?

1075
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:54,398
I don't wanna be a ballet dancer.

1076
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,198
Yes, you do. You always have.

1077
01:24:56,303 --> 01:25:00,296
No, Mom. If this were what I wanted,
I wouldn't be as unhappy as I've been.

1078
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,999
I'd have friends. I'd sleep well.

1079
01:25:03,295 --> 01:25:05,411
I wouldn't throw up half the things I eat.

1080
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,232
You watch your weight.
(Is) there something wrong with that?

1081
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:10,357
God! Don't you hear me?
I'm telling you I'm unhappy and sick.

1082
01:25:10,567 --> 01:25:13,400
I can't do this anymore.
Don't you care about me?

1083
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:17,599
Of course I care.
But this is your dream.

1084
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:20,480
Maureen, don't just throw away your dream!

1085
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:22,353
It's your dream.

1086
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:26,235
And it matters more to you
than anything mattered to me.

1087
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:30,189
So I did it, but I can't anymore.

1088
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:35,116
Sweet, it's not that I don't care
about your feelings. I do.

1089
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,948
It's just that...
You see...

1090
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,154
I know.

1091
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:44,799
I know what regret feels like
and I don't want that for you.

1092
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:48,040
I know what it's like to look back and wish.

1093
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,395
That's what ballet would be for me.

1094
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,953
A life of wishing
that I found something I really loved

1095
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,918
instead of something
I just happened to do well.

1096
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:04,230
I'm not you, Mom. I mean,
you didn't have the feet.

1097
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,832
I don't have the heart.

1098
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:21,758
That was beautiful.

1099
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:24,912
She was fantastic.

1100
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,793
She was okay.

1101
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,749
Well, brace yourself for what's next.

1102
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,997
And one, two...

1103
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,279
...three, four...

1104
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,159
...five, six...

1105
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,193
...seven, eight.

1106
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:07,958
- That's it! Beautiful!
- Places, please. Places!

1107
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:10,834
Places for the curtain call.
Here we go!

1108
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:01,430
Eva, I'm gonna kill you!

1109
01:40:01,456 --> 01:40:05,669
- Oh, I'm so sorry. I wanted to tell you.
- What's wrong? Are you crazy?

1110
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:10,670
There you are. Cooper, darling!
You were wonderful.

1111
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:13,150
You were beautiful.
You were wonderful, too!

1112
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:14,958
I'll have to steal him away.

1113
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:16,871
I'm stealing you away.

1114
01:40:17,063 --> 01:40:18,024
Excuse me.

1115
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:20,757
I have the small rehearsal room.

1116
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:23,752
- Do you want the girls first or the boys?
- Girls.

1117
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,831
Will you excuse me, please?

1118
01:40:27,004 --> 01:40:29,926
- Tell me more.
- I've got dancers and I've a place already scouted out.

1119
01:40:30,013 --> 01:40:30,677
We put up the student.

1120
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:32,512
It was her idea!

1121
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:41,155
Oh, God. What happened?

1122
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:43,918
What did he say?

1123
01:40:52,687 --> 01:40:55,426
Mom! Oh, I'm so happy
you guys are here.

1124
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:58,627
Come on! We wanted to see
what you've been up to this past year.

1125
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:00,592
And I've got to tell you...

1126
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,838
...that was the most fantastic thing
I've ever seen.

1127
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,356
It was great, honey.
Just wonderful.

1128
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,436
You wanna know something stupid?

1129
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:13,830
I'd actually started to believe
I didn't need to hear that anymore.

1130
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,558
I made it. I made it!

1131
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:17,919
Thank you.

1132
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,355
We'll see you later at the dorm.

1133
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:27,034
Yeah, we'll see you at the dorm.

1134
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:29,710
Excuse me. Eva Rodriguez.

1135
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:33,631
Jonathan wants to see you.

1136
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:40,758
What you did today
was completely disrespectful.

1137
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,435
I'm sorry.

1138
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:50,232
Or actually, I'm not.

1139
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:53,472
Because that was the best time
I ever had in my life.

1140
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:57,270
Jesus! That's a great ballet!
Jonathan, you know that?

1141
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,594
Thank you. And you were great in it.

1142
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:06,712
And I'd like to have you
as a member of the company...

1143
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,313
if you'll join us.

1144
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:15,269
Are you nuts?

1145
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:18,511
I hope not, but that depends
entirely on you, doesn't it?

1146
01:42:27,737 --> 01:42:28,424
Hey.

1147
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:29,642
Guess what?

1148
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:33,191
I just talked to Joan Miller. She loved the ballet
and wants to fund my company.

1149
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:35,292
- I'm gonna have my own company.
- You're kidding?

1150
01:42:35,318 --> 01:42:35,792
No.

1151
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,036
God! Congratulations.

1152
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:42,237
Listen, you have to be in my company.

1153
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:44,278
You'll be its star.

1154
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:46,278
We'll be great together.

1155
01:42:48,492 --> 01:42:49,391
Jody.

1156
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,512
They're ready for you.

1157
01:43:17,266 --> 01:43:17,657
Jody.

1158
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:19,669
Wait.

1159
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:23,472
For ten years...

1160
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:28,076
all I've wanted was to be one of American
Ballet Company's perfect ballerinas.

1161
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:31,436
I've wanted to be you, Juliette.

1162
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:34,032
But I'm not you.

1163
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:37,348
And I'm not perfect. I'm just me.

1164
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:39,518
Bad feet and all.

1165
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,797
And I'm starting to think
I like that even better.

1166
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:45,915
No.

1167
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:47,433
Please don't.

1168
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:52,798
Because if you're not offering me a place
in the company, then I don't wanna hear it.

1169
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,638
And if you are...

1170
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,714
...I might not have the strength to say no.

1171
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:04,830
And then I'd spend my best dancing years
in the back of a corps, waving a rose back and forth.

1172
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:07,152
And I'm better than that.

1173
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:12,671
So thank you, Jonathan, for turning me into
the best dancer I can be.

1174
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:15,389
I appreciate it more than I can say, really.

1175
01:44:15,695 --> 01:44:19,085
Because the best dancer
I can be is a principal

1176
01:44:19,193 --> 01:44:22,192
in Cooper Nielson's new company.

1177
01:44:38,763 --> 01:44:39,419
Eric.

1178
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:44,795
Girl, you are too many things.
I cannot believe it.

1179
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:47,713
I know. I really think Jonathan
shoulda have his head examined.

1180
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:50,792
Oh yeah, 'cause he's taking
head cases and cripples.

1181
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:53,754
- You're in?
- Yes. Bum foot and all!

1182
01:44:54,967 --> 01:44:58,725
- Maureen, you could've told me.
- Sergei, I am so sorry. I really wanted to tell you.

1183
01:44:58,838 --> 01:45:01,636
It's okay. I got San Francisco, with Galina.

1184
01:45:01,662 --> 01:45:02,480
Oh.

1185
01:45:02,727 --> 01:45:04,604
- That's perfect.
- That's great. Congrats, bud.

1186
01:45:04,703 --> 01:45:07,177
- Thanks. I'll catch up with you later again, OK?
- Congratulations.

1187
01:45:07,203 --> 01:45:07,712
See ya.

1188
01:45:08,886 --> 01:45:09,824
Hey.

1189
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,916
Everyone says you were beautiful.

1190
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:16,678
You didn't watch?

1191
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:19,872
Are you all right?

1192
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:23,398
Not really. No. But I will be.

1193
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:26,296
You will be.

1194
01:45:26,393 --> 01:45:26,995
Eric.

1195
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:30,676
- What did you think?
- You were okay, for an understudy.

1196
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:31,988
I did what I could.

1197
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,833
Congratulations.
I hear you got yourself a spot here.

1198
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:37,514
Yep. And I hear you got yourself
a principal dancer.

1199
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:42,915
- You with me?
- I'm with you!

1200
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:48,151
You're not gonna regret this.

1201
01:45:50,561 --> 01:45:51,288
Cooper.

1202
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:55,835
You're an amazing dancer
and you're a great choreographer, but...

1203
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:59,199
as a boyfriend,
you kind of suck.

1204
01:46:00,023 --> 01:46:01,633
- Hey, Jody.
- Hey.

1205
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:04,910
- So, what happened?
- I got in here.

1206
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:07,230
OMG. That's amazing!

1207
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:12,720
- Jonathan said you're joining Cooper's company?
- Yeah.

1208
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:15,915
I'm starting out as a principal.

1209
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:20,711
What more could a girl want?

1210
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:26,678
A date for the party tonight, for one thing.

1211
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:30,598
Are you asking me out?

1212
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:31,795
Yeah.

1213
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:33,998
Are you saying yes?

1214
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:36,153
I guess so.

1215
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:37,715
Yeah.

1216
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:47,668
Come on.

1217
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:51,519
Jody Sawyer.

1218
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,991
