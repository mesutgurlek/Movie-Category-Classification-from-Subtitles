1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,800
David Beckham
gets the ball again for Manchester United.

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,120
He's taking responsibility
every time they have possession.

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,840
This reflects the way
he's been captaining England.

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,680
He's dominating proceedings,
hoping perhaps to get a bit more support

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,320
as he gathers the ball on this
right-hand touchline time after time.

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,040
And the Old Trafford crowd warming
to the way Beckham is taking over,

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,920
but the question is, where is
the goal going to come from

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,600
to break down Anderlecht?

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,280
Will it be Scholes? Could it be Ryan
Giggs? Would it be Beckham himself?

10
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,200
Because Anderlecht are playing
a very controlled game.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,800
This is Radzinski,
testing the United defence,

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,480
and Sylvestre possibly with a chance
to break forward on the other flank.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,120
And there's the ball
that Beckham really wants.

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,080
That looked like a body check,
but he shrugged off the defender.

15
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,760
It's a decent cross,
and there is Bhamra. It's a fine header,

16
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,800
and she's scored!

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,320
It's a goal by Jess Bhamra! A superb
header, beating the defender,

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,120
and planting the ball beyond the
goalkeeper's left hand. Jess Bhamra

19
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,040
makes a name for herself
at Old Trafford!

20
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,720
And have we discovered
a new star here, Gary Lineker?

21
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,840
That's right. Could Bhamra be the
answer to England's prayers? Alan?

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,400
Quick thinking, comfortable on the ball,
vision and awareness - magnificent.

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
I wish she was playing for Scotland!

24
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,280
John, have England found the player
to relive their '66 World Cup glory?

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,400
Definitely, and the best thing is,
she's not even reached her peak yet.

26
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,800
We're joined now by Jess's mother.

27
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,680
- You must be proud of your daughter.
- Not at all!

28
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,600
She shouldn't be showing
her bare legs to 70,000 people!

29
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,160
She's bringing shame on the family.
Don't encourage her!

30
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,440
Jesminder, you get back home now!

31
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,000
Are you listening to me?

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,360
Have you gone mad? Football, shootball!

33
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,880
Your sister's getting engaged,
and you're watching this skinhead boy!

34
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,560
It's Beckham's corner!

35
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,680
Come downstairs.
Your sister's going crazy.

36
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,280
I've got to go!
Mum, where are my keys?

37
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,320
I'm sick of this wedding
and it hasn't even started!

38
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,200
That girl is a first-class bitch!

39
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,840
- Pinky, you've got so many others!
- I need another one!

40
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,800
- Get a move on!
- What the hell's going on?

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,960
Teet's bloody sister says she's
wearing baby pink now. Stupid cow!

42
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,000
I had matching accessories
and everything!

43
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,280
Mum, do I have to go shopping again?

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,440
My mother chose all my 21 dowry
suits herself. I never complained.

45
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,840
You are spoilt! Don't forget my dhania.
And more carrots. I'm making achar.

46
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,640
Oh, Mum, don't do pickle as well!

47
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,520
Am I asking you to make it?!

48
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,400
Hi, Pinks! Are you all right?

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,560
You haven't left everything
to the last minute, have you?

50
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,680
Yeah. One more day of freedom!

51
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,320
- Where did you get your contacts?
- Like 'em? They go with my hair.

52
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,680
My fiance don't like dyed hair.

53
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,400
Can't stand here all day. I got to
go to Ealing for my facial. Laters!

54
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,640
Bye, Pinks. Laters.

55
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,880
Stupid bitch! Why did she get
blue contacts? Now I can't wear mine!

56
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,040
I'd never wear that!

57
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,200
They're all the rage, poppet!

58
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,520
You blow 'em up, just like a lilo.

59
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,520
Look, this little pump comes free with it.

60
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,400
Pop it in the valve,
pump away, up it goes,

61
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,520
then slip it back in there...

62
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,920
..and boom! Cleavage! They're
perfect while you're still growing

63
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,760
'cause they lift you right there.

64
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,600
- Mum! God, you're so embarrassing!
- They make more of what you've got.

65
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,560
All the girls have bought one for
their daughters. The Fleur's pretty,

66
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,840
and the gel bra's a clever one -
no pumping, it's already in there.

67
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,920
Not the sports bras! They're
so plain! They don't enhance.

68
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,440
- No one's going to see them.
- It's not how they look,

69
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,600
it's how they make you feel.

70
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,720
I really like that lace lycra one.
Uh-oh, there's your mate.

71
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,960
I hope his mum wears a cardi
over her three stomachs tomorrow!

72
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,240
- Shut up! She's old.
- So?

73
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,360
All right, Jess? Hiya, Pinky.

74
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,760
May you have a long life,
my daughters!

75
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
- Getting ready for tomorrow?
- Yes, Massiji.

76
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,560
Mum's making samosas.

77
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,480
May God keep you and your husband
in endless happiness! And pray for me

78
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,960
that I get a lovely daughter-in-law
like you for my Tony.

79
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,240
Aw, thank you, Massiji! OK, bye!

80
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,560
- How was biology?
- Did you do the genetics one?

81
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,600
- Yes, she passed the gene to her son.
- I got that, too.

82
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,200
- Hope I get my grades for uni.
- Come on!

83
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,520
- Going to the park?
- I'll try.

84
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,480
Mum!

85
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,280
I found it! Come on, Jess!

86
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,840
There you go! Over here!

87
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,560
Rubbish! Come on, boys!

88
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,840
You're such an idiot, man!

89
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,640
- Jess! Fancy a quick game?
- I can't. My mum's waiting,

90
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,960
- my dad's on earlies at Heathrow.
- We really need you! Come on!

91
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,000
Come on!

92
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,000
Who does she think she is?
Beckham or what?

93
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,080
Can we chest it like him?

94
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,200
- Give it some bounce!
- Go on! Chest it!

95
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,480
Did that hurt, pretty boy?

96
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,080
I nearly scored from 25 yards today.
Bent it and everything.

97
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,240
I could have played all night.

98
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,120
It's not fair that boys never have
to come home and help.

99
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,280
If I had an arranged marriage,
would he let me play football?

100
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,440
Who are you talking to?

101
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,560
No one, Dad.

102
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,840
OK, Biji and her grandson
are staying in here for the wedding.

103
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,680
Why don't you put a nice picture
of beautiful sceneries

104
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,800
- instead of this bald man?
- Dad!

105
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,880
I'm going to change.
Come and help me out, OK?

106
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,880
..a beautiful Rolls Royce, you know?

107
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,200
I'll get one for your wedding, too,
if you like.

108
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,800
It will be your turn soon, eh?

109
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,120
Do you want a clean-shaven boy
like your sister

110
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,320
or a proper Sikh
with a full beard and a turban?

111
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,360
It's only our men that have
a big engine and full MOT, eh?

112
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,000
Nah, man, the alternator's gone
on the Merc!

113
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,280
Just do the Nissan.
I told you not to bother me!

114
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,440
It's my engagement, man!

115
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,760
Switch it off.

116
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,400
- He is so tick, man!
- Innit, innit? I know!

117
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,280
He's taking his shirt off!

118
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,960
A body like that needs
an X certificate warning!

119
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,920
And a lifetime guarantee!

120
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,040
- Yeah, man! Call Jess!
- Jess!

121
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,360
- Who's that with the gorgeous bod?
- The one with the six-pack.

122
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,360
- If he looks at me, I'll faint!
- What? Taz?

123
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,800
- Is that his name?
- Look at that kick!

124
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,520
He is so fly!

125
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,640
That is fine. That is so fine!

126
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,920
- Get your girlfriend!
- Jess!

127
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,200
Go on. Lover boy's calling you!

128
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,120
You know he's just my mate.
We're not all slags like you lot!

129
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,320
Bitch! Just 'cause she's still a V,
she thinks she's better than us!

130
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,240
At least she hasn't got off
with half of Hounslow like you two!

131
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,560
Who's that gori watching her?

132
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,560
Come on, Jess! It's all yours!

133
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,760
That was brilliant!
Do you play for any side?

134
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yeah, like whose?
Southall United Sari Squad?

135
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,400
I play for Hounslow Harriers Girls.
You should come and have a trial.

136
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,440
- A trial? Think I'm good enough?
- Yeah.

137
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,280
You're really good.
It's up to our coach,

138
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,720
but we could do with some new blood.

139
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,200
- That's brilliant!
- Do you swap shirts at the end?

140
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,560
And have a bath together?
Where's the soap?

141
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,680
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

142
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,840
Let's play football.

143
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,400
- I'm Jules.
- Jess.

144
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,880
Yes!

145
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,840
I want two groups of three.
Let's move!

146
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,080
- She better be serious.
- She's got balls.

147
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,440
- At least watch her.
- Hi.

148
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,480
- Where do you normally play?
- In the park.

149
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,240
I mean what position?

150
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,600
Sorry! I usually play all over,
but up front on the right is best.

151
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,080
- Get your boots on.
- I haven't got any.

152
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,120
Right, join in. Start warming up.

153
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,680
- Where shall I put this?
- Put it over here.

154
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,480
Jesus!

155
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,120
Pass it to Jules!

156
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,400
Brilliant!

157
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,240
- How did it feel out there?
- Really great!

158
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,080
I've never seen an Indian girl
into football.

159
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,680
- I didn't know about the girls' team.
- It's her fault.

160
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,800
When I played for the men's club,

161
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,080
she whined that there was no team
for her to play on.

162
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,640
I wasn't whining!

163
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,680
There was nothing for us girls.
There was junior boys stuff,

164
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,840
but when he busted his knee,
he set up a girls' side,

165
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,280
and he's been on my case ever since!

166
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,840
They made me start at the bottom.
You can't get much lower than her!

167
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,000
You're so full of it!

168
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,720
Nah, we get just as many trophies
as the men's side do.

169
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,840
So, does she pass?

170
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,560
- Are your folks up for it?
- Yeah, they're cool.

171
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,320
Suppose you'd better come back, then.

172
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,520
I've got to go and open the bar.
Some real work!

173
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,840
- He likes you.
- You think so?

174
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,560
He asked you back, didn't he?

175
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,920
- How long have you been playing?
- For ages, but just in the park.

176
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,240
- Nothing as serious as this.
- This, serious? It'll do for now.

177
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,040
- I want to play professionally.
- Wow! Can you do that?

178
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,720
Not really here,
but you can in America.

179
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,400
They've got a pro league
with new stadiums and everything.

180
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,000
Really?

181
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,680
I can't believe it!

182
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,200
It's a proper pitch with lights,
corner flags, changing rooms...

183
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,360
The coach likes me.

184
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,240
He really knows his stuff.

185
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,240
Must be gutted he can't play
with his injury and all.

186
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,280
Jules is so lucky! Her mum and dad
must really support her

187
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,240
to let her go all the way
to America to play.

188
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,440
I don't even know how to tell my mum
and dad about Hounslow Harriers.

189
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,040
- Oops!
- Oh, will you both pack it in!

190
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,560
Look at the state of my fuchsias!

191
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,000
When are you gonna realise you have
a daughter with breasts, not a son?

192
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,880
- Paula!
- No boy's gonna go out with a girl

193
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,240
- who's got bigger muscles than him!
- Leave her alone.

194
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,760
- I'm not gonna give it up!
- I saw Kevin with a blonde girl

195
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,640
and they weren't talking
about Match of the bleedin' Day!

196
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
He can shag whoever he bloody wants!

197
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,000
Honey, all I'm saying is
there is a reason why Sporty Spice

198
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,960
is the only one of them without a fella.

199
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,880
- Sweetheart...
- Why don't you get off her flamin' back?

200
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,640
If she'd rather play football than chase
boys, I'm over the moon about that.

201
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,560
They're a bit tatty, but they'll do.
Here's a kit. You can get it dirty.

202
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,440
- Can't I wear my tracksuit bottoms?
- No.

203
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,600
Shit!

204
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,880
Jess, get changed over here.

205
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,840
- You've met our captain, Mel.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

206
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,680
Ready for a proper match?

207
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,560
Chiswick next. Best defensive
record in the division.

208
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,760
- They're due for a good stuffing.
- Absolutely!

209
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,960
We need some pace up front. Jules
could do with some decent service!

210
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,680
Welcome to the Harriers.

211
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,200
Painters and decorators are in.

212
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,000
Jules, take over the warm-up.

213
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,640
Come on, girls, keep going!

214
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,320
Heads up!

215
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,800
Jess, what's going on?

216
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,360
It looks awful.

217
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,160
- It's why I can't wear shorts ever.
- Jesus!

218
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,280
That's a stunner!

219
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,160
I thought I had a bad one on my knee
but yours is gorgeous.

220
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,000
Look, don't worry about it. No one's
gonna care once you're out there.

221
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,960
- What happened?
- You don't want to know.

222
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,080
Look...

223
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Two operations later and it's still useless.

224
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,320
Does yours affect your game?

225
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,480
Nah, it just looks awful.

226
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,640
I was eight. My mum was working
overtime at Heathrow

227
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,520
and I was trying
to cook beans on toast.

228
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,200
When I jumped up to the grill to get
the toast, my trousers caught alight,

229
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,360
so my sister put me in the bath,

230
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,480
poured cold water over me and pulled
them off but half my skin came off, too.

231
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,320
Sorry.

232
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,240
I know.
Put me off beans on toast for life.

233
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,640
Come on. Mine stopped me
from playing outright, yours doesn't.

234
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,720
- No more dawdling.
- Sorry about your knee.

235
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,320
Yeah, yeah. I'm a right sob story,
aren't I? Come on!

236
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,440
I want to see some sweat on you!

237
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,080
Well, she's all you'd ever want

238
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,600
She's the kind they'd like to fllaunt
and take to dinner

239
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,440
And she always knows her place
She's got style, she's got grace

240
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,520
She's a winner

241
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,000
She's a lady!

242
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,880
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

243
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,600
She's a lady

244
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,040
I'm talking about my little lady

245
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,680
Oh, whoa, whoa, she's a lady! Lady!

246
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,200
Well, she's a lady!

247
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,800
- Hey, Tony!
- Are you here for fantasy football?

248
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,400
- You look like a pro!
- It's brilliant. They're a top team

249
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,720
- and the coach is ace.
- Excellent!

250
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,960
- What's that?
- Haven't you seen a burn before?

251
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,440
- That's disgusting, man!
- Back off, you wanker!

252
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,000
No, it's fine.

253
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,440
At least I can still skin you alive!

254
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,400
The skill, the skill!

255
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,280
The skill!

256
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,480
That's not fair!

257
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,480
He touched you all over!
Put his hands on your bare legs!

258
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,040
You're not a young girl any more!
And showing the world your scar!

259
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,040
Jessie, now that your sister's engaged,
it's different.

260
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,240
- You know how people talk.
- She's getting married, not me!

261
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,240
I was married at your age!
You won't even learn to cook dhal!

262
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,840
- I'm not playing with boys any more.
- Good! End of matter!

263
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,440
I'm in a girls' team, playing proper
matches. The coach said I could go far.

264
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,800
Go far? Go far to where?

265
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,720
We let you play all you wanted
when you were young, huh?

266
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,760
- You've played enough.
- That's not fair! He selected me!

267
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,960
He?! She said it was girls!

268
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,960
- The coach, Joe.
- See how she lies?

269
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,000
I don't want you running around
half naked in front of men, huh?

270
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,440
Look how dark you've become,
playing in the sun!

271
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,280
- But I'm really good!
- Who will want a daughter-in-law

272
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,520
who can kick a football all day

273
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,640
but can't make round chapattis?

274
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,600
Now exams are over, you'll learn
full Punjabi dinner, meat and vegetarian!

275
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,720
- But, Dad!
- No! This is where you spoil her!

276
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,680
This is how it started with your niece,

277
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,920
and she ran off to become
a model wearing small, small skirts!

278
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,120
- She's a fashion designer!
- She's divorced!

279
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,720
Cast off after three years of being
married to a white boy with blue hair!

280
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,200
Her poor mother hasn't been able
to set foot in that temple since.

281
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,280
I don't want the shame on my family.

282
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,920
That's it! No more football!

283
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,280
Jessie, your mother is right.

284
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,640
It's not nice. You must start
behaving like a proper woman. OK?

285
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,000
Anything I want
is just not Indian enough for 'em!

286
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,440
I never bunked off school. I don't
wear make-up or tight clothes.

287
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,480
- They don't see that!
- Parents never see the good things.

288
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,600
Anyone can cook aloo gobi,

289
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,320
- but who can bend a ball like Beckham?
- Just play and don't tell them.

290
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,800
Pinky's been sneaking off for years
to see Teets.

291
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,680
What your parents don't know
won't hurt.

292
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,520
Why should I have to lie? It's not like
I'm sleeping around with anyone!

293
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,840
Jess! Hello!

294
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,640
I thought you'd be here.

295
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,520
This is Tony.
This is Jules from the team.

296
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,120
Jess is well made up with your team.

297
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,000
We've got high hopes for her,
especially me.

298
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,800
My mum doesn't want me to play
any more.

299
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,160
That's bollocks!
My mum's never wanted me to play.

300
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
You can't take no for an answer.

301
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,840
Yeah, but my sister's getting married
so Mum and Dad are stressed out.

302
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,160
I won't be able to get
to training and matches.

303
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,440
Come on, Jess.
You can't leave me alone out there.

304
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,120
Joe has an American scout coming over.
Don't worry about your mum.

305
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,240
Just say you got a summer job.

306
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,520
I could put in a good word for you
at HMV with me. So...

307
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,440
..now we've got that sorted,
show me what your fella can do!

308
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,800
- He's not my boyfriend!
- I'm not her boyfriend!

309
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,160
Jess, come on! Are you playing?

310
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,360
Jessie! Breakfast!

311
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,440
Nah, I'm in a hurry!

312
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,480
You can't go to work
on an empty stomach.

313
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,600
Where's my keys?

314
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,240
- Jessie!
- No, I'm late, Mum.

315
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,880
Bye!

316
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,720
Hush now, child

317
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,840
And don't you cry

318
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,240
Your flolks might understand you

319
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,440
By and by

320
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,280
Just move on up

321
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,480
Towards your destination

322
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,760
Though you may flind

323
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,440
From time to time

324
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,400
Complications

325
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,960
Bite your lip

326
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,440
And take a trip

327
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,840
Though there may be
wet roads ahead

328
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,520
And you cannot slip

329
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,680
Just move on up

330
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,320
For peace you will flind

331
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,320
Into the steeple
ofl beautiflul people

332
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,160
Where there's only one kind

333
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,680
So hush now, child

334
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,920
And don't you cry

335
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,480
Your flolks might understand you

336
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,120
By and by

337
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,240
Move on up

338
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,520
And keep on wishing

339
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,920
Remember your dream
is your only scheme

340
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,560
So keep on pushing

341
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Just move on up

342
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,400
Move on up!

343
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,720
Get off me, man!

344
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,880
No one can see us.

345
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,160
Yeah?

346
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,280
Mum!

347
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,440
No, no, nothing,
I'm just at work, innit?

348
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,600
Yeah, I know Poli's
coming to do the suits.

349
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,840
So Jess can get the tube, innit?

350
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,840
Yeah, all right, I'll pick her up.

351
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,560
I've got to go, Mum,
someone's coming.

352
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,000
My mum and dad ain't got a clue.

353
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,160
- They don't know you've been playing?
- No.

354
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,280
- Where do they think you are?
- Working at HMV.

355
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,160
- That's not on.
- Indian girls don't play football!

356
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,080
It's not just an Indian thing.
How many people support us?

357
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,160
Are you promised to someone?

358
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,680
Nah. My sister's getting married.
It's a love match.

359
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,680
- What's that mean?
- It's not arranged.

360
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,720
- So, could you choose a white boy?
- White, no,

361
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,600
black, definitely not, a Muslim, eh-eh!

362
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,800
- You'll marry an Indian, then!
- Probably.

363
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,600
- How can you stand it?
- It's just culture.

364
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,720
Why sleep with boys
you aren't going to marry?

365
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,080
- That's the best bit!
- Yeah, you should know!

366
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,080
Are you ready to go?
See you slags later!

367
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,280
It's only me.

368
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,720
Mum, I'm starving. I worked
through my lunch hour today.

369
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,920
Where's Pinky?
She was supposed to pick you up

370
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,200
so you wouldn't be late for Poli.

371
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,160
Pinky, why didn't you pick
your sister up from work, huh?

372
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,440
I went but the manager said
I'd just missed her.

373
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,560
OK, Poli's on her way.

374
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,720
I'll make you girls some tea.

375
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,000
- Who is he, then?
- Who?

376
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,160
You must think I've got shit for brains,
lying about a job and that!

377
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Don't tell Mum and Dad.
I kept Teet a secret for you.

378
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,920
- He's not a Muslim, is he?
- Ssh!

379
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,360
I've been playing football
for a women's team.

380
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,520
Huh? It's worse than I thought!

381
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:59,240
- It's a tournament with real matches!
- What is wrong with you, Jess?

382
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,520
At least lie for something good!

383
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,840
Don't you want a boyfriend
like everyone else?

384
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,000
You're quite pretty. Do your hair,
some make-up, you'd look all right.

385
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,160
Leave her alone. I never wore
make-up until after I was married.

386
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,840
Jessie's a good girl.
She helped me wash the net curtains

387
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,720
and she made lovely aloo gobi
last week.

388
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,640
Waist 25...under bust 28...

389
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,640
- Bust...
- Eh, that's too tight and rude!

390
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,880
No, Mum, I want my choli more fitted.
That's the style, innit?

391
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,000
- 34 and a half.
- No, tighter!

392
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,760
- OK, 34!
- How are you going to breathe?

393
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,360
Mum, why do I have to wear
a sari? It will just fall down!

394
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,320
Your first sari
is when you become a woman.

395
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,440
Sari blouse and petticoat.

396
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,920
- So...bust...31...
- That's too tight. I want it looser.

397
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,400
Dressed in a sack,
who's going to notice you, huh?

398
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,840
Don't worry. In one of our designs,

399
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,800
even these mosquito bites
will look like juicy mangoes!

400
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,040
Under the bust, 27.

401
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,120
The waist, 27.

402
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,520
I need to buy shoes
to go with the sari and the suits.

403
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,680
- Come again?
- She's coming into line now!

404
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,720
I can pay for one pair.
Can you pay for the other?

405
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,320
You need one black and one white
to go with everything.

406
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I know I make mistakes

407
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,080
I will have to live and learn

408
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,320
Sometimes you play with flire

409
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,720
And sometimes you get burned

410
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,880
I have my dream to live

411
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,040
Following that star

412
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,640
It doesn 't matter how long it takes

413
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,320
It doesn 't matter how flar

414
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,640
No time flor make-believing

415
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,720
And it's too late to turn back now

416
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah

417
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,600
I've been dreaming about it

418
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,000
I can 't live without it

419
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,480
I've got to flind my own way

420
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,360
I'm not changing my mind now

421
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,160
Or looking behind now

422
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,160
This is my Independence

423
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,680
Day

424
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,800
My Independence Day!

425
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,600
- Can you change the channel, please?
- It's nearly the end.

426
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,760
Mum, she's back!

427
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,640
You've been gone all day
for two pairs of shoes! Come here!

428
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,000
It's not that late.
I was looking at handbags, too.

429
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,800
- Let's see 'em!
- Not yet. I'll try them with the suits.

430
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,920
Cigarette?

431
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,120
- Have you been smoking?
- No!

432
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,760
Cigarette!

433
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,680
I needed the loo
so I went into a pub with my friend.

434
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,760
I had a coke. Smell my breath!

435
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,120
She might be right.

436
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,480
These don't have a heel!
How will they fall nicely with your sari?

437
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,080
I'll take them back.

438
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,200
Football shoes!

439
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,520
But you can't give 'em back.

440
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,800
- I need shoes for the wedding now.
- Come over to mine. I'll sort you out.

441
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,920
Come on, girls! Wake up!

442
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,720
God! My mum had a fit
when she saw the boots!

443
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,000
And I smelt like a bleedin' ashtray!

444
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,600
I had to clean all the big saucepans.

445
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,160
Yak, yak! Jess!

446
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,120
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, coach.

447
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,720
Am I interrupting your conversation?

448
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,320
- No, coach.
- Good. Five more laps round the pitch!

449
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,400
- Elbows to knees as you go!
- Joe, that is totally out of order!

450
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,080
Hey! I don't remember telling
the rest of you to stop!

451
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,880
Move it! You're doing very well.
Keep it up for another two minutes.

452
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,040
Good, Mackie! Good, Sally!

453
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,160
Excellent! Excellent!

454
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,280
Jess! You can stop now!

455
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,120
Stop! You're doing yourself an injury!

456
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,320
- I'm OK. I've just got one more lap.
- I said stop!

457
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,240
Let's have a look at you.

458
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,360
- It's nothing!
- Sit down. Let me decide if it's nothing.

459
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,320
Why didn't you tell me you'd twisted it?

460
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,080
I didn't want you to think
I'm not as strong as the others.

461
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,120
That's stupid, Jess.

462
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,400
Look, my dad was my coach. Scouts
told him that I was too slight to play,

463
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,080
so he kept pushing me.
That's how I screwed my knee.

464
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,880
Your dad made you?

465
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,960
I wanted to show him I wasn't soft,
so I tried to play injured.

466
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,520
- He was a bastard anyway.
- You shouldn't say that about your dad.

467
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,640
You don't know my dad.

468
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,280
All right. Come on.

469
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,120
Good. Now put your weight on me.

470
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,520
There you are.

471
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,480
Oh, my God!

472
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,480
Just give 'em back after the wedding.

473
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,680
My mum loves them.
She stuck the bows on herself.

474
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,760
- Thanks. You sure she won't miss 'em?
- Nah.

475
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,080
Listen...
I hope Joe wasn't too hard on you.

476
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,800
Some of the girls think he's too strict.

477
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,160
No, he was really nice,
just really professional.

478
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,120
I love that picture. It was
after we beat Millwall last year.

479
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,000
You got to see this. It's wicked!

480
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,880
W.U.S.A. soccer!

481
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,640
-Wow!
- W.U.S.A.

482
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,760
Incredible!
We've nothing like that over here.

483
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,960
Goal! Mia Hamm,
world footballer of the year!

484
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Milbrett makes a run.

485
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,000
She shoots! Goal!
Tiffany Milbrett scores again!

486
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,240
Lily strikes... Save!

487
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,880
Brandi Chastain!

488
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,240
Saved! Smith beats the keeper!

489
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,560
Goal for Kelly Smith,
the England international!

490
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,400
When are you going to tell
your parents about your game?

491
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,840
- I don't know.
- You can't keep lying. You're too good.

492
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,520
- Cooey!
- Hide the shoes!

493
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,080
- Sweetheart!
- Up here, Mum.

494
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,920
Oh, it's hot out there!

495
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,080
Oh! Got company!

496
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,400
- Hello, love.
- Mum, this is Jess.

497
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,560
Jess?

498
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,480
Is that Indian?

499
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,000
It's really Jesminder,
but only my mum calls me that.

500
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,480
Oh, that's nice. Jesmin-dah.

501
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
Lovely!

502
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,320
Well, Jesmin-dah, I bet your room
at home doesn't look like this!

503
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,600
- Big butch women on the wall!
- Thanks, Mum, I'm not old like you!

504
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,200
Jess, I hope you can teach
my daughter a bit about your culture,

505
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,200
including respect
for elders and the like, eh?

506
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,840
Cheeky madam!

507
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,800
Well, Jess...

508
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,680
I expect your parents are fixing you up
with a handsome young doctor soon.

509
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,880
- Pretty girl like you...
- Mum! Stop embarrassing yourself!

510
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,000
What?

511
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,920
Just being friendly!
You don't mind, do you, love?

512
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,800
Now, are you a friend
from school or work?

513
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,800
She's a footballer.
She's on the team with me.

514
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,520
"Jesmin-dah"!

515
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,840
Did you see her face, though?!

516
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,040
- Juliet!
- Jesmin-dah! What WAS that?

517
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,480
- Are you all right?
- Oh, Jesus!

518
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,000
Jules...

519
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,280
You know Joe, do you like him?

520
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,040
Nah, he'd get sacked if he was
caught shagging one of his players.

521
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,760
Really?

522
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,200
I wish I could find a bloke like him.

523
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,920
Everyone I know's a prat. They think
girls can't play as well as them,

524
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,840
except Joe, of course.

525
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,120
Yeah, I hope I marry
an Indian boy like him, too.

526
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,840
- What?
- I'm sorry!

527
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,360
Shut up!

528
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:17,240
We're not trying to cause trouble.
We felt it our duty to tell you.

529
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,160
You know how hard it is
for our children here.

530
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,200
Sometimes they misjudge and start
behaving like the kids here.

531
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,720
All I know is that children
are a map of their parents.

532
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,480
- You stupid flippin' cow!
- You've ruined your sister's life!

533
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,520
- Happy now?
- The wedding's off 'cause of you!

534
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,960
- Me? Why?
- They saw you being filthy

535
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,520
with an English boy!

536
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,720
- I wasn't with any English boy!
- You were at a bus stop kissing him!

537
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,760
Why didn't you do it in secret
like everyone else?

538
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,080
Kissing? Me? A boy?!

539
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,800
- You're all bloody mad!
- Jesminder, don't swear!

540
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,800
I was at the 120 bus stop today
but with Juliet. My friend.

541
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,240
She's a girl, and we weren't kissing
or anything for God's sake!

542
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,160
- Swear by Babaji.
- I swear on Babaji's name.

543
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,160
Sometimes these English girls
have such short hair...

544
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,280
You just can't tell.

545
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,760
They must have made a mistake.

546
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,560
His parents are just making an excuse.

547
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,840
We were never good enough for them.

548
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,840
No, I bet she was with some dykey
girl from her football team!

549
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,600
She's still playing! She ain't
got no job! She's been lying!

550
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,200
Why have I two deceiving daughters?

551
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,560
- What did I do wrong in my past life?
- But she's ruined my life!

552
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,840
I knew you were sneaking out
with that good-for-nothing Teetu as well!

553
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,880
- Well, just talk to them, innit?
- I'll come and talk to your parents.

554
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,160
Jules, come here to me.

555
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,040
- Where's your mate?
- I don't know.

556
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,880
This is the second training session
in a row she's missed.

557
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,000
It's not like her.

558
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,880
Did she say she was unhappy
with anything?

559
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,160
Her parents didn't know she was
on the team. Maybe they found out.

560
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,160
What? She said her folks were up for it.

561
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,520
I've told her to tell them
but she won't listen to me.

562
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,200
I'll get it!

563
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,040
- Yeah?
- Hello.

564
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,480
Thanks, Jess.

565
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,720
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this,

566
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,160
but I wanted to talk to you in person.

567
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,080
I found out today that you didn't
know Jess was playing for us.

568
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,600
No, we didn't.

569
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,360
I apologise. If I'd known, I would
have encouraged Jess to tell you

570
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,120
because she's got tremendous potential.

571
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:13,120
We know better our daughter's potential.
Jess has no time for games.

572
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,680
- She'll start university soon.
- But playing for the team is an honour!

573
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,680
What bigger honour is there

574
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,600
- than respecting your elders?
- When I was a teenager in Nairobi,

575
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,320
I was the best fast bowler in our school.

576
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,440
Our team even won the East African Cup.

577
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,400
But when I came to this country, nothing.

578
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,880
I was not allowed to play in any team,

579
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,960
and the bloody goras in their
clubhouses made fun of my turban

580
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,640
and sent me off packing!

581
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,760
I'm sorry, Mr Bhamra...

582
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,000
-..but now it's...
- Now what?

583
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,800
Our boys aren't in the football leagues.

584
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,920
You think they will let our girls?

585
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,560
I don't want you to build up
Jesminder's hopes.

586
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,480
She will only end up
disappointed like me.

587
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,080
It's changing now. Nasser Hussein
is captain of the English cricket team

588
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,400
- and he's Asian.
- Muslim families are different.

589
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,680
Oh, Mum!

590
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,080
We've been invited to play
in Germany this Saturday.

591
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,400
- It's a shame you'll miss it.
- Wow! Germany!

592
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,720
I can see what you're up against, but
parents don't always know what's best.

593
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,000
They're all here.

594
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,840
They're all in, yeah?

595
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,600
Shit!

596
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,800
- You know the score, yeah?
- Yeah, call them twice a day.

597
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,960
My sister's covering for me.

598
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,840
- We're supposed to be at my cousin's.
- I didn't hear that!

599
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,080
Uh-huh, make me tonight

600
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,960
Tonight

601
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,080
Make it right

602
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:28,680
Uh-huh, make me tonight

603
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,840
Tonight

604
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,600
Tonight

605
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,880
Oh, oh-hoh, make it
magniflicent...

606
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,800
Jess! Cross it, Jess!

607
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,680
Good luck.

608
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,520
Go on, Jess, you can do this!

609
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,800
Mum, we're fine. We're cooking...

610
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,200
- Pasta!
-..pasta! I'd better go...

611
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,840
Pinky's burning it!
OK, say hi to Dad, yeah?

612
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,000
OK. Bye, Mum.

613
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,600
Good. They sound happy.
Pinky will meet someone new

614
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,480
and Jessie will forget
all about this football nonsense.

615
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,120
The dinner's ready?

616
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,400
But let me wash up first.

617
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,080
Call her back in Croydon.
I want to speak to them.

618
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,960
- I said I want to speak to them!
- OK, baba.

619
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,800
I didn't bring anything for a club.

620
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,120
I didn't know they wanted to take us
clubbing. I bet it's to gloat!

621
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,800
Mel? We need some help.

622
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,760
Jess!

623
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,880
Oh, wow! You look good!

624
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,640
- Does she look good?
- Yeah! You've done a good job!

625
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,240
Let's get a taxi.

626
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,720
Hello, darling!

627
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,320
- How's Jules?
- I'm fine. How are you?

628
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,960
- Are you gonna dance with me, then?
- No.

629
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,000
Come on! Dance with me!
Oh, you're such a wuss!

630
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,320
I'm sorry I missed that penalty, coach.

631
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:25,080
It's OK. Losing to the Jerries on penalties
comes natural to you English!

632
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,240
You're part of a tradition now.

633
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,480
Enough about football.
You're dancing with me!

634
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,640
- No!
- Go on!

635
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,800
I'm not taking no for an answer!

636
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,680
I turn to you

637
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,360
Like a fllower
leaning towards the sun

638
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,880
I turn to you

639
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,120
'Cause you're the only one

640
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,240
Who can turn me around

641
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,000
When I'm upside down

642
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,680
Down, down

643
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,680
I turn to you
I turn to you

644
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,280
When my insides are racked
with anxiety

645
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,840
You have the touch
that will quiet me

646
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,840
You lift my spirit
You melt the ice

647
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,480
The ice, the ice

648
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,880
When I need inspiration
when I need advice

649
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,880
I turn to you

650
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,680
Like a fllower
leaning towards the sun

651
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,560
I turn to you

652
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,800
'Cause you're the only one

653
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,280
Who can turn me around...

654
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,600
Jess!

655
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,920
Whoa! Steady on there, young one!

656
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,080
Are you all right?

657
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,240
Are you sure?

658
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,680
Gosh!

659
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,160
I only had a couple of wines!

660
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,920
Oh, my head!

661
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,720
- It's too smoky in there.
- Yeah.

662
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,200
I wish I

663
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,360
Could right now

664
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,920
Wish that I could show you how...

665
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,640
That was so brilliant
the way you came to my house.

666
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,440
You were brave enough to face my mum!

667
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,560
Your dad can't be as mad as her!

668
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,960
Your mam's a barrel of laughs
compared to me dad!

669
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,080
I don't need to feel close
to my family, Jess.

670
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,360
I don't need you to feel sorry for me.

671
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,160
You bitch!

672
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,280
Shit! Jules.

673
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,800
Jules!

674
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,360
You all right, Jess?

675
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,560
Is that your mum and dad?

676
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,040
What haven't we done
for these girls, huh?

677
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,200
We bought a car for Pinky.

678
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,600
Jessie wanted computer,

679
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,720
music centre, TV, video, huh?

680
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,680
Pinks...

681
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,880
How do you know Teets is the one?

682
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,520
I just know.

683
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:13,120
When you're in love with someone,
you'd do anything for that person.

684
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,480
Pinks, do you think Mum and Dad
would still speak to me

685
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,640
if I ever brought home a gora?

686
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,560
- Who?!
- No one. I'm just saying.

687
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,400
It's that coach! I knew something
was up when he turned up here!

688
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,600
- Nothing's happened.
- Well, make sure it doesn't, all right?

689
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,000
You can marry anyone you want.
It's fine at first when you're in love

690
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,040
but do you want to be stared at
at every family do

691
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,480
because you married the English bloke?

692
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,920
He's Irish.

693
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:54,440
Well, they look the bloody same to
them, innit? Why go to so much grief

694
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,320
when there's so many good-looking
Indian boys to marry?

695
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,120
They wear good clothes,

696
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,560
got flashy jobs and even know
how to cook and wash up.

697
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,800
Tony's been mad on you for ages!

698
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,880
Jess?

699
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,920
Was that the club chairman?

700
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,800
Yeah. They told me
they're considering me

701
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
as assistant coach
for the men's side next year.

702
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,320
That's great! Congratulations.

703
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:16,600
Probably won't get it.
Better not to count on anything.

704
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,720
Well, you deserve it.

705
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:24,280
- I really wanted to say...
- I've already forgotten about it.

706
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,480
Yeah, good. Me, too.

707
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:34,640
Your parents didn't look too pleased
yesterday. Have you come to tell me

708
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,800
you're off the team for good?

709
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:42,120
It's not fair. I'm either going to
let the team down or piss them off,

710
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,600
and I don't want to upset anyone.

711
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,440
Why are they so frightened
to let you play?

712
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,960
They want to protect me.

713
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,160
From what?

714
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,480
This is taking me away
from everything they know.

715
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:04,240
Whose life are you living, Jess?
If you try pleasing 'em for ever,

716
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,280
you're gonna end up blaming 'em.

717
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,920
What, like you?

718
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,000
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're right.

719
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,800
I stopped talking to my dad because
we had nothing to talk about.

720
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,240
Spent a year getting pissed

721
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,720
trying to forget about the game,
but I couldn't.

722
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,280
Yeah, but I can't just stop talking
to them, like you.

723
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,360
I don't talk to my dad

724
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,360
because I know what he'd say.

725
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,760
He'd piss himself if he knew
I was coaching girls!

726
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,840
How do you know that he wouldn't be
proud that you didn't just give up?

727
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,720
You should be proud
of what you've given all of us.

728
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,240
Then why are you giving up?

729
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,920
- Jesmin-dah, isn't it?
- Jesminder.

730
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,400
Jesminder. I made
a lovely curry the other day!

731
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,680
Oh, you still not up?
Guess who's come to see you.

732
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,960
It's your Indian friend, from football.

733
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,480
Jules has been ever so down
since you lost in Germany.

734
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:39,440
Maybe you can cheer her up.
Want some tea? I've made cheese straws

735
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,320
with real Gruyere.

736
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,760
It's OK. Jess won't be staying long.

737
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,600
Well...

738
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,000
..just give us a shout downstairs

739
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,440
if there's anything
you two fancy, all right?

740
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,160
Look, I feel really bad
about what happened.

741
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,280
Yeah, well, you should.

742
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:15,160
I'm sorry. I don't want you
to be in a strop with me.

743
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,800
I'm not in a strop!

744
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,320
Look, it was a mistake.
I didn't know what I was doing!

745
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,160
I can't believe you kissed him!

746
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,720
I didn't!

747
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,440
Yeah, right!

748
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,600
Jess, I know what I saw!
You knew he was off limits!

749
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:42,760
Don't pretend to be so innocent.
You knew exactly how I felt about him!

750
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,200
I didn't know
you were in love with him!

751
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,600
You don't know the meaning of love!
You've really hurt me, Jess!

752
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,080
That's all there is to it!
You've betrayed me!

753
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,320
So that's it?

754
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,840
Yeah, that's it. Bye!

755
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,520
Goodbye, Mrs Paxton.

756
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,680
What's going on?

757
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,240
That is why she's been
so depressed lately!

758
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,560
'Cause that Jess broke her heart!

759
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,720
She's in love!

760
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,880
With a girl!

761
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,040
You're jumping
to all the wrong conclusions.

762
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,600
But I heard her!

763
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:38,160
No wonder she never looked twice
at that Kevin or brought any boys home!

764
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,920
I tried to get her nice clothes.

765
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,560
You know, we've had some lovely
prints in this summer -

766
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,800
you know, in swimwear
and sarongs and that -

767
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,640
but she never wants
to go shopping with me!

768
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:02,600
It was terrible what they did
to that George Michael!

769
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:07,320
Going on about him and his
private business in the papers like that!

770
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,160
Oh, no!

771
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:16,200
George Michael is still a superstar
and you still listen to Wham!.

772
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,720
Do you fancy me, Tony?

773
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,560
- I like you, yeah...
- Maybe we can go out, then, yeah?

774
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,600
- Jess, what's going on?
- I think I need an Indian boyfriend.

775
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,600
What's going on?
You're acting all weird.

776
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,720
Sorry.

777
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,160
You know my coach, yeah?

778
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,840
Yeah.

779
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,200
I nearly kissed him in Germany.

780
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,560
Wow! And that's why you need
an Indian boyfriend?

781
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,760
Well, Jules likes him, too,
and now she hates me.

782
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,160
Look, Jess, you can't plan
who you fall for. It just happens.

783
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,560
- Look at Posh and Becks.
- Well, Beckham's the best.

784
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,160
- I like Beckham, too.
- Of course you do.

785
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,560
No one can cross a ball
or bend it like Beckham.

786
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,960
No, Jess.

787
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,360
I really like Beckham.

788
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,320
What, you mean...?

789
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,600
But you're Indian!

790
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,560
I haven't told anyone.

791
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,120
God, what's your mum gonna say?!

792
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,680
My sister thinks you're mad about me!

793
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,840
I am!

794
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,000
I just don't want to marry you.

795
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,520
What would those tossers
say if they knew?

796
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,040
Jess, you're not going to tell anyone?

797
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:04,120
'Course not. It's OK, Tony.
I mean, it's OK with me.

798
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:08,560
Yeah, well, you fancying
your gora coach is OK with me.

799
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,440
Besides...

800
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,160
he's quite fit!

801
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:23,520
Be back by three.
I can't keep 'em at the temple all day.

802
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,200
I owe you big time!

803
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,920
- Go to bed.
- Bring me back some langar.

804
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:32,200
We're going to pray to God
to give you both some sense, not get food!

805
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,320
Red alert, red alert,
it's a catastrophe

806
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,760
But don't worry

807
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,400
Don't panic

808
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,320
Ain't nothing going on
but history...

809
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,320
Honestly, Dad, I'll go and get it.

810
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,640
And the music
keeps on playing on and on...

811
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,280
Jessie, it's only me.

812
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:24,440
And the music
keeps on playing on and on...

813
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,000
Jessie? Jessie?

814
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,640
Red alert, red alert,
it's a catastrophe

815
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,120
But don't worry...

816
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,960
They don't all look like lezzies,
do they?

817
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,240
Check out the boobs on the captain!

818
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,400
Jeez, man, they must get in the way!

819
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,920
She's lucky she ain't knocked
herself out with them!

820
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,080
Why can't you lot
just see them as footballers?

821
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,400
What?

822
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,440
To the side! To the side!

823
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,440
Come on! Move it!

824
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,440
Down one-nil. Come on!

825
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,360
Over here! Over here! Come on!

826
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,080
Go on, Jess!

827
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,520
Jules! Over! Jules!

828
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,040
Come on, Harriers!

829
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,240
Over here, Jules!

830
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,120
Go on, Jess!

831
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,000
Go on! Go on!

832
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,840
- What you playing at?
- Piss off, Paki!

833
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,840
- Go away! Number 7, come here.
- What's the matter with you, ref?

834
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:46,640
- Violent conduct towards a player.
- No! You can't do that!

835
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:50,000
You haven't seen any of it,
have ya?

836
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,000
It's out of order!

837
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,760
She is so hard!

838
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,840
Oh, man! Unlucky, Tony, mate!

839
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,200
What the hell's wrong
with you, Bhamra?

840
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,360
I don't ever want to see anything
like that from you ever again!

841
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:13,800
We're lucky they're not suspending
players from this tournament!

842
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:18,000
Excellent! We've got QPR in
the final. Three cheers - hip, hip!

843
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,640
- Hurray!
- Hip, hip!

844
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,280
- Hurray!
- Hip, hip!

845
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,080
- Hurray!
- Brilliant!

846
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:33,720
Why did you yell at me like that?
You knew the ref was out of order!

847
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,960
- You could have cost us the tournament.
- But it wasn't my fault!

848
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:41,160
- You didn't have to shout at me!
- I'm your coach.

849
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:44,320
I have to treat you
the same as everyone else.

850
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,320
Look, Jess, I saw it.

851
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:54,480
She fouled you. She tugged your shirt.
You over-reacted, that's all.

852
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,920
That's not all! She called me a Paki,

853
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:01,040
but you wouldn't understand
what that feels like, would you?

854
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,240
Jess, I'm Irish.

855
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:07,360
Of course I'd understand
what that feels like.

856
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,000
Jesminder?

857
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,080
Oh, here he is.

858
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,400
Tejinder's mother and father
have come to speak to us.

859
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,080
- Are you well?
- Thank you, yes.

860
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,040
What's happening?

861
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,720
Teet's mum and dad
have come to eat dirt.

862
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,720
Stupid cow! I don't know
who she thinks she is in that sari!

863
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:53,160
No mother can stand by
and watch her son go through this.

864
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:57,040
Well, our Pinky didn't come
out of her room for days.

865
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,320
- She was crying.
- Our Teetu also.

866
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,880
For days he ate and drank nothing!

867
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,520
All right. Thank you for coming.

868
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,280
Thanks, Dad!

869
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,360
I'm getting married!

870
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,800
We'll give them a wedding party
they'll never forget!

871
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,360
Find out when the hall is free.

872
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:47,440
Jessie, get the old wedding cards.
We'll change the dates by hand.

873
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,720
My name is Mohan Singh Bhamra.

874
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,680
..and paneer tikka. We'll show them
we're not poor people!

875
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,680
Will Sunday the 25th be OK?

876
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,720
- The 25th?
- There's a cancellation.

877
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,640
No, we need more time.

878
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:07,240
Hold on, please. The 25th is
the only available date. After that,

879
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,880
nothing's available for five months.

880
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,640
I can't wait that long!

881
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:15,240
OK, let's do it
before something else goes wrong!

882
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,960
But, Dad, the 25th...

883
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,760
No, that was not for you.

884
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,760
Oh, I'm so excited!

885
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,400
Your sister needs you.

886
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,400
Mel said you wanted to see me.

887
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,680
It's about Jess.

888
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,600
I don't want to talk about Germany, Joe.

889
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,960
- Listen...
- Whatever! I'm over it!

890
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:15,200
I don't know why I was surprised!
You only think about yourself!

891
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,320
Everyone knows
you're leaving us next season!

892
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,080
- Nothing's been decided.
- Bollocks!

893
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:25,760
You've already lied about the
American scout. He's not coming, is he?

894
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:30,440
You can't bear the idea of anyone
else making it because you can't!

895
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,600
He's coming to the final.

896
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,680
What?

897
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,200
He saw you play in Germany.

898
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,240
I thought...

899
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,400
Don't worry about it.

900
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,240
Jess!

901
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,360
We all missed you at training today.

902
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:21,920
Especially Joe.

903
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,360
He told me what happened
with your dad.

904
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,880
He did?

905
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,440
Yeah.

906
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,680
He's worried he's gotten you
into even more trouble.

907
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,240
I'm really in the shit.

908
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,880
Dad hasn't talked to me since.

909
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:45,200
He'll never let me go back
to join the team.

910
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,480
But you can't miss the final.

911
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:51,080
Jess, there's gonna be
an American scout there.

912
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:54,840
I can't. It's the same day
as my sister's wedding.

913
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,960
Oh, shit!

914
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,280
Well, can't you get away for a bit?

915
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:03,840
- You don't understand.
- If you give up football now,

916
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:07,320
- what will you have to give up next?
- Don't rub it in!

917
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,440
You came here because you need me
if that bloody scout shows up.

918
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:15,200
Look... I came here
'cause Joe was worried about you.

919
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:19,160
I'll tell him he's wasting his bloody time!

920
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,640
The teriyaki sauce is the goalkeeper.

921
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,640
The posh French mustard is the defender.

922
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,680
- The salt is the attacker.
- The sea salt?

923
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,800
The sea salt is the attacker.

924
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,360
Now, when the ball's played forward,

925
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:42,480
the sea salt has to be level
with the mustard. Hello, darling.

926
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:45,360
Now concentrate. Offside, onside.

927
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:49,040
- Offside, onside.
- What are you doing?

928
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:53,320
Well, if the mountain
won't come to Mohammed...

929
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,000
What?

930
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,280
I'm trying to teach
your mother the offside rule.

931
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:03,080
I've decided that I've got to take
an interest or I'm going to lose you.

932
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:07,160
This way we can all enjoy football
as a family.

933
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:11,520
Right. So, don't tell me.
The offside rule is...

934
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,640
..when...

935
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,800
..the French mustard...

936
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:21,080
has to be between the teriyaki
sauce and the sea salt.

937
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,200
- She's got it.
- Got it!

938
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,520
- Wonderful!
- Have you read all these as well?

939
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,680
Yeah. Oh, and do you know what?

940
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,880
One of those England girls' players
is a maths teacher as well,

941
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,640
and she's happily married with a baby!

942
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,240
..A-level results...

943
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,560
..A-level results...

944
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,760
Hurry up, Mum!

945
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,200
Good.

946
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,320
Thank you! Thank you!

947
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,480
Jesminder Kaur Bhamra,

948
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,640
B.L.L.B,

949
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,800
you can become a fine,
top-class solicitor now.

950
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:30,520
Clean and serene

951
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,680
Dream

952
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,000
Dream the dream

953
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,360
Clean

954
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,240
And serene

955
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,520
Dream

956
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:50,200
Dream the dream

957
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,440
Clean

958
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:57,080
And serene

959
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,680
Dream

960
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,920
Dream the dream.

961
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,320
She's not coming, Joe.

962
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:10,320
- Her sister's wedding's on Sunday.
- Shit!

963
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,440
Guess I'm on my own, then.

964
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,080
You'll impress the scout. No worries.

965
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:18,120
- How was she?
- A right stroppy cow, actually.

966
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,440
She's really pissed off she can't make it

967
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:24,040
and she doesn't know what to do.

968
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:44,200
Go on! Kick the ball, kick the ball!

969
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,160
Three players behind you, hunting you!

970
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,200
Yes?

971
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,920
I'm sorry to bother you like this.

972
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:07,000
- I have nothing to say to you.
- I appreciate it

973
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:10,240
and I won't keep you long,
but I wanted you to know

974
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,240
that a scout's coming to our match tomorrow.

975
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,360
So?

976
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:21,160
So, it's the opportunity of a lifetime
for Jess. Please, Mr Bhamra,

977
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:24,480
- don't let her talent go to waste.
- Thank you.

978
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,800
What did he say, Dad?

979
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,160
Don't play with your future, putar.

980
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,200
Wait!

981
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,800
I'm sorry about the final.

982
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,120
No, I'M sorry, Jess.

983
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:58,320
I got my results. I'm starting university soon.

984
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,800
I won't have time to train and stuff.

985
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,240
Now that's a shame. I could have
seen you play for England some day.

986
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:12,240
- Jules still has a shot.
- She told me about the scout.

987
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:16,480
- Sorry I'm letting her down.
- That scout's coming for you, too.

988
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:19,680
- He's interested in both of you.
- Me?!

989
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:25,000
Why are you doing this to me, Joe?

990
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:30,600
Every time I talk myself out of it,
you make it sound so easy.

991
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:34,680
I guess I don't want to give up on you.

992
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,440
So, are you promised
to one of those blokes in there?

993
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:47,240
Don't be silly!
I'm not promised to anyone.

994
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:52,400
You're lucky...to have a family
that cares that much about you.

995
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:57,120
I can understand
you don't want to mess with it.

996
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,720
Joe...

997
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:04,400
And I don't fancy being busted by
your dad again. You'd better get back.

998
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:10,600
I hope all goes well for you tomorrow,
and good luck with your studies.

999
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,520
Come and see us some time.

1000
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:27,600
Let's hope she fits
in the car with that hat on.

1001
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:33,440
We're going to a football match
not Ascot! You look lovely.

1002
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,960
Beautiful...

1003
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,120
Eyes down! Look sad!

1004
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:41,880
Don't smile! Indian brides never smile.

1005
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,000
You'll ruin the bloody video!

1006
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:47,640
She looks like a jar
of bloody Ragu, innit?

1007
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:51,880
Where's the flippin' Rolls?
Can't anything happen without me?!

1008
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,480
One, two, three, flour...

1009
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,720
You gave me something like loving

1010
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:20,440
And took me in so soon

1011
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:22,920
You took my fleelings flrom nothing

1012
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:25,440
Came back at noon

1013
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:27,560
Just meet me, I'm ready

1014
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,640
To show myselfl to you

1015
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:33,520
So ifl I lose my patience

1016
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,840
You must try to understand

1017
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,360
Try to understand

1018
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,760
Ifl I lose my patience

1019
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,080
Oh, yeah

1020
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,520
'Cause you make me fleel

1021
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,680
Yeah, yeah

1022
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,760
'Cause you make me fleel wild
(yeah, yeah)

1023
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:57,360
You touch my inner smile

1024
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,040
Yeah, yeah

1025
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:02,400
You got me in the mood
(yeah, yeah)

1026
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:07,760
So come on, make your rule
and flree me...

1027
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,400
What are you doing?!

1028
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,000
We'll make the second half if we go now.

1029
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:15,960
My mum and dad will go spare!
I've got to put them first today.

1030
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,920
- They won't even notice.
- I can't! Look how happy they are.

1031
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:22,080
I don't want to ruin it for them.

1032
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,920
- Ruin what?
- Nothing.

1033
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,960
It's the final of the football tournament.

1034
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:30,720
- We'll drive there. It won't take long.
- Stop it, Tony.

1035
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,800
It doesn't matter. I don't want
to spoil the day for you and Mum.

1036
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,480
Pinky is so happy and you look
as if you're at my funeral.

1037
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,160
I'm sorry, Dad.

1038
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:46,160
If this means I'll see you smiling on your
sister's wedding day, then go now,

1039
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:50,000
but when you come back, I want
to see you happy on the video.

1040
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,120
Play well and make us proud.

1041
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:44,960
Joe!

1042
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,080
What's happening?

1043
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,840
Start warming up.
We're one-nil down, half an hour to go.

1044
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:12,360
Come on, ref!

1045
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:16,080
Ref!

1046
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,640
Form a wall! Form a wall!

1047
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,120
Well done!

1048
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,960
Have any of you seen Jesminder?

1049
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,680
Jesminder!

1050
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:50,080
Jesminder?

1051
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:05,000
Go on, Jules!

1052
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,720
One-all!

1053
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:35,720
Where does this bit go?
You're doing it wrong. Round that way.

1054
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:38,480
Tuck it in. Tuck it in.

1055
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:41,320
You've got your shorts on.

1056
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,120
Where does that bit go?

1057
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:44,720
Lift your leg up.

1058
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:47,560
- Paxton, Bhamra, are you decent?
- Yes!

1059
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,280
Oh, is that the coach?

1060
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:56,520
- Who's that?
- Dunno. He looks important.

1061
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,920
- Yeah.
- I haven't seen him before.

1062
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:05,560
- Look how happy she is.
- I know.

1063
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:16,160
I can't believe it! It was amazing!
My eyes just glazed over!

1064
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:19,840
What a game for him to see!
It's incredible! Santa Clara!

1065
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,920
It's in California! It's one of the top teams!

1066
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:27,240
He said he'd give us a full
scholarship so you'll pay nothing!

1067
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:32,200
Oh, it's so amazing! Me and Jess
there together, the pair of us!

1068
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,640
Come on, Paula.

1069
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,480
I'm not blaming you but it is the football.

1070
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,120
It is!

1071
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:19,720
Come on, darling. Come on.

1072
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,160
I'm off, then!

1073
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,640
Sweetheart, where are you going
in your best trousers?

1074
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,800
- Out.
- Where? Who with?

1075
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:34,520
I'm meeting Jess at her
sister's wedding to celebrate.

1076
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:40,080
- Wait! I'll take you.
- Oh, thanks, Mum!

1077
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:19,840
God, it's so colourful.
Everyone looks brilliant! Look at the car!

1078
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,920
- How are you?
- You look gorgeous!

1079
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:39,920
- Mum...
- Hello, Mrs Paxton.

1080
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:42,040
How could you be such a hypocrite?

1081
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:45,200
How could you be all respectful here
with your lot

1082
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:49,160
when you've been kissing
my daughter in broad daylight?!

1083
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,840
Hmm?

1084
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,760
Get your lesbian feet out of my shoes!

1085
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,520
Lesbian? Her birthday's in March.
I thought she was a Pisces.

1086
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:10,600
She no Lebanese. She Punjabi!

1087
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,040
Do you mind? This is my wedding!

1088
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:16,120
- Sorry.
- How could you do this, sweetheart?

1089
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:18,760
What is wrong with you?!

1090
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,760
What's that gora
going on about you being a lezbo?

1091
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,320
- I thought you fancied your coach!
- I don't know what she was saying!

1092
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:33,720
Don't you want all of this? This is
the best day of your life, innit?

1093
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:38,360
I want more than this. They've offered
us a scholarship to go to America.

1094
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:42,480
Dad won't let you live abroad
without getting married first.

1095
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:47,880
- What were you thinking?!
- I saw you with my own eyes!

1096
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:51,960
You were kissing after your match!
I'm not stupid, you know!

1097
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:54,920
And anyway, look at the clothes you wear!

1098
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:58,520
Mother, just because
I wear trackies and play sport

1099
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:00,680
does not make me a lesbian!

1100
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:08,360
Me and Jess were fighting because
we both fancied our coach - Joe!

1101
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:15,600
- What, a man, Joe?
- Yeah, as in male - Joe!

1102
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:17,640
Joe, our coach! Joe, man, Joe!

1103
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:24,160
Anyway, being a lesbian is not that big a deal.

1104
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:26,960
Oh, no, sweetheart, of course it isn't.

1105
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,680
No! I mean, I've got nothing against it.

1106
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:35,360
I was cheering for Martina Navratilova
as much as the next person.

1107
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,280
What was that English woman saying?

1108
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:44,400
- Why was she talking about kissing?
- She got confused like Teetu's parents.

1109
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:47,640
It's so hard when young girls
have such short hair.

1110
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:50,120
Maybe we were making too much noise.

1111
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:54,760
English people are always complaining
when we're having functions.

1112
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,600
Why did she take Jesminder's shoes?

1113
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,640
How am I going to tell 'em, Tony?

1114
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:10,840
I'll have to now or I'll end up a solicitor,
bored out of my mind.

1115
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,040
Come with me.

1116
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,760
Mum, Uncle, Auntie...

1117
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,600
We've got something we want to tell you.

1118
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:33,720
Why is he holding her hand?

1119
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,560
We've been good friends for a long time now.

1120
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,280
We'd like to ask for your blessings.

1121
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:43,960
We'd like to get engaged.

1122
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:51,760
But there's one condition -
Jesminder goes to college first,

1123
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:53,720
anywhere that she wants.

1124
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,520
Of course, putar!

1125
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:01,960
Well, we have relatives all the way
in Glasgow, in Portsmouth...

1126
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:03,800
Mum, Dad...

1127
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,440
Tony's lying.

1128
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:07,800
We're not getting married.

1129
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:13,080
Tony only said that to help me,
but I'm not lying any more.

1130
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:17,880
I played in the final today, and we won!

1131
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:21,520
- When?
- I wasn't going to go but Dad let me.

1132
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,040
And it was brilliant.

1133
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,320
I played the best ever!

1134
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:33,320
And I was happy because I wasn't
sneaking off and lying to you!

1135
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,920
I didn't ask to be good at football.

1136
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:39,160
Guru Nanak must have blessed me.

1137
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:43,840
There was a scout from America there today,

1138
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:47,440
and he's offered me a place at a top university

1139
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:52,760
with a free scholarship and a chance
to play football professionally,

1140
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:56,760
and I really want to go,
and if I can't tell you what I want now,

1141
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,560
then I'll never be happy, whatever I do.

1142
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,480
You let her leave her sister's wedding
to go to a football match?!

1143
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:09,760
Maybe you could handle
her long face, I could not.

1144
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I didn't have the heart to stop her.

1145
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:15,880
And that's why she's ready to go
all the way to America now!

1146
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,400
She's dead, man!

1147
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:23,480
It's all right, Mum, just leave it.

1148
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:30,240
When those bloody English cricket players

1149
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:32,840
threw me out of their club like a dog...

1150
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,120
..I never complained.

1151
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:41,080
On the contrary, I vowed
that I will never play again.

1152
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:42,640
Who suffered?

1153
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:44,320
Me.

1154
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,440
But I don't want Jessie to suffer.

1155
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:57,120
I don't want her to make the same
mistakes that her father made

1156
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:00,080
of accepting life, accepting situations.

1157
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,760
I want her to fight.

1158
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,120
And I want her to win...

1159
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,920
..because I've seen her play.
She is brilliant!

1160
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:19,640
I don't think anybody
has the right of stopping her.

1161
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:29,720
Two daughters made happy in one day.

1162
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:32,080
What else can a father ask for?

1163
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:37,080
At least I've taught her full Indian dinner.
The rest is up to God.

1164
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:45,640
Joe!

1165
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,720
I'm going!

1166
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:50,680
They said I could go!

1167
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:01,760
Sorry. I forgot.

1168
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:05,200
It's OK now. I'm not your coach any more.

1169
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,320
We can do what we want.

1170
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:13,520
- Joe...
- Your dad's not here, is he?

1171
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,760
I'm sorry, Joe. I can't.

1172
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:26,080
I thought you wanted...

1173
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:33,760
Letting me go is a really big step
for my mum and dad.

1174
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:39,400
I don't know how they'd survive
if I told them about you, too.

1175
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,800
I guess there's not much point
with you going to America anyway, is there?

1176
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:38,680
- It's not perfume, is it?
- No. It's not what you think.

1177
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:40,840
It was your mum's idea.

1178
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:47,240
Oh! Thank you so much!

1179
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:52,200
Keep this by your bed. Call Papu Uncle
in Canada as soon as you land.

1180
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:54,760
At least there's some family close by.

1181
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,560
It's getting really late.
You'd better board the plane.

1182
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:06,320
Jess!

1183
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,880
Don't worry. That's her coach.

1184
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,360
What are you doing here?

1185
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:19,080
They offered me the job,
coaching the men's side.

1186
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:22,640
- No more pulling pints.
- That's great, Joe!

1187
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,480
I turned them down.

1188
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:28,360
- Why did you...?
- I'm going to coach the girls' side.

1189
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,800
They want us to turn pro next year.

1190
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:34,280
Can't keep losing my best players
to the Yanks, can I?

1191
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:37,680
That's brilliant!
You should tell your dad, you know.

1192
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:39,880
I already did.

1193
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,000
Are we doing the right thing?

1194
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:45,360
Whatever God has written for her
will happen.

1195
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:49,160
- Maybe I'll sign you if I can afford you!
- Yeah, you wish!

1196
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:52,680
Look...

1197
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:56,640
- I can't let you go without knowing.
- What?

1198
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:02,360
That even with the distance
and the concerns of your family,

1199
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:04,720
we might still have something.

1200
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,440
What do you think?

1201
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,680
Oh, my God, it's Beckham! It's a sign!

1202
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:25,200
Jess, it's Becks!

1203
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:33,280
'Cause you make me fleel

1204
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:37,480
(Yeah, yeah)
'Cause you make me fleel...

1205
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:46,120
I'm back at Christmas.
We'll tackle my mum and dad then.

1206
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:52,160
I'd better go.

1207
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,920
- Take care of yourself.
- See ya, mate.

1208
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:04,200
- Have a good time.
- Yeah, and you.

1209
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:08,160
Come on, you two,
you're gonna miss this plane. Ticket. Go!

1210
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:09,800
See you later.

1211
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:14,600
Come on!

1212
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:16,920
Bye, sweetheart!

1213
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:22,200
Just move on up...

1214
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:23,880
Oh, thank you.

1215
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:26,520
Hello. Nice to meet you.

1216
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,520
Come on. Let's have a look.

1217
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:45,320
Sweatshirts!

1218
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:47,240
Look at that!

1219
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:48,960
Just move on up!

1220
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:52,240
Move on up!

1221
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:55,640
Move on up...

1222
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,480
Well, move on up!

1223
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:05,680
Move on up!

1224
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:17,560
Yes!

1225
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:19,680
No, no, no.

1226
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,360
Oh, yes, yes!

1227
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,520
Feeling hot, hot, hot!

1228
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,800
Feeling hot, hot, hot!

1229
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:49,160
Feeling hot, hot, hot!

1230
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:53,880
