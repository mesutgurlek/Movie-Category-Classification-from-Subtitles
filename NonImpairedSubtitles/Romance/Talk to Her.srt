1
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:36,455
TALK TO HER

2
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,670
The stage is full of wooden
chairs and tables.

3
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,075
Two women come out with robes.

4
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:38,034
Their eyes are closed.
Like two sleepwalkers.

5
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,591
You get scared...They trip
on everything, poor them.

6
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:46,433
But suddenly, a man appears.

7
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,349
With a very sad face, the
saddest I have ever seen.

8
00:03:51,838 --> 00:03:55,466
He pushes tables and chairs
out of their way.

9
00:03:57,357 --> 00:04:00,394
You can't imagine how touching
it was.

10
00:04:01,837 --> 00:04:05,431
Someone was sitting next to me.
In his 40s, hundsome.

11
00:04:06,516 --> 00:04:09,826
He cried with emotion,
lots of times.

12
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:13,995
I don't understand why...
It was very beautiful!

13
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,671
I have a surprise for you!

14
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:28,830
I have an autograph of
Rina Baus for you.

15
00:04:29,114 --> 00:04:31,582
I had to buy the photo.

16
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:36,314
It is in english and says:

17
00:04:36,314 --> 00:04:39,669
I hope you surpass all
the obstacles...

18
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,468
... and start dancing.

19
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:09,903
-She has her period.
-It's early.

20
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:20,016
Good evening.

21
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:28,576
Benigno, can you
stay tonight?

22
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:32,179
My sister can't,
and I don't have anyone else.

23
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:35,255
Why did you come?
You should have called.

24
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:38,857
I am not taking advantage of you.
This week you did 3 nights.

25
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:42,970
Don't worry. A free afternoon
is enough for me.

26
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:46,776
I have to see the house
workers. It's a mess.

27
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:51,101
And to frame a photo.

28
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:55,413
My condition is not improving.
The hospital will decide.

29
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:58,892
Your husband left you
and the children.

30
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,769
Just come the nights you can.
We will be ok.

31
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,450
Thanks a lot.

32
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:12,015
-You cut off the intestinal food.
-She couldn't take it.

33
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:15,410
-We will try again tomorrow.
-Yes, go now.

34
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:18,609
And keep the spirits up!

35
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:30,333
Six bulls and a woman.
Wednesday at Briuega.

36
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:35,126
Lydia P Gonzales will
fight six bulls.

37
00:07:36,937 --> 00:07:39,609
Why such a drastic decision?

38
00:07:39,736 --> 00:07:43,251
It's my job. 2 bulls, or 6.
Whatever they say.

39
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:46,896
People say a lot of bullfighters
won't fight with you...

40
00:07:46,896 --> 00:07:48,816
...because you are a woman.

41
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:51,454
People can say what they want.

42
00:07:51,765 --> 00:07:55,155
Too much chauvinism in bullfighting,
but there are exceptions.

43
00:07:55,565 --> 00:08:00,320
Nino Valencia was happy to share
billing with you for several months.

44
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:06,242
Do you think he did it
to promote himself?

45
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:08,834
And when he succeeded that,
he abandoned you?

46
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:12,035
I told you, I don't want
to talk about this!

47
00:08:12,363 --> 00:08:15,603
But by talking about
certain problems...

48
00:08:15,603 --> 00:08:18,123
...is the first step
towards their solution.

49
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,717
-Nino Valencia...
-Enough!

50
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:25,042
My dear Lydia, let me
finish the question.

51
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:28,273
I am not discussing this.
I told you earlier.

52
00:08:28,402 --> 00:08:32,642
You didn't say anything earlier!
It's bad what you are saying!

53
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:35,721
They will think
it's a fixed interview.

54
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:39,509
And I am on of the few who
dare say the truth...

55
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:42,681
...and you should dare accept

56
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:45,877
...that Nino Valencia
took advantage of you.

57
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,760
He shared with you not only
the fame, but sex as well.

58
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,196
And he left you when
time was right.

59
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:58,596
Juan Luis, Marco here...
How are you?

60
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:01,349
I want to ask you something.

61
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:05,475
I would like to do an article
about Lydia Gonzales.

62
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:08,593
Yes, I see it too...

63
00:09:11,238 --> 00:09:13,991
I would like to do something
deep.

64
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:19,068
For the Sunday issue?
Great...

65
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:16,911
-The woman has gone crazy!
-She dedicates it to you.

66
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:20,986
She would let the bull injur
her, just so that you see it.

67
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:24,503
You shouldn't have come,
especially you.

68
00:11:13,427 --> 00:11:16,418
Don't tell me anything.
I know what I am doing.

69
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:20,779
Nino should concentrate.
He doesn't want any more worries.

70
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:25,025
Nothing to worry about. He should
just come to pick up his stuff.

71
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:29,225
-Or tell me where to send them.
-Send them at my place.

72
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:33,184
He, himself, should say so.
This is nothing to do with you.

73
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,013
You can leave whenever you want.

74
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:41,104
-Good evening.
-Scotch on the rocks, please.

75
00:11:41,104 --> 00:11:44,335
-What glass do you prefer?
-A tall one.

76
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:51,935
Can I talk to you for
a minute, please?

77
00:11:53,623 --> 00:11:56,774
Forget it. When something is
over, it's over.

78
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:01,931
-What are you saying?
-Can I talk to you?

79
00:12:04,742 --> 00:12:08,222
If you take me to Madrid,
we can talk on the way.

80
00:12:08,222 --> 00:12:10,337
It will be my pleasure.

81
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,251
-Who named you Lydia;
-My father.

82
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,617
It's as if he sealed your destiny.

83
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,017
He always wanted to be a bullfighter,
but stayed a banderillero.

84
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:38,414
He is the one that was there
for me, more than anyone else.

85
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:41,167
But he died last year.

86
00:12:42,418 --> 00:12:44,409
I am sorry.

87
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:48,408
'El Pais' wants me to do a profile
on you for their Sunday issue.

88
00:12:48,658 --> 00:12:52,013
Do you write on bullfighting?
I don't know your name.

89
00:12:52,217 --> 00:12:55,414
To be honest,
I know nothing of it.

90
00:12:56,617 --> 00:13:00,292
But I know a lot about
desperate women.

91
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,972
And who told you I am
desperate?

92
00:13:04,296 --> 00:13:07,736
-This is the impression I have.
-Bullfighting doesn't interest you.

93
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:10,808
You are interested in my
relationship with Nino Valencia.

94
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:14,127
Tell EI Pais to leave me alone!

95
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:54,452
-Take me from here!
-What's going on?

96
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:58,206
Take me from here! There is
a snake in the kitchen.

97
00:13:58,491 --> 00:14:01,563
-Give me the keys.
-The door is open.

98
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:04,041
Calm down.
And stay there.

99
00:15:34,202 --> 00:15:36,193
My purse.

100
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:40,476
Take me to a hotel.

101
00:15:40,842 --> 00:15:43,515
I am never coming back to
this house.

102
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:47,870
-To which hotel?
-To Eurobuilding, lets say.

103
00:16:16,478 --> 00:16:19,675
Don't tell anyone about
the snake, please.

104
00:16:20,558 --> 00:16:23,197
Only my family knows.

105
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:26,549
I always respect other
people's phobias.

106
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:31,035
After what you have done, how
can I say no to to the profile?

107
00:16:31,797 --> 00:16:35,756
Think about it again. I will
call tomorrow, tell me then.

108
00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:38,831
Thanks for everything.

109
00:17:01,074 --> 00:17:04,862
Do you want me to stay? I can
sleep in the sofa.

110
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:08,225
No, I need to get used to
being alone.

111
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,027
Do you wash her?

112
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,187
What do you think?

113
00:17:53,869 --> 00:17:56,508
-How was the night?
-normal.

114
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,458
-Give it to me. I will do it.
-I am going now.

115
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:02,944
-Good bye.
-Bye, Matilde.

116
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:08,299
It's so hot!

117
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:12,297
-Lets cut her hair.
-short, it's more practical.

118
00:18:13,228 --> 00:18:16,264
We will leave it as it was
when she came here...

119
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:19,427
...so that she is not surprised
when she wakes up.

120
00:18:19,427 --> 00:18:22,419
After 4 years, it will be great.

121
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:24,987
I believe in miracles.
So should you.

122
00:18:24,987 --> 00:18:27,978
-Why me?
-Because you need them.

123
00:18:28,226 --> 00:18:32,265
One might happen to you,
and you will not know.

124
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,022
So hot!

125
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:37,345
I took something from the
drugstore...

126
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:40,337
...to help stop the perspiration
stains on my uniform.

127
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:44,185
My armpits are ok,
but look at my face.

128
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:46,540
-What's it called?
-Perspirex.

129
00:18:54,944 --> 00:18:57,412
It's Marco...
Remember me?

130
00:18:58,183 --> 00:19:00,617
-How are you?
-Naked.

131
00:19:05,863 --> 00:19:08,740
I need to buy some clothes.
That's all I've got.

132
00:19:09,222 --> 00:19:11,690
I can bring you some
from your place.

133
00:19:12,062 --> 00:19:15,134
I don't want anything from there.
Maybe another time.

134
00:19:15,462 --> 00:19:17,578
-Where are we going?
-To Sybilla.

135
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:20,289
-You think I am crazy.
-Why?

136
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:24,011
-Because I don't want to go home.
-No, I understand.

137
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:28,579
When I separated, I couldn't
sleep in the same bed...

138
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:31,977
I was sleeping in the sofa,
in the living room.

139
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,378
For a week. Until I finally
bought a new bed.

140
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,896
So, you are separated.

141
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,536
I am alone.

142
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:46,088
AFTER A FEW MONTHS

143
00:20:03,257 --> 00:20:05,930
Marco, we should
talk afterwards.

144
00:20:06,257 --> 00:20:09,727
-We've been talking for an hour.
-You have, not me.

145
00:20:10,737 --> 00:20:12,648
Indeed.

146
00:20:40,214 --> 00:20:44,605
Did you read about the nuns
that got raped by the misionaries?

147
00:20:46,213 --> 00:20:49,967
Priests, themselves!
It's horrible!

148
00:20:50,453 --> 00:20:53,333
Yeah, they've gone bad too!
Where are we heading to?

149
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,847
First they raped the locals.

150
00:20:56,253 --> 00:20:59,562
Then, due to AIDS, they started
raping nuns.

151
00:21:00,452 --> 00:21:03,125
And I admired them so much!

152
00:21:03,452 --> 00:21:06,091
Not all of them are rapists,
for sure.

153
00:21:06,412 --> 00:21:09,164
No, some of them are
pedophiles.

154
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:13,166
-What's that? Everyone loves fucking.
-Antonio, you are an animal!

155
00:21:14,931 --> 00:21:17,922
-How do the bulls look?
-Good, but fat.

156
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,487
-How much do you think?
-Over 500 kilos.

157
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,959
I am going to the bar. And don't
forget, we are eating home.

158
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,559
If the kids don't see their aunt,
there'll be hell to pay.

159
00:24:41,942 --> 00:24:44,614
Don't cry, my love.

160
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,020
-How is it?
-Very bad.

161
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,817
It tore her apart.

162
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,420
The father will be happy now!

163
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,617
'Not the little one!', we kept
telling him, my mother and I.

164
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:10,859
And yet, she became like him.

165
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:13,089
Don't be upset.

166
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:16,134
What time is it?

167
00:25:16,378 --> 00:25:18,448
It has been four hours.

168
00:25:19,778 --> 00:25:22,611
AFTER THREE WEEKS

169
00:25:23,938 --> 00:25:26,057
Are you going to Cordoba?

170
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:29,686
Yes...I would like to stay,
but I can't.

171
00:25:29,777 --> 00:25:33,213
We can't do anything extra.

172
00:25:33,337 --> 00:25:35,737
The bar's been closed for 20 days.

173
00:25:35,737 --> 00:25:39,172
The kids are with the neigbhour,
and I've neglected the other one.

174
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:42,846
If something happens, can
you be here in 2 hours?

175
00:25:43,296 --> 00:25:47,288
-Rest assured for that.
-We have to have faith.

176
00:25:49,335 --> 00:25:51,975
I light some candles...

177
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:54,887
...but I find it very
difficult to have faith.

178
00:25:55,575 --> 00:25:58,691
When can we put her medals
back on her?

179
00:25:59,694 --> 00:26:01,574
Not yet.

180
00:26:01,574 --> 00:26:05,692
With all these...
wounds, the tracheotomy...

181
00:26:08,614 --> 00:26:10,808
She never took them off.

182
00:26:24,452 --> 00:26:26,488
I will get a vase.

183
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:48,607
I have to go to the US
for three months.

184
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,161
It is very important,
says my agent.

185
00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:56,368
And yet...the way things
stand here...

186
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:01,603
...I don't want to go.

187
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:17,319
Can you get out for
a moment, please?

188
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:29,438
No smoking here.

189
00:27:31,926 --> 00:27:34,121
Did she talk to you that day?

190
00:27:35,885 --> 00:27:39,195
-Or rather, I talked.
-And what did you say?

191
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,595
Things that concern me.

192
00:27:43,365 --> 00:27:46,244
Did she tell you anything
about me?

193
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:50,203
Honestly, Lydia hadn't talked
about you for a long time.

194
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:55,401
-It's my fault for what happened.
-No, it's my fault.

195
00:31:52,582 --> 00:31:55,618
Caetano made me
freak out.

196
00:31:58,861 --> 00:32:02,376
Marco, I've always wanted
to ask you something.

197
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:06,295
Why did you cry that night,
after you killed the snake?

198
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,409
It brought me lots of memories.

199
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,569
Years ago, I had to
kill another snake.

200
00:32:15,939 --> 00:32:18,055
We were in Africa.

201
00:32:18,499 --> 00:32:21,499
She had the same phobia as you.

202
00:32:21,499 --> 00:32:26,526
She was waiting outside the tent,
terrified, defenseless...

203
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:30,088
...and totally naked...

204
00:32:31,738 --> 00:32:35,014
...because she had seen the snake,
while we were asleep.

205
00:32:35,378 --> 00:32:38,528
Was it the same one who made
you sleep in the living room?

206
00:32:40,857 --> 00:32:43,212
I hate that woman.

207
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:47,176
-I haven't seen her for years.
-Even worse.

208
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:50,168
What can I do to make you
forget her?

209
00:32:50,376 --> 00:32:52,731
Exactly what you are doing now.

210
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:26,047
You were sound asleep. We didn't
want to wake you up.

211
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:31,527
-Is Dr Vega here?
-He is in his office.

212
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:14,960
Rosa, close the door.
There's a draft.

213
00:34:15,728 --> 00:34:18,845
-She opened her eyes.
-That gives me the creeps!

214
00:34:19,128 --> 00:34:22,165
-And when she yawns?
-I shit myself!

215
00:34:24,008 --> 00:34:27,124
Good morning, doctor.
I want to talk to you.

216
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:29,962
How are you? Did you sleep well?

217
00:34:30,887 --> 00:34:32,479
I will buy you coffee.

218
00:34:34,127 --> 00:34:37,357
How long for might Lydia
stay like that?

219
00:34:37,606 --> 00:34:41,315
Months... years...
maybe for the rest of her life...

220
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,601
There is no hope?

221
00:34:46,005 --> 00:34:49,441
As a doctor, I have to say
no... However...

222
00:34:49,725 --> 00:34:51,716
RESUSCITATION

223
00:34:52,085 --> 00:34:55,441
Meryl Moon wakes up after
15 years in a coma.

224
00:34:55,765 --> 00:34:58,884
She went into a coma during
childbirth.

225
00:34:58,884 --> 00:35:03,196
Meryl was a PVS, persistent
vegetative state, like Lydia, for life.

226
00:35:04,004 --> 00:35:07,163
Her recovery contradicts
everything I am about to say.

227
00:35:07,163 --> 00:35:09,119
That is, that there is hope.

228
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,883
I insist. Scientifically, no.

229
00:35:11,883 --> 00:35:15,034
But if you want to have faith,
OK.

230
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:18,642
Is she opening her eyes?
Or I imagine this?

231
00:35:18,642 --> 00:35:23,079
She does, but that doesn't mean
she is aware of anything.

232
00:35:23,562 --> 00:35:27,475
Her brain cell has been
completely destroyed.

233
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:32,591
However, it can control
the automatic functions...

234
00:35:32,961 --> 00:35:37,361
such as breathing, sleeping,
waking up and intestinal functions.

235
00:35:37,361 --> 00:35:40,160
She opens her eyes,
but mechanically.

236
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,436
Her brain is dead. She has
no ideas and feelings.

237
00:35:57,759 --> 00:36:00,148
Come in, please.

238
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:14,429
-My name is Benigno.
-Marco Zuloaga

239
00:36:14,597 --> 00:36:16,667
This is Alicia.

240
00:36:21,437 --> 00:36:23,836
Was it your first night here?

241
00:36:23,836 --> 00:36:26,796
The first one is the worst.
Then you get used to it.

242
00:36:26,796 --> 00:36:28,836
Why these boots?

243
00:36:28,836 --> 00:36:32,226
They prevent her feet from
twisting or falling.

244
00:36:32,676 --> 00:36:36,793
-They look like 'Ibiza' boots.
-I've never been to Ibiza.

245
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:40,431
-I know you.
-From my books?

246
00:36:41,955 --> 00:36:45,993
It was in Cafe Muller...
We happened to be sitting together.

247
00:36:48,314 --> 00:36:52,307
And at some stage,
you started crying.

248
00:36:54,664 --> 00:36:58,781
I told you about him.
He cried watching "Caf?Muller".

249
00:37:00,383 --> 00:37:02,374
I have to go.

250
00:37:03,623 --> 00:37:06,739
That fast?
We barely talked.

251
00:37:06,942 --> 00:37:09,979
-Maybe another time.
-Will you come in the afternoon?

252
00:37:10,342 --> 00:37:13,857
Come to see us. I am always here,
even during the night.

253
00:37:14,222 --> 00:37:17,213
I am a 'veteran' here.
If you need something...

254
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:44,378
-Should I call Dr Vega;
-Carry on with what you are doing.

255
00:37:57,578 --> 00:38:01,729
The other day, while browsing
my notes...

256
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:07,452
...I found some
from your visit.

257
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:12,248
I wrote a topic to be discussed
during the second visit...

258
00:38:12,536 --> 00:38:14,845
...that never took place.

259
00:38:15,136 --> 00:38:18,606
-What about?
-Your sexual orientation.

260
00:38:20,496 --> 00:38:24,807
-My sexual orientation?
-yes, your sexuality.

261
00:38:25,415 --> 00:38:29,090
Whether you like men or women.

262
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:35,133
During your visit, you said
you were still a virgin.

263
00:38:35,494 --> 00:38:39,282
Answering your question
somehow...

264
00:38:41,174 --> 00:38:44,802
... I think I look for men,
mostly.

265
00:38:46,173 --> 00:38:50,212
-Is this why you came to see me?
-I can't remember now.

266
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:55,491
I guess that's it...
But I am very well now.

267
00:38:55,612 --> 00:38:57,603
Do you have a partner?

268
00:38:57,852 --> 00:39:03,165
More or less. I am not alone
anymore. I don't have a problem.

269
00:39:03,812 --> 00:39:06,689
I hope you were not offended
by my question.

270
00:39:12,331 --> 00:39:14,401
Was her father here?

271
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,845
He asked me if I am a fag.

272
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:21,482
He used an american expression,
more subtle.

273
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,610
-What is my orientation?
-And what did you say?

274
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:27,203
-That I like men.
-Really?

275
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:30,237
No, you fool. I lied.

276
00:39:30,529 --> 00:39:33,839
How can he dare ask whether
I like men or women?

277
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:37,080
-What does he care?
-I am glad I found out.

278
00:39:37,448 --> 00:39:42,203
Did he ask the head nurseor you
if you like bestiality or coprophagy?

279
00:39:42,528 --> 00:39:46,157
No, you are right. They don't
ask such things.

280
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:58,077
I might go on a trip, and I won't
be able to come and see you.

281
00:39:58,846 --> 00:40:02,606
But, in Geneva, they've
offered me a creation...

282
00:40:02,606 --> 00:40:05,686
...a chorography
that thrills me.

283
00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:09,394
An old idea for a ballet.
I call it 'Trenches'.

284
00:40:09,485 --> 00:40:12,557
It is about the first
world war.

285
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:15,439
I will need a lot of dancers...

286
00:40:15,525 --> 00:40:19,437
...because in the war there
are a lot of soldiers.

287
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:24,280
But everyone dances in Geneva.
It is great.

288
00:40:24,684 --> 00:40:29,204
I want female dancers too, because
the soldier when dying...

289
00:40:29,204 --> 00:40:33,037
...lets his soul
get out of his body...

290
00:40:33,323 --> 00:40:36,998
...the ghost of which
will be a female dancer.

291
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:41,042
With a white classic skirt
like 'Giselle'...

292
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:44,802
...but with red stains of blood.

293
00:40:44,802 --> 00:40:46,202
Very good!

294
00:40:46,202 --> 00:40:48,242
Alicia loved it.

295
00:40:48,242 --> 00:40:52,280
It's good because life emerges
out of death.

296
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:56,198
the female emerges from
the male.

297
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:59,519
And from the earthly emerges the...

298
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,314
The beach?

299
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,758
And from the earthly emerges the...

300
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,271
The water?

301
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,990
The ethereal.

302
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,148
The ethereal...
the impreceptible, the ghost.

303
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:24,077
I have the music. It is from
Kristof Penderesky.

304
00:41:24,638 --> 00:41:28,313
It was written for the victims
of Hiroshima, but it's OK.

305
00:41:28,558 --> 00:41:31,516
Of course. Alicia remembers
it perfectly well.

306
00:41:31,878 --> 00:41:36,029
It's music for the battle.
It's wild and beastly.

307
00:41:36,317 --> 00:41:40,037
And regarding the music during deaths
I have a masterpiece...

308
00:41:40,037 --> 00:41:43,507
...which you will listen to,
right now.

309
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:48,310
It will drive you crazy.

310
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,984
Alicia, my dear.

311
00:41:57,395 --> 00:41:59,863
Good bye, my dear.

312
00:42:08,194 --> 00:42:11,869
Good bye, Katerina.
And you look beautiful.

313
00:42:11,994 --> 00:42:15,225
-You should go ahead with 'Trenches'.
-I will.

314
00:42:29,232 --> 00:42:32,588
Look...We will place you
next to the window.

315
00:42:33,872 --> 00:42:37,262
You will be able to see your
friends dancing.

316
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:44,747
I love this room.

317
00:42:45,871 --> 00:42:48,021
I will order everything.

318
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:56,788
Come in and shut the door...

319
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:05,222
How are you?...Shit down.

320
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:08,189
Alicia, look who's here.

321
00:43:08,189 --> 00:43:11,022
We're just getting some air,
reading magazines...

322
00:43:12,908 --> 00:43:15,988
Who was the lady that just left?

323
00:43:15,988 --> 00:43:18,707
Katerina, Alicia's teacher.

324
00:43:19,748 --> 00:43:22,216
Dancing teacher.

325
00:43:22,747 --> 00:43:24,738
Nice character, Katerina.

326
00:43:24,827 --> 00:43:28,217
She has a dancing school somewhere
here. Alicia was her student.

327
00:43:28,467 --> 00:43:31,539
And Katerina loves her like
her daughter.

328
00:43:39,426 --> 00:43:42,338
FOUR YEARS AGO

329
00:44:14,063 --> 00:44:17,259
Benigno, You are by the window
for half an hour.

330
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:19,413
I am coming, mum.

331
00:45:06,418 --> 00:45:08,568
What's the matter? Are you
following me?

332
00:45:12,737 --> 00:45:16,696
This is yours, I think.
It must have dropped you.

333
00:45:19,257 --> 00:45:22,453
is everything there?...
I didn't touch anything...

334
00:45:24,256 --> 00:45:26,976
-Where are you going?
-Home.

335
00:45:26,976 --> 00:45:30,336
Can I accompany you?
I have nothing else to do.

336
00:45:30,336 --> 00:45:34,408
-Yes, but I am going home.
-Of course...It will do me good.

337
00:45:34,655 --> 00:45:38,415
Dancing is my life.
I love dancing shows.

338
00:45:38,415 --> 00:45:40,975
-Do you like dancing?
-Yes, of course

339
00:45:40,975 --> 00:45:43,294
But I don't follow it.

340
00:45:43,294 --> 00:45:45,934
What else do you do,
besides dancing?

341
00:45:45,934 --> 00:45:49,722
I travel and watch old movies.

342
00:45:50,054 --> 00:45:53,887
Silent Cinema is attractive
to me, in particular.

343
00:45:55,653 --> 00:45:58,531
-Where do you go when you go out?
-I don't.

344
00:45:58,613 --> 00:46:00,693
You should go out.

345
00:46:00,693 --> 00:46:03,969
I was taking care of my mother,
but she passed away 2 months ago.

346
00:46:04,252 --> 00:46:07,767
I am sorry. Mine died too,
years ago though.

347
00:46:09,172 --> 00:46:12,767
Here we are...
Thanks for the wallet.

348
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:43,279
Dr Roncero, psychiatrist.
7th left.

349
00:46:46,689 --> 00:46:48,360
Twenty three.

350
00:46:50,248 --> 00:46:53,877
I was waiting for her by the window,
but that day she didn't come.

351
00:46:54,608 --> 00:46:58,566
But I knew her address and that
her father was a psychiatrist.

352
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:08,721
Dr Roncero's office.

353
00:47:09,406 --> 00:47:12,398
I would like to make an
appointment.

354
00:47:12,926 --> 00:47:16,362
-Is it tomorrow at 5 OK?
-Isn't earlier possible?

355
00:47:16,646 --> 00:47:18,841
No, tomorrow at 5.

356
00:47:19,126 --> 00:47:21,036
Your name?

357
00:47:37,484 --> 00:47:41,271
-What do you want?
-I have an appointment at 5.

358
00:47:50,043 --> 00:47:52,556
Come in. Don't stand there.

359
00:47:58,802 --> 00:48:02,431
Benigno Martin?...
I need some proof.

360
00:48:04,321 --> 00:48:08,473
I just wanted to see Alicia,
but I was there, in a psychiatrist.

361
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:11,713
I decided to tell him I missed
my mother.

362
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,317
I started when I was little.

363
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,997
And all those 15 years
you took care of your mother?

364
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,350
I was always next to her...
I was studying to be a nurse.

365
00:48:27,759 --> 00:48:31,035
I was only going out to the
classes.

366
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,278
I was also studying aesthetics,
make-up and hairdressing.

367
00:48:35,278 --> 00:48:37,746
But those by post.

368
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:41,627
So you did those on your mother?

369
00:48:41,998 --> 00:48:45,518
Of course, and I cut her hair,
dyed it, did her nails.

370
00:48:45,518 --> 00:48:48,589
And I scrubbed her down well,
front and back.

371
00:48:48,957 --> 00:48:52,074
My mother wasn't disabled, or mad.

372
00:48:52,237 --> 00:48:54,671
She was only a bit lazy.

373
00:48:55,637 --> 00:48:59,424
She was a beautiful woman
and I didn't want to let herself go.

374
00:49:00,036 --> 00:49:03,506
-What did your father say?
-Nothing. What could he?

375
00:49:03,716 --> 00:49:06,628
-Is he dead?
-God, no.

376
00:49:06,996 --> 00:49:11,671
He is in Sweden, I guess.
I haven't heard of him for years.

377
00:49:11,995 --> 00:49:14,463
Doesn't he come to see you?

378
00:49:15,475 --> 00:49:19,786
He has his own family there,
after he left my mother.

379
00:49:22,274 --> 00:49:24,913
We are not in touch.

380
00:49:25,194 --> 00:49:28,266
Why did you come to see me,
Benigno?

381
00:49:29,473 --> 00:49:32,513
-What's your problem?
-Me? Nothing.

382
00:49:32,513 --> 00:49:36,665
You must have since you came
to see a psychiatrist.

383
00:49:39,233 --> 00:49:41,792
Loneliness, I guess.

384
00:49:44,432 --> 00:49:47,663
Did you have a sexual
relationship with a woman?

385
00:49:49,432 --> 00:49:52,309
-With a man?
-No, neither.

386
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:57,389
I will see you in a week.

387
00:49:57,711 --> 00:50:00,751
-Am I not well doctor?
-That's not it...

388
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:04,790
However, your adolescence was
kind of special.

389
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:08,385
-It wasn't special.
-It was. Very special.

390
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:12,589
And we must analyse it in depth.

391
00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:14,705
Yes, lets analyse it.

392
00:50:19,429 --> 00:50:22,545
-Should I come in a week?
-Very well.

393
00:50:23,268 --> 00:50:25,338
I am glad.

394
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:57,759
-What are you doing here?
-I was just going. Don't be angry.

395
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:02,288
I just wanted to see you...
But I am harmless.

396
00:52:18,648 --> 00:52:22,276
Dr Roncero's office...
Hi, Lola...

397
00:52:22,647 --> 00:52:26,481
I just had a shit of
huge dimensions.

398
00:53:12,683 --> 00:53:15,321
Can you be in charge?

399
00:53:30,921 --> 00:53:34,914
Alicia never came back. I
didn't want to scare her again.

400
00:53:35,281 --> 00:53:38,909
After a week I went to her
place, to see her father.

401
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,473
It was raining during that
whole week.

402
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:51,679
Next time I saw her was here.

403
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:53,397
What happened to her?

404
00:53:53,479 --> 00:53:56,551
A car accident,
during a rainy day.

405
00:53:57,878 --> 00:54:01,871
Her father didn't want her to
be alone, not even for a moment.

406
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:04,472
He asked for the best nurses.

407
00:54:04,638 --> 00:54:09,233
And I have a good reputation here...
So they suggested me...

408
00:54:09,637 --> 00:54:14,552
And when he saw me, he remembered
me, and hesitated for a moment.

409
00:54:14,957 --> 00:54:18,506
But in the end, he took
Matilde and me, exclusively.

410
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:22,550
And this was four years ago...
And here we are now...

411
00:54:22,796 --> 00:54:24,468
Right, Alicia?

412
00:54:28,836 --> 00:54:32,195
I started going to the ballet,
when I had a day-off.

413
00:54:32,195 --> 00:54:35,790
And to the film library to watch
silent movies.

414
00:54:35,955 --> 00:54:39,265
German, american, italian
films, everything.

415
00:54:39,555 --> 00:54:42,591
And afterwards I would tell her
about all that she had seen.

416
00:54:43,754 --> 00:54:47,194
The four most complete years
of my life.

417
00:54:47,194 --> 00:54:49,394
I take care of Alicia...

418
00:54:49,394 --> 00:54:53,147
I do what she would, except
the trips, of course.

419
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:56,385
With me and Lydia
it's the opposite.

420
00:54:58,393 --> 00:55:00,702
I can't touch her.

421
00:55:03,032 --> 00:55:05,910
I don't recognize her body.

422
00:55:06,072 --> 00:55:09,985
Neither can I help the nurses
turn her around.

423
00:55:10,672 --> 00:55:13,711
And I feel I am lousy.

424
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:16,671
Talk to her. Tell her that.

425
00:55:16,671 --> 00:55:18,980
I would like to,
but she can't hear me.

426
00:55:19,231 --> 00:55:21,825
How are you so certain
about this?

427
00:55:21,911 --> 00:55:25,027
Her brain is dead, Benigno.

428
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:29,224
The woman's mind is a mystery,
especially in such sickness.

429
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:33,458
You must look after the woman,
talk to her...

430
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:37,469
...don't foget that she's alive
and that you love her.

431
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:41,587
This is the only therapy.
I know from experience.

432
00:55:43,109 --> 00:55:46,066
And what do you know
about women?

433
00:55:46,548 --> 00:55:50,382
Benigno, what do you know
about women?

434
00:55:54,668 --> 00:55:57,787
What do you know about women?

435
00:55:57,787 --> 00:56:02,303
A lot. 20 years next to one,
4 with another.

436
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:08,226
I like the bullfighter's boyfriend.
He has style.

437
00:56:08,226 --> 00:56:11,186
How do you know? You saw him?

438
00:56:11,186 --> 00:56:15,304
Of course not, but I can tell
from his face.

439
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:18,617
And his bulging trousers.

440
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:24,104
He is a good friend of
Benigno, right;

441
00:56:25,865 --> 00:56:30,460
-Is he gay too?
-No way. What are you saying now?

442
00:56:30,744 --> 00:56:34,657
-Is Benigno, you think?
-Rumours say so!

443
00:56:34,944 --> 00:56:38,144
-You are wrong.
-Dr Vega told me so as well.

444
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:41,943
-And where did he find out?
-From Alicia's father.

445
00:56:41,943 --> 00:56:45,223
I don't like the intimacy
he has with the patient...

446
00:56:45,223 --> 00:56:48,852
...but Vega told me not to
worry, becayse he is gay.

447
00:56:49,583 --> 00:56:53,291
I am going and I'll let you
carry on talking crap about him.

448
00:56:57,262 --> 00:57:00,936
-She likes Benigno.
-She is not with her senses.

449
00:57:06,941 --> 00:57:09,901
I have the day off.
I am going to the film library.

450
00:57:09,901 --> 00:57:13,020
-Are you coming?
-I will see my publisher tonight.

451
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,898
I have to go back to work soon.

452
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:19,413
This woman is not well.

453
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:24,970
You know what I mean.
Her skin is dry.

454
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:28,378
lets see... Here...

455
00:57:31,979 --> 00:57:35,493
-Did you talk to her?
-No, and don't insist.

456
00:57:40,618 --> 00:57:44,405
Hi, Lydia. You must be
patient with him.

457
00:57:47,857 --> 00:57:49,848
Have a good time at work.

458
00:58:03,736 --> 00:58:06,169
'Shrinked lover'.

459
00:58:18,254 --> 00:58:22,213
Rosa has the flu.
I hope you didn't get it from her.

460
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:28,853
I am glad you feel well,
but I will massage you...

461
00:58:28,853 --> 00:58:31,925
...and I will rub you with
a rosemary lotion.

462
00:58:54,811 --> 00:58:57,803
No, nothing is happening to me.

463
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:04,285
Last night I saw a movie that
shook me a lot.

464
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:09,730
It was the love story...

465
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:14,086
...of Alfredo, a nice young
guy, but a bit fat...

466
00:59:14,889 --> 00:59:18,564
...kai Amparo's friend
who is a scientist.

467
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:22,360
Amparo prepares a new
experimental diet...

468
00:59:22,688 --> 00:59:25,680
...that will revolutionize
the food industry.

469
00:59:27,048 --> 00:59:29,562
What egoism! You only
think of yourself!

470
00:59:55,805 --> 00:59:57,397
I found it!

471
01:00:04,724 --> 01:00:08,876
It might be dangerous. I never
gave it to a human before.

472
01:00:17,003 --> 01:00:19,437
You still think I act
with selfishness?

473
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,875
It has done miracles for you!

474
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:07,788
Don't worry, my love!
I will find the antidote!

475
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:17,678
Time was passing by...

476
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:20,635
...but Amparo couldn't find
the antidote...

477
01:01:20,957 --> 01:01:24,347
...and poor Alfredo,
day by day, shrank in misery.

478
01:01:28,957 --> 01:01:31,424
I will always love you.

479
01:01:32,596 --> 01:01:35,156
So that Amparo doesn't suffer...

480
01:01:35,156 --> 01:01:38,865
...Alfredo leaves and goes
to find his mother.

481
01:01:38,996 --> 01:01:42,146
He hadn't seen her for 10 years,
beacause he was lousy.

482
01:01:42,635 --> 01:01:46,230
He hadn't told Ambaro
where his mother lived.

483
01:01:46,515 --> 01:01:49,905
Lots of things going on
in this movie.

484
01:01:50,355 --> 01:01:53,107
But the most important
thing is...

485
01:01:53,754 --> 01:01:58,032
...after years full of
regrets and studies...

486
01:01:59,194 --> 01:02:03,425
...Amparo finds the address
of his mother.

487
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:08,073
And goes there.

488
01:02:52,389 --> 01:02:55,540
Hotel Iukali.
Room 15.

489
01:03:22,226 --> 01:03:25,502
-Sleep, my darling.
-And what if I be a burden by mistake?

490
01:05:50,972 --> 01:05:53,281
And Alfredo...

491
01:05:55,692 --> 01:05:58,525
...stays inside her...

492
01:06:01,201 --> 01:06:03,556
...for ever.

493
01:06:23,919 --> 01:06:27,958
AFTER ONE MONTH

494
01:06:28,999 --> 01:06:32,991
Come on, put your hands
correctly ... This way...

495
01:06:38,558 --> 01:06:41,675
It's quite cool...
It's great...

496
01:06:42,078 --> 01:06:45,069
It's nice here by
the balcony, right?

497
01:06:45,317 --> 01:06:48,389
Lydia likes to sit by
the balcony as well.

498
01:06:49,157 --> 01:06:51,671
Did you hear that? She likes
it a lot.

499
01:06:52,357 --> 01:06:56,474
Look at them... It's as if
they are talking about us.

500
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,865
What do you think they say?

501
01:07:01,596 --> 01:07:04,155
They have no shame.

502
01:07:04,155 --> 01:07:07,511
Women talk about everything
with each other.

503
01:07:08,795 --> 01:07:12,754
Lydia would tell her she has
completed two months sick.

504
01:07:48,191 --> 01:07:50,511
Benjamin and Angela...

505
01:07:50,511 --> 01:07:54,629
...will you bond in marriage,
with your own will?

506
01:07:57,751 --> 01:08:01,379
Join your hands together...

507
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:05,868
...and declare your wish
in front of God.

508
01:08:10,109 --> 01:08:13,101
I, Angela,
take you, Benjamin...

509
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:16,740
...to be my lawful husband...

510
01:08:17,109 --> 01:08:20,737
I will love you
in happiness and in sickness...

511
01:08:21,228 --> 01:08:25,301
...so long as we shall both live.

512
01:08:26,548 --> 01:08:29,745
The Lord that joined you in love...

513
01:08:30,028 --> 01:08:34,225
...let him accept your declaration
of love today.

514
01:08:34,627 --> 01:08:38,302
May your love last eternally.

515
01:08:38,867 --> 01:08:42,097
What are you doing here? We
were gonna meet at the hotel.

516
01:08:42,186 --> 01:08:46,225
I changed my mind.
I've always liked weddings.

517
01:08:46,506 --> 01:08:49,782
Weren't you gonna see
your sister before the game?

518
01:08:50,026 --> 01:08:52,985
I called her.
She will come to the hotel.

519
01:08:52,985 --> 01:08:56,185
I promised her we will eat at
the restaurant tonight.

520
01:08:56,185 --> 01:08:58,096
As you wish.

521
01:09:02,864 --> 01:09:06,618
-Nice ceremony, right?
-Excellent.

522
01:09:09,704 --> 01:09:13,696
-I didn't expect her so young.
-You don't trust me right?

523
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:17,979
We can't have another day
passing by without talking.

524
01:09:18,343 --> 01:09:22,461
Don't worry. Finish with Angela,
I have proof.

525
01:09:23,023 --> 01:09:26,902
For example, at the ceremony
I didn't cry, you did.

526
01:09:26,902 --> 01:09:29,735
-Right.
-And you shouldn't have.

527
01:09:29,902 --> 01:09:31,938
Don't you believe me?

528
01:09:32,222 --> 01:09:36,373
I needed 10 years to get over
it. I finally made it.

529
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:41,533
Lydia, trust me,
it's over.

530
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,701
I travelled with Angela.

531
01:09:44,701 --> 01:09:48,249
The excuse was to write
a travel guide.

532
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:52,937
In reality, I wanted her
out of Madrid and drugs.

533
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:57,571
Madrid is hell. Our relationship
functioned outside it.

534
01:09:58,339 --> 01:10:01,939
After five trips,
I brought her to her parents...

535
01:10:01,939 --> 01:10:06,012
...who kept her away
from drugs and from me.

536
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,688
Did you still love her?

537
01:10:10,258 --> 01:10:14,251
I cried not being able to share
things with her.

538
01:10:15,258 --> 01:10:19,216
It's terrible to leave
a person you love so much.

539
01:10:19,897 --> 01:10:22,092
What a sad story!

540
01:10:22,697 --> 01:10:26,177
Love is a sad thing when
it ends...

541
01:10:26,177 --> 01:10:28,644
...as the song says.

542
01:10:28,976 --> 01:10:31,615
Marco, we need to talk afterwards.

543
01:10:31,896 --> 01:10:35,775
-We've been talking for an hour.
-You have, not me.

544
01:10:36,496 --> 01:10:38,487
You're right.

545
01:11:03,893 --> 01:11:07,090
My leg needs two months of therapy,
said the doctor.

546
01:11:07,413 --> 01:11:10,405
But you know what? I am glad
that bull hit me.

547
01:11:10,813 --> 01:11:14,052
Now I can stay with you until
you wake up.

548
01:11:14,052 --> 01:11:16,520
No one will take me away from you.

549
01:11:18,132 --> 01:11:21,408
We got back together,
a month ago...

550
01:11:22,691 --> 01:11:26,525
Lydia would tell you at the
wedding. She didn't in the end.

551
01:11:29,211 --> 01:11:31,930
It was you she cried for.

552
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:38,521
She called me to tell me
she cried for me.

553
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:42,650
Last time we spoke.

554
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:46,039
Now that I don't fight
due to injury...

555
01:11:46,169 --> 01:11:49,209
...I would like to stay
near her during the night.

556
01:11:49,209 --> 01:11:51,484
Like at your place.

557
01:12:27,765 --> 01:12:30,154
I am alone again.

558
01:12:34,285 --> 01:12:36,805
You were looking at her breasts.

559
01:12:36,805 --> 01:12:39,876
Difficult to avoid it.
They grow by the day.

560
01:12:40,204 --> 01:12:44,675
Benigno, I am thinking of taking
a trip... I have to work.

561
01:12:45,124 --> 01:12:47,160
And Lydia?

562
01:12:47,684 --> 01:12:50,072
She doesn't need me anymore.

563
01:12:52,003 --> 01:12:53,994
Did you break up?

564
01:12:54,923 --> 01:12:57,843
You can call it that way.

565
01:12:57,843 --> 01:13:01,801
I expected this, Marco.
Don't ask why, I just did.

566
01:13:03,322 --> 01:13:07,838
There was something in your
relationship that didn't function right.

567
01:13:08,162 --> 01:13:10,201
When are you going?

568
01:13:10,201 --> 01:13:13,079
Soon, but I'll see you before
I go.

569
01:13:13,361 --> 01:13:15,716
I am so sorry you are going.

570
01:13:20,481 --> 01:13:23,438
I am leaving, Benigno.
I'll see you soon.

571
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:29,269
She didn't have her period yet?

572
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:34,678
I am looking at the month's report.
She should have had it.

573
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:38,354
Yes, it's a bit late.

574
01:13:50,118 --> 01:13:53,996
Two weeks. That's a lot.
Are you sure she had it last month?

575
01:13:54,637 --> 01:13:58,755
I personally dealt with it.
It was when you had the flu.

576
01:13:59,917 --> 01:14:02,192
She seems a bit swollen.

577
01:14:02,597 --> 01:14:05,036
They often have abnormalities.

578
01:14:05,036 --> 01:14:08,312
For example, Lydia
doesn't have a period anymore.

579
01:14:08,796 --> 01:14:12,391
Anyway, we should tell Dr Vega.

580
01:14:30,234 --> 01:14:33,829
I brought some of my guides
for Alicia and you.

581
01:14:35,514 --> 01:14:37,822
I said goodbye to Lydia.

582
01:14:39,353 --> 01:14:43,551
I went to see Alicia, but they
didn't let me enter the room.

583
01:14:45,473 --> 01:14:47,622
Is there something wrong?

584
01:14:48,032 --> 01:14:50,990
No. Just some infection
that Alicia got.

585
01:14:51,192 --> 01:14:54,152
Can you drive me home?
I am done with work.

586
01:14:54,152 --> 01:14:57,232
-It's not serious, I hope.
-I don't know.

587
01:14:57,232 --> 01:15:01,144
They do some medical exams,
but they haven't told me anything.

588
01:15:02,151 --> 01:15:05,191
Brazil...

589
01:15:05,191 --> 01:15:07,421
...Turkey, Cuba.

590
01:15:08,271 --> 01:15:11,342
-I will read them to Alicia.
-They are guides.

591
01:15:11,790 --> 01:15:14,630
Yours. They must be good.

592
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:17,144
-Are you travelling alone?
-Yes.

593
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,466
I would like to talk to you
about this before you go.

594
01:15:20,789 --> 01:15:23,940
-About what?
-loneliness.

595
01:15:24,109 --> 01:15:26,384
I want to get married.

596
01:15:28,909 --> 01:15:31,948
-Alicia, of course!
-Benigno, you are nuts!

597
01:15:31,948 --> 01:15:34,988
We will get along better than
most couples.

598
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:38,219
-Why shouldn't I marry her?
-Because she is in a coma!

599
01:15:39,908 --> 01:15:43,456
Because she can't say 'yes'
in the church!

600
01:15:43,867 --> 01:15:47,427
Because, she is virtually dead!

601
01:15:47,427 --> 01:15:49,267
Get in the car!

602
01:15:49,267 --> 01:15:51,700
-What are you talking about?
-Get in the car!

603
01:15:57,706 --> 01:16:01,142
Your relationship with Alicia
is a crazy monologue!

604
01:16:01,426 --> 01:16:04,940
We often talk to PVS,
but we don't marry them.

605
01:16:05,505 --> 01:16:09,339
Incredible what you are saying.
I had a different opinion of you.

606
01:16:09,625 --> 01:16:13,140
Don't say or think about it
ever again!

607
01:16:13,704 --> 01:16:18,300
Promise!...If you say that to
anyone else, you will be in trouble!

608
01:16:20,384 --> 01:16:23,342
If that calms you down,
then I promise.

609
01:16:23,584 --> 01:16:26,623
-Regardless of how much you like her...
-You like her too, right?

610
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:28,693
Of course I like her.

611
01:16:29,263 --> 01:16:32,943
-She likes you too.
-She is virtually dead!

612
01:16:32,943 --> 01:16:36,822
She has no feelings about me,
you, or herself!

613
01:16:36,822 --> 01:16:39,336
Understand that!

614
01:16:44,342 --> 01:16:48,141
Our patient Alicia Roncero
was raped and is pregnant.

615
01:16:48,141 --> 01:16:51,421
Before I tell her father
I want you to tell me...

616
01:16:51,421 --> 01:16:54,461
...which bastard did it!

617
01:16:54,461 --> 01:16:56,820
Everyone is upset.

618
01:16:56,820 --> 01:17:00,529
You are responsible. Alicia
was on your floor.

619
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:03,931
Then allow me to explain the
situation.

620
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:06,735
Rosa, please.

621
01:17:07,899 --> 01:17:11,653
Alicia's period stopped
two months ago.

622
01:17:12,019 --> 01:17:16,012
I thought it was one month
initially, but I was wrong.

623
01:17:16,219 --> 01:17:19,255
It wasn't in last month's report.

624
01:17:19,458 --> 01:17:22,450
It says it was dealt with normally.

625
01:17:22,698 --> 01:17:25,895
I was down with flu
during that week.

626
01:17:26,858 --> 01:17:29,815
You wrote that.
Right, Benigno?

627
01:17:30,057 --> 01:17:33,094
-It is your typewriting.
-Yes, it was me.

628
01:17:33,297 --> 01:17:36,130
Why did you lie?

629
01:17:36,657 --> 01:17:39,097
I didn't want it to become a problem.

630
01:17:39,097 --> 01:17:42,532
On other occasions, the patients'
periods have also stopped.

631
01:17:43,776 --> 01:17:47,735
How come no one noticed?
Where is the night person?

632
01:17:47,936 --> 01:17:51,132
She can't come today.
She phoned.

633
01:17:51,215 --> 01:17:53,375
Didn't see notice anything strange?

634
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:57,607
She has problems at home.
A lot of nights she doesn't come.

635
01:17:57,815 --> 01:18:00,375
And who replaces her?

636
01:18:03,894 --> 01:18:06,966
I will tell Roncero
that his daughter...

637
01:18:07,294 --> 01:18:10,092
...is day and night with
a nutter?

638
01:18:10,174 --> 01:18:12,368
Lets calm down for a bit.

639
01:18:13,973 --> 01:18:19,047
Benigno, do you realise you
are the prime suspect?

640
01:18:19,893 --> 01:18:22,972
Why did you hide the first delay?

641
01:18:22,972 --> 01:18:27,170
What explanation do you have?
Would you ever harm Alicia?

642
01:18:27,412 --> 01:18:29,323
Definitely not!

643
01:18:34,691 --> 01:18:37,451
Last night I was
at the parkin lot...

644
01:18:37,451 --> 01:18:41,285
...and overheard a discussion
between Benigno and Marco.

645
01:18:41,371 --> 01:18:44,760
Benigno said he wanted to
marry Alicia.

646
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:48,964
Marco tried to change his mind,
but in vain.

647
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:54,090
Lots of couples, he said...

648
01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:57,445
...don'r get along
as well as him and Alicia.

649
01:18:59,529 --> 01:19:02,999
AFTER EIGHT MONTHS

650
01:19:18,727 --> 01:19:22,640
It was Lydia Gonzales' funeral
yesterday, at Almudena.

651
01:19:23,807 --> 01:19:29,039
The thirty-year old bullfighter
was in a coma since...

652
01:19:32,086 --> 01:19:35,006
Can I speak with
Benigno Martin?

653
01:19:35,006 --> 01:19:37,076
He doesn't work here anymore.

654
01:19:38,165 --> 01:19:40,395
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

655
01:19:40,765 --> 01:19:43,245
-And sister Rosa Lazaga;
-Who are you?

656
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:45,805
-Marco Zuloaga.
-I will put you through.

657
01:19:50,124 --> 01:19:53,082
-Who is it?
-Marco Zuloaga.

658
01:19:53,964 --> 01:19:57,004
I am calling from Jordan.
I found out about Lydia.

659
01:19:57,004 --> 01:19:59,437
I am sorry, Marco.

660
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:02,438
You should have called me.

661
01:20:03,843 --> 01:20:06,232
We had a lot of problems here.

662
01:20:06,483 --> 01:20:09,600
What happened? Benigno isn't
there anymore, I was told.

663
01:20:10,043 --> 01:20:13,079
Benigno is in jail.

664
01:20:15,922 --> 01:20:19,551
He is accused of raping Alicia.

665
01:20:22,001 --> 01:20:25,041
Help him. He has no one
the poor guy.

666
01:20:25,041 --> 01:20:27,081
Did you go see him?

667
01:20:27,081 --> 01:20:29,879
After what he did, I can't.

668
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:33,271
However he does need help,
and you are his friend.

669
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:36,826
-What prison is he in?
-In Zegovia.

670
01:21:25,665 --> 01:21:28,179
Wait for me here.

671
01:21:42,984 --> 01:21:46,344
-I want to see a prisoner.
-In the visting section.

672
01:21:46,344 --> 01:21:48,777
Through this door,on the left.

673
01:21:59,622 --> 01:22:02,622
I want prisoner Benigno Martin.

674
01:22:02,622 --> 01:22:05,622
It isn't a visting day,
but I will see whether...

675
01:22:05,622 --> 01:22:07,738
I am sorry, I can't hear you.

676
01:22:08,901 --> 01:22:11,261
It isn't a visiting day.

677
01:22:11,261 --> 01:22:15,049
And the lodger didn't ask
for a visit.

678
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:18,658
He doesn't know I am in Madrid.
I came today.

679
01:22:19,061 --> 01:22:22,291
-Are you a relative?
-A friend.

680
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:26,095
-Marco Zuloaga is my name.
-Can I see your I.D.?

681
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:32,647
-Can I call him?
-He will call you.

682
01:22:32,939 --> 01:22:36,409
I have changed number. Can you
give him the new one?

683
01:22:45,338 --> 01:22:47,378
And remember.

684
01:22:47,378 --> 01:22:50,654
Visiting days are Saturday
and Sunday.

685
01:22:50,978 --> 01:22:54,765
But the lodger should ask for
the visit.

686
01:22:55,057 --> 01:22:58,174
If he doesn't want to see you,
there is nothing we can do.

687
01:22:59,657 --> 01:23:03,615
And something else. We don't
have prisoners here...

688
01:23:04,616 --> 01:23:08,894
We don't have prisoners here,
we have lodgers.

689
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:46,607
Marco, is that you?

690
01:23:47,492 --> 01:23:51,690
I am glad to hear your voice.
I asked your visit on Saturday.

691
01:23:54,052 --> 01:23:56,281
-Where are you?
-Outside the clinique.

692
01:23:58,371 --> 01:24:02,284
Dr Vega told me everything.
How could you do it?

693
01:24:02,931 --> 01:24:06,048
Did you come back to Spain
to get on my back?

694
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:10,288
Do you need anything?
What should I bring you on Saturday?

695
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:13,890
I need information.
What do you know about Alicia?

696
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:16,120
They wouldn't say anything
from the clinique.

697
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:18,599
She is in a different one.
They don't know where.

698
01:24:18,689 --> 01:24:21,449
-I don't believe this.
-Neither do I.

699
01:24:21,449 --> 01:24:24,247
But I am not surpised they
won't tell us.

700
01:24:24,529 --> 01:24:27,965
-Are you still my friend?
-Of course. Since I am here.

701
01:24:28,169 --> 01:24:30,398
Then find out about Alicia.

702
01:24:30,768 --> 01:24:34,044
Whether she's alive, whether she gave
birth, whether the baby is alive...

703
01:24:34,248 --> 01:24:37,957
I need to know, Marco...
You understand, right?

704
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:44,804
I will try to...
Talk to you on Saturday...

705
01:24:46,807 --> 01:24:50,321
-Did you find out anything?
-I will. Be patient.

706
01:24:50,646 --> 01:24:55,766
I was, until the day she would
give birth. One month ago.

707
01:24:56,446 --> 01:24:58,721
You must wait.

708
01:25:04,685 --> 01:25:08,883
-What do you do during the day here?
-I work in the recovery room.

709
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:14,075
It's a new prison, few people.
It's quiet in here.

710
01:25:14,644 --> 01:25:18,000
-It doesn't look like a prison from outside.
-The problem is elsewhere!

711
01:25:18,444 --> 01:25:21,322
That I don't see Alicia.

712
01:25:22,004 --> 01:25:25,996
The doctor ki o Dr Roncero
say I am a psychopath.

713
01:25:29,283 --> 01:25:33,117
This is good for the trail, they say,
but I don't care about the trial.

714
01:25:33,482 --> 01:25:37,361
I need to see Alicia,
to find out how everything went.

715
01:25:38,002 --> 01:25:42,075
If this goes on, I don't
know what I am capable of doing!

716
01:25:42,282 --> 01:25:44,441
I am a psychopath, they say?
Then I will act like one!

717
01:25:44,441 --> 01:25:46,397
Don't say that, Benigno!

718
01:25:47,521 --> 01:25:51,753
And find me another lawyer.
The one I have despises me.

719
01:25:54,241 --> 01:25:58,313
I will rent my place so that
I can pay him.

720
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:01,760
I will rent it.
I am currently homeless.

721
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:05,036
Great. I am glad you will be
my tenant.

722
01:26:05,799 --> 01:26:09,712
I was thinking about you a lot,
especially during the nights.

723
01:26:10,479 --> 01:26:13,835
-Why during the nights?
-Because I study during the nights.

724
01:26:14,079 --> 01:26:16,751
I read all your guides.

725
01:26:16,918 --> 01:26:20,478
Like travelling with you
next to me...

726
01:26:20,478 --> 01:26:22,867
...telling me things.

727
01:26:23,158 --> 01:26:26,195
I liked Avan's the most.

728
01:26:26,438 --> 01:26:28,667
I became one with those people...

729
01:26:28,757 --> 01:26:31,794
...that have nothing
and invent everything.

730
01:26:32,757 --> 01:26:35,917
And you describing
the Cuban girl...

731
01:26:35,917 --> 01:26:38,836
...in front of her window
by the sea...

732
01:26:38,836 --> 01:26:40,872
...waiting in vain...

733
01:26:41,356 --> 01:26:44,428
...for something that will
never happen.

734
01:26:45,036 --> 01:26:47,994
I was thinking that woman is me.

735
01:27:05,994 --> 01:27:09,145
Good morning. I am Benigno's
friend.

736
01:27:09,674 --> 01:27:12,392
You are Marco, the Argentinian?

737
01:27:12,753 --> 01:27:17,383
Benigno called me.
Will you take his appartment?

738
01:27:18,193 --> 01:27:22,424
It will be dirty. He wouldn't
let me in to clean it.

739
01:27:23,872 --> 01:27:27,831
-And I didn't want any money...
-It's OK, I will take care of it.

740
01:27:28,112 --> 01:27:31,740
Shall I give you the key?...
I will go look for it...

741
01:27:38,231 --> 01:27:40,222
Did you see him?

742
01:27:41,311 --> 01:27:44,063
-How is he?
-Well.

743
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:49,190
Poor guy, he wasn't even lucky
during his imprisonment.

744
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:51,390
No publicity!

745
01:27:51,390 --> 01:27:55,507
No TV, no reporters.
No one came here.

746
01:27:55,989 --> 01:27:59,149
They didn't condescend!
And they show such garbage!

747
01:27:59,149 --> 01:28:01,219
I would give them an interview!

748
01:28:01,469 --> 01:28:03,982
The media is shit in this country!

749
01:28:04,148 --> 01:28:06,059
You are right.

750
01:28:06,548 --> 01:28:08,584
The keys...

751
01:28:09,148 --> 01:28:13,539
Anyway...Do you know why
Benigno is in prison?

752
01:28:13,988 --> 01:28:18,105
He is very quiet. He didn't say
a word last time he came.

753
01:28:18,667 --> 01:28:21,625
-Benigno is innocent.
-Yes, I know.

754
01:28:21,867 --> 01:28:24,779
-Innocent about what?
-I don't know.

755
01:28:25,147 --> 01:28:28,263
You do, but you don't want
to tell me.

756
01:28:33,226 --> 01:28:36,615
If you need something,
you know where I am.

757
01:30:30,215 --> 01:30:34,003
I was glad you stepped in
by yourself today, without crutches.

758
01:30:36,454 --> 01:30:39,214
-How did the exercise go today?
-Very well.

759
01:30:39,214 --> 01:30:41,374
-Were you tired?
-A lot.

760
01:30:41,374 --> 01:30:44,844
It doesn't matter. We will
do some extra exercises.

761
01:30:46,093 --> 01:30:48,766
We will do some stretches.

762
01:30:49,093 --> 01:30:52,768
-But I already did 100.
-We'll do a few more.

763
01:31:28,330 --> 01:31:31,002
I have an appointment with
Mr. Sainz.

764
01:31:35,329 --> 01:31:38,162
The boy was born dead.

765
01:31:38,289 --> 01:31:41,368
Alicia recovered.
Benigno hasn't found out.

766
01:31:41,368 --> 01:31:44,599
In his condition,
he could do something crazy.

767
01:31:45,008 --> 01:31:48,683
I can't lie to him.
He is my only friend.

768
01:31:49,168 --> 01:31:52,607
I will tell him.
I have no problem.

769
01:31:52,607 --> 01:31:56,156
Alicia is still in coma and
the baby dead, I will say.

770
01:31:56,327 --> 01:31:59,167
But you don't tell him anything.

771
01:31:59,167 --> 01:32:03,762
-Can he bail out?
-Very difficult, and expensive.

772
01:32:31,284 --> 01:32:33,963
-You are wet.
-A little.

773
01:32:33,963 --> 01:32:38,639
Be careful not to catch a cold.
Drink hot milk with honey.

774
01:32:49,802 --> 01:32:53,590
Since I am here,
I like rainy days.

775
01:32:56,081 --> 01:32:58,641
DId you see the new lawyer?

776
01:33:01,401 --> 01:33:05,360
He was here...
he told me everything...

777
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:11,320
-I will loose, right?
-Frankly, yes, you will.

778
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:14,756
At least nothing happened to
Alicia during birth.

779
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:19,311
It's the only thing that consoles
me and gives me hope.

780
01:33:21,039 --> 01:33:23,234
Are you ok, Benigno?

781
01:33:26,999 --> 01:33:30,468
I would like to hug you
so much, Marco.

782
01:33:31,918 --> 01:33:35,478
But I have to ask for a meeting
face to face.

783
01:33:35,478 --> 01:33:37,514
I tried.

784
01:33:38,997 --> 01:33:41,955
They asked me whether you are
my lover.

785
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:46,156
I didn't dare say 'yes' since
that would annoy you.

786
01:33:46,397 --> 01:33:50,708
It wouldn't annoy me at all.
You can say whatever you want.

787
01:33:51,036 --> 01:33:54,506
I have hugged very few people
in my life.

788
01:34:47,592 --> 01:34:49,423
Message!

789
01:34:53,391 --> 01:34:57,145
I was very happy to see you
and say goodbye today.

790
01:34:57,991 --> 01:35:00,551
They won't let me get
out of here...

791
01:35:00,551 --> 01:35:03,463
...or they will put me
somewhere else

792
01:35:03,751 --> 01:35:06,390
I don't want to live
without Alicia...

793
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:10,009
...without being able to hold
not one pin of hers.

794
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:12,929
Therefore I will escape.

795
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:16,928
I didn't tell you so that you
won't stop me.

796
01:35:17,099 --> 01:35:19,613
I hug you firmly, Marco.

797
01:35:36,737 --> 01:35:39,649
In Zegovia...
Yes, in prison...

798
01:35:58,935 --> 01:36:02,245
I urgently need to see Benigno Martin.

799
01:36:02,535 --> 01:36:05,493
It's a matter of life and death.

800
01:36:05,775 --> 01:36:08,814
The warden is waiting for you
in his office.

801
01:36:08,814 --> 01:36:11,408
Me? Where is his office?

802
01:36:11,854 --> 01:36:14,368
The guard will accompany you.

803
01:36:21,453 --> 01:36:24,013
Empty your pockets, please.

804
01:36:37,092 --> 01:36:39,401
Wait, don't run.

805
01:36:45,331 --> 01:36:47,242
In there at the end.

806
01:36:48,691 --> 01:36:51,762
Good morning. I am
Marco Zuloaga.

807
01:36:52,410 --> 01:36:55,686
Benigno Martin left this
letter for you.

808
01:37:02,889 --> 01:37:05,089
Dear Marco...

809
01:37:05,089 --> 01:37:09,048
It's still raining, and this
is a good sign.

810
01:37:10,369 --> 01:37:13,917
When Alicia had the accident,
it was raining too.

811
01:37:14,408 --> 01:37:18,088
I am writing to you a few
minutes before I escape.

812
01:37:18,088 --> 01:37:21,608
I hope, with all these,
to fall in a coma as well...

813
01:37:21,608 --> 01:37:23,803
...and to be near her.

814
01:37:24,527 --> 01:37:26,995
You are my only friend.

815
01:37:27,447 --> 01:37:31,235
I am leaving you the house
I prepared for me and her.

816
01:37:33,087 --> 01:37:37,398
Wherever they take me, come to
see me and talk to me.

817
01:37:37,966 --> 01:37:41,675
Tell me everything, without
hiding anything.

818
01:37:42,486 --> 01:37:44,681
Goodbye, my friend.

819
01:38:01,884 --> 01:38:05,638
I took these from him and these
I found at his cell.

820
01:38:14,203 --> 01:38:16,478
You must sign here.

821
01:38:25,522 --> 01:38:27,638
Benigno, it's me.

822
01:38:30,081 --> 01:38:34,438
Alicia is alive...
You woke her up.

823
01:38:38,041 --> 01:38:42,192
I got your message and ran
immediately to tell you...

824
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:44,874
...but it was too late.

825
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,436
I put a pin of Alicia
in your pocket.

826
01:38:50,399 --> 01:38:52,959
And a photo of hers.

827
01:38:53,719 --> 01:38:56,711
And a photo of your mother.

828
01:38:57,559 --> 01:39:00,835
So that they can be with you
in eternity.

829
01:40:22,471 --> 01:40:26,100
Like wild waves. The male on top,
the female below.

830
01:40:26,391 --> 01:40:28,062
I will bring some water.

831
01:40:56,188 --> 01:40:58,099
Are you ok?

832
01:41:00,947 --> 01:41:02,903
I don't know...

833
01:41:05,307 --> 01:41:07,662
I am much better now.

834
01:41:20,426 --> 01:41:22,859
Come on, lets go inside.

835
01:41:27,865 --> 01:41:29,856
You tremble.

836
01:41:31,465 --> 01:41:32,943
Why?

837
01:41:43,863 --> 01:41:46,223
-What did you tell her?
-Noting.

838
01:41:46,223 --> 01:41:48,223
I saw you talking.

839
01:41:48,223 --> 01:41:51,579
She asked if I am ok, and I
thanked her.

840
01:41:53,422 --> 01:41:57,859
You will see me around.
I live near the dancing school.

841
01:41:58,582 --> 01:42:01,415
In Benigno's place?

842
01:42:02,022 --> 01:42:05,411
-Why do you stay there?
-Benigno is dead.

843
01:42:10,461 --> 01:42:13,612
One day, we should talk.

844
01:42:13,941 --> 01:42:17,376
Yes, and it will be simpler
than you thought.

845
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:19,691
Nothing is simple.

846
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:23,172
I am a dancing teacher, and nothing is simple.
and nothing is simple.
