1
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:45,556
Okay, here goes.

2
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:48,796
Okay, we're on.

3
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:54,243
You're looking at a chair
because l'm sitting in it.

4
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:58,838
My name is Nick Halloway.
I'm not sick, and l'm not crazy.

5
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:03,317
But l am invisible.
How can l make you believe this?

6
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:07,001
Okay, try this.

7
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:11,396
See? No strings.

8
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:16,124
Wait a minute.
This ought to do it for you.

9
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:35,284
I'm making this tape because in hours,
l could be dead. This is my last chance.

10
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:40,280
I've got a hell of a story to tell.
Let's get right to it.

11
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:43,244
It all started on a Tuesday in March.

12
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:47,476
Thirty-six inches packed powder?

13
00:03:47,805 --> 00:03:50,842
Can you get me in the Aspen Lodge
through Sunday?

14
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:54,122
Just a single with a king-size bed.
You never know.

15
00:03:54,285 --> 00:03:56,845
Great. Thanks, Cheryl.
I'll get back to you.

16
00:03:57,005 --> 00:03:58,961
Boykin asked
if you saw the announcement. . .

17
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,037
. . .of the proposed
Allied-Security oil merger.

18
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:06,039
Kaplan called about Magnascopics.
You've got the OPEC thing.

19
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:10,039
Staff meeting's Thursday. You haven't
begun that oil-shale analysis for Roger.

20
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:12,799
-Shall l continue?
-What oil-shale analysis?

21
00:04:12,965 --> 00:04:16,275
-You are here.
-Roger. Come on in.

22
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:20,598
I've been trying to get you all afternoon.
I've spent the day on this.

23
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:24,758
I strongly recommend the company
examine oil-shale positions.

24
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:30,036
Great. Well, everything else okay, huh?
Still going out with Denise Lee?

25
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:33,320
Went out with her once.
Where you been, Rog?

26
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:37,160
You are the biggest bullshit artist
l've ever worked for.

27
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:40,920
Thank you, Cathy.
In fact, take the rest of the day off.

28
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:43,474
-I'm going to my club.
-What?

29
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:47,439
Magnascopics tomorrow.
A car will be at your apartment at 7:30.

30
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:51,962
-You promised Kaplan you'd cover for him.
-How will l get through this? You go.

31
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,685
-You gave him your word.
-I was drunk.

32
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:57,234
-Get Moynihan to cover.
-You're committed.

33
00:04:57,405 --> 00:05:01,080
What about my commitments?
My family, my relatives?

34
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:02,598
You don't have any.

35
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:09,118
The day was panning out
like any other day in my life.

36
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:13,483
But what was about to happen
was gonna change it forever.

37
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:18,039
The Academy Club is one of the last
private men 's clubs in San Francisco.

38
00:05:18,205 --> 00:05:21,675
The place railroad tycoons
and robber barons would hang out...

39
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:24,040
...eat roast beef,
hire the occasional whore...

40
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:26,765
...and discuss how much
they stole that day.

41
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:30,122
I use the tennis courts.
I like the bar.

42
00:05:31,805 --> 00:05:35,115
No. Bad shoulder.
No depth.

43
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,918
Put me down for a dime
on St. John's/Villanova.

44
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:41,201
I want the over on Duke/Carolina.

45
00:05:41,605 --> 00:05:43,596
All right. Thanks, Buzz.

46
00:05:44,165 --> 00:05:47,714
Somebody's trying to get your attention.
It's Mr. Talbot.

47
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:51,517
Don't look, Patrick.
Just pretend you don't see.

48
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:57,244
-Thanks, Patrick.
-Hi, Nick.

49
00:05:58,045 --> 00:06:00,275
Hi, George.
How's the spastic colon?

50
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:03,278
-What you doing?
-Oh, writing my resignation.

51
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:06,118
I'm gonna start a foster home
for poor kids.

52
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:09,357
Girls, mostly. Late teens, early 30s.
I need a family.

53
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:12,085
Yeah. Come join us.
I'm here with some of the gang.

54
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:16,921
-No, l can't tonight.
-Come on. Come on, one drink, all right?

55
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,996
It's just Ellen and some pals of hers.

56
00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:22,794
Alice Monroe, my sister Amy's friend
from Cornell, back from Brazil.

57
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:27,197
-I've got an early morning. I can't--
-Before you bail, just have a look.

58
00:06:35,485 --> 00:06:37,396
Well, maybe for a minute.

59
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:40,874
-You know everybody, don't you?
-Hi, Ellen.

60
00:06:41,045 --> 00:06:43,320
-Hi, Nick.
-Oh, Alice Monroe.

61
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:46,204
I'd like you to meet Nick Halloway.
This is Alice.

62
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,003
-Hi, Nick.
-Nice to meet you.

63
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:51,043
-Where have you been hiding?
-Where have you been?

64
00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:53,594
-You got a haircut. Looks good.
-Like this?

65
00:06:53,765 --> 00:06:55,721
Alice produces
Smithsonian documentaries.

66
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:58,035
Oh, really? l love the Smithsonian.

67
00:06:58,205 --> 00:07:00,765
It's one of my favorite institutions.

68
00:07:01,405 --> 00:07:04,124
So, what kind of documentaries
do you produce?

69
00:07:04,285 --> 00:07:07,800
Anthropological stuff, traditional cultures,
cosmologies.

70
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:11,002
Cosmologies, love them.

71
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:13,963
It's one of my favorite ologies.
Patrick.

72
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:18,881
You went to law school, and you were
practicing in Boston. What happened?

73
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:22,754
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer.
It just wasn't for me.

74
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:27,237
-It'll be lndiana/UNLV. Maybe Arkansas.
-Carolina.

75
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,839
The leap into film, what did you do?
Raise money?

76
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:32,280
-Your firm represented someone?
-No, l quit.

77
00:07:32,445 --> 00:07:36,438
I got a job as a production assistant
for a public television station.

78
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:40,280
-Next thing you know, l'm in the jungle.
-I think it's gonna be UNLV.

79
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:42,515
Primitive, huh?

80
00:07:43,285 --> 00:07:47,836
There's only a few places in the Amazon
that could still be considered virgin.

81
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:52,718
So, what did you miss most
when you were down there?

82
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:55,441
Hot showers, cheeseburgers.

83
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:01,473
I think Seton Hall will go all the way.

84
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:08,756
-I hate TV.
-Me too.

85
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:12,720
-I like music.
-I love jazz.

86
00:08:13,365 --> 00:08:17,643
-I hate weight lifters.
-Narcissists.

87
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:24,274
-Love skiing.
-Love the ocean and the woods.

88
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:27,560
I love blond hair.

89
00:08:30,445 --> 00:08:33,437
I love garlic.

90
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:42,838
Nick.

91
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:46,634
-What are we doing?
-I hope it's foreplay.

92
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:53,713
-We should get back.
-Yeah. Yeah. We should get back.

93
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:58,558
Let's not do anything
cheap and meaningless.

94
00:08:58,725 --> 00:09:00,602
Okay. What do l owe you?

95
00:09:01,885 --> 00:09:03,955
You couldn't afford it.

96
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:29,317
-Ciao.
-Nice to have you back.

97
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,794
-Thanks, George.
-See you soon.

98
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:35,196
-Making an early night, Nick?
-I thought we were having dinner.

99
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:39,074
-I promised l'd meet somebody.
-Really? Maybe l'd better drop you.

100
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:43,363
Actually, dinner's not such a great idea
with all this work l gotta do.

101
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:49,557
You like ltalian? We could go to Fiorello's.
It's dark. It's quiet.

102
00:09:49,725 --> 00:09:52,523
I'd love to,
but l do have to meet somebody.

103
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:54,004
You're kidding.

104
00:09:54,165 --> 00:09:57,077
-I thought you were putting them on.
-No.

105
00:09:57,245 --> 00:10:00,123
Want to meet for lunch Friday
at the Brasserie?

106
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:02,515
Lunch? Let's go to Maui.

107
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,153
Nick, we have plenty of time.

108
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,123
You're right.

109
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:12,799
-Am l gonna regret meeting you?
-You already do.

110
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:21,200
In a way, it was all Alice's fault.

111
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:25,199
Maybe if l hadn 't met her that night,
and she hadn 't been so beautiful...

112
00:10:25,645 --> 00:10:29,923
...l wouldn 't have gone back to the bar
and drunk myself silly.

113
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:34,124
The next morning, l was never
so hung-over in all my life.

114
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:44,155
It is my pleasure to present the chairman
of our scientific advisory board...

115
00:10:44,325 --> 00:10:49,001
...and the Sidney Leavitt professor
of theoretical physics at Berkeley...

116
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:51,474
...Dr. Bernard Wachs.

117
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,556
Welcome.
Accustomed as we are today...

118
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:07,083
. . .to think of magnetism as the vector of
spins and orbits of subatomic particles. . .

119
00:11:07,245 --> 00:11:11,477
. . .it is often with astonishment
that we discover how different men. . .

120
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:14,677
. . .viewed the set of phenomena
that we group together. . .

121
00:11:14,845 --> 00:11:16,915
. . .under the term "magnetism. "

122
00:11:17,205 --> 00:11:22,643
The Greek philosopher Thales,
as early as the sixth century B.C. . .

123
00:11:22,805 --> 00:11:28,755
. . .observed the extraordinary ability
of lodestones to attract other pieces. . . .

124
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:36,994

A vector quantity that specifies. . .

125
00:11:37,165 --> 00:11:40,237
. . .direction and magnitude
of the force in our magnetic field. . .

126
00:11:40,405 --> 00:11:43,636
-. . .may temporarily convert the. . . .
-Fifteen minutes in. . .

127
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:49,323
. . .and we're not up to the birth of Christ?
Call me when he gets to the lnquisition.

128
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:50,998
Excuse me.

129
00:12:11,325 --> 00:12:14,442
Excuse me.
Is there a men's room around here?

130
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:17,324
Yes. Just down the hall there.

131
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:19,919
-Oh, shoot!
-Thank you.

132
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:35,797
Hello?

133
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:43,634
Stay back.

134
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:06,997
Ten minutes. Ten minutes.
I'll be as good as new.

135
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:13,520
Von Erxlebren's design breakthrough
allowed an enhanced--

136
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:18,033
What?

137
00:13:31,485 --> 00:13:34,363
Get out! Get out!
Run for it!

138
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:08,200
Is it not true, Mr. Jenkins,
that you were in Honduras...

139
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:11,402
. . .the same day Dr. Mendoza fell
to his death. . .

140
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:14,523
. . .from the 21 st floor
of the Hotel Presidente?

141
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:18,084
Mr. Chairman, l was in Honduras
as a consultant. . .

142
00:14:18,245 --> 00:14:21,237
. . .to the Pan-American
Democratic Relief Organization.

143
00:14:22,205 --> 00:14:24,560
You're not paid by the CIA?

144
00:14:25,725 --> 00:14:28,558
You were never a station chief
code-named Scorpion?

145
00:14:28,725 --> 00:14:31,159
You weren't in Germany
two years ago. . .

146
00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:35,284
. . .when a defecting chief chemist
for IG Farben, a Dr. Hans Bodnik. . .

147
00:14:35,445 --> 00:14:40,235
. . .disappeared and later fell to his death
from the Hotel Continental in Würzburg?

148
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:43,396
Would you repeat the question?

149
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:51,321
How did those whores put me
in Würzburg?

150
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:54,761
Don't worry about that.
We got a case-red priority.

151
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:59,237
Something's happened at Magnascopics
in Santa Mira. We need you in California.

152
00:14:59,405 --> 00:15:01,236
-Read this.
-What is it?

153
00:15:01,405 --> 00:15:04,636
It's not what it is,
it's what it isn't.

154
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,798
Come on. I'm not sure if. . . .

155
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:14,084
I don 't know how long l was unconscious,
and l don 't remember waking up.

156
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:18,079
But when l did,
l was in a nightmare.

157
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:20,600
Nothing around me was right.

158
00:15:20,805 --> 00:15:25,435
I could see pieces of the office,
Jagged edges of the building.

159
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:28,036
Was l hallucinating?

160
00:15:28,245 --> 00:15:31,794
Because all laws of physics
seemed to have been suspended.

161
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:50,321
Your attention, please.

162
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:54,761
If you are entering the site,
use caution.

163
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:58,076
While the building has the appearance
of being severely damaged...

164
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:02,397
... we have found no debris.
No sign of a blast pattern.

165
00:16:02,565 --> 00:16:06,638
The building remains intact.
YouJust can 't see certain parts of it.

166
00:16:06,805 --> 00:16:11,083
Possibly some molecular instability
has made certain areas transparent.

167
00:16:11,245 --> 00:16:16,319
Proceed carefully. You may come
in contact with invisible surfaces.

168
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:23,554
Get some water to Decon!

169
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:27,684
All personnel,
use caution entering the site.

170
00:16:27,845 --> 00:16:32,680
There are indications the building
may still be in flux.

171
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:44,843
Everything inside me said,
"Get out. "

172
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:49,681
But when l moved,
l found myself floating in a dream.

173
00:16:49,845 --> 00:16:53,076
I walked across the room,
or what was left of it.

174
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:58,114
I tried to re-orient myself.
What had happened?

175
00:16:58,525 --> 00:17:02,154
Had l died?
Was l a ghost?

176
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:19,318
I had to think.
What was real and what wasn 't?

177
00:17:19,765 --> 00:17:24,156
Where--? Where was my hand?
l couldn 't see my hand. Oh, God

178
00:17:24,325 --> 00:17:26,202
What had happened to me?

179
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:30,523
I needed help, but who?

180
00:17:31,445 --> 00:17:33,754
I had to call somebody.

181
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:38,116
And then l knew.

182
00:17:38,845 --> 00:17:41,120
It wasn 'tJust the building.

183
00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:43,637
It was me.

184
00:17:45,245 --> 00:17:48,715
Jesus.
I walked over to the mirror.

185
00:17:48,885 --> 00:17:52,480
I was right. There was no reflection.
My body, clothes, everything was gone.

186
00:17:52,645 --> 00:17:54,636
I was invisible.

187
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:08,961
I see it too.

188
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:22,802
Throw some light up there.

189
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,442
Hey!

190
00:18:31,965 --> 00:18:34,035
Hey, help me!

191
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:38,516
Help!

192
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,235
Help! Help!

193
00:18:41,405 --> 00:18:46,638
What's the matter with you? Help!
Jesus, can't you see me?

194
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:52,075
You, help! Right here!
Right here!

195
00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:58,475
Help me!
Jesus, what have they done to me?

196
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:06,240
-Maybe he's dead.
-No, he's breathing.

197
00:19:06,405 --> 00:19:09,044
I can see the blanket
moving up and down.

198
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:14,718
What we could do
with this freak on our team.

199
00:19:14,885 --> 00:19:17,558
Talk about undercover.
The contracts we'd haul down.

200
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:20,444
Forget it.
First place he's going is some lab.

201
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:23,324
They'll be cutting him and shoving tubes
up his ass for years.

202
00:19:23,485 --> 00:19:26,955
-What?
-Keep your mouths shut. All of you.

203
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,844
Wait a minute. Who are you guys?
What happened to me?

204
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:31,916
Why can't l see myself?

205
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,958
-Let's get him to the trailer fast.
-No!

206
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:38,436
You stay back!

207
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:43,004
I'm not going anywhere till l know
who you are and what's going on.

208
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:47,795
I'm sorry. My name is David Jenkins.
May l know yours?

209
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,717
Harvey.

210
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:52,676
Well, Harvey. . .

211
00:19:52,845 --> 00:19:57,282
. . .I know the last few hours must have
been incredibly painful and disorienting.

212
00:19:57,445 --> 00:20:01,723
We need to get you medical attention,
a complete physical workup--

213
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:04,353
I heard all about your physical workup.

214
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:08,313
I'd just as soon not have my balls
floating in a petri dish, thank you.

215
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:12,683
Don't panic. You've been through
an extraordinary trauma. You're confused.

216
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:16,235
No shit! Hey, stop that!
Stop doing that!

217
00:20:18,445 --> 00:20:21,084
-I want to call my lawyer.
-Now, listen to me.

218
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:25,833
You're in a state of molecular flux.
You could be dying.

219
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:29,315
Now, if you wanna live,
you're gonna have to trust us.

220
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:33,241
-We're a team of scientists--
-I don't believe you!

221
00:20:39,085 --> 00:20:41,394
Harvey, you have to understand. . .

222
00:20:41,565 --> 00:20:44,762
. . .I don't have the right
to let you leave here on your own.

223
00:20:44,925 --> 00:20:50,204
If something should go wrong, if anything
should happen to you, l'd be responsible.

224
00:20:50,925 --> 00:20:54,474
Some important decisions have to be
made about what's right for you. . .

225
00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:58,524
. . .and these decisions have to be made
by qualified people.

226
00:20:58,845 --> 00:21:01,359
I have to keep control
of the situation. . .

227
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:05,723
. . .for your sake and for everyone's.
I think you can understand that.

228
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:11,796
-Harvey?
-Yeah.

229
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:19,077
Close the gates!
Seal the area!

230
00:21:30,605 --> 00:21:32,516
It's going! Take cover!

231
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:35,075
-It's gonna blow!
-Don't look at it!

232
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:37,395
Move! Move!

233
00:21:58,565 --> 00:22:01,398
IJust kept running and running.
I must have run 10 miles.

234
00:22:01,565 --> 00:22:04,637
I have no idea.
IJust wanted to get away from them.

235
00:22:07,245 --> 00:22:09,964
Hey! Help!

236
00:22:11,645 --> 00:22:14,796
By now l was in such a state of shock,
l was panicky.

237
00:22:14,965 --> 00:22:18,116
I couldn 't remember anything,
couldn 't remember what happened.

238
00:22:18,285 --> 00:22:20,594
I forgot l was invisible.

239
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:50,321
I'll prove something to you.

240
00:22:57,565 --> 00:22:59,123
Okay?

241
00:22:59,285 --> 00:23:05,394
You didn't say something to my face,
so l got something to say to your face.

242
00:23:05,565 --> 00:23:06,759
I--

243
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:11,478
You can't fire me.
Well, l'll fight you. You can't fire me.

244
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:15,001
I'll fire you, so come on,
to my face, say it.

245
00:23:15,165 --> 00:23:19,158
So, what's up? Just say it to my face.
I'll get you two back.

246
00:23:19,325 --> 00:23:23,113
You can't fire me!
l'll fire you back!

247
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:26,358
Taxi!

248
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:32,563
Can you take me to San Francisco?

249
00:23:34,845 --> 00:23:36,563
Sure.

250
00:23:59,725 --> 00:24:02,603
I'm gonna need some money upfront.

251
00:24:12,605 --> 00:24:14,482
Here. Here you go.

252
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:23,682
I'm gonna take a catnap. Can you wake
me up when we get to the bridge?

253
00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:33,921
The first thing l had to do was call
my doctor. No, no. That was stupid.

254
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:37,839
How would an internist help me?
l needed a goddamn magician.

255
00:24:39,885 --> 00:24:42,797
Excuse me. Is this a cab?

256
00:24:44,445 --> 00:24:49,883
-Did you say something?
-Yes. Sacramento and Powell.

257
00:25:01,245 --> 00:25:04,396
Hey, could you pull over here?

258
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:33,116
-Oh, God.
-Oh, l'm sorry. Oh, God.

259
00:25:36,525 --> 00:25:38,356
Oh, baby.

260
00:25:40,325 --> 00:25:44,921
Driver, could you take me to San Rafael,
please? l changed my mind.

261
00:26:02,365 --> 00:26:06,074
I had to get into my apartment,
where l could study myself...

262
00:26:06,245 --> 00:26:08,361
...figure out what had happened.

263
00:26:23,765 --> 00:26:27,963
Maybe it would wear off in a couple
of days, but what if it didn 't?

264
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:30,878
What if l evaporated into nothing?

265
00:26:43,965 --> 00:26:47,116
He may have overheard something
that made him apprehensive.

266
00:26:47,485 --> 00:26:51,444
-The explosion might have frightened him.
-Anything could happen to him.

267
00:26:51,605 --> 00:26:53,516
He may be dead already.

268
00:26:53,685 --> 00:26:58,201
Well, l'm gonna have to take this up
with Parcells at Langley.

269
00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:02,034
I don't think you want to do that.

270
00:27:06,845 --> 00:27:10,121
-What do you mean?
-Show him the data. Give him anything. . .

271
00:27:10,285 --> 00:27:15,723
. . .but say nothing about the man.
Let's keep this private, huh?

272
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:18,516
Now, think about it.

273
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:23,282
You say one word, it becomes the deputy
director's show and not yours anymore.

274
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:25,481
We're out of the loop.

275
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:31,074
On the other hand, if we grab him quick,
we become his control.

276
00:27:31,245 --> 00:27:33,839
We're the only ones that know he exists.

277
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:38,317
The single most exotic intelligence asset
on the planet is ours. . .

278
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:40,916
. . .and ours alone.

279
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:43,122
What do you need?

280
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:48,438
--noon at an apartment in the 300 block
of South Jefferson in Daly City.

281
00:27:48,605 --> 00:27:52,598
The mother said she left her son
in Murphy's care for a few hours.

282
00:27:52,765 --> 00:27:54,118
Murphy lived in....

283
00:27:54,285 --> 00:27:57,721
Felt like l hadn 't eaten in a week,
which is easier said than done...

284
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:00,524
... when you can 't even
see your own hands.

285
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:07,475
Fire officials say the blaze
was caused by a faulty space heater...

286
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,523
...in the second-floor apartment
on Diego Street.

287
00:28:10,685 --> 00:28:14,473
The single-family unit
was being shared by eight people.

288
00:28:14,645 --> 00:28:19,799
The heat had been turned off for
three weeks for failure to pay a gas bill.

289
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:23,640
There was an accident today
at the Magnascopics Laboratory.

290
00:28:23,805 --> 00:28:26,365
A spokesman
for the nuclear regulatory agency says:

291
00:28:26,525 --> 00:28:30,598
"Although the laboratory was the site
of nuclear-fusion research...

292
00:28:30,765 --> 00:28:34,804
... there was no radioactive material
and no risk of contamination. "

293
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:37,354
-No inJuries were reported.
-Bullshit.

294
00:28:37,525 --> 00:28:41,438
Authorities are keeping the area
cordoned off as a precaution.

295
00:28:41,605 --> 00:28:44,119
An Oregon man
is being arraigned today...

296
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:47,322
...on charges he killed a man
nine years ago....

297
00:28:47,485 --> 00:28:49,680
Oh, Jesus.

298
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:11,117
-What happened?
-Where have you been?

299
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:14,277
For a moment,
l thought it had all been a dream.

300
00:29:14,445 --> 00:29:16,163
But that didn 't last.

301
00:29:16,325 --> 00:29:19,954
I saw the news about the fire
at Magnascopics and l was worried.

302
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:23,117
The food l hadn 't thrown up
the night before had evaporated.

303
00:29:23,285 --> 00:29:24,843
I was as transparent as ever.

304
00:29:25,005 --> 00:29:28,202
-Oh, shit.
-Nick. Nick.

305
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,083
I'm here.

306
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:33,960
-Sort of.
-So, what happened out there?

307
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:39,159
Cathy, l've been sick as a dog.
What's this about a fire?

308
00:29:39,325 --> 00:29:44,274
You didn't go, then? You're sick? Well,
l'm sorry. Can l send you some soup?

309
00:29:44,445 --> 00:29:49,519
No. No. No. I'll be fine. Just reschedule
all my appointments for Monday.

310
00:29:49,685 --> 00:29:52,279
-Thanks, Cathy. Bye.
-Bye.

311
00:29:53,885 --> 00:29:55,955
It's Roger. Where are you?

312
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:59,674
Should we be long or short on Allied?
The stock is going crazy.

313
00:29:59,845 --> 00:30:01,437
Would you call me, please?

314
00:30:05,485 --> 00:30:07,601
Hi, Nick. It's Alice.

315
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:12,919
I'm calling to confirm our lunch on Friday.
Am l being too forward about this?

316
00:30:13,085 --> 00:30:16,964
What am l talking about? We've already
been to the ladies ' room together.

317
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,240
See you Friday.

318
00:30:21,165 --> 00:30:25,522
Nick. David Jenkins. Global Devices.
Perhaps we met last night.

319
00:30:25,685 --> 00:30:28,802
We got your name from the register.
There will be an inquiry...

320
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:32,753
...into what happened at Magnascopics
last night. We'll need a signed statement--

321
00:30:33,805 --> 00:30:37,241
I knew that voice.
Who the hell did he think he was kidding?

322
00:30:37,405 --> 00:30:39,282
These guys were fast.

323
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:41,720
Robin, it's Nick Halloway.
It's important.

324
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:45,594
Mr. Cebron 's in court today,
but l know he wants to talk to you.

325
00:30:45,765 --> 00:30:49,394
-He does?
-Are you in trouble with the government?

326
00:30:49,565 --> 00:30:52,557
-Why would l be?
-That's what Mr. Cebron asked...

327
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:55,797
...but they were being real vague.
Oh, can you hold on?

328
00:30:59,405 --> 00:31:01,236
Robin, they're paging my flight.

329
00:31:01,405 --> 00:31:04,522
-Tell him l'll call him when l get to Dallas.
-Dallas?

330
00:31:06,085 --> 00:31:10,601
Who the hell were these guys?
How did they find me so quickly?

331
00:31:12,365 --> 00:31:15,243
I had to get out of there fast.

332
00:31:15,405 --> 00:31:19,318
The first thing l had to do was remember
where l put myJacket and shoes.

333
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:56,600
Keep that thing low so when l mark him,
you don't get off a headshot.

334
00:31:59,965 --> 00:32:01,956
We're at the front door.

335
00:32:03,925 --> 00:32:05,563
Zebra Team standing by.

336
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:07,078
-Alpha?
-Ready.

337
00:32:07,245 --> 00:32:08,473
-Delta?
-In place.

338
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:10,963
-Baker Team?
-Set up.

339
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,719
-You've got a green light.
-Let's take this asshole.

340
00:32:55,965 --> 00:32:59,275
-This is Jenkins. I'm at the front door.
-Shit.

341
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:01,879
-Give me the status on the roof.
-No movement yet.

342
00:33:04,285 --> 00:33:06,719
Come on, come on, come on.

343
00:33:17,885 --> 00:33:20,035
-Is it all right to open up?
-Yes, ma'am.

344
00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:22,594
May l come in to use
the phone, please?

345
00:33:24,925 --> 00:33:29,521
He seemed such a nice young man,
that Mr. Halloway. Has he killed someone?

346
00:33:35,605 --> 00:33:37,561
Oh, l must have slipped.

347
00:33:44,685 --> 00:33:46,084
Halloway!

348
00:33:51,205 --> 00:33:52,684
I got him.

349
00:34:02,325 --> 00:34:03,314
Oh, shit.

350
00:34:03,485 --> 00:34:05,237
California Street.

351
00:34:12,765 --> 00:34:15,154
Mr. McCaren, you all right, sir?

352
00:34:15,325 --> 00:34:18,840
-What happened?
-I think something hit me.

353
00:34:19,005 --> 00:34:22,122
-What was it? You sure you're okay?
-My back.

354
00:34:23,445 --> 00:34:25,037
Who are you guys?

355
00:34:35,485 --> 00:34:37,476
Halloway, are you there?

356
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:44,637
If you're hurt,
l'd like to help you.

357
00:34:47,325 --> 00:34:51,603
Halloway, listen to me.
You can't escape.

358
00:34:52,765 --> 00:34:58,044
Believe me. Wherever you go,
whoever you tell, it all comes back to me.

359
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:04,845
You must trust us, Nick. We're the only
people that can give you your life back.

360
00:35:05,005 --> 00:35:06,358
We're all you have.

361
00:35:09,805 --> 00:35:14,083
It's lonely, isn't it, Nick?
When you're a freak?

362
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:15,394
Fuck you.

363
00:35:25,565 --> 00:35:27,840
For hours,
l wandered the streets of the city.

364
00:35:28,005 --> 00:35:30,360
I was a fugitive,
afraid of getting caught.

365
00:35:30,525 --> 00:35:34,040
I kept imagining Jenkins leaping out
at me from every dark corner.

366
00:35:38,645 --> 00:35:40,044
Taxi!

367
00:35:47,485 --> 00:35:52,195
As a child, when l'd dream about being
invisible, l thought it would be so easy.

368
00:35:52,365 --> 00:35:56,916
I could do what l want,
go where l want and take what l want.

369
00:35:57,085 --> 00:35:59,041
But that's the catch.

370
00:35:59,205 --> 00:36:03,118
No matter how hungry l was,
l couldn 't give myself away.

371
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:11,278
My purse! My purse!

372
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:20,997
I was starving and exhausted.

373
00:36:21,165 --> 00:36:24,077
Somehow, l found myself
in the alley behind my club...

374
00:36:24,245 --> 00:36:27,043
...and l figured it would do
for the time being.

375
00:36:28,965 --> 00:36:32,594
In a building this size,
there would be places to hide.

376
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,993
Finally, l formulated a plan.

377
00:36:37,565 --> 00:36:39,760
I'd get to this Dr. Wachs
from Magnascopics...

378
00:36:39,925 --> 00:36:41,324
...show him what had happened.

379
00:36:41,485 --> 00:36:46,001
And whatever he did to get me this way,
l would demand he undo.

380
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,563
Wachs?
Magnascopics doctor?

381
00:37:11,725 --> 00:37:14,398
Last Wednesday?
l was inside when it happened.

382
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:18,240
-I beg your pardon?
-Give me a dollar. They could be watching.

383
00:37:18,925 --> 00:37:21,564
Does the word "invisible"
mean anything to you?

384
00:37:26,965 --> 00:37:31,243
-Where's the professor?
-In the park, taking a stroll.

385
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:42,159
-Come on, will you? We're gonna lose him.
-Relax.

386
00:37:42,565 --> 00:37:47,639
But this is astounding.
I never dreamed. They never told me.

387
00:37:47,805 --> 00:37:49,477
Open your coat,
show me the rest.

388
00:37:49,645 --> 00:37:52,443
-Trust me. It's all the same.
-Oh, dear God.

389
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:54,994
There's got to be
another psychotron, right?

390
00:37:55,165 --> 00:37:57,395
Can't you just take me there
and turn me back?

391
00:37:57,565 --> 00:38:01,877
I'll forget the whole thing. No lawsuits,
no recriminations. No harm, no foul.

392
00:38:02,045 --> 00:38:06,641
Our research had nothing to do with
invisibility. This was a random reaction.

393
00:38:06,805 --> 00:38:08,921
-Don't say this.
-What are you doing here?

394
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:11,201
You should be with me,
with us, in the lab.

395
00:38:11,365 --> 00:38:15,040
We must replicate the variables,
begin to explore how this happened.

396
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:18,242
"Begin to explore"?
That's not good enough!

397
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:21,158
-You gotta help me now!
-It's gonna take time.

398
00:38:21,325 --> 00:38:25,398
I don't have time! l want
my molecules back! Look at me!

399
00:38:25,565 --> 00:38:26,998
It's him.

400
00:38:31,285 --> 00:38:32,798
-You gotta turn me back.
-No!

401
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,836
Oh, God. You bastards!

402
00:39:07,765 --> 00:39:08,754
Shit!

403
00:39:18,365 --> 00:39:21,835
Would you bring me a phone,
please? Thanks.

404
00:39:25,805 --> 00:39:28,273
Hi, this is Alice Monroe.
I'm meeting Nick...

405
00:39:28,445 --> 00:39:31,005
...for lunch at the Brasserie.
Is he on his way?

406
00:39:31,165 --> 00:39:33,759
I don 't have you in his book
or l would have phoned.

407
00:39:33,925 --> 00:39:36,837
Mr. Halloway's out sick.

408
00:39:38,285 --> 00:39:40,753
-I hope it's nothing serious.
-No, it's the flu.

409
00:39:40,925 --> 00:39:43,120
I'll tell him you called.
What's your number?

410
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:48,277
Yeah. It's Alice Monroe.
555-9290.

411
00:39:48,445 --> 00:39:49,434
-Sure.
-Thanks.

412
00:39:49,605 --> 00:39:51,323
-Bye.
-Bye.

413
00:39:53,405 --> 00:39:58,115
I guess l'll be eating alone.
Can l see a menu, please? Thanks.

414
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:03,959
I am the Sidney Leavitt professor
of theoretical physics, a member. . .

415
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:07,640
-. . .of the National Academy of Science!
-Shut up!

416
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:12,117
-I'll ask again. Where is he?
-I've already told you, l don't know.

417
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,674
Why didn't somebody tell me
there was a man inside?

418
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:17,723
When are you planning to make
contact with him again?

419
00:40:17,885 --> 00:40:20,445
Exactly under whose authority
are you operating?

420
00:40:20,605 --> 00:40:24,075
I know the deputy director,
and Dick Parcells would never sanction. . .

421
00:40:24,245 --> 00:40:27,920
. . .that stunt your goons pulled in the park
this afternoon.

422
00:40:28,805 --> 00:40:34,004
Now, Dr. Wachs, what were you
really doing at Magnascopics?

423
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:37,555
I find it hard to believe
that this was all simply an accident.

424
00:40:37,725 --> 00:40:39,636
I am aghast at this.

425
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:43,161
There's an invisible man loose in the city.
I want to find him too. . .

426
00:40:43,325 --> 00:40:45,475
. . .so, what are we doing here?

427
00:40:49,885 --> 00:40:53,764
-Take off your jacket.
-Why? What are you gonna do?

428
00:40:53,925 --> 00:40:57,395
Don't worry, doc.
This won't hurt you a bit.

429
00:40:57,565 --> 00:41:00,238
Make a fist.
I said, make a fist.

430
00:41:00,405 --> 00:41:03,363
-Let me know when he's ready.
-Why are you doing this to me?

431
00:41:03,525 --> 00:41:07,962
-All l know is that he exists.
-And that's already too much.

432
00:41:08,805 --> 00:41:12,161
"Never been married,
parents both deceased. "

433
00:41:12,325 --> 00:41:15,954
The guy's got a few friends,
but not real close to any of them.

434
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:21,074
Not exactly a workaholic either.
He kind of plays it fast and loose.

435
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,713
It's always difficult
with people like this.

436
00:41:23,885 --> 00:41:28,754
No strong emotional ties,
no political beliefs, no particular interests.

437
00:41:29,885 --> 00:41:33,195
As a matter of fact,
when you think about it. . .

438
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:38,439
. . .the man has the perfect profile.
He was invisible before he was invisible.

439
00:41:38,605 --> 00:41:44,760
Look, he's not a pro. He's alone.
He's desperate. He'll crack.

440
00:41:47,645 --> 00:41:50,079
Where are you hiding, Halloway?

441
00:42:14,525 --> 00:42:16,834
I could only sleep
out of sheer exhaustion.

442
00:42:17,005 --> 00:42:19,917
And when l did sleep, l would dream.
Weird, crazy dreams...

443
00:42:20,085 --> 00:42:23,964
...about what might have been
and what l had lost.

444
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,956
Welcome, Nick.

445
00:42:28,885 --> 00:42:31,843
-Oh, Nick. Hi.
-Hello, Nick.

446
00:42:32,005 --> 00:42:34,644
Nick, good to see you.
Good to see you.

447
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:36,477
Hi, Nick.

448
00:42:37,085 --> 00:42:38,404
Hi, Nick.

449
00:42:40,885 --> 00:42:44,116
-Nick, you charmer.
-Right this way.

450
00:43:35,845 --> 00:43:37,403
Looking for something, Nick?

451
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:56,277
It was about time l did look for something.
Maybe l could turn the tables on them.

452
00:43:56,445 --> 00:44:00,199
Find out what they knew about
my condition and use it to my advantage.

453
00:44:25,805 --> 00:44:27,955
-Who's up?
-Vinny's up. Sit down and deal.

454
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:30,685
Yeah. I owe the pot $2.

455
00:44:32,445 --> 00:44:34,675
Red dog, red dog,
face of red dog.

456
00:44:34,845 --> 00:44:38,042
Nothing is wild, and it starts with Vin.
Six dollars in the pot.

457
00:44:39,965 --> 00:44:41,717
Pass? No pass?

458
00:45:23,685 --> 00:45:27,121
Congressman Davis called
for a third time.

459
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:31,959
Singleton called from L.A. Iooking
for Wachs. I said what you told me to.

460
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:34,161
If we can't find this dude
for six months. . .

461
00:45:34,325 --> 00:45:37,317
. . .is he gonna keep us
operational that long?

462
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:42,240
Singleton's weak and he's unreliable,
but he knows the value of the prize.

463
00:45:42,405 --> 00:45:45,124
So let's start
with surveillance reports.

464
00:45:45,285 --> 00:45:47,924
-Comments?
-Okay, phone calls. . . .

465
00:46:41,021 --> 00:46:42,420
Welcome.

466
00:46:47,501 --> 00:46:51,380
I often sit here like this
at the end of the day, in darkness. . .

467
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:56,296
. . .and imagine what it must be like.
Were you conscious when it happened?

468
00:46:57,261 --> 00:47:02,540
Did you feel yourself change?
Did you pray?

469
00:47:05,421 --> 00:47:09,573
I've been worried about you, Nick.
Is everything all right?

470
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:17,576
How long have you been here?

471
00:47:18,221 --> 00:47:22,931
Long enough to learn things about you
l might tell my friends at the Chronicle.

472
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:28,379
You don't have any friends
at the Chronicle, Nick.

473
00:47:29,301 --> 00:47:31,974
Besides, we both know that
when you go to the press. . .

474
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:34,609
. . .you become the last thing
you want to be:

475
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:36,612
A circus attraction.

476
00:47:36,781 --> 00:47:39,454
-Now, l told you. It all comes back to me.
-Bullshit.

477
00:47:41,021 --> 00:47:43,535
You answer to people.
I heard.

478
00:47:43,701 --> 00:47:47,330
Maybe l'll call Washington
and talk to a guy named Singleton.

479
00:47:48,061 --> 00:47:49,414
Let's say you do.

480
00:47:49,581 --> 00:47:54,336
What do you think you could control the
moment you make your presence known?

481
00:47:55,141 --> 00:47:59,180
And if l work with you,
l suppose things would be different.

482
00:47:59,341 --> 00:48:03,459
I could come and go as l please.
Put your goddamn hands on the desk!

483
00:48:05,461 --> 00:48:10,899
Now get a grip on yourself, Nick.
Listen to what we're offering you.

484
00:48:11,061 --> 00:48:15,976
-In exchange for what?
-For your services to your country.

485
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:21,530
You have a wider obligation now.
You can be of immeasurable value to us.

486
00:48:23,581 --> 00:48:25,378
I'm not doing your spying.

487
00:48:26,141 --> 00:48:30,578
Suppose we'd had you,
an invisible agent, in 1 939.

488
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,733
Maybe there wouldn't
have been a Second World War.

489
00:48:33,901 --> 00:48:37,416
What are you saying? You mean
l would have killed Hitler for you?

490
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:43,497
I mean maybe you could have saved
30 million lives. Changed history.

491
00:48:43,661 --> 00:48:49,372
Now, assassination, anything at all, is
entirely ethical if you're on the right side.

492
00:48:56,301 --> 00:48:58,940
Now you listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

493
00:48:59,101 --> 00:49:02,696
I've lost everything but my soul,
and you won't take that away from me.

494
00:49:02,861 --> 00:49:06,695
Whatever l become, it'll be my choice,
not yours. Is that clear?

495
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:10,217
We're prepared to give you
anything you want, everything you need.

496
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:16,616
But you have to understand, if you
won't work with us, l can't let you live.

497
00:49:18,061 --> 00:49:21,895
I don't sleep well. I can see through
my eyelids, through the top of my head.

498
00:49:22,061 --> 00:49:23,813
I get walleyed!
l get bat-shit!

499
00:49:29,381 --> 00:49:31,770
Don't you ever touch me again.

500
00:49:39,501 --> 00:49:41,378
I'll kill him. I swear to God.

501
00:49:43,301 --> 00:49:46,850
-Back off.
-Do what he says.

502
00:49:49,141 --> 00:49:50,540
Move it.

503
00:49:57,581 --> 00:49:58,650
Nick.

504
00:49:59,581 --> 00:50:04,894
Contrary to what you might think,
l am not without feelings.

505
00:50:06,901 --> 00:50:10,655
Oh, God. Don't you see, we're
in this together, Nick, you and l?

506
00:50:10,821 --> 00:50:14,177
We're not so terribly different.
We're iconoclasts.

507
00:50:15,621 --> 00:50:17,930
Think of the adventure
we could have together.

508
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:20,774
Yeah, we can go to Frontierland.

509
00:50:27,261 --> 00:50:30,059
-See you, Dave.
-Oh, Nick--

510
00:50:39,181 --> 00:50:40,580
Give me that.

511
00:50:49,501 --> 00:50:51,492
I had to get out of San Francisco.

512
00:50:51,661 --> 00:50:55,336
Jenkins would never stop searching,
and l wasn 't safe at the Academy Club.

513
00:50:55,501 --> 00:50:59,335
He knew my patterns. It'd only be a
matter of time before he'd catch me there.

514
00:50:59,501 --> 00:51:02,095
There were hotels,
but they would be more dangerous.

515
00:51:02,261 --> 00:51:06,539
I couldn 't go back to my apartment,
and l couldn 't risk confiding in anyone.

516
00:51:07,741 --> 00:51:10,699
That's when l decided
on George's summerhouse.

517
00:51:12,141 --> 00:51:16,339
Three quarts of vodka, 3 quarts of
Scotch. Do you have any bouillon cubes?

518
00:51:16,501 --> 00:51:20,733
Yeah, for soup or broth.
You know, chicken, beef, vegetable.

519
00:51:21,221 --> 00:51:26,693
Well, which is clearest? Clearest.
Which is most transparent?

520
00:51:26,861 --> 00:51:30,820
I'm looking for clear foods here.
No coloring. Easy to digest.

521
00:51:30,981 --> 00:51:34,212
My doctor says l gotta eat
clear foods. I'm all gas.

522
00:51:34,661 --> 00:51:37,255
Hold on a minute, will you?
What's that, George?

523
00:51:39,341 --> 00:51:43,812
Mr. Talbot says, could you please charge it
to his account? 37 Beachfront Lane.

524
00:51:43,981 --> 00:51:47,860
Thank you very much. Yeah,
tell the kid to come in the front door.

525
00:51:49,741 --> 00:51:51,652
Anybody home?

526
00:52:24,461 --> 00:52:25,894
Hello?

527
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,060
Hey, dickwad.

528
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:56,736
I had to put the old Nick Halloway
behind me.

529
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:02,135
I'd create a new identity,
go underground.

530
00:53:02,701 --> 00:53:03,895
-Morning.
-Morning.

531
00:53:04,061 --> 00:53:07,497
Get myself a secure place
where Jenkins would never find me.

532
00:53:08,901 --> 00:53:10,539
I could play the market
by phone.

533
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:15,138
All l needed was a name on a brokerage
account and a few bucks to start with.

534
00:53:15,301 --> 00:53:18,259
I would become the invisible tycoon,
and then....

535
00:53:18,421 --> 00:53:20,412
Then l would make them pay.
All of them.

536
00:53:20,581 --> 00:53:24,654
They would rue the day
they tangled with Nick Halloway.

537
00:53:37,101 --> 00:53:38,693
Wow, George. It's beautiful.

538
00:53:38,861 --> 00:53:40,931
Yeah. Everybody needs a place
to get away.

539
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:43,899
-Recharge the batteries.
-If you can get here.

540
00:53:44,061 --> 00:53:47,417
-We got here, didn't we?
-Yeah, we did, but that traffic. . . .

541
00:53:47,781 --> 00:53:49,339
Now half the day is gone.

542
00:53:53,781 --> 00:53:55,658
Get in. We'll drive
back to the city.

543
00:53:57,501 --> 00:53:59,492
Shit, George.
What are you doing here?

544
00:53:59,661 --> 00:54:03,176
-Just forget it. We're here, all right?
-That's what l said.

545
00:54:03,341 --> 00:54:07,971
God! The silence.
And the air out here.

546
00:54:08,781 --> 00:54:11,739
It makes me think of children
and the Fourth of July.

547
00:54:11,901 --> 00:54:15,337
I like it better in the wintertime.
It gets so crowded in the summer.

548
00:54:15,501 --> 00:54:19,938
This is the first chance l've had to relax
since l've been back. Thanks, George.

549
00:54:20,101 --> 00:54:22,854
It's so stuffy in here.

550
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:26,814
It smells like somebody had a fire.

551
00:54:32,701 --> 00:54:36,057
-Subletting to someone?
-What the hell is going on?

552
00:54:36,221 --> 00:54:41,011
-I haven't been here since January.
-I think we should have a look around.

553
00:54:42,381 --> 00:54:44,531
Is there a gun in the house?

554
00:55:00,941 --> 00:55:03,057
Goddamn it!

555
00:55:05,421 --> 00:55:07,651
Somebody's been
wearing my clothes!

556
00:55:09,341 --> 00:55:12,014
-This is certainly peculiar.
-What?

557
00:55:12,181 --> 00:55:16,094
Everything's here, my hidden key
is missing, and the Jacuzzi's on the timer.

558
00:55:16,261 --> 00:55:19,810
All right, l don't like this.
This is making me very nervous.

559
00:55:19,981 --> 00:55:22,336
Whoever it is,
they left you fully stocked.

560
00:55:22,621 --> 00:55:24,771
Someone put food
in my refrigerator?

561
00:55:25,141 --> 00:55:28,656
There's some nice stuff in here.
There's a bottle of Montrachet.

562
00:55:28,821 --> 00:55:32,291
That's why l love Marin County.
You get a better class of burglar.

563
00:55:32,461 --> 00:55:36,136
It's gotta be my brother Chuck.
He must have split up with Kathleen again.

564
00:55:36,301 --> 00:55:37,939
Oh, great.

565
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:41,252
Wyborowa, 1 00 proof.
Chuck drink this?

566
00:55:41,661 --> 00:55:43,060
No.

567
00:55:45,421 --> 00:55:47,935
But l know who does.

568
00:55:49,581 --> 00:55:51,458
Halloway's in trouble.

569
00:55:51,621 --> 00:55:55,375
I spoke to a pencil pusher at some
government agency l never heard of.

570
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:58,214
He asked me the same
personal questions about Nick. . .

571
00:55:58,381 --> 00:56:01,498
. . .the SEC did when
Charlie Randolph got busted.

572
00:56:01,661 --> 00:56:04,095
There's a lot of confusion over
at Shipway & Whitman.

573
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:07,492
When a guy's been working there
1 0 years, suddenly disappears. . . .

574
00:56:07,661 --> 00:56:11,017
Roger Whitman's got auditors
looking to see if anything's missing.

575
00:56:11,421 --> 00:56:15,096
Do you really think he's a thief?
Didn't strike me as the embezzler type.

576
00:56:15,261 --> 00:56:19,459
Knowing Nick, he probably came here
to shack up with somebody's wife.

577
00:56:23,341 --> 00:56:27,573
-If that's all it was, he'd have called me.
-Why don't we just change the subject?

578
00:56:27,741 --> 00:56:31,416
Wherever he is, l'm sure Nick would love
to know we're talking about him.

579
00:56:31,581 --> 00:56:33,572
I think Halloway got
in a lot of trouble. . .

580
00:56:33,741 --> 00:56:37,893
. . .came out here, got nice and loaded
and walked into the ocean one day.

581
00:56:38,141 --> 00:56:41,816
Oh, come on. Nick's way too narcissistic
to kill himself.

582
00:56:42,061 --> 00:56:46,054
He'll probably wash up on the shore
one day all bloated and eaten by crabs.

583
00:56:46,221 --> 00:56:47,973
Richard!

584
00:56:48,821 --> 00:56:52,131
How can you say these things?
l thought you were Nick's friends.

585
00:56:52,301 --> 00:56:54,257
It's just--
I don't know.

586
00:56:54,421 --> 00:56:57,538
I got a real funny vibe,
like he's dead.

587
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:00,770
Well, why don't you have
a séance, Richard.

588
00:57:00,941 --> 00:57:06,652
Get out your Ouija board and call up
his spirit from the dead. I'm going to bed.

589
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:10,099
George. . . .

590
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:13,219
Seems to me, if he was gonna
commit suicide in my house. . .

591
00:57:13,381 --> 00:57:17,420
. . .he'd have the common decency to leave
a note or clean up a little first.

592
00:57:17,581 --> 00:57:21,574
Laugh, but l'd be careful mocking
what you don't understand.

593
00:57:21,741 --> 00:57:27,452
Nick! Nick! lf you're here with us,
Nick, give us a sign.

594
00:57:30,941 --> 00:57:33,057
Jesus! You bastard!

595
00:57:34,101 --> 00:57:36,251
He could have been channeling
through me!

596
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:39,980
Shit!

597
00:57:42,781 --> 00:57:44,533
Losing weight, Richard?

598
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:56,179
-So much for my good friends.
-Ellen, you wanna get the lights, please?

599
00:57:58,221 --> 00:58:00,940
-Night.
-Good night, you two.

600
00:58:02,381 --> 00:58:07,409
-Well, l'm not really that tired, are you?
-Yeah. I'm exhausted.

601
00:58:07,581 --> 00:58:11,494
Yeah, me too. Meet you on the beach
for a swim, bright and early?

602
00:58:12,541 --> 00:58:14,213
Sure. Sleep well.

603
00:58:20,741 --> 00:58:23,175
I remember feeling
an enormous sense of relief...

604
00:58:23,341 --> 00:58:26,378
... that she didn 't let him
into her room or kiss him.

605
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:33,097
Alice, are you decent?

606
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:37,574
Yes.

607
00:58:41,421 --> 00:58:45,812
-What is it?
-I was saving this till l sold my novel.

608
00:58:46,341 --> 00:58:48,536
You're a broker, not a novelist.

609
00:58:48,701 --> 00:58:53,217
Actually, l'm starting it this summer,
but l've got it all worked out in my head.

610
00:58:57,541 --> 00:59:00,613
This is really sweet,
but not tonight. I'm tired.

611
00:59:00,781 --> 00:59:03,818
Oh, just a short one. Come on.

612
00:59:04,301 --> 00:59:06,496
I really admire what you do.

613
00:59:07,021 --> 00:59:09,979
You're so unlike all the other women
l meet. You don't seem. . .

614
00:59:10,141 --> 00:59:12,780
-. . .caught up in the bullshit.
-Not yet anyway.

615
00:59:14,901 --> 00:59:16,459
Richard. . . .

616
00:59:17,461 --> 00:59:20,339
I'm really gonna have to say
good night.

617
00:59:20,501 --> 00:59:22,890
There's something l haven't told you.

618
00:59:23,181 --> 00:59:26,059
My wife left me three months ago.

619
00:59:27,781 --> 00:59:30,534
God, l'm such a mess.

620
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:33,420
Can't work, can't sleep.

621
00:59:43,501 --> 00:59:45,332
Richard, don't cry.

622
00:59:47,101 --> 00:59:49,251
I'm sure it's what's best for her.

623
00:59:49,421 --> 00:59:51,173
-And you.
-I need you!

624
00:59:51,341 --> 00:59:52,456
Richard, stop!

625
00:59:59,821 --> 01:00:01,493
I'm sorry.

626
01:00:01,701 --> 01:00:02,850
I'm sorry.

627
01:00:04,141 --> 01:00:05,733
I don't know what came over me.

628
01:00:05,901 --> 01:00:08,461
Maybe l misunderstood the situation
this weekend.

629
01:00:08,621 --> 01:00:10,691
I'm sorry if you thought
that we were. . . .

630
01:00:10,861 --> 01:00:13,250
-This is awkward.
-Just forget it happened.

631
01:00:13,421 --> 01:00:16,970
-Don't tell anybody l cried, okay?
-Okay.

632
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:19,099
Good night.

633
01:00:32,021 --> 01:00:35,013
About the time she fell asleep,
l stopped kidding myself.

634
01:00:35,421 --> 01:00:37,730
I was nuts about her.

635
01:00:42,701 --> 01:00:45,340
Why couldn 't l have met her a year ago?

636
01:00:45,861 --> 01:00:47,658
Probably would have messed it up.

637
01:00:47,821 --> 01:00:50,938
Right here. Set it down.
Quick. Hurry up.

638
01:00:51,101 --> 01:00:53,615
Yeah. Got it.

639
01:00:55,701 --> 01:00:57,419
-Wait a minute, George.
-What?

640
01:00:57,581 --> 01:01:01,051
Just pin my arms down.
Good. Okay.

641
01:01:01,901 --> 01:01:05,132
Wait a minute.
Could you just squeeze my butt?

642
01:01:05,301 --> 01:01:07,940
Yeah. That's it.
Okay.

643
01:01:08,821 --> 01:01:11,289
Wait a minute. No, George. . . .

644
01:01:11,661 --> 01:01:13,140
-Oh, l'm sorry.
-God.

645
01:01:13,301 --> 01:01:15,053
Fate was cruel.

646
01:01:15,221 --> 01:01:17,735
Well, that was memorable.

647
01:01:17,981 --> 01:01:20,097
Just give me 1 0 minutes.

648
01:01:20,261 --> 01:01:22,217
Look at the moon or something.

649
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,734
That night, l moved to the house
down the beach.

650
01:01:39,701 --> 01:01:42,818
The next day, l decided to call her.

651
01:01:47,221 --> 01:01:48,893
Hello?

652
01:01:50,341 --> 01:01:51,933
Hello?

653
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:54,171
-Alice?
-Yes.

654
01:01:54,341 --> 01:01:55,979
I need to talk to you.

655
01:01:56,141 --> 01:01:57,415
Who is this?

656
01:01:57,581 --> 01:02:00,698
It's Nick. Nick Halloway.
Remember me?

657
01:02:00,861 --> 01:02:03,091
Nick Halloway. Is this a joke?

658
01:02:04,461 --> 01:02:07,100
Listen, please don't tell anybody.

659
01:02:07,261 --> 01:02:09,650
I'm in the gray-and-white house
down the beach.

660
01:02:09,821 --> 01:02:11,971
I'll leave the door open for you.

661
01:02:12,141 --> 01:02:14,609
Can you come down here, please?

662
01:02:15,021 --> 01:02:16,773
Please, Alice.

663
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:51,099
Hello?

664
01:02:54,261 --> 01:02:56,092
Hello?

665
01:02:57,101 --> 01:02:58,819
Back here.

666
01:02:59,141 --> 01:03:00,699
Nick?

667
01:03:16,781 --> 01:03:20,774
Alice, don't be afraid.
It's me, Nick.

668
01:03:23,821 --> 01:03:27,496
-Were you in an accident?
-Yeah.

669
01:03:28,101 --> 01:03:30,854
Oh, what happened?
Were you burned or something?

670
01:03:31,021 --> 01:03:32,693
You want to sit down?

671
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:35,020
No.

672
01:03:53,061 --> 01:03:55,291
Where the hell did she run to?
Bodega Bay?

673
01:03:55,461 --> 01:03:56,814
It's been over two hours.

674
01:03:56,981 --> 01:03:59,814
You never know.
Attractive girl, jogging alone.

675
01:03:59,981 --> 01:04:04,259
I wouldn't worry about that, George.
She's as strong as an ox.

676
01:04:10,821 --> 01:04:13,813
I will not allow you to turn this
into another fiasco. . .

677
01:04:13,981 --> 01:04:16,859
-. . .Iike you did in lran.
-I'm getting the job done.

678
01:04:17,021 --> 01:04:19,740
I'm your section head!
l gave you this chance!

679
01:04:19,901 --> 01:04:23,814
Wachs was supposed to be
in Washington two days ago.

680
01:04:23,981 --> 01:04:26,370
-Where the hell is he?
-Wachs is sequestered.

681
01:04:26,541 --> 01:04:30,853
I'm not convinced he's been entirely
forthcoming with us. Now calm down.

682
01:04:31,021 --> 01:04:32,818
Trust me.

683
01:04:33,461 --> 01:04:35,850
All right. When do l get him?

684
01:04:36,021 --> 01:04:37,454
-When l'm convinced.
-No.

685
01:04:37,621 --> 01:04:42,570
-When do l get the invisible man?
-He may be here still, but l doubt it.

686
01:04:42,741 --> 01:04:46,450
-I'll get him soon. Very soon.
-I hope so. It's my ass on the line.

687
01:04:46,621 --> 01:04:50,694
I won't justify these expenditures
and methods with no results!

688
01:04:50,861 --> 01:04:52,931
I want him, and if l don't get him. . .

689
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:56,457
. . .you will be the next person
to disappear.

690
01:04:56,621 --> 01:04:59,658
Perhaps a reminder of the state of things
might be in order.

691
01:04:59,821 --> 01:05:02,540
I'm the one that kills people, Warren.
Not you.

692
01:05:02,701 --> 01:05:05,090
And if you screw up on me. . .

693
01:05:05,461 --> 01:05:08,100
. . .I will cut off your testicles,
fry them. . .

694
01:05:08,261 --> 01:05:11,571
. . .and Morrissey here
will have them for lunch.

695
01:05:22,061 --> 01:05:26,373
Nick, maybe this isn't
the right thing to do.

696
01:05:26,541 --> 01:05:30,011
Running and hiding.
Maybe you should be in the hospital.

697
01:05:30,181 --> 01:05:31,739
Not a chance.

698
01:05:31,901 --> 01:05:33,892
They know every move l make.

699
01:05:34,061 --> 01:05:37,497
Besides, there's nothing a doctor can do.
I feel normal.

700
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:42,173
I probably could use a shave,
but who's gonna notice?

701
01:05:46,781 --> 01:05:51,650
For years, women have been telling me
they can see right through me. Christ!

702
01:05:55,661 --> 01:05:57,891
Can l touch you?

703
01:06:02,181 --> 01:06:04,251
Oh, my God.

704
01:06:04,421 --> 01:06:06,457
Oh, my God.

705
01:06:07,221 --> 01:06:09,576
You do need a shave.

706
01:06:10,141 --> 01:06:13,258
I never realized how important it is
to be seen.

707
01:06:13,421 --> 01:06:15,332
You know? Acknowledged.

708
01:06:15,501 --> 01:06:18,538
You start questioning whether
you exist at all.

709
01:06:20,421 --> 01:06:22,059
Oh, Nick.

710
01:06:25,021 --> 01:06:28,172
I guess l forgive you
for standing me up.

711
01:06:28,621 --> 01:06:31,658
The last thing you want to do
is watch me eat.

712
01:06:34,381 --> 01:06:36,451
So how can l help you?

713
01:06:38,021 --> 01:06:43,015
Open a brokerage account, buy me 2000
shares of a stock called Allied Resources.

714
01:06:52,301 --> 01:06:56,817
-Having seconds?
-Yeah. I suddenly got hungry again.

715
01:06:57,301 --> 01:07:00,452
Must have been all that running
you did this afternoon.

716
01:07:00,621 --> 01:07:02,339
Must be.

717
01:07:08,621 --> 01:07:10,213
Well. . . .

718
01:07:10,381 --> 01:07:12,451
I'll just take this up to my room and. . . .

719
01:07:12,621 --> 01:07:15,454
I'm going to turn in early.
See you in the morning.

720
01:07:19,781 --> 01:07:24,457
I can get the broker to buy stock
without you having to spend any cash.

721
01:07:24,621 --> 01:07:25,690
Okay.

722
01:07:25,861 --> 01:07:29,854
You'll play what's called a "float. "
l trade through you and stockpile money.

723
01:07:30,021 --> 01:07:32,933
I cut you a check for half,
and l'm out of your life.

724
01:07:34,061 --> 01:07:36,291
Were you in here last night?

725
01:07:36,461 --> 01:07:39,419
Who? Me?
You mean last night, in this room?

726
01:07:39,581 --> 01:07:43,938
-Nothing would have happened, you know.
-Oh, hey, l know that.

727
01:07:44,301 --> 01:07:46,371
Did you hang around afterward?

728
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:50,614
Alice, l didn't see a thing.
I had my hands over my eyes.

729
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:53,496
Of course, you can see
right through them.

730
01:08:00,301 --> 01:08:02,053
Good night, George.

731
01:08:04,941 --> 01:08:07,660
This has been a terrific weekend.

732
01:08:07,821 --> 01:08:11,416
-I'm glad at least you got laid.
-Well, it was only Ellen.

733
01:08:13,101 --> 01:08:15,456
I think you're crazy, letting her stay here.

734
01:08:15,621 --> 01:08:17,737
She's a family friend.
Should l say no?

735
01:08:17,901 --> 01:08:21,177
You told me you heard two voices
coming out of her room.

736
01:08:21,341 --> 01:08:23,457
Suppose she's really schizo?

737
01:08:27,941 --> 01:08:29,579
Ah, George.

738
01:08:30,061 --> 01:08:33,849
You're the best. This will be the perfect
place for me to get some work done.

739
01:08:34,021 --> 01:08:36,615
I left the number of a good therapist.

740
01:08:36,781 --> 01:08:39,500
If you feel like talking,
she's very understanding.

741
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:41,856
She's helped Richard a lot.

742
01:08:42,141 --> 01:08:44,132
Thanks, George.

743
01:08:46,221 --> 01:08:48,655
Good to know
Richard's getting some help.

744
01:08:49,861 --> 01:08:53,570
Chuck, it's George.
Wanna hear a hot one?

745
01:08:53,741 --> 01:08:56,460
Guess who broke into my house
and ran up $500. . .

746
01:08:56,621 --> 01:09:00,057
. . .on food and booze on my accounts.
Nick Halloway.

747
01:09:01,381 --> 01:09:03,895
No, he's not dead. He's on a binge.

748
01:09:05,261 --> 01:09:07,900
-This is ridiculous.
-No, it is not.

749
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:10,495
Just let me finish.
You owe me a meal anyway.

750
01:09:10,661 --> 01:09:14,256
I'm sure you have better things to do,
places to go, people to see.

751
01:09:14,421 --> 01:09:16,935
First of all, l don't have
better things to do.

752
01:09:17,101 --> 01:09:19,695
I'm in between projects right now. . .

753
01:09:20,501 --> 01:09:22,776
. . .and l'm not seeing anybody.

754
01:09:22,941 --> 01:09:25,057
That's an understatement.

755
01:09:27,821 --> 01:09:31,814
It's a hell of a lot more comfortable
than that Ace bandage.

756
01:09:33,181 --> 01:09:35,411
It really works.

757
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:38,292
Oh, Nick, you have a face again.

758
01:09:39,181 --> 01:09:42,332
If l had eyes and teeth,
l'd be a whole head.

759
01:09:45,701 --> 01:09:47,339
It's nice to see you.

760
01:09:47,981 --> 01:09:50,211
It's nice to be seen again.

761
01:09:53,141 --> 01:09:56,338
Do you have any body makeup?
Dropped about 1 0 pounds.

762
01:09:56,501 --> 01:09:58,696
Bet l'd look great naked.

763
01:10:04,101 --> 01:10:06,057
Good evening. Two for dinner?

764
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:07,980
Yes, please.

765
01:10:10,461 --> 01:10:12,656
What's the matter?
ls something wrong?

766
01:10:13,621 --> 01:10:16,658
Of course not, sir. Right this way.

767
01:10:21,981 --> 01:10:25,496
See? Nobody's staring at you.

768
01:10:25,661 --> 01:10:28,937
Whatever they think, they certainly
don't think you're invisible.

769
01:10:29,101 --> 01:10:30,375
No.

770
01:10:31,261 --> 01:10:34,333
They're just seeing a beautiful blond
and a dead man.

771
01:10:35,701 --> 01:10:36,929
To Elvis.

772
01:10:47,501 --> 01:10:49,492
Oh, God.

773
01:10:49,661 --> 01:10:52,175
Maybe we do have
a little more work to do.

774
01:10:56,621 --> 01:10:59,897
You can go to any ball game
or movie for free.

775
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:04,215
You can look up girls' skirts,
hang around ladies' locker rooms.

776
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:09,300
-Go naked anytime you want.
-Almost have to now.

777
01:11:09,461 --> 01:11:14,012
Never worry about people saying
you look older or you should lose weight.

778
01:11:14,781 --> 01:11:17,818
You could have a brilliant career
as a bank robber.

779
01:11:20,581 --> 01:11:22,856
Jesus, l'm screwed.

780
01:11:25,061 --> 01:11:26,699
Nick. . .

781
01:11:28,341 --> 01:11:30,332
. . .I've been thinking.

782
01:11:31,141 --> 01:11:33,575
I'm not sure me playing
the stock market. . .

783
01:11:33,741 --> 01:11:38,053
. . .so you can live like a recluse
is the best solution to your problem.

784
01:11:38,701 --> 01:11:41,773
You got a better idea, Alice,
believe me, l'm interested.

785
01:11:41,941 --> 01:11:46,173
We could go to Washington. I know
some people who might be able to help.

786
01:11:46,381 --> 01:11:49,498
You expect me to trust a politician?

787
01:11:50,221 --> 01:11:52,177
No, you're right.

788
01:11:53,581 --> 01:11:55,811
But l want you to trust me.

789
01:11:58,381 --> 01:12:00,656
You're not alone anymore.

790
01:12:17,421 --> 01:12:18,854
Come on!

791
01:12:33,301 --> 01:12:36,771
It's them. My clothes
are on the corner of the couch.

792
01:12:42,861 --> 01:12:45,978
-Where are we going?
-Far away. Fast.

793
01:13:14,981 --> 01:13:17,051
May l have your attention, please?

794
01:13:17,221 --> 01:13:20,452
Announcing the departure
of train number seven....

795
01:13:39,301 --> 01:13:41,974
-Nick?
-I'm here.

796
01:13:47,341 --> 01:13:50,731
I got us a compartment
on the 7:30 train to San Diego.

797
01:13:50,901 --> 01:13:55,053
From there, we can figure out
how to get across the border to Mexico.

798
01:13:55,621 --> 01:13:58,613
That gives us about eight hours to kill.

799
01:13:59,181 --> 01:14:03,015
Look, they're gonna catch me, Alice.
Just get on the train. Go.

800
01:14:03,181 --> 01:14:05,251
Get away from me.
These guys are nuts.

801
01:14:05,421 --> 01:14:08,094
I'd never forgive myself
if something happened to you.

802
01:14:08,261 --> 01:14:12,300
I'm not scared. Whoever these guys are,
they can't control everything.

803
01:14:12,461 --> 01:14:15,578
God, l can't believe l got you into this.

804
01:14:15,741 --> 01:14:17,333
Forgive me.

805
01:14:17,581 --> 01:14:20,095
This is something l have to do
on my own.

806
01:14:33,781 --> 01:14:35,055
Alice. . .

807
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:37,576
. . .you're staring at my eyes.

808
01:14:38,781 --> 01:14:41,249
I think we should get out of the rain.

809
01:14:47,821 --> 01:14:49,413
What's happening to me?

810
01:14:49,581 --> 01:14:51,219
Don't.

811
01:14:52,181 --> 01:14:54,172
It's beautiful.

812
01:15:10,421 --> 01:15:14,130
Boy, how am l gonna tell my mom
about this?

813
01:15:16,781 --> 01:15:19,295
All the dirty parts l'd leave out.

814
01:15:20,821 --> 01:15:23,893
Just tell her you met a guy,
like him a lot. . .

815
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:27,576
. . .could be serious. He's transparent.

816
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:32,938
-Are you a Catholic?
-No.

817
01:15:33,101 --> 01:15:35,331
That could be a problem.

818
01:15:39,541 --> 01:15:41,418
You know something, Alice?

819
01:15:42,181 --> 01:15:45,253
If you were blind,
we'd make the perfect couple.

820
01:15:54,101 --> 01:15:56,137
May l have your attention, please?

821
01:15:56,301 --> 01:16:01,580
Now ready for departure,
train number 12, Pacific Coast....

822
01:16:05,301 --> 01:16:08,259
--now leaving on track number five.

823
01:16:09,341 --> 01:16:10,820
I'm in.

824
01:16:17,421 --> 01:16:19,332
That was easy enough.

825
01:16:25,421 --> 01:16:27,696
This isn't so bad.

826
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:35,815
I'm having second thoughts about Mexico.

827
01:16:35,981 --> 01:16:38,449
It's just not far enough away.

828
01:16:39,301 --> 01:16:42,691
With a fax and a computer,
l can trade from anywhere in the world.

829
01:16:42,861 --> 01:16:46,297
You mean anywhere?
Like Paris, Rome. . .

830
01:16:46,981 --> 01:16:47,970
. . .Bora Bora?

831
01:16:49,341 --> 01:16:51,297
Anywhere you want.

832
01:17:08,941 --> 01:17:11,136
Although l was thinking of Switzerland.

833
01:17:11,301 --> 01:17:14,771
A guy can get away with wearing
a ski mask all year round.

834
01:17:25,101 --> 01:17:26,693
Where's the next stop?

835
01:17:42,861 --> 01:17:44,340
Nick?

836
01:17:45,381 --> 01:17:47,611
-You asleep?
-No.

837
01:17:49,301 --> 01:17:52,259
I was just daydreaming
about a New York strip steak. . .

838
01:17:52,421 --> 01:17:56,539
. . .baked potato with sour cream
and chives and a hot fudge sundae.

839
01:17:56,701 --> 01:17:58,896
That sounds great.

840
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:03,937
I'll go get it.
Bring back a bowl of Jell-O for you.

841
01:18:08,141 --> 01:18:09,415
Thanks.

842
01:18:31,661 --> 01:18:33,538
Hello, Alice.

843
01:18:43,981 --> 01:18:45,937
Compartment C.

844
01:19:00,381 --> 01:19:01,780
Run!

845
01:19:01,941 --> 01:19:03,659
Nick!

846
01:19:03,821 --> 01:19:05,300
Run!

847
01:19:07,101 --> 01:19:08,454
Run!

848
01:19:11,341 --> 01:19:13,730
-Run!
-Halloway!

849
01:19:15,141 --> 01:19:16,620
Alice!

850
01:19:34,341 --> 01:19:36,935
Move! Move!
Get out of the way!

851
01:19:47,941 --> 01:19:49,579
No!

852
01:19:58,381 --> 01:20:01,578
The current must have swept me along
for half a mile.

853
01:20:01,861 --> 01:20:04,659
When l came to, l was being washed
toward a drainage pipe...

854
01:20:04,821 --> 01:20:06,971
...and throwing up a gallon
of river water.

855
01:20:13,621 --> 01:20:17,739
For all you knew, l'd drowned.
Your invisible man was dead.

856
01:20:17,901 --> 01:20:20,461
But l knew you had Alice.

857
01:20:25,421 --> 01:20:29,050
I was wrong to involve her in
the first place, Just like l was wrong...

858
01:20:29,221 --> 01:20:31,257
... thinking l could run away from this.

859
01:20:31,421 --> 01:20:34,060
I am what l am, Jenkins.
I know that now.

860
01:20:34,221 --> 01:20:36,496
Other people will too,
unless you let her go.

861
01:20:36,661 --> 01:20:40,017
You let her go, l'll come in.
That's the deal.

862
01:20:40,541 --> 01:20:42,418
I'll say this.

863
01:20:43,021 --> 01:20:45,819
Your friend Halloway
has a flair for the dramatic.

864
01:20:48,421 --> 01:20:51,413
I want you to be part of our team, Alice.

865
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:54,212
He needs you. We need you.

866
01:20:54,821 --> 01:21:00,134
Regardless of how it may seem, l've never
had anything but his best interest at heart.

867
01:21:00,781 --> 01:21:03,818
Where do they find people like you?

868
01:21:04,461 --> 01:21:06,691
It's him. He's on the phone.

869
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:14,055
Nick.

870
01:21:14,221 --> 01:21:17,736
I've got copies of that tape
in very safe hands right now.

871
01:21:17,901 --> 01:21:21,735
Anything happens to Alice,
they go to the networks, the papers.

872
01:21:21,901 --> 01:21:23,619
Use your imagination.

873
01:21:23,781 --> 01:21:27,490
Alice is here. She's absolutely fine.
What do you want me to do?

874
01:21:27,661 --> 01:21:31,017
I want to see her walk out of the building
and get in a cab.

875
01:21:31,181 --> 01:21:32,773
And what about you?

876
01:21:32,941 --> 01:21:35,978
Look out your window at the phone booth
on the corner.

877
01:21:37,861 --> 01:21:39,089
Yeah, l see you.

878
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:43,649
As soon as l see her out of your building
and in a cab, l give myself up.

879
01:21:43,821 --> 01:21:46,858
Try anything funny,
l do a striptease in the street...

880
01:21:47,021 --> 01:21:49,012
...l'll guarantee will make the news.

881
01:21:49,181 --> 01:21:52,014
Two minutes, Jenkins, starting now.

882
01:21:53,141 --> 01:21:54,130
Let's go.

883
01:22:08,901 --> 01:22:12,610
-I presume you've seen this.
-He's outside. We're five seconds away.

884
01:22:12,781 --> 01:22:15,932
-You murdered Wachs?
-He's holding me against my will.

885
01:22:16,101 --> 01:22:20,572
We've won, Warren. He's ours.
We can own the agency.

886
01:22:20,741 --> 01:22:23,653
You've lost it.
You don't know what you're doing.

887
01:22:23,821 --> 01:22:28,576
-I'm pulling the plug. Let her go!
-As soon as we make the switch.

888
01:22:45,701 --> 01:22:48,010
Just like we agreed, Nick.

889
01:22:49,061 --> 01:22:51,939
-Get the cab, Tyler.
-Yes, sir.

890
01:23:02,741 --> 01:23:05,096
Nick, l love you!

891
01:23:06,301 --> 01:23:09,418
Take her across the bridge
or something. Go!

892
01:23:31,621 --> 01:23:33,816
We had a deal, Nick.

893
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:36,456
You shouldn't have tried to run.

894
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:41,741
Hey, not so rough.

895
01:23:41,901 --> 01:23:43,573
Jesus.

896
01:23:51,181 --> 01:23:52,773
Where's Nick?

897
01:23:58,701 --> 01:24:00,612
Wait a minute.
Where are we going?

898
01:24:00,781 --> 01:24:02,612
The Bay Bridge.

899
01:24:03,941 --> 01:24:05,977
And l love you too.

900
01:24:07,301 --> 01:24:08,814
Nick?

901
01:24:09,221 --> 01:24:12,657
Nick. Oh, my God!

902
01:24:12,821 --> 01:24:14,174
Oh, look out.

903
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:17,890
That was George in the phone booth.
I called Jenkins with this.

904
01:24:18,061 --> 01:24:20,450
-You told George you were invisible?
-Of course not.

905
01:24:20,621 --> 01:24:24,136
Told him you we're in trouble.
Asked him for a big favor.

906
01:24:24,301 --> 01:24:26,371
God, l'm glad you're all right.

907
01:24:34,781 --> 01:24:36,578
I got him.

908
01:24:53,581 --> 01:24:56,141
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

909
01:24:56,781 --> 01:24:59,420
Nick, run! Run!

910
01:25:01,461 --> 01:25:03,019
Help!

911
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:04,853
Help!

912
01:25:16,621 --> 01:25:19,579
I've got him crossing Seventh Street
back toward Market.

913
01:25:26,381 --> 01:25:28,611
-Market Street.
-It's over!

914
01:25:28,781 --> 01:25:32,456
You hear me? l'm shutting you down!
l'm shutting you down!

915
01:25:44,861 --> 01:25:47,329
-He's heading south.
-Left on Fifth.

916
01:25:47,501 --> 01:25:51,130
Look. What about what Singleton said?
He signs the checks.

917
01:25:51,301 --> 01:25:54,213
Screw him. He's weak.
They're all weak.

918
01:25:54,381 --> 01:25:58,852
Think what Halloway will fetch.
The Germans, the Japanese, the Saudis.

919
01:25:59,181 --> 01:26:00,853
You'll be a rich man, Morrissey.

920
01:26:32,541 --> 01:26:35,180
Oh, my God! Look at that!

921
01:26:36,021 --> 01:26:37,693
What was that?

922
01:27:50,701 --> 01:27:53,898
You're a natural, you know.
Cool, imaginative, elegant.

923
01:27:54,781 --> 01:27:56,533
You've found your calling, Nick.

924
01:27:57,541 --> 01:28:01,978
I think we can work this thing out
together, you and l. Forgive and forget.

925
01:28:02,141 --> 01:28:07,169
Start again fresh, with a deeper sense
of respect for each other.

926
01:28:17,101 --> 01:28:19,934
Nick, l'll kill you if l have to!

927
01:28:23,661 --> 01:28:25,413
Now listen.

928
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:29,969
I'll commit every resource we have
to getting you back. . .

929
01:28:30,141 --> 01:28:32,257
. . .to making you whole again. . .

930
01:28:32,421 --> 01:28:35,458
. . .to reuniting you with Alice.
I swear.

931
01:28:35,621 --> 01:28:37,657
You swore you would kill me
a second ago.

932
01:28:37,821 --> 01:28:41,018
I think you're losing your marbles, Dave.
Get it straight.

933
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:02,736
Bit of a tight spot, Nick.

934
01:29:03,861 --> 01:29:05,692
Now, understand. . .

935
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,457
. . .if l can't have you. . .

936
01:29:08,701 --> 01:29:10,578
. . .no one can.

937
01:29:12,941 --> 01:29:14,977
I'm tired of the game, Dave.

938
01:29:16,461 --> 01:29:19,373
One step back, and it's all over.

939
01:29:19,781 --> 01:29:21,009
Now wait.

940
01:29:21,381 --> 01:29:24,373
I apologize for being rash.
It was stupid of me.

941
01:29:25,101 --> 01:29:29,060
You are the most unique human being
on the planet.

942
01:29:29,221 --> 01:29:31,496
You are walking history.

943
01:29:31,901 --> 01:29:34,699
Don't run away from it, man.
Embrace it!

944
01:29:41,461 --> 01:29:43,338
You'll never know what it's like.

945
01:29:43,501 --> 01:29:46,299
Don't. Now, don't, Nick.

946
01:29:47,021 --> 01:29:49,216
Don't come any closer!

947
01:29:49,421 --> 01:29:51,616
Come on, Nick.
Just give me your hand.

948
01:29:51,781 --> 01:29:54,500
-No! No! No!
-Give me your hand.

949
01:29:55,981 --> 01:29:58,449
Olé, you son of a bitch!

950
01:29:59,981 --> 01:30:01,334
Nick!

951
01:30:22,861 --> 01:30:26,137
Leave it alone. You didn't see anything.
You don't know anything.

952
01:30:26,301 --> 01:30:29,771
You didn't hear any of this.
Be smart.

953
01:30:31,341 --> 01:30:33,935
Clean it up. It never happened.

954
01:30:45,301 --> 01:30:47,974
-What did you lose, a contact lens?
-Nick!

955
01:30:48,141 --> 01:30:50,860
Don't say anything.
Let's just get out of here.

956
01:30:51,021 --> 01:30:53,455
-Look sad.
-Okay.

957
01:30:56,221 --> 01:30:58,860
My department had been alerted
to Mr. Jenkins' . . .

958
01:30:59,021 --> 01:31:01,330
. . .deteriorating emotional state.

959
01:31:01,501 --> 01:31:04,618
Of course, none of us
ever expected a tragedy like this.

960
01:31:04,781 --> 01:31:07,659
I think you can all appreciate how. . . .

961
01:31:09,741 --> 01:31:12,460
Oh, Nick.
I never want to lose you.

962
01:31:12,621 --> 01:31:14,816
You won't. I promise.

963
01:31:14,981 --> 01:31:18,053
It's keeping track of our kids
that's got me worried.

964
01:35:01,981 --> 01:35:02,970
