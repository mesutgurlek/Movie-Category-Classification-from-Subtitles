1
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:30,321
Keep it going! All right, shake it out!
Keep moving!

2
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:43,719
Shake it out!

3
00:03:04,207 --> 00:03:06,357
Are you talking to me?

4
00:03:25,407 --> 00:03:28,956
Me and my brother, itjust used
to be me and my brother.

5
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:31,118
We used to do things together.

6
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:34,366
We used to have fun.

7
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:39,206
We used to roam the streets.

8
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:42,916
There was people suffering
ofpain and hunger.

9
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:46,636
Some people, their tongues
were hanging out of their mouth.

10
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,366
Just got to get fixed up first.

11
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:01,286
Things aren't always
gonna be this way.

12
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:04,557
You know that, don't you?

13
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:10,438
He used tojuggle apples.

14
00:04:10,607 --> 00:04:14,805
He used to amuse us.
He used to entertain us.

15
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:19,081
What else do I got to do today?

16
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:22,922
In fact, all three of us
been going places,

17
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:25,476
Iooking and searching for things...

18
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,327
..going on adventures.

19
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:42,437
They told everybody
they were brother and sister.

20
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:46,156
My brother didn't want
nobody to know.

21
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:51,845
You know how people are. You tell
them something, they start talking.

22
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:20,516
I met this guy named Ding Dong.

23
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,918
He told me the whole earth
is going up in flames.

24
00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:28,638
Flames will come out ofhere
and there, and they'lljust rise up.

25
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:31,401
The mountains are gonna
go up in big flames.

26
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:35,242
The water is gonna rise in flames.

27
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:38,676
Creatures will run every which way,

28
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:42,317
some of them burnt,
half their wings burning.

29
00:05:42,487 --> 00:05:46,765
People are gonna be screaming
and hollering for help.

30
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:52,598
The people that have been good will
go to heaven and escape the fire.

31
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,076
Sackers! I need sackers!

32
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:59,684
But ifyou've been bad,
God don't even hear you talking.

33
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,360
A man can earn three dollars a day
if he wants to work.

34
00:06:04,527 --> 00:06:07,405
Sackers! I need sackers!

35
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:11,196
- You ever sacked before? When?
- Last year.

36
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:18,003
- Whose place is that?
- The owner's.

37
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:20,078
Don't any of you go up there!

38
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:22,203
Silver tongue.

39
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:25,206
You all right?

40
00:07:57,647 --> 00:08:02,118
- You live around here?
- No. No, I don't.

41
00:08:03,887 --> 00:08:06,640
- Where do you live?
- In Chicago.

42
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:08,479
Oh, yeah?

43
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:13,082
- What's that in your hair?
- In my hair?

44
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:16,080
In my ear?
That's what you call a makins.

45
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:19,045
- What's a makins?
- A cigarette.

46
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:24,725
It's tobacco in a bag, and you put it
and roll it up. But I'm gonna save it.

47
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:27,321
- You like it out here?
- Yeah.

48
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:30,445
- It's nice.
- I love it here. I like the wheat fields.

49
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:33,838
You have any brothers and sisters?

50
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:36,202
- No.
- I have a brother.

51
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:39,916
- What's his name?
- Bill.

52
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:44,842
- Where?
- Somewhere over there. I don't know.

53
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:50,037
I got one.

54
00:08:50,207 --> 00:08:52,038
Let me see.

55
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:57,204
Don't lose him.
There he goes. Look, look.

56
00:08:57,367 --> 00:09:00,404
Oh, you lost him.
I don't think they like us.

57
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:10,282
Abby's it!

58
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:12,597
Abby's too slow.

59
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:19,642
You didn't get me.

60
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:54,515
For a thousand years on Thy side are
but as yesterday, when it is passed,

61
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,996
and as a watch in the night.

62
00:09:57,167 --> 00:10:00,364
As soon as Thou scatters them...

63
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:25,120
Amen.

64
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:42,605
Ho!

65
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:51,247
Come on!

66
00:11:05,487 --> 00:11:08,684
- Get in closer!
- Line 'em up!

67
00:11:40,487 --> 00:11:43,559
The farmer didn't know
when he first saw her

68
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:48,278
or what it was about her
that caught his eye.

69
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:52,235
Maybe it was the way
the wind blew through her hair.

70
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:56,435
Why do you wear a black hat?

71
00:11:56,607 --> 00:11:58,677
Let me see your hands.

72
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:06,519
Get some spoons
and I'll meet you over there.

73
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:09,201
I'll be in the field here.

74
00:12:15,607 --> 00:12:18,679
Does your sister
keep you warm at night?

75
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:22,442
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

76
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:46,321
- Let me go!
- OK!

77
00:13:04,887 --> 00:13:08,766
Too bad you ain't got no real food left.
I'm kind of hungry.

78
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:16,122
I got a little potato.

79
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:58,076
You know anything about that woman
out there, the one with the black hair?

80
00:14:00,687 --> 00:14:03,759
You haven't heard anything about her,
where she's from?

81
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,445
You want me to find out?

82
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:50,117
You've wasted more than 1 2 bushel in
this row. I'm docking you three dollars.

83
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:54,678
- What? That's not fair.
- Then leave. You're fired.

84
00:14:57,127 --> 00:14:59,561
- Forget it. Don't fight about it.
- You wanna stay?

85
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:03,964
Then shut up and get back to work.

86
00:15:14,207 --> 00:15:16,880
They treat you like jack shit out here.

87
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:21,161
I wouldn't worry about it.

88
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:28,956
If I see a doctor, I'll see if I can
get him to give you something for that.

89
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:32,566
OK.

90
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:09,723
I appreciate you coming out, doc.

91
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,684
That's all right.

92
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:16,676
I'll be checking on you
as time goes on.

93
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:21,038
You never think
it's gonna happen to you.

94
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:24,965
How long would you reckon I have?

95
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:28,516
You know, you can tell me.

96
00:16:32,087 --> 00:16:36,285
A year. Maybe a year.

97
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:44,480
He knew he was gonna die.

98
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:48,037
He knew that there was nothing
that could be done.

99
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,803
Go slow.

100
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:57,805
You only live on this earth once.

101
00:16:57,967 --> 00:17:02,245
In my opinion, as long as you're
around, you should have it nice.

102
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,919
Excuse me. I forgot where I was.

103
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:33,679
Don't worry.

104
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:39,276
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.

105
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:44,962
Wait a minute.

106
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:50,440
- Where do you go from here?
- All over.

107
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:53,917
Wyoming.

108
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,001
Do you think I like it?

109
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:03,363
- I saved your life today.
- No.

110
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:06,917
- Yeah, I killed this shit.
- Thanks.

111
00:18:08,247 --> 00:18:11,159
I'm always looking out for you.

112
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,602
You deserve a medal.

113
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:24,877
Are you cold?

114
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:29,438
It's only for a while.
Then we'll go to New York.

115
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:34,362
- And then what?
- Then we're there and get fixed up.

116
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:18,682
I wanna see everybody working!
Everybody moving it along!

117
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:21,680
Shake 'em! Come on, let's go!

118
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:40,839
From the time the sun went up
till it went down,

119
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:44,363
they were working all the time.

120
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:48,440
Non-stop. Just keep going.

121
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:56,361
You didn't work,
they'd ship you right out of there.

122
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:04,006
They don't need you. They can
always get somebody else.

123
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:50,201
That's at a profit
of 4.75 dollars an acre.

124
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:54,599
Multiply that with 20,000,
you're talking over six figures.

125
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:57,042
- Big year.
- Your biggest ever.

126
00:20:57,207 --> 00:21:00,438
Should make you
the richest man in the Panhandle.

127
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:07,526
Get out while you're this far ahead.
You have nothing to gain by staying.

128
00:21:33,647 --> 00:21:37,356
- Get down from there!
- No!

129
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:43,321
Hold it, I got to clean up!

130
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:05,156
This farmer, he had a big spread
and a lot ofmoney.

131
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:08,160
Whoever was sitting in the chair
when he'd come around,

132
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,842
why, they'd stand up
and give it to him.

133
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:15,835
Wasn't no harm in him.

134
00:22:16,007 --> 00:22:19,716
You'd give him a flower,
he'd keep it forever.

135
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:26,518
He was headed for the bone-yard
any minute,

136
00:22:26,687 --> 00:22:33,718
but he wasn't really squawking
about it, like some people.

137
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:36,720
In one way I felt sorry for him,

138
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:40,516
'cause he had nobody
to stand out for him,

139
00:22:40,687 --> 00:22:46,796
be by his side, hold his hand when
he needs attention or something.

140
00:22:46,967 --> 00:22:49,242
That's touching.

141
00:22:50,647 --> 00:22:53,366
We' Il probably be all done
by tomorrow.

142
00:23:03,887 --> 00:23:07,277
You still planning on going north?

143
00:23:10,327 --> 00:23:12,921
The reason I ask is...

144
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:17,720
..maybe you'd like to stay on here.

145
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:23,443
It'd be easier than now. There's not
that much work after the harvest.

146
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:26,802
The pay is just as good.

147
00:23:31,087 --> 00:23:35,717
It's an idea. You could think about it
and let me know later.

148
00:23:46,327 --> 00:23:48,887
I got to run.

149
00:23:49,047 --> 00:23:51,163
Who's that?

150
00:23:51,327 --> 00:23:53,443
My brother.

151
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:01,361
He's stuck on you.

152
00:24:06,927 --> 00:24:11,523
- There are people around.
- There's nobody around.

153
00:24:11,687 --> 00:24:13,882
Stop it.

154
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,960
He doesn't have any family either.

155
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,720
Why don't you tell him you'll stay?

156
00:24:39,407 --> 00:24:41,477
What for?

157
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,319
I don't know.

158
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:47,286
Something might happen.

159
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,999
What's your mouth hanging open for?

160
00:24:57,687 --> 00:25:00,440
Don't tell me. I already know.

161
00:25:00,607 --> 00:25:04,122
On account of your unhappy life
and all that shit.

162
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:09,076
I'm telling you
we got to do something about it.

163
00:25:09,247 --> 00:25:11,761
Can't expect anybody else to.

164
00:25:45,687 --> 00:25:47,086
Last load!

165
00:25:50,767 --> 00:25:52,678
Hup! Shut her down!

166
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:24,487
Are we gonna stay?

167
00:26:25,527 --> 00:26:27,563
If she wants to.

168
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:35,117
You'd rather go?

169
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:39,886
I'd rather be the king of Siam.

170
00:26:41,087 --> 00:26:43,760
Did you put aspirin in this?

171
00:26:43,927 --> 00:26:46,077
20 dollars.

172
00:26:51,407 --> 00:26:54,126
- Want a bite?
- Thank you very much, sir.

173
00:26:56,407 --> 00:27:01,162
- Did he ever buy you anything?
- Lots of things.

174
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:03,795
He'll come back, I'm sure.

175
00:27:05,647 --> 00:27:08,002
I don't think so.

176
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:09,964
Why not?

177
00:27:10,127 --> 00:27:14,279
'Cause if he wanted me to be with him,
he would've took me.

178
00:27:14,447 --> 00:27:17,166
Oh, that's not true.

179
00:27:17,327 --> 00:27:22,447
Maybe I wasn't pretty enough
or something stupid like that.

180
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:26,120
What happened to your ear?

181
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:32,203
A dog bit me when I was little.
We were playing.

182
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:34,403
Can I have a puff?

183
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:45,206
He was tired ofliving like the rest,
nosing around like a pig in a gutter.

184
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:48,040
He wasn't in the mood no more.

185
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:53,479
He figured there was something wrong,
the way they always got no luck,

186
00:27:53,647 --> 00:27:56,798
and they ought to get it
straightened out.

187
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,527
He figured some people
need more than they got,

188
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:02,155
other people got more
than they need.

189
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:05,603
Just a matter
ofgetting us all together.

190
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,999
Chicago! Well, go ahead!

191
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:52,239
You never used to be like this.

192
00:28:55,487 --> 00:29:00,766
People have always been giving
me a hard time. Don't you start it, too.

193
00:29:02,527 --> 00:29:05,121
Big federal case.

194
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:10,800
You don't have to decide
anything final now.

195
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:13,800
Just if we're gonna stay.

196
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:07,278
Yeah, I could stay. Sure. I got to keep
my brother and sister with me.

197
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:50,279
I'll try and come back,
'cause I like staying with you.

198
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:54,281
You're so much fun. I love you.
I want you to be really good.

199
00:30:54,447 --> 00:30:58,804
Don't do anything wrong.
If you do, I'll get you.

200
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:02,004
I love you. Don't do nothing wrong!

201
00:31:50,607 --> 00:31:53,758
I've been thinking
what to do with my future.

202
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:07,083
I could be a mud doctor,
checking out the earth underneath.

203
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:32,005
Why are you doing this?

204
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:40,123
When I was your age,
I was all by myself in the world.

205
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:47,278
I used to sit and wrap cigars
till after dark.

206
00:32:48,647 --> 00:32:53,516
My skin was as white as paper.
I never saw the daylight.

207
00:32:57,527 --> 00:33:00,200
This is not so bad.

208
00:33:03,847 --> 00:33:06,077
Don't make me laugh.

209
00:33:10,607 --> 00:33:12,643
Wait a minute.

210
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:15,480
- Where are you people from?
- Chicago.

211
00:33:15,647 --> 00:33:18,719
- What did you do there?
- Nothing.

212
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:23,039
- Your brother, I mean.
- He worked in a factory.

213
00:33:25,927 --> 00:33:29,442
I can remember
the first time I ever saw you.

214
00:33:32,207 --> 00:33:35,836
I'd never seen
hair as black as yours,

215
00:33:36,007 --> 00:33:38,396
skin so pretty.

216
00:33:41,927 --> 00:33:44,680
Scared I'd never see you again.

217
00:33:52,127 --> 00:33:54,243
Run!

218
00:33:56,127 --> 00:33:57,606
Safe!

219
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:14,038
So I went to work in a mill.
Couldn't wait to get in there.

220
00:34:14,207 --> 00:34:17,836
Began at seven and
had to have a smile on your face.

221
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:23,076
And one day you wake up...

222
00:34:24,407 --> 00:34:27,479
..you find you're not
the smartest guy in the world.

223
00:34:27,647 --> 00:34:31,117
Never gonna come up
with a big score.

224
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:36,199
When I was growing up,
I thought I really would.

225
00:34:50,727 --> 00:34:54,037
- Where did you learn that?
- Watched the girls at Baker Hall.

226
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:58,565
Actually, I could have been a dancer.

227
00:35:04,647 --> 00:35:07,320
I think I love you.

228
00:35:10,167 --> 00:35:13,159
What a nice thing to say.

229
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,759
Never thought he'd have the guts.

230
00:35:31,727 --> 00:35:34,719
- Who'd know but you and me?
- Nobody.

231
00:35:34,887 --> 00:35:37,526
It's all that matters, isn't it?

232
00:35:39,447 --> 00:35:42,484
You talk like it was all right.

233
00:35:42,647 --> 00:35:45,957
There'd never be the chance
to enjoy his money anyway.

234
00:35:54,007 --> 00:35:56,760
What makes you think
it's only a couple of months?

235
00:35:56,927 --> 00:36:01,364
The man has got one foot on a banana
peel, the other on a roller-skate.

236
00:36:03,207 --> 00:36:08,440
We'll all be gone in a couple of years.
Who's gonna care we acted perfect?

237
00:36:11,727 --> 00:36:14,321
I held out a long time.

238
00:36:15,327 --> 00:36:18,399
I had rich men pay me compliments.

239
00:36:20,087 --> 00:36:23,682
- Have I ever said anything...
- You don't have to.

240
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:27,237
I hate it,
to see you stooped over out there.

241
00:36:27,407 --> 00:36:30,205
Them looking at your ass
like you were a whore.

242
00:36:35,967 --> 00:36:37,958
I hate it.

243
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:11,557
As you will answer
at the dreadful day of judgement...

244
00:37:11,727 --> 00:37:13,399
..that if either of you
know any impediment...

245
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:16,001
For richer and for poorer,

246
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:20,285
for better and for worse,
in sickness and in health,

247
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:24,520
to love and to cherish
till death us do part.

248
00:37:24,687 --> 00:37:29,920
Bless this ring that he who gives it
and she who wears it may abide it...

249
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:47,124
Thank you.

250
00:38:19,247 --> 00:38:21,966
You're like an angel.

251
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,997
I wish I was.

252
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:30,684
Does all this seem strange to you?

253
00:38:41,647 --> 00:38:46,038
Why don't you move your things
in the house while we're gone?

254
00:38:46,207 --> 00:38:47,686
All right.

255
00:38:52,727 --> 00:38:54,399
Bye.

256
00:40:07,207 --> 00:40:09,357
Did you see there?

257
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:13,523
There's more right up there, too.

258
00:40:21,567 --> 00:40:25,480
You've never been in love before.
Why is that?

259
00:40:44,327 --> 00:40:47,239
We've never been this rich, all right?

260
00:40:47,407 --> 00:40:52,435
I mean, we werejust all of a sudden
living like kings.

261
00:40:52,607 --> 00:40:57,601
Just nothing to do all day
but crackjokes and lay around.

262
00:40:57,767 --> 00:41:00,042
We didn't have to work.

263
00:41:01,247 --> 00:41:04,956
I'm telling you,
the rich got it figured out.

264
00:41:06,927 --> 00:41:10,317
- It's soft and tickles.
- Let me try.

265
00:41:47,887 --> 00:41:51,004
- Oh, Linda!
- Please go away.

266
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:53,078
- Can you do anything?
- No.

267
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:57,399
- That's not so. Show them that.
- What? The potatoes?

268
00:42:03,047 --> 00:42:06,198
- Hey, that's mine.
- Now it's for the dogs.

269
00:42:13,487 --> 00:42:16,206
I got to like this farm.

270
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:20,997
Do anything I want.
Roll in the fields.

271
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:24,443
Talk to the wheat patches.

272
00:42:24,607 --> 00:42:27,405
When I was sleeping,
they'd talk to me.

273
00:42:28,727 --> 00:42:31,241
They'd go in my dreams.

274
00:43:04,007 --> 00:43:07,682
- What's the matter with you?
- I get lonely by myself.

275
00:43:19,047 --> 00:43:23,165
- See this bottle? I wanna break it.
- You're crazy.

276
00:43:32,127 --> 00:43:34,322
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

277
00:43:44,727 --> 00:43:47,764
It scares me doing this, you know?

278
00:43:51,567 --> 00:43:55,606
- I dropped my glass.
- Doesn't matter.

279
00:44:06,247 --> 00:44:09,603
I never wanted to fall in love with you.

280
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:12,156
Nobody asked you to.

281
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:18,238
A minute ago, you said
I was irresistible. I still am.

282
00:44:20,007 --> 00:44:22,646
Your hair is still the same.

283
00:44:45,487 --> 00:44:46,840
Abby!

284
00:44:52,247 --> 00:44:53,885
Abby!

285
00:45:08,607 --> 00:45:11,041
Where have you been?

286
00:45:11,207 --> 00:45:14,597
I couldn't sleep well.
I went out for a walk.

287
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:18,043
- You should've woke me up.
- I didn't want to.

288
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:45,446
Nobody sent us letters.

289
00:45:47,087 --> 00:45:49,885
We didn't receive no cards.

290
00:46:08,487 --> 00:46:13,242
Sometimes I feel very old,
like my whole life is over.

291
00:46:14,247 --> 00:46:16,636
Like I'm not around no more.

292
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:21,403
- I bet he likes looking at you in that.
- This?

293
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:23,762
I thought you liked it.

294
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:29,002
You don't like them, do you?
Never have.

295
00:46:29,927 --> 00:46:32,725
I don't think they're honest people.

296
00:46:32,887 --> 00:46:37,278
As a matter of fact,
I think they're a pair of con artists.

297
00:46:41,527 --> 00:46:45,998
Maybe you'd be better off
taking over the north end till spring.

298
00:46:46,967 --> 00:46:51,324
I mean, we've been together a long
time, and I've always felt close to you.

299
00:46:52,687 --> 00:46:57,602
It might work out better, that's all.
Less friction.

300
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:02,877
You're talking about my wife.

301
00:47:06,127 --> 00:47:09,039
Maybe I better pack.

302
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:25,000
I know what you're doing.

303
00:47:31,367 --> 00:47:33,642
That boy is like a son to me.

304
00:48:00,727 --> 00:48:03,764
You know what I thought
when I first saw you?

305
00:48:03,927 --> 00:48:08,796
"If I could touch her,
everything would be all right."

306
00:48:08,967 --> 00:48:12,846
You make me feel like I've come
back to life. Isn't that funny?

307
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:20,721
I always thought being alone was
something a man had to put up with.

308
00:48:20,887 --> 00:48:23,355
You just got used to it.

309
00:48:25,847 --> 00:48:29,920
Sometimes it's like
you're right inside of me,

310
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:35,115
Iike I can hear your voice
and feel your breath and everything.

311
00:48:45,247 --> 00:48:47,841
Why are you so uneasy with me?

312
00:48:48,847 --> 00:48:51,077
I'm sorry.

313
00:48:51,247 --> 00:48:54,683
I don't blame you.
Do I make it sound like that?

314
00:49:00,007 --> 00:49:02,362
You have a right to.

315
00:49:04,447 --> 00:49:08,156
It's just that it seems
like I don't know you.

316
00:49:46,007 --> 00:49:50,239
Did you see him wave? There he is!

317
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:01,564
Will you help me up?

318
00:50:01,727 --> 00:50:05,720
Instead ofgetting sicker,
hejust stayed the same.

319
00:50:06,767 --> 00:50:10,237
He didn't get sicker.
He didn't get better.

320
00:50:12,487 --> 00:50:18,676
They were kind-hearted and thought
he was going out on his own steam.

321
00:50:26,527 --> 00:50:31,043
The doc must've come over,
or someone gave him something.

322
00:50:31,207 --> 00:50:35,166
Probably some kind ofmedicine
or something.

323
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:38,797
I could havejust took it
and put it in a ditch.

324
00:50:41,007 --> 00:50:46,035
Like they do to a horse.
They shoot him right away.

325
00:51:07,607 --> 00:51:09,404
Buster, fetch!

326
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:13,037
Whoa. Easy.

327
00:51:15,207 --> 00:51:17,198
Whoa, pup.

328
00:51:18,247 --> 00:51:19,885
Sally.

329
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:25,637
Whoa, pup. Sally. Sally.

330
00:51:29,967 --> 00:51:31,719
Whoa, pup.

331
00:51:33,887 --> 00:51:36,355
Whoa, whoa.

332
00:51:57,687 --> 00:52:00,042
You seem jumpy today.

333
00:52:02,967 --> 00:52:04,798
I'm sick of these stinking birds.

334
00:52:04,967 --> 00:52:08,482
- What's the matter?
- You don't wanna know about it.

335
00:52:58,407 --> 00:53:03,242
Just as things were about to blow,
this flying circus came in.

336
00:53:04,607 --> 00:53:09,681
After six months on this patch,
I needed a breath offresh air.

337
00:53:19,607 --> 00:53:22,644
They were screaming and yelling
and bopping each other.

338
00:53:22,807 --> 00:53:27,722
The big one pushed the little one
and said, "I started. You start. "

339
00:53:27,887 --> 00:53:30,765
The little one started in.

340
00:53:30,927 --> 00:53:34,602
If they couldn't think of a good one
to come back with, they'd stop.

341
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:52,085
The little one said, "I didn't do this. "
The big one said, " Yes, you did. "

342
00:53:52,247 --> 00:53:54,841
They couldn't sort it out.

343
00:53:55,007 --> 00:53:57,475
I wanna give them a hand for this.

344
00:54:13,607 --> 00:54:16,758
The deviljust sitting there laughing.

345
00:54:16,927 --> 00:54:19,805
He's glad when people does bad.

346
00:54:19,967 --> 00:54:22,083
Then he sends them
to the snake house.

347
00:54:22,247 --> 00:54:24,124
He sits there laughing

348
00:54:24,287 --> 00:54:28,439
while you're tied up and snakes
are eating your eyes out.

349
00:54:29,447 --> 00:54:33,520
They go down your throat
and eat all your systems up.

350
00:54:37,967 --> 00:54:41,926
You're confusing me, you know.
You're driving me crazy.

351
00:54:42,087 --> 00:54:45,284
I don't know if I'm coming or going.

352
00:54:45,447 --> 00:54:47,165
You never did.

353
00:55:06,287 --> 00:55:08,517
I think the devil was on the farm.

354
00:55:25,487 --> 00:55:29,116
- What's going on?
- What's the matter?

355
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,602
You know what I mean.

356
00:55:36,487 --> 00:55:40,196
Why do you let him
touch you like that?

357
00:55:46,567 --> 00:55:48,922
What are you talking about?

358
00:55:49,087 --> 00:55:52,079
How do brothers and sisters act
where you come from?

359
00:55:52,247 --> 00:55:54,681
Did you ever have a sister?

360
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,480
Well, then, who are you to judge?

361
00:56:05,447 --> 00:56:07,836
Did you say anything to him?

362
00:56:10,087 --> 00:56:12,920
I've never seen him
act like this before.

363
00:56:13,087 --> 00:56:15,965
- He must think we're awful.
- What do you care?

364
00:56:25,287 --> 00:56:27,323
You're in love with him.

365
00:56:36,527 --> 00:56:39,280
- Are you leaving?
- Yeah.

366
00:56:39,447 --> 00:56:41,039
What for?

367
00:56:41,207 --> 00:56:45,120
I've got business to take care of.
They're giving me a lift.

368
00:56:46,127 --> 00:56:50,166
- Just like that, huh?
- Guess so.

369
00:57:11,527 --> 00:57:14,325
He'd seen how it all was.

370
00:57:17,047 --> 00:57:19,641
She loves the farmer.

371
00:58:02,247 --> 00:58:06,957
He taught me keys on the pianos
and notes.

372
00:58:09,367 --> 00:58:13,246
He taught me
about the parts of our globe.

373
01:01:11,487 --> 01:01:14,638
Hey! I missed you so much.

374
01:01:14,807 --> 01:01:17,275
- Did you miss me?
- Yeah, a lot.

375
01:01:17,447 --> 01:01:21,486
Hey, you look just the same.
We've been reading about you.

376
01:01:21,647 --> 01:01:25,083
- What do you mean?
- Oh, about Chicago.

377
01:01:25,247 --> 01:01:28,205
Did you come all the way
by motorcycle?

378
01:02:28,727 --> 01:02:30,206
I'm sorry.

379
01:02:38,527 --> 01:02:40,995
You didn't do nothing to me.

380
01:02:42,527 --> 01:02:45,485
I didn't know what I had with you.

381
01:02:49,167 --> 01:02:51,761
I think about it.

382
01:02:52,447 --> 01:02:55,723
The things I said to you.

383
01:02:55,887 --> 01:02:58,765
How I pushed you into this.

384
01:03:07,567 --> 01:03:10,525
I got nobody to blame but myself.

385
01:03:15,287 --> 01:03:19,724
Well, I got to get going.
Before it gets too late.

386
01:06:13,087 --> 01:06:14,964
Smoke them out! Swat them out!

387
01:06:19,367 --> 01:06:21,403
That way! Let's go. Come on!

388
01:08:41,607 --> 01:08:45,202
What's this? What are you doing?

389
01:08:45,367 --> 01:08:49,280
- What do you care?
- What are you doing?

390
01:08:50,807 --> 01:08:53,162
Are you crazy?!

391
01:09:09,807 --> 01:09:11,479
Let it burn!

392
01:09:19,087 --> 01:09:21,647
Get tractors, blankets!

393
01:10:04,087 --> 01:10:06,396
What are we gonna do?

394
01:10:10,407 --> 01:10:12,602
We gotta get out of here.

395
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:16,322
He knows.

396
01:12:25,487 --> 01:12:28,479
What did you want from me?

397
01:12:45,407 --> 01:12:47,045
Wait.

398
01:12:51,127 --> 01:12:52,526
You're a liar!

399
01:14:18,927 --> 01:14:21,043
Shall I pull it out?

400
01:15:12,327 --> 01:15:17,481
I'll tell you the whole story later.
We can't do anything about it now.

401
01:15:31,567 --> 01:15:36,800
You know, you're skinning me alive,
but I'll give you the old van for the boat.

402
01:15:48,087 --> 01:15:54,083
Nobody's perfect. There was never
a perfect person around.

403
01:15:54,247 --> 01:15:59,082
Youjust got half devil
and half angel in you.

404
01:16:14,047 --> 01:16:17,562
She promised herself
she'd lead a good life from now on.

405
01:16:17,727 --> 01:16:19,683
She blamed it all on herself.

406
01:16:26,447 --> 01:16:29,598
It's good. I like it.

407
01:16:29,767 --> 01:16:31,883
She didn't care
ifshe was happy or not.

408
01:16:32,047 --> 01:16:36,802
Shejust wanted to make up
for what she did wrong.

409
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:38,798
I have a three-pound cop.

410
01:16:38,967 --> 01:16:43,677
The sun looks ghostly when there's
a mist on the river and it's quiet.

411
01:16:43,847 --> 01:16:46,315
I never known it before.

412
01:16:50,167 --> 01:16:55,366
You could see people on the shore,
but not what they were doing.

413
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:59,236
They were probably
calling for help or something,

414
01:16:59,407 --> 01:17:04,401
or they were trying to bury
somebody or something.

415
01:17:07,607 --> 01:17:10,804
We seen trees
with leaves shaking.

416
01:17:10,967 --> 01:17:16,041
It looks like shadows ofguys
coming at you and stuff.

417
01:17:17,487 --> 01:17:22,481
We heard owls squawking away,
"ooming" away.

418
01:17:22,647 --> 01:17:26,322
We didn't know where we were
going or what we were gonna do.

419
01:17:26,487 --> 01:17:31,277
I've never been on a boat before.
That was the first time.

420
01:17:33,087 --> 01:17:37,080
Have you seen her? Where?

421
01:17:37,247 --> 01:17:43,163
Some sights I saw were so spooky
they gave me goose-pimples.

422
01:17:43,327 --> 01:17:47,400
I felt like cold hands touching
the back ofmy neck,

423
01:17:47,567 --> 01:17:52,516
and it could be the dead
coming for me or something.

424
01:17:54,287 --> 01:17:58,439
I remember this guy.
His name was Black Jack. He died.

425
01:17:58,607 --> 01:18:01,360
He only had one leg, and he died.

426
01:18:01,527 --> 01:18:06,157
And I think that was Black Jack,
making those noises.

427
01:19:14,927 --> 01:19:16,519
He's there!

428
01:19:40,087 --> 01:19:42,317
Check out those trees!

429
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:51,885
Keep down!

430
01:19:56,087 --> 01:19:58,237
- Just stay here.
- Wait a minute.

431
01:20:11,047 --> 01:20:14,881
- Go around back that way.
- Don't let him get back to the river.

432
01:21:05,487 --> 01:21:08,081
I'm gonna go this way.
You go over there.

433
01:21:20,327 --> 01:21:22,158
Hey, Linder!

434
01:23:00,927 --> 01:23:03,487
You want that, too, don't you?

435
01:23:04,487 --> 01:23:07,081
You'll make lots of friends.

436
01:23:29,207 --> 01:23:31,801
You'll be all right.

437
01:23:33,287 --> 01:23:35,926
Turn around and go inside.

438
01:24:03,727 --> 01:24:06,195
Oranges, oranges.

439
01:25:13,767 --> 01:25:15,519
Come on.

440
01:25:17,087 --> 01:25:21,717
Don't worry about that stuff. I got
a new boyfriend. He's in the army.

441
01:25:21,887 --> 01:25:26,642
Maybe the other got killed. Anyway,
he said I'm pretty. Maybe I am.

442
01:25:26,807 --> 01:25:28,798
Look at this.

443
01:25:29,807 --> 01:25:32,799
Hey, what did you do
at that school anyway?

444
01:25:51,927 --> 01:25:54,441
Into the alley. Hurry up.

445
01:25:57,527 --> 01:26:00,678
I don't wait two hours for nobody.

446
01:26:01,687 --> 01:26:04,679
Maybe he don't have a watch.

447
01:26:04,847 --> 01:26:08,362
Yeah, if I believe that,
he'll tell me another.

448
01:26:09,367 --> 01:26:11,801
His name was Edward.

449
01:26:13,207 --> 01:26:17,086
He was nice.
I liked him. I don't know.

450
01:26:17,247 --> 01:26:21,559
He said he was gonna buy me a fur.
I always wanted a fur.

451
01:26:21,727 --> 01:26:25,037
- Where are you going?
- For a walk.

452
01:26:26,047 --> 01:26:28,481
I don't know where, but...

453
01:26:29,807 --> 01:26:34,323
Go beat the heck out of some tree.
Take it out on them.

454
01:26:34,487 --> 01:26:36,443
You coming with me, or what?

455
01:26:36,607 --> 01:26:41,044
This girl didn't know where she was
going or what she was gonna do.

456
01:26:41,207 --> 01:26:44,119
She didn't have no money on her.

457
01:26:45,327 --> 01:26:48,444
Maybe she'd meet up
with a character.

458
01:26:49,807 --> 01:26:54,039
I was hoping things would work out
for her. She was a good friend.
