1
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,650
Deanie, please.

2
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,960
Bud, I'm afraid.

3
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,960
Oh, Bud.

4
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,330
Don't, Bud.

5
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,130
No.

6
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,170
We mustn't, Bud.

7
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,900
No. No.

8
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,480
Bud, don't be mad.

9
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,890
I'd better take you home.

10
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,960
We've had enough kissing for tonight.

11
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,390
Has Bud left?

12
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,950
Yes, Mom.

13
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,800
There's wonderful news tonight.

14
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,660
The Stamper Oil stocks, drink your milk,
went up 14 points today.

15
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,040
Think of it, honey.

16
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:29,010
That means if we sold those stocks,
we'd make $15,000.

17
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,010
Maybe we can even send you away
to college next year.

18
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,610
Well, we're not going to sell.

19
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,320
Your father says that everyone
at the Elks says...

20
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,880
...that the stocks are going up even higher.

21
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,830
Didn't Bud say anything about it tonight?

22
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,800
He doesn't know anything
about his father's business, Mom.

23
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,470
He doesn't care about that.

24
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,110
What were you and Bud doing all this time,
for heaven's sake?

25
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,600
We were studying together.

26
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,820
I'm going to bed, Mom. I'm awfully tired.

27
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,560
Now, Wilma Dean....

28
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,070
I want to talk to you.

29
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,710
Now, Wilma Dean, Bud Stamper could
get you into a whole lot of trouble.

30
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,870
And you know how I mean.

31
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,410
Boys don't respect a girl
they can go all the way with.

32
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,650
Boys want a nice girl for a wife.

33
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,790
Wilma Dean, you and Bud haven't gone
too far already, have you?

34
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,330
No, Mother.

35
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,800
Tell me the truth, Wilma Dean!

36
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,970
No, Mom, we haven't gone too far.

37
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,370
That's a relief.

38
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,710
Mom?

39
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,510
Is it so terrible to have those feelings
about a boy?

40
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,280
No nice girl does.

41
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,450
Doesn't she?

42
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,790
No. No nice girl.

43
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,730
But, Mom...

44
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,330
...didn't you ever....

45
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,910
Didn't you ever feel that way about Dad?

46
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,210
Your father never laid a hand on me
until we were married.

47
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,480
And then...

48
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,010
...I just gave in because a wife has to.

49
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,590
A woman doesn't enjoy those things
the way a man does.

50
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,260
She just lets her husband...

51
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,870
...come near her in order to have children.

52
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,180
Deanie, what's troubling you?

53
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,250
Oh, nothing, Mom.

54
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,690
I'm just tired.

55
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,080
I want to go to bed now.

56
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,580
Now, Deanie...

57
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,730
...you tell Bud Stamper to bring you home
earlier after this...

58
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,170
...especially on school nights.

59
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,740
"Good night, sleep tight,
don't let the bedbugs bite."

60
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,870
'Night.

61
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,670
"Our Father which art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name...."

62
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,250
Something wrong?

63
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,300
Wilma Dean and the Stamper boy
are in love.

64
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,860
They're in love, I tell you, Del!

65
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,870
Go back to sleep, Mama.

66
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,500
He'd be the catch of a lifetime, Del.

67
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,420
I hope we bring in a gusher
every day, Boss!

68
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,900
Hold it! Hold it!

69
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,060
Boss, Bud's here. Here's Bud!

70
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,190
Come on in here, my boy.

71
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,170
Your old man will get us in trouble
with our wives...

72
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,870
...'cause we'll go home smelling
like home brew and they'll wonder why.

73
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,960
They'll want some, too.

74
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,840
-Get something to eat, Son.
-I gotta go up to bed now.

75
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,210
Wait a minute, Son. I want to talk to you.

76
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,810
You go on entertaining yourselves.
I'll have a few words with my boy here.

77
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,890
Have more of this venison.
You don't get meat like that anymore.

78
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,480
They don't make home brew
like that anymore.

79
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,290
It's pretty late for a boy
keeping football training, isn't it?

80
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,730
Come here. I want to talk to you, Son.

81
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,840
You're the captain of the team, Son.
Those other boys look up to you.

82
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,400
You gotta run with the ball.

83
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,880
I wasn't much older than you, Bud,
when I fell off that crown block...

84
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,270
...and I hit that rig floor.

85
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,570
And my running days was long gone.

86
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,620
So, you're doing the running
for both of us now, boy.

87
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,190
Listen, I brought in a well today.

88
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,960
She's flowing over 100 barrels an hour,
and our stocks are going way up.

89
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,160
Those big Eastern companies are beginning
to take notice of us.

90
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,830
Them people really beginning
to take notice of us.

91
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,270
-That's great.
-You been out with the Loomis girl?

92
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,170
-Yes, sir.
-Are you watching yourself with her?

93
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,540
You're not doing anything
you'll be ashamed of, are you?

94
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,670
No, sir.

95
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,120
She's a nice kid, Son. She's a good looker.

96
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,280
I've known her folks ever since
old Del and I were boys together.

97
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,880
I got nothing against them
'cause they're poor.

98
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,890
I'm not a snob or anything like that.

99
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,330
The only difference between me and Del
is that I got ambition.

100
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,760
Hey, Dad, l--

101
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,360
But if anything was to happen,
you'd have to marry her.

102
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,810
You'd have to marry her, Son.
You realize that, don't you?

103
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,070
You get a girl in trouble
and you gotta take the consequences.

104
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,580
-Dad, I'm not--
-Sit down.

105
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,580
-I want to talk to you--
-Sit down.

106
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,910
-I want to talk to you about that.
-All right.

107
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,210
All right, lay it on me. Come on.

108
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,620
Lay it on me. That a boy.
There we go, lay it on me.

109
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,520
Lay it on now. Lick like a bear.

110
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,390
We got a future, boy.
You and me, we got a future.

111
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,830
First, we'll get you an education.

112
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,700
The best. Four years at Yale.

113
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,170
Did I tell you a secret?

114
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,830
-I'll tell you a secret.
-What?

115
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,960
Come here.

116
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,010
My company is gonna merge
with one of those big Eastern companies.

117
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,010
I'm gonna put you in there, boy.

118
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,580
I'm lining up a future for you, boy.

119
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,050
I've been thinking about--

120
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,880
There ain't nothing in this world
that I wouldn't do for you, boy.

121
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,710
I know.

122
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,310
There's nothing I wouldn't do
if you do right.

123
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,050
If you do right, Bud!

124
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,120
Now, don't disappoint me, Son.

125
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,730
Don't disappoint me, boy.

126
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,630
God knows I've had
one disappointment already.

127
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,900
-She asleep?
-Yes, finally.

128
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,570
-Is Sis back?
-Hello, Bud, darling.

129
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,370
Mother brought her home
from Chicago a little while ago.

130
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,540
Welcome home, Mom.

131
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,770
It was a miserable trip, just miserable.
How's Deanie?

132
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,440
I don't know.

133
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,250
I'm gonna go to bed, Dad.

134
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,290
I'm going to bed, too,
but I'm afraid I won't sleep a wink.

135
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,120
Yeah, you go to bed, Son.

136
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,790
You got a football game to win tomorrow.

137
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,190
I got all my hopes pinned on you now.

138
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,310
How're you men getting on in there?

139
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,710
Well, you certainly spoiled that girl.

140
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,520
First you send her off to finishing school.

141
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,220
She breaks all the rules
and they kick her out.

142
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,190
Then you send her off to university.

143
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,490
She goes hog wild
and flunks all her courses.

144
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,930
Then you had to learn your lesson
all over again, didn't you?

145
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,030
Let her go off to art school
in a wild place like Chicago.

146
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,270
She gets tied up with some cake-eater who
gets her into trouble so he can marry her.

147
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,710
Your lawyer got it annulled.

148
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,640
Damn right I got it annulled.

149
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,610
When I made it clear to "Mr. Cake-Eater"
that I'd cut off her allowance...

150
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,880
...he backed out in a hurry.

151
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,610
She's just a headstrong little flapper...

152
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,780
...but I'll keep her home
and teach her a little discipline.

153
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,790
Yes, sir.

154
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,790
I'm gonna keep that young lady home,
teach her a little discipline.

155
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,490
If you think I'll stay
in this God-forsaken town...

156
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,040
...and have people gossip about me,
you've got another think coming.

157
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,470
I'll really give them something
to gossip about.

158
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,370
Why, Sister, you're up so early!

159
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,440
I can't sleep in this house.

160
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,640
I'm going to California and live
with Aunt Blossom and study art.

161
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,250
Art who?

162
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,720
Welcome home, Miss Virginia.

163
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,010
Phoebe.

164
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,320
I hate it here. I'm a freak in this town.

165
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,330
Everybody stares at me
like I'm something out of a carnival.

166
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,520
'Cause you peroxide your hair
and paint your face like an Indian.

167
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,030
Good morning, everybody.

168
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,960
-Hey, how are you?
-Just great.

169
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,830
He's gonna make me stay home
a whole year just to punish me.

170
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,870
There aren't any more schools left
that'll have you.

171
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,040
There's nothing so distasteful--

172
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,340
This is the ugliest place
in the whole world.

173
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,140
Everywhere you look is an oil well,
even on the front lawn.

174
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,510
I'll bet you'd drill right here
in the dining room.

175
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,450
Damn right I would, if I thought
there was any oil in there.

176
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,550
I'll see you later.

177
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,360
How do you want your eggs, Bud darling?

178
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,350
Come back here
and eat a decent breakfast!

179
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,620
I'm late.

180
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,530
Come back! You can't play a football game
on a breakfast like that!

181
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,540
Neither of my children gets
any real nourishment.

182
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,950
Hey, you want a peach?

183
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,050
What?

184
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,760
Don't! Bud, don't!

185
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,970
Pardonnez-moi.

186
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,730
Wilma Dean, hereafter,
I shall count you tardy...

187
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,240
...if you are not in your seat
when the bell rings.

188
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,140
I'm sorry, Miss Metcalf.

189
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,150
Alan, please.

190
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,310
All right.

191
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,210
For the first few weeks,
we've been reading...

192
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,260
...the stories of King Arthur
and the Knights of the Round Table.

193
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,690
The literature of the age
was characterized by....

194
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,260
All right, Alan?

195
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,770
"By high ideals."

196
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,410
True. And by what else?

197
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,770
You going with us to the football game?

198
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,740
All right, Carolyn?

199
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,720
They were very religious.

200
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,450
Religion was an important part of the lives
of the Knights and their fair ladies.

201
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,350
What else?

202
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,790
I'm going with you, but I'm waiting
for Bud after the game.

203
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,360
We knew that, crazy.

204
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,670
The Knights of the Round Table....

205
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,210
-Just because his father's got money--
-That's not true.

206
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:52,740
Well, they were very brave
and things like that.

207
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,340
Bud Stamper isn't stuck on himself at all.

208
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,380
What in the world do you mean
by "things like that" exactly?

209
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,060
Well, I don't know exactly.

210
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,790
Let us learn to express ourselves
with as much precision as possible.

211
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,670
Juanita, you had your hand up?

212
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,410
The Knights of the Round Table
had a very high regard for women.

213
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,250
In what way, Juanita?

214
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,780
They looked on women as very pure.

215
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,720
They wouldn't look on her as very pure.

216
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,060
All right now, I want it quiet
in this classroom!

217
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,960
The next time there is talking
while this class is in session...

218
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,590
...I am going to send the culprit
to the principal's office.

219
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,000
Yes, Juanita, you're quite right.

220
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,070
The Knights did have a very high regard
for womanhood.

221
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,840
In fact, they put women on a pedestal.

222
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,550
Some people say that chivalry is not dead.

223
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,580
Well, how about it, girls?

224
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,590
Do any of you feel
that you're on a pedestal?

225
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,490
That's unnecessary roughness.

226
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,660
Fifteen yards.

227
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,900
Come on, you've been on me all day!

228
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,010
You're out! You're out of the game!

229
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,680
Who you taking out, Toots?

230
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,220
Never mind who.

231
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,720
Okay, okay, what's so funny about that?

232
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,590
She's the only girl who knows
what it's all about.

233
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,990
You can say that again.

234
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,330
I'll never look twice at those other girls.

235
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:54,000
They expect you to be satisfied
if they even kiss you good night.

236
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,950
Hi, Bud.

237
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,950
Hi, Juanita.

238
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,040
Did you see Toots in there?

239
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,280
Yeah, yeah. He should be right out.

240
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,250
You played a wonderful game.

241
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,050
Thank you.

242
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,160
He should be right out.

243
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,610
Hi, sweetheart.

244
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,910
I suppose you wish I were more
like Juanita Howard, don't you?

245
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,950
What?

246
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,720
I saw the way you were looking at her.
I think she's disgraceful.

247
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,680
The way she stands
waiting for one of the players--

248
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,020
Wait a minute.

249
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,090
There isn't any reason in the world
why I shouldn't speak to her.

250
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,000
You were more than speaking to her.

251
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,630
I'm supposed to not notice her?
Is that what you expect out of me?

252
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,100
I'm not even supposed to know
girls like that exist, huh?

253
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,110
Bud, I'm sorry.

254
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:09,210
-I'm sorry, Bud, honest.
-All right, you're sorry.

255
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,550
Mr. Loomis, a customer for meat.

256
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,120
Bud, please don't be mad.

257
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,920
I'm not mad, Deanie.

258
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,590
Hi, Bud. Deanie.

259
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,390
-Hi, Mr. Loomis.
-Hi, Dad.

260
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,400
I just can't stand it
when you're mad at me.

261
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,110
I don't know what's the matter
with me lately.

262
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,340
I'm always losing my temper.

263
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,220
You're the only girl in the world for me,
you know that?

264
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,680
I want to be.

265
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,290
If it weren't for you....

266
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,260
If it weren't for you, Deanie, I'd....

267
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,230
I don't know!

268
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,310
Bud, it's broad daylight.

269
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,540
-Who cares?
-Stop it. Stop it.

270
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,150
Come on now. Bud! People can see us.

271
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,450
I don't care.

272
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,820
Bud, stop it. Come on now.

273
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,230
Mom?

274
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,000
Mom?

275
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,300
She's not here.

276
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,980
-Mom?
-"Mom? "

277
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,910
Nobody's here.

278
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,670
Stop that.

279
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,050
Yes, Mrs. Harper, here's your change.

280
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,290
Stop it. I have to pull down
the shade to the store.

281
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,700
Bud, stop it.

282
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,180
You're nuts about me, aren't you?

283
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,850
You're nuts about me.

284
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,090
I've got your ten-pound sack
in the back of the store, Mrs. Thatcher.

285
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,610
At my feet, slave!

286
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,750
-Bud, don't.
-Tell me you love me.

287
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,280
-You're hurting me.
-Say you can't live without me.

288
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,350
-Say it!
-I do.

289
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,750
-Do what?
-I do love you.

290
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,550
And you can't live without me.
You'd be everything I ever ask you to be.

291
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,490
I'd do anything for you.

292
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,060
Deanie, I didn't mean to hurt you.

293
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,240
Deanie, I was just kidding.

294
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,140
I'm the one; I should go down
on my knees to you.

295
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,920
I was just kidding.
I thought you knew that.

296
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,420
I can't kid about these things...

297
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,360
...because I am nuts about you.

298
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,400
And I would go down on my knees
to worship you if you really wanted me to.

299
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,600
Bud, I can't get along without you.

300
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,840
And I would do anything you'd ask me to.

301
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,800
I would.

302
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,180
I would.

303
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,510
Anything.

304
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,530
-Let's speak of it at the next meeting.
-I certainly will, if you will.

305
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,680
I'm going in to fix supper now.

306
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,800
-Bye-bye, Nell.
-'Bye, Frieda.

307
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:56,800
Hi, Mom.

308
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,980
The coast is clear.

309
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,110
Are we going to the victory dance?

310
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,050
I can think of things I'd rather do.

311
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,330
I'll be ready.

312
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,310
I'll pick you up right after dinner then.

313
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,250
Did he tell you about his sister Ginny?

314
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,190
No.

315
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,590
Ginny Stamper is too low
for the dogs to bite.

316
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,750
Come here.

317
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:02,930
She met some man in Chicago,
put her in the family way.

318
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,930
Mrs. Stamper had to go out there
and get her, take her to a doctor.

319
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,630
Store's all locked up.

320
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,340
Good.

321
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:18,110
To have one of those
awful operations performed.

322
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,440
Mom, that's gossip.

323
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,080
Every word is true.

324
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,090
I was at the DAR and heard all about it.

325
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,020
Mrs. Whitcomb lives across the street
from the Stampers...

326
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,620
...and she knows everything
that goes on in their house.

327
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,120
That's what happens to girls
who go wild and boy-crazy.

328
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,310
Well, congratulations, Son!

329
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,790
The game, boy, the game.

330
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,450
Thank you.

331
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,700
I'll run along upstairs and....

332
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,030
Dad, I have to talk to you.

333
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,910
I've just about had all the nonsense
I intend to take out of you.

334
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,950
Get out of here, young lady.
I'm gonna have a talk with my boy.

335
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,690
All right, Son.

336
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,830
All right, go ahead.

337
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,120
Dad, I'm gonna marry Deanie.

338
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,360
Whoa now, Son.

339
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,330
You see, I don't really wanna go to Yale.

340
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,170
I'm not a very good student.

341
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,210
What do you mean
you're not a good student?

342
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,440
Boy, you can do anything
you set your mind to do.

343
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,210
I'd like to go to a good agricultural college
for a couple of years.

344
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,380
I'd really like to do that.
I could come right back here...

345
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,790
...and take over your ranch
just south of town.

346
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,260
Ranching's no life.

347
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,790
I could marry Deanie,
take her to college with me.

348
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,300
That's what I really want.
She'd be a big help to me, Dad.

349
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,960
I spent my life trying to create a place
of importance for you in this world...

350
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,870
...then you come home telling me
you want to marry some little girl!

351
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,510
It's what I want that counts.

352
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,540
Son, a boy your age doesn't even know
what he wants.

353
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,950
After you've had a college education,
you might change your mind.

354
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,180
A college education
will take me four years.

355
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,850
-Trust me.
-I do trust you, but--

356
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,320
-Trust me this time, Son.
-I trust you, Dad.

357
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,720
I do trust you, but four years--

358
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,030
Listen to me now.

359
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,860
But, Dad....

360
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,730
Son, all I'm asking you to do is
to finish Yale.

361
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:56,830
Then if you still want to marry her,
return and marry her with my blessing.

362
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,910
I'll send you both off to Europe
for a honeymoon.

363
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,500
Bud, please wait, Son.

364
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,770
I just don't know if I can, Dad.

365
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,020
I feel like I'm going nuts sometimes.

366
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,980
I understand, Son.

367
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,590
Your old man understands, Son.

368
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:23,960
What you need for the time being is...

369
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,340
...a different kind of girl.

370
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:32,030
When I was a boy, Son,
there was always two kinds of girls.

371
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,770
Us boys, we'd never even mention them
in the same breath...

372
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,680
...but every now and then one of us boys
would sneak off with a girl...

373
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:46,720
...and we'd get a little steam
out of our system.

374
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,950
No girl looks good to me except Deanie.

375
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,720
I know, Son.

376
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,820
I know.

377
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,990
I love her, Dad.

378
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,030
I know, Son, I know.

379
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,600
See, I don't want to do that.

380
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,350
Okay, I'll go to Yale.

381
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,000
But I want to tell you now,
I'll marry her as soon as I get out.

382
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,120
That's a promise.

383
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,790
-I want you to remember that.
-It's a promise.

384
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,230
It's a promise, Son. I'll send you both
off to Europe on a honeymoon.

385
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,000
-That's a promise.
-Okay.

386
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,440
Bud, I'll wait for you.

387
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,980
I'll wait for you forever.

388
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,080
I'll do anything you want, Bud.

389
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:03,900
Yes, it's a time of great prosperity
for us all, and we must give thanks.

390
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,640
But let us not forget Christ's warning
to the multitude.

391
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,300
"Lay not up treasures for yourselves
on earth...

392
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,910
"...where moth and rust doth corrupt...

393
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,780
"...and where thieves break through
and steal:

394
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:26,150
"But lay up for yourselves treasures
in heaven...

395
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,980
"...where neither moth nor rust
doth corrupt...

396
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,760
"...and where thieves do not
break through and steal:

397
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,130
"For where your treasure is,
there will your heart be also."

398
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,000
Fine sermon. Fine sermon.

399
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,550
Let us pray.

400
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:02,460
Take my advice, Del.
Hang onto those stocks of yours.

401
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,220
This comedian said,
"You ain't seen nothing yet."

402
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,730
We're hanging on.

403
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,190
Fine sermon, Reverend, fine sermon.

404
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,090
Wonderful passage.

405
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,610
Don't light a cigarette
in front of all these church people!

406
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,940
Do you want me to be a hypocrite?

407
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:33,450
Who would've thought that one day
our kids would be, well, engaged sort of?

408
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,550
I'm mighty proud
of my son's choice, Frieda.

409
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,590
I'm mighty proud of your boy, too.

410
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,790
Excuse us, honey.

411
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,420
I'll see you at dinner tonight. Don't forget.

412
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,640
Dad, I'm no spy.

413
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,940
All I'm asking you to do is keep an eye
on her while I'm in New York.

414
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:03,750
She likes you, Son. She won't do
anything crazy when you're around.

415
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:18,330
Virginia, I told you, your father has
the key to that cabinet...

416
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:20,600
...and he's on the train to New York.

417
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,000
That's him all over. He keeps it locked.

418
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,470
He doesn't think
anybody should drink but him.

419
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,340
You may be shocking Glenn.

420
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:31,070
Virginia, after all,
we do have prohibition, you know.

421
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,740
Maybe Glenn doesn't approve of drinking.

422
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,550
Quick, Henry, the flit.

423
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:40,250
Has your family lived long in town?

424
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:45,920
They just moved here from Oklahoma.

425
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,890
Oh, I see.

426
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,660
Is your father engaged
in some business in town?

427
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,810
His father is looking for work
and Glenn works at the filling station...

428
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:04,370
...on the corner of Sycamore and Main.
Anything else you'd like to know?

429
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,810
Ginny, I see no reason at all
for your bad nature.

430
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,180
Bud, you're not eating a thing.

431
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,580
I'm bored!

432
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,620
Come on, let's go.

433
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,820
There's a lovely dessert coming.

434
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:20,290
I don't want a lovely dessert.
Glenn and I are going for a ride.

435
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,490
Come on.

436
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,760
Deanie and I'll go with you and Glenn.

437
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,140
Wake up.

438
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:40,310
Hey, Buddy boy, you're a Boy Scout.
Run in and build us a nice, hot fire.

439
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,750
My hair's a mess.

440
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,990
Where?

441
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,250
Here.

442
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,520
Stop it. Stop it.

443
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,690
"Everybody's wild about Mabel

444
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,090
"She's the talk of the town

445
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,390
"Mabel's willing and able

446
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,730
"To show a guy around

447
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,070
"She's a tease, she's a flirt

448
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,870
"You better watch out or you'll get hurt"

449
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,940
Good, Buddy boy.
Now, how about a drink?

450
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,880
I forgot, Buddy boy's in training.

451
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,650
What about you, Deanie girl?
You want a drink?

452
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,280
Come on, Deanie.

453
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:26,320
Come on, have a little drink. Come on.
Or is Deanie girl in training, too?

454
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,190
Lay off, Ginny.

455
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,990
Why don't you relax?

456
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,760
You're just standing around
like a chaperone.

457
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:37,570
Is that what you came out here for,
just to chaperone Glenn and me?

458
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,040
Ain't he pretty, Deanie, huh?

459
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:45,440
My handsome filling-station attendant.

460
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,650
Fill me up, please, I'm empty.

461
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,520
Come on, honey, let's go for a walk.

462
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,590
All right.

463
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,460
Yeah, why don't you go
for a walk upstairs?

464
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,500
Why don't you quit trying to pretend
you're so pure and righteous?

465
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,070
If you weren't my sister--

466
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,930
If I weren't your sister,
you wouldn't do anything.

467
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,530
You never do anything
except what Dad tells you.

468
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,240
Isn't that right, Deanie?
You been finding that out, haven't you?

469
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,940
He just lets things torment him inside
and make him miserable...

470
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,510
...and he never does anything about them.

471
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,520
He never does anything.

472
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,390
'Bye.

473
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,970
All this is gonna be ours someday.

474
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,540
This is the most wonderful Christmas
I've ever had.

475
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:55,450
Isn't it beautiful? Oh, Dad,
it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

476
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,920
I wonder what Bud paid for it?

477
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,080
Why do you always think about the cost?

478
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,220
If you want to know,
I wish it was a lot less and was a ring.

479
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:06,060
-Don't, Mom, don't.
-Four years, you'll be....

480
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,820
All right, all right.

481
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:12,590
I just wish that Bud Stamper
had a little more gumption.

482
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,670
Always drink plenty of milk, Deanie.

483
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,910
Still.

484
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,230
Still.

485
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,500
One, two. There.

486
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,050
Thank you.

487
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,540
One more, please.

488
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:28,310
I don't know why I couldn't have had a car.

489
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,040
Why should I buy you a car?
You got your mother's coupe.

490
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,640
That coupe is a wreck.

491
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,210
-What have you done with your hair?
-I just put a henna rinse in it.

492
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,120
Still.

493
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,480
Still.

494
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,820
I'll get it.

495
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,630
One. Two. There.

496
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,730
Thank God that's over.

497
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,240
-Hi, Ginny.
-Oh, Brian.

498
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,440
My parents are in there.

499
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:59,680
-Perfume?
-Arpege.

500
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,270
It's my favorite.
I just have to slip on my dress.

501
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,380
Come meet the folks. Come on.

502
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,660
They're kind of dull,
but you can stand them for a few minutes.

503
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:11,980
Go on!

504
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:19,330
-Hello. I'm Ace Stamper.
-I'm Brian Stacey.

505
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,730
-What can I do for you?
-I'm waiting for Ginny.

506
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,040
She may take forever. Come on in.
This is my son, Bud.

507
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,770
Come here, Son.

508
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,380
The boy's captain of the football team.
You heard about him?

509
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,970
I don't get to many games.

510
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,570
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

511
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,670
This is my wife, Mrs. Stamper.

512
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,750
Won't you come in?

513
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,710
Ginny, I want to talk to you.

514
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,080
Come on in.

515
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,760
Ginny, I know who that guy is.

516
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,960
That guy's a bootlegger.

517
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,660
Is he? Here, do me up.

518
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,460
He's married. Do you know that?

519
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,270
How do you know so much about him,
sweetie-pie?

520
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,170
-You're not going out with him.
-Is that so?

521
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,400
-Try to stop me.
-This is Christmas Day.

522
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:39,480
You'll stay home and you'll be decent
to your mother.

523
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,910
-You're not leaving!
-Get out of my way!

524
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,170
If you want to listen to Dad, go ahead.

525
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,470
One of these days you'll find out.

526
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,910
You'll find out and then God help you.

527
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,180
All right, calm down, everybody.
Come on now, just calm down!

528
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,520
All right, boys, give me a fanfare.
Give me a fanfare.

529
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,490
You people, shut up in there!

530
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,390
Let's crowd around here,
crowd around here.

531
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,540
We'll bring this New Year in right.

532
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,410
For Joe!

533
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,160
Happy New Year!

534
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,790
You look lovely, boy!

535
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:34,020
You're the prettiest baby here!

536
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,640
Shake that jelly.

537
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,000
Look, Daddy. Happy New Year!

538
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,980
Shake that jelly. Shake it! Shake it!

539
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,550
Daddy, look at us.

540
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,080
Daddy, look!

541
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,590
Come on, move aside.
Hey, let me through there.

542
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:05,990
Hey, Smokey boy,
let me ring your doorbell.

543
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:10,360
Happy New Year, Daddy.

544
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,670
You cut that out!

545
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,900
You behave yourself.
You behave yourself, you hear me?

546
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,570
Mr. Stamper, the perfume is coming in.

547
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,670
Yeah, perfume for all the ladies.

548
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,340
Line up, ladies.
Line up to get your perfume.

549
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:32,150
Come on, get your perfume,
all you ladies.

550
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:37,250
Happy New Year, Son.
Go on, get in line. There's some for you.

551
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,350
It will be a great year for both of us.

552
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:46,560
-Dance with me, Dick?
-No thanks, Ginny.

553
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,170
Boy, oh boy, she's really plastered.

554
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,580
Hello, Bill.

555
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,720
She's disgraceful.

556
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,220
It's all she can do to walk.

557
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,750
Why don't her folks
do something about her?

558
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,620
What did she do to her hair?

559
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,690
Charley, will you dance with me?

560
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:13,090
Not right now, Ginny.

561
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,020
I didn't know you were married.

562
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,450
Hey, look out!

563
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,320
What do you think you're doing?

564
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:52,400
Happy New Year, Joe!

565
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,160
Go get your sister, Son,
and take her on home.

566
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,300
-Hey, Sis.
-Happy New Year.

567
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:01,740
Happy New Year.

568
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,900
-Happy New Year.
-What's happy about it?

569
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,380
You want to dance?

570
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:14,150
Where are you taking me?

571
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:20,250
-Where are you taking me?
-Sis, let me take you home.

572
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:20,990
No!

573
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,100
No, I'm not going home.

574
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,890
-Can I do your dress up?
-No.

575
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,370
You're all unsnapped here.

576
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:31,070
Get away. I'm not going home.
And you don't have to dance with me.

577
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:34,640
Ginny, I like to dance
with a good-looking girl once in a while.

578
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:39,340
If you weren't my brother
you wouldn't even come near me.

579
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:41,440
You're a nice boy! You're nice!

580
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,980
I know what you nice boys are like.

581
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:46,110
I know, you only talk to me in the dark!

582
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,380
In the dark!

583
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,250
You talk to me then, don't you?

584
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,890
You talk to me in the dark, in automobiles!
You talk to me!

585
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,520
You're very familiar then, aren't you?

586
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:57,830
Get away from me!

587
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:15,680
Joe, where have you been?

588
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,960
-Where's Joe?
-Here I am.

589
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,780
Come on, Joe. Let's go.

590
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,210
Where?

591
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,580
Anywhere!

592
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,050
Let's go, honey.

593
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,820
Happy New Year!

594
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,220
Hey, come on.

595
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,790
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.

596
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,210
I'm dizzy.

597
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:34,400
No!

598
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,170
Did you see where Arnold went?

599
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,740
-You get stood up, Kay?
-It looks like it.

600
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:43,860
Bud, would you be an angel, huh?

601
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:48,580
-I'll love you for the rest of my life.
-I'll go look for him.

602
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,160
Cut it out, it's his sister!

603
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,870
Now lay off, Bill!

604
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:19,370
Cut it out, I tell you, she's his sister.
He's gone mad.

605
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,180
Stop this fight! Stop this fight!

606
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,540
It wasn't his fault. No one's to blame.

607
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:30,680
Let's go.

608
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,740
Come on inside a minute. Okay?

609
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:44,280
-Do you wanna come inside?
-No.

610
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:47,760
We gotta stop all this kissing
and fooling around, Deanie.

611
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:51,070
Tell me what's happened.

612
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,760
I just don't think we'd better
see each other for a while.

613
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,970
I have to go. Goodbye.

614
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,320
We planned the whole play around you.

615
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:17,020
You're supposed to be there.
What's the matter?

616
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:18,390
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry, my foot!

617
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:20,330
-You keep training?
-Yes, sir.

618
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:22,160
-Hours? Diet?
-Yes, sir.

619
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:24,200
All right, let's try it again.

620
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:26,100
I said, let's try it again.

621
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,970
I want very much to say this:

622
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,770
I want to give most of you
a high compliment on your term paper.

623
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:40,100
They're the best set of papers
I've ever received.

624
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,200
Bud?

625
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,760
Just a minute.

626
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:09,740
There's something I've got to tell you.

627
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:13,140
Your term paper was not very good.

628
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,410
Well, I guess so.

629
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,920
Remember, you've got to do much better...

630
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,780
...if you're going to get into Yale in the fall.

631
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,930
Hi.

632
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:31,900
I miss you, Bud.

633
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,870
I just wanted to wish you good luck
on the game.

634
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:41,440
Thanks.

635
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,370
Dr. Smiley.

636
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,520
-Doc?
-Yes, Bud.

637
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:28,680
-What happened?
-You tell me.

638
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,820
What do you want? What is it?

639
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:32,260
What's wrong with him?

640
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,390
He just had a fall.
There's nothing to worry about at all.

641
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,660
104°. I recommend the hospital.
There's a lot of pneumonia around.

642
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,530
-Pneumonia?
-My God!

643
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,230
Yes, I know.

644
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:59,750
I've signed my name to this check.

645
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:02,780
Pull my boy through
and I'm willing to give you a bonus.

646
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:05,290
You just fill out the amount,
$5,000, $10,000--

647
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,190
I'm doing everything that can be done.

648
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,820
You just fill out the amount.

649
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:12,300
I think the boy's going to be all right,
but if he isn't....

650
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,600
What do you mean, "if he isn't"?

651
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:18,660
Ace, I'm not a very religious man,
but I know what every doctor knows.

652
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,310
You can't reckon with the will of God.

653
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:30,150
Just say whatever is in your heart,
Wilma Dean.

654
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,450
All I can think of is, "Dear God,
make him well, make him well."

655
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,290
Then that's your prayer.

656
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:41,730
But aren't there some words I should say
out of the Bible?

657
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,000
I can't think of any that would be better
than your own.

658
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:06,480
Oh, please, God, make him well.

659
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,020
Make him well.

660
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:28,270
Well, Bud, in another week or so
you'll be feeling yourself again.

661
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:30,510
Then spring will be here.

662
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:34,880
You know what happens
to a young man's fancy in the springtime.

663
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:40,850
-You go with Del Loomis' girl, don't you?
-Yeah.

664
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,520
Mighty attractive girl.

665
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:45,550
She sure is.

666
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:53,600
-I'm pretty nuts about Deanie Loomis.
-I don't blame you.

667
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,330
I mean, I love her.

668
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,270
And she loves me.

669
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,000
But it's no fun to be in love. It hurts.

670
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,710
Every time that we're together...

671
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:11,710
...I have to...

672
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,950
...remember things.
You know what I mean?

673
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:16,960
Oh, yes.

674
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:20,720
I just can't go back to seeing her again.

675
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,960
Not like the way we were doing.
We'd go out every night and...

676
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,870
...I'd hold her and I'd kiss her and...

677
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,230
...I'd just go home.

678
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:39,710
I mean, a guy can go nuts that way.

679
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,450
I don't know how to advise you, Bud.

680
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,960
My dad said...

681
00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:00,360
...that I should get another kind of a girl.

682
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,470
No.

683
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:07,840
But when you don't really want
another girl....

684
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,670
No.

685
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,280
I don't know.

686
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:22,020
Come in again Friday, Bud.
I'll give you another shot of iron...

687
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,020
...and another sun-lamp treatment.

688
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:31,260
Okay, Doc.

689
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:34,160
So long.

690
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:26,610
Hi, Deanie.

691
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,350
And that was the surest way to lose him.

692
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:32,790
What did you say?

693
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,960
-He's an animal.
-He is not.

694
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,560
-Yes, he is. I met him.
-You don't know him.

695
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:39,190
Who's an animal?

696
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,630
-You're out.
-I am not.

697
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:50,800
Yes, you are.

698
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:53,970
-I hurt my finger.
-I'll kiss it and make it better.

699
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:33,780
"What though the radiance
which was once so bright

700
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:37,050
"Is now for ever taken from my sight...

701
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:42,230
"Though nothing can bring back the hour
Of splendor in the grass...

702
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:44,230
"...of glory in the flower;

703
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:48,700
"We will grieve not, rather find

704
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:51,860
"Strength in what remains behind...."

705
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,010
What do you suppose the poet means
by these lines?

706
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,730
Deanie Loomis?

707
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:17,760
I'm sorry, Miss Metcalf.

708
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,340
I didn't hear the question.

709
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:25,770
I know it's spring but I must ask you
to pay more attention.

710
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:27,800
I'm sorry.

711
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,680
I quoted some lines from Wordsworth's
Ode on Intimations of Immortality.

712
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:33,840
Did you hear them?

713
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,720
I'm afraid not, Miss Metcalf.

714
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,550
Then I must ask you to turn your text
to Page 380.

715
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,690
Yes, l....

716
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:59,630
You read the lines to me.

717
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,340
Yes.

718
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,840
Stand please.

719
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:19,020
"Though nothing can bring back the hour

720
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:21,030
"Of splendor in the grass...

721
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,130
"...of glory in the flower;

722
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,170
"We will grieve not, rather find

723
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:33,440
"Strength in what remains behind...."

724
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:37,100
Perhaps you can tell me
exactly what the poet means...

725
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:39,700
...by such expressions as
"splendor in the grass"...

726
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:41,750
...and "glory in the flower."

727
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:51,620
I think it has some....

728
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:53,530
Yes?

729
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:00,060
Well, when we're young...

730
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,870
...we look at things very idealistically,
I guess.

731
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:13,970
And I think Wordsworth means...

732
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:18,350
...that when we grow up...

733
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:29,420
...that we have to forget
the ideals of youth...

734
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:33,200
...and find strength....

735
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:47,840
Miss Metcalf...

736
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,210
...may I please be....

737
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,490
Children!

738
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:05,820
I'll go see what's the matter.

739
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:17,980
-Hi, June.
-Hi.

740
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:21,550
I just gave her a sedative.

741
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:24,380
-I'm not sick.
-She'll be all right in a little while.

742
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,610
Now lie down.

743
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,210
I'm all right. I'm perfectly all right.

744
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,590
Stop that.

745
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,060
I'm all right.

746
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:45,130
I don't care if his father is making
my folks rich. I hate Bud Stamper.

747
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,710
-You'd take a date if he asked you.
-I would not.

748
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:50,330
-You know you would.
-I absolutely would not.

749
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:51,710
Here he comes.

750
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:54,750
Hi.

751
01:02:58,950 --> 01:02:59,980
All right.

752
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:21,170
Why aren't you going out
for track this year?

753
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,710
Got all that work to make up
from when I was sick.

754
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:26,910
You going to Yale? You going to Yale?

755
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:29,310
Yeah, if my grades are good enough.

756
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:33,220
How come you're not dating Deanie
anymore?

757
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,520
I'm just not.

758
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:38,560
I guess I'll just go to cow college.
I'm only a farmer and I know it.

759
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,630
Hot dog! Now it's my chance.

760
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:43,190
Any objections?

761
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:49,300
I can't stop you.
