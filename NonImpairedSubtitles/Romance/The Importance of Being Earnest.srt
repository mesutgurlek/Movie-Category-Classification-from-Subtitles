1
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,130
Hey! Hey!

2
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,217
There he is!

3
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,977
Where's he going?

4
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,191
-Uhh!
-Bastard!

5
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,651
Stop!

6
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,862
You won't get away, sir!

7
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:11,947
Time to pay your debt.

8
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,156
Hey!

9
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,410
WOOh!

10
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:28,881
Uhh!

11
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,802
Ohh.

12
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,864
Did you hear
what I was playing, Lane?

13
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:56,909
I didn't think it polite
to listen, sir.

14
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,370
I'm sorry for that,
for your sake.

15
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:05,250
I don't play accurately--
anyone can play accurately--

16
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,253
but I play with
wonderful expression.

17
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,963
Yes, sir.

18
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,467
Bills, bills, bills--
all I ever get is bills.

19
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,968
And then
there's the matter...

20
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,471
of my unpaid wages sir.

21
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,772
Yet again the wasteful habits
of my brother Ernest...

22
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,565
tear me from my duties here.

23
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,983
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,735
It's a terrible nuisance,
but there's nothing to be done.

25
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,988
I shall return Monday afternoon.

26
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,989
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,705
Pay particular attention.
If you will Miss Prism...

28
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,082
to her German grammar.

29
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,583
Yes, Mr. Worthing.

30
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,299
I don't suppose you've
found my cigarette case...

31
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,509
have you, Merriman?

32
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,969
We're still looking, sir.

33
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,471
Walk on.

34
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,415
Hey!

35
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,943
Excuse me.

36
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,659
Whoo-Whoo-Whoo-Whoo!

37
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,666
Ernest!

38
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,129
-Algy!
-How are you, my dear Ernest?

39
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,757
-What brings you up to town?
-Oh, pleasure, pleasure.

40
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,050
What else should
bring one anywhere?

41
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,469
Where have you been
since last Thursday?

42
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:21,803
In the country.

43
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,764
You're always in the country.
What on earth do you do there?

44
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,557
Well, when one is in town,
one amuses oneself.

45
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,684
When one is in the country,
one amuses other people.

46
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,061
It's excessively boring.

47
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:31,855
-Who are these people you amuse?
-Oh, neighbors, neighbors.

48
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,565
Nice neighbors in
your part of Shropshire?

49
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,317
Perfectly horrid.
Never speak to one of them.

50
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,194
How immensely
you must amuse them.

51
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,072
By the way, Shropshire
is your country, is it not?

52
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,406
-What?
-Shropshire.

53
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,574
-Shropshire?
-Mm.

54
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,992
Oh, yes, of course.

55
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,539
Say dear boy...

56
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,666
What plans have you got
for tea tomorrow?

57
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,750
You know perfectly well...

58
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,585
that Aunt Augusta is
coming to tea tomorrow.

59
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:58,090
-Aunt Augusta?
-Yes, Aunt Augusta...

60
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,675
And Gwendolen.

61
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,554
How perfectly delightful.

62
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:08,392
Perhaps I might pay my respects.

63
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,102
Yes, that is all very well,
but I'm afraid Aunt Augusta...

64
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,395
won't approve
of your being there.

65
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:12,646
Why do you say that?

66
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,439
My dear fellow, the way
that you flirt with Gwendolen...

67
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,941
is perfectly disgraceful.

68
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,402
It's almost as bad as the way
Gwendolen flirts with you.

69
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,697
-I am in love with Gwendolen.
-Ahh.

70
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:24,324
And I have come up to town
expressly to propose to her.

71
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,076
I thought you came up
for pleasure.

72
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,744
I call that business.

73
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,371
Oh, how utterly
unromantic you are.

74
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,582
I really don't see what there
is romantic about proposing.

75
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:33,917
Why, one may be accepted.
One usually is, I believe.

76
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,795
And then--Ha ha!--
the excitement is over.

77
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:42,509
No. The very essence of
romance is uncertainty.

78
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:47,306
Twenty-five a player.

79
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,144
Anyway, I certainly
can't see...

80
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,313
you and Gwendolen
being married.

81
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:55,647
Why on earth do you say that?

82
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,482
Well, in the first place,
I don't give my consent.

83
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,734
Your consent?

84
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,819
My dear fellow,
Gwendolen is my cousin...

85
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,863
and before I allow you
to marry her...

86
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:06,533
you shall have to clear up
this whole question of Cecily.

87
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,076
-Cecily?
-Mm.

88
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,162
What on earth do you mean?

89
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,539
I don't know anyone
by the name of Cecily.

90
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,876
Do you mean you have had
my cigarette case all this time?

91
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,544
I wish to goodness
you had let me know.

92
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,047
I've been writing frantic
letters to Scotland Yard.

93
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,924
I was very nearly offering
a very large reward.

94
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,258
I wish you would offer one.

95
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,385
I happen to be more
than usually hard up.

96
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,888
It makes no matter...

97
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,556
for I see now the thing
isn't yours after all.

98
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,724
Of course it's mine.

99
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,142
You have seen me with it
a hundred times.

100
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,435
Not according
to the inscription.

101
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,686
And you have
no right whatsoever...

102
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,021
to read what is written inside.

103
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,523
It is a very
ungentlemanly thing...

104
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,149
to read
a private cigarette case.

105
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,901
Yes, but this isn't
your cigarette case.

106
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,736
This cigarette case
is a present from someone...

107
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,279
of the name of Cecily,
and you said...

108
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,781
you didn't know
anyone of that name.

109
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,995
Well, if you want to know,
Cecily happens to be my aunt.

110
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,289
Your aunt?

111
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,707
Yes. Charming old lady
she is, too.

112
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,001
Lives at Tunbridge Wells.
Just give it back to me, Algy.

113
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:02,297
Yes, but why does your aunt
call you her uncle?

114
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,717
Hmm?

115
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,097
Ahh.

116
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,766
"From little Cecily,
with her fondest love...

117
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,477
"to her dear Uncle Jack."
Mmm.

118
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:19,356
There is no objection, I admit,
to an aunt being a small aunt...

119
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:22,067
but why an aunt, no matter
what her size may be...

120
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,278
should call
her own nephew her uncle...

121
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,238
I can't quite make out.

122
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,615
Besides, your name isn't
Jack at all--it's Ernest.

123
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,201
It isn't Ernest, it's Jack.

124
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,122
You've always told me
it was Ernest.

125
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,040
I've introduced you
to everyone as Ernest.

126
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,835
It is perfectly absurd your
saying your name isn't Ernest.

127
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,712
It's on your cards.
Here is one of them.

128
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,506
"Mr. Ernest Worthing,
B.4, The Albany."

129
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:48,260
Well, it is Ernest in town
and Jack in the country...

130
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,221
and the cigarette case
was given to me in the country.

131
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,768
So I've always pretended
to have a younger brother.

132
00:07:56,768 --> 00:08:01,231
Ah, of the name of Ernest.
And little Cecily?

133
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,109
My ward, Miss Cecily Cardew.

134
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,737
Where is that place
in the country by the way?

135
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,614
That is nothing
to you dear boy.

136
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,824
You are certainly not
going to be invited.

137
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,243
I may tell you candidly
the place is not in Shropshire.

138
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,953
Oh, I suspected that,
my dear fellow...

139
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:18,457
just as I suspected you
to be a Bunburyist.

140
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:22,127
Indeed, you are one
of the most advanced...

141
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,837
Bunburyists I know.

142
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,925
See you at five.

143
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,054
Moncrieff!

144
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:34,431
A quick word, sir!

145
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,142
"Bunburyist"?

146
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,813
Cecily, your German grammar
is on the table.

147
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,066
Pray open it at page fifteen.

148
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,235
We will repeat
yesterday's lesson.

149
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,320
But I don't like German.

150
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,822
It isn't at all
a becoming language.

151
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,449
I know perfectly well...

152
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,993
I look quite plain
after my German lesson.

153
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,371
Child, you know how
anxious your guardian is...

154
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,873
that you should improve
yourself in every way.

155
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,709
Dear Uncle Jack
is so very serious.

156
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:07,005
Sometimes I think he is so
serious he cannot be quite well.

157
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,299
Cecily, I'm surprised at you.

158
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,261
Mr. Worthing has many
troubles in his life.

159
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:14,888
You must remember
his constant anxiety...

160
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:19,017
about that unfortunate
young man, his brother.

161
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,145
I wish Uncle Jack would allow
that unfortunate young man...

162
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,023
his brother,
to come down here sometimes.

163
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,317
We might have a good influence
over him, Miss Prism.

164
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,195
I'm not sure that I would
desire to reclaim him.

165
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,990
I'm not in favor
of this modern mania...

166
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,741
for turning bad people
into good people...

167
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,869
at a moment's notice.

168
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,166
Cecily?

169
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,043
Do your work child.

170
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:51,341
He, she, it praises.

171
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,178
"Bunburyist"?

172
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,263
What on earth do you mean
by a "Bunburyist"?

173
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:59,641
You have invented
a very useful younger brother...

174
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,477
called Ernest in order
that you may be able...

175
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,438
to come up to town
as often as you like.

176
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,148
I have invented...

177
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:09,776
an invaluable permanent
invalid called Bunbury...

178
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,362
in order that I may
be able to go down...

179
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,073
to the country
as often as I choose.

180
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,284
If it wasn't for Bunbury's
extraordinary bad health...

181
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,952
for instance, I wouldn't
be able to dine with you...

182
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,746
at the Savoy tonight,
for I've had an appointment...

183
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,247
with Aunt Augusta
for more than a week.

184
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,249
I haven't asked you to dine
with me anywhere tonight.

185
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,585
I know.
You're absurdly careless...

186
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,420
about giving out invitations.

187
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,422
Don't touch
the cucumber sandwiches.

188
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,508
They were ordered
especially for Aunt Augusta.

189
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:34,218
You've been eating them
all the time.

190
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:35,511
Well, that is quite
a different matter.

191
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:36,845
She is my aunt.

192
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:39,973
That must be her.

193
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,184
Only relatives
or creditors ever ring...

194
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,061
in that Wagnerian manner.

195
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:47,773
Now, if I manage to get her
out of the way for 10 minutes...

196
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,399
so that you may have
an opportunity...

197
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,943
for proposing to Gwendolen...

198
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:53,445
may I dine with you
at the Savoy tonight?

199
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:03,872
Lady Bracknell
and Miss Fairfax.

200
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,624
Good afternoon, dear Algy.

201
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,168
I hope you are
behaving very well.

202
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,878
I'm feeling very well,
Aunt Augusta.

203
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,297
That's not quite
the same thing.

204
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,466
In fact, the two things
rarely go together.

205
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,093
Lady Bracknell, l--

206
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:18,887
Oh, goodness, you are smart.

207
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,181
I'm always smart.
Am I not, Mr. Worthing?

208
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,767
You are quite perfect,
Miss Fairfax.

209
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,143
I hope I am not that.

210
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,271
It would leave no room
for development...

211
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:30,816
and I intend to develop
in many directions.

212
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:33,569
I'm sorry if
we're a little late Algy.

213
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,696
I was obliged to call
on dear Lady Harbury.

214
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,906
I had not been there since
her poor husband's death.

215
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,325
I never saw a woman so altered.

216
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:43,453
She looks quite
twenty years younger.

217
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,707
And now I'll have a cup
of tea and one of those...

218
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,293
nice cucumber sandwiches
you promised me.

219
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:50,460
Certainly, Aunt Augusta.

220
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,422
Won't you sit here, Gwendolen?

221
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:55,465
Thanks, Mama, I'm quite
comfortable where I am.

222
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,678
Good heavens, Lane, why are
there no cucumber sandwiches?

223
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:02,431
There were no cucumbers
in the market this morning, sir.

224
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,933
-I went down twice.
-Oh, no cucumbers?

225
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,852
No, sir.
Not even for ready money.

226
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,979
-That will do, Lane.
-Thank you, sir.

227
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,614
I am greatly distressed,
Aunt Augusta...

228
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:22,034
about there being no cucumbers,
not even for ready money.

229
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,994
It really makes no matter, Algy.

230
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:26,538
I had some crumpets
with Lady Harbury.

231
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:29,208
I've got quite a treat
for you tonight, Algy.

232
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,460
I'm going to send you
down with Mary Farquhar.

233
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,754
-She is such a nice--
-I'm afraid, Aunt Augusta...

234
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,172
I shall have to give up
the pleasure...

235
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,757
of dining with you tonight.

236
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,091
I hope not, Algy.

237
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,677
It will put my table
completely out.

238
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,721
It is a great bore,
and I need hardly say...

239
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:43,972
a terrible disappointment
to me...

240
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,349
but I've just had
a telegram to say...

241
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,601
that my poor friend Bunbury
is very ill again.

242
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,646
They seem to think
I should be with him.

243
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:52,231
Very strange.

244
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:54,149
This Mr. Bunbury
seems to suffer...

245
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,401
from curiously bad health.

246
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,238
Yes, poor Bunbury
is a dreadful invalid.

247
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:01,532
I must say Algy.
I think it is high time...

248
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:05,035
Mr. Bunbury made up his mind
whether to live or die.

249
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:07,496
This shilly-shallying with
the question is absurd.

250
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,414
I should be much obliged
if you would ask...

251
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,875
Mr. Bunbury from me
to be kind enough...

252
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,794
not to have a relapse
next Saturday.

253
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,255
It is my last reception,
and I rely on you...

254
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:18,799
to arrange my music for me.

255
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,926
I'll speak to Bunbury,
Aunt Augusta...

256
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,386
if he's still conscious.

257
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,388
Now, if you'll follow me
into the next room...

258
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:25,931
I'll run over
the musical program...

259
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,558
I've already drawn up
for the occasion.

260
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,560
Thank you, Algy.

261
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,687
It is very
thoughtful of you.

262
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,232
Gwendolen,
you will accompany me.

263
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,192
Certainly, Mama.

264
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,873
Charming day it has been,
Miss Fairfax.

265
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,876
Pray don't talk to me about
the weather, Mr. Worthing.

266
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,836
Whenever people talk
to me about the weather...

267
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:59,173
I always feel quite certain
that they mean something else...

268
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,008
and that makes me so nervous.

269
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,552
-I do mean something else.
-I thought so.

270
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:05,137
And I would like
to take advantage...

271
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,889
of Lady Bracknell's
temporary absence--

272
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,932
I would certainly
advise you to do so.

273
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,059
Mama has a way of coming back
suddenly into a room...

274
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,187
that I've often had
to speak to her about.

275
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,942
Miss Fairfax,
ever since I met you...

276
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,986
I have admired you
more than any girl...

277
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:25,240
I have ever met since
I met you.

278
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,910
Yes. I'm quite aware
of the fact.

279
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,496
And I often wish that
in public, at any rate...

280
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:32,623
you had been
more demonstrative.

281
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:36,084
For me...

282
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,420
you have always had
an irresistible fascination.

283
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,630
Gwendolen--

284
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,548
Even before I met you...

285
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,634
I was far from
indifferent to you.

286
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:50,682
We live, as I hope you know,
Mr. Worthing...

287
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:54,978
in an age of ideals,
and my ideal has always been...

288
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,190
to love someone
of the name of Ernest.

289
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,527
There's something
in that name...

290
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:04,112
that inspires
absolute confidence.

291
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,281
The moment Algy
first mentioned to me...

292
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,492
that he had a friend
called Ernest...

293
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:12,663
I knew I was destined
to love you.

294
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:16,083
-You really love me, Gwendolen?
-Passionately.

295
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,127
Darling, you don't know
how happy you've made me.

296
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,587
My own Ernest.

297
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:24,466
You don't mean
to say though, dear...

298
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,969
you couldn't love me
if my name wasn't Ernest.

299
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,137
But your name is Ernest.

300
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,889
Yes, I know it is...

301
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,851
but supposing
it was something else?

302
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:39,439
Ah well, that is clearly
a metaphysical speculation...

303
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,902
and like most
metaphysical speculations...

304
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:46,572
has very little
reference at all...

305
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:50,075
to the actual facts
of real life as we know them.

306
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,204
Personally, darling,
to speak quite candidly...

307
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,623
I don't much care about
the name of Ernest.

308
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,667
I don't think
it suits me at all.

309
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,420
It suits you perfectly.
It is a divine name.

310
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,755
It has a music of its own.

311
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:07,176
It produces vibrations.

312
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,470
Well, really, Gwendolen...

313
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,016
I must say I think there are
lots of other much nicer names.

314
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,267
I think...

315
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:19,897
Jack, for instance,
a charming name.

316
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,231
Jack?

317
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,400
I've known several Jacks,
and they all...

318
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,736
without exception,
were more than usually plain.

319
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:26,862
Mm.

320
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:30,407
The only really
safe name is Ernest.

321
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:33,285
Gwendolen, we must
get married at once.

322
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,456
Married, Mr. Worthing?

323
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:39,082
Well, surely.

324
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:43,212
You know that I love you,
and you led me to believe...

325
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:47,341
Miss Fairfax, that you were not
absolutely indifferent to me.

326
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:48,967
I adore you.

327
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,928
But you haven't
proposed to me yet.

328
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:53,138
Nothing's been said
at all about marriage.

329
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:56,183
The subject has not even
been touched on.

330
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,401
Gwendolen.

331
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,488
Yes, Mr. Worthing,
what have you to say to me?

332
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:11,907
You know what
I have to say to you.

333
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,576
Yes, but you don't say it.

334
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:21,959
Gwendolen, will you marry me?

335
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,671
Mr. Worthing!

336
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,006
Rise, sir, from this
semi-recumbent posture.

337
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,716
It is most indecorous.

338
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,177
Mama! I must beg you to retire.

339
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,971
Mr. Worthing has not
quite finished yet.

340
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,764
Finished what, may I ask?

341
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:39,059
I am engaged to be married
to Mr. Worthing, Mama.

342
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,562
Pardon me. Gwendolen.
You are not engaged to anyone.

343
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,355
When you do become
engaged to someone...

344
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:46,441
I or your father, should
his health permit him...

345
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:49,528
Will inform you of the fact.

346
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:52,531
You will wait for me
below in the carriage.

347
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:55,284
-Mama--
-In the carriage, Gwendolen.

348
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,047
Gwendolen! The carriage!

349
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,016
I feel bound to tell you,
Mr. Worthing...

350
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:22,477
you are not down on my list
of eligible young men.

351
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,313
However, I'm quite ready...

352
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:26,398
to enter your name
as a possible candidate.

353
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:29,318
Perhaps you would attend
a meeting at my house...

354
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,612
at eleven o'clock
tomorrow morning.

355
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:35,073
I shall have a few questions
to put to you.

356
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,535
Algernon?

357
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:43,123
So did you tell
Gwendolen the truth...

358
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:46,418
about being Ernest in town
and Jack in the country?

359
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:47,669
My dear fellow...

360
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,379
the truth isn't quite
the sort of thing...

361
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,423
one tells to
a nice, sweet, refined girl.

362
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:52,841
What extraordinary
ideas you have...

363
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,301
about the way to behave
to a woman.

364
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,802
The only way
to behave to a woman...

365
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,262
is to make love to her
if she's pretty...

366
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,847
and to someone else
if she is plain.

367
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,098
That is nonsense.

368
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,808
You never talk anything
but nonsense.

369
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,602
Well, nobody ever does.

370
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:06,730
Oh, my dear fellow,
you forgot to pay the bill.

371
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,234
Not at all. I make it a point
never to pay at the Savoy.

372
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:14,738
Why on earth not?
You have heaps of money.

373
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:16,949
Yes, but Ernest hasn't...

374
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:19,159
and he's got quite
a reputation to keep up.

375
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:30,504
Cecily?

376
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:34,341
More intellectual pleasures
await you, my child.

377
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:40,639
You should put away
your diary, Cecily.

378
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:43,851
I really don't see why
you should keep a diary at all.

379
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,394
I keep a diary
in order to enter...

380
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:47,646
the wonderful
secrets of my life.

381
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:48,981
If I didn't write them down...

382
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:51,358
I should probably
forget all about them.

383
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,985
Memory, my dear Cecily...

384
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:55,070
is the diary that we
all carry about with us.

385
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,947
I believe memory
is responsible...

386
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,907
for nearly all these
three-volume novels...

387
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,534
people write nowadays.

388
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:04,079
Do not speak slightingly of
the three-volume novel, Cecily.

389
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,707
I wrote one myself
in earlier days.

390
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:09,001
Did you really, Miss Prism?

391
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:11,044
I hope it did not end happily.

392
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:14,173
The good ended happily
and the bad unhappily.

393
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:16,383
That is what fiction means.

394
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,634
Hmm.

395
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:18,844
Do your work, child.

396
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:21,180
These speculations
are profitless.

397
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:25,058
But I see
dear Dr. Chasuble...

398
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,227
coming through the garden.

399
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,021
Oh, Dr. Chasuble!

400
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,193
This is indeed a pleasure.

401
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,028
And how are we today?

402
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:38,697
Miss Prism, you are,
I trust, well.

403
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:40,490
Miss Prism has just
been complaining...

404
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,493
of a slight headache.
I think it would do her...

405
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:44,328
so much good to have
a short stroll with you...

406
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:45,871
in the park, Dr. Chasuble.

407
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:49,166
Cecily! I have not mentioned
anything about a headache.

408
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,418
No dear Miss Prism.
I know that...

409
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,545
but I felt instinctively
that you had a headache.

410
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,130
Indeed, I was
thinking about that...

411
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,633
and not my German lesson
when the rector came along.

412
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,635
I hope, Cecily,
you are not inattentive.

413
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:03,013
-I am afraid I am.
-That's strange.

414
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,724
were I fortunate enough
to be Miss Prism's pupil...

415
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:08,185
I would hang upon her lips.

416
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:17,486
I spoke metaphorically.

417
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,279
Oh.

418
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:23,325
My metaphor
was drawn from...bees.

419
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:24,409
Oh...

420
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,536
Hmm.

421
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,456
Ahem I shall, um...

422
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:33,585
see you both, no doubt,
at Evensong.

423
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:01,530
Good luck, sir.

424
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,294
Ernest!

425
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,760
-This way, sir.
-Shall l, uh--

426
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:51,747
You can take a seat,
Mr. Worthing.

427
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,127
Thank you, Lady Bracknell.
I prefer standing.

428
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:08,555
Do you smoke?

429
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:15,938
Well, yes,
I must admit I smoke.

430
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,731
I'm glad to hear it.

431
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:20,567
A man should always have
an occupation of some kind.

432
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,028
There are far too many
idle men in London as it is.

433
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:28,450
-How old are you?
-Thirty-five.

434
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,702
A very good age
to be married at.

435
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:33,622
I've always been of opinion...

436
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:35,582
that a man who desires
to get married...

437
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,418
should know either
everything or nothing.

438
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,337
Which do you know?

439
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:44,967
I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.

440
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:46,802
I'm pleased to hear it.

441
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,472
I do not approve
of anything that tampers...

442
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,474
with natural ignorance.

443
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:56,186
Ignorance is like
a delicate, exotic fruit.

444
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:59,147
Touch it,
and the bloom is gone.

445
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:01,275
The whole theory
of modern education...

446
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:02,943
is radically unsound.

447
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,570
Fortunately, in England,
at any rate...

448
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,780
education produces
no effect whatsoever.

449
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,740
If it did it would prove
a serious danger...

450
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,534
to the upper classes
and probably lead...

451
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:13,662
to acts of violence
in Grosvenor Square.

452
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:17,124
-What is your income?
-Between 7 and 8,000 a year.

453
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:21,211
-In land or in investments?
-In investments, chiefly.

454
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:23,589
Oh, that is satisfactory.

455
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:27,593
I have a country house
with some land...

456
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:29,303
of course, attached to it.

457
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:30,888
About 1,500 acres, I believe.

458
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:32,806
You have a town house, I hope.

459
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:35,225
A girl with a simple, unspoiled
nature like Gwendolen...

460
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:38,103
could hardly be expected
to reside in the country.

461
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:40,480
Well, of course I also own
a house in Belgrave Square.

462
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,232
-Number?
-A hundred and forty-nine.

463
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:48,697
The unfashionable side.
I thought there was something.

464
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:56,705
However, that could
easily be altered.

465
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:59,500
Do you mean the fashion
or the side?

466
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,585
Well, both, if necessary,
I presume.

467
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,882
Are your parents living?

468
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:10,385
I have lost both my parents.

469
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:13,096
To lose one parent,
Mr. Worthing...

470
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:15,724
may be regarded
as a misfortune.

471
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:19,144
To lose both
looks like carelessness.

472
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:21,772
Who was your father?

473
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:24,149
He was evidently
a man of some wealth.

474
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:26,109
I'm afraid
I really don't know.

475
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:32,616
The fact is, Lady Bracknell,
I said I had lost my parents.

476
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,076
It would be nearer the truth...

477
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:36,119
to say my parents
seem to have lost me.

478
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:40,249
I actually don't know
who I am by birth.

479
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:43,919
I was--

480
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,255
Well, I was found.

481
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:47,881
Found?

482
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:50,175
The late Mr. Thomas Cardew,
an old gentleman...

483
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:52,219
of a very charitable
and kindly disposition...

484
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,596
found me and gave me
the name of Worthing...

485
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:56,515
because he happened to have
a first-class ticket...

486
00:25:56,515 --> 00:25:58,267
for Worthing
in his pocket at the time.

487
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:03,647
Worthing is a place in Sussex.
It is a seaside resort.

488
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:05,732
And where did this
charitable gentlemen...

489
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,860
with a first-class ticket
for the seaside resort...

490
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,236
find you?

491
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:11,947
In a handbag.

492
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:19,037
-A handbag?
-Yes, Lady Bracknell.

493
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:21,748
I was in a handbag--

494
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:29,214
a somewhat large, um,
black leather handbag...

495
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:31,383
with handles to it.

496
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:35,971
An ordinary handbag, in fact.

497
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:41,727
In what locality did this
Mr. James or Thomas Cardew...

498
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:44,021
come across this
ordinary handbag?

499
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:46,356
In the cloakroom
at Victoria Station.

500
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:48,442
It was given him
in mistake for his own.

501
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:51,069
The cloakroom
at Victoria Station?

502
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:52,946
Yes. The Brighton line.

503
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:55,532
The line is immaterial.

504
00:26:58,202 --> 00:27:00,787
Mr. Worthing, I confess
I am somewhat bewildered...

505
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,915
by what you have just told me.

506
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:06,043
To be born or at any rate
bred in a handbag...

507
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:07,961
whether it has handles or not...

508
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:10,047
seems to me
to display a contempt...

509
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:12,341
for the ordinary decencies
of family life...

510
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:14,593
which remind one
of the worst excesses...

511
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:16,261
of the French Revolution.

512
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:17,763
And I presume you know...

513
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:20,224
what that unfortunate
movement led to.

514
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:22,059
May I ask you then...

515
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:23,936
what you would
advise me to do?

516
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:26,063
I need hardly say
I would do anything...

517
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:27,689
in the world to ensure
Gwendolen's happiness.

518
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:30,192
I would strongly advise you,
Mr. Worthing...

519
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:32,694
to try and acquire some
relations as soon as possible...

520
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:36,198
and to make a definite effort
to produce at any rate...

521
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:39,785
one parent of either sex
before the season is quite over.

522
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:41,829
I don't see how I could
possibly manage to do that.

523
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:43,747
I can produce the handbag
at any moment.

524
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,582
It's in my storeroom at home.

525
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:47,960
I really think that should
satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.

526
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,461
Me, sir?

527
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:52,881
What has it to do with me?

528
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:55,425
You can hardly imagine
that I and Lord Bracknell...

529
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,262
would dream of allowing
our only daughter--

530
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:00,681
a girl brought up
with the utmost care--

531
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:02,516
to marry into a cloakroom...

532
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:06,103
and form an alliance
with a parcel.

533
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:12,234
Good morning, Mr. Worthing.

534
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:16,113
Good morning.

535
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:23,912
You don't think there's any
chance of Gwendolen becoming...

536
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:26,623
Iike her mother in about
1 50 years, do you, Algy?

537
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:28,458
My dear fellow,
all women become...

538
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,502
like their mothers.
That is their tragedy.

539
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:32,671
No man does, and that's his.

540
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:34,673
Is that clever?

541
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:36,842
It's perfectly
phrased and about as true...

542
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:39,553
as any observation in
civilized life should be.

543
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:41,096
Ernest.

544
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:43,682
-Gwendolen!
-Ernest, my dear Ernest.

545
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:45,058
Algy, please,
I have something...

546
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:47,269
very particular
to say to Mr. Worthing.

547
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:50,063
My own darling.

548
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:52,816
Ernest, the story
of your romantic origin...

549
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:55,986
as related to me by Mama with
unpleasing comments...

550
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:59,072
has naturally stirred
the deeper fibers of my nature.

551
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:01,200
I followed you here
to reassure you...

552
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,535
that there is nothing
that she can possibly do...

553
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:06,079
can alter my eternal
devotion to you.

554
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,706
Dear Gwendolen.

555
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:11,001
Your town address
at The Albany I have.

556
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:14,338
What is your address
in the country?

557
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:21,261
The Manor Woolton.
Hertfordshire.

558
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:23,347
I will communicate
with you daily.

559
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:24,640
My own one.

560
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:26,934
Oh!

561
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:31,146
Yes. I must confess.
I do smoke.

562
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:33,774
I know nothing Lady Bracknell.

563
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:40,405
I can produce the handbag
at a moment's notice.

564
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:42,324
Shh! Shh.

565
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:43,909
Before you can be found...

566
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:45,619
in a handbag
at a railway station...

567
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:47,371
someone must have lost you
in a handbag...

568
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:49,039
at a railway station.
Do you see?

569
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:56,964
In the first place,
what with Lady Bracknell...

570
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:59,132
sniffing about,
dear, dissolute Ernest...

571
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:01,260
is a risk
I can no longer afford.

572
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,720
And secondly, Cecily
is becoming a little too much...

573
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,764
interested in him.
It's rather a bore.

574
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:07,599
I'd rather like to meet Cecily.

575
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,644
Well I shall take
very good care you never do.

576
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:14,481
She is excessively pretty
and only just eighteen.

577
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:20,445
No, I'll say he died
in Paris of apoplexy.

578
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:22,197
But it's hereditary,
my dear fellow.

579
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:24,158
It's the sort of thing
that runs in families.

580
00:30:24,158 --> 00:30:25,701
You had much better say
it was a severe chill.

581
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:27,452
Very well then.

582
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:30,289
Poor brother Ernest
is carried off suddenly...

583
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:34,710
in Paris by a severe chill.

584
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,628
That gets rid of him.

585
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:41,133
Have you told Gwendolen
that you have...

586
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:44,428
an excessively pretty ward
who's only just eighteen?

587
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:47,055
No. One doesn't blurt
these things out to people.

588
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:49,558
Cecily and Gwendolen
are perfectly certain...

589
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:51,560
to become extremely
great friends.

590
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,229
I bet you anything half
an hour after they've met...

591
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:55,814
they will be calling
each other sister.

592
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:58,442
Women only
do that when they have...

593
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:01,862
called each other a lot
of other things first.

594
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,812
Don't let me
disturb you.

595
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,068
I hope tomorrow
will be a fine day, Lane.

596
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:43,153
It never is, sir.

597
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:47,699
You are a perfect pessimist.

598
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:50,786
I do my best to give
satisfaction, sir.

599
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:52,162
Thank you.

600
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:01,213
You can put out
my dress clothes...

601
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:03,048
my smoking jacket...

602
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:06,468
and even bring on
the curling tongs.

603
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:08,053
Yes, sir.

604
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:09,555
Tomorrow, Lane...

605
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,517
I'm going Bunburying.

606
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,894
Yes sir.

607
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,405
That must be it over there.

608
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:35,122
Bring it down there,
Mr. Smithers.

609
00:32:57,227 --> 00:32:59,271
Ask Mr. Ernest Worthing
to come here.

610
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:00,689
Yes Miss.

611
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:16,121
You are my little cousin
Cecily, I'm sure.

612
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:18,415
You are under
some strange mistake.

613
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:21,126
I'm not little.
In fact, I believe...

614
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:22,961
I'm more than usually
tall for my age.

615
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:25,339
But I am your cousin Cecily.

616
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:29,468
And you--you,
I see from your card...

617
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:31,845
are Uncle Jack's brother,
my cousin Ernest.

618
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:34,473
My wicked cousin Ernest.

619
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:36,225
I'm not really wicked
at all, Cousin Cecily.

620
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:38,018
You mustn't think
that I'm wicked.

621
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:39,770
Well, if you are not,
then you've certainly...

622
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,439
been deceiving us all
in a very inexcusable manner.

623
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:44,399
Well, I have been
rather reckless.

624
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,692
Hmm, I'm glad to hear it.

625
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:47,486
In fact, now that
you mention the subject...

626
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:50,614
I have been very bad
in my own small way.

627
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:52,825
Well, I don't think you should
be so proud of that...

628
00:33:52,825 --> 00:33:54,785
though I am sure
it must've been very pleasant.

629
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:56,453
It's much pleasanter
being here with you.

630
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:58,497
I can't understand
how you're here at all.

631
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:00,582
Uncle Jack won't be back
till Monday afternoon.

632
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:02,501
Oh, that is a great
disappointment.

633
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:03,961
I'm obliged to go out...

634
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:05,462
by the first train
on Monday morning.

635
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:08,465
I have a business appointment
that I'm anxious to miss.

636
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:11,677
Hmm. That's all very well,
but still...

637
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:14,429
I think you had better wait
until Uncle Jack arrives.

638
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:17,057
I know he wants to speak to you
about your emigrating.

639
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:18,308
About my what?

640
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:20,060
Uncle Jack is sending you
to Australia.

641
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,646
Australia? I'd sooner die.

642
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:24,523
He said at dinner
on Wednesday night...

643
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:26,608
that you would have to choose
between this world...

644
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:28,402
the next world, and Australia.

645
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:29,778
Oh, well.

646
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:32,030
The accounts I have
received of Australia...

647
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,907
and the next world
are not particularly...

648
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:35,909
encouraging, Cousin Cecily.

649
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:38,120
This world
is good enough for me.

650
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,955
Yes, but are you
good enough for it?

651
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:41,498
No, I'm afraid not.

652
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:43,876
That is why I want you
to reform me.

653
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:45,627
You might make that
your mission...

654
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:47,004
if you don't mind,
Cousin Cecily.

655
00:34:47,004 --> 00:34:49,423
I'm afraid I've no time
this afternoon.

656
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:51,383
Well, would you mind me...

657
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:53,635
reforming myself
this afternoon?

658
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:01,226
It is rather quixotic of you,
but I think you should try.

659
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:03,353
I will.

660
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:08,317
-I feel better already.
-You're looking a little worse.

661
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:10,235
well,
that's because I'm hungry.

662
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:19,411
-Mr. Worthing!
-Mr. Worthing!

663
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,123
This is indeed a surprise.

664
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:25,584
We did not look for you
till Monday afternoon.

665
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:28,378
I have returned
sooner than I expected.

666
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:30,964
Dear Mr. Worthing,
I trust this garb of woe...

667
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:33,634
does not betoken
some terrible calamity.

668
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:35,719
My brother.

669
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:38,263
More shameful debts
and extravagance.

670
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:41,141
Still leading
a life of pleasure.

671
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:43,101
Dead.

672
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:50,359
Your brother Ernest is dead?

673
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:51,902
Quite dead.

674
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:56,114
What a lesson for him!
I trust he will profit by it.

675
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:59,326
He had many faults,
but it is a sad, sad blow.

676
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:01,119
Yes indeed sad.

677
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:07,918
Um, were you with him
at the end?

678
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:12,130
No. He died abroad.
In Paris, in fact.

679
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,883
I had a telegram last night...

680
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:17,636
from the manager
of the Grand Hotel.

681
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:20,931
Is the cause of death
mentioned?

682
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:23,058
A severe chill, it seems.

683
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:26,311
As a man sows,
so shall he reap.

684
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:28,063
Oh, charity,
Miss Prism, charity.

685
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:31,942
I myself am peculiarly
susceptible to draft.

686
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:37,030
Ah...ah...Ah-choo!

687
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,907
Bless you.

688
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:43,871
Uncle Jack, I'm so pleased
to see you back.

689
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:47,291
What is the matter, Uncle Jack?
Do look happy.

690
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:48,959
You look as if
you had toothache...

691
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:50,460
and I have such
a surprise for you.

692
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,504
Who do you think
is in the rose garden?

693
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:55,215
Your brother.

694
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:58,343
-Who?
-Your brother Ernest.

695
00:36:58,343 --> 00:37:00,304
He arrived about
half an hour ago.

696
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:02,431
Nonsense.
I haven't got a brother.

697
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:03,849
-I mean...
-Well, he's...

698
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:07,394
Come, he'll be so pleased
to see you've returned so soon.

699
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:10,856
I--

700
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,611
These are joyful tidings.

701
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:33,712
Good heavens.

702
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:38,217
Mmm.

703
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:57,402
Brother John,
I've come down from town...

704
00:37:57,402 --> 00:37:59,238
to tell you
that I'm very sorry...

705
00:37:59,238 --> 00:38:00,989
for all the trouble
I have given you...

706
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:02,533
and that I fully intend...

707
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:04,618
to lead a better life
in the future.

708
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:16,338
Well, what can I say?

709
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:19,925
The old Ernest is dead.
Long live the new Ernest.

710
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:22,094
I thought you'd like
my little joke.

711
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:23,470
Your little joke?

712
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,472
Knowing me as you do,
brother John...

713
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:26,932
I'm surprised
you took it so seriously.

714
00:38:26,932 --> 00:38:29,434
At any rate,
I stand before you now...

715
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:32,938
an entirely new man,
risen, as it were...

716
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:34,982
Like a phoenix from the ashes.

717
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:39,820
Uncle Jack,
you're not going to refuse...

718
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,071
your own brother's hand.

719
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:42,698
Nothing would induce me
to take his hand.

720
00:38:42,698 --> 00:38:44,116
I think his behavior
utterly disgraceful.

721
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:46,326
He knows perfectly well why!

722
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:48,745
Do shake his hand, Uncle Jack.

723
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:53,417
After all, it could be worse.
I could be dead in Paris.

724
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:55,002
You could, indeed.

725
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,795
Of a severe chill.

726
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:00,966
Ah-choo!

727
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:07,472
Sorry about that, Jack.
Shake. Go on.

728
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:09,474
Ha ha!

729
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:13,937
Excuse me, sir.

730
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:16,523
We're putting
Mr. Ernest's things...

731
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:18,275
in the blue room
on the second floor.

732
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:20,569
Very nice to see you, Doctor.
Do tell me, when is confession?

733
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:21,737
What?

734
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:23,489
Mr. Ernest's luggage, sir.

735
00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:25,532
We're taking it up
to the blue room.

736
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:27,826
-His luggage?
-Yes, sir.

737
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:29,745
Two portmanteaus,
two dressing cases...

738
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:32,456
two hat boxes,
and a large luncheon basket.

739
00:39:32,456 --> 00:39:34,625
I fear I can only
stay a week this time.

740
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,253
Heh heh.

741
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:41,256
-You scoundrel, Algy.
-Mm?

742
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:43,800
What have you
to say for yourself?

743
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,552
What I have to say,
Uncle Jack...

744
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:48,305
is that little Cecily
is a darling.

745
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:52,434
You are not to talk
of Miss Cardew like that!

746
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:54,811
I don't like it.

747
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:56,396
Your vanity is ridiculous...

748
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:58,482
your conduct an outrage,
and your presence...

749
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:00,359
in my house utterly absurd!

750
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:04,071
However, you have got
to catch the four-five train.

751
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:05,781
I hope you have a pleasant
journey back to town.

752
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:08,367
This Bunburying,
as you call it...

753
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:11,036
has not been
a great success for you.

754
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:29,638
CHASUBLE:
It's pleasant is it not...

755
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:32,349
to see so perfect
a reconciliation.

756
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:38,355
I think
it's been a great success.

757
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:56,874
Huh?

758
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:22,941
Ahem.

759
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:43,045
Dinner is served.

760
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:44,630
Cecily.

761
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,591
Might I have a buttonhole first?

762
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:50,427
I never have an appetite
unless I have a buttonhole.

763
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:52,095
Mr. Worthing.

764
00:41:56,225 --> 00:41:58,352
-Marigold?
-No.

765
00:41:58,352 --> 00:42:00,312
I'd sooner have
a pink rose.

766
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:01,522
Why?

767
00:42:01,522 --> 00:42:04,817
Because you are like
a pink rose, Cousin Cecily.

768
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:06,235
I don't think
it could be right...

769
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:07,528
for you to talk to me
like that.

770
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:09,988
Miss Prism never says
such things to me.

771
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:12,699
Then Miss Prism
is a short-sighted old lady.

772
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:18,622
You are the prettiest girl
I ever saw.

773
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:24,211
You see, Uncle Jack,
there is some good in everyone.

774
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:27,005
Ernest has just been telling me
about his poor invalid friend...

775
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:28,590
Whom he goes to visit so often.

776
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,343
Oh, he has been talking about
poor Mr. Bunbury, has he?

777
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:32,845
And surely there
must be much good...

778
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:34,388
in one who is kind
to an invalid...

779
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:36,014
and leaves the pleasures
of London...

780
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:38,725
to sit by a bed of pain.

781
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:40,477
Hmm.

782
00:43:19,183 --> 00:43:20,726
Right. It's first class.

783
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:43,749
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

784
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:04,478
Dear Ernest...

785
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:07,564
how desperately
I have missed you.

786
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:10,609
It seems an age
since I last saw you...

787
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:15,239
and our separation is now
proving an intolerable strain.

788
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:27,626
The feelings
you have aroused within me...

789
00:44:27,626 --> 00:44:31,463
are at once delightful
and exquisitely...

790
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:33,173
painful.

791
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:37,886
My dearest darling Ernest...

792
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:40,973
it is your very name
that inspires me now...

793
00:44:40,973 --> 00:44:42,850
to take my future
in my hands--

794
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:48,313
burnt as it were.
into my very being.

795
00:44:48,313 --> 00:44:51,984
And so it is. I have resolved
to flee these prison walls...

796
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:55,404
and make my way
directly to your side...

797
00:44:55,404 --> 00:44:58,323
to my one and only...

798
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:00,993
Ernest.

799
00:45:00,993 --> 00:45:02,536
Ernest.

800
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:08,500
Algy.

801
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,669
Hmm.

802
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:16,758
Algy.

803
00:45:19,511 --> 00:45:21,138
Ernest.

804
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:25,851
Ah. Good morning,
my dear fellow.

805
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:29,521
We have to talk.
You have to leave.

806
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:31,190
If I leave, how can we talk?

807
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,025
We can not both be called Ernest.

808
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:34,860
I don't believe we are,
Brother Jack.

809
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:48,081
I believe you are praiseworthy.

810
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:51,126
He, she, it praises.

811
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:54,880
Mmm.

812
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,049
You're snoring?

813
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,558
I hope, Cecily,
I shall not offend you...

814
00:46:06,558 --> 00:46:10,812
if I state
quite openly and frankly...

815
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:12,397
Unh.

816
00:46:12,397 --> 00:46:14,733
You seem to me
to be in every way...

817
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:20,572
the visible personification
of absolute perfection.

818
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:23,242
I think your frankness
does you great credit, Ernest.

819
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:26,203
If you will allow me, I will
copy your remarks into my diary.

820
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:29,122
Do you keep a diary?
I'd give anything to see it.

821
00:46:29,122 --> 00:46:32,334
Oh, no. You'd see it as simply
a very young girl's record...

822
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:34,086
of her own thoughts
and impressions.

823
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:37,464
But, pray, Ernest, I delight
in taking down from dictation.

824
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:39,424
You can go on.

825
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:44,137
Don't cough, Ernest.
When one is dictating...

826
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:46,390
one should speak fluently
and not cough.

827
00:46:52,855 --> 00:46:55,607
Cecily, ever since
I first looked upon...

828
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:57,943
your wondrous
and incomparable beauty...

829
00:46:57,943 --> 00:47:00,988
I have dared to love you--
Wildly...

830
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:04,992
Wildly...

831
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:06,660
-passionately...
-Ahem.

832
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,621
devotedly, hopelessly.

833
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:12,291
I beg your pardon, sir.

834
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:15,085
There are two gentlemen
wishing to see you.

835
00:47:27,598 --> 00:47:29,308
-Mr. Ernest Worthing?
-Yes.

836
00:47:29,308 --> 00:47:32,561
-Of B.4, The Albany?
-Yes, that is my address.

837
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:33,937
I am very sorry sir...

838
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:35,772
but I have a writ
of attachment against you...

839
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:38,442
and the suit of the Savoy
Hotel Company Limited...

840
00:47:38,442 --> 00:47:41,195
for 762 pounds, 14 shillings.

841
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:42,738
What perfect nonsense.

842
00:47:42,738 --> 00:47:44,948
I never dine at the Savoy
at my own expense.

843
00:47:44,948 --> 00:47:46,825
In the interests
of our clients...

844
00:47:46,825 --> 00:47:48,744
We have no option
but to take out an order...

845
00:47:48,744 --> 00:47:50,579
for committal of your person.

846
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:54,041
-Committal? Of my person?
-For six months.

847
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:56,210
Oh, for six months?
Ha ha!

848
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,669
No doubt
you'll prefer to pay the bill.

849
00:47:57,669 --> 00:48:00,380
Pay it? How on earth
am I going to do that?

850
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,299
No gentleman
ever has any money.

851
00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:06,512
In my experience,
it is usually relations who pay.

852
00:48:06,512 --> 00:48:08,805
Oh, all right.
Uh, Brother Jack?

853
00:48:16,814 --> 00:48:21,485
762 pounds, 14 shillings,
and a tuppence--

854
00:48:21,485 --> 00:48:23,487
since last October.

855
00:48:23,487 --> 00:48:25,155
I'm bound to say...

856
00:48:25,155 --> 00:48:30,202
I never saw such reckless
extravagance in all my life.

857
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:33,247
My dear fellow,
how ridiculous you are.

858
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:36,041
You have your debts,
and I have mine.

859
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:37,918
You know quite well
this bill is really yours.

860
00:48:37,918 --> 00:48:39,336
-Mine?
-Yes, and you know it.

861
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:40,712
-Mr. Worthing...
-Huh.

862
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:43,757
if this is another jest,
it is most out of place.

863
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:45,592
-It is not.
-It is gross effrontery.

864
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:47,177
Just what I expected from him.

865
00:48:47,177 --> 00:48:50,264
And it is ingratitude.
I didn't expect that.

866
00:48:50,264 --> 00:48:51,682
Next thing you know.
he'll be denying...

867
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:54,393
he's Ernest Worthing
in the first place.

868
00:48:56,353 --> 00:48:59,106
I'm sorry to disturb this
so pleasant family meeting...

869
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:00,566
but time presses.

870
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:02,651
We have to be at Holloway
not later than four o'clock.

871
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:04,570
Otherwise, it is difficult
to obtain admission.

872
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:06,822
The rules are very strict.

873
00:49:06,822 --> 00:49:10,033
Holloway? But--Get off me!

874
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:11,410
It is at Holloway that
detentions of this character...

875
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:13,162
are made away.

876
00:49:13,162 --> 00:49:17,708
I will not be imprisoned for
having dined in the West End!

877
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,543
Jack!

878
00:49:20,878 --> 00:49:22,754
I agree to settle
my brother's accounts...

879
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:27,593
on the condition that he makes
his way without delay...

880
00:49:27,593 --> 00:49:29,761
to the bedside of
the poor bed-ridden Bunbury...

881
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:31,388
whose health,
I have recently been informed...

882
00:49:31,388 --> 00:49:33,390
is rapidly declining.

883
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:38,187
Well, Ernest?

884
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:19,269
...it's only life.

885
00:50:21,814 --> 00:50:23,857
Mr. Worthing.

886
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:25,692
I Would ask you
not to interrupt...

887
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:27,486
Miss Cardew's studies.

888
00:50:27,486 --> 00:50:29,279
Miss Prism,
I almost forgot to mention...

889
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:31,824
that Dr. Chasuble
is expecting you in the vestry.

890
00:50:31,824 --> 00:50:34,451
In the vestry? Dr. Chasuble?

891
00:50:34,451 --> 00:50:36,328
Expecting you, yes.

892
00:50:36,328 --> 00:50:38,288
That sounds serious.

893
00:50:38,288 --> 00:50:41,500
I do not think it would be right
to keep him waiting, Cecily.

894
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,252
It would be very, very wrong.

895
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:46,505
The vestry is, I am told,
excessively damp.

896
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:03,730
This parting, Miss Cardew,
is very painful.

897
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,149
But I suppose
you cannot desert...

898
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:07,025
poor Mr. Bunbury
in his hour of need.

899
00:51:07,025 --> 00:51:08,360
I don't care
about Bunbury anymore.

900
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:12,072
I don't seem to care
about anything anymore.

901
00:51:12,072 --> 00:51:15,492
I only care for you.
I love you, Cecily.

902
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,417
Will you marry me, Cecily?
Will you?

903
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:25,377
Of course.

904
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:28,213
Why, we have been engaged
for the last three months.

905
00:51:29,715 --> 00:51:32,217
For the last three months?

906
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:34,887
Yes. It will be exactly
three months on Thursday.

907
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:37,598
Darling...

908
00:51:37,598 --> 00:51:38,849
Aah!

909
00:51:41,894 --> 00:51:46,398
So, when was the engagement
actually settled?

910
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:48,901
On the fourteenth
of February last.

911
00:51:48,901 --> 00:51:50,444
After a long struggle
with myself...

912
00:51:50,444 --> 00:51:53,071
I accepted you
under this dear old tree here.

913
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:57,242
And this is the box in which
I keep all your dear letters.

914
00:51:57,242 --> 00:51:58,660
My letters?

915
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,913
But my own sweet Cecily, I have
never written you any letters.

916
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:03,207
You need hardly
remind me of that, Ernest.

917
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:04,374
I remember only too well...

918
00:52:04,374 --> 00:52:06,210
that I was forced
to write your letters for you.

919
00:52:07,544 --> 00:52:09,880
I wrote always three times
a week and sometimes oftener.

920
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,633
-Do let me look at them.
-Oh, no, I couldn't possibly.

921
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:15,761
They would make you
far too conceited.

922
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:18,263
The three you wrote after I had
broken off the engagement...

923
00:52:18,263 --> 00:52:21,266
were so beautiful
and so badly spelled.

924
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:23,977
Even now I can hardly read them
without crying a little.

925
00:52:23,977 --> 00:52:25,938
Was our engagement
ever broken off?

926
00:52:25,938 --> 00:52:28,023
-Yes, of course it was.
-What?

927
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:29,608
On the twenty-second
of last March.

928
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:31,944
You can see the entry
if you like.

929
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:37,282
"Today I broke off
my engagement with Ernest.

930
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:38,867
"The weather
still continues charming."

931
00:52:38,867 --> 00:52:40,244
Why on earth
did you break it off?

932
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:42,204
What had I done?
I had done nothing at all.

933
00:52:42,204 --> 00:52:44,665
I'm very much hurt indeed
to hear you broke it off.

934
00:52:44,665 --> 00:52:46,458
Particularly when
the weather was so charming.

935
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:49,878
Well, it would hardly have been
a really serious engagement...

936
00:52:49,878 --> 00:52:52,840
if I hadn't broken it off
at least once, Ernest.

937
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,801
But I forgave you
before the week was out.

938
00:52:55,801 --> 00:52:58,554
Oh, you're a perfect angel.

939
00:52:58,554 --> 00:53:01,765
-You dear romantic boy.
-Mmm.

940
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:25,873
You know, I never really
thought of myself...

941
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:28,208
as the marrying kind until now.

942
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:30,627
You mustn't break it off
again, Cecily.

943
00:53:30,627 --> 00:53:32,588
Well, I don't think
I could break it off...

944
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:34,298
now that I've actually met you.

945
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:36,633
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

946
00:53:36,633 --> 00:53:39,511
Besides, of course, there is
the question of your name.

947
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,015
Yes, of course.

948
00:53:43,015 --> 00:53:44,433
You mustn't laugh at me,
darling...

949
00:53:44,433 --> 00:53:46,768
but it has always been
a girlish dream of mine...

950
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:49,354
to love someone
whose name is Ernest.

951
00:53:49,354 --> 00:53:50,522
Hmm.

952
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:51,815
There's something
in that name...

953
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:55,194
that seems to inspire
absolute confidence.

954
00:53:55,194 --> 00:53:57,863
My own dear joy, do you mean
to say you couldn't love me...

955
00:53:57,863 --> 00:53:59,323
if I had another name?

956
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:03,035
-But what name?
-Well...

957
00:54:03,035 --> 00:54:05,913
Algy, for instance.

958
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:08,207
I might respect you, Ernest...

959
00:54:08,207 --> 00:54:11,210
I might admire
your character...

960
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:13,212
but I fear that I would
never be able to give you...

961
00:54:13,212 --> 00:54:16,423
my undivided attention.

962
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:19,301
Mmm. Mmm.

963
00:54:19,301 --> 00:54:21,220
Ahem.

964
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:24,765
The dog cart
is ready for you, sir.

965
00:54:24,765 --> 00:54:26,016
-Ahem.
-Ahem.

966
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:27,184
And now you must go, my love...

967
00:54:27,184 --> 00:54:28,852
for sooner then
shall you return.

968
00:54:33,232 --> 00:54:36,610
Oh, what a charming boy.

969
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:38,946
I like his hair so much.

970
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:49,540
You wanted to see me,
Dr. Chasuble?

971
00:54:52,751 --> 00:54:54,336
I didn't.

972
00:54:56,088 --> 00:54:58,006
Oh.

973
00:54:58,006 --> 00:54:59,258
You didn't?

974
00:55:01,927 --> 00:55:03,846
Oh.

975
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:10,477
I'm sorry...

976
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:13,147
but merely for
the purposes of clarification...

977
00:55:13,147 --> 00:55:15,107
when you said you didn't...

978
00:55:15,107 --> 00:55:18,777
did you mean you didn't say
you wanted to see me...

979
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:22,114
or that you didn't, in fact,
want to see me?

980
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:29,788
Isn't language a curious thing?

981
00:55:31,623 --> 00:55:32,791
Will you excuse me?

982
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:35,210
I have a double baptism
this afternoon...

983
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:37,921
and I have to top up the font.

984
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:11,121
Bless you.

985
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:16,752
A Miss Fairfax has called
to see Mr. Worthing--

986
00:56:16,752 --> 00:56:20,297
on very important business,
Miss Fairfax states.

987
00:56:20,297 --> 00:56:22,216
Mr. Worthing is sure
to be out soon, Merriman...

988
00:56:22,216 --> 00:56:23,967
so kindly bring some tea.

989
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:25,219
Yes, miss.

990
00:56:29,306 --> 00:56:31,517
-Miss Cardew.
-Thank you.

991
00:56:31,517 --> 00:56:35,187
Miss Fairfax, pray let me
introduce myself to you.

992
00:56:35,187 --> 00:56:36,355
My name is Cecily Cardew.

993
00:56:36,355 --> 00:56:39,942
Cecily Cardew.
What a very sweet name.

994
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:42,444
Something tells me
we're going to be great friends.

995
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:44,446
I like you already
more than I can say...

996
00:56:44,446 --> 00:56:46,990
and my first impressions
of people are never wrong.

997
00:56:57,709 --> 00:56:59,670
You're here on a short visit,
I suppose.

998
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,713
-Oh, no, I live here.
-Really?

999
00:57:01,713 --> 00:57:04,633
Your mother, no doubt,
or some female relative...

1000
00:57:04,633 --> 00:57:07,177
of advanced years
resides here also.

1001
00:57:07,177 --> 00:57:09,555
Oh, no. I have no mother,
nor, in fact, any relations.

1002
00:57:09,555 --> 00:57:10,931
-Indeed.
-My dear guardian...

1003
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:12,724
has the arduous task
of looking after me.

1004
00:57:12,724 --> 00:57:16,478
-Your guardian?
-I'm Mr. Worthing's ward.

1005
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:18,188
Oh.

1006
00:57:19,606 --> 00:57:22,860
It is strange.
He never mentioned it.

1007
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,154
How secretive of him.
Ha ha ha!

1008
00:57:25,154 --> 00:57:28,574
He grows
more interesting hourly.

1009
00:57:28,574 --> 00:57:31,910
But I am bound to state that...

1010
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:34,580
now that I know
you are Mr. Worthing's ward...

1011
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:37,249
I cannot help expressing
a wish that you were...

1012
00:57:37,249 --> 00:57:40,961
well, just a little bit older
than you seem to be...

1013
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:43,380
and not quite so very alluring
in appearance.

1014
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,548
Hmm.

1015
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:46,967
In fact,
if I may speak candidly...

1016
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:48,552
Pray do.
I think whenever one...

1017
00:57:48,552 --> 00:57:50,095
has anything unpleasant
to say...

1018
00:57:50,095 --> 00:57:52,264
one should always be
quite candid.

1019
00:57:52,264 --> 00:57:56,643
Yes well, to speak
with perfect candor, Cecily...

1020
00:57:56,643 --> 00:57:58,729
I wish
you were fully forty-two...

1021
00:57:58,729 --> 00:58:01,732
and more than usually plain
for your age.

1022
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:07,779
Ernest has
a strong upright nature.

1023
00:58:07,779 --> 00:58:09,865
He's the very soul
of truth and honor.

1024
00:58:09,865 --> 00:58:11,658
I think--I think Jack,
for instance.

1025
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:15,412
Jack. I think Jack,
for instance, a charming name.

1026
00:58:15,412 --> 00:58:17,247
Oh but it is not
Mr. Ernest Worthing...

1027
00:58:17,247 --> 00:58:18,499
who's my guardian.

1028
00:58:18,499 --> 00:58:20,834
It is his brother,
his elder brother.

1029
00:58:20,834 --> 00:58:23,253
Oh. That accounts for it.

1030
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:26,298
Cecily, you've lifted a load
from my mind.

1031
00:58:26,298 --> 00:58:28,091
I was growing almost anxious.

1032
00:58:29,927 --> 00:58:31,386
Of course, you're quite sure...

1033
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:34,097
it's not Mr. Ernest Worthing
who is your guardian?

1034
00:58:34,097 --> 00:58:36,642
Quite sure.

1035
00:58:36,642 --> 00:58:38,435
In fact...

1036
00:58:39,853 --> 00:58:42,564
I am going to be his.

1037
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:45,776
I beg your pardon?

1038
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:49,655
Mr. Ernest Worthing and l
are engaged to be married.

1039
00:58:49,655 --> 00:58:51,323
Oh.

1040
00:58:52,616 --> 00:58:56,328
My darling Cecily, I think
there must be some slight error.

1041
00:58:56,328 --> 00:58:59,498
Mr. Ernest Worthing
is engaged to me.

1042
00:58:59,498 --> 00:59:01,416
The announcement will appear
in the Morning Post...

1043
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:03,877
on Saturday at the latest.

1044
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:06,964
I'm afraid you must be
under some misconception.

1045
00:59:06,964 --> 00:59:09,341
Ernest proposed to me
exactly ten minutes ago.

1046
00:59:09,341 --> 00:59:12,970
Oh, it's very curious, for
he asked me to be his wife...

1047
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:15,973
yesterday afternoon
at five thirty.

1048
00:59:15,973 --> 00:59:20,144
If you would care to verify
the incident, pray do so.

1049
00:59:21,728 --> 00:59:23,480
I never travel
without my diary.

1050
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,691
One should always have
something sensational to read...

1051
00:59:25,691 --> 00:59:27,151
in the train.

1052
00:59:27,151 --> 00:59:29,570
I'm so sorry, dear Cecily...

1053
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:32,156
but I'm afraid
I have the prior claim.

1054
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:01,518
Ow! Uhh.

1055
01:00:04,605 --> 01:00:06,899
May I offer you some tea,
Miss Fairfax?

1056
01:00:06,899 --> 01:00:08,942
Thank you, Miss Cardew.

1057
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:10,694
Sugar?

1058
01:00:10,694 --> 01:00:13,697
No, thank you Sugar
is not fashionable anymore.

1059
01:00:32,591 --> 01:00:34,426
Cake or bread and butter?

1060
01:00:34,426 --> 01:00:35,761
Bread and butter, please.

1061
01:00:35,761 --> 01:00:38,722
Cake is rarely seen
in the best houses nowadays.

1062
01:00:47,523 --> 01:00:49,233
Hmm?

1063
01:00:53,654 --> 01:00:55,781
From the moment I saw you,
I distrusted you.

1064
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:57,991
I felt that you were
false and deceitful.

1065
01:00:57,991 --> 01:01:00,619
It seems to me, Miss Fairfax...

1066
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:03,080
that I am trespassing
on your valuable time.

1067
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,498
No doubt,
you have many other calls...

1068
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:06,959
of a similar character
to make in the neighborhood.

1069
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,753
Ernest.

1070
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:17,719
-You're back so soon.
-My own love.

1071
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:18,929
A moment, Ernest.

1072
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:20,305
May I ask you--

1073
01:01:20,305 --> 01:01:22,474
are you engaged to be married
to this young lady?

1074
01:01:22,474 --> 01:01:23,767
What young lady?

1075
01:01:25,185 --> 01:01:26,812
Good heavens, Gwendolen.

1076
01:01:26,812 --> 01:01:28,355
Yes to
"Good heavens Gwendolen. "

1077
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:30,357
Of course not.
What put such an idea...

1078
01:01:30,357 --> 01:01:31,525
into your pretty little head?

1079
01:01:31,525 --> 01:01:33,485
Thank you. You may.

1080
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:35,863
I felt there must be
some slight error, Miss Cardew.

1081
01:01:35,863 --> 01:01:37,531
The gentleman
who is now embracing you...

1082
01:01:37,531 --> 01:01:41,326
is my cousin
Mr. Algernon Moncrieff.

1083
01:01:41,326 --> 01:01:44,746
Algernon? Moncrieff?

1084
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:46,790
-Uhh...
-Yes.

1085
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,834
Algy.

1086
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:50,502
Ohh!

1087
01:01:50,502 --> 01:01:52,504
Here is Ernest.

1088
01:01:52,504 --> 01:01:54,006
Ohh.

1089
01:01:54,006 --> 01:01:55,465
Oh my own Ernest.

1090
01:01:55,465 --> 01:01:57,676
Gwendolen, my darling.

1091
01:01:57,676 --> 01:02:00,679
I knew there must be some
misunderstanding Miss Fairfax.

1092
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:02,681
The man whose arm is
at present around your waist...

1093
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:06,185
is my guardian
Mr. John Worthing.

1094
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:08,687
I beg your pardon?

1095
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:11,565
This is Uncle Jack.

1096
01:02:11,565 --> 01:02:13,025
Jack?

1097
01:02:16,528 --> 01:02:18,906
Are you called Algy?

1098
01:02:18,906 --> 01:02:21,200
I cannot deny it.

1099
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:25,204
Is your name really John?

1100
01:02:25,204 --> 01:02:27,039
I could deny it if I liked.

1101
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:28,707
I could deny anything
if I liked...

1102
01:02:28,707 --> 01:02:29,875
but it certainly is John.

1103
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:31,543
It has been John for years.

1104
01:02:31,543 --> 01:02:33,712
A gross deception has been
practiced on both of us.

1105
01:02:33,712 --> 01:02:36,548
-My poor wounded Cecily.
-My sweet wronged Gwendolen.

1106
01:02:36,548 --> 01:02:38,050
Ohh.

1107
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:40,552
You will call me sister,
will you not?

1108
01:02:40,552 --> 01:02:41,887
Of course.

1109
01:02:41,887 --> 01:02:43,847
Let us go
into the house sister.

1110
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:46,058
They will hardly venture
to come after us there.

1111
01:02:46,058 --> 01:02:48,852
No. Men are so cowardly,
aren't they?

1112
01:02:54,191 --> 01:02:56,902
How you can sit there
calmly eating muffins...

1113
01:02:56,902 --> 01:02:58,904
when we're in this horrible
trouble I can't make out.

1114
01:02:58,904 --> 01:03:00,614
You seem to me to be
perfectly heartless.

1115
01:03:00,614 --> 01:03:04,785
I can hardly eat muffins
in an agitated manner, can l?

1116
01:03:04,785 --> 01:03:06,912
The butter
would probably get on my cuffs.

1117
01:03:06,912 --> 01:03:09,331
I say, it's perfectly heartless
you're eating muffins at all...

1118
01:03:09,331 --> 01:03:10,749
under the circumstances.

1119
01:03:10,749 --> 01:03:13,126
When I'm in trouble.
eating is my only consolation.

1120
01:03:13,126 --> 01:03:16,004
Indeed, when I'm
in really great trouble...

1121
01:03:16,004 --> 01:03:18,841
as anyone who knows me
intimately will tell you...

1122
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:21,260
I refuse everything
except food and drink.

1123
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,262
At the present moment,
I am eating muffins...

1124
01:03:23,262 --> 01:03:25,389
because I am unhappy.

1125
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:28,100
Besides, I am
particularly fond of muffins.

1126
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,601
There's no reason why
you should eat them all...

1127
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:31,228
in that greedy way.

1128
01:03:36,441 --> 01:03:38,735
Would you like some tea cake?
I don't like tea cake.

1129
01:03:38,735 --> 01:03:40,863
Good heavens.
I suppose a man...

1130
01:03:40,863 --> 01:03:43,448
may eat his own muffins
in his own garden.

1131
01:03:43,448 --> 01:03:45,576
They seem to be eating muffins.

1132
01:03:48,245 --> 01:03:49,997
But you just said
it was perfectly heartless...

1133
01:03:49,997 --> 01:03:51,165
to eat muffins.

1134
01:03:51,165 --> 01:03:52,833
I said it was
perfectly heartless...

1135
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:54,710
of you
under the circumstances.

1136
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:56,128
That is a very different thing.

1137
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:57,754
Maybe, but the muffins
are the same.

1138
01:03:57,754 --> 01:03:59,131
No.

1139
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:00,465
Give them to me!

1140
01:04:00,465 --> 01:04:01,884
Well, I certainly don't
rate your chances...

1141
01:04:01,884 --> 01:04:03,844
With my ward, Algernon.

1142
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:05,220
Well, I don't think
there's much likelihood...

1143
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:09,224
of you, Jack, and Miss Fairfax
being united, Jack!

1144
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:20,194
Mm-hmm.

1145
01:04:25,032 --> 01:04:27,117
But is there
any particular infant...

1146
01:04:27,117 --> 01:04:29,536
in whom you are interested,
Mr. Worthing?

1147
01:04:29,536 --> 01:04:31,371
The fact is, dear doctor...

1148
01:04:31,371 --> 01:04:33,332
I would like to be christened
myself.

1149
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:37,294
This afternoon, if you have
nothing better to do.

1150
01:04:39,004 --> 01:04:43,050
Surely, Mr. Worthing,
you've been christened already.

1151
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:45,344
I don't remember
anything about it.

1152
01:04:45,344 --> 01:04:46,637
Of course, I don't know...

1153
01:04:46,637 --> 01:04:48,347
if the thing
would bother you in any way...

1154
01:04:48,347 --> 01:04:51,850
or if you think
that I'm a little too old now.

1155
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:54,269
No, no, no.
Not at all, not at all.

1156
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:57,272
The sprinkling
and, indeed, immersion...

1157
01:04:57,272 --> 01:05:01,819
of adults is
a perfectly canonical practice.

1158
01:05:01,819 --> 01:05:06,198
What hour would you wish
the ceremony performed?

1159
01:05:06,198 --> 01:05:08,033
I might trot round
at about six o'clock...

1160
01:05:08,033 --> 01:05:09,201
if that would suit you.

1161
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:11,328
Oh, perfectly, perfectly.

1162
01:05:11,328 --> 01:05:12,496
Thank you.

1163
01:05:17,543 --> 01:05:19,127
But we cannot both be
christened Ernest.

1164
01:05:19,127 --> 01:05:20,712
It's absurd.

1165
01:05:20,712 --> 01:05:22,673
I have a perfect right
to be christened if I like.

1166
01:05:22,673 --> 01:05:24,049
But you've been christened
already.

1167
01:05:24,049 --> 01:05:25,384
Yes, but I haven't been
christened for years.

1168
01:05:25,384 --> 01:05:27,219
But you've been christened.
That is the important thing.

1169
01:05:27,219 --> 01:05:30,389
Quite so. So, I know
my constitution can stand it.

1170
01:05:30,389 --> 01:05:31,682
If you're not quite sure...

1171
01:05:31,682 --> 01:05:33,183
about your ever
having been christened...

1172
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,977
I must say,
I think it rather dangerous...

1173
01:05:34,977 --> 01:05:36,270
your venturing on it now.

1174
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:39,565
Oh, nonsense.
You are always talking nonsense.

1175
01:05:41,567 --> 01:05:43,068
Unh!

1176
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,240
Tuhh!

1177
01:06:02,588 --> 01:06:04,756
Let us preserve
a dignified silence.

1178
01:06:04,756 --> 01:06:07,384
Certainly.
It's the only thing to do now.

1179
01:06:32,826 --> 01:06:34,453
This dignified silence
seems to have produced...

1180
01:06:34,453 --> 01:06:35,746
an unpleasant effect.

1181
01:06:35,746 --> 01:06:37,623
A most distasteful one.

1182
01:07:45,107 --> 01:07:46,567
We will not be
the first to speak.

1183
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:47,901
Certainly not.

1184
01:07:47,901 --> 01:07:50,654
Mr. Worthing, I have something
very particular to ask you.

1185
01:07:50,654 --> 01:07:52,072
Much depends on your reply.

1186
01:07:52,072 --> 01:07:54,658
Gwendolen,
your common sense is invaluable.

1187
01:07:54,658 --> 01:07:58,412
Mr. Moncrieff, kindly answer me
the following question.

1188
01:07:58,412 --> 01:08:01,206
Why did you pretend to be
my guardian's brother?

1189
01:08:01,206 --> 01:08:03,584
In order that I might have
an opportunity of meeting you.

1190
01:08:03,584 --> 01:08:06,503
That certainly seems
a satisfactory explanation.

1191
01:08:06,503 --> 01:08:09,173
Yes, dear,
if you can believe him.

1192
01:08:09,173 --> 01:08:11,258
Well, I don't,
but that doesn't affect...

1193
01:08:11,258 --> 01:08:12,968
the wonderful beauty
of his answer.

1194
01:08:12,968 --> 01:08:15,053
True. In matters
of grave importance...

1195
01:08:15,053 --> 01:08:17,556
style, not sincerity,
is the vital thing.

1196
01:08:17,556 --> 01:08:20,225
Mr. Worthing,
what possible explanation...

1197
01:08:20,225 --> 01:08:23,520
can you offer me for
pretending to have a brother?

1198
01:08:28,025 --> 01:08:30,444
Was it in order that
you might have an opportunity...

1199
01:08:30,444 --> 01:08:34,531
of coming up to town to see me
as often as possible?

1200
01:08:34,531 --> 01:08:37,451
Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?

1201
01:08:37,451 --> 01:08:39,411
I have the gravest doubts
on the subject...

1202
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:42,414
but I intend to crush them.

1203
01:08:44,041 --> 01:08:48,003
Their explanations appear
to be quite satisfactory, espe--

1204
01:08:49,338 --> 01:08:50,756
Especially Mr. Worthing's.

1205
01:08:50,756 --> 01:08:53,217
That seems to me to have
the stamp of truth upon it.

1206
01:08:53,217 --> 01:08:55,928
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.

1207
01:08:55,928 --> 01:08:59,389
His voice alone seemed to
inspire absolute credulity.

1208
01:08:59,389 --> 01:09:00,599
Then you think
we should forgive them?

1209
01:09:00,599 --> 01:09:01,767
Yes.

1210
01:09:03,769 --> 01:09:05,062
I mean, no.

1211
01:09:05,062 --> 01:09:06,730
True, there are principles
at stake...

1212
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:08,524
that one cannot surrender.

1213
01:09:18,075 --> 01:09:21,495
Your Christian names are
still an insuperable barrier.

1214
01:09:21,495 --> 01:09:22,913
That is all.

1215
01:09:22,913 --> 01:09:25,332
-Our Christian names?
-Is that all?

1216
01:09:25,332 --> 01:09:27,751
We're going to be
christened this afternoon.

1217
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:30,629
For my sake, you're prepared
to do this terrible thing?

1218
01:09:30,629 --> 01:09:31,922
I am.

1219
01:09:31,922 --> 01:09:35,133
To please me, you're ready
to face this fearful ordeal?

1220
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:36,301
I am.

1221
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:37,761
Where questions of
self-sacrifice are concerned...

1222
01:09:37,761 --> 01:09:39,012
men are infinitely beyond us.

1223
01:09:39,012 --> 01:09:41,306
-We are.
-Darling.

1224
01:09:41,306 --> 01:09:42,808
Darling.

1225
01:09:45,144 --> 01:09:48,147
-Lady Bracknell.
-Gwendolen!

1226
01:09:48,147 --> 01:09:50,649
What does this mean?

1227
01:09:50,649 --> 01:09:54,611
Merely that I am engaged to be
married to Mr. Worthing, Mama.

1228
01:09:54,611 --> 01:09:56,238
Come here.

1229
01:09:56,238 --> 01:09:57,447
Sit down.

1230
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:01,285
Sit down immediately.

1231
01:10:07,499 --> 01:10:09,126
Of course, you will
clearly understand, sir...

1232
01:10:09,126 --> 01:10:11,295
that all communication between
yourself and my daughter...

1233
01:10:11,295 --> 01:10:13,630
must cease immediately
from this moment.

1234
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:16,175
On this point, as indeed
on all points, I am firm.

1235
01:10:16,175 --> 01:10:18,427
I am engaged to be married
to Gwendolen, Lady Bracknell.

1236
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:21,680
You are
nothing of the kind, sir.

1237
01:10:24,475 --> 01:10:27,853
And now, as regards Algy...

1238
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:31,982
Algy?

1239
01:10:31,982 --> 01:10:33,734
Yes, Aunt Augusta.

1240
01:10:33,734 --> 01:10:35,861
May I ask if it is
in this house...

1241
01:10:35,861 --> 01:10:38,197
that your invalid friend
Mr. Bunbury resides?

1242
01:10:38,197 --> 01:10:40,282
Oh, no,
Bunbury doesn't live here.

1243
01:10:40,282 --> 01:10:42,493
Bunbury's somewhere else
at the present.

1244
01:10:42,493 --> 01:10:45,370
In fact, um, ahem...

1245
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:47,498
Bunbury is dead.

1246
01:10:48,874 --> 01:10:52,419
-Dead?
-Dead.

1247
01:10:52,419 --> 01:10:54,213
When did Mr. Bunbury die?

1248
01:10:54,213 --> 01:10:56,006
His death must've been
extremely sudden.

1249
01:10:56,006 --> 01:10:58,550
Bunbury died this afternoon.

1250
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:00,344
What did he die of?

1251
01:11:00,344 --> 01:11:02,346
Bunbury?

1252
01:11:02,346 --> 01:11:04,723
He was quite exploded.

1253
01:11:04,723 --> 01:11:07,684
Exploded?

1254
01:11:07,684 --> 01:11:09,061
Mm.

1255
01:11:09,061 --> 01:11:11,814
Was he the victim
of some revolutionary outrage?

1256
01:11:11,814 --> 01:11:13,482
I was not aware that
Mr. Bunbury was interested...

1257
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:14,858
in social legislation.

1258
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:18,570
My dear Aunt Augusta,
I mean he was found out.

1259
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:21,114
The doctors found out
that Bunbury could not live.

1260
01:11:21,114 --> 01:11:22,866
That is what I mean.

1261
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:24,117
So Bunbury died.

1262
01:11:25,327 --> 01:11:27,162
He seems to have had
great confidence...

1263
01:11:27,162 --> 01:11:29,414
in the opinion
of his physicians.

1264
01:11:29,414 --> 01:11:31,250
I am glad, however,
that he made his up mind...

1265
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:33,502
at the last to some
definite course of action...

1266
01:11:33,502 --> 01:11:36,129
and acted under
proper medical advice.

1267
01:11:36,129 --> 01:11:40,467
And now that we have finally
got rid of this Mr. Bunbury...

1268
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:43,762
may I ask, Mr. Worthing,
who is that young person...

1269
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:46,098
whose hand my nephew Algernon
is now holding...

1270
01:11:46,098 --> 01:11:50,435
in what seems to me to be
a peculiarly unnecessary manner?

1271
01:11:50,435 --> 01:11:53,063
That lady is
Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward.

1272
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:56,108
I am engaged
to be married Aunt Augusta.

1273
01:11:56,108 --> 01:11:57,276
I beg your pardon?

1274
01:11:57,276 --> 01:11:59,987
Mr. Moncrieff and I
are engaged, Lady Bracknell.

1275
01:11:59,987 --> 01:12:02,114
I do not know
whether there's anything...

1276
01:12:02,114 --> 01:12:03,907
peculiarly exciting
about the air...

1277
01:12:03,907 --> 01:12:06,243
of this particular part
of Hertfordshire...

1278
01:12:06,243 --> 01:12:08,662
but the number of engagements
that go on seem to me...

1279
01:12:08,662 --> 01:12:10,789
to be considerably above
the proper average...

1280
01:12:10,789 --> 01:12:14,626
that statistics have laid down
for our guidance.

1281
01:12:14,626 --> 01:12:15,794
Mr. Worthing...

1282
01:12:15,794 --> 01:12:18,338
is Miss Cardew
at all connected...

1283
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:21,258
with any of the larger
railway stations in London?

1284
01:12:21,258 --> 01:12:25,262
I merely desire information.

1285
01:12:25,262 --> 01:12:26,513
Until recently,
I was not aware...

1286
01:12:26,513 --> 01:12:28,974
that there were
any families or persons...

1287
01:12:28,974 --> 01:12:30,976
whose origin was a terminus.

1288
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:36,440
Gwendolen, the time approaches
for our departure.

1289
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:37,774
We have not a moment to lose.

1290
01:12:37,774 --> 01:12:39,109
As a matter of form,
Mr. Worthing, I'd better ask...

1291
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:41,028
if Miss Cardew
has any little fortune.

1292
01:12:41,028 --> 01:12:45,616
Oh, about 1 30,000
in the funds, that is all.

1293
01:12:45,616 --> 01:12:47,659
Good-bye, Lady Bracknell.
So pleased to have seen you.

1294
01:12:47,659 --> 01:12:50,746
A moment, Mr. Worthing.

1295
01:12:50,746 --> 01:12:54,208
A hundred and thirty thousand
pounds?

1296
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:57,586
And in the funds?

1297
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:03,842
Miss Cardew seems to me to be
a most attractive young lady...

1298
01:13:03,842 --> 01:13:06,178
now that I look at her.

1299
01:13:06,178 --> 01:13:08,806
Come over here, dear.

1300
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:14,478
The chin a little higher, dear.

1301
01:13:14,478 --> 01:13:17,856
Style largely depends
on the way the chin is worn.

1302
01:13:17,856 --> 01:13:20,526
They're worn very high
just at present.

1303
01:13:20,526 --> 01:13:22,861
-Algy?
-Yes, Aunt Augusta.

1304
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:24,154
There are distinct
social possibilities...

1305
01:13:24,154 --> 01:13:25,572
in Miss Cardew's profile.

1306
01:13:25,572 --> 01:13:27,783
Cecily is the sweetest,
dearest, prettiest girl...

1307
01:13:27,783 --> 01:13:29,368
in the whole world,
and I don't give tuppence...

1308
01:13:29,368 --> 01:13:30,911
for her social possibilities.

1309
01:13:30,911 --> 01:13:34,331
Never speak disrespectfully
of society, Algernon.

1310
01:13:34,331 --> 01:13:37,376
Only people who can't
get into it do that.

1311
01:13:38,627 --> 01:13:39,878
Dear child.
you know of course...

1312
01:13:39,878 --> 01:13:43,465
that Algy has nothing
but his debts to depend upon.

1313
01:13:43,465 --> 01:13:47,427
But I do not approve
of mercenary marriages.

1314
01:13:47,427 --> 01:13:50,514
Indeed, when I married
Lord Bracknell...

1315
01:13:50,514 --> 01:13:52,850
I had no fortune of any kind.

1316
01:14:03,902 --> 01:14:06,864
But I never
dreamed for a moment...

1317
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:09,741
of allowing that
to stand in my way.

1318
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:15,581
Well, I suppose
I must give my consent.

1319
01:14:15,581 --> 01:14:17,457
Thank you, Aunt Augusta.

1320
01:14:17,457 --> 01:14:19,418
I beg your pardon
for interrupting you...

1321
01:14:19,418 --> 01:14:21,086
Lady Bracknell, but I am
Miss Cardew's guardian.

1322
01:14:21,086 --> 01:14:23,046
She cannot marry
without my consent...

1323
01:14:23,046 --> 01:14:24,381
until she comes of age...

1324
01:14:24,381 --> 01:14:28,218
and that consent
I absolutely decline to give.

1325
01:14:28,218 --> 01:14:31,096
Upon what grounds, may I ask?

1326
01:14:31,096 --> 01:14:34,308
I suspect him
of being untruthful.

1327
01:14:34,308 --> 01:14:35,976
Untruthful?

1328
01:14:35,976 --> 01:14:38,145
My nephew Algy?

1329
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:41,440
I fear there can be no
possible doubt about the matter.

1330
01:14:45,819 --> 01:14:48,155
During my temporary absence
in London...

1331
01:14:48,155 --> 01:14:50,741
on an important question
of romance...

1332
01:14:50,741 --> 01:14:53,160
he obtained admission
to my house...

1333
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:57,247
by means of the false pretense
of being my brother.

1334
01:14:58,540 --> 01:14:59,958
He then proceeded
to win over...

1335
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:01,168
the affections
of my only ward...

1336
01:15:01,168 --> 01:15:03,086
when his own intentions,
I'm utterly convinced...

1337
01:15:03,086 --> 01:15:04,838
were purely financial.

1338
01:15:04,838 --> 01:15:06,632
Deny it if you dare.

1339
01:15:06,632 --> 01:15:08,717
He subsequently stayed
to tea...

1340
01:15:08,717 --> 01:15:11,887
and devoured
every single muffin...

1341
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:14,139
and what makes his behavior
all the more heartless...

1342
01:15:14,139 --> 01:15:15,474
is that he was perfectly
aware from the start...

1343
01:15:15,474 --> 01:15:17,476
that I have no brother,
that I never had a brother...

1344
01:15:17,476 --> 01:15:19,937
and that I don't intend to have
a brother, not even of any kind.

1345
01:15:19,937 --> 01:15:22,147
-Uncle Jack, please!
-On my word, Jack.

1346
01:15:22,147 --> 01:15:25,567
Come here, sweet child.

1347
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:27,653
How old are you, dear?

1348
01:15:27,653 --> 01:15:30,948
-Eighteen, Aunt Augusta.
-Eighteen.

1349
01:15:30,948 --> 01:15:33,325
Well, it will not be long
before you are of age...

1350
01:15:33,325 --> 01:15:35,619
and free from the restraints
of your guardian.

1351
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:38,372
According to the terms
of her grandfather's will...

1352
01:15:38,372 --> 01:15:42,334
she does not come legally
of age until she is thirty-five.

1353
01:15:42,334 --> 01:15:45,712
That does not seem to me
to be a grave objection.

1354
01:15:45,712 --> 01:15:48,006
Thirty-five
is a very attractive age.

1355
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:49,591
London society
is full of women...

1356
01:15:49,591 --> 01:15:51,844
of the very highest birth
who have...

1357
01:15:51,844 --> 01:15:55,514
of their own free choice,
remained thirty-five for years.

1358
01:15:55,514 --> 01:15:58,350
Algy, could you wait for me
till I was thirty-five?

1359
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:00,269
Of course, I could.
You know I could.

1360
01:16:00,269 --> 01:16:02,229
Yes, I felt it instinctively.

1361
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:04,148
But I couldn't wait
all that time.

1362
01:16:04,148 --> 01:16:06,233
Then what is to be done,
Cecily?

1363
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:08,944
I don't know, Mr. Moncrieff.

1364
01:16:10,779 --> 01:16:12,489
My dear Mr. Worthing...

1365
01:16:12,489 --> 01:16:15,826
as Miss Cardew
states quite positively...

1366
01:16:15,826 --> 01:16:18,328
that she cannot wait
until she is thirty-five--

1367
01:16:18,328 --> 01:16:19,872
a remark
which I am bound to say...

1368
01:16:19,872 --> 01:16:22,916
seems to me to show
a somewhat impatient nature--

1369
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:27,254
I would beg you
to reconsider your decision.

1370
01:16:27,254 --> 01:16:30,591
Dear Lady Bracknell, the matter
is entirely in your own hands.

1371
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,801
The moment you consent
to my marriage with Gwendolen...

1372
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:34,761
I will most gladly allow
your nephew...

1373
01:16:34,761 --> 01:16:37,014
to form an alliance
with my ward.

1374
01:16:38,765 --> 01:16:43,729
You must be aware that what you
propose is out of the question.

1375
01:16:43,729 --> 01:16:45,063
Then a passionate celibacy...

1376
01:16:45,063 --> 01:16:48,734
is all any of us
can look forward to.

1377
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:50,319
-Oh, but Mama.
-Come, dear.

1378
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:52,613
We've already missed five,
if not six, trains.

1379
01:16:52,613 --> 01:16:55,407
To miss any more might expose
us to comment on the platform.

1380
01:16:56,575 --> 01:16:58,368
Everything is quite ready
for the christenings.

1381
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:01,538
The christenings, sir?

1382
01:17:01,538 --> 01:17:03,916
Is not that
somewhat premature?

1383
01:17:03,916 --> 01:17:06,919
But both of these gentlemen
have expressed a desire...

1384
01:17:06,919 --> 01:17:08,921
for immediate baptism.

1385
01:17:08,921 --> 01:17:13,050
At their age? The idea
is grotesque and irreligious.

1386
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:15,093
Algy,
I forbid you to be baptized.

1387
01:17:15,093 --> 01:17:17,596
I will not hear
of such excesses.

1388
01:17:19,097 --> 01:17:23,727
I'm sorry
to interrupt, Dr. Chasuble.

1389
01:17:23,727 --> 01:17:25,020
Yes, yes.

1390
01:17:29,191 --> 01:17:31,985
Miss Prism
has asked me to tell you...

1391
01:17:31,985 --> 01:17:34,446
she's waiting for you
in the vestry.

1392
01:17:34,446 --> 01:17:37,241
Indeed. I believe she's been
waiting for some time.

1393
01:17:37,241 --> 01:17:42,246
Miss Prism in the vestry.

1394
01:17:42,246 --> 01:17:44,164
Waiting for you.

1395
01:17:44,164 --> 01:17:45,791
Yes.

1396
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:47,376
Miss Prism?

1397
01:17:48,752 --> 01:17:51,046
Did I hear you mention
a Miss Prism?

1398
01:17:51,046 --> 01:17:52,464
Yes madame. I'm--

1399
01:17:52,464 --> 01:17:54,800
I'm on my--

1400
01:17:56,301 --> 01:17:58,470
-Bless you.
-Yes, madame, I'm on my way...

1401
01:17:58,470 --> 01:17:59,972
to--to--to join her.

1402
01:17:59,972 --> 01:18:02,599
Is this Miss Prism
a female of repellent aspect...

1403
01:18:02,599 --> 01:18:04,810
remotely connected
with education?

1404
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:07,688
She is the most cultivated
of ladies...

1405
01:18:07,688 --> 01:18:10,149
and the picture
of respectability.

1406
01:18:10,149 --> 01:18:12,109
It is obviously
the same person.

1407
01:18:12,109 --> 01:18:15,320
Dr. Chasuble,
take me to the vestry at once.

1408
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:27,499
I've been expecting you.
dear doctor.

1409
01:18:30,335 --> 01:18:31,795
Prism!

1410
01:18:37,843 --> 01:18:39,094
Prism.

1411
01:18:47,686 --> 01:18:48,854
Prism!

1412
01:18:54,526 --> 01:18:56,195
Where is that baby?

1413
01:19:13,212 --> 01:19:15,547
LADY BRACKNELL:
Thirty-four years ago Prism...

1414
01:19:15,547 --> 01:19:17,174
you left
Lord Bracknell's house...

1415
01:19:17,174 --> 01:19:19,426
Number 104.
Upper Grosvenor Street...

1416
01:19:19,426 --> 01:19:20,719
in charge of a perambulator...

1417
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:23,722
that contained a baby
of the male sex.

1418
01:19:25,557 --> 01:19:27,559
You never returned.

1419
01:19:27,559 --> 01:19:30,562
A few weeks later, through
the elaborate investigations...

1420
01:19:30,562 --> 01:19:32,189
of the metropolitan police...

1421
01:19:32,189 --> 01:19:34,900
the perambulator
was discovered at midnight...

1422
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:39,571
standing by itself in
a remote corner of Bayswater.

1423
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:42,449
It contained the manuscript
of a three-volume novel...

1424
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:46,745
of more than usually
revolting sentimentality.

1425
01:19:48,163 --> 01:19:50,833
But the baby was not there.

1426
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:53,585
Prism, where is that baby?

1427
01:19:53,585 --> 01:19:55,754
Lady Bracknell...

1428
01:19:55,754 --> 01:19:59,132
I admit with shame
that I do not know.

1429
01:19:59,132 --> 01:20:02,886
The plain facts
of the case are these--

1430
01:20:02,886 --> 01:20:05,097
on the morning
of the day in question--

1431
01:20:05,097 --> 01:20:07,975
a day that is forever branded
on my memory--

1432
01:20:07,975 --> 01:20:09,601
I prepared, as usual...

1433
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:12,938
to take the baby
out in its perambulator.

1434
01:20:12,938 --> 01:20:19,027
I had also with me a somewhat
old, but capacious handbag...

1435
01:20:19,027 --> 01:20:21,530
in which I had intended
to place the manuscript...

1436
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:23,824
of a work of fiction
that I had written...

1437
01:20:23,824 --> 01:20:27,578
during my few unoccupied hours.

1438
01:20:27,578 --> 01:20:31,123
In a moment
of mental abstraction...

1439
01:20:31,123 --> 01:20:33,792
for which
I never can forgive myself...

1440
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:37,337
I deposited the manuscript
in the bassinet...

1441
01:20:40,883 --> 01:20:44,928
and placed
the baby in the handbag.

1442
01:20:50,225 --> 01:20:53,103
...manuscript
in the bassinet...

1443
01:20:53,103 --> 01:20:56,565
and placed the baby
in the handbag.

1444
01:20:58,525 --> 01:21:01,236
But where did you deposit
the handbag?

1445
01:21:02,654 --> 01:21:04,531
Do not ask me, Mr. Worthing.

1446
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:07,659
Miss Prism this is a matter
of no small importance to me.

1447
01:21:07,659 --> 01:21:09,870
I insist on knowing where
you deposited the handbag...

1448
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:11,497
that contained that infant.

1449
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,000
I left it in the cloakroom...

1450
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,295
of one of the larger
railway stations in London.

1451
01:21:18,295 --> 01:21:20,172
What railway station?

1452
01:21:20,172 --> 01:21:22,299
Victoria.

1453
01:21:22,299 --> 01:21:25,010
The Brighton line.

1454
01:21:26,845 --> 01:21:28,222
--

1455
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:42,361
Uncle Jack
seems strangely agitated.

1456
01:21:50,118 --> 01:21:52,579
Is this the handbag,
Miss Prism?

1457
01:21:58,168 --> 01:22:01,213
Examine it carefully
before you speak.

1458
01:22:01,213 --> 01:22:05,217
The happiness of more than
one life depends on your answer.

1459
01:22:05,217 --> 01:22:07,177
The bag is undoubtedly mine.

1460
01:22:07,177 --> 01:22:11,557
I am delighted to have it
so unexpectedly restored to me.

1461
01:22:11,557 --> 01:22:13,392
It has been
a great inconvenience...

1462
01:22:13,392 --> 01:22:15,435
being without it
all these years.

1463
01:22:15,435 --> 01:22:18,605
Miss Prism, more is restored
to you than this handbag.

1464
01:22:18,605 --> 01:22:22,234
I was the baby you placed in it.

1465
01:22:22,234 --> 01:22:24,069
-You?
-Yes.

1466
01:22:24,069 --> 01:22:25,612
Mother!

1467
01:22:25,612 --> 01:22:29,241
Oh, Mr. Worthing.
I am unmarried.

1468
01:22:29,241 --> 01:22:30,784
Unmarried?

1469
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:33,328
I cannot deny
that is a serious blow.

1470
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:35,414
But after all,
who has the right...

1471
01:22:35,414 --> 01:22:38,083
to cast a stone
against one who has suffered?

1472
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:41,670
Cannot repentance
wipe out an act of folly?

1473
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:44,256
-Mother, I forgive you!
-No, Mr. Worthing!

1474
01:22:44,256 --> 01:22:45,924
There is some error.

1475
01:22:47,718 --> 01:22:49,470
There is the lady...

1476
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:52,097
who can tell you
who you really are.

1477
01:22:55,267 --> 01:22:57,728
Lady Bracknell,
I hate to seem inquisitive...

1478
01:22:57,728 --> 01:23:01,773
but would you kindly inform me
who I am?

1479
01:23:01,773 --> 01:23:05,819
You are the son of my poor
sister Mrs. Moncrieff...

1480
01:23:05,819 --> 01:23:09,698
and consequently
Algy's younger brother.

1481
01:23:14,244 --> 01:23:17,039
Algy's younger brother?

1482
01:23:36,433 --> 01:23:38,769
Hmm. Heh.

1483
01:23:42,981 --> 01:23:45,734
So...

1484
01:23:45,734 --> 01:23:48,487
I have a brother after all.

1485
01:23:48,487 --> 01:23:50,280
Yes.

1486
01:23:55,953 --> 01:23:57,996
I knew I had a brother!

1487
01:24:00,999 --> 01:24:02,960
I always said
I had a brother. Heh.

1488
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,421
Cecily, how could you ever have
doubted that I had a brother?

1489
01:24:06,421 --> 01:24:08,507
Dr. Chasuble,
my unfortunate brother.

1490
01:24:08,507 --> 01:24:09,675
How do you do?

1491
01:24:09,675 --> 01:24:11,176
Miss Prism,
my unfortunate brother.

1492
01:24:11,176 --> 01:24:12,344
How do you do?

1493
01:24:12,344 --> 01:24:13,804
Gwendolen,
my unfortunate brother.

1494
01:24:13,804 --> 01:24:15,055
How do you do?

1495
01:24:15,055 --> 01:24:18,350
Lady Bracknell, my--my brother.

1496
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:20,018
-Algy!
-Algy!

1497
01:24:20,018 --> 01:24:21,562
Oh!

1498
01:24:21,562 --> 01:24:23,856
Oh!

1499
01:24:23,856 --> 01:24:25,023
-So?
-Oh!

1500
01:24:35,534 --> 01:24:38,412
Under these strange
and unforeseen circumstances...

1501
01:24:38,412 --> 01:24:40,873
Mr. Moncrieff...

1502
01:24:40,873 --> 01:24:43,417
you may kiss your Aunt Augusta.

1503
01:24:49,923 --> 01:24:52,217
John!

1504
01:24:55,596 --> 01:24:58,056
MISS Mr. Moncrieff.

1505
01:24:58,056 --> 01:25:00,934
After all that has occurred...

1506
01:25:00,934 --> 01:25:04,062
and any inconvenience
I may have caused you...

1507
01:25:04,062 --> 01:25:05,731
in your infancy...

1508
01:25:05,731 --> 01:25:09,735
I feel it is my duty to resign
my position in this household.

1509
01:25:09,735 --> 01:25:12,404
The suggestion is absurd.
I won't hear of it.

1510
01:25:12,404 --> 01:25:15,991
Sir, it is my duty to leave.

1511
01:25:15,991 --> 01:25:19,912
I have really nothing more
to teach dear Cecily.

1512
01:25:19,912 --> 01:25:22,748
In the very difficult
accomplishment...

1513
01:25:22,748 --> 01:25:24,583
of getting married...

1514
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:26,627
I fear
my sweet and clever pupil...

1515
01:25:26,627 --> 01:25:29,755
has far outstripped her teacher.

1516
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:33,759
No.

1517
01:25:49,525 --> 01:25:52,027
A moment Miss Prism.

1518
01:25:55,322 --> 01:25:57,407
Dr. Chasuble.

1519
01:25:57,407 --> 01:25:59,284
I've come
to the conclusion...

1520
01:25:59,284 --> 01:26:02,037
that the primitive church
is in error...

1521
01:26:02,037 --> 01:26:05,415
on certain points
on the question of matrimony.

1522
01:26:05,415 --> 01:26:11,088
Corrupt readings seem
to have crept into the text.

1523
01:26:11,088 --> 01:26:14,675
In consequence. I--

1524
01:26:14,675 --> 01:26:17,553
I beg to solicit...

1525
01:26:17,553 --> 01:26:20,305
the honor of your hand.

1526
01:26:20,305 --> 01:26:24,101
Frederick.

1527
01:26:24,101 --> 01:26:25,435
Laetitia.

1528
01:26:26,979 --> 01:26:29,356
-My dear Cecily.
-My dearest Algernon.

1529
01:26:29,356 --> 01:26:30,649
My own Gwendolen.

1530
01:26:30,649 --> 01:26:32,985
My own--
But wait! Who are you?

1531
01:26:32,985 --> 01:26:36,029
I mean, what is your
Christian name, Mr. Moncrieff?

1532
01:26:36,029 --> 01:26:38,490
Now you have become
someone else.

1533
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:40,617
Good heavens,
I'd quite forgotten that point.

1534
01:26:40,617 --> 01:26:43,495
The question had better be
cleared up at once.

1535
01:26:43,495 --> 01:26:45,247
Aunt Augusta, a moment.

1536
01:26:45,247 --> 01:26:47,332
At the time when Miss Prism
left me in the handbag...

1537
01:26:47,332 --> 01:26:49,334
had I been christened already?

1538
01:26:49,334 --> 01:26:52,337
Yes, I think you were
christened after your father.

1539
01:26:52,337 --> 01:26:55,299
I see. Then what was
my father's Christian name?

1540
01:26:55,299 --> 01:26:57,593
I cannot at the present moment
recall...

1541
01:26:57,593 --> 01:27:00,721
what the general's name was.
I have no doubt he had one.

1542
01:27:00,721 --> 01:27:03,557
Algy, can't you recollect what
our father's Christian name was?

1543
01:27:03,557 --> 01:27:05,392
My dear fellow, we were hardly
on speaking terms.

1544
01:27:05,392 --> 01:27:07,144
He died when I was only three.

1545
01:27:07,144 --> 01:27:08,687
His name would appear
on the army lists...

1546
01:27:08,687 --> 01:27:10,814
of the period,
I suppose, Aunt Augusta.

1547
01:27:10,814 --> 01:27:13,442
The general was essentially
a man of peace...

1548
01:27:13,442 --> 01:27:15,819
except in his domestic life.

1549
01:27:15,819 --> 01:27:17,696
But no doubt
his name would appear...

1550
01:27:17,696 --> 01:27:19,364
on any military directory.

1551
01:27:23,035 --> 01:27:25,204
The army lists
of the last 40 years are here.

1552
01:27:25,204 --> 01:27:28,207
These delightful records should
have been my constant study.

1553
01:27:28,207 --> 01:27:31,335
Lieutenants, captains...

1554
01:27:31,335 --> 01:27:33,420
colonels...

1555
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:35,214
-Oh!
-colonels...

1556
01:27:35,214 --> 01:27:36,507
generals.

1557
01:27:36,507 --> 01:27:38,675
"M."

1558
01:27:38,675 --> 01:27:41,553
"Maxbohm," "Magley"...

1559
01:27:41,553 --> 01:27:44,139
"Markby," "Migsby," "Mobbs,"
"Moncrieff."

1560
01:27:44,139 --> 01:27:46,058
"Lieutenant, 1860.

1561
01:27:46,058 --> 01:27:48,393
"Christian names..."

1562
01:28:02,825 --> 01:28:05,327
I always told you, Gwendolen...

1563
01:28:05,327 --> 01:28:08,539
that my name was Ernest,
didn't l?

1564
01:28:10,874 --> 01:28:12,876
Well, it is Ernest after all.

1565
01:28:17,172 --> 01:28:19,007
I mean, it naturally is Ernest.

1566
01:28:19,007 --> 01:28:21,927
Ernest. My own Ernest.

1567
01:28:21,927 --> 01:28:25,722
I felt from the first that
you could have no other name.

1568
01:28:27,766 --> 01:28:28,976
Mmm.

1569
01:29:04,428 --> 01:29:05,596
My nephew.

1570
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:10,100
You seem to be displaying
signs of triviality.

1571
01:29:11,226 --> 01:29:13,103
On the contrary, Aunt Augusta.

1572
01:29:13,103 --> 01:29:15,189
I've now realized for
the first time in my life...

1573
01:29:15,189 --> 01:29:17,566
the vital importance
of being earnest.

1574
01:31:33,452 --> 01:31:34,703
I think your high notes...

1575
01:31:34,703 --> 01:31:36,205
may have damaged
our chances old boy.

1576
01:31:36,205 --> 01:31:37,539
You do want them
to come down don't you?

1577
01:31:37,539 --> 01:31:38,957
She's never
going to come down...

1578
01:31:38,957 --> 01:31:40,918
if you're singing like that.
Completely out of tune.

1579
01:31:40,918 --> 01:31:43,086
-How dare you?
-I'll take this.

1580
01:31:43,086 --> 01:31:44,755
You leave this to me.
Have a lie down old man.

1581
01:31:44,755 --> 01:31:46,006
No, I'll take this bit.

1582
01:31:46,006 --> 01:31:47,633
Out of my way.
I'm coming through.

1583
01:31:47,633 --> 01:31:49,092
Go easy my dear fellow.

1584
01:31:55,974 --> 01:31:57,684
Overdoing it. Less is more.

1585
01:32:10,823 --> 01:32:13,617
That wasn't so bad was it?

1586
01:32:15,994 --> 01:32:17,704
Maybe they're not
going to come down.

1587
01:32:17,704 --> 01:32:20,457
Think we should go up?
Maybe we should go up.

1588
01:32:20,457 --> 01:32:22,501
Algy.
you're always talking nonsense.

1589
01:32:22,501 --> 01:32:24,878
Well it's better
than listening to it.

1590
01:32:35,514 --> 01:32:37,182
Hmm.

1591
01:33:37,367 --> 01:33:40,746
Did you hear
what I was playing Lane?

1592
01:33:40,746 --> 01:33:43,248
I didn't think it
polite to listen sir.
