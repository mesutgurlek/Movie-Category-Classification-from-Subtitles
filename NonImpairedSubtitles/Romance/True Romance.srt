1
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:14,620
In Jailhouse Rock,
he was everything rockabilly is about.

2
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,081
I mean he is rockabilly:

3
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,375
Mean, surly, nasty, rude.

4
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:24,003
In that movie, he couldn't give a fuck
about nothin'.

5
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:26,881
Except rocking and rolling,
living fast, dying young...

6
00:01:26,964 --> 00:01:29,342
...and leaving a good-looking corpse.

7
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:36,140
I watch that hillbilly
and I want to be him so bad.

8
00:01:38,183 --> 00:01:39,643
Elvis looked good.

9
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:45,148
Hey, I'm no fag.
But Elvis was prettier than most women.

10
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:46,901
You know? Most women.

11
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:54,825
You know I always said,
if I had to fuck a guy. I mean had to...

12
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:56,952
...and my life depended on it...

13
00:01:58,203 --> 00:01:59,621
...l'd fuck Elvis.

14
00:02:01,248 --> 00:02:02,499
I'd fuck Elvis.

15
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:06,169
Really?

16
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:08,630
Well, when he was alive, not now.

17
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:11,425
I don't blame you.

18
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:13,384
So, we'd both fuck Elvis.

19
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,014
It's nice to meet people
with common interests, ain't it?

20
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:23,561
Well, enough about the King.
How about you?

21
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,148
How about me what?

22
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,319
How about you go to the movies
with me tonight?

23
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,572
What are we gonna see?

24
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,325
A Sonny Chiba triple feature.

25
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,869
<i>The Streetfighter,
Return of the Streetfighter...</i>

26
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,912
...and Sister Streetfighter.

27
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,040
Who's Sonny Chiba?

28
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,333
"Who's Sonny Chiba?"

29
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:51,920
Well, he is, bar none, the finest actor
working in martial arts movies today.

30
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,551
You want to take me to a kung fu movie?

31
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,639
Three kung fu movies.

32
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,227
I don't think so.

33
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,606
Not really my cup of tea.

34
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,108
All right.

35
00:04:51,578 --> 00:04:54,873
<i>l had to come all the way
from the highways and byways...</i>

36
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:57,000
<i>...of Tallahassee, Florida...</i>

37
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,836
<i>...to Motor City, Detroit
to find my true love.</i>

38
00:05:01,004 --> 00:05:03,632
<i>lf you gave me a million years to ponder...</i>

39
00:05:03,923 --> 00:05:08,302
<i>...l would never have guessed that true
romance and Detroit would go together.</i>

40
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,516
<i>And to this day, the events that followed
all seem like a distant dream.</i>

41
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:16,144
<i>But the dream was real...</i>

42
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:19,064
<i>...and was to change our lives forever.</i>

43
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:26,028
<i>l kept asking Clarence why our world
seemed to be collapsing...</i>

44
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:28,155
<i>...and everything was so shitty.</i>

45
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:30,115
<i>And he'd say:</i>

46
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:33,410
<i>"That's the way it goes. But don't forget...</i>

47
00:05:33,952 --> 00:05:35,955
<i>"...it goes the other way too. "</i>

48
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:39,332
<i>That's the way romance is.</i>

49
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,502
<i>Usually that's the way it goes.</i>

50
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:47,256
<i>But every once in a while,
it goes the other way too.</i>

51
00:05:53,805 --> 00:05:55,932
<i>My heart beats and there is time.</i>

52
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:16,326
<i>Don't move, Tojo.</i>

53
00:06:17,828 --> 00:06:19,830
<i>You'll be unconscious soon...</i>

54
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,290
<i>lt's an ancient technique.</i>

55
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:22,875
<i>Oxygen.</i>

56
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:25,169
<i>Come.</i>

57
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:33,635
Oh, look what happened!
Oh, God, I am so sorry.

58
00:06:34,136 --> 00:06:36,680
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

59
00:06:36,805 --> 00:06:39,725
Oh, Jesus, I am the clumsiest person
in the world.

60
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:42,102
That's all right. Accidents happen.

61
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:46,064
What a wonderful philosophy.
Thanks for being a sweetheart.

62
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:48,482
Because you could have been a real dick.

63
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:49,900
<i>Come on! Ready?</i>

64
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:54,030
<i>Larry, where are we going?</i>

65
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:07,876
<i>Look, we don't know
what will be coming next.</i>

66
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:11,046
<i>You mean you're scared?</i>

67
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:13,048
<i>Hey, laundromat clothes!</i>

68
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,342
You mind if I smoke?

69
00:07:16,092 --> 00:07:17,177
No.

70
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:20,847
Listen, do you mind filling me in
on what I missed?

71
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:22,848
No, no.

72
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:29,104
See this, that guy up there?
It's Sonny Chiba.

73
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,898
The Oriental?

74
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,109
Yeah, the one in black.

75
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:36,029
You want a Goober?

76
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:41,742
Yeah. See, in the beginning of the movie
he was hired to get this guy.

77
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:44,036
You have got popcorn all over you.

78
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:45,871
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

79
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:50,167
Is he supposed to be a good guy?

80
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,046
He ain't so much a good guy
as he's just a bad motherfucker.

81
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:57,465
I mean, he gets paid by people
to fuck guys up. You know.

82
00:08:02,804 --> 00:08:05,264
You came to see three kung fu movies?

83
00:08:05,974 --> 00:08:07,225
Sure, why not?

84
00:08:07,892 --> 00:08:11,562
Nothing, nothing. You're a girl
after my own heart. That's all.

85
00:08:11,896 --> 00:08:13,815
Do you know what time it is?

86
00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:15,983
It's about 12:00.

87
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:19,111
I suppose you've got to get up early, huh?

88
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:21,863
No, not particularly, how come?

89
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,493
It's just, after a movie,
I like to go get some pie...

90
00:08:26,576 --> 00:08:27,661
...and talk about it.

91
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:29,454
Sort of a little tradition I have.

92
00:08:30,163 --> 00:08:33,082
Do you like to get pie
after you see a good movie?

93
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,210
Yeah, I love to get pie after a movie.

94
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,465
Would you like to go
get some pie with me?

95
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:43,135
I'd love some pie.

96
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:50,975
In that movie, he couldn't give a fuck
about nothing.

97
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,477
Except rock-and-roll, living fast,
dying young...

98
00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:55,938
...and leaving a good-looking corpse.

99
00:08:56,981 --> 00:08:59,442
Enough about the King. How about you?

100
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:01,360
How about me what?

101
00:09:02,236 --> 00:09:04,155
Well, tell me about yourself.

102
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,239
What do you want to know?

103
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,077
Well, for starters, what do you do?
Where are you from?

104
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:14,122
What's your favorite color?
Who's your favorite movie star?

105
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:15,915
What kind of music do you like?

106
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:18,376
What are your turn-ons, your turnoffs?

107
00:09:18,877 --> 00:09:21,755
I guess the big question is,
do you have a fella?

108
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,341
Okay, ask me again, one by one.

109
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:27,426
What do you do?

110
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:28,594
I don't remember.

111
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:30,304
-Where are you from?
-I don't know.

112
00:09:30,387 --> 00:09:33,599
-What's your favorite color?
-I don't know. Black?

113
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:37,561
-Well, who's your favorite movie star?
-Burt Reynolds.

114
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:39,481
Do you want a bite of my pie?

115
00:09:39,564 --> 00:09:41,523
Yes, I would. A little one.

116
00:09:41,774 --> 00:09:42,858
All right.

117
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:47,780
You all right? It's good. You like it?

118
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:50,867
What kind of music do you like?

119
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:53,912
<i>Phil Spector. Girl-group stuff like,
He is a Rebel.</i>

120
00:09:53,995 --> 00:09:55,705
What are your turn-ons?

121
00:09:57,582 --> 00:10:01,919
Mickey Rourke, a man who can appreciate
the finer things in life, like sugar.

122
00:10:03,462 --> 00:10:05,798
Elvis' voice, kung fu, pie.

123
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:07,341
Turnoffs?

124
00:10:08,717 --> 00:10:09,802
Turnoffs.

125
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:12,930
Persians.

126
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,558
Do you have a fella?

127
00:10:19,227 --> 00:10:21,396
Ask me that one a little bit later.

128
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:26,651
In a theater full of empty seats,
why did you sit by me?

129
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:30,655
Because you looked like a nice guy.

130
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:35,158
So I had to dump my popcorn all over you.

131
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,248
I'll get the check. Where to next?

132
00:10:42,332 --> 00:10:43,500
Can I peek?

133
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:46,128
Now don't peek. Keep your eyes shut.

134
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:50,631
All right, I am turning the lights on.
Okay, open them.

135
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,925
Oh, wow!

136
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:56,595
Wow, what a swell place to work!

137
00:10:57,638 --> 00:10:59,433
Yeah, it's cool. I got the keys...

138
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:02,644
...so I just come in, you know,
read comics, play music.

139
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,604
You worked here a long time?

140
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:06,106
Almost four years.

141
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:08,733
That is a long time.

142
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:10,651
Yeah, but it's not so bad.

143
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:13,195
I'm pretty friendly
with most of the customers.

144
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,032
So I just hang out, bullshit,
read comic books.

145
00:11:16,115 --> 00:11:17,575
You get paid a lot?

146
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:21,537
No, that's where the trouble
comes into paradise.

147
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:23,581
The boss is a pretty nice guy.

148
00:11:23,664 --> 00:11:27,167
He lets you borrow money
from time to time, if you need it.

149
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:33,965
You want to see what
Spiderman No. 1 looks like?

150
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:35,050
You bet.

151
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:39,846
Just great stories, great characters,
beautiful artwork.

152
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:42,765
See, in this one, Nick,
he's gotten this ring here...

153
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,560
...for his sweetheart and he wears it
around his neck on a chain.

154
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:50,773
And later on in the story,
he gets in this fight with this Nazi bastard.

155
00:11:50,856 --> 00:11:52,858
And the Kraut grabs hold of the chain.

156
00:11:52,942 --> 00:11:54,944
Well, the ring goes overboard.

157
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,490
Nick, he dives into the ocean to get it.

158
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:03,409
Isn't that cool?

159
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:50,263
What is it? You're crying?
What did I do? Did I do something?

160
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:51,931
You didn't do nothing.

161
00:13:52,057 --> 00:13:53,224
What is it?

162
00:13:55,352 --> 00:13:57,520
I have something I got to tell you.

163
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:04,276
I didn't just happen to be at that theater.
I was paid to be there.

164
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,323
If you were paid to be there, what are you?
A theater-checker?

165
00:14:09,406 --> 00:14:12,952
You get paid to check the box-office girls
aren't ripping the place off?

166
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:15,496
I'm no theater-checker. I'm a call girl.

167
00:14:17,872 --> 00:14:19,207
You're a whore?

168
00:14:19,582 --> 00:14:22,919
No! I'm a call girl,
and there is a difference, you know!

169
00:14:24,754 --> 00:14:28,509
Okay, here it goes. You know the place
you took me to last night?

170
00:14:28,926 --> 00:14:30,386
The place you work.

171
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:31,887
Heroes for Sale?

172
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,555
You got a boss, right?

173
00:14:33,681 --> 00:14:34,681
Yeah.

174
00:14:35,056 --> 00:14:36,307
Okay, what's his name?

175
00:14:36,432 --> 00:14:37,433
Lance.

176
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:40,270
That's him.
He called the place where I work.

177
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:42,814
He ordered a girl for you.
He wanted you to get laid.

178
00:14:42,897 --> 00:14:46,484
Said you didn't get out much,
and it was your birthday and all.

179
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:50,446
He wanted me to act like I just showed up.

180
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,323
How did he know you were going to be
at that theater?

181
00:14:53,407 --> 00:14:56,076
I go to the movies every year
on my birthday.

182
00:14:56,285 --> 00:14:59,913
He called me this week to find out
what my birthday movie was going to be.

183
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:01,248
You're not mad?

184
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:04,293
No, man. I can't tell you...

185
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:06,878
That was one of the best times I ever had.

186
00:15:07,004 --> 00:15:10,214
It was. You know, I knew something
must be rotten in Denmark.

187
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:12,633
There's no way you could like me
that much.

188
00:15:12,717 --> 00:15:15,886
I was so relieved
when you took off your dress...

189
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,221
...and didn't have a dick.

190
00:15:17,346 --> 00:15:19,640
Stop being so fucking calm about all this!

191
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:21,851
Look in your house.
There's a note on your TV.

192
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:25,021
It only says "Dear Clarence,"
because I couldn't write anymore.

193
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:27,439
So I just said, "Alabama, come clean.

194
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:29,691
"Just tell him what's what.
If he tells you...

195
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:32,027
"...to go back to Drexl and fuck yourself...

196
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,487
"...then go back to Drexl
and fuck yourself."

197
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:36,240
Drexl? What's a Drexl?

198
00:15:36,324 --> 00:15:38,451
Please shut up! I'm trying to come clean.

199
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:42,371
I've been a call girl for exactly four days
and you are my third customer.

200
00:15:42,496 --> 00:15:45,332
I want you to know,
that I am not damaged goods.

201
00:15:45,624 --> 00:15:48,251
I'm not what they call in Florida,
white trash!

202
00:15:48,335 --> 00:15:50,045
I'm a really good person.

203
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:52,839
And when it comes to relationships...

204
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:55,467
...l am one hundred percent.

205
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,263
I am one hundred percent monogamous.

206
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:03,849
You stay with one guy?

207
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:07,645
Exactly. If I'm with you, then I'm with you.

208
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:10,147
And I don't want anybody else.

209
00:16:12,691 --> 00:16:15,069
Now, I got to tell you something else.

210
00:16:15,444 --> 00:16:18,655
When you said last night was one
of the best times you've had...

211
00:16:18,738 --> 00:16:20,573
...did you mean physically?

212
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:23,993
Yeah, yeah. But I'm talking about
the whole night.

213
00:16:24,577 --> 00:16:28,248
I never had as much fun with a girl,
as I had with you, my whole life.

214
00:16:28,374 --> 00:16:31,794
It's true. You like Elvis. You like Janis...

215
00:16:32,044 --> 00:16:35,546
...you like kung fu movies.
You like The Partridge Family...

216
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:39,384
Actually, I don't like The Partridge family.

217
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:41,803
That was part of the act.

218
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:49,687
And I feel really goofy saying this...

219
00:16:50,062 --> 00:16:54,732
...after only knowing you one night,
and me being a call girl and all...

220
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:58,569
But, I think I love you.

221
00:17:06,077 --> 00:17:07,328
Wait a second.

222
00:17:09,913 --> 00:17:13,834
Look, I've been trying to keep
this whole thing in perspective.

223
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:18,005
You just said you loved me. If I say
I love you, throw caution to the wind...

224
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,633
...let the chips fall as they may,
and you're lying, I'll fucking die.

225
00:17:21,717 --> 00:17:25,470
I'm not lying to you.
And I swear from this moment forth...

226
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,598
...l will never lie to you again.

227
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,654
Well, hello, Mrs. Worley.

228
00:17:43,738 --> 00:17:45,155
How do you do, Mr. Worley.

229
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:47,198
Top of the morning to you, Mrs. Worley.

230
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:49,075
Bottom of the ninth, Mr. Worley.

231
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:51,536
By the way, have you seen
your lovely wife today?

232
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,706
My beautiful, charming, sexy wife...

233
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:55,041
...Mrs. Alabama Worley?

234
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:56,917
Why? Are there
any others, Mr. Worley?

235
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:58,169
No, not for me, no.

236
00:17:58,252 --> 00:18:00,254
-No. No.
-Yes, yes.

237
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:12,891
Excuse me. Do you think you could
turn down the heat just a teeny bit?

238
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,313
I must ask you a question.

239
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:19,939
Who and what is a Drexl?

240
00:18:20,022 --> 00:18:22,191
-Shhh.
-Huh?

241
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:24,026
He was my pimp.

242
00:18:24,652 --> 00:18:25,903
You had a pimp?

243
00:18:27,696 --> 00:18:29,698
I was a call girl.

244
00:18:29,782 --> 00:18:31,533
Call girls have pimps.

245
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:33,285
Was he black?

246
00:18:33,494 --> 00:18:37,497
He thinks he is. He said his mama was
an Apache but I suspect he's lying.

247
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,665
Is he nice?

248
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:44,045
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
He treated me pretty decent.

249
00:18:44,587 --> 00:18:48,216
I was only there for four days.
He got a little bit rough the other day.

250
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:51,552
-What do you mean? With you?
-No, with my friend Ilene.

251
00:18:51,886 --> 00:18:53,595
What did he do to Ilene?

252
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,889
Slapped her around.
Kicked her in the stomach.

253
00:18:55,973 --> 00:18:57,224
It was scary.

254
00:18:57,724 --> 00:18:59,893
This motherfucker sounds beautiful.

255
00:19:01,395 --> 00:19:04,732
What did you do to end up
with a son of a bitch like that?

256
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:10,113
What are you talking about?

257
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:12,364
Floyd say he don't be eating pussy.

258
00:19:13,156 --> 00:19:16,994
Drexl, any nigger says he don't eat pussy's
lying his ass off.

259
00:19:17,244 --> 00:19:18,412
I heard that.

260
00:19:18,495 --> 00:19:21,373
Hold on a second.
Big D., you saying you eat pussy?

261
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:24,543
Yeah, motherfucker, I eat the pussy,
I eat the bud.

262
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:26,211
I eat every fucking thing.

263
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:29,839
If I ever did eat any pussy,
I would never eat any pussy, right?

264
00:19:29,922 --> 00:19:32,258
But if I did eat some pussy...

265
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:34,719
...l sure as hell wouldn't tell
no goddamn body.

266
00:19:34,802 --> 00:19:38,639
-I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
-Shit, nigger, you smoke enough Sherm...

267
00:19:38,723 --> 00:19:41,434
...your dumb ass would do
a lot of motherfucking things.

268
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:44,186
You'd be up in there suckin' niggers' dicks!

269
00:19:47,063 --> 00:19:50,359
Fuck you guys, man.
You guys are fucked up, all right?

270
00:19:50,443 --> 00:19:53,279
Hey. Wait a second.
We's just fucking with you.

271
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,284
In fact, I'm going to show you what
I mean with a little demonstration.

272
00:19:58,492 --> 00:19:59,952
Toss me the burner.

273
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,581
All right, dig this.

274
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,336
Pretend it's that fine centerfold bitch.

275
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,715
You know what I'm saying?
And you are you.

276
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,094
-Honey, where you going?
-Bathroom.

277
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,871
<i>-Well, can you live with it?
-What?</i>

278
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,082
<i>I said can you live with it?</i>

279
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,000
Live with what?

280
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,545
<i>That son of a bitch walking around
breathing the same air as you.</i>

281
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,630
<i>Getting away with it every day.</i>

282
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,258
<i>Are you haunted?</i>

283
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,426
Yeah.

284
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,928
<i>You want to get un-haunted?</i>

285
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:46,846
Oh, yeah.

286
00:21:47,096 --> 00:21:48,598
<i>Well, l'd kill him.</i>

287
00:21:49,098 --> 00:21:51,809
Shoot him in the face.
Put him down like a dog.

288
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:54,687
I can't believe what you're saying.

289
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,607
I'm not saying nothing.
I's just saying what I'd do.

290
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,774
You'd do that?

291
00:21:58,858 --> 00:22:00,860
The fuck don't deserve to live.

292
00:22:02,445 --> 00:22:04,571
Look, he's haunting me, you know.

293
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,159
I want to kill him, but I don't want
to spend the rest of my life in jail.

294
00:22:09,242 --> 00:22:10,702
Hey man, I don't blame you.

295
00:22:10,785 --> 00:22:13,747
-If I thought I'd get away with it...
-Get away with it?

296
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,292
Killing is the hard part.
Getting away with it, that's easy.

297
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:20,211
You think a cop gives a fuck about a pimp?

298
00:22:21,462 --> 00:22:24,298
Listen.
Every pimp in the world could get shot.

299
00:22:24,548 --> 00:22:28,302
Two in the back of the fucking head.
Cops would throw a party, man.

300
00:22:31,598 --> 00:22:34,059
As long as you're not at the scene
of the crime...

301
00:22:34,142 --> 00:22:37,812
...with a smoking gun in your hand,
you'll get away with it.

302
00:22:38,395 --> 00:22:39,980
Clarence, I like you.

303
00:22:40,314 --> 00:22:43,442
Always have, always will.

304
00:23:08,091 --> 00:23:09,092
'Bama.

305
00:23:10,093 --> 00:23:11,469
Where you going?

306
00:23:13,805 --> 00:23:16,474
I need you to write down
your former address.

307
00:23:16,891 --> 00:23:17,892
Why?

308
00:23:18,142 --> 00:23:20,979
So I can go over there and
pick up your stuff, that's why.

309
00:23:21,062 --> 00:23:24,816
Oh, baby, come on, Clarence.
I just want to disappear from there.

310
00:23:25,191 --> 00:23:29,237
I know this scares the shit out of you,
but I'm not scared of that motherfucker.

311
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,073
You are completely out of his reach.
He poses absolutely no threat to you.

312
00:23:33,198 --> 00:23:35,117
If he doesn't matter, and he doesn't...

313
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,245
...then it seems silly you lose
all your things now.

314
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:39,414
Listen.

315
00:23:40,582 --> 00:23:42,041
You don't know him.

316
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:45,503
No, you don't know me.
Not when it comes to shit like this.

317
00:23:46,754 --> 00:23:48,171
I need to do this.

318
00:23:48,672 --> 00:23:52,050
I want you to know that you can count
on me to protect you.

319
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:57,598
Come on, please just write it down.

320
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:07,940
This isn't a good idea.

321
00:24:09,108 --> 00:24:10,610
I'm telling you, it'll be fine.

322
00:24:10,693 --> 00:24:12,612
I'll be in and out of there.

323
00:24:15,364 --> 00:24:16,991
-Be careful.
-I will.

324
00:24:21,953 --> 00:24:23,121
I love you.

325
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,706
I love you, too.

326
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:29,769
You want something?

327
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:31,478
Yeah, you Drexl?

328
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:32,980
No man, I'm Marty.

329
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,440
Well, I want to talk to Drexl.

330
00:25:35,524 --> 00:25:38,443
Well, what the fuck you want
to talk to him about?

331
00:25:38,777 --> 00:25:40,237
It's about Alabama.

332
00:25:55,418 --> 00:25:57,337
He was asking about Alabama.

333
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:01,550
Where the fuck is that bitch?

334
00:26:01,633 --> 00:26:02,884
She's with me.

335
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:05,428
Who the fuck are you?

336
00:26:05,886 --> 00:26:07,221
I'm her husband.

337
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:13,894
Well, that makes us practically related.

338
00:26:16,397 --> 00:26:17,481
Have a seat, boy.

339
00:26:17,607 --> 00:26:19,984
Have an egg roll. We got everything here...

340
00:26:20,067 --> 00:26:22,903
...from "Little-Eye Joel"
to "Damned if I know".

341
00:26:23,403 --> 00:26:24,487
No, thanks.

342
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,119
"No, thanks?" What that mean?

343
00:26:33,288 --> 00:26:35,666
I think you're too scared to be eating.

344
00:26:42,464 --> 00:26:43,632
Now, see...

345
00:26:43,757 --> 00:26:46,927
We're sitting down here,
ready to negotiate.

346
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,513
And you've already given up your shit.

347
00:26:50,597 --> 00:26:52,849
I'm still a mystery to you.

348
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:56,102
But I know exactly where
your white ass is coming from.

349
00:26:56,394 --> 00:27:00,022
If I ask you if you want some dinner
and you grab an egg roll...

350
00:27:00,105 --> 00:27:03,275
...l say, he's acting like he ain't got
a care in the world.

351
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,029
And who knows? Maybe he don't.

352
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:10,325
Maybe this fool is such
a bad motherfucker...

353
00:27:10,867 --> 00:27:13,828
...he don't have to worry about nothing.
He just sits down...

354
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:16,080
...and watches my motherfucking TV.

355
00:27:16,372 --> 00:27:17,373
See?

356
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:22,253
You haven't even sat down yet.

357
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:25,464
That TV over there,
since you've been here...

358
00:27:25,547 --> 00:27:28,384
...has a woman with her breast
just hanging out.

359
00:27:28,634 --> 00:27:31,095
Well, you haven't even bothered to look.

360
00:27:31,552 --> 00:27:33,304
You just been clocking me.

361
00:27:37,684 --> 00:27:42,313
Now, I know I'm pretty.
But I'm not as pretty as a couple of titties.

362
00:27:45,984 --> 00:27:48,152
This child be fierce.

363
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:01,707
I'm not eating because I'm not hungry.

364
00:28:01,957 --> 00:28:03,834
I'm not sitting because I'm not staying.

365
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:07,753
I'm not looking at the movie because
I've already seen it seven years ago.

366
00:28:07,837 --> 00:28:08,921
It is The Mack.

367
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:11,549
Max Julian, Carol Speed and Richard Pryor.

368
00:28:12,883 --> 00:28:15,637
I'm not scared of you. I just don't like you.

369
00:28:15,804 --> 00:28:19,308
That's payoff money.
Alabama is moving on to greener pastures.

370
00:28:19,391 --> 00:28:21,518
We're not negotiating, I don't like to barter.

371
00:28:21,602 --> 00:28:23,811
What's in there is for my peace of mind.

372
00:28:23,895 --> 00:28:27,398
My peace of mind is worth that much.
Not one penny more.

373
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:38,534
It's empty.

374
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,756
Marty, you know what we got here?
A motherfucking Charlie Bronson.

375
00:28:55,258 --> 00:28:56,509
Mr. Majestyk?

376
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,803
Look here, Charlie.

377
00:29:01,263 --> 00:29:03,015
None of this bullshit is necessary.

378
00:29:03,098 --> 00:29:05,226
I don't got no hold over Alabama.

379
00:29:06,435 --> 00:29:09,271
I was just trying to lend a girl
a helping hand.

380
00:30:07,953 --> 00:30:09,538
That's what you get.

381
00:30:10,455 --> 00:30:12,624
You fuck with me, white-boy!

382
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:16,211
Look at this!
You fond of my motherfucking freaks?

383
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,130
Shit! You motherfucker!

384
00:30:18,255 --> 00:30:20,007
Your ass got to be crazy!

385
00:30:29,098 --> 00:30:31,642
You must have thought
it was white-boy day.

386
00:30:33,395 --> 00:30:35,230
It ain't white-boy day, is it?

387
00:30:35,314 --> 00:30:37,316
No man, it ain't white-boy day.

388
00:30:38,025 --> 00:30:40,193
Shit man, you done fucked up again.

389
00:30:56,751 --> 00:30:59,294
Well, well, well.

390
00:30:59,711 --> 00:31:01,713
Look what we got here.

391
00:31:03,423 --> 00:31:04,758
Clarence Worley?

392
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:09,429
It sounds almost like a nigger name.

393
00:31:10,722 --> 00:31:12,474
And I know where you live.

394
00:31:12,724 --> 00:31:16,477
4900, 160th Street...

395
00:31:16,685 --> 00:31:18,062
...apartment 48.

396
00:31:19,271 --> 00:31:23,484
And I would make a million-dollar bet,
that Alabama is at the same address.

397
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:27,112
Marty, take the car, go get her.
Bring her dumb ass back here.

398
00:31:28,572 --> 00:31:31,283
I think I'll keep lover boy here entertained.

399
00:31:35,787 --> 00:31:36,871
Hey, Marty!

400
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:38,456
What the fuck are you doing?

401
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:41,751
-I can't find my jacket!
-Go look in the fucking hamper.

402
00:31:51,386 --> 00:31:52,053
You!

403
00:31:52,136 --> 00:31:55,640
Get a bag and put Alabama's things in it.
You want to get fucking shot?

404
00:31:55,723 --> 00:31:58,268
Get a bag and put Alabama's things in it!

405
00:31:58,393 --> 00:32:01,521
I just did you the biggest fucking favor
of your life!

406
00:32:03,064 --> 00:32:04,315
Open your eyes.

407
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:07,318
I said open your fucking eyes!

408
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:11,029
You thought it was pretty fucking funny.
Didn't you?

409
00:32:11,113 --> 00:32:13,991
Fuck you! You piece of shit!

410
00:32:18,662 --> 00:32:20,122
Don't fucking move!

411
00:32:20,581 --> 00:32:23,709
<i>l was selfish. l know l was selfish.
l was, but...</i>

412
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,379
<i>...l was carrying your child, babe.</i>

413
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:41,309
I killed him.

414
00:32:41,976 --> 00:32:44,519
Want a hamburger or something?
I'm starving to death.

415
00:32:44,644 --> 00:32:45,896
Is this a joke?

416
00:32:46,688 --> 00:32:47,689
No joke.

417
00:32:50,317 --> 00:32:53,279
That was the best fucking hamburger
I ever had in my life.

418
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:55,990
I've never had a hamburger taste this good.

419
00:32:56,616 --> 00:32:59,243
Come on, eat something, you'll feel better.

420
00:33:04,497 --> 00:33:07,500
What the fuck you crying for?

421
00:33:08,376 --> 00:33:12,047
He's not worth one of your tears.
Would you rather it have been me?

422
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,592
Is that it? ls that what you want?
I mean, do you love him?

423
00:33:16,051 --> 00:33:17,509
Do you love him?

424
00:33:18,052 --> 00:33:20,095
I said, do you fucking love him?

425
00:33:20,971 --> 00:33:23,099
-I think what you did was...
-What?

426
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,352
-I think what you did...
-What?

427
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,521
...was so romantic.

428
00:33:35,236 --> 00:33:37,071
Oh, baby, you're bleeding.

429
00:33:41,075 --> 00:33:42,993
I got your things right here.

430
00:33:47,248 --> 00:33:48,499
Clean clothes.

431
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,668
I love you.

432
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:52,752
I love you.
There is a God.

433
00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:20,405
These aren't my clothes.

434
00:34:42,134 --> 00:34:45,720
Rommel, where are you?
Come on get in here. Get in here now.

435
00:35:17,251 --> 00:35:18,752
Good morning, Daddy.

436
00:35:19,544 --> 00:35:20,712
Hey, Rommel.

437
00:35:20,962 --> 00:35:22,547
Long time no see, huh?

438
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:32,349
Now you're going to have
to excuse the place.

439
00:35:33,225 --> 00:35:36,310
I haven't exactly been doing
a lot of entertaining...

440
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,562
...of company as of late.

441
00:35:39,855 --> 00:35:42,316
I'm sorry if I seem a little tense.

442
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:47,363
But you're the last person in the world,
that I expected to see this morning.

443
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:51,033
Well, that's okay, Daddy,
I tend to have that effect on people.

444
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,327
You got anything to drink around here?
I'm dying of thirst.

445
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:58,623
Now there should be,
there should be a Seven-Up in there.

446
00:35:58,831 --> 00:36:00,250
Anything stronger?

447
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:04,128
Probably not. Beer.
You can drink beer, can't you?

448
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:07,632
I can, but I don't.

449
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,885
That's about all I ever eat.

450
00:36:14,054 --> 00:36:15,138
Excuse me.

451
00:36:16,306 --> 00:36:17,808
Hello, hello, hello.

452
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:19,644
I'm his father.

453
00:36:21,062 --> 00:36:25,400
Well that's all right. I'm his wife,
Alabama Worley. Pleased to meet you.

454
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,402
We got married.

455
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,672
Lover, why don't you be a sport
and go get us some beer?

456
00:36:48,797 --> 00:36:50,257
You want some beer?

457
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,759
If you want some, it'll be here. Okay?

458
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,553
Where is a liquor store around here?

459
00:36:54,636 --> 00:36:57,097
There is a party store down 54th Street.

460
00:36:58,974 --> 00:37:01,726
Get a six-pack of something imported.

461
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:05,187
Hard to tell you what to get.
Different places have different things.

462
00:37:05,271 --> 00:37:07,565
Here, that should cover it, okee-dokee?

463
00:37:07,648 --> 00:37:09,317
Okee-dokee, Doggy Daddy.

464
00:37:20,452 --> 00:37:24,372
Ain't she the sweetest goddamn thing
you ever saw in your whole life?

465
00:37:24,664 --> 00:37:27,501
I mean, is she a four-alarm fire, or what?

466
00:37:29,295 --> 00:37:30,796
She seems very nice.

467
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:32,882
Nice?

468
00:37:33,341 --> 00:37:36,927
Daddy, "nice" is not the word.
I mean this girl, she's a peach.

469
00:37:37,177 --> 00:37:39,554
You know, she even tastes like a peach.

470
00:37:40,222 --> 00:37:42,933
You can tell I'm in love with her, can't you?

471
00:37:44,517 --> 00:37:46,228
No, wait. I gotta talk.

472
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,607
Sit down! Shut up!

473
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,901
You give me a fucking headache.

474
00:37:54,944 --> 00:37:57,738
You are so much like your mother,
I can't believe it.

475
00:37:57,821 --> 00:38:00,282
You are your fucking mother,
through and through.

476
00:38:00,407 --> 00:38:03,118
I haven't heard from you in three years.

477
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:07,414
You show up all of a sudden,
at 8:00 in the morning...

478
00:38:07,498 --> 00:38:10,251
...you walk in here
like a goddamned bulldozer.

479
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:14,379
Now don't get me wrong.
I love you, I'm glad to see you.

480
00:38:16,256 --> 00:38:18,633
But slow it down, man.

481
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,344
All right?

482
00:38:23,054 --> 00:38:24,055
Now.

483
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:29,268
When did you get married?

484
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:33,939
Daddy...

485
00:38:36,693 --> 00:38:38,903
I'm in big fucking trouble.

486
00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:41,739
I really need your help.

487
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:43,867
No, no, stop talking.

488
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:49,496
-What do you want from me?
-What?

489
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:52,833
What do you want from me?
Stop acting like an infant!

490
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:55,544
You're here because you want me
to help you.

491
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:58,088
What do you need from me?
You need money?

492
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:01,008
No. You still have friends on the force?

493
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:03,175
Yes, I still have friends on the force.

494
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:05,303
Could you find out if they know about us?

495
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:08,389
I don't think they know shit.
But I want to know for sure.

496
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,141
You can do that. Right?

497
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:12,310
What makes you think I could do that?

498
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:13,728
Because you were a cop.

499
00:39:13,811 --> 00:39:16,564
But what makes you think
that I would do that?

500
00:39:17,648 --> 00:39:19,233
Because I'm your son.

501
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,818
Oh, you're my son.

502
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:25,322
Oh, you got it all worked out, don't you?

503
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:30,368
Look. I mean, goddamn,
I've never asked you for a goddamn thing.

504
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,746
Jesus fucking Christ!
After Mom divorced you...

505
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,707
...did I ever ask you for anything?
No. I didn't.

506
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:38,292
When I wouldn't see you
for one or two years...

507
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:39,877
...did I ever get into your shit?

508
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,338
The whole time you were drunk,
did I get mad...

509
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,547
...point my finger?

510
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,635
No! I never did.
Everybody else did, but I didn't!

511
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,639
Now look, I just need help,
and you can fucking help me. All right?

512
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:56,143
Now, I'm basically a resourceful guy.
If I didn't really need it, I wouldn't ask.

513
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,563
I mean, if you want to say no, then fine.

514
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:03,692
Forget it, don't worry about it.
No problem, I'm gone, all right?

515
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:10,867
The Virgin is back!

516
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,246
Thank God. I could eat a horse.

517
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,081
I didn't get you any chicken.

518
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,415
Well, how come?

519
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,044
Honey, it's too early in the morning.
It's only 9:00.

520
00:40:22,127 --> 00:40:23,379
Son of a bitch!

521
00:40:30,343 --> 00:40:32,512
Dick Richie! Dick Richie!

522
00:40:33,263 --> 00:40:34,681
That's me, I'm me.

523
00:40:35,807 --> 00:40:36,808
Come inside.

524
00:40:36,891 --> 00:40:37,892
Okay.

525
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,941
Sit. Sit, sit.

526
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,526
Now.

527
00:40:47,943 --> 00:40:50,320
The part you'll be reading
is one of the bad guys.

528
00:40:50,404 --> 00:40:51,864
There's Brian and Marty.

529
00:40:51,947 --> 00:40:52,781
Who?

530
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:54,909
Is there a problem?

531
00:40:55,118 --> 00:40:56,119
No.

532
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:58,580
Peter Breck has been cast
in the part of Brian.

533
00:40:58,663 --> 00:41:01,124
So, you'll be reading for the role of Marty.

534
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:05,502
In this scene, you're both in a car,
and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.

535
00:41:05,794 --> 00:41:07,963
What you want to do is get him off.

536
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:10,632
All right, I'm Marty.

537
00:41:12,092 --> 00:41:13,093
Ready?

538
00:41:16,305 --> 00:41:17,472
I'm driving.

539
00:41:18,307 --> 00:41:19,224
Okay.

540
00:41:20,308 --> 00:41:21,893
"Where the fuck did he come from?"

541
00:41:21,976 --> 00:41:24,312
"l don't know,
he just appeared like magic."

542
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:27,315
"Well, don't just sit there, shoot him!"

543
00:41:28,274 --> 00:41:29,275
"Get him!"

544
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:30,943
Thank you, Mr. Richie.

545
00:41:31,277 --> 00:41:33,946
I'm very impressed.
You're a very fine actor.

546
00:41:35,448 --> 00:41:36,532
Thank you.

547
00:41:37,283 --> 00:41:38,366
Thank you.

548
00:41:38,825 --> 00:41:40,285
We'll let you know.

549
00:41:40,994 --> 00:41:41,912
Okay.

550
00:41:42,245 --> 00:41:44,497
-Okay, one-handed.
-One hand.

551
00:41:45,749 --> 00:41:47,250
Good, try on the other one there.

552
00:41:47,334 --> 00:41:48,877
Here comes the train.

553
00:41:58,928 --> 00:42:03,934
Well, they found nothing.
In fact, they think it's drug related.

554
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,937
Drug related? Why drug related?

555
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,232
Well, apparently Drexl had his
big toe stuck in that shit.

556
00:42:10,315 --> 00:42:11,316
Really?

557
00:42:11,525 --> 00:42:14,985
Drexl had an association
with a fellow named Blue Lou Boyle.

558
00:42:15,611 --> 00:42:17,988
-Name mean anything to you?
-No.

559
00:42:18,197 --> 00:42:20,866
If you don't hang around his circle,
it shouldn't.

560
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:21,784
Who is he?

561
00:42:21,867 --> 00:42:24,537
Gangster, drug dealer.
You don't want him on your ass.

562
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:28,874
Now look, Clarence, the more I hear
about this Drexl fucker...

563
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:33,711
...the more I think you did the right thing.
This guy was not just some wild flake.

564
00:42:33,795 --> 00:42:37,840
That's what I was trying to tell you before.
The guy was like a mad dog.

565
00:42:39,217 --> 00:42:42,345
So, the cops, they don't think...
They're not after us?

566
00:42:42,428 --> 00:42:44,722
No. Until they hear something better...

567
00:42:44,806 --> 00:42:48,267
...they will just assume Drexl
had a falling out with Blue Lou.

568
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:52,521
And once you leave town,
I wouldn't even worry about it.

569
00:42:53,689 --> 00:42:57,150
Thanks, thanks a lot, Daddy.
You really came through for me.

570
00:42:59,486 --> 00:43:01,321
I got some money I could give you.

571
00:43:01,405 --> 00:43:03,031
No, keep it. Keep it.

572
00:43:04,323 --> 00:43:05,575
Well now, son.

573
00:43:07,034 --> 00:43:08,828
I want you to know that...

574
00:43:09,704 --> 00:43:12,833
...l hope everything works out
with you and Alabama.

575
00:43:13,876 --> 00:43:14,960
I like her.

576
00:43:16,753 --> 00:43:19,965
And I think you make a real cute couple.

577
00:43:22,884 --> 00:43:25,136
Yeah, well, you stay out of trouble.

578
00:43:27,555 --> 00:43:31,143
You got a wife to think about now.

579
00:43:32,895 --> 00:43:34,396
Quit fucking around.

580
00:43:37,399 --> 00:43:38,400
Son...

581
00:43:41,277 --> 00:43:42,528
...l love you.

582
00:43:51,787 --> 00:43:52,872
All right.

583
00:43:54,582 --> 00:43:58,793
This is my friend Dick Richie's
number and address in Hollywood.

584
00:43:59,294 --> 00:44:01,671
That's where we'll be.

585
00:44:01,755 --> 00:44:02,839
All right.

586
00:44:03,131 --> 00:44:06,301
Come on, Alabama. We're taking off.
Kiss Pops goodbye.

587
00:44:09,846 --> 00:44:12,390
Bye, Daddy. Hope to see you again soon.

588
00:44:15,768 --> 00:44:16,852
Hey, hey!

589
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:19,063
What kind of smackaroo is that?

590
00:44:23,068 --> 00:44:25,028
I'll send you a postcard from Hollywood.

591
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:26,488
Alabama.

592
00:44:26,738 --> 00:44:27,822
Yes, sir?

593
00:44:27,989 --> 00:44:29,366
Take care of him for me.

594
00:44:29,449 --> 00:44:31,992
Don't worry, Daddy.
I'll keep him on a short leash.

595
00:44:32,076 --> 00:44:36,163
As the sun sets slowly in the west,
we bid you a fine farewell.

596
00:44:43,879 --> 00:44:47,341
Son of a bitch was right.
She tastes like a peach.

597
00:44:48,132 --> 00:44:49,300
Come on, Rommel.

598
00:44:49,384 --> 00:44:51,344
Come on boy.

599
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:08,277
Hello.

600
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,070
Hello, baby!

601
00:45:10,529 --> 00:45:11,488
Clarence?

602
00:45:11,572 --> 00:45:12,656
You got it!

603
00:45:12,823 --> 00:45:15,075
It's great to hear from you!
What's going on?

604
00:45:15,158 --> 00:45:17,286
Well, you're going to be seeing me shortly.

605
00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:19,288
You're coming to L.A.!
When?

606
00:45:20,163 --> 00:45:21,164
Tomorrow.

607
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,500
There's a story behind the letter.

608
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:27,587
By the way, I won't be alone.
I'm bringing my lovely wife.

609
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:30,298
Get the fuck out of here.
Clarence, you got married?

610
00:45:30,381 --> 00:45:32,134
I'm a married man, buddy.

611
00:45:32,885 --> 00:45:35,596
You want to say hello to my better half?
Come here.

612
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:37,347
Hi, Dick. This is Alabama Worley.

613
00:45:37,431 --> 00:45:39,557
How you doing, Alabama Worley?

614
00:45:40,766 --> 00:45:43,811
Clarence told me about you.
He said you're his best friend.

615
00:45:43,895 --> 00:45:47,231
-So, that makes you my best friend too.
-Tell him we got to go.

616
00:45:47,315 --> 00:45:49,150
Clarence says we got to go.

617
00:45:49,525 --> 00:45:51,277
Wait, can I speak to Clarence?

618
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,738
-Ask him if he got it.
-Did you get the letter?

619
00:45:53,821 --> 00:45:54,739
What letter?

620
00:45:54,822 --> 00:45:57,032
-What letter?
-Letters.

621
00:45:57,449 --> 00:45:58,909
I didn't get any letter.

622
00:45:58,992 --> 00:46:00,827
Has he gotten his mail yet?

623
00:46:00,911 --> 00:46:03,747
-Have you gotten your mail?
-No, my roommate, Floyd...

624
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:07,125
-Has he looked through it?
-Have you looked through it?

625
00:46:09,628 --> 00:46:11,463
Tell him to go look through it.

626
00:46:11,546 --> 00:46:13,298
Go and look through it.

627
00:46:14,215 --> 00:46:17,134
Wait, wait, wait.
Can I speak to Clarence, please?

628
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:19,720
He wants to talk to you.

629
00:46:19,803 --> 00:46:22,806
No tiempo. Tell him we got to go.
Tell him, "Read the letter."

630
00:46:23,057 --> 00:46:23,933
Read the letter.

631
00:46:24,016 --> 00:46:26,894
Tell him I love him
and that as of tomorrow.

632
00:46:26,977 --> 00:46:28,354
Honey, hold this.

633
00:46:28,979 --> 00:46:30,481
As of tomorrow...

634
00:46:30,564 --> 00:46:33,483
...all your money problems gonna be over.

635
00:46:35,318 --> 00:46:37,195
Hello? What money problems?

636
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:40,491
Bye-bye.

637
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,703
Hello?

638
00:46:58,259 --> 00:46:59,260
Floyd!

639
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:02,429
Floyd, you used up the last piece
of toilet paper.

640
00:47:23,365 --> 00:47:24,616
Hey! Rommel!

641
00:47:25,534 --> 00:47:27,619
Hey, come here! Rommel!

642
00:47:48,891 --> 00:47:49,892
Frankie.

643
00:47:50,058 --> 00:47:52,686
Tell Luca to go outside
and do you know what.

644
00:48:01,777 --> 00:48:03,905
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?

645
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:07,491
I give up. Who are you?

646
00:48:08,743 --> 00:48:12,413
The anti-Christ.
You got me in a vendetta kind of mood.

647
00:48:13,331 --> 00:48:14,789
You can tell the angels...

648
00:48:14,873 --> 00:48:17,209
...you never saw evil
so singularly personified...

649
00:48:17,292 --> 00:48:19,836
...as in the face of the man who killed you.

650
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,840
My name is Vincent Coccotti.
I work as counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle.

651
00:48:23,924 --> 00:48:25,842
The man your son stole from.

652
00:48:27,093 --> 00:48:30,847
I hear you were once a cop, so I can
assume you have heard of us before.

653
00:48:30,931 --> 00:48:32,097
Am I correct?

654
00:48:32,806 --> 00:48:34,767
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.

655
00:48:35,476 --> 00:48:39,730
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up
the how-full-of-shit-am-I question...

656
00:48:39,813 --> 00:48:42,066
...you been asking yourself.

657
00:48:43,984 --> 00:48:45,736
We're going to have a little Q and A.

658
00:48:45,819 --> 00:48:48,656
And at the risk of sounding redundant,
please...

659
00:48:48,822 --> 00:48:50,740
...make your answers genuine.

660
00:48:51,908 --> 00:48:53,409
Want a Chesterfield?

661
00:48:54,118 --> 00:48:54,953
No.

662
00:48:56,329 --> 00:48:58,958
I have a son of my own,
about your boy's age.

663
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,379
I can imagine how painful
this must be for you.

664
00:49:03,462 --> 00:49:04,713
But Clarence...

665
00:49:05,422 --> 00:49:08,550
...and his bitch of a girlfriend,
brought this on themselves.

666
00:49:08,633 --> 00:49:11,511
I implore you not to go down that road
with them.

667
00:49:12,303 --> 00:49:15,974
You could always take comfort
in the fact you never had a choice.

668
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:19,185
I'd like to help you if I could...

669
00:49:19,269 --> 00:49:21,354
...but I haven't seen Clarence.

670
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:27,317
You see that?

671
00:49:30,028 --> 00:49:33,156
That smarts doesn't it?
To get slammed in the nose.

672
00:49:34,575 --> 00:49:37,786
Fucks you up. You get the pain
shooting through your brain...

673
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,913
...your eyes fill up with water.

674
00:49:40,372 --> 00:49:42,123
It's not any kind of fun.

675
00:49:42,498 --> 00:49:46,252
But, what I have to offer you,
that's as good as it's going to get.

676
00:49:47,336 --> 00:49:49,714
And it won't ever get that good again.

677
00:49:50,423 --> 00:49:53,259
We talked to your neighbors.
They saw a Cadillac.

678
00:49:55,386 --> 00:49:56,762
Purple Cadillac.

679
00:49:57,346 --> 00:50:01,266
Clarence's purple Cadillac,
parked in front of your trailer yesterday.

680
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:03,393
Mr. Worley.

681
00:50:04,227 --> 00:50:05,896
Have you seen your son?

682
00:50:06,521 --> 00:50:07,773
I've seen him.

683
00:50:08,399 --> 00:50:10,860
I can't be sure of how much he told you.

684
00:50:10,985 --> 00:50:13,696
In the chance you're in the dark
about some of this...

685
00:50:13,779 --> 00:50:17,617
...let me shed some light.
That whore your boy hangs around with...

686
00:50:17,783 --> 00:50:20,244
Her pimp is an associate of mine.

687
00:50:21,037 --> 00:50:24,498
Along with other affairs
he works for me in a courier capacity.

688
00:50:24,582 --> 00:50:26,334
Well, apparently...

689
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:30,546
...that dirty whore found out
we were going to do some business...

690
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:34,883
...because your son, the cowboy and
his flame, came into the room blazing...

691
00:50:34,966 --> 00:50:38,720
...and didn't stop, until they were
pretty sure everybody was dead.

692
00:50:40,388 --> 00:50:42,182
What are you talking about?

693
00:50:42,641 --> 00:50:45,936
I'm talking about a massacre.
They snatched my narcotics.

694
00:50:47,229 --> 00:50:49,898
Hightailed it out of there.
Would have got away with it.

695
00:50:49,981 --> 00:50:52,733
But your son, fuckhead that he is...

696
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:56,487
...left his driver's license
in the dead guy's hand.

697
00:51:00,074 --> 00:51:00,991
You know.

698
00:51:01,075 --> 00:51:02,576
I don't believe you.

699
00:51:03,285 --> 00:51:04,620
That's of minor importance.

700
00:51:04,703 --> 00:51:07,956
What's of major fucking importance
is that I believe you.

701
00:51:09,624 --> 00:51:11,125
Where did they go?

702
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:13,294
On their honeymoon.

703
00:51:19,802 --> 00:51:22,721
I'm getting angry asking the same question
a second time.

704
00:51:22,805 --> 00:51:23,681
Where did they go?

705
00:51:23,764 --> 00:51:27,267
They didn't tell me.
Now wait a minute and listen to me.

706
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:29,727
I haven't seen Clarence in three years.

707
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:32,522
He shows up yesterday...

708
00:51:32,647 --> 00:51:35,525
...with a young girl,
saying that he got married.

709
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:40,655
He asked for some quick cash...

710
00:51:42,489 --> 00:51:46,535
...to go on a honeymoon.
He asked me if he could borrow $ 500.

711
00:51:48,328 --> 00:51:50,038
I felt like helping him.

712
00:51:50,205 --> 00:51:53,876
So, I wrote him out a check.
We went to breakfast in the morning.

713
00:51:55,836 --> 00:51:58,172
And that's the last I saw of him...

714
00:51:59,214 --> 00:52:00,631
...so help me God.

715
00:52:02,133 --> 00:52:05,178
They never thought to tell me
where they were going.

716
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,264
And I never thought to ask.

717
00:52:31,662 --> 00:52:32,914
<i>Vincenzo, sir.</i>

718
00:52:33,706 --> 00:52:35,290
<i>There's nothing there.</i>

719
00:52:37,459 --> 00:52:38,835
<i>That's not good.</i>

720
00:52:40,587 --> 00:52:41,671
You know.

721
00:52:42,964 --> 00:52:45,884
Sicilians are great liars.

722
00:52:47,469 --> 00:52:49,054
The best in the world.

723
00:52:51,388 --> 00:52:52,723
I'm Sicilian...

724
00:52:52,806 --> 00:52:56,644
...my father was the world heavyweight
champion of Sicilian liars.

725
00:52:58,229 --> 00:53:01,148
From growing up with him,
I learned the pantomime.

726
00:53:01,899 --> 00:53:04,818
There are 17 different things
a guy can do when he lies...

727
00:53:04,902 --> 00:53:07,988
...to give himself away.
A guy has got 17 pantomimes.

728
00:53:08,404 --> 00:53:10,949
Woman has got 20. Guy has got 17. But...

729
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:14,160
...if you know them,
like you know your own face...

730
00:53:14,244 --> 00:53:17,080
...they would beat lie detectors all to hell.

731
00:53:17,163 --> 00:53:20,083
Now what we got here
is a game of "Show and Tell."

732
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:24,087
You don't want to show me nothing.
But you're telling me everything.

733
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:27,840
I know you know where they are.
So, tell me...

734
00:53:28,715 --> 00:53:31,760
...before I do some damage
you won't walk away from.

735
00:53:34,931 --> 00:53:37,684
Could I have one
of those Chesterfields now?

736
00:53:40,354 --> 00:53:41,230
Sure.

737
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:48,611
You got a...

738
00:53:49,654 --> 00:53:52,490
...match? No wait.
Don't bother, I got one.

739
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:04,751
You're Sicilian, huh?

740
00:54:06,003 --> 00:54:07,337
Yeah, Sicilian.

741
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:12,509
You know...

742
00:54:14,636 --> 00:54:15,804
I read a lot.

743
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,764
Especially things about history.

744
00:54:20,975 --> 00:54:22,935
I find that shit fascinating.

745
00:54:25,062 --> 00:54:27,607
Here's a fact, whether you know it or not.

746
00:54:31,861 --> 00:54:35,197
Sicilians were spawned by niggers.

747
00:54:43,205 --> 00:54:44,373
Come again?

748
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:49,295
It's a fact. Yeah. You see...

749
00:54:50,129 --> 00:54:53,965
...Sicilians have black blood
pumping through their hearts.

750
00:54:55,926 --> 00:54:59,095
And if you don't believe me,
you can look it up.

751
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:02,307
Hundreds and hundreds of years ago,
you see...

752
00:55:02,849 --> 00:55:06,686
...the Moors conquered Sicily.
And the Moors are niggers.

753
00:55:08,813 --> 00:55:10,564
You see, way back then...

754
00:55:11,357 --> 00:55:14,193
...Sicilians were like wops
from northern ltaly.

755
00:55:15,277 --> 00:55:17,571
They all had blond hair and blue eyes.

756
00:55:17,655 --> 00:55:18,823
But, well...

757
00:55:20,908 --> 00:55:22,952
Then the Moors moved in there...

758
00:55:24,912 --> 00:55:27,038
...they changed the whole country.

759
00:55:27,288 --> 00:55:31,376
They did so much fucking
with Sicilian women.

760
00:55:32,377 --> 00:55:35,088
That they changed
the whole bloodline forever.

761
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:38,716
That is why blond hair, blue eyes...

762
00:55:38,967 --> 00:55:42,136
...became black hair and dark skin.

763
00:55:43,221 --> 00:55:46,431
You know it's absolutely amazing to me...

764
00:55:48,642 --> 00:55:50,394
...to think to this day...

765
00:55:50,477 --> 00:55:52,480
...hundreds of years later...

766
00:55:54,482 --> 00:55:56,150
...that Sicilians...

767
00:55:57,235 --> 00:55:59,279
...still carry that nigger gene.

768
00:56:01,238 --> 00:56:02,781
Now this...

769
00:56:02,865 --> 00:56:05,075
No, I am quoting history.

770
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:09,830
It's written, it's a fact.
It's written.

771
00:56:10,622 --> 00:56:11,957
I love this guy!

772
00:56:17,713 --> 00:56:19,505
Your ancestors are niggers.

773
00:56:22,091 --> 00:56:22,967
Hey!

774
00:56:26,304 --> 00:56:28,264
And your great, great, great...

775
00:56:28,347 --> 00:56:30,892
...great grandmother fucked a nigger.

776
00:56:33,477 --> 00:56:36,313
And she had a half-nigger kid. Now...

777
00:56:37,647 --> 00:56:40,525
...if that is a fact, tell me?

778
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,028
Am I lying?

779
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:48,533
'Cause you...

780
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:53,037
...you are part eggplant.

781
00:57:04,133 --> 00:57:05,676
You are a cantaloupe.

782
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:18,063
That was beautiful.

783
00:57:40,292 --> 00:57:42,086
I haven't killed anybody...

784
00:57:43,003 --> 00:57:44,421
...since 1984.

785
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:50,510
Go to this comedian's son's apartment.

786
00:57:51,219 --> 00:57:54,806
Come back with something that tells me
where that asshole went.

787
00:57:55,348 --> 00:57:57,517
So I can wipe this egg off my face.

788
00:58:11,156 --> 00:58:13,324
Fix this fucked-up family for good.

789
00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:20,372
Hey, Boss.

790
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,333
Get ready to be happy.

791
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:29,381
<i>'Morning, everybody. lt's 6:22 here in LA.
l'm David Perry at KBLU.</i>

792
00:58:46,647 --> 00:58:49,108
Hello?

793
00:58:54,613 --> 00:58:55,614
Floyd.

794
00:58:59,201 --> 00:59:01,745
Can't you answer the door at least for me?

795
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:03,872
Oh, man, I didn't even hear it.

796
00:59:04,706 --> 00:59:05,790
Hello?

797
00:59:06,082 --> 00:59:08,293
Can't you help me every now and then?

798
00:59:08,376 --> 00:59:10,212
Yes.

799
00:59:11,837 --> 00:59:13,839
-You call for a date?
-Huh?

800
00:59:16,592 --> 00:59:18,010
I knew it was you!

801
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,973
Dick, this is Alabama.
Alabama, this is Dick.

802
00:59:22,057 --> 00:59:23,225
Nice to meet you!

803
00:59:23,308 --> 00:59:25,602
-How long have you lived here?
-I'm Alabama.

804
00:59:25,685 --> 00:59:28,021
-You look good!
-This is a great place.

805
00:59:28,104 --> 00:59:30,147
I'm starving.
Let's get something to eat.

806
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:32,066
-Who's this?
-This is Floyd.

807
00:59:32,566 --> 00:59:34,068
Let's go! Come on!

808
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:38,405
Hey.

809
00:59:52,752 --> 00:59:54,337
Hey. I didn't tell you guys yet?

810
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:58,341
I had this really, really good audition
for T.J. Hooker the other day.

811
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:02,220
-You're going to be on T.J. Hooker?
-Yeah, the new T.J. Hooker.

812
01:00:02,303 --> 01:00:03,303
Knock on wood.

813
01:00:03,428 --> 01:00:06,974
-You get to meet Captain Kirk?
-You don't meet him in the audition...

814
01:00:07,057 --> 01:00:09,518
...but if I get the part, hope, hope...

815
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:12,855
-That would be amazing.
-It'd be cool...

816
01:00:12,938 --> 01:00:15,482
Meeting Captain Kirk, that would be cool.

817
01:00:25,575 --> 01:00:26,743
Here we are.

818
01:00:29,622 --> 01:00:31,124
The honeymoon suite.

819
01:00:34,043 --> 01:00:35,587
You're really in love, aren't you?

820
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:39,756
For the very first time in my life.
Know what that's like?

821
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,632
No.

822
01:00:42,634 --> 01:00:43,302
No.

823
01:00:43,385 --> 01:00:44,761
Shut the fuck up.

824
01:00:45,012 --> 01:00:47,389
What are you doing in LA anyway, huh?

825
01:00:53,145 --> 01:00:56,898
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
This shit can't be real.

826
01:00:58,316 --> 01:01:00,318
-It'll get you high.
-What?

827
01:01:00,568 --> 01:01:01,903
I said, it'll get you high.

828
01:01:01,986 --> 01:01:03,404
Hey, we got cable.

829
01:01:04,489 --> 01:01:05,740
Want some wine, sweetheart?

830
01:01:05,823 --> 01:01:08,868
Yeah, just a little bit,
I'm not much of a wine gal.

831
01:01:10,036 --> 01:01:11,829
That stuff is fucking real.

832
01:01:12,412 --> 01:01:13,914
This is fucking real, Clarence.

833
01:01:13,997 --> 01:01:15,499
I certainly hope so.

834
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:18,543
You've got a hell of a lot
of cocaine here, man.

835
01:01:18,668 --> 01:01:19,669
I know.

836
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,005
Do you realize how much coke you have?

837
01:01:22,088 --> 01:01:23,256
No, tell me.

838
01:01:24,549 --> 01:01:26,843
I don't know, but it's a fucking lot!

839
01:01:27,844 --> 01:01:30,012
This is Drexl's coke.

840
01:01:30,429 --> 01:01:32,890
No, Drexl is dead, you see.
It's Clarence's coke.

841
01:01:33,015 --> 01:01:36,936
And he can do whatever he wants with it.
What Clarence wants to do is to sell it.

842
01:01:37,061 --> 01:01:40,732
Then, we'll jump on a plane and spend
the rest of our lives spending it.

843
01:01:40,857 --> 01:01:43,610
You got my letter?
You lined up a buyer for me?

844
01:01:43,693 --> 01:01:45,195
I'm not Joe Cocaine, okay?

845
01:01:45,278 --> 01:01:46,363
You're an actor.

846
01:01:46,487 --> 01:01:49,114
I hear these Hollywood guys
get it delivered to the set.

847
01:01:49,198 --> 01:01:51,450
Well, they do. All right? They do.

848
01:01:51,575 --> 01:01:53,786
Maybe one day,
when I'm a successful actor...

849
01:01:53,869 --> 01:01:55,454
...l'll be like one of them.

850
01:01:55,538 --> 01:01:58,332
But, until that day,
I don't have anything. All right?

851
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:01,210
I don't have a pot to piss in,
or a window to throw it out.

852
01:02:01,293 --> 01:02:02,837
All I got is fucking Floyd.

853
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,214
If you want me to help you sell
a bit at a time that's all I can do.

854
01:02:06,297 --> 01:02:08,466
No. None of that bit-at-a-time shit.

855
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:11,469
It's got to be the whole enchilada
in one shot.

856
01:02:11,553 --> 01:02:14,347
Clarence, do you have any idea
how difficult that'll be?

857
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:16,141
What the fuck you are talking about?

858
01:02:16,224 --> 01:02:19,853
I'm offering $ 500,000 worth of white
for $ 200,000. That'll be difficult?

859
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:23,522
Very difficult.
That's very difficult, understand? Listen.

860
01:02:23,605 --> 01:02:27,359
It's difficult because you're selling
to a particular group, understand?

861
01:02:27,484 --> 01:02:30,821
Fat cats, big shots.
Guys who can afford $ 200,000.

862
01:02:31,113 --> 01:02:33,657
Guys who can use a whole suitcase
full of cocaine.

863
01:02:33,782 --> 01:02:35,826
Basically, Clarence,
guys I don't know.

864
01:02:35,909 --> 01:02:39,745
And guys you don't know. And more
importantly, they don't know you.

865
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:45,126
Come on, Dick.

866
01:02:50,716 --> 01:02:51,967
Okay, Clarence.

867
01:02:52,342 --> 01:02:53,802
Listen.

868
01:02:55,262 --> 01:02:57,096
There's one guy that I know...

869
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:59,432
...that can help you out, Clarence, but...

870
01:02:59,515 --> 01:03:01,976
...l'm not guaranteeing you anything.

871
01:03:02,602 --> 01:03:03,978
Is he big-league?

872
01:03:05,438 --> 01:03:07,773
He's not big-league. Okay?

873
01:03:08,357 --> 01:03:12,695
But he works as an assistant to a very
big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.

874
01:03:13,445 --> 01:03:15,363
Lee Donowitz could afford...

875
01:03:15,489 --> 01:03:18,116
...and can use, $ 200,000-worth of coke.

876
01:03:18,992 --> 01:03:21,077
Being that that's what you have.

877
01:03:21,161 --> 01:03:23,413
All right, so what did you tell him?

878
01:03:23,997 --> 01:03:26,041
What the fuck do you expect me
to tell him?

879
01:03:26,124 --> 01:03:28,585
I didn't know what was bullshit
and what wasn't.

880
01:03:28,668 --> 01:03:32,254
And besides, Floyd smoked
the second page of the letter. Okay?

881
01:03:33,005 --> 01:03:35,216
What's this acting-class guy's name?

882
01:03:35,633 --> 01:03:36,634
Elliot.

883
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,928
Elliot what?

884
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:40,471
Elliot Blitzer.

885
01:03:41,764 --> 01:03:44,225
We'll get him on the phone
and arrange a meeting...

886
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:48,353
...so we can get through all this
getting-to-know-you stuff, all right?

887
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:49,729
Where?

888
01:03:50,481 --> 01:03:52,024
Where should we meet?

889
01:03:55,277 --> 01:03:56,154
Roller coaster.

890
01:03:56,238 --> 01:03:57,572
Roller coasters.

891
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,205
So, you have $ 500,000-worth of cola
that you are unloading for $ 200,000.

892
01:04:08,582 --> 01:04:10,376
You want an animal cracker?

893
01:04:11,585 --> 01:04:12,586
Thanks.

894
01:04:13,629 --> 01:04:15,881
Wait, save the gorillas.

895
01:04:19,552 --> 01:04:20,553
Thanks.

896
01:04:20,845 --> 01:04:22,345
So, you got...

897
01:04:23,054 --> 01:04:24,931
...$ 500,000-worth of cola...

898
01:04:25,098 --> 01:04:27,475
...that you're unloading for $ 200,000.

899
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:31,646
"Unloading." That's a hell of a way
to describe a bargain of a lifetime.

900
01:04:32,147 --> 01:04:34,774
-Where did you get it?
-Where did I get it?

901
01:04:36,067 --> 01:04:39,153
I grow it on my windowsill.
The light is really good there.

902
01:04:39,236 --> 01:04:42,573
I'm up high enough off the street so,
you know, you can't see it.

903
01:04:42,656 --> 01:04:43,824
It works perfectly.

904
01:04:43,907 --> 01:04:44,908
Yeah.

905
01:04:46,743 --> 01:04:49,079
Where, really, where does it come from?

906
01:04:49,163 --> 01:04:50,497
Where does it come from?

907
01:04:50,581 --> 01:04:51,665
Coco leaves.

908
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:53,417
You're sick. I'm out of here.

909
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,002
Elliot, chill out.

910
01:04:55,085 --> 01:04:57,170
Come on, sit down here. All right?

911
01:04:57,253 --> 01:04:59,172
We're here, so let's enjoy the ride.

912
01:04:59,255 --> 01:05:02,049
I'll tell you.
You have to promise you'll keep it quiet.

913
01:05:02,133 --> 01:05:06,054
If Dick hadn't told me you're good people,
I'd say it's none of your business.

914
01:05:06,138 --> 01:05:07,848
This is going to be fun.

915
01:05:08,765 --> 01:05:09,850
Let's go!

916
01:05:10,684 --> 01:05:13,978
The truth of the matter is this:
I got a friend in the department.

917
01:05:14,061 --> 01:05:15,146
What department?

918
01:05:15,271 --> 01:05:17,982
What department?
What do you think, eight ball?

919
01:05:19,609 --> 01:05:20,776
The police department?

920
01:05:20,902 --> 01:05:23,696
Give the man a prize!
About a year and a half ago...

921
01:05:23,779 --> 01:05:25,948
...my friend got access
to the evidence room.

922
01:05:26,032 --> 01:05:28,868
He snagged this coke, but he's a good cop
with a family.

923
01:05:28,951 --> 01:05:32,370
He had it for a year and a half
'til he found a guy he could trust.

924
01:05:32,454 --> 01:05:33,455
And he trusts you?

925
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:37,417
He trusts me, we were in 4-H together.
We've known each other since childhood.

926
01:05:37,542 --> 01:05:39,628
I handle sales, he's my silent partner.

927
01:05:39,711 --> 01:05:42,380
He knows, if I get fucked up,
I won't drop dime on him.

928
01:05:42,464 --> 01:05:44,216
Okay? No further, you understand?

929
01:05:44,299 --> 01:05:46,760
He's kind of paranoid,
I didn't tell you nothing.

930
01:05:46,843 --> 01:05:49,512
-You didn't hear anything.
-I didn't hear anything.

931
01:05:49,595 --> 01:05:51,305
All right! Here we go!

932
01:05:57,144 --> 01:05:58,562
Ride it out, baby!

933
01:06:09,072 --> 01:06:10,073
Yeah!

934
01:06:11,115 --> 01:06:14,203
We're going in for another one!
Hang on, Elliot!

935
01:06:29,259 --> 01:06:32,679
Oh, yeah, we got this puppy.
This was a good idea.

936
01:06:39,811 --> 01:06:41,728
Elliot looks a little green.

937
01:06:47,025 --> 01:06:49,987
Do I look like a beautiful blond
with big tits and an ass...

938
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:52,781
...that tastes like French-vanilla ice cream?

939
01:06:53,824 --> 01:06:54,741
What?

940
01:06:54,825 --> 01:06:58,286
I said, do I look like a beautiful
blond with big tits and an ass...

941
01:06:58,369 --> 01:07:00,580
...that tastes like French-vanilla ice cream?

942
01:07:00,663 --> 01:07:01,497
No.

943
01:07:01,664 --> 01:07:03,833
No. Then why are you telling me
this bullshit?

944
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:05,877
What, do you want to fuck me?

945
01:07:06,169 --> 01:07:07,253
Clarence.

946
01:07:07,378 --> 01:07:08,546
He's sick, man.

947
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,465
Let me handle this, all right?

948
01:07:10,548 --> 01:07:12,633
Look. You know what?
Just get it straight.

949
01:07:12,717 --> 01:07:16,053
Lee is not into taking risks, okay?

950
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:20,349
He's got a couple of guys,
he's been dealing with them for years.

951
01:07:21,476 --> 01:07:24,646
They're reliable, they're dependable,
and they're safe.

952
01:07:25,814 --> 01:07:27,441
"Riddle me this, Batman."

953
01:07:27,524 --> 01:07:30,152
If you're so much in love,
what are you doing here?

954
01:07:30,235 --> 01:07:34,739
I'm sure you've got better things to do
than hanging around on a roller coaster.

955
01:07:35,239 --> 01:07:38,201
Your guy is interested because
with that much shit...

956
01:07:38,284 --> 01:07:41,412
...he could play Joe-fucking-Hollywood
until the wheels come off.

957
01:07:41,496 --> 01:07:43,289
He can sell it, he can snort it...

958
01:07:43,372 --> 01:07:45,833
...he can play Santa Claus with it.

959
01:07:45,917 --> 01:07:49,044
At the price he's paying
he'll be able to throw it around.

960
01:07:49,127 --> 01:07:51,254
He'll be everybody's best friend.

961
01:07:51,588 --> 01:07:53,131
I'm not putting him down.

962
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,258
It's his money, let him do what he wants.

963
01:07:55,342 --> 01:07:57,427
But don't expect us to hang around...

964
01:07:57,511 --> 01:08:00,597
...waiting for you guys
to grow some guts, all right?

965
01:08:00,889 --> 01:08:01,681
Jesus.

966
01:08:04,476 --> 01:08:05,644
Yeah, hello.

967
01:08:06,519 --> 01:08:07,353
Hi, Lee.

968
01:08:07,436 --> 01:08:11,106
Elliot, it's Sunday. Can you tell me
why I'm talking to you on Sunday?

969
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:13,859
Don't I see enough of you all week?

970
01:08:13,943 --> 01:08:17,613
I'm with that party that you wanted me
to get together with, Lee.

971
01:08:17,863 --> 01:08:19,198
You know who I'm talking about?

972
01:08:19,281 --> 01:08:21,909
I don't believe this.
Why are you talking to me...

973
01:08:21,992 --> 01:08:23,785
...on my phone about that?

974
01:08:23,952 --> 01:08:28,623
Well, because I'm standing with the guy,
and he insists on talking to you.

975
01:08:29,082 --> 01:08:31,459
What, are you out of your fucking mind?

976
01:08:33,921 --> 01:08:37,591
He said that if I didn't get you
on the phone, that he would leave...

977
01:08:37,716 --> 01:08:40,469
Hello, Lee, it's Clarence. At last, we speak.

978
01:08:40,803 --> 01:08:43,263
First, I want to tell you
I'm a big fan of yours.

979
01:08:43,346 --> 01:08:45,723
<i>That's why I want to open
Dr. Zhivago in LA.</i>

980
01:08:45,807 --> 01:08:48,810
And I need you and your abilities
to distribute it.

981
01:08:51,271 --> 01:08:52,272
I don't know.

982
01:08:52,355 --> 01:08:54,357
<i>Dr. Zhivago is a pretty big movie.</i>

983
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:58,027
The biggest movie you've dealt with.
We're talking a lot of film here.

984
01:08:58,110 --> 01:09:02,281
A man would be an idiot not to be
a little cautious about a movie like that.

985
01:09:02,364 --> 01:09:04,158
And, Lee, you're no idiot.

986
01:09:04,491 --> 01:09:06,618
I'm not saying I'm not interested.

987
01:09:06,702 --> 01:09:08,912
It's just, being a distributor
is not what I do.

988
01:09:08,996 --> 01:09:10,873
I'm a movie producer, you know?

989
01:09:10,956 --> 01:09:13,125
I'm here to make good movies,
nothing more...

990
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:15,418
...and nothing, well,
maybe less, sometimes.

991
01:09:15,501 --> 01:09:16,586
Hey!

992
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,046
Choose a fucking lane!

993
01:09:20,465 --> 01:09:23,092
Not you, just an idiot...
Don't give me the finger!

994
01:09:23,176 --> 01:09:25,136
I'll fucking have you killed!

995
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,930
<i>So, bottom line is l'm not Paramount.</i>

996
01:09:28,014 --> 01:09:29,265
<i>You know what l'm saying?</i>

997
01:09:29,348 --> 01:09:31,184
I got a select few distributors.

998
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:35,353
I buy their little movies and I accomplish
what I want and I get out of there.

999
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:38,440
Very business-like, very easy,
and very little risk.

1000
01:09:38,523 --> 01:09:41,944
We're talking Dr. Zhivago.
It'll be packing them in. For a year...

1001
01:09:42,028 --> 01:09:45,782
...two years you won't have to deal
with anybody else's movie but mine.

1002
01:09:45,907 --> 01:09:48,868
Nobody's but yours.
Well, what's the rush here?

1003
01:09:49,368 --> 01:09:51,912
I want to be able to announce
the deal at Cannes.

1004
01:09:51,995 --> 01:09:54,039
If I had time for a courtship, I would.

1005
01:09:54,122 --> 01:09:56,875
I'd take you out, hold your hand,
kiss your cheek.

1006
01:09:56,958 --> 01:09:58,210
But I'm not in that position.

1007
01:09:58,335 --> 01:10:01,922
I need to know right now if you
and I are in bed together or not.

1008
01:10:02,005 --> 01:10:04,174
If you want my movie,
you must come to terms...

1009
01:10:04,257 --> 01:10:06,176
...with your fear and desire.

1010
01:10:07,135 --> 01:10:09,345
Fear and desire, huh, Clarence?

1011
01:10:11,055 --> 01:10:14,558
<i>Don't you know that my films have
grossed more than $ 2.8 billion?</i>

1012
01:10:14,642 --> 01:10:15,643
<i>Let me talk to Elliot.</i>

1013
01:10:15,768 --> 01:10:18,813
<i>-You want to talk to Elliot?
-Let me talk to Elliot.</i>

1014
01:10:19,271 --> 01:10:21,440
Elliot. He wants to talk to you.

1015
01:10:23,734 --> 01:10:24,692
Hi, Lee.

1016
01:10:24,776 --> 01:10:27,028
Elliot, where do you know this guy from?

1017
01:10:27,112 --> 01:10:29,405
He's a friend of Dick's, remember?

1018
01:10:29,697 --> 01:10:31,241
<i>Who the fuck is Dick?</i>

1019
01:10:34,911 --> 01:10:37,248
You want me to suck his dick?

1020
01:10:37,998 --> 01:10:39,166
<i>Who the fuck is Dick?</i>

1021
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,876
Oh, who the fuck is Dick?

1022
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:41,710
<i>Yeah.</i>

1023
01:10:41,793 --> 01:10:43,628
My friend. He's in my acting class.

1024
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,796
You told him I'm an actor?

1025
01:10:44,921 --> 01:10:48,591
Is he any good?
ls he talented, or... Really?

1026
01:10:49,175 --> 01:10:51,095
How does Dick know this guy?

1027
01:10:52,888 --> 01:10:54,306
They grew up together.

1028
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:57,268
Okay, Wednesday at the hotel, 3:00.

1029
01:10:57,393 --> 01:10:58,936
Bring the whole fucking cast.

1030
01:10:59,018 --> 01:11:03,064
Elliot, don't call me here anymore,
especially not on Sunday, all right?

1031
01:11:04,023 --> 01:11:05,358
What did he say?

1032
01:11:05,441 --> 01:11:07,652
Just hold on. Shut up for a second.

1033
01:11:07,735 --> 01:11:10,280
Hey, you guys.
This is what's going to happen.

1034
01:11:10,363 --> 01:11:14,200
Three o'clock, Beverly Ambassador,
he wants to see everybody. Okay?

1035
01:11:14,576 --> 01:11:18,078
And, he'll talk to you.
If after talking to you he likes you...

1036
01:11:18,162 --> 01:11:19,872
...he'll deal with you.

1037
01:11:19,955 --> 01:11:23,333
If he doesn't, he'll say, "Fuck you,"
and walk out of the room.

1038
01:11:23,417 --> 01:11:25,752
-Did you tell him I was a...
-Shut up.

1039
01:11:25,836 --> 01:11:27,629
And he wants a sample bag.

1040
01:11:28,005 --> 01:11:29,089
No problem on all counts.

1041
01:11:29,214 --> 01:11:30,299
Great.

1042
01:11:30,549 --> 01:11:32,593
Did you tell him I was an actor?

1043
01:11:32,718 --> 01:11:34,051
Yes, I told him.

1044
01:11:34,302 --> 01:11:35,761
You told him I was good?

1045
01:11:35,845 --> 01:11:37,013
Yeah, I lied.

1046
01:11:53,904 --> 01:11:54,654
Hi.

1047
01:11:54,738 --> 01:11:56,656
-How are you doing?
-Oh, pretty good.

1048
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:58,742
-Dick? Dick Richie?
-No.

1049
01:11:58,992 --> 01:12:00,912
No, he's not here right now.

1050
01:12:02,914 --> 01:12:04,165
You live here?

1051
01:12:04,332 --> 01:12:05,416
Yes, I do.

1052
01:12:06,042 --> 01:12:07,877
You're sort of roommates?

1053
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:09,711
Exactly.

1054
01:12:10,921 --> 01:12:13,173
Maybe you can help me,
I'm looking for a friend.

1055
01:12:13,256 --> 01:12:13,882
Sure.

1056
01:12:13,965 --> 01:12:15,383
Clarence Worley from Detroit?

1057
01:12:15,467 --> 01:12:17,552
He's hanging with a pretty girl
named Alabama?

1058
01:12:17,636 --> 01:12:20,013
Yeah, I know them. They've been by here.

1059
01:12:20,138 --> 01:12:21,306
-You've seen them?
-Yes.

1060
01:12:21,389 --> 01:12:22,557
Are they staying here?

1061
01:12:22,641 --> 01:12:24,559
No, they're staying at the...

1062
01:12:24,935 --> 01:12:28,354
...Safari Motor, Motel lnn. Safari Motel.

1063
01:12:30,272 --> 01:12:31,732
-Safari Motel.
-Yes.

1064
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:36,237
How do you know that? I mean,
have you been over there?

1065
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:40,991
No, they were here,
and they said they were going to go there.

1066
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:43,952
Then they went.

1067
01:12:44,953 --> 01:12:47,080
-Yeah?
-Yeah, Safari Motel.

1068
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:48,581
Safari Motel.

1069
01:12:48,706 --> 01:12:51,835
You want to watch some TV or something?
They might be back.

1070
01:12:51,918 --> 01:12:53,503
No, thank you.

1071
01:12:53,586 --> 01:12:54,504
Okay.

1072
01:12:55,046 --> 01:12:56,506
You take care, I might be back.

1073
01:12:56,589 --> 01:12:58,383
Yeah, man. Okay, be cool.

1074
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:06,890
Don't be condescending to me, man.
I'll fucking kill you, man.

1075
01:13:15,024 --> 01:13:18,110
I'm so proud of you.
Did I do my part okay?

1076
01:13:18,235 --> 01:13:19,403
Alabama, you were perfect.

1077
01:13:19,486 --> 01:13:20,654
Like a ninja?

1078
01:13:20,737 --> 01:13:21,738
Like a ninja.

1079
01:13:21,822 --> 01:13:24,366
I'm going to go grab us something to eat.

1080
01:13:25,242 --> 01:13:28,537
I'll go jump in the tub and get all wet,
and slippery, and soapy.

1081
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:31,748
And hop onto that waterbed.
And watch X-rated movies...

1082
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:34,876
...until you get your ass
back into my loving arms.

1083
01:13:37,378 --> 01:13:38,713
Hurry back now.

1084
01:13:46,888 --> 01:13:49,432
We now return to Bullit
already in progress.

1085
01:14:01,068 --> 01:14:01,903
Hi.

1086
01:14:04,071 --> 01:14:05,573
Hi!

1087
01:14:15,081 --> 01:14:16,166
Cigarette?

1088
01:14:16,875 --> 01:14:17,877
No.

1089
01:14:22,882 --> 01:14:24,675
That's a very nice outfit.

1090
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:27,511
This?

1091
01:14:28,053 --> 01:14:31,056
I got this in Las Vegas, Nevada.

1092
01:14:41,942 --> 01:14:44,860
Alabama, where's our coke?
And where's Clarence?

1093
01:14:46,570 --> 01:14:48,155
When's he coming back?

1094
01:14:49,156 --> 01:14:51,700
I'm sorry, I think you have the wrong room.

1095
01:14:51,826 --> 01:14:53,202
My name is Sadie.

1096
01:14:55,579 --> 01:14:59,333
We don't have any Coke,
but there's a Pepsi machine down the hall.

1097
01:15:00,292 --> 01:15:03,378
I don't know anybody named Clarence.
Perhaps my husband does.

1098
01:15:03,461 --> 01:15:07,382
You can ask him because he'll be home
in a minute. He plays football.

1099
01:15:09,592 --> 01:15:11,177
He's just at practice.

1100
01:15:21,061 --> 01:15:22,479
Give me your hand.

1101
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:23,981
Okay.

1102
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:32,031
You are unbelievably cute.

1103
01:15:33,241 --> 01:15:35,243
Thank you. Thanks.

1104
01:15:37,953 --> 01:15:39,538
Let me see those eyes.

1105
01:15:42,583 --> 01:15:43,750
What a face.

1106
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:49,131
Do me a favor. Turn around for me.

1107
01:15:49,506 --> 01:15:50,507
Okay.

1108
01:15:51,508 --> 01:15:53,050
No, go the other way.

1109
01:15:54,177 --> 01:15:55,178
Okay.

1110
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:15,155
That hurts, don't it?

1111
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:19,242
Get on your feet, sweetie.
You ain't hurt that bad.

1112
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:23,789
Now, where's our coke? Where's Clarence?

1113
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:26,041
And when's he comin' back?

1114
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:29,168
Okay.

1115
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:33,214
Fuck you.

1116
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:36,426
Fuck me...

1117
01:16:43,892 --> 01:16:45,851
What's the matter, baby, huh?

1118
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:48,437
Can't breathe?

1119
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:54,735
You better get used to that.

1120
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:57,947
Hi.

1121
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,281
Smells like hamburgers here.

1122
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:02,408
Tell me, what is the biggest,
baddest hamburger you guys got?

1123
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:04,494
Steve's Double Chili Cheeseburger.

1124
01:17:04,577 --> 01:17:06,538
Give me two of them bad boys.

1125
01:17:07,038 --> 01:17:08,748
Two chili fries. And...

1126
01:17:08,832 --> 01:17:10,542
...two large Diet Cokes.

1127
01:17:11,251 --> 01:17:12,502
Anything else?

1128
01:17:15,338 --> 01:17:16,256
Come here.

1129
01:17:16,339 --> 01:17:18,091
Look at yourself! Take a good look!

1130
01:17:18,174 --> 01:17:20,217
Think your boyfriend
would go for that shit?

1131
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:23,054
If you do you're fucking stupid.
You know that?

1132
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:24,806
You're a very pretty girl.

1133
01:17:24,889 --> 01:17:27,100
But you won't be very pretty for very long.

1134
01:17:27,183 --> 01:17:31,354
I'll ask you a fucking question.
And you give me the right fucking answer!

1135
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,440
Now...

1136
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:36,151
...where's my coke?

1137
01:17:42,072 --> 01:17:43,824
Turn around. Turn around!

1138
01:17:45,326 --> 01:17:46,411
Answer me!

1139
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:52,459
Come on.

1140
01:17:57,838 --> 01:17:59,756
You got a lot of heart, kid.

1141
01:18:02,843 --> 01:18:04,762
Yeah, that is a great issue.

1142
01:18:05,637 --> 01:18:07,973
You gotten to the story on Elvis yet?

1143
01:18:08,766 --> 01:18:10,350
No. I hadn't.

1144
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:15,271
That's probably the best piece
I've read on Elvis Presley in my entire life.

1145
01:18:15,354 --> 01:18:16,606
Look at this.

1146
01:18:17,273 --> 01:18:18,941
See, it tries to pin down...

1147
01:18:19,025 --> 01:18:21,778
...what the attraction is
after all these years.

1148
01:18:21,861 --> 01:18:24,781
It covers the whole spectrum.
Talks to the fans...

1149
01:18:25,114 --> 01:18:27,658
...people who grew up with him
and love his music.

1150
01:18:27,742 --> 01:18:29,910
Then, there's the fanatics. Right?

1151
01:18:30,368 --> 01:18:33,413
I don't know about you,
but they give me the creeps.

1152
01:18:34,331 --> 01:18:36,124
Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean.

1153
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:37,709
I mean, look at her.

1154
01:18:37,793 --> 01:18:41,296
Looks like she fell off the ugly tree
and hit every branch on the way down.

1155
01:18:49,053 --> 01:18:52,348
Now the first time you kill somebody,
that's the hardest.

1156
01:18:54,518 --> 01:18:58,271
I don't give a shit if you're fuckin' wired up,
or Jack the Ripper.

1157
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:05,277
Remember that guy in Texas?

1158
01:19:05,361 --> 01:19:08,656
The guy up in that fucking tower,
killed all them people?

1159
01:19:09,323 --> 01:19:12,827
I bet you green money,
the first little black dot he took a beat on...

1160
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:15,079
...that was the bitch of the bunch.

1161
01:19:17,248 --> 01:19:19,708
First one is tough. No fucking fooling.

1162
01:19:20,625 --> 01:19:22,919
The second one
ain't no fuckin' Mardi Gras...

1163
01:19:23,002 --> 01:19:26,548
...but it's better than the first
'cause you still feel the same thing...

1164
01:19:26,631 --> 01:19:28,007
...except it's more diluted.

1165
01:19:28,091 --> 01:19:30,135
You know, it's better.

1166
01:19:31,344 --> 01:19:34,055
I threw up on the first one,
you believe that?

1167
01:19:35,348 --> 01:19:36,808
Then the third one.

1168
01:19:37,433 --> 01:19:40,060
The third one is easy, you level right off.

1169
01:19:42,771 --> 01:19:45,649
That's no problem. Now... Shit!

1170
01:19:47,443 --> 01:19:50,821
Now, I do it just to watch
their fuckin' expression change.

1171
01:19:59,787 --> 01:20:01,581
I don't fuckin' believe it.

1172
01:20:03,709 --> 01:20:05,627
Did you put it under the bed?

1173
01:20:05,836 --> 01:20:06,712
Yes.

1174
01:20:09,923 --> 01:20:12,759
I can't believe it.
You put it under the fucking bed.

1175
01:20:12,842 --> 01:20:15,052
I didn't look under the fuckin' bed.

1176
01:20:19,474 --> 01:20:21,225
I can't believe you put it there.

1177
01:20:21,309 --> 01:20:23,686
I can't believe I didn't look under the bed.

1178
01:20:23,770 --> 01:20:25,480
I'm getting fucking old.

1179
01:20:27,064 --> 01:20:28,524
Journey's end baby.

1180
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:30,942
Snow at the end of the rainbow.

1181
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:36,198
One less thing I gotta fucking worry about.

1182
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:47,709
This is it, baby.

1183
01:20:49,503 --> 01:20:50,837
Moment of truth.

1184
01:21:00,597 --> 01:21:03,225
You got a lot of heart, kid, you know that?

1185
01:21:05,267 --> 01:21:06,644
You want to play?

1186
01:21:07,269 --> 01:21:09,355
Huh? ls that what you want?

1187
01:21:10,648 --> 01:21:12,442
You want to play with Daddy?

1188
01:21:12,526 --> 01:21:15,779
Come on. Come on I'll give you one shot
because I like you.

1189
01:21:15,862 --> 01:21:18,698
Stick it in me, baby.
Come on stick it in Daddy.

1190
01:21:19,699 --> 01:21:22,493
Stick it in me. Go ahead.

1191
01:21:22,785 --> 01:21:23,786
Come on!

1192
01:21:23,869 --> 01:21:24,870
Come on!

1193
01:21:32,545 --> 01:21:33,712
Motherfucker!

1194
01:21:45,723 --> 01:21:48,518
All right. No more Mr. Fucking Nice Guy.

1195
01:21:48,893 --> 01:21:49,894
Oh, God!

1196
01:21:57,943 --> 01:21:59,736
What do you think of that?

1197
01:22:00,279 --> 01:22:02,489
What do you think about that, baby?

1198
01:22:02,573 --> 01:22:03,824
Wait! Wait!

1199
01:22:04,658 --> 01:22:05,826
What?

1200
01:22:07,161 --> 01:22:08,495
Why the fuck are you laughing?

1201
01:22:08,579 --> 01:22:10,289
You look ridiculous!

1202
01:22:14,834 --> 01:22:16,586
Come here! I look fucking ridiculous!

1203
01:22:16,669 --> 01:22:18,212
Get up! Laugh it up!

1204
01:22:18,296 --> 01:22:19,839
Come on, laugh it up!

1205
01:22:20,298 --> 01:22:22,384
You were in hysterics a minute ago,
so laugh!

1206
01:22:22,468 --> 01:22:23,552
You like that, don't you?

1207
01:22:23,635 --> 01:22:24,720
Fuck you!

1208
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:25,971
Shit!

1209
01:23:27,028 --> 01:23:28,029
Fuck!

1210
01:23:28,279 --> 01:23:32,201
Motherfucker! Alabama, we gotta go!
Jesus Christ!

1211
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:34,954
Come on, darling.
We gotta get the fuck out of here!

1212
01:23:35,079 --> 01:23:37,456
Come on.

1213
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:40,208
The cops are gonna be here
any fucking second!

1214
01:23:40,291 --> 01:23:41,292
Fuck!

1215
01:23:41,376 --> 01:23:42,710
Fuck, come on!

1216
01:23:59,351 --> 01:24:00,352
Fuck!

1217
01:24:02,271 --> 01:24:05,858
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1218
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:09,404
Get the fuck out of the way!

1219
01:24:20,748 --> 01:24:21,832
Oh, fuck!

1220
01:24:23,208 --> 01:24:24,042
Fuck!

1221
01:24:24,126 --> 01:24:25,961
-What?
-I don't fucking believe this!

1222
01:24:26,044 --> 01:24:29,256
Goddamn it! I knew it! I fucking knew it!

1223
01:24:41,477 --> 01:24:44,897
I should have my goddamn
head examined for driving like this.

1224
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:46,732
Look Carla... Kandi...

1225
01:24:47,149 --> 01:24:48,399
Kandi, you've got to help me.

1226
01:24:48,524 --> 01:24:49,776
What can I do?

1227
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:51,527
Take this. Hold this.

1228
01:24:51,611 --> 01:24:54,322
- What are you? High? No.
- Put this in your purse.

1229
01:24:54,405 --> 01:24:55,948
I won't put that shit in my purse.

1230
01:24:56,032 --> 01:24:57,825
He's not going to search you.
You didn't do anything.

1231
01:24:57,909 --> 01:25:00,536
-Now just put it in your bra!
-I'm not wearing one.

1232
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:04,373
Please, he's almost here!
Just fucking put it in your pants!

1233
01:25:04,957 --> 01:25:05,957
No.

1234
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,460
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.

1235
01:25:08,543 --> 01:25:10,462
Read my lips. No.

1236
01:25:13,256 --> 01:25:17,260
-After all I did for you, you whore!
-Who the fuck do you think you...

1237
01:25:23,182 --> 01:25:24,016
Hi.

1238
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:28,229
Look, dickhead. It's your bad luck
that we caught you speeding...

1239
01:25:28,312 --> 01:25:31,440
...and it's your bad luck that
you had a bag of uncut cocaine.

1240
01:25:31,524 --> 01:25:33,776
-Not a little vial.
-A fucking baggy.

1241
01:25:33,984 --> 01:25:35,528
Hey, you got caught.

1242
01:25:35,694 --> 01:25:38,072
It's all fun until you get caught.
Now we got you.

1243
01:25:38,197 --> 01:25:41,324
Okay, Mr. Elliot, fucking actor,
you just made the big time.

1244
01:25:41,408 --> 01:25:43,618
-You're no longer an extra...
-A bit player.

1245
01:25:43,701 --> 01:25:44,869
...a supporting actor.

1246
01:25:44,994 --> 01:25:46,746
You're a fucking star.

1247
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:48,749
You'll be playing your one-man show...

1248
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:51,377
...nightly for the next two fucking years!

1249
01:25:51,544 --> 01:25:52,920
For a captive audience.

1250
01:25:53,003 --> 01:25:55,798
You'll get out in a few years
and meet some old lady.

1251
01:25:55,881 --> 01:25:58,842
You'll marry and be understanding
to your wife's needs...

1252
01:25:58,925 --> 01:26:01,553
...because you'll know
what it's like to be a woman.

1253
01:26:01,636 --> 01:26:05,306
You'll only want to fuck her ass
'cause her pussy won't be tight enough.

1254
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:07,434
Good point, Detective. Right?

1255
01:26:07,517 --> 01:26:08,768
Fucking faggot!

1256
01:26:09,269 --> 01:26:13,481
Krinkle, this is it, and it's all ours.
I mean, talk about falling into something...

1257
01:26:13,565 --> 01:26:15,649
Would you shut up!
I can't understand shit.

1258
01:26:15,732 --> 01:26:18,110
What happened?
What are you talking about?

1259
01:26:18,235 --> 01:26:19,611
Okay, all right.

1260
01:26:19,862 --> 01:26:21,989
Patrol car pulls a guy
over for speeding.

1261
01:26:22,072 --> 01:26:23,490
Suspect is covered with coke...

1262
01:26:23,574 --> 01:26:25,951
...so they bring him to me and Nicholson.

1263
01:26:26,076 --> 01:26:27,453
Nicholson and l.

1264
01:26:28,412 --> 01:26:30,289
What's the difference?

1265
01:26:30,372 --> 01:26:31,622
We go to work on him.

1266
01:26:31,748 --> 01:26:33,791
We know something is strange 'cause he...

1267
01:26:33,875 --> 01:26:37,795
...is fucking stupid, and he's got
a big bag of coke, and it's uncut.

1268
01:26:38,129 --> 01:26:40,423
And you won't believe
what he's got to say.

1269
01:26:40,506 --> 01:26:43,468
Seems a cop from some department,
stole...

1270
01:26:43,551 --> 01:26:46,012
...$ 500,000 worth of coke
from the property cage...

1271
01:26:46,095 --> 01:26:48,181
He sat on the shit for a year and a half.

1272
01:26:48,264 --> 01:26:51,016
-Now, the cop's got this weirdo...
-Suspect's words.

1273
01:26:51,099 --> 01:26:52,184
...to front for him.

1274
01:26:52,309 --> 01:26:55,896
Our guy, Elliot Blitzer, is making a deal
between them and his boss...

1275
01:26:55,979 --> 01:26:58,941
...big-time fucking movie producer
named Lee Donowitz.

1276
01:26:59,025 --> 01:27:00,943
He did Coming Home in a Body Bag.

1277
01:27:01,027 --> 01:27:02,195
A Vietnam movie?

1278
01:27:02,278 --> 01:27:03,863
-Yeah.
-Good fucking movie.

1279
01:27:03,946 --> 01:27:06,114
Fucking A. Great fucking movie.

1280
01:27:06,281 --> 01:27:07,657
So, do you believe him?

1281
01:27:07,741 --> 01:27:09,201
I believe he believes him.

1282
01:27:09,284 --> 01:27:10,994
This guy is too rattled to be lying.

1283
01:27:11,078 --> 01:27:13,872
He'd roll over on his mom, dad,
his two-pantied granny...

1284
01:27:13,955 --> 01:27:16,666
...and the King of Siam
if he had anything on him.

1285
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:20,670
This guy was a sissy. This rabbit
will do anything not to do any time.

1286
01:27:20,796 --> 01:27:23,506
You know what he'll do? He'll wear a wire.

1287
01:27:24,006 --> 01:27:24,757
He'll wear a wire?

1288
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,051
He'll wear a wire, we talked to him.

1289
01:27:29,345 --> 01:27:31,889
Dirty cops, we got to get
lnternal Affairs on this.

1290
01:27:32,015 --> 01:27:33,391
I don't care who you bring in.

1291
01:27:33,475 --> 01:27:35,477
You can bring in the state enlisted...

1292
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:38,105
...the ghost of Steve McQueen,
ten Roman gladiators.

1293
01:27:38,230 --> 01:27:41,524
I don't give a shit as long as me and Todd
get credit for the bust.

1294
01:27:41,607 --> 01:27:44,276
Listen, we found him.
We just want the fucking collar.

1295
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:46,070
That's it. End of story.

1296
01:27:47,696 --> 01:27:48,864
You got it.

1297
01:27:54,036 --> 01:27:56,705
Did I ever tell you
how much I hate airports?

1298
01:27:58,790 --> 01:28:01,876
See, I used to live by one
back in Dearborn, you know.

1299
01:28:03,336 --> 01:28:07,258
Really frustrating living next to an airport
when you don't got shit.

1300
01:28:10,553 --> 01:28:14,014
And all day long I'm seeing
and hearing people doing exactly...

1301
01:28:14,098 --> 01:28:16,307
...what I want to be doing, but couldn't.

1302
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:17,350
What?

1303
01:28:19,018 --> 01:28:23,314
Starting new lives, leaving Detroit,
vacations, business trips...

1304
01:28:25,358 --> 01:28:27,527
...fun, fun, fun.

1305
01:28:32,823 --> 01:28:35,284
Knowing us, we can jump
on any of those planes...

1306
01:28:35,367 --> 01:28:38,203
...and go anywhere we want.
Gives me a whole new outlook.

1307
01:28:38,287 --> 01:28:39,663
Love how it works out.

1308
01:28:39,747 --> 01:28:41,999
You're not kidding.
We got lives to start over.

1309
01:28:42,082 --> 01:28:45,252
We should go somewhere
where we can start from scratch.

1310
01:28:46,712 --> 01:28:48,547
I've been in America all my life.

1311
01:28:48,630 --> 01:28:51,424
I'd like to see what TV
in other countries is like.

1312
01:28:51,507 --> 01:28:54,677
Where do you think we should go,
my little turtle dove?

1313
01:28:56,763 --> 01:28:57,764
Cancn.

1314
01:28:58,931 --> 01:29:00,391
Cancn, why Cancn?

1315
01:29:01,267 --> 01:29:04,270
It's got a nice ring to it.
Sounds like a movie.

1316
01:29:05,021 --> 01:29:07,981
<i>Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancn,
don't you think?</i>

1317
01:29:09,191 --> 01:29:11,735
In my movie, darling, you get top billing.

1318
01:29:14,071 --> 01:29:18,117
Don't worry about nothing, all right?
It's all going to work out for us.

1319
01:29:19,744 --> 01:29:20,995
We deserve it.

1320
01:29:33,632 --> 01:29:36,426
You sure that's how you get
to the Beverly Ambassador?

1321
01:29:36,510 --> 01:29:38,762
Yeah, man, I'm positive.

1322
01:29:40,222 --> 01:29:42,681
Let me tell you, if we get lost
that's your ass.

1323
01:29:42,765 --> 01:29:45,393
Why don't you get out of
my beer and get a fucking job?

1324
01:29:45,476 --> 01:29:46,560
Yeah, okay.

1325
01:29:46,727 --> 01:29:48,312
-Can we go?
-We're out the door.

1326
01:29:48,396 --> 01:29:49,814
We must meet Elliot in the lobby.

1327
01:29:49,897 --> 01:29:51,440
I'll see we got everything.

1328
01:29:51,524 --> 01:29:53,484
You all right?

1329
01:29:55,611 --> 01:29:56,404
Yes.

1330
01:29:56,487 --> 01:29:59,364
-I'm out, Floyd.
-Are you here? No, he's not here.

1331
01:29:59,447 --> 01:30:00,615
Wait, wait, wait!

1332
01:30:00,698 --> 01:30:01,866
Come on, Dick!

1333
01:30:01,950 --> 01:30:03,493
Somebody here for me.

1334
01:30:03,868 --> 01:30:04,828
Hello?

1335
01:30:05,203 --> 01:30:07,664
Hey. Hi, Catherine, I was just walkin' out...

1336
01:30:07,789 --> 01:30:08,790
What?

1337
01:30:11,042 --> 01:30:12,043
Serious?

1338
01:30:13,294 --> 01:30:14,379
She said that?

1339
01:30:14,462 --> 01:30:16,130
What did she say? Come on, okay?

1340
01:30:16,213 --> 01:30:19,383
Yo, Catherine, thank you, thank you.

1341
01:30:20,968 --> 01:30:23,637
I'm going to talk to you tomorrow.
All right?

1342
01:30:25,890 --> 01:30:27,058
We got to go.

1343
01:30:29,894 --> 01:30:30,687
I got the part.

1344
01:30:30,770 --> 01:30:31,688
Wow!

1345
01:30:31,938 --> 01:30:33,106
I got the part.

1346
01:30:33,189 --> 01:30:35,858
That's perfect. That's great.
That's wonderful.

1347
01:30:35,941 --> 01:30:37,860
Didn't even want a callback.

1348
01:30:40,904 --> 01:30:42,614
That's cool, way to go!

1349
01:30:43,574 --> 01:30:44,992
I got a 7:00 call.

1350
01:30:45,075 --> 01:30:46,952
That's great. Come on, let's go.

1351
01:30:47,035 --> 01:30:49,413
I want to hear all about it, okay? Come on.

1352
01:30:49,496 --> 01:30:50,747
Hey, Clarence!

1353
01:30:51,539 --> 01:30:52,415
What?

1354
01:30:55,586 --> 01:30:57,713
Nothing. Forget it.

1355
01:30:58,464 --> 01:30:59,923
All right, come on.

1356
01:31:02,050 --> 01:31:04,178
Hey, get some beer...

1357
01:31:07,847 --> 01:31:09,849
...and some cleaning products.

1358
01:31:21,069 --> 01:31:23,446
I'm losing a fucking fortune over here.

1359
01:31:30,285 --> 01:31:32,746
You talkin' to me, you fucking wop, you?

1360
01:31:55,435 --> 01:31:57,896
Put your jacket on. Put your jacket on.

1361
01:31:58,897 --> 01:31:59,980
-Ready?
-Yeah.

1362
01:32:00,106 --> 01:32:02,650
Put your jacket on. One sleeve at a time.

1363
01:32:04,276 --> 01:32:06,195
It's a big game, now, Elliot.

1364
01:32:07,029 --> 01:32:09,490
-It's okay, come on. You all right?
-No.

1365
01:32:10,866 --> 01:32:13,744
Elliot, look at me. Look at me.
You comfortable?

1366
01:32:15,246 --> 01:32:16,871
Am I comfortable? I've got a...

1367
01:32:16,955 --> 01:32:20,291
...like a, brick in my scrotum.

1368
01:32:20,583 --> 01:32:22,252
That's the best place for it, okay?

1369
01:32:22,335 --> 01:32:24,504
They won't search your balls.

1370
01:32:24,587 --> 01:32:26,423
Don't you think they might
see this perhaps?

1371
01:32:26,506 --> 01:32:29,050
No. It's okay.
When you stand up, it'll be okay.

1372
01:32:29,175 --> 01:32:30,343
-Elliot.
-Yeah?

1373
01:32:30,427 --> 01:32:31,678
Say something.

1374
01:32:32,929 --> 01:32:34,930
Okay. Hi. How are you?

1375
01:32:35,347 --> 01:32:38,183
My name is Elliot,
and I'm with the Cub Scouts of America.

1376
01:32:38,267 --> 01:32:42,312
We're, we're selling uncut cocaine
to get to the jamboree.

1377
01:32:43,064 --> 01:32:45,316
-Just talk regular, Elliot.
-I'm sorry.

1378
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,318
Elliot, stop fucking around.

1379
01:32:48,069 --> 01:32:49,738
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1380
01:32:49,821 --> 01:32:50,822
You get that shit?

1381
01:32:50,905 --> 01:32:54,032
Remember, we'll be right down the hall
monitoring you.

1382
01:32:54,241 --> 01:32:56,785
And if somebody does something
you can't hear...

1383
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:58,954
...like puts a gun to my fucking eye?

1384
01:32:59,037 --> 01:33:02,291
-We've done this a thousand times.
-We know what we're doing.

1385
01:33:02,374 --> 01:33:05,878
Okay? We're the best at...
Now, listen. No fucking around.

1386
01:33:06,044 --> 01:33:09,005
Anything happens, we'll be there
like fucking gangbusters?

1387
01:33:09,088 --> 01:33:10,256
You must remember something.

1388
01:33:10,381 --> 01:33:13,217
You don't want to go to jail, right?

1389
01:33:13,301 --> 01:33:14,969
No. I don't want to go to jail.

1390
01:33:15,053 --> 01:33:16,304
So, what do we got to do?

1391
01:33:16,387 --> 01:33:18,765
We got to put your boss in jail, okay?

1392
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:23,311
You do that, and you got to show in court,
beyond any reasonable doubt...

1393
01:33:23,394 --> 01:33:26,313
...that this respectable man
in the Hollywood community...

1394
01:33:26,396 --> 01:33:27,355
...is dealing cocaine.

1395
01:33:27,439 --> 01:33:29,483
We must prove it, and you must do it.

1396
01:33:29,566 --> 01:33:30,817
That's what we're doing here.

1397
01:33:30,901 --> 01:33:33,195
You're going to be okay,
you won't get hurt.

1398
01:33:33,278 --> 01:33:35,572
Okay? So what you got to do
is to get him...

1399
01:33:35,655 --> 01:33:37,949
...to admit on tape, all right?

1400
01:33:38,992 --> 01:33:41,369
That he's buying this coke. Okay, champ?

1401
01:33:41,453 --> 01:33:43,454
-Get a hold of yourself.
-Okay.

1402
01:33:44,163 --> 01:33:46,082
I'm going to get some coffee.

1403
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:52,339
Alabama, you really got that
playing basketball?

1404
01:33:52,464 --> 01:33:55,008
Yes, I got an elbow right in the eye.
Then...

1405
01:33:55,092 --> 01:33:57,386
...l got hurled the ball
when I'm not looking.

1406
01:33:57,469 --> 01:33:58,470
Wham!

1407
01:33:58,929 --> 01:34:00,013
Right in my face.

1408
01:34:00,138 --> 01:34:01,764
You should be careful.

1409
01:34:02,765 --> 01:34:03,849
I should.

1410
01:34:17,113 --> 01:34:19,198
What the fuck did you bring that for?

1411
01:34:19,281 --> 01:34:20,282
In case.

1412
01:34:21,283 --> 01:34:22,368
In case of what?

1413
01:34:22,493 --> 01:34:24,787
I don't know, what do you want me to say?

1414
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:27,623
Look, Clarence,
Lee Donowitz is not a pimp.

1415
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:30,960
I know that, but one thing
this week has taught me...

1416
01:34:31,043 --> 01:34:35,797
...it's better to have a gun and not need it
than to need a gun and not have it.

1417
01:34:41,511 --> 01:34:42,762
There he is.

1418
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:54,648
Elliot, your motivation is to stay out of jail.

1419
01:34:55,482 --> 01:34:56,859
Easy, easy, easy.

1420
01:34:57,818 --> 01:35:00,362
-Hi.
-Hi.

1421
01:35:03,658 --> 01:35:06,661
-I guess it's about that time.
-Yeah.

1422
01:35:07,662 --> 01:35:08,830
Here we go.

1423
01:35:18,172 --> 01:35:20,424
You're an actor. Act, motherfucker.

1424
01:35:26,846 --> 01:35:28,264
-Elliot.
-Yeah?

1425
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:31,476
Get on your knees.

1426
01:35:31,559 --> 01:35:32,560
Oh, no.

1427
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:33,853
What?

1428
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,773
-I said get on your knees!
-What the fuck?

1429
01:35:36,856 --> 01:35:39,609
Shut the fuck up!
I know what the fuck I'm doing.

1430
01:35:39,692 --> 01:35:42,612
You think I'm pretty fucking stupid,
don't you? Don't you?

1431
01:35:42,695 --> 01:35:45,489
No? Don't you fucking lie to me,
you motherfucker!

1432
01:35:45,572 --> 01:35:48,533
He's bluffing you, Elliot.
Can't you see that?

1433
01:35:48,617 --> 01:35:49,868
I want to hear you say...

1434
01:35:49,993 --> 01:35:51,536
..."You are, without a doubt..."

1435
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:52,996
-What's wrong?
-Shut up!

1436
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,664
Say it! I want to hear you say it!

1437
01:35:54,748 --> 01:35:57,292
"You are, without a doubt,
the dumbest fucker...

1438
01:35:57,417 --> 01:35:59,002
"...I've ever seen on this planet."

1439
01:35:59,086 --> 01:36:01,088
-Say it!
-Dumb fucker.

1440
01:36:02,588 --> 01:36:05,341
-Apparently, I'm not as dumb...
-He didn't do nothing!

1441
01:36:05,424 --> 01:36:08,177
I'm not as dumb
as you fucking think I am, am l?

1442
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:10,472
What the fuck is waiting for us up there?

1443
01:36:10,555 --> 01:36:12,057
What the fuck's waiting for us?

1444
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:13,308
He's going to shoot him.

1445
01:36:13,433 --> 01:36:16,311
Tell me, or I'll pump two
in your face right here and now.

1446
01:36:16,395 --> 01:36:18,313
He's not going to shoot him.

1447
01:36:18,605 --> 01:36:19,688
Motherfuck!

1448
01:36:19,814 --> 01:36:21,065
He's going to shoot him.

1449
01:36:21,148 --> 01:36:23,025
Like Nick Curry said, "lf I'm wrong...

1450
01:36:23,109 --> 01:36:25,194
"...l'll fucking apologize, all right?"

1451
01:36:25,277 --> 01:36:26,695
Something's amiss, I feel it.

1452
01:36:26,779 --> 01:36:30,366
If anything strange goes down,
you'll be the first one shot.

1453
01:36:30,449 --> 01:36:32,493
He didn't do anything, what are you...

1454
01:36:32,576 --> 01:36:34,870
Shut up!
I'll blow this motherfucker away.

1455
01:36:34,954 --> 01:36:36,037
Fuck you!

1456
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:40,709
I wish somebody would come and get me
because I don't like this anymore!

1457
01:36:40,792 --> 01:36:42,836
Get a hold of yourself, you fucking sissy!

1458
01:36:42,919 --> 01:36:47,340
I really wish somebody would just come
and take me away! Just take me away!

1459
01:36:47,632 --> 01:36:49,718
Hang in there, Elliot, goddamn it!

1460
01:36:49,801 --> 01:36:52,637
I can't take this,
I'm sorry, but I just can't!

1461
01:36:53,138 --> 01:36:55,431
I wish somebody would just come
to my rescue...

1462
01:36:55,514 --> 01:36:57,808
...and everything will be all right.

1463
01:36:59,184 --> 01:37:02,104
-Elliot. Elliot.
-What?

1464
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:04,022
I'm sorry, all right?

1465
01:37:05,357 --> 01:37:08,152
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Friends?

1466
01:37:10,486 --> 01:37:12,363
What the fuck is with this guy?

1467
01:37:12,447 --> 01:37:13,698
Quit playing around.

1468
01:37:13,781 --> 01:37:16,117
I wasn't playing around,
I just had to be sure.

1469
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,494
That's all, that's all.
I'm sure now, okay?

1470
01:37:18,578 --> 01:37:21,248
I'm sorry, man. I didn't mean to scare you.

1471
01:37:22,374 --> 01:37:26,128
Oh, man, I like this Clarence kid,
this fucking guy is crazy.

1472
01:37:37,722 --> 01:37:38,723
Yeah.

1473
01:37:48,983 --> 01:37:50,359
Oh, man.

1474
01:37:54,197 --> 01:37:55,740
Are you Dick Richie?

1475
01:37:56,324 --> 01:37:57,325
No.

1476
01:38:00,203 --> 01:38:02,121
Do you know a Clarence Worley?

1477
01:38:02,205 --> 01:38:03,205
Yes.

1478
01:38:04,039 --> 01:38:06,750
-Do you know where we can find him?
-Yes, I do.

1479
01:38:10,045 --> 01:38:11,213
Well, where?

1480
01:38:12,047 --> 01:38:14,383
At the Beverly Ambassador.

1481
01:38:15,050 --> 01:38:16,301
Where's that?

1482
01:38:16,426 --> 01:38:17,803
Well...

1483
01:38:18,887 --> 01:38:19,970
You go...

1484
01:38:20,721 --> 01:38:23,724
-No.
-Yeah, go down...

1485
01:38:23,808 --> 01:38:26,143
You guys want to smoke a bowl, or...

1486
01:38:26,769 --> 01:38:29,231
Oh. Go down Beachwood...

1487
01:38:29,689 --> 01:38:33,777
...and drive awhile,
and then you gotta turn right, okay?

1488
01:38:34,903 --> 01:38:38,280
And then you go, and you keep driving
and you keep driving.

1489
01:38:45,454 --> 01:38:46,706
Hello, Elliot.

1490
01:38:46,789 --> 01:38:47,790
Monty.

1491
01:38:48,124 --> 01:38:49,542
Are these your friends?

1492
01:38:49,625 --> 01:38:52,920
Yeah, yeah, you could say that.

1493
01:38:53,421 --> 01:38:54,504
Everybody, this is Monty.

1494
01:38:54,629 --> 01:38:58,091
Hi. Come on in. Lee's in the can,
he'll be out in a quick.

1495
01:39:02,429 --> 01:39:04,889
Holy shit! Look at this.
Do you believe this?

1496
01:39:04,973 --> 01:39:06,433
It's a helicopter.

1497
01:39:06,558 --> 01:39:08,476
Sorry, it's nothing personal.

1498
01:39:09,519 --> 01:39:10,603
Clarence.

1499
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:15,399
There'll be no need
to search me, daredevil.

1500
01:39:15,482 --> 01:39:17,568
All you'll find is this right here.

1501
01:39:17,651 --> 01:39:19,987
Now what compelled you
to bring that along?

1502
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:22,239
The same thing that compelled you guys...

1503
01:39:22,322 --> 01:39:24,700
...to bring heavy artillery
to a business meeting.

1504
01:39:24,825 --> 01:39:26,160
I'll take that.

1505
01:39:26,577 --> 01:39:28,579
Well, you're going to have to.

1506
01:39:28,995 --> 01:39:30,413
Oh. Hi.

1507
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:32,832
Everybody's here.

1508
01:39:32,999 --> 01:39:34,876
Elliot. Who's who?

1509
01:39:37,254 --> 01:39:40,174
That's Dick on the end there.

1510
01:39:40,507 --> 01:39:41,842
Oh, that's Dick.

1511
01:39:42,092 --> 01:39:43,761
Elliot tells me you're quite gifted.

1512
01:39:43,844 --> 01:39:46,179
And, yeah, Alabama in the middle.

1513
01:39:46,512 --> 01:39:47,513
Hello.

1514
01:39:47,805 --> 01:39:48,890
Clarence on the end.

1515
01:39:49,015 --> 01:39:50,183
Lee, this guy is...

1516
01:39:50,308 --> 01:39:52,268
Boris, please. I'm meeting people now.

1517
01:39:52,351 --> 01:39:53,519
Mr. Donowitz?

1518
01:39:53,603 --> 01:39:56,147
Come on.
Don't insult me, just call me "Lee."

1519
01:39:56,272 --> 01:39:58,274
-Lee.
-Boris, shut the fuck up!

1520
01:39:58,357 --> 01:40:00,735
Come on, everybody, don't be shy.
Come on in.

1521
01:40:00,818 --> 01:40:02,695
Okay, Lee?

1522
01:40:02,987 --> 01:40:04,363
-Lee.
-Lee.

1523
01:40:04,613 --> 01:40:06,031
That's right, Lee.

1524
01:40:06,198 --> 01:40:08,367
I just gotta tell you, I really am a big fan.

1525
01:40:08,450 --> 01:40:11,119
<i>Coming Home ln a Body Bag
is my favorite movie.</i>

1526
01:40:11,203 --> 01:40:14,706
After Apocalypse Now, I think
it's the best Vietnam movie ever made.

1527
01:40:14,790 --> 01:40:16,458
Wow. Thank you very much, Clarence.

1528
01:40:16,541 --> 01:40:17,793
-Lee.
-What?

1529
01:40:18,377 --> 01:40:19,878
This guy is packing.

1530
01:40:21,128 --> 01:40:22,129
Really.

1531
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:25,424
Well, I mean, I've been pretty
scared about this whole thing.

1532
01:40:25,508 --> 01:40:28,260
I'm fairly confident you're here
to do business, so look.

1533
01:40:28,344 --> 01:40:30,096
I don't want to be a wise guy.

1534
01:40:30,179 --> 01:40:33,557
If you want, I'll lay my gun on the table.
It's up to you.

1535
01:40:36,852 --> 01:40:38,978
No, I don't think that's necessary.

1536
01:40:39,062 --> 01:40:41,981
Boris, be nice.
Make everybody some coffee. Okay?

1537
01:40:42,649 --> 01:40:45,026
-A pleasure to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

1538
01:40:45,151 --> 01:40:47,154
Honey, sit down. Relax, relax.

1539
01:40:47,905 --> 01:40:49,657
Elliot, you look like shit.

1540
01:40:49,740 --> 01:40:50,908
Oh, I'm sorry.

1541
01:40:50,991 --> 01:40:52,993
I mean, it's completely disgusting.

1542
01:40:53,077 --> 01:40:56,121
If I could get a quick signature,
it would be great.

1543
01:40:56,579 --> 01:40:58,206
Whatever Bonnie wants.

1544
01:41:00,917 --> 01:41:02,836
Like my dailies, there, Clar?

1545
01:41:03,378 --> 01:41:04,630
Is that what these are?

1546
01:41:04,755 --> 01:41:06,340
-You like them?
-They're great.

1547
01:41:06,424 --> 01:41:08,426
They better be, they cost me enough.

1548
01:41:08,509 --> 01:41:09,760
What did that day cost me?

1549
01:41:09,885 --> 01:41:11,512
$ 357,000.

1550
01:41:12,679 --> 01:41:15,515
Elliot, I swear to God,
somebody is stealing from me.

1551
01:41:15,598 --> 01:41:17,642
What's this one called, anyway?

1552
01:41:17,892 --> 01:41:19,894
It's a sequel to Body Bag.

1553
01:41:20,478 --> 01:41:21,312
Really?

1554
01:41:21,396 --> 01:41:24,065
We don't have a title yet,
but what does Joe like?

1555
01:41:24,149 --> 01:41:26,276
Body Bags Two.

1556
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:28,862
Oh. That's imaginative.

1557
01:41:29,195 --> 01:41:31,238
I've got more taste in my penis.

1558
01:41:32,698 --> 01:41:34,658
This guy is really fucking funny.

1559
01:41:34,742 --> 01:41:38,078
Most of these movies that win a lot
of Oscars, I can't stand them.

1560
01:41:38,162 --> 01:41:40,998
They're safe, geriatric
coffee-table dog shit, you know?

1561
01:41:41,081 --> 01:41:43,292
We park our cars in the same garage.

1562
01:41:44,334 --> 01:41:45,002
It's all right.

1563
01:41:45,085 --> 01:41:48,254
All they make are unwatchable
movies from unreadable books.

1564
01:41:48,337 --> 01:41:49,672
Mad Max, that's a movie.

1565
01:41:49,756 --> 01:41:52,008
The Good The Bad And The Ugly...

1566
01:41:52,091 --> 01:41:53,634
...Rio Bravo, those are movies.

1567
01:41:53,718 --> 01:41:56,096
And Coming Home in a Body Bag,
that was a movie.

1568
01:41:56,221 --> 01:41:58,974
It was the only movie that won
Oscars with balls...

1569
01:41:59,058 --> 01:42:00,976
...since Deerhunter.

1570
01:42:01,518 --> 01:42:03,020
I don't believe you.

1571
01:42:04,437 --> 01:42:07,482
What, do you like a little coffee
with your sugar, or what?

1572
01:42:07,565 --> 01:42:10,902
Lee, I'm not satisfied until
the spoon stands straight up.

1573
01:42:12,278 --> 01:42:14,072
Give me a coffee, will you?

1574
01:42:15,198 --> 01:42:17,742
My uncle Roger and my uncle Jerry,
who were in Nam...

1575
01:42:17,867 --> 01:42:19,327
...saw Coming Home in a Body Bag.

1576
01:42:19,410 --> 01:42:21,953
They said that's
the most accurate Vietnam film...

1577
01:42:22,037 --> 01:42:23,663
...they had ever seen.

1578
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:27,459
I'll tell you. When veterans
in that war say that about my project...

1579
01:42:27,542 --> 01:42:30,670
...it makes the whole thing worthwhile.
Here's to you.

1580
01:42:31,254 --> 01:42:33,382
My friend. I've just call you
my friend and I just met you.

1581
01:42:33,465 --> 01:42:36,676
You know why?
I think because we got the same interests.

1582
01:42:36,927 --> 01:42:39,303
And you know what I'd like
to do right now?

1583
01:42:39,387 --> 01:42:41,305
I'd like to see Dr. Zhivago.

1584
01:42:42,598 --> 01:42:43,766
Where is it?

1585
01:42:44,183 --> 01:42:46,477
Is there a fucking doctor
in the house, or what?

1586
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:47,728
Hang on a second.

1587
01:42:47,812 --> 01:42:49,980
<i>When you see this, you are going to shit.</i>

1588
01:42:50,064 --> 01:42:51,065
Bingo.

1589
01:42:55,528 --> 01:42:57,696
-What's the guy's name?
-Donowitz.

1590
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:15,672
Lee, that's all practically uncut.
If you so desire...

1591
01:43:15,755 --> 01:43:17,215
...you can cut that a lot more.

1592
01:43:17,298 --> 01:43:18,675
Don't worry, I'll desire.

1593
01:43:18,758 --> 01:43:20,552
Get me another cup of coffee, will you?

1594
01:43:20,635 --> 01:43:21,886
Me, too, Boris.

1595
01:43:22,345 --> 01:43:25,473
I have to hand it to you, Clarence,
this is not nose garbage.

1596
01:43:25,557 --> 01:43:27,142
<i>This is quality stuff.</i>

1597
01:43:27,684 --> 01:43:30,352
Perfect merchandise. The only trouble is...

1598
01:43:30,728 --> 01:43:33,439
...when I'm offered a deal
that's too good to be true...

1599
01:43:33,522 --> 01:43:35,315
...it's because it's a lie.

1600
01:43:44,283 --> 01:43:46,160
Convince me you're on the level.

1601
01:43:46,243 --> 01:43:47,202
Convince him.

1602
01:43:47,286 --> 01:43:49,662
If he don't bite, we have nothing
but possession.

1603
01:43:49,787 --> 01:43:52,832
We got lots of sandwich shit back there,
make something.

1604
01:43:52,915 --> 01:43:55,376
We got pastrami, nice rye...
Anybody want anything?

1605
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:56,794
You, got any aspirin?

1606
01:43:56,878 --> 01:43:58,671
Yeah, sure. Get him that.

1607
01:43:59,797 --> 01:44:02,425
Well, Lee, it's like this.

1608
01:44:03,468 --> 01:44:06,845
You're getting the bargain of a life time
because I don't know what I'm doing.

1609
01:44:06,928 --> 01:44:11,349
You're used to dealing with professionals
which I'm not. I'm a rank amateur.

1610
01:44:11,641 --> 01:44:14,187
What the fuck is going on?
What's going on, Joe?

1611
01:44:14,312 --> 01:44:16,856
I can take that, sell it a little at a time...

1612
01:44:16,981 --> 01:44:19,359
...and make a hell of a lot more money.

1613
01:44:19,692 --> 01:44:20,860
What's going on, Joe?

1614
01:44:20,985 --> 01:44:22,070
Elliot's too far away.

1615
01:44:22,152 --> 01:44:25,322
Look, this is the whole ball game,
this is the fucking ball game!

1616
01:44:25,405 --> 01:44:29,410
I'm not saying that you're a drug dealer,
but you're a fucking movie producer.

1617
01:44:29,494 --> 01:44:32,705
And you got access to all kinds
of money and shit like that.

1618
01:44:32,789 --> 01:44:35,166
Shit. Oh, Joe...

1619
01:44:35,375 --> 01:44:37,752
-...you are fucking killing me.
-Wait, wait.

1620
01:44:37,877 --> 01:44:38,878
There, wait, quiet.

1621
01:44:38,961 --> 01:44:41,421
Now, I can't get a million for it,
but you can.

1622
01:44:41,546 --> 01:44:45,300
So I'll sell it to you for $ 200,000.
You go make a million with it.

1623
01:44:46,426 --> 01:44:49,346
Shit, it's all found money to me anyway,
you know?

1624
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:51,348
There he is.

1625
01:44:53,892 --> 01:44:56,811
Me and my wife,
we're minimum-wage kids, you know?

1626
01:44:56,977 --> 01:44:58,771
$ 200,000.
It means the world to us.

1627
01:45:00,815 --> 01:45:03,901
Elliot tells me that you're fronting
for a dirty cop.

1628
01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:08,280
Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anything.

1629
01:45:08,364 --> 01:45:10,324
He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop.

1630
01:45:10,408 --> 01:45:13,035
He saw his chance and he took it,
that's all.

1631
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:14,703
Why does he trust you?

1632
01:45:15,745 --> 01:45:18,123
Well, we grew up together, that's why.

1633
01:45:19,874 --> 01:45:23,713
If you don't know shit, then why
does he think that you can sell it?

1634
01:45:25,965 --> 01:45:27,383
I bullshitted him.

1635
01:45:32,721 --> 01:45:33,888
You're nuts!

1636
01:45:34,055 --> 01:45:36,516
He's a wild man, this kid, Clarence.
I like him.

1637
01:45:36,641 --> 01:45:38,768
-You're wild, I love it.
-Hey, Lee.

1638
01:45:38,935 --> 01:45:42,689
I love this guy, he bullshitted him,
you believe this kid? I love him.

1639
01:45:42,772 --> 01:45:45,150
<i>Elliot, l love this kid.
Monty, get the money.</i>

1640
01:45:45,275 --> 01:45:48,319
That's it, fellas,
let's get these son of a bitches.

1641
01:45:50,237 --> 01:45:52,698
Now wait, wait.
I completely forgot, excuse me.

1642
01:45:52,823 --> 01:45:55,492
-What's your part in this again?
-I'm his wife.

1643
01:45:55,576 --> 01:45:57,411
Oh, you're the wife, right.

1644
01:45:57,494 --> 01:45:58,746
Clarence, Clarence.

1645
01:45:58,829 --> 01:46:00,205
What, did you beat her
or something?

1646
01:46:00,289 --> 01:46:02,666
No, she got that playing basketball.

1647
01:46:04,752 --> 01:46:06,544
-What's the matter with you?
-I'm sorry.

1648
01:46:06,627 --> 01:46:08,004
Why are you here?

1649
01:46:08,546 --> 01:46:09,714
I'm an actor.

1650
01:46:09,922 --> 01:46:14,260
Dick, if you were just a fucking actor,
you would never have got in the room.

1651
01:46:14,552 --> 01:46:16,262
I'm friends with Elliot.

1652
01:46:16,596 --> 01:46:18,806
He's your friend? You got problems.

1653
01:46:19,098 --> 01:46:19,974
All right.

1654
01:46:20,058 --> 01:46:21,851
It's all right. Elliot knows me.

1655
01:46:21,934 --> 01:46:23,643
Elliot, here.

1656
01:46:23,894 --> 01:46:26,938
Call Joe and tell him
that the production manager reports...

1657
01:46:27,022 --> 01:46:28,899
...he's taking 30 cents of every dollar...

1658
01:46:28,982 --> 01:46:31,193
...and putting it in his pocket.

1659
01:46:32,403 --> 01:46:34,447
Don't you want to count your money?

1660
01:46:34,530 --> 01:46:37,158
No, she can count it.
I'm going to the bathroom.

1661
01:46:37,241 --> 01:46:38,493
Give it to her.

1662
01:46:51,046 --> 01:46:52,756
I gotta hand it to you, Clarence.

1663
01:46:52,839 --> 01:46:55,509
-I was cool?
-Man, you were cooler than cool.

1664
01:46:56,343 --> 01:46:58,135
Oh, my God, I forgot my fucking vest.

1665
01:46:58,219 --> 01:46:58,928
Stupid.

1666
01:46:59,011 --> 01:47:00,262
Cody, on three.

1667
01:47:00,429 --> 01:47:02,890
One. Two. Three!

1668
01:47:06,352 --> 01:47:07,812
Put your guns down!

1669
01:47:08,938 --> 01:47:10,523
Get down on the floor!

1670
01:47:11,273 --> 01:47:12,525
Drop your gun!

1671
01:47:12,608 --> 01:47:14,527
Drop your guns and back away!

1672
01:47:15,694 --> 01:47:18,154
Both of you put the fucking guns
on the floor now!

1673
01:47:18,279 --> 01:47:19,280
Fuck you!

1674
01:47:19,364 --> 01:47:21,366
All you pigs! Put your guns on the floor!

1675
01:47:21,449 --> 01:47:23,535
Monty! Are you, nuts?
Do what they say!

1676
01:47:23,618 --> 01:47:24,786
This is your last chance!

1677
01:47:24,869 --> 01:47:26,663
Fuck you, this is your last chance!

1678
01:47:26,746 --> 01:47:27,330
Boris.

1679
01:47:27,414 --> 01:47:29,165
We could kill you all and you know it.

1680
01:47:29,249 --> 01:47:30,959
Get down on the fucking floor!

1681
01:47:31,042 --> 01:47:34,962
Boris, shut the fuck up!
We're all going to die here, these are cops.

1682
01:47:35,212 --> 01:47:37,005
So, they're cops. Who gives a shit!

1683
01:47:37,089 --> 01:47:40,634
Hey, Lee, something I never told you.
I hate fucking cops!

1684
01:47:40,718 --> 01:47:42,512
All right, let's be nice guys, come on.

1685
01:47:42,595 --> 01:47:45,056
Let's be nice.
We don't want anyone to die.

1686
01:47:45,181 --> 01:47:46,891
You look like a blond Frankenstein.

1687
01:47:46,975 --> 01:47:48,768
Put your gun down,
you son of a bitch!

1688
01:47:50,728 --> 01:47:51,730
211?

1689
01:47:51,896 --> 01:47:52,981
Yeah, 211.

1690
01:47:55,108 --> 01:47:56,651
Here you go, Mad Dog.

1691
01:48:06,453 --> 01:48:07,536
Holy shit!

1692
01:48:08,078 --> 01:48:09,246
Motherfucker!

1693
01:48:09,788 --> 01:48:10,956
Who are these guys?

1694
01:48:11,081 --> 01:48:13,542
Put your fucking guns down!
Put 'em down!

1695
01:48:14,084 --> 01:48:16,045
Put 'em down motherfucker!

1696
01:48:16,128 --> 01:48:17,212
Fuck you!

1697
01:48:19,089 --> 01:48:20,883
Put the fucking guns down.

1698
01:48:21,425 --> 01:48:23,761
How do you really think
I'm doing with Lee?

1699
01:48:23,844 --> 01:48:25,970
Are you kidding man? He loves you.

1700
01:48:26,095 --> 01:48:28,181
You don't think I'm kissing his ass, do you?

1701
01:48:28,264 --> 01:48:30,183
You're saying what he wants to hear.

1702
01:48:30,266 --> 01:48:32,894
That ain't the same as kissing his ass.

1703
01:48:33,186 --> 01:48:36,439
I saw Coming Home in a Body Bag,
I loved it, I'm not lying to him.

1704
01:48:36,522 --> 01:48:38,983
No, that's why it's not ass-kissing.

1705
01:48:39,442 --> 01:48:41,360
What you're doing is genuine.

1706
01:48:41,443 --> 01:48:42,819
And he knows it.

1707
01:48:46,490 --> 01:48:48,033
I like you, Clarence.

1708
01:48:48,450 --> 01:48:49,618
Always have.

1709
01:48:50,787 --> 01:48:52,121
Always will.

1710
01:48:57,043 --> 01:48:58,460
Put them down now!

1711
01:49:00,462 --> 01:49:01,713
Put 'em down!

1712
01:49:01,963 --> 01:49:04,132
Put those guns down, motherfuckers!

1713
01:49:05,676 --> 01:49:08,303
Officer Dimes. Officer Dimes.

1714
01:49:08,970 --> 01:49:11,431
Put 'em down, motherfucker!
Put 'em down!

1715
01:49:12,307 --> 01:49:13,141
Officer Dimes!

1716
01:49:13,225 --> 01:49:14,059
What?

1717
01:49:14,142 --> 01:49:15,394
Officer Dimes!

1718
01:49:17,395 --> 01:49:18,479
What?

1719
01:49:19,063 --> 01:49:21,732
This has nothing to do
with me anymore, right?

1720
01:49:21,816 --> 01:49:22,692
Okay.

1721
01:49:22,775 --> 01:49:24,694
So, I'm just going to leave.

1722
01:49:24,819 --> 01:49:26,946
And you guys just settle this
by yourselves.

1723
01:49:27,029 --> 01:49:29,657
Just shut up and stay the fuck put, Elliot!

1724
01:49:29,824 --> 01:49:31,534
How do you know his name?

1725
01:49:31,826 --> 01:49:33,993
Why the fuck did he know your name?

1726
01:49:34,494 --> 01:49:37,247
You little piece of shit!

1727
01:49:37,706 --> 01:49:39,999
You can forget about acting
for the next 20 years!

1728
01:49:40,083 --> 01:49:41,501
Your fucking career is over!

1729
01:49:41,584 --> 01:49:43,962
Take your fuckin' SAG card and burn it!

1730
01:49:44,087 --> 01:49:46,464
You little cocksucker!

1731
01:49:46,881 --> 01:49:50,467
I treated you like a son!
You fucking stabbed me in the heart!

1732
01:49:50,843 --> 01:49:53,303
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

1733
01:49:53,554 --> 01:49:56,181
Motherfucker, don't touch him!
Motherfucker!

1734
01:49:56,849 --> 01:49:57,933
Fuck you!

1735
01:50:03,148 --> 01:50:04,149
Cody!

1736
01:50:30,548 --> 01:50:32,592
Clarence!

1737
01:51:11,963 --> 01:51:12,964
Sweetie!

1738
01:51:14,007 --> 01:51:15,009
Sweetie!

1739
01:51:18,428 --> 01:51:19,513
Baby!

1740
01:51:20,555 --> 01:51:23,642
Okay, you with the shotgun,
behind the couch! Come out!

1741
01:51:23,725 --> 01:51:25,477
<i>Va fangulo!</i>

1742
01:51:26,061 --> 01:51:27,437
The guy is a wop!

1743
01:51:28,647 --> 01:51:31,525
I said come out from behind the couch,
you ginny. Now!

1744
01:51:31,608 --> 01:51:32,859
<i>Fili di putana!</i>

1745
01:51:34,318 --> 01:51:37,613
I said to come out from behind the couch.
Okay? Capisce?

1746
01:51:37,947 --> 01:51:39,281
<i>Aspetta, aspetta...</i>

1747
01:51:40,616 --> 01:51:41,867
Nice and slow!

1748
01:51:52,752 --> 01:51:54,879
Shit! The guy hit me.

1749
01:52:05,056 --> 01:52:06,850
Son of a bitch shot me!

1750
01:52:08,184 --> 01:52:09,351
Sweetie!

1751
01:52:11,812 --> 01:52:13,814
Don't you die on me.

1752
01:52:18,695 --> 01:52:20,405
You're going to be okay.

1753
01:52:21,156 --> 01:52:22,657
I need an ambulance!

1754
01:52:24,075 --> 01:52:25,577
I need an ambulance!

1755
01:52:38,630 --> 01:52:42,009
Fuck you! I'll blow this bitch's brains
to kingdom come!

1756
01:52:47,096 --> 01:52:48,598
I need an ambulance!

1757
01:52:48,681 --> 01:52:49,682
Shut up.

1758
01:52:51,351 --> 01:52:53,061
Fuck you, I'm bleeding!

1759
01:52:53,186 --> 01:52:54,896
I'll call you a hearse.

1760
01:52:57,106 --> 01:52:58,524
This is for Cody.

1761
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:02,444
Fuck you!

1762
01:53:49,532 --> 01:53:51,450
Honey, you're alive!

1763
01:53:55,662 --> 01:53:56,830
I can't see.

1764
01:53:59,791 --> 01:54:02,669
Honey, you have blood in your eye.
Come on.

1765
01:54:08,883 --> 01:54:11,927
Fuck you! I want a car.
Take me to the airport!

1766
01:54:12,219 --> 01:54:13,554
And I want it full of gas!

1767
01:54:20,185 --> 01:54:23,230
And a million bucks!
Small bills! And fast!

1768
01:54:30,653 --> 01:54:33,281
I am going to do this bitch, motherfuckers!

1769
01:55:16,491 --> 01:55:18,700
<i>Amid the chaos of that day...</i>

1770
01:55:18,784 --> 01:55:21,953
<i>...when all l could hear
was the thunder of gunshots...</i>

1771
01:55:22,037 --> 01:55:25,207
<i>...and all l could smell
was the violence in the air...</i>

1772
01:55:25,457 --> 01:55:27,459
<i>...l look back and am amazed...</i>

1773
01:55:27,834 --> 01:55:30,545
<i>...that my thoughts were so clear and true.</i>

1774
01:55:30,921 --> 01:55:33,757
<i>That three words went
through my mind endlessly.</i>

1775
01:55:34,549 --> 01:55:37,510
<i>Repeating themselves like a broken record.</i>

1776
01:55:37,885 --> 01:55:39,136
<i>You're so cool.</i>

1777
01:55:40,304 --> 01:55:41,639
<i>You're so cool.</i>

1778
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:43,891
<i>You're so cool.</i>

1779
01:55:46,561 --> 01:55:50,482
<i>And sometimes Clarence asks me
what would l have done if he had died.</i>

1780
01:55:50,607 --> 01:55:53,651
<i>lf that bullet had been
two inches more to the left.</i>

1781
01:55:54,443 --> 01:55:56,153
<i>To this, l always smile.</i>

1782
01:55:56,529 --> 01:55:59,532
<i>As if l'm not going to satisfy him
with a response.</i>

1783
01:55:59,865 --> 01:56:01,784
<i>But l always do.</i>

1784
01:56:01,867 --> 01:56:04,245
<i>l tell him of how l would want to die.</i>

1785
01:56:04,578 --> 01:56:07,790
<i>But that the anguish
and the want of death would fade...</i>

1786
01:56:07,999 --> 01:56:09,959
<i>...like the stars at dawn.</i>

1787
01:56:10,667 --> 01:56:13,503
<i>And that things would be
much like they are now.</i>

1788
01:56:14,004 --> 01:56:15,171
<i>Perhaps.</i>

1789
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:18,633
<i>Except maybe l wouldn't have
named our son...</i>

1790
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,719
<i>...Elvis.</i>
