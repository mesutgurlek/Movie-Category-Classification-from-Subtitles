1
00:06:50,928 --> 00:06:52,919
"Good morning, Columbus."

2
00:06:54,888 --> 00:06:58,642
My mother's eternal words, reminding
me America was already discovered,

3
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:02,398
and that day-dreaming
was a long way from life's truths.

4
00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:06,636
Why tell me the difference
between an apple and a bicycle?

5
00:07:07,088 --> 00:07:10,444
If I bite a bicycle and ride an apple,
I'll know the difference.

6
00:07:11,088 --> 00:07:14,717
But thinking about what to do made me
more tired than actually doing.

7
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,717
I remember my father said:
If you want to look at someone's soul,

8
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:21,045
you have to look at their dreams.

9
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:24,685
Then you'd have mercy for those
who swim in bigger shit than your own.

10
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:29,604
My name is Axel Blackmar, and I work
for the Department of Fish and Game.

11
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:33,597
Most people think I count fish,
but I don't.

12
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:38,087
I look at their souls, their dreams
and then I let them into my dreams.

13
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:42,962
People think fish are stupid, but they
aren't. They know when to be quiet,

14
00:07:43,408 --> 00:07:47,560
It's people that are stupid. Fish know
everything, and don't need to think.

15
00:07:48,688 --> 00:07:52,840
See, fish start out in small streams,
then I prepare them for the ocean.

16
00:07:53,288 --> 00:07:56,439
When they're ready to die,
they return to where they came from.

17
00:07:56,888 --> 00:08:00,642
That's my connection,
that's why I swam away to the city.

18
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:02,919
Okay, here's my job:

19
00:08:03,368 --> 00:08:05,438
All I do
is temporarily electrocute the fish,

20
00:08:05,888 --> 00:08:09,722
then with deep respect, I scoop 'em
and haul 'em in, one by one...

21
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:13,956
Sometimes I'll look into fish eyes
and I'll see my whole life.

22
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:17,326
It's something only fish can show us,
and I love 'em for it.

23
00:08:17,768 --> 00:08:21,920
I tag the fish, measure 'em and weigh
'em, make sure they're doing okay.

24
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:27,158
If they want to talk, I always listen.
That's the job of a Fish God.

25
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,678
I've never caught a fish in a lie,

26
00:08:30,128 --> 00:08:33,006
and I've never seen a fish
swim in the shit that human people do.

27
00:08:33,928 --> 00:08:36,965
That's why I love my work,
and I love New York.

28
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:41,560
Not because my mother said it was
a place with real magnetic pull,

29
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:45,444
but because you can see everybody,
and nobody can see you.

30
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:54,324
Hey, honey! How are you?
How was Istanbul?

31
00:08:56,608 --> 00:09:01,318
I'm looking for my girlfriend, Suzanne
Supak. I just spoke with her. Over.

32
00:09:01,768 --> 00:09:03,918
I love you too, honey.

33
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:10,041
I miss you too, honey. Over.
Two more, please!

34
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:12,879
Pregnant? Wow! Over.

35
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:16,323
Listen, honey...

36
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:18,918
Alright, let's go.
- Have the abortion...

37
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:22,041
I'm not going.
- Come on! We're running late!

38
00:09:22,488 --> 00:09:24,444
I said I'm not going.

39
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:29,678
You said you're not going?
- I said I'm not going.

40
00:09:30,128 --> 00:09:32,244
I'm not going.
- You're not going?

41
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:35,600
Are you going to go or no?

42
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:40,957
Are you gonna shoot me?
- Am I? - You're going to kill me?

43
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:46,645
These things. I don't even...
It's a blank.

44
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:49,921
But I had you scared, right?

45
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:54,245
Let me feel.
You shit your pants.

46
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:04,122
"Take care of me"...
I'm fuckin' sick of it!

47
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:05,923
What?

48
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:09,881
He's your uncle, for Chrissakes.

49
00:10:10,728 --> 00:10:14,846
If he wants to see me,
why did he send you?

50
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:17,878
You know it wasn't his fault, right?

51
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:22,162
I don't blame him for anything, Paul.
I never said it was his fault.

52
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:25,441
He's marrying,
and wants you as his best man.

53
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:31,087
You be his best man. - Why are you
like that? You're killing him!

54
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,278
Alright, Axel! Axel, listen.

55
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:40,003
End of story! Over!

56
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,963
I love you too!

57
00:10:45,408 --> 00:10:49,481
I'm going to go back
and tell him I couldn't find you.

58
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:52,044
Really?
- Really. I have no choice.

59
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:56,527
Promise? - I promise.
What about a hug? No hug for me?

60
00:10:57,728 --> 00:11:00,481
Axel, you smell like a scumbag!

61
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:05,046
I'm a happy scumbag. I got a nice
truck, a great job. - But you smell.

62
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:08,926
What're you gonna have?
- Two beers. - Two beers, OK.

63
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,404
And a ginger ale.
- Two beers and...

64
00:11:11,848 --> 00:11:14,408
Forget the ginger ale.
Two beers and two shots. - Blanche?

65
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:16,600
Two...
- Who's the boss?

66
00:11:17,048 --> 00:11:20,279
I am. - He is. 2 beers, 2 shots.
- And a ginger ale.

67
00:11:20,728 --> 00:11:22,161
2 beers, 2 shots.

68
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:26,237
And a ginger ale. - Don't confuse her.
- A ginger ale please?

69
00:11:26,688 --> 00:11:29,760
Anyway, Axel, I love you, but...

70
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,325
What? I love you too.
- Okay, well, you know... ginger ale.

71
00:11:34,168 --> 00:11:38,400
That's right. 2 beers and 2 shots.
- And a ginger ale.

72
00:11:38,848 --> 00:11:42,045
"2 beers and 2 shots." What's that?
What? - That thing...

73
00:11:42,528 --> 00:11:44,439
What thing?
- Like a funny accent or something.

74
00:11:44,888 --> 00:11:48,324
What funny accent thing?
- "2 beers and 2 shots." - What?

75
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:51,163
I dunno... like New York.

76
00:11:52,248 --> 00:11:55,206
Funny New York accent, huh?
- Yeah.

77
00:11:55,768 --> 00:12:00,284
Is De Niro funny? Is Pacino funny?
Is Rocky funny?

78
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:04,000
The great actors are all
from New York. - Sinatra?

79
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:07,645
Sinatra's from Hoboken, New Jersey.
Now let's toast.

80
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:11,839
Alright? It's been three years, OK?
- Three years.

81
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:15,605
To three years.
- Three years.

82
00:12:19,568 --> 00:12:21,604
Blanche, ginger ale.

83
00:12:24,448 --> 00:12:25,767
Two shots.

84
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,280
We don't see each other 3 years,
and you want ginger ale.

85
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:33,721
Thank you, Blanche. - Thanks for the
ginger ale. - You're welcome, boys.

86
00:12:43,168 --> 00:12:45,523
Gimme a hug.
I'll plug my nose.

87
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:50,122
Back to the dream.

88
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:55,037
The man gives the stomach balloon
to the little boy.

89
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,917
Pushes him out of the igloo.

90
00:12:58,368 --> 00:13:02,441
While the kid is outside,
the two inside start, y'know...

91
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:06,918
Alright! Stop yelling,
we're on Broadway. Show respect.

92
00:15:02,488 --> 00:15:06,640
Therefore, I know you're all
dying for a piece of wedding cake...

93
00:15:07,088 --> 00:15:10,524
So I will make this short and sweet.

94
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:13,846
Millie,

95
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,767
dear friends,

96
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:20,281
waiters and waitresses, I'd like to
propose this wedding toast...

97
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:23,526
Leo!
- Not now, Millie.

98
00:15:27,128 --> 00:15:29,084
Come on!

99
00:15:31,368 --> 00:15:34,121
Hey! Don't fuck around!

100
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:38,687
Cut it out!
Don't be a jerk! Cut it out!

101
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:45,122
I got an audition coming up!
You're lucky I don't kick your ass...

102
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:47,167
Cut it out! Axel!

103
00:15:47,688 --> 00:15:50,441
You want me to come down?
- Come on down!

104
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:53,322
Stop shaking the ladder!
- Axel!

105
00:15:53,768 --> 00:15:54,917
I'm coming down!
- Leo!

106
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:57,279
My boy!
- Axel!

107
00:15:57,728 --> 00:15:59,127
I can't believe it!

108
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:06,639
You got big on me!

109
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:09,886
You heard about the wedding?
- I did. Congratulations.

110
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:14,765
I'd be proud if you'd be my best man.
- I gotta get back to New York.

111
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:19,167
Sure... Larry, we have to make
Axel an appointment for a fitting.

112
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:21,599
Honestly, Leo, I've got to go.

113
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:25,085
It's so good to see you, Axel.
You look terrific, Axel.

114
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:28,520
I just want to show you something.
I want to share this with you.

115
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:31,436
What do you think about my Saguro?

116
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:33,844
The cactus?
- Nice, huh?

117
00:16:34,288 --> 00:16:36,404
Let me let you in on a secret:

118
00:16:36,848 --> 00:16:40,841
When a cactus is that young,
it is very vulnerable. That's why

119
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:44,280
I planted that Mesquite tree
right next to it, for protection.

120
00:16:44,728 --> 00:16:48,960
If you don't see an older tree nearby
a new cactus, you can forget it.

121
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:50,887
It ain't gonna make it.

122
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:54,684
Come on inside.
Somebody's dyin' to meet you.

123
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:59,718
Millie! I'd like you to meet
my nephew Axel.

124
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:02,159
Axel, this is Millie.

125
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:05,516
How do you do?

126
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:14,080
Aren't you overdoing it just a little,
Millie? - Oh, sorry.

127
00:17:14,528 --> 00:17:16,803
Come on, sit down next to me, Axel.

128
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:22,047
Lemme get a pair of pants on first...

129
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:31,317
Stop singing!
- I'm not singing. I count!

130
00:17:31,768 --> 00:17:33,406
Count the stitches!

131
00:17:33,848 --> 00:17:37,841
You've been on that jacket
for a week. Finish it!

132
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:40,438
Bye bye anybody...

133
00:17:51,648 --> 00:17:55,402
Sorry for interrupting
you two, but I had to get my pants on.

134
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,518
Leo's told me so much about you.

135
00:18:01,968 --> 00:18:04,801
I guess you know
I'm gonna be your new aunt.

136
00:18:07,448 --> 00:18:10,918
You're his... fiancée.

137
00:18:11,368 --> 00:18:12,562
Yeah.

138
00:18:16,448 --> 00:18:20,157
You don't have to call me Aunt Mille,
though. Unless you want to.

139
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:26,767
How old are you?
- Twenty three.

140
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:32,881
We're almost the same age...

141
00:18:34,328 --> 00:18:36,205
Isn't that funny?

142
00:18:40,168 --> 00:18:43,763
Millie, please.
Remember we talked about this?

143
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:49,077
I'm sorry, Leo. Just a second.

144
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:54,568
Leo's trying to teach me
how to stop crying.

145
00:18:55,008 --> 00:19:01,322
Sweetheart, go in the other room
and try on the other dress for Axel.

146
00:19:04,648 --> 00:19:06,286
That'll get your mind off...

147
00:19:06,768 --> 00:19:12,479
Go in the other room, sweetheart,
and try the other dress on.

148
00:19:12,928 --> 00:19:18,878
It'll take your mind off crying.
It's in the other room!

149
00:19:22,008 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm going.
- Do me the favor.

150
00:19:40,408 --> 00:19:44,640
You know, Axel, my little Polish
cupcake is very sensitive...

151
00:19:45,088 --> 00:19:47,556
...like the Eastern Europeans are.

152
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:51,682
But she's very nice, right?
- Very nice, Leo.

153
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:55,162
And you know how old she is?
- She's young.

154
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:57,439
Damn right. That's success.

155
00:19:57,888 --> 00:20:01,881
To achieve that success, you need
to sell cars. - I don't want to.

156
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:08,198
Axel, my father had the first Cadillac
dealership in Arizona in 1914!

157
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:11,924
He had this magnificent dream,
to sell as many cars as he could,

158
00:20:12,368 --> 00:20:16,441
and stack them up until they got high
enough so he could walk to the moon.

159
00:20:16,888 --> 00:20:21,245
Isn't it beautiful? - Very beautiful,
Leo. But they'd topple over.

160
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,282
That's what I said,
but he wanted me in the business,

161
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:26,684
and I resisted,
like you're resisting me.

162
00:20:27,128 --> 00:20:30,120
I'm not resisting, Leo.
I just don't want to sell cars.

163
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:33,640
What the hell are you afraid of?
- Nothing.

164
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,482
One thing I was sure of,

165
00:20:40,928 --> 00:20:43,920
my uncle Leo was definitely
the hero of my childhood.

166
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:50,562
The smell of his "Old Spice" carried
me back more than the home movies did.

167
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:56,558
It was the sweet, cheap smell
of car dealers that took me back,

168
00:20:57,008 --> 00:20:59,397
and made me dissolve into the past.

169
00:21:00,488 --> 00:21:03,605
Leo was the last dinosaur
that smelled of cheap cologne.

170
00:21:04,048 --> 00:21:06,801
And he believed in the American dream.

171
00:21:07,248 --> 00:21:09,887
I was crazy about him,
because he believed in miracles.

172
00:21:10,328 --> 00:21:13,525
Even though he lived inside
of life and sold Cadillacs,

173
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:18,246
he always looked like a 10-year-old
boy whose sleeves were too long.

174
00:21:18,688 --> 00:21:20,804
Leo gave me this movie camera.

175
00:21:21,248 --> 00:21:24,081
My mother always hoped
I'd become the next Milton Berle.

176
00:21:24,528 --> 00:21:28,680
But dreams of houses, cars, and lawns
aren't dreams when they become real.

177
00:21:29,128 --> 00:21:33,724
I understood what my mother
meant by "Good morning, Columbus."

178
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:38,798
Even if she didn't like what I was
doing, I think she'd understand me.

179
00:22:25,448 --> 00:22:29,521
When I was 11, I got this really weird
earache that wouldn't go away.

180
00:22:29,968 --> 00:22:32,721
A hundred doctors couldn't help me...

181
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:35,363
So Leo went into Mexico,

182
00:22:35,808 --> 00:22:40,006
and brought back this fat lady
witch doctor who fixed me right up.

183
00:22:40,848 --> 00:22:44,045
I was grateful, but I thought
I might've been better off mute.

184
00:22:44,848 --> 00:22:47,237
All in all,
I had a very happy childhood.

185
00:22:48,008 --> 00:22:52,206
My dad, a border guard, spent his life
trying to stop people crossing lines.

186
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:57,046
For 15 years, he'd smooth down
the road between Mexico and Arizona,

187
00:22:57,488 --> 00:23:00,878
and every morning he'd be out there
looking for footprints in the dirt.

188
00:23:01,328 --> 00:23:04,206
But my father always said that work
was like a hat you put on your head.

189
00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:09,403
And even without pants, you didn't
have to be ashamed of your ass.

190
00:23:10,928 --> 00:23:13,158
One thing I was sure about:

191
00:23:14,008 --> 00:23:17,398
The moment my parents died,
my childhood was gone forever.

192
00:23:19,368 --> 00:23:22,326
Leo could never shake the guilt
of my parents' death 6 years ago.

193
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:25,562
Leo was driving the car that night.

194
00:23:26,008 --> 00:23:29,842
It got so bad that he even felt guilty
if he used too much shaving cream.

195
00:23:30,288 --> 00:23:33,963
Four days after the funeral,
I caught a train to New York City.

196
00:23:34,768 --> 00:23:39,159
If somebody asked me why I don't
take the next train back to New York,

197
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:42,281
it's because you can't say no
to your childhood hero.

198
00:23:42,728 --> 00:23:45,845
I decided to be his best man,
but one thing I was sure of:

199
00:23:46,288 --> 00:23:48,643
No matter how much I loved
the smell of cheap cologne,

200
00:23:49,088 --> 00:23:53,525
I was never going to become my uncle,
and I would never sell Cadillacs.

201
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:02,844
Axel, if I died tomorrow,
where would you be?

202
00:24:14,928 --> 00:24:16,919
You're not gonna die tomorrow.

203
00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:19,928
Who knows when I'll die?

204
00:24:20,368 --> 00:24:23,804
Your mother and father didn't.
- That was an accident.

205
00:24:24,248 --> 00:24:27,479
No, it was stupidity. I shouldn't
have been behind that wheel.

206
00:24:27,928 --> 00:24:30,362
Please, no guilt. Please.

207
00:24:35,448 --> 00:24:36,403
Look,

208
00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:41,876
I'm not going to allow you
to become a bum in New York.

209
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:47,040
I want you to stay here with me.
Try it for one week.

210
00:24:47,488 --> 00:24:50,639
If you don't like it,
then you go home.

211
00:24:51,088 --> 00:24:52,919
Okay?

212
00:25:06,368 --> 00:25:10,247
Axel, make "busy." Very, very busy.
- Hello.

213
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:13,761
Busy, but "willing to take time out
from your schedule," Axel.

214
00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:21,603
Hello.

215
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:25,081
Axel, make "sexy."

216
00:25:33,328 --> 00:25:35,523
Try it with your lips,
pucker them up..."Hello."

217
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:42,082
No,
more with the lips, you know, "Hello."

218
00:25:44,768 --> 00:25:48,044
Axel, I'm a gorgeous woman,
and I have big, beautiful breasts.

219
00:25:48,488 --> 00:25:50,126
Now do "sexy."

220
00:25:52,048 --> 00:25:54,516
No, Axel. Breasts.

221
00:26:10,968 --> 00:26:13,562
You're talking art,
you're talking gravity.

222
00:26:19,448 --> 00:26:23,885
You see this? - Yeah. Banana.
- Proteins, proteins...

223
00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:27,807
Your organs
produce a certain amount of proteins.

224
00:26:28,248 --> 00:26:32,321
Well, when you see a beautiful woman,
you produce extra proteins.

225
00:26:32,768 --> 00:26:35,919
These extra proteins
go directly to your brain.

226
00:26:36,368 --> 00:26:39,485
Where do you get all this stuff?
- Scientific fact.

227
00:26:39,928 --> 00:26:43,159
Anyway, I've figured out a way
to make it work for me.

228
00:26:43,608 --> 00:26:45,803
I call it "The Gaze."

229
00:26:46,248 --> 00:26:48,716
You look into a woman's eyes,
and you think exactly

230
00:26:49,168 --> 00:26:51,728
what you want her to do for you.

231
00:27:32,688 --> 00:27:37,808
You're an actor?
Oh my God, he's an actor!

232
00:27:38,608 --> 00:27:43,284
In 12 days, I have a gigantic
performance I'm doing in Tucson.

233
00:27:43,848 --> 00:27:46,282
Maybe you'd like to come and see me?

234
00:27:46,728 --> 00:27:52,121
It's an audition. - What have
we seen you in? Movies, TV shows?

235
00:27:52,568 --> 00:27:56,800
Do you go to foreign films? - No.
- I'm a major star in Europe.

236
00:27:57,248 --> 00:27:58,601
Foreign films?

237
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:01,646
Yeah, foreign films.

238
00:28:15,088 --> 00:28:16,885
Come here, close to me.

239
00:28:18,128 --> 00:28:19,925
Feel better now?

240
00:28:21,768 --> 00:28:23,565
Feel better now?

241
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:28,676
You like that?
Don't touch my face, okay?

242
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:32,486
Oh, come on!
- No, I'm not kidding.

243
00:28:32,928 --> 00:28:36,079
We can make love,
but don't touch my face or my hair.

244
00:28:36,528 --> 00:28:40,316
Are all actors like that?
- All the great actors are.

245
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:46,120
Do you think anybody touches
Brando's face? Or Pacino's?

246
00:28:46,568 --> 00:28:51,164
Do they touch De Niro's face?
Or fucking touch Johnny Depp's face?

247
00:28:51,608 --> 00:28:55,806
No one's gonna touch
Paul Leger's face, okay?

248
00:29:03,128 --> 00:29:04,766
I'm missing my favorite scene...

249
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:08,723
I'm telling you, if I hear anything,
I swear I'm gonna kill somebody...

250
00:29:09,168 --> 00:29:11,807
Go ahead and kill everybody!
You're the tough guy!

251
00:29:12,248 --> 00:29:13,761
Kill Vicky, kill Salvy,

252
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:16,164
Tommy Como, and me while you're at it!

253
00:29:16,608 --> 00:29:20,044
You're killing yourself,
the way you eat, you fat fuck!

254
00:29:20,488 --> 00:29:22,683
What do you mean "kill you"?

255
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,083
Me, kill me!

256
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:28,521
Start here! Do me a fuckin' favor!
- You meant something.

257
00:29:29,048 --> 00:29:32,927
You mentioned Tommy, Salvy,
and you included you with them.

258
00:29:33,408 --> 00:29:36,127
You could have said anybody,
but you said you and them.

259
00:29:37,848 --> 00:29:39,918
You've let this girl ruin your life.

260
00:29:40,368 --> 00:29:42,199
She really did some job on you!

261
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:45,845
Look what she did to you!
- You fucked my wife.

262
00:29:46,288 --> 00:29:47,516
You fucked my wife?

263
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,644
I'm not going to answer.
It's a sick question.

264
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:56,399
I'm gonna leave.

265
00:29:56,848 --> 00:29:58,042
Very nice!

266
00:29:58,488 --> 00:30:02,163
You won't have troubles in your bed,
so don't pick it out on me!

267
00:30:23,008 --> 00:30:24,885
Pig, pig, pig! Here!

268
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:52,082
Hello.
- Hello there.

269
00:30:53,088 --> 00:30:55,477
Adrian Del Monica.
- How do you do?

270
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:04,405
I'm not seein' it.
- It's right in front of you!

271
00:31:04,848 --> 00:31:10,047
Yeah, but the vibe...
It's all wrong.

272
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:20,406
Mine is a '66, and it's old!
I need a new one!

273
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:24,516
I'm not giving you any more.
500 dollars, that's it.

274
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:27,243
Are you listening to me?

275
00:31:27,688 --> 00:31:30,202
Don't even think about this, Mother!

276
00:31:30,648 --> 00:31:33,685
I can look if I want to.
- Get out! You cannot pay for this.

277
00:31:34,128 --> 00:31:37,279
Yes I can!
- No you can't, Mother!

278
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:41,004
We made a deal, 500 dollars.
- I don't know, well...

279
00:31:41,448 --> 00:31:44,042
How are you going to pay for this?
- With your money.

280
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:46,479
Which is half mine.
- You know what, Mother?

281
00:31:46,928 --> 00:31:50,000
Fuck you! - Hello, Axel Blackmar.
- Fuck you, too!

282
00:31:50,448 --> 00:31:55,647
What a beautiful dress. - I didn't
come here for cheap compliments.

283
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:59,524
I wasn't complimenting you. Sorry.
Forgive me if I've offended you.

284
00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:05,124
I'm sorry.
- You break, you pay! - No.

285
00:32:05,568 --> 00:32:07,320
Something wrong with it?

286
00:32:10,448 --> 00:32:13,997
Yeah, it's funny.
- Thank you. That's very nice.

287
00:32:14,448 --> 00:32:18,407
Okay, right.
The undercoating looks pretty good.

288
00:32:19,368 --> 00:32:21,120
The suspension is funny.

289
00:32:21,568 --> 00:32:25,527
Look, the right wheel, see?
It's lower than the left. - It is.

290
00:32:25,968 --> 00:32:27,162
It's true.

291
00:32:27,608 --> 00:32:31,362
I didn't mean to insult. I just wanted
to tell you how beautiful you look.

292
00:32:31,808 --> 00:32:34,720
Are you going to sell me a car or not?
- Yes.

293
00:32:35,168 --> 00:32:36,840
Hello, Elaine.
- Hi!

294
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,563
I didn't know you worked here.
- Temporary.

295
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:42,920
Can you hold on a sec?
I'll be right with you.

296
00:32:43,968 --> 00:32:47,040
Keep the daughter busy.
- No. She's my first customer.

297
00:32:47,488 --> 00:32:50,161
The woman knows my face.
It's better for the sale.

298
00:32:50,608 --> 00:32:54,203
It's better if I do it!
- Don't ever touch my suit.

299
00:32:54,648 --> 00:32:57,606
Do me a favor,
keep the daughter busy.

300
00:32:58,848 --> 00:33:01,646
Elaine, do you want to step outside?
- Sure.

301
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:06,320
Why's he looking at me like that?
- Oh, he's a kid. He's...

302
00:33:16,408 --> 00:33:18,285
You ever think about suicide?

303
00:33:18,728 --> 00:33:20,958
Excuse me?
- Suicide.

304
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,603
Not recently.

305
00:33:24,648 --> 00:33:28,482
I think about it all the time.
I want to come back as a turtle.

306
00:33:29,368 --> 00:33:32,087
Turtles are very nice.
- Yes, they're the best.

307
00:33:33,848 --> 00:33:39,161
She's not my real mother.
She married my father. He's dead.

308
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:44,397
Both my parents are dead.
- You sure become your parents.

309
00:33:44,848 --> 00:33:49,080
Even if they're not your real parents.
I'm gonna kill myself before that.

310
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:53,203
Really? - Yup.
- Do you think you're overreacting?

311
00:33:57,968 --> 00:33:59,924
I don't have another match.

312
00:34:00,928 --> 00:34:03,488
Look at my hands!
These aren't my hands.

313
00:34:03,928 --> 00:34:05,486
These are her hands.

314
00:34:06,968 --> 00:34:09,607
Do you like my legs?
I hate them!

315
00:34:10,608 --> 00:34:12,485
Sometimes I'll be sitting,

316
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:15,840
and I'll look down,
and they're crossed just like hers.

317
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:19,678
She does have nice legs.
- Yes, she does.

318
00:34:20,848 --> 00:34:23,203
What's so bad
about becoming your mother?

319
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:26,924
Just wait. One day you'll wake up,
and you'll be your father.

320
00:34:27,888 --> 00:34:31,005
Wrong. My uncle is my only family.
- What does he do?

321
00:34:31,448 --> 00:34:34,201
He owns this place.
- See what I mean?

322
00:34:35,248 --> 00:34:38,797
My father owned the 3rd largest
copper mine in Arizona.

323
00:34:39,248 --> 00:34:42,365
Now I own the 3rd largest
copper mine in Arizona.

324
00:34:42,808 --> 00:34:46,005
You're an idiot if you think
you can escape it.

325
00:34:46,448 --> 00:34:48,439
Don't call me an idiot.

326
00:34:51,968 --> 00:34:53,447
Look, man...

327
00:34:53,888 --> 00:34:55,640
I gave you pazzazz,

328
00:34:56,088 --> 00:34:58,556
I offered you excitement,
vibes,

329
00:34:59,008 --> 00:35:00,726
sexy good-looking,

330
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:05,958
I even gave you Waaaaaagaaanganngg!
What else could you want in a car?

331
00:35:06,408 --> 00:35:08,922
Good gas mileage. That's important.

332
00:35:09,728 --> 00:35:11,878
Mr. Del Monica, look at my lips.

333
00:35:12,608 --> 00:35:14,121
They're gonna say:

334
00:35:14,568 --> 00:35:19,688
Take your whsshht and get off my lot,
before I punch you!

335
00:35:20,128 --> 00:35:21,322
Now git!

336
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:23,801
Are you sore?
- Out! Out!

337
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:33,398
Buy a Ford!

338
00:35:34,688 --> 00:35:37,327
It's disgusting.
Isn't it disgusting?

339
00:35:37,968 --> 00:35:40,118
Goodbye, chickenhead.
- Axel.

340
00:35:40,568 --> 00:35:44,197
Hey Elaine, I was wondering...
I know we just met,

341
00:35:44,648 --> 00:35:50,166
but I was wondering if the two of us
could meet for a picnic or a soirée?

342
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:53,361
I don't think so.
Goodbye, Paul.

343
00:36:00,288 --> 00:36:03,644
What the fuck was that? - What?
- I was waiting for that woman.

344
00:36:04,088 --> 00:36:07,364
Why was the door locked?
- She was making a phone call.

345
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,877
Really?

346
00:36:09,328 --> 00:36:11,967
Gentlemen, new showroom policy:
As of today,

347
00:36:12,408 --> 00:36:15,366
if any customers
come in dressed casually,

348
00:36:15,808 --> 00:36:19,926
they're yours. Starting now.
Clear the area.

349
00:36:29,808 --> 00:36:32,527
Did you know
that the warriors in Papua New Guinea

350
00:36:32,968 --> 00:36:35,357
avoid eating turtle meat before battle?

351
00:36:35,808 --> 00:36:38,527
They believe
that turtles are very shy,

352
00:36:38,968 --> 00:36:40,640
and if they eat the meat,

353
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:44,000
their enemies will become shy,
and run away.

354
00:36:45,248 --> 00:36:48,558
Did you know that?
- Well, it is fascinating.

355
00:36:49,008 --> 00:36:53,559
A Papua New Guinea story!
- It's "Papua." - I don't give a shit!

356
00:36:54,008 --> 00:37:00,163
Wait! Isn't that the place where the
village boys go into the woods,

357
00:37:00,608 --> 00:37:07,207
and they build a giant lean-to...
a shack. - That's right!

358
00:37:07,648 --> 00:37:11,038
Then they take a woman
they've captured from another village,

359
00:37:11,488 --> 00:37:13,126
and they put her inside the lean-to.

360
00:37:13,568 --> 00:37:18,164
And then every boy in the village
goes in to lose his virginity.

361
00:37:18,608 --> 00:37:23,887
When the last boy in line is inside,
the rest go to the shack and knock...

362
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:26,080
You know the rest?
- Yes.

363
00:37:26,528 --> 00:37:28,439
Why do they knock it down?

364
00:37:28,888 --> 00:37:33,404
Because they eat the poor bastard
who was last, and the girl.

365
00:37:33,848 --> 00:37:36,726
Nice.
- But they're natives. Natives.

366
00:37:39,888 --> 00:37:42,118
Oops! I've lost my napkin!

367
00:38:29,088 --> 00:38:32,398
There's plenty of room here.
Why don't you move apart?

368
00:38:32,848 --> 00:38:34,520
We're fine.

369
00:38:34,968 --> 00:38:36,367
Grace!

370
00:38:38,768 --> 00:38:42,522
Axel, tell them the Eskimo movie
dream thing. - Why don't you, Paul?

371
00:38:42,968 --> 00:38:44,799
Well, I'd love to hear it!

372
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,637
Oh yes!
My mother loves bed-time stories.

373
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:49,522
Go on, Axel.

374
00:38:51,568 --> 00:38:54,128
This Eskimo, Dooey, is fishing...

375
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:58,763
through a hole in the ice,
and he catches this fish

376
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:02,837
with both eyes on the same side
of its head. - I'm sorry.

377
00:39:03,288 --> 00:39:07,247
But is that a real fish?
- Yes, it's a real fish.

378
00:39:07,688 --> 00:39:09,883
And there's a storm coming,

379
00:39:10,328 --> 00:39:14,606
so Dooey gets on his dog sled,
and travels through the ice.

380
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:16,163
Stop!

381
00:39:16,608 --> 00:39:18,564
Grow up! Mother, now!
- Mind your own business!

382
00:39:19,008 --> 00:39:22,523
...he builds a fire,
and the snow from the tree falls down

383
00:39:22,968 --> 00:39:25,084
and puts the fire out.
- Jesus.

384
00:39:25,528 --> 00:39:27,439
Sweetheart, go play.

385
00:39:28,008 --> 00:39:30,522
Is that it?
- No. So now Dooey is dying,

386
00:39:33,768 --> 00:39:35,645
and his dog hypnotizes him,

387
00:39:36,088 --> 00:39:38,283
and brings him back to the igloo,

388
00:39:38,728 --> 00:39:40,639
where his wife rubs

389
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:45,206
his body with a sponge,
and brings him back to life.

390
00:39:49,328 --> 00:39:50,283
That's beautiful.

391
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:52,436
It is beautiful.

392
00:40:04,968 --> 00:40:09,359
What was that?
- My hand slipped. - A kid.

393
00:40:10,048 --> 00:40:11,845
A kid. Beautiful.

394
00:40:21,808 --> 00:40:24,845
It must give you great pleasure
to be the life of the party, Mother.

395
00:40:25,288 --> 00:40:26,357
What party?

396
00:40:26,808 --> 00:40:29,322
Why must you try to screw

397
00:40:29,768 --> 00:40:31,645
every man you see under 30?
- Grace,

398
00:40:32,088 --> 00:40:34,727
in Papua New Guinea, it's
considered a right of passage...

399
00:40:35,168 --> 00:40:37,523
I don't want to hear it!

400
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:42,160
In Papua New Guinea,
if a woman wants to go to bed

401
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:45,042
with a young man, she can.
- Stop it!

402
00:40:45,488 --> 00:40:47,001
If she's older, it's okay!

403
00:40:47,448 --> 00:40:51,964
If you fucking say it one more time,
I'm going to smash this table now!

404
00:40:55,968 --> 00:40:57,037
Let go!

405
00:41:23,408 --> 00:41:26,241
Paul, maybe we should go...
- Sit down! - Go!

406
00:41:26,688 --> 00:41:28,041
Sit.
- Go!

407
00:41:28,608 --> 00:41:32,078
No! You're not invited! Go!
- Sit!

408
00:41:32,528 --> 00:41:35,725
I think we should stay here tonight.
- No! You're not invited!

409
00:41:36,168 --> 00:41:38,124
My friends can stay if they want.

410
00:41:38,568 --> 00:41:42,447
You are disgusting. An immature girl
in a sagging, old body!

411
00:41:42,888 --> 00:41:46,847
You're a pale imitation of a young me.
- Except I didn't kill my husband!

412
00:41:47,288 --> 00:41:49,199
Tell your fucking new friends

413
00:41:49,648 --> 00:41:52,879
what that's like! - Shut up!
- No, you go ahead!

414
00:41:53,328 --> 00:41:54,363
Shut up, Grace!

415
00:41:54,808 --> 00:41:59,882
You're disgusting! - Shut up!
- No, 'cuz I said it!

416
00:42:01,168 --> 00:42:04,717
If it hadn't been for you,
he'd still be alive!

417
00:42:06,048 --> 00:42:07,003
Fuck.

418
00:42:13,328 --> 00:42:17,367
That's it.
I'm gonna kill myself right now.

419
00:42:17,808 --> 00:42:19,526
Okay, good.

420
00:42:22,128 --> 00:42:25,359
Go ahead!
I'll give you a nice funeral.

421
00:42:27,568 --> 00:42:33,006
I'm sure you will. But you're
not getting any of my money!

422
00:42:33,448 --> 00:42:36,246
I don't care. What else is new?

423
00:42:36,968 --> 00:42:39,277
Look, Mom! See?

424
00:42:40,048 --> 00:42:41,527
She's taking down her panty hose.

425
00:42:41,968 --> 00:42:46,359
I'm so glad I'll be dead for your
birthday! - Your best present ever!

426
00:42:46,808 --> 00:42:48,446
This is it, Mom! Goodbye!

427
00:42:56,288 --> 00:42:57,437
Get away!

428
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:02,647
Look, Mom!

429
00:43:03,088 --> 00:43:05,318
She has her panties around her neck!

430
00:43:06,088 --> 00:43:07,043
I'm eating!

431
00:43:07,488 --> 00:43:09,877
You're desperate and sick, Mom.

432
00:43:10,328 --> 00:43:15,004
You're sick. I can't live this way.
I don't want to live this way.

433
00:43:15,448 --> 00:43:18,918
Why don't you have some dignity?
- I'm not living this way.

434
00:43:20,328 --> 00:43:22,637
What do you want me to do?
- No, this is good.

435
00:43:23,088 --> 00:43:26,285
What did you do that for?
I didn't bite him!

436
00:43:27,088 --> 00:43:30,444
Mom! - You didn't have to hit me,
did you? Is my nose bleeding?

437
00:43:31,528 --> 00:43:32,756
Grace, please don't.

438
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:35,881
Why aren't you looking, Mom?

439
00:43:36,328 --> 00:43:38,000
I'm a failure!

440
00:43:38,728 --> 00:43:42,277
I won't live this way.
- I've been incorrigible.

441
00:43:42,728 --> 00:43:45,606
Mom, you made me do this.
- Stop this!

442
00:43:46,568 --> 00:43:49,765
Fuck yourself!
- Paul! Shut up! ...cowardly lion.

443
00:43:51,448 --> 00:43:53,006
Grace, I'll never say it again.

444
00:43:53,448 --> 00:43:56,485
Liar!
- No! I promise!

445
00:43:56,928 --> 00:43:58,680
You promise what?
- Never to say "Papua..."

446
00:43:59,128 --> 00:44:01,119
You're so evil, Mother!

447
00:44:24,448 --> 00:44:25,722
It's okay...

448
00:44:27,808 --> 00:44:29,924
I'll fight you standing on one foot,

449
00:44:30,408 --> 00:44:32,126
I'll fight you with my eyes closed!

450
00:44:33,648 --> 00:44:34,797
Elaine!

451
00:44:38,288 --> 00:44:41,325
You know when you're
just about to go to sleep,

452
00:44:41,768 --> 00:44:45,124
or you're just sort of,
you know, falling asleep...

453
00:44:45,568 --> 00:44:49,083
and you think you're really falling,
so you catch yourself?

454
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:54,963
That ever happen to you? You're
not falling, just falling asleep.

455
00:44:55,408 --> 00:44:56,523
There you go.

456
00:44:58,888 --> 00:45:01,322
When I was a little girl,

457
00:45:02,328 --> 00:45:04,523
I always wanted to fly.

458
00:45:05,768 --> 00:45:07,121
From the top of the house.

459
00:45:09,048 --> 00:45:11,039
At night, I'd close my eyes,

460
00:45:11,808 --> 00:45:14,641
and imagine I was on the roof,

461
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:18,319
looking down at my parents
in their bed.

462
00:45:19,488 --> 00:45:21,319
And then I'd jump off...

463
00:45:22,608 --> 00:45:24,326
and I'd fly...

464
00:45:26,848 --> 00:45:29,282
While everyone was sleeping,

465
00:45:30,088 --> 00:45:33,160
I'd be soaring around,

466
00:45:37,048 --> 00:45:39,323
looking through their windows,

467
00:45:40,768 --> 00:45:42,121
flying...

468
00:45:45,928 --> 00:45:48,317
and resting in the trees.

469
00:45:50,888 --> 00:45:53,197
I always knew I could,

470
00:45:54,488 --> 00:45:56,763
but I never told them.

471
00:45:58,368 --> 00:46:02,520
Once someone knows,
they can make you fall.

472
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:14,481
After I'm big,
I may start acting weird,

473
00:46:14,928 --> 00:46:17,681
stop returning calls,
dressing all in black,

474
00:46:18,128 --> 00:46:20,005
fancy restaurants, the whole shtick.

475
00:46:20,448 --> 00:46:22,404
I want you to keep me in perspective.

476
00:46:22,848 --> 00:46:26,761
Paul, you already wear black.
- You know what I mean.

477
00:46:27,448 --> 00:46:30,167
I just can't
become a slave to my success.

478
00:46:30,608 --> 00:46:34,601
I have to stay myself.
- I think she likes me.

479
00:46:35,088 --> 00:46:38,364
Did you see how she looked in my eyes?
- The great Paul Leger!

480
00:46:38,808 --> 00:46:41,766
I started thinking
about Paul's garbage theory, about

481
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:45,006
male organs making extra proteins
when a beautiful woman looks at you.

482
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,522
And if she keeps on looking,
they produce

483
00:46:48,968 --> 00:46:53,405
an extra protein, so deadly
that one drop on the tip of an arrow

484
00:46:53,848 --> 00:46:57,045
could kill
a fucking rhino in 2 seconds.

485
00:46:58,088 --> 00:47:00,886
I started to think
what I wanted her to think,

486
00:47:01,648 --> 00:47:03,400
I looked in her eyes,

487
00:47:04,448 --> 00:47:05,597
and bingo!

488
00:47:09,888 --> 00:47:11,765
She was mine.

489
00:47:13,128 --> 00:47:15,881
Paul swears that
cavemen used this deadly technique,

490
00:47:16,328 --> 00:47:20,321
and that the deadly male protein
killed the dinosaurs, not the ice age.

491
00:47:20,768 --> 00:47:23,999
I think he saw it in a movie,
and convinced himself it was true.

492
00:47:24,448 --> 00:47:26,518
That's how Paul escaped.

493
00:47:26,968 --> 00:47:29,766
And that's just what he did
the next day.

494
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:32,597
I never paid much attention
to Paul's garbage theories.

495
00:47:33,048 --> 00:47:35,323
But then I realized he was right.

496
00:47:35,768 --> 00:47:39,966
I felt the proteins running through
my body like broken glass.

497
00:47:40,408 --> 00:47:44,640
I tried to keep the proteins busy
by making flying machines.

498
00:47:45,088 --> 00:47:48,000
I've never built
a flying machine before.

499
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:51,485
The proteins
were making things fly in my head.

500
00:47:51,928 --> 00:47:55,523
The more I worked on it,
the more I was sure it would fly.

501
00:47:55,968 --> 00:47:59,722
I just kept telling myself:
It's gonna fly.

502
00:48:01,608 --> 00:48:04,168
Love hit me like an elephant,

503
00:48:04,608 --> 00:48:07,725
and I was thrown
into a jungle of dreams.

504
00:48:08,168 --> 00:48:11,922
Mother was wrong about magnetic pulls.
There was only one pull,

505
00:48:12,368 --> 00:48:14,165
and she was lying on my back.

506
00:48:15,128 --> 00:48:18,757
I wasn't "falling in love,"
because I never felt any weight,

507
00:48:19,368 --> 00:48:23,156
because I was "flying in love,"
for the first time in my life.

508
00:49:17,848 --> 00:49:20,237
Beautiful morning out, isn't it?

509
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,561
Yes, it is.

510
00:49:25,768 --> 00:49:27,838
Sit down. I'll do this.

511
00:49:32,328 --> 00:49:34,478
Cereal? - Huh?
- Cereal?

512
00:49:35,528 --> 00:49:36,847
Sure.

513
00:49:47,648 --> 00:49:51,163
I made some coffee for you.
- Great, thanks.

514
00:49:51,608 --> 00:49:53,917
Did you fuck her?

515
00:49:54,368 --> 00:49:56,245
What?

516
00:49:59,128 --> 00:50:00,846
My mother. Did you fuck her?

517
00:50:03,128 --> 00:50:04,083
No.

518
00:50:13,848 --> 00:50:17,761
You liar! I can smell her on you.

519
00:50:22,528 --> 00:50:25,486
You're not the first,
did you know that?

520
00:50:30,608 --> 00:50:32,564
Could I have some milk?

521
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:43,162
She's had a lot of young ones
like you, eats you up like chocolates.

522
00:50:43,608 --> 00:50:47,920
Could I have a spoon?
- When she finishes a whole box,

523
00:50:52,408 --> 00:50:56,560
she sticks her finger
down her throat, and it comes back up.

524
00:50:59,648 --> 00:51:04,199
You must have done well in school.
- Straight A's.

525
00:51:54,688 --> 00:51:57,122
Food!
- Good!

526
00:51:58,328 --> 00:52:00,398
Food! Hungry!

527
00:52:00,848 --> 00:52:03,442
I'm kind of hungry.
- Hungry!

528
00:52:06,688 --> 00:52:10,237
Very good.
- Good... Thirsty? Yes.

529
00:52:59,568 --> 00:53:02,844
Two... one... go!

530
00:53:23,008 --> 00:53:24,282
Almost!

531
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:35,321
You ever thought about leaving?
- Only a million times.

532
00:53:36,768 --> 00:53:40,556
Why don't you?
- Soon I'm going to Papua New Guinea.

533
00:53:43,048 --> 00:53:46,927
Ever thought about Alaska?
- Why would I go there?

534
00:53:47,368 --> 00:53:49,836
It's very beautiful.

535
00:53:50,288 --> 00:53:55,567
In my dream, y'know, the movie dream?
There was a place on the Bering Sea.

536
00:53:56,008 --> 00:53:59,205
It's completely flat, and really,
really quiet, y'know?

537
00:54:00,168 --> 00:54:04,241
Not even the wind whistling,
because there's nothing there.

538
00:54:04,688 --> 00:54:06,644
And then there's a boat,

539
00:54:07,768 --> 00:54:09,326
and then...

540
00:54:10,928 --> 00:54:13,647
there's the Eskimos.
- The Eskimos!

541
00:54:14,088 --> 00:54:19,560
The Eskimos push their old people out
on ice floes to die! - No!

542
00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:24,001
They don't do that! Elaine, I was
trying to tell you the other night.

543
00:54:24,448 --> 00:54:28,157
Eskimos believe that,
even though you die,

544
00:54:28,608 --> 00:54:30,326
you're never really

545
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,167
dead.

546
00:54:33,048 --> 00:54:34,083
What then?

547
00:54:36,488 --> 00:54:38,160
You're... infinity.

548
00:54:39,168 --> 00:54:42,717
They believe that when
the physical suit of skin dies,

549
00:54:43,168 --> 00:54:46,638
it becomes part of the earth,
but your soul...

550
00:54:47,088 --> 00:54:49,886
keeps going, into other things...

551
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,967
like trees...

552
00:54:53,408 --> 00:54:56,002
or fish or rocks...

553
00:54:56,448 --> 00:55:00,327
or even other people, who actually
are at that point, you.

554
00:55:01,368 --> 00:55:03,245
And if you don't like what you became?

555
00:55:08,688 --> 00:55:09,643
Shit!

556
00:55:10,888 --> 00:55:13,721
You wait a few years,
and then you turn into something else.

557
00:55:14,168 --> 00:55:17,365
And love works the same way...

558
00:55:17,808 --> 00:55:21,801
So like, if you and I
went down in a plane crash,

559
00:55:22,248 --> 00:55:26,161
that would be okay,
because our souls would keep going.

560
00:55:27,168 --> 00:55:30,285
And we'd love each other
over and over, from place to place,

561
00:55:31,808 --> 00:55:33,480
because it's infinity.

562
00:55:34,528 --> 00:55:38,237
And you want to go there with me?
- Yeah.

563
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:44,759
We would love each other
over and over, for infinity.

564
00:55:45,808 --> 00:55:46,763
Elaine,

565
00:55:47,688 --> 00:55:53,285
we'll go to the Bering Sea,
we'll be in love, and we'll never die.

566
00:55:53,728 --> 00:55:57,846
Never die. We can leave tomorrow,
or we can leave right now.

567
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,321
Okay.

568
00:56:22,408 --> 00:56:26,879
I hope we're not disturbing.
- What are you doing here, Leo?

569
00:56:27,328 --> 00:56:30,047
Axel, is that how you say hello?
- Just hold it.

570
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:33,605
Mrs. Stalker, nice seeing you again.
Axel, get your things,

571
00:56:34,048 --> 00:56:37,757
and we can get going.
- I'm not going anywhere, Leo.

572
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:41,798
I bet you're gonna come.
- Paul, hold it. - Alright.

573
00:56:42,248 --> 00:56:47,766
Mrs. Stalker, if we could
just be privately for a moment?

574
00:56:58,168 --> 00:56:59,123
Yes.

575
00:57:05,048 --> 00:57:10,247
So you're working on the old airplane?
- Don't touch it! - I'm sorry.

576
00:57:13,808 --> 00:57:16,322
It's great! Great.

577
00:57:16,768 --> 00:57:21,717
You should be with your sick uncle,
instead of playing with this nutcase.

578
00:57:22,168 --> 00:57:25,160
You know, this whole airplane...
- What did you say?

579
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:29,078
You know what this is for her?
This is like a prescription.

580
00:57:29,528 --> 00:57:33,999
The name you called her!
- Oh, I called her a name? - Yes.

581
00:57:34,448 --> 00:57:39,124
What did I call her? Can't remember.
I think I called her... psycho!

582
00:57:39,568 --> 00:57:42,321
Psychopath!
When are you gonna get it, Axel?

583
00:57:48,488 --> 00:57:52,117
Nothing like freshly brewed coffee.
- It's instant.

584
00:57:54,048 --> 00:57:56,357
I knew that, Mrs. Stalker.

585
00:57:56,808 --> 00:58:01,006
I don't like conflict. - No one said
you did, Mr. Smilie. - Sweetie.

586
00:58:01,448 --> 00:58:04,520
I know no one said that I did.

587
00:58:05,808 --> 00:58:10,086
But we should get down to business.
- We don't have any, Mr. Smilie.

588
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,564
Sweetie. Try that.

589
00:58:14,808 --> 00:58:19,279
Very nice. We do have business.
I want him returned to me.

590
00:58:20,848 --> 00:58:23,885
He's a man, not an object,
Mr. Smi... Sweetie.

591
00:58:24,328 --> 00:58:26,523
A stranger doesn't tell
a father what a son is.

592
00:58:27,608 --> 00:58:30,486
You'll find
it's not me who's the stranger.

593
00:58:32,768 --> 00:58:35,566
Mrs. Stalker, let me put it this way:

594
00:58:36,008 --> 00:58:38,761
You see that '65 Coup de Ville?
- It's a '66, not a '65.

595
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:43,247
I beg your pardon, it's a '65,
and although it's very nice,

596
00:58:43,688 --> 00:58:48,239
it needs suspension work in the front.
- The suspension is perfect.

597
00:58:48,688 --> 00:58:50,758
Fine. Then it needs a new alignment.

598
00:58:51,568 --> 00:58:56,562
Did you come here to give automotive
advice? - Though an older model,

599
00:58:57,008 --> 00:58:59,681
it still has style.
- Sugar? - I never use it.

600
00:59:01,168 --> 00:59:03,363
Now imagine if you will,

601
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:09,279
a brand new Coup de Ville,
fresh from the factory,

602
00:59:09,728 --> 00:59:12,481
sitting alongside your '65.

603
00:59:12,928 --> 00:59:15,283
The beautiful lines of the older model

604
00:59:15,728 --> 00:59:19,562
lose their elegance. The body sags,
the finish is dull. You wash it,

605
00:59:20,008 --> 00:59:25,207
wax it, but it's still lifeless.
- Mr. Smilie...

606
00:59:26,048 --> 00:59:29,836
There isn't a thing you can do
to make it new again!

607
00:59:30,288 --> 00:59:33,644
Those two automobiles do not
belong together. Am I clear?

608
00:59:34,088 --> 00:59:37,842
No, the only thing that's clear,
Mr. Smilie... - No! Sweetie!

609
00:59:38,288 --> 00:59:43,237
...is that your attempt to insult me
with car metaphors is incredibly

610
00:59:43,688 --> 00:59:47,317
immature! - Immature! Right!
You could be his mother!

611
00:59:47,768 --> 00:59:51,522
But I'm not,
Mr. Sweetie, I'm his lover.

612
00:59:53,968 --> 00:59:56,198
And I must tell you, your nephew

613
00:59:56,648 --> 01:00:00,163
is a wild animal in bed.
Perhaps you might ask him for lessons.

614
01:00:00,808 --> 01:00:06,121
I had hoped his sexual awakening
would've been with someone who

615
01:00:06,568 --> 01:00:09,241
knew the difference
between making love and fucking!

616
01:00:18,168 --> 01:00:22,081
Come on! Coffee break is over,
fellows. Back to work!

617
01:00:22,528 --> 01:00:27,477
Come on, Paul! Axel! Come on!
- No! I'm not going!

618
01:00:27,928 --> 01:00:31,637
Paul, grab the other arm!
I'm gonna kick the shit out of you,

619
01:00:32,088 --> 01:00:33,316
little son-of-a-bitch!

620
01:00:34,848 --> 01:00:38,397
Come on, Axel! - You don't realize
how angry... - Just come along!

621
01:00:38,848 --> 01:00:41,521
I'm really mad!
- Hands off him, Mr. Smilie!

622
01:00:45,328 --> 01:00:48,525
Elaine, you can't shoot me,
I have this performance on Friday.

623
01:00:48,968 --> 01:00:51,482
It's an audition.

624
01:00:51,928 --> 01:00:54,886
It's not a performance.
It's an audition.

625
01:00:56,728 --> 01:00:58,923
This is ridiculous.

626
01:00:59,368 --> 01:01:00,847
I mean...

627
01:01:01,888 --> 01:01:05,961
I mean, Mrs. Stalker,
we've said a lot of things, and some

628
01:01:06,408 --> 01:01:08,763
were half kidding...
Why don't you put down the gun?

629
01:01:10,408 --> 01:01:14,242
That I understand.
That makes sense.

630
01:01:14,688 --> 01:01:17,521
No more of that.

631
01:01:17,968 --> 01:01:20,687
Axel, don't forget, Friday at 8:30!

632
01:01:21,528 --> 01:01:25,567
Yes, get in the car! Go back

633
01:01:26,008 --> 01:01:27,964
to where you should be!

634
01:01:33,888 --> 01:01:37,563
I knew if Paul saw me,
he'd never understand

635
01:01:38,008 --> 01:01:42,206
that going to Papua New Guinea wasn't
the answer. Flying was the secret.

636
01:01:42,648 --> 01:01:47,358
Columbus wouldn't think I was crazy
for building a flying machine,

637
01:01:47,808 --> 01:01:52,518
because history is all dreams.
No rules or books. It's just there,

638
01:01:52,968 --> 01:01:57,598
waiting to be discovered
like when Columbus found this place.

639
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:00,687
I don't know if he found his dream.

640
01:02:01,128 --> 01:02:02,083
Fuck with me, now!

641
01:02:02,528 --> 01:02:07,727
Because in the middle of a storm,
you can't turn back, like Elaine.

642
01:02:08,168 --> 01:02:11,001
She could only sail straight ahead.

643
01:02:11,448 --> 01:02:14,997
If she asked me to build a rocket,
and take her to another galaxy,

644
01:02:15,448 --> 01:02:17,279
I'd build a rocket.

645
01:03:53,368 --> 01:03:55,563
Very nice! Good.

646
01:03:56,688 --> 01:04:00,044
Excellent! You finished now?
- No! - No?

647
01:04:00,488 --> 01:04:02,604
No!
- You just finish.

648
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:05,198
To remember my dreams,

649
01:04:05,648 --> 01:04:08,958
I turn them into stories.
But dreams are like life.

650
01:04:09,408 --> 01:04:13,526
You can't catch them in your hands,
because you can't really see them.

651
01:04:13,968 --> 01:04:18,723
If you believe in your dreams,
no tornado, volcano or typhoon

652
01:04:19,168 --> 01:04:24,242
can knock you "out of love,"
because love exists on its own.

653
01:04:24,688 --> 01:04:27,646
Listen to me,
if you ever touch this machine again,

654
01:04:28,088 --> 01:04:30,124
I'm going to kill you!

655
01:04:31,008 --> 01:04:34,523
Being caught in the dream of two
women is the craziest storm of all.

656
01:04:34,968 --> 01:04:38,927
The battle isn't good and evil,
but between weaker and stronger.

657
01:04:39,528 --> 01:04:43,441
The weaker is desperate for air.
At this moment, my feet were

658
01:04:43,888 --> 01:04:46,118
planted in the ground like a tree,

659
01:04:46,568 --> 01:04:49,560
and if you moved to one side,
you become the storm.

660
01:04:50,008 --> 01:04:54,559
Even though I was ready to kill Grace,
I wasn't sure which side I'd move to.

661
01:04:55,008 --> 01:04:58,000
So I tried to anchor myself
until the storm passed.

662
01:05:25,848 --> 01:05:27,281
Disgusting!

663
01:06:45,608 --> 01:06:46,723
Turn around!
