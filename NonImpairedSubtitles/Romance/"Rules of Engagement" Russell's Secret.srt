1
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:07,299
Remember on your birthday how
you asked me for something special?

2
00:00:07,816 --> 00:00:10,509
Oh my God!
You're taking me to Cancun!

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,397
Not that birthday.

4
00:00:12,936 --> 00:00:16,018
You bought those diamond earrings from Tiffany's?
- Not... Special.

5
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:20,744
How many birthdays are going back, Jeff?
I'm no longer interested in seeing The Go-Go's.

6
00:00:21,979 --> 00:00:23,647
That was never gonna happen.

7
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:28,335
Whatever it is, I'm sure I will love it
or whatever I exchange it for.

8
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:31,448
You're not gonna want
to exchange this, my friend.

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,658
Fifth row center for a little
Broadway offering called Wicked.

10
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:36,968
You're kidding!

11
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:39,188
I can't believe you remembered.

12
00:00:39,355 --> 00:00:41,166
It's been like four years.

13
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:45,086
It's great. They probably
worked out the kinks by now.

14
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,672
What made you think of this?

15
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:51,705
Well, I was in that neighborhood where there's
theater after theater, all the theaters...

16
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:54,322
What's it called down there?

17
00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:56,473
The theater district?

18
00:00:57,211 --> 00:00:58,704
No, it'll come to me.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,771
Anyway. Looked up,
saw the poster, thought of you.

20
00:01:03,251 --> 00:01:05,856
The poster has two witches on it.

21
00:01:06,445 --> 00:01:08,442
Right, it is the theater district.

22
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:12,030
Thank you, honey, this is very sweet.

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,114
Wait. Jeff, there's only
one ticket in here.

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,914
I am not gonna cause a distraction
while you sneak in the side door.

25
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:25,584
I'm not going.
That's part of your gift.

26
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:28,630
I don't wanna go alone.
- Yes, you do.

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,547
I want you to go with me.
- No, you don't.

28
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,509
It's more fun to share
the experience with someone.

29
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:38,858
Is it? Well, let's examine the last time
we shared the theater going experience.

30
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:42,811
We got to our seats.
- You mimed killing yourself.

31
00:01:43,856 --> 00:01:46,690
Curtain went up.
- You mimed killing yourself.

32
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,675
Three town's people on stage started...

33
00:01:50,223 --> 00:01:51,338
to sing.

34
00:01:52,397 --> 00:01:55,155
You mimed killing them and
then turned the gun on yourself.

35
00:01:57,063 --> 00:01:59,929
That was before
the boiler went on the fritz.

36
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:03,622
This is the most thoughtful gift ever!

37
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:32,588
Shut up, Russell.

38
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:35,517
Hey, guys. What's going on?

39
00:02:36,216 --> 00:02:37,823
Well, Russell's making fun of us

40
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,410
because I mentioned that Adam and I
are taking dance lessons for our wedding.

41
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,919
Not you, just Adam or
should I say Mr. Mo Jangles.

42
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,294
There's nothing gay about
taking dance lessons for your wedding.

43
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,669
Yeah, we did.

44
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,781
Oh, did you, Fred Astaire,
at some guy's ass?

45
00:02:59,755 --> 00:03:02,301
What? It's funny when it's not me.

46
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:05,795
Well, we're starting early because

47
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,991
"we" need all the help "we" can get.

48
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:14,069
It's a good thing you're holding your
hand up so I don't get my feelings hurt.

49
00:03:14,898 --> 00:03:15,975
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:16,142 --> 00:03:18,470
It doesn't matter
that you're a bad dancer.

51
00:03:18,637 --> 00:03:21,076
It's just another thing we get to do
together. And I love doing things with you.

52
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,367
Me too.

53
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,601
Don't you mean "Me tutu"?

54
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,721
Ballerina?

55
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,272
Alright, I'm out. Pay for me.

56
00:03:32,577 --> 00:03:35,255
You know, Adam, you don't have
to pretend to love everything she does.

57
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,550
Do you get a commission
every time a couple breaks up?

58
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:42,075
I'm saying there's such a thing
as too much togetherness.

59
00:03:42,242 --> 00:03:43,564
You see the shining?

60
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,281
You're old.

61
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:48,921
I'm wise.

62
00:03:49,088 --> 00:03:51,064
When you've been together
as long as Audrey and I have

63
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,234
it's OK to have seperate interests.
For instance, she loves going to the theater.

64
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:55,902
And I hate it.

65
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:59,113
Hating the theater is not an interest.

66
00:04:00,517 --> 00:04:02,117
An interest is something you enjoy.

67
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:04,304
I enjoy hating the theater.

68
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,872
There's gotta be stuff
you guys like doing together.

69
00:04:09,512 --> 00:04:11,070
There's gotta be.

70
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:14,693
There is. Like the Boat Show.

71
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,866
Which, by the way, is in town this week.
- Again?

72
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:20,024
Didn't we just go to that thing?

73
00:04:20,191 --> 00:04:21,803
A year ago.
- Really?

74
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,682
God, feels like just
yesterday I was thinking

75
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,578
"Boy, glad I don't have to suffer
through this for another year."

76
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:29,957
Come on, you love the Boat Show!

77
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:32,932
No, I tolerate it.
I only do it 'cause you like it.

78
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:37,610
First time I've heard
that outside the bedroom.

79
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:48,746
I hear the new lead is great.
Who was the original girl on this?

80
00:04:49,438 --> 00:04:50,761
Kristin Chenoweth.

81
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:55,138
My husband would not have
known that in a million years.

82
00:04:57,217 --> 00:04:59,048
So, where do you wanna
go get dinner after?

83
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:02,831
One, two, three,

84
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:04,642
back, two, three,

85
00:05:04,809 --> 00:05:06,475
down, two, three,

86
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:08,183
one, two, three.

87
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:10,017
Come on, count.

88
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:14,272
One, two, three and back...
- Not out loud.

89
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:17,442
Can't you think something
without actually saying it?

90
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,294
Yeah, I'm doing it right now.

91
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:22,447
No, no, no.
You see, it's forward, two, three...

92
00:05:22,597 --> 00:05:25,815
He's trying Mr. Vargus.
He just doesn't have any sense of rhythm.

93
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:27,952
You see, he's raised on a comune.**

94
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,935
I don't need a bio, chica.

95
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:32,908
He's not the problem.

96
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:34,571
I'm not?
- He's not?

97
00:05:34,677 --> 00:05:36,350
No, you are.

98
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,634
Tough break, chica.

99
00:05:56,974 --> 00:05:59,317
You got me.** You're so good!

100
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:07,691
You know, the first time I saw this
Kristin blew me away. But this girl, she...

101
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:09,638
might be better.

102
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:12,510
I mean, she really
made Glinda her own.

103
00:06:16,924 --> 00:06:19,184
Oh my God! This isn't a strip club.

104
00:06:19,351 --> 00:06:20,505
I want my money back!

105
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,967
Oh my God!

106
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,010
I thought this was a strip club.
I got all turned around...

107
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,388
I saw you inside.
- No, you didn't.

108
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,974
You were crying.
- No, I wasn't.

109
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,517
And I took a picture.

110
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:35,061
That's good quality.

111
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:37,206
Now delete it. Delete it!

112
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:40,532
Fine.

113
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,820
Fine, I was in there. I like musicals.

114
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,625
Don't tell anyone.

115
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:47,987
That you were here,

116
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:49,442
that you were sobbing,

117
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,976
or that
"she really made Glinda her own"?

118
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,408
What's gonna take to keep you quiet?

119
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,068
What do you got?

120
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,796
I can get you great seats
to any show anytime.

121
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:03,589
Come on, what's your connection?

122
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,698
Well, I may or may not be
the editor of Bernadette Peters' fanzine.

123
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,389
Deal.

124
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:16,100
You do not want to cross me
on this because I swear to you

125
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:18,972
if anyone finds out you will
rue the day that you...

126
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,732
Second act!

127
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,574
That's all you're having?

128
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:31,815
Oh, we have a dance lesson today

129
00:07:31,982 --> 00:07:34,687
and Mr. Vargus doesn't like us
to practice on a full stomach.

130
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:37,550
Screw Mr. Vargus.

131
00:07:39,062 --> 00:07:42,234
Trouble in Danceland?
- Well, it seems that

132
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:46,089
"we're" not as good as
"we" thought we were.

133
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,473
That joke stopped being
funny like four days ago.

134
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,096
Oh, has it been four days?

135
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,702
Because you'd think that

136
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:56,142
"we" be better by now.

137
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,329
Oh, don't get mad, honey.
It's just a dance class.

138
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:02,262
It's like you said.
Something we can do together.

139
00:08:05,406 --> 00:08:07,220
So, you snuck in late last night.

140
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:10,615
Oh, yeah, the show was over 3 hours long.
* after midnight.

141
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,343
Mr. Vargus says it's really
important to get a good night sleep.

142
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,873
Oh my God!

143
00:08:15,722 --> 00:08:18,289
It was so good, Jeff.
You woulda hated it.

144
00:08:19,142 --> 00:08:20,666
See how that works?

145
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,430
She goes to the theater

146
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:26,134
I stay home where I don't have to hear
anyone express themself through song.

147
00:08:28,016 --> 00:08:31,389
Unless of course Adam * love ballad Mr. Vargus.

148
00:08:33,203 --> 00:08:34,261
Jealous!

149
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:38,502
You almost finished here?
I don't want to be late for the Boat Show.

150
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:42,580
First 500 customers get
the commemorative refrigerator magnet.

151
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:46,609
That's today? I have ticket
to the matinee. I'm going to the theatre.

152
00:08:47,118 --> 00:08:49,500
Again? You're turning into a...

153
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:53,032
What do they call people
who go to the theater?

154
00:08:53,657 --> 00:08:54,942
Theater-goers?

155
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,247
You will not believe how often
we have this exact conversation.

156
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,654
You always have fun when we go.

157
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:04,564
We eat Boat Show junk,
use boat lingo,

158
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:06,986
I make a funny seaman pun.

159
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:10,181
I quietly question all my life choices.

160
00:09:11,405 --> 00:09:13,276
I've never been to a Boat Show.

161
00:09:13,443 --> 00:09:14,844
What do you do there?

162
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:19,269
You look at boats.

163
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:22,293
You really didn't see that coming?

164
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,606
How can you skip the Boat Show?
You'll miss all the celebrities.

165
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:28,227
Captain Crunch is not a celebrity.

166
00:09:30,956 --> 00:09:34,169
I'm sorry, what
cereal box is your face on?

167
00:09:36,758 --> 00:09:40,037
Come on, Audrey, you gotta go.
- No, fair is fair, Jeff.

168
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:43,026
You didn't have to go to the theater with me.**
I shouldn't have to go to the Boat Show with you.

169
00:09:43,193 --> 00:09:45,299
Not same thing.
- It's exactly the same thing!

170
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:47,990
Boat Shows are fun.
- Musicals are fun.

171
00:09:48,157 --> 00:09:49,993
They would be if they were Boat Shows!

172
00:09:52,072 --> 00:09:54,927
I can't believe I'm saying this but
let's get to dance class a little early today.

173
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:57,555
Oh good, Mr. Vargus likes punctuality.

174
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,073
Oh my God!

175
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:11,819
Where you been? 3 minutes till curtain.

176
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,405
I'm sorry. I had to blow Jeff off,
it took longer than I expected.

177
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,614
What do ya think,
the guy's not 18 anymore.

178
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:23,149
Blow him off!

179
00:10:23,316 --> 00:10:25,208
As in "not go to the Boat Show with him".

180
00:10:26,264 --> 00:10:27,835
You know, I thought...
- Yeah, I know what you thought.

181
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:36,402
It's a great show, huh?
- Best so far.

182
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,310
Are you on the market
for something today?

183
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,578
No, I'm just looking.

184
00:10:42,731 --> 00:10:44,716
So, does this thing hold a lot of seaman?

185
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,704
Yes, 'cause that's
how you'd say it, sir.

186
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,193
It's a classic.

187
00:10:55,048 --> 00:10:57,562
I know you're at your show.
Call me at intermission.

188
00:10:57,729 --> 00:10:59,867
Something terrific just happened.

189
00:11:01,663 --> 00:11:02,828
Hey, Mike.

190
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:05,831
Hey, man, it's good to see you.
I was hoping you'd be here.

191
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:07,792
Wouldn't miss it.
Gotta check out the new models.

192
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,944
Me too, and in my spare time

193
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:11,587
I look at the boats.

194
00:11:13,326 --> 00:11:14,326
So...

195
00:11:14,837 --> 00:11:16,028
Is Jenny here?

196
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:19,554
No, turns out she never liked it.
She only came because I made her.

197
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,283
Finally, she just said:
"Mike, I'm done."

198
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,017
Yeah, I think Audrey's Boat Show
days are behind her too.

199
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,452
Yeah, well, Jenny wasn't just
talking about the Boat Show.

200
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:30,606
She was talking about the Mike Show.
She's out.

201
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:32,192
Sorry.

202
00:11:32,663 --> 00:11:35,319
Wow, you guys were married awhile.
- 12 years.

203
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:37,363
Same as me and Audrey.

204
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:40,741
Well, then you know
what I'm talking about, right?

205
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,078
You know, you start to grow apart,
you don't like the same things anymore.

206
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:46,185
Including each other.

207
00:11:47,945 --> 00:11:49,558
I don't know why I'm laughing,

208
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:51,032
she took all my stuff.

209
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:56,674
Hey, you know, this is
the first theater I was ever in.

210
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,337
Really? When was that?

211
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:03,389
I must've been seven years old.
- Your parents took you?

212
00:12:03,837 --> 00:12:06,802
No, God no. They were too busy
screaming at each other.

213
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:10,229
I had a nanny named Helga
who was a bigger woman.

214
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,824
Arms like a longshoreman.

215
00:12:12,369 --> 00:12:14,033
She bundled me up

216
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,868
the next thing I know we're here,

217
00:12:16,314 --> 00:12:19,296
in this whole other world where people
are singing, and dancing, and happy

218
00:12:19,463 --> 00:12:20,531
and I just loved it.

219
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:25,426
Yeah, oldest story
in the book though, right?

220
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:30,089
Except for usually I'm telling it once
to be a vita, not bang a vita.**

221
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:33,305
It's pretty lame, right?
- No, not at all.

222
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,525
You have nothing
to be embarassed about.

223
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:38,090
Jeff cried his eyes out
on** "Mr. Holland's Opus".

224
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,717
Really?
- Yes.

225
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,776
There's nothing unmanly
about showing your emotions.

226
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,557
It's actually very atractive
to women when men are sensitive.

227
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:49,773
Maybe you're right.

228
00:12:50,197 --> 00:12:51,391
I once got a happy ending

229
00:12:51,558 --> 00:12:54,545
for pretending to cry
at my grandma's funeral.

230
00:12:55,504 --> 00:12:56,596
Oh, here we go.

231
00:13:02,253 --> 00:13:04,408
She and I just drifted apart,

232
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,887
we navigated into some stormy waters

233
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:09,330
and set sail for different horizons.

234
00:13:09,982 --> 00:13:13,068
Then my accountant started
dropping anchor in her harbor.

235
00:13:14,715 --> 00:13:17,958
Painful but kudos for sticking
with the nautical theme.

236
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,008
Yeah, but... It's better now, you know?

237
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:24,637
I don't have anybody yapping
in my ear about the antique show

238
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,006
or some dumb cooking class.

239
00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:29,102
Although cooking would come in handy.

240
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:32,602
The pizza delivery guy is starting
to make comments, like he's got a life.

241
00:13:34,575 --> 00:13:36,023
So you're doing OK.

242
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,842
Oh man, I'm having a ball.

243
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:41,859
I play golf all I want,
I play video poker till 4 am,

244
00:13:42,026 --> 00:13:43,823
I got a two-day pass for the Boat Show.

245
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,991
Isn't that sweet?
Are you coming tomorrow?

246
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:48,001
How about bowling?
Do you like bowling?

247
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:50,037
I'm pretty much free any night.

248
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,082
Or Atlantic City. I know this great bus.

249
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,293
It doesn't have air conditioning
but you get 10$ in quarters.

250
00:13:56,886 --> 00:13:58,045
Last time I went

251
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,261
the old woman next
to me got heat stroke

252
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:01,966
and I got her quarters.

253
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:05,386
I can't promise that that
will happen when you and I...

254
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,680
Phone call.
- I didn't even hear it ring.

255
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,005
It's on vibrate.
- But I didn't hear it go...

256
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:16,592
Which is...
- Hello?

257
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,760
Emergency?

258
00:14:19,262 --> 00:14:20,067
I'll be right there.

259
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:23,070
I gotta go, there's an emergency.

260
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:25,552
What kind of emergency?
- Very bad.

261
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:28,159
A lot of blood. Real horror show.

262
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,055
Can I come with?
- Just stay in the boat, Michael.

263
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:40,254
That was our best show so far.

264
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,961
I know. I'm gonna have to totally
rethink my Tony predictions.

265
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,469
Should we go get some coffee?

266
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:48,618
Yeah, let me hit the restroom.

267
00:14:48,785 --> 00:14:50,514
Damn * there are no intermissions.

268
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:55,019
Great, you're here.

269
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:56,729
Jeff, what are you doing here?
Is everything OK?

270
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:57,855
It's fine.

271
00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:01,022
What's going on?
- I just thought I'd take you to dinner,

272
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:03,777
and you could tell me about
the singing and dancing you saw and

273
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,097
you know, what makes them do all that.

274
00:15:08,802 --> 00:15:10,659
Why aren't you at the Boat Show?

275
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:13,078
Truth is, it wasn't that
much fun without you.

276
00:15:14,316 --> 00:15:15,247
Really?

277
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:16,951
That's so sweet.

278
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:21,003
Plus I realized that if you do
too many things seperately

279
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,281
you could wind up on
a bus to Atlantic City

280
00:15:23,448 --> 00:15:25,716
stealing quarters off
an old lady with heat stroke.

281
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:29,220
That makes no sense.

282
00:15:29,981 --> 00:15:30,981
See...

283
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:34,091
The bus isn't air conditioned.

284
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,533
So if you weren't having a good time

285
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,979
why did I get a message
that said "something terrific happened"?

286
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,955
That was early on.

287
00:15:41,122 --> 00:15:43,359
I scored big with a seaman pun.

288
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:47,896
Anyway, from now on I think
that we should make an effort

289
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:50,533
to like the things
the other person likes.

290
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,526
And who knows?

291
00:15:53,693 --> 00:15:56,205
Maybe we can find
something we like doing together.

292
00:15:57,104 --> 00:15:58,666
I can think of one or two things.

293
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:00,815
Two? What's the other one?

294
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,380
Hey, Audrey, I got us t-shirts.
All they had was extra large.

295
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,015
That could make it work.**

296
00:16:07,631 --> 00:16:09,486
This isn't a strip club!

297
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:12,348
What's going on here?
- Russell, stop.

298
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,304
You knew he was...
Did you guys come together?

299
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:21,188
The truth is,

300
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,567
I'm nailing your wife.

301
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,402
Don't get mad.

302
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,230
Here's the deal.

303
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:32,264
Russell and I have been coming
to the theater all week together

304
00:16:32,431 --> 00:16:34,493
and it's been really
wonderful sharing that with him.

305
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,036
Him?
- Yes.

306
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:38,879
He has this whole other side

307
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:40,648
that is cultured and kind

308
00:16:41,185 --> 00:16:42,293
and sensitive.

309
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,253
But he won't show it to you 'cause

310
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,994
he's afraid you'll make fun of him.
- Thank you, I'm a dead man.

311
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,184
No, you are not.

312
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:52,261
Jeff, please tell him
you're not gonna tease him.

313
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,681
I'd only do that so he might
see it coming a little bit less.

314
00:16:58,482 --> 00:17:00,390
Russell's a theater queen.

315
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,521
I may have to quit my job

316
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,857
to focus on this full-time.

317
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:07,751
You might wanna take a break

318
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:10,696
so you can pop in Mr. Holland's Opus

319
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:13,422
and cry like Betsy Wetsy.

320
00:17:14,557 --> 00:17:17,315
I only told him to show...
- Just like a woman.

321
00:17:17,482 --> 00:17:19,898
Can't keep anything
from her girlfriends.

322
00:17:21,632 --> 00:17:24,494
Poor Mr. Holland. Had to give up
his dreams and teach highschool.

323
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,505
Changed those kids' lives.
Gave'em the gift of music.

324
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:32,301
So did professor Harold Hill in
The Music Man. He changed the whole town.

325
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,721
Prancing around and singing
a bunch of stuff he could've just said?

326
00:17:36,632 --> 00:17:38,358
Robert Preston did not pranc.

327
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,935
He marched proudly
as he led the big parade.

328
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,562
Not that I know
what kind of parade that was.**

329
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:49,252
Mr. Holland, I gave up all my dreams.

330
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:52,183
Good.

331
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,244
Excellent.

332
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,256
What?

333
00:18:00,423 --> 00:18:03,287
It's just a stupid dance.
What is it that I'm doing so wrong?

334
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,715
She had like 80 fries at lunch today.

335
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:11,035
All right, let's try it again.

336
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,135
You just watch.

337
00:18:22,991 --> 00:18:25,999
I need another hankie,
I'm Mr. Holland's doofus. **

338
00:18:26,512 --> 00:18:29,260
I'd like one
on the aisle for Oklahoma.

339
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:30,943
Shut up!

340
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,714
You guys have been doing
this for like 11 blocks.

341
00:18:34,134 --> 00:18:35,955
You know,
for one brief, shining moment

342
00:18:36,122 --> 00:18:38,659
I had theater buddy Russell
and sweet husband Jeff.

343
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,244
And just like
that it's back to:

344
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,611
"You have feelings."
"You like things."

345
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:44,114
"You're gay."
"No, you're gay."

346
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:45,332
What, are you guys 8?

347
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:49,400
He is.
- You are.

348
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,342
Shut up!

349
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:54,133
Why are all man friendships
based on insulting each other?

350
00:18:54,563 --> 00:18:55,843
I think it's very sad

351
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,037
that you go through life just looking
for ways to cut each other down.

352
00:19:02,056 --> 00:19:03,452
Maybe she's right.

353
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:06,045
We do waste a lot of time * each other.

354
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:08,472
It wouldn't kill us
to grow up a little.

355
00:19:08,854 --> 00:19:09,854
I guess not.

356
00:19:15,443 --> 00:19:16,321
That's Adam.

357
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,283
Dancing with a dude.

358
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:23,016
No way!

359
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:27,041
This is too good.
- Let's get him.

360
00:19:44,207 --> 00:19:46,522
Very impressive choice
for your comeback.

361
00:19:46,689 --> 00:19:48,100
This musical is
3 and a half hours long.

362
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:50,681
Just more time
I get to spend with the woman I love.

363
00:19:53,386 --> 00:19:55,736
Holy smokes. What are the odds.

364
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:57,196
Are you a single?

365
00:19:57,811 --> 00:20:00,532
I'm third row center.
Can we swap so I can sit next to my friend?

366
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,855
Sure.

367
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:03,255
Thank you.

368
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:06,477
This is great!

369
00:20:08,113 --> 00:20:10,542
Wow, pretty lady.
So you guys are still together?

370
00:20:13,056 --> 00:20:15,172
You wanna grab a bite after?
It's on me.

371
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,635
I cleaned up in Atlantic City.

372
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:23,601
Is your weekend booked?
Because we have got a sweet fussball table

373
00:20:23,768 --> 00:20:25,265
at the rec room at my complex.

374
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,769
The teenagers usually hog it
but sometimes you get lucky.

375
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,396
If not we can hit the jacooze

376
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:33,032
get our soak on.

377
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,651
You're not supposed
to go in naked but I probably will.

378
00:20:36,564 --> 00:20:38,779
I don't like * urine on my shorts.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
