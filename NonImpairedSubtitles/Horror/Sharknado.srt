00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:34,893
My associates and I are willing
to negotiate, a reasonable price.

10
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,428
Let's say, 100,000.

Not a penny less.

14
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:52,961
A steep price for a small catch.

A pod of 20,000 sharks are
migrating in this direction.

When we're through with it,

17
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:05,457
One million will look like a bargain.

18

500.

19
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,806
If you're looking to negotiate, Mr.
Palmer, look for the insurance salesman.

You know the most important
thing I learned out here?

30

We shouldn't be afraid of the sharks.

31
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,986

Hey, do you think you can make
this work?

809
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:24,990
Yeah. I'll make it work.

810
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:25,824
Good.

811
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:26,875
Bombs.

812
01:02:26,942 --> 01:02:33,465
Bombs?

813
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:37,385
Instead of letting live sharks rain down on
people, we are going to get in that chopper

814
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:41,173
and throw bombs into the tornadoes.
Blasting those bastards to bits.

815
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,012
I like it, but how is that gonna
stop a tornado?

816
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:50,265
Tornadoes happen when cold and
warm air meet.

817
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:56,738
Now if you drop a bomb head, right in the
middle of it, You might just equalize it.

818
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:02,444
But if you miss, we're screwed.

819
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:06,615
Oh, hell no. You got a death
wish? No way!

820
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:08,700
Dad, I'm the only one that could do it.

821
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,985

822

What's wrong?

823
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:16,508
Your son wants to go into a helicopter
and drop a bomb into the tornado.

824
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:18,293
No! It's too dangerous.

825
01:03:18,344 --> 01:03:20,212
I'll watch his back. I'll be his
bombardier.

826
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,713
Then definitely not.

827
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,683
Dad, we have a chance to save
thousands of lives. Maybe more.

828
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:27,686
You always taught me to help
others. I'm going.

829
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:31,072
He's right April. We'll work it out together.
I won't let anything happen to him.

830
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,274
Don't you understand you can die Matt?

831
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:33,341
Mom, we don't have any other option.

832
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:35,277
And you are not gonna stop me.

838

Now?

Look, what are you and mom doing?

843
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:15,817
You guys can barely stand to be in a
room together for 5 minutes, and now

844
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:20,071
What? Cause you are saving Matt
you're best friends again?

845
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:21,606
He is my son.

846
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,525
I'm your daughter.

847
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:27,362
You guys are always there for him
and you're never there for me.

Hey get that one. No no the
other one.

849

You don't think I try?

850
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:39,207
Not hard enough.

851
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:44,913
I came for you first.

852
01:04:48,768 --> 01:04:49,751
Try to remember that.

01:04:52,605 --> 01:04:54,189
Come on. Come on.

Hey.

855
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,614
I fell off a slide when I was 2.

856
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:21,883
It hurt like hell.

857

Now people think it's cool.

No body thinks this is cool.

What happened?

860
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:33,979
I had a tattoo removed.

01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:41,135
I don't like to talk about it.

[Sigh]

863
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,999
I was raised by my grandparents.

864
01:05:55,835 --> 01:06:00,839
We I was 7 my grandpa took me fishing with
one of those day charter deals with his friends.

865
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:06,761
We end up hitting into a reef
and the boat went down.

866
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:13,852
My grandfather took me and put me
inside this little life- raft for safety.

867
01:06:15,187 --> 01:06:20,809
Everyone else was kinda swimming around
trying to stay up and suddenly all these

868
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,979
sharks just started swarming and-

869
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,649
and then they...

870
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:29,951
tried to protect me but...

871
01:06:32,187 --> 01:06:33,822
By morning they were all gone.

872
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:40,361
So I floated out there for 2 days
until one of those coast guard

873
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,747
helicopters finally spotted me.

874
01:06:44,383 --> 01:06:51,056
I thought I was safe but suddenly
this shark leaped up and bit my leg.

875
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:56,811
6 people went into the water and
one little girl came out.

876
01:06:58,597 --> 01:06:59,981
The sharks took the rest.

877
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:06,187
They took my grandfather.

878
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:09,274
So I really hate sharks.

879
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:14,079

drives this in into the storm.
