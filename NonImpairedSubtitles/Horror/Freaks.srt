1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,094
We didn't lie to you, folks.

3
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,014
We told you we had living,

4
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,933
breathing, monstrosities.

5
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,687
You'll laugh at them,
shudder at them..

6
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,441
and yet. But for the accident of birth..

7
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,360
you might be even as they are.

8
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,823
They did not ask to
be brought into the world...

9
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,868
but into the world they came.

10
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,621
Their code is a law unto themselves.

11
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,792
Offend one..

12
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,878
and you offend them all.

13
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,802
And now folks,
if you'll just step this way...

14
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:43,973
you are about to witness the most amazing,

15
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,352
the most astounding,
living monstrosity..

16
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,396
of all time.

17
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:58,154
Friends...

18
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:02,492
she was once a beautiful woman.

19
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,661
A royal prince shot himself...

20
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,498
for love of her.

21
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,335
She was known as the peacock of the air...

22
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:27,350
She's the most beautiful
big woman I have ever seen.

23
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,601
Why Hans...

24
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:32,647
How you talk!
I should be jealous pretty soon.

25
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,274
Ah, don't be silly.

26
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,611
Don't be silly? I think this woman's
making eyes...

27
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:40,947
at my Hans.

28
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,908
Of course, I ain't jealous.

29
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,702
Oh, Frieda, my dear...

30
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,664
I have eyes for only one woman...

31
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:55,711
the woman I ask to be my wife.

32
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,934
Are you laughing at me?

33
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,477
Why no, monsieur.

34
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:55,104
Then I'm glad.

35
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,231
Why should I laugh at you?

36
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,317
Most big people do.

37
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:04,322
They don't realize I'm a man
with the same feelings they have.

38
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,704
Thank you.

39
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,625
You are so kind, monsieur.

40
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,635
Nice, nice.

41
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:27,970
Don't, don't.

42
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,281
You must come to see me sometime.

43
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,867
And we'll have a little wine together.

44
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,620
Thank you.

45
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,596
...only your imagination.

46
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,722
But Monsieur Dubois..

47
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,767
at first,
I could not believe my own eyes.

48
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:20,022
A lot of horrible, twisted things,
crawling, whining, globbering.

49
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:22,358
Really, Jon, what were you
drinking last night?

50
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,610
Nothing, monsieur, I assure you.

51
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:36,288
Oh, monsieur, there must be
a law in France to smother such things at birth...

52
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:39,208
- Or lock them up
- All right, Jon...

53
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,545
if there's anything like you say
on my grounds we'll have it removed.

54
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,860
Go away!
Go away all of you!

55
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:15,911
Don't you know tresspassing's
the same as stealing.

56
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:21,083
Oh, I'm sorry, monsieur.
I am Madame Tetrallini.

57
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,628
These are children of my circus.

58
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:25,921
Children! Monsters!

59
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,092
Oh, you're a circus.. I understand.

60
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,011
So you see, monsieur...

61
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,512
when I have a chance...

62
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:36,682
I like to
take them into the sunshine...

63
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:39,518
and let them play like...children.

64
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:43,856
That is what most of them are...

65
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,525
children

66
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:50,779
Children...children.

67
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:58,454
Please forget the mistake, madame.

68
00:08:58,662 --> 00:09:00,748
You are welcome to remain.
Au revoir.

69
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,583
Come, Jon.

70
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,461
Thanks a thousand, monsieur.

71
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:12,259
Oh, shame, shame, shame.

72
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,469
How many times...

73
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,013
have I told you
not to be frightened.

74
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,973
Have I not told you

75
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:22,102
God looks after all his children?

76
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:34,490
Good evening Madam Tetralini.

77
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,868
How are you Madam Tetralini?
Big crowd tonight...

78
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,625
There she goes taking them off to exercise.

79
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,921
Nurse to a lot of mangy freaks.

80
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,466
Just as they are
represented on the banners..

81
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,551
you will meet them on the
inside!

82
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,804
living, breathing monstrosities!:

83
00:09:57,262 --> 00:10:00,849
Joséphine-Joseph
half woman, half man.!

84
00:10:01,725 --> 00:10:03,268
Have a cigar, Joseph?

85
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,395
You dropped your lipstick, Josephine.

86
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:08,482
Don't get her sore or
he'll punch you in the nose.

87
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,861
Come on! Hurry up!

88
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,040
You're all wrong.
I didn't d-d-do it.

89
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:27,209
What are you trying to do, be funny?

90
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,003
Ah, you just d-don't understand.

91
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:34,591
A Roman lady getting
off the bull...

92
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,260
and scratching yourself!

93
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:39,012
Well, c-can't a
Roman lady itch?

94
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,473
Why don't you take a bath.

95
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,393
I did, but it's the bull
that needs the b-b-bath.

96
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,448
I think she likes you...

97
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,494
...but he d-don't.

98
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:18,176
Oh Hans, those flowers you
sent to me...they were beautiful!

99
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:20,512
But none as beautiful as you.

100
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,808
Thank you.

101
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,855
And Hans...
I don't like to ask...

102
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:33,900
but may I have the loan of
another thousand franks...

103
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:36,361
until my money
from Paris arrives?

104
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:38,780
With pleasure, fraeulein.

105
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,907
Thank you.

106
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,036
I'll bring it to your wagon tonight.

107
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,250
Oh forget it, forget it.

108
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,835
Maybe I was just fooling.

109
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,379
Fooling? Fooling, huh?

110
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,424
"Come little girl, I want to take
care of you."

111
00:11:58,425 --> 00:12:00,135
Oh, and I fell for that!

112
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,436
Ah forget it, forget it.

113
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:22,407
So you're quitting?
Is that it?

114
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,827
Maybe I'm only fooling.

115
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:27,996
Well you're not quitting me...

116
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:31,124
'cause I'm kicking you out!

117
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,338
Oh no you don't. I gave you this.

118
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,050
Why you cheap...! Oh!

119
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:43,678
And don't you come
around crying tonight...

120
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:45,764
trying to get back in.

121
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,058
I'm through wasting my time
and money...

122
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,310
on dames like you.

123
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,064
Yeah, you're time, but my money!

124
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:58,151
Ungrateful little tramp.

125
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,207
Well, what are you staring at?

126
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:17,295
Didn't you ever see a lady move before?

127
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,715
I guess you been listening to
every word he said.

128
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:25,470
That's it. That's it,
go ahead and laugh.

129
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,222
It's funny ain't it.

130
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:30,433
Women are funny, ain't they.

131
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,854
They're all tramps, ain't they.

132
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:37,107
Yeah. Except when you can
get money from them.

133
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,036
Well, I'll be...

134
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,166
Say, who do you think
you are, shooting off your hat.

135
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,503
Hey, this is Phroso...
Phroso you're talking to!

136
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:04,009
Not any of those lugs you been chasing
around with. Now you listen to me..

137
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:06,344
Oh, I didn't mean you.

138
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:08,722
I had to take it out on somebody.

139
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,767
Yeah, you dames is all alike.
You sharp shoot your cheeks,

140
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:15,103
and how you squeal when
you get what's coming to you.

141
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:20,567
Aw, easy. Take it easy. Cut it!

142
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:25,071
It's my own fault.

143
00:14:26,781 --> 00:14:29,326
What gets me so
cockeyed sore at myself...

144
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,870
is that I fell for
that big bunch of beef.

145
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:33,538
So you finally got
wise to yourself, did you?

146
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:37,959
Funny thing about you women.
Most of you don't get wise soon enough.

147
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:40,670
You wait until you're
so old nobody wants you.

148
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,797
Nobody does most of the time.

149
00:14:42,964 --> 00:14:45,884
Yeah, you ought to be tickled to
death you're washed up with him.

150
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:47,552
You're not so hard to look at.

151
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:50,305
Give yourself a couple.
You'll make the grade.

152
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,015
Your break is coming.

153
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:54,643
Coming! Gone, you mean.

154
00:14:54,684 --> 00:14:57,145
Oh, now your gonna sit there
feeling sorry for yourself.

155
00:14:57,145 --> 00:15:00,065
Oh, no I ain't.
Don't you ever accuse me of that!

156
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:02,275
All right!.. All right!

157
00:15:04,986 --> 00:15:08,698
But one thing..Don't go around filling your
hide with a lot of booze, celebrating...

158
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:11,534
'cause fun what's got that way
never done no one no good.

159
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:14,037
Get me?

160
00:15:15,163 --> 00:15:16,331
I got you...

161
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,172
Say you're a pretty good kid.

162
00:15:24,964 --> 00:15:25,924
You're darn right I am.

163
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:28,426
You should've caught me
before my operation...

164
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,934
- Hello Phroso!
- Hello Phroso!

165
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,521
Tomorrow night's the
big night, hey ladies?

166
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,356
Yes, my sister's getting married.

167
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:44,692
- And I'm thrilled to death.
- She thrills at anything.

168
00:15:45,276 --> 00:15:47,695
Oh, Roscoe's a good kid.

169
00:15:47,695 --> 00:15:49,906
She's only joking. She'll like him
lots...

170
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:51,408
after she knows him better.

171
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:55,745
Oh, that reminds me.
Close your eyes.

172
00:15:56,371 --> 00:15:57,622
Violet.
Go ahead, close them.

173
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:02,001
- What did I do?
- You pinched Daisy's arm.

174
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:05,046
Well, what do you know about that!

175
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,260
Her master's voice is calling...

176
00:16:11,594 --> 00:16:15,432
Getting fresh, ay?
Well, I don't like it one b-b-b...

177
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,100
Well, come on. Come on.

178
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,269
You'll have to hurry.
We haven't much time.

179
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,148
So you were flirting with that
cheap clown, were you?

180
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,984
No, I wasn't.
All he was doing was a trick with me.

181
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:27,444
You shut up.

182
00:16:27,902 --> 00:16:30,947
I'm m-marrying
your sister, n-not you

183
00:16:31,906 --> 00:16:33,533
I saw him getting
familiar with you.

184
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:35,160
Oh come on, Daisy.

185
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,371
Oh no you d-don't.
She's gonna stay right here!

186
00:16:38,496 --> 00:16:40,623
No she isn't! I gotta go.

187
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:44,961
Oh, phooey! You're always
using that for an excu- for an excu...

188
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:47,172
...for an ali-b-b-bi.

189
00:16:58,474 --> 00:17:00,059
Where are you going?

190
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,568
Well, you don't look
around me so much. Do you?

191
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:11,654
Oh yes, I have seen you.

192
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,240
So that's how it is.

193
00:17:15,783 --> 00:17:17,535
You got to be coy. Well?

194
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,387
Ah! Come on in.

195
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,933
Help yourself to a drink.

196
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,810
Ah! That is fine.

197
00:17:46,814 --> 00:17:48,441
Do you like eating something?

198
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,360
Always.

199
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:04,290
How many?

200
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,044
Oh, I'm not very hungry...
about six.

201
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,343
How do you like them?

202
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:21,307
Not bad.

203
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,145
Oh, but you are strong!

204
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,314
You're squeezing me to death.

205
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:29,982
And you like it.

206
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:33,069
Oh! You're taking my
breath away!

207
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:46,749
You!

208
00:18:54,757 --> 00:18:56,759
Now here's something
for your eye!

209
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:04,851
But Hans, mein liebling...

210
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:07,812
you have not been listening
to a word I have been saying.

211
00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:09,814
Hans!

212
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:10,940
Yes, Frieda.

213
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:13,609
You have not been
listening to me.

214
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:15,736
Yes I have, Frieda, I have.

215
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:17,572
Then what was I saying?

216
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:21,659
You were saying.. You were saying..
What were you saying?

217
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:26,539
I was saying tonight you must not
smoke such a big cigar.

218
00:19:26,622 --> 00:19:29,208
Your voice was very bad
in tonight's show.

219
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:32,295
Please, Frieda!
Don't tell me what to do!

220
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:34,672
When I want a cigar
I smoke a cigar!

221
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:38,509
I want no orders
from a woman!

222
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:41,721
Ah, Hans...

223
00:19:42,221 --> 00:19:45,808
this is the first time since
we have been engaged...

224
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:49,353
you have spoken to me so.

225
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:51,314
Why is it?

226
00:19:54,108 --> 00:19:56,235
Oh, Frijy, I'm sorry. I...

227
00:19:57,153 --> 00:19:59,238
Ah, here's our coffee.

228
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,159
Five lumps of sugar in each.

229
00:20:09,832 --> 00:20:12,043
Say, the little imp spent
some francs on this.

230
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,088
Yes, he did, very.
We're doing very well.

231
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:23,804
But I don't like fruit.

232
00:20:25,097 --> 00:20:27,433
You should eat a lot.
It's good for you.

233
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:29,936
Next time I tell him
I like champagne.

234
00:20:34,273 --> 00:20:35,233
Who is it?

235
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,192
Hans.

236
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:46,285
Who?

237
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:47,620
Hans.

238
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:52,083
Oh, my darling, your basket
of fruit was lovely.

239
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,751
But I... am... uh...

240
00:20:54,377 --> 00:20:56,671
I'm taking a nap.

241
00:20:57,296 --> 00:20:58,923
Can't you come back later?

242
00:20:58,965 --> 00:20:59,924
Yes, fraeulein.

243
00:21:00,383 --> 00:21:02,426
Oh, thank you, dear.

244
00:21:07,848 --> 00:21:10,434
You'll spoil everything
if he hears you.

245
00:21:20,361 --> 00:21:22,071
What's the matter?
You ain't singing as usual.

246
00:21:23,364 --> 00:21:26,075
Oh, this morning I have
such a big washing to do.

247
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:28,077
How's Hans?

248
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:33,791
I said... how's Hans?

249
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,752
Oh, Hans is fine.
Thank you, he's fine.

250
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:42,299
Frieda, something's wrong.
What is it?

251
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:46,178
Oh, nothing...

252
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:51,600
only...well...that Cleopatra
woman... my Hans...

253
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,228
Oh, I cannot tell you.

254
00:21:54,228 --> 00:21:55,980
She's still after Hans, ain't she.

255
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:59,150
Yeah.
Always she's smiling by him.

256
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:01,736
Yeah, well if she smiles
by somebody I know...

257
00:22:01,736 --> 00:22:04,238
she'll have to buy herself
a new set of teeth.

258
00:22:04,447 --> 00:22:08,033
But why is it we women
always have got to worry?

259
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:11,620
Oh, it's always been that way.
I guess it always will be.

260
00:22:12,163 --> 00:22:15,124
Yeah. And by me she has no shame.

261
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,961
Always when I can hear
it, she says to him:

262
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,757
"Many thanks, my darling,
for the flowers."

263
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:25,426
"Thanks, my darling, for this,"...

264
00:22:25,885 --> 00:22:27,928
...and "Thanks, my darling, for that."

265
00:22:28,637 --> 00:22:31,307
Always something
he is give her.

266
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:34,435
Oh, don't you worry, Frieda,
he doesn't love her...

267
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:37,188
that big horse!

268
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:39,940
Yes, but she keeps after him.

269
00:22:40,608 --> 00:22:42,109
That's why I worry.

270
00:22:46,363 --> 00:22:47,698
Why not pink tights...

271
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:50,117
you know, with spangles
all around.

272
00:22:50,117 --> 00:22:52,036
It'll show her figure off more.

273
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:54,872
No. Nein. No tights!

274
00:22:55,623 --> 00:22:56,415
Without tights.

275
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:59,168
You know that stuff...
they're flimsy...

276
00:22:59,293 --> 00:23:03,005
What you call that stuff?
We'll see her through it.

277
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:04,924
Why not like Lady Godiva?

278
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,094
Yeah, that's it.

279
00:23:09,094 --> 00:23:11,388
We'll have her ride
the feathered white horse.

280
00:23:11,388 --> 00:23:14,808
What have you in
your sawdust heads!

281
00:23:21,398 --> 00:23:22,650
What's the matter!
What's the matter!

282
00:23:22,858 --> 00:23:25,194
Oh, I think I sprained
my shoulder last night.

283
00:23:26,028 --> 00:23:27,112
Give a rub, will you?

284
00:23:30,658 --> 00:23:33,702
Further, further...

285
00:23:34,745 --> 00:23:37,122
Down, down...

286
00:23:37,748 --> 00:23:40,584
Over, over...

287
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:46,840
Oh, it's so good to be rubbed.

288
00:23:46,924 --> 00:23:48,676
Our card, lady.

289
00:23:48,926 --> 00:23:50,261
What for?

290
00:23:50,594 --> 00:23:52,429
A fellow rubber from Berlin.

291
00:24:01,063 --> 00:24:01,897
That reminds me...

292
00:24:02,898 --> 00:24:04,692
I had a swell
dream about you last night.

293
00:24:05,025 --> 00:24:05,859
Oh, you did?

294
00:24:05,985 --> 00:24:06,568
Yeah!

295
00:24:07,069 --> 00:24:09,655
You were standing in a
bathing suit on a rock...

296
00:24:10,364 --> 00:24:11,740
you know, like a statue.

297
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:15,452
And the wind was blowing through your hair,
and the waves were washing around you...

298
00:24:15,911 --> 00:24:18,497
And your figure...
How it stood out.

299
00:24:18,497 --> 00:24:19,915
It looked great.

300
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,167
Say...

301
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:24,878
You have got a good figure.

302
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:28,007
Oh, do you think so?

303
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:29,008
Sure...

304
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:31,135
Hey Phroso!

305
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:34,471
Did you try that gag
I told you about?

306
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:38,475
Yeah, I did, and it was a wow.
Get up here, Johnny...

307
00:24:38,475 --> 00:24:39,518
and I'll show it to you.

308
00:24:40,227 --> 00:24:42,604
I did everything you told me
and it laid 'em right in the sawdust.

309
00:24:42,938 --> 00:24:44,189
Watch this. Venus, watch this.

310
00:24:45,107 --> 00:24:45,899
Hello, Venus.

311
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,317
Hello, Johnny.

312
00:24:47,693 --> 00:24:50,070
Say, Phroso...
What else did you dream?

313
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:53,532
Then the dream changed
and we was in Paris.

314
00:24:53,532 --> 00:24:56,618
Yeah, at the opera, right in the
front box. We were all dressed up.

315
00:24:56,618 --> 00:24:58,162
Oh gee, what'd I have on?

316
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,165
And did I look swell.
Everybody was pointing at me.

317
00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:03,959
They were saying,
"That's Phroso, the clown."

318
00:25:04,334 --> 00:25:06,545
And was I embarrassed.

319
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,716
- Well, did they say anything about me?
- Sure, sure.

320
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:12,217
What'd they say?

321
00:25:12,551 --> 00:25:15,471
Hit me. Go ahead, hit me!

322
00:25:16,263 --> 00:25:17,723
On the head. Hit me!

323
00:25:29,026 --> 00:25:29,860
Oh, that's how it is.

324
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,945
You don't think it's funny?

325
00:25:32,154 --> 00:25:35,908
It's sad, is it? Well, it was just
panicking 'em... that's how sad it is.

326
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:42,664
No!

327
00:25:43,957 --> 00:25:45,000
When?

328
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:46,960
Come on!

329
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:51,298
Come on, Venus

330
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,633
the bearded lady's baby's born!

331
00:26:10,526 --> 00:26:11,527
Oh, ain't it beautiful!

332
00:26:11,985 --> 00:26:13,195
- What is it?
- A girl.

333
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,074
Oh boy, that's great...
and it's gonna have a beard.

334
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:26,041
- Ah, how's the proud father?
- Fine.

335
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:27,626
- What was it?
- A girl.

336
00:26:27,876 --> 00:26:30,337
Better luck next time.
You might get a couple of Smith Brothers.

337
00:26:30,504 --> 00:26:31,338
I'm trying.

338
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,474
Please, Violet, please don't
quarrel with him any more.

339
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:45,227
Oh well, if he's going to
say anything, let him say it.


340
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:47,604
Don't let him "p-p-p" for an hour.

341
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:53,110
Say, you're going to do as I say.
I'm the b-b-boss of my home.

342
00:26:53,318 --> 00:26:54,820
Half of it, you mean.

343
00:26:54,861 --> 00:26:56,488
Please, please, Violet.

344
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:59,950
Listen here, I d-don't want those tramps
you...

345
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,785
g-go with hanging around my wife.

346
00:27:02,202 --> 00:27:05,372
Oh, be quiet! Hook up our dress.

347
00:27:05,372 --> 00:27:08,083
Oh, your d-dress.
I'll hook it up and...

348
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,543
something else.

349
00:27:10,043 --> 00:27:12,337
And another thing. You gotta cut out getting...

350
00:27:12,337 --> 00:27:14,464
d-drunk every night, too.

351
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:15,674
Is that so?

352
00:27:15,674 --> 00:27:18,635
Yeah. I'm not gonna have my wife laying...

353
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:21,596
in b-bed half a day with your hangover.

354
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,015
Come on, Daisy, let's get out of here.

355
00:27:23,015 --> 00:27:26,518
Oh no she d-don't.
She's gonna stay right here.

356
00:27:26,852 --> 00:27:28,353
Come on, I gotta go.

357
00:27:29,229 --> 00:27:33,734
Ah, phooey! You're always using that
for an excu- excu-

358
00:27:33,734 --> 00:27:35,402
 for an alib-b-bi.

359
00:27:42,784 --> 00:27:44,953
Cleopatra ain't one of us.

360
00:27:45,495 --> 00:27:48,332
Why, we're just filthy things to her.

361
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:52,669
She'd spit on Hans
if he wasn't giving her presents.

362
00:27:53,378 --> 00:27:56,465
Let her try it.
Let her try...

363
00:27:56,465 --> 00:27:58,884
doing anything to one of us.

364
00:27:59,384 --> 00:28:00,260
You're right.

365
00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:02,179
She don't know us.

366
00:28:02,304 --> 00:28:04,598
But she'll find out.

367
00:28:06,892 --> 00:28:07,851
There you are.

368
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:16,026
I kinda peeked out the
corner of my eye and caught...

369
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:18,153
Madame Tetrallini giving us the once over.

370
00:28:18,987 --> 00:28:20,614
I guess she knows she's got
a good act...

371
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,240
one of the best in the business.

372
00:28:22,991 --> 00:28:24,534
It isn't only our act that gets them.

373
00:28:24,618 --> 00:28:26,244
We've got personality.

374
00:28:26,286 --> 00:28:27,913
We know how to sell the stuff.

375
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,125
Same way in the last town.
Never heard such applause in your life.

376
00:28:33,126 --> 00:28:35,629
Let me tell you something that
everybody around here don't know.

377
00:28:35,629 --> 00:28:37,672
We're only killing time with this circus.

378
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,467
We've got bigger time to follow.

379
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:42,344
And we can do it too.

380
00:28:43,345 --> 00:28:43,970
Well...

381
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:46,515
Catch our act tomorrow night.
We've got something new.

382
00:28:46,556 --> 00:28:48,350
Anything I can do in the act, bro??

383
00:28:55,315 --> 00:28:58,026
Oh, Schlitzey, what a pretty dress.

384
00:28:58,026 --> 00:29:00,695
Oh, how beautiful you look tonight.

385
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:08,036
You're just a man's woman.
You know what I mean? Huh? You.

386
00:29:11,331 --> 00:29:11,706
If you're a good girl,

387
00:29:11,748 --> 00:29:14,251
when I get to
Paris I'm gonna buy you a big hat...

388
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:16,711
with a looong beautiful feather on it.

389
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,260
Oh, hello, Elvira...

390
00:29:23,301 --> 00:29:24,177
Hello, Jenny-Lee.

391
00:29:25,804 --> 00:29:28,974
Hasn't Schlitzey got a beautiful dress?
Isn't that pretty?

392
00:29:29,432 --> 00:29:31,518
When I get to Paris I'm gonna
buy her a big hat...

393
00:29:31,518 --> 00:29:33,436
with a looong feather on it.


394
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,106
And if you're a good girl, when I get to Paris...

395
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:38,525
I'm gonna buy you a hat with a bigger feather on it.

396
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:48,118
Why, Schlitzey, what's the matter?

397
00:29:53,665 --> 00:29:56,001
Oh, I'm sorry, Schlitzey.

398
00:30:04,551 --> 00:30:07,095
Did you see him?
He's out there again tonight.

399
00:30:07,637 --> 00:30:09,389
He followed you from the last town.

400
00:30:09,389 --> 00:30:12,267
I know it, and if Eddie sees us
there'll be a fight.

401
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,185
Why? It's not your fault.

402
00:30:14,185 --> 00:30:17,480
Ah, there you are, Frances. Thought you'd gone to bed.

403
00:30:17,814 --> 00:30:18,565
Hello, Rollo.

404
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:21,484
Well, hear that crowd out there again tonight?

405
00:30:22,402 --> 00:30:24,154
I bet you thought the tent was on fire, huh?

406
00:30:24,946 --> 00:30:25,947
Well, it wasn't.

407
00:30:26,823 --> 00:30:28,908
Just the Rollo Brothers panicking 'em again.

408
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:31,077
But then we do it in every town.

409
00:30:32,037 --> 00:30:34,080
We're so used to it,
it's getting monotonous.

410
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:37,292
Hey, come on and take a look
at our act tomorrow night.

411
00:30:38,084 --> 00:30:41,421
Careful! Careful!
Don't waste any of it.

412
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:45,467
Look how it sparkles.

413
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,010
Like your eyes.

414
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:50,472
Dancing, gay, with bubbles.

415
00:30:55,602 --> 00:30:57,020
Oh, it's delicious.

416
00:30:59,064 --> 00:31:01,358
Mmmm. Nice, nice.

417
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:05,195
It comes by the finest vineyards of France.

418
00:31:06,237 --> 00:31:07,947
Have you sent for it specially for me?

419
00:31:08,323 --> 00:31:11,701
For the most beautiful
woman in all the world.

420
00:31:12,452 --> 00:31:13,828
Darling!

421
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:22,337
Hello there, baby.
Hey, where you been so long?

422
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,924
You're a funny guy, Phroso.

423
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,968
Sometimes you panic me.

424
00:31:28,968 --> 00:31:31,137
Don't I know it. I panic the world.

425
00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:33,348
because I use my noodle.

426
00:31:33,932 --> 00:31:36,810
I think up funny gags. I make the world laugh.

427
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:39,687
With me, clowning is an art.

428
00:31:42,649 --> 00:31:44,776
Hey, why the hat? The head cold?

429
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:47,737
Thought you and me had a date to go out.

430
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:50,323
Oh! I forgot all about it.

431
00:31:51,157 --> 00:31:53,785
Well, I'm into this now. I gotta go through with it.


432
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,662
Well, make it snappy, will ya.

433
00:31:56,287 --> 00:31:58,039
I'm all dolled up for the occasion.

434
00:31:58,081 --> 00:31:59,833
Sorry, kid, can't do it now.

435
00:32:04,838 --> 00:32:06,714
We'll make it some other time, huh?

436
00:32:09,217 --> 00:32:11,511
Aw, don't feel that way about it.  I just got this idea...

437
00:32:11,511 --> 00:32:13,263
all of a sudden and I gotta finish it.


438
00:32:15,265 --> 00:32:16,516
Funny gag, isn't it?

439
00:32:16,724 --> 00:32:19,018
Yeah. I'm laughing myself sick.

440
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,147
Aw, say, come on.

441
00:32:24,774 --> 00:32:27,902
Honey. Hey. Come on, come on, come on.

442
00:32:28,528 --> 00:32:30,280
Now, now, now, now.

443
00:32:32,407 --> 00:32:33,616
That's much better.

444
00:32:38,997 --> 00:32:40,790
That's the first time you ever done that!

445
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:43,334
Ain't the first time I felt like doing it.

446
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:44,335
Yeah?

447
00:32:46,588 --> 00:32:47,380
Venus!

448
00:32:52,635 --> 00:32:55,096
I don't mind telling you
I wanted to do this for a long time.

449
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,308
So've I, Phroso.

450
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,982
Well, we're all set now, hey Venus?

451
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,568
We're all set now!

452
00:33:10,069 --> 00:33:11,988
Please. Please do.

453
00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:15,658
Don't you want to make me happy?

454
00:33:16,784 --> 00:33:19,495
Yes...but I don't know what to say.

455
00:33:19,787 --> 00:33:20,872
Just say yes, dear.

456
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:24,334
Will you?

457
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:27,295
Yes.

458
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,755
Oh, Violet.

459
00:33:38,264 --> 00:33:40,767
What are you kicking about?
You got a good wife. You're happy.

460
00:33:41,184 --> 00:33:43,853
Oh, that sister-in-law of mine, 
she wants to...

461
00:33:43,895 --> 00:33:46,564
sit up half the n-night r-reading.

462
00:33:49,442 --> 00:33:50,234
Gee, that's tough.

463
00:33:50,443 --> 00:33:51,778
Tough! You b-b-

464
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,879
Cleo's gone on a d-d-diet!

465
00:34:15,927 --> 00:34:17,220
It's awfully sweet of you to say that.

466
00:34:17,553 --> 00:34:19,972
And I know Violet will be happy.

467
00:34:19,972 --> 00:34:21,432
Oh, here's Roscoe.

468
00:34:24,936 --> 00:34:25,937
Rosco... M.Vadja.

469
00:34:26,437 --> 00:34:28,231
Glad to m-m-meetcha.

470
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,566
Violet and he are engaged to be married.

471
00:34:31,192 --> 00:34:32,026
Oh, yeah?

472
00:34:32,735 --> 00:34:35,238
Yes, and you must come to see us sometime.

473
00:34:36,406 --> 00:34:39,325
Thanks. You must come to v-v-v-

474
00:34:39,325 --> 00:34:41,786
come to see us sometime, too.

475
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:44,247
I certainly will. Thanks.

476
00:34:52,547 --> 00:34:53,047
Who is it?

477
00:34:59,554 --> 00:35:01,055
It's Frieda, Hans.

478
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:08,271
May I come in?

479
00:35:09,355 --> 00:35:10,481
Yes, Frieda.

480
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:31,377
Now that I'm here,
I don't know how to say it...

481
00:35:31,711 --> 00:35:33,880
How to make you understand.

482
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:38,759
If you knew how I feel, Hans,

483
00:35:38,801 --> 00:35:41,137
to come to you about her.

484
00:35:42,013 --> 00:35:44,515
Oh, Frieda, I'm so sorry.


485
00:35:44,515 --> 00:35:46,851
I don't want to hurt you.

486
00:35:49,979 --> 00:35:52,857
If you could be happy, Hans...

487
00:35:52,899 --> 00:35:54,984
I would not care.

488
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,236
But I am happy, Frieda.

489
00:35:57,236 --> 00:35:59,280
Never in my life was I so happy.

490
00:36:00,781 --> 00:36:01,574
No, Hans.

491
00:36:02,033 --> 00:36:04,118
You think it only.

492
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:06,746
For you she cannot bring happiness.

493
00:36:06,746 --> 00:36:08,331
Ah, Frieda!

494
00:36:08,414 --> 00:36:10,333
You don't know!

495
00:36:14,337 --> 00:36:15,630
But I do, Hans.

496
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:19,800
You think because she's so
beautiful and I'm just a mi...

497
00:36:20,259 --> 00:36:21,510
Don't, Hans!

498
00:36:21,928 --> 00:36:25,640
To me you're a man.

499
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,352
But to her you're only something to laugh at.

500
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:32,938
The whole circus, they make
fun by you and her.

501
00:36:34,065 --> 00:36:36,567
Let them laugh, the swine!

502
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:39,862
I love her. They can't hurt me.

503
00:36:41,155 --> 00:36:43,449
But they hurt me.

504
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:47,870
Frieda, I have been a coward.

505
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,790
I should have come to you in the beginning.

506
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,958
Please forgive me?

507
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:56,629
Yes, Hans, I forgive you.

508
00:36:57,004 --> 00:37:01,342
It is only that you should be happy I want.

509
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:07,848
You won't worry now, will you?

510
00:37:08,516 --> 00:37:12,061
No, I won't worry.

511
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:20,236
Nice, very nice, hmm?

512
00:37:25,616 --> 00:37:28,536
It's platinum! Hey, where do you think...

513
00:37:28,536 --> 00:37:30,663
the little pollywog is getting his money?

514
00:37:35,459 --> 00:37:36,794
Being so particular!

515
00:37:36,836 --> 00:37:39,130
What do you care where the
money comes from.

516
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:42,049
How much is it worth?

517
00:37:43,342 --> 00:37:45,302
We got five hundred for the bracelet...

518
00:37:45,302 --> 00:37:47,263
but this looks like thousands!

519
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:51,142
I think next time I'll take a fur coat.

520
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,149
Say, that little ape's got ideas about you.

521
00:37:58,524 --> 00:37:59,150
Jealous?

522
00:37:59,942 --> 00:38:03,529
Me? I'll squash him like a bug.

523
00:38:05,865 --> 00:38:08,784
That's his knock.
I'll get rid of him. Go quickly!

524
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,041
Come in.

525
00:38:23,048 --> 00:38:23,674
What do you want?

526
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,973
It's about Hans.

527
00:38:34,143 --> 00:38:35,853
Well? I'm listening.

528
00:38:38,147 --> 00:38:40,024
It's behind his back...

529
00:38:40,024 --> 00:38:41,942
everybody's laughing.

530
00:38:41,942 --> 00:38:43,861
Because he's in love with you.

531
00:38:45,237 --> 00:38:45,988
Go on.

532
00:38:48,365 --> 00:38:51,243
I know you just make fun.

533
00:38:51,243 --> 00:38:54,121
But Hans, he does not know this.

534
00:38:54,205 --> 00:38:56,916
If he finds out...

535
00:38:56,916 --> 00:38:59,543
never again will he be happy.

536
00:39:00,502 --> 00:39:03,505
What makes you think
that I'm just making fun?

537
00:39:04,173 --> 00:39:06,175
Your face... so beautiful...

538
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:09,053
and Hans is so little,

539
00:39:09,136 --> 00:39:10,804
so cute, eh?

540
00:39:11,096 --> 00:39:14,141
Well, maybe I'm going to marry him!

541
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:17,895
If you marry, it will be at you...

542
00:39:17,895 --> 00:39:20,230
they laugh and stare!

543
00:39:20,564 --> 00:39:23,317
Of course. Nothing like being different.

544
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,111
Cleopatra, queen of the air...

545
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:28,864
married to a dwarf!

546
00:39:30,658 --> 00:39:31,659
A dwarf!

547
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:33,369
A dwarf!

548
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,872
Then it's not for Hans you care!

549
00:39:36,872 --> 00:39:38,123
It's the money!

550
00:39:38,415 --> 00:39:40,084
Money.

551
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:43,337
You... Little mind reader.

552
00:39:44,254 --> 00:39:46,757
He has told you of the

553
00:39:46,757 --> 00:39:49,176
fortune he has inherited, eh?..

554
00:39:51,345 --> 00:39:53,973
Always he warned me to tell no one...

555
00:39:54,014 --> 00:39:56,642
until after we leave the circus.

556
00:39:58,602 --> 00:40:00,437
A fortune...

557
00:40:00,437 --> 00:40:04,608
and fancy you knowing about it too.

558
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:08,779
Well, I can't be angry at him for that.

559
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,244
No! No! You cannot do this!

560
00:40:17,871 --> 00:40:20,791
Hmm, you wait and see.

561
00:40:23,794 --> 00:40:26,922
Please, you can't.

562
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:36,390
A fortune!

563
00:40:36,598 --> 00:40:38,976
I bet the little lame's worth billions!

564
00:40:39,977 --> 00:40:43,522
A fortune! Can you beat that!

565
00:40:44,648 --> 00:40:47,651
A fortune! And I have him like that.

566
00:40:48,277 --> 00:40:51,447
A fool he ain't.
He knew enough to keep his mouth shut.

567
00:40:51,822 --> 00:40:52,906
I could marry him.

568
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,453
He would marry me.

569
00:41:04,543 --> 00:41:08,172
Midgets...are not strong...

570
00:41:10,174 --> 00:41:11,758
They could get sick.

571
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:13,760
How?

572
00:41:16,221 --> 00:41:17,055
It could be done...

573
00:41:19,308 --> 00:41:21,894
done... Slowly.

574
00:41:25,814 --> 00:41:28,108
The Wedding Feast.

575
00:41:57,095 --> 00:41:58,555
Oh, come on, my little precious, let's drink.

576
00:42:00,265 --> 00:42:01,683
Be happy! Drink!

577
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:10,984
Hey, K-Koo Koo,
give somebody else a chance!

578
00:42:17,074 --> 00:42:18,659
All right, professor.

579
00:42:19,076 --> 00:42:20,494
A waltz, please.

580
00:42:34,633 --> 00:42:37,135
Show him up, Volcano!

581
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:51,191
Our wedding night!

582
00:42:54,569 --> 00:42:56,071
What a thrill!

583
00:42:56,738 --> 00:43:00,409
Never before did I think I should be so lucky.

584
00:43:06,123 --> 00:43:08,417
I'm the lucky one,

585
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:10,210
my little Hans.

586
00:43:11,378 --> 00:43:14,589
My Cleo's happy...happy.

587
00:43:14,673 --> 00:43:15,132
Happy?

588
00:43:20,512 --> 00:43:23,849
I'm so happy I even could kiss you,

589
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:26,059
...you big homely...

590
00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:27,853
brute!

591
00:43:44,286 --> 00:43:48,290
Ah, my little green-eyed monster.

592
00:43:51,001 --> 00:43:53,503
My husband is jealous!

593
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,383
He loves me!

594
00:44:07,642 --> 00:44:09,728
Come, my little lover.

595
00:44:10,395 --> 00:44:11,646
Drink to the...

596
00:44:11,646 --> 00:44:14,941
happiness of your loving wife.

597
00:44:21,323 --> 00:44:23,033
Attention! Attention!

598
00:44:23,492 --> 00:44:26,036
We'll make her one of us.

599
00:44:26,036 --> 00:44:28,580
A loving cup! A loving cup!

600
00:44:28,747 --> 00:44:32,626
We accept her...one of us...
We accept her...one of us...

601
00:44:34,336 --> 00:44:36,796
We accept her... We accept her...

602
00:44:44,846 --> 00:44:46,848
They're going to make you
one of them,

603
00:44:46,848 --> 00:44:48,850
my peacock!

604
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:56,334
You!

605
00:45:57,752 --> 00:46:00,672
Dirty!.. Slimy!..

606
00:46:00,964 --> 00:46:02,132
Freaks!

607
00:46:02,132 --> 00:46:05,760
Freaks! Freaks! Get out of here!

608
00:46:09,305 --> 00:46:11,391
Get out! You heard her! Get out!

609
00:46:18,231 --> 00:46:19,941
You filth!

610
00:46:20,859 --> 00:46:24,112
Make me one of you, will you!

611
00:46:24,154 --> 00:46:26,573
Well, what are you going to do?

612
00:46:27,407 --> 00:46:29,909
What are you a man or a baby!

613
00:46:30,827 --> 00:46:34,247
Please! Please!
You make me ashamed.

614
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:36,750
Ashamed! You!

615
00:46:38,668 --> 00:46:41,171
Holy Christmas!

616
00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:46,426
What must I do? Must I play games with you?

617
00:46:46,634 --> 00:46:48,928
Must Mamma take you horsey-back ride?

618
00:46:49,345 --> 00:46:52,640
Ha, ha, that's it! Horsey-back ride!

619
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,604
Come, come, my little fly speck.

620
00:46:58,188 --> 00:47:02,358
Momma is going to take you horsey-back ride.

621
00:47:06,738 --> 00:47:08,531
Geddy-up! Geddy-up!

622
00:47:26,174 --> 00:47:27,383
Ah forget it, Hans.

623
00:47:28,259 --> 00:47:30,220
She is sorry. I am sorry.

624
00:47:31,387 --> 00:47:32,847
Didn't I told you she was drunk?

625
00:47:33,473 --> 00:47:36,601
Didn't I told you we was only having a little fun?

626
00:47:38,186 --> 00:47:40,355
Please. I...

627
00:47:41,606 --> 00:47:45,318
I understand...everything.

628
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,194
No, you don't

629
00:47:47,946 --> 00:47:50,323
I tell you, there's nothing between me and Cleo.


630
00:47:50,406 --> 00:47:51,533
Oh, be quiet!

631
00:47:52,659 --> 00:47:54,661
Haven't you done enough damage for one  night!

632
00:47:55,328 --> 00:47:58,498
Don't you realize what I'm being accused of?

633
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,125
I ain't going to be blamed for something I have not done.

634
00:48:03,419 --> 00:48:05,797
I don't blame you, Cleo.

635
00:48:07,674 --> 00:48:10,009
I don't blame Hercules.

636
00:48:11,427 --> 00:48:14,639
Only me, myself.

637
00:48:15,723 --> 00:48:19,477
Now you're talking like a man.

638
00:48:20,061 --> 00:48:20,895
You fool!

639
00:48:24,357 --> 00:48:26,651
Always I should have known...

640
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,696
you would only laugh at me.

641
00:48:31,155 --> 00:48:34,117
My sweet, I'd rather fall from the trapeze and

642
00:48:34,117 --> 00:48:37,078
break my neck, than hurt your feelings.

643
00:48:38,454 --> 00:48:39,497
Do you understand now?

644
00:48:40,623 --> 00:48:41,916
It was only a joke.

645
00:48:47,213 --> 00:48:51,050
Our wedding...a joke?

646
00:48:54,178 --> 00:48:56,764
Now I know how funny it is.

647
00:48:58,224 --> 00:49:00,601
Hans, the midget!

648
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:07,400
Hans, the fool!

649
00:49:12,113 --> 00:49:14,782
Everywhere they're laughing.

650
00:49:14,824 --> 00:49:17,285
Laughing! Laughing! Laughing! Oh!

651
00:49:24,709 --> 00:49:25,835
You give him too much.

652
00:49:26,419 --> 00:49:27,378
No, I haven't.

653
00:49:27,879 --> 00:49:29,213
I know what I am doing.

654
00:49:30,673 --> 00:49:32,467
Come on. Pick him up.

655
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:07,794
Doctor, what is it?

656
00:50:08,836 --> 00:50:09,879
What caused it?

657
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:13,424
Poison.

658
00:50:23,851 --> 00:50:26,479
A bad case of ptomaine poisoning.

659
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:32,610
Doctor, did I do wrong then,

660
00:50:33,236 --> 00:50:34,904
giving him mustard water?

661
00:50:37,281 --> 00:50:39,033
Probably it saved his life.

662
00:50:50,127 --> 00:50:53,172
Never before did he drink like that.

663
00:50:54,423 --> 00:50:57,134
But she kept making him and making him.

664
00:50:58,594 --> 00:50:59,762
Drink, huh?

665
00:51:27,957 --> 00:51:29,584
You better get Cleo to tell the doctor...

666
00:51:29,584 --> 00:51:31,210
what she put in that wine last night.

667
00:51:32,336 --> 00:51:33,379
What you talking about, eh?

668
00:51:33,462 --> 00:51:35,256
The stuff she put in the wine!

669
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:36,841
You're crazy.

670
00:51:36,841 --> 00:51:39,927
Yeah? Well, you can't get away with it.
I'll tell the coppers.

671
00:51:41,846 --> 00:51:43,556
So, hey, tell on your own people?

672
00:51:43,556 --> 00:51:45,266
My people are decent circus folks.

673
00:51:45,266 --> 00:51:48,477
Not dirty rats what would
kill a freak to get his money.

674
00:51:49,061 --> 00:51:49,895
Dirty little...

675
00:51:57,903 --> 00:51:59,447
Your imagination's
getting the best of you.


676
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:00,656
Yeah? Maybe it is.

677
00:52:01,365 --> 00:52:02,700
But coppers don't have imagination,

678
00:52:03,117 --> 00:52:04,243
so I've been told.

679
00:52:06,996 --> 00:52:09,707
Don't make me have to go to 'em.

680
00:53:01,717 --> 00:53:03,803
- Cleo?
- Yes?

681
00:53:04,887 --> 00:53:07,056
It has been the fifth night...

682
00:53:08,182 --> 00:53:10,017
we have been married.

683
00:53:11,811 --> 00:53:14,313
A week since I have said...

684
00:53:14,438 --> 00:53:17,358
all those things to you.

685
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:19,443
Don't, don't.

686
00:53:20,486 --> 00:53:24,406
Never can I forgive myself
for what I've said.

687
00:53:25,074 --> 00:53:27,910
I've forgotten. Nothing matters,

688
00:53:27,993 --> 00:53:31,038
except for you to be well.

689
00:53:33,707 --> 00:53:36,502
How good you are by me, Cleo.

690
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,839
I must fix your medicine,

691
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,173
or I'll be late.

692
00:54:52,244 --> 00:54:54,371
I'll be soon back, my little.

693
00:54:54,747 --> 00:54:56,457
Don't be lonely.

694
00:54:58,125 --> 00:55:02,129
I'll never forget what
you are doing for me, Cleo.

695
00:55:02,421 --> 00:55:04,965
But it's what I want to do, my darling.

696
00:55:08,344 --> 00:55:09,511
Now, now I must hurry.

697
00:55:10,429 --> 00:55:11,263
Cleo!

698
00:55:12,765 --> 00:55:14,850
Will you leave the door open, please?

699
00:55:15,643 --> 00:55:17,478
Yes, my darling.

700
00:56:07,528 --> 00:56:08,278
Tonight.

701
00:56:08,612 --> 00:56:10,197
They will be ready.

702
00:56:10,948 --> 00:56:12,950
All right. You come to my wagon.

703
00:56:22,584 --> 00:56:27,131
"I must hurry now and fix your medicine,
my darling,

704
00:56:27,798 --> 00:56:29,299
 or I will be late..."

705
00:56:32,886 --> 00:56:34,763
"Dirty.. Slimy..

706
00:56:36,098 --> 00:56:36,890
Freaks."

707
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:04,459
- He's waiting.
- Fine...fine.

708
00:57:21,685 --> 00:57:22,686
Soon we go.

709
00:57:54,134 --> 00:57:56,511
Ah, you're imagining things.

710
00:57:56,553 --> 00:57:58,931
No. Then I hear Hercules tell...

711
00:57:58,972 --> 00:58:01,350
Cleo, "Venus knows too much."

712
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:03,352
Hercules..? Venus..?

713
00:58:05,771 --> 00:58:06,772
Oh, no!

714
00:58:09,441 --> 00:58:10,192
Thanks, Frieda.

715
00:58:20,994 --> 00:58:23,330
My little, you must go to sleep.

716
00:58:23,372 --> 00:58:25,707
Your friends better go now.

717
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:27,793
I like them here.

718
00:58:28,126 --> 00:58:31,630
No, no, no, Hans.
They can come back tomorrow.

719
00:58:32,047 --> 00:58:35,634
I will give you your medicine
and get you off to sleep.

720
00:58:36,093 --> 00:58:39,346
Go, go on, all of you, quick, quick.

721
00:58:49,731 --> 00:58:50,649
What's this?

722
00:58:50,982 --> 00:58:52,776
Give me the little black bottle.

723
00:59:21,263 --> 00:59:21,972
The bottle.

724
00:59:29,521 --> 00:59:33,775
You got this full of poison...to kill.

725
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:01,595
Phroso!

726
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,689
Get out, Venus!

727
01:00:26,286 --> 01:00:27,329
Get out, Venus!

728
01:00:27,329 --> 01:00:28,371
Get out!

729
01:00:30,207 --> 01:00:31,166
Help, please!

730
01:02:21,151 --> 01:02:24,028
How she got that way will never be known.

731
01:02:25,196 --> 01:02:26,614
Some say a jealous lover.

732
01:02:27,073 --> 01:02:27,866
Others...

733
01:02:28,324 --> 01:02:31,244
that it was the code of the freaks.

734
01:02:32,954 --> 01:02:34,372
Others, the storm.

735
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,877
Believe it or not, there she is.

736
01:02:53,016 --> 01:02:54,601
But, sir, they insist on seeing you.

737
01:02:55,685 --> 01:02:58,188
You know how I feel. I'm seeing no one.

738
01:02:59,022 --> 01:03:02,108
Have I not told you, Fritz?...
Send them away.

739
01:03:02,692 --> 01:03:03,693
Very good, sir.

740
01:03:05,195 --> 01:03:06,988
I can see no one.

741
01:03:07,405 --> 01:03:08,990
Excuse me, sir, you can't come in.

742
01:03:09,032 --> 01:03:09,991
Can't I?

743
01:03:10,033 --> 01:03:11,618
- No, sir, I have my orders.
- Well, I'm in ain't I?

744
01:03:13,703 --> 01:03:14,913
Oh, yes you can, Hansy old boy.

745
01:03:15,288 --> 01:03:16,998
There's someone you just gotta see.

746
01:03:18,416 --> 01:03:20,210
Why did you come here?

747
01:03:21,586 --> 01:03:25,006
Please, Hans, don't be angry.

748
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:29,385
Venus and Phroso have been so kind by me.

749
01:03:30,803 --> 01:03:35,600
Please, go away... I can't see no one.

750
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:41,522
But Hans, you tried to stop them.

751
01:03:43,399 --> 01:03:45,318
It was only the poison you wanted.

752
01:03:47,612 --> 01:03:49,322
It wasn't your fault.

753
01:03:52,116 --> 01:03:55,203
Don't...don't worry, Hans.

754
01:03:56,788 --> 01:04:00,291
Come to me, my lieber.
Don't cry.

755
01:04:01,793 --> 01:04:03,544
Don't, Hans.

756
01:04:04,254 --> 01:04:05,213
Don't cry.

757
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:08,091
I love you.

758
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:11,636
I love you.
