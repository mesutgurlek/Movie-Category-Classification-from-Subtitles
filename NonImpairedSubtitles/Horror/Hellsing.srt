1
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,950
Five Three Zero Zero, Roger.

2
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,220
Standing by in the sky until
ground troops arrive.

3
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,620
Target Identified.

4
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,360
Releasing the Control Art Restriction
System to Level Three.

5
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,630
Please, come in.

6
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,000
You don't want another drink?

7
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,220
I want to get down on
my knees this instant...

8
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:49,890
and caress your legs
to admire all of your beauty.

9
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,760
But I lack the youth to do that.

10
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,670
I was very fortunate
to meet you at the party.

11
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,910
I knew you were the kind of person...

12
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,010
who could share my new
type of pleasure.

13
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,650
We don't need the illusion of light.

14
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,350
I can feel your beauty very well,
just like this.

15
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,900
You have a very nice scent.

16
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,300
Who's that?

17
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,800
Who's there?!

18
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,770
Situation C.

19
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,440
Keeping the power
restriction unlocked...

20
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,640
until the target has been silenced.

21
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,350
Who are you?!
Where do you think this is?!

22
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,610
The Royal Order of Religious Knights...

23
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,260
What did you say?!

24
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,560
Wait! Wait a minute!

25
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,320
Out of the way, human!

26
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,430
Unless you want to become
a shit-like ghoul!

27
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,320
Vam... pi... re...!

28
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,320
Limited Release Completed.

29
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:31,590
On June 12th this priest was
assigned to Cheddar Village.

30
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,730
One month later, people in the
village started to disappear.

31
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,660
The local police department
conducted the investigation.

32
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,560
They went to the church to arrest
him the day before yesterday.

33
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,730
However, all of them were killed.

34
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,040
The London Police Department
ordered D-11 to go into action.

35
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,720
Our elite D-11 unit sent
in one division...

36
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,090
but they lost half their men
in yesterday's action.

37
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,690
What's worse, the attackers were
identified as the local policemen...

38
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,160
who were presumed dead.

39
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,830
They're not human.

40
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,760
What?

41
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,330
The vampire sucked their blood.
He used them as food.

42
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,100
They became cannibalistic
monsters, ghouls.

43
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,860
I'm sure you've attended the lecture.

44
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,730
But to say they're not human...

45
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,810
Lieutenant, I don't have the right, nor
the intention to point out your mistake.

46
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,940
My mistake...?

47
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,440
What happened in Cheddar Village...

48
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,040
You, a lieutenant in the
London Police Department...

49
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,720
should have had the
knowledge to understand...

50
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,480
and determine what would be the
wisest way to handle the situation.

51
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,430
Yet it seems you intentionally forgot...

52
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,830
that there is only one way
to resolve this sort of thing.

53
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,630
You should have known
what the result would be...

54
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,990
even if you tried to take
care of it with your elite unit.

55
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,570
I haven't forgotten about
The Royal Order of Religious Knights...

56
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,940
the Hellsing Organization.

57
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,810
Night is falling...

58
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,450
Sir Integra Hellsing...

59
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,220
My organization has
already arrived in Cheddar.

60
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,820
How many divisions did you send?

61
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,360
One person.

62
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,560
One person?!

63
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,140
A great night...

64
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:43,410
The kind of night that makes
me want to drink blood.

65
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,510
Seras...

66
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,000
Jack, please don't try to talk!

67
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,840
Reinforcements will be arriving soon!

68
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,750
I wasn't expecting anything like this!

69
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,620
I don't like this.

70
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,060
I wanted to be strong...

71
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,120
so you and everyone else
would stop calling me little kitty.

72
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:30,660
I swore I would never cry
at a crime scene.

73
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,030
Jack!!

74
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,730
Jack!!

75
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,650
Jack! Stop!

76
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,290
That's enough!

77
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,560
Everybody's coming back...

78
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,960
Dead?!

79
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,670
They're all dead!

80
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:07,300
Andy... Eugene... hey!
It's me! Little kitty!

81
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,870
Can't you tell?

82
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,820
I am on my way to Cheddar now.

83
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:30,030
The hunter I sent is perfectly
suited to this type of situation.

84
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,860
You can leave everything
in our capable hands.

85
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,540
I didn't...

86
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,860
I didn't join D-11 to do this.

87
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,390
They're not human.

88
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,530
Not human...

89
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,910
Huh?!

90
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,740
It's a great night.
Isn't it, police girl?

91
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,280
This is the kind of night that makes
me feel like sucking blood.

92
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,950
You're not... human!

93
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,860
So, you shoot because I'm not human?

94
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,520
What am I doing?

95
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,790
Where am I trying to
escape to in this place?

96
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:18,430
The church always opens its doors
to people in distress.

97
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,970
Father...

98
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,110
You are still a young lady.
So fresh and full of life.

99
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,910
But the undead from
hell have frightened you.

100
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,720
Poor girl!

101
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,680
Are you... the priest?

102
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:43,480
I'm merely a person who
gives guidance to the weak.

103
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,460
I am on a mission...

104
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,720
and the most likely
suspect would be...

105
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,290
But you're normal.

106
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,230
You're referring to those ghouls
you encountered outside.

107
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,730
Ghouls?

108
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,580
Their blood was food
for the vampire.

109
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,410
They are just animated corpses,
who exist only to serve vampires.

110
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,940
Vampire?

111
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:16,880
That's right.
Vampires don't embrace every human.

112
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,390
For example...

113
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,600
Let me go.

114
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,770
I would never make you a ghoul.

115
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:37,170
Coursing through your body is
warm blood that's unbelievably sweet.

116
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,510
You... I'll shoot you.

117
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:50,750
I'll blow your brains out,
then tell everyone...

118
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,020
I know you're feeling pain...

119
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,350
but I will give you pleasure
that lasts forever.

120
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,400
That's enough!

121
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,210
Punk!

122
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,840
Who are you?!

123
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,480
My name is Arucard.

124
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,080
I'm merely a tool of the
special operations agency, Hellsing.

125
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,110
I dispose of garbage.

126
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,190
Garbage? Hah!

127
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,850
Special operations agency?!
Have you lost your mind?

128
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,220
No, you're the maggot
underneath the garbage!

129
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,530
Look at you!

130
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,140
That cheap outfit
isn't even fit for a carnival.

131
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,270
What do you think you're doing?

132
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,510
Wearing a priest outfit, you don't
even know the meaning of shame.

133
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,410
That's what makes you trash!

134
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,910
You can die now!

135
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,750
Commander...

136
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,790
You're a narrow-minded king...

137
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,730
who creates a host
of ghouls to keep as slaves.

138
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,190
You're a coward incapable
of acting on your own.

139
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,960
Even Hell wouldn't accept you!

140
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,200
Kill him!

141
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,620
He was all talk!

142
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,450
What?!

143
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,520
It can't be!

144
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,520
Guns are useless against me!

145
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,630
You're a...?

146
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,630
Ordinary guns that is...

147
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,360
Damn ghouls! Kill him already!

148
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,010
He's not human...

149
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:33,980
Why?!

150
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,350
Why are you...?!

151
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,050
We're both vampires!

152
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,820
You instant vampires are cockroaches!

153
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,990
Multiplying everywhere
before you know it.

154
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,760
I can't stand your kind...

155
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,440
half-ass vampire without the
slightest bit of self-respect!

156
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,330
You don't even know what you are!

157
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,510
By the way...

158
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,340
I have my reasons for serving humans.

159
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,680
But of course, it's not
a story for trash like you.

160
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,650
A silver-cross from the
Great Lanchester Church...

161
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,750
was melted down to cast...

162
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,290
the 13mm explosive rounds in this gun.

163
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,020
So relax. And go to Hell, forever!

164
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,860
She's the only surviving human.

165
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,030
I know you can't shoot her.
You're a servant of the humans.

166
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,310
Say, aren't we both vampires?

167
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,680
Humans are just lower creatures.
Inferior to us in every way.

168
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,220
Yes...

169
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,750
you should help me escape.

170
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,380
Come with me! If we work together...

171
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,420
Police girl.

172
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,190
Yes...

173
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,520
Listen to me! Are you listening to me?!

174
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,720
I'm going to shoot you in the lung...

175
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,240
the bullet will pass through you to hit
that trash vampire in the heart!

176
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,100
W... wait a minute!

177
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,740
You don't want to die now?

178
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,640
Do you want to come with me?

179
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,710
Look, you...

180
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:14,380
I won't force you. The choice is yours.

181
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,580
Answer!

182
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,160
Yes.

183
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,130
Arucard...

184
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,300
You chose this, police girl.

185
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,850
One normally closes one's eyes.

186
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,600
Mission completed.

187
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,900
All target activity has ceased.

188
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,860
The limited power release is completed.

189
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,870
You spent too much time
for just one target.

190
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,710
I'll call for rescue.

191
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,380
No.

192
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,220
I want you to transfer this police girl
to the Hellsing Organization.

193
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,260
You don't make decisions.

194
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,290
This police girl made
the choice for herself.

195
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,430
It's time for the Hellsing Organization
to withdraw.

196
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,920
Excuse me...

197
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,840
This was a great night...

198
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,520
wasn't it?
