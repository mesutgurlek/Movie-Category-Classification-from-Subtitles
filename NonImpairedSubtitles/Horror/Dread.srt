1
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:57,699
Maybe I'm not being clear enough.

2
00:00:59,804 --> 00:01:03,570
Maybe I need to be honest with you
and tell you what I want.

3
00:01:05,976 --> 00:01:07,967
What is it that you want?

4
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:13,642
I want your soul to open up for me.

5
00:01:31,502 --> 00:01:36,769
Frustration or unhappiness are caused by
the unrealized potential in a person.

6
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:41,043
Cyrenaic hedonism
supported immediate gratification.

7
00:01:41,112 --> 00:01:47,381
Even fleeting desires were encouraged
regardless of the pain or expense to others.

8
00:01:58,095 --> 00:02:01,462
- Can I bum a cigarette?
- Yeah.

9
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:20,775
I don't see you
in any of the other philosophy lectures.

10
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:24,116
Ethics fulfills one of my requirements.
I'm actually a filmmaker.

11
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:28,820
Are you the real deal or someone
who thinks he's the next Scorsese

12
00:02:28,893 --> 00:02:31,885
because he spent his Friday nights
at the multiplex instead of getting laid?

13
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:36,188
I'm definitely not the next Scorsese,

14
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:38,201
and I wasn't getting laid on Friday nights

15
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:42,035
for reasons far more humiliating
than being at the movies.

16
00:02:45,943 --> 00:02:48,138
- Quaid.
- Stephen Grace.

17
00:02:52,816 --> 00:02:54,647
- Hey.
- Hey.

18
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:07,156
The philosophy major here is shit anyways.

19
00:03:07,231 --> 00:03:11,668
What we should be doing is flirting with
the subject of any worthwhile philosophy.

20
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:15,136
You know, the things we don't understand,
the things we fear,

21
00:03:15,206 --> 00:03:17,731
because if we don't, then we risk...

22
00:03:19,276 --> 00:03:20,834
Doesn't matter.

23
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:23,269
We risk what?

24
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:26,648
If you don't go out and find the beast,

25
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:29,686
sooner or later,
the beast will come and find you.

26
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:35,581
Well, I really don't think
I have fears that justify a two-hour lecture.

27
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:40,259
No? What's the worst thing
that's ever happened to you?

28
00:03:54,278 --> 00:03:59,113
My brother, my older brother,
he died when I was 15.

29
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:02,909
How did he... How did he die?

30
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:05,518
A car accident.

31
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,657
He was drunk.

32
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:16,230
Losing an older sibling
must have given your life a sense of frailty.

33
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:22,232
Come on. No fear of your own mortality?

34
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,467
No, there's not fear.
It was anger, and it was sadness.

35
00:04:27,878 --> 00:04:31,712
Not fear. Fear would've been selfish.

36
00:04:33,384 --> 00:04:37,582
I'm telling you, I lead a pretty dull life.

37
00:04:39,223 --> 00:04:42,090
Fear doesn't cross my path very often.

38
00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:46,061
- Okay, I'll drop it.
- Thank you.

39
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:51,996
That's me missing my train.

40
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:55,835
That's like the 10th time
that alarm's gone off since I've met you.

41
00:04:55,906 --> 00:04:59,706
- I'm just being practical. I...
- Maybe you're afraid to live.

42
00:05:27,404 --> 00:05:28,803
Hey, wake up, honey. We're home.

43
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:31,233
You tired, baby?

44
00:05:32,476 --> 00:05:35,036
What storybook do you want tonight?

45
00:05:52,429 --> 00:05:53,953
Can I help you?

46
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:58,735
I was in an accident,
and I need to use your phone.

47
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:03,972
I'm sorry. My phone is not working.
You'll have to go somewhere else.

48
00:06:09,713 --> 00:06:13,240
Sarah! Sarah! Get out of the house!

49
00:06:16,587 --> 00:06:17,645
Please!

50
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:11,335
Mama.

51
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:17,508
This is your mother,

52
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:22,285
your father.

53
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,444
- Hey.
- Hey.

54
00:07:49,646 --> 00:07:51,409
I didn't sleep well.

55
00:07:52,015 --> 00:07:53,710
Calculus or ethics?

56
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:57,184
I went out.

57
00:07:58,255 --> 00:08:01,622
- You don't go out when I ask.
- I didn't plan it.

58
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:03,990
Just... Just kind of happened.

59
00:08:13,403 --> 00:08:16,702
Stephen, there's a police officer here.

60
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:21,737
He asked me if I knew
where you were last night.

61
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:34,314
- So much for the golden future, son.
- That's funny.

62
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:37,751
What are you doing here?

63
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:39,693
I want you to come by my place tonight.

64
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:41,526
- Is that everything?
- Yeah.

65
00:08:41,632 --> 00:08:43,065
For what?

66
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:45,761
I want to talk to you about something.
Proposition.

67
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:50,399
- What, why don't you just tell me now?
- No, I can't. I gotta go.

68
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:55,411
Come after work. 64 Pilgrim Street.

69
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:58,205
- Change.
- Thanks.

70
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:00,776
Nice to meet you.

71
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:04,212
Cool birthmark, by the way.

72
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,967
That's it for today.

73
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,959
It's good.

74
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,163
The painting? It's a hobby.

75
00:10:57,501 --> 00:10:59,059
- You have any others?
- No.

76
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,563
I trash them when I'm done.

77
00:11:03,206 --> 00:11:05,640
I can't stand all these eyes staring at me.

78
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:07,233
Let me change.

79
00:11:19,456 --> 00:11:22,186
So... So, I've been thinking
about something.

80
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:25,258
So, you've heard of Kinsey, right?

81
00:11:26,463 --> 00:11:27,589
Yeah.

82
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:32,898
- The guy who did the sex studies.
- Yeah. What if we did a fear study?

83
00:11:32,969 --> 00:11:36,496
Compile a survey on people's fears
and what causes them.

84
00:11:37,074 --> 00:11:39,907
You have access to equipment
through the film program, right?

85
00:11:40,343 --> 00:11:43,574
- And you need a project for your thesis.
- Yeah.

86
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:46,647
Call it an experiment in catharsis.

87
00:11:46,717 --> 00:11:50,710
To live another's dread vicariously,
that's the...

88
00:11:51,088 --> 00:11:53,249
That's the safest way to touch the beast.

89
00:11:54,024 --> 00:11:59,394
Yeah. See, I don't think I really want to
touch the beast that you're talking about.

90
00:11:59,763 --> 00:12:01,754
Well, then, let's just do it

91
00:12:01,832 --> 00:12:05,893
because it will be fucking fun
to do something worthwhile.

92
00:12:07,838 --> 00:12:09,965
Well, since you put it that way.

93
00:12:12,175 --> 00:12:17,374
Yeah, that summer my brother died
he bought this old beater of a car.

94
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:19,104
It was really cool, though.

95
00:12:19,182 --> 00:12:25,280
It was a 1965, eye-shadow blue Mustang.

96
00:12:26,823 --> 00:12:29,621
We drove around all summer in that thing.

97
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,531
I didn't want to admit it that night,
but you're right.

98
00:12:40,036 --> 00:12:43,199
When my brother died,
the first thought that came to mind

99
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:46,401
was that I could've easily been
in the car with him,

100
00:12:52,382 --> 00:12:57,319
that at 15 I could've died.

101
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:03,125
So, you're in?

102
00:13:04,594 --> 00:13:06,562
Yeah. I'm in.

103
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:10,691
Good. Let's celebrate.

104
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,405
- Hey, this is Samantha.
- Hi.

105
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:18,839
- And this is Zooey, right?
- Yeah.

106
00:13:20,043 --> 00:13:22,807
It's a really cool name.
Have you ever seen the film Killing Zoe?

107
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,005
What?

108
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:27,412
I said I like your name.

109
00:14:35,318 --> 00:14:36,580
You shit.

110
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:40,254
Don't we use computers for that now?

111
00:14:40,323 --> 00:14:44,384
Don't you know only pricks and terrorists
wear sunglasses indoors?

112
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:54,232
So, I need an editor for my thesis.

113
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:59,839
- What do you think about partnering?
- What would be the topic?

114
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,038
Dread.

115
00:15:03,647 --> 00:15:05,342
We're gonna chase the beast,

116
00:15:05,415 --> 00:15:08,475
discover the origins
of people's deepest fears.

117
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:12,653
Reveal the dark behind the door.

118
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:17,150
Okay, I'm in.

119
00:15:43,453 --> 00:15:45,216
How old were you
when you had your first nightmare?

120
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:47,483
The first nightmare I really remember...

121
00:15:48,124 --> 00:15:52,151
I hate moisture.
The worst is when you spill a drink

122
00:15:52,228 --> 00:15:56,722
and your napkin gets all wet
like a fleshy mass.

123
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,233
- Have you ever been mugged?
- Do you believe in the devil?

124
00:15:59,336 --> 00:16:01,133
Have you ever been harmed
by a family member?

125
00:16:01,204 --> 00:16:02,967
Have you ever seen a person die?

126
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,132
What's your strongest memory
of feeling fear?

127
00:16:09,913 --> 00:16:11,005
Fuck. Fuck.

128
00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:17,312
- At first it started like a fungus...
- I don't believe in anything.

129
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:20,151
...but then there was this discharge.

130
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,555
God is man, and man thinks he's God.

131
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:27,426
When my baby sister was born, my
mother's vagina ripped, like, three inches.

132
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:30,166
They had to sew her up with frigging twine.

133
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:35,994
I was 10.
On that day, I vowed to never have kids.

134
00:16:37,273 --> 00:16:38,297
Can we stop?

135
00:16:39,442 --> 00:16:42,934
It turned out there was a worm,
and it had crawled up there

136
00:16:43,013 --> 00:16:46,847
when I was swimming in the lake
by my grandparents' house.

137
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:51,250
And my pubes,
they started to grow this cheese.

138
00:16:55,358 --> 00:16:57,849
I think we have everything we need.

139
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:07,364
You know we've had
five classes together. Five.

140
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:10,934
And this is the first meal we've ever shared.

141
00:17:11,007 --> 00:17:15,376
Well, it's not really a meal.
That's more like a botanical garden.

142
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:20,849
I'm sorry if I offend you with my roughage,
Mr. Triple Bypass.

143
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:25,053
- So good.
- I just don't like meat.

144
00:17:29,225 --> 00:17:30,624
Your burger

145
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:33,828
makes me want to vomit.

146
00:17:35,331 --> 00:17:37,492
Gross. That's lovely.

147
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:42,231
First meal. Two years.

148
00:17:47,877 --> 00:17:52,610
To be honest, you know, you're probably
one of the people I talk to the most.

149
00:17:55,185 --> 00:17:57,585
Wow. You're such a loser.

150
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:09,162
What's up?

151
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,097
It's not good enough.

152
00:18:13,203 --> 00:18:14,397
It's a start.

153
00:18:14,471 --> 00:18:16,769
But, "I'm scared of spiders,"
"I'm scared of clowns,"

154
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,740
"I'm scared of Mickey fucking Mouse. "
Who cares?

155
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:20,002
Relax.

156
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,811
I don't believe in anything.
What is there to believe in?

157
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,281
Do you set that thing
to tell you when to take a shit?

158
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:31,679
- Give me the fucking thing.
- No.

159
00:18:31,754 --> 00:18:33,688
...been like ghosts.

160
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:36,281
Give me the fucking watch, Stephen.

161
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,252
- I'm not...
- Give me the watch.

162
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:41,627
- Hey, hey! Wait.
- God. What up, you two? Come on.

163
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:50,969
You fucking asshole.

164
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:52,933
Stop!

165
00:18:57,147 --> 00:18:58,614
Interview me.

166
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:02,978
What?

167
00:19:05,188 --> 00:19:06,678
I want to sit.

168
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,290
I grew up in a small town
in upstate New York.

169
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:20,996
My mom worked at the local supermarket,

170
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:23,038
and my dad...

171
00:19:25,108 --> 00:19:27,338
And my dad worked at the...

172
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:31,039
At a meat-packing plant
about 20 miles outside of town.

173
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,483
They'd slaughter cattle there

174
00:19:36,553 --> 00:19:41,650
and supply our markets
with corn-fed organic beef.

175
00:19:43,459 --> 00:19:45,120
And he'd work late.

176
00:19:46,296 --> 00:19:50,926
And by the time he'd get home,
my mom would always be asleep.

177
00:19:51,734 --> 00:19:55,135
I'd lay there on my pillow

178
00:19:58,942 --> 00:20:03,606
and listen to the sound of his boots
walk to my bedroom door.

179
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:09,113
I don't know if my mother

180
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:12,120
just pretended not to know
what the fuck was going on

181
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:15,749
or if she was just too weak.

182
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:18,190
You don't... You don't need to do this.

183
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:20,862
But...

184
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:26,467
What I remember the most about it
was the way...

185
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:34,108
The way his flesh smelled
when he'd come home from work.

186
00:20:34,177 --> 00:20:39,479
This heavy, metallic smell

187
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:44,384
that would follow him home from the plant,

188
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:50,557
like warm blood on the grass,

189
00:20:54,097 --> 00:20:56,258
cold fat in the freezers.

190
00:21:03,673 --> 00:21:06,904
I can hardly stand to look
at a piece of meat now,

191
00:21:07,443 --> 00:21:09,843
let alone think about eating it.

192
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:17,776
Looks like I'll be taking iron supplements
for the rest of my life, huh?

193
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:22,987
That's what I'm talking about,
some fucking, honest-to-God trauma!

194
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,194
Yeah? I showed you mine,
now you show me yours.

195
00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:40,467
Come on, Quaid.
How'd your parents fuck you up?

196
00:21:48,351 --> 00:21:49,443
I just don't want...

197
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:51,346
Hey. I'm gonna go ahead and stay the night.

198
00:22:51,414 --> 00:22:53,939
I've already missed the last train.

199
00:24:41,591 --> 00:24:44,151
Wake up. Stephen, he's in the house!

200
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,788
Quaid, Quaid, Quaid, what is it?
What is it? You okay?

201
00:24:52,835 --> 00:24:54,462
Hey, what is it?

202
00:24:59,942 --> 00:25:01,466
Just a dream.

203
00:25:05,348 --> 00:25:06,872
That didn't sound like just a dream.

204
00:25:06,949 --> 00:25:10,646
No, it was nothing. Just go back to bed.

205
00:25:12,088 --> 00:25:13,180
No.

206
00:25:15,491 --> 00:25:18,324
You practically know my whole life story.

207
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:23,023
Yeah, but when it comes to you,
I don't know much at all.

208
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:46,047
My parents were killed
when I was six years old, Stephen.

209
00:25:47,623 --> 00:25:51,491
They were murdered
right in front of my eyes.

210
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:57,058
Killed with the axe
from my father's tool shed.

211
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,904
Never caught the man that did it.

212
00:26:09,612 --> 00:26:15,278
I don't know how I got away, but I did.
I ran and I ran,

213
00:26:20,256 --> 00:26:22,520
and I've never really stopped.

214
00:26:23,993 --> 00:26:26,120
Don't tell anyone, Stephen.

215
00:26:28,831 --> 00:26:31,493
- Promise me.
- I promise.

216
00:26:53,222 --> 00:26:55,019
Well, hello, creepy.

217
00:26:57,126 --> 00:26:59,924
Quaid came in looking for you yesterday.

218
00:27:00,196 --> 00:27:02,756
- Yeah, what'd he want?
- Don't know.

219
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:07,896
But he asked me if I'd model for him.

220
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:12,604
- What did you say?
- I said, "Fuck, no. "

221
00:27:14,276 --> 00:27:16,107
Politely, of course.

222
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:19,380
But for a while,
I thought he might actually convince me.

223
00:27:19,448 --> 00:27:21,916
- Can I pay for this?
- Yeah, sorry.

224
00:27:31,794 --> 00:27:34,160
- Hey.
- What's this?

225
00:27:35,564 --> 00:27:37,088
It's therapy.

226
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:41,660
1,200 bucks on Craigslist.

227
00:27:52,114 --> 00:27:56,574
- Why do you have this?
- You know why I got it. It's for you.

228
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:02,581
Find the beast. Drive it when you're ready,
not a moment sooner.

229
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:06,125
Come up. I think we got a good one today.

230
00:28:08,531 --> 00:28:13,400
Joshua, what is your strongest memory
of feeling fear?

231
00:28:14,403 --> 00:28:17,930
When I was six years old, I was hit by a car,

232
00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:24,379
and the concussion left me deaf
for three years.

233
00:28:26,615 --> 00:28:29,140
So, I went from being, you know,

234
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,919
a normal kid
to being completely cut off from the world.

235
00:28:37,727 --> 00:28:42,790
When it got really bad, I had a prayer.
My mom taught it to me.

236
00:28:43,232 --> 00:28:47,134
It's, "Gentle Jesus... "

237
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:50,496
Something...

238
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:53,764
"Look upon this little child and... "

239
00:28:53,843 --> 00:28:57,609
You know, it was...
It was that sort of thing, you know.

240
00:28:59,148 --> 00:29:02,777
I can't remember it anymore.
Haven't needed it in a while.

241
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:07,778
Then one day, my hearing came back.

242
00:29:08,557 --> 00:29:11,856
I mean, you know, I... Still, you know,

243
00:29:11,927 --> 00:29:18,765
I hear any volume of sound,
and the ringing comes back, and...

244
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:24,001
Even talking about it,

245
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:27,766
you know, it brings back

246
00:29:29,145 --> 00:29:31,909
a feeling of dread.

247
00:29:36,385 --> 00:29:39,684
I mean,
I suppose that is the worst part of it all.

248
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:41,879
You live with the notion

249
00:29:41,957 --> 00:29:46,155
that the thing that causes you
the most terror

250
00:29:47,229 --> 00:29:49,754
could come back at any time.

251
00:30:32,107 --> 00:30:33,404
Yeah? Hi.

252
00:30:34,176 --> 00:30:35,473
This way.

253
00:30:43,953 --> 00:30:48,652
Hey. Will you sit for me tomorrow?
Same price as usual.

254
00:30:49,258 --> 00:30:51,055
I can't. I have plans.

255
00:30:52,194 --> 00:30:54,560
Just ask one of the other girls.

256
00:32:00,896 --> 00:32:03,126
This is your mother.

257
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,369
Your mother.

258
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:41,031
So, I have a surprise for you.

259
00:32:41,537 --> 00:32:43,835
- A gift?
- A necessity.

260
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:53,739
- Awesome.
- It's virtually indestructible.

261
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:58,246
At least shatter-resistant
and possibly waterproof.

262
00:33:00,656 --> 00:33:02,351
Thank you, Cheryl.

263
00:33:05,594 --> 00:33:07,323
So, I was thinking

264
00:33:07,396 --> 00:33:11,628
that if you ever wanted me to interview
for the fear study, I could.

265
00:33:12,334 --> 00:33:14,461
Yeah? Okay.

266
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:19,439
I'll talk to the guys,
and we can set something up.

267
00:33:19,675 --> 00:33:23,668
I was kind of hoping you would just do it.

268
00:33:23,812 --> 00:33:26,838
- I'd feel more comfortable.
- Sure.

269
00:33:29,351 --> 00:33:33,310
- I can come by tonight after class.
- Great.

270
00:33:39,762 --> 00:33:41,957
- Is this your family?
- Yeah.

271
00:33:42,765 --> 00:33:45,199
My mom and my two older sisters.

272
00:33:45,434 --> 00:33:48,369
- They're pretty, huh?
- Yeah, they're pretty,

273
00:33:49,238 --> 00:33:50,762
just like their sister.

274
00:34:00,182 --> 00:34:02,082
Should we get started?

275
00:34:06,155 --> 00:34:10,057
You know, I can vividly remember
my first day at kindergarten.

276
00:34:10,793 --> 00:34:13,261
I was wearing a light blue dress,

277
00:34:14,563 --> 00:34:16,997
and I was there no more than 10 minutes

278
00:34:17,066 --> 00:34:20,467
before some boy asked me
what was wrong with my face.

279
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:26,965
That was the first time I realized
I had something to be ashamed of.

280
00:34:27,042 --> 00:34:29,533
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

281
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:33,774
Stephen, you're supposed
to be impartial, remember?

282
00:34:35,818 --> 00:34:36,807
Yeah.

283
00:34:39,221 --> 00:34:42,657
Listen, I could have a lot worse
than a birthmark covering my body.

284
00:34:46,195 --> 00:34:51,223
But that's kind of hard to swallow whenever
I have to look in the mirror to fix my hair.

285
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:54,932
Or when I look at my sisters.

286
00:34:57,072 --> 00:34:59,700
What that boy asked me
when I was five years old

287
00:34:59,775 --> 00:35:03,006
is what people want to ask me
every day of my life.

288
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:09,215
And every time I have to meet someone
for the first time,

289
00:35:09,284 --> 00:35:12,310
I'll always be that 5-year-old girl again.

290
00:35:18,961 --> 00:35:21,987
I'm so sorry
you have to go through that, Abby.

291
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:32,264
Can I show you something?

292
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:36,269
Something that it takes a lot for me to do.

293
00:35:37,946 --> 00:35:40,710
Something that I don't show many people.

294
00:36:45,714 --> 00:36:46,840
Abby.

295
00:36:54,356 --> 00:36:57,814
Abby, I can't.

296
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:00,787
Why?

297
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,668
My heart is somewhere else right now.

298
00:37:12,307 --> 00:37:14,400
What does that even mean?

299
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:18,105
Abby.

300
00:37:20,983 --> 00:37:22,245
Just go.

301
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:24,476
- Abby...
- Please, just go.

302
00:37:36,265 --> 00:37:40,429
Will you just go pick up the camera?
You don't need to talk to her.

303
00:37:44,106 --> 00:37:48,566
- Why didn't you just fuck her?
- Because I don't feel that way about her.

304
00:37:49,177 --> 00:37:51,702
You're afraid Cheryl will find out.

305
00:37:52,514 --> 00:37:56,610
- That has nothing to do with it.
- So, I can show her the tape, huh?

306
00:38:00,389 --> 00:38:02,550
Can you just cut me a break?

307
00:38:05,093 --> 00:38:06,253
Look,

308
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:13,559
Cheryl carries a lot of baggage,
and I don't wanna see you get hurt,

309
00:38:16,972 --> 00:38:19,668
not to mention I don't like you
pissing in the well, but...

310
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:24,075
Quaid, it's a school project, okay?
It's not like we're curing cancer.

311
00:38:29,451 --> 00:38:32,909
Is that all this is to you, Stephen,
a school project?

312
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,555
You know what I mean.

313
00:38:47,135 --> 00:38:49,433
- We're friends, right?
- Right.

314
00:38:49,938 --> 00:38:52,839
Right, so, of course I'm going to help you.

315
00:38:54,643 --> 00:38:57,373
I'll get the camera, I'll toss the tape,

316
00:38:57,446 --> 00:39:00,210
- after I've watched it.
- Thank you.

317
00:39:00,816 --> 00:39:03,512
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

318
00:39:05,587 --> 00:39:09,683
- I'm taking the car tomorrow.
- Good for you.

319
00:39:12,127 --> 00:39:16,894
Look, I know you thought it was gonna be
some great cathartic challenge for me,

320
00:39:16,965 --> 00:39:19,331
but it is just a car, Quaid.

321
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,865
Yeah, I know. It's just a car,

322
00:39:27,008 --> 00:39:29,602
when you're trying
to get into a girl's pants.

323
00:39:29,678 --> 00:39:31,339
Shut the fuck up.

324
00:40:01,376 --> 00:40:04,903
- Do you want the tape?
- No.

325
00:40:13,388 --> 00:40:16,789
- You are sexy, you know.
- No, I'm not.

326
00:40:21,062 --> 00:40:22,188
Why?

327
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:30,131
Sexy is all kinds of things. It's...

328
00:40:31,573 --> 00:40:33,973
It's short dress and high heels.

329
00:40:35,377 --> 00:40:38,835
It's... It's morning breath and messy hair.

330
00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:45,918
It's covered in dirt
from cleaning out the garage all day. It's...

331
00:40:47,456 --> 00:40:50,721
It's a winter coat
that hides everything but this.

332
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,818
Sexy is unique.

333
00:41:02,737 --> 00:41:03,795
So,

334
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:10,344
you wanna stop feeling sorry for yourself?

335
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,461
Will you paint me?
Will you paint me normal?

336
00:41:59,494 --> 00:42:00,586
Hey.

337
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,663
- You're a fucking psycho.
- No, you!

338
00:43:01,089 --> 00:43:04,058
Go down on me. Please.

339
00:43:48,403 --> 00:43:51,133
What's wrong? Did you have a nightmare?

340
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,236
What is your strongest memory
of feeling fear?

341
00:44:00,148 --> 00:44:02,082
My life is a labyrinth.

342
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:10,014
A map of its complexities is etched
on my face in 1,000 tiny expressions.

343
00:44:11,326 --> 00:44:12,520
Waking up at night...

344
00:44:13,361 --> 00:44:14,726
Thank you.

345
00:44:15,463 --> 00:44:17,727
What's your strongest memory?

346
00:44:18,466 --> 00:44:21,162
There is an answer in what we're doing,

347
00:44:21,569 --> 00:44:25,232
a remedy that no fucking medication

348
00:44:25,306 --> 00:44:29,436
or quack therapy could ever compete with.

349
00:44:30,912 --> 00:44:33,142
Potentially losing my mother.

350
00:44:34,783 --> 00:44:36,444
Sometimes I get discouraged.

351
00:44:36,518 --> 00:44:38,611
- That's bad.
- See, everybody's like that.

352
00:44:39,821 --> 00:44:42,289
Maybe I'm not being clear enough.

353
00:44:44,292 --> 00:44:48,285
Maybe I need to be honest with you
and tell you what I want.

354
00:44:50,465 --> 00:44:52,524
What is it that you want?

355
00:44:56,004 --> 00:44:58,666
I want your soul to open up for me.

356
00:45:01,142 --> 00:45:06,045
Spread-eagled like a split beaver
so that I can gaze into its secrets.

357
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,668
Last one. I got some beer and shit,

358
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,573
but we really gotta cram the night
if we wanna get everything done.

359
00:45:34,642 --> 00:45:36,803
- How many did you get?
- Six-pack.

360
00:45:36,878 --> 00:45:40,245
You can't really have one.
They're all six for me.

361
00:45:40,315 --> 00:45:42,408
Come on, give me a beer.

362
00:45:42,484 --> 00:45:44,816
I'll be downstairs.
I'm gonna get set up, all right?

363
00:45:49,758 --> 00:45:53,455
I was confined to a house
for the better part of 20 years.

364
00:45:53,762 --> 00:45:55,696
It was my mother's house.

365
00:45:56,297 --> 00:45:59,528
I was professionally diagnosed
with agoraphobia.

366
00:46:00,902 --> 00:46:03,462
So, you would never leave the house.

367
00:46:04,672 --> 00:46:08,472
How did you do anything
like get food or toilet paper?

368
00:46:09,177 --> 00:46:12,203
Well, I was completely dependent
on my mother,

369
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,105
and I had developed a severe hatred for her.

370
00:46:17,185 --> 00:46:20,552
She was the cause
of everything horrible in my life,

371
00:46:22,423 --> 00:46:24,323
but she was my only friend.

372
00:46:27,929 --> 00:46:31,524
She died when I was 21. Heart attack.

373
00:46:34,369 --> 00:46:36,166
I never told anyone.

374
00:46:37,338 --> 00:46:40,739
I didn't call anyone. I never had. I couldn't.

375
00:46:42,677 --> 00:46:46,272
About three weeks later,
the neighbors noticed the smell, I guess,

376
00:46:46,347 --> 00:46:49,282
and they came over
and called an ambulance.

377
00:46:49,551 --> 00:46:53,146
After that, they came
and checked on me quite frequently.

378
00:46:53,221 --> 00:46:54,210
It's a good thing they did, too,

379
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:58,350
because the day I tried to commit suicide
they found me.

380
00:47:03,064 --> 00:47:05,555
Would you mind talking about that?

381
00:47:14,742 --> 00:47:17,006
I cut my throat with a razor.

382
00:47:22,584 --> 00:47:24,745
I was dead for five minutes.

383
00:47:29,257 --> 00:47:31,088
But that's why I'm here.

384
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,925
Three years ago,
I could not step out of my house.

385
00:47:38,499 --> 00:47:42,731
And now the world is at my feet,
and it's because when I came back,

386
00:47:45,073 --> 00:47:47,439
I came back completely fearless.

387
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:49,836
You're a fucking liar.

388
00:47:49,911 --> 00:47:51,173
- Quaid.
- Excuse me?

389
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:55,046
You don't come in here and lie to me
and tell me you're fucking fearless!

390
00:47:55,116 --> 00:47:56,743
- Quaid, stop!
- Hey, what are you doing?

391
00:47:56,818 --> 00:47:58,376
- Quaid!
- Quaid, what the fuck?

392
00:47:58,453 --> 00:48:01,513
- Get off of me.
- It's fucking makeup.

393
00:48:06,728 --> 00:48:07,990
You asshole.

394
00:48:10,231 --> 00:48:11,357
I thought it'd be good for my reel.

395
00:48:11,432 --> 00:48:14,128
This isn't reality television!
Get the fuck out of here!

396
00:48:14,202 --> 00:48:15,464
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

397
00:48:15,536 --> 00:48:16,867
Fuck you!

398
00:48:25,513 --> 00:48:28,175
Have you completely lost
your fucking mind?

399
00:48:28,249 --> 00:48:31,013
You can't just attack someone like that.

400
00:48:31,886 --> 00:48:35,083
- I was right, wasn't I?
- Who cares?

401
00:48:37,191 --> 00:48:38,920
What's it to us?

402
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,152
I don't feel like getting arrested for assault.

403
00:48:43,264 --> 00:48:44,595
"Who cares?"

404
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:47,966
"Who cares?"

405
00:48:48,536 --> 00:48:53,838
- This is just a school project, right?
- Yeah, exactly.

406
00:48:54,275 --> 00:48:56,766
- Quaid, what the fuck?
- Quaid!

407
00:48:56,978 --> 00:49:02,644
This was never about a school assignment!
I could give a fuck about your thesis!

408
00:49:10,058 --> 00:49:12,185
Quaid. Quaid, please stop.

409
00:49:14,929 --> 00:49:16,328
No. No!

410
00:49:17,598 --> 00:49:20,362
No! No! No!

411
00:49:47,395 --> 00:49:49,659
- Cheryl.
- Just leave me alone.

412
00:49:50,231 --> 00:49:51,664
Cheryl, I...

413
00:50:01,075 --> 00:50:04,010
Did you ever fuck her or what, huh?

414
00:50:06,214 --> 00:50:07,647
What does she sound like
when she comes?

415
00:50:07,715 --> 00:50:10,946
- That's enough.
- She's a quiet one, I bet.

416
00:50:11,753 --> 00:50:14,221
Lets it build up in her cunt.

417
00:50:15,356 --> 00:50:17,153
What you just did...

418
00:50:17,658 --> 00:50:20,422
See, you don't even give a shit!

419
00:50:24,198 --> 00:50:27,690
It's a good thing
I didn't try to take your watch.

420
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,131
Hey, Cheryl. This is Stephen.

421
00:51:08,209 --> 00:51:10,336
Look, I'll pay for the damaged equipment.

422
00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:12,974
Just call me back.

423
00:51:27,762 --> 00:51:32,495
Good job, Grace. Fucking B+.
Kessler kicked my ass.

424
00:51:33,167 --> 00:51:37,160
- What do you... What do you mean?
- The grades are out, for the thesis.

425
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:06,557
Hey, I'm sorry.

426
00:52:08,035 --> 00:52:12,438
I fucked up. I'm fucked up, I know.

427
00:52:15,309 --> 00:52:17,004
Why did you turn in the film?

428
00:52:17,879 --> 00:52:19,642
I couldn't let you fail.

429
00:52:20,281 --> 00:52:25,548
I had backups on an external. It was...
It was missing the last interview, of course.

430
00:52:28,523 --> 00:52:30,013
I'll give you the money for the equipment.

431
00:52:30,091 --> 00:52:32,389
- I'll pay for everything.
- Yeah.

432
00:52:33,394 --> 00:52:35,760
- That's right. You will.
- I will.

433
00:52:38,432 --> 00:52:42,198
Now get in and let me apologize
for being such an asshole.

434
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,239
Stephen, I want us to...
I want us to finish our fear study.

435
00:53:26,981 --> 00:53:31,350
What are you talking about? It's finished.
You... You turned it in.

436
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:37,989
No, it's not about what we've already done.
It's about what we still need to do.

437
00:53:38,259 --> 00:53:42,662
Yeah, I can do this alone,
but I don't want to.

438
00:53:44,432 --> 00:53:47,333
Quaid, the assignment's done. I'm done.

439
00:53:48,302 --> 00:53:51,430
All right, if you want to continue it,
then continue it.

440
00:53:51,505 --> 00:53:53,871
The study was your idea anyway.

441
00:53:56,544 --> 00:53:58,341
So, where we going?

442
00:53:59,647 --> 00:54:01,171
To the limits.

443
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:09,688
Wow. This is some great apology.
Pull the car over.

444
00:54:09,757 --> 00:54:13,284
- Drink it.
- No, I'm not drinking it. Pull the car over.

445
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:23,269
- Okay, what is this, some sick game?
- It's not a game, Stephen, okay?

446
00:54:23,337 --> 00:54:27,068
It's life, you know.
It's you facing your fears and fucking living.

447
00:54:27,141 --> 00:54:29,200
Haven't you ever wondered
what it was like for your brother

448
00:54:29,277 --> 00:54:31,745
those final few moments
before he crashed his car?

449
00:54:31,812 --> 00:54:35,976
- Before he completely lost control?
- No, Quaid, I don't.

450
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:40,919
I avoid having to think about those
moments like any rational person would.

451
00:54:41,455 --> 00:54:44,618
What are you trying to do?
You gonna drive us into a brick wall?

452
00:54:44,692 --> 00:54:48,093
- Is that gonna teach me some life lesson?
- Hey, you never know, Stephen.

453
00:54:48,162 --> 00:54:52,394
There could be a solution
in those final moments, you know.

454
00:54:52,566 --> 00:54:55,057
A resolution. A way out.

455
00:54:56,771 --> 00:54:59,239
- A way out of what?
- Of your dread.

456
00:55:03,844 --> 00:55:05,744
Come on, let it take you, Stephen.

457
00:55:09,116 --> 00:55:11,448
- You can't always have control.
- Yes, I can!

458
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:13,453
- No, you can't!
- Pull the car over!

459
00:55:42,249 --> 00:55:44,308
Hey, Stephen, man. Come on.

460
00:55:46,487 --> 00:55:50,480
Hey, look, I'm sorry, okay? I'm... I'm drunk.

461
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:55,955
Please, come on.
Just get in and drive me home.

462
00:55:59,533 --> 00:56:00,932
Fuck off.

463
00:56:09,276 --> 00:56:12,006
I need help. Stephen, I need...

464
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:17,283
I need help.

465
00:56:37,338 --> 00:56:38,464
Shit.

466
00:59:13,093 --> 00:59:15,084
What are you doing here?

467
00:59:17,965 --> 00:59:22,561
I came to try and salvage
some of the hard drive.

468
00:59:27,074 --> 00:59:28,439
Down here?

469
00:59:31,145 --> 00:59:33,511
I was looking for a light bulb and...

470
00:59:44,024 --> 00:59:46,959
If it looks like madness, it must be, right?

471
00:59:48,062 --> 00:59:50,326
Is that what you're thinking?

472
00:59:56,937 --> 00:59:59,201
I don't know what I'm thinking.

473
01:00:05,713 --> 01:00:08,978
- I'm gonna go.
- Ask me what I want.

474
01:00:16,357 --> 01:00:17,483
No.

475
01:00:18,592 --> 01:00:22,119
Go ahead. Ask me.

476
01:00:26,133 --> 01:00:27,760
What do you want?

477
01:00:28,736 --> 01:00:31,796
I want us to take our study to the next level.

478
01:01:23,457 --> 01:01:25,550
Can you go and sign me in...

479
01:01:29,129 --> 01:01:31,393
Hey, this is Cheryl. Leave me a message.

480
01:01:31,465 --> 01:01:34,798
Hey, Cheryl. It's Stephen.

481
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:38,937
I haven't seen you in, like, a week and...

482
01:01:41,442 --> 01:01:43,239
Look, I promise
I'm not gonna complicate your life.

483
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:45,710
I just wanna talk. Okay?

484
01:01:46,246 --> 01:01:49,306
Just call me back. Bye.

485
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:08,259
- Hey.
- Hey.

486
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:12,862
I'm going home for break tomorrow,
and we didn't say goodbye.

487
01:02:15,676 --> 01:02:18,611
And I didn't want to leave things
how we left them.

488
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,493
What's this?

489
01:02:38,699 --> 01:02:40,496
...that's kind of hard to swallow whenever...

490
01:02:40,567 --> 01:02:42,034
- What's going on?
- Hey.

491
01:02:42,102 --> 01:02:45,560
This weird video started playing
on the campus channel.

492
01:02:50,444 --> 01:02:52,810
...a light blue dress,

493
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,246
and I was there no more than 10 minutes...

494
01:03:00,053 --> 01:03:02,385
This is on every TV
across campus right now.

495
01:03:02,456 --> 01:03:04,924
I'll always be that 5-year-old girl.
You know, I can vividly remember

496
01:03:04,992 --> 01:03:06,323
my first day at kindergarten.

497
01:03:06,393 --> 01:03:08,418
...covering my body.
I had something to be ashamed of.

498
01:03:08,495 --> 01:03:12,158
...every day of my life...
What was wrong with my face.

499
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,233
What was wrong with my face.
What was wrong with my face.

500
01:03:31,752 --> 01:03:33,344
- Abby.
- Hey, watch it!

501
01:03:36,623 --> 01:03:37,851
Abby?

502
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,727
Abby!

503
01:04:17,798 --> 01:04:19,231
You made it.

504
01:04:22,569 --> 01:04:24,127
- Thanks for coming.
- That's all right.

505
01:04:24,204 --> 01:04:26,069
When I... When I was reviewing your tape,

506
01:04:26,139 --> 01:04:29,597
I realized there were a few more questions
we should have asked you.

507
01:04:29,676 --> 01:04:34,113
Your interview was so compelling
I didn't wanna leave any stone unturned.

508
01:04:36,516 --> 01:04:39,781
- Stephen and Cheryl not here?
- No, they couldn't make it tonight.

509
01:04:39,853 --> 01:04:42,117
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yeah.

510
01:04:42,689 --> 01:04:44,714
- Jack and Coke?
- Sure.

511
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:05,403
- You want ice, right?
- Yeah.

512
01:05:06,446 --> 01:05:11,748
You have a really cool collection. I mean,
you have Nausea by Jean-Paul Sartre.

513
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:16,083
I've read No Exit,
but I always heard this was better.

514
01:05:27,601 --> 01:05:29,831
Good. You're awake.

515
01:05:31,038 --> 01:05:32,938
I was getting tired of waiting.

516
01:05:37,778 --> 01:05:39,405
Can you hear me?

517
01:05:42,382 --> 01:05:44,748
Can you hear me?

518
01:05:45,452 --> 01:05:47,682
What? No.

519
01:05:52,693 --> 01:05:54,957
I think you can still hear me.

520
01:05:56,997 --> 01:06:01,093
Please. Okay, you've proved your point.
I'm scared.

521
01:06:01,535 --> 01:06:03,366
I'm scared. Please.

522
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,032
Let me go.

523
01:06:10,911 --> 01:06:14,210
Take this fucking thing off my head, please.

524
01:06:15,449 --> 01:06:19,886
Well, you look like a goddamn fool.
Fucking spaceman.

525
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:25,624
I don't know what I was thinking.

526
01:06:34,868 --> 01:06:36,961
Thank you. I'm sorry.

527
01:06:44,411 --> 01:06:47,278
Fuck, no, please.

528
01:06:47,447 --> 01:06:50,439
I'm sorry. What have I done?
What have I done?

529
01:06:51,752 --> 01:06:54,152
I'm sorry. I'm... Don't shoot me.

530
01:06:56,089 --> 01:06:58,922
No. No. No!

531
01:06:59,059 --> 01:07:01,118
No! Fuck!

532
01:07:14,241 --> 01:07:15,538
Mommy!

533
01:07:20,747 --> 01:07:22,772
Mommy!

534
01:07:24,351 --> 01:07:28,310
Oh, God!

535
01:07:28,588 --> 01:07:32,115
Mommy! Mommy!

536
01:08:08,962 --> 01:08:13,490
Hey. Take solace in this.

537
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:18,232
You faced the beast. The beast won.

538
01:08:46,733 --> 01:08:50,794
- Hello?
- Stephen.

539
01:08:50,871 --> 01:08:54,830
Abby. Where are you?

540
01:08:56,276 --> 01:09:01,304
Would you like me if I was pretty?
Perfect like my sisters?

541
01:09:03,617 --> 01:09:05,744
What are you talking about?

542
01:09:06,386 --> 01:09:07,751
Abby.

543
01:09:09,689 --> 01:09:11,589
Tell me where you are.

544
01:09:12,125 --> 01:09:15,617
Where are you? Abby?

545
01:10:42,249 --> 01:10:45,116
Oh, Christ. Oh, shit.

546
01:10:47,053 --> 01:10:50,352
Abby. Abby, Abby.
Someone call an ambulance!

547
01:10:50,423 --> 01:10:54,484
Abby. Abby, Abby. Oh, my God. Abby!

548
01:10:55,328 --> 01:10:59,094
Call a fucking ambulance, somebody!
Help me!

549
01:11:02,035 --> 01:11:05,368
"Gentle Jesus, meek and mild

550
01:11:06,172 --> 01:11:10,506
"Look upon this little child
Pity my simplicity

551
01:11:11,845 --> 01:11:15,838
"Suffer me to come to thee"
That would make it all better.

552
01:11:37,570 --> 01:11:39,663
What's John Doe's story?

553
01:11:39,739 --> 01:11:42,469
Still no news from the officer
who dropped him off.

554
01:11:42,942 --> 01:11:44,967
What seems to be the problem?

555
01:11:46,012 --> 01:11:48,003
Doesn't respond to the doctors at all.

556
01:12:49,376 --> 01:12:50,502
All set.

557
01:12:52,178 --> 01:12:56,080
Joshua, what is your strongest memory
of feeling fear?

558
01:14:42,956 --> 01:14:44,287
Quaid!

559
01:14:46,259 --> 01:14:49,387
Face the beast! You did that to her!

560
01:14:50,997 --> 01:14:55,229
Come on out! Get out here!
I won't let you get away with that!

561
01:14:57,871 --> 01:14:59,736
You wanna face the beast?

562
01:15:00,473 --> 01:15:01,963
This is your mother...

563
01:15:02,041 --> 01:15:03,406
Face me!

564
01:15:04,377 --> 01:15:05,969
...and your father.

565
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:21,120
Abby's in the fucking emergency room.

566
01:15:23,997 --> 01:15:26,795
She's in the fucking emergency room,
Quaid!

567
01:15:27,467 --> 01:15:29,332
All because of you.

568
01:15:33,306 --> 01:15:36,503
Get the fuck out here! Now!

569
01:15:59,132 --> 01:16:00,759
You think you can fucking scare me, huh?

570
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:04,325
You think you can scare me, Stephen, huh?
Toss the axe!

571
01:16:06,005 --> 01:16:07,939
Down on your knees.

572
01:16:29,729 --> 01:16:30,855
Hey.

573
01:16:32,332 --> 01:16:34,596
Got something to show you.

574
01:16:34,701 --> 01:16:39,001
Results from this school project of ours.

575
01:16:40,073 --> 01:16:42,974
They've been much more rewarding
as of late.

576
01:16:45,044 --> 01:16:48,070
It's beef. Slightly salted, well-cooked.

577
01:16:49,515 --> 01:16:51,540
What the fuck did you do?

578
01:16:55,054 --> 01:16:56,248
Cheryl.

579
01:16:59,626 --> 01:17:01,184
Help!

580
01:17:03,363 --> 01:17:06,855
Cheryl! Cheryl! Cheryl!

581
01:17:06,933 --> 01:17:09,629
She's not here, Stephen.
I've already let her go.

582
01:17:09,702 --> 01:17:12,728
- I don't believe you.
- I swear she's not here.

583
01:17:12,972 --> 01:17:16,271
I just wanted you to see
the next phase of my study.

584
01:17:16,342 --> 01:17:18,970
I'm beginning to get the results I need.

585
01:17:19,045 --> 01:17:22,503
It's starting to make me feel
a little fucking better, you know?

586
01:17:22,582 --> 01:17:24,675
My nightmares have stopped cold.

587
01:17:27,387 --> 01:17:30,254
I think she believed she could outwait me.

588
01:17:33,026 --> 01:17:35,358
She hated even the smell of it.

589
01:17:36,329 --> 01:17:40,789
And all those memories of her father
are flooding back to her, I'm sure.

590
01:17:40,967 --> 01:17:42,935
Flooding back as if they were yesterday.

591
01:17:52,378 --> 01:17:54,403
How long did you keep her in there?

592
01:17:56,482 --> 01:17:58,347
Till the point was proven.

593
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:19,167
God, she looks sick.

594
01:18:19,238 --> 01:18:23,299
She's hungry, of course.
It's been a day and a half.

595
01:18:37,023 --> 01:18:40,789
This is where the cracks begin to show.
This is where the dread begins.

596
01:18:48,634 --> 01:18:50,295
You motherfucker!

597
01:18:50,369 --> 01:18:52,701
See? She always ended up cursing me out

598
01:18:52,772 --> 01:18:54,399
whenever she had a confrontation
with the meat.

599
01:18:54,474 --> 01:18:56,408
Go to hell, fuckhead!

600
01:18:57,643 --> 01:19:01,739
Quaid! What are you doing?

601
01:19:01,814 --> 01:19:03,543
Why are you doing this?

602
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:06,074
I'm not gonna do it.

603
01:19:07,787 --> 01:19:10,756
I'm not gonna give you what you want.

604
01:19:13,726 --> 01:19:16,058
I'm not even hungry anymore.

605
01:19:16,496 --> 01:19:20,057
I'd rather die than eat your fucking meat.

606
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:28,363
About now she began to hallucinate.
Little mental ticks.

607
01:19:32,645 --> 01:19:35,045
She'd think that
she'd felt something in her hair

608
01:19:35,114 --> 01:19:37,742
or something on the back of her neck.

609
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,458
- God, the meat looks...
- Ripe?

610
01:19:52,999 --> 01:19:55,365
It's warm in her little room.

611
01:19:57,270 --> 01:20:00,296
And there's a few flies in there with her.

612
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:04,107
They found the meat and laid their eggs.

613
01:20:05,144 --> 01:20:08,841
- Was that a part of your plan, too?
- Yes.

614
01:20:11,117 --> 01:20:14,177
Well, that's the crux of her dilemma,
isn't it?

615
01:20:15,154 --> 01:20:17,714
The longer she waits, the worse it gets.

616
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:36,001
You're sick.

617
01:20:43,916 --> 01:20:46,851
You're nothing but a fucking sadist, Quaid.

618
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:55,187
You motherfucker!

619
01:21:01,567 --> 01:21:03,262
How long now?

620
01:21:03,336 --> 01:21:07,568
- Five days. Six. Six days.
- Six days!

621
01:21:16,549 --> 01:21:17,914
Quaid.

622
01:21:24,190 --> 01:21:25,680
Sorry, Quaid.

623
01:21:28,928 --> 01:21:30,122
Sorry.

624
01:21:33,633 --> 01:21:35,396
Whatever I did,

625
01:21:38,671 --> 01:21:40,036
I'm sorry.

626
01:21:41,707 --> 01:21:43,641
Please just let me out.

627
01:21:45,011 --> 01:21:46,444
Please.

628
01:21:50,049 --> 01:21:51,346
I'm sorry.

629
01:22:38,998 --> 01:22:41,762
It startled me how suddenly she gave in.

630
01:22:42,735 --> 01:22:44,999
Fuck...

631
01:22:45,471 --> 01:22:49,532
She sat in the middle of the room
and ate the meat down to the bone.

632
01:22:49,608 --> 01:22:51,166
Just like that.

633
01:22:59,185 --> 01:23:00,846
Where did she go?

634
01:23:02,388 --> 01:23:04,913
Well, she wandered downstairs.
She came into the kitchen,

635
01:23:04,991 --> 01:23:06,788
drank several glasses of water.

636
01:23:06,859 --> 01:23:09,350
Then she sat on a chair
for three or four hours,

637
01:23:09,428 --> 01:23:12,192
and then I cooked her something to eat,
potatoes, and then she left.

638
01:23:12,264 --> 01:23:14,858
You're fucking lying. I know it.
Where is she?

639
01:23:16,135 --> 01:23:19,696
Look, if it'll make you feel any better,
check the house.

640
01:23:23,709 --> 01:23:26,143
- Who's with you?
- No one. Cut me... Cut me out.

641
01:23:26,212 --> 01:23:28,544
Come on, cut me out, cut me out.
Hurry the fuck up, Quaid.

642
01:26:15,814 --> 01:26:17,509
You motherfucker!

643
01:28:54,173 --> 01:28:59,338
Watching the fear of death,
the pinnacle of all dread approach,

644
01:29:00,913 --> 01:29:02,676
that was the limits.

645
01:29:03,949 --> 01:29:07,544
Someone once wrote that no man
can know his own death.

646
01:29:07,986 --> 01:29:11,319
But to know the death of others, intimately,

647
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:16,225
to watch the tricks that the mind would
surely perform to avoid the bitter truth,

648
01:29:17,196 --> 01:29:20,427
that was a clue to death's nature, wasn't it?

649
01:29:22,801 --> 01:29:26,601
That might, in some small way,
prepare a man for his own death.

650
01:29:41,854 --> 01:29:47,121
To live another's dread vicariously was
the safest, cleverest way to touch the beast.

651
01:30:09,548 --> 01:30:12,915
Steve. No!

652
01:30:14,019 --> 01:30:16,010
No, Steve.

653
01:30:26,365 --> 01:30:29,300
Let's see how hungry you have to be
to get through that.

654
01:30:30,436 --> 01:30:31,425
No.

655
01:30:36,074 --> 01:30:37,473
No!
