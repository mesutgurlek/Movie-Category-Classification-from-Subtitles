1
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:25,390
The boat can leave now.

2
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,886
Tell the crew.

3
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,854
Chopper One to headquarters.
Chopper One to headquarters.

4
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:15,384
We got a sailboat on a collision course
with just about every boat in the harbor.

5
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,928
Where's it at, Chopper One?

6
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:20,056
Just off Staten Island.
It was almost run down by the ferry.

7
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,966
We can't raise anyone on board.

8
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,130
Okay, Chopper One.
We'll send out a patrol boat.

9
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,597
- That must be it, Bill.
- Okay.

10
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,463
We'll take a look at her.

11
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,726
Chopper One to headquarters.

12
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:01,535
The harbor patrol's coming
alongside the sailboat now.

13
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,740
Ahoy there!

14
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,341
This is the harbor patrol.

15
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,011
Anyone on board?

16
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,585
Hey, Sarge, that boats abandoned.

17
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,859
Yeah, she looks abandoned.

18
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,198
The only question is, why?.

19
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,998
Hey, if she is, Marty,

20
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,939
we stand to make a nice little bonus
when we bring her in.

21
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,274
Yeah. Let's get over there
and check

22
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,074
Bring her up alongside.

23
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,509
Chopper One to headquarters.
Chopper One to headquarters.

24
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,951
This is headquarters.
Come in, Chopper One.

25
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:55,985
The harbor patrol is about to
board now. Still no sign of life.

26
00:04:56,062 --> 00:05:00,396
Skipper, that craft
must be a real turkey.

27
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,171
- Hey, watch out forthe sail!
- Huh?

28
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,107
What?.

29
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,009
What the hell's going on?

30
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,605
I'm sorry.
The winch is broken.

31
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,516
I'll fix the sail.
You go below and look around.

32
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,814
Okay.

33
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,327
Hey, grab that on top
and bring it over here.

34
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,584
Okay.

35
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,540
Don't move.

36
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,210
Stay where you are, mister.
Throw your hands on the deck

37
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,655
I told you not to move!

38
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,351
I mean it!

39
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,619
One more step,
and I'm going to blast you.

40
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,221
Don't move, I said!

41
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,863
Don't move!

42
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,385
Where did they find
this abandoned boat?.

43
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:24,293
I'll put someone on it.
The boys in blue been there yet?.

44
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,965
Thanks for your information.
You're a sweetheart.

45
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,031
Get West in here.

46
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,443
Peter, the chief wants you.

47
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,579
Right. Thanks. See you.

48
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,054
- What can I do for you, Chief?.
- Sit down.

49
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,959
- Are you busy now?.
- That depends.

50
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,527
I'm giving you an assignment.
What did she say?.

51
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:03,302
- Pier 15- there's a story there.
- Is it something big?

52
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,611
Boat without anyone on it,
cop killed.

53
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,547
Poke around a bit.
See what you can find.

54
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,210
Okay. I'll let you know.

55
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,345
West.

56
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,912
Keep the British out of
your prose, huh?

57
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,653
- Don't mention your uncle owns the paper.
- As if I would.

58
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,499
They're going over
the last details.

59
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:33,733
They are leaving now.
Do you see them?

60
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,739
Yes, they are bringing the body
to the coroners for an autopsy.

61
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,447
All right, back! Back!

62
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,609
You there, back overthere!
There's nothing to see.

63
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,660
Well, Miss Bowles, we're waitin'.

64
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,823
Yes, it's my father's boat.

65
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,992
Where's your father now?

66
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,831
I don't know.

67
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,339
I was hoping you could tell me.
I haven't heard from him in over a month.

68
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,067
I see.

69
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,201
And how long since you
last spoke to him?

70
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,171
Three months,

71
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:19,149
when he set sail for the Antilles
to join some friends.

72
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,678
The Antilles?

73
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:25,451
Will someone please tell me
what the hell's going on?

74
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,287
We already have.

75
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,059
Man hiding on his boat, which was adrift,
killed a member of the Coast Guard.

76
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,622
Yeah, but... my father-

77
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,635
Where is he?
I mean, what's happened to him?

78
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:41,002
That's just what we'd like
to know, Miss Bowles.

79
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,402
Sorry to get you down here
at this hour.

80
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:17,237
I can't understand
why they're in such a hurry.

81
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,799
I can't understand, myself.

82
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,369
The DA's office phoned twice
before you arrived, Doc.

83
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,608
Well, let's get it over with.

84
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,917
Have you already examined him?

85
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,320
Yeah.

86
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,620
I made one ortwo notes.

87
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:38,096
In my opinion, the death of the poor bastard
was caused by massive hemorrhage

88
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,997
due to a huge laceration
of the jugular.

89
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,598
Do you have a hypothesis
for the cause of this injury?.

90
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,278
Take a look at these edges.

91
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:57,577
To me it's quite obvious
what caused it.

92
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:02,178
There appear to be clear indications
of one or more bites.

93
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,949
Look carefully.

94
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,031
Pass me the scalpel.

95
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,473
I wouldn't be able to cut my way
through tissue paper with that,

96
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,810
let alone carry out an autopsy.

97
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:33,079
Take better care
of your instruments, James.

98
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,809
Don't scream.
Don't scream.

99
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,821
There's nothing to be afraid of.

100
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,153
My name's Peter West,
and I'm a reporter.

101
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,955
I'm gonna take my hand away,
and you're not gonna scream, okay?.

102
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,494
Sorry if I frightened you,
but if I hadn't, you'd have screamed,

103
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,559
and our friend up there
would have been on to both of us.

104
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,367
Who are you, and what are you
doing on my father's boat?.

105
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,306
I've already told you.
My name's West, and I'm a reporter.

106
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,140
- I've been following you all aftemoon.
- Clever.

107
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,804
Professional curiosity?.

108
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,041
The police version doesn't convince me.

109
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,210
I guess it doesn't convince you either.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

110
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,652
What were you looking for?

111
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,622
You got a hell of a nerve.
You know that?.

112
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,387
- You're not so bad yourself.
- Please.

113
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,325
Let me put it this way.

114
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,990
I've got some information,
you've got some information.

115
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:36,330
So why don't we throw it together
and see what we come up with?

116
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,394
I think I've already found
what you're looking for.

117
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,579
What do we do now?.

118
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,016
Well, I've got an idea,
but I'm gonna need your help,

119
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,452
unless you want to explain
to some judge

120
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:33,013
what you were doing on your
father's boat in the middle of the night.

121
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,395
Now, just do what I tell you, okay?.

122
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,954
- Okay.
- Good. Come on.

123
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,264
What the hell's-

124
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,330
Excuse me.

125
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,102
Don't give me the same old story.

126
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,113
- Well, actually, Officer-
- Same old story, huh?

127
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:32,241
This is all your fault.
You realize that, don't you?

128
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:36,617
- It was his idea, not mine.
- Listen to her, Miss Goody Two-shoes.

129
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,213
It wasn't her fault?.
It was all my idea?

130
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,590
Whose idea was it to have
a romantic setting down by the water?.

131
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,595
I'd have settled for an empty boxcar.

132
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,324
No, never again.

133
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,763
Not another boxcar.

134
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,030
She takes after her mother.
They're both bananas.

135
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,697
- You leave my mother out of this!
- She's crazy-

136
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,400
Enough of this!
Both of you, get out of here.

137
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,999
Anything you say.

138
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,545
Come on, sweetie pie.

139
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,781
Good night, Officer.

140
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,374
Yeah.

141
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,079
Out of my sight.

142
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,451
Good night.

143
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:13,286
"To my daughter Anne,
in case anything should happen to me.

144
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:16,418
Due to my morbid curiosity, I have
managed to contraot a strange disease.

145
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,931
They are taking care of me as
if I were some sort of guinea pig,

146
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,432
but I know I'll never leave
this island again,

147
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,093
at least not alive.

148
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,002
I haven't been a good father,
but I have always loved you.

149
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,835
One last kiss from Dad.
Matool. "

150
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:31,501
It's dated 15 September.

151
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:36,745
Listen, Chief. I'm sure there's some
connection that ties this all together.

152
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,840
Well, her father,
the disease he mentions,

153
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,909
the boat, and the guy
that got killed as well.

154
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,487
Yeah, well, it's her idea to go.

155
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,991
Okay, Chief, fine.

156
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,826
And, Chief, you'll fix
the tickets, okay?.

157
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,990
Thanks. You're beautiful.

158
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,344
- I think it's three hours.
- Yes.

159
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,848
If it's on schedule,
we should arrive in St. Thomas at-

160
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:15,011
- Flight 782 for St. Thomas-
- Was that us?

161
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:18,648
- Passengers, proceed to Gate 8.
- Let's go.

162
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,453
No, no, no. I'll do that.

163
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:30,430
Last call for TWA flight 682
to Saint Thomas.

164
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:35,469
All aboard, please.
This is your final call.

165
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:12,672
Do you want to check on the boat,
or should we go to the hotel?

166
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,837
I don't know.
Whatever you think

167
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:18,781
Señor, do you know anyone
who can rent us a boat?.

168
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,283
Boat, señor?.

169
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,116
I'm sorry.
Not easy here to find boat.

170
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:26,624
We want to go to Matool.
It's very important.

171
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,252
I'm willing to pay whatever it costs.

172
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,853
Just now I remember
something, señor.

173
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,195
What did I tell you.

174
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,599
This moming, friend of mine say

175
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,103
two Americans cruise the islands.

176
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,945
That's his boat.

177
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,150
Last one at edge of jetty.

178
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:00,919
Maybe they take you.

179
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,483
You ask

180
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,326
Thanks.

181
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,627
Pedro not help you good, señor?.

182
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:11,159
Surely, yes. Here you are.

183
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,636
Thanks again
and good luck

184
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,856
Extra water.
Store it in the galley.

185
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,516
Aye, aye, sir.

186
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,793
Ahoy there. Hi.

187
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,630
- Hi, yourself.
- How're you doing?

188
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,670
I am Peter West,

189
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,705
and this is Anne Bowles.

190
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,207
Susan Barrett.

191
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,209
And you're talking to Brian Hull.

192
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,541
You wouldn't be looking
for a boat ride?

193
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,810
We would. We hear you're
going on a tour of the islands.

194
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,579
Yeah, a little cruise. Two months
of fishing, bathing and sunshine.

195
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,416
Well, we have to go to Matool.

196
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:11,662
We're trying to locate Anne's father.
She hasn't heard from him for some time.

197
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,127
Matool.

198
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,571
That's not a cool place to hit.

199
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,005
The natives claim it's cursed.
They avoid it.

200
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,940
We have to go there, anyway.

201
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,379
And you want a ride from us?

202
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,424
If that's possible.

203
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,022
Any experience with boats?

204
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,496
Mm-hmm.

205
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,799
And the lady?.

206
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,769
I was bom on a boat.

207
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:06,415
Okay. We'll have to load more supplies.
You pay your share.

208
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,851
- Deal?
- A deal.

209
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,683
Step on board. Here.

210
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,123
I'll wam you right now.

211
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,629
Don't expect us to come sight seeing
once we get there.

212
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:22,462
I found that it never pays
to ignore native superstitions.

213
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:29,268
This is Matool calling
Guadalupa One.

214
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,002
Matool calling Guadalupa One.

215
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,634
Come in, Guadalupa.

216
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,917
This is Dr. Menard
calling Guadalupa One.

217
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,818
Menard calling Guadalupa One.

218
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,618
Come in, Guadalupa One.

219
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,657
Still no luck?.

220
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,725
No.

221
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,829
I'm afraid it's useless
to go on trying.

222
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,298
Then we're cut off
from the rest of the world.

223
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,842
Well, no, hardly.

224
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,381
No, I wouldn't say that.

225
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:14,418
I want to leave
this damn island right now.

226
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,351
Well, you can't right now.

227
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:19,049
The radio isn't working.

228
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,819
How convenient for you.

229
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:24,123
I wouldn't be surprised
if you broke it on purpose.

230
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:31,167
You're tired.

231
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:33,735
Go to hell!

232
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:02,428
David, are you going out?.

233
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,501
I have to go to the hospital.

234
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,867
Have they found another one?

235
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,342
They have, haven't they?.

236
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:16,642
- Tell the truth.
- Now, calm down.

237
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:20,879
- Where did they find it this time?
- You really mustn't drink so much.

238
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,045
I asked you a question.

239
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,752
They're on the other side of the island.

240
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:31,660
When will they reach this side?
Tell me.

241
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,097
I really think you ought to rest.
We'll talk about it later.

242
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:38,192
There's really no need
to agitate yourself so much.

243
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,703
I hate you.

244
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:42,934
No. You don't know
what you're saying.

245
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,276
How you'd like to be able
to pass me off as crazy.

246
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,472
The truth is I'm a danger for you.

247
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,279
Apart from a handful
of superstitious natives,

248
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:56,377
I'm the only one
who knows what you're doing.

249
00:25:56,454 --> 00:26:00,515
And don't think I'm going
to keep my mouth shut.

250
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:05,052
I'm going to tell everyone
that you are the one who's crazy,

251
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,428
demented, cruel, evil-

252
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:19,473
I'll be at the hospital.

253
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,847
Hospital.

254
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:28,784
You still see yourself as
the scientist you once were, don't you?

255
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:33,153
Well, you're not. You're no better
than one of their witch doctors.

256
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:34,851
Just stop it!

257
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,394
- My research is-
- Research!

258
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:42,392
You call fooling around with superstitions
and voodoo rites research?

259
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:46,301
You know perfectly well that the work
I'm doing is very important.

260
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:50,330
- I wouldn't be here if it wasn't.
- I don't give a damn!

261
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:53,468
I don't want to stay on this island
one more hour.

262
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:58,144
You won't be happy
until I meet one of your zombies.

263
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,074
Now, look

264
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:05,989
As soon as I've understood
the phenomenon, we'll leave.

265
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,619
I don't believe you.

266
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,755
I don't believe you.

267
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,625
I don't believe anything you say anymore.

268
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:50,924
Miguel.

269
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,128
Miguel.

270
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:59,876
I have to go to the hospital.
Make sure nobody comes near the house.

271
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:03,505
Si, señor. Miguel guard.
Doctor no worry.

272
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,276
- Nobody.
- Si, señor.

273
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,999
Tell me the depth, Susan.
Will I hit?

274
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,710
Well?

275
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:37,043
Nine, eight.

276
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:41,108
You'll have to pass straight,
this way.

277
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:47,567
- We were lucky to find you two.
- You could say that.

278
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,840
We're sure not having the same luck
trying to find your island.

279
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:52,405
We should be somewhere
around here, right?.

280
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,144
More or less, yeah.

281
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:57,416
But, acoording to the map,
there are no islands forthe next 50 miles.

282
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:58,921
Not necessarily true.

283
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,754
So many islands around here,
a lot haven't been charted.

284
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,852
The last couple we saw aren't
on any chart. It's hit or miss.

285
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:08,558
- We could spend a month out here.
- Like looking for a needle in a haystack

286
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:12,899
- You don't want to go back, do you?
- No. We'll find Matool.

287
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,563
That's a promise.

288
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,142
Don't go counting on us forever.

289
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,610
Don't forget, we're on vacation.

290
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,806
Brian!

291
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,817
It's time to work
I want to take some shots.

292
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,820
Brian, quick,
turn off the motor.

293
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:11,482
Look! Overthere!

294
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,887
See?

295
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:20,128
That's another island.

296
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,428
Maybe we're in luck at last.

297
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,264
Who's to say that that isn't Matool?

298
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,635
Help!

299
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,335
There's a shark!

300
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,877
Help!

301
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,813
It's going to attack her.

302
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:45,246
Hurry!

303
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,614
I'm going back down!

304
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:45,257
- There was a man down there.
- What?.

305
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,296
- There was a man.
- A man?

306
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,492
He's over here, Doctor.

307
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:44,145
Don't think he'll last 'til the morning.

308
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,052
What shall I do?

309
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,329
Take him into the sacristy.

310
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,494
I don't want the others to see him.
There's no need to alarm them.

311
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,004
Tie him down securely.

312
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:04,665
Doctor! Doc!

313
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,404
Doctor, everybody leaving now.

314
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:09,173
Quiet, please.

315
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:11,077
Nurse, look after that patient.

316
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,912
Doctor, the natives leaving village.
Everybody go.

317
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:15,713
What do we do?

318
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,185
Talk about it outside.

319
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,423
- Well, what happened?
- Don't know.

320
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:31,059
Fear in village.
There's great trouble and commotion.

321
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,330
It's the juju man,

322
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:34,598
the new one.

323
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:35,832
It's big and plenty.

324
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:38,204
They seem possessed
by all the devils in hell.

325
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:39,640
How ridiculous.

326
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:44,545
The natives are going crazy.
They run all over village.

327
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:47,049
They pick up their possessions
and disappear.

328
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,710
Where did they go?

329
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,219
They going inland.

330
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,118
They're making voodoo, I think

331
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,749
Voodoo.
Voodoo won't solve anything.

332
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:58,261
Doctor, they're afraid.

333
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,990
Very much afraid, these people.

334
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,759
You too.

335
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,994
You're afraid, aren't you, Lucas?

336
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:13,320
This is all right.

337
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:16,958
Give her two orthree feet of slack,
and then tie her off.

338
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,563
Doctor.

339
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,129
Doctor Menard.

340
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:29,475
What?.

341
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,070
What's wrong?

342
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:32,410
Matthias.

343
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:34,382
Matthias?

344
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:35,884
Matthias what?.

345
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:38,084
He's-

346
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:42,591
Why don't you say it?.

347
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:45,093
Are you afraid to say it?
Huh?

348
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,458
It's not that.
I don't believe in voodoo.

349
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,559
I don't believe in voodoo either,
but the natives do.

350
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,366
So we investigate
the phenomena, right?.

351
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,901
I've seen them,
and you've seen them.

352
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:04,075
Now, Matthias,
he's one of them, is he?

353
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:10,745
Well, we have to help him.
We have to try to help him.

354
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:13,585
So we go to the hospital.
Come on.

355
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:22,588
The drive shafts cracked.
It must've been the shark when he hit us.

356
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:24,258
Is it serious?

357
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:25,926
Well, we have two possibilities:

358
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:30,099
Either we go ashore and walk around
until we come to the local repair shop,

359
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:32,073
- or-
- Or?.

360
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:36,306
Or we remain here, fire off some flares
and hope that somebody will help us.

361
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:41,010
We'll have a tough time making it to the next
island if we don't get that shaft fixed.

362
00:48:57,634 --> 00:48:59,397
Poor Matthias.

363
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:38,497
Let's go.

364
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,264
- What is it, Lucas?
- Rockets.

365
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:04,130
There's somebody firing rockets.

366
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:08,227
- Rockets?
- I see them, man.

367
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:13,267
- You know where they come from?
- They coming from Catfish Bay.

368
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,271
I better go and investigate.

369
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,338
Take care of him for me.

370
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,046
Who is It?. The devil?

371
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,453
We'll know soon enough.
Let's get this over with.

372
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:09,356
Bury them now, Missey?.

373
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:10,923
No, not yet.

374
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:14,835
There are two more
who are going to die soon.

375
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:25,839
Dad! Where are you?

376
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:32,683
Why did you leave me alone to die?

377
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:36,749
I've seen you.

378
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,222
With my own eyes.

379
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:45,130
Come to me.

380
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,363
Father.

381
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,905
Don't leave me.

382
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:53,069
I buried you,

383
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:57,812
but I see you walking.

384
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:17,698
I met your father
about three years ago

385
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:20,031
when he first came out
to these islands.

386
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:24,199
Whenever he could, he would stay
for a few weeks here with me...

387
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:25,866
on Matool.

388
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:29,872
Then he...

389
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:33,174
became a victim of the disease.

390
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:38,081
He insisted upon staying
in spite of everything I said to him.

391
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:42,191
I insisted that he should leave,
but he wouldn't.

392
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:46,992
He felt that he could in some way
become a guinea pig,

393
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:51,397
that he could help in discovering
what was causing the horrors

394
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:54,028
that were destroying our island,

395
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:57,665
transforming it into
a wasteland of terror.

396
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:01,837
Extremely courageous man.

397
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:06,805
I remember the day

398
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:09,545
when my assistant came to tell me

399
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,678
that your father was dying.

400
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:16,222
Doctor!
Your friend. Quickly.

401
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:33,942
Get closer.
It's over for me.

402
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,376
I feel I'm about to die.

403
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:38,607
I've had a good life,

404
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:41,674
but I never thought
it would end this way.

405
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:47,382
I've got two things to ask
Listen carefully.

406
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:50,585
They're very important, my friend.

407
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:54,756
I have written to my dear child Anne.

408
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:57,925
The letter, see that it gets to her.

409
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:01,796
And make sure...

410
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:05,898
my soul rests
in everlasting peace.

411
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:15,579
I spent the day
watching over his body.

412
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:20,385
But I knew eventually
I would have to find the courage

413
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:24,154
to release him from the living dead.

414
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:40,598
The boat can leave now.

415
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,831
Tell the crew.

416
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:01,450
What exactly did my father die of?

417
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:05,119
- And what happened to the boats crew?.
- Yes, Doctor.

418
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,221
What is all this about the dead
coming back to life again

419
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:10,698
and having to be killed
a second time?

420
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,758
What the hell's going on here?

421
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:15,532
- You ever heard of voodoo?
- Voodoo?

422
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:18,438
Doctor, you gotta be joking.
That's kid stuff.

423
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:21,875
I mean, voodoo's just
plain superstitious horseshit.

424
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:24,106
Basically, it's a mixture
of two religions.

425
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,946
One- Catholicism, brought here
by the Spanish conquistadores.

426
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:32,113
And two- African tribal rites that
were brought here by the slave trade.

427
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:33,678
Well, whatever it is,

428
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:37,125
it makes the dead stand up and walk

429
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:40,424
- I've seen it with my own eyes.
- That's impossible.

430
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,328
I know it's impossible.

431
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:46,401
I've seen it.

432
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:48,733
The natives say it's...

433
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:50,739
something to do with voodoo.

434
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,970
Some evil witch doctor
creates these zombies,

435
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:56,910
but I'm sure there's
a natural explanation,

436
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,346
and I'm determined to find it.

437
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:11,787
Something's happened to Mr. Fritz.

438
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:13,522
What happened to him?

439
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,961
No one told me.

440
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:19,691
Take a look

441
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:24,806
Go inside.

442
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,637
Bad news?

443
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:33,280
Fritz, a friend of mine,

444
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:36,978
happens to be the only other
white man on the island.

445
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:39,647
He's had an accident.
We've got him at the hospital.

446
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:42,589
- I'm sure he'll be all right.
- Is there anything we can do?

447
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:44,354
No, no. Thank you.

448
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:46,418
As you wish.

449
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:48,826
Well, yes.

450
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:51,992
My wife's alone at the cottage.

451
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:54,366
Our manservant is looking after her.

452
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:56,701
I'd be very grateful
if you'd call on her.

453
00:57:56,773 --> 00:58:00,174
It's only seven or eight miles up the trail.
You can't miss it.

454
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:02,268
Go on. I'll see you later.

455
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:42,948
Doctor, I thought it was
more advisable to bring him here.

456
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:46,277
You did right.

457
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:53,762
What happened to your arm, Fritz?.

458
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,627
I left the living dead.

459
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:59,665
Too late.

460
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:01,567
I saw it too late.

461
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:03,697
Where?
Where did you see this?

462
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,698
In the village.

463
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:09,440
I saw it.

464
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:10,911
I can't-

465
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,413
In this village?

466
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:13,915
Yeah.

467
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:18,545
- Tell Lucas to lock all the doors.
- It's no use.

468
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:21,783
It's a waste of time
to lock the doors.

469
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:24,520
They'll be here soon...

470
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:27,992
to destroy us all.

471
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:59,627
We must have driven
eight miles by now.

472
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:01,459
Yes, more than that.

473
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:05,092
Why don't we just sail to the nearest
place where we know there's a shipyard?

474
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:08,331
- After we've seen the doctor's wife.
- Look, Peter. Is that it?.

475
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,015
Nice layout.

476
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:30,684
This is the nicest place
on the island.

477
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,024
The doctor's doing all right,
by the look of it.

478
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:35,530
But there's something fishy
about him.

479
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:00,049
Mrs. Menard.

480
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:03,118
Mrs. Menard?

481
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:08,330
It doesn't seem like anybody's at home.
What do we do now?.

482
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:10,389
Might as well go inside.

483
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:19,304
Is there anybody here?

484
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:46,517
Come on.

485
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,262
Brian, you drive.

486
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:55,561
Quick, Brian! Hurry!

487
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:58,072
Get us out of here, please!

488
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:10,686
My God, did my father
become one of those?

489
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:12,880
No, he didn't.
You heard the doctor.

490
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:15,150
Let's find that hospital and get the
hell out of here as quickly as we can.

491
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:54,395
Look out!

492
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,072
Damn it.

493
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:29,925
The radiator's had it.

494
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:33,093
Well, I think my ankle's
gone the same way.

495
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:35,933
We're gonna have to walk now.
Think you can make It?.

496
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:38,940
- We don't have much choice, do we?
- Come on.

497
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:41,238
Let's get to that hospital before dark

498
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,504
Give him a hand.

499
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:17,545
Drums.

500
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:19,513
Getting closer.

501
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:22,783
I hate it!

502
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:24,786
Damn you, you bastards!

503
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:27,547
I can't take it.

504
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:30,422
Come on.

505
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:33,587
They're doing a little voodoo on us.

506
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:35,995
Yes, well, anyway, let's hurry up.

507
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:39,294
It's going to be dark soon.

508
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,731
Lucas?

509
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:18,666
You know what is the cause of all this?

510
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:23,571
- Is it voodoo?
- Lucas not know nothing, man.

511
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,580
The father of my father always say,

512
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,809
when the earth spit out the dead,

513
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:30,147
they will come back
to suck the blood from the living.

514
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:31,914
That's nonsense.

515
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,115
That's just a stupid superstition.

516
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:39,294
Yes, you are right, Doctor.
You know many more things than Lucas.

517
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:43,822
I don't believe that voodoo
can bring the dead back to life.

518
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:48,268
And Lucas not believe...
that the dead be dead.

519
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:52,771
No. It's no good.

520
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:55,072
I can't go any further.

521
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:56,668
Gotta rest up for a bit.

522
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:57,979
Okay, Peter.

523
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,847
We'll take a quick five here.

524
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:04,283
Gotta be close to that
damn hospital now.

525
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:06,651
Look. Why don't you two rest here.

526
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:09,623
And we'll take a look up ahead, right?

527
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:34,976
- What is it?
- It's a helmet.

528
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:38,416
Must be over 400 years old.

529
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:13,088
This must have been a cemetery
for the Spanish Conquistadores.

530
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:26,291
I'm sorry I dragged you into all this.

531
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:29,531
It's my father we came
looking for, isn't it?

532
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:32,230
You know,

533
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:34,333
when we get back to New York-

534
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:38,107
Uh-uh.
You don't have to say anything now.

535
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:42,477
It's just-

536
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:46,920
I'm so scared we're not
gonna make it off this island.

537
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:46,898
Susan.

538
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:55,341
Come on, let's go,
before it's too late.

539
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:59,209
We can't leave her here alone.

540
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:03,081
- She's dead.
- Brian, don't you understand? She's dead.

541
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,643
There's nothing that you can do here.

542
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:12,617
Come on, man. Let's go.

543
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:58,057
Brian!

544
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:02,066
- Leave me here.
- Come on, get up!

545
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:17,976
Is that a church?

546
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:26,224
We've done it.

547
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:35,435
He's fading rapidly.

548
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:37,734
Shall I continue with the transfusion?

549
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,771
It's useless.

550
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:43,175
He's gonna die anyway.

551
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:47,011
Doctor! Please! Open the door!

552
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,641
Come on, Doctor!

553
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,118
Open the door now!

554
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:06,093
Out there,
they're coming back to life.

555
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,658
They're everywhere.

556
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:54,909
What about my wife?

557
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:11,522
Thank you.

558
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:20,466
What the hell are they, Doctor?

559
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:23,538
I don't know.

560
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:28,144
It all started about
three months ago.

561
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:31,913
One of the fishermen
said he'd seen his wife

562
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:34,217
walking in the village at night,

563
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:38,325
only she'd been dead for two days.

564
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:43,154
Well, at the time,
nobody believed the story.

565
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:45,827
In these islands,

566
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:48,062
fantastic legends-

567
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:51,905
voodooism, zombies-

568
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:56,306
have been around for centuries.

569
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:12,685
As a man of science,

570
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:15,457
I don't believe in voodooism.

571
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:19,261
But the phenomenon
defies logical explanation.

572
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:25,198
I've attempted to apply
the disciplines of bacteriology,

573
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,267
virology,

574
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:30,174
even of radiology.

575
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:35,507
We've performed tests for epilepsy

576
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:37,313
and for catalepsy.

577
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:41,685
Nothing fits.

578
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:53,463
- Will that hold 'em?
- Not a chance.

579
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,969
- How can we stop them?
- Here, take this.

580
01:17:56,038 --> 01:17:58,802
I've got another gun in my office.

581
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:04,070
There's two drums of kerosene
in the sacristy.

582
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:07,377
Right, Doc. You two stay where you are.
Watch those windows.

583
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,397
Nurse, come with me.

584
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:31,735
We've gotta get some empty bottles,
all you can find.

585
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:08,091
Dr. Menard.

586
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:27,872
No!

587
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:30,778
No! No!

588
01:21:57,279 --> 01:21:59,440
You bring some too.
Come on.

589
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:21,732
Go get some more bottles.

590
01:24:39,874 --> 01:24:41,933
Brian, two more.

591
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:12,056
Shoot her, West!

592
01:26:12,367 --> 01:26:14,358
Shoot her!

593
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:19,197
Shoot her!

594
01:26:28,216 --> 01:26:31,413
Come on, Brian.
We have to get to the boat.

595
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:10,818
Can't we go any faster?

596
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:14,192
The drive shaft could go any second.

597
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:16,890
We'll make it to San Cristobal.

598
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:19,695
There's a yard there that can fix-

599
01:27:22,203 --> 01:27:23,465
What is it?

600
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:27,473
I feel so cold. So cold.

601
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:31,537
I don't want to become like-

602
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,848
Take me home, Peter.

603
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:36,383
Save me.

604
01:27:37,218 --> 01:27:38,685
Save me.

605
01:27:40,021 --> 01:27:42,285
I beg you.

606
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:19,783
He's dead.

607
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:24,120
What do we do now?

608
01:28:24,198 --> 01:28:27,690
Lock him in the bilge,
take him back with us to the States.

609
01:28:27,769 --> 01:28:30,260
Someone there might be able
to do something.

610
01:28:30,338 --> 01:28:33,364
But... we can't risk it.
You know what he might turn into.

611
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:35,375
Well, I'll make sure that he's safe.

612
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:37,377
We've got to take him back with us.

613
01:28:37,445 --> 01:28:39,913
He's the only proof we've got
that this all happened.

614
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:41,915
And we will need proof, unfortunately.

615
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:44,918
Otherwise, they'll just think
that we're crazy.

616
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:47,147
I don't care.

617
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:49,314
I feel dead myself.

618
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,355
Take the wheel.

619
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:18,911
Let's see if we can find something
more cheerful on the radio.

620
01:29:20,788 --> 01:29:23,723
In the latest news,
the situation here in New York City

621
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:26,885
since the discovery of the first zombie
is getting worse by the hour.

622
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:30,858
There's chaos in the streets.

623
01:29:30,932 --> 01:29:36,529
The National Guard
cannot control the situation.

624
01:29:36,604 --> 01:29:38,834
In every borough of the city,

625
01:29:38,906 --> 01:29:39,964
from Bronx to Brooklyn,

626
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,373
from Queens to Coney Island,

627
01:29:42,443 --> 01:29:45,469
the zombies are everywhere.

628
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:50,950
The governor has declared
a state of national emergency

629
01:29:51,018 --> 01:29:55,580
and has asked the president
for immediate assistance.

630
01:29:55,656 --> 01:30:01,322
The zombies are everywhere.
There seems to be no way to stop them.

631
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:02,658
The city is at their mercy.

632
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:06,625
Barricades have been thrown up
throughout Manhattan.

633
01:30:06,701 --> 01:30:11,001
General Stein of the National Guard said
that missiles will be used if necessary.

634
