1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:03,087
Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:03,207 --> 00:00:06,128
We're friends with the chick with the sword
and the kid with the hat.

3
00:00:06,248 --> 00:00:07,547
They attacked us.

4
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:09,153
I don't believe you.

5
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:14,540
- Who the hell are these people?
- They ain't people.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,836
We fight to the fence!

7
00:00:22,153 --> 00:00:23,447
You have to go with me.

8
00:00:25,032 --> 00:00:27,199
- We need to go.
- Go where?

9
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,835
Somewhere far away from there.

10
00:00:59,252 --> 00:01:00,888
Not so fast.

11
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,664
You didn't want to be there.

12
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:22,034
That's why I tried
to talk to you.

13
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:27,379
Glenn told me
you saved his life.

14
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:30,151
He saved mine.

15
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:34,264
That's how it works
with us, right?

16
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:36,166
Right.

17
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:39,405
Hey.

18
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:46,050
Get something to eat.

19
00:01:46,052 --> 00:01:47,785
We'll start back at sunup.

20
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,073
Talked to Rick.

21
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:28,946
Some of them know what you did

22
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,549
at the prison.

23
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,325
Daryl, Maggie.

24
00:02:35,327 --> 00:02:37,930
They accept it.

25
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:40,201
You wouldn't be here
if they didn't.

26
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,145
Gonna talk to the rest of them.

27
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:46,382
Tell them to accept it, too.

28
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,321
They don't have to.

29
00:02:51,892 --> 00:02:54,559
No, they do.

30
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:57,394
They just do.

31
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:05,600
We don't need to tell them
about the girls.

32
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,500
I don't want to.

33
00:03:09,004 --> 00:03:10,606
Why?

34
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,407
I just need to forget it.

35
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:54,282
I got it.

36
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,538
Right there is why we're
waiting for our moment.

37
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,110
Yeah, fair enough.

38
00:04:27,755 --> 00:04:30,021
I owe you everything.

39
00:04:31,457 --> 00:04:34,360
You owe Tyreese.
He was at the prison.

40
00:04:36,894 --> 00:04:38,895
You got back there.

41
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:56,608
It was in one
of their storerooms.

42
00:04:58,142 --> 00:05:00,544
I saw them kill him.

43
00:05:00,546 --> 00:05:02,513
That kid.

44
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,587
Mm-mmm.

45
00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:26,336
I still don't know
about what you did...

46
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:32,038
but I know you knew
some things I didn't.

47
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:35,643
I sent you away to this--

48
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:39,046
You said I could survive.
You were right.

49
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:46,759
I sent you away to this
and now we're joining you.

50
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:54,769
Will you have us?

51
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,874
Thank you.

52
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:28,758
I don't want to talk about it.

53
00:06:30,094 --> 00:06:32,195
I can't.

54
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,199
I just need to forget it.

55
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:45,835
All right.

56
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,903
It's nothing.

57
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:56,445

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

58
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:10,165
We surrender.

59
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,939
No tracks.
No nothing.

60
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:18,908
So whatever you heard
last night...

61
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,510
It's more what I felt.

62
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:23,713
If someone was watching us,

63
00:08:23,715 --> 00:08:25,648
there would have been something.

64
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,590
Keep close.

65
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:34,529
Ready to get some concrete
under your feet?

66
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:36,230
I think it's time.

67
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:39,066
That is sweet music
to my ears, Officer.

68
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:40,935
Take the next road we come to,

69
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,271
try to get back to going north
till we find a vehicle.

70
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,207
- Good?
- Good.

71
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:48,776
Tighten it up.

72
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,979
Uh, wet socks.

73
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:52,480
Cool feet.

74
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:54,082
Mosquito bites.

75
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:56,518
Itching reminds you
you're alive.

76
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,787
Danger around every corner.

77
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:01,356
Never a dull moment.

78
00:09:01,358 --> 00:09:03,659
The hot sun beating down on you.

79
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:06,429
Come on, a glorious tan.

80
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,365
I said it and I meant it.

81
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,571
No privacy.

82
00:09:13,573 --> 00:09:15,474
Captive audience.

83
00:09:17,244 --> 00:09:18,677
One more.

84
00:09:19,678 --> 00:09:21,210
One more.

85
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,548
He's a damn expert at that.

86
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,550
- What was it?
- A little game.

87
00:09:27,552 --> 00:09:30,085
Good out of the bad.

88
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:32,485
<i>Help!</i>

89
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:35,285
- <i> Help, anybody! Help!</i>
- Dad, come on.

90
00:09:35,287 --> 00:09:37,788
Come on!

91
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,992
- Come on.
- <i> Anyone, help!</i>

92
00:09:39,994 --> 00:09:41,493
<i>Help!</i>

93
00:09:41,495 --> 00:09:44,429
<i> Help! Help! Help!</i>

94
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:47,064
Anybody, help!

95
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:48,530
Help!

96
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:51,835
Help!

97
00:09:51,837 --> 00:09:54,072
Help! Help!

98
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:56,207
Help! Help!

99
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:58,613
<i>Help!</i>

100
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:08,023
Whoa! Whoa!

101
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:18,837
We're clear.
Keep watch.

102
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:25,872
<i>Come on down.</i>

103
00:10:37,156 --> 00:10:38,657
You okay?

104
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:50,067
Sorry.

105
00:10:52,906 --> 00:10:55,005
Yes.

106
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:56,574
Thank you.

107
00:10:58,509 --> 00:10:59,534
I'm Gabriel.

108
00:10:59,654 --> 00:11:01,611
Do you have any weapons on you?

109
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:07,280
Do I look like
I would have any weapons?

110
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:11,219
We don't give two short and
curlies what it looks like.

111
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:14,355
I have no weapons of any kind.

112
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:17,058
The word of God is the
only protection I need.

113
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,527
Sure didn't look like it.

114
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:24,698
I called for help.
Help came.

115
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,812
Do you have--

116
00:11:34,814 --> 00:11:36,914
have any food?

117
00:11:38,218 --> 00:11:40,854
Whatever I--

118
00:11:40,856 --> 00:11:44,559
I had left,
it just hit the ground.

119
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:47,160
We've got some pecans.

120
00:11:49,862 --> 00:11:51,093
Thank you.

121
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:01,910
That's a beautiful child.

122
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,023
- Do you have a camp?
- No. Do you?

123
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:21,928
I have a church.

124
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,664
Hold your hands above your head.

125
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:30,505
How many walkers
have you killed?

126
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,507
Not any, actually.

127
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:36,008
Turn around.

128
00:12:37,744 --> 00:12:39,679
How many people have you killed?

129
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:43,816
None.

130
00:12:43,818 --> 00:12:45,684
Why?

131
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:50,692
Because the Lord
abhors violence.

132
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,161
What have you done?

133
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,365
We've all done something.

134
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:06,335
I'm a sinner.

135
00:13:06,337 --> 00:13:08,970
I sin almost every day.

136
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:12,406
But those sins,
I confess them to God,

137
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:14,775
not strangers.

138
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:16,410
You said you had a church?

139
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:23,186
Hey, earlier,

140
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:25,755
were you watching us?

141
00:13:25,757 --> 00:13:27,958
I keep to myself.

142
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,026
Nowadays, people
are just as dangerous

143
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:31,561
as the dead, don't you think?

144
00:13:31,563 --> 00:13:33,765
No, people are worse.

145
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:36,270
<i>Well, I
wasn't watching you.</i>

146
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:38,170
I haven't been beyond
the stream near my church

147
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:39,938
more than a few times
since it all started.

148
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,006
That was the furthest
I've gone before today.

149
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:49,152
Or maybe I'm lying.

150
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:52,523
Maybe I'm lying about everything and
there's no church ahead at all.

151
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:55,793
Maybe I'm leading you into a trap
so I can steal all your squirrels.

152
00:14:02,297 --> 00:14:05,134
Members of my flock
had often told me

153
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:08,105
that my sense of humor
leaves much to be desired.

154
00:14:08,107 --> 00:14:09,740
Yeah, it does.

155
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:32,859
Hold up.

156
00:14:32,861 --> 00:14:35,161
Can we take a look around first?

157
00:14:35,163 --> 00:14:38,162
We just want to hold on
to our squirrels.

158
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:53,699
I spent months here without
stepping out the front door.

159
00:16:53,701 --> 00:16:56,402
If you found someone inside,

160
00:16:56,404 --> 00:16:58,105
well, it would have
been surprising.

161
00:16:59,942 --> 00:17:01,945
Thanks for this.

162
00:17:01,947 --> 00:17:04,247
We found a short bus out back.

163
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:07,751
It don't run, but I bet we could fix
that in less than a day or two.

164
00:17:07,753 --> 00:17:09,585
Father here says
he doesn't want it.

165
00:17:09,587 --> 00:17:12,019
Looks like we found
ourselves some transport.

166
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:16,191
You understand what's
at stake here, right?

167
00:17:16,193 --> 00:17:17,826
Yes, I do.

168
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:18,960
Now that we can
take a breath--

169
00:17:18,962 --> 00:17:20,794
We take a breath, we slow down,

170
00:17:20,796 --> 00:17:22,294
shit inevitably goes down.

171
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:24,795
We need supplies
no matter what we do next.

172
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:27,965
That's right.
Water, food, ammunition.

173
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:31,004
Short bus ain't going nowhere.

174
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:32,940
Bring you back some baked beans.

175
00:17:36,242 --> 00:17:38,612
One way or another,
we're doing what Rick does.

176
00:17:38,614 --> 00:17:40,079
We're not splitting up again.

177
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:47,287
What he said.

178
00:17:50,955 --> 00:17:54,293
We want to roll with you, but...
what she said.

179
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:03,441
How'd you survive
here for so long?

180
00:18:03,443 --> 00:18:05,542
Where did your supplies
come from?

181
00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:09,645
Luck.

182
00:18:09,647 --> 00:18:12,012
Our annual canned food drive.

183
00:18:12,014 --> 00:18:14,647
Things fell apart
right after we finished it.

184
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:16,147
It was just me.

185
00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:18,084
Come here, Judith.

186
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:20,120
The food lasted a long time.

187
00:18:20,122 --> 00:18:22,588
And then I started scavenging.

188
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,323
I've cleaned out
every place nearby.

189
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:27,258
Except for one.

190
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,860
What kept you from it?

191
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:31,661
It's overrun.

192
00:18:31,663 --> 00:18:33,262
How many?

193
00:18:33,264 --> 00:18:35,697
A dozen or so.
Maybe more.

194
00:18:37,932 --> 00:18:39,964
We can handle a dozen.

195
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:42,334
Bob and I will go with you.

196
00:18:42,336 --> 00:18:45,536
Tyreese should stay here,
help keep Judith safe.

197
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:47,603
That'll be okay?

198
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:49,604
Sure.

199
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:52,174
You ever need me to watch her,

200
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:55,007
need anything for her,
I'm right here.

201
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,043
I'm grateful for it.

202
00:18:58,278 --> 00:19:01,311
And everything else.

203
00:19:01,313 --> 00:19:03,416
- I'll draw you a map.
- You don't need to.

204
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:05,319
You're coming with us.

205
00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:08,668
I'm not gonna be of any help.

206
00:19:08,788 --> 00:19:10,891
You saw me.

207
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:13,295
I'm no good around those things.

208
00:19:13,297 --> 00:19:15,297
You're coming with us.

209
00:19:20,632 --> 00:19:23,842
Listen, I don't trust this guy.

210
00:19:23,844 --> 00:19:24,909
Why?

211
00:19:26,511 --> 00:19:28,482
Why do you trust him?

212
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,554
Everybody can't be bad.

213
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:36,763
Well...

214
00:19:36,765 --> 00:19:39,068
I don't trust this guy.

215
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,569
And that's why
I'm bringing him with me.

216
00:19:42,904 --> 00:19:45,074
But he could have friends.

217
00:19:45,076 --> 00:19:46,909
So I need you to stay alert

218
00:19:46,911 --> 00:19:49,879
and help Tyreese
protect Judith, okay?

219
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:53,080
Now...

220
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:56,282
I need you to hear
what I'm about to say.

221
00:19:56,284 --> 00:19:57,751
Okay.

222
00:20:00,021 --> 00:20:02,887
You are not safe.

223
00:20:04,189 --> 00:20:06,925
No matter how many
people are around

224
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:08,960
or how clear the area looks,

225
00:20:08,962 --> 00:20:10,428
no matter what anyone says,

226
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,297
no matter what you think,

227
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:14,132
you are not safe.

228
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:17,467
It only takes one second.

229
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:20,838
One second and it's over.

230
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:25,111
Never let your guard down, ever.

231
00:20:25,113 --> 00:20:26,846
I want you to promise me.

232
00:20:26,848 --> 00:20:29,582
- I promise.
- Okay.

233
00:20:29,584 --> 00:20:31,482
Dad.

234
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:36,958
You're right.
I am strong.

235
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,960
We both are.

236
00:20:40,263 --> 00:20:42,463
But we're strong enough

237
00:20:42,465 --> 00:20:45,332
that we can still help people.

238
00:20:45,334 --> 00:20:48,337
And we can handle ourselves
if things go wrong.

239
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:51,137
And we're strong enough

240
00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:53,274
that we don't have to be afraid

241
00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:55,412
and we don't have to hide.

242
00:20:57,681 --> 00:21:00,215
Well, he's hiding something.

243
00:21:04,557 --> 00:21:07,161
I'll stay safe, Dad.

244
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:10,399
Yeah.

245
00:21:18,848 --> 00:21:21,314
Hey.

246
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:24,346
When you said
they don't get to live,

247
00:21:24,348 --> 00:21:26,349
you weren't wrong.

248
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:31,014
We push ourselves
and let things go.

249
00:21:31,016 --> 00:21:34,451
Then we let some more
go and some more.

250
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:37,652
And pretty soon, there's
things we can't get back.

251
00:21:37,654 --> 00:21:40,154
Things we couldn't hold
on to even if we tried.

252
00:21:41,956 --> 00:21:44,590
Washington's gonna happen, Rick.

253
00:21:44,592 --> 00:21:46,990
I haven't decided
if we're going.

254
00:21:46,992 --> 00:21:48,990
Yeah, I know, and that's cool.

255
00:21:48,992 --> 00:21:51,156
But you've seen
Abraham in action.

256
00:21:51,158 --> 00:21:53,824
He's gonna get there and
Eugene's gonna cure all this

257
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:57,563
and you're gonna find yourself in a place
where it's like how it used to be.

258
00:21:57,565 --> 00:22:00,129
And if you've let
too much go along the way,

259
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:02,132
that's not gonna work.

260
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:06,904
'Cause you gonna be back
in the real world.

261
00:22:06,906 --> 00:22:09,806
This is the real world, Bob.

262
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:11,806
Naw.

263
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:15,174
This is a nightmare,
and nightmares end.

264
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:18,576
I'm sorry.
I'm calling it.

265
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:21,914
Washington's gonna happen.
You're gonna say yes.

266
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,247
Already too much momentum.

267
00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:27,984
You can't fight city hall.

268
00:22:27,986 --> 00:22:30,653
Maybe that's just one of those
parts of not letting go.

269
00:22:36,631 --> 00:22:38,598
Hey, I get it.

270
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,633
You don't want to talk about it.

271
00:22:41,635 --> 00:22:44,068
You okay?

272
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,905
Gotta be.

273
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,043
We get to start over.

274
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:51,344
All of us with each other.

275
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,016
You saved us all by yourself.

276
00:22:56,018 --> 00:22:58,016
We got lucky.

277
00:22:58,018 --> 00:22:59,980
We all should be dead.

278
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:05,084
I'll check it.

279
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:06,719
<i>All right.</i>

280
00:23:23,972 --> 00:23:25,438
Hey.

281
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,372
We ain't dead.

282
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:31,277
And whatever happened, happened.

283
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,080
Let's start over.

284
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:41,185
- I want to.
- Well, you can.

285
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:51,768
We should leave this
here for backup

286
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,937
in case things go south
at the church.

287
00:23:55,874 --> 00:23:57,875
Want me to carry one of those?

288
00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:02,613
No.

289
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:09,018
You know, I didn't want
to mention anything

290
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,218
when we looked this place up
in the phone book,

291
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,422
but I just can't imagine a gun
store having leftovers nowadays.

292
00:24:14,424 --> 00:24:16,054
Don't look good, does it?

293
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,965
Was it a walker?

294
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:28,904
Uh, yeah.
It was a walker.

295
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:30,573
Really?

296
00:24:33,545 --> 00:24:36,014
It was a stack of boxes
and a mop and I tripped.

297
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,182
Still...

298
00:24:38,184 --> 00:24:40,319
got what we came for.

299
00:24:40,321 --> 00:24:42,055
You actually found something?

300
00:24:42,057 --> 00:24:44,791
Three silencers stashed
in a mini-fridge.

301
00:24:46,163 --> 00:24:48,130
Rule number one
of scavenging--

302
00:24:48,132 --> 00:24:50,212
there's nothing left in this
world that isn't hidden.

303
00:24:56,107 --> 00:24:58,443
We're here.

304
00:24:58,445 --> 00:25:00,110
This was the food bank.

305
00:25:00,112 --> 00:25:02,310
It served the whole county.

306
00:25:02,312 --> 00:25:04,780
All the cans at my church
were gonna end up here.

307
00:26:01,742 --> 00:26:03,841
If a sewer could puke,

308
00:26:03,843 --> 00:26:05,876
this is what it'd smell like.

309
00:26:13,256 --> 00:26:16,024
The water's been coming down
that hole for a while.

310
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:19,895
<i>Slimed this place up good.</i>

311
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:25,036
<i>We can use the
shelves to block them.</i>

312
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:28,472
Yeah, that's it, Sasha.

313
00:26:29,941 --> 00:26:31,574
There's our way.

314
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:34,242
Down those shelves.

315
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:42,450
Hey.

316
00:26:42,452 --> 00:26:44,484
I said you're coming with us.

317
00:26:54,933 --> 00:26:57,200
Go! Go!

318
00:26:57,202 --> 00:26:58,108
Here they come.

319
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:01,204
You take right.

320
00:27:04,175 --> 00:27:05,776
<i>I see three here.</i>

321
00:27:05,778 --> 00:27:07,277
<i>You got it?</i>

322
00:27:52,266 --> 00:27:54,670
We have to get Gabriel.

323
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:57,007
- What happened?
- I don't know.

324
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,310
All right, we'll push down the
shelves on the ones in front of us.

325
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:01,912
We'll fight through
and I'll grab him.

326
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,449
<i>Go!</i>

327
00:28:43,062 --> 00:28:44,798
Yeah.

328
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,833
I know which way
it's gonna break.

329
00:28:51,406 --> 00:28:52,774
Bob!

330
00:29:12,145 --> 00:29:14,512
You okay?
Bob, you okay?

331
00:29:14,514 --> 00:29:16,511
I'm fine now.

332
00:29:26,088 --> 00:29:27,756
I'm sorry.

333
00:29:27,758 --> 00:29:30,188
I-- I panicked.

334
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,859
- I told you I--
- You knew her when she was alive?

335
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,331
Yeah, I get it.

336
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,568
You only tell your sins to God.

337
00:29:50,943 --> 00:29:52,877
Do you miss the sword?

338
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:55,114
Wasn't really mine
in the first place.

339
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,518
Found it in the very beginning.

340
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:04,461
How'd you get so good?

341
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:10,263
It was just me and them out here

342
00:30:10,265 --> 00:30:13,362
all day, every day

343
00:30:13,364 --> 00:30:15,130
a good long time.

344
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:19,933
I don't know what that
was, but it wasn't a life.

345
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,503
Not like today.

346
00:30:24,939 --> 00:30:27,140
Stumbling around
in three feet of slime

347
00:30:27,142 --> 00:30:30,447
for some peas and
carrots, that's living.

348
00:30:33,448 --> 00:30:35,850
I miss Andrea.

349
00:30:38,321 --> 00:30:40,756
I miss Hershel.

350
00:30:40,758 --> 00:30:44,659
- Yeah.
- I don't miss what was before.

351
00:30:44,661 --> 00:30:46,595
I don't miss that sword.

352
00:30:52,803 --> 00:30:54,539
Hey.

353
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:56,608
Tyreese said you were out back.

354
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:59,312
Come on in.
We found food.

355
00:30:59,314 --> 00:31:01,348
- A lot of it.
- Good.

356
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:04,549
What is it?

357
00:31:05,785 --> 00:31:07,955
Those scratches.

358
00:31:07,957 --> 00:31:09,556
They're deep.

359
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:12,323
Like knives or something.

360
00:31:12,325 --> 00:31:14,161
<i>Someone was trying to get in.</i>

361
00:31:18,331 --> 00:31:20,332
I found something else.

362
00:31:22,035 --> 00:31:25,336
I don't know what happened,
but whatever it is,

363
00:31:25,338 --> 00:31:26,838
we can handle it.

364
00:31:30,108 --> 00:31:32,375
Doesn't mean Gabriel
is a bad guy for sure,

365
00:31:34,452 --> 00:31:35,979
but it means something.

366
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:59,151
Ooh, give me-- ah.

367
00:32:00,013 --> 00:32:02,376
I'd like to propose a toast.

368
00:32:05,948 --> 00:32:08,050
I look around this room...

369
00:32:10,384 --> 00:32:12,218
and I see survivors.

370
00:32:14,253 --> 00:32:16,919
<i>Each and every one of you</i>

371
00:32:16,921 --> 00:32:19,286
<i>has earned that title.</i>

372
00:32:21,788 --> 00:32:25,293
- To the survivors.
- Survivors! Cheers!

373
00:32:25,295 --> 00:32:27,761
<i>Cheers.</i>

374
00:32:27,763 --> 00:32:29,395
<i>Survivors.</i>

375
00:32:29,397 --> 00:32:31,096
Is that all you want to be?

376
00:32:34,136 --> 00:32:37,171
<i>Wake up in the morning,</i>
<i>fight the undead pricks,</i>

377
00:32:37,173 --> 00:32:39,743
forage for food, go to sleep
at night with two eyes open,

378
00:32:39,745 --> 00:32:41,747
rinse and repeat?

379
00:32:41,749 --> 00:32:43,815
<i>'Cause you can do that.</i>

380
00:32:43,817 --> 00:32:46,550
I mean, you got the strength.

381
00:32:46,552 --> 00:32:48,519
You got the skill.

382
00:32:49,621 --> 00:32:51,989
<i>Thing is, for you people,</i>

383
00:32:51,991 --> 00:32:56,129
<i>for what you can do,</i>
<i>that's just surrender.</i>

384
00:32:56,131 --> 00:32:59,065
Now, we get Eugene to Washington
and he will make the dead die

385
00:32:59,067 --> 00:33:00,735
and the living will have
this world again.

386
00:33:00,737 --> 00:33:04,172
And that is not a bad takeaway
for a little road trip.

387
00:33:05,843 --> 00:33:07,377
Shh.

388
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:12,148
Eugene, what's in DC?

389
00:33:15,716 --> 00:33:18,283
Infrastructure constructed
to withstand pandemics

390
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:21,121
even of this fubar magnitude.

391
00:33:21,123 --> 00:33:24,522
That means food, fuel, refuge.

392
00:33:26,525 --> 00:33:28,326
Restart.

393
00:33:31,032 --> 00:33:33,867
However this plays out,

394
00:33:33,869 --> 00:33:36,869
however long it takes for the
reset button to kick in,

395
00:33:36,871 --> 00:33:39,772
you can be safe there.

396
00:33:39,774 --> 00:33:42,373
Safer than you've been
since this whole thing started.

397
00:33:45,346 --> 00:33:47,850
<i>Come with us.</i>

398
00:33:47,852 --> 00:33:50,387
Save the world
for that little one.

399
00:33:55,358 --> 00:33:58,023
<i>Save it for yourselves.</i>

400
00:34:00,928 --> 00:34:02,830
<i>Save it for the people</i>
<i>out there...</i>

401
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:08,231
<i>who don't got nothing left</i>
<i>to do except survive.</i>

402
00:34:20,812 --> 00:34:23,211
What was that?

403
00:34:23,213 --> 00:34:27,050
- - I think she knows what I'm about to say.

404
00:34:27,052 --> 00:34:29,718
She's in.
If she's in, I'm in.

405
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,053
We're in.

406
00:34:32,055 --> 00:34:33,856
<i> Yeah.</i>

407
00:34:33,858 --> 00:34:37,929
<i> Let's do it.</i>

408
00:34:45,304 --> 00:34:47,676
Okay.

409
00:34:47,678 --> 00:34:50,110
I'm not letting my brother be the
only one that gets to hold that baby.

410
00:34:51,613 --> 00:34:53,345
Wait.

411
00:34:55,514 --> 00:34:57,081
One more.

412
00:35:33,205 --> 00:35:35,307
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

413
00:35:36,475 --> 00:35:39,011
I was at the prison.

414
00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:41,614
With the Governor.

415
00:35:45,982 --> 00:35:49,150
I didn't know who he was

416
00:35:49,152 --> 00:35:51,520
or what he could do.

417
00:35:51,522 --> 00:35:54,958
And I didn't know
who all of you were.

418
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:05,267
I-- I just didn't
want it to be hidden.

419
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:07,268
That I was there.

420
00:36:13,643 --> 00:36:15,512
You're here with us now.

421
00:36:29,794 --> 00:36:31,862
Thanks for the hospitality.

422
00:36:34,032 --> 00:36:37,566
I'm surprised you let us
drink your communion wine.

423
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:42,768
There isn't anyone left
to take communion.

424
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:47,937
The wine's just wine
until it's blessed.

425
00:36:55,108 --> 00:36:57,309
You're hiding something.

426
00:36:57,311 --> 00:37:01,245
And it's pretty obvious it's
something you can't hide from.

427
00:37:01,247 --> 00:37:03,547
That's your business.

428
00:37:04,883 --> 00:37:07,449
But these people,

429
00:37:07,451 --> 00:37:10,852
these people e my family.

430
00:37:13,158 --> 00:37:15,627
And if what you're hiding
somehow hurts them

431
00:37:15,629 --> 00:37:19,632
in any way, I'll kill you.

432
00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:55,864
What are you doing?

433
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:00,602
I don't know.

434
00:38:03,442 --> 00:38:05,142
Come on.

435
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:23,091
Whoa, whoa! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

436
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:26,559
They got Beth.

437
00:38:27,628 --> 00:38:29,895
Come on.
Come on, get in.

438
00:39:45,965 --> 00:39:47,901
You waking up?

439
00:39:47,903 --> 00:39:51,307
Ah, you're back with us, huh?

440
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:53,810
Good news is...

441
00:39:53,812 --> 00:39:56,412
you're not dead yet.

442
00:39:56,414 --> 00:39:58,615
That's a relief, right?

443
00:39:58,617 --> 00:40:01,582
But try not to read too much
into the word yet there.

444
00:40:01,584 --> 00:40:03,083
It'll just drive you crazy, Bob.

445
00:40:10,823 --> 00:40:12,353
I want to explain
myself a little.

446
00:40:12,473 --> 00:40:17,833
You see, we didn't
want to hurt you...

447
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:21,372
before.

448
00:40:21,621 --> 00:40:26,238
We didn't want to pull you away
from your group or scare you.

449
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,575
These aren't things
that we want to do.

450
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:33,210
They're things we got to do.

451
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:38,982
You and your people
took away our home.

452
00:40:41,953 --> 00:40:43,988
<i>That's fair play.</i>

453
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:48,088
<i>Now we're out here</i>
<i>like everybody else</i>

454
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,855
<i>trying to survive.</i>

455
00:40:51,557 --> 00:40:53,861
<i>And in order to do that,</i>

456
00:40:53,863 --> 00:40:56,297
<i>we have to hunt.</i>

457
00:41:00,968 --> 00:41:03,436
<i>Didn't start that way,</i>

458
00:41:03,438 --> 00:41:05,103
<i>eating people.</i>

459
00:41:05,105 --> 00:41:07,842
<i>It evolved into that.</i>

460
00:41:07,844 --> 00:41:09,709
<i>We evolved.</i>

461
00:41:09,711 --> 00:41:12,079
<i>We had to.</i>

462
00:41:12,081 --> 00:41:16,220
<i>And now we've devolved</i>

463
00:41:16,222 --> 00:41:17,890
<i>into hunters.</i>

464
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:21,361
<i>I told you.</i>

465
00:41:21,363 --> 00:41:24,028
I said it.
Can't go back, Bob.

466
00:41:27,934 --> 00:41:30,965
I just hope you understand

467
00:41:30,967 --> 00:41:35,133
that nothing happening
to you now is personal.

468
00:41:35,135 --> 00:41:37,403
Yeah, you put us
in this situation

469
00:41:37,405 --> 00:41:41,407
and it is almost
kind of a cosmic justice

470
00:41:41,409 --> 00:41:43,875
for it to be you, but...

471
00:41:46,012 --> 00:41:47,879
we would have done this
to anybody.

472
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:52,853
We will.

473
00:41:54,657 --> 00:41:57,796
But at the end of the day,

474
00:41:57,798 --> 00:42:00,767
no matter how much we hate
all this ugly business...

475
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,678
a man's got to eat.

476
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:26,740
If it makes you feel
any better...

477
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:31,307
you taste much better
than we thought you would.

478
00:42:43,997 --> 00:42:54,045
