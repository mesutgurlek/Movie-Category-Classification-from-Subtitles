00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,857
# You saw me standing alone #

00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,974
# Without a dream in my heart #

00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,613

7
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,138
# You heard me saying a prayer for #

8
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,131
# Someone I really could care for #

9
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,938
# And then there suddenly
appeared before me #

10
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,418
# The only one my arms
will ever hold #

11
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:36,853
# I heard somebody whisper
Please adore me #

12
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:42,691

the moon had turned to gold #

That's East Proctor, and all about 'ere
are t'moors. I go this way.

28
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,291
Thanks for the ride, sir.
You have lovely sheep.

29
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,379
Boys, keep off the moors. Stick to
the roads, and the best of luck.

30
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,139
Thanks again. I'm gonna miss you.

31
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,057
Bye, girls.

32
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,937
- Are you cold?
- Yeah.

33
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,379
Good.

34
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,650
- Jack!
- David.

35
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,137
- You're not havin' a good time, are ya?
- Oh, I don't know. I mean, look around.

36
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,490
Isn't this a fun place?

37
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,009
- Well, I like it here.
- Right.

38
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,132
- Northern England first. Italy later.
- Right.

39
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,933
- I mean, we've got three months.
- Right.

40
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,740
Those sheep shit on my pack.

41
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,895
You think she'll meet me in Rome?

42
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,410
I think Debbie Klein's a mediocre person
with a good body.

43
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,612
There's nothin' mediocre
about Debbie Klein's body.

44
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,298
She's a jerk.

45
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,376
You're talkin' about the woman I love.

46
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,458
I'm talkin' about a girl you
wanna fuck. So gimme a break?

47
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,016
Well... I have to make love to her.

48
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,974
It's really very simple.
She has no choice.

49
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,969
It just fascinates me how much energy
you spend on somebody so dull.

50
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,809
There's nothin' dull about that body.

51
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,330
We've known Debbie, what?
Since the eighth grade?

52
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,735
How many years of foreplay is that?

53
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,848
She says she likes me too much.

54
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,455
What are you worried about
Debbie Klein for, anyway?

55
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,571
There are gonna be plenty
of girls on this trip.

56
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,930
Yeah, we're off to a great start.

57
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,449
- Say "knock, knock".
- Knock, knock.

58
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,377
- Who's there?
- Who?

59
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,297
- Don't you get it?
- What?

60
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,253
You don't get that joke?
All right, I'll try another.

61
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,416
- Say "knock, knock".
- What?

62
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,371
- Say "knock, knock".
- Who's there?

63
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,493
- No, no, no. You say "knock, knock".
- Knock, knock.

64
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,019
- Who's there?
- Who?

65
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,858
- No...
- [LAUGHTER]

66
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,853
You're right, it is a pub.

67
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,416
Whaddaya say we go in
for a little food? Drink? Rest?

68
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,417
"The Slaughtered Lamb"?

69
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,488
That's kinda strange.

70
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,215
- Where's the lamb?
- Probably inside getting cold. Come on.

71
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,934
No, really. What kinda ad
is that for a pub?

72
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,096
I don't know.
Would you rather the Hilton?

73
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,657
All right. But, whatever happens,
it's your fault.

74
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,013

76
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,808
Hello.

77
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,929
Hi.

78
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,812
Nice to see you.

79
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,211
It's very cold outside.
May we come in?

80
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,699
- Yes, do you have any hot soup?
- No.

81
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,254
- Do you have any coffee, then?
- No.

82
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,177
Do you have any, uh, hot chocolate?

83
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,212
We've spirits and beers. If it's something 
hot you want, then you can have tea.

84
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,137
- Then you have tea.
- No.

85
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,332
- Oh.
- But I can make some for you, if you like.

86
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,257
Oh, yes, please.

87
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,689
- Nice-lookin' group.
- At least it's warm in here.

88
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,011
Look at that.

89
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,813
- What about it?
- It's a five-pointed star.

90
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,769
Maybe the owners are from Texas.

91
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,813
- Remember the Alamo.
- I beg your pardon?

92
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,852
- Oh, he was just joking.
- Joking?

93
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,815
I remember The Alamo. I saw it once
in London, in Leicester Square.

94
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,252
She means in the cinema...
that film with John Wayne.

95
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,814
[DAVID] Oh, yeah, of course.

96
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,770
Checkmate.

97
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,370
Right. With Laurence Harvey.
Everybody dies in it. Very bloody.

98
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,968
Bloody awful if you ask me.

99
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,171
'Ere, Gladys, Tom.
Did you hear the one about that...?

100
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,291
[EVERYONE GROANS]

101
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,650
Let me speak!

102
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,738
- Ask him what the candles are for.
- You ask him.

103
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,694
All right, then, I shan't tell it.
No, no, you've had your chance.

104
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,654
It's a pentangle, a five-pointed star.
It's used in witchcraft.

105
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,216
Lon Chaney Jr at Universal Studios
said that's the mark of the Wolf Man.

106
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,413
And you want me to ask them if they're
burning candles to ward off monsters.

107
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,496
- Right.
- Wrong.

108
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,172
All right, then!
There was this aeroplane...

109
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,929
..over the Atlantic
on its way to New York,...

110
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,939
..and it was full of men
from the United Nations.

111
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,132
- Go on, ask him.
- You ask him.

112
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,139
So halfway over the ocean
the engines run low on petrol.

113
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,694
So they have to lighten the plane.

114
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,778
So they heave out all the baggage,
but it's still too heavy.

115
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,688
So they chuck out all the seats,
but it's still too heavy.

116
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,969
Finally, this Frog, he steps up, shouts
"Vive la France", and leaps out.

117
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:27,016
Then an Englishman, he steps up, shouts
"God save the Queen", and he leaps out.

118
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,571
But the plane is still too heavy.

119
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,375
So the Yank delegate,
from Texas, he steps up, shouts:

120
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,249
"Remember the Alamo",
and chucks out the Mexican!

121
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,369
Remember the Alamo.

122
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,817
Excuse me.
What's that star on the wall for?

123
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,970
You... made me miss.

124
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,858
Sorry.

125
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,494
I've never missed that board before.

126
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,819
- Jack, we'd better go.
- Are you kidding? I'm starved.

127

There's no food 'ere.

[THUNDER]

129
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,334
- Shall we go, Jack?
- Apparently so.

130
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,850
- You can't let them go.
- How much do we owe you?

131
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,096
Nothing, lads.

132
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,529
Go. God be with you.

133
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,889
Uh, thank you.

134
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,932
Wait! You just can't let them go.

Go. Stay on the road.

136

Beware the moon, lads.

Yeah.

140

- What the hell was that all about?
- I don't know.

Let's go up the road and see if
there's an inn or somethin'.

00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,170
- "Beware the moon"?
- Yeah, Jack, but come on. I'm freezing.

143
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,929
- Where the hell are we going?
- Away from The Slaughtered Lamb.

144
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,335
Where to now, Kessler?
The Duck's Breath?

145
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,179
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sure
we'll find something else.

It was, man.
But, boy, they could play darts.

You can't let them go.

Should the world know our business?

- It's murder, then!
- Then murder it is.

- What do you think was wrong?
- I have no idea.

154
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,730
Maybe that pentangle
was for something supernatural.

Oh, I see.

00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,498
Uh, sorry. Sorry.

317
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,817
Has Mr Kessler said anything
regarding the attack on the moors?

318
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,090
- [INTERCOM]
- Excuse me. Yes?

319
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,098
- Roger Matheson, Doctor.
- I'm not here.

320
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,255
He's on the telephone.

321
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,338
Tell him I'm out. Tell him I've
passed away - an old war wound.

322
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,688
[CLATTERING]

323
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,898
Just tell him I'm dead!
And no more calls.

324
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,212
[CLATTERING]

325
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,375
I'm sorry if I conflict
with your report, Inspector,...

326
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,616
..but Jack and I were not
attacked by a man!

327
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,334
- Hmm. So you've said.
- He may have a point, sir.

328
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,858
Two strong boys would be able to defend
themselves against one man.

329
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,174
Sergeant McManus,...

330
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,610
..are you suggesting that David and Jack
were attacked by some animal,...

331
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,097
..and that the officialdom of East Proctor
has conspired to keep it a secret?

332
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,849
We've an autopsy report on the murderer,
shot in the act by the local police.

333
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,016
We have two witnesses to the crime.

334
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,932
You'll forgive me, Mr Kessler,
if I consider your testimony...

335
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,893
..as coming from someone who
has gone through a terrible shock.

336
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,170
Inspector, the boy seems
all right to me, and...

337
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,212
And what, Sergeant?

338
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,458
- And I don't rightly know, sir.
- That is precisely my point.

339
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,374
David, as far as we're concerned,
the matter is now closed.

340
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,539
We will trouble you no further.
Good day. Doctor.

341
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,494
- There were witnesses?
- So they said.

342
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,852
How could there have been witnesses?
It was so dark.

343
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,572
We were running, and I fell.

344
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,498
Jack went to help me,
and this thing came from nowhere.

345
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,214
I don't know what they're talkin' about.

346
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,015
In time I'm sure
it'll all come back to you.

347
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,970
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity
I'm beginning to worry about.

348
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,056
- Hello, Benjamin.
- No.

349
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,977
- No what?
- No.

350
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,809
Well, all right, then, be like that.
Here. Swallow this.

351
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,377
Want some water?

352
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,850
- Feeling better?
- No!

353
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,249
What a lot of lovely comics
you've got.

354
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,575
- Do you like them?
- No.

355
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,497
Right.

356
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,739
How's the patient in 21?

357
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,418
- Yes, yes, yes.
- How did he look?

358
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,814
What do you mean?

359
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,010
Does he seem depressed?
Will he eat his food?

360
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,735
I am an orderly, not a bleeding
psychiatrist. I push things around.

361
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,169
- What happens then I don't know.
- Thank you.

362
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,010
- Mr Kessler.
- Yes?

363
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,014
- You haven't eaten your lunch.
- Well, I'm not very hungry, thank you.

364
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,452
- I'm afraid you have to eat something.
- What?

365
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,491
You have to eat something.

366
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,735
No, really. Thanks. I'm not hungry.

367
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,259
You put me in an awkward position,
Mr Kessler.

368
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,335
How'd I do that?

369
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,257
You're to take these after you've eaten.

370
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:10,259
What sort of nurse would I be if I failed
in so simple a task as handing out pills?

371
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,933
- Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
- Sorry.

372
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,488
- Aw, come on, Nurse Price.
- You can call me Alex.

373
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,690
Come on, Alex.

374
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,496
Shall I be forced
to feed you, Mr Kessler?

375
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,580
You can call me David.

376
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,339
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?

377
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,050
This is absurd. I'm not hungry.
I don't want any food.

378
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,498
Right.

379
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,134
Let's try a little harder, shall we?

380
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,216
Would you gimme a break?

381
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,098
Will I have to take such drastic
action again, David?

382
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,731
You've never had bad dreams before?

383
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,819
Sure, as a kid, but never so real.
Never so weird.

384
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,615
Did you get a good look
at the man who attacked you?

385
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,379
Doctor, I told you. It wasn't a man.

386
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,333
It was an animal.
A big wolf or something.

387
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,295
- A rabid dog.
- Let's have a look, shall we?

388
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,778
Dr Hirsch, I know I was traumatised,
but Jack was torn apart.

389
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,098
I saw him. A man can't do that
to someone with his bare hands.

390
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,132
You'd be surprised what horrors
a man is capable of.

391
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,649
- Did you see Jack?
- No.

392
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,578
In fact, your wounds had been dressed
before you arrived here.

393
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,890
Did you talk to the police
in East Proctor?

394
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,215
Did the cops go to
The Slaughtered Lamb?

395
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,659
I really don't know.

396
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,294
Then why the hell are you
so quick to disbelieve me?

397
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:35,013
- You think I'm crazy.
- David, please. The police are satisfied.

398
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:40,214
And if there were a monster roaming
around, we'd have seen it on the telly.

399
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:46,537
You'll be leaving this hospital in three
or four days. Please, remain sane.

400
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,576
At least until you're
no longer our responsibility.

401
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,816
Dr Hirsch.

402
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,336
I'd rather not be by myself.

403
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,258
I'll send someone in
to keep you company.

404
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,488
You're a very beautiful girl.

405
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,257
I thought you were asleep.

406
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,851
I was.

407
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,658
Shall I read to you?

408
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,738
Yeah, OK.

A Connecticut Yankee

410
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,815
By Samuel L Clemens.

411
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,374
This is after the preface
but before chapter one:

412
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,170
"A Word of Explanation."

413
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,053
"It was in Warwick Castle that I came
across the curious stranger...

414
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,694
..who I'm going to talk about."

415
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,051
"He attracted me by three things:
his candid simplicity,...

416
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,330
..his marvellous familiarity
with ancient armour,...

417
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,975
..and the restfulness of his company,
for he did all the talking."

418
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,931
"We fell together,
as modest people will,...

419
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,415
..in the tail of the herd
that was being shown through,...

420
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,374
..and he at once began to say things
which interested me."

00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,658
Puppetry is an art form, Piggy.

422
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:18,216
- You call that violence "art"?
- Well, violence belongs with puppetry.

He is hitting her.

424
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,251
That's Punch andJudy.
They've always been violent.

425
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,848
- Punch andJudy?
- It's a good, aggressive behaviour.

426
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,379
Better than my act?

Hello. Have you been up long?

438
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,334
I've just had a nightmare.

439
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,133
Not to worry. I've just the thing.

No. I can't take this.

Am I asleep now, or awake or what?

..but I thought you'd be glad to see me.

David! You're hurting my feelings.

455

Hurting your feelings?

456
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,055
Has it occurred to you
that it might be unsettling...

00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,535
..to see you rise from the grave
to visit me?

Sorry to be upsetting you,
David, but I had to come.

459

Aren't you supposed to be
buried someplace in New York?

460
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,210
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral.

I was surprised at how many came.

462
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,332
Why should you be surprised?
You were a well-liked person.

Sit down, Alex.

I was in East Proctor today.

- I'm concerned about David.
- Yes, sir.

There's a full moon.
Where is he?

795
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:54,250
- He's at my flat.
- What's the number?

796
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,291
- I'm off at midnight...
- Your number.

01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:42,130
..has David persisted
in his werewolf fantasies?

802
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,494
Dr Hirsch, what's wrong?
Is this more serious than I know?

803
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:49,568
I tried to investigate the attack.
There are no records.

804
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:54,251
Case was closed.
Now they've "misplaced" the file.

805
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:57,292
David's lacerations were dressed
before he arrived here.

806
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:00,730
Yet, supposedly, no other doctor
examined him before I did.

So, I went to the pub
in East Proctor today,...

..where I was convinced of two things:

810
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:12,969
They were lying. There were no
witnesses, no escaped lunatic.

the truth of what actually happened out there.

David has suffered a severe trauma.

I myself witnessed some form of
mass neurosis in East Proctor.

815

If the villagers believe Jack Goodman
was killed by a werewolf,...

816
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,408
..why shouldn't David?

817
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:35,249
And if he survived
an attack by a werewolf,...

818
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:38,816
..wouldn't he himself become a werewolf
at the next full moon?

819
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:43,331
Oh, I don't mean running about on
all fours and howling at the moon,...

820
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:46,930
..but in such a deranged state he might
harm himself. Perhaps other people.

01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:50,935
- What shall we do?
