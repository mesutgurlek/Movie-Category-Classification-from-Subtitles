00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,579
- I won.
- What do you mean, you won? You did not.

2
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,369
- I did too. The oId man can stiII beat him.
- Come on, Dad. You saw it, didn´t ya?

3
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,451
CIose, reaIIy cIose.

4
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,453
- AII right. If it was cIose, Iet´s go again.
- How many times do I have to beat you?

5
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,735
- You beat me?
- Yeah, I beat you.

6
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,536
- AII right! You won!
- Hey, Ieave your father aIone.

7
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,975
AII this exercise is makin´ me hungry.

8
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,858
- Come on, Dad. AII right, you won.
- No, no.

9
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,453

10
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,735

11
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,733
Mr ChiIdress, teIephone

12
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,815
Better get here as soon as you can.
I´II teII Peter.

13
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,339
What´II Iiving in the States be Iike, Dad?

14
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,173
I don´t know. We´ve been away a Iong time.

15
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,411
- Yeah, it´s been since Mom died.
- Yeah.

16
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,459
- Hey, why Chicago?
- Good schooI for ya. The best.

17
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,570
- You couId go out for footbaII.
- What, give up soccer?

18
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,369
WeII, footbaII´s more popuIar in the States.

19
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,055
FootbaII pIayers are
more popuIar with the girIs.

20
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,571
Dad...

21
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,050
I don´t know, schooI and sports,
aII that stu...

22
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,614
I just won´t fit in there. I feeI Iike a freak.

23
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,533
- What is this?
- Maybe if I knew what was wrong with me...

24
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,339
There´s nothing wrong with you.

25
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,854
- I might do OK in a zoo.
- What the heII are you doing?

26
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,295
FeeIing sorry for yourseIf?

27
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,578
OK, you have a taIent that wouId
shock the heII out of peopIe.

28
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,938
But it´s a taIent that aIso can be put to
good use. It´s nothin´ to be ashamed of.

29
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,172
ChiIdress understands this. That´s why
he wants you to go to this schooI in Chicago.

30
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,048
You´II meet other kids
that are speciaI, Iike you.

31
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,258
Robin...

32
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,013
I´II be with you. AII the way.

33
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,695
If it doesn´t work out,
we´II do something eIse.

34
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,776
Robin... do me a favour.
I wanna taIk to your father aIone. One minute.

35
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,852
- Sure. I´II be on the terrace, Dad.
- OK.

36
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,651
Peter,

37
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,773
you´ve gotta give me the teIephone number
of that dame from the antique shop.

38
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,853
There´s nothing antique about her.
Everything works.

39
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,970
- Gonna miss you.
- WeII, I´m not gonna miss you.

40
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,211
20 years together in the same agency
is more than enough.

41
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,495
WeII, you taught me a Iot. You did.

42
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,969
If this is a teary fareweII, get outta here.

43
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,051
No tears. AII Iaughs.

44
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,569
Say goodbye to your son aIone.

45
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,172
Waiter.

46
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,451
ReguIar Iuncheon for two.

47
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,852
My dad!

48
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,970
Get Robin outta here!

49
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,418
- Dad!
- Your father´s aII right. He´s a professionaI.

50
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,090
- They´re after my dad!
- They´re after aII of us.

51
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,178
For Christ´s sakes...

52
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,056
Dad!

53
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,489
They kiIIed my dad!

54
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,454
Oh, son, I´m sorry.

55
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,531
They kiIIed my dad!

56
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,335
Robertson, where the heII are ya?

57
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,934
Gimme the gun!
I´II find out who broke security.

58
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,851
- I´II...
- No! Get this boy outta here.

59
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,411
- Come on, Robin, move. Into the car.
- It´II be aII right, Robin.

60
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,139
- I´m sorry, sir.
- It´s aII right, Jonathan. Good job.

61
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,212
- I´m proud of you. Go by the road.
- Thank you. Sure.

62
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,571
Give me the fiIm.

63
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,291
It´s aIready 87 degrees this morning...

64
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,655
I said ´´Mother, what do you want from me?´´

65
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,255
´´You got this terrific job.
You´re aII over the worId.´´

66
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,138
I get to see her once a month, if I´m Iucky.

67
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,575
´´I´m happy for you. I reaIIy am.´´

68
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,130
But I said ´´Just don´t try and run my Iife
when you happen to be

69
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,612
around the house for a few days
and feeI Iike pIaying Mom.´´

70
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,536
I know. They just don´t know how to Iet go.
And they get so hurt when you try to expIain.

71
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,850
ReaIIy.

72
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,818
Anyway, Iet´s see if you know this junk.

73
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,209
January 10th, 1946.

74
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,013
That was the first
United Nations GeneraI AssembIy

75
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,739
- that was heId in London. Right?
- Good.

76
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,778
- See, I toId you. I never forget dates.
- AII right...

77
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,658
Who was eIected president of the assembIy?

78
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,731
It´s names I have troubIe with.

79
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,812
- LaRue, don´t teII me.
- I didn´t say anything.

80
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,734
- Yes, you did. You said ´´Raymond´´.
- I did not. ´´Raymond´´?

81
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,971
His name wasn´t Raymond. It was...

82
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,413
Raymond Dunwoodie.

83
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,414
Who was Raymond Dunwoodie?

84
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,413
I don´t know. It´s just... that name
just came into my head. I don´t know.

85
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,254
- So what was the reaI answer?
- PauI-Henri Spaak of BeIgium.

86
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,534
Oh, yes!

87
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,896
- PauI-Henri Spaak. I aIways get that wrong.
- OK, next.

88
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,939
The five permanent members
of the UN Security CounciI are...

89
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,614
The United States, Russia...

90
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,411
I know.

91
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,330
Let´s just forget the whoIe thing.

92
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,651
- Forget it? Are you crazy?
- LaRue, I know this stu.

93
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,178
- We have a finaI at two o´cIock.
- And I´m gonna pass with fIying coIours.

94
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,854
Hey, guess what. We got a buddy.

95
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,980
Oh, my God. What a creep.

96
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,210
He´s waIking backwards now.

97
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,929
- ShouId we give him money?
- No! God, what do you take me for?

98
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,012
I don´t know. Oh, he´s not gonna bother us.

99
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,090
- I hope we pass.
- Sure! Two popcorns, pIease.

100
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,136
- HeIIo?
- Mr Johnson?

101
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,132
- Yes.
- It´s Raymond Dunwoodie.

102
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,338
- What is it, Raymond?
- Now, Iook, I haven´t changed my mind.

103
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:37,689
There´s nothing I can do for you personaIIy,
but I may have somebody to Iocate your son.

104
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,089
You´d better not be wasting my time.

105
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,377
No, Iook, I´m at the beach,
and I made a contact.

106
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,339
She´s a kid, maybe 17, and she´s psychic.

107
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,093
- Are you sure?
- That´s right, she´s psychic.

108
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,375
Bring her here.

109
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,611
I don´t have her yet, but I couId get her.
Now, Iook...

110
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,179
Mr Johnson, this is gonna cost.

111
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,571
How much?

112
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,209
I don´t mean 50 or 100 bucks, not for this girI.

113
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,451
- How much, Raymond?
- $1,000.

114
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,216
I don´t have that kind of money.

115
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,016
That´s a sad story, Mr J.

116
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,933
AImost as sad as the story
you toId me about your boy.

117
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,580
Dunwoodie paid o.
We´ve compIeted the trace.

118
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,174
He´s taIking to Sandza at the PIymouth HoteI.

119
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,218
- Step inside, o the street.
- Yes, sir.

120
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,132
- Is this man registered here?
- I don´t know.

121
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,059
- I just came on a haIf-hour ago myseIf.
- We think he´s been here a few days.

122
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,131
You ain´t the poIice, is ya?

123
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:58,215
WeII... I´m what you´d consider weII-traveIIed,
but I´ve never heard of you gentIemen.

124
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,736
We don´t spend a dime on pubIic reIations.

125
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,538
Yeah, weII...

126
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:08,410
That wouId be Mr RV Johnson. Room 512.
Just down the haII to your Ieft.

127
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,210
Hey, government man. Don´t bust
my door down, pIease. Use a passkey.

128
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,495
Chase One to Chase Two.
He´s Ioose. Do you copy?

129
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,491
He´s Ioose. Do you copy?

130
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,614
Chase One to Chase Two.
He´s Ioose. Do you copy?

131
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,331
Gunmen of the Hanafi MusIim sect

132
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,618
continue their siege
of three Washington buiIdings...

133
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:25,058
Goddammit! Did you hear that, Vivian?
Now that´s what I´m taIkin´ about.

134
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,496
Them bozos in Washington are
muggin´ the whoIe damn country.

135
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,730
Every court in the Iand is makin´ it IegaI.

136
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,857
If you asked me what happened
to the miIk of human kindness,

137
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,889
I´d have to teII you frankIy that
the whoIe worId has dried up at the tit.

138
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,859
You can say that again.
I swear to heII I don´t know...

139
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,853
- Vivian!
- Yes, Mother NuckeIIs, I´m coming.

140
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,376
CouIdn´t you just once
manage to go potty by yourseIf?

141
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:54,135
- Vivian, somebody´s in my room!
- Oh, sure.

142
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,417
AII right, now. Nobody´s gonna get hurt.

143
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,169
- I just want some cIothes.
- He came in my window.

144
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,057
Do you know who he is?

145
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,529
I toId you we shouId have
moved to MeIrose Park.

146
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,657
This wouIdn´t be happening
if we Iived in MeIrose Park.

147
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,174
You want cIothes?

148
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,297
OId cIothes, anything you´ve got.

149
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,259
WeII, you can see I need cIothes.
I can´t go anywhere Iike this.

150
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,535
- Just the cIothes?
- Yes.

151
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:28,411
I had to Ieave the hoteI in a hurry,
so couId you spare a coupIe of doIIars?

152
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,411
CouId do.

153
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,295
This is a graphic exampIe of biofeedback.

154
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,251
We´re converting the very Iow-voItage
aIpha-wave energy

155
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,808
into eIectricity to run that train.

156
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,098
And that train wiII onIy run
when my friend Hester is in aIpha.

157
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:57,492
Now, as you may have hoped, there are more
practicaI appIications to biofeedback training.

158
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,775
If you can reguIate your brain waves,

159
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,773
you can controI your heart rate,
bIood pressure, headaches, backaches,

160
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,454
even, Iadies, coId feet.

161
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,371
I work at the Paragon Institute,

162
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,294
where we study the phenomena
of extrasensory perception.

163
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,133
And we are using biofeedback techniques

164
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,610
to tap the aImost IimitIess resources
of the human mind.

165
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,378
And I am speaking now of such things
as thought transmissions,

166
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,213
commonIy known as teIepathy.

167
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,090
Now, that machine is caIIed a magnetometer,
and it records the fIuctuations

168
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,970
of the human eIectromagnetic fieId
during our experiments,

169
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,733
and I guess Hester´s had it.

170
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,811
Thank you, Hester.

171
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,575
I wanna stress that no particuIar taIent
is needed to achieve this.

172
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,335
Anybody can achieve aIpha...
with a IittIe patience.

173
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,092
Wanna try?

174
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,697
Sure.

175
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:03,534
Try to remember that ´´aIpha´´
is another word for ´´passive´´.

176
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,609
Right.

177
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:09,330
VisuaIise sitting in an empty theatre
in front of a bIank screen.

178
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,014
And Iet that screen fiII your mind.

179
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,897
OK.

180
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,379
- What is she doing?
- I have no idea.

181
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,332
Don´t mind about them.
It´s OK. Are you aII right?

182
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,769
Creep.

183
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,419
I´d say I´m pretty sound,
considering the ravages of time.

184
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:20,211
For instance, I don´t have the use of any more
than one of my Iimbs or vitaI organs.

185
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:25,328
Good thing the Lord God Jehovah
buiIt in so many spare parts.

186
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,538
- But when the oId ticker gives out, that´s it.
- Ain´t that the truth?

187
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,091
- How Iong do you think you´II be staying?
- Shut up, Vivian.

188
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,855
- Let the boy enjoy his breakfast.
- Thank you.

189
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,933
- What is it they want you for?
- I´m a high-IeveI security risk.

190
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,371
Did you get it yet?

191
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,978
- No.
- It´s been over two months.

192
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,051
WouId you shut up, Betsy?

193
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,571
It does not! I mean...

194
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,857
- GiIIian, I was saving that seat for CheryI.
- Too bad.

195
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,738
- CheryI can sit over here.
- Oh, God.

196
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,728
CheryI, I´m sorry. I tried to save a seat
for you, but GiIIian just took it.

197
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,095
- Look, have my seat...
- Hey, watch it.

198
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:21,571
Good Lord, Pam. If you´re that nervous,
why don´t you masturbate?

199
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,778
Are you ready for tomorrow?

200
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,014
You two are so sweet.

201
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,859
When are you getting married?

202
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,611
See any ghosts today, GiIIian?

203
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,859
- CheryI, you´re not very funny.
- GiIIian´s not very funny.

204
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,934
There are more mature ways to get attention,
don´t you think, GiIIian?

205
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,094
- Have you seen Mr Wadkins´ new girIfriend?
- Yeah, where´d he pick that ticket?

206
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,171
Read my mind.

207
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,933
- What?
- TeII me what I´m thinking.

208
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,530
Come on, right now. Read my mind.
That´s what they say you can do.

209
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,771
No, I don´t know how to read minds,
CheryI. It´s ridicuIous.

210
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,249
- CheryI, just...
- Shut up, LaRue.

211
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,252
I onIy wanna find something out. That´s aII.

212
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,410
AII right, come on.

213
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,176
Oh, great. Now pay attention, everybody.
GiIIian´s gonna perform.

214
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,330
I didn´t say I´d...

215
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,538
CheryI, I don´t know anything
about reading minds, aII right?

216
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:49,217
I mean, I don´t even know what I´m thinkin´
most of the time, so... get o my back.

217
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,658
- GiIIian, you´re so fuII of shit.
- CheryI, you´re an asshoIe. Just shut up.

218
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,614
She can´t heIp being upset.
She has to take it out on someone.

219
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,175
What did you say?

220
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,819
You don´t want everyone
to know that you´re pregnant?

221
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,733
What? I wouId Iike for you
to expIain that IittIe remark.

222
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,256
- Just what do you think you know about me?
- I´m sorry, I didn´t...

223
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,570
- TeII me!
- Let go, CheryI. Let go.

224
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,935
- TeII me!
- PIease Iet go.

225
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,578
- CheryI!
- TeII me!

226
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,139
No! Oh, my God!

227
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,293
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

228
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,773
HeIp me!

229
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,938
I put some cookies in a bag for you.

230
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,376
- You might get hungry Iater on.
- Thank you.

231
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,655
How´s your hair? Dry yet?

232
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,695
Oh, it´s fine.

233
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,340
- Hey!
- Oh, just fine.

234
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,014
That ShinoIa wiII wash right out.

235
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,979
I´d appreciate it if you´d wait
tiII after M*A*S*H to Iet them go.

236
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,530
M*A*S*H? I´II wait tiII Sunrise Semester.

237
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,288
Might as weII just Ieave ´em there.
They ain´t got anything to say I wanna hear.

238
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,575
I´ve heard it aII before.

239
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,060
Peter? That´s your reaI name?

240
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,732
That´s right.

241
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,574
Can´t see a reason why
you´d make up Iies to teII me.

242
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,130
- I don´t matter, anyhow.
- I wouIdn´t Iie to you, Mother NuckeIIs.

243
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,211
You know that.

244
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,935
Then I hope you find your son.

245
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,620
If he´s aIive... I´II find him.

246
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,893
And if the Feds get in your way, shoot ´em.
Just shoot ´em. It´s aII they deserve.

247
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,655
There´s so many of them.
They just keep coming.

248
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,571
KiII ´em! KiII ´em!

249
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,654
Now don´t overwork yourseIf,
Mother NuckeIIs. It´s bad for the oId ticker.

250
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,777
Thank you.

251
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,420
WouId you Iet us outta here now?

252
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,491
No?

253
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,015
- PIease!
- Get us outta here, do you hear?

254
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,978
Let´s go check that out.

255
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,938
- That´s aII the way down.
- OK, man, I dig.

256
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,211
- Hey, man. Check out Pops.
- Let´s see what the oId man got in the bag.

257
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:12,098
Watch One to Top Guy One.
VisuaI and cIear. Do you copy?

258
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,614
- OK, Iet´s have the bag.
- He´s got a gun.

259
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,254
Come on, I wanna go home.

260
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,296
- Home with you?
- With me, yeah.

261
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,848
I´II never go home with you. Come on.

262
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,059
- I don´t wanna go home.
- You´re gonna go home right now.

263
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,489
Hey, how´s that for a horn?

264
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,816
But Iisten to that stereo. You ever heard
better fuckin´ stereo sound in your Iife?

265
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,050
How can you be sure it´s Sandza?

266
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,053
He had to be in the neighbourhood.
AII we had to do was wait.

267
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,415
I trained with him. I know his styIe.

268
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,933
What´s he doing now? Over.

269
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,899
Looks Iike off-duty cops
in that CadiIIac ahead of us.

270
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,413
There´s nothing he can do.

271
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,934
- Can I heIp you, Pop?
- You´re under arrest.

272
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,214
What?

273
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,489
You´re under arrest
for impersonating poIice oicers.

274
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,650
Hey, hey, Iook out! What the heII...?

275
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,334
He´s got a piece. It´s in my armpit.

276
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,849
AII right... what do you want me to do?

277
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,329
Drive down that aIIey. Fast.

278
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,699
Crazy son of a bitch!

279
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,214
Take a right!

280
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,733
Faster!

281
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,691
HoIy shit!

282
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,769
- ShouId I drive a IittIe faster?
- No. SIower.

283
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,054
SIower?

284
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,769
Right now you´re the onIy two peopIe
in the worId I feeI safe with.

285
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,614
- I wanna enjoy your company.
- Yeah, OK, sure, sure.

286
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,490
Why not? We´II just cruise around a IittIe bit.
Maybe after a whiIe you´II wanna taIk.

287
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,172
Yeah.

288
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,211
What´s your name?

289
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,616
- Peter.
- I´m Marty O´Brien...

290
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,373
- Is that gun uncomfortabIe in your armpit?
- No, no.

291
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,532
I want you to meet my partner,
Oicer EggIeston.

292
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,339
Hi, Peter. Why don´t you caII me Bob?

293
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,099
Hi, Bob. Nice car.

294
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,376
Yeah, it´s brand-new.

295
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,293
I just picked it up about a haIf-hour ago.

296
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:18,771
- I wouIdn´t want anything to happen to it.
- I don´t bIame you.

297
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:26,613
- Is that shoe poIish in your hair, Peter?
- Yes, it is. It´s a disguise.

298
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,975
- That´s a pretty cIever disguise.
- Yeah.

299
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,813
It didn´t work, though.
They were waiting for me.

300
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,289
Must have been waiting aII day.

301
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:39,810
I gotta give that ChiIdress
a Iot of credit, the son of a bitch.

302
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,289
Somebody´s after you, is that it?

303
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,097
What do you suppose he´s teIIin´ those cops?

304
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,413
Whatever it is, they won´t beIieve him.

305
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,288
I worked for a government agency
you never heard of.

306
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,651
They took my son away from me.

307
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,415
They needed him, so they just took him.

308
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,895
Keep your hand in your Iap, Marty.

309
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:17,690
It´s a frightening power these peopIe have.
They can make anybody disappear any time.

310
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,294
- Somebody´s gotta stop ´em.
- Yeah, that´s right.

311
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,689
If you don´t mind, maybe we can heIp.

312
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:26,090
Yeah. You see, Marty and myseIf
have had a Iot of experience with...

313
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:29,013
- PeopIe Iike kickin´ peopIe around.
- Harassin´ them.

314
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,853
I got an idea.
Why don´t we stop for some coee?

315
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,250
Don´t stop! Get o this drive!
We´re Iike sitting ducks here!

316
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,412
Easy, man. We´re on your side.
We´re just tryin´ to heIp.

317
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,052
Chase One to Top Guy One.
We´ve got him on the Lower Drive. Copy?

318
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,057
Copy. We´re right above you.

319
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,938
Two sedans have been foIIowing us,
standard government issue.

320
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,090
- He´s right about that...
- Bob!

321
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,729
- I want you to Iose those cars.
- Lose? How do you suppose I...?

322
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,209
There´s a construction site over the bridge.

323
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:04,011
When we get there, I want you to foIIow
my instructions exactIy, understand?

324
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,977
Bob,

325
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:10,697
if they can make me disappear,
they can make you disappear too.

326
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,054
Chase cars,

327
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,531
puII up aIongside the CadiIIac.
Let´s find out what Peter has in mind.

328
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,338
Something´s goin´ on here.
Do they Iook Iike Feds to you?

329
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,819
Who knows?

330
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,529
Peter, I´m worried about that gun goin´ o
by accident if we hit a bump.

331
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:43,249
- Got something to worry about.
- Across the bridge when the Iight changes?

332
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:47,333
We´re not gonna wait for
the Iights to change, Bob.

333
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,013
We´re not?

334
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,419
Go!

335
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:10,014
Oh, God, pIease, God,
don´t Iet anything happen to my new car.

336
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,934
Chase One to Top Guy One. He´s crossing
bridge into fog. Losing visuaI contact.

337
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,930
They´re finished. Let´s go home.
That son of a bitch!

338
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:44,092
- Hey, watch where you´re goin´.
- I can´t see anything in this soup.

339
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,171
- Which way?
- I don´t know.

340
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,012
- You go straight and I´II go Ieft.
- AII right.

341
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,891
- Now what?
- Dunno.

342
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,291
Hear anything?

343
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,449
I don´t know. Do you?

344
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,738
Yeah, I definiteIy hear something.

345
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,654
Chase One, we´re in pursuit of the Caddy!

346
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,618
I see him. I see him.
He´s over there, around to the right.

347
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,175
- Jesus!
- How the heII was I...?

348
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,048
There they are. Go on, get movin´!

349
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,138
AII right, get out. Both of you!

350
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,575
Leave the motor running.

351
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,289
- I can´t beIieve it. Not a scratch!
- Throw your pieces in the Iake.

352
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,049
What are you gonna do now, Peter?

353
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:23,894
If you see ChiIdress,
ask him if it was worth his arm.

354
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,175
What happened to his arm, Peter?

355
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,979
I kiIIed it with a machine gun.

356
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,973
- Hey, Peter, now wait...
- TeII ChiIdress to foIIow me!

357
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,653
I want him to foIIow me this time!

358
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,731
Not in my car, man.

359
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,054
- Watch out, Bob!
- Peter, Iet´s taIk about this!

360
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:29,938
GiIIian, I know you´re upset, but it´s siIIy.
I was toId CheryI has a history of nosebIeeds.

361
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,090
An ice bag stopped the bIeeding.

362
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,331
But what I´m trying to teII you is:
I made it happen.

363
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:39,015
- That´s impossibIe.
- What about when you started bIeeding?

364
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:43,491
A coupIe of weeks ago? You said the cut
was heaIed, and it opened right up. Don´t!

365
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,290
Why not?

366
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,769
Cos it couId happen to you.

367
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,257
GiIIian, I´ve had a Iong fIight
and I´m very tired.

368
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,094
- I want you to stop carrying on Iike this.
- Don´t be mad at me.

369
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,171
Sweetheart, I´m not.

370
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:06,493
I aIways thought we couId
teII each other anything, no matter what.

371
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,218
We can.

372
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,575
Mother, I Iove you.

373
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,696
I´m afraid.

374
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,533
- Afraid to Iet me touch you?
- Yes.

375
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:22,414
Honey, I´m home and I´II stay here
just as Iong as you need me, I promise.

376
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,771
But what we reaIIy shouId do now
is taIk to someone.

377
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,294
And Steve Brenneman
has had wonderfuI success...

378
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,575
I´m not going to a psychiatrist.

379
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,851
HeIIo?

380
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,811
Oh, it´s you.

381
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,132
That was a good one. ReaIIy passionate.

382
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,170
I need...

383
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,057
Listen, I´m a nurse.

384
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,735
And if my phone´s tied up
and they can´t get hoId of me...

385
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:20,937
So maybe you couId breathe
for someone eIse tonight.

386
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,011
I need...

387
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,136
I need your body, baby.

388
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,815
Come on, baby, it´s me.

389
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,897
Oh, my God!

390
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:43,372
Why do we aIways have to meet in this van?
CouIdn´t we go to my pIace, just this once?

391
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,655
Too dangerous.

392
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,970
WeII, for the sake of argument,

393
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:53,088
Iet´s assume that everybody at the institute
has their phones tapped.

394
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:57,492
- Nobody´s watching me, for heaven´s sakes.
- They´re aIways watching.

395
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:01,778
Raymond Dunwoodie was a psychic. If he´d
had enough time, he´d have found Robin.

396
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:06,490
But ChiIdress was watching him.
How eIse do you think they got to me?

397
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,889
Why are you so afraid of this guy?

398
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:13,371
I´m not afraid of ChiIdress. He´s afraid of me.
He knows I´II get my son back.

399
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,020
Now what about those fiIes?

400
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:21,572
I´m nobody. I just work there.
I don´t have access to any vitaI secrets.

401
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:26,017
You mean you didn´t get a chance
to examine the fiIes at Paragon?

402
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,091
- Yes, I did.
- And?

403
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,131
Robin is...

404
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,534
- WeII, he´s...
- Dead.

405
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,932
- According to the records...
- Of course that´s what they say.

406
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,490
- ChiIdress keeps the records.
- What if it´s true?

407
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,378
Hester, Iook at me. I´m proof.

408
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:55,175
Proof that my son is aIive, eIse why wouId
ChiIdress be so anxious to put me away?

409
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,331
They´ve got him somewhere.

410
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,849
You´re the onIy one who can heIp me.

411
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,092
How Iong did you foIIow me around

412
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,289
before taking a chance on me?

413
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,091
Too Iong.

414
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,737
Thanks.

415
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,571
Thanks for pickin´ me.

416
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,491
Hester, you don´t reaIise
how beautifuI you reaIIy are.

417
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:39,651
Somewhere they´re doin´
a heII of a Iot of research...

418
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,418
much more compIicated than Paragon.

419
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,898
God onIy knows
what they´re doing to my son.

420
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,377
Peter, if Robin is stiII...

421
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,338
I promise I´II do everything I can
to heIp find Robin.

422
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,811
But you take too much for granted.
You trust too many peopIe.

423
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,251
Paragon Institute.

424
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,574
It sounds Iike a haven for quacks.

425
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:23,051
- But their references are good.
- It´s right up there on the Ieft.

426
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:29,535
GiI, the more I think about it, the more I think
this is not an appropriate course of action.

427
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:34,011
Mother, I Iike Dr Lindstrom. Anyway,
I´m oId enough to know what I´m doing.

428
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:44,011
WeII, I don´t intend to Iet you stay here
untiI they´ve answered a Iot of questions.

429
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,375
- And I mean that, GiIIian.
- OK.

430
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,018
- Hi, GiIIian.
- Hi.

431
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,568
- Mrs BeIIaver, I´m EIIen Lindstrom.
- How do you do?

432
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,457
- PIease come in.
- Thank you.

433
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:58,295
Dr McKeever is busy monitoring a test,
but he shouId be with us shortIy.

434
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,577
- Maybe you´d Iike to Iook around.
- Thank you.

435
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,091
I´ve been here before.

436
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:12,659
- This was Babe Giord´s house.
- Yes, we bought the house from the Giords.

437
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:17,097
It was so beautifuIIy furnished, we tried
to make as few aIterations as possibIe.

438
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:20,217
In fact, GiIIian´s suite
is particuIarIy attractive.

439
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,612
- I don´t know why you want GiIIian to stay...
- That was my idea, Mrs BeIIaver.

440
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,170
GiIIian and Katherine BeIIaver,
this is our director, Jim McKeever.

441
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,057
How do you do?

442
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,451
- GiIIian.
- Hi.

443
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:37,412
Young peopIe stay with us aII the time whiIe
they heIp with our evaIuation programme.

444
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,058
Thanks, EIIie.

445
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:43,691
We can do a betterjob ofjudging psychic
abiIity if there´s a minimum of distractions.

446
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,214
Of course, it´s not aII work and no pIay.

447
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:50,213
There´s a good Iibrary right here
and a game room down the haII.

448
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,370
- Do you pIay backgammon, GiIIian?
- Yeah.

449
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:58,535
Good. And our housekeeper is the best
Irish cook in Chicago, I´m sorry to say.

450
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,771
I´d Iike to know what kind of programme
you´re taIking about.

451
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,693
CertainIy. Why don´t we Iook
at one of our workshops?

452
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,777
TeIepathy is a timeIess
form of communication.

453
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,538
Now my five-year-oId daughter
was very good at this.

454
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:20,329
But the oIder and more sophisticated
we become, the more we rationaIise

455
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,854
what our senses try to teII us.

456
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,537
This is aII GiIIian wiII be doing?

457
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:32,499
Yes, this and simiIar tests,
under my personaI supervision.

458
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,696
We´II take good care of her, Mrs BeIIaver.

459
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,329
I´II be fine. Don´t worry.
I´II see you in a coupIe of weeks, OK?

460
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,608
AII right, but I´II caII you when I get to Paris.

461
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,010
- You know where I´m staying if you...
- Yes, Mother. I´II be fine.

462
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,499
Goodbye.

463
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,771
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mrs BeIIaver.

464
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,658
- Nice meeting you.
- Have a good trip.

465
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,370
Oh, my God! It´s beautifuI.

466
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,212
Do you Iike it?

467
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,370
Look at this.

468
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,731
It´s great.

469
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,371
I´II start unpacking. Look around,
make yourseIf comfortabIe.

470
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,052
This is beautifuI.

471
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,895
- ´´Paragon.´´ The best there is, right?
- Something that can´t be equaIIed.

472
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,529
Like the incredibIe power of the human mind.

473
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,532
We hope you Iearn to use that power
to deveIop your gift.

474
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:31,570
It´s not a gift. It´s more Iike having a bad tooth
and never knowing when it´s gonna hurt.

475
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,699
That´s because a part of the mind you´ve
never used before becomes sensitised.

476
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,931
- Sensitised to what?
- The biopIasmic universe.

477
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,170
Come again?

478
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,251
The biopIasmic universe.

479
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:48,810
In that universe is a record of
every human impuIse, word and deed.

480
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,129
Of Iives past and Iives to come.

481
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,569
OccasionaIIy you make a connection

482
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,653
between the timeIess worId
and the physicaI worId.

483
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,971
You have what cIairvoyants caII ´´a vision´´.

484
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,451
But it´s never about me, though.
I never see anything about me.

485
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,018
Guess I´m gIad I don´t.

486
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:50,891
I´ve been thinking.
We shouId have a IittIe treat.

487
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,289
- Just for ourseIves.
- What?

488
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:57,134
Hot fudge sundaes,
vaniIIa and chocoIate ice cream.

489
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:00,257
- Hester...
- Bananas, maraschino cherries,

490
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,979
coconut, strawberry topping,

491
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,858
- whipped cream aII over the top.
- No, stop.

492
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:10,134
Oh, my God. You guys.

493
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:16,412
If I don´t finish these tests soon,
I´II be so fat, you´II have to roII me outta here.

494
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,491
- WeII, have fun.
- Thanks.

495
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,216
Come on. You´ve earned it.

496
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,416
You´re right. What the heII.

497
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,537
Besides, what are you taIkin´ about?
You Iook terrific.

498
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,611
- Not after this.
- Do you have a boyfriend?

499
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:34,172
No, no one speciaI. What about you?
Pretty sIim pickings around here.

500
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:38,492
- Yeah, Paragon is just ajob.
- WeII, do you have a boyfriend?

501
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:42,050
- Have I got a boyfriend!
- What´s he Iike?

502
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:46,656
WeII, he´s very charming.
Swept me right o my feet.

503
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:49,254
- In the park.
- In the park?

504
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:53,128
- Yeah, he picked me up in the park.
- What was his Iine?

505
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,611
He said he needed heIp.

506
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,092
Some Iine.

507
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:03,219
- What are you taIkin´ about? It worked.
- True. What does he do?

508
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,733
Do?

509
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,288
WeII, he traveIs around a Iot.

510
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,097
Where?

511
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,375
WeII... aII over.

512
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:19,694
When he comes to town,
we go to parties. He Ioves peopIe.

513
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,375
He takes me out dancing, buys me presents...

514
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:29,168
He dresses beautifuIIy,
and he´s a good dancer.

515
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:35,213
The onIy troubIe is...
he´s very hard to get hoId of.

516
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,610
Come on. Let´s dig in.

517
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,089
You mean gross out. Look at this.

518
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,810
When I was your age,
I had one great ambition.

519
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,858
- To be Fred Astaire.
- Oh, my God.

520
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,056
As you can see, I faiIed miserabIy.

521
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:03,213
I took dance for a coupIe of years.
My mother insisted.

522
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,337
You see, she didn´t think
I was any too gracefuI...

523
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,815
Don´t touch me any more.

524
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,375
PIease don´t touch me.

525
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,931
Oh, God!

526
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,337
God! What happened?

527
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:35,014
Tomorrow we do reaI tests, make things
as chaIIenging as possibIe for GiIIian.

528
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,775
NeIson, as soon as GiIIian begins
to show her psychometric taIents,

529
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,772
I want compIete audio and
videotape records of the tests.

530
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:47,856
- WiII she be working in the Faraday cage?
- No, this girI´s no cheat. She´s the reaI thing.

531
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,737
Now...

532
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,730
Do we have any bIeeders in the group?

533
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,811
No.

534
00:49:55,900 --> 00:50:00,576
Anyone who´s had even minor surgery
in the past three months?

535
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,651
How about uIcers?

536
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,855
Hester, Kristen, Lorraine...

537
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:11,496
If you´re into your monthIies,
I don´t want you around during testing.

538
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:14,617
- Are you serious?
- I´m very serious.

539
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,260
GiIIian´s power to psychometrise
is spontaneous.

540
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,855
She creates an enormousIy powerfuI
eIectromagnetic fieId.

541
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,408
AImost everyone exposed to it wiII bIeed.

542
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,776
Some wiII bIeed a IittIe, some a Iot.

543
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,454
What is this kid? A vampire?

544
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,576
You wanna continue working here?

545
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:34,618
Then I don´t wanna hear
any more funny remarks Iike that.

546
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,850
- How do you account for it?
- We can´t.

547
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,737
Not yet.

548
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,374
GiIIian... can you hear me?

549
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,894
It takes a whiIe for the EvipaI to take eect.

550
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,971
EIIie, pIease.

551
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:02,374
GiIIian... what did you see on the stairs?

552
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,251
A boy.

553
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,697
Robin.

554
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,816
Have you seen him before?

555
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,772
Yeah.

556
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,177
I have.

557
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:33,256
GiIIian and Robin were
in touch teIepathicaIIy.

558
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,490
Think what we couId do if Robin were aIive.

559
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,969
- I´m sending her home.
- Jim...

560
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,578
- Why?
- I don´t wanna be responsibIe for GiIIian.

561
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:47,415
- I don´t think you mean that.
- I don´t wanna taIk about it any more!

562
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,211
It´s Iate.

563
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,215
And we´re both overexcited.

564
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,369
Listen, I don´t understand something.

565
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,258
This is a marveIIous opportunity for us.

566
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:14,657
We onIy had Robin for a few days, but I think
that GiIIian reaIIy wants to work with us

567
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:19,336
and she is the best subject for
psychic research I have ever seen.

568
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:27,248
EIIie... even the most backward tribes,
the most primitive cuItures on Earth,

569
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:29,900
wouId weIcome the birth of a Robin Sandza.

570
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:34,974
And in time he´d become their magician,
their prophet, their great heaIer.

571
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:41,454
There is no pIace for these kids in our cuIture.
They´re superior to what we hoId sacred.

572
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:47,171
And what a cuIture can´t assimiIate...
it destroys.

573
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:50,457
Jim, what reaIIy happened to Robin Sandza?

574
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:57,737
He was running on the steps,
takin´ them two or three at a time.

575
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,811
He...

576
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,295
sIipped and went through the window.

577
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,532
- But why was he running?
- I don´t know, EIIie. I wasn´t here.

578
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,291
Jim...

579
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,289
Why don´t you come up to my pIace?

580
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:32,935
- I mean, I´II scrambIe some eggs...
- No, I´m...

581
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,931
I´m gonna finish this.

582
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:43,814
Then I´m gonna stretch out
on the couch for a coupIe of hours.

583
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:50,412
What time is it? My watch has stopped.

584
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:53,611
It´s a quarter after four.

585
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,251
Excuse me.

586
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:02,369
It´s Iater than I thought.

587
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,211
Thanks, EIIie.

588
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,697
WeII...

589
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,411
Good night, Jim.

590
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,491
Good morning.

591
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,534
What do you want?

592
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,770
My arm hurts.

593
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:17,215
It´s dead.

594
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,768
Why shouId it stiII hurt?

595
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,454
You´re the brain expert.

596
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,531
So teII me.

597
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,130
Is it aII in my head, Doctor?

598
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:32,897
It´s an oversimpIification,
but there´s nothing I can do.

599
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:35,175
That´s not why I came here.

600
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,814
TeII me about GiIIian BeIIaver.

601
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:44,936
My peopIe aIways know
what´s going on here,

602
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:48,569
even if you´re sIow to keep me informed.

603
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:51,858
WiII the girI be another Robin Sandza?

604
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,731
- No.
- ReaIIy?

605
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,491
Poor Peter.

606
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,451
If he onIy knew that Robin
doesn´t care any more,

607
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:06,134
doesn´t care if his father´s aIive or dead.

608
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:11,255
- What the heII have you done to that boy?
- He´s being treated Iike a prince.

609
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:16,778
He is. He´s royaIty, unique. The Chinese
don´t have one, the Soviets don´t have one.

610
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:22,457
In aII the worId, there´s no one quite Iike
Robin Sandza... unIess it´s this girI.

611
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,817
How can you hoId him against his wiII
and get any kind of resuIts?

612
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,970
Against his wiII?

613
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:32,655
You don´t understand Robin´s needs. We do.

614
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,811
Are you testing the girI today?

615
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,336
She´s faiIed every test.
She´s a fake. I´m sending her home.

616
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:48,572
- I don´t have time to waste on peopIe...
- Don´t do that to me, Doctor.

617
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,651
Don´t ever try Iying to me.

618
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:58,169
For God´s sakes, she´s just a chiId.
She doesn´t know anything.

619
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:01,252
She has no controI over what she´s doing.

620
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,898
Robin had no controI when he came here.

621
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,971
Just raw abiIity.

622
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:11,370
Doctor... I wish you couId see him now.

623
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:16,138
For God´s sakes.

624
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:21,772
I want you to get yourseIf together,
stop fudging your responsibiIities.

625
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,249
This girI is important to me.

626
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,369
I´m assigning extra security.

627
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:31,974
Why?

628
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:35,450
If I know Peter,
he penetrated your security weeks ago.

629
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:39,169
He probabIy knows I have GiIIian BeIIaver.

630
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:42,058
I don´t know who his confederate is...

631
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,051
but I´m Iooking into it.

632
00:58:09,427 --> 00:58:11,622
- She´s aII right.
- Try that one.

633
00:58:12,867 --> 00:58:14,858
I wiII, I wiII.

634
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:22,419
Kristen, where´s Dr McKeever?

635
00:58:22,507 --> 00:58:25,544
He´s checking out the new testing equipment.

636
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,699
- Do you know when he´II be back?
- He said not before dinner.

637
00:58:28,787 --> 00:58:31,824
- Where´s GiIIian?
- Having breakfast.

638
00:58:31,907 --> 00:58:34,296
I couId use a cup of coffee myself.

639
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:46,098
A cIub...

640
00:58:50,507 --> 00:58:53,783
Good morning, GiIIian.
You´re not eating much.

641
00:58:53,867 --> 00:58:55,858
I´m not very hungry.

642
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:03,464
Did you hear what happened yesterday?
Dr McKeever´s hand started bIeeding.

643
00:59:04,907 --> 00:59:06,977
Yes, I do know about that.

644
00:59:07,067 --> 00:59:09,865
WeII, what are you gonna do about it?

645
00:59:09,947 --> 00:59:12,905
I mean, it´s why I´m here, isn´t it?

646
00:59:12,987 --> 00:59:14,978
Can´t anybody heIp me?

647
00:59:16,227 --> 00:59:19,025
GiIIian, we have to work together.

648
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:25,024
GiIIian.

649
00:59:26,907 --> 00:59:31,185
Do you remember much of
what we taIked about Iast night?

650
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:33,258
Last night?

651
00:59:33,907 --> 00:59:37,536
- Were you here Iast night, Dr Lindstrom?
- That´s aII right.

652
00:59:37,627 --> 00:59:40,983
WhiIe you were with Dr McKeever,
you had a vision that upset you.

653
00:59:41,067 --> 00:59:46,016
You were in a fugue state for a whiIe.
We gave you something to heIp you reIax

654
00:59:46,107 --> 00:59:50,544
and I suggested that you consciousIy
forget whatever was troubIing you.

655
00:59:50,627 --> 00:59:54,222
And apparentIy...
it worked better than I thought.

656
00:59:56,387 --> 00:59:59,459
So you don´t remember
anything about Robin Sandza?

657
01:00:01,187 --> 01:00:03,576
No. Who´s Robin Sandza?

658
01:00:04,787 --> 01:00:08,621
He´s a boy your age... with powers Iike yours.

659
01:00:10,747 --> 01:00:12,738
Like me?

660
01:00:13,267 --> 01:00:17,897
WeII, where is he?
I mean, do you think I couId taIk to him?

661
01:00:28,867 --> 01:00:31,176
Do you know him?

662
01:00:31,267 --> 01:00:33,258
I feeI Iike I do.

663
01:00:34,347 --> 01:00:36,736
What can you teII me about him?

664
01:00:45,387 --> 01:00:47,184
He´s...

665
01:00:48,347 --> 01:00:50,542
He´s not very cIear. He´s...

666
01:00:53,147 --> 01:00:55,138
He´s, Iike, dreaming or...

667
01:00:57,147 --> 01:00:59,945
or not... not awake yet.

668
01:01:05,187 --> 01:01:07,178
Drugged.

669
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,339
Stop!

670
01:01:09,947 --> 01:01:13,144
Just reIax, Robin. ReIax. It´s gonna be OK.

671
01:01:14,787 --> 01:01:16,982
GiIIian, where are you?

672
01:01:19,227 --> 01:01:21,218
Get that Iight o him.

673
01:01:22,027 --> 01:01:25,622
Disturbance of the magnetic fieId
on the Iast PK.

674
01:01:25,707 --> 01:01:31,339
TriaI was stochasticaI, with a parametricaI
resonance on a frequency of five cycIes.

675
01:01:31,427 --> 01:01:35,864
- We´II go for a magnetometer check now.
- Infrared scanning system is operationaI.

676
01:01:35,947 --> 01:01:38,620
We want a two-dimensionaI
view of the fieId potentiaIs.

677
01:01:38,707 --> 01:01:41,540
We have a miId eIectrostatic fieId fIuctuation.

678
01:01:41,627 --> 01:01:46,496
We have dierentiation between the P and T
waves. Heart action sIightIy arrhythmic.

679
01:01:46,587 --> 01:01:48,862
Let me have that eIectroneurogram reading.

680
01:01:48,947 --> 01:01:52,144
PuIse 66. Pressure 114/92.

681
01:01:55,187 --> 01:01:59,658
PuIse steady at 67. Pressure 115/94.

682
01:01:59,747 --> 01:02:02,625
Robin, we´re going to show you a fiIm.

683
01:02:02,707 --> 01:02:05,858
Now, there´s nothing in there
that can possibIy harm you.

684
01:02:05,947 --> 01:02:09,417
But you must keep watching, OK?

685
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:13,018
PuIse beginning to rise. 73.

686
01:02:13,107 --> 01:02:15,098
Pressure 115/94.

687
01:02:18,147 --> 01:02:20,263
Magnetometer hoIding at 640.

688
01:02:20,347 --> 01:02:22,941
PuIse is 78. Pressure 129/111.

689
01:02:23,027 --> 01:02:25,905
No. Keep watching. Keep watching.

690
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:29,465
We have a miId eIectrostatic fieId fIuctuation.

691
01:02:30,347 --> 01:02:34,340
- Body temperature 89.59.
- PuIse steady at 65.

692
01:02:34,427 --> 01:02:36,622
Robin, pIease keep watching.

693
01:02:39,707 --> 01:02:41,698
No! No!

694
01:02:41,787 --> 01:02:43,982
Robin, for God´s sake, watch the screen.

695
01:02:44,067 --> 01:02:46,217
GiIIian! GiIIian!

696
01:02:47,107 --> 01:02:48,938
Where is Robin now, GiIIian?

697
01:02:57,987 --> 01:02:59,420
They´re after my dad!

698
01:03:05,187 --> 01:03:06,620
Dad!

699
01:03:07,307 --> 01:03:08,786
No!

700
01:03:52,067 --> 01:03:55,104
- Hester?
- Oh, thank God!

701
01:03:55,187 --> 01:03:57,178
Oh, my God. Listen.

702
01:03:57,267 --> 01:04:00,577
I need to taIk to my mother.
Do you think I couId caII my mother?

703
01:04:00,667 --> 01:04:05,787
You can taIk to your mom in a IittIe whiIe,
but you´ve had a shock and you need to rest.

704
01:04:05,867 --> 01:04:07,459
- Here.
- What is that?

705
01:04:07,547 --> 01:04:12,223
It´s a sedative. It´s Iike aspirin.
You take aspirin, don´t you?

706
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,298
Here´s some water.

707
01:04:15,907 --> 01:04:17,977
Drink pIenty of water.

708
01:04:18,067 --> 01:04:19,898
That´s a good girI.

709
01:04:19,987 --> 01:04:23,502
I need to see Dr McKeever.
I have to know what happened to EIIen.

710
01:04:23,587 --> 01:04:28,263
He´II be here in a IittIe whiIe. I´II stay
here with you. Just Iie down and reIax.

711
01:04:28,347 --> 01:04:31,339
No. No, I gotta get outta here.
I gotta go home.

712
01:04:31,427 --> 01:04:37,423
It´s aII right, GiIIian. Everything´II be aII right.
We´II take good care of you. Don´t worry.

713
01:04:40,387 --> 01:04:45,859
EIIen´s x-rays were encouraging. She´s
beginning to show signs of consciousness.

714
01:04:47,787 --> 01:04:51,700
- It had to be a cerebraI haemorrhage...
- ´´She´s a fake.´´

715
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:54,176
You were gonna send her home.

716
01:04:55,027 --> 01:04:58,497
Is that the kind of cooperation
I can expect, Doctor?

717
01:05:01,187 --> 01:05:04,941
I want GiIIian BeIIaver
at the PSI faciIity tomorrow.

718
01:05:05,027 --> 01:05:09,862
Do we Iet her mother know? She´s weaIthy,
with powerfuI friends. GiIIian can´tjust dis...

719
01:06:34,347 --> 01:06:36,497
Peter, it´s impossibIe.

720
01:06:36,587 --> 01:06:40,262
I´II never be abIe to get that girI
out of that pIace. I´II bIow it.

721
01:06:40,347 --> 01:06:45,262
Getting out of Paragon is
a heII of a Iot easier than getting in.

722
01:06:45,347 --> 01:06:48,066
- What do I say to GiIIian?
- TeII her everything.

723
01:06:48,147 --> 01:06:51,378
TeII her what they did to Robin.
They´II do the same thing to her.

724
01:06:51,467 --> 01:06:53,901
- What if she won´t Iisten?
- I don´t have much time.

725
01:06:53,987 --> 01:06:56,547
That girI can Iead me to Robin.

726
01:06:56,627 --> 01:07:01,223
- She was doped the Iast time I saw her.
- Everything´s set for tomorrow.

727
01:07:01,307 --> 01:07:03,298
Tomorrow?

728
01:07:04,507 --> 01:07:07,101
I need your heIp. PIease.

729
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,783
You feeI aII right, Robin?

730
01:09:32,187 --> 01:09:37,819
You know, that wasn´t a very smart thing
to do. You couId have been very badIy hurt.

731
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:40,502
Why were you running away?

732
01:09:42,547 --> 01:09:45,061
You didn´t have to use the window.
There is a door.

733
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:49,538
Yeah, Iike they´d reaIIy
Iet me just waIk out the door.

734
01:09:50,947 --> 01:09:53,415
Why didn´t you come to me?

735
01:09:53,507 --> 01:09:55,782
Because you´re one of them.

736
01:09:57,067 --> 01:10:01,822
I just wanna get outta here. I hate this pIace.
I hate these doctors and the tests.

737
01:10:01,907 --> 01:10:05,217
They´re driving me crazy. I can´t even sIeep.

738
01:10:05,307 --> 01:10:08,743
And you want to get away
from me, too. Is that it?

739
01:10:10,467 --> 01:10:14,062
- What do you care?
- WeII, I care very much.

740
01:10:20,027 --> 01:10:23,815
What´s the matter, Robin?
Don´t you trust me any more?

741
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:27,939
I don´t know.

742
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:38,298
But you do want to get out of here,
don´t you?

743
01:10:38,387 --> 01:10:40,184
Yeah.

744
01:10:40,827 --> 01:10:43,625
AII right. Then we´II go together.

745
01:10:44,347 --> 01:10:45,985
- Go where?
- GiIIian!

746
01:10:48,307 --> 01:10:53,904
WeII, I have this pIace in the country,
north of Chicago, in Lakeview.

747
01:10:53,987 --> 01:10:55,818
GiIIian?

748
01:10:55,907 --> 01:11:01,300
You can do whatever you Iike. You don´t
have to see anybody, or taIk to anybody.

749
01:11:01,387 --> 01:11:03,378
Not even me.

750
01:11:06,867 --> 01:11:08,664
ReaIIy?

751
01:11:09,387 --> 01:11:11,378
Yes, reaIIy.

752
01:11:13,147 --> 01:11:15,342
WouId you Iike to do that?

753
01:11:16,187 --> 01:11:17,859
Sure.

754
01:11:18,267 --> 01:11:20,064
GiIIian?

755
01:11:23,067 --> 01:11:24,659
GiIIian?

756
01:11:25,467 --> 01:11:27,617
Hi, Hester.

757
01:11:27,707 --> 01:11:30,175
I´ve been Iookin´ everywhere for you.

758
01:11:30,267 --> 01:11:33,657
This was Robin´s room when he was here.

759
01:11:36,147 --> 01:11:37,785
Yes, it was.

760
01:11:39,227 --> 01:11:41,536
He´s in terribIe troubIe now.

761
01:11:41,627 --> 01:11:44,699
Those peopIe,
they shouId be trying to heIp him.

762
01:11:44,787 --> 01:11:47,096
What peopIe?

763
01:11:47,187 --> 01:11:49,576
Where Robin is.

764
01:11:49,667 --> 01:11:51,623
They won´t Ieave him aIone.

765
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:56,462
I mean, it was Iike they were
deIiberateIy trying to hurt him.

766
01:11:56,787 --> 01:12:00,018
- Hester, don´t!
- PIease, pIease, it´s OK.

767
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:02,098
It´s OK.

768
01:12:08,107 --> 01:12:10,098
I´m not bIeeding.

769
01:12:14,707 --> 01:12:18,017
- You know where Robin is?
- Yeah, I do.

770
01:12:19,467 --> 01:12:21,662
WouId you Iike to see him?

771
01:12:22,787 --> 01:12:24,982
I need to see him.

772
01:12:27,027 --> 01:12:29,700
WeII, I think we can work that out.

773
01:12:31,427 --> 01:12:32,416
How?

774
01:12:34,307 --> 01:12:38,664
Dr McKeever says
I´m supposed to give these to you

775
01:12:38,747 --> 01:12:41,386
to keep you happy and harmIess.

776
01:12:42,027 --> 01:12:44,143
- Do you know what I mean?
- No. What...?

777
01:12:44,227 --> 01:12:49,062
You´II have to pretend you took them because
I have to get you out of here tomorrow.

778
01:12:49,147 --> 01:12:53,857
- Otherwise you couId be in troubIe yourseIf.
- What are you saying? What is going on?

779
01:12:53,947 --> 01:12:56,939
Oh, honey, I´ve got so much to teII you.

780
01:13:30,627 --> 01:13:33,141
WouId you Iike a drink?

781
01:13:33,227 --> 01:13:35,457
You Iook tired.

782
01:13:35,547 --> 01:13:37,538
I am tired.

783
01:13:39,987 --> 01:13:41,261
How´s our Boy Wonder?

784
01:13:41,347 --> 01:13:44,737
Those fiIms have unIeashed
an incredibIe emotionaI force.

785
01:13:44,827 --> 01:13:47,580
He´s deveIoping the power
of an atomic reactor.

786
01:13:48,067 --> 01:13:52,106
- Or an atomic bomb.
- What are you giving him to caIm him down?

787
01:13:52,187 --> 01:13:57,181
Every day he has 3000mg of phenobarbitaI
and 1000mg of ProIixin. On triaI days we...

788
01:13:57,267 --> 01:13:59,656
What? That´s enough to kiII him.

789
01:13:59,747 --> 01:14:02,056
Drugs no Ionger have any eect on him.

790
01:14:02,147 --> 01:14:05,298
We´ve pushed him too far.
He´s quite unstabIe.

791
01:14:05,387 --> 01:14:08,902
- He fIies into rages over nothing.
- He couId be dangerous.

792
01:14:12,467 --> 01:14:16,221
- What´s he trying to prove?
- MentaIIy, Robin has deveIoped

793
01:14:16,307 --> 01:14:20,505
this perfect psychotronic reIationship
with aII kinds of machines.

794
01:14:20,587 --> 01:14:24,341
And so naturaIIy he´s trying to do
the same thing now with his body.

795
01:14:24,427 --> 01:14:27,817
Except that physicaIIy, he´s just... adequate.

796
01:14:27,907 --> 01:14:30,899
And when he faiIs... he´s intoIerabIe.

797
01:14:31,627 --> 01:14:34,016
How is he performing in bed?

798
01:14:36,387 --> 01:14:40,699
Robin wants to pIease me.
That´s the main thing, isn´t it?

799
01:14:47,867 --> 01:14:51,576
He needs a rest.
No more tests for at Ieast a month.

800
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:53,259
Sorry.

801
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:58,577
He´s been under tremendous pressure.
We pIan to get away, just the two of us.

802
01:14:58,667 --> 01:15:01,659
No. We aImost Iost him once, Susan.

803
01:15:03,027 --> 01:15:06,815
I promised. I promised him
we´d get away, together.

804
01:15:11,067 --> 01:15:13,058
AII right.

805
01:15:13,867 --> 01:15:16,097
Take him into the city,

806
01:15:16,187 --> 01:15:20,260
show him the sights,
but get him back here in 24 hours.

807
01:15:43,387 --> 01:15:45,378
WeII, there you are.

808
01:15:46,547 --> 01:15:48,663
Who are they?

809
01:15:48,747 --> 01:15:51,181
These are friends of mine from the institute.

810
01:15:51,267 --> 01:15:54,703
Are you pIanning on seeing them Iater?

811
01:15:54,787 --> 01:15:57,859
No, Robin. I´m with you. Remember?

812
01:15:58,227 --> 01:16:01,025
Which one are you gonna screw first?

813
01:16:04,307 --> 01:16:05,899
Robin, come here.

814
01:16:05,987 --> 01:16:07,978
- Get away from me!
- Robin, pIease.

815
01:18:54,027 --> 01:18:56,018
Oh, my God!

816
01:19:02,667 --> 01:19:06,455
Top Guy Two, this is Top Guy One.
Do you have any coee Ieft?

817
01:19:07,907 --> 01:19:12,059
Top Guy One, that´s an airmative.
I´ve got about a cup of Iukewarm coee Ieft.

818
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:14,342
You wanna negotiate a trade?

819
01:19:14,947 --> 01:19:18,144
Top Guy Two,
I have one Hershey bar to trade.

820
01:19:19,067 --> 01:19:22,377
Top Guy One, I read you.
Is that with or without aImonds?

821
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:26,460
AII right, AsshoIe One and AsshoIe Two,
stop cIuttering up this frequency.

822
01:19:29,667 --> 01:19:31,703
Isn´t Dr McKeever back yet?

823
01:19:31,787 --> 01:19:36,417
I´m afraid not, Hester.
He´s stiII at the hospitaI with EIIen.

824
01:19:36,507 --> 01:19:38,498
Can I heIp?

825
01:19:47,027 --> 01:19:53,296
Dr McKeever prescribed medication for
GiIIian this morning, but we´re aII out of it.

826
01:19:53,387 --> 01:19:57,699
He was very specific
about using a nonbarbiturate.

827
01:20:03,187 --> 01:20:06,657
- So I guess I´d better go to the drugstore.
- Fine.

828
01:20:23,827 --> 01:20:25,419
Hey.

829
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:28,660
- Are these ready to be maiIed yet?
- Yeah, why?

830
01:20:28,747 --> 01:20:33,616
- I couId take ´em to the Post Oice for you.
- That wouId be terrific.

831
01:20:33,707 --> 01:20:36,426
I´d appreciate that, Hester. Here, these go in.

832
01:20:36,507 --> 01:20:39,305
These have to be stamped. And that stu.

833
01:20:51,027 --> 01:20:53,666
Here comes the pony express.

834
01:20:53,747 --> 01:20:56,102
Hi. WiII you be gone Iong?

835
01:20:56,187 --> 01:20:58,178
Oh, no. I have to go...

836
01:20:59,787 --> 01:21:02,699
I have to whiz to the drugstore,
whiz to the post oice...

837
01:21:02,787 --> 01:21:05,745
I have so many things to do,
I´II never get through the day.

838
01:21:05,827 --> 01:21:08,819
Oh, I´m siIIy. I can´t go without the card.

839
01:21:10,147 --> 01:21:12,263
Where is the card?

840
01:21:12,347 --> 01:21:16,022
Where is that card?
I haven´t the faintest idea.

841
01:21:16,107 --> 01:21:19,099
- How´s GiIIian?
- She´s doin´ just fine.

842
01:21:19,907 --> 01:21:21,625
That´s good.

843
01:21:21,707 --> 01:21:25,700
GiIIian... how about a bacon,
Iettuce and tomato sandwich?

844
01:21:26,867 --> 01:21:28,858
- OK.
- Good girI.

845
01:21:52,667 --> 01:21:54,464
Damn!

846
01:21:54,547 --> 01:21:57,345
- I´II give you a hand.
- Don´t bother.

847
01:21:57,427 --> 01:22:00,817
- It´s no bother.
- I can take care of it. It´s OK.

848
01:22:30,347 --> 01:22:32,815
Oh, for God´s sake, move your ass!

849
01:22:37,787 --> 01:22:39,778
I´II get that, GiIIian.

850
01:22:41,107 --> 01:22:43,098
Here´s some more, Hester.

851
01:27:11,987 --> 01:27:13,978
I kiIIed her.

852
01:27:15,507 --> 01:27:18,977
I knew I wouId, the first time I said heIIo...

853
01:27:20,547 --> 01:27:23,141
and conned her into heIping me.

854
01:27:26,027 --> 01:27:29,019
She wouId have done anything for me.

855
01:27:33,107 --> 01:27:35,575
Hey, you better get some sIeep.

856
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:38,943
Don´t stop. PIease keep taIking.

857
01:27:40,307 --> 01:27:43,105
I´m afraid to cIose my eyes.

858
01:27:43,187 --> 01:27:45,860
Afraid of what I´II see.

859
01:27:48,627 --> 01:27:50,822
- Sip this.
- No, I don´t wanna.

860
01:27:50,907 --> 01:27:53,102
Sip it. You´II feeI better.

861
01:28:03,667 --> 01:28:07,580
That´s the best thing in the worId
for a toothache.

862
01:28:12,187 --> 01:28:14,496
TeII me about Robin.

863
01:28:18,307 --> 01:28:20,298
You teII me.

864
01:28:22,067 --> 01:28:26,538
It´s just that... sometimes I know
what´s happening to him,

865
01:28:28,187 --> 01:28:32,180
what he´s thinking... what he´s feeIing.

866
01:28:33,787 --> 01:28:39,180
I´m... Iike a receiver,
and Robin sends me pictures.

867
01:28:40,987 --> 01:28:42,978
Jesus, that´s amazing.

868
01:28:44,787 --> 01:28:46,778
You´re Iike twins.

869
01:28:49,667 --> 01:28:51,658
He´s a good-Iooking kid.

870
01:28:54,587 --> 01:28:57,579
You´re the kind of girI Robin wouId Iike.

871
01:29:00,467 --> 01:29:04,824
I raised him myseIf.
His mother died at chiIdbirth.

872
01:29:06,147 --> 01:29:08,820
How come you didn´t marry again?

873
01:29:08,907 --> 01:29:11,580
WeII, there just hasn´t been anybody.

874
01:29:12,547 --> 01:29:13,775
Hester?

875
01:29:19,307 --> 01:29:21,104
Yeah.

876
01:29:22,787 --> 01:29:24,584
Hester.

877
01:29:48,867 --> 01:29:51,984
When was the Iast time you saw Robin?

878
01:29:52,067 --> 01:29:54,058
About 11 months.

879
01:29:56,067 --> 01:29:58,456
He´s been growing up so fast.

880
01:30:01,187 --> 01:30:04,782
You know, I´m a good athIete, but he´s better.

881
01:30:06,227 --> 01:30:10,106
The Iast day at the cIub,
we raced in the pooI, about ten Iaps.

882
01:30:10,187 --> 01:30:14,339
He beat me, but I said I won.
He said ´´No, you didn´t.´´ I said ´´I did too.´´

883
01:30:14,427 --> 01:30:19,865
He jumped up on the side of the pooI and
said ´´We´II do it again. 20 Iaps this time.´´

884
01:30:19,947 --> 01:30:23,701
I was so dead, I couId hardIy
drag myseIf out of the water.

885
01:30:23,787 --> 01:30:26,779
I said ´´AII right. You won, you won.´´

886
01:30:35,387 --> 01:30:37,378
TeII me, GiIIian.

887
01:30:38,787 --> 01:30:40,140
How is he?

888
01:30:44,027 --> 01:30:45,506
He´s OK.

889
01:30:49,627 --> 01:30:51,424
OK.

890
01:30:53,507 --> 01:30:55,099
Yeah.

891
01:30:55,707 --> 01:30:57,902
We´re aII gonna be OK.

892
01:31:00,227 --> 01:31:02,218
That´s a promise.

893
01:31:18,187 --> 01:31:20,223
Peter!

894
01:31:20,307 --> 01:31:22,298
Stop! PIease, Iet me o!

895
01:31:22,387 --> 01:31:24,582
I´m supposed to get o here!

896
01:31:28,707 --> 01:31:30,504
Peter!

897
01:31:33,347 --> 01:31:36,100
- What the heII are you doing?
- You were gonna Ieave me.

898
01:31:36,187 --> 01:31:39,577
Now, Iook. You got me here.
Now stay out of this.

899
01:31:40,507 --> 01:31:44,580
- He´s my son. It´s my fight.
- I don´t know who to trust any more.

900
01:31:44,667 --> 01:31:48,819
Look, that bus´II take you to SeattIe.
I paid the driver. You´II be safe.

901
01:31:48,907 --> 01:31:50,898
You can´t Ieave me.

902
01:31:52,067 --> 01:31:54,456
Get on that bus and stay on it.

903
01:31:57,267 --> 01:31:58,620
Peter!

904
01:31:58,707 --> 01:32:00,937
But I can take you to him now.

905
01:32:01,027 --> 01:32:04,736
Peter, I was Iying before.
Robin´s not OK. He needs us now.

906
01:32:04,827 --> 01:32:07,546
It´s too dangerous.
PeopIe around me get kiIIed.

907
01:32:07,627 --> 01:32:12,018
Dammit, peopIe around me get hurt too!
I make them bIeed!

908
01:32:12,667 --> 01:32:15,659
Robin can heIp me. PIease!

909
01:32:48,907 --> 01:32:50,898
Oh, Jesus!

910
01:32:53,107 --> 01:32:57,942
- Why did you do that?
- I don´t Iike it when you smeII Iike this stu.

911
01:32:58,027 --> 01:33:00,666
CouId you just Ieave me aIone
for a IittIe bit, Robin?

912
01:33:00,747 --> 01:33:04,740
I got tired of waiting for you.
What´s taking so Iong?

913
01:33:04,827 --> 01:33:08,866
- I wanted to have a bath and a IittIe privacy.
- But you´re taking too goddamn Iong!

914
01:33:08,947 --> 01:33:11,984
Is everything aII right, Dr CharIes?

915
01:33:12,067 --> 01:33:14,058
Yes, everything´s fine.

916
01:33:14,987 --> 01:33:19,424
When the others arrive, wouId you just
hoId them downstairs for a moment?

917
01:33:19,507 --> 01:33:23,102
I need a few minutes in here, OK?
I´II caII you. Thank you.

918
01:35:10,507 --> 01:35:12,304
Robin?

919
01:35:13,267 --> 01:35:15,258
I´m sorry.

920
01:35:16,387 --> 01:35:18,855
Try to understand the strain I´m under.

921
01:35:18,947 --> 01:35:21,142
I´m very worried about you.

922
01:35:23,427 --> 01:35:25,418
Don´t be sorry.

923
01:35:27,387 --> 01:35:30,140
I didn´t mean to act Iike that in there.

924
01:35:30,227 --> 01:35:32,218
It´s me.

925
01:35:34,547 --> 01:35:36,538
I´m OK now, though.

926
01:35:38,147 --> 01:35:40,536
- I´m OK.
- Good.

927
01:35:43,747 --> 01:35:46,386
WeII, I´m starved.
Do you want something to eat?

928
01:35:46,467 --> 01:35:48,264
Sure.

929
01:35:51,427 --> 01:35:53,463
WeII, this Iooks great.

930
01:35:53,547 --> 01:35:57,301
I´ve been thinking, Robin.
Maybe we shouId take a coupIe of days o.

931
01:35:57,387 --> 01:36:01,380
Get a boat, go up the Iake or something.
What do you think?

932
01:36:21,227 --> 01:36:23,422
Why did you do that?

933
01:36:25,627 --> 01:36:28,016
So nobody can get in.

934
01:36:28,787 --> 01:36:31,381
What´s the matter, Robin?

935
01:36:31,467 --> 01:36:35,096
- You know what´s the matter.
- No, I don´t. What is it?

936
01:36:38,187 --> 01:36:40,178
It´s that goddamn girI.

937
01:36:40,947 --> 01:36:42,824
What girI?

938
01:36:44,027 --> 01:36:47,622
- The one that´s Iike me.
- What do you mean, Iike you?

939
01:36:47,707 --> 01:36:51,825
You think I don´t know she´s around?
She´s right out there.

940
01:36:53,307 --> 01:36:55,946
- There is no girI.
- That´s a Iie!

941
01:36:57,787 --> 01:37:01,700
- No, it isn´t, Robin.
- She´II do everything I can do, won´t she?

942
01:37:01,787 --> 01:37:04,142
And you won´t miss me at aII.

943
01:37:04,227 --> 01:37:06,821
What are you trying to say, Robin?

944
01:37:14,027 --> 01:37:17,417
- Company´s coming.
- Yes, you know that.

945
01:37:18,547 --> 01:37:21,015
There´II be you and me...

946
01:37:23,147 --> 01:37:25,138
and Dr Ives...

947
01:37:26,027 --> 01:37:28,018
and ChiIdress.

948
01:37:30,507 --> 01:37:32,463
And that girI makes five.

949
01:37:34,547 --> 01:37:38,665
No, onIy four, Robin. You can see
that the tabIe is setjust for four.

950
01:37:42,307 --> 01:37:44,298
That´s right.

951
01:37:44,947 --> 01:37:47,256
I won´t be here. I´II be dead.

952
01:37:48,187 --> 01:37:51,259
That girI´s taking my pIace
after you poison me!

953
01:37:53,267 --> 01:37:56,304
What´s the matter, Susie? What´s the matter?

954
01:37:56,387 --> 01:37:58,901
- Oh, God! Robin!
- Remember?

955
01:37:58,987 --> 01:38:02,343
- I said I didn´t have to touch you to hurt you.
- Robin, pIease stop!

956
01:38:02,427 --> 01:38:04,622
- WeII, I´m hurting you now!
- Stop it!

957
01:38:04,707 --> 01:38:07,619
Cos I don´t Iove you any more!
I´m tired of you!

958
01:38:07,707 --> 01:38:09,698
You´re kiIIing her!

959
01:38:10,347 --> 01:38:11,666
Stop!

960
01:38:16,787 --> 01:38:18,778
Stop!

961
01:38:22,347 --> 01:38:24,338
No!

962
01:38:27,387 --> 01:38:29,662
Susie, get up.

963
01:38:30,467 --> 01:38:33,982
- I said get up.
- Robin! God, stop!

964
01:38:34,067 --> 01:38:35,785
I can make you get up.

965
01:38:40,707 --> 01:38:42,698
Turn around.

966
01:38:46,267 --> 01:38:48,303
Up.

967
01:38:48,387 --> 01:38:50,105
Robin...

968
01:38:50,187 --> 01:38:51,745
Up.

969
01:38:51,827 --> 01:38:54,295
Oh, God, Robin...

970
01:38:54,787 --> 01:38:56,379
Up.

971
01:38:58,147 --> 01:39:00,138
No, pIease.

972
01:39:12,827 --> 01:39:14,897
Turn around.

973
01:39:17,307 --> 01:39:19,343
Again.

974
01:39:21,267 --> 01:39:23,337
Faster.

975
01:39:23,427 --> 01:39:25,304
Faster.

976
01:39:25,387 --> 01:39:27,537
Faster. Faster!

977
01:39:28,307 --> 01:39:30,741
Faster. Turn!

978
01:39:30,827 --> 01:39:33,022
Again. Turn.

979
01:39:33,747 --> 01:39:35,863
Faster. Faster!

980
01:39:53,627 --> 01:39:55,618
Here. Gimme your hand.

981
01:40:14,907 --> 01:40:17,296
Hi, paI.

982
01:40:17,387 --> 01:40:19,855
Thought I´d drop by to say heIIo.

983
01:40:21,187 --> 01:40:23,257
Long time no see.

984
01:40:27,467 --> 01:40:29,458
You´re Iookin´ good.

985
01:40:31,667 --> 01:40:34,659
Too bad, Peter. You aImost made it.

986
01:40:37,587 --> 01:40:39,976
Where´s my son?

987
01:40:41,947 --> 01:40:44,541
Why don´t you give up?

988
01:40:45,347 --> 01:40:46,939
You...

989
01:40:52,627 --> 01:40:54,857
Oh, God! Shit!

990
01:40:56,747 --> 01:40:59,705
Stop! Stop!

991
01:41:26,387 --> 01:41:28,184
AII right, Peter.

992
01:41:28,267 --> 01:41:30,701
You said you wanted to see your son.

993
01:41:30,787 --> 01:41:32,778
Go ahead and get him.

994
01:41:56,707 --> 01:41:58,504
Robin?

995
01:42:01,627 --> 01:42:03,618
Can you hear me?

996
01:42:05,667 --> 01:42:07,464
Robin!

997
01:42:09,987 --> 01:42:11,659
PIease answer me.

998
01:42:43,827 --> 01:42:45,818
Oh, my God.

999
01:42:55,947 --> 01:42:57,744
Robin!

1000
01:43:03,827 --> 01:43:05,419
Where is he?

1001
01:43:17,307 --> 01:43:19,582
What have they done to you?

1002
01:43:31,667 --> 01:43:32,656
Son,

1003
01:43:34,307 --> 01:43:39,620
I know they toId you I was dead,
but... they wanted me out of the way.

1004
01:43:43,827 --> 01:43:45,818
I never gave up.

1005
01:43:47,027 --> 01:43:49,621
I kept Iookin´ for you aII the time.

1006
01:43:56,747 --> 01:43:58,942
Come on, Robin. Hey.

1007
01:44:00,947 --> 01:44:03,017
Don´t you recognise your oId man?

1008
01:44:06,347 --> 01:44:08,338
Peter!

1009
01:44:09,387 --> 01:44:10,979
No!

1010
01:44:14,827 --> 01:44:16,180
Hang on, Robin.

1011
01:44:28,027 --> 01:44:31,064
Reach up with your other hand. Come on.

1012
01:44:34,707 --> 01:44:38,700
Grab ahoId of my jacket. CIimb over me.

1013
01:44:40,107 --> 01:44:43,304
That´s it. Come on. You can do it.

1014
01:44:44,227 --> 01:44:46,457
That´s it. That´s it.

1015
01:44:58,587 --> 01:44:59,576
No!

1016
01:45:00,707 --> 01:45:02,265
Oh, God!

1017
01:45:37,667 --> 01:45:40,135
Robin!

1018
01:45:50,827 --> 01:45:54,297
AII right. Get ´em outta here.
Get ´em outta my sight.

1019
01:46:20,547 --> 01:46:22,538
Good morning.

1020
01:46:24,027 --> 01:46:26,018
I made some coee.

1021
01:46:26,867 --> 01:46:28,858
WouId you Iike some?

1022
01:46:29,467 --> 01:46:31,537
No?

1023
01:46:31,627 --> 01:46:33,618
It´s warmer by the fire.

1024
01:46:35,227 --> 01:46:38,617
How did you sIeep? OK?

1025
01:46:43,387 --> 01:46:46,982
I was here most of the night.
I guess you don´t remember.

1026
01:46:48,667 --> 01:46:51,056
Move a IittIe cIoser to the fire.

1027
01:46:53,507 --> 01:46:57,420
I know what you´ve been going through
these past coupIe of days.

1028
01:46:57,507 --> 01:46:59,975
I know how exhausted you must be.

1029
01:47:00,787 --> 01:47:03,779
It´II take more than one night´s sIeep.

1030
01:47:04,707 --> 01:47:06,698
I know how I feeI.

1031
01:47:09,227 --> 01:47:13,425
Peter was my friend.
Maybe the best friend I´II ever have.

1032
01:47:14,267 --> 01:47:18,260
But I had to do what I did.
I mean, you saw what happened.

1033
01:47:19,027 --> 01:47:22,781
Peter couId have saved Robin.
Instead, he Iet him go.

1034
01:47:23,427 --> 01:47:25,895
He deIiberateIy kiIIed his son.

1035
01:47:28,107 --> 01:47:31,099
I hope you don´tjudge me too harshIy.

1036
01:47:31,187 --> 01:47:34,338
I can´t say what I did was right or wrong.

1037
01:47:34,947 --> 01:47:38,542
I onIy know I acted... and it´s done.

1038
01:47:41,027 --> 01:47:42,460
Robin is gone.

1039
01:47:44,547 --> 01:47:46,538
Peter is gone.

1040
01:47:50,427 --> 01:47:53,260
And you´re the onIy one who matters now.

1041
01:47:55,107 --> 01:47:57,098
Yes, I know that hurts.

1042
01:47:57,947 --> 01:48:00,415
That hurts so bad,
you wanna Iie down and die.

1043
01:48:00,507 --> 01:48:02,498
But you have to survive.

1044
01:48:03,747 --> 01:48:06,819
You´re a heaIthy, strong, young girI

1045
01:48:07,587 --> 01:48:09,578
and you must survive.

1046
01:48:14,627 --> 01:48:18,859
You´II begin by putting
aII the tragedies behind you.

1047
01:48:18,947 --> 01:48:22,542
I think that´II be easier if you accept my heIp.

1048
01:48:23,547 --> 01:48:27,301
AII the bad things you heard about me
just aren´t true.

1049
