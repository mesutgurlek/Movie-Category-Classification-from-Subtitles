<i>...the reports from Barcelona are still vague.</i>

1
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:16,385
<i>Apparently, a building was quarantined</i>

2
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,424
<i>because of an infectious disease...</i>

3
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:22,562
<i>Among those who are trapped inside the building</i>

4
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:26,099
<i>are residents, police officers, fire fighters,</i>

5
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,565
<i>as well as two TV station employees ...</i>

6
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,315
<i>...concrete informations about the pathogen.</i>

7
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:37,486
<i>Neither administration officials nor experts 
were ready to comment...</i>

8
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,906
<i>... a female news reporter</i>

9
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:45,043
<i>is believed to be the sole survivor...</i>

10
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:49,172
<i>...roadblocks in a wide area around the building.</i>

11
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:55,338
<i>It was just confirmed that the military
has brought the situation under control.</i>

12
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,005
All clear.

13
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,765
<i>Copy that. Move in.</i>

14
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,847
This way.

15
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,285
Guzm√°n, Lucas. The third floor.

16
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,495
Cover me.

17
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:26,751
In here.

18
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,379
All clear.

19
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,796
Second floor, charge is ready.

20
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,168
Let's go up.

21
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,184
Lucas.

22
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,102
Lucas! Shit!

23
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,155
Lucas, where the hell have you been?

24
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,194
- All done.
- All charges are in place.

25
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,161
<i>- Copy that.</i>
- Let's get out of here.

26
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,994
- What was that?
- Shit, shit shit!

27
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:09,332
<i>The charges will detonate in four minutes.</i>

28
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,961
Let's get out.

29
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,048
Get out of here, folks. 
Everybody out!

30
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,679
What's going on?

31
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,185
Are you ok? Can you breathe?

32
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,104
Get out of here, now!

33
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,858
Shit!

34
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,534
I'm out of ammo!

35
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,168
- Fire! Shoot him!
- Get away from him!

36
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,175
Fuck!

37
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,687
You're a doctor, aren't you?

38
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,145
You can help me.

39
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,319
<i>Detonation in three minutes.</i>

40
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,826
These are the rules.

41
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,215
Come on. Come on. Do it!

42
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,094
We need to get out of here.

43
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,263
Help! I'm up here!

44
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,391
- We have to get her out. 
- No way!

45
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,643
We're out of time.

46
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,528
- You go ahead, I'll deal with this.
- You're crazy.

47
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,691
Get me out of here, please.

48
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,200
Shit.

49
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,640
Everything's ok. Don't panic.

50
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,059
I'm not going to harm you.

51
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,316
<i>Detonation in one minute.</i>

52
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,358
Look at me. I'll get you out of here.

53
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,402
Hello, Angela.

54
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,655
Don't get upset.

55
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,325
These are to keep you from hurting yourself.

56
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,414
That's better.

57
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,547
Do you remember anything?

58
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,466
No.

59
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,970
Please hold still.

60
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,559
No.

61
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:54,848
Don't.

62
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,607
You're almost done.

63
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,279
Where am I?

64
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,866
We need to make sure that you aren't sick.

65
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,915
Good night.

66
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,534
Sorry.

67
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,370
Do you happen to know where the wedding is?

68
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,158
I suppose I had one drink too much.

69
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:44,750
My daughter-in-law must have taken me to a room.

70
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,836
I must have fallen asleep there.

71
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,001
I have no idea what you're talking about.

72
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,845
I don't know where I am.

73
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,090
My mind must be playing tricks on me.

74
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,181
Well, I don't know where we are either.

75
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:05,309
- Gee, this is going to be fun. 
- Have you seen anyone else?

76
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,483
Ok, this is what we'll do.

77
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:14,401
I'm going find out where we are. You wait here.

78
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,694
- Someone will come and pick you up soon. 
- Good.

79
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:20,744
If you happen to run into my daughter-in-law,

80
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,328
tell her that I'm here.

81
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,084
Yes, I'll tell her.

82
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,937
How is she?

83
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,274
She is awake and quite calm and composed.

84
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:56,276
We're only wasting time. She is healthy.
There is no reason to be this cautious.

85
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,698
She was in there for more than six hours.

86
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,202
We need to be absolutely sure.

87
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,428
These are hurting me.

88
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:26,021
No problem, I'll loosen it a little.

89
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,451
Stop!

90
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,171
Fuck.
Attention!

91
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,215
<i>Our patient is on the run.</i>

92
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,677
Seize her, by force if need be.

93
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,016
- How much longer?
- Two minutes.

94
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,776
- She's going up. 
- Stop!

95
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,664
Come on!

96
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,706
She's running to the dining room.

97
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,713
Stop right there!

98
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,433
Go! Go! Come on, run!

99
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,348
Run! Go!

100
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,520
Hold it.

101
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,026
- You?
- Step away.

102
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,775
- We got her.
- Didn't you hear me?

103
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,652
- Help me. 
- I said, "step away."

104
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,578
- Come!
- Don't move!

105
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,996
Fuck!

106
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,289
Come, quickly.

107
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,004
Come on, quick.

108
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,344
Freeze! Hands in the air, don't move!

109
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,972
Freeze. Don't move!

110
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,770
- We have them and are waiting for orders.
- Where are we here?

111
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,478
Lower your weapons. The test says they're clean.

112
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,314
- Who are you?
- Take her to her cabin.

113
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,777
- You should rest.
- No.

114
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,864
Don't worry, we won't restrain you anymore.
I give you my word.

115
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,333
I demand to know who you are.

116
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,214
I really regret this incident.

117
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,378
- I'm Dr. Ricarte.
- I want to speak my superiors.

118
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,720
They sent you here.

119
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,683
And my partner?

120
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,478
I assume you're talking about Private Lucas.

121
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:20,321
We had to examine him. Just a routine procedure. 
He'll be with you soon.

122
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,657
Why are we here?
This wasn't part of the operation.

123
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,778
We can ensure complete isolation here.

124
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,373
What for? We're fine. You've examined me.

125
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,204
The situation is a little more complicated than that.

126
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,748
There was another case in Barcelona.

127
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:43,924
We were able to get it under control, 
but another mistake would be disastrous.

128
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,298
Let me guess: a wedding.

129
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:51,515
There was only a single survivor. 
I see you've already met her.

130
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,476
Hey, new passengers?

131
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,227
That's just great.

132
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,851
Please excuse me.

133
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:03,113
I'm sure our Captain Ortega will be happy
to show you his ship.

134
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,653
Captain.

135
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:10,037
You must have come on board with the last group.

136
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,198
I guess so. I'm Guzm√°n.

137
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,915
I'll show you around.

138
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:37,390
- So, you're in charge here?
- The people who pay me are in charge.

139
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,610
And these doctors have paid me enough I can retire.

140
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,396
40 years travelling the ocean are enough for me.

141
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:48,659
After this I'll return home. It's about time to retire.

142
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,490
So, the doctors call the shots?

143
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,748
Yes, and they've brought their own army along for the ride.

144
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,000
I think you've already made their acquaintance.

145
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,717
What's the status?

146
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:13,134
28 knots. Northeast wind has sprung up.

147
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:16,145
We'll soon head into a low pressure system.

148
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:20,354
Alright. Minimum speed ahead. With luck, it'll pass by us.

149
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,859
Of course. It’s not like we’re in a hurry or anything.

150
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:27,114
Gorostiaga is the ship's officer. From Bilbao. Great guy.

151
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,071
Pilot, that's shorter. Call me Goro.

152
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,156
That graze doesn't look good.

153
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:36,248
This? Tell it to those brave soldiers.
It's their handiwork.

154
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,828
Have you dressed it with something?

155
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,169
You should disinfect it.

156
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:45,083
Listen to him, he's a doctor.
An expert for infections and such.

157
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,379
Not again.

158
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,301
This tub is too old for jaunts like this.

159
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,262
Nah, she's not too old.

160
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:58,805
The generator is overloading 
because of all the medical equipment.

161
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,351
What do you mean?

162
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:04,269
We've been having brownouts ever since we left port.

163
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,778
At night, we even get complete blackouts.

164
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:10,066
They're building some kind of laboratory down there.

165
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:14,613
- What medical equipment? 
- It's really none of our business.

166
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,217
Sorry.

167
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,588
I didn't mean to disturb you, but...

168
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,140
Do I know you?

169
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:40,221
I get really confused with so many people here.

170
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:46,356
Are you related to my grandson or to the bride?

171
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,152
You probably had too much to drink?

172
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,121
Don't worry, dear, me too.

173
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,857
Nick. Nick!

174
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,311
What are you doing there?

175
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,688
Nothing.

176
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,651
It may not seem that way, but Nick is our radio operator.

177
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,615
Well, it's not like there's a whole lot for me to do.

178
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:42,328
They've encrypted the frequencies,
and they're the only ones who have the codes.

179
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:48,293
- We have no contact with the outside?
- They won't even allow us lifeboats.

180
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,125
I suppose nobody told you that.

181
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,549
Even the drainage system has been closed off.

182
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,296
They insisted on that.

183
00:16:56,474 --> 00:17:00,559
What did they call it again? “Security Protocols”.

184
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,937
- Can you believe it?
- How are you coming along with the camera?

185
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,391
I'm working on it, but it takes time.

186
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:11,903
The camera still works,
but the hard drive is on the fritz.

187
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,615
I have to recover each sector individually.
It's a tedious process.

188
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:19,574
Nick doubles as our IT technician or whatever you call it.

189
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,206
The doctors want him to restore the video files.

190
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,083
They're very keen on watching it.

191
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,746
It was me who found the camera, next to the reporter.

192
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:32,750
Get out! You're the one who saved √Ångela Vidal?

193
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,010
Something like that.

194
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,719
- You can't imagine how happy this makes him. 
- I'm a huge fan of her!

195
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,179
I never miss any of her reportages.

196
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,723
And now she's visiting you in person.

197
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,309
So it would seem.

198
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:53,191
Seeing that you rescued her, you probably know her well.

199
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:58,200
Well, at least a little. Enough to introduce me to her.

200
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,198
Of course.

201
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,075
Great!

202
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,708
What do you think of our Filipino DJ?

203
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,827
I guess he had no better tune.

204
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,669
That's the dinner bell.
You get used to it eventually.

205
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,392
Hello, the deep sea speaking. What's up?

206
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,102
<i>Everything okay down there?</i>

207
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,314
- It's worse than I thought.
<i>- Crap.</i>

208
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,900
You need to have a little patience up there.

209
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,406
<i>Well, time is one thing we have plenty of.</i>

210
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,319
<i>Have some dinner before you tinker on with it.</i>

211
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,657
<i>Yeah, that's probably a good idea.</i>

212
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,378
Here you go.

213
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,124
There's nothing else on the menu.

214
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,921
You know...

215
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,634
I don't eat much in the evening.

216
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,471
A glass of warm milk is all I need.

217
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,686
I see.

218
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:12,023
Could I maybe get a glass of milk for the Lady?

219
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,520
- Milk? 
- And a few cookies, if it's not too much to ask.

220
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:20,900
And maybe you've got a little meat, or at least gravy.

221
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:27,202
Hey. That bracelet doesn't mean
that you're on a cruise ship.

222
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,536
Take it easy.

223
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,000
Where have you been?

224
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,000
- I could ask you the same.
- True.

225
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,838
- Have you heard anything from my family?
- No.

226
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,973
I understand that the wedding has to be modern,

227
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,563
but this here is too much of a good thing.

228
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,145
- Milk and cookies.
- Great.

229
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,984
Thanks, that's very sweet.

230
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,192
They have sugar over there.

231
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,159
Oh? Well, a little bit won't hurt me.

232
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:14,962
She is very confused and has no idea where she is.

233
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,169
- Someone should talk to her.
- Really?

234
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,260
What should we tell her? That her family is dead?

235
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,933
I just met with the captain.

236
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:33,271
They had to cut the lifeboats,
and all radio traffic is stopped.

237
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,057
- What?
- That's right.

238
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,604
They've set up a laboratory.

239
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:41,237
Wasn't there a mention of preventive quarantine?

240
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,443
But a laboratory?

241
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:47,319
They're keeping something from us. 
Why are all these soldiers here?

242
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,080
Have you seen all the cameras?

243
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:56,291
They're everywhere.
You can't even take a leak without being filmed.

244
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,790
It drives me crazy.

245
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,628
Well, maybe we're over-reacting.

246
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,897
Looks like you've done it. Good job.

247
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:24,273
You know, you could work for Naval Intelligence. I...

248
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,783
- Seriously?
- Well, you never know.

249
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,035
Naval Intelligence. Wow.

250
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:35,250
Say, do you know a way to access their
surveillance cameras from here?

251
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:40,171
- Who do you think I am?
- I've seen you watch a feed earlier.

252
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:43,880
That was the first thing I did.
I was just trying to pass the time.

253
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,840
How do you think I found out about her?

254
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,096
It's crazy.

255
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,633
- You're still going to introduce me to her, right? 
- Of course.

256
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,223
And the lab?

257
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:03,312
The door opens with a numerical code.
They don't want any visitors.

258
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:07,111
They think themselves safe,
but they haven’t faced me yet.

259
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,861
There it is.

260
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:17,000
- What are they up to in there?
- Nothing good, I suppose.

261
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,537
I've seen them bringing cages aboard.

262
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,546
What use would they possibly be?

263
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,420
Freaking cages.

264
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,263
And what's behind that door?

265
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,220
No idea. There are no cameras.

266
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,471
I can't get any closer than this.

267
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,105
200% zoom. Not bad, eh?

268
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,403
No, not bad at all.

269
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,900
Does this work with all cameras?

270
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,785
Which one would you like to see?

271
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,651
Please, not now.

272
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,646
It's happening again.

273
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,619
Come on.

274
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,628
Hey!

275
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,463
What is it?

276
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:22,102
I have no idea what you're doing down here.

277
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,601
This should have been fixed long ago.

278
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,646
Oh really? Well, if you say so.

279
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,985
He's fucking with us.

280
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:36,275
I guess where you come from,
you negros like to take things slow.

281
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:37,909
But things work a little different around here.

282
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,905
Now get the fuck to work already!

283
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,164
I come from M√≥stoles [a part of Madrid].

284
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,375
And on this ship, things work the way I say they work.

285
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,175
You heard me. Hurry up.

286
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,768
Do not worry, it's me.

287
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,359
What are you doing here?

288
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,361
I was scared.

289
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,613
It's ok. I'm with you now, ok?

290
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,074
- Let's go to our cabins. 
- Wait.

291
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,919
Please don't tell them about this.

292
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,129
Look, nobody here wants to harm you. Nobody.

293
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,797
Come on.

294
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,767
This looks like wind force eight [44 mph]. Wanna bet?

295
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,728
It's coming right at us.

296
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,688
- Looks that way.
- Shit.

297
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,445
It's dropping sooner than we thought.

298
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,565
What did you think?

299
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:45,077
This is my last trip.
I don't mind if it gets a little rough one last time.

300
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,738
I have a bad feeling about this.

301
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,494
Sorry to interrupt. Good Morning.

302
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,451
Good Morning.

303
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,203
This is √Ångela.

304
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,042
- Hello. 
- Hello.

305
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,127
I've heard a lot about you.

306
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,384
- That over there is...
- Goro.

307
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:04,131
- And over here is your number one fan.
- You can say that again.

308
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,223
Well, I sometimes watch your reportages.

309
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,729
- I'm Nick. Hello. 
- Hello.

310
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:16,317
- He is recovering the video from your camera.
- Well, I’m doing my best.

311
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,986
My camera?

312
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,359
It's here?

313
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:32,788
Say, do you ever watch your own broadcasts on TV?

314
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,248
Of course not, silly question.

315
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,048
I remember the reportage with the garbage men.

316
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,505
You jumped into the container,

317
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:44,470
and the guy looked like he didn't believe his eyes.

318
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,259
That was great.

319
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,638
- You want one?
- No.

320
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,449
- Excuse me, would you perhaps...
- What?

321
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:13,455
Record something for my voicemail, something 
like "Hi, I'm √Ångela Vidal..."?

322
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,086
That would really be great.

323
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,168
It doesn't have to be right now of course.

324
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,336
I guess people pester you with such requests
all the time.

325
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,178
Oh crap.

326
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,636
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, that was my fault.

327
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:35,104
It's waterproof.
At least that's how they sold it to me.

328
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,557
In case that we sink.

329
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:48,114
- Have you already watched it?
- A few parts.

330
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:53,911
I can't imagine what was going on there,
but I'm glad that I wasn't there.

331
00:29:58,422 --> 00:29:59,879
OPERATION COMPLETE

332
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,839
There it is now. Very good.

333
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:07,929
This part is done.
Now I just need to sort through it.

334
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,966
25 frames per second.
That'll take a while.

335
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:17,397
- How long do you think?
- About an hour.

336
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,932
Maybe less.

337
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,151
Are you sure you don't want one?
They're delicious.

338
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,866
Let's go.

339
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,132
He's gone. The host is gone.

340
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,218
What the hell are you saying?

341
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,136
- Sound the alarm!
- No!

342
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:54,179
We need to maintain control.
Lock it down.

343
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,252
The straps are intact.

344
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,634
- Someone has set him free.
- Impossible.

345
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,300
A security guard would have noticed something.

346
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,100
- It was during the power outage.
- And what about the door code?

347
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,892
- How many people know it?
- Very few.

348
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:47,813
- Nobody would do something so senseless.
- Everyone, come with me.

349
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,315
Bring the tazer and the serum.

350
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,735
- What is your plan? 
- Find him before he attacks somebody.

351
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,704
Let's hope this works.

352
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,393
Fuck.

353
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,598
- What's up with the food?
- What do you mean?

354
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:46,560
The Filipino's asleep.
We've been waiting for ten minutes.

355
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,225
This useless idiot.

356
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,815
Edwin?

357
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:59,410
Holy shit, what happened here?

358
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,371
Well, hello there.

359
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:08,453
At least you've put in some effort today.

360
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,127
Hello? Are you daydreaming over there?

361
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,805
The men are hungry.
Their tempers are getting worse by the minute.

362
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,842
Get cracking, do you hear me?

363
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:25,932
I'll take that with me. 
Hurry up now, or else there'll be trouble.

364
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,655
OPERATION COMPLETE

365
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,993
Yes. Wonderful.

366
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,409
All done.

367
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,502
SEND FILE

368
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,754
It's lamb today. What a great surprise.

369
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,218
- I hope there's still something left.
- Of course.

370
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:06,352
The second shift begins in 20 minutes.
Hurry up.

371
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,847
And how are you today?

372
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,353
They probably think I wouldn't notice

373
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,274
that they've put me in a nursing home,

374
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,160
without even telling me.

375
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,163
Do you have a little appetite today?

376
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,288
No, it's not my appetite that's amiss.

377
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:38,798
My stomach is acting up.
Could you perhaps talk to the steward?

378
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:44,557
Maybe he can make me some noodles or croquettes.

379
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:47,764
I can go ask him. But I can't promise anything.

380
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,852
Hello?

381
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:55,435
Hello?

382
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,832
Sorry.

383
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,084
Do you maybe have something else?

384
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:24,722
The old lady has a sensitive stomach
and would like some pasta or...

385
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,528
Fuck.

386
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,995
Here, just try a little bit.

387
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:59,253
It smells good enough.
I guess I'll have a little taste.

388
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:02,419
No! Stop! Don't eat that!

389
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:06,172
- What's going on?
- The chef tried to bite me.

390
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,095
- What? 
- And, did he?

391
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:10,972
No. No.

392
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,894
- Has anyone eaten anything?
- No.

393
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,647
Ok, you stay here.

394
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,228
- Wait.
- Stay here.

395
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,649
Hold it.

396
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:26,442
- What happened?
- I thought it was just about the quarantine.

397
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,569
Tell me what happened.

398
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,915
- The chef tried to bite me.
- Do you know what that means?

399
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,161
- Where is he?
- In the kitchen.

400
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,206
I've locked him into the cold storage room.

401
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:45,136
Alright. Come with me.

402
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,674
Only you.

403
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,976
It won't be long now.

404
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,772
This will be the zenith of my career.

405
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,810
Is everything ok with you?

406
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,104
I'm not feeling so great.

407
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,532
Something must have upset my stomach.

408
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,445
That doesn't surprise me.
It's this worm in raw fish.

409
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,113
- Anisakis? 
- What?

410
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:16,708
- The worm is called Anisakis.
- Whatever.

411
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,249
But there was no fish for dinner.

412
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,791
You best go and lie down a bit.

413
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,675
I'll hold the fort.

414
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,977
A serum. That's what we've been working on.

415
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,983
We were able to stop two outbreaks,

416
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:45,192
but the next time we might be less fortunate.

417
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:48,156
I thought nothing was known about the virus.

418
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,488
We know more than you think.

419
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,158
We got a sample.

420
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:57,746
We used it to inject a host. 
We were waiting for the symptoms to manifest and...

421
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,336
- Wait a minute. Where did you get the sample?
- That doesn't matter.

422
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:06,050
Someone has released the host,
and this presents us with a problem.

423
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,552
- How fucking wonderful.
- Give him the Tazer.

424
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,879
We don't have much time.

425
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,391
- What are you trying to do?
- We need to test the serum.

426
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,185
As soon as the door opens, pull the trigger.
The electric shock will paralyse him.

427
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,441
- You have to act fast. 
- Ok.

428
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,397
Ready?

429
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,111
- Go.
- Now!

430
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,536
Out of the way!

431
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,637
Get out of here!

432
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,429
Damn.

433
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,772
What the hell happened?

434
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,241
There was a feedback mechanism.

435
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,367
Damn, that can't be.

436
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,324
It obviously can.

437
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,116
It should have worked.

438
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:26,005
You've lost control. 
Now, will you kindly call in for help?

439
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:30,669
- He's right. They need to get us out.
- You know the rules.

440
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,595
Nobody is going to get us out of here.

441
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,806
Not anymore.

442
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:09,298
We need to go to the lab and continue our work.

443
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,550
Wait a minute, what about us?

444
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,421
We do not know whether the food is infected.

445
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:19,471
- None of us has eaten anything.
- Yes, I warned them just in time.

446
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:24,518
- Then there is no need to worry.
- I beg your pardon? We were the second group.

447
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:29,314
- You can't just leave us here.
- We cannot take any chances.

448
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,937
- Well then.
- Now wait a moment.

449
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:38,369
I've given you what you wanted.
Don't do this to us.

450
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:39,907
What is he talking about?

451
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,413
I'm sorry.

452
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,245
Come on, we don't have time for this.

453
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:45,705
Lucas?

454
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,123
What did you do?

455
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:53,251
They wanted me to bring a blood sample from the building.

456
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:55,090
Infected blood?

457
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:58,756
- It was only a little. They thought... 
- For whom?

458
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,975
It's not just a virus.

459
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:05,934
Some priests have shown me horrible photos.

460
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,599
- You have no idea.
- What else?

461
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,689
I was told they'd finance everything.

462
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,981
You motherfucker! Bastard! 
And now what?

463
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:16,774
Now, now...

464
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,701
This is no way to treat one another.

465
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,204
You have no idea what's going on here.

466
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:26,125
Maybe somebody should tell you

467
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,165
that your entire fucking family is dead!

468
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,874
- Dead! 
- Leave her alone!

469
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,415
Enough!

470
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,676
Whatever this is,

471
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:41,390
if the food was infected,
we need to prepare ourselves for the worst.

472
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:46,812
Let's go to the bridge.
Ortega can help us.

473
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,850
And how do we do that?
We don't even have any weapons.

474
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,321
Take anything that could be useful.
And hurry up.

475
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:33,476
- Here. 
- This is useless.

476
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,440
It's all we have. Let's go.

477
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,024
Come on.

478
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,356
Hurry up already!

479
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,214
Please don't take this as an insult,

480
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:03,256
but I'd really like to lie down for a while now.

481
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,679
Back, back.

482
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,272
Back...

483
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,270
Back, back, back. Back!

484
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:25,486
Fuck!

485
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:30,578
Get away from it!

486
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,663
We have to get out of here!

487
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,771
Come on, we need to make it to the bridge.

488
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,564
Come on, let's go.

489
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:02,030
They're all over the ship. Where is Goro?

490
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,113
He didn't feel well. He went to lie down.

491
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,322
Shit.

492
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:09,158
<i>- Deep sea speaking. What's up?</i> 
- Everything quiet down there?

493
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:11,619
<i>I didn't even get to eat dinner.</i>

494
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,660
Then keep it up until you hear from me again.

495
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,329
<i>- What's going on?</i>
- Just do what I tell you.

496
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,050
Lock the door.

497
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,529
This way. Come.

498
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,911
- Are you sure? 
- Yes, let's go.

499
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:53,370
Please call my children to come and pick me up.

500
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,996
We're almost there.

501
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:59,747
- I promise, I won't be a bother to them.
- Come on.

502
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:21,477
What is it now?
Don't you have anything better to do?

503
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:24,900
What is this?

504
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:55,769
Get out of here!

505
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,056
Help me!

506
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,355
- I can't.
- Shoot already!

507
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,478
- I can't!
- Help me!

508
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,816
What the hell is that?

509
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:12,778
Let go of him!

510
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:19,668
What is this?

511
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:24,665
The oil pressure is dropping.
Just what we fucking needed.

512
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,030
Get away from there!

513
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:03,079
Fuck! What was that?

514
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,881
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

515
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,798
Where is she?

516
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,008
- She's run off.
- I'm about to go nuts!

517
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:20,225
- What do we do now? 
- You go to the bridge. I'll go look for her.

518
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,222
Hey, where are you going?

519
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:25,942
You don't have a weapon. That's suicide.

520
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:28,570
We can't just let her down.

521
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,574
I've messed up.

522
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,946
And I need to make up for that.

523
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:46,959
Let's go.

524
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,561
It's us. Open up!

525
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,529
- Don't.
- But it’s...

526
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,032
- Open the door!
- They might be infected.

527
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,533
- Nick!
- Goro! Goro!

528
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,157
Quick, get in here.

529
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:23,954
Close the door!

530
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:28,664
What's going on out there?
Are the doctors after you?

531
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:32,838
You're in charge as of now.
We're going home.

532
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:35,755
I'd love to, but the engine is losing oil.

533
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,637
It could catch fire. I need to turn it off.

534
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:42,978
- No! No!
- Keep it together, man! Calm down!

535
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:47,315
Wait. We could turn on the auxiliary motor.

536
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:51,320
- Then do it.
- This is only possible from the engine room.

537
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:55,111
Fucking shit!
What is really going on here?

538
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,113
Weren't you in that building?

539
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:00,828
I have no idea.
But these doctors know something.

540
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,866
And we need to find out what it is.

541
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:08,291
Sure. And how do we do that?
Are you simply going to ask them?

542
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:15,382
Can't you hack into their computers?

543
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:26,764
They've given me network access so I can send them the video.

544
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:31,317
Shit, they've got an internal encryption.

545
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,232
- What is that?
- Nothing major.

546
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:38,446
- I'm at a loss. 
- It's all right.

547
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,576
This should have worked.

548
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:44,660
Maybe the virus has mutated with the DNA of the host.

549
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,457
- If that were the case, every sample would be different.
- Damn it.

550
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:54,216
We need the original strain that hasn't mutated.

551
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:56,627
The girl.

552
00:50:58,097 --> 00:50:59,884
But we don't have her.

553
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:03,220
Gentlemen,

554
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,102
it's over.

555
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,554
No, wait.

556
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:12,317
- There must be a way.
- I'm sorry.

557
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,352
You know the protocol.

558
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:24,617
- No.
- 20 minutes. Enjoy them.

559
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:28,207
Wait. We could try an enzyme inhibitor.

560
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:32,041
Maybe we can achieve a higher strength of the membrane.

561
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:35,882
This would only delay the process.
It won't do us any good.

562
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,465
Not without the original strain.
I'm sorry.

563
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,472
I'm begging you.
You can't do that.

564
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:44,887
We were not allowed to fail.

565
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,302
- You know the rules.
- No.

566
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:49,805
Wait. He's done it.

567
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:52,766
We have the video.

568
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,896
Here, see for yourself.

569
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,862
- Which are the oldest folders?
- One moment.

570
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,164
Here.

571
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,371
What this supposed to be?

572
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,706
- My goodness.
- Wait, wait.

573
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,800
I know this name.

574
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:25,553
From the building.
I saw it on some newspaper clippings.

575
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:33,849
This is the same girl.
There were photos of her all over the walls.

576
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:37,523
These are medical treatment records.

577
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,776
The Diocese of Naples had her admitted.

578
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,071
- The Church? 
- "Diagnostic test results." What's this?

579
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,743
Wait a minute.

580
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,247
The newspaper said that she was possessed.

581
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:55,083
There was something about the Church, and a demon.

582
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,750
Cut the bullshit.

583
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:01,297
It all makes sense.
They wanted a medical diagnosis.

584
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,721
And who admitted her?

585
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,432
Well, will you look at this.

586
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:21,775
What's that?

587
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:26,652
- Impossible. 
- It is the girl.

588
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:33,200
- What was she doing there?
- Rewind it.

589
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,255
What is happening there?

590
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:45,924
Oh god.

591
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,635
It's a parasite.

592
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:57,566
The source of the virus.
It was right under our noses.

593
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:01,354
So this is the demon. A parasite.

594
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:05,527
This thing has used the girl as a host.

595
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:09,657
But in order to protect itself, it has immunised her.

596
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:14,533
All these years, it has been growing inside her body.

597
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,952
Until it found a more suitable host.

598
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:23,257
We have the original strain. 
Prepare everything for the procedure.

599
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:27,345
We need to get this thing out of her.
It's not too late.

600
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,058
Ma'am.

601
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:39,895
Ma'am, we need to go join the others.

602
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,560
Come with me.

603
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,003
No, no, no.

604
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,395
Ha! Fuckers!.

605
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,649
Don't move.

606
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:33,863
Drop your weapon and turn around.

607
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,786
Where is the reporter?

608
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,374
On a cruise.

609
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,634
For the last time.

610
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:54,925
Where is she?

611
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,062
- What's going on? Did he not answer?
- No.

612
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,973
And he's not going to either.

613
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05,560
Then we'll go down ourselves and turn on the engine.

614
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:09,196
Sure. Easy as pie. But I won't go out there.

615
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,739
Would you rather wait for these creatures to come here?

616
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,495
This is my last trip.

617
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:21,660
If anyone wants to go home, it's me.
But I want to get there alive.

618
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:25,497
Open up!

619
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:27,332
- Lucas!
- Open up.

620
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,472
What is this?

621
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:37,725
Nobody touch her. Step away from her.

622
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:41,013
- What's going on here?
- It's a parasite. It's inside of her.

623
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:44,311
- This parasite is the origin of the virus.
- I beg your pardon?

624
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,397
- What did you say?
- The video shows it clearly.

625
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,779
You can watch it if you like.

626
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:51,773
What nonsense are you talking now?

627
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,317
- She is clean.
- She is indeed.

628
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:59,494
This thing immunises its host, so it can go undetected.

629
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:03,159
- Easy now, we need her alive.
- Let go of her!

630
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:15,172
- You're making a mistake.
- I said, let go of her.

631
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:20,135
- Your gun isn't loaded.
- But this one is.

632
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:25,895
You don't seem to understand.
The parasite is the original strain.

633
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:29,937
We can't get the serum without it.
It's the only way.

634
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:33,861
- I don't give a damn.
- Please, be reasonable.

635
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,902
We'll take it out of her without doing her any harm.

636
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:38,991
No, don't believe a single word.

637
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,325
You're a doctor.

638
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:44,371
You know only too well that this is our only chance.

639
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:45,960
No.

640
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,045
No.

641
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,510
No!

642
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:58,222
- It's too far to the laboratory. 
- We'll use the table.

643
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,716
- Quick.
- No!

644
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:02,219
- Hurry up.
- Nick! Nick!

645
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:03,932
Careful.

646
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:06,806
No, don't. No! No!

647
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,351
- On her back.
- Help!

648
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,732
Hold on tight.

649
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,866
Restrain her. Very good.

650
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:23,365
Wait. What if you're wrong?

651
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:27,369
Like I said, you can watch the video yourself.

652
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:30,167
- Time is running out.
- Nick.

653
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:31,505
Release her.

654
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:35,092
- I can't find it. 
- It must be there.

655
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,836
Here, doctor.

656
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:56,318
Hold her head. Focus.

657
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,653
There.

658
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,077
- I need towels.
- In the bathroom.

659
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,873
Come on, quickly!

660
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,306
Quick. Here, hold her tight.

661
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,724
What is going on here?

662
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:34,064
No. No!

663
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:42,323
- Help me, goddamnit!
- I'm out of ammo.

664
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,081
Shoot already! Shoot!

665
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:48,450
- What is it?
- No idea.

666
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,553
Grab her! Do it!

667
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,009
Fire!

668
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,137
Shoot already!

669
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:14,567
Hold her! She must not escape.

670
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:49,010
It's just a scratch. It's nothing.

671
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:51,558
No.

672
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:53,731
Wait.

673
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:57,769
The strain works. You said it yourself.

674
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:00,905
We can synthesise the serum now.

675
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:03,400
There is no time. You know that.

676
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:08,120
You still need me.

677
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:11,199
No.

678
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:21,384
- Now what? 
- Now we're looking for the reporter.

679
01:01:21,553 --> 01:01:23,385
No, the game is over.

680
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:27,094
You're going to call for help now. 
You're the only one who can operate the radio.

681
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:31,310
- Not without the serum.
- You'll never get it.

682
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,471
If we don't get it,

683
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:37,062
We won't be returning anywhere.

684
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:40,603
Come on, we're out of time.

685
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:47,076
Set your radio frequency to nine.
She can't be far.

686
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,352
Shit.

687
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:27,734
That's it. I've had it. 
Can you steer the ship?

688
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:33,160
I can try. I've helped a few times.

689
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:43,291
We'll go down. Do you know how to 
turn on the auxiliary engine?

690
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:46,885
I think so. But I'm not going down there.

691
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:50,344
With four knives we won't get far.

692
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:53,225
- Cut the crap.
- Do you have a better idea?

693
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:57,605
Wait. In the chest at the fore-deck
is fishing equipment.

694
01:02:57,816 --> 01:02:59,682
Oh great, now we go fishing.

695
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:02,648
You stay here. We'll go have a look.

696
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:06,939
When we get back, we're off to the engine room.

697
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,444
Close up behind us.
You're the only one who can steer the ship.

698
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:20,537
That's the fore-deck.

699
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:25,674
This is a fucking maze.

700
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:30,759
There. There she is.

701
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:47,150
I have her. She's at the cabins.

702
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:50,024
- Where?
<i>- In the hallway to the cabins.</i>

703
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:51,692
Quick, get moving!

704
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:09,419
Shit, she's destroying the cameras!

705
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,595
<i>I lost her.</i>

706
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:21,642
Where is she?

707
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:27,069
Goddamn fucking shit!

708
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,013
I see her. She's going to the dining room.

709
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,432
Go.Go!

710
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:12,740
<i>She's in the corridor to the dining room. 
Hurry!</i>

711
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:19,363
<i>√Ångela, no. Over here.</i>

712
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:22,958
It's me, Nick. Pick up the radio.

713
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,461
<i>Now take it already.</i>

714
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:29,832
<i>Come on, √Ångela. Pick it up.</i>

715
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,843
<i>Okay, now press seven.</i>

716
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:36,589
Press the seven. Come on, do it.

717
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:41,185
- Nick?
- Now we can talk. I see you.

718
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,220
<i>If you destroy the cameras,</i>

719
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:44,642
I can't do anything.

720
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:48,267
- Ok.
<i>- Run away. They're after you.</i>

721
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:51,229
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

722
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:52,605
They're almost there.

723
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:59,112
<i>What are you doing?
They'll be there any moment.</i>

724
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,573
<i>√Ångela, listen to me.</i>

725
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:04,200
You need to get away immediately.

726
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:05,959
Go on.

727
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:14,794
Why are you doing this?

728
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:20,098
- You go inside.
- Alright.

729
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:30,192
- Go, go, go!
- Here, take this.

730
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,611
- What are you doing, Lucas?
- Wait!

731
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,234
Come on, come on!

732
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,411
Let's get this party started.

733
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:45,328
Where is she? 
How could she have escaped us?

734
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:47,417
- We already had her.
- Be careful.

735
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:51,168
Where the hell is she hiding?

736
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:57,970
Help!

737
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:00,343
Help me!

738
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:04,431
Do something! The fire extinguisher!

739
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,725
Take the fire extinguisher! Come on!

740
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:10,941
Quick!

741
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:14,020
Help!

742
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,149
- I have no idea what I'm doing.
- Hit him over the head!

743
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:31,370
You are wrong.

744
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:36,005
I know what you want from me, 
but you're wrong.

745
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:48,221
You can check it now.

746
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:52,479
Go back to your fucking laboratory and check it.

747
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,193
And then leave me alone.

748
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,204
I'm sorry.

749
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:17,708
- And now? We have no more weapons.
- You can leave.

750
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:19,296
Wait.

751
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:22,217
What's that on your hand?

752
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,803
You've been bitten.

753
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:41,027
No! Don't!

754
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:56,459
BEGIN ANALYSIS

755
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:59,216
DATA PROCESSING IN PROGRESS

756
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,686
Nick? Nick, are you there?

757
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:16,691
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

758
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:19,899
Trust me. I need the code to the lab.

759
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:22,067
What?

760
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:25,489
I need to prove to them that they're wrong.

761
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,153
Please.

762
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:30,243
<i>But you bit him. I saw it.</i>

763
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:31,702
Trust me, Nick.

764
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:36,420
<i>We can leave here together, but I need the code.</i>

765
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,255
I beg you.

766
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,460
<i>Nick.</i>

767
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:45,129
Alright. I'll give it to you.

768
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:51,344
<i>Guzm√°n has taught me how to
film it with the security camera.</i>

769
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:55,185
<i>Here it is. I hope you know what you're doing.</i>

770
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,320
This can't be.

771
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,003
It can't be.

772
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:23,000
- But it is so.
- But I've seen it myself.

773
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:26,720
<i>- It has entered your body.<i>
- I don't care.

774
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,347
<i>I'm not the one you're looking for.<i>

775
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:00,959
- Harpoons.
- Right, harpoons.

776
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:02,668
And nothing else?

777
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:06,585
- I see.
- Alright.

778
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:09,506
We go down there, and you turn on the engine.

779
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:10,923
Then it's time to go home.

780
01:11:11,184 --> 01:11:13,346
Wait. √Ångela is clean.

781
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:17,096
Ricarte has checked it.
I've seen it through the cameras.

782
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:20,398
She's in the laboratory.
We need to go get her.

783
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:26,150
Alright, I'll go. 
You two go to the engine room.

784
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:27,860
We meet here.

785
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:36,331
- Say it.
- It's impossible.

786
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:40,293
- There must be a mistake.
- There is no mistake!

787
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:46,216
You are to stay away from me, or I'll kill you!

788
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:48,381
Tell them! Now!

789
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:49,924
Say what?

790
01:11:56,687 --> 01:12:00,852
The parasite leaves the host
when it finds a more suitable one.

791
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:04,109
Hidden inside her, it was able to make it out of the building.

792
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:07,563
The video proves it. We've seen it.

793
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:11,324
I don't care. Your analysis says otherwise.

794
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,907
If she were the host, you'd be infected.

795
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:17,789
- She bit you.
- I'm well aware of that.

796
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:20,827
But there must be an explanation.

797
01:12:22,797 --> 01:12:24,754
You're playing us for fools.

798
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:32,429
Is that true, √Ångela? Are you deceiving us?

799
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:38,977
What about you? Perhaps you're the one deceiving us?

800
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:44,274
Why did you want the code to the lab?

801
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:49,150
You asked Nick for it. Why?

802
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:51,365
I wanted to know what was in there.

803
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:56,195
When I met you, you came straight from the lab, right?

804
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,078
You released the monkey.

805
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:05,497
Oh, really? And why would I have done that?

806
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:11,381
You saved me from the building.

807
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:14,797
We were alone for almost a minute.

808
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,601
If this thing was inside of me ...

809
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:24,977
It leaves its host when it finds a better one.

810
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,726
- Isn't that right?
- Right.

811
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:32,815
The old host is then discarded.

812
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:42,824
You are very brave, √Ångela. I admire that.

813
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,042
<i>Emergency destruct activated.</i>

814
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,454
20 minutes to go.

815
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,129
- It's over.
- Die!

816
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:10,977
Where do you think you're going, √Ångela?

817
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:16,408
Careful, don't hurt yourself with that.

818
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,182
<i>Evacuate immediately.</i>

819
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,392
Now the party's really starting.

820
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:49,774
<i>18 minutes left until detonation.</i>

821
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:52,106
<i>Evacuate immediately.</i>

822
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:55,064
No!

823
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,801
Stop.

824
01:16:58,864 --> 01:16:59,945
Go back!

825
01:17:03,244 --> 01:17:04,485
Finish him!

826
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:23,757
Let's go, Nick. Go!

827
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:34,017
Go, go.

828
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:36,774
This way.

829
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:41,487
- Here?
- Yes.

830
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:44,741
- Quick.
- Shit.

831
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:46,651
What is it?

832
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:50,037
- Nick, what's wrong?
- It won't work.

833
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:52,699
Why not? You said you could do it.

834
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,078
- I said I could try.
- Now, come on!

835
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:15,100
- Quick, hurry!
- Yes.

836
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:18,017
Come on! Fuck.

837
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:20,360
Damn!

838
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:22,604
Shit.

839
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:25,444
Gimme that.

840
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:30,953
- Go, Nick!
- Shit!

841
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:32,869
Turn it on!

842
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,302
Help me, Nick!

843
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:52,718
Go, Nick!

844
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:02,978
- No, no. Please don't.
- Nick!

845
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:14,202
<i>Evacuate immediately.
13 minutes left until detonation.</i>

846
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:16,992
<i>Evacuate immediately.</i>

847
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:25,501
<i>Evacuate immediately.

848

<i>Evacuate immediately.

849
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:28,817
<i>Evacuate immediately.</i>

850
01:20:30,284 --> 01:20:33,118
No, don't. I'm healthy. I'm clean.

851
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:37,447
- Where is Angela?
- I don’t know. Let's get out of here.

852
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:40,204
The ship is going to explode.

853
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:45,205
Look, over here.
That's an inflatable lifeboat.

854
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:48,630
- We can use the engine. 
- Where is Angela?

855
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:53,221
Forget her. It's too late. 
You must think of yourself.

856
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:58,017
Us two can make it off this ship.

857
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,897
Really.

858
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:05,854
Kiss my ass.

859
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:15,697
Great, Nick.

860
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:26,964
<i>Evacuate immediately.
8 minutes left until detonation.</i>

861
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:28,498
Fuck.

862
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:47,184
Angela!

863
01:21:48,195 --> 01:21:50,187
Monkeys!

864
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:09,668
Shit.

865
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:15,886
We have to go. This thing is going to blow.

866
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:18,048
Oh shit!

867
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:20,012
- No!
- Come on, to the dining room.

868
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:33,024
They're gone.

869
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:46,250
- Do you hear anything?
- No.

870
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:53,133
<i>Evacuate immediately.
6 minutes left until detonation.</i>

871
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:58,255
We need to get on deck. The time is almost up.

872
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:01,766
And the engine? Where is the engine?

873
01:23:01,935 --> 01:23:05,428
- It got wedged in. It's in the corridor.
- Damn!

874
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:06,972
Nevermind.

875
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:11,814
We hurry out, grab it and run, ok?

876
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:13,648
Alright.

877
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:16,360
One, two, three.

878
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:22,153
Did you think you could escape me?

879
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:34,545
After all we've been through together?

880
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:38,177
No, don't!

881
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:41,051
No!

882
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:47,729
No, √Ångela. I'll come with you.
I still have a lot to do.

883
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:28,887
Let's get out of here, hurry!

884
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,805
<i>4 minutes left until detonation.</i>

885
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:33,183
Go, run! Go!

886
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:35,184
<i>Evacuate immediately.</i>

887
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:48,330
Go, go!

888
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:54,587
Let's go, hurry!

889
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,467
Run!

890
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:13,810
Run!

891
01:25:18,322 --> 01:25:20,609
Give me the engine. Give it to me!

892
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:52,311
- We have to jump.
- No!

893
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:55,394
Then they'll kill us. Jump already!

894
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:56,858
No!

895
01:25:57,944 --> 01:25:59,230
I can't!

896
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:03,189
Jump!

897
01:26:07,204 --> 01:26:08,445
Nick!

898
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:15,038
Jump, Angela!

899
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:22,925
Nick!

900
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,727
Let go, Angela. Come on!

901
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:39,229
You have to let go!

902
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:08,963
Angela!

903
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:14,264
Angela!

904
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:20,061
Angela!

905
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:54,972
- Nick!
- Here! Take my hand!

906
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:03,484
Take my hand!

907
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:12,951
Take my hand, √Ångela.

908
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:37,393
Go.

909
01:28:38,772 --> 01:28:40,308
Will you start already!

910
01:28:41,191 --> 01:28:45,435
- Shit, it won't start.
- Come on, we need to get out of here!

911
01:29:59,019 --> 01:30:01,602
<i>One car to Hotel Plaza please.</i>

912
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:04,810
I'm dropping off two passengers
in the center, then I'm headed there.

913
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,232
Guess that was some pretty wild party, huh?
