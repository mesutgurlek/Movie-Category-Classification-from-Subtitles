1
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,948
It won't be so funny
if we end up in a Romanian jail.

2
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,474
Relax. Nobody's been up here in years.

3
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,238
Oh, Christ.

4
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,316
This way?

5
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,958
- Where?
- It's up there?

6
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,234
Hey, you sure it's up there?

7
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,158
He's sure.

8
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,913
He'd better be right. You tell him.

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,116
Come on. Let's get the stuff.

10
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,318
Ye of little faith.

11
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,038
<i>Should be a gold mine. </i>

12
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,918
Why the hell
would they build a church out here?

13
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,719
Check this.

14
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,716
Here we go.

15
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,234
My God. Look at the walls.

16
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,478
There's nothing here.

17
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,836
<i>- So. Where's the cave?</i>
- You're standing on it.

18
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,313
So, how do we get in?

19
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,591
Fire in the hole.

20
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,036
Perfect. Let's go.

21
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,593
Shut up.

22
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,636
Shut up!

23
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,790
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

24
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,356
You know what? It's more than a cave.

25
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,795
This one could run deeper than Postojna.

26
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,673
Oh, look at this.

27
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,676
If this is what I think it is,

28
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,910
it's going to be a fantastic find.

29
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,956
<i>Let's have a look at it, shall we?</i>

30
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,309
<i>Yeah. </i>

31
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,518
Hear that? Running water. It's a good sign.

32
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,716
Nic?

33
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,909
<i>Come. Have a look at this. </i>

34
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,436
We're going to need cave divers.

35
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,476
I know just who to call.

36
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,992
No picture, Charlie.
This antenna's a piece of junk.

37
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,911
<i>- How's that?</i>
- Got it.

38
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,152
Strodey! Get your skinny ass down here!

39
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,471
Boys. You found it yet?

40
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,358
No. We looked exactly where
your sonic mapping said we should.

41
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,193
Jesus! My kids could get in and find it
quicker than you two.

42
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,759
- Ready, Top?
- Yeah.

43
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,399
Jack and Tyler back yet?

44
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,038
Not yet.

45
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,112
<i>That's Tyler's unit. He found it. </i>

46
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,276
Bastard did it again.

47
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,994
Jack's gonna be pissed.
He called time five minutes ago.

48
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,556
You don't have to say anything.
I know I was stupid, but... we got it.

49
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,154
Hey, I call time, and you surface.

50
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,196
OK.

51
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,952
<i>- How's that? You got a signal there yet?</i>
- Not yet, Strodey.

52
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,279
<i>- And now?</i>
<i>- Yeah. </i>

53
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,509
Yeah.

54
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,715
<i>- Dr. Nicolai. </i>
<i>- Hello. </i>

55
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,119
Hey. It's Jack.

56
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,112
- You got some good news?
<i>- Yeah. I've got the funding. </i>

57
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,191
You do? Really?

58
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,238
<i>We've done the surface scans. </i>
<i>The cave is huge, Jack. </i>

59
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,595
<i>There is a river off the main cavern,</i>

60
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,713
<i>and there's nowhere it can come out</i>
<i>for at least 19 miles. </i>

61
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,598
Sounds like the Amazon
of underground rivers, huh?

62
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,468
<i>Dr. Jennings our biologist is bringing</i>
<i>a cameraman to shoot the whole thing. </i>

63
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,676
<i>But, you know, it's gonna be tough. </i>

64
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,228
<i>Which is why I need your team</i>
<i>and need you to run the show. </i>

65
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,197
Great! When do we start?

66
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,077
<i>We want to start right away. </i>

67
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,718
<i>We're in a hundred percent. </i>

68
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,236
<i>That's great, Jack. </i>
<i>I can't wait to see you here. Ciao!</i>

69
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,276
- Thanks, Dr. Nicolai.
- Bye!

70
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,990
Good to finally meet you, Dr. Nicolai.

71
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,958
<i>Let me show you around. </i>
<i>- Please. </i>

72
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,995
What have we got?

73
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,436
That's the main cave, hidden under the church
and half the mountainside.

74
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,316
- Tyler?
- Yeah?

75
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,311
Everything made it OK.

76
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,551
Take a look at this mix computer.
It got a little banged up.

77
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,669
Oh, man. Yep.

78
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,036
All right. Break it down,
and reinstall the programming.

79
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,633
<i>Whoa!</i>

80
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,035
Hello.

81
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,195
<i>I'm just gonna go visit with a fellow scientist. </i>

82
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,114
- Hi.
- Hi.

83
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,437
I'm Tyler McAlister. I'm the first scout.

84
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,112
One second.

85
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,871
- Do you mind if I...
- Sorry. Let me just move this for you.

86
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,749
- Dr. Jennings.
- It's good to meet you.

87
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,353
And this is Alex Kim our cameraman.

88
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,158
Oh, yeah. I've seen your work.

89
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,753
Heard a lot about you, too.

90
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,308
So, it's unusual for a rebreather.

91
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,630
- Who modified it?
- That would be my brother Jack.

92
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,950
- Really?
- Yep.

93
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,076
I did all the reprogramming, though.

94
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,834
Why the canister?

95
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,071
We're using lithium hydroxide
to filter out the CO2.

96
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,517
It's a little dangerous,
but it's much more effective than calcium.

97
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,431
Hope you got a redundancy for this Meg.

98
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,308
There's actually a triple redundancy.
It's the backup, a primary, and a HUD.

99
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,393
So you can stay submerged for what,
18, 20 hours?

100
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,879
24.

101
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,355
Kate. Alex. This is Jack McAlister.

102
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,078
- Dr. Jennings.
- It's a pleasure.

103
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,755
We read about some of
your Yucatan expeditions. Pretty amazing.

104
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,989
Thank you, thank you.

105
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,436
I understand you have a great interest
in cave biology, Mr. McAllister.

106
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,475
I'm starting to.

107
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,916
- And it's just Jack, please.
- Kathryn.

108
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,958
- Perhaps you want to see some samples?
- Yeah, sure.

109
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,635
Hey, bro.
Double-check all the rebreathers, will you?

110
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,631
Yeah. One in 14.

111
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,278
One in 14?

112
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,715
It's the number of cave divers that die each year.

113
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,355
What's this?

114
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,149
It's all that's left of some poor guy
they found in the mouth of the cave.

115
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,036
Tyler? Let's go.

116
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,910
So how did you hook up with these guys?

117
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,675
My dad had a dive business
in North Florida,

118
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,196
and when Jack got out of high school,
he kind of took him under his wing.

119
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,239
- We're all kind of like family.
- And Tyler?

120
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,316
He joined the business out of college.

121
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,989
Briggs we found table-dancing
in a club outside Calgary.

122
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,149
All right, everybody, listen up. Here we go.

123
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,629
<i>- You all right, Strode?</i>
- Yeah, good, man.

124
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,395
I've been analyzing these read-outs,
and here's what we got.

125
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,075
There's an enormous cavern about
300 feet down, just below the cave entrance.

126
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,154
- Dr. Nicolai has already named it Titan Hall.
- Oh, yeah, it's huge, believe me.

127
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,549
There's a sump... Strode?

128
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,596
...right about here,

129
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,956
which then leads
to this underwater passageway.

130
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,598
<i>Look who's here. </i>

131
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,274
<i>We need to find a dry cavern</i>
<i>somewhere in the system</i>

132
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,396
where we can set up advance base camp,

133
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,711
<i>and Dr. Nicolai and Kathryn</i>
<i>can gather their samples. </i>

134
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,519
We'll be under for 12 days.
We're gonna go deep on this one.

135
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,478
- Yeah!
<i>- All right. </i>

136
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,959
Top, anything you want to add?

137
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,113
Everybody just remember, now -
this cave is a very serious piece of work.

138
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,031
<i>It's already taken at least one life. </i>

139
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,031
Respect the cave.

140
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,630
Briggs, you're gonna take first scout.

141
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,312
Ouch.

142
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,719
<i>Right on. </i>

143
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,155
<i>Any questions? All right, listen. </i>

144
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,958
<i>A toast. </i>

145
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,037
- To virgin caves.
To virgin caves!

146
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,792
Cheers. Thank you very much.

147
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,438
To virgin everything.

148
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,159
They built the church to seal the cave
as a display of God's protective power.

149
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,038
Now, try to imagine...

150
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,430
these Knights Templar entering the cave,

151
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,988
and according to the local legend,

152
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,039
fighting these winged demons.

153
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,953
- Demons, huh?
<i>- Yeah. </i>

154
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,792
Well? Did they win?

155
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,758
Unfortunately, no.

156
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,796
European legends always have sad endings.

157
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,873
There you go.

158
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,679
Oh, yeah.

159
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,558
<i>The ladder is quite safe. </i>

160
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,790
- Yeah, I hate ladders.
- Whoa!

161
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,350
Next thing you know they're putting in elevators.

162
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,714
She's such a show-off.

163
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,316
It's the only way to go, doc.

164
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,436
Whoo!

165
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,959
Oh, man.

166
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,996
<i>Titan Hall. </i>

167
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,036
<i>It's awesome. </i>

168
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,073
<i>Pre-dive checklist. O2 sensors calibrated?</i>

169
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,639
Calibrated, check.

170
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,119
Oxygen running 0.4?

171
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,758
0.4. Check.

172
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,957
Now, you find it, you name it. Make it good.

173
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,953
First scout's privilege. I got a few ideas.
You know I'll come up with something good.

174
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,669
OK. Synchronize watches to 0811 on my mark.

175
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,992
Three, two, one, mark.

176
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,038
- All OK?
- I don't think it could be any better, Ty.

177
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,953
- Yeah, I bet.
- All right. Here we go.

178
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,157
This is a long passage,
so I want you to pace yourself now.

179
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,389
Yeah.

180
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,278
Turnaround's one-third, OK?

181
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,552
If I find a dry cavern, I'll give you a call, Jack.

182
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,393
- You'd do that, would you?
- Go and get it!

183
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,632
<i>How's it looking down there?</i>

184
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,836
It's dark, it's deep, and it's wet, Jack.

185
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,480
<i>Give us your current depth. </i>

186
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,394
<i>- Depth at 162.</i>

187
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,596
What's your gas reading?

188
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,114
<i>O2's reading 1800.</i>

189
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,589
<i>So, how you feeling down there, Briggs?</i>

190
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,069
<i>I'm feeling pretty good. </i>
<i>How you feeling up there?</i>

191
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,275
I'm all right.

192
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,555
<i>How about the warning lights?</i>
<i>How do they look?</i>

193
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,313
<i>Nothing yet. There's a curve</i>
<i>in the tunnel up ahead, though. </i>

194
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,278
<i>Probably gonna lose you guys</i>
<i>on the dark side of the moon. </i>

195
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,512
<i>Tell Tyler I'll give him a call from first base camp</i>
<i>after I set up that fiber optic. </i>

196
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,480
You know, Briggs,
I'd warn you not to be so arrogant,

197
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,755
but then you'd have no personality at all.

198
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,796
<i>Come on, Top. Take away the arrogance... </i>

199
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,996
<i>There he goes. </i>
- That's it.

200
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,638
Thanks, Strode.

201
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,679
We need you ready around 0100 hours,
all right?

202
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,954
Oh, I've <i>been</i> ready.

203
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,039
You got something to say, say it.

204
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,873
- You know I'm the best scout.
<i>- Maybe so. </i>

205
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,394
But I can count on Briggs.

206
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,150
First scout consolation prize.

207
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,755
- Yeah.
- You wish it was you in there?

208
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,828
I just wanna be first
in a place nobody's ever been.

209
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,990
Well, you and I aren't that different.

210
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,789
I mean, if I find something unique,
I want to put my name on it.

211
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,313
So, what happened?

212
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,119
- It's my brother's call.
<i>Hey, Ty!</i>

213
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,194
Checked the line three times. There's nothing
wrong with it. We just don't have a signal.

214
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,396
Check every five minutes till we get something.

215
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,754
<i>What's up?</i>

216
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,675
- If he doesn't show in ten, I'm sending you in.
- It's Briggs. He's probably just showing off.

217
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,594
Listen, you're probably right,
but go get ready anyways, OK?

218
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,591
Jack!

219
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,432
- Guys! I got him.
<i>- Wakey, wakey. </i>

220
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,750
<i>Titan Hall! Is anybody there?</i>

221
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,319
<i>All right. Get up!</i>

222
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,630
Morning. We're all here, buddy. Where are you?

223
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,554
<i>Good morning to you too, Top. </i>
<i>I'd say I'm sitting at advance base camp,</i>

224
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,519
<i>which will now be forever known</i>
<i>as... Kublai Khan. </i>

225
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,670
About how far in would you say, Briggs?

226
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,030
<i>Oh... only about... </i>

227
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,076
<i>2.4 miles, Jack. </i>

228
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,470
- Fantastic!
- 2.4!

229
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,109
<i>I'm uploading the data now. </i>
<i>Read it and weep. </i>

230
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,236
<i>It's amazing in here, man. </i>

231
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,436
<i>I haven't seen a hole like this in a long time. </i>

232
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,078
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

233
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,072
- Briggs!
<i>- Yeah. Hold on a sec. Something ran past me. </i>

234
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,628
<i> Got it!</i>

235
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,678
<i>Kathryn, can you and Nicolai see this?</i>

236
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,231
<i>It's some kind of a large rat,</i>
<i>or a mole or something. </i>

237
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,437
<i>Buck teeth, webbed feet,</i>
<i>looks a lot like Tyler. </i>

238
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,393
- You all right, man?
<i>- Shit!</i>

239
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,835
<i>Yeah. </i>

240
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,268
<i>I think I pissed him off</i>
<i>with that Tyler comment. </i>

241
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,396
Listen, man, good work. Get some sleep now.

242
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,040
<i>Yeah, yeah. Some sleep. </i>

243
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,759
- You need anything down there, man?
<i>- Hold on a sec. </i>

244
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,476
<i>Briggs?</i>

245
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,199
<i>Yeah. Yeah, hold on, guys. </i>

246
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,196
<i>- I'm gonna to try to get... </i>

247
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,191
<i>- There's something that... </i>
- Briggs?

248
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,999
- What's up, Strode?
- Could be feedback in the line.

249
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,674
<i>What was that? God damn it!</i>
- Key me if you can hear me.

250
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,959
Fiber optic must have snapped, huh?

251
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,429
Maybe we should send in a second scout,
to be safe.

252
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,159
No, come on. We gotta get in the water.

253
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,194
Top and I are in the water in 30 minutes.

254
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,919
Strode, Tyler, fix the cable on the way in.
Let's do it.

255
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,151
<i>Let's take it a little slow. </i>

256
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,196
<i>Break in the line could be anywhere. </i>

257
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,196
<i>Right on your tail, mate. </i>

258
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,591
<i>It's not bad, huh, Top?</i>

259
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,636
<i>Yeah, there's a lot of life in here. </i>

260
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,280
<i>You OK?</i>

261
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,909
<i>- Yeah. Just thinking about Briggs. </i>
<i>- He can take care of himself. </i>

262
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,309
<i>How long till we reach the cavern?</i>

263
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,960
<i>It's a long run, Nicolai. Enjoy the ride. </i>

264
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,708
<i>This beats anything in the Yucatan by a mile. </i>

265
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,590
<i>Hey, Kim, did you get a shot</i>
<i>of those cave draperies? Sick, dude!</i>

266
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,148
<i>I got it. </i>

267
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,636
<i>It's totally rockin'.</i>

268
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,832
<i>Dr. Nicolai. </i>
<i>You and Katherine should check this out. </i>

269
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,639
<i>Advance base camp</i>
<i>should be about 200 yards ahead. </i>

270
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,676
<i>Thank you. We'll see you there. </i>

271
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,156
Yo, Briggs!

272
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,592
Briggs!

273
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,753
Briggs!

274
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,431
Hey, Briggs!

275
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,672
About time you two ladies got here!
Come take a look at this.

276
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,070
We're not the first ones here after all.

277
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,390
Looks like somebody lost his boots.

278
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,110
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

279
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,910
<i>Tyler, hang on. </i>
<i>I'm gonna make a jump here for a second. </i>

280
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,676
<i>Strode, how you doing?</i>
<i>- Good. I think I saw one of those moles. </i>

281
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,433
<i>- Be right back. </i>
<i>- All right. I'll keep looking for the break. </i>

282
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,389
<i>Strode, I found the break right here. </i>
<i>It's gonna take me a few minutes. </i>

283
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,313
<i>Strode? Hey, Strode?</i>

284
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,960
<i>Yeah, right here. Just give me another minute. </i>

285
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,318
There's a flat area just up there
where we can set up camp.

286
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,960
Any hot showers?
That would make my day.

287
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,598
I've had enough water.

288
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,152
<i>Tyler? You still reading me, mate?</i>

289
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,196
<i>Tyler?</i>

290
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,553
<i>Whoo!</i>

291
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,637
What the hell?

292
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,069
What the...

293
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,796
Son of a bitch!

294
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,479
Hey, Tyler. Tyler, you read me?

295
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,670
<i>What the hell? Strode. </i>

296
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,911
<i>This cable looks... chewed. </i>

297
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,276
Mate, you there?

298
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,876
Argh!

299
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,878
<i>- Help! Help!</i>
- Strode? Strode!

300
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,519
<i>Strode! Can you hear me?</i>
<i>Where are you, Strode?</i>

301
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,273
<i>Tyler!</i>
Jesus! What the hell was that?

302
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,709
<i>Top!</i>

303
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,433
Tyler, Tyler, hey... You all right?

304
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,149
- Yeah. Yeah. I think so.
- Where's Strode? Huh?

305
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,719
I... I don't know.

306
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,189
- Shit! Top.
- Bring the J-bar.

307
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,238
He kept saying, "help,"
like he was being attacked, so I went back,

308
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,311
but I don't know what the hell exploded.

309
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,396
<i>At least the dive line’s intact. </i>

310
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,071
<i>Let's keep our eyes open. </i>

311
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,553
<i>Looks like the whole damn tunnel collapsed. </i>

312
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,393
<i>He's got to be in here. </i>
<i>It's the only way through. </i>

313
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,590
<i> Son of a bitch!</i>

314
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,554
<i>Jack?</i>
<i>That's his counter lung. </i>

315
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,993
<i>Oh, man, this isn't good. </i>

316
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,917
<i>Jack, look out! It's coming down!</i>

317
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,431
<i>Shit!</i>

318
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,791
<i>Jack, back on the dive line. </i>

319
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,230
All right, listen up.

320
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,357
<i>We have a few realities to face here, people. </i>

321
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,671
The first is that we're not going out
the way we came.

322
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,433
The passage is completely blocked.

323
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:20,197
The second is that
we're not even gonna be missed for 12 days,

324
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,158
which is right about when our supplies run out.

325
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,710
- So we're gonna have to find our own way out.
<i>Hold on a second!</i>

326
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,792
You still haven't told us
what happened to Strode.

327
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,189
Tyler said it sounded like
he was being attacked.

328
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,558
He was Special Forces,
for Christ's sake, Jack.

329
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,518
He knew what the hell he was doing.

330
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,479
Something got him. I'll bet you it was the
same thing that got whoever owns those boots.

331
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,914
We're all hurting, man.

332
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,560
<i>Strode was a friend to all of us. </i>

333
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,596
Don't you forget that.

334
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,360
What do you think, Dr. Nicolai?

335
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,398
Is there anything
that could have attacked Strode?

336
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,952
I don't know. The mole is the largest animal
we've seen in this type of system.

337
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,793
Our friend here does prove
there's an abundant food supply.

338
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,309
Question is, is he at the top of the food chain,
or is there something else?

339
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,277
Strode could have just screwed up his mix.

340
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,157
<i>Narcosis, hallucinations... </i>

341
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,516
It happens. I mean, he panics,
he ruptures his scooter.

342
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,750
Whatever it was, it doesn't matter now.

343
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,628
Because right now our primary concern
is getting out of here alive.

344
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,393
Jack, this is the Carpathians.

345
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,438
<i>We could spend an eternity</i>
<i>trying to find a way out. </i>

346
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,988
<i>If</i>... there even is one.

347
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,913
Come on, Jack, we wait.
A rescue team will come for us.

348
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,676
Dr. Nicolai, we're a mile below the surface
and three miles in.

349
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,956
The best people to get us out
are all right here.

350
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,352
We <i>are</i> the rescue team.

351
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:59,319
Now, here's how it's gonna go. Top and I, we're
gonna start scouting for an exit immediately.

352
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,631
Now I'd recommend that you all get some rest.
You're gonna need it.

353
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,636
<i>Top. </i>

354
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,071
I never lost anybody, Top.

355
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,311
I don't like it, Mac. Something's not right.

356
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,549
No shit, buddy.

357
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,913
Narcosis my ass!
That's bullshit and you know it.

358
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,956
I'm not getting into this.

359
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,113
Why is that, Tyler? Because you forgot
to stick with your dive buddy?

360
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,033
You asshole! I had no idea...

361
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,238
<i>Hey! You guys!</i>

362
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,312
Hey! Stop it!

363
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,436
You guys, cut it out! Stop it!

364
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,189
Hey! We just lost a friend,
and this is how you deal with it?

365
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,952
Come on.

366
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,270
Never seen a white algae bed before.

367
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,035
Yeah. Looks like we found
the base of the food chain.

368
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,997
It's not the base I'm worried about.

369
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,276
Someone made it this far.

370
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,797
Let's keep moving.

371
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,396
Nicolai. Look at this.

372
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,908
- It's a parasite.
- Mm-hm.

373
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,956
That's from the mole.

374
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,158
- Yeah.
- And this is from the salamander.

375
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,558
- It's the same parasite.
- Uh huh.

376
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,189
Think we should have tried door number two.

377
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,670
It looks like it opens up.
I'm gonna try to slip through.

378
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,672
<i>Ah, shit. Hey, Top?</i>

379
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,432
Yeah?

380
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,317
You mind backing up, bud?

381
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,636
Backing up.

382
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,916
Jack.

383
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,630
Jack!

384
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,156
Jack!

385
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,276
Jack!

386
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,233
Jack!

387
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,312
Get the medical kit!

388
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,755
I got it!
What happened?

389
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,796
Ah, shit! Look at him. You all right?

390
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,033
Top, what do you need?
Tell me! What happened, Top?

391
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,953
- Found that hooked in his sling.
- What the hell is that?

392
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,952
- I cut it off.
- Did you get a look at it?

393
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,917
- It jumped me too fast.
- Hold still.

394
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,639
- Jesus, how big was it?
- It's big.

395
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,597
- How's it looking?
- Ripped you up good.

396
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,910
Need to put you on an antibiotic.
Give me a syringe!

397
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,150
You son of a bitch!

398
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,878
<i>All right. </i>

399
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,113
There's a... There's a resemblance
to amphibian tissue,

400
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,158
but these hair follicles would seem
to rule that out.

401
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,192
I mean, the only thing I do know -
this is definitely a predator.

402
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,838
So now we're part of the food chain.

403
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,356
We always have been.
Just forgotten that, living in cities.

404
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,398
Just reflexes. Don't worry.

405
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,516
- What is it?
- Without DNA testing, it's impossible to tell.

406
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,034
<i>It may be something</i>
<i>We've never seen before. </i>

407
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:07,114
Every cave organism we've discovered so far
originated on the surface.

408
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,156
Over time, they've adapted.

409
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,791
Lost pigmentation and sight, developed
a heightened sense of hearing and smell.

410
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,320
If this is a totally self-contained ecosystem...

411
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,837
Yes, we may have discovered the primeval
creature that has evolved in total isolation.

412
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,151
Well, it looks like a piece
from those things on the mosaic.

413
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,832
Look.

414
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,036
- What?
- There.

415
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,429
<i>It's still alive?</i>

416
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,557
- Those tendrils look familiar?
- Yeah. The parasite.

417
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,756
It appears to be ubiquitous.

418
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,710
All right, let's pack it up.

419
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,913
It's time to go.

420
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,633
We should wait here.

421
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,836
Wow, that's just brilliant, doc.

422
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,879
You really wanna be sitting here on your ass
when the lights go out?

423
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,515
OK, people, take only what you need,
but keep your dive gear.

424
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,996
<i>Hey, maybe there's a way to climb out. </i>

425
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,036
Yeah, better up than down.

426
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,554
<i>Looks like we found the owner</i>
<i>of those boots. </i>

427
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,119
Teeth marks.

428
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,672
Let's go.

429
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,518
<i>Take a break right here. </i>

430
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,798
- Talk about a fork in the road, huh?
<i>A fork or a dead end?</i>

431
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,469
- Where's Jack?
<i>- Scouting the tunnel. </i>

432
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,556
So, why aren't we helping him?

433
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,155
You know the drill, Briggs.
Give him a chance to read the sediment.

434
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,471
Yeah, I know the drill, Top.
You don't have to tell me about drills.

435
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,516
Sonar gun's right here...

436
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,318
Relax.

437
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,072
What the hell's going on?

438
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,038
<i>Come on, Jack. </i>

439
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,315
Just wanna get the hell out of here.

440
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,715
Well, maybe you ought to follow me, Briggs.

441
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,915
This is bullshit.

442
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,519
<i>Jack didn't pick the dominant artery. </i>

443
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,468
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

444
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,432
This is the one right here.
Take a look at it.

445
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,440
There's something in there
that wasn't there before.

446
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,838
Well, why don't you go scout it out for us,
Briggs?

447
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,437
Forget about it.

448
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,316
On belay.

449
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,476
<i>You're safe to climb. </i>

450
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,274
You gotta let me change that bandage
when we get to the top.

451
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,554
I'm all right.

452
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,429
Looks like it's getting infected. You sure?

453
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,956
How many expeditions
we been on together, Top?

454
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,110
Too many.

455
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,556
We need a break.
Not with that thing out there.

456
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,596
You gotta let them rest, Jack.

457
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,595
- Once we hit the water.
- The water?

458
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,240
- I don't hear any water, Jack.
<i>- Yeah. </i>

459
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,231
I smell it.

460
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,592
Not now.

461
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,716
We're gonna need footage like this.

462
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,155
- Get that camera out of my face!
<i>- Hold on a second. </i>

463
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,390
Hey, hey. Quit...

464
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,118
<i>That camera paid for this expedition. </i>
- Alex.

465
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,631
I'm sorry.

466
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,398
Sorry.

467
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,436
Yeah.

468
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,559
There's a current.

469
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,753
Grab some food. You two keep an eye out.

470
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,832
<i>We'll rest for 20.</i>

471
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,076
I'm getting a little worried.
Gangrene might be setting in.

472
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,039
- I don't think those antibiotics are working.
- What should we do?

473
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,237
- Not sure we can do anything.
Maybe I should talk to him?

474
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,630
I've never seen Jack like this before.
He's completely losing it.

475
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,439
We're five miles in.
We're not going back.

476
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,478
That's for sure.
Jack's the most experienced one.

477
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,233
If anyone can get us out, it's him.
Come on!

478
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,515
We don't know where the hell we're going.

479
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,919
How you doing?

480
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,156
Jack...

481
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,196
I'm worried about you.

482
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,196
Briggs is gonna be a problem.

483
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,236
You know that, don't you?

484
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,673
I can't save them, Tyler,
if they don't trust me.

485
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,956
I'm gonna need your help with that.

486
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,436
You understand?

487
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,476
OK.

488
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,350
<i>All right. Let's get in the water. </i>

489
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,597
<i>Let's not get too spread out. </i>
<i>Everybody should be in the water by now. </i>

490
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,672
<i>I'm in now. </i>
<i>Top and Tyler are right behind me. </i>

491
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,397
- Top, if Jack gets any worse...
- I know.

492
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,436
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

493
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,990
<i>The current's pushing us up. </i>

494
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,593
<i>Yeah, I feel it. </i>

495
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,830
<i>Looks like it's pretty choppy up there. </i>

496
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,916
All right, listen up. Secure all your gear.

497
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,198
- Jack, we don't know where the rapids go.
- What do you want to do, go back?

498
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,590
- She's right. We should find another way.
- This is the goddamn way!

499
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,035
- I'll go first.
<i>- Yeah, get going. </i>

500
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,390
- All right, Dr. Nicolai, you're coming with me.
- You'll be fine, all right? Come on.

501
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,948
Tyler, you take Kathryn. Let's go!

502
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,996
Briggs, Charlie, go now!

503
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,150
Jack!

504
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,835
Argh!

505
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,070
<i>Dr. Nicolai!</i>

506
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,116
Here.

507
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,789
<i>Now put your goggles on, and hang onto me. </i>

508
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,676
Here we go.

509
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,753
Your brother's got a serious death wish.

510
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,230
Listen to me. You have to trust him, OK?
We will get out.

511
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,117
It's OK. You'll be fine. Come on.

512
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,955
I'm stuck!

513
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,951
- What is it?
- Tyler, something has me!

514
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,873
- Cut your harness free!
- Tyler!

515
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,918
- Kathryn, the current's too strong!
- Ty, I'm stuck!

516
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,119
- I can't get back!
- Ty!

517
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,519
Kathryn!

518
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,556
Tyler!

519
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,638
<i>Tyler!</i>

520
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,039
Tyler!

521
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,991
My God!

522
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,034
Tyler!

523
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,588
<i>Help me!</i>

524
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,234
What happened? You OK?

525
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,276
- Something had me back there.
- You hurt?

526
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,316
I'm OK. I'm OK.

527
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,118
There's something in the water!

528
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,756
Oh, shit! It's some kind of eel.

529
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,272
<i>Does anybody have eyes on</i>
<i>Dr. Nicolai or Charlie?</i>

530
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,669
Yeah, I got Charlie and Kathryn.

531
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,991
Nicolai's wracked up on the rocks
above the falls. He's in bad shape.

532
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,752
All right. Flare's coming up. Top.

533
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,515
I see 'em.

534
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,559
Yeah, looks like a couple of hundred yards.
All right. Come on. Come on.

535
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,876
<i>Alex, you all right?</i>

536
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,157
- Well, that was a great idea.
- You're alive, aren't you?

537
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,355
<i>Jack. </i>

538
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,312
- Everyone all right?
- Yeah.

539
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,356
Stick close together.

540
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:25,828
That's Dr. Nicolai.
Top, light another one. I'm gonna go after him.

541
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,316
Help me!

542
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,796
<i>Nicolai!</i>

543
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,757
I'm here!

544
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,958
Nicolai!

545
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,560
- Nicolai!
- Everybody stay put!

546
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,758
Nicolai!

547
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,070
- We have to help him!
- No! Everybody in a circle!

548
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:15,119
- Backs to the centre.
We have to help him! Nicolai!

549
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,396
Dr. Nicolai?

550
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,794
We can't just sit here.
There's got to be a shore close.

551
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,996
Nobody's going anywhere till Jack gets back.

552
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,510
What was that? You hear that?

553
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:05,114
Oh, shit! What the hell was that?

554
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,115
Get back in a circle!
- I can't take this! God!

555
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,630
Nicolai!

556
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,711
Nicolai!

557
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,119
It's over.

558
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,316
Let's get the hell out of the water.

559
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,393
He said he didn't want to go deeper, Jack!
He was your responsibility!

560
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,631
He said he didn't want to go deeper.

561
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,676
It's over, Kathryn.

562
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,675
There's a ledge here. We can walk.

563
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,518
- What the hell is that?
- Echolocation.

564
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:46,071
This thing can probably see us as easily
as a bat sees a moth in complete darkness.

565
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,470
Wait here. I'm gonna scout ahead.

566
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,033
It's a strong current.
It's definitely worth a try.

567
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,473
Yeah.

568
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,594
That's gotta come up on the surface.

569
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,791
I'm not sure I like the idea of deep water
right now.

570
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,514
<i>Tyler. </i>

571
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,511
You and I are going up this wall.

572
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,990
But this is the main water flow.
We just follow it out of the system.

573
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,550
When we get to the top, we'll secure ropes.
The rest of you come up on ascenders.

574
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,710
Jack, I'm the best climber. I'll go first.

575
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,554
Nobody's climbing anywhere. There's
a huge exit sign right here in front of us...

576
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,473
You don't have a goddamn clue what's going on.

577
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,674
None of you do.

578
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,432
It's a trap.

579
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,116
- The wall's the safest option.
- Jack's right. I'll go.

580
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,838
I said no.

581
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,592
Let's go.

582
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,799
You see that?

583
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,189
<i>That's where we're going. </i>

584
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,840
- I'll route the left. Let's do it.
- All right.

585
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,438
A little insurance for you guys.

586
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:29,036
We bored out these propane valves.
Should give you a nice flame for four or five feet.

587
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,317
Scare anything that tries to come close.
Enough for a couple of blasts.

588
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,470
- Kim, give me a hand with this.
- Yeah.

589
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,269
Jack's ill, Tyler. He's not fit to lead anymore.

590
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,037
- He's not the man we started with.
- He's my brother.

591
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,119
Charlie!

592
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,116
<i>I told you no!</i>

593
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,556
Hey, be careful!
- Get the rope.

594
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,995
Get your ass back down here, Charlie!

595
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,469
I'll be all right!

596
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,477
<i>The girl's quick, man. Get the rope. </i>
<i>OK, I'm on belay. </i>

597
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,512
Let's find a route. Let's go!

598
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,316
Top, you got it?

599
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,709
<i>Damn, that girl moves fast. </i>

600
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,756
<i>Be careful up there, Charlie!</i>

601
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,159
<i>Charlie!</i>

602
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,799
<i>Charlie. You got good holds to your right. </i>

603
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,394
<i>- Keep moving right. </i>

604
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,314
<i>I think she’s over the edge. </i>
<i>All right!</i>

605
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,996
How the heck are we gonna follow that?
<i>She went over the bump. She's good. </i>

606
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,036
<i>I can't even see her. </i>

607
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,951
<i>I got it here. Keep feeding it out. </i>

608
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,395
There we go.

609
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,998
<i>How's it holding?</i>
<i>How's it holding, Tyler?</i>

610
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,036
<i>Looks good. </i>

611
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,670
Safe!

612
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,715
<i>Talk to me, Charlie. What's going on?</i>

613
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,319
<i>Is the line set? Ready to climb, Charlie. </i>

614
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,236
<i>Charlie?</i>

615
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:02,677
Jack, I'm over the edge. I can feel a draught.

616
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,399
I'm going up.
Go for it.

617
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,677
What's going on, Charlie?

618
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,833
<i>You safe, Charlie?</i>

619
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,148
<i>Charlie?</i>

620
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,399
Charlie!

621
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,393
<i>Charlie!</i>

622
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,673
Charlie, talk to me!

623
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,079
<i>Charlie!</i>

624
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,397
Get me down!

625
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,438
<i>- It's up here!</i>
- Get that rope free!

626
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,909
- Jack!
- I'm going up!

627
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,319
Come on, guys! Come on!

628
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:04,150
Get me down! Save me!

629
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,958
Move!

630
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,759
Charlie!

631
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,756
They fly! They freakin' fly!

632
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,194
No!

633
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,078
Charlie!

634
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,878
There's enough secured rope
to make it to the opening.

635
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,118
What's happening to you?

636
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:20,756
As long as we stay together as a group,
we can hold them back.

637
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,029
I think I know now.

638
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,670
- It's a parasite.
- That's from a parasite?

639
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:33,197
It mutates the host so they can both survive
down here in this environment.

640
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,750
- And that's what's gonna happen to all of us?
- I don't know, Alex.

641
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,198
I'd say...

642
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,840
it entered your bloodstream
through one of your cuts.

643
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,000
Jack, it's affecting your nervous system.

644
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,640
So the other cavers? It happened to them.

645
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,592
- So, what? It just ate them?
- No.

646
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,116
They weren't eaten by the creatures.

647
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,952
They <i>are</i> the creatures. Right, Jack?

648
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,996
<i>And now there's nothing human left. </i>

649
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:05,391
They're enjoying this, Kathryn.

650
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,596
So now you understand them, Jack?

651
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,355
Jack. Jack, you're gonna be fine.

652
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,477
- You've gotten us this far.
- Got us this far, Tyler?

653
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:18,838
Come on. He got Charlie and Dr. Nicolai dead.

654
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,672
<i>That's what he got. </i>

655
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,638
No. No more.

656
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,517
The river's the way out.

657
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,239
Kathryn's right. I'm with her.

658
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,156
Who else is coming?

659
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,958
<i>Alex?</i>

660
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,596
If you ever wanna see the sun again,
you should follow me now.

661
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,317
This is bullshit! We have to stay together!

662
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:55,109
Tyler, look at him. He's not human.

663
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,634
<i>We need you with us. </i>

664
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,631
Tyler?

665
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:03,795
Good luck.

666
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,676
<i>Fine. Let's get in the water. </i>

667
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,595
Tell me we're doing the right thing.

668
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,356
Don't stop believing in him, Ty.

669
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,632
<i>It's getting cold. </i>

670
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,953
Where to?

671
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,469
Down.

672
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,116
<i>You sure?</i>

673
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,673
Yeah, down.

674
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,475
- My lead. Let's go.
- Yeah.

675
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,998
You OK?

676
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:11,629
Yeah, it's solid! Off rope!

677
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,869
Argh!

678
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,231
<i>- Tyler!</i>
- Tyler!

679
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,078
Top, cover!

680
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,188
Shit!

681
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,471
Hold on, Top!

682
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,077
Shit!

683
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,079
Top! Top! You all right?

684
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,116
My leg.

685
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,116
- Can you walk?
- I don't know.

686
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,156
Oh, shit!

687
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,509
<i>Looks like the rebreather</i>
<i>punched a hole through the ice. </i>

688
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,516
Yeah.

689
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,276
Smells like methane.

690
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,068
Some kind of killing ground.

691
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,596
It's just like Nicolai's mosaic legend.

692
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:23,672
That means there's gotta be
an opening close by.

693
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,518
Top! Tyler!

694
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,320
- You see the light?
- Yeah.

695
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,437
There's cold water coming up.
That's the way out of here.

696
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:56,433
- I think you're right.
- It must have been a dry passage.

697
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,039
Jack? Jack?

698
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:07,072
Jack, what's happening? Top?

699
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:10,311
What's going on?

700
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,594
Jack.

701
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,309
You two get out of here.
I'm going back for them.

702
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,994
You're in no condition. Top can barely walk.

703
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,958
- I'm the one that has to go.
- Put your gear on and get in the water.

704
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,508
I'm not getting in the water.
You're not going back.

705
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:33,839
Mac, whoa! Whoa!

706
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,991
He's right.

707
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:45,992
Now, come on, Jack.
You led us here. You were right.

708
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,992
But I'm doing this now. I'm going back for them.

709
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:05,350
This is the way. We walk until it opens up again.

710
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,553
Run. Run!

711
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:55,159
Shit, we got company.
He must have followed us here.

712
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,957
<i>This thing has got to have a weakness. </i>

713
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,793
<i>Everything's got a weakness. </i>
<i>Where is it?</i>

714
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,677
It's moving.

715
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,070
<i>Top!</i>

716
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,469
It took one of the rebreathers.

717
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,351
He's playing with us.

718
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,236
Kathryn!

719
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,673
Briggs!

720
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,515
<i>Help!</i>

721
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,036
- Briggs!
- Help!

722
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:36,509
Briggs!

723
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,999
No, no!

724
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,548
- Come on!
- No!

725
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,834
Come on!

726
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,672
Tyler!

727
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:44,954
Shit!

728
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,157
Help!

729
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,754
<i>Tyler. </i>

730
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,148
Briggs.

731
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:23,198
Kathryn.

732
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:24,679
Where?

733
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,196
Sorry. Go.

734
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,714
<i>- Go. </i>
- No.

735
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:42,949
Briggs!

736
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,757
Shit.

737
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,276
Tyler.

738
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,553
Are you all right? What happened?

739
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,756
- Why did they leave?
- Sound waves.

740
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:33,229
They retreat from the pulse. Doesn't last long.

741
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:37,029
- We found a way out.
- Jack was right.

742
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,554
And the others? Briggs?

743
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,952
No, no. He didn't make it.

744
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,400
- Where's Kim?
- I don't know. We got separated.

745
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,630
Shit!

746
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:52,314
All right, come on. This way.

747
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,278
This is it. You ready?

748
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:16,471
<i>- You can make it. </i>
- Yeah.

749
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,229
All right.

750
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,796
Let's go.

751
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,836
Don't be scared. It's gonna be fine.

752
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,438
Watch your head.

753
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,836
Tyler!

754
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,436
<i>We've gotta go under. </i>

755
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,876
Come on, Kathryn. Breathe.

756
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,756
Are you all right?

757
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,395
- Alex!
- We gotta go. They're coming this way!

758
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:03,192
- Look, I can't go back in the water.
- Come on.

759
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:07,319
The way out's next to an ice vein.
This has to connect to the other one. Let's go.

760
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:21,555
All right.

761
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,956
They gotta be here somewhere.

762
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,957
But where?

763
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,798
Jack, Top.

764
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,836
Quiet.

765
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,876
Kill your light.

766
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,398
Where's Briggs?

767
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,276
They're watching us.

768
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,271
They see with sound.

769
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,828
And the steam, it's confusing them.

770
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:20,151
They took one of our rebreathers,
but they've left us alone since.

771
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:23,391
- They're waiting on something.
- There were more right behind us.

772
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:26,916
We should get in the water now.

773
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,514
Look. This works for a while.

774
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,151
We have to split out the tanks, the air and
oxygen. Won't last long, but it's our only choice.

775
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,596
We need the other rebreather, Tyler.

776
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,872
You see it there?

777
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,111
<i>- Yeah. </i>
<i>- I'm going for it. You get the rest in the water. </i>

778
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,149
OK.

779
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,310
<i>Top, start breaking down that unit. </i>

780
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,914
<i>Kathryn, you and Alex buddy-breathe</i>
<i>from the air tank. </i>

781
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,833
Top, that's gonna leave you with the oxygen.

782
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,876
<i>- No regulator. </i>
- Cool.

783
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:15,949
Jack!

784
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,989
I'll cover you with the mapping gun.

785
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,355
All right, let's go. Let's get out of here.

786
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,034
<i>Let's go! Come on!</i>

787
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:30,596
Alex!

788
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,435
Oh!

789
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,629
<i>Tyler!</i>
- Tyler!

790
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:55,830
Jack!

791
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,676
Tyler, behind us!

792
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:11,636
Tyler!

793
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:26,713
<i>Jack, there's another one!</i>

794
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,712
Jack, no!

795
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,589
Go!

796
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,590
Jack! Get in the water!

797
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,917
Come on, mother...

798
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,149
No!

799
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,589
You gonna be OK, Tyler?
- Yeah.

800
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,870
Take care of yourself, man.

801
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,956
Bye, Kathryn.

802
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:43,353
- Travel safe, OK?
- All right.

803
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:07,516
Tyler?

804
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,795
I'm sorry.

805
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:12,075
You're thinking about him.

806
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,832
Yeah.

807
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,556
You said that parasite was changing him.

808
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:27,553
I mean, he never could have
survived out here, could he?

809
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,152
At first... I thought it could only survive
in a cave environment.

810
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,315
But now I'm not so sure.

811
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,268
I think it wants to get out.

812
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,555
No.

813
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:00,469
Excuse me.

814
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:13,514
Hey!

815
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,315
Nemo
