1
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,848
Have you ever done it with your dad?

2
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,896
You want to know the truth
about teens today.

3
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,971
They tell the future of Japan.

4
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,535
That hopeless future.

5
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,052
Do you do this a lot?

6
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,616
Do what?

7
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,814
This.

8
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,211
Why are you here?

9
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,488
Work.

10
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,730
l told you to stop.
l said stop it!

11
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,528
ls it on?

12
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,054
l can't do this.

13
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,292
Touch me.

14
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,329
Wait.

15
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,339
This is wrong.

16
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,573
You're hard.
No.

17
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,777
Yes you are.

18
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,055
Wanna do it?

19
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,532
50,000 yen to do it. A blow is three.
l play with myself for two.

20
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,495
Video's an extra three.

21
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,612
Five to do it.

22
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,736
This is wrong.
We can't do this.

23
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,097
No fooling around on the job.

24
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:41,937
Hurry up and get undressed.

25
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,574
Take off your clothes.

26
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,610
Stop it, will you?

27
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,050
Don't do that at work!

28
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,095
Are you sure?

29
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,969
Ow!

30
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:52,172
That feels so good!

31
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,534
What's that?

32
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,572
You smell so good.

33
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,059
Let's fuck!

34
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:11,053
This is incredible! lt's too much!

35
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,015
Here l go!

36
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:23,214
That's good.

37
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,978

38
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,416

39
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,449
Ow!

40
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,099
This is no good.

41
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,498
What am l doing?

42
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,898
What am l doing?

43
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,052
You can't tell anyone.

44
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,929
Early bird.

45
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,175
What?

46
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,819
You came too soon!

47
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,172
Does it matter?

48
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,049
Early bird!

49
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,818
Stop saying that!

50
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,571
ls this a hard job?

51
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,692
How much?
- 100,000 yen.

52
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,855
100,000 yen?

53
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,212
Coming early is 100,000.

54
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,852
Have you had many guys?

55
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,010
Just you.

56
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,098
You're lying. Liar!

57
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,492
l only have 70,000 yen.

58
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,459
l don't believe this!

59
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,336
l'll give the rest to your mom.

60
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:16,130
Promise to keep this a secret, ok?
lt's our little secret, promise?

61
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,369
Whatever.

62
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,090
lt's our little secret, okay?

63
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,695
You should stop doing this.

64
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,853
You should study in your spare time.

65
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,017
lt's been on the whole time!

66
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,496
What for?

67
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,530
Early bird!

68
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,729
Stop it!

69
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:57,216
You're all hard. You want
to do it, don't you.

70
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,248
Have you ever been hit on the head?

71
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,294
Have you ever hit your mom?

72
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,056
That's the wrong brush!

73
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:56,937
l told you what brand to get!
Do you want to my gums to bleed!

74
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,611
Don't fuck with me!

75
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,372
Please, not my face!

76
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,774
Bitch!

77
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,613
No Entry

78
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,970
Takuya!

79
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,612
Takuya!

80
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,659
See you tomorrow.

81
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,611
You'd better be at school!

82
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,972
Organic Kale Extract

83
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,331
More.

84
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,969
l want more.

85
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,049
Thanks.

86
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,375
Get with it!

87
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,179
This is my friend.
He'll stay here a while.

88
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,014
Go ahead, don't care about me.

89
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,380
What are you waiting for?

90
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,299
Why are there commercials showing?

91
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,730
l went out. l'm sorry.

92
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,852
l told you to stay at home
and work nearby the TV!

93
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,538
l'm sorry!

94
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,332
Shut up, bitch!

95
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,099
Ow! l had business!

96
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,009
l'm off to bed.

97
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,368
Good night.

98
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,015
l'll do it right next time!

99
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,289
Shut up!

100
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,016
Ow! l'm sorry! Don't hit my face!

101
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,573
Fuck your face!

102
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,691
Don't hit my face!

103
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,014
Not my face!

104
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,653
Good evening, l'm Asako Murata.

105
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,293
l'm Masashi Shimizu.

106
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,376
The newborn raccoon at the zoo
got a new name yesterday.

107
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,252
Her name is Helen.

108
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,570
Could l have some ice?

109
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,055
lsn't she cute!

110
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,448
Just a little.

111
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,778
There has been a fierce discussion
between ruling party members...

112
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,337
following the Prime Minister's
off-color remarks...

113
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,098
at a reception yesterday.

114
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,573
Take off your pants.

115
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,457
What?

116
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,535
Want to do it?

117
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,093
What? ls there something wrong?

118
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,374
Not tonight. l'm not feeling well.

119
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,009
l don't feel good.

120
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,848
You forgot something.

121
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,339
You're so neat!

122
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,534
l'm impressed.

123
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,575
Stop it!

124
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,733
Come here.

125
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:02,939
There's a girl's room downstairs.
Whose is it?

126
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:10,538
My big sister's. She left,
but her room is still there.

127
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,775
Really.

128
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,933
Don't look like that.

129
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,413
Excuse me.

130
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,252
l'm doing a report about
young people today.

131
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,256
Say what?

132
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,896
Hey, are you putting this on tape?

133
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,499
Stop recording immediately!

134
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:38,935
Didn't you get it?
No more recording!

135
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,053
What the fuck...?

136
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,579
Howl, bitch! Let me hear you howl!

137
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:13,256
You look good, old fart!
Pretty good!

138
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,533
''l'm interviewing people.''
Sounds good.

139
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,169
l'm done.

140
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,135
See you later.

141
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,894
Perfect.

142
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,049
Have a nice day.

143
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,608
l'm off.

144
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,895
Welcome.

145
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,049
Good morning.

146
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,376
Thanks for coming.

147
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,728
What happened?

148
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,891
l don't know. l got hit twice.

149
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,056
Maybe some of those
young punks again.

150
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,500
May l take your order?

151
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,814
Coffee please.

152
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:07,491
What's up? We agreed not
to meet for a while, right?

153
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,653
l've got an idea that's
guaranteed to boost ratings.

154
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,451
Another one?

155
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:18,017
This one's for real.
A bullied son and his father.

156
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,459
That's nothing new.

157
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,456
That's not all.

158
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,378
Don't you remember the scandal?

159
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,168
You need to get away from work.

160
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:33,693
You even showed that video.
Remember what a fool it made of you?

161
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:46,694
This time l'm covering my son.
l'm the father.

162
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,009
What?

163
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,931
lt can't get any truer than this.
l mean, this is the real thing.

164
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:59,250
Here's the title.
l'm going to call it ''True Bullying''.

165
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,770
l thought it was strange.

166
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:19,137
A nice lady like you turning tricks.

167
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:33,217
You know, it's different
with someone who limps.

168
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,533
ls that so?

169
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,939
They feel different inside.
You know what l mean?

170
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,008
lt's difficult to explain.

171
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:53,258
l wonder what yours looks like.
l didn't get a good view at it before.

172
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,731
Beer?
- No, thanks.

173
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,338
Who did this to you?

174
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,571
What is all this? Does it hurt?

175
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,298
lt looks really bad.

176
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:23,377
You should go to the police.
l mean, a woman like you...

177
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,450
Does he beat you if
earnings are down?

178
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,809
How much is it?

179
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,491
30,000 yen would be enough, right?

180
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:08,174
Could you whip me with this one?

181
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:27,138
lt's fine. Hit me again.

182
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,698
That's good.

183
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,934
More. Go on please, whip
me as hard as you like.

184
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:57,289
Welcome back.

185
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,609
l'm home.

186
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,212
What do you want?

187
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,493
Why don't you...

188
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,458
take a little rest here?

189
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:06,217
How did you make me do that?

190
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,610
lt's amazing!

191
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,409
This is so good.

192
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:46,419
lt's so crispy, so crunchy.

193
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,850
Just look at this.
Look at the juice.

194
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,739
lt's out of this world.

195
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,449
l want some more.

196
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,855
Okay.

197
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,290
And this is great too.

198
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,093
Here you go.

199
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,574
What is all this?

200
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,492
Someone's birthday?

201
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,213
No.

202
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,534
Bitch!

203
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,050
Ow! That was hot!

204
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,095

205
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,132
Come out!

206
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,299
Takuya!

207
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,576
They're here!

208
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,495
Everyone, can you see this?

209
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:22,171
Can you see this?
Everyone, this is my home! My home!

210
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,770
Did you see that?
The big strong bullies are here!

211
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:29,290
This is my wife!
She's a lovely little wife!

212
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,571
Dinner was delicious!

213
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,533
This is... l don't know who this is!
We're not acquainted!

214
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:35,975
This is my home!

215
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:40,378
Watch! lt's amazing, truly amazing!

216
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:44,459
What a scene!
My wife threw this knife!

217
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:52,931
This is it! How should l feel?
l don't know how a father should feel!

218
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:57,099
But l know my family is
being destroyed!

219
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:02,897
So what do you think? How do we
judge this wonderful bullying?

220
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:07,576
l'm burning! l just saw fireworks
in my head! lt's hot, so hot!

221
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:43,699
What's taking you so long?
Hurry up and shit!

222
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:53,218
Take a shit, you little turd!
-l don't want to!

223
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,410
Think you have a choice?

224
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,728
Dump it!

225
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:13,249
Hurry up and shit!
Answer me when l speak to you, fucker!

226
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,898
What are you doing?

227
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,209
You're filthy!

228
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:26,377
This is nothing.
They're just beating him up.

229
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,058
Don't you mind getting hurt?

230
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:32,810
lf that happens, l want you to go in.
That'll be the main story.

231
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:36,489
You're the brave girl reporter
entering the spotlight.

232
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,609
Here's the plan.

233
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,809
You better listen, too!

234
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,738
Zoom in on Takuya if he's in danger.

235
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,930
Then zoom out, slowly.

236
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:49,657
l want a close-up of her expression.
Can you look really determined?

237
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:54,456
Then l open the door slowly,
and start walking over powerfully.

238
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:59,415
l'll stare at them the whole time.
l'll yell ''Stop!'' as hard as l can.

239
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,258
This is stupid!
- What's up?

240
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:02,699
You can't use it.

241
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:04,014
Why not?

242
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,814
Think about what you're taping.

243
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,771
Stop it! Who the hell are you?

244
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,379
He asked me to come.

245
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,894
What's wrong with you?

246
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,571
l'm fed up with this.
- What?!

247
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:21,969
l don't love you.
l just feel sorry for you.

248
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:26,177
l can't stand you any longer.

249
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:31,812
l thougt you liked my idea!
What happened?

250
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:35,012
l want to go home.
Let go of me!

251
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,299
Hey, wait!

252
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,814
Who do you think you are?
Bitch!

253
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:06,578
Stop it!

254
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:11,296
lt's because l come too early!
Just because l come too early. Bitch!

255
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:16,533
That's why l'm full of hot air.
lt's very simple.

256
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:22,696
You like it that much?
You like them to last, huh?

257
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:26,775
ls extensive sex really that good?
Huh?!

258
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:31,532
l'll give you an extensive screw!
Come on, hold still!

259
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,215
Take off your clothes!
Now!

260
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:46,169
Fuck you, bitch!
Don't you fuck with me!

261
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:53,096
Always laughing at everyone!
Look, this one will last long enough!

262
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:58,610
Come on, get your clothes off!

263
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:10,852
Okay, now you will come!
l'm screwing you, long and hard!

264
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:17,095
Come on, pant! Pant, bitch, pant!

265
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:23,134
l want to hear you moan!
Moan like if you're enjoying it!

266
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,251
Let's do it long and hard!

267
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,130
l'll do it long. Long and hard!

268
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,811
What happened? Come on, make a noise!

269
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:45,218
Make a sound, do it!

270
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,818
We got a lot of things to do.

271
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,608
Follow me. Let's go!

272
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:41,815
Ready? We'll chop her in small pieces
and put them in a plastic bag.

273
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:44,738
Keep taping until we throw
her into the garbage.

274
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:47,574
Get a bin liner! Hurry up!

275
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:59,257
You can see it, can't you?
We can't have that.

276
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:04,974
Bin liners?

277
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,329
Here you are.

278
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:40,849
Wait a second. Look, l learned
how to squeeze them myself.

279
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:45,294
l realized something
when you were holding me.

280
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:53,976
l'm not special or pathetic.
l'm just an ordinary woman.

281
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:59,294
Look,see how they're squirting?

282
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:03,419
Do you see it?
Look how much comes out!

283
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,372
See how they're squirting?

284
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:27,570
We'll make a straight cut
from the shoulder.

285
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:33,298
Then scoop out the breasts.

286
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:39,456
The nipples, too.

287
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:48,169
We'll draw on her arms here,
and cut them at the wrists.

288
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:52,929
Her legs will come next.

289
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:03,218
Let's cut them off right about here.

290
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:34,974
Beautiful.

291
01:02:56,140 --> 01:03:01,533
l've been covering how
my son gets beaten up.

292
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:08,129
This has allowed me to explore
my feelings as a father.

293
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:13,739
l never knew how
l really felt inside.

294
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:16,898
But now l finally understand.

295
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:23,011
lt was neither anger nor sadness.

296
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:28,736
l felt it right here, and l
wanted to have sex.

297
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:34,615
Some things are truly strange.

298
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:42,731
Come on, let's do it.
l don't care if you're a corpse.

299
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,773
Corpses are good enough for me.
Let's do it extensively and hard!

300
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,215
Here l come. Are you ready?

301
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:07,015
Don't be nervous.
l haven't felt like this in ages.

302
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:20,498
l'm nervous, too.
Shit, l can't undo my buttons!

303
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:03,609
This is good, really good.
l like how you've gotten all tight.

304
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:12,773
Everyone, what do you think now?

305
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:18,133
Here's a father
whose son gets beaten up.

306
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:26,500
Here is a real father whose son gets
beaten up. lsn't it wonderful?

307
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:32,332
What do you think?
This feels so good!

308
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:39,330
l'm going to come early again!
That's no good!

309
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:42,610
l can do it, l can do it!
Just watch me do it!

310
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:57,938

Here l go!

311
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:13,136
Yes, you're wet! You got wet!
You're dead, but you're all wet!

312
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:19,210
The mysteries of life are amazing!
Even a corpse can get wet!

313
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:22,175
This is amazing! Amazing!

314
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,170
Hey, this is shit!

315
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:31,738
lt's not a mystery of life,
it's shit!

316
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:34,693
What the fuck did you eat?

317
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:37,050
You stink!
God, do you stink, bitch!

318
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:41,893
You wanna do this? God, do you stink!

319
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:32,529
You're dead, and you still
want to fuck with me.

320
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:34,093
Do you want to shit on me, bitch?

321
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:39,569
Ow! What the hell...?

322
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:45,572
Why'd you get so tight?

323
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:52,658
ls it rigor mortis? This is no good.

324
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:01,218
l can't pull him out! What the hell...
Oh, fuck!

325
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:04,492
What the fuck do l do?

326
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,579
Hey, Keiko!

327
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:23,129

328
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:28,169
Keiko! Help!

329
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:34,173
Help me, Keiko!

330
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:04,496
Vinegar

331
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:19,568
Keiko! Help!

332
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:32,093
Are you sure this will really help?

333
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:34,290
They say it softens your body.

334
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,650
Wouldn't warm oil be more effective?

335
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:39,897
At least it would be easier
to clean up afterwards.

336
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:43,569
Ow, it hurts!
Keiko, please do something!

337
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:47,457
l don't have a choice, do l?
Wait a second.

338
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,978
Excuse me.

339
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:57,813
What's up with her? She hasn't been
that resolute since we got married!

340
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:01,810
You don't understand a thing.

341
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:03,089
Understand what?

342
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:06,660
Ow! She's even getting smaller!

343
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:13,775
Give me your arm.

344
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:16,334
What for?
- Just give me your arm.

345
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:19,458
Stick out your thumb. Hold on tight.

346
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:21,333
What's in the syringe?

347
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:23,619
Don't worry.

348
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:25,369
Ow!

349
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:35,738
Perfect!

350
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:43,774
l got out.

351
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:50,254
There... Aren't you happy now?

352
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:57,892
Rolling!

353
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:08,499
This is my wife Keiko.

354
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:12,619
Okay, let's put her down here.

355
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:24,613
She's getting stiffer and stiffer.

356
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:26,298
Keep filming! Get this part.

357
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:31,052
She's beautiful. This is really good.
She's so stiff.

358
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:37,653
What's wrong? Do you want a leg?
Do you like this part more?

359
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:40,817
No. She smells.

360
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:46,173
She smells?
You're right, she's started to stink!

361
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:52,212
You promised to bring it today!

362
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,810
Wait!
Why are you running away?

363
01:11:57,260 --> 01:11:59,330
Just look at yourself!

364
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:01,129
They're here... They're here!

365
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,899
They're all here! Do your best!
ls the battery charged?

366
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:06,814
Okay, come on!

367
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:13,498
Here we go!

368
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:17,134
One more!

369
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:27,212
lt's just like a big party!

370
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:55,178
''This product contains no fragrance.''
This deodorizer doesn't smell.

371
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:56,858
Not bad, and it's only silica gel.

372
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:59,938
Sounds too good to be true.

373
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,129
That's enough. Let's go inside.

374
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:07,896
Look at him!
He's all yellow, he's beautiful!

375
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,619
We can't take care of them all at once.

376
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:21,898
We'll work steady, one by one.

377
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:28,898
l marked her. Slice her
wrists, then chop off this joint.

378
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,533
Then take the bone inside...
Slice the skin...

379
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:56,975
What's wrong?

380
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:11,417
From today on, l'm going to study.

381
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:17,056
l have to pass some entrance
examinations next year.

382
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:19,095
ls that so?

383
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:27,768
Tell me why you really
came to our place.

384
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:33,611
You came to destroy it, didn't you?

385
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:40,898
That's what l thought all the time.

386
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:52,535
Thank you.

387
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,931
Her belly's softer than her head.

388
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:20,175
Of course it is!

389
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,411
She's squirting just like you!

390
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,091
Would you look at that!

391
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:31,019
Her entrails start appearing.

392
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:33,732
They're beautiful.

393
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:37,290
The white parts are so white...

394
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:40,849
She's resolving!

395
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:44,979
Are you okay?

396
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,570
l'm fine.
l'll wash it for you afterwards.

397
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:07,169
Hey!

398
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,128
Want to have sex?

399
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:28,891
You get a special discount
for being good-looking.

400
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:32,609
A screw costs 30,000 yen;
a blow job 20,000. What do you say?

401
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:37,495
l need money.

402
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:47,618
The sea's so endless
You can't see anything.

403
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:55,215
The waves build up slowly,
then they start to break.

404
01:20:55,820 --> 01:21:01,895
There are tiny bubbles everywhere.

405
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:08,695
They're born, sparkling
and shinig in the sun.

406
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:27,216
They move around slowly,
they're floating and sinking.

407
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:34,212
They kiss and become one
and then they float apart.

408
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:40,895
They slowly grow, then they burst...

409
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:47,809
and sink back into the sea.
