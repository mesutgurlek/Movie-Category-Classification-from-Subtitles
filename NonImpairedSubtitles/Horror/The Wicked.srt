00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:06,263
Hey, you're supposed to be asleep. What's
the matter? / The wicked is gonna get me.

3
00:01:06,764 --> 00:01:12,520
The wicked? / She's out there.
She eats children to stay young.

4
00:01:13,354 --> 00:01:18,067
I think the older kid has been
teasing you, sweety. / I broke her window.

5
00:01:19,027 --> 00:01:21,612
Her window?

6
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:26,033
If you threw a rock at the house, and break
one of her window, the wicked will get you.

7
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:32,540
So, you and Jenny went out with the older kids?
You were supposed to stay at her house.

8
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:37,378
It was just for a bit. Her sister had
a car and we drove.

9
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:42,341
And I didn't know it that far.
I'm sorry, Mommy.

10
00:01:42,842 --> 00:01:48,056
Well, I remembered a story of the wicked
from when I was a little girl.

11
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:54,812
And I can tell you, we searched and searched
that old house in the woods...

12
00:01:58,858 --> 00:02:01,945
And it was never a witch to be found.

13
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:05,657
It was just a silly story
to frighten little kids.

14
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:08,993
Here.

15
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:15,749
Now, I have to go concentrate on work.
I have a big case tomorrow.

16
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,046
So you, go to sleep.

17
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:20,398
Mommy, help me!
Mommy!

18
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,076
Mommy! /
Amanda, that's enough.

19
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:47,132
Amanda?

20
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:49,635
Amanda?

21
00:03:50,136 --> 00:03:52,305
Amanda!

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,182

WICKED JUST A MYTH?

37
00:07:47,706 --> 00:07:51,084
I wanna thank you all for coming.
I know my dad would really appreciate.

38
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:55,965
Quite a character, rather than miss him.
Especially his grandson.

39
00:07:58,175 --> 00:08:04,181
You believe or not, I think you all are gonna miss
his magic. I've always been a victim from time to time.

40
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:11,397
Before he died, he said something that I think
he wanted me to pass on.

41
00:08:12,648 --> 00:08:15,859
"God is the greatest magician of all."

42
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:23,450
"Family, friend, and the love that bind
some of us most in need. That lasts forever."

43
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,707
"That's not an illusion."

44
00:08:37,798 --> 00:08:44,346
Told you what, man. When I go, I wanna be cremated.
Of course, no way I'm gonna stuck in the box.

45
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:46,847
What's the diffrence if you dead?

46
00:08:47,847 --> 00:08:51,228
I'm just saying, I don't wanna bugs and shit
crawling over me chewing on my flesh.

47
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:53,939
Hey, guys.

48
00:09:00,362 --> 00:09:03,782
That's cute. Hey, hello? Guys!
Excuse me.

49
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:08,828
Hey, Zack. What's going on? /
Well, my grandpa just died.

50
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:13,917
He was old, wasn't he? / Nice. /
Yeah. Sucks to get old I guess.

51
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:18,921
But we're still going tomorrow night, right? /
My dad has to work at hospital all night.

52
00:09:18,922 --> 00:09:22,300
And? / I mean he has to babysit
his retarded brother.

53
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:24,806
Dad's freaked out about that girl
dragged aside from a window..

54
00:09:24,807 --> 00:09:27,706
He thinks there's some child murders
creeping the neighborhood or something.

55
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:31,977
We go anyway. / Come on man, you know
my little brother. He's a dick in hotel.

56
00:09:32,478 --> 00:09:33,650
If I got caught drinking or anything else,

57
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:38,950
..dad's not gonna pay for school.
I'll never get outta here. 

58
00:09:58,796 --> 00:10:02,424
Thanks for coming. Keep your food then
in kitchen, that'll be great.

59
00:10:21,485 --> 00:10:27,699
How are you doing, kiddo? /
It's delusion, isn't it?

60
00:10:29,034 --> 00:10:34,331
There's no up there. It makes you feel
better when someone died.

61
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:42,839
I don't know. I mean there's no
fluffy clouds or winged angels.

62
00:10:44,758 --> 00:10:50,889
I think we go somewhere. I think
we go somewhere that not so far away...

63
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,685
...that we still a part of those
who still here.

64
00:10:56,853 --> 00:10:59,606
Come on. Grab something
you can believe in.

65
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:06,530
You'll be okay.

66
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:11,034
Yeah..

67
00:11:28,802 --> 00:11:30,971
Abra cadabra, Grandpa.

68
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:36,261
Oh, did you ever find out who
ratted  you out at the McDowel's party?

69
00:11:36,307 --> 00:11:39,061
 Who else? Deputy dickhead Carl.

70
00:11:39,062 --> 00:11:43,858
Yeah. But you know the new girl, Julie? /
Oh yeah. / Yeah, who doesn't?

71
00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:45,852
Dude, Jake was calling, said she
got kicked out of her old school...

72
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:47,862
..'cause she had sex with 
her English teacher.

73
00:11:47,863 --> 00:11:50,781
Oh yeah? I heard she was, uh..
doing coke in the bathroom.

74
00:11:50,782 --> 00:11:56,229
Oh, whatever. Apparently she has noticed
you hot stuff, and she wants to come.

75
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,001
Where's that? / Open Hearth. She needs a big
strong guy like to keep her safe. / Open Hearth?

76
00:12:02,502 --> 00:12:07,298
Really? / Dude, what it is, works it out./
You're not scared, are you?

77
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,135
Yeah, he is.

78
00:12:13,972 --> 00:12:18,225
What the fuck! What are you doing,
shitbrain? / Trimming the hedges, screw you!

79
00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:20,436
Hey, why don't you find your boy friend, then? /
He's not my boyfriend.

80
00:12:20,937 --> 00:12:26,401
She's a dyke, remember? / You know, Tracy,
do you spoke your mind, you'd be speechless.

81
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,157
Give me, give me that. How long you've been, uh..
trimming the hedges? / I didn't hear anything.

82
00:12:33,658 --> 00:12:38,580
Yeah? I'll give you third eye
If I ever found out what you did. Got it?

83
00:12:44,628 --> 00:12:46,755
Come on, man. Let her go, dude.

84
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:59,350

88
00:13:32,926 --> 00:13:36,805
My grandpa's.
Gave me all his magic stuff.

89
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:41,601
What's this? /
A witch bottle. / A what?

90
00:13:42,644 --> 00:13:47,022
It's supposed to ward off the witch's spell.
Careful with it. It's fragile.

91
00:13:47,023 --> 00:13:50,068
Do you have any asshole bottles?
Might work on your brother.

92
00:13:51,528 --> 00:13:55,364
Idiot! /
I'm sorry seriously.

93
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:08,753
Hey, wanna make a fun prank call? /
Fun when we were like what? 10? Grow up!

94
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:16,720
Look, I was forced to grow out when I was about 6.
So, I'm gonna be a kid for as long as I can, all right?

95
00:14:20,265 --> 00:14:23,476
Any plans tomorrow night? /

Pretty worth of it, it's all on Facebook. Okay?

146
00:20:37,892 --> 00:20:41,520
I wish it was you that died! /
Likewise.

147
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,525
Likewise.

148
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:06,962
Where'd you up to? /
Just coming home frome my shrink.

149
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:13,010
She said you can be a real asshole sometimes. /
A shrink said that? / Yup.

150
00:21:14,178 --> 00:21:16,513
She's right.

151
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:20,559
It doesn't matter.
We have plans tonight.

152
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:25,814
Take your camera. I wanna blackmail
his ass. / Excellent.

153
00:21:26,315 --> 00:21:29,229
My mom's been drunk since this morning.
So she won't even know.

154
00:21:29,315 --> 00:21:31,529
We'll grab some sleeping bags. We camp.

155
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:35,658
Unless you're scared ./
Scared of what?

156
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,458
Hey, Samantha, how is it going? /
Hey, Carl.

157
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:48,003
Come here.

158
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:55,845
Roy Harlan said he saw you swiped a cigarette from
his shop yesterday. / It wasn't me. I don't smoke.

159
00:21:56,971 --> 00:22:00,181
Other kids just got it somehow, right? /
Leave her alone.

160
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:02,810
Shut your smelly dickhole!

161
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:11,443
Your mother's a drunk. And nobody knows who
your father is. You know what that means, right?

162
00:22:11,944 --> 00:22:13,366
It means when I finally nail your ass,

163
00:22:13,444 --> 00:22:17,866
..they're gonna ship  you out to a foster home
just as far away from here as they can.

164
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:22,246
We haven't forgotten about all those
prank phone calls, shitsmirk.

165
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:26,249
Paybacks are coming.
Trust me.

166
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:32,548
You consider mouthwash, Carl? I don't know
what smells worse, your breath or your ass.

167
00:22:37,303 --> 00:22:39,972
I'm sorry about your grandpa.
I liked him.

168
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,018
He didn't like you.

169
00:22:45,853 --> 00:22:51,233
I got a picture you're smoking dope while on duty.
That'll got you fired you know.

170
00:22:51,734 --> 00:22:54,528
That's bullshit. /
Isn't.

171
00:23:01,744 --> 00:23:06,373
See you around, fuckers. /
Mahoney! Button up your shirt.

172
00:23:06,874 --> 00:23:10,753
God, he's so weird. /
Let's get outta here.

173
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:16,926
Damn, nice house.

174
00:23:20,763 --> 00:23:23,349
You thought I was kidding? /
Crazy.

175
00:23:24,475 --> 00:23:26,685
Sweet.

176
00:23:27,478 --> 00:23:33,191
I mean this just.. just like Bruce Wayne mansion. /
For real. Hopefully she shows us the "bat cave".

177
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:35,945
Really?
Grow up.

178
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:46,080
She's gorgeous and loaded.

179
00:23:54,296 --> 00:23:59,426
Lucky ass. / Hey, how are you? / Good./
It's good to see you.

180
00:24:00,636 --> 00:24:05,348
Zack, you know Julie, right? /
Uh, we're in trigon.

181
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:08,018
Are we?

182
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:12,147
I should tell you.

183
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:18,111
Hey, what's up? /
Thanks for inviting me.

184
00:24:18,612 --> 00:24:21,323
Yeah, anything, just sure then.

185
00:24:21,824 --> 00:24:26,119
Dude, her eyes are green. All right.
Come on, we gotta sort shit up./ Whatever.

186
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,752
Hey, hey, wanna switch girlfriend? /
I told you. / Come on.

187
00:24:35,295 --> 00:24:37,255
Well, speak of the devil.

188
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:43,178
So, what's this "Open Hearth" thing anyway? /
Oh, it's the name of the witch's house.

189
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,034
Witch? / Yeah, it's used to be
thruth and dare.

190
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:49,434
The trick was you had to get close enough
to throw a rock at the house.

191
00:24:49,935 --> 00:24:53,688
If you hit the house without breaking
any windows, then you would safe.

192
00:24:54,189 --> 00:24:57,275
And if you break a window? /
Then the wicked will get you.

193
00:24:57,776 --> 00:25:00,820
It's just bullshit, right?

194
00:25:01,321 --> 00:25:04,868
You know legend has it, that the witch and her cavern
were burnt by with hunter back in the day...

195
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:06,868
..like, you know, a hundred years ago
or something.

196
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:11,373
Ladine Lorene. / Yeah, that's right.
Ladine Lorine. She survived.

197
00:25:11,874 --> 00:25:14,585
You wanna know how? /
Yeah.

198
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:22,008
She eats kids. Yeah, she eats kids.
She tears the limbs off.

199
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:28,764
One by one. She start with their feet. And then
she rips off their legs. And she rips off their arms.

200
00:25:28,765 --> 00:25:33,769
And she eats every part of the body. And she
eats the little ones, you know, to keep her young.

201
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:40,277
She eats the older ones to keep her strong.
Then she eats the pretty ones, just like you...

202
00:25:41,236 --> 00:25:44,197
..to keep her beautiful. /
That's ridiculous.

203
00:25:44,698 --> 00:25:50,244
"Season of the equinox the witch.." uh.. /
"Besets her kill." /

204
00:25:50,245 --> 00:25:54,207
Terima kasih. /
"One less soul the town to know"..

205
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:58,002
.."taken against their will". /
Nice!

206
00:25:58,503 --> 00:26:00,755
It is time. Let's go.

207
00:26:01,256 --> 00:26:05,468
But, why doesn't it feel like a tradition?
I mean, why we're the only ones doing it?

208
00:26:05,469 --> 00:26:09,847
Well, apparently 15 years ago some kid
broke her window, and was never heard from again.

209
00:26:09,848 --> 00:26:14,644
Yeah, except he ran away to Florida or something. /
Dude, that's just what the cops want people to believe.

210
00:26:14,645 --> 00:26:16,966
Okay? What about those kids
who were hiking from long way?

211
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,566
What, 4 years ago? Right?
No one found them.

212
00:26:20,067 --> 00:26:25,738
Yeah, well. They did searched the entire house.
It was abandoned. So.. / That's all part of her magic.

213
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:27,494
Come on, man. Do you really believe that?

214
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:31,994
Listen, all I'm saying is, there is a reason
that we should stop doing this.

215
00:26:31,995 --> 00:26:35,165
Whatever. Let's go.

216
00:26:41,463 --> 00:26:43,548
Road trip!

217
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:49,845
Hey, what are you doing? / Taking a picture. I'm just
gonna put it on Facebook. / Are you retarded?

218
00:26:49,846 --> 00:26:54,935
I'm not supposed to be up here! / Stop it, okay?
Don't post anything. I have a class to show up.

219
00:26:56,728 --> 00:27:01,024
Oh, this is so freaking sad.
She's just like my little sister.

220
00:27:01,525 --> 00:27:06,988
I heard that she ran up with a bunch of kid,
and someone hit the window.

221
00:27:07,781 --> 00:27:10,658
You're freaking me out. / The cops went
to checked it out, it was empty.

222
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:13,532
Oh, don't listen to him. That house
has freaking awsome mirrors.

223
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:17,332
Oh my God, the creepiest thing, whenever
we tried to get back, those windows are fixed.

224
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:21,460
Have you ever done it? /
Oh, yeah. We were 12.

225
00:27:21,461 --> 00:27:24,172
Zack backed out. /
I had excuses!

226
00:27:24,673 --> 00:27:30,720
Holy shit. I forgot that one. Show her your hand.
Come on, don't be embarrassed about. Just show her.

227
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:32,931
I wanna see it.

228
00:27:36,685 --> 00:27:42,941
Why is that? / Well, my grandpa crashing
the bowling ball trying to do some magic trick.

229
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:46,319
I became his favorite prop all over the show.

230
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,823
Great grandfather. /
Yeah. Right.

231
00:27:59,249 --> 00:28:01,543
Sammy?

232
00:28:02,878 --> 00:28:05,714
Sammy!
Sammy!

233
00:28:15,557 --> 00:28:18,225
How much further? /
I think it's just ahead of us.

234
00:28:18,226 --> 00:28:20,353
You mean we're lost? /
We're not lost.

235
00:28:20,854 --> 00:28:27,610
We're in the middle of nowhere. /
You scared, aren't you? Come on.

236
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:05,106
<i>Come on. / You wanna race? /
Come on.</i>

237
00:29:16,993 --> 00:29:19,788
Speeder Point.
Here it is.

238
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:34,927
What do you think? / There is no
road from here to Open Hearth. So...

239
00:29:35,428 --> 00:29:39,640
Let's hike. It's just a few miles, right? /
You wanna hike tonight?

240
00:29:39,641 --> 00:29:45,605
Yeah, what are you, nervous? / No. I just
got the things in the dark I'd rather do.

241
00:29:46,564 --> 00:29:49,818
Oh, man. Check this out. Wow. /
Beautiful.

242
00:29:51,945 --> 00:29:55,990
I have probation. Probation. /
Are you sure? / Yeah.

243
00:29:55,991 --> 00:29:59,118
I think that's cool. /
What's cool?

244
00:29:59,619 --> 00:30:06,834
I like a guy who doesn't fall for peer pressure.
Just character. Or, you're being a total score.

245
00:30:06,835 --> 00:30:10,046
Come on. /
Try some.

246
00:30:15,343 --> 00:30:18,263
Ladies. /
Don't run away.

247
00:30:21,684 --> 00:30:25,770
So, what's up?  / So, are you
gonna sleep in the same tent?

248
00:30:27,313 --> 00:30:31,359
You're telling secrets already? /
Oh, my God.

249
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,070
Okay, watch.

250
00:30:54,632 --> 00:30:56,968
That was good.

251
00:30:57,469 --> 00:31:02,639
Yeah, my grandpa was great at it. Everybody
was given out silver dires in Christmas.

252
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,310
You still have one. / Yeah.

253
00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:09,355
He was really cool.

254
00:31:11,733 --> 00:31:16,571
Do you really think there is anything
after we die? / It has to be.

255
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:25,788
You don't? / Biological.
It's like.. everything else.

256
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:31,002
And when we die... we just..

257
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:36,841
..just vapor. Energy.
Just like this flame.

258
00:31:41,095 --> 00:31:45,099
And do you think trees are gonna have it? /
Only if they're good.

259
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,645
Otherwise, they're right to the chipper.

260
00:32:16,756 --> 00:32:19,008
I'm sorry.

261
00:32:22,428 --> 00:32:25,598
I thought you were lesbian. /
Shut up.

262
00:32:32,772 --> 00:32:36,484
Have you ever done it? /
Done it, done it?

263
00:32:36,985 --> 00:32:40,989
No. Have you? /
No.

264
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,084
Just the pine cone, all right?

265
00:32:54,252 --> 00:32:56,796
You're scared of everything, aren't you?

266
00:33:29,662 --> 00:33:34,000
Aren't we supposed to be friends? /
So?

267
00:33:36,294 --> 00:33:40,923
I just don't wanna go all the way, for now.

268
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,387
Okay.

269
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:51,517
For now.

270
00:34:04,864 --> 00:34:07,533
I'm not a lesbian.

271
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:15,666
You're kidding.

272
00:34:22,882 --> 00:34:25,259
Open Hearth.

273
00:34:31,474 --> 00:34:33,601
Did you hear that? /
Hear what?

274
00:34:37,563 --> 00:34:42,610
That's what I mean. Quiet.
All the bugs.

275
00:34:48,032 --> 00:34:50,326
All right. Let's get this over with.

276
00:34:54,747 --> 00:34:57,916
I wanna go back. /
Oh, someone's scared.

277
00:34:57,917 --> 00:35:00,127
I'm fucking scared shitless.

278
00:35:02,046 --> 00:35:04,297
I don't.. / Just take it. /
I don't want it.

279
00:35:04,298 --> 00:35:07,259
Come on, Tracy. We're all on this together. /
I don't want to.

280
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:13,557
You did not drive me here for nothing, did you? /
Yes. / Okay, ready? / Count it down. / Okay.

281
00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:16,919
One, two, three!

282
00:35:20,398 --> 00:35:22,608
Oh, shit!

283
00:35:24,193 --> 00:35:27,238
Whose rock is that? /
We'll know soon enough.

284
00:35:29,824 --> 00:35:32,326
There's nothing to worry about.

285
00:35:34,537 --> 00:35:39,166
What? What the fuck! /
Guys! Guys!

286
00:35:40,668 --> 00:35:47,132
Guys, it was just the shadow of a tree.
Yes, it was. / Dude, I was pissed my pants.

287
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:56,559
Jesus! Can we just go? / I think we probably
should. I think you're the one who broke the window.

288
00:35:57,476 --> 00:35:59,687
Damn it, you're a dick, Carter!

289
00:36:00,771 --> 00:36:05,318
We got a LOL. Ready? /
Yeah.

290
00:36:07,862 --> 00:36:10,781
Okay. Here we go.

291
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:31,218
We're getting closer. /
Why do you say that?

292
00:36:35,848 --> 00:36:43,063
Do you think anyone actually died there?  /
That's witch's stake. They burned her there.

293
00:37:07,088 --> 00:37:10,091
Oh my God. They're gonna hear us.

294
00:37:12,676 --> 00:37:14,970
Good.

295
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:20,726
Well, it must've been hard moving so far
before graduation. / Yeah, that is a thought.

296
00:37:22,228 --> 00:37:25,564
Well, you could improve those here.

297
00:37:31,195 --> 00:37:36,742
So, hey. Why did you get kicked out of school?
And you don't have to answer that.

298
00:37:37,243 --> 00:37:41,622
So you heard all those rumors. /
Some of them, yes.

299
00:37:46,293 --> 00:37:48,629
You wanna know what my big secret is?

300
00:37:49,588 --> 00:37:52,303
Because nobody knowing out what happened.

301
00:37:52,388 --> 00:37:56,303
But you have to promise to keep it
between us. 'Cause it's kinda embarrassing.

302
00:37:56,804 --> 00:38:01,600
Okay. /
My big secret is...

303
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:05,187
..that I don't have one.

304
00:38:05,688 --> 00:38:07,276
I would, I just moved. I mean...

305
00:38:07,388 --> 00:38:11,276
the same thing that happened since 8th grade
when my dad got reassigning./ Seriously?

306
00:38:11,777 --> 00:38:13,558
Of course. You didn't sleep
with your English teacher?

307
00:38:13,577 --> 00:38:18,158
And I don't do coke, and then punch
my friend in the face.

308
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:23,413
I can't even remember the other one. /
Wow, how boring.

309
00:38:23,914 --> 00:38:29,295
It is, isn't it? But, life is cute, isn't it,
'cause you joined the cold status.

310
00:38:36,844 --> 00:38:44,393
<i>Yeaah! Oh God! Oh God! </i> /
Oh God...

311
00:38:45,644 --> 00:38:49,857
That's my boy.  /
It's fun to have it.

312
00:38:52,609 --> 00:38:56,989
Don't do that. / You're gonna go in.
You're gonna go in. / Oh yeah?

313
00:39:04,663 --> 00:39:07,166
Did you hear that? /
What?

314
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:10,544
You didn't hear that?

315
00:39:13,422 --> 00:39:15,716
It's just umm...

316
00:39:17,426 --> 00:39:19,553
It's something else.

317
00:39:25,142 --> 00:39:27,311
It's just the wind .

318
00:39:38,989 --> 00:39:41,200
That's not the witch, Zack.

319
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:52,461
Do you wanna go swimming?

320
00:39:55,798 --> 00:39:58,675
I didn't bring a suite. So...

321
00:40:10,562 --> 00:40:16,693
I mean, unless you really think you melt.

322
00:40:40,592 --> 00:40:43,637
Julie? Julie!

323
00:40:54,606 --> 00:41:01,321
Did I scare you? / Not cool. / I thought
it's pretty funny. / No, it's not.

324
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:20,048
Of course not, if we die.

325
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,555
It's close, right? /
Not as scary as everyone says.

326
00:41:42,321 --> 00:41:44,615
I think they're here.

327
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:54,666
You're gonna do it? To hit the window? /
 That's the point.

328
00:41:55,709 --> 00:42:00,172
Beside, how cool it be
to see a witch.

329
00:42:04,635 --> 00:42:06,803
You do it.

330
00:42:19,608 --> 00:42:21,735
Crap.

331
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:27,824
See?

332
00:42:29,117 --> 00:42:31,411
Total gip.

333
00:42:37,834 --> 00:42:41,546
It's just the wind. /
What wind?

334
00:43:02,442 --> 00:43:05,070
We have to leave. /
What's that? Let's go.

335
00:43:06,488 --> 00:43:08,740
Oh, shit. Go, go!

336
00:43:33,098 --> 00:43:36,268
What's wrong? /
I thought I heard something.

337
00:44:29,613 --> 00:44:31,698
Amanda?

338
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,494
Zack! / I'm sorry. /
Look at this.

339
00:44:38,246 --> 00:44:42,166
A teddy bear ? / Yeah. It wasn't here
before./ What are you talking about?

340
00:44:42,792 --> 00:44:47,547
Carter! Tracy! /
What the fuck! / Wake up!

341
00:44:49,716 --> 00:44:51,926
Look at this.
Look.

342
00:44:53,303 --> 00:44:56,389
It's hers, I just found it.

343
00:44:58,308 --> 00:45:02,728
Julie, this could be anybody's. / No, that's personalized
teddy bear. My little sister has the same one.

344
00:45:03,229 --> 00:45:06,565
Pretty funny coincidence, don't you think? /
Where did you find it?

345
00:45:06,566 --> 00:45:10,527
It was found it over there, but it wasn't there
before. / Well, obviously you just didn't see it.

346
00:45:10,528 --> 00:45:13,531
Or maybe someone came through here
with that little girl.

347
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,288
Hey, what are you doing? /
I'm calling the police.

348
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:24,375
Look, I'm screwed if they came by
figured that we're up here. / Seriously?

349
00:45:24,376 --> 00:45:27,962
That little girl is missing, and
you worried about getting into a trouble?

350
00:45:28,463 --> 00:45:32,383
I had reception area, what the hell. /
Look guys, I don't want rumors going around.

351
00:45:32,384 --> 00:45:36,220
My parents think that I'm staying
at Tanya's. / You guys are unbelievable!

352
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:41,101
That little girl could be out there somewhere,
so alive. We have to look./ In the middle of the night?

353
00:45:41,935 --> 00:45:46,730
Maybe she's right. / What, really, lover boy?
Or it's just your dick talking?

354
00:45:46,731 --> 00:45:50,651
Fuck you. / Guys, I don't think it's a good idea
to go marching up to the woods.

355
00:45:51,152 --> 00:45:54,614
If you are right, that girl's kidnapper
could be out here.

356
00:45:55,115 --> 00:45:57,200
Fine. Then I go by myself.

357
00:46:01,037 --> 00:46:04,499
We're all go. Right?

358
00:46:17,804 --> 00:46:21,182
Where is she? / I don't know.
Take out your camera.

359
00:46:21,683 --> 00:46:24,309
Why? / To document it,
just in case.

360
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:26,521
That's a good idea.

361
00:46:28,481 --> 00:46:32,442
You're on? / Yeah, yeah. Hurry up, it's gonna die./
Hi, I'm Max Reese at Open Hearth.

362
00:46:32,443 --> 00:46:35,488
If you find this, burn that house down.
The wicked is real!

363
00:46:35,989 --> 00:46:40,952
I broke a window. Then uh..
something came out of the house.

364
00:47:11,524 --> 00:47:13,985
Hairstrap from the picture.

365
00:47:17,614 --> 00:47:20,700
What was her name again? /
Amanda.

366
00:47:37,926 --> 00:47:42,204
This is creepy.
Can we just go?

367
00:47:45,141 --> 00:47:49,562
Julie! Go get her!
She's your date!

368
00:47:55,693 --> 00:48:00,572
Julie, what are you doing? / It's empty./
No shit. Let's get outta here.

369
00:48:00,573 --> 00:48:05,494
No. That teddy bear didn't just get up there
by itself. Someone kidnapped that girl.

370
00:48:05,995 --> 00:48:08,877
That's what kidnappers do.
Listen you have to call the police.

371
00:48:08,895 --> 00:48:12,877
I don't want to get any trouble.
Let's just get outta here. Come on.

372
00:48:15,171 --> 00:48:17,298
Julie.

373
00:48:21,678 --> 00:48:23,763


374
00:48:51,207 --> 00:48:53,250
Did you hear that? /
No.

375
00:48:53,751 --> 00:48:58,673
Well, it sounded like somebody's crying./
No, it didn't.

376
00:49:05,263 --> 00:49:08,140
This is all a gag, isn't it? /
What?

377
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:12,907
Carter placed that teddy bear out there.
You guys are just messing with me. Right?

378
00:49:12,941 --> 00:49:16,607
Very funny, Julie. You got me.
Let's go. Come on.

379
00:49:22,738 --> 00:49:26,826
Probably just the pipes. /
Yeah, the pipes.

380
00:49:31,914 --> 00:49:34,125
Julie.

381
00:49:36,627 --> 00:49:39,505
We have to pin it and get down there.

382
00:49:48,723 --> 00:49:50,975
Zack.

383
00:49:51,934 --> 00:49:54,145
Zack, I found it.

384
00:50:16,417 --> 00:50:18,586
You go look, Zack.

385
00:50:19,795 --> 00:50:23,466
You go look. /
Seriously?

386
00:50:27,303 --> 00:50:31,849
No, no. Okay. I'll go.
Just wait here.

387
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:51,744
Where did they go? /
Maybe they ran inside the house?

388
00:51:05,049 --> 00:51:08,719
Oh, shit.

389
00:51:35,955 --> 00:51:41,168
I think I heard something upstairs. / What? /
There's something in the house up there.

390
00:51:41,669 --> 00:51:44,672
Are you serious? /
Yes.

391
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:08,404
Carter, look.

392
00:52:22,001 --> 00:52:24,211
Hold this.

393
00:52:27,756 --> 00:52:30,551
Okay. Somebody's down there.

394
00:52:32,761 --> 00:52:35,055
Yes, yeah..

395
00:52:37,808 --> 00:52:40,186
Flashlight. /
Here.

396
00:52:44,648 --> 00:52:47,067
Oh my God! /
It's her.

397
00:52:49,153 --> 00:52:52,490
I'll get her hold up.
Guess it'll be easy.

398
00:52:55,784 --> 00:52:57,995
Good luck.

399
00:53:12,009 --> 00:53:14,010
Okay. All right.

400
00:53:14,511 --> 00:53:18,599
It's okay.
It's okay.

401
00:53:20,351 --> 00:53:23,854
It's okay.

402
00:53:27,733 --> 00:53:33,782
Okay. Get your feet up. No, no, no. It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay?

403
00:53:33,783 --> 00:53:35,282
We'll get you outta here.
You ready to go?

404
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:41,830
Yeah? You're going to hold on this.
I'll carry you out. Okay? Come on now.

405
00:53:46,168 --> 00:53:49,922
I'm right behind you. She's coming up.
She's almost there.

406
00:53:51,382 --> 00:53:55,135
You got her?  You got her? /
I got her.

407
00:53:58,389 --> 00:54:01,558
Okay.
It's okay.

408
00:54:10,734 --> 00:54:12,903
No, no, no, no, no..

409
00:54:14,321 --> 00:54:16,490
No...

410
00:54:30,504 --> 00:54:32,756
Where are they?

411
00:54:38,595 --> 00:54:41,181
Zack, get us outta here!

412
00:54:44,393 --> 00:54:46,769
They're trying to get out. /
Wait, wait. It might not be them.

413
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:50,649
But what if it is? /
I'm not going near that goddamn house.

414
00:54:52,317 --> 00:54:54,403
Fine. I am.

415
00:55:05,164 --> 00:55:08,542
Zack! /
I know! I know!

416
00:55:10,127 --> 00:55:12,337
Come on!

417
00:55:32,357 --> 00:55:36,195
Wait! We're running in circles.
We need a plan.

418
00:55:39,281 --> 00:55:44,160
It's her? What about the dude that took her?
He'll get coming after us.

419
00:55:44,661 --> 00:55:48,749
It's not a him.
It's the witch.

420
00:55:50,959 --> 00:55:52,627
What? /
It's not a ghost story, Carter.

421
00:55:53,128 --> 00:55:56,260
Right over there is graveyard
of camping shit, back down that house.

422
00:55:56,328 --> 00:56:00,260
Okay, she was in that cellar
wrapped in some cocoon or something.

423
00:56:04,598 --> 00:56:07,643
It comes from the camp. /
Shit, my car!

424
00:56:10,854 --> 00:56:13,857
Listen. I'll bring him back.
You're gonna stay with her. Keep her safe.

425
00:56:29,248 --> 00:56:33,835
Dude, my car is gone. /
Dude, everything is gone.

426
00:56:42,803 --> 00:56:47,014
You're just gonna leave us here?
Can we go to the truck, please?

427
00:56:47,015 --> 00:56:50,310
There is no truck.
Somebody stole it.

428
00:56:50,811 --> 00:56:54,105
She wants it. The girl. /
Are you believing this shit?

429
00:56:54,106 --> 00:56:56,987
It's real, Carter. We need to keep going.
We need to get outta here.

430
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,987
How are we gonna do that, genius?
It's 10 miles to the nearest town.

431
00:57:00,862 --> 00:57:04,300
What about that Ranger station? I mean,
the one we saw on the way down here.

432
00:57:04,362 --> 00:57:06,200
I mean, they might have phone or something.

433
00:57:06,201 --> 00:57:11,081
That's still 4 miles away. / You wanna wait here
for the witch to get you? Cause she's coming.

434
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:14,793
Carter, can we just go?

435
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:22,550
All right. Witch or not, whoever took her,
it is probably pissed off. So yeah, let's get outta here.

436
00:57:23,051 --> 00:57:26,513
Hey, wait a second. / What? /
Well, look!

437
00:57:27,014 --> 00:57:29,850
What is that? /
It's Max's bike.

438
00:57:33,478 --> 00:57:37,064
I mean, he must just followed us up here. /
That little prick took the car!

439
00:57:37,065 --> 00:57:39,609
Without the keys, Carter?

440
00:57:40,527 --> 00:57:44,656
Max! Max! /
Shut up, dude.

441
00:57:50,912 --> 00:57:53,081
What is it?

442
00:58:06,887 --> 00:58:09,222
Look at this.

443
00:58:12,642 --> 00:58:16,645
Look at that. / He's probably a half way home
with shit stain on underwear.

444
00:58:16,646 --> 00:58:20,316
What if he were not?
I'm gonna back to the house and find him.

445
00:58:20,817 --> 00:58:24,863
You could do it on your own. /
I'm not asking you, Carter. Am I?

446
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:34,622
Zack. You can't go back there.

447
00:58:35,123 --> 00:58:37,959
Would you leave your little sister up here?

448
00:58:40,212 --> 00:58:44,800
Listen, I can't just do that. Just call
the police and get her some help.

449
00:58:51,723 --> 00:58:53,642
Fuck it!

450
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:12,827
Okay, can we just slow it down? /
Yeah, yeah. You do whatever you want.

451
00:59:13,328 --> 00:59:16,456
You don't have to be such an ass, okay?

452
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:25,256
She's here. The wicked. /
Wait a minute. What? What did you say?

453
00:59:27,092 --> 00:59:32,889
She's already here. / Who? Who's already
here? What are you talking about?

454
00:59:51,658 --> 00:59:53,702
Shit.

455
01:00:11,052 --> 01:00:15,640
Tracy? /
Julie?

456
01:00:21,896 --> 01:00:24,024
Julie?

457
01:01:45,647 --> 01:01:47,487
What are you doing, Zack?

458
01:01:47,497 --> 01:01:52,987
Calm, they're not here. Let's go back
and catch up with the others.

459
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:03,289
She got Max.

460
01:02:49,836 --> 01:02:53,839
Where is he, Sammy? / She hides
him inside. Zack, we've gotta get him...

461
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:58,760
Listen to me. Hey, when we travel
back here, there's a county road nineteenth.

462
01:02:58,761 --> 01:03:01,584
There's a ranger station about a half../
We've gotta save him.. / Sammy!

463
01:03:01,591 --> 01:03:04,684
There's a phone there.
I need you to call for help.

464
01:03:05,476 --> 01:03:10,231
Listen to me, shitbrain.
I'm gonna get Max. Trust me.

465
01:03:11,733 --> 01:03:14,360
I need you to go.
Go, Sammy.

466
01:03:39,761 --> 01:03:41,637
Go.

467
01:04:58,714 --> 01:05:00,675
I'm coming, Max!

468
01:05:05,721 --> 01:05:10,893
I want my mommy. / It's okay, we...
we have to keep going.

469
01:05:16,482 --> 01:05:18,359
Come on. Come on.

470
01:06:36,646 --> 01:06:41,567
Carl, you've gotta take a look at this. /
No, thanks. I don't feel like to throwing up today.

471
01:06:42,068 --> 01:06:45,363
So the chinese call "The great wall of vagina".

472
01:06:46,906 --> 01:06:51,786
Have you been to China? / That's the size
the point. Just take a look at it.

473
01:06:55,998 --> 01:06:58,542
Is that legal? /
In what country?

474
01:06:59,043 --> 01:07:01,962
You pig. Button up your shirt.

475
01:07:04,131 --> 01:07:06,592
I'd like to "Mao Tse-Tongue" that.

476
01:07:31,909 --> 01:07:37,456
Baker County Sheriff Department? / <i>I, I need help.
All right. My friend.. my friend has been kidnapped. </i>

477
01:07:37,957 --> 01:07:42,544
Listen. There's this woman she's..
She has my friends and she's going to kill them.

478
01:07:43,045 --> 01:07:46,340
Hey, Carl. Carl, this voice sounds
familiar to you?

479
01:07:46,841 --> 01:07:52,596
<i> She dragged him into the basement or something,
I don't know. He's alive. Please. You've gotta help us.</i>

480
01:07:54,306 --> 01:07:59,144
Samantha? Hey, great to hear from you.
Sorry about your problem.

481
01:07:59,645 --> 01:08:07,235
We're gonna head over right now. Yeah, yeah.
We're on our way to.. That's a cop car. All right.

482
01:08:07,236 --> 01:08:09,196
Red roger. Squad's ready to run.

483
01:10:31,839 --> 01:10:34,715
Baker County Sheriff Department? /
<i>Listen, don't hang up. </i>

484
01:10:34,716 --> 01:10:40,930
Listen to me, you little fuck. We don't have time for this.
You do realize, prank 911 phone call is federal offence.

485
01:10:40,931 --> 01:10:46,644
Yes, you damn bitch. Which this time is not a joke. /
Yeah. Well, good bye! / <i>Wait, Mahoney, wait!</i>

486
01:10:46,645 --> 01:10:50,341
You know who this is, right?
<i>I admit to everything. </i>

487
01:10:50,345 --> 01:10:52,651
<i>I'm the one who use to make
all these prank phone calls.</i>

488
01:10:53,735 --> 01:10:57,276
Tell Carl, if he'll come and arrest me.
Tell him, tell him..

489
01:10:57,289 --> 01:11:01,576
<i>I'm gonna post that picture from getting eyed
all over the internet. I swear to God I'll do it.</i>

490
01:11:02,744 --> 01:11:07,250
Hey, you little shit! <i>Kid, listen. This is
all on tape. When you do show your face..</i>

491
01:11:07,284 --> 01:11:09,250
<i>..you're going to juvenile halt.</i>

492
01:11:09,751 --> 01:11:13,090
Do you know what happens to deputy
to get cought doing drugs?

493
01:11:13,095 --> 01:11:16,090
You're not gonna get a job working
security in a graveyard.

494
01:11:16,091 --> 01:11:19,011
<i>Too bad you didn't trace
this call, deputy dickhead.</i>

495
01:11:22,181 --> 01:11:29,604
Get her location. / Yo, Carl, she's fucking with you.
She's fucking with you. Just let it go. Just let it go.

496
01:11:34,818 --> 01:11:37,070
Thank you, Debbie.

497

Go!

Max, let's go. Let's go!

504
01:18:12,799 --> 01:18:15,009
She won't let us out.

505

There, upstairs. Come on.

506
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:27,563
Ready? Come on.
One, two, three.

Look at there!
Come out here.

509
01:19:09,689 --> 01:19:15,360
Somewhere outta here. / Who with? / A witch. /
Halloween's up another 5 months.

510
01:19:15,361 --> 01:19:19,335
You don't understand, Carl.
They're going to die!

511
01:19:19,361 --> 01:19:23,535
You don't understand. You have no idea
how badly I wanted to bring you back brute.

512
01:19:23,536 --> 01:19:27,581
You're hurting me! / Just a little bruises
for a little girl who's very bad.

513
01:19:27,582 --> 01:19:30,209
They're at Open Hearth, Carl. I'm serious! /
I'm not gonna like that, though.

514
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:35,255
And I'm gonna enjoy watching you rot
in juvenile halt.. / Carl, listen!

515
01:19:35,256 --> 01:19:37,554
All those stories about
the wicked, they're all true.

516
01:19:37,556 --> 01:19:41,554
The witch, she.. she's somewhere
out there. She's going to kill them!

517
01:19:42,513 --> 01:19:45,308
You have the right to remain silent!

518
01:19:47,268 --> 01:19:51,647
Find another way! Find another way!
God!

519
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:58,237

Go, go, go, go!
Go, Max!

Come on! Help us!
Come on, what's wrong with you?

526
01:20:47,662 --> 01:20:52,917
They did it. We're okay, Amanda.

527
01:20:56,587 --> 01:20:59,465
What the hell happened down here?
You guys all right?

528
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:58,941
No! No! No! No! /
Max!

529

Max, Max. It's me,
Max! It's me. / Zack!

530
01:22:10,911 --> 01:22:13,122
To the tree.
Come on.

531
01:22:16,625 --> 01:22:19,503
We've gotta break her spells. /
How?

532
01:22:20,004 --> 01:22:24,925
I don't know. /
Wait a second.

533
01:22:25,426 --> 01:22:30,639
Grandpa always talked abouth witches and shit, right? /
Yeah./ I mean, I never believed in these, but you did.

534
01:22:31,807 --> 01:22:34,893
Grandpa never said anything to you? /
Nothing ever help.

535
01:22:35,394 --> 01:22:37,957
All right, listen to me. She can't move
in place at once, right?

536
01:22:37,994 --> 01:22:40,357
I don't know, she can do fucking anything.

537
01:22:40,858 --> 01:22:47,238
Listen to me. This is what we're gonna do.
When it's quiet, you follow that road to Speeder Point.

538
01:22:47,239 --> 01:22:50,477
No, we've gotta to stay together. /
We can't stay together, Max. Listen to me.

539
01:22:50,489 --> 01:22:52,077
We stay together, she's going to get us both.

540
01:22:52,578 --> 01:22:57,966
I'm fucking afraid, Zack. / Listen, dont' be.
Grandpa's watching over us, right? Right?

541
01:22:59,293 --> 01:23:03,505
He is, Max. And you should
believe that, Max.

542
01:23:04,006 --> 01:23:07,993
That's all. Remember when
it gets quiet. Just go.

543
01:23:09,929 --> 01:23:14,892
You can do this. You can do this,
we're almost home. We're almost home.

544
01:23:18,771 --> 01:23:23,400
Zack! / Come on,
you stupid bitch! Come here!

545
01:23:37,498 --> 01:23:43,920
Turn around, you dick! / Everything
you say can and will be used against you.

546
01:23:43,921 --> 01:23:48,217
Just take a look, that's all I'm asking.
Just drive up there.

547
01:23:49,176 --> 01:23:53,180
I'm not wasting my time.
So, shut your fucking mouth.

01:34:21,516 --> 01:34:24,143
Witch bottles? /
What?

582
01:34:24,644 --> 01:34:28,480
Like the one grandpa gave me.
The only way to ward off the witch's spell.

583
01:34:28,981 --> 01:34:32,045
What do you do with it? /
Put something of yourself in it.

584
01:34:32,081 --> 01:34:34,945
Uh.. hair, nail clipping, blood,
anything. The repelling spell.

585
01:34:34,946 --> 01:34:40,326
Then why would she had it? /
She's using them too.

586
01:34:40,827 --> 01:34:43,538
That's how she stayed safe.
They protect her.

587
01:34:44,622 --> 01:34:49,793
It's gonna be more powerful than hair, right?/ At this
point, I'll take a crap in it, if it worked. Just hurry!

588
01:34:49,794 --> 01:34:52,088
Give me your hand.

589
01:35:20,199 --> 01:35:24,162
It worked! / Come on! /
We've gotta stop her!

590
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:43,931
Let's go!

591
01:36:14,837 --> 01:36:17,048
It's not working.

592
01:36:34,857 --> 01:36:37,902
Max.. witch's burn.

593
01:37:03,052 --> 01:37:05,137
Max.

594
01:37:07,807 --> 01:37:10,309
Abra cadabra, you ugly bitch!

595
01:38:52,578 --> 01:38:59,459
Zack? / Julie.
It's okay. It's all right.

596
01:39:07,301 --> 01:39:09,511
Have you seen Carter?

597
01:39:13,557 --> 01:39:17,185
And the witch, Zack?

598
01:39:17,686 --> 01:39:19,813
Dad.

599
01:39:33,327 --> 01:39:36,956
Dad...
This is Julie.

600
01:39:41,585 --> 01:39:45,233
You guys absolutely sure
there's someone in that house?

601
01:39:45,285 --> 01:39:48,633
Yeah. We set her on fire.
We trapped her in the cellar.

602
01:39:48,634 --> 01:39:52,513
Well, there's no other bodies
in that house. There's nothing.

603
01:39:53,806 --> 01:39:57,433
That means she got away. /
No, she didn't get away.

604
01:39:57,434 --> 01:39:59,774
I have a 10 mile radius set-up
and block around here.

605
01:39:59,775 --> 01:40:03,774
If there's anybody out there,
she won't get far. Trust me.

606
01:40:13,826 --> 01:40:16,036
House and mirrors.

607
01:40:32,761 --> 01:40:37,765
<i>Even if the festival continued with a good news,
that 7 year old Amanda Drake is recovering.. <i>

608
01:40:37,766 --> 01:40:40,397
<i>...and has been upgraded
to fair condition, </i>

609
01:40:40,466 --> 01:40:44,897
<i>..we are hearing that the suspect
has still not been found and remains at large.</i>

610
01:40:44,898 --> 01:40:50,945
<i>The house where it all took place, of course,
has been a piece of local folklore for generations.</i>

611
01:40:50,946 --> 01:40:55,867
<i>Bit local kids insisting the legend is true.
And that Ladine Lorene..</i>

612
01:40:55,868 --> 01:40:59,662
<i>..is in fact, a witch.
And still very much alive.</i>

613
01:40:59,663 --> 01:41:03,545
<i>It seems awhole new generations of children
are being frighten into believing, </i>

614
01:41:03,563 --> 01:41:07,045
<i>..that the wicked is just
outside their window.</i>

615
01:41:08,551 --> 01:41:37,722
