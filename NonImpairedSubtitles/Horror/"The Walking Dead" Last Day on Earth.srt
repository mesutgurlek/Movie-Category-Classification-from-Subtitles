That's the last of it.

498
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,884
If you see a car,
try to siphon the gas.

499
00:43:21,886 --> 00:43:24,303
Other than that, you keep moving.

500
00:43:24,305 --> 00:43:26,672
I'll have them thinking
we're playing their game.

501
00:43:26,674 --> 00:43:29,058
All phases of the turn,
level after level,

502
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,226
move after move, I'll keep them spun.

503
00:43:31,228 --> 00:43:32,811
I assure you, I will.

504
00:43:35,266 --> 00:43:38,100
I got something for you.

505
00:43:38,102 --> 00:43:41,687
It's a recipe, and it ain't gazpacho.

506
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:47,576
How to Build Bullets 101.

507
00:43:47,578 --> 00:43:50,863
Abraham can show you
where, just in case.

508
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,339
Thank you for this.

509
00:44:00,341 --> 00:44:02,458
For all of it.

510
00:44:04,712 --> 00:44:07,513
We're lucky you're here.

511
00:44:07,515 --> 00:44:09,815
I won't argue with that.

512

(chuckles)

513
00:44:15,423 --> 00:44:17,389
You go steady on the pedal.

514

You don't make that thing gulp.

515
00:44:21,128 --> 00:44:23,529
How come you never
let me drive the truck?

516
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:30,652
I didn't think you could do it.

517
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:37,242
I was wrong.

518
00:44:37,244 --> 00:44:39,578
You're a survivor.

We just didn't know it.

522
00:44:49,256 --> 00:44:51,423
Me and you both.

523

Hi.

You're Rick, right?

586
00:53:52,082 --> 00:53:54,749
I'm Negan.

587
00:53:54,751 --> 00:53:58,420
And I do not appreciate
you killing my men.

588
00:53:58,422 --> 00:54:01,423
Also, when I sent my people

589
00:54:01,425 --> 00:54:04,376
to kill your people
for killing my people,

590
00:54:04,378 --> 00:54:06,878
you killed more of my people.

591
00:54:08,715 --> 00:54:11,683
Not cool.

592
00:54:11,685 --> 00:54:13,351
Not cool.

593
00:54:13,353 --> 00:54:16,855
You have no idea

594
00:54:16,857 --> 00:54:18,890
how not cool that shit is.

595
00:54:18,892 --> 00:54:23,061
But I think you're gonna
be up to speed shortly.

596
00:54:26,116 --> 00:54:27,565
Yeah.

597
00:54:29,403 --> 00:54:32,821
You are so gonna regret
crossing me in a few minutes.

598
00:54:35,542 --> 00:54:37,375
Yes, you are.

599
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:43,081
You see, Rick, whatever you do,

600
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:46,384
no matter what, you don't mess
with the new world order.

601

And the new world order is this,
and it's really very simple.

So, even if you're stupid,

00:55:09,776 --> 00:55:12,777

Today was career day.

609
00:55:22,956 --> 00:55:24,873
We invested a lot

610
00:55:24,875 --> 00:55:29,711
so you would know who I am
and what I can do.

611
00:55:31,348 --> 00:55:34,132
You work for me now.

612
00:55:34,134 --> 00:55:37,469
You have shit, you give it to me.

613
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,554
That's your job.

614

<i>Now, I know that is a mighty big,</i>

616

you most certainly will.

617
00:55:57,741 --> 00:55:59,290
You ruled the roost.

618
00:55:59,292 --> 00:56:03,578
You built something.

<i>You thought you were safe.</i>

620
00:56:07,801 --> 00:56:10,835
<i>I get it.</i>

621
00:56:10,837 --> 00:56:14,556
<i>But the word is out.</i>

622
00:56:16,009 --> 00:56:19,511
You are not safe.

623
00:56:21,264 --> 00:56:23,348
Not even close.

624
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:25,850
In fact, you are pegged,

625
00:56:25,852 --> 00:56:27,852
more pegged if you don't
do what I want.

626
00:56:27,854 --> 00:56:30,572
And what I want is half your shit.

627
00:56:30,574 --> 00:56:33,942
<i>And if that's too much, you can
make, find, or steal more,</i>

628
00:56:33,944 --> 00:56:36,528
<i>and it'll even out sooner or later.</i>

629
00:56:39,032 --> 00:56:42,667
This is your way of life now.

630
00:56:42,669 --> 00:56:46,838
The more you fight back,
the harder it will be.

631
00:56:47,874 --> 00:56:52,210
So, if someone knocks on your door...

632
00:56:53,547 --> 00:56:55,046
(chuckles)

633
00:56:55,048 --> 00:56:56,347
...you let us in.

634
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:59,384
We own that door.

635
00:56:59,386 --> 00:57:01,686
You try to stop us

636
00:57:01,688 --> 00:57:05,106
and we will knock it down.

637
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:09,727
You understand?

638
00:57:12,899 --> 00:57:15,567
What, no answer?

639
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:22,407
You don't really think that you
were gonna get through this

640
00:57:22,409 --> 00:57:24,742
without being punished, now, did you?

641
00:57:26,746 --> 00:57:28,963
<i>I don't want to kill you people.</i>

642
00:57:28,965 --> 00:57:31,466
<i>Just want to make that
clear from the get-go.</i>

643
00:57:32,586 --> 00:57:34,919
I want you to work for me.

644
00:57:34,921 --> 00:57:38,923
You can't do that if
you're dead, now, can you?

645
00:57:42,095 --> 00:57:45,096
I'm not growing a garden.

646
00:57:48,018 --> 00:57:52,654
But you killed my people,
a whole damn lot of them.

647
00:57:52,656 --> 00:57:54,856
More than I'm comfortable with.

648
00:57:54,858 --> 00:57:58,643
And for that, for that
you're gonna pay.

649
00:58:02,582 --> 00:58:04,716
<i>So, now...</i>

650
00:58:08,171 --> 00:58:12,290
I'm gonna beat the holy hell

662
00:59:24,364 --> 00:59:28,333
Shit, kid, lighten up.

663
00:59:29,953 --> 00:59:32,203
At least cry a little.

664
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:37,458
(chuckles)

665
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:42,463
Ahem.

666
00:59:45,769 --> 00:59:47,518
(sniffles)

667
00:59:50,523 --> 00:59:52,890
Jesus.

668
00:59:52,892 --> 00:59:55,643
You look shitty.

669
00:59:57,447 --> 00:59:59,280
I should just put you
out of your misery right now.

670
00:59:59,282 --> 01:00:01,950
Glenn:
No! No!

671
01:00:01,952 --> 01:00:04,535
-<i> (blows landing)</i>
- Stop it!

672
01:00:04,537 --> 01:00:08,623
God--!
(grunting)

673
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:10,541
Nope.

674
01:00:10,543 --> 01:00:14,045
- Nope, get him back in line.
- Glenn:<i> No.</i>

675
01:00:14,047 --> 01:00:16,831
(grunts)
No.

676
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:18,082
<i>No.</i>

677
01:00:18,084 --> 01:00:23,254
(groaning)

678
01:00:23,256 --> 01:00:27,759
(sobs, yells)

679
01:00:27,761 --> 01:00:30,011
Don't.

680
01:00:30,013 --> 01:00:31,479
<i>Don't.</i>

681
01:00:31,481 --> 01:00:34,182
(chuckles)

682
01:00:34,184 --> 01:00:36,901
All right, listen.

683
01:00:36,903 --> 01:00:40,855
Don't any of you do that again.

684
01:00:40,857 --> 01:00:44,525
I will shut that shit down,
no exceptions.

685
01:00:46,446 --> 01:00:47,912
First one's free.

686
01:00:47,914 --> 01:00:52,116
It's an emotional moment, I get it.

687
01:01:06,933 --> 01:01:09,467
Sucks, don't it?

688
01:01:09,469 --> 01:01:13,304
The moment you realize
you don't know shit.

689
01:01:28,288 --> 01:01:30,738
This is your kid, right?

690
01:01:32,859 --> 01:01:35,326
(laughs)

691
01:01:35,328 --> 01:01:37,729
This is definitely your kid.

692
01:01:37,731 --> 01:01:40,882
- Just stop this!
- Hey!

693
01:01:40,884 --> 01:01:44,802
Do not make me kill the
little future serial killer.

694
01:01:44,804 --> 01:01:46,888
Don't make it easy on me.

695
01:01:48,842 --> 01:01:51,676
I gotta pick somebody.

696
01:01:51,678 --> 01:01:55,430
Everybody's at the table
waiting for me to order.

697
01:01:58,651 --> 01:02:03,104
(whistling)

698
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:17,668
I simply cannot decide.

699
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:19,337
(chuckles)

700
01:02:23,843 --> 01:02:26,043
I got an idea.

701
01:02:29,015 --> 01:02:30,548
(chuckles)

702
01:02:34,137 --> 01:02:35,803

If...

he hollers...

712
01:03:03,416 --> 01:03:05,416
let him go.

713
01:03:07,137 --> 01:03:09,303
My mother...

714
01:03:09,305 --> 01:03:10,488
<i>told me...</i>

715
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:11,973

it.

720
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:35,112
Anybody moves, anybody says anything,

721
01:03:35,114 --> 01:03:37,782
cut the boy's other eye out
and feed it to his father

722
01:03:37,784 --> 01:03:39,834
and then we'll start.

723
01:03:39,836 --> 01:03:41,369
You can breathe,

724
01:03:41,371 --> 01:03:43,087
you can blink,

725
01:03:43,089 --> 01:03:45,173
you can cry.

726
01:03:45,175 --> 01:03:48,593
Hell, you're all gonna be doing that.

727
01:03:48,595 --> 01:03:49,627
(all scream)

Look at that.

730
01:03:56,719 --> 01:03:59,937
Taking it like a champ!
