1
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,742
Am I staring?

2
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,413
A little.

3
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:16,415
Sorry.

4
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:18,417
You just have such
beautiful skin.

5
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,324
I'm Ruby, by the way.

6
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:32,764
Do you have a name,

7
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,466
or you want me to guess?

8
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:37,936
Jesse.

9
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,104
Jesse.

10
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,042
And you just got to la, Jesse?

11
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,916
How did you know?

12
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:51,918
You've got that look.

13
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,689
Oh, don't worry, honey.

14
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,625
That whole deer-in-the-headlights
thing is exactly what they want.

15
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,039
Here. Let me
help you with that.

16
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:19,945
Are you a model?

17
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,548
No, I do makeup.

18
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,553
So, where are you staying?

19
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,024
At a motel in Pasadena.

20
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,760
By yourself?

21
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:35,762
Mmm-hmm.

22
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,010
What do your parents
think about that?

23
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,700
They don't really.

24
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,073
Don't think, or just don't care?

25
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,079
They're not around anymore.

26
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,517
I'm sorry.

27
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,728
Hey, you wanna go somewhere?

28
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:12,964
Where?

29
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,967
A party.

30
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,439
What kind of party?

31
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,075
The fun kind.

32
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,821
God, I love this color on me.

33
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,557
Red rum.

34
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,559
What?

35
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,693
That's what it's called.

36
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,163
They say women are more
likely to buy a lipstick

37
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:55,200
if it's named after food or sex.

38
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,306
Just think about it.

39
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:02,574
Black honey.

40
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:04,843
Plum passion.

41
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,178
Peachy keen.

42
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,615
Pink pussy.

43
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:15,067
What about you, Sarah, what
would your lipstick be called?

44
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:16,988
Fuck off.

45
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,190
Apt.

46
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,094
What about you?

47
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,731
What about me?

48
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,604
Are you food

49
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,576
or are you sex?

50
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,848
She's dessert
because she's so sweet.

51
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,258
Hmm.

52
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,232
Shouldn't we get
back to the party?

53
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,234
Don't talk.

54
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,037
Still.

55
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,750
So what do we think?

56
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,388
I think that I wish
I had your hair.

57
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,223
Is this your natural color?

58
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,961
You are just so beautiful.

59
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,523
Don't you think that
she's just perfect?

60
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,301
Is that your real nose?

61
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,670
Yeah.

62
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,641
God, life is so unfair.

63
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,275
Gigi just got out
of the body shop.

64
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,944
She's still a little sensitive.

65
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:47,846
You had work done?

66
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,916
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

67
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,985
Sweet, plastics is
just good grooming.

68
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,420
Imagine going a year without

69
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:56,422
brushing your teeth.

70
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,891
I go to this guy
in Beverly hills.

71
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,760
- Andrew.
- Dr. Andrew.

72
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,194
She is in love with him.

73
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,763
Of course I love him.

74
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,097
Look at me.

75
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,259
He calls me the bionic woman.

76
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,802
Is that a compliment?

77
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,743
I hear your parents are dead.

78
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,025
That must be
really hard for you.

79
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:24,916
Do you have other family?

80
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,253
No.

81
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,255
No one at all?

82
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,991
You must have a boyfriend.

83
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,103
All she really wants to know
is, who are you fucking?

84
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,807
Sorry?

85
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:49,809
What?

86
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,112
Isn't that what
everyone wants to know?

87
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,715
A pretty new girl walks into a
room, everyone's head turns,

88
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,483
looks her up and down,
wondering,

89
00:11:58,485 --> 00:11:59,818
"who is she fucking?

90
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,153
"Who could she fuck?

91
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,491
"And how high can she climb,
and is it higher than me?"

92
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,031
I don't...
I don't know.

93
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,333
I just got to town, so I
don't know anybody here.

94
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,936
Right. But you've
slept with men before.

95
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,218
You do sleep
with men, don't you?

96
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,378
All the time.

97
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,320
I think I will get
back to the party.

98
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,790
Someone said there
was gonna be a show.

99
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,323
Jesse, are you coming?

100
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,151
Who did you say shot these?
A boyfriend?

101
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,327
Not really.

102
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,429
Not really or no?

103
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,365
No.

104
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,136
It was just some guy,
he found me online.

105
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,606
Be careful with that.

106
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,179
You're very fit.

107
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,416
Thank you.

108
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:32,517
You're also very young.

109
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,586
I think you're perfect.

110
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,389
I would never say you're fat.

111
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,592
But that doesn't mean
that someone else won't.

112
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:42,594
Understand?

113
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,367
I see 20 or 30 girls
come in here every day.

114
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:53,538
Mostly from small towns
with big dreams

115
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,606
because some guy named Chad
in the food court told them

116
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,508
they were beautiful
enough to be a model.

117
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,644
And they're all good.

118
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:01,612
You...

119
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,384
You're going to be great.

120
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,257
Some girls crack under the
pressure, but if you do okay,

121
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,392
then we are off to New York.

122
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,729
You'll work with
all the top designers.

123
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,431
International success.

124
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,470
So the first thing we need to do

125
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,738
is get you some pictures that
are a little less amateur hour,

126
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,740
no offense.

127
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,856
Jack MacArthur is in town.
Do you know him?

128
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,581
No.

129
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,583
Get to know him.

130
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,786
I had to pull some strings,

131
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,855
but I sent him your Polaroids,

132
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:45,556
and he has agreed to
do a test with you.

133
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,192
How does that sound?

134
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,595
It sounds great.

135
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,497
It sounds...

136
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:54,432
Sounds good.

137
00:18:56,401 --> 00:19:00,438
Well, there's just
a teensy bit of paperwork.

138
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,507
I'll need a copy of your driver's
license and a voided check,

139
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:03,749
and I can take those right now.

140
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,004
When did you graduate
from high school?

141
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,555
I'm actually still
kind of working on it.

142
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,764
I need a parental consent form.

143
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:35,706
You can go.

144
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:39,777
Parental consent form.

145
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,350
Just one signature there
for parental consent.

146
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,353
One little signature
and we're off.

147
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,525
When someone asks, I want
you to say you are 19.

148
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,461
Always 19.

149
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,596
Eighteen is too on the nose.

150
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,200
No one's going to believe that.

151
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,269
Honey.

152
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,771
People believe
what they are told.

153
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,673
Hi.
Hi.

154
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:16,907
I have... I bought
you flowers, but...

155
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,676
Oh. Sorry.
You go.

156
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:21,412
No, you first.

157
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:24,582
I was just gonna say
I signed with that agency.

158
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,584
That's great news.
Congratulations.

159
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:27,586
Thanks.

160
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,547
Hey, did they say anything
about my pictures?

161
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,859
Didn't come up.

162
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,428
Cool, that's cool.

163
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,430
Come on.

164
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,213
Don't forget me when
you're all famous now.

165
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,921
In Georgia, the sky
is also this big.

166
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:13,791
Makes being a person down
on earth feel really small.

167
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,997
You could feel small here, too.

168
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:22,867
Do you?

169
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:25,669
Sometimes.

170
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:29,707
When I was a kid,

171
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,943
I would sneak out
onto the roof at night.

172
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:39,583
I thought the moon
looked like a big round eye.

173
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,822
And I would look up and I'd say,

174
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,425
"do you see me?"

175
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,829
I would stay out
there for hours.

176
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,033
Sometimes I'd fall
asleep just dreaming.

177
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:58,869
About what?

178
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,042
What I would be.

179
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,045
What was that?

180
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,015
I could never figure it out.

181
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,085
I can't sing.
I can't dance.

182
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,987
I can't write.

183
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,456
No real talent.

184
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,062
But I'm pretty,

185
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,600
and I can make money off pretty.

186
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:30,602
So...

187
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,773
I think you're probably
good at a lot of things.

188
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:37,842
You can't tell.

189
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,511
We just met.

190
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:41,513
We didn't just meet.

191
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,048
We met the other day.

192
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:46,784
Trust me.

193
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,687
I can tell.

194
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,068
They want me to lie.

195
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,805
Who wants you to lie?

196
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,175
The agency.

197
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,880
They want me to say I'm 19.

198
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,114
How old are you?

199
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,818
Sixteen last month.

200
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,268
You know, I think I left
the stove on at home.

201
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,669
Stop.

202
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:46,710
Listen. I think

203
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,715
you ought to do what
you think is right.

204
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:14,972
I should go.

205
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,250
Bye.
Bye.

206
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,284
Thank you.

207
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:54,812
Jesse.

208
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,224
Do you wanna go out again?

209
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:09,727
Yeah. That...

210
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,329
That'd be cool.

211
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,321
Yeah?

212
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:12,923
Something's in my room.

213
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,391
What do you mean,
something's in your room?

214
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:15,726
I saw something in my room.

215
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,029
Are you high?

216
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:24,768
What are you doing?

217
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,869
Calling the police.

218
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:26,871
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

219
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,373
Relax, okay?

220
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:32,910
Mikey.

221
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:33,912
Yeah?

222
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:37,414
This lady has an unwanted guest.

223
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,051
212.

224
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:24,161
All right, asshole.
Party's over.

225
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:25,462
Open up.

226
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:28,866
Give me the key.

227
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:47,384
Mikey, open the door.

228
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,963
Mikey.

229
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,867
The fuck?

230
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,370
You're paying for this.

231
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,807
I didn't do it.

232
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,449
You fucking kids are
all the fucking same.

233
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,144
I will find you.

234
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,146
Got it?

235
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,248
There's your visitor.

236
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:36,586
You're done.

237
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,559
Let's go show him.

238
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,266
Jack?

239
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,035
Ready, ready.

240
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:08,719
Take off your shoes.

241
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,397
All right, everybody.

242
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:30,500
Thank you for your work.

243
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,470
It's gonna be a closed set.

244
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,489
I don't mind staying.
It's not a problem.

245
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:53,491
We're good.

246
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,412
Take off your clothes.

247
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:41,872
Is there a problem?

248
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,212
All of it.

249
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:20,277
Turn around.

250
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,769
Jesse.

251
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,511
You're still here?

252
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,580
How did it go?

253
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:46,516
It went good.

254
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:49,085
It was great actually.

255
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:51,688
Did he say anything?

256
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,793
My agency said if the
pictures turned out good,

257
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:58,428
he might consider them
for an editorial.

258
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:00,830
Do you think he would?

259
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,935
I think he makes a lot of
promises to young girls.

260
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,076
I should go, before
my meter runs out.

261
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:15,011
I don't think you should
be alone with him.

262
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,151
He seemed fine to me.

263
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,621
That's not what
I'm saying, Jesse.

264
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,562
I'm not as helpless as I look.

265
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:41,938
Will you promise me something?

266
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,907
Will you call me
if you need anything?

267
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,876
Night or day.
Doesn't matter.

268
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:48,978
Give me your phone.

269
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:54,917
It's good to have
good girls around.

270
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:00,857
You promise you'll call?

271
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,860
I promise.

272
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,072
Thank you for the makeup today.

273
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:24,547
Sorry I'm late.

274
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:26,649
Would you like
to hear the specials?

275
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,017
Sure.

276
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,786
You're not gonna eat it.

277
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:32,055
But they work so hard
to memorize them.

278
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:32,055
Today we have

279
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:35,825
a loaded baked potato
with a side of broccoli,

280
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,094
a pan-seared Halibut served
with rice and a fruit cup,

281
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:40,497
and a steak sandwich
that comes with fries.

282
00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:42,866
If I don't want fries, could
I substitute the fruit cup?

283
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:43,900
If you just want the fruit,

284
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:46,069
you'll have to
order the fruit bowl.

285
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:48,805
How about we just have three
coffees and a fruit cup?

286
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:52,909
How was the shoot?

287
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:56,980
Jesse was there.

288
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,182
Who?

289
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:03,553
Oh, yeah, her.

290
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:06,890
Why?

291
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:08,191
Jack was shooting her.

292
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:09,193
What?

293
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,196
She's been in town
for, like, a minute.

294
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:14,931
They brought her in for a test.

295
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:16,833
Jack doesn't test new models.

296
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:17,835
Well, he does now.

297
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,273
Apparently, they think she
is gonna be this giant star.

298
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:26,242
Jack shoots me all the time.

299
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:29,779
That's not gonna last.

300
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:32,315
What's that supposed to mean?

301
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:34,250
It means your expiration
date is almost due.

302
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,087
Who wants sour milk when
you can get fresh meat?

303
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:41,824
Right.

304
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,564
Sarah, these girls
come and go all the time.

305
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,633
She's not special yet.

306
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:52,702
Mmm...

307
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:54,837
But you have to admit,
there is something about her.

308
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:56,739
Like what?

309
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,741
She's young, and she's thin.

310
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,144
No, it's more than that.

311
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:06,316
She has that

312
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:07,684
thing.

313
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,152
Thank you.

314
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:47,056
Erin.

315
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:48,858
So the same.
Straight back.

316
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,137
This way, ladies.

317
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:08,411
So do straight
back between the pillars,

318
00:44:08,413 --> 00:44:09,746
and then right back here.

319
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,159
Okay.
Thank you very much.

320
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:26,796
Next.

321
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:31,934
Robert, you remember Sarah?

322
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:39,409
Oh.

323
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:42,311
Let's just see the walk.

324
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,170
Should I go again?

325
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,809
No, thank you, that will be all.

326
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,454
Could you come forward, please?

327
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:30,426
This is Jesse.

328
00:45:58,355 --> 00:45:59,355
Where's your card?

329
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,458
I don't have one yet.

330
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:05,194
Jesse's new in town,

331
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:07,263
but she's just been signed
by Roberta Hoffmann.

332
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:08,397
How old are you?

333
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:11,968
Nineteen.

334
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:15,838
Any runway experience?

335
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:18,808
Not really.

336
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:22,651
Okay, let's see the walk, dear.

337
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,557
Thank you. We'll take
her to measurements.

338
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:03,085
Thank you.

339
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:10,393
Lift up.

340
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:52,261
You should really fix this.

341
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,329
I don't wanna fix it.

342
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,708
I thought you did great.

343
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:08,244
Honest.

344
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:13,482
Don't do that.

345
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,087
Pretend that you don't know.

346
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,957
People see you.

347
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,359
They notice.

348
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,967
Do you know how lucky you are?

349
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:35,671
I'm a ghost.

350
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:45,414
What's it feel like?

351
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,686
What do you mean?

352
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:54,457
To walk into a room,

353
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,495
and it's like
in the middle of winter,

354
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:00,563
you're the sun.

355
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,602
It's everything.

356
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:14,010
Ow!

357
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,380
- Oh, shit.
- Let me see.

358
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,159
Stop! Stop!

359
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,432
Sorry, I'm late.

360
00:51:09,434 --> 00:51:10,434
Hey. No problem.

361
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:22,725
Are you the manager?

362
00:54:22,727 --> 00:54:24,627
Depends who's asking.

363
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:26,149
My friend says she
owes you some money.

364
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:28,831
Room 212.

365
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:31,734
Oh, the wildcat.

366
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,904
That's some real hard candy.

367
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:37,273
You know what I mean?

368
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,441
I beg your pardon?

369
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:41,844
What, are you a Mormon?

370
00:54:41,846 --> 00:54:42,846
No, sir.

371
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,849
Are you with the DPH?
No.

372
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:48,291
'Cause we passed
our last inspection.

373
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,052
I can show you the
paperwork if you want.

374
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:55,924
She said she owes
you for the damages.

375
00:54:55,926 --> 00:54:59,762
I should charge her
for emotional distress.

376
00:54:59,764 --> 00:55:02,331
You know how long it took to
get that thing out of here?

377
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:03,976
Well, I don't think
she should have to pay.

378
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,768
That so?

379
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,336
Yeah. I mean, technically
it wasn't her fault.

380
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:09,405
Not her fault?

381
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:11,373
Who do you think left
the sliding door open?

382
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:12,708
Yeah, but I don't see how that makes...
Was it you?

383
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:14,009
No. Sure as hell wasn't me.

384
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:17,313
How much?

385
00:55:17,315 --> 00:55:19,682
New door plus labor.

386
00:55:19,684 --> 00:55:20,916
At least 100.

387
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:27,923
Or was it two?

388
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:35,030
I have 140 in cash. Sold.

389
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:43,706
Is there a pharmacy around here?

390
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,574
Why?

391
00:55:45,576 --> 00:55:48,644
She send you out
for tampons, too?

392
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:51,006
You know, you've got a real
attitude problem, you know that?

393
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:54,616
I'm just being friendly.

394
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:55,884
I just wanna make sure

395
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:57,419
you're getting something
out of this deal.

396
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:58,421
'Cause if you're not,

397
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:02,358
got plenty of other girls here.

398
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,694
Take a peek in room 214
if you get a chance.

399
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:08,397
Rented it this week to a
girl from Sandusky, Ohio.

400
00:56:08,399 --> 00:56:09,798
Runaway.

401
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,833
Thirteen years old.

402
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,835
Real Lolita shit.

403
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:15,704
Real Lolita shit.

404
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:18,941
Room 214.

405
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,677
Gotta be seen.

406
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,082
Jesse?

407
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:02,484
What are you doing here?

408
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:05,454
They told me to wait.

409
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:06,688
For what?

410
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:08,957
For makeup.

411
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:11,727
You're in the show?

412
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:13,996
Yeah.

413
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:16,098
This show?

414
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:18,901
Yes.

415
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:23,505
That's my chair.

416
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:37,886
Well.

417
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:40,589
You certainly move fast.

418
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,125
What do you mean?

419
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,562
You must be fucking him.

420
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:48,524
Sarno doesn't let just
anyone walk his collection.

421
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:51,834
I don't think I'm his type.

422
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:53,836
Why not?

423
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:55,204
You're very masculine.

424
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:00,068
I bet they made you
do the casting.

425
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:04,046
I didn't have to.

426
00:58:04,048 --> 00:58:05,914
I just come in,
choose what I wanna wear.

427
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:09,485
But I'm not sure about
the makeup this year.

428
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,057
I think you look perfect.

429
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:18,827
Yeah.

430
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:20,762
Well, flattery will
get you everywhere.

431
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:24,066
You wanna know what
I had done, don't you?

432
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,202
Well, I thought
I'd get more work

433
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:29,505
if I went down a cup size.

434
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:31,240
So I look like
a hanger. You know?

435
00:58:31,242 --> 00:58:33,742
But then
my surgeon, Dr. Andrew,

436
00:58:33,744 --> 00:58:35,784
he pointed out a lot of other
problems with my body.

437
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:38,647
So I had them shave my jaw,

438
00:58:38,649 --> 00:58:40,082
I had a slight eyebrow lift,

439
00:58:40,084 --> 00:58:43,652
new nose, cheeks,
inner and outer lipo,

440
00:58:43,654 --> 00:58:45,521
oh, and they pinned my ears.

441
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,690
Why?

442
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:51,193
So I could wear a ponytail.

443
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,564
Didn't it hurt?

444
00:58:55,566 --> 00:58:57,006
Anything worth having
hurts a little.

445
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:00,569
Besides, nobody likes
the way they look.

446
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:03,305
I do.

447
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:06,542
Are you Jesse?

448
00:59:06,544 --> 00:59:07,943
Mmm-hmm.

449
00:59:07,945 --> 00:59:09,912
They wanna see you.

450
00:59:09,914 --> 00:59:11,813
I already had my fitting.

451
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:12,848
I'm just the messenger.

452
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:34,102
You.

453
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,338
I've decided you're
gonna close the show.

454
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:37,299
"Pry through
the portage of the head..."

455
01:05:37,301 --> 01:05:39,534
Hi.
"Like a brass Cannon."

456
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:41,970
I want you to meet my friend.
This is Dean.

457
01:05:41,972 --> 01:05:43,405
Hi.

458
01:05:43,407 --> 01:05:45,440
Your name's bean?
No, Dean.

459
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:46,641
Dean?
Dean, yeah.

460
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:47,676
Dean, nice to meet you.

461
01:05:47,678 --> 01:05:49,678
Nice to meet you, too.

462
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,646
Well, come, join us.
Have a drink.

463
01:05:51,648 --> 01:05:53,648
Sit down.

464
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:55,010
I don't think there's
room for two.

465
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,286
That's all right, we can
just sit over there.

466
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:04,025
"Now set the teeth

467
01:06:04,027 --> 01:06:06,428
"and stretch the nostril wide,

468
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,698
"hold hard the breath

469
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:13,501
"and bend up every spirit
to his full height.

470
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:15,270
"On, on!"

471
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:21,142
And so on and so forth.

472
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:23,011
Wow!

473
01:06:23,013 --> 01:06:25,146
Did you always
wanna be an actor?

474
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:27,182
Well, performing always
came naturally to me

475
01:06:27,184 --> 01:06:29,217
because I'm a creator.

476
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:32,320
All right? I build, I make.
It's in my blood.

477
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:35,156
So whether I'm
designing a collection

478
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:37,158
or creating a character,

479
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,560
it's all the same, right?

480
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:42,364
I went out for a film last week.

481
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:43,665
Oh, yeah, how did it go?

482
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:46,401
They said my face
didn't match my voice.

483
01:06:46,403 --> 01:06:48,103
Well, you can fix your face.
No, don't do that.

484
01:06:48,105 --> 01:06:49,504
Why not?

485
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:52,307
Because you can always tell

486
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:54,209
when beauty is manufactured.

487
01:06:54,211 --> 01:06:57,078
And if you aren't born
beautiful, you never will be.

488
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,381
That's terrible.
No, it's true.

489
01:06:59,383 --> 01:07:00,703
I don't think you
can always tell.

490
01:07:02,718 --> 01:07:03,718
Dean,

491
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:07,055
we're having a little
debate over here,

492
01:07:07,057 --> 01:07:08,137
and we need your expertise.

493
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:10,325
Okay.

494
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,595
You know Gigi, right?

495
01:07:13,597 --> 01:07:16,498
Well, I mean, we just met.

496
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,366
Will you stand up so that
he can take a look at you?

497
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:19,368
Go on, stand up.

498
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:26,074
Well?

499
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:30,812
Well, what?

500
01:07:30,814 --> 01:07:32,734
What do you think? Do you
think she is beautiful?

501
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:35,517
I don't know, I mean...

502
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:39,187
Yeah, I guess she's fine.

503
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:41,056
Yes, yes.

504
01:07:41,058 --> 01:07:42,490
That's exactly the word
that I was looking for.

505
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:44,325
She's fine, right?

506
01:07:44,327 --> 01:07:45,487
You can sit down now, thanks.

507
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:48,430
Thank you, Dean.

508
01:07:48,432 --> 01:07:50,565
Now look at Jesse.

509
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:55,703
Nothing fake, nothing false.

510
01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:59,507
A diamond in a sea of glass.

511
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:06,548
True beauty is the highest
currency we have.

512
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:09,897
Now, without it,
she would be nothing.

513
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:14,155
I think you're wrong.

514
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:15,857
Excuse me.

515
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:18,326
I said, I think you're wrong.

516
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:22,363
So are you gonna tell me that

517
01:08:22,365 --> 01:08:24,732
it's what's inside that counts?

518
01:08:24,734 --> 01:08:26,134
Yeah, that's exactly
what I think.

519
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,271
Well, I think

520
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,408
that if she wasn't beautiful,

521
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,446
you wouldn't have
even stopped to look.

522
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:49,157
Beauty isn't everything.
It's the only thing.

523
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:59,367
Hey, let's get out of here.

524
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:01,636
I wanna go.

525
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:04,839
So go.

526
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:37,272
What are you doing here?

527
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:41,809
What are you?

528
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:47,582
Is that what you want?

529
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:51,619
You wanna be like them?

530
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:56,357
I don't wanna be them.

531
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:02,964
They wanna be me.

532
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:57,632
Wider.

533
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:12,013
Wider.

534
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:07,842
<i>- Hello?
- Ruby.</i>

535
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:13,060
<i>- Thank god you're awake.
- Jesse?</i>

536
01:17:13,062 --> 01:17:15,262
<i>I didn't know who to call.</i>

537
01:17:15,264 --> 01:17:16,264
<i>Are you okay?</i>

538
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,668
<i>It sounds like he's killing her.</i>

539
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:23,137
<i>What? Who is?</i>

540
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:24,338
<i>What do I do?</i>

541
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:27,074
<i>He already tried to get in.</i>

542
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:28,943
<i>Can you get out?</i>

543
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:33,247
<i>I think so.</i>

544
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:35,383
<i>Come here.</i>

545
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:38,219
<i>You're gonna be safe.</i>

546
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:57,805
I brought you some things.

547
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:02,002
Thanks.

548
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:06,774
You can wear this if you want.

549
01:19:06,776 --> 01:19:08,375
Unless you prefer
to sleep naked.

550
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:13,047
Are you going out?

551
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:15,883
I'm not going anywhere.

552
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:18,786
I'm going to stay here with you.

553
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:36,003
This house is amazing.

554
01:19:37,339 --> 01:19:38,499
How long have you lived here?

555
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:40,441
I don't live here.

556
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,792
But I thought you said
this was your house.

557
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:53,120
No, I said I'm
house-sitting.

558
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:56,490
Watering the plants.

559
01:19:57,993 --> 01:19:59,126
Checking the mail.

560
01:20:01,863 --> 01:20:04,131
Oh, well...

561
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:06,000
Do you think they'll
mind that I'm crashing?

562
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:13,040
You can stay here
for as long as you like.

563
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:24,451
Sit.

564
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:28,422
My mom used to brush my
hair after a bad day.

565
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:32,293
It's very soothing.

566
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:39,967
Ruby?

567
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:43,304
Just relax.

568
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:53,914
Ruby?

569
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:56,417
Mmm?

570
01:20:58,153 --> 01:20:59,153
Thank you.

571
01:21:01,223 --> 01:21:02,256
For what?

572
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:05,459
For being so good to me.

573
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:09,997
It's what friends are for.

574
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:16,637
No, I mean...

575
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:21,308
I think you're really wonderful.

576
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:30,584
I think you're just...

577
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:34,154
I think you are, too.

578
01:21:38,526 --> 01:21:41,495
I think you're so beautiful.

579
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:45,532
And you have
such beautiful skin.

580
01:21:45,534 --> 01:21:46,567
What are you doing?

581
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:55,355
I thought that's
what you wanted.

582
01:21:56,511 --> 01:21:57,511
No.

583
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:00,381
Oh.

584
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:12,593
It's not what you think.

585
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:18,365
Then what is it?

586
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:25,506
I lied before.

587
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:35,115
I've never been
with anyone like that.

588
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:50,998
I don't care.

589
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Ruby.

590
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:54,501
Ruby.

591
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:56,470
I don't care.

592
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:00,474
Stop.

593
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:02,309
Stop.
I want to.

594
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:04,044
I wanna be your first. Stop.

595
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:11,051
I said stop!

596
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:41,288
Jesse.

597
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:45,292
What are you doing?

598
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:58,138
You know what my mother
used to call me?

599
01:33:00,975 --> 01:33:01,975
Dangerous.

600
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:06,346
"You're a dangerous girl."

601
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:11,751
She was right.

602
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:15,088
I am dangerous.

603
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:18,692
I know what I look like.

604
01:33:20,728 --> 01:33:22,963
And what's wrong
with that anyway?

605
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,068
Women would kill
to look like this.

606
01:33:29,837 --> 01:33:32,072
They carve and stuff

607
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:35,709
and inject themselves.

608
01:33:37,745 --> 01:33:39,179
They starve to death,

609
01:33:40,348 --> 01:33:41,948
hoping,

610
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:45,986
praying that one
day they'll look

611
01:33:45,988 --> 01:33:47,921
like a second-rate
version of me.

612
01:34:11,012 --> 01:34:12,372
Are we having
a party or something?

613
01:42:22,136 --> 01:42:25,905
My girlfriend,
she hasn't worked in months.

614
01:42:25,907 --> 01:42:29,642
I mean, I keep telling her,
"girl, you need to retire."

615
01:42:29,644 --> 01:42:32,311
Right.

616
01:42:32,313 --> 01:42:34,680
Once you hit 21 in this
industry, you're so irrelevant.

617
01:42:34,682 --> 01:42:36,349
Try 20.

618
01:42:36,351 --> 01:42:38,584
True.
She won't listen.

619
01:42:38,586 --> 01:42:39,652
Of course she won't.

620
01:42:40,654 --> 01:42:42,188
No.

621
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:43,289
I mean, she's so desperate,

622
01:42:43,291 --> 01:42:45,925
the other day she went uptown,

623
01:42:45,927 --> 01:42:49,262
she was trying to buy this baby
seal fat from this random woman.

624
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:54,200
What, you think that's funny?

625
01:43:05,512 --> 01:43:06,646
No, I don't.

626
01:43:08,216 --> 01:43:10,316
You ever had a girl
screw you out of a job?

627
01:43:15,622 --> 01:43:16,622
Yes.

628
01:43:19,593 --> 01:43:21,360
So what did you do about it?

629
01:43:25,699 --> 01:43:26,933
I ate her.

630
01:43:28,268 --> 01:43:29,268
Ew!

631
01:43:30,404 --> 01:43:31,671
Gross.

632
01:44:32,432 --> 01:44:33,566
Do I know you?

633
01:44:39,473 --> 01:44:40,606
What are you doing here?

634
01:44:45,646 --> 01:44:47,346
I'm waiting for my friend.

635
01:44:50,884 --> 01:44:52,685
I'd like to use you for this.

636
01:44:54,621 --> 01:44:55,855
Would you be okay with that?

637
01:45:02,596 --> 01:45:04,597
Annie, you're fired!

638
01:45:07,868 --> 01:45:08,934
Thank you.

639
01:45:10,871 --> 01:45:12,505
Are you serious?

640
01:45:13,774 --> 01:45:15,708
It's not fair.

641
01:45:15,710 --> 01:45:16,976
You...
You can't fire me.

642
01:46:36,423 --> 01:46:37,423
Gigi.

643
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:41,660
Can you tell us
what's so interesting?

644
01:46:43,864 --> 01:46:44,997
You're staring in the pool.

645
01:46:47,033 --> 01:46:48,033
Look in the camera.

646
01:49:31,798 --> 01:49:33,566
I need to get her out of me.

647
01:49:34,734 --> 01:49:36,802
I need to get her out of me.
