00:00:36,777 --> 00:00:39,273
Hello guys, it's Friday, October 30.

5
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,310
And the next thing we are going to talk about
's 'Grave Encounters'.

6
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:43,267
Grave Encounters.
- Grave Encounters.

7
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,445
Grave Encounters.

8
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,946
It is a record found 'movie.

9
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:51,747
As Paranormal Activity, REC
or The Blair Witch Project.

10
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:56,279
They follow a bunch of ghost hunters, who
new reality TV show filming.

11
00:00:56,502 --> 00:00:59,913
That leads to an abandoned psychiatric hospital
in search of the unknown...

12
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,760
Ended much more realistic than they
expected.

13
00:01:02,983 --> 00:01:06,097
They met 'Grave Encounters'
- These effects are well done...

14
00:01:06,258 --> 00:01:09,330
The camera work is terrible.
- The only thing wrong with the film...

15
00:01:09,553 --> 00:01:13,165
it's a good movie, but not scary.

16
00:01:13,388 --> 00:01:17,212
He's fucking scary.
- He's terribly creepy.

17
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:20,424
You're looking at him and
it plays with your mind.

18
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:25,347
And there are quite scary in parts.
Faces of people who do so.

19
00:01:25,604 --> 00:01:27,343
You can not tell if this is real.

20
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:29,971
This is scary,
it's really scary.

21
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:33,979
This movie makes me so scared
I'm not here to lie...

22
00:01:34,036 --> 00:01:36,992
so much that I almost wet my pants did.

23
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,909
And the end
I must talk about the end...

24
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:44,735
end because this was one of the worst
end pieces of my life.

25
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:49,611
I think I have this movie
'Grave Encounters', lets skip.

26
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:51,829
a scale of four.

27
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:53,622
I think this was all for this week.

28
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,499
This Movie Madness by Alex.

29
00:01:57,756 --> 00:02:02,038
Log in to my channel
Alex_moviekid88.

30
00:02:02,295 --> 00:02:07,385
Thanks for watching and
a happy Halloween.

31
00:02:07,642 --> 00:02:11,037
Grave Encounters Part 2.

32
00:02:13,646 --> 00:02:15,405
Where are you going?
- Where you're not going.

33
00:02:15,406 --> 00:02:18,639
Lucky.
- Hey, remember me?

34
00:02:19,796 --> 00:02:21,716
Stay with me, motherfucker.

35
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:32,672
My god, that's another kiss, Tessa.
- Trevor, lazer on.

36
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,507
Are there not some freshmen there?
- I hope so.

37
00:02:35,564 --> 00:02:39,970
I know you do not like to eat a dick.
Come on, make an exception for me.

38
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,332
Are you okay?

39
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:52,811
Are you Michael from thriller.
Or are you dead Michael.

40
00:02:52,868 --> 00:02:57,438
I'm dead Michael, sweetie.
Where are the kids then?

41
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:03,323
Are you here filming
with this piece of shit?

42
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,248
My camera may be small but are
I have a huge throbbing penis.

43
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:11,049
Not like that little of you.

44
00:03:17,753 --> 00:03:21,673
What have we here?
My God.

45
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:25,270
Jennifer.
- Where's Alex?

46
00:03:25,327 --> 00:03:28,313
I do not know.
- Is he here? Did he come with you?

47
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,569
He's not with me.
- I was really hoping I would see him tonight.

48
00:03:32,826 --> 00:03:35,328
Want tongues? Okay.

49
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:39,350
I love the balance you.
You should now continue drinking.

50
00:03:40,112 --> 00:03:42,677
Knock on the doors.

51
00:03:49,176 --> 00:03:51,064
Do you really annoy me now?

52
00:03:54,398 --> 00:03:56,452
Learn  once to knock.
- Hey, man.

53
00:03:56,912 --> 00:03:57,742
Put the fucking camera down.

54
00:03:57,841 --> 00:04:00,941
There is a mega party here and
you're masturbating.

55
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:04,259
Take you kidding me?
Await real vaginas on you there.

56
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:06,636
And Jen wants your body friend.

57
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:11,432
Is Jennifer there?
- Like I said, she looks good.

58
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:15,391
Not as good as this, but...
very good.

59
00:04:15,614 --> 00:04:17,192
I have no costume, I can not go.
- Error.

60
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:21,148
You have a costume.
I have one won?

61
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:24,199
No, I do not.
I'm not wearing this fucking.

62
00:04:24,456 --> 00:04:26,277
Yes, you are, it's Halloween.
- I'm not wearing.

63
00:04:26,695 --> 00:04:28,671
No, absolutely not.

64
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:35,325
I can not believe I've persuaded me
.

65
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:38,494
Your ass is amazing.
- Look yet.

66
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:42,146
Cut it out. I'm not so among men.

67
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:47,042
friend Jack.
Do you listen.

68
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:50,636
There is no class in the horror movies.

69
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:55,131
No class, I tell you,
it comes to fast shooting and large lenses.

70
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:57,927
CGI needs to models to use.

71
00:04:58,184 --> 00:05:02,118
And makeup effects.
- I think you're right.

72
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,814
As earlier.

73
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:06,058
I agree with you.
- Carpenter, Craven...

74
00:05:06,315 --> 00:05:08,300
where are these guys in our generation?

75
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:12,671
Where are you?
This school death the new Gravens.

76
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:14,927
Nobody.
I'll tell you where they are.

77
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:16,985
They're here, friend.
Speech.

78
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:19,710
My name is Alex Wright.
You two are fucking...

79
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:22,367
genius, baby.

80
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:24,914
Alex's film revolves
ladies and gentlemen.

81
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:27,165
I will make a horror movie.

82
00:05:27,922 --> 00:05:31,043
I will rediscover the genre.
- Yeah, I guess.

83
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,205
You know it and I know it.
It will be artistic.

84
00:05:34,655 --> 00:05:38,877
a vision.
I will be a visionary, damn.

85
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:40,875
And I must say that kind of trouble.

86
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,285
Party on, fuckers.

87
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:57,535
That is delicious.
Sleeping Beauty.

88
00:06:04,492 --> 00:06:06,515
Wake up, bitch.

89
00:06:09,622 --> 00:06:13,116
How do you feel big boy?

90
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,327
Look, who's your friend?

91
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,109
my timeline but I would just check
if I were you.

92
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:22,609
Why?

93
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,353
There are some funny photos of you on.
From last night.

94
00:06:27,876 --> 00:06:31,583
What have you done?
Tell me what you did.

95
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,007
Keep watching and you'll see.

96
00:06:34,264 --> 00:06:37,178
You grab me at my breasts.

97
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:40,008
That was the problem,
why did you let me drink a whole bottle of tequila.

98
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:41,883
You grabbed it and wanted
not return.

99
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,424
Who is this man?

100
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:47,096
I have no idea.
Look.

101
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:50,399
Look, that's you.

102
00:06:50,656 --> 00:06:53,395
Why hell.
Why did you put that shit on there?

103
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:56,650
Take it away.
- No, I did not even getagt.

104
00:06:56,907 --> 00:06:58,776
are my balls.
- I do not care.

105
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:04,425
fucking a YouTube sensation.
It has 26 hits, my balls go virtual.

106
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:07,493
Take your fucking kidding me?
- Beautiful photo.

107
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,698
no fool who tries to help me?

108
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:13,832
You stood in full attention man.

109
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:16,689
You're almost a star.
- I'm my tag removal.

110
00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:18,186
I get my tag away.
Fuck.

111
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:22,440
Hello, do you know where I can find weed?
Or marijuana?

112
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:26,777
Hey friend, I'm looking for weed.

113
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,595
Okay. Dr. Sam.

114
00:07:34,856 --> 00:07:37,182
Good times at the film academy.

115
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:40,683
Right.
- What are you doing?

116
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,941
I check the news and opinions.
- You are such a nerd.

117
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:48,936
I do not care.
My opinion is given a name out there.

118
00:07:49,193 --> 00:07:52,276
Watch this only once.
I have a video response.

119
00:07:56,347 --> 00:07:59,787
guy who
"Grave Encounters" distributed.

120
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:18,549
I do not remember that scene in the movie
Sat

121
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:22,771
Who sent that video?

122
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:26,223
"Death Awaits"

123
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,016
The message is "Death Awaits"

124
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:31,419
Find out where the video comes from.
And the problem is resolved.

125
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:33,738
Can we please have some
tacos for dinner?

126
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:52,450
Gary, stop.
That's enough.

127
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:55,799
provoke not Stacey.
You find it fine.

128
00:08:58,456 --> 00:09:01,284
Gary.
Stop.

129
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:05,554
Dirty bitch.

130
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:10,500
Look. I know that tonight
exactly a year ago...

131
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:14,231
that your father disappeared, but
you must agree to live now.

132
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,156
That provocative bitch.

133
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:38,990
Hello? Who's there?

134
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,477
Who does this, it's not funny.

135
00:09:47,508 --> 00:09:51,735
Gary.
Where are you?

136
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,114
No. My god no.

137
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:06,678
I'm sorry.

138
00:10:07,534 --> 00:10:13,465
Okay, let's just go,
I'm cold.

139
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:15,437
Gary?

140
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:22,538
No.

141
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:26,898
And cut.
That was for Marty.

142
00:10:28,823 --> 00:10:32,697
We go straight through to the other shots, okay?
- That sounds good.

143
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:35,253
Jennifer  My God, you're officially
becoming the next...

144
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:36,865
queen of scream to be.
- Really?

145
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:38,625
Alex?
- Yes?

146
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:41,362
How could a man after his death
back on there?

147
00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:43,201
That makes no sense.

148
00:10:43,324 --> 00:10:46,202
This is a great start.
Believe me, I know what I'm doing.

149
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,060
I am a professional.
- Breasts.

150
00:10:48,117 --> 00:10:50,243
Trev. "Death Awaits" replied.

151
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,131
Yes, and what does he say?
- Look.

152
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:58,950
What is that?
Is it a phone?

153
00:10:59,444 --> 00:11:01,427
49.14.122.48.

154
00:11:01,684 --> 00:11:03,964
are too many numbers to
a phone to be.

155
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:08,379
Who is it? Who has sent you this?
- Alex has a stalker on YouTube.

156
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,863
It makes no sense.

157
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:12,943
I checked the website and
again with Google Maps.

158
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,362
logical, but I do not understand why he sent me to this
.

159
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:17,832
Wait, go back to the part where
you're talking about...

160
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:20,267
the length of the songs and stuff.

161
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:26,252
Okay, 49.14.122.48.
The message of "Death Awaits".

162
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,608
The numbers are latitude, longitude.
I think.

163
00:11:28,643 --> 00:11:32,609
Where do you think they mean?
- Vancouver Canada, the exact location...

164
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:35,369
a psychiatric institution called...

165
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:38,074
I think they see the movie Grave Encounters
have recorded.

166
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:42,020
They call the building
Collen Wood in the film.

167
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:45,796
'Collen Wood' does not exist, but
... it.

168
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:47,639
And that's the same bullshit
what we already had.

169
00:11:47,762 --> 00:11:50,251
It was built at the end of the century,
mad doctors, lobotomy.

170
00:11:50,507 --> 00:11:52,588
All that crap...
That's all real, it happened.

171
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:00,389
There it is.

172
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,874
Where the hell are you?

173
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,695
Male, Trevor check this out ..

174
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:14,295
Have you seen this? It scares me.
- Look you here for?

175
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:17,641
Many people believe that this is real
I'm not the only one.

176
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,384
They thought Blair Witch Project really was.

177
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:26,988
Yes, and Paranormal Activity and
stupid thing in space, on the moon.

178
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:28,830
It's just a marketing ploy, Alex.

179
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:31,142
That's exactly what they want you to think.
It's just a movie.

180
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:34,517
And, I mean it's not even a good movie.
I mean...

181
00:12:34,574 --> 00:12:36,093
look at the special effects.

182
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,622
No single actor in this movie has
something done, since the film was released.

183
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,791
Nothing. Can you explain that?
The caretaker's been dead eight years now.

184
00:12:44,048 --> 00:12:47,909
Kenny Sandoval, committed suicide in 2004...

185
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,613
shot himself with a shotgun.
The guy went crazy.

186
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,678
What about your own film, Alex?

187
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:57,154
do you a favor policeman who
for details to quickly settle?

188
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,201
Hello everyone. Actually, I have some questions...

189
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,690
where I need help,
to find answers...

190
00:13:03,947 --> 00:13:06,000
about a movie I saw last week,
Grave Encounters.

191
00:13:06,557 --> 00:13:08,200
I try to get in touch with the directors
...

192
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:10,235
or one of the actors or someone
that has to do...

193
00:13:10,492 --> 00:13:13,065
with the film.
But I can not find any information about them.

194
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:16,026
There's something about that movie that is not true
and I want to the bottom.

195
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:20,369
So, if you or someone you know knows how
may come into contact with them.

196
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,932
Please, leave a message.
I would really appreciate it.

197
00:13:49,148 --> 00:13:53,347
Help.
Help. Somebody help me.

198
00:13:56,947 --> 00:14:00,839
Please, why are you doing this to me?
Let me go.

199
00:14:00,996 --> 00:14:05,095
No, help!

200
00:14:10,123 --> 00:14:13,030
It's time for your appointment.
- No.

201
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:21,936
You fucking psycho.
- It seems that you have holes.

202
00:14:34,268 --> 00:14:36,464
What is that?

203
00:14:38,063 --> 00:14:42,865
No, please no.
- This may hurt a little.

204
00:14:43,122 --> 00:14:46,455
No, no.

205
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:53,024
Stop.
- What did you think?

206
00:14:53,281 --> 00:14:56,166
Did you like it?
- It was good.

207
00:14:56,947 --> 00:15:01,003
I just need some things to think about.
- You do not seem very happy with it.

208
00:15:02,716 --> 00:15:04,840
Is it my performance?
- No, it was not your bet.

209
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:07,690
I have several variants
of practice, so we can...

210
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:11,251
It's not your fault. Okay.
- What about your dick man?

211
00:15:11,307 --> 00:15:12,851
The pictures look great.

212
00:15:12,882 --> 00:15:15,251
It looks good I admit.
But it's so cliché.

213
00:15:15,508 --> 00:15:18,787
A masked man and a tied girl.
We have so often seen.

214
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,623
This is fucking torture porn, man.
Where people love.

215
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,209
You can earn $ 100 million.
- Yes, but I do not care.

216
00:15:24,832 --> 00:15:27,019
I do not know. I must again
quiet about it.

217
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:28,704
Everyone can go, I have to rewrite it.

218
00:15:30,311 --> 00:15:32,550
Okay, everybody, that's it for today.

219
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,574
Really?
- Great.

220
00:15:38,393 --> 00:15:42,767
Jen, it was really good.
It scared me.

221
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:44,532
Thank you.

222
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,294
So look more cheerful.
- Film me that.

223
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:52,033
Okay, so I just picked up my mail and...

224
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:56,677
And I have a message from the YouTube user who
lately sending messages.

225
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:58,653
Let's see what he has sent.

226
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,957
This is a picture of Sean Rogerson
when he was younger.

227
00:16:02,214 --> 00:16:04,824
The woman next to him should be his mother.

228
00:16:05,081 --> 00:16:08,116
It came from a phone,
it is a local number from Washington...

229
00:16:08,173 --> 00:16:10,704
so I will try.
Maybe it's about his mother.

230
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:12,504
Let's see where it goes.

231
00:16:12,661 --> 00:16:15,875
Hello?
- Hello, this is the house of Rogerson?

232
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:19,419
Yes.
- I'm looking for Sean, is he?

233
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:23,067
Why do you want to talk to Sean?
- I'm doing a thesis on...

234
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:27,917
a movie where he participated named
Grave Encounters. I'd like to interview.

235
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:33,271
It would really help if I'm not the only one who would have had to navigate
.

236
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:35,991
You do not have to.
The GPS helps you.

237
00:16:36,092 --> 00:16:39,692
Yes, many good friends do that...
- This is the white terminator error.

238
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:45,608
They do not help us. Computers are
not help us. It's in their nature.

239
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:48,843
must.
- We seem to be there.

240
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:54,078
Okay, so what was that girl again?
- Elijah, Trevor I say now for the 18th time.

241
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:56,973
And they said Sean certainly would be?

242
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:59,700
Sean would be here at three o'clock and willing
to do an interview.

243
00:16:59,957 --> 00:17:02,678
Let's do it.
- Easily said, let's go.

244
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:06,685
Wait,
I do it with a big lens filming.

245
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,256
I do not understand why you've brought your camera
.

246
00:17:09,513 --> 00:17:11,440
That's for my documentary
for the 15th time...

247
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,552
Your documentary adds nothing to it.

248
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:15,396
Your documentary adds nothing to it.

249
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,098
This is exactly where my documentary about.
- Shut up.

250
00:17:19,564 --> 00:17:21,259
Hello.
- Alex?

251
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:25,020
Yes, Alex and this is my friend Trevor.

252
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,932
Nice to meet you,
come inside before you catch cold.

253
00:17:29,189 --> 00:17:30,972
Yes, thank you.
- Absolutely.

254
00:17:31,195 --> 00:17:33,393
Guys, wait up.

255
00:17:35,452 --> 00:17:40,691
Would you like some tea or coffee?
I have a nice tea in the pot.

256
00:17:40,948 --> 00:17:42,836
I do nothing, thank you.

257
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:45,604
I do also nothing, not all of us, I think.
But thanks anyway.

258
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:49,616
What does the picture look like?
- Prima.

259
00:17:49,873 --> 00:17:52,583
Mrs. Rogerson, Sean is now in the neighborhood?

260
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,401
He just left, you just missed him.
But he comes back soon.

261
00:17:56,658 --> 00:18:00,151
Okay, but Sean lives?
He's okay?

262
00:18:00,408 --> 00:18:04,753
course, I always tease him,
that he is a workaholic.

263
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,804
He is currently working
a new TV series.

264
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:11,674
He loves acting, he always wanted
actor, even when he was little.

265
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,598
we wait for him
if you wish.

266
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:17,838
He will be glad to see you,
he loves it when people come to visit.

267
00:18:18,095 --> 00:18:23,640
Sean, lives here?
- His whole life al Yes.

268
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:27,276
Yes, of course, why wait
you not in his room?

269
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:29,922
That's what he liked.
It's up the stairs, and then right.

270
00:18:40,543 --> 00:18:44,365
Best Player 1996.

271
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:46,582
Look at this.

272
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:49,994
I think here a long time
nobody lives.

273
00:18:50,217 --> 00:18:52,247
That's him when he was younger.

274
00:18:52,504 --> 00:18:55,125
He looks like the "Real Slim Shady".

275
00:18:55,382 --> 00:18:56,977
That's a really bad haircut.

276
00:18:57,235 --> 00:18:58,795
He loved cats.

277
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:01,180
you?
- Yes, I...

278
00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:04,597
What are you doing here?

279
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:08,885
Sorry, but who are you?
- I'm the nurse Mrs. Rogerson.

280
00:19:09,142 --> 00:19:11,632
Mrs. Rogerson said we could wait
here.

281
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:14,749
We have an interview with Sean.
- You must go now.

282
00:19:14,972 --> 00:19:17,516
We were...
- You must go.

283
00:19:17,517 --> 00:19:18,917
You have to leave.

284
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,186
She said...
- Get out.

285
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,627
Get out, now.

286
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:24,108
We try to steal anything.
- This is ridiculous.

287
00:19:24,614 --> 00:19:26,317
She said we could wait.

288
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,354
We would just like to speak with Sean.

289
00:19:28,611 --> 00:19:33,261
Sean coming soon.
Soon as he is allowed to leave the hospital.

290
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:35,163
Which hospital do you mean?
What are you talking about?

291
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:36,989
hospital for crazy people.

292
00:19:37,212 --> 00:19:40,243
You know 'Grave Encounters'?
The TV series?

293
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,655
I helped you to find his name, Lance Preston.

294
00:19:45,912 --> 00:19:49,731
That was his stage name.
- Do not touch camera on.

295
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:52,386
Out.
- Okay, we're al

296
00:19:52,643 --> 00:19:54,571
more thing.
What happened to Sean?

297
00:19:54,572 --> 00:19:55,632
What happened to
the rest of his team?

298
00:19:55,855 --> 00:19:58,798
She invited us here.
We are her guests.

299
00:19:59,055 --> 00:20:01,134
We just want an interview with Sean.
That's all.

300
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:02,800
It is not intended that
they answer the phone.

301
00:20:03,023 --> 00:20:07,460
She suffers from dementia, and gets
from January full nursing.

302
00:20:12,616 --> 00:20:14,652
Did you hear that?

303
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:17,239
She knew 'Grave Encounters'

304
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:21,877
Look, she's nuts.
- Indeed.

305
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:26,739
hell.
She waves still.

306
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:29,288
Man, she makes him.
This should really see.

307
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:32,068
Yeah, man. She was angry after the play.

308
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:37,664
Alex, the point is, you said you would
would be there, but you were not there.

309
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:40,873
conditions showed the
... I know it sounds bad, but...

310
00:20:41,096 --> 00:20:43,523
It was also important for me.

311
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,171
I know, I'm sorry.
- You promised you'd be there.

312
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:48,472
And you were not.

313
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:50,806
I searched everywhere for you.
- I know.

314
00:20:51,061 --> 00:20:53,258
I'm sorry, but look at this.

315
00:20:53,515 --> 00:20:55,194
You're obsessed.
It's a movie.

316
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:57,351
It's not just one damn movie.
Listen to me.

317
00:20:57,352 --> 00:21:01,809
Call the mayor of Vancouver.
They have a file on March 28.

318
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:04,432
I do not care.
- 2003.

319
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:06,984
I do not care.
- Okay, then.

320
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:11,323
know, I'm so damn movie Sat
Do what you want.

321
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,493
You do not worry about me
more to do.

322
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,864
Day Jenn.
- Fuck you, Trevor.

323
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,085
Not now.

324
00:21:23,002 --> 00:21:24,816
What was her problem?

325
00:21:26,673 --> 00:21:28,745
I feel bad about the play...

326
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:31,039
but what can I say?
This is important.

327
00:21:33,638 --> 00:21:35,584
What?
You're not with me?

328
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:41,297
I mean, I'm telling you,
from friend to friend, okay.

329
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,309
Jenn is probably the only
girl on this campus...

330
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,598
with the greatest chance
that you do your penis can stabbing.

331
00:21:47,732 --> 00:21:51,181
Yes, that's true.

332
00:21:52,471 --> 00:21:55,141
And now this has been said.
If I were you...

333
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,101
I would drop the conspiracy theory.

334
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,810
Conspiracy Theory?

335
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:03,106
Dude, I love you, but...
- Look at the evidence.

336
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:06,365
Missing, missing team.
Possible death.

337
00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:08,529
What do I need to prove?

338
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,027
See what I mean?

339
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,536
every day I wake up next to "Rainman".

340
00:22:12,793 --> 00:22:15,956
Fuck, Rainman was a genius.

341
00:22:19,465 --> 00:22:22,287
Hello everyone, I know it's been a while
ago, I've posted some...

342
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:27,999
but there are many strange things happened,
during our research and recordings.

343
00:22:28,256 --> 00:22:31,002
I did an interview with the mother
Sean Rogerson.

344
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:34,512
Listen to me, 'Grave Encounters' is real.

345
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:37,070
My friends do not believe me.
And I myself probably not.

346
00:22:37,327 --> 00:22:39,594
But I'm not crazy.
I've done my research.

347
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:43,187
I just need proof.

348
00:22:43,443 --> 00:22:46,029
Maybe we should go back to Takoma,
and read some more articles.

349
00:22:46,286 --> 00:22:48,343
more...

350
00:23:00,663 --> 00:23:03,531
The printer is automatically entered
and starts printing...

351
00:23:03,774 --> 00:23:06,650
without anything I've done.

352
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:13,799
2384 Melrose Ave Los Angeles.

353
00:23:14,056 --> 00:23:18,313
It looks like a kind of data sheet,
to create a video clip...

354
00:23:18,511 --> 00:23:21,550
that held tomorrow in LA.
Hartsfield Productions.

355
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:24,311
Where do I know that name from?

356
00:23:24,568 --> 00:23:27,177
Jerry Hartfield, he was producer of
'Grave Encounters'

357
00:23:27,434 --> 00:23:30,009
data sheet that is printed...

358
00:23:30,265 --> 00:23:32,475
for a video, he
tomorrow recording.

359
00:23:32,732 --> 00:23:34,810
You can not just go to LA for two days.

360
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:38,890
And our movie?
- This is important to me.

361
00:23:39,147 --> 00:23:43,065
you really fly all the way to LA,
for a data sheet?

362
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:46,895
Come on, I'm only two days away.
I see the problem.

363
00:23:47,152 --> 00:23:48,702
Do what you want.

364
00:24:02,382 --> 00:24:07,043
movie now outside the car,
and we are in LA.

365
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:12,206
Hollywood.
The film Mecca on Earth.

366
00:24:12,462 --> 00:24:15,600
I would not say that it is beautiful,
because there is a lot of smog, but...

367
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:20,887
We are now in the studio.

368
00:24:21,144 --> 00:24:23,466
Hi, Hartfield Productions?

369
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:27,560
Your name?
- Roberto Smith. I have this...

370
00:24:28,317 --> 00:24:31,641
I got this info for my
appointment today.

371
00:24:31,898 --> 00:24:33,266
a video clip.

372
00:24:33,488 --> 00:24:37,852
Okay, Roberto, but within a row,
and park on level C.

373
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,500
Thank you.
- Okay ..

374
00:24:53,462 --> 00:24:57,434
Film Crew.

375
00:25:10,517 --> 00:25:13,567
That's him, that's Jerry Hartfield.

376
00:25:15,729 --> 00:25:17,598
Cut.

377
00:25:17,855 --> 00:25:20,970
Guys, where's the confetti?
We run two hours behind schedule, ahead.

378
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:22,596
again.

379
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:25,893
I head toward Jerry,
and try to talk to him.

380
00:25:28,915 --> 00:25:30,659
Excuse me, sir Hartsfield?

381
00:25:30,823 --> 00:25:33,270
Can I talk to you?
- One second.

382
00:25:33,527 --> 00:25:38,031
Who are you?
- Alex Wright, I film a documentary.

383
00:25:38,088 --> 00:25:39,485
I was wondering if you wanted to give
an interview?

384
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:40,900
You find yourself on my set.

385
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,750
You can stop, because I give
no damn interview.

386
00:25:43,807 --> 00:25:47,122
Security, this man does not belong here.

387
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,559
I know of "Grave Encounters".
I know what you did.

388
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:52,426
Take him away.
- I know what you did.

389
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:57,205
I just tried to
with Jerry Hartsfield talking.

390
00:25:57,462 --> 00:26:01,894
He left the security put me out.
He obviously hiding something.

391
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:07,647
I know not what I can do
more.

392
00:26:13,482 --> 00:26:14,977
Yes?

393
00:26:15,234 --> 00:26:19,390
I will talk to you.
But not here, not for a camera.

394
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:23,200
Come tomorrow at two o'clock
to my office.

395
00:26:23,774 --> 00:26:26,296
Okay, fine, thank you.

396
00:26:31,898 --> 00:26:33,700
Success.

397
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,533
Test 1, 2, 3.

398
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:43,000
This will be a good shot.

399
00:26:49,052 --> 00:26:51,395
Hartfield Productions.
How can I help?

400
00:26:51,396 --> 00:26:53,199
I have an appointment with Jerry,
at 14:00.

401
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,118
Alex?
- That's right.

402
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:57,556
Register.

403
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:03,523
How do you know?
Tell me honestly.

404
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,768
I know 'Grave Encounters'
was real.

405
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:10,262
And Sean Rogerson
and the rest of the team is dead.

406
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:11,642
For the record...

407
00:27:11,737 --> 00:27:13,961
unless your body is found,
you are legally not dead...

408
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:16,941
but a missing person.
Thank God.

409
00:27:17,198 --> 00:27:20,903
So you admit it, the images are real.
- Yes, every frame is real.

410
00:27:20,904 --> 00:27:22,169
some cheap visual effects after...

411
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:23,981
we at the last moment
added.

412
00:27:23,982 --> 00:27:26,678
What about the families?

413
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:29,494
There is something called
a "confidentiality agreement".

414
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:31,396
Do you have a confidentiality agreement signed
?

415
00:27:31,452 --> 00:27:35,907
course, and arrange for some extra money, they signed
only too happy.

416
00:27:36,164 --> 00:27:39,073
You probably think I
a big asshole, right?

417
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,205
I can not understand why you did it.

418
00:27:42,462 --> 00:27:44,053
When I
images for the first time saw...

419
00:27:44,054 --> 00:27:45,456
scared me to death.

420
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,469
Do you understand that?
I wanted to destroy them first.

421
00:27:49,726 --> 00:27:52,054
But after all settlements
I sat on the edge of bankruptcy.

422
00:27:52,055 --> 00:27:54,606
So, then I got an idea.

423
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:58,281
Why not release it as a movie?
Maybe we can recoup the cost?

424
00:27:58,538 --> 00:28:00,857
And it worked, because they want a sequel.

425
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:03,620
'Grave Encounters 2'
Can you believe that?

426
00:28:03,621 --> 00:28:06,222
directors The Vicious Brothers.
Who are they?

427
00:28:08,445 --> 00:28:11,000
Why do not you join me?

428
00:28:13,494 --> 00:28:15,317
Meet The Vicious Brothers.

429
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:17,728
Day, Jerry.

430
00:28:17,985 --> 00:28:20,570
This is Colin.
And that is Stuart.

431
00:28:20,827 --> 00:28:22,577
are my interns.

432
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,135
I pretended
the directors of the film were.

433
00:28:25,415 --> 00:28:27,784
They arrange everything with the press, and because they are not union
sit...

434
00:28:27,976 --> 00:28:30,100
I do not have to pay them.

435
00:28:31,048 --> 00:28:34,795
You get all the students from UCLA.

436
00:28:35,052 --> 00:28:38,671
And those of USC, and they are extremely rude.
Now you know the truth.

437
00:28:38,672 --> 00:28:41,085
You can not get away.
- We already done.

438
00:28:41,342 --> 00:28:42,682
I will tell to everyone.

439
00:28:42,739 --> 00:28:45,469
Go ahead, who will listen to you?
You're a nobody.

440
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,110
The only reason I agreed
went with this conversation...

441
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,021
was to see whether you
evidence against me.

442
00:28:49,022 --> 00:28:52,260
What you did not.
- I guess we'll see.

443
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:54,945
We shall then see.
You may go now.

444
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:58,770
What an asshole.

445
00:28:59,027 --> 00:29:01,433
Who will listen to you?
You're a nobody.

446
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,318
So that's why I had to go.

447
00:29:04,575 --> 00:29:07,703
If this is true, then it is disturbed.
- I did not ask.

448
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,406
What an asshole.

449
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:14,762
Yes, but he is also right. Because nobody
will believe us, we need proof.

450
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:17,120
What do you mean by "evidence"?

451
00:29:17,377 --> 00:29:19,323
I've been thinking about...

452
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,491
and this is the movie I want to make.

453
00:29:21,748 --> 00:29:24,960
Think about it, we are
already well under way.

454
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:28,038
You have it all filmed with your phone.

455
00:29:28,295 --> 00:29:29,339
And you've also filmed.

456
00:29:29,488 --> 00:29:32,857
It's a documentary, but also
a horror movie, right?

457
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:35,051
Why is it a horror movie?

458
00:29:35,052 --> 00:29:36,837
I received a new message from
"Death Awaits".

459
00:29:37,094 --> 00:29:39,206
He lives in Canada, next to the hospital...

460
00:29:39,207 --> 00:29:40,820
Grave Encounters where they have filmed.

461
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:45,075
why he knows so much from,
and he wants us into the building meet.

462
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:48,899
There we find our evidence.
- You want to drive to Canada?

463
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,094
It is a 2 hour drive, we take
Jerry and Tessa with...

464
00:29:52,095 --> 00:29:53,940
and filming everything.

465
00:29:54,697 --> 00:29:57,747
It's a fucking movie, man.
For the 15th time...

466
00:29:57,748 --> 00:30:00,429
I do not drive all the way to Canada
for a crazy idea.

467
00:30:00,586 --> 00:30:02,273
I'll go.
- Seriously?

468
00:30:02,495 --> 00:30:04,324
Can you explain this?

469
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:06,904
No, but...
- Why did he do that?

470
00:30:07,161 --> 00:30:08,849
I do not know.

471
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:10,614
Are you in?
You go anyway, right?

472
00:30:10,615 --> 00:30:12,706
photography credit.

473
00:30:12,962 --> 00:30:14,649
You're in?
- Yes, let's do this.

474
00:30:14,706 --> 00:30:17,041
You're my producer,
I need you there.

475
00:30:17,298 --> 00:30:20,755
You can go to Sundance with this material.
This will put us on the map.

476
00:30:20,756 --> 00:30:22,762
Trust me.

477
00:30:25,288 --> 00:30:27,236
Okay.

478
00:30:29,683 --> 00:30:33,096
December 3, 2011

479
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:42,056
You should give us another time about what
'Grave Encounters' tell.

480
00:30:42,313 --> 00:30:47,313
We are on the way to... hospital.

481
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,727
We're here, right?

482
00:30:49,984 --> 00:30:52,107
How do you know?
- Take it.

483
00:30:58,248 --> 00:31:03,170
Is it illegal to
marijuana across the border to bring?

484
00:31:03,427 --> 00:31:04,716
That is definitely illegal.

485
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:07,708
I thought Canada had
tolerance?

486
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:11,700
you kidding?
- Alex go to the side, we have to dump something.

487
00:31:16,761 --> 00:31:19,876
You like to be.
I see it in your eyes.

488
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:22,560
Do you know the way to... hospital?

489
00:31:25,935 --> 00:31:29,860
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Vancouver.

490
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:34,812
The forest is closed.

491
00:31:35,069 --> 00:31:38,432
I shall open.
- She's going to open.

492
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,624
That is a tough bitch.

493
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:50,573
You're kidding.
- See this?

494
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:54,485
Alex, they have certainly managed
a creepy building to building.

495
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:56,704
Jesus Christ, this place is huge.

496
00:31:56,961 --> 00:32:00,200
Alex, you know exactly where they
have filmed?

497
00:32:00,457 --> 00:32:04,400
I think it was here,
let's take a look.

498
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,907
the Canadian police.

499
00:32:14,864 --> 00:32:19,006
Seriously?
- Guys, let me do the talking.

500
00:32:19,263 --> 00:32:21,600
Say nothing.

501
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:28,562
Excuse me, this is private property
Did you see the sign?

502
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:31,600
Sorry.
- Hello, sorry. We are film students.

503
00:32:31,857 --> 00:32:34,475
We just want a few shots
for our school.

504
00:32:34,698 --> 00:32:37,436
We just want to make some images
from the outside, that's all.

505
00:32:37,693 --> 00:32:39,272
Sorry, but this
buildings are full of asbestos.

506
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:41,368
That is very dangerous.
You gotta get outta here.

507
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:44,784
Turn the camera off.
- No, absolutely not.

508
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:47,403
You may not filming.
You can not film in this area.

509
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,737
I understand.
We al

510
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,990
Give me the tape.
- I do not care.

511
00:32:51,247 --> 00:32:54,463
Give the tapes from the cameras.
Specify the tape.

512
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,864
Damn.
- Keep driving, Alex.

513
00:33:06,165 --> 00:33:08,465
Keep driving.
- What was that guy?

514
00:33:08,766 --> 00:33:10,066
What an asshole.

515
00:33:10,085 --> 00:33:13,840
Why would an agent do?
- I do not know.

516
00:33:14,097 --> 00:33:15,548
Would he be a kind of guard?

517
00:33:18,271 --> 00:33:19,676
What are you doing?

518
00:33:19,899 --> 00:33:21,619
We are thrown,
on our first day.

519
00:33:22,613 --> 00:33:25,158
Here it is.

520
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:31,094
We just try to make recordings,
the outside of the hospital.

521
00:33:31,352 --> 00:33:33,359
But we were attacked
by a guard.

522
00:33:33,616 --> 00:33:37,318
That our cameras trying to tackle.
He said because "asbestos".

523
00:33:39,249 --> 00:33:42,071
That was clearly lied.
They try to hide the truth.

524
00:33:42,328 --> 00:33:43,612
They're trying to hide something.

525
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:46,323
They do not want anyone...

526
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,637
We are unstoppable.
- Fuck the police.

527
00:33:50,794 --> 00:33:53,000
Enough, guys.

528
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,169
This movie is retarded.

529
00:33:58,427 --> 00:34:00,751
This is why you are here?
Julie think this is real?

530
00:34:01,008 --> 00:34:04,178
That's what it's all about, Tessa.

531
00:34:04,435 --> 00:34:06,222
I am not responsible for my actions.

532
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:08,100
I received a new message
of 'Dead Awaits'.

533
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:13,675
It says that we meet him in the room
in the western tunnel, at 03:00 tonight.

534
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,365
We...

535
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:21,359
8 cameras with night vision,
we go draw around the building.

536
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:25,523
This mega camera with high resolution.

537
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,800
A thermal camera.
And an EMF meter.

538
00:34:32,082 --> 00:34:33,527
That's what she said.

539
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,177
Tonight we will try to find evidence...

540
00:34:37,434 --> 00:34:40,790
what Jerry Hartsfield 10 years
trying to hide.

541
00:34:41,047 --> 00:34:46,304
But this film, really.
The spiritual world exists.

542
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:49,998
And the team of 'Grave Encounters' died
during an attempt to capture.

543
00:35:06,443 --> 00:35:08,151
Here we go.
- Let's do this.

544
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:13,654
Damn, it's the guard.

545
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,365
Duck.

546
00:35:15,992 --> 00:35:18,000
Jerry, turn off the lights.
- Turn off the light.

547
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,326
Is someone there?

548
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,738
Duck.

549
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:31,039
Hello?

550
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,259
Okay, I'm on my way.

551
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,860
Okay, go.
- You heard it, now run.

552
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:49,405
Do something softer.

553
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:56,783
Wait for me.
- Do not leave me, all those ghosts here.

554
00:35:59,183 --> 00:36:01,513
"Death Awaits".
- "Death Awaits".

555
00:36:01,736 --> 00:36:05,458
It's definitely the right building.
Tess, bolt cutter.

556
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:10,712
No, I'm doing this.
- Whatever you want.

557
00:36:20,823 --> 00:36:24,438
you serious?
- My God.

558
00:36:26,828 --> 00:36:28,375
This place is not scary.

559
00:36:32,258 --> 00:36:33,796
My God, is that police tape?

560
00:36:34,053 --> 00:36:36,533
Why would the police come here
but if this was a movie?

561
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,960
Because this is not just a movie.

562
00:36:41,017 --> 00:36:44,005
Are you ready?
This hall scares me.

563
00:36:44,228 --> 00:36:48,783
Yeah, I'm so ready.
Okay.

564
00:36:50,899 --> 00:36:54,582
Okay, it's okay.
- Okay, let's go.

565
00:36:57,739 --> 00:36:59,785
<i> Camera 1: Ground floor, East Hall </ i>

566
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,487
That way.
- That side? okay.

567
00:37:08,914 --> 00:37:11,860
Demons in the corridor,
demons in my head.

568
00:37:12,117 --> 00:37:13,261
Demons...

569
00:37:13,284 --> 00:37:15,537
Okay, let's go.
We go.

570
00:37:16,993 --> 00:37:18,537
Okay, let's go.

571
00:37:18,953 --> 00:37:20,570
<i> Camera 2: Third floor
patient room. </ I>

572
00:37:20,627 --> 00:37:22,805
hurry.
- Wait for me.

573
00:37:29,204 --> 00:37:31,700
Hey, this is where the black die?

574
00:37:31,957 --> 00:37:36,557
Yeah, well the ethnic always go first death.

575
00:37:37,796 --> 00:37:39,954
<i> Camera 5: Third floor, bathroom </ i>

576
00:37:42,711 --> 00:37:46,958
Damn man, that's really high.

577
00:37:47,215 --> 00:37:49,081
Come on, man. Let's go.

578
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:52,135
Soon you fall into it.

579
00:37:52,392 --> 00:37:53,778
Okay, guys, we're going to make the intro.

580
00:37:53,835 --> 00:37:55,857
<i> Camera 7: Fourth floor, Window Room </ i>

581
00:38:08,924 --> 00:38:11,943
<i> Room 8: Sub-Level, Tunnels </ i>

582
00:38:13,912 --> 00:38:14,956
I can not say.
- Yes, you can.

583
00:38:15,144 --> 00:38:17,693
Alex are crazy documentary,
Take One.

584
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,995
Ready?

585
00:38:20,252 --> 00:38:22,580
It was on March 20, 2002.

586
00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:25,128
Sean Rogerson and a team
of 'Grave Encounters'...

587
00:38:25,385 --> 00:38:28,578
filmed their
sixth episode of a reality series.

588
00:38:28,835 --> 00:38:32,130
in the same building.

589
00:38:32,386 --> 00:38:37,417
They found something terrible, something that
their lives tragically inkorte.

590
00:38:37,517 --> 00:38:42,563
It was sold to the American public
as fiction, but it was actually...

591
00:38:42,564 --> 00:38:46,286
reality.

592
00:38:46,485 --> 00:38:49,055
Later tonight we will meet
an anonymous source...

593
00:38:49,155 --> 00:38:51,724
known only as "Death Awaits".

594
00:38:51,824 --> 00:38:53,559
He was the one who tipped us.

595
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:57,046
And in the meantime we will
our paranormal research.

596
00:38:57,146 --> 00:39:02,348
Hoping to uncover the truth
after a decade of concealment.

597
00:39:04,504 --> 00:39:07,131
Is everybody ready?
- Yes.

598
00:39:07,132 --> 00:39:08,450
Tess did you?
- Yes.

599
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:13,472
And 3, 2, 1... Action.

600
00:39:13,473 --> 00:39:17,893
This building is huge
and is super easy to get lost.

601
00:39:17,894 --> 00:39:19,922
So
to ensure that this does not happen...

602
00:39:20,022 --> 00:39:25,089
and we always find our way back,
let this glow-sticks fall behind us.

603
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:30,033
We have these military GPS.

604
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:33,897
That we bought in a spy shop,
in case...

605
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:39,083
one of us, the group lost.
Are we all this.

606
00:39:39,084 --> 00:39:41,403
Damn, blondie. I have headphones on.

607
00:39:41,503 --> 00:39:44,698
Sorry, I think it's safe to say...

608
00:39:44,798 --> 00:39:49,899
that we are well prepared for the worst.

609
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:58,815
This is the bath, where T. C Gibson...

610
00:39:58,816 --> 00:40:02,304
aka actor Merwin Mondesir, was slain.

611
00:40:02,404 --> 00:40:05,189
Now we try to communicate with the spirit world
.

612
00:40:05,289 --> 00:40:07,266
In the hope that we can achieve Merwin.

613
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:10,619
I take it, on my recorder.

614
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:15,317
the spirit of Merwin Mondesir here with us,
speak freely.

615
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:19,227
Do not worry, I'm sure your wife and your daughter
like something you want to hear.

616
00:40:21,728 --> 00:40:26,901
the spirit of Merwin Mondesir here with us,
speak freely.

617
00:40:27,001 --> 00:40:32,824
Do not worry, I'm sure your wife and your daughter
like something you want to hear.

618
00:40:36,498 --> 00:40:38,870
Great.
- Fuck.

619
00:40:39,193 --> 00:40:43,097
If there are ghosts here with us
speak freely.

620
00:40:43,197 --> 00:40:46,102
Give us a sign, make some noise.

621
00:40:46,202 --> 00:40:49,538
Create a cold place.

622
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:52,551
Jack, grab the thermal camera.
- Yes.

623
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:57,141
Okay, yeah.

624
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:04,414
Man... what the hell?

625
00:41:04,514 --> 00:41:10,563
There is a strange haze behind Trevor.
- You mean... let me see.

626
00:41:11,064 --> 00:41:14,357
I told you this was real.
- What is it?

627
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:17,507
Let no farting, asshole.

628
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:21,108
Is it visible on the thermal camera?
- Yes.

629
00:41:21,658 --> 00:41:24,714
Look again.
- Trevor.

630
00:41:26,538 --> 00:41:28,981
You did it, you're a beast.

631
00:41:29,082 --> 00:41:31,015
That's really mature.
- This is insane.

632
00:41:31,216 --> 00:41:33,916
So, what do you think?

633
00:41:35,256 --> 00:41:39,453
This is the tunnel where Sean Rogerson
his last moments in life were spent.

634
00:41:39,553 --> 00:41:41,972
Crazy become pain...

635
00:41:41,973 --> 00:41:46,127
of hunger,
as you get deeper into the tunnels running...

636
00:41:46,227 --> 00:41:50,465
is like you deeper and deeper into the depths of madness
comes.

637
00:41:50,565 --> 00:41:55,511
Taken literally, the tension
in this building, at every step.

638
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:58,392
What?
- I think it's a bit exaggerated.

639
00:41:58,692 --> 00:42:01,796
What is it exaggerated?
- You should not exaggerate too much about madness.

640
00:42:02,497 --> 00:42:04,697
I get it.

641
00:42:05,457 --> 00:42:07,150
Guys, look.

642
00:42:07,751 --> 00:42:10,295
Jack, take this on.
- Yeah, man.

643
00:42:10,296 --> 00:42:14,492
Seriously, what does this. Why do they do
on the ground?. It's disgusting.

644
00:42:14,592 --> 00:42:17,620
He said we had to meet in
the room, west of the tunnel.

645
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,218
And it does not go further west than this.

646
00:42:22,468 --> 00:42:25,838
What time is it?
- 03:25.

647
00:42:26,939 --> 00:42:28,695
Maybe he's just a little later.

648
00:42:28,795 --> 00:42:30,951
He's just not
without him we have nothing.

649
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:35,460
The whole project will be a disaster.

650
00:42:39,161 --> 00:42:42,982
What's this?
- No, this is a spirit board.

651
00:42:43,082 --> 00:42:45,527
A what?
- You lay your hand on a piece...

652
00:42:45,627 --> 00:42:48,490
and then try your spirits to communicate
using the letters.

653
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:52,909
Come on, we have to play.
- This will never work.

654
00:42:53,009 --> 00:42:55,704
Yes, yes.
We do the two of us.

655
00:42:55,804 --> 00:42:58,291
I talk to the spirits of...

656
00:42:58,391 --> 00:43:03,629
we know that many of you here
were mistreated and abused...

657
00:43:03,729 --> 00:43:08,067
and so therefore angry
in the afterlife.

658
00:43:08,068 --> 00:43:10,908
Are there ghosts here with us now?

659
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,909
It's not really...

660
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:21,147
Do you think
- No, do you?

661
00:43:22,321 --> 00:43:25,622
Who does it?
- I do not.

662
00:43:26,123 --> 00:43:27,823
Sit me not to besodemieteren.
- I do not.

663
00:43:27,923 --> 00:43:32,579
I do not.
- Okay, who are we talking about?

664
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:34,290
Give me a name?

665
00:43:35,891 --> 00:43:39,046
My God boys.
- Okay, stop.

666
00:43:39,346 --> 00:43:42,356
D. .. E. ..

667
00:43:43,257 --> 00:43:47,028
A. .. T. .. H. ..

668
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:52,492
A. .. W. .. A. .. I. .. T. .. S

669
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,270
Damn. "Death Awaits"
is not a person.

670
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:58,831
this State on YouTube guys?
- This is really weird.

671
00:43:58,832 --> 00:44:00,680
What do you want us to do?

672
00:44:07,091 --> 00:44:09,859
My God, what he says.

673
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:14,584
Take everything.

674
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:18,448
Take everything.
- Yes, of course.

675
00:44:18,855 --> 00:44:21,441
Damn, all backwards.

676
00:44:21,442 --> 00:44:23,674
Guys seriously, this is not a joke.

677
00:44:25,075 --> 00:44:26,475
Are you okay?

678
00:44:36,626 --> 00:44:38,599
What the hell happened?

679
00:44:47,845 --> 00:44:50,081
Got anything filmed?
- Yeah, I got it.

680
00:44:50,181 --> 00:44:52,225
Alex, I can not fucking believe it.

681
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:54,590
Okay, what was that?
- What is it?

682
00:44:57,691 --> 00:45:00,776
Great.
- I told you to keep your mouth.

683
00:45:01,277 --> 00:45:02,877
What the hell was that?

684
00:45:07,212 --> 00:45:10,980
not move. Okay. It's good.

685
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,233
you realize that breaking
a criminal offense?

686
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:15,514
you think I would not see that broken lock?

687
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:18,195
I understand,
but I'm not leaving without my stuff.

688
00:45:18,295 --> 00:45:19,946
It is not even mine, it's
of our school.

689
00:45:19,966 --> 00:45:23,387
I do not care who it is?
That you discuss it with the police.

690
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:25,597
God, do not be a jerk.

691
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:30,226
Shut up.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

692
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,022
He's not.
- You're not a cop

693
00:45:33,023 --> 00:45:34,356
Trevor, shut up.

694
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:37,692
Thank you, now listen to your friend.

695
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,736
Sir, you do not...

696
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:43,315
Damn?
- What the hell was that.

697
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,783
Okay, who's there?

698
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,747
Nobody.
- Nonsense. Who else is here?

699
00:45:48,748 --> 00:45:51,875
There's nobody else here.
- Something strange is happening this building.

700
00:45:51,876 --> 00:45:54,269
And I do not know what it is...
- What are you talking about?

701
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:56,490
I do not know.
- This place is haunted, man.

702
00:45:56,491 --> 00:45:58,925
Do me a favor?
Okay, now you all...

703
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:03,221
stay here and do not move.

704
00:46:03,222 --> 00:46:07,259
You really should not go up.
- Weapon there and act tough.

705
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,768
Do you want him now?
Shut up and stay here.

706
00:46:17,405 --> 00:46:20,157
Let's get out of here, man.
- No, we can not leave...

707
00:46:20,158 --> 00:46:22,743
If we go now...
- Yeah, come on.

708
00:46:22,744 --> 00:46:24,620
If I go, I leave behind...

709
00:46:24,621 --> 00:46:26,497
the stuff of the University,
$ 50,000 to cameras.

710
00:46:26,498 --> 00:46:28,332
If you stay, you will be arrested.

711
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:32,879
If you want to leave, go ahead.
I stay, if I do not have the camera and recording...

712
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,464
I have no movie?

713
00:46:34,465 --> 00:46:36,236
Then I fucking movie.

714
00:46:39,137 --> 00:46:41,437
Were those gunshots?
- Yes, that was it.

715
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:44,142
No, Alex stay here.

716
00:46:44,143 --> 00:46:46,728
Man, let's go.
- Where are you going?

717
00:46:46,729 --> 00:46:49,581
He can hurt.
- He's an asshole.

718
00:46:49,582 --> 00:46:51,405
Come on!

719
00:46:56,498 --> 00:46:59,541
Hello?
Are you here?

720
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:18,502
Are you okay?

721
00:47:22,518 --> 00:47:27,522
're kidding.
- We gotta go.

722
00:47:27,523 --> 00:47:30,262
I agree with her,
we gotta get outta here.

723
00:47:30,863 --> 00:47:34,073
Wait, we make two groups,
then it goes faster.

724
00:47:34,074 --> 00:47:35,616
you serious?
This is stupid, Alex.

725
00:47:35,617 --> 00:47:37,952
Why the hell should we split?
- Just go fast.

726
00:47:37,953 --> 00:47:39,787
Tes, as we all do,
takes longer.

727
00:47:39,788 --> 00:47:44,793
Fuck you, I will not walk alone.
- Pull yourself. Go Tes.

728
00:47:44,794 --> 00:47:47,462
the camera.
- Are you crazy?

729
00:47:47,463 --> 00:47:51,550
Why are you against it every time?
Why do not we just.

730
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,847
So incredibly stupid,
I do not think we do now.

731
00:47:54,848 --> 00:47:56,785
Can you keep that flashlight there.

732
00:47:58,986 --> 00:48:00,974
Can you please hurry up?

733
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:12,376
Shoot.
- Take it easy.

734
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:18,522
Tessa, I found the room.

735
00:48:19,123 --> 00:48:23,086
Where are you?
- At the end of the corridor.

736
00:48:23,087 --> 00:48:24,877
Where?

737
00:48:33,223 --> 00:48:37,195
Damn.

738
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:49,128
Tessa, come here.

739
00:48:52,913 --> 00:48:57,260
What are you doing?

740
00:49:01,461 --> 00:49:05,560
Jerry, where are you?

741
00:49:05,967 --> 00:49:07,668
My God, Jerry.

742
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:16,727
Guys, I need help.
Guys hello.

743
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,160
What the hell happened?

744
00:49:21,361 --> 00:49:24,195
I do not know, I heard a bang,
and then he was gone, he must have fallen.

745
00:49:24,196 --> 00:49:29,909
What, what happened?
- He must have fought with anything.

746
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,867
The camera recorded it.

747
00:49:37,668 --> 00:49:39,768
Did you see that? Did you see that fucking.

748
00:49:41,526 --> 00:49:44,635
I want to fuck away.
- Tessa, we gotta go.

749
00:49:44,636 --> 00:49:46,360
Come on.

750
00:49:49,808 --> 00:49:52,035
output, come on here is an output.

751
00:49:52,936 --> 00:49:55,780
Call 911
- It does not work, I have no coverage.

752
00:49:55,781 --> 00:49:58,065
Keep moving, we call when we get outside.
Come on.

753
00:49:58,066 --> 00:50:00,195
Jerry's fucking dead.

754
00:50:02,196 --> 00:50:04,267
What?
- Goddamn.

755
00:50:05,368 --> 00:50:07,019
Here there is no fucking exit.

756
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:10,914
This is not impossible, look at the glow-sticks.

757
00:50:10,915 --> 00:50:13,417
Maybe the guard moved them.
That is not possible.

758
00:50:13,418 --> 00:50:15,858
Why would the guard do?
- I do not know.

759
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:21,606
Calm down.
- Shoot.

760
00:50:22,507 --> 00:50:24,207
Where the hell are you.

761
00:50:27,476 --> 00:50:29,687
Okay, it says here that we are here.

762
00:50:29,688 --> 00:50:31,898
Two steps down that way.

763
00:50:31,899 --> 00:50:34,400
This stands on its head,
the exit is that way.

764
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:37,026
We are on the fourth floor.
- What are you talking about?

765
00:50:37,027 --> 00:50:41,198
Alex, do you look up here for?
- What's the point?

766
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:43,742
So we can find an exit.

767
00:50:43,743 --> 00:50:48,758
You do not understand,
that card is useless.

768
00:50:53,921 --> 00:50:58,438
My god, this place looks terrible.

769
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:17,686
Look, would also have been children?

770
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:25,134
I'll go first.

771
00:51:42,741 --> 00:51:45,505
Do you see that?
- Yes.

772
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:50,084
He moves.
Take this down?

773
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:53,464
Trevor, come back.
- Trevor stay there. Trevor stop.

774
00:51:54,473 --> 00:51:56,097
...

775
00:51:59,648 --> 00:52:01,568
What is she doing here?

776
00:52:02,796 --> 00:52:07,795
Hi, I'm Kaitlin.
What is your name?

777
00:52:08,052 --> 00:52:10,433
Will you play with me?

778
00:52:12,602 --> 00:52:14,474
Or do you...

779
00:52:29,198 --> 00:52:31,657
Guys wait.
Slower. Tessa.

780
00:52:35,676 --> 00:52:37,475
Tessa.
- What the hell?

781
00:52:37,698 --> 00:52:40,796
What, what is it?

782
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:44,773
Did you hear that?
- Tessa.

783
00:52:55,257 --> 00:52:57,402
Where the hell are you?

784
00:53:09,745 --> 00:53:12,309
Fuck.
Leave me alone.

785
00:53:36,011 --> 00:53:41,262
How does this thing work?
Come on.

786
00:53:42,644 --> 00:53:44,895
Boys.

787
00:53:47,899 --> 00:53:50,921
Alex.
Oh God.

788
00:53:57,201 --> 00:54:01,515
Boys.
Where are you?

789
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:17,310
touch me.
Do not touch me.

790
00:54:22,411 --> 00:54:24,611
Stay the fuck away from me.

791
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:56,914
My name is Alex Wright.

792
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:59,741
This is Jennifer Parker and
that's Trevor Thompson.

793
00:54:59,998 --> 00:55:03,994
We came here to find evidence
the movie Grave Encounters real.

794
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,963
fuck all really.

795
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:13,131
We have Jerry and Tessa already lost.
I do not think they have found.

796
00:55:13,388 --> 00:55:17,300
Do not say that.

797
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:20,595
There must be a reason why the
has brought us here.

798
00:55:20,852 --> 00:55:24,057
Why you have brought me here?

799
00:55:24,314 --> 00:55:26,858
I do not understand.

800
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:31,111
He wants me to film everything, but...

801
00:55:31,368 --> 00:55:34,730
I do not know why...
- Turn the fucking camera off.

802
00:55:34,953 --> 00:55:36,663
Somebody turn off the camera.

803
00:55:45,714 --> 00:55:49,122
I let anything happen to you, okay?

804
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,159
done nothing to you.

805
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:06,712
Why do we fuck up?

806
00:56:13,058 --> 00:56:17,290
What is that?
- Alex, please do not go inside.

807
00:56:18,412 --> 00:56:20,004
What if Tessa?

808
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:22,804
That's not it.

809
00:56:26,664 --> 00:56:30,437
Turn it off, Alex.
Turn it off.

810
00:56:31,738 --> 00:56:34,338
Turn it off fucking.

811
00:56:36,263 --> 00:56:38,237
the guard.

812
00:56:44,936 --> 00:56:46,917
Is he dead?

813
00:56:48,691 --> 00:56:50,302
I think so.

814
00:56:55,112 --> 00:56:56,757
Turn it off, please.

815
00:57:00,818 --> 00:57:02,757
Get it off me, please.

816
00:57:36,216 --> 00:57:39,431
Why were we so stupid to come here?

817
00:57:41,979 --> 00:57:45,096
I can not believe it.

818
00:57:49,296 --> 00:57:50,958
Guys, look.

819
00:57:51,497 --> 00:57:53,469
It seems so loose.

820
00:57:53,692 --> 00:57:56,462
What? Okay let's go.
Hurry.

821
00:57:59,296 --> 00:58:02,413
Do not just stand there, give me a crowbar.

822
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:04,912
Shoot.
Come on.

823
00:58:09,622 --> 00:58:12,002
Come on Sean. Come on.

824
00:58:12,746 --> 00:58:15,998
Damn.
Okay, let's...

825
00:58:18,135 --> 00:58:20,618
Let's just leave...

826
00:58:28,281 --> 00:58:31,669
We must return
... - Come on.

827
00:58:33,828 --> 00:58:35,341
Racing.

828
00:58:48,386 --> 00:58:50,383
Racing.
- Come on Jen, come on.

829
00:58:59,892 --> 00:59:01,525
outta boys.

830
00:59:05,817 --> 00:59:08,352
Jerry.

831
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:11,497
We should go.

832
00:59:23,739 --> 00:59:25,536
Take that damn camera.

833
00:59:33,543 --> 00:59:36,583
We came out of the building.
We fucking met.

834
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:40,801
Did you see that?
I told you it was real.

835
00:59:45,978 --> 00:59:48,718
Alex.
- Alex what the hell are you doing?

836
00:59:48,975 --> 00:59:50,526
Alex, come here.

837
00:59:55,312 --> 00:59:59,393
They are dead.
- Think not, grab your stuff.

838
00:59:59,822 --> 01:00:03,404
We must do something,
we can not just go.

839
01:00:03,661 --> 01:00:05,401
I do not know what to do.

840
01:00:14,796 --> 01:00:16,671
Come on, hurry up.

841
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:44,392
I do not know why you so obsessed
was through that damn movie.

842
01:00:45,533 --> 01:00:48,064
Sorry, I did not
everything that would happen.

843
01:00:48,321 --> 01:00:49,995
Tessa's probably dead.

844
01:00:51,288 --> 01:00:55,710
You and your damn project.
- Keep your own mouth.

845
01:00:58,724 --> 01:01:00,556
What the hell?

846
01:01:04,342 --> 01:01:07,310
No. We were in the hotel.

847
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:10,599
Do not. That is useless.
- We were in the building.

848
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:12,537
What do you mean in the building?

849
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,053
Everyone in the building is going
fucking dead.

850
01:01:20,289 --> 01:01:22,219
Pack your bag, okay?

851
01:01:35,788 --> 01:01:39,152
No, I do not wanna go.
- You have to walk.

852
01:01:39,375 --> 01:01:43,786
This is nonsense. Where do we go now?

853
01:01:52,512 --> 01:01:54,851
I will not fucking die.

854
01:01:56,743 --> 01:01:58,654
Then everything for nothing.

855
01:02:00,686 --> 01:02:04,469
I think it anytime from spinning.

856
01:02:29,425 --> 01:02:33,725
What the hell is that?
Are you okay?

857
01:02:35,926 --> 01:02:38,915
Jennifer.
- Alex, where are you?

858
01:02:39,178 --> 01:02:40,903
Where the hell are you, Jenny?

859
01:02:43,268 --> 01:02:46,414
Jennifer, where are you?
- I'm here.

860
01:02:47,015 --> 01:02:49,115
Trevor, converts the thermal camera.

861
01:02:51,399 --> 01:02:57,441
Can you see anything?
- Forward, walk toward my voice.

862
01:02:57,898 --> 01:02:59,659
I'm here.

863
01:03:00,366 --> 01:03:03,610
this way.
I'm here.

864
01:03:14,455 --> 01:03:17,485
What do you see?
- What is it?

865
01:03:20,942 --> 01:03:23,493
Turn that light off.

866
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:25,250
Please help us.

867
01:03:26,598 --> 01:03:29,200
Please.
- Follow me, come on.

868
01:03:38,109 --> 01:03:39,798
it.

869
01:03:45,491 --> 01:03:47,297
Shoot.

870
01:03:51,588 --> 01:03:53,518
Trevor, is that you behind me?

871
01:03:56,167 --> 01:03:57,784
Get out.

872
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:03,743
Guys, wait up.
My foot's stuck.

873
01:04:03,862 --> 01:04:05,451
Guys, wait up.

874
01:04:19,509 --> 01:04:21,256
What the hell?

875
01:04:24,442 --> 01:04:28,428
Trevor. My God.
Where were you? What's happened to you?

876
01:04:32,712 --> 01:04:36,231
What happened?
- I do not wanna talk about it.

877
01:04:36,488 --> 01:04:38,084
Who are you?

878
01:04:39,671 --> 01:04:41,409
you live here?

879
01:04:51,467 --> 01:04:53,009
Wait...

880
01:04:54,555 --> 01:04:58,221
You're Lance Preston.
Sean Rogerson actor anyway?

881
01:04:58,642 --> 01:05:01,437
Lived you all the time?

882
01:05:13,113 --> 01:05:15,193
What's he doing?

883
01:05:19,494 --> 01:05:23,105
Hello buddy. You're my friend, right?

884
01:05:29,771 --> 01:05:33,453
My God.
I think I will puke.

885
01:05:36,969 --> 01:05:38,639
Want some?

886
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:43,253
You must help us to find a way out of this cursed
building.

887
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:45,077
Are you a patient?

888
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:47,122
What?
All patients?

889
01:05:49,337 --> 01:05:51,091
Where was your husband?

890
01:05:52,274 --> 01:05:55,164
Sean, we are not patients.
We are film students...

891
01:05:55,421 --> 01:05:56,957
we broke into the building.

892
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:00,393
Why?
Why would you do that?

893
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:05,598
I must know the truth about your movie.

894
01:06:06,116 --> 01:06:09,010
What movie?

895
01:06:12,458 --> 01:06:15,970
Good evening and welcome to another episode of
Grave Encounters.

896
01:06:16,796 --> 01:06:18,993
Your Grave Encounters movie...
.

897
01:06:24,889 --> 01:06:26,649
Ashley.

898
01:06:33,763 --> 01:06:37,708
There must be a way out, something.
You must know something.

899
01:06:37,808 --> 01:06:41,113
Katie has the keys.

900
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:46,023
not fucking touch me.

901
01:06:46,024 --> 01:06:48,845
She comes to us,
wait a few more days.

902
01:06:48,945 --> 01:06:50,531
She does not listen to me.

903
01:06:50,831 --> 01:06:53,718
She committed suicide.
She's not for you.

904
01:06:54,118 --> 01:06:58,749
You must know something, you've been here nine years.
A vent, a fucking window, anything.

905
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:03,377
2 days, 11 hours.

906
01:07:03,378 --> 01:07:04,404
nine months, two days 11 hours.

907
01:07:04,504 --> 01:07:08,283
Think you here for 9 months now.
You've been here nine years...

908
01:07:08,383 --> 01:07:10,552
not nine months, you understand?

909
01:07:11,553 --> 01:07:13,289
your mom, okay,
I met your mother.

910
01:07:13,389 --> 01:07:16,210
A nice lady.
Nice lady, but she is very sick.

911
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:20,102
Your mother is very ill.
- Shut up.

912
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,266
Trev, wake up.

913
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:40,111
Alex, why do you film this?

914
01:07:40,211 --> 01:07:43,762
This guy is completely insane.
- Look, it's like a psychopath.

915
01:07:44,963 --> 01:07:47,163
10 years on this fucking place.

916
01:07:47,252 --> 01:07:52,738
Why did you give him a pair of scissors?
- He does not do anything, it's okay.

917
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:58,219
I do not trust him.

918
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:05,820
Sean, what are these drawings?

919
01:08:10,579 --> 01:08:12,468
That's the door.

920
01:08:16,169 --> 01:08:17,769
Is not that nice?

921
01:08:18,671 --> 01:08:21,297
This makes no sense.

922
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:25,552
No, you know?
It leads nowhere.

923
01:08:25,553 --> 01:08:29,749
It's just a detached door.
You can just through it.

924
01:08:29,849 --> 01:08:32,477
Maybe, maybe not.

925
01:08:32,478 --> 01:08:35,324
Sean
gone through every door in this building.

926
01:08:35,824 --> 01:08:40,163
Except this.
- This is our way out.

927
01:08:45,351 --> 01:08:49,735
He's too fat.
- The bolt cutter cut therethrough.

928
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:58,799
Got a bolt cutter?
- Yes...

929
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,420
we had a bag of tools,
but we are lost.

930
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,399
Where is it, are you lost?

931
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,748
The building is huge.
It's big.

932
01:09:11,646 --> 01:09:14,883
It's as big as a city.
- It's bigger and bigger and bigger.

933
01:09:14,983 --> 01:09:17,028
It changes constantly.

934
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:19,798
But there are patterns.

935
01:09:20,699 --> 01:09:22,393
I encountered them.

936
01:09:22,493 --> 01:09:24,294
Where did you get the bag left behind?

937
01:09:24,995 --> 01:09:29,971
I do not know, it was a hall
with all bathtubs in the rooms.

938
01:09:35,342 --> 01:09:40,126
4 hours, 6.
7, 8 pm.

939
01:09:40,227 --> 01:09:46,185
This is crazy, it is a detached door.
That door leads nowhere.

940
01:09:46,186 --> 01:09:50,784
Alex, this is not Narnia.
- No, sorry but this is crazy. It's stupid.

941
01:09:50,884 --> 01:09:52,760
You know what else is weird?
a hotel through...

942
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:55,555
and end at the same place as
where you started.

943
01:09:55,655 --> 01:09:57,472
We have spared this field

944
01:09:57,572 --> 01:10:00,308
What's in there?
- That's where Dr. Friedkin's.

945
01:10:00,408 --> 01:10:01,643
mean Friedkin doctor?

946
01:10:01,743 --> 01:10:06,915
He was the head here.
I've read about him, he was occult.

947
01:10:06,916 --> 01:10:10,939
Rituals in the basement.
Experiments in the patients.

948
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,534
Where do you get this from?

949
01:10:14,634 --> 01:10:16,326
That's where he went inside.

950
01:10:23,768 --> 01:10:27,665
She opened the door, you know?
Friedkin did.

951
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:31,718
They took
the real world and the spiritual world...

952
01:10:31,818 --> 01:10:34,600
and he... added together.

953
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:42,048
Then he drew a hole in the building
and went inside. That door...

954
01:10:42,949 --> 01:10:46,229
is the only way.
You gotta believe me.

955
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:53,003
Alex, come on.

956
01:10:53,004 --> 01:10:56,595
I can not believe we're doing this,
why we follow him, Alex?

957
01:10:56,596 --> 01:11:00,688
Friend, I have a bad feeling about him.
- We have no choice, right?

958
01:11:05,733 --> 01:11:09,220
I thought you knew where you were going.
- Wait.

959
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,731
.

960
01:11:11,531 --> 01:11:14,362
Come on, let's go.
We will not wait.

961
01:11:24,303 --> 01:11:26,043
Please delete it.

962
01:11:30,011 --> 01:11:31,812
See, I told you?

963
01:11:32,513 --> 01:11:34,278
Jesus Christ.

964
01:11:36,777 --> 01:11:41,118
What was that?
- Listen, come here.

965
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:51,878
You know you drink water
a fucking toilet, right?

966
01:12:04,673 --> 01:12:08,771
What are you doing?
Jesus Christ.

967
01:12:12,222 --> 01:12:15,897
here, help me.
It should bring us to the other side.

968
01:12:31,411 --> 01:12:33,748
Are you okay, man?
- Trevor.

969
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:36,358
nothing beats
- okay?

970
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:40,260
Trevor, the bag there?
- Yes, the bag is here.

971
01:12:47,554 --> 01:12:50,421
What is this now?
- Did you see me?

972
01:12:53,699 --> 01:12:55,499
Where is the bag? Got the bag?

973
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:02,760
This could work.
- Okay, but what do we do now?

974
01:13:04,861 --> 01:13:06,361
We rest for a few hours.

975
01:13:07,952 --> 01:13:09,655
And then I see what's behind the door.

976
01:13:10,455 --> 01:13:14,873
What are you doing?
- In case something happens to me...

977
01:14:38,696 --> 01:14:41,696
Fuck you, Alex.
Fuck, Jameson.

978
01:14:43,297 --> 01:14:45,097
Fool.

979
01:14:54,697 --> 01:14:58,034
Mom, Dad...

980
01:15:00,035 --> 01:15:03,648
Jason, if you look at this...

981
01:15:05,249 --> 01:15:08,335
means,
I'm probably dead.

982
01:15:09,336 --> 01:15:13,946
So I think, this is my last will and testament
.

983
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:32,053
I would not be here, but I'm here.

984
01:15:32,153 --> 01:15:36,452
I'll fucking a will.

985
01:15:36,775 --> 01:15:40,643
I'm dying, I just wanna go home.

986
01:15:47,422 --> 01:15:51,382
Hello? Is there anyone?

987
01:15:59,434 --> 01:16:01,524
Hello?

988
01:16:05,098 --> 01:16:07,140
What the hell?

989
01:16:15,329 --> 01:16:17,869
Sean, you scared me, what do you want?

990
01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:38,829
I must do him.

991
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:41,302
I must do him.

992
01:17:14,393 --> 01:17:17,366
You've done that.

993
01:17:22,653 --> 01:17:24,271
We just woke up.

994
01:17:25,072 --> 01:17:28,004
And Trevor's death, we found him
in one of the bathrooms.

995
01:17:39,714 --> 01:17:42,804
I had to listen to Trevor,
I should trust him.

996
01:17:46,216 --> 01:17:51,377
Sean, took all our stuff. The bolt cutters,
water. What he left behind...

997
01:17:51,477 --> 01:17:55,063
had this fucking bag.

998
01:17:55,064 --> 01:17:57,884
We will never come out of this building,
we die here.

999
01:17:57,984 --> 01:18:02,113
Listen to me, calm down...
- Stop filming me.

1000
01:18:02,114 --> 01:18:05,949
Stop filming me.
What the hell is wrong with you?

1001
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:07,313
Listen to me...

1002
01:18:07,514 --> 01:18:12,401
because I let anything happen.

1003
01:18:12,702 --> 01:18:14,044
Okay?

1004
01:18:14,544 --> 01:18:18,323
I let anything happen,
we come here, I promise you.

1005
01:18:18,324 --> 01:18:23,009
Okay, now?
- I do not know.

1006
01:18:31,449 --> 01:18:33,749
card, the card sucks.

1007
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:37,345
Can you read it?

1008
01:18:38,446 --> 01:18:41,824
Can you read it?
- Yes, yes, I think so.

1009
01:18:41,825 --> 01:18:44,213
Yes, we must go to the room with the door.
We need the bolt cutter...

1010
01:18:44,313 --> 01:18:46,483
that's our only chance
to get out of here, okay?

1011
01:18:53,045 --> 01:18:56,460
Are you sure it's that way?
They look at something.

1012
01:18:57,737 --> 01:19:02,832
It is long since I was on camera.
Maybe I'm a little rusty.

1013
01:19:02,932 --> 01:19:06,309
Maybe I'm a little rusty.

1014
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:11,242
I'm Lance Preston, welcome to a new
episode of "Grave Encounters".

1015
01:19:12,443 --> 01:19:17,125
welcome to a new
episode of 'Grave...

1016
01:19:18,699 --> 01:19:24,170
I'm Lance Preston, welcome to a new
episode of "Grave Encounters".

1017
01:19:24,871 --> 01:19:28,401
The rest of the crew, is no longer with us.

1018
01:19:28,501 --> 01:19:33,241
But I'm still here, if we're lucky, we might
make contact with them.

1019
01:19:33,841 --> 01:19:38,172
Why did you close the door, Lance?
I want to go back to the hotel.

1020
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:42,600
I feel a dark and evil spirit, Lance.

1021
01:19:42,601 --> 01:19:47,862
It may be a demon.
Who plays this character.

1022
01:19:51,663 --> 01:19:55,163
I'm outta here. Which way is the room?
What is the correct door?

1023
01:20:22,664 --> 01:20:24,264
Finally.

1024
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:37,987
Goddamn, what the hell
.

1025
01:20:39,989 --> 01:20:42,584
No.

1026
01:20:42,619 --> 01:20:45,553
Nonsense.
You broke your promise.

1027
01:20:46,254 --> 01:20:50,945
Liar. All nonsense.
Liar.

1028
01:20:55,473 --> 01:20:57,541
Give me the camera.

1029
01:21:02,544 --> 01:21:05,698
You said only one of us who
red door could go.

1030
01:21:05,925 --> 01:21:09,877
I've even killed
so they would not follow me.

1031
01:21:09,947 --> 01:21:11,576
What did I do wrong?

1032
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:15,034
Answer.

1033
01:21:15,035 --> 01:21:18,535
<i> Get the others. </ I>

1034
01:21:20,043 --> 01:21:22,860
How do I do that?
If you do not let me go?

1035
01:21:27,161 --> 01:21:29,361
<i> Collect the tapes. </ I>

1036
01:21:29,638 --> 01:21:33,305
Collect the tapes...
you want me to collect the material.

1037
01:21:33,975 --> 01:21:37,742
Yes, I do.
I can try.

1038
01:21:44,204 --> 01:21:46,404
<i> Make the movie. </ I>

1039
01:21:46,405 --> 01:21:48,391
What movie?

1040
01:21:48,491 --> 01:21:52,236
What are you talking about?
Hello?

1041
01:21:55,268 --> 01:21:59,104
Okay.
Collect the tapes.

1042
01:22:00,305 --> 01:22:04,405
Collect the tapes.

1043
01:22:06,006 --> 01:22:09,506
Collect the tapes.
I must collect the tapes.

1044
01:22:16,689 --> 01:22:19,104
Are you sure we should go this way?

1045
01:22:19,604 --> 01:22:21,663
According to the map is here.

1046
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:24,190
Jennifer?
- Here it is.

1047
01:22:24,491 --> 01:22:30,006
Wait. Sean told us that we had to avoid
surgical department.

1048
01:22:31,181 --> 01:22:34,081
I do not think we have any other choice.

1049
01:22:43,051 --> 01:22:44,774
What are these things for?

1050
01:22:47,204 --> 01:22:48,876
My god.

1051
01:22:52,642 --> 01:22:55,052
Why did Dr. Friedkin this?
- Goddamn.

1052
01:23:05,202 --> 01:23:08,298
Alex this is not good.
We gotta go, keep moving.

1053
01:23:09,999 --> 01:23:11,860
Let's get outta here.

1054
01:23:16,923 --> 01:23:18,482
Come on.

1055
01:23:24,182 --> 01:23:26,729
Turn off the light.

1056
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:29,530
not talk, be quiet.

1057
01:23:31,531 --> 01:23:33,431
Be still, be still, damn.

1058
01:23:58,074 --> 01:24:01,713
Is that Doctor Friedkin?
- Do not, do not.

1059
01:24:02,759 --> 01:24:04,932
Jennifer, be still.
Shut up.

1060
01:24:47,933 --> 01:24:49,691
Is this a joke or something.

1061
01:25:16,031 --> 01:25:20,314
in. Close the door.

1062
01:25:23,239 --> 01:25:25,442
Okay, I think we're here.
- You said you could read.

1063
01:25:25,477 --> 01:25:27,411
I do my best.
- Are you sure?

1064
01:25:27,511 --> 01:25:29,875
I do not fucking.

1065
01:25:32,876 --> 01:25:35,376
Damn, Jennifer, look.

1066
01:25:36,245 --> 01:25:39,968
How did we get here.
- How do we get the hell out.

1067
01:25:40,542 --> 01:25:43,267
It seems that he has already been
do you think he has gone through?

1068
01:25:45,283 --> 01:25:47,283
Looks.

1069
01:25:47,766 --> 01:25:50,321
We're too late.
- We're too late, he has escaped.

1070
01:25:53,927 --> 01:25:58,561
Well, it does not work.
- You killed Trevor, stupid fool.

1071
01:25:59,839 --> 01:26:05,359
Your friend was dead,
at the moment he entered the building.

1072
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,213
Those were all of you.

1073
01:26:09,814 --> 01:26:12,014
Alex, look at this.

1074
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:18,617
He said that if one of us has all tires.
That he can go.

1075
01:26:19,418 --> 01:26:21,142
And that would be me.

1076
01:26:23,124 --> 01:26:25,672
Now you must stay behind.

1077
01:26:28,763 --> 01:26:31,811
I've been here too long.

1078
01:26:32,169 --> 01:26:38,078
Have you any idea what ten years here,
can do to a person?

1079
01:26:40,441 --> 01:26:42,117
I just wanna go home.

1080
01:26:44,914 --> 01:26:48,024
Well, give me the recording of your cameras.

1081
01:26:48,525 --> 01:26:50,294
I need to finish the movie.

1082
01:26:51,495 --> 01:26:53,381
I give you anything.

1083
01:26:54,582 --> 01:26:56,435
This is my movie.

1084
01:26:57,336 --> 01:27:00,739
The building says I
the movie must finish.

1085
01:27:00,839 --> 01:27:03,103
Give me the damn pictures...

1086
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:06,907
Give me the recordings.

1087
01:27:21,112 --> 01:27:24,821
Let him go.
- That is only if he dies.

1088
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:30,812
building chose me and not you.

1089
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:34,190
I need to finish the film.

1090
01:27:38,881 --> 01:27:40,869
Are you okay? Is it?

1091
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:45,878
fucking bitch.

1092
01:27:46,598 --> 01:27:48,196
I'll kill you.

1093
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:21,894
Hang.
- I can not.

1094
01:28:26,352 --> 01:28:28,985
I did what you asked liar.

1095
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:47,943
Alex?

1096
01:28:49,544 --> 01:28:51,532
Alex, are you?

1097
01:28:54,333 --> 01:28:58,171
He's gone, he's
sucked.

1098
01:28:59,672 --> 01:29:01,713
What do we do now?

1099
01:29:12,196 --> 01:29:17,043
I try to finish the film.

1100
01:29:17,074 --> 01:29:19,868
The film finish.

1101
01:29:19,869 --> 01:29:23,302
This was all about.
Why they contacted me.

1102
01:29:25,833 --> 01:29:27,870
The building wants an end.

1103
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:30,145
Alex, what are you talking about?

1104
01:29:33,677 --> 01:29:38,651
I think I just
the end of my film have invented.

1105
01:29:40,768 --> 01:29:43,130
You're the star.

1106
01:29:46,817 --> 01:29:49,069
Alex, what are you doing?

1107
01:29:49,777 --> 01:29:52,119
You heard him.

1108
01:29:52,363 --> 01:29:56,270
One of us will come here.
So what do you think, Jennifer?

1109
01:29:56,370 --> 01:29:59,336
You've always said you wanted...

1110
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:02,401
your last film was a hero story, right?

1111
01:30:02,501 --> 01:30:05,797
This is the scene, do not make it harder than it needs to be
.

1112
01:30:07,256 --> 01:30:10,364
Alex, please...

1113
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:15,668
I'm sorry.

1114
01:30:19,102 --> 01:30:22,226
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1115
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:33,087
Alex. No.

1116
01:30:39,541 --> 01:30:41,419
It's over.

1117
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:44,811
Go to sleep.

1118
01:30:50,973 --> 01:30:52,766
I did it.

1119
01:30:53,616 --> 01:30:57,425
Make your movie.
Others will see it and come.

1120
01:31:00,773 --> 01:31:02,788
I will not disappoint you.

1121
01:32:15,691 --> 01:32:18,862
Sir, I have a 41 here on the A5.

1122
01:32:21,363 --> 01:32:25,241
7823, we have a white man...

1123
01:32:25,242 --> 01:32:26,652
with a bag, I call for the strengthening...

1124
01:32:27,053 --> 01:32:30,086
Sir.

1125
01:32:30,243 --> 01:32:34,383
No, not my camera.
I need him. I'm not going back...

1126
01:32:34,672 --> 01:32:36,534
I got my camera.

1127
01:32:38,069 --> 01:32:41,077
Where am I?

1128
01:32:42,235 --> 01:32:45,511
In what city am I?
- You're in LA.

1129
01:32:56,403 --> 01:33:00,266
Jerry, can you tell us how the
Grave Encounters 2 form received?

1130
01:33:00,366 --> 01:33:05,997
Well sure, I was as surprised as anyone
when this guy came to my office...

1131
01:33:06,097 --> 01:33:09,208
to say that he is the sequel to
Grave Encounters had made. I mean...

1132
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:13,279
I thought he was crazy, but Alex
here...

1133
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:17,368
a talented director and I think
has a bright future.

1134
01:33:17,468 --> 01:33:22,416
This has everything. It has ghosts
send messages over the Internet.

1135
01:33:22,516 --> 01:33:26,003
Young girls are murdered,
boys are sucked into the walls.

1136
01:33:26,103 --> 01:33:29,750
.. it's incredible material.
Hope you enjoyed it.

1137
01:33:30,851 --> 01:33:36,514
I want to be clear about something, I made
this error with the first film.

1138
01:33:36,614 --> 01:33:39,042
Everything you've just seen
is counterfeit.

1139
01:33:39,442 --> 01:33:43,128
Okay, every scene has improved
or manipulated.

1140
01:33:44,129 --> 01:33:45,799
It's just a movie.

1141
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,564
Is there anything else you want to add
before we close?

1142
01:33:50,564 --> 01:33:53,492
Look, whatever you do.
Do not go to that building looking.

1143
01:33:53,592 --> 01:33:56,387
not seeking...
It's not worth it.

1144
01:33:57,588 --> 01:33:59,286
There's nothing there.
