1
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,915
Our war is going better than ever.

2
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,551
But we need heroes! We need you.

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,357
Come on, you apes!
You wanna live forever?

4
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,355
Service guarantees citizenship.
Would you like to know more?

5
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,510
The sky marshal launches
Operation March to Victory.

6
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,433
A bold, new strategy
calling for total war...

7
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,229
...against the Bug, on every front.

8
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,000
Would you like to know more?

9
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,350
Look out! Look out!

10
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,473
Fall back!

11
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,996
Retreat! Retreat!

12
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,878
- We need pickup now!
- Yes, sir!

13
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,318
Sir, this is Mobile Infantry Bravo 6
to Fleet Rescue.

14
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,711
It's Bravo 6 to Fleet Rescue.

15
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,394
Fall back!

16
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,958
Retreat!

17
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,277
Horton, Sandee, pull back!

18
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,550
Help me with this, goddamn it!

19
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,748
You're okay, Sandee. I got you.

20
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,479
- You're okay!
- Hold what you've got!

21
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,515
- Come on, Bug!
- Tor!

22
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,557
Cover our 6!

23
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,029
Oh, that 6.

24
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,918
Hey, Bug!

25
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,194
Do you copy? Do you copy?

26
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,277
Brick! Cover Tor!

27
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,352
- Tor.
- Come and get some from Tor, baby!

28
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,311
Otter!

29
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,789
Fight or die, soldier!

30
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,477
- Private Sahara!
- Yes, sergeant?

31
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,712
Private Otter is a dead man.
If he won't fight, shoot him!

32
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,711
Sir!

33
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,759
Just pull the trigger, Billie!
It's not enough, but it'll have to do.

34
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,679
- Fleet Rescue to Brav o 6.
- Go ahead, Fleet Rescue.

35
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,276
Fleet Rescue to Brav o 6,
rescue priority is no-go, MI.

36
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,194
Colt-Victor-one-niner is negative
for pickup!

37
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,670
Hold the perimeter!
Hold that line!

38
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,751
- Hold the line!
- I don't want excuses!

39
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,512
I want a crossfire!

40
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,240
Get in and plug that hole.
Plug that hole!

41
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,517
- General, Fleet's no-go for pickup.
- We gotta make a move.

42
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,989
- Hold the line!
- Bugs have got Coy!

43
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,869
This is General Shepherd.
You jackass! We need pickup!

44
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,676
Bravo 6 to Fleet Rescue,
do you copy?

45
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,236
General, getting a vision.
It isn't clear.

46
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,113
They're building up.
They're all around us.

47
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,915
Lieutenant, you're the psychic!
Tell me something I don't know!

48
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,759
It's something massive.
It'll take us all out.

49
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,390
- I can't get it all, but...
- General! There's an outpost.

50
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,313
Hotel Delta 185,
abandoned eight days ago!

51
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,959
Half a klick that way.

52
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,675
- Middle of Satan's Anvil?
- Bugs own that real estate, general.

53
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,472
There's no cover on the Anvil.

54
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,830
We're gonna have a rough ride,
lieutenant!

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,274
Yes, sir.

56
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,556
You, you, you, and you, stay here.

57
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,472
Everybody else move out!

58
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,269
Request permission to remain
with the general.

59
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,953
- That's negative, Rake.
- Sir?

60
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,714
- Lieutenant Dill will assume command.
- Yes, sir!

61
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,599
He's the psychic.
You're the war fighter!

62
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,440
Move them out, sergeant!
Give them hell!

63
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,712
Yes, sir!
Prepare to withdraw.

64
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,711
Withdraw!

65
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,310
- Let's go, move it, move it, move it!
- Come on, Billie.

66
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,516
Keep going!

67
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,149
Let's go!

68
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,476
Follow me!

69
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,634
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

70
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,679
- Get out!
- Go, go, go! Come on!

71
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,157
Let's go!

72
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,276
Let's go!

73
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,714
Move it!

74
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,916
Move it, move it, move it!

75
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,953
Where's my frigging outpost, corporal?

76
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,669
It's here. We're here...

77
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,149
About time, corporal.
That soup's gonna boil!

78
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,198
- Move out!
- Let's go! Come on, come on!

79
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,555
- Let's go! Come on, suck it up!
- Hurry up!

80
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,598
Move, move, move!

81
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,074
- Take cover!
- Let's get out of here!

82
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,194
Move it, Otter!
Come on, move it.

83
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,994
Come on! Hurry up.

84
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,832
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go.

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,150
Come on.

86
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,039
- Get down!
- Over there!

87
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,997
- Hurry up.
- Grab that door.

88
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,513
Bill, help me, help me...

89
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,509
Come on, Billie, come on!

90
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,994
Take my hand!

91
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,878
Come on! Stay down.

92
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,354
No!

93
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,675
- Come on!
- It's okay. I got you.

94
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,950
Otter, Kobe, get down!

95
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,794
Keep going.
Come on.

96
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,594
- Keep moving. Keep moving.
- Come on.

97
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,678
- Go.
- Kobe, look out!

98
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,798
Tor! Brick!

99
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,235
With me! Move!

100
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,399
Tor, Horton! Get Kobe inside!

101
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,597
- Brick, with me. Go!
- Come on!

102
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,149
Stay with me, buddy!

103
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,278
Sandee! Move on!

104
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,590
Here we go.
You're all right, you're all right.

105
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,478
Brick! You and Sandee...

106
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,189
...take a squad, set a perimeter.
Sahara? Get that door closed.

107
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,554
Sir!

108
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,870
Make a hole!

109
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,069
- Make it wide!
- Sahara! Out of the way!

110
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,155
- Coming through.
- Get out of the way!

111
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,992
Right, easy. Take it easy.

112
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,991
Watch his back.

113
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,877
Get his pack off!
Horton, cut that radio off!

114
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,837
Get that off him.

115
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,639
Take it easy.

116
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,951
You're all right.
Where are those meds?

117
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,552
Where are those meds?
Damn it!

118
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,716
- Sergeant?
- It's fine.

119
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,792
- Sergeant!
- Just take it easy. Take it easy.

120
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,793
I want someone on that com,
and I want pickup.

121
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,110
Yes, sir, wouldn't we all?

122
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,355
- That's a direct order, sergeant.
- No-go on the door, sarge.

123
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,949
Stay down. Relax, buddy.
You gotta relax.

124
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,714
Why can't you do anything
for this man, Tor?

125
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,914
Private!

126
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,878
Get on that com.
I want pickup now!

127
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,474
- What are you looking at, private?
- Sir, com don't run without power.

128
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,599
Well, at OCS, you learn that a sergeant
is the solution to any problem.

129
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,478
So you get the power up.

130
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,632
They say what kind of boat
Fleet lands in a shit-storm?

131
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,473
I am giving the orders!
You will take them!

132
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,110
I want the goddamn power!
And I want it now!

133
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,631
I am waiting, sergeant.

134
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,189
Horton, Otter, Sahara, with me.

135
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,236
Shit. Sir?

136
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,717
Might want to see this.

137
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,800
Radio's nonoperational.

138
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,916
Coming, lieutenant?

139
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,957
Looks like Colonel Hohlback
left in a hurry.

140
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,036
What the hell is that?

141
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,351
I'd say we've got company.

142
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,149
Horton! You and Otter locate
the reactors and fire them up.

143
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,754
What is that?

144
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,550
Outpost incinerator.

145
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,871
Move away from the door!

146
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,952
Why are you still here, soldier?

147
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,553
Probably because no
one lit the furnace.

148
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,472
Captain V.J. Dax.

149
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,631
Says here he's a big hero.

150
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,351
Combat medals, Bronze Stars, Purple
Heart, Purple Heart, Purple Heart.

151
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,636
Federal Medal of Valour
at Widowmakers.

152
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,028
That's a lot of crap.

153
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,476
Wounded four times, refused numerous
battlefield commissions...

154
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,517
Give me that.

155
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,197
- Some hero.
- You murdered Colonel Hohlback?

156
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,430
He had his Morita and a sidearm.

157
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,749
I just used my hands.

158
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,876
You're a disgrace to the uniform.

159
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,793
He's a mad dog.
He stays in the cage.

160
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,635
Just remember, lieutenant,
every dog has its day!

161
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,268
Sarge! Hostiles!

162
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,396
I am in command here, private.

163
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,356
Now, how many and
what's our situation?

164
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,512
- Looks like a whole damn circus.
- Let's go.

165
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,079
Trooper!

166
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,513
Shelter!
Right perimeter, spread wide!

167
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,433
You three, follow me.

168
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,512
- He's spreading us too thin!
- You know something I don't, trooper?

169
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,438
They're shifting their lines!

170
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,470
You, take the left!
Take the middle! Take the right!

171
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,960
Sandee! Report!

172
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,156
Nothing! No movement!

173
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,514
Come on, you bastards!
What are you waiting for?

174
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,908
Shut up, fathead!

175
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,231
- You starting with me?
- Just like covering your 6, huh?

176
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,836
Prepare to fire!

177
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,358
Otter, get up!

178
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,274
Fire! Fire! Fire!

179
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,349
Come on! Bug!

180
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,471
Son of a bitch!

181
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,631
Pull back!

182
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,950
Come on, go, go!
I got you covered!

183
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,271
Billie. It's okay. It's okay!

184
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,750
Go, go, go, go!

185
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,870
We're all gonna die, aren't we?

186
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,439
Give me your hand.

187
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,239
- What?
- Give me your hand.

188
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,593
Look out!

189
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,239
- Hold on! Hold on!
- Don't let go!

190
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,876
No!

191
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,955
Pull back your line, lieutenant!

192
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,351
Weapon!

193
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,838
Let's go.

194
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,112
Bug!

195
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,633
Get down!
Move!

196
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,038
- All right, people, listen up!
- Who the hell let you out?

197
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,988
- In about 15 seconds...
- All right, you son of a bitch...

198
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,756
Shield your eyes at count zero!

199
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,273
Pass the word!

200
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,079
Get off your ass,
there's a war going on.

201
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,470
You two! With me on flank!

202
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,553
Perimeter burn in 10 seconds.

203
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,717
Perimeter burn in 10 seconds.

204
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,679
Look out!

205
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,994
Come on!

206
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,511
Three.

207
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,750
Two.

208
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,990
One.

209
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,718
Zero.

210
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,000
Perimeter burn.

211
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,953
I need two volunteers.

212
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,635
- Who do you think you are?
- The big stick that's running this show.

213
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,352
- I'll go.
- Me too.

214
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,593
If we're not back inside of five minutes,
it means more Bugs are on the way.

215
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,069
You mean we didn't kill them all?

216
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,356
You never kill them all, son.

217
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,995
All right, who's got...?

218
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,359
A light.

219
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,232
Otter, take a knee.

220
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,317
- You see those busted wires there?
- Yes, sir.

221
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,199
You got the wiggle room, kid.
Splice them together.

222
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,237
Trooper, hand me that...

223
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,996
Where's your knife?

224
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,196
I must have lost it, sir.

225
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,877
Anyone who loses his knife in my unit
would be strung up for lashes, kid.

226
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,030
You want to be careful
with the red wire.

227
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,478
We got movement!

228
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,835
Horton, illumination round.

229
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,352
Hold your fire, we're coming through!

230
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,159
It's the general.

231
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,276
I see him!
He's bringing home two.

232
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,599
He's bringing home three.

233
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,513
Wonder who didn't make it.
Hope it wasn't Goldy.

234
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,389
He was nice to me on my first day.
It's those little things that count.

235
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,676
Yeah, like doing your goddamn job.

236
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,434
Hostiles! Right on your general's ass!

237
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,477
Come on, kid!

238
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,838
Outstanding.

239
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,231
- That stinks!
- You get so you like it after a while.

240
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,710
- Son, I'll never forget it.
- Me neither, sir.

241
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,999
What kind of a-hole do you think I am?
Put her there!

242
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,752
Welcome back, sir.

243
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,912
I don't know who you are,
but you're aces with me.

244
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,555
It's nothing personal, general.
I'm just doing my job.

245
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,792
Hey, fellas, let me give you a hand.

246
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,038
Hell, I got a dog back home
weighs more than she does.

247
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,595
Well, look what the cat drug in!

248
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,755
You should see that damn cat!
We're in the shitter, huh?

249
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,990
- We got a chance.
- Good to see you.

250
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,151
Want the bad news or the bad news?

251
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,230
- I almost forgot your knife.
- Keep it, kid.

252
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,790
- No, I couldn't.
- Trooper needs a knife.

253
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,030
Officers just tell troopers
where to die.

254
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,592
- That's not really true, is it, sir?
- Watch out for officers, son.

255
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,557
It's their job to get you killed.

256
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,630
First wave came in,
and Deke and Slater were killed.

257
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,512
Came in again and that...
That kid Goldy was gone.

258
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,438
And then it was just...

259
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,634
...me and O'Hara.

260
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,997
That magnificent son of a bitch.

261
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,075
We held them.

262
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,438
I tell you, this...

263
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,915
...star don't mean a hill of beans when
you're caught between shit and sweat.

264
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,356
And then these two beautiful
bastards show up.

265
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,832
These two here, and they're carrying
a couple of grenades...

266
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,594
...and they got a boatload of gumption.

267
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,671
And they saved my sorry ass!

268
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,230
And I'd like to introduce you to them.

269
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,278
This is Corporal Joe Griff,
Medical Corps.

270
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,000
And this is Technical
Sergeant Ari Peck.

271
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,596
And I can't tell you a thing about
Sleeping Beauty over here...

272
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,799
...because she snored through
the whole damn thing.

273
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,757
That's Private Soda, sir.

274
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,480
She didn't sleep after our
unit got chopped down.

275
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,428
Found Peck the next day,
what, about five days ago?

276
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,639
Everybody's gotta sleep sometime.

277
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,038
What's your story, Peck?

278
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,433
32nd Tech Brigade,
sole survivor, sir!

279
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,919
That's me.

280
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,032
Been out there about a month,
near as I can tell.

281
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,759
That's a long time.

282
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,957
Pretty long, yeah. I guess.

283
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,157
Well, then, we got to get you home.

284
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,872
Lieutenant Dill.

285
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,793
- Yes, sir!
- Has pickup been arranged?

286
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,470
- Sergeant Peck, can I talk to you?
- Yes, sir?

287
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,553
You think you can make this com talk
and squawk like it ought to?

288
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:46,114
Well, you can bet I'll die trying, sir.

289
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,318
- Get some sleep and try later.
- Oh, no, no. I'll get on this right now.

290
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,118
That's outstanding, sergeant!

291
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,158
You're a credit to your
Mobile Infantry unit. Thank you.

292
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,515
When is the last time
you took a shower?

293
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,434
Let's worry about the sniff factor
after we get our asses unslung.

294
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,158
Yes, sir.

295
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,910
We could sit pretty tight if we could
shut this door, sergeant.

296
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,718
I'll get someone on it.

297
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,678
At least there's one man looking
in the right direction.

298
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,114
Yes, sir.

299
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,957
What's wrong with her, corporal?

300
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,749
It's the wind, sir.
Dries out the membranes.

301
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,829
- She'll be fine when she wakes up.
- She's got the right idea.

302
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,552
Good night, troopers.

303
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,597
Get some sleep, all of you!

304
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,478
That's an order.

305
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,790
- And, Dill...
- Yes, sir.

306
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,198
I want a full report of today's
action when I wake up...

307
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,113
...explaining how you got five
of my troopers killed.

308
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,838
Yes, sir.

309
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,791
You heard the man.
Hit the sack!

310
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,114
Not you, trooper.

311
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,554
Yes, sir?

312
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,269
Letting that criminal loose is a
court-martial offence, private.

313
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,873
I thought he could help us.

314
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,158
You thought the judgment of a murderer
was preferable to an officer's?

315
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,154
Well, that'll make for a hell
of a compelling defence.

316
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,311
I wasn't thinking, sir.
It was intuition.

317
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,438
Intuition?

318
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,953
I had no idea you were psychic.

319
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,554
I scored high when I was a kid, sir.

320
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,948
Really?

321
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,355
Why aren't you wearing the black?

322
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,750
I became inconsistent, sir.

323
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,516
Onset of puberty?

324
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,751
It happens to you women.

325
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,878
- When is it gonna happen to you?
- Excuse me?

326
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,716
Puberty. I hear it's a necessary step
on the way to becoming a man.

327
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,553
You're addressing an
officer of the Federation.

328
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,439
Shove that officer crap
up your Buster Brown.

329
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,750
An officer who behaves
as you did today...

330
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,798
...and takes it out
on a trooper ain't a man!

331
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,475
I'm not a man? What kind of a man
turns his back on the Federation?

332
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,039
I'm glad you asked.

333
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,875
I trained a generation of people to
throw themselves into the grinder.

334
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,600
The Federation chewed them up
and spit them out.

335
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,548
So now when they say, " Push on
to glory," I say, "What glory?"

336
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,679
What would you know about glory?
You call yourself a hero?

337
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,119
No, son. That's something other people
call you, and it's really just a trick.

338
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,558
When you throw your life away, instead
of fool, they call you hero.

339
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,635
And as for glory, ask her. She'll
tell you everything you need to know!

340
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,188
How dare you?

341
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,838
Just one man's opinion.

342
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,594
No, it's not. It's treason!

343
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,390
Then maybe you ought to shoot me.

344
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,437
Now, there's something
we agree on.

345
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,910
Well, go ahead. Take out that
popgun and have at it, soldier.

346
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:24,110
I believe in the rules and regulations
that the Federation stands for.

347
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,157
Very good, lieutenant!

348
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,197
But you left out the kids.

349
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,237
- What?
- Cowards.

350
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,433
They always hide behind
rules and children.

351
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,436
I'll see you hang!

352
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,717
Just so long as it's regulation rope.

353
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,999
Oh, let's see.

354
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,675
Got your mystery meat sticks,
egg caps, hardtack, beans.

355
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,628
Insta-veggie meal,
Choco-pudding Delite.

356
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,236
Sweet tooth, huh?

357
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,438
Taps in 15 minutes.

358
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,831
I'll get you!

359
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,519
Nice to have you with us, trooper.

360
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,437
You've been out for a long time.
How you feeling?

361
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,597
I feel good, sir.

362
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,153
You fit for duty?

363
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,677
Raring to go.

364
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,275
Well, that's outstanding.

365
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,599
What's the ETA on a door
we can shut, gentlemen?

366
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,594
Well, sir, I think that should do it.

367
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,228
If you'll hold on...

368
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,470
- Watch out for the cables!
- The cables. Stop it! Stop it!

369
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,471
Do it, do it, do it.

370
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,555
Shit.

371
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,156
Great, you welded
the damn thing open.

372
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,548
You idiots.

373
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,914
All personnel to the perimeter.

374
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,479
Troopers, you heard the man.
Let's go!

375
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,234
Get moving!
Take that weapon. Come on.

376
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,631
Sandee, Horton, Soda, Brick,
come on, you lazy bastards.

377
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,110
Let's move it.
Move, move, move, move!

378
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,199
Sahara.

379
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,751
You two over there, you two
front and running. Where's my OP?

380
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,471
Man your post! Go, go, go!

381
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,989
- What's wrong?
- General, there's something...

382
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,388
Move!

383
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,318
Scouting parties, sir, 100 metres out.

384
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,436
When they figure
that fence is down...

385
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,309
...they're gonna show up like relatives
to a rich man's funeral.

386
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,509
- Let there be light.
- Yeah.

387
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,111
- Yeah!
- Here we go. We got power.

388
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,153
That's what I'm talking about.
I can see you now.

389
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,880
Hey, general?

390
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,192
- Peck, is this your doing?
- It's a little wonky...

391
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,113
...but it'll hold. I hope.

392
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,350
You have our tremendous
gratitude, Peck.

393
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,035
Oh, it was nothing, sir.

394
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,751
I'll get back to work on the com now.

395
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,990
- Attaboy, Peck.
- Way to go, Peck.

396
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,790
Peck. Peck. Peck.

397
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,951
All right.

398
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,115
Dax, the charges
against you are serious...

399
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,158
...but I can't afford to lose a man
of your experience.

400
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,477
Give me your word
as an officer you'll do your duty.

401
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,759
I'm no longer an officer, general,
but I'll give you my word as a man.

402
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,151
Your rank is restored
until your guilt or innocence...

403
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,117
...is determined by a hearing.

404
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,318
Well, I can assure you
I killed Colonel Hohlback.

405
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,877
Then I guarantee you'll hang, but until
then, I expect you to do your duty.

406
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,634
- Yes, sir.
- I want forward OP.

407
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,916
Three watches a day.

408
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,277
Fences fail, troopers get lazy.

409
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,398
- You carry on, captain.
- Yes, sir.

410
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,753
Something I can do for you?

411
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,953
I just came to say thanks
for saving my ass.

412
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,196
That's the job.

413
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,517
How come you don't sleep inside
like everyone else?

414
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,553
I figure this is where
the enemy will show up.

415
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,350
No telling what kind of fun
you could get in out here, huh?

416
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,998
- Are you flirting with me, soldier?
- No, sir, I don't flirt.

417
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,273
- Never?
- Never ever, sir.

418
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,192
- Well, you're the real deal.
- The genuine article.

419
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,560
And you want some action.

420
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,916
You'll get all the action you want
after the Bugs show up.

421
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,991
You know...

422
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,910
...it's all the waiting that gets me.

423
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,155
Oh, I see.

424
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,717
You need something
to occupy your mind.

425
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,072
Come here.

426
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,754
That's good right there.
Drop and give me 100.

427
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,239
- Sir?
- You got a lot of energy, trooper.

428
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,836
Now get down and start counting.

429
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,150
Yes, sir.

430
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,076
One, two, three, four...

431
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,715
...five, six, seven...

432
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,399
Make it 200.

433
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,069
You lose something?

434
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,273
Yo, you're the new guy, so l...

435
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,719
Can we play too?

436
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,396
I got mess duty.

437
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,552
- Thanks for the wake up, Soda.
- Pleasure.

438
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,277
You sure you know
what you're doing?

439
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,989
Oh, I got a pretty good idea, but...

440
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,589
...you know,
practice does make perfect.

441
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,354
Nice.

442
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,511
Come on, Billie.

443
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,550
No, no, forget it, Sandee. He's a jerk.

444
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,110
Hey, Sandee...

445
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,350
- What's with her?
- Horton's with the new girl.

446
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,953
- Sipping some Soda.
- Ain't war hell?

447
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,160
Who goes there?

448
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,356
Horton?

449
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,230
Oh, it's you.

450
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,996
Sorry.

451
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,798
You okay?

452
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,155
No.

453
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,597
- Anything I can do?
- No.

454
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,319
At least let me take a look
at that cut on your chin.

455
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,080
This? It's just a scratch.

456
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,636
General wants everybody tiptop.

457
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,190
- Hey, Joe?
- Yeah?

458
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,193
How long have you been out here?

459
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,592
- All my life, it seems like.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

460
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,435
I've been here for eight months,
and I've only seen the sun twice.

461
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,117
Might be a little easier
if you took your helmet off, Jill.

462
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,112
God, what happened to your fingers?

463
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,955
- You know, muzzle burn.
- That looks really bad.

464
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,715
Hey, who's the medic here
anyway, huh?

465
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,270
Hey, Joe.

466
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,793
Yeah?

467
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,679
Has anybody ever told you
what a nice smile you have?

468
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,431
Yeah.

469
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,798
Probably.

470
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,276
Feeling better?

471
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,911
No.

472
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,952
Do you want to?

473
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,358
- What happened to her, corporal?
- Just a nosebleed, sir.

474
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,431
She's gonna be fine.

475
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,910
- How do you feel?
- You know how I feel.

476
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,236
What gives?

477
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,994
It looks like we got
a couple new couples.

478
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,948
No wonder we're losing this war.
Everyone's fucking instead of fighting.

479
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,955
What are you looking at?

480
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,317
- Get back to work.
- I'll get to work.

481
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,433
- Good morning, captain.
- What makes you think so?

482
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,670
Why, are we in for it?

483
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:38,231
- Sooner or later.
- You got time for breakfast?

484
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,713
You're welcome to join me, as long as
you don't expect cheerful conversation.

485
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,075
Not a morning person, huh?

486
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,232
No, I'm a miserable, murdering bastard.

487
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,960
- And that's on a good day.
- What's a bad day like?

488
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,078
Any one day in particular
you're interested in?

489
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,878
No.

490
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,315
That second lieu-y
send you to question me?

491
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,711
- Lieutenant Dill? He thinks I'm an idiot.
- Are you?

492
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,271
- Me? Yeah. Definitely.
- Trust me, I got you beat.

493
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:16,429
Well, I fell in love, and I got busted
down from corporal for fraternisation.

494
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,593
- So who wants to be a corporal?
- Here's the idiot part.

495
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,432
He got killed.

496
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,748
You really some kind of psychic?

497
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,233
Yeah. Maybe. I guess.
Not like Dill, not Psi Corps.

498
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,589
Well, your fella...

499
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,390
...did you know he was gonna
buy the farm?

500
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,949
It doesn't work that way.

501
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,712
Well, that's good, I guess.

502
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,111
Maybe that's why I don't
believe in all that bunk.

503
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,233
Those tags belong
to the troopers that you lost...

504
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,035
...and you wear them because you feel
responsible for what happened.

505
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,515
That's a lucky guess.

506
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,990
- Why'd you kill your CO?
- You tell me.

507
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,435
I'm not that good.

508
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,628
He gave some stupid orders
that got kids killed.

509
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,831
One day too many,
or too many one day.

510
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,356
- Maybe I'm the wheel that broke.
- You ought to forgive yourself.

511
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,511
It's war.

512
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,274
Don't spend too much time
around me, trooper.

513
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,512
I'd hate to end up wearing your tags.

514
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,994
Stupid Bug.

515
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,639
You're relieved.

516
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,791
Thanks.

517
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,594
Hey... Hey, trooper?

518
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,877
Who's that?

519
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,156
Peck.

520
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,229
Hey, sarge, what do you need?

521
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,756
Well, I could use a hand.

522
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,112
Buddy, anything I can do
for you is aces by me.

523
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:54,350
You think you could
lie down on the fl...?

524
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:59,196
- The floor?
- Floor. And reach behind the cons...

525
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,672
I got it, I got it. You want me to lay on
the floor and reach behind the console.

526
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,792
Okay.

527
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,911
Here we go.

528
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,516
Son of a...

529
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,111
How's this?

530
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,675
Oh, God!

531
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,552
Help!

532
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,552
Gotta keep quiet.

533
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,554
Help! Help!

534
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,679
We got com.

535
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,996
We got com.

536
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,917
This is Hotel Delta 185 to Fleet Rescue.

537
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,310
Come in, Fleet Rescue.

538
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,076
This is Hotel Delta 185 to Fleet Rescue.

539
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,710
- This is...
- How's that report coming?

540
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,994
Well, I'm not so much writing a report
as building your gallows, Dax.

541
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,835
- I didn't take you for a carpenter.
- Shift to Command frequency.

542
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,037
There was this other carpenter
a few thousand years ago...

543
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,555
...a better man than you or me.

544
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,871
Well, that carpentry business
was the death of him.

545
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,078
Be careful of what you build
and what crosses you bear.

546
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,994
- Hotel Delta 185 to Fleet Command.
- Lieutenant.

547
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,279
Roger, Hotel Delta,
this is Fleet Command. Over.

548
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:21,070
This is the 701 st Mobile Infantry,
Bravo Company, requesting pickup.

549
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,511
Tak e a number, MI.
We got stragglers all over the planet.

550
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,076
- What's your name, sailor?
- Fleet Lieutenant Mary Klinghof.

551
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,829
- Getting smart won't help you, jarhead.
- You listen up, fruit fly.

552
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,195
This is General Jack Gordon Shepherd.

553
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,397
And if somebody doesn't make
this pickup their priority...

554
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,074
...I'm gonna make it
my priority to come down...

555
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,800
...and chew out some Fleet-ass,
starting with you.

556
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,032
Sorry, sir, I didn't know
who I was talking to.

557
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,470
- That's because you're a moron.
- Yeah.

558
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,313
Yes, sir, but we got
a lot of wounded out there.

559
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,189
The wounded come first. Any excuses
after that come out of your butt.

560
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,476
Shepherd, out.

561
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,070
Where's Peck?
I'm gonna give him a medal.

562
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,152
- Asleep, sir. Dead on his feet.
- Well, he's earned it.

563
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,916
- Any day on that door, Brick.
- We're all waiting for something, sarge.

564
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,269
- But it ain't the door.
- Outstanding.

565
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,356
Not you, trooper.

566
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,835
- Lucky guess.
- We're all gonna die.

567
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,192
- What would you know about glory?
- It doesn't work that way.

568
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,038
- Lf he won't fight, shoot him!
- No!

569
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,912
- Sahara.
- I haven't seen him.

570
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,150
- Wak e up.
- The wheel that brok e.

571
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,671
Wak e up.

572
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,195
Wak e up.

573
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,393
Give me a little more.
Don't be shy. Come on.

574
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,597
Yeah. Oh, trouble at the trough.

575
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,876
It's gonna get ugly.

576
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,476
- What's eating Tor, huh?
- Not you.

577
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:05,595
Yeah, I guess you're right.
War does some weird things to people.

578
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,438
Everything okay?

579
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,837
No, I'm... Yeah, I'm fine.

580
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:02,195
- You look a little shaky, trooper.
- Yeah, something's not right.

581
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,318
That's what they call it
when you're behind enemy lines.

582
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,311
It feels worse than that.

583
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,313
Oh, is this another one
of your psychic hot flashes?

584
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,357
It seems like Tor has changed.

585
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:15,193
Because he wouldn't take
Brick's bait? About time.

586
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,830
- It seems sudden, sarge.
- Like you puking your guts out?

587
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,514
I guess I'm coming down
with something.

588
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,399
- I wonder what that could be?
- There's a big knot...

589
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,152
...where my stomach used to be.

590
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,029
Sarge, I barely touched the medic's
hand just now, and I saw something.

591
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,033
- You saw something?
- Something terrible.

592
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,439
- Maybe you're just going crazy.
- I love you too, sarge.

593
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,796
Girls get wacky
when they're pregnant.

594
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,231
Suddenly, they know everything
about everything.

595
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,119
Oh, Jesus.

596
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,156
Yeah, you're about as psychic
as a doorknob, trooper.

597
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,517
You ready?

598
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:31,549
I'm kind of tired.

599
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,555
- I'll give you a hand.
- Oh, thanks.

600
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,075
Oh, my shoe.

601
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,390
Don't worry about it.

602
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,668
- Are you scared to shower, Otter?
- What does it matter?

603
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,553
We're going home
in a few hours anyway.

604
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,553
Hi, guys.

605
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,438
Holy God, what the...?

606
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,154
Oh, God. Oh, God.

607
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,589
Open the door! Open the door!
We're gonna die in here!

608
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,910
Open the door!

609
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,917
Captain, I need to talk to you,
but it's gonna sound crazy.

610
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,315
- Well, spit it out, trooper.
- Look, sir...

611
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,153
...I know I'm not really
supposed to be psychic...

612
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,276
...but I have this terrible feeling.

613
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,713
- Yes, sir.
- As you were.

614
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:56,954
We have a situation here that requires
the attention of Military Intelligence.

615
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,948
- Tell him.
- This morning, in the mess...

616
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,635
...I accidentally touched Griff's hand.
I might've had a vision.

617
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,236
Playing psychic again, private?

618
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,834
Could you keep
an open mind here, lieutenant?

619
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,309
This trooper's
got information that's vital.

620
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,956
Some of the troopers have been
acting a little strange lately.

621
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,872
Describe what you saw.

622
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,395
He wasn't a man.
He was some other thing.

623
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,120
Maybe 1000 things.
Somehow he was connected...

624
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:32,070
...to Tor and Sandee and Horton
and that new girl, Soda.

625
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,995
I've always been pretty fuzzy, sir,
and this came through sharp as a knife.

626
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,233
Lieutenant, I know I'm not
a real psychic like you.

627
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:45,279
In fact, I just found out
I'm pregnant, and I didn't have a clue.

628
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,711
- You're pregnant?
- Yes, sir, I'm afraid so.

629
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,718
You might be interested to know
that in our studies...

630
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,429
...pregnancy has been shown
to heighten psychic ability.

631
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,637
That's too bad because
I'd really like to be wrong.

632
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:06,312
Yes, me too, but I keep having
the same feeling.

633
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,755
What is it?

634
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,876
They're coming to wipe us out.

635
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,713
What's so new about that?

636
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:19,075
I mean the whole species, everything
human. And they have a plan.

637
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:23,550
Look, after what I did in the battle...

638
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,280
...I wasn't very sure
of myself anymore.

639
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,353
And I just figured everybody
thought I'd just cracked.

640
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,393
Yesterday, I might have been
inclined to agree...

641
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,876
...but that would've been me
screwing up, lieutenant.

642
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,396
Thank you, sir.

643
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,834
I'll get on this matter
with General Shepherd immediately.

644
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,992
Oh, and, trooper...

645
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,196
...that was some good work.

646
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,237
Sir.

647
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,795
General Shepherd?

648
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,835
What are you doing in here?

649
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,518
General Jack and I
were just having a chat.

650
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,830
What are you doing here, Dill?

651
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,797
You and Shepherd?

652
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,476
Is that so hard to believe?

653
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,477
General?

654
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,313
General Shepherd?

655
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,397
General...

656
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:27,397
They're inside of you. Oh, God.

657
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,358
Back up, or I'll drill your damn skull.

658
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,949
Get back! Get away from the door.

659
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,639
Get away.

660
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:43,669
You bastards. You're all under arrest...

661
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:48,277
...for murder, sedition,
for treason against the Federation...

662
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:52,117
Oh, and you're gonna pay
because we're not gonna kill you.

663
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:56,313
Oh, no. No, you see, we got
special places for things like you...

664
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,038
...where they cut you up.

665
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,668
But they keep you alive
while they cut you up...

666
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:05,630
...so they can see what makes you tick,
and they'll see what makes you sick.

667
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:11,597
And I'll be there. Oh, yeah,
I'm gonna be there to see...

668
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,434
You're under arrest, Dax.

669
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,670
On what charge?

670
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,558
Murder.

671
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:58,111
- Captain Dax, what's happening?
- No talking to the prisoner.

672
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:10,955
Keep him covered.
You gave me your word, Dax.

673
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:14,994
What makes you think I had
anything to do with this, general?

674
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,868
- Lock him up, sergeant.
- Yes, sir. With pleasure, sir.

675
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:37,316
- Get out of here now, Sahara.
- Move it.

676
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,910
You know what to do, Billie.

677
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,116
Yes, sir.

678
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,718
Why are you doing this, Billie?

679
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,549
It's not you and me.
It's gonna happen to all of us.

680
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,596
You trying to make a baby
with my barracks door, private?

681
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:29,078
Sahara, she don't want it,
but I gotta give her the Bug.

682
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:34,360
- There's a wire loose in your head.
- No, it's a little piece of God.

683
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:38,399
Not like the one people used
to believe in, or the Federation...

684
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:44,478
...and it's filling me up. I can sort
of feel myself floating away.

685
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,478
Kid, you're not making any sense.

686
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,758
You'll understand when you wake up.

687
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,480
When I wake up?

688
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:03,511
- Don't fight.
- That'll be the day.

689
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,951
No!

690
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,515
You Ionely, captain?

691
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,833
Billie, please don't. Please.

692
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,075
What the hell's going on, sergeant?

693
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:38,677
- The Bugs are inside, sir.
- Inside the perimeter?

694
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,472
No, sir.

695
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,712
Inside me.

696
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,275
Sergeant, no! No!

697
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,153
Keys.

698
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,315
- What the hell kind of Bug is that?
- Jesus.

699
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,555
One that gets inside and takes over.
Maybe it can tell us something.

700
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,991
What are you talking about?

701
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,957
Everything that happened here
was supposed to happen.

702
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,549
The Bugs brought us here
to create a weapon.

703
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,593
- What kind of weapon?
- Shepherd!

704
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,390
He could bring this
to the top of the Federation!

705
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,393
We gotta kill the general.

706
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:07,991
Fire in the hole!

707
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,674
You're gonna die!

708
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,956
They don't kill so easy, do they?

709
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,549
- You're gonna die!
- They're not like us, sir.

710
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:25,877
Not anymore. They're Bugs.

711
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:33,672
You're gonna die!
You're gonna die!

712
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,750
They shut down the reactors.

713
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,714
Sandee?

714
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,912
Grenade!

715
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,631
Sahara, you okay?

716
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,752
Poor creatures.

717
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,714
Why must we destroy you?

718
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,472
I'll tell you why.

719
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,595
Order is the tide of creation...

720
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,714
...but yours is a species...

721
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,555
...that worships the one over the many.

722
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:34,032
You glorify your intelligence...

723
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:38,113
...because it allows you
to believe anything.

724
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,030
That you have a destiny.

725
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,310
That you have a right.

726
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:47,150
That you have a cause.

727
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,870
That you are special.

728
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,831
That you are great.

729
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,871
But in truth...

730
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,838
...you are born insane.

731
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,154
And such misery...

732
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:07,354
...cannot be allowed...

733
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,430
...to spread.

734
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,393
Kill them all!

735
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,548
Sahara! You get the general!

736
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,039
- General Shepherd!
- That's me!

737
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:36,677
You can't take him! Whatever you do,
don't let him onboard!

738
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,196
Hey, general!

739
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,229
Listen up. She needs medical attention.

740
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,709
You just killed
a general officer, mister!

741
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,314
Lots of generals out there, flyboy!

742
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:13,275
This trooper's got information vital
to the survival of the Federation!

743
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,398
She must reach safety at all costs!
You get me?

744
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,113
Yes, sir!

745
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,669
- Let's go!
- There are too many of them, Dax!

746
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:27,594
You gotta tell them what you saw.
You gotta tell them about the new Bug!

747
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,392
You stay here, you'll die!

748
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,158
Murderers don't go home.

749
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,594
Dax!

750
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,990
Dax!

751
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,629
Dax. More than a soldier,
not just a man.

752
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,637
A hero of the Federation.

753
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,153
He gave his life so we could fight...

754
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,590
...and these words for us to live by:

755
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:48,834
"Shed no tears for me.
My glory lives forever."

756
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,949
And now you too can live the glory...

757
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:07,874
...because it's easy to be a hero
in the Mobile Infantry.

758
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,600
Men and women lik e you
are signing up every day...

759
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:13,638
...to serve the Federation
and save the galaxy!

760
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,711
Isn't it time you did your part?

761
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,279
Beautiful baby, ma'am.

762
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,634
Thank you, sergeant.

763
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,400
Think how impressed friends
and teachers will be!

764
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,834
Everyone loves a citizen!

765
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,319
Little trooper likes me.

766
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,080
Sign up, and one day
they'll call you a hero too!

767
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:31,755
Hurry up, spud.
We need fresh meat for the grinder.

768
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:49,390
Shed no tears for me.
My glory lives forever.

769
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:48,549
