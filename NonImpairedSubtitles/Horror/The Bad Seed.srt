1
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:47,889
- Be right out, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

2
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:57,099
- The car's here, sweetheart.
- All right, darling.

3
00:02:08,278 --> 00:02:09,870
Rhoda.

4
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,008
Rhododendron, pal.

5
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:16,412
That's a mighty pretty piece.

6
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:18,852
It's Au Clair De La Lune, Daddy.

7
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:21,390
In English, that means
"By the Light of the Moon."

8
00:02:21,457 --> 00:02:22,890
I hate to tune you off.

9
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,189
Have you got time
to say goodbye to your old man?

10
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:27,092
Of course, Daddy.

11
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,158
Will you write Mother every day?

12
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:33,201
I'll write both my girls every day.

13
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:35,464
And will you put in a special page
just for me?

14
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:39,099
She has to have a very special page
all her own, you know.

15
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:42,144
A special page with lots of X's.

16
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:46,244
Monica, how nice.

17
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:49,149
Yes, here's your effusive landlady
from upstairs, darlings...

18
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:50,379
come to say goodbye.

19
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:52,387
No life of my own,
so I need other people's.

20
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:54,548
I speak for my brother Emory
as well as myself.

21
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:56,854
He had to go to the train
to meet Reginald Tasker.

22
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,292
He's the speaker
at our Psychiatry Club this evening.

23
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:01,853
Emory never gets a chance
to speak when I'm around.

24
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,365
I've talked enough.
You say something, Colonel.

25
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,631
It will just have to be goodbye, Monica.
I'm taking off.

26
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:09,604
Do something about not having a war.

27
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:12,505
I'm not ready to be turned
into a piece of chalk just yet.

28
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:14,873
By gum, I'll try.

29
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,469
You said "by gum" because I'm here.

30
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:19,140
You're right. I did.

31
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:21,012
Don't worry about your two darlings.

32
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:24,247
If either of them begins to look peaked,
I'll send up smoke signals.

33
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,344
Thanks, Monica.

34
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:26,911
Rhoda, dear, let's stay here...

35
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,220
so Mommy and Daddy can say goodbye
by themselves.

36
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,487
Besides, I have a surprise for you.

37
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:32,755
Presents?

38
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,091
Rhoda!

39
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:37,860
All right.
I'll take my goodbye present here.

40
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:39,090
Now.

41
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:41,796
What will you give me if I give you
a basket of kisses?

42
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:44,169
I'll give you a basket of hugs.

43
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:46,735
I'll miss your hugs.

44
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:51,207
I'll miss your kisses, Daddy.

45
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:53,112
You're so big and strong.

46
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:55,082
See my effect on girls?

47
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,584
Goodbye now, sweetheart.

48
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,883
- Take care of Mommy?
- I will, Daddy.

49
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,119
- Goodbye, Monica.
- Goodbye.

50
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:03,852
Come on, darling.

51
00:04:09,232 --> 00:04:11,757
What have you got for me, Aunt Monica?

52
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,563
Let's see if you can guess.

53
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:16,127
- Good morning, Sergeant.
- Good morning, Mrs. Penmark.

54
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:17,900
Thanks, Sergeant.

55
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:20,704
Darling, when you see Daddy
in Washington...

56
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:22,711
will you have him come
and pay me a visit?

57
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:24,076
Sure, I will.

58
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:25,976
Kenneth.

59
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,613
- We've lived through this before.
- I know it.

60
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,480
I'm just not in any mood
to shout hooray, that's all.

61
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:35,250
Smile, girl.

62
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,155
My girl?

63
00:04:37,226 --> 00:04:39,717
Yes, for ever and ever.

64
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:54,999
Bye, darling.

65
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:13,394
Look, Mommy!

66
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:17,131
Monica, what have you given her now?

67
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,031
It's a pair of dark glasses...

68
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:21,400
to keep the sun
out of those pretty blue eyes...

69
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:23,871
and the rhinestones to frame them in.

70
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,535
My, who is this
glamorous Hollywood actress?

71
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:29,610
I like them.

72
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,605
- Where's the case?
- Here it is, dear.

73
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,451
Didn't you ever
hear about spoiling people?

74
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:39,749
Nonsense!

75
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,920
Now here's something else.

76
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,924
This was given to me
when I was 8 years old.

77
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:48,088
It's a little young for me now.

78
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,226
But it's still just right for an 8-year-old.

79
00:05:52,802 --> 00:05:54,702
Monica...

80
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,740
I just don't know
what I'm going to do with you.

81
00:05:58,141 --> 00:05:59,870
However, there's a garnet set in it...

82
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,069
so we'll have to change
that for a turquoise...

83
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:04,545
since turquoise is your birthstone.

84
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:06,739
Could I have both stones?

85
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,349
- The garnet, too?
- Rhoda.

86
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,012
What a way to behave...

87
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:15,319
Why, certainly you may, of course.

88
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:19,350
How wonderful to meet
such a natural little girl.

89
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,260
She knows what she wants,
and she asks for it.

90
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:24,492
Not like these overcivilized little pets...

91
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:26,159
that have to go through analysis...

92
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:28,726
before they can choose an ice-cream soda.

93
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,263
Dear, sweet Aunt Monica.

94
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:34,899
Darling, I know I'm behind the times...

95
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,707
but I thought children wore blue jeans...

96
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,645
or playsuits to picnics.

97
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:43,811
You, my love, look like a princess
in that red-and-white dotted Swiss.

98
00:06:43,886 --> 00:06:46,081
Tell me, aren't you afraid
you'll get it dirty...

99
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,214
or that you'll fall
and scuff those new shoes?

100
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:52,323
She won't soil the dress,
and she won't scuff the shoes.

101
00:06:52,395 --> 00:06:53,885
Rhoda never gets anything dirty...

102
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:57,228
although how she manages it,
I don't know.

103
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,492
I don't like blue jeans. They're not...

104
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,938
You mean blue jeans are not
quite ladylike, don't you, my darling?

105
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,340
You sweet, old-fashioned little dear.

106
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:11,705
Am I to keep this now?

107
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:15,376
You're to keep it until I can find out
where to get the stone changed.

108
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:17,009
I'll put it in my treasure drawer.

109
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:21,113
Rhoda, we'll be leaving in a few minutes.
Is your room all straightened?

110
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,623
Yes, Mother.

111
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,751
Unnecessary question.

112
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,360
LeRoy.

113
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:30,562
LeRoy.

114
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,357
Yes, Miss Breedlove?

115
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:34,960
What on earth do you think you're doing?

116
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,164
I'm just trying to hurry
with my chores, ma'am.

117
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,901
Ring first and wait.

118
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:41,535
If nobody answers, then use your key.

119
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:51,386
Morning, Mrs. Penmark.
I left my chamois and pail...

120
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:53,479
doing the inside windows yesterday.

121
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:56,956
Very well, LeRoy. They're in the bathroom.

122
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:00,929
Does he always crash in that way?

123
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:05,331
Only when we're up and about, I think,
trying to prove his individualism.

124
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,096
LeRoy doesn't mean any harm.

125
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,401
He has the mind of a child,
but he's managed to produce a family...

126
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:11,838
so I keep him on.

127
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,432
Monica.

128
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:19,280
Good morning, Miss Uppity.

129
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:22,946
When I was in school,
we didn't have no picnics.

130
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,118
I don't care what you didn't have.

131
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:30,285
We'll go right along, dear.

132
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:33,157
I just want to write
this tuition check for Miss Fern.

133
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:34,457
Yes, Mother.

134
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,705
Excuse me.

135
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,709
You sound like Fred Astaire
tap-tapping across the room.

136
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,810
What have you got on your shoes?

137
00:08:57,887 --> 00:08:59,616
I run over my heels...

138
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:01,850
and Mother had these iron pieces
put on them...

139
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:03,414
so they'd last longer.

140
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:05,619
I'm afraid I can't take any credit.

141
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:07,686
It was Rhoda's idea entirely.

142
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:11,132
I think they're very nice. They save money.

143
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,691
You penurious little sweetheart.

144
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:17,499
You think of everything,
take everything so much to heart.

145
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,906
That's one reason why I thought
you should have some presents today.

146
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:26,512
You wanted to win that
penmanship medal very much, didn't you?

147
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:31,518
It's the only gold medal Miss Fern gives,
and it was really mine!

148
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:35,590
Everybody knew I wrote the best hand,
and I should have had it.

149
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,528
I just don't see how Claude Daigle
got the medal.

150
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:41,460
Rhoda.

151
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,294
These things happen to us all the time...

152
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:47,668
and when they do, we simply accept them.

153
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:51,570
Now, I've told you, darling, try to forget it.

154
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:55,934
I'm sorry. I know you don't like
people pawing over you.

155
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,446
It was mine! The medal was mine!

156
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,513
Have you completely lost your senses?

157
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:10,991
- Look at Rhoda's shoes.
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Breedlove...

158
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,618
but she had to come running out...

159
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,458
- just as I was...
- LeRoy!

160
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,758
Sorry, ma'am.

161
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:17,958
LeRoy, I own this apartment house.

162
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,467
I employ you...

163
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,698
I've given you the benefit of every doubt
because you have a family.

164
00:10:22,772 --> 00:10:24,797
I've thought of you
as emotionally immature...

165
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,241
torn by irrational rages,
a bit on the psychopathic side.

166
00:10:28,344 --> 00:10:31,973
But after this demonstration,
I think my diagnosis was entirely too mild.

167
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,540
You're definitely a schizophrenic
with paranoid overtones.

168
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:38,314
I've had quite enough
of your discourtesy and surliness...

169
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,446
and so have the tenants in my building.

170
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:42,354
My brother has wanted to discharge you.

171
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:44,723
- I've taken your side despite misgivings...
- Monica...

172
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:46,625
- I shall protect you no longer...
- Monica.

173
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:48,596
He didn't mean it. It was an accident.

174
00:10:48,664 --> 00:10:52,122
- Sure, it was...
- He meant to do it. I know LeRoy.

175
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:53,828
It was no accident, Christine.

176
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,667
It was deliberate,
the spiteful act of a neurotic child.

177
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,899
He meant to do it.

178
00:10:57,973 --> 00:10:59,907
You watched out of the corner
of your eyes.

179
00:10:59,975 --> 00:11:03,103
- Rhoda, I want you...
- You made up your mind in one second!

180
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:04,942
I never. I'm just clumsy!

181
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:08,441
My patience is at an end,
and you might as well know it.

182
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:10,144
Get about your work!

183
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,446
It's much too lovely a morning
for such tirades.

184
00:11:14,523 --> 00:11:17,014
Now, don't forget our luncheon
with Reggie Tasker.

185
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,357
Dear me. I haven't put in my order yet.

186
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,259
What do you feed a criminologist?

187
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,766
- Prussic acid, blue vitriol, ground glass.
- Hot weather things.

188
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:26,165
Nothing would hurt Reggie.

189
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:29,671
He thrives on buckets of blood
and sudden death.

190
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:33,501
Goodbye, dear.
Have a wonderful, happy day.

191
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:35,407
Goodbye, Aunt Monica.

192
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:53,155
That know-it-all Monica Breedlove.

193
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:55,557
Don't think nobody knows anything
but her.

194
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:59,665
Well, she ain't got long to go anyway.

195
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:02,969
Old heifer's about ready for the canners.

196
00:12:05,408 --> 00:12:08,206
But that young, trough-fed Mrs. Penmark...

197
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:14,076
she might get kind of Ionesome
with that soldier boy of hers gone.

198
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,480
Yes, sir, she might.

199
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:20,716
Yeah, that Rhoda's a real smart one.

200
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:23,191
That's a smart little gal.

201
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,989
She's almost as smart as I am.

202
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:30,722
She sees through me,
and I see through her.

203
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:33,961
Swallow me a frog, but she's smart.

204
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:54,812
Jenny Fürst, you come back here!

205
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,290
- I want to see...
- You're not to go near the water.

206
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,590
Now remember, everybody.
You are not to go out on that pier...

207
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:02,392
or near the boathouse!

208
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:09,932
- Why, Mrs. Penmark. How splendid.
- Good morning, Miss Fern.

209
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:13,099
- Good morning, Miss Fern.
- Good morning, Rhoda.

210
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:15,837
- That was a perfect curtsy.
- Thank you.

211
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:19,677
You run along with the others.
I want to speak to Miss Fern for a minute.

212
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:22,615
- Yes, Mother.
- That is, if you have a minute.

213
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:25,119
Well, we're rather rushed this morning.

214
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:26,882
But, of course, Mrs. Penmark...

215
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:29,857
shall we talk while I place
the favors on the tables?

216
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:31,517
Yes, of course.

217
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,854
By the way, Miss Fern...

218
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:37,758
I have the check here for the last quarter.
Here it is.

219
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,357
Why, thank you.

220
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,061
Now, about Rhoda, naturally...

221
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:46,138
Tell me frankly, Miss Fern...

222
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:50,736
is she always as perfect in everything
as she was in her curtsy?

223
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:54,973
She does everything extremely well,
as you must know better than I.

224
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,815
And as a person,
does she fit in well at the school?

225
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:02,119
Let me think. In what way, Mrs. Penmark?

226
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:03,818
Rhoda's been...

227
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:06,793
I don't quite know how to say it...

228
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:10,559
but there's a mature quality about her
that's disturbing in a child...

229
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:13,500
and my husband and I
thought that a school like yours...

230
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:17,471
where you believe in discipline
and the old-fashioned virtues...

231
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,135
might perhaps teach her
to be more of a child.

232
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,804
Yes, I know what you mean.

233
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:26,871
Do the other children like her?
Is she popular?

234
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,050
The other children?

235
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,852
Of course, Mrs. Penmark.

236
00:14:33,556 --> 00:14:35,854
I really should get things started.

237
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,195
- Will you excuse me, please?
- Yes, of course, and thank you.

238
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:54,137
But I did meet him. But I did meet Freud!

239
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:58,304
Nobody ever believes me when I tell them
that I met Sigmund Freud.

240
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,508
They just don't believe
that you're old enough, little sister.

241
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:04,484
Anyway, it wasn't Dr. Freud
who analyzed me.

242
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:07,784
It was Dr. Kettlebaum in London.

243
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,856
Monica's been spread out on couches
from New York to Los Angeles.

244
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,092
And what was Kettlebaum's verdict?

245
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,099
He said my whole trouble
was associating ideas...

246
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,896
with words and names.

247
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:23,204
My marriage to Fred Breedlove,
for example.

248
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:26,274
He said I married Fred
because of the combination of ideas...

249
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,276
suggested by his name.

250
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:30,776
The last syllable, "love"...

251
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,241
romantic, eternal...

252
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:35,779
and the first syllable...

253
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:39,386
That is rather obvious, isn't it?

254
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:44,220
- The result of the analysis?
- It broke up my marriage.

255
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:48,786
When I explained it to Mr. Breedlove,
he became so confused...

256
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:52,027
between his first syllable
and his last syllable...

257
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:53,796
that he just gave up.

258
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:56,833
Let's sit over there,
so we can get away from analysis.

259
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:58,202
At least be comfortable.

260
00:15:58,273 --> 00:16:01,299
Yes, come on, Reggie.
Entertain us with your latest work.

261
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:05,245
What is your bloodthirsty scribbling
about to disclose now?

262
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,373
I've been making a collection of data
on Mrs. Allison.

263
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:10,652
News Budget wants an article on her.

264
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,620
You mean that practical nurse
who killed all those people?

265
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:18,023
My, yes. That simply fascinating,
paranoidal female.

266
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:22,556
Listen, Christine.

267
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,798
Mrs. Allison was
a quite definite personality.

268
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:32,940
She did away with nine patients...

269
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:36,942
for the life insurance,
with almost as many different poisons.

270
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,476
You read about her
in the papers, Mrs. Penmark?

271
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,876
Only hastily, I must say.

272
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:46,910
I'm afraid I shy away
from reading about such things.

273
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:50,023
Now that's an interesting psychic block.

274
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:54,418
Why would Christine
dislike reading about murders?

275
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:57,727
I don't know. I just have an aversion
to violence of any kind.

276
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,031
I even hate the revolver
Kenneth keeps locked in the house.

277
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:05,005
Do you dislike the revolver
more than the poison?

278
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:06,837
I just hate them both.

279
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:09,737
Maybe if you try saying the first thing...

280
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:13,304
that comes into your mind,
we can get at the root anxiety.

281
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:16,748
Just say it,
no matter how silly it seems to you.

282
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:19,447
Tell your story, Reggie,
and Christine will associate.

283
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:21,614
- What nonsense.
- What do you mean, "associate"?

284
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:25,091
Just speak up, because any idea
that comes into your mind...

285
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,321
will be an associated idea.

286
00:17:29,665 --> 00:17:32,156
They finally caught on to Mrs. Allison...

287
00:17:32,234 --> 00:17:34,498
when she poisoned
her 80-year-old father...

288
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,629
with arsenic in his buttermilk.

289
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:40,002
- There, say anything quickly.
- But what?

290
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:43,044
I'll be a middle-aged Mongoloid
from Memphis.

291
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,909
Sweetsie, little lovebird.

292
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,815
Now you play your little cards right,
and instead of a piece of cuttlebone...

293
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:52,513
Uncle Emory will get you
a piece of Dr. Kettlebaum.

294
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:53,612
Emory.

295
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:56,682
Go on, Christine, no matter how silly.

296
00:17:57,893 --> 00:18:00,589
What I was thinking
at that very moment...

297
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,563
was that outside of Kenneth,
my father is the dearest man...

298
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:05,327
in the whole world.

299
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,301
- Is that silly?
- No, certainly not.

300
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,168
- Isn't your father Richard Bravo?
- Yes.

301
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:13,742
There's a man that can write for you.

302
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:16,300
Those pieces from the Pacific
during the war.

303
00:18:16,378 --> 00:18:18,243
I'm very proud of him.

304
00:18:18,313 --> 00:18:22,215
The whole country is,
but we've disclosed nothing yet.

305
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:24,047
Go on with your story, Reggie.

306
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:26,280
I think we can afford a change of subject.

307
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,483
All right, then, there.
What does that suggest to you?

308
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,856
It doesn't suggest anything
because I'm still thinking about my father.

309
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,453
What about him?

310
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:37,698
No editing, no skipping.

311
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:42,495
What I was thinking that time
was even sillier.

312
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:47,802
I've always had the feeling
that I was an adopted child...

313
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,504
and that the Bravos
weren't my real parents.

314
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:52,877
You poor, innocent darling.

315
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:55,777
Don't you know
that the changeling fantasy...

316
00:18:55,851 --> 00:18:57,842
is the commonest of childhood?

317
00:18:58,654 --> 00:19:01,452
Why, I once believed
that I was a foundling...

318
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:04,020
with royal blood.

319
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,187
Plantagenet, I think it was.

320
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:10,197
And Emory, let's see. Emory was...

321
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:11,823
I was a chipmunk.

322
00:19:13,468 --> 00:19:16,596
You really always
have had this suspicion...

323
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:18,640
- that you were adopted?
- Yes, always.

324
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,072
- But no evidence.
- Only that I dream about it.

325
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:22,440
What kind of dream?

326
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:26,072
Monica, really.
Do I have to tell my dreams, too?

327
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:29,447
It's all so silly,
I haven't even mentioned it to Kenneth.

328
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:32,052
The gal that really took the prize...

329
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,816
was that one you wrote about
in that first book of yours.

330
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,121
The one that pulled all those jobs,
and they couldn't convict her.

331
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:40,821
You mean Bessie. Bessie Denker.

332
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,193
Most amazing woman
in all the annals of homicide.

333
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,065
She was beautiful, she had brains...

334
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:52,232
she was ruthless, and she never used
the same poison twice, either.

335
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:55,806
Her father, for example, died of rabies...

336
00:19:56,078 --> 00:19:58,706
supposedly contracted from a mad dog.

337
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:02,379
It just happened
that all his money went to Bessie.

338
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,181
Did you say Bessie Denker?

339
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:06,847
Yes.

340
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:09,847
There. Now we might
have struck something.

341
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:13,622
Murderess, poisons,
et cetera, ad infinitum.

342
00:20:13,862 --> 00:20:16,057
Monica, this really is nonsense.

343
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:19,032
Here, let's clear
some of these things away.

344
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,998
You still planning on hanging around
for a few days' fishing?

345
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:32,012
I'd sure like to,
but I don't want to bother you any.

346
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,981
Listen, any excuse with me for fishing.

347
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,847
We'll get the weather for tomorrow...

348
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:39,251
and if the channel
reflects a good deep blue...

349
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,915
...nothing more important
has happened for many years...

350
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:43,821
in the field of foreign affairs.

351
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:45,883
That's the international news
for the moment.

352
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:48,156
Now let's look
at the local weather forecast.

353
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,221
For tomorrow and...

354
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,000
I interrupt this program to...

355
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:56,734
I have been asked to announce...

356
00:20:56,805 --> 00:20:58,932
that one of the children
on the annual picnic...

357
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,271
of the Fern Country day school...

358
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,642
was accidentally drowned
in the bay early this noon.

359
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,446
The name of the victim is being withheld
until the parents are first notified.

360
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,510
More news of this tragic affair
is expected momentarily.

361
00:21:12,587 --> 00:21:14,782
- Monica!
- It was not Rhoda.

362
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,347
Rhoda is too self-reliant a child.

363
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:20,987
It was some timid, confused youngster
afraid of its own shadow.

364
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:24,098
- It was certainly not Rhoda.
- Emory, please!

365
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:27,865
To continue with the weather.

366
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,131
What am I standing...

367
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:34,304
We now have the full story
on the Fern School drowning.

368
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,671
We are now authorized to give you
the name of the victim.

369
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,446
It was 8-year-old Claude Daigle...

370
00:21:40,515 --> 00:21:44,110
the only child of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Daigle
of 126 Willow Street.

371
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:47,749
He appears to have fallen
into the water from the abandoned pier...

372
00:21:47,823 --> 00:21:49,188
on the Fern property.

373
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:51,384
It is a mystery how the boy
got on the pier...

374
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,725
for all the children
had been forbidden to play near or on it.

375
00:21:54,796 --> 00:21:57,196
But his body was found
off the end of the landing...

376
00:21:57,265 --> 00:21:58,892
wedged among the pilings.

377
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:00,491
The guard who brought up the body...

378
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,094
applied artificial respiration,
but without result.

379
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:06,032
There were bruises
on the forehead and hands...

380
00:22:06,108 --> 00:22:10,738
but it is assumed that these were caused
by the body washing against the pilings.

381
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:14,273
And now to continue
with the report of local weather.

382
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:16,416
Scattered showers...

383
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:20,610
That poor little boy. That poor child.

384
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,220
They'll send the children
home immediately.

385
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,452
They must be on their way now.

386
00:22:25,694 --> 00:22:27,719
I don't know what to say to her.

387
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:31,458
Rhoda is eight. I remember
I didn't know anything about death...

388
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:34,934
or it didn't touch me closely
until I was much older.

389
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,504
A teacher I adored died.

390
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:42,276
My whole world changed and darkened.

391
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,647
Monica, here comes the bus now.

392
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:50,742
I don't know what to say to her.

393
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:54,152
This is between you and Rhoda now.
Nobody else can help.

394
00:22:54,689 --> 00:22:56,054
I suppose.

395
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,286
I would come with you...

396
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,091
but I think mother and child
are better alone at a time like this.

397
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,623
Darling!

398
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:09,465
Mother, we didn't really have our lunch...

399
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:11,597
because Claude Daigle was drowned.

400
00:23:11,673 --> 00:23:13,868
I know. It was on the radio.

401
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:18,106
He was drowned, so then they were all
rushing, calling, and hurrying...

402
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:21,613
to see if they could make him alive again,
but they couldn't.

403
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:24,811
They said the picnic was over,
and we had to go home.

404
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,420
I'm glad you're home.

405
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,117
So could I have
a peanut butter sandwich and milk?

406
00:23:30,192 --> 00:23:32,990
Rhoda, did you see him?

407
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:35,928
Yes, of course.
Then they put a blanket over him...

408
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,727
No. Did you see him taken from the water?

409
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,362
Yes, they laid him out on the lawn
and worked, but it didn't help.

410
00:23:43,438 --> 00:23:44,905
Sweetheart...

411
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,276
I want you to try to get these pictures
right out of your mind.

412
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:53,440
I don't want you to be worried
or frightened one little bit.

413
00:23:53,782 --> 00:23:56,012
These things happen to us sometimes...

414
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:59,019
and when they do, we simply accept them.

415
00:23:59,087 --> 00:24:01,385
But I thought it was exciting.

416
00:24:01,656 --> 00:24:04,284
Can I have the peanut butter sandwich?

417
00:24:06,328 --> 00:24:07,989
Why, yes, darling.

418
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,722
I'll get it ready for you.

419
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:45,462
LeRoy.

420
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,808
Just doing my baskets, Mrs. Penmark.

421
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,402
Good.

422
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:03,415
- I thought I'd go out and skate after.
- Very well, dear.

423
00:25:03,485 --> 00:25:06,716
Mighty awful event at the Fern School
this morning, Mrs. Penmark?

424
00:25:06,788 --> 00:25:08,756
Yes, LeRoy. It was very sad.

425
00:25:08,823 --> 00:25:11,519
They say when they found that little boy...

426
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,220
Yes, Mrs. Penmark.

427
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,293
Now, Rhoda...

428
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:20,692
you're behaving very well, dear...

429
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,865
but still, it's a terrible thing
to see and remember.

430
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,172
I understand how you feel, darling.

431
00:25:30,912 --> 00:25:33,574
I don't know what you're talking about.

432
00:25:33,815 --> 00:25:35,908
I don't feel any way at all.

433
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:51,696
Have you been naughty?

434
00:25:51,766 --> 00:25:53,358
Why, no, Mother.

435
00:25:55,437 --> 00:25:58,167
What will you give me
for a basket of kisses?

436
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:03,439
I'll give you a basket of hugs.

437
00:26:05,847 --> 00:26:08,509
I want to finish my sandwich
while I skate, Mother.

438
00:26:10,418 --> 00:26:12,409
Well, then you should.

439
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,447
How come you go skating
and enjoying yourself...

440
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:44,349
when your poor little schoolmate's
still damp from drowning in the bay?

441
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:47,513
It looks to me like you'd be staying home,
crying your eyes out.

442
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:50,717
Either that or be in church,
burning a candle in a blue cup.

443
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:53,352
You ask me, and I say
you don't even feel sorry...

444
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:56,124
about what happened
to that poor little boy.

445
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,994
Why should I feel sorry?

446
00:26:58,066 --> 00:27:00,694
It was Claude Daigle
who got drowned, not me.

447
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,033
Ain't scared of nothing?

448
00:27:09,577 --> 00:27:11,841
I'll find a way to scare you.

449
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,577
"The knight had not gone
more than a dozen paces...

450
00:27:19,654 --> 00:27:21,849
"before he saw beside the path...

451
00:27:21,956 --> 00:27:26,188
"a beautiful lady who laid out
a fair damask cloth under an oak...

452
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,252
"and set thereon...

453
00:27:29,097 --> 00:27:31,793
"cakes and dainties...

454
00:27:34,302 --> 00:27:36,668
"and a flagon...

455
00:27:38,306 --> 00:27:40,137
"with two silver cups..."

456
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,704
- Mommy.
- What?

457
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:46,679
Why aren't you reading?

458
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,416
I was just thinking, I guess.

459
00:27:51,553 --> 00:27:53,578
About what, the accident?

460
00:27:56,791 --> 00:28:00,090
Partly. And my telephone call.
The circuits were busy.

461
00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:02,423
What are cakes and dainties?

462
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,267
They're like little cakes, you know.

463
00:28:07,335 --> 00:28:09,997
"Cakes and dainties,
and a flagon with two silver cups.

464
00:28:10,071 --> 00:28:12,266
"'Knight,' she called. 'Knight, come eat...

465
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,741
"'and drink with me, for you are hungry
and thirsty, and I am alone."'

466
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,368
Did you take your vitamins, dear?

467
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,778
Yes. I took one before. This is my second.

468
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:24,813
I was saving them because I like the juice.

469
00:28:29,858 --> 00:28:33,191
- I'll close my eyes, but I won't be asleep.
- I know.

470
00:28:34,562 --> 00:28:36,189
"And then the knight answered her.

471
00:28:36,264 --> 00:28:39,597
"'I thank you, fair lady,
for I am not only hungry and thirsty...

472
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:41,464
"'but I'm lost within the forest.'

473
00:28:41,536 --> 00:28:43,629
"Then he let his palfrey graze nearby...

474
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:47,106
"and he feasted with the lady,
who gave him loving looks...

475
00:28:47,175 --> 00:28:51,134
"sweeter than the wine from the flagon,
though the wine was sweet and strong.

476
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,611
"And in this fashion, the time passed...

477
00:28:53,681 --> 00:28:57,447
"till the light was gone
out of the wood and it was dark.

478
00:28:58,353 --> 00:29:02,756
"And he was aware that the pavilion
had not been there in the daylight...

479
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:05,753
"but had been created...

480
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:09,158
"out of darkness...

481
00:29:10,732 --> 00:29:12,359
"by magic."

482
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:15,230
Rhoda.

483
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:13,761
- May I come in, Mrs. Penmark?
- Yes, of course, Miss Fern.

484
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:16,922
I was going to come and see you.
I got your note.

485
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:20,966
We're in such distress,
all of us at the school.

486
00:30:21,336 --> 00:30:24,567
We've suffered such a blow,
losing one of the children that way...

487
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:26,504
- I know...
- I'm sure you'll forgive us...

488
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,905
for going over and over things.

489
00:30:27,976 --> 00:30:32,140
I think everyone has been worried,
puzzled, and saddened.

490
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:36,041
I don't think I've ever known
any happening to puzzle...

491
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:38,210
so many people in so many ways...

492
00:30:38,453 --> 00:30:40,478
and I can help so few of them.

493
00:30:41,155 --> 00:30:43,749
I've just come from seeing Mrs. Daigle.

494
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:46,350
Of course, our first thought was of her.

495
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,590
The rest of us are touched
only lightly by this tragedy.

496
00:30:49,664 --> 00:30:53,122
- She'll have to live with it all of her life.
- I know.

497
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:55,359
I've seen her several times...

498
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,537
and each time she's asked me
to find out from you...

499
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,267
if you had any possible clue
to where the penmanship medal might be.

500
00:31:02,343 --> 00:31:03,776
It was lost?

501
00:31:03,845 --> 00:31:07,042
Yes, it wasn't found with the body,
and has completely disappeared.

502
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,049
I didn't know about this.

503
00:31:16,858 --> 00:31:19,827
- Good morning, Miss Fern.
- Good morning, Rhoda.

504
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:23,391
Mother, could I sit under
the scuppernong arbor for a while...

505
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,795
and read my book?

506
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:26,993
- Of course, Rhoda.
- It's so shady there...

507
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:30,037
and I can see your window,
you can watch me from there...

508
00:31:30,104 --> 00:31:32,072
and I'd like to be where you can see me.

509
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,869
Is it a new book?

510
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:38,144
It's Elsie Dinsmore, the one I got
for a prize at Sunday school.

511
00:31:38,212 --> 00:31:41,375
- I'll be here.
- I'll be right there all the time.

512
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,848
Goodbye, Miss Fern.

513
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:55,289
It occurred to me that Rhoda
might have told you a detail or two...

514
00:31:55,363 --> 00:31:58,298
that she hadn't remembered
when she talked with me.

515
00:31:58,366 --> 00:32:02,063
You see, she was the last to see
the little Daigle boy alive.

516
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,731
- Are you sure of this?
- Yes.

517
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:11,242
- I hadn't realized...
- Several times during the morning...

518
00:32:11,312 --> 00:32:13,974
Rhoda had to be stopped
from following Claude around...

519
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:16,312
and trying to take the medal
away from him.

520
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,215
She kept snatching at it...

521
00:32:18,286 --> 00:32:21,551
and he finally became very upset
and started to cry.

522
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,290
I'm terribly sorry to hear this.

523
00:32:25,727 --> 00:32:28,218
When you say that Rhoda
might have been the last one...

524
00:32:28,296 --> 00:32:30,856
- to see the little Daigle boy alive...
- Yes.

525
00:32:30,932 --> 00:32:33,526
Shortly before Claude's body
was discovered...

526
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:36,434
the beach guard saw Rhoda
coming off the wharf.

527
00:32:36,504 --> 00:32:39,598
He shouted a warning,
but by then she was on the beach...

528
00:32:39,674 --> 00:32:42,507
and walking back to join the main activity.

529
00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:45,511
So he decided to forget the matter.

530
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,681
The guard didn't
identify the girl by name...

531
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,945
but she had blond pigtails
and was wearing a red dress, he said.

532
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:56,990
And Rhoda was the only girl
who wore a dress that day.

533
00:32:59,193 --> 00:33:01,491
At 1:00, the lunch bell rang...

534
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,490
and Claude was missing
when the roll was called.

535
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,331
- You know the rest of it.
- Yes, but this is very serious.

536
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,168
- lf Rhoda was on that wharf...
- Not serious, really.

537
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,765
Children conceal things from adults.

538
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:20,447
Suppose Rhoda did follow the Daigle child
onto the wharf.

539
00:33:20,515 --> 00:33:23,951
So many things could have happened,
quite innocently.

540
00:33:24,385 --> 00:33:27,821
He may have concealed himself
in the old boathouse...

541
00:33:28,222 --> 00:33:31,350
and then when discovered,
may have backed away from Rhoda...

542
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,950
and fallen in the water.

543
00:33:33,027 --> 00:33:35,222
That could have happened, but I don't...

544
00:33:35,296 --> 00:33:38,026
Later on, when it was too late
to do anything...

545
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,829
she was afraid to admit
what had happened.

546
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:44,366
Then, you do think that Rhoda knows
something she isn't admitting.

547
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,805
Yes, I think
that like many a frightened soldier...

548
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:48,273
she deserted under fire.

549
00:33:48,342 --> 00:33:50,503
This is not a serious charge.

550
00:33:51,312 --> 00:33:53,576
Few of us are courageous when tested.

551
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:55,548
Yes, but she has lied, though.

552
00:33:56,084 --> 00:33:58,575
Is there any adult who hasn't lied?

553
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:01,250
Smooth the lines
from your brow, my dear.

554
00:34:01,322 --> 00:34:02,949
You're so much prettier when smiling.

555
00:34:03,024 --> 00:34:04,514
Well, I'll question Rhoda.

556
00:34:04,592 --> 00:34:07,686
I wish you would, though I doubt
you'll learn more than you know.

557
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:11,095
Miss Fern, there's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

558
00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:14,194
There was a floral tribute
at the Daigle boy's funeral...

559
00:34:14,268 --> 00:34:16,065
sent by the children of the Fern School.

560
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,537
The children must have helped
share the expenses...

561
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:20,335
but I haven't been asked to pay my part.

562
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:21,670
I know, my dear.

563
00:34:21,743 --> 00:34:24,712
We thought you'd like to send
flowers individually.

564
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:29,582
Why should I want to send
flowers individually?

565
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,379
Rhoda wasn't friendly with the boy...

566
00:34:31,452 --> 00:34:34,114
and my husband and I
haven't even met the Daigles.

567
00:34:34,188 --> 00:34:36,418
I don't know, my dear. I really...

568
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,285
There are three of us.
In the hurry of making decisions...

569
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,329
You make excuses for Rhoda,
at the same time, you admit to me...

570
00:34:42,396 --> 00:34:45,365
that you didn't ask me
to pay my share of the flowers.

571
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:49,529
And the reasons you give me
for not asking are obviously specious.

572
00:34:50,805 --> 00:34:53,968
Does this mean that in the minds
of you and your sisters...

573
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:56,441
there's some connection...

574
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,378
between the boy's death
and Rhoda's presence on the wharf?

575
00:34:59,447 --> 00:35:00,880
I refuse to believe that.

576
00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:04,384
- But you've acted as if there were.
- Yes, perhaps we have.

577
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:06,286
Perhaps you...

578
00:35:07,722 --> 00:35:12,056
Miss Fern, this has been
a terrible tragedy for Mrs. Daigle.

579
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:14,856
As you say, she's lost her only child...

580
00:35:15,396 --> 00:35:18,627
but if there's any shadow over Rhoda
because of what has happened...

581
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,929
then I have to live under it...

582
00:35:21,002 --> 00:35:22,833
and my husband does, too.

583
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:27,739
As for Rhoda, she would not be happy
in your school next year.

584
00:35:28,242 --> 00:35:29,834
No, she would not.

585
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:32,439
And since she would not...

586
00:35:32,513 --> 00:35:34,572
it would be as well
to make up our minds now...

587
00:35:34,649 --> 00:35:35,911
that she will not be there.

588
00:35:35,983 --> 00:35:37,610
Then there is some shadow over her.

589
00:35:37,685 --> 00:35:40,552
You've already decided
not to invite her back.

590
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:43,317
- Yes, we've made that decision.
- You can't tell me why?

591
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:47,293
I think her behavior in the matter
of the medal is sufficient explanation.

592
00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:50,919
She has no sense of fair play.
She's a poor loser. She doesn't like to...

593
00:35:50,998 --> 00:35:54,331
Surely you're not saying
that Rhoda had anything...

594
00:35:55,336 --> 00:35:57,827
to do with the Daigle boy's death?

595
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,037
Of course not.

596
00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:04,534
Such a possibility
never entered our minds.

597
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,311
I'll have to answer that.

598
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,277
Of course, my dear.

599
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:20,360
Thanks, we're Mrs. Daigle and Mr. Daigle.
You didn't have to let us in.

600
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,859
You realize we followed you.

601
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,961
We shouldn't have done it.
I'm a little drunk.

602
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,234
I guess you never get a little drunk.

603
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:39,345
You're very welcome, both of you.

604
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:42,178
Don't pay no attention to him.

605
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,481
He's all for good breeding.
He was trying to stop me.

606
00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:49,550
How are you, Mrs. Penmark?
You've always had plenty.

607
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:52,025
You're a superior person...

608
00:36:52,226 --> 00:36:54,524
- No, I'm not.
- Yes.

609
00:36:54,729 --> 00:36:58,096
Father's rich. Rich Richard Bravo.

610
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:00,495
I know. Famous.

611
00:37:01,602 --> 00:37:03,968
Me, I worked in a beauty parlor.

612
00:37:05,006 --> 00:37:07,338
Miss Fern used to come there.
She looks down on me.

613
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:09,740
- Please, Mrs. Daigle...
- I was that frumpy blond.

614
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,711
Now I've lost my boy, and I'm a lush.
Everybody knows it.

615
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,805
We're worried about Mrs. Daigle.

616
00:37:14,882 --> 00:37:18,010
She's under a doctor's care.
She's not herself.

617
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,219
But I know what I'm about just the same.

618
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,382
Just the same.

619
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:27,450
May I call you Christine?

620
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:30,656
I'm quite aware you come
from a higher level of society.

621
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,425
You probably made a debut, all that.

622
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:36,496
I always considered Christine
a gentle name.

623
00:37:36,804 --> 00:37:38,567
Hortense sounds fat.

624
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,367
That's me. Hortense.

625
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:44,209
"My girl Hortense,"
they used to sing of me...

626
00:37:44,278 --> 00:37:47,941
"hasn't got much sense.
Let's write her name on the privy fence."

627
00:37:51,218 --> 00:37:53,448
Children can be nasty, don't you think?

628
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,113
Please, Hortense.

629
00:37:57,558 --> 00:37:59,719
You're so attractive, Christine.

630
00:37:59,827 --> 00:38:02,227
You got exquisite taste in clothes.

631
00:38:02,296 --> 00:38:05,094
Of course, you got ample money
to buy them with.

632
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:07,157
What I came to see you about...

633
00:38:07,234 --> 00:38:09,964
I asked Miss Fern
what happened to Claude's medal...

634
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,504
and she wouldn't tell me a thing...

635
00:38:11,572 --> 00:38:14,097
- I don't know...
- You know more than you're telling.

636
00:38:14,175 --> 00:38:16,006
You're a sly one 'cause of the school.

637
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:18,841
You don't want the school
to get a bad name.

638
00:38:18,913 --> 00:38:23,282
You know more than you're telling,
Miss "Butter Wouldn't Melt" Fern.

639
00:38:24,518 --> 00:38:27,112
There's something funny
about the whole thing.

640
00:38:27,188 --> 00:38:29,918
I said so over and over to Mr. Daigle.

641
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,554
He married quite late, you know,
in his 40s.

642
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:35,818
Of course...

643
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:39,457
I wasn't exactly what the fella calls
a spring chicken, either.

644
00:38:41,135 --> 00:38:43,433
We won't have any more children.

645
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:46,336
No more.

646
00:38:49,844 --> 00:38:53,541
Please, Hortense,
let me take you home where you can rest.

647
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,144
Rest? Sleep?

648
00:38:56,917 --> 00:39:00,648
When you can't sleep at night,
you can't sleep in the daylight.

649
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:04,391
I just lie, and I look at the water
where he went down.

650
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:08,959
Christine, there is something funny
about this whole thing.

651
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:12,363
I heard your little girl was the last one
to see him alive.

652
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,901
Would you ask her
about those last few minutes...

653
00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:18,268
and tell me what she says?
Maybe she remembers some little thing.

654
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:20,500
I don't care how small it is.

655
00:39:20,808 --> 00:39:22,571
No matter how small.

656
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,074
You know something?

657
00:39:29,183 --> 00:39:31,413
Miss Fern dyes her hair.

658
00:39:38,325 --> 00:39:40,919
She knows something,
and she won't tell me.

659
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:45,896
My poor little Claude,
what did I do to you?

660
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:49,158
Christine, somebody took that medal
off his shirt.

661
00:39:49,236 --> 00:39:52,137
It couldn't have come off by accident
'cause I pinned it on...

662
00:39:52,206 --> 00:39:55,801
and it had a little lock with a clasp
in the back. It was no accident.

663
00:39:59,947 --> 00:40:02,507
You can wear such simple things,
can't you?

664
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,676
I never could wear simple things.

665
00:40:04,752 --> 00:40:06,344
I couldn't even buy them.

666
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,253
When I got them home,
they didn't look simple.

667
00:40:10,524 --> 00:40:13,254
He was such a lovely, dear little boy.

668
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:18,127
He used to say I was his sweetheart...

669
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:21,828
and he was gonna marry me
when he grew up. I used to laugh so.

670
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:24,268
"You'll forget about me long before then.

671
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,704
"You'll find a prettier girl,
and you'll marry her."

672
00:40:26,774 --> 00:40:28,765
You know what he said then?

673
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,310
"No, I won't...

674
00:40:30,377 --> 00:40:34,211
"'cause there's not a prettier girl
in the whole world than you are."

675
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:39,417
If you don't believe me, you ask the lady
who comes in and cleans.

676
00:40:39,487 --> 00:40:41,284
She was present at the time.

677
00:40:44,892 --> 00:40:47,190
Why do you put your arms around me?

678
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:49,422
You don't give a hoot about me.

679
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:53,063
You're a superior person and all that.
I'm just...

680
00:40:53,934 --> 00:40:55,333
God forgive me.

681
00:40:55,402 --> 00:40:57,700
There were bruises on his hands...

682
00:40:57,771 --> 00:41:00,365
and that peculiar crescent-shaped mark
on his forehead...

683
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:02,568
that the undertaker covered up.

684
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,407
He must have bled before he died.
That's what the doctor said.

685
00:41:06,514 --> 00:41:08,209
And where's the medal?

686
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,647
Who took the medal?

687
00:41:13,687 --> 00:41:17,282
I have a right to know
what happened to the penmanship medal!

688
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:20,225
If I knew, I'd have a pretty good idea
what happened to him.

689
00:41:20,294 --> 00:41:22,319
I know why you put your arms around me.

690
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,194
I'm as good as you are.
Claude was better than your girl.

691
00:41:25,266 --> 00:41:27,166
He won the medal. She didn't.

692
00:41:36,477 --> 00:41:37,808
I'm drunk.

693
00:41:40,181 --> 00:41:43,981
It's a pleasure to stay drunk
when your little boy's been killed.

694
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:47,351
Maybe I better lay down.

695
00:41:50,024 --> 00:41:53,016
We'll go home. You can lie down there.

696
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,658
Why not?

697
00:41:57,898 --> 00:42:00,162
Why not go home and lay down?

698
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:04,029
- Goodbye, all.
- Sorry.

699
00:42:04,471 --> 00:42:07,167
Who cares what they think?

700
00:42:08,475 --> 00:42:12,935
I drank half a bottle of bonded corn
in little sips, so I'm drunk as I can be.

701
00:42:31,565 --> 00:42:32,964
Poor woman.

702
00:42:37,938 --> 00:42:39,530
I'll be getting back.

703
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:44,308
Thank you for bearing with her
and with me.

704
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,111
I'll talk to Rhoda.

705
00:42:49,617 --> 00:42:53,747
I know there isn't anything
that will help that poor creature...

706
00:42:53,854 --> 00:42:55,788
but I'll do what I can.

707
00:42:55,889 --> 00:42:58,289
We both have to do what we can.

708
00:42:59,593 --> 00:43:03,427
- Goodbye, Mrs. Penmark.
- Goodbye, Miss Fern.

709
00:43:12,473 --> 00:43:15,408
She'll have to live with this until she dies.

710
00:43:16,243 --> 00:43:18,268
Yes, until she dies.

711
00:43:19,647 --> 00:43:21,012
Thank you.

712
00:43:44,171 --> 00:43:46,435
- Rhoda.
- Yes, Mother?

713
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,870
Will you come in a moment, please?

714
00:43:48,942 --> 00:43:51,172
May I just finish this last page?

715
00:43:51,245 --> 00:43:53,975
Very well, but then I want to talk to you.

716
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,606
Yes, Mother.

717
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:05,619
Hello?

718
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,784
Yes, speaking.

719
00:44:09,463 --> 00:44:10,657
Kenneth?

720
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:14,634
Darling, I am so glad you called.

721
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,732
Honey, what was the accident
at Rhoda's school?

722
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,007
The one where the little boy
was drowned?

723
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:23,476
The little boy who was drowned?

724
00:44:24,478 --> 00:44:26,207
Has it affected Rhoda any?

725
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:29,814
No, Rhoda's her usual self.

726
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:33,683
She's right outside where I can see her.
I just talked to her.

727
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:36,985
I miss you both
and love you both so much.

728
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,992
Do you really, darling?

729
00:44:40,561 --> 00:44:42,495
I hope it won't be too much longer.

730
00:44:42,963 --> 00:44:44,931
It'll be at least four weeks.

731
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:50,267
Four weeks is a long time.

732
00:44:51,238 --> 00:44:53,035
Write to me as...

733
00:44:53,707 --> 00:44:54,867
Kenneth.

734
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,269
Yes, darling?

735
00:44:57,711 --> 00:44:59,269
I love you.

736
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,813
Col. Penmark, the General is waiting, sir.

737
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,440
I'll be right there.

738
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,844
Honey, the General just buzzed for me.

739
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,317
All right, dear,
then don't keep him waiting.

740
00:45:10,424 --> 00:45:12,551
Goodbye, darling. Give my love to Rhoda.

741
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,886
Bye.

742
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:22,966
Monica!

743
00:45:23,036 --> 00:45:27,632
Don't be alarmed. I'm just in and out.
This is not another psychiatric session.

744
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:29,073
Come on in, please.

745
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,338
It's Rhoda's locket I'm using for an excuse.

746
00:45:31,412 --> 00:45:35,815
I've actually found a place where
they'll change the stone and clean it.

747
00:45:35,883 --> 00:45:38,010
I'll get the locket.
I know where she keeps it.

748
00:45:38,085 --> 00:45:40,019
- I think it's in her treasure box.
- Good.

749
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:42,681
They didn't agree to this
without a little pressure.

750
00:45:42,756 --> 00:45:45,281
- In fact, I had to threaten them.
- Not really!

751
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,917
You don't know the old busybody.

752
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:50,555
She uses pressure, influence,
bribery, blackmail.

753
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:53,031
And I had to pull them all
on old Mr. Finchley.

754
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,830
He said this little job would take
at least two weeks.

755
00:45:55,903 --> 00:45:57,803
But I told him straight...

756
00:45:58,038 --> 00:46:01,166
I'm handling
the community chest again this year.

757
00:46:01,241 --> 00:46:03,436
You found it. The darling.

758
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:07,571
She keeps her treasures so carefully.
It's a kind of miserly delight.

759
00:46:07,648 --> 00:46:09,445
- Shall I wrap it?
- No, darling.

760
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,108
I'll just drop it in my purse.

761
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,780
My horoscope says today is the day
for paying attention to small objects...

762
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:18,313
and getting things done.
Now I take to the air, dear Christine.

763
00:46:18,392 --> 00:46:21,088
Only do forgive me for bursting in
and rushing out.

764
00:46:21,161 --> 00:46:22,719
No ceremony, please.

765
00:46:22,796 --> 00:46:24,957
No, darling. Be seeing you.

766
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:20,479
What did you want
to see me about, Mother?

767
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,628
So you had the medal after all.

768
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:33,256
- Claude Daigle's medal.
- Where did you find it?

769
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:34,664
How did the penmanship medal...

770
00:47:34,735 --> 00:47:38,796
happen to be hidden under the lining
in the drawer of your treasure chest?

771
00:47:39,172 --> 00:47:40,764
Now I want the truth.

772
00:47:43,076 --> 00:47:46,239
Mother, when we move
into our new house...

773
00:47:46,547 --> 00:47:48,708
can we have a scuppernong arbor?

774
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:51,683
Can we? It's so shady and pretty.

775
00:47:51,852 --> 00:47:54,650
- And I love sitting under...
- Answer my question!

776
00:47:54,721 --> 00:47:57,815
And remember, I know
more about the picnic than you may think.

777
00:47:57,891 --> 00:47:59,449
Miss Fern has told me a great deal.

778
00:47:59,526 --> 00:48:01,960
Don't make up any stories for my benefit.

779
00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:04,998
What was Claude Daigle's medal
doing in your drawer?

780
00:48:05,165 --> 00:48:07,690
It certainly didn't get there by itself.

781
00:48:08,435 --> 00:48:10,665
I'm waiting for your answer.

782
00:48:10,737 --> 00:48:13,501
I don't know how
the medal got there, Mother.

783
00:48:13,574 --> 00:48:14,598
How could I?

784
00:48:14,675 --> 00:48:17,405
You know very well
how the medal got there.

785
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:20,173
Did you go on the wharf at any time
during the picnic?

786
00:48:20,247 --> 00:48:21,714
Yes, Mother. I went there once.

787
00:48:21,782 --> 00:48:23,977
Was it before or after
you were bothering Claude?

788
00:48:24,051 --> 00:48:26,042
I wasn't bothering Claude, Mother!

789
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:29,748
- What makes you think that?
- Why did you go on the wharf?

790
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:32,815
It was real early, when we first got there.

791
00:48:32,893 --> 00:48:36,226
Why did you go on the wharf?
You knew it was forbidden.

792
00:48:36,296 --> 00:48:40,392
One of the big boys said there were
little oysters that grew in the pilings.

793
00:48:40,467 --> 00:48:42,230
I just wanted to see if they did.

794
00:48:42,302 --> 00:48:44,736
A guard said he saw you
coming off the wharf...

795
00:48:44,805 --> 00:48:46,534
just a little before lunchtime.

796
00:48:46,607 --> 00:48:48,370
I don't know why he says that.

797
00:48:48,442 --> 00:48:51,570
He's wrong, and I told Miss Fern
he was wrong.

798
00:48:52,312 --> 00:48:54,906
He hollered at me
to come off the wharf, and I did.

799
00:48:54,982 --> 00:48:57,815
I went back to the lawn,
and that's where I saw Claude...

800
00:48:57,884 --> 00:48:59,511
but I wasn't bothering him.

801
00:48:59,586 --> 00:49:01,451
What did you say to Claude?

802
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:05,283
I said if I didn't win the medal...

803
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:07,219
I was glad he did.

804
00:49:07,294 --> 00:49:09,626
Rhoda, please!
I know you're an adroit liar...

805
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,721
but I must have the truth.

806
00:49:11,798 --> 00:49:13,663
But it's all true, every word!

807
00:49:13,734 --> 00:49:16,703
I was told that you were seen trying...

808
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:19,898
to snatch the medal off Claude's shirt.

809
00:49:19,973 --> 00:49:21,736
Is that all true, every word?

810
00:49:21,808 --> 00:49:23,639
Oh, that was one of the monitors...

811
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,042
that big girl, Mary Beth Musgrove.

812
00:49:26,279 --> 00:49:28,713
She told everybody she saw me.

813
00:49:28,782 --> 00:49:30,943
Even LeRoy knows she saw me.

814
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:34,652
You see, Claude and I
were just playing a game we made up.

815
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,189
He said if I could catch him in 10 minutes...

816
00:49:37,257 --> 00:49:41,125
and touch the medal with my hand,
it would be like Prisoner's Base.

817
00:49:41,762 --> 00:49:44,128
He'd let me wear the medal for an hour.

818
00:49:44,197 --> 00:49:46,825
How can Mary Beth say I took the medal?

819
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,460
- I didn't.
- She didn't say you took the medal.

820
00:49:49,536 --> 00:49:53,597
She said you tried to grab at it,
and that Claude ran away down the beach.

821
00:49:53,674 --> 00:49:57,405
- Did you have the medal even then?
- No, Mother, not then.

822
00:49:58,445 --> 00:50:02,142
- Rhoda, how did you get the medal?
- I got it later on.

823
00:50:02,215 --> 00:50:03,409
How?

824
00:50:03,483 --> 00:50:05,542
Claude went back on his promise.

825
00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:07,382
Then I followed him up the beach.

826
00:50:07,454 --> 00:50:10,787
Then he stopped and said
I could wear the medal all day...

827
00:50:10,857 --> 00:50:12,825
if I gave him 50 cents.

828
00:50:15,195 --> 00:50:16,594
Stop that!

829
00:50:17,698 --> 00:50:20,599
- Is that the truth?
- Why, yes, Mother.

830
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:24,130
I gave him 50 cents,
and he let me wear the medal.

831
00:50:24,204 --> 00:50:28,004
Then why didn't you tell this to Miss Fern
when she questioned you?

832
00:50:28,809 --> 00:50:31,607
Mommy, Miss Fern doesn't like me at all.

833
00:50:31,712 --> 00:50:36,206
I was afraid she'd think bad things of me
if I told her I had the medal.

834
00:50:36,817 --> 00:50:39,945
Rhoda. Now, listen to me.

835
00:50:41,021 --> 00:50:44,149
You knew how much Mrs. Daigle
wanted that medal, now, didn't you?

836
00:50:44,224 --> 00:50:46,215
Yes, Mother, I guess I did.

837
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:49,387
Then why didn't you give it to her?

838
00:50:50,197 --> 00:50:52,529
She's lost her little boy, Rhoda.

839
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:55,329
She's heartbroken about this.
She may never get over it.

840
00:50:55,402 --> 00:50:57,427
It may have destroyed her.

841
00:50:59,005 --> 00:51:00,404
Do you know what I mean?

842
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,442
Yes, Mother, I guess so.

843
00:51:04,111 --> 00:51:05,772
No, you don't know what I mean.

844
00:51:05,846 --> 00:51:09,839
But it was silly to want to bury the medal
pinned on Claude's coat.

845
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,842
Claude was dead.

846
00:51:11,952 --> 00:51:15,888
He wouldn't know whether
he had the medal pinned on him or not.

847
00:51:16,957 --> 00:51:19,448
I've got the prettiest mother.

848
00:51:19,793 --> 00:51:22,125
I've got the nicest mother.

849
00:51:22,195 --> 00:51:24,095
That's what I tell everybody.

850
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:27,565
I say I've got the sweetest mother
in the world.

851
00:51:27,634 --> 00:51:29,659
If she wants a little boy that bad...

852
00:51:29,736 --> 00:51:32,296
why doesn't she take one
out of the orphans' home?

853
00:51:32,372 --> 00:51:34,966
Rhoda! Get away from me.
Don't talk to me.

854
00:51:35,041 --> 00:51:38,442
- We have nothing to say to each other.
- Okay, Mother.

855
00:51:42,449 --> 00:51:46,783
Rhoda, when we lived in Wichita,
there was an old lady...

856
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:50,016
who lived upstairs, Mrs. Clara Post.
She liked you very much.

857
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:52,752
Every afternoon you used to go upstairs
to visit her.

858
00:51:52,826 --> 00:51:54,760
She used to show you all her treasures.

859
00:51:54,828 --> 00:51:59,288
The one that you admired most was
a crystal ball in which a little fish floated.

860
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:02,130
Old Mrs. Post promised this to you
when she died.

861
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:05,194
Then one afternoon
when her daughter was out shopping...

862
00:52:05,272 --> 00:52:08,764
you were alone with the old lady,
she fell down the spiral backstairs...

863
00:52:08,842 --> 00:52:11,402
and broke her neck.
You said she heard a kitten meow...

864
00:52:11,478 --> 00:52:14,606
and went to see what it was
and accidentally missed her footing...

865
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:16,706
and fell five flights to the courtyard below.

866
00:52:16,783 --> 00:52:19,581
- Yes, it's true.
- Later, you asked her daughter...

867
00:52:19,653 --> 00:52:21,951
for the crystal ball, and she gave it to you.

868
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:25,582
- It's still sitting on your treasure chest.
- Yes, Mother.

869
00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:29,353
Rhoda, did you have anything...

870
00:52:29,429 --> 00:52:31,158
I don't care how small it was.

871
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:34,223
Did you have anything to do
with the way Claude got drowned?

872
00:52:34,301 --> 00:52:36,292
- What makes you ask that?
- Come here.

873
00:52:36,369 --> 00:52:38,837
Now look me in the eye
and tell me the truth...

874
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:42,102
- because I must know!
- No, Mother, I didn't!

875
00:52:42,876 --> 00:52:45,208
You're not going back
to the Fern School next year.

876
00:52:45,278 --> 00:52:47,803
- They don't want you anymore.
- Okay.

877
00:52:49,115 --> 00:52:52,209
I'm going to go and call Miss Fern
and have her come over here.

878
00:52:52,285 --> 00:52:54,344
No! She'll think I lied to her!

879
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:58,152
- You did lie to her!
- But not to you, Mother! Not to you!

880
00:53:09,069 --> 00:53:10,866
Hello, Fern School?

881
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,900
Miss Claudia Fern, please.

882
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:19,640
No, no message.

883
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,348
She isn't home yet.

884
00:53:28,088 --> 00:53:31,057
Mother, what are you going to do
with the medal?

885
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,751
It's really mine.

886
00:53:35,595 --> 00:53:38,860
Rhoda, come here to me.

887
00:53:48,775 --> 00:53:50,640
It can't be true.

888
00:53:57,217 --> 00:54:01,347
$0.50, $0.75, $5, and $5 are $10.
Thank you very much, Colonel.

889
00:54:01,421 --> 00:54:04,515
- And here's the card to go in it.
- Yes, Colonel.

890
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,192
None of it will get broken in the mailing?

891
00:54:09,262 --> 00:54:11,787
No, it will be specially packed
in excelsior for that.

892
00:54:11,865 --> 00:54:13,457
Good. Thank you.

893
00:54:21,474 --> 00:54:23,066
Look, a tea set!

894
00:54:23,143 --> 00:54:26,635
I guess we know a daddy
who loves somebody, all right.

895
00:54:26,713 --> 00:54:28,510
What does the card say?

896
00:54:28,581 --> 00:54:32,108
"For no reason, except she's
the sweetest little girl in the world.

897
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,209
"Daddy."

898
00:54:33,286 --> 00:54:36,221
Look, it's got a pot and everything.

899
00:54:36,556 --> 00:54:39,684
Mother, could I take it out
under the arbor for a while?

900
00:54:39,759 --> 00:54:42,319
I want to pretend
I'm giving a garden party.

901
00:54:42,429 --> 00:54:44,795
Yes, dear. And, by the way...

902
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:47,059
unpack it while you're out there, will you?

903
00:54:47,133 --> 00:54:50,728
Because this excelsior is just
getting over everything.

904
00:54:50,804 --> 00:54:54,205
Don't put it down the incinerator
because it's much too large.

905
00:54:54,274 --> 00:54:57,004
Leave it out by the cellar doors
for LeRoy to dispose of.

906
00:54:57,077 --> 00:54:58,135
Yes, Mother.

907
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:01,203
A garden party. Isn't she
the perfect little, old-fashioned girl?

908
00:55:01,281 --> 00:55:05,012
By the way, Miss Emily Post, do you know
you're having supper with me tonight?

909
00:55:05,085 --> 00:55:07,315
Really, Aunt Monica?
Is it a special reason?

910
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:10,379
No. Just that I've invited
Reginald Tasker for cocktails.

911
00:55:10,457 --> 00:55:12,721
You remember, Rhoda,
Granddaddy's coming tonight.

912
00:55:12,792 --> 00:55:16,592
I'm going to have dinner with him.
And that's much too late for you to eat.

913
00:55:16,663 --> 00:55:20,827
- Wasn't that nice of Aunt Monica?
- Of course. Aunt Monica's sweet.

914
00:55:21,101 --> 00:55:24,366
And I'll be glad to see Granddaddy.
He's sweet, too.

915
00:55:25,372 --> 00:55:27,670
I wish she were mine.

916
00:55:28,341 --> 00:55:32,243
Every time I look at her,
I wish I had just such a little girl.

917
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:43,351
There she is at her little table,
playing with her little dishes...

918
00:55:43,523 --> 00:55:45,787
Iooking cute and innocent...

919
00:55:46,192 --> 00:55:49,423
Iooking like she wouldn't melt butter,
she's that cool.

920
00:55:49,496 --> 00:55:52,021
She can fool some people
with that innocent look...

921
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:54,760
she can put on and put off
whenever she wants, but not me.

922
00:55:54,834 --> 00:55:57,394
Not even partway, she can't fool me.

923
00:55:58,738 --> 00:56:00,968
Don't wanna talk to nobody smart?

924
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:02,702
Like to talk to people she can fool...

925
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,904
like her mama and Mrs. Breedlove
and Mr. Emory.

926
00:56:07,847 --> 00:56:11,749
Here's some excelsior for you.
You talk silly all the time.

927
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:14,245
I know what you do with the excelsior.

928
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,550
You made a bed of excelsior...

929
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:19,558
down the basement,
behind that old furnace...

930
00:56:19,726 --> 00:56:22,957
and you sleep there,
where nobody can see you.

931
00:56:24,064 --> 00:56:27,227
I've been way
behind the times heretofore...

932
00:56:27,667 --> 00:56:29,999
but now I got your number, miss.

933
00:56:30,203 --> 00:56:33,468
I've been hearing things about you
that ain't nice.

934
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,702
I heard you beat up
that poor little boy in the woods...

935
00:56:36,776 --> 00:56:39,643
and it took all three of the Fern sisters
to pull you off him.

936
00:56:39,712 --> 00:56:42,340
I heard you run him off the wharf,
he was that scared.

937
00:56:42,415 --> 00:56:46,181
If you tell lies like that,
you won't go to heaven when you die.

938
00:56:46,252 --> 00:56:49,744
I heard plenty.
I listen when people talk, not like you...

939
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:53,088
gabbing all the time,
won't let nobody get a word in edgewise.

940
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,219
That's why I know
what people are saying and you don't.

941
00:56:56,296 --> 00:57:00,858
People tell lies all the time, but I think
you tell them more than anybody else.

942
00:57:00,934 --> 00:57:04,370
I know what you done to that little boy
when you got him on that wharf.

943
00:57:04,437 --> 00:57:07,838
You better listen to me
if you want to stay out of bad trouble.

944
00:57:07,907 --> 00:57:10,569
What did I do, if you know so much?

945
00:57:10,643 --> 00:57:13,874
You picked up a stick,
and you hit him with it.

946
00:57:14,314 --> 00:57:18,273
You hit him with it because he wouldn't
give you that medal, like you told him to.

947
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:21,445
I thought I seen some mean little gals
in my time...

948
00:57:21,988 --> 00:57:23,751
but you're the meanest.

949
00:57:26,226 --> 00:57:29,161
You want to know how I know
how mean you are?

950
00:57:29,462 --> 00:57:31,089
'Cause I'm mean.

951
00:57:31,231 --> 00:57:33,825
I'm smart, and I'm mean.

952
00:57:34,434 --> 00:57:37,028
And you're smart, and you're mean.

953
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,869
And you never get caught,
and I never get caught.

954
00:57:39,939 --> 00:57:41,304
I know what you think.

955
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:45,708
I know everything you think.
Nobody believes anything you say.

956
00:57:45,778 --> 00:57:48,645
You want to know what you done
after you hit him?

957
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:52,811
You jerked the medal off his shirt,
and then you rolled that sweet little boy...

958
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:56,049
- off that wharf among them pilings.
- You don't know anything.

959
00:57:56,122 --> 00:57:57,851
None of what you said is true.

960
00:57:57,924 --> 00:58:00,688
I'm telling the gospel truth,
you know I got it figured out.

961
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,958
You figured out something
that never happened, and so it's all lies.

962
00:58:05,698 --> 00:58:08,166
Now take your excelsior
down to the basement...

963
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:11,203
and sleep on it
when you're supposed to be working.

964
00:58:11,271 --> 00:58:13,671
You ain't no dope, that I must say.

965
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:17,301
That's why you didn't leave that stick
around where nobody could find it.

966
00:58:17,377 --> 00:58:18,605
No.

967
00:58:18,678 --> 00:58:20,976
You got better sense than that.

968
00:58:21,047 --> 00:58:23,277
You took that bloody stick...

969
00:58:24,284 --> 00:58:26,912
washed it off real good,
and you threw it in the woods...

970
00:58:26,986 --> 00:58:31,082
- where nobody could find it.
- You know, I think you're a very silly man.

971
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:35,887
It was you who was silly, thinking
you could wash off blood, and you can't!

972
00:58:37,363 --> 00:58:39,263
Why can't you wash off blood?

973
00:58:39,332 --> 00:58:42,495
Because you can't, and the police know it.

974
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:47,734
You can wash and you can wash,
and there's always some left.

975
00:58:47,807 --> 00:58:49,672
Everybody knows that.

976
00:58:49,909 --> 00:58:52,173
I'm going to call the police and tell them...

977
00:58:52,245 --> 00:58:55,078
to start looking for that stick
in the woods.

978
00:58:56,449 --> 00:59:00,283
They got what they call
"stick bloodhounds" to help them look...

979
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,852
and them stick bloodhounds can find...

980
00:59:02,922 --> 00:59:05,720
any stick there is that's got blood on it.

981
00:59:05,925 --> 00:59:08,519
When they bring in that stick
you washed off so good...

982
00:59:08,595 --> 00:59:12,531
the police are gonna sprinkle
some special blood powder they got on it.

983
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:16,590
That little boy's blood
is gonna show up on that stick.

984
00:59:17,403 --> 00:59:20,930
Gonna show up a pretty blue color,
like a robin's egg.

985
00:59:21,007 --> 00:59:23,100
You're scared about the police yourself.

986
00:59:23,176 --> 00:59:27,306
What you say about me is all about you.
They'll get you with that powder.

987
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,713
Rhoda, it's time to come in now.

988
00:59:31,351 --> 00:59:34,514
- Time to get ready for supper.
- Yes, Mother.

989
00:59:34,887 --> 00:59:38,584
Getting up this excelsior, Mrs. Penmark.
Messing up my lawn here.

990
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:42,219
- What were you saying to Rhoda?
- Why, nothing, Mrs. Penmark.

991
00:59:42,295 --> 00:59:44,490
We was just talking
about her little play dishes.

992
00:59:44,564 --> 00:59:47,727
You're not to talk to her again.
If you do, I'll report you.

993
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,495
Is that entirely clear?

994
00:59:49,569 --> 00:59:50,763
But, ma'am...

995
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:54,273
I started it, Mother.
It wasn't LeRoy's fault.

996
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,773
Very well,
but you're not to talk to her again.

997
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,506
- Do you understand?
- Yes, ma'am.

998
01:00:32,845 --> 01:00:33,971
Mother?

999
01:00:35,348 --> 01:00:38,715
Is it true that when blood
has been washed off anything...

1000
01:00:39,018 --> 01:00:41,816
a policeman can still find if it's there?

1001
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,652
If he sprinkles some powder on the place...

1002
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:47,855
will the place really turn blue?

1003
01:00:48,027 --> 01:00:50,894
Who's been talking to you
about such things? LeRoy?

1004
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,391
No, Mommy, it wasn't he.

1005
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:57,830
I heard some men talking about it
when I was out front this morning.

1006
01:00:58,104 --> 01:01:02,507
I don't know how they'd test for blood,
but I could ask Reginald Tasker.

1007
01:01:02,675 --> 01:01:06,475
- Or Miss Fern, she would know.
- No, don't ask her!

1008
01:01:08,881 --> 01:01:11,406
Mommy, nobody helps me.

1009
01:01:11,651 --> 01:01:13,778
Nobody believes me.

1010
01:01:13,853 --> 01:01:18,051
- I'm your little girl.
- All right, Rhoda. It is not a very good act.

1011
01:01:18,624 --> 01:01:21,957
You may perfect it enough to convince
someone who doesn't know you...

1012
01:01:22,028 --> 01:01:25,464
but right at present,
it is quite easy to see through.

1013
01:01:25,565 --> 01:01:28,056
Maybe I'd better go up to Monica's
and have dinner.

1014
01:01:28,134 --> 01:01:30,034
Yes, she said any time.

1015
01:01:46,586 --> 01:01:48,281
Good evening, Mr. Tasker.

1016
01:01:48,354 --> 01:01:51,050
You can't renege on the invitation now.
I showed up.

1017
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,354
I'm very glad you could come.

1018
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:57,252
- This is my daughter, Rhoda.
- Hello, Rhoda.

1019
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,460
- Isn't she a little sweetheart?
- Thank you.

1020
01:02:03,836 --> 01:02:07,328
That's the kind of thing that makes
an old bachelor wish he were married.

1021
01:02:07,407 --> 01:02:11,867
- You like little girls to curtsy?
- The best thing left out of the Middle Ages.

1022
01:02:11,944 --> 01:02:13,707
I'm having dinner upstairs.

1023
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:16,715
The loss is ours, all ours.

1024
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:20,384
- You may go now, Rhoda.
- Yes, Mommy.

1025
01:02:21,454 --> 01:02:24,617
It's been a pleasure
to have met you, Mr. Tasker.

1026
01:02:32,432 --> 01:02:35,128
Now, there's a little ray of sunshine,
that one.

1027
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:37,533
I've seen her stormy.

1028
01:02:37,603 --> 01:02:38,695
No doubt.

1029
01:02:38,771 --> 01:02:41,706
But she's going to make some man
very happy, just that smile.

1030
01:02:41,774 --> 01:02:44,572
Since I spoke to you,
I've had a wire from my father.

1031
01:02:44,644 --> 01:02:48,080
He's coming here tonight.
It's a whole year since I've seen him.

1032
01:02:48,147 --> 01:02:50,047
Richard Bravo's coming here?

1033
01:02:50,116 --> 01:02:52,243
Now, there's a man
I've always wanted to meet.

1034
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:55,219
He may be here before long.
He said possibly for dinner.

1035
01:02:55,288 --> 01:02:57,779
Good. By the way, dear lady...

1036
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:01,190
if you want advice on writing anything,
you don't need me.

1037
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,524
Not with Richard Bravo on the scene...

1038
01:03:03,596 --> 01:03:06,531
especially if it's a mystery story,
as you said.

1039
01:03:06,933 --> 01:03:11,302
Your father was a real authority
on crime and horror in his early career.

1040
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:12,564
I know.

1041
01:03:12,638 --> 01:03:15,368
He covered every famous case there was.

1042
01:03:15,441 --> 01:03:17,306
I'm afraid he wouldn't listen to me.

1043
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:21,142
You're always an office boy
to your city editor, aren't you?

1044
01:03:21,481 --> 01:03:24,006
- What will it be?
- Gin and tonic?

1045
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:26,142
Good, I'll have that, too.

1046
01:03:29,622 --> 01:03:33,581
The question that I wanted to ask you
is a psychological one.

1047
01:03:33,659 --> 01:03:37,425
I doubt that it's been asked
or answered, if it has, until recently.

1048
01:03:37,497 --> 01:03:39,294
I may not know all the answers.

1049
01:03:39,365 --> 01:03:40,992
Perhaps no one does...

1050
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:46,561
but this story that I'm thinking of writing
made me wonder.

1051
01:03:46,706 --> 01:03:49,937
Tell me,
do children ever commit murders...

1052
01:03:50,009 --> 01:03:52,705
or is crime something
that's learned gradually...

1053
01:03:52,778 --> 01:03:54,678
and grows as the criminal grows...

1054
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:58,080
so that only adults
do really dreadful things?

1055
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:00,710
Yes, children often commit murders.

1056
01:04:00,786 --> 01:04:02,913
And quite clever ones, too.

1057
01:04:02,989 --> 01:04:06,288
Some murderers,
particularly the distinguished ones...

1058
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:09,157
who are going to make great names
for themselves...

1059
01:04:09,228 --> 01:04:11,628
- start amazingly early.
- In childhood?

1060
01:04:11,697 --> 01:04:15,133
Yes, like mathematicians and musicians.

1061
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,300
Poets develop later.

1062
01:04:18,371 --> 01:04:21,204
Pascal was a master mathematician at 12.

1063
01:04:21,641 --> 01:04:24,508
Mozart showed his melodic genius at six.

1064
01:04:25,211 --> 01:04:29,079
And some of our great criminals
were topflight operators...

1065
01:04:29,148 --> 01:04:31,673
before they got out of short pants
and pinafores.

1066
01:04:31,751 --> 01:04:35,050
Yes, but they grew up in the slums,
among criminals...

1067
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:38,215
and learned from their environment.
Surely, you...

1068
01:04:39,659 --> 01:04:42,219
I wonder if that couldn't be Father.

1069
01:04:43,829 --> 01:04:46,024
- Daddy!
- Hi, darling.

1070
01:04:46,766 --> 01:04:50,202
You're here, you're actually here!

1071
01:04:51,037 --> 01:04:52,436
Told you I'd come.

1072
01:04:52,505 --> 01:04:55,269
You said you wanted to see me,
and I wanted to see you.

1073
01:04:55,341 --> 01:04:56,706
I'm so glad.

1074
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:00,976
Father, this is Reginald Tasker.

1075
01:05:02,081 --> 01:05:03,742
Reginald Tasker?

1076
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:06,415
- The writer fella?
- Afraid I stand convicted.

1077
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:09,511
- One of my favorites.
- Put you to sleep regularly?

1078
01:05:09,589 --> 01:05:12,183
Mostly keeps me awake.
Also, I'm not forgetting...

1079
01:05:12,258 --> 01:05:15,489
that impressive research you've done
for the Classic Crime Club.

1080
01:05:15,561 --> 01:05:19,622
Not half as good as the papers
they used to publish by Richard Bravo.

1081
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:21,265
That old dodo?

1082
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:24,428
No, he's written himself out
and talked himself out.

1083
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:28,405
Now he just hobbles around the country,
working for a second-rate news service.

1084
01:05:28,474 --> 01:05:32,376
I took time out because I wanted to see
my long-Iost daughter.

1085
01:05:38,451 --> 01:05:39,884
Where's my granddaughter?

1086
01:05:39,952 --> 01:05:41,977
She's upstairs having dinner, Daddy.

1087
01:05:42,054 --> 01:05:44,921
- She'll be down in a few minutes.
- That's fine.

1088
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:47,022
Sit down.

1089
01:05:47,593 --> 01:05:50,790
Say, any reason I can't have
one of those wicked-Iooking mixtures...

1090
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:52,592
Mr. Tasker's consuming?

1091
01:05:52,665 --> 01:05:54,929
Daddy, I'm sorry.

1092
01:05:55,301 --> 01:05:57,633
You're about ready
for another one, too, aren't you?

1093
01:05:57,703 --> 01:06:01,434
Haven't you ever considered coming back
into the criminology racket?

1094
01:06:01,774 --> 01:06:04,368
There's been nobody like you
since you left.

1095
01:06:05,077 --> 01:06:06,874
All compliments aside...

1096
01:06:06,946 --> 01:06:09,847
my last books didn't sell
as well as my earlier ones...

1097
01:06:09,915 --> 01:06:13,316
and the war came along,
and now I write filler.

1098
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:17,211
You've written some things
that will never be forgotten.

1099
01:06:17,289 --> 01:06:18,517
Let's hope.

1100
01:06:19,158 --> 01:06:22,059
And now your daughter tells me
she's gonna try her hand.

1101
01:06:22,161 --> 01:06:24,561
At writing? She can't even spell.

1102
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:29,030
It gets Ionely here with Kenneth away.

1103
01:06:29,101 --> 01:06:30,762
I thought I might...

1104
01:06:30,836 --> 01:06:33,634
try a murder-mystery during the evenings.

1105
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,501
Are you encouraging
this energetic competition?

1106
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:40,636
I must admit, I didn't quite know
how to answer her first question.

1107
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:42,210
She was asking me...

1108
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:46,012
whether criminal children
are always a product of environment.

1109
01:06:46,118 --> 01:06:48,951
There's nothing difficult
about that, little one. They are.

1110
01:06:49,021 --> 01:06:51,114
I always thought so, too.

1111
01:06:51,657 --> 01:06:52,646
Always.

1112
01:06:52,725 --> 01:06:55,489
I couldn't prove you're wrong,
of course, sir...

1113
01:06:55,561 --> 01:06:59,930
but some fellow criminologists,
including some behavior scientists...

1114
01:06:59,999 --> 01:07:01,728
have begun to make me believe...

1115
01:07:01,801 --> 01:07:04,827
we've all been putting too much emphasis
on environment...

1116
01:07:04,904 --> 01:07:07,031
and too little on heredity.

1117
01:07:07,306 --> 01:07:09,240
They cite a type of criminal...

1118
01:07:09,308 --> 01:07:12,505
born with no capacity
for remorse or guilt...

1119
01:07:12,712 --> 01:07:14,703
no feeling of right or wrong...

1120
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:18,477
born with a kind of brain
that may have been normal in humans...

1121
01:07:18,551 --> 01:07:20,348
fifty thousand years ago.

1122
01:07:20,419 --> 01:07:21,716
Nonsense.

1123
01:07:21,887 --> 01:07:25,414
If you encounter a human
without compassion or pity or morals...

1124
01:07:25,491 --> 01:07:28,016
he grew up where these things
weren't encouraged.

1125
01:07:28,094 --> 01:07:30,392
Or at birth, he received some pitiable...

1126
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,795
physical injuries to the brain tissues.

1127
01:07:33,032 --> 01:07:34,659
Certainly not inherited.

1128
01:07:34,734 --> 01:07:37,931
That's final and absolute for me.
The rest is hogwash.

1129
01:07:38,537 --> 01:07:41,734
And with that outburst,
I terminate for a refill.

1130
01:07:42,942 --> 01:07:43,931
No more ice.

1131
01:07:44,009 --> 01:07:47,206
Daddy, I'm sorry. It's in the kitchen.
Would you mind?

1132
01:07:47,279 --> 01:07:48,405
Certainly not.

1133
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:51,348
Do you really mean to say
that nice family surroundings...

1134
01:07:51,417 --> 01:07:53,783
and advantages
could make no difference at all?

1135
01:07:53,853 --> 01:07:58,552
Yes. It's as if these children
were born blind permanently...

1136
01:07:58,758 --> 01:08:01,522
and you just couldn't expect
to teach them to see.

1137
01:08:01,594 --> 01:08:04,961
Would you notice
any brutish expressions on their faces?

1138
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:08,966
Sometimes, but more often, they present
a more convincing picture...

1139
01:08:09,034 --> 01:08:10,626
of virtue than normal folk.

1140
01:08:10,703 --> 01:08:12,364
But that's horrible.

1141
01:08:12,438 --> 01:08:14,963
It's just that they are bad seeds...

1142
01:08:15,474 --> 01:08:19,137
plain bad from the beginning,
and nothing can change them.

1143
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:22,943
This favorite murderess of yours...

1144
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:26,815
the one you were telling us about
the other afternoon, is she an instance?

1145
01:08:26,886 --> 01:08:30,845
Bessie Denker? Was Bessie a bad seed?

1146
01:08:31,891 --> 01:08:33,984
Well, yes, I should say so...

1147
01:08:34,059 --> 01:08:37,119
because when the full story
of her career came out...

1148
01:08:37,329 --> 01:08:40,423
it was realized that she must have started
at the age of 10.

1149
01:08:40,499 --> 01:08:43,093
- Then she started young?
- Yes.

1150
01:08:43,636 --> 01:08:45,433
Isn't that so, Mr. Bravo?

1151
01:08:45,971 --> 01:08:49,134
- What so?
- We were talking about Bessie Denker.

1152
01:08:49,475 --> 01:08:51,409
I know you covered all her trials...

1153
01:08:51,477 --> 01:08:54,503
because I read your famous essay
listing her methods.

1154
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:57,276
I've forgotten
all about those gloomy cases.

1155
01:08:57,349 --> 01:08:58,873
Put them out of my mind.

1156
01:08:58,951 --> 01:09:02,853
I'm full up with my present prosaic series
on offshore oil.

1157
01:09:02,922 --> 01:09:04,184
How did she end?

1158
01:09:04,256 --> 01:09:07,623
Sweetheart, you don't want to probe
into these nonsensical graveyards.

1159
01:09:07,693 --> 01:09:08,921
Yes, I do.

1160
01:09:08,994 --> 01:09:11,929
Say, Kenneth and I saw the Senators
play the Yankees on Sunday.

1161
01:09:11,997 --> 01:09:14,488
- And that Mickey Mantle...
- Daddy, please.

1162
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:18,662
Mr. Tasker, would you tell me
the rest of the story?

1163
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:21,968
- Did she ever use violence?
- She ended in mystery.

1164
01:09:22,541 --> 01:09:25,738
Just when the authorities
thought they had her dead to rights...

1165
01:09:25,811 --> 01:09:28,143
she disappeared, just vanished.

1166
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,845
She had quite a fortune by then.

1167
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:33,851
There was a rumor
that she went to Australia.

1168
01:09:33,953 --> 01:09:36,251
A similar beauty turned up in Melbourne.

1169
01:09:36,322 --> 01:09:39,519
Her name was Beulah Demerest.

1170
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:43,194
So if it was the same person,
she didn't have to change her initials...

1171
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:44,320
on her linen and silver.

1172
01:09:44,396 --> 01:09:47,695
How could she kill so many
and leave no trace?

1173
01:09:47,967 --> 01:09:51,994
Every time she was indicted,
she just took off for parts unknown...

1174
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:54,172
leaving absolutely no...

1175
01:09:54,874 --> 01:09:56,398
Wait a minute!

1176
01:09:56,742 --> 01:09:59,575
Wasn't there a child, a little girl?

1177
01:09:59,678 --> 01:10:02,875
Never heard of one.
Must be a recent addition to the myth.

1178
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:05,246
There's one more question I'd like to ask.

1179
01:10:05,317 --> 01:10:07,285
Wasn't she ever found out here?

1180
01:10:07,353 --> 01:10:08,945
Not in this country.

1181
01:10:09,321 --> 01:10:12,415
Three juries
looked at that lovely dewy face...

1182
01:10:12,524 --> 01:10:15,652
and heard that melting, cultured voice
and said:

1183
01:10:15,761 --> 01:10:18,229
- "She couldn't have done it."
- She wasn't convicted?

1184
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:20,265
"Not guilty" three times.

1185
01:10:20,332 --> 01:10:22,425
Do you think that she was one of these...

1186
01:10:22,501 --> 01:10:25,334
poor, deformed children,
born without pity?

1187
01:10:25,905 --> 01:10:27,133
Did she...

1188
01:10:28,841 --> 01:10:31,742
Did she did she have an enchanting smile?

1189
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,300
Dazzling, from all accounts.

1190
01:10:33,379 --> 01:10:35,540
- She was doomed?
- Absolutely.

1191
01:10:36,115 --> 01:10:38,515
Doomed to commit murder after murder...

1192
01:10:38,584 --> 01:10:41,382
until somehow or other,
she was found out.

1193
01:10:42,955 --> 01:10:45,822
She'd have been better off
if she'd died young.

1194
01:10:45,891 --> 01:10:48,621
You've been talking tommyrot, Tasker,
and you know it.

1195
01:10:48,794 --> 01:10:52,662
On this not-too-merry
but disputed point, I'll take my leave.

1196
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:55,023
It's been a great pleasure, sir.

1197
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:58,297
I've been lecturing,
so I'm afraid I was the only one to enjoy it.

1198
01:10:58,370 --> 01:10:59,701
Not at all.

1199
01:10:59,772 --> 01:11:02,832
Don't go to any major-league doctor
with that heredity theory.

1200
01:11:02,908 --> 01:11:04,239
They'll shoot it full of holes.

1201
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:06,744
We'll stay off the subject
the next time we meet.

1202
01:11:06,812 --> 01:11:08,837
I'll study up on my baseball.

1203
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:10,572
- Good night.
- Good night.

1204
01:11:11,884 --> 01:11:15,149
- Good night.
- And again, thank you, Mrs. Penmark.

1205
01:11:15,321 --> 01:11:16,549
Good night.

1206
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:22,124
It's nice to be alone again with my girl.

1207
01:11:23,295 --> 01:11:25,855
Are you really planning
to write something?

1208
01:11:26,932 --> 01:11:29,400
I was just asking questions.

1209
01:11:29,802 --> 01:11:33,238
- You saw Kenneth in Washington?
- Yes, he's looking well.

1210
01:11:33,305 --> 01:11:37,207
As well as possible
when a fella's hot, sticky, and tired...

1211
01:11:37,276 --> 01:11:38,675
and most of all, Ionesome.

1212
01:11:38,744 --> 01:11:41,804
We had planned to go somewhere
this summer, but then this...

1213
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,542
sudden change of orders came through...

1214
01:11:46,819 --> 01:11:48,480
Am I looking too close...

1215
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:51,284
or is there something heavy on your mind?

1216
01:11:51,957 --> 01:11:54,517
Does something show in my face?

1217
01:11:55,361 --> 01:11:57,261
Everything shows in your face.

1218
01:11:57,496 --> 01:11:59,123
It always did.

1219
01:11:59,365 --> 01:12:01,458
I don't know if...

1220
01:12:01,533 --> 01:12:05,264
I'm worried about anything
now that you are here.

1221
01:12:06,772 --> 01:12:08,706
I always felt so...

1222
01:12:08,941 --> 01:12:12,342
safe and comfortable
when you were in the room...

1223
01:12:12,711 --> 01:12:14,941
and you have that same effect now.

1224
01:12:15,147 --> 01:12:18,139
To tell you the truth,
you did a magic for me.

1225
01:12:18,817 --> 01:12:21,012
I'd always wanted a little girl...

1226
01:12:21,153 --> 01:12:25,487
and you were everything lovely
a little girl could possibly be for her dad.

1227
01:12:26,892 --> 01:12:28,792
But, Christine, tell me...

1228
01:12:28,861 --> 01:12:30,920
what did you want to ask me?

1229
01:12:31,964 --> 01:12:34,432
Let me think a minute.
Would you like another drink?

1230
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,024
Yes, I guess I would.

1231
01:12:36,201 --> 01:12:39,796
- Can I fix you something?
- No, thank you. I don't want any.

1232
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:43,401
Well, speak up, darling.

1233
01:12:43,842 --> 01:12:46,208
It's between us, whatever it is.

1234
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:53,745
My landlady here...

1235
01:12:54,153 --> 01:12:57,350
is a kind of amateur psychiatrist,
a devotee of Freud's...

1236
01:12:57,423 --> 01:12:59,118
constantly analyzing.

1237
01:12:59,224 --> 01:13:01,954
- I know the type.
- You'll meet her. Her name is Breedlove.

1238
01:13:02,027 --> 01:13:04,894
She's offered a room for you
to stay in while you're here.

1239
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:07,761
Rhoda's upstairs,
having dinner with her right now.

1240
01:13:09,668 --> 01:13:11,829
You were going
to come out with something.

1241
01:13:11,904 --> 01:13:15,305
Yes, what I was going to ask
reminded me of her.

1242
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:20,505
I confessed to her the other day
that I'd always been...

1243
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:24,749
worried about being an adopted child,
and that...

1244
01:13:25,717 --> 01:13:28,277
I was afraid that Mommy
wasn't really my mother...

1245
01:13:28,353 --> 01:13:30,287
and that the Daddy...

1246
01:13:31,223 --> 01:13:33,123
that I love so much...

1247
01:13:33,992 --> 01:13:35,687
wasn't really mine.

1248
01:13:36,361 --> 01:13:38,192
- What did she say?
- She said that it was...

1249
01:13:38,263 --> 01:13:41,323
the commonest of childhood fantasies,
that everybody had it...

1250
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,095
that she'd had it herself.

1251
01:13:44,269 --> 01:13:45,861
It certainly is common.

1252
01:13:45,938 --> 01:13:48,668
Yes, but that doesn't help me,
because, you see...

1253
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:51,265
I still feel that old fear...

1254
01:13:52,111 --> 01:13:54,272
that you're not really mine.

1255
01:13:54,413 --> 01:13:56,847
Has something made you
think about this lately?

1256
01:13:56,915 --> 01:13:58,576
- Yes.
- What is it?

1257
01:13:59,485 --> 01:14:01,180
My little girl Rhoda.

1258
01:14:01,887 --> 01:14:04,412
- What about her?
- Daddy, I'm terrified.

1259
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:07,821
I'm afraid for her.

1260
01:14:08,393 --> 01:14:11,658
I'm afraid of what she might have
inherited from me.

1261
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:14,927
What could she possibly have inherited?
Nothing but sweetness and...

1262
01:14:16,135 --> 01:14:17,432
Father...

1263
01:14:18,403 --> 01:14:20,428
whose child am I?

1264
01:14:20,772 --> 01:14:23,639
- Mine.
- No, Daddy, please don't lie to me now.

1265
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:26,439
It's gone beyond the time
where that will help.

1266
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:31,782
I've told you about a dream I have,
but I'm not sure it's only a dream.

1267
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:34,685
Whose child am I?

1268
01:14:36,188 --> 01:14:37,883
Are you my father?

1269
01:14:39,591 --> 01:14:42,526
I know this is a strange question
to greet you with...

1270
01:14:42,594 --> 01:14:44,619
after having been so long away from you...

1271
01:14:44,696 --> 01:14:47,859
but for Rhoda's sake and my sake,
I must know.

1272
01:14:49,668 --> 01:14:53,297
- What has Rhoda done?
- I don't know, but I'm afraid.

1273
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:55,665
Christine, even if it were true...

1274
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:59,404
just remember, all this inheritance stuff
is pure rubbish.

1275
01:15:02,181 --> 01:15:04,308
All thumbs and webbed feet.

1276
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:08,909
I'm sorry.

1277
01:15:09,888 --> 01:15:12,118
I won't ask any more questions.

1278
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,118
Right, darling.

1279
01:15:18,197 --> 01:15:21,291
Let's just close the book.

1280
01:15:22,701 --> 01:15:24,066
Besides...

1281
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:27,004
I know the answer now.

1282
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:29,134
- Answer?
- Yes.

1283
01:15:33,545 --> 01:15:36,343
Christine, I've been a very fortunate man.

1284
01:15:37,182 --> 01:15:40,208
If it hadn't been for you
becoming part of my life...

1285
01:15:40,352 --> 01:15:43,048
all these years would have been
empty and Ionely...

1286
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:45,055
and unbearable.

1287
01:15:45,891 --> 01:15:50,260
The greatest piece of luck I ever had
was a little girl named Christine.

1288
01:15:50,696 --> 01:15:53,062
You were the only child I ever had.

1289
01:15:53,365 --> 01:15:55,799
As I said, you were magic for me.

1290
01:15:56,068 --> 01:15:59,128
I was happy and proud to keep going,
just for you.

1291
01:15:59,204 --> 01:16:01,138
You don't have to say any more.

1292
01:16:01,206 --> 01:16:03,106
- I don't, do I?
- No.

1293
01:16:04,109 --> 01:16:06,270
You found me somewhere.

1294
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:09,612
Yes.

1295
01:16:10,849 --> 01:16:12,840
In a very strange place.

1296
01:16:13,552 --> 01:16:16,385
- In a strange way.
- Daddy, I know the place.

1297
01:16:17,789 --> 01:16:20,883
I don't think you could have.
You were less than 2 years old.

1298
01:16:20,959 --> 01:16:24,190
Then, if I don't know it,
I guess I must have dreamed it.

1299
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:26,120
What kind of dream?

1300
01:16:28,533 --> 01:16:29,898
Daddy...

1301
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:34,437
I dream of a bedroom in a farmhouse...

1302
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:37,407
in a countryside where there are orchards.

1303
01:16:37,643 --> 01:16:40,339
I share the room with my brother,
who's older than I am.

1304
01:16:40,412 --> 01:16:44,712
One night, somebody... Is it my mother?
She comes to take care of him and...

1305
01:16:46,451 --> 01:16:48,749
She's a lovely lady.

1306
01:16:49,221 --> 01:16:51,212
She's beautiful, like an angel.

1307
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:54,885
Later, I guess my brother must have died
because I'm alone in the room.

1308
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,827
One night, I'm terrified
to be in that room another minute.

1309
01:16:57,896 --> 01:16:59,864
Somehow, I get out of bed, it's moonlight.

1310
01:16:59,931 --> 01:17:02,525
I get out the window,
drop to the ground below...

1311
01:17:02,601 --> 01:17:06,196
and I hide myself in the deep weeds
beyond the first orchard.

1312
01:17:06,271 --> 01:17:10,970
I don't remember very much else,
except that towards morning, I'm thirsty.

1313
01:17:11,143 --> 01:17:15,375
I begin to eat the yellow pippins
that fall from the trees.

1314
01:17:17,416 --> 01:17:20,715
When the first light comes up
on the clouds...

1315
01:17:23,689 --> 01:17:25,782
I can hear my mother's voice...

1316
01:17:25,857 --> 01:17:30,590
calling to me from the distance,
and I don't answer her because I'm afraid.

1317
01:17:30,762 --> 01:17:33,595
Now, is that a dream?
Is that only a dream?

1318
01:17:34,433 --> 01:17:35,957
What name did she call?

1319
01:17:36,034 --> 01:17:39,470
Well, it isn't Christine. Could it be Ingold?

1320
01:17:40,372 --> 01:17:42,567
- You remember that name?
- Yes, Daddy.

1321
01:17:42,641 --> 01:17:45,633
It's coming back to me now. Ingold.

1322
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,310
"Ingold Denker!" she's calling...

1323
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:52,778
Denker!

1324
01:17:56,655 --> 01:17:57,917
Daddy.

1325
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:01,449
You've kept this from me all these years?

1326
01:18:02,194 --> 01:18:06,324
I came out of that terrible household?
That's where you found me?

1327
01:18:07,332 --> 01:18:10,324
The neighbors found you
after your mother disappeared.

1328
01:18:10,402 --> 01:18:12,597
I discovered you with them
before anybody.

1329
01:18:12,671 --> 01:18:15,469
The most astonishingly
sweet and beautiful little thing...

1330
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:18,509
with the most
enchanting smile I've ever seen.

1331
01:18:18,577 --> 01:18:22,308
As Tasker said, I was there covering
the case for a Chicago newspaper.

1332
01:18:22,381 --> 01:18:24,781
I wired my wife, and she joined me.

1333
01:18:26,151 --> 01:18:28,415
- We couldn't resist you.
- Daddy!

1334
01:18:33,225 --> 01:18:35,591
God, help me!

1335
01:18:38,764 --> 01:18:40,994
Why didn't you just leave me there?

1336
01:18:41,066 --> 01:18:43,762
Why didn't I die in the orchard...

1337
01:18:43,835 --> 01:18:45,826
and end the agony there?

1338
01:18:46,838 --> 01:18:49,272
It was the neighbors
who found you and saved you.

1339
01:18:49,341 --> 01:18:51,366
Would you rather have stayed with them?

1340
01:18:51,443 --> 01:18:52,501
No!

1341
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:56,011
You've been a wonderful father.

1342
01:18:57,416 --> 01:19:01,011
It's that awful place and that evil woman!

1343
01:19:01,086 --> 01:19:02,519
My mother!

1344
01:19:02,587 --> 01:19:06,489
There are places and events in
every man's life he'd rather not remember.

1345
01:19:06,558 --> 01:19:09,152
Don't let it hurt you now. It's past.

1346
01:19:09,795 --> 01:19:12,423
I wish I had died then. I wish it.

1347
01:19:12,597 --> 01:19:16,931
It hasn't mattered where you came from.
You've been sound and sweet and loving.

1348
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:20,460
You've given me more
than I ever gave or could ever repay.

1349
01:19:20,572 --> 01:19:23,735
If you'd been my very own,
I couldn't have hoped for more.

1350
01:19:23,809 --> 01:19:26,505
You've known
nothing but love and kindness from us...

1351
01:19:26,578 --> 01:19:30,639
and you've given nothing but love,
kindness, and sweetness all of your life.

1352
01:19:30,916 --> 01:19:33,976
Kenneth loves you,
and you've made him infinitely happy...

1353
01:19:34,052 --> 01:19:36,543
and Rhoda's a sweet,
perfectly sound little girl.

1354
01:19:36,621 --> 01:19:38,680
Is she, Father? Is she?

1355
01:19:40,492 --> 01:19:44,622
- What has she done?
- It's as if she'd been born blind!

1356
01:19:44,696 --> 01:19:47,256
It doesn't happen. It cannot happen.

1357
01:19:52,003 --> 01:19:54,870
Excuse me, please,
but Rhoda has tired of her puzzle...

1358
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:57,204
finished her dinner,
and now she wants a book.

1359
01:19:57,275 --> 01:19:58,970
We haven't even started yet.

1360
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:01,103
And I haven't met Mr. Bravo.

1361
01:20:01,179 --> 01:20:04,376
How do you do?
I'm Mrs. Breedlove, the oversized analyst.

1362
01:20:04,549 --> 01:20:07,643
I'm going to put you up,
and I promise not to annoy you.

1363
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:10,882
You know what newspapermen are like:
crusty, bitter, irascible.

1364
01:20:10,956 --> 01:20:14,323
- lf you can put up with me, you're a saint.
- Granddaddy!

1365
01:20:14,392 --> 01:20:16,883
- Rhoda.
- Isn't she perfection?

1366
01:20:17,796 --> 01:20:20,230
Next to Daddy, you lift me up best.

1367
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:27,501
Why do you look at me?

1368
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:32,236
I just want to see your face.

1369
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:36,576
Mr. Bravo, these Penmarks are the
most enchanting neighbors I've ever had.

1370
01:20:36,648 --> 01:20:38,912
Now I'll want Rhoda for dinner every night.

1371
01:20:38,984 --> 01:20:40,349
Thank you, Aunt Monica.

1372
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:43,717
Tell me, Mr. Bravo,
didn't you write the Fingerprint series?

1373
01:20:43,788 --> 01:20:46,348
I'm afraid I was guilty of that
about 20 years ago.

1374
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:50,588
I read the first volume to pieces,
and wept over it...

1375
01:20:50,829 --> 01:20:54,993
till the parts I loved most were illegible,
then bought another.

1376
01:20:55,634 --> 01:20:58,933
- Well, I finally met my public.
- I don't disappoint you?

1377
01:20:59,137 --> 01:21:00,832
Anyway, I'm large.

1378
01:21:00,906 --> 01:21:04,398
I like people who read books to pieces.
It's good for royalties.

1379
01:21:06,478 --> 01:21:08,844
It's time I began to get our dinner.

1380
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:11,471
I better find my room
and get ready for the evening.

1381
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:13,450
I'll take you up, if you care to go now.

1382
01:21:13,518 --> 01:21:16,043
- lf you'll be so kind.
- It's the next floor above.

1383
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:17,679
Good night, Christine.

1384
01:22:27,687 --> 01:22:29,848
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1385
01:22:32,024 --> 01:22:34,049
Is that for the incinerator?

1386
01:22:34,127 --> 01:22:35,890
- Yes.
- But what is it?

1387
01:22:36,295 --> 01:22:38,661
It's just some things you told me
to throw away.

1388
01:22:38,731 --> 01:22:39,720
No!

1389
01:22:40,099 --> 01:22:42,659
- Let me see what's in the package.
- No! Give me that!

1390
01:22:42,735 --> 01:22:46,136
- Let me see what's in the...
- Give it!

1391
01:22:48,441 --> 01:22:52,275
- Let me see what's in the package.
- Give me that!

1392
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:07,152
You hit him with the shoes, didn't you?

1393
01:23:07,293 --> 01:23:10,729
You hit him with the shoes. That's how
he got those half-moon marks...

1394
01:23:10,796 --> 01:23:12,991
on his forehead and on his hands!

1395
01:23:13,466 --> 01:23:15,229
Answer me, Rhoda.

1396
01:23:15,868 --> 01:23:17,495
Answer me!

1397
01:23:18,304 --> 01:23:20,238
I hit him with the shoes.

1398
01:23:20,306 --> 01:23:22,069
I had to hit him with the shoes!

1399
01:23:22,141 --> 01:23:25,872
- What else could I do?
- Do you realize that you murdered him?

1400
01:23:25,945 --> 01:23:27,640
But it was his fault!

1401
01:23:27,713 --> 01:23:31,911
If he gave me the medal like I told him to,
I wouldn't have hit him!

1402
01:23:33,886 --> 01:23:35,080
All right.

1403
01:23:36,189 --> 01:23:37,679
All right, now.

1404
01:23:38,891 --> 01:23:41,951
We'll start at the beginning,
and you'll tell me the truth.

1405
01:23:42,028 --> 01:23:44,223
I know you killed him,
so there's no sense lying.

1406
01:23:44,297 --> 01:23:46,265
Rhoda, I want you to tell me the truth!

1407
01:23:46,332 --> 01:23:50,029
- I can't tell you, Mother.
- I want you to...

1408
01:23:52,004 --> 01:23:54,165
I'm waiting for your answer.

1409
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:04,911
He wouldn't give me the medal
like I told him to, that's all.

1410
01:24:05,017 --> 01:24:08,646
So then he ran away from me
and hid on the wharf.

1411
01:24:09,855 --> 01:24:11,618
But I found him there...

1412
01:24:11,724 --> 01:24:16,184
and I told him I'd hit him with my shoe
if he didn't give me the medal!

1413
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:19,664
But he shook his head and said no.

1414
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:22,134
So I hit him the first time.

1415
01:24:22,335 --> 01:24:25,133
Then he took off the medal
and gave it to me.

1416
01:24:27,173 --> 01:24:28,663
And then what happened?

1417
01:24:29,442 --> 01:24:31,171
He tried to run away from me.

1418
01:24:31,244 --> 01:24:33,735
So I hit him with my shoe again!

1419
01:24:35,314 --> 01:24:38,112
But he kept on crying
and making a noise...

1420
01:24:38,417 --> 01:24:40,510
and I was afraid
somebody would hear him...

1421
01:24:40,586 --> 01:24:43,077
so I kept on hitting him, Mother!

1422
01:24:45,258 --> 01:24:47,385
I hit him harder that time...

1423
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,489
and he fell in the water.

1424
01:24:49,829 --> 01:24:52,389
My God.

1425
01:24:56,002 --> 01:24:57,970
What are we going to do?

1426
01:25:07,013 --> 01:25:09,538
I've got the prettiest mother.

1427
01:25:10,116 --> 01:25:14,052
- I've got the nicest mother.
- How did...

1428
01:25:14,887 --> 01:25:19,085
How did the marks
get on the backs of his hands?

1429
01:25:20,926 --> 01:25:23,520
He tried to pull himself
back on the wharf...

1430
01:25:23,596 --> 01:25:25,564
after he fell in the water.

1431
01:25:26,032 --> 01:25:28,262
I wouldn't have hit him anymore.

1432
01:25:29,168 --> 01:25:32,626
Only he kept saying
he was going to tell on me.

1433
01:25:33,172 --> 01:25:36,972
Mommy, please say
you won't let them hurt me!

1434
01:25:38,377 --> 01:25:40,607
I won't let them hurt you.

1435
01:25:41,947 --> 01:25:44,313
I don't know what must be done now...

1436
01:25:44,383 --> 01:25:47,181
but I promise you nobody will hurt you.

1437
01:25:51,857 --> 01:25:54,291
I want to play the way
we used to, Mommy.

1438
01:25:54,493 --> 01:25:56,256
Will you play with me?

1439
01:25:59,365 --> 01:26:02,266
- lf I give you a basket of kisses...
- Rhoda, please.

1440
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:07,737
- Please.
- Can't you give me an answer, Mother?

1441
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:11,607
- lf I give you a basket of kisses...
- Rhoda, I want you to...

1442
01:26:12,244 --> 01:26:15,304
I want you to go in your bedroom now
and read...

1443
01:26:15,548 --> 01:26:18,312
because I have to think about what to do.

1444
01:26:18,751 --> 01:26:22,346
Promise me you won't tell anyone
what you've told me. Do you understand?

1445
01:26:22,455 --> 01:26:24,355
Why would I tell and get killed?

1446
01:26:24,423 --> 01:26:25,822
Rhoda!

1447
01:26:27,393 --> 01:26:30,157
What happened
to old Mrs. Post in Wichita?

1448
01:26:36,836 --> 01:26:39,100
There was ice on the steps...

1449
01:26:39,171 --> 01:26:41,765
and I slipped and fell against her...

1450
01:26:42,174 --> 01:26:43,641
and that was all.

1451
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:46,043
That was all?

1452
01:26:47,546 --> 01:26:48,535
No.

1453
01:26:49,482 --> 01:26:51,347
I slipped on purpose.

1454
01:26:55,287 --> 01:26:57,152
Rhoda, get the shoes.

1455
01:26:57,757 --> 01:27:00,317
Get the shoes and put them
in the incinerator. Hurry!

1456
01:27:00,393 --> 01:27:03,021
Put them in the incinerator
and burn them!

1457
01:27:05,364 --> 01:27:09,596
- What will you do with the medal, Mother?
- I'll think of something to do.

1458
01:27:09,668 --> 01:27:11,932
You won't give it to Miss Fern?

1459
01:27:12,571 --> 01:27:13,560
No.

1460
01:27:14,173 --> 01:27:16,403
I won't give it to Miss Fern.

1461
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:53,578
So your grandpappy finally left?

1462
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:57,272
My mother and I just came
from taking him to the plane.

1463
01:27:57,349 --> 01:27:59,214
That's really none of your business.

1464
01:27:59,351 --> 01:28:01,649
Maybe he don't like you so much.

1465
01:28:01,987 --> 01:28:04,319
Maybe he sees through you, like I do.

1466
01:28:05,024 --> 01:28:06,889
You know so much.

1467
01:28:06,992 --> 01:28:10,894
His editor called from long distance,
and he had to go to work...

1468
01:28:10,963 --> 01:28:12,794
and you better do yours.

1469
01:28:13,566 --> 01:28:16,467
I found out about one lie that you told.

1470
01:28:16,969 --> 01:28:20,735
There is no such thing
as a stick bloodhound.

1471
01:28:22,341 --> 01:28:24,832
I ain't supposed to talk
to little Miss Goody-Goody.

1472
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:26,138
Then don't.

1473
01:28:26,979 --> 01:28:28,412
Where's your mama?

1474
01:28:28,881 --> 01:28:32,681
She had to go back to the grocery store.
That's none of your business, either.

1475
01:28:32,751 --> 01:28:34,480
And I'm busy with my puzzle.

1476
01:28:34,653 --> 01:28:36,052
Puzzle?

1477
01:28:36,255 --> 01:28:39,247
You don't puzzle me none,
Little Miss Sweet-Iooking.

1478
01:28:39,325 --> 01:28:41,623
For your own sake, I'll tell you something.

1479
01:28:41,694 --> 01:28:44,993
There may be no stick bloodhound,
but there's a stick, all right.

1480
01:28:45,064 --> 01:28:49,398
You better find that stick before they do,
'cause they're going to turn blue.

1481
01:28:49,468 --> 01:28:52,130
Then they're gonna fry you
in the electric chair.

1482
01:28:52,204 --> 01:28:55,571
There isn't any stick any more than
there's a stick bloodhound.

1483
01:28:55,641 --> 01:28:58,235
You know the noise
the electric chair makes?

1484
01:28:58,777 --> 01:29:00,176
It goes...

1485
01:29:01,046 --> 01:29:05,107
When that juice hits you,
it parts your hair neat.

1486
01:29:07,386 --> 01:29:09,013
Like lightning struck you.

1487
01:29:09,088 --> 01:29:11,147
Go on with your lawnmower.

1488
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:13,915
They don't put little girls
in the electric chair.

1489
01:29:13,993 --> 01:29:15,358
They don't?

1490
01:29:16,228 --> 01:29:19,959
They got a little blue chair for little boys...

1491
01:29:20,666 --> 01:29:23,396
and a little pink chair for little girls.

1492
01:29:29,742 --> 01:29:31,903
I just remembered something.

1493
01:29:32,745 --> 01:29:36,977
Just the morning of the picnic,
I wiped off your shoes with the cleats.

1494
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:40,775
You used to go tapping on the walk.

1495
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:43,652
How come you don't wear them anymore?

1496
01:29:43,722 --> 01:29:45,121
You're silly.

1497
01:29:45,190 --> 01:29:47,249
I never had a pair of shoes like that.

1498
01:29:47,326 --> 01:29:49,988
You used to go tapping on the walk.

1499
01:29:50,062 --> 01:29:52,394
I'd squirt water on them
and you'd wiped them off.

1500
01:29:52,464 --> 01:29:55,228
They hurt my feet, and I gave them away.

1501
01:29:56,569 --> 01:29:58,264
You know something?

1502
01:30:00,706 --> 01:30:03,402
You didn't hit that little boy with no stick.

1503
01:30:03,542 --> 01:30:05,510
You hit him with them shoes.

1504
01:30:06,211 --> 01:30:08,839
- Ain't I right this time?
- You're silly.

1505
01:30:09,848 --> 01:30:12,408
You think I'm silly
'cause I said about the stick.

1506
01:30:12,484 --> 01:30:15,976
I was trying to make you say,
"It wasn't the stick, it was my shoes."

1507
01:30:16,055 --> 01:30:19,388
- I knew what it was.
- You lie all the time.

1508
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:21,892
How come I got those shoes, then?

1509
01:30:23,329 --> 01:30:24,660
Where did you get them?

1510
01:30:24,730 --> 01:30:28,723
Just walked right into the apartment,
right into your room and took them.

1511
01:30:28,801 --> 01:30:32,828
It's just more lies,
'cause I burned those shoes.

1512
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:35,939
I put them down the incinerator
and burned them.

1513
01:30:36,008 --> 01:30:37,373
Nobody's got them.

1514
01:30:38,744 --> 01:30:41,235
I don't say that ain't smart, 'cause it is.

1515
01:30:42,748 --> 01:30:47,447
Only suppose I say I heard something
come rattling down the incinerator...

1516
01:30:47,519 --> 01:30:51,421
and I says to myself, "Sounds to me
like a pair of shoes with cleats."

1517
01:30:53,592 --> 01:30:55,958
I don't say you didn't burn them a little...

1518
01:30:56,028 --> 01:30:58,963
but you didn't burn them all up
like you wanted to.

1519
01:30:59,031 --> 01:31:01,022
- Yes.
- You listen, then figure out...

1520
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:02,795
which of us is the silly one.

1521
01:31:03,402 --> 01:31:07,395
I'm working down the cellar, and I hear
them shoes come down that incinerator.

1522
01:31:07,473 --> 01:31:09,668
I open the door quick, and there they is...

1523
01:31:09,742 --> 01:31:13,303
sitting on top of the coals,
only smoking the least little bit.

1524
01:31:13,379 --> 01:31:14,937
I pull them out.

1525
01:31:16,582 --> 01:31:18,243
They're scorched.

1526
01:31:18,317 --> 01:31:20,285
Sure, they're scorched...

1527
01:31:20,352 --> 01:31:22,752
but there's plenty left to turn blue...

1528
01:31:23,188 --> 01:31:25,952
and show where
that little boy's blood was.

1529
01:31:26,458 --> 01:31:29,689
Plenty left to put you in the electric chair.

1530
01:31:30,195 --> 01:31:33,255
- Give me those shoes back!
- Oh, no.

1531
01:31:33,332 --> 01:31:37,393
I got them shoes hid
where nobody but me can find them.

1532
01:31:37,469 --> 01:31:41,565
You better give me those shoes.
They're mine. Give them back to me.

1533
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:44,234
I ain't giving them shoes back to nobody.

1534
01:31:44,309 --> 01:31:47,005
You'd better give them back to me, LeRoy!

1535
01:31:47,079 --> 01:31:49,206
I'm keeping them shoes.

1536
01:31:53,986 --> 01:31:56,716
Who says I got anybody's shoes
except my own?

1537
01:31:56,789 --> 01:31:58,984
You did! You get them,
and give them back!

1538
01:31:59,058 --> 01:32:02,323
I'm fooling you, I'm teasing you.
I got nobody's shoes.

1539
01:32:03,162 --> 01:32:05,892
- I got work to do.
- Give me back my shoes!

1540
01:32:05,964 --> 01:32:08,262
Don't you know
when anybody's teasing you?

1541
01:32:08,333 --> 01:32:09,960
Will you bring them back?

1542
01:32:10,035 --> 01:32:12,560
Play with your puzzle.
I got no shoes, I tell you.

1543
01:32:12,638 --> 01:32:14,435
You bring them back!

1544
01:32:15,908 --> 01:32:17,739
I believe you did it.

1545
01:32:18,210 --> 01:32:21,509
I was fooling before,
but now I believe you killed him.

1546
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:24,244
You killed that little boy with your shoes.

1547
01:32:24,316 --> 01:32:26,580
You've got them hid...

1548
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:29,654
but you'd better get them
and bring them back here...

1549
01:32:29,722 --> 01:32:31,417
right here to me!

1550
01:32:34,626 --> 01:32:36,890
- What is LeRoy saying to you?
- Nothing.

1551
01:32:36,962 --> 01:32:40,056
I heard you yelling,
"Bring them back here."

1552
01:32:40,132 --> 01:32:41,963
He said he had my shoes.

1553
01:32:42,034 --> 01:32:44,264
I got nobody's shoes, Miss Penmark.

1554
01:32:46,038 --> 01:32:47,630
You may go, LeRoy.

1555
01:32:48,207 --> 01:32:49,435
Yes, ma'am.

1556
01:32:52,177 --> 01:32:54,338
There you are.
May I come down a minute?

1557
01:32:54,413 --> 01:32:57,541
I have that present I promised
a certain precious somebody.

1558
01:32:58,517 --> 01:33:01,577
- Yes, of course, Monica.
- I'll be right down.

1559
01:33:02,154 --> 01:33:03,280
Rhoda...

1560
01:33:05,157 --> 01:33:07,819
I thought I told you
not to discuss this with anybody.

1561
01:33:07,893 --> 01:33:11,989
- Yes, but he said he had my...
- We'll talk about it later. Get upstairs.

1562
01:33:51,303 --> 01:33:54,295
Rhoda! Look what I have for you.

1563
01:33:54,373 --> 01:33:58,400
- What is it? The locket.
- My smart little darling, exactly.

1564
01:33:58,477 --> 01:34:02,436
- And here's the garnet, too, in there.
- How pretty.

1565
01:34:02,915 --> 01:34:07,545
- Will you help me fasten it, Aunt Monica?
- Yes, I will, darling. Come over here.

1566
01:34:09,855 --> 01:34:13,484
Now you're going to look
just like a little princess.

1567
01:34:21,667 --> 01:34:23,294
It's the ice-cream man.

1568
01:34:23,368 --> 01:34:25,859
Mommy, can I have a Popsicle?

1569
01:34:27,506 --> 01:34:29,736
- What?
- Can I have a Popsicle?

1570
01:34:32,878 --> 01:34:35,847
Yes, take the money from my purse.

1571
01:34:42,855 --> 01:34:44,152
Rhoda!

1572
01:34:46,258 --> 01:34:48,749
What have you got those for?

1573
01:34:49,194 --> 01:34:51,719
I just wanted some
to play jackstraws with.

1574
01:34:51,797 --> 01:34:55,756
Put them down this minute.
You know we have a rule about that.

1575
01:34:59,204 --> 01:35:00,637
Yes, Mother.

1576
01:35:20,192 --> 01:35:22,854
Why, it's so hot today!

1577
01:35:23,061 --> 01:35:24,153
Christine.

1578
01:35:25,864 --> 01:35:28,492
Christine, you won't mind
if I'm nosy and ridiculous...

1579
01:35:28,567 --> 01:35:30,467
but you haven't been yourself lately.

1580
01:35:30,535 --> 01:35:33,197
It's as if something is dragging you down.

1581
01:35:33,272 --> 01:35:34,864
Does it show to other people?

1582
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:39,138
- Then there is something wrong.
- No, Monica. Not really.

1583
01:35:41,146 --> 01:35:43,137
I'm just tired, I guess.

1584
01:35:43,482 --> 01:35:45,643
Do you take vitamins regularly?

1585
01:35:46,418 --> 01:35:48,010
No, I don't.

1586
01:35:48,086 --> 01:35:50,850
You should, darling.
That's one of the things we do know.

1587
01:35:50,923 --> 01:35:54,586
I have an awfully good combination.
I'll bring some down if I may.

1588
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:58,323
And now you must really forgive me...

1589
01:35:58,530 --> 01:36:01,431
but have you and Kenneth
come to a parting of the ways?

1590
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:04,367
His being transferred to Washington
didn't mean that?

1591
01:36:04,436 --> 01:36:07,803
- No.
- It can happen in marriage, you know.

1592
01:36:07,873 --> 01:36:11,400
That restlessness in cycles
of seven or eight years, they say.

1593
01:36:11,476 --> 01:36:13,501
Something to do with hormones.

1594
01:36:13,812 --> 01:36:15,609
I can't speak from experience...

1595
01:36:15,681 --> 01:36:18,878
because I always doubted
if Mr. Breedlove had any.

1596
01:36:21,019 --> 01:36:24,318
No, Monica. It isn't anything like that.

1597
01:36:25,257 --> 01:36:28,624
I wish I were as sure of other things
as I am of Kenneth.

1598
01:36:29,161 --> 01:36:30,924
Do you sleep enough?

1599
01:36:31,897 --> 01:36:33,489
No, not always.

1600
01:36:33,632 --> 01:36:37,159
You must have some sleeping pills.
That much we can do.

1601
01:36:39,404 --> 01:36:42,601
I really don't like sleeping pills.
I'm afraid of them.

1602
01:36:42,741 --> 01:36:45,642
I'm not going
to bully you anymore, dear Christine.

1603
01:36:46,278 --> 01:36:48,838
I'm only going to say that I love you.

1604
01:36:49,481 --> 01:36:51,915
Truly I do, darling.

1605
01:36:52,751 --> 01:36:55,811
Please, tell me what it is.

1606
01:36:57,189 --> 01:36:59,851
- I can't, Monica.
- Please, you can trust me.

1607
01:36:59,925 --> 01:37:03,326
- I can't tell anyone.
- Dear Christine.

1608
01:37:04,396 --> 01:37:06,387
You'll feel better now.

1609
01:37:07,032 --> 01:37:09,500
Perhaps you can get some rest.

1610
01:37:09,701 --> 01:37:10,759
Perhaps...

1611
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:17,732
There now, dear.
I'll get rid of whoever it is.

1612
01:37:22,581 --> 01:37:24,572
Wait a minute.

1613
01:37:30,055 --> 01:37:32,319
Well, Mrs. Breedlove.

1614
01:37:33,191 --> 01:37:34,180
Hi.

1615
01:37:39,264 --> 01:37:41,630
I know you don't want me here.
I don't, either.

1616
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:45,067
But I can't stay away,
so I got a little drunk and came over.

1617
01:37:45,137 --> 01:37:47,571
- Excuse me, please.
- You're very welcome.

1618
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:49,764
Like a skunk, I know.

1619
01:37:49,841 --> 01:37:53,106
Mrs. Breedlove knows everyone,
knows even me.

1620
01:37:53,645 --> 01:37:55,306
How are you, Mrs. Daigle?

1621
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:58,213
Well, I'm half-seas over.

1622
01:37:59,951 --> 01:38:01,942
I want to have a talk with your little girl.

1623
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:04,488
She was one of the last
to see my Claude alive.

1624
01:38:04,556 --> 01:38:05,580
I know.

1625
01:38:06,024 --> 01:38:09,721
Where do you keep the perfect little lady
who was the last to see Claude?

1626
01:38:09,795 --> 01:38:11,660
I thought I'd hold her in my arms...

1627
01:38:11,730 --> 01:38:14,927
and we'd have a little talk,
maybe she'd remember some little thing.

1628
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,297
Any little thing.

1629
01:38:16,368 --> 01:38:18,666
She's out playing, I think.

1630
01:38:19,337 --> 01:38:21,328
I'm unfortunate, that's all.

1631
01:38:22,074 --> 01:38:24,565
Drunk and unfortunate,
ladies and gentlemen.

1632
01:38:27,479 --> 01:38:30,073
She isn't there now. I don't see her.

1633
01:38:30,315 --> 01:38:32,476
She's a perfect little lady.

1634
01:38:32,751 --> 01:38:34,048
That's what I heard.

1635
01:38:34,519 --> 01:38:36,282
Never gives any trouble.

1636
01:38:38,123 --> 01:38:41,422
Christine, have you got
anything in the house to drink?

1637
01:38:41,493 --> 01:38:44,621
Any little thing at all.
I'm not the fussy type.

1638
01:38:45,697 --> 01:38:49,497
I prefer bourbon and water,
but any little thing will do.

1639
01:38:51,837 --> 01:38:53,634
Ain't we swank?

1640
01:38:55,173 --> 01:38:57,607
Really Plaza and Astor.

1641
01:38:58,610 --> 01:39:02,273
I want to have a little talk with Rhoda
'cause she knows something.

1642
01:39:04,483 --> 01:39:07,941
I called that Miss Fern on the telephone
a dozen times.

1643
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:10,552
She just keeps giving me the brush-off.

1644
01:39:10,755 --> 01:39:13,053
She knows something, all right.

1645
01:39:13,758 --> 01:39:16,192
Are you all right there?

1646
01:39:17,829 --> 01:39:20,389
I'm not intoxicated in the slightest degree.

1647
01:39:20,465 --> 01:39:22,057
Kindly don't talk down to me.

1648
01:39:22,134 --> 01:39:24,694
I've been through enough without that.

1649
01:39:28,773 --> 01:39:32,140
- I brought back change, Mother.
- Very well.

1650
01:39:33,145 --> 01:39:35,306
Mrs. Daigle would like to see you.

1651
01:39:36,414 --> 01:39:38,780
So this is your little girl.

1652
01:39:40,952 --> 01:39:43,216
Claude spoke of you so often...

1653
01:39:43,989 --> 01:39:45,513
and in such high terms.

1654
01:39:45,590 --> 01:39:48,150
You were one of
his dearest friends, I'm sure.

1655
01:39:48,226 --> 01:39:50,717
He said you were so bright in school.

1656
01:39:51,463 --> 01:39:54,193
- So you're Rhoda.
- Yes.

1657
01:39:54,366 --> 01:39:57,335
Rhoda, you just come
right over here and see me.

1658
01:39:57,602 --> 01:40:00,366
Come give your Aunt Hortense a big kiss.

1659
01:40:10,649 --> 01:40:13,516
You're the one who was
with Claude when he had his accident...

1660
01:40:13,585 --> 01:40:15,314
aren't you, darling?

1661
01:40:15,387 --> 01:40:18,185
You thought you were gonna win
that penmanship medal...

1662
01:40:18,256 --> 01:40:20,520
and worked so hard,
but didn't win it, did you?

1663
01:40:20,592 --> 01:40:22,287
Claude won it, didn't he?

1664
01:40:24,062 --> 01:40:25,586
Now you tell me this.

1665
01:40:26,264 --> 01:40:28,459
Would you say he won it fair and square...

1666
01:40:28,533 --> 01:40:30,057
or he cheated?

1667
01:40:31,169 --> 01:40:34,002
These things are so important to me
now that he's dead.

1668
01:40:34,072 --> 01:40:36,040
Would you say he won it fair, darling?

1669
01:40:36,107 --> 01:40:39,372
'Cause if he did win it fair,
then why did you go after him for it?

1670
01:40:39,444 --> 01:40:40,672
I want my Popsicle.

1671
01:40:40,745 --> 01:40:44,977
Let's go shopping now.
Mr. Finchley will show us his collection.

1672
01:40:45,050 --> 01:40:46,677
- Right now?
- Yes. We're late as it is.

1673
01:40:46,751 --> 01:40:49,413
Take your Popsicle, dear.
You can wash upstairs.

1674
01:40:49,621 --> 01:40:52,886
- Well, I must say...
- They really did have an appointment.

1675
01:40:52,958 --> 01:40:54,425
I'm sure they did.

1676
01:40:56,695 --> 01:40:58,128
Practically sure.

1677
01:40:59,864 --> 01:41:02,833
I didn't know Rhoda had
all these social obligations.

1678
01:41:03,935 --> 01:41:07,666
Thought she was like any little girl that
stayed home and minded her mother...

1679
01:41:07,739 --> 01:41:11,368
and didn't go traipsing all over town
with important appointments.

1680
01:41:11,443 --> 01:41:14,640
I'm sorry that I interfered
with Rhoda's social life.

1681
01:41:15,914 --> 01:41:18,849
I offer you
my deepest apologies, Christine.

1682
01:41:18,917 --> 01:41:22,683
I'll apologize to Rhoda, too,
when I can have an interview with her.

1683
01:41:24,489 --> 01:41:26,457
You haven't interfered at all.

1684
01:41:28,026 --> 01:41:30,187
I was not going to contaminate Rhoda...

1685
01:41:30,262 --> 01:41:32,958
in the slightest degree, I assure you.

1686
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:36,460
Hello?

1687
01:41:40,305 --> 01:41:42,830
Yes, Mr. Daigle, I know. She's here.

1688
01:41:44,542 --> 01:41:46,100
No, not at all.

1689
01:41:48,813 --> 01:41:52,180
Did you tell him I was drunk
and making a spectacle of myself?

1690
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:54,741
Did you tell him to call out
the patrol wagon?

1691
01:41:54,819 --> 01:41:58,585
No, you heard what I said.
I said only that you were here.

1692
01:41:59,090 --> 01:42:01,991
Your husband is at the drugstore
at the corner.

1693
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:05,655
I was only gonna hold her in my arms
and ask her a few simple questions.

1694
01:42:05,730 --> 01:42:08,858
- Perhaps another time would be better.
- You think because I'm lit?

1695
01:42:08,933 --> 01:42:11,026
I'm not lit.
Rhoda knows more than she's told...

1696
01:42:11,102 --> 01:42:12,865
if you don't mind me being presumptuous!

1697
01:42:12,937 --> 01:42:15,167
I had a talk with that guard
since I saw you last.

1698
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:18,835
That was an interesting conversation.
He said he saw Rhoda on the pier...

1699
01:42:18,910 --> 01:42:21,538
just before Claude was found
among the pilings.

1700
01:42:21,613 --> 01:42:23,672
She knows something, all right.

1701
01:42:25,717 --> 01:42:27,412
I know what you're thinking.

1702
01:42:27,485 --> 01:42:30,613
You're thinking,
"How can I get rid of this pest?"

1703
01:42:31,423 --> 01:42:33,584
You may fool some
with that mealy mouth.

1704
01:42:33,658 --> 01:42:36,388
You look like Ned in the primer to me.

1705
01:42:38,163 --> 01:42:39,687
Well, then...

1706
01:42:40,198 --> 01:42:42,894
perhaps you'd better not
come here anymore.

1707
01:42:45,003 --> 01:42:48,495
I wouldn't come here again
for a million dollars laid on the line.

1708
01:42:48,573 --> 01:42:53,374
I wouldn't have come here this time if I'd
known about Rhoda's social obligations.

1709
01:42:53,445 --> 01:42:55,413
I am going home.

1710
01:42:56,414 --> 01:42:58,348
I'm not going to wait for Mr. Daigle.

1711
01:42:58,416 --> 01:43:01,249
I know where I'm not wanted,
and I'm not wanted anyplace...

1712
01:43:01,319 --> 01:43:05,221
where people have all these
social obligations, if you get what I mean.

1713
01:43:08,927 --> 01:43:11,623
Say, you're looking kind of
sick and sloppy.

1714
01:43:13,932 --> 01:43:16,298
Why don't you come up to my house...

1715
01:43:16,368 --> 01:43:18,563
and I'll give you a free beauty treatment?

1716
01:43:18,636 --> 01:43:22,470
If you're hard-pressed for ready cash,
it won't cost you a nickel.

1717
01:43:35,053 --> 01:43:37,078
Thank you, Mrs. Penmark.

1718
01:43:40,625 --> 01:43:43,253
Come, Hortense. It's time to go home.

1719
01:43:50,135 --> 01:43:53,366
My God, it's time to go home.

1720
01:43:55,173 --> 01:43:57,733
Christine, you know something!

1721
01:43:58,877 --> 01:44:01,812
You know something you won't tell me.

1722
01:44:23,768 --> 01:44:25,167
Operator.

1723
01:44:27,205 --> 01:44:28,968
I want to call...

1724
01:44:30,642 --> 01:44:33,907
Washington D. C...

1725
01:44:33,978 --> 01:44:35,309
please.

1726
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:39,409
Kenneth, my darling, my love.

1727
01:44:40,585 --> 01:44:43,179
What am I going to say to you?

1728
01:44:45,123 --> 01:44:46,613
That our baby is...

1729
01:44:52,330 --> 01:44:54,491
Never mind it, operator.

1730
01:44:55,467 --> 01:44:57,094
Cancel the call.

1731
01:45:00,738 --> 01:45:02,171
Good. She's gone.

1732
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:05,468
I know I shouldn't take things
into my all-too-capable hands...

1733
01:45:05,543 --> 01:45:08,103
but I couldn't
let her paw Rhoda any longer.

1734
01:45:08,746 --> 01:45:10,680
Mr. Daigle came for her.

1735
01:45:10,748 --> 01:45:14,184
And I fear I've loosened the discipline
just a little.

1736
01:45:14,252 --> 01:45:16,880
I let Rhoda go out for another Popsicle.

1737
01:45:16,955 --> 01:45:19,389
She wanted a second? That's unusual.

1738
01:45:19,457 --> 01:45:22,221
She seemed quite eager,
and since she's not one of these...

1739
01:45:22,293 --> 01:45:26,354
fat, self-indulgent little blobs,
I doubt that it will do any harm.

1740
01:45:26,431 --> 01:45:29,889
By the way, darling, here are
the sleeping pills and the vitamins...

1741
01:45:29,968 --> 01:45:31,595
both plainly marked.

1742
01:45:33,438 --> 01:45:36,407
Thank you, Monica.
I'll keep them separate.

1743
01:45:36,741 --> 01:45:38,902
Emory and Reggie
just got back from fishing.

1744
01:45:38,977 --> 01:45:41,878
Reggie's having dinner with us
before he leaves tonight.

1745
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:45,108
Wouldn't you like to eat with us,
you and Rhoda, too?

1746
01:45:45,183 --> 01:45:46,582
No, Monica.

1747
01:45:47,151 --> 01:45:49,711
Thank you very much.
Really, I'd rather not.

1748
01:45:50,755 --> 01:45:55,249
You poor girl.
I do bully you, and I promised not to.

1749
01:45:59,230 --> 01:46:00,561
What was that?

1750
01:46:01,099 --> 01:46:04,762
It sounded like somebody
shouting for help. It sounded close by.

1751
01:46:09,574 --> 01:46:11,701
Rhoda, who was that shouting?

1752
01:46:11,910 --> 01:46:13,138
I don't know, Mother.

1753
01:46:13,211 --> 01:46:16,578
- It sounded as if there were a fire.
- No, I don't think so.

1754
01:46:29,627 --> 01:46:31,492
- No, Reg! Back here!
- Look!

1755
01:46:43,241 --> 01:46:44,708
Give me that shovel.

1756
01:46:54,352 --> 01:46:55,580
Get the hose!

1757
01:46:56,754 --> 01:46:59,314
Help me!

1758
01:47:12,136 --> 01:47:13,899
It's too late.

1759
01:47:14,305 --> 01:47:17,468
- Somebody call an ambulance!
- He's lying still.

1760
01:47:17,542 --> 01:47:19,772
Whatever can be done will be done.

1761
01:47:19,844 --> 01:47:22,574
Yes, Monica. But now, you see...

1762
01:47:24,015 --> 01:47:26,950
I should have known
that this was going to happen.

1763
01:47:27,018 --> 01:47:30,146
I should have known it.
How could I be so blind?

1764
01:47:30,221 --> 01:47:32,655
Thank God Rhoda was in the den
playing the piano.

1765
01:47:32,724 --> 01:47:34,419
The fire was where LeRoy was!

1766
01:47:34,492 --> 01:47:38,451
- There was nothing you could do.
- This time I saw it with my own eyes.

1767
01:47:39,530 --> 01:47:42,294
Make them stop screaming
because it isn't going to help.

1768
01:47:42,367 --> 01:47:45,359
Make her stop that music, Monica.

1769
01:47:45,436 --> 01:47:47,996
Because that man is still screaming...

1770
01:47:48,072 --> 01:47:52,270
and the piano is going on and on
while he's dying in the fire screaming.

1771
01:47:52,343 --> 01:47:53,776
A man screaming!

1772
01:47:53,845 --> 01:47:56,245
- Monica!
- I don't want to see anybody now.

1773
01:47:56,314 --> 01:47:57,941
It's Emory, dear.

1774
01:47:59,183 --> 01:48:00,912
There was a flare-up in the basement.

1775
01:48:00,985 --> 01:48:04,921
Tasker and the rest are putting it out now.
I'm afraid poor LeRoy...

1776
01:48:04,989 --> 01:48:07,822
- Never mind.
- I saw him.

1777
01:48:08,593 --> 01:48:11,494
I saw him run down the path and die.

1778
01:48:11,562 --> 01:48:14,963
Can it be any worse than that?

1779
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:19,433
Seems he fell asleep
on a bed he'd made out of excelsior.

1780
01:48:19,504 --> 01:48:22,166
I suppose a cigarette set fire to the stuff.

1781
01:48:23,374 --> 01:48:26,241
My God, Monica.

1782
01:48:26,711 --> 01:48:30,374
Monica, I just simply cannot bear it!
Now she is driving me mad!

1783
01:48:30,448 --> 01:48:33,542
How could she play that now?
Rhoda, I want you to...

1784
01:48:33,618 --> 01:48:35,984
- What is it?
- Monica, I can't stand it!

1785
01:48:36,054 --> 01:48:38,454
How can she play that music now?

1786
01:48:39,557 --> 01:48:43,653
Rhoda, stop playing that music!

1787
01:48:45,163 --> 01:48:47,654
Stop that music!

1788
01:48:48,499 --> 01:48:51,400
Let me get my hands on her!
You didn't see it, did you?

1789
01:48:51,469 --> 01:48:55,337
You could turn away,
and you could play the piano.

1790
01:48:55,406 --> 01:48:57,738
What has she done?

1791
01:49:01,879 --> 01:49:03,608
It isn't what she's done.

1792
01:49:05,283 --> 01:49:08,309
- It's what I've done.
- What does she mean, Monica?

1793
01:49:08,419 --> 01:49:11,183
I don't know, Rhoda.
She'd better go upstairs with me.

1794
01:49:11,255 --> 01:49:14,850
- She'll stay till you're calmer.
- Yes, Monica. Would you take her, please?

1795
01:49:14,926 --> 01:49:18,123
- But will you be all right, dear?
- I'll be all right!

1796
01:49:18,429 --> 01:49:21,956
It just that that screaming got louder!

1797
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:25,198
We'll come down for you later.
Come, Rhoda.

1798
01:49:27,872 --> 01:49:29,499
She killed him...

1799
01:49:30,241 --> 01:49:32,471
but she's my little girl...

1800
01:49:33,044 --> 01:49:34,568
and I love her.

1801
01:49:36,147 --> 01:49:37,409
My baby.

1802
01:49:46,891 --> 01:49:51,055
"Polly put one toe out from under
the covers to find out how cold it was...

1803
01:49:51,562 --> 01:49:53,587
"and it was nipping cold.

1804
01:49:53,965 --> 01:49:57,093
"She remembered why she'd wanted
to wake up and got out of bed...

1805
01:49:57,168 --> 01:49:59,102
"very softly...

1806
01:49:59,170 --> 01:50:02,139
"shivering and pulling on her dress
and her stockings.

1807
01:50:02,206 --> 01:50:04,970
"She'd never seen a Christmas tree
decorated and lighted...

1808
01:50:05,042 --> 01:50:09,172
"the way they are at Christmas
and houses where children have...

1809
01:50:11,215 --> 01:50:15,379
"fathers, and it isn't hard times.

1810
01:50:15,987 --> 01:50:18,922
"She'd promised herself
that she would see one."

1811
01:50:20,591 --> 01:50:22,752
You have some new vitamins
to take tonight.

1812
01:50:22,827 --> 01:50:24,124
- New ones?
- Yes.

1813
01:50:24,328 --> 01:50:26,421
- Are those the vitamins?
- Yes.

1814
01:50:26,497 --> 01:50:28,465
May I see them, please?

1815
01:50:29,167 --> 01:50:30,862
Why, yes, of course.

1816
01:50:33,337 --> 01:50:35,828
They're some that Monica sent down.

1817
01:50:38,276 --> 01:50:40,437
You know, I think Monica likes me.

1818
01:50:40,745 --> 01:50:42,337
I'm sure she does.

1819
01:50:42,513 --> 01:50:45,107
Swallowing pills is just a trick.

1820
01:50:45,783 --> 01:50:47,683
You're very good at it.

1821
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:50,912
Do you love me, Mommy?

1822
01:50:54,058 --> 01:50:55,252
Yes.

1823
01:50:56,394 --> 01:50:58,191
Do you know about LeRoy?

1824
01:50:59,096 --> 01:51:00,085
Yes.

1825
01:51:00,464 --> 01:51:03,695
You told me to put my shoes
in the incinerator, didn't you?

1826
01:51:04,202 --> 01:51:05,464
Yes.

1827
01:51:05,536 --> 01:51:07,436
What did you do with the medal?

1828
01:51:07,505 --> 01:51:09,439
I can have it now, can't I?

1829
01:51:09,807 --> 01:51:12,469
I drove out to the playground alone...

1830
01:51:12,910 --> 01:51:16,937
and I went out on the pier when
it was dark and no one could see me...

1831
01:51:17,014 --> 01:51:20,609
and I dropped the medal by the pilings
in the water there.

1832
01:51:20,685 --> 01:51:23,051
Mommy, LeRoy had my shoes.

1833
01:51:23,421 --> 01:51:25,946
He said he was
going to give them to the police...

1834
01:51:26,023 --> 01:51:27,752
and then tell them about me...

1835
01:51:27,825 --> 01:51:29,725
and they would put me
in the electric chair.

1836
01:51:29,794 --> 01:51:32,092
You don't have to say any more.

1837
01:51:33,264 --> 01:51:35,198
Will you read more now?

1838
01:51:36,167 --> 01:51:38,658
Yes, but first you have to take these.

1839
01:51:40,905 --> 01:51:44,272
- So many?
- They're a new kind. I'm to take them, too.

1840
01:51:58,456 --> 01:52:00,287
I like apricot juice.

1841
01:52:00,358 --> 01:52:02,258
It doesn't even need ice.

1842
01:52:12,136 --> 01:52:13,160
Mommy...

1843
01:52:15,039 --> 01:52:17,303
I saved a couple of matches...

1844
01:52:18,309 --> 01:52:19,776
and I lit...

1845
01:52:20,811 --> 01:52:23,211
the excelsior and locked the door.

1846
01:52:23,281 --> 01:52:27,047
But it wasn't my fault, Mommy.
It was LeRoy's fault.

1847
01:52:27,118 --> 01:52:29,780
He shouldn't have said
he'd tell the police about me...

1848
01:52:29,854 --> 01:52:32,118
- and give them my shoes.
- I know.

1849
01:52:42,767 --> 01:52:44,530
There. That's all.

1850
01:52:51,309 --> 01:52:53,334
Don't let them hurt me, Mommy.

1851
01:52:57,348 --> 01:52:59,407
I won't let them hurt you.

1852
01:53:06,590 --> 01:53:08,888
- Good night.
- Good night, Mommy.

1853
01:53:09,126 --> 01:53:10,491
Now will you read?

1854
01:53:14,765 --> 01:53:15,789
Yes.

1855
01:53:28,479 --> 01:53:30,606
"When Polly was all dressed...

1856
01:53:30,748 --> 01:53:34,309
"she found her shawl and crept quietly
out of the front door.

1857
01:53:34,819 --> 01:53:38,516
"The door creaked and she waited
and listened, but nobody woke up.

1858
01:53:38,823 --> 01:53:40,450
"She closed the door carefully...

1859
01:53:40,524 --> 01:53:43,925
"and looked at the bright moon
and the shining cold snow.

1860
01:53:43,995 --> 01:53:46,725
"The Carters must have a tree.
They lived two blocks away.

1861
01:53:46,797 --> 01:53:49,527
"If they left the curtains open,
you could look in and see.

1862
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:51,898
"If only there weren't any dogs.

1863
01:53:52,069 --> 01:53:54,731
"Polly walked carefully on the hard snow
on the walk...

1864
01:53:54,805 --> 01:53:57,569
"keeping the warm shawl
close around her.

1865
01:53:57,908 --> 01:54:00,877
"It was further than she remembered
to the Carters' house...

1866
01:54:00,945 --> 01:54:04,244
"but she could see
that there were lights in the windows.

1867
01:54:04,315 --> 01:54:07,045
"She came near it, only making a little...

1868
01:54:07,318 --> 01:54:09,513
"creaking noise on the snow...

1869
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:12,348
"and stood for a while
in front of the house...

1870
01:54:12,423 --> 01:54:14,254
"before she dared go near.

1871
01:54:22,099 --> 01:54:25,091
"Then, she gathered all her courage...

1872
01:54:25,169 --> 01:54:28,866
"and walked across the yard,
her shoes sinking through the crust.

1873
01:54:30,274 --> 01:54:33,801
"The Christmas tree
was right in the front window...

1874
01:54:34,145 --> 01:54:35,942
"and the lights were on in the house...

1875
01:54:36,013 --> 01:54:39,039
"so she could see the fruits and the bells...

1876
01:54:39,116 --> 01:54:41,516
"and the strings of popcorn and candy...

1877
01:54:43,087 --> 01:54:44,714
"and the silver star...

1878
01:54:46,157 --> 01:54:47,624
"at the top."

1879
01:55:04,675 --> 01:55:06,575
Rhoda, you're mine...

1880
01:55:07,344 --> 01:55:09,005
and I carried you...

1881
01:55:09,647 --> 01:55:11,239
and I can't let them hurt you.

1882
01:55:11,315 --> 01:55:14,307
I can't let them take you away
and shut you up.

1883
01:55:14,752 --> 01:55:17,585
They'd stare at you
and make a show of you...

1884
01:55:18,022 --> 01:55:21,423
and nobody can save you from that
unless I save you.

1885
01:55:23,561 --> 01:55:25,392
So sleep well...

1886
01:55:26,330 --> 01:55:30,323
and dream well, my only child,
and the one I love.

1887
01:55:32,470 --> 01:55:34,461
I shall sleep, too.

1888
01:56:46,577 --> 01:56:47,737
Yes, Doctor.

1889
01:56:50,281 --> 01:56:51,407
Has she...

1890
01:56:51,982 --> 01:56:55,110
- Has anything changed?
- Her condition is still the same.

1891
01:56:55,186 --> 01:56:56,175
Can't l...

1892
01:56:56,253 --> 01:57:00,121
Please, Colonel, everything possible
is being done for Mrs. Penmark.

1893
01:57:00,191 --> 01:57:01,818
But it's been two days.

1894
01:57:02,126 --> 01:57:05,095
You mustn't go in there.
The doctor will be out soon.

1895
01:57:18,042 --> 01:57:19,703
Why did she do it?

1896
01:57:20,177 --> 01:57:21,201
Again?

1897
01:57:21,278 --> 01:57:23,439
That's what I can't understand.

1898
01:57:24,481 --> 01:57:26,642
Why did she do such a thing?

1899
01:57:27,952 --> 01:57:29,943
She wasn't unhappy when I left.

1900
01:57:30,788 --> 01:57:34,246
Maybe a little bit down
about us being separated for a while...

1901
01:57:34,792 --> 01:57:36,726
because we were in love.

1902
01:57:37,094 --> 01:57:39,722
Don't you see? She proved that to me.

1903
01:57:40,297 --> 01:57:42,197
Christine and I were in love.

1904
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:45,091
Suddenly, she doesn't want
to live anymore.

1905
01:57:45,436 --> 01:57:48,166
She seemed a bit upset
over the accident to the Daigle boy.

1906
01:57:48,239 --> 01:57:50,537
Yes, but she met that perfectly well.

1907
01:57:50,741 --> 01:57:54,541
No, a thing like that wouldn't
unbalance her to the point of...

1908
01:57:56,847 --> 01:58:00,408
Dick, you must have had a good
heart-to-heart get-together...

1909
01:58:00,484 --> 01:58:02,418
when you were down for your visit.

1910
01:58:02,486 --> 01:58:04,954
Did she say anything? Mention anything?

1911
01:58:05,623 --> 01:58:07,386
You've got to be frank with me.

1912
01:58:07,458 --> 01:58:10,325
Ken, there's nothing I can say
that will help at all.

1913
01:58:10,394 --> 01:58:14,330
Monica, you know she was quite
hysterical at the death of LeRoy.

1914
01:58:14,965 --> 01:58:17,263
And it was that same night it happened?

1915
01:58:17,334 --> 01:58:20,360
Yes. We heard the shot and ran down.

1916
01:58:20,871 --> 01:58:25,035
She had done it after giving Rhoda
that lethal dose of sleeping pills.

1917
01:58:26,510 --> 01:58:28,239
Why, I don't know...

1918
01:58:29,179 --> 01:58:33,013
but she'd obviously planned
that they should go together.

1919
01:58:35,919 --> 01:58:37,511
If she doesn't live...

1920
01:58:40,324 --> 01:58:41,814
I don't think I can.

1921
01:58:42,226 --> 01:58:44,888
Kenneth, my dear,
you mustn't talk like that.

1922
01:58:46,664 --> 01:58:48,655
Even if the worst does happen...

1923
01:58:49,833 --> 01:58:52,358
you still have something to be grateful for.

1924
01:58:53,737 --> 01:58:56,604
You still have Rhoda.

1925
01:58:58,709 --> 01:59:01,940
If we hadn't heard the shot
and gotten the doctor quickly...

1926
01:59:02,012 --> 01:59:03,673
Rhoda would be gone.

1927
01:59:13,824 --> 01:59:15,257
There she is.

1928
01:59:17,928 --> 01:59:19,725
Is Mommy better yet, Daddy?

1929
01:59:21,031 --> 01:59:23,898
We're waiting, darling.
Come here, sweetheart.

1930
01:59:28,372 --> 01:59:30,067
The same lovely smile.

1931
01:59:31,175 --> 01:59:32,904
She'll always live in you.

1932
01:59:33,077 --> 01:59:34,977
I love you, Daddy.

1933
01:59:41,251 --> 01:59:43,913
Sorry, Colonel, there's nothing
really definite to report.

1934
01:59:43,987 --> 01:59:45,614
She's still in coma.

1935
01:59:45,689 --> 01:59:48,351
I have been successful
with this type of operation...

1936
01:59:48,425 --> 01:59:50,416
but it can go either way.

1937
01:59:50,761 --> 01:59:54,993
The brain, I feel, definitely is not damaged.
It's mainly shock and loss of...

1938
01:59:55,065 --> 01:59:56,555
But we've been all over that.

1939
01:59:56,633 --> 01:59:59,397
I really think the best thing you can do
is to go home.

1940
01:59:59,470 --> 02:00:02,439
A certain young lady here
looks rather tired.

1941
02:00:02,673 --> 02:00:04,834
She's had quite an ordeal herself,
you know.

1942
02:00:04,908 --> 02:00:08,469
I really think it would be best.
I won't leave Mrs. Penmark...

1943
02:00:08,979 --> 02:00:10,241
until we know.

1944
02:00:10,781 --> 02:00:11,975
Very well.

1945
02:00:12,883 --> 02:00:14,612
Let's go home now, Rhoda.

1946
02:00:30,033 --> 02:00:33,059
I forgot my lighter. Be right back.

1947
02:00:36,673 --> 02:00:39,437
- Give me a few seconds, Doctor?
- Certainly.

1948
02:00:39,777 --> 02:00:41,335
- Smoke?
- Thanks.

1949
02:00:43,881 --> 02:00:46,748
I meant to ask you,
during my daughter's...

1950
02:00:46,817 --> 02:00:49,115
While she's been unconscious,
did she say anything?

1951
02:00:49,186 --> 02:00:50,813
Mutter anything at all?

1952
02:00:51,488 --> 02:00:53,353
Yes, come to think of it, she did.

1953
02:00:53,424 --> 02:00:56,325
For a while there,
she kept muttering something about...

1954
02:00:56,393 --> 02:00:59,521
Yes. "A bad seed."

1955
02:01:00,330 --> 02:01:02,161
Does that give you any clue?

1956
02:01:02,633 --> 02:01:04,123
Not particularly.

1957
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:08,226
Yes, she was starting to write a book,
something around the theory...

1958
02:01:08,305 --> 02:01:12,571
let me see, that a child can inherit
criminal tendencies in the blood.

1959
02:01:12,709 --> 02:01:15,177
If you'll forgive me,
that's a pretty specious theory.

1960
02:01:15,245 --> 02:01:18,305
That's what I told her.
It's a matter of environment, isn't it?

1961
02:01:18,382 --> 02:01:21,283
Of course. Now and then,
we get a twisted brain chemistry...

1962
02:01:21,351 --> 02:01:24,946
born to healthy, enlightened parents,
but that's one in a million.

1963
02:01:25,022 --> 02:01:28,048
- I was sure of that.
- Great Scott, if we were foolish enough...

1964
02:01:28,125 --> 02:01:29,854
to swallow that other venal belief...

1965
02:01:29,927 --> 02:01:34,023
nobody would ever either adopt a child
or even have children of their own...

1966
02:01:34,331 --> 02:01:37,129
like that sweet little girl
she has, for example.

1967
02:01:38,101 --> 02:01:39,295
Thanks.

1968
02:01:40,170 --> 02:01:43,264
- Thank you very much, Doctor. Good night.
- Good night.

1969
02:01:45,342 --> 02:01:46,468
There, now.

1970
02:01:48,178 --> 02:01:50,738
Daddy, will Mommy get well?

1971
02:01:52,583 --> 02:01:55,143
- We just prayed for her, didn't we?
- Yes.

1972
02:01:55,986 --> 02:01:58,819
What made me sick
the night Mommy hurt herself?

1973
02:02:00,023 --> 02:02:02,389
Everybody gets tummy trouble
now and then.

1974
02:02:02,459 --> 02:02:04,723
All ready to turn out the lights now?

1975
02:02:04,795 --> 02:02:07,389
What would you give me
for a basket of kisses?

1976
02:02:07,464 --> 02:02:09,193
A basket of kisses?

1977
02:02:09,433 --> 02:02:11,765
I'll give you a basket of hugs.

1978
02:02:14,671 --> 02:02:17,231
- Good night, my sweetheart.
- Good night, Daddy.

1979
02:02:22,513 --> 02:02:25,277
Daddy. Aunt Monica likes me.

1980
02:02:25,516 --> 02:02:27,177
Everybody loves you.

1981
02:02:27,251 --> 02:02:29,811
She said if she ever died or anything,
or went away...

1982
02:02:29,887 --> 02:02:32,014
she'd give me Sweetsie, her lovebird.

1983
02:02:32,089 --> 02:02:33,750
That's nice, honey...

1984
02:02:33,824 --> 02:02:37,351
but Aunt Monica isn't going to die
or go away for a long time.

1985
02:02:38,462 --> 02:02:42,091
- A long time?
- That's right. Go to sleep now.

1986
02:02:42,799 --> 02:02:45,996
Daddy, how long do lovebirds live?

1987
02:02:46,803 --> 02:02:49,294
- I don't know.
- As long as people?

1988
02:02:49,606 --> 02:02:51,301
No, not that long.

1989
02:02:51,375 --> 02:02:54,344
I'll find out for sure tomorrow
when Aunt Monica takes me...

1990
02:02:54,411 --> 02:02:55,742
for my sunbath.

1991
02:02:55,812 --> 02:02:56,938
Where is that?

1992
02:02:57,014 --> 02:02:59,710
Aunt Monica promised me
she'd take me for a sunbath.

1993
02:02:59,783 --> 02:03:03,617
She fixed up a place on the roof.
Way up high where no one can see us.

1994
02:03:03,687 --> 02:03:05,712
- Isn't that nice?
- That's wonderful.

1995
02:03:05,789 --> 02:03:08,257
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Daddy.

1996
02:05:18,488 --> 02:05:19,512
Yes?

1997
02:05:19,623 --> 02:05:20,817
Col. Penmark?

1998
02:05:20,891 --> 02:05:22,518
- Yes, Doctor.
- I have somebody here...

1999
02:05:22,592 --> 02:05:26,028
who wishes to talk with you.
We can't handle her unless she does.

2000
02:05:26,096 --> 02:05:29,588
But don't talk but very little, Colonel.
On your honor, now.

2001
02:05:36,707 --> 02:05:37,935
Kenneth.

2002
02:05:39,743 --> 02:05:41,210
Kenneth, darling.

2003
02:05:43,513 --> 02:05:45,879
They said I'm going to be all right.

2004
02:05:46,983 --> 02:05:50,612
Christine, dearest, just to hear you,
but don't talk anymore.

2005
02:05:52,923 --> 02:05:54,049
Kenneth...

2006
02:05:54,891 --> 02:05:56,324
I've committed...

2007
02:05:57,661 --> 02:05:59,094
a dreadful sin.

2008
02:06:00,630 --> 02:06:03,394
And I know that I'm going to have...

2009
02:06:03,467 --> 02:06:05,799
to pay for it in some way.

2010
02:06:08,371 --> 02:06:09,668
Just to know...

2011
02:06:10,974 --> 02:06:12,965
that I have your forgiveness...

2012
02:06:14,144 --> 02:06:16,476
Sweetheart, please don't talk anymore.

2013
02:06:17,180 --> 02:06:20,980
Whatever it is, not now.
We'll solve it together.

2014
02:06:24,588 --> 02:06:25,680
Oh, Kenneth.

2015
02:06:27,591 --> 02:06:28,853
I love you.

2016
02:06:32,596 --> 02:06:33,756
I love you.

2017
02:07:34,391 --> 02:07:36,018
One moment, please.

2018
02:07:36,726 --> 02:07:39,559
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
