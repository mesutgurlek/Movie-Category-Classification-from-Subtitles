1
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:39,300
Grandmother.

2
00:01:43,316 --> 00:01:44,476
Come closer.

3
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:04,070
Take this
to your village...

4
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:06,231
and tell the people...

5
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:10,004
the day of their deliverance
is at hand.

6
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:36,466
Make way for
Prince Prospero!

7
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,810
Get back there!

8
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:09,394
According to my custom...

9
00:03:09,436 --> 00:03:11,233
I have come here
personally...

10
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:14,206
to thank you for
the year's harvest...

11
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:16,732
To make sure we'll starve
on what is left.

12
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,900
And to invite you
to a feast...

13
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:20,435
to be held
in a fortnight...

14
00:03:21,114 --> 00:03:22,741
when annually
I gather about me...

15
00:03:22,782 --> 00:03:24,409
the nobles of
the countryside.

16
00:03:24,451 --> 00:03:26,248
When you'll throw us
the scraps from your table...

17
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:27,412
as if we were dogs.

18
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:28,614
Exactly.

19
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:31,420
But these dogs
have a loud bark...

20
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,925
and show their teeth.

21
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,119
Why?

22
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:37,452
An old woman met
a holy man on the hill.

23
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:38,794
He made a prophecy.

24
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:42,299
He said the day of our
deliverance was at hand.

25
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:44,467
From your tyranny.

26
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:49,965
Well, then, shouldn't you be
on your knees to give thanks?

27
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,310
Garotte them.

28
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:04,556
No! I beg of you.

29
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:06,991
Mercy! Mercy!
Mercy in the name of...

30
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:11,253
The girl was addressing me.

31
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:13,258
What is your name?

32
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:16,495
Francesca.

33
00:04:16,536 --> 00:04:18,504
What do you want
of me, Francesca?

34
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:20,466
Forgive them!

35
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:21,633
Forgive them!

36
00:04:21,675 --> 00:04:24,041
That is not possible.

37
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:25,442
They have defied me.

38
00:04:26,112 --> 00:04:28,080
If my hound
bites my hand...

39
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:30,582
after I have fed
and caressed him...

40
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:32,608
should I allow him
to go undisciplined?

41
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:34,919
Forgive them.
I beg of you.

42
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,348
How innocent you are.

43
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:44,621
However, I am disposed
to temper justice with mercy.

44
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:47,956
So I will leave it
up to you, Francesca.

45
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:55,801
One must die.

46
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:58,137
Which one?

47
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:06,582
One is my father.

48
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:11,417
The other,
the man I love.

49
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:17,157
You promised me
entertainment...

50
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:19,588
but I never
hoped for this.

51
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,997
Can such eyes ever
have known sin?

52
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:26,398
They will, Alfredo.

53
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,599
They will.

54
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:30,936
However, this is not
for your entertainment.

55
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:33,738
Even so, Francesca,
you must choose.

56
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,578
One will live,
one will die,

57
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:38,607
or both will die.

58
00:05:40,453 --> 00:05:41,613
Silence that.

59
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,416
Well, choose, Francesca.

60
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,618
Which will die?

61
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:48,453
Choose.

62
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,591
Must I take care
of everything myself?

63
00:05:58,805 --> 00:05:59,931
Well, what is it?

64
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:01,565
Look, sir. Look.

65
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:18,417
The Red Death.

66
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:28,560
That old woman
was told the prophecy?

67
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:30,262
- Yes.
- Did you touch her?

68
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:33,265
- No.
- Or you or you?

69
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:37,236
Take them
to the castle.

70
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:38,471
- I'll take the girl.
- No!

71
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:39,637
They may provide us...

72
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:41,078
with some
entertainment after all.

73
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:42,945
To your horses, friends.

74
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:48,114
Burn the village
to the ground.

75
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:50,751
Why do you burn
their homes?

76
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,257
Winter comes.

77
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,260
This is your day
of deliverance...

78
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:55,454
remember?

79
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:06,368
Come on, there.
Come on, hurry up.

80
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:07,873
Come on, quick.

81
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:09,067
Come on.
Over there.

82
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:11,143
Come on, then.
Come on.

83
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:13,609
Get moving, there.
Quickly, get along.

84
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:24,045
Come on.

85
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:25,918
Hurry up!

86
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:13,865
Couriers,

87
00:08:13,907 --> 00:08:15,704
you are to go to
my intended guests...

88
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:19,200
to the Duke of Verga,
to Verona, Florence...

89
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:20,371
tell them that they
are to come here...

90
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:22,074
to my castle
without delay...

91
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,081
And if they wish
admittance...

92
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:27,553
to avoid the village
of Catania...

93
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:28,747
but to come at once.

94
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:33,217
You will wash.

95
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:34,385
In my own time.

96
00:08:34,427 --> 00:08:35,553
The prince says
now is the time.

97
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:38,257
I will do nothing until I know
about Gino and my father.

98
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:49,537
Modesty,
but no humility.

99
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:52,204
Gino and my father,
where are they?

100
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:53,872
Why do you
hide yourself?

101
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:57,446
It's not right that
you should look at me.

102
00:08:59,252 --> 00:09:00,412
You may go.

103
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:07,382
That cross you wear
around your neck...

104
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:09,718
is it only a decoration...

105
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:13,229
or are you a true
Christian believer?

106
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,398
Yes, I believe.

107
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:17,434
Truly.

108
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,700
Then I want you
to remove it at once...

109
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:21,900
and never to wear it
within this castle again.

110
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:38,049
This peasant girl,

111
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:39,388
is she always to be
bathed in my bedroom?

112
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:41,723
We'll find you
another room, Juliana.

113
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:44,059
Meanwhile, you will dress
the Lady Francesca

114
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:45,223
in one of your
finest gowns.

115
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:46,391
I don't...

116
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:47,558
Later,
you can instruct her...

117
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,965
in the ways
of the court.

118
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:50,765
Please, my father...

119
00:09:51,604 --> 00:09:53,765
Oh, yes. Your father.

120
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:57,076
Your father
and your lover...

121
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,577
are being quartered...

122
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:01,345
in a warm
and safe place.

123
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:04,776
Now I must
join my guests.

124
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:16,587
You may think that...

125
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:18,460
you've impressed
the Prince Prospero,

126
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:21,358
but you can count on
little help from me.

127
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:23,967
You will do
as he told you.

128
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:27,538
Yes, as we all must do.

129
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:32,308
I will do what I must
to save my men.

130
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:36,304
But if they are killed...

131
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:41,886
I will die and so
will Prince Prospero.

132
00:10:48,995 --> 00:10:52,954
Let me speak to you about
the anatomy of terror.

133
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:54,159
Terror?

134
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:58,497
What would you know
of terror, Alfredo?

135
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:01,936
Your senses
are much too blunt.

136
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:04,439
What is terror?

137
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:06,938
Come.

138
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,109
Silence.

139
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:19,113
Listen.

140
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:26,455
Is it to awaken and hear
the passing of time...

141
00:11:30,803 --> 00:11:34,466
or is it the failing beat
of your own heart?

142
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:44,280
Or the footsteps of someone
who just a moment before...

143
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:45,978
was in your room?

144
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:50,979
But let us not
dwell on terror.

145
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:54,649
The knowledge of terror
is vouchsafed...

146
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:58,322
only to the precious few.

147
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:10,936
And now may I present
for your entertainment...

148
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:16,445
the dancers Esmeralda
and Hop Toad.

149
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:13,902
Wherever
did you find her?

150
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,908
Pretty toy, isn't she?

151
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:17,204
Delightful.

152
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:32,750
I wonder...

153
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,623
I'm sure you do,
Alfredo.

154
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:37,422
I'm sure you wonder
about every female...

155
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:39,431
in my household...

156
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:41,797
every one with the appearance
of innocence.

157
00:13:42,468 --> 00:13:43,765
You seem to take
great pleasure...

158
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:44,929
in corrupting it.

159
00:13:44,971 --> 00:13:47,098
I'm not corrupting
Alfredo, no.

160
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,300
Instructing.

161
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:17,930
If the wench were full-size,
she'd drown us all in wine.

162
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:23,102
Well, my first novelty
seems to have failed.

163
00:14:23,776 --> 00:14:25,573
However, on the Sabbath
at midnight...

164
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:26,737
for your amusement...

165
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:29,077
there will be
a masquerade.

166
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:30,582
The wardrobes
of the castle...

167
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:32,277
are yours to use.

168
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:36,410
But I beg of you,
even for the humor of it,

169
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:37,922
do not wear red.

170
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:42,625
You go too far.

171
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:45,620
I am not without
influence and power.

172
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:47,633
Against the Red Death?

173
00:14:49,468 --> 00:14:50,628
Yes.

174
00:14:51,304 --> 00:14:53,135
Yes, it came
to the village.

175
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:56,969
Even now, it lays waste
to the countryside.

176
00:14:57,977 --> 00:14:59,604
So you can count
yourselves fortunate...

177
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:01,408
that you are here
in this castle...

178
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:04,906
under the protection
of Prince Prospero.

179
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:21,597
May I present
the Lady Francesca?

180
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:25,434
Meanwhile, continue
with your merrymaking.

181
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:28,604
Act according
to your natures.

182
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:32,934
Senor Veronese...

183
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:37,075
you do little
but eat and swill...

184
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:40,085
and dream of other things.

185
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:41,950
How like a pig you are.

186
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:43,782
Be one.

187
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:09,904
You, Senor Lampredi...

188
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,241
you laugh at
this poor pig...

189
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:16,221
while you are small
and insignificant...

190
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:18,553
no more than a worm.

191
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:20,582
Can you be a worm,
Lampredi?

192
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,448
Senorita Escobar...

193
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:48,609
do you hear
how she laughs?

194
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:52,947
It is like nothing so much
as a braying jackass.

195
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:55,119
Be one.

196
00:17:07,073 --> 00:17:11,407
You, Senor Rimini,
ride that jackass to market.

197
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:13,571
Giddyap!

198
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:24,052
As for the rest of you,
use your imaginations.

199
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,752
Show me the lives
and loves of the animals.

200
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:40,397
See if we cannot
make something...

201
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:43,431
more exotic of her
that will appeal to me.

202
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,456
Francesca?

203
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:05,364
My father imprisoned
a friend of his...

204
00:18:05,398 --> 00:18:07,559
in this room for 3 years.

205
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:10,725
When he was released...

206
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,038
he could never again
bear to look at the sun...

207
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:17,542
or even a daffodil.

208
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:19,373
How cruel.

209
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:20,743
Cruel?

210
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,877
It was simply a test...

211
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:24,883
to prove how easily
a man's mind...

212
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:26,714
can be controlled
and twisted.

213
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:29,451
My family have always
been interested...

214
00:18:29,488 --> 00:18:30,716
in such things.

215
00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:31,882
Somewhere in
the human mind...

216
00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:33,050
my dear Francesca...

217
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:35,083
is the key
to our existence.

218
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:38,423
My ancestors
tried to find it...

219
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:41,730
to open the door
that separates us...

220
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:44,600
from our creator.

221
00:18:48,941 --> 00:18:51,409
You need no doors
to find God.

222
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:52,570
If you believe...

223
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:53,771
Believe?

224
00:18:54,947 --> 00:18:56,915
If you believe,
my dear Francesca,

225
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:59,611
you are gullible.

226
00:19:00,786 --> 00:19:02,686
Can you look
around this world...

227
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:05,713
and believe in the goodness
of a god who rules it?

228
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:10,522
Famine, pestilence,
war, disease, and death...

229
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:12,531
they rule this world.

230
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:14,726
There is also love
and life and hope.

231
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:17,258
Very little hope,
I assure you.

232
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:19,397
No.

233
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:23,731
If a god of love and light
ever did exist...

234
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,571
he is long since dead.

235
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,911
Someone...

236
00:19:29,915 --> 00:19:32,042
something...

237
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:33,745
rules in his place.

238
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:45,757
No.

239
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:50,432
No, that room
is not open to you.

240
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:53,598
Not yet.

241
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:55,433
What's in there?

242
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,270
You look as though...

243
00:20:01,113 --> 00:20:03,445
Is there something
to fear in that room?

244
00:20:04,783 --> 00:20:07,445
For the uninvited,
there is much to fear.

245
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:11,279
This has been
a trying day for you.

246
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,289
You must sleep.

247
00:20:15,794 --> 00:20:17,625
You must sleep.

248
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:25,296
Tomorrow you may see
Gino and your father.

249
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,650
Prince Prospero.

250
00:20:43,322 --> 00:20:45,654
Why do you roam
the late night corridors?

251
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,491
Sleep eludes me.

252
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:52,793
You have disturbing
thoughts?

253
00:20:52,831 --> 00:20:54,162
And you, Juliana...

254
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,490
what keeps you awake?

255
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,796
I think my
thoughts dwell...

256
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:00,498
on the same subject
as you...

257
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,600
the peasant girl.

258
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:08,944
She has a perfect faith.

259
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:10,775
So do I...

260
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:14,784
in you and in
what you believe.

261
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:17,585
I've been an eager student,

262
00:21:17,623 --> 00:21:20,786
but I've held back
from the final ceremony.

263
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:25,954
And now I'm ready to join you
at the invocation.

264
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,133
How truly realistic
women are.

265
00:21:31,971 --> 00:21:33,438
Finally you
are ready to dare...

266
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:36,930
the most terrible
rites and incantations...

267
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:39,467
to secure your
position here.

268
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:42,477
I wonder...

269
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:46,110
I wonder if she
is ready to dare...

270
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:52,317
as much or anything
for the sake of love.

271
00:27:38,437 --> 00:27:40,428
Did I startle you,
my dear?

272
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:51,108
Watch.

273
00:28:24,082 --> 00:28:26,243
Do you know how a falcon
is trained, my dear?

274
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:29,883
Her eyes are sewn shut.

275
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:31,218
Blinded temporarily,

276
00:28:31,256 --> 00:28:35,215
she suffers the whims
of her god patiently...

277
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,727
until her will
is submerged...

278
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:38,252
and she learns to serve.

279
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:42,828
Thus your god taught
and blinded you with crosses.

280
00:28:42,868 --> 00:28:45,234
You had me take off my cross
because it offended...

281
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,601
It offended no one.

282
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:52,570
My master and his followers
look about with open eyes.

283
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:56,274
No. It simply appeared to me
to be discourteous to...

284
00:28:56,948 --> 00:29:00,111
to wear the symbol
of a deity long dead.

285
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:02,884
Your master?

286
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:05,049
Satan.

287
00:29:06,224 --> 00:29:07,885
The lord of flies.

288
00:29:08,894 --> 00:29:10,555
The fallen angel.

289
00:29:11,897 --> 00:29:13,125
The devil.

290
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:18,329
Come.

291
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:36,919
Who seeks entrance
to Prince Prospero's castle?

292
00:29:37,689 --> 00:29:39,213
Prospero's invited guests.

293
00:29:39,257 --> 00:29:40,622
Open the gate at once.

294
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:42,058
It is the prince himself...

295
00:29:42,094 --> 00:29:43,959
who speaks to you,
Scarlatti.

296
00:29:43,995 --> 00:29:46,259
You are no longer
welcome here.

297
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:49,093
Really?

298
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:51,527
I know your whims, but...

299
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,731
The village is full
of the Red Death.

300
00:29:54,606 --> 00:29:55,766
The Red Death.

301
00:29:57,275 --> 00:30:00,574
Prince Prospero,
I beg you, allow us haven.

302
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:02,079
I beg sanctuary.

303
00:30:02,114 --> 00:30:04,082
This is no church.

304
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,076
By any god...

305
00:30:06,118 --> 00:30:08,143
in all the gods of time,
I beg you.

306
00:30:15,127 --> 00:30:16,253
My wife...

307
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:17,591
you've always
thought her beautiful.

308
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:18,891
And you... you desired her.

309
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,421
I've watched
your eyes follow her.

310
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:22,933
This Scarlatti
thought of himself...

311
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:25,129
as a good man
in many things.

312
00:30:25,804 --> 00:30:29,137
And he thought of his wife
as pure and unassailable.

313
00:30:30,308 --> 00:30:33,539
I give her to you
to do with as you please.

314
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:36,445
I've already had
that doubtful pleasure.

315
00:30:40,652 --> 00:30:43,985
Prince, spare me
the Red Death.

316
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:47,815
I beg you in the name
of friendship.

317
00:30:52,164 --> 00:30:53,995
In the name of friendship!

318
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:56,493
No!

319
00:30:58,503 --> 00:30:59,993
For you, friend.

320
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:08,772
Madam...

321
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:13,083
spare yourself
the Red Death.

322
00:31:14,786 --> 00:31:16,253
Pick it up!

323
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:17,915
We've been ordered
to teach you the use of arms.

324
00:31:17,956 --> 00:31:20,186
I will not learn
to fight my friend.

325
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:23,251
Now, don't be a fool.
One of you could survive.

326
00:31:23,295 --> 00:31:24,762
If you fight well,
the living one...

327
00:31:24,796 --> 00:31:25,922
might be given
his freedom.

328
00:31:25,964 --> 00:31:27,090
To live like you?

329
00:31:27,132 --> 00:31:29,293
Like one of
Prospero's pet dogs?

330
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:32,929
Kill me and Prospero
will see you dead...

331
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:35,064
for spoiling
his entertainment.

332
00:31:36,474 --> 00:31:37,805
I won't kill you.

333
00:31:38,643 --> 00:31:40,907
I'll just cut you a bit.

334
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:31,125
Stop them!
Gino knows nothing of fighting.

335
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,360
He learns rather fast.

336
00:32:44,976 --> 00:32:46,102
It is a true fact...

337
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:47,611
that the greatest swordsman
in Italy...

338
00:32:47,646 --> 00:32:49,273
would not fear
the second greatest...

339
00:32:49,314 --> 00:32:51,111
but would fear the worst,

340
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:53,640
for that one
would be unpredictable.

341
00:32:57,989 --> 00:33:01,948
Francesca!
Are you unharmed?

342
00:33:01,993 --> 00:33:06,430
Yes, Gino. And you?

343
00:33:06,464 --> 00:33:09,092
Scratches given
to taunt me to fight...

344
00:33:10,268 --> 00:33:11,929
but I will not fight
my friend.

345
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:14,564
You may force me
to discipline you...

346
00:33:14,606 --> 00:33:15,732
in some other way.

347
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:17,708
Do what you will.

348
00:33:17,742 --> 00:33:20,074
We will not fight.

349
00:33:20,111 --> 00:33:21,237
And I don't think...

350
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,406
you'll give us up
to simple torture.

351
00:33:23,448 --> 00:33:24,745
Because if you did...

352
00:33:24,783 --> 00:33:26,774
then in a way,
you would have lost.

353
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:31,619
You surprise me.

354
00:33:32,891 --> 00:33:34,756
However,
I'm pleased to find

355
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:38,126
that you've given me
a puzzle to think about.

356
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:43,965
Somehow, you two
will challenge death together.

357
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:47,301
You may be certain
of that.

358
00:34:00,985 --> 00:34:03,044
No. This way, my dear.

359
00:34:03,088 --> 00:34:04,419
It would be better.

360
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:13,394
I understand.
Life is often ugly.

361
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:15,228
But to torture men!

362
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:17,063
Is this what
your master Satan...

363
00:34:17,102 --> 00:34:18,592
demands as worship?

364
00:34:19,938 --> 00:34:22,566
These cells are very old.

365
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:25,075
A hundred years ago,
an ancestor of mine...

366
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,271
was a Christian monk.

367
00:34:27,946 --> 00:34:31,245
He was made examiner
of an early inquisition.

368
00:34:31,282 --> 00:34:36,413
He tortured over 600 men,
women, and children...

369
00:34:36,454 --> 00:34:39,252
in order to save
their souls...

370
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:41,918
for your god of love.

371
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,451
I cannot answer.
I have no learning.

372
00:34:45,964 --> 00:34:47,761
But then is Satan
a god of hate?

373
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:51,758
Oh, no.
Of reality, of truth.

374
00:34:51,803 --> 00:34:54,271
The world lives
in pain and despair...

375
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:55,602
but is at least
kept alive...

376
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,471
by a few dedicated men.

377
00:34:58,143 --> 00:35:02,079
If we lost our power,
chaos would engulf everything.

378
00:35:02,914 --> 00:35:05,212
Sometimes that power
must be used...

379
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,911
to teach harsh lessons.

380
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:10,243
But I don't
want to learn.

381
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,387
I'm afraid.

382
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:16,861
I do not want
to hurt you, my dear.

383
00:35:16,895 --> 00:35:18,624
Can't you understand?

384
00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:20,893
I want to help
save your soul...

385
00:35:20,932 --> 00:35:22,991
so you can join me
in the glories of hell.

386
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:24,763
No! Never!

387
00:35:25,937 --> 00:35:27,928
The way is not easy,
I know...

388
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,931
but I will take you
by the hand...

389
00:35:31,943 --> 00:35:34,605
and lead you through
the cruel light...

390
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,612
into the velvet darkness.

391
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:41,078
Lord Satan...

392
00:35:42,454 --> 00:35:45,787
he who is known as
Belial by the ancients...

393
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:50,090
demon lover,
of all those...

394
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:52,460
who wish to live
in your eternal night...

395
00:35:53,798 --> 00:35:57,632
here in your hour
of deepest dark...

396
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:00,967
in your temple
and before your altar...

397
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:04,898
I twice bind myself
to thee:

398
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:10,908
As your handmaiden
and your betrothed.

399
00:36:15,753 --> 00:36:18,415
And with this symbol
of your lasting victory...

400
00:36:20,425 --> 00:36:26,261
I inscribe the final mark
and offer myself to thee.

401
00:36:39,777 --> 00:36:46,945
Oh, Lord Satan,
send me a demon...

402
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:51,286
so I may know
I'm to be your wife.

403
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:55,919
What are you
lurking about for...

404
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,757
you grinning, twisted devil?

405
00:36:57,795 --> 00:36:59,956
Not only am I afflicted
with this body...

406
00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:02,532
but with sleeplessness
as well.

407
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:05,536
Losing your sleep because
of the tiny dancer?

408
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,867
She's nothing to me.

409
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:09,032
I prefer
a full-sized woman.

410
00:37:09,073 --> 00:37:10,370
Do you, now?

411
00:37:10,408 --> 00:37:12,876
How do you set about
getting such a woman?

412
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:16,870
My Master Prospero
provides me...

413
00:37:16,915 --> 00:37:19,406
with companions
from time to time.

414
00:37:20,084 --> 00:37:21,346
A good master.

415
00:37:21,386 --> 00:37:24,219
Yes, I suppose so...

416
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:26,052
but I imagine
there are better.

417
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:29,727
You'd like to leave
Prospero's service?

418
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:32,924
I fear for the security
of his reign.

419
00:37:33,765 --> 00:37:36,097
If I could find
a strong protector...

420
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:38,932
I might dare a change.

421
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:42,239
And what special service
have you to offer...

422
00:37:42,273 --> 00:37:43,570
that might persuade
someone else...

423
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:45,576
to take you
under his protection?

424
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,907
All manner of things.

425
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:50,403
I've a crafty
and inventive mind.

426
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:53,906
Indeed?
For example?

427
00:37:53,952 --> 00:37:56,079
The masquerade.

428
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,250
I would devise something
startling, novel...

429
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:02,020
something that
would be the talk...

430
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,857
of the entire revel.

431
00:38:03,895 --> 00:38:07,695
Have you told Prospero
of this novel thing?

432
00:38:07,732 --> 00:38:11,361
I fear the Prince
is much too austere.

433
00:38:11,402 --> 00:38:12,562
Will you tell me?

434
00:38:12,604 --> 00:38:15,198
Everyone will
dress as usual.

435
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:17,207
A harlequin,
a Chinese,

436
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:19,368
a soldier,
or a princess.

437
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:22,902
They will all
either be beautiful or humorous.

438
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:27,039
But all will be
obviously human.

439
00:38:27,085 --> 00:38:28,746
I will come as a demon.

440
00:38:30,922 --> 00:38:35,586
Why not come
as a great ape?

441
00:38:41,766 --> 00:38:43,927
When the guests
are gathered...

442
00:38:44,769 --> 00:38:46,259
you would enter...

443
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:49,266
arms swinging...

444
00:38:50,108 --> 00:38:53,236
advancing toward
the screaming lady...

445
00:38:53,277 --> 00:38:57,077
with lowered head
and grinning jaw.

446
00:38:57,115 --> 00:38:59,106
It'll be more
than a costume.

447
00:39:00,284 --> 00:39:02,218
It will be
a performance...

448
00:39:03,054 --> 00:39:06,046
by the cleverest man
at the court.

449
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:11,851
Where would I get
such a disguise?

450
00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:16,526
There is one... in the room
of stuffed animals.

451
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:21,698
Another toy Prince Prospero
never bothers with anymore.

452
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:24,071
I'm sure it's forgotten.

453
00:39:25,243 --> 00:39:27,871
You really think it
would cause a sensation?

454
00:39:27,912 --> 00:39:29,243
Oh, yes.

455
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:33,073
And there is
more to the game.

456
00:40:30,308 --> 00:40:31,468
Oh, Juliana.

457
00:40:33,945 --> 00:40:36,277
Thank god.
I thought...

458
00:40:36,314 --> 00:40:37,474
Yes?

459
00:40:38,149 --> 00:40:39,639
I don't know.

460
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:42,479
What's that?

461
00:40:43,988 --> 00:40:45,250
Satan's mark.

462
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:48,118
Prospero did that to you?

463
00:40:48,826 --> 00:40:49,986
No.

464
00:40:50,828 --> 00:40:52,489
I did it to myself.

465
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:57,665
It marks me as one
of Satan's handmaidens.

466
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:00,997
Are you ill?

467
00:41:01,606 --> 00:41:02,766
No.

468
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:06,940
It was a difficult ceremony.

469
00:41:09,947 --> 00:41:12,939
Veils of ignorance
were lifted from my eyes.

470
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:18,620
And now there's only
1 more rite to perform...

471
00:41:19,957 --> 00:41:21,948
and I will be
wed to Satan.

472
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:25,254
You've given away your soul.

473
00:41:25,296 --> 00:41:27,287
Yes. Gladly.

474
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:31,628
Soon all the innocence
will be gone...

475
00:41:34,972 --> 00:41:37,304
and then I will
have immortality...

476
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,141
and I shall have Prospero.

477
00:41:44,982 --> 00:41:46,813
But I must be certain.

478
00:41:48,152 --> 00:41:49,483
And if you were gone...

479
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,613
Gladly!
If there were a way.

480
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:53,988
Would you dare to leave
the safety of this castle?

481
00:41:54,826 --> 00:41:56,987
There is no safety
for me here.

482
00:41:58,996 --> 00:42:00,554
This key will unlock the cell.

483
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:03,298
The guard on the north wall
has been bribed.

484
00:42:03,334 --> 00:42:04,892
Take your Gino
and your father and go.

485
00:42:04,936 --> 00:42:06,062
But the guards...

486
00:42:06,103 --> 00:42:07,229
The way through
to the dungeons?

487
00:42:07,271 --> 00:42:09,239
You've been to the armory
and to the dungeons.

488
00:42:09,273 --> 00:42:11,070
You must make your own way.

489
00:42:11,108 --> 00:42:13,099
Now go. Quickly.

490
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:31,281
Gino?

491
00:44:40,624 --> 00:44:41,784
Gino?

492
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,278
Gino.

493
00:45:01,278 --> 00:45:03,212
Francesca.
How did you...

494
00:45:03,247 --> 00:45:04,407
Juliana.

495
00:45:09,253 --> 00:45:10,550
Quick, we must hurry
to the battlements.

496
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:11,919
The guard there
will help us.

497
00:45:38,783 --> 00:45:40,250
I think I heard something.

498
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:42,115
Oh, sit down and play.

499
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:33,596
Guard.

500
00:46:42,613 --> 00:46:44,581
Juliana betrayed us.

501
00:46:44,615 --> 00:46:46,742
She betrayed me.

502
00:46:46,784 --> 00:46:47,910
What can you want
of two men...

503
00:46:47,952 --> 00:46:49,317
who've done you no harm?

504
00:46:49,353 --> 00:46:51,753
They killed 3 of my guards.

505
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:53,120
Three human beings.

506
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:56,824
According to your faith,
they have sinned greatly.

507
00:46:57,962 --> 00:47:00,328
And tomorrow at the feast
before the masque...

508
00:47:01,265 --> 00:47:04,325
at least 1 of them must pay
for those sins.

509
00:47:30,928 --> 00:47:32,088
Hear me.

510
00:47:34,765 --> 00:47:35,925
Hear me!

511
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:41,067
Soon you will be
costuming yourselves...

512
00:47:41,105 --> 00:47:42,572
for the masque.

513
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:45,404
A celebration,
my friends.

514
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:47,933
A celebration
of victory over death...

515
00:47:48,946 --> 00:47:50,607
of evil over good.

516
00:47:52,116 --> 00:47:54,914
Senor Scarlatti and his wife
will not be joining us.

517
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:57,113
He failed to obey my orders.

518
00:47:58,789 --> 00:48:00,586
But because of me...

519
00:48:00,624 --> 00:48:03,184
through my mediation
with my master...

520
00:48:03,227 --> 00:48:04,558
the lord of flies...

521
00:48:05,563 --> 00:48:06,723
you, all of you...

522
00:48:07,731 --> 00:48:10,700
unworthy though
you may be...

523
00:48:10,734 --> 00:48:13,396
will be safe
from the Red Death.

524
00:48:14,905 --> 00:48:16,065
We promise you.

525
00:48:17,575 --> 00:48:21,568
Unless, of course,
you incur our displeasure.

526
00:48:24,748 --> 00:48:28,240
For some of you are guilty
of acts against us.

527
00:48:29,587 --> 00:48:32,420
Acts of faith, perhaps.

528
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:35,887
And all of you,
I suspect...

529
00:48:35,926 --> 00:48:37,587
still harbor some...

530
00:48:39,096 --> 00:48:41,394
sacred thoughts.

531
00:48:41,432 --> 00:48:42,592
But no more.

532
00:48:43,934 --> 00:48:46,767
The fallen angel
will protect you.

533
00:48:49,607 --> 00:48:53,566
And now for
a small entertainment.

534
00:48:53,611 --> 00:48:54,771
Guards!

535
00:49:06,056 --> 00:49:08,217
These 2 men are
true believers.

536
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:10,356
They believe in a god...

537
00:49:10,394 --> 00:49:12,555
who preached
"love thy neighbor."

538
00:49:13,731 --> 00:49:16,029
Therefore they refuse
to fight each other...

539
00:49:16,066 --> 00:49:18,694
in order to save
one of their lives.

540
00:49:18,736 --> 00:49:20,704
However, I have
devised a plan...

541
00:49:20,738 --> 00:49:23,366
whereby each may have
the honor and glory...

542
00:49:23,407 --> 00:49:25,398
of saving
the other's life.

543
00:49:26,577 --> 00:49:28,306
There are 5 daggers here.

544
00:49:29,913 --> 00:49:32,381
One of them is impregnated
with a poison...

545
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:35,749
that kills in 5 seconds.

546
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:39,753
Each man, in turn,
will cut his forearm.

547
00:49:51,101 --> 00:49:52,261
Begin.

548
00:49:55,773 --> 00:49:57,070
Would you not
lay down your life...

549
00:49:57,107 --> 00:49:58,267
for your brother?

550
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:25,127
Next.

551
00:50:47,157 --> 00:50:48,351
Five seconds.

552
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:08,942
Five seconds.

553
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,651
Five seconds.

554
00:51:58,429 --> 00:51:59,589
Father!

555
00:52:06,437 --> 00:52:08,405
The game was not
played properly...

556
00:52:08,439 --> 00:52:09,565
so both will die.

557
00:52:09,606 --> 00:52:12,234
- No.
- You're a madman.

558
00:52:12,276 --> 00:52:14,767
And yet I will live
and you will die.

559
00:52:15,946 --> 00:52:18,244
Where is your god now
in the hour of your need?

560
00:52:18,282 --> 00:52:20,944
I will see Him...
in Paradise.

561
00:52:21,819 --> 00:52:24,049
In the role of a martyr.

562
00:52:25,956 --> 00:52:29,289
No. I will not
have you killed.

563
00:52:31,295 --> 00:52:33,627
I will set you free instead.

564
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:36,766
Free to go back
to your village...

565
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,267
and the Red Death.

566
00:52:38,302 --> 00:52:39,462
I beg you.

567
00:52:39,503 --> 00:52:42,768
I am only giving him
a further glorious chance...

568
00:52:42,806 --> 00:52:44,933
to test his faith, my dear.

569
00:52:47,144 --> 00:52:48,270
Out.

570
00:52:48,312 --> 00:52:50,109
I'll come back for you,
Francesca.

571
00:52:50,147 --> 00:52:51,307
Somehow, I'll come back.

572
00:52:56,987 --> 00:53:00,445
Prince Prospero,
let me go with him.

573
00:53:00,491 --> 00:53:01,890
- You?
- Please.

574
00:53:01,925 --> 00:53:03,085
You?

575
00:53:03,927 --> 00:53:05,554
Oh, no, my dear.

576
00:53:05,596 --> 00:53:07,757
I could not bear
to think of...

577
00:53:10,267 --> 00:53:11,427
No.

578
00:53:12,269 --> 00:53:13,395
You will go
to your rooms now...

579
00:53:13,437 --> 00:53:15,268
and prepare
for the masque.

580
00:53:16,273 --> 00:53:20,607
You will not appear
in your costumes until midnight.

581
00:53:30,454 --> 00:53:31,614
Why do you follow me?

582
00:53:33,457 --> 00:53:35,288
Bring Gino back, and...

583
00:53:36,793 --> 00:53:39,591
I will do
whatever you wish.

584
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,359
You would destroy yourself
for him?

585
00:53:42,633 --> 00:53:43,930
Yes.

586
00:53:43,967 --> 00:53:46,333
You almost
cause me to doubt.

587
00:53:47,137 --> 00:53:48,297
Prospero.

588
00:53:50,641 --> 00:53:51,801
My prince.

589
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:54,970
I'm ready.

590
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:09,820
My son.

591
00:55:13,999 --> 00:55:15,296
Tell me of it.

592
00:55:15,334 --> 00:55:16,494
My god.

593
00:55:17,669 --> 00:55:18,829
My god.

594
00:55:19,671 --> 00:55:22,003
Who is your god?

595
00:55:24,009 --> 00:55:25,636
The true one.

596
00:55:25,677 --> 00:55:26,837
Yes.

597
00:55:29,181 --> 00:55:30,341
Tell me.

598
00:55:33,685 --> 00:55:34,845
I have sinned.

599
00:55:37,189 --> 00:55:38,349
I have killed.

600
00:55:40,359 --> 00:55:42,224
- For yourself?
- No.

601
00:55:46,531 --> 00:55:47,998
Now I'm afraid.

602
00:55:48,033 --> 00:55:49,864
- For yourself?
- For Francesca.

603
00:55:51,536 --> 00:55:52,696
And for me.

604
00:55:53,538 --> 00:55:56,837
I must go back for her,
but I don't know how.

605
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:58,638
What weapon can I use
against Prospero?

606
00:56:00,812 --> 00:56:01,938
Love.

607
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,277
In the air,
through the trees...

608
00:56:03,315 --> 00:56:05,783
I found myself
loving only myself.

609
00:56:05,817 --> 00:56:08,615
I'm afraid of the town
where the Red Death walks.

610
00:56:08,654 --> 00:56:11,020
I'm afraid of Prospero
in his castle.

611
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:13,150
I'm afraid.

612
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:15,319
I'm afraid.

613
00:56:17,496 --> 00:56:21,159
I give you a sign.

614
00:56:29,007 --> 00:56:30,167
What does it mean?

615
00:56:31,843 --> 00:56:33,003
Mankind.

616
00:56:41,987 --> 00:56:44,478
Won't this thing become
uncomfortably hot?

617
00:56:44,523 --> 00:56:47,492
It will become
a little warm.

618
00:56:47,526 --> 00:56:48,857
But it won't be for long.

619
00:56:50,529 --> 00:56:51,655
After the unmasking...

620
00:56:51,697 --> 00:56:53,187
you can take it off...

621
00:56:54,032 --> 00:56:56,000
because the game
will be over.

622
00:56:56,034 --> 00:56:57,501
True enough.

623
00:56:57,536 --> 00:56:58,696
Get on with it.

624
00:57:03,475 --> 00:57:04,464
Perfect.

625
00:57:05,477 --> 00:57:06,603
Perfect.

626
00:57:06,645 --> 00:57:07,805
See yourself.

627
00:57:11,983 --> 00:57:15,180
Now crouch low.

628
00:57:16,488 --> 00:57:18,183
And swing your arms.

629
00:57:24,329 --> 00:57:26,024
Back, mighty animal.

630
00:57:27,499 --> 00:57:29,467
I am your keeper...

631
00:57:29,501 --> 00:57:31,833
brought from
deepest Africa...

632
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:35,504
to control
your great strength.

633
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:36,666
Back!

634
00:57:37,642 --> 00:57:38,631
Back!

635
00:57:54,693 --> 00:57:55,819
Where do you go?

636
00:57:55,861 --> 00:57:57,658
The burial ground's
beyond the hill.

637
00:57:57,696 --> 00:57:58,993
We go to the castle.

638
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:00,499
Why?

639
00:58:00,499 --> 00:58:02,433
To beg forgiveness
of the prince.

640
00:58:02,467 --> 00:58:04,264
Forgiveness?
For what?

641
00:58:04,302 --> 00:58:06,429
For however
we have sinned.

642
00:58:06,471 --> 00:58:09,269
You'll beg forgiveness
at the house of Satan himself?

643
00:58:09,307 --> 00:58:10,774
Better than
the Red Death.

644
00:58:10,809 --> 00:58:12,140
Stop. Stop!

645
01:01:50,996 --> 01:01:52,964
My master...

646
01:01:52,998 --> 01:01:54,158
Satan.

647
01:01:58,336 --> 01:01:59,496
Prospero?

648
01:02:02,107 --> 01:02:03,267
Prospero?

649
01:02:16,621 --> 01:02:18,282
I am betrothed...

650
01:02:19,791 --> 01:02:20,951
of the devil.

651
01:02:23,461 --> 01:02:25,929
And I have seen the terrors.

652
01:02:25,964 --> 01:02:27,124
Not all of them.

653
01:02:39,477 --> 01:02:42,275
I have survived
my own sacrifice.

654
01:02:42,313 --> 01:02:43,473
There is more.

655
01:02:56,995 --> 01:02:59,122
And I am stronger
in the devil's favor...

656
01:02:59,164 --> 01:03:00,324
than you are.

657
01:03:15,947 --> 01:03:20,941
Together, on Earth,
we shall live as man and wife.

658
01:03:24,456 --> 01:03:25,616
And when he calls us...

659
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:28,956
you will be Satan...

660
01:03:30,795 --> 01:03:32,285
and I still your wife.

661
01:03:42,807 --> 01:03:45,799
I have tasted
the beauties of terror.

662
01:03:54,819 --> 01:03:55,979
Hush.

663
01:03:57,155 --> 01:03:58,782
Listen.

664
01:03:58,823 --> 01:04:00,313
The passing of time...

665
01:04:01,493 --> 01:04:03,154
the beating of a heart...

666
01:04:04,496 --> 01:04:06,828
the footstep of
an assassin.

667
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:09,493
Destiny.

668
01:04:39,864 --> 01:04:42,526
I beg you,
do not mourn for Juliana.

669
01:04:43,868 --> 01:04:45,358
We should celebrate.

670
01:04:47,205 --> 01:04:49,537
She has just married
a friend of mine.

671
01:04:51,209 --> 01:04:52,733
Let the masque begin!

672
01:05:00,218 --> 01:05:01,310
Officer of the night watch.

673
01:05:03,988 --> 01:05:05,114
Who are you?

674
01:05:05,156 --> 01:05:07,181
All that is left of
the village of Catania.

675
01:05:07,225 --> 01:05:08,453
Then go back to it.

676
01:05:08,493 --> 01:05:10,984
We beg mercy of the lord
Prince Prospero.

677
01:05:12,664 --> 01:05:14,495
Inform the prince.
It might amuse him.

678
01:05:17,502 --> 01:05:19,470
Don't grovel to him.

679
01:05:19,504 --> 01:05:20,801
Don't let him delight
in the destruction...

680
01:05:20,838 --> 01:05:22,806
of your souls.

681
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,637
I wish to save our bodies.

682
01:05:24,676 --> 01:05:25,802
The few left to us.

683
01:05:25,843 --> 01:05:28,641
Do you expect any plea
to move his heart?

684
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,171
If we must die,
let's die like human beings.

685
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:33,612
You have not seen
the Red Death.

686
01:05:35,353 --> 01:05:37,685
You've not seen
the dungeons of Prospero.

687
01:05:47,198 --> 01:05:48,358
Don't be frightened.

688
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,690
Come with me.
This is Gino.

689
01:05:52,036 --> 01:05:53,663
This is my child.

690
01:05:53,705 --> 01:05:55,536
I must give her every chance.

691
01:06:06,818 --> 01:06:08,945
Where does the rabbit run?

692
01:06:08,987 --> 01:06:11,251
That one fears Prospero
more than the Red Death.

693
01:06:16,327 --> 01:06:17,794
What do you want?

694
01:06:17,829 --> 01:06:19,456
Mercy, great prince.

695
01:06:19,497 --> 01:06:20,794
This is all that
is left of us...

696
01:06:20,832 --> 01:06:21,958
and the winter...

697
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,126
it comes on
the freezing wind.

698
01:06:23,167 --> 01:06:25,465
- There is no shelter.
- Dig a burrow...

699
01:06:25,503 --> 01:06:27,494
as the fox
and rabbits do.

700
01:06:27,538 --> 01:06:28,800
But the wells
and the streams...

701
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:29,966
they'll be frozen over.

702
01:06:30,008 --> 01:06:31,202
There's no food.

703
01:06:31,242 --> 01:06:33,836
Then store up nuts,
like the squirrels.

704
01:06:34,846 --> 01:06:35,972
Mercy.

705
01:06:36,014 --> 01:06:37,777
Give us the sanctuary
of the castle walls.

706
01:06:37,815 --> 01:06:39,476
Give me an end
to your pleading.

707
01:06:39,517 --> 01:06:41,246
Go back from
whence you came.

708
01:06:41,286 --> 01:06:42,844
We will die.

709
01:06:45,023 --> 01:06:49,824
If you refuse to go,
then... die here.

710
01:06:49,861 --> 01:06:51,658
Archers.

711
01:06:51,696 --> 01:06:52,822
But not the child.

712
01:06:52,864 --> 01:06:54,024
It will perish anyway.

713
01:06:54,065 --> 01:06:55,532
Not the child.

714
01:06:57,869 --> 01:06:59,029
Fire.

715
01:07:03,474 --> 01:07:05,101
Fire.

716
01:07:05,143 --> 01:07:06,610
Gifts!

717
01:07:06,644 --> 01:07:09,112
Gifts for everyone!

718
01:07:09,147 --> 01:07:14,779
Diamonds, rubies, emeralds,
pearls for my friends!

719
01:07:14,819 --> 01:07:16,616
For my guests!

720
01:07:16,654 --> 01:07:18,451
Look at them.

721
01:07:18,489 --> 01:07:20,616
Look at them
all scrambling...

722
01:07:20,658 --> 01:07:24,788
like starving men
for a crust of bread.

723
01:07:24,829 --> 01:07:28,663
All wealthy,
and all greedy for more.

724
01:07:29,834 --> 01:07:31,131
I give you reason...

725
01:07:31,169 --> 01:07:33,501
for real rejoicing,
my friends.

726
01:07:34,339 --> 01:07:36,637
The only survivors
of the village...

727
01:07:36,674 --> 01:07:39,802
have just come
to the castle walls.

728
01:07:39,844 --> 01:07:41,641
Only 6.

729
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:44,978
The Red Death has claimed
the rest of them.

730
01:07:45,016 --> 01:07:46,643
But as I promised you...

731
01:07:46,684 --> 01:07:52,486
all of you within these walls
under my protection are safe.

732
01:07:52,523 --> 01:07:53,854
So rejoice!

733
01:07:55,526 --> 01:07:57,494
And the 6 who lived?

734
01:07:57,528 --> 01:07:58,995
Dead.

735
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:01,123
But they demanded
to enter the castle.

736
01:08:02,467 --> 01:08:03,764
You killed them.

737
01:08:03,801 --> 01:08:05,632
It was a kindness,
my dear.

738
01:08:06,471 --> 01:08:08,268
Can't you see that?

739
01:08:08,306 --> 01:08:11,605
The Red Death brings pain
and terror and madness.

740
01:08:11,642 --> 01:08:12,802
I spared them.

741
01:08:14,145 --> 01:08:15,271
Tonight, after the masque...

742
01:08:15,313 --> 01:08:17,781
I will initiate you
into understanding.

743
01:08:18,483 --> 01:08:19,643
I don't know.

744
01:08:20,818 --> 01:08:21,978
I don't know.

745
01:09:15,473 --> 01:09:16,804
Gently, my son.

746
01:09:17,809 --> 01:09:19,606
Remain here.

747
01:09:19,644 --> 01:09:21,942
Shortly after
the stroke of 1:00...

748
01:09:21,979 --> 01:09:24,072
I will send
Francesca to you.

749
01:09:24,115 --> 01:09:26,106
I must get to her now.

750
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:28,118
You have recovered
your courage.

751
01:09:28,152 --> 01:09:29,483
Now prove your wisdom.

752
01:09:30,221 --> 01:09:31,779
There is nothing
you can do.

753
01:09:31,823 --> 01:09:33,620
There are too many.

754
01:09:33,658 --> 01:09:35,216
Wait, as I tell you.

755
01:09:35,259 --> 01:09:36,920
The guards
will discover me.

756
01:09:38,496 --> 01:09:39,656
Look there.

757
01:09:56,848 --> 01:09:58,008
Yes?

758
01:10:00,785 --> 01:10:01,911
Oh.

759
01:10:01,953 --> 01:10:03,750
Forgive me
for startling you.

760
01:10:03,788 --> 01:10:05,585
It's only Hop Toad...

761
01:10:05,623 --> 01:10:07,921
made more ugly
than even he is.

762
01:10:07,959 --> 01:10:09,449
You're not ugly to me.

763
01:10:10,294 --> 01:10:11,420
I've come to tell you...

764
01:10:11,462 --> 01:10:13,089
that there's no need
for you to appear...

765
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:14,461
at the masque tonight.

766
01:10:15,466 --> 01:10:17,263
I don't understand.

767
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:19,428
My plans are made.

768
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:21,938
If you will trust me
and believe in me...

769
01:10:21,973 --> 01:10:24,464
we'll leave this
monstrous castle tonight.

770
01:10:25,643 --> 01:10:26,940
Do we dare?

771
01:10:26,978 --> 01:10:28,138
The Red Death...

772
01:10:28,179 --> 01:10:30,943
It can be no worse
than life here.

773
01:10:30,982 --> 01:10:32,609
Believe in me.

774
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:34,140
I do believe in you.

775
01:10:35,052 --> 01:10:37,316
Have a warm cloak
and be ready.

776
01:10:38,155 --> 01:10:40,487
The game is almost over.

777
01:11:20,965 --> 01:11:22,592
Have no fear!

778
01:11:22,633 --> 01:11:24,294
I can control this monster.

779
01:11:25,636 --> 01:11:26,967
He only wants a game.

780
01:11:54,165 --> 01:11:55,826
He is too playful.

781
01:11:56,667 --> 01:11:58,999
I will tie him up
and make him helpless.

782
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:21,087
Help!

783
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:22,285
Help!

784
01:12:23,461 --> 01:12:25,952
Let me down,
you fiendish dwarf!

785
01:12:28,599 --> 01:12:30,464
Let me down!

786
01:12:30,501 --> 01:12:32,526
Better let me down.

787
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:33,696
Look, my dear,

788
01:12:33,738 --> 01:12:36,104
I believe Hop Toad
is playing...

789
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:38,267
some sort of a joke
on Alfredo.

790
01:12:38,309 --> 01:12:41,972
I will set you
to tortures unimagined!

791
01:12:42,013 --> 01:12:44,607
You have already
tortured...

792
01:12:44,649 --> 01:12:47,447
by your cruelty
to my Esmeralda.

793
01:12:47,485 --> 01:12:48,645
Hold this!

794
01:12:55,493 --> 01:13:00,157
The great African ape
says he wants some brandy.

795
01:13:11,308 --> 01:13:12,468
Let me down.

796
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:14,743
Let me down!

797
01:13:14,779 --> 01:13:16,940
Help! Help!

798
01:13:17,648 --> 01:13:19,912
Help! Let me down!

799
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:22,111
Help! Help! Let me down!

800
01:13:36,801 --> 01:13:38,268
I see you no longer
turn away...

801
01:13:38,302 --> 01:13:40,930
from the cruelties of life.

802
01:13:40,971 --> 01:13:42,461
I no longer care.

803
01:13:43,641 --> 01:13:44,801
My life is done.

804
01:13:46,143 --> 01:13:48,509
What's left
I give to you tonight.

805
01:13:57,655 --> 01:13:59,987
Guards, clear that
out of the way.

806
01:14:00,825 --> 01:14:01,951
How can my guests...

807
01:14:01,992 --> 01:14:05,450
be expected to
dance around that?

808
01:14:05,496 --> 01:14:06,793
And when you find Hop Toad...

809
01:14:06,831 --> 01:14:08,958
give him 5 pieces
of gold as a reward...

810
01:14:08,999 --> 01:14:11,126
for his entertaining jest.

811
01:14:11,168 --> 01:14:13,329
You've pleased me
very much, my dear.

812
01:14:14,839 --> 01:14:16,136
What was that?

813
01:14:16,173 --> 01:14:17,333
What is it?

814
01:14:18,676 --> 01:14:20,473
A costume
I haven't seen before.

815
01:14:20,511 --> 01:14:21,637
Someone wearing red.

816
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:23,647
And I forbade them
to wear red.

817
01:14:23,681 --> 01:14:24,841
Come.

818
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:37,487
There he is again.

819
01:14:37,528 --> 01:14:38,688
Come.

820
01:14:55,045 --> 01:14:56,205
Wait! Wait!

821
01:14:58,215 --> 01:14:59,682
Wait!

822
01:14:59,717 --> 01:15:00,979
I command you to wait!

823
01:15:02,486 --> 01:15:03,646
Prospero.

824
01:15:07,658 --> 01:15:08,818
Prospero.

825
01:15:10,494 --> 01:15:12,155
You command me to wait?

826
01:15:13,164 --> 01:15:14,324
Very well.

827
01:15:15,166 --> 01:15:16,326
I wait.

828
01:15:17,835 --> 01:15:18,995
Condotti?

829
01:15:19,837 --> 01:15:20,997
Rimini?

830
01:15:22,506 --> 01:15:24,565
Who are you
beneath your mask?

831
01:15:24,608 --> 01:15:27,805
Is my costume
such a disguise...

832
01:15:27,845 --> 01:15:29,642
that you don't
recognize me?

833
01:15:30,681 --> 01:15:32,842
Your voice is familiar.

834
01:15:34,518 --> 01:15:36,850
Dr. Bernelli,
that's who you are.

835
01:15:38,022 --> 01:15:41,253
Bernelli, you dog,
thinking to...

836
01:15:45,029 --> 01:15:46,360
You are not Bernelli.

837
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:48,495
No.

838
01:15:48,532 --> 01:15:51,023
The doctor dances
in the white room.

839
01:15:52,369 --> 01:15:55,361
But I passed close by him.

840
01:15:58,542 --> 01:16:02,911
Truly, Prospero,
you don't know me?

841
01:16:05,482 --> 01:16:06,949
So you've come.

842
01:16:06,984 --> 01:16:08,474
Yes, Prospero.

843
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:14,650
On your knees.

844
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:17,650
- Prospero!
- On your knees.

845
01:16:18,829 --> 01:16:20,990
The Prince of Darkness.

846
01:16:27,504 --> 01:16:29,699
I would like to
see your face.

847
01:16:31,008 --> 01:16:32,999
There is no face
of death...

848
01:16:34,511 --> 01:16:37,844
until the moment
of your own death.

849
01:16:39,516 --> 01:16:42,349
And I am only 1
of many messengers.

850
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:44,680
Who do you come for?

851
01:16:45,522 --> 01:16:46,648
Many.

852
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:48,317
All?

853
01:16:48,359 --> 01:16:49,519
Not all.

854
01:16:51,028 --> 01:16:52,859
I knew I was right.

855
01:16:54,031 --> 01:16:55,896
I knew it.
I've won.

856
01:16:57,701 --> 01:16:59,862
The time of unmasking.

857
01:17:01,138 --> 01:17:04,471
They begin to show
their naked faces.

858
01:17:26,664 --> 01:17:29,827
It's time for
a new dance to begin...

859
01:17:33,504 --> 01:17:35,495
The dance of death.

860
01:18:39,003 --> 01:18:41,471
Our master
will be pleased.

861
01:18:41,505 --> 01:18:43,632
I brought all of
these souls to him.

862
01:18:43,674 --> 01:18:45,801
I taught them his worship.

863
01:18:45,843 --> 01:18:47,811
I corrupted them for him.

864
01:18:47,845 --> 01:18:50,313
I knew he was supreme
when no one else did.

865
01:18:50,347 --> 01:18:53,976
I built a chapel to Satan,
and I prayed to him,

866
01:18:54,018 --> 01:18:55,986
and I made
a pact with him.

867
01:18:56,020 --> 01:18:57,988
And these,
all of my friends,

868
01:18:58,022 --> 01:19:00,320
I promised them safety.

869
01:19:00,357 --> 01:19:02,086
You presumed too much.

870
01:19:02,126 --> 01:19:03,252
I know. I know.

871
01:19:03,293 --> 01:19:05,591
But it does make
a fine jest...

872
01:19:05,629 --> 01:19:07,927
the kind of jest
that would amuse Satan.

873
01:19:07,965 --> 01:19:09,125
Would it?

874
01:19:10,634 --> 01:19:11,794
Your Excellency...

875
01:19:13,303 --> 01:19:16,431
this girl...
in all my life...

876
01:19:16,473 --> 01:19:19,306
I've never met anyone
whose faith rivaled mine.

877
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:22,278
Spare her to me.

878
01:19:22,312 --> 01:19:24,439
A charitable request?

879
01:19:24,481 --> 01:19:26,813
A rare thing with you,
Prospero.

880
01:19:28,152 --> 01:19:29,312
Go to the battlements.

881
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,651
Go now.

882
01:19:34,491 --> 01:19:35,651
Yes, Francesca.

883
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:38,958
Yes, go,
and I will join you...

884
01:19:38,996 --> 01:19:40,327
when this is over.

885
01:20:03,787 --> 01:20:06,255
Thank you,
your Excellency...

886
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:07,416
for the girl.

887
01:20:07,458 --> 01:20:08,948
I have no title.

888
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:12,121
Why do you
call me Excellency?

889
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:15,098
Well, I thought as
the ambassador of Satan...

890
01:20:15,132 --> 01:20:16,622
He is not my master.

891
01:20:17,634 --> 01:20:19,966
Death has no master.

892
01:20:21,305 --> 01:20:23,603
But Satan rules the universe.

893
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:25,107
I made a pact with him.

894
01:20:25,142 --> 01:20:27,269
He does not rule alone.

895
01:20:27,311 --> 01:20:29,973
And your pact with him
will not save you.

896
01:20:32,816 --> 01:20:34,784
There is no other god.

897
01:20:34,818 --> 01:20:35,944
Satan killed him.

898
01:20:35,986 --> 01:20:39,615
Each man creates
his own god for himself...

899
01:20:39,656 --> 01:20:42,318
his own heaven,
his own hell.

900
01:20:43,327 --> 01:20:45,386
Let me see your face.

901
01:20:47,731 --> 01:20:50,962
Your hell,
Prince Prospero...

902
01:20:51,001 --> 01:20:53,492
and the moment
of your death.

903
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:57,500
No.

904
01:20:58,675 --> 01:21:00,575
No!

905
01:21:00,611 --> 01:21:02,272
No!

906
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:42,461
Why should you
be afraid to die?

907
01:23:43,974 --> 01:23:47,137
Your soul has been dead
for a long time.

908
01:24:25,515 --> 01:24:27,312
Morning, brother.

909
01:24:27,351 --> 01:24:28,511
You've come far?

910
01:24:29,353 --> 01:24:31,480
From Cathay and beyond.

911
01:24:31,521 --> 01:24:34,979
100,000 perished
at my passing...

912
01:24:35,025 --> 01:24:36,185
this last night.

913
01:24:39,196 --> 01:24:41,528
This eternity
of wandering...

914
01:24:42,866 --> 01:24:45,357
10,000 sleep
where I walked.

915
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:47,997
I am very tired.

916
01:24:48,038 --> 01:24:49,335
The weariness of those...

917
01:24:49,373 --> 01:24:51,534
to whom we bring rest
burdens you.

918
01:24:52,876 --> 01:24:54,036
What of you, brother?

919
01:24:57,881 --> 01:24:59,212
I called many...

920
01:25:01,818 --> 01:25:04,651
peasant and prince...

921
01:25:05,655 --> 01:25:09,318
the worthy
and the dishonored.

922
01:25:11,328 --> 01:25:13,660
Six only are left...

923
01:25:14,498 --> 01:25:15,829
young man and woman...

924
01:25:17,167 --> 01:25:19,499
dwarf and tiny dancer...

925
01:25:21,671 --> 01:25:22,831
this child...

926
01:25:24,508 --> 01:25:27,170
and an old man still
in the village.

927
01:25:30,347 --> 01:25:33,180
Sic transit gloria mundi.
