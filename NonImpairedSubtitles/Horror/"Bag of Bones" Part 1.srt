Hi.
Who are you?

00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:46,176
I'm sorry,
Mr. Noonan.

Name's Brenda Meserve.

I'd be coming by today

to clean the place up for you.

it's a little late for that.

to order a villageburger.

How do you know my name?

610
00:48:56,163 --> 00:48:58,128
We don't see a celebrity
here every day.

611
00:48:58,203 --> 00:49:00,818
Yes, well, I'm hardly
what you'd call a celebrity.

612
00:49:00,869 --> 00:49:04,338
Well, we take what we can get.

613

I'm really sorry to hear about
what happened to your wife.

Hmm.

615
00:49:09,495 --> 00:49:11,962
She was a doll.

616
00:49:11,996 --> 00:49:13,514
So when she'd come in here
and eat, uh...

617
00:49:13,548 --> 00:49:15,165
Would she be alone?

618
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:17,351
Uh, I guess so.

619
00:49:17,502 --> 00:49:20,337
Or sometimes
with Bill Dean and his wife,

620
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:23,390
sometimes with Brenda Meserve,

621
00:49:23,442 --> 00:49:26,510
and maybe another friend or two.

622
00:49:26,528 --> 00:49:29,113
"Another friend or two,"
huh? Yeah.

623
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,781
Maybe. Yeah.

00:49:33,285 --> 00:49:35,202
your wife was eating with,
Mr. Noonan?

626

Mike. Mike.
Just... just call me Mike.

627
00:49:38,022 --> 00:49:42,660
I don't know, I guess
I'd just like to know

628
00:49:42,694 --> 00:49:44,962
what life was like
for a year on Dark Score.

629
00:49:45,029 --> 00:49:47,531
You know, all those years that
I couldn't make it up here.

630
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:49,834
So...
Hmm.

631
00:49:49,868 --> 00:49:51,836
Anyway.

632
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:53,537
Mattie Devore...
She's a...

633
00:49:53,555 --> 00:49:56,474
A nice enough girl,
only she can be trouble.

634
00:49:56,508 --> 00:49:58,375
That ain't fair, Buddy.

635
00:49:58,393 --> 00:50:00,427
Mattie Devore's in trouble
and with the wrong people.

636
00:50:00,479 --> 00:50:01,679
Person.

637
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,380
And who's that person?

638
00:50:03,398 --> 00:50:04,849
Max Devore.

639
00:50:04,883 --> 00:50:07,268
He's a mean old son of a buck.

640
00:50:07,352 --> 00:50:09,570
I mean, he owns that big,
uh, computer company.

641
00:50:09,604 --> 00:50:11,555
Multi-millionaire.

642
00:50:11,557 --> 00:50:14,191
Yeah, I think I, uh, may have
seen him yesterday afternoon

643
00:50:14,225 --> 00:50:16,360
in the window
of that old resort up there.

644
00:50:16,394 --> 00:50:17,995
- Mm, warrington's.
- Mm, yeah.

645
00:50:18,029 --> 00:50:21,248
Yeah, that's the fella.
Mean old cuss.

646
00:50:21,283 --> 00:50:23,417
He wants custody
of the little girl, Kyra.

647
00:50:23,451 --> 00:50:24,785
And why would he want to take
his daughter's little girl away?

648
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:26,453
- Daughter-in-law.

649
00:50:26,505 --> 00:50:28,873
Mattie married Devore's only son.

650
00:50:28,907 --> 00:50:30,925
- Devore had the boy
when he was 60-something

651
00:50:31,009 --> 00:50:32,710
with some Vegas showgirl
who's no longer

652
00:50:32,744 --> 00:50:34,094
in the picture, of course.

653
00:50:34,179 --> 00:50:37,848
- Oh, okay.
- And so about a year ago,

654
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:40,184
Lance, that's Devore's son,

655
00:50:40,218 --> 00:50:43,137
he goes a little Dark Score crazy.

656
00:50:43,221 --> 00:50:45,022
What does that mean?

657
00:50:45,056 --> 00:50:47,658
He tried to drown the little girl.

658
00:50:47,692 --> 00:50:50,361
His own flesh and blood.

659
00:50:50,395 --> 00:50:51,896
And Mattie ended up killing Lance

660
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:54,448
just to protect the little girl,
and ever since then,

661
00:50:54,482 --> 00:50:57,067
Devore's made it his mission
to take Kyra away from her.

662
00:50:57,101 --> 00:50:59,709
And what Max Devore wants,
Max Devore gets.

Mattie?

843
01:05:35,158 --> 01:05:38,577
And write.

844
01:05:38,612 --> 01:05:44,450
You have to write.

845
01:05:44,501 --> 01:05:47,503
I can't write.

846
01:05:47,537 --> 01:05:51,156
I can't write without you, Jo.

I still love my wife.

Then you should do what she says.

855
01:06:39,685 --> 01:06:41,322
Didn't she tell you to help me?

856
01:06:45,992 --> 01:06:47,319
That's not what she meant.

857

[Whispers]
You have no idea what Jo meant.

858
01:06:53,505 --> 01:06:56,507
No idea.

<i>As you know, I'm Kyra Devore's
guardian Ad Litem.</i>

You know what that means,
Mr. Noonan?

870
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:41,988
You've been appointed by
the judge to decide what's best

871
01:07:42,072 --> 01:07:43,956
for Kyra, should a custody trial
become necessary.

872
01:07:43,991 --> 01:07:46,942
Very good.

873
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,995
And the judge would not,
in such a case,

874
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:52,149
be required to base his decision
on my conclusions.

875
01:07:53,157 --> 01:07:55,279

George had trouble getting here.

Let's turn to your first meeting

880
01:08:15,742 --> 01:08:18,505
with Mattie and Kyra Devore
on the highway, shall we?

881
01:08:18,716 --> 01:08:19,405
Sure.

882
01:08:20,327 --> 01:08:22,314
Kyra Devore was all alone.

883
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,259
Her mother wasn't with her, right?

884
01:08:24,288 --> 01:08:25,866
- That's a poorly-phrased
question,

885
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:27,371
but I suppose the answer is yes.

886
01:08:28,693 --> 01:08:30,661
I'm flattered to have
my grammar corrected

887
01:08:30,685 --> 01:08:32,029
by a best-selling author.

888
01:08:33,136 --> 01:08:34,692
Is this
a better-phrased question?

889
01:08:35,382 --> 01:08:37,027
You could have run Kyra Devore over

890
01:08:37,028 --> 01:08:39,529
'cause she was playing in
the middle of the road, correct?

891
01:08:39,694 --> 01:08:41,445
The phrasing isn't better, no.

892
01:08:41,652 --> 01:08:43,199
And my answer is absolutely not.

893
01:08:43,681 --> 01:08:44,832
I was driving the speed limit.

894
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:46,625
I saw Kyra in plenty of time.

895
01:08:46,781 --> 01:08:48,147
So it's your experience
that most people obey

896
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:49,816
the speed limit
on that stretch of the road?

897
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,534
I haven't spent that much time
on Dark Score Lake.

898
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:53,086
I can't say.

899
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,988
Even in your limited experience,

900
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:58,357
do you think that most people
obey the speed limit

901
01:08:58,475 --> 01:08:59,659
on that road, Mr. Noonan?

902
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:01,994
I haven't done
a traffic survey. Sorry.

903
01:09:02,012 --> 01:09:06,232
Okay, Mr. Noonan.
Then answer me this.

904
01:09:06,234 --> 01:09:09,201
If you hadn't carried
Kyra Devore to safety,

905
01:09:09,236 --> 01:09:11,187
isn't it possible that
she could've been hit

906
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:13,506
by another car?
[Whispers] Just wait.

907
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:15,842
You know what?

908
01:09:15,893 --> 01:09:18,611
I left my crystal ball at home.

909
01:09:18,646 --> 01:09:21,497
[Chuckles] I really can't say.

910
01:09:21,499 --> 01:09:23,316
I'd like to remind you

911
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:25,368
you're under oath,
Mr. Noonan.

912
01:09:25,402 --> 01:09:27,287
I'd like to remind you that
I answered your question,

913
01:09:27,321 --> 01:09:31,023
leading as it was.

Let me ask you a question,
Mr. Durgin.

917
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,385
If you're on Kyra Devore's side,

918
01:09:42,419 --> 01:09:45,088
why does it actually seem that
you're working for Max Devore?

931

01:10:38,425 --> 01:10:41,427
Sure.

should see the light of day.

Compared to the dullest human
being walking on the earth,

the most brilliantly drawn
character in any novel

974

is nothing more than a bag of bones.

975
01:12:27,405 --> 01:12:29,222
The only problem is that
sometimes I feel like

976
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:32,526
nothing more than
a bag of bones myself.

977
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,228
A bag of bones without
the energy or the... the talent

to do what I thought I was born to do.

She was very beautiful.

At warrington's.

986
01:12:58,085 --> 01:12:59,936
I was, uh, a waitress there.

And I was working a shift
with my friend Laurie wilton,

1003
01:13:42,897 --> 01:13:44,297
No, no.
It's not your fault.

1004
01:13:44,315 --> 01:13:48,802
It's just...Messy.
Complicated.

1005
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:50,687
Plus the fact...

1006
01:13:50,772 --> 01:13:53,690
I keep thinking that Jo...

1007
01:13:53,775 --> 01:13:58,128
That she brought me here.

1008
01:13:58,179 --> 01:14:00,046
After she died, she brought you here?

1009
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,182
For a reason.

1010
01:14:02,216 --> 01:14:07,086
Like what?

1011
01:14:08,392 --> 01:14:10,997
I don't know...
Yet.

1012
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:15,151
Crazy, right?
[Laughs]

1013
01:14:15,799 --> 01:14:17,014
Not to me.

1014
01:14:17,236 --> 01:14:19,254
Yeah, well,
maybe she did bring me here

1015
01:14:19,338 --> 01:14:20,969
so she could finally tell me what...

1016
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,594
She was doing here.

1017
01:14:26,899 --> 01:14:29,231
Or maybe it's to get you
to write again.

1018
01:14:30,604 --> 01:14:31,313
Yeah.

1019
01:14:32,975 --> 01:14:34,256
Maybe you're right.

1020
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:42,998
Okay.

1021
01:14:49,186 --> 01:14:50,020

[Sighs]

1023
01:15:05,316 --> 01:15:06,164
There you are.

1024
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:07,889
Look at you.

1025
01:15:08,973 --> 01:15:10,471
Just look at you.

1026
01:15:11,272 --> 01:15:12,318
Hmm.

1027
01:15:22,154 --> 01:15:23,028
All right.

1028
01:15:24,035 --> 01:15:25,552
Let's just move that there.

1029
01:15:26,356 --> 01:15:27,780
There you go.

1030
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:30,352
There you go.

1031
01:15:32,691 --> 01:15:33,988
[Sighs]

1032
01:15:59,647 --> 01:16:01,031
"She lit a cigarette

1033
01:16:02,382 --> 01:16:04,535
"and took a long drag.

1034

1035
01:16:07,196 --> 01:16:10,844
feel like screaming."

1036
01:16:11,789 --> 01:16:14,210
It made me feel like screaming.

1037
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:17,617
It made me feel like screaming.

1038
01:16:18,347 --> 01:16:21,519
[Laughs]

1039
01:16:27,669 --> 01:16:29,068
Thank you, Jo.

1040
01:16:31,076 --> 01:16:33,303
I always said
I couldn't write without you.

1041
01:16:36,414 --> 01:16:38,014
I just had to find you.

1042
01:16:39,748 --> 01:16:41,247
I just had to find you.

Yeah.

1047

Ah.

Holy shit.

1051
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:50,692
God, I'm good.

1052
01:17:51,807 --> 01:17:53,293
Oh, yeah.

Help!
Help, I'm drown...!

Help, I'm drown...!
