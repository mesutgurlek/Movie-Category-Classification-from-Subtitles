1
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,639
Oh, Father, turn it up.

2
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,559
Please, Mr. Dragomir,
I love this song.

3
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,919
This song is sick... the traditional
"vomit" definition of the word.

4
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,279
Shut up, Andre. Me and
Rose want to hear it.

5
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,279
"Rose and I," Lissa, "Rose and I."

6
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,847
I think the tune is rather catchy.

7
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,370
Lissa?

8
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,719
Lissa. Hey, Lissa, wake up.

9
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,199
- You're having a bad dream.
- It wasn't a dream.

10
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,079
I know. The accident.

11
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,279
Sorry. Not again.

12
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,719
You know, ever since that night,
I still can't get used to it.

13
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,559
You being in my head,
it's so weird.

14
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,719
You should know by now, with us,

15
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,639
"weird" doesn't begin to cover it.

16
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,959
Why can't you be like
a normal teenage girl

17
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,719
and dream about hot,
naked guys on unicorns?

18
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,679
Does it have to be unicorns?

19
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,479
Of course not. It could be Jet
Skis, mechanical bulls or...

20
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,999
Why do you have a scary poster
of an American ex-president?

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,199
Well, you told me I needed to
blend more into Oregano society.

22
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,719
We're in Oregon. You know
you're completely hopeless

23
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,319
as a human being, right?

24
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,919
I'm still adjusting, Rose.

25
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,599
It's been less than a year since
we ran away from the academy,

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,719
two years since the crash.

27
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,239
Don't you ever stop to think about
everything that we've gone through?

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,039
Stopping is for losers. I only
think about keeping us moving

29
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,679
and keeping you safe.

30
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,079
Does anyone even remember us?

31
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,399
You really think the academy's
still trying to hunt us down?

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,359
Absolutely. I think we may
have to get plastic surgery.

33
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,479
No, don't, please.

34
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,359
- Yes? No?
- No.

35
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,239
- Just like this? You like it?
- Rose, no.

36
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,959
- Whoa. When was the last time you...?
- I'm not hungry.

37
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,319
Is exactly what you say
every time you're hungry.

38
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,807
Come to the kitchen.
I'll make your favorite.

39
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,079
Are you... are you sure about this?

40
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,327
Bon appétit.

41
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,805
- Thanks.
- What are friends for?

42
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,959
You jealous, Oscar?

43
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,003
What are you looking at?

44
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,199
Do I still have anything on my...?

45
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,759
Lissa, smile. They're watching.
Not a drill.

46
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,407
- What's out there? Not Strigoi?
- No, not Strigoi, thank God. Guardians.

47
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,084
Keep close, just like we practiced.

48
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,604
Lissa, go.

49
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,239
- Did you have to hurt them?
- Did I have to hurt them?

50
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,239
You're welcome.
Get out the map, Gandhi.

51
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,799
We'll head north into Canada.

52
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,959
Did you really bring that fur ball?

53
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,969
I couldn't just abandon him.

54
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,519
Hells, yes.

55
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,799
Rose.

56
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,879
Princess Vasilisa Dragomir.

57
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,799
My name is Dimitri Belikov.

58
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,119
I've come to take you back
to St. Vladimir's Academy.

59
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,723
Listen, comrade, to get to her,
you're gonna have to go through me.

60
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,199
<i>Like I said, "weird"
doesn't begin to cover it.</i>

61
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,519
<i>My best friend Lissa
Dragomir is a royal member</i>

62
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,439
<i>of a magical, ancient
race: the Moroi.</i>

63
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,559
<i>The Moroi don't wear black capes,
turn into bats or sleep in coffins.</i>

64
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,319
<i>Daylight annoys yet doesn't kill them,
and they don't sparkle, either.</i>

65
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,199
<i>But, yes, like most creatures with
fangs, the Moroi live off blood.</i>

66
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,519
<i>But they don't live forever,
that's why they need us.</i>

67
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,399
<i>My name is Rose Hathaway and like
these other guys, I'm a Dhampir.</i>

68
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,959
<i>We're the protectors,
the guardians.</i>

69
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,879
<i>Only half Moroi, I can eat a bacon
cheeseburger or whatever else I want.</i>

70
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,279
<i>Dhampir lives are dedicated
to protecting the Moroi.</i>

71
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,279
<i>We live by one simple
expression: they come first.</i>

72
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,039
<i>Only nothing's ever simple.</i>

73
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,679
Handcuffs? There's got to be a
compliment in there somewhere.

74
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,079
So you're taking us
back to the academy.

75
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,770
Tell me, how bad is it gonna be?

76
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,959
Nothing?

77
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,359
You know, I kept the
princess safe and hidden

78
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,679
for an entire year
before you got lucky.

79
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,679
- Congratulations.
- It speaks.

80
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,399
Wow, that's a lot of <i>molnija</i>
marks you got there.

81
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,959
You've killed six Strigoi?

82
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,879
We were afraid that we'd run
into one of them back there.

83
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,999
If you had run into a Strigoi, we
wouldn't be having this conversation.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,328
This is your idea
of a conversation?

85
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,999
Exactly.

86
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,005
We are here. Open the gate.

87
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,119
Anyone there?

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,406
Where is everyone?

89
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,879
- Let's go!
- Lissa!

90
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,159
Move, move!

91
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,650
Stay in the car.

92
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,487
No!

93
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,007
I've got this one. Stay here.

94
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,488
What's going on out there?

95
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,690
Stay here.

96
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,599
Spiridon.

97
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,529
Welcome back, Dimitri.

98
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,359
<i>And then there's group number three:
the bad vampires, the Strigoi.</i>

99
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,639
<i>Evil bloodsuckers that
only come out at night</i>

100
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,039
<i>and can only be killed
by a silver stake.</i>

101
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,919
<i>It takes five of our best
to kill one of their worst.</i>

102
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,599
<i>If you're lucky,
they'll just rip you apart,</i>

103
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,279
<i>but they can also turn
you into one of them.</i>

104
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,559
<i>Strigoi were the true
monsters of our nightmares.</i>

105
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,919
<i>For all the stories, the warnings,
and the training films,</i>

106
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,319
<i>I had never seen one up close.</i>

107
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,322
I told you to stay in the car.

108
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,401
We're clear.

109
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,679
<i>And there it was.
Goodbye, Facebook.</i>

110
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,439
<i>Goodbye, iPhone 5.</i>

111
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,639
<i>Hello, St. Vladimir's.</i>

112
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,559
<i>It is not just another school.</i>

113
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,519
<i>It's another universe.</i>

114
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,959
<i>Moroi and Dhampir students
come from all over the world</i>

115
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,039
<i>to study history, science, math,
and all the other boring stuff,</i>

116
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,519
<i>but around fourth period,</i>

117
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,279
<i>we Dhampir go off and learn fun
new ways to maim and kill,</i>

118
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,639
<i>while, for the Moroi,
it's magic time.</i>

119
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,519
<i>Water, earth, fire, air.</i>

120
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,279
<i>You see, it's not just their diet
that makes the Moroi special,</i>

121
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,439
<i>and some are more
special than others.</i>

122
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,359
<i>Our secret society has
its own government</i>

123
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,239
<i>that alternates leaders
from 12 royal families.</i>

124
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,999
<i>That's Queen Tatiana up top,
but my girl Lissa is in the mix.</i>

125
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,319
<i>You can see why the princess leaving
the academy was such a scandal,</i>

126
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,519
<i>and me helping her was worse.</i>

127
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,159
Damn, back to Vampire Academy.

128
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,279
Please don't say Vampire Academy.
You know how I feel about the "V" word.

129
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,439
Sorry.

130
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,118
It's not like the drinking of blood
is your main source of sustenance.

131
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,959
No, wait, that's
exactly what it is.

132
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,319
They just had to bring us back
in the middle of the night.

133
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,759
So not cool... 1:00 a.m.,
end of fifth period.

134
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,719
Ew, it looks like Aaron's
tried to replace you

135
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,639
with a little keychain version.

136
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,399
God, I hate high school.

137
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,809
Princess. Headmistress
Kirova is ready for you.

138
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,687
Come on.

139
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,199
It's all so unprecedented. I'm at a
loss coming up with proper punishment.

140
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,679
As Lissa's guardian...

141
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,919
You're not an official
guardian, Hathaway.

142
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,119
You are a novice.

143
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,919
You put Vasilisa at the
mercy of the Strigoi,

144
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,359
who would love to destroy,
or even worse, transform...

145
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,119
It was my idea to leave.
Rose only did what...

146
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,519
A trained guardian knows...

147
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,359
Ellen, please.

148
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,359
- Victor.
- Lissa.

149
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,279
Ah.

150
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,199
Prince Dashkov, you look so...

151
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,159
Yes. My Sandovsky's
syndrome has gotten worse.

152
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,959
Oh, Victor, we never
meant to worry you.

153
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,959
Headmistress,

154
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,839
these girls have been
through so much.

155
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,799
As provost of this school

156
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,439
and Lissa's father's oldest friend,

157
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,919
I beg you, look into your heart.

158
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,199
Vasilisa, I have the
utmost sympathy

159
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,639
for the loss of your parents
and your brother, Andre.

160
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,039
But why did you flee a
heavily guarded compound

161
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,319
of Moroi students from
all over the world?

162
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,199
It's not easy to explain.

163
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,879
Lissa felt more in danger here
in your secure environment

164
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,199
than on the outside as
an anonymous teenager.

165
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,246
Fascinating. This is where
you give me specifics.

166
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,999
Where's Ms. Karp?

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,839
She should be here.

168
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,359
She can maybe shed some
light onto the situation.

169
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,291
Ms. Karp is no longer
part of this institution.

170
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,767
I...

171
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,719
This is where you give me specifics.
What do you mean?

172
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,251
It's not important!

173
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,079
Vasilisa Dragomir is from one
of the 12 royal families.

174
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,679
She's the last of
the Dragomir line.

175
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,999
With my condition taking the
Dashkov family out of contention,

176
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,079
Lissa is a possible
successor to the throne.

177
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,079
But you, Hathaway, a Dhampir
girl cut off from the community,

178
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,079
out on civilian streets without a
dime or a Social Security number?

179
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,479
"Blood whore" is such an ugly term,

180
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,639
but I'm sure Moroi men on
business trips would pay a lot

181
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,039
for the especially sweet taste.

182
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,039
Headmistress Kirova.

183
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,439
- They have the bond.
- That's... that's impossible.

184
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,759
In my brief observation period,

185
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,159
Rose could tell what Lissa
was thinking or feeling,

186
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,279
sometimes without being
in the same place.

187
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,679
What a rare and wonderful gift.

188
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,959
This doesn't take away from the fact
that Rose Hathaway is wild, dangerous...

189
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,519
- insubordinate, vulgar.
- Right here, folks. Right here.

190
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,199
But the number of female Dhampir
guardians has gone down

191
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,759
way too much to risk losing
one with such potential.

192
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,399
Ellen, what this impressive new
guardian says seems reasonable.

193
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,839
We're so sorry, Headmistress.

194
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,199
After the crash, I lacked a strong
parental figure to confide in.

195
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,559
I'm afraid Rose and I got
in way over our heads.

196
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,127
Two crazy kids.

197
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,959
Hathaway can stay, but no
extracurricular activities,

198
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,279
no parties, no socializing,
nothing resembling fun.

199
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,199
Take the princess to her royal quarters
and find a broom closet for...

200
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,799
Oh, Rose, I almost forgot.

201
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,639
A telegram.

202
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,604
From Mom.

203
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,079
<i>Kirova flipping out and Lissa
using compulsion to save my ass,</i>

204
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,279
<i>just another night
at St. Vladimir's.</i>

205
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,802
<i>Wow. This place definitely
brought back memories.</i>

206
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,999
Come on, over here.

207
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,999
Before the accident,
my father used to say

208
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,559
that for a Moroi not declaring a magic
is like not going through puberty.

209
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,999
Yeah, and he also used to
say practice during the day

210
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,799
while the world,
your world, is sleeping.

211
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,919
Let's make some magic.

212
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,770
Perfect.

213
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,090
Fire and water.

214
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,041
That's my Moroi.

215
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,479
- Rose...
- Don't leave me hanging.

216
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,359
Rose, you know how I
feel about high-fives.

217
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,559
Ladies. It's after 11:00 a.m., girls.
You should be in bed.

218
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,199
The sun has cleared the trees,
and it won't be kind, Your Highness.

219
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,719
I never got a chance to express
my condolences at the funeral.

220
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,799
But I am so heartened

221
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,599
by the extraordinary
recovery you've both made.

222
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,879
And don't worry, Princess.

223
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,399
I never officially
declared a magic, either.

224
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,602
And look how I turned out.

225
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,639
Ms. Karp's so different
from the other instructors.

226
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,679
It's really refreshing.

227
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,839
The thing that I like the most about her
is she's not strange or creepy at all.

228
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,439
- It's hurt.
- It's more than hurt. It's done.

229
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,085
Leave it. Come on, let...

230
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,249
That was unique.

231
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,239
Lissa.

232
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,965
<i>Lissa?</i>

233
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,679
Hey, Liss.

234
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,919
- It's good to see you.
- Aaron.

235
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,959
Guessing your new girlfriend
practices water magic. Classy.

236
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,759
Yeah. Hey, I'm sorry.

237
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,599
Mia gets jealous, but
deep down, she's sweet.

238
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,319
Back off, bitch. He's mine now.

239
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,479
Very deep down, apparently.

240
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,679
How does it feel to leave at the
top and come back at the bottom?

241
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,359
Don't like what I'm saying?

242
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,759
What are you gonna do about it?

243
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,199
Thanks for asking.

244
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,759
I'm gonna go to a quiet place

245
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,167
and be very depressed
that this is my new life.

246
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,639
<i>All Dhampir novices transfer
to the next training station.</i>

247
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,319
<i>Everyone transfer to their
next training station.</i>

248
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,399
Dimitri is a God.

249
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,199
I hear he tracked
them down to Oregon,

250
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,199
and when Rose tried to put up
a fight, he handed her her ass.

251
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,959
And what was left of that ass got
chewed up by Headmistress Kirova.

252
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,399
Surely, you have something more
interesting to discuss than my ass.

253
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,799
- Your boobies?
- Quit while you're alive, Mason.

254
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,959
What up, baby?

255
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,679
Ooh.

256
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,559
Forgot the secret handshake.
That hurts.

257
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,559
You know, I'm gonna make you
pay for your booby comment.

258
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,439
Old Rose maybe, but you've
missed a year of training.

259
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,479
Yeah, you needed that year to catch
up with what I was born with.

260
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,359
Prepare to...

261
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,039
Ow!

262
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,959
Sorry, Rose. Don't hate me.

263
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,130
I'd hate you more if you held back.

264
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,039
They have these things
in the outside world...

265
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,559
Pinkberry and mini taquitos,

266
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,047
Toaster Strudel...

267
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,328
Oh, no. Not this again.

268
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,559
Don't worry. I don't bite.

269
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,439
Well... only literally.

270
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,599
What are you doing here?

271
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,079
This is where I come to get away.

272
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,319
Hey, this was my... special place

273
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,999
before it was your special place.

274
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,199
What do you have to get
away from, Princess?

275
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,519
What do you know about pain?
Break a nail off in your tiara?

276
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,559
- Excuse me, after a car crash...
- You got off easy.

277
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,923
How dare you! Do you have any idea
what it's like to lose your family?

278
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,799
Oh. Sorry.

279
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,639
You know you're talking to
Christian Ozera, right?

280
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,079
Parents transformed
themselves into Strigoi...

281
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,759
When your folks died,
there was a pretty funeral,

282
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,450
and everybody cried.

283
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,841
When my mother and father were
hunted down, everybody cheered.

284
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,689
I hate what they chose to become...

285
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,639
but they were still my parents.

286
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,279
A Strigoi can't enter holy ground.

287
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,399
Is that why you come to the church?

288
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,399
To prove to everyone
you haven't turned?

289
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,839
Get away from that freak.

290
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,759
Maybe I just like the way the
moonlight hits this spot.

291
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,759
It's as if you're
on another planet.

292
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,799
What was it like...
outside the academy?

293
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,039
It was kind of scary, just
the two of us out there,

294
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,359
but... it was also kind of great.

295
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,959
No one knew who I was.

296
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,399
It does sound kind of great.

297
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,599
But what did you do for blood?

298
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,439
I mean, it's not like you
can pick it up at 7-Eleven.

299
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,759
Or so I've read.

300
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,079
Don't you say anything, girl.
People will get the wrong idea.

301
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,159
You and Rose, all alone on the road.
I have my theories.

302
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,439
Promise me you won't tell
your friends these theories.

303
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,802
I promise you I have
no friends to tell.

304
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,999
<i>Stop staring at each other all...</i>

305
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,239
- ...gooey like.
- Hathaway!

306
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,646
Look alive!

307
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,759
Comrade Belikov.

308
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,319
They ran me ragged. What do
you say we go easy today?

309
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,799
- Perhaps discuss a bit of theory.
- Of course, Rose. I understand.

310
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,119
How do you say
"what a dick" in Russian?

311
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,799
Did you even go to a gym out there?

312
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,479
I took a couple of
spinning classes.

313
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,439
Do you really think beating me up is
gonna help me face a live Strigoi?

314
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,999
After your performance last night,

315
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,039
if you see a Strigoi,
I recommend running.

316
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,919
Now, give me ten sets of lines.

317
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,639
You know, this country has a concept
called "positive reinforcement."

318
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,639
Rose, your bond is special.

319
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,759
You're an ideal choice to guard
Vasilisa when you both graduate.

320
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,839
But if you want to be with her,
you need to be ready for anything.

321
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,519
- Ow!
- Wow.

322
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,759
You look how I feel.

323
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,959
I look how I feel.

324
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,679
How's that "under the radar"
plan working out, Highness?

325
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,479
Not so much.

326
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,119
If you need a shoulder to cry on,

327
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,039
use mine, not Christian Ozera's.

328
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,519
- Who told you?
- I was sort of... you know, there.

329
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,199
Oh, not again. That's so gross.

330
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,479
I know, and it was, like,
the longest one yet.

331
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,439
- You seriously can't turn it off?
- I don't know.

332
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,239
Have you ever seen me
go to the bathroom?

333
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,959
No, but thank you for giving me
something to look forward to.

334
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,519
Oh, shut up. Oh!

335
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,008
No wonder I'm so cranky.
I'm starving.

336
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,959
<i>And now, for the obligatory
cafeteria scene, sort of.</i>

337
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,839
<i>Ever wonder what happened
to that friend of yours,</i>

338
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,199
<i>obsessed with vampire
books and shows?</i>

339
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,439
<i>It's called the human
feeder program.</i>

340
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,679
Human civilians systematically
giving their blood.

341
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,239
I forgot how much
I did not miss this.

342
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,919
Hey, no feeder is brought
here against their will.

343
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,159
They can leave any time
that they want to.

344
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,879
Yeah, it's just a
one-year service limit,

345
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,679
and their memories are officially
compulsed upon departure.

346
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,119
That's completely normal.

347
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,599
Don't feel too sorry
for the feeders.

348
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,439
If you recall, the bitee does get
something out of the process.

349
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,439
- Oh, there's Norrine. Here.
- Hey! Look at you!

350
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,881
- How are you?
- Yeah, good.

351
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,690
Here.

352
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,924
OK.

353
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,079
Rose! Come and keep a
decrepit man company.

354
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,199
Decrepit? You're just saying that so I
won't kick your ass in five-card draw.

355
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,639
Tell me, my darling,
while you were gone,

356
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,319
did Lissa get any
closer to declaring?

357
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,079
There's not a lot of places to
practice magic in Portland.

358
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,239
Oh, true, true.

359
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,519
On the subject of non-declarers,

360
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,759
I want to know why, when I brought
up Ms. Karp's name yesterday,

361
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,159
you all acted like I put a
porcupine in a hot tub.

362
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:18,199
Karp has always been a few
corpuscles shy of a full artery.

363
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,879
She didn't have a Dhampir
to look after her.

364
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,719
I know you have your
special bond with Lissa,

365
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,399
but it makes your escape
that much more alarming.

366
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,399
I'm on your side, Rose,

367
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,399
but we live in a world where
the bogeymen are real.

368
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,039
I know. I'm still a
little freaked-out.

369
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,799
I was there last night when
that Strigoi attacked,

370
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,479
and I just... I totally choked.

371
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,479
Don't be so down on yourself, Rose.

372
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,331
Why are you...

373
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,639
I know you have your life
mission to protect Lissa,

374
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,919
but would you now and again
look out for my Natalie?

375
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,439
Mm...

376
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,199
She's a goofball,
but I do cherish her.

377
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,319
Yes. Well, she worships her father.

378
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,559
She would do anything for you.

379
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,119
I must go to her.

380
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,970
Hey.

381
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,159
Hi.

382
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,479
Do I have anything...

383
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,559
Just fat-lady feeder breath. Here.

384
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,519
So, do you even know your feeders?

385
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,399
Norrine's recently divorced, and
she's catching up on some me-time.

386
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,239
She writes <i>Twilight</i> fan-fiction.

387
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,839
- Have you read any of it?
- Oh, God, no.

388
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,719
Rose, Princess Vasilisa.
I mean, Lissa.

389
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,239
You said I could call you
Lissa, but if I can't anymore,

390
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,999
- that's totally fine.
- Hello, Natalie.

391
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,079
By the soul of St. Vlad's,
so much has happened.

392
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,239
Nothing bigger than your escape,
of course. Why did you escape?

393
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,519
Did you hear Sheila Flight and
Bruce Bugsburger broke up?

394
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,119
Apparently, Bruce still has his baby
fangs, and it freaks Sheila out.

395
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,559
<i>And you know about
Tess and Jackson?</i>

396
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,479
Each was afraid that they're
gonna be the ones to get dumped,

397
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,039
so they started this really weird
rumor. I can't really remember...

398
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,759
Natalie? Do you take
gossip requests?

399
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,599
Mia Rinaldi over there, is she new?

400
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,159
Well, she's been around,
but new haircut, new fangs,

401
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,799
and now she's hanging out
with all the royals.

402
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,919
Rose Hathaway, what
are you doing here?

403
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,839
Surely you would not deprive a
girl of her religious needs?

404
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,199
Just get inside.

405
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,079
The debate team, and
I don't really know if I...

406
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,399
Speaking of extracurricular activities
that I miss, is that Jesse?

407
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,239
The hot get hotter.

408
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,519
Yeah, Jesse's still the academy's
number one wet dreamboat.

409
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,399
He has a terrible personality.

410
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,759
Jesse has a personality?

411
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,159
I didn't know.

412
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,719
Don't judge a book by its content.

413
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,399
You know this is a church, right?

414
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,239
Gosh, if only there was a way

415
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,919
that we could set up a double
date with Ray over there.

416
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,479
You can't tell me that there's no
inbreeding amongst you royals.

417
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,119
Exhibit Ray.

418
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,079
Ray just doesn't know how
to express his feelings.

419
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,679
You know, when a boy throws
sand in a girl's face,

420
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,599
it really means that...

421
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,370
Never mind.

422
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,841
Yeah.

423
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,039
- Your friend's a tool.
- Don't change the subject.

424
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,759
You, me... you and me.

425
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,719
Yeah, but don't you
have a girlfriend?

426
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,919
- Probably.
- Oh, you are bad.

427
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,599
What's so bad about bad?

428
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,719
You do understand, Rose,
that even the walls of a church

429
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,279
can't protect a true sinner
from a good lightning bolt?

430
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,689
Save a seat for me in the
Dhampir section, you dork.

431
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,399
Mason likes you so much.

432
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,679
Why can't you go outwith a
nice, funny guy like him?

433
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,679
I know. If only I could put
Mason into Jesse's body.

434
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,559
God can be cruel.

435
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,650
Yes. That's true.

436
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,290
Come on. Let's go.

437
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,999
<i>Following God's path is never easy.</i>

438
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,839
Even St. Vladimir had
difficulty controlling

439
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,039
and understanding his powers.

440
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,119
But he was bound to a
loving Dhampir guardian

441
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,359
who always knew what was
in his heart and mind.

442
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,119
Shadow-kissed Anna.

443
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,919
Shadow-kissed Rose,

444
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,159
you're bound to Lissa, and
it's up to you to help her.

445
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,759
What's so funny?
Did you write that?

446
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,599
Down, Dhampir,
you saw me in church.

447
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,359
Listen, Gap Kids, if I find out

448
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,639
that you had anything to do
with that, I will rip your...

449
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,999
You'll what? You're on lockdown.
You breathe the wrong way

450
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,239
and you're out on the pavement
doing amateur blood whore porn.

451
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,679
Listen up, that's enough
excitement for a Sunday night.

452
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,963
Everyone back to your dorms
until further notice.

453
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,759
Royal rec room, high noon.
I've changed my mind.

454
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,319
I'm feeling bad.

455
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,885
Good.

456
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,479
We Moroi may not burst
into flames like Strigoi,

457
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,279
but daylight still stings.

458
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,244
Poor thing.

459
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,399
Did you have jobs out in the world?

460
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,879
What about an iPhone?

461
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,924
- What's a hashtag?
- Please, stop talking.

462
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,959
Whoa, horsey, what do
you think you're doing?

463
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,165
Come on, Rose. A bite while
you're going at it is the best.

464
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,559
Stop it!

465
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,599
Oh... I know that look.
You've done it before.

466
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,479
I would never let a guy
degrade me like that.

467
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,639
Not a guy, of course. Lissa.

468
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,479
We've all been
wondering how she fed.

469
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,519
Once you've had fang,
Rose, you never go...

470
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,639
Daytime fraternization. Forbidden.

471
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,559
I get it. Chill, chill.

472
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,759
Again, Jesse? Back to your room!

473
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,281
What?

474
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,370
Lissa, what are you doing?

475
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,839
- Rose?
- Lissa's in trouble.

476
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,879
I heard... I heard a noise.

477
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,319
Lissa...

478
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,719
There's so much blood.

479
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,759
It's starting again, isn't it?

480
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,319
I tried, Rose, I tried
to bring it back,

481
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,807
but... it was too late.

482
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,241
Get over here and
comfort her, jerk.

483
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,169
It's gonna be OK.

484
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,279
- What the hell is Kirova doing?
- She's giving Vasilisa a sedative,

485
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,879
and we are increasing
her guardian detail.

486
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,959
Our security system is geared
to keeping Strigoi out,

487
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,999
not dealing with teenage
bullying within.

488
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,799
Bullying? You really think
that's all this is?

489
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,162
- Rose...
- Sorry.

490
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,959
Thank you for not saying
anything to Kirova about...

491
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:53,279
it was foolish of me to assume you'd
be above such 17-year-old silliness.

492
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,563
Hmm. Hmm...

493
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,399
The sunlight, it's nice.

494
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,559
I miss it.

495
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,039
Stupid vampire timetable.

496
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,971
The little sacrifices we make.

497
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,039
And the big ones.

498
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,079
My 17-year-old silliness,
that was the past.

499
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,879
That was an hour ago.

500
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,479
Are you trying to tell me you're
suddenly mature and responsible?

501
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,319
I'm trying to tell you that
I want to be, I have to be.

502
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,079
Teach me something
more than doing laps.

503
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,679
I know enough about running away.

504
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,479
And next time we meet,
teach me how to fight.

505
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,519
Pipe down. Let's pick
up where we left off.

506
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,919
After the tribunals
in Romania... Mia!

507
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,999
You're usually a lot better
at passing on notes.

508
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,119
- Having an off-day?
- Oh, no, Mr. Meisner,

509
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,085
please don't read this note
out loud, I beg of you.

510
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,959
"I'll bet that drama queen..."

511
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,719
"I mean, drama princess,
killed that fox herself"

512
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,999
"to distract the school
from her real secret."

513
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,359
Don't go on.

514
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,319
Mr. Meisner, you're being used as a tool
to broadcast Mia's vile propaganda.

515
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,639
Are you calling me a tool?

516
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,719
- If she's not, I will.
- What was that, Hathaway?

517
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,759
Now I'm curious.
"So, it turns out the reason"

518
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,119
"that Lissa survived so
long on the outside"

519
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,919
"is she used Rose as a
personal feed bag."

520
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,319
Settle down!

521
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,081
Dhampir-Moroi mastication is
a very serious allegation.

522
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,119
I'm gonna pretend
I never read this.

523
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,839
Everyone turn to page
three of your handout.

524
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,359
But, Mr. Meisner, you
left out the best part.

525
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,199
About me and my boy, Jesse,
and that Dhamp tramp last night.

526
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,079
- What?
- Truth hurts, blood whore.

527
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,319
Christian, cut it out!

528
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,519
Kindly report to Headmistress
Kirova's office, Mr. Ozera.

529
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,246
- Down the hall, turn left.
- Like I need directions.

530
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,119
Lissa, Lissa, wait up.

531
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,679
Not here, not in front of everyone.

532
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,839
What was that back there?
Fire magic in class?

533
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,359
- Uh-oh. Lovers' quarrel.
- Rose, I bleed for you.

534
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,919
No, it's Rose who
does the bleeding.

535
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,799
You can't beat up everyone
we have a problem with!

536
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,959
- Well, I can try.
- What is going on?

537
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,759
I told you, Jesse and I barely even
made out, and Ray wasn't even there,

538
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,279
so I don't even know
what he's talking about.

539
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,959
OK, yes. Teenage boys are
weak and sweaty piglets.

540
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,279
It is our covenant...
I'm talking about you and me.

541
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,919
How did they find out
about the feeding?

542
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,719
You know, when Jesse's fangs
came poking out, did you...

543
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,039
No, not even.

544
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,839
But... he did kind of suspect.

545
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,407
Lissa, let me explain, please!
Let me talk...

546
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,319
Is it true?

547
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,119
You're gonna have to be
more specific, Mason.

548
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,079
Jesse and Ray, and not just
hooking up, fanging up.

549
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,799
- They claim they fed while...
- Absolutely not...

550
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,239
Well, actually, Jesse and I
did make out a little, but...

551
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,879
- Where there's smoke, there's fire.
- Leave fire out of this.

552
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,199
You girls throw yourselves
at any douche bag

553
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,638
who happens to be Moroi and royal.

554
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:02,079
Whoa, Duckie. I do not have time to
deal with your feelings right now.

555
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,169
OK.

556
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,244
Oh, God, come on, Lissa-vision.
Where are you when I need you?

557
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,959
You should thank me for
changing the news cycle.

558
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,679
It took something epic to take
animal death and blood whoring

559
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,359
off the Vampire Academy front page.

560
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,599
Please don't say "Vampire Academy."

561
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,519
I find the term to be quite...

562
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,359
You set someone on fire!

563
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,439
Come on. Did you see
any burn marks on him?

564
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,039
Now whoever killed that fox is
going to feel the real heat.

565
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,879
Is this your idea of chivalry?

566
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,359
You did not just
flip your hair back.

567
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,559
That's your move.
She's flirting, folks.

568
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,919
If we used our magic as a weapon,

569
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,319
instead of just for warm and
fuzzy classroom exercises,

570
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,199
the Strigoi wouldn't
be picking us off.

571
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,119
- Yes, but the rules forbid...
- The rules?

572
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,599
Lissa, I've seen the way you tilt
your head from time to time.

573
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,919
I'm very sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

574
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,999
Hey, compulsion must have been
a necessity in the outside world.

575
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,524
You can't know all my secrets. Yet.

576
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,644
Queen Tatiana?

577
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,079
I hope I did not take you
too much by surprise,

578
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:25,879
but sometimes your queen awakens
with a need to look upon her lovelies.

579
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,560
Where's Vasilisa?

580
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,968
Vasilisa Dragomir?

581
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,519
Please come up and let
me see the princess.

582
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,359
Not a day goes by
where we don't lament

583
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,079
the loss of your parents
and your brother.

584
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:48,764
The Dragomir name represents
the finest of Moroi qualities.

585
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,839
While you, Vasilisa Dragomir,

586
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,089
the last of the Dragomir line...

587
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,759
if you are our future,
I am less than impressed.

588
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:06,879
The power that comes from royal
blood must be used responsibly.

589
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,239
While you... you give us
dead animals, blood games,

590
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,919
escapes to Oregon. Shameful!

591
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,839
- Queen Tatiana, I can explain.
- Shh, shh, shh.

592
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,279
Not now, dear.

593
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,999
However, I have every confidence

594
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,519
that our dear Vasilisa
will turn things around.

595
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,009
Now, let us adjourn
to the banquet hall.

596
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,759
My father would never have
done something like that.

597
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,479
After all that Lissa has been through,
to be shamed by our queen bee?

598
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,239
Don't you mean queen bee-etch?

599
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,159
You don't talk to Lissa like that.

600
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,250
So much for round-the-clock
guardians.

601
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,006
Lissa?

602
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,719
Oh, my God.

603
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,679
- By the soul of St. Vladimir.
- Who would do something like this? Why?

604
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,519
Go to the wall, Nat. Talk to me.

605
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,279
What?

606
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,323
Yeah, OK.

607
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,610
Oh, God.

608
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,479
- It's fresh, and it's Moroi.
- OK, can you tell me if it's royal?

609
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,490
- Don't be absurd.
- Said the girl licking the wall.

610
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,799
I can tell you it's more
than one person's blood.

611
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,799
They misspelled "beware."

612
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,799
Lissa, I can clean it up.
I'm sorry.

613
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,439
Leave it. The misspelling shows it was
just a bunch of stupid teenagers.

614
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,919
OK, you know what, I'm gonna
go start packing. I'm really...

615
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,359
No, Rose. We can't just keep running
away, at least until we know

616
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,639
what we're running away from.

617
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,719
Ooh! A mystery, how exciting.

618
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,679
We can be like three
Nancy Drews trying...

619
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,079
I hate mysteries. I would prefer a
good Strigoi attack at this point

620
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,159
because at least I'd know what
those homicidal bloodsuckers want.

621
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,439
No more. I am taking our
dear beloved queen's advice,

622
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,639
and I'm turning things around.

623
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,479
Jesse and Ray are pawns.
Mia is the mastermind.

624
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,359
Yeah, but we didn't even
really know Mini-Mia

625
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,119
when we were compelled to
leave for the first time.

626
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,279
Ms. Karp is the one that
we should be focused on.

627
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,239
Do what you have to do, Dhampir. I am
done trying to crawl under the radar.

628
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,119
It's not possible, and...
it's not effective.

629
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,919
Besides, I have a way of getting
people to see my side of the story.

630
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,319
Don't worry, Natalie
knows of my skills.

631
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,119
It was too exhausting
keeping it from her.

632
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,319
Are you going to use
compulsion on Mia?

633
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,239
Where's the fun in that?

634
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,919
I'm going to use compulsion
on everyone but Mia.

635
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,559
But compulsion on
such a large scale...

636
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,559
Magic should be used for something more
than warm and fuzzy classroom exercises.

637
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,519
Oh, God, and now you're
quoting Christian?

638
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,919
- What?
- Yeah, I was there.

639
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,639
And the poison that that freak

640
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,719
is pumping into your brain
makes me want to vomit.

641
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,639
Lissa, I'm the reckless, and
you're the cautious, remember?

642
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,039
You've already taken too
many hits for me, Rose.

643
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,159
Look, it's your turn
to have a little cry,

644
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,727
and it's my turn to
kick a little ass.

645
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,799
Whoa!

646
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,639
You do not jump out at
a guardian like that.

647
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,039
I think you mean novice.

648
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,239
Just wanted to know
if Lissa was all right.

649
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,279
Queen Tatiana had no right
to bring up family.

650
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,439
- I should go and talk to Lissa.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

651
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,799
But I do. Lissa and I have a bond.

652
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,399
A bond?

653
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,279
Listen, Chris,
just stay away from her.

654
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,239
She's had her little flirtation
with the dark side, and she's done.

655
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,079
Lissa used to like Hot Topic,
too, and then she turned 12.

656
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,639
I was only concerned.

657
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,319
There's a fine line between
concerned and stalker.

658
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,479
Seriously, Christian, go away.

659
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,967
It's what Lissa wants.

660
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,285
OK.

661
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,239
I thought we'd practice out
here, away from there.

662
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,519
Dimitri, I know you must
have heard some rumors.

663
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,439
All that high-school <i>der'mo</i>
stays back there, not here.

664
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,999
This is life and death.

665
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,959
The silver. Don't be afraid of it.

666
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,359
Besides the sun, this stake is your
only friend against the Strigoi.

667
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,199
But you must subdue the monster
and bring yourself to kill.

668
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,079
Yeah, killing Strigoi is
what it's all about, right?

669
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,039
Most Strigoi were once Moroi.

670
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,079
Some turn themselves Strigoi by
killing during the feeding process.

671
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,719
But many are turned by force.

672
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,719
If you are going to thrust, thrust.

673
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,519
My point is you might have known
one personally, as a friend.

674
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,529
Can you kill someone
you used to know?

675
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,279
I... If it was them
or me or Lissa...

676
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,839
You hesitate, and that
hesitation could kill you.

677
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:39,119
You have to keep telling yourself that
they aren't the same people you knew.

678
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,719
Good. Very good.

679
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,279
I don't mean to belittle
what you are going through.

680
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,079
The queen crossed a line.

681
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,999
But the Dhampir must always bow down.
I get it. The Moroi come first.

682
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,999
Not always. My father was a Moroi.

683
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,239
He visited Russia once a year.

684
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,359
He liked to hit my mother.

685
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,479
When I was old enough,
I liked to hit him.

686
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,239
He stopped visiting.

687
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,239
- How old is old enough?
- Ten.

688
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,439
The only parent I've ever
really had is the academy.

689
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,039
Your mother is one
of the most feared

690
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,559
and respected Dhampir
guardians in the world.

691
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,399
I see you finally
read her telegram.

692
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,039
You want to know what it said?

693
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,599
"Glad you're alive. What you
did was inexcusable. Mom."

694
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,759
Aw.

695
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,839
What do you know of
your Moroi father?

696
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:29,199
That he must have had dark
eyes and amazing hair.

697
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,799
When I start killing
Strigoi left and right,

698
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,639
I'm gonna have to cut
it all off, won't I?

699
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,999
Sorry. That sounded really girly.

700
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,159
You can wear it up.

701
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,639
Doesn't a Dhampir need to keep
their <i>molnija</i> marks exposed?

702
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,162
Don't ever cut your hair.
Wear it up.

703
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,559
You have to admire our queen.

704
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,359
Her elegance, her dignity, her
ability to recognize trash.

705
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,359
And my good mood is over.

706
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,803
You know, "beware" isn't
spelled with an "H" in it.

707
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,679
- Hey.
- Where's Lissa?

708
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,199
I haven't seen her, but guess what?

709
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,599
I heard that Mia and
Aaron are going

710
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,239
on that field trip to
the hemoglobin factory.

711
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,039
I figured it gives us a
chance to raid their rooms...

712
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,211
- Pretend to be talking to me.
- But I am talking to you.

713
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,799
It's nasty. If you
guys were doing it,

714
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,239
I'm not surprised Rose got
addicted and necked with Jesse.

715
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,119
She didn't do it with Jesse.

716
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,959
And it's not like we fornicated.
We just didn't have any feeders.

717
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,079
It's no big deal, Camilla.

718
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,959
Yeah, it's no big deal.
I mean, Jesse's a liar.

719
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,599
What are you guys doing tonight?

720
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,599
Shannon and I are going to her
room to study for Meisner's test.

721
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,079
Invite me.

722
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,759
Lissa, you want to
study with us tonight?

723
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,849
<i>Sure.</i>

724
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,319
Oh, look. It's the
queen's court jester.

725
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,919
You can't talk to me like that.

726
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,359
The queen treats me like a daughter,
so you should be envious.

727
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,639
You're buds with Mia. What
secrets are you keeping?

728
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,039
- I like to wear my mommy's knick...
- Not about you.

729
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,969
Secrets about Mia.

730
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,959
- Busted.
- Ow.

731
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,759
Did you witness how amazing I was?

732
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,799
I felt it. Using the power has an
effect, a cost, on both of us.

733
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,159
Look at you, you're shaking.
I'm shaking.

734
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,639
Three cups of coffee shaking.

735
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,079
More like 18 cups,
dark roast, no room.

736
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,919
- I got it, the computer.
- What?

737
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,639
I told you.
Mia's on a field trip...

738
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,319
Hey, you. I'm sorry I haven't
been to church in a while, but...

739
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,079
It's OK. You don't have
to pretend anymore.

740
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,039
You've had your little
flirtation with the dark side.

741
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,799
- Check that box and move on.
- What are you talking about?

742
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,890
But, hey, nice hypocrisy
on the magic use.

743
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,839
So what? A stolen laptop.

744
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,239
Kirova strangled Internet
access years ago.

745
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,319
Yeah, St. Vlad's operates
on a closed network,

746
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,359
but there is more to a
person than status updates.

747
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,919
There's photos, receipts,
inter-academy e-mails.

748
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,639
You're making my brain bleed.

749
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,968
But you were sure right
about cuckoo Christian.

750
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,721
What a whack job.

751
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,999
Are you seriously going to
that study group with Camilla?

752
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,119
You know, you don't have to
use compulsion to be popular.

753
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,599
You may not recall, but you can
be quite charming on your own.

754
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,399
Who has the time? Natalie,
return that computer.

755
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,679
Later, losers.

756
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,999
Gosh.

757
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,279
I wish Lissa could compulse
Ray into being nicer.

758
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,959
And taking my virginity.

759
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,799
No one has ever
really seen me naked.

760
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,959
- Moroi, Dhampir, human, mineral.
- Uh-huh.

761
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,719
I once turned a plant around because
I was too shy to change in front of it.

762
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,239
You know I can't
un-hear this, right?

763
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,359
- Sorry. Yeah, I...
- It's OK.

764
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,799
Though I'm not much better.
I'm crushing on my mentor, Dimitri,

765
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,039
who's, like, old enough to be my...

766
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,799
Not my father... like an uncle.

767
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,559
Like a disturbingly sexy uncle.

768
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,807
Andre?

769
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,719
What the hell is this?

770
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,119
Goodness gracious.

771
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,479
Andre, Andre?

772
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,039
That's Lissa's brother, isn't it?

773
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,359
Andre could have, like, any girl
he wanted, and he usually did.

774
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,399
Most of the girls knew the drill.
It was down low, no commitments and...

775
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,119
This is the face of a girl
who did not know the drill.

776
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,559
Holy moly.

777
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,919
Mia's not just angry at Lissa.
She despises the whole Dragomir line.

778
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,519
Right, which makes her someone willing
to take things to a whole other level.

779
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,479
OK, all right. Take this
back to Mia's room.

780
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,125
- Yeah?
- OK.

781
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,406
See ya.

782
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,999
Hey. To what do I owe this honor?

783
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,406
Can we talk, Oscar?

784
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,279
<i>I'm worried about Lissa.</i>

785
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,639
<i>I love that our princess is learning
that the best defense is a good offense,</i>

786
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,679
<i>and believe me, I am all for putting
mad munchkin Mia in her place,</i>

787
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:46,319
<i>but this Operation Brainwash is turning
Lissa into something she's not.</i>

788
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,602
<i>She can't see that. I can.</i>

789
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,126
<i>It's like I feel Lissa's
feelings more than she does.</i>

790
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,719
<i>I need to put on my game face.</i>

791
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,359
<i>Can't wait around for my
next psychedelic flashback.</i>

792
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,999
<i>The stakes are too high.</i>

793
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,519
<i>Get it?</i>

794
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,039
<i>Dhampir? Fight with stakes?</i>

795
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,759
<i>Best defense, good offense.</i>

796
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,559
I knew you'd improve.

797
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,039
No fair learning from a god.

798
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,080
I heard you were good at
taking on two guys at once.

799
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,239
Rose, uh, about Jesse and Ray...

800
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,439
- Mason...
- No, not that.

801
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,759
In the locker room, it was weird.

802
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,599
<i>They had these bandages
on their wrists.</i>

803
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,279
<i>I don't know if it means anything.</i>

804
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,799
<i>Covered wrists?</i>

805
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,651
- Is that some new Moroi thing?
- Check out Mia.

806
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,759
- She's getting away.
- Let her.

807
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,439
Kirova's the one I
should be tracking.

808
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,959
I need to break into
Kirova's office today

809
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,159
when the fang gang is asleep, OK?

810
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,719
There's a file in there that
could be the key to my past,

811
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,239
my present and my future.

812
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,279
That's it?

813
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,479
Sounds cool.

814
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,479
Forty-five minutes of silence.

815
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,359
It has to be a Rose
Hathaway record.

816
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,919
OK.

817
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,879
What do you know about Ms. Karp?

818
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,639
Karp? She retired
before I even arrived.

819
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,439
Kirova, Victor, you.

820
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,929
I ask about Karp, and it's no eye
contact and a subject change.

821
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,639
Enough. Your training of
late has been quite...

822
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,999
- ...fine.
- Fine? That's it?

823
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,999
What do you want me to say?

824
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,879
That you are a
remarkable quick study?

825
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,359
That you bring originality
to classic moves?

826
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,839
Yeah, I want you to
say all those things.

827
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,769
Good night, Rose.

828
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,879
What did I do wrong? I had you.

829
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,399
The battle cry was
your first mistake.

830
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,559
I like your laugh.
Singular, not plural.

831
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,599
It's the first time I've heard it.

832
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,559
So even if I wouldn't have screamed,
you still would have stopped me, right?

833
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,399
Probably, but nice initiative.

834
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,161
Keep trying those surprise attacks.
It's good training for both of us.

835
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:26,321
So, uh... you have any other
moves you want to show me?

836
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,998
<i>I give it and they take it, but when it
comes back, it's not the same, is it?</i>

837
00:46:58,999 --> 00:47:00,719
<i>I give it and they take it,</i>

838
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,640
<i>but when it comes back,
it's not the same, is it?</i>

839
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,839
<i>They're coming to get me.</i>

840
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,559
<i>But they want something
that I can't give them.</i>

841
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,439
<i>Those of us who never declared, those of
us who have powers that have no name,</i>

842
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,279
<i>there's only so much we can do,
only so much we can handle.</i>

843
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,319
<i>I should have gone with Vasilisa.
I should have.</i>

844
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,799
<i>I'm so alone.</i>

845
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,239
<i>The clarity of the
darkness beckons.</i>

846
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,639
<i>I just want it to go
away, the shaking,</i>

847
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,811
<i>the scratching,
nightmares, all go away.</i>

848
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,319
Lissa. The king and queen of
the school together again,

849
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,719
- the way it should be.
- Lissa!

850
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,919
It's you and I who are
destined to be together.

851
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,359
Let me handle this.

852
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:50,119
Look at what you made me do to
myself, just like my damn parents.

853
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,041
Lissa!

854
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,519
I have a new family now.

855
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,039
Strigoi brothers and
sisters, attack!

856
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,239
- Rose, what's happening?
- Stay close, right behind me,

857
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,680
just like we practiced.

858
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,319
OK. It's not looking great,

859
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,522
but we will get through this,
Lissa, we always do.

860
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,125
Dimitri?

861
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,679
Oh, Rose, you worry too much.

862
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,039
Lissa, no.

863
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,839
What are friends for?

864
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,280
No.

865
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,610
No!

866
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,639
Rose, are you there?

867
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,922
Did you feel that one?

868
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,730
What a weird dream.

869
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:22,319
Yeah. Yeah, Liss, weird dream.

870
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,639
Don't you dare feel sorry for me.

871
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,844
Feel sorry for her,
for the princess.

872
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,359
I lied.

873
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,079
Lissa doesn't think that
you're a creepy stalker.

874
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,359
She actually likes you.

875
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,839
Then why did you...?

876
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,599
Because I think that
you're a creepy stalker,

877
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,879
and I actually don't
like you, but...

878
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,970
I like the way that Lissa
feels when she's around you.

879
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,799
So what?

880
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,799
Look at her. She's back on top.

881
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,399
She's not happy. She's not
herself, not as she wants to be.

882
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,719
Trust me, I know, Christian.

883
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,959
I can f...

884
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,479
Shadow-kissed Anna
did all she could,

885
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,639
but on some days, Satan's darkness

886
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,919
seeped into St. Vladimir,
weakening his health and mind.

887
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,919
See, Christian, I don't
want that to be Lissa.

888
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,039
You are the phantom here. You must know
where they keep the books and scrolls

889
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,479
and whatnot, and I need to
figure out what her abilities...

890
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,799
You sabotaged the first good thing
to happen to me in a long time,

891
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,207
and now you want me to help you?

892
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,885
Ugh. God.

893
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,368
Princess party in
the royal rec room.

894
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,199
There's my blood bitch.
What took you so long?

895
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,559
It's great that you
can joke about it.

896
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,759
Lissa, listen. A lot has happened.

897
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,879
We have to sit down and
have a real conversation.

898
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,050
Stop being so serious, Rose.
It's a party.

899
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,690
- Hey, Natalie.
- Hi.

900
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,164
Awesome party, huh?

901
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,319
Check this.

902
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,839
Can you say "keg magic"?

903
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,599
Wow, Lissa, you can
really do it all.

904
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,879
Well, of course I can.
I'm the princess.

905
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,999
But doing it all is wrong, right?

906
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,599
Fire, air, fire, air, fire,

907
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,799
air, fire, air,

908
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,719
- fire...
- Hey.

909
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,651
Aaron.

910
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,559
Rose! Where are you going?

911
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,239
You weren't just going to
bail without saying goodbye.

912
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,679
I need to go home
and sleep you off.

913
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,679
Oh, is the bond making
you as buzzed as I am?

914
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,199
God, you are burning
us both out on magic.

915
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,999
Stop worrying. It's working.

916
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,439
Weeks have gone by,
and Mia is toast.

917
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,919
No threats, no notes, no foxes.

918
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,639
You're just bummed that I, not
you, have neutralized the threat.

919
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,759
You neutralized a threat,
not "the" threat.

920
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,279
And Aaron, seriously,

921
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,239
you really want to show up to
the Equinox Dance with that?

922
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,119
He's... cute.

923
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,199
And incredibly boring.

924
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,519
You think everyone's boring.

925
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,679
Christian's not.

926
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,279
No, you were right about him.

927
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:29,679
I knew "little flirtation with the dark
side" sounded like one of your lines.

928
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,799
- Sorry.
- You know what? You can have Christian.

929
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,119
You're both savages.

930
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,359
Lissa, what I've been
trying to tell you

931
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,279
is that you're making
this about high school,

932
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,759
and it's about something more.

933
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,879
Natalie... Are you nuts?
What are you thinking?

934
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,519
Trust me, you do not want to have
to get a nose job in Montana!

935
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,559
Sorry. I'm sorry. It's...

936
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,919
When you both left the
party, I had no one to...

937
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,959
Everyone kept staring
at me, so I left,

938
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,279
and on my way back to the
dorms, I swear, someone...

939
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,879
more like something,
started to follow me.

940
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,199
I just... I don't know. I'm
probably just being paranoid.

941
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,279
That's not paranoia.

942
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,719
- That's a psi-hound.
- Rose thinks everything is a psi-hound.

943
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,319
What's a psi-hound?

944
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,888
- What's my backpack doing over there?
- Lissa, no.

945
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,886
Lissa!

946
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,999
Oscar! Oh, my God.

947
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,329
Oscar.

948
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,570
- Lissa, just...
- No, Rose!

949
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,679
Shadow-kissed Rose,
you're bound to Lissa,

950
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,319
and it's up to you to help her.

951
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,279
Don't you understand?

952
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,679
The more that Lissa uses her
powers, the worse it'll get.

953
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,079
The more dangerous it will be.

954
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:24,439
They came for me.
They'll come for her.

955
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,839
What are you talking about?
Is it the Strigoi?

956
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,319
This isn't about Strigoi.

957
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:34,319
Not everything to be feared roams
outside the gates of St. Vladimir's.

958
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,679
- I don't understand.
- Oh, you couldn't understand it.

959
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,359
You don't have to understand.
Look at me.

960
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,199
No, please, Ms. Karp,
not compulsion, please.

961
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,119
- I beg of you, please!
- I'm not taking your memories away.

962
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,879
Just hiding them for a bit.

963
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,479
Lissa's life is in peril.

964
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,319
You only need to know you have to
get her away from the academy.

965
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:56,999
Forget everything I've said
until it's time not to forget.

966
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,399
I guess you could say that
it was half-repression

967
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,319
and half-compulsion,
and when you asked me

968
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,279
why we left the academy
in the first place,

969
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,799
a part of me couldn't remember.

970
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,679
I just knew that we had to get out.

971
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,919
Outrageous.

972
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,439
What Headmistress
Kirova means to say

973
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,199
is that it was brave of you
to come forward, Rose.

974
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,399
Well, I'm doing it for Lissa.
She needs help.

975
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,599
But is it really true she
can bring the dead to life?

976
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,919
Dead's dead... but from
the brink of death.

977
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,719
Not since St. Vladimir, and he
never declared a magic, either.

978
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,799
But there is no actual proof
to anything you're saying.

979
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,319
We found no cameras,
and the compulsion alone

980
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,039
can only be done in specific
environments by trained professionals.

981
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,323
Well, Lissa had no problem doing it
to you, right in your own office.

982
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,559
Surely, you had to wonder why you
didn't just throw me out of school.

983
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,239
It's outrageous.

984
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,679
Enough, please.

985
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,559
Ms. Sonya Karp. I want to
see the Day Six footage.

986
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,319
I've had a rough night.

987
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,999
Don't make me crawl through
a ventilator shaft

988
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,719
and lower myself down into the
security center on a wire.

989
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:07,799
Headmistress, we have no right to keep
Rose in the dark for as long as we have.

990
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,439
All right. All right.

991
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,564
Take her downstairs.
Show her everything.

992
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,159
Show us Karp Day Six,
please. Thank you.

993
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,439
I knew this is what
you were looking for.

994
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,879
Couple months after you left,
Ms. Karp had a complete breakdown.

995
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,399
And did the doctors
find a way to help her?

996
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,648
She found a way to help herself.

997
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,719
Karp was not like the others.

998
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,479
She didn't become Strigoi for
the power or the immortality.

999
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,719
She just... wanted
the pain to go away.

1000
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:57,599
Nobody likes to talk about it,
but the most effective way

1001
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:01,679
for the undeclared to take
away their special anxiety

1002
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,851
is for them to take a
life and become Strigoi.

1003
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,039
Strigoi have an inner clarity.

1004
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,439
No feelings. No worries.

1005
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,644
No weakness.

1006
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,479
She got away.

1007
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,762
We don't know where she is now.

1008
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,279
Roza? Roza, calm down.

1009
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,159
- I'll protect you.
- Roza?

1010
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,519
It's not Karp. It's Lissa.

1011
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,839
She's upstairs, and she's...
she's pissed.

1012
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,159
Cuts on my arm?
Is that what she said?

1013
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,319
And without the use
of a blade, no less.

1014
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,359
I know I've been having
trouble declaring a magic,

1015
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,919
but that seems a pretty
pointless skill.

1016
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,724
Allow me to put your mind at ease.

1017
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,159
Rose is a dear friend, but she
has a talent for tall tales.

1018
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,319
Kirova's letting herself be compulsed
even after I gave the compulsion speech!

1019
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,719
It's classic!
Ever since the accident,

1020
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,639
it's like my life has
been on autopilot.

1021
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,159
I guess in Ms. Karp's own
spooky way, she was trying

1022
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,639
to help me figure it all out,
but who do I have now?

1023
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,719
There is another person
who can help you.

1024
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,319
He is on our flags,
posters, uniforms

1025
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,879
and the statue in the
middle of the school.

1026
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,286
St. Vladimir?

1027
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,211
OK. I'm on it.

1028
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,119
So, is this where the
outcast losers hang out?

1029
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,159
- How did you know...?
- Books on St. Vladimir. Now.

1030
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,879
Before, I was asking.
This is me telling.

1031
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,519
- God, you're annoying.
- I'm right that this could help Lissa.

1032
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,919
Yeah. That's what's
so annoying. Come on.

1033
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,799
God, what's a girl got to
do to get a definition

1034
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,119
- of "shadow-kissed" up in this...
- Check this out.

1035
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,079
"Vladimir had mastered
a very rare magic,

1036
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,479
and this magic had a name: Spirit."

1037
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,399
All this time, Lissa's
been beating herself up

1038
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,919
about not being able
to declare a magic.

1039
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,479
Oh, my God, if she only knew.

1040
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,599
This makes Lissa more special

1041
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,639
and valuable than
I ever even imagined.

1042
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,199
I guess I should be happy that the bad
guys aren't trying to kill Lissa,

1043
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,239
but it kind of just makes things
more sick and disgusting.

1044
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,599
What do they want from Lissa?

1045
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,719
What is the point of killing her
cat and setting up cameras?

1046
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,599
- Who could be that cruel?
- Headmistress Kirova could be.

1047
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,239
And Mia likes to film her pranks.

1048
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,679
- That...
- I know.

1049
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,359
Both a little on the nose, but...

1050
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,079
No, maybe they're so obvious
that they're not obvious.

1051
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,879
I did see Kirova with
Mia the other night.

1052
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,559
OK, my conspiracy theory of choice

1053
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,839
is that someone might be
trying to drive Lissa mad,

1054
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,839
to take her out of
throne contention.

1055
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:27,079
I mean, we all know Queen
Tatiana has her issues.

1056
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,719
All three witches could
be working together.

1057
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,199
I like the way your mind works.
Just hold that thought.

1058
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,359
"At times, after the expense of
power and in times of trauma,

1059
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,879
Vladimir's agony would manifest
directly onto his skin."

1060
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,119
So this proves that
Lissa's not a freak.

1061
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:42,039
Sort of. I mean, it shows that
she could be rehabilitated.

1062
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,959
Wait. Lissa does something
like that to herself?

1063
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,039
- Cuts and scars and...
- Yes.

1064
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,959
Christian, she really could have used
your support these past few weeks.

1065
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,039
You agreed Lissa
hasn't been herself.

1066
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,999
It's her fault we're not together.

1067
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,119
God, the female, especially one
who lives off of blood and magic,

1068
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,359
is going to have her mood swings.

1069
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:04,039
It is never the girl's fault,
even when it is the girl's fault.

1070
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,759
No one ever explained that to you?

1071
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,439
You know, if you weren't so psychotic,
you'd be fun to hang outwith.

1072
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,722
Same to you, creep.

1073
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,119
Thank you.

1074
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,679
OK, bye.

1075
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,609
- OK.
- See ya.

1076
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,879
What were you doing with Rose?
You were fornicating, weren't you?

1077
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,559
Fornicat... We were reading.

1078
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,999
We discovered a magic
called Spirit. You have it.

1079
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,199
Ms. Karp had it,
and so did St. Vladimir.

1080
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,079
- He used to cut himself, too.
- Rose told you that?

1081
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,439
- I'm gonna kill her.
- Look, stop it, Lissa.

1082
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,759
We're trying to help you.

1083
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,799
I know now if you don't
have any family,

1084
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,159
you need as many friends
as you possibly...

1085
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,603
I don't need friends or
family or pets or...

1086
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,879
I hate you!

1087
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,685
You liar.

1088
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,879
- Lissa, listen...
- Don't "Lissa, listen" me.

1089
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,639
- You've ruined my life.
- Oh, bite me.

1090
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,399
- You wish, blood whore.
- Wow.

1091
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,879
OK, Lissa, I need
you to understand.

1092
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,199
We can learn how St.
Vladimir used Spirit...

1093
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,759
- Did you kill my cat?
- Hey,

1094
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,839
Oscar and I's relationship
was on the mend.

1095
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,839
Lissa, this is important.
Ms. Karp turned herself Strigoi.

1096
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,079
She didn't do it to become evil.
She did it to take away from

1097
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,639
the scratching and
the shaking. I mean...

1098
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,919
which future do you want, a sick
and soulless one like Karp's

1099
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,439
or an epic one like Vladimir's?

1100
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,639
Stop talking to me about
the past and the future,

1101
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,639
because I only care
about the present.

1102
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,879
You know, if you have to choose one,
pick the one that's happening right now.

1103
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:34,119
I am Princess Vasilisa Dragomir.
I'm the last of the Dragomir line.

1104
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,039
If they see I'm weak,
they'll attack.

1105
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,759
This isn't about a "they" anymore.
This is about you! This is...

1106
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,959
You're awake, finally.

1107
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,639
The princess has been going
through feeders all morning.

1108
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,159
How are you?

1109
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,999
I don't know. You tell me.

1110
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,519
I'm afraid to even look.

1111
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,839
I can move it,
that's a good sign, right?

1112
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,963
Rose, I don't know how
to say this, but...

1113
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,279
you are not injured.

1114
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,319
That's easy for you
to say, comrade.

1115
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,091
I heard the crack.
I saw the bone...

1116
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,799
Sorry to interrupt.

1117
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,079
- Hey.
- Hi.

1118
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,930
- Here.
- Thanks.

1119
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,159
So, I saw Aaron go by.

1120
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,799
- I kicked him to the curb.
- Mmm.

1121
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,879
When I saw your leg, I got
everything out of my system.

1122
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,159
- Everything.
- Thanks for that, by the way.

1123
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,479
Ugh.

1124
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,959
I'm so glad you're both alive and
not at each other's throats.

1125
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,639
This whole matter of Spirit
has taken us by surprise.

1126
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,119
Until the advisers
arrive from Romania,

1127
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,439
we'll be sequestering
you both into a bunker,

1128
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,519
away from any excitement.

1129
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,759
No classes, and obviously
you will not be attending

1130
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:14,119
- the Equinox Dance tonight.
- Oh, nonsense.

1131
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,999
Please, you have to come.

1132
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,999
I'm gonna go with the headmistress
on this one, Prince Dashkov.

1133
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,359
Besides, we're all forgetting
the most important thing.

1134
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:26,799
- We have nothing to wear.
- There the gods have smiled upon us.

1135
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,799
Today is an overcast day,

1136
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,599
and I have engineered a
little shopping expedition.

1137
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,599
Please? You know how
much I need your help.

1138
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,371
And plus, when has shopping
ever not cheered you up, Lissa?

1139
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,519
Where is Rose?

1140
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,688
OK.

1141
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,279
What was that about?

1142
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:59,759
It's just a little something Dimitri and
I do to keep each other on our toes.

1143
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,639
Wow, that was weak. How long
have you been in crush with him?

1144
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,879
I am... very sure that I don't
know what you're talking about.

1145
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,719
- So, do I get a silver stake?
- That would be a... no.

1146
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,199
But remember, today you are
not just Lissa's friend.

1147
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,084
Spiridon.

1148
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,279
Ain't likely any Strigoi
is gonna make a play

1149
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,959
in a public place
in broad daylight,

1150
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,159
but if Dimitri ain't
giving you a stake, missy,

1151
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,159
you should have one
of these bad boys.

1152
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,439
'Causes a blinding flash of
UV light. Buy you some time.

1153
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,087
Well, at least someone
thinks I'm worth a weapon.

1154
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:45,039
So, my superpower turned out
to also be my Kryptonite.

1155
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:48,439
Wow, Your Highness with the
pop culture reference.

1156
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:51,319
You know, I...

1157
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,879
I confused power with popularity.

1158
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,328
Ever wonder what it'd be
like to be like that?

1159
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,799
It's not our destiny.

1160
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,519
Destiny? I hate that word.

1161
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,679
You know, "royal responsibility,"

1162
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:12,039
"the Moroi come first,"
it's all so twisted.

1163
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:15,999
It's not twisted. I'm your Dhampir
and you're my Moroi. Done.

1164
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,479
Some days we're kooky teenagers,

1165
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,439
and other days I'm risking
my neck to protect you

1166
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,999
from an ancient race of
predatory vampires...

1167
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,599
or whoever else, and that's life.

1168
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,239
At least until they come up
with a better word for it.

1169
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,999
Somebody looks tense. Free massage?

1170
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,159
I'm really sorry. I'm so sorry, OK?

1171
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,930
Run.

1172
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,079
Ms. Karp, I understand all that,
but Mia and my brother...

1173
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,999
don't think so.

1174
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,359
Andre was generous and
funny and amazing,

1175
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:52,799
but... he could kind
of be a player.

1176
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,119
Lissa, don't look like you don't
know what I'm talking about,

1177
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,799
'cause I can feel you, OK?

1178
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,839
You know, I hate having a
best friend I can't lie to.

1179
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:02,759
Do you really think
Mini-Mia's behind everything?

1180
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,999
No, not exactly.

1181
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,319
But I think we'll find out tonight.

1182
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:08,679
Tomorrow you're getting sequestered
away by Spirit advisers,

1183
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,479
so the dance is the last chance
for anybody to try to get to you.

1184
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:14,319
Look, if you could put a pin in all
that, we have more vital matters.

1185
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,919
Finding you a dress.

1186
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,599
I can go into my trust fund.

1187
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,719
I could not possibly accept that.

1188
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,199
That's your dress. That's the
dress you were born to wear.

1189
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,880
Lissa, we have more important
things to do than sh...

1190
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,239
That is my dress.

1191
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,439
Thank you, sir, and if you
could just sign here?

1192
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,039
And that is your necklace.

1193
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,890
That is my necklace.

1194
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,199
That's not your necklace.

1195
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,811
So not my necklace.

1196
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,999
Did you take my lip gloss?

1197
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,759
Corpse Number Five? Like I'd
wear your pale-ass lip gloss.

1198
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:43,919
No way.

1199
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,479
Natalie, you look gorgeous.

1200
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:51,607
Rose... this is for you,
from my father.

1201
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,919
That's my necklace.

1202
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,090
Daddy saw you looking at it. Here.

1203
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,439
- How does it look?
- Beautiful.

1204
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,119
All right, ladies.

1205
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,959
I don't know what's
gonna happen tonight.

1206
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:26,119
At this point, I can't remember
who loves us and who hates us...

1207
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:29,159
but I do know that we are
going to own this dance.

1208
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,044
Let's make tonight our bitch.

1209
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,439
Not much of a reaction
from your boyfriend.

1210
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,439
He's not my boyfriend, but...
grading on the Dimitri curve,

1211
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,479
a huge reaction...
mammoth, gargantuan.

1212
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,159
Come here.

1213
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,519
Genuinely un-small.

1214
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,085
Christian Ozera.

1215
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,119
At a school dance.

1216
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:22,039
After this week, I thought I'd
lost the ability to be surprised.

1217
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,439
I'm sorry about that
kiss the other day.

1218
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:27,199
What about the one right now?

1219
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,924
- Rose.
- Hey, what's up?

1220
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,399
- OK.
- Rose, you look...

1221
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,919
No, you don't get to stare at her.

1222
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,999
I took it upon myself to talk to
these royal pains in the butt.

1223
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,359
Hmm.

1224
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:59,919
Don't you have something to say?

1225
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,439
- We're sorry.
- Hmm.

1226
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,479
We didn't do anything to
you that we said we did.

1227
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,119
You're telling something that never
happened actually never happened?

1228
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,279
Thanks.

1229
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,119
Mia let us have sex with
her if we obeyed her.

1230
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:13,279
I tagged the note at the church
and air-blasted the memorial.

1231
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,999
What did you think of
the scary screen saver?

1232
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,879
We actually put a lot
of work into that.

1233
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,439
And the bloody one just happened.

1234
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:22,199
We thought it'd be fun to all
hook up in the princess's room,

1235
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,479
and things got out
of hand, literally.

1236
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:27,359
It's called blood splash.
It's a new Moroi fad,

1237
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:30,079
<i>where when things get hot and sticky,
you fang open your wrist and spray.</i>

1238
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,199
Ew! Stop. I nap on that couch.

1239
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,879
OK, what about the cat?

1240
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,159
We thought it was a fox.

1241
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,159
Hurting animals...
that's disgusting.

1242
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,839
Said the creepy blood splasher.

1243
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,610
Please, Rose, don't kick my ass.

1244
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,041
Go dance with Natalie.

1245
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,363
Go, now.

1246
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,886
Oh, Jesse.

1247
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:05,329
- Who's the man?
- You are so the man.

1248
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:12,845
Break the case wide open and
I still only get the cheek.

1249
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,039
Ouch.

1250
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,239
Ever feel like you're
being watched?

1251
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:18,879
Can we pretend the past
month never happened?

1252
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,039
Why were you in the hospital?
Pregnant?

1253
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,999
- I guess not.
- Herpes?

1254
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,919
Maybe your baby has herpes.
I don't care if it's true. I'll tell...

1255
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,919
- Go away, Mia.
- Why are you Dragomirs such drags?

1256
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,679
First Andre, then you steal Aaron
from me and don't even keep him.

1257
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,879
- I don't need this.
- I vow to take down the entire...

1258
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,279
I'll fire-magic you into ash.

1259
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:36,199
I'll just water-magic
myself before you can...

1260
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,599
Gosh, you two are a riot.
Allow me, Mr. Ozera.

1261
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,119
Rose, I hear you and the
princess are friends again.

1262
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,799
Too bad... could have
made a great team.

1263
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,239
Oh, nice wrist corsage, Splashy.

1264
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:48,559
Your sex slaves told me
everything, and poor Aaron

1265
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,919
had no idea what a
sociopath you really are.

1266
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:56,599
- I'll bet you did off Lissa's cat.
- Oscar? I gave him treats.

1267
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,479
I would never hurt a kitty.

1268
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,519
Oh, my God, you poor little...

1269
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,919
All this time, me thinking
that you're a villain

1270
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,159
when you're really just...

1271
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:08,999
you're just an insecure little girl
in desperate need of attention.

1272
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,599
Everyone saw that I tried to
take the high road there.

1273
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,679
- Rose.
- Sort of.

1274
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,839
If Mia didn't do it, that means there's
a bigger threat still out there.

1275
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,159
- Hathaway, you're out of here.
- Lissa's run off. I didn't see where.

1276
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,199
Oh, God, if only there was a secret place
that she went to when she was sad.

1277
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,289
- Right.
- Genius.

1278
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,439
OK, OK.

1279
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,051
OK.

1280
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,159
Please, please, please, please.

1281
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,399
- Christian.
- We need to get you somewhere safe.

1282
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,159
- Just a little longer in the moonlight.
- No, no.

1283
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,328
Our moonlight.

1284
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,599
OK, now we need to go.

1285
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,959
Lissa.

1286
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,839
Headmistress Kirova,
we need to get Dimitri.

1287
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,039
- The princess is in trouble.
- She's not the only one.

1288
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,439
- You don't understand.
- I do understand, Rose.

1289
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,759
I understand more
than you'll ever...

1290
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,239
I could have been a model.

1291
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:18,279
A man in Milan gave me
his card when I was 16.

1292
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,726
Dimitri? Dimitri, open up.

1293
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,519
Dimitri, something has happened.

1294
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,768
Rose, what's wrong?

1295
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,719
What's right?

1296
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,439
Sweet sassy molassey.

1297
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,239
What do you want, Rose?

1298
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,522
Some of that.

1299
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,366
This is insane.

1300
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,439
What are we doing?

1301
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,404
Everything.

1302
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,719
I love your dress.

1303
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,285
Let's burn it.

1304
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:30,119
Love charms... hypnotic,
dangerous, put over jewelry...

1305
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,527
Forget about it. Lissa's been
kidnapped. We have to hurry.

1306
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,999
Report from the gate.
Nothing's come in or out.

1307
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,359
They're still on academy ground...
Have you cleared this with Kirova?

1308
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,199
Better to beg forgiveness
than ask permission.

1309
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,687
Yeah, and I put a
sedative in her ass.

1310
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:51,639
Let me concentrate.
You've got to be kidding me.

1311
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:55,526
- What is it?
- Nothing. Hold on. OK.

1312
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,239
<i>He's coming in.</i>

1313
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:03,119
Check the blindfold.
No compulsion tonight.

1314
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,079
I can't make out anything
through the blindfold,

1315
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:09,199
but I know that voice.
It's... that guardian.

1316
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,079
<i>- Oh, no.
- "Oh, no," what?</i>

1317
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:14,599
"Oh, no," who. The bad
guy's Victor Dashkov.

1318
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,359
Welcome, Vasilisa.

1319
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,279
How was the dance?

1320
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,679
It's officially tomorrow,
and, as promised,

1321
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,239
we have much to talk about.

1322
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,519
Forgive me if I don't
make eye contact.

1323
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:28,199
- I've seen you in action.
- Why are you doing this?

1324
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:33,119
My dear, the simple truth is,
I need you to heal me.

1325
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,959
Testing you with the
animals was misguided,

1326
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,359
but earth-magicking the cement
and shattering Rose's ankle

1327
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,719
was supremely clarifying.

1328
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,839
You're forgetting something.

1329
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:47,519
My bond with Rose is
practically a psychic GPS.

1330
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,199
Ah, yes, but the necklace
gift that I gave to Rose

1331
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:55,199
is bathed in a very
expensive love charm,

1332
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:59,639
and she is a little too preoccupied
to be of much use to you.

1333
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:02,079
That's what you think, mother...
Victor wants her to heal him.

1334
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,839
You were my family's
most cherished friend.

1335
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,119
Why didn't you just ask me?

1336
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:11,959
How touching...
genuinely, my darling,

1337
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:14,999
but a chronic disease
like my Sandovsky's needs

1338
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,759
continual healings, and then
there is the other matter.

1339
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,479
The physical toll on me.

1340
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:26,439
Yes, Spirit users take their
power from their own essence.

1341
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:29,999
To heal another requires
giving part of oneself,

1342
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,319
and it can destroy one over time.

1343
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,439
You want me to give
up my life for yours.

1344
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,319
Basically. But, you see, my dear,

1345
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:40,319
I am much more important than you,

1346
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:45,759
and the Moroi need a strong
leader, but my disease means

1347
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,919
that I cannot occupy my
rightful place upon the throne.

1348
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:52,239
But you shouldn't bother
your pretty little head

1349
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,959
about all this royal intrigue.

1350
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,759
Guess what, Victor.

1351
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,319
The spirit in this pretty little
head isn't going to heal you.

1352
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:02,199
- You can't make me.
- Bring in Kenneth.

1353
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:04,119
Do you know somebody named Kenneth?

1354
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,399
Your compulsion won't
work on Kenneth.

1355
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:11,119
He's blind, but he's one of the
Moroi's most ingenious air users.

1356
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:14,319
- Shall we begin? Heal me.
- Go to hell.

1357
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,839
You're up, Kenneth.

1358
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:25,999
Rose?

1359
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,929
Don't stop. They're torturing her.

1360
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,767
Heal me.

1361
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,279
Now he's...

1362
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,679
Ah, Lissa.

1363
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,325
Heal me.

1364
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,607
My...

1365
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,729
this really worked out.

1366
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,321
Take the girl upstairs
till departure.

1367
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:45,359
Rose, stay here. It's too dangerous,
you'll just get in the way.

1368
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,079
- But...
- Do I really need to remind you

1369
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,279
the last time I said
"stay in the car"

1370
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:49,439
and was disobeyed?

1371
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,120
No, I totally understand.
Good luck.

1372
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,519
- You're not really staying, are you?
- What do you think?

1373
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,639
But what did Dimitri mean by
"last time I said 'stay in the car" '?

1374
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,479
He was talking about another
girl from another time.

1375
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,205
She was a novice.

1376
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,679
I'm a guardian.

1377
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,848
Let's roll, fire magic.
I need a seeing-eye dog.

1378
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,879
Take my arm.
The princess is upstairs.

1379
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,446
No, no, not this way.

1380
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,399
- Rose.
- Keep going.

1381
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,559
- It's right up there.
- Rose!

1382
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,921
What?!

1383
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,839
Spiridon, send for the girl.

1384
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,280
We're ready now.

1385
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:16,084
I believe you can fly.

1386
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,399
Feel free to chime in at any
time with some fire magic.

1387
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,639
Maybe a ring of flame
around the knob?

1388
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,959
I've never really worked outside
a classroom setting before.

1389
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,799
Forget it, she's gone.

1390
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,879
Stop trying to save yourself, Liss.

1391
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,206
Stupid one-way bond.

1392
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,159
Psi-bounds.

1393
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:13,679
Expensive to breed,
difficult to train,

1394
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:17,639
but there is no denying the
brilliance of the psi-hounds.

1395
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:20,799
They will stalk the
princess, maneuver her,

1396
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,599
but they won't attack
unless I say the word.

1397
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,519
I presume you can deal with that?

1398
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,959
They say Dimitri is a god.

1399
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,687
Well, I'm an atheist...
an atheist with a big gun.

1400
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,759
That's it? Seriously?

1401
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,519
I've waited for this moment.

1402
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:41,079
Do you know what it's like to always be
referred to as the second best guardian?

1403
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,359
No.

1404
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,124
Are you OK?

1405
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:52,839
- Did you see what Victor did?
- I know. What an asshole.

1406
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,919
I hate to interrupt, but unless
either of you can fly a chopper,

1407
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:56,679
maybe we should get going.

1408
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,919
Lissa, get back.

1409
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:02,519
Rose, be a dear and step
away from the princess.

1410
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:05,079
I don't want to accidentally
shoot her when I'm shooting you.

1411
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:07,039
You heard him, he won't shoot me.

1412
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,399
- I am your guardian.
- No, Rose, you can't do this.

1413
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:12,968
Lissa, don't you dare fight. Lissa.

1414
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,759
- You're worse than a Strigoi.
- Christian!

1415
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:21,799
Do you know what I like
most about the psi-hounds?

1416
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:25,599
They're wonderful at tracking.
They're even better at killing.

1417
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,199
Attack!

1418
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:31,679
No.

1419
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:52,526
Now, that's some
freaking fire magic.

1420
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,599
Rose, I need to save
him, but I can't.

1421
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,559
Victor took everything,
all my energy.

1422
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:01,285
Power up, Princess.

1423
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:36,159
<i>This has been a night that St.
Vladimir's will never forget.</i>

1424
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:39,959
<i>We have extra guardians manning the
academy perimeter. Nothing can get in.</i>

1425
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:43,439
Victor Dashkov will be confined
to a holding cell downstairs

1426
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:46,999
until he can be transferred to the
Royal Court Prison to await trial.

1427
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,199
How's Natalie? She worshipped her
father. She must be devastated.

1428
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:53,879
The other members of the Dashkov
family are removing her from school.

1429
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:55,599
For the best.

1430
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,319
Uh-oh, Rose. This came for you.

1431
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:01,519
Oh, great.

1432
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,919
Uh, Dimitri, one last thing...

1433
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:08,759
The time gap after Rose so
dramatically burst out of my office...

1434
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,439
It should all be explained
in the other file.

1435
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:13,879
A Nobu charm was put on a
necklace Rose had been wearing.

1436
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:17,159
The spell caused Rose to attack
me and me to attack her.

1437
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:21,999
I disengaged the necklace before
critical... violence could occur.

1438
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,043
Mmm.

1439
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,159
Hey, we should probably talk
about what happened earlier.

1440
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,999
I just want you to know I
would never use the words

1441
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,119
"sweet sassy molassey"
unless under the influence.

1442
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:34,399
It is not a matter of
amusement or discussion.

1443
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,399
- It was horrific.
- Horrific...

1444
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,319
isn't really the first
adjective that comes to mind.

1445
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,359
Don't make light of this.

1446
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,879
It's one thing if I were
36 and you were 28,

1447
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:46,839
or me 28 and you 20.

1448
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:49,959
That's a lot of math for
someone who's not interested.

1449
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:53,599
Your life is about
homework, dances, parties.

1450
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,039
How can you say that
after what happened?

1451
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,439
It's what it should be about.

1452
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,359
I'm not interested
in you in that way.

1453
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,279
- OK.
- It was...

1454
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,039
just a spell.

1455
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:03,439
- Let it go.
- Got it.

1456
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,599
- Rose?
- Yeah?

1457
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,759
You're still here?

1458
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,359
I'm not sure how I feel about this,

1459
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,239
but Victor has requested
a moment of your time.

1460
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:11,359
Yeah, no, that's not gonna happen.

1461
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:14,040
He said something about you
being "shadow-kissed"?

1462
01:25:14,041 --> 01:25:17,039
She's not going. That's final.

1463
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,049
Don't tell me what to do.

1464
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,199
You look good, Vic.

1465
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:37,599
Which is ironic, considering it
means more time rotting in jail.

1466
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,759
Don't take this the
wrong way, Rose, but...

1467
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,279
I probably should have killed you.

1468
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:44,439
There's a compliment
in there somewhere.

1469
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,919
I spent a lot of
money on that charm.

1470
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,599
It didn't quite work
out the way I wanted.

1471
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,079
Mmm. It worked out well enough.

1472
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:54,119
Caused a man with no interest in
me to burn off my dress, so...

1473
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:57,359
You're so tough, so one-of-a-kind.

1474
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,159
But you're still a girl.
All this has happened,

1475
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:04,039
and what you want to know is,
"Does Dimitri really like me?"

1476
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,199
It's a powerful charm, Rose,
but it's not that powerful.

1477
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:13,009
There has to be a degree of affection
and attraction already in place.

1478
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:14,999
Happy?

1479
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,759
- Shadow-kissed?
- Ah, yes. I owe you that.

1480
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,079
You see, I didn't begin
to track Vasilisa

1481
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,399
with some silly old raven.

1482
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,284
My eye was on her long before.

1483
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:26,849
<i>I've seen the accident report.</i>

1484
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:31,639
<i>And there's absolutely no way that
either of you should have survived.</i>

1485
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:35,119
<i>The accident was what woke
her spirit in the first place.</i>

1486
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:38,679
<i>The fear of seeing you
dead made it burst out,</i>

1487
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:42,282
<i>allowing her to heal,
made you form your bond.</i>

1488
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:44,439
Rose...

1489
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:46,563
you've been kissed by shadows.

1490
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:49,599
You've crossed over into death,

1491
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:54,079
into the other side, and returned.

1492
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,839
Don't you think that leaves a
mark on the soul... somewhere?

1493
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,519
That's why you're not afraid
to show your feelings, Rose,

1494
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:03,839
your passion, your anger.

1495
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,964
That's what makes
you remarkable. Yes.

1496
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:11,719
But it's ironic... considering.

1497
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:13,039
Considering what?

1498
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,319
Considering I'll have to kill you.

1499
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:23,399
Natalie. You made your own
daughter turn Strigoi?

1500
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,559
And how do you think I can
circumvent the outside security?

1501
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:27,959
I'd do anything for my daddy.

1502
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:38,319
All that training, and yet,
I'm going to obliterate you.

1503
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,479
You see, Natalie was not the
innocent you thought she was.

1504
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:43,919
In fact, she was the one who
provided me with the intel

1505
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,639
regarding you,
Dimitri and Vasilisa.

1506
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:48,639
The cat was my idea.

1507
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,879
Daddy wanted to do another fox.

1508
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,199
Father, look.

1509
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,079
Rose does choke before Strigoi.

1510
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,999
I don't understand.

1511
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,399
To become a Strigoi,
don't you have to...

1512
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:02,599
Yes. I chose Ray to be my first.

1513
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,679
<i>Killing him was a lot more fun</i>

1514
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,999
<i>than losing my virginity
to him would've been.</i>

1515
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,919
And with a lot more blood.

1516
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,399
Too soon?

1517
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,519
Hey, Victor?

1518
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,599
Aren't you afraid your
new Strigoi daughter

1519
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,719
won't be able to resist
your Moroi veins?

1520
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:34,127
Don't be ludicrous.

1521
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,919
I'm gonna wait outside, Natalie.

1522
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,326
Finish her off.

1523
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,726
You don't know what high school
is like for a loser like me.

1524
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,450
I was so scared all the time...

1525
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:51,479
so weak, so sad, so lame.

1526
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:54,399
Now my eyesight is perfect,

1527
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:58,119
my skin is clear,
and so is my mind.

1528
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:01,599
I may be dead, but I have
never felt so alive.

1529
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,439
How awesome for you. Say cheese.

1530
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,039
Rose?

1531
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,599
Oh.

1532
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:30,199
Maybe I won't kill you.

1533
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,799
Maybe I'll make you just like me.

1534
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:37,359
That way, we can be
friends forever and ever.

1535
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,847
BFF!

1536
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,040
Who's choking now?

1537
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,399
Roza, Roza.

1538
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,489
Oh, my Roza.

1539
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:38,719
Lissa, you're gonna
want to see this.

1540
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:41,759
I don't believe my eyes. You got him
wearing a color other than black.

1541
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,359
Baby steps.

1542
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:44,599
Oh, Rose, wait.

1543
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:46,519
There's so much to read here.

1544
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,559
Apparently, Vladimir and Anna
almost drowned in this flood,

1545
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,919
but he saved them from certain
death, and listen to this.

1546
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:55,519
"It took many years for Vladimir to
master the power of his Spirit."

1547
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,439
"Despite his sufferings
and delusions,"

1548
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,039
"he never contemplated
the way of the Strigoi,"

1549
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:02,239
"because he always
had the strength"

1550
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:05,319
"of his shadow-kissed guardian,
Anna, to see him through."

1551
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:08,399
Similarities. Weird.

1552
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,159
Well, Christian, for us, weird...

1553
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:12,727
Doesn't begin to cover it.

1554
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:15,559
Do I have to?

1555
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:16,921
It's time.

1556
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,250
God, not her. Not now.

1557
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:30,159
And once again, this grotesque
maelstrom of indecency

1558
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:33,479
seems centered on one
royal individual.

1559
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:35,399
- Where's Vasilisa Drag...
- Thank you, Your Majesty,

1560
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,879
for allowing me to clear the air.

1561
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:41,039
I finally declared a magic,
and it's called Spirit.

1562
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,559
It may take years to
get a handle on it,

1563
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:46,159
but I have a bunch of wise
men in robes to help me out.

1564
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:49,559
And yes, that was not a mirage
you saw on the dance floor.

1565
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:53,399
My boyfriend is Christian Ozera,
and his parents were Strigoi.

1566
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,399
Get over it. He has.

1567
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:56,679
I'm not quite sure
what you think...

1568
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,559
Shh! Not now, dear.

1569
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,879
Blood. Blood is what
connects us all.

1570
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:05,719
Blood is sustenance.

1571
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:08,279
Blood is family.

1572
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:13,439
Blood is pain, and blood is death,

1573
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,599
be it the fang of the Strigoi

1574
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:20,010
or a drunk driver on the
wrong side of the road.

1575
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:21,959
Blood is many things,

1576
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:25,439
and sometimes it gets
so crazy and confusing

1577
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:28,679
that you need a best friend
to tell you, "it's OK."

1578
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:33,599
"It's all life, at least until they come
up with a better word for it."

1579
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:36,319
Unfortunately, you can't
all have a Rose Hathaway.

1580
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:39,999
I'm very lucky that she's mine,

1581
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,439
but if you don't have a soul mate,
by Vlad, the least you deserve

1582
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:48,599
is kindness and dignity and something
more original than gossip,

1583
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:51,999
snobbiness, slut-shaming
and bullying.

1584
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,479
Let's prove that Moroi
blood is worth protecting.

1585
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:58,159
What do you say, everyone?

1586
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:00,279
No more bad blood.

1587
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:20,239
So, that's Natalie, huh?

1588
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:22,559
Looks... fresh.

1589
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,199
I'm sorry.

1590
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,519
I had to.

1591
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:26,679
I'm sorry.

1592
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:29,039
- I hesitated.
- Rose...

1593
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,879
you're so brave and
strong and bold.

1594
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:35,926
Sadly, you'll have many other
opportunities to kill Strigoi.

1595
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:40,446
You lied about your
feelings for me.

1596
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:45,129
Yes. I did.

1597
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,639
Why would you do that?

1598
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:51,759
It's more than my age and
my position at the academy.

1599
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:54,079
Our allegiance is to the Moroi.

1600
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,039
If I let myself love,

1601
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:58,891
I wouldn't throw myself
in front of the princess.

1602
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,362
I would throw myself
in front of you.

1603
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:11,079
It's funny.

1604
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:13,559
Your reasons for not
loving me just...

1605
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:16,411
make me love you more.

1606
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:24,407
I want you to kiss me without a
magic charm forcing you to do it.

1607
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:26,559
That's not a great idea.

1608
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,285
Please.

1609
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:31,488
Everyone's at the banquet. Just...

1610
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,969
one last kiss.

1611
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:41,039
Yes! Yes, yes!

1612
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:44,359
Yes! Are you not entertained?!

1613
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,159
<i>My name is Rose Hathaway,</i>

1614
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,679
<i>and I'm not your
normal teenage girl,</i>

1615
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:04,119
<i>but I guess, is there
really such a thing?</i>

1616
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:08,239
<i>Every life has rules, traditions,
friends and enemies,</i>

1617
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:10,359
<i>sheer terror and incredible joy,</i>

1618
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:11,799
<i>but I've learned...</i>

1619
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:14,606
Whoa! Watch where you're
going there, bird.

1620
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,679
Are you kidding me?

1621
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:20,239
It's you, isn't it?

1622
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:22,399
Come...

1623
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,119
my shadow-kissed soul mate.

1624
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,639
Well, same to you, buddy!

1625
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:49,491
Now!

1626
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:52,090
Soon.
