1
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,589
Mom?

2
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,748
Mommy?

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,877
Mommy!

4
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,355
Are you okay?

5
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,710
No. I'm scared.

6
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,279
It's just thunder, sweetie.

7
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,550
I know. I'm scared of thunder.

8
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,757
Can I sleep with you tonight?

9
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,355
You're almost six, Billy.

10
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,554
I think it's really important that you
learn to sleep in your own bed.

11
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,716
Even when it's thunder and lightning?

12
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,712
Even when it's thunder and lightning.

13
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,115
But mom...

14
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,315
But what?

15
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,711
They come for me when it's dark.

16
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,640
Honey, nobody's coming for you.

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,555
Except maybe
me if you don't go to sleep.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,955
Okay?

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,031
Okay. Check first?

20
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,035
Yes sir.

21
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,235
Do you want to look?

22
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,712
Daddy and I are right downstairs.

23
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,909
If you pull the covers
over your head,

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,229
you're safe, right?

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,589
Right.

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,354
Okay.

27
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,192
I'll leave the door open a crack, okay?

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,755
Okay.

29
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,115
Mom?

30
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,555
Mommy?

31
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,795
Mommy!

32
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,594
<i>It's mom. I'm not going to</i>
<i>make my Friday visit, but honey...</i>

33
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,715
What else is new?

34
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,429
<i>You got to keep up</i>
<i>with those pills.</i>

35
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,635
Yes mother.

36
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,633
<i>Julia, hi, Doctor Crowley.</i>

37
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,070
<i>The thirteenth's fine</i>
<i>for your thesis defense.</i>

38
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,429
<i>Say nine a.m.</i>

39
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,199
<i>I'll let Professor Essex know.</i>

40
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,556
<i>Please confirm as soon as you can.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>

41
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,951
<i>Jules, take off the bike shorts and</i>
<i>listen to me...</i>

42
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,032
<i>The ambulance threw a rod</i>
<i>so I’m switching shifts</i>

43
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,559
<i>and I got the night off,</i>
<i>are you free?</i>

44
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,309
<i>Julia, it's Kim.</i>

45
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,711
<i>Join us here in</i>
<i>the 21st century, huh, get e-mail.</i>

46
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,074
I hate e-mail.

47
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,229
<i>Think of it as an actual</i> "<i>date</i>".

48
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,355
<i>Foreign concept, I know,</i>

49
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,590
<i>but a break just</i>
<i>might free your fevered mind.</i>

50
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,872
I can't go out tonight,
I have to study.

51
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,516
<i>And don’t say</i> "<i>I can’t go</i>
<i>out tonight, I have to study.</i>"

52
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,915
<i>I’m picking you up at eight.</i>

53
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,113
<i>You’ve done a year of research.</i>

54
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,309
Presented your thesis...

55
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,199
So all that's left's the defense, right?

56
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,192
Hmm hmm. Then I've got my Masters.

57
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,916
Great.
Then you can psychoanalyze me.

58
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,039
Well, I can do that now.

59
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,676
C'mon, give me credit
for being a little mysterious.

60
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,595
Raised by puritanical
Midwestern parents,

61
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,878
you are hardworking,

62
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,319
honest to a fault,

63
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,234
and very, very empathetic.

64
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,429
Okay, my turn.

65
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,949
Raised by an overbearing mother,

66
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,759
you're passionate,
driven, maybe to a fault,

67
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,309
and just a little bit moody.

68
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,795
Moody?

69
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,428
The highs are high, the lows are low.

70
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,275
It means you feel.

71
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,717
That's a good thing. Trust me.
That's why we're good together.

72
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,915
Body and soul.

73
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,389
Playing a good game of pool is a sign
of being well-rounded, you know.

74
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,916
Says who?
- Some dead English guy.

75
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,596
What do you want me to say?
I'm feeling it.

76
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,469
Let's see if you "feel it"
when something's riding on it.

77
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,871
Twenty's yours if you sink it.
- Alright.

78
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,989
No pressure.

79
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,755
Oh.

80
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,553
One more time.
Double or nothing.

81
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,598
Driven to a fault, remember?
- It's your money.

82
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,271
Alright. Here we go.

83
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,510
<i>... steadfast</i>
<i>in their stance on the issue.</i>

84
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,990
<i>Earlier this week</i>
<i>civic government announced...</i>

85
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,111
Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

86
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,829
Uh... sorry we're home.

87
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,349
We were just - actually - uh...

88
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,355
Reese kind of flaked on us
so we decided to be domestic.

89
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,118
<i>... power crises intensify,</i>

90
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,399
<i>the specter of rolling blackouts</i>
<i>goes from threat to reality.</i>

91
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,950
Speaking of,
you guys pay the electric bill?

92
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,673
<i>Tragedy struck</i>
<i>a downtown warehouse today...</i>

93
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,668
Well, Paul, you see there isn't...
- Come on.

94
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,030
You know what?
We were thinking, like,

95
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,158
why should we pay for something
we're not even going to get, right?

96
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,358
You got fired again.

97
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,555
Yeah.

98
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,234
So you don't mind
fronting us again, right?

99
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,669
Just, like, until I get back on my
feet, man, I swear to God...

100
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,711
It won't be long.

101
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,916
Anyone comes
in my room, they're dead.

102
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,996
You got it, man, you got it.

103
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,879
That's what I'm talking about...
- It's not my fault.

104
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,795
Alone at last.

105
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,471
You gonna get that?
- I have to... it could be Crowley.

106
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,837
On a Friday night?
- I paged him.

107
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,832
Hello?

108
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,230
Billy. Hey.

109
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,870
What's wrong?

110
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,272
I can't leave right now.

111
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,276
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
I could see you tomorrow.

112
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,514
Um... okay.
I'll come and meet you.

113
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,155
Hmm hmm.

114
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,354
I'll be there in a half hour.

115
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,437
Okay. Bye.

116
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,359
What now?
- He didn't say.

117
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,473
But he sounded terrible.
- He always sounds terrible.

118
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,991
The guy's permanently freaked out.
- You know the shit he's been through.

119
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,875
Yeah, well, who hasn't?

120
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,270
Look, I know you guys are close,
and I'm cool with that,

121
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,956
even if you have known him
since you were, like, five.

122
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,475
But you can only expect so
much understanding from one mortal.

123
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,958
But you're not just any mortal.

124
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,748
I won't be long.

125
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,748
Julia?

126
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,075
Billy?

127
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,315
My god, I almost didn't recognize you.

128
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,796
What's wrong?
- I look bad, huh?

129
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,556
Terrible.
What happened to your hand?

130
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,796
It's... it's hard to explain.
- Try.

131
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,032
They're here!
- Who?

132
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,118
Billy, it's just
a power surge from the storm.

133
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,755
No, it's not.

134
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,075
Listen to me...

135
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,270
You remember those night terrors
that we used to have?

136
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,189
What, when we were kids?

137
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,830
That's when they marked us.
And now they're back.

138
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,315
Who?

139
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,430
You see that?
- What?

140
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,357
Listen to me: When you hear a baby
crying, or you hear a kid crying

141
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,910
you keep moving, okay? Children
can sense them. It's your warning.

142
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,873
Warning against what?
- Also, they affect the electrical things.

143
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,596
They affect the lights and the
phones. They... they affect things.

144
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,354
Billy, stop!!
You're not making sense.

145
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,360
Just tell me what happened.
- What I am telling you.

146
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,995
They can't be in the light.

147
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,958
They hide in the
dark so you can't see them.

148
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,276
I mean I've been
doing research, and reading

149
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,958
and... I don't think I'm alone.
Poe... I think he saw them too.

150
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,636
His writing's dark, and hopeless.
And he went crazy too.

151
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,671
I don't know
what you're talking about.

152
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,999
Well of course you don't. I have
to work nights so I can sleep days!

153
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,228
My own fucking mother has to look
at me like I should be locked up.

154
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,871
I even tried to find out if there's other
people like us.

155
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,952
I made friends,
to see if it wasn't just me.

156
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,235
And you know what I found out?

157
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,954
What?
- Nobody can help me.

158
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,150
I'm going to help you.
- No! You can't.

159
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,475
I shouldn't have called you.

160
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,355
No, you did the right thing.
Just try to explain it to me.

161
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,355
I'm scared.

162
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,318
I'm scared.

163
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,757
There's nothing to be scared of.
- You're wrong.

164
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,195
Billy.

165
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,430
I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

166
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,635
No...

167
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,349
Hello?

168
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,793
Hello?

169
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,595
Hello?

170
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,515
Paul?

171
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,675
Paul?!

172
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,195
Paul?

173
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,395
Paul?

174
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,753
Julia?! Julia!

175
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,515
Julia... Stop!

176
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,189
JULIA!!!

177
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,635
Julia! Stop!

178
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,991
Hey, listen, I'm not going to hurt you!
I'm going to stay right here.

179
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,831
Honey, listen. Hey...
hey... there's nothing to be afraid of.

180
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,353
How did I get here?
- You must have been sleepwalking.

181
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,316
It's nice to see
someone else born after 1950.

182
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,154
Hey.

183
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,919
So, how did you know Billy?
- We were friends since we were kids.

184
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,915
I'm Julia.

185
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,835
Right... yeah... um...
Billy talked a lot about you.

186
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,155
Um... I'm Sam,
this... this is my roommate...

187
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,679
Terry. Hi.
- Hi.

188
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,071
Billy, Sam and I
were really close in college.

189
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,235
Yeah.

190
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,998
You were with him, weren't you?

191
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,996
The night that he...
- Yeah.

192
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,434
I'm sorry.

193
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,634
Did he say anything to you?

194
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,669
Nothing I could understand.
It was all pretty incoherent.

195
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,914
Sort of like
maybe he was on something again.

196
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,191
You know he was taking Prozac.

197
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,588
I guess it didn't work.

198
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,799
Excuse me.

199
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,234
What?

200
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,949
Hey...

201
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,198
I just wanted to apologize for
Sam's comment back there.

202
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,352
The guy engages his mouth
before his brain sometimes.

203
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,037
It's okay. I'm just a little
over-sensitive right now.

204
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,998
We all are.

205
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,112
So, had you
seen much of Billy recently?

206
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,954
Yeah, until he moved
back here about 3 months ago.

207
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,800
Do you know what he
was trying to tell us with all this?

208
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,713
Maybe he was planning
for a really long camping trip.

209
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,671
Or that he was afraid of the dark.
- I know that feeling.

210
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,716
You had night terrors as a kid, right?

211
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,397
Did Billy tell you that?

212
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,872
Yeah. For a while
that was all he could talk about.

213
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,309
In fact, it is the reason
that him and Sam and I met.

214
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,159
We all had 'em.
- What?

215
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,593
It's crazy, huh?

216
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,231
See, we all got
really close freshman year,

217
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,512
but it was only later that Billy
told us he had sought us out.

218
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,150
He was obsessed back then.
- And what about lately?

219
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,755
He'd come to me,
recently, a few times,

220
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,196
babbling about how
we shared the same problem,

221
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,072
how we need to stay in the light.

222
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,160
I guess I should've
taken him more seriously,

223
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,754
but I was so used
to Billy acting crazy, you know?

224
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,712
It never occurred to me that
the same thing could happen to us.

225
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,719
<i>You are the string days collected</i>
<i>like tiny silk beads</i>

226
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,115
<i>and counted before sleeping.</i>

227
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,155
Julia!

228
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,673
Hey, baby... Welcome home...

229
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,836
Are you drunk?
- I prefer intoxicated.

230
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,760
Come on,
I'm just having a couple of drinks.

231
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,435
What's with all the hostility?

232
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,914
I had an accident.
- What?

233
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,914
On the way home. I had an accident.
- Are you hurt?

234
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,195
No.

235
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,836
Okay. Tell me what happened.

236
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,874
I was driving out
in the middle of nowhere and...

237
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,718
I thought something
ran out in front of me,

238
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,912
so I had to slam on the brakes and
I nearly went off the road.

239
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,835
Did you hit the 'something'?

240
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,755
I don't know.

241
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,119
I don't think so.

242
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,515
I thought I saw what...

243
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,918
I'm just not...
exactly sure what happened.

244
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,432
Okay, well, was it an animal?

245
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,993
I don't think so.
- Okay, so what'd you hit, an alien?

246
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,590
I should have known...
I should have known!

247
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,715
Oh, hey...

248
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,711
No, I should have known that
you would make fun of me.

249
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,912
Well, what do you want me to say!!
- I don't know.

250
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,633
I just know
that something scared me.

251
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,798
I've got my
defense the day after tomorrow.

252
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,594
I just don't need to come home and
find you getting wasted

253
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,119
with your idiot roommates!!

254
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,553
Look, let me
tell you what I've been up to.

255
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,914
There was a thirteen car pile-up
on the 80 last night.

256
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,518
So for the past 24 hours I've been
cutting dead people out of their cars.

257
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,952
There's a difference between what
you've been through

258
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,434
and what I've been through.

259
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,669
Yours is in there...

260
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,549
Mine's out here.

261
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,676
Don't get
confused about which is which.

262
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,358
Billy must have been writing
in this diary since childhood,

263
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,831
so we thought you
might want to take a look at it.

264
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,312
Maybe you can make more
sense out of it than we could.

265
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,276
It's pretty deranged stuff.

266
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,435
Like this:

267
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,755
"Saw them again,
beneath my window, in the alley."

268
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,556
"Always in darkness and shadow."

269
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,355
"Where do they come from?"

270
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,672
"Could it be that darkness
is their way in and out?"

271
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,314
"Origins. Incubus,
bringers of nightmares."

272
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,072
"Grendels lurking in the darkness,"

273
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,314
"can only assume
that light is my savior..."

274
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,429
"Maybe it's all in my head."

275
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,672
"The insane nightmare of a schizo."

276
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,796
You don't seem
surprised by any of this.

277
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,553
It's a lot like the stuff he talked
about the night he died.

278
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,558
It's not too surprising that
he would write about it too.

279
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,996
No, I guess not. It's just that...

280
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,794
We were wondering if...

281
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,235
What?

282
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,829
If you've had any
recent 'night terrors'?

283
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,592
Yeah, actually, I have.

284
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,833
Us, too.

285
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,110
Ever since Billy killed himself,
I've had this uneasy feeling.

286
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,390
You know, like
I'm being watched or something.

287
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,712
I mean, I'm 24 years
old, and I walk in a dark room

288
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,192
and it's like I'm 5 again...

289
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,719
C'mon, you guys.

290
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,549
We've all been through an
extremely traumatic experience.

291
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,120
It's only natural that
certain uncomfortable feelings

292
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,435
would be stirred up...

293
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,628
You don't remember.

294
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,909
Remember what?

295
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,313
How powerful those feelings were.
- What do you mean?

296
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,155
When I was five,

297
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,759
I watched my sister drown in a lake
where we used to spend our summers.

298
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,033
Right after, I started to suffer
from terrible night terrors.

299
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,231
There was one particularly bad night.

300
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,398
I woke up screaming my head off.

301
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,552
My parents finally
managed to get me to sleep,

302
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,917
and a couple of hours later, my
mother came back to check on me

303
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,554
and I was gone.

304
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,278
They looked everywhere:

305
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,631
In the attic. In the basement.
All over the house.

306
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,509
My mother was hysterical,

307
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,150
she thought I'd been kidnapped,
or I'd run off, or who knows what.

308
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,831
Then my father
went into the backyard

309
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,196
and he heard a noise in
the doghouse, of all places.

310
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,235
He stooped down, looked in,
and there I was, huddled in the back.

311
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,839
Naturally, he reached in. And...

312
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,352
that's when I stabbed him in the eye
with a kitchen knife.

313
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,871
I was convinced
he wasn't my father.

314
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,393
That he was some
kind of demon coming for me.

315
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,390
I was absolutely sure of it.

316
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,874
I haven't had that
feeling since I was a kid,

317
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,268
but I have it now...
and so does Sam, and...

318
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,389
we thought you might, too.

319
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,275
Julia?

320
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,711
Yes, Dr. Booth.
- I hardly recognize you!

321
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,710
In fact, I don't recognize you at all,
but come on in.

322
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,956
It's hard to think of you
as that frightened little girl

323
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,832
who used to come in here.

324
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,871
My god, it's been what...

325
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,275
Twenty years.

326
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,432
Twenty years.
It's a wonder I'm still around.

327
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,515
So, what have
you been doing with yourself?

328
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,992
Well actually, I'm going
for my masters in psychology.

329
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,834
Psychology?! That's wonderful!

330
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,436
Now, tell me, outside of studying,
how are you doing?

331
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,149
I'm not doing that well, Dr. Booth.
That's why I came to see you.

332
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,752
I haven't been sleeping that well...
I think I had a recurrence.

333
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,918
A recurrence? Of what?
- Night terrors.

334
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,755
What makes you say that?

335
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,753
A few nights ago, I woke up
in my bathroom... totally disoriented.

336
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,279
My boyfriend came to
help me and I attacked him.

337
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,275
Well, it certainly
sounds like a night terror.

338
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,272
It's not unheard of in adults...

339
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,311
But really quite abnormal.

340
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,515
Yes, that's right.

341
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,108
Night terrors can be part
of normal childhood development.

342
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,791
But I've found that the most violent
and persistent cases

343
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,112
occur in children who've suffered
profound emotional trauma.

344
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,116
If I recall, you
came to see me shortly after

345
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,073
your father took his
own life, isn't that right?

346
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,635
Yes.

347
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,470
So, your recent night terror
could possibly have been triggered

348
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,910
by an increase in stress or fatigue.

349
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,749
Am I far off?

350
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,076
No. No.

351
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,959
Julia, why don't we schedule
a formal session.

352
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,873
I don't usually treat adults,
but since we have a history,

353
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,471
you could come in here, describe
the things you're going through,

354
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,116
and we'll try to figure out
if it really is a recurrence

355
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,313
of night terrors
or if it's... something else.

356
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,308
You scared the hell out of me.

357
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,591
Sorry...

358
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,352
What do you think went through
Billy's mind when he did it?

359
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,474
The bullet.

360
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,870
I don't know, Terry, the same thing
that goes through everybody's mind

361
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,911
before they kill themselves:

362
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,395
That they hate their life;

363
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,277
they're better off dead than alive.
Blam! Blam! Blam!

364
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,119
I wonder what it's
like to get to that place.

365
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,119
Terry, stop picking it
or it's never going to heal, okay?

366
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,149
It's not healing anyway. I might
as well get some satisfaction.

367
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,591
I think it's getting worse.
- Maybe it's cancer.

368
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,072
There is something seriously demented
about you, do you know that?

369
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,678
You know, maybe
I should've gone to law school.

370
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,680
Like I said... demented.

371
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,598
Look, I'm going to go out,
try to detox for a little bit.

372
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,839
Are you going
to be alright by yourself?

373
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,915
Yeah.

374
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,149
Sure?

375
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,474
Yeah.

376
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,797
Okay. Bye.

377
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,275
Got you!

378
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,313
Damn rats.

379
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,198
Understanding your Child's Dreams

380
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,514
Hello?
<i>- Hey, Julia. How goes it?</i>

381
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,552
Lousy.
I'm still on chapter four in Crowley,

382
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,676
and I can't remember half the other
sources in my bibliography.

383
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,755
<i>Well, look at the bright side.</i>

384
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,071
If you flunk, it's only another 12
months of hell and another 20 grand.

385
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,395
<i>But it could be worse.</i>
- How?

386
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,069
<i>I’m not sure exactly.</i>

387
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:06,033
Hey, listen Kim, will you call me later?
Make sure I'm still awake.

388
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,029
<i>Okay, bye.</i>
- Thanks. Bye.

STATE MENTAL

Could somebody turn
the lights back on, please?

393
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,759
Hello?

394
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,034
Open the door!

395
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,750
Please, somebody help me!!

396
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,239
Damn it!

397
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,678
Moore's Theory of Discordance
postulates that subjects,

398
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,430
when presented with evidence
hostile to their world view,

399
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,551
experience
disassociative discordance

400
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,792
or fight or flight reflexivity.

401
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,120
And discordance here is defined...

402
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:09,470
as... delusions of reality stemming
from childhood trauma

403
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,269
and... a heightened
state of anxiety...

404
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,039
Yes. Sorry.

405
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,991
By increasing the number of
familiar external stimuli

406
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,469
individuals will...

407
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,434
...well, individuals will try...

408
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:33,148
...individuals experiencing
discordance will...

409
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,756
Would you please excuse me?
- Yeah. Certainly.

410
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,273
<i>Hey, it's Julia.</i>
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

411
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,311
<i>Julia, come on,</i>
<i>pick up. I know you’re there.</i>

412
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,710
<i>I’m sorry about the other night.</i>

413
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,751
<i>So consider this the official apology.</i>

414
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,873
<i>Besides, I want to</i>
<i>hear how your defense went.</i>

415
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,270
<i>I bet you knocked</i>
'<i>em dead, but I need specifics,</i>

416
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,474
<i>so pick up the phone.</i>

417
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,554
<i>Alright, I can take a hint.</i>

418
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,600
<i>But I’m gonna harass you</i>
<i>until you call me back.</i>

419
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,196
<i>Hey, it's Julia.</i>
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

420
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,395
Paul...

421
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,355
Hello?

422
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,875
<i>Julia. This is Sam.</i>

423
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,754
Oh, hi.

424
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,151
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

425
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,399
<i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, it's Julia.

426
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,639
<i>Yeah, come on in.</i>

427
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,715
Okay.

428
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,988
Hello?

429
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:20,915
Sam?

430
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,273
Depressing, isn't it?

431
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,274
Look, I'm sorry that I called you.

432
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,519
I just figured that you'd be the
only one that would understand.

433
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,278
Understand what?
- I mean, you see it, right?

434
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,874
I don't know what I see.
- But you can feel it.

435
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,157
You definitely feel that
something bad is happening, right?

436
00:53:58,840 --> 00:53:59,795
Yes.

437
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,192
You see, you do understand.

438
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,875
Terry's missing.

439
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,589
What do you mean, 'missing'?

440
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,512
She didn't come home last night.

441
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,952
The rec center
called me this morning.

442
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,469
And they said that they found her
bag with all of her stuff in it.

443
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,552
Sam, slow down. Maybe...

444
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,830
Maybe she just
forgot her stuff in her locker.

445
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,877
And what, left the
building in her bathing suit?

446
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,995
Did you call the police?

447
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,115
Yes, I did.

448
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,468
They're not going to find anything.

449
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,232
I've been studying Billy's diary
ever since we found it.

450
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,868
You know, I can't seem to do much
of anything else. It's like...

451
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:34,955
Sam...

452
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,075
No, wait, wait. Just listen.

453
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,879
Okay, now I can't make
sense of all of it, but...

454
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,355
I was taken to their world when I was
five and marked, but it faded.

455
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,229
They only mark kids
who have night terrors.

456
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,235
Listen to this...

457
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,552
"Last week the mark reappeared."

458
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,872
"It means they're coming for me."

459
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,630
Just listen to his last entry, okay?

460
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,878
"I can't write much longer,"

461
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,676
"the mark on my hand
keeps getting worse."

462
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,674
"I can't stand it."

463
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,878
"I pulled out
this thing they planted in me."

464
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,952
Sam, Billy was unstable,
we know that.

465
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,115
No...

466
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,788
This is ridiculous...
he'd had problems since he was a kid.

467
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,869
We all did.

468
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,871
Now, don't you think it's possible...
that something that scared us as kids

469
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,070
has come back... to collect us?

470
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,475
What are you saying?

471
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,476
I never saw Billy's mark,
but I did see Terry's...

472
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,990
and hers looked a lot like this...

473
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,909
Hi.

474
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,435
Hi.

475
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,635
What's your name?

476
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,868
Sarah.

477
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,239
My name is Julia.

478
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,275
Are you all by yourself?

479
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,475
Where's your mom?

480
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,469
Heaven.

481
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,549
Do you work here?

482
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,795
No.

483
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,435
I don't either.

484
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,675
I'm a patient.

485
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,033
Sarah... do you have bad dreams?

486
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,679
Sometimes.

487
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,993
What happens in your dreams?

488
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,079
They come for me.

489
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,069
Who comes?

490
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,753
They.

491
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,719
Why do they come for you?

492
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,279
To eat me.

493
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,595
Does anything keep them away?

494
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,473
Lights.

495
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,673
You think I'm crazy?

496
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:07,955
No.

497
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,270
Why don't you tell me what
you think it all might mean.

498
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,750
Our night terrors may not have been
induced by emotional trauma at all.

499
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,516
Maybe something really did
come for us when we were kids,

500
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,193
and planted something in us.

501
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,315
And whatever it was, it left a mark.

502
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,671
Just like that little girl's.
- And now they're coming back?

503
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:30,469
Yes! And that's why the marks
reappear. So that they can find us

504
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,953
and take us back to the place in
our night terrors... out of the light.

505
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,278
I know how it sounds.

506
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:42,274
Julia, you say you failed your thesis
defense with Dr. Crowley?

507
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,150
Perhaps you'd like to tackle this case?

508
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,273
Subject is suffering
post-traumatic stress

509
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,392
from witnessing the
suicide of a close friend.

510
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:06,990
Influenced by the erratic behavior
of two strangers,

511
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,556
she allows herself to entertain...

512
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:15,439
the paranoid schizophrenic delusions
of her dead friend.

513
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,551
And why does she do that?

514
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:23,389
Because she feels
a sense of personal failure...

515
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,875
...and guilt that Billy...

516
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,235
...that her friend died.

517
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,076
And you are going to be
an excellent psychologist.

518
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,639
I'll see you on Thursday.

519
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,319
Thank you, Dr. Booth.

520
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,878
Oh, Julia...

521
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:59,478
If these demons were coming back,
wouldn't you have the mark too?

522
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,159
Remind me what I'm looking for?

523
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,031
Like an infected mark-thing.

524
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,117
Little, pinkish. Like the size of a dime.

525
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,837
Well... nothing yet.

526
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,356
But it's early.
- Paul, this is serious...

527
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,070
Okay. I'm sorry. You're all done.

528
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,278
No marks.

529
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:21,795
You sure?

530
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,149
Double-checked, trust me.

531
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:29,194
Not that I'm complaining, you know,
but why'd you need me to do that?

532
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,719
I met these two friends
of Billy's at the funeral.

533
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,114
And?

534
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,715
Well, they both had marks like Billy's.

535
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,671
And so I went to tell Dr. Booth, and...

536
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,269
Oh, you're just
gonna think this is crazy.

537
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:54,076
Julia. Didn't we just search
your entire body and find nothing?

538
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,791
So, what have
you got to worry about?

539
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,833
You're right.

540
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,155
You're right.

541
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,239
Jesus!

542
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,873
Somebody!

543
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,800
Hey! Over here! Help!

544
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,318
Hey! Over here!

545
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,835
Come on!

546
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,673
Hey, Paulie! We're
going down to the...

547
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,837
Woah. Hello, nurse.
- Get out! Get out!

548
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:20,795
You mad?
- Not mad. I'm embarrassed.

549
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,679
But I'll get over it.

550
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,799
Troy may not, however.

551
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,036
I'm sorry about
the last couple of days.

552
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,717
Hey, you feel. Don't apologize for it.

553
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,870
Good night.

554
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:41,955
I'll see you tomorrow.

555
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,959
<i>... and all for less than a dollar.</i>

556
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,274
<i>What do you think of that?</i>

557
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,109
<i>You can’t beat that kind of value.</i>

558
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,396
<i>... as the power shortage</i>
<i>reaches critical levels,</i>

559
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,114
<i>residents are asked to save</i>

569
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,592

<i>On the lighter side</i>

571
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:08,709
Paul!

572
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,113
Paul!

573
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,753
Paul!

574
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,148
Let me in!

575
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,355
I'm coming!

576
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,475
My God, what happened to you?

577
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:26,709
Julia, what happened?

578
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:27,875
Look at me.

579
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:28,995
Let me see you.

580
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,111
Look at me. Look!

581
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,435
Look!!

582
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,635
I've got it!

583
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,951
Just like Billy and Sam...

584
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,354
I've got this thing on me...

585
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:38,629
Jesus, how the
hell did you manage that?

586
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,796
Ouch!! Be careful! It hurts...

587
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,109
Don't move. Don't move.

588
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,959
There was... There was this thing...

589
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,795
like a... like a big splinter,

590
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,355
and I pulled it out of me...

591
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:49,794
...I pulled it out of me...

592
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:50,875
You pulled what out of you?

593
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:54,550
It was in my head.
This thing was in my head!

594
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,119
Slow down. Slow down.
What was in your head?

595
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,432
I don't know... like a kind of a bone...
or something...

596
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,350
I don't know...
they grabbed me in my apartment.

597
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,790
In my apartment, they tried to get me...

598
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,952
I ran down the street and I...

599
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,952
...I was in this bathroom and...

600
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,957
Because of the light.

601
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,798
It has something to do with the light.

602
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,558
I think that they can't be in the light.

603
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,713
Billy wrote it all down...

604
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:18,795
Drink this.

605
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:23,995
...and electricity!!

606
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,714
Which is why the
whole blackout thing...

607
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,156
They could be everywhere...
- Sit.

608
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,509
No... everywhere.
- Sit down.

609
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,993
Okay, take a few deep breaths, okay.

610
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,719
You'll be asleep soon.
- Asleep?!!

611
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:34,989
I'm not going to go to sleep!

612
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,075
Honey, you need to go to sleep.

613
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,549
Okay?

614
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,754
I can't go to sleep!

615
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:40,955
What did you give me??!!

616
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,549
Don't touch me! Get away from me!

617
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,552
Listen to me! Nothing's
going to happen to you.

618
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,278
I will not let anything happen to you.

619
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,153
I won't let anything happen to you.

620
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,351
Now, sit down. Sit down.

621
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,393
I'm going to get you
some clean clothes,

622
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,153
and then I'm going to take
care of everything... okay?

623
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,109
Alright?

624
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,673
Alright.

625
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,871
Everything you're feeling is
perfectly understandable

626
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,798
considering the week you've had!

627
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,036
The best thing you can do is
just stay here and get some rest.

628
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,752
No!

629
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,199
No! Let me out!

630
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,032
Somebody!

631
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,831
Wait! No!

632
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,839
No!

633
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,031
Stop!

634
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,519
Stop!

635
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,915
No!

636
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,031
Help!

637
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:41,275
Hey!

638
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:59,273
This really isn't like her.
She's just confused.

639
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,751
All we can do is to wait,
see what happens. Make sure that...

640
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:06,949
Julia!

641
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,353
It's okay. It's okay, Julia.

642
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,158
It's okay. You're safe now.

643
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,828
You're safe.

644
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,550
Did you think
something was attacking you?

645
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,389
They found you in the subway...
- With a concussion.

646
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,595
You're pretty banged up.
Let's get you back into bed.

647
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,872
I was trying to get to the red light...

648
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:34,517
Okay, we'll work all that out.
But right now you need to rest.

649
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,474
Everything's going to be fine.

650
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,675
How could she
get out of a locked room?

651
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,472
That door was bolted.

652
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,033
Julia?

653
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,155
What is it?

654
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:49,788
Nothing.

655
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:52,833
Nothing.

656
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,435
Help!

657
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,635
Help me! I'm here!

658
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:58,949
Help me!

659
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,552
I'd better go call security.

660
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:06,756
Help me! Hey! I'm here!

661
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:09,839
Help!

662
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,558
Are you coming?

663
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,039
Wait! I'm here!

664
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,554
Nooo! I'm here!

665
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:27,550
I'm here!

666
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:31,390
No!
