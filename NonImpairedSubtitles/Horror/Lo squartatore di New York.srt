I'm Lieutenant Williams.

a bit like a-

00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:40,553
What I mean to say is
that in real life she was
much prettier- a real doll.

41
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,805
Poor thing. She was
murdered, wasn't she?

42
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,017
I'll ask the questions,
if you don't mind,
Mrs. Weissberger.

43
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:50,313
Uh, when did you last
see this girl, um, Ann Linn?
That was her name, right?

44
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,900
No. That's her working name-
her "nomay" de "plumee" or whatever.

45
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,862
Good gracious. If I was as beautiful
as she was, I wouldn't mind
people knowing my real name.

46
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:02,116
She was a model, you know.
Exotic poses and so on. Um-

47
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,744
She had it all.
She was destined for the big time.

48
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,663
Well, I won't bend your ear
any more, Lieutenant,

49
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:11,918

was, um, last Friday.

I remember that because
I had just turned on Dallas.

53
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,846
You know, that TV series
about that family that has money...

Well, it was just 7:00,

56
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,943
and she got this telephone call
from this, um, person.

57
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:40,112
Strangest voice I ever heard.
Sort of like a duck.

58
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,118
- Like a duck?
- Quack, quack, quack.
Just like that.

59
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,789
Not that he said
"quack, quack, quack,"
but that was the tone.

60
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,458
And he made an appointment
to meet her.

61
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,044
Yeah, huh?

62
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,380
How come you heard the phone call?

63
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,049
Well, um,
my phone's on the blink,

64
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,134
and sometimes it rings
together with Ann's.

65
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,553
So I answer, of course,
and happen to listen in.

66
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,223
Not that I pry. God forbid.

we'll call, okay?

Sam.

- Well, well, well.

If it isn't the big
chief person himself.

166
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:38,150
Hello, Fred. Listen, Fred.
I want a word with you,
and it's kind of hush-hush.

167
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,820
Uh, is there, uh,
someplace we could talk
without being disturbed?

168
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:44,781
Sure. How about the church
across the street?

169
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,783
[Sighs]

170
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,454
Fred. Fred. Have you
flipped out, or are you
trying to give me an ulcer?

171
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,082
A smart-ass coroner comes out,
what with a little verbal diarrhea,

172
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,127
and you immediately
go around declaring
there's a maniac loose in the city.

173
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:01,924
Yeah? So, what would you rather I say?
A Boy Scout's been starting to
whittle on little girls with his knife?

174
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,885
For Christ's sake, don't get me wrong.
I don't want to cramp your style.

175
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,387
But could you use a little discretion
when you say things?

176
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,182
Papers follow up on this,
it might start a panic, you know.

177
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,392
You don't wanna create
another Atlanta, do ya?

178
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,394
Try and see it my way, Fred.

179
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,480
Yeah. All right, all right.

180
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,483
Hmm. Well, let's hope
this was just an isolated case.

181
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,070
Tell me, uh, why did you
exclude the car owner?

182
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:26,698
Do you expect a serious answer
to your question, or do you
wanna hear a funny story?

183
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,826
You think that nerd
who, when he found her,
went to bawl in a men's room...

184
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:33,163
could have ripped a girl's
guts out on a crowded ferry?
Calm down a minute, Fred.

185
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,791
At what point are you
in the case?

186
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,585
Well, I sent some of
the murderer's blood
down to the boys at the lab.

187
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,796
Ah.
They put it through
the hemo sniffer.

188
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,174
The answer they came up with
is it could be any one
of a million people.

189
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,219
Hmm.
What we do know is that
he's, uh, between-

190
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:52,057
Maybe. Maybe he's between
28 and, uh, 30, and he's lived
all his life in New York.

191
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:56,061
Hmm. And do you have
a plan of action?

192
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,522
Huh?
No, I do not know
what I'm gonna do.

193
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:04,319
Maybe- Maybe I'll go to a shrink
and get a psychological profile
on this nut.

194
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,948
It may narrow the field a bit,
and, uh, I may get a clue.

195
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,367
Yeah. I'm sure
that's probably a good idea.

196
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,369
The important thing
though, Fred,

197
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:16,164
is that New Yorkers believe
we have the situation
firmly under control,

198
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,501
that the metropolitan force
is an example of
perfect efficiency.

199
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,587
Got it?
Mm-hmm.

Hey. Somebody
called for ya.

202
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:32,723
Yeah? Who?
Guy with a strange voice.
He said he'd call back.

I want to talk to Dr. Davis.

How unimaginative
you policemen can be.

223
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:18,370
It's about that maniac who loves to
slash young girls to death, right?

224
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,874
How did you guess that?

on the case, don't you?

228
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,929
Yeah. More or less.
I figure if I'm up
against a maniac,

229
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,765
I might as well have
some, uh, expert help.

One: He's quite good at, uh,
concealing his real personality,

389
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,639
which means total self-control.

He wants to provoke you.
And, uh,

392
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,733
that's probably got
something to do with his motives.

to nail Mikis Kalenda in court...

is that tape of his bout
with Jane Foster Lodge.

Professor,
could you sign this?
Yeah.

01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,366
It was his fourth victim,
right?

01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:51,368
Yeah.

796
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:53,370
But look at
this Kalenda character.

797
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:57,374
He's a guy who lives just for sex,
a 42nd Street gigolo.

The phone calls,
on the other hand-

799
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:05,007
Yeah, the phone calls indicate
a very intelligent personality...

family background.

All the rest is malarkey shit,
just for experts like you, not me. Okay?
