1
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:41,445
<i>(man) The child is dead.</i>

2
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:47,411
<i>He breathed just for a moment.
Then he breathed no more.</i>

3
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:51,484
<i>The child is dead. Dead. The child is dead.</i>

4
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:18,763
I'm afraid it will kill her.

5
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:21,649
My God, she wanted a baby so much.

6
00:02:22,611 --> 00:02:25,000
For such a long time.

7
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:38,159
What can I tell her? What... will I say?

8
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:48,409
You could adopt a child.

9
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:57,245
She wanted her own.

10
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:38,125
If I may suggest,...

11
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:40,600
...it even resembles...

12
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:47,125
Your wife need never know.

13
00:03:48,931 --> 00:03:51,525
It would be a blessing to her...

14
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:55,200
...and to the child.

15
00:04:03,171 --> 00:04:06,083
Are there no relatives?

16
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:08,162
None.

17
00:04:11,571 --> 00:04:14,369
The mother died, as your own child,...

18
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:18,800
...in the same moment.

19
00:04:21,891 --> 00:04:24,644
You said it could be ours, but...

20
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:28,007
On this night, Mr Thorn,...

21
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:30,685
...God has given you a son.

22
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:10,450
Oh.

23
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:12,522
Here's your boy.

24
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:54,921
- <i>Buongiorno.</i>
- Good morning. <i>Come va?</i>

25
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:57,002
<i>Bene.</i>

26
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:10,810
- What are you doing home so early?
- Just came to start packing.

27
00:06:10,891 --> 00:06:11,687
What?

28
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:15,844
We can't waste any time. We're leaving
in the morning. <i>Buongiorno, Carlo.</i>

29
00:06:15,931 --> 00:06:18,206
Please, Carlo.

30
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,486
What are you talking about?

31
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:25,440
I am talking about London. I am talking about
the ambassador to the Court of St James.

32
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:29,444
- Well, what about him?
- You're married to him.

33
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:32,250
I'm what?

34
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:37,359
It's me. I'm appointed
ambassador to Great Britain.

35
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:14,446
I've already told them yes.
I loved it the minute I saw it.

36
00:07:14,531 --> 00:07:16,522
Well, it's a bit much.

37
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:22,607
Well, nothing's too much for the wife
of the future president of the United States.

38
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:24,921
You know, you're pushy.

39
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,400
Come on. Wait till you see this.

40
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:32,639
Now, this... they call his day room.

41
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:34,722
His day room.

42
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,488
- So? How do you like it so far?
- Oh...

43
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:46,691
- Well, it needs some books. To warm it up.
- Couple of books. Warm it up. Yeah.

44
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:17,602
Mm.

45
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:24,087
- Something in mind, Mr Ambassador?
- Why don't we have a little look upstairs?

46
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:28,084
Well, there's no furniture up there, either.

47
00:08:33,571 --> 00:08:37,280
You know, you could be
too sexy for the White House.

48
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:09,843
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I won't be long.

49
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:12,240
We don't have that much to talk about.

50
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:16,210
Since when did two old college roommates
not have much to talk about?

51
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:20,443
Since one of them assumed
the awesome burden of the presidency.

52
00:09:20,531 --> 00:09:24,729
- Well, give my regards to the first lady.
- I'll do my best.

53
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,762
Why don't you change you mind,
fly over with me?

54
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:32,526
No, I'd better stay here
and fool around with Damien.

55
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:38,249
- Where is he?
- He was right behind us...

56
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:41,122
Damien?

57
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,282
- Damien?
- Damien?

58
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,043
Damien!

59
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:49,402
Damien!

60
00:09:50,411 --> 00:09:51,969
Damien!

61
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:53,962
Oh, my God, Robert.

62
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,690
Damien! Robert, where could he be?

63
00:09:56,771 --> 00:09:58,887
Damien!

64
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:08,126
You little monkey!
Don't you ever do that again.

65
00:10:09,611 --> 00:10:11,602
There you are.

66
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:28,084
<i>(# "Happy Birthday To You")</i>

67
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:33,805

- Just saving a bit for his canonisation.

73
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:56,403
- How's that?
- He's either the heir to the Thorn millions...

74
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:59,528
- ...or Jesus Christ himself.
- Want a bite, Daddy?

75

A big birthday smile.

One... two... three...

Let me jump on it, Daddy. Let me jump on it.

82
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,282
Hold on!

Damien, look at me!

00:12:31,731 --> 00:12:33,881
I'm over here!

87
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:37,281
- Damien, I love you.
- Look. There's Nanny.

88
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:41,484
Look at me, Damien. It's all for you!

89
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,330
Oh, my God!

90
00:13:03,891 --> 00:13:05,529
Go, Tom.

91
00:14:14,691 --> 00:14:17,888
- Morning. Have you read the papers today?
- No, I haven't.

92
00:14:17,971 --> 00:14:21,122
There was an article on the suicide,
your nanny that jumped.

93
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:24,806
- They say that she left a suicide note, sir.
- Not true.

94
00:14:24,891 --> 00:14:27,644
Mr Ambassador,
did you know she was on drugs?

95
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:30,165
Would you mind?

96
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:33,323
- Mr Thorn, did she use drugs?
- Not that I know of.

97
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:37,245
- The article said...
- I don't care what the article said.

98
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:42,007
I'm sorry.

99
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:46,403
I am sorry.
Will you send me a bill for the damage?

100
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:52,167
No, that's all right, Mr Ambassador.
Let's just say you owe me.

101
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:54,242
Corporal.

102
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:56,762
OK, outside.

103
00:15:02,731 --> 00:15:04,926
<i>- (buzzer)</i>
- Yes?

104
00:15:05,011 --> 00:15:07,684
<i>- There's a Father Brennan here to see you.</i>
- Who?

105
00:15:07,771 --> 00:15:10,080
<i>A priest named Father Brennan from Rome.</i>

106
00:15:10,171 --> 00:15:13,641
<i>He says it's a matter of
urgent personal business.</i>

107
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:16,803
- Never heard of him.
<i>- He says he just needs a minute.</i>

108
00:15:16,891 --> 00:15:20,884
<i>- Something about a hospital.</i>
- Donation time.

109
00:15:21,491 --> 00:15:25,643
- All right, send him in.
- I didn't know you were such a soft touch.

110
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:29,041
On that trip to Saudi Arabia,
why isn't it the right time?

111
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:33,762
Well, it's personal, Tom. I just, uh...
don't feel like leaving home right now.

112
00:15:46,451 --> 00:15:48,442
Yes, Father?

113
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:54,248
We haven't much time.
You must listen to what I have to say.

114
00:15:55,651 --> 00:15:57,721
All right. What is it?

115
00:15:57,811 --> 00:16:02,282
You must accept Christ as your saviour.
You must accept him now.

116
00:16:04,211 --> 00:16:09,843
Forgive me, but didn't I understand that you
have a matter of urgent personal business?

117
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:14,925
You must take Communion.
Drink the blood of Christ and eat his flesh.

118
00:16:15,011 --> 00:16:17,923
Only if he is within you
can you defeat the son of the devil.

119
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:21,481
- I see.
- He's killed once. He'll kill again.

120
00:16:21,571 --> 00:16:24,131
He'll kill until everything that's yours is his.

121
00:16:24,211 --> 00:16:27,886
- Father, would you mind...
- Only through Christ can you fight him.

122
00:16:27,971 --> 00:16:30,166
Accept the Lord Jesus.

123
00:16:30,251 --> 00:16:32,640
Drink his blood.

124
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:36,323
I've locked the door, Mr Thorn.

125
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:40,290
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Would you send for a security guard?

126

I beg you, Mr Thorn.
Listen to what I have to say.

<i>Ambassador Thorn?</i>

128
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:50,681
I was at the hospital, Mr Thorn,
the night your son was born.

129
00:16:51,371 --> 00:16:54,408
- I witnessed the birth.
<i>- Sir?</i>

All right. Stand by.

132
00:17:08,411 --> 00:17:11,642
- What do you want?
- To save you, Mr Thorn.

133
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,325
So Christ will forgive me.

134
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:19,924
What do you know about my son?

135
00:17:20,011 --> 00:17:23,162
- Everything.
- And what is that?

136
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,723
I saw its mother.

137
00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:31,086
- You saw my wife.
- I saw its mother.

138
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:33,969
- You're referring to my wife!
- Its mother, Mr Thorn.

139

This is blackmail! Come out and say it.
What are you trying to say?

140
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:40,085
His mother was a ja...

141
00:17:40,651 --> 00:17:43,723
- Everything OK?
- You sounded strange. The door was locked.

142
00:17:43,811 --> 00:17:47,929
- I want this gentleman escorted out of here.
- OK, let's go.

143
00:17:49,131 --> 00:17:52,009
Accept Christ each day.

144
00:17:52,091 --> 00:17:54,082
Drink his blood.

145
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:39,650
- Just get him off the grounds.
- All right, Father. Come on.

146
00:18:44,811 --> 00:18:46,802
Father.

147
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,282

that some of our young nannies,...

159
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:23,086
...they get homesick,
or they have boyfriend problems.

160
00:20:24,131 --> 00:20:27,726
I left all that behind a long time ago.

161
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:31,440
Well, now, if you'll let me see your boy?

162
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:36,642
Yes, of course. He's upstairs.
I'll show you where it is.

163
00:20:36,731 --> 00:20:41,759
Why don't you just leave us alone at first?
Let us get acquainted in our own way.

164
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:46,049
- Well, he's shy with new people.
- Oh, no. Not with me, he won't be.

165
00:20:48,171 --> 00:20:51,083
- Well, I don't think...
- I think it'll be fine.

166
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:53,765
Go on. Give it a try.

167
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,287
All right, then.

168
00:20:57,371 --> 00:20:59,839
- Mrs Horton.
- This way, Mrs Baylock.

169
00:20:59,931 --> 00:21:01,922
Excuse me.

170
00:21:09,211 --> 00:21:11,566
- I like her.
- She seems all right.

171
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:13,642
Where'd you find her?

172
00:21:14,571 --> 00:21:16,562
- Where did I find her?
- Yeah.

173
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:20,007
I didn't find her. I assumed you found her.

174
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:26,321
Round that corner to the right
and it's the door facing you.

175
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:30,370
- I'll have your things sent up in a moment.
- Thank you.

176
00:21:32,331 --> 00:21:35,607
- Oh, Mrs Baylock.
- Yes, ma'am?

177
00:21:35,691 --> 00:21:39,320
I'm sorry, but, uh... we're a little bit confused.

178
00:21:39,411 --> 00:21:41,402
Oh? Why's that?

179
00:21:41,491 --> 00:21:45,723
- Well, we don't know how you got here.
- Oh. The, er... the agency.

180
00:21:46,691 --> 00:21:51,207
- The agency?
- Well, yes. They read in the paper about the...

181
00:21:52,651 --> 00:21:56,405
...well, about your first nanny,
so they sent you another.

182
00:21:57,331 --> 00:22:00,482
- Oh, that's it.
- I'll call to confirm that.

183
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:03,240
Oh, erm...

184
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:06,846
- Here are my references.
- Thank you very much.

185
00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:12,881
Well, if... if I could see your boy... now?

186
00:22:13,171 --> 00:22:15,560
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

187
00:22:38,371 --> 00:22:40,407
Have no fear, little one.

188
00:22:43,091 --> 00:22:45,480
I am here to protect thee.

189
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:02,481
- In a minute, Horton, I think.
- Very good, sir.

190
00:23:07,891 --> 00:23:10,883
- Kathy!
- I'm coming! Mrs Baylock.

191
00:23:14,051 --> 00:23:16,121
- Mrs Baylock!
- Yes, ma'am?

192
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:18,486
- Where's Damien?
- If you don't mind,...

193
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:20,880
...I think he'd rather go to the park.

194
00:23:20,971 --> 00:23:24,600
- The park? I told you he was going with us.
- He's too young for church.

195
00:23:24,691 --> 00:23:28,047
- He'll cause a fuss.
- You don't seem to understand.

196
00:23:28,131 --> 00:23:32,363
It is my wish and my husband's wish
that Damien accompanies us to church.

197
00:23:32,451 --> 00:23:35,363
- Kathy!
- I'll be there in a minute!

198
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:38,807
Now, please have him dressed at once.

199
00:23:38,891 --> 00:23:42,247
Well, excuse me
for speaking my mind, ma'am,...

200
00:23:42,331 --> 00:23:44,799
...but do you really think a five-year-old...

201
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:49,726
...will understand the goings-on
of an Episcopal wedding?

202
00:23:49,811 --> 00:23:55,249
Will you have my son dressed and in the car
in five minutes? Thank you very much.

203
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:52,885
What's the matter, Damien?

204
00:24:54,891 --> 00:24:57,849
Oh, it's just a church, that's all.

205
00:24:58,891 --> 00:25:01,280
What's the matter?

206
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:04,202
- Robert.
- Something wrong?

207
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:08,330
- I don't know. He just seems scared to death.
- Is he ill?

208
00:25:09,811 --> 00:25:12,371
No, he's just...

209
00:25:12,451 --> 00:25:15,124
No, he's just trembling all over.

210
00:25:35,731 --> 00:25:38,928
- Mr Ambassador. Welcome, sir.
- Good morning.

211
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,725
- No!
- Damien!

212
00:25:47,331 --> 00:25:50,050
- Damien!
- <i>(Robert)</i> Damien, stop it!

213
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:53,485
Damien, stop it. Damien.

214
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:55,527
No!

215
00:25:55,851 --> 00:25:57,842
Horton, drive on.

216
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:16,526
Are you sure that
you don't wanna call a doctor?

217
00:26:16,611 --> 00:26:20,240
No, it's just a couple of bruises.
It'll be all right in the morning.

218
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:22,925
No, I mean... for Damien.

219
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:28,529
Oh, no, he's fine. He's... he's sound asleep.

220
00:26:28,611 --> 00:26:31,603
Just... just to have him examine him.

221
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:37,323
Well, he's perfectly all right.
Never been sick a day in his life.

222
00:26:37,411 --> 00:26:42,201
He never has, has he?
Isn't that a little strange?

223
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:45,648
Is it?

224
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:49,007
I mean, no measles or mumps or chickenpox.

225
00:26:49,091 --> 00:26:52,322
- Not even a cough or a cold.
- So?

226
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:57,649
I just think it's a little unusual.

227
00:26:58,611 --> 00:27:01,444
Look, he's a perfectly healthy boy.

228
00:27:02,091 --> 00:27:07,961
I mean, we have nothing to worry about
with him. Not physically or... or otherwise.

229
00:27:12,371 --> 00:27:16,000
He just... had a bad moment.

230
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:19,360
You know, like a fright.

231
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:29,650
<i>(knocking)</i>

232
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,006
Yes?

233
00:27:32,091 --> 00:27:37,006
- I'm leavin' now. Is there anything else?
- Nothing, thank you. Good night.

234
00:27:37,731 --> 00:27:42,759
I think the best thing to do with a bad day
like this is end it. I'm gonna go to bed.

235
00:27:42,851 --> 00:27:45,160
I'll be along soon.

236

<i>(growling)</i>

237
00:28:20,451 --> 00:28:24,364
Quiet, now. This is the master of the house.

238
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:26,123
- What is this?
- Sir?

239
00:28:26,211 --> 00:28:28,441
The dog.

240
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:33,605
- Beautiful, isn't he? We found him outside.
- Who gave you permission to bring it in?

241
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:37,929
I thought we could use a good watchdog, sir.
And Damien loves him.

242
00:28:40,171 --> 00:28:42,765
Gave you a fright, did he, sir?

243
00:28:43,691 --> 00:28:46,444
- Yes.
- Well, you see how good he is.

244
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:52,083
As a watchdog, I mean. I think you'll be
grateful on your long trips away, sir.

245
00:28:56,771 --> 00:29:01,049
Mrs Baylock, we don't need a dog,...

246
00:29:01,131 --> 00:29:03,964
...and if we do, I'll pick him out myself.

247
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:10,006
- Damien's taken quite a fancy to him, sir.
- Tomorrow morning you'll call the RSPCA,...

248
00:29:10,091 --> 00:29:14,403
...tell them to collect the dog
and find him another home.

249
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:16,482
You understand?

250
00:29:17,731 --> 00:29:19,722
Sir.

251
00:29:22,171 --> 00:29:24,241

You're so... silent this evening.

Just tired, I guess. Sorry.

- Yeah.

- Yes.

Robert? We're beautiful people, aren't we?

I need to see a psychiatrist. I... I have... fears.

I have such fears.

278

What kind of fears? What kind?

00:38:35,891 --> 00:38:38,724
There, see the old man Bugenhagen.

311
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:43,407
- He alone can say how the child must die.
- Look here...

312
00:38:43,491 --> 00:38:45,880
"He who will not be saved by the lamb
will be torn by the beast!"

313
00:38:45,971 --> 00:38:47,882
Will you stop?

314
00:38:54,051 --> 00:38:58,522
I'm here because you said
my wife is in danger.

315
00:39:00,491 --> 00:39:02,846
She is pregnant.

316
00:39:02,931 --> 00:39:08,051
- You're mistaken. That's nonsense.
- He will not allow the child to be born.

317
00:39:08,131 --> 00:39:11,965
- He will kill it while it slumbers in the womb.
- What are you talking about?

318
00:39:12,051 --> 00:39:14,326
Your son, Mr Thorn.

319
00:39:14,411 --> 00:39:16,800
The son of the devil.

320
00:39:17,451 --> 00:39:21,444
He will kill the unborn child,
then he will kill your wife,...

321
00:39:22,731 --> 00:39:27,805
...and when he is certain to inherit all that
is yours, then, Mr Thorn, he will kill you.

322
00:39:27,891 --> 00:39:28,926
That's enough!

323
00:39:29,011 --> 00:39:32,481
With your power, he will establish
his counterfeit kingdom here,...

324
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:35,244
...receiving his power directly from Satan!

325
00:39:36,331 --> 00:39:39,209
- You're insane.
- He must die, Mr Thorn!

326
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:42,522
You asked for five minutes,
and you've got five minutes.

327
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:47,162
Go to the city of Megiddo.
See Bugenhagen before it's too late.

328
00:39:48,891 --> 00:39:50,882
Now, I've heard you.

329
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,644
I want you to hear me.

330
00:39:53,731 --> 00:39:56,643
I never want to see you again.

331
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:02,683
You'll see me in hell, Mr Thorn.

332
00:40:03,491 --> 00:40:06,528
There will we share out our sentence.

333
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:46,486
No!

It's not all that bad.

- Hold my hands.

Yes, ma'am?

Would you just get him out of here, please?

Yes, ma'am.

what's the matter with me. I just...

I just don't seem to be able to...

00:44:05,651 --> 00:44:08,040
I don't know.

350
00:44:21,731 --> 00:44:23,722
Kathy, I love you.

351
00:44:24,571 --> 00:44:27,961
If this is what the doctor's doing to you,...

352
00:44:28,051 --> 00:44:31,361
...don't you think it's time
I had a talk with him?

353
00:44:31,451 --> 00:44:33,442
Yes, you should.

354
00:44:34,251 --> 00:44:37,243
There's something
he wants to talk to you about, anyway.

355
00:44:37,331 --> 00:44:39,322
Oh?

356
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:44,204
Robert, I... I don't ever
want to have any more children.

357
00:44:50,011 --> 00:44:52,002
All right.

358
00:44:54,611 --> 00:44:57,284
Then you'll agree to an abortion?

359
00:45:00,171 --> 00:45:03,846
I'm pregnant, Robert.
I just found out this morning.

Yes, this is he.

366
00:45:36,771 --> 00:45:38,762
Hello?

367
00:45:42,931 --> 00:45:45,604
Something about the newspapers.

368
00:45:59,891 --> 00:46:02,530
Well, she knew how much you wanted one.

369
00:46:02,611 --> 00:46:08,163
Now she can't cope. She searches for reasons
that won't make her feel inadequate.

370
00:46:08,251 --> 00:46:10,765
She has these fantasies.

371
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:16,369
She fantasises that your child is alien
and that your child is evil.

372
00:46:16,451 --> 00:46:19,045
She thinks that the child is evil?

373
00:46:19,131 --> 00:46:23,409
The point is, at this time,
another child would be disastrous.

374
00:46:25,851 --> 00:46:28,126
Well, in what way... evil?

375
00:46:28,211 --> 00:46:32,762
Now, this is just fantasy.
She also thinks the child isn't hers.

376
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:50,601
The most important thing for you to do
is to agree to an abortion.

377
00:46:50,691 --> 00:46:52,682
No!

378
00:46:54,331 --> 00:46:56,925
I'd like to know your reason.

379
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:06,407
It was foretold that
this pregnancy would be terminated.

380
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:09,483
I'm going to fight to see that it's not.

381
00:47:16,571 --> 00:47:18,846
- Forgive me, Doctor.
- Please don't leave.

382
00:47:18,931 --> 00:47:21,320
I'm sorry. I must get home.

- Yes. Doctor?

Is she... all right?

394
00:50:10,531 --> 00:50:12,761
Well, she will recover.

395
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:15,809
She's in there. Bed by the window.

396
00:50:21,171 --> 00:50:24,322
She has a concussion
and a broken humerus,...

397
00:50:24,411 --> 00:50:27,528
...and... well, some internal bleeding.

398

- Internal bleeding?
- Yes.

399
00:50:36,131 --> 00:50:38,599
But she's pregnant.

400
00:50:38,691 --> 00:50:40,124
No.

401
00:50:42,411 --> 00:50:45,209
- She's lost it?
- Afraid so.

402
00:50:52,371 --> 00:50:57,889
You know, you've got a lot to be grateful for.
She's still alive.

403
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:01,884
And, with proper care,
she can still have children.

419
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:33,001
The photographer
whose camera got smashed.

420
00:54:33,091 --> 00:54:35,764
Would it be possible
to have a word with you at my flat?

421

- If it's about the camera...
- No, it's not about the camera.

It's about you, Mr Thorn.

423
00:54:43,451 --> 00:54:46,124
- And the death of the priest.
<i>- Oh?</i>

424
00:54:48,371 --> 00:54:49,690
Go on.

425
00:54:55,531 --> 00:54:57,647
Do you notice anything unusual?

426
00:55:00,011 --> 00:55:01,524
No. Sorry.

427
00:55:02,531 --> 00:55:06,240
At first I thought
this was just a fault in the film.

428
00:55:10,531 --> 00:55:12,840
A strange coincidence.

429
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:22,285
Then it happened again.

430
00:55:23,051 --> 00:55:25,804
Interesting, don't you think?

431
00:55:27,171 --> 00:55:31,483
And this... I took on the day
that you were at the rugby match.

432
00:55:31,571 --> 00:55:34,005
- Same thing?
- Only it's more pronounced...

433
00:55:34,091 --> 00:55:37,606
...and it's actually
making contact with the body.

434
00:55:40,051 --> 00:55:43,282
The rest, of course - history.

435
00:55:43,371 --> 00:55:45,362
I can't explain it.

436
00:55:48,931 --> 00:55:55,279
That's why I started digging. The coroner's
report shows that he was riddled with cancer.

437
00:55:55,371 --> 00:55:59,410
High on morphine most of the time.
Injected himself two or three times a day.

438
00:55:59,491 --> 00:56:02,927
- He knew that he was dying?
- Apparently, yes.

439
00:56:05,131 --> 00:56:08,646
He said that he wanted
to be forgiven by Christ.

440
00:56:10,331 --> 00:56:16,361
Externally, his body was normal, except for
one thing on the inside of his right thigh.

441
00:56:16,451 --> 00:56:19,170
- What is it?
- Three sixes.

442
00:56:20,651 --> 00:56:22,528
Six hundred and sixty-six.

443
00:56:24,851 --> 00:56:28,127
- Concentration camp?
- That's what I thought.

444
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:34,286
But the biopsy says it's a birthmark.
The best is yet to come.

445
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:47,125
Pages of the Bible. Thousands of 'em.

446
00:56:47,211 --> 00:56:50,999
Every inch of wall-space covered,
even the windows.

447
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:57,048
He even needed to be close to his church.

448
00:56:58,531 --> 00:57:00,169
<i>(door closes)</i>

449
00:57:01,531 --> 00:57:03,920
There are 47. I counted them.

450
00:57:04,771 --> 00:57:07,968
I think he was trying
to keep something out, don't you?

451
00:57:09,571 --> 00:57:15,407
The police thought he was insane. They let
me come here to see if I could find anything.

452
00:57:19,211 --> 00:57:22,999
The first item... is a diary.

453
00:57:26,451 --> 00:57:28,567
It didn't say anything about him.

454
00:57:28,651 --> 00:57:32,166
It's about you. What time
you left the house, where you went,...

455
00:57:32,251 --> 00:57:36,722
...what restaurants you had your lunch in,
what time your speaking engagements were.

456
00:57:36,811 --> 00:57:41,805
The last entry says that he was supposed to
have met you in Bishop's Park.

457
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:44,564
And that was dated the day he died.

458
00:57:46,451 --> 00:57:52,321
The important items are here. If we're to get
to the bottom of this, we've got to start here.

459
00:57:54,011 --> 00:57:59,085
This first clipping
is from the <i>Astrologer's Monthly.</i>

460
00:57:59,171 --> 00:58:04,928
Reports an unusual phenomenon. A comet
changed its shape into a glowing star,...

461
00:58:05,011 --> 00:58:07,605
...like the star of Bethlehem 2,000 years ago.

462
00:58:07,691 --> 00:58:12,970
This one was on the other side of the world,
the European continent, five years ago.

463
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:17,601
6 June, to be exact.

464
00:58:17,691 --> 00:58:20,649
Does that date mean anything to you?

465
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:22,562
Yes.

466
00:58:22,651 --> 00:58:25,848
Then you'll recollect this other clipping.

467
00:58:25,931 --> 00:58:29,765
It's a birth announcement
from a Rome newspaper.

468
00:58:29,851 --> 00:58:33,127
Also dated 6 June, five years ago.

469
00:58:33,211 --> 00:58:35,679
The day your son was born.

470
00:58:35,771 --> 00:58:38,683
The sixth month, sixth day.

471
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:44,005
Was your son born at 6am?

472
00:58:45,651 --> 00:58:50,884
Yes, I'm sorry. I'm just trying to work out
this birthmark. The three sixes.

473
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:56,806
My son is... dead.

474
00:59:00,051 --> 00:59:03,202
I don't know whose son I'm raising.

475
00:59:05,851 --> 00:59:09,969
If you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to help you try and find out.

476
00:59:10,051 --> 00:59:13,441
No. It's my problem.

477
00:59:16,331 --> 00:59:19,607
No, sir, you're wrong. It's my problem too.

478
00:59:23,011 --> 00:59:27,448
When I came here with the police,
I took some photographs.

479
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:31,968
I happened to catch sight
of my own reflection in that mirror.

480
00:59:45,891 --> 00:59:50,043
I know you must think I'm crazy,
but I'm so frightened.

481
00:59:50,131 --> 00:59:55,285
Don't be afraid. You'll be all right here.
You'll be perfectly all right.

482
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:00,086
Ow.

483
01:00:00,171 --> 01:00:02,162
Some all right!

484
01:00:03,131 --> 01:00:06,441
- What about Damien?
- I'll speak to Mrs Horton.

485
01:00:06,531 --> 01:00:09,125
She'll look after him.

486
01:00:14,491 --> 01:00:16,482
Mrs Horton?

487
01:00:17,091 --> 01:00:19,082
Mrs Horton?

488
01:00:20,611 --> 01:00:22,920
- Mrs Baylock.
- Sir.

489
01:00:23,011 --> 01:00:25,605
- Where's Mrs Horton?
- Gone.

490
01:00:26,651 --> 01:00:29,961
- Gone out?
- No, they've gone. They just got up and went.

491
01:00:30,051 --> 01:00:34,283
They left an address for you
to send their last month's wages to.

492
01:00:34,371 --> 01:00:39,968
Well, didn't... Mrs Horton say anything?
Didn't Horton leave any explanation?

493
01:00:40,051 --> 01:00:43,088
No. But don't worry, sir. I can manage.

494
01:00:53,211 --> 01:00:56,362
- I'll look into this when I get back.
- Just as you wish, sir.

495
01:00:56,451 --> 01:00:58,567
- Oh, and Mrs Baylock?
- Sir?

496
01:00:58,651 --> 01:01:02,246
Last night, I saw that dog in Damien's room.
I clearly told you...

497
01:01:02,331 --> 01:01:06,119
He's gone now, sir.
They took him away this morning.

498
01:01:35,011 --> 01:01:38,128
<i>- Non è questo.
- Ospedale dei Cappuccini.</i>

499
01:01:38,211 --> 01:01:41,328
<i>- Non è questo.
- Sì! Ospedale dei Cappuccini.</i>

500
01:01:43,091 --> 01:01:44,365
No.

501
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:47,887
<i>Io ricordo la vecchia, in mattone.</i>

502
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:51,569
This is the right address.

503
01:01:51,651 --> 01:01:54,290
<i>Ci fu un incendio anni fa.</i>

504
01:01:55,091 --> 01:01:58,128
<i>- Ma cosa è successo?
- Ci fu un terribile incendio.</i>

505
01:01:58,211 --> 01:02:01,487
<i>- Il vecchio ospedale fu distrutto.</i>
- There was a terrible fire...

506
01:02:01,571 --> 01:02:06,201
- ...and the old hospital burned down.
<i>- È stato cinque anni fa.</i>

507
01:02:09,371 --> 01:02:11,566
Five years ago.

508
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:17,006
<i>- Aspetta, per favore.</i>
- OK.

509
01:02:28,051 --> 01:02:32,249
But surely the fire didn't destroy everything.
There must have been some records.

510
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:37,041
<i>Mi dispiace.</i>
I sorry. I think everything was destroyed.

511
01:02:37,131 --> 01:02:40,168
Isn't it possible
there were some papers stored elsewhere?

512
01:02:40,251 --> 01:02:42,446
- I do not know.
- Sister.

513
01:02:43,731 --> 01:02:46,199
This is most important to me.

514
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:49,761
I adopted a child here.
I'm searching for some records of it...

515
01:02:49,851 --> 01:02:52,763
- There were no adoptions here.
- There was one.

516
01:02:52,851 --> 01:02:55,684
- No, <i>signore.</i>
- It wasn't an actual adoption.

517
01:02:55,851 --> 01:02:58,285
- You are mistake.
- Wait.

518
01:02:58,371 --> 01:03:03,001
Birth records.
If I gave you a date. An exact date.

519
01:03:03,091 --> 01:03:06,845
It's no use. The fire started
in the hall of records in the basement.

520
01:03:06,931 --> 01:03:09,729
All the paperwork was there.
Went up like a torch.

521
01:03:09,811 --> 01:03:12,928
Shot up the stairwells.
The third floor became an inferno.

522
01:03:13,011 --> 01:03:16,686
- The third floor?
- The maternity wards. Nothing left but ashes.

523
01:03:16,771 --> 01:03:20,127
- You will excuse me?
- What about the staff?

524
01:03:20,211 --> 01:03:22,771
- Surely some survived.
- <i>Sì</i>, some.

525
01:03:22,851 --> 01:03:25,684
There was a tall man, a priest.

526
01:03:25,771 --> 01:03:28,444
Dark eyes. Piercing eyes.

527
01:03:28,531 --> 01:03:30,886
<i>Sì. Padre Spiletto.</i>

528
01:03:30,971 --> 01:03:31,926
Yes.

529
01:03:32,011 --> 01:03:35,003
- He was <i>principale.</i>
- Yes, he was in charge. Is he...

530
01:03:35,091 --> 01:03:37,161
- Yes, he is alive.
- Is he here?

531
01:03:37,251 --> 01:03:38,400
- No.
- Where?

532
01:03:38,491 --> 01:03:42,166
He's in a <i>monastero</i> in... Frosinone.

533
01:03:42,971 --> 01:03:46,566
Many were taken there. Many die.

534
01:03:46,651 --> 01:03:50,200
Perhaps he is die since,
but he lived through the fire.

535
01:03:50,731 --> 01:03:53,370
I remember people say it was <i>un miracolo.</i>

536
01:03:54,171 --> 01:03:58,767
- Frosinone?
<i>- Sì. Il monastero di San Domenico.</i>

537
01:03:58,851 --> 01:04:01,319
<i>- Mille grazie, signora.
- Prego.</i>

538
01:04:23,731 --> 01:04:26,564
- Here we are.
- What is it?

539
01:04:26,651 --> 01:04:29,449
- "When the Jews return to Zion..."
- That's the poem.

540
01:04:29,531 --> 01:04:31,999
"When the Jews return to Zion..."

541
01:04:32,091 --> 01:04:35,049
And there was something about a comet.

542
01:04:35,131 --> 01:04:39,204
Yes, that's here too. "The shower of stars
and the rise of the Roman Empire."

543
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:43,569
These are supposed to be the events
that signal the birth of the Antichrist.

544
01:04:43,651 --> 01:04:45,642
The devil's child.

545
01:04:50,771 --> 01:04:56,368
It's making more sense. The Jews have
returned to Zion and there has been a comet.

546
01:04:56,451 --> 01:04:58,601
As for the rise of the Roman Empire,...

547
01:04:58,691 --> 01:05:02,923
...scholars think that could well mean
the Common Market, the Treaty of Rome.

548
01:05:03,011 --> 01:05:06,560
- Bit of a stretch.
- What about this? In Revelations it says:

549
01:05:06,651 --> 01:05:10,485
- "He shall rise from the eternal sea."
- That's the poem again.

550
01:05:10,571 --> 01:05:14,280
"From the eternal sea he rises,
creating armies on either shore."

551
01:05:14,371 --> 01:05:17,681
- That was the beginning of it.
- Theologians have interpreted...

552
01:05:17,771 --> 01:05:21,161
...the "eternal sea"
as meaning the world of politics,...

553
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:25,529
...the sea that constantly rages
with turmoil and revolution.

554
01:05:26,771 --> 01:05:31,162
So the devil's child will rise
from the world of politics.

555
01:05:39,131 --> 01:05:41,122
<i>(church bell ringing)</i>

556
01:05:51,731 --> 01:05:54,086
Looks like this is as far as we go.

557
01:05:54,171 --> 01:05:56,162
Let's have a look.

558
01:07:19,851 --> 01:07:21,842
Found him?

559
01:07:39,891 --> 01:07:44,487
His mind is active,
but since the fire he's not made a sound.

560
01:07:44,571 --> 01:07:47,005
We feed him and take care of his needs.

561
01:07:47,091 --> 01:07:50,481
And we pray for his recovery
when his penance is completed.

562
01:07:50,571 --> 01:07:52,004
What penance?

563
01:07:52,091 --> 01:07:54,889
"Woe to the shepherd
who abandons his sheep."

564
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:57,963
"May his right arm wither
and his right eye lose its sight."

565
01:07:58,051 --> 01:08:00,804
He's fallen from grace. Can you tell us why?

566
01:08:00,891 --> 01:08:02,882
For abandoning Christ.

567
01:08:02,971 --> 01:08:06,008
- How do you know he's abandoned Christ?
- He told us.

568
01:08:06,091 --> 01:08:09,970
- But he doesn't speak.
- There is some movement in his left hand.

569
01:08:10,051 --> 01:08:12,645
He was able to write it down.

570
01:08:16,571 --> 01:08:19,404
You will notice the curved line over the head.

571
01:08:19,491 --> 01:08:23,370
This indicates the hood of the monk.
His own hood.

572
01:08:23,451 --> 01:08:26,568
- The three sixes.
- Six is the sign of the devil.

573
01:08:26,651 --> 01:08:31,122
- But why three of them?
- We believe it signifies the diabolical trinity.

574
01:08:31,211 --> 01:08:36,808
- The devil, Antichrist and false prophet.
- Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

575
01:08:36,891 --> 01:08:42,727
For everything holy, there is something
unholy. This is the essence of temptation.

576
01:08:48,051 --> 01:08:51,441
Father Spiletto, my name is Thorn.

577
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:58,005
There was a child.
I want to know where that child came from.

578
01:08:58,091 --> 01:09:02,323
- I am afraid that...
- You confessed to them. Now confess to me.

579
01:09:02,411 --> 01:09:05,130
- What happened?
- Please, <i>signore.</i>

580
01:09:05,211 --> 01:09:08,601
You said you knew its mother.
Where is she now?

581
01:09:08,691 --> 01:09:13,606
- I must insist that you do not...
- I beg you... where is she?

582
01:09:14,731 --> 01:09:17,040
Answer me!

583
01:09:17,251 --> 01:09:18,479

Cerveteri.

589
01:10:35,051 --> 01:10:37,929
It is an old cemetery from Etruscan times.

590
01:10:38,011 --> 01:10:40,650
Cripta Sant 'Angelo.

591
01:10:40,731 --> 01:10:45,009
- It is nothing but ruins.
- Where is this place?

592
01:10:45,091 --> 01:10:48,561
- But there is nothing there. Only graves.
- Where is it?

593
01:10:49,891 --> 01:10:53,600
You will find it on the map.
It is perhaps 50km north of Rome.

This woman could be

620
01:16:36,731 --> 01:16:39,120
Robert.

621
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:51,528
<i>(ferocious barking)</i>

622
01:16:51,611 --> 01:16:54,967
Don't run. It's only the smell of the graves.

623
01:17:05,491 --> 01:17:07,402
Run!

624
01:17:08,651 --> 01:17:10,130
Robert!

625
01:17:41,571 --> 01:17:44,881
Aagh! Aagh!

626
01:18:56,371 --> 01:18:58,248
<i>(phone rings)</i>

627
01:19:13,611 --> 01:19:16,648

- Hello.

628
01:19:16,731 --> 01:19:18,722
Kathy?

629
01:19:19,811 --> 01:19:23,486
<i>Hello, Robert. Is that you?
Oh, I'm so glad you called.</i>

630
01:19:23,571 --> 01:19:28,850
Kathy, darling.
Now, listen to me... very carefully.

631
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:31,001
Do just what I say.

632
01:19:31,091 --> 01:19:34,322
I want you to leave London right now.

633
01:19:34,891 --> 01:19:39,407
- What do you mean, leave London, darling?
<i>- I've put through a call to the embassy.</i>

634
01:19:39,491 --> 01:19:44,485
Tom Portman will meet you at the hospital
and bring you here to Rome.

635
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:48,246
- Robert, what's happened? What's wrong?
<i>- Please, darling. Just do it.</i>

636
01:19:48,331 --> 01:19:50,720
<i>Get ready to leave.</i>

637
01:19:52,291 --> 01:19:56,807
- Robert, I don't think I can move very well.
- Kathy, do it.

638
01:19:57,091 --> 01:20:02,211
OK. Yes, all right, I'll...
I'll try to be ready by the time he gets here.

639
01:20:02,291 --> 01:20:04,282
<i>All right, darling.</i>

640
01:20:41,811 --> 01:20:44,530
Who is that? Is that somebody there?

641
01:20:44,611 --> 01:20:47,000
Tom? Is that you?

642
01:21:08,211 --> 01:21:09,803
<i>(smashing glass)</i>

643
01:21:09,891 --> 01:21:12,007

01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:25,202
<i>(phone rings)</i>

645
01:21:39,371 --> 01:21:41,362
Yes?

646
01:21:42,171 --> 01:21:44,162
Yes, this is he.

647
01:21:47,451 --> 01:21:49,442
Tom?

648
01:21:56,811 --> 01:21:58,802
Kathy?

649
01:22:05,571 --> 01:22:07,562
Tom,...

650
01:22:08,691 --> 01:22:11,808
...I can't... talk now.

651
01:23:04,211 --> 01:23:06,202
Robert.

652
01:23:06,971 --> 01:23:09,883
I found out about the town of Megiddo.

653
01:23:12,931 --> 01:23:16,128
It's derived from the word "Armageddon".

654
01:23:17,651 --> 01:23:20,609
The end of the world.

655
01:23:20,691 --> 01:23:23,524
It's underground,
about 60 miles south of Jerusalem.

656
01:23:23,611 --> 01:23:26,728
There's some excavation going on there.

657
01:23:28,291 --> 01:23:31,886
If only you could remember the name
of the man you're supposed to see.

658
01:23:31,971 --> 01:23:33,962
It's Bugenhagen.

659
01:23:34,811 --> 01:23:37,450
He was an exorcist. I read about him.

660
01:23:38,091 --> 01:23:41,879
That was his name.
And I remember the poem.

661
01:23:42,571 --> 01:23:45,290
"When the Jews return to Zion,...

662
01:23:45,371 --> 01:23:48,010
...and a comet fills the sky...

663
01:23:48,091 --> 01:23:51,447
...and the Holy Roman Empire rises,...

664
01:23:51,531 --> 01:23:53,920
...then you and I must die."

665
01:23:55,051 --> 01:23:59,522
"From the eternal sea he rises,...

666
01:23:59,611 --> 01:24:02,489
...creating armies on either shore...

667
01:24:03,451 --> 01:24:06,488
...turning man against his brother...

668
01:24:08,171 --> 01:24:11,720
...till man exists no more."

669
01:24:17,651 --> 01:24:20,040
Kathy is dead.

670
01:24:22,411 --> 01:24:25,005
I want Damien to die, too.

671
01:25:18,331 --> 01:25:20,640
Hello, Mr Thorn.

672
01:25:20,731 --> 01:25:23,120
I am Bugenhagen.

673
01:25:23,211 --> 01:25:26,999
<i>- (Robert)</i> What is this place?
- The city of Jezreel.

674
01:25:28,371 --> 01:25:30,760
Town of Megiddo.

675
01:25:31,531 --> 01:25:33,806
The place...

676
01:25:33,891 --> 01:25:36,280
...where Christianity began.

677
01:25:38,331 --> 01:25:41,846
The little priest - is he dead yet?

678
01:25:42,651 --> 01:25:44,448
Yes.

679
01:25:47,091 --> 01:25:49,082
Yes.

680
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:56,485
Come along, Mr Thorn.
We had better get to work.

681
01:26:05,931 --> 01:26:08,320
You will excuse us.

682
01:26:09,211 --> 01:26:12,009
This is for Mr Thorn alone.

683
01:26:13,811 --> 01:26:15,802
All right.

684
01:27:07,731 --> 01:27:11,406
It must be done on hallowed ground.

685
01:27:13,251 --> 01:27:15,606
A church.

686
01:27:15,691 --> 01:27:19,161
His blood must be spilled on the altar of God.

687
01:27:22,531 --> 01:27:26,444
This first knife is most important.

688
01:27:28,731 --> 01:27:34,601
It extinguishes physical life
and forms the centre of the cross.

689
01:27:36,571 --> 01:27:41,326
The subsequent placings
extinguish spiritual life...

690
01:27:41,411 --> 01:27:44,642
...and should radiate outward.

691
01:27:44,731 --> 01:27:46,722
Like this.

692
01:27:49,571 --> 01:27:55,328
This is not a human child. Make no mistake.

693
01:28:04,331 --> 01:28:06,925
- Is there proof?
- Oh, yes.

694
01:28:07,931 --> 01:28:10,286
He bears a birthmark.

695
01:28:11,571 --> 01:28:13,880
A sequence of sixes.

696
01:28:14,371 --> 01:28:17,727
So, says the Bible,
do all the apostles of Satan.

697
01:28:19,451 --> 01:28:22,648
- He doesn't have it.
- He must have it.

698
01:28:23,771 --> 01:28:26,524
I've bathed him. I know every inch of him.

699
01:28:27,771 --> 01:28:33,209
If it is not visible on the body,
it will be beneath the hair.

700
01:28:34,971 --> 01:28:37,531
Remove it.

701
01:28:38,051 --> 01:28:41,088
You must be devoid of pity.

702
01:28:43,611 --> 01:28:48,480
- And the woman?
- She is an apostate of hell.

703
01:28:48,571 --> 01:28:51,688
She will die before permitting this.

704
01:28:59,451 --> 01:29:05,162
Look, I want to know what he said.
I've a right to know.

705
01:29:05,331 --> 01:29:09,802
Robert, I want to know what he said!
Look, I'm not just some bystander.

706
01:29:09,891 --> 01:29:13,770
- I was the one that found him!
- I'm the one that's supposed to kill him.

707
01:29:13,851 --> 01:29:17,605
These are knives. He wants me to stab him.

708
01:29:17,691 --> 01:29:20,683
- Wants me to murder a child.
- It's not a child!

709
01:29:20,771 --> 01:29:23,444
How can he know that? Maybe he's wrong.

710
01:29:23,531 --> 01:29:28,525
It's insane. I won't have anything
to do with murdering a little boy!

711
01:29:28,611 --> 01:29:31,444
He's not responsible. I won't do it.

712
01:29:39,331 --> 01:29:42,050
Well, if you don't do it, I will.
