1
00:00:58,447 --> 00:01:00,278
(Crunch)

2
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:57,799
(Highest girl) Tah-dah!

3
00:03:06,327 --> 00:03:08,477
(Highest girl) Come on, slow poke!

4
00:03:08,527 --> 00:03:11,758
Don't lean forward!
Don't lean forward!

5
00:03:11,807 --> 00:03:14,640
(Laughing)

6
00:03:22,647 --> 00:03:26,276
(Man) Come on, Overman.
Give us a break, will you?

7
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:29,522
Look at the clown
in the jockey shorts!

8
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:31,319
Kelly, come on. Pay attention.

9
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:33,244
Hey, girls!

10
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:37,156
Do it like this! Ooh!

11
00:03:43,727 --> 00:03:46,605
(Man) Damn it, Kelly! Do the job!

12
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:49,320
Next time we're goin'
right into the lagoon.

13
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:51,756
The lagoon is my favourite! (Laughs)

14
00:03:55,687 --> 00:03:59,521
Damn boat.
I flooded the... Damn boat!

15
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:02,320
(Girl) Come on, Richie.
I got a date tonight!

16
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,119
(Skier) Through the gate!

17
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:08,122
(Richie ) Come on, baby.

18
00:04:12,647 --> 00:04:14,365
(Motor starts)

19
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:16,443
(Richie ) OK, guys, here we go.

20
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:18,603
Oh! That's right. Good.

21
00:04:30,007 --> 00:04:33,363
(Woman) You've been chosen
for your neatness,

22
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,717
courtesy toward others
and your Southern grace.

23
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:41,158
We enforce our dress code here,
so keep your hair and nails trimmed.

24
00:04:41,207 --> 00:04:43,767
And, please,
don't alter your costumes.

25
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:46,799
Once you've got your Sea World
guide apparel,

26
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:49,122
the shorts are short enough.

27
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:50,316
(Girl giggles)

28
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:53,803
Show any cheek and you'll be back
shovellin' french fries.

29
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:54,836
(Girls giggling)

30
00:04:54,887 --> 00:04:59,802
Now, let's continue with our welcome
speech again. All together now.

31
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:01,963
(All) Welcome to Sea World,

32
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:04,999
the world's largest marine life park.

33
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:09,359
Above and below the surface
of our unique Undersea Kingdom...

34
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,883
(Man) The park opens on Saturday.

35
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:16,522
All this week has been,
and continues to be, preview week,

36
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:20,446
during which family and friends
attend Sea World as our guests.

37
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,637
This is the Undersea Kingdom,

38
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:26,726
four years under construction,
at a cost of more than $34 million.

39
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:30,396
Four pressurised viewing tunnels
radiate out into the lagoon.

40
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:34,326
There's the Sunken Spanish Galleon,
Jonah's Marine Fun House,

41
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:38,440
the Deepwater Coral Forest,
all connected to Central Control.

42
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:42,560
And a deluxe restaurant and lounge,
all 40 feet below the surface.

43
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:45,167
The complex is built
in our manmade lagoon,

44
00:05:45,207 --> 00:05:47,880
which connects to the ocean
by a deep channel.

45
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:50,919
The new additions to Sea World
are the brainchild

46
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:53,481
of entrepreneur Calvin Bouchard.

47
00:05:58,247 --> 00:05:59,965
(Kelly ) Hi, guys!

48
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:02,123
(Girl) Now you can close the gate.

49
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:08,924
(Gate motor whirring)

50
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,196
(Thud)

51
00:06:23,247 --> 00:06:24,362
(Man) Jesus!

52
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:28,923
Overman, I thought you said
those tracks were secure.

53
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:31,197
Hey, I welded
the damn thing myself.

54
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:33,477
(Worker) Something's
hung the gate up.

55
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:36,280
(2nd worker) Better get Brody.
He'll be pissed.

56
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:37,760
Whoo!

57
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:40,446
(Guy ) Here's the lagoon.
Set up for the turn.

58
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:43,718
(PR man) I call your attention
to the Sea World skiers,

59
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:45,325
who are entering the lagoon

60
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:47,835
in a preview
of the opening day ceremonies.

61
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:50,321
(Reporters chattering, indistinct)

62
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,323
Here come my pride and joy.

63
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:56,319
(Female reporter)
Can we talk to Mr Bouchard?

64
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:59,439
- Beautiful. Just beautiful!
- (Girl skier) Hi!

65
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:01,364
(Man) ..this exciting complex.

66
00:07:01,407 --> 00:07:05,719
We WOULD like to avoid
references to his colourful past.

67
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:09,077
(Woman) Did the Undersea Kingdom
really cost $30 million?

68
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:10,799
Aren't those kids great?

69
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,522
Mr Bouchard, is there anything
special goin' on openin' day?

70
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:18,719
Well, this afternoon, at the main
gate, we'll be pleased to announce...

71
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:21,281
the welcomin' of Mr Philip FitzRoyce.

72
00:07:21,327 --> 00:07:23,283
Oh, really? Is that true?

73
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:26,763
No lie, he gonna be here.
Now, we got drinks at the bar.

74
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:28,525
They free. Come on, follow me.

75
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:29,636
(Reporters laugh)

76
00:07:34,807 --> 00:07:37,605
- What's it look like?
- It's off the track.

77
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:41,242
- How'd that happen?
- I can't tell, but she is jammed.

78
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:43,039
Just wouldn't close, Mike.

79
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,759
(Overman) Now what do we do?

80
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:48,117
Somethin' knocked the
son-of-a-bitch right off the track.

81
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,283
Just secure the damn gate, all right?

82
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:53,205
- Think you can handle that?
- On overtime, maybe.

83
00:07:53,247 --> 00:07:55,158
You got enough overtime.

84
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:57,641
- Your party.
- You buy the beer, Brody.

85
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:59,359
Well, look, you're in charge.

86
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:02,444
See you guys later.
I got more important things to do.

87
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:06,605
- No overtime.
- OK. See you, Mike.

88
00:08:06,647 --> 00:08:09,207
(Shouting) No overtime!

89
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:12,159
(All shouting, laughing) No overtime!

90
00:08:13,407 --> 00:08:16,444
(Dolphins clicking)

91
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:25,237
(Clicking loudly )

92
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:31,077
(Clicking continues)

93
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:37,805
(Dolphins clicking, cage rattling)

94
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:39,724
Hi, Mike.

95
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:45,642
- Oh. Ah. Hey, Dan.
- Hey.

96
00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:47,086
Havin' gate problems?

97
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,357
The dolphins tried
to open them again.

98
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,637
- Where's the boss?
- Up with Shamu.

99
00:08:51,687 --> 00:08:52,915
Thanks.

100
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,397
(Woman) Come on, Cindy.

101
00:08:56,447 --> 00:08:59,678
Come on, Sandy. Come on.

102
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:03,003
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey. Come on.

103
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:05,800
It's the boss hard hat.
Where's your boots?

104
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:08,156
I only wear 'em to bed
and in the shower.

105
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:10,675
- Where's Kay?
- She's down that way.

106
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:24,360
Yee-hah! Ride 'em, cowgirl.

107
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:27,358
- Hi, Mike!
- Hey!

108
00:09:27,407 --> 00:09:29,284
I'll be with you in a minute.

109
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:30,646
All right.

110
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:34,885
- Use your spurs.
- Hey, Liz!

111
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:44,045
Good boy. That was nice!

112
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:45,486
- Hey.
- Hey!

113
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:53,367
Liz, he did that great. I don't wanna
do it again. Do me a favour.

114
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,126
Put Cindy and Sandy
in the lagoon for a run.

115
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:57,919
OK.

116
00:09:57,967 --> 00:10:00,162
- How you doin'?
- Great.

117
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:02,118
Hey, you. Come here.

118
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:03,805
(Shamu squeaks)

119
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:07,476
Come here, kiddo.
That's the feeding place.

120
00:10:10,407 --> 00:10:12,875
- Is this whale house-broken yet?
- Nope.

121
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:16,124
- Then he can't come to dinner.
- You takin' me to dinner?

122
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,805
Soon as we pick up my brother.

123
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:19,246
When's Sean coming?

124
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:21,596
We're gonna meet him
at the main gate.

125
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:22,875
(Dan) Kathy.

126
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:26,284
Cindy and Sandy don't wanna go.

127
00:10:26,327 --> 00:10:29,125
Am I gonna lose you
to a couple of neurotic fish?

128
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:31,203
- Mammals.
- Mammals. Mammals.

129
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:33,124
(Dan) Something's bugging 'em.

130
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:37,206
It's play time. They'll be
beggin' us tomorrow. Put 'em up.

131
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:38,600
You got it.

132
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:41,559
- I'm begging you tonight.
- You don't have to beg.

133
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,926
Take me to dinner!

134
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:44,844
All right. Let's try sushi.

135
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:47,117
- Mike!
- I'll change.

136
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,556
Come here. Who's a good boy?

137
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,201
Are you a good boy?
Yes, you're a good boy.

138
00:10:52,247 --> 00:10:53,282
(Shamu gurgles)

139
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:56,205
And you get a fish.

140
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:59,319
(Calvin) Ladies and gentlemen,
here he is now.

141
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:06,924
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Philip
FitzRoyce, with a capital R,

142
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:11,757
is here to film us, meet our resident
day scientific staff.

143
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:17,764
- Hey, what's this?
- Oh, no.

144
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:19,877
Philip the Great.

145
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:22,839
I am able to combine
business with pleasure,

146
00:11:22,887 --> 00:11:26,357
which, they tell me, is the secret
to a long and happy life.

147
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:29,205
- What, FitzRoyce?
- Mmm.

148
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:31,397
Sure is.

149
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:34,644
Any further questions,
in the bar, if you please.

150
00:11:34,687 --> 00:11:36,405
For the first one who buys.

151
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:40,042
- Look at Calvin. Best of buddies.
- Ah, best of friends.

152
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:42,243
(Mike ) A regular Barnum and Bailey.

153
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:45,199
(Kay ) I'm sure they'll
be very happy together.

154
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:48,239
Perfect.
Into the Undersea Kingdom they go.

155
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:49,845
(Chuckle )

156
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,559
Hey, Mikey!

157
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:54,121
- Hey, hey! Hey!
- Oh!

158
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:56,203
- How you doin'?
- All right!

159
00:11:56,247 --> 00:11:59,284
- My brother, the cowboy.
- Hey! Hug me, huh?

160
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:00,885
- Oh, OK.
- Hey.

161
00:12:00,927 --> 00:12:02,804
(Kay shrieks)

162
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,522
You put on weight, you need a shave
and you're too tall.

163
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:08,683
Well, two out of three I can fix.

164
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,764
(Laughs) Get that gear
and let's go. Come on.

165
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:15,163
- So, nice boots.
- Thanks! Aw, gee.

166
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:17,198
How'd you do on your finals?

167
00:12:17,247 --> 00:12:20,796
Great. A gentleman's 'C,'
an incomplete, but I aced Phys Ed.

168
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:22,439
- (Kay ) A real Einstein.
- Glad you're here.

169
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:39,117
(Thud)

170
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:44,438
(Thud)

171
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:56,642
There you go, Charlene.

172
00:13:56,687 --> 00:14:00,566
- (Man) Shelby showed up yet?
- (2nd man) Haven't seen him.

173
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,279
(Woman) What are they doing?

174
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:04,966
(Man) Kelly's really
gettin' this one down.

175
00:14:05,007 --> 00:14:08,920
(Woman) See that big guy? He gets
knocked on his ass every time.

176
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:10,844
(Woman laughs)

177
00:14:12,247 --> 00:14:14,477
- All right, Charlene.
- All right!

178
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,917
Here, let me help you out.
Work with me, work with me.

179
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:19,195
Let's go.

180
00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:22,045
- There we go.
- Wait. One more.

181
00:14:22,087 --> 00:14:23,918
- Hey, Mike.
- All right. Yeah?

182
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:25,958
Is Shelby workin' overtime?

183
00:14:26,007 --> 00:14:28,840
Not on my say-so.
He was supposed to knock off.

184
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:30,479
Have you met my kid brother?

185
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:33,644
If he's messin' with that bitch
at the souvenir stand,

186
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:35,120
it's gonna be his ass.

187
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:38,477
- You tell him.
- Charlene, I'm not his mother.

188
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:41,439
- You're his boss.
- Yeah, ask Woodbury, OK?

189
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:47,878
(Man) Come on, Kelly. You can do it!

190
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:50,956
- They're playing stand-off.
- Uh-oh.

191
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:55,398
My brother considers himself the
stand-off champion of New England.

192
00:14:55,447 --> 00:14:57,244
And the western states.

193
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:59,926
- Go get 'em.
- (Growls)

194
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:02,561
(Whooping, laughter)

195
00:15:02,607 --> 00:15:05,246
Hey, I wasn't ready!

196
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:11,086
I tell you, it's a game of balance.
I told you he'd fall on his ass.

197
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:14,085
(Man) Hey, who's this guy?

198
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:20,004
This is for beers. You buyin'?

199
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:21,878
Ready?

200
00:15:37,447 --> 00:15:39,324
My fly's open. (Chuckles)

201
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:42,040
(Bystanders gasping)

202
00:15:42,087 --> 00:15:45,079
- No fair!
- (Guy ) Whooo!

203
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:47,277
Well, it's, uh...

204
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:50,956
not only a game of balance,
it's a game of deception.

205
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:55,285
Come on, I'll buy you two
and the one you owe me.

206
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:57,477
- OK.
- All right.

207
00:15:57,527 --> 00:16:00,564
(Bystander) All right.
(Girl) See you later, Kelly.

208
00:16:00,607 --> 00:16:03,326
Hey, I want you.
Come on, right now! Let's go.

209
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:07,767
- Kathryn, Mike.
- (Mike ) Hi.

210
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:10,765
- You know each other?
- I see my brother nailed you.

211
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:12,525
- Your brother?
- Yeah.

212
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:15,764
Without that old crotch trick,
he'd never have won.

213
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:18,605
- That's his best move.
- Runs in the family.

214
00:16:18,647 --> 00:16:20,239
Well, it worked.

215
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:23,677
- What are we drinkin'?
- Champagne of the working classes.

216
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:27,003
- Beer. You owe me a couple.
- That's right. Comin' up.

217
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:29,925
Two beers.
So, you work at the park, huh?

218
00:16:29,967 --> 00:16:32,686
- Mm-hmm. I'm a water skier.
- Oh.

219
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:35,560
(Laughs) Your brother's cute.

220
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:40,317
Yeah. Him and Kathryn have, uh, been
together for a year and a half.

221
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,119
How about you?

222
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:45,835
Desperately unattached.

223
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:49,357
Lonely, confused.

224
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:53,116
Generous and loving to a fault.
It's all in my eyes.

225
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:56,756
(Man) Come on.
(2nd man) OK.

226
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,002
We'll cop a lot of
good stuff tonight.

227
00:16:59,047 --> 00:17:01,322
- I've got the tanks.
- Shh!

228
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:03,961
- Is the van OK here?
- Yes, it's OK.

229
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:07,886
We're off Sea World property.
Nobody uses this road.

230
00:17:12,207 --> 00:17:14,038
Shh!

231
00:17:14,087 --> 00:17:15,679
Yeah.

232
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:18,718
Yeah.

233
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:22,077
Climb over the fence,
and take it easy with the raft.

234
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:23,401
(Clatter)

235
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:25,005
(Whispering) Damn it!

236
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:27,838
You asshole.

237
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:31,243
Now we gotta drag it
all the way down to the water!

238
00:17:31,287 --> 00:17:34,723
- Ready to go?
- OK. Who's payin'?

239
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:42,566
Ah.

240
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:57,119
- Watch out. Snakes.
- Oh, come on. Don't bullshit me.

241
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:58,998
Chicken, huh?

242
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:08,883
- (Croaks)
- (Man gasps)

243
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:10,599
All right, steady.

244
00:18:10,647 --> 00:18:13,320
- Steady.
- Got it.

245
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:15,244
OK. Here we go.

246
00:18:15,287 --> 00:18:18,563
- Hey, Kelly, is this your car?
- Sure is.

247
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:20,723
Hey. Get off of there!

248
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,837
(Moaning, groaning)

249
00:18:22,887 --> 00:18:25,003
- You wanna take a walk?
- Yeah.

250
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:27,607
Hey, what about baby brother?

251
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:29,842
- Aww!
- Aww!

252
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:31,798
Little baby brother.

253
00:18:31,847 --> 00:18:35,396
Kelly, can you give him a ride home,
or shall I call his mommy?

254
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,156
- Nah, if he'll come quietly.
- No way. I scream and shout.

255
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:41,721
Oh, God, it stinks out here.
Let's get away!

256
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:44,645
- See ya.
- Hey, let's go swimming.

257
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:49,124
- N-no, I hate the ocean.
- Aww! Hey, I've got a better idea.

258
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:52,000
- Like lagoons?
- Lagoons?

259
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,402
- Lagoons.
- (She laughs)

260
00:18:54,447 --> 00:18:56,438
(Engine starts)

261
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,804
Oh. How come Sean
doesn't visit more?

262
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:06,803
- He hates the water.
- What?

263
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:12,683
Yeah. Remember that shark attack I
told you about when we were in Amity?

264
00:19:12,727 --> 00:19:16,003
Well, that's why he goes
to school in Colorado.

265
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:19,437
If our parents didn't live
on an island, he'd never get wet.

266
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:22,081
- (She laughs)
- My dad, he's the same way.

267
00:19:24,687 --> 00:19:26,484
God, I love this place.

268
00:19:27,647 --> 00:19:30,366
I hated it when we first came here.

269
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:32,284
What's the matter?

270
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:36,638
Did you get a telephone call?

271
00:19:39,487 --> 00:19:41,125
Venezuela?

272
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:45,599
Guess I'm gonna have to start
learning Spanish.

273
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:49,037
- Ooh, baby.
- Yeah. Yeah.

274
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:52,523
That's wonderful. That's wonderful.

275
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,444
Oh, shit.

276
00:19:55,887 --> 00:19:57,684
Reality.

277
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:00,883
How long?

278
00:20:00,927 --> 00:20:03,395
Just a short year and a half.

279
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:10,601
I'd love you to come, you know.

280
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:12,524
Yeah.

281
00:20:14,407 --> 00:20:18,195
But what about the six months
I've got left here

282
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:21,398
and the job opening up
at the Scripps Institute?

283
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:24,245
What about that? Huh?

284
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:28,280
Simple. Just give up your life
and follow me.

285
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,885
(She laughs)

286
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:36,038
- Oh, I'm happy for you. I am.
- I know you are.

287
00:20:37,447 --> 00:20:39,199
What are we gonna do?

288
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:47,563
- Aha.
- Mm-hmm.

289
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,118
(Both chuckling)

290
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,398
- Ooh!
- (Laughs)

291
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,238
(Chuckles)

292
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:18,964
Come on.

293
00:21:19,007 --> 00:21:23,000
- Oh, I don't go in the water.
- You don't swim?

294
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:25,356
Not even with friends?

295
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:29,798
Oh, uh, I swim.
I just, uh, I... I...

296
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:34,284
(Sighs) It's something that happened
when I was a kid.

297
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:37,125
I don't go in the water.
(Laughs awkwardly )

298
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:39,044
Hmm.

299
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:42,124
I bet I can overcome
your childhood fears.

300
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,038
I bet you can.

301
00:21:53,207 --> 00:21:55,038
Come on.

302
00:21:56,007 --> 00:21:57,884
My boots!

303
00:21:57,927 --> 00:22:00,521
Kick 'em off, cowboy.

304
00:22:08,007 --> 00:22:12,876
- Kelly!
- Come on in, Sean. It's fun.

305
00:22:14,607 --> 00:22:16,643
Come on.

306
00:22:18,327 --> 00:22:20,204
- Here?
- Yeah, OK.

307
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:23,045
Somewhere down there
is the best coral.

308
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:27,080
A guy in Miami will give us
$200 for the good stuff.

309
00:22:27,127 --> 00:22:29,766
Put it in the basket.
I'll pull it up.

310
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:45,005
(Kelly laughing in distance )

311
00:22:50,887 --> 00:22:52,684
Come on, hurry, Randy.

312
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:09,278
I love this park at night.
It's so deserted.

313
00:23:09,327 --> 00:23:10,555
Yeah. So quiet.

314
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:12,996
Wait a second.
Isn't that Kelly's car?

315
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:16,323
Stop, stop, stop. Shh! Wait a second.

316
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:18,722
Stop.

317
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:23,878
Shh.

318
00:23:34,127 --> 00:23:35,958
(Giggling)

319
00:23:49,647 --> 00:23:51,683
I don't believe it.

320
00:23:51,727 --> 00:23:54,002
She got him in the water.

321
00:23:54,047 --> 00:23:56,641
Never underestimate the power, huh?

322
00:24:11,127 --> 00:24:15,643
Attention. You, in the water. You are
trespassing on Sea World property.

323
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:19,760
Come out of the water with your hands
raised high above your head.

324
00:24:19,807 --> 00:24:21,763
I'm OK. My brother works here.

325
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:26,198
Uh, I'm Kelly Ann Bukowski,
from the ski team.

326
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:28,397
You turkeys have any ID?

327
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:31,086
Wait a minute.

328
00:24:31,127 --> 00:24:33,277
- Mike? Kay?
- Brother?

329
00:24:33,327 --> 00:24:35,966
Mr Bullhorn sees all, knows all!

330
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,725
Dead is what you are!

331
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,645
You keep your hands
to yourself, young m...

332
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,201
- (Kelly screeches)
- Here, take this.

333
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:45,238
(Mike ) Yell for mother!

334
00:24:47,287 --> 00:24:49,562
(Mike, Sean shouting, indistinct)

335
00:24:49,607 --> 00:24:51,962
Finish up down there, damn it!

336
00:24:52,007 --> 00:24:54,601
Come on, Randy.
We gotta get outta here!

337
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:56,922
- (Muffled thud)
- Now what?

338
00:25:00,287 --> 00:25:02,118
Ow!

339
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,758
(Shouts)

340
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:16,879
(Kelly ) Mike!

341
00:25:16,927 --> 00:25:19,043
(Girls screeching)

342
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:20,964
(Kelly yelling, indistinct)

343
00:25:21,007 --> 00:25:23,760
(Yelling, screaming)

344
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,246
- (Kay ) You cheater!
- (Screams)

345
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:35,001
(Sean)
That's what you are! Dead!

346
00:25:38,647 --> 00:25:41,639
Some guys can sleep in
in the morning.

347
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:44,804
Some of us have to
be at work early. Good morning.

348
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:49,159
Some of us don't have to baby-sit a
park full of slugs and fishes either.

349
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:51,801
Yes, we just live
like slugs and fishes.

350
00:25:51,847 --> 00:25:54,998
The dog does not
eat on the counter.

351
00:25:55,047 --> 00:25:59,165
(Groans) I put your wet clothes
in the dryer, sweetie.

352
00:25:59,207 --> 00:26:02,085
- Thanks.
- Mmm. What are we eating?

353
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,118
Mmm. Thank you.

354
00:26:05,487 --> 00:26:08,320
Hey, is this my beeper
or your beeper?

355
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:11,677
- I dunno. I'll use this beeper.
- Use that beeper.

356
00:26:11,727 --> 00:26:13,080
Talk to you later.

357
00:26:13,127 --> 00:26:15,357
I'll have my beeper
beep your beeper.

358
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,126
I'll have my beeper
beep your beeper back.

359
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:20,476
- Bye.
- See you later.

360
00:26:21,607 --> 00:26:22,801
Aye.

361
00:26:23,807 --> 00:26:24,842
Coffee?

362
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:27,845
Just throw it in my eyes,
it'll work faster.

363
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:30,526
That's what happens
when you stay up all night

364
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:32,478
workin' out childhood phobias.

365
00:26:32,527 --> 00:26:35,087
That's right.
Make fun of your baby brother.

366
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:38,403
I was this close to doing it
in the water last night,

367
00:26:38,447 --> 00:26:39,721
and that's a first.

368
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:42,645
- This close, huh?
- Shut up!

369
00:26:42,687 --> 00:26:44,564
(Laughs)

370
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:47,280
Sorry. I didn't know it was therapy.

371
00:26:47,327 --> 00:26:49,283
Just admit it. You messed me up.

372
00:26:49,327 --> 00:26:52,558
I admit it. I messed you up.

373
00:26:52,607 --> 00:26:55,440
Is everything all right
with you and Kathryn?

374
00:26:55,487 --> 00:26:57,079
(Phone )

375
00:26:57,127 --> 00:26:59,357
Hello? Yes, sir.

376
00:27:03,447 --> 00:27:06,245
Calvin, I had my crew
on that yesterday.

377
00:27:06,287 --> 00:27:09,245
Well, I know.
I don't want that to happen either.

378
00:27:09,287 --> 00:27:11,039
(Sighs) Tomorrow.

379
00:27:12,487 --> 00:27:15,604
OK, OK. Calvin, I'll be right there.

380
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:19,162
- The boss, right?
- I gotta go to work.

381
00:27:21,527 --> 00:27:24,963
- Yeah, can't do better than that!
- Really.

382
00:27:25,007 --> 00:27:27,601
(Squeaking)

383
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:30,161
Yeah. Yeah!

384
00:27:30,207 --> 00:27:32,801
Who's a good girl?That's my baby.

385
00:27:32,847 --> 00:27:34,724
(Dan) Kay?

386
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:37,235
(Kay ) How are Cindy and Sandy?

387
00:27:37,287 --> 00:27:40,438
Well, Cindy's OK,
but Sandy's still nervous.

388
00:27:42,447 --> 00:27:46,235
(Kay ) Don't quit, Danny.
He can go higher.

389
00:27:49,047 --> 00:27:50,924
(Kay ) That's it!

390
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:55,884
OK, girls. There are my girls.

391
00:27:55,927 --> 00:27:59,476
Thank you. Come on. Ready...and go!

392
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:01,324
That's it.

393
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:06,117
What is this?
You ready? I said go!

394
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:11,002
If those are the best behaviours,
I'd hate to see the worst.

395
00:28:12,287 --> 00:28:14,118
May I help you?

396
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:16,123
Are you looking for somebody?

397
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:20,160
No, I don't think you can.
I'm looking for someone in authority.

398
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:23,279
Well, I'm Dr Morgan,
the senior biologist.

399
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,477
Oh.

400
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:26,801
Really?

401
00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:32,404
Charming. Philip FitzRoyce.

402
00:28:32,447 --> 00:28:34,244
I know you. I know your work.

403
00:28:34,287 --> 00:28:37,836
We were at that Law of the Sea
Conference together last summer.

404
00:28:37,887 --> 00:28:40,003
Right. Helsinki. Save the Whales.

405
00:28:40,047 --> 00:28:41,924
They made a hero out of me.

406
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:46,518
You know what I never understood?
Why did you ram that Japanese whaler?

407
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:50,685
(Chuckles) Because he got in my way,
ruined my best shot.

408
00:28:50,727 --> 00:28:53,605
Yeah. I was impressed.

409
00:28:55,927 --> 00:29:00,443
Good. Then perhaps we can have
a drink and some dinner tonight?

410
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:06,238
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr FitzRoyce, but...
that's a behaviour I just don't do.

411
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:13,795
Nice spins, Danny.
I'll meet you at the holding tank.

412
00:29:14,847 --> 00:29:16,678
Hey, aqua girl!

413
00:29:16,727 --> 00:29:20,003
- Hi, Mike!
- Five.

414
00:29:29,847 --> 00:29:31,075
(Grunts)

415
00:29:31,127 --> 00:29:33,880
He don't sleep in, he don't live in.

416
00:29:33,927 --> 00:29:36,521
Tell Shelby Overman
he can take a flyin' leap

417
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:39,764
at a rollin' doughnut on a gravel
driveway, you hear?

418
00:29:39,807 --> 00:29:42,275
Hold it.
Didn't he come home last night?

419
00:29:42,327 --> 00:29:44,682
- No.
- He didn't show up here either.

420
00:29:44,727 --> 00:29:48,481
- I figure he's home hung over.
- I don't want him around my place!

421
00:29:48,527 --> 00:29:50,279
He's gone. You take his stuff.

422
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:52,204
Charlene, what's goin' on, huh?

423
00:29:52,247 --> 00:29:56,160
- Shelby Overman's AWOL again.
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.

424
00:29:56,207 --> 00:29:59,358
- What, is this all his stuff?
- Yeah. Doesn't figure.

425
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:02,922
He left his passport and his...
and his credit cards.

426
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,879
Driver's licence, pawn tickets.

427
00:30:05,927 --> 00:30:09,237
I don't think he could have been
planning to go too far.

428
00:30:09,287 --> 00:30:12,120
You don't think
something happened to him?

429
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:15,523
No. No, look.
He is curled up, drunk someplace.

430
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:17,762
When I find him,
he's in deep trouble.

431
00:30:17,807 --> 00:30:20,480
We'll let you know
as soon as we hear anything.

432
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,485
- Wanna help me out?
- Yeah. Take care, Charlene.

433
00:30:23,527 --> 00:30:25,882
- Help me look in the lagoon?
- You bet.

434
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:28,885
Hey, I'm mad at that old boy,
but I don't mean him any harm.

435
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,797
Down a little more.

436
00:30:37,847 --> 00:30:39,724
Turn it.

437
00:30:43,047 --> 00:30:45,163
Batteries are fully charged, Mike.

438
00:30:45,207 --> 00:30:47,596
- Thank you, Danny.
- Thanks, Danny.

439
00:30:49,207 --> 00:30:52,483
Control room, submersible
is now entering the lagoon.

440
00:30:52,527 --> 00:30:55,758
- Roger.
- I can monitor it from here.

(Squeaks excitedly )

470
00:34:27,127 --> 00:34:28,958
(Squeaks)

471
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:38,886
(Muffled scream)

472
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:50,801
(Muffled exchange )

473
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:04,325
(Mike, Kay, muffled) 'Go! Go!'

474
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:28,565
(Kay ) Mike! Quick! Mike!

475
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:46,359
- The gate! Get the gate!
- Shark!

476
00:35:46,407 --> 00:35:48,125
- God!
- What's happening?

477
00:35:53,207 --> 00:35:55,437
(Dan) Close, damn it! Close!

478
00:35:56,967 --> 00:35:58,559
Shit!

479
00:35:58,607 --> 00:36:01,201
- Oh, God! Are you OK?
- What the hell was that?

480
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:03,477
- Yeah! What is that?
- You OK?

481
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:06,280
My guv'nor's
the 16th Earl of Haddenfield.

482
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:09,637
Shake hands with the first Calvin
of Sea World.

483
00:36:09,687 --> 00:36:12,155
- Enchanté.
- He know French too, huh?

484
00:36:12,207 --> 00:36:13,879
Excuse me, Mr Bouchard...

485
00:36:13,927 --> 00:36:16,521
Wait a minute.
We're havin' dinner here.

486
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:19,445
- This better be important.
- It is, sir.

487
00:36:19,487 --> 00:36:22,843
(Whispers) Mike and Dr Morgan
were pursued by a shark.

488
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:24,843
It is important. Come with me.

489
00:36:31,047 --> 00:36:33,003
(Kay ) Calvin, it was a great white.

490
00:36:33,047 --> 00:36:35,925
Ten feet long, exhibiting
a typical feeding pattern.

491
00:36:35,967 --> 00:36:38,800
On us, Calvin!
The damn thing tried to feed on us.

492
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:41,202
- Where is it?
- Right here.

493
00:36:45,087 --> 00:36:46,645
- Huh?
- (Whistles)

494
00:36:46,687 --> 00:36:50,362
You know, Cal, this
could be a stroke of luck.

495
00:36:50,407 --> 00:36:52,875
If we kill this beastie on camera...

496
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:57,244
I can guarantee you media coverage.

497
00:36:58,487 --> 00:37:01,320
Lure him into a staging area,

498
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:04,837
and at the precise moment,
slit his belly wide open.

499
00:37:06,247 --> 00:37:08,966
- Can you do that?
- You try and stop 'im, mate.

500
00:37:09,007 --> 00:37:11,601
(Chuckles)
That's how we earn our bread.

501
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:17,003
Well, Jack is oversimplifying
matters, as is usual.

502
00:37:17,047 --> 00:37:20,403
But...yeah, I can do that.

503
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,438
(Kay ) No!
(Mike ) No?

504
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:24,682
What do you mean, no?

505
00:37:24,727 --> 00:37:27,560
I don't know
if it's occurred to any of you-all,

506
00:37:27,607 --> 00:37:31,236
but there isn't a great white alive
in captivity anywhere.

507
00:37:31,287 --> 00:37:34,085
Now, we're unique here, Calvin,
you know that.

508
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,766
If any facility can
maintain a white, it's us.

509
00:37:36,807 --> 00:37:41,323
If we could dart him, w-we could get
him in a holding tank...

510
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:44,757
Hold it! This is crazy, this is nuts.

511
00:37:44,807 --> 00:37:47,401
White sharks are killers.
I know 'em.

512
00:37:47,447 --> 00:37:50,120
My father, my brother, myself.

513
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,362
They're murderers. No, Kay.

514
00:37:52,407 --> 00:37:56,844
Calvin, they die magnificently.

515
00:37:58,247 --> 00:37:59,805
(Laughs)

516
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:03,806
That would really be a spectacular
event. No doubt about that, huh?

517
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:10,445
What are we doing, Calvin,
planning a network special?

518
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:16,119
We could be the first people on the
planet to have a great white alive?

519
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:19,603
Not if my guv'nor
gets it first, miss.

520
00:38:19,647 --> 00:38:23,322
OK. Say he kills it.
Well, that's it.

521
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,756
It's one shot, over, gone.

522
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:30,278
But a live great white...
You think about that, Calvin!

523
00:38:30,327 --> 00:38:34,320
Nightly bulletins on the progress
of the killer shark.

524
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:37,040
Pictures of us nursing it
back to health

525
00:38:37,087 --> 00:38:39,521
and lowering it into a holding tank.

526
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,125
Now, that's world news!

527
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:43,362
Think of the lines at the gate.

528
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:46,080
Then you miss the sport of the kill.

529
00:38:46,127 --> 00:38:49,119
Now, wait up, Jack. Wait up.

530
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:51,806
(Philip) Killing is guaranteed press.

531
00:38:51,847 --> 00:38:54,964
But this other is much,
much more interesting.

532
00:38:55,007 --> 00:38:58,522
OK, this is MS-2-22.

533
00:38:58,567 --> 00:39:01,877
This is quinaldine, but I had to
guesstimate the dosage.

534
00:39:01,927 --> 00:39:05,203
- Kathy?
- Right. Thanks, Danny.

535
00:39:06,607 --> 00:39:09,440
All right, we're ready in Control.
You all set?

536
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:11,159
'We're ready down here.'

537
00:39:11,207 --> 00:39:13,516
(Kay clears throat)

538
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:15,637
With those TV monitors rolling,

539
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,918
you're gonna have more coverage
than a space launch.

540
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:20,685
Good. Just the way I like it.

541
00:39:20,727 --> 00:39:23,525
The colour of your wet suit's
one hell of a choice.

542
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:25,956
- The shark's gonna love you.
- Exactly.

543
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:29,124
- It helps me get the close-ups.
- You're the showman.

544
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,556
Honey, is this suit
gonna protect you?

545
00:39:31,607 --> 00:39:32,722
Have you felt...?

546
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:36,203
It won't bite through,
but it will yield to pressure.

547
00:39:36,247 --> 00:39:39,000
So she might just get
a little...squeeze.

548
00:39:39,047 --> 00:39:43,518
Oh, that's great news.
Look, why do you have to do this?

549
00:39:43,567 --> 00:39:47,276
Why don't you let Her Majesty's
number one son take care of it?

550
00:39:47,327 --> 00:39:49,318
Because it's my job, remember?

551
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:52,325
Yeah, but I just don't
want it to be you.

552
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:56,724
You build the stuff, I swim around
in it. That was the deal. Right?

553
00:39:56,767 --> 00:39:58,086
Hmm?

554
00:39:59,127 --> 00:40:00,958
I love you, too.

555
00:40:07,327 --> 00:40:11,320
If we get into any trouble,
all we have to do is pull the pin.

556
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,006
- What are those?
- (Jack) Mills bombs.

557
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:16,038
- What?
- Mills bombs, sonny.

558
00:40:16,087 --> 00:40:20,239
Grenades. A chap in Her Majesty's
ordinance makes them up for me.

559
00:40:20,287 --> 00:40:23,165
(Philip) 'Baby claymores.
Good dispersion.

560
00:40:23,207 --> 00:40:25,801
'Some concussion
but they do the trick.'

561
00:40:25,847 --> 00:40:28,407
Well, not in my water. Take 'em off.

562
00:40:28,447 --> 00:40:31,598
You tend to your knitting,
my dear, and I tend to mine.

563
00:40:31,647 --> 00:40:33,444
(Mike ) Hold on a second there.

564
00:40:33,487 --> 00:40:35,478
There's no explosives underwater.

565
00:40:35,527 --> 00:40:39,315
There's acrylic down there,
a very fragile environment. No bombs.

566
00:40:39,367 --> 00:40:41,403
(Philip) 'Brody, this is insur...'

567
00:40:41,447 --> 00:40:44,041
(Mike ) 'No, I don't think
you understood me!

568
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:48,842
'I built this park, and I'm not gonna
see some visiting fireman blow it up

569
00:40:48,887 --> 00:40:51,003
'because he wants to kill a fish!'

570
00:40:51,047 --> 00:40:55,040
Calvin, are you listening
to all this?

571
00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:57,920
No grenades.

572
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:03,443
For Christ's sake, guv'nor.
Remember Australia?

573
00:41:03,487 --> 00:41:08,242
Oh, don't worry, Jack.
After all, it's only a little fish.

574
00:41:08,287 --> 00:41:10,084
Son of a...

575
00:41:10,127 --> 00:41:12,277
The pin has to be pulled.

576
00:41:12,327 --> 00:41:17,355
Right. Get rid of this stuff.
Everybody aboard here? Let's go.

577
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:21,918
Shove off.

578
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:39,400
(Kay ) 'I need one clean belly shot.

579
00:41:39,447 --> 00:41:44,441
'If I miss, I'm gonna have to reload
and hope I get him with the second.'

580
00:41:44,487 --> 00:41:47,047
(Philip)
This is a good place to start.

581
00:41:49,847 --> 00:41:51,041
(Engines stop)

582
00:41:51,087 --> 00:41:53,362
(Mike ) Hit the lights.

583
00:41:56,367 --> 00:41:57,766
Shall we dance?

584
00:41:57,807 --> 00:42:02,164
Why not? I'm beginning to feel like
King Richard going to the Crusades.

585
00:42:07,607 --> 00:42:10,201
(Philip) Ready, Jack? Get the gear.

586
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:14,717
(Jack) Brown bread, guv'nor.

587
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:19,358
You all right?

588
00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:21,318
Good luck.

589
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:12,526
You only get one shot.

590
00:43:12,567 --> 00:43:14,558
(Mike ) Yeah, I know. I know.

591
00:43:15,607 --> 00:43:17,245
(Mike exhales)

592
00:43:17,287 --> 00:43:19,960
What about Kathryn?

593
00:43:20,007 --> 00:43:24,125
It'll stick in the shark.
Hit her, and it'll go right through.

594
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:27,079
Just buoy him up,
slow him down, right?

595
00:43:28,447 --> 00:43:30,483
Dorsal fin, middle of the back.

596
00:43:35,967 --> 00:43:37,958
Seen anything yet?

597
00:43:38,007 --> 00:43:40,680
We'll get him on the monitors.

598
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:01,876
(Kay grunting)

599
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:04,805
(Kay screams)

600
00:44:25,367 --> 00:44:28,837
Quick! Mike, He's making a run!

601
00:44:31,007 --> 00:44:32,918
Quick, shoot him!

602
00:44:32,967 --> 00:44:34,798
(Philip) He's getting away!

603
00:44:34,847 --> 00:44:36,565
Damn it!

604
00:44:39,767 --> 00:44:41,837
(Mike ) Get outta the way, Kay!

605
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,400
(Kay ) Now!

606
00:45:06,367 --> 00:45:08,278
Come on.

607
00:45:08,327 --> 00:45:10,443
Right. There you go.

608
00:45:10,487 --> 00:45:12,478
You did it, baby.

609
00:45:12,527 --> 00:45:14,643
Here's the ladder. Hold on.

610
00:45:14,687 --> 00:45:16,484
Come on. Give me your fins.

611
00:45:16,527 --> 00:45:19,724
- Give me your fins.
- Let's go!

612
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:21,359
(Dan) Up you go.

613
00:45:22,647 --> 00:45:25,002
You all right?

614
00:45:26,407 --> 00:45:27,806
(Gasps)

615
00:45:27,847 --> 00:45:30,441
- Close one.
- (Mike ) Get this stuff off her.

616
00:45:30,487 --> 00:45:33,877
- (Liz) That was great!
- What am I, a bloody porter?

617
00:45:33,927 --> 00:45:36,964
- How about a hand with this?
- First things first.

618
00:45:37,007 --> 00:45:40,124
- Mustn't ignore the ladies.
- Don't ignore the help.

619
00:45:40,167 --> 00:45:44,001
(Mike ) Looked hairy down there.
(Liz) You OK? I was worried.

620
00:45:44,047 --> 00:45:46,800
You sure know how
to scare the hell outta me.

621
00:45:46,847 --> 00:45:51,318
Be sure he's wrapped, OK? Keep him
wet. Let's get him in a tank.

622
00:45:51,367 --> 00:45:56,441
(Calvin) 'Film all right?
TV picture looked cloudy.'

623
00:45:56,487 --> 00:46:00,719
Calvin. Kathryn's fine,

00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:37,437
(People laughing, chattering)

780
00:55:37,487 --> 00:55:39,796
Go! Go! Get away! Get away!

781
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:52,596
(PA) 'We invite you to enter
the magical world of the Coral Forest

782
00:55:52,647 --> 00:55:56,799
'where you may observe the wonders
of the deep without ever getting wet.

783
00:55:56,847 --> 00:56:00,283
'The Spanish Galleon plays host
to many colourful fish

784
00:56:00,327 --> 00:56:04,286
'that we have assembled from
the different oceans of the world.'

785
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:09,517
- Look at all of them!
- Oh, yeah!

786
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:13,879
(Girl) That looks like a butterfly.
(2nd Girl) You're right.

787
00:56:22,287 --> 00:56:24,278
(Man) Oh, my God! Look at that!

788
00:56:29,367 --> 00:56:31,403
Kay, you don't want to see this.

789
00:56:31,447 --> 00:56:34,484
Everybody is assuming
this was a shark attack.

790
00:56:34,527 --> 00:56:37,485
- Now, I wanna make sure.
- OK. All right.

791
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:39,518
Did you guys pull him out?

792
00:57:08,287 --> 00:57:10,721
(Mike gasps)

793
00:57:13,367 --> 00:57:15,085
That's Shelby Overman.

794
00:57:20,287 --> 00:57:22,039
- Kay, I told...
- Miss...

795
00:57:22,087 --> 00:57:23,805
Mike. Ray.

796
00:57:25,047 --> 00:57:29,279
If this was a shark attack,
I've seen it before.

797
00:57:30,487 --> 00:57:32,045
OK?

798
00:57:42,447 --> 00:57:44,278
Oh, Mike.

799
00:57:45,567 --> 00:57:47,398
Oh, my God!

800
00:57:49,847 --> 00:57:52,315
Let's go find Calvin.
Come on! Come on!

801
00:57:52,367 --> 00:57:56,360
(Man) I'm getting contradictory
readings from the filtration pumps.

802
00:57:56,407 --> 00:57:59,683
(Leonard) Such as?
- High pump rate, low outflow

803
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:02,924
and a pressure build-up
on the inboard tunnel valve.

804
00:58:02,967 --> 00:58:06,323
- That's number two.
- Could be an obstruction.

805
00:58:06,367 --> 00:58:08,358
Well, that's not my department.

806
00:58:08,407 --> 00:58:10,716
See if you can locate
Brody or Calvin.

807
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:14,282
- (Calvin) Very posh.
- Yes, it's quite a display.

808
00:58:14,327 --> 00:58:18,036
Tell me. How do you contain the
sharks in this part of the lagoon?

809
00:58:18,087 --> 00:58:20,965
It's that old shark screen,
that bubble screen.

810
00:58:21,007 --> 00:58:23,362
You know, sharks don't like that.

811
00:58:23,407 --> 00:58:27,002
It's what they call, uh...
marine segregation.

812
00:58:27,047 --> 00:58:29,436
Dr Bouchard. Telephone.

813
00:58:29,487 --> 00:58:32,559
Ah, excuse me, gentlemen.
Be comfortable now.

814
00:58:33,567 --> 00:58:35,080
Here you go, sir.

815
00:58:36,207 --> 00:58:38,004
Bouchard here.

816
00:58:39,527 --> 00:58:41,916
What about the pumps?

817
00:58:41,967 --> 00:58:45,403
Ah, nah, nah, nah.
Don't wait for Brody.

818
00:58:45,447 --> 00:58:49,645
Just, uh... shut down number two pump
and switch over to number one.

819
00:58:49,687 --> 00:58:51,564
Simple as that.

820
00:58:51,607 --> 00:58:55,395
Because it costs too much to replace
and they burn out!

821
00:58:55,447 --> 00:58:59,599
Tell Brody to get down here
to the Neptune Room on the double!

822
00:59:00,727 --> 00:59:03,082
- Thank you.
- (Man) You're welcome.

823
00:59:13,207 --> 00:59:14,845
Well, gentlemen.

824
00:59:14,887 --> 00:59:16,479
Chin-chin.

825
00:59:16,527 --> 00:59:20,042
- Oh, cheers.
- Cheers.

826
00:59:20,127 --> 00:59:22,038
(Kay ) There they are.

827
00:59:23,687 --> 00:59:27,919
- Calvin, I've got bad news.
- Keep your voices down, sit down.

828
00:59:29,127 --> 00:59:31,004
Sit down!

829
00:59:31,087 --> 00:59:32,998
Was it the shark?

830
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:39,396
It was a shark.

831
00:59:39,447 --> 00:59:41,881
It was a shark...

832
00:59:41,927 --> 00:59:45,124
with a bite radius
about a yard across.

833
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:49,524
Don't be silly. That would indicate
a shark of some 35 feet in length.

834
00:59:49,567 --> 00:59:51,444
You said it exactly.

835
00:59:56,487 --> 00:59:59,559
- Our shark still has all its teeth.
- Yeah.

836
00:59:59,607 --> 01:00:01,518
That means it was a baby.

837
01:00:01,567 --> 01:00:05,355
Our shark couldn't
have killed Overman.

838
01:00:05,407 --> 01:00:07,318
Its mother did.

839
01:00:07,367 --> 01:00:09,881
You talkin' about
some damn shark's mother?

840
01:00:09,927 --> 01:00:11,883
Don't you hear what she's sayin'?

841
01:00:11,927 --> 01:00:13,201
I'm listening!

842
01:00:13,247 --> 01:00:16,319
Well, she gave birth way out to sea,
and the baby swam

843
01:00:16,407 --> 01:00:19,365
through the sea gate
that you left open, Brody!

844
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:23,798
No! Overman was killed
inside the park.

845
01:00:23,847 --> 01:00:27,203
The baby was caught
inside the park.

846
01:00:27,247 --> 01:00:30,717
Its mother is inside the park.

847
01:00:43,487 --> 01:00:46,684
(Echoing) She's right there!

848
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:48,877
(Screaming)

849
01:00:54,527 --> 01:00:56,995
(Woman) How did that thing
get in there?

850
01:00:57,047 --> 01:01:00,596
- The animals are in the lagoon!
- Ski show!

851
01:01:00,647 --> 01:01:03,445
Control, this is Bouchard.
Listen carefully!

852
01:01:03,487 --> 01:01:07,605
Clear the tunnel, let the people out,
close the gate and seal the park!

853
01:01:07,647 --> 01:01:10,002
Seal the park!
I'll be down in a minute.

854
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:14,958
(Man) Hey! Hey! Watch it!

855
01:01:15,007 --> 01:01:17,965
(Woman) Who is that guy?
(Man) Watch out!

856
01:01:28,767 --> 01:01:32,043
Hey, bring it over here! Hey!

857
01:01:38,527 --> 01:01:41,644
All right. I've had enough fun.
Let's go in now.

858
01:01:41,687 --> 01:01:43,643
Come on. You're enjoying this.

859
01:01:43,687 --> 01:01:46,963
No. Look, don't you
have to be at work or something?

860
01:01:47,007 --> 01:01:49,805
I don't have to be back
till the second half.

861
01:01:49,847 --> 01:01:51,803
- Oh.
- Come on.

862
01:01:53,807 --> 01:01:54,956
Gotcha, lovers.

863
01:01:55,007 --> 01:01:56,235
- Shit!
- God.

864
01:01:58,287 --> 01:02:00,437
- Get out! Get out!
- Hey, what the...?!

865
01:02:00,487 --> 01:02:02,603
Hey, what are ya doin'?!

866
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:05,035
Brody!

867
01:02:05,087 --> 01:02:07,123
Get out of the water. Get out!

868
01:02:07,167 --> 01:02:10,682
Get out of the water, please.
Please, come in from the water.

869
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:14,356
Out of the water! Come on!
Get out of the water!

870
01:02:15,207 --> 01:02:17,038

Get outta the way!

873
01:02:29,327 --> 01:02:30,919
Shit!

874
01:02:37,367 --> 01:02:39,562
(Man) This is Sea World Control.

875
01:02:40,687 --> 01:02:42,723
Uh-huh.

876
01:02:42,767 --> 01:02:45,042
Yes. I got him right here.

877
01:02:49,527 --> 01:02:51,961
(PA) 'All right, boys.
Come take a bow.

878
01:02:52,007 --> 01:02:56,319
'I apologise to have you...
No! Get up here!'

879
01:02:56,367 --> 01:02:59,006
Get outta the water!
Get outta the water!

880
01:02:59,087 --> 01:03:00,964
(Announcer) Boys. Boys!

881

Bring the boat in!
Get outta the water!

882

Bring the boat in!
Get outta the water now!

889
01:03:19,687 --> 01:03:22,520
Ready, up! One. Two.

01:03:23,807 --> 01:03:27,163
Bring that boat in!
Get outta the water right now!

891
01:03:27,207 --> 01:03:30,005
Hey, get me down! Just get me down!

892
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,322
- Get me down!
- What are you saying?

893
01:03:32,407 --> 01:03:34,921
There's something back there!
A shark!

894
01:03:34,967 --> 01:03:37,117
Bring your boat in!

895
01:03:43,247 --> 01:03:44,805
There's a shark!

896
01:03:44,847 --> 01:03:46,803
(Audience screaming)

897
01:03:52,367 --> 01:03:54,119
(Screaming continues)

898
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:56,123
(Brody on PA) Get outta the water!

899
01:03:56,167 --> 01:03:59,557
(Girls) One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

900
01:03:59,607 --> 01:04:03,122
- Get out!
- Up. Turn.

901
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:08,158
Oh, my God! Shark!

902
01:04:14,607 --> 01:04:16,837
(Brody ) Get outta the water!

903
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:20,675
(Man in boat)
We're coming! We're coming!

904
01:04:20,727 --> 01:04:22,638
It's gonna eat us!

905
01:04:22,687 --> 01:04:24,120
They'll die!

906
01:04:26,887 --> 01:04:29,560
- Gimme your hand. Come on!
- Pull me out!

907
01:04:33,527 --> 01:04:35,006
Hang on!

908
01:04:41,007 --> 01:04:43,805
(Sean) Needs a choke or something.
Pull it.

909
01:04:45,327 --> 01:04:46,965
(Both gasp)

910
01:04:56,927 --> 01:04:58,519
(Sean) Hold my hand.

911
01:05:00,127 --> 01:05:01,958
(Sean) Kelly!

912
01:05:02,007 --> 01:05:03,838
Shark!

913
01:05:03,887 --> 01:05:05,479
Kelly!

914
01:05:10,647 --> 01:05:12,160
Kelly!

915
01:05:19,607 --> 01:05:22,075
- What the hell is that?
- Shit! Hang on!

916
01:05:38,007 --> 01:05:39,565
(Girl) What happened?

917
01:05:39,607 --> 01:05:42,201
(Girl) She's drowning!
She's drowning!

918
01:05:42,247 --> 01:05:45,603
Swim! Swim, kid, swim!

919
01:05:48,247 --> 01:05:50,477
(People gasping)

920
01:05:56,647 --> 01:05:58,558
(Philip) Call an ambulance.

921
01:05:58,607 --> 01:06:01,041
Quickly. Come on.
Get out of the way!

922
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,759
Get a paramedic!

923
01:06:04,247 --> 01:06:06,078
Look out, Mommy!

924
01:06:12,327 --> 01:06:16,002
- Did you call an ambulance?
- Yeah, the paramedics.

925
01:06:16,047 --> 01:06:20,245
(Mike ) Twist that tourniquet tight
and hold it there.

926
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:22,118
(Sean) I'm here. You're OK.

927
01:06:22,167 --> 01:06:26,126
(Man) They're bringin' in the
wounded. The ambulance is on the way.

928
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:29,637
Shall I leave the gate open?
Cindy and Sandy are out there.

929
01:06:29,687 --> 01:06:31,200
Shit.

930
01:06:32,647 --> 01:06:35,207
No. They'll have to
take care of themselves.

931
01:06:35,247 --> 01:06:38,045
We can't take our chance
on that big bitch gettin' in.

932
01:06:40,607 --> 01:06:43,041
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah. Fine.

933
01:06:43,087 --> 01:06:45,726
Uh, I'm gonna go with Kelly.

934
01:06:45,767 --> 01:06:48,076
I think you should.

935
01:06:48,127 --> 01:06:51,563
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

936
01:06:55,807 --> 01:06:59,436
Hello out there.
This is Calvin Bouchard.

937
01:06:59,487 --> 01:07:02,365
May I please
have your kind attention.

938
01:07:02,407 --> 01:07:04,443
Due to technical difficulties,

939
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:07,718
it has become necessary for us
to temporarily close

940
01:07:07,767 --> 01:07:10,235
the Undersea Kingdom now.

941
01:07:10,287 --> 01:07:13,996
For those of you all still in
the underwater portion of this park,

942
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:18,563
please follow your guides,
and they will point out

943
01:07:18,607 --> 01:07:21,360
the most convenient
and accessible exits.

944
01:07:21,407 --> 01:07:25,480
Where the hell is the nearest
accessible exit? We're underwater!

945
01:07:25,527 --> 01:07:27,324
- Is this off?
- Uh-huh.

946
01:07:27,367 --> 01:07:29,961
- Gimme some lights down there!
- OK.

947
01:07:30,007 --> 01:07:33,716
Can't see shit down there!
Get me some medical attention, quick!

948
01:07:33,767 --> 01:07:36,804
OK, ladies and gentlemen,
please follow me

949
01:07:36,847 --> 01:07:40,886
in an orderly fashion, and remember -
walk, do not run.

950
01:07:45,447 --> 01:07:48,917
Daddy, Daddy! Look at the fish!

951
01:07:48,967 --> 01:07:51,197
- Look!
- Holy shit!

952
01:07:51,247 --> 01:07:53,203
(Panicked screams)

953
01:07:55,967 --> 01:07:58,925
(Screaming)

954
01:08:10,487 --> 01:08:12,478
(Technician) Tunnel six failure.

955
01:08:14,087 --> 01:08:15,918
It's Jonah and the Whale.

956
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:20,438
Tube integrity has been compromised.
We've got leakage and pressure loss.

957
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:27,643
We have to seal the section
or we'll lose the whole complex.

958
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:30,565
- Watertight doors. Hit it.
- On automatic.

959
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:34,486
They're all on go status.
Activated. Now!

960
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,085
(People screaming)

961
01:08:41,167 --> 01:08:42,998
I need my wallet!

962
01:08:44,007 --> 01:08:45,804
(Screaming continues)

963
01:09:10,167 --> 01:09:12,727
Quiet! Quiet! Please!

964
01:09:13,887 --> 01:09:16,276
I need your attention, please. Quiet!

965
01:09:16,327 --> 01:09:20,002
Now the water is not going
any higher, so calm down, OK?

966
01:09:20,047 --> 01:09:22,641
It's stopped.
It's stopped, so calm down.

967
01:09:25,247 --> 01:09:28,364
(Guide ) 'The oxygen that we have
in here is all we have,

968
01:09:28,407 --> 01:09:32,320
'so let's not panic, but let's try
to take shallow breaths, OK?'

969
01:09:47,127 --> 01:09:48,845
- Hey, Mike.
- Yeah!

970
01:09:48,887 --> 01:09:52,357
This is our last cut. I think
our tunnel patch is ready to go.

971
01:09:52,407 --> 01:09:55,205
Good. Rig the winch
on that work boat up there.

972
01:09:55,247 --> 01:09:56,885
You got it.

973
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:01,121
- How much longer, sweetie?
- I don't know.

974
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:02,282
No?

975
01:10:02,327 --> 01:10:05,683
We're gonna have to nudge these
tunnel sections together.

976
01:10:05,727 --> 01:10:08,366
Then we'll patch it
and weld the whole thing.

977
01:10:08,407 --> 01:10:09,556
Then we evacuate?

978
01:10:09,607 --> 01:10:12,440
No, then we put pressure back
into the tunnels,

979
01:10:12,487 --> 01:10:16,196
then the watertight doors
will open up, then people go home.

980
01:10:16,247 --> 01:10:19,478
Hey, watch how you're
cuttin' that. It's critical!

981
01:10:19,527 --> 01:10:22,246
Relax.
You're doin' everything you can.

982
01:10:22,287 --> 01:10:24,243
Come on. Come over here.

983
01:10:26,647 --> 01:10:28,638
Listen.

984
01:10:28,687 --> 01:10:30,678
I've been thinking.

985
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:35,039
Maybe Venezuela
can use some trained whales.

986
01:10:35,087 --> 01:10:37,282
- What? Are you serious?
- Yeah.

987
01:10:37,327 --> 01:10:38,760
I think this one's on me.

988
01:10:38,807 --> 01:10:41,605
- But next year...
- I'll follow you anywhere.

989
01:10:41,647 --> 01:10:43,126
- Yeah!
- I love you!

990
01:10:43,167 --> 01:10:45,158
(Chattering)

991
01:10:49,647 --> 01:10:51,239
Ah, Mr Glass.

992
01:10:51,287 --> 01:10:53,482
Is Mr Bouchard going to be here?

993
01:10:53,527 --> 01:10:56,405
Please, please.
I have a statement to make.

994
01:10:56,447 --> 01:10:59,564
- Was there an explosion?
- How many people are missing?

995
01:10:59,607 --> 01:11:02,121
Late today,
due to a minor disturbance,

996
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:05,364
there was a pressure failure
in one of the tunnels -

997
01:11:05,407 --> 01:11:07,363
a major attraction at the park.

998
01:11:07,407 --> 01:11:10,240
We estimate that 30 to 40 people

999
01:11:10,287 --> 01:11:12,960
were in the process
of being evacuated

1000
01:11:13,007 --> 01:11:17,364
when the watertight safety doors
temporarily delayed their exit.

1001
01:11:17,407 --> 01:11:20,080
We're working right now
to release them

1002
01:11:20,127 --> 01:11:22,687
under the safest
possible circumstances.

1003
01:11:22,727 --> 01:11:25,844
Seven visitors were also injured
in our beach area.

1004
01:11:25,887 --> 01:11:29,163
- That's all. Give me a break.
- What about a shark?

1005
01:11:29,207 --> 01:11:32,836
- I'll let you know as I know more.
- A very large shark...

1006
01:11:32,887 --> 01:11:35,481
That's all. There is no more.

1007
01:11:35,527 --> 01:11:37,358
(Woman) When will this be fixed?

1008
01:11:37,407 --> 01:11:39,967
(Guide )
I'm sure they're working on it.

1009
01:11:40,007 --> 01:11:43,238
Stay together to keep warm.
I know you're cold.

1010
01:11:43,287 --> 01:11:48,315
Stay together, take shallow breaths
and concentrate on your breathing.

1011
01:12:04,847 --> 01:12:07,122
Well, any sign of mother?

1012
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,675
OK, then.

1013
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:13,276
Where did the animal
hide the first time?

1014
01:12:14,807 --> 01:12:16,081
Uh...

1015
01:12:17,847 --> 01:12:19,963
filtration pipe.

1016
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:21,918
Opposite side of the lagoon.

1017
01:12:21,967 --> 01:12:26,438
Brody, is there an access hatch,
a backwash gate?

1018
01:12:27,447 --> 01:12:32,282
Heavy grillwork. Keeps the pumps
clear when we back-flush that system.

1019
01:12:32,327 --> 01:12:35,524
Why? What do you want to do?
Get that thing back in?

1020
01:12:35,567 --> 01:12:37,444
He's a bright lad.

1021
01:12:37,487 --> 01:12:42,038
Yes. Jack and I are going to lure him
back into the pipe,

1022
01:12:42,087 --> 01:12:45,921
close the gates and then dispose
of him at our leisure.

1023
01:12:45,967 --> 01:12:50,085
Meanwhile, you can weld your patch
and then evacuate the civilians.

1024
01:12:50,127 --> 01:12:53,278
What if she doesn't want
to go back in?

1025
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:57,445
I think we can pretty much
guarantee she'll want to go back in.

1026
01:12:57,487 --> 01:12:59,557
- Right, Jack?
- Sure.

1027
01:12:59,607 --> 01:13:02,167
Just how are you
going to guarantee that?

1028
01:13:03,727 --> 01:13:05,638
Live bait.

1029
01:13:05,687 --> 01:13:09,157
(Man) We're ready to move
out over the tunnel now.

1030
01:13:09,207 --> 01:13:11,084
(Mike ) Let's go.

1031
01:13:21,287 --> 01:13:23,323
I-I'll be in the Control Room.

1032
01:13:23,367 --> 01:13:25,801
I'll go with you.

1033
01:13:27,367 --> 01:13:30,040
(Man) Give me that.
I'll store it over here.

1034
01:13:30,087 --> 01:13:31,076
(Man) No, I got it. I got it.

1035
01:13:33,647 --> 01:13:34,716
(Technician)
Yeah, we're on top of it.

1036
01:13:34,767 --> 01:13:36,803
OK. Thanks.

1037
01:13:44,727 --> 01:13:46,638
Now, where's that damn fish?

1038
01:13:49,287 --> 01:13:51,164
There. I've got him.

1039
01:13:51,207 --> 01:13:53,641
(Technician)
Sorry, it's the dolphins.

1040
01:13:56,287 --> 01:13:58,881
Babies, stay out of it, please.

1041
01:13:58,927 --> 01:14:01,760
..and I've rigged a lifeline.

1042
01:14:01,807 --> 01:14:05,766
Just let the pumps push you out and
use the rope to pull yourself back.

1043
01:14:05,807 --> 01:14:07,126
Right.

1044
01:14:08,447 --> 01:14:11,917
And why don't I do all the filming?

1045
01:14:11,967 --> 01:14:15,721
I want both cameras.
We need the coverage. Come on, Jack!

1046
01:14:15,767 --> 01:14:17,644
This isn't a picnic.

1047
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:21,521
This film is a bloody
retirement annuity.

1048
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:24,286
I'd feel better
if you did just the one thing.

1049
01:14:24,327 --> 01:14:26,204
(Laughs) What's the matter?

1050
01:14:26,247 --> 01:14:28,158
Getting cold feet?

1051
01:14:29,007 --> 01:14:31,840
OK, Bob. Hold it about right there.

1052
01:14:31,887 --> 01:14:35,197
- We're right over the tunnel.
- OK, we're all set.

1053
01:14:35,247 --> 01:14:37,920
(Mike )
'Tell FitzRoyce we're in position.'

1054
01:14:37,967 --> 01:14:40,003
FitzRoyce, you can go now.

1055
01:15:04,207 --> 01:15:08,564
(Technician) They're testing
the lifeline to see if it's secure.

1056
01:15:27,647 --> 01:15:31,526
(Calvin) 'They're spreadin' some
chum. You know, fish oil and blood.

1057
01:15:31,567 --> 01:15:34,365
'Then Jack's gonna make
some metallic sounds

1058
01:15:34,407 --> 01:15:37,683
'to attract her right down
into that filtration pipe.'

1059
01:15:37,727 --> 01:15:39,479
Start the pumps.

1060
01:15:39,527 --> 01:15:41,563
(Woman technician) You got it.

1061
01:15:46,567 --> 01:15:49,161
(Metal clanging)

1062
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:08,799
(Clanging)

1063
01:17:07,287 --> 01:17:10,723
(Technician) It's in!
(Calvin) He's got it!

1064
01:17:10,767 --> 01:17:12,598
All right. It's locked.

1065
01:17:14,727 --> 01:17:16,763
It's safe, Brody. Go for it.

1066
01:17:16,807 --> 01:17:18,638
OK, let's go.

1067
01:18:08,407 --> 01:18:09,806
(Muffled scream)

1068
01:18:42,647 --> 01:18:45,844
(Technician) 'This is Control.
Is that patch in place?'

1069
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:47,559
Easy.

1070
01:18:57,047 --> 01:18:59,641
Let me help you with that,
Dr Morgan.

1071
01:18:59,687 --> 01:19:01,518
Got it!

1072
01:19:03,727 --> 01:19:05,763
Now weld the son-of-a-bitch...

1073
01:19:06,967 --> 01:19:09,401
Kathryn, what are you doin'?

1074
01:19:09,447 --> 01:19:11,278
I'm going down there.

1075
01:19:14,407 --> 01:19:15,442
You crazy?

1076
01:19:15,487 --> 01:19:17,955
He needs eyes
in the back of his head.

1077
01:19:22,767 --> 01:19:24,962
- Thanks, Fred.
- All right.

1078
01:19:25,007 --> 01:19:27,077
Watch the tanks.

1079
01:19:27,127 --> 01:19:28,685
OK.

1080
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:34,362
- Here are your fins.
- Thanks.

1081
01:19:34,407 --> 01:19:36,762
Be careful down there now.

1082
01:19:51,007 --> 01:19:53,157
(Hinges creaking)

1083
01:20:21,287 --> 01:20:23,118
(Sighs) You all right?

1084
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:25,998
Where's Mr FitzRoyce?

1085
01:20:26,047 --> 01:20:27,924
I have no idea.

1086
01:20:31,247 --> 01:20:32,805
(Man) What's goin' on?

1087
01:20:35,367 --> 01:20:36,516
Guv'nor!

1088
01:20:36,767 --> 01:20:38,485
Guv'nor!

1089
01:20:38,727 --> 01:20:41,241
Guv'nor!

1090
01:20:41,327 --> 01:20:42,965
There's no other way out?

1091
01:20:43,007 --> 01:20:45,157
You don't understand. This is it!

1092
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:47,084
Have you looked?

1093
01:20:47,127 --> 01:20:49,800
He didn't come up.

1094
01:20:49,847 --> 01:20:53,123
Guv'nor, you bloody bastard.
Answer me!

1095
01:20:59,247 --> 01:21:02,045
We'll suffocate the bitch.
Shut down the pumps.

1096
01:21:02,087 --> 01:21:03,315
Are you sure?

1097
01:21:03,367 --> 01:21:06,404
- Why don't we blow it up?
- Listen, nephew.

1098
01:21:06,447 --> 01:21:10,360
A $2.5 million turbine's not going up
in smoke cos of a damn fish!

1099
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:12,921
Now shut the pumps down!

1100
01:21:14,247 --> 01:21:16,442
(Mechanical whirring)

1101
01:21:16,487 --> 01:21:18,717
What's happened?

1102
01:21:18,767 --> 01:21:21,156
(Man) They've shut the pumps off.

1103
01:21:21,207 --> 01:21:25,837
(Sighs) That's all she needs.
The gates can't hold much longer.

1104
01:21:27,847 --> 01:21:31,760
(Sobbing) Philip, pull the pin!
Pull the pin, Philip.

1105
01:21:56,847 --> 01:21:59,520
(Metallic clanking on monitor)

1106
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:07,801
(Clanking)

1107
01:22:30,567 --> 01:22:34,640
(Clanking continues)

1108
01:22:51,087 --> 01:22:52,725
(Woman) Look at that!

1109
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:02,080
(Woman) Jesus!

1110
01:23:02,127 --> 01:23:04,083
(Man) Oh, my God!

1111
01:23:04,167 --> 01:23:06,397
We gotta warn 'em.
We gotta tell 'em!

1112
01:23:06,447 --> 01:23:09,200
Get 'em up! It's coming back.
Get 'em up quick!

1113
01:23:09,247 --> 01:23:11,317
- Come on! Hurry up!
- Come on!

1114
01:23:11,367 --> 01:23:13,437
Get 'em up!

1115
01:23:25,927 --> 01:23:28,043
- Come on, Mike.
- Get out of there!

1116
01:23:34,447 --> 01:23:37,439
- Come on, Mike!
- (Calvin) 'Get 'em up!'

1117
01:24:05,087 --> 01:24:07,237
(Muffled) Come on!

1118
01:24:14,767 --> 01:24:16,837
(Squeaking)

1119
01:24:21,927 --> 01:24:23,758
(Squeaking)

1120
01:25:15,287 --> 01:25:17,005
(Muffled) Pull the door!

1121
01:25:45,087 --> 01:25:47,760
How the hell did it get loose?

1122
01:25:52,047 --> 01:25:54,402
Open the hatch!

1123
01:25:58,247 --> 01:26:01,000
(Fred) Come on up, Mike. I gotcha.

1124
01:26:06,167 --> 01:26:08,442
Are you all right?

1125
01:26:08,487 --> 01:26:11,081
Do we have pressure
in those tunnels yet?

1126
01:26:11,127 --> 01:26:14,085
- Affirmative.
- Then get those people out.

1127
01:26:16,647 --> 01:26:19,445
Feel the air!
Can you feel the air?

1128
01:26:19,487 --> 01:26:22,320
The water's going down.
The water's going down!

1129
01:26:26,927 --> 01:26:29,600
Try to be calm.
Don't rush to the door.

1130
01:26:40,207 --> 01:26:42,038
(Man) We're saved!

1131
01:26:42,087 --> 01:26:44,123
(All talking and cheering)

1132
01:27:43,367 --> 01:27:46,086
(Muffled yelling, crunching)

1133
01:29:53,487 --> 01:29:55,318
Oh! We did it!

1134
01:29:55,367 --> 01:29:57,927
The others, Mike.
What about the others?

1135
01:29:57,967 --> 01:29:59,958
Calvin made it. Lisa.

1136
01:30:00,007 --> 01:30:03,397
Mike. Mike! The dolphins!

1137
01:30:04,487 --> 01:30:05,886
(Kay ) Cindy!

1138
01:30:05,927 --> 01:30:08,236
(Mike ) Cindy!
(Kay ) Sandy!

1139
01:30:08,287 --> 01:30:11,677
- Come on! Cindy!
- Cindy!

1140
01:30:11,727 --> 01:30:14,764
Oh, good girl. Sandy!

1141
01:30:14,807 --> 01:30:16,035
(Squeaks)

1142
01:30:16,087 --> 01:30:20,842
Sandy, come on, baby.
Sandy, where are you?

1143
01:30:20,887 --> 01:30:22,718
(Mike ) Sandy!

1144
01:30:23,927 --> 01:30:25,758
I hope she made it.

1145
01:30:27,687 --> 01:30:29,518
- Cindy, stay.
- Sandy.

1146
01:30:29,567 --> 01:30:31,444
(Squeaks)

1147
01:30:32,967 --> 01:30:35,242
Sandy!

1148
01:30:35,287 --> 01:30:37,437
All right!

1149
01:30:48,767 --> 01:30:50,598
All right!

1150
