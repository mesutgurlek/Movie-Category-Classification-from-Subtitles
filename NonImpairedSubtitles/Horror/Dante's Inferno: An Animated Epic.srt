1
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,399
<i>At the midpoint on the journey of life,</i>

2
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,918
<i>I found myself in a dark forest,</i>

3
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,839
<i>for the clear path was lost.</i>

4
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:48,878
<i>I cannot well recount
how I entered the wood,</i>

5
00:00:48,998 --> 00:00:52,677
<i>so long had it been
since I abandoned the true way.</i>

6
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:57,316
<i>How shall I say what a dreary
and horrid wood it was?</i>

7
00:00:57,437 --> 00:01:01,515
<i>So bitter to endurw that death itself
would be but little worse.</i>

8
00:01:05,077 --> 00:01:06,915
<i>Several times upon my journey home,</i>

9
00:01:07,037 --> 00:01:10,035
<i>I had sensed an unseen rider
trailing my steed.</i>

10
00:01:10,156 --> 00:01:13,316
<i>Yet, when I approached, the rider vanished,</i>

11
00:01:14,476 --> 00:01:16,354
<i>leaving no trace.</i>

12
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:20,033
<i>I feared this figure as an evil omen.</i>

13
00:01:20,156 --> 00:01:23,994
<i>All my life I've known such signs
and portents.</i>

14
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:32,232
<i>And lo, at the rise of the hill,
I saw a spotted leopard,</i>

15
00:01:32,354 --> 00:01:34,352
<i>all teeth and fury.</i>

16
00:01:35,393 --> 00:01:37,792
<i>At the sight of these beasts,
my heart sank.</i>

17
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:41,273
<i>I sensed danger not for myself,
but for my beloved Beatrice.</i>

18
00:01:43,832 --> 00:01:45,512
<i>Away, demon!</i>

19
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:58,790
<i>I drove my steed on,
racing for my father's villa.</i>

20
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,630
<i>And Beatrice... nothing in this world
meant more to me than she.</i>

21
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:04,909
You were right, Dante.

22
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,430
Truly this is a divine place.
Paradise on Earth.

23
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,508
Beatrice, will you take my hand in marriage,

24
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:13,708
under God and all that is holy?

25
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:18,908
Dante, I will not marry you
only to see you dead in this crusade.

26
00:02:19,028 --> 00:02:21,787
Jerusalem must be made Christian
once more.

27
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,947
God is with us. We cannot fail.

28
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,547
Through three years of war and horror,

29
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:31,386
my love for Beatrice
had only grown stronger.

30
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:36,506
As I came upon the family estate,

31
00:02:36,627 --> 00:02:39,545
I found all unnaturally dark and still.

32
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:47,024
Fearing the dreaded omens, I entered.

33
00:02:58,225 --> 00:03:00,823
The servants. All butchered.

34
00:03:10,502 --> 00:03:13,381
Father. Oh, Father.

35
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:17,661
Beatrice! Lord, let her be alive!

36
00:03:20,862 --> 00:03:22,860
In the name of God.

37
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:26,539
Where is...

38
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:28,459
Oh, no. No.

39
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,499
Beloved, are you all right?

40
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:36,299
Beatrice.

41
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:39,858
Is it you or a dream?

42
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,417
Who did this to you?

43
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:43,938
I know not.

44
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:47,097
A stranger. A foreigner.

45
00:03:49,298 --> 00:03:53,776
Do you remember that night
before you left?

46
00:03:53,897 --> 00:03:55,055
What we said?

47
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:56,176
I remember.

48
00:03:56,296 --> 00:03:59,856
Did you betray me?

49
00:04:02,297 --> 00:04:04,015
Never.

50
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:15,015
I never should have left your side.

51
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:16,935
Forgive me.

52
00:04:20,856 --> 00:04:22,852
What?

53
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:28,974
Do my eyes deceive me?

54
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:32,972
Fear not for me, my love.
I told him you would be true to me.

55
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:35,732
I knew you would.

56
00:04:40,212 --> 00:04:42,931
No! Wait! Come back to me!

57
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,651
What is this?

58
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,609
God in Heaven!

59
00:04:52,732 --> 00:04:54,569
What? Dante?

60
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,050
She is mine.

61
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,769
No!

62
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,169
I have come to take
what was promised me...

63
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:07,008
a soul meant for Heaven.

64
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:09,087
It can't be true.

65
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:11,208
Dante would never betray me.

66
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:13,607
Beatrice!

67
00:05:13,728 --> 00:05:15,648
Release her, devil!

68
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:27,806
Dante, help me!

69
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:30,365
No!

70
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:43,523
This will not stop me!
Nothing will stop me!

71
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:49,883
No!

72
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:01,202
What?

73
00:06:01,322 --> 00:06:02,963
No!

74
00:06:03,084 --> 00:06:05,522
God, give me strength!

75
00:06:08,162 --> 00:06:12,121
Come with me, mortal,
if you have the courage.

76
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:15,320
Dante, don't let him take me!

77
00:06:16,082 --> 00:06:17,760
Beatrice!

78
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,759
You will not keep me from my beloved!

79
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,399
Dante, you lied to me! I trusted you!

80
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,317
You've got to save me! Dante!

81
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,558
I'm coming for you!
I won't let him hurt you!

82
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:50,597
Beatrice! No!

83
00:06:58,236 --> 00:07:01,155
- Martyr.
- You lost her.

84
00:07:01,276 --> 00:07:03,955
- Martyr.
- You lied to her.

85
00:07:04,076 --> 00:07:04,994
You lost her.

86
00:07:05,116 --> 00:07:07,234
Never will you know her flesh again.

87
00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:12,034
Never will you know her love.

88
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:13,074
Her sin.

89
00:07:13,195 --> 00:07:15,433
- Martyr. Martyr.
- You lost her!

90
00:07:15,554 --> 00:07:17,873
- Her desire.
- You lied to her.

91
00:07:17,994 --> 00:07:20,233
- Your sins.
- Never will you know her flesh again.

92
00:07:22,314 --> 00:07:23,793
Your sins.

93
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:26,152
Never will you know her flesh.

94
00:07:26,273 --> 00:07:28,192
You are bound.

95
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:31,712
- Martyr.
- You lied to her.

96
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,152
- Martyr.
- Martyr.

97
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:39,111
Why, God?
Why are you doing this?

98
00:07:40,392 --> 00:07:43,629
It is not the Lord that brought you
to this fate, Dante.

99
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:48,470
What are you? Shade or living man?

100
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,510
Not man, though once I was.

101
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,350
I lived under Augustus in the time
of the false and lying gods.

102
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,390
Are you not Virgil, glory of the poets?

103
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,149
He who wrote the Aeneid,
the treasure of Rome?

104
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:03,588
Why do you seek such woe, Dante?

105
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:06,347
I seek only my beloved Beatrice
and nothing more.

106
00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:09,787
But I cannot open these accursed gates!

107
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:14,067
Have you lost all faith in God, O man?

108
00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:16,386
Has the way been so obscured?

109
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:21,587
Heavenly Father,
if only one soul should be saved,

110
00:08:21,707 --> 00:08:24,145
please let it be Beatrice.

111
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:29,504
Help! Help!

112
00:08:35,745 --> 00:08:40,545
Dante, if you broke your promise to me,
I'll be forever damned.

113
00:08:40,665 --> 00:08:44,824
Are you prepared to be judged in this place?

114
00:08:44,945 --> 00:08:48,023
Do you think you are without sin?

115
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:50,583
Please, don't let him take me!

116
00:08:50,703 --> 00:08:54,463
Beatrice. Beatrice!

117
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:30,699
What did Beatrice do
to deserve such a monstrous fate?

118
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:34,458
She made a wager with Lucifer
to see your safe return.

119
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,698
She lost.

120
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:37,458
Wager. What wager?

121
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:40,298
Lucifer bet that you would betray her love.

122
00:09:40,418 --> 00:09:42,136
I never betrayed her.

123
00:09:42,258 --> 00:09:44,938
You only deceive yourself, mortal.

124
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:49,256
By all that is holy, I vow to forsake
all pleasures of the flesh

125
00:09:49,377 --> 00:09:51,655
until I return from this noble crusade.

126
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:56,095
I gave myself to you because I know
you will be faithful to our love.

127
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,456
And when I return, we shall be married.

128
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:03,775
And live to grow old and see
our grandchildren have children.

129
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:10,454
I love you more than Heaven itself.

130
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,453
- Take this.
- But, Beatrice,

131
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:18,293
this has been in your family
for generations.

132
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:20,252
It is a true relic

133
00:10:20,374 --> 00:10:23,332
said to contain a thorn
from the crown of Christ.

134
00:10:23,453 --> 00:10:25,133
Bring it back to me.

135
00:10:29,532 --> 00:10:31,971
Great Virgil, lead me into the Inferno.

136
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:33,971
I beg of you, please!

137
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:37,491
I must save Beatrice
even if it means my death.

138
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:42,370
I will guide you, but you must put aside
all division of spirit

139
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:45,171
and gather your soul against all fear.

140
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:48,210
I fear nothing.

141
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,850
Then proceed.

142
00:10:55,211 --> 00:10:59,408
Charon will carry us
to the first circle of Hell, Limbo.

143
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:01,888
Nine circles comprise the Inferno,

144
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,248
with Lucifer residing in the lowest.

145
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:06,408
Horrifying, yes.

146
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:08,127
There are more damned in Hell...

147
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:10,366
than liberated in Paradise.

148
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:13,846
I can see their sins in life.

149
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:20,086
Charon's boat has grown wide
and mighty over the millennia.

150
00:11:20,207 --> 00:11:23,565
He has had to compensate
for the ever-increasing damned.

151
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:27,085
Through me the way to the city of woe.

152
00:11:27,206 --> 00:11:31,125
Through me the way to everlasting pain.

153
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:32,564
I don't like the look of this.

154
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:35,604
Now shall I ferry you into the fire,

155
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:39,124
the cold and the everlasting darkness.

156
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:43,004
Abandon hope,
all ye who enter here.

157
00:11:43,124 --> 00:11:44,923
How could God allow this?

158
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:48,403
God allowed free will, even for his angels.

159
00:11:48,523 --> 00:11:51,723
It was Lucifer that devised such torment.

160
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,843
Mercenaries of Florentina,

161
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,402
in payment for reclaiming
the Holy Land,

162
00:11:56,524 --> 00:12:01,761
your Immaculate Father hereby
absolves you of all your sins.

163
00:12:01,882 --> 00:12:03,840
Go with grace.

164
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:08,161
Praise God.

165
00:12:09,402 --> 00:12:12,120
Do you think a priest
has such divine power?

166
00:12:12,241 --> 00:12:14,640
Can he truly absolve us of sins so easily?

167
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:16,079
Of course, Francesco.

168
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:20,119
Why would you doubt the Church?
That is the path to Hell, my friend.

169
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,838
How soon until you leave?

170
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,398
Tomorrow, before dawn.

171
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:27,478
Dante, promise to watch over my brother.

172
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:29,918
Beatrice, I'm no child.

173
00:12:30,638 --> 00:12:32,758
No harm will come to him, my love.

174
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,918
I'll protect him as if he were my own.

175
00:12:36,718 --> 00:12:38,997
You who are living,

176
00:12:39,117 --> 00:12:42,316
be gone from those who are dead.

177
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:44,236
I will not part, Charon!

178
00:12:44,357 --> 00:12:46,717
I must cross!

179
00:12:46,837 --> 00:12:49,316
I give you my soul to find Beatrice!

180
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:53,355
It belongs to us already, mortal.

181
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,909
Your will is nothing, mortal.

182
00:13:41,031 --> 00:13:44,509
You will never traverse the circles of Hell.

183
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,909
Take me to Beatrice, demon!

184
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:23,024
Virgil, where did you disappear to?

185
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:25,304
I am pure spirit, Dante.

186
00:14:25,425 --> 00:14:29,025
I cannot help you fight your enemies.
I am naught but a guide.

187
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:56,741
Dante! Can you hear me?

188
00:14:57,621 --> 00:15:00,302
Can anyone hear me?

189
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:07,220
Dante?

190
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:10,259
Thank God.
I knew you would find me.

191
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:11,780
Dante?

192
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:14,859
Beatrice, my love.

193
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,979
Is... Is that you?

194
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:24,337
No! Dante!

195
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:26,777
No, stop! Stop, Dante!

196
00:15:38,176 --> 00:15:40,376
What's happening?

197
00:15:40,496 --> 00:15:43,496
How many ways can a man die?

198
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:44,616
No!

199
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:47,016
Come to me, Beatrice.

200
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:51,175
- I want to admire you.
- No. Let me go.

201
00:15:51,296 --> 00:15:54,974
There is not only suffering in Hell, my love.

202
00:15:55,894 --> 00:15:58,894
There are untold pleasures here,

203
00:15:59,015 --> 00:16:04,294
pleasures your human senses
could not fathom.

204
00:16:04,414 --> 00:16:05,773
Never!

205
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:24,611
There is nothing you can do
to hurt me, child.

206
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:30,330
What you perceive of me is a literal shadow
of my former self,

207
00:16:30,451 --> 00:16:32,850
but you...

208
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:39,569
you can die a thousand deaths by my will.

209
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:48,488
What?

210
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:54,129
Think of the tortures I can create

211
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:59,247
for such a pure, delicate, angelic soul.

212
00:17:05,928 --> 00:17:08,526
Tell me more about your life on Earth,
great poet.

213
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:11,206
I know your deeds,
but not the man you were.

214
00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:13,884
Publius Vergilius Maro was my name.

215
00:17:14,006 --> 00:17:15,926
I was the son of a commoner,

216
00:17:16,047 --> 00:17:19,283
and though I died a dozen years
before the birth of Christ,

217
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,565
I foretold his coming in my works.

218
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:23,804
What is this place, Virgil?

219
00:17:23,924 --> 00:17:27,084
The first circle of the Inferno, Limbo.

220
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:29,724
Here suffer those that did not sin,

221
00:17:29,845 --> 00:17:32,523
yet did not have the required faith.

222
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:37,081
This is the realm where virtuous pagans
and unbaptized babies reside.

223
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:46,962
A child? Here?

224
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:49,001
How can this be?

225
00:17:50,363 --> 00:17:52,121
Dearest Dante.

226
00:17:52,242 --> 00:17:56,921
This is the fourth letter I have written
and the fourth I have destroyed.

227
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,879
I am five months with child.

228
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:03,679
I fear telling your father
as we have yet to be married.

229
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,160
I do not know how much longer
I can conceal my state.

230
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,479
All I ask is that you return to me soon.

231
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,799
Leave this terrible crusade,

232
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:18,318
and we... we can be married.

233
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:28,517
My lady, what is it?

234
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:30,797
The baby.

235
00:18:44,236 --> 00:18:47,075
This is my son.

236
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:55,235
Oh, Beatrice, I didn't know.

237
00:18:56,355 --> 00:18:59,753
Come. Quickly, Dante.
This is not a place to contemplate.

238
00:19:03,354 --> 00:19:05,593
What madness is this?

239
00:19:22,312 --> 00:19:24,831
Lord, too many.

240
00:19:32,312 --> 00:19:33,830
Virgil. Virgil!

241
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,789
In here, Dante. Hurry.

242
00:19:54,108 --> 00:19:56,787
What is that sound?
More demons?

243
00:19:56,908 --> 00:19:58,626
No.

244
00:20:06,307 --> 00:20:08,506
They are familiar to me.

245
00:20:08,627 --> 00:20:11,825
The great rulers and philosophers
of the golden age.

246
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:14,385
Is that not Hector and Electra?

247
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,265
Caesar and King Latinus?

248
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:18,745
And do not forget Plato,
Socrates and Aristotle.

249
00:20:18,866 --> 00:20:20,464
I have never agreed to such terms.

250
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:25,103
I say that God exists in the realm of ideas,
accessible to human thought.

251
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:31,142
Plato, there is only one philosophy
in the Inferno - Lucifer's.

252
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:35,063
Do not look for liberation here, old friend.

253
00:20:36,264 --> 00:20:38,743
- Do you know this shade?
- He was Saladin,

254
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,502
a noble Kurdish sultan.

255
00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:44,700
I fought his forces in the Crusades
under Richard the Lionheart.

256
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:53,340
Filthy heretic, Jerusalem is ours.

257
00:20:55,182 --> 00:20:58,700
We will wash these holy lands
in your heathen blood.

258
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:00,740
Father...

259
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:04,699
Mercy, noble knight. She's only a child.

260
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:08,898
Dante! Dante, the forces
of Saladin arw routed!

261
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,738
Dante?

262
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,175
My God, what is it?

263
00:21:48,295 --> 00:21:50,095
He is King Minos.

264
00:21:50,215 --> 00:21:52,173
Once a king of Crete

265
00:21:52,294 --> 00:21:55,534
before Daedalus
boiled him in his own bath.

266
00:21:55,654 --> 00:21:59,134
Now, Minos foreverjudges the damned,

267
00:21:59,255 --> 00:22:01,932
sending them to their circle below.

268
00:22:02,894 --> 00:22:04,452
- Through him...
- Traitor.

269
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,451
...all must pass.

270
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:08,212
Heretic.

271
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,011
Glutton.

272
00:22:11,773 --> 00:22:13,571
Hoarder.

273
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:15,410
Suicide!

274
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,409
Who comes into my house of pain?

275
00:22:20,532 --> 00:22:24,090
He who seeks Beatrice.
Let me pass, that I may find her.

276
00:22:26,731 --> 00:22:31,569
Turn back.
There is no place for you here.

277
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,650
Not yet, O mortal.

278
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:38,369
With your permission or not,
I pass, monster.

279
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,368
You dare so speak
to the judge of the damned?

280
00:22:47,768 --> 00:22:49,287
I dare.

281
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:20,164
I will judge you to the lowest circle of Hell.

282
00:23:21,805 --> 00:23:25,163
Lucifer shall devour you for eternity!

283
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:28,923
Silence, Minos. It is his fate to proceed.

284
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,479
Here you must descend.

285
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:10,198
The damned are trying to flee.

286
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,478
Lucifer will not be pleased.

287
00:24:13,438 --> 00:24:16,677
Let him come.
If these demons can die in the Inferno,

288
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:18,796
then so can he.

289
00:24:39,716 --> 00:24:41,235
What is this place?

290
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:44,633
This is the second circle,
the circle of Lust.

291
00:24:44,754 --> 00:24:47,794
To this torment are condemned
the carnal damned.

292
00:24:47,915 --> 00:24:49,793
They are the great lustful of the world.

293
00:24:49,915 --> 00:24:55,432
See there Semiramis and Ninus,
Anthony and Cleopatra,

294
00:24:55,553 --> 00:24:57,872
Helen of Troy and Paris.

295
00:24:57,994 --> 00:25:00,432
The storms of lust forever rage

296
00:25:00,554 --> 00:25:02,792
while passion inflames the heart.

297
00:25:05,234 --> 00:25:08,631
Listen, on the wind.

298
00:25:08,752 --> 00:25:11,351
- Dante, help me.
- Beatrice!

299
00:25:11,472 --> 00:25:13,230
Please, Dante.

300
00:25:13,351 --> 00:25:14,951
Dante.

301
00:25:15,071 --> 00:25:17,510
- Beatrice!
- Dante, hold.

302
00:25:17,631 --> 00:25:19,430
Beatrice!

303
00:25:20,951 --> 00:25:24,230
A new visitor arrives, sisters.

304
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,428
Come, embrace us, Dante.

305
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:33,668
We know what you want.
We can see it in your eyes.

306
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:36,348
Unbearable lust.

307
00:25:37,351 --> 00:25:40,428
No, let me pass.
Stand aside, harlot.

308
00:25:40,948 --> 00:25:44,788
If you won't have us, we shall have you!

309
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,744
Dante, how could you let this happen?

310
00:26:16,864 --> 00:26:18,424
How could you betray me?

311
00:26:18,545 --> 00:26:20,462
No, Beatrice. I swear.

312
00:26:20,585 --> 00:26:22,864
What do you swear, Dante?

313
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:25,582
Do you want me to show her the truth?

314
00:26:25,703 --> 00:26:29,463
Serpent. It's all lies.
I never betrayed her.

315
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:32,063
I'll kill you!

316
00:26:33,102 --> 00:26:38,541
You can hide from
neither memory nor sin, Dante.

317
00:26:42,422 --> 00:26:46,700
What? King Richard wants us
to stand guard over 3,000 prisoners?

318
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:48,340
That is his command?

319
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:52,339
He will negotiate their exchange
for the rwturn of the true Cross.

320
00:26:52,461 --> 00:26:55,500
Negotiate with heretics?

321
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:59,180
Never! They deserve only damnation.

322
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:04,019
Get your hands off her.

323
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:08,539
Infidel scum. We'll show you not to defy us.

324
00:27:16,697 --> 00:27:20,336
Good and noble knights, have mercy.
I beg you!

325
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:24,376
This prisoner only tried to save me
from the guards.

326
00:27:25,336 --> 00:27:29,215
Please, sir, show compassion.
He is no threat.

327
00:27:29,336 --> 00:27:32,136
He is a heretic.
He gets what he deserves.

328
00:27:35,335 --> 00:27:38,975
Kind lord, if you would show him mercy

329
00:27:39,095 --> 00:27:42,694
perhaps I could give you comfort in return.

330
00:27:42,815 --> 00:27:45,773
What comfort could you give
a soldier of God?

331
00:27:48,894 --> 00:27:52,013
The nights here are lonely and cold,
my lord,

332
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:54,973
even for a soldier of God.

333
00:27:55,094 --> 00:27:56,812
Perhaps I could warm thee.

334
00:27:56,933 --> 00:27:59,452
Dante, do not commit this wicked sin.

335
00:27:59,573 --> 00:28:02,291
How is it a sin if I am already absolved?

336
00:28:02,412 --> 00:28:04,332
Guards, hold.

337
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:13,131
Thank you, Lord. You are kind.

338
00:28:13,252 --> 00:28:15,490
I could see it in your eyes.

339
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:17,931
And your promise of comfort?

340
00:28:26,411 --> 00:28:28,809
How could you do that to me...

341
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:31,009
to us?

342
00:28:31,129 --> 00:28:33,648
I was weak. The war changed me.

343
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:37,168
You know who I am inside.
We've known each other since childhood.

344
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:39,728
Does she know you, Dante,

345
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:43,486
or did the Crusades show her your true self?

346
00:28:44,008 --> 00:28:46,607
Beatrice! Forgive me!

347
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,446
Please forgive me.

348
00:28:52,726 --> 00:28:57,165
No, it's not true.
He wouldn't do this to me.

349
00:28:57,286 --> 00:28:59,245
Dante!

350
00:28:59,366 --> 00:29:01,044
What did I say?

351
00:29:01,165 --> 00:29:04,525
Even the purest of souls
can be corrupted.

352
00:29:04,646 --> 00:29:07,924
Dante is not the man you once knew.

353
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:11,965
You did this to him.
You corrupted his heart.

354
00:29:13,405 --> 00:29:16,204
I've had no need to influence humanity

355
00:29:16,324 --> 00:29:19,002
for many millennia, my dear.

356
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:22,683
I simply introduced sin.

357
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:26,962
Man is the one who has spread it
like a disease,

358
00:29:27,082 --> 00:29:30,802
cultivating it, empowering it.

359
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:45,759
It is not our fault, none of it.

360
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,599
Man is good.

361
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,480
No, you don't understand.

362
00:29:50,601 --> 00:29:53,999
The Earth is another form of Hell,

363
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:57,079
and men are its demons.

364
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:06,037
I failed her, Virgil. I betrayed her.

365
00:30:06,158 --> 00:30:09,517
I could blame the Crusades,
but I know it was my own weakness,

366
00:30:09,637 --> 00:30:11,038
my own sin.

367
00:30:11,158 --> 00:30:14,836
Have you considered she is not
the only soul you are here to save?

368
00:30:16,877 --> 00:30:19,476
I seek only my beloved Beatrice,

369
00:30:19,597 --> 00:30:21,316
and nothing more.

370
00:30:23,677 --> 00:30:25,076
It is Cerberus,

371
00:30:25,197 --> 00:30:29,036
guardian of the third circle, Gluttony.

372
00:30:42,234 --> 00:30:46,073
That is the foulest fate
one could ever imagine.

373
00:30:46,194 --> 00:30:49,913
And it is your fate as well,
for the true circle of Gluttony

374
00:30:50,034 --> 00:30:52,792
lies inside of Cerberus's body.

375
00:30:52,914 --> 00:30:57,472
Inside? Good Lord, isn't there
perhaps a way around it?

376
00:30:57,593 --> 00:31:00,871
No, not if you wish to reach fair Beatrice.

377
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:04,431
So be it! For her I will conquer even this.

378
00:31:04,552 --> 00:31:06,551
Face me, wretched creature!

379
00:31:10,392 --> 00:31:12,391
Release me, demon!

380
00:31:29,949 --> 00:31:33,948
Hell can get no more horrible
than this place.

381
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:36,627
I find this circle most unpleasant.

382
00:31:36,747 --> 00:31:39,107
You're a shade.
You should try wearing skin.

383
00:31:39,228 --> 00:31:41,267
Such a fate. Look at them all.

384
00:31:41,387 --> 00:31:45,027
How could such harmless sin
provoke such everlasting torment?

385
00:31:45,148 --> 00:31:48,667
The gluttons -
what they could not satisfy in life,

386
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:51,666
in death they shall be denied for eternity.

387
00:31:51,787 --> 00:31:54,784
Dante. Do you remember me, Dante?

388
00:31:54,906 --> 00:31:58,585
I too am from Florence.
You were born before I died.

389
00:31:58,706 --> 00:32:00,425
I do not know you, spirit.

390
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:03,583
You know me. I am Ciacco.

391
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:05,465
Gluttony was my offense,

392
00:32:05,586 --> 00:32:08,863
and here I remain
mere skin and bones.

393
00:32:08,985 --> 00:32:12,342
Can you help me,
free me from this agony?

394
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:13,742
Please, please.

395
00:32:13,862 --> 00:32:18,182
Your suffering weighs heavy
on my heart, spirit. Be free.

396
00:32:32,502 --> 00:32:33,501
Virgil, what's happening?

397
00:32:33,622 --> 00:32:36,619
How dare you free the damned?

398
00:32:36,742 --> 00:32:41,460
They deserve torment for wasting
their fleeting precious lives.

399
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,260
And Beatrice? Does she deserve torment?

400
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,379
She is the exception.

401
00:32:46,501 --> 00:32:50,819
A pure soul to remind me
of my place in Heaven,

402
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:54,618
to remind me of the light of my father.

403
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:57,897
But let me ask you, Dante,

404
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:00,897
what of your father?

405
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:04,418
Beatrice, you must eat.

406
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:06,377
I have no appetite.

407
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:08,576
I know you miss my son,

408
00:33:08,698 --> 00:33:11,896
but you must keep up
your constitution, child.

409
00:33:12,017 --> 00:33:14,056
You're nothing but bone.

410
00:33:14,178 --> 00:33:17,175
It's unappealing for a lady.

411
00:33:18,937 --> 00:33:21,815
Beatrice, what have you done to yourself?

412
00:33:26,455 --> 00:33:28,975
It's just another memory, Dante.

413
00:33:30,015 --> 00:33:32,255
Your father's memory.

414
00:33:32,376 --> 00:33:36,255
- My father?
- He is here with us, Dante.

415
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,373
Would you like to visit him?

416
00:33:48,213 --> 00:33:51,052
Do these tortures never end?

417
00:33:53,052 --> 00:33:54,732
Virgil, Beatrice is not here.

418
00:33:54,853 --> 00:33:56,850
We must escape this beast!

419
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,850
What is this?

420
00:34:05,692 --> 00:34:09,410
Cerberus's black heart.
Destroy it, quickly.

421
00:34:37,807 --> 00:34:39,525
Beatrice!

422
00:35:08,804 --> 00:35:11,843
More gold than I've ever laid eyes upon.

423
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:14,762
What could one man do
with so much treasure?

424
00:35:15,763 --> 00:35:19,441
This is the fourth circle - Grwed.

425
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:39,681
All the Earth's treasure
that is beneath the moon or ever was

426
00:35:39,802 --> 00:35:42,479
cannot give relief to these weary souls.

427
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:51,558
What a mockery is made
of the brief battle for possessions

428
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,359
that makes so short a life.

429
00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:56,278
These damned remind me of my father.

430
00:36:03,998 --> 00:36:07,117
48, 49, 50, 51...

431
00:36:08,037 --> 00:36:11,877
What? Where are my last three coins?

432
00:36:11,997 --> 00:36:13,835
Dante?

433
00:36:14,956 --> 00:36:16,436
Dante!

434
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:19,596
Bella!

435
00:36:21,156 --> 00:36:22,754
Yes, husband.

436
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:25,555
I'm short three crowns.

437
00:36:25,676 --> 00:36:28,035
Are you stealing from me, woman?

438
00:36:28,155 --> 00:36:31,354
No, Alighiero,
I would never do such a thing.

439
00:36:33,034 --> 00:36:34,434
Liar!

440
00:36:38,513 --> 00:36:40,473
I knew I'd have to watch you.

441
00:36:40,594 --> 00:36:42,712
Now, tell me where
you've hidden it, woman,

442
00:36:42,832 --> 00:36:45,512
before I throttle you dead.

443
00:36:48,393 --> 00:36:50,671
Don't hit her! Mother!

444
00:37:04,231 --> 00:37:06,750
Can you believe that in my youth
I wanted to be a poet?

445
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:09,149
But all I ever knew was violence.

446
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,989
And what became of your mother?

447
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,149
She died of a fever a year later.

448
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:15,270
It was sudden and terrible.

449
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:20,869
There is no room to pity the dead here, son.

450
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:25,467
Lucifer did not lie, but then again
how could you not be here, Father?

451
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:28,787
You think you're a greater man than me?

452
00:37:28,908 --> 00:37:31,626
That you're above reproach for your sins?

453
00:37:31,748 --> 00:37:35,186
I took up the Crusade.
The priest absolved us.

454
00:37:35,747 --> 00:37:38,308
And you actually believed him?

455
00:37:38,428 --> 00:37:40,946
No man can absolve you of your sins,

456
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:44,746
but some men can be rewarded in Hell.

457
00:37:54,745 --> 00:37:57,625
Lucifer offered me a thousand years
free of torture

458
00:37:57,745 --> 00:38:01,943
and endless gold
if I would slay my own son.

459
00:38:02,424 --> 00:38:04,343
And where will you spend this gold, Father?

460
00:38:04,464 --> 00:38:07,302
Let me pass. I only seek Beatrice.

461
00:38:12,263 --> 00:38:13,702
So be it.

462
00:38:28,742 --> 00:38:30,940
I always despised you.

463
00:38:32,742 --> 00:38:35,099
But you became me, son.

464
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,299
You belong here. You always have.

465
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,817
So I can be damned in Hell with you?
Never!

466
00:38:54,178 --> 00:38:57,937
It's time to claim my prize, boy.

467
00:38:58,058 --> 00:38:59,815
Then claim it.

468
00:39:14,177 --> 00:39:16,575
You want gold, Father?

469
00:39:16,696 --> 00:39:18,135
It's yours.

470
00:39:24,015 --> 00:39:26,734
I cannot go on.

471
00:39:26,854 --> 00:39:28,373
You must, Dante.

472
00:39:28,494 --> 00:39:31,613
Steel yourself.
The journey is not half over.

473
00:39:31,734 --> 00:39:36,212
How do I know you're not
another enemy sent by Lucifer?

474
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,612
You could be luring me
to my doom all along.

475
00:39:38,733 --> 00:39:40,811
Another trick, another deception.

476
00:39:40,934 --> 00:39:42,731
Search inside yourself.

477
00:39:42,853 --> 00:39:45,571
You know I was sent here from on high.

478
00:39:45,692 --> 00:39:47,411
Forgive me, Virgil.

479
00:39:47,532 --> 00:39:50,371
This place has affected my mind.
Let us move on.

480
00:39:57,131 --> 00:40:00,930
Please, Lord.
Forgive me of my transgressions.

481
00:40:01,051 --> 00:40:03,529
Save me from this horrible torment.

482
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,689
Please, I beg of you.

483
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,968
My God.

484
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:16,648
I have heard your prayers,
beloved Beatrice,

485
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:18,768
and I have come for you.

486
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:23,527
There is no escape, little soul.

487
00:40:23,648 --> 00:40:26,486
Your prayers are worthless here.

488
00:40:36,927 --> 00:40:38,725
Rejoice, child,

489
00:40:38,846 --> 00:40:43,325
for you are about to be granted
a rare privilege in the Inferno.

490
00:40:44,365 --> 00:40:47,285
I am making you my bride.

491
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:51,364
You will become the Queen of Hell.

492
00:40:52,485 --> 00:40:54,564
Are you not pleased?

493
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:10,001
I cannot stand this wretched place.

494
00:41:10,123 --> 00:41:13,441
For we are in the fifth circle, Anger.

495
00:41:13,563 --> 00:41:16,201
The very air reeks of fury.

496
00:41:16,322 --> 00:41:18,521
Watch your ankles.

497
00:41:22,402 --> 00:41:25,279
More food! We're starving!

498
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,279
We need more food.

499
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,799
We're doing the best we can.

500
00:41:34,919 --> 00:41:38,320
There isn't enough food to go around.
Quiet! Quiet down!

501
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,519
There is nothing we can do.

502
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,478
The granaries are ablaze.

503
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,639
We barely have enough rations
for our own men.

504
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,357
Then I'm leaving this post.
I will not put up with guard duty any longer.

505
00:41:48,479 --> 00:41:50,557
You can't do that, Dante.

506
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:53,518
We came here to kill these heretics,
not coddle them.

507
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:55,717
We came to reclaim the Holy Land.

508
00:41:55,837 --> 00:41:59,516
Saladin took the city last year
and spared Christian lives.

509
00:41:59,636 --> 00:42:00,516
We should do the same.

510
00:42:00,637 --> 00:42:03,356
Since when arw herwtics
worth a Christian life?

511
00:42:03,476 --> 00:42:05,156
Enough. Enough!

512
00:42:15,675 --> 00:42:19,754
Keep your mind, Dante.
Do not dwell on past deeds here.

513
00:42:21,635 --> 00:42:24,433
See the souls over whom
anger has prevailed.

514
00:42:25,314 --> 00:42:29,593
In the black sludge of the River Styx
do they wish they had never been born.

515
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:33,072
The fools. It is here we must cross.

516
00:42:41,312 --> 00:42:43,151
We travel in that?

517
00:42:43,271 --> 00:42:45,550
Perhaps we would be safer swimming.

518
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,750
I suppose it doesn't get much sturdier.

519
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:57,391
Is this a friend of yours, great poet?

520
00:42:57,511 --> 00:43:00,229
Phlegias is the guardian of the Styx.

521
00:43:00,351 --> 00:43:02,829
He was the son of Ares
and a king in his day.

522
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:06,349
Hold on.
The ride will be somewhat bumpy.

523
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:10,428
The angry souls know no end to their fury.

524
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:14,828
Who are you that comes here
before your time?

525
00:43:14,948 --> 00:43:16,908
If I come, I do not remain.

526
00:43:17,029 --> 00:43:20,228
But I know you, hell dog, filthy as you are.

527
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:21,987
You were Filippo Argenti in life.

528
00:43:22,108 --> 00:43:26,306
Come down, Dante,
and face your old enemy!

529
00:43:26,427 --> 00:43:29,866
Let the damned rip you to shreds, wretch.

530
00:43:47,985 --> 00:43:51,623
Now, my son, the City of Dis draws near,

531
00:43:51,744 --> 00:43:54,223
housing its solemn citizens within.

532
00:43:56,183 --> 00:44:00,782
Damned of Dis rejoice,
for your lord, Lucifer,

533
00:44:00,902 --> 00:44:04,223
is betrothing the pure soul, Beatrice.

534
00:44:04,343 --> 00:44:09,301
Truly this will be a marriage
of Heaven and Hell.

535
00:44:09,422 --> 00:44:12,261
Hurry, Phlegias! Run!

536
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:19,861
Beatrice!

537
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:27,539
Outcasts of Heaven, race despised,

538
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:31,779
why do you rail against a will
that cannot be stopped?

539
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,298
Dante?

540
00:44:54,657 --> 00:44:57,776
He has taken her into the tombs.
Hurry, Dante.

541
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:07,575
Gone. Why does he do this?
Bait us on? Keep us running?

542
00:45:07,696 --> 00:45:11,134
Perhaps Lucifer wants your soul
as well as Beatrice's.

543
00:45:11,255 --> 00:45:13,614
He's luring us to the ninth circle.

544
00:45:14,695 --> 00:45:18,133
- What is this place?
- The tombs of heresy.

545
00:45:18,255 --> 00:45:21,453
Here in the sixth circle
you will find endless heretics

546
00:45:21,575 --> 00:45:23,573
burning in eternal fire.

547
00:45:24,814 --> 00:45:30,052
O Tuscan, who walks through this place
speaking so decorously,

548
00:45:30,173 --> 00:45:33,213
know that I am Farinata.

549
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:38,012
Farinata, another hated man in life.
What do you want, spirit?

550
00:45:38,132 --> 00:45:39,411
Know this.

551
00:45:39,533 --> 00:45:43,771
The damned can foresee the future
but can never know the present.

552
00:45:43,891 --> 00:45:49,050
Your future, Dante,
is filled with death and destruction.

553
00:45:49,172 --> 00:45:52,930
Beatrice will marry Lucifer and reign in Hell,

554
00:45:53,051 --> 00:45:57,530
and you will be damned with us forever.

555
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:08,368
I never liked him.

556
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,568
What's happening?

557
00:46:10,689 --> 00:46:12,167
The harrowing of Hell.

558
00:46:12,288 --> 00:46:14,688
Christ's death forever quakes this circle.

559
00:46:14,808 --> 00:46:16,366
We must hurry.

560
00:46:18,687 --> 00:46:22,125
Let me go. What do you want from me?

561
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:25,406
I have taken countless brides
over the millennia -

562
00:46:25,526 --> 00:46:29,366
Cleopatra, Salome, Helen of Troy.

563
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:34,765
But, unlike them,
your spirit is pure, unspoiled.

564
00:46:34,885 --> 00:46:36,844
I will never succumb to you.

565
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:38,405
Kill me again and again,

566
00:46:38,526 --> 00:46:42,564
slit my throat, tear me to pieces,
but I will never love you.

567
00:46:46,445 --> 00:46:48,923
Yes, such passion.

568
00:46:49,043 --> 00:46:51,244
You have a fire inside you.

569
00:46:51,364 --> 00:46:53,122
After we are properly married,

570
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:57,162
you will give me a brood
to carry on my legacy.

571
00:46:57,284 --> 00:47:02,482
You will be birthing my children for eternity,
sweet soul.

572
00:47:04,044 --> 00:47:06,561
Virgil, do you hear...

573
00:47:13,882 --> 00:47:17,160
Who is this new monster?
What does he want?

574
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,360
The minotaur guards passage
into the seventh circle.

575
00:47:20,481 --> 00:47:21,919
Be cautious, Dante.

576
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,638
How dare you threaten us?

577
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:28,200
Do you think he is the duke of Athens
who served up your death above?

578
00:47:28,321 --> 00:47:31,518
Off with you.
Begone, abomination!

579
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:33,478
Virgil, I think you've made him angry.

580
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,476
Now, while he is blind with rage.

581
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,957
Hold fast. Steady.

582
00:47:38,077 --> 00:47:39,677
Now move!

583
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,236
You have many surprises, poet.

584
00:47:49,357 --> 00:47:52,436
Perhaps you would have made
a great warrior in life.

585
00:47:52,557 --> 00:47:56,276
It was nothing. He was all horn, no brains.

586
00:48:04,276 --> 00:48:06,875
This circle is reserved for the violent.

587
00:48:06,995 --> 00:48:09,195
Those who have done violence
against others

588
00:48:09,315 --> 00:48:11,914
forever boil in the blood they have shed.

589
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:15,314
How shall we cross?

590
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:17,394
It's impossible.

591
00:48:20,953 --> 00:48:22,753
You summoned me, great Virgil.

592
00:48:22,874 --> 00:48:24,632
Greetings, Nessus.

593
00:48:24,752 --> 00:48:28,592
We need passage across the bloody
Phlegethon. Can you help us?

594
00:48:28,712 --> 00:48:31,632
Of course. Climb and hold on tightly.

595
00:48:33,312 --> 00:48:35,152
The river is treacherous.

596
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:40,350
Here is Alexander, Dionysius, Attila,

597
00:48:40,472 --> 00:48:42,510
and countless others.

598
00:48:43,271 --> 00:48:46,389
The damned here
are worse off than the Styx.

599
00:48:46,511 --> 00:48:50,550
These were the kings of bloodshed
and despoilment.

600
00:49:06,948 --> 00:49:09,827
Be wary of the next passage, friends.

601
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:11,907
My thanks, Nessus.

602
00:49:12,028 --> 00:49:14,546
Good luck to you, mortal soul.

603
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:20,506
We must hurry. Beatrice can wait no longer.

604
00:49:24,506 --> 00:49:27,186
This is no forest.

605
00:49:27,306 --> 00:49:30,626
Yes, they are those who did violence
to themselves.

606
00:49:30,746 --> 00:49:33,385
- This is the wood of suicide.
- Dante...

607
00:49:33,505 --> 00:49:35,865
- No, my friend! Turn back!
- Come to me, Dante.

608
00:49:35,986 --> 00:49:38,584
Come to me, Dante.

609
00:49:38,705 --> 00:49:40,984
Come to me.

610
00:49:41,105 --> 00:49:45,304
Why do you break me?
Have you no pity?

611
00:49:45,424 --> 00:49:46,703
Mother?

612
00:49:46,824 --> 00:49:48,344
Yes, son.

613
00:49:48,465 --> 00:49:50,982
I too am among the damned.

614
00:49:51,104 --> 00:49:53,342
But how can this be?

615
00:49:53,984 --> 00:49:55,901
When a soul takes its own life,

616
00:49:56,024 --> 00:49:58,222
Minos judges it to this circle.

617
00:49:58,343 --> 00:50:01,260
Here it sprouts, shoots up like a sapling.

618
00:50:01,382 --> 00:50:03,581
No body, only pain.

619
00:50:03,703 --> 00:50:06,781
No, Mother, you don't belong here.

620
00:50:06,902 --> 00:50:08,461
You died of fever.

621
00:50:09,302 --> 00:50:11,581
Her heart gave out from the fever.

622
00:50:11,701 --> 00:50:14,100
She was just too fragile.

623
00:50:14,221 --> 00:50:16,020
Where is she now, Father?

624
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:21,260
In Paradise, son,
with all the souls of pure light.

625
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,058
I despised your father's cruelty,

626
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:26,818
but I was too weak to defy him.

627
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,259
And so, I...

628
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,819
I took my...

629
00:50:32,299 --> 00:50:36,817
You learned your father's ways,
but you are not lost.

630
00:50:36,938 --> 00:50:39,379
You can redeem yourself.

631
00:50:39,499 --> 00:50:43,696
Beatrice was all I had.
How could I have betrayed her?

632
00:50:43,817 --> 00:50:47,616
The pain you endure purifies you, son.

633
00:50:47,738 --> 00:50:53,616
Heed my words. You must look
into your deepest sin to save her.

634
00:50:54,535 --> 00:50:56,415
And what of you?

635
00:50:56,536 --> 00:51:01,255
Only the living can redeem themselves.
I cannot.

636
00:51:01,376 --> 00:51:04,494
This is too cruel a punishment
for you, Mother.

637
00:51:04,615 --> 00:51:08,773
God must know this is not your fault.
I'm going to free you.

638
00:51:16,734 --> 00:51:20,214
My soul belongs to God now, son.

639
00:51:35,451 --> 00:51:37,810
We are still in the seventh circle?

640
00:51:37,932 --> 00:51:40,530
Yes, the Abominable Sands.

641
00:51:40,652 --> 00:51:44,369
It is here the damned
did violence against God.

642
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:50,888
We came here to kill these heretics.

643
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:53,167
We came to reclaim the Holy Land.

644
00:51:53,289 --> 00:51:57,568
Saladin took the city last year and spared
Christian lives. We should do the same.

645
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:01,007
Since when arw herwtics
worth a Christian life?

646
00:52:01,129 --> 00:52:02,847
Enough. Enough!

647
00:52:04,007 --> 00:52:05,448
Dante, no!

648
00:52:19,047 --> 00:52:20,605
Fight with me, Crusaders.

649
00:52:20,727 --> 00:52:22,725
Spill the blood of these heathens.

650
00:52:22,846 --> 00:52:25,526
Their souls are already lost.

651
00:52:26,206 --> 00:52:28,764
Dante, what have you done?

652
00:52:52,883 --> 00:52:55,082
Crusaders? Herw?

653
00:52:55,203 --> 00:52:56,802
Why are you being punished?

654
00:52:56,922 --> 00:52:59,882
Our cause was holy.
We are absolved of sin.

655
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:07,760
The bishop lied, did he not, brother?

656
00:53:07,881 --> 00:53:10,641
Francesco, not you too.

657
00:53:10,761 --> 00:53:13,199
God never condones violence of any kind.

658
00:53:13,321 --> 00:53:16,318
There was no holy war.
Don't you understand?

659
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,320
The priests lied.

660
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,278
Of all people, how could you be here?

661
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,119
It was you! You did this to me!

662
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:25,998
No, no, no, listen.

663
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:29,637
You don't deserve the life given to you,

664
00:53:29,758 --> 00:53:31,957
you don't deserve Beatrice,

665
00:53:32,078 --> 00:53:35,717
and now you will join us here forever
where you belong.

666
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:42,597
Brother.

667
00:53:48,596 --> 00:53:50,676
I am not your brother.

668
00:53:50,797 --> 00:53:54,074
You're an animal, Dante.
A monster!

669
00:53:56,635 --> 00:53:58,795
I will not let you have her.

670
00:54:12,674 --> 00:54:15,712
You know I'm the better swordsman, Dante.

671
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:39,750
It's over. Justice is inevitable.

672
00:54:40,072 --> 00:54:41,950
Not yet.

673
00:55:17,907 --> 00:55:19,945
He can rest for a while,

674
00:55:20,065 --> 00:55:25,024
but he is forever bound here
like a shadow of time unforgotten.

675
00:55:25,145 --> 00:55:27,704
He was a good man.

676
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,063
He doesn't deserve such suffering.

677
00:55:30,184 --> 00:55:34,183
Heavenly Father,
let the soul of Francesco rise

678
00:55:34,304 --> 00:55:36,703
into your divine Paradise.

679
00:55:38,704 --> 00:55:40,143
What?

680
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:44,822
Pray for your own soul, Dante,

681
00:55:44,944 --> 00:55:48,982
for it will freeze with me forever
in Cocytus below.

682
00:55:49,103 --> 00:55:51,581
I'll kill you in your own circle, Devil.

683
00:55:51,701 --> 00:55:54,141
Yes, a contest.

684
00:55:54,263 --> 00:55:59,181
Hurry, Dante. Your beloved Beatrice
is soon my queen.

685
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:13,378
This is the union
of the three great rivers of Hell.

686
00:56:24,979 --> 00:56:27,018
Another beast I must slay?

687
00:56:28,378 --> 00:56:31,937
No, Dante. Geryon is our passage
to the eighth circle.

688
00:56:32,378 --> 00:56:35,777
Climb inside. And be wary - it bites.

689
00:56:46,296 --> 00:56:47,856
My thanks, Geryon.

690
00:56:47,976 --> 00:56:49,896
This way, Dante.

691
00:56:51,655 --> 00:56:53,814
We are in the circle of Fraud

692
00:56:53,935 --> 00:56:57,175
which one commits
upon those who trust in him.

693
00:57:00,894 --> 00:57:03,293
You must travel these ten malebolge alone.

694
00:57:03,413 --> 00:57:05,973
And quickly - Beatrice is soon to wed.

695
00:57:06,094 --> 00:57:09,372
Alone? What of you, great poet?

696
00:57:09,493 --> 00:57:11,373
I will not be far, believe me.

697
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,292
You have proven yourself worthy.

698
00:57:13,413 --> 00:57:17,772
Now hurry, Dante,
lest you lose your love forever.

699
00:57:19,933 --> 00:57:23,211
I traveled on alone,
over the flatterers and simonists,

700
00:57:23,332 --> 00:57:26,171
and as I ran I was overwhelmed
with my sins

701
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:29,330
as if every malebolge
was a chasm of memory.

702
00:57:29,452 --> 00:57:31,891
I felt my mind weakening with every step,

703
00:57:32,011 --> 00:57:34,370
and yet I would not cease.

704
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:42,769
Release that one.
His ransom has been paid.

705
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:45,168
My ransom?

706
00:57:45,289 --> 00:57:48,808
No. No, you didn't...

707
00:57:48,929 --> 00:57:51,728
You defiled yourself with him, didn't you?

708
00:57:51,849 --> 00:57:54,688
Didn't you? You whore.

709
00:57:54,809 --> 00:57:56,528
You have shamed me.

710
00:57:56,649 --> 00:57:58,207
You are not my wife, do you hear?

711
00:57:58,327 --> 00:58:00,686
Filthy whore. Whore!

712
00:58:03,168 --> 00:58:06,366
I'll kill you. You bastard dog, I'll kill you.

713
00:58:06,487 --> 00:58:08,365
I swear I'll kill you.

714
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:15,246
You bastard. You'll see everyone
you ever loved dead by my hand.

715
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:17,364
Dead, dead!

716
00:58:18,565 --> 00:58:21,204
No, it can't be.

717
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:33,883
I have come for the woman.

718
00:58:34,004 --> 00:58:35,322
No!

719
00:58:38,363 --> 00:58:41,362
Leave her alone. She's innocent.

720
00:58:41,482 --> 00:58:43,402
Run, Beatrice, run!

721
00:58:44,403 --> 00:58:46,522
Get out of my house, filthy dog.

722
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:57,081
- Get away from me!
- There is no escape for you.

723
00:58:57,203 --> 00:58:59,199
Stay back.

724
00:59:00,961 --> 00:59:02,520
No!

725
00:59:15,799 --> 00:59:18,598
Vengeance is finally mine.

726
00:59:22,718 --> 00:59:26,157
It was me. Beatrice's death.

727
00:59:26,277 --> 00:59:28,437
They were all murdered because of me.

728
00:59:28,557 --> 00:59:32,436
At last, Dante, now you both see the truth.

729
00:59:32,558 --> 00:59:35,955
You are the true cause of
Beatrice's suffering,

730
00:59:36,076 --> 00:59:39,195
and the damnation of so many others.

731
00:59:39,317 --> 00:59:41,876
How could you have done such evil to me?

732
00:59:41,997 --> 00:59:45,955
Tear the heart from my chest,
rip the very soul from my body?

733
00:59:46,076 --> 00:59:49,114
These sins are my own.

734
00:59:49,235 --> 00:59:51,314
You have no right to Beatrice.

735
00:59:51,435 --> 00:59:53,233
Relinquish her.

736
00:59:58,434 --> 01:00:01,513
Never! Dwellers, night fiends,

737
01:00:01,634 --> 01:00:03,594
and torturers of the pit,

738
01:00:03,714 --> 01:00:07,111
strip the flesh from the mortal's bones.

739
01:00:07,232 --> 01:00:08,793
Lucifer!

740
01:00:22,512 --> 01:00:25,670
Beatrice, stop!
You don't know what you're doing!

741
01:00:26,551 --> 01:00:28,310
I thought I knew many things.

742
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:33,109
I thought love was real,
but it was only an illusion, a fraud.

743
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:36,791
There is nothing left for me
in all of God's crwation.

744
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:43,229
Yes, my love.

745
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:46,788
In union, all of Hell's power will be yours.

746
01:00:46,908 --> 01:00:49,227
Beatrice, don't do it!

747
01:00:52,429 --> 01:00:56,586
When you had your way with that girl,
you gave me to Lucifer.

748
01:00:56,707 --> 01:00:58,947
It was all because of you.

749
01:01:00,547 --> 01:01:01,945
Beatrice!

750
01:01:06,146 --> 01:01:07,545
No!

751
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:09,546
No, no.

752
01:01:12,146 --> 01:01:15,104
The faithful has lost her faith.

753
01:01:15,226 --> 01:01:18,664
The incorruptible
has become corrupted.

754
01:01:18,785 --> 01:01:23,344
The true innocent has given way
to the sins of man,

755
01:01:23,465 --> 01:01:26,223
like all the rest before her.

756
01:01:26,344 --> 01:01:29,983
Who can now deny me my rights?

757
01:01:39,102 --> 01:01:42,182
I will leave you with my consort.

758
01:01:43,502 --> 01:01:46,581
She has so much to show you.

759
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,579
This is where you belong, Dante.

760
01:01:59,701 --> 01:02:02,259
You are the greatest fraud of all.

761
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:04,859
You've lied to me, deceived me,

762
01:02:04,981 --> 01:02:08,338
and for that you shall suffer.

763
01:02:10,339 --> 01:02:12,218
Beatrice, don't do this.

764
01:02:19,537 --> 01:02:21,137
You never loved me.

765
01:02:21,258 --> 01:02:23,177
It was all a lie, all of it...

766
01:02:23,298 --> 01:02:25,256
our whole life!

767
01:02:31,217 --> 01:02:35,456
Beatrice, listen to me.
I braved the circles of Hell for you.

768
01:02:35,577 --> 01:02:37,976
You mean nothing to me.

769
01:02:38,096 --> 01:02:42,294
But I have faced my sins.
I am ready to take you home.

770
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:45,774
Faced your sins? Look down, Dante.

771
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:48,455
Look deep into the ninth circle...

772
01:02:51,814 --> 01:02:54,014
the circle of traitors.

773
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:02,853
God in Heaven, what happened?

774
01:03:02,974 --> 01:03:06,933
Who is responsible
for this massacre?

775
01:03:08,773 --> 01:03:12,331
Take care of my sister.
I am responsible.

776
01:03:14,411 --> 01:03:18,649
Hang him, and prepare to march tonight.

777
01:03:18,771 --> 01:03:23,609
When the noble Saladin
learns of this atrocity

778
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:26,531
he will bring forth the very forces of Hell.

779
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:29,330
Take care of Beatrice.

780
01:03:29,451 --> 01:03:31,930
Dante, protect her with your life.

781
01:03:38,609 --> 01:03:41,088
Beatrice, I'm coming home.

782
01:03:46,328 --> 01:03:49,847
I wanted nothing more
than to see you and beg for forgiveness.

783
01:03:49,968 --> 01:03:53,487
I will never forgive what you've done, never.

784
01:03:54,047 --> 01:03:56,846
But while I live, I can absolve you.

785
01:03:56,967 --> 01:04:00,126
Forgive me, and free yourself.

786
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:03,166
My cross.

787
01:04:03,286 --> 01:04:05,565
I brought it back to you.

788
01:04:05,685 --> 01:04:08,805
Accept again the love of God.

789
01:04:21,645 --> 01:04:23,283
Dante.

790
01:04:28,684 --> 01:04:30,443
I forgive you.

791
01:04:30,564 --> 01:04:34,323
I never wanted any harm to come to you.

792
01:04:43,002 --> 01:04:45,560
You have done well, my friend.

793
01:04:45,682 --> 01:04:48,640
And though you may not
understand it now, Dante,

794
01:04:48,761 --> 01:04:53,840
you have perhaps saved far more
than just one innocent soul.

795
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:01,160
Wait. I can't be separated from her now.
I've come this far.

796
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,238
You cannot claim
a place with her yet, Dante.

797
01:05:04,839 --> 01:05:09,077
You have to face the true enemy,
in the lowest part of the ninth circle...

798
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:11,117
the circle of traitors.

799
01:05:11,238 --> 01:05:15,916
There, you must face the king of traitors,
Lucifer himself.

800
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:19,197
He guards your only escape
from the Inferno.

801
01:05:19,918 --> 01:05:23,876
We shall be reunited one day. I promise.

802
01:05:25,116 --> 01:05:26,557
Goodbye, my love.

803
01:05:29,317 --> 01:05:32,915
This last trial is for you to face alone.

804
01:05:33,995 --> 01:05:35,875
Godspeed, my friend.

805
01:05:36,635 --> 01:05:40,193
Very well. I am coming for you, Lucifer.

806
01:05:40,314 --> 01:05:42,913
I will make you pay for her suffering.

807
01:05:43,675 --> 01:05:45,754
I am coming for you.

808
01:05:57,154 --> 01:05:59,511
I fell, not into fire,

809
01:06:02,273 --> 01:06:05,232
but into a vast, frozen wasteland.

810
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:08,751
The very center of Hell,

811
01:06:11,111 --> 01:06:13,230
furthest place in all of creation

812
01:06:13,351 --> 01:06:15,591
from the divine light of God.

813
01:06:17,591 --> 01:06:21,949
Treachery, the ninth circle
of the Inferno.

814
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:33,668
I walked through the darkness,
numb with bitter cold.

815
01:06:36,429 --> 01:06:39,428
All about me were forsaken,

816
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:44,266
frozen souls of deceivers and traitors.

817
01:06:49,867 --> 01:06:55,226
Who are you to walk the paths of Hell
so warmly, O living man?

818
01:06:55,347 --> 01:06:57,865
Damned soul, where is Lucifer?

819
01:06:57,986 --> 01:07:01,146
Tell me, before I too freeze
in this miserable hell.

820
01:07:01,266 --> 01:07:07,424
Wipe the icy tears from my eyes,
and I shall tell you.

821
01:07:16,144 --> 01:07:19,663
The Lord of Hell dwells
at the center of this frozen lake.

822
01:07:19,783 --> 01:07:21,623
Past the storms of Ptolomea,

823
01:07:21,743 --> 01:07:24,342
deep in the center pit of Judecca,

824
01:07:24,463 --> 01:07:26,903
there his icy halls are well protected,

825
01:07:27,024 --> 01:07:30,822
and none but the mightiest
may cleave a path.

826
01:07:30,942 --> 01:07:33,422
But can you believe me?

827
01:07:33,543 --> 01:07:35,540
Can you believe a traitor?

828
01:07:39,901 --> 01:07:43,900
Long did I wander
the dim and icy paths of Hell.

829
01:07:47,341 --> 01:07:49,820
Past the frozen giants of legend...

830
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:54,179
Nimrod, Ephialtes and Antaeus.

831
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:58,017
I was battered by a frigid wind

832
01:07:58,139 --> 01:08:01,658
that was like the beating
of Lucifer's black wings.

833
01:08:06,019 --> 01:08:09,458
Finally, after a seeming eternity,

834
01:08:09,578 --> 01:08:15,097
I came to a passage blocked
by the frozen links of a mighty chain.

835
01:08:17,297 --> 01:08:20,177
Lucifer thinks he can block my way
with this?

836
01:08:20,297 --> 01:08:22,937
He thinks he can stay my vengeance?

837
01:08:56,533 --> 01:08:59,612
Welcome, great Dante.

838
01:08:59,732 --> 01:09:03,532
Welcome to your final resting place,

839
01:09:03,653 --> 01:09:05,530
the circle of traitors.

840
01:09:05,651 --> 01:09:08,571
Lucifer, I have come to escape this hell

841
01:09:08,692 --> 01:09:10,969
so that I may be reunited with my beloved,

842
01:09:11,092 --> 01:09:13,931
but not before I rid the world
of your corruption.

843
01:09:14,051 --> 01:09:16,729
You will never see Beatrice again.

844
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:19,888
The path to Purgatory lies through me.

845
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:23,809
You are the warrior
of a weak and dying God,

846
01:09:23,931 --> 01:09:26,129
a God who is the true evil.

847
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:28,969
His power wanes over the world.

848
01:09:29,089 --> 01:09:32,808
Silence. Your lies
have no power over me, Devil.

849
01:09:32,928 --> 01:09:36,807
I will rend the very soul
from your frozen body.

850
01:09:36,929 --> 01:09:39,047
Indignant fool.

851
01:09:39,169 --> 01:09:41,967
Come, let me devour your soul

852
01:09:42,088 --> 01:09:44,566
as I devoured Judas Iscariot.

853
01:09:44,689 --> 01:09:49,925
You will remain in this pit
until creation's last breath, do you hear?

854
01:09:50,047 --> 01:09:52,006
Never!

855
01:09:52,926 --> 01:09:55,445
You are not invincible here.

856
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:57,885
You are just another demon

857
01:09:58,005 --> 01:10:01,965
and, like any fallen, you can be destroyed.

858
01:10:03,446 --> 01:10:08,004
You cannot destroy me!

859
01:10:21,804 --> 01:10:24,402
What have you done to me?

860
01:10:34,042 --> 01:10:37,040
I have slain you, great beast.

861
01:10:37,162 --> 01:10:40,361
Victory is mine.

862
01:10:40,482 --> 01:10:42,200
What's this?

863
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:54,118
New life writhes inside him.

864
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:55,958
No!

865
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:07,477
Thank you, Dante. I am very impressed.

866
01:11:07,598 --> 01:11:10,717
Many have tried, but all have failed me.

867
01:11:10,838 --> 01:11:14,196
Ulysses, Alexander, Attila, Lancelot...

868
01:11:14,317 --> 01:11:17,756
Truly, you are the greatest of all my minions.

869
01:11:18,636 --> 01:11:20,715
Minion? I do not serve you.

870
01:11:20,837 --> 01:11:23,634
Speak without your forked tongue, serpent!

871
01:11:24,517 --> 01:11:26,556
Do you not?

872
01:11:26,676 --> 01:11:30,436
You freed me
from my eternal torment.

873
01:11:30,556 --> 01:11:32,835
I came only for Beatrice.

874
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:35,915
Beatrice? She was only bait.

875
01:11:36,035 --> 01:11:38,673
It was you I wanted all along.

876
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:43,073
Don't you see?
I was bound by God in this frozen pit,

877
01:11:43,194 --> 01:11:46,432
only my shadow self allowed to roam free.

878
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:50,592
It took a mortal to release me -
you, Dante.

879
01:11:51,274 --> 01:11:52,913
No, it isn't true!

880
01:11:53,033 --> 01:11:54,632
I defeated you before.

881
01:11:54,753 --> 01:11:58,672
Show me the path from Hell,
or I will end your miserable existence.

882
01:11:58,792 --> 01:12:01,191
Destroy an angel of God?

883
01:12:01,312 --> 01:12:03,389
You arrogant gnat.

884
01:12:03,511 --> 01:12:06,071
Such vanity, such pride.

885
01:12:06,192 --> 01:12:09,230
I could have slain you
the moment you fell into Hell.

886
01:12:19,391 --> 01:12:21,187
You worship God,

887
01:12:21,311 --> 01:12:23,989
but it was He who created evil.

888
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:26,828
It was He who created me.

889
01:12:26,948 --> 01:12:31,226
If you knew the true nature of God, Dante,

890
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:33,946
you too would rebel.

891
01:12:34,069 --> 01:12:35,186
No!

892
01:12:35,308 --> 01:12:39,267
You are nothing to me. A talking animal.

893
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:42,027
He made you in His image...

894
01:12:44,267 --> 01:12:47,106
and I was to bow down to you?

895
01:13:01,664 --> 01:13:04,744
I grow weary of this game.

896
01:13:33,381 --> 01:13:38,140
Finally, I will reclaim
my proper place in Heaven.

897
01:13:38,501 --> 01:13:43,539
Behold, Dante.
Beyond the Inferno lies Purgatory,

898
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:46,498
where awaits your precious Beatrice.

899
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:50,338
But instead of you,
I shall escape from this pit.

900
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:54,539
All the souls in Purgatory
shall suffer and burn.

901
01:13:54,660 --> 01:14:00,377
And beyond Purgatory, Paradise itself.

902
01:14:00,498 --> 01:14:04,018
I will plunge the cosmos into chaos,

903
01:14:04,138 --> 01:14:07,057
and it is all your doing, Dante.

904
01:14:07,178 --> 01:14:13,256
Because of you, God will finally
see me rule His creation.

905
01:14:13,377 --> 01:14:17,055
No, I cannot be the cause of this.

906
01:14:17,176 --> 01:14:20,734
There is nothing you can do
to stop me, mortal.

907
01:14:20,855 --> 01:14:23,775
No one can stop me.

908
01:14:23,896 --> 01:14:25,814
One can.

909
01:14:29,854 --> 01:14:34,454
Almighty God, forgive me
for all of my wicked sins.

910
01:14:34,575 --> 01:14:38,652
I forsake my escape.
I give up even Beatrice.

911
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:40,573
I belong here, in Hell,

912
01:14:40,694 --> 01:14:43,013
and accept my just damnation.

913
01:14:43,133 --> 01:14:45,973
What are you doing?

914
01:14:46,094 --> 01:14:49,932
A repentant soul in Judecca? Stop!

915
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:51,691
Do not utter a word!

916
01:14:51,812 --> 01:14:56,330
But grant me the power
to keep your enemy here with me.

917
01:14:57,373 --> 01:15:00,051
Stop. I command you.

918
01:15:00,171 --> 01:15:03,691
No!

919
01:15:41,087 --> 01:15:42,886
Purgatory.

920
01:16:07,764 --> 01:16:12,002
Beatrice. I will come to you yet.

921
01:16:12,124 --> 01:16:14,882
My love, I have forgiven you.

922
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:19,720
God will forgive you.
Now forgive yourself.

923
01:16:28,282 --> 01:16:32,281
I fought across Earth and Hell
to find my beloved Beatrice.

924
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:37,798
We were together,
neither in Hell nor in Paradise,

925
01:16:37,921 --> 01:16:40,879
neither damned nor saved.

926
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,839
I did not die, and I did not live.
