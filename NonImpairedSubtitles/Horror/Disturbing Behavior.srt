0
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,073
What is your deal?

1
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,903
I got a big game on Friday.

2
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,574
Look, it's no good.
I need my fluids.

3
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,351
Your fluids?

4
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,852
Yeah.

5
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,685
Mary Jo, I'm curious.

6
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,159
Why would you do
something like that?

7
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,153
Why not?

8
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,028
It's self-mutilation, really.

9
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,434
Self-mutilate this, fluid boy.

10
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,215
Good find, girl.

11
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,626
Yeah.

12
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,962
Who's that?

13
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,808
Oh, shit. No.

14
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,535
Slut.

15
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,945
Andy.

16
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,450
You want to step out
for a minute?

17
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,791
You kids shouldn't be out
past curfew.

18
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:04,819
Andy Effkin,
toast with the most.

19
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:09,126
You like our chances
against Knight's Ridge?

20
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,635
We should do fine.

21
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,638
Thrown for a loss.

22
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,606
Is your arm okay
for the game?

23
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,209
- It's good.
- Offensive line up to par?

24
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,270
Son of a bitch.

25
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,479
Fuck.

26
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:34,219
Easy, Eff. Easy, buddy.

27
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:38,559
- I need my fluids.
- Give me the gun.

28
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,301
Get out of here, now.

29
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,407
What?

30
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,874
You gotta be shittin' me.

31
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,547
That's Mary Jo.

32
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:04,084
Clarice, it's Cox.
We got a wet one here on the bluff.

33
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,767
I just can't wait, Steve.

34
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,279
To do what?

35
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:33,080
To see my new room,
my new school, my new everything.

36
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,585
Yeah, new everything.

37
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,257
It's gonna be awesome.

38
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,883
It's gonna be better.

39
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,393
Way better.

40
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,829
Come on.

41
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,997
Looks like you're moving
to Cradle Bay.

42
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:29,064
- We sure are.
- Sure you'll like it here.

43
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:32,907
- You'll never want to leave.
- You hear that?

44
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,541
Hey, you. I thought
you were gonna help me.

45
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,344
Come on.

46
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,850
Fridge.

47
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,352
Thank you.

48
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,894
You all right?

49
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,396
Yeah.

50
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:29,298
Just trying to put
some of this stuff away.

51
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,995
Nervous?

52
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,164
- About what?
- First day at school.

53
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,016
Dad?

54
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,256
What are you doing, dipshit? Don't
worry about snakes in the garden...

55
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,893
when you got spiders
in your bed.

56
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,113
"They had been so innocent
and little there.

57
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:26,454
And all beyond was
so unknown and great."

58
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,124
Very good, Trent.

59
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,959
To wit, when Pip says this...

60
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,659
Dickens is speaking
of the joy of discovery...

61
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:38,135
of newness, of change.

62
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,297
Mr. Clark,
perhaps you can relate.

63
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:44,742
Mr. Clark is new to us from Chicago.
Do they read Dickens in Chicago?

64
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,346
Dickie Atkinson.

65
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,312
Welcome.

66
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,479
Tell us why you're late.
Trouble with the camshaft?

67
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,078
Like you know what one is.

68
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:01,092
Somebody woke up on the wrong side
of the carburetor this morning.

69
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,650
Peckerhead.

70
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,429
What is...
if I may display my ignorance...

71
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,231
a peckerhead?

72
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,431
Why are you laughing, Whalen?

73
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,270
Nothing, Richard.

74
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,902
I was just thinking
how ignorance kills.

75
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:22,573
- What does that mean?
- Exactly.

76
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,110
You ass-kissing little fuck!

77
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,119
Boys!

78
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:37,288
Perhaps yet another little sojourn
to the principal will serve you well?

79
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,590
Want to know what a peckerhead is?

80
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:45,933
- That's a peckerhead.
- Thank you for the clarification.

81
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,667
Please send Principal Weathers
our hosannas!

82
00:11:55,981 --> 00:12:01,578
"Youth is wholly experimental."
Robert Louis Stevenson.

83
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,406
I know.

84
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,787
These seats taken?

85
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,455
No. Go ahead.

86
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,166
I am Gavin. This is U.V.

87
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,874
I'm Steve.

88
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,379
Munchies.

89
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,084
U.V. Has some primo weed.

90
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:11,351
We smoked a fatty during gym.

91
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,756
Check him out.
He looks almost tan.

92
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,892
Hello, Lorna.
How are you today, my dear?

93
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,422
- Drop dead.
- Contact.

94
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:26,528
- Who's that?
- That is Lorna "Love-itis" Longley.

95
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:31,099
Fire of my loins, purveyor
of my every masturbatory fantasy.

96
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:37,277
The entire female gender
is separated into two groups.

97
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:41,308
Lorna comprises one group.
All of womankind comprises the other.

98
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,116
You ever take her out?

99
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:50,158
Alas, Lorna is largely untouchable
for someone of my social standing.

100
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,696
What do you mean?

101
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,927
It's a class system
here at C.B. High, Stevie Boy.

102
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,463
Check it out.

103
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,062
There you got
your motorheads, car jocks.

104
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,768
All the world's a gasket
and a lube job and a pack of Luckys.

105
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,244
Music of choice: Posi-traction
overdrive, classic rock...

106
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,248
Skynyrd, The Allmans, Bruce.

107
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,910
Drug of choice:
Beer, Miller Genuine Draft.

108
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,919
Keggers can't be choosers.

109
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,251
Freaks who fix leaks.

110
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,220
Over here you have
your microgeeks...

111
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:24,888
nerds, whiz kids
and various other bottom feeders.

112
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:28,923
Music of choice:
The sound of an Apple PC booting up.

113
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,697
Drug of choice: Stephen Hawking's
"A Brief History of Time"...

114
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,261
and a cup of jasmine tea
on a Saturday night.

115
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,275
Freaks that go squeak.

116
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,903
Over there you have your skaters.

117
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,447
Riffin', ragin' kids
and their ramp tramps.

118
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,449
Baggy pants, Dickie wools,
doing 50-50 grinds...

119
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:48,611
with a gnarly grab finish
on a homemade halfpipe in the woods.

120
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,554
Music of choice:
The whack of a hacky sack.

121
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:55,993
Drug of choice: Ecstasy, E-tab.
Baby, longer lovin' through science.

122
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,961
Freaks in sneaks.

123
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,425
Here's where it gets really nasty.

124
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:05,800
Lorna runs with that group there,
the Blue Ribbons.

125
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,567
- What's that?
- It's a community group of good kids.

126
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,438
Have bake sales, car washes.

127
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:13,307
- Kiss a lot of adult sphincter.
- Blue Robots.

128
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,574
Here, here.

129
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:19,584
Those three guys: Cradle Bay's answer
to Manson, McVeigh and O.J.

130
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,621
Trent Whalen, Andy Effkin,
Robby Stewart.

131
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:26,749
I bet you didn't know that toast
came in three flavors.

132
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:31,091
This group's music of choice: The hum
of perfection, the buzz of ambition.

133
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:34,428
Drug of choice:
Life, the pursuit of clean living...

134
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,367
at the expense of all who sniffle
at the hem of their gowns.

135
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,927
Freaks, so chic.

136
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,534
Then you got kids
like me and U.V.

137
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,669
Lames who like our metal heavy,
our Marlboros light.

138
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:51,842
Music of choice: Harvester of Sorrow,
Language of the Mad.

139
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,019
Drug of choice:
What do you got?

140
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,147
Freaks all week.

141
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:04,323
That's it.
Lesson over.

142
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,092
Class dismembered.

143
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,794
Welcome to Cradle Bay High,
Stevie Boy.

144
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,893
Welcome to my nightmare.

145
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:41,426
- Why can't we help you with your math?
- Just leave me alone.

146
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,735
Hello.

147
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,600
Phlegm.

148
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:59,110
P-h-l-e-m-g-h.

149
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,553
- Wrong.
- Let me see that.

150
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:07,115
- What are you two doing?
- We're having a spelling bee.

151
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,458
My brother Allen
was the best speller.

152
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,524
- I thought your name was Steve.
- It is.

153
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,233
Allen's my brother who died.

154
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,135
I have a grandfather who died.

155
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,197
Why don't we change the subject?

156
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,437
- Pass your plate.
- Why?

157
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,109
- You know why.
- Nathan.

158
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,718
Shannon, do you get yelled at if you
talk about your dead grandfather?

159
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,316
Around here people go crazy
if you talk about a dead brother.

160
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,387
Hello?

161
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,891
I'm here for the Mustang parts.

162
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,723
What the fuck?

163
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:24,595
What are you doing here?

164
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,540
The troops shall set you free.

165
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,550
What do you guys want?

166
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,950
Sweet Dickie, we want you.

167
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,011
We've got it for you, Richard.

168
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:47,217
We've got all the winning numbers.

169
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:03,535
We like to welcome all new students.
Standard procedure.

170
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:07,670
As soon as Dr. Caldicott arrives,
we can begin.

171
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,509
Doctor?

172
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:12,880
He's the resident faculty fellow,
an outstanding educator.

173
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,715
He's been with us two years now.

174
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:18,221
Works with the students
in a counseling capacity.

175
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,155
I think you'll like him.

176
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,530
I'm sorry I'm late. Hi.
Edgar Caldicott.

177
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,088
It's nice
to finally meet you.

178
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,499
- Everything okay?
- Fine.

179
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:34,369
Have you given any thought
to extracurricular activities or sports?

180
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,168
Not really.

181
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:40,041
- There's the Blue Ribbons.
- The Blue Ribbons?

182
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,774
Yeah. They help each other
study and practice.

183
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,112
It's a team effort.

184
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,118
It's a motivational workshop,
really.

185
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,450
The Blue Ribboners have
truly been making the grade...

186
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,115
and doing wonderful things
on the playing field.

187
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,229
All of us here are aware
of the tragedy back in Chicago.

188
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:02,790
- If there's anything we can do...
- I said everything's fine.

189
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:10,270
Steven,
we know how tough it can be.

190
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,708
Whether or not you want
to be involved with the school...

191
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,405
we want to be involved with you.

192
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:18,142
- That's all the meeting is about.
- Okay.

193
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,310
So go make some new friends.

194
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:11,568
- Like that?
- What is it?

195
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,102
It's bona fide jitterbug.

196
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:18,768
It's my buddy, Rachel.
Cook's Ridge trash.

197
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:24,111
She's a great chick,
but she's Cook's Ridge trash.

198
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,615
Come on.

199
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,681
Dancing queen.

200
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,184
Rachel, this is Stevie Boy.

201
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,782
Good man.

202
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,124
This is Rachel.
Cook's ridge trash.

203
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,628
Bite me.

204
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,530
Wow,
appropriate sparks are flying.

205
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,542
Somebody cue the power ballad.

206
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,043
Fail to be a tumor, Gavin.

207
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,874
What do you say we cruise town,
chase a case...

208
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:03,751
hit the bluff
and drink some beer?

209
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:08,225
Consecrate Stevie Boy's arrival
to this new and pathetic tank town.

210
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:11,785
- You down?
- Sounds razor.

211
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,296
Stevie Boy?

212
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,397
Sure.

213
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,273
Excuse me, sir.
Can you help me out?

214
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,109
- What?
- I'm trying to buy some beer.

215
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,947
I have the money and everything,
I'm just a month from...

216
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,111
Get off my case, kid.

217
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,284
You know,
the problem with America...

218
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,297
is mankind's
abject unwillingness...

219
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,698
to contribute
to the delinquency of minors.

220
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,702
That was like the tenth guy.

221
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,804
- Chug.
- What are you doing?

222
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,408
- Chasing. Nobody's willing.
- Yeah?

223
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:09,318
Hello, Charles.
Cycle any anabolic goodies lately?

224
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:15,148
- You're funny, Strick.
- Thanks. I'm here all week.

225
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:19,721
A couple of us are going to the Yogurt
Shoppe later, if you want to come by.

226
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,995
The Yogurt Shoppe?
Yeah.

227
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:27,835
You want to make an "active culture"
joke here or should I handle this one?

228
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,571
- See you later.
- Bye.

229
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,451
- What?
- What?

230
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:48,186
You're actually flattered
that barn door has a thing for you?

231
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,785
- Bullshit.
- Right.

232
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,898
There's for the syrup.

233
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:04,567
Is that the right one
for the orange juice?

234
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:08,579
Where's the deodorant coupon?
It's here somewhere.

235
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:13,276
- What does a hooker say after 12 hours?
- What?

236
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:20,088
Clean up on aisle four.

237
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,745
Sorry.

238
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,777
Come here!

239
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:07,904
Easy.

240
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,498
Fuck!
You Blue Ribbon shithead!

241
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,351
What was that all about?

242
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,083
Toxic Jock Syndrome.

243
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:29,752
- You'll be fine.
- Where's my shake?

244
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:44,437
What the hell would make a kid
freak out like that?

245
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:48,445
It has to be steroids.
All those jocks are into it.

246
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:52,279
Kelly Connor saw Andy Effkin bite
the head off a kitten in a fit of rage.

247
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,614
- No way.
- I'm serious.

248
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:56,620
I think it's bullshit, though.

249
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:59,657
It is not bullshit,
and it's not steroids.

250
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,056
- Here we go.
- What?

251
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:05,221
Gavin thinks some sinister force is
taking over the Cradle Bay meatheads.

252
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:09,461
- You know what it is.
- A sinister force?

253
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:13,061
You know, evil.
Nowhere to turn, no one to trust.

254
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:17,074
- Fail to be a bitch.
- Fail to be a pucker-ass.

255
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,152
- What?
- Nothing.

256
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,759
Let's go!

257
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,937
Andy killed her.

258
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,440
Everyone's saying she ran away.

259
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:54,770
I saw her dead body,
but I can't prove it.

260
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:59,112
- Those fuckers.
- Why didn't you go to the police?

261
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:02,119
Cox was there, man.

262
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,951
The cop didn't do shit.

263
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,218
Fuck, nobody listens to me.

264
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,228
Cancer Corner.

265
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,231
Best place in the school
to sneak a smoke.

266
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,975
What are you shitbirds
doing down here?

267
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:38,545
- Relax, Mr. Newberry.
- You ain't supposed to be down here!

268
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:41,786
This is my friend, Steve.
He's new to the Bay.

269
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,430
Gnaw, gnaw, gnaw.

270
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,442
Drag marks.

271
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,707
Drag marks of a rat's tail.

272
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,044
What have you got there?

273
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,515
It's an "E-rat-icator."

274
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:10,213
Sounds are supposed
to scare the rats away.

275
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:17,121
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

276
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,891
Scary, ain't it?

277
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:23,764
Piece of crap.
Doesn't work worth spit!

278
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:28,731
A dollar for everything
that didn't work worth spit.

279
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:33,574
Mr. Newberry has the Boo-Radley-
village-idiot-Quasimodo thing going.

280
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,613
- Don't you?
- What?

281
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,409
And he's currently involved...

282
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:40,849
in a war against the rodent population
of Cradle Bay.

283
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,785
Gotta fight them!

284
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,385
Rats from the bay.

285
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:58,302
Incoming! You think you can run,
but you can't hide!

286
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:08,174
- A day at the master races.
- Check that out.

287
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,480
Jesus.

288
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,545
Is that Dickie?
What is he doing?

289
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,922
He's one of them now, bud.

290
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,254
He's a Blue Robot.

291
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,317
Watch and learn.

292
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,328
What the fuck?

293
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:33,793
They're peckerheads. Look at him.
He's killing his hard-on.

294
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,601
Fore!

295
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,073
Maybe he turned over a new leaf.

296
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:41,203
I would like to own the new leaf
concession here in Cradle Bay.

297
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:48,117
Did you tell Steve
about the murders?

298
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,177
Steve is a disbeliever.

299
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:55,192
The mysterious disappearance of Mary Jo
Copeland and Officer Kramer? Uh-huh.

300
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,728
This is where he accuses me
of being paranoid.

301
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:02,290
"Denial" ain't just
a river in Italy, bud.

302
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,603
Check your weed, boys.

303
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:09,834
- You are beige, boy.
- See you, Rachel.

304
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,637
Bye.

305
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:29,115
Here's your chocolate sundae.
Hope you guys...

306
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,462
Can I help you?

307
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:39,401
Steven, good to see you, brother.

308
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,772
Come sit down.

309
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:51,307
Steven, this is Kathy, Andy...

310
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,646
- Tom, Randi...
- Hi.

311
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,152
Lorna, Chug.

312
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,951
You know Robby and Dickie.

313
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,082
This is Steven.
Sit down.

314
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,423
Steven's new to the Bay
from Chicago.

315
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:08,428
- Do you like it here?
- Yeah, it's okay.

316
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:11,263
You had friends in Chicago?

317
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,827
Yeah.

318
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,165
You can have friends here.

319
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,775
Didn't you guys get in a fight
in English?

320
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,784
We've made peace.

321
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:30,286
That's what separates us
from the animals.

322
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:33,784
Dirtbag alert.

323
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:43,861
- I gotta talk to you.
- Easy, slick. Steven's relaxing.

324
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:55,472
The Yogurt Shoppe.
What the fuck is a "shoppy"?

325
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,776
Why don't you
make like a tree and leave?

326
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,977
Clever girl.
Come on, Steve.

327
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,919
We get in one argument,
and you go bond with these guys?

328
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:10,016
What happened to you?
Did you eat too much flank steak?

329
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:21,833
- Let's go.
- You don't have to go, brother.

330
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,009
I'm not your brother.

331
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:40,624
You wanted to tell me something?
Here I am. What?

332
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:44,287
- They're hypnotized.
- What?

333
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:49,299
Maybe not hypnotized, but brainwashed,
lobotomized, programmed.

334
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:53,133
Want proof?
Here. Here's proof.

335
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:58,808
Look.
That's Robby, Randi, Trent.

336
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,707
They used to be my friends.

337
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,409
Maybe they got sick of your rap.
I can relate.

338
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,419
I thought you'd say that. That is
the purpose of tonight's excursion.

339
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,945
After tonight,
you'll strap on a hog and be a man.

340
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,658
It's something that benefits everybody.
The Thespian Society, for example...

341
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:29,104
Blue Ribbon meeting.
Every Monday.

342
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,607
This is where the shit goes down.
Listen.

343
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,941
By conducting the bake sale
in conjunction with the pep rally...

344
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:40,508
we can be selling cakes and cookies
when school spirit is at its optimum.

345
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:44,021
I had no idea
the evil was this pervasive.

346
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,513
Jan, what's on your mind?

347
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,288
This may sound strange, but...

348
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,956
although we couldn't be more pleased
with Andrew's improved studies...

349
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,968
he's become somewhat different...

350
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,563
since returning from your weekend
enlightenment seminar.

351
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,197
Different how?

352
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:07,973
He seems unkind to almost everyone
outside of the club.

353
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,379
I can understand your concern.
Let me address it.

354
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:16,716
Kids being kids
have a tendency to overreact.

355
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:19,382
We've found they go through
a brief period...

356
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,426
of being,
shall we say, snobby.

357
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:27,590
But what it really is
is a feeling that's new to them.

358
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,633
The feeling is pride.

359
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,395
They're improved.

360
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:36,270
When you soar with the eagles,
the pigeons below look pedestrian.

361
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,241
- Give it a little time.
- Dork.

362
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,279
Now, a new candidate
has been nominated.

363
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:45,110
His parents have been counseled
and consented.

364
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,447
Colleen, if you will.

365
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,446
- Male, 17 years old...
- Superstar.

366
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,991
Suspended four times
last school year.

367
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,289
Parents feel
candidate is depressed...

368
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:01,491
spending too much time listening
to rock music and masturbating.

369
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,228
- Candidate has a history of truancy...
- Poor son of a bitch.

370
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:07,396
And a general lack of direction.

371
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:12,569
Candidate is C-minus student,
yet has A-plus potential.

372
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:15,511
All in favor?

373
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:22,286
Great.
February candidate confirmed.

374
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:25,049
- Training to begin ASAP.
- Shit.

375
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,354
- What?
- Join me in welcoming to our circle...

376
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,986
Ernest and Lucille Strick...

377
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:34,088
the parents of our next superstar,
Gavin Strick.

378
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:40,096
They want you to join their club.
Shine them on and blow them off.

379
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:43,106
- What are they gonna do?
- You still don't get it.

380
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:47,270
You still think this is
about blood drives and bake sales.

381
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,780
Wait a second.

382
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,508
Maybe you should
lay off that shit.

383
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,449
Maybe you should eat me.

384
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,613
Yeah.

385
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:02,990
This is huge.
Why don't you see this is fucking huge?

386
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,722
Don't fucking "Gavin" me.
I'm a dead man.

387
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:09,061
My parents sold me out.
You saw it. You were there.

388
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,067
Why don't you see this?

389
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:14,566
Stay at my house tonight.

390
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,340
I have to go home.

391
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:27,578
When I get there and they're waiting for
me, I'll smoke them all. You hear me?

392
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:32,453
Everyone who's at my house:
Robby, Whalen, Caldicott, even my olds.

393
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,083
- Give me the gun.
- No fucking way.

394
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,459
- Let me have it!
- No! You're losing it!

395
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,934
You'll wind up
shooting the paperboy.

396
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,496
- Just go home.
- Give me my fucking gun.

397
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,045
Good night.

398
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,348
Don't leave me alone like this!

399
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,059
Stevie Boy?

400
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:16,066
I would have smoked them all.
Fuck, man.

401
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:49,496
Wait a minute.

402
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,334
- What is this?
- I don't believe...

403
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,069
Show time.

404
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,748
Who put the acid in my Spam?

405
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,899
- Hello.
- What is up with this?

406
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,734
I just want to apply myself.

407
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,570
I think I'll get better results
on this side of the caf.

408
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,736
Beat it, honey.
This is rarefied turf.

409
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,746
Sluts need not apply.

410
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,249
Later.

411
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,057
How much do I owe you?

412
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:57,897
- Treat yourself.
- Indeed.

413
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:09,610
- Where you going?
- I'm going to talk to Gavin.

414
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,342
You're not wanted, Steven.
Just leave him be.

415
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:16,917
Get the fuck off me.

416
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,184
Guys, come on.

417
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,189
What's your maladjustment?

418
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,231
You okay?

419
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,550
Forget it! Stop it!

420
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:54,850
That's enough!

421
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,805
What happened to you?

422
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,874
We shall overcome, Steven.

423
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:23,115
- You okay?
- Man, fantastic.

424
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,464
You'll see.

425
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,309
Retard.

426
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,554
Are you okay?

427
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,471
What are you doing here?

428
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:59,141
You're not supposed to be here.

429
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:02,515
- I hate the caf.
- Everybody hates the caf.

430
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,588
They hate the ketchup.

431
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,248
I got...

432
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,918
That's not good.

433
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,260
Doesn't even look like ketchup.

434
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,764
"Slaughterhouse-Five"?

435
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:18,859
What? Give me that!

436
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,767
What the hell's the matter with you?

437
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:27,937
You rats from the Bay.
You rats!

438
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,775
Rats everywhere.

439
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:33,613
You kids think you know everything!
You don't know nothing!

440
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,618
Forget the rats.
It's all an act.

441
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:37,950
- You don't know.
- It's all bullshit.

442
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,616
Get away from me!

443
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:45,227
Brother!

444
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,677
Wait.

445
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,681
Do you like Kurt Vonnegut?

446
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,032
I don't get it.

447
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:29,700
Didn't you ever want
to just disappear, lunch boy?

448
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,274
Poof, you're gone.

449
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:38,605
You'd be surprised
how interesting people become...

450
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:41,617
when they think
you are really stupid.

451
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:17,250
- Who is it?
- Calm down, Steven.

452
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,757
Where you going, Steven?

453
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:28,423
- There's nothing to be afraid of.
- Here is the light, Steven.

454
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,785
Hello, Steven.

455
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,343
What are you doing here?

456
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:55,256
- I'm tutoring Lindsay in Algebra.
- Where is she?

457
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,228
- Where's my sister?
- She's upstairs sleeping.

458
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,390
- Where are my parents?
- At a meeting.

459
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,400
- What meeting?
- Steven, you're hurt.

460
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:08,234
- I'll live.
- Let me put something on that.

461
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:09,738
It's fine.

462
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:13,909
Maybe you should go.

463
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:16,745
I mean it.

464
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:21,251
- If that's what you want.
- Yeah.

465
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:23,411
Can I go to the bathroom first?

466
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:26,956
Sure.
It's around the corner.

467
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:28,821
I know where it is.

468
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:32,055
Of course you do. Everyone knows
where everything is around here.

469
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:35,621
Your sister's a great kid.
She's very special.

470
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:31,177
Hello, Steven.

471
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:37,384
- What are you doing?
- I'm not sure really.

472
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:40,696
Go home, Lorna.

473
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:47,693
- You don't find me slightly attractive?
- You're very attractive.

474
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:50,365
It's just that you're a Blue Ribbon
and I'm not.

475
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,873
So...

476
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:59,112
Wait a second.

477
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:04,644
I'm not supposed
to be doing this.

478
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,884
It's bad, wrong.

479
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,428
It's not bad. It's...
Jesus Christ.

480
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:57,599
I have to go home.
I have a big physics test tomorrow.

481
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,212
After extracting the implant...

482
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:14,724
I tested its integrity
to the optic nerve, and it was intact.

483
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,816
The chip is functioning properly.

484
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:20,455
But I did find that excess stimulation
to the pineal gland...

485
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,397
caused the dopamine levels
to go through the roof.

486
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:28,794
Every time one of these kids gets
a hard-on, they beat somebody with it.

487
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:30,897
We could do a cingulotomy.

488
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:34,273
No. Cut a craniotomy flap.
I'll get elbow deep, see what happens.

489
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:37,006
- What?
- Cut the bruises out of the banana.

490
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,014
What about her parents?

491
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:43,416
Tell them she'll be missing
cheerleading practice this week.

492
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:49,584
Look. Cook's Ridge trash.

493
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:54,029
Once you've all settled in,
I'm sure she'll fit in just fine.

494
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,429
- Thanks, Dr. Caldicott.
- Did you hear that, Nancy?

495
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,400
Yeah, Mom.

496
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,211
Come on, let's go.
I gotta sell this bud.

497
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,043
I got two customers left.

498
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:15,380
If this keeps up,
I'll be the 7-Eleven guy.

499
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,718
I'm gonna grab a smoke.

500
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:39,106
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

501
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,213
I saw you come down here,
Rachel.

502
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,253
I just want
to ask you something.

503
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:00,896
What do you want?

504
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,438
I just want to know...

505
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:12,339
It's me asking, not my friends.

506
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,002
Will you go out with me?

507
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:22,684
You're kidding, right?

508
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,289
Will you, please?

509
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,584
No, Chug, I won't.

510
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,355
Why not?

511
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:36,565
How about this?

512
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:39,966
You couldn't repulse me more if you
were made out of shit and maggots!

513
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,868
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

514
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:44,907
- You want to be that way?
- Stop it. I'll scream. I swear to God.

515
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,408
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

516
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:48,103
What will happen if you do?

517
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:50,476
I'm a Blue Ribbon, baby.
Team captain.

518
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,744
You're just a trashy,
tattooed love doll.

519
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:56,877
Come on, Rae-Rae, give up
the plate for Chug. Come on!

520
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,289
Fuck!

521
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,238
Stop it!

522
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:49,198
What you looking at, retard?

523
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,390
Wow.

524
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:14,925
I guess I just think
you should try and fit in.

525
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:17,432
We're gonna be here
for a long time.

526
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,435
You, me, Mom and Dad.

527
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:21,937
And Chip and Dale.

528
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,070
- What is this?
- What?

529
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,137
- Where did you get this?
- I got it at school.

530
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:34,047
They were handing them out.
We all got one.

531
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:40,783
- Go inside.
- Why?

532
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:46,884
- I said go inside!
- Spaz.

533
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:28,504
- We should talk.
- Yeah.

534
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,774
There's something
you need to see.

535
00:53:43,776 --> 00:53:46,267
Rae, Gavin Strick here.

536
00:53:48,581 --> 00:53:50,515
Live and unplugged.

537
00:53:53,052 --> 00:53:56,112
Guess if you found this,
then you know.

538
00:53:57,624 --> 00:53:59,922
Am I hanging
with Trent and Robby...

539
00:53:59,993 --> 00:54:02,553
and the rest of the Robots?

540
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:05,695
God, I hope not.

541
00:54:08,768 --> 00:54:12,704
I hit the vents tonight
when I split up with Stevie Boy.

542
00:54:12,772 --> 00:54:15,206
He doesn't believe.

543
00:54:15,275 --> 00:54:16,867
I went back to school...

544
00:54:16,943 --> 00:54:20,674
and I overheard Caldicott
talking to some wonk.

545
00:54:20,747 --> 00:54:23,773
Mentioned "Bishop Flats Eleven."

546
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:27,684
Caldicott called them his children.

547
00:54:27,754 --> 00:54:30,552
Then he freaked out on the guy
and kicked him out of his office.

548
00:54:30,623 --> 00:54:32,716
So, I figure something's up
with that.

549
00:54:36,429 --> 00:54:40,991
Keep an eye on U.V. For me,
though I doubt they'll want him.

550
00:54:41,067 --> 00:54:45,128
I doubt they're interested
in the pigmentally challenged.

551
00:54:45,205 --> 00:54:46,638
That's not their style.

552
00:54:50,376 --> 00:54:52,844
I have to go get paranoid.

553
00:54:54,214 --> 00:54:55,647
This is Gavin Strick...

554
00:54:55,715 --> 00:54:59,913
reporting live
from The Reconstruction.

555
00:55:06,926 --> 00:55:08,860
I pulled this off the AMA database.

556
00:55:09,963 --> 00:55:11,396
Caldicott's last
place of employment...

557
00:55:11,464 --> 00:55:14,228
was across the bay
in Bishop Flats...

558
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,200
at the Bellknop Psychiatric Facility.

559
00:55:17,303 --> 00:55:20,739
He spent seven years
doing neuropharmacology.

560
00:55:20,807 --> 00:55:22,240
Mind control.

561
00:55:26,246 --> 00:55:27,679
Next ferry's at 6:00.

562
00:55:30,283 --> 00:55:33,047
- Bishop Flats?
- You down for it?

563
00:55:40,226 --> 00:55:41,659
Razor.

564
00:55:41,728 --> 00:55:43,161
Let's go.

565
00:55:50,136 --> 00:55:53,572
- I miss Gavin. He's almost like a...
- A brother?

566
00:55:56,709 --> 00:55:58,643
Yeah, exactly.

567
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,418
I had a brother.

568
00:56:11,124 --> 00:56:12,853
Sorry.

569
00:56:12,925 --> 00:56:17,487
His name was Allen.
He was a couple years older than me.

570
00:56:17,563 --> 00:56:21,294
If he had made it through his teens,
he would have been amazing.

571
00:56:22,568 --> 00:56:25,696
But he was always in pain.

572
00:56:29,442 --> 00:56:33,037
And eight months
to the day he shot himself...

573
00:56:33,112 --> 00:56:35,376
Dad said we were moving
to Cradle Bay...

574
00:56:39,686 --> 00:56:42,450
where everything
was gonna be all right.

575
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:49,259
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't.

576
00:56:52,832 --> 00:56:54,322
Let's go.

577
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:12,277
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

578
00:57:16,422 --> 00:57:18,014
Think of it
as our first date.

579
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:20,141
That's why my toothes are clean.

580
00:58:24,891 --> 00:58:26,358
Be pretty...

581
00:58:26,426 --> 00:58:30,522
and do it just right.

582
00:58:39,605 --> 00:58:41,937
Children.

583
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:51,043
Meet the musical little creatures...

584
00:58:51,117 --> 00:58:53,051
that hide among the flowers.

585
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,553
Shut up.

586
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,799
Let's get out of here.

587
00:59:57,383 --> 00:59:59,317
It's Caldicott's daughter.

588
01:00:25,478 --> 01:00:27,708
His own daughter.

589
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:30,772
How can nobody not know there's
something fucked up in Bishop Flat?

590
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:33,717
Shit, his own daughter was in there.
Nobody's safe.

591
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:46,794
The last ferry leaves at 11:30.

592
01:00:46,866 --> 01:00:48,959
Tell me you have a razor plan.

593
01:00:49,035 --> 01:00:54,132
- I am making this shit up as I go.
- Great.

594
01:01:02,715 --> 01:01:04,148
Shit.

595
01:01:23,402 --> 01:01:24,994
Hi, Officer Cox.

596
01:01:25,071 --> 01:01:26,936
Closing time, Frankie.

597
01:01:27,006 --> 01:01:29,338
Yeah, it's getting late.

598
01:01:29,408 --> 01:01:31,342
Just be cool.

599
01:01:35,548 --> 01:01:37,072
It's past curfew.

600
01:01:37,149 --> 01:01:39,083
She's driving me home.

601
01:01:41,053 --> 01:01:42,918
- From?
- Studying.

602
01:01:45,891 --> 01:01:47,756
Where are your books?

603
01:02:09,982 --> 01:02:13,213
- Evening, Officer.
- What are you doing?

604
01:02:13,285 --> 01:02:15,810
I'm getting rid of rats.

605
01:02:16,989 --> 01:02:21,892
The pink-eyed vermin
can't see for spit.

606
01:02:21,961 --> 01:02:23,553
Quarter a rat.

607
01:02:23,629 --> 01:02:27,065
Town council gives me
a quarter a rat.

608
01:02:28,334 --> 01:02:32,065
I'm going to be rich at this rate.
I'll be on...

609
01:02:32,138 --> 01:02:34,606
- "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous."
- Moron.

610
01:02:38,177 --> 01:02:41,510
- Where are you going?
- Can we go now?

611
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:44,105
Step out of the truck, now.

612
01:02:49,655 --> 01:02:52,146
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

613
01:02:53,259 --> 01:02:56,228
Let her go!
What do you want from us?

614
01:02:56,295 --> 01:02:58,263
Get in here.

615
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:06,001
That's a big rat.

616
01:03:11,277 --> 01:03:15,976
Come on, get out of there!
What are you waiting for? Get!

617
01:03:22,855 --> 01:03:24,288
Let's get out of here.

618
01:03:34,033 --> 01:03:36,126
Come on, Steve.

619
01:03:47,246 --> 01:03:50,807
You have to trust me for now.
Do you trust me?

620
01:03:55,755 --> 01:03:57,347
Where are you going?

621
01:03:58,858 --> 01:04:02,021
I'm taking Lindsay away from here.
We're going back to Chicago.

622
01:04:02,094 --> 01:04:05,552
- Don't do this. You're scaring me.
- I'm scared too, Mom, believe me.

623
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:08,600
Stevie, you have to know
we're here for you no matter what.

624
01:04:12,671 --> 01:04:15,970
- God, do you really mean that?
- Of course we do.

625
01:04:16,041 --> 01:04:21,445
- Then let's all go home.
- Steven, you are home.

626
01:04:21,514 --> 01:04:25,883
Cradle Bay is where you belong.
Here with your family.

627
01:04:25,951 --> 01:04:27,612
You signed me up
for the program?

628
01:04:27,686 --> 01:04:30,177
- We want what's best for you.
- What about what I want?

629
01:04:30,256 --> 01:04:33,157
Look, Steven,
do you really like the way you feel?

630
01:04:33,225 --> 01:04:35,386
Shut the fuck up!

631
01:04:35,461 --> 01:04:38,021
You sold me out.

632
01:04:38,097 --> 01:04:40,827
- We didn't. We just want you back.
- Steven, please...

633
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,595
My name is Steve, okay?

634
01:04:42,668 --> 01:04:44,898
Nobody calls me Steven
except for them.

635
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:50,267
Fine. Come on, Linds.

636
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:06,688
May I have this dance?

637
01:05:06,759 --> 01:05:08,351
Where's Rachel?

638
01:05:08,427 --> 01:05:11,089
She's gone to an institute
of higher learning, Steven.

639
01:05:15,134 --> 01:05:18,467
- Help!
- Everything's under control.

640
01:05:19,405 --> 01:05:20,463
Who's your daddy?

641
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:39,690
Respect yourself, Steven.

642
01:05:41,794 --> 01:05:43,728
Ice, ice, baby.

643
01:05:51,704 --> 01:05:53,968
It's not what you think.

644
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:56,439
It's a new kind of cool.

645
01:05:56,508 --> 01:05:58,703
You feel better, freer.

646
01:05:58,777 --> 01:06:01,507
I've never felt so alive
in my life.

647
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:05,277
- It's humanity's sacred essence.
- A new and finer age.

648
01:06:05,351 --> 01:06:06,682
Go forward.

649
01:06:09,788 --> 01:06:11,619
Be the ball.

650
01:06:57,036 --> 01:06:59,231
People will know
when I get out of here.

651
01:06:59,305 --> 01:07:01,637
That's right, they will know.

652
01:07:01,707 --> 01:07:04,335
They'll know
because you'll be better.

653
01:07:06,712 --> 01:07:08,646
Adolescence is a minefield.

654
01:07:10,816 --> 01:07:15,310
But soon, you'll be fully equipped
to walk right through it.

655
01:07:15,387 --> 01:07:17,947
Yeah, straight A's
and a letter jacket.

656
01:07:18,023 --> 01:07:20,150
And every now and then,
you rape and kill.

657
01:07:20,225 --> 01:07:22,557
To cure cancer,
you gotta kill a few white mice.

658
01:07:23,762 --> 01:07:27,254
Meet the musical
little creatures...

659
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:28,800
that hide among the flowers.

660
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:33,804
That's a battle I didn't win.

661
01:07:36,942 --> 01:07:40,537
You'll be different.

662
01:07:40,612 --> 01:07:43,046
I know so much more now.

663
01:07:45,351 --> 01:07:48,286
She wasn't that bright
to begin with.

664
01:07:56,996 --> 01:07:59,191
Be all that's good.

665
01:07:59,264 --> 01:08:01,323
Stop fooling around.

666
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,595
Let the light in.

667
01:08:11,176 --> 01:08:15,579
Be excellent.
You're number one. You're an ace.

668
01:08:16,815 --> 01:08:18,248
Achieve.

669
01:09:25,751 --> 01:09:27,685
You'll be okay.

670
01:09:51,677 --> 01:09:53,770
Going somewhere
with my custard, Steven?

671
01:09:56,982 --> 01:09:58,472
Let's go, Chug.

672
01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:01,383
That's my girl you got there.

673
01:10:01,453 --> 01:10:03,216
I can't let you take her.

674
01:10:12,397 --> 01:10:13,955
Come on! Get up!

675
01:10:24,309 --> 01:10:27,244
Come on, Rae-Rae,
give up the plate for old Chug.

676
01:10:43,328 --> 01:10:44,761
Come on.

677
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:03,774
- Not so fast.
- What?

678
01:11:03,849 --> 01:11:06,010
What's the capital
of North Dakota?

679
01:11:06,084 --> 01:11:07,813
How the fuck should I know?

680
01:11:08,887 --> 01:11:10,980
Okay, you're cool.
Get in.

681
01:11:11,056 --> 01:11:14,787
We gotta book.
Early bird ferry's in 20 minutes.

682
01:11:30,475 --> 01:11:32,500
Shit, man.

683
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:54,128
It's time
to leave mediocrity behind.

684
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,724
Step up on the bus.

685
01:12:09,448 --> 01:12:10,881
What is it?

686
01:12:36,008 --> 01:12:38,442
Come and get it,
you blue bastards!

687
01:12:44,516 --> 01:12:46,541
What is going on?

688
01:12:47,853 --> 01:12:49,946
Come on.

689
01:12:50,022 --> 01:12:51,956
Get them to the ferry.

690
01:12:53,859 --> 01:12:55,793
I'll meet you down there.

691
01:13:00,032 --> 01:13:01,124
Don't leave without me.

692
01:13:25,324 --> 01:13:27,884
- Lunch boy.
- What are you doing?

693
01:13:27,959 --> 01:13:33,226
We can't very well
have these shitbirds...

694
01:13:33,298 --> 01:13:35,232
graduating and going off
into the world.

695
01:13:36,134 --> 01:13:37,761
Maybe they can be helped.

696
01:13:37,836 --> 01:13:41,135
No, they can't.
And neither can I.

697
01:13:44,476 --> 01:13:47,741
Do good things, lunch boy.

698
01:14:00,492 --> 01:14:03,325
Hey, teacher!

699
01:14:05,163 --> 01:14:06,824
Leave those kids alone!

700
01:14:25,484 --> 01:14:29,477
It's over, you son of a bitch.
It's finished.

701
01:14:29,554 --> 01:14:30,987
"Finished"?

702
01:14:32,824 --> 01:14:34,621
There will always be other towns...

703
01:14:34,693 --> 01:14:37,059
and other troubled teens...

704
01:14:37,129 --> 01:14:38,653
and other worried parents.

705
01:14:38,730 --> 01:14:40,857
Science is God.

706
01:15:11,096 --> 01:15:13,030
Be the ball.

707
01:16:03,181 --> 01:16:07,379
- What happened?
- We're the only ones left.

708
01:16:11,723 --> 01:16:13,657
So, what do we do now?

709
01:16:15,126 --> 01:16:17,060
We go home.

710
01:16:19,097 --> 01:16:20,621
And where's that?

711
01:16:23,201 --> 01:16:25,396
Wherever.

712
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:27,495
Wherever we are.

713
01:16:31,843 --> 01:16:34,869
Appropriate sparks are flying.

714
01:16:36,515 --> 01:16:39,006
Somebody cue up
the power ballad, man.

715
01:16:58,103 --> 01:16:59,900
All right now, settle down.

716
01:16:59,971 --> 01:17:02,030
Turn that damn thing off.

717
01:17:02,107 --> 01:17:05,042
Now, y'all got a new student teacher
starting today.

718
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:08,204
I want you to show him a little bit
more respect than the last one.

719
01:17:09,548 --> 01:17:10,981
Speak of the devil.

720
01:17:24,896 --> 01:17:28,263
Say hello to your
new student teacher, class.

721
01:17:30,969 --> 01:17:32,527
They're all yours.

722
01:17:32,604 --> 01:17:34,094
Peckerhead.

723
01:17:38,877 --> 01:17:41,675
Hello, class.
Welcome.

724
01:23:16,781 --> 01:23:19,545
Be excellent.

725
01:23:19,617 --> 01:23:23,383
Yes. Wonderful.

726
01:23:26,124 --> 01:23:30,720
Meet the musical
little creatures...

727
01:23:30,795 --> 01:23:33,229
that hide in the flowers.

728
01:23:34,799 --> 01:23:36,232
Treat yourself.

729
01:23:36,301 --> 01:23:38,826
