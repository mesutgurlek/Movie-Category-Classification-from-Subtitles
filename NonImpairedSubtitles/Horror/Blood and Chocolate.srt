1
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:37,937
<i>When we are chiIdren,
we beIieve the worId is fuII of magic.</i>

2
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:46,837
<i>We beIieve in myths and Iegends,
and that destiny awaits.</i>

3
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:51,956
<i>That is the worId I remember</i>

4
00:00:54,268 --> 00:00:56,473
<i>and the one I wish I'd never known.</i>

5
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,843
<i>-Someone's there.
-Back in the house.</i>

6
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,033
Daddy!

7
00:01:32,932 --> 00:01:33,880
Mommy!

8
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:36,035
Vivian, run!

9
00:03:40,473 --> 00:03:42,863
Running. Always running.

10
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:45,043
<i>Never know when you're gonna need it.</i>

11
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:48,431
<i>Vivian, when he comes,
he'll expect you to be here.</i>

12
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:50,202
<i>Well, l won't be.</i>

13
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:52,503
<i>lt's an honor to be chosen, if it is you.</i>

14
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:55,670
And when he leaves you,
is that an honor, too?

15
00:03:57,115 --> 00:03:59,287
These are the ways of our people.

16
00:03:59,356 --> 00:04:00,950
<i>l don't need your advice today, Aunt Astrid.</i>

17
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:03,509
Oh, baby, you need something.

18
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:05,653
l remember being 19, you know.

19
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:07,286
<i>You're still 19.</i>

20
00:04:07,518 --> 00:04:08,631
Funny.

21
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:12,343
When l was 19, l was pregnant.
lt was my choice.

22
00:04:12,415 --> 00:04:15,285
<i>And what l found was it's best to stay
where you belong.</i>

23
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,431
lf you know where you belong.

24
00:04:17,504 --> 00:04:21,695
We have a home here, Vivian, a safe one.
Thanks to Gabriel.

25
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:27,037
Your parents would have wanted you safe.
And you are.

26
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:31,200
<i>lt's only you you're running from.</i>

27
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:39,226
Are you sure this is the right address?

28
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,472
Yes, it has to be.

29
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:29,891
Vivian. Do you see anything you like?

30
00:05:30,637 --> 00:05:33,572
<i>-Just here to drink, Drago.
-That's what they all say.</i>

31
00:06:16,564 --> 00:06:18,059
ln your dreams.

32
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:27,444
<i>She's shy.</i>

33
00:06:32,088 --> 00:06:35,885
<i>Don't give up, cousin. l think she likes you.
l see a real future there.</i>

34
00:06:36,344 --> 00:06:37,719
Sweet of you to say.

35
00:06:37,784 --> 00:06:41,200
A ring, a church wedding,
all her family would show.

36
00:06:41,273 --> 00:06:44,023
<i>And then for the reception,
you'd kill them all.</i>

37
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:46,169
<i>l know. lt'd be magical.</i>

38
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,450
<i>You know what we are, Vivian?
We're romantics.</i>

39
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:52,978
<i>''We'' are nothing.</i>

40
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,184
And the thing about romantics is

41
00:06:59,676 --> 00:07:01,367
they never give up.

42
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:03,803
Hey.

43
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:06,906
Yes, on top is how l imagine you.

44
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:08,981
That looks fun. Can l be next?

45
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,158
Absinthe all around. Her, too.

46
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,133
<i>Well. Out from their caves,
if it isn't the Fortunate Five.</i>

47
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:15,155
<i>We're in luck, gents.</i>

48
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:17,206
My cousin deigns
to honor us with her presence.

49
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,149
-Are you here to dance, Vivian?
-Dance. Yeah. Shake your pretty tail.

50
00:07:20,224 --> 00:07:22,941
<i>l'd like to see how you'll dance for Gabriel.</i>

51
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:28,732
My cousin, you know you will.

52
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,505
<i>Seven years, it's almost time.</i>

53
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:36,096
He has other girls to choose from.

54
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:39,097
None like you.

55
00:07:41,923 --> 00:07:44,771
To darling Vivian. Pride of the pack.

56
00:07:44,835 --> 00:07:47,356
-And her bright future.
-Vivian!

57
00:07:51,174 --> 00:07:52,351
Vivian.

58
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:07,662
Hello?

59
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:11,370
ls there somebody in here?

60
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:14,665
<i>ls there somebody in here?
You're asking me?</i>

61
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:20,559
Since when do they lock churches
in this country, huh?

62
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:25,811
This is a sacred place. Protected.

63
00:09:25,878 --> 00:09:28,017
<i>Well, l didn't steal anything.</i>

64
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:30,356
You an American?

65
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,600
<i>Look, l don't need any trouble.</i>

66
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,771
l heard about this place.
l had to find a way in.

67
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:52,561
What is this?

68
00:09:53,499 --> 00:09:56,281
<i>They're figure studies for a graphic novel.</i>

69
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:00,149
Like...

70
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,569
Like these.

71
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:08,595
-Which one has the wolves?
-The next one.

72
00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:12,950
<i>My name's Aiden. Aiden Galvin.</i>

73
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:14,811
<i>l'm here for research.</i>

74
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:16,662
And trespassing.

75
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,948
Look. Bucharest is a treasure trove.

76
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,984
<i>l'd heard there were places
that wolves were almost, like, worshipped.</i>

77
00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:28,569
<i>But l didn't think they meant it literally.</i>

78
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:31,641
<i>Strictly speaking,
they're not actually wolves.</i>

79
00:10:31,745 --> 00:10:33,884
<i>They were called Ioup-garous.</i>

80
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:37,278
You mean werewolves.

81
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:39,993
Not as you and l think of them.

82
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,251
<i>They weren't monsters,
not in the legends here.</i>

83
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,570
-What were they, then?
-They were revered.

84
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:52,131
They were the best of man,
the best of beast.

85
00:10:52,197 --> 00:10:55,645
Kind of shape-shifters, l guess.
Until they were wiped out.

86
00:10:55,749 --> 00:10:57,473
ln the legends.

87
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,734
-So your comic book...
-Graphic novel.

88
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,847
<i>lt's not about monsters?</i>

89
00:11:13,577 --> 00:11:15,366
Just us humans, right?

90
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:21,314
Hey, were you hiding or something?
What are you doing here?

91
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:25,322
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait.
l'm leaving, all right, l'm outta here.</i>

92
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:27,209
Just tell me your name.

93
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:30,627
You do have a name, right?

94
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:34,087
Do they have names?

95
00:11:37,388 --> 00:11:38,818
Why should we?

96
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:42,790
<i>lt's bad luck to break into a church.</i>

97
00:11:43,405 --> 00:11:44,999
<i>Hey, what's your name?</i>

98
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,177
<i>l don't want to come.</i>

99
00:11:59,697 --> 00:12:02,567
Go. Go, go, go!

100
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:55,511
Let me in! Help! Please!

101
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:07,284
Get out of here.

102
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:22,044
<i>Oh, come on now, cousin.
lt's not like we were going to hurt her.</i>

103
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:25,179
You have to let the boys have their fun.

104
00:13:25,248 --> 00:13:26,840
You know the law.

105
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:28,537
The law.

106
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:31,260
<i>What's one girl, right? And another.</i>

107
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:33,785
<i>When they come,
they'll come in numbers with guns.</i>

108
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:35,898
<i>And not just for you.
They'll come for all of us.</i>

109
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,758
<i>Spoken like a bitch who's been there.</i>

110
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:41,504
<i>We weren't gonna hurt her, Vivian.
We were just playing games.</i>

111
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,480
We know the risks, Vivian, same as you.

112
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:46,752
<i>Yes, see, we all know Gabriel's law.</i>

113
00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:50,715
<i>-''Hunt as a pack or not at all.''
-''Hunt as a pack or not at all.''</i>

114
00:13:54,244 --> 00:13:56,252
<i>And the laws he'll have for you.</i>

115
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:06,909
<i>She's asleep.</i>

116
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:11,586
Gabriel,

117
00:14:13,448 --> 00:14:15,750
she stayed home waiting for you.

118
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:20,165
Are you afraid of me?

119
00:14:21,386 --> 00:14:22,334
No.

120
00:14:26,058 --> 00:14:28,066
You know about our tradition.

121
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:31,009
Every seven years,
the leader of the pack takes a new wife.

122
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,774
<i>Don't you mean mate?</i>

123
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:39,079
Should show more respect for the rules.
Without them we cannot survive.

124
00:14:40,205 --> 00:14:41,896
There are prophecies

125
00:14:42,989 --> 00:14:44,900
about girls like you.

126
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,824
You come from a long line of leaders,
you know.

127
00:14:50,894 --> 00:14:54,026
Women in your family
were legends in this city.

128
00:14:55,183 --> 00:14:57,965
Your father should never have gone
to America.

129
00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:59,974
l knew how he would end. l told him.

130
00:15:00,048 --> 00:15:01,958
You must have hated him very much.

131
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:04,968
No.
But you know why we have survived here?

132
00:15:06,545 --> 00:15:08,750
<i>lt's because we stand together.</i>

133
00:15:09,586 --> 00:15:12,073
Your father thought of himself first.

134
00:15:12,915 --> 00:15:14,541
<i>Don't insult my family.</i>

135
00:15:14,611 --> 00:15:17,197
You have no family. You have heritage.

136
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:31,947
<i>lf you're the one from the prophesy,</i>

137
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,701
soon l will ask you to be my wife.

138
00:15:37,943 --> 00:15:39,983
l see what you did to Astrid.

139
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:43,149
You come for one night,
she cries for a month.

140
00:15:43,224 --> 00:15:46,224
<i>You want to be ordinary?
You're not ordinary.</i>

141
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:53,678
Ask the animal who is inside you.
She will teach you.

142
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:38,490
Fear.

143
00:16:41,218 --> 00:16:43,520
Was l not worthy of your respect?

144
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,993
No trace of admiration?

145
00:16:52,836 --> 00:16:56,098
<i>That's because you don't know the real me.</i>

146
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,809
Hey, scumbag, you are free to go.

147
00:17:46,574 --> 00:17:50,829
Detectives? Where are you taking me? Huh?

148
00:17:50,894 --> 00:17:53,709
What is this? Where are you taking me?

149
00:18:18,228 --> 00:18:20,945
My friend, your arrest has made the paper.

150
00:18:22,131 --> 00:18:23,626
You must be very proud.

151
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,515
What is this? And who are you?

152
00:18:27,957 --> 00:18:30,062
Please, have a drink with me.

153
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,773
<i>Absinthe, it's an old ritual of mine.</i>

154
00:18:38,391 --> 00:18:40,726
Why did you pay to get me out?

155
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:43,500
Drink.

156
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,161
You know, there are countries
where they call this poison.

157
00:18:54,554 --> 00:18:58,962
<i>Of course, it doesn't come in a dirty needle.
And it's not sold to children.</i>

158
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,731
What you want? You want a cut?

159
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:06,265
You want in?

160
00:19:06,332 --> 00:19:09,977
My friend,
you have escaped the law till now.

161
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:12,658
But in this city, we are the law.

162
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:15,863
As we have been for 5,000 years.

163
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:24,243
<i>We'll find out
who you've been selling your poison to.</i>

164
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:27,549
For tomorrow, tradition reigns.

165
00:19:31,489 --> 00:19:34,008
Well, that makes all the difference.

166
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:58,586
<i>-Your chocolates.
-That's so nice. Thanks.</i>

167
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,424
Hey! Hey, Wolf-Girl!

168
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,677
Hello, sweet tooth. Ready to hunt?

169
00:22:40,098 --> 00:22:43,262
All hail the queen of the night,
the beauty of Bucharest!

170
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,403
She will hunt and hunt supreme.

171
00:22:45,474 --> 00:22:47,132
Mama.

172
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:56,958
<i>Willem, so he's chasing the meat, right?</i>

173
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:59,517
<i>Lands on it, turns it around, it's Gregor.</i>

174
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:02,468
-Did l tell you?
-No, l had no idea.

175
00:23:02,534 --> 00:23:03,678
l had no idea.

176
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:22,369
Hell of a night.

177
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,541
<i>''ln fear l hurried this way and that.</i>

178
00:23:58,606 --> 00:24:01,771
<i>''l had the taste of blood and chocolate
in my mouth,</i>

179
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:05,418
<i>''the one as hateful as the other.''
Remember that?</i>

180
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,246
<i>SteppenwoIf.</i>

181
00:24:07,888 --> 00:24:10,059
<i>We're all lost souls, Vivian.</i>

182
00:24:11,921 --> 00:24:14,224
<i>At least we're lost together.</i>

183
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:58,640
My lords and ladies,

184
00:24:58,713 --> 00:25:01,911
we gather tonight
as our ancestors did for all time.

185
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:05,945
The first night of the full moon
when we gather as one.

186
00:25:06,106 --> 00:25:07,568
For we are one.

187
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,741
And we hunt as one.

188
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,920
We have survived for 5,000 years
by hiding who we are.

189
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:22,582
We have been chased from everywhere,
England, France, America,

190
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:25,171
but not here.

191
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,324
Never here.

192
00:25:29,822 --> 00:25:32,670
This thing before you

193
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:36,598
is called man.

194
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,318
But l call it menace.

195
00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:44,506
The race of man is corrupt at its core.

196
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:48,125
<i>The only thing it's good at is destruction!</i>

197
00:25:48,194 --> 00:25:50,616
And so, once in a while,
we must make an example

198
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:53,887
to show this menace
that we may be outnumbered,

199
00:25:54,243 --> 00:25:56,513
but we will never be outhunted.

200
00:26:08,742 --> 00:26:10,335
So on this night,

201
00:26:13,062 --> 00:26:15,201
let nature grace us to return

202
00:26:15,847 --> 00:26:17,570
to who we truly are

203
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:21,695
in the wild where we once lived.

204
00:26:36,587 --> 00:26:38,475
Please. l swear...

205
00:26:38,635 --> 00:26:41,023
There is a river within those woods.

206
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,482
lf you reach the other side,
you win your life.

207
00:26:45,932 --> 00:26:47,427
And if not,

208
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,250
<i>glory to the Ioup-garou who takes it.</i>

209
00:26:57,486 --> 00:26:58,697
Run free.

210
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:06,029
No one ever reaches the river.

211
00:28:24,253 --> 00:28:25,497
Help me!

212
00:29:34,538 --> 00:29:36,099
<i>lt's who you are</i>

213
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:39,077
and always will be.

214
00:30:26,515 --> 00:30:29,101
Help! Help!

215
00:31:15,323 --> 00:31:19,797
<i>Bunâ, any mail for me? Letters, packages?
l'm in 204.</i>

216
00:31:20,028 --> 00:31:21,490
No mail today.

217
00:31:22,364 --> 00:31:23,958
Did you even check?

218
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:25,943
No mail for nobody.

219
00:31:34,334 --> 00:31:35,350
<i>Where'd you get this?</i>

220
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,412
Yes, l am being careful. Thank you.

221
00:31:40,992 --> 00:31:43,097
<i>Why don't you go sell something
for a change?</i>

222
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:50,041
<i>lt's not gonna taste any better
with you standing there watching me.</i>

223
00:31:50,114 --> 00:31:51,575
Hey, Wolf-Girl.

224
00:31:54,114 --> 00:31:56,002
<i>Don't ever call me that.</i>

225
00:31:56,162 --> 00:31:58,651
So give me something else to call you.

226
00:31:58,723 --> 00:32:00,414
How did you find me?

227
00:32:00,643 --> 00:32:01,853
Find who?

228
00:32:03,652 --> 00:32:04,797
Vivian.

229
00:32:06,277 --> 00:32:07,454
<i>Look, l'm working. l can't talk.</i>

230
00:32:07,524 --> 00:32:09,412
<i>And l really don't think
you should be back here.</i>

231
00:32:09,477 --> 00:32:11,103
So ask me to leave.

232
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:15,227
Leave.

233
00:32:17,415 --> 00:32:19,520
Now ask me like you mean it.

234
00:32:19,654 --> 00:32:21,956
<i>What's it been, two, three weeks?</i>

235
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:24,445
What are you still doing in Romania?

236
00:32:24,807 --> 00:32:26,302
Trying to work.

237
00:32:28,391 --> 00:32:31,557
<i>-Don't you have a home to go back to?
-No, l don't.</i>

238
00:32:32,489 --> 00:32:34,594
But l do have a train ticket in a few days.

239
00:32:34,665 --> 00:32:37,601
And l was hoping
to spend some of them with you.

240
00:32:38,026 --> 00:32:41,507
<i>Yeah, well, that wouldn't make my boyfriend
really happy.</i>

241
00:32:41,738 --> 00:32:42,686
Oh.

242
00:32:44,651 --> 00:32:48,679
Would you be at a church at 2:00
in the morning if you had a boyfriend?

243
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,573
<i>Why do you always run from me?
That's twice now, you've run from me.</i>

244
00:32:57,645 --> 00:32:59,619
Are my drawings that bad?

245
00:33:02,062 --> 00:33:05,707
-You have to go.
-That is starting to sound like you mean it.

246
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,224
What do you want with me?

247
00:33:09,296 --> 00:33:13,257
l wanna know who you are
and what you love and what you dream.

248
00:33:13,328 --> 00:33:15,336
l want to know
what you were doing there that night.

249
00:33:15,408 --> 00:33:16,902
And l should just tell you?

250
00:33:16,976 --> 00:33:20,294
<i>This coming from a guy who doesn't even
put his name on his comic books?</i>

251
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,093
You read my books?

252
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:23,688
l guess the library is out
of everything else, huh?

253
00:33:23,762 --> 00:33:25,169
You need to leave now.

254
00:33:25,233 --> 00:33:26,827
<i>One night. That's all l'm asking.</i>

255
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:30,696
Otherwise, l will be here,
all day, every day, buying chocolates.

256
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:34,057
Piata Romana. Tomorrow night, 7:00.

257
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:35,721
7:00.

258
00:33:36,276 --> 00:33:38,665
<i>lt's for you, Wolf-Girl.</i>

259
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:44,466
Hi. Health inspector.

260
00:33:51,831 --> 00:33:54,766
<i>-What's that?
-Trash.</i>

261
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:08,976
Give me that.

262
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:12,727
What, your trash? Your human trash?
Now, why would...

263
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:15,674
<i>-Oh, well, now.
-He doesn't know.</i>

264
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:17,463
Well, that much seems obvious.

265
00:34:17,532 --> 00:34:19,222
<i>He's drawing pictures
for a book on Ioup-garous.</i>

266
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,885
l showed interest.

267
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,766
-Did you?
-Not like that.

268
00:34:23,837 --> 00:34:25,877
<i>No? Didn't model your tail for him?</i>

269
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:28,405
<i>He doesn't know, Rafe. Leave him alone.</i>

270
00:34:28,478 --> 00:34:30,517
<i>Now, cousin, why wouldn't l?</i>

271
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:36,372
<i>You want to have a meat-boy, l don't care.
l don't care if you have 100.</i>

272
00:34:36,831 --> 00:34:39,766
<i>Just don't tell any stories
that you shouldn't.</i>

273
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:43,839
<i>They're good for fun, you know, pretty ones.</i>

274
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,166
They just never let us be ourselves.

275
00:34:47,232 --> 00:34:49,208
Like that girl you killed?

276
00:34:50,081 --> 00:34:51,805
lf he finds out it was you...

277
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:53,782
This will be my pack one day.

278
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:57,568
My rules, my law.
So l will do what l want, when l want.

279
00:34:57,634 --> 00:35:00,123
And your pretty mouth will stay shut.

280
00:35:01,347 --> 00:35:05,024
Now, run along, little Vivian.
The world must have its sweets.

281
00:35:11,045 --> 00:35:11,994
Lovely!

282
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,497
<i>-You did it again.
-That's the second time.</i>

283
00:35:13,573 --> 00:35:14,883
<i>You're too good at this.</i>

284
00:35:18,437 --> 00:35:20,161
You, we need to talk.

285
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:29,923
How are you, Gabriel? Business good?

286
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:33,728
<i>How's the bitch-du-jour
you left my mother for?</i>

287
00:35:35,945 --> 00:35:38,695
Have you and your friends
been hunting on your own?

288
00:35:39,113 --> 00:35:40,259
Never.

289
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:44,424
There are rumors. You were seen with her.

290
00:35:45,067 --> 00:35:47,783
<i>-Did Vivian say this?
-You didn't track her?</i>

291
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,657
-Well, not to hunt. lt was a game.
-A game?

292
00:35:53,932 --> 00:35:55,721
Rafe, you are my son.

293
00:35:56,749 --> 00:35:59,269
<i>But if it's true, l can't protect you.</i>

294
00:35:59,502 --> 00:36:01,803
<i>-l won't.
-Vivian's a liar.</i>

295
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:05,613
This has nothing to do with her.
Did you hunt that girl or not?

296
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:10,057
<i>l didn't touch a hair on her pretty head.</i>

297
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:24,774
lf man suspects we are still here,

298
00:36:25,522 --> 00:36:27,660
he will exterminate us.

299
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:30,119
-We must rule this city from the shadows.
-Because we fear them.

300
00:36:30,194 --> 00:36:32,082
We are millions no more.

301
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:36,562
Please, hear my warning.

302
00:36:40,724 --> 00:36:43,442
Because the day
you hunt outside your pack,

303
00:36:44,693 --> 00:36:46,352
you are dead to it.

304
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:28,471
l got it. l got it.

305
00:37:53,826 --> 00:37:56,892
<i>How's an American girl
end up in Romania anyhow?</i>

306
00:37:56,961 --> 00:37:58,521
l was born here

307
00:37:58,593 --> 00:38:02,043
in a community of expatriates from all over.

308
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:05,436
And my parents moved to the States
when l was little,

309
00:38:05,507 --> 00:38:07,417
and then l moved back.

310
00:38:07,492 --> 00:38:09,182
Without your parents?

311
00:38:09,828 --> 00:38:12,316
They died in the States when l was little.

312
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,322
<i>l've lived with my aunt ever since.</i>

313
00:38:16,229 --> 00:38:19,296
-Do you remember them?
-Every day.

314
00:38:20,902 --> 00:38:24,864
My aunt says that they
used to take me to that church all the time.

315
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:30,850
<i>Do you always act
like you're being watched?</i>

316
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,954
<i>You're not allowed to take a walk
with a handsome starving artist?</i>

317
00:38:34,024 --> 00:38:37,058
Who only puts his initials on his books.

318
00:38:37,385 --> 00:38:39,426
<i>What's he hiding from?</i>

319
00:38:39,498 --> 00:38:41,505
Well, l could tell you,
but l would have to kill you.

320
00:38:42,986 --> 00:38:46,663
<i>So, how's your book coming?
l mean, what's the city taught you?</i>

321
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:49,317
That the werewolf stories
have got it all wrong.

322
00:38:49,387 --> 00:38:53,065
<i>ln the Ioup-garou legend,
they're not cursed, they're blessed.</i>

323
00:38:53,484 --> 00:38:57,314
<i>Like the moon turning them into wolves.
That's all how it was twisted later.</i>

324
00:38:57,644 --> 00:38:59,303
<i>The Ioup-garous
can change whenever they want.</i>

325
00:38:59,372 --> 00:39:02,472
<i>lt's mind over matter. Transcendence.</i>

326
00:39:03,245 --> 00:39:06,988
You know, they believe they will change,
and in that moment they do.

327
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,574
Can you imagine that?
From a man to a wolf.

328
00:39:10,383 --> 00:39:13,384
-lt sounds beautiful.
-lt is.

329
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:17,415
Supposedly, you could kill them with silver

330
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,627
but also with fire.

331
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:21,095
Really?

332
00:39:21,168 --> 00:39:24,038
<i>And you couldn't become one.
You know, be bitten or whatever.</i>

333
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:26,797
<i>You're either born a Ioup-garou
or you're not.</i>

334
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:31,595
<i>And in the stories they say that
if you harm a Ioup-garou,</i>

335
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:35,627
if they bleed, that they show you just
a glimpse of what they really are.

336
00:39:35,923 --> 00:39:38,225
<i>lt's all in the eyes, apparently.</i>

337
00:39:48,629 --> 00:39:51,826
<i>Oh, no, what, this place is closed?
l can't believe it.</i>

338
00:39:51,893 --> 00:39:56,117
They have this fantastic cafê on the roof.
Got the best views of the whole city.

339
00:39:56,247 --> 00:39:57,937
Not the whole city.

340
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:02,004
How about l take you somewhere?

341
00:40:06,712 --> 00:40:09,430
Vivian! This is private property.

342
00:40:12,217 --> 00:40:14,160
Never stopped you before.

343
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,952
l have a great feeling about this.

344
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:50,076
One of the richest men in the city lives here.

345
00:40:50,145 --> 00:40:51,192
<i>He's an art collector.</i>

346
00:40:51,264 --> 00:40:54,166
This is so much better than the date
l had planned.

347
00:40:56,673 --> 00:40:59,805
When l say run, run.

348
00:41:07,108 --> 00:41:10,686
-You never said run.
-Run.

349
00:41:18,661 --> 00:41:22,044
Now, this is the best view of the whole city.

350
00:41:29,608 --> 00:41:32,642
<i>They're all that's left of Bucharest castle.</i>

351
00:41:33,288 --> 00:41:36,322
Built by the Magyar princes
in the 10th century.

352
00:41:36,392 --> 00:41:39,294
<i>lt was said that the princes' bloodline
was Ioup-garou.</i>

353
00:41:39,368 --> 00:41:43,876
<i>So when the Magyars lost the throne,
it was said that the wolves' reign was over.</i>

354
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:47,303
<i>How'd you know they were here?</i>

355
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:49,987
<i>l thought you'd like to see them.</i>

356
00:41:50,731 --> 00:41:53,153
<i>You're full of secrets, aren't you?</i>

357
00:41:53,516 --> 00:41:56,582
<i>Don't you want to draw them or something?</i>

358
00:41:57,388 --> 00:42:01,218
<i>Whenever l'm with you
l get the feeling you're hiding.</i>

359
00:42:04,141 --> 00:42:07,851
My family has plans for me.

360
00:42:08,845 --> 00:42:12,938
<i>Expectations. Where l go, who l'm with.</i>

361
00:42:15,023 --> 00:42:17,892
<i>But your future is your own, isn't it?</i>

362
00:42:27,025 --> 00:42:29,513
Let me tell you something.

363
00:42:33,138 --> 00:42:37,295
My old man was an ex-Army Ranger
and an addict.

364
00:42:37,363 --> 00:42:42,317
And he told me that l was gonna learn
to defend myself whether l wanted to or not.

365
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:47,403
<i>Truth is, all l really wanted to do was draw,
but that wasn't exactly on the agenda.</i>

366
00:42:47,637 --> 00:42:53,040
So one day we had it out, you know.

367
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:56,459
l was 1 7, said l was leaving, the whole thing.

368
00:42:56,566 --> 00:43:00,877
And he said he would kill me if l tried.

369
00:43:02,423 --> 00:43:04,693
And l tried.

370
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:07,956
What happened?

371
00:43:09,657 --> 00:43:13,913
Turns out l knew how to defend myself
better than l thought.

372
00:43:14,938 --> 00:43:18,353
Which is why my name is not on my books.

373
00:43:19,162 --> 00:43:21,432
<i>lf he finds me, he'll follow through.</i>

374
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:24,794
<i>There's an assault warrant out on me
in the States.</i>

375
00:43:25,403 --> 00:43:29,495
So now l write from wherever l travel,
send it in to my publisher.

376
00:43:30,396 --> 00:43:32,502
Since you were 1 7?

377
00:43:32,733 --> 00:43:35,035
But my point is,

378
00:43:35,773 --> 00:43:39,636
l know what it feels like not to want
what they want for you.

379
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:44,886
<i>But it's your life. You don't get another.</i>

380
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:50,937
<i>And in any other, l wouldn't be here.</i>

381
00:44:20,454 --> 00:44:22,787
So am l going to see you again?

382
00:44:22,981 --> 00:44:24,575
-No.
-Never?

383
00:44:24,646 --> 00:44:29,404
-Ever.
-So l guess this is goodbye then.

384
00:44:43,658 --> 00:44:47,236
<i>Your family don't have to know.
lf that's the way you want it.</i>

385
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:52,772
<i>lt's the way you should want it, too.</i>

386
00:46:02,743 --> 00:46:05,427
<i>So what's your train ticket say?</i>

387
00:46:05,495 --> 00:46:07,437
<i>l'm mean, what's the date on it?</i>

388
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:12,117
<i>l tore it up. l'm inspired now.
l'm starting over with the book.</i>

389
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:14,223
All over?

390
00:46:14,297 --> 00:46:18,160
<i>lt's going to be about the Magyar princes
and Bucharest castle.</i>

391
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:20,917
<i>Back in the Ioup-garou glory days,
when they ran the city.</i>

392
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:23,382
And their rise and fall.

393
00:46:23,451 --> 00:46:25,305
Why do they have to fall?

394
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:27,313
What? People who can turn themselves
into animals?

395
00:46:27,387 --> 00:46:29,657
How could we not be threatened by that?

396
00:46:30,524 --> 00:46:33,557
<i>Hey, if you don't want me to let them fall...</i>

397
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,438
<i>-Hey, what's the matter?
-Nothing, l cut myself.</i>

398
00:46:53,503 --> 00:46:57,531
-You did? Let me see.
-No! l have to get home.

399
00:46:57,601 --> 00:47:00,863
<i>-You don't have to go home.
-Yes, she does.</i>

400
00:47:01,793 --> 00:47:03,419
Caution with my cousin, meat.

401
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:06,458
Many men have courted her,
none have survived to tell the tale.

402
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:07,774
Leave him alone, Rafe.

403
00:47:07,842 --> 00:47:10,232
<i>Some girls will steal your heart,
this bitch'll eat it.</i>

404
00:47:10,307 --> 00:47:11,769
Take your hands off her.

405
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:13,730
<i>What? Didn't she tell you?</i>

406
00:47:13,795 --> 00:47:16,065
<i>She's promised to someone. A man.
An important man.</i>

407
00:47:16,132 --> 00:47:17,081
Leave him alone!

408
00:47:17,156 --> 00:47:19,327
The man who brought her home
after she got her parents killed.

409
00:47:19,396 --> 00:47:20,607
She told you that, right?

410
00:47:20,677 --> 00:47:23,133
That they were slaughtered
and it was her fault?

411
00:47:23,302 --> 00:47:24,763
<i>What's he talking about?</i>

412
00:47:24,837 --> 00:47:28,831
<i>She's taken, friend. She owes a man.</i>

413
00:47:29,606 --> 00:47:31,614
<i>She's not for you.</i>

414
00:47:35,495 --> 00:47:38,910
<i>He's a rare find, isn't he? Medium rare.</i>

415
00:47:38,983 --> 00:47:41,122
Go to hell.

416
00:47:41,256 --> 00:47:43,907
Yes, l probably will.

417
00:47:50,057 --> 00:47:52,033
<i>What's he talking about, ''taken''?</i>

418
00:47:52,107 --> 00:47:54,278
<i>We can't meet again.</i>

419
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:59,044
We can do whatever we want.
What the hell is wrong, Vivian?

420
00:47:59,115 --> 00:48:00,938
l told you about my family from the start.

421
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:04,420
The hell with your family, right?
What, do they own you?

422
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,237
Are you gonna let them own you?

423
00:48:06,304 --> 00:48:09,087
<i>l won't let you be my fault.</i>

424
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:21,758
They talk of secrets, our secrets.

425
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:24,476
These four heard her themselves.

426
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:27,545
ls she protecting the pack?

427
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,205
Who is he?

428
00:48:30,276 --> 00:48:31,837
<i>He's meat.</i>

429
00:48:32,324 --> 00:48:34,332
American brand.

430
00:48:35,652 --> 00:48:39,068
<i>She talks to him of Ioup-garous, Gabriel.</i>

431
00:48:42,406 --> 00:48:44,446
Or is Vivian above our law?

432
00:48:46,822 --> 00:48:48,764
She has grown feelings for him?

433
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,847
Then you will take care of that for me.

434
00:49:00,008 --> 00:49:01,983
-Me?
-Yes.

435
00:49:02,057 --> 00:49:03,999
<i>l'm sure you'll know what to do.</i>

436
00:49:04,073 --> 00:49:06,440
Bribe him, threaten him. Whatever it takes.

437
00:49:06,506 --> 00:49:09,124
He spends not one more night in this city.

438
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,846
He stays, he dies.

439
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:03,985
<i>''Forgive me.
I've so much to say and so IittIe time.</i>

440
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:09,195
<i>''Meet me at SiIestru ChapeI
north of the city tonight at 6.:*00.</i>

441
00:50:10,355 --> 00:50:12,111
<i>''Vivian. ''</i>

442
00:51:01,532 --> 00:51:04,020
How is this for a resting place?

443
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,075
lt was built in the 13th century,

444
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:12,281
supposedly on soil brought
from the Holy Land.

445
00:51:12,413 --> 00:51:16,123
So many people wanted to be buried here
that the cemetery overflowed.

446
00:51:16,189 --> 00:51:17,913
So they improvised.

447
00:51:17,982 --> 00:51:19,324
<i>Where's Vivian?</i>

448
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:23,547
<i>l like to think they're saying,
''Come on, it's not so bad.''</i>

449
00:51:23,903 --> 00:51:26,424
<i>l asked where's Vivian.</i>

450
00:51:26,496 --> 00:51:28,406
Not with you.

451
00:51:30,336 --> 00:51:34,428
<i>Little Vivian, she's like a wounded animal,
you see:*</i>

452
00:51:34,496 --> 00:51:36,406
<i>She's had her heart broken
one too many times.</i>

453
00:51:36,481 --> 00:51:38,586
<i>You're here to protect her?</i>

454
00:51:38,689 --> 00:51:43,512
<i>Merely from herself. So, when's your train?</i>

455
00:51:45,154 --> 00:51:49,345
<i>-What if l'm not on it?
-Then what's left of you will be.</i>

456
00:51:50,435 --> 00:51:53,153
<i>Unless, of course,
you'd rather be buried here, you know.</i>

457
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:56,537
-As a ceiling fan or something.
-Why am l such a threat?

458
00:51:56,612 --> 00:51:57,627
<i>She's a fragile girl.</i>

459
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:00,384
No, no, why am l such a threat to you?

460
00:52:03,301 --> 00:52:07,262
<i>Oh, no, my friend. You're not a threat.</i>

461
00:52:07,558 --> 00:52:09,663
This is a threat.

462
00:52:09,766 --> 00:52:11,806
<i>You'll leave Romania on the next train.</i>

463
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:15,140
<i>You won't write to her, talk to her,
or come looking for her ever again.</i>

464
00:52:15,207 --> 00:52:17,891
Because if you so much as breathe
her name...

465
00:52:23,241 --> 00:52:25,313
Do you hear me breathing?

466
00:52:28,617 --> 00:52:31,749
<i>Yes, look! Look what you've done!</i>

467
00:52:32,457 --> 00:52:36,681
You stupid meat, l was here to save you,
to warn you.

468
00:52:36,906 --> 00:52:40,168
<i>But now, now you're mine.</i>

469
00:52:50,765 --> 00:52:53,515
Bless this food for our use
and us to thy service.

470
00:53:13,584 --> 00:53:17,676
<i>l'll take the train, l swear it.
l'm gone. l'm on that train.</i>

471
00:53:17,745 --> 00:53:20,134
l am the train.

472
00:54:25,243 --> 00:54:28,145
<i>Oh, my God, it's silver.</i>

473
00:55:51,337 --> 00:55:55,975
<i>So your playmate's home tonight.
You should come see me.</i>

474
00:55:56,042 --> 00:55:57,897
Not tonight, Astrid.

475
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,323
These old laws, you can change them.

476
00:56:00,394 --> 00:56:03,623
Seven years, why seven?
Real wolves mate for life.

477
00:56:03,882 --> 00:56:05,825
Not another word.

478
00:56:07,691 --> 00:56:11,620
Come on. We used to set this place on fire.

479
00:56:14,189 --> 00:56:18,827
We all grow old, Astrid.
We have to do it with dignity.

480
00:56:44,658 --> 00:56:47,113
Aiden? What...

481
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:51,408
Aiden, what happened?

482
00:56:51,506 --> 00:56:52,684
Your cousin.

483
00:56:52,787 --> 00:56:55,635
-Rafe? What are you...
-Stay back.

484
00:56:56,723 --> 00:56:59,090
Why do you know so much about wolves,
Vivian?

485
00:56:59,156 --> 00:57:01,261
What are you talking about?
How badly are you hurt?

486
00:57:01,332 --> 00:57:04,267
<i>ls it 'cause you knew he was one, huh?</i>

487
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:08,235
<i>Loup-garou. Like the legend.
Like a comic book.</i>

488
00:57:10,165 --> 00:57:11,988
Where is he?

489
00:57:12,886 --> 00:57:14,380
Extinct.

490
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,913
Take it.

491
00:57:28,664 --> 00:57:31,698
<i>Go on, take it. lt's silver.</i>

492
00:57:35,641 --> 00:57:39,832
-l wanted to protect you.
-Protect me from who? From you?

493
00:57:40,314 --> 00:57:41,841
<i>You're not possible.</i>

494
00:57:41,915 --> 00:57:44,817
Get out of town. Get out of Romania.
Get out and never come back.

495
00:57:44,891 --> 00:57:46,385
<i>lf they find you, they'll kill you.</i>

496
00:57:46,459 --> 00:57:47,604
<i>Oh, it's ''they'' now, huh?</i>

497
00:57:47,675 --> 00:57:49,334
What did you want from me, the truth?

498
00:57:49,403 --> 00:57:51,770
Listen, my life is over. l just killed someone!

499
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:55,665
<i>They're gonna find my prints, my blood.
What am l gonna tell them?</i>

500
00:57:56,188 --> 00:57:58,610
What will you tell them?

501
00:57:58,685 --> 00:58:02,482
<i>lt's just too much to ask, l guess,
just a human girl.</i>

502
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:05,141
<i>-Aiden, l never wanted...
-lt's too late for that.</i>

503
00:58:06,142 --> 00:58:11,031
<i>lf you cared a goddamn thing about me,
you would've left me before we ever met.</i>

504
00:58:20,512 --> 00:58:22,301
Aiden.

505
00:59:21,833 --> 00:59:24,005
May l help you, sir?

506
00:59:26,219 --> 00:59:29,383
Yes, as a matter of fact you can.

507
00:59:31,339 --> 00:59:33,674
Are these real silver?

508
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:35,559
Of course.

509
00:59:35,628 --> 00:59:37,351
Thank you.

510
00:59:52,558 --> 00:59:54,860
We went to find him.

511
00:59:58,608 --> 01:00:01,358
<i>He'd been gone for so long.</i>

512
01:00:33,781 --> 01:00:36,083
What is it, Vivian?

513
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:39,281
<i>His car's outside.</i>

514
01:00:58,648 --> 01:01:00,274
<i>What's happened?</i>

515
01:01:02,361 --> 01:01:04,085
Our son is dead.

516
01:01:21,756 --> 01:01:24,277
He will be avenged.

517
01:01:45,696 --> 01:01:47,256
Do you need some help?

518
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:50,842
<i>No. No, thank you, Officers.
l'm just waiting for my train.</i>

519
01:01:51,137 --> 01:01:53,047
The correct answer is yes.

520
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:29,567
My lords and ladies.

521
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:35,236
Man has forced us to hide our true nature.

522
01:02:35,368 --> 01:02:38,020
He has persecuted us for centuries.

523
01:02:40,297 --> 01:02:43,297
Last night, he took yet another life.

524
01:02:46,954 --> 01:02:49,093
The life of my son.

525
01:02:52,427 --> 01:02:57,032
But we will have vengeance,
for his murderer is here.

526
01:03:02,636 --> 01:03:04,546
No!

527
01:03:04,973 --> 01:03:05,922
Him!

528
01:03:05,996 --> 01:03:06,979
Rafe went to kill him.

529
01:03:07,053 --> 01:03:11,178
This man knew our secret
because one of us let him get too near.

530
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:13,254
And how would you know that?

531
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:17,289
Did Rafe hunt him down on his own,
or did you send him?

532
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:19,148
He killed my son.
He must pay with his blood.

533
01:03:19,215 --> 01:03:21,452
You sent your own son to his death
over me?

534
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:23,658
Enough!

535
01:03:27,921 --> 01:03:31,216
lf he lives,
he will bring the hunters in the night.

536
01:03:31,473 --> 01:03:35,816
Just like the ones who killed your parents.
And it will be all your fault again.

537
01:03:43,442 --> 01:03:45,712
<i>There's a river within those woods.</i>

538
01:03:45,779 --> 01:03:48,681
lf you reach the other side,
you win your life.

539
01:03:50,004 --> 01:03:51,379
No.

540
01:03:53,748 --> 01:03:55,504
Wish your enemy well.

541
01:04:00,341 --> 01:04:02,164
Wish him well.

542
01:04:29,914 --> 01:04:31,540
Run.

543
01:05:20,866 --> 01:05:24,096
You say man is a heartless killer.
How are we any different?

544
01:05:24,226 --> 01:05:26,267
We only kill to survive.

545
01:05:27,235 --> 01:05:29,243
Take her to the car till l come back.

546
01:05:48,103 --> 01:05:50,372
<i>Stupid girl. You are Ioup-garou.</i>

547
01:07:45,048 --> 01:07:48,016
Creeks lead to rivers.

548
01:09:42,699 --> 01:09:44,521
But l crossed the river.

549
01:09:45,004 --> 01:09:46,465
The river.

550
01:10:27,826 --> 01:10:30,444
What about your goddamn river, huh?

551
01:10:58,839 --> 01:11:01,589
Oh, Jesus, no.

552
01:11:10,328 --> 01:11:12,565
<i>l'm sorry, l...</i>

553
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:36,726
<i>Please don't kill me.</i>

554
01:11:52,223 --> 01:11:57,526
<i>Hold on, there's a road ahead.
We have to get you to a hospital.</i>

555
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,663
No, hospitals only make it worse.

556
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:02,716
Then where?

557
01:12:04,481 --> 01:12:06,304
<i>There's a place.</i>

558
01:12:50,569 --> 01:12:53,864
Vivian! You home, little girl?

559
01:12:58,602 --> 01:13:02,465
<i>They won't look for us here.
This is a film company.</i>

560
01:13:02,699 --> 01:13:05,481
Do you know what makes
photographs work?

561
01:13:05,611 --> 01:13:07,498
Silver.

562
01:13:10,059 --> 01:13:14,762
<i>They say, even now,
it'll kill you to breathe it.</i>

563
01:13:15,084 --> 01:13:16,426
Will it?

564
01:13:16,493 --> 01:13:19,177
<i>lt's already in my bloodstream.</i>

565
01:13:19,629 --> 01:13:23,623
<i>Once it's in, it stays in, unless it's treated.</i>

566
01:13:24,558 --> 01:13:25,965
Treated how?

567
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:30,024
<i>There's an anti-serum for silver
called Antigen-AG.</i>

568
01:13:30,895 --> 01:13:33,317
l know where l can find some
but not until dark.

569
01:13:35,344 --> 01:13:36,871
Come on.

570
01:13:41,936 --> 01:13:43,759
Vivian!

571
01:13:58,290 --> 01:13:59,981
<i>You didn't leave.</i>

572
01:14:01,427 --> 01:14:03,816
<i>l'm running out of people to trust.</i>

573
01:14:04,628 --> 01:14:06,897
<i>l've never killed anyone.</i>

574
01:14:07,444 --> 01:14:10,444
At the hunts. Please believe me.

575
01:14:10,676 --> 01:14:13,459
Why do you even go?

576
01:14:15,285 --> 01:14:19,661
<i>lt's not the hunt l live for. lt's the running.</i>

577
01:14:20,598 --> 01:14:23,152
The being free.

578
01:14:24,887 --> 01:14:28,400
They were my tracks the hunters followed
back to our house.

579
01:14:30,488 --> 01:14:32,113
<i>That doesn't make it your fault.</i>

580
01:14:32,184 --> 01:14:34,486
Men kill us. We kill men.

581
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:38,961
<i>Because anything we're not
is a thing we're taught to fear.</i>

582
01:15:07,742 --> 01:15:12,663
<i>So is that fear you're feeling right now?
Or is that something else?</i>

583
01:15:15,647 --> 01:15:17,655
<i>lt's fear.</i>

584
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,117
<i>Of what you'll do?</i>

585
01:15:25,793 --> 01:15:27,964
Of what you think of me.

586
01:15:45,924 --> 01:15:49,634
<i>When l draw you, Ioup-garou,</i>

587
01:15:50,821 --> 01:15:53,025
<i>l'd wish that you were real.</i>

588
01:15:54,853 --> 01:15:58,716
So what right do l have
to wish you away now?

589
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:05,919
You can control it.

590
01:16:06,759 --> 01:16:08,482
l can control it.

591
01:16:37,196 --> 01:16:40,230
Where would she hide, l asked.

592
01:16:40,301 --> 01:16:42,308
Where else but where l told her not to?

593
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:45,676
<i>-Don't, Astrid.
-He's not one of us.</i>

594
01:16:47,566 --> 01:16:50,828
<i>Astrid, don't. There is another way.</i>

595
01:16:50,958 --> 01:16:56,458
lt was man who killed my sister.
lt was man who killed my son.

596
01:16:56,655 --> 01:16:59,208
lt was Gabriel that killed Rafe.

597
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:04,015
<i>Just like he'll kill me.
lt's the only justice he knows.</i>

598
01:17:04,496 --> 01:17:07,758
<i>l'll protect you. l'll make him see.</i>

599
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:11,501
<i>Just like you'll make him see
who he really belongs with?</i>

600
01:17:11,761 --> 01:17:15,242
Your first love all went wrong.

601
01:17:15,537 --> 01:17:18,407
<i>Please don't take mine from me.</i>

602
01:17:26,963 --> 01:17:29,517
ls that silver?

603
01:17:30,388 --> 01:17:32,690
<i>We're going to the pharmacist's.
We're getting antigen,</i>

604
01:17:32,756 --> 01:17:34,698
<i>and then we're leaving the city.</i>

605
01:17:36,725 --> 01:17:40,468
<i>He can't love you if he fears you.</i>

606
01:17:43,062 --> 01:17:45,878
Tell me not to fall in love, Astrid.

607
01:17:46,614 --> 01:17:49,648
Tell me how much more to life there is.

608
01:17:54,456 --> 01:17:59,159
Run, my little girl. Run free.

609
01:18:07,258 --> 01:18:08,949
Prescription.

610
01:18:15,131 --> 01:18:18,994
Hands on the counter.
Gabriel owns this guy.

611
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:25,884
You must be in some kind hairy situation?

612
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:35,924
Got some splinter in your paw?

613
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:42,328
Like lemonade on a hot day.

614
01:18:59,746 --> 01:19:02,299
Stop! Drop the gun.

615
01:19:03,395 --> 01:19:07,257
Sorry, my furry friend. Drop the gun.

616
01:19:42,857 --> 01:19:44,384
Watch out!

617
01:19:50,698 --> 01:19:51,811
Run!

618
01:19:58,987 --> 01:20:02,283
How many of us have to die
for your happiness?

619
01:20:02,988 --> 01:20:04,931
l can smell him on you.

620
01:20:48,723 --> 01:20:52,401
You try to run a simple business...

621
01:20:55,604 --> 01:20:58,222
My new best customer.

622
01:20:58,421 --> 01:21:02,350
l want your antigen,
your bullets and your dust.

623
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,728
How does it feel to be in a cage

624
01:21:28,825 --> 01:21:31,095
the way man would have you?

625
01:21:32,474 --> 01:21:35,508
You could have been
a great inspiration to your people.

626
01:21:36,698 --> 01:21:40,594
But look at you now. Our greatest shame.

627
01:21:44,604 --> 01:21:47,507
When you put your trust in man,
you condemn us all.

628
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:49,042
We condemn ourselves.

629
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:05,492
<i>Aren't we half-human?</i>

630
01:22:05,567 --> 01:22:08,731
<i>Don't you see that what you denounce
is a part of you?</i>

631
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,520
<i>lt's not part of me. lt's part of you.</i>

632
01:22:14,592 --> 01:22:16,698
l know what l am.

633
01:22:20,001 --> 01:22:23,417
You and your traditions can go to hell.

634
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:27,832
Well, you are the future of this pack.

635
01:22:28,515 --> 01:22:30,752
<i>l'll let you name her fate.</i>

636
01:22:51,174 --> 01:22:53,924
What have you ever loved, Gabriel?

637
01:22:54,023 --> 01:22:58,530
<i>Power, hate, fear?
You're the most human of us all.</i>

638
01:22:58,823 --> 01:23:00,133
You never understood.

639
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,622
The ancient prophecy said a girl
from the bloodline of leaders

640
01:23:02,696 --> 01:23:04,354
would one day command us

641
01:23:04,424 --> 01:23:07,043
and lead us into a new age
of hope and glory.

642
01:23:07,561 --> 01:23:09,601
l thought that girl was you.

643
01:23:09,673 --> 01:23:12,390
And what will the new age of hope
look like?

644
01:23:12,457 --> 01:23:14,312
How much blood will there be?

645
01:23:14,378 --> 01:23:15,938
<i>Let's find out tonight.</i>

646
01:23:16,042 --> 01:23:18,792
We hunt, you and l.

647
01:23:32,301 --> 01:23:34,603
<i>Quick, he's there!</i>

648
01:24:59,771 --> 01:25:01,232
Drink up.

649
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:51,935
For you and all mankind.

650
01:25:59,011 --> 01:26:02,143
You want to shoot your own family?

651
01:26:05,253 --> 01:26:08,734
You want to be that hunter
on that snowy night?

652
01:26:10,789 --> 01:26:13,473
Then l give you my back.

653
01:26:13,862 --> 01:26:16,383
<i>That's all you deserve.</i>

654
01:26:31,529 --> 01:26:33,023
Shoot him.

655
01:26:34,569 --> 01:26:36,064
<i>l can't.</i>

656
01:26:38,154 --> 01:26:39,780
Shoot him.

657
01:26:42,667 --> 01:26:44,227
<i>l can't.</i>

658
01:27:27,697 --> 01:27:31,080
Hey, Vivian! Vivian, help.

659
01:27:37,299 --> 01:27:40,234
May you know the age of hope
when you see it.

660
01:28:01,623 --> 01:28:06,163
<i>So how are we going to get out of the city
if they're watching everywhere?</i>

661
01:28:07,704 --> 01:28:09,777
<i>There's one place they won't be.</i>

662
01:28:30,715 --> 01:28:35,255
<i>This is my worId. These are my peopIe.</i>

663
01:28:37,469 --> 01:28:41,048
<i>They beIieve in prophecies and destinies.</i>

664
01:28:41,661 --> 01:28:43,701
<i>I beIieve we make our own.</i>

665
01:28:47,742 --> 01:28:49,530
Where are we headed?

666
01:28:50,015 --> 01:28:51,957
How about the age of hope?

667
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,586
Either that or Paris.
