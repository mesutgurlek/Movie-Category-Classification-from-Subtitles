have to do better than a wrench.

He's just a kid!

We reconvene at sunset,
then what happens, happens.

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:17,465
Isn't there anybody else
who's gonna stand with me?

6
00:00:17,593 --> 00:00:20,021
- This is a young man's life!
- Do it.

7
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:22,274
Take him away.

8
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,388
Do something!

9
00:00:27,838 --> 00:00:28,795
Sorry, brother.

10
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,564
Rick's voice: <i>Dale could--
could get under your skin.</i>

11
00:00:49,234 --> 00:00:53,570
<i>He sure got under mine,</i>

12
00:00:53,572 --> 00:00:56,473
because he wasn't afraid <i>to
say exactly what he thought,</i>

13
00:00:57,676 --> 00:00:59,710
<i>how he felt.</i>

14
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:05,916
That kind of honesty is rare

15
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,321
and brave.

16
00:01:13,858 --> 00:01:16,094
<i>Whenever I'd make a decision,</i>

17
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:21,001
<i>I'd look at Dale.</i>

18
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:25,941
He'd be looking back at me
with that look he had.

19
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:30,914
<i>We've all seen it</i>
<i>one time or another.</i>

20
00:01:35,253 --> 00:01:38,856

<i>but he could read us.</i>

Rick: <i>He saw people
for who they were.</i>

23
00:01:45,697 --> 00:01:47,631
He knew things about us--

24
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,534
<i>The truth...</i>

25
00:01:52,103 --> 00:01:55,372
<i>Who we really are.</i>

26
00:01:55,374 --> 00:01:58,844
In the end, he was talking
about losing our humanity.

27

<i>( Walkers growling )</i>

28
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:03,015
<i>He said this group was broken.</i>

29
00:02:07,121 --> 00:02:09,623
The best way to honor him
<i>is to unbreak it.</i>

30
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:13,261
Set aside our differences
and pull together,

31
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:16,365
st feeling sorry for ourselves

32
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:20,303
<i>and take control</i>

<i>...our future.</i>

35
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,878
We're not broken.

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,214
We're gonna prove him wrong.

37
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:39,861
<i>From now on...</i>

38
00:02:39,863 --> 00:02:42,197
<i>We're gonna do it his way.</i>

39
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:45,801
That is how we honor Dale.

Hershel:
Don't worry about that.

With the swamp hardening,
the creek drying up...

47
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,082
With 50 head of cattle
on the property,

48
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:04,350
we might as well be ringing
a damn dinner bell.

49
00:04:04,352 --> 00:04:05,719
She's right.

50
00:04:05,721 --> 00:04:09,322
We should've moved you
in a while ago.

51
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:12,325
All right, let's move the
vehicles near each of the doors

52
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:13,960
- facing out toward the road.
- Just leave it there.

53

Rick: <i>We'll build a
lookout in the windmill,</i>

54
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,131
another in the barn loft.
That should give us sightlines

55
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,232
both sides of the property.

56
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:22,434
T-Dog, you take the perimeter
around the house.

57
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,036
Keep track of everyone
coming and going.

58
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:25,437
What about standing guard?

59
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,440
I need you and Daryl
on double duty.

60
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:30,342
Gotcha.

61
00:04:30,344 --> 00:04:32,811
I'll stock the basement
with food and water,

62
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:36,148
enough that we can all survive
there a few days if need be.

63
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,851
- What about patrols?
- Let's get this area locked down first.

64
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:40,820
After that,
Shane'll assign shifts

65
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,257
while me and Daryl take Randall
offsite and cut him loose.

66
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,461
We're back to that now?

67
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:51,130
It was the right plan
first time around.

68
00:04:51,132 --> 00:04:53,133
Poor execution.

69

slight understatement

you don't agree, but this
what's happening.

71

Swallow it--
Move on.

72
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,442
You know that Dale's death
and the prisoner--

73
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:04,011
that's two separate
things, right?

74
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,115
You wanna take Daryl
as your wingman,

75
00:05:08,117 --> 00:05:10,751
be my guest.

76

not taking Shane with you.

Just know I've got
no more patience

80
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,950
where he's concerned.

81
00:05:42,952 --> 00:05:45,186
He's turning over a new leaf.

Andrea.

83
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:52,793
When I'm out with Daryl,

84
00:05:52,795 --> 00:05:55,496
help Hershel keep an eye
on things around here.

85
00:05:55,498 --> 00:05:58,432
- Me
- Shane's got a way

86
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:00,167
of letting things
get out of hand,

87
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,903
especially when
he's all torqued up.

88
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:05,573
I think we're all a bit
torqued up at this point.

89
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:08,676
If you're staying here permanently,
he's got to understand

90
00:06:08,678 --> 00:06:12,180
that it's what Rick and I
say, not whatever he wants.

91
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:15,316
- You've become close.
- We talk.

92
00:06:15,318 --> 00:06:17,218
Then you know
he's not a bad guy.

93
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,386
He's just his own worst enemy.

94
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:21,622
You want me to babysit Shane?

95
00:06:21,624 --> 00:06:24,491
( Sighs ) I need to make sure
every time I leave the farm

all hell doesn't break loose.

97
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:28,662
Then maybe
you should stop leaving.

98
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,533

- Of course.

What you doing, wandering
around by yourself?

102
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:53,551
If, um--
If I tell you something,

103
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:56,388
will you promise
not to tell my parents?

104
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,392
I think it's probably a bad
idea for both of us, bud.

And it-- it got free,
came after me and...

Okay, I wasn't supposed
to say anything,

and he came across a walker
stuck in the mud.

He got scared, ran off.

- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

Hey-hey, keep it quiet

323
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,872
now your group--
you know where they're at?

324
00:24:20,874 --> 00:24:23,240
- No, I don't. I really-- oh!
- Okay.

325
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:25,442
Get your little ass up here.
Now I'm the only shot

326
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:27,877
of you getting out of these woods alive.
You hear me?

327

Now you start talking, boy.
Where are they at?

328
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,051
We had a camp
set up off the highway...

329
00:24:34,053 --> 00:24:35,486
- Okay.
- ...About five miles from here.

330
00:24:35,488 --> 00:24:37,421
- Shh-- Okay.
- Who knows if they're still there?

331
00:24:37,423 --> 00:24:41,925
Okay. So you gonna
take me to 'em?

332
00:24:43,361 --> 00:24:45,196
Why?

333
00:24:45,198 --> 00:24:47,231
Because, man, I--
I'm just--

334
00:24:47,233 --> 00:24:49,233
I'm done with this group, man.

335
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:50,935
They doomed and I want
no part of it.

336
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:55,273
- That's all.
- So you're not gonna kill me?

337
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:59,144
Come on, man. If I was,
you'd be dead. Come on.

Hey, you ain't

- Carol: <i>Just let him go.</i>

That was the plan, wasn't it,
to just let him go?

372
00:27:19,285 --> 00:27:20,985
The plan was to cut him
loose far away from here,

373
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:22,687
not on our front step
with a gun.

- Okay.

378
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,536
I saw him head up through the trees
that way before I blacked out.

I'm not sure how long.

380
00:27:39,073 --> 00:27:40,840
He couldn't have gotten far.

381
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:42,474
He's hobbled, exhausted.

382
00:27:42,476 --> 00:27:44,376
- Glenn: And armed.
- Rick: So are we.

383
00:27:44,378 --> 00:27:47,746
- Can you track him?
- No, I don't see nothing.

384
00:27:47,748 --> 00:27:49,515
Hey, look, there ain't no
use in tracking him, okay?

385
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:51,083
He went that way.
We need to pair up.

386
00:27:51,085 --> 00:27:53,118
We spread out, we just
chase him down. That's it.

I say a rock pretty much
evens those odds, wouldn't you?

390
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:01,827
Alright, knock it off. You and Glenn
start heading up the right flank.

00:36:49,973 --> 00:36:53,141
<i>( Pants ) Come on, man.</i>
<i>Raise your gun.</i>

475
00:36:54,343 --> 00:36:57,244
- No. No, I will not.
- <i>What happened, Rick?</i>

476
00:36:57,246 --> 00:37:00,013
I thought you weren't the good guy
anymore. Ain't that what you said?

477
00:37:00,015 --> 00:37:02,516
Even right here, right now, you
ain't gonna fight for 'em?

478
00:37:02,518 --> 00:37:04,885
I'm a better father
than you, Rick.

479
00:37:04,887 --> 00:37:07,488
<i>I'm better for Lori</i>
<i>than you, man.</i>

480
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,557
It's 'cause I'm a better
man than you, Rick.

481
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:11,393
'Cause I can be here
and I'll fight for it.

482
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,730
You come back here and you
just destroy everything!

483
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:22,772
You got a broken woman.

484
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:25,441
You got a weak boy.

485
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,677
You ain't got the first clue
on how to fix it.

486
00:37:30,614 --> 00:37:32,414
Raise your gun.

487
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,982
You're gonna have
to kill an unarmed man.

488
00:37:40,088 --> 00:37:42,656
Watch my hand.

489
00:37:42,658 --> 00:37:44,925
Nice and easy.

490
00:37:54,936 --> 00:37:57,071
Easy does it.

491
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:05,746
Now listen to me, Shane.

492
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:10,351
There is still
a way back from this.

493
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:12,553
Nothing has happened here.

494
00:38:13,722 --> 00:38:15,824
We're gonna lay down our guns

495
00:38:17,493 --> 00:38:21,563
and we're gonna walk
back to the farm...

496
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,999
Together.

497
00:38:26,803 --> 00:38:29,172
Back to Lori.

498
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:31,607
Back to Carl.

499
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,350
Put this all behind us.

( Gurgling )

503
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:01,437
Damn you for making me
do this, Shane.

504
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:05,374
This was you, not me!
You did this to us!

505
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:08,511
This was you,
not me-- not me!

506
00:39:12,816 --> 00:39:15,385
Not me!

Carl: <i>Dad?</i>

Carl.

517
00:41:06,601 --> 00:41:09,703
You know...

518
00:41:09,705 --> 00:41:11,839
You should be
back home with mom.

519

( Gun clicks )

520
