Well, um...

764
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:53,941
After Lieutenant James Cook

765

Jesus! You are a smart cunt.

01:22:13,496 --> 01:22:17,298
I might have to let you
go on that answer alone.

772
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:21,535
Where'd you learn all that shit?

773
01:22:21,537 --> 01:22:26,640
Majoring in history? That's a
fucking coincidence, isn't it?

774
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:30,678
But I am a man of my word,

775
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,514
and either way, you
know, I did say 10...

776
01:22:33,516 --> 01:22:37,117
Blah, blah, blah. Here we go.

777
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:43,023
OK.

778
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:50,731
Rightio.

779
01:22:50,733 --> 01:22:54,468
In what year did the British

780
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:58,205
start deporting
convicts to Australia?

781
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:03,344
The first 11 ships of the First
Fleet arrived with their cargo

782
01:23:03,346 --> 01:23:08,349
of around 780 British convicts
in Botany Bay, New South Wales.

783
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:14,154
And a further two convict fleets
arrived in 1790 and 1791.

784
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:18,225
The first free settlers
arrived in 1793.

785
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:21,695
Mick?

786
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:24,732
Mick?

787
01:23:24,734 --> 01:23:26,600
That's right. Isn't it?

788
01:23:26,602 --> 01:23:28,302
I know it is.

789
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:32,306
Why?

790
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:41,315
I'm not really sure I
understand the question.

791
01:23:41,317 --> 01:23:47,588
Why did the British deport
convicts to Australia?

792
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:50,324
Why? Um...

793
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:54,328
Uh...

794
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:57,331
Come on, you dumb fuck!

795
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:59,133
Time waits for no man.

01:23:59,135 --> 01:24:01,235

(WHIRRING)

798
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:04,505
First... first... first of all,

799
01:24:04,507 --> 01:24:06,607
after the British lost
the 13 colonies -

800
01:24:06,609 --> 01:24:09,209
they'd lost their penal
settlements in Virginia

801
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:10,677
in the United States.

802
01:24:10,679 --> 01:24:13,280
And they needed somewhere
to put all the criminals

803
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:14,815
that were stacking up in England.

804
01:24:14,817 --> 01:24:17,117
There were just too
many of these people,

805
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:20,687
and they were just spreading
disease and wasting resources.

806
01:24:20,689 --> 01:24:22,790
- (WHIRRING)
- And, second of all, they...

807
01:24:22,792 --> 01:24:25,426
Australia looked to be
as rich in resources

808
01:24:25,428 --> 01:24:27,127
as the Americas.

809
01:24:27,129 --> 01:24:29,396
And obviously the British
wanted to settle this

810
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,765
before the French
did, or the Dutch.

811
01:24:31,767 --> 01:24:33,500
(COUGHS)

812
01:24:33,502 --> 01:24:35,269
Something like that?

813
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:39,139
Mick, no. What the fuck, man?
That's right!

814
01:24:39,141 --> 01:24:43,177
What are you doing? Mick! Fuck!
That's the right fucking answer!

815
