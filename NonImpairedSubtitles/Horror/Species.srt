1
00:04:56,354 --> 00:04:58,310
I'm sorry.

2
00:05:23,592 --> 00:05:25,901
Sir, she's breaking out!

3
00:05:55,032 --> 00:05:58,024
What are we looking for?

4
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:08,022
She's gone over the fence!

5
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:19,108
A couple of trains
came through here

6
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:21,831
around the time she escaped.

7
00:07:21,912 --> 00:07:25,063
Could she get this far
in that time?

8
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:28,861
- Is she that fast?
- She is that fast.

9
00:08:11,152 --> 00:08:13,427
- And this, too?
- 3.10.

10
00:08:13,512 --> 00:08:16,345
- $3.10?
- Right.

11
00:08:18,952 --> 00:08:21,182
- Here's your change.
- Thank you.

12
00:08:21,712 --> 00:08:23,828
Can I help you?

13
00:08:24,552 --> 00:08:27,350
The total's 17.95.

14
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:32,100
Here's your card.

15
00:08:33,432 --> 00:08:35,150
Are you buying those?

16
00:08:44,103 --> 00:08:46,333
Have a nice trip.

17
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:55,336
It's a brown tweed bag
with leather trim.

18
00:08:55,423 --> 00:08:58,859
Porter was going
to put it on the cart.

19
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:02,140
This is the cart,
but there's no bag.

20
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,052
This was the largest earthquake

21
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:26,896
to strike an urban area
in nearly 50...

22
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,453
He's riding Green Lightnin'.

23
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:35,137
Enjoy the view.

24
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:06,819
Excuse me.

25
00:10:21,023 --> 00:10:23,856
We shouldn't be seen together.

26
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:27,652
- Do you think Arlen suspects?
- No.

27
00:10:31,183 --> 00:10:33,014
Tickets, please.

28
00:10:35,103 --> 00:10:39,062
Are you travelling alone?
What, you're 12?

29
00:10:40,343 --> 00:10:44,541
Someone going to meet you
in Los Angeles?

30
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:49,060
We'll say you're 11.
You only pay half-price.

31
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:57,866
Can't believe
our little girl did this.

32
00:10:57,952 --> 00:11:00,182
She's not a little girl.

33
00:11:00,272 --> 00:11:03,708
DNA typing proves it was her.

34
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:06,864
She could be in Chicago,
Las Vegas, LA, anywhere.

35
00:11:06,952 --> 00:11:09,307
We should stop all the trains.

36
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:13,146
And have the police ask
questions we can't answer?

37
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:16,588
Put key personnel at every stop.

38
00:11:16,672 --> 00:11:20,347
I want a team to hunt her down.

39
00:11:22,272 --> 00:11:26,106
Good morning, Jill. Thank you
for taking care of my cat.

40
00:11:26,192 --> 00:11:28,706
We will, won't we, Lorca?

41
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:30,987
I won't be gone very long.

42
00:11:31,072 --> 00:11:34,747
- Take care of yourself.
- Bye-bye.

43
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:38,142
Do you still have problems
with people at work?

44
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:42,987
They say I'm the weird one,
I'm the strange one.

45
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:45,711
Why, because I have feelings?

46
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:48,022
Because I feel?

47
00:11:50,632 --> 00:11:52,623
There's someone at the door.

48
00:11:54,232 --> 00:11:57,144
They can come back
at the end of the hour.

49
00:11:57,832 --> 00:11:59,788
That's for me.

50
00:12:01,392 --> 00:12:04,384
Sorry to interrupt.
We need your help, Dan.

51
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:07,270
I know. Got to go.

52
00:13:15,506 --> 00:13:17,417
Oh, God.

53
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:30,189
Mr Fitch will be
with you all in a moment.

54
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:43,226
We all must be here for the same
reason, whatever that is.

55
00:13:43,317 --> 00:13:48,152
I'm Dan Smithson, and I don't
know why I'm here either.

56
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:52,992
But they said they needed me
and it was very important.

57
00:13:53,077 --> 00:13:55,511
What do you do, Dan?

58
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:58,714
I...l'm an empath.

59
00:14:01,117 --> 00:14:04,666
Sometimes they show me
awful things people have done

60
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:08,147
and I try to tell them
why they did it.

61
00:14:08,237 --> 00:14:11,149
What qualifies you for that?

62
00:14:11,237 --> 00:14:13,831
I feel things deeply.

63
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:18,511
What am I feeling right now?

64
00:14:19,997 --> 00:14:24,468
You want to believe
that nothing affects you,

65
00:14:24,557 --> 00:14:29,153
that...you're not afraid
of anything.

66
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:34,357
But you're curious,
just like the rest of us.

67
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:39,309
Steven Arden, Harvard
Anthropology Department,

68
00:14:39,397 --> 00:14:41,627
expert in cross-cultural
behaviour.

69
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:44,277
Laura Baker.
Molecular biologist.

70
00:14:44,357 --> 00:14:48,191
And who are you,
and what do you do?

71
00:14:48,277 --> 00:14:50,427
Preston Lennox.

72
00:14:50,517 --> 00:14:55,147
And if I'm here, the shit
has definitely hit the fan.

73
00:14:55,237 --> 00:14:58,388
What exactly is
your area of speciality?

74
00:14:58,477 --> 00:15:00,388
I'm a freelance solution

75
00:15:00,477 --> 00:15:02,627
to some of our
government's problems.

76
00:15:02,717 --> 00:15:05,390
And what might they be?

77
00:15:05,477 --> 00:15:10,073
The kind that people don't
usually like to talk about.

78
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:14,156
You hunt people, don't you?

79
00:15:17,997 --> 00:15:19,749
I guess so.

80
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:28,658
You in here, honey?
It's a little late for TV.

81
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:34,455
You in here, honey?

82
00:15:35,861 --> 00:15:39,331
Good evening. I'm Xavier Fitch.

83
00:15:39,421 --> 00:15:42,618
I'm in charge of this operation.

84
00:15:52,381 --> 00:15:56,932
In November of 1974,
a small group from S.E.T.I. -

85
00:15:57,021 --> 00:16:01,776
Search for Extraterrestrial
lntelligence -

86
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:06,218
sent out a message
to whoever might be listening.

87
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:08,815
They sent
about 0.25 of a kilobyte,

88
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,654
including structure
of human DNA,

89
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:13,652
map of our solar system,

90
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:16,972
population of the earth,
helpful facts like that.

91
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:19,291
In January of 1993,

92
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:22,100
they received a message back

93
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,810
from an extraterrestrial
unknown source.

94
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:28,972
That's great.

95
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:31,814
Intelligent life
beyond this planet?

96
00:16:31,901 --> 00:16:33,016
Yes.

97
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:35,331
There were two communications.

98
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:39,209
The first was
a superior catalyst for methane.

99
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:42,816
We can now produce
an infinite amount of energy

100
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,812
from this clean fuel.

101
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:48,780
This convinced us this was
a friendly intelligence.

102
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:53,412
The second message turned out
to be a new sequence of DNA,

103
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:56,971
with instructions on how
to combine it with ours.

104
00:16:57,061 --> 00:17:00,576
You can get feedback on it
from Dr Baker here.

105
00:17:00,661 --> 00:17:05,416
Basically, the new
combined DNA sequence

106
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:09,858
was injected into 100 human ova.

107
00:17:13,181 --> 00:17:15,490
We got seven to divide.

108
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:17,492
Four petered out.

109
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:20,653
Two were stored
in liquid nitrogen,

110
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:22,891
and we let one grow.

111
00:17:22,981 --> 00:17:25,541
That's its code name - Sil.

112
00:17:25,621 --> 00:17:27,851
That's after two hours...

113
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:30,650
one day...

114
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:33,456
two days.

115
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,009
- My God.
- This growth is amazing.

116
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:38,251
That's a week.

117
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,213
It's a girl.

118
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:43,532
Yes, l...we decided
to make it female

119
00:17:43,621 --> 00:17:48,297
so it would be more
docile and controllable.

120
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:51,293
Controllable?
You guys don't get out much.

121
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:55,971
That's one month
after she was born.

122
00:17:57,261 --> 00:17:59,650
So you kept her caged?

123
00:17:59,741 --> 00:18:01,697
We decided it would be safer.

124
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:05,694
She didn't like being
locked up or being alone.

125
00:18:05,781 --> 00:18:07,692
Didn't she?

126
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:14,539
She's hiding something inside.

127
00:18:14,621 --> 00:18:16,339
You're right, Dan.

128
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:19,731
This is three months
after she was born.

129
00:18:19,821 --> 00:18:21,095
Watch carefully.

130
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:25,695
- What was that?
- Back the tape up.

131
00:18:28,701 --> 00:18:30,612
Watch her eyes.

132
00:18:30,701 --> 00:18:34,137
Rapid eye movement...
She's dreaming.

133
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:37,616
She's having
horrible nightmares.

134
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,851
It's some kind
of anxiety reaction.

135
00:18:39,941 --> 00:18:42,580
Got me a little anxious.

136
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:45,459
It made the research team
anxious, too.

137
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,817
The decision was made
to terminate the experiment,

138
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:50,812
to run more research first.

139
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:58,494
- You were going to gas her?
- That was the decision.

140
00:18:58,581 --> 00:19:01,220
It makes you feel bad...

141
00:19:02,461 --> 00:19:05,021
..that you had to kill her.

142
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:06,739
I don't know.

143
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:13,295
Wow.

144
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:14,860
Yes.

145
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:21,896
Yesterday morning the body
of a transient was found

146
00:19:21,981 --> 00:19:25,098
in a siding near Salt Lake City.

147
00:19:25,181 --> 00:19:27,536
Preliminary DNA tests conclude

148
00:19:27,621 --> 00:19:30,852
he was killed by our creation.

149
00:19:30,941 --> 00:19:34,058
- Have you found other bodies?
- No, not yet.

150
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:35,256
You will.

151
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,491
She's a predator.

152
00:19:37,581 --> 00:19:41,699
Her eyes are in front so she can
judge the distance to her prey.

153
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,055
Right.

154
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:47,896
- Where did you learn that?
- I saw it on a documentary.

155
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:50,575
I caught that show myself.

156
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:52,572
Mr Lennox.

157
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:54,219
Yeah.

158
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:56,610
As the non-scientist amongst us,

159
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:59,773
are you clear
what's going on here?

160
00:19:59,861 --> 00:20:01,852
I think so.

161
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:04,216
You created a monster

162
00:20:04,301 --> 00:20:09,580
with some kind of formula
you got from outer space.

163
00:20:09,661 --> 00:20:14,257
It got away and you want us
to hunt it down and kill it.

164
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:17,811
- Is that pretty close?
- I guess.

165
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:22,893
You don't want us to capture
her alive and study her?

166
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:27,338
Laura, this is a
search-and-destroy operation.

167
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:32,017
Nobody asks me to find things
they don't want dead.

168
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:34,490
I'm sorry for you.

169
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:38,540
Yeah, well...thank you, Dan.

170
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:41,816
I'm sorry for her.

171
00:20:42,461 --> 00:20:45,817
May I have
your attention, please.

172
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:49,098
Welcome to Los Angeles,
California.

173
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,856
All passengers please disembark.

174
00:21:24,981 --> 00:21:29,418
This is the final boarding call
for train number 12

175
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:34,734
to Santa Barbara, San José,
San Francisco and Seattle.

176
00:22:06,901 --> 00:22:09,813
- Something bad happened here.
- No shit?

177
00:22:09,901 --> 00:22:13,416
Crushed her larynx.

178
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:16,573
She was afraid.
She's frightened.

179
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:19,812
Hungry, too, by the looks of it.

180
00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:23,530
She's definitely not on a diet.

181
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:25,577
She's storing up calories.

182
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:29,256
- Any ideas?
- Oh, my...!

183
00:22:31,461 --> 00:22:36,330
Well, that looks like
some sort of...chrysalis,

184
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,537
some kind of cocoon.

185
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:41,010
Are we looking for a giant moth?

186
00:22:41,101 --> 00:22:46,095
If that is a cocoon,
she'll be fully-grown now.

187
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:47,853
Fully-grown.

188
00:22:47,941 --> 00:22:52,173
Our people were looking
for a child.

189
00:22:52,261 --> 00:22:54,013
She is a child.

190
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:57,889
It stinks in here.
I'm going outside.

191
00:23:04,621 --> 00:23:08,091
Get the conductor's l.D.
and credit card numbers.

192
00:23:08,181 --> 00:23:12,094
Let's assume she took
them with her.

193
00:23:12,181 --> 00:23:14,172
I'll see to that.

194
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:17,651
She kills
if she feels threatened,

195
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:20,699
and has no remorse.

196
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:23,932
Los Angeles is perfect
for her. Anything goes.

197
00:23:24,021 --> 00:23:27,809
Very little is taboo
or unacceptable.

198
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:31,974
Whatever she does,
no one's going to notice.

199
00:23:32,061 --> 00:23:37,294
Well, Los Angeles is where
the battle will be fought...

200
00:23:37,381 --> 00:23:39,258
and won.

201
00:23:59,537 --> 00:24:01,732
You look very pretty.

202
00:24:03,657 --> 00:24:05,966
Do you have a hundred?

203
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:09,093
Here we are.

204
00:24:09,577 --> 00:24:13,411
You ought to be more careful
with your money.

205
00:24:13,497 --> 00:24:16,694
Not every body's as honest as me.

206
00:24:16,777 --> 00:24:19,211
Are you foreign?

207
00:24:21,497 --> 00:24:23,488
Do you speak English?

208
00:24:23,577 --> 00:24:25,249
Yes.

209
00:24:25,337 --> 00:24:28,010
Here. You keep this.

210
00:24:28,857 --> 00:24:31,735
Here, let me take this.

211
00:24:31,817 --> 00:24:33,614
Be careful here.

212
00:24:33,697 --> 00:24:35,415
Yes.

213
00:24:40,217 --> 00:24:42,412
Watch your step.

214
00:24:53,497 --> 00:24:56,330
Our laboratory is being moved

215
00:24:56,417 --> 00:25:00,729
to some empty virus research
labs at the university.

216
00:25:00,817 --> 00:25:03,889
It'll be operational by 8.00.

217
00:25:03,977 --> 00:25:08,846
- We'll go over in 15 minutes.
- What are we going to do?

218
00:25:08,937 --> 00:25:12,850
Process the evidence
we collected on the train.

219
00:25:12,937 --> 00:25:17,249
Couldn't we grow this creature
with just its own DNA,

220
00:25:17,337 --> 00:25:20,568
so we can investigate
its vulnerabilities?

221
00:25:20,657 --> 00:25:24,332
That'd be good.
Like to know how it feels.

222
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:27,136
If we could see it
without the camouflage...

223
00:25:27,217 --> 00:25:30,175
Then we'd know what
we're dealing with.

224
00:26:25,537 --> 00:26:27,732
Couple of bozos just ran out.

225
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:31,014
Yes, young lady, can I help you?

226
00:26:31,097 --> 00:26:32,894
I want a room.

227
00:26:32,977 --> 00:26:34,888
62, including tax.

228
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:52,489
Hi. Come here often?

229
00:26:52,573 --> 00:26:54,450
What's your sign?

230
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:06,922
Tired of brunette?

231
00:27:07,013 --> 00:27:09,402
Change the colour of your hair.

232
00:27:09,493 --> 00:27:11,609
Colour-tress.

233
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:22,443
I've just increased
the magnification.

234
00:27:27,053 --> 00:27:28,884
When I pierce the cell,

235
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:32,045
the foreign DNA
will be introduced.

236
00:27:41,853 --> 00:27:45,050
Shit! The camera's
just gone down.

237
00:27:45,133 --> 00:27:47,647
Um...excuse me.

238
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:49,883
Do you have a replacement?

239
00:27:49,973 --> 00:27:53,488
Yes, but it'll take time
for a technician to come over.

240
00:27:53,573 --> 00:27:56,326
It's a simple operation
to replace it.

241
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:59,166
Are you saying you can do it?

242
00:27:59,253 --> 00:28:02,768
Sure. I just need somebody
to give me a hand.

243
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:06,402
- No technicians in there.
- I'll do it.

244
00:28:06,493 --> 00:28:08,688
I'll do it.

245
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:10,889
- A man of action.
- That's me.

246
00:28:16,352 --> 00:28:19,742
Can you get that one for me?

247
00:28:41,992 --> 00:28:44,426
Give me the camera.

248
00:28:55,832 --> 00:28:58,471
Something's...something's wrong.

249
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,301
Christ, it's started already.

250
00:29:06,392 --> 00:29:08,587
Get the top back on.

251
00:29:08,672 --> 00:29:11,425
- What?
- Get the top back on.

252
00:29:12,672 --> 00:29:14,151
Here you go.

253
00:29:15,512 --> 00:29:17,343
It's penetrated the cell.

254
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:22,781
He dropped the bolt.

255
00:29:22,992 --> 00:29:25,904
- Find the bolt.
- I'm looking, Fitch.

256
00:29:27,792 --> 00:29:29,589
Can they hear me?

257
00:29:29,672 --> 00:29:33,665
Get the top back on
then I'll let you out.

258
00:29:37,632 --> 00:29:41,864
- It fell through the grate.
- Can you lift it?

259
00:29:43,632 --> 00:29:45,702
This isn't going to work!

260
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:49,262
Get the bolt
from under the grate!

261
00:29:49,352 --> 00:29:53,709
- The floor's welded down.
- Oh, my God!

262
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,307
God, I've never seen
anything like this.

263
00:29:57,392 --> 00:29:59,269
I can't let them out.

264
00:29:59,352 --> 00:30:01,263
Come on!

265
00:30:01,352 --> 00:30:04,105
Fitch, let us out of here!

266
00:30:04,192 --> 00:30:06,183
Open the goddamn door!

267
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:09,344
Not till I know what's in there.

268
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,504
- Let them out!
- I can't!

269
00:30:12,592 --> 00:30:16,710
Tell me it's going
to stop growing, Dan.

270
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:23,624
- Open the door!
- Press!

271
00:30:24,472 --> 00:30:26,463
What the fuck is that?

272
00:30:26,552 --> 00:30:28,907
Laura, get to the other door!

273
00:30:28,992 --> 00:30:33,031
- Let her out, Fitch!
- I can't do that.

274
00:30:33,112 --> 00:30:35,751
- Motherfucker!
- What's wrong with you?

275
00:30:35,832 --> 00:30:37,424
It's breaking out.

276
00:30:37,512 --> 00:30:40,948
I'll burn it! Out of the way!

277
00:30:44,352 --> 00:30:49,710
If you can't destroy it,
I have to burn the whole room.

278
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:52,590
You got two minutes to kill it.

279
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,630
Use the gas line
as a flame-thrower.

280
00:30:58,632 --> 00:31:00,543
It's under the table!

281
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:10,742
- Open the door!
- Shut up, Dan!

282
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,426
One minute remaining.

283
00:31:27,592 --> 00:31:30,664
It stopped moving.
I think I killed it.

284
00:31:30,752 --> 00:31:32,868
It's dead. Open the door.

285
00:31:32,952 --> 00:31:34,704
Let them out.

286
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,270
Oh, God, it's not dead.

287
00:31:48,272 --> 00:31:50,342
What will we do?

288
00:31:50,432 --> 00:31:52,992
30 seconds remaining.

289
00:31:53,072 --> 00:31:54,710
Open the door!

290
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:58,182
- Let them out!
- I have to follow protocol.

291
00:31:58,272 --> 00:32:00,581
- Protocol?
- For running this experiment.

292
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:03,027
You didn't tell them that!

293
00:32:03,112 --> 00:32:05,103
Fitch, let them out.

294
00:32:05,192 --> 00:32:08,946
- Let them out!
- I have to follow protocol.

295
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,104
Get out!

296
00:32:12,712 --> 00:32:15,510
3...2...1.

297
00:32:15,592 --> 00:32:17,503
I had no choice!

298
00:32:17,592 --> 00:32:20,629
We burn the room
if anything goes wrong.

299
00:32:34,849 --> 00:32:37,124
Where can I find a man?

300
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:41,407
There's plenty of guys
at the ld round the corner.

301
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:43,366
You'll meet somebody there.

302
00:32:43,449 --> 00:32:44,962
Thank you.

303
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:47,802
Just look for the long line.

304
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:50,164
Oh, I need your credit card,

305
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:53,924
for long-distance calls,
room damage, so forth.

306
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:55,283
Credit card?

307
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:57,803
Plastic...Amex, Visa?

308
00:32:57,889 --> 00:33:00,608
There you go. Thanks.

309
00:33:02,209 --> 00:33:04,040
Hey, wait a minute.

310
00:33:07,449 --> 00:33:10,964
You don't want this
falling into the wrong hands.

311
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:12,562
No.

312
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:21,123
Yeah.

313
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:24,121
The conductor's
credit card has turned up.

314
00:33:24,209 --> 00:33:25,688
Let's go.

315
00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:32,080
You two.

316
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:38,239
Enjoy yourself.

317
00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:41,287
You, legs, you're in.

318
00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:57,895
Hey, where are you from?

319
00:33:57,975 --> 00:34:00,284
- I'm foreign.
- You're what?

320
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:01,694
I'm foreign.

321
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:03,572
Foreign, really?

322
00:34:03,655 --> 00:34:05,805
I've a party to go to

323
00:34:05,895 --> 00:34:08,693
and no one to take me.

324
00:34:08,775 --> 00:34:13,087
- I'll take you.
- You will?

325
00:34:13,175 --> 00:34:17,646
I'm going to go to the little
girls' room. Wait here.

326
00:34:17,735 --> 00:34:20,090
I'll be right here.

327
00:34:18,354 --> 00:34:21,266
What's his name,
Greg or something?

328
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:29,428
Whatever it takes, right?

329
00:34:29,514 --> 00:34:32,392
Hey, all's fair in love and war.

330
00:34:38,354 --> 00:34:40,026
Buddy.

331
00:34:55,474 --> 00:34:58,113
Can't see much on that.

332
00:34:58,194 --> 00:35:02,904
Get this tape back
to the lab. Enhance it.

333
00:35:02,994 --> 00:35:04,985
She looks nice.

334
00:35:05,074 --> 00:35:08,271
Have you any idea
where she went?

335
00:35:08,354 --> 00:35:10,948
I'll find her.

336
00:35:11,034 --> 00:35:13,867
She wanted to meet a man.
I suggested the ld.

337
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:17,792
Get the tape.

338
00:35:34,754 --> 00:35:39,191
I've a party to go to
and no one to take me.

339
00:35:39,274 --> 00:35:42,346
- Where is this party?
- I don't know.

340
00:35:50,954 --> 00:35:54,549
You can't park there.

341
00:35:54,634 --> 00:35:57,068
You can't go in there.

342
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:59,270
What's going on here?

343
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:17,232
Nobody leaves the club, nobody.

344
00:36:20,114 --> 00:36:23,868
There's always some action
in this part of town.

345
00:36:36,954 --> 00:36:40,583
..blue-eyed blonde.
Who did she leave with?

346
00:36:40,674 --> 00:36:44,110
Blue-eyed blonde leaving
with a guy is hardly news.

347
00:36:44,194 --> 00:36:46,150
Name the top attractions.

348
00:36:46,234 --> 00:36:48,623
Assume he's socially adept.

349
00:36:48,714 --> 00:36:51,945
A friendly guy, not an asshole.

350
00:36:52,034 --> 00:36:54,707
- Robbie left with a blonde.
- That's him.

351
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,150
Let me show you
the rest of the house.

352
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:55,108
Let me show you
the rest of the house.

353
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:58,865
I'm still sweaty
from that place.

354
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,146
Like it?

355
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,109
Yes.

356
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:10,819
I feel like a shower.
You want one?

357
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,145
I'm going to take one.

358
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:17,700
Want to get in
and take one later?

359
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,980
Take off your clothes.

360
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,420
I want to see you.

361
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,661
Very nice.

362
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:27,419
- Can you drive me back?
- What are you talking about?

363
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:31,867
- You know why we came here.
- I've changed my mind.

364
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:34,020
All right. You said no.

365
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,260
It's duly noted. Come here.

366
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:40,548
- I said I want to go.
- You're not leaving!

367
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,587
All right.

368
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,626
That's better.

369
00:39:57,458 --> 00:40:01,576
What's happening?
Kills a girl, kills this guy.

370
00:40:01,658 --> 00:40:05,367
She fits the classic
definition of a psychopath.

371
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:07,369
Nothing to inhibit her,

372
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:09,892
no moral sense,
no social structure.

373
00:40:09,978 --> 00:40:13,653
She wasn't exactly smothered
with a mother's love.

374
00:40:13,738 --> 00:40:15,729
I asked what was happening.

375
00:40:15,818 --> 00:40:18,537
He did something to her.
She was angry .

376
00:40:18,618 --> 00:40:21,371
She'll kill anyone
that gets in her way.

377
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:23,414
In her way of what?

378
00:40:23,498 --> 00:40:27,047
Her life cycle. I think
she's trying to mate, reproduce.

379
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:30,414
So why did she kill the girl?

380
00:40:30,498 --> 00:40:34,013
- Sexual competition.
- She's hard on the competition.

381
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,656
Now she's mated.

382
00:40:35,738 --> 00:40:39,697
No. He's still got his pants on.

383
00:40:39,778 --> 00:40:42,053
- She's frustrated.
- Who isn't?

384
00:40:42,138 --> 00:40:44,413
What is her problem?

385
00:40:44,498 --> 00:40:46,534
Maybe she rejected him.

386
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:49,257
She probably has
some special senses.

387
00:40:49,338 --> 00:40:52,967
Rats can sense genetic damage
in potential mates.

388
00:40:53,058 --> 00:40:56,289
We can test his body
for any defects

389
00:40:56,378 --> 00:41:00,132
that would have made him
a loser, essentially.

390
00:41:00,218 --> 00:41:05,087
Needles. Maybe he was some
kind of doper or diabetic.

391
00:41:05,178 --> 00:41:10,047
Either way would have
made him unacceptable.

392
00:41:10,138 --> 00:41:12,049
All right.

393
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:16,328
Insulin. Diabetic.
There you have it.

394
00:41:16,418 --> 00:41:21,094
- But why kill him?
- I guess he pissed her off.

395
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,692
Some men don't like rejection.

396
00:41:23,778 --> 00:41:26,736
Put an APB out
on this guy's car.

397
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,730
I want to check out the motel.

398
00:41:29,818 --> 00:41:32,616
More docile and controllable?

399
00:41:46,498 --> 00:41:48,648
What do you think, Dan?

400
00:41:48,738 --> 00:41:51,298
I think she'd want to be alone.

401
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:56,133
I don't think she'll come here
with all these cars out front.

402
00:41:56,218 --> 00:41:58,937
Could she find
her way back here?

403
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:00,656
She could.

404
00:42:00,738 --> 00:42:02,774
What is it?

405
00:42:03,498 --> 00:42:05,454
Maybe menstrual blood.

406
00:42:05,538 --> 00:42:09,497
If she's menstruating,
she's capable of reproduction.

407
00:42:09,578 --> 00:42:11,489
Yes, I know.

408
00:43:40,107 --> 00:43:42,382
Oh, Jesus.

409
00:43:42,467 --> 00:43:45,664
- Excuse me.
- Call the paramedic!

410
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:06,784
The video enhancement
is not all that great.

411
00:44:06,867 --> 00:44:09,665
How old do you think
she is? 20? 23?

412
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,784
Her reproductive system
should be fully developed.

413
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:16,098
Her biological clock
must be in hyperdrive.

414
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:17,825
She wants a baby.

415
00:44:17,907 --> 00:44:20,023
If her offspring's male

416
00:44:20,107 --> 00:44:23,179
and develops
at the same rate as Sil,

417
00:44:23,267 --> 00:44:26,816
it could be capable
of reproduction in six months.

418
00:44:26,907 --> 00:44:31,059
God knows how many females
it could impregnate.

419
00:44:31,147 --> 00:44:32,978
Fitch.

420
00:44:33,067 --> 00:44:36,616
When a predatory
species is introduced

421
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:39,016
into a closed
ecological system,

422
00:44:39,107 --> 00:44:41,496
the extinction of the weaker
species is inevitable.

423
00:44:41,587 --> 00:44:44,465
They found
the murdered guy's BMW.

424
00:44:44,547 --> 00:44:47,141
- And what is her name?
- I don't know.

425
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:48,660
So who are you?

426
00:44:48,747 --> 00:44:52,501
Thought I'd come by
to make sure she's O.K.

427
00:44:52,587 --> 00:44:54,464
Is she insured?

428
00:44:54,547 --> 00:44:57,744
I don't know.
Put it on my credit card.

429
00:44:57,827 --> 00:45:00,978
Guys like you are hard to find.

430
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:06,223
Get a lab workup on that, stat.

431
00:45:06,993 --> 00:45:10,429
Arrange to get her up to X-ray.

432
00:45:10,513 --> 00:45:13,585
It looks like
a scapula fracture.

433
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:24,153
Your sh...your shoulder.

434
00:45:25,993 --> 00:45:27,870
What's going on?

435
00:45:34,073 --> 00:45:35,745
Doctor, we need you.

436
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:38,791
- A burn victim just came in.
- What's going on here?

437
00:45:38,873 --> 00:45:41,341
Did you see her shoulder?

438
00:45:41,433 --> 00:45:44,425
Doctor, please.
We need you immediately!

439
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:54,512
- You're O.K.
- I'm OK.

440
00:45:54,593 --> 00:45:57,551
I was sure you
were seriously injured.

441
00:45:57,633 --> 00:45:59,112
I'm OK.

442
00:45:59,193 --> 00:46:02,822
- It's a miracle.
- Can we go?

443
00:46:02,913 --> 00:46:05,143
Did the doctor say you could?

444
00:46:05,233 --> 00:46:06,586
Yes.

445
00:46:04,906 --> 00:46:05,466
We'll send somebody over.

446
00:46:05,466 --> 00:46:07,536
We'll send somebody over.

447
00:46:09,706 --> 00:46:11,776
A doctor at Parkbay Hospital

448
00:46:11,866 --> 00:46:14,300
called in with some weird story .

449
00:46:14,386 --> 00:46:16,502
We should check it out.

450
00:46:16,586 --> 00:46:20,261
Laura, Press,
take a car. Check it out.

451
00:46:20,346 --> 00:46:21,984
Parkbay Hospital?

452
00:46:22,066 --> 00:46:23,943
Yeah, Parkbay.

453
00:46:24,906 --> 00:46:26,658
She walked.

454
00:46:27,106 --> 00:46:28,664
She walked.

455
00:46:30,146 --> 00:46:31,545
That way.

456
00:46:31,626 --> 00:46:34,094
Not too long ago.

457
00:46:41,066 --> 00:46:44,024
Got some fruit and cheese here.

458
00:46:45,626 --> 00:46:48,823
- What is that?
- What, the hot tub?

459
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:50,897
Hot tub.

460
00:46:50,986 --> 00:46:53,454
I love this place.

461
00:46:53,546 --> 00:46:58,222
It's away from the traffic
and all the people.

462
00:46:59,346 --> 00:47:02,383
Here. We'll immortalise
the moment.

463
00:47:11,906 --> 00:47:13,942
Look at the camera.

464
00:47:20,066 --> 00:47:22,057
She reformed her bone structure!

465
00:47:22,146 --> 00:47:24,535
- It's her.
- Who checked her in?

466
00:47:24,626 --> 00:47:26,423
Let's find out.

467
00:47:26,506 --> 00:47:30,021
This guy put it
on his own credit card.

468
00:47:31,226 --> 00:47:33,945
Here's the file.
John F. Carey.

469
00:47:34,026 --> 00:47:36,779
You haven't got
a driver's licence,

470
00:47:36,866 --> 00:47:39,585
home address,
social security number?

471
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:42,180
I only got an imprint
of his credit card.

472
00:47:42,266 --> 00:47:45,144
Can you give us a print-out?

473
00:47:45,226 --> 00:47:46,898
No problem.

474
00:47:48,746 --> 00:47:50,737
Want some candy?

475
00:47:59,906 --> 00:48:04,058
It's an address in the
Palisades and a phone number.

476
00:48:04,146 --> 00:48:07,934
Tell Fitch where we're headed,
and try to call Carey.

477
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,786
I better get the phone.

478
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:37,860
I've got his machine.

479
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,384
Tell him he's about to copulate

480
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:42,904
with a creature
from outer space.

481
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:45,629
- Copulate?
- Yeah.

482
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,907
I like you.

483
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,423
I know.

484
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:56,860
It's not too soon
for us to be together.

485
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:59,305
No, it's not too soon.

486
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:03,386
You don't need these.

487
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:05,586
Hey, that's a little fast.

488
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:19,666
What's the matter?

489
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,627
Take it easy.

490
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:28,619
Just relax.
There's plenty of time.

491
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,506
What is it?

492
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:45,579
- I think someone's at the door.
- Don't go. Please.

493
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:48,230
- I want a baby.
- What?

494
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:01,138
Let's go around the side.

495
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:39,459
- What happened?
- It was a fucking squirrel.

496
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:42,269
- She was here?
- Yeah, she was.

497
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:45,308
Make sure she's not still here.

498
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:10,950
Perhaps we should check the body

499
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:14,022
for any evidence
they've had sex.

500
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:22,619
I used to be scared of blood.

501
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:25,861
Now I guess
I'm getting used to it.

502
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:27,906
Oh, yes?

503
00:53:44,101 --> 00:53:46,774
- Hey!
- Please help me!

504
00:53:46,861 --> 00:53:48,419
What's the matter?

505
00:53:48,501 --> 00:53:51,573
We found this
in the living room.

506
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:53,731
She liked him.

507
00:53:55,821 --> 00:53:57,652
Well, not enough.

508
00:53:57,741 --> 00:54:01,211
Can't see any more on that
than we did on the video.

509
00:54:01,301 --> 00:54:04,418
He didn't get
a very good picture of her.

510
00:54:04,501 --> 00:54:06,617
There's no semen in the water.

511
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,295
Maybe she took it with her.

512
00:54:09,381 --> 00:54:12,578
- She hasn't mated.
- We interrupted her.

513
00:54:12,661 --> 00:54:17,018
I think we did.
Give me something I can use!

514
00:54:17,101 --> 00:54:19,331
What have YOU come up with?

515
00:54:24,621 --> 00:54:27,658
She's not scared of us,
that's for sure.

516
00:54:30,341 --> 00:54:35,051
We're all beat.
We'll go to the hotel and rest.

517
00:54:35,141 --> 00:54:39,453
Tomorrow night...
we'll go back to the club...

518
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:41,771
..stake it out.

519
00:54:44,261 --> 00:54:46,252
She's not stupid.

520
00:54:46,341 --> 00:54:48,491
She won't repeat herself.

521
00:54:48,581 --> 00:54:51,573
And it provided
such a poor specimen.

522
00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:53,572
I'm not so sure.

523
00:54:53,661 --> 00:54:55,856
It's what she knows.

524
00:54:55,941 --> 00:55:01,061
I'd rather try the club than
sit around the command centre.

525
00:55:15,621 --> 00:55:19,091
She would make one
excellent biological weapon

526
00:55:19,181 --> 00:55:22,810
if someone out there thought
we were a galactic weed.

527
00:55:22,901 --> 00:55:28,339
You're saying she's the cure
and we're the disease?

528
00:55:29,101 --> 00:55:30,932
That's well said.

529
00:55:31,021 --> 00:55:33,296
"Baker, Laura.

530
00:55:33,381 --> 00:55:37,579
"1735 Meander Drive,
Simi Valley, California."

531
00:55:37,661 --> 00:55:40,971
- That's you, right?
- Last time I checked.

532
00:55:41,061 --> 00:55:43,291
What do you do
for kicks out there?

533
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:47,260
Oh, pine for guys like you.

534
00:55:47,341 --> 00:55:49,457
That's what I thought.

535
00:56:09,061 --> 00:56:10,972
Anyone hungry?

536
00:56:11,061 --> 00:56:13,621
No, thanks. I'm beat.

537
00:56:13,701 --> 00:56:16,135
I'll just try to get some sleep.

538
00:56:16,221 --> 00:56:17,859
Good night.

539
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:20,614
I'll have something
to eat with you.

540
00:56:20,701 --> 00:56:22,293
Thanks, Dan.

541
00:57:16,087 --> 00:57:18,840
- Do you ever have nightmares?
- Yes.

542
00:57:20,487 --> 00:57:24,116
Please untie my hands.
I wouldn't hurt you.

543
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:30,726
I have them. I think
they tell me who I am.

544
00:57:30,807 --> 00:57:33,196
Why are you doing this to me?

545
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:37,201
I don't know why I'm here.

546
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:42,486
I don't know who I am,
who sent me. Do you?

547
00:57:42,567 --> 00:57:44,046
No.

548
00:57:45,687 --> 00:57:47,962
Why do you think you're here?

549
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:50,083
I don't know.

550
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:52,522
Please let me go.

551
00:57:52,607 --> 00:57:55,405
Please, please let me go.

552
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:59,158
I wouldn't hurt you.

553
00:57:59,247 --> 00:58:01,841
I promise,
I wouldn't hurt you.

554
00:58:01,927 --> 00:58:03,246
Yes, you would.

555
00:58:03,327 --> 00:58:05,477
You just don't know it yet.

556
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:07,603
No, I wouldn't!

557
00:58:07,687 --> 00:58:09,598
Please.

558
00:58:11,127 --> 00:58:14,039
My hands are hurting me.

559
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:18,882
Oh, hey, thank you.

560
00:58:19,847 --> 00:58:21,326
Thank you.

561
00:58:26,527 --> 00:58:28,483
Oh, my God!

562
00:58:44,447 --> 00:58:46,642
Oh, my God, no!

563
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:49,319
No!

564
00:59:34,763 --> 00:59:37,880
Laura and Press like each other.

565
00:59:37,963 --> 00:59:40,318
They just don't like
to show how it.

566
00:59:40,403 --> 00:59:44,078
- What?
- They like each other.

567
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:46,199
Whatever you say, Dan.

568
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:49,480
I'm going to get a bit of air.

569
00:59:49,563 --> 00:59:52,077
I'll lie down in the van.

570
00:59:52,163 --> 00:59:54,472
This is a waste of time.

571
00:59:55,643 --> 00:59:58,874
Get the feeling
you're on a wild-goose chase?

572
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:01,875
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

573
01:00:51,141 --> 01:00:54,213
Get out of here.
This is my trash can!

574
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:06,333
It's you.

575
01:01:14,301 --> 01:01:16,132
She's here!

576
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:27,054
- Dan, is that her?
- Yeah, she's over here.

577
01:01:35,621 --> 01:01:38,215
Everybody get in the van!

578
01:01:45,901 --> 01:01:48,734
We'll need the helicopters.

579
01:02:00,461 --> 01:02:04,249
Try and block her at Mulholland.

580
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:21,974
Watch it!

581
01:03:21,261 --> 01:03:22,853
My God.

582
01:03:55,101 --> 01:03:57,899
We blocked the road
in both directions.

583
01:03:57,981 --> 01:04:00,620
We've got to tell
the press something.

584
01:04:00,701 --> 01:04:03,135
Just don't tell them the truth.

585
01:04:03,221 --> 01:04:06,372
I don't buy her
showing up at the club.

586
01:04:06,461 --> 01:04:09,180
or don't you trust your eyes?

587
01:04:09,261 --> 01:04:11,729
Get all these people back!

588
01:04:11,821 --> 01:04:14,654
Fitch, it doesn't feel right.

589
01:04:14,741 --> 01:04:17,733
We found what looks
like a severed thumb

590
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:19,891
in the pocket of a door.

591
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:23,371
She may have caught it,
trying to get out.

592
01:04:23,461 --> 01:04:29,616
The lab will determine
if it's hers.

593
01:04:29,701 --> 01:04:31,180
It's all over.

594
01:04:31,261 --> 01:04:33,570
You can go back to your lives.

595
01:04:36,101 --> 01:04:40,253
Just like that, huh, Fitch?
I don't think so.

596
01:04:49,421 --> 01:04:52,140
Hi, Chucklets.

597
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,132
Leave me a message.

598
01:04:54,221 --> 01:04:57,213
And, Frank,
where are we meeting?

599
01:04:53,797 --> 01:04:54,317
Waiter.

600
01:04:54,317 --> 01:04:55,545
Waiter.

601
01:04:55,957 --> 01:04:58,346
Well, I guess we won.

602
01:04:58,437 --> 01:05:01,588
We won. Science lost.

603
01:05:01,677 --> 01:05:05,192
I didn't think
we'd get her this easy.

604
01:05:05,277 --> 01:05:07,552
Sounds like you'll miss her.

605
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:10,197
I think I respected her.

606
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,387
This has been a hellish job,

607
01:05:13,477 --> 01:05:17,186
but I've really enjoyed
working with you three.

608
01:05:17,277 --> 01:05:20,314
Why don't we have another round?

609
01:05:20,397 --> 01:05:22,991
- Waiter!
- I don't drink, Art.

610
01:05:23,077 --> 01:05:24,635
Tonight you will.

611
01:05:25,757 --> 01:05:27,668
Want to dance?

612
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,225
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.

613
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:33,911
All right.

614
01:05:33,997 --> 01:05:35,430
OK.

615
01:05:49,477 --> 01:05:52,833
I know you don't have a family.

616
01:05:52,917 --> 01:05:55,385
Do you have a girlfriend?

617
01:05:55,477 --> 01:05:59,629
I've had a few, but they
don't hang around long.

618
01:05:59,717 --> 01:06:02,356
I keep too many secrets.

619
01:06:02,437 --> 01:06:04,428
Want to share one with me?

620
01:06:04,517 --> 01:06:06,314
Right now?

621
01:06:11,117 --> 01:06:15,429
Well, I know what you do,
and it doesn't scare me.

622
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:17,667
- Really?
- No.

623
01:06:17,757 --> 01:06:20,351
Well, it does most people.

624
01:06:23,877 --> 01:06:26,869
I wouldn't want
to never see you again.

625
01:06:34,797 --> 01:06:38,676
I'm sorry . I thought
you were somebody else.

626
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:45,790
- You OK?
- I thought it was Sil.

627
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:50,109
She's dead.
Tests on the thumb proved it.

628
01:06:50,197 --> 01:06:53,872
You got your test. I got my gut.

629
01:06:53,957 --> 01:06:59,554
Maybe you don't want
this job to be over.

630
01:06:59,637 --> 01:07:01,036
Maybe not.

631
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:03,187
So what?

632
01:07:05,717 --> 01:07:07,912
Thanks for the dance.

633
01:07:21,477 --> 01:07:23,388
Good night.

634
01:07:29,517 --> 01:07:33,749
- What do you call this?
- A Long lsland lced Tea.

635
01:07:33,837 --> 01:07:36,397
It's got tea in it?

636
01:07:36,477 --> 01:07:38,274
Nope.

637
01:07:49,234 --> 01:07:52,146
Smells nice. Can I try some?

638
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:54,145
Help yourself.

639
01:07:58,234 --> 01:08:01,192
Does it work on your boyfriend?

640
01:08:01,274 --> 01:08:03,469
Yeah, as a repellent.

641
01:08:05,354 --> 01:08:10,109
He's in remarkably good shape
for a man his age.

642
01:08:19,954 --> 01:08:22,787
One Long lsland lced Tea.

643
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:27,949
I like this cup...
these cups of tea.

644
01:08:29,274 --> 01:08:30,627
What?

645
01:08:30,714 --> 01:08:32,670
- That's great.
- What?

646
01:08:32,754 --> 01:08:34,551
What?

647
01:08:36,394 --> 01:08:38,669
Hey, give me one of those.

648
01:08:39,994 --> 01:08:42,508
I like these cups of tea.

649
01:08:42,594 --> 01:08:46,030
You guys, I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

650
01:08:47,994 --> 01:08:49,393
So?

651
01:08:50,754 --> 01:08:52,984
She's going to bed.

652
01:08:53,074 --> 01:08:54,871
I guess.

653
01:08:55,714 --> 01:09:00,105
She still, uh...
wants to see you, though.

654
01:09:02,594 --> 01:09:06,223
Maybe I'll go find out
if you're right.

655
01:09:20,946 --> 01:09:24,700
Hate to be in this
during an earthquake.

656
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:27,346
Yeah. What floor do you want?

657
01:09:27,426 --> 01:09:29,382
10, please.

658
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:40,696
I like your perfume.

659
01:09:40,786 --> 01:09:44,017
You do? Thank you.

660
01:09:44,106 --> 01:09:46,904
Excuse me. I get out here.

661
01:09:49,906 --> 01:09:51,862
Good night.

662
01:10:16,306 --> 01:10:17,739
Yes!

663
01:10:26,426 --> 01:10:28,894
- Hi.
- Hi.

664
01:10:45,386 --> 01:10:47,854
Did you want something?

665
01:10:47,946 --> 01:10:50,619
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

666
01:11:34,466 --> 01:11:36,297
Housekeeping.

667
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:40,224
Dan, those two over there.

668
01:11:40,306 --> 01:11:43,582
I bet they like
unusual men like us.

669
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:47,215
Women think I'm strange.

670
01:11:47,306 --> 01:11:52,903
- I don't feel well.
- Just go and talk to them

671
01:11:52,986 --> 01:11:57,184
I have to go. I think
you should leave with me.

672
01:11:57,266 --> 01:12:01,100
I'm going to stay
for a while, actually.

673
01:12:03,226 --> 01:12:04,898
OK.

674
01:12:04,986 --> 01:12:07,102
I'll see you tomorrow.

675
01:12:10,066 --> 01:12:11,784
Housekeeping.

676
01:12:25,746 --> 01:12:26,974
Hi.

677
01:12:27,066 --> 01:12:28,181
- Hi.
- Hi.

678
01:12:28,266 --> 01:12:30,257
I couldn't help wondering

679
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:34,305
what two very intelligent,
glamorous-looking women

680
01:12:34,386 --> 01:12:36,138
were doing without dates.

681
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:38,217
I teach anthropology
at Harvard.

682
01:12:38,306 --> 01:12:42,299
I lived in Boston for a year.
Froze my butt off.

683
01:12:42,386 --> 01:12:45,423
This is Bill and Tony.

684
01:12:50,906 --> 01:12:52,703
Give me those socks.

685
01:12:53,466 --> 01:12:55,263
Stand up.

686
01:13:20,241 --> 01:13:23,074
- How'd you get in here?
- I stole the key.

687
01:13:23,161 --> 01:13:24,640
What?

688
01:13:25,561 --> 01:13:27,756
I saw you downstairs

689
01:13:27,841 --> 01:13:30,480
and thought
I'd come up and wait.

690
01:13:32,121 --> 01:13:35,716
Whoa! This kind of thing
doesn't happen to me.

691
01:13:36,801 --> 01:13:39,361
I just want to be with you.

692
01:13:48,961 --> 01:13:51,919
Oh, yes. Yes!

693
01:13:53,081 --> 01:13:54,958
Oh, yes.

694
01:14:03,441 --> 01:14:05,557
What about protection?

695
01:14:58,161 --> 01:15:00,516
She's here. She's here.

696
01:15:27,721 --> 01:15:30,315
- Press?
- Huh?

697
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:32,471
Someone's at the door.

698
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:34,713
Who's there?

699
01:15:34,801 --> 01:15:38,396
It's Dan. I got to talk to you.

700
01:15:38,481 --> 01:15:40,915
Christ, what does he want?

701
01:15:49,841 --> 01:15:52,435
What's the problem, Dan?

702
01:15:52,521 --> 01:15:55,479
I just got
this terrible feeling.

703
01:15:55,561 --> 01:15:57,995
Sil's next door
with Arden, Press.

704
01:15:58,081 --> 01:16:00,754
No, no, no. She's dead.

705
01:16:00,841 --> 01:16:04,390
There's somebody with him.

706
01:16:04,481 --> 01:16:06,551
Did you knock on the door?

707
01:16:06,641 --> 01:16:07,960
Yeah.

708
01:16:08,041 --> 01:16:10,509
They're making a lot of noise.

709
01:16:10,601 --> 01:16:13,991
They're having sex.
I KNOW it's Sil.

710
01:16:15,881 --> 01:16:18,111
OK, I'll get dressed.

711
01:16:26,921 --> 01:16:29,355
Oh, my God.

712
01:16:32,361 --> 01:16:35,114
Well, I enjoyed that immensely.

713
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:55,399
- I felt it.
- What?

714
01:16:57,961 --> 01:17:00,077
It's started.

715
01:17:00,161 --> 01:17:01,879
What's started?

716
01:17:01,961 --> 01:17:03,713
Life.

717
01:17:03,801 --> 01:17:06,440
Oh, my darling girl...

718
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:08,557
I know some women believe

719
01:17:08,641 --> 01:17:11,553
they know the exact moment
of conception...

720
01:17:11,641 --> 01:17:13,518
Don't you believe me? Feel.

721
01:17:18,161 --> 01:17:19,116
Holy shit!

722
01:17:22,414 --> 01:17:25,326
I hope you're right
about this, Dan.

723
01:17:35,454 --> 01:17:38,207
She's headed for the basement!

724
01:17:38,294 --> 01:17:41,809
We'll take the stairs!
Laura, come with me.

725
01:17:43,334 --> 01:17:45,325
If she's pregnant,

726
01:17:45,414 --> 01:17:49,043
we got to get to her
before she gives birth.

727
01:17:49,134 --> 01:17:52,524
We don't know what
we're dealing with.

728
01:17:52,614 --> 01:17:56,163
She could have a dozen babies,
lay 1,000 eggs.

729
01:17:56,214 --> 01:18:00,651
- God, did you see Arden?
- Yeah, the poor bastard.

730
01:18:00,734 --> 01:18:03,692
If they make it,
we'll have her trapped.

731
01:18:03,774 --> 01:18:06,447
The fire doors
only open from inside.

732
01:18:08,534 --> 01:18:10,411
Holy shit.

733
01:18:10,494 --> 01:18:13,486
The bitch went right
through a steel door.

734
01:18:13,574 --> 01:18:16,168
Fitch! Dan! She got past us.

735
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:28,212
You saw her?

736
01:18:28,294 --> 01:18:31,206
She was gone before we got here.

737
01:18:31,294 --> 01:18:33,603
Look at the door.

738
01:18:33,694 --> 01:18:36,652
- Where's Press?
- Down that tunnel.

739
01:18:49,254 --> 01:18:53,805
She kills
if she feels threatened.

740
01:19:15,934 --> 01:19:19,051
She must have come through here.

741
01:19:21,002 --> 01:19:24,472
She went down here.
There's no other way.

742
01:19:24,562 --> 01:19:29,238
- Yeah. She's down there.
- Let's go.

743
01:19:29,322 --> 01:19:32,758
Stand back. I'll clear it out.

744
01:20:21,162 --> 01:20:24,438
Which way do you think
she went, Dan?

745
01:20:24,522 --> 01:20:28,071
I don't know. I'm not sure.

746
01:20:28,162 --> 01:20:30,801
Think, for Christ's sake!

747
01:20:30,882 --> 01:20:34,955
You're supposed to have
extrasensory powers.

748
01:20:35,042 --> 01:20:37,112
Which way did she go, Dan?

749
01:20:37,202 --> 01:20:40,638
- I don't know.
- Which way did she go?

750
01:20:40,722 --> 01:20:43,839
I think she went that way.

751
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:46,152
That's good enough for me.

752
01:20:46,242 --> 01:20:51,191
You think, but you don't
fucking know, do you?

753
01:20:51,282 --> 01:20:54,911
I'm going this way.
Come with me, Dan!

754
01:20:55,002 --> 01:20:58,881
I think...l think
she went this way.

755
01:22:04,482 --> 01:22:06,518
What happened?

756
01:22:14,602 --> 01:22:18,038
I can feel her. She's that way.

757
01:22:18,122 --> 01:22:20,113
She's that way.

758
01:22:24,522 --> 01:22:28,913
I never thought I'd
want to kill something.

759
01:23:02,202 --> 01:23:05,717
It's this way It's back here.

760
01:23:34,962 --> 01:23:37,522
Hey, she went in here.

761
01:23:41,162 --> 01:23:45,838
This must have opened up
during the earthquake.

762
01:23:45,922 --> 01:23:48,152
OK, stand back.

763
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:44,747
Wow.

764
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:50,063
- Is that oil?
- Looks like it.

765
01:24:57,110 --> 01:25:00,147
I'll see if I can flush her out.

766
01:25:00,230 --> 01:25:03,939
If she comes back here,
let her have it.

767
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:19,499
Dan, what is it?

768
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:21,581
I don't know.

769
01:27:25,836 --> 01:27:27,588
OK...

770
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:30,746
It's OK.

771
01:27:30,836 --> 01:27:33,350
Nobody's going to hurt you.

772
01:27:33,436 --> 01:27:37,429
You come here. Come on.

773
01:27:37,516 --> 01:27:39,666
Come on. I got ya.

774
01:27:44,116 --> 01:27:47,108
Press, something's
happened to Dan!

775
01:27:51,636 --> 01:27:53,149
Shit!

776
01:27:57,276 --> 01:28:00,985
Dan? I'm stuck.

777
01:28:04,156 --> 01:28:08,911
I need your help. I'm stuck!

778
01:28:35,396 --> 01:28:38,115
Dan, hang on.

779
01:28:49,516 --> 01:28:51,234
Hang on!

780
01:29:24,592 --> 01:29:27,106
Don't fall!

781
01:29:52,072 --> 01:29:54,381
Hang on, Dan!

782
01:29:54,472 --> 01:29:55,905
Hang on!

783
01:29:57,312 --> 01:29:59,064
I got you!

784
01:29:59,152 --> 01:30:02,462
I got you, Dan. Hang on.

785
01:30:14,472 --> 01:30:16,428
Hang on, Dan!

786
01:30:20,552 --> 01:30:22,782
Get rid of her, Press!

787
01:30:25,472 --> 01:30:27,861
Duck your head!

788
01:30:28,952 --> 01:30:31,546
Let go, you motherfucker.

789
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:36,865
I got you. Hold on.

790
01:30:41,552 --> 01:30:43,907
I thought I was dead.

791
01:30:46,832 --> 01:30:50,108
I thought you drank your
last Long lsland lced Tea there.

792
01:30:50,192 --> 01:30:52,752
I thought we all had.

793
01:30:53,472 --> 01:30:55,622
You OK?

794
01:30:55,712 --> 01:30:57,748
Yeah, I'm OK.

795
01:30:57,832 --> 01:31:00,630
My pants are a little messed up,

796
01:31:00,712 --> 01:31:02,703
but I'm OK.

797
01:31:04,552 --> 01:31:07,225
She was half us,
half something else.

798
01:31:07,312 --> 01:31:10,065
Which was the predatory half?

799
01:31:10,152 --> 01:31:12,905
The dead half.

800
01:31:12,992 --> 01:31:15,426
Let's get out of here.

801
01:31:55,592 --> 01:31:58,390
I never thought I'd be so happy

802
01:31:58,472 --> 01:32:01,191
to be back in a sewer.

803
