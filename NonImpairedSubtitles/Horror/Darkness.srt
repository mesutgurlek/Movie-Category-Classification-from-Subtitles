1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,760
Now, I want you to try and
tell us everything that happened

2
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,599
Anything you can remember

3
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,361
I can't, I can't remember

4
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:39,481
We need your help so we
can find the other children

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,001
A house

6
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:53,161
- What?
- They took us to a house

7
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,201
- Who?
- I don't know... people

8
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:06,842
Do you think the other
children are still there?

9
00:01:11,562 --> 00:01:14,201
Do you think they've been hurt?

10
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,122
Yes

11
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:28,562
You're doing just fine
We're going to find them

12
00:01:33,122 --> 00:01:37,283
But We need you to tell us more
You've got to try and remember

13
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:44,642
I can't, I can't remember anything

14
00:02:06,284 --> 00:02:08,204
Shit!

15
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:32,204
- Drink it
- But...

16
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,564
No complaints. Drink

17
00:03:17,326 --> 00:03:20,205
- Did you get 'em?
- Get what?

18
00:03:20,446 --> 00:03:21,406
The pencils

19
00:03:23,606 --> 00:03:24,326
Yeah

20
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,046
Has he had breakfast?

21
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:31,206
- We're on it. How did it go?
- I'm brushed...

22
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:33,847
I think it's going to take
me a while to get used to it...

23
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:35,646
...and on top of that, night shifts

24
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:38,567
Don't worry, you're just starting

25
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:41,806
Anyhow I'm going to my father
about getting your shift changed

26
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:43,007
We'll see

27
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:45,687
Do you know where the toaster is?

28
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:48,567
I have no idea

29
00:03:50,248 --> 00:03:52,767
We still have tons of boxes left to open

30
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:57,888
Unless you give me a hand, I give up

31
00:04:26,128 --> 00:04:27,049
Hey, big guy

32
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:28,168
Hi

33
00:04:31,929 --> 00:04:33,969
- Today's your first day, isn't it?
- Yeah

34
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:36,169
- You nervous?
- A little

35
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:39,369
You'll see that you'll like it
You'll make lots of friends soon

36
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:40,329
Come on, Paul

37
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,249
You're gonna be late, come on

38
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,408
Bye

39
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:49,570
It's about time

40
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,129
I was just about to get you up

41
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:55,049
We've got to do

42
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:56,809
It's too early

43
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,090
And I have swim practice

44
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:01,570
That's not for two hours

45
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,089
And travel

46
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:07,010
This is the sticks, I have
to take the bus everywhere

47
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,530
I'm not waiting any longer for this
to start looking like a real house

48
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,370
We've been here almost three weeks,

49
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,410
and with the notable
exception of myself,

50
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,970
one has unpacked one single box

51
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,090
And don't forget, you promised
you were going to paint your room

52
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,092
Mom, I don't I don't know if I'm staying

53
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,451
I thought we discussed this, Reggie

54
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:35,691
You know how your father and I feel

55
00:05:35,932 --> 00:05:36,851
When have you ever listened to me?

56
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:39,691
I just want to finish school
in the States with my friends

57
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:41,972
Is that so abnormal?

58
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:03,492
- Hi
- Hi

59
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:18,332
What are you doing here?

60
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:20,852
You're crazy

61
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,812
I'm not doing anything wrong

62
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:26,334
I'm just here to pick
up my American friend

63
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:30,092
Well, you got here too
late 'cause I got to go

64
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:32,774
Just tell me if you're gonna stay

65
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:34,452
I'm not

66
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,134
- Come on, you got to go
- Why not?

67
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:40,334
Go, please

68
00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:42,573
They saw you

69
00:06:45,534 --> 00:06:47,494
- We'll talk about it later
- Promise?

70
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:49,654
I promise

71
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,214
I'm warning you,

72
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:04,094
it's not going to be easy for your
family to live in another country

73
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:05,414
Especially for the kids

74
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,974
Oh, I know It's a big move I'm
sure hoping they'll get used to it

75
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:11,894
It's a great place

76
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,414
Think so?

77
00:07:14,015 --> 00:07:15,375
It needs work

78
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:16,655
Yeah, That's true

79
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,495
A hammer and nails and a
bit of paint, you'll see

80
00:07:19,174 --> 00:07:21,215
Plus I got one month
before semester starts

81
00:07:22,134 --> 00:07:23,255
Good luck

82
00:07:27,536 --> 00:07:28,895
Did you meet?

83
00:07:29,495 --> 00:07:31,615
- No Hi
- How ya doing?

84
00:07:31,855 --> 00:07:33,856
I was just saying, it's
like a dream come true

85
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:35,855
You know what? He's lying

86
00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:54,656
You don't want to play anymore?

87
00:08:01,536 --> 00:08:02,736
Oh, thanks

88
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:07,457
Everybody seems to be
having a good time, right?

89
00:08:10,815 --> 00:08:14,496
Paul reminds me of Mark
when he was that age

90
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:16,097
Before he...

91
00:08:17,537 --> 00:08:18,697
...left

92
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,817
Now you'll have your
grandchildren all to yourself

93
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,216
and you're gonna get sick of them

94
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:27,017
Yes

95
00:08:28,097 --> 00:08:29,657
It must be strange for them

96
00:08:31,698 --> 00:08:33,017
Poor Paul

97
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:40,457
He'll end up crazy about you... you'll see

98
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,538
I'm gonna get jealous

99
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,939
It's good to see you, dad

100
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,659
That's it, it's over

101
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:27,579
Finally I thought it would never end

102
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,740
Way to close a party

103
00:10:14,342 --> 00:10:15,781
Not again

104
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,262
<i>...experts suggest to be cautious.
Never look directly at the sun...</i>

105
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:18,223
<i>...nor the optical device...</i>

106
00:11:18,862 --> 00:11:23,144
<i>...so take care, but make sure not to miss
it. Don't forget it's a unique event,</i>

107
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:24,744
<i>...a very special eclipse...</i>

108
00:11:24,982 --> 00:11:29,304
<i>...that takes place only every 40
years and there are just 5 days to go...</i>

109
00:11:35,944 --> 00:11:39,824
- You lived here with grandpa?
- Yeah, when I was your age

110
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:42,184
That's when you left for the States?

111
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:45,224
Why did you have to?

112
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,745
Well, your grandparents
decided to split up and

113
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,545
I didn't have a choice, I had to go

114
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:52,225
With your mom?

115
00:11:53,185 --> 00:11:54,184
That's right

116
00:12:00,945 --> 00:12:02,345
Are you and mom going

117
00:12:02,585 --> 00:12:04,345
- To split up?
- No

118
00:12:05,464 --> 00:12:07,625
Only families that
don't get along split up

119
00:12:08,305 --> 00:12:09,905
We get along, don't we?

120
00:12:10,785 --> 00:12:11,625
Yeah

121
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,905
It's the second day and I
bet I'm the only one late

122
00:12:28,465 --> 00:12:29,545
Don't worry, you'll make it

123
00:12:32,227 --> 00:12:33,866
"We're like the lonely wildebeest

124
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:38,107
bleating his plaintive
poetry to the infinite herd"

125
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,346
Hey dad, do you even
know what a wildebeest is?

126
00:12:40,586 --> 00:12:41,466
Sure it's

127
00:12:42,907 --> 00:12:44,746
It's like a cow

128
00:12:45,787 --> 00:12:47,307
And what's your cow saying?

129
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:49,826
"Get your ass

130
00:12:50,547 --> 00:12:53,627
out of my face"

131
00:12:55,187 --> 00:12:58,426
"Get your ass

132
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,187
out of my face"

133
00:13:08,707 --> 00:13:10,627
Dad look, it worked

134
00:13:21,787 --> 00:13:22,588
Dad?

135
00:13:49,109 --> 00:13:51,148
Hey, shithead, what
are you doing? Move it!

136
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:52,709
Fuck!

137
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:01,629
Help me!

138
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:03,789
Help me!

139
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:05,349
Please!

140
00:14:39,631 --> 00:14:42,750
- When Was his last attack?
- More than ten years ago

141
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:46,391
Haughtington is unpredictable,
but it doesn't have to be serious

142
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:49,351
As quickly as it has come, it can go

143
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:52,391
I don't know

144
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:55,631
I'm going to give him Haloperidol

145
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:59,912
But if he does have an attack,
you know about the risk of choking

146
00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:03,312
Just keep a close eye on him

147
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:05,871
This couldn't come at a worse time

148
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,192
Don't worry, everything will be fine

149
00:15:09,432 --> 00:15:10,392
Trust me

150
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:38,032
Dad

151
00:15:38,473 --> 00:15:40,992
I'm okay sweetie, nothing's happened

152
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:43,314
Come on, let's go inside

153
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,593
We've still got a lot
of work ahead of us

154
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:51,673
This is going to be the
best house in the whole world

155
00:15:53,273 --> 00:15:54,074
Mom?

156
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:56,994
What happened?

157
00:15:57,313 --> 00:15:59,153
Your father had a small attack,

158
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:01,513
but it's nothing, don't worry

159
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:03,673
I've been talking to your grandfather

160
00:16:03,913 --> 00:16:05,274
He's got to go back on medication
for a while and that's all

161
00:16:05,594 --> 00:16:06,194
Mom

162
00:16:07,554 --> 00:16:08,713
It's starting again

163
00:16:09,473 --> 00:16:10,715
Nothing is starting again

164
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:14,074
This is an isolated incident
Don't blow it out of proportion

165
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,274
You remember what happened

166
00:16:16,674 --> 00:16:18,314
You know exactly what this is

167
00:16:18,914 --> 00:16:20,153
And just now

168
00:16:21,474 --> 00:16:22,915
Just now what?

169
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,354
We're completely isolated, what
if something were to happen?

170
00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:27,874
We're ten minutes away from
downtown and I already told you,

171
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:29,114
nothing's going to happen

172
00:16:29,634 --> 00:16:31,274
- Mom
- What?

173
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,755
If you don't like this
house or your family,

174
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:35,474
then get your things and go

175
00:16:36,155 --> 00:16:38,235
Isn't that what you wanted, to go?

176
00:16:38,794 --> 00:16:39,915
Well, go on then!

177
00:16:40,595 --> 00:16:41,994
I think we'll survive

178
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:50,875
<i>Since the beginning of time...</i>

179
00:16:51,115 --> 00:16:53,276
<i>...people considered this
phenomenon in different ways...</i>

180
00:16:53,516 --> 00:16:55,514
<i>...but how do eclipses exactly work?...</i>

181
00:16:55,996 --> 00:16:57,716
- Feeling better?
- No

182
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:02,275
Come on, I fight with
my Mom all the time

183
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:03,996
It's normal

184
00:17:05,997 --> 00:17:07,156
No it's not

185
00:17:08,837 --> 00:17:10,556
She's never been this cruel before

186
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,676
I bet she didn't even notice

187
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:23,396
- Sometimes people say things that...
- I don't care

188
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:27,516
I'm not comfortable

189
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:31,237
I don't feel happy in that house

190
00:18:16,238 --> 00:18:17,799
- Hey there, Tiger
- Hi

191
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:19,159
What are you doing?

192
00:18:19,838 --> 00:18:20,639
Drawing

193
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:34,559
You don't play with this anymore

194
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,239
You used to like it

195
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:39,639
Are you going to die?

196
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,679
No

197
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,559
Listen buddy, what
happened is that your dad...

198
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,760
I got a little too tense

199
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
this morning

200
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,920
Forget about it

201
00:18:58,681 --> 00:18:59,680
You're not going to let

202
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,360
that worry you, are you?

203
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,961
Come on...

204
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,320
...time for bed

205
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,642
Dad?

206
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:28,921
don't...

207
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,681
Come on...

208
00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:31,961
...lights out

209
00:20:52,763 --> 00:20:54,924
- You okay?
- Yeah

210
00:21:21,005 --> 00:21:22,165
What are you doing up?

211
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:26,244
I couldn't sleep

212
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:29,204
Dad said I couldn't leave a light on

213
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:32,485
- Since when are you afraid of the dark?
- I'm not

214
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:33,326
So?

215
00:21:33,845 --> 00:21:35,965
It's different here... the dark

216
00:21:36,647 --> 00:21:37,766
What do you mean?

217
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:39,726
It eats my pencils

218
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:44,926
Come on, I'll tell you what, how’ bout
we make a deal? I'll lie down with you

219
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,127
- Until you fall asleep
- Promise?

220
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:48,486
Of course

221
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:50,407
Just give me a minute

222
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:51,967
Okay

223
00:22:37,849 --> 00:22:41,087
- I can't find anything wrong
- There's definitely something wrong

224
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,968
Maybe you should check again

225
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,328
I don't know what it could be

226
00:22:44,728 --> 00:22:46,448
Look, I'll check the sockets

227
00:22:56,247 --> 00:22:58,569
Where's my drawing pad?
I left it here last night

228
00:22:59,368 --> 00:23:02,209
- These are kind of weird drawings
- They're not weird

229
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:04,048
They're just drawings

230
00:23:05,408 --> 00:23:07,488
Yeah, but you keep on
doing the same thing

231
00:23:07,729 --> 00:23:09,529
They're not the same, they're different

232
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:11,330
They look the same to me

233
00:23:13,368 --> 00:23:14,888
That's because they're all children

234
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:17,450
But they're different children

235
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:21,649
Paul?

236
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:24,330
What's this? Did you hurt yourself?

237
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,009
I don't know

238
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,690
Has mommy seen it?

239
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,530
Yeah, she says I probably
did it in my sleep

240
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:32,850
When it was dark

241
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,249
I'm going

242
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,570
If you go outside, don't
go near the road Okay?

243
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,370
Okay

244
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:53,651
What are you doing here?

245
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,090
I need to use up the last few frames
on this roll and you will be my model

246
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:01,852
I like you as a photographer, but I
think I like you better as a painter

247
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:06,771
Oh, Dad, this is Carlos

248
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:09,011
- Hi
- Hi Nice to meet you

249
00:24:10,051 --> 00:24:11,691
Do you know anything about electricity?

250
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,571
No

251
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,412
Come on

252
00:24:30,492 --> 00:24:31,852
It doesn't look like mold...

253
00:24:32,212 --> 00:24:34,531
...it's more like rust

254
00:24:35,453 --> 00:24:36,413
I don't understand

255
00:24:37,132 --> 00:24:39,412
They painted the whole
house before we moved in

256
00:24:40,972 --> 00:24:41,892
Trust me, baby...

257
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:44,413
...this is going to look great

258
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:45,972
It better

259
00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:49,572
And I'm gonna go get some
paint thinner, just in case

260
00:24:52,013 --> 00:24:53,893
If you want, phone the electric company

261
00:24:54,132 --> 00:24:55,613
The hell with that, there's
something here that doesn't work

262
00:24:56,093 --> 00:24:59,253
We've been here for three weeks
now, and every day the lights go out

263
00:24:59,613 --> 00:25:02,453
They flicker, like the voltage
dropped Do you understand?

264
00:25:03,332 --> 00:25:04,893
Look, if I were you,
I'd talk to the neighbors

265
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:06,492
If it's a supply thing, they'll
have noticed something too

266
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:08,814
What neighbors? We don't have neighbors

267
00:25:09,093 --> 00:25:10,173
This is a fucking nightmare

268
00:25:10,774 --> 00:25:12,333
Calm down, okay? I've done all I can

269
00:25:12,573 --> 00:25:14,614
In other words, fuck you, right?

270
00:25:14,854 --> 00:25:16,854
In my own house, and in my face Fuck you!

271
00:25:19,013 --> 00:25:21,814
Well, you're not getting a
penny from me. Not a goddamn penny

272
00:25:22,213 --> 00:25:25,454
The insurance company will pay
me either way. Tell it to them

273
00:26:07,296 --> 00:26:08,416
Not now

274
00:26:09,576 --> 00:26:10,695
What's wrong?

275
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:14,256
I'm staying

276
00:26:17,496 --> 00:26:18,896
I can't leave now

277
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,776
I'm not going to ask you why

278
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:30,576
That's probably a good idea

279
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,337
What are you doing up? It's late

280
00:27:01,016 --> 00:27:02,258
I was waiting up for you

281
00:27:07,777 --> 00:27:08,857
I'm bushed

282
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:14,058
I hope you painted that room

283
00:27:14,897 --> 00:27:16,297
I need to talk to you

284
00:27:16,578 --> 00:27:18,618
Tomorrow I'm wrecked

285
00:27:20,778 --> 00:27:23,058
You can't imagine how
busy it's been today

286
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:26,739
Why can't we just talk?

287
00:27:27,578 --> 00:27:28,938
There’s something I need to tell you

288
00:27:32,298 --> 00:27:33,899
You say not to worry but...

289
00:27:34,538 --> 00:27:36,418
Dad is a bundle of nerves

290
00:27:36,898 --> 00:27:39,218
You should have seen the way he blew
up at the electrician this morning

291
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:41,819
Oh, he's just...

292
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,058
- And like, Paul's not well. I mean...
- Paul's okay

293
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,859
Look at the drawings

294
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:52,098
I mean, does this look like the kind

295
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:54,100
of thing normal kids do? I mean

296
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:58,019
He's a kid You should have seen
the ones you used to make. Come on

297
00:29:01,342 --> 00:29:02,101
Don't touch it!

298
00:29:03,861 --> 00:29:04,783
Sorry

299
00:29:05,862 --> 00:29:07,981
These old things can be pretty delicate

300
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:11,462
What's that?

301
00:29:13,662 --> 00:29:15,822
A room. Hidden behind the wall

302
00:29:16,342 --> 00:29:17,582
How did you know it was there?

303
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:19,062
Paul told me

304
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:21,741
Hey, check it out

305
00:29:25,342 --> 00:29:26,943
What about hanging it here?

306
00:29:32,342 --> 00:29:33,543
Fuck!

307
00:29:34,663 --> 00:29:35,502
It works

308
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:38,103
That's the beauty of old things...

309
00:29:38,982 --> 00:29:40,543
...no electricity required

310
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:43,503
I'll stop it

311
00:29:44,063 --> 00:29:44,943
No

312
00:29:51,143 --> 00:29:54,744
And you, little psychic. How
did you know that room was there?

313
00:29:55,224 --> 00:29:57,224
What are you talking about?

314
00:29:59,784 --> 00:30:03,344
- Dad said you told him it was there
- I didn't say anything. That's a lie

315
00:30:03,744 --> 00:30:05,784
You want to be a martyr, fine

316
00:30:06,023 --> 00:30:08,384
If you keep this up, I
don't know what we'll do

317
00:30:11,104 --> 00:30:12,224
What's going on?

318
00:30:12,984 --> 00:30:16,904
Nothing. Your brother's gone and
bruised himself again. That's all

319
00:30:18,185 --> 00:30:19,104
Clumsy

320
00:30:22,105 --> 00:30:23,425
Who did this to you?

321
00:30:25,706 --> 00:30:27,226
Oh, Reggie don't start

322
00:30:27,464 --> 00:30:28,705
Please, don't get paranoid

323
00:30:29,345 --> 00:30:30,505
Don't get paranoid?
This has happened twice

324
00:30:31,505 --> 00:30:34,184
Are you trying to tell me
there's nothing going on?

325
00:30:34,426 --> 00:30:37,706
That's not what I'm saying.
All I'm saying is these things happen

326
00:30:38,585 --> 00:30:39,985
He's got to be more careful, that's all

327
00:30:40,225 --> 00:30:42,145
Mom, why do you refuse to see what
is staring you clearly in the face?

328
00:30:42,386 --> 00:30:44,066
This is not normal

329
00:30:44,305 --> 00:30:45,905
We'll talk to your grandpa.
Maybe he can talk to Paul, I don't know

330
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:47,384
What more do you want me to do?

331
00:30:48,225 --> 00:30:51,905
I need to get the rust off the floor
Where did you guys put the matt knife?

332
00:30:52,866 --> 00:30:55,866
I was opening boxes yesterday
It's gotta be in there somewhere

333
00:30:57,346 --> 00:30:58,346
I don't understand you

334
00:30:59,505 --> 00:31:01,586
- Honestly, I don't
- What's going on here?

335
00:31:02,826 --> 00:31:03,907
Everything's fine. Great

336
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:06,346
Couldn't be better, right mom? Fantastic!

337
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:09,386
Maybe I'll go unpack something

338
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:19,666
What's up?

339
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:23,827
You said you weren't going to ask me why

340
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,546
What?

341
00:31:27,347 --> 00:31:28,826
Why I'm staying

342
00:31:31,107 --> 00:31:31,986
And?

343
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:34,667
I wanted you to ask me

344
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:40,668
My dad's kind of sick

345
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:44,427
He has this disease

346
00:31:46,267 --> 00:31:48,907
It's called "Haughtington's Syndrome"

347
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:54,667
Just before Paul was
born it got really bad

348
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:57,867
He was having attacks

349
00:31:58,548 --> 00:31:59,788
But you can't imagine...

350
00:32:01,148 --> 00:32:03,827
...what it must be like to be
afraid of your own father

351
00:32:07,068 --> 00:32:09,388
But he's okay now

352
00:32:10,749 --> 00:32:12,429
The treatment took

353
00:32:12,907 --> 00:32:15,589
He's been fine for years until now

354
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:17,908
Until now?

355
00:32:20,628 --> 00:32:21,789
He's not doing so good

356
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,949
And there's definitely
something wrong with Paul

357
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:30,189
He's woken up with bruises twice now

358
00:32:31,668 --> 00:32:32,189
Hold on

359
00:32:33,749 --> 00:32:35,869
- You don't think?
- I don't think anything

360
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:39,910
He's acting weird and he barely speaks

361
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:46,069
Sometimes I think it's that house

362
00:33:39,031 --> 00:33:41,232
You know, this thing is much
more complicated than it looks

363
00:33:42,832 --> 00:33:43,551
Where's Paul?

364
00:33:44,912 --> 00:33:47,633
Grandfather came to talk to him
They're upstairs

365
00:33:59,272 --> 00:34:01,671
- I'm a Mothers worry
- Don't worry

366
00:34:02,552 --> 00:34:03,592
Regina

367
00:34:03,832 --> 00:34:05,913
I was beginning to think
I wouldn't get to see you

368
00:34:06,151 --> 00:34:06,953
Hi, grandpa

369
00:34:07,393 --> 00:34:10,033
- You're going to catch a cold
- Dry off, hon

370
00:34:10,912 --> 00:34:13,073
Try and get him to stay for dinner

371
00:34:14,673 --> 00:34:15,473
Thanks again

372
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:20,192
How are you?

373
00:34:21,034 --> 00:34:22,473
I'm good. And Paul?

374
00:34:22,713 --> 00:34:23,753
He's fine

375
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:26,313
I'm sure this is no big deal

376
00:34:26,753 --> 00:34:27,953
The change of houses,

377
00:34:28,554 --> 00:34:30,394
habits, environment

378
00:34:32,393 --> 00:34:34,393
But he's never been
afraid of the dark before

379
00:34:35,954 --> 00:34:39,394
I don't think that Paul's fear of
darkness is your biggest concern

380
00:34:41,754 --> 00:34:43,113
Why would he hurt himself?

381
00:34:44,194 --> 00:34:45,913
He's just trying to call attention

382
00:34:47,195 --> 00:34:48,913
But Dad's been strange too

383
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:51,474
He's worse

384
00:34:52,914 --> 00:34:53,914
He's aggressive

385
00:34:54,155 --> 00:34:56,475
- Like he used to be
- That's nonsense, Regina

386
00:34:57,755 --> 00:35:00,635
I know what you all went through
And I know it wasn't easy

387
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:02,434
But your father

388
00:35:02,674 --> 00:35:03,955
is under control now

389
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,914
You need to stop worrying
Nothing is going to happen

390
00:35:07,634 --> 00:35:09,555
- All right, dear?
- Thanks, grandpa

391
00:35:10,515 --> 00:35:11,475
And now, I'm off

392
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,479
He says we shouldn't worry

393
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:51,999
Kids do strange things sometimes

394
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:54,839
We have to find a place
to hang that picture

395
00:36:56,638 --> 00:36:57,958
I don't know

396
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,918
Mark, please... we're talking

397
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,199
about our children

398
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:32,160
They're going through a rough time

399
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,320
Reggie...

400
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:35,880
...she's at a difficult age

401
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,280
Maybe we're not being
understanding enough with her

402
00:37:39,441 --> 00:37:40,360
And what about me?

403
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,520
Who's being understanding with me?

404
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,001
- What are you talking about?
- Come on, please

405
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,960
You don't think

406
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,600
I hear the little secret conversations
that go on behind my back?

407
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:53,960
You're losing it

408
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,881
Right! Exactly! That's exactly
the attitude I'm talking about

409
00:37:58,241 --> 00:37:59,040
Thank you

410
00:37:59,521 --> 00:38:01,161
I know where they get it from now

411
00:38:45,843 --> 00:38:48,363
Mark, please, calm down

412
00:38:52,162 --> 00:38:53,802
Did you take your medication?

413
00:39:14,604 --> 00:39:15,483
Mark!

414
00:39:33,924 --> 00:39:34,445
Mark?

415
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:50,165
Mark!

416
00:39:51,245 --> 00:39:52,405
Regina!

417
00:39:57,446 --> 00:39:58,286
Mom?

418
00:40:02,404 --> 00:40:03,045
Reggie, quickly!

419
00:40:03,326 --> 00:40:04,325
Come over here

420
00:40:04,685 --> 00:40:05,845
I'm feeling kinda woozy

421
00:40:06,846 --> 00:40:08,406
Slow breaths, okay?

422
00:40:08,805 --> 00:40:10,445
Hold it I have to get the alcohol

423
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,285
Not now!

424
00:40:21,405 --> 00:40:22,046
Mom!

425
00:40:35,126 --> 00:40:35,887
Mom!

426
00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:41,647
Mom!

427
00:40:52,288 --> 00:40:53,527
Where's the fuse box?

428
00:40:55,368 --> 00:40:56,487
In the laundry room

429
00:41:18,928 --> 00:41:19,808
Reggie!

430
00:41:20,048 --> 00:41:20,768
Paul?

431
00:41:30,528 --> 00:41:32,888
Paul, what's the matter? Let me in

432
00:41:40,808 --> 00:41:41,888
They won't let me

433
00:41:42,448 --> 00:41:44,810
- There's someone here
- Paul, let me in

434
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:46,609
I can't

435
00:41:48,129 --> 00:41:49,528
- Paul!
- Dad!

436
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:50,570
Shut up!

437
00:41:51,569 --> 00:41:52,649
You're scaring him!

438
00:41:56,129 --> 00:41:57,209
I said, stop it! Dad!

439
00:41:57,929 --> 00:41:58,809
Open this door right now!

440
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,329
Mom!

441
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,250
- Stop it!
- Shut up!

442
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:10,010
Let me go!

443
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:11,569
Stop!

444
00:42:22,171 --> 00:42:24,891
Paul, honey, come here. It's okay

445
00:42:25,371 --> 00:42:26,210
It's okay

446
00:42:27,091 --> 00:42:27,971
It's okay

447
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:33,371
I don't know

448
00:42:35,091 --> 00:42:37,731
I got scared
We couldn't open the door

449
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:41,491
Baby,

450
00:42:41,731 --> 00:42:44,012
- Are you all right?
- What's wrong with you?

451
00:43:11,412 --> 00:43:14,333
I'm here now. It's okay. It's all over

452
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:17,132
It's not all over

453
00:43:17,892 --> 00:43:20,653
They never go away. They only hide

454
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:25,053
Who? What are you talking about?

455
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,612
The kids...

456
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:29,853
What kids?

457
00:43:30,893 --> 00:43:33,812
The ones in my room
They wouldn't let me out

458
00:43:34,734 --> 00:43:37,733
They hate me. They say I'm an impostor

459
00:43:40,693 --> 00:43:41,493
Paul...

460
00:43:43,214 --> 00:43:44,773
...there's no one else here

461
00:43:46,734 --> 00:43:47,973
Just you and me...

462
00:43:48,813 --> 00:43:50,054
...and mom and dad

463
00:43:52,174 --> 00:43:53,453
Those kids don't exist

464
00:43:54,534 --> 00:43:55,973
You're imagining them

465
00:43:56,974 --> 00:43:59,814
Yes they do. They come out when it's dark

466
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,454
They live in the dark

467
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,373
Didn't you hear them?

468
00:44:06,654 --> 00:44:07,694
Didn't you?

469
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:25,854
- Hello
- Carlos?

470
00:44:26,335 --> 00:44:29,295
- Reggie, is it late?
- I know, I know. I'm sorry

471
00:44:30,455 --> 00:44:31,775
I need your help

472
00:44:32,215 --> 00:44:33,295
What's wrong?

473
00:44:34,376 --> 00:44:35,415
It's this house

474
00:45:02,896 --> 00:45:04,737
Nobody has ever lived
in your house before

475
00:45:05,696 --> 00:45:06,896
The guy who sold the
house to your father...

476
00:45:07,577 --> 00:45:08,936
...doesn't even exist

477
00:45:10,817 --> 00:45:13,337
Neither does the real
estate agent, or the lawyer

478
00:45:14,177 --> 00:45:17,536
And the phone number that's on the
contract, has never been in service

479
00:45:18,417 --> 00:45:21,177
So there's nothing We can check?

480
00:45:22,336 --> 00:45:25,856
Maybe... I found some
information about the architect

481
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:37,416
Excellent

482
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:39,538
Wanna help me?

483
00:45:42,578 --> 00:45:43,219
Where's Regina?

484
00:45:43,457 --> 00:45:45,538
She left at the crack of dawn
I don't know

485
00:46:09,698 --> 00:46:10,899
There's no one here

486
00:46:21,259 --> 00:46:22,579
Hey, I've seen that guy before

487
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:28,339
He was standing outside my house...

488
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,099
...the other night, when it was raining

489
00:46:32,618 --> 00:46:34,500
I'm sure it's him

490
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:38,500
Come on

491
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,420
You shouldn't have come

492
00:47:02,941 --> 00:47:05,780
- You designed the house, right?
- I just drew the plans according...

493
00:47:06,022 --> 00:47:08,260
...to the measurements they gave me

494
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,380
They?

495
00:47:10,502 --> 00:47:11,621
They who?

496
00:47:12,022 --> 00:47:13,542
I never saw anyone

497
00:47:16,181 --> 00:47:18,341
Everything was taken care
of through an intermediary

498
00:47:20,261 --> 00:47:22,061
All I had to do was draw...

499
00:47:22,661 --> 00:47:23,861
...and keep quiet

500
00:47:25,902 --> 00:47:28,262
That was the one thing they insisted on

501
00:47:30,621 --> 00:47:32,662
But that wasn't the strange part

502
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:39,542
We've got to talk

503
00:47:41,341 --> 00:47:44,782
Oh, yes. We've got to talk, about
that thing you hung up there

504
00:47:45,422 --> 00:47:46,461
It's hideous

505
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,742
What are you talking about?
You told me to hang it there

506
00:47:49,222 --> 00:47:49,942
What?

507
00:47:50,582 --> 00:47:51,383
Last night

508
00:47:51,623 --> 00:47:52,502
Right here

509
00:47:55,022 --> 00:47:55,942
Honey,

510
00:47:56,662 --> 00:47:58,542
- That is not the problem
- Oh, no?

511
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:00,143
Then what is the problem?

512
00:48:01,222 --> 00:48:02,263
The larvae...

513
00:48:02,662 --> 00:48:03,383
The what?

514
00:48:03,743 --> 00:48:04,782
The larvae

515
00:48:06,102 --> 00:48:07,223
They're everywhere

516
00:48:07,502 --> 00:48:08,463
In the walls

517
00:48:12,023 --> 00:48:13,903
I hear them whisper

518
00:48:16,823 --> 00:48:18,343
They talk about us

519
00:48:27,624 --> 00:48:29,024
We've got to do something

520
00:48:37,984 --> 00:48:39,104
It was the design

521
00:48:40,705 --> 00:48:42,184
The shape of the house

522
00:48:43,943 --> 00:48:45,624
In some parts of the world,

523
00:48:45,944 --> 00:48:48,304
a similar form is used

524
00:48:48,584 --> 00:48:50,024
in the design and
construction of the temples,

525
00:48:50,584 --> 00:48:53,785
or other types of occult architecture

526
00:48:54,864 --> 00:48:58,065
Something about giving
birth to spiritual energy,

527
00:48:58,305 --> 00:48:59,345
or entities

528
00:49:01,184 --> 00:49:02,824
It's been so many years

529
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,545
But I didn't like it

530
00:49:07,305 --> 00:49:10,024
- Reggie, I think we'd better get going
- No, just wait

531
00:49:11,905 --> 00:49:12,945
And then...

532
00:49:14,145 --> 00:49:15,665
...the thing with the kids happened

533
00:49:38,146 --> 00:49:39,346
What are you planning to do?

534
00:49:45,386 --> 00:49:46,267
Find them

535
00:49:48,266 --> 00:49:50,787
They must have their nest
underneath this house somewhere

536
00:49:52,667 --> 00:49:54,228
And I'm going to find it

537
00:50:14,547 --> 00:50:15,667
Seven children

538
00:50:23,947 --> 00:50:25,828
They never found them

539
00:50:30,669 --> 00:50:32,268
Except one

540
00:50:37,629 --> 00:50:39,068
When the police questioned him,

541
00:50:39,949 --> 00:50:42,109
what he told them didn't make any sense...

542
00:50:44,949 --> 00:50:48,229
...it was some crazy story about a round house

543
00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:49,948
Just dark

544
00:50:51,429 --> 00:50:52,628
So dark

545
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,148
I've spent years
obsessed with this story

546
00:50:59,269 --> 00:51:00,308
Prowling

547
00:51:00,549 --> 00:51:01,669
around the house

548
00:51:03,189 --> 00:51:04,789
It's always been empty

549
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:06,789
And then suddenly,

550
00:51:07,029 --> 00:51:08,549
one day, I find that a family's

551
00:51:08,789 --> 00:51:10,349
living there

552
00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:13,470
With a kid. For the first time

553
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:14,830
in 40 years

554
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:17,269
Why now?

555
00:51:17,509 --> 00:51:19,430
So why haven't you called the police?

556
00:51:19,909 --> 00:51:21,310
And tell them what?

557
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,950
You think they'll listen
to the crazy ramblings

558
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:26,430
of some old fart with
one foot in the grave?

559
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:28,831
- You could have told somebody
- Oh, yes...

560
00:51:29,071 --> 00:51:30,190
I could have

561
00:51:31,551 --> 00:51:32,590
But I didn't...

562
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:34,390
...you want to know why?

563
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:36,351
Because I was scared

564
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:39,950
What are you talking about?

565
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:44,790
Please go

566
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:46,871
That's all I know

567
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:49,030
Thank you for sharing your theories...

568
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:50,951
...Mr. Villalobos

569
00:51:51,231 --> 00:51:52,190
My phone number

570
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:56,312
In case you remember something

571
00:51:57,191 --> 00:51:58,310
Get your brother

572
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,432
- Out of the house
- Why?

573
00:52:00,912 --> 00:52:02,031
Get him out

574
00:52:46,193 --> 00:52:47,072
Mom!

575
00:52:48,073 --> 00:52:49,514
It's okay

576
00:52:52,873 --> 00:52:55,833
It's okay He had another
fit, but it's okay now

577
00:52:56,714 --> 00:53:00,073
- Let's go
- No You're not driving like this

578
00:53:00,554 --> 00:53:02,433
Carlos, can you take them
to the hospital, please?

579
00:53:03,154 --> 00:53:03,834
Well, what about you?

580
00:53:04,073 --> 00:53:05,953
I'm staying. There's
something I have to do here

581
00:53:07,233 --> 00:53:08,114
Reggie

582
00:53:08,395 --> 00:53:09,594
Carlos, please

583
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:11,593
Just go

584
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,481
Hello?

585
00:56:20,161 --> 00:56:21,042
<i>Hello</i>

586
00:56:28,361 --> 00:56:30,801
<i>We're watching you, bitch</i>

587
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:40,161
What the fuck do you want?

588
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,801
<I>Well, I just wanted to tell
you your father will be fine...

589
00:56:45,482 --> 00:56:46,882
<i>...if that's all right with you</i>

590
00:56:47,122 --> 00:56:48,002
Mom...

591
00:56:49,802 --> 00:56:51,802
I'm sorry I thought
you were someone else

592
00:56:53,242 --> 00:56:55,361
<i>Well, I guess we've
all been through a lot</i>

593
00:56:55,682 --> 00:56:59,601
<i>Seems the problem was the tranquilizer
I gave him after he cut himself</i>

594
00:56:59,922 --> 00:57:02,962
<i>It reacted badly with the Haloperidol
I'm a nurse...I should have known...</i>

595
00:57:03,202 --> 00:57:05,562
I don't think that's the problem

596
00:57:06,883 --> 00:57:07,802
We need to talk

597
00:57:08,043 --> 00:57:11,202
<i>They're keeping him under
observation for a couple of days...</i>

598
00:57:14,203 --> 00:57:15,082
Mom?

599
00:57:17,283 --> 00:57:18,122
Mom?

600
00:59:47,048 --> 00:59:47,847
"Ouroboros"

601
00:59:48,808 --> 00:59:50,448
It's an old occult symbol

602
00:59:51,048 --> 00:59:52,248
It means darkness...

603
00:59:52,527 --> 00:59:54,448
...the return to the beginning...

604
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,569
- ...chaos
- What's going on in my house?

605
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:42,531
What the hell is this?

606
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:49,090
It's a ritual

607
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:53,170
"Take the breath

608
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:55,650
and the love out of seven children

609
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:58,850
And close the circle with their blood

610
01:00:59,851 --> 01:01:01,570
when morning turns to night"

611
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:09,051
The old man was right

612
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:24,412
Seven children's throats cut

613
01:01:25,971 --> 01:01:27,651
by someone who loves them

614
01:01:32,573 --> 01:01:34,372
When morning turns to night

615
01:01:45,893 --> 01:01:47,413
The eclipse

616
01:01:48,892 --> 01:01:49,933
It's tomorrow

617
01:01:50,693 --> 01:01:52,453
It only happens every 40 years

618
01:01:56,172 --> 01:01:57,533
The last time they tried
it, something went wrong

619
01:01:58,573 --> 01:02:00,174
One of the kids escaped

620
01:02:00,453 --> 01:02:02,652
They had to be seven,
but they only got six

621
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:04,534
It's going to happen again

622
01:02:09,373 --> 01:02:10,413
With Paul

623
01:02:11,693 --> 01:02:12,654
Reggie,

624
01:02:13,374 --> 01:02:15,093
no one's going to do anything to Paul

625
01:02:16,053 --> 01:02:17,612
My dad is sick

626
01:02:18,253 --> 01:02:20,534
Sometimes he doesn't
even know what he's doing

627
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:27,494
- Reggie, you should hear yourself?
- Mom,

628
01:02:27,694 --> 01:02:29,014
- It's the house
- You're not!

629
01:02:31,134 --> 01:02:32,734
Dad would never hurt us

630
01:02:33,213 --> 01:02:35,415
What you're saying is
terrible... it's obscene

631
01:02:37,774 --> 01:02:41,095
Is that too hard for you to
accept that your father and I?

632
01:02:41,335 --> 01:02:42,053
Mom! Please!

633
01:02:42,774 --> 01:02:44,135
Dad is sick!

634
01:02:49,175 --> 01:02:50,615
And the stuff that's
been going on, it all fits

635
01:02:52,055 --> 01:02:53,254
The eclipse is tomorrow

636
01:02:53,494 --> 01:02:54,694
Just don't go back to that house, please

637
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,855
We'll do whatever your grandfather says,

638
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:58,975
since he's your father's doctor, not you

639
01:03:51,017 --> 01:03:52,337
- Hello
- Grandpa,

640
01:03:53,137 --> 01:03:55,576
- It's Regina
- Regina, come up

641
01:04:12,138 --> 01:04:13,178
It's Villalobos

642
01:04:13,817 --> 01:04:17,017
Listen, I've found one of the
papers the guy sent me, you know...

643
01:04:17,257 --> 01:04:19,098
...the intermediary

644
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:20,858
There was a letterhead...

645
01:04:21,938 --> 01:04:22,899
...an address

646
01:04:23,538 --> 01:04:25,819
And I'm going over
there and you should too

647
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:34,742
Here, this will make you feel better

648
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,301
You have to believe me

649
01:05:38,861 --> 01:05:40,060
I don't know what to do

650
01:05:41,541 --> 01:05:43,341
I believe you, Regina

651
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:45,261
It's just that this

652
01:05:46,701 --> 01:05:48,182
is all too strange

653
01:05:48,502 --> 01:05:49,461
I don't know

654
01:05:50,902 --> 01:05:52,941
I don't understand a lot of
what you've been telling me

655
01:05:53,461 --> 01:05:54,662
You have to help me

656
01:05:56,101 --> 01:05:58,782
- You're a doctor, they'll listen to you
- Okay

657
01:05:59,102 --> 01:06:00,221
I don't want you to worry

658
01:06:00,622 --> 01:06:01,942
I'm going to call the hospital

659
01:06:04,342 --> 01:06:05,142
Please!

660
01:06:07,742 --> 01:06:09,982
Don't let them go back to the house

661
01:06:12,021 --> 01:06:13,062
They won't go back, trust me

662
01:06:26,703 --> 01:06:29,862
<i>- Reggie, listen... it's the old man, Villalobos</i>

663
01:06:30,703 --> 01:06:33,543
<i>He found the address of the guy
who was sending him instructions</i>

664
01:06:33,783 --> 01:06:35,663
<i>He said he was going over there</i>

665
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:37,742
Wait I want to come with you

666
01:06:38,183 --> 01:06:41,624
<i>It's one of those buildings
behind the park... number 17</i>

667
01:06:43,023 --> 01:06:44,463
<i>- What?
- Reggie...</i>

668
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:46,304
<i>...number 17...</i>

669
01:06:47,023 --> 01:06:48,863
Number 17?

670
01:06:50,063 --> 01:06:51,984
<i>I'll wait for you out in front...</i>

671
01:06:52,983 --> 01:06:56,303
<i>- But I'm here
- Reggie, wait...</i>

672
01:07:13,744 --> 01:07:14,784
Grandpa

673
01:08:54,467 --> 01:08:55,427
Regina

674
01:08:57,268 --> 01:08:58,387
You should have been

675
01:08:58,628 --> 01:08:59,668
in your house

676
01:09:01,108 --> 01:09:02,229
With your family because
they are in the house

677
01:09:06,548 --> 01:09:08,028
What are you doing in the dark?

678
01:09:19,988 --> 01:09:21,188
Where's Reggie?

679
01:09:23,749 --> 01:09:24,709
I don't know

680
01:09:25,549 --> 01:09:26,589
She hasn't called

681
01:09:28,068 --> 01:09:29,549
I expected her to call

682
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:30,749
Let her be

683
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:34,908
You know how she's been lately

684
01:09:48,591 --> 01:09:51,270
In the beginning it was just science

685
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:54,390
You begin studying minds

686
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:55,750
of children

687
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:57,990
How their fears work

688
01:10:00,831 --> 01:10:03,110
A fear shared by all children

689
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:06,991
In all times and in all cultures

690
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:09,270
An irrational fear:

691
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:11,511
The fear of the dark

692
01:10:19,111 --> 01:10:20,311
I think I might take a nap

693
01:10:22,072 --> 01:10:23,030
I'm exhausted

694
01:10:25,352 --> 01:10:27,390
Sounds like a good idea

695
01:10:40,671 --> 01:10:42,791
And now, we are almost ready

696
01:10:46,672 --> 01:10:48,311
After so many years

697
01:10:48,991 --> 01:10:50,472
What are you talking about?

698
01:10:52,911 --> 01:10:54,671
About darkness, my dear,

699
01:10:55,312 --> 01:10:56,352
the true darkness

700
01:10:57,831 --> 01:11:00,551
A kind of evil in its greatest form

701
01:11:01,713 --> 01:11:02,673
Pure...

702
01:11:04,073 --> 01:11:05,272
...and alive

703
01:11:14,352 --> 01:11:15,313
And now,

704
01:11:17,432 --> 01:11:19,233
the moment has arrived

705
01:11:23,633 --> 01:11:24,594
Finally...

706
01:11:26,752 --> 01:11:27,554
...it will be born

707
01:11:34,074 --> 01:11:34,754
Dirty...

708
01:11:35,514 --> 01:11:36,714
...and perverted

709
01:11:41,715 --> 01:11:42,754
Don't try so hard,

710
01:11:42,994 --> 01:11:44,193
Regina

711
01:11:45,354 --> 01:11:46,834
The game has already begun

712
01:11:59,395 --> 01:12:01,314
<i>The countdown has already begun</i>

713
01:12:02,074 --> 01:12:05,074
<i>We're getting closer to the moment
When the sun and the moon aligned</i>

714
01:12:05,515 --> 01:12:07,874
<i>submerges for a few moments in darkness</i>

715
01:12:10,555 --> 01:12:11,595
Why?

716
01:12:12,634 --> 01:12:13,676
Why?

717
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:16,315
Because it's a question

718
01:12:16,555 --> 01:12:17,515
of faith

719
01:12:18,235 --> 01:12:19,916
We are our origin

720
01:12:20,395 --> 01:12:22,155
And our origin is that

721
01:12:23,435 --> 01:12:25,035
Evil, disorder

722
01:12:26,715 --> 01:12:28,675
We discovered the spell

723
01:12:28,915 --> 01:12:29,956
to get it back

724
01:12:32,236 --> 01:12:33,196
The egg temple

725
01:12:37,676 --> 01:12:40,235
and seven children's throats cut

726
01:12:40,595 --> 01:12:42,235
by loving hands

727
01:12:45,796 --> 01:12:47,476
And the eclipse of course

728
01:13:18,997 --> 01:13:20,558
It's just an experiment

729
01:13:20,798 --> 01:13:21,757
I'm a doctor

730
01:13:22,678 --> 01:13:24,717
Do you know what the ancients called it?

731
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:27,597
"The great liar"

732
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:03,119
- Where's Regina?
- She's here. Come in

733
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,919
Thank goodness you came

734
01:14:22,879 --> 01:14:24,240
I didn't know what to do

735
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,280
Hey what's going on here?

736
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,840
Do you know what's going on here?

737
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,401
What's going on is
that you have fucked up

738
01:15:28,481 --> 01:15:32,002
I don't know why everyone is
trying to ruin this moment for me

739
01:15:37,323 --> 01:15:40,242
Once begun no one can stop it

740
01:15:41,322 --> 01:15:43,082
There is no way back

741
01:16:13,364 --> 01:16:14,764
Everything was perfect

742
01:16:17,844 --> 01:16:18,804
We were seven

743
01:16:20,164 --> 01:16:21,525
We had built the temple

744
01:16:23,763 --> 01:16:24,963
And waited for the eclipse

745
01:16:28,404 --> 01:16:29,924
Each one with his child

746
01:16:34,004 --> 01:16:36,725
But at the last minute it fell apart

747
01:16:38,164 --> 01:16:39,685
I'm the only one left

748
01:16:41,045 --> 01:16:43,765
The only one who has
survived all these years

749
01:16:46,204 --> 01:16:47,764
Ironic, isn't it?

750
01:16:50,725 --> 01:16:51,846
Because it was my fault

751
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:57,525
I had to let my son escape

752
01:17:02,405 --> 01:17:03,525
I couldn't do it

753
01:17:09,205 --> 01:17:10,645
Mom!

754
01:17:12,485 --> 01:17:13,526
Yes, Paul

755
01:17:14,366 --> 01:17:16,086
Can I have a glass of water?

756
01:17:20,726 --> 01:17:21,526
Mom

757
01:17:42,047 --> 01:17:43,166
Please, just go away

758
01:17:55,967 --> 01:17:56,847
You loved him

759
01:18:00,327 --> 01:18:01,367
Let me go

760
01:18:02,647 --> 01:18:04,049
We can still stop it

761
01:18:06,407 --> 01:18:08,927
The rules of the game are very clear

762
01:18:11,248 --> 01:18:13,688
Seven children's throats cut

763
01:18:14,529 --> 01:18:16,488
by hands which love them

764
01:18:17,929 --> 01:18:19,129
Go away?

765
01:18:20,649 --> 01:18:22,448
You want me to go away

766
01:18:23,249 --> 01:18:24,728
What the hell are you talking about?

767
01:18:26,608 --> 01:18:27,808
This is my house

768
01:18:33,328 --> 01:18:35,328
Open the fucking door!

769
01:18:36,848 --> 01:18:38,168
Now!

770
01:18:41,169 --> 01:18:42,289
The last minute

771
01:18:43,009 --> 01:18:45,009
I realized it wouldn't work,

772
01:18:47,929 --> 01:18:49,409
because, honestly,

773
01:18:51,249 --> 01:18:52,370
I didn't love him

774
01:19:00,889 --> 01:19:01,770
Mark?

775
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:04,730
Please, just go away

776
01:19:14,170 --> 01:19:16,689
Paul doesn't have anything to do with this

777
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:23,970
You haven't understood
anything, have you?

778
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:26,211
It's not Paul,

779
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:27,771
you idiot

780
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:30,451
It's your father

781
01:19:31,771 --> 01:19:32,411
What?

782
01:19:34,131 --> 01:19:35,731
It has to be the same child

783
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:38,931
Mark, just leave us alone

784
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:41,010
Open this fucking door!

785
01:19:41,851 --> 01:19:42,811
Mark!

786
01:19:46,691 --> 01:19:47,731
Mark, you're sick

787
01:19:48,491 --> 01:19:50,772
You're not taking your
medicine, that's why you're sick

788
01:19:51,531 --> 01:19:52,492
No!

789
01:19:53,171 --> 01:19:54,211
Liar! That's a lie!

790
01:20:01,411 --> 01:20:02,972
Please, Mark, go

791
01:20:03,212 --> 01:20:04,652
- Can't you see you're sick?
- Mom

792
01:20:05,252 --> 01:20:06,731
It wasn't Dad

793
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:10,373
He didn't hit me

794
01:20:12,373 --> 01:20:13,332
It's impossible

795
01:20:15,892 --> 01:20:17,012
It'll never happen

796
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:23,453
Darkness is very wise

797
01:20:25,853 --> 01:20:27,853
Knows very well what a mother...

798
01:20:28,293 --> 01:20:30,573
...is capable of doing to protect her young

799
01:21:09,454 --> 01:21:10,974
Mark, enough!

800
01:21:22,055 --> 01:21:23,174
This is my toy

801
01:21:24,975 --> 01:21:26,175
A snake,

802
01:21:26,494 --> 01:21:28,335
and something about to be born

803
01:21:29,975 --> 01:21:31,695
It sounds familiar, doesn't it?

804
01:21:38,295 --> 01:21:39,496
It'll never happen

805
01:21:40,775 --> 01:21:42,055
I saw it in the book

806
01:21:43,455 --> 01:21:45,176
The throat has

807
01:21:45,416 --> 01:21:46,376
to be cut

808
01:21:49,175 --> 01:21:52,095
and my mother wouldn't
do that. It's impossible

809
01:21:52,895 --> 01:21:54,256
Have faith, Regina

810
01:21:56,617 --> 01:21:58,736
Darkness knows a great deal

811
01:22:03,576 --> 01:22:06,095
Okay Here's my medication

812
01:22:07,336 --> 01:22:08,097
Mark

813
01:22:09,617 --> 01:22:10,656
What are you doing?

814
01:22:16,377 --> 01:22:18,136
Here are the goddamn pills

815
01:22:18,777 --> 01:22:20,097
Daddy

816
01:22:23,057 --> 01:22:25,057
I'm so sorry

817
01:22:28,457 --> 01:22:29,577
I love you

818
01:22:31,816 --> 01:22:32,777
I love you

819
01:22:34,297 --> 01:22:35,057
So much

820
01:22:52,858 --> 01:22:53,498
Run

821
01:22:55,658 --> 01:22:56,978
You don't have much time

822
01:22:58,457 --> 01:22:59,417
Run!

823
01:23:05,818 --> 01:23:07,018
It's your turn

824
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:28,819
Answer me!

825
01:23:32,099 --> 01:23:34,339
Pills! Freak pills

826
01:23:34,979 --> 01:23:36,339
You want me to take pills

827
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:44,300
What's going on?

828
01:24:29,142 --> 01:24:29,661
Paul,

829
01:24:30,902 --> 01:24:33,422
go get a pen I've got to open
him up or he's going to die

830
01:24:34,781 --> 01:24:35,262
Go!

831
01:24:57,703 --> 01:24:58,263
Paul, hurry!

832
01:25:21,623 --> 01:25:23,623
Paul, you should just go up
to your room and don't look

833
01:25:26,262 --> 01:25:27,384
Just go, now!

834
01:26:07,865 --> 01:26:08,984
Mom, no!

835
01:26:09,906 --> 01:26:11,106
What are you doing?

836
01:26:11,345 --> 01:26:13,546
He needs air I gotta open his throat

837
01:26:13,824 --> 01:26:15,305
Get out of my way! Don't you
understand that's what it wants?

838
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:16,664
Your father is dying!

839
01:26:21,706 --> 01:26:23,425
I gotta open his throat, let him breathe

840
01:26:36,386 --> 01:26:38,506
I can't do it

841
01:26:39,147 --> 01:26:40,186
I can't do it

842
01:26:45,147 --> 01:26:47,667
Give it to me I'll do it
Just tell me what to do

843
01:27:03,346 --> 01:27:05,867
A clean cut just under the Adam's apple

844
01:27:09,948 --> 01:27:10,908
Quickly!

845
01:27:16,707 --> 01:27:17,268
Mom!

846
01:27:19,707 --> 01:27:20,987
Now get the tube

847
01:27:21,588 --> 01:27:23,228
Put it in his throat

848
01:27:26,147 --> 01:27:28,188
What tube? What tube?

849
01:27:28,547 --> 01:27:30,348
- It's here
- Mom!

850
01:27:39,388 --> 01:27:40,269
Where is it?

851
01:27:41,068 --> 01:27:42,708
Mom!

852
01:27:43,348 --> 01:27:44,068
Where?

853
01:27:46,068 --> 01:27:46,867
Mom!

854
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:48,229
It's too late

855
01:27:49,429 --> 01:27:50,348
Mom!

856
01:28:07,909 --> 01:28:09,030
It's over

857
01:28:10,269 --> 01:28:11,589
The seventh child...

858
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:13,870
...is dead

859
01:28:19,269 --> 01:28:20,149
Where's

860
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:23,350
Regina?

861
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:26,869
In her house

862
01:28:33,229 --> 01:28:34,350
In hell

863
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:39,591
Where's the flashlight?

864
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:41,630
Where is it?

865
01:28:45,711 --> 01:28:48,230
Mom, we have to get out
of here. Where's Paul?

866
01:28:50,071 --> 01:28:51,951
- Where is he? Where is he?
- Upstairs

867
01:29:14,272 --> 01:29:15,951
- Regina!
- Paul!

868
01:29:18,752 --> 01:29:19,872
I'm scared!

869
01:29:25,752 --> 01:29:26,952
Paul, I'm coming

870
01:29:37,112 --> 01:29:38,032
Regina!

871
01:29:42,593 --> 01:29:44,113
Come with me

872
01:29:58,874 --> 01:29:59,833
It's tricking us It's trying to fool us

873
01:30:00,713 --> 01:30:02,033
It's a liar

874
01:30:02,394 --> 01:30:04,313
We're gonna get out of here right now

875
01:30:08,474 --> 01:30:09,354
Mom?

876
01:30:11,994 --> 01:30:13,033
Don't be afraid

877
01:30:14,434 --> 01:30:15,553
We can end this

878
01:30:16,394 --> 01:30:18,154
It's just a question of not being afraid

879
01:30:22,914 --> 01:30:25,515
- He's dead
- No, he's not

880
01:30:27,674 --> 01:30:29,875
I want Daddy back, Mommy

881
01:30:31,555 --> 01:30:32,754
We can save him

882
01:30:34,355 --> 01:30:36,555
You just have to turn off the burners

883
01:30:37,675 --> 01:30:40,194
It's the only way to fight the darkness

884
01:30:41,274 --> 01:30:43,635
We don't have much time left

885
01:30:44,434 --> 01:30:45,555
You have to trust me, Regina

886
01:30:46,155 --> 01:30:47,116
What are you saying?

887
01:30:47,555 --> 01:30:48,756
For once in your life,

888
01:30:49,555 --> 01:30:51,236
you'll just have to trust me

889
01:30:52,235 --> 01:30:52,755
No

890
01:30:53,675 --> 01:30:54,796
Turn the light off

891
01:30:55,716 --> 01:30:56,595
Turn them off

892
01:30:57,596 --> 01:30:58,475
You can save him

893
01:30:59,075 --> 01:31:01,036
- Please, Mom
- I don't understand

894
01:31:01,475 --> 01:31:02,436
You're a liar

895
01:31:04,916 --> 01:31:06,116
Turn it off

896
01:31:06,355 --> 01:31:07,475
You're not my mother

897
01:31:14,556 --> 01:31:15,356
Turn them off

898
01:31:18,076 --> 01:31:18,996
Do it for Dad

899
01:31:27,997 --> 01:31:28,836
Mom?

900
01:31:29,637 --> 01:31:30,517
Mom!

901
01:31:32,236 --> 01:31:33,597
Where is Mom?

902
01:31:35,036 --> 01:31:36,078
She's not here

903
01:31:36,637 --> 01:31:38,116
Don't look. We gotta get out of here

904
01:31:50,277 --> 01:31:51,478
Come on. We gotta get out of here

905
01:31:51,717 --> 01:31:52,758
Try the window

906
01:31:53,717 --> 01:31:55,518
We'll try the window

907
01:32:05,318 --> 01:32:06,277
Come on. Stand back

908
01:32:15,239 --> 01:32:17,959
Come on, we have to get
out right now! Come on, jump!

909
01:32:18,798 --> 01:32:19,758
Come on!

910
01:32:23,838 --> 01:32:26,878
- Come on
- Get in the car right now, honey

911
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,119
It's gonna be okay

912
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,479
Are we going back to the States?

913
01:32:56,559 --> 01:32:57,241
Yeah

914
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:09,080
Come on up. I want you to see something

915
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:10,720
You're gonna love it

916
01:33:15,401 --> 01:33:16,600
It's tricking us

917
01:33:16,881 --> 01:33:17,840
It's a liar

918
01:33:18,641 --> 01:33:19,680
It's over, Paul

919
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:21,960
No
