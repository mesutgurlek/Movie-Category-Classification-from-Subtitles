1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,314
<i>(man) Peter was a courageous boy,</i>

2
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:21,152
<i>but that dawn he could feel fear</i>
<i>stick to his skin like dew on leaves.</i>

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,398
<i>The fog was thick enough</i>
<i>to make him lose his way home.</i>

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,958
<i>Then he began to hear strange noises</i>
<i>coming from the depths of the forest.</i>

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,036
<i>He noticed a presence,</i>

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,473
<i>small shadows that seemed to giggle</i>
<i>as they followed in his footsteps.</i>

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,958
- <i>(boy) Who were they, Grandpa?</i>
- <i>Cruel, deformed forest dwellers,</i>

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,516
<i>haughty creatures,</i>
<i>spiteful and impudent.</i>

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,996
<i>They are the vengeful and evil goblins</i> -

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,759
<i>the little people of the night.</i>

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,079
What did they want with him?
What did Peter do to the goblins?

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,320
That's the point. Goblins don't
need to justify their cruel acts.

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,670
They are evil creatures.

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,075
But let me go on, please.

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,839
OK. I won't interrupt you any more.

16
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,428
To make a long story short,

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,836
Peter started to run and run

18
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,235
<i>and run.</i>

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,274
<i>(grunting and grumbling)</i>

20
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,112
Poor Peter remained on the ground
unconscious for a long time.

21
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,754
Finally, when he opened his eyes,

22
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,158
he saw in front of him,
just a few inches away from him...

23
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,590
A goblin?

24
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,676
<i>She was a lovely girl</i>

25
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,349
<i>with huge eyes the colour of the sea.</i>

26
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,598
<i>She looked at him kindly,</i>
<i>her expression full of love.</i>

27
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,757
<i>Peter immediately fell in love with her.</i>

28
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,795
<i>She caressed him and offered him</i>
<i>something to eat and drink.</i>

29
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,550
<i>The strange concoction</i>
<i>she offered him was delicious.</i>

30
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,357
<i>Peter ate and drank</i>
<i>without ever taking his eyes off her.</i>

31
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,756
<i>He was bewitched by that gaze,</i>

32
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,998
<i>and it was that look that deceived him.</i>

33
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,680
I bet it was a goblin in disguise.

34
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,232
Those evil creatures can transform
themselves into flesh and blood people,

35
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,432
whenever and however they want.

36
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,752
You're making a mistake, Grandpa.
You said they <i>can.</i>

37
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,839
You should have said they <i>could,</i>
or what kind of fairy tale is it?

38
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,633
They <i>can.</i> They <i>can.</i>

39
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,320
Goblins still exist.

40
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,273
Your Grandpa Seth is telling you.

41
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,314
And... how did Peter end up?

42
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,752
<i>He began to feel ill, very ill.</i>

43
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,953
<i>He was sweating chlorophyll green.</i>

44
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,913
- <i>(boy) Green?</i>
- <i>That's right.</i>

45
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,635
<i>The colour of the goblins.</i>
<i>The colour of sap.</i>

46
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,958
<i>Then she appeared to him</i>
<i>as she really was</i> -

47
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,152
<i>horrible and mocking.</i>

48
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,191
Changed into what?

49
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,073
Half man, half plant.

50
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,078
The goblins' favourite food.

51
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,034
Food? Don't tell me
they ate him, Grandpa!

52
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,833
That's exactly what happened,

53
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,238
with a voracity
that has no equal on Earth.

54
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,393
What are you doing still up, Josh?

55
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,432
Grandpa Seth was telling me a sto...

56
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,671
<i>(sighs)</i>

57
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,548
Still telling the same story, Josh?

58
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,911
I know, Mommy. I told you
it would never happen again.

59
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,476
But, you see, it's not a dream for me.

60
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,388
I see him in front of me
and he's so real.

61
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,795
He tells me stories, just like before.

62
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,789
Grandpa Seth has been gone for over
six months now. You were at the funeral.

63
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,275
I know it was very difficult for you.

64
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,269
It was also very difficult for your
father, Holly and me, his daughter.

65
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,630
He was an amazing man.

66
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,718
Grandpa Seth has remained
in all our hearts,

67
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,991
but you must banish him
from your mind.

68
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,759
- Remember what the doctor said?
- Of course.

69
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,475
Grandpa Seth is just an invention
of my subconscious.

70
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,239
That's right.

71
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,638
- But he's so real...
- That's enough. Try to go to sleep.

72
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,228
We're going on a vacation tomorrow.

73
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,514
A month in the country will do us
all good. Good night, dear.

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,434
- Good night, dear.
- Mom?

75
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,115
- Yes?
- Do goblins exist?

76
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,475
No, dear. They don't exist.

77
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,875
Now, try to go to sleep.

78
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,230
<i>(man)</i> Yeah, John. That's Nilbog,
right. Spell it? N-l-L-B-O-G.

79
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,430
We'll be gone around a month.

80
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,916
Can you take care
of that business while we're gone?

81
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,235
Yeah? That's great. OK.

82
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,920
See ya, John. All right, bye.

83
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,478
- Are the kids sleeping?
- No. They're more awake than we are.

84
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,388
They're probably excited about the trip.

85
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,398
Do you know how many people
live in Nilbog?

86
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,274
- No. How many?
- 26, including the Presents.

87
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,358
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Come on to bed.

88
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,268
Just think, we'll be living like
our ancestors did.

89
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,868
Yeah, we'll be peasants and farmers,

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,390
just like people did a century ago.

91
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,149
- Hey, what's the matter?
- I'm worried about Joshua.

92
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,078
He's still seeing Grandpa Seth.

93
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,668
When I was a kid,
I had an imaginary playmate.

94
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,360
It wasn't your dead grandfather.

95
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,429
It'll end. This trip will make him
forget about your father.

96
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,590
- Michael?
- Yeah?

97
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,518
Who are the goblins?

98
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,030
The goblins? <i>(laughs)</i>

99
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,720
<i>(tapping)</i>

100
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,832
<i>(laughter)</i>

101
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,511
- Sh! You fell! What a jerk!
- He pointed the light right at me!

102
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,428
Goblins don't exist. Goblins
don't exist. Goblins don't exist.

103
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,033
<i>(screeches)</i>

104
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,155
Elliot!
What kind of idiotic joke is this?

105
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,475
You scared the shit out of me.

106
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,955
I'm the victim of a nocturnal rapture.

107
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,311
I have to release my lowest instincts
with a woman.

108
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,590
Release your instincts in the bathroom!

109
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,191
- Are you trying to turn me into a homo?
- It wouldn't be too hard.

110
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,233
If my father discovers you here,
he'd cut off your little nuts and eat them.

111
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,476
He can't stand you!

112
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,319
And... And you?

113
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,396
I like you.

114
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,476
But my family doesn't like you.

115
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,115
They say you spend
way too much time with your friends.

116
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,800
Oh, oh, but I swear I never see them.

117
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,311
- How long is this gonna take?
- We're sick of waiting.

118
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,159
Won't you come to Tonino's,
Holly, for some pizza?

119
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,350
Hey, these are cute!

120
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,436
<i>(all complain)</i>

121
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,757
- Do you see?
- What's wrong with having friends?

122
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,677
Nothing, if you wanna
remain a virgin for life.

123
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,679
You take them to bed with you,
and I don't believe in group sex.

124
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,360
Is your family
going on vacation tomorrow?

125
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,277
- Yes.
- I'll come with you?

126
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,994
OK, I'll tell my father
you're coming with us.

127
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,076
- Where are we going?
- Nilbog.

128
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,112
A wonderful half-empty town.
It's an exchange.

129
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,075
A family from the country is coming here
and we're going to live in their house.

130
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,317
Oh, Elliot, it will be wonderful.

131
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,193
You and me, in the woods.

132
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,676
This time, we'll be able
to be together for sure.

133
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,711
And my boys?

134
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,798
If you bring them,
I never wanna see you again.

135
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,038
OK. I'm going now and I'll tell them.
I'll see you tomorrow morning?

136
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,674
- At eight on the dot.
- OK.

137
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,155
- Elliot?
- Yeah.

138
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,236
- Alone?
- Of course.

139
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,920
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

140
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,195
Finally!

141
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,679
Please don't do this, Holly.

142
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,190
We could have waited
another 15 minutes.

143
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,959
I'm sure he would've come.

144
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,038
We left at 9.30,
an hour and a half off schedule.

145
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,869
- We never saw a sign of your beau.
- Elliot's not my beau.

146
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,877
He's my boyfriend.

147
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,468
He told me last night that he loves me

148
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,160
and that he wanted to come
with my family.

149
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,909
- Evidently he preferred his friends to you.
- That's not true.

150
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,510
Yes, it is. Listen to reason.
Elliot is a good-for-nothing.

151
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,392
Stop it, both of you.

152
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,958
I have no intention of having
my vacation ruined just for this.

153
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,829
I never liked that kid. I never did.

154
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,316
I'm the one who has to like him, Dad.
Me, alone.

155
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,396
Stop it, please!

156
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,672
Joshua, start singing. Come on.
Sing that song I like so much.

157
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,634
- I don't feel like singing, Mom.
- Just sing.

158
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,116
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream

159
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,357
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
life is but a dream

160
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,995
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream

161
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,192
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
life is but a dream

162
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,357
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
life is but a dream

163
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,069
Where the hell is Nilbog?
It's not even marked on the map.

164
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,273
It's gotta be there somewhere.
Just look closer, dudes.

165
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,039
Here it is, but it's just a speck.

166
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,836
- Sure it's full of beautiful girls?
- Lots of 'em. Pretty and unattached.

167
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,712
Oh, yeah!

168
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,398
Whoo!

169
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,472
I don't feel good.

170
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,918
Stop the car, Dad. I'm sick!

171
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,919
You stuffed yourself like a pig, Joshua!

172
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,912
I'd really love to see you get sick!

173
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,508
You ate too much.

174
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,195
Dad, stop the car.

175
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,788
Joshua's ready to be eaten!

176
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,512
<i>(growling)</i>

177
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,919
- No! Don't eat me!
- Joshua!

178
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,270
Was I dreaming?

179
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,755
Who wanted to eat you, little brother?

180
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,677
Nobody.

181
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,148
We're only a few miles away, Josh.

182
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,317
Speaking of eating,
do you want some, Joshua?

183
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,795
No, thanks.

184
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,597
- Stop the car, Daddy. Stop!
- What's wrong, Josh?

185
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,350
- Do you have to throw up?
- Yes. I have to throw up.

186
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,754
- What are you doing here, Grandpa?
- What are all of <i>you</i> doing here?

187
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,917
- You have to make them go back.
- Why?

188
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,077
You're getting yourselves into big trouble.

189
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,751
This is a bad place, little one.
It even gives me the creeps.

190
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,111
Can't you tell me more, Grandpa?

191
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,040
What are you doing, Joshua?

192
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,277
So how about it?
Are you gonna give me a ride or not?

193
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,154
Get in the car, Joshua. Come on! Hurry!

194
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,030
Come on! Get in!

195
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,713
Holly!

196
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,750
Come on! Holly! Quick!

197
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,758
- That was them, right?
- Yeah, right. She just...

198
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,634
- Why didn't Holly stop them?
- I don't think this was a good idea.

199
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,799
- Shut up! I'm in charge, not her.
- Yeah, says you!

200
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,434
- There's no one here.
- It's normal.

201
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,838
It's a farming community. At this
time of night everybody goes to sleep.

202
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,554
- Where's the farm?
- Over there.

203
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,878
Now, remember, we're the farmer Waits.
We're country people.

204
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,070
- Dad?
- What, Josh?

205
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,476
I don't like this place.
Can we go home?

206
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,273
- What?
- Don't listen to him.

207
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,517
- Lead the way, Farmer Waits.
- OK.

208
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,476
Fresh air! Country air!

209
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,158
Hello.

210
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,876
- You're late.
- I'm sorry. We had a small mishap.

211
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,155
- Here are the keys.
- Um, here are ours.

212
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,430
Enjoy your stay in Nilbog.

213
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,516
Enjoy our city, too.

214
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,796
You'll enjoy our city.

215
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,514
It has some smog and it's a little noisy,

216
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,155
but our house
has all the major conveniences.

217
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,909
It's got a microwave and video.
All the other appliances.

218
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,238
- Yeah.
- A refrigerator, a bar.

219
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,909
People of few words.

220
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,235
Come on. Let's go in.

221
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,831
Joshua? You coming?

222
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,278
- Yeah, not bad!
- I'm hungry.

223
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,269
They've probably left something
behind, I'd be willing to bet.

224
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,314
Come take a look, everyone!

225
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,709
Typical country hospitality.

226
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,035
Let's dig in.

227
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,790
- <i>(father)</i> I am so hungry.
- <i>(mother)</i> Here, have some of this.

228
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,194
Here, try this. That looks good...

229
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,394
- Grandpa!
- Don't let them eat, Joshua.

230
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,479
For the love of God, don't let them eat!

231
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,240
Aren't you hungry, Joshua?

232
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,708
Most of this stuff is green.
How weird.

233
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,470
Stop them, Joshua.
You're the only one that can do it.

234
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,355
If they eat, they'll come to
the same end as Peter in the story.

235
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,869
But how can I stop them?

236
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,430
OK, you have 30 seconds
to come up with some way to stop them.

237
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,750
I must do it!

238
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,912
I must do it! I must do it!

239
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,916
No, Daddy! Please!

240
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,679
Don't hit him, Michael.
Please don't hit him!

241
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,352
Why not? It's what he deserves -
a big spanking for a little shit.

242
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,359
Joshua is not a little shit.
He's just very sensitive.

243
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,755
This smells!

244
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,435
Do you see this writing?

245
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,437
Do you know what it means?

246
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,395
Hospitality,
and you can't piss on hospitality.

247
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,035
- I won't allow it!
- What are you going to do, Daddy?

248
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,038
Tighten my belt
so I don't feel hunger pains.

249
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,469
Your sister and mother will do likewise.

250
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,716
OK, Joshua. You want to get rough?

251
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,152
You wanna show that you don't like
this house by going on hunger strike?

252
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,876
I'll accept the challenge, but when I was
your age I really did suffer from hunger.

253
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,754
We'll see who gets through this,
but I've got more practice.

254
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,314
I'll see you tomorrow.

255
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,833
<i>(explosions on television)</i>

256
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,397
I'm sick of this. Where are
the unattached horny girls, Elliot?

257
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,071
Don't be a pain in the neck, Arnold.
We just got here.

258
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,829
I'm going outside
for a breath of fresh air.

259
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,431
Hey, Arnold. If you find any twins,
don't be greedy.

260
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,350
Hey! Hey!

261
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,910
Hey!

262
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,912
Ma'am? Please stop.

263
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,111
Stop, I say.

264
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,151
Hey! Please stop!

265
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,430
Excuse me, ma'am!

266
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,993
Stop!

267
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,156
Stop, stop, I say!

268
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,710
- Who are you?
- Who are <i>you?</i>

269
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,833
- Are you one of the monsters?
- I've been called a lot of things.

270
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,315
- But not a monster.
- You're human?

271
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,000
<i>Very</i> human. You wanna see?

272
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,597
- Are you sick?
- They made me eat that stuff.

273
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,473
- I think I'm dying.
- They who?

274
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,956
- Who are you talking about?
- There they are!

275
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,718
<i>(growling)</i>

276
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,789
- Uh, what are they?
- Monsters!

277
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,357
- What do you want from me?
- Uh... Wait here.

278
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,438
Wait here. I'll take care of 'em.

279

<i>(throaty growls)</i>

280

Let me give you some advice, you dwarfs.

281
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,993
Get out of here or
you're going to be in a lot of trouble.

282
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,998
<i>(growls intensify)</i>

283
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,672
- What do we have to do?
- And remember...

284
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,633
<i>(ferocious growling)</i>

285
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,830
Did you guys hear that yell?

286
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,589
It was probably just Arnold
deflowering a Nilbog virgin.

287
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,030
No, that wasn't the scream
of a woman. That was Arnold.

288
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,029
Well, then, it was probably a girl
from Nilbog deflowering Arnold.

289
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,593
Probably!

290
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,869
<i>(cries out)</i>

291
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,511
Let's get out of here! Quick!

292
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,553
Let's hide in this house.

293
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,034
What kind of a place is this?

294
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,360
This is <i>my</i> house!

295
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,391
Allow me to introduce myself.

296
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,275
I am Creedence Leonor Gielgud,

297
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,518
of ancient druid origins.

298
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:13,033
My ancestors came from Stonehenge.

299
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:24,037
Am I mistaken or is there something
wrong with the two of you?

300
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,077
We... We need a doctor, ma'am.
Please call the nearest hospital.

301
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,636
There is no hospital in Nilbog.

302
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,276
We are used to curing ourselves.

303
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,471
Here we are.

304
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,797
This broth

305
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,150
is miraculous.

306
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,273
It contains sap from the forest.

307
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:05,919
It is a concentration of all
the vegetal properties of the earth.

308
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,870
Drink of it.

309
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,433
Children!

310
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,916
My poor children!

311
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,558
<i>(cries out)</i>

312
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,430
<i>(splutters)</i>

313
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,910
What's wrong? What's wrong with her?

314
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,191
Don't worry about her.
Drink your broth.

315
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,276
<i>(moaning)</i>

316
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,273
- I can't move! Why?
- You talk too much for me.

317
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,115
What's happening? Why can't I move?
There must be a logical reason.

318
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,754
Shut up!

319
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,795
She's... She's changing!

320
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,509
She is purifying herself.

321
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,110
Now she is one
with the vegetable world.

322
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,394
- <i>(screams)</i>
- Now she is food for my children.

323
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,314
Oh!

324
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,352
Make yourselves comfortable!

325
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,154
Dinner is ready.

326
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,956
They're eating her.
And then they're going to eat me!

327
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,196
<i>(voracious gobbling)</i>

328
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:51,589
Oh, my God!

329
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,473
I don't like this place, not one bit.

330
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,795
<i>(dance music plays)</i>

331
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,751
<i>(music stops)</i>

332
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,440
Dear Elliot Cooper.

333
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,677
Tomorrow morning
will be your final judgment.

334
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,360
Either me or your boys.

335
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,914
Take it or leave it.

336
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,996
The beautiful Holly Waits

337
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,078
or your lovely little boys.

338
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,156
Make a choice, Elliot!

339
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,108
Joshua! Joshua!

340
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,239
Mom!

341
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,112
Dad!

342
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,595
Mom! Mom!

343
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,075
What is it? What's the matter?

344
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,033
- What's wrong?
- I saw him.

345
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,630
- Who? Who did you see?
- Grandpa Seth.

346
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,793
See? It wasn't me this time!

347
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,789
It was a reflection in the mirror.

348
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:35,630
It was him. Grandpa Seth
was calling out to Joshua.

349
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,800
I'm tired of this.
Come with me, all of you.

350
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,600
So where's that damn mirror?

351
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,598
It's right... It's right there.

352
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,715
Look, there's no one other than us.

353
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,910
But he was there before.

354
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,157
It's gotta be your imagination
or a hallucination.

355
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,829
- Are you still smoking dope, Holly?
- I swore I wouldn't, Dad.

356
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,192
I want to get up early in the morning.
We're still farmers, right?

357
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,869
I am not sleeping in this room.

358
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,073
- Didn't you hear what your father said?
- I'm not sleeping here.

359
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,156
I'll sleep here.

360
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,909
- You would really do that for me?
- Sure.

361
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,349
Why not? I'm not afraid.

362
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,034
- Good night, son.
- Good night, Josh. Thank you.

363
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,833
Good night, Josh. Now, go to sleep!

364
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,036
Grandpa! Grandpa Seth! Are you here?

365
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,512
- What happened?
- You were in the wrong room!

366
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,596
Holly was sleeping there.

367
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,757
I still have to learn
the layout of this house.

368
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,791
I'm glad to see you, Grandpa.

369
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,350
Did you see?
I managed to keep them from eating.

370
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,438
Now, you have to convince them
to leave here.

371
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,835
This is an evil place.

372
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,793
It is the kingdom of the goblins.

373
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,959
But why don't <i>you</i> tell my mommy
and daddy these things?

374
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:22,154
They don't listen to me.
Your mother has never taken my advice.

375
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,317
That's why she married
that good-for-nothing.

376
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,715
<i>(crackling)</i>

377
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:32,516
The powers of evil are very strong here.
I must leave.

378
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,076
But I'll be back, Joshua.
I'll be back.

379
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,870
Grandpa? Only <i>you</i>
can do something. Only <i>you.</i>

380
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,878
Damn! There's no milk.
There's no coffee. There's nothing.

381
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,154
- Didn't anyone remember to get supplies?
- We left in too much of a hurry, Drew.

382
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,393
- Go into town. Do the shopping now.
- With what? I don't have any money.

383
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,672
- Just take it out of the group fund.
- OK.

384
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,114
Is breakfast ready, dear?

385
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,635
There's nothing in the whole house.
No eggs, no bacon.

386
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,436
There's just a lot of milk,
but it's all like this.

387
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,874
It must be a week old.

388
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,428
Good morning, Mom. Good morning, Dad.

389
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,313
- <i>(Holly)</i> What's for breakfast?
- Nothing.

390
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,352
What? I'm hungry enough
to eat a horse.

391
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,596
I've been fasting for two days.

392
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,793
Josh and I will run into town
to the general store. Right, Josh?

393
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,515
- OK.
- We won't be gone long.

394
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,118
- Hello, son.
- Hi.

395
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,470
Are you in training?

396
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,149
- No. Just goin' shopping.
- Hop in. You'll save your breath.

397
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,555
OK. Thanks.

398
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,952
- I'm Sheriff Gene Freak.
- Oh, nice to meet you, Sheriff.

399
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,674
Are you just passing through Nilbog?

400
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,394
I'm on vacation with some friends.

401
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,796
We parked our camper on the road.

402
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,196
- Are you hungry?
- Well, a little bit. Yeah.

403
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,311
<i>(eerie music drowns out voices)</i>

404
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,991
- Thanks. It's good.
- I'm sure you'll all enjoy Nilbog.

405
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,430
We're hospitable people,
especially to strangers.

406
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,316
Here's the general store.

407
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,711
Oh, where do the girls around here
go at night?

408
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,638
Ha-ha! The girls! That's good!

409
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,479
<i>(laughs raucously)</i>

410
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,756
- Can I help you?
- Coffee.

411
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,317
There's no coffee here in Nilbog.
It's the Devil's drink!

412
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,998
Eggs.

413
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,236
- Eugh!
- Bacon.

414
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,035
Are you crazy, boy?
We're vegetarians here in Nilbog.

415
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,232
Didn't you know that?

416
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,590
Here's some Nilbog milk.

417
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,951
Special milk, high in vitamin content.

418
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,072
- Here, it's free.
- Free?

419
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,749
Of course it's free.
We love tourists here in Nilbog.

420
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:45,273
Try some, boy. And have some
of your friends drink some also.

421
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,789
Thank you.

422
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,952
D'you feel all right?

423
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,912
Yeah.

424
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,590
- Hey, you.
- Yeah?

425
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,190
- Your friend has a message for you.
- Who? Arnold?

426
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:35,950
Yeah. He said to meet him in the house
that looks like an old church.

427
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,036
OK.

428
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,790
You can go through the woods.
It's only about a mile away.

429
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,153
Good morning, my little flower.

430
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,316
Oh!

431
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,195
No need to worry about the closed mouth.

432
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,233
You didn't have anything to say anyway.

433
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,032
Right?

434
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,596
With this you will become strong

435
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,632
and beautiful.

436
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,515
Now, I am going to welcome
our new neighbours.

437
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,198
I have just prepared this pudding

438
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,039
with wild nettles

439
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,073
and a few organic additives

440
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,998
to make it delicious

441
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,511
and purify the intestines.

442
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,435
See you later, my little flower.

443
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,434
We have to wait and be patient.

444
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,831
Grandpa! Grandpa Seth! Are you there?

445
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,634
Nilbog! It's "goblin" spelt backwards!

446
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,912
This is their kingdom.

447
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,992
Good morning.

448
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,395
I am your neighbour.

449
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:04,595
- I am Creedence Leonor Gielgud.
- Good morning.

450
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,393
Mom, I'm going for a walk.

451
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,195
- Hello, beautiful!
- Hi.

452
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,039
She is very

453
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,038
- appetising.
- Appetising?

454
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,276
Provocative.

455
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:26,953
I thought you might enjoy
one of my ancient recipes.

456
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,675
It's a traditional dish in these parts.

457
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,837
You shouldn't have gone
to so much trouble.

458
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,554
No trouble.

459
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,432
Really.

460
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,592
The lowest instincts
are spreading in a horrifying way.

461
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,475
All men, especially men from the cities,

462
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:35,630
are letting themselves succumb
to the vices of meat...

463
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:19,640
The flesh.
The decaying part of the body.

464
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,118
It is so material and repulsive.
Repulsive!

465
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,310
They're still here!

466
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,477
Symbol of original sin,

467
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:35,754
which has consumed and
caused the fall of the human race

which is so dear to us.

469

Flesh!

470
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,594
And by flesh I mean
all that stinking, disgusting meat.

471
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,757
- <i>(everyone)</i> Eugh.
- Hamburgers!

472

- Eugh!
- Steaks, the steak sausages!

473
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:59,918
And hot dogs,
sold by the side of the road.

474
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:05,160
The stink of smoked carcasses.

475
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,633
Eugh!

476
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,796
<i>(groaning)</i>

477

The humans nourish themselves
with these,

478
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,517
violating their own bodies,

479
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,949
infecting themselves,

480

creating uncurable ailments.

- Smelly bladders.
- Eugh!

482
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,517
Nests of infection.

483

- Clusters of haemorrhoids!
- Eugh!

Argh!

488
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,351
Elliot? Elliot!

489
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,514
Holly. What a surprise.

490
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,030
Choose, Elliot. Either me or your friends.

491

I don't understand.

492

D'you understand now?

493
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,871
Is it ready?

494
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,673
Here it is. Nice and creamy.

495
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:30,472
This is a wonderful cup of Nilbog
ice cream for a little child.

496
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,030
You're going to stuff yourself
with it, aren't you?

497
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,358
Kids with a sweet tooth like yours
love ice cream.

498
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,397
Help, Grandpa Seth! Help!

499

<i>(everyone)</i> Mm.
Open your mouth, my little friend.

No, I won't! I don't want to!

Joshua!

Stop!

508
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,750
What are you doing to my son?

509
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,317
- We were giving him some ice cream.
- Daddy, they're goblins!

510
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,557
- Monstrous beings!
- What?

511
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,150
They were giving me ice cream
so they could eat me later.

512
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,989
An active imagination.
A bit morbid, isn't he?

513
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:46,193
Look! They all have a mole
the shape of a clover leaf!

514
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,915
And Nilbog is "goblin" spelt backwards.

515
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,600
I'm telling you, Daddy. They're monsters.

516
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,954
Mr and Mrs Presents,
what are you doing here?

517
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:00,277
You were supposed to be at my house.

518
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,756
We had car trouble.
We'll be leaving this evening.

519
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,189
OK.

520
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,993
It was nice meeting... meeting all of you.

521
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,759
My son and I must be leaving now.

522
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,157
We need time
for some things to happen.

523
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,316
We must have patience until tonight.

524
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,672
- Christ!
- What?

525
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,759
Your sister Holly's
with that playboy son of the Coopers.

526
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,118
- They're my friends!
- Who do you think you are?

527
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,879
- Don't ever hit me again.
- Stop it!

528
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,638
Oh, no!

529
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,318
- So, kids, how's life?
- Listen, Mr Waits...

530
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,274
I don't speak to people who arrive late
and upset their girlfriends.

531
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,073
- You've given me a bad impression.
- Come on, Dad.

532
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,954
- We'll talk, Holly. OK?
- We need to have a serious talk.

533
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:45,710
Forget about your friends and
come to our house, or forget about Holly.

534
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,910
- All right. I'm coming.
- Elliot!

535
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,793
- You're gonna leave me here alone?
- Yes.

536
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,992
- What do I tell Drew and Arnold?
- Whatever you want.

537
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:58,875
- What am I gonna do?
- Take the camper. Do what you want.

538
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,195
What about the beautiful liberated girls?

539
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,916
Is anyone here?

540
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,552
Shit!

541
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,630

00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,269
- Get me outta here, Drew. Get me out.
- OK. OK, don't fret.

551
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,313
Hurry, before that crazy lady gets back.

552

Oh, no.

What are you gonna do to me with that?

We wanted to make up

Look! All the people of Nilbog

Joshua! I've had enough. I want you

01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:56,872
He was one of us and you killed him!
Now it's your turn!

629
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,792
Joshua!

630
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,956
Quick, get in the house!

Oh, Lord of the magic rock of Stonehenge!

Come and protect your children!

Come and give us strength!

Give me all my old powers,
oh, Lord of the magic rock!

636
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:35,032
There's sandwiches for tonight in here.
It will go easier if you eat 'em.

637
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,277
You'll make <i>our</i> work easier.

638
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,315
Otherwise, we'll be forced
to kill you violently!

639
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,312
It would be a shame!
The blood would mix with the meat.

640
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:55,194
We'd have to put them in vinegar
for the whole night.

641

Dear God! What can we do?

642
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:08,837
We don't even have enough weapons
to defend ourselves.

643
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:14,790
- Do something, Elliot! Please!
- I don't know what to do.

644
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:21,750
- We need Grandpa Seth here!
- Joshua, Grandpa Seth is dead.

645
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:25,919
I know he's dead, but up till now
he's been the one helping us.

646
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:30,955
But how do we get him to come?
By holding a seance, maybe?

647
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,436
You're a genius, big sister!

Only the power of goodness
