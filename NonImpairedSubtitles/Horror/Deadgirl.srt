1
00:00:58,968 --> 00:01:04,915
Hey, yo, JT. Man, what word
starts with "F" and ends with "U-C-K"?

2
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:06,993
Come on.

3
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,440
Firetruck, man.

4
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:12,433
What are you, 8?

5
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:17,262
Man it's too hot for this shit.

6
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,789
Fuckin' drills.

7
00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:23,054
Hey, Bar go long. Come on.

8
00:01:35,418 --> 00:01:37,240
What are you staring at?

9
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,192
Johnny.

10
00:01:54,938 --> 00:01:57,043
Rickie, she's just a
waste of your time, man.

11
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,609
No, man.

12
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,599
She's not so bad.

13
00:01:59,642 --> 00:02:01,332
Sorry. Here you go.

14
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:07,567
Hey, let's blow this. C'mon..

15
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:09,172
Nobody will notice.

16
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:10,193
Let's get outta here.

17
00:02:14,746 --> 00:02:16,088
Alright.

18
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,851
Rickie's cuttin' class, man.
I can't hardly believe it.

19
00:02:49,884 --> 00:02:51,542
Well, you better believe it now.

20
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:57,145
Shit, man, I just keep thinking all the
fun stuff you're missing, you know.

21
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,622
You're missing uh,
the fuckin', gay coach Hankens.

22
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:06,003
And fuckin' faggot gym showers and fuckin'

23
00:03:06,044 --> 00:03:08,347
queer jock motherfuckers
fuckin' with you all day long.

24
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:11,064
You missed all those things.
I know you do.

25
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:13,818
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you miss that, right?

26
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:17,208
Joann Skinner.

27
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:19,221
Oh Rickie!

28
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:20,789
Rickie, Rickie, Rickie.

29
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,002
Come on, man! Let that shit go!

30
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,493
Come on, man, let it up!

31
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:27,027
Rickie!!!

32
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,556
Rickie you got to get
over that shit, man!

33
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:31,738
4th grade's a long time ago.

34
00:03:31,774 --> 00:03:33,718
You lost Joann to puberty
and you ain't gettin' her back.

35
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:38,393
You should have fucked her when you were 9
when you had the chance, boy!

36
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:52,214
Look, man, what are we gonna do?

37
00:03:52,254 --> 00:03:53,782
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

38
00:03:53,823 --> 00:03:55,001
Quit you're whining.

39
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,275
Look, I brought some brews.

40
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:58,718
- Oh yeah.
- All right, but not right here.

41
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:00,060
Let's go to the nuthouse.
Whaddya say?

42
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:04,088
What, the nuthouse?

43
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:06,549
The nuthouse, man?

44
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:08,446
Why would you want to go there?

45
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,454
'Cause it's fuckin' hot out.

46
00:04:11,296 --> 00:04:13,052
You've got a better idea?

47
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,843
I guess not, man.

48
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:18,015
JT, man, aren't there any
security guards there or something?

49
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:19,902
There's no fucking
security guards, man.

50
00:04:19,936 --> 00:04:21,791
The place is dead.

51
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:23,831
The place is deader than dead.
Come on.

52
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:27,163
We always talked about goin' in there.
Lets do it.

53
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:27,866
The place is fucking huge.

54
00:05:29,826 --> 00:05:32,925
Think of all the crazies that lived here.

55
00:05:32,963 --> 00:05:34,075
You trying to scare me?

56
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:36,832
Oh, man. I'm just saying.

57
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:38,556
All the drugs they used to serve out here.

58
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:39,642
Shit.

59
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:43,967
Keep us floating for a lifetime.

60
00:05:44,002 --> 00:05:45,083
- Hell yeah.
- Right!

61
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:55,360
Hey!

62
00:05:55,395 --> 00:05:57,784
I think it's time for some warm beer.

63
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:03,165
Yeah!

64
00:06:13,732 --> 00:06:16,099
Alright, Rick.

65
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:05,723
It's not as scary as
it looks on the outside, man.

66
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:09,082
Kind of like it here.

67
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,573
I bet you would,
fucking padded walls and all.

68
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,327
Fucking dick.

69
00:07:16,742 --> 00:07:19,361
Well, it sure beats hangin' out
in that parking lot. That's for sure.

70
00:07:24,838 --> 00:07:28,155
You want to see real scary though?

71
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,857
You gotta go down to the tunnel.

72
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,352
These tunnels, they go to all
the other buildings, that way

73
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:44,166
they wouldn't have to take the
real dangerous patients outside

74
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,686
to get them to a different cell or something.

75
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:48,549
They never went outside?

76
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,143
Not the murderers.

77
00:07:50,184 --> 00:07:51,612
Or the real fucked-up ones.

78
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:56,740
They kept murderers in here man?

79
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:03,361
JT.

80
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,685
JT.

81
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,895
C'mon man, where'd you go?

82
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:33,918
What are you, 8?

83
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:36,099
Oh, come on.
You were scared just a little bit.

84
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:45,257
Quit fucking around, JT.

85
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:48,835
It didn't work a second ago
and it ain't working now.

86
00:08:48,873 --> 00:08:50,117
JT.

87
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:52,354
I'm not doing anything.

88
00:08:55,658 --> 00:08:56,902
What the hell is that?

89
00:09:05,514 --> 00:09:07,172
Oh, shit.

90
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,665
I thought you said there
weren't any guard dogs.

91
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,374
That ain't no guard dog.

92
00:09:15,498 --> 00:09:16,643
Run, run!!!

93
00:09:30,123 --> 00:09:31,300
Holy shit!

94
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:33,030
Shit!

95
00:09:34,186 --> 00:09:38,660
Man, I haven't been that scared since those
cop chased us down on the 4th of July.

96
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:42,277
Yeah, well I'd rather deal with
pissed-off pigs than pissed-off dogs.

97
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:47,433
Come on.

98
00:09:47,468 --> 00:09:48,548
There's gotta be a way out of here.

99
00:09:49,451 --> 00:09:50,695
There's got to be.

100
00:10:20,973 --> 00:10:22,828
I think I see a door down here.

101
00:10:26,637 --> 00:10:28,392
Man, it looks like a dead end.

102
00:10:31,437 --> 00:10:33,858
Oh yeah. There's definitely
a door back here, Rickie.

103
00:10:39,117 --> 00:10:40,743
Where do you think that goes?

104
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:44,551
I hope it goes out of here.

105
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:46,989
Darn it!

106
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:57,479
Come here and help me move this stuff.

107
00:10:57,518 --> 00:10:59,144
It's locked JT. I -

108
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,500
That's not locked, just rusted shut.

109
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:13,379
Come here and help me, man.

110
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:30,055
Push.

111
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:32,813
Push boy.

112
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:38,955
Push harder, man.
Put your back into it.

113
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,433
JT, what the fuck is going on, man?

114
00:12:54,227 --> 00:12:55,721
Hey.

115
00:12:55,762 --> 00:12:56,875
What is it?

116
00:13:02,707 --> 00:13:03,820
Holy shit!

117
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:11,979
JT, what the hell, man?
What's going on?

118
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:13,098
What is it?

119
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:17,418
Holy shit.

120
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,986
What?

121
00:13:19,027 --> 00:13:20,653
You're never going to believe this, Ricky.

122
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:29,840
Holy shit, man.

123
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:30,956
Yeah, I told you.

124
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:34,347
What the fuck is she doing down here JT?

125
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:51,049
- She... you think she's fuckin -
- There's one way to find out.

126
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:52,020
Holy shit.

127
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:53,875
Holy shit, man.

128
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:55,370
What the fuck is she doing out here?

129
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:56,460
Oh my God.

130
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,672
She didn't just tie herself to that fucking bed.
Man, that's for sure.

131
00:13:58,708 --> 00:13:59,570
Well, we better get out of here, man.

132
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,874
- We gotta -
- Sh-sh-sh.

133
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,403
We got to get the fuck out of here.

134
00:14:04,597 --> 00:14:06,769
Just hold on a second, bro.

135
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,081
Hold on a second.

136
00:14:08,116 --> 00:14:11,314
There's a fucking naked woman, man.
Lets go.

137
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:13,137
Oh shit.

138
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,046
We gotta get out of here JT!

139
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:17,579
Hold on a second.

140
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:20,556
All right.

141
00:14:20,597 --> 00:14:21,906
Now, we had to pry
that door open, right?

142
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:23,088
You saw it yourself.

143
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:26,257
- Yeah.
- It was rusted shut, remember?

144
00:14:26,294 --> 00:14:30,091
And we've been out here all day.

145
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:32,468
There ain't nobody here but us, right?

146
00:14:32,502 --> 00:14:33,877
- Right?
- Alright. Good man.

147
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:37,227
Good. Now, let's free the fucking girl and
get the fuck out of here, man. Please.

148
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,059
No.

149
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,615
JT, cut it out!

150
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:50,451
Cut it out.

151
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:51,415
Hey!

152
00:14:56,151 --> 00:15:01,072
JT, man, maybe some girl
has been missing, right?

153
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,526
I mean, there could be some kind
of reward or something, you know?

154
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,112
We could keep her.

155
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:15,668
What?

156
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:19,502
Keep her, man?

157
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,472
What?

158
00:15:22,136 --> 00:15:23,597
JT, man. Keep her?

159
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,451
Just till tonight.

160
00:15:26,487 --> 00:15:27,797
Tomorrow.

161
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,158
JT, keep her?

162
00:15:32,217 --> 00:15:35,632
She's like someone in a magazine.

163
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:37,494
What are talking about man?
Let's go!

164
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,102
Look at her.

165
00:15:41,144 --> 00:15:43,566
I can spend all day
looking at that body.

166
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:45,397
Jesus fucking Christ!

167
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:50,963
She is beautiful.

168
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:53,008
I mean... Jesus, JT, this is stupid, man.

169
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:55,154
We gotta free the girl and
get the fuck outta here. Please, man.

170
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,009
I'm begging you.

171
00:15:58,168 --> 00:16:04,213
- What are you doing, man. Come on.
- Well, that's nice man.

172
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,039
You got come here and
you're going to feel that.

173
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:07,862
Come here and feel it.

174
00:16:07,898 --> 00:16:09,360
Come here and feel that.

175
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:11,638
Come here just feel it man.

176
00:16:11,674 --> 00:16:14,641
There's no way I'm gonna fucking...

177
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,983
Your loss.

178
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,392
JT cut it out man, seriously.

179
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:19,702
Just fuck off for me, man.

180
00:16:19,738 --> 00:16:20,534
No, man.

181
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,432
What you're doing man?

182
00:16:22,457 --> 00:16:24,825
What the fuck JT!

183
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:28,246
What the fuck has
gotten into you, man?

184
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:34,384
What the fuck's gotten into you, man?

185
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,721
Look, man. Look at that chick.

186
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:44,441
You're fucking sick, man.

187
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:51,316
You don't want any of this
just go and get out here.

188
00:16:51,356 --> 00:16:54,170
You were never here,
as far as I'm concerned.

189
00:16:54,203 --> 00:16:55,218
Go on.

190
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,695
Go on.

191
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:07,895
Just get out... get out of here.

192
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:50,202
Ma, you home?

193
00:18:03,358 --> 00:18:05,693
- 911 what's your emergency?
- Damn, what happened to your face?

194
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:11,798
Where is my mom at?

195
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:13,180
Well, she picked up an extra shift today.

196
00:18:13,214 --> 00:18:15,221
She said she'd be home
around midnight.

197
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:18,110
Yeah. Well, what are you doing here, Clint?

198
00:18:18,143 --> 00:18:21,917
Your mom said it be all right,
if I stick around for a few weeks.

199
00:18:26,111 --> 00:18:28,761
Man, I hope you gave as
good as you got, man.

200
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:32,989
You got to stand up to these bastards and give
it to them worse than they gave it to you, hmm?

201
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:36,438
In this world, you can't let
other people fight your battles for you.

202
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:39,447
It's called TCB, Rickie, huh?

203
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,821
Taking care of business.

204
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:44,343
That's great fucking advice, Clint.
I mean, thank you.

205
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:47,645
Especially coming from a fucking alcoholic
who can't even pay his fucking rent.

206
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,980
Hey, why don't you drink
some more of mom's beers

207
00:18:50,015 --> 00:18:51,990
and then tell me about being real man, huh?

208
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:54,715
You know what Ricky?
Why the attitude, man?

209
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:55,929
I'm just trying to help you.

210
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:57,876
Well, gee whiz Clint, thank you.

211
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,524
You know what? It was your god damned mom's
idea for me to talk to you in the first place.

212
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,821
I know all the talking in the world
is not going to make you be a man.

213
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:07,285
You got to do it yourself.

214
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,677
Fucking kids.

215
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,592
Hope you're not seeing my
face when you pull that trigger.

216
00:19:37,537 --> 00:19:39,195
Rickie!

217
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:42,781
Rickie man.
Come on, we've been friends too long.

218
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:45,053
Yeah, I thought we were
friends up until you punched me.

219
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:49,981
I'm sorry about that, all right?

220
00:19:50,018 --> 00:19:51,960
And what about her, man.
You're sorry about that too?

221
00:19:52,002 --> 00:19:56,093
That's why I came down here because
I need you to go back there with me, man.

222
00:20:00,674 --> 00:20:01,918
No way, man.

223
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:03,480
Fucking forget it.

224
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:05,824
Rickie, please man.

225
00:20:05,858 --> 00:20:08,127
Please, there's something you got to see.
It's real important, man.

226
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:08,991
It's really important.

227
00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:10,848
If it's so important,
why don't you just tell me right here, JT.

228
00:20:10,882 --> 00:20:13,021
Because you got to see it.

229
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:15,928
Man, you wouldn't believe me
if I just told you.

230
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:16,919
No.

231
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:18,107
No, JT.

232
00:20:18,147 --> 00:20:21,181
I don't wanna be an accessory to whatever
sick shit you're doing, man.

233
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:23,640
Rickie, please.

234
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:25,592
You have to see this.

235
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:48,187
We're lettin' her go, JT, OK?
That's all there is to it, man.

236
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:49,919
And hopefully,
she doesn't send us to jail.

237
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:51,930
She's not going to send me to jail.

238
00:20:51,972 --> 00:20:53,532
Why not?

239
00:20:53,572 --> 00:20:56,387
I mean what did you do to her, JT?
What the fuck did you do to her, man?

240
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,769
Fuckin' killin' me...

241
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,776
Fuck, no way.

242
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:07,966
You can just tell me what you did to her, man.

243
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:17,373
She woke up.

244
00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:27,325
She started to struggle,
of course, but she didn't scream.

245
00:21:27,365 --> 00:21:30,180
No. She just sort of growled.

246
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:40,190
And tried to bite like a
wild fucking dog, you know.

247
00:21:40,229 --> 00:21:45,314
So, uh, I hit her

248
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,684
just enough
to make her stop, you know.

249
00:21:47,718 --> 00:21:49,725
Oh, man.

250
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,676
But she didn't.

251
00:21:51,718 --> 00:21:53,092
She sure did not stop.

252
00:21:53,126 --> 00:21:57,381
She just kept gnashing
at me with those teeth.

253
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:07,527
So, I hit her again and it felt good.

254
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:11,331
You wouldn't know about that.

255
00:22:15,943 --> 00:22:18,114
Then I hit her harder.

256
00:22:18,151 --> 00:22:20,704
- What the fuck did you do, man?
-And harder and harder.

257
00:22:20,744 --> 00:22:21,790
JT.

258
00:22:21,831 --> 00:22:24,733
Needless to say, after a while,
she stopped moving.

259
00:22:24,775 --> 00:22:27,077
For Christ's sakes, man.
You fucking killed her.

260
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,224
You realize that man?

261
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,460
You fucking killed her and you bring me down
her and show me a fucking corpse, man?

262
00:22:31,496 --> 00:22:33,150
Rickie!
You're a sick fuck, man.

263
00:22:33,191 --> 00:22:35,014
I've had enough of your psycho shit.
We're taking her out of here now, JT.

264
00:22:35,048 --> 00:22:37,088
- Hold on a sec!
- No, this has gone far enough.

265
00:22:37,128 --> 00:22:38,786
You have to see
what I brought you here for.

266
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,824
I've seen more than enough, JT.

267
00:22:41,864 --> 00:22:43,555
Rickie, no you haven't.

268
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:46,403
No.

269
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,782
What the fuck are you doing, JT?

270
00:22:47,816 --> 00:22:49,310
- What the fuck are you doing, man!
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

271
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:51,457
No, man, no!

272
00:22:58,568 --> 00:22:59,778
Rickie.

273
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:01,256
Rickie!

274
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:02,882
Man, get the fuck away from me, man.

275
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:04,349
No, no! It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

276
00:23:04,393 --> 00:23:05,637
It's okay. It's all right.

277
00:23:05,672 --> 00:23:06,882
Take it easy. Take it easy. Take it easy.

278
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:08,296
Take it easy, JT?

279
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:10,336
You fucking killed her, man.
You killed her with my fucking gun.

280
00:23:10,377 --> 00:23:12,286
- Hold on a second man.
- You son of a bitch.

281
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:13,507
- You're a sick fuck, JT.
- Look!

282
00:23:13,545 --> 00:23:14,822
- You sick fuck!
- Look!

283
00:23:14,857 --> 00:23:15,872
Look!

284
00:23:22,153 --> 00:23:25,186
It's a pretty active for a dead girl,
don't you think?

285
00:23:25,225 --> 00:23:26,338
What the fuck!

286
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:33,224
I had to bring you down here, man.

287
00:23:33,257 --> 00:23:34,567
Had to make you see her for yourself.

288
00:23:34,602 --> 00:23:37,668
We got to get her to a fucking hospital
before she bleeds to death, JT.

289
00:23:37,705 --> 00:23:39,778
She ain't gonna bleed to death, man.

290
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:47,653
You had to see it for yourself, Rickie.

291
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:54,176
Because I knew you wouldn't
believe if I just told you.

292
00:23:54,219 --> 00:23:57,732
Jesus.

293
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,421
Tell me about it.

294
00:24:00,459 --> 00:24:02,313
Because I thought I was going crazy.

295
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:09,028
I wasn't telling the complete truth earlier.

296
00:24:11,404 --> 00:24:18,890
You see, I heard her neck crack.

297
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,353
I broke her fucking neck, man.

298
00:24:20,396 --> 00:24:23,298
- I know that I did.
- No way.

299
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:26,917
Shit! I was trying to think what I was going
to do about it and she starts moving again!

300
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:32,296
I thought I was going crazy, man.

301
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:35,430
I stuck my thumbs real deep into her neck

302
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,653
until she quit moving.

303
00:24:39,693 --> 00:24:44,482
A few minutes later,
she starts kicking again.

304
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:48,419
I killed her 3 times now.

305
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:50,348
Look at her.

306
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:54,731
This isn't real man.

307
00:24:54,765 --> 00:24:57,099
This isn't real.

308
00:24:57,133 --> 00:24:58,759
Oh, man. Is she on drugs?

309
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:02,594
I've never seen no drugs that will let you
take 3 bullets like nothing happened.

310
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:09,891
Where do you think she came from?

311
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:12,519
Maybe she was a patient here?

312
00:25:12,557 --> 00:25:15,591
Maybe they did some mad scientist
experiment or some shit on her?

313
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,590
Who the fuck knows what they
did with the leftover people.

314
00:25:19,629 --> 00:25:22,215
The hopeless ones...

315
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:26,531
Shit, man. She can't be killed.

316
00:25:26,574 --> 00:25:29,957
I mean, it's fuckin' crazy.

317
00:25:29,998 --> 00:25:31,492
It's fucking crazy.

318
00:25:35,631 --> 00:25:37,386
It's awesome.

319
00:26:00,431 --> 00:26:02,220
Man, she's so cold.

320
00:26:04,431 --> 00:26:08,228
Well, she is naked.

321
00:26:08,272 --> 00:26:12,494
So, what do we do with her JT?

322
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:17,350
I mean, we could leave her be, you
know, just forget about her, I guess.

323
00:26:20,592 --> 00:26:23,756
Well, somebody else is bound
to find her, eventually, right?

324
00:26:26,224 --> 00:26:29,257
We could destroy her.

325
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:32,111
Ain't you suppose to get her kind
in the brain pan or something.

326
00:26:32,144 --> 00:26:34,665
JT, "her kind" man,
what the fuck are you saying?

327
00:26:34,704 --> 00:26:43,499
Sure, she is some kind of monster
or something but she's our monster.

328
00:26:48,017 --> 00:26:50,952
What you think?

329
00:26:50,993 --> 00:26:54,441
About what?

330
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:57,961
About hot pussy?

331
00:26:58,001 --> 00:27:00,422
Straight out of porn!

332
00:27:00,466 --> 00:27:01,873
Anytime we want it, boy.

333
00:27:01,906 --> 00:27:03,050
You and, and me.

334
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,097
I'm not fucking touching her man.

335
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:09,196
It's just asking for trouble JT,
okay, trouble I don't need, okay?

336
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:11,600
And you can't fucking be serious, man.

337
00:27:11,634 --> 00:27:13,357
Come on.

338
00:27:13,394 --> 00:27:17,617
Yeah, I think I am serious.

339
00:27:17,651 --> 00:27:20,138
Come on, what else you want to do?
Take her home and introduce her to your mom?

340
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:23,081
What?

341
00:27:23,122 --> 00:27:24,846
I got to think about this, JT. Okay?

342
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:33,677
Well, you take all the time you need 'cause,

343
00:27:33,715 --> 00:27:35,504
she ain't going anywhere.

344
00:27:45,362 --> 00:27:46,989
This is too fucking much, JT.

345
00:27:47,026 --> 00:27:48,620
She's staying here with us.

346
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,054
Okay. Okay.

347
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,362
But this stays
between you and me, right?

348
00:27:57,396 --> 00:27:58,323
Yeah.

349
00:27:58,355 --> 00:27:59,763
I'm serious man.
This is our secret.

350
00:27:59,795 --> 00:28:03,144
Me and you, JT and Rickie.

351
00:28:03,188 --> 00:28:04,529
Hey you want to see something?

352
00:28:28,724 --> 00:28:30,186
It's kind of fucked up, right?

353
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,037
Remember your oral
assignments are due this Friday.

354
00:29:37,585 --> 00:29:39,733
Yo! Rickie, what's up?

355
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:43,254
Go home early yesterday, huh?

356
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:44,749
You feeling all right?

357
00:29:48,312 --> 00:29:50,134
Mister talkative today, I guess.

358
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:54,707
What's up with you?

359
00:29:54,744 --> 00:29:56,370
Sorry Wheeler, man. I'm just thinking.

360
00:29:59,224 --> 00:30:01,842
Are you thinking about
Joann Skinner again?

361
00:30:04,376 --> 00:30:06,318
You better watch it with
those eyeballs there, buddy.

362
00:30:09,784 --> 00:30:14,382
- Have a good one, bro.
- I have to go.

363
00:30:14,393 --> 00:30:15,441
- No!
- Yes!

364
00:30:35,513 --> 00:30:36,888
Hey, Rickie.

365
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:42,484
Everything all right?

366
00:30:46,106 --> 00:30:48,277
I'm just thinking.

367
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:49,874
The dead should stay dead.

368
00:30:51,897 --> 00:30:54,615
So, you're thinking about reincarnation.

369
00:30:58,202 --> 00:31:00,984
Some people believe
in life after death.

370
00:31:03,034 --> 00:31:06,100
You're entitled to
whatever beliefs you like, Rickie.

371
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:09,173
I'd like to think that the
dead are happy where they are.

372
00:31:09,211 --> 00:31:15,157
They wouldn't want to come back because
they earned it.

373
00:31:15,194 --> 00:31:18,675
Far more glorious that all this.

374
00:31:18,715 --> 00:31:21,269
Yeah.

375
00:31:21,307 --> 00:31:23,347
Yeah, but what do you know, Mr. Harrison?

376
00:31:36,475 --> 00:31:37,490
What's up?

377
00:31:37,532 --> 00:31:39,223
Hey, Wheeler, man, what you doin' today?

378
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:41,082
You wanna go see if
Wes has got any weed?

379
00:31:41,115 --> 00:31:42,130
No, man I can't.

380
00:31:42,172 --> 00:31:43,960
I got plans.

381
00:31:43,995 --> 00:31:45,555
What, a hot date?

382
00:31:45,596 --> 00:31:47,484
Maybe.

383
00:31:47,517 --> 00:31:48,890
Later, bro.

384
00:31:52,316 --> 00:31:53,429
Alright later, Wheeler.

385
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:10,454
Ma, you home?

386
00:35:22,212 --> 00:35:24,798
Fucking, Wheeler?

387
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:25,763
Rickie!

388
00:35:26,979 --> 00:35:30,013
Hey Rickie.

389
00:35:30,052 --> 00:35:32,321
JT, man...

390
00:35:32,356 --> 00:35:35,705
Remember our fucking
conversation yesterday, man?

391
00:35:35,748 --> 00:35:37,123
What's your problem, man?

392
00:35:37,156 --> 00:35:40,539
My problem is we agreed not to
tell anybody about this, man.

393
00:35:40,581 --> 00:35:42,595
- What are you fucking thinking?
- I know, we did.

394
00:35:42,629 --> 00:35:45,215
I didn't want to be alone,
you know what I mean?

395
00:35:45,253 --> 00:35:48,733
- I just want to have some company...
- I'm here, aren't I?

396
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:49,755
I mean I'm here.

397
00:35:49,797 --> 00:35:53,889
Well, then go get some for once
instead of wishing that you could.

398
00:35:59,813 --> 00:36:01,918
JT, come on.

399
00:36:01,957 --> 00:36:04,924
It's not like that, okay?

400
00:36:04,965 --> 00:36:06,492
Look.

401
00:36:09,798 --> 00:36:11,172
Last night man, well...

402
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:14,724
Last night she uh...

403
00:36:16,262 --> 00:36:20,734
Fuck... She been looking at you?

404
00:36:20,774 --> 00:36:22,432
What?

405
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,964
Like she knows something.

406
00:36:25,414 --> 00:36:26,821
What the fuck are you talking about, Rickie?

407
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:29,789
Look, we can make things easier.

408
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,829
We can call her Joann if you want.

409
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:36,700
But you know that ain't
a real human being, man, right?

410
00:36:36,743 --> 00:36:39,012
You know that. It's all right.

411
00:36:39,047 --> 00:36:40,257
It's okay.

412
00:36:40,295 --> 00:36:41,920
That's besides the point, man.

413
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:45,090
Oh, is it?
Well, what are you doing down here, huh?

414
00:36:45,127 --> 00:36:46,502
I don't know, man.

415
00:36:51,463 --> 00:36:52,292
JT, man.

416
00:36:52,327 --> 00:36:57,411
I'm not... that's not what...
god damn it, JT.

417
00:36:57,447 --> 00:37:02,019
If you want, man, we can, like
flip her over. We haven't hit her backside yet.

418
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,382
No!

419
00:37:07,431 --> 00:37:08,577
Rickie.

420
00:37:08,616 --> 00:37:10,852
Pal.

421
00:37:10,888 --> 00:37:13,855
What's wrong?

422
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:16,481
This whole thing is fucking over,
you guys, seriously.

423
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,137
We're all going to
get arrested or worse.

424
00:37:19,176 --> 00:37:21,216
I mean, JT...

425
00:37:21,256 --> 00:37:23,777
Look, how long have we known Wheeler?

426
00:37:23,816 --> 00:37:26,151
All our lives?

427
00:37:26,184 --> 00:37:27,362
He knows how to keep a secret.

428
00:37:27,401 --> 00:37:29,669
He knows a good thing when he
sees it, don't you, Wheeler?

429
00:37:29,704 --> 00:37:31,646
I know a good thing when I fuck it.

430
00:37:31,688 --> 00:37:33,346
There you go.

431
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:36,003
So, you see
there's nothing to worry about, Rickie.

432
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:40,678
It's just you and me and
Wheeler and the dead girl.

433
00:37:40,714 --> 00:37:43,364
She's not just some dead girl, man.

434
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:49,572
Well, I did kill her 3 times.

435
00:37:54,442 --> 00:37:56,002
Go on. Give it a try.

436
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:56,772
Get on it, man.

437
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:59,046
Man, it's fuckin' sweet!

438
00:37:59,082 --> 00:38:00,358
Fucking get in there, man.

439
00:38:00,393 --> 00:38:01,921
Go on.

440
00:38:02,026 --> 00:38:03,073
Go on!

441
00:38:05,481 --> 00:38:08,416
Rickie! All right.
Well, come back in a couple of hours.

442
00:38:08,457 --> 00:38:09,286
We'll be gone.

443
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:16,479
You can have nice private romantic time
and do lots of nice sensitive things.

444
00:38:16,523 --> 00:38:18,661
Nice one.

445
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:20,105
God bless.

446
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:46,656
Look, I told you fuckers,
if you want weed, you need to--

447
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,831
I need some bolt cutters.

448
00:38:49,868 --> 00:38:51,329
Got any money?

449
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:53,127
Come on, Wes.
You know I'm good for it, man.

450
00:40:35,311 --> 00:40:36,805
Everything's going to be okay, alright?

451
00:40:36,847 --> 00:40:37,741
I'll get you out of here.

452
00:40:40,784 --> 00:40:43,817
I'm here to help you, okay?

453
00:40:49,008 --> 00:40:50,501
Oh shit!

454
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:19,305
Do you understand me?

455
00:41:19,345 --> 00:41:22,411
I'm going to get you out of here, okay?

456
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:24,107
You have to be quiet.

457
00:41:24,146 --> 00:41:25,738
Okay.

458
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:27,119
You should be quiet.

459
00:41:40,434 --> 00:41:44,176
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

460
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,031
Okay.

461
00:42:40,564 --> 00:42:42,898
Did you leave the
fucking door open, Wheeler?

462
00:42:42,932 --> 00:42:45,867
No, I don't think so.

463
00:42:45,908 --> 00:42:48,176
I told you to keep that door shut, didn't I?

464
00:42:48,212 --> 00:42:50,317
Why does it matter?

465
00:42:50,356 --> 00:42:51,981
I want that dog messing with her.

466
00:42:54,581 --> 00:42:56,074
Anybody humps her leg, it's me.

467
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,706
What's up, baby?
How are you doing?

468
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:09,904
Why don't you busy
yourself somewhere else.

469
00:43:09,941 --> 00:43:12,080
Hey baby, you miss me?

470
00:43:24,533 --> 00:43:25,461
Oh shit!

471
00:43:25,494 --> 00:43:26,639
Oh fuck!

472
00:43:32,214 --> 00:43:33,555
Oh fuck!

473
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,728
Grab her fucking hand, man!

474
00:43:36,501 --> 00:43:38,411
Get her fucking hand.

475
00:43:38,455 --> 00:43:40,210
Get the fuck down!

476
00:43:40,246 --> 00:43:42,963
- Fuckin stop it!
- Fucking get her off!

477
00:43:44,278 --> 00:43:47,246
Fucking, you ain't no help man!

478
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:55,125
She nearly fucking killed us, man!

479
00:43:58,967 --> 00:44:01,455
- I oughta fucking bite you!
- How the fuck did she get free, man?

480
00:44:05,687 --> 00:44:06,702
Do you hear that?

481
00:44:08,727 --> 00:44:10,156
Rickie is that you?

482
00:44:13,303 --> 00:44:14,481
Rickie!!!

483
00:44:17,495 --> 00:44:20,343
If I find out it was you trying to
let her loose you're gonna regret it.

484
00:44:21,336 --> 00:44:23,572
Might as well come out now!

485
00:44:29,272 --> 00:44:31,159
Stupid, fucking motherfucker!

486
00:44:31,897 --> 00:44:33,718
There ain't no way you're getting in here!

487
00:44:33,752 --> 00:44:35,246
Lil Bitch!

488
00:44:35,288 --> 00:44:36,270
I swear to God!

489
00:44:36,312 --> 00:44:39,378
I'm gonna bring a gun tomorrow.
I'm going to shoot your ass dead!

490
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:40,758
You hear that?

491
00:44:43,256 --> 00:44:46,158
Fuckin A. If it ain't one thing it's another.

492
00:45:10,169 --> 00:45:11,413
Sorry.

493
00:45:13,017 --> 00:45:15,123
What, man?

494
00:45:15,162 --> 00:45:17,496
You're friends with Wheeler?

495
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:19,472
You know where I could find him?

496
00:45:19,513 --> 00:45:20,920
No.

497
00:45:21,658 --> 00:45:24,178
Because he said if I brought him 10 bucks,
he'd show me something.

498
00:45:24,985 --> 00:45:26,033
What?

499
00:45:26,075 --> 00:45:26,936
Wheeler?

500
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:30,385
- He said -
- Wheeler's a fucking retard you dumb ass.

501
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:37,913
He's just trying to steal your money, man.

502
00:45:56,923 --> 00:45:58,483
Hey, asshole!
Fuckin' fat kid just came up to me, man...

503
00:45:58,523 --> 00:45:59,767
It was you last night?

504
00:45:59,803 --> 00:46:00,817
Yeah, so what?

505
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:02,615
What's up, Johnny boy?

506
00:46:02,652 --> 00:46:04,310
You know,
I'm sorry you got hurt, Wheeler, but, fuck...

507
00:46:04,347 --> 00:46:05,689
You know, fuck you.

508
00:46:05,723 --> 00:46:07,512
You're just fucking lucky
I didn't tell JT about that.

509
00:46:07,547 --> 00:46:10,003
Yeah? Hey, why the fuck
didn't you then, huh?

510
00:46:10,043 --> 00:46:11,505
Do you see that dip shit over there?

511
00:46:11,548 --> 00:46:12,922
Lots of dipshits over there.
Which one are you talking about?

512
00:46:12,956 --> 00:46:14,844
The fucking stoner
with his retarded buddy.

513
00:46:14,876 --> 00:46:16,250
He was looking over here all goddamn period.

514
00:46:16,284 --> 00:46:17,746
He was eyeballing Joann, dude.

515
00:46:17,788 --> 00:46:21,716
You know what, man? Me and JT are fine.

516
00:46:21,756 --> 00:46:23,993
OK, it's you that's he's
fucking worried about.

517
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,833
Look, Wheeler,
JT hasn't fucking been in school in days, man.

518
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,552
Somebody is going to notice and then what?

519
00:46:30,589 --> 00:46:31,603
What?

520
00:46:31,644 --> 00:46:33,019
They'll go looking, you fucking retard.

521
00:46:33,052 --> 00:46:34,394
That's bullshit man.

522
00:46:34,429 --> 00:46:37,014
Nobody cares a fucking shit about JT
except for JT, okay?

523
00:46:37,052 --> 00:46:38,743
Not the school,
not his fucking grandmother,

524
00:46:38,781 --> 00:46:41,050
who's half-near dead anyways, okay?

525
00:46:41,085 --> 00:46:44,468
Nobody gives a shit where he goes
or what he does, right?

526
00:46:44,508 --> 00:46:45,785
Nobody but us.

527
00:47:09,949 --> 00:47:10,965
Look at me.

528
00:47:11,902 --> 00:47:13,756
Look at me.

529
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:14,870
Come on now.

530
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:25,532
Yeah, you fucking like that, don't you,
you fucking dead little fucking zombie.

531
00:47:25,566 --> 00:47:27,093
I'm comin', yeah.

532
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:35,445
How's her hole doin', man?

533
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:38,585
Unwilling but able as always.

534
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:55,578
We got to...we got to get some lube
or something in there

535
00:47:55,615 --> 00:47:57,754
because she is just bone dry.

536
00:48:07,712 --> 00:48:09,305
What do you think she is, JT?

537
00:48:15,072 --> 00:48:16,665
Our fuck-slave.

538
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,793
I mean, seriously, like,

539
00:48:20,832 --> 00:48:25,436
I don't know, man, like, what is she
doing here and like how did she get here?

540
00:48:26,561 --> 00:48:28,252
What's your problem?

541
00:48:28,289 --> 00:48:29,499
Nothing.

542
00:48:29,537 --> 00:48:31,325
I'm just asking, you know.

543
00:48:35,777 --> 00:48:37,500
How long have you been here anyway?

544
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:42,936
I spent the night.

545
00:48:42,977 --> 00:48:45,116
Why?

546
00:48:45,153 --> 00:48:47,456
Because it's starting to stink.

547
00:48:53,282 --> 00:48:59,479
Well, that is coming from the wounds.

548
00:48:59,522 --> 00:49:01,409
I smelled it this morning.

549
00:49:06,018 --> 00:49:07,676
What the fuck is that?

550
00:49:09,282 --> 00:49:15,742
No worse for wear but... it's warm.

551
00:49:15,779 --> 00:49:16,826
Wet.

552
00:49:22,147 --> 00:49:24,057
Yeah.

553
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:26,400
That one's mine,
but there's 2 more just like it.

554
00:49:29,123 --> 00:49:30,235
Okay.

555
00:50:10,564 --> 00:50:12,474
What are you staring at?

556
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,097
You.

557
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:19,328
No, you're not.

558
00:50:30,725 --> 00:50:36,508
Hey, remember that time when were,
like, 8 or something?

559
00:50:36,549 --> 00:50:37,694
8?

560
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:41,989
Okay, 8, 9, you know, whatever.
Just let me finish.

561
00:50:42,022 --> 00:50:44,575
We were 12.

562
00:50:44,613 --> 00:50:46,882
What, was I your first kiss or something?

563
00:50:51,493 --> 00:50:58,018
Hey, would you want to
go out with me sometime?

564
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:09,536
That was a long time ago.

565
00:51:09,574 --> 00:51:12,389
I mean, another life.

566
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,689
Nothing lasts forever, Rickie.

567
00:51:41,353 --> 00:51:43,654
- Fuck man.
- Take it easy, man.

568
00:51:43,687 --> 00:51:46,371
I'm sorry, man.

569
00:51:46,407 --> 00:51:47,356
Nice.

570
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:52,957
You want to head back there with me?

571
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,848
Look, Wheeler, I fucking told you already.
I'm not goin' back there.

572
00:51:57,032 --> 00:51:57,960
Fuck!

573
00:51:57,992 --> 00:51:59,421
You get the message shit stain?

574
00:51:59,464 --> 00:52:01,668
What the fuck man?!

575
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:03,265
What's that, pussy?

576
00:52:03,304 --> 00:52:07,079
He thinks I can't see him when
he's staring and drooling over Joann!

577
00:52:07,113 --> 00:52:08,357
What are they doing now?

578
00:52:08,393 --> 00:52:11,010
Shut your filthy mouth, man.
Shut the fuck up!

579
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:16,993
All right, you little shits.

580
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:18,691
Keep your eyes to yourself.

581
00:52:18,729 --> 00:52:20,868
I don't know what the fuck
are you talking about?

582
00:52:22,665 --> 00:52:24,039
Fuck!

583
00:52:24,073 --> 00:52:26,561
- Johnny stop! Johnny!
- No more looking at my woman you little shit!

584
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,095
You got that?

585
00:52:28,137 --> 00:52:28,933
Stop!

586
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:31,173
Johnny stop!
That¡¦s enough, Okay? I want to go home.

587
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:33,763
Come on baby,
I'm just defending your honor over here?

588
00:52:33,801 --> 00:52:36,037
No, you're not.
You're just being an asshole!

589
00:52:41,354 --> 00:52:42,248
Stop it!

590
00:52:42,282 --> 00:52:44,354
- Get off of me!
- Look, we're just having a little fun!

591
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:45,768
- Stop!
- That's all!

592
00:52:53,035 --> 00:52:55,075
Now, you look what you did,
you fucking creep.

593
00:52:55,115 --> 00:52:56,641
You fucking pissed off my girl!

594
00:53:06,698 --> 00:53:08,040
You okay?

595
00:53:09,451 --> 00:53:13,096
Fuck you, you fucking jock motherfuckers!

596
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:15,881
You fucking-- we don't need
your fucking cheer leading whores!

597
00:53:15,912 --> 00:53:18,343
You know why? Because we got
our own fucking whore

598
00:53:18,379 --> 00:53:22,089
and she's the sweetest one in the
whole fuckin town, you asshole.

599
00:53:22,123 --> 00:53:25,636
She's got fucking sweet
tits and she's fucking hot!

600
00:53:25,675 --> 00:53:27,748
- Wheeler, shut the fuck up.
- So fuck you!

601
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:30,089
She's our fucking sex slut!

602
00:53:40,141 --> 00:53:42,596
Shut the fuck up wheeler!

603
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,643
Johnny's going to take one
fucking look at this dead girl

604
00:53:44,685 --> 00:53:46,245
and he's going to turn around
and fucking bust us man.

605
00:53:46,284 --> 00:53:47,462
You understand that?

606
00:53:48,461 --> 00:53:50,184
If we don't fucking come up with something
right now,

607
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:53,635
- we're gonna fucking go to fucking jail, Wheeler.
- Rickie, man, I can't get to jail.

608
00:53:53,677 --> 00:53:56,841
My fuckin' mom's going to kill me...

609
00:53:56,877 --> 00:53:57,858
Stop! Stop! Look,

610
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,618
whatever happens,
we cannot show them the girl, okay?

611
00:54:00,653 --> 00:54:01,864
It can't happen.

612
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,749
We keep this between us
and you keep your mouth quiet, okay?

613
00:54:07,373 --> 00:54:09,348
Oh shit!

614
00:54:10,158 --> 00:54:11,467
All right little shits!

615
00:54:11,501 --> 00:54:13,356
Don't even think about
making a run for it.

616
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:16,424
Dwyer's got a baseball bat
and he's a fucking state champ.

617
00:54:23,277 --> 00:54:26,594
Come on you-- Listen, come on you guys.

618
00:54:26,637 --> 00:54:29,158
Wheeler was just fuckin' talkin' shit.
I swear to God, man.

619
00:54:29,198 --> 00:54:30,442
There's nothing down here.

620
00:54:30,478 --> 00:54:31,557
Talking shit?

621
00:54:31,597 --> 00:54:35,210
I guess Dwyer and I can stop fucking
around and kick your asses now, huh?

622
00:54:37,805 --> 00:54:39,399
Yeah.

623
00:54:39,438 --> 00:54:40,747
I guess you're gonna have to.

624
00:54:48,847 --> 00:54:50,091
Fuck you!

625
00:55:24,143 --> 00:55:25,288
I'm sorry.

626
00:55:35,953 --> 00:55:37,447
Jesus.

627
00:55:46,288 --> 00:55:47,532
What the fuck?

628
00:55:48,785 --> 00:55:52,527
See, she's right there just like I said.

629
00:55:56,592 --> 00:55:58,665
What the fuck is this?

630
00:55:58,704 --> 00:56:01,487
It's just what it looks like Dwyer.

631
00:56:01,522 --> 00:56:03,693
Hot-to-trot bitch with a yen for dick.

632
00:56:05,937 --> 00:56:07,399
JT.

633
00:56:09,394 --> 00:56:10,441
Johnny?

634
00:56:12,178 --> 00:56:19,336
So you boys decided to come by,
give our girlfriend a ride, huh?

635
00:56:19,378 --> 00:56:20,654
Uh, no.

636
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,599
We were just fucking with Wheeler, all right?

637
00:56:22,642 --> 00:56:24,465
I thought he was shitting us.

638
00:56:24,498 --> 00:56:27,313
Ain't no shitin' going on here, boy.

639
00:56:27,346 --> 00:56:29,615
What's going on here, JT?

640
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:34,353
Why she all tied up
and beat up and shit?

641
00:56:34,386 --> 00:56:39,569
Because that's the way she likes it, Dwyer.

642
00:56:39,602 --> 00:56:41,741
Rough!

643
00:56:41,779 --> 00:56:44,365
S&M!

644
00:56:45,907 --> 00:56:48,012
Ain't either of you seen any pornos before?

645
00:56:52,562 --> 00:56:54,025
That's the way we give it to her.

646
00:56:56,755 --> 00:56:59,689
You know, whips and chains and shit.

647
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:04,464
That's the way we give it to her.

648
00:57:05,651 --> 00:57:07,080
See, she's hot for it.

649
00:57:12,083 --> 00:57:14,026
You all want to...

650
00:57:14,068 --> 00:57:14,897
No, man.

651
00:57:14,933 --> 00:57:15,979
We're fine. Thanks.

652
00:57:18,004 --> 00:57:18,953
We're fine, Dwyer.

653
00:57:18,996 --> 00:57:20,108
Ain't going in there.

654
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:21,995
We should leave.

655
00:57:22,037 --> 00:57:27,248
2 red blooded all American studs
like you passing on a free pussy?

656
00:57:27,284 --> 00:57:28,298
Fuck you.

657
00:57:38,485 --> 00:57:40,045
I don't know.

658
00:57:44,756 --> 00:57:47,340
- C'omn, Johnny.
- What?

659
00:57:49,846 --> 00:57:50,925
What the fuck?

660
00:57:53,877 --> 00:57:55,154
Dwyer, no.

661
00:57:55,189 --> 00:57:56,782
Come on, Johnny.

662
00:57:56,822 --> 00:57:58,796
What are you doing?

663
00:57:58,837 --> 00:57:59,918
Don't leave me hanging here, man?

664
00:58:01,173 --> 00:58:03,344
What?

665
00:58:03,381 --> 00:58:06,644
What, and dip my wick in
a puddle of your spunk?

666
00:58:06,678 --> 00:58:09,329
I may be horny but I'm not desperate.

667
00:58:09,365 --> 00:58:10,859
Shoot.

668
00:58:12,086 --> 00:58:15,435
I got my own sweet pussy
waiting for me tonight.

669
00:58:27,926 --> 00:58:29,301
Yeah?

670
00:58:29,334 --> 00:58:30,764
Why don't you go for the mouth then?

671
00:58:34,903 --> 00:58:39,540
See, ah...

672
00:58:39,575 --> 00:58:41,582
she likes it any way she can get it,
Johnny boy.

673
00:58:52,183 --> 00:58:53,776
Come on, Johnny.

674
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:58,163
The water looks fine.

675
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,825
What?

676
00:59:03,064 --> 00:59:06,577
What's the matter, man? You're scared?

677
00:59:06,616 --> 00:59:08,176
Or is she out of your league?

678
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:11,218
I bet you Joann doesn't do that for you.

679
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,972
You know what, Johnny?
I bet you're full of shit.

680
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:16,627
I bet that you haven't had your
dick sucked your whole life.

681
00:59:16,664 --> 00:59:18,257
- I bet you never -
- Hey!

682
00:59:18,297 --> 00:59:19,955
Can't deny the lady, now, can we?

683
00:59:22,713 --> 00:59:24,852
You the man, Johnny.

684
00:59:24,889 --> 00:59:26,001
You the man.

685
00:59:32,089 --> 00:59:33,299
You the man.

686
01:00:15,162 --> 01:00:17,399
Come on baby. It's all right.

687
01:00:17,435 --> 01:00:19,322
It's not gonna bite you.

688
01:00:46,492 --> 01:00:47,604
Okay, man, that's enough.

689
01:00:47,643 --> 01:00:48,985
Yeah, get in line, fag.

690
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,546
Stop that.

691
01:00:54,395 --> 01:00:55,672
Oh shit!

692
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:59,003
Bitch, bitch, bitch...

693
01:01:03,357 --> 01:01:05,429
I'm taking him to the hospital.
Then, we're calling the cops.

694
01:01:05,469 --> 01:01:07,192
Oh, you're going to go to
the cops and tell them what?

695
01:01:07,228 --> 01:01:09,813
That you were raping a chick in
a mouth and she bit your dick?

696
01:01:09,852 --> 01:01:11,740
I wasn't raping her.
You said she wanted it.

697
01:01:11,773 --> 01:01:13,682
Yeah well, I'm sure they
heard that one before.

698
01:01:13,725 --> 01:01:14,805
- You said she liked it.
- Get off.

699
01:01:14,845 --> 01:01:18,969
Prove it in court when Johnny
boy here whips his dick out.

700
01:01:19,004 --> 01:01:21,525
Prove it when they show photos of her face.

701
01:01:21,565 --> 01:01:24,565
Don't forget about Joann, huh?
How are going to explain this to her?

702
01:01:24,605 --> 01:01:27,125
Well, gee, honey, I was just walking
through this abandoned mental hospital

703
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:30,101
and my weenie was hanging out and I tripped
and fell and guess where it ended up?

704
01:01:30,141 --> 01:01:32,280
That's bullshit. Look what she did to me!

705
01:01:32,317 --> 01:01:34,267
Yeah, well, all the blood's
been rushing down there.

706
01:01:34,302 --> 01:01:35,444
I tell you what though?

707
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:38,940
You hold off on sticking it to Joann for
a couple of weeks, you'll be all right as rain.

708
01:01:38,973 --> 01:01:42,487
You tell her you're saving your
strength for the state championships

709
01:01:42,526 --> 01:01:44,380
or whatever the fuck it is you do.

710
01:01:44,413 --> 01:01:47,097
- Fuck you, man.
- Go to the cops.

711
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:52,918
Send me and Rickie and
Wheeler to jail and yourselves.

712
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:55,958
See, you won't be fit to tackle a retard
with polio by the time you get out.

713
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:02,300
Me and the boys? Well, we'll miss a
couple of divorces, a handful of brats and

714
01:02:02,334 --> 01:02:05,204
about a million shifts at the gas station.

715
01:02:05,246 --> 01:02:08,792
See, jail is full of motherfuckers like us.

716
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:12,858
- We got nothing to lose.
- Please don't touch me.

717
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,416
- Get off me. Get off me.
- Now, you two leave.

718
01:02:15,455 --> 01:02:17,211
You're not going to get away with this, JT.

719
01:02:17,248 --> 01:02:18,621
"You're not going to get away with this, JT."

720
01:02:18,655 --> 01:02:20,892
Fuckin' stupid fuck. Get the fuck out of here.

721
01:02:20,928 --> 01:02:23,578
Fuck you, man! Fuck you!

722
01:02:28,479 --> 01:02:30,868
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to say anything.

723
01:02:30,912 --> 01:02:34,489
- And it just came out and -
- And, and stow it, Wheeler.

724
01:02:34,528 --> 01:02:35,903
You dumb fuck.

725
01:02:35,936 --> 01:02:37,911
Now at least they'll keep their mouth shut.
They see my point.

726
01:02:37,952 --> 01:02:39,294
We fucked up man.

727
01:02:39,329 --> 01:02:41,238
You are the reason why
Johnny came down here.

728
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,819
You are the reason why he got bit and it's
bad enough that those 2 mother fuckers

729
01:02:45,856 --> 01:02:49,085
came down here but look at that shit.

730
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,357
Look at it.

731
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:55,833
I'm not going to put a fucking bag
over her head just to get it up.

732
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:57,758
And you know what, Rickie?
You know what?

733
01:02:57,856 --> 01:03:01,021
Now, nobody gets what they want.

734
01:03:01,057 --> 01:03:02,170
Joann Skinner, man?

735
01:03:02,209 --> 01:03:04,380
What the fuck were you thinking?

736
01:03:04,416 --> 01:03:06,904
This is the best we're ever going to have.

737
01:03:06,944 --> 01:03:07,960
I can't fucking go to jail.

738
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:08,982
You're not going to jail!

739
01:03:09,025 --> 01:03:10,454
You're gonna get the fuck out of here!

740
01:03:10,497 --> 01:03:11,518
You're gonna go home and
you're gonna go to bed.

741
01:03:11,553 --> 01:03:12,701
You're gonna wake up tomorrow.

742
01:03:12,736 --> 01:03:15,837
You're going to school and you're gonna
pretend like none of this shit ever happened.

743
01:03:15,873 --> 01:03:18,077
So, get the fuck out right now.

744
01:03:18,114 --> 01:03:19,226
Go!

745
01:03:21,314 --> 01:03:22,491
You know what?
You get the fuck out too.

746
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:24,188
You're not the
fucking boss of this shit.

747
01:03:24,225 --> 01:03:27,226
You are disinvited from
my fucking basement, Rick.

748
01:03:27,266 --> 01:03:28,574
You fucked up.

749
01:03:48,994 --> 01:03:50,238
Joann.

750
01:03:50,273 --> 01:03:52,445
Rickie, what are you doing here?

751
01:03:52,483 --> 01:03:55,264
Look, listen.

752
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:58,812
There's this really, really
fucked-up situation with Johnny.

753
01:03:58,851 --> 01:04:00,866
Okay, he's an asshole.
Okay, I know.

754
01:04:00,899 --> 01:04:04,957
I know.
And after tonight he'll leave you alone.

755
01:04:04,995 --> 01:04:06,172
No, he won't.

756
01:04:08,226 --> 01:04:10,235
He's my boyfriend.

757
01:04:10,275 --> 01:04:13,177
You're just going to have to deal.

758
01:04:13,218 --> 01:04:15,521
Joann, he doesn't fucking love you.

759
01:04:17,732 --> 01:04:23,328
Listen, listen, I just...
whatever you hear after tonight, okay,

760
01:04:23,364 --> 01:04:27,325
I want you to know I tried to fucking stop it.

761
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,851
You have to believe me.

762
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,843
This is weird.

763
01:04:34,884 --> 01:04:38,147
- I, ah -
- Will you just listen to me, please.

764
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:44,639
- No, what if someone sees us or -
- What if someone sees us, huh?

765
01:04:44,677 --> 01:04:48,605
What if someone sees us?

766
01:04:48,644 --> 01:04:50,205
Look, who fucking cares?

767
01:05:27,078 --> 01:05:28,126
I hope she's hot.

768
01:05:32,518 --> 01:05:35,999
Whoever it is you boys are fightin' over,

769
01:05:36,038 --> 01:05:38,405
you're taking a real beating for her.
Jesus Christ, man.

770
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:50,369
You gotta just try and relax, man.
You know?

771
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:52,262
Have fun.

772
01:05:53,639 --> 01:05:55,298
I tell ya.

773
01:05:58,695 --> 01:06:02,722
I really wish I was 15 again.

774
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:05,409
I'm 17.

775
01:06:05,447 --> 01:06:07,335
Man, do I wish I was 15 again.

776
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:49,286
- Do you think they told anybody?
- I don't know, man.

777
01:06:49,321 --> 01:06:52,452
I think we'd be in a heap of
shit right about now if they did.

778
01:06:52,488 --> 01:06:56,962
Look, just stay cool, Wheeler, alright?
They're not going to do anything, man.

779
01:06:57,002 --> 01:07:00,067
I'm cool, okay?

780
01:07:00,106 --> 01:07:02,047
Thank God for JT, you know?

781
01:07:02,089 --> 01:07:03,365
JT?

782
01:07:03,401 --> 01:07:04,808
You're fucking kidding me, man?

783
01:07:04,842 --> 01:07:07,263
If it weren't for fucking JT, none would this
would have happened in the first place.

784
01:07:07,306 --> 01:07:11,299
Hey, that's no way to be
talking about friends, man.

785
01:07:11,337 --> 01:07:15,266
I should have fucking torched the
whole building the night we found her man.

786
01:07:15,306 --> 01:07:16,833
She's just a dead girl, man.

787
01:07:17,578 --> 01:07:18,593
That's all.

788
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:20,674
You know what, Wheeler?
Just leave me the fuck alone, man.

789
01:07:21,931 --> 01:07:22,792
Rickie.

790
01:07:23,753 --> 01:07:24,702
Rickie.

791
01:07:24,746 --> 01:07:25,542
Hey!

792
01:07:25,578 --> 01:07:28,741
We got to... we got to stick together.

793
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:05,546
Hold still, baby.

794
01:08:07,179 --> 01:08:08,521
I'm trying to fix you up.

795
01:08:26,093 --> 01:08:27,369
Easy.

796
01:08:28,684 --> 01:08:29,797
Don't you fuckin' bite her.

797
01:08:44,685 --> 01:08:46,955
I guess we don't have to
worry about that mutt no more.

798
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:13,447
...sold by date, In order to avoid spoilage which
can lead to serious illness. And of course meat,

799
01:09:13,486 --> 01:09:17,764
rotten meat in particular when
left unrefrigerated can be toxic.

800
01:09:17,806 --> 01:09:21,865
But I'm sure everybody here is very
familiar with the safety issues

801
01:09:21,902 --> 01:09:23,975
concerning poorly kept perishables.

802
01:09:25,486 --> 01:09:27,374
Johnny, think fast.

803
01:09:30,447 --> 01:09:37,125
- Some examples of perishables are -
- What's that smell?

804
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,629
Oh, my God...

805
01:11:26,995 --> 01:11:29,200
Nice of you to visit.

806
01:11:29,235 --> 01:11:31,820
So, I was expecting someone else.

807
01:11:31,859 --> 01:11:33,233
Fuck you, man.

808
01:11:33,267 --> 01:11:38,220
Johnny's...I don't know what this chick's got
but she's fucking coming with me to the hospital

809
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:39,470
and then we're going to the cops, man.

810
01:11:39,508 --> 01:11:41,330
I've been fucking her for days.

811
01:11:41,364 --> 01:11:42,890
So has Wheeler.

812
01:11:42,932 --> 01:11:44,819
So did you.

813
01:11:44,851 --> 01:11:48,561
Stand back JT.
I'm taking her with me.

814
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:50,221
- There ain't nothing wrong with her.
- Bullshit.

815
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:52,529
Johnny's got his guts stuck back
into him and he's starting to smell

816
01:11:52,564 --> 01:11:54,571
like fucking rotten meat, okay?

817
01:11:54,612 --> 01:12:01,650
He's starting to...
he's starting to smell like her.

818
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:03,375
- She bit him.
- No shit she bit him.

819
01:12:03,413 --> 01:12:04,525
Now stand the fuck back.

820
01:12:04,564 --> 01:12:06,572
I'm taking her with me.

821
01:12:06,612 --> 01:12:09,165
You don't need to do that.

822
01:12:09,205 --> 01:12:11,506
See, Johnny's dead.

823
01:12:13,397 --> 01:12:14,706
Fuck you, man.

824
01:12:14,742 --> 01:12:16,749
Johnny is not dead.

825
01:12:16,789 --> 01:12:18,415
Johnny's dead.

826
01:12:27,061 --> 01:12:29,331
You don't get it, do ya?

827
01:12:29,365 --> 01:12:32,497
Johnny is dead.

828
01:12:32,533 --> 01:12:35,729
This bitch is dead.

829
01:12:35,765 --> 01:12:36,910
Now, you're dead too.

830
01:12:39,638 --> 01:12:40,532
You're fucking nuts, man.

831
01:12:40,566 --> 01:12:42,321
You're fucking nuts.

832
01:12:49,461 --> 01:12:53,652
You'll like being dead.

833
01:12:53,686 --> 01:12:56,753
Dead girl likes it. Don't you?

834
01:13:01,175 --> 01:13:03,444
Didn't know what I was going to do
after you boys messed her up.

835
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:06,828
But now I know, one bite from
her and I can make another.

836
01:13:06,871 --> 01:13:10,002
What...just get off there.

837
01:14:17,784 --> 01:14:19,573
My name is Kim.

838
01:14:19,609 --> 01:14:21,580
- How old are you Kim?
- 25.

839
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:23,655
Do you have a boyfriend or a husband?
How long are we going to wait here?

840
01:14:23,673 --> 01:14:26,194
I thought you said that we were just going to
come here and we're just going to like fucking get-

841
01:14:26,233 --> 01:14:27,695
Look, we're going to stay here

842
01:14:27,738 --> 01:14:29,974
until the right fucking one comes along.

843
01:14:30,009 --> 01:14:32,398
All right. We still got a few hours.

844
01:14:32,441 --> 01:14:35,289
I ain't just going to settle for the first
fucking thing that walks by man.

845
01:14:48,218 --> 01:14:49,909
Okay.

846
01:14:49,946 --> 01:14:52,336
Look at that ass.

847
01:14:52,379 --> 01:14:53,557
- You see that?
- Yeah, I see that.

848
01:14:53,595 --> 01:14:54,806
I can't fucking miss that.

849
01:14:54,843 --> 01:14:57,745
There's enough fucking cottage cheese
spilling out there to feed Ethiopia.

850
01:14:57,787 --> 01:14:59,216
No bro, it ain't that bad at all.

851
01:14:59,259 --> 01:15:02,969
Ain't that bad, ain't good enough.
Jesus, Wheeler.

852
01:15:03,003 --> 01:15:06,320
Look man, hey, this might be our
only fucking chance, okay?

853
01:15:06,363 --> 01:15:09,462
She's the only piece of split tail
that come by the last hour, all right?

854
01:15:09,499 --> 01:15:11,125
Look at her jugs, man?

855
01:15:11,163 --> 01:15:12,472
Fucking hot, right?

856
01:15:14,939 --> 01:15:16,215
True.

857
01:15:16,251 --> 01:15:17,266
All right.

858
01:15:17,307 --> 01:15:19,511
Look, that's the best we're going
to get out here, all right?

859
01:15:21,052 --> 01:15:22,066
Let's do it, all right? All right.

860
01:15:22,107 --> 01:15:23,188
All right.

861
01:15:23,228 --> 01:15:24,853
All right. Fine, fine, fine.

862
01:15:24,892 --> 01:15:26,834
Just wait till she comes out.

863
01:15:26,876 --> 01:15:28,153
Alright I'm going in.

864
01:15:35,997 --> 01:15:37,688
Don't look at me.

865
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:44,092
Hey, we've got some fuckin' cheap weed.

866
01:15:44,124 --> 01:15:45,815
You want weed or not?

867
01:15:46,077 --> 01:15:48,378
Really taking a step down, aren't I?

868
01:15:48,407 --> 01:15:49,688
Smell it.
Love it.

869
01:15:49,725 --> 01:15:50,870
It's wonderful.

870
01:15:55,261 --> 01:15:56,155
Where is it?

871
01:15:56,189 --> 01:15:57,400
Uh, it's in the trunk.

872
01:16:04,446 --> 01:16:05,591
Okay.

873
01:16:06,749 --> 01:16:10,098
Yo, JT! The trunk, bro.

874
01:16:10,142 --> 01:16:11,997
JT, the trunk, buddy.

875
01:16:12,029 --> 01:16:13,655
And I ain't giving you nothin' till I seen it.

876
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:16,023
Yeah. And it better be good.

877
01:16:16,062 --> 01:16:18,396
I know good when I see it.

878
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:21,212
So don't be trying to pass off no oregano
on me, you little motherfuckers.

879
01:16:24,798 --> 01:16:26,489
What's wrong with your buddy here?

880
01:16:26,527 --> 01:16:28,348
Slow or something?

881
01:16:31,262 --> 01:16:33,150
Well, I don't see nothing.

882
01:16:33,183 --> 01:16:34,328
Well, here baby.

883
01:17:18,368 --> 01:17:20,223
Sons of bitches...

884
01:17:20,256 --> 01:17:22,143
Fuck you!

885
01:17:26,816 --> 01:17:29,718
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Shit!

886
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:30,872
You all right?

887
01:17:37,857 --> 01:17:40,128
- You okay? You okay?
- Am I okay?

888
01:17:40,193 --> 01:17:42,582
No, I'm not okay.

889
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:44,729
Not fucking funny, man.

890
01:17:44,769 --> 01:17:46,198
You want a tough bitch...

891
01:17:46,242 --> 01:17:47,834
Wasn't she a fuckin' tough bitch.

892
01:17:47,874 --> 01:17:50,175
She fuckin' outweighed us both.

893
01:17:50,209 --> 01:17:51,551
No fuck you.

894
01:17:51,585 --> 01:17:54,367
I didn't even want her to begin with,
you dumb piece of shit...

895
01:17:54,401 --> 01:17:55,480
There you are!

896
01:17:57,762 --> 01:17:59,322
Hey, Joann.

897
01:17:59,361 --> 01:18:02,590
I want to know what the fuck you did
to my boyfriend?

898
01:18:02,626 --> 01:18:03,673
No, you don't.

899
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:08,599
Just fucking tell me.

900
01:18:14,786 --> 01:18:16,858
Why don't we just show you?

901
01:19:41,413 --> 01:19:43,301
Joann.

902
01:19:43,334 --> 01:19:44,195
Okay.

903
01:19:44,230 --> 01:19:45,921
- It's going to be okay.
- Rickie don't leave me.

904
01:19:45,957 --> 01:19:47,933
I'm going to get you out of here okay.
I'm going to get you out of here.

905
01:19:47,974 --> 01:19:49,282
All right.

906
01:19:51,365 --> 01:19:53,822
Fuck you!
Your fucking friends kidnapped me.

907
01:19:53,861 --> 01:19:55,236
I fucking stood up for you.

908
01:19:55,269 --> 01:19:56,579
I fucking did everything.

909
01:19:56,614 --> 01:19:57,475
- Fuck you.
- Quit fighting me.

910
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:58,622
- Quit fighting me, OK?
- No!

911
01:19:58,662 --> 01:20:00,004
Look, I'm here to help you.

912
01:20:00,038 --> 01:20:02,689
I'd never hurt you.
I'd never hurt you.

913
01:20:02,726 --> 01:20:04,614
I'm here to help you.

914
01:20:04,647 --> 01:20:08,127
You're here to what, Rick?

915
01:20:12,678 --> 01:20:18,014
You're here to save
the damsel in distress?

916
01:20:18,054 --> 01:20:20,640
Be the big hero?

917
01:20:20,678 --> 01:20:26,658
Nah, that can't be.
We all know you ain't no hero.

918
01:20:26,695 --> 01:20:29,084
JT, what the fuck is she doing down here, man?

919
01:20:29,127 --> 01:20:31,778
Dead girl, Rick.

920
01:20:31,815 --> 01:20:33,091
We can make more.

921
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,669
See, all she's got to do is
take one bite out of you and...

922
01:20:44,232 --> 01:20:45,693
JT figured it out.

923
01:20:49,831 --> 01:20:52,733
Look, I don't know what the
fuck is going on around here

924
01:20:52,775 --> 01:20:54,815
but it has nothing to do with me.

925
01:20:54,856 --> 01:21:00,126
Sweetheart, I think it's got just about
everything to do with you, doesn't it?

926
01:21:04,136 --> 01:21:07,005
Think about it.

927
01:21:07,049 --> 01:21:11,173
Folks like us are just cannon fodder
for the rest of the world.

928
01:21:11,208 --> 01:21:14,820
But down here, you see we're in control.

929
01:21:14,856 --> 01:21:19,046
Now, we call the shots down here, man.

930
01:21:19,081 --> 01:21:20,969
Feels good, doesn't it?

931
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:23,936
It's all right to say.

932
01:21:23,977 --> 01:21:28,484
You don't have to be the
nice guy down here, Rickie.

933
01:21:28,521 --> 01:21:30,790
Yeah, man. This is all for you.

934
01:21:30,825 --> 01:21:35,614
Enough with the goddamned
lights already, Wheeler.

935
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:39,455
Even if you did save her, Rick,
whaddya think she's gonna do?

936
01:21:46,794 --> 01:21:50,307
JT man, please just let her go.

937
01:21:50,346 --> 01:21:53,729
You sure that's what you want?

938
01:21:53,770 --> 01:21:54,948
Please.

939
01:21:54,986 --> 01:22:00,256
Is that really what you want?

940
01:22:00,298 --> 01:22:01,728
She sure is beautiful.

941
01:22:01,771 --> 01:22:03,680
- Fuck yeah, she is.
- All right, Wheeler. All right.

942
01:22:03,722 --> 01:22:08,610
I'm talking to Rickie now, please.

943
01:22:08,651 --> 01:22:11,967
JT, man just don't fucking make
me do this, okay?

944
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:13,636
Look, I get it.

945
01:22:13,674 --> 01:22:17,351
All right. You don't want to share
and that's understandable.

946
01:22:17,387 --> 01:22:18,315
I respect it.

947
01:22:18,347 --> 01:22:20,453
You want what should have
been yours a long time ago

948
01:22:20,491 --> 01:22:22,596
and that's what I'm trying to do for you.

949
01:22:22,636 --> 01:22:27,240
I'm doing this for your benefit, Rick.

950
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:29,218
She's all yours.

951
01:22:34,123 --> 01:22:37,025
Wait, who the fuck is that?

952
01:22:37,067 --> 01:22:38,115
Don't you worry about her, honey.

953
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:41,674
JT.

954
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,803
Who the fuck is that?

955
01:22:49,835 --> 01:22:52,553
You've got me all wrong, man.

956
01:22:52,588 --> 01:22:56,036
Do I?

957
01:22:56,076 --> 01:23:00,386
No. I'm thinking I know you a little bit better
than you even know yourself these days, Rickie.

958
01:23:01,421 --> 01:23:03,013
Then you know I'm fucking
done with you, man.

959
01:23:03,053 --> 01:23:05,354
Rickie, she is going to send us to jail.

960
01:23:05,389 --> 01:23:10,572
And you ain't going to
have her or anybody else.

961
01:23:10,605 --> 01:23:11,881
- No.
- You know it's got to be done.

962
01:23:11,916 --> 01:23:15,364
Enough with the goddamned
machete already, okay?

963
01:23:18,605 --> 01:23:20,295
Wheeler, what are you doing?

964
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:22,438
Wheeler, what the fuck are you doing?

965
01:23:22,477 --> 01:23:25,543
Wheeler, don't you fucking touch her, man.

966
01:23:25,582 --> 01:23:29,029
Don't you fucking touch her, Wheeler,
I swear to fucking God!

967
01:23:29,069 --> 01:23:30,499
- You won't believe it.
- Wheeler I wouldn't.

968
01:23:30,542 --> 01:23:33,389
Wheeler don't you fucking touch her.

969
01:23:33,422 --> 01:23:34,534
That's a bad idea man.

970
01:23:34,574 --> 01:23:37,159
Don't you fucking touch her!

971
01:23:48,975 --> 01:23:51,341
What'd you do that for?

972
01:24:03,983 --> 01:24:11,785
Well, you sure picked a pretty
shit poor time to man up, Rick.

973
01:24:11,823 --> 01:24:14,573
Who you trying to be anyway, man?

974
01:24:14,607 --> 01:24:19,212
Since day one, it's been you and me.

975
01:24:19,247 --> 01:24:23,623
It's been JT and Rickie all the way, man.

976
01:24:23,664 --> 01:24:25,038
And we don't change.

977
01:24:25,072 --> 01:24:27,854
We don't have to change
because it's us, man.

978
01:24:27,887 --> 01:24:31,849
Rickie and JT, man.

979
01:24:31,888 --> 01:24:33,262
Nothing's got to change between us.

980
01:24:33,296 --> 01:24:36,198
Nobody's got to change, you know.

981
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:37,647
It's just you and me, right?

982
01:24:43,217 --> 01:24:44,329
Joann Skinner, man?

983
01:24:44,369 --> 01:24:51,374
You think she's going to
choose you in the real world?

984
01:24:51,408 --> 01:24:57,770
In the real world,
she'd rather die than be with you.

985
01:24:57,809 --> 01:25:01,191
Yeah.

986
01:25:01,233 --> 01:25:02,160
I know.

987
01:25:13,938 --> 01:25:16,655
Rickie, man, just you and me, right?

988
01:25:25,618 --> 01:25:27,472
I'm not feeling so good, man.

989
01:25:27,506 --> 01:25:29,775
He cut off your fucking hand, man.

990
01:25:31,026 --> 01:25:33,579
I'm not feelin' too good, man.

991
01:25:40,627 --> 01:25:42,441
Oh shit!
Jesus!

992
01:25:44,051 --> 01:25:45,578
Help me!

993
01:25:51,827 --> 01:25:53,288
Rickie. Rickie!

994
01:25:59,283 --> 01:26:01,290
Wheeler, I'm sorry, man,
but she bite you, man.

995
01:26:01,331 --> 01:26:04,944
This ain't my fault. I'm sorry.
I got to, Wheeler, I got to.

996
01:26:14,675 --> 01:26:16,333
- Somebody help!
- Calm down!

997
01:26:16,372 --> 01:26:18,282
Somebody help! No!

998
01:26:18,323 --> 01:26:21,041
Somebody help!

999
01:26:21,076 --> 01:26:23,498
- Please.
- No, calm down Joann.

1000
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:24,968
- Get off of me!
- It's not going to go in the open!

1001
01:26:25,012 --> 01:26:26,506
- No please!
- It's not going to fucking open!

1002
01:26:26,549 --> 01:26:28,523
- Hold on!
- No!

1003
01:26:28,565 --> 01:26:31,085
- Help Please!
- Calm down.

1004
01:26:31,124 --> 01:26:32,618
Calm down.

1005
01:26:37,301 --> 01:26:39,538
Why the fuck don't you
fucking listen to me.

1006
01:26:39,572 --> 01:26:42,921
I try to fucking be good to you!
Just fucking listen to me for one second!

1007
01:26:42,965 --> 01:26:47,472
Joann, please fucking pay
attention to me for once.

1008
01:26:47,509 --> 01:26:48,457
Fuck!

1009
01:26:48,501 --> 01:26:49,963
Fuck.

1010
01:26:50,837 --> 01:26:51,982
Shit.

1011
01:26:55,350 --> 01:26:57,041
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1012
01:26:57,076 --> 01:26:58,418
I'm fucking sorry, okay?

1013
01:26:58,453 --> 01:26:59,533
I'm so sorry.

1014
01:26:59,573 --> 01:27:02,029
Sorry. Sorry.

1015
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:02,931
It's okay.

1016
01:27:02,965 --> 01:27:04,340
Alright, so I'm gonna get you out of here.

1017
01:27:04,373 --> 01:27:05,486
Alright, I promise.

1018
01:27:05,525 --> 01:27:06,802
I promise.

1019
01:27:16,246 --> 01:27:17,555
Fuck. Fuck!

1020
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:26,097
It's okay. It's okay.

1021
01:27:31,126 --> 01:27:32,336
Hang on, okay? I'll be right back.

1022
01:27:32,375 --> 01:27:34,447
There might be a fucking way out.
Now hold on.

1023
01:27:41,559 --> 01:27:42,540
Shit.

1024
01:27:44,119 --> 01:27:45,460
Fuck.

1025
01:29:13,371 --> 01:29:15,792
He stabbed me.

1026
01:29:15,834 --> 01:29:17,394
Rickie.

1027
01:29:20,443 --> 01:29:22,515
Oh God.

1028
01:29:24,955 --> 01:29:27,443
Fuck JT, why did you do this, man?

1029
01:29:27,483 --> 01:29:28,345
Why?

1030
01:29:30,043 --> 01:29:31,636
Why did you do it, man?

1031
01:29:31,675 --> 01:29:33,137
JT, what the fuck?

1032
01:29:39,163 --> 01:29:41,203
Shit!

1033
01:29:41,243 --> 01:29:43,893
I was just trying to help, Rickie.

1034
01:29:46,716 --> 01:29:47,893
Hold still. Just breathe.

1035
01:29:47,932 --> 01:29:49,972
I'm gonna get you outta here. Hold on.

1036
01:29:50,012 --> 01:29:51,059
Okay.

1037
01:29:51,099 --> 01:29:52,725
Breathe. It will be okay, okay?

1038
01:29:52,763 --> 01:29:54,007
I'll get you out of here.

1039
01:29:54,044 --> 01:29:55,734
Just don't tell my grandma, okay?

1040
01:30:01,244 --> 01:30:03,764
Rickie, I can feel it inside me.

1041
01:30:03,804 --> 01:30:05,910
Don't worry I'm not going to let you.

1042
01:30:05,948 --> 01:30:06,962
I'm going to get you out of here.

1043
01:30:07,004 --> 01:30:08,313
It will be all right. I'll get you out of here.

1044
01:30:13,757 --> 01:30:15,033
I won't let you die, Joann.

1045
01:30:15,069 --> 01:30:17,654
I won't let you die.

1046
01:30:17,692 --> 01:30:19,962
What did you say?

1047
01:30:19,996 --> 01:30:21,785
I said that I love you.

1048
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:23,892
I love you, Joann, so much.

1049
01:30:26,812 --> 01:30:28,917
Rickie.

1050
01:30:28,957 --> 01:30:30,965
I can still bite her before it's too late.

1051
01:30:32,573 --> 01:30:34,994
Listen, I love you.

1052
01:30:37,661 --> 01:30:39,549
I do. I love you.

1053
01:30:39,582 --> 01:30:41,108
I love you, Joann.

1054
01:30:43,613 --> 01:30:47,029
Fucking grow up.

1055

1056
01:31:08,574 --> 01:31:12,120
Take me home, Rickie.

1057
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:13,719
Please.

1058
01:31:19,551 --> 01:31:22,300
God please help me.
