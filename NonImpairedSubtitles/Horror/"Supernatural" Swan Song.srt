Michael's vessel.

- Lucifer.

- Castiel: The angels took him.

- No, no, no, no, no.

161
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:09,366
As if I'm just gonna
let you rot in there.

162
00:08:09,434 --> 00:08:10,834
Yeah, you are.
You don't have a choice.

163
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:11,969
You can't ask me to do this.

164
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:14,170
I'm sorry, Dean.
You <i>have</i> to.

165
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:18,908
So then what am I
supposed to do?

166
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:21,445
You go find Lisa.
[scoffs]

167
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:23,446
You pray to God she's
dumb enough to take you in,

168
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:27,616
and you... you have barbecues
and go to football games.

169
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:30,853
You go live some normal,
apple-pie life, Dean.

170
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,556
Promise me.

171
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:54,609
Bobby: Demons.

172
00:08:54,676 --> 00:08:56,443
At least two dozen of them.

173
00:08:56,511 --> 00:08:57,911
You were right... something's up.

174
00:08:57,979 --> 00:08:59,813
More than something.

175
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:01,382
He's here, I know it.

176
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,457
[sighs]

177
00:09:14,395 --> 00:09:16,529
[sighs]

178
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:23,202
I'll see ya around, kid.

179
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,670
See ya around.

180
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:37,249
He gets in...

181
00:09:37,316 --> 00:09:39,851
you fight him tooth and nail,
you understand?

182
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,521
Keep swingin', don't give an inch.

183
00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:44,754
Yes, sir.

184
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:48,492
[sighs heavily]

185
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:57,167
You take care of these guys, okay?

186
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:00,936
[sighs lightly]
That's not possible.

187
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:03,739
[chuckles]

188
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:05,975
Then humor me.

189
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:08,077
Oh, I was supposed to lie.

190
00:10:08,144 --> 00:10:09,411
[chuckles]

191
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:11,613
Uh...

192
00:10:11,681 --> 00:10:13,748
Sure. They'll be fine. I...

193
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:16,750
Just...
just stop... talking.

194
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:20,322
[sighs]

195
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,701
You mind not watching this?

196
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,848
[breathing heavily]

197
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,420
Okay.

198
00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:55,054
Let's go.

199
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,231
All right!

200
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:07,633
We're here,
you sons of bitches!

201
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,801
Come and get it!

202
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,939
Hey, guys.

203
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,441
Is your father home?

204
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:19,277
[grunting]

205
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,218
Hey, guys.

206
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:30,020
So nice of you to drop in.

207
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:40,130
Chuck:
<i>The Impala, of course,</i>

208
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:42,098

<i>other cars have...</i>

209
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,033
<i>and a few things they</i> don't.

210
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:46,936
<i>But none of that stuff's</i>

211

214
00:11:54,711 --> 00:11:57,112

00:12:03,352 --> 00:12:05,754

223
00:12:21,437 --> 00:12:23,271
Sorry if it's a bit chilly.

224
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:26,374
Most people think I burn hot.

225
00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:29,010
It's actually quite the opposite.

226
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:30,644
Well, I'll alert the media.

227
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:40,120
Help me understand something,
guys.

228
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:41,921
I mean, stomping through
my front door

229
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,892
is... a tad suicidal,
don't you think?

230
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,594
We're not here to fight you.

231
00:12:47,661 --> 00:12:48,794
No?

232
00:12:48,862 --> 00:12:51,962
- Then why are you?
- I want to say "yes."

233
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,932
Excuse me?

234

[inhales sharply]

235
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:03,909
Chock-full of Ovaltine, are we?

236
00:13:03,977 --> 00:13:05,510
You heard me.

237
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:06,511
Yes.

238
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,613
You're serious.

239
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,419
Look, judgment day's
a runaway train.

240
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:16,321
We get it now,
we just want off.

241
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:17,322
Meaning?

242
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,991
Deal of the century.

243
00:13:20,058 --> 00:13:22,792
I give you a free ride,
but when it's all over,

244
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,562
I live, he lives,
you bring our parents back...

245
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,564
Okay, can we please
drop the Telenovela?

246
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:31,001
I know you have the rings, Sam.

247
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:37,206
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

248
00:13:38,842 --> 00:13:42,111
The Horsemen's rings?

249
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:45,548
The magic keys to my cage?

250
00:13:45,615 --> 00:13:48,518
Ring a bell?

251
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:50,920
Come on, Sam.
I've never lied to you.

252
00:13:50,987 --> 00:13:53,522
You could at least
pay me the same respect.

253
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:58,060
It's okay. I'm not mad.

254
00:13:58,127 --> 00:14:00,828
A wrestling match
inside your noggin...

255
00:14:00,896 --> 00:14:02,997
I like the idea.

256
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:07,602
Just you and me,
one round, no tricks.

257
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,337
You win, you jump in the hole.

258
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:12,173
<i>I</i> win...

259
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,008
well, then I win.

260
00:14:15,077 --> 00:14:17,545
What do you say, Sam?

261
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:19,813
A fiddle of gold
against your soul

262
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:21,915
[singsong voice]
says I'm better than you-ou.

263
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,188
So he knows.
Doesn't change anything.

264
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:29,989
Sam.

265
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:32,724
- We don't have any other choice.
- No.

266
00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:36,229
Yes.

- Dean!
- Sammy!

00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:22,005
I can feel him.

- Oh, God!
- You got to go now!

274

Come on!

276
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:30,112
Go now, Sammy.

Now!

00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:52,800
I was just messing with you.

280
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,970
Sammy's long gone.

I told you...

284
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:35,640
this would always happen
in Detroit.

285
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,336
Sam.

286
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:07,503
Come on.

287
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:08,705
[sighs]

288
00:17:08,772 --> 00:17:10,873
I can feel you...

scratching away in there.

290
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:19,914
Look...

291
00:17:19,982 --> 00:17:22,083
I'll take the gag off, okay?

292
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,290
You got me all wrong, kiddo.

293
00:17:29,358 --> 00:17:30,924
[panting]

294
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:32,293
I'm not the bad guy here.

295
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:34,962
I'm gonna rip you apart
from the inside out.

296
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,597
Do you understand me?

young Skywalker.

300

Who are you <i>really</i>
<i>angry with?</i>

301
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:50,543
Me?

302
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,279
Or that face in the mirror?

303
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:54,781
I'm sure this is all
a big joke to you, huh?

304
00:17:54,848 --> 00:17:55,882
Not at all.

305
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,550
I've been waiting for you...

00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:02,053
for a long, <i>long</i> time.

Come on, Sam.

308
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:06,057
You have to admit...

309
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,827
you can feel it, right?

310
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:11,428
- What?
- The exhilaration.

311
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:13,532
And you know why that is?

312
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,668
Because we're two halves
made whole.

313

M.F.E.O.

314
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:19,537
Literally.

315
00:18:19,605 --> 00:18:22,640
This feels
pretty damn far from good.

316
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,777
I'm inside
your grapefruit, Sam.

317
00:18:25,844 --> 00:18:29,046
You can't lie to me.

318
00:18:29,114 --> 00:18:30,981
I see it all.

319
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:33,950
How odd you always felt,

320
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:38,021
how... out of place

321
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:40,457
in that... family of yours.

322
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:44,994
And why shouldn't you have?

323
00:18:45,062 --> 00:18:47,163
They were foster care... at best.

324

And I know you know it.

All those times you ran away,

You don't have to be mean.

366
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:40,135
So what do we do now?

367
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:47,509
I suggest we imbibe
copious quantities of alcohol.

368

And why make us fight?

We were together.
We were happy.

511
00:27:43,977 --> 00:27:45,878
But you betrayed me,
all of us...

<i>This is the last Dean and Bobby</i>
<i>will see of each other</i>

652
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,945
<i>for a very long time.</i>

653
00:38:52,517 --> 00:38:54,918
<i>And for the record...</i>
<i>at this point next week,</i>

654
00:38:54,987 --> 00:38:57,921
<i>Bobby will be hunting a Rugaru</i>
<i>outside of Dayton.</i>

655
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,723
<i>But not Dean.</i>

656
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:01,924
<i>Dean didn't want Cass</i>
<i>to save him.</i>

657
00:39:01,993 --> 00:39:04,160
<i>Every part of him,</i>
<i>every fiber he's got,</i>

658
00:39:04,228 --> 00:39:05,895
<i>wants to die...</i>

659
00:39:05,963 --> 00:39:08,164
<i>or find a way</i>
<i>to bring Sam back.</i>

660
00:39:08,232 --> 00:39:10,300
<i>But he isn't gonna do either.</i>

661
00:39:10,368 --> 00:39:12,735
<i>Because he made a promise.</i>

662
00:39:18,308 --> 00:39:19,608
[door creaks]

663
00:39:21,811 --> 00:39:23,512
[voice breaking] Hey, Lisa.

664
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:26,382
Oh, thank God.

665
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:27,749
Are you all right?

666
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:33,154
Yeah.

667
00:39:33,222 --> 00:39:35,990
Uh, if it's not too late, I...

668
00:39:36,058 --> 00:39:38,592
think I'd like
to take you up on that beer.

669
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,031
It's never too late.

670
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:52,805
It's okay.

671
00:39:52,873 --> 00:39:55,608
It's gonna be okay.

672
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,115
<i>So, what's it all add up to?</i>

673
00:40:02,183 --> 00:40:04,150
<i>It's hard to say.</i>

674
00:40:04,217 --> 00:40:06,885
<i>But me,</i>
<i>I'd say this</i> was <i>a test...</i>

675
00:40:06,953 --> 00:40:09,088
<i>for Sam and Dean.</i>

676
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,424
<i>And I think they did all right.</i>

677
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:14,293
<i>Up against good, evil,</i>

678
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:19,198
<i>angels, devils, destiny</i>
<i>and God himself.</i>

679
00:40:19,266 --> 00:40:22,033
<i>They made their own choice.</i>

680
00:40:22,101 --> 00:40:24,569
<i>They chose family.</i>

681
00:40:24,636 --> 00:40:26,971
<i>And, well...</i>

682
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:29,541
<i>isn't that</i>
<i>kinda the whole point?</i>

683
00:40:36,114 --> 00:40:38,715
<i>No doubt... endings are hard,</i>

684
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:41,918
<i>but then again...</i>

685
00:40:41,986 --> 00:40:45,021
<i>nothing ever really ends,</i>
<i>does it?</i>

686
00:40:57,134 --> 00:40:59,268
You okay?

687
00:40:59,336 --> 00:41:01,471
Yeah, I'm good.

688
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:38,718
