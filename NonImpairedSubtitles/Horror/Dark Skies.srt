 I will look for ways to make it back to health.

 Caring for lizards, he said.
Do not know whether it's torture or affection. </ Font>

10
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,510
 I would choose the latter.
Do you like cheese? </ Font>

 Yes.

 Yes, also with Rat-Face (rat face).

Rat-Face (rat face). Do not be cruel. </ Font>

 Do not cruel?
This is a description. </ Font>

 Is there something wrong with that boy.

 We are expecting visitors,
back home soon. 

18
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,982
 An epic game
Modern Warfare?

19
00:03:04,636 --> 00:03:07,548
 Okay, I'm going home.
Ask them to relax. 

20
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,596
 God, this is weak, man. 

21
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,155
 I've done this
several times.

 FBI closes
private clubs in DC 

23

 all they do is increase
coffee prices in California. 

24
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,278
 Alicia told me.
He turned away. 

25
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,436
 I can not even
imagine their parents. 

26
00:04:18,037 --> 00:04:20,137
 Did you know they have
special relationship? 

27
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,313
 What?
I did not realize it? 

28
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,516
 - What is the special relationship?
- Eat your food. 

29
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,286
 Tell me everything you know. 

30
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,313
 - you can kill him.
- No, he was in rehab.

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,391

 China, and India. 

35
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,471
 Scary. 

36
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,312
 - I'll give you a dollar to eat.
- One dollar? 

37
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,437
 I do not know what she sees in him.
you're so much smarter than him. 

38
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,511
 - Kevin clever.
- You're just smart. 

39
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,971
 blow he gave the car? 

40
00:04:56,995 --> 00:05:00,273
 - It is to be smart?
- Do not forget that, Dad? Why? 

41
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:02,804
 Why not? 

42
00:05:02,822 --> 00:05:04,922
 Daniel ... never mind. 

43
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,119
 I just do not do not want him to hang out with
boys are older, that's all. 

44
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,351
 I'm old enough. 

45
00:05:19,602 --> 00:05:21,672
 my father's hair. 

46
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,351
 His father did not have hair. 

47
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,471
 That's what I expected. 

48
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,351
 - Daniel!
- Sorry. </ Font>

49
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,871
 Daniel, we, have
to prepare for this sale. 

50
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,391
 We need it.

 Why Humans Sand
People steal eyes? 

57
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:18,406
 To feed
their children in months. 

58
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,337
 Why do not feed
with something else? 

59
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,392
 eye is the most delicious. 

60

locked at night, huh? 

64
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:04,726
 - Not touched.
- Bi-bi, I'm not. 

65
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,054
 What kind of animals that eat
lettuce and meat? 

66
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:12,485
 Rabbit. A very large rabbit.
With adjustable thumb. 

67
00:08:12,507 --> 00:08:16,339
Or maybe  mutant lizards, not
Sammy? Stuck in the obscurity. 

68
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,140
 Do not listen to your sister.
Juice? 

69
00:08:18,155 --> 00:08:20,146
 Oh, I must go. 

70
00:08:21,753 --> 00:08:23,744

75
00:08:47,037 --> 00:08:48,318
 Yes, sir.

Mom says  must say good night. 

87

 - Good evening, mother!
- Good evening, Jesse. You ... 

88
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:34,619
now!

 Sammy, you startled me. 

91
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,516
 I had a bad dream. 

92
00:11:54,118 --> 00:11:57,642
 right.
It's okay now. 

93
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,349
 Sammy, do you know who did? 

94
00:12:16,024 --> 00:12:18,015
 Sand Man. 

95
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:20,487
 Sand Man?
Whether it's your toy? 

96
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,476
 He was in my dream. 

97
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,354
 And he told me to do this ...
in your dreams? 

98
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:32,519
 He did himself before
entered my room. 

99
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,177
 There was no sign of forced entry. 

100
00:12:38,193 --> 00:12:41,051
 Ensure that all doors
and windows locked? 

101
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,061
 Yes, negotiating all night. 

102
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:46,077
 And the food.
Not missing anything? </ Font>

103
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:50,764
 - No, no.
- Well, I see, 

104
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,359
 We have two scenarios.
People who do this ... 

105
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,330
 has the key.
Or ... is ... 

106
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,318
 someone in the house ... 

107
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:09,479
 I think not.
We all slept. </ Font>

108
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,275
 Not a problem, sir, but the people
doing strange things in their sleep 

109
00:13:14,298 --> 00:13:19,253
 We met a family who awoke with
messy kitchen every morning 

110
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:22,469
Apparently his daughter 
teens eat sleep. 

111
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,594
 - He eats sleeping?
- Yes! </ Font>

112
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,579
 Yes, like a sleepwalker,
it enhances ... 

113
00:13:27,616 --> 00:13:30,337
 And walk in your dreams,
they even ... 

114
00:13:30,362 --> 00:13:34,394
 Go to the kitchen and eat.
This is the craziest thing. </ Font>

115
00:13:35,126 --> 00:13:39,032
 pack Officer, who here does not
a mess due to cooking, this is the kind of ... 

116
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:41,010
 bad joke
such as geologists. 

117
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:43,377
 I do not know if I should
angry or impressed. 

118
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,395
 Well .. 

119
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:48,535
 children may be watching.
I see you have an alarm. </ Font>

120
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:51,587
 Yes, but the system
Security disconnected. </ Font>

121
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:53,934
 - Trying to save.
- Yes 

122
00:13:53,976 --> 00:13:56,952
 I suggest you re-connect.
It is a good investment. </ Font>

123
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,960
 Be careful. 

124
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,431
 Three bedrooms, two bathrooms ... 

125
00:14:07,756 --> 00:14:12,081
 Need repairs, but this
opportunity to change in your favor. 

126
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,167
 Expect to see the kitchen. 

127
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,182
 I'm interested. It is
great opportunity to buy. 

128
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,399
 I had to lift it. Keep
with kitchen. 

129
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:33,001
 right.
Alright. </ Font>

130
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:34,790
 I need to get something? 

131
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,267
 No, I have. 

132
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,312
 Here is ... 

133
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:39,860
 Okay.
Take a deep breath! </ Font>

134
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:45,873
 Best? Yes?
Alright. </ Font>

135
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,510
 Hospital easier. 

136
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:55,271

138
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:00,976
 How experienced this? 

139
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:03,203
 I worry a lot. 

140
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,514
 Take every day. It increasingly
old, and has decreased and decreased. 

141
00:15:11,554 --> 00:15:14,303
 Now, the maximum
You have a cold. </ Font>

142
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,516
 What do you think of this place? 

143
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,398
 This is an opportunity to buy? 

144
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,587
 I knew I had to sell it to you,
but probably the best. 

145
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,800
 I think we should keep
time without wires. 

146
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:14,269
 I think we have to wait a week,
it can get the job done. 

147
00:16:15,512 --> 00:16:16,533
 me ... 

148
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:19,307
 I do not ... 

149
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:21,929
 I do not think I would
reached, Lacy. 

150
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,791
 But wait a minute,
You said it was great. </ Font>

151
00:16:24,845 --> 00:16:28,786
 No, I'm right, I,
but this is a lot of competition. 

152
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,350
 sorry. 

153
00:16:32,313 --> 00:16:33,967
 you lie? 

154
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:37,866
 - Come on, Lacy.
- You're lying, right? </ Font>

155
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:42,952
 Why would you do that, Daniel? 

156
00:16:44,824 --> 00:16:49,504
 Look, I just do not ... do not want to ...
giving bad news. 

157
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:51,161
 - Okay!
- At least once. </ Font>

- I do not lie ...

- No. 

167
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,311
 Why is that, Sammy? 

168
00:17:32,032 --> 00:17:34,121
 - Why is that? 

169

 Parents Tauton
discuss every night 

170
00:17:37,327 --> 00:17:40,587
 Then his father moved to
apartment near the airport, 

171
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,500
 Now they only meet on weekends. 

172
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,308
 Do not worry Sammy. Daddy will not be
everywhere. Now try to sleep. </ Font>

 Thank you, Mr. Barrett.

178
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:50,424

alarm goes off. Disabling now. </ Font>

179
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,436
 Nothing indicates that sensor. 

180
00:18:57,131 --> 00:18:59,521
 - Are you there?
- Yes, Mr Barrett. </ Font>

181
00:18:59,553 --> 00:19:03,112
 We believe it is a false alarm
due to interference. 

182
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:05,850
 What kind of disorder?
Which sensor has been activated? </ Font>

183
00:19:05,905 --> 00:19:08,353
 - All of them!
- What? </ Font>

184
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,275
 system reports that all eight
sensors simultaneously fired. 

185
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:16,205
 I do not understand ...
How might 

186
00:19:16,232 --> 00:19:21,006
 We know so little. Send someone
at 9 am to check the system. 

187
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,568
 - Sorry for the inconvenience.
- Okay, thank you. </ Font>

188
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:35,408
 They said it was a false alarm.
A system disorders. </ Font>

189
00:19:48,386 --> 00:19:51,745
 Daniel,
what happened? 

190
00:19:56,322 --> 00:19:58,717
 have Talking with children about this? 

191
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,470
 Both said they slept. 

192
00:20:01,656 --> 00:20:03,894
 And it is certain that
telling the truth? 

193
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:08,728
 I also have kids, you know. Sometimes
do anything for your attention, lies, 

194
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,745
 Happens all the time.
Does not reflect you as a parent. </ Font>

195
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,615
 I understand it could happen. But
it does not in this case. 

196
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,792
 My wife did not feel
safe at home today. 

197
00:20:22,032 --> 00:20:24,705
 Look, I know you can
seem harsh, but ... 

198
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:28,502
 Any reason for upset
between you and your wife? 

199
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:32,720
 Disputes in the family. Children
always react to these things. 

200
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:35,522
 Excuse me, Mr. Barrett,
done here! 

201
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:38,278
 I have not found anything
wrong with the system. 

202
00:20:38,306 --> 00:20:41,559
 - So what triggered?
- This could be due to many things. </ Font>

203
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:45,485
 It is technical. But actually,
no one tried to enter. 

204
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,954
 Are any of you have something
and want to tell us? 

205
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,304
 Like what? 

206
00:21:00,836 --> 00:21:04,340
 see there are things that are a little strange here before. 

207
00:21:04,374 --> 00:21:08,493
 and .. when this happens,
can create ... 

208
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,461
 feelings between us, and ... 

209
00:21:11,484 --> 00:21:13,488
 About the photo, yes? 

210
00:21:13,912 --> 00:21:17,951
 Yes, it is.
there you take it? 

211
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,476
 I sleep,
how can? 

212
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,351
 Sammy? 

213
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,274
 Sam,
dreamed it again? 

214
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,431
 On Sand Man? 

215
00:21:37,744 --> 00:21:39,416
 What dream? 

216
00:21:44,944 --> 00:21:47,014
 "Sand Man" took the photo? 

217
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,511
 right,
can you tell me? 

218
00:21:50,071 --> 00:21:51,565
 I could not. 

219
00:21:52,189 --> 00:21:53,818
 What's up, Lacy? 

220
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,391
 why not? 

221
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,162
 He told me not to tell. 

222
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:06,055
 Daniel, stop, no matter
more photos now. 

223
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,558
 Daniel, we will
talk about it? 

224
00:22:09,142 --> 00:22:10,509
 Want to talk now? 

225
00:22:11,656 --> 00:22:13,923
 why I was not notified
about his dreams? 

226
00:22:13,947 --> 00:22:17,192
 I do not think it's a big deal.
Boys having nightmares. </ Font>

227
00:22:17,223 --> 00:22:20,236
 - But do not act like it.
- Obviously I was wrong. </ Font>

228
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:23,811
 Not funny, Sammy.

229
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,278
 But I do not know where they are.
I did not take them. </ Font>

230
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,273
 Sammy, this is not real.
You understand, right? </ Font>

231
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,510
 Daniel, stop!
What do we do about it? </ Font>

232
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,311
 I do not know,
no one knows. 

233
00:22:41,968 --> 00:22:44,960
 want to go to therapy?
How are we going to pay for this? </ Font>

234
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,569
 He is our son,
and not our cable. 

235
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:50,055
 I know, Lacy. 

236
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,180
 Karen says she knows someone
when Shelly went through some things, 

237
00:22:58,206 --> 00:23:00,758
 He worked with
credit payment ... 

238
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,884
 You tell them that we
in financial trouble? 

239
00:23:06,226 --> 00:23:08,217
 Daniel, stop! 

240
00:23:11,001 --> 00:23:14,038
 Okay, let's wait
few days, huh? 

241
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,255

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,353
 Karen said they were looking for ...
what? A therapist for Sammy? </ Font>

247
00:23:50,587 --> 00:23:51,488
 No. .. 

248
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,137
 No, no, it's not.
It's just the wrong time ...

- You! </ Font>

251
00:24:00,877 --> 00:24:03,478
 He peed in his pants. 

252
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,311
 Sammy! 

253
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,311
 Sammy! 

254
00:24:15,014 --> 00:24:17,574
 Hey, if I wanted to go to the bathroom
You can tell me. 

255
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,431
 Sammy, what's the problem? 

256
00:24:22,991 --> 00:24:24,782
 Sammy, what's the problem? 

257
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,085
 No. ..
Alright. </ Font>

258
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,359
 Sammy, stop!
Sammy! Sammy! </ Font>

259
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,430

he's okay? 

260
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,392
 Go home.
I am here. </ Font>

261
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,390
 Oh, shit ... 

262
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:07,309
 They just hit home. Hundreds
them. Karen, I can not even explain. </ Font>

263

264
00:26:12,932 --> 00:26:15,827
 - Can be contaminated.
- Just to see. </ Font>

265
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:18,085
 Okay, you two,
Do not touch them! 

266
00:26:20,043 --> 00:26:21,535
 yes! 

267
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:24,247
 Dude, this is incredible! 

268
00:26:24,281 --> 00:26:27,239
 This is clearly a
early infectious outbreak. 

269
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:29,144
 Dude, should be put
quarantined. 

270
00:26:29,162 --> 00:26:31,417
 Silence!
do as they pleased you. 

271
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,018
 Let's do an autopsy on some
samples, to see if they are sick. 

272
00:26:37,034 --> 00:26:40,986
 We do not have flu reports
influenza in the local population, 

273
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:43,027
 But this could be a new thing 

274
00:26:43,058 --> 00:26:44,885
 And if not ill? 

275
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:49,817
 We will look for environmental causes,
hail, lightning. 

276
00:26:49,903 --> 00:26:54,270
 Fireworks are not discarded
They are easily confused. </ Font>

277
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,712
 Look, we would be grateful
we will find the cause 

278
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:05,470
 We have used ... 

279
00:27:05,502 --> 00:27:08,043
 Strange things
happening here 

280
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,359
 And it would be nice if they stopped. 

281
00:27:11,552 --> 00:27:14,274
 We will do our best,
Mr. Barrett. </ Font>

282
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,478

283
00:27:26,387 --> 00:27:29,379
 Sam, Dad said that
you yell at the park today 

284
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:35,336
 not remember
shouting in the park? 

285
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:43,699
 What do you remember? 

286
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,468
 I remember playing in the grass
with other children. 

287
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:55,732
 - Yes ..
- And then there was nothing more that I remember ... 

288
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:07,218
 Hey ... Sam, why not brush
teeth. then go to sleep? 

289
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,836
 I'll catch up. 

290
00:28:11,913 --> 00:28:13,159
 Thank you, friend. 

291
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:31,780
 therapy I'll call tomorrow morning.
I will find a way to pay. </ Font>

292
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,316
 - What happened?
- There is something ... 

293
00:29:26,328 --> 00:29:28,702
 I turn on the lights
and saw someone in the room ... 

294
00:29:28,723 --> 00:29:30,714
 - What do you see?
- I do not know, man ... 

295
00:29:30,734 --> 00:29:32,725
 - Someone
- Oh my God! Sam! </ Font>

296
00:29:35,212 --> 00:29:36,827
 - What is it?
- Sam! </ Font>

297
00:29:36,851 --> 00:29:39,088
 - What happened?
- Sam! </ Font>

298
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,351
 - Sammy!
- Sam! </ Font>

299
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,391
 Sam? 

300
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,011
 Sam! 

301
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,391
 What are you doing?
Sam? </ Font>

302
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:06,646
 Sam? 

303
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:09,172
 Mrs. ..? 

304
00:30:09,305 --> 00:30:10,916
 okay. 

305
00:30:10,946 --> 00:30:12,937
 Sam up. 

306
00:30:16,937 --> 00:30:18,846
 Why are we here? 

307
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,913
 I do not know how he came out
without triggering an alarm. 

308
00:30:35,178 --> 00:30:37,678
 should check the system
again in the morning. 

309
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,923
 Daniel ... 

310
00:30:40,486 --> 00:30:43,098
 I saw someone in Sam's room. 

311
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,823
 windows were locked. If you
was in the door, and saw someone there ... 

312
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,351
 where'd it go? 

313
00:30:52,155 --> 00:30:54,128
 I do not know,
I can not explain ... 

314
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:56,500
 But I see someone
standing on the bed of Sam. 

315
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,478
 When turned on the light,
both disappear 

316
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,666
 you see Sam in the room, how he was outside 

317
00:31:04,085 --> 00:31:06,121
 You think I berhasulinasi? 

318
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,479
 Lacy, what is it?
What are we talking about? </ Font>

319
00:31:14,036 --> 00:31:18,434
 I do not know ... I just
say that something is happening. 

320
00:31:18,772 --> 00:31:21,233
 I am now, not Sam. 

321
00:31:21,402 --> 00:31:24,314
 Look, honey, I know. 

322
00:31:25,268 --> 00:31:28,677
 We will continue to deal with it now or we will be crazy 

323
00:31:30,148 --> 00:31:32,218
 It will not help anything. 

324
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,431
 Fireballs! 

325
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,648
 Can not say
to mothers about us here. 

326
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,272
 What? I think
put you in trouble? 

327
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,399
 - Promises?
- What are you gonna do to me? </ Font>

328
00:33:13,454 --> 00:33:17,447
 you're a bad girl ... 

329
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,015
 What are you doing?
Stop! </ Font>

330
00:33:23,032 --> 00:33:24,694
 Hey, man,
What's wrong with you? 

331
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:25,860
 Sorry .. 

332
00:33:26,532 --> 00:33:28,568
 Ever kissed a girl before? 

333
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,311
 here. 

334
00:33:47,645 --> 00:33:49,636
 Close your lips. 

335
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,351
 Close your eyes. 

336
00:34:55,622 --> 00:34:58,375
 If anyone in this house 

337
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,436
 We'll see him with this. 

338
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:06,649
 There is a strange way
spice up our sex life, huh? 

339
00:35:07,924 --> 00:35:11,917
 Not a good idea,
but I liked what you think. 

340
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,358
 This will solve the problem, Lacy. 

341
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:27,113
 - Do you think they're watching us?
- You mean father?? </ Font>

342
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,320
 Yes. 

343
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:32,903
 Maybe 

344
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,391
 he thought someone here? 

345
00:35:37,192 --> 00:35:38,419
 No. 

346
00:35:39,092 --> 00:35:41,392
 So why Dad
put the camera? 

347
00:35:42,636 --> 00:35:45,940
 - For sure.
- Command Control? </ Font>

348
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,472
 - Yes, Moonbase?
- I'm afraid. </ Font>

349
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,433
 Do not worry, Sammy.
will not happen anything happen to you. 

350
00:35:56,976 --> 00:35:58,747
 I promise 

351
00:38:50,307 --> 00:38:52,343
 Three bedrooms, two bathrooms ... 

352
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,127
 Need repairs, but this
opportunity to change. 

353
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,141
 your liking. 

354
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,391
 What do you think, darling? 

355
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,391
 seems it took a lot of work 

356
00:39:11,544 --> 00:39:14,359
 It is, I know
This area is very good, 

357
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:17,398
 And you will not find much
good for a place like this. 

358
00:39:22,825 --> 00:39:25,658
 how flexible
is selling? 

359
00:39:26,053 --> 00:39:29,125
 Highly motivated.
Say, can greatly ... 

360
00:39:34,925 --> 00:39:36,734
 Are you okay? 

361
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,431
 Lacy? 

362
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,271
 Lacy! 

363
00:40:44,953 --> 00:40:46,296
 Hello? 

364
00:40:46,312 --> 00:40:48,981
 Lacy, the banana. what happened to you? 

365
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,378
 Very rarely do customers
rich complain ... 

366
00:40:52,397 --> 00:40:55,511
 They said they saw the horrors
your presentation this morning, 

367
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:58,005
 what I should call an ambulance, 

368
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,471
 Oh God. 

369
00:41:01,484 --> 00:41:04,955
 I know you do a lot of pressure these days.
You have to take time off for a while. 

370
00:41:04,984 --> 00:41:07,020
 No, Pete.
I could not do it. 

371
00:41:07,394 --> 00:41:12,528
 no, this is not an option, Lacy.
Customer changed his mind. </ Font>

372
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,472
 Sorry.
telephone me if you feel better. 

373
00:41:24,077 --> 00:41:26,820
 Pete, please
let me explain. 

374
00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:29,906
 Mrs. Janice Barrett? I'm Janice

00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:33,197
 I can not phoned your husband,
so I decided to phoned you. 

376
00:41:33,219 --> 00:41:35,219
 Sorry, yes.
Please. </ Font>

377
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,251
 I have new information
about the incident, 

378
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,076
 But I'm afraid of having more queries
than answers. 

379
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,695
 What ... type of question? 

380
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:46,080
 negative for bird flu 

381
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,159
 But how
way to impact 

382
00:41:50,185 --> 00:41:54,788
 shows that birds are descended from three
region, not one, as expected. 

383
00:41:54,815 --> 00:41:57,989
 I do not understand,
what does it mean? 

384
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:01,005
 Means 3
Different migration ... 

385
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,907
 3 different directions
fly to your house. 

386
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:08,047
 It is as if they invade your home.

 Yes, some personal projects. But

 I have a job. 

414
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,311
 Are you serious? Daniel ... 

415
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,451
 Let's start from the 15. 

416
00:44:05,918 --> 00:44:08,876
 Daniel, this is amazing! 

417
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,468
 Ask Karen and Mike could
bring Sam tonight. 

418
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,736
 Jesse could live with Ratner.
Let's celebrate for a change. </ Font>

 no ...
Only happy. </ Font>

421
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,511
 Daniel? 

422
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,391
 Daniel? 

423
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:50,511
 Daniel?! 

424
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,311
 Why did not you answer? 

425
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,511
 Daniel, wake up! 

426
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,511
 Daniel, wake up, wake up! 

427
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,311
 What am I doing in the kitchen?? 

428
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,135
 I found you in the park. 

429
00:46:39,149 --> 00:46:42,186
 you do not remember
out of the room? 

430
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,430
 No. 

431
00:46:49,472 --> 00:46:51,842
 It's very ... weird. 

432
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,788
 It is more than strange. 

433
00:46:55,227 --> 00:46:58,075
 I'm ready to give the news of me. 

434
00:47:01,976 --> 00:47:04,968
 I lost consciousness
six hours today. 

435
00:47:05,858 --> 00:47:09,663
 And the last thing I remember
was I was in this room ... 

436
00:47:11,675 --> 00:47:16,510
<font Customer color="#ffff33"> told Pete
I have some sort of oddity. </ Font>

437
00:47:16,535 --> 00:47:21,325
 And I woke up in bed ...
and with it. 

438
00:47:23,154 --> 00:47:25,145
 Jesus, Lacy! 

439
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,472
 Daniel,
I have to show you something. </ Font>

440
00:47:33,306 --> 00:47:35,485
 So I started researching .... 

441
00:47:35,508 --> 00:47:36,543
 and ... 

442
00:47:36,561 --> 00:47:42,663
 A more logical to say something that annoys
in the earth's geomagnetic field, 

443
00:47:42,689 --> 00:47:46,992
 And this ... make
birds of course .. 

444
00:47:47,016 --> 00:47:50,033
 Some people say that
working with the government, 

445
00:47:50,053 --> 00:47:53,353
 who is testing some
secret military technology ... 

446
00:47:53,372 --> 00:47:55,069
 And others ... 

447
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:57,450
 They think that it is something more. 

448
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,473
 Something ...
are not from here. 

449
00:48:05,312 --> 00:48:07,966
 What do you mean?
What is not on here? </ Font>

450
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,279
 not from ... this planet. 

451
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,877
 Lacy ... 

452
00:48:17,015 --> 00:48:19,006
 I know it's hard to believe
just believe ... 

453
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:22,583
 I want to believe,
I mean ... 

454
00:48:22,683 --> 00:48:25,384
 Alien?
It is ... 

455
00:48:27,106 --> 00:48:28,333
 It was crazy. 

456
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,477
 Right? You know why not
make a self-diagnosis via the internet. 

457
00:48:32,515 --> 00:48:34,069
 Stop, listen to this. 

458
00:48:34,099 --> 00:48:38,496
 someone reported
we experienced the same thing. 

459
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,816
 society where death
big bird occurs. 

460
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,349
 This image is of a child 5 years
of the Chesapeake Bay in 2007. 

461
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:49,280
 Shortly before disappearing. 

462
00:48:49,312 --> 00:48:51,020
 Lost, Daniel. 

463
00:48:51,047 --> 00:48:53,351
His family claims that color="#ffff33"> <font

464
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:56,550
 And they entered in
his room for weeks. 

465
00:49:00,777 --> 00:49:02,768
 Sam made this yesterday. 

466
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,318
 Maybe Sammy saw this
online drawing ... and copied. 

467
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,840
 And maybe make 800
we predict bird house? 

468
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,177
 I found a guy in town, 

469
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,605
 that says an expert on this subject.
Let's talk to him. </ Font>

00:49:29,628 --> 00:49:30,736
 - Not!
- Yes! </ Font>

471
00:49:30,744 --> 00:49:31,637
 No, no, no ... 

472
00:49:31,654 --> 00:49:33,611
 What other explanation do you have? 

473
00:49:33,885 --> 00:49:37,330
 Just because I can not explain something does not
means that states are responsible Aliens! 

474
00:49:37,344 --> 00:49:39,361
 Do not see anything
certainly does not happen? 

475
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:41,332
 Maybe these people
believe something crazy! 

476
00:49:41,336 --> 00:49:43,325
 Maybe these people
not so crazy! 

477
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:45,340
 Who are you?
Where is my wife? </ Font>

478
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,961
 Stop it!
Stranger things have happened 

479
00:49:47,977 --> 00:49:49,005
 To, to! 

480
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:50,759
 Stranger things have happened ... 

481
00:49:50,767 --> 00:49:53,472
 But this ...
It's too much. </ Font>

482
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:58,325
 There must be another answer. 

483
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,133
 Hey, uninstall your clothes. 

484
00:50:18,168 --> 00:50:20,471
 must not swim with clothes. 

485
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,694
 Come on, you bastard,
I want to swim 

486
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:31,352
 Sammy, come here, let
I see you. </ Font>

487
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,391
 Sammy, come here! 

488
00:50:36,683 --> 00:50:39,641
 Okay, I'll just see. okay? 

489
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:42,201
 lift. 

490
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,391
 Sammy, tell me who
do this to you? 

491
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,712
 Sammy, I want you to tell me
Who did this to you. </ Font>

492
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:22,505
 - You know that girl, Jennifer?
- Yes 

493
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:24,473
 I have pictures of her when marturbasi. 

494
00:51:24,689 --> 00:51:26,217
 - Really?
- Yes 

495
00:51:26,701 --> 00:51:28,840
 Think deceive me?
I saw you with Shelly. </ Font>

496
00:51:30,034 --> 00:51:32,992
 - He kissed?
- Yes. </ Font>

497
00:51:33,144 --> 00:51:36,896
 - you touch my breasts?
- On the one hand, yes. </ Font>

498
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,099
 Damn, big dog,
This is nothing. 

499
00:51:40,475 --> 00:51:44,244
 Get off pro "center-city."
That's what I did with my girls. </ Font>

500
00:51:50,603 --> 00:51:52,203
 Hey, Barret! 

501
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,435
 Dude, stop! 

502
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,476
 - You better run, bitch!
- Do not be stupid. stop! 

503
00:52:01,057 --> 00:52:03,368
 I'll shoot your ass! 

504
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,471
 paralyzed! 

505
00:52:48,855 --> 00:52:51,608
 Come on,
it was not so painfully effeminate. 

506
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,511
 Jesse? 

507
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,511
 Jesse! 

508
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,429
 How are you? 

509
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,291
 I found nothing
cause of the incident. 

510
00:53:09,304 --> 00:53:10,808
 The MRI is clear, 

511
00:53:10,831 --> 00:53:14,881
 So, as I said, I do not think
dealing with neurological problems. 

512
00:53:14,905 --> 00:53:16,479
 So what do you think it is? 

513
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:20,852
 I believe this is a symptom
emotional trauma. 

514
00:53:20,884 --> 00:53:24,241
 Now, I want you to listen
caution, Mr and Mrs Barrett. 

515
00:53:25,374 --> 00:53:29,192
 During the inspection I found
unusual body marks on children generally. 

516
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:33,081
 Excuse me,
sign what? 

517
00:53:33,852 --> 00:53:37,072
Looks  small
geometric shapes. 

518
00:53:37,484 --> 00:53:39,475
 boxes, rectangles,
circle ... 

519
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:42,300
 problematic part is that ... 

520
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,312
This seems like 
printed with a branding iron. 

521
00:53:47,437 --> 00:53:51,622
 Now, Mr and Mrs Barrett,
This my opinion, he did not do it alone. 

522
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:55,615
 Jesse said he did not know
could be like that. 

523
00:53:57,019 --> 00:53:59,722
 you do not know
how he got it? 

524
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,052
 no ... 

525
00:54:05,965 --> 00:54:08,490
 Well, I must tell you
that because of their age, 

526
00:54:08,504 --> 00:54:12,392
 need in-depth investigation
to Child Protective Services. 

527
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:15,010
 This is standard procedure. 

528
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:17,796
 must answer
some questions. 

529
00:54:20,067 --> 00:54:22,058
 Understand what I'm saying? 

530
00:54:23,846 --> 00:54:25,837
 yes. 

531
00:54:27,917 --> 00:54:31,454
 Mr Barrett, report says
Jesse playing in the woods ... 

532
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,778
 With her in at night. 

533
00:54:33,815 --> 00:54:36,773
 Yes, boys
Ratner called Kevin. </ Font>

534
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:39,897
 few years
older than Jesse. 

535
00:54:41,082 --> 00:54:45,951
 is there any reason to believe that
she got into something strange? 

536
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:52,302
 - Dad, what are you doing?
- Daniel, stop! </ Font>

537
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,241
 - Daniel, stop!
- Hey, Mr. Barrett ... 

538
00:54:54,266 --> 00:54:56,126
 - Jesse, how are you?
- What did you do to my son? </ Font>

539
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:59,371
 - What are you doing, huh?
- No! </ Font>

540
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,392
 - Daniel, stop!
- He's only 14! </ Font>

541
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,345
 Stop it! 

542
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,430
Ask your child 
what he did! 

543
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,316
What's wrong 
with you? 

544
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:25,901
 Jesse! 

545
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:27,914
 Do not bother me. 

546
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,471
 Hey. 

547
00:56:04,004 --> 00:56:05,995
 Do not touch me! 

548
00:56:07,269 --> 00:56:10,102
 contact Service Tomorrow
Child Protection. </ Font>

549
00:56:10,128 --> 00:56:12,820
 my friend asked me like a criminal. 

550
00:56:12,838 --> 00:56:13,730
 Lacy ... 

551
00:56:13,742 --> 00:56:16,328
 Karen said that Sammy says
sand man to do it ... 

552
00:56:16,352 --> 00:56:19,194
 you realize that he thinks
Sand is human, right? </ Font>

553
00:56:19,233 --> 00:56:20,965
 - Calm.
- Hear that? </ Font>

554
00:56:20,994 --> 00:56:22,432
 You hear that shit? 

555
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,786
 - Jesus Christ!
- Something hurt our children! </ Font>

556
00:56:25,831 --> 00:56:28,716
 - Believe it or not?
- I do not need to hear that shit! </ Font>

557
00:56:28,735 --> 00:56:31,454
 So tell me who told you!
Or do we imagine that! </ Font>

558
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,471
 I do not know! 

559
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:36,318
 But when they know,
I will put an end to it. </ Font>

560
00:56:36,384 --> 00:56:39,296
 Yes, just as you do today, huh?
Daniel, the hero! </ Font>

561
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,357
 What happens in the pool? 

562
00:56:54,401 --> 00:56:56,312
 What happened in the woods? 

563
00:56:56,353 --> 00:56:59,398
 Ratner told that
your father being a psychopath. 

564
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,476
 up, Sammy! 

565
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,356
 Sammy, wake up! 

566
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,351
 What is it, Daddy? 

567
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,471
 What happened? 

568
00:59:30,205 --> 00:59:33,242
 Remember when Jesse was born she has been sick? 

569
00:59:35,725 --> 00:59:37,271
 Doctors do not know what is ... 

570
00:59:37,284 --> 00:59:40,226
 he just say that we all
have to wait until the morning ... 

571
00:59:40,237 --> 00:59:42,074
 To see if he would be okay? 

572
00:59:44,022 --> 00:59:46,092
Tonight is 
the longest of my life. 

573
00:59:49,197 --> 00:59:51,106
 I feel ... 

574
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:53,205
 helpless. 

575
00:59:57,144 --> 01:00:00,770
 I do not know who's kissing
young children at 01:00 am. 

576
01:00:03,811 --> 01:00:06,682
 thinking about it all night, but
I finally realized something 

577
01:00:06,702 --> 01:00:09,314
 I'm afraid. 

578
01:00:11,432 --> 01:00:15,391
 Whatever it is, since then,
I have to face ... 

579
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,432
 I know I can cope
because I have you. 

580
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,470
 I'm ready to believe. 

581
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,511
 Mr. Pollard? 

582
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,351
 Yes. 

583
01:01:00,371 --> 01:01:02,282
 Sorry ... 

584
01:01:02,306 --> 01:01:05,378
 - I had to go to the store.
- Okay. </ Font>

585
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,312
 Lacy and I was
is my husband, Daniel. 

586
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:14,358
 You said on the phone
had two children. 

587
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,953
 Yes, I am ... 

588
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:21,800
 We thought it would be better ...
if we notify you first. 

589
01:01:36,853 --> 01:01:38,026
 Thank you. 

590
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:42,274
 Sitting in the living room,
I'm going to make us tea. </ Font>

591
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,151
 I think he has a cat. 

592
01:02:19,175 --> 01:02:21,431
 Cats do not care about them. 

593
01:02:21,854 --> 01:02:24,313
 Before I lived in the suburbs,
but ... 

594
01:02:25,549 --> 01:02:28,586
 The dogs were barking day and night
when they pass. 

595
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,036
 Dogs can feel them. 

596
01:02:35,101 --> 01:02:37,137
 They kept me awake
all night, so ... 

597
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,604
 I moved into this building here.
without dogs. 

598
01:02:43,542 --> 01:02:46,500
 So I sleep
slightly better at night. 

599
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,510
 Do not fight them. 

600
01:02:55,205 --> 01:02:57,196
 They? 

601
01:02:58,384 --> 01:03:00,007
 The Grays ... 

602
01:03:00,031 --> 01:03:01,493
 it's called. 

603
01:03:06,022 --> 01:03:10,488
 There are three types of aliens known. 

604
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:15,389
 Grey, and Reptilians Insectoids. 

605
01:03:15,828 --> 01:03:19,787
 But in 9 cases out of 10 people
reported seeing the Grays. 

606
01:03:20,725 --> 01:03:24,745
 In fact, I doubt
on the other two. 

607
01:03:24,835 --> 01:03:26,826
 Especially Reptiles. 

608
01:03:27,141 --> 01:03:29,830
 I do not think they make sense. 

609
01:03:29,851 --> 01:03:33,844
 Yes, I
starting to get skeptical (doubt). 

610
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,431
 sorry. 

611
01:03:41,456 --> 01:03:43,447
 Let me prepare. 

612
01:03:43,458 --> 01:03:46,398
The first thing 
you need to do is ... 

613
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,358
Determine whether 
true or not ... 

614
01:03:49,978 --> 01:03:52,094
The color="#ffff33"> <font in contact. 

615
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,471
 This ... is the test? 

616
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:59,272
 It is a series of questions. 

617
01:03:59,867 --> 01:04:01,903
 To see if anyone was crazy. 

618
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,006
 well. 

619
01:04:05,096 --> 01:04:06,553
 Let's do it. 

620
01:04:10,275 --> 01:04:13,656
 you look at the environment
some focus light in the sky, 

621
01:04:13,672 --> 01:04:15,370
 Moving from one
unusual way? 

622
01:04:15,383 --> 01:04:16,885
 - Not!
- Not! </ Font>

623
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:22,513
Experiencing some 
headaches or migraines? 

624
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:24,917
 No. 

625
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,928
 Are any of you heard of the
ringing in your ears ... 

626
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:33,352
 That just sounds
in your head? 

627
01:04:36,165 --> 01:04:37,708
 Yes. 

628
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:45,393
 Prolonged Illness,
strange allergic ... 

629
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:46,899
 Or nosebleeds? 

630
01:04:46,923 --> 01:04:48,895
 - Yes
- Yes .. 

631
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,353
 Are you experiencing some behavior
abnormal animals on the environment? 

632
01:04:58,797 --> 01:05:02,321
 birds from three different regions
flew into our house. 

633
01:05:05,245 --> 01:05:07,699
 I can say that this
they qualify. 

634
01:05:07,719 --> 01:05:13,089
 Did any of you lose consciousness?
Period without a sense of time. </ Font>

635
01:05:16,914 --> 01:05:19,833
 And then having
feeling ... 

636
01:05:19,977 --> 01:05:22,855
 can not control
her own body? 

637
01:05:23,262 --> 01:05:25,253
 How do you know all this? 

638
01:05:28,009 --> 01:05:30,079
 You are not alone in this ... 

639
01:05:31,229 --> 01:05:34,141
 Others have experienced
what you are experiencing. 

640
01:05:34,686 --> 01:05:38,560
 And they fought like
You are struggling right now. </ Font>

641
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,076
 why Grays,
whoever they may be, 

642
01:05:42,246 --> 01:05:46,000
 Does that make us interested in?
What makes us so special? </ Font>

643
01:05:47,836 --> 01:05:49,827
No color="#ffff33"> <font. 

644
01:05:50,188 --> 01:05:52,853
 Nothing is so

645
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:55,106
 I'm sorry. 

646
01:05:55,143 --> 01:05:57,688
 Waiting for
different response. 

647
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,626
 But this is beyond comprehension. 

648
01:06:02,622 --> 01:06:04,733
 response has
laboratory mice ... 

649
01:06:04,746 --> 01:06:07,114
 Selected by a scientist
white coat ... 

650
01:06:07,133 --> 01:06:10,692
 That gives electric shock in
brain cancer to pump? 

651
01:06:11,274 --> 01:06:16,223
 I have interviewed thousands of people
who said they were visited by the Grays. 

652
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,396
 They come from all
ways of the world. 

653
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:23,318
 The only thing they have in common ... 

654
01:06:23,692 --> 01:06:27,605
 their lives into hell
on earth as they are. 

655
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:34,902
 People think aliens attack
our planet in a major disaster 

656
01:06:34,913 --> 01:06:39,002
 Destroying monuments,
stealing our natural resources. 

657
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,278
 But this is not so,
actually. 

658
01:06:43,514 --> 01:06:45,505
 Invasion ... 

659
01:06:46,338 --> 01:06:48,374
 It happens. 

660
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,273
 No one knows exactly when ... 

661
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,137
 But ... 

662
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,516
 Here 

663
01:06:59,024 --> 01:07:01,015
 They were here. 

664
01:07:02,795 --> 01:07:05,832
 presence of Grays
now a fact of life. 

665
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,391
 Since death and taxes. 

666
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,471
 you know what they want? 

667
01:07:15,196 --> 01:07:17,187
 seems to be ... 

668
01:07:17,346 --> 01:07:19,337
 Learning, I guess. 

669
01:07:19,851 --> 01:07:21,887
 Experimenting with us. 

670
01:07:22,158 --> 01:07:25,798
 One thing we know for sure
is to use our fears against us. 

671
01:07:26,433 --> 01:07:28,310
 can get .... 

672
01:07:28,337 --> 01:07:30,328
 Playing with kids ... 

673
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,117
 Disrupting the kitchen or ...

 Do things
disappeared from the house. 

675
01:07:36,113 --> 01:07:39,830
 And before you realize is
living in a complete nightmare. 

676
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:44,035
And maybe 
they have been deployed. 

677
01:07:44,213 --> 01:07:45,909
 Implemented? 

678
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,476
 Here ...
This is how you control. </ Font>

679
01:07:51,228 --> 01:07:53,521
 Makes you do things
do not remember. 

680
01:07:53,538 --> 01:07:55,967
 Seeing things that are not there. 

681
01:07:58,307 --> 01:08:00,013
 Should I see it? 

682
01:08:00,031 --> 01:08:01,495
 Is that ...? 

683
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,110

 It is irritating ...
sting. 

688
01:08:18,149 --> 01:08:20,721
 That's what they
want you to think. 

689
01:08:20,793 --> 01:08:22,523
 The Grays ...

01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,511
Hide color="#ffff33"> <font what they are doing. 

691

01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,318
Most people 
did not know they had. 

693
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,431
 We can not remove it? 

694
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,920
 No. 

695
01:08:37,944 --> 01:08:39,935
 Do not believe me.
I'm trying. </ Font>

696
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,431
 Oh my God! 

697
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,476
 Every time I try
pick it up, look ... 

698
01:08:52,087 --> 01:08:54,078
 That deeper. 

699
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:05,594
 We will go! Come on
together and go. 

700
01:09:06,251 --> 01:09:12,201
 this creature certainly traveling
million light years to get here, 

701
01:09:13,243 --> 01:09:15,644
 Do you think moving
to a neighboring town ... 

702
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:19,414
 Or rent a motel would
prevent them finding? 

703
01:09:20,259 --> 01:09:22,329
 events
You naturally, 

704
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:26,201
 disorder in your home,
outages ... 

705
01:09:26,644 --> 01:09:28,622
 signs in body, 

706
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,691
 They do not
start something, Daniel. 

707
01:09:34,196 --> 01:09:36,187
 They get things done. 

708
01:09:37,968 --> 01:09:39,959
 It's like a countdown 

709
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,392
 The Grays watched them
family for a long time ... 

710
01:09:43,417 --> 01:09:45,408
 Before you reveal. 

711
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:48,021
 But once they do, 

712
01:09:48,039 --> 01:09:50,189
 Meaning they are ready
to take someone. 

713
01:09:51,079 --> 01:09:53,070
 What are you talking about? 

714
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,511
 This is important. 

715
01:09:56,637 --> 01:10:00,471
 The family members Grays
signed the first contact? 

716
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,471
 my youngest son, Sam. 

717
01:10:04,078 --> 01:10:06,114
 So Sam is most in danger. 

718
01:10:07,173 --> 01:10:11,549
 The Grays are usually the first to adopt
family members who are interested. 

719
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:16,279
 So that's it? 

720
01:10:16,371 --> 01:10:18,025
 I have to wait
take our son? 

721
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:19,154
 No. 

722
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,511
 you fight it
with everything you have. 

723
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:26,275
 The only way out is to be
too difficult for them. 

724
01:10:26,307 --> 01:10:29,185
 Until only
choose someone else. 

725
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,471
 Wait, wait. 

726
01:10:32,047 --> 01:10:33,834
 This can be done? 

727
01:10:33,858 --> 01:10:36,492
 Working in some cases ... 

728
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,811
 Yes. 

729
01:10:37,844 --> 01:10:41,803
 Hearing the selected cases
finally back ... 

730
01:10:41,817 --> 01:10:44,192
 But you can not count on it .. 

731
01:10:44,212 --> 01:10:45,985
 All the Grays do ... 

732
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,912
 It is intended to divide us,
to isolate us from each other ... 

733
01:10:48,938 --> 01:10:50,754
 That they choose. 

734
01:10:50,774 --> 01:10:52,810
 your best defense against them, 

735
01:10:53,252 --> 01:10:55,288
 This is when your family is united. 

736
01:10:55,726 --> 01:10:58,817
 But be quick.
not much time left. 

737
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:02,811
 Protect your family, Mr. Barrett. 

738
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,782
 Let the police,
show them the video alien. 

739
01:11:08,793 --> 01:11:10,939
 And say what? That
Aliens visited our house? 

740
01:11:10,955 --> 01:11:12,627
 We have implemented something invisible? 

741
01:11:12,647 --> 01:11:15,188
 police will think it's crazy.
No, I think it's crazy. </ Font>

742
01:11:15,195 --> 01:11:16,611
 must believe!
This is the truth! </ Font>

743
01:11:16,634 --> 01:11:18,708
 Think what would happen!
They will not believe ... 

744
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:20,815
 And they will take Jesse and Sam. 

745
01:11:20,823 --> 01:11:23,750
 would say that we are not good parents.
Everyone already has this suspicion. </ Font>

746
01:11:23,766 --> 01:11:28,497
 We must do something. You heard what he
said. Always end the same way. </ Font>

747
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,318
 I have a Remington 17. 

748
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,391
 The Ruger 204. 

749
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:42,439
 And Winchester 234, it's for a great caliber. 

750
01:11:43,094 --> 01:11:46,966
 I need something with a strong ...
at short distances. 

751
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:51,124
 What kind of practice your hunting? 

752
01:11:52,231 --> 01:11:53,664
 Mom, what's that? 

753
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:55,871
 Why dogs?
I think dad allergies ... 

754
01:11:55,873 --> 01:11:58,471
 he will take medication.
And beneficial to the dog house. </ Font>

755
01:11:58,494 --> 01:12:00,454
 - It's for protection, right?
- Talk about it later. </ Font>

756
01:12:00,477 --> 01:12:03,038
 - I want to talk about it now.
- What were you thinking with that one? </ Font>

757
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,391
 Yes. 

758
01:12:14,876 --> 01:12:15,865
 Hey, man. 

759
01:12:15,884 --> 01:12:17,243
 close the window? 

760
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:19,174
 To counteract the Sand Man. 

761
01:12:19,184 --> 01:12:21,801
 - Where's the dog?
- In the room with her mother. </ Font>

762
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:23,821
 We have a dog? 

763
01:12:24,877 --> 01:12:26,754
 - View hand man?
- Not! </ Font>

764
01:12:26,772 --> 01:12:28,763
 This is ridiculous. 

765
01:12:29,436 --> 01:12:31,427
 Jesse, come on. 

766
01:12:33,058 --> 01:12:34,506
 Jesse, stop! 

767
01:12:34,971 --> 01:12:36,882
 - Let's talk.
- Talk about what? </ Font>

768
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,639
 How to blow
my best friend? 

769
01:12:38,656 --> 01:12:41,560
 How everyone thinks
strange? you ruined everything. 

770
01:12:41,581 --> 01:12:44,508
 - Come on, I'll explain.
- No one explained! </ Font>

771
01:12:44,523 --> 01:12:47,004
Can not hold me 
treated as children. 

772
01:12:47,024 --> 01:12:49,289
 You can lie to Sam,
but you can not lie to me. 

773
01:12:49,307 --> 01:12:50,953
 Jesse! 

774
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,318
 I heard that closing
all window ... 

775
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,391
 What did he want to go? 

776
01:13:21,032 --> 01:13:23,023
 I think I know, but ... 

777
01:13:23,827 --> 01:13:27,499
 But if you talk, maybe
I would think he's crazy like. </ Font>

778
01:13:32,095 --> 01:13:35,132
 Look, I know your father
since I joined the school, 

779
01:13:35,969 --> 01:13:38,961
 And he always
really weird, but ... 

780
01:13:39,859 --> 01:13:41,850
 Do not think he's crazy. 

781
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:58,411
 If the sand man came,
talk to you tonight ... 

782
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:01,352
 I want you to promise me
will not listen, 

783
01:14:02,116 --> 01:14:04,115
 Or whatever he said. 

784
01:14:04,136 --> 01:14:05,272
 True? 

785
01:14:06,267 --> 01:14:09,304
 I promise. 

786
01:14:10,199 --> 01:14:14,980
 I may have to give
my eyes, but that's okay. 

787
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,632
 No you can not. the sand man
never satisfied ... 

788
01:14:18,647 --> 01:14:20,841
 So do not give anything. 

789
01:14:20,861 --> 01:14:22,852
 This is the only way to get rid of it. 

790
01:14:38,143 --> 01:14:40,134
 will come, right? 

791
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:48,670
 Tonight? 

792
01:14:49,962 --> 01:14:51,953
 Maybe ... 

793
01:14:52,105 --> 01:14:54,061
 I do not know ... 

794
01:14:54,269 --> 01:14:56,305
 But we have to be ready. 

795
01:14:56,883 --> 01:14:58,874
 you think he could hurt us? 

796
01:14:59,064 --> 01:15:02,022
 mother and I will ensure
it's not going to happen. 

797
01:15:03,914 --> 01:15:05,905
 Why not call the police? 

798
01:15:07,859 --> 01:15:09,850
 They will not understand. 

799
01:15:09,868 --> 01:15:11,859
 We're on our own. 

800
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:20,880
 Whatever happens tonight ... 

801
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,318
Do not let your brother 
lost his eye, okay? 

802
01:15:57,082 --> 01:15:59,038
 Who wants to see
fireworks? 

803
01:15:59,066 --> 01:16:00,943
 How? 

804
01:16:00,977 --> 01:16:02,968
 We were stuck at home. 

805
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:06,511
 We can see on tv. 

806
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:56,469
 Sammy. 

807
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:00,757
 Do you remember the first time
celebrate Independence Day? 

808
01:17:00,773 --> 01:17:04,216
 When he visited his uncle John,
in San Francisco? 

809
01:17:04,237 --> 01:17:06,273
 uncle who has a boat? 

810
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,391
 Yes, Uncle John's boat. 

811
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:14,319
 you remember when he said that the fire
like fireworks ... 

812
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,471
 ice cream? 

813
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:22,313
 That's right ... ice cream 

814
01:17:28,245 --> 01:17:31,412
 And you, Jesse, remember the first day
celebrate Independence? 

815
01:17:35,071 --> 01:17:37,062
 Are in an old house ... 

816
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,312
 And you and Mom woke me up ... 

817
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,509
 And you put me
on the shoulders of ... 

818
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:47,398
 And take me to the top of Whites Hill. 

819
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,957
 you remember the word when we get there? 

820
01:17:56,015 --> 01:17:58,081
 I said I wanted to go home. 

821
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:02,632
 Yes. 

822
01:18:02,645 --> 01:18:04,487
 I bring to it ... 

823
01:18:04,503 --> 01:18:06,603

fireworks fireworks ... 

824
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,611
 And you do not care one bit. 

825
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,432
 Lacy, bring the kids up! 

826
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:32,441
 No, we must stick together! 

827
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,436
 We have to stick together! 

828
01:18:35,456 --> 01:18:37,485

 I ruined everything. 

849
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,899

 "Parents suspects in

858
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:10,312
 THREE MONTHS LATER 

859
01:26:11,977 --> 01:26:15,856
 No. .. I know you do not believe,

 Remember when Jesse was born she has been sick? 

866
