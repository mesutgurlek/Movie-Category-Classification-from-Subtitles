1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,837
<i>Lilith was
the final seal.</i>

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,406
I killed her,
and I set, Lucifer free.

3
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,909
You sons of bitches
jump-started judgement day!

4
00:00:09,944 --> 00:00:11,010
It's apocalypse now.

5
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:12,679
Raphael,
where is he?

6
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:15,616
God? He's dead, Castiel.

7
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:18,652
- you know who I am.
- Lucifer.

8
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:21,488
- You're the one, Sam. you're my true vessel.
- That'll never happen.

9
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,156
<i>You're
the, Michael sword.</i>

10
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,958
- What do you mean, I'm the sword?
- You're Michael's weapon.

11
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:26,826
- I'm a vessel?
- You're the vessel.

12
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,528
Aaah!

13
00:00:28,563 --> 00:00:30,297
You got a trickster
on your hands.

14
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:31,665
So, what is it...
spirit, demon?

15
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:32,932
More like demigods.

16
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,033
They're immortal,

17
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:36,303
and they can create things
out of thin air.

18
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:38,672
Usually with a sense of humour...
deadly pranks.

19
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:39,973
Okay, another thing
Bobby mentioned

20
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,675
Was that these suckers
have a real sweet tooth.

21
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,109
so this is fun for you?

22
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:44,745
Killing, Dean
over and over again?

23
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,846
Sam, there's a lesson here.

24
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:49,215
- What lesson?
- Dean's your weakness.

25
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,850
The bad guys know it, too.

26
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:52,619
He's gonna be the death
of you, Sam.

27
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:02,162
<i>"supernatural" is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

28
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,940
I'm gonna need
a bigger mouth.

29
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,081
Hey, there, Sam.
what's happening?

30
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:23,382
Oh, nothing.

31
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,552
Um... just the 
end of the world.

32
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,091
You're gonna need
a bigger mouth.

33
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,530
Hey, uh... have you done
your research yet?

34
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:42,902
Oh, yeah.

35
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,238
All kinds of research.
all night.

36
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,606
Yeah? huh.

37
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:53,713
Oh, Dean...

38
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,851
We have some more 
"research" to do.

39
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,856
Dean...

40
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:06,860
Son of a bitch!

41
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,797


42
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,499


43
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,068


44
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,736


45
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,704


46
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:22,708


47
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:28,915


48
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:32,218


49
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:38,324


50
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:43,963


51
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:53,106


52
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,945


53
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:18,264


54
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:22,835


55
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,539


56
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,674


57
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,678
<i>Dr. Piccolo: Doctor...</i>

58
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,513
What are you watching?

59
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,115
It's a hospital show.

60
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,485
"Dr. sexy, M.D."
I think it's based on a book.

61
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,389
when did you hit menopause?

62
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,658
It's called
channel-surfing.

63
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,361
You ready?

64
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,064
Are you?

65
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:54,867
One more time...
the F.B.I. is here why, exactly?

66
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,769
Well, it might have
something to do

67
00:03:55,853 --> 00:03:57,854
With one of your locals
getting his head ripped off.

68
00:03:57,889 --> 00:03:59,456
Bill Randolph died
from a bear attack.

69
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,042
How sure are you
that it was a bear?

70
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,442
What else would it be?

71
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:04,711
Well, whatever it was,

72
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,047
It chased Mr. Randolph
through the woods,

73
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:09,582
Smashed through his front door,
followed him up the stairs,

74
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,085
and killed him
in his bedroom.

75
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,287
Is that common...
a bear doing all that?

76
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,589
Depends how 
pissed off it is, I guess.

77
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:20,226
Look, the Randolph's lived
way up in high country.

78
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,796
You got trout runs that'll 
make a grown man weep...

79
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,863
And bears.

80
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:25,565
Right. Now, what 
about Mrs. Randolph?

81
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,801
The file says
she saw the whole thing.

82
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:30,937
Yes, she did. My heart goes out
to that poor woman.

83
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,572
She said bear?

84
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:38,678
Kathy Randolph went through
a hell of a trauma.

85
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:40,113
She's confused.

86
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,450
What did she say?

87
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,519
No. I-it must have been a bear.

88
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:50,289
I-I mean, what else 
could it have been?

89
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:53,159
Mrs. Randolph...

90
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:54,761
What did you think it was?

91
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,299
No. I-I remember clearly now.

92
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:02,602
It was definitely a bear.

93
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,003
We're sure it was.

94
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:07,573
But see, it... it helps us
to hear, uh, every angle.

95
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:10,043
So, just tell us
what you thought you saw.

96
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:16,182
Well, it's impossible, but...

97
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,453
I could have sworn I saw...

98
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:24,190
the incredible Hulk.

99
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,697
The incredible Hulk.

100
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,699
I told you.
it's crazy.

101
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,002
You, um...

102
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,706
Bana or Norton?

103
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,042
Oh, no.
those movies were terrible.

104
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:44,343
The TV Hulk.

105
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,212
Lou Ferrigno?

106
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:47,213
Yes.

107
00:05:47,248 --> 00:05:49,382
- Spiky-hair, Lou Ferrigno? 
- Yes.

108
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,784
Huh.

109
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,220
Oh, you think
I'm crazy.

110
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:56,890
No, uh...

111
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:59,692
No, I-it's just...
is...

112
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,928
Is there, uh...

113
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,764
Would there be any reason

114
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,533
That, Lou ferrigno,
the incredible hulk,

115
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,936
Um, would have a grudge
against your husband?

116
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,673
No.

117
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,609
No.

118
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,547
Hey.

119
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,682
Find anything?

120
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,651
Well, uh,
I saw the house.

121
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,353
And?

122
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,655
And there is
a giant 8-foot-wide hole

123
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,724
Where the front door
used to be.

124
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,860
Almost like...
a hulk-sized hole.

125
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,197
Maybe.
what do you got?

126
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,700
Well, it turns out that, 
Bill Randolph had quite the temper.

127
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,838
Uh, he's got two counts
of spousal battery, bar brawls,

128
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:48,107
And court-ordered
anger-management sessions.

129
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:51,677
You might say you wouldn't
like him when he's angry.

130
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,583
So, a hothead getting killed
by TV's greatest hothead.

131
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,786
Kind of sounds like
just deserts, doesn't it?

132
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,189
it's all starting to make sense.

133
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:05,024
How is it
starting to make sense?

134
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:07,393
Well, I found something else
at the crime scene.

135
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,196
Candy wrappers.

136
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,733
Lots of 'em.

137
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,304
Just deserts,
sweet tooth,

138
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:20,907
Screwing with people
before you kill them.

139
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,642
We're dealing with
the, Trickster, aren't we?

140
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,411
Sure looks like.

141
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,679
Good.

142
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:30,917
Been wanting to gank that 
mother since mystery spot.

143
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:31,918
You sure?

144
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,120
Yeah, I'm sure.

145
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,589
No, I mean, are you sure
you want to kill him?

146
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,558
Son of a bitch didn't
think twice about icing me...

147
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:40,894
- A thousand times.
- No. I know.

148
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:43,462
- I-I mean, I'm just saying.
- What are you saying?

149
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,431
If you don't want 
to kill him, then what?

150
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,802
- Talk to him.
- What?

151
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,105
Look, think about it, Dean.

152
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,275
He's one of the most powerful
creatures we've ever met.

153
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,575
Maybe we can use him.

154
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,511
For what?

155
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:01,014
Okay, Trickster's like a...
like a, Hugh Hefner type, right?

156
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:02,148
Wine, women, song.

157
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,350
Maybe he doesn't want
the party to end.

158
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:07,120
I mean, maybe he hates this "angels and 
demons" stuff as much as we do.

159
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,654
Maybe he'll help us.

160
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,856
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

161
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,258
Ally with the, Trickster?

162
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:14,127
Yeah.

163
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:18,697
A bloody,
violent monster...

164
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,533
And you want to be
face book friends with him?

165
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,335
Nice, Sammy.

166
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,170
The world is gonna end, Dean.

167
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:26,172
We don't have the luxury
of a moral stand.

168
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,808
I'm just saying,
it's worth a shot. that's all.

169
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:32,511
If it doesn't work...
we'll kill him.

170
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,849
How we gonna find 
the guy, anyway?

171
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,285
Well, he never takes
just one victim, right?

172
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,653
He'll show.

173
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,531
<i>Uh, dispatch?
I got a possible 187</i>

174
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:54,500
<i>out here at the old paper mill
on route 6.</i>

175
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:55,635
Hey.

176
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,903
<i>Roger that.</i>

177
00:08:55,938 --> 00:08:56,939
<i>What are you 
looking at there, son?</i>

178
00:08:56,973 --> 00:08:59,474
<i>honestly, Walt,
I wouldn't even know</i>

179
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:01,109
<i>how to describe
what I'm seeing.</i>

180
00:09:01,143 --> 00:09:03,579
<i>Just, um,
send everybody.</i>

181
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,580
Al right, stay calm, 
stay by your car.

182
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:06,581
Helps on your way.

183
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,547
That sounds weird.

184
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:09,883
Weird enough
to be our guy?

185
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,093
There was
a murder here...

186
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,962
And there's no police 
cars... there's nobody.

187
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:25,331
How does that look to you?

188
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,133
Crappy.

189
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,954
What the hell?

190
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:51,957
Doctor.

191
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:53,492
Doctor.

192
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,328
"Doctor"?

193
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,263


194
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,032


195
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,801


196
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,404


197
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,207
Doctor.

198
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:09,208
Ow!

199
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:10,643
- Seriously? 
- What?

200
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,379
Seriously, you're brilliant,
you know that?

201
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:16,082
And a coward.
you're a brilliant coward.

202
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,684
Uh, what are you
talking about?

203
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:22,455
As if you don't know.

204
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,225
I don't believe this.

205
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,994
What?

206
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,728
That was Dr. Piccolo.

207
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:30,696
Who?

208
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,898
Dr. Ellen Piccolo.

209
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:37,803
The sexy-yet-earnest doctor at...

210
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,142
Seattle Mercy Hospital.

211
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:45,578
Uh, Dean...

212
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:48,014
What the hell
are you talking about?

213
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:51,084
The doctor get ups.
the... the... the sexy interns.

214
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,686
The "seriouslys."
it all makes sense.

215
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,288
What makes sense?
what's going on?

216
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,790
We're in
"Dr. Sexy, E.M.D."

217
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:10,390
- Dude, what the hell?
- I don't know.

218
00:11:10,424 --> 00:11:12,825
- No, seriously. What the hell?
- I don't know.

219
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:14,227
One theory. Any theory.

220
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:16,563
Uh, the trickster trapped us
in TV land.

221
00:11:16,597 --> 00:11:18,631
That's your theory?
that's stupid.

222
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,401
You're the one who said
we're on "Dr. Sexy, M.D."

223
00:11:21,435 --> 00:11:23,035
Yeah, but TV land
isn't TV land.

224
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,505
I mean, there's actors
a-and lights and crew members.

225
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:27,574
- You know? this looks real.
- It can't be.

226
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:29,309
Dean, how can this
possibly be real?

227
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:32,312
I don't know.
all right?

228
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:34,780
Oh, but there goes Dr. Wang,

229
00:11:34,815 --> 00:11:38,751
The sexy-but-arrogant
heart surgeon.

230
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:41,721
And there's, Johnny Drake.

231
00:11:41,755 --> 00:11:45,291
Oh, he's not even alive.
he's a ghost in the mind of...

232
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,364
of her, the sexy-but-neurotic
doctor over there.

233
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:56,703
<i>so, this show has ghosts?
why?</i>

234
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:58,571
<i>I don't know.
it is compelling.</i>

235
00:11:58,606 --> 00:12:00,673
I thought you said
you aren't a fan.

236
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,809
<i>I'm not.
I'm not.</i>

237
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:07,380
Oh, boy.

238
00:12:07,414 --> 00:12:09,616
What?

239
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,351
- It's him.
- Who?

240
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:17,757
It's him. It's Dr. sexy.

241
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:21,694
Doctor.

242
00:12:21,729 --> 00:12:23,563
Doctor.

243
00:12:23,597 --> 00:12:24,897
Doctor.

244
00:12:24,931 --> 00:12:26,799


245
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:27,867


246
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:28,934
Doctor.

247
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:31,771
You want to give me
one good reason

248
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:33,806
Why you defied
my direct order

249
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,176
To do the experimental
face transplant on Mrs. Beale?

250
00:12:40,381 --> 00:12:41,381
One reason?

251
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:42,615
Hmm?

252
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,951
Sure.

253
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:53,760
You're not Dr. Sexy.

254
00:12:53,794 --> 00:12:54,761
You're crazy.

255
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:56,296
Really?

256
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,499
'cause I swore part of 
what makes Dr. Sexy, sexy

257
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:01,967
Is the fact that he 
wears cowboys boots...

258
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:03,303
Not tennis shoes.

259
00:13:03,337 --> 00:13:05,004
Yeah, you're not a fan.

260
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:07,106
It's a guilty pleasure.

261
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,775
Call security.

262
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:12,645
Yeah, go ahead, pal.
see, we know what you are.

263
00:13:20,754 --> 00:13:22,655
You guys
are getting better.

264
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,457
Get us the 
hell out of here.

265
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:26,693
Or what?

266
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:30,830
Don't see your 
wooden stakes, big guy.

267
00:13:30,864 --> 00:13:34,200
That was you on the police
scanner, right? this is a trick.

268
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:36,369
Hello-o-o?

269
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:38,103
Trickster?

270
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:40,773
Come on! I heard you 
two yahoos were in town.

271
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:43,008
How could I resist?
where the hell are we?

272
00:13:43,043 --> 00:13:46,212
You like it?
It's all home-made.

273
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:50,182
My own sets,
my own actors.

274
00:13:50,217 --> 00:13:53,118
Call it my own 
little idiot box.

275
00:13:53,153 --> 00:13:54,454
How do we get out?

276
00:13:54,488 --> 00:13:57,490
That, my friend,
is the $64 question.

277
00:13:57,524 --> 00:13:58,991
Whatever. We just...

278
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:01,026
We need to talk to you.
we need your help.

279
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:03,996
Hmm.

280
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,331
Let me guess.

281
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:08,000
You two mutton heads
broke the world,

282
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:10,570
and you want me
to sweep up your mess?

283
00:14:10,604 --> 00:14:12,104
Please.

284
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:14,674
Just five minutes.
hear us out.

285
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,377
Sure. Tell you what.

286
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:20,988
Survive the next 24 hours, we'll talk.

287
00:14:21,014 --> 00:14:22,248
Survive what?

288
00:14:22,282 --> 00:14:24,250
The game.

289
00:14:24,284 --> 00:14:26,085
What game?

290
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:27,453
You're in it.

291
00:14:29,122 --> 00:14:30,256
How do we play?

292
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,091
You're playing it.

293
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,993
What are the rules?

294
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:40,966
Oh, son of a bitch.

295
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:43,969
Dr. Sexy?

296
00:14:44,872 --> 00:14:47,373
Dr. Sexy?

297
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:53,913
<i>paging Dr. Sexy.
report to the E.R.</i>

298
00:14:53,947 --> 00:14:56,315
Oh, by the way...
talking with monsters?

299
00:14:56,349 --> 00:14:57,316
Hell of a plan.

300
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,985
Just... What do we do now?

301
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,188
You know what 
I'm doing? Leaving.

302
00:15:03,223 --> 00:15:05,291
Lady... what the hell?

303
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:08,461
You are
a brilliant, brilliant...

304
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:10,463
Yeah, a coward.
you already said that.

305
00:15:10,497 --> 00:15:12,197
But I got news for you.

306
00:15:12,232 --> 00:15:14,133
I am not a doctor.

307
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,937
Don't say that.

308
00:15:17,971 --> 00:15:21,641
You are the finest
Cerebrovascular Neurosurgeon

309
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:25,077
I have ever met...
and I have met plenty.

310
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:27,279
So that girl died
on your table.

311
00:15:27,314 --> 00:15:30,583
It wasn't your fault.
it wasn't anybody's fault.

312
00:15:30,617 --> 00:15:33,052
Sometimes people just die.

313
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:37,289
I have no idea
what you're saying to me.

314
00:15:37,324 --> 00:15:40,159
You're afraid.

315
00:15:40,193 --> 00:15:44,964
You're afraid to operate again,
and you're afraid to love.

316
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:48,601


317
00:15:48,635 --> 00:15:51,604
Yeah, we're getting out of here.

318
00:15:51,638 --> 00:15:52,872
Hey, doctor.

319
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:54,073
Yes?

320
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:56,676
My wife needs
that face transplant.

321
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,244
Okay. You know what, pal?

322
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,580
None of this is real, okay?

323
00:16:00,614 --> 00:16:03,315
And your wife
doesn't need, Jack squat.

324
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,684
Okay?

325
00:16:06,753 --> 00:16:09,088


326
00:16:09,122 --> 00:16:11,090
Hey, doctor.

327
00:16:11,658 --> 00:16:12,625
Ugh!

328
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:15,027


329
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:16,796
Real! it's real!

330
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,930
No, no, no. ohh!

331
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:21,400
No, no, no, no, no!
hey! We need a doctor!

332
00:16:21,434 --> 00:16:25,471


333
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:33,813


334
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:34,881


335
00:16:34,915 --> 00:16:37,149
B.P. is 80 over 50...
and dropping.

336
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:44,757
Doctor?

337
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,628
What?

338
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:53,833


339
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:56,068
Sam, do something.
come on.

340
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:59,071
I don't know how to use
any of this crap.

341
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:00,205
Figure it out!

342
00:17:04,444 --> 00:17:07,013
Sam! come on. I'm waiting.

343
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:10,516
Okay, um, I need a...

344
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:14,086
Penknife,
some dental floss,

345
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,924
A sewing needle,
and a fifth of whiskey.

346
00:17:22,863 --> 00:17:24,463
Stat!

347
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:33,238


348
00:17:33,273 --> 00:17:35,340
We okay?
how's it looking?

349
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,209
Yep. You'll be fine.

350
00:17:37,243 --> 00:17:38,210


351
00:17:38,244 --> 00:17:42,181


352
00:17:42,215 --> 00:17:45,585


353
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:48,287


354
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:51,891


355
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:53,759


356
00:17:53,794 --> 00:17:54,827


357
00:17:54,861 --> 00:17:56,028


358
00:18:09,776 --> 00:18:13,879
Let's play, "Nut-Cracker"!

359
00:18:26,526 --> 00:18:29,095
Sam Winchester...

360
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:37,803
Countdown.

361
00:18:37,838 --> 00:18:38,938
What?

362
00:18:38,972 --> 00:18:40,205
Uh...

363
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,374
- What am I supposed to say?
- You think I know?

364
00:18:42,408 --> 00:18:45,511
Uh, I-I don't... I don't
understand, uh, Japanese.

365
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:54,586
Is he screwing with me?

366
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:57,422
I-I-I-I-I can't speak, Japanese...

367
00:19:03,797 --> 00:19:05,865
Ruby.

368
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:10,269
I'm sorry, Sam Winchester.

369
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:12,738
Sorry? Sorry for what?

370
00:19:12,773 --> 00:19:14,473
<i>Dean.</i>

371
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:17,710
Ohhh!

372
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:20,980
Whoa! "Nut-Cracker"!

373
00:19:25,652 --> 00:19:29,889
Whoa! "Nut-Cracker"!

374
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:33,693
Sam?

375
00:19:33,727 --> 00:19:35,027
yeah?!

376
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:37,262
Hello, Chikato-San?

377
00:19:38,031 --> 00:19:40,132
Hai?

378
00:19:47,774 --> 00:19:49,108
You okay?

379
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:01,187
Now what?

380
00:20:02,388 --> 00:20:04,090
Cass?

381
00:20:05,525 --> 00:20:06,726
Is this another trick?

382
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,528
It's me. Uh, what 
are you doing here?

383
00:20:09,562 --> 00:20:10,696
Us? What are you doing here?

384
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:12,865
Looking for you. You've 
been missing for days.

385
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:14,366
So get us the hell 
out of here, then.

386
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,202
<i>Let's go.</i>

387
00:20:16,236 --> 00:20:18,104
Cass.

388
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:21,506
No, no, no, no.

389
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:26,411
Mr. Trickster does not like
pretty-boy angels.

390
00:20:28,581 --> 00:20:31,283
Hmm?

391
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:39,925
Dean Winchester...

392
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,533
Countdown.

393
00:20:48,568 --> 00:20:50,302
What do I do? What do I do?
I don't want to get hit in the nuts.

394
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:52,071
I-I know. Uh, uh...

395
00:20:52,105 --> 00:20:54,573
- J-just, um... wait.
- What?!

396
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:55,941
- I played a doctor.
- What?!

397
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:59,245
- In... in "Dr. Sexy." I played a doctor. I operated.
- So?

398
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,946
So, I played the role
the, Trickster wanted me to play.

399
00:21:00,981 --> 00:21:02,581
May... maybe we just
have to go along with it.

400
00:21:02,615 --> 00:21:04,551
- Go along with what?
- With the game. I mean, 

401
00:21:04,585 --> 00:21:06,451
we're on a game show, right? 
So, just answer the question.

402
00:21:06,486 --> 00:21:07,653
- In, Japanese?
- Yeah.

403
00:21:07,687 --> 00:21:08,888
- I don't know Japanese!
- Try!

404
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:13,659
Damn it!

405
00:21:35,715 --> 00:21:41,120
Dean Winchester...
"Nut-Cracker", Champion!

406
00:21:41,154 --> 00:21:42,754
How did you do that!

407
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:44,123
I have no idea.

408
00:21:44,157 --> 00:21:45,424
So, that's it.

409
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,260
We play our roles,
we survive.

410
00:21:48,295 --> 00:21:50,662
Yeah. Play our roles
for how long?

411
00:21:50,697 --> 00:21:52,431
Good question.

412
00:22:06,012 --> 00:22:08,280
I've got genital herpes.

413
00:22:08,315 --> 00:22:10,649
I've got genital herpes.

414
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,987
Seriously?

415
00:22:15,021 --> 00:22:17,890
Hey, you're the one
who said play our roles.

416
00:22:17,924 --> 00:22:20,059
- So, uh...
- Yeah, right.

417
00:22:22,662 --> 00:22:25,564
I've got genital herpes.

418
00:22:25,598 --> 00:22:27,466
I tried to be responsible.

419
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:30,535
Did I try.

420
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,907
But now I take
twice-daily, Herpexia

421
00:22:34,941 --> 00:22:37,709
To reduce my chances
of passing it on.

422
00:22:37,744 --> 00:22:39,778
Ask your doctor
about using, Herpexia.

423
00:22:39,812 --> 00:22:42,147
<i>patients should always
consult with a physician</i>

424
00:22:42,182 --> 00:22:44,049
<i>before using Herpexia.</i>

425
00:22:44,084 --> 00:22:45,584
<i>possible side effects include</i>

426
00:22:45,618 --> 00:22:47,887
<i>headache, diarrhoea,
permanent erectile dysfunction,</i>

427
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:51,621
<i>thoughts of suicide,
and nausea.</i>

428
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:53,893
I am doing all I can

429
00:22:53,927 --> 00:22:57,329
To slightly lessen
the spread of...

430
00:22:57,364 --> 00:23:01,767
Of... genital herpes.

431
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:04,103
And that's a good thing.

432
00:23:10,804 --> 00:23:12,604
We now return to, Supernatural.

433
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:15,622
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

434
00:23:21,126 --> 00:23:23,829
I am really, really
very sorry,

435
00:23:23,863 --> 00:23:25,731
But...

436
00:23:25,765 --> 00:23:28,299
We've got
some work to do.

437
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:30,536
<i>But we
did do work....</i>

438
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,037
In depth.

439
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:43,749
How long do we
have to keep doing this?

440
00:23:45,652 --> 00:23:46,852
I don't know.

441
00:23:49,188 --> 00:23:50,789
Maybe forever?

442
00:23:52,425 --> 00:23:53,926
We might die in here.

443
00:23:55,428 --> 00:23:57,629
How is that funny?

444
00:23:57,664 --> 00:23:58,664
Vultures.

445
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:02,668
<i>You okay?</i>

446
00:24:02,702 --> 00:24:04,469
- I don't have much time.
- What happened?

447
00:24:04,503 --> 00:24:06,738
- I got out.
- From where?

448
00:24:06,773 --> 00:24:08,707
Listen to me.
something is not right.

449
00:24:08,741 --> 00:24:10,676
This thing is much more 
powerful than it should be.

450
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,578
- What thing... the, Trickster?
- If it is a, Trickster.

451
00:24:12,612 --> 00:24:13,679
What do you mean?

452
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:17,883
Hello!

453
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:20,819
<i>Thank you!</i>

454
00:24:20,853 --> 00:24:22,654
Thank you.

455
00:24:22,689 --> 00:24:23,989
Stop.

456
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:27,292
Hi, Castiel.

457
00:24:30,563 --> 00:24:32,731
- You know him?
- Where did you just send him?

458
00:24:32,765 --> 00:24:35,200
Relax. He'll live.

459
00:24:35,234 --> 00:24:36,702
Umm... Maybe.

460
00:24:38,204 --> 00:24:42,273
You know what, I'm done with 
the monkey dance, okay? We get it.

461
00:24:42,308 --> 00:24:45,077
Yeah? get what, hotshot?

462
00:24:45,111 --> 00:24:47,946
Playing our roles, right?
that's your game?

463
00:24:47,981 --> 00:24:50,048
- That's half the game.
- What's the other half?

464
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:52,050
Play your roles
out there.

465
00:24:52,085 --> 00:24:53,585
What's that
supposed to mean?

466
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,688
You know...
Sam, starring as, Lucifer.

467
00:24:56,723 --> 00:24:59,224
Dean, starring as, Michael.

468
00:24:59,258 --> 00:25:03,361
Your celebrity death match.
play your roles.

469
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:05,764
You want us to say yes
to those sons of bitches?

470
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:08,533
Hells, yeah.
let's light this candle!

471
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:10,702
We do that,
the world will end.

472
00:25:10,737 --> 00:25:15,573
Yeah? and whose fault is that?

473
00:25:15,608 --> 00:25:19,511
Who popped, Lucifer
out of the box, hmm?

474
00:25:19,545 --> 00:25:23,248
Look, it's started.
You started it.

475
00:25:23,282 --> 00:25:26,685
It can't be stopped.
So, let's get it over with.

476
00:25:28,655 --> 00:25:31,422
Heaven or hell...
which side you on?

477
00:25:31,457 --> 00:25:33,424
I'm not on either side.

478
00:25:33,459 --> 00:25:34,660
Yeah, right.

479
00:25:34,694 --> 00:25:37,129
You're grabbing ankle
for, Michael or, Lucifer.

480
00:25:37,163 --> 00:25:39,931
Which one is it?

481
00:25:39,966 --> 00:25:42,834
You listen to me,
you arrogant dick.

482
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:46,672
I don't work for either
of those S.O.B.s, believe me.

483
00:25:46,706 --> 00:25:49,607
Hmm.
Oh, you're somebody's bitch.

484
00:25:52,545 --> 00:25:56,982
Don't you ever, ever presume
to know what I am.

485
00:26:04,157 --> 00:26:05,957
Now, listen very closely.

486
00:26:05,992 --> 00:26:07,826
Here's what's gonna happen.

487
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,462
You're gonna suck it up,
accept your responsibilities,

488
00:26:11,497 --> 00:26:14,866
And play the roles that
destiny has chosen for you.

489
00:26:14,901 --> 00:26:16,334
And if we don't?

490
00:26:20,272 --> 00:26:23,208
Then you'll stay here
in TV land...

491
00:26:23,242 --> 00:26:24,242
Forever.

492
00:26:28,014 --> 00:26:31,183
300 channels and, uh,
nothings on.

493
00:26:51,204 --> 00:26:53,205
Oh, come on.

494
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:54,472
So, what do you think?

495
00:26:54,506 --> 00:26:56,208
What do I think?

496
00:26:56,242 --> 00:26:58,210
I think go screw yourself,
that's what I think.

497
00:26:58,244 --> 00:27:00,178
Uh, can you give 
us a sec, please?

498
00:27:00,213 --> 00:27:01,947
Thanks.

499
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:04,182
- You got to calm down.
- Calm down?

500
00:27:04,217 --> 00:27:05,984
I am wearing sunglasses at night.

501
00:27:06,018 --> 00:27:08,319
You know who does that?
No-talent douche bags.

502
00:27:08,354 --> 00:27:10,055
I hate this game.

503
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:12,323
I hate that we're in 
a procedural cop show.

504
00:27:12,358 --> 00:27:13,625
And you want to know why?

505
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:15,560
Because I hate
procedural cop shows!

506
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:18,263
There's like 300 of them on 
television. They're all the freakin' same.

507
00:27:18,297 --> 00:27:21,366
It's, "ooh, a plane
crashed here." Oh, shut up!

508
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,734
- Hey.
- What?

509
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:26,004
Check out sweet 
tooth over there.

510
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:32,177
Think that's him?

511
00:27:32,211 --> 00:27:34,746
Just, uh,
follow my lead.

512
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,551


513
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,531
You, uh, you okay?

514
00:27:53,565 --> 00:27:55,500
Yeah.

515
00:27:55,534 --> 00:27:56,868
What do we got?

516
00:27:58,304 --> 00:28:01,940
Well, aside from the ligature
marks around his neck,

517
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:03,641
He has what appears to be

518
00:28:03,676 --> 00:28:06,611
A roll of quarters
jammed down his throat.

519
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:12,550
Well, I say...

520
00:28:12,584 --> 00:28:13,751
Jackpot.

521
00:28:13,786 --> 00:28:14,953
Hmm.

522
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:16,788
Also...

523
00:28:16,823 --> 00:28:19,557
There was a stab wound
to the lower abdomen there.

524
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:31,203
Well, I say...

525
00:28:33,105 --> 00:28:35,140
No guts, no glory.

526
00:28:36,342 --> 00:28:39,711
Get that guy a...

527
00:28:39,745 --> 00:28:41,313
Tums.

528
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:45,984
Gutter ball.

529
00:28:48,154 --> 00:28:49,787
That's a good one, guys.

530
00:29:17,149 --> 00:29:19,251
Ha ha!

531
00:29:19,285 --> 00:29:20,886
You got the wrong guy, idiot.

532
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,487
Did we?

533
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:54,369
I'm worried, man...

534
00:29:54,403 --> 00:29:56,670
What that S.O.B. did to, Cass.

535
00:29:56,705 --> 00:29:58,539
You know, where is he?

536
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:01,509
Sam?

537
00:30:04,446 --> 00:30:06,547
Where are you?

538
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:11,285
It's Sam. Leave me a message.

539
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,889
Sam, it's me.

540
00:30:14,923 --> 00:30:17,925
Where the hell did you go?

541
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:19,394
<i>Dean?</i>

542
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,165
Sam?

543
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:26,167
Where are you?

544
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:28,036
<i>I don't know.</i>

545
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,537
<i>Oh, crap.</i>

546
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:32,407
<i>I don't think we killed
the, Trickster.</i>

547
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:55,430
Okay, stake didn't work.

548
00:30:55,464 --> 00:30:58,099
- So, what? this another trick?
- I don't know.

549
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:00,601
<i>Maybe the stake didn't work
because it's not a, Trickster.</i>

550
00:31:00,635 --> 00:31:03,104
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you heard, Cass.

551
00:31:03,138 --> 00:31:05,440
He said this thing was
too powerful to be a, Trickster.

552
00:31:05,474 --> 00:31:07,442
Yeah, and did you notice
the way he looked at, Cass?

553
00:31:07,476 --> 00:31:08,642
Almost like he knew him.

554
00:31:08,677 --> 00:31:10,078
and how pissed he got,

555
00:31:10,112 --> 00:31:12,780
when you brought up
Michael and Lucifer.

556
00:31:12,814 --> 00:31:14,882
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

557
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:17,318
I think I know
what we're dealing with.

558
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,398
- Dean?
- What?

559
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:33,367
That, um, feels 
really uncomfortable.

560
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,904
Oww. 

561
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:39,440
You sure this is gonna work?

562
00:31:39,475 --> 00:31:41,309
No, but I have no other ideas.

563
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:50,151
All right, you son of a bitch!

564
00:31:50,185 --> 00:31:51,885
Uncle!

565
00:31:53,855 --> 00:31:56,957
We'll do it!

566
00:31:56,992 --> 00:31:58,159
Should I honk?

567
00:31:59,495 --> 00:32:01,262
Wow.

568
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:04,132
Sam, get a load
of the rims on you.

569
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:06,501
Eat me. 

570
00:32:06,535 --> 00:32:11,139
Okay, boys,
ready to go quietly?

571
00:32:11,173 --> 00:32:13,541
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast.

572
00:32:13,575 --> 00:32:16,210
Nobody's going anywhere
until, Sam has opposable thumbs.

573
00:32:16,245 --> 00:32:17,478
What's the difference?

574
00:32:17,513 --> 00:32:20,114
Satan's gonna ride his ass
one way or another.

575
00:32:32,794 --> 00:32:34,462
Happy?

576
00:32:35,564 --> 00:32:38,866
Tell me one thing.
Why didn't the stake kill you?

577
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,769
I am the, Trickster.

578
00:32:41,803 --> 00:32:43,538
But maybe you're not.

579
00:32:50,744 --> 00:32:52,680
Maybe you've always been an angel.

580
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:56,617
A what?!

581
00:32:56,652 --> 00:32:59,253
Somebody slip a mickey
in your power shake, kid?

582
00:32:59,288 --> 00:33:00,821
I'll tell you what.

583
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:03,457
You just jump out
of the holy fire,

584
00:33:03,492 --> 00:33:05,959
and we'll call it
our mistake.

585
00:33:18,173 --> 00:33:22,076
Well played, boys.
Well played.

586
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,846
Where'd you get
the holy oil?

587
00:33:25,981 --> 00:33:28,183
Oh, you might say
we pulled it out of, Sam's ass.

588
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:32,653
Where'd I screw up?

589
00:33:32,687 --> 00:33:34,021
You didn't.

590
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:35,956
Nobody gets the jump 
on, Cass like you did.

591
00:33:35,991 --> 00:33:38,559
Mostly, it was the way
you talked about, Armageddon.

592
00:33:38,593 --> 00:33:40,460
Meaning?

593
00:33:40,495 --> 00:33:42,763
Well, call it
personal experience.

594
00:33:42,797 --> 00:33:44,231
Nobody gets that angry

595
00:33:44,265 --> 00:33:47,234
unless they're talking
about their own family.

596
00:33:49,337 --> 00:33:53,206
So, which one are you?
Grumpy, Sneezy, or Douchey?

597
00:33:56,344 --> 00:33:59,847
Gabriel, okay?

598
00:33:59,881 --> 00:34:02,049
They call me, Gabriel.

599
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:05,485
Gabriel? The Archangel?

600
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,088
Guilty.

601
00:34:08,122 --> 00:34:11,725
Okay, Gabriel. How does
an Archangel become a, Trickster?

602
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,762
My own private
witness protection.

603
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:18,666
I skipped out of heaven,
had a face transplant,

604
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,769
Carved out my own 
little corner of the world...

605
00:34:21,803 --> 00:34:23,971
Till you two
screwed it all up.

606
00:34:24,005 --> 00:34:26,574
And what did daddy say when 
you ran off and joined the pagans?

607
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:29,743
Daddy doesn't say anything
about anything.

608
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:31,912
Then what happened?
Why'd you ditch?

609
00:34:31,947 --> 00:34:34,414
Well, do you blame him?

610
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,450
I mean, his brothers are 
heavyweight douche-nozzles.

611
00:34:36,484 --> 00:34:37,751
Shut your cake hole.

612
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:40,821
You don't know anything
about my family.

613
00:34:40,855 --> 00:34:45,960
I loved my father.
My brothers... love them.

614
00:34:45,994 --> 00:34:48,161
But watching them
turn on each other?

615
00:34:48,196 --> 00:34:49,797
Tear at each 
other's throats?

616
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:53,033
I couldn't bear it, okay?!

617
00:34:53,068 --> 00:34:54,935
So I left.

618
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:58,538
And now it's happening
all over again.

619
00:34:58,573 --> 00:34:59,773
Then help us stop it.

620
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:02,442
It can't be stopped.

621
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:04,511
You want to see
the end of the world?

622
00:35:04,545 --> 00:35:06,146
I want it to be over!

623
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,681
I have to sit back

624
00:35:07,716 --> 00:35:10,951
and watch my own brothers kill
each other, thanks to you two!

625
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:14,287
Heaven, Hell...
I don't care who wins!

626
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:16,156
I just want it to be over!

627
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,158
Well, it doesn't
have to be like that.

628
00:35:18,192 --> 00:35:20,293
There has to be some way
to... to pull the plug.

629
00:35:21,362 --> 00:35:24,898
Oh, you do not 
know my family.

630
00:35:24,933 --> 00:35:27,234
What you guys
call the apocalypse

631
00:35:27,268 --> 00:35:29,302
I used to call
Sunday dinner.

632
00:35:29,337 --> 00:35:31,839
That's why there's 
no stopping this...

633
00:35:31,873 --> 00:35:34,441
Because this
isn't about a war.

634
00:35:34,475 --> 00:35:36,844
It's about two brothers
that loved each other

635
00:35:36,878 --> 00:35:39,647
and betrayed each other.

636
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:41,414
You think you'd 
be able to relate.

637
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:43,684
What are you
talking about?

638
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:52,926
You sorry sons of bitches.

639
00:35:52,961 --> 00:35:56,664
Why do you think
you two are the vessels?

640
00:35:56,698 --> 00:35:58,331
Think about it.

641
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:01,001
Michael... the big brother,

642
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:03,170
Loyal to an absent father.

643
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:07,041
And Lucifer...
the little brother,

644
00:36:07,075 --> 00:36:11,812
Rebellious of daddy's plan.

645
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:14,281
You were born to this, boys.

646
00:36:14,315 --> 00:36:16,016
It's your destiny!

647
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:17,751
It was always you!

648
00:36:19,187 --> 00:36:21,588
As it is in heaven...

649
00:36:21,622 --> 00:36:24,858
So it must be
on earth.

650
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:27,761
One brother
has to kill the other.

651
00:36:27,796 --> 00:36:29,362
What the hell
are you saying?

652
00:36:29,397 --> 00:36:34,134
Why do you think I've always
taken such an interest in you?

653
00:36:34,169 --> 00:36:35,836
Because from the moment

654
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:38,672
Dad flipped on the lights
around here,

655
00:36:38,707 --> 00:36:43,376
We knew it was all
gonna end with you.

656
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:44,712
Always.

657
00:36:52,787 --> 00:36:54,287
No.

658
00:36:55,957 --> 00:36:58,291
That's not gonna happen.

659
00:36:58,326 --> 00:37:00,627
I'm sorry...

660
00:37:00,661 --> 00:37:02,295
But it is.

661
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:14,641
Guys, I wish
this were a TV show.

662
00:37:14,675 --> 00:37:18,545
Easy answers, endings 
wrapped up in a bow.

663
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:24,918
But this is real.

664
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:27,888
And it's gonna end 
bloody for all of us.

665
00:37:29,624 --> 00:37:32,860
That's just
how it's got to be.

666
00:37:43,712 --> 00:37:46,314
So... boys.

667
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:47,715
Now what?

668
00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:51,919
Stare at each other
for the rest of eternity?

669
00:37:51,953 --> 00:37:53,487
Well, first of all,

670
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:55,889
you're gonna bring, Cass back
from wherever you stashed him.

671
00:37:55,924 --> 00:37:57,091
Oh, am I?

672
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:58,559
Yeah.

673
00:37:58,594 --> 00:38:01,061
Or we're going to dunk you
in some holy oil

674
00:38:01,096 --> 00:38:03,397
and deep-fry ourselves
an Archangel.

675
00:38:13,442 --> 00:38:16,644
Cass, you okay?

676
00:38:16,678 --> 00:38:17,878
I'm fine.

677
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,117
Hello, Gabriel.

678
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:25,486
Hey, bro.

679
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,955
How's the search 
for daddy going?

680
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:30,023
Let me guess. Awful.

681
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,099
Okay, we're out of here.

682
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:44,572
Come on, Sam.

683
00:38:44,606 --> 00:38:46,540
Okay.

684
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:48,276
Hey... guys?

685
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,711
So... so, what?

686
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:52,112
Huh?

687
00:38:52,147 --> 00:38:55,215
You're just gonna... you're
gonna leave me here forever?

688
00:38:57,452 --> 00:39:00,154
No. We're not.

689
00:39:00,188 --> 00:39:02,992
'cause we don't screw
with people the way you do.

690
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:06,427
And for the record...

691
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:10,331
This isn't about some prizefight
between your brothers,

692
00:39:10,365 --> 00:39:13,467
or some destiny
that can't be stopped!

693
00:39:13,502 --> 00:39:14,868
This is about you

694
00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:17,371
being too afraid to 
stand up to your family!

695
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:43,464
Don't say I never 
did anything for you.

696
00:40:01,883 --> 00:40:04,251
All that stuff he 
was spouting in there,

697
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:06,320
you think he was 
telling the truth?

698
00:40:06,355 --> 00:40:09,923
I think he believes it.

699
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:13,193
So, what do we do?

700
00:40:13,228 --> 00:40:15,195
I don't know.

701
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,598
I'll tell you one thing

702
00:40:17,632 --> 00:40:19,700
right about now, I wish
I was back on a TV show.

703
00:40:21,536 --> 00:40:22,703
Yeah, me too.

704
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,540
