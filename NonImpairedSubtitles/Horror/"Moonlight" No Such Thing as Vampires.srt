1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,150
- Mick St. John,Thank You For Joining Us Tonight.
- You're Welcome.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,630
So,What's Your Life Being A Vampire?

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,760
Being A Vampire Sucks.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,060
It's A Bad Joke, I Know,
But It's The Truth.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,580
- So You Drink Blood?
- Why, You Offering?

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,330
I'm Just Kidding.
Yeah, I-i Have A Guy.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,510
- You Mean, Like A Dealer?
- Yeah, Like A Dealer.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,010
So You Never Bite Anybody?

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,890
No, No... Unless
They Really Ask For It.

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,760
Do You Sleep In A Coffin?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,230
No. That's An Old Wives' Tale.
I Sleep In A Freezer.

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,530
And While We're On The Subject,
Garlic Is Tasty On Pizza.

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,650
Does It Repel You?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,760
It Repels My Dates Sometimes.

15
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,610
Toss Holy Water On Me, I Get Wet.

16
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,390
Crucifixes? Okay, If You Like
That Kind Of Thing.

17
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,240
Oh, And I Definitely
Can't Turn Into A Bat.

18
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,370
That'd Be Cool, Though,
Wouldn't It?

19
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,630
What About Daylight?

20
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,520
Daylight's Not Good.
Daylight's Not Good.

21
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,340
The Longer I'm In The Sun,
The Worse I Feel.

22
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,160
- But You Don't Burst Into Flames?
- Not If I Can Help It.

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,810
How Do You Kill A Vampire?
Wooden Stake, I'm Guessing?

24
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,930
No, A Wooden Stake
Won't Kill A Vampire

25
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,660
Flamethrower
Will Kill A Vampire.

26
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,030
Or We Can Lose Our Head.
I Mean, Literally.

27
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,940
Other Than That, We Heal.

28
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,920
You Seem Like A Very Nice Guy,
But Don't Vampires Kill People?

29
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,910
Most Vampires Don't Have
Boundaries Or Rules, But I Do.

30
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,690
I Don't Hunt Women.
I Don't Hunt Children.

31
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,570
I Don't Hunt Innocents,But There's Predators Out There 
Who Need To Be Dealt With.

32
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,930
Is That Why You Became
A Private Investigator?

33
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,570
It's A Way To Use My Special Abilities.

34
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,340
- Any Advice For The Vampire Wannabes Out There?
- Yeah...

35
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,730
Stay Out Of My Way.

36
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,700
I Often Wondered What It Would Be Like
If I Had The Opportunity To Explain Myself...

37
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,270
But That's Just A Fantasy.

38
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,270
Here's The Reality.

39
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,300
You Sleep Alone...

40
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,770
You Keep Your Secrets Hidden.

41
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,570
Oh, Yeah, And Here's What
A Dinner Party Looks Like.

42
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,740
I Know, I Know.

43
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,010
Everyone Says They're Open-minded.

44
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,920
Everyone Tries To Accept People
Who Are Different From Them.

45
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,640
But The Truth Is People Don't React Well 
When They Find Out That You're...

46
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,930
Undead.

47
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,820
And The Other Thing
You've Got To Deal With--

48
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,610
When You Live Forever,

49
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,030
The Past Always Catches Up With You.

50
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,080
Like All Good Detective Stories,This One Starts With A Girl...

51
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,780
A Promising Life Cut Tragically Short.

52
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,080
Tonight, A Killer Is On The Loose.

53
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,560
Well, Technically Two Girls,

54
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,910
And One Of Them's Already Dead.

55
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,020
This Is Beth Turner For "Buzzwire." Cut.

56
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,790
Really? I Was Okay?

57
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,780
Oh, Yeah, Total Amanpour.I Mean, No One Would 
Ever Know It Was Your Very First Live Webcast.

58
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,590
- We Gotta Get A Shot Of The Body.
- Cops Won't Let Anyone Get Close.

59
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,730
I'm Not Leaving Without My Money Shot.

60
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,750
- Oh, My God.Did I Just Say That?
- Yes.

61
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,520
- I've Become A News Whore Overnight.
- Not... Overnight.

62
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,400
Lieutenant Carl!

63
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,750
Carl, What Can You Tell Me?

64
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,160
- Well, Let's See, Beth.
- Nothing.

65
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,780
Come On.I Was First On Scene.

66
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,800
Who Fed You The Location On 
The 710 Freeway Shooter?

67
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,540
All Right, Fine.

68
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,500
We Think She Was A Hearst College Student.

69
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,170
She Had Their Mascot Tattooed On A 
Very Discreet Part Of Her Anatomy.

70
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,080
- Front Or Back? 
- These Guys--get These Cameras Out Of Here!

71
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,850
Get These Cameras Out Of Here,
Now! Move It!

72
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,610
When You've Been Around
As Long As I Have,

73
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,960
You Ink That Nothing
Can Surprise You Anymore,

74
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,890
But That Was Before Tonight--

75
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,060
Before I Saw Her

76
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,050
Walking Barefoot Through A Freezing 
Fountain At 2:00 In The Morning.

77
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:55,780
Beth...

78
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,120
Step Away From The Body.

79
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,470
"Murder On Melrose." No.

80
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,540
"Southland Student Slain."

81
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,170
Vampire.
Something With "Vampire" In It.

82
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,830
Do I Know You?

83
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,650
You Tell Me.

84
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,550
You're A Cop, Right?

85
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,180
No.

86
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,610
Reporter.

87
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,630
Nope.

88
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,930
We've Met Before.
You Look Very Familiar.

89
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,040
Well, Maybe I've Just Got
One Of Those Faces.

90
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,720
Okay.

91
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,790
Question.
What Do You Like Better--

92
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,680
"Vampire Slaying Rocks L.A."--

93
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,310
There's No Such Thing As Vampires.

94
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,960
I Don't Think The Girl
In The Fountain Would Agree.

95
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,580
I Mean--

96
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,080
Come On, Beth.The Body's Gone.
Cops Packed Up Hours Ago, Okay?

97
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,670
What Are We Still Doing Here?

98
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,810
Oking For The Girl's Car.

99
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,820
Right, And How Do We Know
She Didn't Walk?

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,090
- Nobody Walks In L.A.
- Of Course.

101
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,550
Here We Go.

102
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,290
Hearst College Parking Permit.

103
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,190
I Need You To Check On That Parking Decal.

104
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,940
- I Can't Deal Right Now.
- No, Don't Worry About It.I'll Call 'em, I'll Call 'em.

105
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:01,240
200,000 Unique Visitors On Your Vampire Story,
And We Posted Less Than 24 Hours Ago.

106
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,060
The Vampire Angle Was Genius.
Did You Come Up With That?

107
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,540
Yeah, It Just Kinda Came To Me.

108
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,690
Very Nice. Get Me Some
Science On This--an Expert.

109
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,190
Now I Wanna Blow This Thing Up,
Make It Seem Real.

110
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,160
"Are There Vampires Among Us?"
I'm Letting You Run With This.

111
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,130
What's Your Next Move?

112
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,020
Steve Got The Dead Girl's
Address From A Parking Permit.

113
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,330
I Think I'll Take
A Look Around.

114
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,400
Don't Think. Go.
Mama Needs Fresh Content.

115
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,540
You Don't Get To Change The Rules Of The Game
After The Game Has Started,

116
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,880
And That Goes For Your Silent
South American Partners, Too.

117
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,900
My Position Is Simple, Okay?

118
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,740
I'm Short The Shanghai A-shares,And 
That Was A Guaranteed Deal.

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,890
Guaranteed!

120
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,510
Hey, Buddy, Let Me Get Rid Of This Guy.

121
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,900
My Friend Josef Is One Of The Oldest Vampires In L.A.--

122
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,090
400, Going On 30. Living...

123
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,520
Well Unliving Prooves That Paranoea Never Goes Out Of Style

124
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,290
Any Default, And I Would Not Be Sleeping So Snugly If I Were You.

125
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,670
These People Are
Unbelievable--no Integrity.

126
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,030
Oh,You Don't Like Veiled Threats?

127
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,240
Then How About This? You Screw Me, And 
Personally Come Down There And Cut Heart Out, Okay?

128
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,960
That's The Only Thing They Understand.

129
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,220
Oh, That Sounds Good.

130
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,860
And My Best To The Family.

131
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,480
Ah, You Look Good. You
Working Out? Little Bit, Huh?

132
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,900
Well, Have You Seen The News?

133
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,810
This Terrible Thing In West Hollywood?

134
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,070
- It's Everywhere."Vampire Slaying Rocks L.A."
- Yeah, I Know.It Doesn't Look Good For Us.

135
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,940
It's A Threat To Our Secrecy.
What Is This, The 1720s?

136
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,260
We're Discreet. We Don't
Leave Bodies Lying Around.

137
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,010
Now We Have To Be Extra Vigilant.
We Live In An Age Of Fingerprint Scans,

138
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,750
- D.N.A. Tests, Genome Mapping--
- Josef, Relax, Okay?


139
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,940
I Am Relaxed. This Is Relaxed.

140
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,710
You're Only 90. You've Never Been Chased 
By A Torch-bearing Mob--hungry!

141
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,710
- Would You Care For A Liquid Refreshment?
- No, Thank You.

142
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,840
Are You Sure?She's Delicious.

143
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,020
'82 Was A Good Year.

144
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,230
Oh, We Went To The Super Bowl In '82, Right?

145
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,730
Lost A Million Bucks On Cincinnati That Year, Right?

146
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,950
- Except For That.
- Yeah.

147
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,490
You're Fooling Yourself

148
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,630
- If You Think You Can Exist On That Retail Blood Forever.
- I Do All Right.

149
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,750
Yeah, For Now. But You're
Fighting A Losing Battle,My Friend

150
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,490
Okay?Sooner Or Later,Your Inner Vampire 
Is Going To Demand To Be Fed,

151
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,100
And Then What?

152
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,680
- Good-bye, Josef.
- Good-bye.

153
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,660
My Guy At The Morgue,Guillermo,

154
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,020
Deals In Information And Blood.

155
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,490
Tonight I Needed Both.

156
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,450
Hey, Mick.What Can I Do You For?

157
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,420
Drinking On The Job?

158
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,390
40 Or 6-pack?

159
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,610
Give Me A Sixer.

160
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh-ho.Thirsty Boy, Huh?

161
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,940
I Don't Know Why You Like
This A-positive So Much.

162
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,930
The O-positive Has Got A Much Better Finish.

163
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,680
I Wanna See The Body Of The Girl
They Found At The Design Center.

164
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,980
Yeah,I Figured You Would.

165
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,560
There's No Smell Of Vampire On Her.

166
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,270
- I Noticed. The Carotid Artery's Been Severed.
- How Much Blood Loss?

167
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,480
She Exsanguinated At 40% Loss, The Heart Stops.

168
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,860
Vampire Would've Drained Her.

169
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,180
Those Aren't Bite Marks.

170
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:24,980
They're Too Clean.

171
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,600
Plus There's Impact Trauma Around The Wound,

172
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,460
And Her Neck Was Punctured By Something.

173
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,120
Call Me If You Get Anything Else.

174
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,120
Oh, Yeah, Yeah,'cause I Work For You, Right?

175
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,980
I Didn't Intend To End Up A Do-gooder.

176
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,510
For The Longest Time,I Was Like Most People--

177
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,760
Just Kind Of Looking Out For Myself.

178
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,300
Then 22 Years Ago,

179
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,080
I Took A Case That Changed My Life Forever.

180
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,430
Los  Angeles 1985

181
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,190
Mr. St. John,Please Help Me.
Someone Took My Daughter.

182
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,110
Some Cases Really Sucker Punch You.

183
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,620
You Think You Know What You're Getting Into, Then... Wham.

184
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,620
The Police Have Nothing.It's Been Two Days.

185
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,580
Whether It's A Missing Child Or A Murdered Coed,

186
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,450
Victims Always Leave A Trail.

187
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,570
You Just Have To Find It.

188
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Cops Had Been At The Dead Girl's 
Apartment Since Morning.

189
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,180
I'd Been Waiting Since 6:00.

190
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,100
Looks Like I Wasn't The Only One.

191
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,240
- You Were At The Crime Scene.
- Easy With The Mace, Okay?

192
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,390
- Stay Back!
- I'm Not Gonna Hurt You.

193
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,640
You're Not Gonna Hurt Me?

194
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,100
How Do I Know You're Not The Killer?

195
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,120
Well, Because I'm Not Killing You.

196
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,040
Okay. If You're Not The Killer--

197
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,520
And Let's Go With That,'cause That's Comforting--

198
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,130
What Are You Doing Here?

199
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,960
I'm A Private Investigator.

200
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,780
Let Me See Your Credentials.

201
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,440
"Mick St. John"?

202
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,490
Who Are You Working For?

203
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,320
Falls Under My Client Confidentiality Agreement.

204
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,700
So Don't You Wanna Know Who I Am 
And What I'm Doing Here?

205
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,360
You're Beth Turner.You Work For "Buzzwire."

206
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,980
It's Entertaining.

207
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,070
Excuse Me.It's Not Just Entertainment.

208
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,420
It's Hard-hitting,Investigative--

209
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,260
- Okay, There's A Bit Of Sleaze.
- You're Probably The Best.

210
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:22,900
Best What?

211
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,960
Thing They Have.

212
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,980
Oh. Thanks.

213
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,970
Let Me See.

214
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,730
I Saw Something Just Like It
In The Victim's Car.

215
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,680
- Look. Same Exact Thing.I've Been Researching It--
- Egyptian Hieroglyphic.

216
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,660
The Insignia For An Ancient Blood Cult.

217
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,800
Right. Blood Cult.

218
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,560
So We're Talking Vampires?

219
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,880
I Know.They Don't Exist.

220
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,470
Something Has To Explain All The Killing 
And The Goth-o-rama Around Here.I Mean...

221
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,770
Obviously,She Had A Thing For Vampires.

222
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,980
Yeah, I Guess They're Back In Style.

223
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,690
You Know, Some People Actually Find Them Attractive.

224
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:08,450
Really?

225
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,340
Yeah.

226
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,390
- What Is It?
- Blood.

227
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,730
We Should Get That To The Police.

228
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,190
Hey, Honey.

229
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,660
Josh, I'm In The Middle Of Something Right Now.
Can I Call You Back?Okay. Bye.

230
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,390
Stop Doing That.

231
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,290
Nine Out Of Ten Murders,

232
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,270
The Killer Is Someone The Victim Knew.

233
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,800
That's Why I Wasn't About
To Miss Kelly Foster's Funeral.

234
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,030
Too Bad Funerals Always
Take Place During The Day.

235
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,160
That Glance In The Grave
Always Puts Everyone On Edge,

236
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,730
But When It's Murder...

237
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,140
Keep Your Eyes Open.

238
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,470
You're Gonna See More
Than Just Tears.

239
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,000
Thanks For Ditching Me
The Other Night.

240
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,680
I Knew You'd Be All Right.
You're Resourceful.

241
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,490
Kelly Was A Bright
And Promising Student,

242
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,350
And We All Mourn Her Loss.

243
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,530
Christian Ellis--

244
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,240
He Was Kelly's
Social Anthropology Professor.

245
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,440
We Inhabit Our Physical Bodies
For What We Call A Lifetime,

246
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,290
But Death Holds No Dominion.

247
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,940
Kelly Foster Lives
As Our Sister In Blood.

248
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,350
I'm Guessing The Emos With The Black Roses
Are Part Of His Ancient Mythology Studies Program.

249
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,770
- Did Your Homework.
- Which I Am Sharing With You.

250
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,640
Your Turn.Where's The Blood Vial?

251
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,170
You Took A Vial Of Blood From Kelly's Apartment.

252
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,420
I Want It.

253
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,490
You Son Of A Bitch!

254
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,790
Chloe, Chloe!
Chloe, Chloe, Chloe!

255
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,980
Chloe, Chloe, Hey, Hey,
We Still Love You.

256
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,530
- Oh, Shut Up!
- You Know That.

257
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,260
A Whiff Of Fresh Blood On The Air

258
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,900
Blood I'd Smelled Before.

259
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,680
You Okay?

260
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,670
I'm Okay.

261
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,310
Lot Of Angry People.
Angry People Make Good Suspects.

262
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,360
And Dangerous Ones.

263
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,140
Don't Worry.
I'll Look Out For You.

264
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,360
We Should Divvy Them Up.
Two Can Cover More Ground.

265
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,190
I Work Alone.

266
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,040
A Girl's Dead.
I'm Not Letting This Go.

267
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,770
Kind Of Pushy, Aren't You?

268
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,330
You'll Get Used To It.

269
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,140
Start With The Professor.

270
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,540
I'll Take His Young Attacker.

271
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,050
Wait. What About My Vial?

272
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,760
We Should Get It To The Police So They Can 
Analyze It,Find Out Whose Blood It Is.

273
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,960
It's The Professor's.

274
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,600
What's Going On With You
And Professor Ellis, Chloe?

275
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,500
What Do You Mean?

276
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,700
Well, You Tried Slicing The Guy
Open At The Funeral Today.

277
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,560
Christian's A Svengali.

278
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,330
He, Like, Brainwashed Kelly
With All This Literary Crap

279
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:32,770
About Vampires And Sex And Dark Desires.

280
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,580
He Runs A Vampire Study Group.

281
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,560
Study Group?

282
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,790
It's A Cult.

283
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,010
What Goes On There?

284
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,430
The Usual Clich?--chanting,
Candles, Blood Drinking.

285
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,870
They Drink Blood?

286
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,410
Oh, Yeah. Christian Thinks
He's A Vampire.

287
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,220
A Real Vampire?

288
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,930
A Lot Of Girls Believe Him.

289
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,110
He's Got A Lot Of...Disciples.

290
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,780
- Were You A Disciple?
- Yeah, I Was In.

291
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,150
In Fact, I Was The One
Who Told Kelly She Should Join.

292
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,640
Big Mistake That Was.

293
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,740
What Happened?

294
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,040
She Was All Over Christian,

295
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,620
Totally Fed Into His Crap.

296
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,430
And You Didn't?

297
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,810
Yeah, I Did.

298
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,960
He's Really Powerful...

299
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,120
Seductive...

300
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,650
- Makes You Feel Special.
- But You Weren't.

301
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,060
No.

302
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,340
And That Made You Jealous Of Kelly?

303
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,720
Yeah, And Pissed Off.

304
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,840
And, No,I Didn't Kill Her,

305
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,510
If That's What
You Want To Know.

306
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,530
Go Write Your Stupid Little
Vampire Story Someplace Else.

307
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,430
When I Was Turned Into A Vampire,

308
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,620
All My Senses Were Heightened To 11.

309
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,560
For God Sakes,
You're Giving Me A Headache.

310
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,460
I'm Able To Smell The Past...

311
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,180
Glimpse The Future...

312
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,740
- Not Now. I Have Class.
- Oh, When Should We Discuss This--

313
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,350
When Another One Of
Your Students Turns Up Dead?

314
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,380
And I Can Hear A Marriage Going Down The 
Drain From A Hundred Yards.

315
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,510
I Had Nothing To Do With That.

316
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,060
Is That What
We're Telling People?

317
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,380
You Tell Them Whatever
The Hellou Want.

318
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,810
Hi. Is Professor Ellis Home,Please?

319
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,010
He's Not Here.

320
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,600
Oh. Uh, I'm--
I'm Sorry To Disturb You.

321
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,750
I Didn't Mean To Bother.

322
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,990
Is There Something That
I Can Help You With, Mister...

323
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,990
St. John. Mick St. John.
I'm A Private Investigator.

324
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,970
This Is About The Dead Girl.

325
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,970
Yes, I-i'm Looking Into The Case.

326
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,860
This Must Be Very Difficult For You.

327
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,050
How About I-i Come Back Another Time?

328
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,750
What Do You Want To Know?

329
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:09,310
There Was A Time When Christian
Was A Serious Academic.

330
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,080
He Has A Phd
In Mythological Anthropology.

331
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,320
He Published Every Year.

332
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,740
But Now He Has Other Interests.

333
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,230
Like Kelly Foster?

334
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,650
Among Others.

335
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,090
These Girls Are So Young
And Impressionable.

336
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,020
- I Used To Be That Way Myself.
- Me, Too.

337
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,470
Christian Can Be
Very Charming... Like A Snake.

338
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,430
Oh, He's A Vampire By The Way.

339
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,690
- I Don't Know If You Knew That.
- I Did Not.

340
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,880
At Least, That's What He Tells
Them When He Seduces Them

341
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,450
In The Basement
Of Chandler Hall.

342
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,590
Mrs. Ellis, Do You Think Your 
Husband Killed Kelly Foster?

343
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,300
The Girl Had A Bite In Her Neck, Right?

344
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,660
- Right.
- He's The Only Vampire I Know.

345
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,680
We Have All Fed On Blood,

346
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,790
Every One Of You In This Room.

347
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,990
Everyone On This Earth...

348
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,510
In The Womb,

349
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,920
Our First Meal Is Blood.

350
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,810
We Feed In Darkness.
There Is No Time.

351
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,040
There's No Life.
There's No Death.

352
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,840
It Is A Perfect World,

353
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,540
Seemingly Everlasting,

354
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:29,900
Until We Are Ripped
From The Womb Into Daylight.

355
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,620
When We Are Born,
That Paradise Is Lost,

356
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,520
And We Spend The Rest
Of Our Days

357
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,670
Trying To Find Our Way Back--

358
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,060
Back To That Perfect World
Of Blood And Darkness.

359
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,500
That's Enough For Tonight.

360
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,410
But Remember To Take
This Truth With You

361
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,040
To Your Everyday Lives.

362
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,250
We Are All Vampires,
Every Last One Of Us.

363
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,550
I Will See You All Next Week.

364
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,520
That Was
An Amazing Lecture.

365
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,540
Thank You.
Hey, I'm Kate Nelson.

366
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,390
I Just Transferred Down
From Berkeley.

367
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,630
Welcome.

368
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,720
I Read Your Book,
"The Mythology Of Darkness."

369
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,450
Well, That's More Than I Can
Say For A Lot Of My Students.

370
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,330
I Think
It's Really Interesting,

371
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,760
The Vampire As Metaphor
For Desire.

372
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,300
The Thirst For Blood Is
Symbolic Of A Deeper Hunger.

373
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,530
A Hunger To Connect.

374
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,740
You Did Read My Book, Huh?

375
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,720
Do You Think I Could
Audit Your Class?

376
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,750
Well, My Lectures
Are Pretty Popular,

377
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,020
But I'm Sure We Could
Squeeze You In.

378
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,550
Thanks.
I Really Appreciate It.

379
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,580
Sure.
I Know I'm A Month Behind.

380
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,010
Is There A Syllabus
I Could Get Started On

381
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,440
Or Some Way To Catch Me Up?

382
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,170
Well, I Do Have A Study Group

383
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,010
For Some Of My More
Motivated Students.

384
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,720
I'm Really Motivated.

385
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,550
Daniel?

386
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,850
This Is Daniel, My T.A.

387
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,400
Daniel, This Is Kate...

388
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,220
Nelson.

389
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,360
Kate Nelson. I'm Sorry.

390
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,620
Would You Take Down
Her Information?
Sure.

391
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,240
I Have To Get Going.

392
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,300
Hi. Study Group, Huh?

393
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,990
Sounds Intriguing.

394
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,690
-so How Do We Get Hold Of You?
-3-1-0...

395
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,990
Somewhere In The City,
A Killer Is On The Loose.

396
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,870
Josef Wants Me To Hunt Him
To Keep Our Secret Safe.

397
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,120
I Just Want To Make Sure
He Doesn't Do It Again.

398
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,390
You Don't Have To Be A Vampire
To Get A Taste For Blood.

399
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,200
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
You Startled Me.

400
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,510
I'm Mick St. John.

401
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,190
Right. My Wife Mentioned
You Came By The House.

402
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,240
You're Looking
Into Kelly Foster's Death.

403
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,770
Uh, Murder.

404
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,960
Do You Mind If I Ask
Who You're Working For?

405
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,290
I'm Working For Kelly.

406
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,500
Well, Then I Want To Help
In Any Way I Can.

407
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,930
She Was
An Extraordinary Girl,

408
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,900
On
And I...
I Truly Cared For Her.

409
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,670
So There Was
A Relationship?

410
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,420
I Already Told
The Police Everything.

411
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,850
I Have Nothing To Hide.

412
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,670
If I Did, Do You Think
I'd Be Talking To You?

413
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,070
That Piece Is
Over 500 Years Old,

414
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,310
From The Reign
Of Sigismund I--

415
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,950
The Sign Of Vilnius,
A Lithuanian Vampire God.

416
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,570
Vampire God, Huh?

417
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,930
You Know, That's Interesting,
Because Kelly Foster

418
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,100
Showed Up Dead With
Two Bite Marks In Her Neck.

419
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,710
Well, Clearly, Someone's Trying To Make It Look

420
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,180
?????????

421
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,520
?????????

422
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,150
-i Am A Vampire. 
-really?

423
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:57,870
Well, Not In The Way

424
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,740
Most Commonly Portrayed
In Dime-store Novels.

425
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,580
When Most People Hear
The Word "Vampire,"

426
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,270
They Immediately
Conjure Up An Image

427
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,750
Of Some Undead Monstrosity
Running Around At Night

428
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,550
Trying To Drink Human Blood.

429
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,250
Hate That.

430
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,070
A Real Vampire Is Simply
A Person Born With The Abili

431
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,030
To Absorb And Manipulate
Pranic Energy.

432
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,730
-"Prana" Is A Hindi Word Meaning--
-life Force.

433
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,540
Yes, Very Good.

434
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,900
Real Vampires Have
A Critical Eneicy Imbalance.

435
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,540
So We Must Seek Out
Pranic Energy And Absorb It.

436
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,820
Couldn't You Just Have
A Double Espresso Or Something?

437
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,310
Fresh Blood Has Oovery High
Pranic Energy Content,

438
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,470
Hence The Blood Link
To Vampires.

439
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,740
But When Done Correctly,
A Pranic Ceremony

440
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,330
Can Have Salutary Effects
For Both Participants.

441
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,110
So Tell Me Something,
Professor--

442
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,730
Do The Salutary Effects
Kick In

443
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,560
Befo Or After The Sex
With Your Students?

444
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,110
I Think
We're Through Talking.

445
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,760
All Right, Thank You.
You Know, If One
Of The Killers You Put Away

446
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,710
Ever Wanted To Get Even,
All They Would Have To Do

447
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,900
Is Wait For The Cochinita Pibil
To Go On Special.

448
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,450
"Vampire Slaying Rocks L.A."?

449
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,280
Publicity Spawns Tips, Carl.

450
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,450
Yeah, And Copycats.
Don't Be Mad. I Gave You
The Vial Of Blood.

451
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,830
It's Inadmissible.

452
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,920
Did You Have It Analyzed? Is It
From A Person Of Interest?

453
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,700
The Professor Of Darkness?

454
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,940
You Have His D.N.A.
On File?

455
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,830
- Look, He Volunteered A D.N.A.
Swab During His First Interview.
- Cooperative.

456
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,670
Yeah, That's What They
Always Want You To Think.

457
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,270
What Do You Have On Chloe Jones?

458
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:27,750
????

459
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,240
????
???

460
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,090
She Should Be.

461
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:31,330
We Found A Stalking
And Harassment Complaint

462
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,730
- Filed Against Her
With The Campus Police.
- Filed By?

463
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:37,030
- Kelly Foster.
- Chloe Said They Were
Best Friends.

464
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,890
They Were. We Also Found A Blood Pendant At Chloe's 
Apartment.

465
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,000
They Were Both Sleeping With The Professor.

466
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,660
Well, Threesomes
Never End Well.
Huh?

467
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,840
Don't Ask.

468
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,520
It's About Time You Got Back.

469
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,020
Make Yourself At Home.

470
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,450
I Did,
And Poured Myself A Drink.

471
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,750
You Seriously
Drink This Stuff?

472
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,400
- What Is It, Like,
Nonfat Soy Vegan Blood?
- If You Don't Like It--

473
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,780
- I Didn't Say That.
- Are You Sure?

474
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,960
Get Out Of Here. Actually,
You Got Any Freshies Around?

475
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,390
Yeah, Of Course Not.

476
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,760
Am I Supposed To Know
Why You're Here, Josef?

477
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,570
It Is Possible
That There Is A Core Truth

478
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,130
Behind The Vampire Myth.

479
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:27,010
Perhaps There Are People With
Certain Genetic Predispositions

480
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:31,160
Who Actually Could Require
And Digest Blood.

481
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,200
Vampire Experts. Beautiful.

482
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,420
Now We Got The Food
Mouthing Off About The Farmer.

483
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,490
The Whole City Is Talking.

484
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:41,450
- You Want To Know What
They're Talking About? Us.
- So It's A Slow News Day.

485
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,580
Oh, That's Not It.

486
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,390
It's A Reporter From "Buzzwire."

487
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,140
She Started This Whole
Killer Vampire Thing--

488
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,360
- A Beth Somebody.
- Turner.

489
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,900
You Know Her?

490
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,020
Yeah, We Did Some Breaking
And Entering Together.

491
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,320
Hmm. Well, You, My Friend,
Must Get Her To Stop.

492
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,450
What Do You Mean?

493
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,840
Like She's Driving Along
And Suddenly Her Car Explodes?

494
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,480
I Was Thinking You'd Ask Her Nicely,

495
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,480
- But Fielder's Choice.
The Killer's
- Not A Vampire, Josef.

496
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,680
- There Were Bite Marks.
- Two Stab Wounds.

497
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,380
- And The Blood?
- Well, You Hit An Artery, You're
Bound To Get Some Of That.

498
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,200
Oh, So You're Telling Me
Some Possoannabe

499
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,100
Drinking Blood Out
Of A Snoop Dogg Chalice

500
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,630
- Is Behind This?
- Yeah, Something Like That.

501
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,830
- Why Haven't You Killed Him?
- There's More Than One Suspect.

502
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,310
So Kill Them All.
That's What I Would Do.

503
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,940
Hey, Look, I Know You Have
Morals And Scruples,

504
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,500
And That's Fine... Sort Of.

505
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,470
But You Are Not The Man I
On Occasion Pretend To Respect

506
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,300
If You Don't Get This
Under Control.

507
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,820
Hey, You Have A Soft Spot
For The Mortal Ones,

508
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,680
A Fascination With All
The Charming

509
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,640
While Listening
To The Tick, Tick, Tick

510
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,500
Of Their Own Looming Demise.
That's Fine. It's Good.

511
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,150
Everyone Needs A Hobby.

512
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,660
Look, People Aren't Gonna
Suddenly Believe In Vampires

513
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,400
- Because Of A "Buzzwire" Article.
- Are You Willing To Take That Risk?

514
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,420
If Everyone Have Vampires
On Their Mind

515
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,040
Because Of Some Reporter,
Suddenly Things Get Noticed.

516
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:55,300
- We Get Noticed.
- I Said I'm On This.

517
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,520
Good, 'cause If That Reporter
Actually Finds Out

518
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,160
Who We Are, She Gets A Pulitzer,
And We Join The List

519
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,780
Of Extinct Species.
We're On The Same Side.

520
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,140
I'm Sorry. I'm Not
Questioning Your Loyalties.

521
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,650
Yeah? Good.

522
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,460
Yeah. Vampire Solidarity.
Rah, Rah, Rah And All That.

523
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,960
Hey, And Don't Forget,

524
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,400
I'm Your Only Friend Who Doesn't
Like You Just For Your Money.

525
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,860
That's True. Sad But True.

526
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,690
We're Closed.

527
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,650
Oh. It's You.
It's Not Funny.

528
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,010
Why Are You Wearing
That Stupid Thing Anyway?

529
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,520
Take It Off. You're Really
Starting To Freak Me Out.

530
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,460
Did You Hear Me?

531
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,780
Relationships Are Complicated.

532
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,870
Vampire Or Mortal--

533
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,810
That's One Thing
We Have In Common.

534
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,540
Yeah, Yeah.

535
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,150
Okay, Here's What
I Don't Understand.

536
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,410
I'm Fine. How Are You?

537
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,400
How Did You Know The Blood

538
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,230
We Found In The Vial Was The Professor's?

539
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,410
You're Saying It Wasn't?
No, It Was.

540
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,400
He Gave The Police
A D.N.A. Sample, And It Matched.

541
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,450
So You Must Have A Source
In The Department, Right?

542
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:32,230
No, But Obviously You Do.

543
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,470
So...

544
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,700
What Did You Find Out
About Chloe?

545
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,070
She's Got A Few
Anger Management Issues.

546
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,560
Turns Out Our Murder Victim
Got A Restraining Order

547
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,310
Against Her
A Couple Months Ago.

548
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,190
What's Her Deal?
The Professor Toss Her Aside?

549
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,040
Yeah, But Murder?

550
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,200
Check Her Out.

551
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,750
Let Me Kw What You Think.

552
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:58,970
Okay.

553
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,280
What About The Wife?

554
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,240
Well, She Knows
Her Husband's A Snake.

555
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,480
- But The Professor...
- What?

556
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:11,070
- He Thinks He's A Vampire.
- Yeah, I Know. I Attended
His So-called Class.

557
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:11,590
You What?

558
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,950
I Also Managed To Wrangle
An Invite To His Study Group.

559
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,290
I'm Not Sure
That's A Good Idea.

560
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,960
What Are They Gonna Do, Kill
A Newcomer To Get Extra Credit?

561
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,600
I Just Think
You Should Be Careful.

562
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,670
- Don't Let The Professor
Get You Alone.
- I'll Be Careful.

563
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,560
Good.

564
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,480
You Look So Familiar.

565
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,800
Are You Sure
We Haven't Met Before?

566
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,610
Yeah, Twice Now.

567
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,180
No, Someplace Else.

568
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,540
I-i Guess I've Just Got--

569
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,440
One Of Those Faces.
I Know, You Said.

570
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,190
I Should Go.

571
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,940
Sometimes The Past Doesn't
Just Catch Up With You.

572
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,090
It Haunts You...

573
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,610
Makes You Think
About Your Choices.

574
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,990
On That Night 22 Years Ago...
It's All Right.

575
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:24,600
I Followed A Trail...
I'm Here. It's All Right.

576
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,510
Found The Girl
And Came Face-to-face

577
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,080
With The Woman
Who'd Made Me A Monster--

578
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,760
Coraline.

579
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,300
I Knew You Would Come.

580
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,970
Here We Are, Mick...

581
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,850
Finally One Happy Family.

582
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:53,770
Forever Is A Long Time
With An Ex-wife Like Mine.

583
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,870
You're Taking A Long Time
Putting That Mike On.

584
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,100
I'm Just Trying To Get It
Exactly Right Here.

585
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,580
Does That Include
Feeling Me Up?

586
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,790
Hey, You're Going Into
The Vampire's Lair, Okay?

587
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,300
I Just Want To Make Sure
This Mike Works.

588
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,660
I'll Be Fine.

589
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,950
So... Exclusive Infiltration
Of A College Sex And Blood Cult.

590
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,980
Man, The Story Just
Keeps Getting Better.

591
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,920
A Girl's Dead.
This Is An Important Story.

592
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,920
Yeah, It Doesn't Mean
We Can't Milk It.

593
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,050
?????

594
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,580
||
Chloe?

595
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,220
Chloe?

596
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,340
Chloe?

597
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,080
Beth.

598
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,610
Hm
Where Are We Going,
Exactly?

599
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,770
Don't Worry.
It's All Part Of The Ritual.

600
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,980
Ritual? I Thought
It Was A Study Group.

601
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,300
Yeah. You'll See.

602
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,290
Seriously?
The Ritual's In A Boiler Room?

603
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,030
Hi. You've Reached Beth Turner.

604
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,730
I'm Unable To Answer Your Call
Your Call Right Now,

605
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,640
So Please Leave A Message,
And I'll Get Back To You?????

606
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,580
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

607
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,410
Lurks Between The Lines
Of Sanskrit Tablets.

608
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,400
Numerous Cultures Of Antiquity
Believed That Blood

609
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,780
Was The Vital Element

610
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,890
In The Lovemaking
And Life-giving Process.

611
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:08,510
Now All These Ancient Texts
Can Be Categorized

612
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:11,910
In A Number Of Ways,
But What's Most Important To Us

613
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:15,270
Is The Spirit Of These Texts,
Not The Letter.

614
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,640
Hi, Kate.

615
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,260
So The Ancient Tantric Practice
Of Using Sexual Intercourse

616
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,110
To Transform One's Sexual Energy

617
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:29,680
Intolissful Consciousness
Speaks To That Issue Perfectly.

618
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,810
Well, I Think That's Enough
For Tonight.

619
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,550
I Will See You All Next Week.

620
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,290
Blood Is Life, And Life Is Blood.

621
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:44,100
Born Into Light,
We Seek The Dark.

622
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,120
Thank You.

623
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,520
Kate.

624
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,430
I'm So Glad You Could Make It.
Seems Like I Missed It.

625
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,870
I Thought I Was Supposed
To Be Here At 11:00.

626
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,420
Well, This Is Your First Session,

627
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,130
And I Like To Get

628
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,960
- A Little One-on-one Time
With My Students.
- Okay.

629
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,990
So Let's Go Back And Talk.

630
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,220
Don't Be Shy.

631
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,400
Hold Out Your Hands
Above Mine.

632
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,240
Right Above Mine.

633
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,330
Just Like That.

634
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,800
We Are Only Now Rediscovering
What The Ancients Knew.

635
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:36,820
We Are Simply Energy.
We Both Radiate And Absorb It.

636
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,860
Concentrate On Your Hands.

637
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,330
Do You Feel That?

638
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,740
Uh... Maybe.

639
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,510
It Takes A Little Practice.

640
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,620
Close Your Eyes...

641
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,640
And Concentrate.

642
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,430
Feel Your Yonic Energy
Balancing Mine.

643
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,980
Do This Long Enough...

644
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,940
Our Hearts Will Synchronize.

645
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,520
Are You Kidding Me?
This Actually Works For You?

646
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,330
What Do You Have
Under There?

647
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,240
Huh?

648
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,060
What Do You Have
Under There?

649
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,550
Get Your Hands Off Me.
Get Off!

650
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,300
Are You Recording This?

651
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,150
Who Are You? Answer Me!

652
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,480
Where's The Recorder?

653
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,010
Kate! Hey, Kate!
You All Right? What Happened?

654
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,660
I Need To Call The Police!
Why? What Did He Do To You?

655
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,500
Do You Have A Cell Phone?
Uh, Uh, Yeah, In My Car.
Come On.

656
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,750
Where Is She?
Who?

657
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,560
Your New Student.
Where Is She?

658
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:18,060
No Idea.
What Do You Think--

659
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,380
I Don't Have A Lot Of Time.

660
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,650
I Know She Was Here, Man.

661
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,690
I Can Smell Her On You.

662
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,300
And You're Gonna Tell Me
Where She Is.

663
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,820
She Just Left.

664
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,510
But... You Can't Be Real.

665
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:41,830
That's Right, Professor,

666
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,470
Because There's No Such Thing
As Vampires.

667
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,490
Li
Why Are You Doing This?

668
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,830
You Wouldn't Understand.

669
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,280
I Might.
Christian's A Prophet.

670
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,980
His Teachings
Reveal The Powerful Truth

671
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,540
About Our Vital Pranic Energy.

672
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,790
We Must Absorb This Energy,
Preserve It,

673
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,470
Not Waste It On Women.

674
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,350
Without These Distractions,

675
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:17,220
- Christian Can Fulfill
His True Destiny.
- What Destiny?

676
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:17,980
Hey, Hey!

677
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,240
?????

678
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,030
Shouldn't Have Done That.

679
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,350
Everything's Gonna
Be All Right.

680
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,110
You're Not Gonna Do This.

681
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:01,010
It'll Work, Mick,
You, Me And Baby.

682
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:04,280
No. I'm Not Gonna Let You
Hurt That Girl.

683
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,990
I Can't Let You.

684
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,850
Come On.

685
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,460
I'm Gonna Take You Home.

686
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,010
The Last Time I Held Her In
My Arms, She Was Only A Child.

687
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,680
Over The Years,
I Tried To Stay Close,

688
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,990
Just Out Of Sight,
In Case She Needed Me.

689
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,110
And Tonight She Did.

690
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,390
It's All Right.

691
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,610
You're With Me.

692
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,980
You Saved Me.

693
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,880
From A Graduate Student
In Mythological Studies.

694
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,250
Didn't Exactly Take Superman.
No, That's Not What I Meant.

695
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,180
I Mean, When I Was Little.

696
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,610
When I Was Taken.

697
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,700
You Got A Really Nasty Bump
On Your Head Tonight.

698
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,960
You Probably Just Need To-

699
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,240
He Stabbed You.

700
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,720
He Sure Tried.

701
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,960
I Saw The Knife Come Out.
He...

702
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:34,520
You Need To Get Some Rest.

703
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,430
I'm Gonna Take You Home,
Okay?

704
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,430
60 Years Is A Long Time

705
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,940
To Deny Yourself
The Touch Of Another...

706
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:51,170
||
But You Do It Because You
Just Can't Bear The Thought

707
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,410
Of Seeing Yourself As A Monster
In Someone Else's Es.
