1
00:02:38,594 --> 00:02:40,353
Lucy, calm down.

2
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:42,950
Lucy, calm down.

3
00:02:43,618 --> 00:02:46,164
I... I see something horrible happening.

4
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:53,269
You're just having another nightmare.

5
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:58,347
I'm scared.

6
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:00,478
Relax... It's only a bad dream.

7
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:09,320
Jonathan. You're working too hard.
It's not good for you.

8
00:05:09,996 --> 00:05:11,537
I'm worried about you.

9
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:03,597
Good morning.

10
00:06:07,356 --> 00:06:10,740
Ah, Harker, please come up here.

11
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,200
Yes, Mr. Renfield.

12
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:25,151
I have a very important job for you.

13
00:06:27,118 --> 00:06:30,357
And I don't trust anyone else
to do it, but you.

14
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:33,199
You're very kind, Mr. Renfield.

15
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,108
Count Dracula...

16
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,339
...he sent me a letter from Transylvania.

17
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:43,418
He wants to buy a house around here.

18
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:48,325
I'm aware that it's a long trip to
go there.

19
00:06:48,763 --> 00:06:50,132
Where is that?

20
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:53,713
Somewhere over the
Carpathian mountains, isn't it?

21
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:54,880
Yes...

22
00:06:56,166 --> 00:07:00,226
...and there will be a large commission.

23
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:03,610
Oh, then I could get
a larger house for Lucy.

24
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,809
She deserves a nicer house.

25
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:11,258
Well, this won't be easy.

26
00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:14,092
It'll take you a long time...

27
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:18,069
...you'll sweat a lot...

28
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:20,994
...and perhaps you'll also...

29
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:24,275
...spill some blood.

30
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:35,645
It'll be good for me
to get out of the city...

31
00:07:39,296 --> 00:07:41,220
...get away from these canals...

32
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,637
...which go nowhere.

33
00:07:45,652 --> 00:07:47,243
Transylvania...

34
00:07:47,818 --> 00:07:51,032
...there it is, beyond the forest.

35
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:54,246
It's a wonderful place.

36
00:07:55,397 --> 00:07:57,834
A little gloomy, maybe, but very exciting.

37
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:03,541
The Count is looking
for a beautiful old house.

38
00:08:04,055 --> 00:08:07,204
I'm going to show him the big house,
near your place.

39
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,122
But it's been abandoned for years.
It looks like a haunted house.

40
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:14,946
I'm sure he'll feel
very comfortable there.

41
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:20,225
Anyway, we'll offer it to him.
I'd like you to leave soon.

42
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,323
Soon? You mean, today?

43
00:08:22,932 --> 00:08:27,976
Absolutely. I even prepared the papers.
It's bad business to let him wait.

44
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:33,082
Very well.

45
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:37,810
If you insist, I shall leave today.

46
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:44,714
Today? Are you serious?

47
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:47,691
Yes, to a castle in Transylvania.

48
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:51,887
I hear it's a strange place infested with
wolves and people who see ghosts.

49
00:08:52,473 --> 00:08:53,926
Jonathan, it scares me...

50
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:55,800
I don't want you to go.

51
00:08:55,864 --> 00:08:56,865
I'll be fine.

52
00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:58,561
You'll be in danger.

53
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,116
Don't go.

54
00:09:11,977 --> 00:09:16,004
Wolves. Bandits. And ghosts.

55
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:20,174
Don't go. I won't allow it.

56
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:26,518
Let's go to the ocean, now.
To the place where we fell in love.

57
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:31,256
Lucy...

58
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,463
...I don't know.
Sometimes I feel so ignorant.

59
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,389
Jonathan, I really have to say this...

60
00:10:43,574 --> 00:10:46,551
...even if you think it comes from...

61
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,307
...the weak heart of a woman...

62
00:10:50,814 --> 00:10:52,270
...your wife.

63
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,063
Yes?

64
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:59,451
It really comes from the strength
of my heart.

65
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:05,220
I feel a kind of...

66
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,216
...dark force...

67
00:11:07,758 --> 00:11:09,992
...like a nameless deadly fear.

68
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:29,201
Lucy is the dearest thing in the world
to me...

69
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:32,281
...take care of her.

70
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,931
Mina, treat her as a sister.

71
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,452
Yes.

72
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:20,009
Innkeeper! Quick, my supper. I must go
to the castle of Count Dracula tonight.

73
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:42,731
Are you really going there?

74
00:14:43,355 --> 00:14:44,869
Yes. Why?

75
00:14:45,988 --> 00:14:48,340
It's not a safe place.

76
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:53,338
Why do you want to go there?

77
00:14:55,131 --> 00:15:02,916
At midnight evil spirits come out.
And people disappear without a trace.

78
00:15:02,981 --> 00:15:05,551
Oh, come on, that's all superstition.

79
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:07,163
Not at all.

80
00:15:07,229 --> 00:15:11,640
Bad things will happen to you if you
go there.

81
00:15:11,706 --> 00:15:15,154
Besides, no coachman will dare
take you there...

82
00:15:15,222 --> 00:15:20,635
...your horse needs a rest
for several days.

83
00:15:21,515 --> 00:15:23,613
I'll find another horse.

84
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:30,605
Don't go, sir.

85
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:32,912
I know a few gypsies...

86
00:15:33,737 --> 00:15:38,201
...who have been on the other side...

87
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:42,418
...and they can tell you.

88
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:22,006
He also says you shouldn't go there,
young man.

89
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:49,508
He says there's a great chasm on the
way that swallows the unwary.

90
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,752
If that doesn't get you,
he says the towering crags will.

91
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:52,792
And in the Borgo pass...

92
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,900
...the light suddenly divides and...

93
00:16:56,968 --> 00:17:01,909
...the land begins to rise
towards the heavens...

94
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:04,819
...and then it drops. No one has ever
returned from that place.

95
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:25,721
The gypsies say that
no such castle exists there...

96
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:28,733
...except maybe in the imagination
of man.

97
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:34,075
There used to be a castle there. But
now it is a ghost castle. It's only a ruin.

98
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:40,024
And whoever enters into that land of
phantoms is lost...

99
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,246
...and never returns.

100
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:36,448
Of vampires and bloodsuckers.

101
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:43,986
Of corpses which devour their own flesh.
Of incubuses and succubuses.

102
00:18:44,218 --> 00:18:48,188
Of the living dead who follow strangers
in the night...

103
00:18:48,255 --> 00:18:51,400
...and attack them.
Hmm...

104
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:01,783
Transylvania... Nosferatu,
beyond death...

105
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:06,249
...a curse that will last till the end of time.

106
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:10,036
The curse of Nosferatu.

107
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:28,506
Coachman, could you take me to
the Borgo pass?

108
00:19:28,574 --> 00:19:30,029
I'll pay you well.

109
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,600
There is no road to the Borgo pass.

110
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,948
But it's right there.

111
00:19:38,505 --> 00:19:40,062
I need your coach.

112
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:42,016
I haven't got a coach.

113
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:48,030
Then I'll take one of your horses.
I'll double the price.

114
00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:50,558
Sorry, sir, but I don't have any
horses. Don't you see?

115
00:19:57,191 --> 00:19:58,226
Well...

116
00:19:58,955 --> 00:20:01,574
I guess I'll have to walk there.

117
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:38,760
Count Dracula?!

118
00:26:42,989 --> 00:26:46,889
I am Count Dracula.
Welcome to my castle.

119
00:26:47,623 --> 00:26:50,287
You must be Jonathan Harker.

120
00:26:50,353 --> 00:26:51,518
Yes.

121
00:26:53,304 --> 00:26:54,759
Come in.

122
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:59,821
The night is cold and you must be
tired and hungry.

123
00:27:39,646 --> 00:27:41,773
I've got the papers here.

124
00:27:43,738 --> 00:27:47,972
This is the layout of the house...

125
00:27:48,172 --> 00:27:50,305
...which I'm sure you'd like to see.

126
00:27:59,273 --> 00:28:02,374
Yes, yes.

127
00:28:04,608 --> 00:28:06,176
Please, help yourself.

128
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:09,885
Please, I'm afraid
you must dine alone.

129
00:28:09,953 --> 00:28:14,064
It's nearly midnight and I
partake of nothing at this hour.

130
00:28:27,503 --> 00:28:31,205
Unfortunately, the servants
are not at our disposal.

131
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:37,088
So allow me to see
to your comfort.

132
00:29:28,341 --> 00:29:30,811
Listen.

133
00:29:34,614 --> 00:29:35,583
Listen.

134
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,554
The Children of the Night
make their music.

135
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:46,095
Ah, young man...

136
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:51,498
...you're like the villagers who cannot
place themselves in the soul of the hunter.

137
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:39,653
The knife is old and could be dirty.

138
00:31:41,155 --> 00:31:43,727
It could give you blood poisoning.

139
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:47,701
Please let me do it. It's the oldest
remedy in the world.

140
00:31:47,768 --> 00:31:50,673
Oh, forget it. It's hardly worth
mentioning. Just a little cut.

141
00:32:01,607 --> 00:32:04,146
You... you know...

142
00:32:05,248 --> 00:32:07,786
...it's only for the best.

143
00:32:46,949 --> 00:32:49,824
Let's sit down for a while.

144
00:32:57,843 --> 00:33:00,850
It's still many hours till dawn.

145
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:04,559
And during the daytime
I am always away.

146
00:40:07,335 --> 00:40:09,289
Lucy, my love...

147
00:40:12,654 --> 00:40:15,635
...there is no postal service
from here...

148
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:22,267
...but I shall write a diary, preserving all
my thoughts and feelings for you.

149
00:40:22,468 --> 00:40:27,493
Last night after a tiresome journey,
I finally reached my destination...

150
00:40:28,396 --> 00:40:30,371
...the castle of Count Dracula.

151
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:35,278
I had a bad dream,
but I hope it will pass.

152
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,017
This castle is so strange.

153
00:40:38,954 --> 00:40:42,439
At times I wonder if it isn't
part of that dream.

154
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:45,185
Everything about
it looks so unreal.

155
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:26,880
I don't attach importance to the
sunshine anymore...

156
00:41:27,471 --> 00:41:30,117
...or to glittering fountains,
which youth is so fond of.

157
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:34,338
I love the darkness
and the shadows.

158
00:41:36,146 --> 00:41:39,229
Where I can be alone
with my thoughts.

159
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,827
I am the descendent
of an old family.

160
00:41:54,372 --> 00:41:58,160
Time is an abyss, profound as
a thousand nights.

161
00:42:00,406 --> 00:42:02,883
Centuries come and go...

162
00:42:04,492 --> 00:42:07,808
...to be unable to grow old is terrible.

163
00:42:08,345 --> 00:42:12,165
That is not the worst. There are
things more horrible than that.

164
00:42:14,024 --> 00:42:17,827
Can you imagine enduring centuries...

165
00:42:18,865 --> 00:42:22,853
...experiencing the same futility
each day?

166
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:29,957
I'm glad you found such a large
old house for me.

167
00:42:30,023 --> 00:42:32,739
Very near your lodging,
I understand.

168
00:42:32,939 --> 00:42:35,268
Yes, it's just around the corner.

169
00:42:35,334 --> 00:42:37,259
Ah...

170
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:40,345
...may I have a look
at the contract?

171
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:52,773
What?...

172
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,555
What a lovely throat.

173
00:42:57,432 --> 00:43:00,094
It's my wife, Lucy.

174
00:43:04,244 --> 00:43:05,206
Your hand.

175
00:43:07,316 --> 00:43:08,988
Your hand is so cold.

176
00:43:11,669 --> 00:43:14,551
The document... the contract for
the house, I must sign it immediately.

177
00:43:16,663 --> 00:43:18,808
Yes, but we haven't
settled on a price.

178
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:20,619
It doesn't matter
between gentlemen...

179
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:22,695
...I accept whatever
you find just.

180
00:43:38,005 --> 00:43:41,290
How long did it take you
to get here from Wismar?

181
00:43:41,725 --> 00:43:42,899
Four weeks.

182
00:43:48,653 --> 00:43:49,782
I...

183
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,845
...it takes a while
to travel on land.

184
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:50,844
From the seed of Belial is the
vampire born.

185
00:44:51,884 --> 00:44:55,202
He who feeds on the
blood of mankind...

186
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:02,436
...who, unredeemed, taketh
his refuge in caves, tombs...

187
00:45:02,601 --> 00:45:07,982
...coffins filled with the
unblessed soil of cemeteries...

188
00:45:08,381 --> 00:45:11,497
...wherein the black death
has reaped its harvest...

189
00:45:12,188 --> 00:45:13,894
...the plague.

190
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:25,644
Jonathan!

191
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:53,826
She has a sudden fever.

192
00:47:56,421 --> 00:47:58,983
Her pulse is too fast.

193
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:02,542
She needs to rest.

194
00:48:04,637 --> 00:48:08,053
Call me if you think
it is necessary...

195
00:48:08,657 --> 00:48:10,971
...but I don't think
it's something serious.
