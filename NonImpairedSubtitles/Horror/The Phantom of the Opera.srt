10
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:58,356
Sanctuary of song lovers,

11
00:02:58,356 --> 00:03:04,356
The Paris Opera House, rising nobly over medieval torture chambers,

12
00:03:04,356 --> 00:03:11,010
hidden dungeons, long forgotten.

13
00:04:55,388 --> 00:04:59,792
Melody floats through hall and corridor,

14
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:04,156
even to the executive offices,

15
00:05:04,156 --> 00:05:08,489
where a strange deal is being closed.

16
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:32,686
Now the Notary's seal, gentlemen,

17
00:05:32,686 --> 00:05:36,610
and you are the fortunate new owners.

18
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:10,376
It is barely possible you may hear of a ghost,

19
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:15,688
a Phantom of the Opera!

20
00:06:26,306 --> 00:06:31,686
The attendant of Box Five will not laugh

21
00:06:31,686 --> 00:06:37,162
when you ask about the opera ghost!

22
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:46,384
You jest, Messieurs! We are not children!

23
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:18,483
Who occupies Box Five?

24
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,739
I do not know.

25
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:31,392
I have seen only the cloaked figure of a man

26
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:37,760
who hides his face and will not speak!

27
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,268
Is it the Phantom?

28
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:27,393
The Phantom! The Phantom is up from the cellars again!

29
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:40,710
We saw him for an instant...a gray shadow...and he was gone!

30
00:10:41,773 --> 00:10:45,509
He had no nose!

31
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:54,264
Yes, he did, it was enormous!

32
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:31,739
That man came out of the cellars...just after we saw the Phantom.

33
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:37,502
Could it be that he...?

34
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:48,304
Joseph Buquet has really seen the Phantom! Let's ask him...

35
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:38,517
His eyes are ghastly beads in which there is no light...

36
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:43,673
like holes in a grinning skull!

37
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:55,200
His face is like leprous parchment,

38
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,688
yellow skin strung tight over protruding bones!

39
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:11,761
His nose...there is no nose!

40
00:13:33,216 --> 00:13:41,229
Have a care, Buquet...ghosts like not to be seen or talked about!

41
00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:54,304
Come, I'll show you where I saw him...

42
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:59,719
in the scene-dock of the third cellar.

43
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:33,193
I saw him there! A flash of shadow, and he was gone!

44
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:29,642
My daughter, Carlotta has been insulted!

45
00:15:29,642 --> 00:15:34,546
She, the favorite prima donna of the Paris Opera!

46
00:15:37,597 --> 00:15:43,206
Mlle Carlotte,

47
00:15:43,206 --> 00:15:49,388
Christine Daaé will sing
the role of "Marguerite", Wednesday night!

48
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:55,081
Any jealous attempt on your part to interefere with the
performance will prove disastrous to your career.

49
00:15:55,081 --> 00:16:01,049
The Phantom

50
00:16:04,661 --> 00:16:09,077
"No ghost will frighten Carlotta!

51
00:16:09,077 --> 00:16:13,684
Wednesday evening you will hear her singing!"

52
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:37,068
Wednesday night found Mlle.

53
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:44,170
Carlotta strangely ill, and Christine Daae singing "Marguerite'.

54
00:17:37,946 --> 00:17:44,083
"What is this I hear about Christine favoring some mysterious admirer.

55
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:50,114
instead of you, Raoul?"

56
00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:59,813
"Don't worry, my dear Brother-

57
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:03,702
nothing shall interfere with our love.

58
00:18:57,877 --> 00:19:03,918
"I hear alot of rumors, Raoul-be careful!"

59
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:55,744
"At last you have realized your ambition,

60
00:19:55,744 --> 00:20:01,265
my darling, and now we shall be married."

61
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:08,619
"I can never leave the Opera, Raoul.

62
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:12,781
You must forget out love."

63
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:57,223
From hidden places beyond the walls a melodious voice,

64
00:20:57,223 --> 00:21:04,584
like the voice of an angel, spoke to her.

65
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:13,782
"Christine tonight I placed the world at your feet!"

66
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,940
"To you I have imparted the full measure of my art.

67
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:43,891
You will triumph - all Paris will worship you!"

68
00:21:56,551 --> 00:22:03,014
But I warn you, you must forget all worldly things and

69
00:22:03,014 --> 00:22:09,778
think only of your career - and your Master!"

70
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:26,659
"Soon, Christine, this spirit will take form and command your love!"

71
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:37,579
"Call for me when you will. I shall be waiting."

72
00:22:52,658 --> 00:23:05,567
In Mlle. Carolotta's correspondence there appeared another letter, edged in black!

73
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:21,019
Mlle Carlotta
If you appear tomorrow night you must be prepared for a great misfortune,

74
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:28,819
and therefore I advise you to be "ill"
The Phantom

75
00:23:33,373 --> 00:23:38,789
"Christine Daae's friends are plotting again!

76
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:44,740
But my daughter shall sing tomorrow night, come what may!"

77
00:24:26,474 --> 00:24:33,268
My dear Managers -
The role of "Marguerite" shall be sung again

78
00:24:33,268 --> 00:24:40,268
tomorrow evening by Christine Daae, instead of Carlotta
The Phantom

79
00:24:40,268 --> 00:24:47,255
P.S. If you refuse this you will present Faust
in a house with a curse on it.

80
00:24:54,489 --> 00:25:03,444
Encouraged by her mother, Carlotta defied every warning,

81
00:25:03,444 --> 00:25:12,648
and the following evening appeared as - "Marguerite'.

82
00:25:46,851 --> 00:25:55,889
"So far so good - for a house with a curse on it!"

83
00:26:45,793 --> 00:26:54,665
I cannot explain, but you must never intend to see me again. - Christine

84
00:29:10,643 --> 00:29:17,519
"Beware! She is singing to bring down the chandelier!"

85
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:09,431
"Christine I have come for you -'

86
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:19,990
"I am ready, Master - waiting!"

87
00:32:29,937 --> 00:32:34,921
Walk to your mirror, my dear - - have no fear!"

88
00:33:58,633 --> 00:34:02,731
"Christine, it is I - your Master!"

89
00:34:27,594 --> 00:34:32,797
"Look not upon my mask -

90
00:34:32,797 --> 00:34:38,338
think rather of my devotion which has brought you the gift of song."

91
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:50,597
A black lake, hidden from man and the sun,

92
00:36:50,597 --> 00:36:54,772
leading to the Phantom's rendezvous.

93
00:39:54,312 --> 00:39:59,737
"I have brought you here - - five cellars underground -"

94
00:40:11,055 --> 00:40:15,097
" - because I love you!"

95
00:40:26,597 --> 00:40:32,741
"For long weary months I have awaited this hour!"

96
00:40:34,194 --> 00:40:39,772
"So that which is good within me, aroused by your purity,

97
00:40:39,772 --> 00:40:45,820
might plead for your love."

98
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,655
"That is where I sleep."

99
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:11,970
"It keeps me reminded of that other dreamless sleep that cures all ills - forever!"

100
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:24,647
"You - Your are the Phantom!"

101
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:41,257
"If I am the Phantom, it is because man's hatred has made me so."

102
00:42:48,556 --> 00:42:56,266
"If I shall be saved, it will be because your love redeems me."

103
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:08,062
"Men once knew me as Erik, but for many years I have lived in these cellars,

104
00:43:08,062 --> 00:43:14,843
a nameless legend."

105
00:44:35,103 --> 00:44:40,864
Another Phantom Tragedy

106
00:44:40,864 --> 00:44:47,727
Christine Daae Disappears

107
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:54,051
Opera Singer Mysteriously Vanishes Following Chandelier Disaster

108
00:44:56,648 --> 00:45:09,650
The night passed - a night of vague horrors -- tortured dreams--

109
00:46:44,143 --> 00:46:48,551
Christine

110
00:47:11,163 --> 00:47:17,455
My dear Christine
You are in no peril as
long as you do not touch my mask.

111
00:47:17,455 --> 00:47:24,355
You will be free as long as your love
for the spirit of Erik

112
00:47:24,355 --> 00:47:31,355
overcomes your fear.
Erik

113
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:50,602
Don Juan Triumphant

114
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:03,072
"Since first I saw your face, this music has been singing to me of you and of -

115
00:49:03,072 --> 00:49:09,954
-- love triumphant!"

116
00:49:21,827 --> 00:49:27,567
"Yet listen -- there sounds an ominous undercurrent of warning!"

117
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:26,062
"Feast, your eyes - glut your soul, on my accursed ugliness!"

118
00:51:52,397 --> 00:51:56,898
"Oh, mad Christine, who would not heed my warning!"

119
00:52:00,194 --> 00:52:05,525
"If you love me, as you say, let me go.

120
00:52:05,525 --> 00:52:11,667
I promise to your slave forever!"

121
00:52:15,112 --> 00:52:20,938
I shall prove tlo you the debth of my love.

122
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:27,238
You may return to your world for the present.

123
00:52:27,238 --> 00:52:33,911
You may sing in the opera once more."

124
00:52:37,999 --> 00:52:44,766
"But, remember, you are mine-mine-and you shall not see your lover again!

125
00:52:44,766 --> 00:52:51,912
If you do, it is death to you both!"

126
00:53:38,443 --> 00:53:46,414
"Oh, I swear it, I swear it! I shall never see him again!"

127
00:53:56,059 --> 00:54:02,979
Although I gave my word never to see you again I must.

128
00:54:02,979 --> 00:54:09,923
I will be at the Bal Masque tomorrow night,

129
00:54:09,923 --> 00:54:17,598
but not alone beware!
Christine

130
00:54:25,786 --> 00:54:34,350
One night each year, all Paris mingled, forgetful of caste--

131
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:43,512
the merry. mad Bal Masque de l'Opera.

132
00:56:17,205 --> 00:56:23,845
Into the midst of revelry, strode a spectral figure,

133
00:56:23,845 --> 00:56:30,710
robed in red.

134
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:25,739
"Beneath your dancing feet are the tombs of tortured men-

135
00:57:25,739 --> 00:57:32,198
this does the Red Death rebuke your merriment!"

136
00:58:21,503 --> 00:58:33,986
High above Paris on the roof of the Opera!

137
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:25,662
Are we alone, Raoul? Can anyone overhear what we say?

138
00:59:56,621 --> 01:00:03,437
I have seen him, Raoul! I have seen the Phantom!"

139
01:00:22,835 --> 01:00:27,780
He is a monster- a loathsome beast!

140
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:32,607
You must saveme from him, Raoul!

141
01:00:39,056 --> 01:00:45,794
Mlle. Carlotta, under the spell of his curse will never sing again.

142
01:00:45,794 --> 01:00:52,794
Tomorrow I take her place in Faust.

143
01:00:52,794 --> 01:00:59,794
After the performance you must take me away!"

144
01:01:06,139 --> 01:01:14,053
I shall be at the stage door. We will flee to England.

145
01:01:48,072 --> 01:01:51,655
She has betrayed me!

146
01:04:11,206 --> 01:04:15,167
Not that way- this way!

147
01:05:08,374 --> 01:05:12,200
That was the Opera ghost!

148
01:05:29,127 --> 01:05:35,345
-ERIK-
Born during the Boulevard Massacre
Self educated musican and master of Black Art

149
01:05:35,345 --> 01:05:41,029
Exited to Devil's Island for criminal insane

150
01:05:41,029 --> 01:05:47,488
ESCAPED
NOW AT LARGE

151
01:05:50,294 --> 01:05:59,073
This is your man. Monsleur le Prefect - The Phantom of the Opera!"

152
01:06:18,026 --> 01:06:26,984
At nine o'clock the following evening a mysterious

153
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:36,337
barouche stopped on the rotunda side of the Opera.

154
01:06:44,297 --> 01:06:49,083
Wait for me at the west gate.

155
01:07:33,458 --> 01:07:37,857
I have heard his voice once more, Raoul.

156
01:07:37,857 --> 01:07:42,069
He knows our plans -- everything."

157
01:08:18,518 --> 01:08:27,241
Believe in my love, Raoul. Save me from that monster - oh, save me!

158
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:47,051
My barouche is waiting outside.

159
01:08:47,051 --> 01:08:51,424
We leave immediately after the performance!

160
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:24,079
Dry your tears, dear, and hasten --

161
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:28,726
you must make ready for your performance!

162
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:20,355
Come quick! The strangler's work again!

163
01:10:42,231 --> 01:10:46,421
It was there!

164
01:10:48,376 --> 01:10:54,276
I saw the body dangling in the air!

165
01:11:19,786 --> 01:11:28,056
My brother - - poor Joseph, he knew too much about the Phantom!

166
01:11:39,129 --> 01:11:43,701
The Punjab lasso - the strangler's cord!

167
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:54,136
Assassin! Hide yourself in the deepest shadows

168
01:11:54,136 --> 01:11:58,904
- but I shall find you out!

169
01:13:06,032 --> 01:13:11,889
Fear for his brother's safety, brought Comte de Chagny

170
01:13:11,889 --> 01:13:18,178
to the Opera house that night.

171
01:15:14,703 --> 01:15:20,666
I think i can take you to Christine Daae

172
01:15:20,666 --> 01:15:27,056
- if you do exactly as I tell you.

173
01:15:28,883 --> 01:15:36,849
Who are you that knows the Phantom's secrets - and betrays them?

174
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:43,061
I am Ledoux of the Secret Police.

175
01:15:43,061 --> 01:15:48,549
I have studied this Phantom for months.

176
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:37,872
I found his hiding place deep within the torture chambers where he himself

177
01:16:37,872 --> 01:16:45,891
was confined during the second Revolution.

178
01:16:52,185 --> 01:16:57,350
Keep your hand up- the strangler's noose coils quick!

179
01:17:56,488 --> 01:18:03,543
Your hand up - it is a matter of life or death

180
01:18:35,692 --> 01:18:43,237
The discovery of this trap-door cost Joseph Buquet his life.

181
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,307
I am a messenger from the shadows

182
01:20:04,307 --> 01:20:08,375
-- turn back ere ye perish!

183
01:20:42,398 --> 01:20:47,721
You lied to me! Do you think you and

184
01:20:47,721 --> 01:20:53,320
your lover could cheat the Phantom?

185
01:21:00,104 --> 01:21:05,917
Ungrateful fool! You have spurned the spirit that inspired you

186
01:21:05,917 --> 01:21:11,846
-- the spirit that made you great!

187
01:21:14,849 --> 01:21:24,395
Now, you shall see the evil spirit that makes my evil face!

188
01:21:31,661 --> 01:21:39,603
No Longer like a toad in these foul cellarswill i secrete the venom of hatred -

189
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:47,850
- for you shall bring me love!

190
01:22:03,989 --> 01:22:09,319
We should be within his hiding place, now.

191
01:22:37,884 --> 01:22:42,180
We have fallen into the room of many mirrors-

192
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:46,534
- the old torture chamber!

193
01:23:11,379 --> 01:23:16,110
I am human like other men -

194
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:21,061
- I will not be cheated of my happiness!

195
01:23:31,433 --> 01:23:35,999
Raoul! Raoul! My Brother- where are you?

196
01:23:47,324 --> 01:23:50,737
It seems we have callers.

197
01:25:21,224 --> 01:25:25,143
Christine! Christine! Can you hear me?

198
01:26:08,335 --> 01:26:12,224
Your voice sounds near-

199
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:16,373
Try to find a door that will lead to us.

200
01:26:44,576 --> 01:26:49,653
Look about you - try to learn where he keeps the keys.

201
01:28:13,666 --> 01:28:18,171
The callers have departed.

202
01:29:04,393 --> 01:29:08,640
I have discovered the Phantom's hiding place

203
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:12,910
- tonight my brother will be avenged!

204
01:30:18,979 --> 01:30:22,905
Did you hear voices?

205
01:30:36,674 --> 01:30:40,737
Perhaps we have more callers.

206
01:31:08,248 --> 01:31:12,133
Heat - intolerable heat!

207
01:31:38,712 --> 01:31:46,550
Fools - do they think they can match their wits against Erik?

208
01:33:05,749 --> 01:33:10,719
What do you offer for their lives?

209
01:33:21,402 --> 01:33:28,071
Your answer. quick - they can survive but a few moments!

210
01:35:02,109 --> 01:35:03,903
Gunpowder!

211
01:35:43,763 --> 01:35:48,140
You have your chance of saving him. Will you be the bride of Erik, or do you prefer to watch your lover die?

212
01:35:48,940 --> 01:35:54,312
Will you be the bride of Erik,

213
01:35:54,312 --> 01:35:59,885
or do you prefer to watch your lover die?

214
01:36:22,630 --> 01:36:30,860
If you turn the Scorpion - you have said 'Yes' and spared de Chagny.

215
01:36:38,524 --> 01:36:47,351
Turn the grasshopper -- and the Opera House is blown to a thousand bits!

216
01:38:52,542 --> 01:39:00,257
I'll do anything you say, if you will only save them!

217
01:45:45,891 --> 01:45:52,907
