1
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Take aim.

2
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,600
Fire!

3
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,200
Unprecedented,
historic casualties.

4
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:39,000
More Americans died in
the so-called Civil War...

5
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,500
than in the two
World Wars combined.

6
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,000
618,000.

7
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Although popular media usually
portrays the Civil War...

8
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,900
as a series of epic battles
for honor and glory...

9
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,800
the reality is far from either.

10
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,500
General Sherman's march
through South Carolina alone...

11
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,900
cost over 8,000 innocent
Southerners their lives.

12
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,500
Sparing no women or children...

13
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,000
Sherman reduced the city
of Columbia to ashes overnight.

14
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,800
While you're on spring break
next week down in Florida...

15
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,400
you might better understand
why so many Southerners...

16
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,900
still are angry at the North...

17
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,400
and their rampage of
death and destruction.

18
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,200
I get it.

19
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,600
Their fashion might be
a little bit out of date.

20
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,100
Rest assured
one day in the future...

21
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,400
your grandkids will be
laughing at photos of you.

22
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,300
Shit.

23
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,700
All right, all right,
settle down.

24
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,400
One of the big problems
for the Southerners...

25
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,800
Fucking piece of shit!
God damn it!

26
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,800
Nelson!

27
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,700
It's jammed, sir.

28
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,800
What's going on?

29
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh, God.

30
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,500
Have a nice break.
See you in two weeks.

31
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,300
You, you, you... stay!

32
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,000
It's about respect,
gentlemen.

33
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,900
Respect for me...

34
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,000
respect for
the subject matter...

35
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,300
but, most of all,
respect for yourselves.

36
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,100
Papers like this...

37
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,600
"General Sherman:
A Total Badass"...

38
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,100
ain't going to cut it.

39
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,100
Your antics today
clearly demonstrated...

40
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,600
how serious you are
about your studies.

41
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,900
You, Anderson,
you missed class yesterday.

42
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,600
Actually,
I didn't miss it at all.

43
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,300
You think
this is very funny, eh?

44
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,300
This university
won't miss any of you...

45
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,300
next semester
when you're expelled.

46
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,300
That is, unless
you all turn in...

47
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,600
three new term papers...

48
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,900
by, let's say,
the end of spring break.

49
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,100
Let me remind you
of an old saying...

50
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,500
Those who don't
learn from history...

51
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,400
are doomed to repeat it.

52
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,700
Gentlemen,
the party's over.

53
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,200
Vilano Beach,
Palm Beach, Palm Coast.

54
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,100
Daytona!

55
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,100
Aw, shut the fuck up.

56
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,200
How much farther are we?

57
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,500
I don't know.
It's not even that bad.

58
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,000
Daytona is
another eight hours.

59
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,000
It's in Florida.
It's heavy-duty.

60
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,000
Dump the fuckin' map.
I'll find us a shortcut.

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,100
Dude, this is so nice, man.

62
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,300
Why do we even
want to go to Florida?

63
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,200
We should just
stay right here.

64
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,000
Have you guys taken a moment
to look around you?

65
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,900
Look at this place!

66
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,700
Oh, yeah.
It's fuckin' awesome.

67
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,500
I love the smell
of cow shit in the morning.

68
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,900
Take it all in, boys.
Sniff it.

69
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,900
All right, all right,
all right.

70
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,500
I know what I'm gonna
write my term paper on.

71
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,200
"Cow Shit of the South:
The Smell of Victory."

72
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,600
Dudes!

73
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,400
The whole point was getting away
from history class.

74
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,200
Fuck!
What the fuck is this?!

75
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,300
Who is this guy?

76
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,200
What the fuck?

77
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,300
That was my armadillo.

78
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,600
We've been tracking that
all day.

79
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,300
You totally wasted it.

80
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,300
L... I'm sorry, man.
I didn't see it.

81
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,900
It was like it fell out
of the sky, dude, I swear.

82
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,500
Tell you what.
Lf, you know, if you give...

83
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,700
me and Dr. Mambo
here a lift...

84
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,800
you know, we'll
totally call it even.

85
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,900
Dr. Mambo?

86
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,100
Where you guys heading?
South.

87
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,300
Daytona Beach.

88
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Awesome!

89
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,800
Awesome! Let me
get my pack, dude.

90
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Yeah, hop in, man.

91
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Go.

92
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,900
Face!

93
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,700
The way I see it...

94
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
if we drive
through the night...

95
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,200
we'll be quaffing beers
by noon...

96
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,900
and boffing chicks
by 5:00.

97
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,800
And pushin' up
daisies by midnight.

98
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,200
Go, banjo boy, go!

99
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,000
Holy...

100
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,700
fucking...

101
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
shit.

102
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, God, man. I could
drink her bath water.

103
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,300
Dude, I'd eat the peanuts
out of her shit.

104
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
She's not your type, dog.

105
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,800
Trust me.

106
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,900
Dude, if she has a pulse,
she's my type.

107
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,900
Watch and learn.

108
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,900
Hey, man.

109
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,500
What's up, dude?

110
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,100
Not much. Just going on
a road trip with the ladies.

111
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,300
Where are you guys heading?

112
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,300
Daytona Beach.

113
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,300
My brother's
got a beach house.

114
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,500
On the beach.

115
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,200
Yeah. Must be fate.

116
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,500
Must be.

117
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,500
We're headed there mañana.

118
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,900
Cool.

119
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,600
Well, I was thinking that...

120
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,000
We should all hook up
when you guys hit town.

121
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
You got a number, hon?

122
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,100
You wouldn't happen
to have a pen or paper?

123
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,300
Who needs paper?

124
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,700
You know what, ma'am?

125
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,500
I couldn't agree
with you more.

126
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,900
So, what's
your name, cowboy?

127
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,300
Anderson.

128
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,100
Whenever you're finished,
you can come up for air...

129
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,000
Anderson.

130
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,000
What is your name?

131
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,600
Oh, I'll tell you...

132
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,700
if I call.

133
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,300
Later, boys.

134
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,700
On the beach.

135
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,100
Was that a score?

136
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,500
I can't really say.

137
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,700
She'll call.
She wants the house.

138
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,800
OK. We're in
"Deliverance" country now.

139
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,100
So, unless
you're into squealing...

140
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,700
like Porky Pig's
love bitch, Nelson...

141
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,900
we need a shortcut.

142
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,700
You guys
have no faith, man.

143
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,400
Let's go.

144
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,900
Nice overalls, dude.

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,500
Pushin' up daisies
by midnight.

146
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,100
Yep, we're lost.

147
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,900
Great.

148
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,600
Anderson, you got the map?

149
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,600
Of course you don't.

150
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,700
It's in the trunk.

151
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,300
Trunk? Yeah.

152
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,500
Way to stay up
with me, guys.

153
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
I got to do
all the driving while they...

154
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
It's midnight, boy.

155
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,100
Man, shut up!
Hey, hey, hey.

156
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,500
It's just a dream.

157
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,600
Dream, whatever.

158
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,400
Where the fuck are we?

159
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,800
You took a shortcut,
didn't you, Nelson?

160
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,400
Look. I tried to wake you
two douche bags, all right?

161
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
This is your fault, too,
kind of.

162
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,300
Our fault?

163
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,600
Yeah. I mean, no.

164
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,800
Guys, look, sign, all right?

165
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,800
Detour sign.

166
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,800
Enough. Get out
of the front seat.

167
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,600
Come on. Get out. Get out.

168
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,100
I'm driving.
That's it. That's it.

169
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,000
Later! Shit!

170
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Wait up!

171
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Ass munches.

172
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,300
- Get him.
- Ow! Hey!

173
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,300
I can't reach him.

174
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,300
Ow! You cinched my sack.

175
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,800
Ow, bitch!

176
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,500
I just want
to go to the beach!

177
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,500
This isn't
a real detour.

178
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,000
Where the hell are we?

179
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,200
Check it out.

180
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Looks like it's abandoned.

181
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,900
What the hell is that?

182
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
This place
is like a ghost town.

183
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,800
Welcome
to Pleasant Valley.

184
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,000
Well, don't be
a wet ding dong, fellas.

185
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,100
Buckman's the name.

186
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,000
Mayor's my game.

187
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,100
Now, why don't y'all here
give us a big howdy do, hmm?

188
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,300
Anderson Lee.
Nice to meet you, sir.

189
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,600
Uh, my two partners here
go by...

190
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,900
Lee? Lee. Anderson Lee.

191
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,100
My, my, my,
what a beautiful surname you...

192
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,800
Y'all ain't from
the South, now, are you?

193
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,200
Born and raised, sir.

194
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,400
Lived in South Carolina
till freshman year.

195
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,300
Then you crossed over
to the other side, I see.

196
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,900
Well, well, we might
just save you yet.

197
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,000
You see, y'all arrived...

198
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,700
just in time to be
our honored guests...

199
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,700
at the Guts 'n' Glory
Jubilee.

200
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,100
Dude, I say we get
the hell out of Dodge.

201
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,900
Like, my brother's
waiting on us, bro.

202
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,400
Well, good morning,
Miss Peaches.

203
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,600
If I supply the peaches...

204
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,500
do you think you boys
could supply the cream?

205
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,400
We're staying.

206
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,700
At least for five minutes.

207
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,800
Well, looky here.

208
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,200
Appears we got more guests
fresh on the way.

209
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,000
What?

210
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,500
Pussy wagon's here.

211
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,900
Well, don't that beat all?

212
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,800
You all the prettiest
damn Yanks I ever seen.

213
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,200
Jesus Christ, it's Toon Town.

214
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,900
Toony Town?

215
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,800
Son, this is Pleasant Valley.

216
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,500
And for the next two days...

217
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,300
it's gonna be nothing
but dancing and games.

218
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,800
And best of all...

219
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,100
a mouth-watering...
mmm, mmm... barbecue.

220
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,500
Let me guess.

221
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Detour sign?

222
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Detour sign.

223
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
What do you think?

224
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,800
I'm game for anything.

225
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,900
Tell you what.

226
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,300
You stay, we'll stay.

227
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,500
Cool.

228
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,300
Judas Priest.

229
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,800
We got ourselves
two more Yanks for the jubilee.

230
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,900
What the hell
kind of detour was that?

231
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,300
Negro and Chinaman
to boot.

232
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,800
That's Chinawoman.

233
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,100
And what a woman!

234
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,600
Well, don't just
stand around, folks.

235
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,800
Granny's got rooms
waiting on you at the hotel.

236
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,700
Come on!

237
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,600
Come on!

238
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,200
Welcome to
Granny Boone's hotel.

239
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,000
'Sup?

240
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,800
I don't think so, Amos.

241
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,000
- I'm Hester.
- And I'm Glendora.

242
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,700
Granny Boone said we're supposed
to show you to your rooms.

243
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,900
You girls want
to burn some blunts?

244
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,400
You know, spleef?

245
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,100
Reefer.

246
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,200
You two are so lucky
you're hotties.

247
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,700
Any more luggage, boy?

248
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,700
Boy?

249
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,700
Ain't y'all motherfuckers
ever heard...

250
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,100
of the Civil Rights Movement?

251
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,200
Is that anything
like a bowel movement?

252
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,400
What, are you out
of your fuckin' mind?

253
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,800
Kick back, hon.

254
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,800
Granny Boone done wash out
some fresh sheets for ya.

255
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Guess you people aren't wearing
those things any more, huh?

256
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,000
Tell me, where do black folks
hang out around here?

257
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,800
From off that tree
down there yonder, usually.

258
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,200
Oh, you want
to get down, huh? All right.

259
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,000
Chill, baby.
I don't think our bellhick...

260
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,600
is playing
with a full deck here.

261
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,700
Granny Boone say we got to
please all our festival guests.

262
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,300
Even you.

263
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,100
Well, we wouldn't wanna...

264
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
piss old Granny Boone off,
now, would we?

265
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,100
All right then,
that's more like it.

266
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,500
Now, remember...

267
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,200
dinner is
at seven P.M. Sharp.

268
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,700
And Granny Boone,
she hates tardiness.

269
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,400
Well, then y'all
best leave us to prepare.

270
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,400
OK, then.

271
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,100
I bid you adieu.

272
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,300
That's German
for I'll see you later.

273
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,000
Shit we got to go through
for a free meal.

274
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,200
Come on, Malcolm.

275
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,700
A little old-fashioned
hospitality might be fun.

276
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,700
Fuck old-fashioned
hospitality.

277
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
I'd rather fuck you.

278
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,600
Oh, shit.

279
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,600
This sure is a fine reenactment
setup they've got going here.

280
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,700
I ever tell you how much I love
Civil War tourist attractions?

281
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,100
Don't y'all mind us none.

282
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,400
Jezebel!

283
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,600
Come here,
you little mutton chops.

284
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,100
I say to hell with Daytona.

285
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,200
I, sir, am in accordance.

286
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,800
You know, I never knew
you were Southern.

287
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,100
I was raised
by my Aunt Charlotte.

288
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,300
She was old-school Southern.

289
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,700
She taught me to open
the door for the ladies...

290
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,400
say, "Yes, ma'am"
"Why, no, ma'am."

291
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,500
You sure unlearned
that shit fast.

292
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Right, Cory.

293
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,200
It's still in me
in the background.

294
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,600
School's in session!

295
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,300
My misguided spawn.

296
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,600
Now, why in the hell
did you let them two devils

297
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,500
in Pleasant Valley, hmm?

298
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,000
Lord knows I don't cotton
to waiting on a darky...

299
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,000
and... however,
in service to the festival...

300
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,600
Mmm, well,
it'll all be over soon.

301
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,800
Looks like Miss Peaches...

302
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
done snagged herself
a Yankee boy already.

303
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,600
I got my eye
on that purty one

304
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,800
with them long legs leading
up to them tender buttocks.

305
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,100
Now, now, now.

306
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,300
You leave her
to Harper, boy.

307
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,200
That tasty dish
don't stand a chance...

308
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,200
once he walk up on her.

309
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,500
Am I right
or am I right?

310
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,800
Trouble

311
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Trouble

312
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,200
Came a-knockin'

313
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,700
Came a-knockin'

314
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,300
Trouble

315
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,200
Trouble

316
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,500
Came a-knockin'

317
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Came a-knockin'

318
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,800
Trouble

319
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,100
Is this place a hoot
or what?

320
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,800
Can you believe
these hicks actually think...

321
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,300
we're gonna sleep
in separate beds?

322
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,600
Well, I say we hang,
grab whatever we can...

323
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,400
and blow.

324
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,100
The whole town
or just those frat boys?

325
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,600
Don't worry, Ricky,
I'll save one for you.

326
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,600
What about
saving one for me?

327
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,900
Now, which one
would that be...

328
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,500
perhaps Mr. "I'll stay
if you stay"?

329
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,800
To our door

330
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,700
Hey, handsome.

331
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,000
Hello, everybody.

332
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,500
On behalf of
our little town...

333
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm here to welcome y'all...

334
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,600
and invite you to taking in
some of our sites.

335
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,600
I'll wrestle you for him.

336
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,800
What's that?

337
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Nothing.

338
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,100
Just ignore him.

339
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,700
Dang, Jethro.

340
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,200
You got
some muscles there.

341
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,500
It's Harper, ma'am.

342
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,100
Harper Alexander.

343
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,400
I'm Kat...

344
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,900
as in pussy.

345
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,900
This is Joey,
this is Ricky.

346
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,100
Perhaps if Miss Pussycat
is willing...

347
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,900
the sun
sure looks mighty nice...

348
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
reflecting on the lake
right about now.

349
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,300
Miss Pussycat
is more than willing.

350
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,400
Well, then,
I guess I'll be seeing...

351
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,800
you other fine folks
at the festival.

352
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,000
If you will.

353
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,200
Wait, Kat.

354
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,500
It's my good-luck
dog tag.

355
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

356
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,500
Is there anything
you wouldn't do?

357
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,800
Later, kitty cat.

358
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,100
Welcome, welcome.

359
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,400
Don't tell me.
You must be Miss Boone.

360
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,000
It's a real pleasure
to meet you, ma'am.

361
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,800
Oh, Miss Boone, from
the bottom of our hearts...

362
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,900
we thank you
for such fine accommodations.

363
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,500
Oh, don't make me blush.

364
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,300
And that's Granny
to you, sonny boy.

365
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,500
Y'all like my ladies?

366
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,000
Yes, ma'am.

367
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,600
Y'all ready
for a good ole time?

368
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Yes, ma'am.

369
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,700
So...

370
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,800
Gosh dang it.

371
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,700
Kitty's getting away.

372
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,100
Come here,
you stupid cat.

373
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,100
Get over here.

374
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,600
Why don't you gentlemen
give him a hand?

375
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,700
All right.

376
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,100
See you soon, boys.

377
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,000
Is this some hillbilly
reality show type of thing?

378
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,100
You know this is Georgia,
Miss Pussycat.

379
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,400
Harper, try just
calling me Kat.

380
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,500
Miss Pussy
sounds so formal.

381
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,000
Well, Kat...

382
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,500
how could one not but smile
whilst in the company...

383
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,200
of such a beautiful Northern
sophisticrat like yourself.

384
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,900
You're either the most
romantic guy I've ever met...

385
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,900
or you're completely
full of shit.

386
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,200
- Come here.
- Get back here, kitty.

387
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,300
I ain't gonna hurt ya.

388
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,200
Come on, guys.

389
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,100
Come here, kitty.

390
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,900
My daddy proposed to my mama
right here on this spot.

391
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,700
My daddy proposed to my mom
in the back of a '69 chevy.

392
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,300
Course that was
before the troubles.

393
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,500
Before all that fire done
burnt this spot to the ground.

394
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,700
Feels like a fire
right now.

395
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,300
You know, life always finds
a way of pushing itself...

396
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
up through death, Miss Kat.

397
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,300
Feels like
something else is trying...

398
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,600
to push its way
through now, baby.

399
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,000
You like horses?

400
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,100
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

401
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,500
Come here,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

402
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,700
Come on. Come on,
you little cat.

403
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,800
Once again, Anderson Lee
showing how to get pussy.

404
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,800
Thanks, mister.

405
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,000
Name's Hucklebilly.

406
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,600
Hey, what's up,
Huckleberry?

407
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,800
It's Hucklebilly,
dumb ass.

408
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,000
Damn. Feisty little fella.

409
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,700
Y'all wanna play
a little game with me?

410
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
I don't know, Hucklebilly.

411
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,300
We got some ladies
waiting for us...

412
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,600
if you know what I mean.

413
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,500
Yeah. Heck with it, then.

414
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,700
Oh, come on.

415
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,100
The little kid
has no one to play with.

416
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Poor little circus clown.

417
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,600
How about that roll in the hay
you were talking about?

418
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,800
Make me scream
that rebel yell.

419
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,500
Well, that, ma'am,
I can guarantee.

420
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,900
You just lay
right here, OK?

421
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,200
I didn't know
my Southern gentleman

422
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,400
had a touch of kink
in him.

423
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,300
If a kink means
a hunger for you, ma'am...

424
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,800
then that he does.

425
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,500
Hey, look, dude.

426
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
We're sorry.

427
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,100
Leave me alone.

428
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,500
Hey, we'll play a game
with you, all right?

429
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,000
What do you got in mind?

430
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,700
It's called
Kill the Kitty.

431
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,600
- Shit.
- See, kitty's been bad.

432
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,000
Real bad.

433
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,400
I'm gonna lynch her.

434
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,300
And y'all
can be the witnesses!

435
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
All right.

436
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,700
What would
your mother think...

437
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,800
if you hurt
that poor little kitty?

438
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,100
My mama?

439
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Mister, my mama give me
a silver dollar...

440
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,900
for every broke-neck pussy
I bring home.

441
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
Harper, honey...

442
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,800
this isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

443
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,500
Well, Miss Pussy,
it's exactly what I had in mind.

444
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,500
Now, I know you city folk
think us country boys naive...

445
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,800
in the ways of love...

446
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,100
but we ain't as innocent
as you might think.

447
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,700
I mean...

448
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,400
I think this might be taking it
just a little too far.

449
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,300
Frankly, Miss Pussy,
I don't give a damn.

450
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,300
Yee-haw!

451
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,600
Ow.

452
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,500
I know it's not etiquette...

453
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,200
to eat without
everyone present...

454
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,400
but a little birdie
advised me...

455
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,800
that perky friend of yours
is gonna be a little bit tardy.

456
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,900
So let us pray.

457
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,000
Dear Lord...

458
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,800
we thank you for the food
we are about to eat...

459
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,500
that makes us whole
in mind, body, and soul.

460
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,600
Amen.

461
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,900
Dig in.

462
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,100
I'm so hungry
I could eat an entire goat...

463
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,200
and not share
a single hoof.

464
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,300
Disgusting.

465
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,700
Huckleberry's
got the munchies.

466
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,200
It's Hucklebilly,
pig breath.

467
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,900
Can't you Northern folks
get nothing right?

468
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,700
Miss Boone...

469
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,400
Excuse me, Granny.

470
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,900
You've simply
outdone yourself.

471
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,900
Thank you.

472
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,000
Hear, hear.

473
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,200
Sure looks tasty. Mmm.

474
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,700
Speaking of tasty...

475
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,900
it appears that, uh,
our Harper Alexander...

476
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,700
has done gone and swept
your Miss Kitty Cat here...

477
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,800
off her feet.

478
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,300
Lucky bitch.

479
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
Guest or no guest...

480
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,800
I will not tolerate
swearing at my table.

481
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,000
Just ignore him.

482
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,800
Jealousy always gets
in the way of his manners.

483
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,900
Jealousy?

484
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,800
Kat always bags
the fine guys first.

485
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,900
Just once I wish
she was the one eating...

486
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,100
sloppy seconds.

487
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,800
May I offer you some
fresh milk with your pie?

488
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,700
I... l... I think...
I think you just did.

489
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,100
I'll keep my jug handy.

490
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,500
Holy mother of God.

491
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,500
Is this seat taken, miss?

492
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,800
What if I said it was?

493
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,500
Well, I guess
I'd have to tell you...

494
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
what a mistake
you've made...

495
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,300
and what an opportunity
you've missed.

496
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,000
I guess I couldn't
give you these.

497
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,200
How... romantic.

498
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,400
You ever hear of
a sixty-second romance?

499
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,900
Got a minute?

500
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,700
I got all night.

501
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,100
You listen up careful now.

502
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,700
Harper done did his duty
for the festival

503
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,100
with that Yankee filly.

504
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,100
Time's now come
for you two to do yours.

505
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,900
That's a mighty big noose
you got there for a cat.

506
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,900
Who says
it's for a cat, jug head?

507
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,000
Why, if you even think
of hurting Jezebel...

508
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,900
Shut your mouth now,
Lester.

509
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,300
Leave that boy alone.

510
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,000
Been meaning to talk
to you about Jezebel.

511
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Is, uh, this mutton chop
at least a girlie?

512
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,000
She's a woman
to you, Daddy.

513
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,800
Now, if y'all excuse us...

514
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,900
come on, baby.

515
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,800
Now, Daddy. Daddy,
don't mind Lester none.

516
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,600
I got full confidence
in him.

517
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,900
Son, one time I had
full confidence in a fart.

518
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,800
Shit all over myself.

519
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,800
Hey, perv.

520
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,600
Hey, chick with milk jugs
walk by?

521
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,500
She was headed
toward the cow pasture...

522
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,900
crying your name.

523
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,600
When you're finished
with your boyfriend...

524
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,100
you know where to find me.

525
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,700
What?

526
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,800
Gentlemen...

527
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,300
I believe it is time
for another toast.

528
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,100
Hit me, bartender.

529
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,300
To the ties
that bind...

530
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
friendship...

531
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,200
and in this case...

532
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,000
the fine folks
of Pleasant Valley!

533
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,200
Three queens.

534
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,100
What?

535
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,200
Nothing.

536
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,400
Bitch.

537
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,400
I feel like we're in
a Confederate frat party.

538
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,400
You know what I always say?

539
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,300
The only difference between
a frat boy and a gay boy...

540
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,000
is a six-pack of beer.

541
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,100
You know it's true.

542
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,800
Hmm.

543
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,700
And, uh, remind Lester...

544
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,900
that he has to cornhole
that sissy boy.

545
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,700
I know... I know it goes
against the good Lord.

546
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,400
I'll do it, Daddy!

547
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,900
That's nothing to get
excited about, Rufus.

548
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,900
God damn it.

549
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,500
Come on, Rufus,
put your weight into it.

550
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,600
That's right, girl.

551
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,000
Get him, Pretty Ricky.

552
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,200
Oh! Miss Angry.

553
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,200
You got angry muscles.

554
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Big-ass muscles.

555
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,500
Come on.

556
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,600
Not you.

557
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,500
See ya, dude.

558
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,300
Come on, Rick.

559
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,400
God damn.

560
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,600
Winner does the pitching,
loser does the catching.

561
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,500
Ah, screw that.

562
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,700
Even you're
gonna get laid?

563
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
That's right.

564
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,300
Don't whack it too hard.

565
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,400
Come on, girl.

566
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,300
God.

567
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,100
And to all, a good night.

568
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,500
Uh-uh. Not yet, boy.

569
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
Oh, take it off.

570
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,700
Take it all off.

571
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,300
Get away.

572
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,400
This what you wanted?

573
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,500
Nelson!

574
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:19,300
Oh, Nelson!

575
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,500
Surprise!

576
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,100
Holy shit.

577
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,000
Oh, my God. I've been thinking
about you all night.

578
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,200
You gonna invite me in...

579
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,200
or just stand there
polishing your musket?

580
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,000
Damn right
I'm gonna invite you in.

581
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,200
Peek-a-boo.

582
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
Whoa.

583
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,000
That was fast.

584
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,200
Hey, nice to see ya.

585
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,700
Got milk?

586
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,800
Milk?

587
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,200
So, wanna get to know
each other a little bit maybe?

588
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,600
Maybe even tell me your name.

589
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,900
Nope.

590
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,300
Oh, yeah.

591
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,600
Oh... oh, my God.

592
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,700
You know, uh, my mom
never had to say to me...

593
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,600
"Drink your milk, poopy."

594
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,200
Poopy?

595
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,600
My mom
used to call me poopy.

596
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,000
Long story.

597
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,800
Very long.

598
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,100
Honey, do you
want to talk...

599
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,000
or have
a little fun?

600
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,100
Have some fun.

601
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,200
That's what I thought.

602
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,300
What the hell is that?

603
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,600
Is that a milk bong?

604
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,200
Silly boy.

605
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,700
This is special moonshine
I made just for you.

606
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,400
You gonna suck it?

607
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,600
Look, moonshine
is not really my thing.

608
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
I'm more into beer
and... and things like that.

609
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,000
Are you a boy or a man?

610
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
A man, God damn it.

611
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,400
Suck it, mister man.

612
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,000
I prefer a nonsmoker.

613
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,900
The South's
gonna rise again

614
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,900
The South's
gonna rise again

615
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,400
Hey, Opie man.

616
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,000
I'll give you a dollar
if you can get Z.Z. Top...

617
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
to play some Hendrix.

618
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,900
So, how'd it go?

619
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,800
Well, it was
extraordinary.

620
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,400
Yeah, we talked
till 3:00.

621
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,500
Mind sex, bro.

622
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,800
Mind sex?

623
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,800
Miss Ricky
don't mind sex, does she?

624
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,800
No, she doesn't.

625
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,800
Looks like Cupid's arrow
hit somebody...

626
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,000
in the ass
last night.

627
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,000
Wasn't my ass
that got hit.

628
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,200
I was the one
shooting the arrows.

629
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,900
Well, buttermilk pancakes.

630
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,200
If it ain't
our honored guests...

631
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,400
just in time to inaugurate
the grandest jubilee ever!

632
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,200
Well, shoot dang,
Mayor Bumpkin.

633
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,200
If this ain't
the bestest festival ever.

634
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,800
Hee-haw.

635
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,000
I would not besmirch...

636
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,900
the sincerity and efforts
of our proud little town here...

637
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,600
if I were you, sir.

638
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,400
A great price has been paid
to ensure the success...

639
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,300
of this festival.

640
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,000
Whoa. Excuse me, sir.

641
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,100
We're...

642
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,800
we're just a little
hungover, you know...

643
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,200
hair of the dog.

644
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,300
Apology accepted,
Mr. Lee.

645
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,000
Well, guess we're staying.

646
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,900
Guess so.

647
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,600
Hey, anybody seen Kat?

648
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,500
Anybody seen Nelson?

649
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,900
Ten to one
he's hitting it.

650
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,100
What did you do
to Miss Kitty Cat?

651
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,600
Well, I didn't get to do
anything with her, mister.

652
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,500
Like he said, that big rough
and tumble Connecticut boy

653
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,000
done stoled her from me.

654
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,100
Nelson?

655
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,900
- And Kat?
- Sure enough.

656
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,900
I was doing my best
to court her properly.

657
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,900
That boy cut right in.

658
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
All right, y'all.

659
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
Quit your dilly-dallying.

660
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,800
Boys with the boys...

661
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,000
and ladies with the ladies.

662
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,600
Well, now...

663
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,900
let's all get
this party started.

664
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,100
Yee-haw

665
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,200
You ever seen
a kissing meadow?

666
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,400
Hell no.

667
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
You want to see one?

668
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,500
Hell yeah.

669
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,500
Oh, man.

670
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,000
When in Rome.

671
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,900
Come on, China girl.

672
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,500
Let's get you
all cleaned up.

673
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,300
Ole Granny Boone
done cooked up...

674
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,500
one hell of a roast
with this one here.

675
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,900
Yes, sir.

676
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,800
Granny Boone gonna have her
hands full for the festival.

677
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,000
Can't wait to taste
the rest of her at the barbecue.

678
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,600
You know,
like I always say...

679
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,600
two heads
are better than one.

680
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,800
What's the deal with
these people, anyway, huh?

681
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,000
It's like
a damn time tunnel.

682
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,200
Oh, come on.
Just admit it.

683
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,100
You guys aren't
used to old-fashioned...

684
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,300
unspoiled Southern manners.

685
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,500
Hey, I'm digging it.
This place is a trip.

686
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,500
Sure is.

687
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,700
After you done turned
a curious country boy...

688
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,200
against all
that's right and decent.

689
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,600
He wasn't bad
for a beginner.

690
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,800
Oh, shit.

691
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,600
You ever taken
a turn at the shoes?

692
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,300
Not since I was a kid.

693
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,900
That's the thing, friend.

694
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,600
You need to get better practice
at the manly arts...

695
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,300
hunting and soldiering
and whatnot.

696
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,700
That has what
to do with horseshoes?

697
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,600
Horseshoes is
a military game in origin.

698
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,900
Goes back to French trappers'
method of gapping mink...

699
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,000
as they called it.

700
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,700
She's just playing hard to get.

701
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,900
Jezebel!

702
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,200
Now, the good Lord
has blessed each one of us...

703
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,000
with distinct virtues.

704
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,000
And it is our responsibility
as ladies...

705
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,400
to figure out what they are
and how to use them.

706
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,700
I got the gift of tongues.

707
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,400
I got it
from my step-pappy...

708
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,700
the Reverend Jonas.

709
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,800
Bet the reverend's
a very proud man.

710
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,000
He is.

711
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,500
I hope you all will allow us
to share our ways.

712
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,200
You were shy and rough...

713
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,300
but under them
Northern exteriors...

714
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,900
I think y'all gonna
clean up real good.

715
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,700
Rubba dub dub.

716
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,900
Who wants me
in their tub?

717
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,700
Nobody.
And get some pants...

718
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
on that little
ding dong of yours.

719
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
Shoot, Granny.

720
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,200
Today's my turn
in the barrel.

721
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,400
My, oh, my.

722
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,700
Here we are.

723
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,200
Place where
I got my first kiss.

724
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,600
Me, too.

725
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,000
Of course, you, too.

726
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,200
You're the one
who kissed me.

727
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,600
You are
my first cousin.

728
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,900
Who else
was gonna do it?

729
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,300
Whoa. Wait a sec.

730
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,900
- You're cousins?
- Mm-hmm.

731
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,700
Cool.

732
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,800
I thought
you'd never ask.

733
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,600
The napkin.

734
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,500
You can watch
from over there...

735
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
if you're quiet.

736
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,100
Fuck, yeah.

737
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,500
You, sir, are a pig!

738
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,700
What?

739
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,100
A pig.

740
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,600
You're boning your cousin
and I'm the pig?

741
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,500
Go away, boy.

742
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,200
But you said
I could watch.

743
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,100
But you weren't quiet.

744
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,000
So...

745
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,500
What exactly
do we do here?

746
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,900
Gap, gentleman.

747
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,800
Refer to the part of the mink
that's not there after the toss.

748
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,200
Most usually the head.

749
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Fuck.

750
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,500
Whatever, dude.

751
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,800
'Scuse me.

752
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,400
Let me get
that shot there, playboy.

753
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,200
Hold my beer there, Rufie.

754
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,300
Watch the style.

755
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,200
Shit!

756
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,600
Fuck y'all.

757
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,000
Philly ain't exactly, uh...

758
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,200
horse country.

759
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,900
The dog is in the house.

760
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,900
Hey, lucky.

761
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,700
Why don't you try
your luck at this.

762
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,300
Maybe it will work
out better for you.

763
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,800
Hell is that?

764
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,100
That's a mink
or something.

765
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,300
Go on, gap it.

766
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,600
Gap it!

767
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,300
Son of a bitch!

768
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,000
You must've
gotten some.

769
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,400
Done real good.

770
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,000
Ooh, my, my, my.

771
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,200
So very pretty.

772
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,600
Don't you make a heavenly
Southern belle.

773
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,000
Miss Joey, you're gonna be
the next one to steal my heart.

774
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,200
Um, I don't think so.

775
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,900
Think role-playing, babe.

776
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,700
I know my man is gonna want
to hit this when he sees it.

777
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,200
Now you're talking
like a real Southern lady.

778
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,300
Well, gosh darn it, heck.

779
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,500
Ain't you the prettiest
little thing I ever saw?

780
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,000
Easy, Cinderella.

781
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,400
Well, if that ain't the pot
calling the kettle black.

782
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,800
By the way, Joey, your...

783
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,500
little boy Anderson
is looking for you.

784
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,500
Thank God.

785
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,000
Saved by the bell.

786
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,900
Leah.

787
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,800
Ladies, have fun.

788
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,200
Don't you pay her
no mind.

789
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,700
Later, Rick.

790
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,500
Let the hoedown begin.

791
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,200
Whoo-hoo!

792
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,400
Grab your partner
and give her a whirl

793
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,100
Whoo, yeah!

794
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,200
Now twinkle your hair
and give it a twirl

795
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,300
Whoo-hoo!

796
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,100
Slap your backside,
lift your arms

797
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,700
All right!

798
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,400
'Cause the cows and the chickens
is returning to the barn

799
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,700
Little china doll,
ain't you sweet

800
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,100
Whoo, yeah!

801
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,500
I reckon you'll make
a tasty treat

802
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,500
Now dance right up
to the podium of honor

803
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,100
Oh, yeah!

804
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,300
And let's bestow
the honor upon her

805
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,900
Yee-hoo!

806
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,900
- Golden china girl
- What?

807
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,900
Cute butt

808
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,200
Whoo-hoo!

809
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,300
Perky little breasts, yeah

810
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,400
Ooh, I want one

811
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,500
Time has come to do
what's right

812
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,400
- Right!
- Right!

813
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,600
'Ccause we've only begun
to renew the fight

814
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,000
Ooh, yeah!

815
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,600
To avenge the horror
that occurred in this place

816
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,700
Oh, yeah!

817
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,700
Oh, yeah!

818
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,600
- It's your maker, now, bitch...
- Huh?

819
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,200
You'll have to face.

820
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,400
That Chinawoman...

821
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,700
had a lot of guts.

822
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,700
Need a hand?

823
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,200
Joey.

824
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,700
Now, where do you think
you're going?

825
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,200
Where'd you get that?

826
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,900
Your friend
gave it to me.

827
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,700
But Ricky gave that to Kat
for good luck.

828
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,300
Uh-huh. Be that as it may,
it's mine now.

829
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,200
Sorry.
That must be a mistake.

830
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,400
Give it back to me.

831
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,200
I'll give it to Kat.

832
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,900
We're getting ready to go.

833
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,000
Oh, you're not leaving.

834
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,700
No, Peaches.

835
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,200
We are.

836
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,100
Good luck.

837
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,900
Back up off me.

838
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,100
You got it.

839
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,000
You right on time.

840
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,700
Well, well...

841
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,100
I see the festivities
are in full swing.

842
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,400
Are we enjoying
ourselves yet, ladies?

843
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,100
Your son fucking loved it.

844
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,100
Uh-uh, the girl's
having so much fun...

845
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,000
he can't stand it.

846
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,500
He squealed like a pig.

847
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,000
See our barb-a-cuties?

848
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,200
Skewering rod
raring to go.

849
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,300
Well, are we ready?

850
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,100
I said, are we ready?

851
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,900
One, two, three.

852
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,400
Ramming speed!

853
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,400
Looky-loo.

854
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,300
It's Ricky on a sticky.

855
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,400
I love my meat
pink in the middle.

856
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,500
Take him to
the slaughter house, boys.

857
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:04,100
Good job, gals.

858
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,400
They were actually licking pie
off each other's tits.

859
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:16,500
I-it was so wrong, bro,
but so right.

860
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,800
Southern style.

861
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,500
Corndog, you have done it.
You are the man.

862
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,900
The man?

863
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,500
After taking 20 years
to get your first piece of ass?

864
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,100
Whatever.

865
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,000
Think this is
all fun and games?

866
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Look around you.

867
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,800
This place is fucked.

868
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,500
I mean, you don't get
something for nothing.

869
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,900
When was the last time
you been somewhere...

870
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,000
where there's
no electricity...

871
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,500
water... cable...

872
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,600
hot black bitches?

873
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,100
Malcolm's right.

874
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,200
This place is fucked.

875
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,700
I just ran
into Miss Peaches.

876
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,700
She was wearing
Kat's dog tag.

877
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,600
Said she gave it to her.

878
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,300
Kat would never
give this away.

879
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,900
And she wouldn't
stay gone this long...

880
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,400
without coming back
to check in.

881
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,200
It's not like Nelson vanished
with all this free beer around.

882
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,700
Wait a minute. You went off
with Leah, right?

883
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,400
Well, where is she now?

884
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,300
Square dancing and
guest starring on "Hee Haw."

885
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,900
Look, bottom line...
this is all bullshit.

886
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,800
I'm tired of being
the guest of honor.

887
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,000
She's right.

888
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I say we watch
each other's backs.

889
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,900
We're in this
together, right?

890
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,200
You got it, bro.

891
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,500
We tight
till we all hit the road.

892
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,400
Good.

893
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,100
I'll go check out
the ride situation.

894
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,300
Malcolm,
you go find Leah.

895
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,400
You two head back
to the hotels.

896
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,800
Get whatever stuff
they haven't ripped off.

897
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,700
Now everybody act like
this is all great here, OK?

898
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,400
We fucking love it.

899
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,000
Nobody let on
that we're gonna bail.

900
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,500
- Uh-huh.
- Heard that.

901
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,100
Miss Peaches says
y'all might be inclining...

902
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,700
to leave town.

903
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,600
Is that so?

904
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,800
Uh-oh.

905
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,500
Y'all don't
want us thinking...

906
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,900
that you're insulting
our heritage, now, do you?

907
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,800
Of course not.

908
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,600
We're thrilled to be here.

909
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,500
Yeah. That's right.

910
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,400
So, you guys
just excuse us.

911
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,600
Shit.

912
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,100
Sweet blade, ain't it?

913
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,500
Mmm.
Pretty piece of steel.

914
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,300
Now...

915
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:29,700
I'm only gonna say it
one time.

916
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:35,400
This is the most important
day of the year...

917
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,000
for the good citizens
of Pleasant Valley.

918
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:43,700
So, y'all don't want
to disappoint my kinfolk.

919
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,400
Trust me on that.

920
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,900
Yeah, we don't take
too well to rejection.

921
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:57,000
We've been known to react
harshly to them that crosses us.

922
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,100
I guess you're right,
Mr. Mayor.

923
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,500
I guess we shouldn't
be so fast to...

924
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,100
leave your fine festival.

925
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,500
Well...

926
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,000
that's right polite,
Mr. Lee.

927
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,100
Right polite.

928
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,600
So, y'all best be,
uh, going, huh?

929
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,900
You don't want
to miss the barbecue.

930
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,000
What do you think
happened to Nelson?

931
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,400
Nothing happened
to Nelson.

932
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,400
There's a simple explanation
for all of this.

933
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,700
Don't worry, bro.

934
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,400
I always said the South
ain't changed a damn.

935
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,300
Leah'd get mad at me
for saying that.

936
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,600
You know,
Kat, Ricky, and me.

937
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,600
We've done some pretty
freaky things in the past...

938
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,000
but nothing beats this.

939
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,100
All for a free meal.

940
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,400
Ain't this a bitch?

941
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,600
Pleasant Valley.

942
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,800
Hmm. More like
Death Valley.

943
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,100
OK, kids.

944
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,000
One hour. We'll regroup
at the hotel.

945
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,500
Well, all righty, then.

946
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,900
I'll be seeing y'all
at the barbecue tonight.

947
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,300
Don't be late.

948
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,300
Like he said, baby...

949
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,000
don't be late.

950
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,400
Later, bro.

951
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,200
Folks.

952
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,200
I'd like to propose a toast.

953
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,200
To us.

954
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:44,100
Survivors in
a spiritual sense...

955
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,100
of the worst atrocity
of our times.

956
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,300
A war between the states.

957
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:03,400
I know you fine people
of Pleasant Valley...

958
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,800
have suffered
more than seems possible.

959
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,600
But one day... one day
we will find rest...

960
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,900
we will find peace...

961
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,800
we will...
we will be avenged.

962
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,400
And I tell you now...

963
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:25,700
each and every one of
you sad, searching souls,

964
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,200
as God is my witness...

965
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,500
we will never...
never go hungry again.

966
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,300
Hey, precious.

967
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,800
What you doing there?

968
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,900
What the hell... Aw, shit.

969
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,700
They all nasty.

970
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,300
He's got our stuff.

971
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,100
Heads up.

972
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,000
Remind me to thank you later.

973
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,600
At the beach house?

974
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,500
On the beach.

975
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,100
So I left my cell phone
in my room.

976
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,100
Maybe they
haven't found it yet.

977
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,200
Go for it.

978
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,300
I'll stand guard.

979
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,300
Ricky.

980
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,500
Where you going, man?

981
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,500
Yo. Ricky.

982
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,200
Not this shit again.

983
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,200
There are lessons
in this world

984
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,100
Some are easy

985
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,600
Some are hard

986
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,500
To swallow, that is

987
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,700
Fuck this.

988
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,600
I don't even like
crackers in my soup.

989
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,200
Ah, the guest of honor.

990
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,800
We ain't expecting you till later.

991
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:56,900
Oh.

992
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,400
You wouldn't happen
to see where...

993
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,200
my friend went
through here, did you?

994
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,200
No, I ain't seen
nobody come through here.

995
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,400
You see anyone
come through here?

996
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,400
No, sir. Ain't seen nobody
come through here, sir.

997
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,700
Nobody except us mice.

998
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,300
It ain't polite to go sneaking
'round a kitchen before dinner.

999
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,800
Even if you is
the guest of honor.

1000
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,300
I'm sorry.

1001
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:21,600
I was just going to get
my best suit in my car.

1002
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:25,500
I would hate to show up
at the festival underdressed.

1003
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,000
You wouldn't know where
the cars are parked, would you?

1004
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,800
Oh, oh.
They parked them things...

1005
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,400
out by the barn.
Ain't that right?

1006
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,400
Oh, yes, sir.

1007
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,900
Your car, sir,
is parked right down yonder...

1008
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,500
by that there barn.

1009
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,200
Well, thank you kindly,
gentlemen.

1010
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,400
I'll be seeing y'all
at the barbecue.

1011
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,400
Oh, we'll be seeing you,
all right.

1012
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,100
There once was a lassie

1013
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,800
Slant-eyed, kind of sassy

1014
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,500
Airs and conceit

1015
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,500
Till Granny she did meet

1016
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,700
Shut up!

1017
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,400
Now, listen...

1018
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,900
Tired of this shit.

1019
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:09,300
Either one of you
inbred country fucks...

1020
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,700
knows where
my woman is...

1021
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,100
better tell me now.

1022
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,700
The boy wants his bitch

1023
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,000
Yeah, the boy wants his bitch

1024
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,600
Sad, sad thing

1025
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:22,700
A boy without his bitch

1026
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,900
Well, it's about time, Leah.

1027
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,100
Talk about a sight
for sore eyes.

1028
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,600
Hey, babe,
where you going?

1029
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,500
I don't get it. Hold on!

1030
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,900
Hey, Leah!

1031
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,600
Baby! Hold up!

1032
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:07,600
Oh, my God. No.

1033
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,600
Look what...

1034
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,700
Come on!

1035
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,500
Cory.

1036
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,700
Mmm. You looking for this?

1037
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,900
Well, here you go.

1038
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,500
OK, you win.

1039
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:25,700
Time to go home. Come on.

1040
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:29,400
What the fuck?

1041
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,400
What kind of people are you?

1042
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,900
Now, now, now, wait
a cotton-picking minute here.

1043
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,300
We thought you...
y'all liked games.

1044
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,100
Games?

1045
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,300
What kind of motherfucking
game is this?

1046
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,200
You Northerners
may be used...

1047
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,500
to uptight ladies
like Miss Joey.

1048
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,800
One country fuck, and all those
city girls will seem like...

1049
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:54,200
nothing more than
a hole in your mattress.

1050
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,300
What are you doing, huh?

1051
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,000
Putting in
your retainer, baby?

1052
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,400
You could call it that.

1053
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,300
Help!

1054
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,500
What the fuck?

1055
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,600
Well.

1056
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,900
Let's see, now. We...

1057
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,400
we done took him in...

1058
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:03,000
clothed you, fed you...

1059
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:06,400
give you a place to call home...

1060
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:10,000
and what'd you do
to repay our gratitude, hmm?

1061
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,100
You done run away.

1062
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,800
Motherfuckers!

1063
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:19,600
Need to wake up and
smell the 21st Century!

1064
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,800
Seems we have
to impress upon him...

1065
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,600
some good manners!

1066
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:41,300
Got any last requests, boy?

1067
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:45,100
Kiss my black ass.

1068
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:17,800
Next year,
no more last requests.

1069
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:28,400
Well, ding-dang-do.

1070
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,600
I believe you're trying to steal
that colored boy's bike.

1071
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,500
Oh, I wasn't stealing, buddy.

1072
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,400
I was just borrowing it.

1073
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,900
What are you doing
with the keys to that bad boy?

1074
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,400
Well, I reckon to take
a little ride myself.

1075
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,800
Granny done said I can't...

1076
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,700
on account I gotta guard
the barn all day.

1077
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,600
Dumb old ugly bitch.

1078
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,600
So, uh, what do you say,
you and l...

1079
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,900
We go for a ride.

1080
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,500
We'll find my buddies.
We'll play Kill the Kitty.

1081
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,500
You mean it?

1082
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:58,500
Sure, just toss me the keys
and we'll be on our way.

1083
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,500
Shoot.
If I go for a ride with you...

1084
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,300
how in the heck am I
supposed to guard the barn?

1085
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,600
Well, I won't tell Granny
if you won't.

1086
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,700
What do you say?

1087
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I say shoot, doggie.

1088
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,400
Huh?

1089
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,200
Ring the dinner bell.

1090
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,900
It's killing time.

1091
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:21,900
You really don't think
I'm that much of a moron, do you?

1092
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,600
Well, well.

1093
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,700
Just in time
for our grand finale.

1094
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,900
Year after year after year...

1095
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,700
it all comes down to this.

1096
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:51,300
Don't it, Granny?

1097
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,800
That it does, Bucky.

1098
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,800
Too bad his little friends
couldn't make it.

1099
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,500
Well, that's a matter of opinion.

1100
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:11,200
Ain't it just like
you Northern folk...

1101
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,400
thinking you can waltz
in here and bring us low.

1102
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:20,800
There ain't gonna be no escaping
what y'all got coming to you.

1103
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:21,900
So...

1104
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:26,300
who is going
to speak our gratitude?

1105
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,600
Our grace for
what sustains us? Hmm?

1106
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:35,000
My sweet Hucklebilly...

1107
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,500
will you do the honor?

1108
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,300
To our guests from the North...

1109
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,700
spread here at our feet...

1110
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,500
thanks for being such tasty meat!

1111
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:53,000
The South's going to rise again

1112
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:00,100
The South's going to rise again

1113
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,900
Now, you two
gonna be impressed...

1114
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:12,400
when you see the barbecue
Granny's done cooked up for you.

1115
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,900
Missy,
bet you can't eat just one.

1116
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,700
Now, y'all like
dark meat, hmm?

1117
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:40,100
Now, you might
be surprised...

1118
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:43,900
but I have always been
partial to Chinese.

1119
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,800
Only problem is...

1120
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:54,400
hour later, I'm still hungry!

1121
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,700
The South will rise

1122
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,500
The South will rise

1123
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,900
The South is gonna
rise again

1124
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,500
The South will rise

1125
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,200
The South will rise

1126
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,500
The South is gonna
rise again

1127
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:18,200
The South will rise!
The South will rise!

1128
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,800
The South will rise!
The South will rise!

1129
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:27,600
The South is gonna rise again!

1130
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:30,900
The South will rise!
The South will rise!

1131
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,700
The South is gonna rise again!

1132
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,800
We was gonna
go easy on you, boy!

1133
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,700
Being you was a fellow reb...
once, at least.

1134
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,500
But then little missy
done went and turned you.

1135
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,900
Now, being that
I'm a Southern gentleman...

1136
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,600
I'm gonna offer you
a second chance.

1137
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:59,200
All you got to do
is gut the whore!

1138
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,000
Well, what's it gonna be, boy?

1139
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,200
What's it gonna be, son?

1140
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:18,900
No time like the present.

1141
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,600
Here you go.

1142
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,200
It's just like guttin'
a possum, honey.

1143
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,700
Welcome back, son.

1144
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,000
To the glory...

1145
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,200
And the honor.

1146
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,700
Kill her. Kill her...

1147
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,900
I'll take
your glory and honor.

1148
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,600
And I'll shove it
right up your ass.

1149
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,600
You OK?

1150
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,500
Fuck those maniacs!

1151
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,900
Guess that means yes.

1152
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,600
Go get that Yankee traitor!

1153
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,000
Where the fuck
did she come from?

1154
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:40,100
You'll never kill me again.

1155
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,200
They're everywhere!

1156
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,600
I thought we'd found a way
to put yourself up to death.

1157
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,400
Think nothing right?

1158
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,400
Vengeance is mine,
sayeth the Lord.

1159
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:56,000
Down into the fiery pits
of hell with you.

1160
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,700
It burns. Burn, thy sins
and the sins of thy father.

1161
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:02,800
No, they did this!
Bring back my baby!

1162
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:13,500
Y'all stand back.

1163
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:16,700
They're mine now.

1164
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,400
Yee-haw!

1165
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:33,100
Let me go!

1166
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,100
This ain't my first barbecue, son!

1167
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:44,300
And it surely won't be my last.

1168
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,200
Duel of honor.

1169
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,300
Man to man.

1170
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:56,500
Yee-haw!

1171
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,400
Anderson!

1172
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:21,500
Please, son!

1173
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,100
L... I beg of you!

1174
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,600
N-not my good eye!

1175
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,400
I'll do it. I swear I'll do it.

1176
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,000
You'll be whistling "Dixie"
out of your eye socket...

1177
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,100
unless you let us go.

1178
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,300
Oh, we'll let you go!

1179
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:35,300
I swear it!

1180
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,200
W-word of honor!

1181
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,600
Word of honor?

1182
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,900
Southerner to Southerner.

1183
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,600
Gentleman to gentleman.

1184
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Word of honor.

1185
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,500
Let 'em go. Both of 'em.

1186
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,000
Set 'em free.

1187
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:10,600
Come on, boy. Take a ride.

1188
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,100
Only one way out, Mr. Lee.

1189
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:16,300
Right this way!

1190
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,200
Are you with me?

1191
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:24,400
All the way.

1192
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,800
Charge!

1193
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:51,700
An eye for an eye.

1194
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,800
Hey, hey, hey!

1195
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,700
What's your problem, boy,
charging in like that?

1196
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:25,900
Look, you gotta help us.

1197
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:29,200
I know it's crazy, OK...

1198
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:30,400
but the people
at Pleasant Valley...

1199
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,300
they put this detour sign
in the road...

1200
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:33,500
they killed our friends.

1201
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:37,100
They barbecued them
and fucking ate our friends.

1202
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:39,100
What in God's name
are you talking about?

1203
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,500
And then they...

1204
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:43,200
and then they started
killing us, one by one.

1205
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,300
Pleasant Valley, you say?

1206
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,500
Yeah. Yeah, you know
Pleasant Valley, right?

1207
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:47,700
Yeah, I know it, all right.

1208
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,400
Everything OK?

1209
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,300
I think you and me
need to take a little ride.

1210
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:59,300
Ought to lock you both up
for wasting my precious time.

1211
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,500
This here's your Pleasant Valley.

1212
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:05,300
Ain't nothing but a graveyard
been here for the last 150 years.

1213
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:08,500
No. There was a town here.

1214
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:09,700
Full of people.

1215
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:11,900
- We saw them.
- Lf I had a dollar...

1216
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,600
for every drunken college kid come
hollering about flesh-eating ghouls...

1217
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:15,800
I could have retired years...

1218
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,900
No, you're full of shit!

1219
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,100
- Hey! Hey!
- All right, all right,

1220
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:19,600
Stop, stop, stop.

1221
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,700
We're sorry.

1222
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,900
It was... it was a joke.

1223
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,400
Right?

1224
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:32,800
I guess the poor souls
of these fine people...

1225
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,000
who died at the hands
of you Northern heathens...

1226
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:37,000
ain't so partial to your joke.

1227
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,900
It's called respect, son.

1228
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:57,300
"To 2,001 innocent Confederate
citizens of Pleasant Valley...

1229
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:00,700
"laid to waste on this very spot
by renegade Yanks...

1230
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,300
"in the War
Between the States.

1231
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:05,300
"An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.

1232
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:09,500
"Never will they rest until,
one for one, they are avenged."

1233
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,300
It's dated April 22.

1234
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,700
That's today.

1235
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,100
But they're all dead.

1236
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:36,100
Fuck you, Pleasant Valley.

1237
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,800
Eye for an eye, Mr. Lee.

1238
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:47,400
Eye for an eye.

1239
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,600
Damn Yankees.

1240
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:42,800
