00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,592
40-50,000 lives a year could be
saved in the US alone, Doctor.

177

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,558
And more worldwide,
if properly marketed.

179

180
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,554
It could be
more complicated than drugs.

181
00:13:56,554 --> 00:13:56,680
 

182
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,638
It could be the proof,
perhaps, of the soul.

183
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:00,040
 

184
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,838
Come on, Schoonie,
where is the location of the soul?

185
00:14:02,838 --> 00:14:02,960
 

186
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,428
Under the hood? Next to the battery?

187

188
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,791
No, the soul begins
and ends with the brain.

189
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:08,920
 

190
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,151

192
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,431
We don't have anything that can put
somebody in, then back out, of death.

230
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,998
500 patients, three doctors, 15 nurses.

Her brother identified her

Don't worry, they never
bury them deep here.

869
00:48:57,591 --> 00:48:57,720
 

870
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,393
That is why I use this place.

871
00:49:00,393 --> 00:49:03,480
 

872
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,871

- No, no, this is not a child.

873
00:49:07,871 --> 00:49:09,000
 

874

876
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,828
A real prize, this one.

877
00:49:21,828 --> 00:49:22,480
 

878
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,436
A sorceress.

879
00:49:24,436 --> 00:49:25,440
 

880
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,874
When she lived, she had great power.

881
00:49:27,874 --> 00:49:29,680
 

882
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,036
Now... she is just easier to carry.

883
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:43,760
 

884
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,716
Dennis?

885
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:49,120
 

886
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,918
- It stinks.
- We will start tomorrow night.

887
00:49:51,918 --> 00:49:52,040
 

888
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,759
- Now, we get out of here.
- Let's go.

890
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,233
I think I still have
some of my father's old shirts.

891

892
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,079

- This shirt's fine.

910
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,116
Do you like it?

911
00:51:04,116 --> 00:51:06,840
 

912

Your pretty white face?

914
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,193
I asked you a question.

915
00:51:13,193 --> 00:51:15,560
 

916

920
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,715
I leave the face.

921
00:51:36,715 --> 00:51:43,160
 

922
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,116
You made your point.

923
00:51:45,116 --> 00:51:46,720
 

924
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,029

928
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,996
You were warned.

930
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,556
I warned you.

932
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,992
I'm a US citizen. Think about that.

934
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,557
I don't see the ambassador here.
Do you?

936
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,675
I'm in medical research.

938
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,270
There's a lot of money in it.
There's plenty for you.

939

940

954
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,710
Not good enough.

A little pain, a little terror.

20 minutes later they were dead.

1164

1172

only certain areas of the brain.

Something's wrong. I can feel it.

There's a door to the mystical,
and you've just walked through it.

Right now, you are very vulnerable.
I wouldn't go back to Haiti now.

1244
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:49,553
You'd be a grade-school boy
in a world of Nobel Prize winners.

1245

1246
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,672
I'd stay as far away
from Haiti as I could.
