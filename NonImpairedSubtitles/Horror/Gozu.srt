1
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,102
Hello! Hello!

2
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,846
Brother, Boss is here.

3
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,424
Welcome.

4
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,858
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for coming.

5
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,084
Let's start.

6
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:13,261
Now, if anyone has any news
to report, please do so.

7
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,067
Anything?

8
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:25,502
Haven't you got any?

9
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,424
Since there seems to be no news...

10
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,261
Hey, the chick you were with the
other day, with those huge...

11
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,662
No, no...
- Did you do her?

12
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,963
No, no.

13
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,626
My, my... you stupid fool!

14
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:52,401
If no one has any announcement,
let me proceed with updates.

15
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,169
What?

16
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:03,078
What I'm about to tell you is all a
joke, so please don't take it seriously.

17
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,490
Did you see the dog outside?

18
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,217
The dog?

19
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:17,923
The dog.

20
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,012
Please don't stare.

21
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:48,686
That must be a yakuza dog trained
to only attack only yakuza.

22
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,892
A yakuza dog?

23
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,863
A yakuza dog.

24
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,668
That?

25
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,438
We all need to be careful.

26
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,550
No one seems to have any
announcement to make...

27
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,445
So let's move on to greetings from Boss.

28
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:23,463
Yeah, well, I really don't have
a lot to say this month but...

29
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,760
Boss!

30
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,464
Gotta kill it before it kills us.

31
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,121
The Great Yakuza Horror Theatre
GOZU

32
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,240
Are we there yet?

33
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,187
Just a little longer.

34
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,626
Did Boss tell you anything?

35
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,027
About what?

36
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,133
About this trip to Nagoya to see clients.

37
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,997
Isn't it strange?

38
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,705
To have me visit clients at such a time?

39
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:36,878
Um, can I go take a leak? Excuse me.

40
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,469
Minami.

41
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,699
Yes.

42
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,703
What do you think of our family?

43
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,177
I think it's a good family.

44
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:11,583
Our family will continue to
decline if this keeps up...

45
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,087
As long as Boss is in charge.

46
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,326
It will be fine as long as we
have you, Brother Ozaki.

47
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:27,306
All Boss cares about now is the woman.

48
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,175
It's hopeless when one falls
for a woman at that age.

49
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:40,983
I'm planning to ask him to retire.

50
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:49,426
Depending on how it goes, I
might kill him and get killed.

51
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:59,665
Will you put your trust in me
and stick with me to the end?

52
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:12,212
Brother, I've been ready for this
since when you saved my life.

53
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:18,519
I'll stick with you to the end no matter what.

54
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,134
Bad news...

55
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,510
Stop the car!

56
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,126
Minami, get out! Get out!

57
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,525
Yes!

58
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,764
Down! Down!

59
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,061
Wh... what is it?

60
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:45,100
That's a yakuza car designed
to... run over yakuza.

61
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:06,990
Brother, it doesn't look like
anything but a regular car.

62
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:11,161
Plus, there's no such thing as a yakuza car.

63
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,475
Minami...

64
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:35,018
If anything happens to me,
please take care of my things.

65
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,262
Die.

66
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:15,964
Brother!

67
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,135
Go now.

68
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,478
Go now!

69
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,622
Brother... Brother!

70
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,326
Yes, it's Minami.

71
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,130
Where are you?

72
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,703
Just before Nagoya.

73
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,539
You're late. And Ozaki?

74
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,409
He's asleep.

75
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,883
That's convenient. Hurry on.

76
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,916
You aren't still hesitating, are you?

77
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,782
I'm telling you Ozaki is crazy.

78
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,527
Hurry and take him to the
disposal site in Nagoya.

79
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,727
Understood?

80
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,533
Understood.

81
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:37,143
1 km to Nagoya

82
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,230
Brother...

83
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:31,795
Brother? Brother?

84
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:27,101
Well, it's more cold today.

85
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,440
It was warmer yesterday.

86
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,842
It's definitely colder today!

87
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:39,343
What, you don't believe me...
you stupid idiot!

88
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,512
I said it's cold!

89
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:47,225
Hold on! It's going to beep, so let me
put in another coin. Hold on a second.

90
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,929
Welcome.

91
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:05,938
Yeah, sure it was super hot
until the day before yesterday...

92
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:06,979
Coffee.

93
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,209
...I was walkin' 'round in short sleeves.

94
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,475
You don't believe me?

95
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,115
Everyone agrees.

96
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,515
It was hot, right?

97
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:19,049
Look, everyone says yeah...

98
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:26,997
Walkin' 'round in short sleeves.
You don't believe me?

99
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,835
Everyone agrees.
It was hot, right?

100
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:35,164
Look, everyone says yeah...

101
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,844
Here you are.

102
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,295
I only ordered coffee.

103
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,064
It's on the house.

104
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,632
Enjoy.

105
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,903
What?

106
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:24,279
You're not from Nagoya, are you?

107
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:30,550
Not from Nagoya, are you?

108
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,254
Not from Nagoya?

109
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,402
Not from Nagoya, are you?

110
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,494
Hey!

111
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,357
It was hot, he goes.

112
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,960
I go it was.

113
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:22,466
I go it was hot, and he goes ''Spot''.

114
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,242
He said that?

115
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,540
Doesn't make sense at all!

116
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,746
What a strange one!

117
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:33,118
Really. Strange, you know.

118
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:38,021
Then it goes ''beep'', I go
I'm running out of coins...

119
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:52,420
Excuse me, did someone come in?

120
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,263
Who do you mean by someone?

121
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:59,663
Someone came in while I
was in the bathroom, right?

122
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,305
Did anyone just come in?

123
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,212
Well...
- Did someone?

124
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,347
No. We don't know, right?

125
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:12,214
Did someone?
- Well, ready to go?

126
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,262
I don't understand what
you're saying, you idiot!

127
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,737
You killed Ozaki for sure, right?

128
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:38,973
Then there's no way dead Ozaki goes
anywhere by himself, is there? Idiot.

129
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:42,641
What're we gonna do if he's alive?

130
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:47,382
He even wants to take my life!

131
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:55,851
Anyhow, just find his dead body or whatever
and bring it to the yakuza disposal site!

132
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,588
Understood?

133
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:00,993
Ouch!

134
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,001
The ladle's rubbing against me. Ouch!

135
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:07,062
It hurts, hurts!! Ouch!

136
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,358
Are you near Nagoya now?

137
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,260
Yes. Close.

138
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:33,095
There's someone I know who's headed a
family for a long time called Shiroyama Group.

139
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,501
That's the ''Shi-ro-ya-ma'' Group.

140
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:40,494
Go to him. He might help you.

141
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,147
Sure, the address is around here.

142
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:00,121
But I've never heard of the Shiroyama Group.

143
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,659
I was told they lived here for a long time.

144
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,556
Then they may have gone somewhere else.

145
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,494
But... you mean if they've gone somewhere...

146
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,641
Why don't you ask the police?

147
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,117
That's your best bet.

148
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,401
What is it?

149
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,516
What is it?

150
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,683
Where's the Shiroyama Group located?

151
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,688
Shiroyama Group?

152
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,763
What's the address?

153
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:26,937
This address is where Shin-ho Farm is.

154
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,410
What?

155
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:32,615
But... the man at the temple
said he didn't know where.

156
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,714
You're not from Nagoya, are you?

157
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,321
Tokyo?

158
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,390
Yokohama?

159
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,057
I'm from Hong Kong.

160
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,771
What does the Shiroyama Group do?

161
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,808
Thanks but I'll find it myself.

162
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,246
Out of the range...

163
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,352
It's a bone.

164
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,563
It was a bone as I suspected, a bone.

165
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:12,933
You got a flat tire.

166
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,444
Need a hand?

167
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,108
Does my face bother you?

168
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:38,065
Stare at it all you want. I hate it
when people pretend it's not there.

169
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:51,510
I was born with a pigment
defect just around here.

170
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:09,794
Is it creepy?

171
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:13,969
Not really...

172
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:25,783
My factory carries lots of tires.

173
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,846
I'm sure there's one that fits your car.

174
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:33,021
We all need to help one another, you know.

175
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,238
Can you sing ''Yosaku''?

176
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,236
No.

177
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,889
Have you ever killed a man?

178
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,757
No.

179
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:15,495
I see.

180
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:27,073
I bet you eat curry over rice and hashed
meat over rice together, don't you?

181
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:28,839
No.

182
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:38,188
Hey, your grandma's name is Kiriko, right?

183
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,125
It's Keiko.

184
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:46,758
Keiko...

185
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:55,931
Wait a minute... hey, what're
you trying to find out?

186
00:32:56,507 --> 00:33:02,309
Well, I thought we're much alike, you and me.

187
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:53,323
Shiro... yama... Group...

188
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:17,581
Hmm, that man named Mr.
Azamawari doesn't quite ring a bell.

189
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,394
Hey, do you know him?

190
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,589
No, I don't know him.

191
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:34,101
Your ''brother'' that disappeared, is
he someone that important to you?

192
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,234
Yes.

193
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:40,340
Then I might lend you a helping hand.

194
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,272
We all need to help one another, you know.

195
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,547
On one condition, however.

196
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:56,421
If you can answer the question I'm about
to ask, I'll help you find your brother.

197
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:04,160
But if you can't answer, I won't help you,
plus I'll take something important to you.

198
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,134
I got no money if that's what you mean.

199
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,139
Is money what's important to you?

200
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:15,236
My life?

201
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,239
That's not what I want.

202
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:24,586
I'm just gonna take something
that's extremely important to you.

203
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:28,854
Do you wanna give it a shot?

204
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:41,767
I do.

205
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,370
Alright.

206
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:50,576
Then here's the question.

207
00:35:54,018 --> 00:36:00,253
What passes by, though it's not moving?

208
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,253
I'll give you 30 seconds.

209
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:10,001
30...29...28...27...26...

210
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:16,774
25...24...23...22...21...

211
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:20,745
20...1 1... 10 seconds remaining.

212
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:24,015
You skipped some. Hey, you skipped! Skipped!

213
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,016
I didn't skip.

214
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,084
That's not...not enough time like this!

215
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:33,191
5...4...3...2...1...

216
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,783
Wait... Time!

217
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,388
It's time that passes by!

218
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:38,822
...0.

219
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:41,465
You got it!

220
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,057
Congratulations!

221
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:56,708
As promised, I'll help you find your brother.

222
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,378
No'se, help him.
- Yes, I will.

223
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:06,655
He knows this area... at least most of it.

224
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,291
Thank you.

225
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:18,436
The sun's going down soon so we'll
commence our investigation tomorrow.

226
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:22,673
No, that won't work. I'm in a hurry.

227
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:27,269
We're the ones helping you out and
we expect you to go by our schedule.

228
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,238
If you don't like it, please
go ahead on your own.

229
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:35,381
Haste makes waste.

230
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:54,535
Masakazu Inn

231
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:13,618
Let's go.

232
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:24,834
Hello.

233
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,436
Hello?

234
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,077
Hello!

235
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,450
Hello!!

236
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,364
Hello?

237
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,172
Welcome.

238
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:15,349
I'm sorry, I was digging up
some lotus root in the field.

239
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,189
Need a room?

240
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,157
Is there a vacancy?

241
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,953
A double room?

242
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,564
Single, please.

243
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:33,327
There's only one small room available.

244
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,764
You're okay with that,
right? That's fine, please.

245
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,640
Kazuo!! A guest.

246
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:14,643
Rustic cuisine or seasonal
Masakazu Inn

247
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,573
Show him to the room.

248
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,179
Which room?

249
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,153
That room!

250
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:38,124
Please come in.

251
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,708
Well, thank you for everything today.

252
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,645
I'll see you tomorrow.

253
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,613
No, I'll be fine.

254
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:56,581
Well, I need to see what kind of room it is.

255
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:58,821
I'm concerned.

256
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:16,001
Would you like dinner?

257
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:20,707
Yes, please.

258
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:25,913
Well...

259
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:32,249
Let me consult the owner.

260
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,298
It's a pretty good room.

261
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,593
Yeah.

262
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,897
I could stay here, too...

263
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,129
Do you mind?

264
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:52,067
Well, you'll see me tomorrow.

265
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:56,879
Aren't you cold-hearted.
After I did so much for you.

266
00:41:57,314 --> 00:42:00,283
I...I do appreciate it.

267
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,954
I just can't sleep well with
somebody else in the room.

268
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,090
I won't do anything weird to you.

269
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,318
Well...

270
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:11,090
That's not the issue...

271
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:13,696
I really can't?

272
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:15,792
I'm sorry...

273
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:17,964
I see.

274
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,165
I'll go home.

275
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,665
That's what you want, right?

276
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:28,277
Who do you think you are? Idiot.

277
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:38,887
Did your friend leave?

278
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:41,986
Yes.

279
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:46,660
Are you having a meal?

280
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:49,861
Oh, if you don't serve food,
I can go outside to eat.

281
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:53,998
Oh no, we can prepare it.

282
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:59,039
We just don't have many ingredients today.

283
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:08,252
Normally, we can prepare Course A, but
we can only prepare Course B today.

284
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,854
Is that alright with you?

285
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:13,084
That Course B is fine.

286
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,626
Yes, we'll prepare it then.

287
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:29,996
Oh, sir, it'll be a while before
the dinner will be ready.

288
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:33,435
Would you like to take a bath first?

289
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,169
Then I'll do that.

290
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:40,647
Oh, it's down the hall to
the end and you turn left.

291
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:46,286
Well, we have this beautiful gum tree, and...

292
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:24,290
How's the water temperature?

293
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:26,660
It's fine.

294
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,663
I see.

295
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:38,036
What is it?

296
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,710
Shall I scrub your back?

297
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,375
No thanks.

298
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,045
Really?

299
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:52,582
No, it's okay! I can do it myself!

300
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:57,925
Lately, I've been getting many
guests who turns me down like that.

301
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,097
Please hand me your towel.

302
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,792
It's okay.

303
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:16,880
You don't have to hide yourself.

304
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,077
That's a big one you've got.

305
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:31,028
Aren't my breasts big?

306
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:32,256
What?

307
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:36,260
I still got milk, too.

308
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,094
Would you like to drink it?
- Huh?

309
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:13,533
No, of course, I won't drink that!

310
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:21,437
Lately I've been getting so many
guests who turns me down like that.

311
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,444
Here.

312
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,207
I don't want it.

313
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:27,584
Go ahead.

314
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,745
I said I don't want it!

315
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,591
It's just a joke.

316
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:48,293
The dinner is... is ready!

317
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:55,074
See you later.

318
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,390
Excuse me.

319
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,531
Hey, this here, why did you give me so much?

320
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,239
It's free service.

321
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,973
Even for free service...

322
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:10,482
No, wait...it's okay.

323
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,288
I can do it myself.

324
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,827
Excuse me.

325
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,021
Hey, Minami!

326
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,959
Did your phimosis operation go well?

327
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:34,964
Yes, it went okay.

328
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,074
Let me see it.

329
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:39,810
Huh? Oh, it's not much to see.

330
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,004
I said let me see it.

331
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,112
No, really...

332
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,273
Let me see it or I'll fuckin' kill you!

333
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:46,944
Okay...

334
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:49,579
Wait, just a second.

335
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,517
Here.

336
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:57,957
Oh, so that's what it looks like.

337
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:02,459
I guess.
- It looks like Frankenstein's dick, doesn't it?

338
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,660
But your cock's still great. Really impressive.

339
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:12,609
Well... Brother, can I...cover it now?

340
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:17,047
Yeah. So you can fuck women, at last. Right?

341
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,309
Yes.

342
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,712
I've got a gift for you.

343
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,214
What's this?

344
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:27,013
Women's undies.

345
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:29,553
Thank you.

346
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:33,762
Give them to the woman you wanna fuck.

347
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:35,091
Yes.

348
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:37,732
They're a good-luck charm, so you'll do fine.

349
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:41,136
They're Givenchy crotchless-panties.

350
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:45,142
Oh, thank you.
- That's quality stuff, so use them well.

351
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,476
It's Givenchy, you know.
- Yes, yes, I got it.

352
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:49,279
Alright? Don't you throw them away.
- I won't throw them away.

353
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:51,406
You let her wear them and fuck her in them.

354
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,017
In them?
- Fuck her with them on.

355
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:55,218
Fuck her with them on?

356
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,810
'Cause there's a hole in them.

357
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:01,613
Use them well.
- Got it. I'll use them well. Thanks.

358
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:48,060
We selected Course A for your breakfast.

359
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:33,746
Good morning.

360
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,451
What happened to you?

361
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,414
Can't you see? I got injured.

362
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:44,890
I had a feeling something bad
was gonna happen yesterday.

363
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:49,588
That's why I didn't wanna
go home. It's all your fault.

364
00:52:53,470 --> 00:53:00,034
I've got some tires for you, so
first let's go and change your tire.

365
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,329
When we're done with the
tires, where shall we go?

366
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,480
I see the coffee shop re-opened.

367
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:44,387
They'd gone out of business
and was abandoned before.

368
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:48,121
I see they re-opened.

369
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,102
Welcome.

370
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:37,333
They were here yesterday, too.

371
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,334
They look suspicious, don't they?

372
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:43,668
Ready to order?

373
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:49,151
Coffee. No custard, please.

374
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:52,646
Coffee for me, too. With custard.

375
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:54,621
Yes.

376
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,930
They might know something.

377
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:09,939
Don't know. I asked them yesterday
but they just kind of dodged me.

378
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,298
Let me go ask.

379
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:21,745
Excuse me, can I ask you a question?

380
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:30,360
Aren't you little No'se from West junior high?

381
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,394
What?

382
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:33,430
It's little No'se! It sure is!
- What?

383
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,865
What do you mean ''what?'',
you're little No'se!

384
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:36,866
It's little No'se!

385
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:38,768
Well, well, I recognized you right away!

386
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:40,736
Little No'se, have a seat!

387
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,063
It's been a long time...
- ...Little Komatsu and Little Shiro?

388
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:48,678
What on earth are you doing here?
- It's been a long time.

389
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:49,779
To run into you guys here...

390
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:52,282
Have a cup to drink with us.
- Oh, I ordered something over there...

391
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:54,117
That's alright, don't be shy.

392
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:56,642
Hey, bring...bring something for him over here!

393
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:58,714
You're sitting over there?

394
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:04,590
Oh, let us have Little No'se
for a little while, okay?

395
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:07,424
It's been a long time.

396
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,698
What happened to your head?
- I fell again.

397
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:16,906
Falling again. You were falling all
the time since you were little!

398
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:20,210
I can't move well since I fell.
- A disaster with this one!

399
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,804
Oh, you've got a cane.

400
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:28,147
I can barely get up and walk.
- Hey, come on, don't get up!

401
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,486
Let me ask you again about yesterday.

402
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,292
Who's this?

403
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:39,989
He's an acquaintance of sorts...

404
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:45,256
Yesterday while I was in the bathroom,
did you see another customer come in?

405
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,197
Do you remember anything?

406
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,033
No.

407
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:55,403
I can't understand a thing
about what you're saying.

408
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:01,143
I was here yesterday, right?

409
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:04,286
About what time?

410
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:06,884
You know I was here around noon.

411
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,520
I don't remember too well.

412
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:15,293
I remember even if you don't.

413
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:25,464
You're conspiring against me,
aren't you? Right? Conspiring.

414
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:28,144
You're tired.

415
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:28,178
What the fuck did you say, you bastard?
You're tired.

416
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:30,237
What the fuck did you say, you bastard?

417
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:35,718
Mr. Minami, hold on! Mr. Minami!

418
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:38,710
If you assault me like that,
I won't stay quiet, either!

419
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:43,793
Hold up!

420
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,852
I won't stay quiet!

421
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,329
Let's go, No'se.

422
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:57,240
Well, please go by yourself if you want.

423
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,798
What the hell are you saying?

424
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,904
You should hire an investigator
if you want to look for someone.

425
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:08,713
I never had any desire to help you anyway.

426
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,521
It was cold yesterday, wasn't it?

427
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:12,749
It was cold.

428
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:17,393
It was hot the day before, wasn't it?
- It was hot.

429
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:20,692
You wore short sleeves, didn't you?
- I did.

430
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:27,435
You see. I told you...

431
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:05,000
Wait out there. No'se

432
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:20,521
So you're looking for someone.

433
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,191
Go ahead.

434
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:25,555
Thanks.

435
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:31,123
And has there been any clue?

436
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:35,901
None.

437
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:40,299
I'm sorry.

438
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:51,649
Well, Mr. Minami...

439
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:54,113
Have you heard of psychics?

440
00:59:57,493 --> 01:00:00,792
Yeah, something like ESP, right?

441
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:04,090
Well, I guess there's something in common.

442
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:16,503
Actually, my brother Kazu over there
has always had this mysterious power.

443
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:22,577
He's a medium.

444
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:30,090
Did you say...a medium?

445
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,131
Yes.

446
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:56,909
He lets the spirit possess his body, and
the spirit speaks words through him.

447
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:09,129
The spirit may have an idea about the
whereabouts of the man you're looking for.

448
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:32,853
Would you like to ask?

449
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,528
Can he really do it?

450
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,634
I think it's worth trying.

451
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:52,998
Well, then...

452
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:11,886
So you're brother and sister...

453
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:36,986
Thanks for waiting.

454
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:40,149
Then, let's proceed.

455
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:46,219
Kazu, take your shirt off.

456
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:48,023
What?

457
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:51,633
You've always done this.

458
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:54,635
Come on, hurry up, take it off.

459
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:57,972
The candy drop, the candy here.

460
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:00,642
Come on, hurry up.

461
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:04,441
Hurry up and take it off.

462
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:25,659
Now, we'll invoke the spirit.

463
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:28,897
Please repeat this in your mind:

464
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:35,374
''De'an keru kemista amore. ''

465
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:36,837
What?

466
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:52,085
Can you read that once?

467
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:59,462
De'an keru kemista...amore.

468
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:04,133
Ah! That's fine!

469
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:13,010
Now let's begin. Kazu, are you ready?

470
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:32,232
Spirit, decend!

471
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:49,377
Spirit, appear!

472
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:51,749
Ouch! It hurts!

473
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:55,722
Spirit, appear!

474
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:09,538
It hurts, sister!

475
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:11,733
How's that? Has the spirit come down?

476
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:15,043
No such thing will ever appear!

477
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:18,342
Come down!

478
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:22,878
It hurts!

479
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,088
Please, please help me!

480
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,890
What...can you have the spirit appear?

481
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:30,059
No, I can't do that!

482
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:31,027
Get up!

483
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:33,763
Wait...your brother says he's not a medium!

484
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:38,200
Whether he can do it or not...is not the issue!

485
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:48,344
...She's crazy...

486
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:55,011
Even if he can't, managing to deliver somehow
is the spirit of service and motto of our inn!

487
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,848
There!

488
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:01,624
It hurts!
- You...

489
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,319
It hurts, sister!

490
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:05,958
Wait...

491
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:45,929
Mr. No'se.

492
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:49,368
Mr. Minami...

493
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:52,163
I'm scared...

494
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:55,605
...scared.
- What? What?

495
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:04,418
You saw the two at the coffee
shop, in silver and in gold.

496
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:06,049
Yes.

497
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:12,328
They were the gang leaders from junior high.

498
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:17,698
I was so scared I couldn't
say no. Please forgive me.

499
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:23,962
Well, I understand now. I see.

500
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:28,409
I'm scared, Mr. Minami.

501
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:33,681
I'm scared... scared...

502
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:37,887
Don't be so scared. You're an adult now, okay?

503
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,354
It's not that.

504
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:42,789
Not that...well, what do you mean?

505
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:57,198
You know ... the manager
... of the coffee shop.

506
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:00,202
Yes, at the shop back there, right?

507
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,875
He's been dead.

508
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:22,521
He died three years ago, in a car accident.

509
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:50,284
How come the dead guy's here?

510
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:54,451
You're asking the wrong person.

511
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:59,734
By the way, I've got breaking news.

512
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:05,534
Those two saw someone
who might be your brother.

513
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:07,402
Is that true?

514
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:10,675
You went to the bathroom, right?

515
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:20,880
While you were there, a man of about 40
wandered in, asking where to get sticky rice.

516
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,823
Sticky...rice?

517
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:29,798
The two told him he should
go to a rice shop for rice...

518
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:34,758
...and gave him the address for
the nearest rice shop. Here it is.

519
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:00,418
Sticky rice?

520
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:04,427
Yeah, I seem to remember someone
looking for that yesterday.

521
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:11,502
Did he look something like this?

522
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:20,609
Something like that.

523
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:27,012
Something like that.

524
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:32,817
What did he do after he bought sticky rice?

525
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:37,361
He asked if I carried sesame
seeds or azuki beans.

526
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,790
Sesame and azuki?

527
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:43,737
Unfortunately I'd run out of them...

528
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:48,141
But I told him perhaps they might
carry them at a liquor store.

529
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:52,113
Did he go to a liquor store?

530
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:54,175
Probably.

531
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:56,110
Which liquor store?

532
01:10:56,652 --> 01:11:00,349
I told him about the closest
liquor store around here.

533
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:01,884
Where is it?

534
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:08,387
Are you...going to the store?

535
01:11:08,564 --> 01:11:09,765
I think so.

536
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,995
I advise against it.

537
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:15,364
Why's that?

538
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:22,703
The wife of the store owner... is an American!

539
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:27,016
Is it bad if she's an American?

540
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:28,608
Of course it is!

541
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:35,319
The store's always only carried Japanese sake.

542
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:42,598
And it's hopeless 'cause the owner's wife
is now more Japanese than a Japanese!

543
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:46,125
'Cause an American selling
Japanese sake is wrong, isn't it!

544
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:53,336
Can you give me the address of the store?

545
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,515
Do you like Americans?

546
01:12:04,453 --> 01:12:06,978
I haven't seen him. Have you seen him?

547
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:13,662
Though I am not totally cer-tain, a man whom
I suspect is the person you de-scribed...

548
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:21,569
...ur, visited the store in the
evening and did indeed in-quire...

549
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:31,914
...to ask a question to query, ''Have you
got sesame seeds and azuki beans?''

550
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:33,814
Oh, so he came.

551
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:36,485
That's when I was out playing pachinko, was it?

552
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:42,191
Yes, just when you were out doing
pachinko, the customer visited and...

553
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:46,287
...he bought, ur, sesame and azukoo.

554
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:50,293
So, do you know where he went?

555
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:51,956
I do.

556
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:55,228
If you know, just tell them.

557
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:57,235
I'm sorry.

558
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:03,112
The man said to me to in-quire, ''Is
there a cheap inn around here?''

559
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:12,510
So I offered to tell him about the
inn that I happened to know about.

560
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:26,759
Which inn is it?

561
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:40,873
It's called Ma-sa-ka-zu inn, run by two siblings.

562
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:49,190
Thank you for coming!

563
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:15,699
Oh, it's you.

564
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:22,176
Have you found the man you were looking for?

565
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:34,124
Did you receive another customer
other than me last night?

566
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:44,665
Did you?

567
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:32,147
You don't have to yell.

568
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:38,754
Kazu...

569
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,863
What time was that about?

570
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:53,966
About...1 o'clock...at night, I think.

571
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,277
He was here?

572
01:16:56,845 --> 01:17:00,713
It was so late...

573
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:09,817
...so I refused him at first...

574
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:20,194
...but he said anywhere would do...

575
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:32,443
...so I ended up showing
him to the storage upstairs.

576
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:39,016
Room upstairs, you mean, over there?

577
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:46,292
It's the room right above yours.

578
01:17:49,698 --> 01:18:02,543
Those who deliver milk are
healthier than those who drink it.

579
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:14,243
Brother...

580
01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:17,842
It's his smell.

581
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:26,951
Where did he go?

582
01:19:27,896 --> 01:19:33,994
He seems to have left early in
the morning. Without paying.

583
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:39,340
We didn't know what to do, so we took his...

584
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:47,415
...sticky rice, sesame seeds and azuki beans...

585
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:54,085
...that he had left and made some red rice.

586
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:05,000
Can I sleep in this room tonight?

587
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,994
This isn't a room for guests.

588
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:26,078
The room you stayed in last night is
available, so why stay in a room like this?

589
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:29,246
'Cause my brother might come back.

590
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:39,961
We'll charge you the regular rate, is that okay?

591
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:38,182
Brother...

592
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:44,186
Brother?

593
01:26:34,088 --> 01:26:40,960
''I'll wait for you at the disposal site. Ozaki.''

594
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:52,328
Brother!

595
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,047
Hello!

596
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:43,454
Brother?

597
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:55,029
Brother!

598
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:58,235
Brother!

599
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:01,899
Brother!!

600
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:05,938
Brother!

601
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:36,802
Who do you want to dispose?

602
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:48,956
Didn't this man come here yesterday or today?

603
01:28:54,762 --> 01:28:56,093
He did.

604
01:28:58,366 --> 01:28:59,628
Really?

605
01:29:00,601 --> 01:29:02,193
Who do you want to dispose?

606
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:06,465
He was lying on the ground at the doorway.

607
01:29:07,475 --> 01:29:08,874
On the ground...

608
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:10,534
Someone brought him here, I guess.

609
01:29:12,313 --> 01:29:14,281
Where's that man now?

610
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:18,814
He's dead.

611
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:22,719
Who do you want to dispose?

612
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:25,517
We pressed him.

613
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:33,525
Did you kill my brother, you bastard?

614
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:37,193
Probably.

615
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:40,870
Put that away.

616
01:29:42,977 --> 01:29:47,676
What was inside is in here.

617
01:29:48,549 --> 01:29:49,982
Who do you want to dispose?

618
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:07,934
What patterns did he wear?

619
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:12,334
Oh, here it is.

620
01:30:24,152 --> 01:30:25,744
It's pretty good.

621
01:30:31,225 --> 01:30:33,659
This is your Brother.

622
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:35,889
This one right here!

623
01:31:15,169 --> 01:31:16,966
It took you long enough.

624
01:31:26,247 --> 01:31:29,683
I waited for you a long time, Mr Minami.

625
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,314
Who...?

626
01:31:34,522 --> 01:31:37,582
I'm Ozaki, your brother.

627
01:31:39,126 --> 01:31:41,253
Did you find this place right away?

628
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:45,629
Who the hell are you?

629
01:31:47,635 --> 01:31:49,296
You don't believe me, do you?

630
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:53,404
How can I? My brother's a man, you know!

631
01:31:55,376 --> 01:31:59,210
''Did your phimosis operation go well, Minami?''

632
01:32:01,916 --> 01:32:03,508
''Let me see it.''

633
01:32:05,786 --> 01:32:11,088
''Oh, so that's what it looks like
after a phimosis operation.''

634
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:15,093
''Looks like the Frankenstein's
cock, doesn't it?''

635
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:19,189
''But your thing is always large
and fine. Very impressive.''

636
01:32:23,237 --> 01:32:24,636
How's that?

637
01:32:31,312 --> 01:32:33,507
What do you think of my outfit?

638
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:39,680
Doesn't look good, does it?
- What?

639
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:43,888
I'll go and change, so please
wait for a little while.

640
01:32:58,873 --> 01:33:00,340
Wait a minute!

641
01:33:01,142 --> 01:33:02,370
What is it?

642
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:09,106
Are you surprised because I became pretty?

643
01:33:09,517 --> 01:33:13,214
Stop it already. Who the hell are you?

644
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:15,783
You still don't believe me.

645
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:17,652
Of course, I can't!

646
01:33:19,193 --> 01:33:21,593
What can I do to make you believe me?

647
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:24,762
How about...

648
01:33:29,036 --> 01:33:32,096
You are still a virgin.

649
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:39,877
You used a picture of mating dogs
the first time you masturbated.

650
01:33:40,381 --> 01:33:49,289
You get the urge from time to time
to shave all your pubic hair off.

651
01:33:50,424 --> 01:33:51,721
How do you know all those things?

652
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:55,094
You told me all those things.

653
01:33:57,365 --> 01:33:59,560
Brother Ozaki is the only person I told them to.

654
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:03,634
I'm telling you, I am Ozaki.

655
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:45,338
Brother's been disposed of properly.

656
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:48,806
Sorry for troubling your mind.

657
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:53,115
There's just one small problem that arose...

658
01:34:53,387 --> 01:34:56,754
No, Brother's been disposed fine.

659
01:34:59,427 --> 01:35:02,157
Yes... Well, it's kind of hard to explain.

660
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:04,921
Can I explain when I get back to the office?

661
01:35:05,599 --> 01:35:08,864
Yes. I'll be back by tomorrow morning.

662
01:35:09,970 --> 01:35:11,562
So long.

663
01:36:11,465 --> 01:36:13,023
Bastard!

664
01:36:13,901 --> 01:36:15,169
You still wanna do it?

665
01:36:15,169 --> 01:36:17,831
Alright! Alright!

666
01:36:31,218 --> 01:36:33,812
What are you doing going with that man!?

667
01:36:34,421 --> 01:36:36,116
'Cause he asked me.

668
01:36:40,194 --> 01:36:42,128
Aren't you my brother!?

669
01:37:09,156 --> 01:37:10,919
Sorry about this hotel.

670
01:37:14,061 --> 01:37:15,619
I apologize.

671
01:37:16,764 --> 01:37:18,629
I don't mind.

672
01:37:20,701 --> 01:37:29,040
We're leaving early tomorrow morning.
So, please rest...well.

673
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:38,350
Wouldn't you like to sleep with me here?

674
01:37:43,757 --> 01:37:47,420
I'm fine. I'll sleep here.

675
01:37:48,362 --> 01:37:49,727
Is that so.

676
01:37:56,570 --> 01:37:58,060
I'll turn out the light.

677
01:37:59,974 --> 01:38:01,566
Good night.

678
01:41:55,242 --> 01:41:58,006
Trying to do something nasty?

679
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:02,874
Excuse me! Excuse me!

680
01:42:05,886 --> 01:42:08,286
Wanna do something nasty?

681
01:42:15,362 --> 01:42:17,125
Please excuse me.

682
01:42:22,269 --> 01:42:27,400
If you feel like doing nasty,
you can wake me anytime.

683
01:43:36,944 --> 01:43:38,206
Thanks.

684
01:44:01,935 --> 01:44:05,769
About last night... please forgive me.

685
01:44:07,908 --> 01:44:10,672
I was waiting, thinking you'd come to me.

686
01:44:18,452 --> 01:44:19,783
Brother...

687
01:44:23,257 --> 01:44:26,124
I'm gonna report to the office first.

688
01:44:27,060 --> 01:44:35,297
But I think it'll be a problem if you're with me.
So please rest at a hotel or some place today.

689
01:44:36,370 --> 01:44:38,668
I'm coming with you to the office.

690
01:44:39,806 --> 01:44:42,434
I'd like to say hello to Boss.

691
01:44:57,557 --> 01:45:00,048
Well, I don't get it.

692
01:45:01,928 --> 01:45:03,122
Do you?

693
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:05,127
No.

694
01:45:05,966 --> 01:45:07,957
You?
- No.

695
01:45:10,404 --> 01:45:13,464
You don't make any sense at all, you know.

696
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:17,669
I understand if you don't.

697
01:45:18,278 --> 01:45:22,044
I still can't believe it myself. But...

698
01:45:23,083 --> 01:45:25,608
But that woman is definitely brother.

699
01:45:27,454 --> 01:45:28,716
What?

700
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:33,054
You wanna end up in the disposal site yourself?

701
01:45:34,428 --> 01:45:38,558
If you keep talking nonsense like that, you will.

702
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:46,473
But it's true!

703
01:45:46,473 --> 01:45:48,709
Is this the office of the Azamawari Group?

704
01:45:48,709 --> 01:45:50,506
Not yet!
- Who are you?

705
01:45:55,015 --> 01:46:00,476
I'm Sakiko, the daughter of Torada who
was under your boss' wing a long time ago.

706
01:46:01,788 --> 01:46:03,619
I'm Azamawari.

707
01:46:05,926 --> 01:46:07,826
Who did you say it was?

708
01:46:10,097 --> 01:46:13,965
My name is Sakiko, the
daughter of Ushikichi Torada.

709
01:46:14,634 --> 01:46:16,727
Ushikichi Torada...

710
01:46:18,605 --> 01:46:20,300
Does that ring a bell?

711
01:46:37,057 --> 01:46:40,026
Come have a seat.

712
01:46:44,731 --> 01:46:46,600
Torakichi Ushida, is it?

713
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:48,329
It's Ushikichi Torada.

714
01:46:51,605 --> 01:46:58,534
My father always said you had helped him
a lot, all the time, when he was alive.

715
01:46:58,745 --> 01:47:00,406
When he was alive?

716
01:47:00,714 --> 01:47:02,773
He died of cancer last month.

717
01:47:04,084 --> 01:47:05,551
I see.

718
01:47:05,986 --> 01:47:12,391
I'm very sorry...I see.

719
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:16,696
Oh, I got it!

720
01:47:16,696 --> 01:47:23,537
He was the type of man who'd fight
against anyone for justice, wasn't he?

721
01:47:23,537 --> 01:47:25,027
Exactly.

722
01:47:26,006 --> 01:47:30,010
Ah, Tora! It's Tora.

723
01:47:30,010 --> 01:47:32,740
I used to look after him way back when.

724
01:47:35,315 --> 01:47:41,379
I see, I see, so you're Tora's daughter.

725
01:47:41,621 --> 01:47:44,624
Actually, I came to ask you a favor.

726
01:47:44,624 --> 01:47:45,852
A favor?

727
01:47:46,126 --> 01:47:50,730
Could you please find me a job?

728
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:55,902
A job?
- Actually, I'd like to work here.

729
01:47:55,902 --> 01:47:57,199
Here?

730
01:48:02,275 --> 01:48:04,368
What are you thinking?

731
01:48:09,883 --> 01:48:11,976
Sakiko.
- Yes.

732
01:48:14,287 --> 01:48:19,893
Well, I'd like to sort out some paperwork
at home immediately. Can you help me?

733
01:48:19,893 --> 01:48:21,554
Yes, my pleasure.

734
01:48:22,529 --> 01:48:24,331
Hey!
-Yeah!

735
01:48:24,331 --> 01:48:27,323
What are you doing?
- Tell him to go to the square.

736
01:48:34,441 --> 01:48:35,874
Have a good day!

737
01:49:05,305 --> 01:49:07,739
There's no need to worry.

738
01:49:09,409 --> 01:49:13,413
I'll take care of everything
for you from now on.

739
01:49:13,413 --> 01:49:15,711
So don't worry about a thing.

740
01:49:16,516 --> 01:49:17,881
Is that true?

741
01:49:21,054 --> 01:49:23,921
It is true.

742
01:49:35,602 --> 01:49:37,502
Do you want to take a shower?

743
01:49:43,243 --> 01:49:48,613
Which smell would you prefer, soap or me?

744
01:49:53,587 --> 01:49:55,919
You, of course!

745
01:49:58,191 --> 01:50:01,024
Just a moment! Let me get ready.

746
01:50:27,554 --> 01:50:30,022
I can't get it up without this.

747
01:50:41,334 --> 01:50:42,631
Ouch!

748
01:50:47,507 --> 01:50:51,341
It's coming, coming, coming!

749
01:51:27,213 --> 01:51:31,741
Oops, I was about to come too soon.

750
01:52:45,658 --> 01:52:47,023
Help!

751
01:52:51,698 --> 01:52:53,689
What's that?
-Help me!

752
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:03,542
What? Minami!

753
01:53:06,579 --> 01:53:09,275
What are you doing?
- Help me! Hurry!

754
01:53:17,857 --> 01:53:19,654
What the hell are you doing, Minami?

755
01:53:27,167 --> 01:53:29,192
I won't give my brother to anyone!

756
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:36,970
What are you saying, you stupid punk!

757
01:53:45,151 --> 01:53:47,449
Get up!

758
01:55:37,263 --> 01:55:38,730
Minami...

759
01:55:48,775 --> 01:55:50,174
Brother...

760
01:56:01,487 --> 01:56:06,686
Please take this.

761
01:56:07,627 --> 01:56:09,185
What is this?

762
01:56:09,529 --> 01:56:12,521
Givenchy crotchless panties.

763
01:56:17,737 --> 01:56:19,796
A gift from my brother.

764
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:26,942
But I want you to have it, brother.

765
01:56:28,748 --> 01:56:33,708
Thank you. I will use them carefully.

766
01:57:03,116 --> 01:57:04,777
That's great!

767
01:57:18,197 --> 01:57:19,596
Come.

768
01:57:28,007 --> 01:57:29,668
Put it inside me.

769
01:57:58,037 --> 01:57:59,834
It's wonderful.

770
01:58:15,988 --> 01:58:18,388
Are you sure about this?

771
01:58:19,992 --> 01:58:21,516
It's alright.

772
01:58:22,328 --> 01:58:24,319
Leave it to your brother...

773
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:33,204
I'm already like this.

774
01:58:57,363 --> 01:58:58,853
Right here...

775
01:59:12,745 --> 01:59:15,475
You can come inside...

776
01:59:28,794 --> 01:59:33,629
Come in deeper. Deeper...

777
01:59:42,208 --> 01:59:44,540
I might break you, brother.

778
01:59:45,645 --> 01:59:51,015
I'm fine. I beg you, deeper...

779
01:59:58,324 --> 02:00:00,155
Deeper, please!

780
02:00:16,342 --> 02:00:17,934
I came...

781
02:05:49,942 --> 02:05:51,239
Brother?

782
02:06:09,328 --> 02:06:10,659
Minami!

783
02:06:39,992 --> 02:06:41,254
Brother...

784
02:06:42,294 --> 02:06:43,591
Brother?

785
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:06,818
The woman became normal again
when we put her in hot water.
