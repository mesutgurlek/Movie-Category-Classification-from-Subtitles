1
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,195
<i>(man)</i> You'll like this. I guarantee it.

2
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,072
<i>(woman)</i> Yes!

3
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,952
Oh, Abe, I love this.

4
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,833
<i>(Abe)</i> Well, you loved it
when you picked it out.

5
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,872
- <i>(woman)</i> OK, open yours.
- I will.

6
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,277
- Did you know?
- No.

7
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,153
- He didn't tell you?
- No! I swear to God.

8
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,229
Like father, like son.
The two of you are from the same mold.

9
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,596
Happy anniversary.

10
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,910
Happy anniversary.

11
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,314
Are you OK?

12
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,470
- You were tossing and turning all night.
- I know. I don't know what this is.

13
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,672
Come on. Let's go get some breakfast.

14
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,717
- Danny, are you hungry?
- Yeah, sure.

15
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,354
Come on. Let's get something to eat.

16
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,634
Danny, if you're gonna
play with your food,

17
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,550
at least you've gotta have fun doing it.

18
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,235
There. How's that?

19
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,757
- Are you OK, buddy?
- I don't feel so good.

20
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,233
Honey, are you all right?

21
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,914
Come on, let's get out of here.

22
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,759
<i>(stammers unintelligibly)</i>

23
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,319
Can I get some help over here?
Just relax. Sit down.

24
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,158
Here, let me help.

25
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,155
I'm so sorry.

26
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,796
It's the whys that are killing me.

27
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,313
Why were we in that restaurant
on that day at that hour?

28
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,516
Why did that lunatic get it into his head
to kill my wife and my son?

29
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,229
Why not kill me, too?
I mean, he leaves me behind?

30
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,396
Why?

31
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,675
It's just so...

32
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,313
random.

33
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,395
<i>(Abe laughs) Nice job.</i>

34
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,795
<i>I'm the king.</i>

35
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,874
- <i>Here, Dad's gonna catch you.</i>
- <i>(Abe laughs)</i>

36
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,833
- <i>You better throw far.</i>
- <i>Don't kill me.</i>

37
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,916
<i>(Abe) What could go wrong?</i>

38
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,632
<i>(woman) Careful.</i>

39
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,636
<i>(Danny) I see you.</i>

40
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,154
<i>My dad taught me to swim.</i>

41
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,113
<i>(woman) Would you consider Dad</i>
<i>tall or short? Very short?</i>

42
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,552
<i>(Abe) We short people have thick skin cos</i>
<i>it doesn't get stretched over a tall frame.</i>

43
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,750
The reason my wife and son
were murdered...

44
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,598
was because of me.

45
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,992
Because I wasn't able to help them
when they needed me most.

46
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,469
<i>(woman) Happy anniversary.</i>

47
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,556
I should've saved them.

48
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,276
<i>I should've saved them.</i>

49
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,356
<i>(woman) Slow motion.</i>

50
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,835
<i>(Danny) Yes!</i>

51
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,190
<i>(woman) The winner. The winner!</i>

52
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,155
<i>(phone rings)</i>

53
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,234
<i>(Abe on answering machine)</i>
<i>I know this is upsetting,</i>

54
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,670
<i>but I have to be with my wife and son.</i>

55
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,358
<i>Goodbye.</i>

56
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,993
<i>(machine beeps)</i>

57
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,989
<i>(man) Christ, Abe, don't do anything</i>

58
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,788
- Is this our OD?
- Yeah.

59
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,718
- You know how many of these he took?
- I don't know, man.

60
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,673
<i>(man)</i> Get him on an IV.
Start him on normal saline.

61
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,314
<i>(woman)</i> Pulse rate 47 and dropping.

62
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,510
- Putting a line in.
- He's crashing.

63
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,473
Give him atropine. Saline wide open.

64
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,989
- Give him the full amp.
- <i>(woman)</i> We're losing him.

65
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,076
- Asystole.
- Checking respirations.

66
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,794
Starting CPR. Come on.

67
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,957
- <i>(woman #1)</i> He's dying.
- <i>(woman #2)</i> Come on.

68
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,436
- He's still in V-fib.
- <i>(woman #1)</i> No pulse.

69
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,550
- <i>(man)</i> Did you give him the full amp?
- <i>(woman #1)</i> Yes. He's not responding.

70
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,390
Come back to us. Continue compressions.

71
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,636
No response. Do you wanna call it?

72
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,228
Could be fine V-fib. Give me the paddles.

73
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,116
Charge to 200.

74
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,117
Charged to 200.

75
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,719
<i>(man)</i> Clear.

76
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,995

78
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,390
360. Clear.

80
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,154
Clear.

81
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,868
- <i>(woman #1)</i> We've got a sinus rhythm.
- <i>(woman #2)</i> Pressure's climbing.

82
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,116
We're getting a response.

83
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,197
It's OK. We brought you back.

84
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,638
Check his oxygen saturation.

85
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,070
<i>(woman)</i> Oxygen saturation is good.

86
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,112
Blood pressure is 140 over 60.

87
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,589
Hi. You're awake.

88
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,075
I'm Sherry Clarke.
You're in Saint Elizabeth's ICU.

89
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,829
- Are you my doctor?
- Better. I'm your nurse.

90
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,195
The light hurts my eyes.

91
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,877
- How long have I been here?
- A couple of days.

92
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,757
Dr. Karras has been keeping an eye
on you. You're his latest project.

93
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,914
Do you wanna watch some TV?

94
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,868
- Anything in particular?
- No.

95
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,995
Oh, dude, you lucked out.
This is my favorite movie of all time.

96
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,837
<i>We belong dead.</i>

97
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,156
<i>(static buzzes)</i>

98
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,639
Hello, Abe. I'm Dr. Karras.
I'm just gonna have a little look.

99
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,591
- Are you OK?
- I've been better.

100
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,756
Remember why you're here?

101
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,078
You were legally dead, but, lucky for you,
modern medicine knows no limits.

102
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,751
- I died?
- Technically speaking. You had an NDE.

103
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,997
- I don't know what that is.
- Near-death experience.

104
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,875
It's my field of expertise. I fought to make
sure you were my patient. Let me guess.

105
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,438
You saw a white light that engulfed you,
almost seemed to beckon you to stay.

106
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,358
Yeah, that's exact...
How did you know that?

107
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,554
As many as eight out of ten people who've
had an NDE report seeing a white light.

108
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,513
- Freaky, huh?
- What about the light I'm seeing now?

109
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,430
- It's probably an aura, a type of residue.
- So it's normal?

110
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,269
I'd say we're well beyond
the bounds of normal here, but yes.

111
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:11,350
You'll see 'em less frequently as time
passes and eventually they'll disappear.

112
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,040
<i>(static buzzes)</i>

113
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,631
<i>(crash)</i>

114
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,076
<i>(clown music plays)</i>

115
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,436
<i>(clown music)</i>

116
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,114
<i>(music echoes and distorts)</i>

117
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,710
<i>(static buzzes and crackles)</i>

118
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,076
<i>(distorted electronic voices)</i>

119
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,515
<i>(growling)</i>

120
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,036
<i>(distorted electronic voices)</i>

121
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,072
<i>(echoing voice) She's with us.</i>

122
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,033
<i>She's with us.</i>

123
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,272
<i>She's with us.</i>

124
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,155
So everything looks fine.

125
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,670
No masses, no deviations
in your intracranial space.

126
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,553
But I've seen it three times
in the past few days.

127
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,750
- Seen what?
- The white light.

128
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,829
And there's something else.
You're gonna think I'm crazy, but, um...

129
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,229
I'm seeing and hearing
all kinds of electrical stuff.

130
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,595
EVP stands for
electronic voice phenomena.

131
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,748
Precognition, the light you're seeing,
all that is part of supernatural white noise.

132
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,429
- I've got a grant to study these things.
- So EVP, what exactly is it?

133
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,839
It's the recording of the deceased using
a detuned apparatus like a TV or radio.

134
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,635
Some people believe that EVP
is the afterlife manifest all around us.

135
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,877
Others think it's a charge
or electromagnetic fields,

136
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,596
still others that it's a means through
which the dead can communicate with us.

137
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,110
Frankly, who knows? As long as
we're not exactly sure what it is,

138
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,118
they'll keep funding my grant.

139
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,234
What are you doing down here?

140
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,151
This... is my EVP room.

141
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,714
These have been detuned and I record 'em
to see if I've captured any transmissions.

142
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,628
I suppose that's an important part
of your work, then?

143
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,797
That? Oh.
No, I didn't want to detune that one.

144
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,914
That's <i>Change of Habit</i>.
I'm recording it for research purposes.

145
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,477
I thought I might learn something
from Dr. Presley.

146
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,599
- You're not a fan of this one?
- No, it's just...

147
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,837
I just saw one of those things
on the screen.

148
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,276
Transmissions are only visible
after they've been recorded.

149
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,595
On the last close-up of Elvis,

150
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:13,033
I saw a blast of static with
what looked like an unformed person.

151
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,110
- So what are you doing now?
- I've rewound the feed, I'll detune it.

152
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,152
Let's see if you really saw something.

153
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,557
There. There, that's it. That's it.

154
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,911
That was it. That's what I saw.

155

<i>(shrieking)</i>

156
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,356
- I'll be damned.
- So what does that mean?

157
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,270
Maybe when you had your NDE,
you yourself became a detuned receiver.

158
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:01,350
You see white-noise transmissions, EVP,
communications with the dead, all that,

159
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,436
without any of this.

160
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,908
You're in uncharted territory.

161
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,113
There's a very good chance you're
going to be seeing some wacky stuff.

162
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,308
I've got to go.
I've got a doctor's appointment.

163
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,319
Sure. Take all the time you need.
Hey, I'm still saving all the clippings

164
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,874
and articles about the shooting and stuff.

165
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,039
I don't want to hear about the day my wife
and son were brutally murdered, OK?

166
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,072
I just can't handle that right now. I...

167
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,675
I refuse.

168
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,310
Hi. Dr. Karras asked...

169
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,036
What's wrong?

170
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,594
Dr. Karras is dead.

171
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,830
- What?
- He had a heart attack early this morning.

172
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,997
I'm sorry.

173
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,878
- <i>(man)</i> OK, so this...
- EVP.

174
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,470
EVP.

175
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,194
It draws your attention to the white light.

176
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,154
When you see the light, you think
it means... What do you think it means?

177
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,751
That somebody's gonna die. Like with
Dr. Karras, it could be a couple of days.

178
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:39,398
With the woman, it could be hours,
just depending on how strong the light is.

179
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,275
I don't know, but I'm seeing it more and
it's driving me nuts. It's like being God.

180
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,518
- I'm worried about you, Abe.
- Well, how would you explain it, then?

181
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,200
How about, "I don't know"?

182
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,393
In a city, we probably cross paths with
people who are about to die all the time.

183
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,114
- We just don't know it.
- But what if I do, Marty?

184
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,356
What if I do know
when somebody will die?

185
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,758
- And now you've got this superpower?
- It's not a superpower.

186
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,957
Call it what you want, but that sure as hell
sounds like superhero bullshit to me.

187
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,275
Stop talking all this nonsense.

00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,754
It's busted.

308
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,789
I'm so sorry.

309
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,270
That's OK.

310
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,391
- You're hurt. Let me look.
- It's fine.

311
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,476
Hey.

312
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,629
Let me fix you up.
It's the least I can do. Come on.

313
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:20,712
It's a superficial laceration. Nothing a few
stitches and antibiotics can't take care of.

314
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:25,789
You are either staring at my ring
or admiring my rack. Which is it?

315
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,390
- The ring. I was...
- I'm just kidding.

316
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,517
It's my old wedding ring.
My husband died a couple of years ago

317
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,916
so I like to keep it close to my heart.

318
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,759
You must have loved him very much.

319
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,074
Yeah.

320
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,597
He was a music teacher
at Sacred Heart Elementary,

321
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,075
and those kids adored him.

322
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,671
He had a unique approach. No doh-ray-mi
crap. He'd organize this recital every year,

323
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,873
have the kids sing Bowie, Pink Floyd,
Rush, The Beach Boys, Jane's Addiction.

324
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,073
- You name it.
- Sounds amazing.

325
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,636
Yeah. It was incredible.

326
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,833
But the end just... It came so quick.

327
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,556
One day we're just living, you know?

328
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,829
Then, boom, he's dead.

329
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,195
That's terrible.

330
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,072
Yeah.

331
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,196
But...

332
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,629
I wake up

333
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,751
and it just hit me.

334
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,395
I had to let Tommy go.

335
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,750
I'll see him again someday. Until then,

336
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,031
you have to accept
what it's supposed to be about.

337
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,632
- Did you two have any kids?
- No.

338
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,309
No. But I still put on the recital
every year in his honor.

339
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,795
The next one's in a couple of days.

340
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,875
- And you should totally come.
- Maybe.

341
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,479
Here.

342
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,680
Take this. Think it over.

343
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,553
Call me if you're interested.

344
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,508
Hey, the cops are here.

345
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,552
Yeah. Tell them their timing sucks.

346
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,198
<i>(Danny) Is this the present you got Dad</i>
<i>for your anniversary? Can I see it? Can I?</i>

347
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,959
<i>I don't suppose your dad</i>
<i>put you up to this, did he?</i>

348
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:56,278
<i>(Danny) No way. Just wondering is all.</i>
<i>I bet it's that watch he wanted, right?</i>

349
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,039
<i>You tell your dad</i>
<i>that he's just gonna have to wait.</i>

350
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,469
<i>Besides, it's just a few days away.</i>

351
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,473
<i>(bus horn blares)</i>

352
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,834
- <i>Are you all right?</i>
- <i>I'm OK, Mom. That man saved our lives.</i>

353
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,633
<i>Thank you!</i>

354
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,479
<i>That's all right.</i>

355
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,630
<i>That's all right.</i>

356
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,278
Henry Caine.

357
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,834
<i>(electronic whine)</i>

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,669

<i>Should not have saved.</i>

<i>have saved.</i>

363
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,992
- Julia Caine? My name is Abraham...
- Abraham Dale.

364
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,237
I always knew you'd come.
Please, come on in.

365
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,272
Excuse the mess. We're moving.

366
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,355
I am so sorry for what my husband did
to your wife and son.

367
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,838
Henry was the most down-to-earth, don't-
question-things guy you could ever meet.

368
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,996
So, uh...

369
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,234
so what happened, then?

370
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,874
He, uh...

371
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,355
he had a near-death experience.

372
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,790
He was hit by a drunk driver head-on.

373
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,311
He must have died three times that night.
They finally revived him in the early hours

374
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,796
and then we brought him home
a week later.

375
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,876
That's when it all began -

376
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,869
the strange behavior,
the weird ideas about life, about death.

377
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,639
He just got so obsessed
with the paranormal.

378
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,993
EVP, the white light,
precognition, all that kind of stuff.

379
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,237
He even thought he could save people.

380
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,756
At first I thought it was understandable.
This man almost died.

381
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,839
But then it just got to be too much.

382
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,951
What do you mean by too much?

383
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,919
I'll show you.

384
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,913
You see? I'll leave you to it.

385
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,879
Oh, shit!

386
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,237
<i>(screeching)</i>

387
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,955
<i>(echoing voices)</i>

388
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,078
Henry was always blowing fuses in here.

389
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,033
Really? Hm.

390
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,991
Um...

391
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,470
Do you have any idea
what the e stands for?

392
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,715
No.

393
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,197
Would you mind if I took
some of this stuff to look over?

394
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,675
Sure. I don't want any of it.

395
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,999
Look, I am sorry again
for what my husband did.

396
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,918
I can't believe how far gone he is.

397
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,396
- "Is"? What are you talking about?
- What do you mean?

398
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,512
- You said "is".
- And?

399
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,030
Don't you mean "was"?
"How far gone he was"?

400
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,116
You don't know?

401
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:21,115
- <i>(Julia) Henry's still alive.</i>
- <i>(Abe) I saw him pull the trigger.</i>

402
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,118
<i>(Julia) He survived.</i>
<i>He's over at Belmont County.</i>

403
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,196
<i>(Abe) The asylum.</i>

404
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,238
We keep him up here.
He's been with us a couple of months,

405
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,749
since he slipped out of coma land.

406
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,838
If you ask me,
he ain't never gonna see a courtroom.

407
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,188
Why?

408
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,993
Old Henry...

409
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,634
he sees dead people.

410
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:07,590
Don't mind me. I'm just gonna stick
around and make sure you boys play nice.

411
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,355
My wife and my son.

412
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,830
Why did you do it?

413
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,793
Why did you kill them?

414
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,117
If save, must kill.

415
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,238
Jesus, you're even crazier
than I thought you'd be.

416
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,316
If save,

417
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,954
responsible.

418
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,674
Responsible for what?

419
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,114
Consequences.

420
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,470
Horrific consequences.

421
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,951
What consequences?

422
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,669
It will never end if you let him in.

423
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,390
You cannot shut the dead out.

424
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,672
The dead will haunt you
until you put right what you've done.

425

If you save, you must...

It's a three.

435

- Hi, Abe.
- Hi.

438
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,996
So I just finished the rehearsals for
that recital thingy I was telling you about,

439
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,430
so I was basically in the neighborhood,

440
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,788
and, uh...

441
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,115
Hi.

442
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,835
- I hope you don't mind that I stopped by.
- No, no. I don't...

443
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,916
I don't mind. Um...

444
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,394
But why?

445
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,476
When...

446
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,108
is the last time you drank
a cheap bottle of wine?

447
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,357
That's very kind,
but you really don't have to do that.

448
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,630
I know I don't have to.

449
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,671
I want to.

450
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,631
I'm married.

451
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,034
But thank you.

452
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,672
Abe, I read your file.

453
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,828
I know why you were in the ICU
when we first met.

454
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,430
I know what happened
to Rebecca and Danny.

455
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,198
You saved my life the other night.

456
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,433
I'd love to return the favor.

- Calm down.
- You don't...

615
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,470
- Calm down.
- You don't understand.

616
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,273
- Get away from her.
- It doesn't involve you!

617
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,358
Listen to me. Sherry!

No, no, no. Not here. Anywhere but here.

623
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:27,028
Here's the menu.
I'll be right back to take your order.

624
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:31,668
The old man who killed all those people,
you saved him.

01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,270
And the kid from the hotel,
you saved him too.

626
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,672
And then you saved me.

627
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,554
I'm so sorry, Sherry.

628
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,829
Don't be.

629
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,309
That man, he has a gun.

630
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:24,079
Police. Put the gun down.

631
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:28,591
Listen to him, sir.
No one wants to get hurt, right?

632
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:32,952
Put it down.

633
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:17,515
Please, just make it stop.

634
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,231
You...

635
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,510
you have to die.

636
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,152
Ma'am.

637
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,555
