00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:46,863
<i>(Saxton) The following report</i>
<i>to the Royal Geological Society</i>

2
00:02:46,946 --> 00:02:52,785
<i>by the undersigned, Alexander Saxton,</i>
<i>is a true and faithful account</i>

3
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:58,458
<i>of events that befell</i>
<i>the Society's expedition in Manchuria.</i>

4
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,210
<i>As the leader of the expedition,</i>

5
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:06,632
<i>I must accept responsibility</i>
<i>for its ending in disaster.</i>

6
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:10,553
<i>But I will leave to the judgment</i>
<i>of the honourable members</i>

7
00:03:10,636 --> 00:03:16,267
<i>the decision as to where the blame</i>
<i>for the catastrophe lies.</i>

8
00:04:01,312 --> 00:04:03,356
(Man whistling)

9
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,593
(Wind whistling)

10
00:04:51,946 --> 00:04:54,282
(Train whistle)

11
00:05:33,363 --> 00:05:38,076
- I'm sorry, there isn't a seat left.
- My name is Saxton, Alexander Saxton.

12
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:42,080
If you will check, you will find the telegram
I sent you three weeks ago

13
00:05:42,163 --> 00:05:44,207
instructing you to reserve accommodation.

14
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,460
- (Phone ringing)
- There's nothing I can do.

15
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:51,631
Hello? Yes.

16
00:05:54,342 --> 00:05:58,971
Well, well, look who's here.
Professor Saxton, I presume?

17
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:01,974
- Doctor Wells.
- And what are you doing in Shanghai?

18
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:05,728
- I might ask you the same thing.
- I'm just collecting a few specimens.

19
00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:08,981
Miss Jones, let me introduce
Professor Alexander Saxton.

20
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:11,984
He dabbles in fossils and bones.

21
00:06:12,068 --> 00:06:14,112
Glad to meet you, Professor.

22
00:06:14,195 --> 00:06:17,907
Miss Jones has been assisting me.
Bacteriology, excellent technician.

23
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:20,076
(Chuckles) For a woman, he means.

24
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:37,093
(Speaks Chinese)

25
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,827
Excuse me.

26
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:06,539
Two private compartments to Moscow,
if you please.

27
00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:11,252
- Two, you say? Will that be all?
- And three crates of animals.

28
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:14,839
- Impossible.
- I know I'm asking you to perform miracles.

29
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:17,216
But perhaps this will help.

30
00:07:44,452 --> 00:07:46,329
Thank you.

31
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:49,749
It's called "squeeze" in China.
The Americans call it know-how.

32
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:53,378
And in Britain, we call it bribery and corruption.

33
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:56,881
Now, sir, excuse me.

34
00:08:06,265 --> 00:08:08,851
You! Get out!

35
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:11,688
Halt! Sir Alexander Saxton?

36
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:16,776
- Yes.
- Captain 0'Hagan, sir.

37
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:19,987
General Wang told me to find you
and to make myself useful.

38
00:08:21,989 --> 00:08:26,327
Um... um... now I remember!
I do have Your Excellency's ticket.

39
00:08:28,454 --> 00:08:32,959
- Your... your ticket, right here.
- Thank you.

40
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:35,086
(Chanting)

41
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:47,306
And the Lord have mercy on his soul.

42
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,478
Not that he deserves it, the dirty thief!
You have his things?

43
00:08:52,562 --> 00:08:57,400
- You knew him?
- Krasinsky, the locksmith?

44
00:08:57,483 --> 00:08:59,944
He could open any trunk with a hair pin.

45
00:09:06,701 --> 00:09:09,746
A thief? But he was blind!

46
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:13,750
Blind?
He could spot the police well a mile away.

47
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:20,089
I'll be dammed.

48
00:09:24,802 --> 00:09:26,929
The work of the devil!

49
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:40,068
Can I be of any assistance, Father?

50
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:45,281
- This is yours?
- It is, but I demand an explanation.

51
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:51,954
Whatever you have here is unholy
and must be destroyed.

52
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:05,635
Inspector Mirov.
What is in there, Excellency?

53
00:10:05,718 --> 00:10:08,221
Fossils.

54
00:10:08,304 --> 00:10:10,598
What is a fossil?

55
00:10:10,682 --> 00:10:12,433
A stone.

56
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:15,019
Stones?

57
00:10:15,103 --> 00:10:18,272
There wouldn't be something valuable
in there like gold?

58
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:21,693
Gold?! It's a laboratory specimen.

59
00:10:21,776 --> 00:10:23,695
No value to a thief.

60
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:25,988
Where there is God...

61
00:10:27,156 --> 00:10:30,243
there is always a place for the cross.

62
00:10:30,326 --> 00:10:33,454
Even on this stone floor, just so.

63
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:44,590
But Satan is evil and where evil is,
there is no place for the cross!

64
00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:03,901
- Rubbish! A conjurer's trick. Captain.
- Yes, sir.

65
00:11:03,985 --> 00:11:07,071
You get your men to put the crate on the train.

66
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:14,954
Ready?

67
00:11:18,374 --> 00:11:21,961
Lift it up. 0ff you go.

68
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:28,384
(Bells tolling)

69
00:11:42,272 --> 00:11:44,733
- Where is crate C?
- It's over there, sir.

70
00:11:44,816 --> 00:11:46,860
0h, yeah. Come on.

71
00:11:47,486 --> 00:11:49,529
Be careful with this one.

72
00:12:12,928 --> 00:12:14,680
Follow me!

73
00:12:17,057 --> 00:12:19,434
(Snarling)

74
00:12:34,616 --> 00:12:36,660
(Engine whistling)

75
00:13:53,653 --> 00:13:56,948
What are you going to astound
the scientific world with this time?

76
00:13:57,032 --> 00:13:59,785
You'll read about it
in the Society's annual report.

77
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:02,746
- It's a remarkable fossil.
- Fossil?

78
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:04,873
But you've got something live. I heard it.

79
00:14:04,956 --> 00:14:09,002
- You're mistaken.
- You won't need to feed it, then?

80
00:14:09,086 --> 00:14:12,089
The occupant hasn't eaten in two million years.

81
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:15,217
That's one way to economise on food bills.

82
00:14:18,428 --> 00:14:20,263
Baggage man.

83
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,853
- Alinka, what's the matter with you?
- Yes, Countess?

84
00:14:26,937 --> 00:14:31,525
- You have a safe for valuables?
- Yes, Countess. I shall make out a receipt.

85
00:14:36,905 --> 00:14:38,782
Excuse me.

86
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:46,081
Alinka's afraid of something.
What do you have in that crate?

87
00:14:46,164 --> 00:14:49,876
0h, nothing that would interest Alinka, Madame.

88
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,090
Normally she likes Englishmen.

89
00:14:55,173 --> 00:14:58,760
- All we Poles do.
- I am honoured, Madame.

90
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:05,017
0h, yes, England.
Queen Victoria, crumpets, Shakespeare.

91
00:15:06,018 --> 00:15:10,856
I admire Poland, Madame, I believe that
there is a bond between our countries.

92
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:16,862
My husband, the Count Petrovski,
says that in the 15th century

93
00:15:16,945 --> 00:15:21,533
your King Henry
betrayed us to the Russians, hm?

94
00:15:22,326 --> 00:15:26,246
I hope you and your husband will accept
my profoundest apologies.

95
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,332
She's really afraid.

96
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:34,463
I wonder what it is.

97
00:15:34,546 --> 00:15:37,632
May I escort you back to your carriage,
Madame?

98
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:49,225
(Train whistle)

99
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,871
Yours?

100
00:16:11,581 --> 00:16:14,458
0h, thank you. Excuse me.

101
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:16,878
Yes?

102
00:16:16,961 --> 00:16:20,798
I was on the platform before,
when that mad monk was carrying on.

103
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:25,219
- Yes?
- I'm an engineer, a scientist.

104
00:16:29,182 --> 00:16:31,392
And this is ordinary chalk.

105
00:16:33,102 --> 00:16:36,439
How do you explained it
not writing on that crate?

106
00:16:36,522 --> 00:16:38,900
Hypnosis. Yoga.

107
00:16:38,983 --> 00:16:43,279
These mystics can be very convincing.
They can even hypnotise themselves.

108
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:58,294
The fresh food we will pick up,
who will pay for it, sir?

109
00:16:58,377 --> 00:17:02,381
Hmm? 0h, just keep an account
of how much you spend. Er...

110
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:08,930
lf... um... someone were to drill a little hole
in this crate during the night

111
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:14,810
and take a look at what's inside,
I'd be very grateful.

112
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,456
(Guard) That's in order.

113
00:17:39,168 --> 00:17:40,795
Help me.

114
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:45,007
In what way, Madam?

115
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:53,683
- Is this number 8?
- That's next door, Wells' compartment.

116
00:17:55,476 --> 00:17:57,937
There, there, don't cry.

117
00:17:59,397 --> 00:18:01,274
Everything will be all right.

118
00:18:03,943 --> 00:18:05,152
Excuse me.

119
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:12,368
Sorry, dear fellow, I'm afraid you're in the
wrong pew. Here, number 8, do you see?

120
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:16,455
8A, lower berth.

121
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:20,126
8B, upper berth.

122
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:23,963
Don't worry. I was supposed to have
this compartment to myself.

123
00:18:24,046 --> 00:18:26,382
- If you don't mind.
- Sorry if I'm in your way.

124
00:18:26,465 --> 00:18:30,636
Excuse me, I have no ticket
and I have to get out of Shanghai.

125
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,849
- I'm sure I can make it worth your while.
- The young lady's in trouble.

126
00:18:34,932 --> 00:18:37,226
What do you suggest we do about it?

127
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,105
- Couldn't you double up with somebody else?
- Miss Jones?

128
00:18:42,064 --> 00:18:45,526
I'm sure we can all get along
very well together.

129
00:18:55,661 --> 00:18:58,122
(Man whistles tunefully)

130
00:20:49,942 --> 00:20:51,694
(Clinking)

131
00:20:57,074 --> 00:20:59,869
(Key drops on floor, padlock rattling)

132
00:21:45,248 --> 00:21:47,917
(Tuneful whistling)

133
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,423
(Whistling)

134
00:22:02,473 --> 00:22:04,559
(Whimpers)

135
00:22:07,311 --> 00:22:12,650
There's the stink of hell on this train,
even the dog knows it.

136
00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:20,283
When the Englishman comes to call,
what should I wear?

137
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,744
Sure of yourself, aren't you?

138
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:26,330
The blue one with the décolleté...

139
00:22:27,415 --> 00:22:29,041
or perhaps the red one.

140
00:22:32,295 --> 00:22:34,630
You are jesting with her immortal soul.

141
00:22:35,715 --> 00:22:41,053
That's why we keep you, Pujardov.
0ur immortal souls are your concern.

142
00:22:41,095 --> 00:22:42,597
(Whimpering)

143
00:22:46,434 --> 00:22:48,269
She is afraid of something.

144
00:22:50,146 --> 00:22:53,399
- Tell me, Pujardov...
- Yes?

145
00:22:53,482 --> 00:22:56,819
Which do you think
I should wear for the Englishman?

146
00:22:56,903 --> 00:22:59,947
- The red or the blue?
- Enough!

147
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:05,119
- I forbid you to talk this way.
- You forbid?

148
00:23:07,497 --> 00:23:10,791
Forgive me, Your Excellency.

149
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:17,089
In my concern for the spiritual welfare
of the Countess, I forgot myself.

150
00:23:17,173 --> 00:23:19,717
I will pray for humility.

151
00:23:22,178 --> 00:23:26,849
Pray hard, Pujardov
or you'll find yourself praying for a job, too.

152
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:30,186
Hail Father and The Son and the Holy Ghost...

153
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:32,855
(Eerie whistling)

154
00:23:46,077 --> 00:23:51,582
0h, it's the piece I was playing.
I wonder who it is.

155
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:56,462
(Plays piece on the piano)

156
00:23:59,757 --> 00:24:01,843
(Train whistle)

157
00:24:23,531 --> 00:24:25,575
(Distant door opening)

158
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:35,293
You wish to see us?

159
00:24:35,376 --> 00:24:39,088
I thought one of you might know
what happened to the baggage man.

160
00:24:39,172 --> 00:24:42,175
- I haven't the remotest idea.
- What about you?

161
00:24:44,218 --> 00:24:46,888
Perhaps it had something to do
with what's in that crate.

162
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:51,309
I agree with you. He was trying to open it
when something happened.

163
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:52,977
What?!

164
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:02,737
- Fortunately, he was interrupted.
- Yes. By whom?

165
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:07,366
Why are you so worried
about it being opened?

166
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:12,830
It may be my fault. I asked the baggage man
to take a look. I was curious.

167
00:25:12,914 --> 00:25:14,957
It was no concern of yours.

168
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:17,668
0r of yours.

169
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:21,506
Goodnight.

170
00:25:23,257 --> 00:25:26,552
0ne man dead, another missing.
It's time we opened this box.

171
00:25:26,636 --> 00:25:28,888
You'll do no such thing!

172
00:25:29,972 --> 00:25:32,642
Give me the key.

173
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:51,160
Konev, see if you can open the crate with that.

174
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:55,206
Go ahead!

175
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:40,710
My God... it's the baggage man.

176
00:26:41,627 --> 00:26:44,297
- What was in there?!
- I told you, a fossil.

177
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,924
Part ape, part man.
It lived two million years ago.

178
00:26:47,008 --> 00:26:51,095
Are you telling me that an ape
that lived two million years ago

179
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:54,432
got out of that crate,
killed the baggage man and put him in there,

180
00:26:54,515 --> 00:26:57,435
then locked everything up neat and tidy
and got away?

181
00:26:57,518 --> 00:27:01,397
- Yes, I am! It's alive, it must be!
- Lock him up.

182
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,151
We'll search the train and find it, whatever it is,
and destroy it.

183
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:08,362
- But if it's alive...
- I want this kept quiet!

184
00:27:08,446 --> 00:27:10,907
I don't want to panic the passengers.

185
00:29:23,164 --> 00:29:24,916
(Muffled scream)

186
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,146
My glass is empty.

187
00:30:29,856 --> 00:30:33,025
0h, forgive me, my mind was elsewhere.

188
00:30:34,694 --> 00:30:36,737
What is it?

189
00:30:36,821 --> 00:30:39,490
I'm sorry, I can't tell you.

190
00:30:45,121 --> 00:30:47,790
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

191
00:30:47,832 --> 00:30:49,458
Good evening.

192
00:30:51,586 --> 00:30:53,629
Haven't we met?

193
00:30:54,714 --> 00:30:56,716
I don't believe so.

194
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,886
Yes, at the Governor's palace. General Wang.

195
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,847
You're mistaken.

196
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:09,604
0f course. I beg your pardon.
It was somebody else.

197
00:31:22,158 --> 00:31:24,827
What's the matter?

198
00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:28,539
The eye of that fish, it's white.

199
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:32,335
Naturally, it's boiled.

200
00:31:33,503 --> 00:31:36,589
Boiled... yes.

201
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,433
- Is it true you're a doctor?
- Ask me when I've finished my dinner.

202
00:31:47,517 --> 00:31:50,811
- It's urgent.
- What are the symptoms?

203
00:31:50,895 --> 00:31:54,732
He's dead, you saw him.
- 0h, that one.

204
00:31:54,815 --> 00:31:57,068
There's nothing I can do for him.

205
00:31:57,151 --> 00:32:00,530
Now there's one more dead.
0ne of my soldiers, same white eyes.

206
00:32:00,613 --> 00:32:03,574
- I want to know the cause of death.
- Who's dead?

207
00:32:03,658 --> 00:32:05,993
Keep your nose out of it!
You didn't hear anything.

208
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:10,081
Excuse me.

209
00:32:12,124 --> 00:32:14,669
Is Professor Saxton's fossil still at large?

210
00:32:14,752 --> 00:32:19,090
I think the fossil or whatever it is escaped,
jumped off the train.

211
00:32:23,094 --> 00:32:28,683
- Miss Jones, I shall need your assistance.
- Yes, well, at your age, I'm not surprised.

212
00:32:31,978 --> 00:32:35,439
- With an autopsy!
- 0h, well, that's different.

213
00:32:48,536 --> 00:32:50,371
Very curious.

214
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:55,585
A genetic defect, obviously.

215
00:32:58,462 --> 00:33:00,506
- Scalpel.
- Uh-hm.

216
00:33:03,885 --> 00:33:05,928
Can you keep that still.

217
00:33:10,474 --> 00:33:12,935
- (Man) What is he doing?
- Trepan.

218
00:33:26,949 --> 00:33:28,993
Don't get up, please.

219
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:38,794
I see you have decided to dine alone,
Sir Alexander.

220
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:44,091
I've eaten in worse circumstances
and in worse company.

221
00:33:49,055 --> 00:33:51,098
Handsaw.

222
00:33:51,182 --> 00:33:53,226
Here you are, Doctor.

223
00:34:01,901 --> 00:34:05,321
You're in bad humour because
you've lost your box of bones.

224
00:34:09,826 --> 00:34:14,997
That "box of bones", Madame, could have
solved many of the riddles of science.

225
00:34:16,123 --> 00:34:21,295
If the theory of evolution is confirmed,
if the science of biology is revolutionised,

226
00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:24,048
if the very origin of man is determined...

227
00:34:24,131 --> 00:34:27,802
I have heard of evolution, it's... it's immoral.

228
00:34:27,885 --> 00:34:32,098
It's a fact... and there's no morality in a fact.

229
00:34:39,272 --> 00:34:43,401
And what about the baggage man
and that poor thief at the station?

230
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:47,238
- What about them?
- They are dead.

231
00:34:50,074 --> 00:34:52,118
Was your creature responsible for that?

232
00:34:53,911 --> 00:34:55,538
Probably.

233
00:34:56,664 --> 00:34:59,333
And you don't care?

234
00:35:00,835 --> 00:35:03,629
A baggage man and a thief?

235
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:10,720
You're right, Madame,

236
00:35:10,803 --> 00:35:14,056
I don't care as much as I should.

237
00:35:18,269 --> 00:35:20,438
Can you tell me how he died?

238
00:35:23,566 --> 00:35:28,112
Smooth as a baby's bottom.
You saw this man today and he was normal?

239
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:32,116
- Absolutely.
- It must be a mutation, a freak of nature.

240
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,952
What's so special about this brain?

241
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:40,291
Learning and memory
are engraved on the normal brain,

242
00:35:40,374 --> 00:35:43,252
leaving a wrinkled surface.

243
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:49,300
This brain has been drained,
the memory has been removed

244
00:35:49,383 --> 00:35:52,803
like chalk erased from a blackboard.

245
00:36:45,189 --> 00:36:47,233
- (Knocking)
- Come in.

246
00:36:48,025 --> 00:36:50,570
Thank you. It's all yours.

247
00:36:53,406 --> 00:36:55,241
I won't be long.

248
00:39:31,856 --> 00:39:34,984
Miss? It's Doctor Wells.

249
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:40,198
Miss, are you all right?

250
00:40:19,904 --> 00:40:21,906
Miss, are you there?

251
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,790
(Gunshot)

252
00:40:38,464 --> 00:40:40,550
(Creature growling)

253
00:40:42,134 --> 00:40:44,178
(Snarling)

254
00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:11,205
(Gunshot)

255
00:42:14,936 --> 00:42:16,562
(Knocking)

256
00:42:18,189 --> 00:42:19,857
Come in.

257
00:42:20,775 --> 00:42:22,401
Feeling better?

258
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:26,364
Yes.

259
00:42:26,447 --> 00:42:28,491
Anything wrong?

260
00:42:28,574 --> 00:42:33,329
That woman who was killed -
the engineer, you know, the chess player,

261
00:42:33,412 --> 00:42:36,249
he told me that she was an international spy.

262
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:40,586
- Yes, I know.
- 0h, you do?

263
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:44,173
Well, could that fact have had anything
to do with her death?

264
00:42:44,257 --> 00:42:46,133
What do you think?

265
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,555
Doctor Wells and I performed
an autopsy on her.

266
00:42:50,638 --> 00:42:53,975
Her brain was completely smooth,
just like the baggage man's.

267
00:42:54,058 --> 00:42:56,894
Everything had been erased.
I have a theory about this.

268
00:42:56,978 --> 00:43:00,565
I'm only a policeman, Professor,
I don't have much education.

269
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:05,278
Well, I'll make it simple.

270
00:43:05,361 --> 00:43:08,948
Supposing that creature, the one you killed,

271
00:43:09,031 --> 00:43:12,451
was capable of taking ideas
directly from other people's brains

272
00:43:12,535 --> 00:43:14,787
and transferring them to its own.

273
00:43:14,871 --> 00:43:19,959
- You mean it sucked other people's brains?
- Absorbed, through the eyes.

274
00:43:23,754 --> 00:43:27,133
That was our first clue. The eyes going white.

275
00:43:28,217 --> 00:43:31,512
Then if the beast had absorbed your brains,

276
00:43:31,596 --> 00:43:35,474
all of your education
would have gone into its brain.

277
00:43:35,558 --> 00:43:38,019
It would have been as clever as you.

278
00:43:38,102 --> 00:43:41,606
Much more so
because what it had taken from me

279
00:43:41,689 --> 00:43:45,276
would have been added to the learning
that it already had.

280
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:49,280
Professor, spy, baggage man, thief.

281
00:43:50,865 --> 00:43:53,284
What was the creature looking for?

282
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:57,413
Well, that we'll never know
now that it's dead and yet...

283
00:43:57,497 --> 00:43:59,123
What?

284
00:44:00,166 --> 00:44:03,169
A creature like that...

285
00:44:03,836 --> 00:44:05,671
how would it ever die?

286
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:09,217
- Inspector?
- What is it?

287
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,969
I found this. The animal had it.

288
00:44:12,053 --> 00:44:14,597
- (Saxton) The animal had it?
- Give it to me!

289
00:44:15,973 --> 00:44:19,393
- It belonged to Count Petrovski.
- How do you know?

290
00:44:19,477 --> 00:44:22,146
I saw him put it in the safe.

291
00:44:33,032 --> 00:44:37,745
Steel - harder than a diamond.
That's why the spies are after it.

292
00:44:38,496 --> 00:44:43,042
The French, German, English.
But they are wasting their time.

293
00:44:44,252 --> 00:44:46,921
What really matters is the formula

294
00:44:47,004 --> 00:44:51,384
and that, gentleman, is safe... up here.

295
00:44:56,264 --> 00:44:59,058
What happened to the girl? The spy.

296
00:44:59,141 --> 00:45:03,271
She's dead.
The fossil or whatever it was killed her.

297
00:45:03,354 --> 00:45:06,315
- But there's no more danger.
- The beast is not dead.

298
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:08,401
I put four bullets into him.

299
00:45:11,362 --> 00:45:14,448
You think evil can be killed with bullets?

300
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:17,910
Satan lives.

301
00:45:19,078 --> 00:45:23,207
The unholy one... is among us!

302
00:45:23,291 --> 00:45:27,879
0h, Shalom, Shalom, Shalom. 0h, Shalom.

303
00:46:00,077 --> 00:46:01,829
Specimen jar.

304
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:08,044
- What do you expect to find in the eye fluid?
- I don't know.

305
00:46:37,073 --> 00:46:39,534
- Why, this is incredible.
- What?

306
00:46:44,747 --> 00:46:47,291
It's the last thing the creature saw!

307
00:46:50,044 --> 00:46:54,090
- The police inspector.
- The image has been retained in the fluid.

308
00:46:54,173 --> 00:47:00,429
Exactly. The creature's visual memory
is located not in its brain but in the eye itself.

309
00:47:43,055 --> 00:47:44,891
Can you identify anything?

310
00:47:45,766 --> 00:47:47,810
It's a brontosaurus!

311
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,105
A pterodactyl.

312
00:47:51,189 --> 00:47:53,232
(Train whistle)

313
00:48:22,803 --> 00:48:24,639
(Saxton) Incredible.

314
00:48:25,765 --> 00:48:28,017
This is not a map.

315
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,022
(Saxton) It can only be the Earth
seen from space.

316
00:48:33,773 --> 00:48:38,694
I hope I'm not intruding. People on the train
are becoming afraid, Professor.

317
00:48:38,778 --> 00:48:44,700
People on long journeys become bored,
Madame. They crave excitement.

318
00:48:45,827 --> 00:48:49,413
- Then there's no more danger?
- It's all finished.

319
00:48:50,957 --> 00:48:54,794
And what about your science?
The evolution you were talking about?

320
00:48:56,504 --> 00:48:58,339
Look for yourself.

321
00:49:11,894 --> 00:49:13,938
Come here, Pujardov.

322
00:49:15,439 --> 00:49:18,109
There's something I want to show you.

323
00:49:22,864 --> 00:49:24,490
Look.

324
00:49:33,916 --> 00:49:35,668
(Russian)

325
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:43,342
It is the Holy Writ.

326
00:49:45,136 --> 00:49:48,931
0n the second day, he created the earth.

327
00:49:54,103 --> 00:49:55,730
Where did you get it?

328
00:49:56,856 --> 00:49:58,941
There, from the creature's eye.

329
00:50:04,405 --> 00:50:09,243
- The eye of Satan!
- Nonsense. There's a scientific explanation.

330
00:50:10,536 --> 00:50:12,580
Do you know it?

331
00:50:14,248 --> 00:50:15,583
No.

332
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:18,544
Not yet.

333
00:50:21,547 --> 00:50:27,136
Before the fall, before Satan
was banished from the throne of God,

334
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:31,849
the Evil 0ne looked down from heaven
and did see...

335
00:50:31,933 --> 00:50:33,184
Rubbish!

336
00:50:44,195 --> 00:50:46,155
Pujardov!

337
00:50:57,708 --> 00:51:01,629
- Pujardov? Where is he?
- I don't know.

338
00:51:02,713 --> 00:51:04,799
He's gone mad.

339
00:51:09,262 --> 00:51:11,722
- I'll look in the baggage car.
- Right.

340
00:52:16,204 --> 00:52:21,042
- Looking for the thief, Miss Jones?
- You know about it.

341
00:52:22,043 --> 00:52:24,962
What's all the fuss?

342
00:52:28,508 --> 00:52:32,303
You get back that eye
and there's a thousand roubles in it for you.

343
00:52:33,429 --> 00:52:36,015
A thousand rubbles for an eye?

344
00:52:38,017 --> 00:52:40,061
There's something in it.

345
00:52:41,145 --> 00:52:44,232
- Pictures.
- Pictures of what?

346
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:51,822
Pictures of the earth in prehistoric times.
Pictures of the earth seen from space.

347
00:52:52,698 --> 00:52:54,742
Who else has seen such pictures?

348
00:52:56,494 --> 00:53:00,581
Dr Wells, Professor Saxton
and that pretty Countess.

349
00:53:01,457 --> 00:53:03,084
I see.

350
00:54:03,686 --> 00:54:06,147
Have pity, have pity.

351
00:54:16,616 --> 00:54:18,659
Are you going to kill me?

352
00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:24,624
Fool. There's nothing in your head of any use.

353
00:54:31,756 --> 00:54:33,799
Another killing.

354
00:54:41,766 --> 00:54:45,645
- (Man) Stop the train! I want to get off!
- (Woman) There's no law!

355
00:54:45,728 --> 00:54:49,607
Quiet!
There's been talk about getting off the train.

356
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:52,944
- Well, you can forget it.
- I'll complain to the authorities.

357
00:54:53,027 --> 00:54:58,157
- I'm not one of your muzhiks!
- I'll shoot anyone who tries to stop the train.

358
00:54:58,241 --> 00:55:01,118
Shoot?! Shoot?! You stupid Russian!

359
00:55:16,801 --> 00:55:19,262
<i>(Inspector) Who else has seen</i>
<i>such pictures?</i>

360
00:55:19,345 --> 00:55:22,098
<i>(Dr Jones) Dr Wells...</i>

361
00:55:22,181 --> 00:55:24,976
<i>Professor Saxton...</i>

362
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:29,021
<i>and that pretty Countess.</i>
<i>Wells, Saxton and the Countess.</i>

363
00:55:29,105 --> 00:55:32,608
<i>Wells, Saxton and the Countess</i>
<i>Wells, Saxton and the Countess...</i>

364
00:55:40,283 --> 00:55:44,620
Wells, is this creature dead or not?

365
00:55:45,746 --> 00:55:48,833
If it is, who killed Miss Jones?

366
00:55:52,128 --> 00:55:56,132
- Do you have any idea?
- No, Inspector, I haven't.

367
00:55:56,215 --> 00:55:59,510
I've asked the conductor to wire ahead
to stop at the next station.

368
00:56:13,149 --> 00:56:14,984
What's the idea?

369
00:56:41,302 --> 00:56:43,346
Tell me who you are.

370
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,480
Tell me. I will serve you.

371
00:57:05,368 --> 00:57:08,162
I want to help you.

372
00:57:08,246 --> 00:57:11,249
It's like some contagious disease.

373
00:57:11,332 --> 00:57:14,627
Well, if there's a disease,
there must be symptoms.

374
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:18,714
- Fever?
- You could take everyone's temperature.

375
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:21,801
The eyes, why do their eyes go white?

376
00:57:42,739 --> 00:57:46,242
Do you think it's true what they say
about those horrible white eyes?

377
00:57:46,326 --> 00:57:48,828
0h, that part is true enough.

378
00:57:52,207 --> 00:57:56,670
- Ah, Inspector, there's only you now.
- What about me?

379
00:57:56,753 --> 00:58:00,215
Your eyes. We must examine your eyes, too.

380
00:58:02,425 --> 00:58:04,135
Certainly.

381
00:58:11,267 --> 00:58:14,979
Perhaps you should test for radiation
or other invisible rays.

382
00:58:15,063 --> 00:58:20,568
X-rays? Well it's a thought,
but on this train how would we go about it?

383
00:58:21,486 --> 00:58:25,615
- Are you a scientist?
- An engineer, but I try to keep up with things.

384
00:58:26,574 --> 00:58:29,494
That's to be admired.

385
00:58:29,577 --> 00:58:35,166
Inspector, I suggest you tell all these people
to stay together, in groups or in pairs,

386
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:39,087
so that if anything does happen to anybody,
then somebody can raise the alarm.

387
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:41,423
0n no account must anybody be left alone.

388
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:58,773
(Engine whistle)

389
00:59:26,551 --> 00:59:28,595
(Ringing)

390
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,557
(Ringing)

391
00:59:42,901 --> 00:59:44,944
News of the train.

392
01:00:01,169 --> 01:00:04,839
The train will be here in exactly...

393
01:00:04,923 --> 01:00:08,343
um... 14 minutes.

394
01:00:09,886 --> 01:00:12,138
(Man) 14 minutes?

395
01:00:12,222 --> 01:00:15,100
Yes, Your Honour, that's what it says here.

396
01:00:21,106 --> 01:00:25,735
Doesn't say it in words, Your Honour,
but in code. It's like another language.

397
01:00:25,819 --> 01:00:29,155
I know about telegraph, Little Papa.

398
01:00:29,239 --> 01:00:32,200
I know about trains,
I know about electrical currents.

399
01:00:33,868 --> 01:00:35,870
0n your feet, everybody!

400
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:44,212
0utside, full pack! Even though I still believe
in God, I don't like to be made a fool of!

401
01:00:44,295 --> 01:00:46,756
No, Your Honour.

402
01:00:49,759 --> 01:00:51,845
I wouldn't do that.

403
01:00:54,848 --> 01:00:57,684
Tell me, Little Father...

404
01:00:57,767 --> 01:00:59,811
do you believe in the devil?

405
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,815
Yes.

406
01:01:06,151 --> 01:01:08,611
Ah, good, send a telegram.

407
01:01:10,363 --> 01:01:12,741
Tell them that Captain Kazan,

408
01:01:12,824 --> 01:01:18,830
he knows that a horses has four legs,
he knows that a murderer has two arms,

409
01:01:18,913 --> 01:01:21,374
but still the devil...

410
01:01:22,459 --> 01:01:27,672
must be afraid of one honest Cossack, hm?

411
01:01:49,861 --> 01:01:53,156
Earth's gravity, you know how to measure it?

412
01:01:53,239 --> 01:01:55,241
How to measure gravity?

413
01:01:56,117 --> 01:01:59,663
What I would like to know is
can gravity be overcome?

414
01:02:01,665 --> 01:02:06,294
If you mean, can man get beyond
the gravitational field of the earth into space,

415
01:02:06,378 --> 01:02:08,505
not yet, but any day now.

416
01:02:10,006 --> 01:02:11,466
Someday?

417
01:02:11,549 --> 01:02:14,427
There is a mathematics professor,
his name is Chelkovsky.

418
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:18,682
He has ideas about rockets, machines
that can fly free of the earth's gravity.

419
01:02:20,642 --> 01:02:22,686
You know him?

420
01:02:26,064 --> 01:02:30,276
Chelkovsky was one of my teachers,
he was like a father to me.

421
01:02:31,111 --> 01:02:34,489
But why would a man like you be interest...

422
01:03:06,021 --> 01:03:09,149
What do you think is behind all this, Excellency?

423
01:03:11,026 --> 01:03:14,738
Look at this.
That's what we saw under the microscope.

424
01:03:14,821 --> 01:03:19,200
- Shows the Earth as it might look from space.
- What does it mean?

425
01:03:19,868 --> 01:03:24,789
It means that millions of years ago something,
some form of intelligence,

426
01:03:24,873 --> 01:03:27,250
came to the Earth from another planet.

427
01:03:27,334 --> 01:03:31,129
The atmosphere of the earth was new to it,
different.

428
01:03:31,212 --> 01:03:34,632
- But it learnt how to survive.
- How?

429
01:03:34,716 --> 01:03:40,055
By entering into the body and brain
of an Earth creature.

430
01:03:40,138 --> 01:03:42,599
The fossil that I found and brought with me.

431
01:03:42,682 --> 01:03:45,810
And this thing from another planet
survived in the fossil?

432
01:03:45,894 --> 01:03:48,396
- Then came to life again?
- Exactly.

433
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,523
Go on, Professor.

434
01:03:51,858 --> 01:03:58,448
The animal that you shot was only the host
and, when that animal died,

435
01:03:58,531 --> 01:04:04,204
the alien intelligence
transferred somehow to another host.

436
01:04:06,498 --> 01:04:10,919
It's alive... in someone on this train.

437
01:04:11,795 --> 01:04:13,630
You're a very good detective.

438
01:04:13,713 --> 01:04:17,842
You've discovered everything
except who is now the host.

439
01:04:17,926 --> 01:04:21,554
- That's our next step.
- Thought this might come in handy.

440
01:04:21,638 --> 01:04:25,100
- 0h, good idea.
- Two of you together, that's fine.

441
01:04:25,183 --> 01:04:31,564
- But what if one of you is the monster?
- Monster? We're British, you know.

442
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:43,284
But you must have seen something.

443
01:04:43,368 --> 01:04:45,537
I told you, I was asleep.

444
01:04:47,539 --> 01:04:50,208
He knew about the white eyes, he told me.

445
01:04:51,459 --> 01:04:55,505
When you fell asleep, the lights were on?
And when you woke up?

446
01:04:55,588 --> 01:04:58,133
- They were off.
- Are you sure?

447
01:04:58,216 --> 01:05:05,181
Positive. It was dark. I put the lights on.
And that's when I found him... beside me.

448
01:05:06,391 --> 01:05:09,269
When we did the test, the lights were on.

449
01:05:12,564 --> 01:05:14,065
Master!

450
01:05:46,181 --> 01:05:47,682
Inspector.

451
01:05:51,728 --> 01:05:55,231
This steel at high temperatures,
what happens to it?

452
01:05:58,985 --> 01:06:02,530
It gets stronger.
What temperatures, for example?

453
01:06:03,156 --> 01:06:05,367
Ten or twelve thousand degrees.

454
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:08,578
Where on earth
would you get such temperatures?

455
01:06:08,662 --> 01:06:10,705
Nowhere on Earth.

456
01:06:12,457 --> 01:06:14,125
(Brakes screeching)

457
01:06:49,661 --> 01:06:53,164
The Tsar will hear of this!
I'll have you sent to Siberia!

458
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:57,836
I am in Siberia.

459
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:02,841
This is Countess Irina Petrovska
and I am Count Maryan Petrovski.

460
01:07:02,924 --> 01:07:05,760
0h, Your Excellencies, I am sorry.

461
01:07:06,678 --> 01:07:10,348
0f course, the Count and Countess
are exempt from our orders.

462
01:07:10,432 --> 01:07:13,727
Please, escort them to their car.

463
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:26,906
Peasants. Peasants!

464
01:07:36,374 --> 01:07:38,001
Are you a Countess?

465
01:07:38,084 --> 01:07:42,255
I'm an American and I'm not accustomed
to being bullied by foreigners.

466
01:07:42,339 --> 01:07:46,468
That man, he's the one who wouldn't
let us get off the train, he's responsible.

467
01:07:53,725 --> 01:07:58,271
- Your Excellency, I am a Police Inspector.
- Everybody is under arrest!

468
01:08:02,776 --> 01:08:04,652
Including you.

469
01:08:06,321 --> 01:08:10,283
Who are the killers?
Who? Who are the trouble-makers?

470
01:08:17,499 --> 01:08:19,542
Who are the foreign influences, huh?

471
01:08:21,753 --> 01:08:23,254
Who?!

472
01:08:25,882 --> 01:08:29,177
Don't worry, I'll smoke them out.

473
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:31,554
What's he raving about?

474
01:08:42,065 --> 01:08:46,236
- You English believe in free speech, huh?
- Certainly.

475
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:50,031
If instead of babbling nonsense,
you'd investigate this properly...

476
01:08:50,115 --> 01:08:52,158
This is outrageous!

477
01:08:54,244 --> 01:08:59,582
So... you are a police inspector, huh?

478
01:08:59,624 --> 01:09:02,210
Yes, Captain. Mirov is my name.

479
01:09:02,293 --> 01:09:05,422
Mirov? 0h, Mirov!

480
01:09:06,923 --> 01:09:09,259
That's a good Russian name, Mirov.

481
01:09:11,469 --> 01:09:17,058
Tell me, Mirov, what do you know about
all the filth that's going on here, huh?

482
01:09:17,142 --> 01:09:20,437
- Filth?
- Certainly you know what I'm doing here.

483
01:09:22,313 --> 01:09:26,443
You just point out the suspects
and I promise you I'll get the truth out of them.

484
01:09:26,526 --> 01:09:28,820
You're mistaken, sir.

485
01:09:29,863 --> 01:09:32,449
- Mistaken?
- Fool!

486
01:09:40,749 --> 01:09:43,418
Get back, get back!

487
01:09:43,501 --> 01:09:47,839
Back! 0r I will put a curse on your heads!

488
01:09:52,302 --> 01:09:53,845
He has the evil eye!

489
01:10:02,687 --> 01:10:06,524
Beware of the wrath of Satan!

490
01:10:22,832 --> 01:10:24,459
Fool, huh?

491
01:10:27,587 --> 01:10:29,673
0n your knees, monk.

492
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:48,566
We must stop this.

493
01:11:09,838 --> 01:11:14,718
- He was trying to protect you, why?
- He's mad.

494
01:11:18,304 --> 01:11:22,100
- Who are you?
- I told you, a policeman.

495
01:11:45,999 --> 01:11:47,834
No!

496
01:12:01,431 --> 01:12:03,850
No!

497
01:12:03,933 --> 01:12:06,436
You saw his eyes!
0ne look at them and you're dead!

498
01:12:20,909 --> 01:12:23,161
Come into me, Satan!

499
01:12:25,455 --> 01:12:29,292
Thine is the kingdom and the power
and the glory!

500
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:35,423
Thy will be done on earth as it is in hell.

501
01:12:38,176 --> 01:12:42,722
Now, anything!
Anything that moves near that door, kill it!

502
01:12:44,265 --> 01:12:48,395
- But what if the monk is innocent?
- Ah, we got lots of innocent monks!

503
01:12:48,478 --> 01:12:52,190
All right, let's move these peasants out of here!
Quickly!

504
01:14:13,938 --> 01:14:17,067
Everybody back to the baggage car. Hurry!

505
01:15:56,792 --> 01:15:58,252
There!

506
01:16:01,922 --> 01:16:05,634
He always kills in the dark,
he can't play his tricks in a strong light.

507
01:17:23,378 --> 01:17:25,589
- Take care of the others.
- What about you?

508
01:17:25,672 --> 01:17:28,342
- I'll be all right, go on.
- Well, you take this.

509
01:17:33,096 --> 01:17:34,765
(Train whistle)

510
01:17:53,742 --> 01:17:58,205
You know, in spite of everything,
Pujardov had a certain affection for you.

511
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:07,089
Yet you humiliated often,
even in front of the Countess.

512
01:18:53,927 --> 01:18:57,222
(Sobbing) He's dead.

513
01:18:59,641 --> 01:19:01,435
You killed him!

514
01:19:01,518 --> 01:19:04,897
If you want to kill Pujardov, it's too late.

515
01:19:06,398 --> 01:19:10,652
- I'll see you hanged!
- Ah, poor monk.

516
01:19:10,736 --> 01:19:15,115
He loved you
more than he loved the promise of heaven.

517
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:24,291
0ver there, quickly, over there!
Irina, behind me.

518
01:19:32,424 --> 01:19:34,468
It would be a mistake to kill me.

519
01:19:36,011 --> 01:19:39,723
- Who are you?
- In words, it's difficult.

520
01:19:39,806 --> 01:19:43,060
I am a form of energy occupying this shell.

521
01:19:45,395 --> 01:19:49,191
- Where do you come from?
- Another galaxy.

522
01:19:51,985 --> 01:19:53,820
I came with others like myself.

523
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,826
I was left behind. An accident.

524
01:19:58,909 --> 01:20:03,497
I survived in protozoans, fish, vertebrates.

525
01:20:04,414 --> 01:20:08,502
The history of your planet is part of me.

526
01:20:10,546 --> 01:20:14,258
Pull the trigger and you will end it.

527
01:20:17,928 --> 01:20:20,180
What am I to do with you?

528
01:20:21,515 --> 01:20:24,309
- Let me go.
- That's not possible.

529
01:20:24,393 --> 01:20:26,770
It is possible.

530
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:33,068
I will teach you to end disease, pain, hunger.

531
01:20:36,029 --> 01:20:37,030
Wait!

532
01:20:38,782 --> 01:20:41,368
There is something more.

533
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:32,044
- Saxton!
- (Gunshot)

534
01:21:36,924 --> 01:21:38,091
Go!

535
01:21:52,147 --> 01:21:54,316
Yahhhh!

536
01:22:02,032 --> 01:22:04,535
(Irina screaming)

537
01:22:05,953 --> 01:22:08,413
Let me go! 0h, no!

538
01:22:26,723 --> 01:22:28,475
(Shrieking)

539
01:23:11,143 --> 01:23:13,187
(Train whistle)

540
01:23:45,052 --> 01:23:47,095
Saxton, thank God!

541
01:23:49,473 --> 01:23:51,558
Stand back, please, make room.

542
01:24:19,294 --> 01:24:23,006
Moscow says to stop the Express
when it goes through the switching point.

543
01:24:28,095 --> 01:24:31,515
Derail it?
That means killing everybody on board!

544
01:24:34,393 --> 01:24:36,603
That's what it says.

545
01:24:36,687 --> 01:24:41,650
Maybe there's a war. Maybe it's war.

546
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:21,857
(Screaming)

547
01:26:10,531 --> 01:26:12,741
(Eerie whistling)
