- All right?
- Let me get the other two out of the bus.

Shut the fuck up and hand me the keys.

They're in the bus. I dropped them.

or I'll blow your face off.

and fucking arrow? Who the fuck does that?

I don't know, and I don't give a shit.

All I know is we're all getting

[ Groans ]

Fuck. What's up with these keys?

352
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,711
There are three different sets of keys.

353
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:41,350
One for the cuffs, one for the cage
and one for the leg irons.

- So hand me the other ones.
- They were in the bus. I told you.

- This is the only set I found.
- Fucking liar. Kill him.

I say who lives and who dies.

The fuck you do, asshole.

Let's just find out exactly what's going on
around here. All right?

00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:05,540
- When was Hazelton expecting us?
-Just before dawn.

360
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:09,781
All right. Now, that gives us
a five-hour head start.

361
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:13,585
Man, we ain't going anywhere in a hurry
all tethered together by the ankles like this.

362
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:17,492
You're right. We have to find a way
of getting out of these irons.

363
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:21,658
You. Sheriff said you grew up around here.
Which way do we go?

364
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,725
- It's been years. I don't know.
-Just kill the son of a bitch, man.

- Yeah.

- Good.
- What about whoever's out there?

370
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,911
They won't be coming back
if they know what's good for them.

371
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,681
Now, which way do we go?

372
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,785
There's an old forest ranger's fire watchtower
near the top of the mountain.

373
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,921
It should have communication equipment.

374
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,988
- A radio. Maybe a cell phone.
- Good.

00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:58,297
So pick up your pig and lead the way.

00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,981

Hurry it up.

00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:35,397
- [ Muttering ]
- Take it easy.

386
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,703
- Take it easy. Nobody wants to hurt you.
- Is that one of 'em?

387
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,836
- A fucking little bitch did all this?
- Don't be stupid.

388
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:43,210
She's not who I saw on the tow truck.
She's got nothing to do with this.

- You're gonna be fine.

00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,776
[Floyd]
Maybe we should fuck her first.

00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:51,822
I don't know about you,
but it's been a long time.

Who are you? What are you doing here?

393
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,685
Just let me go before it finds me.

394
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,855
- Please.
-Just let her go. We don't need her.

What happened to you?

00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,293
My friends and I were rafting
on the Bluefish River...

00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,703
two days ago.

399

We were having a good time.

400
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,271
We stopped for the night.
Then it happened.

401
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:16,677
- What?
- It killed my friends.

402
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:19,717
"lt"? I thought it was
just some hillbilly.

403
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:22,776
- It eats people.
- [ Laughing ]

404
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:26,051
No. You got to be out of your mind.

405
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,524
It's a fucking mutant! Deformed!

406
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:32,791
It's got, like, three fingers on one hand.
And it kills to feed.

407
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,729
I've seen it.

408
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,233
So then, why doesn't it eat
the animals in the woods?

409
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:42,205
Because there are none.
It's a cannibal. We're its food.

410
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,400
[Nate ]
We're gonna get you out of here.

411
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,909
Everything's gonna be okay.
What's your name?

412
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:50,141
- Alex.
- I'm Nate.

413
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,809
Looks like you're screwed too,
aren't you, Nate?

414
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,478
Did you just say rafts?

415
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,880
Yeah. Two of 'em.

416
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,325
Then that's our way out of here.

417
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,623
Down the river.

418
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,757
Now, you take us there, sugar tits,
and I'll make it worth your while.

419
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,631
I think I was better off with that freak.

420
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,934
Now move. Move!

421
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,311
Hey. How old do you think she is?

422
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,374
I don't know, man. Twenty maybe.

423
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:32,754
Goddamn it. I think I'm gonna
make that one sit and spin.

Man, not if l don't first.

Hey, baby. Baby.
Hey, you like-you like cars?

- I can jack you any car
your sweet little ass wants.
- [ Laughing ]

427
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,327
Huh? Aw.

428
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,467
Well, would you look at that.

429
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:54,534
[ Crawford] Hey, Floyd, check it out.
Is that an armored car?

430
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,544
[Nate ]
Which way?

431
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,675
I'm not sure.
[ Sighs ]

432
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,152
I thought it was this way.

433
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,553
But it doesn't look familiar.

434
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,692
- [ Nate ] Careful.
- [ Walter Groans ]

435
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:17,532
You. How old would you say
that thing is?

436
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,828
[ Nate ]
Late '50s maybe.

437
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,340
Let's go.

438
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:30,745
- [ Clanking ]
- [ Grunting ] Still locked.

439
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:34,182
- Climb in the cab and take a look around.
- We're wasting valuable time.

00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,186
- Let's just go.
- He's right.

441
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:39,417
- Let's go.
- [ Shotgun Cocks ]

442
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:43,153
Shut the fuck up, bitch, and don't even
think about giving me an attitude.

443
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:46,685
'Cause I'll shoot you where you stand,
you hear?

444
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:51,565
You. I said climb in the fucking cab
and take a look around.

445
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,917
- Any dead bodies?
- No. They're gone.

446
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:18,190
They must have been ejected.
You guys have a look around for bones.

447
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,253
One of the guards must have had some keys.

448
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,390
I don't think you'll find anything.

449
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,560
[ Chavez]
Why?

450
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,001
Because somebody broke the windshield
from the outside to get inside.

451
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:29,062
All the glass is in here.

452
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,906
And judging from the amount
of dried blood, they died in the cab.

453
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:37,209
- You find anything else?
- No.

454
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:39,511
Then get out of there.

455
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,050
Found these.

456
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,157
This might just be our lucky day.

457
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,572
Well, I'll be damned.

458

Sweet Mother of Jesus!

- How much money do you think's in there?
- [Brandon ] Who cares?

00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,385
[ Floyd ]
What is this place?

619
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:02,227
[ Chavez ]
This doesn't look like the watchtower.

620
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:04,767
It's not. I've never seen
this place before.

621
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:07,668
There has to be some tools
that we can use on these chains.

622
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:10,263
- [ Chavez] And you better make it quick.
- Move.

623
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:18,004
- [ Clanking]
-Jackpot!

624
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:21,142
- Give me that.
- Wait your turn, asshole. [ Grunts ]

[Metal Clanking]

627
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:33,029
- How much farther?
- [ Panting ] I'm not sure.

628
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,292
- A couple of hours maybe.
- You better find it.

629
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:42,134
Oh-ho-ho, man. I got to go pinch a loaf.

630
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:45,468
- I say we split up.
- No.

631
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:48,875
- Maybe it's a good idea.
- You think this is a democracy?

632
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:52,074
- You wanna fuckin' debate me?
- What happens when we meet up with your men?

633
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:54,276
What are you gonna do then, Chavez?

634
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:56,649
What ever happened
to honor among thieves?

635
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,212
You're gonna kill us all, then you're
gonna take the cash for yourself.

636
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:03,748
- That's what you're gonna do.
- Yeah, you're right.

637
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:06,057
I probably will kill all of you.

638
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,826
- Then why shouldn't we kill you now, eh?
- Good luck.

639
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:11,129
And you better be quick,
or you're surely gonna be dead.

640
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,465
Then I'll kill all you motherfuckers.

641
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:17,702
But I don't think
that's in your best interest...

642
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:21,074
- compared to a compromise.
- [ Chuckling ] Hey. Hey.

643
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:23,045
I just wiped my ass with a $100 bill.

644
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:27,914
It's comin' out of your share, asshole.
Now, shut the fuck up.

645
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:30,818
- What do you propose?
- You got one gun. I got two.

646
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:32,822
These humps have none.

647
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:36,758
Now, I can't carry
all the bags of cash on my own.

648
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:39,819
And if you kill me,
that's one less pair of hands.

649
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:42,058
Plus I have something none of you do.

650
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,396
- Yeah? What's that?
- lnfrastructure.

651
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,765
What?

652
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:48,270
My men will find me.

653
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:52,172
And all of you can come with us
to a safe house and not be on the run.

654
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:55,507
And in exchange for that, you give me
one of the bags you're all carrying...

655
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,843
and you all get to keep the other one.

656
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:00,440
How can you trust him, Floyd?

657
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:02,712
We can't.

658
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,916
Deal.

659
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,925
Now get this bum up.

660
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:21,066
Sorry about your friends.

661
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:24,039
This isn't going to end well.

662
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:27,838
- I know that.
- Then why are you going along with them?

663
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:29,845
Up to now, being all chained together...

664
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:32,473
I really didn't have
much of a choice, did l?

665
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:38,354
So that's the fourth time we've passed
that tree in the last two hours.

666
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,683
What are you up to, Nate?

667
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:44,249
Bidin' my time.

668
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:47,627
Chavez catches on, man, he'll kill you.

669
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:52,431
He's right, Nate.
Even I noticed. You gotta be careful.

670
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:58,099
[ Nate ] You should go back to the road.
Turn yourself in when the police arrive.

671
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:01,167
I am not going back
through the woods alone, unarmed...

672
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:04,408
to get sliced up by that hillbilly freak.

673
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,915
I don't know who's worse- him or Chavez.

674
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,319
Listen.

675
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:13,914
I'll do what I can to help you
once we've reached the ranger station.

676
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:16,789
I appreciate that, but I think you should
look after yourself first.

677
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,454
Chavez isn't gonna bring anyone
along for the ride that he can't use.

678
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,463
You're damn right.

679
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,965
He'll kill us all for the money.

680
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,502
If that cannibal freak
doesn't beat him to it.

681
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:30,796
[ Exhales ]
It's ironic.

682
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:35,010
- What is?
- Money.

683
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,308
I struggled my whole life
to put myself through school...

684
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:40,942
- so I could get out of here and make good money.
- So?

685
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:45,421
Now I'm holding in my hands more money
than most people ever make in a lifetime...

686
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:47,650
and all I wanna do is get rid of it.

[ Panting ]

688
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:22,221
This is a logging access road.
Fire watchtower's on the other side...

689
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,816
- further along the mountain.
- Hang on. Hang on.

- Hang on. Hang on. Crawford.
- [Faint Howling]

Come here.

00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,563
- Think you can jack that thing?
- Piece of cake, man.

693
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,365
Finally, a ride out of this shit-hole.

694
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:37,566
Wait a minute.
That's the tow truck that ran us off the road.

695
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:43,579
- That's why Crawford here
is gonna go get it for us.
- [ Grunts ]

696
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:48,516
- Right, Crawford?
- [ Grunts ] I don't know about that, man.
I mean-

697
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:52,248
It's a truck.
Just run over there and check it out.

698
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:55,223
Come on! We got the cash.
Now let's get the hell out of here!

00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:57,556
No way, man! Send soldier boy, damn it!

from here as possible.

Fuck him. We don't need him anymore.

00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:25,203
You kill me,
and you're on your own- lost.

- Maybe I don't give a shit.
- He doesn't know anything! Can't you see that?

Whoa! Just wait a minute.
If you kill him now, we are fucked.

Now, you don't want to see me angry.
